00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.830
Prof: So welcome back
everybody.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.444
It probably will take a while
to wrestle your brains back to

00:00:09.444 --> 00:00:13.120
what we were talking about
before the break,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.620
but I'll do my best to help in
that endeavor.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:26.509
We're really finishing up the
first two-thirds of the course

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:35.374
by talking about John Rawls,
a very interesting figure and

00:00:35.374 --> 00:00:43.150
phenomenon in modern political
philosophy.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.991
We're finishing up the first
two-thirds of the course in the

00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:50.702
sense that this is the third
Enlightenment tradition we're

00:00:50.702 --> 00:00:53.850
talking about,
the first two having been

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.990
utilitarianism and Marxism.
 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.298
And after we finish with Rawls
we're going to talk about the

00:00:59.298 --> 00:01:03.000
anti-Enlightenment tradition and
then the democratic traditions.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.920
So Rawls is an odd figure in
some ways.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.555
If I had been here,
or if a predecessor from a

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:24.072
prior generation had been here
teaching a course like this in

00:01:24.072 --> 00:01:30.507
the 1950s or early 1960s,
and somebody had speculated

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:35.864
that maybe a very major figure
would emerge in American

00:01:35.864 --> 00:01:42.510
political philosophy there would
have been a lot of skepticism,

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.522
and there would have been even
more skepticism if somebody had

00:01:47.522 --> 00:01:49.739
said,
"And they would have been

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:51.870
a theorist of the social
contract."

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.016
And I think there would have
been two reasons for that

00:01:55.016 --> 00:01:55.790
skepticism.
 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.126
One is that political
philosophy was really not

00:02:00.126 --> 00:02:05.879
thought to be a particularly
important area of philosophy,

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:10.870
of academic philosophy in the
1950s and 1960s.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.872
The people who were sort of
seen as the cutting edge in

00:02:14.872 --> 00:02:18.430
philosophy were doing philosophy
of language,

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.238
logic, epistemology,
metaphysics,

00:02:21.238 --> 00:02:26.240
and political philosophy was
sort of way down on the totem

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.030
pole.
 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.546
It was a subdivision of ethics,
and sort of ethics for many

00:02:32.546 --> 00:02:34.639
people, if you like.
 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:39.270
And the notion that anybody in
philosophy who did political

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.740
philosophy would turn out to be
a major figure would have

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.690
attracted a lot of skepticism
among academic philosophers.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.550
And yet John Rawls,
I think today,

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.103
and if you polled,
if you went around the most

00:02:56.103 --> 00:03:00.128
prestigious philosophy
departments in the world,

00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:02.258
not just the English-speaking
world,

00:03:02.258 --> 00:03:05.051
today, and said,
"Who was the most

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:09.093
important philosopher of the
last third of the twentieth

00:03:09.093 --> 00:03:12.615
century,
not political philosopher just

00:03:12.615 --> 00:03:16.549
philosopher,"
and you ask that question of

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.680
people in major philosophy
departments around the world,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.110
Rawls would be cited more than
other person,

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.509
without any doubt about it.
 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:29.158
I don't have any doubt about it.
 

00:03:29.158 --> 00:03:31.870
He'd be cited more than any
other person.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.098
So that's one reason people
would have been skeptical that

00:03:36.098 --> 00:03:40.626
they just didn't think political
philosophy was that important

00:03:40.626 --> 00:03:44.560
and the sort of serious
heavyweights in philosophy did

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.970
other things.
 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.611
But then I think the second
reason people would have been

00:03:49.611 --> 00:03:53.190
skeptical is that a theorist of
the social contract,

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.800
and everybody knew that the
social contract,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.464
which as you all know,
has been around in its modern

00:03:58.464 --> 00:04:00.919
form at least since the
seventeenth century,

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.090
everybody knew it had these two
huge problems.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.043
One was that it didn't have any
grounding in natural law that

00:04:10.043 --> 00:04:14.706
people accepted,
and the second was it never was

00:04:14.706 --> 00:04:16.889
a social contract.
 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.464
We now know from 150 years of
anthropology there never was a

00:04:21.464 --> 00:04:22.860
social contract.
 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.129
Aristotle was closer to being
accurate when he sort of treated

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:29.860
human beings as inherently
political.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.199
There was never a pre-political
condition.

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.841
And as you now know,
because we've studied Robert

00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:39.985
Nozick,
the revival of the social

00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:44.862
contract tradition answered both
those questions first by

00:04:44.862 --> 00:04:49.824
replacing natural law with some
version of Immanuel Kant's

00:04:49.824 --> 00:04:50.870
ethics.
 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.509
So Kant becomes the placeholder
for natural law,

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.641
and on the other hand working
with hypothetical contracts

00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:03.480
rather than actual contracts
asking the question,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.310
"What would people agree
to?"

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.600
not "What did people agree
to under certain specified

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.028
conditions?"
 

00:05:11.028 --> 00:05:15.526
But neither of those ideas was
central to Nozick,

00:05:15.526 --> 00:05:17.870
was invented by Nozick.
 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.456
Rather both of those ideas were
invented by Rawls,

00:05:21.456 --> 00:05:25.629
and Nozick was one of many
people who reacted to Rawls.

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:30.370
I had pedagogical reasons for
dealing with Nozick first,

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.269
namely that his argument grows
so directly out of Locke's,

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:38.814
but if this was a course in the
history of twentieth-century

00:05:38.814 --> 00:05:42.660
political philosophy of course
we would have done Rawls first.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.351
And it's really important to
say this because Nozick's book

00:05:46.351 --> 00:05:49.279
would never have been written
but for Rawls.

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:53.536
And I think the one measure of
the importance of Rawls is that

00:05:53.536 --> 00:05:57.798
there are probably fifty books,
and I don't know how many

00:05:57.798 --> 00:06:02.259
articles that would never have
been written but for Rawls.

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:06.358
You can go and find Rawls's
book in the library and you'll

00:06:06.358 --> 00:06:10.601
find it on the shelf next to the
book just books listing the

00:06:10.601 --> 00:06:12.759
citations to Rawls's book.
 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:17.079
And so that's a very
interesting fact.

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:21.490
It's also an interesting fact
because Rawls is not a great in

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.430
the sense that we think of as
Hobbes,

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.910
Locke, or Mill,
or Dewey, who we don't read in

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.369
this course,
as greats in the sense that

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:39.822
most of those people had a view
of the world that ranged right

00:06:39.822 --> 00:06:44.100
across all domains of knowledge.
 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.670
So if you read Locke,
he had a view of knowledge,

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.497
a view of language,
a view of theology,

00:06:50.497 --> 00:06:54.310
a view of politics;
a view of everything.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.610
Mill had a theory of science.
 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.529
He had a mathematical theory.
 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:02.259
He had theories of meaning.
 

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:07.153
He had an epistemology,
and he had a theory of

00:07:07.153 --> 00:07:08.350
politics.
 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.653
Dewey, same story,
there's a whole worldview

00:07:11.653 --> 00:07:15.572
that's worked out in every what
we today think of as

00:07:15.572 --> 00:07:18.814
disciplines,
but for most of the tradition

00:07:18.814 --> 00:07:22.750
we're not divided up in the way
we divide things up today.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:29.555
But the people we tend to call
greats had a view that ranges

00:07:29.555 --> 00:07:33.940
across the whole gamut of
knowledge.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.600
Rawls didn't do that.
 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.370
He doesn't have a metaphysics.
 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.711
He doesn't have epistemology,
he doesn't have a theory of

00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:42.720
science, he doesn't have a
theory of language.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.470
He only wrote this book,
basically.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.920
He wrote some articles which
lead up to the book and then

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.569
some things that follow out of
the book,

00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:57.040
but basically his book A
Theory of Justice is it.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.990
And so he's not a great in that
sense of the greats of the

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.333
tradition,
but he certainly has more

00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:09.850
intellectual staying power than
any contemporary,

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:13.440
in the broad sense of the word,
that you've read in this course

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.180
or will read in this course.
 

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:20.156
People will still be reading
Rawls long after people like me

00:08:20.156 --> 00:08:22.519
have been forgotten about.
 

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:27.339
So in that sense he's a really
important figure,

00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:32.198
and he's a really important
figure also in the sense that

00:08:32.198 --> 00:08:35.668
even if you don't like his
arguments,

00:08:35.668 --> 00:08:39.336
even if you are completely
un-persuaded by all of his

00:08:39.336 --> 00:08:42.649
arguments you have to come to
grips with him.

00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:47.414
I'm not in sympathy with any of
his major arguments,

00:08:47.414 --> 00:08:52.554
but you cannot work in this
field and not deal with John

00:08:52.554 --> 00:08:53.490
Rawls.
 

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.620
That's how important he is,
and he's going to be for a long

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.120
time.
 

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.855
So that's just by way of
background and letting you know

00:09:02.855 --> 00:09:05.178
what you're dealing with.
 

00:09:05.178 --> 00:09:09.407
One other thing I'd say about
A Theory of Justice is,

00:09:09.407 --> 00:09:11.700
it is not a well-written book.
 

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.129
It's not badly written in the
sense that it's unclear.

00:09:16.129 --> 00:09:20.225
Any given paragraph is clear
enough if you sit down and

00:09:20.225 --> 00:09:22.500
figure out the jargon means.
 

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:29.303
It's not hard in the sense
that, say, the technical sides

00:09:29.303 --> 00:09:35.500
of Marx or Pareto are hard,
but it's not captivating

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.960
writing.
 

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.461
You need a chair with a hard
back to read this book,

00:09:40.461 --> 00:09:42.658
and there's a reason for that.
 

00:09:42.658 --> 00:09:48.038
The reason is that although the
book was published in 1971,

00:09:48.038 --> 00:09:52.475
Rawls actually came up with the
main ideas in the 1960s in a

00:09:52.475 --> 00:09:55.625
couple of articles,
the most famous of which was

00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:57.548
called Justice as
Fairness,

00:09:57.548 --> 00:10:01.240
and he circulated these
articles in the profession,

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.658
in the philosophy profession,
and he kept getting criticisms.

00:10:04.658 --> 00:10:07.928
And eventually he had book
manuscript, and he circulated

00:10:07.928 --> 00:10:11.080
the book manuscript and he kept
getting criticisms.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.753
And every time somebody sent
him a criticism he added three

00:10:14.753 --> 00:10:17.158
paragraphs to address the
criticism.

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:21.089
This is not the way to write a
book if you want it to be

00:10:21.089 --> 00:10:22.090
captivating.
 

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:25.549
So it's got this kind
of--almost plodding quality

00:10:25.549 --> 00:10:29.947
that's sort of at variance with
the hype I just gave you about

00:10:29.947 --> 00:10:32.876
his importance,
but it's to do with the

00:10:32.876 --> 00:10:37.062
composition of the book,
I mean, there's ten years of

00:10:37.062 --> 00:10:40.730
endlessly fiddling with this
manuscript.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:46.471
And I should also say that he
eventually did a second edition

00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:52.865
of the book later in his life,
which is a substantial rewrite

00:10:52.865 --> 00:10:56.100
of it from the first edition.
 

00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.086
So he was somebody who couldn't
stop fiddling,

00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:04.695
and it's not a trait to which I
would commend to you,

00:11:04.695 --> 00:11:07.620
but in any event there it is.
 

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:11.620
And it's a long,
and if not plodding,

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:16.518
certainly ponderous book,
and my goal in these lectures

00:11:16.518 --> 00:11:21.690
about Rawls is to try pull out
the main ideas for you,

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.820
and particularly the main
enduring ideas.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.162
Because Rawls,
like everybody else we've read,

00:11:28.162 --> 00:11:30.909
as an architectonic theorist
fails.

00:11:30.909 --> 00:11:33.279
The pieces don't add up.
 

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:36.298
There are big logical holes in
the big structure.

00:11:36.298 --> 00:11:40.188
So if you want it to be the
silver bullet or the final word

00:11:40.188 --> 00:11:42.000
it's not going to happen.
 

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.779
Nonetheless,
there are very important

00:11:44.779 --> 00:11:49.335
enduring insights and questions
Rawls put on the table which

00:11:49.335 --> 00:11:54.121
have not gone away and are not
going to go away for anybody who

00:11:54.121 --> 00:11:57.904
wants to think about the
fundamentals of political

00:11:57.904 --> 00:11:59.450
association.
 

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:04.100
So what are these ideas?
 

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:09.034
Well, they get,
I think, mixed up to some

00:12:09.034 --> 00:12:11.692
extent,
or hidden, or obscured,

00:12:11.692 --> 00:12:14.849
or made to seem more
complicated than they should be

00:12:14.849 --> 00:12:18.129
partly because of the
architecture of his theory,

00:12:18.129 --> 00:12:23.038
partly because of the way he
does the exposition.

00:12:23.038 --> 00:12:26.703
He has this story about the
original position,

00:12:26.703 --> 00:12:31.509
which is his version of the
hypothetical social contract.

00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:35.663
And let me just give you the
intuition, but I want to preface

00:12:35.663 --> 00:12:39.610
it by saying it's actually not
important to his theory.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:44.910
It's really an expository
device because what he does is

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:48.668
he structures a hypothetical
choice,

00:12:48.668 --> 00:12:52.750
and then he gives you certain
kinds of information to get you

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.788
to choose a certain outcome.
 

00:12:54.788 --> 00:13:00.633
So unless the outcome is itself
independently desirable,

00:13:00.633 --> 00:13:06.687
the fact that this thought
experiment leads to it is of no

00:13:06.687 --> 00:13:08.070
interest.
 

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.644
Let me give you an example
before we get into Rawls,

00:13:11.644 --> 00:13:14.240
which is one that he himself
gives.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.208
I'm not sure if it's one of the
excerpts you read or not,

00:13:18.208 --> 00:13:22.321
but this is an observation that
has been around long before

00:13:22.321 --> 00:13:23.028
Rawls.
 

00:13:23.028 --> 00:13:25.950
He says, "What is the fair
way to cut a cake?"

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.494
Is this in what you read
anybody, "What's the fair

00:13:28.494 --> 00:13:29.720
way to cut a cake?"
 

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.765
Probably not,
I'm sure you spent your spring

00:13:33.765 --> 00:13:36.590
break reading through Rawls.
 

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:37.150
Yeah?
 

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:41.980
Student: 
&gt;

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.788
Prof: Correct.
 

00:13:43.788 --> 00:13:47.924
So the person with the knife
gets the last slice,

00:13:47.924 --> 00:13:50.080
and what will they do?
 

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.825
Student: 
&gt;.

00:13:53.825 --> 00:13:57.750
Prof: But how will they
divide it?

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.869
Student: 
&gt;.

00:14:00.869 --> 00:14:04.136
Prof: There are two
assumptions there,

00:14:04.136 --> 00:14:04.879
okay?
 

00:14:04.879 --> 00:14:07.259
You say, "What's the fair
way to cut a cake?"

00:14:07.259 --> 00:14:10.985
The answer: "The fair way
to cut a cake is the person with

00:14:10.985 --> 00:14:13.269
the knife gets the last
slice."

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:14.658
What will they do?
 

00:14:14.658 --> 00:14:17.649
They will divide it equally,
right?

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:21.735
That's how the person with the
knife gets the biggest possible

00:14:21.735 --> 00:14:22.740
slice, right?
 

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:27.168
Right, yeah?
 

00:14:27.168 --> 00:14:33.648
Anyone think that's not the
fair way to cut a cake

00:14:33.648 --> 00:14:35.500
intuitively?
 

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.183
Okay, well there are two
assumptions there that are worth

00:14:39.183 --> 00:14:43.197
bringing to the fore just for
purpose of what I'm going to say

00:14:43.197 --> 00:14:45.500
to you about Rawls in a minute.
 

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:51.106
One is that we think dividing
the cake equally is the right,

00:14:51.106 --> 00:14:56.333
you know, we've devised a
system where the cakes can get

00:14:56.333 --> 00:14:58.899
equally divided,
right?

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:02.759
But do we think it should be
equally divided?

00:15:02.759 --> 00:15:07.544
What if I added other
information like one of the

00:15:07.544 --> 00:15:13.826
people in the room was starving
and hadn't eaten for three days,

00:15:13.826 --> 00:15:16.418
or one was a diabetic?
 

00:15:16.418 --> 00:15:20.580
We could add other information
which would make you wonder,

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.879
do you want to get an equal
division, right?

00:15:23.879 --> 00:15:27.307
So the cake-cutting example
doesn't show you that equality

00:15:27.307 --> 00:15:28.389
is a good thing.
 

00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:32.857
It presumes that you've already
decided equality's a good thing

00:15:32.857 --> 00:15:36.389
and you want to get the person
to choose equality,

00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:37.110
right?
 

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:42.928
Then the other thing it assumes
is that people are going to

00:15:42.928 --> 00:15:46.340
behave self-interestedly,
right?

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.534
When we give the person the
knife and say,

00:15:48.534 --> 00:15:50.408
"Divide it however you
like.

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:55.061
You get the last slice,"
we're assuming that she or he

00:15:55.061 --> 00:15:58.750
will want to get the biggest
possible slice.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:03.302
So immediately we've got two
assumptions built into there,

00:16:03.302 --> 00:16:06.100
one that equality's a good
thing.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.731
That's the result we actually
do want to get,

00:16:08.731 --> 00:16:11.605
and secondly that people are
going to behave in a

00:16:11.605 --> 00:16:13.460
self-interested way,
right?

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:18.788
Which isn't to say they're bad
assumptions, but it's to note

00:16:18.788 --> 00:16:21.860
that they are assumptions,
okay?

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.745
Now, Rawls' original position
has the same structure as the

00:16:26.745 --> 00:16:30.200
cake cutting for both of those
reasons.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:36.568
He has a distributive outcome
that he wants to convince you is

00:16:36.568 --> 00:16:41.062
a good thing,
and he's going to create a

00:16:41.062 --> 00:16:46.923
hypothetical choice situation
that will lead you to it,

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:47.899
right?
 

00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:51.994
But that doesn't itself
establish that it is a good

00:16:51.994 --> 00:16:52.649
thing.
 

00:16:52.649 --> 00:16:55.206
You have to have some other
argument to convince you that it

00:16:55.206 --> 00:16:57.102
is a good thing,
and I'll tell you what that

00:16:57.102 --> 00:16:59.745
argument is,
but it's completely independent

00:16:59.745 --> 00:17:03.918
of this expository device that's
modeled on the cake cutting.

00:17:03.918 --> 00:17:07.866
So the expository device that's
modeled on the cake cutting goes

00:17:07.866 --> 00:17:08.618
like this.
 

00:17:08.618 --> 00:17:15.492
It says imagine you had to
design a social order,

00:17:15.492 --> 00:17:22.078
a society in the broadest sense
of the word.

00:17:22.078 --> 00:17:24.740
It will include an economic
system,

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:31.144
a political system and so on,
and you didn't know whether you

00:17:31.144 --> 00:17:35.950
were going to turn out to be
rich or poor,

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:40.200
male or female,
what race you were going to be,

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.068
whether you were going to be an
athlete or a nerd.

00:17:43.068 --> 00:17:48.650
You didn't have any particular
information about yourself,

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:52.410
whether you're going to have a
high IQ or a low IQ,

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.859
musical, not musical,
good athlete,

00:17:54.859 --> 00:17:56.818
a bad athlete, nothing.
 

00:17:56.818 --> 00:18:01.088
You didn't have that kind of
information about yourself,

00:18:01.088 --> 00:18:05.748
which doesn't mean that there
could be people who didn't have

00:18:05.748 --> 00:18:08.308
those characteristics,
right?

00:18:08.308 --> 00:18:11.760
Just like say you had to design
the rules of chess and you

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.272
didn't know whether or not
you're going to be good at using

00:18:15.272 --> 00:18:17.291
bishop,
better at using a bishop than

00:18:17.291 --> 00:18:20.846
using a knight,
but you had to agree on certain

00:18:20.846 --> 00:18:22.019
rules, okay?
 

00:18:22.019 --> 00:18:27.202
So the rules for designing
society you're going to choose

00:18:27.202 --> 00:18:32.661
while being ignorant of what he
calls particular facts about

00:18:32.661 --> 00:18:34.788
your circumstances.
 

00:18:34.788 --> 00:18:38.741
You're going to know only
certain pretty general things

00:18:38.741 --> 00:18:41.888
like he says,
"It's a world of moderate

00:18:41.888 --> 00:18:43.279
scarcity."
 

00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:47.160
So it's not superabundance,
which is a good thing,

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:51.595
because we found out when we
studied Marx that there's no

00:18:51.595 --> 00:18:54.048
coherent of superabundance.
 

00:18:54.048 --> 00:18:57.140
Moderate scarcity,
it's not a developing country,

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.487
what we think of today as a
third world or developing

00:19:00.487 --> 00:19:01.259
country.
 

00:19:01.259 --> 00:19:07.334
It's basically principles for
countries of the sort we live

00:19:07.334 --> 00:19:10.788
in, okay, so moderate scarcity.
 

00:19:10.788 --> 00:19:15.719
And we're going to assume
certain basic what he calls laws

00:19:15.719 --> 00:19:20.452
of psychology and economics,
and I think that people largely

00:19:20.452 --> 00:19:24.230
behave self-interestedly is the
most important of those.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.605
But beyond that you're not
going to have particular

00:19:27.605 --> 00:19:30.980
knowledge about yourself and
your circumstances.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.423
In particular,
sorry to use particular in two

00:19:34.423 --> 00:19:37.115
conflicting ways,
but in particular,

00:19:37.115 --> 00:19:40.615
you're not going to have the
kind of knowledge that would

00:19:40.615 --> 00:19:43.740
allow you to bias things in your
own direction.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:48.970
So that if you knew you were
going to turn out to be female

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:54.019
you could say women should earn
twice as much as men,

00:19:54.019 --> 00:19:55.905
but you're not going to know
whether you're going to turn out

00:19:55.905 --> 00:19:56.630
to be female or male.
 

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:00.457
So the kind of knowledge you're
going to be denied is the kind

00:20:00.457 --> 00:20:04.285
of knowledge that would let you
bias things in your own favor,

00:20:04.285 --> 00:20:04.848
okay?
 

00:20:04.848 --> 00:20:13.630
So that's the sense in which
he's trying to be Kantian.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:18.279
He calls his principles,
"procedural expressions of

00:20:18.279 --> 00:20:21.240
the categorical
imperative."

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.017
There's a mouthful for you on
the first day back from spring

00:20:25.017 --> 00:20:25.528
break.
 

00:20:25.528 --> 00:20:28.335
We know what the categorical
imperative is,

00:20:28.335 --> 00:20:28.868
right?
 

00:20:28.868 --> 00:20:39.578
It's the imperative to choose
things that are universalizable,

00:20:39.578 --> 00:20:42.858
things that you would will
regardless of the consequence,

00:20:42.858 --> 00:20:47.808
so things you would will from
every conceivable standpoint.

00:20:47.808 --> 00:20:50.478
And what Rawls is trying to do
when he says there's a

00:20:50.478 --> 00:20:53.681
procedural expression of it,
what he's trying to do is say,

00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:56.432
"Well,
if you don't have knowledge of

00:20:56.432 --> 00:21:00.471
which kind of person you're
going to turn out to be in terms

00:21:00.471 --> 00:21:02.634
of rich or poor,
or male or female,

00:21:02.634 --> 00:21:04.405
or black or white,
or Hispanic,

00:21:04.405 --> 00:21:08.990
or some other ethnic group,
or religious of some sort,

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:11.930
or atheist,
you don't know any of those

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:12.440
things.
 

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:17.932
You're going to have to think
about, what are the best social

00:21:17.932 --> 00:21:23.150
rules for people regardless of
who they turn out to be?

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:27.907
And that's the sense in which
he wants to think of himself as

00:21:27.907 --> 00:21:28.858
a Kantian.
 

00:21:28.858 --> 00:21:32.473
So whereas for Nozick it's sort
of just a slogan,

00:21:32.473 --> 00:21:36.388
for Rawls it's really built
into the structure of his

00:21:36.388 --> 00:21:37.818
argument, okay?
 

00:21:37.818 --> 00:21:41.160
And the idea of the original
position is to force us,

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.269
even while recognizing we're
self-interested,

00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:52.058
to force us to think about
society as a whole,

00:21:52.058 --> 00:21:55.561
to think about what would be
desirable regardless of who you

00:21:55.561 --> 00:21:56.690
turned out to be.
 

00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:01.440
And so then the basic way the
book,

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.269
if you had time to read the
whole book,

00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:09.016
the basic way the book proceeds
is he starts out with this

00:22:09.016 --> 00:22:14.012
complete veil of ignorance and
tries to get you to agree with

00:22:14.012 --> 00:22:14.680
him.
 

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:19.410
In this sense it's not even
really a social contract.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:22.436
He's not saying,
"Would you agree with one

00:22:22.436 --> 00:22:23.490
another?"
 

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:26.200
What he wants to say is,
"Will you,

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.180
the reader, agree with me,
John Rawls,

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:35.255
that any rational person would
choose the principles that I'm

00:22:35.255 --> 00:22:37.279
arguing for?"
 

00:22:37.279 --> 00:22:40.819
In that sense he's actually--we
can't do it in this course

00:22:40.819 --> 00:22:45.696
because we didn't read Hobbes,
he's actually more like Hobbes

00:22:45.696 --> 00:22:51.258
than he is like Locke because
for Hobbes the social contract

00:22:51.258 --> 00:22:55.500
isn't legitimate because anybody
made it,

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:59.680
but because it must be rational
to make it.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.958
Any rational person,
says Hobbes,

00:23:01.958 --> 00:23:06.230
would agree to give up their
freedom to an absolute sovereign

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:10.858
because anything else leads to
civil war and is just madness.

00:23:10.858 --> 00:23:14.546
So it's a property of
rationality for Hobbes that

00:23:14.546 --> 00:23:18.539
people will accept the authority
of the sovereign.

00:23:18.539 --> 00:23:20.328
It isn't really a contract.
 

00:23:20.328 --> 00:23:23.069
Well, Rawls is more like Hobbes
on that point.

00:23:23.069 --> 00:23:28.605
He saying, "I, John Rawls,
want to persuade you,

00:23:28.605 --> 00:23:32.335
the reader, that any rational
person would choose my

00:23:32.335 --> 00:23:36.356
principles of justice over the
going alternatives,"

00:23:36.356 --> 00:23:41.508
because his style of thinking--
people go on and on about Rawls

00:23:41.508 --> 00:23:44.134
being abstract,
and an ideal theorist,

00:23:44.134 --> 00:23:47.711
and head in the clouds,
but actually his actual way of

00:23:47.711 --> 00:23:49.369
proceeding isn't that.
 

00:23:49.369 --> 00:23:51.019
It's comparative.
 

00:23:51.019 --> 00:23:53.931
Basically what he does is he
says, "Well,

00:23:53.931 --> 00:23:56.519
what are the going
alternatives?"

00:23:56.519 --> 00:23:57.788
There's utilitarianism.
 

00:23:57.788 --> 00:24:02.170
There are other ones you
haven't read in this course.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:05.366
There's perfectionism,
which is what he thinks of in

00:24:05.366 --> 00:24:06.119
Aristotle.
 

00:24:06.119 --> 00:24:07.828
There's Marxism.
 

00:24:07.828 --> 00:24:11.967
"I want to show you that
my principle does better than

00:24:11.967 --> 00:24:16.460
the going alternatives from the
perspective of being behind this

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.028
veil of ignorance.
 

00:24:18.028 --> 00:24:21.369
If somebody else comes along
with another principle and shows

00:24:21.369 --> 00:24:24.375
that it does even better than
mine then I would give it

00:24:24.375 --> 00:24:25.098
up."
 

00:24:25.098 --> 00:24:29.063
So his basic mode of reasoning
is comparative,

00:24:29.063 --> 00:24:29.680
okay?
 

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:36.212
And so what he does is he has a
general principle of justice

00:24:36.212 --> 00:24:42.855
which he wants to persuade you
of first from behind this veil

00:24:42.855 --> 00:24:46.767
of ignorance,
and then more specific

00:24:46.767 --> 00:24:48.509
applications of it.
 

00:24:48.509 --> 00:24:52.788
He ends up coming up with two
principles of justice that are

00:24:52.788 --> 00:24:56.415
the applications which are
really three principles,

00:24:56.415 --> 00:24:59.098
so I'll go through them with
you.

00:24:59.098 --> 00:25:03.989
But as you went more and more
into the book he keeps adding

00:25:03.989 --> 00:25:09.132
information and lets you design
more specific institutions and

00:25:09.132 --> 00:25:12.597
so on,
always with the caveat that as

00:25:12.597 --> 00:25:17.335
you get more information later
you can't go back and undo

00:25:17.335 --> 00:25:20.720
choices that you made earlier,
right?

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:25.203
So it's sort of like--I don't
know if you've been around long

00:25:25.203 --> 00:25:29.763
enough to ever see Congress go
through a base closing exercise

00:25:29.763 --> 00:25:34.173
for the military where they
realize that there's going to be

00:25:34.173 --> 00:25:38.594
special pleading from every,
you know, say they're going to

00:25:38.594 --> 00:25:40.640
get rid of thirty military
bases.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.990
Every congressional district
that has a base in it is going

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:49.067
to have good reasons why--
"Yes, we should get rid of

00:25:49.067 --> 00:25:51.551
30 bases,
but not the one in our

00:25:51.551 --> 00:25:52.930
district, right?
 

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:58.367
We don't want to stop making
submarines in Groton,"

00:25:58.367 --> 00:25:59.160
right?
 

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.778
Whatever it is.
 

00:26:00.778 --> 00:26:06.769
And so what they do is they
create a commission that agrees

00:26:06.769 --> 00:26:12.218
on the base closing nationwide,
and they have to vote up or

00:26:12.218 --> 00:26:16.339
down on the entire package,
and then they can't start

00:26:16.339 --> 00:26:17.808
undoing it later.
 

00:26:17.808 --> 00:26:21.991
So this has a kind of structure
of a base closing commission

00:26:21.991 --> 00:26:25.750
that as the veil of ignorance
starts to be lifted,

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:30.383
and then you discover well
actually I turn out to be female

00:26:30.383 --> 00:26:33.338
rather than male I can't then
say,

00:26:33.338 --> 00:26:36.432
"Oh, well women should get
certain particular kind of

00:26:36.432 --> 00:26:37.788
advantage,"
right?

00:26:37.788 --> 00:26:40.680
So that's the way the book
proceeds.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:51.298
Now I think one other reason I
should tell you about--

00:26:51.298 --> 00:26:54.759
or actually two reasons I
should tell you about,

00:26:54.759 --> 00:26:58.558
concerning why this book had
such a big impact,

00:26:58.558 --> 00:27:03.068
why this book has had the
staying power that it's had.

00:27:03.068 --> 00:27:08.138
One is it's really very much a
book of the 1960s and '70s when

00:27:08.138 --> 00:27:10.311
there was,
to some extent,

00:27:10.311 --> 00:27:14.609
a crisis of confidence about
liberal democratic institutions

00:27:14.609 --> 00:27:18.847
born of the students' movement,
and the Vietnam War,

00:27:18.847 --> 00:27:21.720
and everything that went with
it.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.559
That is to say there was a
generation of people who thought

00:27:25.559 --> 00:27:28.869
we needed to have critical
standards for evaluating

00:27:28.869 --> 00:27:31.250
government,
and utilitarianism,

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:34.029
which was the main alternative
around,

00:27:34.029 --> 00:27:36.400
didn't seem to provide them.
 

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:41.137
And Rawls came up with this
notion that we could come up

00:27:41.137 --> 00:27:44.930
with an independent standard for
judging,

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:48.950
actually existing political
systems,

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:53.288
and then use it to see how they
measure up.

00:27:53.288 --> 00:27:57.709
It wouldn't have to be rooted
in natural law and all the

00:27:57.709 --> 00:28:00.038
problems that went with it.
 

00:28:00.038 --> 00:28:02.220
It was going to be rooted in
this universal Kantian ideal,

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.671
and it would give us principles
by which we could evaluate not

00:28:06.671 --> 00:28:11.108
only what our government does,
but other governments.

00:28:11.108 --> 00:28:14.393
So I think it was,
to some extent,

00:28:14.393 --> 00:28:20.560
the kind of thirst for criteria
that was characteristic of that

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:24.740
era that gave Rawls his staying
power.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.009
But then I think the other
reason,

00:28:27.009 --> 00:28:33.286
the other reason that Rawls had
staying power was that he

00:28:33.286 --> 00:28:40.010
changed the subject that people
who had been squabbling about

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:46.400
utilitarianism for 150 years had
been arguing about,

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:50.612
because--and again,
you know this now because of

00:28:50.612 --> 00:28:56.515
the first half of this semester,
but utilitarianism had

00:28:56.515 --> 00:29:02.548
basically been struggling
between two variants.

00:29:02.548 --> 00:29:06.239
One, which we think of in the
terminology of this course as

00:29:06.239 --> 00:29:10.459
classical utilitarianism,
we might call objectivist where

00:29:10.459 --> 00:29:14.630
you make strong interpersonal
judgments of utility,

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:17.150
and the problem with that as we
saw,

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.278
and as Rawls says repeatedly in
his book,

00:29:20.278 --> 00:29:24.259
it doesn't take seriously the
differences among persons.

00:29:24.259 --> 00:29:28.690
You could see this in the
utility monster example.

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:33.315
You could see this in the
problems that we have with the

00:29:33.315 --> 00:29:35.670
bag lady and Donald Trump.
 

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:38.130
You can see this in problems
with the disabled.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:41.910
That if you don't allow
interpersonal--

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:46.015
I'm sorry, if you do allow
interpersonal judgments of

00:29:46.015 --> 00:29:50.751
utility you can do Draconian
things in the name of maximizing

00:29:50.751 --> 00:29:51.700
utility.
 

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.157
But if you say,
"No we're not going to do

00:29:54.157 --> 00:29:56.890
that," and you make the
neoclassical move,

00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:00.150
and you then say,
"We cannot even allow that

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:03.886
taking a nickel from Trump and
giving it to the bag lady

00:30:03.886 --> 00:30:07.691
necessarily leads to an increase
in social utility,"

00:30:07.691 --> 00:30:11.019
then you seem to have the
opposite problem.

00:30:11.019 --> 00:30:16.713
So the objectivist problem is
it allows people to be used in

00:30:16.713 --> 00:30:19.900
the name of maximizing utility.
 

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:24.186
The subjectivist version,
the neoclassical version

00:30:24.186 --> 00:30:28.650
doesn't seem to allow any
interpersonal judgments of

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:29.700
utility.
 

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.690
Both are deeply morally
unsatisfying,

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:38.464
and the proponents of each one
tend to make the case for their

00:30:38.464 --> 00:30:43.863
view mainly by pointing to the
demerits of the other view,

00:30:43.863 --> 00:30:44.809
right?
 

00:30:44.809 --> 00:30:46.480
And they're both right.
 

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.720
Both of these views have
serious demerits.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:53.519
And so part of what Rawls does
is he changes the subject.

00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:57.221
He changes the subject,
and he changes it in an

00:30:57.221 --> 00:30:58.670
interesting way.
 

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:02.931
He says, "Look,
the truth is we should be

00:31:02.931 --> 00:31:08.328
objectivist about some things
and subjectivist about other

00:31:08.328 --> 00:31:09.940
things."
 

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.180
And what does he mean by this?
 

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:17.082
He says, "Look,
people are substantially alike

00:31:17.082 --> 00:31:22.278
on some dimensions and unalike
on other dimensions.

00:31:22.278 --> 00:31:26.821
There's deep pluralism of
values, yes, but we basically

00:31:26.821 --> 00:31:30.440
have the same needs,
the same physiology.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:35.406
We tend to need the same kinds
of resources,

00:31:35.406 --> 00:31:41.529
so let's focus on resources
rather than on utility.

00:31:41.529 --> 00:31:45.538
Let's focus on some basic
resources that everybody needs

00:31:45.538 --> 00:31:49.838
regardless of whether they're
going to be intellectuals,

00:31:49.838 --> 00:31:53.450
or artists, or sportsmen,
or sportswomen,

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:56.130
or politicians.
 

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:59.921
There are certain things you're
going to need more of rather

00:31:59.921 --> 00:32:02.596
than less of,
other things being equal,

00:32:02.596 --> 00:32:06.220
sort of instrumental goods you
could think of them as.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:08.308
And let's focus on that."
 

00:32:08.308 --> 00:32:13.513
And especially in political
theory those are a good thing to

00:32:13.513 --> 00:32:18.365
focus on because after all,
we're talking about what the

00:32:18.365 --> 00:32:21.190
state might or might not do.
 

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:23.273
And the state,
as we all know,

00:32:23.273 --> 00:32:25.430
acts with blunt instruments.
 

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:28.854
This idea of the government
sort of putting a utilitometer

00:32:28.854 --> 00:32:32.460
under people's tongues to find
out what their utility is,

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:38.609
apart from being technically
problematic,

00:32:38.609 --> 00:32:40.460
nobody wants that.
 

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.730
It's morally undesirable.
 

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:46.676
So you have to think about the
state as something that acts

00:32:46.676 --> 00:32:50.078
with blunt instruments and you
can only really--

00:32:50.078 --> 00:32:54.286
if you want a realistic
political theory you should

00:32:54.286 --> 00:32:59.670
focus on some basic resources in
the society that the state could

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:01.690
have some impact on.
 

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:06.657
So instead of various competing
definitions of utility or

00:33:06.657 --> 00:33:11.053
welfare Rawls says,
"Let's change the subject

00:33:11.053 --> 00:33:15.615
to talking about resources that
have the quality (a) that

00:33:15.615 --> 00:33:20.502
they're things that we could
really imagine the state dealing

00:33:20.502 --> 00:33:23.204
with,
and (b) that are instrumentally

00:33:23.204 --> 00:33:26.523
valuable to people no matter
what they turn out to want in

00:33:26.523 --> 00:33:27.338
life."
 

00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:31.009
So that's a second reason he's
important.

00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:37.661
Academics are not comfortable
unless they create an -ism word,

00:33:37.661 --> 00:33:41.259
so the -ism word is resourcism.
 

00:33:41.259 --> 00:33:43.440
Rawls actually is saying
resourcism.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.220
Stop talking about welfarism.
 

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:51.413
Stop talking about utility,
or welfare, or the subjective

00:33:51.413 --> 00:33:55.682
experiences that people get,
but rather the resources that

00:33:55.682 --> 00:33:58.078
they have at their disposal.
 

00:33:58.078 --> 00:34:01.200
So that's a second reason,
I think,

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.900
his views have had a lot of
staying power,

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:07.665
and people who don't like his
particular resourcist theory

00:34:07.665 --> 00:34:11.300
have nonetheless embraced other
resourcist theories,

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.670
again, sort of in the wake of
Rawls,

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:15.429
if you like.
 

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:18.980
Okay, so what is the basic idea?
 

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.829
What is the basic principle?
 

00:34:20.829 --> 00:34:26.309
It's his general conception of
justice,

00:34:26.309 --> 00:34:29.639
of which he says "All
social values,"

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:34.199
by which he means resources as
I've just said it to you now,

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:37.130
and he's going to say that
there are three--

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:43.329
well, he talks about liberties,
opportunities,

00:34:43.329 --> 00:34:47.139
income and wealth,
which he treats together.

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:49.889
So that's three,
and then a fourth one,

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:51.838
the social bases of
self-respect,

00:34:51.838 --> 00:34:54.579
I'll come back to all of that
in a minute--

00:34:54.579 --> 00:34:58.208
"are to be distributed
equally unless an unequal

00:34:58.208 --> 00:35:02.253
distribution of any or all of
these values is to everyone's

00:35:02.253 --> 00:35:03.650
advantage."
 

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:06.139
That is the basic idea.
 

00:35:06.139 --> 00:35:10.670
All social values,
by which he means resources,

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:16.481
should be distributed equally
unless an unequal distribution

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:18.650
benefits everyone.
 

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:22.436
That is the first and most
general formulation of his

00:35:22.436 --> 00:35:23.309
principle.
 

00:35:23.309 --> 00:35:31.849
So let me just backup a little
bit.

00:35:31.849 --> 00:35:34.615
I'll go through liberties,
opportunities,

00:35:34.615 --> 00:35:38.489
income and wealth in more
detail starting in a minute.

00:35:38.489 --> 00:35:42.237
I'm just going to mention the
social bases for self-respect

00:35:42.237 --> 00:35:45.920
briefly and then not talk about
it anymore because of time

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.233
limitations,
and because Rawls himself never

00:35:49.233 --> 00:35:54.936
says anything much about them,
and what he has to say I don't

00:35:54.936 --> 00:35:57.670
think is very coherent.
 

00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:02.313
So we'll just forget about the
social bases of self-respect for

00:36:02.313 --> 00:36:05.610
the moment, maybe come back to
them later.

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:08.918
But so here's the thing,
"...are to be distributed

00:36:08.918 --> 00:36:11.737
equally unless an unequal
distribution works to

00:36:11.737 --> 00:36:13.699
everybody's advantage."
 

00:36:13.699 --> 00:36:17.349
 
 

00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:20.588
Now you might say,
"Why?"

00:36:20.588 --> 00:36:21.349
right?
 

00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:24.409
And that's the first question,
right?

00:36:24.409 --> 00:36:26.130
It's the first question you ask.
 

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:28.260
And Rawls is not going to give
you a straight answer.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.820
There's not a
"because"

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.940
for the reason I said to you
earlier.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.869
His reasoning is comparative.
 

00:36:36.869 --> 00:36:39.695
So he says, "Well,
you could say this is one

00:36:39.695 --> 00:36:40.989
candidate principle.
 

00:36:40.989 --> 00:36:44.554
You bring another candidate
principle like say

00:36:44.554 --> 00:36:47.967
utilitarianism,
and we'll look at both from

00:36:47.967 --> 00:36:52.456
behind the veil of ignorance and
see which makes more sense to

00:36:52.456 --> 00:36:53.929
pick," okay?
 

00:36:53.929 --> 00:36:57.393
So that's the sense in which he
has a comparative-advantage

00:36:57.393 --> 00:37:00.327
argument,
not a knockdown philosophical

00:37:00.327 --> 00:37:04.074
demonstration from first
principles that this must

00:37:04.074 --> 00:37:04.840
follow.
 

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:08.708
So while I do want to say that
he thinks it follows from the

00:37:08.708 --> 00:37:12.119
nature of reason that you would
make this choice,

00:37:12.119 --> 00:37:17.132
it's only a comparative choice
and somebody could come along

00:37:17.132 --> 00:37:22.570
with something else and convince
you that it does better than his

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:26.650
principle and then he'd have to
accept that.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:35.664
So what he does,
and this is his resourcism in

00:37:35.664 --> 00:37:44.480
action, is he defines these
primary goods.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.496
Primary goods are these
instrumental goods,

00:37:47.496 --> 00:37:50.942
these things you would,
other things being equal,

00:37:50.942 --> 00:37:53.599
rather have more of than less
of.

00:37:53.599 --> 00:37:59.197
And the three we're going to
focus on are liberties,

00:37:59.197 --> 00:38:03.480
opportunities,
and income and wealth.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.809
We'll probably only manage to
deal with liberties today,

00:38:06.809 --> 00:38:10.260
but it'll give you a flavor of
how his reasoning works.

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:15.130
So, what are liberties?
 

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:18.208
Well, they're pretty much the
sort of thing in the Bill of

00:38:18.208 --> 00:38:20.610
Rights,
in the American Bill of Rights:

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:23.115
freedom of speech,
freedom of religion,

00:38:23.115 --> 00:38:26.769
freedom of association,
freedom, actually,

00:38:26.769 --> 00:38:33.168
to participate in democratic
politics is one that he talks

00:38:33.168 --> 00:38:34.179
about.
 

00:38:34.179 --> 00:38:39.570
And his principle for the
distribution of liberties is,

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:45.253
I just put it up there,
he says, "Each person is

00:38:45.253 --> 00:38:51.704
to have an equal right to the
most extensive system of total

00:38:51.704 --> 00:38:55.659
extensive"--
I told you he is ponderous,

00:38:55.659 --> 00:38:59.407
"...extensive total system
of liberties compatible with a

00:38:59.407 --> 00:39:02.050
similar system of liberty for
all."

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:06.121
Sounds like a lot of words not
saying very much,

00:39:06.121 --> 00:39:11.492
so let me show you why it says
more than it might appear to say

00:39:11.492 --> 00:39:13.139
at first sight.
 

00:39:13.139 --> 00:39:21.139
Let's take the example of
religious freedom.

00:39:21.139 --> 00:39:28.545
So let's say,
"Well, should we have an

00:39:28.545 --> 00:39:33.659
established religion?"
 

00:39:33.659 --> 00:39:41.099
 
 

00:39:41.099 --> 00:39:44.224
How can we reason about this
from behind the veil of

00:39:44.224 --> 00:39:44.960
ignorance?
 

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.940
We don't know,
once the veil of ignorance is

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.289
lifted,
whether we're going to be

00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:54.405
Christians,
or Jews, or Muslims,

00:39:54.405 --> 00:39:56.500
or atheists,
or agnostics,

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.480
or something else, right?
 

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:02.360
We don't know that, right?
 

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:07.306
So how should we think about
the question of whether there

00:40:07.306 --> 00:40:10.429
should be an established
religion?

00:40:10.429 --> 00:40:18.018
Well, and this is where one of
his conceptual innovations comes

00:40:18.018 --> 00:40:18.630
in.
 

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:24.402
He says, "The way to think
about it is from the standpoint

00:40:24.402 --> 00:40:28.405
of the most adversely affected
person,"

00:40:28.405 --> 00:40:33.059
because you don't know who
you're going to be.

00:40:33.059 --> 00:40:37.980
So for any principle if you
could say,

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:42.099
"Well, if I was the most
adversely affected person by

00:40:42.099 --> 00:40:45.550
that principle,
and I would still choose it,

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:49.925
then it starts to look like a
procedural expression of the

00:40:49.925 --> 00:40:54.150
categorical imperative,"
because if the person most

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:58.909
disadvantaged by it would choose
it over the going alternatives

00:40:58.909 --> 00:41:02.750
then presumably everybody else
would, okay?

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:06.646
And so this is a
misunderstanding of Rawls that

00:41:06.646 --> 00:41:08.679
people often get into.
 

00:41:08.679 --> 00:41:12.856
He says at one point,
"If the standpoint of

00:41:12.856 --> 00:41:18.365
justice is the standpoint of the
least advantaged person,"

00:41:18.365 --> 00:41:23.610
but this is not a kind of
bleeding heart liberal point.

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:27.293
He's not saying the standpoint
of justice is the standpoint of

00:41:27.293 --> 00:41:30.856
the least advantaged person
because we should feel sorry for

00:41:30.856 --> 00:41:32.789
the least advantaged person.
 

00:41:32.789 --> 00:41:35.849
That poor bag lady and that
rich Trump, isn't that

00:41:35.849 --> 00:41:37.599
disgusting to contemplate?
 

00:41:37.599 --> 00:41:39.349
That's not his point.
 

00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:43.856
It's a self-interested point,
a completely self-interested

00:41:43.856 --> 00:41:44.489
point.
 

00:41:44.489 --> 00:41:47.353
He's saying,
"You figure out what you

00:41:47.353 --> 00:41:51.474
would choose in this situation
of turning out to be the most

00:41:51.474 --> 00:41:53.219
disadvantaged person.
 

00:41:53.219 --> 00:41:57.166
That is the standpoint of
justice, not because we feel

00:41:57.166 --> 00:42:00.369
badly for the most disadvantaged
person,

00:42:00.369 --> 00:42:03.902
but because we want a
universalizable principle,"

00:42:03.902 --> 00:42:04.369
okay?
 

00:42:04.369 --> 00:42:05.880
That's the point.
 

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:12.769
As I said, it's not a bleeding
heart point.

00:42:12.769 --> 00:42:15.000
It's a self-interest point.
 

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.159
It's self-interest in the
service of universalizability.

00:42:19.159 --> 00:42:25.097
It's to get people to pick a
principle that they would affirm

00:42:25.097 --> 00:42:29.452
no matter what,
and that's the sense in which

00:42:29.452 --> 00:42:33.510
Rawls thinks of himself as a
Kantian.

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:39.170
Okay, now let's come back to
religious freedom.

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:45.981
Well, if we had an established
church and you turned out to be

00:42:45.981 --> 00:42:52.570
a member of the established
religion you would be completely

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:55.320
happy,
but if we had an established

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.980
church and you turned out to be
a non-believer,

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.090
or a believer in a different
religion,

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:02.900
you wouldn't be happy, right?
 

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:06.304
You'd be less happy,
at least, than the person who

00:43:06.304 --> 00:43:09.780
turns out to belong to the
established religion.

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:15.159
That part's straightforward,
but that's not the interesting

00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:19.889
comparison, it's not the
illuminating comparison.

00:43:19.889 --> 00:43:23.969
So Rawls says,
"Think about it like this.

00:43:23.969 --> 00:43:27.639
 
 

00:43:27.639 --> 00:43:31.380
The question is whether or not
to have an established church,

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:33.440
an established religion,
right?

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:39.579
So think about the person who
is not a member of the

00:43:39.579 --> 00:43:47.161
established religion in a world
in which there is an established

00:43:47.161 --> 00:43:49.570
religion, right?
 

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:56.177
Versus the believer in a world
in which there is no established

00:43:56.177 --> 00:43:57.989
religion."
 

00:43:57.989 --> 00:44:03.789
Suppose you're an atheist,
and you have no established

00:44:03.789 --> 00:44:09.041
religion, you're happy,
but on the other hand the

00:44:09.041 --> 00:44:13.090
fundamentalist is unhappy,
right?

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:19.231
But so for Rawls the relevant
comparison is would you rather

00:44:19.231 --> 00:44:25.373
be a fundamentalist in a regime
where there's no established

00:44:25.373 --> 00:44:31.099
religion or a non-believer in a
regime where there is an

00:44:31.099 --> 00:44:33.909
established religion?
 

00:44:33.909 --> 00:44:38.353
And his argument for
disestablished religion is that

00:44:38.353 --> 00:44:42.797
the believer in the
disestablishment regime has more

00:44:42.797 --> 00:44:47.677
religious freedom than the
nonbeliever in the established

00:44:47.677 --> 00:44:49.420
regime, right?
 

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:53.456
To make this concrete,
fundamentalists have more

00:44:53.456 --> 00:44:58.612
religious freedom in America
than non-fundamentalists have in

00:44:58.612 --> 00:45:00.760
Saudi Arabia or Iran.
 

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:06.018
So the reason to prefer
disestablishment of religion is

00:45:06.018 --> 00:45:11.275
that if you're trying to
maximize the religious freedom

00:45:11.275 --> 00:45:17.019
of the least advantaged person
you have to look at the least

00:45:17.019 --> 00:45:22.862
advantaged person in all of the
possible regimes of governing

00:45:22.862 --> 00:45:25.199
religion, right?
 

00:45:25.199 --> 00:45:29.273
And so the defense of the
establishment clause of the

00:45:29.273 --> 00:45:33.739
U.S.--he doesn't talk about this
example, it's my example,

00:45:33.739 --> 00:45:36.090
but it's his logic,
right?

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:39.943
If you said the Rawlsian
defense of the establishment

00:45:39.943 --> 00:45:43.056
clause of the
U.S. Constitution that's what

00:45:43.056 --> 00:45:44.389
it would be.
 

00:45:44.389 --> 00:45:48.871
Christian fundamentalists often
criticize the establishment

00:45:48.871 --> 00:45:53.199
clause, particularly the way
it's been interpreted by the

00:45:53.199 --> 00:45:54.050
courts.
 

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:57.800
They say it's presented as
neutral among religions and it's

00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:58.190
not.
 

00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:01.590
It's not neutral because it
works,

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:04.541
you know, people who think
there shouldn't be an

00:46:04.541 --> 00:46:07.690
established religion,
get exactly what they want,

00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:09.820
but we who think there should
be,

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:12.690
don't get exactly what we want,
so it's not neutral.

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:16.719
Correct, they're correct,
it's not neutral.

00:46:16.719 --> 00:46:21.039
And Rawls actually contributes
to confusion here because

00:46:21.039 --> 00:46:24.889
sometimes he talks about his
theory as neutral.

00:46:24.889 --> 00:46:28.449
It's not neutral.
 

00:46:28.449 --> 00:46:32.860
And the requirement is not that
it should be neutral,

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:37.771
but rather that it should give
the most extensive religious

00:46:37.771 --> 00:46:43.360
freedom to the person who's most
disadvantaged in either system.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:47.380
So as I said,
the key point is that the

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:53.304
believer has more religious
freedom if you have something

00:46:53.304 --> 00:46:59.654
like the U.S.'s establishment
clause than the nonbeliever has

00:46:59.654 --> 00:47:04.309
when you have a fundamentalist
regime.

00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:06.449
That's the claim.
 

00:47:06.449 --> 00:47:10.820
And so you want to give the
most extensive system of

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:15.532
religious freedom compatible
with a like system for all,

00:47:15.532 --> 00:47:16.389
right?
 

00:47:16.389 --> 00:47:19.766
And the way you get to
compatible with a like system

00:47:19.766 --> 00:47:23.407
for all is to look at it from
the standpoint of the most

00:47:23.407 --> 00:47:28.152
adversely affected person,
or the least advantaged person

00:47:28.152 --> 00:47:29.320
in any case.
 

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:33.719
So that's the basic way in
which he reasons.

00:47:33.719 --> 00:47:39.048
And that's why this sort of
rather empty-sounding phrase

00:47:39.048 --> 00:47:45.056
here that is his first principle
actually has more content than

00:47:45.056 --> 00:47:49.706
might appear to be at first
sight to be the case,

00:47:49.706 --> 00:47:50.869
right?
 

00:47:50.869 --> 00:47:54.983
So it's the standpoint of
justice is the standpoint of the

00:47:54.983 --> 00:47:59.025
most disadvantaged person not
because of being a bleeding

00:47:59.025 --> 00:48:01.367
heart,
but because you want a

00:48:01.367 --> 00:48:03.269
universalizable principle.
 

00:48:03.269 --> 00:48:05.440
And it's just the cake cutting.
 

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:10.211
You're giving the knife to the
person who's getting the last

00:48:10.211 --> 00:48:10.860
slice.
 

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:16.041
You say, "Pick the system
that will give you the most

00:48:16.041 --> 00:48:21.769
religious freedom when you later
discover what your beliefs are,

00:48:21.769 --> 00:48:22.679
right?
 

00:48:22.679 --> 00:48:26.199
And that is the principle you
should affirm."

00:48:26.199 --> 00:48:32.650
And that is why a religious
fundamentalist should choose the

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:36.369
establishment clause of the U.S.
 

00:48:36.369 --> 00:48:40.286
Okay, now somebody might come
along with some other principle

00:48:40.286 --> 00:48:44.463
and show that it does better and
then we'd have to go through the

00:48:44.463 --> 00:48:45.639
process again.
 

00:48:45.639 --> 00:48:49.719
But so that's the basic
structure of Rawlsian reasoning,

00:48:49.719 --> 00:48:52.909
if you like,
about principles of justice.

00:48:52.909 --> 00:48:58.230
Okay, we'll pause there and
pick up on Wednesday.

00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:04.000

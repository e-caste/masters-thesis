00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.600
Prof: I think I'm going
to start.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.864
So this is really the beginning
of the finance part of the

00:00:07.864 --> 00:00:08.380
course.
 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.571
So far we've reviewed general
equilibrium, which I said Fisher

00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:15.870
invented or reinvented in order
to do finance.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.835
And as you remember the main
conclusions from general

00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:26.373
equilibrium are first that the
market functioning by itself

00:00:26.373 --> 00:00:30.480
without interference from the
outside,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.390
in other words a situation of
laissez-faire,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.010
leads to allocations that are
Pareto efficient.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.853
So they're in some sense good
for the economy and good for the

00:00:38.853 --> 00:00:39.320
society.
 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.750
They don't maximize total
welfare.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.401
That's not even a well-defined
thing as we saw last time

00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:47.101
because how can you measure,
how can you add one person's

00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:48.210
utility to another.
 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.530
It doesn't even make sense.
 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.288
So economists at first were
wrong to think of that as the

00:00:53.288 --> 00:00:57.407
criterion for good allocations,
but there's another better

00:00:57.407 --> 00:01:00.798
definition of efficiency that
Pareto invented,

00:01:00.798 --> 00:01:04.221
called Pareto Efficiency,
and the free market achieves

00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:08.030
Pareto Efficiency at least if
there are no externalities and

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.578
there's no monopoly.
 

00:01:09.578 --> 00:01:12.650
So that, lesson number one,
was taken to mean that the

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.718
government shouldn't interfere
in the free market,

00:01:15.718 --> 00:01:18.040
especially shouldn't interfere
in financial markets,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.920
and that's something we're
going to come to examine.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.631
The second lesson we found was
that the price is determined by

00:01:25.631 --> 00:01:27.409
marginal utility.
 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.860
It's not determined by total
utility.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.849
So it may be that water is much
more valuable than diamonds

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:36.048
because it does a lot more good
for everybody and for the world

00:01:36.048 --> 00:01:39.218
as a whole than diamonds do,
but the last drop of water,

00:01:39.218 --> 00:01:42.099
really most people have as much
water as they need,

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:45.227
the last drop of water is not
doing that much whereas the last

00:01:45.227 --> 00:01:48.099
diamond is a rare thing and not
many people have them.

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:51.318
So the last drop of water is
worth less than the last equal

00:01:51.318 --> 00:01:54.537
weight of diamonds and therefore
water is much cheaper than

00:01:54.537 --> 00:01:57.700
diamonds even though water's
much more valuable as a whole

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.810
than diamonds.
 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.920
The price of things depends on
their marginal utility.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.168
A third implication of what we
did is that there's no such

00:02:10.168 --> 00:02:13.218
thing as a just price.
 

00:02:13.218 --> 00:02:16.222
It depends on what peoples'
utilities are and how much they

00:02:16.222 --> 00:02:16.740
like it.
 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.628
It depends on how much of the
good there is.

00:02:18.628 --> 00:02:20.081
That's why diamonds are priced
less than water [correction:

00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:21.310
that's why water is priced less
than diamonds].

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.620
And it depends on how wealthy
people are.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.022
If you transfer money from
people who don't like apples

00:02:29.022 --> 00:02:32.673
compared to tomatoes,
to people who like apples a lot

00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:35.321
compared to tomatoes,
the price in the free market is

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.149
going to reflect more the latter
class of people than the former

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:40.080
because they've got the money to
spend,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.931
and so the price of apples is
going to go up relative to the

00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:43.900
price of tomatoes.
 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.318
So those are the three basic
lessons of general equilibrium.

00:02:47.318 --> 00:02:50.306
The first one about
laissez-faire has a huge

00:02:50.306 --> 00:02:54.060
implication for whether there
should be regulation,

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.770
but the second pair of
implications,

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.882
what determines the price and
how price changes as you

00:02:59.882 --> 00:03:02.667
redistribute wealth and so on,
and no just price,

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:05.253
that set of ideas,
you'll see, is also going to be

00:03:05.253 --> 00:03:06.740
very important for finance.
 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.438
So those lessons seem clear.
 

00:03:10.438 --> 00:03:13.158
Some of those lessons were
understood already by Aristotle

00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:13.780
as we said.
 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.800
So the ancients understood
supply and demand,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.938
at least a little bit of supply
and demand,

00:03:17.938 --> 00:03:21.798
and yet as soon as they moved
from apples and oranges to

00:03:21.798 --> 00:03:24.131
finance,
they all got hopelessly

00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:24.810
confused.
 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.257
So Aristotle said,
"Interest is

00:03:28.257 --> 00:03:30.030
unnatural."
 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.889
I could go through a lot of
people and what they said,

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.750
but I'm going to just leave it
at a few quotations.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.030
The Bible says interest is
terrible.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.819
Judaism frowns on interest.
 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.539
Christianity frowns on interest.
 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:47.520
Islam frowns on interest.
 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.378
All the great religions of the
world crystallizing,

00:03:50.378 --> 00:03:52.840
obviously, some of the most
important thinking of the time,

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.410
frowns on interest,
so just to remind you of a few.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.090
So why do they frown on
interest?

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.580
Well, the idea is that you do
nothing, the lender does nothing

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.500
and he gets back more than he
lent to begin with.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.265
He's making a profit without
having exerted any effort

00:04:12.265 --> 00:04:13.188
whatsoever.
 

00:04:13.188 --> 00:04:16.677
So, Sulinay Middleton said,
"In trade both parties are

00:04:16.677 --> 00:04:19.829
expected to gain,
whereas in lending at usury

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.430
only the usurer could
profit."

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.019
So in Deuteronomy in the Bible,
so this is the Jewish Bible,

00:04:28.019 --> 00:04:29.942
is says, "Thou shalt not
lend on usury,"

00:04:29.942 --> 00:04:31.079
(that just means interest).
 

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:33.779
"Thou shalt not lend on
usury to thy brother.

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:35.928
Usury of money,
usury of victuals,

00:04:35.928 --> 00:04:39.833
usury of anything that is lent
upon usury, "--that's all

00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:40.680
terrible.
 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.237
Of course, "unto a
foreigner thou mayest lend upon

00:04:44.237 --> 00:04:48.519
usury, but unto a brother thou
shalt not lend upon usury."

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:51.398
So the Jews could lend to
Christians but not to each

00:04:51.398 --> 00:04:51.850
other.
 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.997
So the Christian Church
outlawed usury,

00:04:54.997 --> 00:04:57.069
called it a mortal sin.
 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:00.110
Luther, for example,
says, "For who so lends

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.036
that he wants it back better or
more, that is open and damnable

00:05:04.036 --> 00:05:04.670
ocker.
 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.105
Those who do that are all
daylight robbers,

00:05:07.105 --> 00:05:08.439
thieves and ockerers.
 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:12.449
Those are little Jewish arts
and tricks."

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.310
So there was this antipathy
towards usury,

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.738
and because Jewish moneylenders
were able to lend to Christians

00:05:20.738 --> 00:05:24.165
there was an antipathy to Jewish
moneylenders which we're going

00:05:24.165 --> 00:05:26.709
to come to when we talk about
Shakespeare.

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:29.790
So Muslims also forbid lending.
 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.254
In fact, even today it's
illegal to charge interest in

00:05:33.254 --> 00:05:34.170
Islamic law.
 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.709
So in my hedge fund we tried to
raise money,

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:39.110
and there's lots of money in
the Middle East,

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.779
and most of it,
by the way, ten years ago,

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:45.009
almost all Middle Eastern money
was invested in U.S.

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:46.269
Government bonds and U.S.
 

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:49.829
stocks, nothing else like in
mortgages, for instance.

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:54.185
So I went to Saudi Arabia and I
met a bunch of brothers of the

00:05:54.185 --> 00:05:58.327
King, the eldest brothers of the
King, and I suggested they

00:05:58.327 --> 00:06:00.399
invest in our hedge fund.
 

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:02.992
And they actually became sort
of interested,

00:06:02.992 --> 00:06:06.069
and so we had to write up a
complicated contract.

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:07.889
Now, you know a mortgage pays
interest,

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:10.927
so if you invest in the hedge
fund and the mortgage is paying

00:06:10.927 --> 00:06:13.509
interest it looks like they're
getting interest,

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:15.300
and so that wasn't going to do.
 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.293
So we had to write a very
elaborate contract which

00:06:18.293 --> 00:06:21.410
disguised the fact that interest
was being paid,

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.771
and it had to be overseen and
blessed according to Sharia Law

00:06:25.771 --> 00:06:29.915
by a holy person who was going
to verify that there was no

00:06:29.915 --> 00:06:30.860
interest.
 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.692
Now he charged a fee which was
a percent a year which looked an

00:06:35.692 --> 00:06:38.889
awful lot like interest,
but anyway so.

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:42.658
So the point is all these
religions have banished interest

00:06:42.658 --> 00:06:46.163
despite the fact that they
themselves were involved in

00:06:46.163 --> 00:06:50.050
interest,
and lending, and borrowing.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.891
A world can't function really
without lending and borrowing

00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:57.480
and the charging of interest.
 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.072
So these religions that forbade
it at the same time knew that it

00:07:01.072 --> 00:07:04.608
was going on and allowed it to
go on and sometimes participated

00:07:04.608 --> 00:07:05.180
in it.
 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.783
But the point I'm trying to
make is that there was vast

00:07:07.783 --> 00:07:09.713
confusion,
and even today there's

00:07:09.713 --> 00:07:13.329
confusion because still today
the Jewish law doesn't allow for

00:07:13.329 --> 00:07:16.528
interest between Jews,
and--there's a charade that

00:07:16.528 --> 00:07:19.600
goes on there just like there is
in Islamic law,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.867
and just like there is--still
frowned upon by the Christian

00:07:23.867 --> 00:07:24.528
Church.
 

00:07:24.528 --> 00:07:28.689
So it's a hard subject to
understand, and why is that?

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:31.242
Why is it that it's so
confusing, and how should we

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:32.060
understand it?
 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.899
Well, Fisher cut through all
this extremely simply,

00:07:36.899 --> 00:07:40.214
and the way he did it was he
said, "Let's just think

00:07:40.214 --> 00:07:43.471
mathematically then we won't get
so tied up in all these

00:07:43.471 --> 00:07:45.069
religious complexities.
 

00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:48.269
Just let's do something
mathematical and concrete."

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:52.036
So suppose that we consider a
problem, which is the one I'm

00:07:52.036 --> 00:07:54.829
going to work with the rest of
the class.

00:07:54.829 --> 00:07:56.959
Maybe I better do it over here.
 

00:07:56.959 --> 00:08:03.509
So let's say that there are two
agents and two goods.

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:06.069
So the two goods now are
X_1 and X_2.

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:08.624
So Fisher's first insight is
that let's think of

00:08:08.624 --> 00:08:11.069
X_1 and X_2
as apples,

00:08:11.069 --> 00:08:13.920
but apples today and apples
next year,

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.829
Fisher said--although they're
both apples,

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.314
exactly alike,
there's no difference between

00:08:18.314 --> 00:08:20.557
these apples,
the apples this year are

00:08:20.557 --> 00:08:22.920
different goods from the apples
next year.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.384
So let's move away from apples
and tomatoes to apples this year

00:08:26.384 --> 00:08:27.670
and apples next year.
 

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.600
So I'm not going to call them
goods X and Y anymore.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.639
I'm going to subscript them by
time.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.494
These are both X because it's
the same good,

00:08:36.494 --> 00:08:38.995
but they're different goods
because they occur at different

00:08:38.995 --> 00:08:39.730
time periods.
 

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.953
So Fisher said we can
incorporate time simply by

00:08:42.953 --> 00:08:44.668
having different goods.
 

00:08:44.668 --> 00:08:48.144
So of course people,
he said, are going to have some

00:08:48.144 --> 00:08:51.960
utility of consuming today
versus consuming tomorrow,

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:57.284
and let's say this utility is
(log X_1) (1 half log

00:08:57.284 --> 00:08:59.860
X_2) for Mr. A.
 

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.379
So I'm going to come back to
this in half an hour and explain

00:09:04.379 --> 00:09:07.918
why Fisher thought that this
half made sense.

00:09:07.918 --> 00:09:14.080
You see, this Agent A likes
good 1 a lot more than good 2.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.769
So Fisher would say that's
because Agent A is inpatient.

00:09:17.769 --> 00:09:20.186
An apple is an apple,
but if you get it now it's

00:09:20.186 --> 00:09:22.499
worth more to you,
it gives you higher utility

00:09:22.499 --> 00:09:24.350
than getting an apple next year.
 

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:25.929
"This is a law of human
nature,"

00:09:25.929 --> 00:09:27.756
he claimed,
which I'm going to come back to

00:09:27.756 --> 00:09:30.174
later,
and that's why when you write

00:09:30.174 --> 00:09:34.058
down the utility function
there's a discount factor,

00:09:34.058 --> 00:09:38.450
which we're going to add--a
discount factor--

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.014
which discounts,
reduces, the utility you get

00:09:41.014 --> 00:09:42.529
from future consumption.
 

00:09:42.529 --> 00:09:49.375
So let's say (U^(B) of
X_1 and X_2)

00:09:49.375 --> 00:09:54.700
= (log X_1 log
X_2).

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.279
So B is more patient than A is.
 

00:09:58.279 --> 00:10:00.620
B actually doesn't discount the
future.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:01.980
A does discount the future.
 

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:09.773
So A is impatient,
relatively impatient,

00:10:09.773 --> 00:10:13.570
and B is patient.
 

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:19.052
They have endowments,
so E^(A) let's say the

00:10:19.052 --> 00:10:21.730
endowment is (1,0).
 

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:28.908
Say it is (1,1) and E^(B) let's
make that (1,0).

00:10:28.908 --> 00:10:31.714
But now Fisher wants to talk
about finance and he wants to

00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:34.125
talk about stocks,
and bonds, and interest and all

00:10:34.125 --> 00:10:35.110
kinds of things.
 

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:38.980
So he says, "We've talked
about good with no problem.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.774
We can talk about goods today
and next year with no problem,

00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:43.289
let's talk about stocks."
 

00:10:43.289 --> 00:10:44.190
What is a stock?
 

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:50.909
Let's say there are two stocks,
stock alpha and stock beta.

00:10:50.909 --> 00:10:53.379
What are stocks?
 

00:10:53.379 --> 00:10:55.740
I mean, they're pieces of paper
that you're trading,

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.895
but they give you ownership of
something like a factory or a

00:10:58.895 --> 00:11:02.038
company or something,
and what good is the company?

00:11:02.038 --> 00:11:04.096
Well the good of the company is
that it's going to produce

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:04.528
something.
 

00:11:04.528 --> 00:11:08.044
So let's say that the stock is
going to produce something in

00:11:08.044 --> 00:11:08.820
the future.
 

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:13.910
So we'll call the production of
the stock--so what is the

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:14.730
future?
 

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.149
There are only apples in the
future.

00:11:17.149 --> 00:11:23.498
So let's say
D^(alpha)_2 is 1 and

00:11:23.498 --> 00:11:27.580
D^(beta)_2 = 2.
 

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.356
Fisher says,
you can tell a lot of stories

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:33.773
about what this stock does,
and what its method of

00:11:33.773 --> 00:11:36.522
production is,
and what kind of managers it

00:11:36.522 --> 00:11:38.700
has and a lot of stuff like
that,

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.344
but in the end people care
about the stock because the

00:11:41.344 --> 00:11:43.288
stock is going to produce
something,

00:11:43.288 --> 00:11:45.831
and the value of the stock is
going to come from what it

00:11:45.831 --> 00:11:46.340
produces.
 

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.081
So D^(alpha)_2 is
what people expect the output of

00:11:50.081 --> 00:11:54.011
the stock to be next year which
is the last year we're worrying

00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:56.121
about,
and D^(beta)_2 which

00:11:56.121 --> 00:11:58.899
is 2 is what people expect the
stock to produce next year.

00:11:58.899 --> 00:12:03.970
And we're going to assume that
perfect foresight here.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.495
So Fisher says, "Well,
in general people's

00:12:06.495 --> 00:12:09.356
expectations might be
wrong," but let's start off

00:12:09.356 --> 00:12:11.639
with the case--
people anticipate something,

00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:14.583
surely they're looking ahead to
the future when deciding whether

00:12:14.583 --> 00:12:15.519
to buy the stock.
 

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:17.769
We've got to assume something
about what they think.

00:12:17.769 --> 00:12:20.667
Let's suppose they actually get
it right and they know what the

00:12:20.667 --> 00:12:22.350
price of the stock is next
period.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:29.220
So what's going to happen?
 

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.331
Well, we can define an economy
and presumably the interest rate

00:12:33.331 --> 00:12:37.178
and the stock prices and all
that are going to come out.

00:12:37.178 --> 00:12:39.537
Now I should mention,
by the way, I forgot to say

00:12:39.537 --> 00:12:42.482
this, but as I write this down I
suddenly realize I forgot to

00:12:42.482 --> 00:12:43.220
mention it.
 

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.908
There are other theories of
interest too.

00:12:45.908 --> 00:12:50.779
Another famous one was Marx's
Theory of Interest.

00:12:50.779 --> 00:12:53.220
So this is to be contrasted
with Fisher.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.330
What did Marx say?
 

00:12:55.330 --> 00:13:03.378
So in my youth when I was your
age it was very fashionable to

00:13:03.378 --> 00:13:05.389
be a Marxist.
 

00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:07.120
You had to study Marxism
basically.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.548
If you wanted to talk to women
you had to know about Marx.

00:13:09.548 --> 00:13:14.100
So anyhow, I dutifully went off
and read Marx.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.928
And so what's the idea of Marx?
 

00:13:15.928 --> 00:13:20.559
The idea was that he imagined
an agricultural economy where

00:13:20.559 --> 00:13:25.590
you plant stuff today and then
the output comes out tomorrow.

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:29.470
So you put corn in today,
corn comes out tomorrow.

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:34.129
So it doesn't require much
effort to plant the corn.

00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:35.178
You have to buy the corn.
 

00:13:35.178 --> 00:13:38.405
So the capitalists would buy
the corn, but planting it didn't

00:13:38.405 --> 00:13:39.590
require much effort.
 

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.592
However, harvesting it,
picking the cotton,

00:13:42.592 --> 00:13:46.312
picking the chocolate,
picking all that stuff takes a

00:13:46.312 --> 00:13:47.600
lot of effort.
 

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.168
So in the end you'd get a lot
of output.

00:13:50.168 --> 00:13:53.751
Now when you pick the output
you'd have to pay workers in

00:13:53.751 --> 00:13:55.480
order to pick the output.
 

00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:03.057
So Marx imagined that there was
a wage that was arrived at by

00:14:03.057 --> 00:14:06.003
the struggle,
class struggle,

00:14:06.003 --> 00:14:09.636
between the capitalists and the
workers over the subsistence

00:14:09.636 --> 00:14:10.129
wage.
 

00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:15.986
So the subsistence wage was
something that resulted from

00:14:15.986 --> 00:14:21.346
this huge class struggle,
and over time maybe it would

00:14:21.346 --> 00:14:25.399
rise as workers got stronger,
but it was still always quite

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:28.389
low and the subsistence wage was
what the workers would get.

00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:31.731
And what's left over,
which was the surplus--so the

00:14:31.731 --> 00:14:35.610
output being more than what was
put in, was the surplus.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.370
Part of the surplus would go to
the subsistence wage.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.970
The rest would go to profit.
 

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:44.860
And so if you look at how much
was put in to begin with,

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.582
you get all the output back
out, the same amount of corn you

00:14:47.582 --> 00:14:50.259
put in plus some extra you have
to give to the workers,

00:14:50.259 --> 00:14:55.519
and extra that the capitalist
gets back as his profit.

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:58.320
The fact that the capitalist
has done no work at all,

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.629
he's just bought the corn,
let someone else plant it,

00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:02.989
let someone else harvest,
paid all those guys virtually

00:15:02.989 --> 00:15:05.129
nothing at the beginning and a
lot at the end,

00:15:05.129 --> 00:15:07.811
he's gotten profit for doing
nothing just like when you lend

00:15:07.811 --> 00:15:12.812
money,
so the profit divided by the

00:15:12.812 --> 00:15:19.870
initial outlay,
that was the rate of interest.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.799
And so Marx said that a
capitalist, he could put his

00:15:22.799 --> 00:15:26.133
money in his bank or he could
run this farm and make profit

00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:26.879
this way.
 

00:15:26.879 --> 00:15:28.677
So the money,
interest in the bank would have

00:15:28.677 --> 00:15:31.046
to turn out to be the same as
this rate of profit otherwise

00:15:31.046 --> 00:15:32.639
he'd put all the money in the
bank.

00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:35.634
And if it was smaller the banks
would have to give higher

00:15:35.634 --> 00:15:37.879
interest in order to attract
depositors.

00:15:37.879 --> 00:15:40.376
So the capitalist's
profit--rate of interest was

00:15:40.376 --> 00:15:43.460
determined by the rate of profit
and the rate of profit was

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.490
determined by the struggle
between capital and labor.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.422
So we've got these religious
figures and great philosophers

00:15:49.422 --> 00:15:50.940
saying interest is terrible.
 

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.610
We've got this great
philosopher-economist saying

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.779
it's the result of a class
struggle,

00:15:55.779 --> 00:15:58.403
and now we've got Fisher,
actually Marx was pretty

00:15:58.403 --> 00:16:00.471
mathematical,
but now we've got Fisher

00:16:00.471 --> 00:16:03.048
turning it into a simple math
problem and saying,

00:16:03.048 --> 00:16:05.469
"Let's reason out the math
problem and we'll have the

00:16:05.469 --> 00:16:07.719
answer to these questions,
and it'll turn out to be quite

00:16:07.719 --> 00:16:09.519
different from what all these
guys are saying."

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:14.808
So here's his economy that I
just described.

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:17.881
The Fisher example,
not literally an example he

00:16:17.881 --> 00:16:20.220
gave, but similar to one he
gave.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.908
So he said, "All right,
what happens in this economy?

00:16:22.908 --> 00:16:24.808
Let's just be very
commonsensical.

00:16:24.808 --> 00:16:31.720
What we need to find out now is
financial equilibrium,"

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:38.279
so financial equilibrium is
much more complicated seeming

00:16:38.279 --> 00:16:42.870
than we had before,
because we care about the

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:43.440
prices.
 

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:48.073
So now I'm going to use (q) for
prices, a q for contemporary

00:16:48.073 --> 00:16:50.587
prices,
q_contemporary,

00:16:50.587 --> 00:16:54.830
so the price you pay today to
get the apple today.

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.863
q_2 is the price you
pay next year to get the apple

00:16:57.863 --> 00:16:58.470
next year.
 

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:03.190
They're contemporary prices.
 

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.740
And of course people are going
to decide what they want to do,

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.344
X^(A)_1,
what they're going to end up

00:17:08.344 --> 00:17:11.164
consuming X^(A)_2,
X^(B)_1,

00:17:11.164 --> 00:17:14.431
X^(B)_2,
but now we've got a more

00:17:14.431 --> 00:17:16.078
complicated world.
 

00:17:16.078 --> 00:17:21.440
There's stocks to be traded and
there's the price of stocks.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.500
So P--pi_alpha,
I'm running out of letters.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.828
I'm going to switch to a Greek
one.

00:17:26.828 --> 00:17:33.808
This is the price of stock A,
stock alpha.

00:17:33.808 --> 00:17:39.410
And pi_beta is the
price of stock beta.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:43.640
And then we have to know how
many shares are they going to

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.160
hold?
 

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.724
Well, it's going be theta^(A),
A's going to hold a certain

00:17:47.724 --> 00:17:50.440
number of shares of alpha,
and theta^(A)_beta,

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:54.450
A's going to hold a certain
number of shares of stock beta,

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.849
and B's going to hold a certain
number of shares of alpha and a

00:17:57.849 --> 00:17:59.769
certain number of shares of
beta.

00:17:59.769 --> 00:18:02.400
So we want to solve for all of
that.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.648
Now, I should have said at the
beginning if these are trees

00:18:06.648 --> 00:18:10.019
producing apples there was an
initial stock.

00:18:10.019 --> 00:18:11.858
People owned a certain number
of trees.

00:18:11.858 --> 00:18:17.859
So let's say
theta-bar_alpha^(A),

00:18:17.859 --> 00:18:24.288
so this is the original
ownership of alpha.

00:18:24.288 --> 00:18:26.509
Let's just say that's,
I'll make up some number.

00:18:26.509 --> 00:18:28.920
I might as well use the same
number I thought of before.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.320
Let's say that's 1,
and let's say

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.358
theta-bar^(B)_alpha is
0,

00:18:36.358 --> 00:18:41.848
and let's say theta-bar^(A) of
beta is a half,

00:18:41.848 --> 00:18:47.259
and theta-bar^(B) of beta is a
half.

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:52.570
So the original economy is more
complicated than before because

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.369
we've added stocks.
 

00:18:54.369 --> 00:18:55.838
We characterized the stock.
 

00:18:55.838 --> 00:18:58.058
We said a stock is a very
complicated thing.

00:18:58.058 --> 00:19:01.000
A company is very complicated,
depends on managers and

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.329
processes and there's all kinds
of stuff you think about when

00:19:04.329 --> 00:19:07.742
you think about a stock,
but really at heart all people

00:19:07.742 --> 00:19:11.410
are trying to do is forecast
what are they going to produce.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:14.440
And so we're going to make it
simple mathematically and say

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.680
let's say we know what they're
going to produce next period.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.568
So let's say it's a tree.
 

00:19:18.568 --> 00:19:20.769
Everybody knows the alpha
tree's producing 1 apple.

00:19:20.769 --> 00:19:23.588
The beta tree's producing two
apples.

00:19:23.588 --> 00:19:30.608
Alpha happens to own the only
alpha tree.

00:19:30.608 --> 00:19:34.794
A owns the alpha tree,
excuse me, and A and B own half

00:19:34.794 --> 00:19:36.690
each of the beta tree.
 

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.258
So that's the original economy
and the equilibrium is going to

00:19:40.258 --> 00:19:42.040
be,
what are the prices going to

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.700
turn out to be of X_1
and X_2,

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.740
what are the prices of the
trees going to turn out to be,

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.348
how much will people consume
and how many shares?

00:19:51.348 --> 00:19:55.057
Because alpha A began with all
of tree maybe he'll sell his

00:19:55.057 --> 00:19:59.019
shares of tree and end up with
not having a tree in the end.

00:19:59.019 --> 00:20:01.739
So we have to see where they
began, the stock ownership to

00:20:01.739 --> 00:20:03.410
begin with and where they end
up.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.778
So we have to solve all of that
and it looks way more

00:20:05.778 --> 00:20:08.861
complicated than before,
and so complicated that you can

00:20:08.861 --> 00:20:11.430
see why people might have gotten
confused.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.309
But according to Fisher it's
going to turn out to be a very

00:20:14.309 --> 00:20:17.338
simple problem in the end once
we look at it the right way.

00:20:17.338 --> 00:20:21.703
So are there any questions
about what the economy is and

00:20:21.703 --> 00:20:25.990
what are the variables that
we're trying to explain?

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.710
Yeah?
 

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:29.894
Student: Sorry,
I can't read what that says

00:20:29.894 --> 00:20:31.259
over theta alpha A.
 

00:20:31.259 --> 00:20:32.538
That's original ownership?
 

00:20:32.538 --> 00:20:35.910
Prof: Original ownership
of stock alpha.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.818
And this is original ownership
by B of stock alpha.

00:20:38.818 --> 00:20:44.230
This original ownership by A of
stock beta, and this is the

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:49.736
original ownership by B of stock
beta, original ownership of

00:20:49.736 --> 00:20:50.670
alpha.
 

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:51.170
Thanks.
 

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:52.380
Yes?
 

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.675
Student: Having defined
all of these could you redefine

00:20:54.675 --> 00:20:55.430
what D stands for?
 

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:56.680
Prof: D is the dividend.
 

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.440
That's the output that we can
all--thank you.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.920
I should just write this down.
 

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:10.460
This is the anticipated
dividend, which is the output

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:20.919
since that's the end of the
world of stock alpha in period

00:21:20.919 --> 00:21:22.019
2.
 

00:21:22.019 --> 00:21:26.501
And D^(beta) of 2 is the
anticipated dividend of stock

00:21:26.501 --> 00:21:28.108
beta in period 2.
 

00:21:28.108 --> 00:21:31.017
So it's 1 apple we're getting
out of the alpha tree,

00:21:31.017 --> 00:21:33.240
2 apples out of the beta tree,
right?

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.848
That's what the tree's good for.
 

00:21:34.848 --> 00:21:36.420
We can look at how beautiful it
is.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.999
We could talk about how much
the owner's actually watering

00:21:39.999 --> 00:21:40.690
the tree.
 

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:42.534
We can talk about a lot of
complicated stuff,

00:21:42.534 --> 00:21:44.756
but in the end all we care
about is how many apples we

00:21:44.756 --> 00:21:45.930
expect to get out of it.
 

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.863
All the other stuff goes into
helping us think about how many

00:21:48.863 --> 00:21:51.259
apples we're going to get out of
it in the end.

00:21:51.259 --> 00:21:52.990
So we cut to the bottom line.
 

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.359
What are the apples we expect
to get out of tree,

00:21:56.359 --> 00:21:59.589
1 from the alpha tree,
2 from the beta tree.

00:21:59.589 --> 00:22:01.630
Someone else had their hand up.
 

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.710
Student: I had it,
but you answered it.

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:06.990
Prof: Any other
questions about this set up?

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:10.667
So we're returning to first
principles here,

00:22:10.667 --> 00:22:12.548
very simple example.
 

00:22:12.548 --> 00:22:14.977
When there's ever a big
confusion about something

00:22:14.977 --> 00:22:17.759
important it's always good to go
to first principles.

00:22:17.759 --> 00:22:21.230
There was a chess player when I
was young named Mikhail Tal who

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.640
was a world champion for a
little while,

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.561
and he said that every two or
three years he'd go back and

00:22:27.561 --> 00:22:31.140
read his original introductory
textbooks on chess.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.720
So we're going back to the
first principles.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.698
How would you define
equilibrium here for a financial

00:22:36.698 --> 00:22:37.500
equilibrium?
 

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.950
Well, the first thing is just
common sense.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.259
What are people doing?
 

00:22:43.259 --> 00:22:46.769
At time 1 what can they do?
 

00:22:46.769 --> 00:22:52.386
They can spend money,
so I'm going to look at the

00:22:52.386 --> 00:22:58.589
budget set for Agent i,
and i can be A or B so I don't

00:22:58.589 --> 00:23:01.750
have to write it twice.
 

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:07.430
So he's going to say to
himself, let's say A is he and B

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.288
is she, i is he.
 

00:23:09.288 --> 00:23:13.211
He's going to say to
himself--let's say i will say,

00:23:13.211 --> 00:23:17.288
"How much does it cost me
to buy goods?"

00:23:17.288 --> 00:23:20.271
Well, the cost of apples is
q_1 times

00:23:20.271 --> 00:23:21.308
X_1.
 

00:23:21.308 --> 00:23:23.660
That's how many apples I might
end up with.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.058
Now, how much does it cost me
to buy shares?

00:23:26.058 --> 00:23:29.653
It's going to be
pi_alpha times how

00:23:29.653 --> 00:23:33.575
many shares I end up with,
theta_alpha,

00:23:33.575 --> 00:23:38.150
plus (pi_beta times
theta_beta).

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:41.284
So I'm buying goods,
I'm buying alpha shares and I'm

00:23:41.284 --> 00:23:45.032
buying beta shares and this is
how much I have to spend to get

00:23:45.032 --> 00:23:47.000
the holdings I want of each.
 

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.608
Now where did I get the money
to do that?

00:23:49.608 --> 00:23:54.279
I got the money to do that
because I started with my

00:23:54.279 --> 00:23:58.858
endowment of goods which was
E^(i)_1,

00:23:58.858 --> 00:24:01.798
which in this case for A was 1
unit,

00:24:01.798 --> 00:24:05.069
for B was also 1 unit,
and then I also had shares to

00:24:05.069 --> 00:24:06.930
begin with of these stocks.
 

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:09.180
So I had ([pi_alpha
times]

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:12.009
theta-bar_alpha)
(pi_beta

00:24:12.009 --> 00:24:13.940
theta-bar_beta).
 

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.568
In period 1 that's what I had
to do.

00:24:16.568 --> 00:24:20.861
I wanted to buy apples,
shares and I had shares to sell

00:24:20.861 --> 00:24:22.529
and apples to sell.
 

00:24:22.529 --> 00:24:25.390
So that's what i did.
 

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.857
So of course if X_1
is bigger than the number of

00:24:28.857 --> 00:24:32.632
apples i started with that means
i has bought apples because he

00:24:32.632 --> 00:24:35.308
ends up with more than he
started with,

00:24:35.308 --> 00:24:37.500
so that meant he must have been
buying apples.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.234
If theta_alpha is
more than

00:24:39.234 --> 00:24:41.983
theta-bar_alpha it
means that alpha [correction:

00:24:41.983 --> 00:24:43.720
i]
bought shares of stock alpha.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:47.963
Theta_alpha is less
than theta-bar_alpha

00:24:47.963 --> 00:24:50.049
it means alpha [correction:
i]

00:24:50.049 --> 00:24:52.279
sold shares of stock alpha.
 

00:24:52.279 --> 00:24:55.750
All right, now in the second
period what happens?

00:24:55.750 --> 00:25:01.218
Well, in the second period we
have q_2 times

00:25:01.218 --> 00:25:02.868
X_2.
 

00:25:02.868 --> 00:25:05.690
The shares are going to be
worthless in period 2.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:06.720
So no one's going to buy them.
 

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.838
Why are the shares worthless?
 

00:25:07.838 --> 00:25:11.577
Remember that when you buy a
share of stock the dividend

00:25:11.577 --> 00:25:12.528
comes later.
 

00:25:12.528 --> 00:25:14.400
You don't get the dividend
immediately.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.222
So someone buying stock in
period 2, it's too late to get

00:25:17.222 --> 00:25:17.980
the dividend.
 

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.306
It's already gone to the owner
who bought the shares in period

00:25:22.306 --> 00:25:22.588
1.
 

00:25:22.588 --> 00:25:25.223
So the buyer of a stock
[doesn't]

00:25:25.223 --> 00:25:28.930
gets the dividend for a month
or something.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:32.528
So next period's dividend is
still going to go to the buyer

00:25:32.528 --> 00:25:34.866
in period 1,
that's why it's valuable to buy

00:25:34.866 --> 00:25:37.318
shares in period 1 because you
get next year's apple.

00:25:37.318 --> 00:25:41.476
So by next period you can buy
the tree, but the world's coming

00:25:41.476 --> 00:25:42.088
to end.
 

00:25:42.088 --> 00:25:43.578
That tree's not going to do you
any good.

00:25:43.578 --> 00:25:44.980
It doesn't produce any more
apples.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.798
So nobody's going to bother
buying shares.

00:25:46.798 --> 00:25:48.099
I don't have to bother with
them.

00:25:48.099 --> 00:25:49.848
The prices are zero.
 

00:25:49.848 --> 00:25:54.750
And so what income do people
have in period 2?

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.893
Well, they've got the
contemporaneous price times the

00:25:58.893 --> 00:26:03.993
apples that somehow they find on
the ground or that their parents

00:26:03.993 --> 00:26:07.660
are going to leave them when
they get old.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.901
So that's their endowment of
apples, but what else do they

00:26:10.901 --> 00:26:11.298
have?
 

00:26:11.298 --> 00:26:14.019
They've got more apples than
that.

00:26:14.019 --> 00:26:16.269
What else do they have?
 

00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:17.109
Student: The dividends.
 

00:26:17.109 --> 00:26:17.720
Prof: The dividends.
 

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.048
So what are the dividends?
 

00:26:19.048 --> 00:26:22.772
Well, you bought
theta_alpha to begin

00:26:22.772 --> 00:26:25.930
with so that's
D^(alpha)_2.

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:29.655
So if you bought the whole tree
then you've got all the

00:26:29.655 --> 00:26:32.210
dividends, and similarly with
beta.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:33.520
Theta_beta times
D^(beta)_2

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.605
[correction:
theta_beta times

00:26:34.605 --> 00:26:35.744
D^(beta)_2 times
q_2.

00:26:35.744 --> 00:26:37.257
And, theta_alpha
times D^(alpha)_2

00:26:37.257 --> 00:26:38.740
should also be multiplied by
q_2].

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:39.170
So that's it.
 

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:42.599
So the budget set is a little
more complicated.

00:26:42.599 --> 00:26:44.779
So that's the budget set.
 

00:26:44.779 --> 00:26:47.582
So it's got 2 equalities
instead of 1 equality,

00:26:47.582 --> 00:26:50.690
so already things look a little
more complicated.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:57.354
Now, so an equilibrium is going
to have to be that i chooses

00:26:57.354 --> 00:27:02.438
(X^(i)_1,
X^(i)_2),

00:27:02.438 --> 00:27:06.204
theta_alpha--
I can write,

00:27:06.204 --> 00:27:12.448
theta^(i)_alpha,
theta^(i)_beta,

00:27:12.448 --> 00:27:24.096
that's all the choices he has
to maximize U^(i) subject to

00:27:24.096 --> 00:27:27.980
this budget set.
 

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.259
So A's going to pick what
shares to hold,

00:27:31.259 --> 00:27:33.640
how much to consume today,
then, of course,

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.614
looking forward A's going to be
able to figure out what he's

00:27:36.614 --> 00:27:38.480
going to end up consuming
tomorrow.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:43.237
All right so,
and now in equilibrium we have

00:27:43.237 --> 00:27:49.653
to have that (X^(A)_1
X^(B)_1) has to =

00:27:49.653 --> 00:27:54.298
(E^(A)_1
E^(B)_1).

00:27:54.298 --> 00:27:58.393
And then we do the shares,
theta^(A)_alpha

00:27:58.393 --> 00:28:03.450
theta^(B)_alpha has to
= theta-bar^(A)_alpha

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.828
theta-bar^(B)_alpha,
right?

00:28:06.828 --> 00:28:12.185
The stock market has to clear
and theta^(A)_beta

00:28:12.185 --> 00:28:17.917
theta^(B)_beta has to
= theta-bar^(A)_beta

00:28:17.917 --> 00:28:21.019
theta-bar^(B)_beta.
 

00:28:21.019 --> 00:28:25.275
So in period 1 the demand for
apples has to equal the supply

00:28:25.275 --> 00:28:28.231
of all the agents,
but now what's the last

00:28:28.231 --> 00:28:29.170
equation?
 

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:30.220
This is a little trickier.
 

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.750
What's the last equation?
 

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:36.882
X^(A)_2
X^(B)_2 =

00:28:36.882 --> 00:28:42.869
E^(A)_2
E^(B)_2 ....

00:28:42.869 --> 00:28:44.849
Is that it?
 

00:28:44.849 --> 00:28:45.309
No.
 

00:28:45.309 --> 00:28:46.640
There's something else.
 

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.048
Student: Plus dividends.
 

00:28:50.048 --> 00:28:53.324
Prof: The total
consumption of apples is going

00:28:53.324 --> 00:28:56.410
to be the apples that they have
on the ground,

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:58.599
but also the ones that were
picked off the trees,

00:28:58.599 --> 00:29:00.200
so these dividends.
 

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:04.353
So it's going to be the total
dividends which are

00:29:04.353 --> 00:29:09.632
[(theta-bar^(A)_alpha
theta-bar^(B)_alpha)

00:29:09.632 --> 00:29:14.328
times that tree--
D^(alpha)_2]

00:29:14.328 --> 00:29:22.051
[(theta-bar^(A)_beta
theta-bar^(B)_beta)

00:29:22.051 --> 00:29:26.108
times D^(beta)_2].
 

00:29:26.108 --> 00:29:29.535
So just to say it in words,
it's exactly what we had before

00:29:29.535 --> 00:29:33.019
except we have to take into
account in addition to the goods

00:29:33.019 --> 00:29:35.681
market clearing,
we have to take into account

00:29:35.681 --> 00:29:37.509
that the stock market has to
clear.

00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:41.775
And in the end demand for goods
has to equal the supply that

00:29:41.775 --> 00:29:46.257
people had in their endowments,
but also what the companies are

00:29:46.257 --> 00:29:47.269
producing.
 

00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:49.680
These companies are producing
output, apples.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:54.714
And so that's part of what the
consumption is going to be in

00:29:54.714 --> 00:29:55.910
the economy.
 

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:57.009
Are you with me here?
 

00:29:57.009 --> 00:30:00.569
It's a good time for questions,
maybe.

00:30:00.569 --> 00:30:01.480
Yes?
 

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.699
Student: Could you just
explain again why we don't take

00:30:04.699 --> 00:30:06.808
stocks into consideration in
period 2?

00:30:06.808 --> 00:30:09.838
Prof: So in period 2 you
might wonder,

00:30:09.838 --> 00:30:14.359
pi_alpha is the price
of the stock at period 1,

00:30:14.359 --> 00:30:15.910
stock alpha in period 1.
 

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:20.220
Pi_beta's the price
of the stock beta in period 1.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.143
How come I didn't write down
the price of the stocks in

00:30:23.143 --> 00:30:26.500
period 2 and keep track of what
they're holding in period 2?

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:30.244
And the reason is that when you
buy a stock you're buying it not

00:30:30.244 --> 00:30:33.099
for the dividends at this same
moment in time.

00:30:33.099 --> 00:30:34.230
You don't get those dividends.
 

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:36.338
The guy who already had it gets
those dividends.

00:30:36.338 --> 00:30:39.180
When you buy the stock you're
buying it for the future

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.503
dividends you can get,
and I've assumed the world's

00:30:42.503 --> 00:30:46.614
going to end after 2 periods
because nobody's utility cares

00:30:46.614 --> 00:30:47.890
about period 3.
 

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:52.279
So if you buy the stock in
period 2 it's too late for you

00:30:52.279 --> 00:30:53.690
to get anything.
 

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:56.721
There are no dividends because
you can only get them in period

00:30:56.721 --> 00:30:57.667
3,
and there won't be any

00:30:57.667 --> 00:30:59.441
dividends in period 3,
and if there were you wouldn't

00:30:59.441 --> 00:31:00.250
care about them anyway.
 

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.818
So the stock's worthless to you.
 

00:31:01.818 --> 00:31:04.446
So the price of the stock in
period 2, of both stocks,

00:31:04.446 --> 00:31:05.390
is going to be 0.
 

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:08.038
So there's no point in putting
down what people are buying of

00:31:08.038 --> 00:31:09.630
the stocks or selling or
anything.

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:11.150
It's just not worth anything.
 

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:14.405
But in general you're right,
and we're going to be more

00:31:14.405 --> 00:31:17.843
complicated later when you look
at your income from having

00:31:17.843 --> 00:31:19.170
bought the stocks.
 

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:22.011
You'll have as your income the
dividend from the stocks plus

00:31:22.011 --> 00:31:24.710
the resale value of the stock,
because you could sell the

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:25.769
stock next period.
 

00:31:25.769 --> 00:31:28.634
But I just know the resale
value's going to be zero because

00:31:28.634 --> 00:31:30.759
you're in the last period of the
economy.

00:31:30.759 --> 00:31:37.400
And I just want to keep it very
simple this first time.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.394
Step by step you'll be able to
keep very complicated things in

00:31:40.394 --> 00:31:43.289
your head but not right at
first, so any other questions?

00:31:43.289 --> 00:31:44.368
Yes?
 

00:31:44.368 --> 00:31:48.432
Student: Why are there
endowments in period 1 and

00:31:48.432 --> 00:31:50.500
&gt;?
 

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.441
Prof: You mean why do
people have endowments today and

00:31:54.441 --> 00:31:55.230
next year?
 

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:56.920
Because you could think of the
endowment,

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.190
for example,
as--here we've got apples,

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:01.338
but usually the endowment is
your labor,

00:32:01.338 --> 00:32:05.618
so you can work this year--your
most important endowment is your

00:32:05.618 --> 00:32:07.250
energy and your labor.
 

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:08.440
So you've got it this year.
 

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:12.440
Next year if you're still alive
that's new labor that you have.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.368
It's a different good so it's a
second endowment that you have.

00:32:15.368 --> 00:32:18.496
So I don't want to get caught
up in labor and all that and get

00:32:18.496 --> 00:32:21.365
involved with Marx again,
so I'm just going to talk about

00:32:21.365 --> 00:32:21.930
apples.
 

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:24.970
You have an endowment of apples
when you're young and next year

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:27.078
somehow you're going to have
more apples.

00:32:27.078 --> 00:32:30.511
So you might have thought that
the only apples next year come

00:32:30.511 --> 00:32:32.630
from what the firms are
producing,

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:35.971
but I allowed for the
possibility that people have

00:32:35.971 --> 00:32:39.039
apples too just like their labor
next year.

00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:42.670
Other questions?
 

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:43.380
Yeah?
 

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.826
Student: We then have to
define E_2^(A) and

00:32:45.826 --> 00:32:48.190
E_2^(B) in terms of
first period endowments,

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:52.900
or is that something implied in
the equation?

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.435
Prof: I should have
written this more carefully

00:32:56.435 --> 00:32:56.970
maybe.
 

00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:04.773
E^(A)_1 and
E^(A)_2 is that,

00:33:04.773 --> 00:33:15.068
and this is E^(B)_1
and E^(B)_2 is that.

00:33:15.068 --> 00:33:19.628
So as he was suggesting back
there I've assumed for person B

00:33:19.628 --> 00:33:21.868
that he's got an apple now.
 

00:33:21.868 --> 00:33:23.980
We aren't modeling what
happened to get us here.

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:25.369
The guys got an apple today.
 

00:33:25.369 --> 00:33:26.740
They both have an apple today.
 

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:30.628
Somehow A's also going to have
another apple tomorrow that he's

00:33:30.628 --> 00:33:34.141
going to find under his doorstep
somehow that isn't being

00:33:34.141 --> 00:33:35.710
produced by the tree.
 

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:40.476
And maybe you can think of it
as labor that he's going to have

00:33:40.476 --> 00:33:41.569
next period.
 

00:33:41.569 --> 00:33:44.400
All right, so that's it.
 

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.939
Fisher says as soon as you
write down the economy

00:33:46.939 --> 00:33:50.060
mathematically all sorts of
things are going to occur to you

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:53.182
which if you're talking in words
about justice and injustice

00:33:53.182 --> 00:33:54.769
you're going to be lost.
 

00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:59.240
So what can we get right away
out of this?

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.548
What can we get right away out
of this?

00:34:00.548 --> 00:34:05.049
Well, the first thing is,
how would we define inflation?

00:34:05.049 --> 00:34:12.280
What is inflation?
 

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.230
What's inflation in this
economy?

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.659
Assuming we've got the
equilibrium,

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:19.130
which we're going to get soon,
we're going to calculate it,

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:20.820
but right now we don't what the
numbers--

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:23.420
you know we've got a bunch of
equations and stuff.

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.949
We don't know what
X^(A)_1 and

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:27.262
q_1 and q_2
are going to turn out to be,

00:34:27.262 --> 00:34:28.909
but we're going to find out
very soon.

00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:32.284
But before we find out,
assuming we've gotten those,

00:34:32.284 --> 00:34:33.940
what will inflation be?
 

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:40.989
What is inflation?
 

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:41.719
Yeah?
 

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:45.043
Student: Is it how much
the ratio of the price of the

00:34:45.043 --> 00:34:46.340
dividend has changed?
 

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.480
Prof: Well,
we're talking about inflation.

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.367
When you talk about the
Consumer Price Index,

00:34:50.367 --> 00:34:53.059
inflation, what are they
talking about?

00:34:53.059 --> 00:34:53.610
Yeah?
 

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:54.672
Student: It's the rise
of q_1 and

00:34:54.672 --> 00:34:55.018
q_2.
 

00:34:55.018 --> 00:34:57.942
Prof: So inflation is
just q_2 over

00:34:57.942 --> 00:34:59.260
q_1,
right?

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.079
So that's the price of apples
today.

00:35:01.079 --> 00:35:02.389
That's the price of apples next
year.

00:35:02.389 --> 00:35:04.514
If the price of apples next
year is bigger than this year

00:35:04.514 --> 00:35:05.349
we've got inflation.
 

00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:06.840
If it's lower we've got
deflation.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:10.949
So already the model,
you're talking about inflation.

00:35:10.949 --> 00:35:12.409
What else?
 

00:35:12.409 --> 00:35:16.530
What's the next most obvious?
 

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:20.402
Well, I think I'm going to skip
a bunch of stuff and get now to

00:35:20.402 --> 00:35:21.340
the key idea.
 

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:27.929
The key idea is arbitrage.
 

00:35:27.929 --> 00:35:30.949
So Fisher says,
"People have

00:35:30.949 --> 00:35:32.650
foresight."
 

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:34.750
They're anticipating what the
dividends are going to be.

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:39.697
They understand that you can
talk about how beautiful the

00:35:39.697 --> 00:35:41.746
tree is,
and how much you like the

00:35:41.746 --> 00:35:43.599
owners, and how much they're
watering it,

00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:47.429
and whether they have a good
plan for irrigation,

00:35:47.429 --> 00:35:50.980
and whether they did well in
college and stuff like that,

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.648
but in the end all you care
about the trees is how many

00:35:53.648 --> 00:35:55.329
apples they're going to produce.
 

00:35:55.329 --> 00:35:58.186
So knowing that,
can we say something about

00:35:58.186 --> 00:36:01.929
pi_alpha pi alpha
versus pi_beta?

00:36:01.929 --> 00:36:04.079
In equilibrium what's going to
have to happen?

00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:07.300
There is going to be some
connection, and what's the

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.880
connection going to be?
 

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.260
You've got two trees.
 

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:12.989
Yeah?
 

00:36:12.989 --> 00:36:14.719
Student: The ratio
between the prices would be the

00:36:14.719 --> 00:36:16.139
ratio between the
&gt;?

00:36:16.139 --> 00:36:19.231
Prof: Right,
so pi_alpha is going

00:36:19.231 --> 00:36:23.751
to be pi_beta times
D[^(alpha)_2 over

00:36:23.751 --> 00:36:32.804
D^(beta)_2]--
alpha will be better as long as

00:36:32.804 --> 00:36:36.215
the--
hopefully I've got that in the

00:36:36.215 --> 00:36:37.110
right order.
 

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:40.588
And so in this case
pi_alpha is going to

00:36:40.588 --> 00:36:44.920
equal a half pi_beta,
because alpha's producing half

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.690
the dividend that beta's
producing.

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:50.360
So obviously it's going to turn
out to have half the price.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.110
That's the fundamental
principle.

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:55.539
We're doing it in the most
trivial case,

00:36:55.539 --> 00:36:59.132
but it's the most fundamental
principle of finance that if

00:36:59.132 --> 00:37:02.726
you've got two assets and
they're basically the same up to

00:37:02.726 --> 00:37:06.510
scale then their prices have to
be the same up to scale.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:11.114
Who's going to bother to buy
alpha if it costs the same

00:37:11.114 --> 00:37:15.550
amount as beta when it only
produces half as much?

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:16.599
Yes?
 

00:37:16.599 --> 00:37:18.780
Student: Is that the
same thing as saying that their

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.210
yields will converge,
that equation?

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:22.153
Prof: Well,
it is something like that,

00:37:22.153 --> 00:37:24.320
but that's a word that we
haven't defined yet,

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.449
so we're going to define it in
the next class.

00:37:26.449 --> 00:37:29.739
So it's something like that,
yep.

00:37:29.739 --> 00:37:31.699
Any other?
 

00:37:31.699 --> 00:37:35.590
So that is a very simple thing.
 

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:56.637
Suppose after finding the
equilibrium I added a third

00:37:56.637 --> 00:38:16.469
asset that paid 1 dollar in
period 2 next year.

00:38:16.469 --> 00:38:22.460
Now, it would have a price
of--added a third asset gamma,

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.443
so pi_gamma--we'd
have to solve for the

00:38:24.443 --> 00:38:28.626
equilibrium pi_gamma,
and is there some word that I

00:38:28.626 --> 00:38:29.679
could use?
 

00:38:29.679 --> 00:38:35.030
So gamma is an asset that pays
a dollar in period 2.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:37.989
It's like a bond promising a
dollar in period two.

00:38:37.989 --> 00:38:42.639
The price of the bond would
then have to be what?

00:38:42.639 --> 00:38:51.070
1 over (1 i) where i is called
the nominal interest rate,

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:58.750
so we've got inflation is
occurring in the model.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.583
If I added a bond,
which I didn't bother to do

00:39:00.583 --> 00:39:03.110
because it's just yet another
thing I'd have to write down,

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:06.449
I could have had a third asset
which pays a dollar.

00:39:06.449 --> 00:39:09.239
The others are paying off in
apples.

00:39:09.239 --> 00:39:12.469
This one's paying a dollar and
its price today,

00:39:12.469 --> 00:39:16.583
if you pay 80 cents today it's
like saying I'm paying 80 cents

00:39:16.583 --> 00:39:18.438
today,
I'm getting a whole dollar

00:39:18.438 --> 00:39:18.920
tomorrow.
 

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:24.793
So it's like a 25 percent rate
of interest, because another way

00:39:24.793 --> 00:39:30.099
of saying it is that 1 over
pi_gamma is 1 i.

00:39:30.099 --> 00:39:31.610
I put only pi_gamma
in today,

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:34.193
I get 1 out tomorrow so I've
gotten back not only the

00:39:34.193 --> 00:39:36.730
pi_gamma I put in but
something extra,

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:39.860
that's 1 the interest rate.
 

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.070
So this world is going to have
an interest rate in it.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:46.199
It's going to have inflation in
it.

00:39:46.199 --> 00:39:51.409
With me so far?
 

00:39:51.409 --> 00:39:53.190
Let me add one more thing.
 

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:54.489
I could come back to this.
 

00:39:54.489 --> 00:40:00.405
So I said that if you take
theta_alpha less than

00:40:00.405 --> 00:40:06.840
theta-bar_alpha it
means you're selling the stock.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:11.001
So I'm going to allow people to
go even further,

00:40:11.001 --> 00:40:14.190
theta_alpha less than
0.

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:19.967
So let me just write that
again, theta_alpha

00:40:19.967 --> 00:40:24.327
less than
theta-bar_alpha means

00:40:24.327 --> 00:40:26.289
selling alpha.
 

00:40:26.289 --> 00:40:29.275
Theta_alpha less than
0 is doing a lot more than

00:40:29.275 --> 00:40:29.800
selling.
 

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.360
You don't have it to begin
with, so what are you selling?

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.315
Well, the mathematics is
telling you that over there

00:40:36.315 --> 00:40:39.039
theta_alpha's going to
be negative.

00:40:39.039 --> 00:40:42.248
Instead of getting extra
dividends you're going to be

00:40:42.248 --> 00:40:46.072
giving up dividends because it's
going to reduce your supply of

00:40:46.072 --> 00:40:46.690
money.
 

00:40:46.690 --> 00:41:01.159
So theta_alpha less
than 0 is called selling short--

00:41:01.159 --> 00:41:04.980
I don't know which one I've
lost, but it's got to be bad--

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:18.670
 
 

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.119
if you can still hear
me--you're selling short,

00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:24.949
this means.
 

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:27.429
So you're selling something you
don't even have.

00:41:27.429 --> 00:41:32.139
It's also called naked selling.
 

00:41:32.139 --> 00:41:47.760
It's also called making a
promise without collateral.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:51.659
So I'm going to,
for now, allow for that.

00:41:51.659 --> 00:41:54.130
So we're not taking into
account that anybody's

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:54.829
defaulting.
 

00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:56.614
If you take
theta_alpha negative

00:41:56.614 --> 00:41:59.054
it means your income in the
future is going to be reduced

00:41:59.054 --> 00:42:01.623
because you're going to have to
deliver the dividend because

00:42:01.623 --> 00:42:03.670
you're going to have negative
dividends,

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:06.632
which means effectively you
take out of your endowment those

00:42:06.632 --> 00:42:08.190
dividends and hand them over.
 

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:11.989
So it's as if you always keep
your promises.

00:42:11.989 --> 00:42:15.059
So this model so far,
the Fisher model,

00:42:15.059 --> 00:42:17.969
assumes no default,
no collateral.

00:42:17.969 --> 00:42:21.648
We're not worrying about any of
that stuff, and of course that's

00:42:21.648 --> 00:42:23.460
going to be a critical thing.
 

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:28.760
So you see something's happened
that we never had happen before.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.980
In the past you traded money
for a football ticket.

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:35.130
You gave up something you
wanted you got something that

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:36.179
you also wanted.
 

00:42:36.179 --> 00:42:37.960
It was a trade of value for
value.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.052
Everybody agreed the two things
you traded were equally

00:42:40.052 --> 00:42:40.480
valuable.
 

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.159
If you take
theta_alpha negative,

00:42:43.159 --> 00:42:46.530
by taking theta_alpha
negative that becomes a negative

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:48.940
number here so it allows you to
spend more.

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.904
You can buy more goods by
taking theta_alpha

00:42:51.904 --> 00:42:52.519
negative.
 

00:42:52.519 --> 00:42:53.340
That's negative.
 

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.753
That means this can be more
positive and still satisfy this

00:42:56.753 --> 00:42:57.518
constraint.
 

00:42:57.518 --> 00:43:01.083
So by selling a stock short
you're promising to do something

00:43:01.083 --> 00:43:02.050
in the future.
 

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:04.003
You get more money now you can
eat more now,

00:43:04.003 --> 00:43:06.548
and then of course you have to
consume less in the future

00:43:06.548 --> 00:43:08.639
because you have to pay back
your promise.

00:43:08.639 --> 00:43:11.309
So you're exchanging something
valuable,

00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:13.889
you're getting money,
something valuable in exchange

00:43:13.889 --> 00:43:16.771
for a promise which is worth
nothing until the future when

00:43:16.771 --> 00:43:18.389
you deliver on your promise.
 

00:43:18.389 --> 00:43:20.951
When you buy the stock you're
buying part of the tree,

00:43:20.951 --> 00:43:23.030
but the tree's doing nothing
for you now.

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:25.286
You're doing it because it's
going to be valuable next

00:43:25.286 --> 00:43:25.670
period.
 

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:27.742
You're actually not physically
owning the tree,

00:43:27.742 --> 00:43:30.447
you're owning a piece of paper
that gives you a right to half

00:43:30.447 --> 00:43:31.800
the dividends of the tree.
 

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.164
So you're getting something
that's only good because it's a

00:43:34.164 --> 00:43:35.550
promise you think is being kept.
 

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:39.012
So, so far for the next few
lectures we're going to ignore

00:43:39.012 --> 00:43:42.717
the fact that people get very
nervous when they give something

00:43:42.717 --> 00:43:46.179
up that's valuable in exchange
for something that's just a

00:43:46.179 --> 00:43:47.030
promise.
 

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:49.389
So a critical thing has
happened here.

00:43:49.389 --> 00:43:51.815
So we've kept the same
mathematics except we've

00:43:51.815 --> 00:43:54.190
surreptitiously added this huge
assumption.

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:56.873
Now Fisher said,
"Having done that,

00:43:56.873 --> 00:43:58.869
what can you realize?"
 

00:43:58.869 --> 00:44:00.889
This is the most important
insight.

00:44:00.889 --> 00:44:03.320
He said this model it looks so
complicated.

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:05.639
It looks like now we have
vastly more equations.

00:44:05.639 --> 00:44:10.615
No wonder Marx and all those
religious zealots were getting

00:44:10.615 --> 00:44:11.559
confused.
 

00:44:11.559 --> 00:44:15.800
We can simplify it all and be
back to where we were before and

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.539
yet talk about finance.
 

00:44:17.539 --> 00:44:32.389
So Fisher introduced the idea
of present value prices.

00:44:32.389 --> 00:44:36.404
So he said look,
when you buy a stock what are

00:44:36.404 --> 00:44:38.099
you really doing?
 

00:44:38.099 --> 00:44:39.530
This is the principle of
arbitrage.

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:42.222
He says when you buy a stock
you're saying to yourself,

00:44:42.222 --> 00:44:43.619
I'm giving up money today.
 

00:44:43.619 --> 00:44:47.057
Now, money today is consumption
because I would have used that

00:44:47.057 --> 00:44:47.510
money.
 

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:50.090
If I didn't buy stocks I would
have bought apples today and

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:50.670
eaten them.
 

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:53.800
So when I buy a stock I'm
giving up apples today.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.891
I'm getting the stock which is
then paying me dividends

00:44:56.891 --> 00:44:59.476
tomorrow,
which whatever they are I'm

00:44:59.476 --> 00:45:02.030
selling off,
I'm getting a profit out of the

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:04.820
stock tomorrow and I'm ending up
with apples tomorrow.

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.099
Maybe I'm just eating the
dividends straight off the tree.

00:45:07.099 --> 00:45:11.452
So when I buy a stock I'm
really giving up apples today

00:45:11.452 --> 00:45:13.869
and getting apples tomorrow.
 

00:45:13.869 --> 00:45:16.733
And no matter how I do it,
whether it's through stock

00:45:16.733 --> 00:45:19.099
alpha,
or through stock beta,

00:45:19.099 --> 00:45:23.945
or through a nominal bond it's
got to be the case that all

00:45:23.945 --> 00:45:27.458
three ways,
or all 50 other ways you could

00:45:27.458 --> 00:45:31.340
imagine doing it have to give me
the same tradeoff.

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:32.972
This is your yield you were
talking about,

00:45:32.972 --> 00:45:33.768
the same tradeoff.
 

00:45:33.768 --> 00:45:36.577
The amount of apples I
effectively give up today in

00:45:36.577 --> 00:45:40.003
order to get apples tomorrow is
going to be the same no matter

00:45:40.003 --> 00:45:41.239
which way I do it.
 

00:45:41.239 --> 00:45:44.898
If it weren't the same,
if alpha's price was more than

00:45:44.898 --> 00:45:47.800
a half of beta's nobody would
buy alpha.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.949
In fact they would start
selling alpha.

00:45:50.949 --> 00:45:52.969
So that's why this assumption
is so important.

00:45:52.969 --> 00:45:53.449
What would they do?
 

00:45:53.449 --> 00:45:56.135
Not only would nobody would buy
alpha, but they start selling

00:45:56.135 --> 00:45:56.360
it.
 

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:59.351
They'd say well,
alpha is so expensive,

00:45:59.351 --> 00:46:03.920
let's say it's the same price
as beta, I can sell alpha.

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:07.226
With every alpha I sell I can
buy stock beta,

00:46:07.226 --> 00:46:11.663
and so I haven't done anything
today, but in the future I've

00:46:11.663 --> 00:46:14.670
got stock beta which is paying
me 2.

00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:17.134
I owe, because I sold stock
alpha short I owe 1,

00:46:17.134 --> 00:46:20.280
so I'll pay off the 1 I owe and
I'll still be left with 1.

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:23.449
I'm making an arbitrage profit,
and so I'm not going to stop at

00:46:23.449 --> 00:46:24.829
selling 1 share of alpha.
 

00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:27.099
I'll sell 2 shares of alpha,
then 3 shares of alpha,

00:46:27.099 --> 00:46:30.956
then a million shares of alpha,
and everybody'll be selling

00:46:30.956 --> 00:46:34.813
alpha short to buy beta and the
market for alpha will never

00:46:34.813 --> 00:46:35.480
clear.
 

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.510
So that's why the prices will
have to adjust.

00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:40.079
And so it has to be in
equilibrium,

00:46:40.079 --> 00:46:42.969
the price of alpha's exactly
half the price of beta,

00:46:42.969 --> 00:46:48.407
which is to say,
in short, that if you solve for

00:46:48.407 --> 00:46:54.657
this equilibrium you can solve
for an equilibrium where

00:46:54.657 --> 00:47:01.485
P_1 = q_1 is
the price today of an apple

00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:07.389
today,
and P_2 is the price

00:47:07.389 --> 00:47:16.333
today (that's why it's called
present value price) of an apple

00:47:16.333 --> 00:47:18.239
next year.
 

00:47:18.239 --> 00:47:22.416
So if you've got this
equilibrium by working your way

00:47:22.416 --> 00:47:26.300
through,
by figuring out what the price

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.447
of alpha is--
so the stock,

00:47:28.447 --> 00:47:30.920
for example,
you want to figure out what the

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:31.610
stock is.
 

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:36.302
Suppose the stock of alpha,
suppose the price turns out to

00:47:36.302 --> 00:47:37.289
be a half.
 

00:47:37.289 --> 00:47:41.800
Then by paying a half today you
can buy stock alpha,

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.780
which is going to pay you a
whole dividend.

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:48.972
So the price,
therefore, of an entire--oh,

00:47:48.972 --> 00:47:50.219
let's do beta.
 

00:47:50.219 --> 00:47:54.170
Suppose the price of beta is a
quarter.

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:57.121
Suppose we happen to find out
that the price of beta is a

00:47:57.121 --> 00:47:57.650
quarter.
 

00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:59.409
Then what's P_2?
 

00:47:59.409 --> 00:48:04.730
How much do you have to give up
today in order to get an apple?

00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:07.405
Well, by paying a quarter
today, that's the price,

00:48:07.405 --> 00:48:10.409
by paying a quarter today
you're getting 2 dividends.

00:48:10.409 --> 00:48:13.260
So by paying a quarter today
you're getting 2 dividends.

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:17.327
If you paid to get 1 dividend
you'd have to pay an eighth

00:48:17.327 --> 00:48:17.909
today.
 

00:48:17.909 --> 00:48:23.000
So the price P_2
would be an eighth in that case.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.585
So by piercing through the veil
of the stock market you can

00:48:26.585 --> 00:48:30.050
always figure out what you're
effectively paying today in

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:32.400
order to get an apple next
period.

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.744
And that price which was just
computed would be the same

00:48:34.744 --> 00:48:37.387
whether we looked at it from the
point of view of going through

00:48:37.387 --> 00:48:38.936
stock beta,
or through stock alpha,

00:48:38.936 --> 00:48:40.030
or through the nominal bond.
 

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:41.599
It would always have to give us
the same answer.

00:48:41.599 --> 00:48:45.887
So we know, from the financial
equilibrium, we can deduce what

00:48:45.887 --> 00:48:50.106
P_1 and P_2
have to be, the present value

00:48:50.106 --> 00:48:50.880
prices.
 

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:58.661
And so effectively,
furthermore,

00:48:58.661 --> 00:49:12.969
stocks effectively just add to
the endowments of goods.

00:49:12.969 --> 00:49:17.119
So we can now consider another
economy.

00:49:17.119 --> 00:49:22.340
So let's consider the economy
E-hat, so the hat economy.

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:27.166
So U-hat-^(A) of X_1
and X_2 is the same as

00:49:27.166 --> 00:49:30.347
it was before,
U^(A) of X_1,

00:49:30.347 --> 00:49:33.840
X_2,
U-hat^(B )of X_1 and

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:37.139
X_2 is the same as it
was before,

00:49:37.139 --> 00:49:41.748
but endowments now
E-hat^(A)_1

00:49:41.748 --> 00:49:46.949
E-hat^(A)_2 is going
to be what?

00:49:46.949 --> 00:49:51.449
Well, A over here began with 1
unit of each good,

00:49:51.449 --> 00:49:57.170
but A also owned all of stock
alpha and half of stock beta.

00:49:57.170 --> 00:50:00.719
So all of stock alpha pays 1
dividend in the future,

00:50:00.719 --> 00:50:04.141
so really A effectively has
claim on two apples in the

00:50:04.141 --> 00:50:08.014
future and another half of beta
which is another apple in the

00:50:08.014 --> 00:50:13.172
future,
so really A's initial endowment

00:50:13.172 --> 00:50:15.860
of goods is (1,3).
 

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:17.268
How did I get that again?
 

00:50:17.268 --> 00:50:21.170
I said it was 1 apple to begin
with he could anticipate having.

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:26.349
He knew he owned all of stock
alpha which pays 1 apple,

00:50:26.349 --> 00:50:28.059
so that's another one that's
really his,

00:50:28.059 --> 00:50:30.851
and then in the future he's
going to get half of the

00:50:30.851 --> 00:50:33.889
dividends of stock beta,
and half of 2 is also 1.

00:50:33.889 --> 00:50:40.389
So he's got 3 apples in the
future.

00:50:40.389 --> 00:50:43.711
And E-hat^(B)2,
well his 1 doesn't change

00:50:43.711 --> 00:50:47.034
today, but what's his claim,
effectively,

00:50:47.034 --> 00:50:49.610
on dividends in the future?
 

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:55.250
Student: 1.
 

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:57.429
Prof: 1, thank you.
 

00:50:57.429 --> 00:50:58.768
Somebody answered that.
 

00:50:58.768 --> 00:51:03.684
So we've now reduced the
financial equilibrium to a

00:51:03.684 --> 00:51:08.697
general equilibrium,
the same kind of economy we had

00:51:08.697 --> 00:51:09.780
before.
 

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:12.753
It's just that we had to
augment the endowments to take

00:51:12.753 --> 00:51:15.840
into account that people own
stuff through the stocks.

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:19.369
So what's the equilibrium of
this economy?

00:51:19.369 --> 00:51:22.440
This has a simple general
equilibrium.

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.570
So what is it?
 

00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:26.429
How do we solve for equilibrium?
 

00:51:26.429 --> 00:51:31.293
Well, take P_1 = 1
and we'll solve for

00:51:31.293 --> 00:51:32.949
P_2.
 

00:51:32.949 --> 00:51:35.489
So let's just clear the first
market.

00:51:35.489 --> 00:51:39.349
How do you clear it?
 

00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:40.010
You're with me here?
 

00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:42.972
It's a standard general
equilibrium, the same kind we've

00:51:42.972 --> 00:51:44.320
done many times before.
 

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:47.119
So see if I can do it.
 

00:51:47.119 --> 00:51:50.257
So person 1 is going to spend a
third of his money [correction:

00:51:50.257 --> 00:51:52.583
will be two thirds],
and how much money does he

00:51:52.583 --> 00:51:53.039
have?
 

00:51:53.039 --> 00:52:00.641
He has (1 P_2 times
3), that's A,

00:52:00.641 --> 00:52:02.090
right?
 

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:03.340
His endowment is (1,3).
 

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:06.492
This is his income,
and he's spending a third of it

00:52:06.492 --> 00:52:07.250
on good 1.
 

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:10.213
And the price of good 1,
P_1,

00:52:10.213 --> 00:52:11.539
here is just 1.
 

00:52:11.539 --> 00:52:16.288
And then B is going to spend,
he's a half,

00:52:16.288 --> 00:52:22.309
half Cobb-Douglas guy,
so this is 1 and this is 1.

00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:27.416
He's spending half of his money
and his income is [1

00:52:27.416 --> 00:52:30.920
P_2 times 1]
divided by 1,

00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:37.030
and that has to equal the total
endowment which is 2,1 1.

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:39.570
So did I go too fast?
 

00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:40.179
Yes?
 

00:52:40.179 --> 00:52:41.070
Student: Why is it a
third?

00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:41.929
Prof: Well,
it's probably wrong.

00:52:41.929 --> 00:52:43.619
So let's try it again.
 

00:52:43.619 --> 00:52:47.130
Maybe it's 2 thirds.
 

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:48.530
Let's see what I was doing.
 

00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:52.887
I've taken the financial
economy, which was very

00:52:52.887 --> 00:52:55.706
complicated,
looks very hard to solve and

00:52:55.706 --> 00:52:58.764
Fisher says of course when we
add uncertainty and things like

00:52:58.764 --> 00:53:01.159
that we're going to have to do
other tricks.

00:53:01.159 --> 00:53:04.458
But without uncertainty,
with perfect foresight and so

00:53:04.458 --> 00:53:07.572
on, and no uncertainty,
Fisher says this is an easy

00:53:07.572 --> 00:53:08.880
problem to solve.
 

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:11.483
You take the financial
equilibrium with all its extra

00:53:11.483 --> 00:53:14.235
variables and you realize if
people are rational they're

00:53:14.235 --> 00:53:16.840
going to see through all that
complicated stuff.

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:19.590
They're going to realize that
alpha is just half as good as

00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:21.715
beta,
and so they're going to realize

00:53:21.715 --> 00:53:24.755
that by holding stock they're
making a certain tradeoff

00:53:24.755 --> 00:53:26.219
between alpha and beta.
 

00:53:26.219 --> 00:53:35.710
And we calculated the tradeoff.
 

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:38.030
What was P_2?
 

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:39.210
I forgot what P_2 was.
 

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:41.360
Anyway, how much did you have
to pay?

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:45.570
If you pay pi_alpha
divided by

00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:50.103
D^(alpha)_2,
something like that,

00:53:50.103 --> 00:53:52.480
was P_2.
 

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:55.309
So if it costs you a certain
amount of money,

00:53:55.309 --> 00:54:02.518
if it costs you a quarter we
said, so this is P_2,

00:54:02.518 --> 00:54:05.034
so through either stock,
like beta's the one I solved it

00:54:05.034 --> 00:54:05.309
for.
 

00:54:05.309 --> 00:54:07.722
I said suppose beta,
that's also equal to

00:54:07.722 --> 00:54:10.679
pi_alpha over
D^(alpha)_2,

00:54:10.679 --> 00:54:13.871
we said if the price of beta
turns out to be a quarter and

00:54:13.871 --> 00:54:17.231
you're getting two dividends
then by paying a quarter you get

00:54:17.231 --> 00:54:18.239
two dividends.
 

00:54:18.239 --> 00:54:21.929
So it means to get one apple it
only costs you an eighth,

00:54:21.929 --> 00:54:23.510
an eighth of a dollar.
 

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:25.679
So P_2 we can figure
out.

00:54:25.679 --> 00:54:29.362
So once we've got our financial
equilibrium, it basically is

00:54:29.362 --> 00:54:31.610
determining a general
equilibrium.

00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:33.389
So instead so let's go
backwards.

00:54:33.389 --> 00:54:36.123
Instead of solving for the
financial equilibrium that looks

00:54:36.123 --> 00:54:38.670
complicated let's solve for the
general equilibrium.

00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:40.510
What is the effective general
equilibrium?

00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:43.449
It's the same utilities as
before, but we've augmented the

00:54:43.449 --> 00:54:44.119
endowments.
 

00:54:44.119 --> 00:54:48.166
By looking through the veil of
the stocks we realized that A

00:54:48.166 --> 00:54:50.909
actually owns 3 apples in the
future,

00:54:50.909 --> 00:54:54.157
1 because he owns all of stock
alpha and another one because he

00:54:54.157 --> 00:54:55.518
owns half of stock beta.
 

00:54:55.518 --> 00:54:57.885
So we've got this simple
economy that we're used to

00:54:57.885 --> 00:55:00.014
solving that you did on the
first problem set,

00:55:00.014 --> 00:55:01.860
so we can do it again and solve
it.

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:04.679
So I'm going to now solve for
general equilibrium.

00:55:04.679 --> 00:55:06.510
I have to solve for
P_1 and P_2

00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:08.483
and all the X^(A)_1,
X^(A)_2,

00:55:08.483 --> 00:55:10.010
X^(B)_1,
X^(B)_2,

00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:11.920
but I can fix one of the prices
to be one.

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.840
So I'll fix P_1 to be
1.

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.750
Then what does A do?
 

00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:18.159
So I made a mistake which is
why you weren't following me.

00:55:18.159 --> 00:55:22.157
A, his Cobb-Douglas,
2 thirds of the weight is on

00:55:22.157 --> 00:55:24.739
good 1 and 1 third on good 2.
 

00:55:24.739 --> 00:55:28.369
So he's going to spend 2 thirds
of his money on the first good.

00:55:28.369 --> 00:55:31.112
So that's why this should have
been a 2 thirds as she pointed

00:55:31.112 --> 00:55:31.889
out, thank you.
 

00:55:31.889 --> 00:55:34.518
So 2 thirds of his money,
what's his money?

00:55:34.518 --> 00:55:37.510
His endowment is (1,3),
so it's [(P_1 times

00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:40.215
1), which is 1 times 1,
(3 times P_2)]

00:55:40.215 --> 00:55:42.460
divided by the price
P_1.

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:45.438
2 thirds of the income divided
by the price of the first good,

00:55:45.438 --> 00:55:47.980
that's how many of the first
good he wants to eat.

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:49.460
What does she want to do?
 

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:51.469
She's patient.
 

00:55:51.469 --> 00:55:54.000
She's going to spend half her
income on both goods,

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.456
so half of her income which is
[(1 P_2 times 1)

00:55:58.456 --> 00:56:01.771
divided by 1],
that's how many apples today

00:56:01.771 --> 00:56:05.978
she wants and that's what we
have to clear to clear the apple

00:56:05.978 --> 00:56:07.380
market at time 1.
 

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:11.849
So does this make sense now?
 

00:56:11.849 --> 00:56:13.860
I'm looking at you in the front.
 

00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:23.110
Do you agree with this or is
this confusing now?

00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:24.360
Do you follow this or is this
confusing?

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:25.329
I can say it again if it's
confusing.

00:56:25.329 --> 00:56:26.030
Student: I've got a
question.

00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:26.570
Prof: Yeah?
 

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:30.905
Student: Our denominator
represents what they want to

00:56:30.905 --> 00:56:32.449
have in the future?
 

00:56:32.449 --> 00:56:34.989
Prof: Remember how the
Cobb-Douglas worked?

00:56:34.989 --> 00:56:38.630
This trick I'm going to use
over and over again.

00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:42.789
With log utilities everybody
will spend depending on the

00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:43.849
coefficient.
 

00:56:43.849 --> 00:56:46.297
So remember,
this utility in the problem

00:56:46.297 --> 00:56:50.128
set, you know that this utility
is just the same as if I put 2

00:56:50.128 --> 00:56:52.639
thirds here and 1 third here,
right?

00:56:52.639 --> 00:56:57.949
Because I'm just dividing this
by 3, so instead of 1 and a

00:56:57.949 --> 00:57:02.329
half--so the original utility is
this, right?

00:57:02.329 --> 00:57:07.358
It's (log X_1) (1
half log X_2),

00:57:07.358 --> 00:57:11.599
so the sum of this plus this is
3 halves.

00:57:11.599 --> 00:57:14.110
I can multiply by 2 thirds.
 

00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:17.983
So if I multiply this by 2
thirds I get 2 thirds here and 1

00:57:17.983 --> 00:57:19.320
third here, right?
 

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:21.329
And I haven't changed the
utility function.

00:57:21.329 --> 00:57:23.590
And now I know this is a
familiar pattern.

00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:28.586
A is always going to spend 2
thirds of his money on the first

00:57:28.586 --> 00:57:29.170
good.
 

00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:34.543
And B I can multiple this whole
utility by a half and a half and

00:57:34.543 --> 00:57:37.686
B is going spend--
and now we recognize it as the

00:57:37.686 --> 00:57:40.706
common Cobb-Douglas thing and we
could say that A's [correction:

00:57:40.706 --> 00:57:42.286
B's]
going to spend half his money

00:57:42.286 --> 00:57:45.210
on the first good and half his
money on the second good.

00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:46.300
So what have I done?
 

00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:49.989
Fisher said look,
this model is so complicated.

00:57:49.989 --> 00:57:53.443
You're thinking in your heads,
people are deciding in period 1

00:57:53.443 --> 00:57:56.500
how much stock should I buy,
how many bonds should I buy,

00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:59.192
how many apples should I eat,
but really if they're smart

00:57:59.192 --> 00:58:00.909
they're not going to think that
way.

00:58:00.909 --> 00:58:03.681
They're going to say to
themselves how many apples

00:58:03.681 --> 00:58:04.869
should I buy today?
 

00:58:04.869 --> 00:58:07.219
How many apples do I want to
consume tomorrow?

00:58:07.219 --> 00:58:10.945
All these financial assets are
just methods for me getting

00:58:10.945 --> 00:58:14.018
apples tomorrow in exchange for
apples today.

00:58:14.018 --> 00:58:16.463
And what's the tradeoff between
the apples was

00:58:16.463 --> 00:58:19.288
this--P_1 and
P_2 is the tradeoff

00:58:19.288 --> 00:58:20.320
between apples.
 

00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:22.469
You can look through the stocks
and all that,

00:58:22.469 --> 00:58:25.846
but no matter which stock you
think of buying there's going to

00:58:25.846 --> 00:58:29.168
be the same tradeoff between
apples today and apples tomorrow

00:58:29.168 --> 00:58:30.940
because of the no arbitrage.
 

00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:34.273
The price of alpha is going to
have to be exactly half the

00:58:34.273 --> 00:58:35.210
price of beta.
 

00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:38.726
So once I solve for this
economy and get the price of

00:58:38.726 --> 00:58:42.648
alpha I'll know how many apples
today I have to tradeoff in

00:58:42.648 --> 00:58:44.880
order to get apples tomorrow.
 

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:47.989
So I might as well forget about
all the stocks and just try to

00:58:47.989 --> 00:58:50.795
figure out what must that
tradeoff between P_1

00:58:50.795 --> 00:58:52.070
and P_2 be.
 

00:58:52.070 --> 00:58:55.067
So that's why you can forget
about the stocks,

00:58:55.067 --> 00:58:58.199
forget about the bonds,
everybody's thinking I'm

00:58:58.199 --> 00:59:01.530
trading off apples today for
apples next year.

00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:03.936
I'm making all the trades
today, because I'm trading

00:59:03.936 --> 00:59:06.909
apples today in exchange for
promises for apples next period.

00:59:06.909 --> 00:59:08.889
So it's as if everything
happens today.

00:59:08.889 --> 00:59:11.719
It's as if they're present
value prices today.

00:59:11.719 --> 00:59:14.811
We trade today at prices
P_1 and P_2

00:59:14.811 --> 00:59:17.059
for apples today and apples next
year.

00:59:17.059 --> 00:59:19.268
Of course the apples won't
appear until next year,

00:59:19.268 --> 00:59:23.282
but I can sell an apple today
at price P_1 and buy

00:59:23.282 --> 00:59:27.159
promises for apple next year at
a price P_2,

00:59:27.159 --> 00:59:28.730
and that's the tradeoff I'm
facing.

00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:32.389
If I face that tradeoff how
much of my money am I going to

00:59:32.389 --> 00:59:33.929
spend on apples today?
 

00:59:33.929 --> 00:59:37.918
I'm going to spend 2 thirds of
my money on apples today and the

00:59:37.918 --> 00:59:41.780
other third I'll spend on
promises for apples next period.

00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.500
So this is a big insight Fisher
had.

00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:45.320
It's not surprising it's a
little puzzling.

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.969
I'm so used to it that I've
forgotten how puzzling it is.

00:59:47.969 --> 00:59:49.239
So ask me some more questions.
 

00:59:49.239 --> 00:59:51.510
This was not an obvious thought
Fisher had.

00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:52.110
Yeah?
 

00:59:52.110 --> 00:59:55.771
Student: Do we typically
expect the price in the 2nd

00:59:55.771 --> 00:59:59.179
period to be lower than the
price in the 1st period?

00:59:59.179 --> 01:00:02.000
Prof: Often there'll be
inflation,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.503
so q_2--the
contemporaneous price next

01:00:04.503 --> 01:00:07.539
period might be higher than the
contemporaneous price this

01:00:07.539 --> 01:00:09.679
period,
but we don't care about that.

01:00:09.679 --> 01:00:14.007
What we care about is how many
apples you have to give up today

01:00:14.007 --> 01:00:16.380
in order to get apples tomorrow.
 

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:20.449
So P_2 is the present
value price.

01:00:20.449 --> 01:00:23.277
What do you have to give up
today to get the apple next

01:00:23.277 --> 01:00:23.750
period?
 

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:28.389
So we expect P_2 to
be less than P_1.

01:00:28.389 --> 01:00:30.306
Precisely because,
well, we're going to come to

01:00:30.306 --> 01:00:31.800
that,
that's the next thing I was

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.297
going to talk about because
everybody's putting more weight

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:36.663
on consumption today than they
are on consumption in the

01:00:36.663 --> 01:00:37.179
future.
 

01:00:37.179 --> 01:00:39.574
That's why the price
P_1 is going to be

01:00:39.574 --> 01:00:41.469
bigger than the price
P_2.

01:00:41.469 --> 01:00:42.159
Yep?
 

01:00:42.159 --> 01:00:44.851
Student: When we're
solving it we're solving in real

01:00:44.851 --> 01:00:45.268
prices?
 

01:00:45.268 --> 01:00:47.931
Prof: So we're solving
for P_1 and

01:00:47.931 --> 01:00:50.059
P_2 in present value
prices.

01:00:50.059 --> 01:00:53.364
So the crucial thing is,
he invented this term present

01:00:53.364 --> 01:00:55.860
value prices:
the prices you pay today no

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:58.730
matter when you're going to get
the stuff.

01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:00.059
That's his big insight.
 

01:01:00.059 --> 01:01:02.039
You should look at present
value prices.

01:01:02.039 --> 01:01:06.010
Holding stocks and all that
complicated stuff is just giving

01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:07.760
you goods in the future.
 

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.157
So when you buy the stocks
today you should think,

01:01:10.157 --> 01:01:12.851
how much am I having to pay
today to get an apple in the

01:01:12.851 --> 01:01:13.389
future?
 

01:01:13.389 --> 01:01:15.777
You can deduce that from the
price of stocks and how many

01:01:15.777 --> 01:01:16.929
dividends they're paying.
 

01:01:16.929 --> 01:01:19.610
So everybody must have figured
out a P_2.

01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:20.570
What does it cost today?
 

01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:23.510
How much money do I have to
give up today to get an apple in

01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:24.159
the future?
 

01:01:24.159 --> 01:01:26.755
Well, I have to buy a stock and
then sell the dividends and all

01:01:26.755 --> 01:01:28.425
that,
but really what I should be

01:01:28.425 --> 01:01:31.293
thinking about is what's the
price today I'm paying for one

01:01:31.293 --> 01:01:33.829
apple in the future,
and that's P_2.

01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:35.440
And so when you think about it
that way,

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.349
although it's an intertemporal
problem,

01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:39.250
it looks like a new model with
time,

01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:42.574
Fisher said you can reduce it,
think of it as if they're just

01:01:42.574 --> 01:01:46.012
the same problem we did before
with two goods you're trading at

01:01:46.012 --> 01:01:47.010
the same time.
 

01:01:47.010 --> 01:01:48.750
That's not an obvious thing to
have thought of.

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:50.440
No one thought of it before him.
 

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.190
Yeah?
 

01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:54.445
Student: The budget set,
the second equation from the

01:01:54.445 --> 01:01:55.440
right-hand side.
 

01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:00.036
The second item shouldn't you
have a q_2 as well,

01:02:00.036 --> 01:02:03.840
q_2 times
&gt;?

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.699
Prof: Oh, absolutely.
 

01:02:05.699 --> 01:02:08.353
So this should have been a
q_2 here because you'd

01:02:08.353 --> 01:02:11.190
sell the dividend and you get
money by selling the dividend.

01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:12.530
Thank you.
 

01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:14.829
Ho, ho, ho, very good.
 

01:02:14.829 --> 01:02:17.860
Who said that?
 

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:19.090
Who just asked that question?
 

01:02:19.090 --> 01:02:20.300
Where are you?
 

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:21.050
I'll remember you.
 

01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:22.599
That was very good, exactly.
 

01:02:22.599 --> 01:02:24.699
So in the future you're getting
the money.

01:02:24.699 --> 01:02:28.050
So what he pointed out is I
made another mistake here.

01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:31.916
In the future the money you're
spending on goods in the future

01:02:31.916 --> 01:02:34.579
you're going to get the
dividends paid,

01:02:34.579 --> 01:02:36.556
of course you can sell the
dividends for money and the

01:02:36.556 --> 01:02:37.489
price is q_2.
 

01:02:37.489 --> 01:02:39.552
So a q_2 has to
appear over here just like

01:02:39.552 --> 01:02:41.050
there's a q_2 over
there.

01:02:41.050 --> 01:02:43.510
So it's the goods times the
price.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:46.856
That's the money you're getting
in the future,

01:02:46.856 --> 01:02:50.351
and that's the money you're
spending on the good

01:02:50.351 --> 01:02:51.690
X_2.
 

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:55.559
Very good, too bad you didn't
ask me that a while ago,

01:02:55.559 --> 01:02:56.510
but anyway.
 

01:02:56.510 --> 01:03:00.969
Any other questions?
 

01:03:00.969 --> 01:03:04.429
So we're back to this standard
general equilibrium problem.

01:03:04.429 --> 01:03:07.135
We can take a financial
equilibrium and turn it into a

01:03:07.135 --> 01:03:08.260
general equilibrium.
 

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:15.436
And so when we solve this we're
going to have (2 thirds

01:03:15.436 --> 01:03:21.949
P_2 1 half 1 half
P_2) = 2.

01:03:21.949 --> 01:03:32.827
So it looks like 3 halves (I
hope I haven't done this wrong)

01:03:32.827 --> 01:03:40.570
P_2 = 2 thirds
2P_2.

01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:41.039
Student:
&gt;

01:03:41.039 --> 01:03:42.849
Prof: Thank you,
yeah, plus 2P_2.

01:03:42.849 --> 01:03:47.119
So we have 2P_2 a
half a half P_2 so we

01:03:47.119 --> 01:03:49.329
have 5 halves P_2.
 

01:03:49.329 --> 01:03:52.030
That was lucky you caught that,
5 halves P_2.

01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:57.000
So 2 thirds is 4 sixths.
 

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.760
And 3 sixths is 9 sixths.
 

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:04.940
And 12 sixths - 9 sixths is...
 

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:07.239
What is this?
 

01:04:07.239 --> 01:04:09.929
So what's 2 - 2 thirds - a half?
 

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:10.429
Student: 5 sixths.
 

01:04:10.429 --> 01:04:11.199
Prof: 5 sixths.
 

01:04:11.199 --> 01:04:12.639
That's correct.
 

01:04:12.639 --> 01:04:16.690
So P_2 therefore
equals 1 third.

01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:19.820
All right, so we've now solved
for equilibrium.

01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:25.710
We know that P_1 has
got to be 1.

01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:29.230
P_2 has got to be 1
third.

01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:34.889
We know that we can figure out
what consumption's going to be,

01:04:34.889 --> 01:04:38.300
I mean X^(A)_1,
for example,

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:40.909
if we wanted to solve for that
we just plug in a third here.

01:04:40.909 --> 01:04:47.206
So we'd have (2 thirds) times
(1 3), which is 2 thirds times a

01:04:47.206 --> 01:04:50.510
4, which is 8 thirds,
I guess.

01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:53.443
And X^(B)_1,
we could have solved for that

01:04:53.443 --> 01:04:54.710
too if we wanted to.
 

01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:58.992
X^(B)_1 is going to
be a half times 4 thirds which

01:04:58.992 --> 01:05:00.010
is 2 thirds.
 

01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:04.659
No, that doesn't--a half plus
what was this 1 third?

01:05:04.659 --> 01:05:09.561
No, it's 1 1 third which is 4
thirds times a half which is 2

01:05:09.561 --> 01:05:10.309
thirds.
 

01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:15.820
Is that right?
 

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:18.949
That doesn't look right,
so maybe I did this wrong.

01:05:18.949 --> 01:05:24.489
1 1 is 2 so this is 4 thirds.
 

01:05:24.489 --> 01:05:25.440
That looks better.
 

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:27.449
X^(A)_1 is 4 thirds.
 

01:05:27.449 --> 01:05:29.030
X^(B)_1 is 2 thirds.
 

01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:32.012
So we have 4 thirds and 2
thirds, and so we could solve

01:05:32.012 --> 01:05:35.159
similarly for X^(A)_2
and X^(B)_2,

01:05:35.159 --> 01:05:36.760
which I won't bother to do.
 

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:39.786
So we can figure out what the
prices are, the present value

01:05:39.786 --> 01:05:42.030
prices and the present value
consumption.

01:05:42.030 --> 01:05:43.737
But having done that,
Fisher says,

01:05:43.737 --> 01:05:45.860
we took a hard problem we make
it easy.

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.050
Let's go back to the hard
problem.

01:05:48.050 --> 01:05:53.034
So Fisher says the tradeoff
between good 1 and good 2 is 1

01:05:53.034 --> 01:05:57.320
to a third, so he
defined--here's the nominal rate

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.719
of interest.
 

01:05:58.719 --> 01:06:04.789
Fisher defined something called
the real rate of interest.

01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:07.612
And he said that was a variable
that you should pay a lot of

01:06:07.612 --> 01:06:08.329
attention to.
 

01:06:08.329 --> 01:06:17.204
So the real rate of interest he
said is P_1 divided by

01:06:17.204 --> 01:06:23.402
P_2,
so this is equal to 3 and so r

01:06:23.402 --> 01:06:26.079
is 200 percent.
 

01:06:26.079 --> 01:06:27.570
So how did I get that?
 

01:06:27.570 --> 01:06:31.983
Just as someone in the front
said the good 2 is much less

01:06:31.983 --> 01:06:32.929
expensive.
 

01:06:32.929 --> 01:06:36.105
The present value of good 2 is
much less than the present value

01:06:36.105 --> 01:06:36.719
of good 1.
 

01:06:36.719 --> 01:06:41.577
People think an apple today is
much more valuable than an apple

01:06:41.577 --> 01:06:42.440
tomorrow.
 

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:45.422
So if you give up an apple
today you can get 3 apples next

01:06:45.422 --> 01:06:45.789
year.
 

01:06:45.789 --> 01:06:49.090
So if you put an apple in the
bank it's like getting 200

01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:50.829
percent interest on apples.
 

01:06:50.829 --> 01:06:53.050
So he called that the real
rate--the apple rate of

01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:53.550
interest.
 

01:06:53.550 --> 01:06:56.570
You put an apple in the bank,
you give up an apple today,

01:06:56.570 --> 01:06:59.295
buy stocks and when it comes
out in the end you've got 200

01:06:59.295 --> 01:07:01.400
percent more apples than you
started with.

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.349
So it's the real rate of
interest.

01:07:04.349 --> 01:07:06.320
So that's his crucial variable.
 

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:09.210
Now, let's go back to the
original equilibrium.

01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:11.889
What is the stock price?
 

01:07:11.889 --> 01:07:17.800
Assume q_1 = 1.
 

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:26.650
What is the stock price
pi_alpha?

01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:30.909
Well, we can figure it out.
 

01:07:30.909 --> 01:07:33.980
How can we figure it out?
 

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:36.530
What is pi_alpha?
 

01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:42.525
Well, stock alpha pays 1 good
tomorrow so what is the price of

01:07:42.525 --> 01:07:44.590
pi_alpha?
 

01:07:44.590 --> 01:07:49.000
Student:
&gt;

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.159
Prof: What?
 

01:07:50.159 --> 01:07:50.869
Somebody said it.
 

01:07:50.869 --> 01:07:53.940
I couldn't hear it--a third.
 

01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:55.679
How did I get a third?
 

01:07:55.679 --> 01:07:58.867
Because we figured out that
once everybody looks through the

01:07:58.867 --> 01:08:00.074
veil,
assuming the price

01:08:00.074 --> 01:08:02.400
P_1 is 1 and the price
q_1 is 1,

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:06.327
if they look through the veil
they're going to say to

01:08:06.327 --> 01:08:09.230
themselves ah-ha,
how much do I have to pay today

01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:10.619
to get an apple in the future?
 

01:08:10.619 --> 01:08:14.010
I have to pay a third to get
one apple in the future.

01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:16.189
P_1 is 3 times
P_2.

01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:18.764
So to get 1 apple in the
future, it's only a third of an

01:08:18.764 --> 01:08:19.420
apple today.
 

01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:23.484
So the stock pays 1 apple in
the future so therefore how much

01:08:23.484 --> 01:08:25.180
do I have to pay today?
 

01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:28.231
I have to pay 1 third of an
apple today, and since I took

01:08:28.231 --> 01:08:31.394
the price of apples to be 1 it's
going to be the price of 1

01:08:31.394 --> 01:08:31.939
third.
 

01:08:31.939 --> 01:08:33.409
So what's the price beta?
 

01:08:33.409 --> 01:08:34.640
Student: 2 thirds.
 

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.149
Prof: 2 thirds.
 

01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:40.657
So Fisher said look,
we've solved now for all these

01:08:40.657 --> 01:08:42.368
financial things.
 

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:54.792
So what you can't do,
Fisher's theory does not

01:08:54.792 --> 01:09:08.869
explain how much of each stock,
theta^(A), etcetera,

01:09:08.869 --> 01:09:15.220
the investors hold.
 

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:16.420
Why is that?
 

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:18.760
Well, because it doesn't matter.
 

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:21.350
Not enough is happening in the
economy yet.

01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:23.399
Alpha and beta are exactly the
same.

01:09:23.399 --> 01:09:26.356
If you own twice as much of the
alpha tree you get exactly the

01:09:26.356 --> 01:09:27.859
same as having the beta tree.
 

01:09:27.859 --> 01:09:31.333
So how can you possibly tell
whether somebody's going to hold

01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:33.939
twice the alpha tree or just one
beta tree?

01:09:33.939 --> 01:09:35.850
Either way he's going to get
the same thing.

01:09:35.850 --> 01:09:38.527
So the theory can't possibly
explain which one they're going

01:09:38.527 --> 01:09:38.890
to do.
 

01:09:38.890 --> 01:09:41.743
Somehow they'll work it out and
divide up the tree so that

01:09:41.743 --> 01:09:44.899
everybody ends up with the right
number of apples in the end.

01:09:44.899 --> 01:09:55.425
And it also does not explain
inflation because you can't tell

01:09:55.425 --> 01:10:01.738
what q_2 is going to
be.

01:10:01.738 --> 01:10:04.454
All right, because you see in
this budget set,

01:10:04.454 --> 01:10:07.230
thanks to that inspired
question, if you double

01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:09.344
q_2,
q_2 appears

01:10:09.344 --> 01:10:11.881
everywhere;
you're not going to change the

01:10:11.881 --> 01:10:12.738
second equation.
 

01:10:12.738 --> 01:10:14.538
So q_2 could be
anything.

01:10:14.538 --> 01:10:18.328
You can double it or triple it,
it won't matter,

01:10:18.328 --> 01:10:21.069
and the same with
q_1.

01:10:21.069 --> 01:10:24.180
It's just like Walras said
before, you can always normalize

01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:25.198
prices to be one.
 

01:10:25.198 --> 01:10:29.213
He had to add another theory of
money and how many dollars were

01:10:29.213 --> 01:10:32.970
floating around in the economy
to explain q_2.

01:10:32.970 --> 01:10:34.479
This theory won't explain it.
 

01:10:34.479 --> 01:10:38.109
So it does not explain
inflation, and it does not

01:10:38.109 --> 01:10:42.646
explain who holds which stock,
and so it does not explain the

01:10:42.646 --> 01:10:44.840
nominal rate of interest.
 

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:48.081
It does not explain i,
the nominal rate of interest,

01:10:48.081 --> 01:10:51.131
because 1 dollar,
who knows what 1 dollar's going

01:10:51.131 --> 01:10:52.149
to be worth.
 

01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:54.340
It depends on how much
inflation we have.

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:57.149
But it does explain the real
rate of interest.

01:10:57.149 --> 01:11:01.500
It does explain r,
and that's the variable that

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:06.228
Fisher said is the one
economists should always pay

01:11:06.228 --> 01:11:10.390
attention to,
the real rate of interest.

01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:13.078
So that's the crucial variable.
 

01:11:13.078 --> 01:11:16.507
So if you want to figure out
what's the price today of a

01:11:16.507 --> 01:11:20.666
stock,
so Fisher's famous equation's

01:11:20.666 --> 01:11:26.376
the price of the stock today,
so pi_alpha divided

01:11:26.376 --> 01:11:29.117
by q_1,
so the real price,

01:11:29.117 --> 01:11:33.154
as somebody said,
the price in terms of goods of

01:11:33.154 --> 01:11:37.940
the stock today is always going
to equal the dividend in the

01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:39.970
future divided by 1 r.
 

01:11:39.970 --> 01:11:40.738
Why is that?
 

01:11:40.738 --> 01:11:43.000
That's exactly what we already
used.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.960
This is just a rewriting of the
trick we did before.

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:51.622
You take the dividend tomorrow,
you multiply it by

01:11:51.622 --> 01:11:56.381
P_2 and then you
realize that 1 r is just

01:11:56.381 --> 01:12:00.569
P_1 divided by
P_2,

01:12:00.569 --> 01:12:03.297
so replacing the P_1s
and P_2s by

01:12:03.297 --> 01:12:06.918
q_1 and 1 r,
today's real stock price is

01:12:06.918 --> 01:12:10.340
just the dividends tomorrow
discounted.

01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:19.265
This is what he called the
Fundamental Theorem of Asset

01:12:19.265 --> 01:12:20.920
Pricing.
 

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:24.645
If you knew the real rate of
interest you'd be able to figure

01:12:24.645 --> 01:12:28.000
out what all the stocks were
worth just like we did.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.649
Once we knew P_1 and
P_2,

01:12:29.649 --> 01:12:32.650
the present value--the present
value prices determine the

01:12:32.650 --> 01:12:35.300
interest rate because they're--
just as we said.

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:36.899
P_1 over
P_2,

01:12:36.899 --> 01:12:37.850
remember, is 1 r.
 

01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:40.855
So knowing P_1 and
P_2 you're always

01:12:40.855 --> 01:12:44.298
normalizing P_1 to be
1, P_2's the same as 1

01:12:44.298 --> 01:12:45.010
over 1 r.
 

01:12:45.010 --> 01:12:48.064
So if you know P_2 or
you know 1 over 1 r,

01:12:48.064 --> 01:12:50.699
you know what the value of the
stocks are.

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:52.770
That's his critical insight.
 

01:12:52.770 --> 01:12:54.439
Now, just to finish...
 

01:12:54.439 --> 01:12:55.500
Yes?
 

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:58.210
Student: That's
q_2 or q_1?

01:12:58.210 --> 01:13:02.029
Prof: q_1,
q_1 which is the same

01:13:02.029 --> 01:13:05.060
as P_1 because it's
today's price.

01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:10.416
The contemporaneous price today
is the present value of the

01:13:10.416 --> 01:13:11.710
price today.
 

01:13:11.710 --> 01:13:15.939
So let me just end on this one
note.

01:13:15.939 --> 01:13:19.179
Fisher said we can take
financial equilibrium without

01:13:19.179 --> 01:13:22.170
uncertainty, reduce it to
general equilibrium.

01:13:22.170 --> 01:13:24.310
We know everything about
general equilibrium,

01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:26.770
therefore we know everything
about financial equilibrium,

01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:29.958
and we realize that the crucial
variable in general equilibrium

01:13:29.958 --> 01:13:31.039
is relative prices.
 

01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:33.510
There is no just interest rate.
 

01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:35.229
The nominal interest rate,
who the hell cares?

01:13:35.229 --> 01:13:37.792
The real interest rate is what
we care about,

01:13:37.792 --> 01:13:41.228
and just in normal economics
there's no just relative price,

01:13:41.228 --> 01:13:43.500
there's no just real interest
rate.

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.319
It depends on people's
utilities.

01:13:46.319 --> 01:13:49.694
You make them more patient and
that's going to affect the real

01:13:49.694 --> 01:13:50.578
interest rate.
 

01:13:50.578 --> 01:13:52.175
You make them less patient it's
going to affect the real

01:13:52.175 --> 01:13:52.640
interest rate.
 

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.555
You give them more endowments
today versus tomorrow,

01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:56.359
that's going to affect the real
interest rate.

01:13:56.359 --> 01:13:58.666
The relative price between
today and tomorrow--that's the

01:13:58.666 --> 01:14:00.189
way you should think about
finance.

01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:02.323
That's the way you should
explain what's going on in the

01:14:02.323 --> 01:14:03.100
financial markets.
 

01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:06.520
So in the problem set you're
just going to do a problem like

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:10.002
that, and then I'm going to give
more interpretations of this

01:14:10.002 --> 01:14:11.220
that Fisher gave.
 

01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:13.600
So I guess I'm out of time,
so we'll stop here.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:19.000

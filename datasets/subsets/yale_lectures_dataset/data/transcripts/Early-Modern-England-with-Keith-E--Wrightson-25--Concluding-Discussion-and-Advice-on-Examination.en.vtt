00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.041
Prof: Okay,
well today we're just winding

00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:05.560
down.
 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.503
First of all,
a few concluding reflections to

00:00:11.503 --> 00:00:14.340
wrap up the course.
 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.420
Well, we've now traced the
development of a society,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.790
of a political culture and
indeed, in many ways,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.410
a whole national culture,
over more than 200 years,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.340
250 years.
 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.252
I promised when we started off
in lecture one that we'd be

00:00:34.252 --> 00:00:36.930
looking at some great
personalities,

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.500
some great events and some
great processes,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.380
and I hope that that promise
has been met.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.533
We've had the great
personalities,

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:52.260
warts and all,
with or without heads.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.455
We've also traced a changing
political culture:

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:59.067
the development of the
institutions of representative

00:00:59.067 --> 00:01:03.103
government;
the eventual taming of personal

00:01:03.103 --> 00:01:06.507
monarchy;
the development of concepts of

00:01:06.507 --> 00:01:10.001
the rule of law,
of political participation,

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:13.170
of notions of liberty under the
law.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.409
We've also looked at the
emergence,

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.531
the early stages of the
emergence, of a fully capitalist

00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:23.503
market economy,
and indeed its connections to a

00:01:23.503 --> 00:01:25.450
nascent world economy.
 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.049
And we've looked at the
transition from a late medieval

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.905
society of orders to what can
reasonably be described as a

00:01:34.905 --> 00:01:37.120
nascent class society.
 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.739
We've looked at a
transformation in religious

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:45.677
culture, the eventual acceptance
of a tentative pluralism and

00:01:45.677 --> 00:01:48.640
toleration in matters of belief.
 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.403
And of course we've looked at
enormous changes in levels of

00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:56.037
education, in popular literacy
and the print culture that

00:01:56.037 --> 00:01:57.790
served these and so on.
 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.584
And throughout all of this,
in many ways,

00:02:00.584 --> 00:02:04.635
we've looked at the hammering
out of the conflicts to which

00:02:04.635 --> 00:02:07.218
all of these processes gave
rise.

00:02:07.218 --> 00:02:11.463
And eventually,
the finding of ways to deal

00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:14.800
with those conflicts peaceably.
 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.740
Well, these are things of some
significance.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.436
They matter,
most obviously,

00:02:20.436 --> 00:02:24.269
to the extent that some of the
events and processes that we've

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.102
been examining in this period
have left a legacy in the modern

00:02:28.102 --> 00:02:33.098
world in terms of institutions,
in terms of values,

00:02:33.098 --> 00:02:35.710
in terms of ideas.
 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.270
And that's not just true of
England or Britain,

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.696
but also of a larger world that
at one time or another was

00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:47.568
subject to British influence,
firsthand or at secondhand.

00:02:47.568 --> 00:02:50.397
To that extent,
many of these things are a

00:02:50.397 --> 00:02:54.330
widely shared legacy and worth
knowing something about.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.466
They are, in the words of one
Tudor chronicler,

00:02:58.466 --> 00:03:03.681
in his definition of history,
they're "tales useful to

00:03:03.681 --> 00:03:05.389
be known."
 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:09.591
And all that is one form of
what Peter Laslett,

00:03:09.591 --> 00:03:12.604
in his famous phrase,
described as

00:03:12.604 --> 00:03:16.990
"understanding ourselves in
time."

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.340
But when he used that phrase,
he also meant something larger.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.359
He meant reflecting on the
actual nature of the historical

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:27.240
process.
 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.323
Now, of course one can do that
for any period of history for

00:03:32.323 --> 00:03:36.364
any country;
they're all equally valuable as

00:03:36.364 --> 00:03:40.294
human experience,
though the stories and the

00:03:40.294 --> 00:03:41.848
meanings vary.
 

00:03:41.848 --> 00:03:46.739
We've looked at one particular
case, but it also serves to

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.057
illustrate some general points
about the historical process and

00:03:52.057 --> 00:03:54.460
I'll raise them briefly.
 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:00.639
First, of course,
history is process.

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:06.128
We're looking at societies
which are in constant motion.

00:04:06.128 --> 00:04:09.408
Change is the heart of the
matter.

00:04:09.408 --> 00:04:12.363
People change,
societies and their

00:04:12.363 --> 00:04:15.943
institutions change,
their values change,

00:04:15.943 --> 00:04:18.449
their identities change.
 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:23.141
An outline course of this kind
helps to reveal that,

00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:27.742
and early modern England
certainly illustrates that

00:04:27.742 --> 00:04:29.399
general truth.
 

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:33.790
It was a time obviously enough
of the breaking of worlds and of

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.370
the making of worlds,
of the erosion of old

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.310
certainties and identities and
structures,

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.569
and the creation of new ones.
 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:51.322
But secondly,
historical change of this kind

00:04:51.322 --> 00:04:52.540
is messy.
 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.331
It's complex and messy and,
in many ways,

00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:58.769
ambiguous.
 

00:04:58.769 --> 00:05:02.730
History is never scripted in
advance.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.177
Historians who have an
ideological cast of mind might

00:05:06.177 --> 00:05:10.290
like to pretend that it is and
to describe historical processes

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.540
as though they have a certain
inevitability,

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.670
leading to preconceived ends of
one kind or another.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.220
But they deceive themselves.
 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.009
Nothing in history is
pre-ordained.

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:28.461
Some change may be the
successful outcome of

00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:33.663
deliberately planned action,
but a great deal is the result

00:05:33.663 --> 00:05:38.370
of improvised responses to
immediate contingencies.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.360
And in both cases,
there are always the unforeseen

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.889
consequences.
 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.180
The history of early modern
England illustrates this well

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.709
enough.
 

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:51.779
Think of the Henrician
Reformation,

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:56.490
or think of the regicide and
what followed it,

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.598
or think of the long working
out of the outcome of the

00:06:02.598 --> 00:06:05.019
Revolution of 1688.
 

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:09.257
So it's not scripted in advance
and it's not synchronized

00:06:09.257 --> 00:06:09.939
either.
 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:14.670
Change of different kinds
proceeds at different paces.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.045
We've looked at political
change, economic change,

00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:20.319
social change,
cultural change.

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:24.668
We've seen the urgency with
which political change can often

00:06:24.668 --> 00:06:27.923
take place,
but then there are also those

00:06:27.923 --> 00:06:30.990
processes which are of a very
gradual,

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.742
very slow and cumulative
nature, worked out over

00:06:35.742 --> 00:06:40.899
generations and uneven in their
long-term impact.

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:44.007
Think of the uneven spread of
literacy, for example,

00:06:44.007 --> 00:06:47.420
or the process of economic
change that I've looked at.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.000
As a result,
at any one point in time,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.324
any society is a kind of
mixture of forms because change

00:06:56.324 --> 00:06:59.810
is uneven, because it's partial.
 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.882
So, the process is messy,
but nonetheless,

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:08.850
in all of this one can find
patterns, one can trace

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.439
connections.
 

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:14.077
If it wasn't so,
one would not be able to offer

00:07:14.077 --> 00:07:17.480
interpretations of the process
of change.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.095
One wouldn't be able to offer
arguments about the nature of

00:07:22.095 --> 00:07:23.050
causation.
 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.641
And again, looking at a
particular society over a long

00:07:26.641 --> 00:07:30.435
period of time helps one to
appreciate this aspect of the

00:07:30.435 --> 00:07:31.860
study of history.
 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.360
It reveals the interconnections.
 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:41.170
It reveals the way things work
their way through over time.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.322
But no single interpretation
ever encompasses it all,

00:07:44.322 --> 00:07:45.050
of course.
 

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.350
No single interpretation ever
holds all the answers.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.214
How can one simply answer a
question like,

00:07:52.214 --> 00:07:55.639
"When did England become
Protestant?"

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:59.800
And what did that mean, anyway?
 

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.240
That's why, of course,
we constantly need to revise

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.819
our views of it all in the light
of new evidence,

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:11.163
in the light of new imaginative
insights on the part of

00:08:11.163 --> 00:08:12.209
historians.
 

00:08:12.209 --> 00:08:14.959
We can never wholly recover the
past;

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:19.189
it's gone, it's drowned in time.
 

00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:24.759
But we can enter a dialog with
the evidence that it has left

00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:26.839
and,
by doing that,

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:31.810
remake the past again and again
in the present,

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:36.158
according to our changing
preoccupations and our changing

00:08:36.158 --> 00:08:37.480
understandings.
 

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.226
Finding new dimensions of what
was going on,

00:08:41.226 --> 00:08:45.831
previously neglected;
finding new meanings,

00:08:45.831 --> 00:08:48.308
new understandings.
 

00:08:48.308 --> 00:08:53.129
And this is very evident in the
ongoing debates over all the

00:08:53.129 --> 00:08:56.558
major issues of this particular
period,

00:08:56.558 --> 00:09:01.580
and the way that new issues are
constantly emerging.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:06.414
Well, it's because of that
complexity that I've tried to

00:09:06.414 --> 00:09:11.866
present an account of change in
this period that is complex and

00:09:11.866 --> 00:09:15.408
many faceted,
that includes many dimensions;

00:09:15.408 --> 00:09:16.732
the political,
the economic,

00:09:16.732 --> 00:09:18.296
the social,
the cultural,

00:09:18.296 --> 00:09:21.870
each of them making its own
contribution to an overall

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.780
process,
each of them helping to make

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.769
the overall process
comprehensible.

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:32.754
And it's because of the
ambiguities in all of this that

00:09:32.754 --> 00:09:35.408
I've tried to adopt a variety of
perspectives;

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:38.768
looking at things from the
Catholic point of view and from

00:09:38.768 --> 00:09:41.712
the Protestant point of view,
from the monarchical,

00:09:41.712 --> 00:09:45.359
from the populist;
history as viewed from the top,

00:09:45.359 --> 00:09:48.389
or from the bottom,
or from the middle;

00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:54.320
history wearing breeches,
history dressed in a gown.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.500
And there's a point to all of
this;

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:02.567
the point is simply that
history contains many stories,

00:10:02.567 --> 00:10:05.759
all of which deserve to be
told.

00:10:05.759 --> 00:10:09.373
It contains,
in the evidence it leaves to

00:10:09.373 --> 00:10:13.166
us, many voices,
all of which deserve to be

00:10:13.166 --> 00:10:14.070
heard.
 

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:19.658
No one owns the past;
it's common land.

00:10:19.658 --> 00:10:23.330
There's no velvet rope denying
access.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.590
It's not a gated community.
 

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:30.610
The dead, in the evidence they
leave to us, will talk to

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:31.269
anyone.
 

00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:36.408
They're very nice that way.
 

00:10:36.408 --> 00:10:40.529
I've also tried repeatedly to
give a sense of the context

00:10:40.529 --> 00:10:44.206
within which people lived,
made their decisions and

00:10:44.206 --> 00:10:45.899
choices, and acted.
 

00:10:45.899 --> 00:10:49.724
And again, there's a very
simple historical philosophy

00:10:49.724 --> 00:10:53.693
behind that which is neatly
stated in the old adage that

00:10:53.693 --> 00:10:59.212
people make their own history,
but they don't make it just as

00:10:59.212 --> 00:11:00.509
they choose.
 

00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:04.525
They make it within contexts
and under conditions that are

00:11:04.525 --> 00:11:08.351
not of their own choosing;
some of which are inherited,

00:11:08.351 --> 00:11:11.860
some of which are newly
encountered, some of which can

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.572
be anticipated,
some of which take them by

00:11:14.572 --> 00:11:15.500
surprise.
 

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:20.524
But by their actions and
responses and choices,

00:11:20.524 --> 00:11:26.642
they can change their world,
though always within certain

00:11:26.642 --> 00:11:28.389
constraints.
 

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:31.649
And to understand that process
and the outcomes,

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:35.191
we need to understand the
context within which people

00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:39.336
acted in their own time,
in their own ways,

00:11:39.336 --> 00:11:43.308
according to their own lights.
 

00:11:43.308 --> 00:11:48.057
One of the most important of
such contexts is of course the

00:11:48.057 --> 00:11:52.722
structures of power in any
society, in determining action,

00:11:52.722 --> 00:11:54.769
in initiating change.
 

00:11:54.769 --> 00:12:00.110
Some people carried more
weight, some had more clout;

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:04.284
we've seen examples enough of
that in early modern England in

00:12:04.284 --> 00:12:07.554
the political sphere,
in the economic sphere and

00:12:07.554 --> 00:12:08.528
elsewhere.
 

00:12:08.528 --> 00:12:13.440
But we've seen examples too of
the fact that power can be

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:18.261
resisted, it can be confronted,
it can even be put under

00:12:18.261 --> 00:12:19.490
restraint.
 

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:24.879
People make their own history,
they can alter the contexts,

00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:28.610
sometimes quite significantly,
reshaping the world that is

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:31.100
encountered by the next
generation,

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:36.033
and that in a sense has been
the core of the narrative

00:12:36.033 --> 00:12:38.360
element of this course.
 

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.849
So to conclude:
things change,

00:12:40.849 --> 00:12:44.501
change is messy,
it's ambiguous in its meaning,

00:12:44.501 --> 00:12:47.200
there are many interconnected
stories,

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.860
history has many voices,
people make their own history,

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.202
but not just as they please,
and if some have more power

00:12:54.202 --> 00:12:58.070
than others to call the shots,
they don't have to have it all

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:01.720
their own way;
nor did they.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:07.211
Reflecting on the process as a
whole gives the history of any

00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:10.690
period and any country its
meaning,

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:15.567
its many meanings,
and that's why it's worth

00:13:15.567 --> 00:13:16.928
bothering.
 

00:13:16.928 --> 00:13:20.979
In studying history,
we constantly reconstruct the

00:13:20.979 --> 00:13:25.317
past in the present,
disciplined as we do it by

00:13:25.317 --> 00:13:29.908
respect for the evidence which
it leaves to us,

00:13:29.908 --> 00:13:36.019
but drawn in to examine and to
re-examine that evidence by the

00:13:36.019 --> 00:13:41.830
problems which we ourselves feel
the need to understand.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:44.788
Each of us is drawn,
almost instinctively,

00:13:44.788 --> 00:13:49.447
to those aspects of the past
which continue to resonate to us

00:13:49.447 --> 00:13:53.639
individually across the
centuries because they speak to

00:13:53.639 --> 00:13:58.220
us for reasons we sometimes
might not fully understand.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.361
They speak to our
preoccupations,

00:14:01.361 --> 00:14:04.210
they speak to our dilemmas.
 

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:09.413
And in trying to understand
them, we can not only understand

00:14:09.413 --> 00:14:14.265
ourselves better in time,
but also see possibilities for

00:14:14.265 --> 00:14:15.590
the future.
 

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:23.177
Historical events can often be
dismaying, but historical study

00:14:23.177 --> 00:14:29.832
is ultimately encouraging;
it's concerned with change,

00:14:29.832 --> 00:14:33.711
with possibility,
with adaptation,

00:14:33.711 --> 00:14:36.178
with finding ways.
 

00:14:36.178 --> 00:14:41.014
It's concerned with human
experience and achievement of

00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:42.178
every kind.
 

00:14:42.178 --> 00:14:47.339
Sustaining a sense of that
ancestry is important in what

00:14:47.339 --> 00:14:52.967
sometimes seems an increasingly
frivolous and de-historicized

00:14:52.967 --> 00:14:57.940
Western culture with an
extremely shallow awareness of

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:03.850
its own past that can result in
a kind of disorientation.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:08.980
History, in contrast,
tries to understand;

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:14.144
to understand what we have
been, to raise questions and

00:15:14.144 --> 00:15:19.785
suggestions and implications for
what we might be capable of

00:15:19.785 --> 00:15:21.028
becoming.
 

00:15:21.028 --> 00:15:25.214
And that's why history,
all history,

00:15:25.214 --> 00:15:26.409
matters.
 

00:15:26.409 --> 00:15:32.428
It really does matter.
 

00:15:32.428 --> 00:15:38.634
Okay, well that's my little
sermon, and now we're going to

00:15:38.634 --> 00:15:44.402
have a short awards ceremony,
for which I must prepare

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:45.600
myself.
 

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:53.909
&gt;
 

00:15:53.909 --> 00:15:55.080
Right.
 

00:15:55.080 --> 00:16:01.490
&gt;
 

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:07.759
I hereby declare myself Supreme
Head of the History Department.

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:12.950
Henceforward only my
interpretations will be taught,

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.614
and henceforward,
all books published by members

00:16:15.614 --> 00:16:19.129
of the Department will contain a
groveling dedication to me.

00:16:19.129 --> 00:16:22.570
&gt;
 

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:28.299
But even the most horrid tyrant
cannot rule alone.

00:16:28.299 --> 00:16:30.019
You need an aristocracy.
 

00:16:30.019 --> 00:16:31.500
&gt;
 

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.668
And aristocracies,
as you know,

00:16:33.668 --> 00:16:35.259
need to be rewarded.
 

00:16:35.259 --> 00:16:39.668
And so we have an awards
ceremony to reward our teaching

00:16:39.668 --> 00:16:42.664
fellows;
the russet-coated captains of

00:16:42.664 --> 00:16:47.054
this course who (laughs) know
what they teach and love what

00:16:47.054 --> 00:16:48.038
they know.
 

00:16:48.038 --> 00:16:51.447
Okay, now I have some
nominations for these awards

00:16:51.447 --> 00:16:54.370
here prepared for me by Thomas
Cromwell.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.850
&gt;
 

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:58.480
Right.
 

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.389
Now, first of all,
what do we have here?

00:17:01.389 --> 00:17:03.120
Yes, okay.
 

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:09.604
We have the Henry VIII Award
for Devotion to Family Values

00:17:09.604 --> 00:17:12.789
and for being top redhead.
 

00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:14.288
&gt;
 

00:17:14.288 --> 00:17:18.537
Student: 
&gt;

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:23.680
 Oh, thank you
&gt;

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.501
It's a divorced,
beheaded, died,

00:17:25.501 --> 00:17:27.384
divorced, beheaded,
survived bag,

00:17:27.384 --> 00:17:30.559
which I will use for my library
books for my work.

00:17:30.559 --> 00:17:31.608
Keith Wrightson:  Okay.
 

00:17:31.608 --> 00:17:37.210
And now we have the Elizabeth I
Award for Not Making Windows

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:43.190
into Students' Souls and for
Keeping Advisors in their Place.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.980
&lt;&lt;Laughter and
applause&gt;&gt;

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.319
And looking ahead to the Stuart
Succession which I've done my

00:17:51.319 --> 00:17:53.875
best to avoid,
but unfortunately it's going to

00:17:53.875 --> 00:17:56.722
happen,
so my soothsayers tell me,

00:17:56.722 --> 00:18:00.230
we have the King Charles II
Award --

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:05.528
the last real king -- the King
Charles II Award for Being Tall,

00:18:05.528 --> 00:18:10.880
Dark and Partly French --
&gt;

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.029
 -- and for staying cool
and carrying on.

00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:15.869
To Justin DuRivage.
 

00:18:15.869 --> 00:18:22.049
&gt;
 

00:18:22.049 --> 00:18:22.670
Okay.
 

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.059
So that's it.
 

00:18:24.059 --> 00:18:26.960
&gt;
 

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.191
Do remember to let me know if
you intend to come to the Center

00:18:31.191 --> 00:18:35.631
for British Art tomorrow morning
for the last visit there and now

00:18:35.631 --> 00:18:39.307
we'll turn to housekeeping
matters and I'll tell you a

00:18:39.307 --> 00:18:42.500
little bit about the nature of
the exam.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:48.000

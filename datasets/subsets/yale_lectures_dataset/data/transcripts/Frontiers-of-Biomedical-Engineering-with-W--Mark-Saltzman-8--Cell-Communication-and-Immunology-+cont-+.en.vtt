00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.963
Professor Mark Saltzman:
Okay, today we're going to

00:00:14.963 --> 00:00:16.610
continue to talk about cell
communication.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.604
I'm going to talk about - take
sort of the general concepts

00:00:20.604 --> 00:00:24.874
that we talked about last time
and talk about how they apply in

00:00:24.874 --> 00:00:28.873
two physiological systems,
the nervous system first and

00:00:28.873 --> 00:00:33.010
then the immune system.
This is a lead in to what we'll

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.068
talk about next week.
We're going to start talking

00:00:37.068 --> 00:00:41.746
about vaccines which is really
sort of applied immunology:

00:00:41.746 --> 00:00:46.178
trying to take immunological
concepts and put them into

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:49.790
action or to engineer them in
some way.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.620
So, we'll talk about that next
time.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.980
I want to start with the
nervous system.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.978
This is a picture of a neuron,
this particular neuron has been

00:01:03.978 --> 00:01:09.780
filled with a fluorescent dye so
that it's colored green.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.523
I'm using it just to make the
point, which you already know

00:01:13.523 --> 00:01:16.876
about;
that the nervous system is

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:22.439
complex in it performs a complex
set of functions.

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.449
It's able to do that because
there are cells like this

00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:30.686
particular cell that have shapes
that are suited to their

00:01:30.686 --> 00:01:33.599
function.
In this case the shape is -

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:37.743
there's a cell body in the
center here so this is where the

00:01:37.743 --> 00:01:41.030
nucleus is and where all the
transcription,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.590
production of proteins take
place here.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.409
Then around this cell body
there's an elaborate set of

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.651
processes which extend out from
the cell body,

00:01:50.651 --> 00:01:53.390
and they go in various
directions.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.858
If you look throughout the
nervous system you would find

00:01:56.858 --> 00:01:59.739
cells that look different in
different regions,

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:02.250
because of where they're
situated in the brain.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.377
But they'd all have some of
these same features,

00:02:05.377 --> 00:02:09.371
that is a cell body with many
processes that meet in the cell

00:02:09.371 --> 00:02:12.502
body.
Now, what this enables these

00:02:12.502 --> 00:02:18.019
cells to do is to communicate
with very specific other regions

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.200
of the nervous system.
So this cell,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.530
wherever it's setting,
wherever it is positioned

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.072
within the nervous system -
let's say in the cortex

00:02:28.072 --> 00:02:32.110
somewhere or the outside surface
of the brain - is able to

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.139
communicate with a region of the
brain that's in this direction,

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:39.378
a region in this direction,
a region in this direction,

00:02:39.378 --> 00:02:42.481
a region in this direction.
So one way that neurons,

00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:45.808
in particular,
are able to communicate with

00:02:45.808 --> 00:02:48.740
other cells in the nervous
system,

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.602
share information,
integrate information,

00:02:51.602 --> 00:02:56.039
decide what to do next is that
they are physically connected to

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:59.848
other different cells.
Part of the complexity of the

00:02:59.848 --> 00:03:03.745
nervous system is the complexity
of this interconnection of

00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:06.373
cells.
Now, if we look at this

00:03:06.373 --> 00:03:09.969
schematically and so again this
is a schematic.

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:13.857
It doesn't represent any
particular neuron in the body,

00:03:13.857 --> 00:03:18.319
but just meant to represent
functions that all of them have.

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.840
Here is the cell body up at the
top of the diagram here.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.920
You could distinguish between
some properties of these

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.155
processes that extend out,
in that most of them are what

00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:34.541
are called dendrites.
One of these processes,

00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:38.180
a special one is called the
axon.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.947
The way this cell works as an
information processing unit is

00:03:43.947 --> 00:03:48.427
that the dendrites,
which extend out in all these

00:03:48.427 --> 00:03:52.697
different directions,
are receiving information from

00:03:52.697 --> 00:03:57.552
other cells which is integrated
at the position of the cell

00:03:57.552 --> 00:04:00.613
body.
Then that information - that

00:04:00.613 --> 00:04:05.297
integrated information - is
passed onto another cell through

00:04:05.297 --> 00:04:08.905
the axon.
Information flows from the

00:04:08.905 --> 00:04:13.909
dendrites, through the cell
body, down the axon.

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:19.523
That's what this arrow at the
right shows, the direction of

00:04:19.523 --> 00:04:23.961
the flow of information.
We're going to talk in some

00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:28.515
detail, not a very high level of
detail, but in some detail about

00:04:28.515 --> 00:04:32.713
how this communication takes
place between cells and how the

00:04:32.713 --> 00:04:36.769
information is passed down one
of these cells today.

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:42.303
Some terminology,
some of which I've already

00:04:42.303 --> 00:04:47.129
given you: cell body,
dendrites, axons.

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:53.166
If this is the particular kind
of axon that is 'myelinated',

00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:59.509
then it might have a layer of a
special substance called myelin

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.980
in sheathing the axon.
That just allows information to

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.310
move more quickly from one end
of the cell to the other.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.727
That can be important because
in some cases these processes

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:13.443
are very long.
There are processes that go

00:05:13.443 --> 00:05:16.858
from my nervous system,
from my brain and spinal cord

00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:20.667
out to the tips of my fingers
that allow me to move muscles

00:05:20.667 --> 00:05:22.600
there,
or down to your toes.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.087
So, these cells can be many,
many feet long,

00:05:25.087 --> 00:05:26.360
these processes can.

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:33.973
Well, the mechanism that
the cell uses to transmit

00:05:33.973 --> 00:05:38.061
information along itself,
along this process which goes

00:05:38.061 --> 00:05:41.057
from my brain to my fingers,
for example,

00:05:41.057 --> 00:05:45.699
is through an electrical signal
called an action potential.

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.283
We're not going to talk about
this is in great detail,

00:05:48.283 --> 00:05:49.990
there's some detail in your
book.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.010
If you go on to take,
particularly the course that's

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.480
offered here called
Physiological Systems,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.061
you'll learn a lot about action
potentials and what the

00:06:00.061 --> 00:06:01.829
mechanisms for generating them
are,

00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:08.759
but I'm only going to say a few
words here to sort of orient you

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:16.768
in the subject.
All membranes are electrically

00:06:16.768 --> 00:06:20.426
charged.
They carry a potential,

00:06:20.426 --> 00:06:24.929
that is, if you could - if you
had a tiny, tiny electrical

00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:27.129
meter,
you could one put one electrode

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:29.675
on one side of the cell
membrane, on the extracellular

00:06:29.675 --> 00:06:32.269
side and one on the
intracellular side and measure,

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:34.540
you would measure a potential
difference;

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.480
just like a battery you would
measure a potential difference.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.505
That potential difference is
generated by the movement of

00:06:42.505 --> 00:06:46.889
ions, principally sodium and
potassium across the membrane.

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:49.983
Now, sodium and potassium don't
ordinarily move across

00:06:49.983 --> 00:06:52.259
membranes, they're charged
molecules,

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:55.023
they can't dissolve,
they can't permeate through a

00:06:55.023 --> 00:06:57.335
cell membrane,
but they go through because

00:06:57.335 --> 00:07:00.494
there are channels that allow
them to pass through in the

00:07:00.494 --> 00:07:02.955
membrane.
All cell membranes have

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:05.948
these channels within them,
and under their resting

00:07:05.948 --> 00:07:09.180
conditions sodium is moving from
outside to inside,

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.230
potassium's moving from inside
to outside.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.836
Because there are ions moving
back and forth,

00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:20.098
there's a current that flows
and there's a electrical

00:07:20.098 --> 00:07:24.219
potential that's generated.
Now, this is in the resting

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:27.145
state of all cells,
there's some membrane potential

00:07:27.145 --> 00:07:30.480
and neurons have this resting
membrane potential also.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:38.064
If you measured it for most
cells it's about between -60 and

00:07:38.064 --> 00:07:42.461
-90 millivolts.
For this particular cell here

00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:47.036
it looks like it's about -75
millivolts, so the inside of the

00:07:47.036 --> 00:07:51.230
cell is a little bit more
negative than the outside.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:56.919
Now, what happens during an
action potential is that that

00:07:56.919 --> 00:08:02.303
membrane potential changes
rapidly and it changes from

00:08:02.303 --> 00:08:06.569
being negative to being more
positive.

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:11.377
That change happens because
something gets triggered in the

00:08:11.377 --> 00:08:15.604
membrane, and what gets
triggered is a voltage gated

00:08:15.604 --> 00:08:18.920
sodium channel,
which is shown here.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.003
Now, remember we talked
about these last time,

00:08:22.003 --> 00:08:25.465
voltage-gated channels are
channels that would allow the

00:08:25.465 --> 00:08:27.673
passage of sodium,
in this case,

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:31.093
but they can exist in two
states, a closed state and an

00:08:31.093 --> 00:08:34.211
open state.
When an action potential is

00:08:34.211 --> 00:08:39.417
initiated these ion channels go
from their closed state to their

00:08:39.417 --> 00:08:44.210
open state, when they open
sodium can now pass through.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.475
The balance of sodium movement
relative to potassium movement

00:08:48.475 --> 00:08:52.527
changes because there's this
resting movement of all these

00:08:52.527 --> 00:08:55.916
molecules anyway,
but that balance changes

00:08:55.916 --> 00:09:00.498
dramatically when these ion -
when these gated ion channels

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:03.600
open.
That results in a dramatic

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.151
change in the membrane voltage;
the potential across the

00:09:08.151 --> 00:09:11.931
membrane and that's shown here
by this rapid rise in membrane

00:09:11.931 --> 00:09:14.750
potential.
Now, that rapid rise is

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.900
called depolarization and the
membrane is said to be in a

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.753
depolarized state because it's
less polarized or less

00:09:22.753 --> 00:09:27.200
negatively charged - repolarized
as negatively charged.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.820
It's less negatively charged
than it is in its resting state.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.547
That happens,
and if I was looking at a

00:09:35.547 --> 00:09:39.782
region of membrane that was
experiencing an action potential

00:09:39.782 --> 00:09:44.089
I would see voltage change in
just the way it's shown in this

00:09:44.089 --> 00:09:47.915
graph here.
Now, if that potential changed

00:09:47.915 --> 00:09:52.951
and it stayed changed forever,
then the cell would never go

00:09:52.951 --> 00:09:56.958
back to its resting state.
That would be - you could have

00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.837
a cell that did that but that
would be cell that could only

00:09:59.837 --> 00:10:02.560
send one signal.
It sends it's signal,

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.225
it's signal - the signal that
it sends is this change in

00:10:07.225 --> 00:10:11.720
voltage, and once it changes,
maybe it's all done.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.231
That would be a bad design for
our nervous system where we want

00:10:14.231 --> 00:10:15.649
to use cells over and over
again,

00:10:15.649 --> 00:10:18.470
so they're able to recover from
this change in potential.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:23.375
That's shown functionally here
but recovery means that this

00:10:23.375 --> 00:10:26.590
sodium channel becomes closed
again.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.388
Now, it's more complicated
than that because it's not just

00:10:29.388 --> 00:10:31.039
sodium channels that are
involved,

00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:35.047
there are potassium channels
also, and the interplay between

00:10:35.047 --> 00:10:38.919
sodium channels opening and
potassium channels opening,

00:10:38.919 --> 00:10:40.980
this is described in some
detail in your book.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.720
We're not going to talk about
those details in the class here;

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.115
I want you to sort of
understand this really at the

00:10:46.115 --> 00:10:47.840
level that I've described it
here.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.692
There's a local change in the
membrane, that local change

00:10:51.692 --> 00:10:55.752
involves opening of channels
that allow ions to pass through

00:10:55.752 --> 00:10:59.330
regions where they couldn't pass
through before,

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.840
that results in a change in
voltage.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:07.649
That voltage moves from one end
of the cell to the other.

00:11:07.649 --> 00:11:13.208
That action potential is
initiated here up in this

00:11:13.208 --> 00:11:16.978
region.
This part of the cell becomes

00:11:16.978 --> 00:11:22.665
depolarized because it gets the
message that it's supposed to

00:11:22.665 --> 00:11:28.068
depolarize because of all the
inputs that impinge on these

00:11:28.068 --> 00:11:31.067
dendrites.
It's collecting information

00:11:31.067 --> 00:11:34.631
from all these dendrites under
the right series of signals the

00:11:34.631 --> 00:11:37.259
cell body integrates all that
information,

00:11:37.259 --> 00:11:39.590
says time for me to fire an
action potential.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:42.803
That happens,
the membrane potential changes

00:11:42.803 --> 00:11:47.362
here, and the change in membrane
potential here is so dramatic

00:11:47.362 --> 00:11:50.950
that it changes the membrane
potential here,

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:54.133
and here, and here,
and that change of potential

00:11:54.133 --> 00:11:56.639
flows down the surface of the
axon,

00:11:56.639 --> 00:12:01.509
eventually reaching this output
region.

00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:06.711
The flow of information is
really a flow of electrical

00:12:06.711 --> 00:12:10.909
potential and it goes in one
direction only.

00:12:10.909 --> 00:12:14.715
It goes from the region of the
cell where the dendrites are

00:12:14.715 --> 00:12:17.735
down through the axon.
We're going to come back and

00:12:17.735 --> 00:12:20.883
talk about the action potential
a little bit more when we talk

00:12:20.883 --> 00:12:25.018
about how the heart works,
because the heart when its

00:12:25.018 --> 00:12:30.904
contracting, the muscle cells
also use action potentials to

00:12:30.904 --> 00:12:35.899
initiate contraction.
When we measure EKG's,

00:12:35.899 --> 00:12:42.180
what we're measuring is the
activity of all these cells

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:47.879
within our heart performing
action potentials.

00:12:47.879 --> 00:12:52.329
Now, in the heart action
potential is moving from one

00:12:52.329 --> 00:12:57.549
heart muscle cell to another
over the surface of the heart.

00:12:57.549 --> 00:13:01.072
In the brain,
action potentials are moving

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:04.938
down processes,
down a single cell process for

00:13:04.938 --> 00:13:08.029
example.
So action potentials are used

00:13:08.029 --> 00:13:12.291
by tissues in different ways to
send signals from one cell to

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:16.980
another or from one end of one
cell to another end of the cell.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.592
Does that make sense?
We'll come back to this in our

00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:25.018
example in the cardiovascular
system when we're talking about

00:13:25.018 --> 00:13:28.387
the heart and we'll talk about
how to measure the collective

00:13:28.387 --> 00:13:30.899
group of action potentials using
EKG's.

00:13:30.899 --> 00:13:35.403
You'll actually get to measure
EKG's on each other during

00:13:35.403 --> 00:13:38.460
section the week we talk about
that.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.839
Well, what happens when the
signal gets to the end of the

00:13:42.839 --> 00:13:47.030
axon?
How do cells pass the signal

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:51.500
from themselves to the next
cell?

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.942
In the heart it turns out that
the cells of the heart are

00:13:54.942 --> 00:13:59.526
electrically coupled together,
so if an action potential moves

00:13:59.526 --> 00:14:04.000
down this cell it directly moves
into the next cell.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.495
So, there's a continuum of
electrical connection in the

00:14:07.495 --> 00:14:11.120
heart that allows an action
potential to sweep across the

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:15.133
surface of the heart and for the
heart to beat in a coordinated

00:14:15.133 --> 00:14:17.285
fashion.
In the nervous system it

00:14:17.285 --> 00:14:20.953
doesn't work that way.
It doesn't work that way for a

00:14:20.953 --> 00:14:25.077
variety of reasons,
but the main reason is that you

00:14:25.077 --> 00:14:30.519
want some decisions to be made
at each space between two cells.

00:14:30.519 --> 00:14:34.387
You want decisions to be made
there so you need some

00:14:34.387 --> 00:14:38.557
additional mechanism for
decision making at the point of

00:14:38.557 --> 00:14:42.728
contact between the axon of one
cell and the dendrite of

00:14:42.728 --> 00:14:45.169
another.
Well, that specialized

00:14:45.169 --> 00:14:48.195
region - now in this diagram
here, this is the axon of one

00:14:48.195 --> 00:14:51.169
cell,
the first cell in a sequence

00:14:51.169 --> 00:14:56.631
and that axon meets the dendrite
of another cell at a special

00:14:56.631 --> 00:15:01.310
region called a synapse.
The synapse is just this

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:06.584
anatomical region of contact
between two adjacent cells in

00:15:06.584 --> 00:15:10.993
the nervous system.
It varies in its structure

00:15:10.993 --> 00:15:15.922
among cells of the nervous
system but all synapses have

00:15:15.922 --> 00:15:20.582
some properties in common.
One is that there's a physical

00:15:20.582 --> 00:15:24.539
space in between the two cells,
so the axon of what's called

00:15:24.539 --> 00:15:29.264
the pre-synaptic neuron,
or the neuron that's bringing a

00:15:29.264 --> 00:15:34.436
signal into the synapse,
the axon terminal is physically

00:15:34.436 --> 00:15:38.950
separated from the dendrite of
the next cell.

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:43.390
That space is about 20 to 40
nanometers, it's not a very big

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:46.250
space, but it's a significant
space.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.506
It's called the synaptic cleft
and it's filled with

00:15:49.506 --> 00:15:52.154
extracellular fluid.
Now, another thing that

00:15:52.154 --> 00:15:54.809
you'd find if you looked inside
the axon terminals of any of

00:15:54.809 --> 00:15:58.269
these pre-synaptic membranes,
you'd find lots of vesicles or

00:15:58.269 --> 00:16:02.444
some membrane bound compartments
that contain special chemicals

00:16:02.444 --> 00:16:06.721
called neurotransmitters.
Neurotransmitters are molecules

00:16:06.721 --> 00:16:09.344
you've heard of like
acetylcholine,

00:16:09.344 --> 00:16:11.889
like dopamine,
like serotonin.

00:16:11.889 --> 00:16:16.941
They're small molecules that -
whose principal function in the

00:16:16.941 --> 00:16:21.827
body is to carry signals from
one cell in the nervous system

00:16:21.827 --> 00:16:24.966
to another.
Now, how they carry signals is

00:16:24.966 --> 00:16:27.809
that these neurotransmitters act
as ligands.

00:16:27.809 --> 00:16:33.124
When an action potential comes
down this pre-synaptic axon,

00:16:33.124 --> 00:16:36.240
when it reaches this point
here,

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:41.192
it sets off the process of
these vesicles dumping their

00:16:41.192 --> 00:16:45.550
content into the synaptic cleft.
This process,

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:49.783
which is shown schematically
here, as a vesicle fusing with

00:16:49.783 --> 00:16:53.798
the cell membrane and then
dropping its neurotransmitter

00:16:53.798 --> 00:16:58.104
only happens when an action
potential reaches the end of the

00:16:58.104 --> 00:17:01.611
axon.
Neurotransmitter release is

00:17:01.611 --> 00:17:07.460
stimulated by the electrical
activity that reaches the end of

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:11.424
the axon.
When these vesicles dump their

00:17:11.424 --> 00:17:16.360
contents into the synaptic
cleft, the concentration of

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:21.187
these ligands rise.
Another characteristic of the

00:17:21.187 --> 00:17:25.209
synapse is that the
post-synaptic membrane,

00:17:25.209 --> 00:17:30.955
the membrane of the cell which
is going to receive the signal

00:17:30.955 --> 00:17:34.988
has receptors on it.
Those receptors,

00:17:34.988 --> 00:17:40.006
some fraction of them,
are specific for the ligand

00:17:40.006 --> 00:17:44.000
that the pre-synaptic cell
releases.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.091
There's a lot of words here,
long words, pre-synaptic,

00:17:47.091 --> 00:17:48.724
post-synpatic,
but pre, post,

00:17:48.724 --> 00:17:51.049
you get the idea.
Caitlin?Student:

00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:53.430
Just curious;
before the ligand perimeter

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.106
[inaudible]
where are they

00:17:55.106 --> 00:17:59.397
stored?Mark Saltzman:
They're actually stored in these

00:17:59.397 --> 00:18:03.353
vesicles and so--and they get
into the vesicles in a variety

00:18:03.353 --> 00:18:06.640
of different ways.
In some cells they're recycled,

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.496
that is the cell is able to
take up the neurotransmitter

00:18:09.496 --> 00:18:11.470
after it's released and restore
it,

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:15.747
but most often there are enzyme
systems inside the pre-synaptic

00:18:15.747 --> 00:18:18.576
membrane where those
neurotransmitters are

00:18:18.576 --> 00:18:20.798
synthesized.
They're synthesized,

00:18:20.798 --> 00:18:24.319
they're packaged into vesicles,
and then they're just waiting.

00:18:24.319 --> 00:18:28.359
If you could look inside a
pre-synaptic axon terminal,

00:18:28.359 --> 00:18:32.398
you would find one of the
characteristics is that it's

00:18:32.398 --> 00:18:36.666
loaded with these vesicles and
they're just sitting there

00:18:36.666 --> 00:18:40.781
waiting to receive an action
potential so that they can

00:18:40.781 --> 00:18:45.440
immediately dump their contents.
One of the things you know

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.480
about the nervous system is its
fast.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.900
I decided to move,
I can move right away.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:55.440
So, in order to have fast
transmission you do that by

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.980
transmitting electrical signals;
that happens pretty quickly.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.908
You turn on your lamp,
it happens pretty fast because

00:19:03.908 --> 00:19:07.987
current can flow very quickly
through wire or through a

00:19:07.987 --> 00:19:12.787
charged - a solution of ions.
So, that process happens fast

00:19:12.787 --> 00:19:16.767
but you also need this
neurotransmitter release and

00:19:16.767 --> 00:19:20.825
activation to happen fast so
that you can have rapid

00:19:20.825 --> 00:19:21.940
activity.

00:19:26.069 --> 00:19:29.985
Now, in this cartoon here
I've shown a variety of

00:19:29.985 --> 00:19:34.428
different receptors just to show
- just to remind you of the

00:19:34.428 --> 00:19:39.096
different families of receptor
molecules that could be involved

00:19:39.096 --> 00:19:42.410
in receiving and translating a
signal.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.928
But in general,
for each neurotransmitter that

00:19:44.928 --> 00:19:48.174
released it there would only be
one population of receptors

00:19:48.174 --> 00:19:52.233
that's ready to receive it.
In some cases it might be a

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:56.890
ligand-gated ion channel.
Wouldn't that be convenient?

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:01.244
Because if it was a
neurotransmitter activated ion

00:20:01.244 --> 00:20:07.109
channel, what would happen when
the neurotransmitter bound here?

00:20:07.109 --> 00:20:10.443
It would generate an electrical
signal because it would - you'd

00:20:10.443 --> 00:20:13.562
open the ion channel and you
would ion fluxes and you would

00:20:13.562 --> 00:20:17.003
change the membrane potential in
just the way I described for the

00:20:17.003 --> 00:20:20.213
action potential.
This is a mechanism by which an

00:20:20.213 --> 00:20:23.650
electrical signal comes here,
it gets translated into a

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:26.621
chemical signal,
the chemical diffuses across

00:20:26.621 --> 00:20:30.334
the gap and reinitiates a - an
electrical signal in the next

00:20:30.334 --> 00:20:33.039
cell and that's one way that it
happens.

00:20:33.039 --> 00:20:36.504
It can also happen in other
ways, it could be a G-protein

00:20:36.504 --> 00:20:39.660
coupled receptor which we talked
about last time,

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.645
which indirectly activates
another ion channel to start the

00:20:43.645 --> 00:20:46.630
electrical signal.
Why do this?

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:51.384
Well, one reason to do this is
because on each post-synaptic

00:20:51.384 --> 00:20:56.140
neuron there might be many axons
coming together at once,

00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:00.016
and each one might be
generating a different kind of

00:21:00.016 --> 00:21:04.349
signal, through maybe even
different neurotransmitters.

00:21:04.349 --> 00:21:08.991
Because this post-synaptic
neuron is going to be receiving

00:21:08.991 --> 00:21:12.329
different signals from different
cells,

00:21:12.329 --> 00:21:16.792
it's decision about what to do
next, and the what to do next is

00:21:16.792 --> 00:21:20.318
either create an actual
potential or not create an

00:21:20.318 --> 00:21:23.909
action potential.
So, it makes a binary decision,

00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:27.130
either I create an action
potential or I don't,

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:31.435
but that decision could be
based on many inputs,

00:21:31.435 --> 00:21:34.549
not just on input from one
cell.

00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:40.480
It could be the integration of
many different chemical signals.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.105
Because of that,
because they're not directly

00:21:44.105 --> 00:21:48.554
wired together but because there
is - are decisions and

00:21:48.554 --> 00:21:52.180
integrations occurring at each
junction,

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:59.259
the potential operation of the
nervous system becomes diverse.

00:21:59.259 --> 00:22:02.962
So, you have both the diversity
in the physical connections,

00:22:02.962 --> 00:22:06.789
any one cell is potentially
contacting lots of other cells.

00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:10.907
You have a diversity in the
chemical changes that occur as a

00:22:10.907 --> 00:22:13.490
result of any of those
connections.

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:18.897
That's what leads to some of
the complexity of function of

00:22:18.897 --> 00:22:22.251
the nervous system.
I want to talk about the

00:22:22.251 --> 00:22:24.440
immune system for the rest of
the time here.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.936
Again, the point today is not
for you to understand in detail

00:22:28.936 --> 00:22:32.907
all these mechanisms but to
understand how those basic

00:22:32.907 --> 00:22:35.829
concepts we talked about last
time,

00:22:35.829 --> 00:22:40.520
basic concepts of cell
communication if arranged in the

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.950
right kinds of ways can lead to
complex outcomes.

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:49.218
That was the point I was trying
to illustrate in the nervous

00:22:49.218 --> 00:22:51.864
system.
In the immune system you could

00:22:51.864 --> 00:22:55.521
think of it as an even more
complex set of outcomes that

00:22:55.521 --> 00:22:59.053
occur.
The outcomes that occur are

00:22:59.053 --> 00:23:04.784
protective outcomes in general.
Our immune system's function is

00:23:04.784 --> 00:23:09.075
to keep us healthy in the face
of an environment where there

00:23:09.075 --> 00:23:12.930
are lots of things that could
potentially harm us.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:17.560
The study of immunology is the
study of mechanisms that your

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:22.505
body uses to protect itself from
- mainly from foreign pathogens

00:23:22.505 --> 00:23:26.625
like viruses and bacteria.
Some words that are useful

00:23:26.625 --> 00:23:28.390
in this discussion,
a 'host'.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:32.253
A host is the organism that
you're interested in defending

00:23:32.253 --> 00:23:35.710
and it could be you or me or
some typical person.

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:38.701
'Foreign' is,
then, any molecule or set of

00:23:38.701 --> 00:23:42.496
molecules or substances that are
foreign to the host,

00:23:42.496 --> 00:23:49.156
they don't belong there;
it could be foreign proteins

00:23:49.156 --> 00:23:56.246
from a virus,
could be foreign elements from

00:23:56.246 --> 00:24:01.206
a bacterium,
it could be that one of your

00:24:01.206 --> 00:24:06.090
cells has become mutated,
is now abnormal and so doesn't

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:09.366
belong in you anymore.
It's foreign,

00:24:09.366 --> 00:24:14.240
it's not part of the host or
not a normal part of the host.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.160
So, all those things would be
considered foreign.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.543
We're going to use this
special word "antigen," and

00:24:20.543 --> 00:24:23.049
antigen has a very particular
meaning.

00:24:23.049 --> 00:24:26.815
Its molecules are pieces of
molecules often derived from

00:24:26.815 --> 00:24:30.579
foreign pathogens which
stimulate an immune response.

00:24:30.579 --> 00:24:33.684
So, antigens are molecules or
pieces of molecules that

00:24:33.684 --> 00:24:37.710
stimulate an immune response.
Any molecule can be an antigen;

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:43.615
the food that you eat is full
of antigens, microbes that try

00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:48.019
to live in your body are full of
antigens.

00:24:48.019 --> 00:24:50.609
Pieces of your own cells are
antigens as well.

00:24:50.609 --> 00:24:55.013
They're just antigens that
belong to you and so you don't

00:24:55.013 --> 00:24:59.181
normally mount an immune
response to antigens that are

00:24:59.181 --> 00:25:01.704
part of you.
We'll talk about how that

00:25:01.704 --> 00:25:03.930
happens a little bit as we go
through here.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:07.347
Generally,
you think about the immune

00:25:07.347 --> 00:25:12.047
system protecting against
different classes of pathogens

00:25:12.047 --> 00:25:17.259
and several classes of pathogens
are shown on this table.

00:25:17.259 --> 00:25:21.184
So, you're familiar with some
of these bacteria like

00:25:21.184 --> 00:25:24.647
salmonella, or the micro
bacterium that causes

00:25:24.647 --> 00:25:29.910
tuberculosis are shown here.
Viruses, you know about viruses;

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:33.815
variola, we're going to talk
about next week which causes

00:25:33.815 --> 00:25:37.972
smallpox, influenza,
which causes the flu and HIV of

00:25:37.972 --> 00:25:41.609
course which cause AIDS are some
examples.

00:25:41.609 --> 00:25:46.233
Fungi which don't often cause
infections in people with

00:25:46.233 --> 00:25:51.200
healthy immune systems but can
under some circumstances,

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.400
and can be tremendous problems
in patients that have weakened

00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:00.077
immune systems.
Parasitic organisms like

00:26:00.077 --> 00:26:07.925
protozoa and worms which are -
which can cause terrible

00:26:07.925 --> 00:26:11.604
diseases.
Malaria is one that causes much

00:26:11.604 --> 00:26:14.081
disease worldwide.
Schistomiosis,

00:26:14.081 --> 00:26:17.957
which is a worm that lives in
river waters,

00:26:17.957 --> 00:26:23.125
causes terrible diseases that
are still prevalent in many

00:26:23.125 --> 00:26:27.644
parts of the world.
So, just an introduction to

00:26:27.644 --> 00:26:32.329
the classes of potential foreign
invaders that our immune system

00:26:32.329 --> 00:26:36.808
tries to defend us against.
Because it's working to defend

00:26:36.808 --> 00:26:40.930
us against many different kinds
of potential assaults,

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:45.664
the immune system has a diverse
repertoire of responses that it

00:26:45.664 --> 00:26:48.490
uses in the face of these
assaults.

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:53.147
One kind of response is called
the innate response and innate

00:26:53.147 --> 00:26:56.640
means that it's present from the
beginning.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.613
So, this is an immune response
that doesn't have to be

00:26:59.613 --> 00:27:02.867
activated and we're used to
thinking about immune responses

00:27:02.867 --> 00:27:06.758
that have to be activated.
You get a vaccine for chicken

00:27:06.758 --> 00:27:10.795
pox, it gets injected,
and sometime later you're going

00:27:10.795 --> 00:27:14.690
to be protected against it.
Or you get a cold,

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:19.613
the cold virus takes hold,
the viruses start replicating

00:27:19.613 --> 00:27:25.072
inside of you and it takes some
time for immune system to gear

00:27:25.072 --> 00:27:29.035
up to eliminate it,
so we're used to thinking about

00:27:29.035 --> 00:27:33.549
responses that take some time.
But innate responses are there

00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:38.769
from the very beginning and they
can fight foreign--against

00:27:38.769 --> 00:27:43.115
foreign pathogens immediately.
It's mainly--these

00:27:43.115 --> 00:27:46.492
functions are mainly performed
by a set of cells called

00:27:46.492 --> 00:27:48.958
macrophages,
neutrophils and natural killer

00:27:48.958 --> 00:27:51.812
cells, which are circulating
throughout your body all the

00:27:51.812 --> 00:27:54.701
time,
ready to destroy anything that

00:27:54.701 --> 00:27:57.680
they recognized as not part of
you.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:03.264
So, that's the innate response.
We're not really going to say

00:28:03.264 --> 00:28:05.857
much about that here,
there's a little bit about in

00:28:05.857 --> 00:28:08.432
the book.
If you go onto study immunology

00:28:08.432 --> 00:28:12.336
you'll learn that this is one of
the most important and rapidly

00:28:12.336 --> 00:28:15.170
evolving areas of the study of
immunology.

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:18.625
In fact, the people who have
been most important in

00:28:18.625 --> 00:28:22.634
understanding how the innate
immune system works are people

00:28:22.634 --> 00:28:23.810
here at Yale.

00:28:28.049 --> 00:28:31.465
The immune system that
we're used to thinking about is

00:28:31.465 --> 00:28:34.881
called the adaptive immune
system, and the adaptive immune

00:28:34.881 --> 00:28:38.470
system does just that.
It changes or adapts in

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:41.559
response to an insult or a
threat.

00:28:41.559 --> 00:28:46.129
So, this is the kind of immune
response that gets activated

00:28:46.129 --> 00:28:50.514
only when it's needed.
Then it will stay activated for

00:28:50.514 --> 00:28:54.779
some period of time,
and eventually disappear again.

00:28:54.779 --> 00:28:59.303
There are two types of adaptive
immune responses and they're

00:28:59.303 --> 00:29:04.262
called humoral immune responses.
Humoral comes from the term

00:29:04.262 --> 00:29:09.228
humours and it used to be that
we thought about disease as

00:29:09.228 --> 00:29:14.019
being caused by the balance of
humours in our blood.

00:29:14.019 --> 00:29:17.077
You could have good humours and
you could have bad humours and

00:29:17.077 --> 00:29:19.017
if those humours,
whatever they are,

00:29:19.017 --> 00:29:22.254
got out of balance then you got
sick if you had too many bad

00:29:22.254 --> 00:29:27.200
ones compared to good ones.
Humoral refers to immunity

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:33.910
in the blood and it's immunity
that's in the blood in the form

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:37.743
of antibodies.
We're going to talk a lot about

00:29:37.743 --> 00:29:41.163
antibodies over the next week or
so, but antibodies are

00:29:41.163 --> 00:29:43.685
specialized proteins that,
as you know,

00:29:43.685 --> 00:29:46.654
are designed to bind to
antigens or foreign molecules

00:29:46.654 --> 00:29:48.735
inside the body.
I'll say more about that in a

00:29:48.735 --> 00:29:50.756
minute.
The humoral immune response

00:29:50.756 --> 00:29:54.833
involves antibody production and
antibodies are made by a subset

00:29:54.833 --> 00:29:56.580
of cells called B-cells.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.552
The other part of the
adaptive immune system is the

00:30:04.552 --> 00:30:08.882
cell mediated immune system and
this is an immune where - that

00:30:08.882 --> 00:30:12.644
doesn't involve antibodies but
involves cells that are

00:30:12.644 --> 00:30:16.760
activated in response to a
foreign antigen and that utilize

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:21.242
cellular means to get rid of it.
Usually the cellular means that

00:30:21.242 --> 00:30:24.579
they get rid of is that instead
of an antibody being produced,

00:30:24.579 --> 00:30:30.008
you activate a population of
cells that will specifically go

00:30:30.008 --> 00:30:33.319
and hunt down the foreign
antigen,

00:30:33.319 --> 00:30:35.793
or more commonly,
cells that contain the foreign

00:30:35.793 --> 00:30:37.783
antigen.
Now, why do you need a cell

00:30:37.783 --> 00:30:40.980
mediated immune response if you
have an antibody response?

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.920
We'll talk about that in a few
minutes.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.901
We're going to - one of the
reasons why you'll see why cell

00:30:47.901 --> 00:30:51.882
mediated responses are important
is because antigens can appear

00:30:51.882 --> 00:30:55.646
in your body in different ways.
The way that they appear in

00:30:55.646 --> 00:30:58.679
your body tells the immune
system something about where

00:30:58.679 --> 00:31:01.807
they came from.
We'll learn more about that in

00:31:01.807 --> 00:31:05.548
a moment, but basically it
allows the immune system to

00:31:05.548 --> 00:31:09.289
distinguish between viral and
bacterial pathogens,

00:31:09.289 --> 00:31:12.149
and respond appropriately
depending on the type of

00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:15.194
pathogen that's there.
The main effector cells in

00:31:15.194 --> 00:31:17.880
cell mediated immunity,
the cells that do the main

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:22.140
business are called T-cells.
Now, T-cells are also involved

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:26.579
in humoral immunity but they're
not the end result.

00:31:26.579 --> 00:31:30.249
The end result in humoral
immunity is B-cells producing

00:31:30.249 --> 00:31:34.442
antibodies, the end result,
or the molecules that carry out

00:31:34.442 --> 00:31:38.170
the function in cell mediated
immunity are T-cells,

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:44.845
either - let me talk about
different types of T-cells in a

00:31:44.845 --> 00:31:51.638
moment, but either cells that
are called CD4+ cells or CD8+

00:31:51.638 --> 00:31:54.998
cells.
Why do you have these different

00:31:54.998 --> 00:31:59.047
kinds of responses?
The reason is that because of

00:31:59.047 --> 00:32:03.867
the ways that different
microorganisms take - the ways

00:32:03.867 --> 00:32:09.142
the different microorganisms
reproduce and damage cells and

00:32:09.142 --> 00:32:13.250
tissue within your body,
you need different ways to

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:16.480
respond to them effectively.
Think for a minute about

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.150
what happens if you get infected
with a virus.

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:22.456
Now, a virus is not capable of
reproducing on its own,

00:32:22.456 --> 00:32:26.387
so if you got a virus into your
body somehow and it didn't enter

00:32:26.387 --> 00:32:29.619
any of your cells,
it would cause no damage

00:32:29.619 --> 00:32:34.593
because it could not reproduce.
It's reproduction of the virus

00:32:34.593 --> 00:32:39.246
and passage of that virus onto
new cells which causes the

00:32:39.246 --> 00:32:42.819
problems with disease that we
associate.

00:32:42.819 --> 00:32:46.134
They often kill the cells that
they infect, and that's a

00:32:46.134 --> 00:32:49.996
problem with viruses.
A virus isn't troublesome until

00:32:49.996 --> 00:32:54.470
it infects a host cell and when
it infects a host cell it

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:59.023
becomes troublesome because it
takes over some of the host

00:32:59.023 --> 00:33:02.716
machinery for DNA synthesis,
transcription,

00:33:02.716 --> 00:33:06.789
and translation and starts
making more viruses and this

00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:10.410
happens largely in the cytoplasm
of the cell.

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:14.337
How is your immune system
going to recognize that this

00:33:14.337 --> 00:33:18.333
virus is there causing bad
results if it's living inside of

00:33:18.333 --> 00:33:21.916
a cell and doing all its
business inside a cell where

00:33:21.916 --> 00:33:26.820
antibodies can't get to it?
Antibodies are outside of cells

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:30.299
circulating in your
extracellular fluid.

00:33:30.299 --> 00:33:34.548
Well, the way that your immune
system recognizes it is that all

00:33:34.548 --> 00:33:38.660
the cells of our body express a
molecule on their surface,

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:42.710
a membrane protein called the
MHC1 complex.

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:45.709
MHC1 is a word,
MHC stands for major

00:33:45.709 --> 00:33:50.594
histocompatibility complex and
it's one of the things that

00:33:50.594 --> 00:33:54.279
distinguishes my cells from your
cells,

00:33:54.279 --> 00:33:57.369
from your parents cells,
from your roommates cells.

00:33:57.369 --> 00:34:02.309
Each one of our cells - one of
the things that distinguishes

00:34:02.309 --> 00:34:06.746
them is the kind of MHC
molecules that all of my cells

00:34:06.746 --> 00:34:09.359
make.
It's what makes my cells my

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:11.699
cells, and your cells your
cells.

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:16.086
It's the reason why you can't
do organ transplants between

00:34:16.086 --> 00:34:19.550
people that aren't
immunologically matched.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:24.194
If you take an organ from one
person and put it in another,

00:34:24.194 --> 00:34:28.679
if their MHC molecules don't
match then the immune system

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:33.563
recognizes - the immune system
of the host recognizes 'this is

00:34:33.563 --> 00:34:38.048
not the right MHC for me' and
the immune tries to destroy

00:34:38.048 --> 00:34:41.909
those cells.
One of the functions of MHC is

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:45.448
to indicate which cells belong
inside your body,

00:34:45.448 --> 00:34:49.099
which cells don't.
The other thing that it

00:34:49.099 --> 00:34:53.469
does is that when a virus is
inside these cells making its

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:56.635
proteins,
some of those proteins get

00:34:56.635 --> 00:35:01.903
processed or digested into small
fragments that are themselves

00:35:01.903 --> 00:35:06.317
antigens.
Those antigens get expressed

00:35:06.317 --> 00:35:10.478
together with MHC1.
One of the other things that

00:35:10.478 --> 00:35:14.099
MHC1 does, in addition to
marking yourselves as your own,

00:35:14.099 --> 00:35:18.355
is that it's capable of making
combinations with all the

00:35:18.355 --> 00:35:22.611
different molecules that are
present inside the cell and

00:35:22.611 --> 00:35:28.062
expressing them on the surface,
and sort of showing them to the

00:35:28.062 --> 00:35:32.179
outside world.
It's showing them to the

00:35:32.179 --> 00:35:36.829
outside world in combination
with MHC1.

00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:41.068
The immune system,
some cells of the immune

00:35:41.068 --> 00:35:47.527
system, in particular this class
of T-cells called CD8 cells have

00:35:47.527 --> 00:35:53.139
receptors which recognize MHC1.
They're capable of

00:35:53.139 --> 00:35:57.769
recognizing MHC1 together with
foreign antigens.

00:35:57.769 --> 00:36:02.690
When these CD8 T-cells see your
MHC1 together with an antigen

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:07.610
that doesn't belong in you,
it creates an immune response.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:12.989
The immune response is directed
at killing this cell.

00:36:12.989 --> 00:36:15.611
The notion is,
if there's something foreign

00:36:15.611 --> 00:36:18.170
that's being produced inside
this cell,

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:21.756
then that cell must have been
corrupted in some way and it has

00:36:21.756 --> 00:36:24.295
to be gotten rid of.
It could have been corrupted

00:36:24.295 --> 00:36:26.786
because a virus was inside of it
so it was making foreign

00:36:26.786 --> 00:36:28.918
proteins.
That's making the cell look

00:36:28.918 --> 00:36:32.056
foreign because some of that
foreign protein is on the

00:36:32.056 --> 00:36:35.627
surface with MHC1.
It could be foreign because

00:36:35.627 --> 00:36:39.294
it's become malignant.
Maybe it got mutated and its

00:36:39.294 --> 00:36:41.460
making the wrong kinds of
proteins;

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:45.554
cancer cells often do that.
So, those wrong proteins get

00:36:45.554 --> 00:36:49.634
presented on MHC1 and your
immune system can kill the cell

00:36:49.634 --> 00:36:53.926
because it's a tumor cell.
This is a way for the immune

00:36:53.926 --> 00:36:58.834
system to recognize things that
are going wrong inside the cell

00:36:58.834 --> 00:37:01.130
protected from antibodies.

00:37:05.489 --> 00:37:07.895
Other kinds of
microorganisms reproduce and

00:37:07.895 --> 00:37:10.039
cause tissue damage in a
different way.

00:37:10.039 --> 00:37:14.146
If you get bacteria under your
skin, if you get a cut and

00:37:14.146 --> 00:37:17.813
somehow that cut gets - bacteria
gets inside there,

00:37:17.813 --> 00:37:21.039
the bacteria can reproduce on
their own.

00:37:21.039 --> 00:37:23.940
They're fully functional
organisms that can reproduce on

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:27.104
their own, and they can start
growing outside of any cell and

00:37:27.104 --> 00:37:29.780
that's what they do,
they live extracellularly.

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:33.760
Well, your innate immune system
tries to get rid of them.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:36.741
The innate immune system
composed of neutrophils and

00:37:36.741 --> 00:37:38.762
macrophages;
these are cells that are

00:37:38.762 --> 00:37:41.869
crawling around your body all
the time ready to eat bacteria.

00:37:41.869 --> 00:37:46.921
When they do that they can
actually engulf the bacteria in

00:37:46.921 --> 00:37:52.327
a process called phagocytosis
and break the bacteria down into

00:37:52.327 --> 00:37:55.320
antigens.
Then those antigens get

00:37:55.320 --> 00:38:00.039
expressed with MHC just like
they did in all the other cells

00:38:00.039 --> 00:38:04.364
inside the host,
but particular cells of the

00:38:04.364 --> 00:38:10.078
innate immune system have a
different kind of MHC called

00:38:10.078 --> 00:38:13.862
MHC2.
When T-cells recognize a

00:38:13.862 --> 00:38:21.368
foreign antigen that's combined
with MHC2, they know that that

00:38:21.368 --> 00:38:29.119
antigen must have come from one
of these professional phagocytic

00:38:29.119 --> 00:38:37.239
cells digesting bacteria or some
other extracellular invader.

00:38:37.239 --> 00:38:41.472
Because this antigen gets
expressed in the context of

00:38:41.472 --> 00:38:45.380
MHC2, your immune system
responds differently.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:48.356
Now, there's a lot of words
here, I mean there's a lot of

00:38:48.356 --> 00:38:50.191
words, there's a lot of
abbreviations,

00:38:50.191 --> 00:38:52.762
there's a lot of players.
The details are not

00:38:52.762 --> 00:38:55.613
particularly important to us.
Some of them are in your book

00:38:55.613 --> 00:38:57.960
and I hope you read about them
because it's really interesting,

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:03.447
but the main points are that
for us here that this is a very

00:39:03.447 --> 00:39:09.307
elaborate of cell communication
that is - has the same essential

00:39:09.307 --> 00:39:14.795
characteristics that we talked
about last time in that there

00:39:14.795 --> 00:39:19.445
are receptors that are
presenting signals which now

00:39:19.445 --> 00:39:23.950
other cells receive.
Those receptors are more

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:27.989
complicated than the ones we
thought about before.

00:39:27.989 --> 00:39:30.389
The ligands are more
complicated than the ones we

00:39:30.389 --> 00:39:33.415
thought about before.
The reason for that complexity

00:39:33.415 --> 00:39:37.103
is because your immune system
needs to be able to respond to

00:39:37.103 --> 00:39:40.042
all the potential foreign
invaders that we could

00:39:40.042 --> 00:39:43.595
encounter.
It's not just a limited number

00:39:43.595 --> 00:39:48.652
of things that might happen,
and so it's evolved these sort

00:39:48.652 --> 00:39:54.058
of mechanisms in order to allow
it to respond to a wide variety

00:39:54.058 --> 00:40:00.599
of potential molecules,
and to respond in the same way

00:40:00.599 --> 00:40:07.704
- in a coordinated way that
somehow knows where those

00:40:07.704 --> 00:40:12.855
foreign molecules came from.
Importantly,

00:40:12.855 --> 00:40:16.898
is able to distinguish foreign
molecules from your own

00:40:16.898 --> 00:40:19.283
molecules.
So, read about this but please

00:40:19.283 --> 00:40:21.836
don't worry about all of the
details because the details

00:40:21.836 --> 00:40:24.530
aren't so important for what
we're going to talk about.

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:27.650
He says that and then he
shows an even more detailed

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:31.111
picture, but what I want to show
you on this slide is just the

00:40:31.111 --> 00:40:34.155
simple part of it.
I talked last time about MHC -

00:40:34.155 --> 00:40:37.351
on the last slide about MHC1.
So, this is a cell that's

00:40:37.351 --> 00:40:40.548
infected with a microorganism,
it's infected with a virus,

00:40:40.548 --> 00:40:43.239
let's say it's infected with
influenza virus.

00:40:43.239 --> 00:40:47.808
That virus is reproducing
inside cells of your respiratory

00:40:47.808 --> 00:40:49.680
tract.
You've got the flu,

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:53.049
you've got influenza in your
upper respiratory tract,

00:40:53.049 --> 00:40:55.639
your cells are making more
influenza.

00:40:55.639 --> 00:41:01.852
That gets presented in the
context of MHC1 on cells within

00:41:01.852 --> 00:41:05.139
your body.
Immune cells recognize it,

00:41:05.139 --> 00:41:09.858
and they recognize it by a very
special form of receptor-ligand

00:41:09.858 --> 00:41:14.425
interaction where the ligand is
MHC1 with the foreign antigen

00:41:14.425 --> 00:41:18.688
and the receptor is a receptor
called the T-cell receptor

00:41:18.688 --> 00:41:23.445
complex.
T-cell receptor complex is able

00:41:23.445 --> 00:41:30.326
to recognize on one population
of T-cells, able to recognize

00:41:30.326 --> 00:41:34.147
MHC1,
together with foreign peptides,

00:41:34.147 --> 00:41:39.549
on another type of T-cell able
to recognize MHC2 with other

00:41:39.549 --> 00:41:43.764
types of foreign antigens.
What happens when that

00:41:43.764 --> 00:41:46.909
recognition takes place is that
your immune system gets

00:41:46.909 --> 00:41:50.288
activated, and the activation
that happens usually involves

00:41:50.288 --> 00:41:53.114
two things.
It involves proliferation,

00:41:53.114 --> 00:41:55.519
which we talked about last
week.

00:41:55.519 --> 00:42:01.525
So, when the right signal is
received, the right T-cell finds

00:42:01.525 --> 00:42:05.929
your host cell with a foreign
virus in it,

00:42:05.929 --> 00:42:09.519
the first thing that happens is
that this T-cell becomes

00:42:09.519 --> 00:42:12.000
activated and it starts
reproducing,

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.461
making more copies of itself.
So, reproduction,

00:42:15.461 --> 00:42:18.875
proliferation,
cell growth happens and then

00:42:18.875 --> 00:42:22.289
those cells become more
differentiated.

00:42:22.289 --> 00:42:26.074
They become more mature and
they mature into,

00:42:26.074 --> 00:42:29.429
in this case,
they mature into cytotoxic

00:42:29.429 --> 00:42:30.290
cells,

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:37.345
and cytotoxic means 'cyto' -
cell, 'toxic' - killing,

00:42:37.345 --> 00:42:41.340
they mature into cells that are
capable of killing other cells.

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:45.069
You don't want to generate a
lot of cells that just start

00:42:45.069 --> 00:42:47.599
killing every cell inside your
body.

00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:52.524
Here's where the intelligence
of the immune system comes in,

00:42:52.524 --> 00:42:57.448
is that these cytotoxic T-cells
that are generated only kill

00:42:57.448 --> 00:43:00.619
cells that have this signal on
it.

00:43:00.619 --> 00:43:05.028
They only kill cells that have
the signal which stimulated

00:43:05.028 --> 00:43:08.193
them.
So, they don't start killing

00:43:08.193 --> 00:43:12.130
all the cells in your
respiratory system;

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:15.469
they only kill the cells that
are harboring the virus.

00:43:15.469 --> 00:43:19.545
They know that these cells are
harboring the virus because

00:43:19.545 --> 00:43:23.120
those cells have foreign
antigens on their MHC1.

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:28.961
Does that make sense?
In the same way cells get

00:43:28.961 --> 00:43:31.653
activated but these are
different cells,

00:43:31.653 --> 00:43:35.449
these are T helper cells that
get activated by MHC2.

00:43:35.449 --> 00:43:40.485
Helper cells don't become
cytotoxic cells but they help B

00:43:40.485 --> 00:43:45.880
cells become antigen producing -
antibody producing cells.

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:48.710
So, this kind of recognition
leads to an effect.

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:50.909
What's the effect?
Cell killing.

00:43:50.909 --> 00:43:53.966
This kind of recognition leads
to another effect,

00:43:53.966 --> 00:43:57.199
what's the effect?
Antibody production.

00:43:57.199 --> 00:44:01.889
Why are antibodies useful for
bacteria?

00:44:01.889 --> 00:44:06.426
Because bacteria are outside of
cells and when antibodies bind

00:44:06.426 --> 00:44:09.030
to them they can neutralize
them.

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:14.722
They can't always neutralize
viruses because the viruses are

00:44:14.722 --> 00:44:19.306
predominantly inside cells.
That's why you need two kinds

00:44:19.306 --> 00:44:22.255
of immune responses.
We're going to talk a lot

00:44:22.255 --> 00:44:24.652
about antibodies,
we're going to talk about

00:44:24.652 --> 00:44:28.066
antibodies in section,
and at the end of the course,

00:44:28.066 --> 00:44:32.313
our last section meeting every
year we get together and we talk

00:44:32.313 --> 00:44:36.080
about which sections did you
think were useful and which

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.300
parts - which sections were not
so useful.

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.300
The section when you do today
is always the most popular

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:45.310
section of the year,
you'll know why after the

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:49.293
section, and you can tell me
afterwards if you think you

00:44:49.293 --> 00:44:52.364
figured out why.
It involves thinking about

00:44:52.364 --> 00:44:55.820
antibodies and how to use
antibodies and technology.

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:58.246
Well, let me just say for
the rest of time where do

00:44:58.246 --> 00:45:01.345
antibodies come from naturally?
They come from B-cells,

00:45:01.345 --> 00:45:05.277
they come from B-cells that are
activated with a specific

00:45:05.277 --> 00:45:07.627
antigen.
The antibodies that are

00:45:07.627 --> 00:45:11.949
produced from these B-cells are
also specific for the antigen.

00:45:11.949 --> 00:45:17.040
An antigen expressed in the
context of MHC stimulates your

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.312
immune system.
One of the results of that

00:45:20.312 --> 00:45:24.634
stimulation is that B-cells - a
particular subset of B-cells -

00:45:24.634 --> 00:45:27.119
gets activated.
What happens when they're

00:45:27.119 --> 00:45:29.781
activated is they start to
reproduce, they make more and

00:45:29.781 --> 00:45:32.766
more, and more B-cells.
Those B-cells also mature,

00:45:32.766 --> 00:45:36.749
they differentiate and that's
what's shown on this slide here

00:45:36.749 --> 00:45:40.666
is the differentiation of those
immature B-cells into mature

00:45:40.666 --> 00:45:43.739
B-cells.
What do immature B-cells do?

00:45:43.739 --> 00:45:46.959
They just wait,
they wait for their time,

00:45:46.959 --> 00:45:50.984
they wait until you are in
danger from a particular

00:45:50.984 --> 00:45:54.476
antigen.
When you get exposed to that

00:45:54.476 --> 00:45:59.260
particular antigen they say,
'I'm on, it's my time'.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:01.840
They differentiate,
they make many copies of

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.360
themselves - I'm sorry they
proliferate,

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.928
they make many copies of
themselves, and then they

00:46:07.928 --> 00:46:11.570
differentiate into antibody
production machines.

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:15.654
The antibodies they make are
all specific to the antigen that

00:46:15.654 --> 00:46:18.209
stimulated them.
That's shown here,

00:46:18.209 --> 00:46:21.170
a B-cell gets stimulated,
matures into an antibody

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:23.874
producing factory.
Antibodies look like this,

00:46:23.874 --> 00:46:26.634
they're big proteins,
if you looked at them under a

00:46:26.634 --> 00:46:30.000
microscope or if you looked at
them in cartoons they're shaped

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.199
like the letter Y.
One part of them is all common.

00:46:35.199 --> 00:46:39.079
The parts at the end of the Y's
are variable.

00:46:39.079 --> 00:46:43.835
What's variable about them is
that they bind to a specific

00:46:43.835 --> 00:46:46.655
antigen.
They bind to the antigen that

00:46:46.655 --> 00:46:50.440
stimulated their production.
So, I have a bacteria

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:54.983
infection, stimulates my immune
system, I start making

00:46:54.983 --> 00:46:59.269
antibodies that bind to an
antigen specific to that

00:46:59.269 --> 00:47:01.963
bacteria.
Won't help me against other

00:47:01.963 --> 00:47:04.730
bacteria, but only against the
one that I've got.

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:07.739
How do they recognize it?
Because at the end of the Y,

00:47:07.739 --> 00:47:11.039
there's a special region of the
antibody, the antigen-binding

00:47:11.039 --> 00:47:13.541
region,
that is highly tuned for

00:47:13.541 --> 00:47:17.200
binding to the antigen that
stimulated them.

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:25.568
We're going to talk more
about now how to use antibodies

00:47:25.568 --> 00:47:28.491
in section today.
One of the beautiful things

00:47:28.491 --> 00:47:32.167
about antibodies is that one
your immune system is able to

00:47:32.167 --> 00:47:35.070
make antibodies against all the
thousands,

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:37.027
ten thousand,
hundred thousand different

00:47:37.027 --> 00:47:40.239
pathogens that you'll come into
contact with in your lifetime.

00:47:40.239 --> 00:47:44.329
So, our bodies are capable of
making antibodies that are tuned

00:47:44.329 --> 00:47:48.619
for all the potential antigens
that we come into contact with,

00:47:48.619 --> 00:47:53.010
That's amazing that we have
this capacity to respond and you

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:56.900
respond only when needed.
From a technological

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:01.694
perspective, antibodies are
incredible tools because

00:48:01.694 --> 00:48:07.053
antibodies are molecules that
are specifically designed to

00:48:07.053 --> 00:48:12.599
bind to a particular antigen or
a particular chemical.

00:48:12.599 --> 00:48:19.139
What if you could manufacture
antibodies?

00:48:19.139 --> 00:48:22.032
Don't worry about how they work
in the immune system,

00:48:22.032 --> 00:48:24.923
but what if you could
manufacture antibodies then you

00:48:24.923 --> 00:48:27.406
could make a chemical,
an antibody,

00:48:27.406 --> 00:48:32.764
that is capable of binding to a
specific other chemical and you

00:48:32.764 --> 00:48:37.294
could use that for things.
It turns out you can use

00:48:37.294 --> 00:48:41.053
that for lots of things,
you can use it to detect the

00:48:41.053 --> 00:48:44.739
presence of small amounts of
chemicals anywhere.

00:48:44.739 --> 00:48:52.357
We'll talk about how to use
antibodies in that fashion later

00:48:52.357 --> 00:48:58.369
today in section.
Questions?

00:48:58.369 --> 00:49:01.097
One last word of encouragement,
I'll say it again,

00:49:01.097 --> 00:49:03.380
there's a lot of words in this
chapter,

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:06.505
there's a lot of concepts,
focus on the things that I

00:49:06.505 --> 00:49:08.910
talked about in class not the
details,

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:11.726
the basic concepts.
Focus on the concepts of

00:49:11.726 --> 00:49:14.688
receptors and ligands.
I wanted to show you this slide

00:49:14.688 --> 00:49:18.207
here on the homework.
I realize that this thinking

00:49:18.207 --> 00:49:21.704
about antigen,
antibody combinations and the

00:49:21.704 --> 00:49:26.422
mathematics of how strongly an
antibody binds to a specific

00:49:26.422 --> 00:49:29.502
antigen,
is maybe something that's new

00:49:29.502 --> 00:49:31.809
to you.
There's - this diagram comes

00:49:31.809 --> 00:49:35.058
directly from your book,
from one of the boxes in the

00:49:35.058 --> 00:49:38.869
book which describe how you
analyze antibody interactions.

00:49:38.869 --> 00:49:42.307
If you have questions about
this I hope that you've already

00:49:42.307 --> 00:49:46.159
taken advantage of the teaching
fellows or come up after class,

00:49:46.159 --> 00:49:49.452
I'd be happy to try to answer
your questions now if you have

00:49:49.452 --> 00:49:53.000
time as well.
See you in section.

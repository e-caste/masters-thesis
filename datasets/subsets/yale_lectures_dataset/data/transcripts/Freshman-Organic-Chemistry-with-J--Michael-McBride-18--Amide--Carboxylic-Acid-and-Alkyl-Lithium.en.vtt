00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:07.835
Prof: Okay,
so we're at the conclusion of

00:00:07.835 --> 00:00:13.930
our theoretical study of bonds
and reactivity,

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.080
then we'll go on to something
completely different,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.739
and we're ending by talking
about reactivity in terms of

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:23.458
four functional groups,
and you're doing your own

00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:26.030
functional groups,
remember, for tomorrow.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.460
Okay?
 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.690
So we already talked about
carbonyl last time.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.023
And now we're going to go on to
amide, carboxylic acid and alkyl

00:00:36.023 --> 00:00:39.240
lithium, as other functional
groups.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.883
And then we'll do something
just completely different,

00:00:43.883 --> 00:00:47.300
for the next quarter of the
semester.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.812
Okay, so resonance is HOMO/LUMO
mixing that happens

00:00:54.812 --> 00:00:58.870
within a molecule.
 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.770
The molecule,
of course, knows all about it.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.698
It only becomes
"resonance"

00:01:03.698 --> 00:01:06.001
because we draw a picture
that's too simple,

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.519
and we need to modify the
picture -- right?

00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:12.120
-- and that modification is
called resonance.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.470
And a good example of that is
the amide functional group.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.620
Now when I include an amide on
the first exam where people are

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.790
supposed to identify functional
groups,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.694
circle them and name them,
it's inevitable that some

00:01:25.694 --> 00:01:28.769
people will circle the C
double-bond O and say that's a

00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:32.013
carbonyl group,
and some people will circle the

00:01:32.013 --> 00:01:34.319
nitrogen and say that's an
amine.

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.992
But an amide is not an amine,
and it's not a ketone,

00:01:38.992 --> 00:01:41.010
or a carbonyl group.
 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.580
It's its own thing.
 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.001
And the reason is that those
interact with one another in a

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:48.539
way that makes them no longer
like an amine,

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.900
and no longer like a carbonyl
group.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.330
That's resonance.
 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.733
So we'll look at it here in
terms of two different pictures

00:01:57.733 --> 00:01:59.099
of the molecule.
 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:04.810
One is as a carbonyl amine,
and the other is as an amide,

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.560
which if you're into Lewis
structures you draw with a

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.598
double-headed arrow and show two
resonance structures.

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:17.247
And in the carbonyl and amine,
you identify a HOMO that makes

00:02:17.247 --> 00:02:20.889
the thing a base,
and a LUMO that should make it

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:21.818
an acid.
 

00:02:21.818 --> 00:02:27.316
But resonance can be thought of
as a reaction already within the

00:02:27.316 --> 00:02:30.979
molecule, between the HOMO and
the LUMO.

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:33.430
And it's a make-and-break
situation,

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.280
just like we saw between
molecules last time,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.300
where the unshared pair makes a
new bond --

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.378
in this case the second of a
double bond --

00:02:41.378 --> 00:02:45.758
and something leaves from the
carbon that's being attacked.

00:02:45.758 --> 00:02:49.560
The thing that leaves is the
second bond of a double bond.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.068
So it's another one of these
make-and-break situations.

00:02:52.068 --> 00:02:55.668
But in this case,
it's a correction to our

00:02:55.668 --> 00:03:01.110
naïve, localized picture
that we drew at the beginning.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.360
Okay, so let's see about this.
 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.120
First we have the naïve
prediction,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.710
what that should say about the
characteristics of the molecule,

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.000
and then what the experimental
observation is,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.878
which requires that we use
something more complicated,

00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:19.548
the resonance structures or
thinking in terms of molecular

00:03:19.548 --> 00:03:20.449
orbitals.
 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:24.514
Okay, so the amines and
carbonyls are perfectly stable

00:03:24.514 --> 00:03:27.659
molecules in terms of being low
energy.

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.848
They don't just do something.
 

00:03:29.848 --> 00:03:33.053
But what's associated with the
idea of resonance structures is

00:03:33.053 --> 00:03:36.098
the thing is more stable than
you would've predicted if you

00:03:36.098 --> 00:03:38.410
didn't consider the resonance
structure.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.560
So you say that's more stable.
 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.501
And you can see why it would be
more stable, because the

00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:47.586
unshared pair is mixing with a
vacant orbital and becoming

00:03:47.586 --> 00:03:49.020
lower in energy.
 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.502
In fact, the observation is
that it's more stable by about

00:03:53.502 --> 00:03:56.961
16 kcal/mole,
which is about a fourth as much

00:03:56.961 --> 00:04:00.030
as a carbon-nitrogen bond is
worth.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.500
So it's a significant amount of
energy.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.438
Now, if you have a C-N single
bond,

00:04:06.438 --> 00:04:10.195
that's longer than a double
bond, and longer than a partial

00:04:10.195 --> 00:04:14.276
C-N double bond that you'd have
for the average of the resonance

00:04:14.276 --> 00:04:16.088
structures on the right.
 

00:04:16.088 --> 00:04:20.500
And in fact that bond is
shorter than normal single

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.086
nitrogen-carbon bonds,
by about 0.14 Ångstroms.

00:04:25.086 --> 00:04:25.970
Right?
 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.028
On the left you have a short
double bond for C double-bond O.

00:04:30.028 --> 00:04:32.089
But on the right it's a partial
single bond.

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:34.769
So it should be longer,
not held as tightly.

00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:38.824
And in fact it is longer than
other C-O double bonds,

00:04:38.824 --> 00:04:41.319
by about 0.03 Ångstroms.
 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:42.459
Okay?
 

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:46.182
We've seen before,
when we were talking about

00:04:46.182 --> 00:04:48.952
XH_3,
why nitrogen tends to be

00:04:48.952 --> 00:04:50.793
pyramidal,
so as to give

00:04:50.793 --> 00:04:54.089
s-character to the
unshared pair of electrons.

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:56.942
But on the right,
if it's going to be part of a

00:04:56.942 --> 00:04:59.050
double bond it has to be planar.
 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.778
And we can see why that is.
 

00:05:01.778 --> 00:05:03.910
So here's the Ï€*
LUMO,

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.682
of the C double-bond O,
and here in front is the

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:12.286
unshared pair on nitrogen,
in a p orbital,

00:05:12.286 --> 00:05:18.980
which overlaps and delocalizes,
mixes, with the vacant LUMO.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:19.800
Right?
 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.398
That means that you have a
partial double bond for the C-N,

00:05:24.398 --> 00:05:27.569
and a partial single bond for
the C=O.

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:32.564
How is it that putting in
electrons makes it a single bond

00:05:32.564 --> 00:05:35.019
rather than a double bond?
 

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:39.009
Why would putting in electrons
weaken a bond?

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.300
Alex?
 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.019
Can't hear.
 

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:42.879
Student:  Antibonding.
 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:45.557
Prof: Because it's an
antibonding orbital,

00:05:45.557 --> 00:05:47.009
the Ï€* of C-O.
 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:49.040
Okay?
 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.153
Now, so it's planar,
indeed -- and I'll show you

00:05:53.153 --> 00:05:57.529
pictures that prove it --
because it gives the best

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:58.579
overlap.
 

00:05:58.579 --> 00:06:01.747
If there were an sp
hybrid on the nitrogen,

00:06:01.747 --> 00:06:04.850
the s part of it
wouldn't overlap with the

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:05.949
pÏ€.
 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.850
So a pure p orbital
gives the best overlap.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.504
So that's why it's planar,
from the molecular orbital

00:06:12.504 --> 00:06:13.629
point of view.
 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:17.096
Now, if you have a single bond,
it's easy for things to rotate

00:06:17.096 --> 00:06:19.939
around it, because it's
cylindrically symmetric.

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:23.125
But we know that a Ï€
bond is not cylindrically

00:06:23.125 --> 00:06:25.209
symmetric;
it has that oval shape.

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:30.560
So there's a barrier to
rotation about the central bond

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.829
of a carbon-carbon double bond.
 

00:06:33.829 --> 00:06:36.670
Because when you rotate the
nitrogen in front,

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.678
like this, by 90º,
you've wrecked the overlap that

00:06:40.678 --> 00:06:43.646
allowed those electrons to be
stabilized.

00:06:43.646 --> 00:06:44.389
Right?
 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:47.814
In fact, once you've done this,
there's no reason for the

00:06:47.814 --> 00:06:50.810
nitrogen to be sp^2
hybridized anymore,

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.422
because the unshared pair is
not trying to overlap with the

00:06:54.422 --> 00:06:56.476
carbon p orbital behind
it.

00:06:56.476 --> 00:06:57.100
Right?
 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.874
So it might as well hybridize
and become sp^2 the way

00:07:00.874 --> 00:07:02.088
it normally does.
 

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:06.613
And this structure,
the halfway-rotated structure,

00:07:06.613 --> 00:07:12.245
turns out to be 16 kilocalories
less stable than the one where

00:07:12.245 --> 00:07:14.829
you do have the overlap.
 

00:07:14.829 --> 00:07:19.439
So twisting it has a barrier of
16 kcal/mole.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:23.120
Have you ever seen that number
before?

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.050
Zack?
 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.800
Student:  Yes,
at the top there's one.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.459
Prof: That's what we saw
at the beginning.

00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:29.822
It's more stable when those
electrons can be stabilized,

00:07:29.822 --> 00:07:32.880
as compared to an amine and a
carbonyl that are not

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.860
interacting.
 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.805
Because when you turn it
90º, they indeed are not

00:07:36.805 --> 00:07:39.139
interacting, because they're
orthogonal.

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:43.288
Okay, an amine,
as we said, should be basic,

00:07:43.288 --> 00:07:48.596
and a carbonyl should be acidic
because of the low LUMO,

00:07:48.596 --> 00:07:51.009
the Ï€* C=O.
 

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:56.240
But if they mix with one
another, then the HOMO is lower

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.620
and the LUMO is higher.
 

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.093
So they're not reactive anymore;
they're not as unusual in their

00:08:02.093 --> 00:08:03.663
highness and their lowness.
 

00:08:03.663 --> 00:08:04.129
Right?
 

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:09.600
So it turns out that an amide
is relatively unreactive;

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.199
relative to what you'd expect
for an amine and a carbonyl.

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:17.740
Now do you know where you
encounter amides all the time?

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.180
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.209
Prof: You can touch an
amide, with no problem.

00:08:22.209 --> 00:08:23.360
How?
 

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.500
Sophie?
 

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.629
Student:  Part of amino
acids.

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:26.550
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.810
Student:  They're amino
acids.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.120
Prof: Amino acids,
which make proteins.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.470
Amino acids aren't amides.
 

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.315
But proteins,
which are made of amino acids,

00:08:35.315 --> 00:08:38.889
an amine reacting with a
carbonyl, those are amides.

00:08:38.889 --> 00:08:40.370
And you want them to be stable.
 

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:41.389
Why?
 

00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:44.160
You don't want them to be
reactive, like a carbonyl and an

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:44.548
amine.
 

00:08:44.548 --> 00:08:46.700
Student: 
&gt;

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.940
Prof: It's so your skin
works.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.655
Otherwise, in lab if you --
what does a base -- if you feel

00:08:51.655 --> 00:08:54.700
sodium hydroxide -- you've done
this -- what does it feel like?

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.409
Student:  It's slippery.
 

00:08:55.409 --> 00:08:56.700
Prof: It's slippery.
 

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.431
If amides weren't unusually
stable, then when you felt it,

00:09:01.431 --> 00:09:03.423
your skin would go away.
 

00:09:03.423 --> 00:09:04.169
Right?
 

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:05.340
So it's a good thing.
 

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.678
In fact -- and the last thing
is also important.

00:09:09.678 --> 00:09:13.798
So they're opposing dipoles,
mostly, right?

00:09:13.798 --> 00:09:16.765
Carbon to oxygen is plus
towards carbon,

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:18.440
minus toward oxygen.
 

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.740
Carbon nitrogen,
plus toward carbon,

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.320
minus toward nitrogen.
 

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.001
But mostly those two are
opposed to one another,

00:09:25.001 --> 00:09:26.600
and a little bit they add.
 

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.034
So you get a net displacement
of positive/negative charge in

00:09:31.034 --> 00:09:33.440
the molecule,
from left to right,

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.320
positive to negative.
 

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.120
Okay?
 

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.408
That's what would happen if it
were a carbonyl and amine.

00:09:39.408 --> 00:09:42.009
But it's not a carbonyl and
amine.

00:09:42.009 --> 00:09:44.417
It's strongly dipolar,
not cancelled,

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:48.163
and it's in this direction,
perpendicular to the original

00:09:48.163 --> 00:09:49.100
direction.
 

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.783
Because you take electrons that
were on nitrogen in the amine,

00:09:52.783 --> 00:09:55.500
and you shift them into the
carbonyl group.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.154
So it's as if -- the magnitude
of that effect,

00:09:59.154 --> 00:10:03.461
is as if you transferred
one-third of an electron from

00:10:03.461 --> 00:10:05.330
nitrogen to oxygen.
 

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.038
If you did that,
you'd get as much displacement

00:10:08.038 --> 00:10:10.571
of charge, on average,
as there actually is.

00:10:10.571 --> 00:10:11.158
Right?
 

00:10:11.158 --> 00:10:15.583
Now, it turns out that all
these latter properties are

00:10:15.583 --> 00:10:18.340
crucial for structural biology.
 

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.125
We already saw that if you want
skin to work,

00:10:21.125 --> 00:10:23.090
it has to not be as reactive.
 

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:24.820
But these other things are
important too.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.471
The geometric things;
that nitrogen has to be planar

00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:31.570
and that there's a barrier to
rotation is very important.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:35.346
And also the dipolarity;
the direction of the dipole is

00:10:35.346 --> 00:10:36.210
very important.
 

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:37.610
And we'll show that.
 

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.210
So here's an amide bond.
 

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.309
Okay, the nitrogen is blue,
and the oxygen is red.

00:10:45.309 --> 00:10:46.330
You see the double bond.
 

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.895
But you shift electrons from
the nitrogen to the carbonyl

00:10:49.895 --> 00:10:52.769
group,
and that is the Ï€* --

00:10:52.769 --> 00:10:57.240
pardon me, that's the HOMO,
not the Ï€*,

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.080
it's the HOMO -- the
Ï€ electron pair,

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.461
which has shifted from nitrogen
and shared with the C double

00:11:04.461 --> 00:11:05.129
bond O.
 

00:11:05.129 --> 00:11:09.442
Now, that sharing,
as we just said on the previous

00:11:09.442 --> 00:11:12.610
slide, creates an electric
dipole.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.740
So the electrons are shifted in
the direction shown.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:16.879
And that's crucial.
 

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:20.971
Because here is a picture of a
helix, an Î±-helix of a

00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:24.500
protein, and I outline the
backbone of it there.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.590
Okay?
 

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.817
So several turns of an
Î±-helix,

00:11:27.817 --> 00:11:30.230
which has a lot of amide bonds
in it.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.070
And if we look at it,
we see there's an amide,

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:35.846
there's another amide,
there's another amide,

00:11:35.846 --> 00:11:38.750
all more or less on the top of
this helix.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:46.509
What's interesting about those?
 

00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:52.740
Andrew, what's interesting
about the set of them?

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.308
How are they lined up?
 

00:11:57.308 --> 00:12:01.001
Do you think it's favorable or
unfavorable, the way they're

00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:02.529
lined up: plus,
minus;

00:12:02.529 --> 00:12:05.940
plus, minus;
plus, minus, in a row?

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:06.418
Student:  Favorable.
 

00:12:06.418 --> 00:12:08.653
Prof: They're all lined
up so as to be attractive to

00:12:08.653 --> 00:12:09.038
another.
 

00:12:09.038 --> 00:12:11.759
So that stabilizes this
structure.

00:12:11.759 --> 00:12:14.668
In fact, another way of talking
about it is to say,

00:12:14.668 --> 00:12:17.389
as shown here by these
Î´s,

00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:19.830
that the oxygen is partially
minus,

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:23.051
and that the hydrogen attached
to the nitrogen is partially

00:12:23.051 --> 00:12:23.440
plus.
 

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.399
So getting this minus near that
plus is favorable.

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:29.019
What do you call that?
 

00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:30.720
Anybody know?
 

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.370
That is a hydrogen bond. Right?
 

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:38.176
So you have -- it's stabilized
by electrostatic interaction,

00:12:38.176 --> 00:12:39.658
these hydrogen bonds.
 

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:42.616
Not only there,
but there are other ones too,

00:12:42.616 --> 00:12:46.313
like here, a chain of them
there, and another chain down

00:12:46.313 --> 00:12:47.860
here at the bottom.
 

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:52.692
So this helix is stabilized by
the fact that the dipole points

00:12:52.692 --> 00:12:54.038
the way it did.
 

00:12:54.038 --> 00:12:56.961
If it pointed in the
perpendicular direction,

00:12:56.961 --> 00:12:59.220
you wouldn't get this
stability.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.399
Okay?
 

00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:03.658
And it's also stabilized by the
geometry that's favored,

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:07.020
the local planarity,
the fact that you don't twist

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:12.048
around the C-N double bond,
the partial double bond.

00:13:12.048 --> 00:13:13.808
So here's carbonyl,
here's the C-N,

00:13:13.808 --> 00:13:16.500
and that's -- although it's
written as a single bond,

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.210
it's partially a double bond.
 

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.500
So you don't twist about it.
 

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.120
So this atom,
this atom, this atom and this

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.179
atom are all in the same plane.
 

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:24.658
Right?
 

00:13:24.658 --> 00:13:28.624
And you see another such group
here, back behind,

00:13:28.624 --> 00:13:31.678
where here is the bond in
question.

00:13:31.678 --> 00:13:33.284
So this atom,
this atom, this atom,

00:13:33.284 --> 00:13:35.080
this atom are all in the same
plane.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.674
Or here at the bottom you see
it, where you're looking almost

00:13:39.674 --> 00:13:41.820
in the line -- in the plane.
 

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.509
Right?
 

00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:44.298
And what does that mean?
 

00:13:44.298 --> 00:13:47.034
It means that the backbone is
not as floppy,

00:13:47.034 --> 00:13:50.724
because you take away some of
the possibilities of twisting

00:13:50.724 --> 00:13:51.169
it.
 

00:13:51.169 --> 00:13:52.990
So it helps it take this shape.
 

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:57.130
So both the dipole,
and the geometrical freezing of

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:01.929
some of the single bonds,
means that this structure is

00:14:01.929 --> 00:14:07.375
particularly stable,
and therefore very prevalent in

00:14:07.375 --> 00:14:10.418
biological macromolecules.
 

00:14:10.418 --> 00:14:14.316
So that makes a lot of
difference, that amides are

00:14:14.316 --> 00:14:16.940
amides and not amine carbonyls.
 

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.100
Okay, now how about carboxylic
acids?

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.048
That's the next functional
group.

00:14:22.048 --> 00:14:25.409
So compared with what are these
acidic?

00:14:25.409 --> 00:14:27.879
Compared to alcohols.
 

00:14:27.879 --> 00:14:32.644
Because you might think that,
in the same way that an amide

00:14:32.644 --> 00:14:36.011
is an amine ketone,
you might think that a

00:14:36.011 --> 00:14:39.379
carboxylic acid is an alcohol
ketone.

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:40.970
But it's not. Right?
 

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:44.000
They interact with one another,
in much the same way.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.493
Now, if you had just a regular
old alcohol, it can dissociate

00:14:47.493 --> 00:14:48.250
as an acid.
 

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.389
It's not very strong as an acid.
 

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:52.206
You don't burn your skin with
it.

00:14:52.206 --> 00:14:52.659
Right?
 

00:14:52.659 --> 00:15:00.355
So it has a pKa of sixteen;
the dissociation constant is

00:15:00.355 --> 00:15:01.330
10^-16.
 

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.379
That's not very impressive.
 

00:15:03.379 --> 00:15:06.292
But for a carboxylic acid,
the reason it's called an acid,

00:15:06.292 --> 00:15:09.000
is because its pKa is much
lower, it's more acidic.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.350
The equilibrium constant is
10^-5.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.889
So it's acidic,
it's not an alcohol.

00:15:14.889 --> 00:15:18.746
It's 10^11 times stronger than
an alcohol.

00:15:18.746 --> 00:15:19.500
Right?
 

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.879
Now why?
 

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:25.741
Well just like an amide,
you have an unshared pair on

00:15:25.741 --> 00:15:29.221
the O-H oxygen,
which could be stabilized by

00:15:29.221 --> 00:15:32.970
the Ï€* orbital of the
C double-bond O.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.658
Now, if that stabilizes the
material on the left,

00:15:36.658 --> 00:15:40.350
how should it affect the
equilibrium constant?

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.830
Should it be more or less
acidic?

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:46.558
That is, because of this
interaction,

00:15:46.558 --> 00:15:48.950
because of this resonance
structure we could say,

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.668
because this pair of electrons
is stabilized by the carbonyl,

00:15:52.668 --> 00:15:55.120
there's a factor that's
stabilizing this,

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.570
which doesn't exist in the
alcohol.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:00.571
So you're stabilizing the
material on the left of the

00:16:00.571 --> 00:16:01.379
equilibrium.
 

00:16:01.379 --> 00:16:06.897
Would that tend to make it more
acidic, or tend to make it less

00:16:06.897 --> 00:16:10.190
acidic, if it's stable on the
left?

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:11.033
Prof: Right?
 

00:16:11.033 --> 00:16:13.831
So you have -- here's the stuff
on the left, here's the stuff on

00:16:13.831 --> 00:16:14.409
the right.
 

00:16:14.409 --> 00:16:15.710
It's uphill in energy.
 

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.725
No matter what you're talking
about, it's hard to dissociate

00:16:18.725 --> 00:16:19.389
as an acid.
 

00:16:19.389 --> 00:16:20.528
Right?
 

00:16:20.528 --> 00:16:24.038
So I make this more stable,
which is what I just showed.

00:16:24.038 --> 00:16:27.673
There's resonance here that
stabilizes this HOMO/LUMO mixing

00:16:27.673 --> 00:16:29.028
within the molecule.
 

00:16:29.028 --> 00:16:32.690
Does that make it more or less
easy to dissociate?

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.340
Harder or easier?
 

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:34.879
Student:  Harder.
 

00:16:34.879 --> 00:16:36.990
Prof: Harder. Right?
 

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:38.490
It's further uphill.
 

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.649
So this seems backwards.
 

00:16:40.649 --> 00:16:46.235
The analog of the stabilization
we saw in an amide that makes

00:16:46.235 --> 00:16:51.168
your skin not dissolve,
has the opposite direction.

00:16:51.168 --> 00:16:54.666
It predicts that the
dissociation would be more

00:16:54.666 --> 00:16:57.250
uphill, where in fact it's less.
 

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.509
Why?
 

00:16:59.509 --> 00:17:03.570
Because if we look at the
product, you also have HOMO/LUMO

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:07.772
interaction, between an unshared
pair on this oxygen and the

00:17:07.772 --> 00:17:08.700
carbonyl.
 

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.512
And that will stabilize it on
the right and make it easier to

00:17:12.512 --> 00:17:13.338
dissociate.
 

00:17:13.338 --> 00:17:16.730
Which should be more important,
the amount of extra

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:18.630
stabilization on the left?
 

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:22.220
Here's what it was for an
alcohol, originally.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:27.548
We stabilize it on the left and
we stabilize it on the right.

00:17:27.548 --> 00:17:34.333
Which is more stabilized,
the carboxylate or the original

00:17:34.333 --> 00:17:38.210
alcohol - the carboxylic acid.
 

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:41.750
What do you know from the fact
that it's more acidic;

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.589
which must have gone down
further?

00:17:44.589 --> 00:17:45.390
Student:  That one.
 

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:46.490
Prof: This one must've
gone down further.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:47.900
Can you see why?
 

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:53.895
Why would this one be more
stabilized by HOMO/LUMO mixing,

00:17:53.895 --> 00:17:58.946
that is, this be more
important, than it is here,

00:17:58.946 --> 00:18:00.420
with that?
 

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.410
Lucas?
 

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:03.470
Student:  Symmetry.
 

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.259
Prof: No.
 

00:18:05.259 --> 00:18:06.390
Becky?
 

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.990
Student:  Because of bad
charge separation.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.835
Prof: Okay,
there's bad charge separation

00:18:10.835 --> 00:18:11.108
here.
 

00:18:11.108 --> 00:18:13.940
Here, on the right,
you don't separate charge.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.068
That may have been part of what
Lucas was trying to say.

00:18:17.068 --> 00:18:20.102
But there's another way you can
say it, just in terms of

00:18:20.102 --> 00:18:21.150
HOMO/LUMO mixing.
 

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:25.008
The language you're using is
the language of resonance --

00:18:25.008 --> 00:18:25.558
right?
 

00:18:25.558 --> 00:18:27.318
-- that you don't want to
separate charge.

00:18:27.318 --> 00:18:30.453
I want to see why,
in terms of molecular orbital

00:18:30.453 --> 00:18:34.056
energies, or atomic orbital
energies, that you get more

00:18:34.056 --> 00:18:35.589
stabilization here.
 

00:18:35.589 --> 00:18:37.368
Alex?
 

00:18:37.368 --> 00:18:40.056
Student:  There's an
electron pair that moves into an

00:18:40.056 --> 00:18:41.392
antibonding --
Prof: Right,

00:18:41.392 --> 00:18:42.308
but that's true in both cases.
 

00:18:42.308 --> 00:18:44.807
There's an electron pair here
that mixes with a vacant

00:18:44.807 --> 00:18:45.279
orbital.
 

00:18:45.279 --> 00:18:48.770
There's an electron pair here
that mixes with a vacant

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:49.430
orbital.
 

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.519
Why is it more effective here
than it is here?

00:18:52.519 --> 00:18:56.009
Claire?
 

00:18:56.009 --> 00:18:58.970
Student:  Just guessing,
but if the resonance,

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.140
for the two structures on the
left,

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.294
when the resonance comes down
to the O-H bond it's

00:19:04.294 --> 00:19:05.259
anti-bonding.
 

00:19:05.259 --> 00:19:09.539
But with the other one,
because the H isn't there,

00:19:09.539 --> 00:19:12.858
it's actually making it more
stable.

00:19:12.858 --> 00:19:16.420
Prof: I'd have to think
about that awhile.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:22.077
But I want you to try again,
in terms of the -- what makes

00:19:22.077 --> 00:19:24.559
HOMO/LUMO mixings good?
 

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:27.190
What makes them important?
 

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:28.490
Student:  If there's a
higher one over.

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:29.470
Prof: Overlap.
 

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.269
Student:  Overlap.
 

00:19:31.269 --> 00:19:31.730
Prof: That's the same in
both cases.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:34.680
It's the same oxygen reacting
-- mixing with the same double

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.029
bond.
 

00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:36.750
And what else?
 

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.630
Student:  If there's a
high HOMO --

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.318
Prof: If it's a high
HOMO.

00:19:40.318 --> 00:19:45.859
The HOMO here is an unshared
pair on oxygen.

00:19:45.859 --> 00:19:46.848
Student:  Right.
 

00:19:46.848 --> 00:19:50.230
Prof: The HOMO here is
an unshared pair on oxygen.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:51.338
Are they the same?
 

00:19:51.338 --> 00:19:53.916
Student:  No,
because the HOMO on the left is

00:19:53.916 --> 00:19:55.029
taken up b hydrogen.
 

00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:56.269
Prof: Right, okay.
 

00:19:56.269 --> 00:19:58.394
So the one on the left has
another proton,

00:19:58.394 --> 00:19:59.690
which this one doesn't.
 

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:03.035
That means that the electrons
here are more stable,

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:04.240
lower in energy.
 

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.650
And this is a higher HOMO,
which is associated (another

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:11.185
way of saying the same thing)
with the fact that that's a

00:20:11.185 --> 00:20:12.450
negative charge.
 

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:15.257
When you have a negative
charge, it's a bad place to put

00:20:15.257 --> 00:20:15.869
electrons.
 

00:20:15.869 --> 00:20:17.528
They are high in energy.
 

00:20:17.528 --> 00:20:20.194
Another way of saying it,
and the way you said it,

00:20:20.194 --> 00:20:22.535
which is probably a better way
of saying it,

00:20:22.535 --> 00:20:25.308
is that the proton is gone,
so it's not stable.

00:20:25.308 --> 00:20:28.979
So you expect more HOMO/LUMO
mixing here because of better

00:20:28.979 --> 00:20:31.038
energy match than on the left.
 

00:20:31.038 --> 00:20:36.096
Therefore, the observation,
that it's 10^11 times stronger

00:20:36.096 --> 00:20:37.250
as an acid.
 

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:41.323
So it's a higher HOMO,
because of that negative

00:20:41.323 --> 00:20:44.598
charge, or the absence of a
proton.

00:20:44.598 --> 00:20:47.190
Okay, so there's our carboxylic
acid.

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:50.934
And finally the last functional
group we wanted to talk about

00:20:50.934 --> 00:20:53.618
today, which is a really
complicated one.

00:20:53.618 --> 00:20:56.575
It starts very simple,
but you'll see it gets pretty

00:20:56.575 --> 00:20:58.140
baroque pretty soon here.
 

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.140
So it's methyl lithium.
 

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.813
And the chance of your figuring
all this stuff out ahead of time

00:21:04.813 --> 00:21:05.852
is about zero.
 

00:21:05.852 --> 00:21:06.519
Right?
 

00:21:06.519 --> 00:21:09.617
So don't be depressed if this
looks like it's getting very

00:21:09.617 --> 00:21:10.380
complicated.
 

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.769
Remember, there are three
approaches here.

00:21:12.769 --> 00:21:15.250
One is to draw lines,
à la Lewis,

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.858
to understand how things come
together.

00:21:17.858 --> 00:21:21.950
Another one is to use a
computer to generate molecular

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:24.652
orbitals;
to break the total electron

00:21:24.652 --> 00:21:28.700
distribution into orbitals and
look at them one at a time.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.935
And having seen what the
computer produces,

00:21:31.935 --> 00:21:35.250
some of those orbitals are
interpretable;

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.498
as we've seen,
that they're antibonding in a

00:21:37.498 --> 00:21:39.747
certain region,
bonding in a certain region,

00:21:39.747 --> 00:21:40.480
and so on.
 

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.201
But the chances of your
competing with the computer in

00:21:44.201 --> 00:21:47.009
drawing accurate molecular
orbitals --

00:21:47.009 --> 00:21:49.568
to the extent that molecular
orbitals are real --

00:21:49.568 --> 00:21:53.141
the chance of your competing
with the computer is not very

00:21:53.141 --> 00:21:53.578
good.
 

00:21:53.578 --> 00:21:56.430
So don't expect that you can
exactly draw them.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:00.275
But if you see the one that the
computer has drawn,

00:22:00.275 --> 00:22:04.890
at least in some cases you can
make some guesses about it.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.808
You can see how many nodes it
has;

00:22:07.808 --> 00:22:10.463
whether there are nuclei in the
middle of lobes,

00:22:10.463 --> 00:22:12.779
which would make that a stable
orbital;

00:22:12.779 --> 00:22:15.519
where it's bonding;
where it's antibonding.

00:22:15.519 --> 00:22:18.241
Those kinds of things you can
analyze, even though you can't

00:22:18.241 --> 00:22:19.348
produce them yourself.
 

00:22:19.348 --> 00:22:21.709
So don't think that you're
going to be able to.

00:22:21.709 --> 00:22:22.118
Right?
 

00:22:22.118 --> 00:22:26.111
But then there's another point
of view, which is to look at

00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:28.587
localized pairs,
bonds and antibonds,

00:22:28.587 --> 00:22:30.653
and how they'll come together.
 

00:22:30.653 --> 00:22:31.410
Right?
 

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:33.000
And that you can do.
 

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.471
That's the intermediate between
using just Lewis and doing the

00:22:37.471 --> 00:22:40.328
full molecular orbital kind of
thing.

00:22:40.328 --> 00:22:43.142
This is something you can do in
your head, and that's what we're

00:22:43.142 --> 00:22:45.105
going to show,
these different points of view

00:22:45.105 --> 00:22:45.910
with this one.
 

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:47.509
So here's methyl lithium.
 

00:22:47.509 --> 00:22:51.328
Now what will make methyl
lithium reactive?

00:22:51.328 --> 00:23:00.329
What's a high HOMO of methyl
lithium?

00:23:00.329 --> 00:23:01.868
Marty?
 

00:23:01.868 --> 00:23:06.028
What makes HOMOs -- what makes
for a high HOMO?

00:23:06.028 --> 00:23:08.028
What kinds of things do you
think about?

00:23:08.028 --> 00:23:13.118
Student:
&gt;

00:23:13.118 --> 00:23:14.470
Prof: Can't hear very
well.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:18.261
Student:  Like what the
outlines on the slide were

00:23:18.261 --> 00:23:21.655
before, unshared pairs and --
Prof: Just with a pair

00:23:21.655 --> 00:23:22.078
of atoms.
 

00:23:22.078 --> 00:23:24.711
I'm not trying to make like our
slide before where you're doing

00:23:24.711 --> 00:23:25.900
all the complicated stuff.
 

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.660
But just you have two atoms and
they come together.

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.170
Will they give a very high HOMO?
 

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:38.381
What determines how far they go
up and down, the HOMO and the

00:23:38.381 --> 00:23:39.338
LUMO?
 

00:23:39.338 --> 00:23:41.430
What's one thing that
determines it?

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:42.150
Student:  Oh,
the overlap.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:42.950
Prof: Overlap.
 

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:43.480
Okay.
 

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.326
So here are two atoms that are
coming right together,

00:23:45.326 --> 00:23:46.319
to a single bond distance.
 

00:23:46.319 --> 00:23:47.410
So good overlap.
 

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:49.930
Let's suppose it's the same as
all overlaps.

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:51.089
Okay?
 

00:23:51.089 --> 00:23:54.970
What else?
 

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:57.759
What is it besides overlap that
determines how far they go?

00:23:57.759 --> 00:23:58.368
Student:  Energy
difference.

00:23:58.368 --> 00:23:59.731
Prof: The energy match.
 

00:23:59.731 --> 00:24:00.048
Right?
 

00:24:00.048 --> 00:24:07.720
Now what's special about methyl
lithium?

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.299
Methyl's not going to be funny
-- that's our standard thing --

00:24:11.299 --> 00:24:12.650
but lithium is funny.
 

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:14.480
Where is it on the periodic
table?

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.880
Maybe that's the problem we're
having.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.805
Student:  It's on the --
Prof: On the far left,

00:24:19.805 --> 00:24:22.828
which means it doesn't have a
very big nuclear charge.

00:24:22.828 --> 00:24:26.095
So does that mean electrons are
going to like being there or not

00:24:26.095 --> 00:24:27.078
like being there?
 

00:24:27.078 --> 00:24:28.130
Student:  They're going
to not like being there.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.230
Prof: Because it's not
much nuclear charge.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.115
So it's going to be a bad
energy match,

00:24:31.115 --> 00:24:31.808
high energy.
 

00:24:31.808 --> 00:24:34.779
So there's going to be a high
HOMO.

00:24:34.779 --> 00:24:35.480
Right?
 

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.884
The HOMO here,
from the carbon,

00:24:36.884 --> 00:24:39.270
doesn't go down very much,
because of the bad energy

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:39.740
match.
 

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.450
Okay?
 

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:43.319
So there's an unusually high
HOMO.

00:24:43.319 --> 00:24:44.338
What will it look like?
 

00:24:44.338 --> 00:24:47.604
Where will it be,
on the carbon or on the

00:24:47.604 --> 00:24:48.420
lithium?
 

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.920
Student:  The HOMO?
 

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.480
Prof: The HOMO.
 

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.568
Student:  It'll be on
the first one.

00:24:56.568 --> 00:24:58.935
Prof: Is it going to be
symmetrical, or is it going to

00:24:58.935 --> 00:25:00.750
be more Carbon,
or going to be more Lithium?

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.130
Student:  More carbon
because --

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:02.880
Prof: More on the carbon.
 

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.019
That's the lower one.
 

00:25:04.019 --> 00:25:04.618
Okay?
 

00:25:04.618 --> 00:25:06.960
So if we want to look at the
HOMO of this thing,

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.940
it's going to be mostly on
carbon, not so much on lithium,

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.890
and an unusually high HOMO
because of the lithium.

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:15.368
And there it is,
that's the HOMO.

00:25:15.368 --> 00:25:18.170
Marty, you're going to finish
us here by saying what orbital

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:19.118
does it look like?
 

00:25:19.118 --> 00:25:22.519
Student:  It looks like
--

00:25:22.519 --> 00:25:23.920
Prof: I'll back up.
 

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.509
There it is and there's the
orbital.

00:25:26.509 --> 00:25:27.750
Student:  2 p-ish.
 

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.853
Prof: It's a 2p
orbital on carbon,

00:25:29.853 --> 00:25:30.166
mostly.
 

00:25:30.166 --> 00:25:30.568
Right?
 

00:25:30.568 --> 00:25:33.410
With just a little bit of
lithium, 1s,

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:35.539
or 2s,
pardon me, on it.

00:25:35.539 --> 00:25:37.328
But just a teeny bit of lithium.
 

00:25:37.328 --> 00:25:39.828
And it's antibonding between
the lithium and the carbon.

00:25:39.828 --> 00:25:42.436
It's the -- or no,
no, wait, it must be a p

00:25:42.436 --> 00:25:45.096
orbital on lithium,
because it's the favorable one,

00:25:45.096 --> 00:25:46.798
it's the bonding one,
right?

00:25:46.798 --> 00:25:50.534
We see the blue of lithium,
but there's a little red on the

00:25:50.534 --> 00:25:53.752
other side that we don't see,
without making a net,

00:25:53.752 --> 00:25:55.170
which I didn't do.
 

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.079
Okay, so that's the HOMO.
 

00:25:57.079 --> 00:25:58.519
It's a Ïƒ.
 

00:25:58.519 --> 00:26:02.690
Now what will the LUMO be?
 

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:04.180
Kate, what do you say?
 

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:08.440
What do you think for a LUMO,
of methyl lithium?

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.660
Student:  It's going to
be a p orbital.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:11.608
Prof: Can't hear very
well.

00:26:11.608 --> 00:26:13.160
Student:  Lithium
orbital --

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.342
Prof: Yes,
lithium has a lot of vacant

00:26:15.342 --> 00:26:16.383
orbitals on the atom.
 

00:26:16.383 --> 00:26:16.828
Right?
 

00:26:16.828 --> 00:26:19.558
It comes in with only one
valence electron.

00:26:19.558 --> 00:26:22.538
Only one of its four valence
orbitals is occupied.

00:26:22.538 --> 00:26:25.509
So it's got,
in fact, three vacant orbitals.

00:26:25.509 --> 00:26:27.088
So that's going to be a LUMO.
 

00:26:27.088 --> 00:26:30.589
There's the LUMO,
mostly on the lithium.

00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:33.019
Okay?
 

00:26:33.019 --> 00:26:37.657
Now, but the LUMO+1 is this
orbital, which I've drawn in a

00:26:37.657 --> 00:26:42.213
funny way, at a relatively high
electron density contour,

00:26:42.213 --> 00:26:44.900
making the things very small.
 

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:48.044
Because if I made them bigger
it goes way off the top of the

00:26:48.044 --> 00:26:50.230
sheet and off the bottom of the
sheet,

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:52.950
because this orbital isn't held
very tightly by lithium,

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:54.740
it sticks way out.
 

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.596
And it turns out to be out of
the range that gets plotted by

00:26:58.596 --> 00:26:59.250
Spartan.
 

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.690
So you get funny looking holes
in the orbital.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:03.380
So I chose this particular
density.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.267
But anyhow, you see it's a
p orbital,

00:27:06.267 --> 00:27:09.019
that's different signs,
top and bottom.

00:27:09.019 --> 00:27:17.529
Now, so you have a -- is this
an unusually low LUMO?

00:27:17.529 --> 00:27:21.579
Monique, what do you say?
 

00:27:21.579 --> 00:27:22.818
Let me tell you something.
 

00:27:22.818 --> 00:27:26.215
I'd say lithium has a small
nuclear charge,

00:27:26.215 --> 00:27:29.530
not a very good place for
electrons to be.

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:30.338
Right?
 

00:27:30.338 --> 00:27:35.608
Which means that it's going to
be a very high orbital energy.

00:27:35.608 --> 00:27:42.000
Can you see any contrary things
that say it might be unusually

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:42.630
low?
 

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:43.900
Student:  I would think
it would be high.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:44.640
Prof: Can't hear very
well.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.868
Student:  I would think
it would be high.

00:27:46.868 --> 00:27:48.539
Prof: Because of the low
nuclear charge?

00:27:48.539 --> 00:27:49.309
Student:  Yes.
 

00:27:49.309 --> 00:27:50.509
Prof: Compared to what?
 

00:27:50.509 --> 00:27:53.471
What are we comparing with,
to say whether orbitals are

00:27:53.471 --> 00:27:54.240
high or low?
 

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.670
Student:  To a Carbon or
H.

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:59.342
Prof: The carbon-carbon,
or carbon-Hydrogen

00:27:59.342 --> 00:28:02.339
Ïƒ and
Ïƒ* bonds.

00:28:02.339 --> 00:28:03.088
Right?
 

00:28:03.088 --> 00:28:07.367
So clearly enough the carbon
and hydrogen start lower in

00:28:07.367 --> 00:28:13.950
energy than the lithium does;
but what?

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:15.868
But they have big overlap.
 

00:28:15.868 --> 00:28:19.468
So Ïƒ* is quite
high, much higher than lithium,

00:28:19.468 --> 00:28:23.252
because it's an atomic orbital,
it hasn't mixed with anything,

00:28:23.252 --> 00:28:24.058
this one.
 

00:28:24.058 --> 00:28:28.943
Okay, so methyl lithium has an
unusually low vacant orbital and

00:28:28.943 --> 00:28:31.859
an unusually high occupied
orbital.

00:28:31.859 --> 00:28:34.500
And what do you expect?
 

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.025
Prof: You ever seen a
case like this before where the

00:28:37.025 --> 00:28:38.940
same molecule was --
Student:  BH_3.

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:42.022
Prof: BH_3,
for exactly the same reason,

00:28:42.022 --> 00:28:42.558
right?
 

00:28:42.558 --> 00:28:45.440
Except more so,
because lithium is more so than

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:49.009
boron, being further to the left
in the periodic table.

00:28:49.009 --> 00:28:51.923
So we can put two of these
things, above,

00:28:51.923 --> 00:28:56.295
up and down from one another,
like this, and have the HOMO of

00:28:56.295 --> 00:28:59.720
one be stabilized by the LUMO of
the other.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.750
Kevin?
 

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:04.163
Student:  Sorry,
could you please explain again

00:29:04.163 --> 00:29:05.710
why it has a low LUMO?
 

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:06.250
Prof: Yes.
 

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:08.250
Because it's an atomic orbital.
 

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:10.309
It's not a molecular orbital,
it's not a bonding orbital.

00:29:10.309 --> 00:29:11.730
It didn't mix with anything.
 

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:15.877
The things we're comparing with
are not carbon and hydrogen,

00:29:15.877 --> 00:29:18.618
which are in fact lower than
lithium.

00:29:18.618 --> 00:29:21.555
It's the Ïƒ and
Ïƒ* bonds of carbon

00:29:21.555 --> 00:29:24.307
and hydrogen which --
and this, the LUMO here is

00:29:24.307 --> 00:29:27.400
higher than that of lithium --
lithium's unusually low --

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.200
because it's still an atomic
orbital,

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.619
it didn't mix with anything.
 

00:29:31.619 --> 00:29:32.338
Okay?
 

00:29:32.338 --> 00:29:35.348
So there's stabilization of the
Ïƒ by the

00:29:35.348 --> 00:29:36.160
Ï€.
 

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:39.657
But at the same time we can go
the other way and the HOMO on

00:29:39.657 --> 00:29:42.859
the top can be stabilized by the
LUMO on the bottom.

00:29:42.859 --> 00:29:47.619
Same as in BH_3, giving B_2H_6.
 

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:49.630
Okay, so these things dimerize.
 

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:52.238
They come together,
HOMO of one stabilizing the

00:29:52.238 --> 00:29:54.279
LUMO of the other,
and vice-versa.

00:29:54.279 --> 00:29:57.252
They move together,
and you get a thing that looks

00:29:57.252 --> 00:29:59.498
like that, very much like
B_2H_6_.

00:29:59.498 --> 00:30:00.528
 Right?
 

00:30:00.528 --> 00:30:05.906
So you have two vacant lithium
orbitals, stabilizing the

00:30:05.906 --> 00:30:08.450
unshared pair of carbon.
 

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:10.190
You can think of it that way.
 

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:14.542
And it also goes the other way,
the unshared pair on that

00:30:14.542 --> 00:30:18.119
carbon is stabilized by two
vacant lithiums.

00:30:18.119 --> 00:30:19.970
Okay?
 

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:22.809
So these are three-center
two-electron bonds;

00:30:22.809 --> 00:30:25.259
just as in B_2H_6.
 

00:30:25.259 --> 00:30:29.556
Okay now, but remember,
lithium has two other vacant

00:30:29.556 --> 00:30:31.410
orbitals, each atom.
 

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.078
We've only used one here. Right?
 

00:30:34.078 --> 00:30:37.108
So they can combine to give
this.

00:30:37.108 --> 00:30:39.690
This is actually the LUMO of
that dimer.

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:40.220
Right?
 

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.442
Those are in the plane of the
four-membered ring.

00:30:43.442 --> 00:30:43.980
Right?
 

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.059
And there are other vacant
orbitals too,

00:30:47.059 --> 00:30:49.211
like this Ï€ one,
which is in and out from that

00:30:49.211 --> 00:30:51.696
four-membered ring,
made up of p orbitals on

00:30:51.696 --> 00:30:52.348
the lithium.
 

00:30:52.348 --> 00:30:57.720
That's the LUMO+1,
of that dimer.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.430
Okay, now I'm going to rotate
this.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:03.894
Now, pay attention here because
the next picture's a little

00:31:03.894 --> 00:31:04.818
confusing.
 

00:31:04.818 --> 00:31:09.189
I'm going to rotate this thing
so that we're looking just a

00:31:09.189 --> 00:31:11.957
little bit --
we're looking mostly in the

00:31:11.957 --> 00:31:14.930
plane of the molecule but
twisted a little bit,

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:17.068
so we can still see the top of
the molecule.

00:31:17.068 --> 00:31:21.215
And we're going to twist it
such that the red lobe in back

00:31:21.215 --> 00:31:23.690
is behind the red lobe in front.
 

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:28.329
So what we're going to do is
rotate around that axis and

00:31:28.329 --> 00:31:33.140
shift it a little bit toward the
center of the picture.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.740
So it's that same orbital.
 

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.210
And there it is now.
 

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:39.330
But it's a little confusing in
the middle because there's one

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.619
red lobe in the back and one in
the front.

00:31:41.619 --> 00:31:42.430
Okay?
 

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:46.288
We could draw it down -- okay,
so that's what it is.

00:31:46.288 --> 00:31:50.961
But we're going to drop an axis
that goes right through the

00:31:50.961 --> 00:31:53.460
middle of that parallelogram.
 

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.779
Okay?
 

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:58.967
And now along that axis we're
going to bring up another

00:31:58.967 --> 00:31:59.818
molecule.
 

00:31:59.818 --> 00:32:03.058
But it's going to be rotated
90º.

00:32:03.058 --> 00:32:09.118
So those are the same two
orbitals, LUMO+1 in both cases.

00:32:09.118 --> 00:32:12.344
The one on the bottom is
rotated 90º

00:32:12.344 --> 00:32:14.359
around the axis I drew.
 

00:32:14.359 --> 00:32:15.150
Okay?
 

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:22.660
Now will those things interact
favorably with one another?

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.058
First, they're orthogonal.
 

00:32:25.058 --> 00:32:27.440
And second, even if they mixed
you wouldn't care.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.230
Why?
 

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:30.098
Prof: Because they're
vacant.

00:32:30.098 --> 00:32:33.467
So what we want to do is look
at the bottom,

00:32:33.467 --> 00:32:34.720
not at LUMO+1.
 

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.303
We want to look at the HOMO of
that one, that dimer,

00:32:38.303 --> 00:32:39.990
which looks like this.
 

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:45.471
And now you see something neat,
that the blue in front overlaps

00:32:45.471 --> 00:32:49.717
the blue vacant one,
and the red in back overlaps

00:32:49.717 --> 00:32:52.368
the behind red vacant one.
 

00:32:52.368 --> 00:32:55.980
So the electrons in the HOMO on
the bottom get stabilized,

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:58.769
by overlapping with the LUMO+1
on the top.

00:32:58.769 --> 00:33:01.673
And, of course,
by the same token,

00:33:01.673 --> 00:33:06.515
the HOMO of the one on top
overlaps with the LUMO of the

00:33:06.515 --> 00:33:09.420
one on the bottom,
like that.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:14.440
So we already had two molecules
come together to form dimers.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.734
Now we're having two dimers
come together to form a

00:33:17.734 --> 00:33:18.460
tetramer.
 

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:19.190
Yoonjoo?
 

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:21.759
Student:  Why are we
using LUMO+1 on the right?

00:33:21.759 --> 00:33:24.159
Prof: Ah,
because that's the one that

00:33:24.159 --> 00:33:25.220
does the overlap.
 

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:29.440
The actual LUMO doesn't overlap
this one on the bottom.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.349
Okay?
 

00:33:31.349 --> 00:33:31.808
Lucas?
 

00:33:31.808 --> 00:33:34.896
Student:  Does that make
the LUMO+1 essentially the new

00:33:34.896 --> 00:33:36.769
LUMO, because it's more
stabilized?

00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:39.250
Prof: Well,
but it mixes with this one.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:42.509
So the LUMO+1 and this one
interact.

00:33:42.509 --> 00:33:43.670
Here's the HOMO.
 

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:44.539
Student:  And they make
it better --

00:33:44.539 --> 00:33:47.548
Prof: LUMO+1.
 

00:33:47.548 --> 00:33:52.390
So it contributes to this one.
 

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:53.519
Right?
 

00:33:53.519 --> 00:33:56.059
When the HOMO here,
of the dimer,

00:33:56.059 --> 00:33:59.315
mixed with the LUMO+1,
of the other dimer,

00:33:59.315 --> 00:34:01.298
you've got a mixture.
 

00:34:01.298 --> 00:34:04.259
This one looks mostly like the
HOMO of this dimer.

00:34:04.259 --> 00:34:06.527
But it's a little bit helped
out by looking like the LUMO of

00:34:06.527 --> 00:34:06.950
this one.
 

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:09.250
There's a new vacant orbital,
but it's still higher.

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:12.119
You don't care about that one
anymore.

00:34:12.119 --> 00:34:15.989
Okay, so now we can take two of
these and bring them together.

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:19.860
That's a bonding,
the orbitals we just showed.

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:26.719
And you get a cube. Right?
 

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:29.418
So here's the one on the
bottom, one, two,

00:34:29.418 --> 00:34:31.657
three, four;
and here's the one on the top,

00:34:31.657 --> 00:34:32.670
one, two, three,
four.

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:35.264
And they've been turned
90º, to line up these

00:34:35.264 --> 00:34:38.336
orbitals, and they come together
and the electrons get more

00:34:38.336 --> 00:34:38.920
stable.
 

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:42.007
Now that used,
on every lithium,

00:34:42.007 --> 00:34:45.393
another one of its vacant
orbitals.

00:34:45.393 --> 00:34:46.389
Right?
 

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:48.030
But what Angela?
 

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:48.840
Student:  There's
another one.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.650
Prof: There's another
one.

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:51.190
Okay.
 

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:54.559
So the HOMO now turns out to be
this.

00:34:54.559 --> 00:34:58.047
And you can understand that,
the biggest part of it,

00:34:58.047 --> 00:35:01.809
by seeing that it's a
four-center, two-electron bond.

00:35:01.809 --> 00:35:04.641
Mostly it's a p orbital,
or a hybrid orbital of the

00:35:04.641 --> 00:35:07.097
carbon,
an unshared pair of carbon,

00:35:07.097 --> 00:35:11.230
but it's stabilized by three
vacant orbitals of lithium.

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:14.965
So three vacant lithium atomic
orbitals stabilized the unshared

00:35:14.965 --> 00:35:15.989
pair of carbon.
 

00:35:15.989 --> 00:35:20.340
But, as Angela points out here,
there's another one.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:24.150
That's still a vacant orbital
on lithium.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:25.440
That's on the top lithium.
 

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.050
There are other ones on the
other three lithiums.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:32.786
So we need more electrons -- or
it's capable of stabilizing more

00:35:32.786 --> 00:35:33.690
electrons.
 

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:35.380
Where do you get them?
 

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.130
Well you might think you bring
another cube up.

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:40.590
But in fact there's something
easier to do,

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:45.045
because this is done in
solution, and the solvent is

00:35:45.045 --> 00:35:47.300
dimethyl ether,
as shown here,

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:51.036
or some other ether,
which has an unshared pair of

00:35:51.036 --> 00:35:53.771
electrons,
and it comes along and gets

00:35:53.771 --> 00:35:54.980
stabilized by that.
 

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:58.293
But at the same time the other
three oxygens,

00:35:58.293 --> 00:36:02.661
the other orange balls -- the
other three lithiums I should

00:36:02.661 --> 00:36:06.050
say -- stabilize oxygens of
other ethers.

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:09.516
So you have four ether
molecules associated with a

00:36:09.516 --> 00:36:11.570
tetramer of methyl lithium.
 

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:16.677
And this is about as complex as
we're ever going to get.

00:36:16.677 --> 00:36:17.420
Right?
 

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:20.900
So I think you would've had a
hard time, at the outset,

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:22.059
predicting this.
 

00:36:22.059 --> 00:36:25.050
But having seen it,
I think you can understand it.

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:27.860
That's what we're aiming for at
this stage.

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:31.844
Because as we go on and get
lore, that this reacts with this

00:36:31.844 --> 00:36:34.416
and gives this,
what I want you to be able to

00:36:34.416 --> 00:36:37.572
do is to look at it and say,
ah ha, that's what happened,

00:36:37.572 --> 00:36:39.699
that's why that reacted that
way.

00:36:39.699 --> 00:36:42.750
In some cases you'll be able to
predict.

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:46.027
But in other cases you'll be
able to understand and correlate

00:36:46.027 --> 00:36:47.340
it with what you know.
 

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:52.409
So if you put more ether in,
if you have a lot of excess

00:36:52.409 --> 00:36:56.190
ether, then it rips these things
apart.

00:36:56.190 --> 00:37:00.103
So it can fly apart and you get
a bunch of ethers on every

00:37:00.103 --> 00:37:00.789
lithium.
 

00:37:00.789 --> 00:37:01.349
All right?
 

00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:08.784
And in fact this is a further
development of organic

00:37:08.784 --> 00:37:12.722
chemistry,
beyond what we usually do in an

00:37:12.722 --> 00:37:15.711
elementary course,
which is to understand the

00:37:15.711 --> 00:37:17.320
non-bonded interactions.
 

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:20.215
Because often you wouldn't
consider that oxygen-lithium to

00:37:20.215 --> 00:37:21.079
be a real bond.
 

00:37:21.079 --> 00:37:23.949
It's just sort of a weak
solvation thing;

00:37:23.949 --> 00:37:26.090
although truly it is a bond.
 

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:26.780
Okay?
 

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:29.826
So these so-called non-bonded
interactions and the effects of

00:37:29.826 --> 00:37:32.670
solvent are a vital part of
lore, what solvent you choose

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:33.940
for a given reaction.
 

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:36.029
For example,
if you want to facilitate

00:37:36.029 --> 00:37:39.530
ionization, you use certain
solvents and not other solvents.

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:41.170
And we'll talk about that a
little bit.

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:44.086
But I just want to show you
what there is out there,

00:37:44.086 --> 00:37:47.119
beyond the bonding that we've
already talked about.

00:37:47.119 --> 00:37:49.717
But we've really taken theory
pretty far here,

00:37:49.717 --> 00:37:52.949
in the first half of the first
semester of the course.

00:37:52.949 --> 00:37:56.139
Now, I said we would vote.
 

00:37:56.139 --> 00:37:58.239
And I forgot to bring a piece
of paper.

00:37:58.239 --> 00:38:01.420
I have this piece of paper,
but I'm not going to use it for

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.780
that, because this is the thank
you note.

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:06.365
So if you want to -- if you
haven't signed it -- why don't

00:38:06.365 --> 00:38:07.320
you pass it around?
 

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.929
Because there are a few people
who haven't signed it.

00:38:08.929 --> 00:38:10.746
Let's pass it down,
back and forth,

00:38:10.746 --> 00:38:11.710
down the aisles.
 

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:13.500
I think most people have signed
it, but some haven't.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.989
You don't have to.
 

00:38:14.989 --> 00:38:16.619
And you also don't have to
contribute.

00:38:16.619 --> 00:38:20.297
But if you want to be -- have a
sense of satisfaction of having

00:38:20.297 --> 00:38:23.797
contributed to the class gift,
you can leave a small coin on

00:38:23.797 --> 00:38:25.280
the table over there.
 

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.121
Okay, but the other business we
have to transact is I'm going to

00:38:29.121 --> 00:38:31.559
give a review session before the
exam.

00:38:31.559 --> 00:38:33.500
But it's not obvious when we
should give it.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:37.574
So I've decided that the
easiest thing to do is to see

00:38:37.574 --> 00:38:42.032
how many people cannot -- of
course we want people not only

00:38:42.032 --> 00:38:43.954
that can, but would come.
 

00:38:43.954 --> 00:38:44.800
Right?
 

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.309
If you could come but wouldn't,
you're irrelevant.

00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:53.596
So the question is,
how many people cannot -- or

00:38:53.596 --> 00:38:58.246
would come, other times,
but cannot come at the time

00:38:58.246 --> 00:38:59.159
shown?
 

00:38:59.159 --> 00:39:01.309
And the one that has the fewest
will win.

00:39:01.309 --> 00:39:04.210
That make sense?
 

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:10.552
Okay, so how many people cannot
come Thursday evening,

00:39:10.552 --> 00:39:11.389
8:00?
 

00:39:11.389 --> 00:39:12.550
That's too many.
 

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:17.380
How many at 8:30?
 

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:23.329
Here we have about,
my judge is about fifteen.

00:39:23.329 --> 00:39:30.039
How many cannot come Friday
afternoon?

00:39:30.039 --> 00:39:31.019
Student:  Lab.
 

00:39:31.019 --> 00:39:31.920
Prof: Whoa!
 

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:32.480
Okay.
 

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:37.510
How many people cannot come
Saturday, early?

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:42.429
That's a lot.
 

00:39:42.429 --> 00:39:43.949
How many Saturday at 10:00?
 

00:39:43.949 --> 00:39:47.969
How many Saturday at 2:00?
 

00:39:47.969 --> 00:39:53.300
How many Sunday, 1:00 to 3:00?
 

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:56.489
Students:  Too early.
 

00:39:56.489 --> 00:39:59.110
Prof: Well bear in mind
that there's also the TA session

00:39:59.110 --> 00:39:59.829
Sunday evening.
 

00:39:59.829 --> 00:40:03.161
I think it's better if I do it
two days before the exam,

00:40:03.161 --> 00:40:04.920
rather than the day before.
 

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.748
But on the other hand,
none of these earlier times can

00:40:07.748 --> 00:40:10.309
get -- they're always at least
fifteen people.

00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:13.599
Well let me see about option
two.

00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:16.510
That was the one Thursday at
8:30.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:20.179
How about if it were 9:00?
 

00:40:20.179 --> 00:40:23.480
How many could not come if it
was at 9:00?

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.300
Student:  Wait,
which Thursday?

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.010
Prof: Thursday evening,
tomorrow evening.

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:30.733
That actually is -- and let's
see Sunday again,

00:40:30.733 --> 00:40:34.329
Sunday, sometime early
afternoon.

00:40:34.329 --> 00:40:37.614
There are actually more who
can't come on Sunday than

00:40:37.614 --> 00:40:38.309
Thursday.
 

00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:41.949
So I'm sorry,
but it'll be Thursday.

00:40:41.949 --> 00:40:43.639
It could be 8:30 or 9:00.
 

00:40:43.639 --> 00:40:45.030
Does it make a difference?
 

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:47.239
Is there somebody who'd come if
we started at 9:00?

00:40:47.239 --> 00:40:48.659
Student:  Is Saturday
one?

00:40:48.659 --> 00:40:49.570
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:50.510
Student:  Is Saturday
one?

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:51.480
Prof: Saturday what?
 

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:52.590
Student:  Is Saturday
bad?

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:54.780
Like how bad was that?
 

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:55.960
Prof: Saturday was
pretty bad.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:01.210
But let me see, Saturday 9:00?
 

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:01.980
Yes, that's worse.
 

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.579
Saturday 10:00?
 

00:41:04.579 --> 00:41:06.679
Saturday 2:00?
 

00:41:06.679 --> 00:41:10.199
Saturday 8:00 p.m.?
 

00:41:10.199 --> 00:41:12.559
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:41:12.559 --> 00:41:16.483
Prof: So it'll be
tomorrow night at 8:30,

00:41:16.483 --> 00:41:20.489
and I'll send you an email,
once I got a room.

00:41:20.489 --> 00:41:21.980
Okay, let's continue.
 

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:25.929
Okay, so to summarize the first
half of the semester.

00:41:25.929 --> 00:41:31.250
We've seen amazing modern tools
that show us molecules,

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:34.074
the real thing,
at the level of Ångstroms

00:41:34.074 --> 00:41:36.530
and at the time scale of
picoseconds,

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:38.369
10^-12 seconds.
 

00:41:38.369 --> 00:41:42.237
We've seen scanning probe
microscopy that can feel atoms,

00:41:42.237 --> 00:41:46.244
and X-ray diffraction that can
see them, and can see bonds,

00:41:46.244 --> 00:41:48.179
with difference density.
 

00:41:48.179 --> 00:41:51.268
We've seen spectroscopy,
IR and ESR.

00:41:51.268 --> 00:41:53.978
And next semester we'll talk
about nuclear magnetic

00:41:53.978 --> 00:41:54.630
resonance.
 

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:58.577
So there are amazing tools,
not only experimental tools,

00:41:58.577 --> 00:42:00.300
but theoretical tools.
 

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.639
This stuff about quantum
mechanics so that --

00:42:02.639 --> 00:42:06.717
and people believe quantum
mechanics enough that they talk

00:42:06.717 --> 00:42:09.579
about doing calculations on a
computer as

00:42:09.579 --> 00:42:13.443
"experiments,"
rather than just things you do

00:42:13.443 --> 00:42:14.659
in the lab.
 

00:42:14.659 --> 00:42:16.289
So that's amazing. Right?
 

00:42:16.289 --> 00:42:19.400
And it all has developed fairly
recently,

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.989
say since the time -- most of
the important things we've

00:42:23.989 --> 00:42:29.079
talked about have developed
since I was in graduate school.

00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:33.719
But what's amazing is that
organic chemists were not at all

00:42:33.719 --> 00:42:38.518
surprised when they were finally
able to see these things.

00:42:38.518 --> 00:42:43.340
Because they already knew what
they looked like.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.420
So it wasn't surprising.
 

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.760
It was satisfying.
 

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.898
And there were a few little
queer things that are understood

00:42:49.898 --> 00:42:52.186
better now than they were
before, certainly.

00:42:52.186 --> 00:42:52.719
Right?
 

00:42:52.719 --> 00:42:56.079
And things like being able to
generalize about what makes a

00:42:56.079 --> 00:42:58.340
functional group,
that's completely new.

00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:58.920
Right?
 

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:02.119
But fundamentally what
molecules look like and how

00:43:02.119 --> 00:43:04.927
atoms behave and that this
reacts with this,

00:43:04.927 --> 00:43:06.690
that was already known.
 

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:10.746
So how could they possibly know
it when they didn't have these

00:43:10.746 --> 00:43:11.280
tools?
 

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.574
And that's going to be our
chore for the next quarter of

00:43:14.574 --> 00:43:17.389
the semester,
is to figure out how they knew;

00:43:17.389 --> 00:43:19.329
how did organic chemistry
really develop?

00:43:19.329 --> 00:43:23.014
And a reason for this is that
if you know how it developed,

00:43:23.014 --> 00:43:26.000
then you understand the
language much better.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.659
Because the language we use
isn't the language of quantum

00:43:28.659 --> 00:43:29.610
mechanics usually.
 

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:32.983
It's the language that
developed during this long

00:43:32.983 --> 00:43:34.320
gestation period.
 

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.889
And it started,
as we said before,

00:43:35.889 --> 00:43:37.268
in the seventeenth century.
 

00:43:37.268 --> 00:43:40.184
And we've gone on this,
and we've talked now about

00:43:40.184 --> 00:43:43.563
science,
the scientific method and force

00:43:43.563 --> 00:43:45.867
laws,
and how we finally found out

00:43:45.867 --> 00:43:47.797
what the force law was for
atoms.

00:43:47.797 --> 00:43:48.340
Right?
 

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:52.639
And in the twentieth century,
this whole theoretical,

00:43:52.639 --> 00:43:55.635
experimental stuff came
together and we saw that bonds

00:43:55.635 --> 00:43:58.338
were shared electrons,
and we could see them,

00:43:58.338 --> 00:44:01.440
and that quantum mechanics
could help us to understand

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:01.909
them.
 

00:44:01.909 --> 00:44:04.289
But we've left out this middle
period,

00:44:04.289 --> 00:44:06.889
starting with the end of the
eighteenth century,

00:44:06.889 --> 00:44:09.909
with Lavoisier discovering
oxidation,

00:44:09.909 --> 00:44:12.500
and ending with the discovery
of quantum mechanics.

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:16.000
Because this is the period
during which most of organic

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.916
chemistry developed,
and we have to see how it

00:44:18.916 --> 00:44:19.760
happened.
 

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.139
Okay?
 

00:44:21.139 --> 00:44:26.913
So this, if you'd been here 107
years ago, and been graduating,

00:44:26.913 --> 00:44:32.034
you would've been in this
picture, with your fancy boots

00:44:32.034 --> 00:44:32.965
and so on.
 

00:44:32.965 --> 00:44:33.989
Right?
 

00:44:33.989 --> 00:44:35.820
This is the Computer Science
Building.

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:39.043
You walk up now -- it used to
be the Chemistry Lab,

00:44:39.043 --> 00:44:40.010
on the right.
 

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:41.610
You know where it is?
 

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:45.309
Watson Lab down there.
 

00:44:45.309 --> 00:44:45.989
Okay.
 

00:44:45.989 --> 00:44:48.445
So let's look at some,
see what they understood at the

00:44:48.445 --> 00:44:48.768
time.
 

00:44:48.768 --> 00:44:52.429
They chalked things on the
bricks, to show off their

00:44:52.429 --> 00:44:53.289
knowledge.
 

00:44:53.289 --> 00:44:57.619
So here's CH_4 methane;
obviously they knew that.

00:44:57.619 --> 00:45:00.043
And here's the reaction of
sulfuric acid with zinc,

00:45:00.043 --> 00:45:02.768
which gives hydrogen;
they knew that.

00:45:02.768 --> 00:45:06.719
And here, what do you think
that crazy thing is in the

00:45:06.719 --> 00:45:07.389
middle?
 

00:45:07.389 --> 00:45:08.539
Student:  A benzene ring.
 

00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:09.619
Prof: That's a benzene
ring.

00:45:09.619 --> 00:45:12.418
And remember how it looks like
what they confirmed at about the

00:45:12.418 --> 00:45:12.960
same time?
 

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:18.009
The clairvoyant people saw that
the valences all went to the

00:45:18.009 --> 00:45:18.780
center.
 

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:19.750
Okay?
 

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:21.329
And down here you see another
thing.

00:45:21.329 --> 00:45:25.134
Those are probably aromatic
rings, with the double bonds not

00:45:25.134 --> 00:45:25.650
shown.
 

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:27.797
But an interesting thing that's
shown, the Greek letters,

00:45:27.797 --> 00:45:29.369
Î± and
Î² there.

00:45:29.369 --> 00:45:32.891
Those are symbols that are
still used to denote different

00:45:32.891 --> 00:45:36.289
positions that you can put
substituents in the ring.

00:45:36.289 --> 00:45:41.132
Okay, this is inside the
Chemistry Lab,

00:45:41.132 --> 00:45:44.829
which was where SSS is now.
 

00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:51.650
And you see things like this,
right?

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:53.960
Which came from that lab I'm
sure.

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.197
There was a big box of them
floating around here,

00:45:56.197 --> 00:45:58.250
and I rescued one of them a
long time ago.

00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:59.860
The others got thrown out.
 

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.679
There.
 

00:46:01.679 --> 00:46:04.679
And what's that second arrow?
 

00:46:04.679 --> 00:46:06.110
There's another important tool.
 

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:07.000
Student:  Bunsen burner.
 

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.286
Prof: The Bunsen burner.
 

00:46:10.286 --> 00:46:11.030
Right?
 

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:15.469
Bunsen invented the burner
about 1860, or something like

00:46:15.469 --> 00:46:16.679
that, or '70.
 

00:46:16.679 --> 00:46:21.432
Okay, here, there's one that
looks just like this,

00:46:21.432 --> 00:46:22.210
right?
 

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:26.197
Actually, this isn't that old,
because it says on it

00:46:26.197 --> 00:46:28.309
"West Germany".
 

00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:33.869
&gt;
 

00:46:33.869 --> 00:46:36.204
Prof: Okay,
there, what do we see here,

00:46:36.204 --> 00:46:37.139
the white thing?
 

00:46:37.139 --> 00:46:37.949
Student:  Mortar and
pestle.

00:46:37.949 --> 00:46:40.405
Prof: Mortar and pestle;
they could grind things up.

00:46:40.405 --> 00:46:40.739
Right?
 

00:46:40.739 --> 00:46:42.460
And there, what's that?
 

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:43.679
Student:  It's a burette.
 

00:46:43.679 --> 00:46:45.300
Prof: It's a burette
drying upside down.

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:53.940
Notice, that's the only
quantitative tool.

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:59.228
So were there any other
quantitative tools in this

00:46:59.228 --> 00:47:03.329
picture, that they were showing
off?

00:47:03.329 --> 00:47:04.510
Student: Well there's
somebody who has it on the side.

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:06.250
Prof: Ah ha,
there were burettes.

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:08.460
Anything else that will give
you a number?

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.090
Student:  A scale.
 

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:11.340
Student:  There's a
scale.

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:20.199
Students:  Oh.
 

00:47:20.199 --> 00:47:21.518
Prof: But that's just a
crude balance,

00:47:21.518 --> 00:47:21.760
right?
 

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.793
There had analytical balances,
but they weren't portable,

00:47:24.793 --> 00:47:27.396
they couldn't schlep them out
to Prospect Street,

00:47:27.396 --> 00:47:28.480
for the picture.
 

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:31.480
Okay, but that was it.
 

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:32.630
Okay?
 

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:36.079
This guy here.
 

00:47:36.079 --> 00:47:38.550
&gt;
 

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:41.809
Looked like that;
C. Mahlon Kline, Class of 1901S.

00:47:41.809 --> 00:47:47.510
And you know his name because
GlaxoSmithKline.

00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:50.641
And he gave money for the Kline
Biology Tower,

00:47:50.641 --> 00:47:56.969
and the Kline Chemistry Lab;
and the Kline Geology Lab too.

00:47:56.969 --> 00:48:00.331
But you could also measure
angles on crystals.

00:48:00.331 --> 00:48:00.929
Right?
 

00:48:00.929 --> 00:48:02.159
But that's about it.
 

00:48:02.159 --> 00:48:06.487
Somehow, with these tools,
they figured out where atoms

00:48:06.487 --> 00:48:08.170
were, in molecules.
 

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:11.090
Isn't that crazy?
 

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:12.349
So if you look at the front of
the building,

00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:16.351
you see down here -- he's
wrapped in stuff now because

00:48:16.351 --> 00:48:19.744
they're painting him --
Benjamin Silliman,

00:48:19.744 --> 00:48:24.119
Yale's first scientist;
first chemist anyhow.

00:48:24.119 --> 00:48:25.309
And he's holding something.
 

00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:26.650
Can you see what he's holding?
 

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:31.179
Student:  A crystal.
 

00:48:31.179 --> 00:48:33.224
Prof: A big,
whopping crystal.

00:48:33.224 --> 00:48:33.679
Right?
 

00:48:33.679 --> 00:48:35.050
That's where science was at.
 

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:39.510
That's what he's mostly known
for, is mineralogical things.

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:40.110
Okay.
 

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:42.909
But here, on these plaques,
is something else.

00:48:42.909 --> 00:48:46.371
This is the names of the people
who actually developed all this

00:48:46.371 --> 00:48:48.550
stuff, during the nineteenth
century.

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:51.780
So it starts in the seventeenth
century, actually,

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:53.760
with Boyle and the gas laws.
 

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:57.800
But that was way before --
notice, he was born 120 years

00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:01.400
before the time we're talking
about, Lavoisier.

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.273
So things happened,
but not a lot,

00:49:03.273 --> 00:49:05.489
for our purposes,
during that period.

00:49:05.489 --> 00:49:08.239
And it really got underway with
the second person.

00:49:08.239 --> 00:49:11.018
These are in chronological
order.

00:49:11.018 --> 00:49:13.498
The second one was Lavoisier,
and that's where we're going to

00:49:13.498 --> 00:49:13.829
start.
 

00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:16.469
And then Gay-Lussac,
Berzelius, Faraday.

00:49:16.469 --> 00:49:18.280
We're going to talk about these
people.

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:18.768
Okay?
 

00:49:18.768 --> 00:49:22.070
And here is you,
and your cousins,

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:24.570
who did all this stuff.
 

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:27.090
Because we have a family tree
here.

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:31.389
So there's you, and me.
 

00:49:31.389 --> 00:49:35.032
And I studied quantum mechanics
as a graduate student with

00:49:35.032 --> 00:49:36.630
E.B. Wilson -- right?
 

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:40.257
-- who was a post-doc with
Linus Pauling at Caltech,

00:49:40.257 --> 00:49:42.320
who did X-ray and proteins.
 

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:46.070
He's the first guy that saw the
helices of the proteins.

00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:46.739
Okay?
 

00:49:46.739 --> 00:49:49.360
And another post-doc of Pauling
was Jack Dunitz,

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.090
who we've talked about a lot.
 

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:53.802
So Dunitz, who we've talked
about a lot, is your

00:49:53.802 --> 00:49:55.420
great-uncle, academically.
 

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:58.480
&gt;
 

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:01.018
But if we go back -- oh,
and here are things -- notice

00:50:01.018 --> 00:50:03.557
how many of these things,
the twentieth century things

00:50:03.557 --> 00:50:04.659
we've talked about.
 

00:50:04.659 --> 00:50:10.045
Notice that boldface is things
that are experimental,

00:50:10.045 --> 00:50:14.190
and normal face is theoretical
things.

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:17.489
Shared-pair bonds,
mesomerism, which is resonance.

00:50:17.489 --> 00:50:20.929
Electron pair shifts,
the curved arrows.

00:50:20.929 --> 00:50:22.119
Quantum Theory.
 

00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:25.347
Reaction mechanisms;
we already talked about ammonia

00:50:25.347 --> 00:50:28.239
being oxidized by chlorine,
for example.

00:50:28.239 --> 00:50:29.650
IR spectroscopy we talked about.
 

00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:31.653
We haven't talked about -- well
we've talked a little about

00:50:31.653 --> 00:50:32.380
polymers, not much.
 

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:34.239
We haven't done mass
spectroscopy.

00:50:34.239 --> 00:50:37.119
Well we did actually the
problem set in the first thing,

00:50:37.119 --> 00:50:37.539
right?
 

00:50:37.539 --> 00:50:40.030
Conformational analysis we'll
do at the end of the semester.

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:41.190
X-ray we've talked about.
 

00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:42.739
NMR, next semester.
 

00:50:42.739 --> 00:50:44.719
Molecular orbital methods,
we've talked about a lot.

00:50:44.719 --> 00:50:46.400
This is what we've been talking
about.

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.860
That we'll do at the end of the
semester.

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:50.739
Non-covalent structures we just
talked about a little bit.

00:50:50.739 --> 00:50:53.539
Scanning probe microscopy is
quite recent,

00:50:53.539 --> 00:50:54.360
and so on.
 

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:57.061
So we've actually talked about
a lot of this stuff already,

00:50:57.061 --> 00:50:58.179
the more recent stuff.
 

00:50:58.179 --> 00:51:01.420
But what we want to talk about
now is the earlier stuff,

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:04.780
how people discovered things in
the nineteenth century.

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:07.369
So these are the guys that did
it.

00:51:07.369 --> 00:51:10.619
And in particular we're
starting with Lavoisier.

00:51:10.619 --> 00:51:16.130
But Lavoisier was not the first
altogether.

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:19.436
But I'm going to have to wait
'til next time to tell you who

00:51:19.436 --> 00:51:20.110
was first.

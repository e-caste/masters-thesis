00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.500
I'm going to start
playing a song.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.700
This lecture is taking us from
the end of Reconstruction,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.800
1877, canvassing an array of
events that actually go up

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.667
to the, well to the
present day in certain ways,

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:26.667
but in a recorded
way, in an official way,

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:29.500
until the 1960s.&nbsp;
But we will--so from a

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.500
phenomenological standpoint,
we're talking about a large

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.467
period of time.&nbsp; From
a literal standpoint,

00:00:35.467 --> 00:00:37.300
for this lecture, we're
really talking about the

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.500
18--end of Reconstruction
to the end of the nineteenth

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.467
century.&nbsp; And with that, I
want--I want to play a piece

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:47.000
of music that's actually
from the era of the Great

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.700
Depression, but it's in
reference to the time period

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.300
we're talking about right
now.&nbsp; And if I can figure it

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.600
out while you're
listening to it,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.500
I'll get the lyrics up
on the screen as well.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.367
[Billie Holiday]&nbsp; ♪And now
I'd like to sing a tune.&nbsp;♪

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:02.400
♪ It was written
especially for me.&nbsp; ♪

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.900
♪ It's titled Strange Fruit.
I really hope you like it. ♪

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:27.600

♪ Here is a strange

00:03:50.567 --> 00:03:52.400
Many of you, some of
you, I don't know,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.800
might recognize this as
one of Billie Holiday's,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.867
the great blues
singer, one of her,

00:03:56.867 --> 00:04:01.500
her most famous pieces,
wrote by--not by her,

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.500
but becomes one of her
signature pieces for much of

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.900
her career, Strange Fruit.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.900
Well, I don't think it needs
elaboration in terms of

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.000
interpretative potential of
those lyrics.&nbsp; It's a song

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
about lynching,
and violence,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and the
Southern nature of it,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.967
the scent of
magnolia trees and such.

00:04:24.967 --> 00:04:29.400
Now you'll recall from the
last lecture how I talked

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.700
about the massive cultural
shift that Southerners had

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.800
to endure under
Reconstruction governments.&nbsp;

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.867
White Southerners'
very notions of freedom,

00:04:41.867 --> 00:04:45.300
the very notions of
labor, who's to do the work,

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.467
and of politics, who's
running their states,

00:04:49.467 --> 00:04:51.700
all these were turned upside
down in the most fundamental

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.067
ways.&nbsp; You'll
remember as well,

00:04:58.967 --> 00:05:02.600
at--nearing, nearing
the end of the 1870s,

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.200
the North is exhausted by
Southern intransigence.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.100
South is digging--is
continuing digging--to keep

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.767
its heels dug in, and
a deal is brokered,

00:05:12.767 --> 00:05:16.500
and a presidential dispute,
a presidential election,

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.800
that essentially
withdraws Northern troops,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.867
Federal troops,
from the South,

00:05:20.867 --> 00:05:23.900
ends Reconstruction,
and then gives the chance

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.700
to--for the South to
reorganize itself fully

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.367
within the Union.&nbsp;
Historians refer to this

00:05:30.367 --> 00:05:33.567
moment, this era that
begins at that moment,

00:05:33.567 --> 00:05:36.200
as "the Rise of
Redemption."&nbsp; So you have

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.567
Reconstruction
followed by Redemption.&nbsp; Now

00:05:39.567 --> 00:05:44.000
Redemption...this is a word
that needs to be understood,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.300
understood as a fully
complicated and loaded

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.100
phrase.&nbsp; Who's
feeling redeemed,

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:55.100
and redeemed on what terms?&nbsp;
It's really important to

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.567
understand that when I'm
talking about Redemption,

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.300
when most people
talk about Redemption,

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.300
they're talking about the
white South rising up and

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.100
taking control of what was
rightfully theirs.&nbsp; We're

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.600
talking about the
while male South as well,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.567
and we're talking in
different ways about the

00:06:13.567 --> 00:06:15.500
wealthy South and
the poor South,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.700
the white poor
South, and I'll,

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.300
I'll map this out in the
course of today's lecture.&nbsp;

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.000
We are not talking about
at all a constructive or

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
positive era as far as the
African American experience

00:06:32.067 --> 00:06:35.300
is concerned.&nbsp; Now
during Reconstruction,

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.900
as I hope I made clear
in previous lectures,

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.200
deep seated anxieties take
root among Southern whites

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.167
about economics,
about states' rights,

00:06:45.167 --> 00:06:47.900
and this is a very important
couple of words here for

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.400
today's lecture and for this
week's reading as well.&nbsp;

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.900
There's anxiety about
economics and states'

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.467
rights, but also about
manliness and civilization.&nbsp;

00:06:57.467 --> 00:07:04.667
Manliness and civilization,
really critical words.&nbsp; So

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:08.700
much of
Redemption, this era,

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.867
is about reclaiming--about
whites trying to reclaim

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.900
that which they thought was
lost during Reconstruction

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.200
and that which they thought
was under attack.&nbsp; A perfect

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.067
example of an attempt
by, or an articulation by,

00:07:28.067 --> 00:07:32.867
Southern whites about how
they are going to redeem

00:07:32.867 --> 00:07:36.200
themselves--redeem the
South--from the scourge of

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.000
the Northern presence, is
the fact that as soon as the

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.900
federal troops
leave, essentially,

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:48.300
the KKK, which had been
wiped out by the military,

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.900
Northern troops, soon
after it was established,

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:56.000
the KKK reemerges with a
vengeance.&nbsp; But it's not the

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.067
only group being formed in
this moment of Redemption.&nbsp;

00:07:59.067 --> 00:08:02.567
There are other groups.&nbsp; You
don't need to know the names

00:08:02.567 --> 00:08:04.600
for your--for the
purposes of the class,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.700
but just know there
were other organizations,

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.700
like the Knights of
the White Camelia,

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.600
the
Constitutional Union Guards,

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.967
the Pale Faces, the
White Brotherhood,

00:08:12.967 --> 00:08:16.900
and the Council of Safety.&nbsp;
The last name is kind of

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.900
interesting, because it's
not one of these sort of

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.000
grandiose,
mythical kind of names,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.567
not Council of Safety.&nbsp;
Who's feeling threatened?&nbsp;

00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:31.567
Under what terms?&nbsp; How will
we establish safety?&nbsp; So any

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:41.000
number of nativist and
racist hate groups that are

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.800
being formed in this
moment of cultural anxiety,

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.000
I guess is the most
polite way to put it,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.300
cultural, economic, social
anxiety in the white South

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.967
and a determination to
reclaim it on its own

00:08:51.967 --> 00:08:57.967
terms.&nbsp; Now when Republican
government's faded,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.567
once the
federal troops left,

00:09:03.567 --> 00:09:05.800
when they faded in the wake
of a resurgent Democratic

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.667
party, which is a
Southern party,

00:09:07.667 --> 00:09:11.400
this at the end
of Reconstruction,

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.867
a range of tactics start
being developed to guarantee

00:09:15.867 --> 00:09:18.167
the return of white power.&nbsp;
So it's not just that the

00:09:18.167 --> 00:09:21.200
federal troops left, the
government's collapsed,

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.967
whites were all of a sudden
in control.&nbsp; It wasn't that

00:09:22.967 --> 00:09:25.800
quick and that easy.&nbsp; It was
actually dirty and messy.&nbsp;

00:09:29.167 --> 00:09:33.800
Crops that were owned
and tilled by blacks were

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:39.800
destroyed.&nbsp; Blacks' homes,
their barns--which is an

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.100
incredibly important part
of the infrastructure in the

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.000
South--their homes, their
barns and other property

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.067
were destroyed, were burned,
as well.&nbsp; If blacks tried to

00:09:51.067 --> 00:09:54.300
exercise the right
to vote, black men,

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.700
and go to the
election booth,

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.400
and if it is deemed by
someone--how is really

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.900
immaterial--but deemed
that they might be voting

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.100
Republican, which virtually
all blacks were going to do

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.600
anyway, you might find when
you walked up to a voting

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.467
booth--I might find if I
were walking to the voting

00:10:10.467 --> 00:10:14.100
booth, someone standing
outside brandishing a whip,

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.000
making it very clear that if
I voted for anybody but the

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.700
Democrat, the whip would be
used.&nbsp; So there is sort of a

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:28.300
scorched earth
policy by citizens,

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.300
white citizens of the South
to reclaim what was theirs,

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:35.167
to get blacks off the land,
to destroy their property.&nbsp;

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:38.867
And the people doing this
dirty work are quite often

00:10:38.867 --> 00:10:44.367
members of these local
militias like the Klan.&nbsp; Now

00:10:44.367 --> 00:10:48.500
the Klan's
[coughs], excuse me,

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.400
the Klan's
census, its numbers,

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.600
really hard to peg down
at any particular moment,

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.900
and its popularity ebbs and
flows.&nbsp; We're at a moment,

00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.000
it's just come back, it's
been destroyed for close to

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.300
a decade.&nbsp; It's coming back,
it will be around for a

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.000
while, it will
fade out for a while,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.167
and we'll see in a couple of
weeks how it comes back very

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:11.000
strongly again.&nbsp; But it is
sort of always there at some

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.300
level as a manifestation of
cultural and psychological

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:22.767
anxiety.&nbsp; Now remember
during Reconstruction,

00:11:22.767 --> 00:11:29.300
blacks had a tremendous new
amount of voting power.&nbsp; I

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.400
mean they weren't
winning all elected offices,

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:36.867
of course, but as they had
no representation prior to

00:11:36.867 --> 00:11:41.500
Reconstruction, any change
was a welcome change.&nbsp; When

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.000
Redemption begins, black
voting power is diluted very

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.300
quickly through a range of
tactics.&nbsp; You certainly have

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.900
people at the polling
station with whips.&nbsp; That's

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.900
a pretty effective way to
stop a black person from

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.200
voting, but you also
have gerrymandering,

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:03.967
the reconfiguration
of voting districts to

00:12:03.967 --> 00:12:07.000
eliminate or to
mitigate the black vote.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.767
Since housing
segregation was,

00:12:08.767 --> 00:12:11.767
was the rule of the land,
if you cut a district in a

00:12:11.767 --> 00:12:14.467
certain way, you can make
sure that you cut out black

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:17.500
voting numbers to make
any real change.&nbsp; So

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.267
gerrymandering--which
is part of,

00:12:19.267 --> 00:12:21.500
you know, a long tradition.&nbsp;
It's not just a Southern

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.400
one, not just against
blacks.&nbsp; Gerrymandering is

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.800
used.&nbsp; Poll taxes are
developed.&nbsp; Essentially you

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.367
need to come to the
poll, the registrar,

00:12:30.367 --> 00:12:34.067
to prove that you had paid
taxes on land that you own

00:12:34.067 --> 00:12:35.200
according to
certain guidelines,

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.567
you know, generation
or whatever.&nbsp; Well,

00:12:37.567 --> 00:12:39.900
blacks didn't own land,
and if it's about their

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.400
predecessors, their
predecessors didn't own

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.900
land.&nbsp; Or, if
they had owned land,

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.600
or if it's just
about maybe just paying,

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.500
proof of paying taxes, they
didn't have the money to pay

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:56.500
it.&nbsp; Very effective ways
to mitigate the black vote

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.100
during this era are
grandfather clauses.&nbsp; It's

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.600
very simple: if your
grandfather voted,

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.600
you can vote.&nbsp; Well,
basically no blacks'

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.600
grandfathers had voted.&nbsp;
Wipes out the black voting

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.600
population.&nbsp; And
then famously,

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.100
of course, literacy tests.&nbsp;
They're adjudicated by a

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.567
registrar under the
most sort of random--well,

00:13:18.567 --> 00:13:23.867
they weren't random at all,
but subjective--that's what

00:13:23.867 --> 00:13:24.867
I was looking
for--subjective

00:13:24.867 --> 00:13:31.067
circumstances.&nbsp; So if you
could read this section of a

00:13:31.067 --> 00:13:33.800
state constitution, or if
you could recite it from

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.900
memory, or if you could do
anything that suggested you

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.100
were literate, then
you could vote.&nbsp; Well,

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:44.000
although one of the great
stories in world history of

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.500
literacy gain
happens during,

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.100
begins during this era, in
terms of blacks becoming a

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.900
literate population
within the course of two

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.700
generations--hadn't
ever happened before--they

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.367
weren't literate yet as a
group.&nbsp; So literacy tests

00:13:57.367 --> 00:13:59.600
would wipe it out.&nbsp; So
you take gerrymandering,

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.600
you take poll taxes,
grandfather clauses,

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.600
literacy tests, and
literal violence,

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.067
or threat of violence,
you're wiping out the black

00:14:07.067 --> 00:14:10.800
vote.&nbsp; Now it's
important to realize,

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.000
you're also wiping out a
lot of the poor white vote.&nbsp;

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.500
This is an unintended--well,
it depends on your

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.767
interpretation--unintended
or intended consequence of

00:14:19.767 --> 00:14:25.300
those who held the reins of
power in the white South.&nbsp;

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.800
What was certainly
unintended--bless you--is

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:33.367
that poor whites, and
there were a lot of them,

00:14:33.367 --> 00:14:36.800
and blacks, who were almost,
almost by default poor

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.700
during this era--we're
talking into the 18--going

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.367
into the 1880s--start
realizing they actually had

00:14:42.367 --> 00:14:46.000
a lot in common.&nbsp; They were
all hungry.&nbsp; They were all

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.367
essentially landless.

00:14:48.367 --> 00:14:50.200
And that the
white poor farmer,

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.267
the poor white farmer had
more in common with the poor

00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:55.867
black farmer than did the
white poor farmer did with

00:14:55.867 --> 00:15:01.500
the white gentry, the
political elite.&nbsp; And you

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.467
have, going into the
turn of the century,

00:15:03.467 --> 00:15:07.400
into the twentieth century,
the rise of one of the many

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.000
different articulations
of the Populist Party,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.900
rise of populism.&nbsp; Now the
history of populism is much

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.800
more complicated than the
one minute I'm going to give

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:20.800
it right now.&nbsp; But you have,
during the end of the 19th

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.500
century, a range of
different attempts to try to

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:31.200
gather some power for poor
agrarian classes.&nbsp; And in

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.867
some places in the South,
a curious thing starts

00:15:32.867 --> 00:15:36.000
happening, that white and
black farmers start aligning

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.200
themselves with each
other, start running

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.600
campaigns--joint tickets,
start fighting for the same

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:46.900
candidate.&nbsp; Tom Watson,
a famous politician from

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:50.100
Georgia, actually
rises to power,

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.000
rises to a
level of influence,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.400
on this notion of, you
know, working for agrarian

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.167
interests.&nbsp; But a
funny thing happens,

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:02.000
is that it becomes--it
starts becoming successful,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.700
and there's a realization
by the political elite: "My

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.800
god, if these poor whites
and poor blacks start really

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.500
working together,
we're in trouble,

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.600
&nbsp; 'cause the system is
not just about racial

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.600
domination, but it's also
about economic domination.&nbsp;

00:16:17.867 --> 00:16:22.300
As a result of the rise
in popularity of Populist

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:28.167
sentiment, the race card
gets played with increasing

00:16:28.167 --> 00:16:30.200
ferocity.&nbsp; Rhetoric, like
you saw in the 1868 campaign

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:37.700
poster from a
couple of lectures ago,

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.967
that this is a
white man's country,

00:16:38.967 --> 00:16:44.667
becomes much more
commonplace.&nbsp;&nbsp; That we may

00:16:44.667 --> 00:16:47.600
have different incomes, we
may have different sort of

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.900
economic
security, but by God,

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.300
we're all white, and there's
prestige and value in it.&nbsp;

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.500
And when you have a set of
rules or--not rules--a set

00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:02.700
of social order being
bestowed upon the South by

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.300
the Klan, that's
preying upon racial anxiety,

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.767
as well as going
against Catholics and Jews,

00:17:09.767 --> 00:17:13.167
but preying on
racial anxiety,

00:17:13.167 --> 00:17:15.600
you start seeing fissures in
the Populist sentiment just

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.000
as quickly as they
appeared.&nbsp; And Tom Watson

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.267
being someone who sort of
gathered up the energy of a

00:17:20.267 --> 00:17:27.167
cross-racial alliance
quickly becomes a hardcore

00:17:27.167 --> 00:17:30.067
racist and anti-Semite, so
this is a radical shift for

00:17:30.067 --> 00:17:31.067
him.

00:17:31.067 --> 00:17:34.700
But there's this
potential unifying moment,

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.800
based on class lines,
evaporates in the face of

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:45.300
racial demagoguery.&nbsp; That's
what this era's about more

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.267
than anything else.&nbsp;
All these other factors

00:17:48.267 --> 00:17:51.200
certainly are around that
helps define who America is,

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.067
you know, class differences,
differences about

00:17:54.067 --> 00:17:57.067
possibilities related to
your gender.&nbsp; But race is

00:17:57.067 --> 00:17:59.800
the driving factor for so
many issues relating to

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.300
quality of life and safety.&nbsp;
Now getting back to the

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:08.467
vote, for example, blacks
were voting in new and

00:18:08.467 --> 00:18:10.300
startling numbers during
Reconstruction.&nbsp; Blacks were

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.400
holding office from the
local to the federal level,

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:19.800
but because of a series
of different mechanisms I

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:25.167
talked about, because the
rise of playing to racial

00:18:25.167 --> 00:18:27.800
anxieties becomes
much more effective,

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.500
the black vote's wiped
out.&nbsp; So just a couple of

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.800
statistics, just
to keep, you know,

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:38.300
as representative.&nbsp; In
1896, we're talking in,

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.000
in Louisiana,
just as one example,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.467
over one hundred and
thirty thousand blacks are

00:18:44.467 --> 00:18:48.000
registered to
vote in Louisiana,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.900
and they are the majority
in twenty-six parishes.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.200
&nbsp;Black voting
representation.&nbsp; Four years

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.700
later, in just four years,
going from over one hundred

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.667
and thirty thousand
blacks, four years later,

00:19:01.667 --> 00:19:03.000
there are fifty-three
hundred blacks on the

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.667
polls--on the voting rolls,
and there are no majority

00:19:06.667 --> 00:19:10.867
black parishes anywhere.&nbsp;
That is an elimination of a

00:19:10.867 --> 00:19:16.600
voting class, overnight.&nbsp;
In one election cycle,

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.167
or maybe two if it's a
two-year election cycle,

00:19:19.167 --> 00:19:22.700
you go from a possibility of
black representation to zero

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:29.300
possibility.&nbsp; In Alabama,
of one hundred and eighty

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:33.700
thousand black men of
voting age in 1900,

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.100
in the wake of all these
different kinds of ways of

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:41.200
eliminating the
black vote, in 1900,

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.367
of over one hundred and
eighty thousand possible

00:19:43.367 --> 00:19:45.400
black men who'd be
eligible voters,

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.400
only three thousand are
registered to vote.&nbsp; Now if

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.467
you know
anything about Alabama,

00:19:49.467 --> 00:19:52.400
you'll know there is a
large black population in

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:56.900
Alabama.&nbsp; There're real
opportunities to have black

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.700
voting representation if
people actually had access

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.900
to the ballot box.&nbsp; There's
no access.&nbsp; Three thousand

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.067
people--three thousand men
are registered to vote.&nbsp;

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.500
Registering to vote,
you need to understand,

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.600
is not a matter of
filling out a card and just

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.367
disinterestedly
putting it in the mailbox,

00:20:14.367 --> 00:20:16.767
something like that.&nbsp;
No, registering to vote,

00:20:16.767 --> 00:20:20.100
if you're a black man, is
a matter of life or death,

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.900
in certain--in many of these
places.&nbsp; The possibility of

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.700
having your
home burned down,

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.367
of getting
whipped, getting beaten,

00:20:29.367 --> 00:20:31.800
and, as we'll
see, getting shot,

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:37.400
is very real.&nbsp; Now when
it comes to the vote,

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.400
you have all these forces
trying to wipe it out,

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.067
but it's important to take a
moment to try to understand

00:20:46.067 --> 00:20:48.200
the psychology about why
it's so important to wipe it

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:55.400
out.&nbsp; We can take a--an
example from a famous

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.400
politician, J.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.400
K.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.900
Vardaman of Mississippi.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:05.200
Rabid racist.&nbsp; And his
view of blacks' ability and

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.667
education related to
their--how civilized they

00:21:10.667 --> 00:21:11.967
were--again,
there's that word.

00:21:11.967 --> 00:21:15.400
I'll start unpacking it
later on in the lecture.&nbsp;

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.000
That they did not
have--they were,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.467
they were
uncivilized, uncivilized,

00:21:18.467 --> 00:21:20.300
they were not
educated enough,

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:24.300
they didn't have the ability
to be responsible voters.&nbsp;

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.600
And Vardaman says, another
one of these rather lovely

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.267
sentiments, "I am just as
opposed to Booker Washington

00:21:31.267 --> 00:21:35.100
as a voter, with all his
Anglo-Saxon reinforcements,

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.900
as I am to the
coconut-headed,

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.900
chocolate-colored typical
little coon who blacks my

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.567
shoes every morning.&nbsp;
Neither is fit to perform

00:21:43.567 --> 00:21:45.567
the supreme
function of citizenship."

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:48.700
Booker T.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.300
Washington, who we'll be
talking about next week.&nbsp; By

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.400
the late nineteenth century,
the leader of the race;

00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:00.400
there's no disputing
that fact.&nbsp; Even he,

00:22:03.967 --> 00:22:06.400
the most powerful black
person in the country,

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:12.000
according to Vardaman, does
not possess the ability to

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000
be a responsible voter.&nbsp;
Now when all this kinds

00:22:20.667 --> 00:22:23.800
of--these kinds of
harassments fail,

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.500
if they weren't
successful, if they,

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.300
if they--if Vardaman
couldn't whip up enough

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.867
sentiment among
the registrars to,

00:22:30.867 --> 00:22:32.900
like, just find ways to
eliminate the black vote.&nbsp;

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.367
If you had somebody who
could pass the literacy

00:22:35.367 --> 00:22:37.600
test, who
somehow could pass,

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.500
you know, pay a poll tax,
who could pass the bar as

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.500
established by the registrar
to prevent him from voting,

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:49.900
there was always the
ultimate form of what one

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.100
could only politely
call racial harassment,

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:58.100
and that's lynching.&nbsp; The
statistics on lynching are

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:07.900
sketchy at best.&nbsp; Historians
generally point to the early

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.667
1880s as the first moment
when reliable records of

00:23:10.667 --> 00:23:15.500
lynchings first appear.&nbsp; Now
it's important to recognize

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:19.900
the timing.&nbsp; I made a
comment in a previous

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:25.500
lecture about the value of a
black body.&nbsp; Lynching is not

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.667
a phenomenon you
see during an era,

00:23:27.667 --> 00:23:30.600
during--prior to
the Civil War.&nbsp; Yeah,

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:35.667
there's always a
sample here and there,

00:23:35.667 --> 00:23:41.200
but as a phenomenon, it's
not there when it comes to

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.400
slaves, because if
you lynched a slave,

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.900
you lynched
somebody's property.&nbsp; You

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:50.600
destroyed--you owed them a
lot of money.&nbsp; In its own

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.167
grotesque way,
slavery afforded a level of

00:23:53.167 --> 00:23:55.300
protection for blacks.&nbsp; It
certainly wasn't there after

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.600
emancipation.&nbsp; Of course,
that is not a defense of

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.600
slavery, but that is just
sort of an economic element

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:06.167
to consider in this
equation.&nbsp; During the period

00:24:06.167 --> 00:24:08.767
of federal
occupation of the South,

00:24:08.767 --> 00:24:14.267
there was enough military
presence to mitigate

00:24:14.267 --> 00:24:20.100
these--this form of
violence.&nbsp; But when the

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.667
North is gone, when the
federal troops are gone,

00:24:22.667 --> 00:24:24.300
during the era
of Redemption,

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.900
this is how--one of the ways
the South redeems itself.&nbsp;

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:35.067
So reliable records about
lynching really point to the

00:24:35.067 --> 00:24:37.067
early 1880s.&nbsp; There were
certain lynchings before

00:24:37.067 --> 00:24:39.900
then, but consistently, we
have records pointing to the

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:44.367
1880s.&nbsp; So
between 1882 and 1901,

00:24:44.367 --> 00:24:49.000
you have recorded more than
a hundred lynchings a year

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.367
throughout the nation.&nbsp;
Between 1882 and 1968,

00:24:55.367 --> 00:24:58.800
when, quote "traditional"
forms of lynching

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.800
essentially
disappeared--although they

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.000
are not gone from us,
don't kid yourself about

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.767
that--over four thou--excuse
me over five thousand people

00:25:09.767 --> 00:25:17.200
died in recorded lynchings.&nbsp;
Easily three quarters of

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.200
them or more were African
American.&nbsp; Lynching was not

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.300
only--Blacks were not the
only victims of lynchings.&nbsp;

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.700
Overwhelmingly, they were
the victims of lynchings.&nbsp;

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.000
But the most important thing
to know about these numbers

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.600
is that these represent
recorded lynchings.&nbsp;

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.467
Historians presume quite
safely that numbers were

00:25:37.467 --> 00:25:44.667
much higher.&nbsp; Now lynchings
were not just about

00:25:44.667 --> 00:25:48.400
stringing somebody up.&nbsp;
There were many different

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:55.100
types of lynchings, and this
is why it's easy for us to

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.400
presume that
there are, you know,

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.400
ones that are very
public and recorded,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.800
and those that just happened
very quietly.&nbsp; No one really

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:09.067
knows about it.&nbsp; So you
have the most obvious,

00:26:09.067 --> 00:26:11.800
straightforward form of this
kind of violence.&nbsp; Someone

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.667
is captured,
they're strung up,

00:26:14.667 --> 00:26:18.500
and either a chair kicked
out from underneath of them,

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.500
a horse run off, whatever.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:27.367
They die by strangulation,
by hanging.&nbsp; But you also

00:26:27.367 --> 00:26:31.900
have lynchings, it
wasn't the majority of them,

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.700
but they were certainly
important to understand the

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.167
phenomenon of
lynching, festival

00:26:37.167 --> 00:26:42.700
lynches--lynchings.&nbsp; You
would have lynchings that

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.700
are advertised in
the local paper,

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.000
in advance, you know
that on Saturday night,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000
we're lynching Joe Smith in
Natchez.&nbsp; Enough time for

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.667
rail companies to
sell excursion tickets,

00:27:02.667 --> 00:27:08.800
advertised in the papers, so
you could have a grotesque

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.500
festival around this--this
actual moment of murder.&nbsp;

00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:18.967
Lynchings may not have just
been--weren't just getting

00:27:18.967 --> 00:27:25.100
strung up, but it could be,
involve being nailed to a

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:31.100
post or a tree and being lit
on fire.&nbsp; It might involve

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.200
being physically--in
fact, often involved being

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.667
physically assaulted and
mutilated while you're

00:27:43.667 --> 00:27:47.500
conscious, before you're
strung up to a post to be

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.800
burned, or before you're
actually strung up by a

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:56.900
tree.&nbsp; When the
lynching was over,

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.500
especially for the
festival lynchings,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.567
the abuse to the body
wouldn't end.&nbsp; The body

00:28:08.567 --> 00:28:10.000
might be chopped down.&nbsp;
As you remember from,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.300
in my second lecture, the
young Irish butcher dragging

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:18.100
a black victim through the
streets of New York by his

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.467
genitals, as a way of
sort of declaring his

00:28:20.467 --> 00:28:23.400
citizenship, I
was arguing.&nbsp; Well,

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:28.400
body parts were chopped off
after lynchings: fingers,

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:33.600
toes, genitals, ears are
cut off.&nbsp; They are kept as

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:39.300
souvenirs, and they are
sold as souvenirs.&nbsp; Have a

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.700
festival lynching in
Natchez and you might find,

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:46.300
three or four days later,
in a storefront window,

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:51.200
somebody's knee.&nbsp; W.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.200
E.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.200
B.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.200
DuBois, who we'll be
talking about next week,

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.300
has this exact experience,
of walking by a window and

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.900
discovering he's
looking at a body part,

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.167
and realizing that a
lynching he'd heard about a

00:29:00.167 --> 00:29:06.167
week earlier, that was part
of that person's body.&nbsp; Now

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:13.700
I mentioned before,
over five thousand people

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:18.000
lynched.&nbsp; The great majority
of whom were black.&nbsp; But who

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.500
were the victims?--aside
from being black men and

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:27.200
white men, also some women,
but very few in number,

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.967
but also some
women.&nbsp; Overwhelmingly,

00:29:31.967 --> 00:29:35.300
the narrative says, these
were black men accused of

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:42.100
rape.&nbsp; Bless you.&nbsp; That was
a very cute sneeze by the

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:47.900
way.&nbsp; We have black men
accused of rape.&nbsp; That's the

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.700
received narrative,
that's the received wisdom,

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.100
and so the presumption is
that there was some justice

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:57.567
being exercised here; that
this black man raped this

00:29:57.567 --> 00:30:00.600
white woman,
whoever that might be,

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.400
and therefore deserves to be
murdered.&nbsp; He has violated

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:10.567
the sanctity of the South.&nbsp;
Much of the language of

00:30:10.567 --> 00:30:14.600
lynching during this
era was on such terms;

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:20.200
that it was a manly act to
protect white womanhood by

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:24.700
avenging the rape; that
black brutes who were

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:30.500
rapists were demonstrating
how uncivilized they were.&nbsp;

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.500
And so again, lynch mobs
were being civilized.&nbsp;

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.600
They're protecting the
bastions of being civilized,

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:42.100
of civilized behavior, and
protecting their women.&nbsp;

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:50.100
Manliness and civilization.&nbsp;
People though,

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.667
as it turns out, were
lynched for a variety of

00:30:51.667 --> 00:30:57.600
reasons, not just for the
accusation of rape.&nbsp; You can

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:02.667
sense--you can hear some of
these reasons--you can also

00:31:02.667 --> 00:31:07.700
hear rape, by the
way--with a quote from a

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.500
woman--woman's
rights activist,

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:15.567
a very prominent one, named
Rebecca Latimer Felton.

00:31:15.567 --> 00:31:19.600
Once a slave owner--in a
family of slave owners.&nbsp; And

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:26.867
actually, in a strange
way, as such an advocate for

00:31:26.867 --> 00:31:31.667
women's rights, she's
actually also advocating for

00:31:31.667 --> 00:31:38.000
protection of black women,
which was unusual.&nbsp; But she

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.167
was quite convinced that
black men were rapists,

00:31:41.167 --> 00:31:45.600
and they deserved their
punishment.&nbsp; Rebecca Felton

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.800
says here, "When there is
not enough religion in the

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.600
pulpit to organize a
crusade against sin;

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.500
nor in justice in the court
house--nor justice in the

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.200
court house to
promptly punish crime;

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.067
nor manhood enough in the
nation to put a sheltering

00:32:04.067 --> 00:32:06.300
arm about
innocence and virtue,

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:12.300
it is lynching--it is
lynching to protect woman's

00:32:19.967 --> 00:32:27.400
dearest possession from the
ravening human beasts--if it

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.867
is lynching to protect
woman's dearest possession

00:32:29.867 --> 00:32:31.967
from the
ravening human beasts,

00:32:31.967 --> 00:32:35.767
then I say lynch.&nbsp; Lynch a
thousand times a week if

00:32:35.767 --> 00:32:37.767
necessary."

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:44.200
Felton is talking about
moral order: if there's not

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.900
enough religion in the
pulpit to organize a crusade

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.600
against sin.&nbsp; Talking about
legal justice: if we can't

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.500
have our criminals be
brought to court and tried.&nbsp;

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:59.100
And she's talking about
manhood again: if we cannot

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.100
as a nation
protect our women,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.800
and if lynching is
the way to do it,

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:11.100
then by God, lynch a
thousand times a week.&nbsp; Now

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:18.167
I said that lynching
is the--seen as the,

00:33:18.167 --> 00:33:22.200
the answer for rapists,
especially for black male

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:29.500
rapists, and that is
the received wisdom.&nbsp; But

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.567
really, what was it?&nbsp; Ida B.

00:33:32.567 --> 00:33:35.800
Wells, black
woman journalist,

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.600
becomes an incredible
civil rights pioneer,

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.300
one of the
founders of the NAACP,

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:44.500
not yet organized.&nbsp; Ida B.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.967
Wells lives in
Memphis, Tennessee,

00:33:46.967 --> 00:33:52.500
and of course she hears
about the scourge of the

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:56.100
black male attacking white
womanhood and raping women

00:33:56.100 --> 00:34:01.000
and children.&nbsp; And then she
has a horrific experience.&nbsp;

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.267
One of her friends, a guy
named Thomas Moses--Moss,

00:34:05.267 --> 00:34:08.200
opens up a store, "The
People's Grocery."&nbsp; He's a

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:15.300
black man.&nbsp; And he creates
economic competition for a

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:18.867
store owned by whites
very close by.&nbsp; And that

00:34:18.867 --> 00:34:21.367
white-owned store was the
store that catered to that

00:34:21.367 --> 00:34:24.700
whole area, white and black
customers.&nbsp; And Thomas Moss

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:25.767
said, "This is
an opportunity.

00:34:25.767 --> 00:34:28.867
I want to open a store as
well."&nbsp; And the owners of

00:34:28.867 --> 00:34:30.867
the other store threatened
him.&nbsp; "Do not do this.&nbsp; If

00:34:30.867 --> 00:34:32.967
you do this, you will
pay."&nbsp; And Moss says,

00:34:32.967 --> 00:34:35.100
"I'm just opening, you know,
opening a store."&nbsp; Well,

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:39.500
he paid with his life.&nbsp; He
was lynched for opening up

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.700
the store.&nbsp; He did not lynch
anybody.&nbsp; He did not steal

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:46.000
from anybody.&nbsp; I guess he
stole potential customers,

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.600
I suppose, but he was
lynched.&nbsp; Wells writes

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.900
editorials,
organizes a boycott,

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:04.000
and then in short order had
to flee Memphis to save her

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.600
life, because she was trying
to pull back the cover of

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.500
this lie about the
connection between rape and

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:17.900
lynching.&nbsp; She would not
return to Memphis for fear

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:22.300
of her life until the very
end of her life.&nbsp; Decades go

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:25.300
by.&nbsp; She's convinced she
will be killed if she steps

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:31.600
foot back in the city.&nbsp; At
that moment when her friend

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:35.300
was murdered for
opening a store,

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.300
Ida B.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.000
Wells sets out to
demonstrate that lynching,

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.500
claimed as being a way to
keep uncivilized blacks

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:50.867
down, was actually the
perfect manifestation of

00:35:50.867 --> 00:35:54.067
uncivilized
white male behavior,

00:35:54.067 --> 00:36:01.767
and she starts saying
this publicly.&nbsp; She starts

00:36:01.767 --> 00:36:07.000
writing consistently in ways
where she's deemed--she's

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
deemed a threat to
Southern manhood.

00:36:10.867 --> 00:36:14.600
And because she also claimed
that white women often

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.700
desired the interracial
dalliances where they--where

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:23.900
they actually did exist, she
had crossed the final line

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.900
of taboo, that white women
might actually desire black

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:34.800
men.&nbsp; She asked, "If the
South is so against rape,

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.167
why aren't white men
lynched?"&nbsp; There's a long

00:36:38.167 --> 00:36:42.500
history of certainly white
slave owners raping their

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.267
slaves, having children.

00:36:45.267 --> 00:36:47.900
And certainly
after Emancipation,

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:51.967
you know, rape knew no color
line really.&nbsp; "So why aren't

00:36:51.967 --> 00:36:52.967
white men being lynched?"

00:36:52.967 --> 00:36:59.067
she wonders.&nbsp; And then she
goes off to England on a

00:36:59.067 --> 00:37:02.267
speaking tour, again on this
anti-lynching crusade.&nbsp; And

00:37:02.267 --> 00:37:06.467
this is where she really
becomes a persona non grata

00:37:06.467 --> 00:37:11.100
in the South.&nbsp; Southern
US at the time had a very

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.200
strong connection to
the notions of British

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.200
civilizationist hierarchies;
that the British were the

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.600
height of civilized society
in the world at that point

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.300
in time, and the South,
with their aristocratic

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:27.267
traditions, wanted to be
very much like the English

00:37:27.267 --> 00:37:29.700
model in that way.&nbsp; Ida B.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:31.900
Wells goes over and starts
talking about lynching,

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:35.800
starts investigating.&nbsp; She
goes on these investigations

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.100
and reports the
investigations.&nbsp; And it

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:41.800
turns out, as you'll see in
the reading for next week,

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.500
the accusation of rape isn't
even there in most of the

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:49.967
lynchings.&nbsp; So there's the
popular idea that rape leads

00:37:49.967 --> 00:37:54.500
to lynching, but that's
not even the case in the

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:58.100
majority of the
situations.&nbsp; Theft,

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:03.800
rude behavior,
assault, certainly,

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:07.600
all of these things lead to
people being lynched.&nbsp; And

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.600
Ida B.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:12.500
Wells tells this
to her audiences,

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.900
women's audiences and
men's audiences in England,

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:20.200
starts talking about the
way that Southern white men

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:27.700
actually epitomize
uncivilized behavior.&nbsp; And

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.600
you have society in England
start sending investigatory

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:34.700
groups over to the South,
profoundly humiliating to

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:40.167
Southern--Southern cities
and towns where these groups

00:38:40.167 --> 00:38:43.700
might appear.&nbsp; The
South is enraged at Ida B.

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:50.800
Wells and her inappropriate
behavior.&nbsp; Now this is an

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.800
era--and I'll speak a little
bit more about this next

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.800
week--an era where the
notion of who is the most

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.600
civilized is really quite
important.&nbsp; It may sound

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:03.667
kind of strange today,
but this was one of the

00:39:03.667 --> 00:39:06.400
important organizing themes
of cultures and societies:

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:15.767
having good manners, acting
in proper ways.&nbsp; These

00:39:15.767 --> 00:39:19.400
become dividing lines
between who can have access

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:26.500
to economic opportunities
and who can't.&nbsp; Who's

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:32.700
civilized?&nbsp; Who's manly?&nbsp;
For many Southerners,

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:36.000
it seemed like it
wasn't even a question,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.300
it's beyond debate.&nbsp;
Ida B.&nbsp; Wells says,

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:42.600
"Not so fast."&nbsp; Now we'll
work through a little bit

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:45.000
more this notion of
civilization and manliness,

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.900
well, in section I hope,
but certainly in next week's

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.800
reading.&nbsp; But with all
this talk about lynching and

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.567
anti-lynching crusades,
it was--there's really an

00:39:51.567 --> 00:39:53.567
important piece of the
puzzle that's missing.&nbsp;

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.367
Because the conversations
about this can actually seem

00:39:57.367 --> 00:40:04.300
a little bit
antiseptic.&nbsp; Lynching was,

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:10.300
and remains, a horribly
violent and grotesque act.&nbsp;

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.800
Ten years
ago--in fact, gosh,

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.867
exactly ten years ago--small
gallery in New York City,

00:40:19.867 --> 00:40:24.500
the Roth Horowitz Gallery,
assembles an exhibit called

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.967
"Witness: Photographs
of Lynchings from the

00:40:26.967 --> 00:40:31.200
Collection of James Allen,"
a white man who collected

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.467
photographs and postcards of
lynching scenes.&nbsp; This is a

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:37.800
curious
phenomenon, by the way.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:42.800
I mean, I use "curious" in a
fully complicated way.&nbsp; At

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.800
these festival
lynchings especially,

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.867
you would have photographers
present who would take

00:40:46.867 --> 00:40:50.900
pictures, not for
the historical record,

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.100
but to sell next to the
kneecaps and genitals in the

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.700
storefront window.&nbsp; Studio
photography of lynchings.&nbsp;

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.667
Lynchings would
appear--Lynching scenes

00:40:58.667 --> 00:41:01.500
would appear on postcards
and would go through the

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:05.600
mail till the postmaster
general prohibited it in the

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:10.500
1920s, I believe.&nbsp; Anyway,
the collector named James

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:14.467
Allen gathered up a fair
amount of these photographs

00:41:14.467 --> 00:41:17.400
and postcards, and the
owners of the Roth Horowitz

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.967
Gallery's would put it
together.&nbsp; They're very

00:41:18.967 --> 00:41:20.700
nervous about it, but
they wanted to do it,

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.400
not from the
standpoint of spectacle,

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.167
which is what their concern
was.&nbsp; They didn't want to

00:41:24.167 --> 00:41:27.600
spectacularize this
violence all over again,

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.267
but to talk about the
historical record.&nbsp; These

00:41:29.267 --> 00:41:31.600
are-these are
horrific images,

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.900
and the fact that they were
carried in the mail openly,

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.200
the fact that they
were sold in the windows,

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:39.667
is an important part of our
national story that we need

00:41:39.667 --> 00:41:45.100
to know.&nbsp; Very
controversial exhibit,

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:47.067
very small gallery.&nbsp; They
moved it soon to the New

00:41:47.067 --> 00:41:48.067
York State--the
New York, excuse me,

00:41:48.067 --> 00:41:51.367
the New York Historical
Society in Manhattan,

00:41:51.367 --> 00:41:52.600
where there were
lines around the block,

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.400
who were very conflicted
about this exhibit,

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.500
but they still went
in.&nbsp; Some people said,

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.267
"You can't, you can't show
these things because they're

00:42:00.267 --> 00:42:02.300
so horrific."&nbsp; Others said,
"That's exactly why you have

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.100
to show them."&nbsp; Black and
white on both sides of that

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:09.167
debate, by the way.&nbsp; I want
to share with you some of

00:42:09.167 --> 00:42:13.200
these images.&nbsp; I do not do
it to spectacularize these

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:18.900
very awful, awful images,
but to help you all to bear

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:21.100
witness in a way
to the violence,

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:24.900
and atrocities, and
inhumanity--in a clinical

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:30.467
sense, the denial of due
process for black victims in

00:42:30.467 --> 00:42:32.667
the era of Southern
Redemption.&nbsp; Now the images

00:42:32.667 --> 00:42:34.467
you're going to see
cover, chronologically,

00:42:34.467 --> 00:42:37.367
a broader period of time.&nbsp;
We're not just talking the

00:42:37.367 --> 00:42:41.100
1860s, 1870s, eighties
here, nineties.&nbsp; But,

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:45.000
I think you will understand
what's going on.&nbsp; Now I'm

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:51.100
going to show this, this
slideshow.&nbsp; It runs on its

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:54.267
own, and at the end
of the slideshow,

00:42:54.267 --> 00:43:00.267
the screen goes black, class
is dismissed.&nbsp; And I'll have

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:08.800
side comments to where
the handwriting might be a

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:13.700
little bit illegible.&nbsp;
There were before and after

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:19.700
images.&nbsp; Same
man you just saw,

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.200
his head impaled,
his burned head,

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.400
impaled on the stake.&nbsp; The
handwriting would be put

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:30.100
there by the photographer,
so it could be identified

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:33.967
when he sold it in
the store.&nbsp; Litchfield,

00:43:33.967 --> 00:43:35.300
Kentucky.&nbsp;
September Twenty-Six,

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:39.900
1913, in what would
appear to be sort of a town

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:45.900
center.&nbsp; Studio shots.&nbsp; And
you would have individuals,

00:43:54.067 --> 00:43:56.300
as you'll see, in the
background.&nbsp; You can see

00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:02.300
them [gestures up] directly
above my hand.&nbsp; This is

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.067
actually a series of images
you're going to see here.&nbsp;

00:44:23.067 --> 00:44:28.500
And you'll see the physical
assault on the body prior to

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.067
the actual terminal event.

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:39.600
Body's been whipped.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.367
&nbsp;He's been whipped.&nbsp; His
back has been gouged and

00:44:41.367 --> 00:44:48.500
speared.&nbsp; And one very
curious thing about the

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:53.800
studio photography is
that They would cover up the

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:59.500
victim's genitals,
despite showing all of this,

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:05.500
to be proper.&nbsp; This is the
same studio from another

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:13.800
image.&nbsp; Several
images--several slides ago.&nbsp;

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:19.800
She was lynched next to
her son.&nbsp; It's the back of a

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.800
postcard.

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.100
"The answer of the
Anglo-Saxon race to black

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.300
brutes who would attack the
womanhood of the South."&nbsp;

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:36.900
Here's the answer.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:42.900
That's the front of
the postcard.&nbsp; Another

00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:00.600
postcard.&nbsp; "This is the
barbecue we had last night.&nbsp;

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.867
My picture is to the left
with the cross over it.

00:46:02.867 --> 00:46:04.867
Your son, Joe."

00:46:17.467 --> 00:46:19.800
&nbsp; Again, for
propriety's sake,

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:25.800
a cloth around the
midsection.&nbsp; Festival

00:46:29.467 --> 00:46:33.467
lynching, you
can--people brought dates,

00:46:33.467 --> 00:46:38.867
they brought their
children.&nbsp; You can tell by

00:46:38.867 --> 00:46:40.967
the apparel, this is
of more recent vintage,

00:46:40.967 --> 00:46:44.600
not back in 1911 or '12.&nbsp;
Lynchings were of course

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:50.600
being burned at the stake.&nbsp;
And they're still fairly

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.800
contemporary.&nbsp;

00:47:15.267 --> 00:47:17.500
And class is dismissed.

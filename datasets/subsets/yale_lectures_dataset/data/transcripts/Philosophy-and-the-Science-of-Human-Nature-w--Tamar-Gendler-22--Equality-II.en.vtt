00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.650
PROFESSOR: So the topic of
today's lecture, as you can

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.000
see from the title,
is liberty.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.530
And the best way to get a sense
of the project in which

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.010
we will find ourselves engaged
today is to contrast the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.330
opening pages of Rawls' Theory
of Justice with the opening

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.830
pages of Nozick's Anarchy,
State, and Utopia.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.170
So you'll recall that when we
were reading the Rawls--

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.580
for some reason the remote is
not working, that's a pity but

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.430
there we go--

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.510
you'll recall that when we were
reading the Rawls, Rawls

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.720
began his text by speaking of
justice as the first virtue of

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.300
social institutions.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.120
It plays the role with regard
to the legitimacy of an

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.500
institution that truth plays
with regard to the legitimacy

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.670
of a system of thought.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.420
Each person, says Rawls,
"possesses an inviolability

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.960
founded on justice that even
the welfare of society as a

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.640
whole cannot override." For
this reason, says Rawls

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.530
famously in these opening pages,
"justice denies that

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.930
the loss of freedom for some
is made right by a greater

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.340
good shared by others"

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.270
So Rawls is concerned with and
inviolability of humanity

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.240
based on a notion of justice.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.650
Nozick is also concerned with
a kind of inviolability.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.200
But rather than seeing the core
of that inviolability as

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.850
lying in some notion of justice
he sees it as lying in

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.210
a notion of rights.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.270
So he says in the opening of
the preface, the first

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.350
sentence which you
read for today.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.950
"Individuals have rights and
there are things that no

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.080
person or group may do to them
without violating those

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.280
rights." And he goes on to say
that "the minimal state

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.340
limited to the narrow functions
of protection

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.050
against force, theft, fraud, the
enforcement of contracts

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.570
and so on is the most extensive

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.480
state that can be justified.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.740
Any state more extensive than
the minimal state violates

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.810
people's rights."

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.640
So there's something
extraordinarily interesting

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.530
going on in this
pair of works.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.630
Both of them are concerned with
the fundamental question

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.060
which we first encountered in
the context of Hobbes: how

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.060
could it be that it's legitimate
to have a state?

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.860
Both of them are concerned with
structuring the state in

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.500
such a way that it doesn't
violate that which is

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.890
perceived as being on their
picture as inviolable.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.820
But they differ profoundly in
what sort of state they end up

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.030
calling legitimate.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.660
Perhaps because at the core of
Rawls's picture lies the

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.370
notion of justice, whereas at
the core of Nozick's picture

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.700
lies the notion of rights.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.940
So what I want to do in today's
lecture is to contrast

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.650
some of the themes, which we
encountered last lecture in

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.160
the context of Rawls' Theory
of Justice by looking at a

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.810
particular famous chapter of his
colleague Robert Nozick's

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.060
work, Anarchy, State,
and Utopia.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.230
Even from the brief selections
that you read from these two

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.590
works, the differences between
them should have

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.890
been evident to you.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.430
They were written a mere
three years apart.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.210
Rawls' Theory of Justice
was published in 1971.

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.430
Nozick's Anarchy, State,
and Utopia three

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.770
years later in 1974.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.240
Rawls and Nozick at the time had
offices down the hall from

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.790
one another.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:37.030
But Rawls' work, as you will
feel, is part of a major

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.130
philosophical project.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.680
It's extraordinarily
self reflective.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.050
Rawls is in his middle age
when he writes it.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.360
And he's been thinking about
these questions for decades.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.950
Nozick's book is an
extraordinarily insightful

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.890
response to Rawls, as well
as being a positive

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.650
formulation of a view.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.050
But it's not a work with the
gravitas of Theory of Justice.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.910
It was written when Nozick
was quite young.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.980
He was in his early 30s.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.520
And it's important to know that
although these works are

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.125
typically paired in philosophy
courses-- (If you took-- or

00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:21.830
are taking--

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.290
Moral Foundations of Politics
or an introductory political

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.930
theory course, you will get
these two books paired

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.170
together.),--

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.890
Theory of Justice is, if you
look at its citation index,

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.940
more than three times more
influential, if that's the

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.940
measure, than Anarchy,
State, and Utopia.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.030
So Theory of Justice Google
Scholar citation is roughly

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.610
30,000 whereas Anarchy, State,
and Utopia is roughly 10,000.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.540
These are extraordinarily high
numbers in philosophy.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.910
Those of you who have
encountered works in other

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.560
domains of philosophy, for
example Kripke's Naming and

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.760
Necessity, written at about
this time, its citation

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.500
numbers are about half that of
Anarchy, State, and Utopia,

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.260
about 5,000.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.290
So what I want you to take home
from this is the idea

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.920
that these are enormously
influential works with

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.060
consequences far beyond academic
philosophy, but that

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.060
they differ in their tone.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.130
So Anarchy, State, and Utopia
is an attempt to defend the

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:38.690
minimal state from two different
kinds of objections.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:45.330
In the first part of the work,
Nozick defends the state

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.590
against the position
of anarchy.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.950
He argues that a minimal state
is justified, that it's not

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.590
the case that it's a violation
of people's rights to have

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.310
basic enforcement of laws,
police and the sort of

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.900
fundamental things that are
required for the basic

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:11.030
stability of getting out of
Hobbes's state of nature.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.640
The second part of the book,
with which our reading was

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.380
concerned, defends the minimal
state against a more

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.530
maximalist picture.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:28.260
And in that part of the book,
Nozick defends the rights of

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:33.040
people to liberty in two
kinds of domains.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.690
The first is that he defends
people's rights to enter into

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.820
almost any sort of contract
that they would like.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.270
He defends, for example, the
right of people under certain

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.930
conditions to contract
themselves into slavery.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.310
He defends, in other contexts,
the right to have an

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:58.310
enforceable blackmail
contract.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.370
That's not the part of
the book which we

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.500
read excerpts from.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.440
The part of the book that we
read excerpts from, and to

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.780
which the remainder of lecture
will be devoted, is Nozick's

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:16.230
discussion of our relation
to property.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:21.860
So what Nozick tries to do in
the famous seventh chapter of

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:27.590
Anarchy, State, and Utopia is
to articulate a notion of

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.020
justice in holdings--

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.510
that is, justice with respect
to property--

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:39.660
that provides a principled
explanation of the relation

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:44.752
among the three different kinds
of concerns that one has

00:08:44.752 --> 00:08:48.660
in asking about whether it's
legitimate for a person to own

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.480
a piece of property.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.930
The first is the question of
justice in acquisition.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.680
Under what conditions--

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.300
when I initially
come to acquire

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.560
something, say a tomato--

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:09.380
is my acquisition of it such
that my ownership of the

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:14.770
object is in keeping with the
conditions of justice?

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.650
And we'll talk about Nozick's
views on justice in

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.660
acquisition in a minute.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.720
The second question that Nozick
is concerned with here

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.860
is the question of justice
in transfer.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:33.290
So he's concerned with the
question, if I have an object

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.980
and I wish to transfer
possession of that object to

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:42.670
you, under what conditions
is that transfer

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.460
justice-preserving?

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:50.240
And finally, Nozick is concerned
with the question of

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.290
rectification of injustice.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:58.850
So suppose I own something which
you illegitimately take

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:05.740
from me, under what conditions
and how do I reclaim

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.790
possession of that object?

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:17.530
Nozick's argument is that we can
say everything that needs

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:21.460
to be said about justice
in holdings --

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.040
everything that needs to be said
about the distribution of

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.160
property in a society
that doesn't violate

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.560
people's rights --

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:34.150
by appeal to an inductive
definition

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.150
that runs as follows.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:41.220
He says, "If a person acquires
a holding in keeping with the

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:45.690
principle of justice in
acquisition, the person, p, is

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:50.020
entitled to the holding." So, if
I come to own something in

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:56.730
a way that is legitimate,
rule-following, my owning of

00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:03.120
that object is in keeping with
the rules of justice.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.940
The second clause is an
induction clause.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:11.300
"If a person acquires a holding,
in keeping with the

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.780
principle of justice in
transfer, from somebody who

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.190
was entitled--

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:20.160
either as a result of a transfer
or as the result of

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.522
an initial acquisition--

00:11:21.522 --> 00:11:27.970
to hold that object, then the
person is entitled to hold

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.920
that object."

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:35.120
And finally, Nozick has
a closure clause.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.670
"No one is entitled to a holding
except by repeated

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:43.580
applications of one and two."

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.560
Now those of you who have taken
mathematics are familiar

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.422
with this sort of definition.

00:11:50.422 --> 00:11:53.960
If I wanted to provide an
inductive definition of the

00:11:53.960 --> 00:12:00.000
natural numbers, I might begin
by saying "one is a member the

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.170
set of natural numbers."
That's my base clause.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:12.140
I then add, "if anything is a
member of the set of natural

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:19.760
numbers, then that plus one is a
member of the set of natural

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:25.770
numbers." And then I put in
place some sort of closure

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:29.120
condition such that "the natural
numbers," for example,

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.240
"are all and only those things
that satisfy the first and

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.990
second clause."

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:39.030
So the picture that Nozick is
providing us with here is one

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:43.990
that gives us a certain
kind of closed system.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:49.070
So let's see how it works
in a particular case.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:54.750
Nozick stresses that when you
make use of the principles

00:12:54.750 --> 00:13:00.910
that he's articulated here, what
matters is the process

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.230
not the outcome.

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:09.810
So suppose I come to
possess a tomato.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:15.730
It makes all the difference in
the world, on Nozick's view

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.640
what the actual process
by which I came to

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.070
possess that object is.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:26.100
If, for example, there was a
garden down the road from me,

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:31.500
which I didn't own, where a
beautiful tomato sat, and I

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:38.510
took that tomato without
permission, my possession of

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:40.750
that tomato is illegitimate.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.770
Hmm.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.360
Even if there is an alternative
process--

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.610
a hypothetical one--

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:56.590
which I didn't in fact engage
in whereby I could have come

00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:00.370
to have that tomato
legitimately.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:03.900
If a thief takes your property,
says Nozick, it

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.720
doesn't make his possession of
your property legitimate even

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.460
if you could have voluntarily
given it to him.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.980
Moreover, says Nozick, if I
come to possess something

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:21.140
illegitimately and I transfer
it to you--

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.353
even by legitimate means--

00:14:23.353 --> 00:14:29.180
it retains its illegitimate
status.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.752
So the picture that Nozick is
presenting in his discussion

00:14:33.752 --> 00:14:40.550
of holdings is one with the
following characteristics.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.840
Justice in holdings--

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.150
and this will be important for
his critique of Rawls--

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.890
justice in holdings
is historical.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:55.830
It depends on what actually
happened.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:15:00.850
In particular, if something is
owned as result of an unjust

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:06.010
acquisition, it produces
an unjust holding.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.270
If something is owned as
a result of an unjust

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:14.090
acquisition plus a just
transfer, it still produces an

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.210
unjust holding.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:19.580
If something is owned as the
results of a just acquisition

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:24.590
and an unjust transfer, it
produces an unjust holding.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.560
And if something is owned
as a result of an unjust

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.110
acquisition and an unjust
transfer, it's not that these

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.090
two injustices cancel
one another out.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:37.630
Rather we have, again,
an unjust holding.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:42.230
It's under two conditions
that holdings are

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.690
just on Nozick's picture.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.830
The first is if it's a
straightforward just

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:49.430
acquisition.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:54.100
And the second is if there's a
just acquisition followed by

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.764
one or more just transfers.

00:15:57.764 --> 00:16:04.260
So far this isn't getting Nozick
very far in terms of a

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.400
critique of Rawls.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:12.850
But the next step will allow you
to see how this notion of

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:19.680
justice in property does work
on the Nozick picture.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:25.890
What Nozick goes on to say is
that the holdings of a person

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:29.730
are just if he's entitled to
them by the principles of

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:34.550
justice in acquisition and
transfer or in imperfect

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.240
situations by the principle
of rectification.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.020
That is, it is a necessary
condition on justice in

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:44.599
holding that they have been
acquired through one

00:16:44.599 --> 00:16:47.260
of these two steps.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:53.660
But it is also a sufficient
condition.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:17:01.400
If each person's holdings are
just then there are no more

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:07.880
questions to be asked about the
aggregation of holdings.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:13.590
If each person's holdings are
just, then the distribution of

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:16.940
holdings is just.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:23.360
So we'll see when we get to
justice in transfer how it is

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:30.030
that this notion, both of taking
historical properties

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.630
as the relevant ones in
determining justice and in

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:38.440
taking the inductive property
holding characterization as

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:43.360
necessary and sufficient for
justice in holdings, how it is

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.880
that those pair of things
provides Nozick with the

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:52.970
leverage to criticize the
outlook to which all of you

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:56.290
from behind the veil of
ignorance last class-- or the

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.200
majority of you from
behind the veil of

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.510
ignorance last class--

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:03.190
seems to think was what
justice mandated.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:08.550
That is, Nozick takes from this
very simple picture an

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:13.660
argument, which from his
perspective renders

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:18.110
illegitimate any sort
of centralized

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:22.050
redistribution of resources.

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:28.190
So you remember, in order to
evaluate Nozick's inductive

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:32.390
definition that we need to know
what it is that he thinks

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:35.085
justice in acquisition
involves.

00:18:35.085 --> 00:18:41.240
And what it is that he thinks
justice in transfer involves.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:46.760
So the discussion of justice
in acquisition is a rather

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:51.270
complicated portion of the text
that I had you read for

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.630
today's class.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:19:01.390
What Nozick does is to make
appeal to the work of the 17th

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:08.620
century philosopher John Locke,
whose Second Treatise

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:14.350
on Government begins
its discussion

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:18.210
of property as follows.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:23.370
Locke writes, "Though the
Earth and all inferior

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:28.120
creatures be common to all
men, yet every man has a

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.490
property in his own person.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:35.450
This nobody has any right
to but himself.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:40.000
The labor of his body and the
work of his hands we may say

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.640
are properly his."

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.960
So on Locke's picture of the
state of nature there's a

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.370
world out there unowned.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.730
We're setting aside a set
of concerns about

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.540
whether this picture--

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.460
that the Earth and all inferior
creatures belong in

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.170
any principled sense to human
beings-- and rather looking at

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:07.620
what it is that Locke's argument
for the justice in

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.530
acquisition clause involves.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:13.370
So Locke says, the world out
there of objects doesn't

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:14.830
belong to anybody.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:19.960
But what each person does have
is the rights to his or her

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:25.670
own body and, in particular,
possession, ownership rights

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.700
over his labor.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:34.500
So, says Locke, "Whatsoever he
removes out of the state that

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:39.520
nature hath provided and left in
it he hath mixed his labor

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.180
with and joined it to something
that is his own and

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:50.050
thereby makes it his property."
Concluding, "It

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:54.070
being by him removed from the
common state nature placed it

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:58.680
in, it hath by this labor
something annexed to it that

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:02.120
excludes the common right
of other men.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.400
For this labor being the
unquestionable property of the

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:13.290
laborer, no man but he can have
a right to what that is

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:17.870
once joined to, at least when
there is enough, and as good,

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:21.460
left in common for others."

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.420
So Nozick takes from
this discussion

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.720
of Locke two things.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.540
The first thing he takes is the
idea that what justice in

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:38.770
acquisition involves is a
certain kind of mixing of what

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:43.880
is one's own, one's labor,
with something that is

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.130
previously unowned --

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:51.910
potential property in
the state of nature.

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:58.120
And although Nozick has all
sorts of criticisms about the

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.730
unclarity of this
characterization.

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:04.680
He says, for example, "If I
go to Mars and sweep off a

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.070
portion of the planet,
have I thereby

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:09.290
claimed just that portion?

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:13.010
Have I claimed the entire
planet of Mars?

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:17.906
Have I claimed all of the
planets that lie beyond it?"

00:22:17.906 --> 00:22:21.460
He also asks why it is that
mixing one's labor with

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:25.030
something should lead to
possession of the object

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:28.190
rather than the losing
of one's labor.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:32.950
But ultimately he's willing to
accept that something like the

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:37.030
Lockean picture is going
to underlie justice in

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:38.710
acquisition.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:43.390
What worries him, and what he
devotes the bulk of the

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:49.190
selection that you read for last
night to, is this concern

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:55.510
about whether what he calls the
Lockean Proviso, the idea

00:22:55.510 --> 00:23:00.470
that in order for acquisition
to be legitimate there needs

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:06.440
to be enough and as good left
in common for others.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:12.130
Whether Proviso is frequently
violated.

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:16.520
Because if that Proviso were
frequently violated then

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:20.650
justice in acquisitions
wouldn't be simple and

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:24.870
straightforward in the way that
Nozick wants it to be.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:28.840
So the basic structure of the
argument that you read--

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.260
and I'll run through it in
more detail in a minute--

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.550
the basic structure of the
argument that you read in the

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:39.330
context of Nozick's discussion
of Locke runs as follows.

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.710
Locke has a reasonable picture
of what acquisition of

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:44.370
property involves.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:48.010
We need to fuss with it around
the edges but I'm not going to

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:50.290
worry about that, says Nozick.

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:54.610
What I am going to worry about
is whether this notion of

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:57.900
there being "enough and as
good left in common for

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:02.840
others" is going to undercut
the whole Lockean picture.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.790
So what's the idea look like?

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:12.300
Suppose that four of us come
upon a field of previously

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.910
unclaimed cows.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:24.180
And that one of us claims
four of the cows.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:28.370
And then a second of us claims
six of the cows and a third of

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:32.110
us claims the remaining
six cows.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:38.440
Has the Lockean Proviso
been violated?

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:44.380
Nozick's first worry, which he
calls the unzipping worry, is

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:49.190
that perhaps it's not just the
blue character who took the

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:52.740
last six cows who's violated
the Lockean Proviso.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:56.540
Perhaps the yellow character,
in limiting the blue

00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:00.670
character, has violated it and
the red character, in limiting

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.700
the yellow character by limiting
the blue character,

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:08.350
has somehow violated the
Lockean Proviso.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:11.540
Nozick says no.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:16.530
The fact that the red
character's activities limited

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:19.420
the yellow character's
activities, if we took into

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:23.270
consideration the blue
character's activities, is not

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:28.260
sufficient to render red or
yellow in violation of the

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.430
Lockean Proviso.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:33.570
So that's step one.

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:37.530
But we still might wonder
whether the blue character has

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:39.270
violated the Lockean Proviso.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:45.480
After all, how could he have
left as much and as good for

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.320
our fourth character--

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.990
pink over here--

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:54.900
if pink isn't in a position
to get any cows?

00:25:54.900 --> 00:26:03.590
Nozick's answer is that in
taking on ownership of objects

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:08.230
and mixing one's labor with
them, typically what the

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.770
subject does is to increase
the value of

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:14.210
those objects for all.

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:17.460
So red, from his four
cows, might produce

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.300
one gallon of milk.

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:26.696
And yellow might produce two and
blue might produce three.

00:26:26.696 --> 00:26:29.070
As a result, pink--

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:31.790
though he doesn't have
access to the cows--

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:34.030
is better off.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:40.550
And, says Nozick, the Lockean
Proviso has not been violated.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:45.700
So what Nozick says in
particular, is he asks whether

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:49.490
the situation of persons who
are unable to appropriate--

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:53.770
there being no more acceptable
and unowned objects--

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:58.320
is their situation worsened
by a system of allowing

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.770
appropriation and private
property?

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:05.710
And the answer he gives
is a resounding no.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:08.440
For exactly the sort of reasons
that we're familiar

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.690
with from our Hobbes case --

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:16.320
the idea that there is a kind of
social contract that kicks

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.136
in that allows everybody
to benefit.

00:27:19.136 --> 00:27:23.100
And also because Nozick firmly
believes that individual

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:28.310
ownership brings with it a
particular kind of efficiency.

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:34.340
So Nozick's worry, which was:
is the Lockean Proviso going

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:38.100
to knock my theory out of the
water such that I can't get

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:41.470
the base clause of my inductive
argument going?

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:45.680
Nozick's conclusion is that
appropriation of private

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:50.490
property satisfies the intent
behind the "enough and as good

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:53.650
left over" Proviso.

00:27:53.650 --> 00:28:00.910
But, he is careful to point
out, this is not based on

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:03.740
utilitarian reasoning.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:07.340
It's not based on a utilitarian

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.390
justification of property.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:11.390
Nozick--

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:13.040
like Rawls--

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:18.450
is concerned with articulating
a rights based theory.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:23.750
And so, like Rawls, doesn't
allow trade-offs

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:27.200
of rights for utilities.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.970
So the argument about the
original acquisition of

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:34.300
property runs as follows.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:39.540
Nozick says, I have the right to
do everything that doesn't

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:43.880
harm others and the right
to do only what

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.570
doesn't harm others.

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:50.540
My rights begin and end in
their restrictions and

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:57.750
permissions with consideration
of what brings harm to others.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:03.190
Violating the Lockean Proviso,
if I managed to do that, would

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:06.880
leave others worse off than they
would have been otherwise

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.250
and consequently would
harm them.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:13.410
As a consequence, says Nozick,
I don't have the right to

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:15.400
violate the Lockean Proviso.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.120
If, as a matter of fact, my
original acquisition of

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:24.070
property doesn't leave as much
and as good for others, then

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:28.410
my original acquisition was
not an instance of just

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:30.790
property ownership.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:36.150
But, says Nozick, except
in very rare cases--

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:40.070
he calls them conditions of
catastrophe or desert island

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:41.440
limitations--

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:45.130
acquiring property doesn't
violate the Lockean Proviso or

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:47.050
harm others.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:52.350
And the argument for this
sub-clause, this sub-argument,

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:55.450
is a utility- based argument.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:59.730
It's on the grounds of utility
that I get the premise that

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:03.050
except in rare cases acquiring
property doesn't violate the

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:04.890
Lockean Proviso.

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:08.440
But the fundamental argument, I
have the right to do all and

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.270
only what doesn't harm others.

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.540
Except in very rare cases
acquiring property does not

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:16.800
violate the Lockean Proviso
and harm others.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:21.850
That one, plus four, is
sufficient to give us the

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:28.550
conclusion that except in very
rare cases I have the right to

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:30.820
acquire property.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:35.390
So that is, by way of
exposition, of what I

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:40.060
understand to have been a fairly
difficult part of the

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.270
assigned text.

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:48.160
So let's move now to an easier
segment of the text.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:53.530
So as we noted, Nozick provides
his defense of the

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:57.040
base clause by appeal to Locke's
notion of original

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.990
acquisition of property and
defends that against the

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:02.430
potential objection--

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.890
the Lockean Proviso
objection--

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:10.380
in providing a clearer sense
of what that amounts to.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:15.700
In many ways the most famous
part of the text comes in

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:20.370
Nozick's defense of the
induction clause.

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:24.070
So in defending the induction
clause -- which, remember,

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:29.670
says that if P acquires H, in
keeping with the principle of

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:32.970
justice in transfer, from
somebody already entitled,

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.080
that P is entitled to H --

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.170
Nozick is concerned with
what justice in

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:41.340
transfer amounts to.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.320
So he begins by distinguishing
something that should be

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:49.240
familiar to all of you from your
readings of Mill and Kant

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.360
earlier this semester.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:55.070
He distinguishes between
principles that are

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:56.430
historical--

00:31:56.430 --> 00:32:00.960
that is that tell us that
whether a distribution is just

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.100
depends upon how
it came about.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.960
That is, what we are concerned
with when we are concerned

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:12.220
about justice is a question
of process.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:16.390
And he contrasts those with
what he calls end-result

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:21.950
principles where, whether a
distribution is just depends

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:26.790
upon how things are
distributed.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:30.720
So you'll remember that when
we were reading Kant and

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:37.350
trying to determine whether an
action counted as moral or

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:42.250
morally praiseworthy, Kant was
concerned about the process by

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:46.180
which that action
was carried out.

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:52.620
Mill, by contrast, was concerned
with outcome.

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:58.080
Nozick goes on, in the opening
parts of chapter seven that we

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:05.220
read, to provide a defense of
historical principles and to

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:12.500
argue that one consequence of
that will be that we can never

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:19.970
judge the justice of a society
by looking at how its goods

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:22.700
are distributed.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:30.150
So, he points out, it has been
typical in the articulation of

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:34.660
theories of justice, to claim
that a society is just if

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.590
goods are distributed according
to some sort of

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:40.250
independently specifiable
criterion.

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:44.350
For example, distribute goods
according to the moral merit

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:47.619
of those who receive them, or
according to the intelligence

00:33:47.619 --> 00:33:51.380
of those who receive them or
according to the effort that

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:55.980
individuals put in, or according
to their need for

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.790
the objects that
you distribute.

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:03.900
Nozick points out that people
want their society to look

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:11.270
just. And they also want their
society to be just. But in

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:16.739
asking their society to look
just, Nozick thinks they make

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:22.679
a mistake if they take pattern
as a way of determining

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:24.679
legitimate outcome.

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:29.370
Must the look of justice, asks
Nozick, reside in a resulting

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:34.570
pattern, which we can specify
independently and in advance

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:39.860
rather than in the underlying
generating principles?

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:44.760
And to think about this, it's
helpful to help ourselves to a

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:48.950
three-way distinction that
John Rawls makes in the

00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:53.670
context of Theory of Justice.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:58.180
Rawls distinguishes between
three kinds of procedural

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.400
justice there.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.100
The first is a notion
of what he calls

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.420
perfect procedural justice.

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:08.470
This is a case where we have an
independent criterion for

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:14.050
what the right result of our
act will be and a procedure

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:18.140
that is certain to give
us that result.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:25.220
So, for example, if I'm trying
to divide a cake, of which all

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:29.430
of us want pieces, there's an
independent criterion for the

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:30.500
right result.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:36.450
Namely each of us gets a piece
of exactly the same size.

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:40.030
And there's a sure procedure for
arriving at that result.

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:45.730
What I do is I allow one person
to slice and that is

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:52.180
the person who chooses his piece
last. So long as he's in

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:57.120
a position to make precise
cuts, the result of this

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.810
procedure will always give
us what it is that we

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:05.110
independently specified as
the outcome we sought.

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:08.870
We want equal slices, we have
an independent criterion for

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:12.540
the right result, and we
have a sure procedure.

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:16.660
He who slices chooses last.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:22.080
By contrast, in most situations,
what we find

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:27.030
ourselves in is a condition
where our only choice is what

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:30.230
Rawls calls imperfect
procedural justice.

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:34.280
Where we have an independent
criterion for the right result

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:37.280
but the procedure that
we have for achieving

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.960
that result is imperfect.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:44.740
So for example, in the legal
system we have a goal of

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:49.800
convicting all and only those
who are guilty of a crime.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:54.570
We have a clear sense of what
the right result will be.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:58.050
But though we have a procedure
which presumably does a good

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:04.280
deal better than chance, it is
undeniable that on occasion

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:06.470
the guilty go free.

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:10.930
And likewise undeniable
that on occasion the

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:15.090
innocent are convicted.

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:20.370
The third kind of procedural
justice is what Rawls calls

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:22.850
pure procedural justice.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:26.230
This is a case where we have
no independent way of

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:29.070
specifying the result.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:35.160
And what we do is we adopt a
procedure by which we will

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:40.560
carry out in real time, in
actuality, some sort of

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.100
distribution.

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:46.440
And as the result of having
followed that procedure,

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:51.120
whichever distribution
arises is fair.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:54.210
So gambling has this
structure.

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:59.660
There is a rule that we have. We
all pays our money and then

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:01.630
we takes our chances.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:07.200
And whatever distribution of
outcomes results from that is

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.930
legitimate.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:16.770
Nozick's claim is that the
distribution of property in a

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:23.960
society ought to be understood
as subject, not to some sort

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:27.290
of perfect or imperfect
procedural justice.

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:30.900
That is, there's no independent
criterion for how

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:34.960
it is that goods ought to be
distributed across people.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:40.940
Rather, it's simply a matter of
living historically through

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:45.420
a process whereby things are
required in just fashion and

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:50.090
transferred in just fashion,
and seeing how it is that

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:52.170
things distribute themselves.

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:56.720
So in contrast to some sort of
pattern picture, Marx has this

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:01.160
idea, from each according to his
ability to each according

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.610
to his needs.

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:06.160
That's an idea that there's an
independent criterion of how

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.300
things should be distributed.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:12.790
Nozick provides, in contrast,
this rather complicated

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:15.810
articulation: "from each
according to what he chooses

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:22.400
to do and roughly to each as
they are chosen." That is,

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:26.050
however things distribute
themselves, as long as the

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:30.840
process is fair, will
end up being fair.

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:36.100
And this gives rise to Nozick's
famous argument that

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:39.820
liberty upsets patterns.

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:44.150
So Nozick asks us to imagine
a world in which all of our

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:48.760
friends from behind the veil
of ignorance are given

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.860
whatever equal share you
give them in your fair

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.100
distribution.

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.910
So each of them ends up
with a piggy bank of

00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:00.620
the appropriate size.

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:07.270
But all of them, says Nozick,
are basketball fans and they

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:14.440
choose to take a quarter of
their own money and to deposit

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:19.890
it in the bank account
of Wilt Chamberlain.

00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:24.810
And so do their friends and so
do their friends and so do

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:31.220
their friends until, as a result
of people freely doing

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:35.690
what a legitimate transfer
permits, Wilt Chamberlain

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:39.400
comes to have so much money
that his piggy bank gets

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.610
blurry on the slide.

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:45.760
He's that extraordinarily
wealthy.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:50.600
Now Nozick takes the Wilt
Chamberlain example to have

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.840
two implications.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.820
The first is a descriptive
implication.

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:57.350
The general point, he says,
illustrated by the Wilt

00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:01.260
Chamberlain example is that
no end-state principle or

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:05.010
distribution pattern principle
of justice can be continuously

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:07.350
realized without continuous

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:09.950
interference in people's lives.

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:13.980
Any favored pattern will be
transformed into an unfavored

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:16.160
pattern by the principle --

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:20.430
by people exchanging goods and
services with other people or

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:23.990
giving things to other people,
things that the transferers

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:28.160
are entitled to under the
favored distribution pattern.

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.790
To maintain a pattern, one must
either interfere with the

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:36.850
process of transferring
resources, or interfere in

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:40.050
such a way that one takes away
from somebody who has

00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:44.940
legitimately acquired their
pile of quarters and

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:46.280
redistribute that.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.650
To maintain a pattern, says
Nozick, one must either

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:51.220
interfere to stop people from
transferring resources

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:52.500
as they wish to.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:57.060
Or interfere to take from them
resources that others chose to

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.460
transfer to them.

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:02.020
So that's the descriptive
implication of the Wilt

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.020
Chamberlain example.

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.170
There's also a normative
implication of the Wilt

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:08.150
Chamberlain example.

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:11.970
Nozick says this, look if D1,
the initial distribution where

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:15.080
each of our characters from
behind the veil of ignorance

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.860
had their piggy bank, D1 was
a just distribution.

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:23.230
And people voluntarily moved
from D1 to D2, the one where

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:26.830
Wilt Chamberlain ended up with
the large amount of quarters.

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:29.460
Transferring parts of their
shares that they were given

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:33.180
under D1, isn't D2 also just?

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:36.390
If the people were entitled to
dispose of the resources to

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:40.100
which they were entitled under
D1 one, didn't this include

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:44.000
their being entitled to give to,
or exchange it with Wilt

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.240
Chamberlain?

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:48.790
Can anyone else complain
on grounds of justice?

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:52.030
Each other person, says Nozick,
already has his

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:55.850
legitimate share under D1 and
after someone transfers

00:42:55.850 --> 00:43:01.760
something to Wilt Chamberlain,
their shares are not changed.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:06.300
So the descriptive claim is that
liberty will inevitably

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.030
upset patterns.

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:14.200
And the normative claim is that
in so doing, no injustice

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.610
has occurred.

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:20.450
I'm going to close with two
reasons that one might think

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:25.010
that this argument doesn't
work as cleanly as Nozick

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:26.400
would think.

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:31.610
The first we've encountered
already, which is that many

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:36.480
more situations have the
structure of the problem of

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:41.240
the commons than one might
antecedently realize.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:45.250
And it's not always the case
that individual transactions

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:51.130
between pairs of people don't
carry with them third-party

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:53.090
consequences.

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:58.010
The second is that it is
sometimes the case that

00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:03.120
distributions of resources
across individuals in unequal

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:09.860
ways produces violations of
the sorts of freedoms that

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:12.670
Nozick wants to defend.

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:16.710
So suppose we start out with two
groups of people, each of

00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:21.280
whom have roughly similar
amounts of money.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:25.950
And they send their children to
school with one another and

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:30.520
share the same set
of teachers.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:34.890
Suppose that one of those
groups, through legitimate

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:41.170
transfers from D1 to D2, comes
to possess a much larger

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:48.100
amount of money and create
another school where they send

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:53.220
their children and where they
hire the teachers who were the

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:55.420
most gifted.

00:44:55.420 --> 00:45:00.140
It may become the case that
simply as the result of people

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:04.950
having engaged in behavior
that involved a series of

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:10.610
independently legitimate
transfers, the situation that

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:18.870
results may impede the freedom
of these children to become

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:22.180
citizens of the sort
whose rights

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:25.650
Nozick wishes to defend.

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:28.610
So it's 11:20 now.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:31.750
And we'll finish up today's
lecture here.

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:35.270
And move next lecture to finish
up with six discussion

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:38.030
of justice in holdings and to
think about that in the

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:41.170
context of some work in
social psychology.

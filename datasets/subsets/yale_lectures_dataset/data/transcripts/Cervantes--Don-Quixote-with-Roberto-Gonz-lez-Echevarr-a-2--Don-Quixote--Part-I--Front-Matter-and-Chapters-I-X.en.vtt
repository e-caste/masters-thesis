00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.991
Prof: I want to begin by
taking up some general questions

00:00:08.991 --> 00:00:12.930
concerning the Quixote
matters,

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.280
such as the difference between
romance and novel,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.036
because I know from the last
lecture that you must have been

00:00:21.036 --> 00:00:24.620
confused,
and it's good to know it.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.944
Other matters,
which are, what is a chivalric

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:28.700
romance?
 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.630
Because you hear a lot about
it, I'm sure,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.420
and very few people know what a
chivalric romance was--

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:47.090
and who were the Spanish
precursors of Cervantes,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.210
because I want to,
as much as possible,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.805
although in English,
to give you a Cervantes in his

00:00:53.805 --> 00:00:56.214
own sauce,
as it were, that is,

00:00:56.214 --> 00:01:00.542
within the Spanish tradition,
as well as a European,

00:01:00.542 --> 00:01:03.700
but within the Spanish
tradition.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.980
I do that to counter versions
of the Quixote taught

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.337
here at Yale in the English
Department and Directed Studies

00:01:12.337 --> 00:01:15.093
and so forth,
valuable courses,

00:01:15.093 --> 00:01:20.052
but in which Cervantes is seen
only in the context of western

00:01:20.052 --> 00:01:21.209
literature.
 

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:24.682
So this is why I want to give
you Cervantes,

00:01:24.682 --> 00:01:28.235
as much as possible,
in his own salsa,

00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:30.900
as it were, in his own sauce.
 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.715
Now, I will begin by continuing
on the issue of what and why

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:47.060
the Quixote has continued
to be read, why it has had such

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.709
common currency.
 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:56.459
I just learned yesterday that
the detainees in Guantanamo,

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:02.500
Cuba asked for the
Quixote, first of all,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.099
of all of the books that they
want to read.

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.635
Now, I have offered the most
common of answers about why

00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:16.419
the Quixote is so
current, the least specialized.

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:20.603
The one that I assume general
readers will understand about

00:02:20.603 --> 00:02:24.787
wanting to be other and so
forth, that I spoke about in the

00:02:24.787 --> 00:02:25.870
last class.
 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.878
But Don Quixote is
notoriously about literature,

00:02:31.878 --> 00:02:36.220
covering the entire range of
'about.'

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.865
First and first most it's about
the effect that literature has

00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:42.160
on its readers.
 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.210
Don Quixote goes mad 'cause he
reads too much literature.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.791
Literature, fiction,
allows us to rehearse in

00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:59.247
private our most secret desires
affecting our lives as if these

00:02:59.247 --> 00:03:02.060
desires have come true.
 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.538
It's like dreams.
 

00:03:03.538 --> 00:03:06.060
Dreams have the same effect.
 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.467
This is its allure,
the allure of literature,

00:03:09.467 --> 00:03:11.250
and also it's danger.
 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.537
We can live lives other than
ours full of adventures

00:03:16.537 --> 00:03:21.721
untrammeled by society's
constraints and by our own

00:03:21.721 --> 00:03:23.378
limitations.
 

00:03:23.378 --> 00:03:30.573
Does doing that purge us of
those desires or does it induce

00:03:30.573 --> 00:03:37.766
more desires and induce the
desire to close the gap between

00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:40.620
desire and reality?
 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.372
But the Quixote is also,
in addition,

00:03:44.372 --> 00:03:48.646
about the creation of
literature, the relationship

00:03:48.646 --> 00:03:53.794
each text has with previous
texts as well as about questions

00:03:53.794 --> 00:03:55.889
of literary genre.
 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.487
The Quixote appears at
the end of the Renaissance when

00:04:00.487 --> 00:04:04.473
improvements of the printing
press had created a mass

00:04:04.473 --> 00:04:06.479
readership,
so to speak,

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.275
mass readership,
nothing compared to what we

00:04:09.275 --> 00:04:12.110
have today,
a mass readership for the first

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.592
time in history,
and when the discovery,

00:04:15.592 --> 00:04:21.338
analysis and imitation of
classical treatises on poetics

00:04:21.338 --> 00:04:27.084
had brought to the fore
questions about content and form

00:04:27.084 --> 00:04:31.889
as well as of ethics,
public and private.

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.882
As you know,
the Renaissance humanists were

00:04:36.882 --> 00:04:42.007
interested in the Classics,
in reading the Classics in the

00:04:42.007 --> 00:04:47.038
original,
in editing the Classics to make

00:04:47.038 --> 00:04:49.339
them available.
 

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:53.660
What is secular literature good
for?

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.079
What is good literature?
 

00:04:56.079 --> 00:05:01.646
How do new ideas about reading
and writing effect the

00:05:01.646 --> 00:05:04.860
interpretation of scripture?
 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.081
Is secular literature in the
vernacular a danger to faith,

00:05:10.081 --> 00:05:11.730
religious faith?
 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.403
The Quixote is full of
writers and readers-- you will

00:05:15.403 --> 00:05:19.014
meet them as you read the book--
of books, stories,

00:05:19.014 --> 00:05:23.829
poems and of people young and
old effected by literature.

00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:31.370
You will meet some very early,
Marcela and Grisóstomo.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.940
Now, in this vain about Don
Quixote and the issue of

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:43.089
literature is the originality of
the Don Quixote story.

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:48.334
The fact that it does not
belong to any known tradition or

00:05:48.334 --> 00:05:53.209
cycle be it from the pastoral or
chivalric cycles,

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:57.839
not to mention popular
narratives or even mythology,

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:03.120
that is, Don Quixote is
not based on a classical myth or

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.699
a traditional story handed down
orally,

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.920
the Quixote is a new
story.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.560
Indeed, Cervantes boasts that
it is new.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.956
It is no small accomplishment
to set out to write a narrative

00:06:18.956 --> 00:06:23.648
without precedence,
to make an individual invention

00:06:23.648 --> 00:06:27.720
a fundamental factor of a
literary work.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.290
The Divine Comedy tells
an original story yet,

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.990
it is based on received popular
and cultural traditions,

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.940
the sense to hell,
a sense to heaven,

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.882
and it calls and incorporates
many stories from biblical and

00:06:43.882 --> 00:06:45.810
classical traditions.
 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.377
The Decameron by
Boccaccio--some of which you may

00:06:50.377 --> 00:06:54.860
have read it--retells tales
drawn from many popular and

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.019
cultural sources,
too.

00:06:57.019 --> 00:07:00.694
The same goes for,
of course, for the pastoral and

00:07:00.694 --> 00:07:05.269
the chivalric romances about
which I will be speaking soon.

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:09.699
But the story of a man who goes
mad because he reads too much

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:13.762
has only one known source and it
is so trifling as to be

00:07:13.762 --> 00:07:17.391
dismissed,
although, the fact that it

00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:20.300
exists is of some importance.
 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:26.213
The very act of invention on
Cervantes' part is an important

00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:29.319
modern component of the work.
 

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:35.970
Invention is the hallmark of
modern literature.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:41.067
Now, how could such a
revolutionary work appear in

00:07:41.067 --> 00:07:41.899
Spain?
 

00:07:41.899 --> 00:07:45.154
I'm sorry to make this
assumption but your conception

00:07:45.154 --> 00:07:48.660
of Spain cannot be but the
result of the Black Legend.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.839
What is the Black Legend?
 

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:55.459
The Black Legend is the bad
press that Spain's enemies

00:07:55.459 --> 00:08:00.341
disseminated beginning in the
sixteenth century about the

00:08:00.341 --> 00:08:05.660
mistreatment of the Indians and
about Spain's backwardness and

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.468
brutality,
and so forth,

00:08:08.468 --> 00:08:13.523
your images of the inquisition,
religious intolerance,

00:08:13.523 --> 00:08:17.910
a certain primitiveness and
backwardness...

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:24.120
This is all embedded in the
English language you cannot

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.500
escape it.
 

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:30.459
It is full of what we call
factoids, things that are almost

00:08:30.459 --> 00:08:34.392
true but not quite we call
factoids derisively,

00:08:34.392 --> 00:08:35.590
of course.
 

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:39.750
Yet, during the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries,

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.839
Spain produced Cervantes,
Velázquez,

00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:46.149
the character of Don Juan,
the picaresque,

00:08:46.149 --> 00:08:51.135
all figures authors or kinds of
writing that are at the core of

00:08:51.135 --> 00:08:53.629
the modern western tradition.
 

00:08:53.629 --> 00:08:56.649
How could that be so?
 

00:08:56.649 --> 00:09:01.394
The Quixote aided by
Elliot's Imperial Spain

00:09:01.394 --> 00:09:04.642
which you are,
I hope dutifully reading,

00:09:04.642 --> 00:09:08.554
will help dispel these
perceptions as well as my

00:09:08.554 --> 00:09:10.970
comments in the course.
 

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:15.761
Now, let me clarify as much as
possible the confusion about

00:09:15.761 --> 00:09:20.307
terms such as 'novel' and
'romance,' a confusion that is

00:09:20.307 --> 00:09:25.431
augmented by the fact that they
don't quite coincide with their

00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:27.580
cognates in Spanish.
 

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:33.080
Cognates are words in two
different languages that sound

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:38.879
the same but then sometimes are
not the same in meaning.

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:44.120
'Romance' is a term derived
from the name Rome,

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:49.299
of course, meaning that
originally these were works

00:09:49.299 --> 00:09:54.168
written in the languages derived
from Latin,

00:09:54.168 --> 00:09:56.317
that is French,
Spanish, Italian,

00:09:56.317 --> 00:09:59.908
Portuguese and so forth--
those are the important ones.

00:09:59.908 --> 00:10:04.308
Let us begin with the Webster's
definition for 'romance.'

00:10:04.308 --> 00:10:07.605
It says: "Originally,
a long narrative in verse or

00:10:07.605 --> 00:10:10.899
prose written in one of the
romantic dialects."

00:10:10.899 --> 00:10:13.804
It says in Webster's--Remember
what I said about language and

00:10:13.804 --> 00:10:14.288
dialect?
 

00:10:14.288 --> 00:10:17.320
A language is a dialect with an
army,

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.855
meaning that a people who speak
a certain dialect become

00:10:20.855 --> 00:10:24.840
powerful enough and impose it on
the rest of the population.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.578
So, "...
 

00:10:25.578 --> 00:10:28.875
originally written in one of
the romance dialects about the

00:10:28.875 --> 00:10:31.889
adventures of knights and other
chivalric heroes,

00:10:31.889 --> 00:10:36.244
to a fictitious tale dealing
not so much with every day life

00:10:36.244 --> 00:10:40.820
as with extraordinary adventures
or mysterious events."

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.029
That's the Webster's definition
of romance.

00:10:43.029 --> 00:10:47.389
A popular dictionary of
literary terms gives the

00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:51.945
following for romance,
"Romance a fictional story

00:10:51.945 --> 00:10:55.840
in verse or prose that relates
improbable adventures of

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:00.240
idealized characters in some
remote or enchanted setting,

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:06.688
or more generally a tendency in
fiction opposed to that of

00:11:06.688 --> 00:11:08.500
realism."
 

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.326
Now, etymologies are fun,
but they don't always clarify

00:11:12.326 --> 00:11:14.879
what a word means in the
present,

00:11:14.879 --> 00:11:18.750
and, in fact,
sometimes the etymologies work

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.538
against such a clarification.
 

00:11:21.538 --> 00:11:26.294
How many know or how useful is
it to know that candid,

00:11:26.294 --> 00:11:31.498
the word 'candid,' for example,
derives from the Latin word

00:11:31.498 --> 00:11:34.370
'candidus' for white?
 

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.340
It doesn't help you in the
present to know that at all.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.980
It helps you be pedantic if you
tell somebody,

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:44.696
or if you bring it up in that
party that I always mention

00:11:44.696 --> 00:11:47.053
here,
at which a Yalie can be

00:11:47.053 --> 00:11:50.758
pedantic by saying,
"Candid derives from

00:11:50.758 --> 00:11:54.922
candidus in Latin which
means white,"

00:11:54.922 --> 00:11:57.394
or,
"That is a very Kafkaesque

00:11:57.394 --> 00:11:59.379
story that you've told me."
 

00:11:59.379 --> 00:12:01.679
In any case,
in this case,

00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:07.202
knowing that the term 'romance'
derives from Rome and that it

00:12:07.202 --> 00:12:12.264
indicates that these stories
were written in the romance

00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:16.455
languages,
does provide a historical

00:12:16.455 --> 00:12:17.399
insight.
 

00:12:17.399 --> 00:12:22.721
Romances emerged after the
breakup of the Roman Empire

00:12:22.721 --> 00:12:28.245
during the Middle Ages as the
various national languages

00:12:28.245 --> 00:12:31.759
acquired individual identities.
 

00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:38.423
So we have now a historical
period that the etymology

00:12:38.423 --> 00:12:40.860
romance gives us.
 

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.179
So in English,
'romance' means a story with a

00:12:44.179 --> 00:12:47.200
linear plot and unchanging
characters.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.668
One episode follows another,
and the heroes and heroines

00:12:52.668 --> 00:12:54.460
remain the same.
 

00:12:54.460 --> 00:13:02.000
This is the reason romances of
chivalry are called 'romances.'

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.686
The romance form is preferred
by popular fiction and by works

00:13:06.686 --> 00:13:10.278
with an ideological and
doctrinaire purpose.

00:13:10.278 --> 00:13:14.210
They are easy to follow and
their moral is clear.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:17.534
Many cartoons,
for instance,

00:13:17.534 --> 00:13:21.969
have the form of a
romance--cartoons,

00:13:21.969 --> 00:13:23.940
comic books.
 

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.655
Novels, on the other hand,
are works in which there is a

00:13:28.655 --> 00:13:32.577
clash between the characters,
the protagonists and the

00:13:32.577 --> 00:13:37.601
settings in which they move--
remember the quotation from

00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:44.346
Lukach in my earlier lecture--
and in which the characters

00:13:44.346 --> 00:13:49.283
evolve as a result of the
actions in which they are

00:13:49.283 --> 00:13:50.470
involved.
 

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.485
Characters in the romances
don't change,

00:13:52.485 --> 00:13:54.399
they're always heroic and so
forth.

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:59.446
Characters in the novels do
change, evolve,

00:13:59.446 --> 00:14:02.330
because of the action.
 

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:08.923
Now, the Quixote is the
first such case of this clash

00:14:08.923 --> 00:14:13.730
between the protagonist and his
setting,

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:17.267
though an argument can be made
in favor of the picaresque,

00:14:17.267 --> 00:14:20.370
and a work that I'll be
mentioning today again--

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:24.318
I mentioned in it in the
class--La Celestina

00:14:24.318 --> 00:14:28.899
already has that clash between
protagonist and setting,

00:14:28.899 --> 00:14:31.389
and there is change and
characters evolve.

00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:38.259
But the Quixote is the
first case.

00:14:38.259 --> 00:14:42.727
Now, I think and I hope now we
have--I hope--a clear

00:14:42.727 --> 00:14:48.336
terminological between novel and
romance, and you will understand

00:14:48.336 --> 00:14:50.788
when I speak about them.
 

00:14:50.788 --> 00:14:55.081
Now, matters get confused when
we know that in English

00:14:55.081 --> 00:14:58.970
picaresque stories are often
called romances--

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:05.009
this is particularly among
English department types--

00:15:05.009 --> 00:15:09.610
while in Spanish we call them
'novelas,' novels.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.917
I will always refer to
picaresque tales as novels,

00:15:12.917 --> 00:15:15.955
because they are,
according to the definitions

00:15:15.955 --> 00:15:17.710
that I've given above.
 

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:22.551
Now, if you know Spanish,
you may be further confused by

00:15:22.551 --> 00:15:27.570
the fact that 'romance'
in Spanish is a ballad,

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:34.350
a narrative originally popular
poem, like the English ballads.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:38.830
So you must keep this
distinction clear in mind.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:42.567
If you happen to read something
in Spanish and you read

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:46.789
'romance,' it is not a
romance in the in the sense that

00:15:46.789 --> 00:15:49.490
I've been explaining,
it is a poem.

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:56.488
Now, what was it that Don
Quixote so avidly wanted to

00:15:56.488 --> 00:15:57.700
become?
 

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.845
Let me clarify,
too, what the chivalric

00:16:00.845 --> 00:16:04.488
romances were,
because this is something that

00:16:04.488 --> 00:16:08.543
is taken for granted,
everybody knows chivalric...

00:16:08.543 --> 00:16:09.288
No.
 

00:16:09.288 --> 00:16:12.716
Let us clarify,
I like to clarify things and to

00:16:12.716 --> 00:16:14.730
start from the ground up.
 

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:16.808
What is it that Don Quixote
wanted to become?

00:16:16.808 --> 00:16:22.580
What's this whole business of
the romances of chivalry?

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:27.957
First, as I did with the term
'romance' let me clarify the

00:16:27.957 --> 00:16:31.450
background of the word
'chivalric.'

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:36.533
Chivalric comes from the French
word 'cheval' or horse,

00:16:36.533 --> 00:16:40.619
and it reflects the fact that
the knight's form of

00:16:40.619 --> 00:16:43.370
transportation was the horse.
 

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.200
What does French have to do
with English?

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.830
Well, William the Conqueror,
the Battle of Hastings,

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:53.674
the invasion of England by the
French, and all of that which

00:16:53.674 --> 00:16:57.000
you learned in elementary school
or high school,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.524
and the fact that French is one
of these sources of modern

00:17:03.524 --> 00:17:04.670
English.
 

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:08.910
But the horse was more than
just a form of transportation.

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:14.073
It was an instrument of
warfare, a prized possession

00:17:14.073 --> 00:17:19.538
with each having a sonorous name
if at all possible.

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:25.140
The horse was part of the
knight's identity;

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.617
hence, the whole business about
naming his horse at the

00:17:28.617 --> 00:17:31.839
beginning of the
Quixote--now you understand

00:17:31.839 --> 00:17:32.420
that.
 

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:39.212
Part of the culture of horses
was a kind of courtesy,

00:17:39.212 --> 00:17:46.529
so we have in English also
'chivalrous,' for instance.

00:17:46.529 --> 00:17:50.923
Horses have always spawned a
whole culture of their own and

00:17:50.923 --> 00:17:55.392
have left a large imprint on
languages because they were the

00:17:55.392 --> 00:17:59.861
principle mode of transportation
until part of the twentieth

00:17:59.861 --> 00:18:02.210
century, you can imagine.
 

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:08.042
So technically,
etymologically 'chivalric

00:18:08.042 --> 00:18:15.336
romance' is a horse romance or,
more appropriately,

00:18:15.336 --> 00:18:19.420
romances about horsemen.
 

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:23.236
In Spanish the etymology is
clearer as the romances of

00:18:23.236 --> 00:18:26.115
chivalry are simply called
'novelas de

00:18:26.115 --> 00:18:30.364
caballerías' and
'caballo' is the word for

00:18:30.364 --> 00:18:32.019
horse in Spanish.
 

00:18:32.019 --> 00:18:35.397
Now, chivalric romances or in
Spanish 'novelas de

00:18:35.397 --> 00:18:39.506
caballerías' were the
popular literature of the late

00:18:39.506 --> 00:18:42.088
Middle Ages and early
Renaissance,

00:18:42.088 --> 00:18:46.835
whose dissemination was greatly
aided by the development of

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:47.490
print.
 

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:50.157
I'm talking about the
fourteenth and fifteenth

00:18:50.157 --> 00:18:50.868
centuries.
 

00:18:50.868 --> 00:18:54.632
The printing press as you no
doubt know was developed in the

00:18:54.632 --> 00:18:58.138
fifteenth century making
available to many readers books

00:18:58.138 --> 00:19:03.073
including the Bible,
which only a very few had

00:19:03.073 --> 00:19:04.808
access before.
 

00:19:04.808 --> 00:19:08.426
We have a copy of the
Guttenberg Bible in our

00:19:08.426 --> 00:19:11.972
own Beinecke Library,
if you want to go and look at

00:19:11.972 --> 00:19:12.470
it.
 

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:17.490
Now, this development of the
printing press had a decisive

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:22.690
impact on literature because it
increased dissemination,

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:26.250
on the Quixote and the
novel, in general,

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:29.278
owe their existence to this
invention.

00:19:29.278 --> 00:19:34.455
As we can see by the impact the
romances of chivalry had on our

00:19:34.455 --> 00:19:39.798
hero and the large number of
them that he had in his library,

00:19:39.798 --> 00:19:44.220
if you got to the chapter on
the scrutiny of the library.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:50.412
The romances of chivalry were
the first best sellers--They are

00:19:50.412 --> 00:19:56.705
entertaining and I encourage you
to read one or two if you have

00:19:56.705 --> 00:19:57.618
time.
 

00:19:57.618 --> 00:20:02.773
Now, the chivalric romances
originated in France and were

00:20:02.773 --> 00:20:07.192
derived from the roman
courtois or courtly

00:20:07.192 --> 00:20:10.185
romance--
roman courtois--In

00:20:10.185 --> 00:20:13.922
French, 'roman'
eventually became the name for

00:20:13.922 --> 00:20:18.088
'novel' but roman
courtois or courtly romance

00:20:18.088 --> 00:20:22.544
was a narrative in verse which
was the favorite of feudal lords

00:20:22.544 --> 00:20:26.711
no longer engaged in military
exploits who looked back with

00:20:26.711 --> 00:20:31.308
nostalgia to a heroic age the
same as Don Quixote will.

00:20:31.308 --> 00:20:34.867
The roman courtois took
its themes from classical

00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:37.470
legends,
such as the Trojan Wars,

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.700
or the exploits of Alexander
the Great,

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.482
even oriental tales,
but it preferred themes derived

00:20:44.482 --> 00:20:47.971
from Briton legends,
legends from Brittany,

00:20:47.971 --> 00:20:50.970
such as that of Tristan and
Isolde,

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:55.008
the knights in pursuit of the
Holy Grail, like Percifal and

00:20:55.008 --> 00:20:58.316
Merlin and Lancelot,
or Arthurian tales about

00:20:58.316 --> 00:21:01.730
Arthur, the real or imaginary
king of Britain,

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:05.166
and the Knights of the Round
Table-- You have heard about all

00:21:05.166 --> 00:21:05.740
of this.
 

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.907
All of these adventures take
place in a fantastic atmosphere

00:21:09.907 --> 00:21:13.368
shrouded in a very kind of
lyricist and poetry.

00:21:13.368 --> 00:21:17.361
When these roman
courtois--remember,

00:21:17.361 --> 00:21:22.968
in verse and so forth--were
turned into prose narratives the

00:21:22.968 --> 00:21:26.009
chivalric romances appeared.
 

00:21:26.009 --> 00:21:30.286
Each of these books had as a
hero a knight-errant that

00:21:30.286 --> 00:21:34.077
incarnated heroism,
amorous fidelity and was the

00:21:34.077 --> 00:21:37.710
defender of justice and of the
oppressed.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.608
The night was involved in the
most extraordinary adventures

00:21:41.608 --> 00:21:44.769
against fantastic and
frightening wrongdoers;

00:21:44.769 --> 00:21:48.226
his passionate love for an
idealized lady dominated his

00:21:48.226 --> 00:21:48.930
thoughts.
 

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:52.029
Love was a fundamental
component of these narratives.

00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:56.210
The knight would offer to his
lady the glory of his feats.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:59.959
This love for a lady is the
same as courtly love,

00:21:59.959 --> 00:22:04.099
which as you may know,
inspired the medieval lyric.

00:22:04.099 --> 00:22:08.720
 
 

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:15.760
And was a fashion involving all
sorts of rituals in the courts

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.068
of elegant ladies.
 

00:22:18.068 --> 00:22:23.997
It's too long a story to be
told, but think that the

00:22:23.997 --> 00:22:30.854
romances of chivalry are shot
through as it were the idea of

00:22:30.854 --> 00:22:32.828
courtly love.
 

00:22:32.828 --> 00:22:38.056
These were not just military
heroes, but they were also great

00:22:38.056 --> 00:22:38.838
lovers.
 

00:22:38.838 --> 00:22:43.015
In Spain, there were two
notable antecedents to the

00:22:43.015 --> 00:22:47.190
romances of chivalry in the
fourteenth century,

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.140
La Gran conquista de
ultramar,

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.066
El caballero Zifar,
but these should not concern

00:22:52.066 --> 00:22:52.500
you.
 

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:57.787
During the fourteenth century,
all of the European books of

00:22:57.787 --> 00:23:02.618
chivalry were disseminated in
Spain in adaptations and

00:23:02.618 --> 00:23:06.824
translations,
particularly those of the

00:23:06.824 --> 00:23:08.259
Breton cycle.
 

00:23:08.259 --> 00:23:11.866
The most significant chivalric
romance in terms of circulation

00:23:11.866 --> 00:23:15.179
and influence as well as impact
on the Quixote was

00:23:15.179 --> 00:23:19.962
Amadís de Gaula--
about which you will hear and

00:23:19.962 --> 00:23:23.519
read a lot throughout this
semester,

00:23:23.519 --> 00:23:33.630
because he is Don Quixote's
chief moral--

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:39.430
which it was written around
1492--that miraculous year when

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:45.353
so many things happened--
but was published in 1508 in

00:23:45.353 --> 00:23:46.618
Saragossa.
 

00:23:46.618 --> 00:23:49.667
It is known that there were
stories about Amadís

00:23:49.667 --> 00:23:53.000
circulating as far back as the
early fourteenth century,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.180
and Montalvo,
who was its author,

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:58.928
states in the prologue that he
took the story written by

00:23:58.928 --> 00:24:02.750
several authors,
divided it into four books and

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:06.732
recast it adding a few touches
and fifth book about

00:24:06.732 --> 00:24:10.078
Esplandián,
Amadís's son.

00:24:10.078 --> 00:24:15.028
These chivalric romances could
and did have many sequels,

00:24:15.028 --> 00:24:18.558
much like today's soap operas
on television,

00:24:18.558 --> 00:24:22.318
and responded to the same kind
of demand from the public.

00:24:22.318 --> 00:24:25.051
This couldn't end here,
we want more Amadís

00:24:25.051 --> 00:24:27.281
adventures, we want
Amadís's son's

00:24:27.281 --> 00:24:28.900
adventures, and so forth.
 

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:34.682
In fact, all popular fiction
from Sherlock Holmes to James

00:24:34.682 --> 00:24:38.538
Bond is sequential in this
fashion,

00:24:38.538 --> 00:24:41.721
which is the reason why soap
operas are derisively called

00:24:41.721 --> 00:24:45.354
Spanish culebrones,
from 'culebra,' snake,

00:24:45.354 --> 00:24:48.980
because it's a snake that goes
on, and on, and on...

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.588
And so this is the way that the
romances of chivalry,

00:24:52.588 --> 00:24:56.546
as you saw, if you read the
chapter on the scrutiny of the

00:24:56.546 --> 00:24:57.380
library.
 

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.863
The Amadís is a
very free adaptation of novels

00:25:00.863 --> 00:25:04.866
from the Breton cycle;
but is a complex network of the

00:25:04.866 --> 00:25:08.038
most varied and marvelous
adventures.

00:25:08.038 --> 00:25:12.160
It tells the story of his birth
virtually in the river,

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:16.368
because he's thrown in a river
as baby to hide his mother's sin

00:25:16.368 --> 00:25:19.247
because they were not married,
his parents,

00:25:19.247 --> 00:25:26.211
who were a king and a queen,
and he's rescued and trained as

00:25:26.211 --> 00:25:32.986
a knight in combat,
then he falls in love with

00:25:32.986 --> 00:25:37.450
Oriana, Oriana becomes his
beloved,

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:42.683
so Amadís and Oriana is
one of the great couples of

00:25:42.683 --> 00:25:44.430
literary history.
 

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:50.376
He is put through all kinds of
trials and he's enchanted and

00:25:50.376 --> 00:25:55.030
disenchanted,
and he is a most loyal and

00:25:55.030 --> 00:26:02.519
faithful of lovers against all
temptations from various ladies.

00:26:02.519 --> 00:26:09.459
In fact, he is forced to go
through the arch of faithful

00:26:09.459 --> 00:26:16.525
lovers which could only be
crossed by lovers who had been

00:26:16.525 --> 00:26:22.444
absolutely faithful--
How many people can go through

00:26:22.444 --> 00:26:24.288
it?-- and so forth.
 

00:26:24.288 --> 00:26:27.376
This is what is in Don
Quixote's imagination and

00:26:27.376 --> 00:26:32.175
desires,
this figure of this invincible

00:26:32.175 --> 00:26:37.338
hero who is noble and a great
lover,

00:26:37.338 --> 00:26:43.615
and this book was so important
in the sixteenth century that it

00:26:43.615 --> 00:26:46.450
acquired a didactic value.
 

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:53.730
I mean, it was used as a novel
for deportment and for courtesy,

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:57.662
even more so,
it surpassed the model for

00:26:57.662 --> 00:27:02.905
courtly behavior which was
written by a great Italian

00:27:02.905 --> 00:27:06.940
writer called Baltasare
Castiglione.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:11.404
Castiglione is one of several
important Renaissance figures

00:27:11.404 --> 00:27:14.868
that you're going to be hearing
about here.

00:27:14.868 --> 00:27:20.815
His last name is written like
this, and his book is called

00:27:20.815 --> 00:27:26.240
the Courtesan and it was
published in 1528.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.058
It was a very important book.
 

00:27:29.058 --> 00:27:32.528
But the Amadís
was much more fun to read,

00:27:32.528 --> 00:27:38.647
and therefore it surpassed
Castiglione's book as a source

00:27:38.647 --> 00:27:44.328
of models for deportment for
people in the courts.

00:27:44.328 --> 00:27:47.785
So it is for all of these
reasons that the

00:27:47.785 --> 00:27:51.240
Amadís achieved great
success,

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:55.957
among the greatest in Spanish
literature and many expressed

00:27:55.957 --> 00:28:00.185
their admiration for it
including great political and

00:28:00.185 --> 00:28:02.220
intellectual figures.
 

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.159
It was for the reader's of the
time the only possibility for

00:28:06.159 --> 00:28:09.028
evasion, the only food for their
fantasy.

00:28:09.028 --> 00:28:12.531
The romances of chivalry were
in the sixteenth century what

00:28:12.531 --> 00:28:15.368
movies and television shows are
for us today.

00:28:15.368 --> 00:28:18.346
But the romances and
Amadís,

00:28:18.346 --> 00:28:21.180
in particular,
had their detractors--

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.818
spoilsports are everywhere all
of the time--

00:28:23.818 --> 00:28:28.490
who saw in such books a threat
to public morals.

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:32.498
They became a topic of debate,
and this is behind the role

00:28:32.498 --> 00:28:36.365
Amadís plays in
the Quixote and the

00:28:36.365 --> 00:28:40.586
reason why Cervantes says that
he is writing his book against

00:28:40.586 --> 00:28:43.757
them,
to make fun of them in such a

00:28:43.757 --> 00:28:47.450
way that people would not read
them any more.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:51.473
He's entering,
supposedly, the debate about

00:28:51.473 --> 00:28:56.838
the value or lack thereof of the
romances of chivalry.

00:28:56.838 --> 00:29:00.468
So now, I hope,
you have a clearer idea of what

00:29:00.468 --> 00:29:03.859
it was that Don Quixote wanted
to become.

00:29:03.859 --> 00:29:05.619
So it's not vague what he wants.
 

00:29:05.619 --> 00:29:08.430
It's clearly and concrete.
 

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:13.893
I suppose at modern day Don
Quixote would like to be James

00:29:13.893 --> 00:29:19.548
Bond because we have to assume a
modern Alonso Quixano to be

00:29:19.548 --> 00:29:25.587
middle aged and to have grown up
with James Bond as the image of

00:29:25.587 --> 00:29:26.930
heroism.
 

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:32.741
I read that Senator Kennedy in
the last hours of his life or

00:29:32.741 --> 00:29:37.568
days would watch Bond movies for
entertainment.

00:29:37.568 --> 00:29:42.488
Obviously, for a man of his
age, James Bond was the acme of

00:29:42.488 --> 00:29:45.371
heroism and debonair,
good looking,

00:29:45.371 --> 00:29:49.950
all the women fall for him and
that sort of thing.

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:54.451
So, I guess maybe your parents
or your grandparents,

00:29:54.451 --> 00:29:58.156
not you, if you wanted to
become a Quixote,

00:29:58.156 --> 00:30:01.598
they would want to be a James
Bond.

00:30:01.598 --> 00:30:06.612
Now, Amadís was
the most obvious and avowed by

00:30:06.612 --> 00:30:11.368
Cervantes precursor of the
Quixote in Spanish,

00:30:11.368 --> 00:30:18.480
but what were Cervantes's
predecessors among more serious

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.528
Spanish literary work?
 

00:30:21.528 --> 00:30:27.046
Which were the Spanish works
that Cervantes had read,

00:30:27.046 --> 00:30:33.200
absorbed and incorporated into
his own literary project?

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.968
I have mentioned some of these,
I want to mention them again

00:30:36.968 --> 00:30:40.864
because I want to lay the ground
work in the most thorough way

00:30:40.864 --> 00:30:42.779
possible so that you know.
 

00:30:42.779 --> 00:30:46.636
The first was La
Celestina,

00:30:46.636 --> 00:30:51.078
which I mentioned in the last
class.

00:30:51.078 --> 00:30:56.443
It has several titles,
but I think I'll settle for La

00:30:56.443 --> 00:31:02.838
Celestina, which is from 1499,
written by Fernando de Rojas.

00:31:02.838 --> 00:31:06.487
It is of indeterminate genre,
the closest description would

00:31:06.487 --> 00:31:08.058
be a dramatic dialogue.
 

00:31:08.058 --> 00:31:12.402
La Celestina is the most
significant precursor to

00:31:12.402 --> 00:31:13.348
Cervantes.
 

00:31:13.348 --> 00:31:16.028
It is a tragic story of two
young lovers,

00:31:16.028 --> 00:31:18.990
Calixto and Melibea,
who consummate their love under

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:24.058
the guidance of a go-between,
the protagonist Celestina.

00:31:24.058 --> 00:31:29.406
Celestina is an old whore,
madam of a whore house and a

00:31:29.406 --> 00:31:30.200
witch.
 

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.076
But in spite of these unsavory
characteristics she is the

00:31:34.076 --> 00:31:35.598
heroine of the work.
 

00:31:35.598 --> 00:31:39.383
This is the most original
aspect of this work,

00:31:39.383 --> 00:31:44.429
that the protagonist is an old
whore, go between witch and so

00:31:44.429 --> 00:31:45.269
forth.
 

00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:50.932
Still, she is the heroine in
the sense that she is willful

00:31:50.932 --> 00:31:54.308
and goes against fate,
and that.

00:31:54.308 --> 00:31:58.847
Now, there is a clear clash
between neo-Platonic notions of

00:31:58.847 --> 00:32:03.777
love typical of the Renaissance
and the courtly division and the

00:32:03.777 --> 00:32:07.689
sordid and cynical view of
humankind and of love in

00:32:07.689 --> 00:32:09.019
particular.
 

00:32:09.019 --> 00:32:15.056
Celestina controls the whole
city because she controls

00:32:15.056 --> 00:32:18.358
people's erotic adventures.
 

00:32:18.358 --> 00:32:20.710
There are two worlds that of
Celestina,

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:24.125
the servants and whores,
and that of the lovers Calisto

00:32:24.125 --> 00:32:27.730
and Melibea and Melibea's
parents which are the gentry.

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:30.720
So there is also a class clash
here.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.847
Calixto is a Quixote in the
making because he wants to play

00:32:33.847 --> 00:32:35.788
act the role of the courtly
lover.

00:32:35.788 --> 00:32:41.502
He is killed when he falls off
a wall, the wall of Melibea's

00:32:41.502 --> 00:32:45.279
where he has been making love to
her.

00:32:45.279 --> 00:32:49.151
Melibea commits suicide and
Celestina is murdered by the

00:32:49.151 --> 00:32:51.826
servants because she has
swindled them,

00:32:51.826 --> 00:32:52.390
too.
 

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:57.019
Celestina is a pitiless book
with what can all ready be

00:32:57.019 --> 00:33:01.904
called a realistic quality,
and I'll talk about realism in

00:33:01.904 --> 00:33:03.019
a minute.
 

00:33:03.019 --> 00:33:07.413
The second important work
is--the other one that I

00:33:07.413 --> 00:33:13.717
mentioned,
but I want to now mention more

00:33:13.717 --> 00:33:21.935
clearly-- La vida del
Lazarillo de Tormes.

00:33:21.935 --> 00:33:28.690
Lazarillo de Tormes,
this is the first

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:30.413
picaresque novel.
 

00:33:30.413 --> 00:33:32.240
No known author.
 

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:37.391
It is the life told to a judge,
as in a deposition,

00:33:37.391 --> 00:33:42.750
by a petty criminal to justify
his current status.

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:45.569
He, at the end,
from the perspective that he

00:33:45.569 --> 00:33:48.848
writes, is married to the
archpriest's mistress.

00:33:48.848 --> 00:33:52.467
So he is a front,
he is a cuckolded husband who

00:33:52.467 --> 00:33:55.769
is compliant with society's
hypocrisies.

00:33:55.769 --> 00:33:59.301
Lazarillo tells his life from
birth to the present when he

00:33:59.301 --> 00:33:59.858
writes.
 

00:33:59.858 --> 00:34:02.895
This is life as seen from the
perspective of a low class

00:34:02.895 --> 00:34:05.778
individual,
a criminal who learned his

00:34:05.778 --> 00:34:09.672
tricks from his first master who
was, ironically,

00:34:09.672 --> 00:34:10.889
a blind man.
 

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:13.766
Guzmán de
Alfarache,

00:34:13.766 --> 00:34:18.646
I won't give you the whole
title, but this is good enough

00:34:18.646 --> 00:34:23.789
because this is how it is known
is the second most important

00:34:23.789 --> 00:34:27.800
picaresque novel that I want to
mention.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:37.597
Lazarillo is 1554,1599
for Guzmán de

00:34:37.597 --> 00:34:39.860
Alfarache.
 

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:43.286
It's a four-part prolix
tale of a criminal told in the

00:34:43.286 --> 00:34:45.802
first person,
also following the formula of

00:34:45.802 --> 00:34:49.117
Lazarillo,
but the difference is that here

00:34:49.117 --> 00:34:52.896
the life is told after a
religious conversion to the

00:34:52.896 --> 00:34:53.489
good.
 

00:34:53.489 --> 00:34:56.634
So the story of Guzmán's
life is laced with sermons about

00:34:56.634 --> 00:34:59.329
where he went wrong and ways to
improve his morals,

00:34:59.329 --> 00:35:03.248
but this retrospective
moralizing is always tempered by

00:35:03.248 --> 00:35:06.079
the appeal of the stories about
sin--

00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:10.161
sin is more interesting,
always--Guzmán became

00:35:10.161 --> 00:35:14.242
the model picaresque in
Cervantes' time and there are

00:35:14.242 --> 00:35:18.010
clear allusions to it in the
Quixote.

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:21.708
This is so you can see the
genealogy within the Spanish

00:35:21.708 --> 00:35:22.530
tradition.
 

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:27.949
Now, what these works show is
the emergence and development of

00:35:27.949 --> 00:35:32.418
realism as we know it,
and which would be continued in

00:35:32.418 --> 00:35:35.391
the work of Cervantes,
particularly the

00:35:35.391 --> 00:35:36.480
Quixote.
 

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.626
And lead all the way through to
the seventeenth and eighteenth

00:35:39.626 --> 00:35:41.690
century and nineteenth century
novels.

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:45.059
I mean, this is the beginning
of realism.

00:35:45.059 --> 00:35:47.775
Its emergence,
in my view, has a great deal to

00:35:47.775 --> 00:35:51.760
do with the Catholic Kings about
whom you're reading in Elliot,

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:57.869
the formation of a new modern
state with a large bureaucracy

00:35:57.869 --> 00:36:04.289
and a very large also,
penal, not only penal code,

00:36:04.289 --> 00:36:11.380
but penal institutions to
punish these criminals.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:15.512
A Spanish criminologist called
Rafael Salillas,

00:36:15.512 --> 00:36:20.454
in the nineteenth century,
links the picaresque with the

00:36:20.454 --> 00:36:23.420
birth of the social sciences.
 

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.760
He thinks that in the
picaresque and in this kind of

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.295
novel we have the beginnings of
the study of society as

00:36:30.295 --> 00:36:33.655
criminology,
sociology and so forth would

00:36:33.655 --> 00:36:37.909
study it in later centuries,
but this is the origin.

00:36:37.909 --> 00:36:43.324
Here, in this work,
there is a search for truth

00:36:43.324 --> 00:36:50.858
about human nature in the social
commerce of people of the lowest

00:36:50.858 --> 00:36:55.617
possible levels,
where civilization,

00:36:55.617 --> 00:36:59.469
as it were, has barely reached.
 

00:36:59.469 --> 00:37:03.728
There is an emphasis on the
material and the sordid in these

00:37:03.728 --> 00:37:07.771
works against neo-Platonic
conceptions of human kind that

00:37:07.771 --> 00:37:10.659
are more typical of the
Renaissance.

00:37:10.659 --> 00:37:15.335
The sordid, the ugly,
the dirty becomes esthetically

00:37:15.335 --> 00:37:20.010
valuable and appealing in these
realistic works,

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:25.340
in the behavior of the
characters, their actions,

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:31.210
and also their attitudes.
 

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:35.476
The point is that this sort of
probe into the social is an

00:37:35.476 --> 00:37:40.266
attempt to uncover a truth about
the human no longer available in

00:37:40.266 --> 00:37:44.382
the ancient classical literature
or its imitators in the

00:37:44.382 --> 00:37:45.730
Renaissance.
 

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:51.710
It goes against that kind of
version of the human.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:54.514
This is too complicated,
but I will get to it as the

00:37:54.514 --> 00:37:55.559
semester evolves.
 

00:37:55.559 --> 00:37:59.998
It is a rejection parallel to
that of Descartes as he

00:37:59.998 --> 00:38:05.036
formulates the philosophy of the
self when he sort of erases

00:38:05.036 --> 00:38:07.000
received tradition.
 

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.869
But I will leave that.
 

00:38:09.869 --> 00:38:13.038
I'll put that in the backburner
and we will get to it

00:38:13.038 --> 00:38:13.829
eventually.
 

00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:19.034
In realism, common objects--you
will see common objects in

00:38:19.034 --> 00:38:22.780
the Quixote --appear
frequently.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:25.061
This begins with
Celestina,

00:38:25.061 --> 00:38:28.934
but it's the world mostly of
the picaresque through which

00:38:28.934 --> 00:38:31.010
Don Quixote passes.
 

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:35.436
The character's accessories are
what endowed the description of

00:38:35.436 --> 00:38:38.150
this world with an aura of
reality,

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:44.110
what it is, what they
have--Sancho's wine skin,

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:47.869
for instance,
and so forth.

00:38:47.869 --> 00:38:50.831
Let us look for such common
objects.

00:38:50.831 --> 00:38:56.077
As you read the Quixote
you will see there is a focus on

00:38:56.077 --> 00:38:56.840
them.
 

00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.909
This is a parallel to a
development in painting which

00:39:00.909 --> 00:39:04.275
began with the work of Leo
Battista Alberti,

00:39:04.275 --> 00:39:05.920
known as Alberti.
 

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.811
I'll just do this in passing,
but I will allude to it more

00:39:10.811 --> 00:39:12.699
during the semester.
 

00:39:12.699 --> 00:39:21.860
He wrote a treatise called
De Pictura.

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:26.414
In very simplistic terms,
what Alberti nearly invented

00:39:26.414 --> 00:39:29.079
was the sense of perspective.
 

00:39:29.079 --> 00:39:36.018
That is, that objects appear in
different sizes depending on

00:39:36.018 --> 00:39:42.840
where they are in reference to a
point de fuite,

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.268
punto de fuga,
vanishing point in English--

00:39:45.268 --> 00:39:49.389
It will come to me--So you
understand objects,

00:39:49.389 --> 00:39:54.623
according to Alberti,
are to appear in painting not

00:39:54.623 --> 00:40:01.114
flat as they appear in medieval
painting but in relation to how

00:40:01.114 --> 00:40:05.981
they appear to the observer,
and how they are arranged

00:40:05.981 --> 00:40:07.449
according to perspective.
 

00:40:07.449 --> 00:40:11.157
Hence objects appear now in all
of their fullness,

00:40:11.157 --> 00:40:15.092
in all of their roundness,
in all of their weight and

00:40:15.092 --> 00:40:16.000
measure.
 

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.340
This is a form of realism that
begins in painting.

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:23.730
De Pictura is from 1435,
fifteenth century.

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:29.364
Alberti had an enormous
influence on the history of

00:40:29.364 --> 00:40:33.309
painting, but on philosophy,
too.

00:40:33.309 --> 00:40:37.840
I mean, this was a way of
conceiving the perception of

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:42.713
objects, also subject to time
because perspective in space

00:40:42.713 --> 00:40:45.619
involves also a sense of time.
 

00:40:45.619 --> 00:40:48.389
If something is back here and
something is here,

00:40:48.389 --> 00:40:50.983
this is closer,
I can get to it faster than I

00:40:50.983 --> 00:40:53.989
can get to that,
if you understand what I mean.

00:40:53.989 --> 00:40:59.360
Now, if you have seen
Velázquez paintings,

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:03.885
I'm sure some of you have,
you will remember how those

00:41:03.885 --> 00:41:07.813
objects that are just common
every day objects,

00:41:07.813 --> 00:41:10.289
suddenly have a fullness.
 

00:41:10.289 --> 00:41:14.085
Now, this is what will appear
in these novels,

00:41:14.085 --> 00:41:17.882
in the Quixote,
and this is part of the

00:41:17.882 --> 00:41:20.159
development of realism.
 

00:41:20.159 --> 00:41:25.159
Now, you will see that this is
a cliché

00:41:25.159 --> 00:41:30.268
about Spanish literature of the
Golden Age,

00:41:30.268 --> 00:41:33.916
sixteenth and seventeenth
century, what will prevail is a

00:41:33.916 --> 00:41:37.500
clash between this realistic
conception or vision of the

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:40.952
world and the idealistic
conception that comes through

00:41:40.952 --> 00:41:44.208
the neo-Platonic tradition and
that is, let us say,

00:41:44.208 --> 00:41:46.750
embodied in Don Quixote.
 

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:50.425
Don Quixote is an idealist
perspective and Sancho is the

00:41:50.425 --> 00:41:52.030
realistic perspective.
 

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:54.797
Sancho is close to the
material, to the world,

00:41:54.797 --> 00:41:57.998
material that he wants to eat
if he can possibly can,

00:41:57.998 --> 00:42:00.090
while Don Quixote doesn't eat.
 

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:02.500
He doesn't need to eat,
he lives in the world of ideas.

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.969
But, of course,
they influence each other.

00:42:04.969 --> 00:42:08.028
As you will see,
this is one of the great things

00:42:08.028 --> 00:42:11.478
about this novel that these
character's influence each

00:42:11.478 --> 00:42:12.130
other.
 

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:16.222
So we could say that that is
overall the overarching class in

00:42:16.222 --> 00:42:18.679
these works of Spanish
literature.

00:42:18.679 --> 00:42:22.782
But keep in mind above all what
I said about realism,

00:42:22.782 --> 00:42:27.278
because realism will be one of
the triumphs of Cervantes's

00:42:27.278 --> 00:42:27.989
work.
 

00:42:27.989 --> 00:42:32.460
Now, let us finally turn to
the Quixote.

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:37.335
I assume and I hope that you
have read at least the first few

00:42:37.335 --> 00:42:39.677
chapters,
and that by the next lecture

00:42:39.677 --> 00:42:41.780
you will have read the first 10
chapters,

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:44.748
as well as the assigned
readings in the Casebook

00:42:44.748 --> 00:42:48.264
which will give you a background
on Cervantes's life that I'm not

00:42:48.264 --> 00:42:52.476
giving you here,
as well as other materials and,

00:42:52.476 --> 00:42:56.420
of course, the first chapter in
Elliot.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.579
Now, the prologue.
 

00:42:58.579 --> 00:43:01.503
The prologue,
this 1605 prologue is one of

00:43:01.503 --> 00:43:05.782
the most important and famous
texts in Spanish literature and

00:43:05.782 --> 00:43:09.275
prologues are very important
always for Cervantes.

00:43:09.275 --> 00:43:09.989
Why?
 

00:43:09.989 --> 00:43:13.492
Because of his concern about
the relationship between creator

00:43:13.492 --> 00:43:16.077
and his creation,
and his concern about the

00:43:16.077 --> 00:43:18.369
nature of the self,
his own self,

00:43:18.369 --> 00:43:22.010
which is a very Renaissance
preoccupation.

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:26.110
Cervantes prologues are very
much like Montaigne's

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:30.210
Essays--Now,
I've mentioned Castiglione.

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:33.159
Now, I mention Montaigne.
 

00:43:33.159 --> 00:43:36.599
These are great Renaissance
figures that in the context of

00:43:36.599 --> 00:43:40.340
which Cervantes wrote and you
have to remember Castiglione,

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:45.655
Montaigne--,
and it is here that Cervantes

00:43:45.655 --> 00:43:53.693
introduces one of his favorite
tropes one that runs through the

00:43:53.693 --> 00:43:58.750
whole of the Quixote:
irony.

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:06.378
This is a very ironic prologue
which is conveyed through a very

00:44:06.378 --> 00:44:12.530
seductive kind of self
deprecation in Cervantes.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:16.110
'Desocupado lector' it begins,
"Idle reader,

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:18.675
"Jarvis mistranslates this
as 'gentle reader' in your

00:44:18.675 --> 00:44:22.322
translation,
but it is "Desocupado

00:44:22.322 --> 00:44:25.409
lector,"
idle reader.

00:44:25.409 --> 00:44:28.432
Cervantes assumes a reader who
comes to his book for

00:44:28.432 --> 00:44:30.211
entertainment,
not instruction,

00:44:30.211 --> 00:44:32.880
and who reads for pleasure,
not for work.

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:36.043
This is a novelty,
and a kind of challenge in a

00:44:36.043 --> 00:44:39.757
period when the function of
literature was very much an

00:44:39.757 --> 00:44:43.539
issue discussed by secular and
religious moralists.

00:44:43.539 --> 00:44:47.637
But we soon see that what
Cervantes means by entertainment

00:44:47.637 --> 00:44:51.951
does not preclude consideration
of very thorny ethical issues

00:44:51.951 --> 00:44:55.690
that involve reading and
literature in general,

00:44:55.690 --> 00:45:00.849
these issues emerge immediately
in the prologue.

00:45:00.849 --> 00:45:05.030
It is typical of Cervantes--and
you can expect to see it in the

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:08.538
rest of the work--to deal
lightly and humorously with

00:45:08.538 --> 00:45:09.820
weighty issues.
 

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:11.840
This is one of his constants.
 

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:17.085
He's able to deal with very
grave issues in a very light and

00:45:17.085 --> 00:45:18.420
humorous way.
 

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.130
That is his perspective.
 

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:22.768
It's part of his ironic
perspective.

00:45:22.768 --> 00:45:26.402
Now, the prologue,
although it comes first,

00:45:26.402 --> 00:45:28.480
is a kind of epilogue.
 

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:32.768
It was written obviously after
he finished the book.

00:45:32.768 --> 00:45:36.898
You cannot take for granted the
sequential order of things as

00:45:36.898 --> 00:45:39.514
you read them,
they are sequential in a

00:45:39.514 --> 00:45:40.960
conventional way.
 

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:42.976
It doesn't mean the prologue
that Cervantes sat down,

00:45:42.976 --> 00:45:44.800
wrote the prologue,
and then wrote the novel.

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:49.661
He wrote the novel,
and then wrote the prologue to

00:45:49.661 --> 00:45:53.730
ponder about what he had just
finished.

00:45:53.730 --> 00:46:01.498
Now, there is in the prologue a
tone, a prevailing theme of

00:46:01.498 --> 00:46:07.659
doubt which is,
again, an echo of Montaigne.

00:46:07.659 --> 00:46:11.737
Now, perhaps this explains the
self deprecating statements

00:46:11.737 --> 00:46:15.099
about his own creation and
inventive powers,

00:46:15.099 --> 00:46:17.684
that they're weak and that what
else could he produce and so

00:46:17.684 --> 00:46:19.949
forth,
at the very first paragraph

00:46:19.949 --> 00:46:21.889
where he belittles himself.
 

00:46:21.889 --> 00:46:25.914
It is very much like Montaigne
because Montaigne's stance is

00:46:25.914 --> 00:46:26.869
very modern.
 

00:46:26.869 --> 00:46:30.175
Montaigne writes with the
resignation of knowing that he

00:46:30.175 --> 00:46:32.099
will never outdo the Classics.
 

00:46:32.099 --> 00:46:37.536
By the way, there is a very
instructive piece on Montaigne

00:46:37.536 --> 00:46:40.780
in the latest New Yorker!
 

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:48.443
I mean Montaigne is still very
relevant and speaks to the

00:46:48.443 --> 00:46:50.360
modern mind.
 

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:53.222
He writes with the resignation
of knowing that he will never

00:46:53.222 --> 00:46:55.824
outdo the Classics,
that he will never really know

00:46:55.824 --> 00:46:58.389
the truth,
even about himself and that

00:46:58.389 --> 00:47:01.280
received knowledge is of dubious
value.

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.648
For instance,
in his famous essay called

00:47:03.648 --> 00:47:06.623
"On Cannibals"
he asks what business the

00:47:06.623 --> 00:47:10.389
Europeans have in imposing their
religious doctrines on natives

00:47:10.389 --> 00:47:13.851
of the New World who had been
getting along just fine with

00:47:13.851 --> 00:47:15.429
their own beliefs.
 

00:47:15.429 --> 00:47:18.679
And he says that it is worse to
roast people alive,

00:47:18.679 --> 00:47:23.570
as Europeans do to torture
them, than to roast them once

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:28.253
they're dead and eat them--
And, of course,

00:47:28.253 --> 00:47:31.480
he's right about that.
 

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:35.329
He's a relativist in a
post-Copernican world in which--

00:47:35.329 --> 00:47:38.414
I'm still talking about
Montaigne--in which we know that

00:47:38.414 --> 00:47:41.050
the earth is not the center of
the universe,

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:44.369
and hence human kind is not at
the center either in the way

00:47:44.369 --> 00:47:46.429
that it was believed to be
before.

00:47:46.429 --> 00:47:49.440
In his prologue,
Cervantes sounds very much like

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:52.001
Montaigne who,
if he was not a source was

00:47:52.001 --> 00:47:53.860
clearly a kindred spirit.
 

00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:57.349
They were both Hamlet like in
their display of doubt.

00:47:57.349 --> 00:48:02.289
Of course, Shakespeare had read
Montaigne.

00:48:02.289 --> 00:48:05.380
Now, who is this friend who
suddenly appears in the

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:06.059
prologue?
 

00:48:06.059 --> 00:48:10.737
Of course, it's a made up
friend, it's an imaginary friend

00:48:10.737 --> 00:48:15.498
that Cervantes events and to
turn the prologue into a story

00:48:15.498 --> 00:48:20.340
in which he's going to discuss
how to write a prologue while

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:24.952
writing the prologue,
and that is the whole joke

00:48:24.952 --> 00:48:26.110
behind this.
 

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:29.940
It's a big joke.
 

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:34.731
Cervantes was fond both of
telling stories rather than

00:48:34.731 --> 00:48:38.440
expounding on doctrine and of
dialogue.

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.659
He loved dialogue.
 

00:48:40.659 --> 00:48:44.159
Of having a topic discussed
from various points of view,

00:48:44.159 --> 00:48:46.539
this will be throughout the
whole of the Quixote,

00:48:46.539 --> 00:48:48.369
and we have it all ready in the
prologue.

00:48:48.369 --> 00:48:51.030
He has a dialogue with this
imaginary friend.

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:53.510
He's having a dialogue with
himself and has created this,

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:58.329
as we do occasionally,
creating an imaginary friend or

00:48:58.329 --> 00:49:03.606
someone with whom we speak which
is just another version of

00:49:03.606 --> 00:49:04.880
ourselves.
 

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:07.059
Different points of view.
 

00:49:07.059 --> 00:49:10.476
Cervantes likes things that are
being discussed from different

00:49:10.476 --> 00:49:12.380
points of view,
as you will see.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:16.579
Now, the main topic of the
prologue is the genesis and

00:49:16.579 --> 00:49:21.864
intention of the book,
a common topic for prologues

00:49:21.864 --> 00:49:28.826
only that here it is told as the
issue of how to prologue is

00:49:28.826 --> 00:49:30.360
discussed.
 

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.972
Now, there is an apparent
contradiction here at the

00:49:32.972 --> 00:49:33.599
beginning.
 

00:49:33.599 --> 00:49:36.532
Cervantes says this book could
be other like myself,

00:49:36.532 --> 00:49:37.969
because I'm his father.
 

00:49:37.969 --> 00:49:40.952
Then he says,
no I'm the stepfather by which

00:49:40.952 --> 00:49:45.182
he means that he's merely the
transcriber of this book by Cide

00:49:45.182 --> 00:49:49.815
Hamete Benengeli,
this fictitious Moorish author

00:49:49.815 --> 00:49:54.369
about whom you will hear a lot
in the book.

00:49:54.369 --> 00:49:59.340
This is the first of many
disclaimers of authorship in

00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:01.309
the Quixote.
 

00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:05.349
What Cervantes is probing here
is the genesis of literature,

00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:10.329
the genealogy of invention
which can no longer be taken for

00:50:10.329 --> 00:50:15.139
granted as following the rules
of Renaissance poetics.

00:50:15.139 --> 00:50:19.380
In what way does a book belong
to its author?

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:23.525
This is why Cervantes mocks the
usual front matter of other

00:50:23.525 --> 00:50:25.878
books,
in which authors boast of their

00:50:25.878 --> 00:50:29.021
erudition and ask others to
attest to the quality of their

00:50:29.021 --> 00:50:29.849
productions.
 

00:50:29.849 --> 00:50:32.235
The whole business that he's
talking about all of these

00:50:32.235 --> 00:50:35.150
sonnets that he could have asked
other people to write for him,

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:38.635
and so forth--By the way,
those sonnets exist in the book

00:50:38.635 --> 00:50:41.000
and are left out of the
translation.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.108
The front matter in a book is
everything from the title all

00:50:44.108 --> 00:50:46.199
the way to the beginning of the
book;

00:50:46.199 --> 00:50:48.050
prologue, preface,
acknowledgement.

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:51.208
This is called the front
matter, 'los

00:50:51.208 --> 00:50:55.827
preliminares' in Spanish,
if you want to learn that in

00:50:55.827 --> 00:50:56.800
Spanish.
 

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.972
These sonnets about the book,
in praise of the book,

00:50:59.972 --> 00:51:01.590
are like today's blurbs.
 

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:05.239
You pick up a book and you find
that there are blurbs.

00:51:05.239 --> 00:51:07.806
"Roberto González
Echevarría says...

00:51:07.806 --> 00:51:09.849
blah, blah,"
and there is a praise,

00:51:09.849 --> 00:51:14.577
and what has happened is that
the person blurbing the book has

00:51:14.577 --> 00:51:19.460
been one of the readers of the
press to accept another book,

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:23.016
and then they ask you to
excerpt something from your

00:51:23.016 --> 00:51:25.250
report and put it on the back.
 

00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:27.797
Other times,
they just send you the book and

00:51:27.797 --> 00:51:30.463
say, "Please,
would you write a blurb for

00:51:30.463 --> 00:51:31.650
this book?"
 

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:34.275
I know many people who do it
without reading the book,

00:51:34.275 --> 00:51:36.753
"Oh, one of the
greatest..."and they just

00:51:36.753 --> 00:51:37.050
write.
 

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:38.389
So it's the same here.
 

00:51:38.389 --> 00:51:42.579
This is what Cervantes is
mocking, but what he does is,

00:51:42.579 --> 00:51:46.070
instead of going outside for
legitimation,

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:50.967
he has literary characters
write the sonnets in praise of

00:51:50.967 --> 00:51:51.929
his book.
 

00:51:51.929 --> 00:51:57.126
It's as if I wrote a book and I
had a blurb from James Bond to

00:51:57.126 --> 00:52:00.619
continue with our fictional
characters.

00:52:00.619 --> 00:52:04.489
What he's doing is showing that
literature is self legitimating.

00:52:04.489 --> 00:52:06.634
He is not going outside of
fiction and outside of

00:52:06.634 --> 00:52:11.487
literature for legitimation,
but he's using these literary

00:52:11.487 --> 00:52:16.750
characters to be those who
praise the book.

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:21.280
It's another game,
another joke that he is playing

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:22.760
on the reader.
 

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:27.800
So what does the friend tell
him to do?

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:32.251
The friend tells him to make up
his own sonnets and also to make

00:52:32.251 --> 00:52:36.824
up a false bibliography,
as it were, and put on the

00:52:36.824 --> 00:52:42.260
margins all of the sources that
he never consulted--

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:45.545
as if you created a false
bibliography for a paper that

00:52:45.545 --> 00:52:46.579
you've written.
 

00:52:46.579 --> 00:52:50.119
This is a joke.
 

00:52:50.119 --> 00:52:52.768
It's a very amusing joke,
but it's also very serious.

00:52:52.768 --> 00:52:55.990
What the friend is telling
Cervantes is:

00:52:55.990 --> 00:53:00.039
forget about tradition,
forget about Aristotle;

00:53:00.039 --> 00:53:03.489
Aristotle never wrote about
romances of chivalry.

00:53:03.489 --> 00:53:08.018
You're doing something new,
you can just make it all up.

00:53:08.018 --> 00:53:11.643
This is what the prologue is a
kind of manifesto for the kind

00:53:11.643 --> 00:53:13.940
of book that the Quixote
is,

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:17.489
the kind of original new book
that it is, that it can break

00:53:17.489 --> 00:53:18.530
with tradition.
 

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:20.500
The friend says: make it all up!
 

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:23.929
I hope you don't take this
seriously yourselves in your own

00:53:23.929 --> 00:53:26.590
bibliographies when you write
your papers,

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:30.219
but this is the advice that the
friend gives--

00:53:30.219 --> 00:53:32.990
He says: oh,
I thought that you were wise!

00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.329
No!
 

00:53:33.329 --> 00:53:35.210
What you have to do is this.
 

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:38.896
Now, there are digs there at
Lope de Vega--remember I

00:53:38.896 --> 00:53:42.726
mentioned him in an earlier
class, Lope, who was a very

00:53:42.726 --> 00:53:44.570
successful playwright.
 

00:53:44.570 --> 00:53:47.126
He was rich,
famous, and vain,

00:53:47.126 --> 00:53:52.327
and Cervantes is taking a dig
at him because apparently Lope

00:53:52.327 --> 00:53:56.800
got himself some thesaurus,
compendium of quotations,

00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:00.744
of familiar quotations,
and used them in his works to

00:54:00.744 --> 00:54:04.860
make it seem like he was very
erudite and learned,

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:08.610
and Lope also added the 'de,'
Lope de Vega,

00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:11.639
to his last name to make it
seem as if he were an

00:54:11.639 --> 00:54:12.460
aristocrat.
 

00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:15.867
You know the 'de' in
French, Spanish or German

00:54:15.867 --> 00:54:19.275
'von,' indicates
aristocracy--So he's taking a

00:54:19.275 --> 00:54:20.849
dig at Lope de Vega.
 

00:54:20.849 --> 00:54:24.574
Lope was just so successful and
Lope had also said a few

00:54:24.574 --> 00:54:26.809
disparaging things about him...
 

00:54:26.809 --> 00:54:29.659
But all of that is sort of
contingent.

00:54:29.659 --> 00:54:33.371
The important thing in the
prologue is that he's saying,

00:54:33.371 --> 00:54:36.342
away with tradition,
I'm beginning here anew,

00:54:36.342 --> 00:54:37.760
I can make it up.
 

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:42.159
That is the whole point of
the...

00:54:42.159 --> 00:54:47.916
Now, I am going to end by
simply alluding to the beginning

00:54:47.916 --> 00:54:49.329
of the book.
 

00:54:49.329 --> 00:54:53.731
The birth of Don Quixote
is an act of self invention by a

00:54:53.731 --> 00:54:54.780
man of fifty.
 

00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:59.349
At the age, fifty was a very
advanced age.

00:54:59.349 --> 00:55:02.851
Age expectancy didn't go beyond
late thirties,

00:55:02.851 --> 00:55:04.875
early forties,
at the time,

00:55:04.875 --> 00:55:09.389
so this is also commensurate
with Cervantes's own age.

00:55:09.389 --> 00:55:11.664
He's in his late fifties when
he publishes his book,

00:55:11.664 --> 00:55:12.960
he says it in the prologue.
 

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.760
It's an act of self invention
by a man of fifty.

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:20.989
He feels free to create to
himself beyond family.

00:55:20.989 --> 00:55:24.829
We don't learn anything about
Don Quixote's family,

00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:28.822
only about his niece,
but, do we learn anything about

00:55:28.822 --> 00:55:29.744
his parents?
 

00:55:29.744 --> 00:55:32.940
No;
about his birth? No;

00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:37.210
about his needs? No.
 

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:44.896
Cervantes has created a hero
who is beyond Freud's family

00:55:44.896 --> 00:55:46.268
romance.
 

00:55:46.268 --> 00:55:49.090
In Freud's theories the family
romance is mommy,

00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:51.989
daddy, and the child;
the boy is love in with mommy,

00:55:51.989 --> 00:55:52.849
and all of that.
 

00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:56.039
That is the family romance,
and you go through life with

00:55:56.039 --> 00:55:59.170
the resentment of daddy,
or your secret love for mommy,

00:55:59.170 --> 00:56:00.329
and all of that.
 

00:56:00.329 --> 00:56:01.570
That's the family romance.
 

00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:06.364
This is a mock version of
Freud--But Cervantes's character

00:56:06.364 --> 00:56:08.300
is born beyond Freud.
 

00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:10.822
When you're fifty,
who cares about your parents

00:56:10.822 --> 00:56:11.809
and all of that?
 

00:56:11.809 --> 00:56:13.630
You are who you are.
 

00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:16.773
And not only is he who he is,
but he wills himself to be

00:56:16.773 --> 00:56:18.889
something else at the age of
fifty.

00:56:18.889 --> 00:56:23.010
It is important that Don
Quixote be that old.

00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:27.789
Can you think of another
literary hero who is that old?

00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:33.027
Celestina, but she had as
co-protagonists the two young

00:56:33.027 --> 00:56:33.900
lovers.
 

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:37.576
But no, protagonists were
either men in their full

00:56:37.576 --> 00:56:41.478
strength, like Ulysses,
Aeneas, the pilgrim in the

00:56:41.478 --> 00:56:45.079
Divine Comedy,
I think, is thirty-three.

00:56:45.079 --> 00:56:48.130
Not an old man.
 

00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:50.480
Why?
 

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:55.260
Because his self invention is
an act of will based on nothing.

00:56:55.260 --> 00:57:01.797
He's beyond all of the
pressures of family and of need,

00:57:01.797 --> 00:57:06.639
and this is why he can invent
himself.

00:57:06.639 --> 00:57:12.717
Don Quixote's true family and
genealogy is the books that he

00:57:12.717 --> 00:57:13.440
read.
 

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:19.000

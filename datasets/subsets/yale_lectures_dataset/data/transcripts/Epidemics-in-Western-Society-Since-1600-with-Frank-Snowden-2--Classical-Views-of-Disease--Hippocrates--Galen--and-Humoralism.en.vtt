00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.517
Prof: Without more ado,
then, we'll turn to our topic

00:00:05.517 --> 00:00:09.290
of the morning,
which is about the first

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.030
embodiment of a rational
scientific medicine,

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.800
which is rather an
extraordinary one because it

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.670
lasts from the fifth century
B.C.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.460
down to the nineteenth century
as a dominant--not

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.050
exclusive--but a dominant
medical scientific paradigm.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.898
It was associated with this
idea of the first form of a

00:00:37.898 --> 00:00:42.776
rational,
secular, naturalistic form of

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:46.848
medicine,
with ancient Greece in the

00:00:46.848 --> 00:00:53.117
fifth century,
and in particular with the

00:00:53.117 --> 00:01:00.427
so-called father of medicine,
Hippocrates,

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:06.250
who lived from about 460 to 377
B.C.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.210
Now, there's some debate about
whether he was one person or a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.610
school, a group,
of people.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.733
There is a corpus of
Hippocratic writings that

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:25.450
consists of about sixty works,
perhaps by multiple hands.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.540
But that issue won't really
concern us.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.806
We're concerned with
Hippocrates as either this

00:01:32.806 --> 00:01:37.907
composite or single figure,
and with the various schools

00:01:37.907 --> 00:01:40.690
that followed in his name.
 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.519
The sixty works,
some of them are very famous to

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:45.660
you already.
 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.340
You know about the Hippocratic
Oath.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.174
We'll be talking about such
other works as On the Sacred

00:01:53.174 --> 00:01:57.592
Disease, On Human
Nature, Epidemics,

00:01:57.592 --> 00:02:00.510
On Airs, Waters,
Places;

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.680
and he also had a collection of
aphorisms.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.840
One would note the variety of
the Hippocratic corpus.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.120
It consists of a whole series
of things.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.349
He/they invented case
histories, and they're included.

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.889
There are lecture notes.
 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.490
There are memoranda of all
sorts;

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.674
writings on every form of
medical practice at the time:

00:02:26.674 --> 00:02:30.706
surgery, obstetrics,
diet, the environment,

00:02:30.706 --> 00:02:32.340
therapeutics.
 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.370
All of that forms part of the
Hippocratic corpus.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.050
So, enormous variety.
 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.700
In terms of what Hippocrates
accomplished,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.145
I'd like to make a contrast,
and that is with the

00:02:49.145 --> 00:02:52.889
supernatural view of disease.
 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.169
And the first form we could
think of that,

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:59.580
in drawing our contrast--the
contrast to what Hippocrates

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.188
accomplished--
we can see it in terms of the

00:03:03.188 --> 00:03:08.211
breakthrough from something that
preceded it and went alongside

00:03:08.211 --> 00:03:10.382
it,
down to our own day,

00:03:10.382 --> 00:03:14.707
and this would be first of all
the supernatural view of

00:03:14.707 --> 00:03:18.669
disease;
that epidemics and pestilence

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:24.300
are divine punishment sent by an
angry god for sin and

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.000
disobedience.
 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.960
You can see this in many parts
of our culture.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.030
It's embodied in the Bible,
for example.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.762
In Genesis, you know that Adam
and Eve lived happily and

00:03:36.762 --> 00:03:40.720
enjoyed eternal life in the
Garden of Eden,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.721
until they committed the sin of
eating of the forbidden tree of

00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:49.190
the fruit of knowledge of good
and evil,

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.718
and as a result this was
original sin and they were

00:03:52.718 --> 00:03:55.190
kicked out of the Garden of
Eden.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.348
From then on for things they
had to work.

00:03:58.348 --> 00:04:04.468
They also became subject to
disease and to death.

00:04:04.468 --> 00:04:06.740
They were immortal until that
time.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.677
So, we see in Genesis the
embodiment of this idea that

00:04:10.677 --> 00:04:13.280
diseases are a punishment of
sin.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.110
This was also clear--you can
read further in the Bible,

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.740
in the book of Exodus,
where you learn about the

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:27.456
bondage of the Israelites in
Egypt and God asking for Moses

00:04:27.456 --> 00:04:33.269
and Aaron for the Pharaoh to
release his chosen people.

00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:38.644
But the Pharaoh's heart was
hardened and so the Egyptians

00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:44.596
were punished with this series
of terrible plagues that are all

00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:45.940
in Exodus.
 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.755
Another way of embodiment of
this was in Psalm 91,

00:04:50.755 --> 00:04:56.259
and this is of particular
importance to us--let's move to

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.620
share this with you.
 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.759
This is the text of Psalm 91.
 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:09.447
This is particularly important
because it embodies the idea of

00:05:09.447 --> 00:05:14.600
plague and pestilence as a
punishment by God.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.100
But also in terms of our
historical experience,

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.757
as you're reading Daniel Defoe,
you'll realize that it's Psalm

00:05:22.757 --> 00:05:27.338
91 that was read out from the
Christian churches during times

00:05:27.338 --> 00:05:28.560
of epidemic.
 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.278
This was the great plague psalm.
 

00:05:31.278 --> 00:05:35.160
It embodies hope and an
interpretation of what the

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.089
experience of plague was all
about.

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:40.720
Let me read part of it here.
 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.129
"Thou shalt not be afraid
for the terror by night,

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:47.339
nor for the arrow that flieth
by day,

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:50.069
nor for the pestilence that
walketh in darkness,

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:54.509
nor for the destruction that
wasteth at noonday.

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:59.307
A thousand shall fall at thy
side, and ten thousand at thy

00:05:59.307 --> 00:06:03.180
right hand, but it shall not
come nigh thee.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.701
Only with thine eyes shall thou
behold and see the reward of the

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:09.490
wicked.
 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.937
Because thou hast made the
Lord, which is my refuge,

00:06:13.937 --> 00:06:16.990
even the most high by
habitation.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.475
There shall no evil befall thee;
neither shall any plague come

00:06:22.475 --> 00:06:24.350
nigh thy dwelling."
 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:31.064
So, if you renounce sin,
the pestilence won't come near

00:06:31.064 --> 00:06:31.810
you.
 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.589
Let me turn also to another
embodiment in culture,

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:39.973
our Western culture,
and this is the opening scene

00:06:39.973 --> 00:06:44.315
of Homer's Iliad,
which as you know is all about

00:06:44.315 --> 00:06:49.298
the Trojan War,
and it begins just before this

00:06:49.298 --> 00:06:52.639
scene with Achilles' anger.
 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.370
That is to say,
Achilles was the greatest of

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.569
the Greek warriors,
but the Greek King Agamemnon

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:03.680
had taken his concubine for his
own,

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.261
and as a result,
enraged, Achilles withdrew from

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:11.379
combat and sulked in his tent.
 

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:15.420
Now, he had a friend who was a
priest of the god Apollo,

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.569
and this friend tried to
intervene and beseeched

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:24.160
Agamemnon to write the wrong and
return the woman.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.278
But Agamemnon rebuffed Apollo's
priest;

00:07:28.278 --> 00:07:31.750
or as we might say,
he dissed him.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.894
And, so, what we have here is
this tremendous and terrifying

00:07:36.894 --> 00:07:40.819
scene at the beginning of the
Iliad.

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:44.209
Let me just quote from the
beginning then.

00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:49.875
"Over and over the old man
prayed as he walked in solitude

00:07:49.875 --> 00:07:51.430
to King Apollo.
 

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:56.702
'Hear me Lord of the silver bow;
bring to pass this wish I pray

00:07:56.702 --> 00:07:57.160
for.
 

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:02.300
Let your arrows make the
Danaans pay for my tears shed.'

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.920
So he spoke in prayer,
and Phoebus Apollo heard him,

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.180
and strode down along the
pinnacles of Olympus,

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.896
angered in his heart,
carrying across his shoulders

00:08:13.896 --> 00:08:18.987
the bow and the hooded quiver,
and the shafts clashed on the

00:08:18.987 --> 00:08:22.959
shoulders of the god,
walking angrily.

00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:27.014
He came as night comes down,
and knelt then apart and

00:08:27.014 --> 00:08:30.290
opposite the ships,
and let go an arrow.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:34.759
Terrible was the clash from the
bow of silver.

00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:39.197
First he went after the mules
and the circling hounds,

00:08:39.197 --> 00:08:43.970
then let go a tearing arrow
against the men themselves and

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.308
struck them.
 

00:08:45.308 --> 00:08:49.378
The corpse fires burned
everywhere and did not stop

00:08:49.378 --> 00:08:50.678
burning."
 

00:08:50.678 --> 00:08:57.615
So, that was Apollo punishing
the Greeks on behalf of his

00:08:57.615 --> 00:08:58.730
priest.
 

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.735
Or let me also mention
something, an example,

00:09:01.735 --> 00:09:04.470
that's more recent and closer
to home;

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.230
that is, I want to talk for a
minute about a Yalie.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:12.779
And this is our friend here
John Humphrey Noyes of the

00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:16.409
nineteenth century,
who was at the Yale Divinity

00:09:16.409 --> 00:09:18.783
School,
and he read the pieces we've

00:09:18.783 --> 00:09:22.274
just talked about,
and thought about disease as a

00:09:22.274 --> 00:09:25.692
punishment for sin,
and decided well there was a

00:09:25.692 --> 00:09:26.230
remedy.
 

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.440
And, so, in all modesty he and
a group of his friends decided

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.158
that they were going to renounce
sin all together,

00:09:34.158 --> 00:09:37.470
and they called themselves The
Perfectionists.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.178
And they founded an ideal
community,

00:09:40.178 --> 00:09:43.105
first in Putney,
Vermont, and then in Oneida in

00:09:43.105 --> 00:09:46.097
New York State--
it's part of the history of

00:09:46.097 --> 00:09:50.522
American utopian communities--
in which they renounced sin and

00:09:50.522 --> 00:09:54.309
were going to live together in
harmony and peace,

00:09:54.309 --> 00:09:56.960
forever, as eternal people.
 

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.633
And every morning began with a
mutual criticism in which they

00:10:01.633 --> 00:10:04.360
pointed out each other's
faults--

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:09.904
this must have been a lot of
fun--in order that they not fall

00:10:09.904 --> 00:10:14.250
by the wayside and lapse once
again into sin.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.940
Well, I'm sorry to tell
you--this was the 1840s--

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.501
by the 1890s the ideal
community had become instead a

00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:26.452
joint stock company,
and you still have Oneida

00:10:26.452 --> 00:10:28.308
pottery and silverware.
 

00:10:28.308 --> 00:10:32.336
And I'm very sorry to report
that all of the members of the

00:10:32.336 --> 00:10:34.350
community have been buried.
 

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:38.426
I don't know if that was
because they couldn't stick the

00:10:38.426 --> 00:10:42.279
pace, or if the concept was
wrong from the outset.

00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:46.206
In any case,
this was an embodiment,

00:10:46.206 --> 00:10:52.379
then, of the idea of disease as
a punishment for sin.

00:10:52.379 --> 00:10:57.517
But if we view this view of
pestilence as divine punishment,

00:10:57.517 --> 00:11:01.610
it does at least imply a
law-governed cosmos.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.820
Disease exists for an
intelligible reason,

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.889
and it implies a rational
therapeutics,

00:11:07.889 --> 00:11:10.950
which is repentance:
propitiation of God,

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:15.341
amendment of conduct,
and renewed obedience to the

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:15.970
laws.
 

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.549
There's another variation of a
supernatural view,

00:11:19.549 --> 00:11:23.727
which is more capricious,
and let's call that the demonic

00:11:23.727 --> 00:11:25.370
theory of disease.
 

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:30.028
This postulates that the world
is populated by powerful

00:11:30.028 --> 00:11:34.947
arbitrary and evil spirits who
cause disease through their

00:11:34.947 --> 00:11:36.759
malign influence.
 

00:11:36.759 --> 00:11:42.239
These may be evil persons,
such as witches or poisoners,

00:11:42.239 --> 00:11:47.619
the disembodied spirits of the
dead, superhuman beings,

00:11:47.619 --> 00:11:50.110
or the devil himself.
 

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:54.679
We'll see this view throughout
the course, the idea that

00:11:54.679 --> 00:11:59.750
epidemic diseases are diabolical
plots, not natural events.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:04.731
There's some occult secret
crime caused by the poisoning of

00:12:04.731 --> 00:12:08.107
witches or scapegoats,
and this gives rise to

00:12:08.107 --> 00:12:11.173
witch-hunts,
to hunt down and punish the

00:12:11.173 --> 00:12:11.850
guilty.
 

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:16.438
We know this famously in the
seventeenth century and in our

00:12:16.438 --> 00:12:18.259
own country at Salem.
 

00:12:18.259 --> 00:12:21.687
But the idea was clearly
expressed in Europe by Martin

00:12:21.687 --> 00:12:24.855
Luther who declared,
"I would have no pity on

00:12:24.855 --> 00:12:25.889
the witches.
 

00:12:25.889 --> 00:12:28.548
I would burn them all."
 

00:12:28.548 --> 00:12:32.678
Alternatively--that was a good
therapeutic idea--

00:12:32.678 --> 00:12:37.153
alternatively a person could be
deemed to be inhabited or

00:12:37.153 --> 00:12:42.038
possessed by an evil spirit,
and in that case the cure was

00:12:42.038 --> 00:12:45.360
to cast out the devil through
exorcism.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.094
And this cosmology survives in
our own language when we talk

00:12:49.094 --> 00:12:51.878
today about someone acting
"like someone

00:12:51.878 --> 00:12:55.168
possessed,"
or "out of his mind."

00:12:55.168 --> 00:12:59.850
And healers pursuing these
sorts of ideas would invoke

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.500
magic, or have incantations.
 

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.403
They'd prescribe special
concoctions, chants,

00:13:06.403 --> 00:13:08.710
sacred rites and spells.
 

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:12.125
And in European history,
a relatively recent

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:16.971
illustration of that idea was
the idea of the healing power of

00:13:16.971 --> 00:13:18.558
the royal touch.
 

00:13:18.558 --> 00:13:20.874
Charles II of England,
for example,

00:13:20.874 --> 00:13:25.096
administered this treatment in
the seventeenth century to about

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:26.389
100,000 people.
 

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:29.058
So, healers could do that.
 

00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:33.111
They could also recommend magic
practices, offerings and

00:13:33.111 --> 00:13:37.171
sacrifices;
magic charms to ward off the

00:13:37.171 --> 00:13:40.035
evil spell;
or they could recommend

00:13:40.035 --> 00:13:43.832
escaping by taking flight;
or invoking the power of a

00:13:43.832 --> 00:13:46.976
powerful ally,
as in the Christian cult of

00:13:46.976 --> 00:13:50.350
saints that we'll be talking
about later.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.288
So, if you hold that up--those
two views,

00:13:53.288 --> 00:13:57.820
then, of supernatural
interpretations of disease--

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:02.009
then you can understand the
breakthrough that was made in

00:14:02.009 --> 00:14:03.730
fifth century Greece.
 

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:08.418
This was in contrast to the
supernatural divine and demonic

00:14:08.418 --> 00:14:13.024
theories, and it's in contrast
to them that we can see the

00:14:13.024 --> 00:14:18.215
importance of a new idea;
the idea that disease instead

00:14:18.215 --> 00:14:24.690
is a naturalistic event that can
be understood by natural causes.

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.761
Examples of this new,
naturalistic,

00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:31.830
secular view abounded in the
fifth century.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:35.159
You can see it in Thucydides,
in his account of the

00:14:35.159 --> 00:14:38.409
Peloponnesian War,
the famous Plague of Athens

00:14:38.409 --> 00:14:42.306
that may have been typhus,
or more recently it was thought

00:14:42.306 --> 00:14:43.710
to have been typhoid.
 

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.450
But in any case it was a
natural event,

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:50.705
and is described as such by
Thucydides, with no reference to

00:14:50.705 --> 00:14:53.230
the occult or the supernatural.
 

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:58.548
You can see it in Hippocrates'
discussion on epidemics in which

00:14:58.548 --> 00:15:03.440
diseases, epidemic diseases,
are caused by a corruption of

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.470
the air.
 

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:08.741
But let me talk about this very
famous example,

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:11.714
and dramatic one,
of Hippocrates,

00:15:11.714 --> 00:15:14.778
On the Sacred Disease.
 

00:15:14.778 --> 00:15:19.020
By the sacred disease he meant
epilepsy, and it looks--I guess

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.984
if you wanted any disease--it
looks like a possession by a

00:15:22.984 --> 00:15:23.679
demon.
 

00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:25.379
It is epilepsy.
 

00:15:25.379 --> 00:15:29.072
And Hippocrates wants to tell
us that this is not a

00:15:29.072 --> 00:15:31.879
supernatural event,
or a possession.

00:15:31.879 --> 00:15:35.590
He says instead something
extremely different.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:42.395
What he tells us is that:
"It is thus with regard to

00:15:42.395 --> 00:15:45.798
the disease called sacred.
 

00:15:45.798 --> 00:15:51.171
It appears to me to be no wise
more divine or sacred than other

00:15:51.171 --> 00:15:56.370
diseases, but has a natural
cause, like other afflictions.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:16:01.769
Men regard its nature and cause
as divine, from ignorance and

00:16:01.769 --> 00:16:02.580
wonder.
 

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:07.340
And this notion of its divinity
is kept up by their inability to

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.548
comprehend it.
 

00:16:08.548 --> 00:16:14.474
Neither truly do I count it as
a worthy opinion to hold that

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:18.190
the body of man is polluted by
God;

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.230
the most impure by the most
holy.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.861
For were the body defiled,
it would be likely to be

00:16:24.861 --> 00:16:28.350
purified and sanctified,
rather than polluted.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:32.769
Those who first referred this
malady to the gods appear to me

00:16:32.769 --> 00:16:36.230
to have been just such persons
as the conjurers,

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.808
mountebanks and charlatans are.
 

00:16:38.808 --> 00:16:42.533
Such persons then,
using the divinity as a pretext

00:16:42.533 --> 00:16:47.019
and screen for their own
inability to afford assistance,

00:16:47.019 --> 00:16:50.428
have given out that the disease
is sacred."

00:16:50.428 --> 00:16:55.178
This was a very major
breakthrough conceptually,

00:16:55.178 --> 00:17:01.139
the beginning of the foundation
of a scientific medicine.

00:17:01.139 --> 00:17:07.210
So, therapeutics then got rid,
in a naturalistic view,

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:12.250
of chance, potions,
spells and sacrifices;

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.828
and exorcism,
appeasement of the gods.

00:17:15.828 --> 00:17:19.394
The importance of this
momentous step in human

00:17:19.394 --> 00:17:24.304
consciousness was expressed by a
Yale professor of epidemiology

00:17:24.304 --> 00:17:27.488
in the 1940s,
Charles-Edward Winslow,

00:17:27.488 --> 00:17:31.769
who wrote--and let me quote a
sentence or two from him.

00:17:31.769 --> 00:17:35.888
"If disease is postulated
as caused by gods,

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:39.321
daemons or demons,
scientific progress is

00:17:39.321 --> 00:17:40.608
impossible.
 

00:17:40.608 --> 00:17:44.082
If it is attributed to
hypothetical humors,

00:17:44.082 --> 00:17:47.390
the theory can be tested and
improved.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:52.212
The conception of natural
causation was the essential

00:17:52.212 --> 00:17:53.420
first step.
 

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:57.529
It marks incomparably the most
epochal advance in the

00:17:57.529 --> 00:18:00.690
intellectual history of
mankind."

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.520
That perhaps is putting it a
little strongly,

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.710
but you certainly get the
point.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:11.040
Now, why perhaps was there a
rational scientific medicine in

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.118
fifth century Greece?
 

00:18:13.118 --> 00:18:17.008
Here I think the main part of
the answer has to be

00:18:17.008 --> 00:18:21.609
imponderable factors such as the
inspiration of Hippocrates

00:18:21.609 --> 00:18:24.150
himself, and his associates.
 

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:28.203
But there were influences we
could point to as important:

00:18:28.203 --> 00:18:32.186
The absence of a priestly
bureaucracy, with the power to

00:18:32.186 --> 00:18:36.298
sanction heretics;
the centralized city states;

00:18:36.298 --> 00:18:41.925
the legacy of Greek natural
philosophy, the work of Plato

00:18:41.925 --> 00:18:47.410
and Aristotle in particular;
a culture of individualism.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:51.747
And I think we also need to
remember the Hippocratics'

00:18:51.747 --> 00:18:52.730
positions.
 

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:56.998
Although they were known to
treat the poor and slaves,

00:18:56.998 --> 00:19:01.670
their care was not by and large
available to the masses.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:06.769
The primary clientele consisted
of educated, prosperous elites

00:19:06.769 --> 00:19:11.534
in ancient Greece and ancient
Rome, and this was a medical

00:19:11.534 --> 00:19:14.210
philosophy that suited them.
 

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:18.518
The educated doctor and the
educated patient spoke the same

00:19:18.518 --> 00:19:20.997
language,
and the therapies that the

00:19:20.997 --> 00:19:24.885
physician proposed,
such as a special diet or rest,

00:19:24.885 --> 00:19:28.250
were remedies the wealthy could
afford.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:33.690
We should say that Hippocratic
medicine is still with us.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:38.190
We can see it in the return to
holistic medicine.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.625
We can see it also in the
Muslim world,

00:19:41.625 --> 00:19:47.231
and you can still be treated in
Unani medicine by a Hippocratic

00:19:47.231 --> 00:19:48.950
style medicine.
 

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:53.262
And you can see it in certain
popular cultural precepts,

00:19:53.262 --> 00:19:57.420
such as "feed a cold and
starve a fever."

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:01.269
Well, if that's its importance,
let's look at its content.

00:20:01.269 --> 00:20:06.455
What was the content of this
first embodiment of scientific

00:20:06.455 --> 00:20:07.440
medicine?
 

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.328
And it was humoralism.
 

00:20:09.328 --> 00:20:13.970
Here let's talk about what that
is.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:18.959
The fundamental assumption was
that there's a correspondence

00:20:18.959 --> 00:20:23.779
between the macrocosm of the
universe and the microcosm of

00:20:23.779 --> 00:20:25.808
the individual body.
 

00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:30.932
Both are composed of the same
materials, subject to the same

00:20:30.932 --> 00:20:36.230
laws, and disorder can occur in
one and be followed by disease

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:37.618
in the body.
 

00:20:37.618 --> 00:20:42.519
According to Aristotle and
natural philosophy,

00:20:42.519 --> 00:20:49.598
the macrocosm consisted of four
elements that you can see here.

00:20:49.598 --> 00:20:56.769
They were earth,
water, air and fire.

00:20:56.769 --> 00:21:01.769
And each of the elements is
associated with four qualities,

00:21:01.769 --> 00:21:04.960
which can be dry and hot like
fire;

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.319
or dry and cold;
or cold and wet;

00:21:08.319 --> 00:21:09.858
or wet and hot.
 

00:21:09.858 --> 00:21:13.777
So, the elements embody also
four qualities,

00:21:13.777 --> 00:21:17.240
in different proportions,
of course.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:21.576
And this went on over the
centuries, and there were four

00:21:21.576 --> 00:21:25.440
seasons, four winds,
later on four evangelists.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.480
The point for us is there was
also a microcosm,

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:33.314
and one can see the theory
expounded on human nature in

00:21:33.314 --> 00:21:39.184
which there are four humors,
which are phlegm,

00:21:39.184 --> 00:21:45.558
black bile, yellow bile and
blood.

00:21:45.558 --> 00:21:52.150
And each of those--also the
body is composed of these--and

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:57.123
each has qualities of as being
wet and cold,

00:21:57.123 --> 00:21:59.318
or hot and dry.
 

00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:03.787
This also determines--the
balance of these humors in the

00:22:03.787 --> 00:22:08.253
body--the four temperaments:
whether you're melancholic,

00:22:08.253 --> 00:22:11.259
phlegmatic, choleric or
sanguine.

00:22:11.259 --> 00:22:13.259
Those words survive in our
culture.

00:22:13.259 --> 00:22:16.845
There are four ages of man,
four principal organs of the

00:22:16.845 --> 00:22:20.170
body: the spleen,
the brain, the liver and heart.

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:21.890
You see the importance of four.
 

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:25.009
And the system is axiomatic.
 

00:22:25.009 --> 00:22:29.900
It's based on deductive
reasoning from first principles.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.472
Central, of course,
to all of it was the climate of

00:22:33.472 --> 00:22:37.046
Greece, with its seasonal
patterns and its specific

00:22:37.046 --> 00:22:38.690
patient population.
 

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:44.519
Many were malarial victims with
the complications of pneumonia.

00:22:44.519 --> 00:22:48.059
And Hippocrates,
indeed, was the world's first

00:22:48.059 --> 00:22:49.318
malariologist.
 

00:22:49.318 --> 00:22:52.747
Now, health consisted--was
called eucrasia,

00:22:52.747 --> 00:22:56.827
which meant a balance or
equilibrium of the humors,

00:22:56.827 --> 00:22:59.440
and therefore the qualities.
 

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:04.048
And variations are possible,
up to a certain threshold,

00:23:04.048 --> 00:23:07.375
and at various times in your
life--or from one person to

00:23:07.375 --> 00:23:10.067
another--
the balance among the four

00:23:10.067 --> 00:23:11.548
humors can change.
 

00:23:11.548 --> 00:23:15.078
But once you cross a certain
threshold in variation--

00:23:15.078 --> 00:23:19.058
that is, one humor becomes
overly dominant,

00:23:19.058 --> 00:23:23.660
or one humor is lacking in
sufficient supply--

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.700
that's an imbalance.
 

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:29.337
That's dyscrasia;
an excess or deficiency of one

00:23:29.337 --> 00:23:32.298
of the humors,
and that is disease.

00:23:32.298 --> 00:23:35.470
So, we know what disease is
then.

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:38.670
It's an imbalance of the humors.
 

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:43.243
Note that there is no
single--that is to say there

00:23:43.243 --> 00:23:48.940
aren't discrete individual
diseases, as in modern medicine;

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:52.635
that is, disease is classified
as typhoid, cancer,

00:23:52.635 --> 00:23:54.900
pneumonia, and all the rest.
 

00:23:54.900 --> 00:24:00.259
Disease instead was a holistic
phenomenon of body equilibrium.

00:24:00.259 --> 00:24:04.700
There was, in a sense,
only one disease.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.380
Now, what were the causes?
 

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:11.240
The causes were said to be,
what we might call in modern

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:16.701
jargon, environmental insults;
that Galen later on was to

00:24:16.701 --> 00:24:19.940
codify as the six non-naturals.
 

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:24.730
The human body and constitution
then had contact with the air,

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:27.796
which might be corrupted,
or "miasmatic,"

00:24:27.796 --> 00:24:29.328
as it was called later.
 

00:24:29.328 --> 00:24:34.645
Motion, or what we might call
exercise, was the second--or its

00:24:34.645 --> 00:24:36.390
lack--non-natural.
 

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:40.767
Sleep or wakefulness;
excretion or retention of

00:24:40.767 --> 00:24:45.715
whatever was ingested;
and the passions of the soul,

00:24:45.715 --> 00:24:51.493
these were the non-naturals
that could tip the body into

00:24:51.493 --> 00:24:52.650
disease.
 

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:57.618
Restoring health was based in
part on nature itself;

00:24:57.618 --> 00:25:00.768
that is to say,
there's a teleology of the

00:25:00.768 --> 00:25:04.760
body, embodied in the phrase
vis medicatrix

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.167
naturae;
which is the healing power of

00:25:08.167 --> 00:25:08.769
nature.
 

00:25:08.769 --> 00:25:11.970
And the means to restore--the
body,

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.608
in other words,
strives to restore equilibrium,

00:25:15.608 --> 00:25:19.904
through its innate heat or
through the elimination of

00:25:19.904 --> 00:25:22.660
excess humors,
when you sweat,

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:27.328
you sneeze or you vomit;
for all of that is your body's

00:25:27.328 --> 00:25:32.248
attempt to get rid of the humor
that's making you sick because

00:25:32.248 --> 00:25:33.618
of its excess.
 

00:25:33.618 --> 00:25:38.329
So, this led then to humoral
therapeutics.

00:25:38.329 --> 00:25:40.690
And let's talk about that.
 

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:46.068
The basis of medical strategy
was that the physician was the

00:25:46.068 --> 00:25:49.170
ally of nature,
and of the body.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:52.959
The body was trying to restore
itself to health,

00:25:52.959 --> 00:25:58.279
and the physician would join it
in doing battle against disease.

00:25:58.279 --> 00:26:03.160
He would read the signs to
decipher the underlying process;

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.576
would take a case history;
would practice close

00:26:06.576 --> 00:26:11.318
observation, taking the pulse,
listening to the body;

00:26:11.318 --> 00:26:16.269
and would examine the urine,
its color, its density.

00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:21.470
He would smell it and taste it,
and see whether it contained

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:25.788
blood or was frothy,
as all of those were worrying

00:26:25.788 --> 00:26:27.640
prognostic signs.
 

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.974
It was a holistic treatment
where you didn't treat

00:26:30.974 --> 00:26:34.380
individual symptoms,
but the whole constitution.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:38.358
And it also had an idea of the
individualism of the patient.

00:26:38.358 --> 00:26:42.123
Treatment should be tailored to
the constitution of the

00:26:42.123 --> 00:26:43.029
individual.
 

00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:48.531
There are no disease entities,
because disease is not a thing

00:26:48.531 --> 00:26:50.000
but a process.
 

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:56.034
This was a medicine that was
rather indifferent to diagnosis

00:26:56.034 --> 00:26:58.078
or classification.
 

00:26:58.078 --> 00:27:02.102
What it stressed instead was
the answer to the patient's

00:27:02.102 --> 00:27:05.247
eternal question,
"Am I going to be all

00:27:05.247 --> 00:27:06.710
right doc?"
 

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:12.128
Prognosis was what really
mattered to the Hippocratic

00:27:12.128 --> 00:27:13.380
physician.
 

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:17.930
The therapeutic principle was
that opposites treat opposites.

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:22.328
So, if you have an excess of a
dry and cold humor,

00:27:22.328 --> 00:27:27.511
like a black bile,
if that's the humor that's

00:27:27.511 --> 00:27:33.409
causing your illness,
then you would like perhaps to

00:27:33.409 --> 00:27:38.932
give the patient a food to
ingest that would be wet and

00:27:38.932 --> 00:27:41.101
hot;
and hot in this case,

00:27:41.101 --> 00:27:43.660
think of it not simply as the
touch.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:47.660
We think of it when we talk
about spicy food as being hot.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:51.741
All the elements that you have
also have qualities,

00:27:51.741 --> 00:27:56.068
and so diet is very important
to this therapeutics.

00:27:56.068 --> 00:27:58.730
The tools available to the
physician, then,

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:00.250
are first of all diet.
 

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:04.917
In some sense the Hippocratic
physicians thought we are what

00:28:04.917 --> 00:28:08.213
we eat,
and all foodstuffs had

00:28:08.213 --> 00:28:11.375
qualities--hot,
cold, moist,

00:28:11.375 --> 00:28:17.102
dry--to balance an opposite
defect or excess in the human

00:28:17.102 --> 00:28:17.920
body.
 

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.380
Exercise was also important.
 

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.506
A change of environment;
in modern terms,

00:28:23.506 --> 00:28:26.200
going to a spa or a sanatorium.
 

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:32.058
Moderation in the emotions,
moderation in sex.

00:28:32.058 --> 00:28:36.570
And medication was important,
because they did practice,

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:40.180
Hippocratic physicians,
internal medicine.

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:45.529
Examples were to promote
evacuation by providing emetics,

00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:49.160
sudorifics, purgatives or
diuretics.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:54.920
And most important perhaps was
a primacy of venesection--

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.500
by which I mean bloodletting or
phlebotomy--

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.640
that became the hallmark of the
orthodox physician.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.057
Medicine, in other words,
was conceived as a process of

00:29:07.057 --> 00:29:11.228
addition and subtraction,
adding what is wanting and

00:29:11.228 --> 00:29:14.009
subtracting what is in excess.
 

00:29:14.009 --> 00:29:17.838
Now, you may have your doubts
about venesection.

00:29:17.838 --> 00:29:22.567
Let me just mention some of its
advantages in the eyes of

00:29:22.567 --> 00:29:24.680
Hippocratic physicians.
 

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.328
It was systematic,
like disease itself.

00:29:28.328 --> 00:29:32.359
Its effects were immediate and
you could control them.

00:29:32.359 --> 00:29:34.098
It was speedy.
 

00:29:34.098 --> 00:29:38.188
Its limits were also
self-evident to the experienced

00:29:38.188 --> 00:29:38.910
doctor.
 

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:42.472
Perhaps the patient fainted,
the pulse disappeared,

00:29:42.472 --> 00:29:45.038
or the color of the blood
altered.

00:29:45.038 --> 00:29:48.819
There were however,
of course, contraindications to

00:29:48.819 --> 00:29:51.692
bloodletting:
old age and efficiency of

00:29:51.692 --> 00:29:53.848
blood;
the summer heat;

00:29:53.848 --> 00:29:57.549
evacuation already occurring by
other means;

00:29:57.549 --> 00:29:59.529
or extreme cold.
 

00:29:59.529 --> 00:30:03.098
So, the lancet,
the instrument for

00:30:03.098 --> 00:30:06.548
bloodletting--
there we have real

00:30:06.548 --> 00:30:11.798
lancets--became the symbol of
the orthodox physician,

00:30:11.798 --> 00:30:14.338
down through the nineteenth
century.

00:30:14.338 --> 00:30:18.436
Now, note that there is no real
humoral physiology,

00:30:18.436 --> 00:30:21.880
no idea of the circulation of
the blood.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:27.080
The heart is not a pump but a
furnace, drawing air from the

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:31.654
lungs, heating it and
distributing it as innate heat

00:30:31.654 --> 00:30:33.088
in the body.
 

00:30:33.088 --> 00:30:36.939
So, this was the first
embodiment of scientific

00:30:36.939 --> 00:30:37.858
medicine.
 

00:30:37.858 --> 00:30:41.836
I want to talk about an
alteration that it went through,

00:30:41.836 --> 00:30:44.730
through the second father of
medicine.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:49.409
And this is another Greek
physician, who lived however in

00:30:49.409 --> 00:30:52.250
ancient Rome,
and that is Galen.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:56.210
And that's a picture.
 

00:30:56.210 --> 00:31:00.939
Now, his personal--he lived in
the second century A.D.,

00:31:00.939 --> 00:31:05.492
from 130 to about 201,
with his formative years being

00:31:05.492 --> 00:31:07.420
lived out in Rome.
 

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.828
His personal qualities are
important.

00:31:09.828 --> 00:31:12.368
He was very different from
Hippocrates.

00:31:12.368 --> 00:31:16.970
Hippocrates was a great
observer, an empiricist.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:22.758
Galen instead prided himself
above all on his knowledge of

00:31:22.758 --> 00:31:25.500
the texts of Hippocrates.
 

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:29.529
He almost worshipped
Hippocrates, but regarded

00:31:29.529 --> 00:31:34.096
himself as the authorized
interpreter of Hippocratic

00:31:34.096 --> 00:31:37.680
works, which he turned into a
dogma.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:41.519
Now, in Rome,
Galen was physician to the

00:31:41.519 --> 00:31:42.798
gladiators.
 

00:31:42.798 --> 00:31:47.660
His personal position helps
explain his influence.

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:50.930
He then became private doctor
to the emperor.

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:54.857
And he regarded himself as the
ideal physician,

00:31:54.857 --> 00:31:57.250
philosopher and scientist.
 

00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:00.778
He was a man of over-weaning
self-confidence,

00:32:00.778 --> 00:32:04.146
who had nothing but withering
scorn for his opponents and

00:32:04.146 --> 00:32:06.778
colleagues,
whom he called "murderers,

00:32:06.778 --> 00:32:11.048
amateurs, unversed in
Hippocratic wisdom."

00:32:11.048 --> 00:32:14.618
He called them "more
ignorant than animals."

00:32:14.618 --> 00:32:19.828
It was true also that Galen had
an encyclopedic knowledge,

00:32:19.828 --> 00:32:24.104
and we can only understand his
influence if we remember that he

00:32:24.104 --> 00:32:28.309
was a man of immense knowledge
of all branches of the medicine

00:32:28.309 --> 00:32:30.308
that existed at his time.
 

00:32:30.308 --> 00:32:33.695
And only half of his written
works survive,

00:32:33.695 --> 00:32:37.970
but they alone fill twelve
volumes of about a thousand

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:39.180
pages each.
 

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:42.095
In other words,
he was extraordinary in his

00:32:42.095 --> 00:32:44.940
productivity,
and that too is important on

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.190
his influence.
 

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:51.385
Now, Galen had a view that was
foreign to us of the meaning of

00:32:51.385 --> 00:32:53.259
scientific progress.
 

00:32:53.259 --> 00:32:57.519
To him Hippocrates was the
permanent foundation of medical

00:32:57.519 --> 00:33:01.855
science, and the main tenets of
that science could never be

00:33:01.855 --> 00:33:03.798
overturned or revised.
 

00:33:03.798 --> 00:33:08.798
Instead, there was no room in
his thinking for scientific

00:33:08.798 --> 00:33:10.048
revolutions.
 

00:33:10.048 --> 00:33:13.980
The writings of Hippocrates
were valid forever.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.380
They could only be completed
and perfected.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.363
And, in fact,
that was Galen's view of

00:33:20.363 --> 00:33:21.170
himself.
 

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:25.858
He was the person who perfected
Hippocratic ideas.

00:33:25.858 --> 00:33:29.476
So, in fact,
further progress was probably

00:33:29.476 --> 00:33:32.740
unnecessary and perhaps
impossible.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:38.080
So, Galen became the
authoritative interpreter of

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.640
Hippocrates.
 

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.210
This is what we might call
Galenism.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:47.047
And in his hands,
Hippocrates became a cult

00:33:47.047 --> 00:33:51.890
figure, an object of veneration
and almost worship.

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:55.323
Hippocrates,
about whom so little was known

00:33:55.323 --> 00:33:59.574
in his personal life,
was now endowed with all manner

00:33:59.574 --> 00:34:01.700
of apocryphal virtues.
 

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:06.720
He was idealized as a model of
wisdom, courage,

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.539
temperance, humanity and
honesty.

00:34:10.539 --> 00:34:14.175
Mythologies developed about his
religious piety,

00:34:14.175 --> 00:34:16.650
his heroism and his hard work.
 

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:21.400
There was a legend that he was
descended, on his father's side,

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:25.384
from the god Asclepius,
and on the maternal side from

00:34:25.384 --> 00:34:26.380
Hercules.
 

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:30.704
He was said to be a great
patriot who saved Athens from

00:34:30.704 --> 00:34:35.588
the plague, a man who scorned
money and was perfectly wise and

00:34:35.588 --> 00:34:37.110
perfectly just.
 

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:41.409
So, he became one of the
greatest cultural figures of

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:45.048
antiquity, an equivalent,
in a different way,

00:34:45.048 --> 00:34:48.110
of Socrates,
Plato and Aristotle.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:52.219
Now, probably some of you are
wondering--

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:56.150
we've talked about humoralism
and its advocates,

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:57.889
and you want to know,
"well,

00:34:57.889 --> 00:35:01.559
that's all very fine;
did it work?"

00:35:01.559 --> 00:35:06.469
I'd like to say that humoralism
had a number of strengths.

00:35:06.469 --> 00:35:12.407
It was a quantum leap from
magical thinking to naturalistic

00:35:12.407 --> 00:35:15.070
explanations of disease.
 

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:19.780
It appealed because it was
accessible to educated laymen.

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:23.706
Contemporaries with an
education understood everything

00:35:23.706 --> 00:35:28.079
that Hippocratic and Galenic
doctors said and prescribed.

00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:31.750
It was consonant with
contemporary understandings.

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:36.154
We also need to know that
Hippocratic and Galenic

00:35:36.154 --> 00:35:40.099
physicians practiced therapeutic
modesty.

00:35:40.099 --> 00:35:43.722
They did not participate in
surgery except,

00:35:43.722 --> 00:35:46.311
for example,
for setting bones,

00:35:46.311 --> 00:35:50.539
lancing abscesses and
practicing venesection;

00:35:50.539 --> 00:35:54.981
but the internal cavities of
the body they knew were off

00:35:54.981 --> 00:35:55.710
limits.
 

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.849
It was based on observation.
 

00:35:57.849 --> 00:36:00.320
They took case histories.
 

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.615
And we ought to remember,
in terms of medical

00:36:03.615 --> 00:36:05.976
effectiveness,
that--my wife,

00:36:05.976 --> 00:36:08.541
for example,
who is a primary care

00:36:08.541 --> 00:36:11.905
physician,
says that about seventy-five

00:36:11.905 --> 00:36:16.623
percent of patients who present
themselves in a clinic have

00:36:16.623 --> 00:36:20.539
self-limiting illnesses,
or psychosomatic ones,

00:36:20.539 --> 00:36:24.568
and mostly need reassurance
that everything will be all

00:36:24.568 --> 00:36:25.239
right.
 

00:36:25.239 --> 00:36:30.460
So, the point about Hippocratic
medicine was that experienced

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.387
physicians,
accustomed to seeing ill

00:36:33.387 --> 00:36:37.590
people, would be pretty good at
prognosis and reassurance.

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:41.389
They would refuse to treat
cases they regarded as hopeless,

00:36:41.389 --> 00:36:44.724
and hopeless cases,
they also had a referral

00:36:44.724 --> 00:36:46.884
system--
we'll refer to in a

00:36:46.884 --> 00:36:49.070
minute--which was to temples.
 

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:51.400
I'll come back to that in just
a second.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.739
There were, however,
a number of weaknesses.

00:36:54.739 --> 00:36:58.175
So, Hippocratic/Galenic
medicine had a number of

00:36:58.175 --> 00:36:59.710
powerful strengths.
 

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:03.909
It provided a lot in terms of
reassurance and prognosis,

00:37:03.909 --> 00:37:06.349
and the answer to that eternal
question,

00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:08.090
"Will I be all right
doc?"

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:10.958
and the other question,
"What can I do to help

00:37:10.958 --> 00:37:11.820
myself?"
 

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.489
There were a number of
weaknesses.

00:37:14.489 --> 00:37:16.030
It was a closed system.
 

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:20.795
It was based on deductive
reasoning, and came to be bound

00:37:20.795 --> 00:37:25.733
up in the authority of the
ancients, with empiricism fading

00:37:25.733 --> 00:37:28.518
away;
and indeed in later centuries

00:37:28.518 --> 00:37:32.139
it comes to be called
"library medicine."

00:37:32.139 --> 00:37:35.309
It was anchored in a cult of
personality--

00:37:35.309 --> 00:37:37.858
the cult of Galen,
and through him of

00:37:37.858 --> 00:37:40.876
Hippocrates--
and practiced a cult of

00:37:40.876 --> 00:37:45.893
antiquity, with knowledge almost
becoming a form of revealed

00:37:45.893 --> 00:37:46.659
truth.
 

00:37:46.659 --> 00:37:50.590
So, Galenism involved authority
and tradition,

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:54.594
an elite medicine of
university-trained physicians

00:37:54.594 --> 00:37:58.664
who were involved,
particularly in their training,

00:37:58.664 --> 00:38:00.639
in studying the classics.
 

00:38:00.639 --> 00:38:02.480
How do you train a physician?
 

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:07.454
You have them read Hippocrates
and Galen, in the original

00:38:07.454 --> 00:38:08.518
languages.
 

00:38:08.518 --> 00:38:11.958
I don't want to say,
however, that there were no

00:38:11.958 --> 00:38:12.909
challenges.
 

00:38:12.909 --> 00:38:16.295
It's extraordinary to reflect
that humoralism,

00:38:16.295 --> 00:38:20.059
as a dominant medical
philosophy, persists into the

00:38:20.059 --> 00:38:21.789
nineteenth century.
 

00:38:21.789 --> 00:38:24.829
But I don't want to think that
it was unchallenged.

00:38:24.829 --> 00:38:29.378
We know there were demonic and
religious views that ran

00:38:29.378 --> 00:38:30.389
alongside.
 

00:38:30.389 --> 00:38:33.376
But in addition,
there were a series of

00:38:33.376 --> 00:38:37.702
scientific challenges that
occurred in a number of major

00:38:37.702 --> 00:38:42.655
shocks to the system that slowly
weakened its hold and gave rise

00:38:42.655 --> 00:38:45.768
to doubters,
but did not thoroughly

00:38:45.768 --> 00:38:49.889
dismantle humoralism until the
late nineteenth century;

00:38:49.889 --> 00:38:54.695
and even then it persists in
popular culture and some forms

00:38:54.695 --> 00:38:56.849
of alternative medicine.
 

00:38:56.849 --> 00:38:58.760
What were some of these
challenges?

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.000
I don't expect you to remember
these at this point;

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.699
we'll come back to them later
in the course.

00:39:04.699 --> 00:39:07.940
But just so that you'll
understand that it wasn't as

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.610
though this system never had
challenges.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:16.132
Protestantism was a challenge,
with a challenge to authority

00:39:16.132 --> 00:39:18.380
and established texts.
 

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:21.846
And Paracelsus,
whose dates are on your

00:39:21.846 --> 00:39:25.188
handout,
was called the Martin Luther of

00:39:25.188 --> 00:39:28.289
medicine,
who rejected Galenic and

00:39:28.289 --> 00:39:31.599
Hippocratic medicine all
together.

00:39:31.599 --> 00:39:37.460
William Harvey discovered the
circulation of the blood,

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:40.934
which overthrew or challenged
Galen's anatomy and his

00:39:40.934 --> 00:39:44.342
physiology,
which were proved not to

00:39:44.342 --> 00:39:49.599
correspond to the observed
results of dissection and

00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:50.940
pathology.
 

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:54.469
So, the discovery of the
circulation of the blood was a

00:39:54.469 --> 00:39:58.032
major blow;
although, oddly enough Harvey

00:39:58.032 --> 00:40:02.617
himself never rejected
humoralism, Hippocrates and

00:40:02.617 --> 00:40:03.460
Galen.
 

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:05.829
Then there was the scientific
revolution.

00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:10.067
And in particular one can think
of the chemical revolution

00:40:10.067 --> 00:40:14.900
associated with men like Joseph
Priestly and Antoine Lavoisier.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:20.170
They destroyed the Aristotelian
notion of elements.

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:22.045
Earth and air,
for example,

00:40:22.045 --> 00:40:26.083
were found themselves to be
composed of a great number of

00:40:26.083 --> 00:40:30.554
modern elements that go to make
up what we know as the periodic

00:40:30.554 --> 00:40:31.420
table.
 

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:35.056
And more generally,
the scientific revolution

00:40:35.056 --> 00:40:40.429
marked a democratic turn from
authority to empirical evidence,

00:40:40.429 --> 00:40:44.793
and it envisioned scientific
and medical knowledge as

00:40:44.793 --> 00:40:49.239
infinitely expandable and not
bounded by set texts.

00:40:49.239 --> 00:40:51.949
And then, from the point of
view of our course,

00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:54.380
the experience of epidemic
disease,

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.639
as we'll see,
made the idea of dyscrasia

00:40:57.639 --> 00:41:02.989
improbable as a mechanism needed
to explain epidemic disease,

00:41:02.989 --> 00:41:07.994
because it's fairly flimsy as a
basis for explaining why so many

00:41:07.994 --> 00:41:10.117
people,
in a single place,

00:41:10.117 --> 00:41:14.532
at a single moment of time,
had their equilibria all

00:41:14.532 --> 00:41:17.469
unbalanced at the same moment.
 

00:41:17.469 --> 00:41:21.469
So, the experience of epidemic
disease is important,

00:41:21.469 --> 00:41:24.909
and we'll see the physician,
Fracastoro,

00:41:24.909 --> 00:41:29.409
came up with the idea of
contagionism many centuries ago.

00:41:29.409 --> 00:41:33.757
In the nineteenth century we'll
see also, with the development

00:41:33.757 --> 00:41:36.039
of pathology,
the idea of disease

00:41:36.039 --> 00:41:38.940
specificity;
and finally in the late

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:42.384
nineteenth century the germ
theory of disease,

00:41:42.384 --> 00:41:46.900
which offers an entirely
different paradigm for disease.

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.699
So, that's the journey we'll be
taking,

00:41:49.699 --> 00:41:53.000
to the time when humoralism is
replaced,

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.030
and we'll look at various
embodiments along the way of

00:41:57.030 --> 00:42:00.909
what people considered to be
scientific medicine.

00:42:00.909 --> 00:42:05.623
But here a number of you will
be thinking that I've involved

00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:08.820
myself in an important
contradiction,

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:14.797
and you'll be thinking about
Asclepius and the fact that I

00:42:14.797 --> 00:42:18.260
talked about temples and a god.
 

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:26.592
And in particular let's look
at--that's the god Asclepius,

00:42:26.592 --> 00:42:33.170
and this is the--I'll talk
about who he is.

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:37.579
Hippocrates and Galen were both
pious and devout;

00:42:37.579 --> 00:42:40.512
that is to say,
although they believed in a

00:42:40.512 --> 00:42:44.851
naturalistic medicine,
it wasn't that they didn't also

00:42:44.851 --> 00:42:49.043
believe in the gods,
and through the gods they found

00:42:49.043 --> 00:42:53.829
in temple medicine what we might
call the world's first referral

00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:54.590
system.
 

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:57.030
Asclepius, who was he?
 

00:42:57.030 --> 00:43:02.313
He was first a moral hero who
became half human and half

00:43:02.313 --> 00:43:05.579
divine, and then entirely a god.
 

00:43:05.579 --> 00:43:08.809
He was thought to be the
kindest of the gods;

00:43:08.809 --> 00:43:13.646
the one who loved humanity
enough to sacrifice himself for

00:43:13.646 --> 00:43:14.750
their sake.
 

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:17.630
His father was the god Apollo.
 

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:21.824
His daughters were
interestingly named the

00:43:21.824 --> 00:43:25.099
goddesses Panacea and Hygieia.
 

00:43:25.099 --> 00:43:29.528
And physicians in the ancient
world might call themselves

00:43:29.528 --> 00:43:34.275
Asclepiads, meaning the sons of
Asclepius, who regarded their

00:43:34.275 --> 00:43:36.570
father as a patron saint.
 

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:41.539
By the time of Alexander the
Great, Greece possessed three to

00:43:41.539 --> 00:43:45.349
four hundred temples dedicated
to Asclepius.

00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:50.501
Asclepius was said to have been
killed by Zeus because he taught

00:43:50.501 --> 00:43:55.407
mortals the art of healing and
Zeus feared that men and women

00:43:55.407 --> 00:44:00.559
would compete with him in no
longer being subject to death.

00:44:00.559 --> 00:44:04.210
But Asclepius never practiced
magic.

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:08.240
He was merely the most skilled
of physicians,

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:13.922
using the same principles that
Asclepiads, like Hippocrates and

00:44:13.922 --> 00:44:16.579
Galen, would use as well.
 

00:44:16.579 --> 00:44:19.793
Note, of course,
there are similarities to the

00:44:19.793 --> 00:44:23.378
story of Christ,
and Asclepius was in fact a

00:44:23.378 --> 00:44:27.425
major competitor with
Christianity for a number of

00:44:27.425 --> 00:44:28.500
centuries.
 

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:32.172
And like Christ,
after death he was said to have

00:44:32.172 --> 00:44:36.159
risen and to be present
eternally in the temples.

00:44:36.159 --> 00:44:40.880
So, the temples were shrines to
Asclepius, at places like

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:41.639
Athens.
 

00:44:41.639 --> 00:44:44.570
I'll show you,
I hope, a couple of examples.

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:49.250
That's Chios,
where Hippocrates was from,

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:53.579
and this is the temple at
Pergamon.

00:44:53.579 --> 00:44:56.951
I just want to--there,
it's a whole--this is more than

00:44:56.951 --> 00:44:59.559
just a temple,
although it is a temple.

00:44:59.559 --> 00:45:02.530
It's almost a compound.
 

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:06.373
Now, the usefulness of
identifying yourself with

00:45:06.373 --> 00:45:11.608
Asclepius was that there was--it
provided physicians with a badge

00:45:11.608 --> 00:45:14.800
of identity, a source of
authority.

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:19.032
They were wandering peripatetic
healers, but now they're

00:45:19.032 --> 00:45:22.420
recognizable as members of the
same guild.

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:26.181
This gave them a collective
presence and authority,

00:45:26.181 --> 00:45:30.320
and Asclepius also vouched for
their ethical conduct.

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.981
Remember, these are peripatetic
physicians whom you invite into

00:45:33.981 --> 00:45:34.690
your home.
 

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:38.630
And, so, they needed to have
someone vouch for them,

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:42.835
and he vouches that they're
good doctors and that they have

00:45:42.835 --> 00:45:46.170
special care for the poor who
can't pay him.

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:50.434
But again, there is no
contradiction with naturalistic

00:45:50.434 --> 00:45:51.320
medicine.
 

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:56.483
The temples were precursors,
in a way, to health spas,

00:45:56.483 --> 00:45:58.920
sanatoria or hospitals.
 

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:03.659
There they provided care for
the poor and the seriously ill.

00:46:03.659 --> 00:46:07.489
Patients could enter them,
the precincts of these

00:46:07.489 --> 00:46:11.719
compounds, after a period of
preparation in which they

00:46:11.719 --> 00:46:15.630
bathed, fasted,
prayed and offered sacrifice.

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:19.184
But the therapeutic strategy
comes to them in a particular

00:46:19.184 --> 00:46:22.239
way, which is called an
"incubation";

00:46:22.239 --> 00:46:26.981
which is to say that at night,
after you've prepared yourself

00:46:26.981 --> 00:46:29.782
carefully,
in the way I just mentioned,

00:46:29.782 --> 00:46:32.382
when you--
then the priest will help

00:46:32.382 --> 00:46:36.949
you--and when you fall asleep at
night you'll have a dream.

00:46:36.949 --> 00:46:41.489
This is the incubation,
and the god Asclepius will

00:46:41.489 --> 00:46:46.956
appear to you and tell you the
strategy you should pursue in

00:46:46.956 --> 00:46:49.829
order to become well again.
 

00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:54.702
But the strategy was nothing
other than what a skilled

00:46:54.702 --> 00:47:00.311
physician would have prescribed,
had he been skillful and wise

00:47:00.311 --> 00:47:02.610
enough to have known.
 

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:06.722
There was never a treatment
prescribed by Asclepius by

00:47:06.722 --> 00:47:10.911
magical means or miracles,
or by practices that weren't

00:47:10.911 --> 00:47:13.860
accessible to the ordinary
doctor.

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:18.264
So, this is humoral medicine,
the first embodiment of

00:47:18.264 --> 00:47:20.130
scientific medicine.
 

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:24.268
And I want us to look,
for the next several sessions,

00:47:24.268 --> 00:47:30.239
at the way in which it was used
as a lens to view the experience

00:47:30.239 --> 00:47:33.650
of terrible epidemic
catastrophes.

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:38.342
And we'll look also at the way
in which the experience of

00:47:38.342 --> 00:47:42.869
bubonic plague and other
epidemics challenged or raised

00:47:42.869 --> 00:47:46.389
major questions about humoral
theory,

00:47:46.389 --> 00:47:50.907
and helped propel the
scientific medical elite towards

00:47:50.907 --> 00:47:54.829
a different view of disease and
what it was.

00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:58.490
So, we'll see epidemics,
beginning next time,

00:47:58.490 --> 00:47:59.739
as a process.
 

00:47:59.739 --> 00:48:04.793
And we'll also want then to
explain it, and we'll look at

00:48:04.793 --> 00:48:09.847
bubonic plague as the first of
our major epidemics in our

00:48:09.847 --> 00:48:10.840
course.
 

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:16.000

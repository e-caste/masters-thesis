00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.737
Professor Shelly Kagan:
All right, so this is Philosophy

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:07.480
176.
The class is on death.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.462
My name is Shelly Kagan.
The very first thing I want to

00:00:12.462 --> 00:00:16.210
do is to invite you to call me
Shelly.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.903
That is, if we meet on the
street, you come talk to me

00:00:18.903 --> 00:00:21.190
during office hours,
you ask some question;

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.880
Shelly's the name that I
respond to.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.455
I will, eventually,
respond to Professor Kagan,

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:31.030
but the synapses take a bit
longer for that.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.190
It's not the name I immediately
recognize.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.543
I have found that over the
years, fewer and fewer students

00:00:37.543 --> 00:00:39.720
feel comfortable calling me
Shelly.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.900
When I was young,
it seemed to work.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:48.624
Now I'm gray and august.
But if you're comfortable with

00:00:48.624 --> 00:00:52.110
it, it's the name that I prefer
to be called by.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.210
Now, as I say,
this is a class on death.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.124
But it's a philosophy class,
and what that means is that the

00:00:59.124 --> 00:01:02.905
set of topics that we're going
to be talking about in this

00:01:02.905 --> 00:01:06.753
class are not identical to the
topics that other classes on

00:01:06.753 --> 00:01:11.160
death might try to cover.
So the first thing I want to do

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.557
is say something about the
things we won't be talking about

00:01:15.557 --> 00:01:20.182
that you might reasonably expect
or hope that a class on death

00:01:20.182 --> 00:01:23.831
would talk about,
so that if this is not the

00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:28.251
class you were looking for,
you still have time to go check

00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:31.836
out some other class.
So here are some things that a

00:01:31.836 --> 00:01:34.940
class on death could cover that
we won't talk about.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.767
What I primarily have in mind
are sort of psychological and

00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:41.934
sociological questions about the
nature of death,

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:46.682
or the phenomenon of death.
So, a class on death might well

00:01:46.682 --> 00:01:52.263
have a discussion of the process
of dying and coming to reconcile

00:01:52.263 --> 00:01:56.709
yourself with the fact that
you're going to die.

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.154
Some of you may know about
Elisabeth KÃ¼bler-Ross'

00:02:00.154 --> 00:02:03.739
discussion of the so-called five
stages of dying.

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:06.014
There's denial,
and then there's anger,

00:02:06.014 --> 00:02:09.025
and then there's bargaining.
I actually don't remember the

00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:11.765
five stages.
We're not going to talk about

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:14.771
that.
Similarly, we're not going to

00:02:14.771 --> 00:02:20.139
talk about the funeral industry
in America and how it rips off

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.991
people,
which it does,

00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:26.015
in their moments of grief and
weakness and overcharges them

00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:28.860
for the various things that it
offers.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.419
We're not going to talk about
that.

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:35.274
We're not going to talk about
the process of grieving or

00:02:35.274 --> 00:02:39.170
bereavement.
We're not going to talk about

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.582
sociological attitudes that we
have towards the dying in our

00:02:44.582 --> 00:02:49.995
culture and how we tend to try
to keep the dying hidden from

00:02:49.995 --> 00:02:53.400
the rest of us.
These are all perfectly

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.652
important topics,
but they're not,

00:02:55.652 --> 00:02:59.407
as I say, topics that we're
going to be talking about in

00:02:59.407 --> 00:03:02.449
this class.
So what will we talk about?

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:06.995
Well, the things we'll talk
about are philosophical

00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:12.450
questions that arise as we begin
to think about the nature of

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.900
death.
Like this.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.860
In broad scope,
the first half of the class is

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.018
going to be metaphysics,
for those of you who are

00:03:21.018 --> 00:03:24.439
familiar with the philosophical
piece of jargon.

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:27.658
And roughly,
the second half of the class is

00:03:27.658 --> 00:03:31.831
going to be value theory.
So, the first half of the class

00:03:31.831 --> 00:03:35.855
is going to be concerned with
questions about the nature of

00:03:35.855 --> 00:03:39.520
death.
What happens when we die?

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.180
Indeed, to get at that
question, the first thing we're

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.490
going to have to think about is
what are we?

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.650
What kind of an entity is a
person?

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.553
In particular,
do we have souls,

00:03:50.553 --> 00:03:53.194
and for this class when I talk
about a soul,

00:03:53.194 --> 00:03:56.571
what I'm going to mean is sort
of a bit of philosophical

00:03:56.571 --> 00:03:58.860
jargon.
I'm going to mean something

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.509
immaterial, something distinct
from our bodies.

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:06.186
Do we have immaterial souls,
something that might survive

00:04:06.186 --> 00:04:09.754
the death of our body?
And if not, what does that

00:04:09.754 --> 00:04:15.250
imply about the nature of death?
What kind of an event is death?

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.713
What is it for me to survive?
What would it mean for me to

00:04:18.713 --> 00:04:21.284
survive my death?
What does it mean for me to

00:04:21.284 --> 00:04:23.504
survive tonight?
That is, you know,

00:04:23.504 --> 00:04:26.639
somebody's going to be here
lecturing to the class on

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.050
Thursday, presumably that will
be me.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.558
What is it for that person
who's there on Thursday to be

00:04:32.558 --> 00:04:36.386
the same person as the person
who's sitting here lecturing to

00:04:36.386 --> 00:04:38.639
you today?
These are questions about the

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.775
nature of personal identity.
Pretty clearly,

00:04:40.775 --> 00:04:43.206
to think about death and
continued existence and

00:04:43.206 --> 00:04:46.205
survival, we have to get clear
about the nature of personal

00:04:46.205 --> 00:04:49.585
identity.
These sorts of questions will

00:04:49.585 --> 00:04:54.529
occupy us for roughly the first
half of the semester.

00:04:54.529 --> 00:05:00.089
And then we'll turn to value
questions.

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:04.160
If death is the end,
is death bad?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.945
Now, of course,
most of us are immediately and

00:05:05.945 --> 00:05:07.810
strongly inclined to think that
death is bad.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.620
But there are a set of
philosophical puzzles about how

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.509
death could be bad.
To sort of give you a quick

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:21.148
taste, if after my death I won't
exist, how could anything be bad

00:05:21.148 --> 00:05:24.055
for me?
How could anything be bad for

00:05:24.055 --> 00:05:28.350
something that doesn't exist?
So how could death be bad?

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.611
So it's not that the result is
going to be that I'm going to

00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:32.259
try to convince you that death
isn't bad,

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:35.151
but it takes actually a little
bit of work to pin down

00:05:35.151 --> 00:05:38.424
precisely what is it about death
that's bad and how can it be

00:05:38.424 --> 00:05:40.934
death?
Is there more than one thing

00:05:40.934 --> 00:05:44.353
about death that makes it bad?
We'll turn to questions like

00:05:44.353 --> 00:05:45.472
that.
If death is bad,

00:05:45.472 --> 00:05:48.509
then one might wonder would
immortality be a good thing?

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:50.310
That's a question that we'll
think about.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.226
Or, more generally,
we'll worry about how should

00:05:54.226 --> 00:05:58.810
the fact that I'm going to die
affect the way I live?

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.240
What should my attitude be
towards my mortality?

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.949
Should I be afraid of death,
for example?

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.550
Should I despair at the fact
that I'm going to die?

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.240
Finally, we'll turn to
questions about suicide.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.104
Many of us think that given the
valuable and precious thing that

00:06:19.104 --> 00:06:22.630
life is, suicide makes no sense.
You're throwing away the only

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.002
life you're ever going to have.
And so we'll end the semester

00:06:26.002 --> 00:06:29.013
by thinking about questions
along the lines of the

00:06:29.013 --> 00:06:31.410
rationality and morality of
suicide.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.550
So roughly speaking,
that's where we're going.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.220
First half of the class,
metaphysics;

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.800
second half of the class,
value theory.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.769
Next thing I need to explain is
this.

00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:44.679
There's, roughly speaking,
two ways to do a class,

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:48.269
especially an introductory
class like this.

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:53.445
In approach number one,
you simply lay out the various

00:06:53.445 --> 00:06:58.424
positions, pro and con,
and the professor strives to

00:06:58.424 --> 00:07:02.573
remain neutral;
sort of not tip his hand about

00:07:02.573 --> 00:07:05.079
what he holds.
That's approach number one.

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:08.223
And sometimes in my intro
classes that's the approach that

00:07:08.223 --> 00:07:10.052
I take.
But the other approach,

00:07:10.052 --> 00:07:13.298
and the one that I should warn
you I'm going to take this

00:07:13.298 --> 00:07:16.079
semester, in this class,
is rather different.

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:20.210
There's a line that I'm going
to be developing,

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.790
pushing, if you will,
or defending in this class.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.677
That is to say,
there's a certain set of views

00:07:27.677 --> 00:07:30.949
I hold about the issues that
we'll be discussing.

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:34.206
And what I'm going to try to do
in this class is argue for those

00:07:34.206 --> 00:07:36.487
views.
Try to convince you that those

00:07:36.487 --> 00:07:37.670
views are correct.

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:46.323
To help you know sort of ahead
of time quickly what those views

00:07:46.323 --> 00:07:49.951
are, I want to start by
describing a set of views that

00:07:49.951 --> 00:07:53.421
many of you probably believe.
So I'm going to give you a

00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:55.152
cluster of views.
Logically speaking,

00:07:55.152 --> 00:07:57.970
you could believe some of these
things and not all of them.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.354
But here's a set of views that
many of you probably believe,

00:08:01.354 --> 00:08:04.509
and I imagine most of you
believe at least some of these

00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:07.101
things.
So here's the set of common

00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:08.619
views.
First of all,

00:08:08.619 --> 00:08:12.752
that we have a soul.
That is to say we are not just

00:08:12.752 --> 00:08:15.882
bodies.
We're not just lumps of bone

00:08:15.882 --> 00:08:18.389
and flesh.
But there's a part of us,

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:22.084
perhaps the essential part of
us, that is something more than

00:08:22.084 --> 00:08:24.038
the physical,
the spiritual,

00:08:24.038 --> 00:08:27.497
immaterial part of us,
which as I say in this class

00:08:27.497 --> 00:08:30.535
we'll call a soul.
Most of us, most of you,

00:08:30.535 --> 00:08:33.815
probably believe in souls.
Certainly most people in

00:08:33.815 --> 00:08:36.870
America believe in some sort of
immaterial soul.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:40.927
And given this existence of
this immaterial soul,

00:08:40.927 --> 00:08:44.646
it's a possibility,
indeed a fair likelihood,

00:08:44.646 --> 00:08:47.690
that we will survive our
deaths.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.791
The death will be the
destruction of my body,

00:08:50.791 --> 00:08:55.090
but my soul is immaterial and
so my soul can continue to exist

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:59.280
after my death.
And whether or not you actually

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.786
believe in a soul,
you hope that there's a soul so

00:09:03.786 --> 00:09:09.119
that there'll be this serious
possibility of surviving your

00:09:09.119 --> 00:09:12.889
death because death is not only
bad,

00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:16.822
but so horrible that what we
would like to have happen is,

00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:20.721
we would like to live forever.
And so, armed with a soul,

00:09:20.721 --> 00:09:24.690
as it were, there's at least
the possibility of immortality.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.624
Immortality would be wonderful.
That's what we hope is the

00:09:28.624 --> 00:09:32.100
case, whether or not we know
that it's the case.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.290
Immortality would be wonderful.
That's why death's so bad.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:39.741
It robs us of immortality.
And if there is no soul,

00:09:39.741 --> 00:09:44.248
if death is the end,
if there is no immortality,

00:09:44.248 --> 00:09:49.809
this is such an overwhelmingly
bad thing that the only,

00:09:49.809 --> 00:09:53.552
the obvious reaction,
the natural reaction,

00:09:53.552 --> 00:09:57.918
the universal reaction,
is to face the prospect of

00:09:57.918 --> 00:10:03.003
death with fear and despair.
And as I mentioned earlier

00:10:03.003 --> 00:10:07.986
then, death is so horrible and
life is so wonderful that it

00:10:07.986 --> 00:10:11.679
could never make sense to throw
it away.

00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:16.467
So suicide is both immoral on
the one hand and never makes

00:10:16.467 --> 00:10:19.824
sense.
It's always irrational as well,

00:10:19.824 --> 00:10:22.427
in addition.
That, as I say,

00:10:22.427 --> 00:10:28.340
is I think a common set of
views about the nature of death.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.809
And what I'm going to be doing,
what I'm going to be arguing in

00:10:32.809 --> 00:10:37.135
this class, is that that set of
views is pretty much mistaken

00:10:37.135 --> 00:10:40.913
from beginning to end.
And so I'm going to try to

00:10:40.913 --> 00:10:43.549
convince you that there is no
soul.

00:10:43.549 --> 00:10:45.830
Immortality would not be a good
thing.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:50.029
Fear of death isn't actually an
appropriate response to death.

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:52.014
Suicide, under certain
circumstances,

00:10:52.014 --> 00:10:54.440
might be rationally and morally
justified.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.814
As I say, the common picture is
pretty much mistaken from start

00:10:58.814 --> 00:11:01.000
to end.
That's at least my goal.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.470
That's my aim.
That's what I'm going to be

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.271
doing.
Now, since of course,

00:11:05.271 --> 00:11:08.795
I believe the views I
believe--and I hope at the end

00:11:08.795 --> 00:11:11.559
of the semester you'll agree
with me,

00:11:11.559 --> 00:11:13.291
because I think they're true
and I hope you'll end up

00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:16.189
believing the truth [laughter].
But I should say that the

00:11:16.189 --> 00:11:19.500
crucial point isn't for you to
agree with me.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.710
The crucial point is for you to
think for yourself.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:30.645
And so what I'm really doing is
inviting you to take a good,

00:11:30.645 --> 00:11:37.128
cold, hard look at death,
and to face it and think about

00:11:37.128 --> 00:11:41.320
it in a way that most of us
don't do.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.777
If you, at the end of the
semester, haven't agreed with me

00:11:44.777 --> 00:11:47.931
about this particular claim or
that particular claim,

00:11:47.931 --> 00:11:50.671
so be it.
I'll be content--I won't be

00:11:50.671 --> 00:11:55.223
completely content--but I'll be
at least largely content as long

00:11:55.223 --> 00:11:59.631
as you've really thought through
the arguments on each side of

00:11:59.631 --> 00:12:03.481
these various issues.
Karen, maybe this would be a

00:12:03.481 --> 00:12:06.789
good time for you to pass around
the syllabus.

00:12:06.789 --> 00:12:09.506
Next introductory remark:
A lot of today's talk is going

00:12:09.506 --> 00:12:11.854
to be devoted to business.
I'll get to,

00:12:11.854 --> 00:12:15.470
if time permits,
some philosophy at the end.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.269
I want to make one more remark
about what I'll be doing in

00:12:18.269 --> 00:12:20.399
terms of this class.
This class, as I say,

00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:24.129
is a philosophy class.
We'll basically be sitting here

00:12:24.129 --> 00:12:29.288
thinking about what we can know
or make sense of with regard to

00:12:29.288 --> 00:12:32.450
death using our reasoning
capacity.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:36.362
We'll be trying to think about
death from a rational

00:12:36.362 --> 00:12:39.858
standpoint.
One kind of evidence or one

00:12:39.858 --> 00:12:45.503
kind of argument that we won't
be making use of here is appeal

00:12:45.503 --> 00:12:49.738
to religious authority.
So some of you may believe in,

00:12:49.738 --> 00:12:52.419
for example,
the existence of an afterlife.

00:12:52.419 --> 00:12:54.740
You may believe you're going to
survive your death.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.505
You may believe in immortality
because that's what your church

00:12:58.505 --> 00:13:01.580
teaches you.
And that's fine.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.307
It's not my purpose or
intention here to try to argue

00:13:05.307 --> 00:13:09.393
you out of your religious
beliefs or to argue against your

00:13:09.393 --> 00:13:13.228
religious beliefs.
All I'm going to ask is that we

00:13:13.228 --> 00:13:17.526
not appeal to such religious
arguments, appeal to revelation

00:13:17.526 --> 00:13:21.376
or the authority of the Bible,
or what have you,

00:13:21.376 --> 00:13:26.500
in the course of this argument.
In the course of this class.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.586
If you want to,
you could think of this class

00:13:29.586 --> 00:13:34.102
as one big hypothetical.
What conclusions would we come

00:13:34.102 --> 00:13:39.666
to about the nature of death if
we had to think about it from a

00:13:39.666 --> 00:13:44.078
secular perspective?
Making use of only our own

00:13:44.078 --> 00:13:48.776
reasoning, as opposed to
whatever answers we might be

00:13:48.776 --> 00:13:52.210
given by divine revealed
authority.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.761
Those of you who believe in
divine revealed authority,

00:13:55.761 --> 00:13:58.039
that's a debate for another
day.

00:13:58.039 --> 00:14:01.708
It's not a debate that we're
going to be engaged in here in

00:14:01.708 --> 00:14:04.565
this semester.
Similarly, although I'm not

00:14:04.565 --> 00:14:08.391
going to ask you in your
discussion sections to hide your

00:14:08.391 --> 00:14:11.717
religious views,
you'll be asked in the course

00:14:11.717 --> 00:14:15.142
of defending them,
to give reasons that would make

00:14:15.142 --> 00:14:16.680
sense to all of us.

00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:22.590
That's by way of sort of where
the class is going.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.852
Let me now turn to some
discussion about the

00:14:25.852 --> 00:14:30.330
requirements of the class,
grades and so forth and so on.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.049
The syllabus is going around
the class.

00:14:34.049 --> 00:14:36.200
Almost all of you have it at
this point.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.539
The syllabus doesn't really say
a whole lot.

00:14:38.539 --> 00:14:41.012
I've already given you an
overview of what topics we'll be

00:14:41.012 --> 00:14:43.510
going to.
The crucial point about the

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:47.849
syllabus is that it indicates
what reading you need to have

00:14:47.849 --> 00:14:52.413
done for any given week.
Now, I've done my best to peg

00:14:52.413 --> 00:14:57.149
the readings to where I will be
on that week's lecture,

00:14:57.149 --> 00:15:00.482
but I don't lecture with
lecture notes,

00:15:00.482 --> 00:15:03.794
for the most part.
Sometimes I take a little bit

00:15:03.794 --> 00:15:06.705
longer than I anticipated.
Actually, I often take a little

00:15:06.705 --> 00:15:09.888
bit longer than I anticipated.
No doubt at some point I'll

00:15:09.888 --> 00:15:11.887
fall behind.
At some point I may rush to

00:15:11.887 --> 00:15:14.267
catch up ahead.
It won't always be the case

00:15:14.267 --> 00:15:17.981
that the readings will exactly
coincide with where the lectures

00:15:17.981 --> 00:15:19.503
are at.
Nonetheless,

00:15:19.503 --> 00:15:22.965
in any given week,
for the start of that week,

00:15:22.965 --> 00:15:26.965
you should have done the
readings that are listed for

00:15:26.965 --> 00:15:30.530
that week.
The readings on the syllabus

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:35.092
simply say the author,
and there are a couple of books

00:15:35.092 --> 00:15:38.450
that are available at the
bookstore.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:43.229
There are a larger packet of
readings that's available as a

00:15:43.229 --> 00:15:47.274
course pack at Tyco's .
And so for any given week you

00:15:47.274 --> 00:15:49.871
can find the reading.
One or two cases,

00:15:49.871 --> 00:15:53.210
maybe just one actually,
where I've got more than one

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:56.741
article by the given author,
I've given the title of the

00:15:56.741 --> 00:15:59.314
article as well.
It shouldn't be difficult to

00:15:59.314 --> 00:16:01.019
locate the reading for any given
week.

00:16:01.019 --> 00:16:04.245
The format of the class,
of course, is a familiar and

00:16:04.245 --> 00:16:08.432
straightforward one.
I'll be sitting here lecturing

00:16:08.432 --> 00:16:12.289
twice a week,
this time, 10:30 to 11:20.

00:16:12.289 --> 00:16:16.500
Once a week you will break up
into discussion sections.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.139
The discussion sections will
meet for 50 minutes.

00:16:19.139 --> 00:16:22.409
Each one of you will have a
single time.

00:16:22.409 --> 00:16:26.440
But it'll be different times
the discussion sections meet.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.114
For the first time,
the philosophy department has

00:16:30.114 --> 00:16:34.937
just switched over to the online
discussion section registration

00:16:34.937 --> 00:16:37.383
system.
I'm not 100% certain how that

00:16:37.383 --> 00:16:39.789
works.
I've not used it before.

00:16:39.789 --> 00:16:42.490
I take it the idea is something
like this.

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:47.403
Right now, if you were to shop
the class, you could find the

00:16:47.403 --> 00:16:51.899
tentative list of discussion
section days and times.

00:16:51.899 --> 00:16:54.940
So be sure to find some time
that works for you.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:17:00.084
You can't actually register for
any of those discussion section

00:17:00.084 --> 00:17:02.543
times yet.
But as of, I think,

00:17:02.543 --> 00:17:07.319
next week when you're able to
begin your online registration,

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:11.533
you will be able to register
for any discussion section that

00:17:11.533 --> 00:17:16.069
still has a slot,
still has a space open in it.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:21.352
In fact, you won't be able to
finalize your registration for

00:17:21.352 --> 00:17:25.828
your courses until you've
actually signed up for an

00:17:25.828 --> 00:17:29.055
available slot.
Once you have registered,

00:17:29.055 --> 00:17:31.985
if some other slots become
available that weren't

00:17:31.985 --> 00:17:34.794
previously available,
I gather you'll be sent some

00:17:34.794 --> 00:17:37.531
sort of email by the system,
in case some other time would

00:17:37.531 --> 00:17:40.169
be better for you.
You can put yourself on waiting

00:17:40.169 --> 00:17:45.080
lists and so forth.
It sounds pretty good on paper.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.026
Maybe it'll all work smoothly.
I've never been through it

00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:49.640
before.
I hope we won't have any

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.823
problems.
Right now what you want to make

00:17:51.823 --> 00:17:54.970
sure is that there is a time
that's available--right now all

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:58.116
the times are available--but
that there is a time that works

00:17:58.116 --> 00:18:00.481
for you.
Because if you can't find a

00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:04.071
discussion section that works
for you, you won't be able to

00:18:04.071 --> 00:18:08.549
take this course.
Any questions about that?

00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:11.876
I should actually ask,
any questions about anything

00:18:11.876 --> 00:18:15.269
that I've asked or said so far,
up to this point?

00:18:15.269 --> 00:18:18.487
Let me make a remark about
questions, which is--today's

00:18:18.487 --> 00:18:20.787
mostly business.
Hopefully, it'll be fairly

00:18:20.787 --> 00:18:23.788
straightforward.
But both today and throughout

00:18:23.788 --> 00:18:27.276
the entire semester,
as I'm lecturing I want to

00:18:27.276 --> 00:18:30.309
invite you to jump in with
questions.

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:31.630
Well, jump in is a bit of an
exaggeration.

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:36.099
I don't want you to just start
talking, but raise your hand.

00:18:36.099 --> 00:18:39.946
If I'm saying something that
you don't understand,

00:18:39.946 --> 00:18:44.185
the chances are pretty good
that there's 25 or 50 other

00:18:44.185 --> 00:18:48.660
students in the class who don't
understand it either.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:52.687
I'm just not being clear.
So I want to welcome you,

00:18:52.687 --> 00:18:56.383
I really want to invite you,
whenever you've got some

00:18:56.383 --> 00:18:59.440
reactions to the things that I'm
saying,

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.069
raise your hand,
I'll call on you.

00:19:01.069 --> 00:19:02.378
Say, "Shelly,
I didn't really understand what

00:19:02.378 --> 00:19:04.676
you were saying about the soul.
Could you please explain that

00:19:04.676 --> 00:19:06.381
again?"
Or, for that matter,

00:19:06.381 --> 00:19:09.601
if you've got some quick
reactions or thoughts or

00:19:09.601 --> 00:19:13.692
responses to the arguments that
I'm laying out and you want to

00:19:13.692 --> 00:19:16.509
share them with the class as a
whole,

00:19:16.509 --> 00:19:18.559
then very much I want to invite
you to do this.

00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:22.133
Now this class is too big for
us to have some close,

00:19:22.133 --> 00:19:25.917
intimate conversation between
the 150-180, however many

00:19:25.917 --> 00:19:30.200
students there are here.
That's not going to happen.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.302
But the chance for detailed
discussion in the discussion

00:19:34.302 --> 00:19:37.509
section, that's where that
should happen.

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:40.558
But still, there is the chance
for brief reactions and

00:19:40.558 --> 00:19:42.630
definitely a chance for
questions.

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.509
I very much want to invite you
to do that.

00:19:44.509 --> 00:19:47.312
So, if at any point you've got
something you want to ask about

00:19:47.312 --> 00:19:48.920
or some two bits you want to
add,

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.182
raise your hand,
wiggle it around,

00:19:51.182 --> 00:19:54.147
make sure I see you.
I may want to finish the

00:19:54.147 --> 00:19:57.365
particular point that I'm
making, but I'll try to come

00:19:57.365 --> 00:20:00.339
back to you and I'll then raise
your question.

00:20:00.339 --> 00:20:04.590
And if I remember at least,
I will repeat the question out

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:07.349
loud so that everybody can hear
it.

00:20:07.349 --> 00:20:12.848
I also want to say that I will
try to have the practice of,

00:20:12.848 --> 00:20:16.061
after class ends,
if you want to continue the

00:20:16.061 --> 00:20:18.936
discussion, you have some
questions that occurred to you

00:20:18.936 --> 00:20:21.574
towards the end,
we didn't have a chance to

00:20:21.574 --> 00:20:24.358
share them with the class as a
whole, I will,

00:20:24.358 --> 00:20:27.953
on a normal day,
meet outside and continue to

00:20:27.953 --> 00:20:32.826
talk with however many of you
want to do that until you're

00:20:32.826 --> 00:20:35.968
done.
I just love talking about this

00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:40.230
stuff and I welcome you to come
to my office hours.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:43.453
I invite you to ask questions
in class or, if you prefer,

00:20:43.453 --> 00:20:47.012
after class as well.
Again, any questions about any

00:20:47.012 --> 00:20:48.630
of that?
Yeah.

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:49.641
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Shelly Kagan:

00:20:49.641 --> 00:20:52.119
When are my office hours?
That's a great question and I

00:20:52.119 --> 00:20:56.240
don't know the answer to it.
I haven't planned them yet.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.901
On Thursday,
start the class by asking me

00:20:58.901 --> 00:21:01.230
that and I'll give you an
answer.

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:04.819
All right.
Other bits of business.

00:21:04.819 --> 00:21:07.140
I should say something about
grades.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.534
Now many of you may have heard,
many of you may know,

00:21:10.534 --> 00:21:12.950
and if you don't already know
this,

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:16.190
I should warn you,
that I have a reputation around

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.499
Yale as being a harsh grader.
I know this is true,

00:21:19.499 --> 00:21:22.775
that is, I know I have the
reputation, both because I

00:21:22.775 --> 00:21:26.366
periodically in my student
evaluations get told I'm one of

00:21:26.366 --> 00:21:29.650
Yale's harsher graders,
and because every now and then

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:32.740
the Yale Daily News will have an
article about grade inflation

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.688
and they'll always ask me,
"Well Professor Kagan is

00:21:35.688 --> 00:21:38.875
somebody..."
Once there was a story on grade

00:21:38.875 --> 00:21:42.723
inflation that the Yale Daily
News began by saying,

00:21:42.723 --> 00:21:47.880
"As Shelly Kagan (known at Yale
as one of the hardest graders)."

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.930
So I know I've got at least the
reputation of being a hard

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:54.586
grader.
I don't actually know whether

00:21:54.586 --> 00:21:58.063
it's deserved or not,
because Yale does not publish

00:21:58.063 --> 00:22:01.609
information about what the
grading averages are.

00:22:01.609 --> 00:22:04.778
At other schools I've taught at
there's been information along

00:22:04.778 --> 00:22:07.894
the lines of well the typical
grade in an introductory course

00:22:07.894 --> 00:22:09.920
in the humanities is such and
such.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.279
Shortly after I came here to
Yale, and I started realizing

00:22:13.279 --> 00:22:16.581
that people thought I was a
harder grader than most other

00:22:16.581 --> 00:22:19.544
Yale professors,
I called the administration and

00:22:19.544 --> 00:22:22.250
asked, "Do you have this sort of
information?"

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.020
The answer is "Yes."
"Will you give it to me?"

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:28.882
The answer was "No."
They don't share this

00:22:28.882 --> 00:22:31.320
information with the Yale
faculty.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.627
Seems odd.
The explanation,

00:22:33.627 --> 00:22:35.869
of course, actually isn't that
hard to come by.

00:22:35.869 --> 00:22:41.015
The worry is that those of us
who are harder graders than

00:22:41.015 --> 00:22:45.150
average, if the information were
published,

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:49.599
would feel guilty and sort of
ease up on our grading.

00:22:49.599 --> 00:22:53.607
But those who are easier
graders than average will never

00:22:53.607 --> 00:22:58.037
feel guilty and toughen up.
So the result would be a

00:22:58.037 --> 00:23:01.319
constant push up with the
grades.

00:23:01.319 --> 00:23:04.489
At any rate,
I don't know for certainty that

00:23:04.489 --> 00:23:07.953
I'm a harder grader,
but I believe that it's the

00:23:07.953 --> 00:23:12.375
case based on reactions I get
when I give the speech that I'm

00:23:12.375 --> 00:23:17.700
about to give.
Okay, so [laughter].

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.346
When I open the blue book,
the Yale guideline,

00:23:21.346 --> 00:23:24.020
the Yale catalog,
it's got a page,

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.343
as you all know,
where it says what letter

00:23:27.343 --> 00:23:30.447
grades mean at Yale.
I didn't actually bring it this

00:23:30.447 --> 00:23:31.842
year.
Sometimes I do,

00:23:31.842 --> 00:23:34.970
but I've got it pretty much
memorized.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.380
It says, for example,
next to each letter grade what

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:41.710
it means.
B, for example, means good.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:44.141
A means excellent,
C means satisfactory,

00:23:44.141 --> 00:23:45.950
D is passing,
F is failing.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.339
B, let's start with B.
B means good.

00:23:49.339 --> 00:23:53.870
Now the crucial question then
is what does good mean?

00:23:53.870 --> 00:24:01.038
I take good to mean good.
Consequently,

00:24:01.038 --> 00:24:05.788
[laughter]
if you were to write a good

00:24:05.788 --> 00:24:10.410
paper for me,
that would get a B.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:14.977
And when you get a B from
me--now, I say me,

00:24:14.977 --> 00:24:19.101
this is the royal me.
Because I won't actually be

00:24:19.101 --> 00:24:23.559
grading your papers.
Your papers will be graded by a

00:24:23.559 --> 00:24:27.560
small army of TAs.
But they will grade under my

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.294
supervision, and in keeping with
the standards that I ask them to

00:24:32.294 --> 00:24:34.889
grade with.
So when you're pissed off about

00:24:34.889 --> 00:24:37.252
your grade, the person to take
it up with--well,

00:24:37.252 --> 00:24:40.549
take it up with them.
But eventually you'll want to

00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:45.186
take it up with me.
So when you get a B from us,

00:24:45.186 --> 00:24:49.410
B doesn't mean what a piece of
crap.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:54.296
B means good job!
And so you should be pleased to

00:24:54.296 --> 00:24:58.143
get a B, because it meant you
were doing good work and it's

00:24:58.143 --> 00:25:00.930
not easy to do good work in
philosophy.

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:08.069
A means excellent.
Now excellent does not mean

00:25:08.069 --> 00:25:12.449
publishable.
Excellent does not mean you are

00:25:12.449 --> 00:25:15.970
God's gift to philosophy
[laughter].

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:19.374
So it's crucial to understand
it doesn't mean that the only

00:25:19.374 --> 00:25:23.190
way you're going to get an A is
to be God's gift to philosophy.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:28.300
A means excellent work for a
first class in philosophy.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.605
This is an introductory class.
It does not presuppose any

00:25:31.605 --> 00:25:33.340
background in philosophy.

00:25:36.539 --> 00:25:40.910
Still, to get an A,
you've got to show some flair

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.960
for the subject.
You've got to show not only

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.990
have you understood the ideas
that have been put forward in

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.549
the readings and in the lectures
and so forth,

00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:52.532
but you see how to sort of put
them together in the paper in a

00:25:52.532 --> 00:25:54.829
way that shows you've got some
aptitude here.

00:25:54.829 --> 00:25:57.190
You did it in a way that made
us take note.

00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:00.700
That's what we try to reserve
As for.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.831
Some of you will end up getting
As, if not at the beginning,

00:26:03.831 --> 00:26:06.757
by the end of the semester.
Many of you will end up getting

00:26:06.757 --> 00:26:09.309
Bs, if not at the beginning,
by the end of the semester.

00:26:09.309 --> 00:26:14.460
Many of you will not start out
doing good work.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:19.267
Many of you will start out
doing satisfactory work or,

00:26:19.267 --> 00:26:23.349
truth be told,
less than satisfactory work.

00:26:23.349 --> 00:26:26.329
Now look, I was an
undergraduate once.

00:26:26.329 --> 00:26:31.329
And I know what it is to write
a typical undergraduate paper.

00:26:31.329 --> 00:26:35.710
You sit down the night before
and you had a couple of ideas.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:37.960
You thought about it maybe for
a half an hour.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.847
And you meant to get to it
sooner, but you had a lot of

00:26:40.847 --> 00:26:43.839
other things to do.
And you throw it off in a

00:26:43.839 --> 00:26:46.829
couple of hours and maybe stay
up late.

00:26:46.829 --> 00:26:50.762
You know it's not the worst
thing you ever wrote,

00:26:50.762 --> 00:26:54.450
and it's not the best thing you
ever wrote,

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.406
and it has a couple of nice
ideas, but maybe it could be

00:26:57.406 --> 00:27:01.640
better.
It's sort of a satisfactory job.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:09.165
Yale says satisfactory means C.
So many of you will start off

00:27:09.165 --> 00:27:12.609
the semester writing that kind
of paper.

00:27:12.609 --> 00:27:16.108
And the fact of the matter is,
some of you will start off

00:27:16.108 --> 00:27:20.159
writing worse papers than that.
Because writing a philosophy

00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:23.500
paper is a difficult thing to
learn how to do.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:28.342
It's exercising a set of
muscles that a lot of you have

00:27:28.342 --> 00:27:31.660
not spent a lot of time
exercising.

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.789
Now it's not as though you
haven't spent any time doing it.

00:27:33.789 --> 00:27:36.898
You've had bull sessions,
right, with your high school

00:27:36.898 --> 00:27:39.890
friends or in your college dorm
or what have you.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:43.283
But you haven't done it with
the kind of discipline and rigor

00:27:43.283 --> 00:27:46.887
that we're looking for here.
So, like anything else,

00:27:46.887 --> 00:27:50.619
it's a skill that gets better
with practice.

00:27:50.619 --> 00:27:53.920
And what that means,
of course, is you won't do as

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.961
well at the beginning as you're
likely to be doing toward the

00:27:57.961 --> 00:27:59.273
end.
Some of you,

00:27:59.273 --> 00:28:02.109
unfortunately,
won't do very good jobs at the

00:28:02.109 --> 00:28:05.138
beginning--and my TAs,
I'll encourage them to be

00:28:05.138 --> 00:28:08.438
prepared to give Ds.
If the vices of the paper

00:28:08.438 --> 00:28:11.680
significantly outweigh the
virtues, that's a D.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:15.327
If the vices very significantly
outweigh whatever virtues there

00:28:15.327 --> 00:28:19.689
are, that's some kind of an F.
So the fact of the matter is

00:28:19.689 --> 00:28:24.560
many of you in your initial
papers will get lower grades

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.520
than you've probably ever gotten
before in your life.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:36.390
I wanted to warn you about that.
Now I say this not so much to

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:41.586
depress the hell out of you,
but (a) partly to warn you,

00:28:41.586 --> 00:28:47.349
and (b) to make it clear that I
believe that it's a skill.

00:28:47.349 --> 00:28:50.556
Writing a good philosophy paper
is a skill and you can get

00:28:50.556 --> 00:28:52.448
better at it.
Consequently,

00:28:52.448 --> 00:28:55.269
most of you will get better at
it.

00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:57.140
So let me make the following
remark.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:02.049
Officially, each paper--you
have three five-page papers.

00:29:02.049 --> 00:29:08.359
Each paper is worth 25% of your
grade, officially.

00:29:08.359 --> 00:29:11.259
But--the remaining 25% is
discussion section;

00:29:11.259 --> 00:29:13.160
I'll get to that in a
minute--officially,

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.630
25% of your grade is for each
of the three papers.

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:19.549
But if, over the course of the
semester, you get better,

00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:22.970
then we will give,
at the end of the semester,

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:25.931
when we're figuring out your
semester grade,

00:29:25.931 --> 00:29:29.512
we'll give the later,
stronger papers more than their

00:29:29.512 --> 00:29:31.950
official weight.
For many of you,

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:35.859
the first paper will be clearly
the worst paper you write.

00:29:35.859 --> 00:29:39.029
And then we'll just throw that
grade away;

00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:41.519
give greater weight to the
second and third papers.

00:29:41.519 --> 00:29:43.849
If the third paper is the
strongest, we will give even

00:29:43.849 --> 00:29:46.733
more weight to the third paper.
There's no formula here,

00:29:46.733 --> 00:29:49.301
a great deal depends on the
overall pattern,

00:29:49.301 --> 00:29:52.944
what your TA tells me about how
you've done over the course of

00:29:52.944 --> 00:29:55.996
the semester.
But this policy of giving

00:29:55.996 --> 00:29:59.078
greater weight,
if you show improvement,

00:29:59.078 --> 00:30:03.109
is something that most of you
will benefit from.

00:30:03.109 --> 00:30:05.932
So if you end up not doing
well, the moral of the story is

00:30:05.932 --> 00:30:08.259
not to go running off and
dropping the class,

00:30:08.259 --> 00:30:11.829
but to figure out what you did
right, what you didn't do right,

00:30:11.829 --> 00:30:14.938
how to make the second paper
better and the third paper

00:30:14.938 --> 00:30:18.069
stronger, again.
And if you do show improvement,

00:30:18.069 --> 00:30:21.900
that will very significantly
influence and emerge in terms of

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:25.220
the impact it has on your
overall semester grade.

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:29.073
Because of this policy,
I don't actually know when all

00:30:29.073 --> 00:30:33.290
is said and done whether at the
end of the semester I'm any

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:35.254
harder,
whether I depart from the

00:30:35.254 --> 00:30:38.152
average or not.
Let me quickly mention there's

00:30:38.152 --> 00:30:41.739
a fairly typical grade
distribution for the overall

00:30:41.739 --> 00:30:45.039
grades of this,
at the end of the semester.

00:30:45.039 --> 00:30:50.184
Roughly 25% of you are likely
to end up with some kind of an A

00:30:50.184 --> 00:30:55.434
at the end of the semester.
Fifty, 55% of you or so are

00:30:55.434 --> 00:30:59.589
likely to end up with some kind
of a B.

00:30:59.589 --> 00:31:03.331
Twenty, 25% percent of you
might end up with some sort of a

00:31:03.331 --> 00:31:04.969
C.
Sometimes there's a couple of

00:31:04.969 --> 00:31:06.730
percent that end up worse than
that.

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:09.937
Unsurprisingly,
you've got the ability to do

00:31:09.937 --> 00:31:14.412
decent work in this class and
most of you have the ability to

00:31:14.412 --> 00:31:16.742
do good work,
and some of you have,

00:31:16.742 --> 00:31:19.375
a fair chunk of you have,
the ability to do excellent

00:31:19.375 --> 00:31:22.127
work,
though it may take some work on

00:31:22.127 --> 00:31:26.327
your part to get to that point.
The last thing I should say

00:31:26.327 --> 00:31:28.829
about the grades is why do I do
this?

00:31:28.829 --> 00:31:34.349
It's really I try to do it as a
sign of respect for you.

00:31:34.349 --> 00:31:36.456
I know that may seem like a
surprising thing to say when

00:31:36.456 --> 00:31:38.715
I've just sort of gone on my
little gleeful amount about how

00:31:38.715 --> 00:31:40.400
I'm going to fail all of you
[laughter],

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:46.310
but it's worth my saying you
guys are so smart.

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:52.725
You're so talented.
You've gotten so far on your

00:31:52.725 --> 00:31:58.529
ability that many of you have
learned to coast.

00:31:58.529 --> 00:32:03.676
It's not doing you any kind of
service to let you continue

00:32:03.676 --> 00:32:06.661
coasting.
My goal here is to be honest

00:32:06.661 --> 00:32:09.065
with you, right?
Look, you're smart enough

00:32:09.065 --> 00:32:12.076
probably most of you to pull off
some sort of B without breaking

00:32:12.076 --> 00:32:14.084
into a sweat,
or at least not a significant

00:32:14.084 --> 00:32:16.269
sweat.
So be it.

00:32:16.269 --> 00:32:20.730
But it's just lying to you to
pretend that that's excellence

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:23.791
in philosophy.
So what I want to do in this

00:32:23.791 --> 00:32:27.759
class is be honest with you and
tell you, "You've really done

00:32:27.759 --> 00:32:32.190
work here to be extraordinarily
proud of yourself" versus "Yeah,

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.809
you've done something okay" or
"You've done good work.

00:32:34.809 --> 00:32:38.460
Admittedly, it's not great,
but you've done good work."

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.309
All right, that's 75% of your
grade is the papers.

00:32:41.309 --> 00:32:45.230
The remaining 25% of your grade
is based on discussion section.

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:48.970
Now that's a lot of your grade
to turn on discussion section.

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:52.859
So the first thing I need to
tell you is I really mean it.

00:32:52.859 --> 00:32:57.113
If you blow off discussion
section, you're grade will

00:32:57.113 --> 00:32:59.168
suffer.
So it's worth knowing in a

00:32:59.168 --> 00:33:01.907
general way what you need to do
to earn a good grade in

00:33:01.907 --> 00:33:04.190
discussion section and here the
answer is,

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:08.660
perhaps the obvious one,
you need to participate.

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:12.742
You need to come to discussion
sections having thought about

00:33:12.742 --> 00:33:15.579
the lectures,
having done the readings,

00:33:15.579 --> 00:33:19.473
having thought about the
questions that they raise,

00:33:19.473 --> 00:33:23.757
and you need to come to
discussion section then prepared

00:33:23.757 --> 00:33:26.950
to discuss this week's set of
issues.

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:32.194
You need to listen to what your
classmates are saying and say

00:33:32.194 --> 00:33:36.260
why you disagree with them.
And not just that you disagree

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.200
with them, but to raise an
objection.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:42.187
Or why you agree with them.
And when somebody else then

00:33:42.187 --> 00:33:43.816
attacks them,
say, "Look, I think that what

00:33:43.816 --> 00:33:46.299
John was saying was a good point
and here's how I think he should

00:33:46.299 --> 00:33:48.619
have defended his position,"
or what have you.

00:33:48.619 --> 00:33:53.309
You need to engage in
philosophical discussion.

00:33:53.309 --> 00:33:58.130
If you're not participating in
discussion section,

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:02.950
you're not doing what the
section is there for.

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:06.059
Philosophers love to talk and
we love to argue.

00:34:06.059 --> 00:34:11.466
The way to get better at
thinking about philosophy is by

00:34:11.466 --> 00:34:15.673
talking about philosophy.
So I'm putting my money where

00:34:15.673 --> 00:34:17.187
my mouth is.
I'm saying, "Look,

00:34:17.187 --> 00:34:19.230
yeah, that's an important part
of the class.

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:23.320
So important that it's going to
be worth 25% of your grade."

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.795
Again, it doesn't mean--this is
slightly different from the

00:34:26.795 --> 00:34:30.450
papers--that you've got to be
brilliant philosophically to get

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:32.976
an A.
Rather, you've got to be a

00:34:32.976 --> 00:34:37.559
wonderful class citizen to get
an A for discussion section.

00:34:37.559 --> 00:34:40.376
So, as I put it,
in fact I think I put it this

00:34:40.376 --> 00:34:43.505
way on the syllabus,
participation--and here I mean

00:34:43.505 --> 00:34:46.548
respectful participation,
not hogging the

00:34:46.548 --> 00:34:50.397
limelight--participation can
improve your grade,

00:34:50.397 --> 00:34:54.191
but it won't lower your grade.
Nonparticipation,

00:34:54.191 --> 00:34:56.693
or not being there,
that will lower your

00:34:56.693 --> 00:35:00.390
participation grade.
Any question about any of that?

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:03.003
All right.
So I'm sorry to have sort of

00:35:03.003 --> 00:35:06.015
the long gloom and doom,
but it seems that it's only

00:35:06.015 --> 00:35:08.909
fair to let you know what you're
getting into.

00:35:08.909 --> 00:35:10.840
One other remark about the
discussion sections.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:16.086
The way I think of it is like
the conversation hour for your

00:35:16.086 --> 00:35:20.456
foreign language class.
How many of you have had a

00:35:20.456 --> 00:35:24.610
philosophy class before?
Thanks.

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:27.010
Maybe 15% of you.
Maybe 20% of you.

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:30.800
Most of you have not.
That's pretty normal.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.246
Don't go into discussion
section thinking,

00:35:33.246 --> 00:35:35.618
"Oh, I can't talk.
I don't have any background in

00:35:35.618 --> 00:35:37.053
philosophy.
I've never done this sort of

00:35:37.053 --> 00:35:40.179
thing before."
That's true for most of you.

00:35:40.179 --> 00:35:47.400
The way you get better is by
talking philosophy.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.469
All right.
Next remark.

00:35:50.469 --> 00:35:52.788
I guess this is sort of just
one last connection with regard

00:35:52.788 --> 00:35:54.594
to grades.
This is an intro philosophy

00:35:54.594 --> 00:35:56.573
class.
The crucial point about intro

00:35:56.573 --> 00:35:58.769
is it means first class in
philosophy.

00:35:58.769 --> 00:36:02.099
It doesn't presuppose any
background in philosophy.

00:36:02.099 --> 00:36:04.860
It doesn't necessarily mean
easy.

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.933
Some of this material for some
of you is going to be very,

00:36:07.933 --> 00:36:10.691
very difficult.
And although the number of

00:36:10.691 --> 00:36:14.869
pages that you'll have to read
are not--there's not a lot.

00:36:14.869 --> 00:36:18.610
Probably in a typical week,
50 pages, maybe less.

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:20.771
For many of you,
you're going to find it dense

00:36:20.771 --> 00:36:22.798
material.
And although I don't really

00:36:22.798 --> 00:36:26.239
have the fantasy that many of
you will read this stuff twice,

00:36:26.239 --> 00:36:30.404
if you had the time to do it,
that would be a wonderful thing

00:36:30.404 --> 00:36:35.550
to do.
Philosophy is hard stuff to

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:38.590
read.
Other remark about this being

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:42.630
an intro class is that it's
introductory in that the issues

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:46.670
that we're talking about are
kind of first run through.

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:51.498
Every single thing that we
discuss here could be pursued at

00:36:51.498 --> 00:36:53.769
greater depth.
So, for example,

00:36:53.769 --> 00:36:57.176
we'll spend whatever it is,
maybe a week and a half talking

00:36:57.176 --> 00:37:00.230
about the nature of personal
identity, two weeks.

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:04.833
But one could easily spend an
entire semester thinking about

00:37:04.833 --> 00:37:08.055
that question alone.
So don't come away thinking

00:37:08.055 --> 00:37:11.456
that whatever it is that we've
talked about here in lecture is

00:37:11.456 --> 00:37:15.693
the last word on the subject.
Rather, it's something more

00:37:15.693 --> 00:37:19.852
like first words.
Actually, one other word about

00:37:19.852 --> 00:37:24.207
the readings and the lectures.
With one exception,

00:37:24.207 --> 00:37:30.000
I won't be spending very much
time talking about the readings.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.281
The exception is Plato,
where I'll lecture,

00:37:33.281 --> 00:37:37.031
maybe two lectures,
trying to reconstruct Plato's

00:37:37.031 --> 00:37:40.423
central arguments,
at least the arguments relevant

00:37:40.423 --> 00:37:42.545
to our class.
We'll be reading one of Plato's

00:37:42.545 --> 00:37:44.920
dialogues.
But for the most part,

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:49.388
although I'll occasionally,
periodically refer to the

00:37:49.388 --> 00:37:53.048
readings,
I won't spend a lot of time

00:37:53.048 --> 00:37:57.039
talking about the views in the
readings.

00:37:57.039 --> 00:38:01.642
The readings you should think
of as complementary to my

00:38:01.642 --> 00:38:04.752
lectures.
The idea is that there's more

00:38:04.752 --> 00:38:08.610
to say than what I've said.
And you'll find some more of

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:11.000
what there is to say in the
readings.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.878
Or there may be positions that
I mention, but I don't develop,

00:38:13.878 --> 00:38:16.050
because I'm not perhaps
sympathetic to them,

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:19.382
and you might find somebody who
is sympathetic to them,

00:38:19.382 --> 00:38:21.480
developing them in the
readings.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:25.409
The readings are a crucial
component of the class.

00:38:25.409 --> 00:38:31.060
You won't get everything you
need simply by coming to the

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.510
lectures.
But equally the case,

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:37.340
that the views that I'll be
developing in the lectures are,

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:40.628
although not necessarily unique
to me, aren't all laid out in

00:38:40.628 --> 00:38:43.198
the readings.
You won't get everything I'm

00:38:43.198 --> 00:38:47.070
talking about in the lectures,
if all you do is the readings.

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:51.949
They're both parts of the class.
All right.

00:38:51.949 --> 00:38:57.452
I want to end by--I'm not close
to ending, but the last thing

00:38:57.452 --> 00:39:02.679
I'm going to do is read aloud
some student evaluations.

00:39:02.679 --> 00:39:06.660
I have found over the years
that some students like me;

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:10.940
some students don't like me.
I don't know how to make this

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:15.421
point any clearer than to share
with you a sampling of the

00:39:15.421 --> 00:39:18.522
student evaluations.
These are not actually from

00:39:18.522 --> 00:39:21.441
last spring, but they're typical
enough that I was too lazy to

00:39:21.441 --> 00:39:22.590
make some new quotes.

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:29.017
Quote one.
These are actual quotes from

00:39:29.017 --> 00:39:33.131
former actual students.
(1) "The lectures were clear

00:39:33.131 --> 00:39:36.219
and followed a very logical
order."

00:39:36.219 --> 00:39:40.989
(2) "I thought the class was
not always organized."

00:39:40.989 --> 00:39:45.690
(3) "I thought it was a very
well organized class."

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:49.363
(4) "Overall,
I was unsatisfied with this

00:39:49.363 --> 00:39:52.729
course.
Few substantive conclusions

00:39:52.729 --> 00:39:55.332
were reached."
(5) Along the same vein,

00:39:55.332 --> 00:39:58.314
"I think he should avoid saying
at the end of each segment of

00:39:58.314 --> 00:40:00.113
the class,
âUltimately,

00:40:00.113 --> 00:40:04.400
you'll have to decide what to
think for yourself.'"

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.144
[laughter]
I should end the class by

00:40:06.144 --> 00:40:08.853
saying, "You will believe."
Actually, I started the class

00:40:08.853 --> 00:40:12.530
by saying that.
You will believe what I believe.

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:15.786
(6) "It might be improved by
presenting other views better

00:40:15.786 --> 00:40:18.352
and more objectively,
since Kagan always ended a

00:40:18.352 --> 00:40:21.194
particular line of reasoning by
defeating the argument if he

00:40:21.194 --> 00:40:24.702
didn't agree with it.
He could be a bit more unbiased

00:40:24.702 --> 00:40:27.510
and tolerant of other
perspectives."

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:31.117
(7) "Lectures were sometimes
repetitive or obvious,

00:40:31.117 --> 00:40:34.579
but occasionally,
they provided new insights."

00:40:34.579 --> 00:40:37.956
(8) "I know that some felt the
pace of the arguments was a

00:40:37.956 --> 00:40:41.510
little slow, but I felt that
this was generally necessary,

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:45.237
not only for the
unphilosophy-savvy population,

00:40:45.237 --> 00:40:49.893
but also to cover all points."
(9) "Extremely thorough and

00:40:49.893 --> 00:40:52.080
thoughtful.
Receptive to questions.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.320
Brilliant."
I like that one [laughter].

00:40:55.320 --> 00:41:00.065
"Often long-winded." Hmmm.
(10) "He does go around and

00:41:00.065 --> 00:41:04.211
around the same idea a number of
times, which does cut down on

00:41:04.211 --> 00:41:07.406
the notes for the class,
but it can get a little

00:41:07.406 --> 00:41:09.711
boring."
(11) "Though I've heard

00:41:09.711 --> 00:41:13.481
students say he often repeats
himself, I think this is a merit

00:41:13.481 --> 00:41:17.004
in a philosophy course in which
arguments and thoughts can

00:41:17.004 --> 00:41:21.561
quickly become confusing."
(12) "Shelly Kagan is a

00:41:21.561 --> 00:41:27.650
fabulous, resourceful,
utterly convincing lecturer."

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:30.790
(13) "He would work through
arguments right in front of--" I

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:33.186
like this one,
because this is what I at least

00:41:33.186 --> 00:41:35.980
aim to be inside my head.
Here's what I'm doing.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:39.836
Thirteen: "He would work
through arguments right in front

00:41:39.836 --> 00:41:43.900
of us, which then helped me work
through them on my own."

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:48.929
(14) "Shelly is an incredibly
dynamic lecturer."

00:41:48.929 --> 00:41:53.977
(15) "He's just in his own
world babbling on and on

00:41:53.977 --> 00:41:58.219
[laughter].
I'd zone out with regularity."

00:41:58.219 --> 00:42:03.714
(16) "I have to say that Shelly
Kagan is probably the best

00:42:03.714 --> 00:42:07.860
lecturer I had in my four years
at Yale."

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:13.640
(17) "He's the type of teacher
you either love or hate."

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.718
Now that's pretty clearly true.
I wish there were some easy

00:42:16.718 --> 00:42:20.513
litmus test that I could just
give you so you'd know which of

00:42:20.513 --> 00:42:23.739
you would be making a mistake
taking this class.

00:42:23.739 --> 00:42:25.240
I don't know how to give it to
you.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:30.629
Next topic, grades.
(1) "He tried to intimidate us

00:42:30.629 --> 00:42:34.966
too much with his promise of
impossible grading so that

00:42:34.966 --> 00:42:38.260
everyone took the class
credit/D/fail,

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:41.000
when we all probably ended up
with As or Bs.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.428
His grading was not hard."
(2) "I recommend it,

00:42:46.428 --> 00:42:52.928
but only credit/D/fail.
Professor Kagan is harsh with

00:42:52.928 --> 00:42:55.835
grading."
(3) "When Shelly says he's the

00:42:55.835 --> 00:42:58.610
harshest grader on campus,
he isn't lying.

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:03.756
I was consistently surprised by
how poorly I did on papers

00:43:03.756 --> 00:43:07.191
[laughter].
The standards in this class are

00:43:07.191 --> 00:43:10.110
just different from all other
classes."

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:15.869
(4) "Kagan's reputation as a
harsh grader is unfounded.

00:43:15.869 --> 00:43:19.869
If you put in the effort,
the grade will reflect that."

00:43:19.869 --> 00:43:22.909
So that settles the question am
I a harsh grader or not.

00:43:22.909 --> 00:43:25.188
The last question for the
evaluation is should you take

00:43:25.188 --> 00:43:27.190
the class or not?
Would you recommend it to

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:30.535
somebody else?
(1) "I believe this class is

00:43:30.535 --> 00:43:35.600
one of the most mind-opening
experiences of my life."

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.539
(2) "No.
It's a waste of a course."

00:43:40.539 --> 00:43:43.847
[laughter]
(3) "It gets kind of depressing

00:43:43.847 --> 00:43:48.849
at times, but I suppose that's
due to the nature of the subject

00:43:48.849 --> 00:43:52.445
[laughter]."
(4) "This course stands out as

00:43:52.445 --> 00:43:56.747
one of the more unique and
stimulating courses I've taken

00:43:56.747 --> 00:44:00.070
at Yale."
(5) "Excellent class.

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:03.000
It made me think about life and
death in a new way.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.900
What more can you ask for from
a class?"

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:10.916
(6) "I would not recommend it.
The class just seemed to be a

00:44:10.916 --> 00:44:15.046
platform for Kagan to throw out
random ideas and the students

00:44:15.046 --> 00:44:18.420
were never required to engage in
any thought."

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:21.948
Well, that clears that up.
Let me end with a couple of

00:44:21.948 --> 00:44:25.023
other quick remarks.
One--these are some of my

00:44:25.023 --> 00:44:27.670
all-time favorites from previous
years.

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:32.579
(1) "Not doing the reading
didn't hurt me at all."

00:44:32.579 --> 00:44:35.420
Now, these are anonymous
comments.

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:36.890
I don't know who wrote this
comment.

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:40.679
But I do know this.
Whoever wrote this remark is an

00:44:40.679 --> 00:44:44.937
idiot [laughter].
Whoever wrote this remark seems

00:44:44.937 --> 00:44:50.501
to be under the impression that
the point of being at Yale is to

00:44:50.501 --> 00:44:55.800
spend $40,000 a year of your
parents' money and get away with

00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:00.891
learning as little as possible.
Well, for those of you who want

00:45:00.891 --> 00:45:04.530
to try it, you probably could
pass this class and maybe even

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:07.490
get an okay grade without doing
the readings.

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:11.393
There's no final exam.
But still, it's crucial to

00:45:11.393 --> 00:45:16.266
understand, doing the readings
is an important part of learning

00:45:16.266 --> 00:45:20.079
what this course has to offer.
Different quote.

00:45:20.079 --> 00:45:26.343
"Kagan is a self-righteous
little man" [laughter]" Now I've

00:45:26.343 --> 00:45:31.094
got to tell you,
that bit about being little,

00:45:31.094 --> 00:45:34.220
that really hurts.
Another one.

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.600
"Great course.
Wonderful professor.

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:40.777
Fascinating subjects.
The deepest thinking I've done

00:45:40.777 --> 00:45:43.119
in my life."
Final quote.

00:45:43.119 --> 00:45:47.626
"This class taught me how to
think more than any other at

00:45:47.626 --> 00:45:49.829
Yale."
I don't know whether I pull it

00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:51.116
off.
Pretty obviously,

00:45:51.116 --> 00:45:54.436
for a number of students,
I don't manage to pull it off,

00:45:54.436 --> 00:45:56.730
but that's at least what my aim
is.

00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:01.562
I'm trying to help you think.
I welcome you and I hope you'll

00:46:01.562 --> 00:46:02.962
be back on Thursday.

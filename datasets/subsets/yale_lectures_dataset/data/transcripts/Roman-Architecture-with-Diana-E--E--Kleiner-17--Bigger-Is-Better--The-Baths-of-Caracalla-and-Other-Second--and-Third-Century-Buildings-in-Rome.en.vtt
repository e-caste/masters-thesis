00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.020
Prof: Good morning.
 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.484
From the time of Julius Caesar,
we have seen the rulers of Rome

00:00:08.484 --> 00:00:13.861
brag about building buildings
that were bigger than any others

00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:15.360
in the world.
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.958
You'll remember Caesar referred
to his Temple of Mars in that

00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:24.403
way, that he was building the
largest Temple of Mars in the

00:00:24.403 --> 00:00:25.170
world.
 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.959
And we also saw the same for
Domitian, with his palace on the

00:00:28.959 --> 00:00:31.874
Palatine Hill;
for Trajan with his enormous

00:00:31.874 --> 00:00:33.486
forum;
for Hadrian,

00:00:33.486 --> 00:00:37.415
building the greatest--
largest dome that had been

00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:40.373
built up until that time and,
as we discussed,

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:44.000
still the largest diameter dome
in the city of Rome today;

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.805
and Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli,
just as a selection of

00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:48.610
examples.
 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.080
We are going to see today that
if bigger was better,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.385
biggest is best,
and in the case of the emperor

00:00:56.385 --> 00:00:59.868
Caracalla,
an emperor who was a

00:00:59.868 --> 00:01:05.093
megalomaniac,
in the tradition of Nero and

00:01:05.093 --> 00:01:08.507
Domitian,
that he built the largest

00:01:08.507 --> 00:01:10.828
imperial bath structure to date.
 

00:01:10.828 --> 00:01:14.578
And we're going to be looking
at that bath structure today,

00:01:14.578 --> 00:01:17.412
and we're going to see it as
really a colossal and

00:01:17.412 --> 00:01:20.420
fascinating building,
in all kinds of ways.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.260
But before I get to that--in
fact,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.250
we'll end with that bath
structure today--

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.912
before I get to that,
I would like to look with you

00:01:28.912 --> 00:01:32.879
at architecture in Rome,
in the second and third

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:36.327
centuries A.D.,
and we'll see that architecture

00:01:36.327 --> 00:01:39.580
is quite varied in terms of
whether it's private,

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.440
it's civic, it's also funerary.
 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.509
I want to begin though by just
reminding you of what we talked

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.709
about last time.
 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.186
We looked at the city of Ostia,
and we looked at the city of

00:01:53.186 --> 00:01:55.720
Ostia, the port of Rome,
in its entirety;

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.462
once again, its public
buildings, its civic structures,

00:02:00.462 --> 00:02:03.010
its commercial enterprises.
 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.054
And we also went,
at the very end of the lecture,

00:02:07.054 --> 00:02:11.013
out to Isola Sacra,
where the tombs of those who

00:02:11.013 --> 00:02:13.710
lived in Ostia were located.
 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.188
And I show you a couple of
those again now on the screen;

00:02:17.188 --> 00:02:19.992
these brick-faced tombs,
these tombs that are made of

00:02:19.992 --> 00:02:21.810
concrete,
at Isola Sacra,

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.008
that were put up for the
professionals,

00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:27.331
for the traders,
the commercial merchants and so

00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:29.158
on that lived in the city of
Ostia.

00:02:29.158 --> 00:02:32.318
They were made of brick-faced
concrete construction.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:35.120
They had barrel vaults or groin
vaults inside.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.014
And you can see also that they
were faced with brick,

00:02:38.014 --> 00:02:40.631
and they were faced with brick,
as we discussed,

00:02:40.631 --> 00:02:43.097
that was exposed;
the idea of brick being

00:02:43.097 --> 00:02:47.279
attractive in its own right,
a fabulously beautiful facing,

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:52.008
that they take advantage of in
the second century A.D.,

00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:57.384
and decide not to stucco it
over, as you can see so well

00:02:57.384 --> 00:02:58.068
here.
 

00:02:58.068 --> 00:03:01.454
The doorways into those tombs,
surrounded by travertine jambs

00:03:01.454 --> 00:03:04.088
and lintels,
the inscription in the center,

00:03:04.088 --> 00:03:08.180
the small slit windows,
and then a pediment at the top.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.579
We saw, when we looked at
funerary architecture in the age

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.680
of Augustus, for example,
that is was very varied;

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.038
very varied.
 

00:03:16.038 --> 00:03:22.008
Tombs in the shape of pyramids,
in the shape of circular tombs.

00:03:22.008 --> 00:03:24.657
Tombs that made reference to
bakeries, like the Tomb of the

00:03:24.657 --> 00:03:25.479
Baker Eurysaces.
 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:29.240
There is still a certain amount
of variety in tomb architecture

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.032
in the second century A.D.,
but they tend to hone in on one

00:03:33.032 --> 00:03:37.330
type in particular,
and that type is the so-called

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.639
house tomb type;
which is exactly what we see

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.133
here, a tomb that is rectangular
in shape, for the most part,

00:03:44.133 --> 00:03:46.462
boxlike, and does resemble,
very closely,

00:03:46.462 --> 00:03:48.770
a house;
this close relationship that

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.259
we've talked about so many times
this semester between houses of

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:54.310
the living and houses of the
dead.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.729
So we looked at those last time.
 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:04:00.231
And where I want to begin today
is just to demonstrate to you

00:04:00.231 --> 00:04:04.734
that these same kinds of house
tombs that we see in Ostia and

00:04:04.734 --> 00:04:07.669
Isola Sacra,
in the second century A.D.,

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:08.960
we also see in Rome.
 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.340
And in some cases they are
commissioned by individuals of

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.771
comparable social status,
to those in Ostia,

00:04:16.771 --> 00:04:20.569
but sometimes they are
commissioned by the most elite.

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:23.785
And I'd like to begin with an
example of a similar tomb

00:04:23.785 --> 00:04:25.750
commissioned by the most elite.
 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.115
This is the so-called Tomb of
Annia Regilla,

00:04:29.115 --> 00:04:29.899
in Rome.
 

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:33.509
It was put up on the famous via
Appia, or the Appian Way.

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:37.319
It dates to around A.D. 161.
 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.880
In this case we know who the
commissioner was,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.670
and I can show you what he
looked like as well.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.154
You see him here,
on the right-hand side of the

00:04:45.154 --> 00:04:45.639
screen.
 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:51.009
He was a man by the name of
Herodes Atticus;

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.317
I've put his name on the
Monument List for you,

00:04:52.317 --> 00:04:52.829
Herodes Atticus.
 

00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:55.740
Herodes Atticus was actually a
Greek.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.281
He was Athenian,
from the Greek part of the

00:04:59.281 --> 00:05:00.040
Empire.
 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.850
He lived in Athens,
for the most part,

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.005
and he commissioned a very
famous music hall,

00:05:04.005 --> 00:05:05.720
an odeon, which still survives.
 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.750
You can see it over here.
 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.043
It's without its roof today,
but it was originally one of

00:05:11.043 --> 00:05:13.220
these roofed music halls,
an odeon.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.009
It is located on the slope of
the Acropolis in Athens;

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:22.262
the Acropolis that of course we
know primarily for its great

00:05:22.262 --> 00:05:24.687
architectural feats of the fifth
century B.C.

00:05:24.687 --> 00:05:25.459
in Greece.
 

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:28.670
This is the Roman building,
put up by Herodes in the second

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.550
century, and we see it on the
slope of the Acropolis,

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.879
very well preserved.
 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:37.730
In modern times its greatest
fame is the fact that Yanni

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.788
performed his "Live at the
Acropolis"

00:05:41.788 --> 00:05:45.670
concert at the Odeon of Herodes
Atticus.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.547
And even if you don't like
Yanni, it's actually quite an

00:05:48.547 --> 00:05:52.437
interesting concert to view--
and one can view it in video

00:05:52.437 --> 00:05:55.375
and so on--
because it does take such

00:05:55.375 --> 00:06:00.250
wonderful advantage of this
extraordinary ancient structure,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.459
as Yanni presents his music.
 

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:06.170
At any rate,
at one point Herodes Atticus,

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.754
who had a lot of connections,
not only in Athens but around

00:06:09.754 --> 00:06:11.389
the Empire,
at one point,

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:15.257
through those connections,
he gets himself appointed a

00:06:15.257 --> 00:06:18.560
senator in Rome,
and in order to take up that

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.288
position he needs to leave
Athens behind and go spend some

00:06:22.288 --> 00:06:24.577
time in Rome,
and he and his wife,

00:06:24.577 --> 00:06:27.949
Annia Regilla,
set up house in Rome.

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:30.050
Annia Regilla,
unfortunately,

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.572
dies in Rome,
and he needs to bury her,

00:06:33.572 --> 00:06:37.009
and he decides to bury her in
Rome,

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:39.675
instead of in Athens,
and he builds for her a tomb on

00:06:39.675 --> 00:06:42.309
the Appian Way,
on the Via Appia,

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:46.656
in around 161 A.D.;
that's the date that we believe

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:47.410
she died.
 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:54.089
And we see a view of that tomb
here.

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:57.023
What we're looking at--and you
probably recognize this already

00:06:57.023 --> 00:06:59.956
because we've looked at a number
of models from this museum of

00:06:59.956 --> 00:07:02.769
casts in Rome,
the Museo della Civiltà

00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:05.310
Romana,
in EUR in Rome.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.439
And I show you two views of
this model of the Tomb of Annia

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:10.882
Regilla;
one that we see from the front

00:07:10.882 --> 00:07:14.560
and another that we see from,
if we're facing the monument,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.399
the left side of the tomb.
 

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:19.172
And these are extremely
helpful, because they give us a

00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:21.790
very good sense of what we are
dealing with here.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:26.543
It is clear that we are dealing
with a tomb type that is not

00:07:26.543 --> 00:07:30.009
that different from what we saw
in Ostia;

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:31.908
although this looks more like a
temple than it looks like a

00:07:31.908 --> 00:07:32.170
house.
 

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.350
And you can see that right off.
 

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.000
It looks exactly like a typical
Roman temple.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.990
We see that it is on a high
podium;

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.074
it has a deep porch;
it has freestanding columns in

00:07:42.074 --> 00:07:44.769
that porch;
it has a single staircase on

00:07:44.769 --> 00:07:48.529
the front of the structure;
has a façade orientation;

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:51.230
then an entranceway into the
structure.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.810
It also has freestanding
columns that support a pediment.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.766
So if I were to show you this,
and not identify it and say to

00:07:57.766 --> 00:08:00.278
you: "What kind of a
building is this?"

00:08:00.278 --> 00:08:01.899
I'm sure you would have said it
was a temple;

00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:05.050
and you would've been right in
the sense that it looks most

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:05.920
like a temple.
 

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:11.230
But it is a tomb in the form of
a temple, as you can well see

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.850
here.
 

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.305
Looking on the side of the
monument, you can also see those

00:08:15.305 --> 00:08:17.750
same features that I've just
described.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.639
And while we are looking at
this view--

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:22.120
because I'm not going to bring
it back--

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.732
I want to point out one detail
that will loom large as we look

00:08:25.732 --> 00:08:27.389
further at this structure.
 

00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:34.517
You will see on the left side
of the tomb that the architect

00:08:34.517 --> 00:08:38.910
has created,
has kind of scalloped out the

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.573
side on either side,
creating niches,

00:08:41.573 --> 00:08:45.720
tall niches on the side,
and placed columns into that

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.313
space;
which is a very unusual thing

00:08:48.313 --> 00:08:48.759
to do.
 

00:08:48.759 --> 00:08:51.304
It's not true on the other side
of the monument,

00:08:51.304 --> 00:08:53.309
only on this side of the
structure.

00:08:53.309 --> 00:08:55.639
Why has the architect done that?
 

00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:58.043
I think it might have something
to do with the siting,

00:08:58.043 --> 00:09:00.038
perhaps how you viewed it from
the street.

00:09:00.038 --> 00:09:03.240
Maybe it was skewed in such a
way that you would see not only

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.320
the façade but also the
side,

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:11.267
and he wanted to emphasize the
columns on that particular side

00:09:11.267 --> 00:09:13.120
of the structure.
 

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.058
But it may also have just had
to do with a quirk,

00:09:16.058 --> 00:09:20.687
with a particular interest that
the architect or the patron had

00:09:20.687 --> 00:09:24.570
in doing something different
than any other tomb,

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.090
and I want to return to that
point in a moment.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:31.113
But most significant of all is
that in terms of the building

00:09:31.113 --> 00:09:33.727
technique,
the use of concrete faced with

00:09:33.727 --> 00:09:37.066
exposed brick,
this is exactly what we saw in

00:09:37.066 --> 00:09:37.629
Ostia.
 

00:09:37.629 --> 00:09:40.190
And you can see that just as in
Ostia,

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.210
they have taken that brick as
far as it can go,

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:47.090
in terms of its aesthetic
value, by respecting the texture

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:51.160
of the brick,
playing that texture off,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.831
playing color,
different colored bricks,

00:09:53.831 --> 00:09:55.570
a reddish brick against a more
yellowish colored brick,

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.009
playing those off against one
another,

00:09:59.009 --> 00:10:02.716
and then adding certain very
highly decorative details like a

00:10:02.716 --> 00:10:05.160
meander pattern,
that we're going to see in a

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.692
moment,
and decoration around the

00:10:07.692 --> 00:10:11.658
windows of the tomb,
done in stucco.

00:10:11.658 --> 00:10:13.798
The columns,
however, are marble;

00:10:13.798 --> 00:10:16.394
the columns are marble,
and in that sense again

00:10:16.394 --> 00:10:19.610
something somewhat different
than what we saw at Ostia.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:23.090
This is a view of the tomb as
it looks today.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.942
The porch is not well
preserved, and I can't show you

00:10:25.942 --> 00:10:26.710
any of that.
 

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.927
But I can show you the rest of
the structure,

00:10:28.927 --> 00:10:31.750
and you can see it quite well
in this particular view.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.548
And again, you see that it is
indeed well preserved.

00:10:34.548 --> 00:10:37.163
Concrete construction,
faced with brick,

00:10:37.163 --> 00:10:40.182
the brick left exposed,
respected and enjoyed,

00:10:40.182 --> 00:10:41.590
in its own right.
 

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.730
What I've already described:
the playing off of one color of

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.813
brick against another;
this meander pattern done in

00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:49.837
stucco;
the stucco decoration,

00:10:49.837 --> 00:10:53.130
very elaborate decoration,
as we're going to see,

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.432
around the windows;
tall podium,

00:10:55.432 --> 00:10:57.149
we see that here as well.
 

00:10:57.149 --> 00:11:00.470
An extraordinary structure.
 

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.620
And what's interesting I think
to note,

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:06.460
at least culturally and in
terms of social status,

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.957
is the fact that although this
structure was put up for one of

00:11:10.957 --> 00:11:14.587
the most wealthy men in--
or the wife of one of the most

00:11:14.587 --> 00:11:17.100
wealthy men in Rome at this
particular time,

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.354
the general aesthetic is very
similar to what we saw for

00:11:20.354 --> 00:11:23.490
professional people in the city
of Ostia: that is,

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:26.110
a concrete tomb,
in the form of a house,

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:31.048
or a temple in this case,
that has as its facing brick,

00:11:31.048 --> 00:11:34.919
and a respect for that brick in
its own right.

00:11:34.919 --> 00:11:36.379
Here are a couple of details.
 

00:11:36.379 --> 00:11:40.691
I show you once again a detail
of the warehouse or the Horrea

00:11:40.691 --> 00:11:43.710
Epagathiana at Ostia that we
looked at,

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:49.558
and also a detail of the Tomb
of Annia Regilla in Rome.

00:11:49.558 --> 00:11:51.360
And I think you can see here
what I mean.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.330
Again, the different coloration
of brick, the yellowish brick,

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.472
the reddish brick,
played off one against the

00:11:56.472 --> 00:11:59.484
other;
the use of stucco decoration,

00:11:59.484 --> 00:12:04.360
in this case for the volutes of
the composite capitals.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.802
In this case--and in fact
you'll remember I pointed out

00:12:07.802 --> 00:12:11.693
what was interesting about these
capitals at the warehouse was

00:12:11.693 --> 00:12:15.566
that they were--
that the brick was used to make

00:12:15.566 --> 00:12:18.330
up the main body of the capital.
 

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.947
And this is not one of them,
but I also showed you one where

00:12:21.947 --> 00:12:25.501
you could see the way in which
that brick formed the actual

00:12:25.501 --> 00:12:29.331
acanthus leaves of the capital,
and then the volutes added in

00:12:29.331 --> 00:12:29.778
stucco.
 

00:12:29.778 --> 00:12:32.870
We see the same thing at the
Tomb of Annia Regilla.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.240
We see those--and here I think
you can see it well --

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.192
the brick used to create the
lower part of the acanthus

00:12:38.192 --> 00:12:40.249
leaves,
and then stucco added for the

00:12:40.249 --> 00:12:42.905
curving part,
and for some of the additional

00:12:42.905 --> 00:12:45.769
decoration,
the flower and so on up above.

00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:50.985
And so we see--and here again
very elaborate decoration around

00:12:50.985 --> 00:12:56.029
the windows, which we also saw
at the warehouse in Ostia.

00:12:56.029 --> 00:12:58.320
Two more details of the Tomb of
Annia Regilla.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.918
Here you see what I was talking
about before,

00:12:59.918 --> 00:13:04.750
the way the architect has
scooped out two areas on the

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:09.089
left side of the tomb,
and placed the columns inside

00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:11.416
of those,
which is a unique--I don't know

00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:14.058
of any other example of this in
Roman architecture,

00:13:14.058 --> 00:13:16.552
and it underscores,
once again, that when it came

00:13:16.552 --> 00:13:20.068
to tomb architecture,
that the patron could pretty

00:13:20.068 --> 00:13:23.783
much do whatever he wanted,
as long as the architect could

00:13:23.783 --> 00:13:24.240
build it.
 

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.480
It could be quite idiosyncratic
as a form of architecture.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.722
And we see not only has he
scooped out these niches in

00:13:31.722 --> 00:13:34.783
which to place the columns,
but if you look at those

00:13:34.783 --> 00:13:37.409
columns very carefully,
and at the bases of those

00:13:37.409 --> 00:13:39.950
columns, you will see that they
are not round.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:44.520
They are multi-sided,
and the bases are also

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.009
multi-sided.
 

00:13:46.009 --> 00:13:49.076
So doing something very unique
in the context of this

00:13:49.076 --> 00:13:51.139
particular tomb of Annia
Regilla.

00:13:51.139 --> 00:13:52.288
So two main points.
 

00:13:52.288 --> 00:13:56.182
One, that there is clearly an
aesthetic that is used for tomb

00:13:56.182 --> 00:13:59.067
architecture,
concrete faced with brick that

00:13:59.067 --> 00:14:02.210
is used in the uppermost levels
of Roman society,

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.528
and then further down in Roman
society,

00:14:04.528 --> 00:14:07.070
not only in Rome but also in
Ostia.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:10.149
But at the same time
individuality,

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:13.450
eccentricity is valued in tomb
architecture,

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:17.340
allowed in tomb architecture in
a way that perhaps it isn't in

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.700
other forms of Roman
architecture,

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.789
and we see it taken to its
limit in this particular

00:14:22.789 --> 00:14:23.470
building.
 

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.019
Just a few more details.
 

00:14:25.019 --> 00:14:28.678
We see a niche from the Tomb of
Annia Regilla.

00:14:28.678 --> 00:14:32.110
We also see here both the
meander pattern and this very

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.779
elaborate decoration around the
windows;

00:14:34.779 --> 00:14:39.144
a frame around the windows and
then a projecting element up

00:14:39.144 --> 00:14:43.360
above, with these great spiral
volutes on either side;

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.803
very similar to the same sort
of thing that was happening at

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:47.269
Ostia.
 

00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:50.804
I remind you of the niche in
the courtyard of the Horrea

00:14:50.804 --> 00:14:53.835
Epagathiana,
the warehouses at Ostia,

00:14:53.835 --> 00:14:59.082
where you see the same sort of
thing: these pilasters added in

00:14:59.082 --> 00:15:02.477
stucco,
the brickwork creating

00:15:02.477 --> 00:15:06.298
triangles and lozenges,
as you can see here.

00:15:06.298 --> 00:15:09.830
Same idea over here,
in the Tomb of Annia Regilla.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.469
And if you look very closely at
the pediment that is located

00:15:13.469 --> 00:15:15.812
above the niche,
from the tomb in Rome,

00:15:15.812 --> 00:15:18.278
you see the projecting
entablatures;

00:15:18.278 --> 00:15:21.120
you see where the capitals
would have been.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.423
There would also have been
probably columns added here,

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:27.605
on either side of the niche,
making it look much more

00:15:27.605 --> 00:15:28.830
similar to here.
 

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.330
But look closely at the
pediment.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.991
You will see that there is
projecting entablature above

00:15:33.991 --> 00:15:36.613
each column,
but then in the center the

00:15:36.613 --> 00:15:40.452
triangular pediment is cut back,
and that playing around with

00:15:40.452 --> 00:15:44.124
the traditional vocabulary of
architecture is something that

00:15:44.124 --> 00:15:47.796
I've noted is going to be a part
of what we call the baroque

00:15:47.796 --> 00:15:49.850
trend in Roman architecture.
 

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:53.232
I'm going to devote an entire
lecture to the baroque trend in

00:15:53.232 --> 00:15:55.320
Roman architecture,
around the Empire,

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.139
not just in Rome,
but mostly in the provinces.

00:15:58.139 --> 00:16:02.652
And we'll see that same sort of
thing, which creates a kind of

00:16:02.652 --> 00:16:07.015
in-and-out lively movement to
the façade that is part

00:16:07.015 --> 00:16:08.570
of that approach.
 

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.178
The tomb itself again.
 

00:16:11.178 --> 00:16:14.009
And just to point out,
interestingly enough,

00:16:14.009 --> 00:16:18.139
a couple of female figures with
capitals on the top of their

00:16:18.139 --> 00:16:20.149
head,
or what look maybe more like

00:16:20.149 --> 00:16:23.392
vases on the top of their head,
but looking very much like

00:16:23.392 --> 00:16:26.446
caryatids,
like the caryatids that we saw

00:16:26.446 --> 00:16:30.177
from the Erectheion in Athens,
fifth century B.C.,

00:16:30.177 --> 00:16:34.123
from the Forum of Augustus and
from Hadrian's Villa around the

00:16:34.123 --> 00:16:34.899
Serapeum.
 

00:16:34.899 --> 00:16:37.774
They are not duplicates of
those in Athens,

00:16:37.774 --> 00:16:40.993
like the other two are,
but they do seem to make

00:16:40.993 --> 00:16:42.500
reference to them.
 

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.769
They're a bit more casual.
 

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:46.601
When I look at this pair,
they always look to me like

00:16:46.601 --> 00:16:49.652
they're kind of standing at a
cocktail party together and

00:16:49.652 --> 00:16:53.195
conversing with one another,
using the usual gestures that

00:16:53.195 --> 00:16:54.879
Italians are so famous for.
 

00:16:54.879 --> 00:16:57.389
We see them doing that sort of
thing here.

00:16:57.389 --> 00:17:00.049
But they do seem to have that
same pedigree,

00:17:00.049 --> 00:17:03.019
going back to the whole idea of
the caryatids.

00:17:03.019 --> 00:17:05.471
And I only mention it to you,
they were found right near this

00:17:05.471 --> 00:17:07.277
tomb,
and so it has been speculated,

00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:09.098
although it is by no means
certain,

00:17:09.098 --> 00:17:11.259
that they might have belonged
to the tomb.

00:17:11.259 --> 00:17:14.355
They might have been located in
front of the tomb,

00:17:14.355 --> 00:17:18.085
or have been part of some kind
of forecourt or fore space to

00:17:18.085 --> 00:17:18.970
that tomb.
 

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.963
It's pure conjecture,
but it would be interesting if

00:17:21.963 --> 00:17:23.078
it were the case.
 

00:17:23.078 --> 00:17:25.778
Because remember Herodes
Atticus comes from Athens.

00:17:25.778 --> 00:17:29.625
We see that the tomb is a
thoroughly Roman tomb of the

00:17:29.625 --> 00:17:31.150
second century A.D.
 

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.285
But it would be interesting to
think that he might have added

00:17:34.285 --> 00:17:37.420
some touches that might have
made some reference for him,

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.829
and also especially for his
wife whose tomb it was,

00:17:39.829 --> 00:17:44.410
to the Athens of his birth.
 

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:51.108
With regard to tomb interiors
in the second century A.D.

00:17:51.108 --> 00:17:53.445
in Rome, there are two major
types, and I want to treat both

00:17:53.445 --> 00:17:54.118
of those today.
 

00:17:54.118 --> 00:17:57.048
One of them is a type that
we've seen before,

00:17:57.048 --> 00:18:01.108
and that is where you stucco
over the interior of the tomb;

00:18:01.108 --> 00:18:04.955
you stucco it over,
and then you add additional

00:18:04.955 --> 00:18:08.384
stucco, in relief,
to form the decoration,

00:18:08.384 --> 00:18:10.559
and then you paint it.
 

00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:11.980
That's one type.
 

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:16.019
And the second type,
which might also use that for

00:18:16.019 --> 00:18:18.170
the vault;
but for the walls,

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:21.910
the second type is to use
instead architectural members--

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:26.430
columns, pediments and the
like--to enliven the wall and to

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.470
create a much more sculptural
effect.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:33.420
Both of these types are used in
Rome, in the second century A.D.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.660
in tomb architecture.
 

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:38.108
And I want to show you examples
of both of them today.

00:18:38.108 --> 00:18:40.290
The first, type 1,
with stucco,

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.635
painted stucco,
we see in the so-called Tomb of

00:18:43.635 --> 00:18:47.561
the Valerii;
the Tomb of the Valerii which

00:18:47.561 --> 00:18:49.467
dates to around A.D.
 

00:18:49.467 --> 00:18:54.038
159, and is located on the Via
Latina in Rome.

00:18:54.038 --> 00:18:56.808
We haven't looked at the Via
Latina before,

00:18:56.808 --> 00:19:00.460
but it is one of Rome's main
streets,

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.854
that had along it cemeteries,
and there are a fair number of

00:19:03.854 --> 00:19:05.681
concrete tombs,
faced with brick,

00:19:05.681 --> 00:19:09.114
that are preserved,
very well preserved on the Via

00:19:09.114 --> 00:19:10.259
Latina today.
 

00:19:10.259 --> 00:19:14.240
And what makes them
particularly special is the

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.009
interiors are almost pristine.
 

00:19:17.009 --> 00:19:19.637
It's quite extraordinary to go
into these and see how well they

00:19:19.637 --> 00:19:20.910
have stood the test of time.
 

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:24.298
The Tomb of the Valerii,
you see the lunette and the

00:19:24.298 --> 00:19:27.490
vault of the interior of that
tomb right here.

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:32.580
And as you look at the acanthus
leaves growing up in the

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.961
lunette,
all done in stucco relief,

00:19:35.961 --> 00:19:41.048
and the barrel vault with its
individual compartments,

00:19:41.048 --> 00:19:43.118
round and square compartments,
with floating figures inside,

00:19:43.118 --> 00:19:46.125
you should certainly be
reminded of things we've already

00:19:46.125 --> 00:19:46.890
seen before.
 

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.259
When one looks at the acanthus
leaves,

00:19:48.259 --> 00:19:51.633
one can't help but think back
to the delicate leaves of the

00:19:51.633 --> 00:19:54.060
Ara Pacis,
the delicate acanthus leaves of

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:58.222
the Ara Pacis Augustae,
which you see on the left-hand

00:19:58.222 --> 00:20:00.098
side of the screen.
 

00:20:00.098 --> 00:20:02.142
And I'm sure you are as
reminded as I am,

00:20:02.142 --> 00:20:04.695
looking at this vault,
by other things that we have

00:20:04.695 --> 00:20:06.279
seen earlier this semester.
 

00:20:06.279 --> 00:20:09.500
What's this over here?
 

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.449
The Domus Aurea;
it's one of the vaults of the

00:20:11.449 --> 00:20:11.920
Domus Aurea.
 

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.297
Third style;
done, we believe,

00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:16.160
by Fabullus himself.
 

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.523
And you'll recall,
very delicate,

00:20:18.523 --> 00:20:21.249
very light floral motifs;
compartments,

00:20:21.249 --> 00:20:24.334
in this case rectangular,
with floating sea creatures in

00:20:24.334 --> 00:20:25.118
the center.
 

00:20:25.118 --> 00:20:28.604
We see exactly the same sort of
thing here, although done in

00:20:28.604 --> 00:20:30.140
stucco instead of paint.
 

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:33.250
But this was painted originally
in antiquity,

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:37.067
and we see these floating,
these Nereids on the back of

00:20:37.067 --> 00:20:40.460
sea creatures inside,
floating inside these.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:44.426
And we think the message here,
of course, is of the soul of

00:20:44.426 --> 00:20:48.053
the deceased being carried to
the Iles of the Blessed,

00:20:48.053 --> 00:20:49.900
by these sea creatures.
 

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.180
So very much stucco decoration,
second century A.D.,

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:58.246
but very dependent on Third
Style Roman wall painting and

00:20:58.246 --> 00:21:02.680
third style stucco decoration of
earlier dates.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.991
The Tomb of the Pancratii,
in Rome, which dates to 169,

00:21:06.991 --> 00:21:11.065
also on the Via Latina,
has similarly well preserved

00:21:11.065 --> 00:21:13.940
stucco decoration,
also painted;

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:17.087
and I'll show you a color view
in a moment, for you to get a

00:21:17.087 --> 00:21:18.528
sense of that coloration.
 

00:21:18.528 --> 00:21:21.797
But here you get an idea of the
scheme of the wall:

00:21:21.797 --> 00:21:24.630
very, very elaborate;
stuccoed over;

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.900
stuccoed, much of the stucco is
done in relief.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.230
You can see it here.
 

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:32.407
If the stucco decoration of the
Tomb of the Valerii made

00:21:32.407 --> 00:21:36.717
reference to the Third Style,
I think the inspiration here

00:21:36.717 --> 00:21:40.740
was Fourth Style Roman wall
painting and stucco decoration.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:44.017
Because although you continue
to see floating mythological

00:21:44.017 --> 00:21:47.410
figures in these rectangular or
triangular compartments,

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:50.640
if you look very closely,
especially in this zone here,

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.548
you will also see these
architectural cages,

00:21:53.548 --> 00:21:56.573
done in stucco,
very similar to the

00:21:56.573 --> 00:22:02.175
architectural cages that we saw
at the top of Fourth Style Roman

00:22:02.175 --> 00:22:03.598
wall design.
 

00:22:03.598 --> 00:22:06.304
So this taking its cue from
Fourth Style Roman wall

00:22:06.304 --> 00:22:06.900
painting.
 

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.472
And I have mentioned to you a
couple of times already this

00:22:09.472 --> 00:22:12.204
term that,
in fact, most post-Pompeian

00:22:12.204 --> 00:22:14.761
painting,
and stucco decoration,

00:22:14.761 --> 00:22:18.266
post-79 A.D.,
does seem to be inspired by the

00:22:18.266 --> 00:22:21.443
third style,
but even more so by the fourth

00:22:21.443 --> 00:22:25.711
style of Roman wall painting,
and we see that very well here,

00:22:25.711 --> 00:22:30.009
with this stucco decorating the
lunettes and also the vaulting.

00:22:30.009 --> 00:22:34.384
Here's a view in color of the
interior of the Tomb of the

00:22:34.384 --> 00:22:37.464
Pancratii,
where you can see the same sort

00:22:37.464 --> 00:22:40.130
of scheme that I've already
described,

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:41.538
but with the color.
 

00:22:41.538 --> 00:22:44.519
And you can also see that we
are dealing here with a

00:22:44.519 --> 00:22:45.980
groin-vaulted interior.
 

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:50.041
And, what's interesting,
is that sometimes the walls

00:22:50.041 --> 00:22:55.220
have small niches for urns and
the so-called arcosolia--

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.640
I've mentioned those to you
before--

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.769
that were used for the
placement of bodies,

00:22:59.769 --> 00:23:02.973
once inhumation became as
popular, indeed even more

00:23:02.973 --> 00:23:05.430
popular,
than cremation.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:09.182
But we also sometimes see the
sarcophagi themselves,

00:23:09.182 --> 00:23:12.641
the freestanding coffins
located in these tombs,

00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:14.038
as we see here.
 

00:23:14.038 --> 00:23:17.375
And it's interesting to keep in
mind that all of the money and

00:23:17.375 --> 00:23:20.328
time that was expended on this
interior decoration--

00:23:20.328 --> 00:23:23.680
keep in mind that very few
people entered into these tombs.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.548
When you looked at a tomb,
you saw primarily its exterior.

00:23:26.548 --> 00:23:28.967
Some family members,
on special occasions,

00:23:28.967 --> 00:23:31.680
might go inside,
but it was relatively rare.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.034
So all of this,
all of this done,

00:23:33.034 --> 00:23:36.689
in fact,
to give the deceased a pleasant

00:23:36.689 --> 00:23:40.144
home in perpetuity,
and to help them on their

00:23:40.144 --> 00:23:42.058
journey to the Isles of the
Blessed.

00:23:42.058 --> 00:23:46.358
This structure also has sea
creatures depicted in it.

00:23:46.358 --> 00:23:48.769
So travel is clearly also
alluded to.

00:23:48.769 --> 00:23:51.900
And scholars who have worked on
this particular monument,

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.366
in particular,
have noted that they think it

00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:57.578
has to do with one of these
secret mystery religions,

00:23:57.578 --> 00:24:00.660
in this case the Orphic,
O-r-p-h-i-c,

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:04.637
the Orphic religion that was
practiced in secret initially

00:24:04.637 --> 00:24:07.640
and then eventually came up
above ground.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.326
Two more details of the
Pancratii ceilings,

00:24:11.326 --> 00:24:12.380
in stucco.
 

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.699
These, I think,
give you a particularly good

00:24:14.699 --> 00:24:18.259
sense of the way in which they
were built up almost as reliefs,

00:24:18.259 --> 00:24:22.769
in some parts of these scenes
-- this figure here,

00:24:22.769 --> 00:24:24.019
for example.
 

00:24:24.019 --> 00:24:27.009
Some of the rest was painted.
 

00:24:27.009 --> 00:24:29.720
We see heraldic leopards over
here, on either side of a vase.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.296
The shell in the niche also
done in stucco and raised in a

00:24:33.296 --> 00:24:37.405
very sculptural way,
and then the whole painted in a

00:24:37.405 --> 00:24:41.880
variety of attractive maroons
and blues and greens.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:46.250
The most interesting tomb,
from my point of view actually,

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:50.394
is a tomb that is located,
a Roman tomb of the second

00:24:50.394 --> 00:24:54.538
century that is located beneath
the Vatican today.

00:24:54.538 --> 00:24:57.932
And I show you a view again of
the dome of St.

00:24:57.932 --> 00:25:01.703
Peter's Cathedral in Rome,
designed by Michelangelo

00:25:01.703 --> 00:25:02.608
himself.
 

00:25:02.608 --> 00:25:06.710
Another view over here showing
also Michelangelo's dome,

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:10.866
but showing below it the
so-called Baldacchino that was

00:25:10.866 --> 00:25:14.484
put up by the famous
seventeenth-century Italian

00:25:14.484 --> 00:25:18.290
architect,
Borromini, Francesco Borromini

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:20.236
, the Cathedral of St.
 

00:25:20.236 --> 00:25:21.118
Peter's.
 

00:25:21.118 --> 00:25:23.310
And any of you who've been
there will agree with me on

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:25.420
this, it's one of the great
wonders of the world;

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.038
there's no question it is.
 

00:25:27.038 --> 00:25:29.464
If you want to talk about
bigger is better,

00:25:29.464 --> 00:25:31.949
or biggest is best,
this is a truly colossal

00:25:31.949 --> 00:25:35.009
building, as any of you who have
been there know.

00:25:35.009 --> 00:25:37.220
But it does give me occasion to
mention,

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.618
as I've mentioned a couple of
times already this term,

00:25:39.618 --> 00:25:42.400
that one of the really great
things to do when you visit Rome

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.690
is to climb things,
is to climb.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.944
If you're so lucky to climb the
Column of Trajan,

00:25:46.944 --> 00:25:49.106
or the Pantheon,
up to the dome--those you have

00:25:49.106 --> 00:25:50.798
to get special permission to do.
 

00:25:50.798 --> 00:25:53.472
But what you don't need special
permission to do,

00:25:53.472 --> 00:25:56.480
and is one of the great climbs
in Rome, is to go up St.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.150
Peter's.
 

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:58.077
And you can go up St.
 

00:25:58.077 --> 00:26:00.200
Peter's either on the outside
of the building,

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:04.196
to various levels from which
you can see some of the greatest

00:26:04.196 --> 00:26:06.898
views of Rome,
including back over central

00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:09.244
Rome, ancient Rome,
all the buildings that we've

00:26:09.244 --> 00:26:10.048
been talking about.
 

00:26:10.048 --> 00:26:12.358
You can see the dome of the
Pantheon from the top of St.

00:26:12.358 --> 00:26:12.778
Peter's.
 

00:26:12.778 --> 00:26:16.145
You can see the Victor Emmanuel
Monument, tall and proud,

00:26:16.145 --> 00:26:17.347
from the dome of St.
 

00:26:17.347 --> 00:26:18.009
Peter's.
 

00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:21.564
But you can also climb up to
the dome, from the inside,

00:26:21.564 --> 00:26:24.460
which is another extraordinary
experience.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:28.512
You can go almost--not quite
but almost--to the apex of

00:26:28.512 --> 00:26:32.192
Michelangelo's dome,
walk around a corridor there,

00:26:32.192 --> 00:26:35.420
and look down on Bernini's
Baldacchino.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:39.077
So for those of you who are
going to Rome anytime soon,

00:26:39.077 --> 00:26:41.788
or in the future,
it's a not to be missed

00:26:41.788 --> 00:26:44.431
experience to climb the
Cathedral of St.

00:26:44.431 --> 00:26:48.088
Peter's, on the outside,
and also on the inside.

00:26:48.088 --> 00:26:49.665
I bring you to St.
 

00:26:49.665 --> 00:26:54.046
Peter's because one can also go
down underneath St.

00:26:54.046 --> 00:26:55.009
Peter's.
 

00:26:55.009 --> 00:26:57.166
And that's another very
interesting experience,

00:26:57.166 --> 00:26:58.855
to go down in the depths,
beneath St.

00:26:58.855 --> 00:27:01.434
Peter's and get a really great
sense of the centuries of

00:27:01.434 --> 00:27:04.390
civilization that have been
piled one on top of another,

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:06.670
from ancient Rome,
or from the time of Romulus,

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:09.858
indeed all the way up to today.
 

00:27:09.858 --> 00:27:12.442
And in order to see the Tomb of
the Caetennii,

00:27:12.442 --> 00:27:14.969
which is the tomb that I want
to turn to now,

00:27:14.969 --> 00:27:17.036
you do have to go down
underneath St.

00:27:17.036 --> 00:27:17.838
Peter's.
 

00:27:17.838 --> 00:27:20.568
You have to--this is something
you can't just walk it.

00:27:20.568 --> 00:27:21.404
You can climb St.
 

00:27:21.404 --> 00:27:23.814
Peter's any day of the week,
but if you want to go

00:27:23.814 --> 00:27:24.501
underneath St.
 

00:27:24.501 --> 00:27:27.009
Peter's, you have to make
special arrangements.

00:27:27.009 --> 00:27:29.549
You have to get special tickets
to do that.

00:27:29.549 --> 00:27:33.519
And now one can do that online;
you can plan that online and

00:27:33.519 --> 00:27:38.059
you can get tickets to go to the
so-called Vatican cemeteries

00:27:38.059 --> 00:27:39.118
underneath.
 

00:27:39.118 --> 00:27:42.068
And they don't have them--they
have a small number of hours,

00:27:42.068 --> 00:27:43.220
on a variety of days.
 

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:47.140
So it is something one needs to
plan for well in advance.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.259
But you can do it.
 

00:27:48.259 --> 00:27:50.816
You go to the left of the
Baldacchino, you go down,

00:27:50.816 --> 00:27:52.808
and you go down century upon
century.

00:27:52.808 --> 00:27:56.365
You see primarily the tombs of
the popes, the crypts with the

00:27:56.365 --> 00:27:57.608
tombs of the popes.
 

00:27:57.608 --> 00:28:00.590
And I show you Pope Boniface
here, just to give you an idea

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:05.106
of what some of these look like,
lying in eternity here on the

00:28:05.106 --> 00:28:09.558
top of his sarcophagus,
or a sculptured portrait of him

00:28:09.558 --> 00:28:11.670
on the top of his sarcophagus.
 

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.078
But if you go all the way down,
all the way down--

00:28:14.078 --> 00:28:16.127
and most tourists don't do
this--but if you go all the way

00:28:16.127 --> 00:28:18.592
to the bottom,
what you end up with is one of

00:28:18.592 --> 00:28:20.259
Rome's great tomb streets.
 

00:28:20.259 --> 00:28:23.440
And this tomb street was out in
the light of day,

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.392
of course, in antiquity,
like all the other tomb

00:28:25.392 --> 00:28:28.080
streets,
but because of the passage of

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.153
time,
because other buildings that

00:28:30.153 --> 00:28:33.605
were built on top,
primarily the Cathedral of St.

00:28:33.605 --> 00:28:37.607
Peter's, and just the rising
ground level over time,

00:28:37.607 --> 00:28:39.650
it now is subterranean.
 

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:40.890
But when you--it's amazing.
 

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:42.945
You go down,
you walk along it,

00:28:42.945 --> 00:28:46.852
it is like you are--it's a dark
street, but nonetheless--I

00:28:46.852 --> 00:28:49.799
wouldn't want to record in that
street.

00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:52.190
But you go down under.
 

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:55.540
It's a dark street but it
is--you feel like you are

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.490
walking along a major tomb
street in Rome;

00:28:58.490 --> 00:28:59.509
and indeed you are.
 

00:28:59.509 --> 00:29:04.068
And I show you a plan of it
here, so that you can see.

00:29:04.068 --> 00:29:05.537
It is very much like walking
along the tomb street in Isola

00:29:05.537 --> 00:29:05.740
Sacra.
 

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:08.950
You see at your left and right
these concrete,

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:11.877
brick-faced tombs,
that look very much like the

00:29:11.877 --> 00:29:15.528
Tomb of Annia Regilla,
or the ones that we saw in

00:29:15.528 --> 00:29:20.278
Isola Sacra: typical house tombs
of the second century A.D.

00:29:20.278 --> 00:29:25.204
One of the tombs that is
located down there has long been

00:29:25.204 --> 00:29:28.194
thought by scholars,
and believers,

00:29:28.194 --> 00:29:30.041
to be the Tomb of St.
 

00:29:30.041 --> 00:29:31.009
Peter.
 

00:29:31.009 --> 00:29:34.199
No one has been able to prove
this incontrovertibly,

00:29:34.199 --> 00:29:37.890
but there is some interesting
evidence, both pro and con.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:41.439
And it has been thought--and
you know Peter's famous

00:29:41.439 --> 00:29:45.474
statement, Upon this rock I
shall build this church,

00:29:45.474 --> 00:29:47.144
namely the Church of St.
 

00:29:47.144 --> 00:29:48.048
Peter's.
 

00:29:48.048 --> 00:29:51.962
We believe that when
Constantine, the last pagan

00:29:51.962 --> 00:29:54.124
emperor--
and we're going to talk about

00:29:54.124 --> 00:29:55.838
him in the last lecture this
semester--

00:29:55.838 --> 00:29:59.019
when Constantine built the
first basilica,

00:29:59.019 --> 00:30:03.474
Christian basilica on this
site, the basilica that we refer

00:30:03.474 --> 00:30:04.472
to as Old St.
 

00:30:04.472 --> 00:30:07.469
Peter's, that obviously
predated New St.

00:30:07.469 --> 00:30:12.000
Peter's, we think he may have
built it on that very rock and

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.844
on that very tomb of St.
 

00:30:13.844 --> 00:30:14.920
Peter.
 

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:19.588
And that's what this restored
view shows you here.

00:30:19.588 --> 00:30:22.130
If you walk along though and
look at these tombs,

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:25.028
for the most part they look
like typical Roman tombs from

00:30:25.028 --> 00:30:27.048
the second century:
brick-faced concrete

00:30:27.048 --> 00:30:29.978
construction,
with interesting decoration

00:30:29.978 --> 00:30:30.568
inside.
 

00:30:30.568 --> 00:30:33.611
And I show you just the most
famous mosaic that is located

00:30:33.611 --> 00:30:36.440
down there, which you see is a
figure in a chariot.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:39.472
We think it's a representation
of the Sun God Sol or Helios,

00:30:39.472 --> 00:30:41.734
in the chariot,
because you can see the rayed

00:30:41.734 --> 00:30:42.250
crown.
 

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:45.930
But some believe it is a
representation of Christ as

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:46.578
Helios.
 

00:30:46.578 --> 00:30:49.701
And I show it to you only
because it is the single most

00:30:49.701 --> 00:30:52.430
famous mosaic down there,
and one of the most famous

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:54.953
mosaics in Rome,
but also because it heralds

00:30:54.953 --> 00:30:57.880
what we're going to begin to see
happening,

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.207
especially in the last lecture,
and that is this transition

00:31:01.207 --> 00:31:03.558
from paganism to Christianity in
Rome--

00:31:03.558 --> 00:31:06.509
Constantine being the last
pagan, first Christian emperor--

00:31:06.509 --> 00:31:11.068
and this interesting way in
which pagan imagery elides into

00:31:11.068 --> 00:31:14.380
Christian imagery,
both in terms of figural

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:17.315
decoration,
but also in terms of

00:31:17.315 --> 00:31:18.740
architecture.
 

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:22.210
I can't, because it's so poorly
lighted down there,

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:26.027
I can't show you a good picture
of the tombs beneath St.

00:31:26.027 --> 00:31:26.858
Peter's.
 

00:31:26.858 --> 00:31:30.759
But I can show you another set
of tombs beneath a--

00:31:30.759 --> 00:31:33.519
that are very well lighted and
can be photographed better--

00:31:33.519 --> 00:31:37.190
beneath a columbarium,
an underground--

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:41.117
a catacomb actually,
an underground burial area that

00:31:41.117 --> 00:31:44.430
was used by the early Christians
in Rome.

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.269
And you see it's called--you
don't have to worry about

00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:49.736
this--it's called the Church of
San Sebastiano,

00:31:49.736 --> 00:31:51.880
and these tombs are underneath
that.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.229
But I show them to you here,
just to give you a sense of

00:31:54.229 --> 00:31:55.808
what that tomb street looked
like,

00:31:55.808 --> 00:31:58.186
underneath the Vatican,
or looks like underneath the

00:31:58.186 --> 00:32:00.784
Vatican,
with the concrete brick-faced

00:32:00.784 --> 00:32:03.144
tombs,
looking very similar to those

00:32:03.144 --> 00:32:04.558
we saw at Isola Sacra.
 

00:32:04.558 --> 00:32:07.952
The same travertine door jambs,
inscriptions,

00:32:07.952 --> 00:32:09.108
slit windows.
 

00:32:09.108 --> 00:32:13.009
And if you look through the
entranceway of this one,

00:32:13.009 --> 00:32:15.439
you will see it's barrel
vaulted, and it has a scheme

00:32:15.439 --> 00:32:18.194
that is very similar to the
stucco decoration of the Tomb of

00:32:18.194 --> 00:32:21.221
the Valerii,
with these circles done in

00:32:21.221 --> 00:32:25.772
raised stucco and with the
floating figures in between

00:32:25.772 --> 00:32:26.460
them.
 

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:30.210
And this is exactly what it
looks like beneath the Vatican.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:33.234
I can show you some views of
the interiors of some of the

00:32:33.234 --> 00:32:35.502
Vatican tombs,
because those have lights in

00:32:35.502 --> 00:32:36.920
them;
they're better lighted.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.358
You can see them here.
 

00:32:38.358 --> 00:32:40.348
We see this interesting
combination,

00:32:40.348 --> 00:32:44.454
that we also saw at Isola
Sacra, of the smaller niches

00:32:44.454 --> 00:32:48.267
that are used for urns,
and the larger arcosolia

00:32:48.267 --> 00:32:50.759
that are used for the placement
of bodies.

00:32:50.759 --> 00:32:53.130
And then you can see,
in this view on the right,

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:55.652
the way in which they have
closed off those

00:32:55.652 --> 00:32:58.895
arcosolia by placing
marble plaques on them that

00:32:58.895 --> 00:33:02.380
either have inscriptions or
sometimes figural scenes,

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:06.394
and then again here a
freestanding sarcophagi on these

00:33:06.394 --> 00:33:07.910
interiors as well.
 

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:11.338
This is an axonometric view
from Ward-Perkins of the Tomb of

00:33:11.338 --> 00:33:12.269
the Caetennii.
 

00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:15.715
It dates to 160 A.D.,
in the Vatican Cemetery in

00:33:15.715 --> 00:33:16.230
Rome.
 

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:20.531
And I think you can see here
both the brick-faced concrete

00:33:20.531 --> 00:33:23.324
construction,
the way in which the windows

00:33:23.324 --> 00:33:26.661
have similar stucco decoration
to what we saw on the Tomb of

00:33:26.661 --> 00:33:29.759
Annia Regilla,
on the Via Appia in Rome.

00:33:29.759 --> 00:33:33.555
But most interesting for us is
the way in which the interior is

00:33:33.555 --> 00:33:35.818
treated, because this is my type
2.

00:33:35.818 --> 00:33:39.471
Here we will see some stucco,
but you will see here that the

00:33:39.471 --> 00:33:42.009
walls are enlivened in a
different way.

00:33:42.009 --> 00:33:45.420
They are enlivened through
architectonic means,

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:47.750
through the use of columns,
through the use of niches,

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:50.380
through the use of pediments,
triangular pediments,

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.630
but also broken triangular
pediments.

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:56.660
Here you see a pediment that
has been split apart,

00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:00.308
a triangular pediment split
apart to show what is inside.

00:34:00.308 --> 00:34:04.067
This is the same scheme that we
saw in Second Style Roman wall

00:34:04.067 --> 00:34:07.784
painting, way back when;
this whole idea of taking the

00:34:07.784 --> 00:34:11.940
traditional vocabulary of
architecture and dealing with it

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:15.949
in a very different way than had
been done before --

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:19.019
breaking the rules so to speak.
 

00:34:19.019 --> 00:34:20.518
We see that happening here.
 

00:34:20.518 --> 00:34:24.206
But the main thing is that
we're looking at this designer

00:34:24.206 --> 00:34:28.088
using architectural members to
create the visual interest of

00:34:28.088 --> 00:34:30.130
the walls of the structure.
 

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:33.443
You can also see in this
axonometric view this

00:34:33.443 --> 00:34:36.757
combination of small niches for
cinerary urns,

00:34:36.757 --> 00:34:41.030
and then these larger
arcosolia for the bodies.

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:45.030
So cremation and inhumation
still going on hand in hand,

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:47.360
during the second century A.D.
 

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:51.034
This is a spectacular view of
the interior of the Tomb of the

00:34:51.034 --> 00:34:54.280
Caetennii, and here you can
really see what I mean.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.530
Yes, there is some stucco.
 

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:57.190
If you look at the vaults you
will see that those--

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:00.789
this is again a groin vault
that has been stuccoed over,

00:35:00.789 --> 00:35:06.572
and it had the same kind of
compartments and painted

00:35:06.572 --> 00:35:09.411
decoration,
relief decoration,

00:35:09.411 --> 00:35:12.329
that we saw in the Tomb of the
Pancratii.

00:35:12.329 --> 00:35:15.724
But you can see that most of
the effects have been done

00:35:15.724 --> 00:35:17.610
through architectural means.
 

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:20.161
If you look carefully you will
see that there is a

00:35:20.161 --> 00:35:22.139
black-and-white mosaic on the
floor;

00:35:22.139 --> 00:35:24.469
not so different from what we
see in Ostia.

00:35:24.469 --> 00:35:28.427
There are niches on the walls,
these niches used for cinerary

00:35:28.427 --> 00:35:30.967
urns;
arcosolia down here for

00:35:30.967 --> 00:35:31.800
the bodies.
 

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.817
And there are stuccoed
decoration and the use of the

00:35:35.817 --> 00:35:38.260
shells that you can see here.
 

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:41.400
But if you look very carefully
at the combination of sort of

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.878
maroon and cherry red walls,
you will see the remains of the

00:35:44.878 --> 00:35:48.239
architectural members that
served to enliven this space.

00:35:48.239 --> 00:35:50.826
Look up here;
you will see that there was a

00:35:50.826 --> 00:35:52.900
triangular pediment over the
central niche.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:57.393
You can see parts of the broken
triangular pediments on either

00:35:57.393 --> 00:35:57.909
side.
 

00:35:57.909 --> 00:36:00.998
You can see the remains of
capitals, and beneath those

00:36:00.998 --> 00:36:04.262
would have been the projecting
columns that we saw in the

00:36:04.262 --> 00:36:06.420
axonometric view in
Ward-Perkins.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.389
So this again the second type,
where the walls are enlivened

00:36:09.389 --> 00:36:12.099
with architectural members,
and those architectural

00:36:12.099 --> 00:36:15.036
members, when intact,
would have created a scheme in

00:36:15.036 --> 00:36:17.867
which you had progression,
recession, progression,

00:36:17.867 --> 00:36:19.599
recession, all along the wall
--

00:36:19.599 --> 00:36:23.175
this in and out scheme that
we're going to see becomes the

00:36:23.175 --> 00:36:26.690
hallmark of what I'm going to
term here this semester the

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:29.199
baroque element in Roman
antiquity,

00:36:29.199 --> 00:36:31.110
in Roman architecture.
 

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:35.094
All of these buildings were
being put up during the reign of

00:36:35.094 --> 00:36:36.579
Hadrian's successor.
 

00:36:36.579 --> 00:36:41.681
Hadrian had died in 138 A.D.,
and he was succeeded by a man

00:36:41.681 --> 00:36:46.960
by the name of Antoninus Pius,
whose portrait you see here on

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.719
the upper right.
 

00:36:48.719 --> 00:36:54.750
Antoninus Pius again was--he
reigned for a quite long time.

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:58.840
He reigned between 138 and 161
A.D.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.539
It was a period of
extraordinary peace.

00:37:01.539 --> 00:37:03.994
He, like Hadrian,
was a peace loving man,

00:37:03.994 --> 00:37:07.371
and he was able to maintain
that peace exceedingly well,

00:37:07.371 --> 00:37:10.440
and Rome really thrived under
his emperorship.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:14.449
He's also interesting because
he seems to have had more of a

00:37:14.449 --> 00:37:18.460
love relationship with his wife
than any other Roman emperor

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.931
that I can think of,
a relationship that was so

00:37:21.931 --> 00:37:25.572
strong that when his wife died--
he became emperor--here's his

00:37:25.572 --> 00:37:27.650
wife,
Faustina the Elder.

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:32.601
He became emperor in 138,
but she died already in 141,

00:37:32.601 --> 00:37:37.179
and as I mentioned he stayed
emperor until 161;

00:37:37.179 --> 00:37:39.630
so he was emperor for twenty
more years after her death.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:41.070
He never forgot her.
 

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:44.590
He stayed completely enamored
of her.

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:45.800
He never remarried.
 

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.742
We don't even have any rumors
that he had any concubines or

00:37:49.742 --> 00:37:51.170
anything like that.
 

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:54.860
He seems to have stayed
completely true to her.

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:58.972
And what's interesting is that
when the two of them died,

00:37:58.972 --> 00:38:02.132
their successors,
Marcus Aurelius and Lucius

00:38:02.132 --> 00:38:04.849
Verus, put up a monument to
them.

00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:07.179
And it's not on your Monument
List and I'm not holding you

00:38:07.179 --> 00:38:09.512
responsible for it,
but I just want to show it to

00:38:09.512 --> 00:38:12.474
you, because it will illuminate
a monument that I am going to

00:38:12.474 --> 00:38:13.659
show you in a moment.
 

00:38:13.659 --> 00:38:19.550
This base, which served as the
base for a porphyry column,

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:24.876
that was located on top,
represents a scene in which we

00:38:24.876 --> 00:38:29.679
see Antoninus Pius and his wife,
Faustina the Elder,

00:38:29.679 --> 00:38:34.159
being carried to heaven on the
back of a male personification.

00:38:34.159 --> 00:38:36.221
We see Roma,
in the bottom right,

00:38:36.221 --> 00:38:40.324
and she is saluting them;
she is bearing witness to what

00:38:40.324 --> 00:38:44.190
is a representation of their
joint divinization.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:46.795
The two of them,
Faustina the Elder,

00:38:46.795 --> 00:38:51.887
divinized at her death in 141;
Antoninus Pius divinized at his

00:38:51.887 --> 00:38:53.110
death in 161.
 

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:56.452
And yet we see them being
carried to heaven as if their

00:38:56.452 --> 00:38:59.550
divinizations happened exactly
at the same time.

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:01.130
This is obviously a fiction.
 

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:03.309
It is a conflation of time.
 

00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:07.646
It is a fiction of which the
Romans were particularly adept

00:39:07.646 --> 00:39:10.489
in their sculptural
representations.

00:39:10.489 --> 00:39:15.085
But I show it to you here
because it has some bearing on a

00:39:15.085 --> 00:39:18.230
temple that I now want to talk
about.

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:22.108
This is the so-called Temple of
Antoninus Pius and Faustina the

00:39:22.108 --> 00:39:22.610
Elder.
 

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:26.929
It is a temple that Antoninus
Pius put up in honor of his wife

00:39:26.929 --> 00:39:31.110
in 141, to her as a diva,
after she was divinized.

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:34.369
But at his own death,
twenty years later,

00:39:34.369 --> 00:39:38.221
in 161, his successors--again,
Marcus Aurelius and Lucius

00:39:38.221 --> 00:39:41.079
Verus--
rededicated it to the two of

00:39:41.079 --> 00:39:46.119
them, to the divine Antoninus
Pius and to the divine Faustina.

00:39:46.119 --> 00:39:49.815
It is quite well preserved
today, and it is important for

00:39:49.815 --> 00:39:51.070
two main reasons.
 

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:55.860
It is important because it is
our best surviving temple that

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:59.268
was put up to an emperor and an
empress.

00:39:59.268 --> 00:40:02.152
It wasn't the only one,
but it's the best surviving

00:40:02.152 --> 00:40:03.190
example of that.
 

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:07.929
And it is another example of
the way in which antiquities are

00:40:07.929 --> 00:40:12.059
reused over time,
in other contexts and at later

00:40:12.059 --> 00:40:15.400
times,
and how that reuse sometimes

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.679
helps to preserve them.
 

00:40:17.679 --> 00:40:20.309
What I show you now on the
screen is a coin,

00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:23.547
on the upper left,
representing Faustina the Elder

00:40:23.547 --> 00:40:26.554
on the obverse of the coin,
on the left,

00:40:26.554 --> 00:40:29.630
her portrait,
and it refers to her as

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:32.110
"Diva Faustina."
 

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:35.606
So it is a coin that Antoninus
Pius struck after her death and

00:40:35.606 --> 00:40:37.039
after her divinization.
 

00:40:37.039 --> 00:40:39.465
And we see on the back the
temple that Antoninus Pius

00:40:39.465 --> 00:40:40.960
originally made,
in her honor.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.090
Over here we see a series of
drawings,

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:46.599
that come from the Ward-Perkins
textbook,

00:40:46.599 --> 00:40:50.097
that show once again a
depiction of that original

00:40:50.097 --> 00:40:53.112
temple on the coin,
and with a legend that says

00:40:53.112 --> 00:40:55.067
aeternitas,
for eternity,

00:40:55.067 --> 00:40:57.860
because now she is a diva for
eternity.

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:01.643
And then a restored view,
over here, of what the temple

00:41:01.643 --> 00:41:05.918
would've looked like after it
was rededicated to Antoninus and

00:41:05.918 --> 00:41:07.389
Faustina, in 161.
 

00:41:07.389 --> 00:41:11.635
And then over here,
the Baroque building that was

00:41:11.635 --> 00:41:15.009
built into it,
in the seventeenth century

00:41:15.009 --> 00:41:19.106
A.D., when it was turned into
the Church of San Lorenzo in

00:41:19.106 --> 00:41:21.793
Miranda,
and I've put the name San

00:41:21.793 --> 00:41:24.860
Lorenzo in Miranda on your
Monument List.

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:28.271
If we look at the view of it,
as it was after it was

00:41:28.271 --> 00:41:31.150
re-dedicated to Antoninus Pius
and Faustina,

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:33.760
we will see a typical Roman
temple.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.393
All the features that we have
described so very often in the

00:41:37.393 --> 00:41:39.980
course of this semester--the
deep porch;

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.130
the freestanding columns in the
porch;

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:45.460
the very tall podium;
the single staircase;

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:50.070
the façade emphasis--we
see all of that here.

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:54.202
A very conventional Roman
temple, with sculpture in the

00:41:54.202 --> 00:41:58.869
pediment and decoration on the
eaves of the temple as well.

00:41:58.869 --> 00:42:02.387
What we see on the bottom left
is what happened to this temple

00:42:02.387 --> 00:42:04.059
in the seventeenth century.
 

00:42:04.059 --> 00:42:06.963
Part of it was preserved--maybe
more of it was preserved,

00:42:06.963 --> 00:42:09.713
we're not absolutely sure--but
at least part of it was

00:42:09.713 --> 00:42:10.440
preserved.
 

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:15.409
The walls, the sidewalls,
and also the columns and the

00:42:15.409 --> 00:42:19.481
front of the--
well the sidewalls primarily,

00:42:19.481 --> 00:42:23.228
and the columns,
and the lintel over here that

00:42:23.228 --> 00:42:26.711
has the inscription that
dedicates the temple to

00:42:26.711 --> 00:42:29.010
Antoninus Pius and Faustina.
 

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:31.476
But what you see behind it is
the Baroque façade rising

00:42:31.476 --> 00:42:33.324
up,
a Baroque façade that

00:42:33.324 --> 00:42:35.501
has buttresses--
and I'm going to show it to you

00:42:35.501 --> 00:42:38.063
in actuality in a moment--
that has buttresses on either

00:42:38.063 --> 00:42:40.404
side,
that has this wonderful split,

00:42:40.404 --> 00:42:43.304
arcuated pediment--
a split, arcuated pediment that

00:42:43.304 --> 00:42:45.300
would've been impossible to
conceive,

00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:47.500
I believe, without these
architects,

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.710
Baroque architects of
seventeenth century,

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:53.449
looking back to the baroque
element in Roman antiquity.

00:42:53.449 --> 00:42:57.400
The cross is added in the
center, of course.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.911
But there's one major
difference between this building

00:42:59.911 --> 00:43:00.860
and this building.
 

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:05.634
Does anyone see what that is,
besides the addition of the

00:43:05.634 --> 00:43:07.679
Baroque façade?
 

00:43:07.679 --> 00:43:08.579
Student:  Podium.
 

00:43:08.579 --> 00:43:09.192
Prof: What?
 

00:43:09.192 --> 00:43:09.769
A little louder.
 

00:43:09.769 --> 00:43:10.619
Student:  The podium.
 

00:43:10.619 --> 00:43:13.989
Prof: The podium,
exactly.

00:43:13.989 --> 00:43:15.739
The podium is not there.
 

00:43:15.739 --> 00:43:16.820
The podium is not there.
 

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.219
The staircase is not there.
 

00:43:19.219 --> 00:43:21.900
Why is that?
 

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:26.724
Student: I don't know if
it's because like the land is

00:43:26.724 --> 00:43:27.530
filling.
 

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:28.119
Prof: Yes.
 

00:43:28.119 --> 00:43:30.739
Student: 
&gt;

00:43:30.739 --> 00:43:32.889
Prof: Yes,
the ground level has risen,

00:43:32.889 --> 00:43:36.697
so that at the time that they
decide to turn the Temple of

00:43:36.697 --> 00:43:40.639
Antoninus Pius and Faustina into
San Lorenzo in Miranda--

00:43:40.639 --> 00:43:42.829
this is where the ground level
is.

00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:46.000
There's no podium anymore.
 

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.945
The podium is completely
underground, as are part of the

00:43:47.945 --> 00:43:50.527
columns;
we see only the part of the--so

00:43:50.527 --> 00:43:54.693
they put the door at the bottom,
what is the bottom at that

00:43:54.693 --> 00:43:56.059
particular time.
 

00:43:56.059 --> 00:43:58.199
Now let me show you the
building today.

00:43:58.199 --> 00:43:59.960
It's very well preserved.
 

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:03.074
So you see what I mean by the
best-preserved monument to--the

00:44:03.074 --> 00:44:06.083
best-preserved temple to an
emperor and an empress in Rome:

00:44:06.083 --> 00:44:07.590
extremely well preserved.
 

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:11.172
You see its location is in the
Roman Forum, with the backdrop

00:44:11.172 --> 00:44:14.336
of the Imperial Fora behind it:
the Forum of Augustus,

00:44:14.336 --> 00:44:15.769
the Forum of Trajan.
 

00:44:15.769 --> 00:44:17.039
In the Roman Forum.
 

00:44:17.039 --> 00:44:20.791
So prime real estate for this
temple, when Antoninus Pius

00:44:20.791 --> 00:44:23.070
decides to build it to his wife.
 

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:26.978
We see here the original
podium, the original staircase,

00:44:26.978 --> 00:44:29.961
the original columns:
grey granite columns,

00:44:29.961 --> 00:44:31.809
white marble capitals.
 

00:44:31.809 --> 00:44:35.159
We see the original lintel with
the inscription still preserved:

00:44:35.159 --> 00:44:38.030
To Divine Antoninus Pius,
to Divine Faustina.

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:41.360
We see the original tufa walls
of the side.

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:45.503
We see the lintel on this side
that also has a frieze that is

00:44:45.503 --> 00:44:47.369
preserved from antiquity.
 

00:44:47.369 --> 00:44:50.512
And then we see,
growing up behind it,

00:44:50.512 --> 00:44:55.780
the seventeenth-century Baroque
church, with its buttresses and

00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:59.010
with its broken arcuated
pediment.

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:01.847
And if you look very carefully,
you will see this was ground

00:45:01.847 --> 00:45:03.579
level, in the seventeenth
century.

00:45:03.579 --> 00:45:05.789
This is the seventeenth-century
door.

00:45:05.789 --> 00:45:09.090
This is the ancient door down
here.

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:11.505
I'll show you a couple of views
where you can see that even more

00:45:11.505 --> 00:45:11.889
clearly.
 

00:45:11.889 --> 00:45:15.454
Here's another view showing you
those grey granite columns,

00:45:15.454 --> 00:45:18.590
the white capitals,
the seventeenth-century door.

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:21.579
And then down here the ancient
door,

00:45:21.579 --> 00:45:23.775
which shows you more
dramatically than anything else

00:45:23.775 --> 00:45:25.670
I've been able to show you this
semester,

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:27.789
this change in ground level.
 

00:45:27.789 --> 00:45:31.126
And two more views that I took
that show you the same here,

00:45:31.126 --> 00:45:32.909
the seventeenth-century door.
 

00:45:32.909 --> 00:45:35.335
So you have to think of all of
this underground in the

00:45:35.335 --> 00:45:38.996
seventeenth century,
and then only in more modern

00:45:38.996 --> 00:45:44.409
times was the temple excavated,
temple and church excavated

00:45:44.409 --> 00:45:47.010
down to their original level.
 

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:49.086
Here's another view showing you
again the seventeenth-century

00:45:49.086 --> 00:45:50.679
doorway, the earlier doorway,
the staircase.

00:45:50.679 --> 00:45:54.025
A little baby down here,
which I was happy to have for

00:45:54.025 --> 00:45:54.530
scale.
 

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:58.679
It gives you a sense once again
of how--and that makes it even

00:45:58.679 --> 00:46:01.740
more dramatic,
because--I don't know if it's a

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.742
he or a she;
she, she, sitting there,

00:46:04.742 --> 00:46:09.603
that she--it makes it even more
dramatic to demonstrate to you

00:46:09.603 --> 00:46:11.434
again,
since this is a lecture on

00:46:11.434 --> 00:46:14.179
bigger is better,
that this Temple to Antoninus

00:46:14.179 --> 00:46:18.583
and Faustina was also very,
very--also is very,

00:46:18.583 --> 00:46:21.250
very large in scale.
 

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:26.485
When Antoninus Pius died,
in 161, he was succeeded by

00:46:26.485 --> 00:46:30.010
Marcus Aurelius and Lucius
Verus;

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:31.597
Marcus Aurelius,
one of the most famous of the

00:46:31.597 --> 00:46:33.114
Roman emperors,
the great stoic philosopher,

00:46:33.114 --> 00:46:34.489
and you see him in a portrait
here.

00:46:34.489 --> 00:46:37.389
You see Lucius Verus on the
left-hand side.

00:46:37.389 --> 00:46:42.280
The two of them were
co-emperors between 161 and 169.

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.659
Lucius Verus died in battle in
169.

00:46:45.659 --> 00:46:51.929
Marcus Aurelius continued on
alone, until the year 180 A.D.

00:46:51.929 --> 00:46:54.849
So he too had a very long reign.
 

00:46:54.849 --> 00:46:57.929
Marcus spent most of his reign,
however, on the front.

00:46:57.929 --> 00:47:01.710
During the period that he was
emperor, the barbarians were

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:03.369
literally at the gates.
 

00:47:03.369 --> 00:47:05.929
There was concern that they
were going to,

00:47:05.929 --> 00:47:08.659
in fact, overrun the city
completely,

00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:11.954
overrun the Empire completely,
and he had to spend most of his

00:47:11.954 --> 00:47:15.251
reign on the frontiers,
and he did, beating back those

00:47:15.251 --> 00:47:16.010
barbarians.
 

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:18.481
For that reason,
there was very little

00:47:18.481 --> 00:47:20.420
architectural construction.
 

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:22.809
Even though he had a very long
reign,

00:47:22.809 --> 00:47:25.038
there was very little
architectural construction

00:47:25.038 --> 00:47:26.840
during the time of Marcus
Aurelius,

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:32.309
because of the time that he had
to spend in war.

00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:35.427
He was succeeded by his son,
Commodus, whose portrait you

00:47:35.427 --> 00:47:38.190
see down here;
Commodus in the line,

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:42.820
also in the megalomaniacal line
of Nero and Domitian:

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:46.739
a man who saw himself as a god
on earth,

00:47:46.739 --> 00:47:50.190
who saw himself as the Greek
hero Hercules.

00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:53.250
He called himself Hercules
Romanus.

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:56.244
And we see him in his most
famous and most fabulous--this

00:47:56.244 --> 00:47:59.237
is about one of the best
portraits preserved from ancient

00:47:59.237 --> 00:47:59.719
Rome.
 

00:47:59.719 --> 00:48:01.349
It's in the Capitoline Museums
today,

00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:04.570
and you see him masquerading
here as Hercules,

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:08.780
with the lion's skin around his
head,

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:11.186
holding the club,
holding the apples of the

00:48:11.186 --> 00:48:13.668
Hesperides,
demonstrating that he has

00:48:13.668 --> 00:48:17.306
completed that last labor,
just as Hercules had done,

00:48:17.306 --> 00:48:21.090
and is going to become a god in
the manner of Hercules.

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:23.889
He used to parade around in
Rome openly in this way,

00:48:23.889 --> 00:48:26.621
and actually struck coins
showing himself as Hercules

00:48:26.621 --> 00:48:28.980
Romanus,
just to give you a sense of how

00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:29.900
extreme it was.
 

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:35.579
And he was always challenging
people to hand-to-hand combat.

00:48:35.579 --> 00:48:37.619
And, in fact,
he eventually got his

00:48:37.619 --> 00:48:41.280
comeuppance because although he
himself also reigned for quite

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.804
awhile,
between 180 and 192--so he

00:48:43.804 --> 00:48:47.554
lasted for twelve years--
but nonetheless even his

00:48:47.554 --> 00:48:52.173
closest advisors eventually
turned against him and plotted

00:48:52.173 --> 00:48:56.550
behind his back and arranged for
one of the most famous

00:48:56.550 --> 00:49:00.478
gladiators of the day,
Narcissus, interestingly called

00:49:00.478 --> 00:49:04.018
Narcissus,
to take up Commodus' offer to

00:49:04.018 --> 00:49:09.619
fight anybody who wanted to
fight him in the Colosseum.

00:49:09.619 --> 00:49:12.648
And, of course,
he thought that being emperor

00:49:12.648 --> 00:49:14.469
protected him,
and that he,

00:49:14.469 --> 00:49:17.400
like Nero, who fixed the
Olympic Games in his favor,

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:21.440
that Commodus would also never
lose in a contest like this,

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:25.010
because he was by definition
emperor.

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:28.304
But his advisors turned against
him, let Narcissus loose,

00:49:28.304 --> 00:49:31.539
and Commodus was slain by
Narcissus in the Colosseum.

00:49:31.539 --> 00:49:34.340
But he did--I do want to just
mention,

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:38.003
and only in passing--Commodus
did put up a column to his

00:49:38.003 --> 00:49:39.697
father,
Marcus Aurelius,

00:49:39.697 --> 00:49:43.550
that is based very closely on
the Column of Trajan in Rome.

00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:45.590
I'm not going to go into it
with you today,

00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:47.925
because the architectural
complex in which it was

00:49:47.925 --> 00:49:49.869
originally found no longer
survives.

00:49:49.869 --> 00:49:53.815
But I just wanted you to be
aware that the Column of Trajan

00:49:53.815 --> 00:49:57.150
was succeeded by the Column of
Marcus Aurelius.

00:49:57.150 --> 00:50:00.188
I want to however turn,
for the rest of the lecture,

00:50:00.188 --> 00:50:03.643
to a new dynasty that came to
the fore after the end of the

00:50:03.643 --> 00:50:05.550
so-called Antonine emperors.
 

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:09.050
When Commodus died,
there were no more Antonines to

00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:12.543
succeed him,
and Rome once again fell into a

00:50:12.543 --> 00:50:15.264
civil war,
and there were rivals warring

00:50:15.264 --> 00:50:17.469
with one another for supreme
power.

00:50:17.469 --> 00:50:21.155
And the man who came to the
fore was a man by the name of

00:50:21.155 --> 00:50:23.000
Pertinax, P-e-r-t-i-n-a-x.
 

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.735
But he had other rivals,
and one of them was the man who

00:50:26.735 --> 00:50:30.605
eventually really came out on
top, and his name was Lucius

00:50:30.605 --> 00:50:32.099
Septimius Severus.
 

00:50:32.099 --> 00:50:37.039
Lucius Septimius Severus was
within that year,

00:50:37.039 --> 00:50:38.702
between 92 and 93 ,
able to get rid of not only

00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:41.942
Pertinax but other rivals,
and become supreme ruler of

00:50:41.942 --> 00:50:42.429
Rome.
 

00:50:42.429 --> 00:50:45.690
And because he,
like Vespasian before him,

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:48.469
had two sons to succeed him,
Caracalla and Geta,

00:50:48.469 --> 00:50:50.989
he was able to set up a new
dynasty,

00:50:50.989 --> 00:50:53.360
the so-called Severan,
what we call the Severan,

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:57.500
S-e-v-e-r-a-n,
the Severan dynasty in Rome.

00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:00.059
The Severan dynasty in Rome,
extremely important,

00:51:00.059 --> 00:51:03.809
because Septimius Severus
commissioned some important

00:51:03.809 --> 00:51:06.505
structures,
both public structures and

00:51:06.505 --> 00:51:08.722
private;
he was an interesting emperor

00:51:08.722 --> 00:51:11.199
because he combined an interest
in the two.

00:51:11.199 --> 00:51:14.561
And then his son,
Caracalla, who epitomizes,

00:51:14.561 --> 00:51:18.003
as I began today,
the whole bigger is better,

00:51:18.003 --> 00:51:22.929
or biggest is best philosophy,
in life and in architecture.

00:51:22.929 --> 00:51:26.818
I want to show you first,
just to introduce you to these

00:51:26.818 --> 00:51:30.920
two patrons, this wonderful
painted tondo that is preserved

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:31.909
from Rome.
 

00:51:31.909 --> 00:51:35.824
It was found--excuse me,
not in Rome but in Egypt,

00:51:35.824 --> 00:51:38.619
and is now in a museum in
Berlin.

00:51:38.619 --> 00:51:43.809
But it is important because it
is our only surviving painting

00:51:43.809 --> 00:51:46.597
of an emperor,
and not only an emperor but an

00:51:46.597 --> 00:51:49.320
emperor and his whole family,
his wife and his children;

00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:52.590
the only surviving painting of
an emperor today.

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:55.750
But there were obviously many
of these in antiquity.

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:57.199
It's a fascinating painting.
 

00:51:57.199 --> 00:52:00.239
We see Septimius Severus with
his grey hair and beard,

00:52:00.239 --> 00:52:02.190
and his wonderful jeweled
crown.

00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:04.297
We see his wife,
Julia Domna,

00:52:04.297 --> 00:52:07.623
who--and by the way,
I neglected to mention,

00:52:07.623 --> 00:52:11.576
but one of the interesting
things about Septimius Severus'

00:52:11.576 --> 00:52:15.389
biography is the fact that he
was born not in Rome,

00:52:15.389 --> 00:52:17.880
and not in Spain,
as Trajan and Hadrian had been,

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:22.170
but rather in North Africa,
in a place called Leptis Magna,

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:24.730
L-e-p-t-i-s,
new word, M-a-g-n-a,

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:30.010
in Leptis Magna,
born in North Africa.

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:33.525
He hooked up with a woman from
Syria, whose name was Julia

00:52:33.525 --> 00:52:34.018
Domna.
 

00:52:34.018 --> 00:52:36.711
She was the daughter of an
important priest in Syria called

00:52:36.711 --> 00:52:37.268
Bassianus.
 

00:52:37.268 --> 00:52:41.268
She was famous in Rome for her
wigs;

00:52:41.268 --> 00:52:44.786
she used to wear wigs,
and you can see her wearing one

00:52:44.786 --> 00:52:48.039
of her wigs in this wonderful
painted portrait.

00:52:48.039 --> 00:52:51.411
She also clearly liked jewelry,
because you can see her with

00:52:51.411 --> 00:52:54.668
these fabulous triple pearl
earrings and a wonderful pearl

00:52:54.668 --> 00:52:57.940
necklace here also,
looking very vibrant in this

00:52:57.940 --> 00:52:58.619
portrait.
 

00:52:58.619 --> 00:53:00.639
And then the two of them with
their sons;

00:53:00.639 --> 00:53:02.865
their elder son,
Caracalla over her,

00:53:02.865 --> 00:53:05.730
and their younger son,
or what remains of him,

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:07.130
Geta, on the left.
 

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:13.114
Geta and Caracalla succeeded
their father together,

00:53:13.114 --> 00:53:14.909
as co-rulers.
 

00:53:14.909 --> 00:53:17.454
But Caracalla,
very jealous of his brother,

00:53:17.454 --> 00:53:20.664
who was much more popular with
the Roman populace than

00:53:20.664 --> 00:53:22.239
Caracalla himself was.
 

00:53:22.239 --> 00:53:25.650
And Caracalla eventually had
his brother murdered,

00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:27.389
and after his brother was
murdered,

00:53:27.389 --> 00:53:30.907
he convinced--that is,
Caracalla--convinced the Roman

00:53:30.907 --> 00:53:34.018
Senate to issue a damnatio
memoriae,

00:53:34.018 --> 00:53:37.210
or a damnation of the memory of
Geta,

00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:40.130
and an attempt was made to
eradicate Geta from history by

00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:41.539
eradicating him from art.
 

00:53:41.539 --> 00:53:43.389
And you can see that he was
snuffed out;

00:53:43.389 --> 00:53:48.070
his face was removed on this.
 

00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:50.311
But then it was left to stand,
to show the power that

00:53:50.311 --> 00:53:52.900
Caracalla had to destroy his
brother, as you can see here.

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:56.719
This gives you a glimpse into
the mind and psyche of

00:53:56.719 --> 00:53:57.619
Caracalla.
 

00:53:57.619 --> 00:54:00.480
I want to show you first though
two buildings;

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.639
before we look at the Baths of
Caracalla,

00:54:02.639 --> 00:54:07.025
I do want to show you two
buildings of Septimius Severus:

00:54:07.025 --> 00:54:10.554
a public building first,
the so-called Arch of Septimius

00:54:10.554 --> 00:54:13.871
Severus in the Roman Forum,
and then an extension to the

00:54:13.871 --> 00:54:15.079
Palatine Palace.
 

00:54:15.079 --> 00:54:20.592
The Arch of Septimius Severus
in the Roman Forum dates to A.D.

00:54:20.592 --> 00:54:25.744
203, and it commemorates the
Parthian victory of Septimius

00:54:25.744 --> 00:54:26.829
Severus.
 

00:54:26.829 --> 00:54:29.215
Septimius Severus,
I already mentioned to you,

00:54:29.215 --> 00:54:30.860
came to power in a civil war.
 

00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:36.039
So like Augustus,
and like Vespasian before him,

00:54:36.039 --> 00:54:39.141
he needed to gain legitimacy by
having an important foreign

00:54:39.141 --> 00:54:41.253
victory,
and he does this by looking

00:54:41.253 --> 00:54:43.510
East, as Augustus had done
before him,

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:48.210
looking to Parthia,
and does war with Parthia,

00:54:48.210 --> 00:54:49.679
and in fact has an important
victory,

00:54:49.679 --> 00:54:53.717
and celebrates that important
victory in this triumphal arch

00:54:53.717 --> 00:54:56.659
that is put up in his honor in
203 A.D.,

00:54:56.659 --> 00:54:59.840
in once again the choicest spot
of real estate in Rome,

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.880
the Forum Romanum,
the Roman Forum.

00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:05.579
I show you a Google Earth view
over here.

00:55:05.579 --> 00:55:08.527
We've seen this one before,
so you've undoubtedly got this

00:55:08.527 --> 00:55:11.608
one memorized by now,
this Google Earth image of the

00:55:11.608 --> 00:55:15.262
Roman Forum as it looks today,
with the Colosseum up there,

00:55:15.262 --> 00:55:17.320
with the Via dei Fori
Imperiali,

00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:19.768
Imperial Fora,
over here, the Circus Maximus,

00:55:19.768 --> 00:55:23.159
the Palatine Hill,
the Campidoglio,

00:55:23.159 --> 00:55:25.760
Capitoline Hill as redesigned
by Michelangelo,

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:29.750
the wedding cake of Victor
Emmanuel here,

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:34.030
between the Campidoglio and the
Colosseum.

00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:36.568
We see, of course,
the remains of the ancient

00:55:36.568 --> 00:55:40.032
Roman Forum -- much lower ground
level than the modern ground

00:55:40.032 --> 00:55:40.610
level.
 

00:55:40.610 --> 00:55:44.914
You'll recall the location of
the Temple of Venus and Roma,

00:55:44.914 --> 00:55:47.289
just underneath the Colosseum.
 

00:55:47.289 --> 00:55:49.630
The Arch of Titus on the Velia.
 

00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:52.260
And you should remember also
that we talked,

00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:54.610
way in the beginning of the
term, about two arches,

00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:58.001
two successive arches,
built in honor of Augustus:

00:55:58.001 --> 00:56:00.918
first his Actian victory,
victory in Actium,

00:56:00.918 --> 00:56:03.199
and then his victory over the
Parthians,

00:56:03.199 --> 00:56:04.539
which is over here.
 

00:56:04.539 --> 00:56:06.978
And then if we look very
close--it's a little hard to see

00:56:06.978 --> 00:56:09.273
when I'm up this close--
but we look very closely,

00:56:09.273 --> 00:56:12.311
we will see the location--
I think it's roughly around

00:56:12.311 --> 00:56:14.949
here--of the Arch of Septimius
Severus.

00:56:14.949 --> 00:56:19.000
We can see it better in this
plan of the Roman Forum as it

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.980
developed between the third and
seventh centuries A.D.

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:27.130
We see the Tabularium at the
top, which means we're close to

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:28.679
the Capitoline Hill.
 

00:56:28.679 --> 00:56:31.710
We see two basilicas that were
put up in the Republican period.

00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:36.032
We see a temple that we did not
study, that was put up in honor

00:56:36.032 --> 00:56:39.030
of the divine Julius Caesar,
by Augustus.

00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:43.070
We see the Speaker's Platform.
 

00:56:43.070 --> 00:56:45.297
We see the Senate House,
which I will show you in a

00:56:45.297 --> 00:56:46.010
later lecture.
 

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:47.773
And over here we see the
location of what was originally

00:56:47.773 --> 00:56:49.601
the Actian Arch of Augustus,
and then the Parthian Arch of

00:56:49.601 --> 00:56:50.018
Augustus.
 

00:56:50.018 --> 00:56:55.347
And remember that the Parthian
Arch of Augustus had a triple

00:56:55.347 --> 00:56:56.250
opening.
 

00:56:56.250 --> 00:57:01.010
And then if you look at the
rest of the plan,

00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:02.900
you will see the location of
the Arch of Septimius Severus,

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:06.768
over there, diagonally across,
in dialogue,

00:57:06.768 --> 00:57:10.639
with the Parthian Arch of
Augustus.

00:57:10.639 --> 00:57:11.550
Was this coincidence?
 

00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:12.829
Absolutely not.
 

00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:17.405
This was clearly very carefully
orchestrated by Septimius

00:57:17.405 --> 00:57:21.737
Severus and his advisors to
build his Parthian Arch in

00:57:21.737 --> 00:57:25.659
dialogue with the Parthian Arch
of Augustus.

00:57:25.659 --> 00:57:28.724
With regard to its form,
it also made reference to the

00:57:28.724 --> 00:57:29.650
Augustan arch.
 

00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:32.974
I show you here the Arch of
Septimius Severus as it looks

00:57:32.974 --> 00:57:33.449
today.
 

00:57:33.449 --> 00:57:38.074
It is our first example that
we've seen this semester of a

00:57:38.074 --> 00:57:41.400
Roman arch with a triple
arcuated opening:

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:44.969
a large arcuated opening in the
center,

00:57:44.969 --> 00:57:49.119
flanked by two smaller,
lower arcuated entrances.

00:57:49.119 --> 00:57:52.280
We have not seen that before --
first surviving example in Rome.

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:55.213
We remember,
if we think back to the arches

00:57:55.213 --> 00:57:58.427
we have explored,
from the time of Augustus on,

00:57:58.427 --> 00:58:02.199
you'll remember that they are
single-bayed arches.

00:58:02.199 --> 00:58:04.831
Augustus' Actian arch,
the Arch of Titus,

00:58:04.831 --> 00:58:08.650
and even the second-century
Arch of Trajan at Benevento.

00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:15.103
But, as I've already said
today, if we look back to the

00:58:15.103 --> 00:58:17.143
coin--
the arch no longer exists--but

00:58:17.143 --> 00:58:19.130
we look back to a coin depiction
of the Parthian Arch of

00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:21.090
Augustus,
it had three openings:

00:58:21.090 --> 00:58:25.360
a central arcuated opening and
then two rectangular openings,

00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:28.905
trabeated openings,
with pediments on either side,

00:58:28.905 --> 00:58:29.920
flanking it.
 

00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:34.052
So this is not--the Parthian
arch of Augustus is not a triple

00:58:34.052 --> 00:58:37.360
arcuated arch,
but it is a three opening arch.

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:39.541
And I think there is no
question that those three

00:58:39.541 --> 00:58:41.949
openings are being alluded to in
the Severan arch,

00:58:41.949 --> 00:58:45.860
and being transformed into
something that was new,

00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:49.018
which was the idea of the
triple-arcuated bay.

00:58:49.018 --> 00:58:51.340
Or maybe it wasn't so new,
because there's an arch--

00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:54.929
the arch that you see down
here--in the south of France,

00:58:54.929 --> 00:58:58.358
at Orange -- and we'll look at
this arch when we make our

00:58:58.358 --> 00:59:02.106
journey to the south of France;
in an upcoming lecture we will

00:59:02.106 --> 00:59:03.199
look at this arch.
 

00:59:03.199 --> 00:59:06.661
And it's a triple-bayed arch,
just like the Arch of Septimius

00:59:06.661 --> 00:59:07.239
Severus.
 

00:59:07.239 --> 00:59:09.634
It's covered with sculpture,
just like the Arch of Septimius

00:59:09.634 --> 00:59:10.039
Severus.
 

00:59:10.039 --> 00:59:13.443
So for a while there were
scholars who dated this to the

00:59:13.443 --> 00:59:16.413
time of Septimius Severus,
although put up in the

00:59:16.413 --> 00:59:17.280
provinces.
 

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:20.480
But recent scholarship,
more recent scholarship,

00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:24.465
has demonstrated--scholars have
looked at the piles of arms and

00:59:24.465 --> 00:59:27.168
armor on here,
and identified it as piles of

00:59:27.168 --> 00:59:30.498
arms and armor that had to do
with battles that took place in

00:59:30.498 --> 00:59:33.164
the south of France,
or what is now the south of

00:59:33.164 --> 00:59:36.010
France,
in the age of Augustus.

00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:38.235
There's also an inscription
referring to a specific

00:59:38.235 --> 00:59:40.329
historical figure who lived
during the time,

00:59:40.329 --> 00:59:43.099
the late period of Augustus,
and into the time of Tiberius.

00:59:43.099 --> 00:59:46.826
So it seems very likely that
this is not a Severan arch but a

00:59:46.826 --> 00:59:47.820
Tiberian arch.
 

00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:53.010
And I show it to you here only
because while we usually--

00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:55.289
and this may be helpful to some
of you who are doing paper

00:59:55.289 --> 00:59:56.929
topics or city plans in the
provinces--

00:59:56.929 --> 01:00:00.697
we usually think of ideas
flowing from the center to the

01:00:00.697 --> 01:00:01.518
periphery.
 

01:00:01.518 --> 01:00:05.286
But here we seem to have an
idea that comes to the fore

01:00:05.286 --> 01:00:08.983
first in the periphery,
and then ends up ultimately in

01:00:08.983 --> 01:00:11.077
the center;
although, of course,

01:00:11.077 --> 01:00:14.010
there are lots of missing
pieces to the ancient puzzle.

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:16.030
There are lots of monuments
that have not come down to us.

01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:18.494
So it is not inconceivable that
a triple-bayed arch was built in

01:00:18.494 --> 01:00:20.099
Rome earlier,
but we just have no evidence

01:00:20.099 --> 01:00:20.530
for it.
 

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:22.869
I want to show you the arch
itself very quickly,

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:24.960
because it's mainly a work of
sculpture.

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.400
But just to show you the three
bays.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.699
Victories in the spandles;
river gods down here;

01:00:30.699 --> 01:00:32.099
inscription at the top.
 

01:00:32.099 --> 01:00:35.047
You'll have to imagine the
great bronze quadriga of the

01:00:35.047 --> 01:00:36.250
emperor at the apex.
 

01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:38.768
Decorated bases down here.
 

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:41.947
But most interesting are the
panels that we see,

01:00:41.947 --> 01:00:45.869
four panels that we see,
two on either side of the arch.

01:00:45.869 --> 01:00:48.052
And I show you a detail,
a very good detail,

01:00:48.052 --> 01:00:50.199
of one of them here;
although it's weathered,

01:00:50.199 --> 01:00:51.360
you can see it quite well.
 

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.237
You can see that this panel,
instead of having full-length

01:00:54.237 --> 01:00:56.460
figures standing on a single
ground line,

01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:00.719
as we saw, for example,
in the frieze of the Ara Pacis,

01:01:00.719 --> 01:01:04.039
we see figures on a number of
tiers here,

01:01:04.039 --> 01:01:05.869
small figures on a number of
tiers.

01:01:05.869 --> 01:01:11.010
It should remind you of the
scenes on the Column of Trajan,

01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:12.380
those spiral,
the spiral frieze,

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.860
with the individual figures
telling the story of war,

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:19.730
and in this case the Parthian
War of Septimius Severus.

01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:22.268
And so what I think happened
here--

01:01:22.268 --> 01:01:25.250
my theory, and there are others
who've said the same--

01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:28.603
is that what happened here is
that the designer of this got

01:01:28.603 --> 01:01:31.884
the idea to take excerpts,
in a sense, from the Columns of

01:01:31.884 --> 01:01:33.632
Trajan,
or the Column of Marcus

01:01:33.632 --> 01:01:35.920
Aurelius, and put them in panel
format,

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.570
on this monument.
 

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:41.454
I don't know whether--you can
think to yourselves whether you

01:01:41.454 --> 01:01:43.090
think this is successful or not.
 

01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:45.777
I think it probably was not
deemed to be particularly

01:01:45.777 --> 01:01:48.929
successful, because it is the
only arch design of its type.

01:01:48.929 --> 01:01:54.369
No one picked up afterwards and
imitated this particular idea.

01:01:54.369 --> 01:01:56.768
The bases down below
representing Romans,

01:01:56.768 --> 01:01:58.869
bringing back Parthian
prisoners.

01:01:58.869 --> 01:02:03.556
I want to speak very briefly
also about Septimius Severus'

01:02:03.556 --> 01:02:08.159
extension of the Imperial Palace
on the Palatine Hill.

01:02:08.159 --> 01:02:09.659
He extended it to the south.
 

01:02:09.659 --> 01:02:11.947
He lived there,
just like every emperor since

01:02:11.947 --> 01:02:12.518
Domitian.
 

01:02:12.518 --> 01:02:14.260
He extended it on the southern
side--

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:18.532
that's the side nearest the
forum--and he added a

01:02:18.532 --> 01:02:22.577
façade to it,
a very elaborate façade

01:02:22.577 --> 01:02:24.110
that does not survive.
 

01:02:24.110 --> 01:02:28.280
It doesn't survive because we
know it was torn down in 1588 to

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:32.043
1589 by one of the popes,
because the pope wanted to use

01:02:32.043 --> 01:02:35.467
it in his own papal building;
wanted to use the building

01:02:35.467 --> 01:02:37.130
materials in his own papal
building.

01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:40.889
But fortunately the artist,
Marten van Heemskerck,

01:02:40.889 --> 01:02:42.949
the Renaissance artist--and
I've put his name on the

01:02:42.949 --> 01:02:46.594
Monument List for you--
Marten van Heemskerck drew some

01:02:46.594 --> 01:02:49.739
of it while it was being
dismantled.

01:02:49.739 --> 01:02:53.280
And you see a piece of it over
here in the Marten Van

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.710
Heemskerck drawing.
 

01:02:54.710 --> 01:03:00.451
There's also the plan of the
structure, also preserved on the

01:03:00.451 --> 01:03:06.192
Forma Urbis, and we can see that
marble plan of Rome from the

01:03:06.192 --> 01:03:08.010
Severan period.
 

01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:09.994
If we take both of those--that
evidence together,

01:03:09.994 --> 01:03:11.730
we can reconstruct it quite
effectively.

01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:14.759
We can see that it was a
façade that looked very

01:03:14.759 --> 01:03:18.365
much like a theater,
with wings on either side,

01:03:18.365 --> 01:03:21.501
with apses here,
three large apses,

01:03:21.501 --> 01:03:25.916
and columns inside those apses,
with other elements that have

01:03:25.916 --> 01:03:28.521
columns in three tiers:
looking very much like a

01:03:28.521 --> 01:03:30.880
theater stage set,
all done in marble.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.440
It might have been also a
fountain.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.768
There might have been a basin
down here with a water display.

01:03:36.768 --> 01:03:40.135
All of this serving as a new
façade for Domitian's

01:03:40.135 --> 01:03:41.940
Palace on the Palatine Hill.
 

01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:44.947
It's important because it's
another example of this use of

01:03:44.947 --> 01:03:46.885
progression,
recession, progression,

01:03:46.885 --> 01:03:48.780
recession, across the
façade,

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:51.320
to give an in-and-out,
undulating movement,

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.719
using the traditional
vocabulary of architecture in a

01:03:54.719 --> 01:03:58.643
way that is striking and in a
way that again heralds this new

01:03:58.643 --> 01:04:01.260
baroque style in Roman
architecture.

01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:03.668
I also mention,
just as the last point about

01:04:03.668 --> 01:04:06.541
this monument,
that we also--the reason it's

01:04:06.541 --> 01:04:09.460
called the Septizodium or the
Septizonium--

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:11.518
and you see that name on the
Monument List for you--

01:04:11.518 --> 01:04:14.958
the reason it's referred to as
the Septizodium is because it

01:04:14.958 --> 01:04:18.289
was thought to honor the--
or to commemorate the seven

01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:21.320
planets,
which is not surprising in the

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:25.000
orbits of Septimius Severus and
Julia Domna,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.027
because we know that Julia
Domna was an avid follower of

01:04:27.027 --> 01:04:29.436
astrological signs,
used to predict what was going

01:04:29.436 --> 01:04:31.300
to happen in her husband's
reign,

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:35.391
through those signs,
and this is likely a nod to her

01:04:35.391 --> 01:04:38.280
particular astrological
interests.

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:42.289
In the nine or ten minutes that
remain,

01:04:42.289 --> 01:04:47.414
I want to end today with this
extraordinary imperial bath

01:04:47.414 --> 01:04:52.447
structure that was designed at
the behest of the emperor

01:04:52.447 --> 01:04:53.730
Caracalla.
 

01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:57.849
When Septimius Severus died in
211, he was succeeded by

01:04:57.849 --> 01:04:59.679
Caracalla and by Geta.
 

01:04:59.679 --> 01:05:03.206
I've already told you what
Caracalla did to get rid of

01:05:03.206 --> 01:05:06.931
Geta,
and Caracalla became sole

01:05:06.931 --> 01:05:13.315
emperor in 212 A.D.,
and remained emperor until his

01:05:13.315 --> 01:05:15.460
death in 217 A.D.
 

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:18.793
And one of his major
commissions was this imperial

01:05:18.793 --> 01:05:19.949
bath structure.
 

01:05:19.949 --> 01:05:23.523
He wanted to ape his father,
because we know that Septimius

01:05:23.523 --> 01:05:26.603
Severus had also built a major
public bath in Rome,

01:05:26.603 --> 01:05:28.329
the Thermae Septimianae.
 

01:05:28.329 --> 01:05:31.010
They do not survive.
 

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:33.139
We have very little knowledge
of them, so there isn't anything

01:05:33.139 --> 01:05:34.710
that I can show you or tell you
about them.

01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:35.900
But we know he built it.
 

01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:39.000
So like father like son.
 

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.719
He wanted to outdo his
father--this is like Bush One,

01:05:41.719 --> 01:05:44.702
Bush Two--wanted to outdo his
father, and to build an even

01:05:44.702 --> 01:05:46.429
larger bathing establishment.
 

01:05:46.429 --> 01:05:49.226
And he does it here,
in Rome, a bathing

01:05:49.226 --> 01:05:52.393
establishment called the Baths
of Caracalla,

01:05:52.393 --> 01:05:54.750
or the Thermae Antoninianae.
 

01:05:54.750 --> 01:06:00.420
Baths of Caracalla:
dates to 212 to 216 A.D.

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:03.679
Any of you who have seen it
will agree with me this is one--

01:06:03.679 --> 01:06:07.179
if we had, if Trajan's Forum
was the mother of all forums,

01:06:07.179 --> 01:06:10.480
this is certainly the mother of
all imperial bath structures.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:12.170
This is quite something.
 

01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:14.304
Fortunately,
much of it survives,

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:18.039
mainly the concrete shell,
a concrete shell of itself.

01:06:18.039 --> 01:06:22.139
But we can see the outlines
here in this Google Earth image,

01:06:22.139 --> 01:06:24.590
which shows you not only the
bathing block,

01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:27.880
but also part of the precinct
that surrounded it.

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:30.916
Because we shall see,
if we look at a plan of the

01:06:30.916 --> 01:06:33.405
Baths of Caracalla--
which you see here in the

01:06:33.405 --> 01:06:36.144
bottom left--
this is a detail of just the

01:06:36.144 --> 01:06:39.360
bathing block,
and if we compare the general

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.949
plan with the plan of the Baths
of Trajan in Rome,

01:06:42.949 --> 01:06:44.750
we will see that the Baths of
Trajan,

01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:46.760
which were very large in their
own day,

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:51.179
have been exceeded here in
terms of size,

01:06:51.179 --> 01:06:55.210
but are very much in the same
general format.

01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:59.552
By that I mean a large bathing
block here, inside a larger

01:06:59.552 --> 01:07:00.389
precinct.
 

01:07:00.389 --> 01:07:04.085
That precinct has around it a
host of rooms that were used as

01:07:04.085 --> 01:07:08.030
lecture halls and seminar rooms
and Greek and Latin libraries.

01:07:08.030 --> 01:07:10.547
So a great locus of
intellectual,

01:07:10.547 --> 01:07:13.697
as well as wellness,
in the city of Rome,

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:15.980
in the third century A.D.
 

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:19.119
We see that in the Baths of
Caracalla,

01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:21.389
just as--if we look at the
bathing block--

01:07:21.389 --> 01:07:24.849
just as in the Baths of Trajan,
we see that all the main

01:07:24.849 --> 01:07:27.186
bathing rooms,
which were used both for men

01:07:27.186 --> 01:07:29.039
and women,
but probably at different times

01:07:29.039 --> 01:07:32.079
of day,
are aligned with one another.

01:07:32.079 --> 01:07:34.340
We see the great
frigidarium here,

01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:37.733
with a triple groin vault over
that, buttressed by rooms with

01:07:37.733 --> 01:07:39.599
barrel vaults on either side.
 

01:07:39.599 --> 01:07:42.402
We see a conventional,
vertically oriented

01:07:42.402 --> 01:07:45.391
tepidarium;
essentially a rectangle here,

01:07:45.391 --> 01:07:47.349
leading into the
caldarium.

01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:48.947
So all of these on axis:
frigidarium,

01:07:48.947 --> 01:07:50.360
tepidarium,
caldarium.

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:54.831
Caldarium,
a roundish structure,

01:07:54.831 --> 01:08:00.010
with alcoves and--but very
large in scale.

01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:03.422
In fact, you'll be interested
to hear that the span of the

01:08:03.422 --> 01:08:06.836
dome of the caldarium of
the Baths of Caracalla was

01:08:06.836 --> 01:08:10.251
almost as large as the span of
the dome of the Pantheon in

01:08:10.251 --> 01:08:12.925
Rome;
just to give you a sense of the

01:08:12.925 --> 01:08:16.960
extraordinary bigger is better
scale in this particular bath.

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:20.090
Over here a natatio,
located where it usually isn't,

01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:22.876
but here on axis with the other
rooms: an interesting

01:08:22.876 --> 01:08:25.020
natatio with a scalloped
side,

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:26.430
screened by columns.
 

01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:29.636
And then otherwise all the
rooms symmetrically disposed

01:08:29.636 --> 01:08:30.350
around it.
 

01:08:30.350 --> 01:08:33.917
The two palaestrae,
one on either side -- matching

01:08:33.917 --> 01:08:37.421
rooms symmetrically disposed
around the central building

01:08:37.421 --> 01:08:38.060
block.
 

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:40.492
So the same imperial bath
structure type,

01:08:40.492 --> 01:08:43.167
that we saw developed under
Titus and Trajan,

01:08:43.167 --> 01:08:45.600
but taken to much larger scale
here.

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:49.630
This model shows you the hall
here.

01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:53.395
We are looking back at the
walls, which were very plain on

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:55.905
three sides, toward the
natatio,

01:08:55.905 --> 01:08:59.210
toward the vaulting of the
frigidarium.

01:08:59.210 --> 01:09:01.340
And then the dome,
as you can see there,

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:02.760
of the caldarium.
 

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:06.970
Interesting is the front side
of the--

01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:10.537
or the side where you can see
the caldarium projecting

01:09:10.537 --> 01:09:13.533
over here,
which you can see is opened up

01:09:13.533 --> 01:09:18.132
much more than the other sides,
with a series of columns,

01:09:18.132 --> 01:09:21.823
screened columns,
and then columns screening and

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:24.698
opening up the caldarium
as well,

01:09:24.698 --> 01:09:27.988
on the southern side of the
monument.

01:09:27.988 --> 01:09:30.307
Just a few views,
to give you a sense of what

01:09:30.307 --> 01:09:32.100
this structure looks like today.
 

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:36.038
Again, it's mainly piles of
concrete faced with brick.

01:09:36.038 --> 01:09:39.550
But you can see some of the
soaring vaults still there.

01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:43.675
This is in fact--even in this
view it's much smaller than it

01:09:43.675 --> 01:09:46.822
would've been,
because so much of the ceilings

01:09:46.822 --> 01:09:49.408
and the vaults are missing
today.

01:09:49.408 --> 01:09:53.034
But you can get a sense by
looking at this family of four,

01:09:53.034 --> 01:09:56.279
standing next to it,
the colossal scale of the Baths

01:09:56.279 --> 01:09:57.868
of Caracalla in Rome.
 

01:09:57.868 --> 01:10:00.288
Here's another view,
with some tourists as well,

01:10:00.288 --> 01:10:01.680
to also give you a sense.
 

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:05.161
Again, this is very incomplete
today, but it still gives you

01:10:05.161 --> 01:10:08.287
some idea of the colossal
magnitude of this particular

01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:09.408
bath structure.
 

01:10:09.408 --> 01:10:12.037
As one walks through it,
there's actually very little

01:10:12.037 --> 01:10:14.970
ornamental decoration still
preserved, but there was plenty

01:10:14.970 --> 01:10:15.828
in antiquity.
 

01:10:15.828 --> 01:10:19.359
You can see here and there some
fragments of a frieze.

01:10:19.359 --> 01:10:22.533
This is a restored view of what
the frigidarium would

01:10:22.533 --> 01:10:25.393
have looked like,
the most important room in the

01:10:25.393 --> 01:10:27.246
bath,
which would have been

01:10:27.246 --> 01:10:30.003
triple-groin vaulted,
as you can see here,

01:10:30.003 --> 01:10:33.024
which would have had grey
granite columns with white

01:10:33.024 --> 01:10:35.998
marble capitals,
and would have had an

01:10:35.998 --> 01:10:38.640
incredible sculptural display.
 

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:43.010
And Caracalla,
like Domitian before him--

01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:45.865
remember Domitian's Aula Regia
and those colossal statues of

01:10:45.865 --> 01:10:48.560
Dionysus and Apollo,
with whom Domitian wanted to

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:51.630
associate himself--
Caracalla, of the same ilk,

01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:56.229
who also wanted to ally himself
with great heroes of the past,

01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:59.747
great gods of the past,
and he follows the lead of

01:10:59.747 --> 01:11:03.341
Commodus,
in whose model he kind of--he

01:11:03.341 --> 01:11:08.300
looked back again to Nero,
Domitian, to Commodus--and he

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:10.618
likened himself to Hercules.
 

01:11:10.618 --> 01:11:13.367
And we have sculpture,
that is preserved from the

01:11:13.367 --> 01:11:16.000
frigidarium that
represents Hercules;

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.109
Hercules, the weary,
the famous weary Hercules type.

01:11:19.109 --> 01:11:21.350
This is now in Naples,
in the Archaeological Museum,

01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:23.190
this statue,
but it comes from the

01:11:23.190 --> 01:11:25.868
frigidarium of the Baths
of Caracalla--

01:11:25.868 --> 01:11:28.685
we're absolutely sure of
that--and it depicts the weary

01:11:28.685 --> 01:11:29.260
Hercules.
 

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:31.489
It is a Roman copy.
 

01:11:31.489 --> 01:11:34.158
The artist, we know his name.
 

01:11:34.158 --> 01:11:36.699
I've put his name on the
Monument List for you,

01:11:36.699 --> 01:11:37.750
Glykon of Athens.
 

01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:40.699
So an Athenian sculptor,
working in the time of

01:11:40.699 --> 01:11:42.560
Caracalla, makes this copy.
 

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:45.952
But he makes it of a very
famous lost Greek original by

01:11:45.952 --> 01:11:48.771
the Greek sculptor Lysippus,
whose name is also on your

01:11:48.771 --> 01:11:51.456
Monument List,
a work of art that he

01:11:51.456 --> 01:11:54.828
originally made in the 330s B.C.
 

01:11:54.828 --> 01:11:59.081
So Glycon of Athens copies
Lysippus, also of Greece,

01:11:59.081 --> 01:12:03.000
this statue at the behest again
of Caracalla.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.985
And the fact that this was a
theme or a leitmotif that ran

01:12:05.985 --> 01:12:08.815
through all the decoration of
the frigidarium is

01:12:08.815 --> 01:12:12.380
underscored by the fact that a
composite capital that survives,

01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:14.699
also from the
frigidarium,

01:12:14.699 --> 01:12:18.979
shows a figure of that same
weary Hercules interspersed with

01:12:18.979 --> 01:12:21.880
the acanthus leaves of that
capital.

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:25.921
So again a very carefully
orchestrated program to try to

01:12:25.921 --> 01:12:30.479
underscore the relationships
between Caracalla and Hercules.

01:12:30.479 --> 01:12:36.520
Mosaics, geometric mosaics,
not unlike those in Ostia,

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:41.407
found, and still exist,
in the Baths of Caracalla today

01:12:41.407 --> 01:12:43.171
--
black and white with a little

01:12:43.171 --> 01:12:44.090
addition of color.
 

01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:48.537
Here another section that shows
you the interest in geometry,

01:12:48.537 --> 01:12:50.538
as well as floral motifs.
 

01:12:50.538 --> 01:12:53.105
This detail,
that you can also see on the

01:12:53.105 --> 01:12:55.824
site still today,
showing the sea scenes that

01:12:55.824 --> 01:12:58.533
were not--
were the kind of scenes one

01:12:58.533 --> 01:13:02.323
would expect in a bath,
very similar to those at Ostia

01:13:02.323 --> 01:13:05.538
but done in a somewhat more--
a better way.

01:13:05.538 --> 01:13:07.590
And then the pièce de
résistance,

01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:11.130
I think, of the mosaics of the
Baths of Caracalla,

01:13:11.130 --> 01:13:15.006
and well preserved today,
was a mosaic that you can see

01:13:15.006 --> 01:13:17.859
is curved,
to be placed into a room of

01:13:17.859 --> 01:13:21.985
this shape that depict on the
floor all the famous athletes

01:13:21.985 --> 01:13:27.402
and gladiators of the day,
either in full-length images or

01:13:27.402 --> 01:13:29.520
in portrait images.
 

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:32.337
And I don't doubt that these
would have been recognizable

01:13:32.337 --> 01:13:35.350
stars,
superstars--the Alex Rodriguez

01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:39.319
of their day--
superstars, flexing their

01:13:39.319 --> 01:13:43.587
muscles for the public,
and hoping to be recognized by

01:13:43.587 --> 01:13:45.270
everyone who came to this bath.
 

01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:48.246
And you can just imagine men
and women standing above,

01:13:48.246 --> 01:13:51.279
looking and trying to pick out
who is depicted here.

01:13:51.279 --> 01:13:55.082
Here's another view that I took
that is in its current location,

01:13:55.082 --> 01:13:57.618
which is in the Vatican Museums
in Rome.

01:13:57.618 --> 01:14:00.725
That's where one needs to go to
see what survives of this

01:14:00.725 --> 01:14:03.775
wonderful mosaic with the
athletes and gladiators of the

01:14:03.775 --> 01:14:04.220
day.
 

01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:06.210
And I show them to you here as
well.

01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:08.891
And if you look at these,
you can see that they not only

01:14:08.891 --> 01:14:11.769
are shown--some are already
victors, some are taking part in

01:14:11.769 --> 01:14:12.550
their sport.
 

01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:14.658
But once again,
just as in the Alexander

01:14:14.658 --> 01:14:18.119
Mosaic, we see the use of a lot
of different colored tesserae.

01:14:18.119 --> 01:14:19.698
We see cast shadows.
 

01:14:19.698 --> 01:14:22.912
This is very well done:
wonderful facial configurations

01:14:22.912 --> 01:14:26.484
done by what must have been the
leading mosaicist of the day,

01:14:26.484 --> 01:14:28.328
for the Baths of Caracalla.
 

01:14:28.328 --> 01:14:32.560
And just in closing today,
I thought I would show you one

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:35.494
of those heads,
blown up to poster size,

01:14:35.494 --> 01:14:38.885
as you can see here,
but also put it next to an

01:14:38.885 --> 01:14:41.130
actual portrait of Caracalla.
 

01:14:41.130 --> 01:14:44.134
This is not a course in
sculpture, but I wanted to show

01:14:44.134 --> 01:14:47.304
this to you, especially since
it's a portrait that you can

01:14:47.304 --> 01:14:47.750
see.
 

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:50.608
It's in New York,
at the Metropolitan Museum of

01:14:50.608 --> 01:14:54.523
Art -- a very powerful portrait
of a very intense Roman emperor,

01:14:54.523 --> 01:14:56.448
as you can see on the left.
 

01:14:56.448 --> 01:14:59.434
But I think there is some
relationship between the way in

01:14:59.434 --> 01:15:01.939
which the sculptors have
depicted Caracalla,

01:15:01.939 --> 01:15:04.930
with his very cubic and
abstract face,

01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:08.015
his short military hairstyle,
and the depictions of the

01:15:08.015 --> 01:15:09.729
athletes and the gladiators.
 

01:15:09.729 --> 01:15:13.220
So I think he was not only
trying to draw a relationship

01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:15.760
between himself and Hercules
Romanus,

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:19.630
but also between himself and
some of the greatest athletes

01:15:19.630 --> 01:15:24.358
and gladiators of the day,
to underscore his strength as a

01:15:24.358 --> 01:15:25.069
leader.
 

01:15:25.069 --> 01:15:28.608
It was all for naught
ultimately, but nonetheless he

01:15:28.608 --> 01:15:33.048
achieved it, and I think it also
speaks to him as a man with that

01:15:33.048 --> 01:15:35.270
bigger is better philosophy.
 

01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.770
Thank you.

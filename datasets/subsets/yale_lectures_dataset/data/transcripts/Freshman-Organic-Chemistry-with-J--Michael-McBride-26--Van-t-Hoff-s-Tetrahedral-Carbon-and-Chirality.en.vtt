00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.649
Prof: At the end last
time we saw this intemperate

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.283
quote from Hermann Kolbe on the
young van't Hoff:

00:00:09.283 --> 00:00:13.371
"The fancy trifles in
it" (his book about the

00:00:13.371 --> 00:00:17.988
arrangement of atoms in space)
"are totally devoid of any

00:00:17.988 --> 00:00:20.260
factual reality."
 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.860
The reason he thought so,
Kolbe, was he knew there could

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.840
be no way of knowing about the
arrangement of atoms in space;

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.310
they were just too small.
 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.300
But he was wrong.
 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.710
There was plenty of factual
reality.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.384
What van't Hoff had done was to
collect information about

00:00:37.384 --> 00:00:40.520
isomerism;
in particular about optically

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.698
active compounds,
those that rotated the plane of

00:00:43.698 --> 00:00:45.950
polarized light,
or twisted it.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.122
In looking at the Wiki,
I noticed some people talk

00:00:49.122 --> 00:00:51.130
about "bending"
it.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.600
Bending would be like this.
 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.916
Right?
 

00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:56.980
That's not what happens to the
plane of light as it goes.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.190
It goes and it twists.
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.049
Right? It rotates;
it doesn't bend.

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.471
Bending is refractive index;
you know, light goes into the

00:01:05.471 --> 00:01:07.239
surface of water and then bends.
 

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:11.456
But this is twisting the
direction that the electric

00:01:11.456 --> 00:01:13.110
vector oscillates.
 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.468
Okay, so these optically active
compounds that would do that,

00:01:17.468 --> 00:01:19.718
when in solution,
were numerous,

00:01:19.718 --> 00:01:23.860
and van't Hoff was able to cite
a number of examples;

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.599
for example, lactic acid.
 

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:30.269
But you remember who discovered
lactic acid?

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:33.667
Scheele already -- close to 100
years before this,

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:36.510
Scheele had isolated it from
sour milk.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.482
But Liebig then found the same
analysis of the acid he got from

00:01:41.482 --> 00:01:44.450
meat… isolated it from
meat.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.961
And Wislicenus,
at this same time that van't

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:50.444
Hoff is working --
in fact, the guy who had one of

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:54.849
his helpers translate the work
of van't Hoff into German for

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:59.330
that publication and was
therefore castigated by Kolbe --

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.096
Wislicenus showed that these
things had the same

00:02:02.096 --> 00:02:05.459
connectivity,
by chemical transformation;

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.682
these two acids,
the one from milk and the one

00:02:09.682 --> 00:02:10.810
from meat.
 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.508
Right?
 

00:02:11.508 --> 00:02:16.179
If you look forty years later,
in the Encyclopedia Britannica

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:19.758
-- so this is a long time
afterwards, right?

00:02:19.758 --> 00:02:24.417
-- about lactic acid,
it says it's hydroxypropionic

00:02:24.417 --> 00:02:25.068
acid.
 

00:02:25.068 --> 00:02:28.583
"Two lactic acids are
known, differing from each other

00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:32.520
in the position occupied by the
hydroxyl group in the molecule;

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.875
they are known respectively as
α-hydroxypropionic

00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:36.590
acid."
 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.840
You remember what
α means?

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.580
It means on the carbon adjacent
to a carbonyl group.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.222
Okay, so there's
α-hydroxypropionic

00:02:46.222 --> 00:02:48.864
acid, which came from
fermentation and is called

00:02:48.864 --> 00:02:50.270
inactive lactic acid.
 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.449
Why would they call it inactive;
in what sense inactive?

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:58.710
Can you think what active
versus inactive would mean?

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.105
It means whether it's able to
rotate, to twist the plane of

00:03:02.105 --> 00:03:05.080
polarized light;
whether it's optically active.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.370
Okay, inactive lactic acid --
and they give the formula,

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.568
with an OH on the carbon next
to the carbonyl of the acid

00:03:11.568 --> 00:03:14.367
group --
and 3-hydroxypropionic acid,

00:03:14.367 --> 00:03:17.889
or hydracrylic acid,
which has the OH on the

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.199
terminal carbon.
 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.060
Okay?
 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.990
Now these are clearly
constitutional isomers.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.569
It's a different sequence of
bonds.

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:27.628
Okay?
 

00:03:27.628 --> 00:03:31.087
But they go on to say,
"Although on structural

00:03:31.087 --> 00:03:35.238
grounds there should be only two
hydroxypropionic acids"

00:03:35.238 --> 00:03:39.250
(these two) "as a matter
of fact four lactic acids are

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.080
known.
 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.205
The third isomer"
(in addition to the inactive

00:03:43.205 --> 00:03:46.958
one and the one that has the OH
on the last carbon) "the

00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.210
third is sarcolactic acid."
 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.590
Sarco means from flesh.
 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.710
Okay, so that's the one that
Liebig found in meat extract.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.501
In fact, Liebig was so
interested in meat extract that

00:04:00.501 --> 00:04:05.288
he patented bouillon cubes,
and they were known for a long

00:04:05.288 --> 00:04:07.300
time as Liebig's material or
whatever,

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.620
I forget exactly.
 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.254
But I once looked at a train
menu from the late 19th century,

00:04:12.254 --> 00:04:15.646
in the restaurant car of the
train, and they were serving

00:04:15.646 --> 00:04:16.920
Liebig's extract.
 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.899
Okay?
 

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:22.250
So there's the third one is
Liebig's,

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.603
the sarcolactic acid,
"and may be prepared by

00:04:25.603 --> 00:04:29.574
the action of Penicillium
glaucum on the solution of

00:04:29.574 --> 00:04:31.629
ordinary ammonium lactate.
 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:36.550
It is identical with
α-hydroxypropionic

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.947
acid in almost every respect,
except with regard to its

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.360
physical properties."
 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.509
That's sort of an interesting
statement, isn't it?

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.685
That it's identical in every
respect, except it's all

00:04:49.685 --> 00:04:50.420
different.
 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.023
Right?
 

00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:55.149
What was similar about it,
do you think?

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:58.300
In what way was it identical,
if it had all -- its boiling

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.863
point, everything was different;
melting point,

00:05:00.863 --> 00:05:02.723
crystal form,
everything was different,

00:05:02.723 --> 00:05:04.240
all the physical properties.
 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.668
But how could they possibly say
"it is identical in almost

00:05:08.668 --> 00:05:10.240
every respect"?
 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.839
Kevin?
 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:13.000
Student:  Its formula.
 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.529
Prof: What about its
formula?

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:16.209
Obviously they're isomers.
 

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:19.079
So they have the same
composition.

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:20.937
Prof: But the
constitution is the same,

00:05:20.937 --> 00:05:21.930
the sequence of bonds.
 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.129
Right?
 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:26.141
"The fourth isomer,
formed by the action of

00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:30.050
Bacillus laevolacti on
cane sugar resembles sarcolactic

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.565
acid in every respect,
except in its action on

00:05:33.565 --> 00:05:35.350
polarized light."
 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.351
So one rotated it to the right,
the other rotated it to the

00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:41.199
left, and in every other respect
they were identical.

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:48.190
So there were four -- [and of
all right, left and inactive.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.507
Okay?
 

00:05:48.507 --> 00:05:52.252
But here, forty years after,
they don't give any explanation

00:05:52.252 --> 00:05:54.029
of why that should be so.
 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:57.339
Okay, tartaric acid we've seen
a lot.

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:58.149
Right?
 

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:01.670
Scheele; Berzelius coined the
name isomer to talk about

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.399
it;
Pasteur; Wislicenus again

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:08.560
showed the constitution;
which meant nothing to Pasteur.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.841
Why would the constitution mean
nothing to Pasteur,

00:06:12.841 --> 00:06:15.839
the nature and sequence of
bonds?

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:16.629
Yeah?
 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:20.266
Student:  He believed
the positions in space mattered,

00:06:20.266 --> 00:06:22.449
rather than the sequence of
bonds.

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.319
Prof: Would Pasteur have
written,

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:28.622
at the time he did this work,
"we don't know anything

00:06:28.622 --> 00:06:31.339
about the position of
bonds"?

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:32.940
I don't think he would've
written that.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.670
You know why?
 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.879
Bonds wouldn't be invented for
another ten years.

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:42.086
There was no such thing as
bonds, when Pasteur did his work

00:06:42.086 --> 00:06:42.639
in 1848.
 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.019
Bonds came in 1858.
 

00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:46.810
Right?
 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:51.769
So Pasteur didn't have the
tools to think about this.

00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:52.023
Okay?
 

00:06:52.023 --> 00:06:55.172
So aspartic acid was an example
of something that was optically

00:06:55.172 --> 00:06:55.680
active.
 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.440
Amyl alcohol could rotate light.
 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.930
Glucose could rotate light.
 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.800
Notice that this didn't mean
they had both the one that could

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.720
rotate one way and the one that
could rotate the other way.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.230
They had something that could
rotate light.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.629
In the case of lactic acid they
had things that would rotate

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:11.379
either way.
 

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:11.776
Right?
 

00:07:11.776 --> 00:07:14.615
In the case of tartaric acid,
after Pasteur,

00:07:14.615 --> 00:07:15.740
they had that.
 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.103
Okay?
 

00:07:16.103 --> 00:07:20.612
And also laevulose and lactose
were another two that were known

00:07:20.612 --> 00:07:23.230
but were not cited by van't
Hoff.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:29.509
Malic acid -- you know what
that comes from?

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:32.110
Where's the root, mal?
 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.170
It's apples, right?
 

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.779
So it's sour apples.
 

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:39.209
Okay, and most of the
derivatives of these compounds,

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:42.362
most things you could get by
chemical transformations from

00:07:42.362 --> 00:07:44.629
these compounds were optically
active,

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:48.930
but not the stuff you got by
dehydrating malic acid.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:53.014
If you got the double bond,
so you got maleic and fumaric

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:56.444
acid, two isomers,
but they didn't -- neither of

00:07:56.444 --> 00:07:59.800
them rotated light,
neither right or left.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.120
Right?
 

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.050
So that was destroyed in this
case.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:06.259
And also there was another
example, which was replacing the

00:08:06.259 --> 00:08:07.639
OH by a hydrogen.
 

00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:12.819
So you have CH_2CH_2 in the
middle, instead of CH(OH)CH_2.

00:08:12.819 --> 00:08:17.528
And that particular experiment,
van't Hoff was involved in;

00:08:17.528 --> 00:08:21.435
he was involved in by
suggesting it to his fellow

00:08:21.435 --> 00:08:24.230
student,
Bremer, who did it by treating

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.829
it with hydriodic acid and
phosphorous,

00:08:26.829 --> 00:08:30.220
which was a way of removing OHs
and changing them to hydrogen,

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.449
in those days.
 

00:08:31.449 --> 00:08:33.600
We'll see later that that's
called reduction.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.791
But at any rate there were
these two derivatives of malic

00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:41.457
acid that were not optically
active, although most

00:08:41.457 --> 00:08:43.029
derivatives were.
 

00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:44.038
Okay?
 

00:08:44.038 --> 00:08:46.764
Now, van't Hoff,
as I said, was involved at

00:08:46.764 --> 00:08:49.360
least in suggesting these
experiments.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.269
And, as we said,
those two were inactive.

00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:56.019
In van't Hoff's obituary,
a former student of his,

00:08:56.019 --> 00:09:00.320
Bancroft, who was by this time
a professor at Cornell,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.614
wrote: "In his whole life
he never made what would be

00:09:03.614 --> 00:09:05.809
called a very accurate
measurement,

00:09:05.809 --> 00:09:07.690
and he never cared to.
 

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.450
I remember his saying to me
eighteen years ago,

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.561
'How fortunate it is there are
other people who will do that

00:09:13.561 --> 00:09:15.460
sort of work for us.'"
Right?

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.066
So it's great to do
experiments, but in some sense

00:09:18.066 --> 00:09:20.566
it's even greater if you can
talk somebody else,

00:09:20.566 --> 00:09:22.960
who's competent,
into doing them for you.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.720
Okay?
 

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.950
And that was van't Hoff's
approach.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.880
Now, what van't Hoff noticed
was that these compounds,

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.090
that were optically active,
all had something in common.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:35.700
They all had these red atoms in
common.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.250
What's special about the
carbons that are red,

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.509
that exist in the ones that are
optically active,

00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:46.769
but don't exist in the ones
that are not optically active?

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:51.669
What's special about the ones
that are in italics in red?

00:09:51.669 --> 00:09:52.950
What makes them different?
 

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.149
This is what van't Hoff noticed.
 

00:09:55.149 --> 00:09:55.918
Chris?
 

00:09:55.918 --> 00:09:57.460
Student:  Are they
chiral carbons?

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:01.250
Prof: Well they are,
but what did van't Hoff notice?

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.860
Chiral didn't exist then,
as a name.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.100
Yeah Andrew?
 

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.240
Student:  They have four
bonds &gt;.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.517
Prof: They all have --
they use their four bonds to

00:10:10.517 --> 00:10:12.070
bond to different groups.
 

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.830
No two things are the same.
 

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:18.238
Down here, this carbon that was
red here, has two hydrogens on

00:10:18.238 --> 00:10:18.600
it.
 

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.500
Here it has two bonds to
another carbon.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.850
Right?
 

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.115
But in the other cases they're
all, these red carbons are

00:10:26.115 --> 00:10:28.740
unique in bonding to four
different things.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.024
This one, for example,
this carbon is bonded to

00:10:31.024 --> 00:10:34.304
hydrogen,
to OH, to another carbon that

00:10:34.304 --> 00:10:38.282
goes out on this chain,
and another carbon that goes

00:10:38.282 --> 00:10:39.408
out on that chain.
 

00:10:39.408 --> 00:10:40.830
And those two chains are
different.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.370
This one has a carbonyl group;
that has an OH.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.740
So the difference can be quite
remote.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.340
But they're different.
 

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.860
Okay, so that's what he noticed.
 

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.678
And we now call these chiral
carbons;

00:10:52.678 --> 00:10:57.187
or stereogenic,
because they give rise to

00:10:57.187 --> 00:11:01.470
special stereo arrangement in
space.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.991
So what he said was,
"Every carbon compound

00:11:04.991 --> 00:11:09.187
which in solution can rotate the
plane of polarized light

00:11:09.187 --> 00:11:13.308
contains one or more asymmetric
carbon atoms."

00:11:13.308 --> 00:11:17.759
That's what he called these,
that had four different things.

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:19.139
And he made models of carbon.
 

00:11:22.379 --> 00:11:26.625
This particular set he folded
up, colored, pasted together,

00:11:26.625 --> 00:11:30.140
and gave to this friend,
Bremer, who had done the

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.240
experiment.
 

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:36.240
And they're in the Museum
Boerhaave in Leiden now.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.552
Now look at these things and
see if you can figure out what

00:11:38.552 --> 00:11:39.308
some of them are.
 

00:11:39.308 --> 00:11:44.389
Here are tetrahedra,
whose faces are colored.

00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:46.780
So you could make…
if you had four different

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.654
colors,
that would denote being

00:11:48.654 --> 00:11:51.080
associated with four different
things,

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.730
and each face would correspond
to a substituent.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.460
Okay?
 

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.080
This one has colored vertices.
 

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.350
So instead -- you could use a
tetrahedron either way.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.761
You could use the faces to
denote a neighbor,

00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:06.996
or you could use the points to
denote where a bond is to the

00:12:06.996 --> 00:12:07.710
neighbor.
 

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.350
And he did it both ways.
 

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:14.120
What are these here?
 

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.070
What are those models?
 

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.570
Those aren't tetrahedra.
 

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:18.960
Can you see why he might have
made those models?

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.620
Kevin, what do you say?
 

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.649
Student:  To show
pentavalence?.

00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:31.139
Prof: No.
 

00:12:31.139 --> 00:12:34.308
We talked about van't Hoff last
time, last lecture.

00:12:34.308 --> 00:12:35.700
Do you remember what he was
talking about?

00:12:42.809 --> 00:12:44.730
Lucas?
 

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.190
Prof: Ladenburg Benzene.
 

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:48.580
A triangular prism.
 

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.668
That's what these are.
 

00:12:49.668 --> 00:12:54.668
And you remember this is 1,2;
3,5; 4,6;

00:12:54.668 --> 00:12:56.970
or whatever it is,
that are this way.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.022
If you color these two it's not
superimposable on one where you

00:13:00.022 --> 00:13:01.500
color this one and this one.
 

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:02.409
Or this case.
 

00:13:02.409 --> 00:13:04.798
That was AB or AB the other way.
 

00:13:04.798 --> 00:13:06.720
Those he said were absolutely
different.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.532
So those are models he made
with regard to this argument

00:13:11.532 --> 00:13:13.019
with Ladenburg.
 

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:18.174
Okay, now here are his models
of these two things you get by

00:13:18.174 --> 00:13:22.720
removing water -- pardon me --
from tartaric acid.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.548
So what he has is tetrahedra
for the carbons.

00:13:26.548 --> 00:13:29.750
And what does he mean when he
puts their edges together,

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:30.450
like this?
 

00:13:33.788 --> 00:13:36.990
What's he using to denote a
bond?

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.399
There we go.
 

00:13:43.399 --> 00:13:46.539
What's denoting a bond?
 

00:13:46.539 --> 00:13:48.230
A shared vertex.
 

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:49.450
Right?
 

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.019
So here's a single bond, right?
 

00:13:53.019 --> 00:13:55.450
What's this?
 

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:56.288
A double bond.
 

00:13:56.288 --> 00:13:58.571
That's like what Lewis did
later -- remember when he

00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:01.344
brought cubes together to share
an edge -- or a little bit like

00:14:01.344 --> 00:14:02.149
that at least.
 

00:14:02.149 --> 00:14:04.913
But now when you do that,
when you share an edge,

00:14:04.913 --> 00:14:08.370
of the other two things on each
carbon, they're different;

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.470
this one red and not red.
 

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:11.200
Right?
 

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.553
You could put them together
this way, but you could also put

00:14:15.553 --> 00:14:17.399
them together this way.
 

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:20.769
And you can't get from one to
the other without pulling them

00:14:20.769 --> 00:14:23.340
apart and putting them back
together again.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:23.720
Right?
 

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.340
So that would explain why
they're two different isomers;

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.330
maleic acid and fumaric acid.
 

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:30.778
Right?
 

00:14:30.778 --> 00:14:35.337
That you get -- when you start
with tartaric acid and pull off

00:14:35.337 --> 00:14:36.309
the water.
 

00:14:36.309 --> 00:14:37.629
Or start with malic acid.
 

00:14:37.629 --> 00:14:38.570
I was saying tartaric.
 

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:42.041
You start with malic acid,
pull off water,

00:14:42.041 --> 00:14:44.918
and you get either this or
this.

00:14:44.918 --> 00:14:49.558
Okay, so he could explain that
with his tetrahedral models.

00:14:49.558 --> 00:14:52.330
The red denotes a red vertex,
obviously.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:53.210
Okay?
 

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:56.649
Or if you have a single bond
you could count isomers.

00:14:56.649 --> 00:15:01.277
Now what he says here is you
don't get all that many isomers

00:15:01.277 --> 00:15:06.139
because it can freely rotate
about the bond between the two.

00:15:06.139 --> 00:15:09.193
So the carbon atom is in the
center of a tetrahedron,

00:15:09.193 --> 00:15:11.720
and its substituents are on the
vertices.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.379
Right?
 

00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:15.355
So the top carbon has three
things, R1, R2,

00:15:15.355 --> 00:15:15.710
R3.
 

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.658
And what he shows here is you
can rotate that freely.

00:15:18.658 --> 00:15:21.120
You don't count all these as
separate isomers.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.019
Who would've thought you did
count them as separate isomers?

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.809
You may not remember the name.
 

00:15:29.809 --> 00:15:30.570
Where was he?
 

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:31.308
What?
 

00:15:31.308 --> 00:15:32.750
Student:  The guy from
&gt;.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.568
Prof: The guy from
Palermo.

00:15:34.568 --> 00:15:35.009
Right?
 

00:15:35.009 --> 00:15:36.004
Paternó
was his name,

00:15:36.004 --> 00:15:36.298
right?
 

00:15:36.298 --> 00:15:38.120
He tried to explain the
existence of isomers.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.658
But van't Hoff says no,
that's not true;

00:15:40.658 --> 00:15:43.620
you can freely rotate,
so you can't count that.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.370
But you could have -- if you
looked down on R1,

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:51.139
R2, R3, you could look down and
see them clockwise,

00:15:51.139 --> 00:15:53.951
from one to two to three,
or you could see them

00:15:53.951 --> 00:15:56.639
counterclockwise from one to two
to three.

00:15:56.639 --> 00:15:59.610
And you can't go back and forth
between those by rotating,

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:01.539
because they're in a certain
order.

00:16:01.539 --> 00:16:04.058
So you do get isomers.
 

00:16:04.058 --> 00:16:07.567
So he made this diagram to show
that free rotation about the

00:16:07.567 --> 00:16:10.538
central bond results in rapid
inter-conversion,

00:16:10.538 --> 00:16:13.875
and thus inseparability and
irrelevance of the isomers that

00:16:13.875 --> 00:16:15.600
Paternó
talked about.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.226
And they can be arranged
clockwise or counterclockwise,

00:16:19.226 --> 00:16:23.460
which is not affected by the
rotation about the central bond.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.960
And you can then count how many
isomers there are,

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:30.769
depending on whether R1,
R2, R3 are the same as four,

00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:33.543
five, six, or are different
from four, five,

00:16:33.543 --> 00:16:33.929
six.
 

00:16:33.929 --> 00:16:34.759
Okay?
 

00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:38.619
But maybe the most spectacular
thing he showed was that if you

00:16:38.619 --> 00:16:41.340
put three tetrahedra together
like that,

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.609
you get these forms,
which -- what's the

00:16:43.609 --> 00:16:45.529
relationship between these two?
 

00:16:45.529 --> 00:16:50.538
Can you superimpose them and
have them be exactly the same?

00:16:50.538 --> 00:16:52.080
Is there any relationship
between them?

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.908
Obviously if you just slid them
together,

00:16:57.908 --> 00:17:00.548
R1 would be on top of R1 and
two on two,

00:17:00.548 --> 00:17:06.930
but four and three -- this is a
four here,

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.492
it looks like a one -- four and
three would not be on top of one

00:17:09.492 --> 00:17:11.038
another when you slid them
together.

00:17:11.038 --> 00:17:13.660
And there's no way of twisting
it so it'll be right.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:13.894
Right?
 

00:17:13.894 --> 00:17:15.848
But there's a special
relationship between those.

00:17:15.848 --> 00:17:17.190
They're not completely
unrelated.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:18.809
What symmetry relates them?
 

00:17:18.809 --> 00:17:20.849
Do you see?
 

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:21.538
Zack?
 

00:17:21.538 --> 00:17:23.088
Student:  Right handed
and left handed?

00:17:23.088 --> 00:17:25.108
Prof: Yeah,
they're mirror images,

00:17:25.108 --> 00:17:26.775
like right-handed and
left-handed.

00:17:26.775 --> 00:17:27.230
Okay?
 

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.538
So he predicted that if you had
two double bonds in a row,

00:17:30.538 --> 00:17:33.240
with a common carbon in the
middle,

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.400
then you could get right and
left-handed,

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.690
where you can't get it with
just a double bond,

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.578
as in the maleic and fumaric
acid.

00:17:39.578 --> 00:17:41.702
Those aren't
"chiral",

00:17:41.702 --> 00:17:42.798
as we now say.
 

00:17:42.798 --> 00:17:46.380
But this wasn't shown until
1935.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.218
That's probably the longest
that there's been a correct

00:17:50.218 --> 00:17:53.203
theory proposed,
until the time that it was

00:17:53.203 --> 00:17:54.200
confirmed.
 

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.068
Or at least I don't know of
anything longer than that;

00:17:56.068 --> 00:17:59.269
sixty-one years after he
predicted it,

00:17:59.269 --> 00:18:02.730
before it was demonstrated to
be true.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.028
And it was proved,
you see, in the labs of

00:18:05.028 --> 00:18:07.271
E.P. Kohler,
the same guy we talked about

00:18:07.271 --> 00:18:08.170
last time.
 

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:12.529
And here's the molecule he
used, down on the bottom left.

00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:15.240
And we can enlarge it here.
 

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.578
So there it is.
 

00:18:16.578 --> 00:18:19.343
Now, that molecule,
as you look at it,

00:18:19.343 --> 00:18:22.779
would be superimposable on its
mirror image.

00:18:22.779 --> 00:18:24.720
It looks planar.
 

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.529
Right?
 

00:18:25.529 --> 00:18:26.769
Now let's think about that.
 

00:18:26.769 --> 00:18:29.368
The bonds at that carbon should
be tetrahedral.

00:18:29.368 --> 00:18:32.669
So one bond should be coming in
and out, or one pair of bonds,

00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:35.588
and the other pair of bonds
should lie in the plane.

00:18:35.588 --> 00:18:39.201
But if that's true,
then the one on the right would

00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:42.088
have its four bonds coplanar --
right?

00:18:42.088 --> 00:18:44.099
-- all in the plane of the
paper.

00:18:44.099 --> 00:18:45.910
So there's something wrong here.
 

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:48.711
And you can see what's wrong if
you think about the p

00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:50.848
orbitals that go into making a
double bond.

00:18:50.848 --> 00:18:51.500
Right?
 

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.400
What's wrong with that
arrangement?

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.538
Why don't the p orbitals
like it?

00:18:57.538 --> 00:18:58.910
Student:  They're
orthogonal.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:18:59.892
Prof: They're
orthogonal.

00:18:59.892 --> 00:19:00.778
They don't overlap,
right?

00:19:00.778 --> 00:19:03.441
What you need to do is to twist
it, like that,

00:19:03.441 --> 00:19:06.337
so that the groups,
C_10H_7_ and C_6H_5,

00:19:06.337 --> 00:19:08.288
come in and out of the plane.
 

00:19:08.288 --> 00:19:08.645
Right?
 

00:19:08.645 --> 00:19:12.265
And that's what then makes it
not superimposable on its mirror

00:19:12.265 --> 00:19:12.798
image.
 

00:19:12.798 --> 00:19:17.877
Okay, now if you wanted to
convert one mirror image to the

00:19:17.877 --> 00:19:20.336
other --
notice if you used the plane,

00:19:20.336 --> 00:19:22.230
something parallel to the
screen,

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.655
as a mirror,
what comes out in front of the

00:19:24.655 --> 00:19:26.910
mirror would be the same on the
left.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:31.772
But on the right C_10H_7 would
be back in, and C_6H_5 would be

00:19:31.772 --> 00:19:32.808
coming out.
 

00:19:32.808 --> 00:19:33.117
Right?
 

00:19:33.117 --> 00:19:36.306
So if you want to interconvert
these, you have to put ten where

00:19:36.306 --> 00:19:37.900
six is and six where ten is.
 

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.828
You have to rotate around the
bond.

00:19:39.828 --> 00:19:41.833
But to do that you have to
break the bond,

00:19:41.833 --> 00:19:43.250
because it's a double bond.
 

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.005
You'd have to go back to where
the p orbitals don't

00:19:46.005 --> 00:19:47.940
overlap and you lose the double
bond,

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.895
and then you can keep rotating
and get the other mirror image

00:19:51.895 --> 00:19:52.490
isomer.
 

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:52.792
Right?
 

00:19:52.792 --> 00:19:54.869
But you have to break a bond to
do that.

00:19:54.869 --> 00:19:57.970
So that's very tough.
 

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.538
Okay, now we were counting
isomers in homework for today.

00:20:01.538 --> 00:20:05.588
And this slide goes through and
counts them.

00:20:05.588 --> 00:20:08.416
I'm just going to begin it,
and then hustle through the

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:10.825
end, rather than go through it
in great detail,

00:20:10.825 --> 00:20:12.920
because you've already worked
on it.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.288
But this can be thought of as
an answer key.

00:20:15.288 --> 00:20:18.664
Okay, so we want to count how
many different mono-substituent

00:20:18.664 --> 00:20:20.859
positions there are in that
compound.

00:20:20.859 --> 00:20:22.670
There's one.
 

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:23.368
Okay?
 

00:20:23.368 --> 00:20:26.088
There's obviously a different
one, two.

00:20:26.088 --> 00:20:28.074
Now about three,
is that different,

00:20:28.074 --> 00:20:30.348
if you have just a
mono-substitution.

00:20:30.348 --> 00:20:31.618
Is the blue different from the
red?

00:20:31.618 --> 00:20:34.347
No, obviously because this
thing has rotational symmetry,

00:20:34.347 --> 00:20:36.980
you could rotate it;
put the red on top of the blue.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.000
So the blue's not a new one;
forget blue.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.480
Okay, now how about that blue
one, is that a new one?

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.614
No, because the one in the left
front would go,

00:20:49.614 --> 00:20:53.480
on that same rotation,
go the right rear.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.900
So that one doesn't count.
 

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.829
How about that one?
 

00:20:56.829 --> 00:20:57.880
Is that different or the same?
 

00:21:01.509 --> 00:21:05.095
Can you rotate it so the one on
the front left becomes the one

00:21:05.095 --> 00:21:06.329
on the front right?
 

00:21:06.329 --> 00:21:07.420
No.
 

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.028
So now we have a question.
 

00:21:09.028 --> 00:21:12.000
Is that something real about
the models?

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.439
Or is that just like the
sausages, that Kekulé

00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:16.971
used, that it suggests a
difference, when there's not a

00:21:16.971 --> 00:21:17.910
real difference?
 

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:18.890
Okay?
 

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.970
So, we'll put a question mark
on that one.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.976
Okay, so there are two isomers,
if we don't count the two on

00:21:25.976 --> 00:21:29.913
the bottom, and there's an
additional isomer if we do count

00:21:29.913 --> 00:21:30.390
it.
 

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.702
Okay?
 

00:21:30.702 --> 00:21:33.957
So there are either two
isomers, or conceivably three

00:21:33.957 --> 00:21:35.460
isomers, of that one.
 

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.230
Okay, and notice that this one,
the third one in,

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.176
has exactly the same
arrangement among the hydrogens

00:21:41.176 --> 00:21:42.390
as the first one.
 

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:45.909
So the numbers would be the
same: two and an additional one,

00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:47.578
if you count those extras.
 

00:21:47.578 --> 00:21:51.125
Now here, you have obviously
three different positions you

00:21:51.125 --> 00:21:53.798
can have for mono -- top,
middle, bottom.

00:21:53.798 --> 00:21:57.673
But also the ones on the right
are not superimposable on the

00:21:57.673 --> 00:22:00.890
ones on the left,
if this is three-dimensional.

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:03.190
So you could have another
three, if they count.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:04.900
And so on.
 

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:09.272
I'll not go through these --
notice -- except to note in this

00:22:09.272 --> 00:22:13.210
one that there's obviously top
here and these three.

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:15.681
Now the question is,
are those three different or

00:22:15.681 --> 00:22:15.990
not?
 

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:19.521
And we're following van't Hoff
here and saying it rotates

00:22:19.521 --> 00:22:20.910
rapidly around here.
 

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:24.019
So on time-average you won't be
able to put those in separate

00:22:24.019 --> 00:22:24.900
bottles, right?
 

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.190
They're going to interconvert
too rapidly to count.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.608
So there'll be three.
 

00:22:28.608 --> 00:22:33.823
But the two on the top are not
really -- they're not

00:22:33.823 --> 00:22:38.220
superimposable by rotation,
in the model.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:38.411
Okay?
 

00:22:38.411 --> 00:22:40.588
So the question is whether you
have that additional one.

00:22:40.588 --> 00:22:42.490
And in prismane there's only
one.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:45.433
And then if you go
disubstituted,

00:22:45.433 --> 00:22:50.219
if we start on the left,
if you start with one on the

00:22:50.219 --> 00:22:54.083
top here, you can have the
second one here,

00:22:54.083 --> 00:22:56.200
or here, or here.
 

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.400
That's clearly three.
 

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.358
But there might -- this one is
not superimposable.

00:23:01.358 --> 00:23:04.883
That is, if you have this one
already, this one and this one,

00:23:04.883 --> 00:23:07.818
as sites for the second,
are not superimposable.

00:23:07.818 --> 00:23:08.095
Right?
 

00:23:08.095 --> 00:23:10.804
So maybe we need another one
there and another one over here

00:23:10.804 --> 00:23:11.308
as well.
 

00:23:11.308 --> 00:23:12.900
So there might be an additional
two.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.608
And again, this is the same as
that one.

00:23:14.608 --> 00:23:17.058
And you can go through this --
and presumably you have done.

00:23:17.058 --> 00:23:19.828
But anyhow these are the
answers I got.

00:23:19.828 --> 00:23:22.009
And if you found something
different, let me know.

00:23:22.009 --> 00:23:24.599
Maybe you saw something I
didn't see.

00:23:24.599 --> 00:23:26.029
Okay, so that's interesting.
 

00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:27.809
Now mirror images.
 

00:23:27.809 --> 00:23:30.000
Here's me with a mirror image.
 

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.910
Right?
 

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.068
Now this is a question.
 

00:23:33.068 --> 00:23:36.640
Why does a mirror exchange
right and left,

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.210
but it doesn't exchange top and
bottom?

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.640
How does the mirror know which
way gravity points?

00:23:46.608 --> 00:23:50.392
Or how about if I lay on my
side when I looked in the

00:23:50.392 --> 00:23:54.828
mirror, would it still exchange
left and right and not top and

00:23:54.828 --> 00:23:55.630
bottom?
 

00:23:55.630 --> 00:24:01.140
I'm talking about plane
mirrors, not funhouse mirrors.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.528
That's an interesting problem,
right?

00:24:04.528 --> 00:24:10.215
But notice, it doesn't change
either, because top is on top

00:24:10.215 --> 00:24:12.569
and right is on right.
 

00:24:12.569 --> 00:24:14.539
It didn't change right and left.
 

00:24:14.539 --> 00:24:16.690
It left right on right.
 

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:20.108
What did it change?
 

00:24:20.108 --> 00:24:23.338
Why does the mirror image look
different from the real image,

00:24:23.338 --> 00:24:26.622
if it doesn't change right and
left, and it doesn't change top

00:24:26.622 --> 00:24:27.430
and bottom?
 

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:28.730
Student:  Front.
 

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.348
Prof: It changes front
to back, or in and out.

00:24:31.348 --> 00:24:31.700
Right?
 

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.792
Because my original self,
you see the back of my head,

00:24:34.792 --> 00:24:37.769
and in the mirror image you see
the front of me.

00:24:37.769 --> 00:24:43.009
So what a mirror changes is in
and out, not right and left.

00:24:43.009 --> 00:24:45.578
Okay?
 

00:24:45.578 --> 00:24:49.838
But our intuition interprets
that as rotation.

00:24:49.838 --> 00:24:53.369
Because if I look like this,
and I go like this,

00:24:53.369 --> 00:24:56.298
you expect it to change,
the right hand,

00:24:56.298 --> 00:24:59.980
because you're accustomed to
people rotating.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:04.069
You're not expecting me to go
pfff, like that and turn inside

00:25:04.069 --> 00:25:04.480
out.
 

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.690
Right?
 

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.920
&gt;
 

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.019
Okay, so people don't invert.
 

00:25:10.019 --> 00:25:14.612
So our mind makes us think that
the person we see in the mirror

00:25:14.612 --> 00:25:18.316
has turned 180°,
so that the right should be on

00:25:18.316 --> 00:25:19.278
the left.
 

00:25:19.278 --> 00:25:19.741
Okay?
 

00:25:19.741 --> 00:25:24.088
And, of course,
this is not a new observation.

00:25:24.088 --> 00:25:26.278
Through the
Looking-Glass -- you know,

00:25:26.278 --> 00:25:28.318
Lewis Carroll,
and Alice going through.

00:25:28.318 --> 00:25:31.140
And here are successive
pictures in that book.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:35.954
There she is looking into the
glass, and we turn the page,

00:25:35.954 --> 00:25:40.009
and here she is coming out,
on the other side.

00:25:40.009 --> 00:25:41.950
Now notice something about this.
 

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:45.990
That's her right arm.
 

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.410
Right?
 

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:54.680
And in the previous picture it
was also her right arm.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.940
That's not the way the mirror
image should look.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:02.022
It should've changed the way it
looks, when you go from back to

00:26:02.022 --> 00:26:02.549
front.
 

00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:03.980
Okay?
 

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.289
Now, Lewis Carroll was a smart
guy.

00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:08.740
He taught mathematics at Oxford.
 

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.390
Right?
 

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:12.740
But of course he didn't draw
the picture.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.358
The picture was drawn by John
Tenniel.

00:26:15.358 --> 00:26:21.058
And it turned out that John
Tenniel was blind in one eye;

00:26:21.058 --> 00:26:24.000
a fact I only discovered
yesterday, on Wikipedia.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.568
&gt;
 

00:26:26.568 --> 00:26:30.670
So is that the reason that he's
unable to perceive depth,

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.720
and draws the wrong thing?
 

00:26:36.019 --> 00:26:38.088
No, it's much more subtle than
that.

00:26:38.088 --> 00:26:41.747
Notice that the name of the
book is Through the

00:26:41.747 --> 00:26:43.240
Looking-Glass.
 

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:47.151
She moved through the
looking-glass and her right arm

00:26:47.151 --> 00:26:48.279
stayed right.
 

00:26:48.279 --> 00:26:51.390
But if she had been reflected
in the looking-glass,

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:54.788
if the title had been chosen to
be In the Looking Glass,

00:26:54.788 --> 00:26:56.618
rather than Through the
Looking-Glass,

00:26:56.618 --> 00:27:00.161
then when you looked at the
mirror image it would've been

00:27:00.161 --> 00:27:01.109
the left arm.
 

00:27:01.109 --> 00:27:02.019
That's sort of cute.
 

00:27:02.019 --> 00:27:05.140
So Carroll is more subtle than
you might give him credit for;

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.809
or John Tenniel, or both.
 

00:27:07.809 --> 00:27:08.460
Okay?
 

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.269
Or look even further in the
book.

00:27:10.269 --> 00:27:12.960
This was, notice, 1872.
 

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.430
What was going on in chemistry
in 1872?

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:20.111
Wislicenus was studying these
isomers of lactic acid,

00:27:20.111 --> 00:27:24.076
the Scheele and the Liebig,
and showing that they had the

00:27:24.076 --> 00:27:26.980
same constitution but were
different.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.278
Okay?
 

00:27:28.278 --> 00:27:30.650
So look what happens here when
she's talking to her kitty.

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.230
"Now, if you'll only
attend Kitty,

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:35.109
and not talk so much,
I'll tell you all my ideas

00:27:35.109 --> 00:27:37.069
about Looking-glass
House…

00:27:37.069 --> 00:27:40.380
Well then the books are
something like our books,

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:41.808
only the words go the wrong way.
 

00:27:41.808 --> 00:27:44.929
I know that because I've held
up one of our books to the

00:27:44.929 --> 00:27:46.874
glass,
and then they hold up the one

00:27:46.874 --> 00:27:49.644
in the other room…
How would you like to live in a

00:27:49.644 --> 00:27:51.130
Looking-Glass House,
Kitty?

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:55.098
I wonder if they'd give you
milk, there?

00:27:55.098 --> 00:28:01.058
Perhaps Looking-glass milk
isn't good to drink."

00:28:01.058 --> 00:28:05.152
Because in the college Carroll
knew Vernon Harcourt,

00:28:05.152 --> 00:28:08.923
who was a chemist who was
involved in this work,

00:28:08.923 --> 00:28:10.528
with Wislicenus.
 

00:28:10.528 --> 00:28:14.580
So almost certainly they'd had
conversations about lactic acid,

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.150
the mirror image form.
 

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:16.615
Right?
 

00:28:16.615 --> 00:28:19.950
So there's a lot of stuff in
Alice.

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.781
So was he referring maybe to
sarcolactic acid,

00:28:22.781 --> 00:28:26.368
the one that comes from meat
instead of from sour milk?

00:28:26.368 --> 00:28:28.957
Anyhow, chirality comes
from the Greek word

00:28:28.957 --> 00:28:30.700
"χÑ”
iρ",

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.380
which means hand;
it's handedness.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.538
So there's a right hand.
 

00:28:35.538 --> 00:28:38.982
Now let's talk about…
and Lord Kelvin coined the

00:28:38.982 --> 00:28:39.430
word.
 

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:41.730
He said, "I call any
geometric figure,

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:44.622
or group of points,
chiral, and say it has

00:28:44.622 --> 00:28:47.134
chirality,
if its imagine in a plane

00:28:47.134 --> 00:28:49.497
mirror, ideally
realized…"

00:28:49.497 --> 00:28:52.880
(so don't take into account
moles or a fingernail that

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.963
hasn't been trimmed or something
like that) "…ideally

00:28:56.963 --> 00:28:59.644
realized,
cannot be brought to coincide

00:28:59.644 --> 00:29:00.690
with itself."
 

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:02.858
(By rotation and so on.)
 

00:29:02.858 --> 00:29:03.092
Okay?
 

00:29:03.092 --> 00:29:05.698
So let's consider x,
y, z coordinate

00:29:05.698 --> 00:29:06.210
systems.
 

00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:11.542
So there are points for every
point on the surface of the

00:29:11.542 --> 00:29:12.210
hand.
 

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:16.010
And I could make an image of it
by changing some of the signs of

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:17.400
some of these things.
 

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.266
For example,
I could leave all the z

00:29:20.266 --> 00:29:22.858
and y coordinates
identical,

00:29:22.858 --> 00:29:26.411
but change the sign of
x, which would move

00:29:26.411 --> 00:29:30.480
things from being on that side
to being on this side.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.490
Got the idea?
 

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:35.635
Okay, so I'm going to make a
new hand, that looks like the

00:29:35.635 --> 00:29:37.511
original one,
except every x

00:29:37.511 --> 00:29:39.500
coordinate has changed its sign.
 

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.381
Change all the x
coordinates and we get that --

00:29:42.381 --> 00:29:43.359
everyone see it?
 

00:29:43.359 --> 00:29:44.808
-- ideally realized.
 

00:29:44.808 --> 00:29:46.490
The shadow is a little
different and so on;

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:49.875
but ideally realized,
those are the ones that have

00:29:49.875 --> 00:29:51.190
done that, right?
 

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.848
Changed one sign.
 

00:29:52.848 --> 00:29:56.372
Now is one hand right and the
other hand left,

00:29:56.372 --> 00:29:58.329
or are they both right?
 

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:03.470
Okay?
 

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:08.487
So what kind of relationship
would you say there is between

00:30:08.487 --> 00:30:09.180
these?
 

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:13.275
Are they superimposable or are
they non-superimposable mirror

00:30:13.275 --> 00:30:13.890
images?
 

00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:19.588
Can you rotate and put one on
top, exactly to coincide with

00:30:19.588 --> 00:30:20.068
the other?
 

00:30:20.068 --> 00:30:22.190
No, because they're a right
hand and a left hand.

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:26.364
But that operation,
changing the sign of x,

00:30:26.364 --> 00:30:31.219
corresponds to reflecting in a
mirror, which is yz,

00:30:31.219 --> 00:30:33.519
in the yz plane.
 

00:30:33.519 --> 00:30:35.059
Everybody got it?
 

00:30:35.059 --> 00:30:35.940
Leaves y and z.
 

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.604
That's like leaving top,
top and right,

00:30:38.604 --> 00:30:41.619
right, but changing in and out,
this way.

00:30:41.619 --> 00:30:42.940
Okay? So that's a mirror.
 

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.766
Now, what would happen if we
changed all the y

00:30:46.766 --> 00:30:48.900
coordinates -- can you see?
 

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.410
-- but left x and
z the same?

00:30:54.609 --> 00:30:57.910
Then you'd get this.
 

00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:59.380
Okay?
 

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:03.490
And what does that correspond
to?

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:05.240
Is that a rotation or a mirror?
 

00:31:12.608 --> 00:31:15.019
Student:  It's a
rotation of your left hand.

00:31:15.019 --> 00:31:17.529
Prof: So are they both
left hands?

00:31:17.529 --> 00:31:20.700
This one, right?
 

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.586
And this is a right hand,
incidentally,

00:31:22.586 --> 00:31:23.480
not a left hand.
 

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.400
Student:  That one and
that one are left hands.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.203
Prof: And if I rotate
it, it would look like that,

00:31:27.203 --> 00:31:27.396
right?
 

00:31:27.396 --> 00:31:28.299
Is that the way it looks?
 

00:31:28.299 --> 00:31:30.410
No, it looks like that.
 

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:30.753
Right?
 

00:31:30.753 --> 00:31:33.108
So what was the operation that
did that?

00:31:33.108 --> 00:31:34.990
Mathematically it's changing
the sign.

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:38.788
But how would you describe it,
in terms of mirrors and things

00:31:38.788 --> 00:31:39.548
like that?
 

00:31:39.548 --> 00:31:41.038
Student:  Horizontal
mirror.

00:31:41.038 --> 00:31:45.266
Prof: It's a horizontal
mirror, that leaves right/left,

00:31:45.266 --> 00:31:47.759
in/out the same,
but changes up/down,

00:31:47.759 --> 00:31:48.798
top/bottom.
 

00:31:48.798 --> 00:31:51.210
Okay, so that's reflection in
an xz mirror.

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:54.558
Now suppose we changed the sign
of all the z coordinates.

00:31:54.558 --> 00:31:56.170
Can you guess what that's going
to do?

00:31:59.569 --> 00:32:01.470
Prof: Not rotation.
 

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:05.480
Change the sign of z.
 

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.150
So that's going to give that
one.

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:11.348
Change in and out,
but leave right/left and back

00:32:11.348 --> 00:32:15.278
-- change right/left and top --
pardon me.

00:32:15.278 --> 00:32:18.798
Leave right/left,
leave top/bottom,

00:32:18.798 --> 00:32:20.868
but change in/out.
 

00:32:20.868 --> 00:32:24.170
That gives the one in front,
this one, right?

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:27.298
Okay, so that's reflection in
the xy mirror.

00:32:27.298 --> 00:32:31.657
Now, there's some -- we've
occupied now four of the

00:32:31.657 --> 00:32:32.528
octants.
 

00:32:32.528 --> 00:32:35.108
But we can occupy the other
four as well.

00:32:35.108 --> 00:32:38.141
For example,
we can change the sign of all

00:32:38.141 --> 00:32:42.058
x and y,
but leave z the same.

00:32:42.058 --> 00:32:44.630
Can you see what that's going
to do?

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:47.902
Change x,
change y,

00:32:47.902 --> 00:32:50.970
but leave z the same.
 

00:32:55.009 --> 00:32:56.259
There.
 

00:32:56.259 --> 00:32:57.559
And what operation was that?
 

00:32:57.559 --> 00:32:58.990
Was that a mirror?
 

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:00.130
Student:  Rotation.
 

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:02.640
Prof: Rotation about
what?

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.650
About z axis,
the one that didn't change.

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:05.960
Right?
 

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.704
How about if we -- that's
rotation around the z

00:33:08.704 --> 00:33:09.118
axis.
 

00:33:09.118 --> 00:33:11.832
How about if we change all the
x and z's,

00:33:11.832 --> 00:33:13.339
but leave y the same?
 

00:33:13.339 --> 00:33:14.269
What's that going to do?
 

00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:17.579
That's easy,
once you know the previous one.

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:25.150
That's going to rotate about
the y axis.

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:25.578
Right?
 

00:33:25.578 --> 00:33:28.546
And how about if we change the
sign of y and z,

00:33:28.546 --> 00:33:30.029
and leave x the same?
 

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.548
Sophie do you see?
 

00:33:37.548 --> 00:33:40.251
So we're going to change the
sign of y and change the

00:33:40.251 --> 00:33:42.038
sign of z,
from the original one,

00:33:42.038 --> 00:33:42.680
back here.
 

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:46.104
We're going to change y,
up and down,

00:33:46.104 --> 00:33:50.858
and we're going to change --
z did I say?

00:33:50.858 --> 00:33:53.240
-- yes, z,
in and out, from this one.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:04.240
There's that one, right?
 

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:08.719
That changes in and out and it
changes up and down.

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:09.186
Right?
 

00:34:09.186 --> 00:34:12.766
And what it is,
is rotation around the x

00:34:12.766 --> 00:34:13.389
axis.
 

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:18.800
Now there's one octant that
hasn't been occupied yet;

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.349
the one that's out front,
top left.

00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:23.750
Can you see how you get there?
 

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:26.699
What haven't we done yet?
 

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:28.018
Kate?
 

00:34:28.018 --> 00:34:29.739
Student:  You have to
try and change all three.

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:34.601
Prof: If you change all
three, x and y and

00:34:34.601 --> 00:34:39.150
z, then you come up there
and get the eighth one.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:39.766
Okay?
 

00:34:39.766 --> 00:34:43.219
Now what operation is that?
 

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:47.130
It's inversion through the
center of symmetry.

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:49.452
It's what I tried to do by
pffff, like that,

00:34:49.452 --> 00:34:51.719
but I couldn't change myself
inside out.

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:53.309
Right?
 

00:34:53.309 --> 00:34:56.030
So there's the center of
symmetry there.

00:34:56.030 --> 00:35:00.297
And every point on the back has
one the same distance and along

00:35:00.297 --> 00:35:02.500
the same vector,
to the front;

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:06.619
right there,
or to the base of my thumb.

00:35:06.619 --> 00:35:06.938
Okay?
 

00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:09.943
So here there are -- we looked
at three mirrors,

00:35:09.943 --> 00:35:12.309
three rotations,
and an inversion.

00:35:12.309 --> 00:35:16.809
Some of them changed right to
left, and some of them didn't.

00:35:16.809 --> 00:35:18.969
Some of them were
superimposable.

00:35:18.969 --> 00:35:20.079
Right?
 

00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:23.079
Can you see,
in terms of changing signs,

00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:27.695
what determines whether it's
going to be the same hand or the

00:35:27.695 --> 00:35:28.849
other hand?
 

00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:29.980
Angela?
 

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.835
Student:  If there's
been reflection then it would be

00:35:31.835 --> 00:35:32.369
the other hand.
 

00:35:32.369 --> 00:35:34.000
Prof: Reflection changes
hands.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.059
So if you change x or
y or z.

00:35:36.059 --> 00:35:37.650
Any other way to change hands?
 

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:40.070
Student:  Or you can
invert.

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:41.637
Prof: If you change
everything, x and

00:35:41.637 --> 00:35:42.389
y and z.
 

00:35:42.389 --> 00:35:48.650
So if you change an odd number,
then you change the hand.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.690
Okay?
 

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:52.715
So chirality,
handedness, is

00:35:52.715 --> 00:35:56.842
non-superimposable mirror
images, and it involves an odd

00:35:56.842 --> 00:35:59.619
number of changes of
coordinates.

00:35:59.619 --> 00:36:03.449
Now notice the right hand has
only one mirror image;

00:36:03.449 --> 00:36:06.090
the right and the left are
mirror images of one another.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:09.150
I can put the mirror image
here, or I can put it here,

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:10.480
or I can put it here.
 

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:10.891
Right?
 

00:36:10.891 --> 00:36:14.530
So which mirror I use
determines where the new hand is

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:15.559
going to be.
 

00:36:15.559 --> 00:36:18.789
But it's always the same mirror
image.

00:36:18.789 --> 00:36:20.010
Okay?
 

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:25.159
Just generates it in different
locations and orientations.

00:36:25.159 --> 00:36:28.260
Now, this is a special
property, handedness.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:29.360
Right?
 

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.199
Or is it an everyday property.
 

00:36:32.199 --> 00:36:32.601
Right?
 

00:36:32.601 --> 00:36:34.409
We've looked at molecules.
 

00:36:34.409 --> 00:36:37.599
Van't Hoff was able to come up
with what?

00:36:37.599 --> 00:36:40.351
about less than a dozen
examples from all the molecules

00:36:40.351 --> 00:36:42.289
that had been known up to that
time.

00:36:42.289 --> 00:36:44.630
So what do you think?
 

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:50.724
Do you think most molecules are
chiral, or do you think most

00:36:50.724 --> 00:36:54.340
organic molecules are not
chiral?

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:58.885
Well we had an exciting night
last night and learned about the

00:36:58.885 --> 00:37:00.449
democratic process.
 

00:37:00.449 --> 00:37:04.420
So the way to settle such a
question is to vote.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:08.219
Okay, so how many -- we're
going to vote on how special is

00:37:08.219 --> 00:37:09.019
chirality.
 

00:37:09.019 --> 00:37:10.820
First, very special, right?
 

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.230
only unusual molecules will
have it.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:16.431
Or, on the other hand…
like these carbons that have

00:37:16.431 --> 00:37:17.780
four different things.
 

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:19.846
Or the alternative,
it's very general,

00:37:19.846 --> 00:37:23.309
and what's unusual is ones that
are achiral, not like hands.

00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:24.539
So here we go.
 

00:37:24.539 --> 00:37:30.489
How many people think that
chirality is pretty special?

00:37:30.489 --> 00:37:31.849
Okay.
 

00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:33.639
It'll be a little like Indiana.
 

00:37:33.639 --> 00:37:37.849
How many people think chirality
is not so special?

00:37:37.849 --> 00:37:39.239
Ah, not very many.
 

00:37:39.239 --> 00:37:40.739
That's what I anticipated.
 

00:37:40.739 --> 00:37:44.050
It's pretty special.
 

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:45.679
The class voted overwhelmingly
&gt;

00:37:45.679 --> 00:37:49.179
there should be more achiral
than chiral molecules.

00:37:49.179 --> 00:37:53.519
And the voice of the people is
the voice of God.

00:37:53.519 --> 00:37:56.800
Right?
 

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.690
So let's look at words.
 

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:01.568
"You can use words,"
Alice said, holding up her book

00:38:01.568 --> 00:38:02.230
to a mirror.
 

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:06.923
Okay, so here's a message:
LET'S DECODE AT NOON BUT

00:38:06.923 --> 00:38:09.050
KEEP IT MUM. Okay?
 

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:12.501
Now let's make the -- change
the sign of x,

00:38:12.501 --> 00:38:15.110
so we get the mirror image of
this.

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:15.940
Okay?
 

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:18.050
It looks like nonsense.
 

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:19.679
Is there anything special?
 

00:38:19.679 --> 00:38:20.760
Students:  MUM.
 

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:25.224
Prof: MUM;
MUM is its own mirror

00:38:25.224 --> 00:38:25.889
image.
 

00:38:25.889 --> 00:38:29.320
Thus it's not handed,
it's achiral.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:29.632
Right?
 

00:38:29.632 --> 00:38:32.911
But it's the only word that has
-- that when you change the sign

00:38:32.911 --> 00:38:34.630
of x it stays the same.
 

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:36.869
It's pretty special to be
achiral;

00:38:36.869 --> 00:38:38.494
to be MUM,
at least, okay,

00:38:38.494 --> 00:38:38.849
here.
 

00:38:38.849 --> 00:38:41.639
Now any other words look
interesting?

00:38:41.639 --> 00:38:42.920
Students:  NOON.
 

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.119
Prof: NOON looks
sort of interesting.

00:38:45.119 --> 00:38:48.070
Is it superimposable on its
mirror image?

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:49.309
No.
 

00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:53.010
So it's chiral,
handed, like most words.

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:54.789
You can have a right or a
left-handed NOON.

00:38:54.789 --> 00:38:56.530
It does have symmetry though.
 

00:38:56.530 --> 00:39:00.081
Watch what happens if we,
instead of using a mirror,

00:39:00.081 --> 00:39:02.449
rotate the message on the
right.

00:39:02.449 --> 00:39:05.380
So change both x and
y.

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:08.739
And now you notice what?
 

00:39:08.739 --> 00:39:10.880
NOON is the same.
 

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.179
So it has symmetry.
 

00:39:12.179 --> 00:39:15.320
It has rotational symmetry --
right?

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.340
-- but not mirror -- okay?
 

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.739
-- in two-dimensions.
 

00:39:19.739 --> 00:39:22.507
So it has rotational symmetry,
but that doesn't keep from

00:39:22.507 --> 00:39:23.250
being chiral.
 

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:28.599
Like a propeller is chiral;
it has rotational symmetry.

00:39:28.599 --> 00:39:33.449
Okay, now let's mirror by
changing the sign of y.

00:39:33.449 --> 00:39:35.110
Anything special here?
 

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.909
What?
 

00:39:39.909 --> 00:39:40.760
Student:  DECODE.
 

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:44.519
Prof: DECODE is
the same.

00:39:44.519 --> 00:39:48.360
So DECODE is a meso-word.
 

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.909
Right? It's achiral.
 

00:39:50.909 --> 00:39:54.056
But it's harder to recognize
because we're not accustomed to

00:39:54.056 --> 00:39:56.349
dealing with mirrors that are
horizontal.

00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:58.460
We're much more familiar with
mirrors that are vertical.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:01.916
So it's much easier to see it
in MUM than to see it in

00:40:01.916 --> 00:40:02.840
DECODE.
 

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:06.670
So you can amaze your roommates
with that.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.369
Okay, so how special is
chirality?

00:40:09.369 --> 00:40:12.840
In the case of words it's not
at all special.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.260
Right?
 

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:16.914
What's special is to be
achiral, to have some kind of

00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:18.320
special symmetry.
 

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.329
Almost all words are chiral.
 

00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:22.434
But there are certain achiral,
or meso-words,

00:40:22.434 --> 00:40:24.300
such as MUM and
DECODE.

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.340
But they're very rare.
 

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:27.230
Okay?
 

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:28.710
It's the same with molecules.
 

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:32.179
Almost all molecules are chiral.
 

00:40:32.179 --> 00:40:35.086
But if you work with very,
very simple ones,

00:40:35.086 --> 00:40:39.077
as you do when you begin to do
chemistry, then a lot of them

00:40:39.077 --> 00:40:40.159
are achiral.
 

00:40:40.159 --> 00:40:42.789
But it's a very atypical
example.

00:40:42.789 --> 00:40:47.619
Essentially every molecule in
you is chiral.

00:40:47.619 --> 00:40:49.427
All your amino acids,
all the sugars,

00:40:49.427 --> 00:40:51.239
everything;
almost everything.

00:40:51.239 --> 00:40:55.780
Fatty acids aren't chiral,
but when they're parts of fats

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.239
they are chiral.
 

00:40:57.239 --> 00:40:59.679
Okay?
 

00:40:59.679 --> 00:41:02.452
But when we deal with very
simple molecules,

00:41:02.452 --> 00:41:05.159
we often encounter achiral or
meso ones.

00:41:05.159 --> 00:41:08.480
Now, we're going to go beyond
constitution into

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.780
stereochemistry.
 

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:11.920
So we've talked about
composition.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.657
We've talked about
constitution,

00:41:13.657 --> 00:41:15.619
the nature and sequence of
bonds.

00:41:15.619 --> 00:41:19.606
And now we're going to go into
configuration and conformation,

00:41:19.606 --> 00:41:20.849
the other two Cs.
 

00:41:20.849 --> 00:41:24.396
These last three Cs all have to
do with isomers,

00:41:24.396 --> 00:41:28.545
but there's a difference in
that the last two have to do

00:41:28.545 --> 00:41:32.887
with arrangement in space;
what the traditional chemists

00:41:32.887 --> 00:41:36.039
warned the young folks not to
think about,

00:41:36.039 --> 00:41:41.532
in the third-quarter and the
early fourth-quarter of the 19th

00:41:41.532 --> 00:41:44.152
century,
and what the Encyclopedia

00:41:44.152 --> 00:41:46.989
Britannica still didn't know
about by 1911.

00:41:46.989 --> 00:41:48.469
Okay?
 

00:41:48.469 --> 00:41:51.045
But what's the difference
between configuration and

00:41:51.045 --> 00:41:51.820
confirmation?
 

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:54.809
The distinction is based on the
model we make.

00:41:54.809 --> 00:41:56.130
Right?
 

00:41:56.130 --> 00:42:02.106
And because configurational
isomers relate to one another by

00:42:02.106 --> 00:42:03.929
breaking a bond.
 

00:42:03.929 --> 00:42:06.853
You have to break a bond to go
from one to the other and

00:42:06.853 --> 00:42:08.130
reassemble the pieces.
 

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:08.860
Right?
 

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.182
But when you're talking about
conformation,

00:42:11.182 --> 00:42:13.949
you can do it by rotating from
one to the other.

00:42:13.949 --> 00:42:16.844
So Paternó
was talking about isomers that

00:42:16.844 --> 00:42:18.199
related by rotation.
 

00:42:18.199 --> 00:42:22.070
His particular ones rotate so
easily that it's very hard to

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:24.539
see different isomers,
in his case.

00:42:24.539 --> 00:42:24.842
Right?
 

00:42:24.842 --> 00:42:27.373
Although you can get
information about that kind of

00:42:27.373 --> 00:42:27.829
thing.
 

00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:28.840
Right?
 

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.349
But the ones that require
breaking a bond,

00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:34.838
to go from one to the other,
those are much easier to deal

00:42:34.838 --> 00:42:35.389
with.
 

00:42:35.389 --> 00:42:35.722
Right?
 

00:42:35.722 --> 00:42:38.000
And so we have different names
for them.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.335
But it relates only to the
model we use,

00:42:41.335 --> 00:42:45.869
talking about bonds,
whether you break them or not.

00:42:45.869 --> 00:42:49.498
And you won't be surprised to
hear that there are some bonds

00:42:49.498 --> 00:42:53.067
that are so easy to break that
it's easier to convert those

00:42:53.067 --> 00:42:56.266
configurational isomers than it
is to convert certain

00:42:56.266 --> 00:42:59.664
conformational isomers;
where formally all you have to

00:42:59.664 --> 00:43:02.733
do is rotate about a bond,
but in the process other things

00:43:02.733 --> 00:43:05.480
run into one another and make it
very difficult.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.099
So configuration and
conformation relates to the

00:43:08.099 --> 00:43:11.498
models we draw of the molecules,
not to something the molecule

00:43:11.498 --> 00:43:13.559
itself fundamentally knows
about.

00:43:13.559 --> 00:43:17.110
So that one's hard to get back
and forth, and that one's easy,

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:20.534
typically;
but it doesn't have to be that

00:43:20.534 --> 00:43:20.989
way.
 

00:43:20.989 --> 00:43:21.590
Okay?
 

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:25.210
So all isomers represent local
energy minima;

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:27.217
that is, if you were at a low
enough temperature,

00:43:27.217 --> 00:43:29.730
the molecule could sit in that
structure and just vibrate;

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:33.349
have a zero-point amplitude of
vibration around that particular

00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:34.050
structure.
 

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:36.039
But then you can get from one
to another.

00:43:36.039 --> 00:43:39.347
You don't take every possible
structure, as Paternó

00:43:39.347 --> 00:43:41.322
tried to do,
and say that all these

00:43:41.322 --> 00:43:42.889
structures are isomers.
 

00:43:42.889 --> 00:43:45.260
Because then there'd be an
infinite number and they

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:47.394
wouldn't last any time,
because they're always

00:43:47.394 --> 00:43:48.059
vibrating.
 

00:43:48.059 --> 00:43:50.309
But you can vibrate within a
little well here,

00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:52.659
or a little well here,
or a little well here.

00:43:52.659 --> 00:43:55.443
And those are different
isomers, not just different

00:43:55.443 --> 00:43:56.670
phases of vibration.
 

00:43:56.670 --> 00:44:00.831
Now, the words of
stereochemistry often involve

00:44:00.831 --> 00:44:02.280
relationships.
 

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.155
For example,
two molecules that have exactly

00:44:05.155 --> 00:44:08.565
the same constitution,
nature and sequence of bonds,

00:44:08.565 --> 00:44:09.969
can be identical.
 

00:44:09.969 --> 00:44:11.940
Okay? They're superimposable.
 

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:15.108
And if you wanted a name for
that you would call them

00:44:15.108 --> 00:44:15.780
homomers.
 

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:19.271
But no one needs to use that
because it's always the same

00:44:19.271 --> 00:44:19.768
thing.
 

00:44:19.768 --> 00:44:22.429
So that word doesn't really
exist.

00:44:22.429 --> 00:44:26.990
But if they're just completely
different, then you call them

00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:30.083
diastereomers,
which has the same root as

00:44:30.083 --> 00:44:32.766
diameter;
things that are as far apart as

00:44:32.766 --> 00:44:33.849
you can get, right?
 

00:44:33.849 --> 00:44:35.530
They're just plain different.
 

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:37.329
Those are diastereomers.
 

00:44:37.329 --> 00:44:39.188
But they have the same
constitution,

00:44:39.188 --> 00:44:42.057
the same nature and sequence of
bonds, but they're just

00:44:42.057 --> 00:44:44.980
completely different in their
arrangement in space.

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:48.179
Or there can be a very special
relation in space.

00:44:48.179 --> 00:44:49.750
You know what that is?
 

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:51.099
Students:  Mirror image.
 

00:44:51.099 --> 00:44:53.197
Prof: They could be
mirror images,

00:44:53.197 --> 00:44:56.186
which are not the same thing,
but they're going to be very

00:44:56.186 --> 00:44:57.760
similar, in many respects.
 

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:58.480
Right?
 

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.360
So that one has a special name.
 

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.489
Diastereomer just means
different.

00:45:02.489 --> 00:45:06.989
But enantiomer means mirror
image.

00:45:06.989 --> 00:45:09.900
Right?
 

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:12.777
Okay, so these are
relationships between two

00:45:12.777 --> 00:45:13.579
molecules.
 

00:45:13.579 --> 00:45:19.719
You say this molecule is the
enantiomer of this molecule.

00:45:19.719 --> 00:45:21.099
Okay?
 

00:45:21.099 --> 00:45:23.884
Now we need to talk about
things like this,

00:45:23.884 --> 00:45:25.409
as Lavoisier told us.
 

00:45:25.409 --> 00:45:27.806
We need to think about the
facts, the ideas,

00:45:27.806 --> 00:45:28.699
and the words.
 

00:45:28.699 --> 00:45:32.949
And when we come to words,
now we need to convey such

00:45:32.949 --> 00:45:35.809
complicated ideas,
we need pictures,

00:45:35.809 --> 00:45:38.179
not just written letters.
 

00:45:38.179 --> 00:45:43.059
Okay, so we need pictures for
our notation that will show this

00:45:43.059 --> 00:45:44.500
third dimension.
 

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:47.320
Now, there are a number of
tricks that you can use to do

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:47.679
that.
 

00:45:47.679 --> 00:45:50.840
Can you see what's being used
here,

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:54.461
in this particular picture of
-- which is an old-fashioned

00:45:54.461 --> 00:45:57.958
picture when laptop computers
were new and they had very

00:45:57.958 --> 00:45:59.230
simple programs.
 

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:00.179
Yeah.
 

00:46:00.179 --> 00:46:01.389
Student:  Relative size.
 

00:46:01.389 --> 00:46:02.250
Prof: I can't hear.
 

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:03.210
Student:  Relative size.
 

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:04.719
Prof: Relative size is
one, right.

00:46:04.719 --> 00:46:07.510
The hydrogens that are far back
are small.

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:08.489
Anything else?
 

00:46:08.489 --> 00:46:12.969
Any other clues that show the
three dimensions?

00:46:12.969 --> 00:46:15.579
Yeah.
 

00:46:15.579 --> 00:46:17.260
Student:  Slender lines
for bonds.

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.369
Prof: The lines for the
bonds.

00:46:18.369 --> 00:46:21.489
They are thinner in the back
and notice that some of them are

00:46:21.489 --> 00:46:24.090
wedges, showing that they are
coming in and out.

00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:26.079
Anything else?
 

00:46:26.079 --> 00:46:27.139
Corey?
 

00:46:27.139 --> 00:46:30.103
Student:  Some things
are in the front and some in the

00:46:30.103 --> 00:46:30.449
back.
 

00:46:30.449 --> 00:46:32.088
Prof: How do you know
whether they are in the front or

00:46:32.088 --> 00:46:32.389
the back?
 

00:46:32.389 --> 00:46:37.099
Student: 
&gt;

00:46:37.099 --> 00:46:40.081
Prof: Like this one
Prof: How do you know

00:46:40.081 --> 00:46:40.960
it's in front of this one?
 

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.349
Student:  You can't see
part of it.

00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:44.159
Prof: Because it hides
it, right?

00:46:44.159 --> 00:46:46.239
That's a way you can tell.
 

00:46:46.239 --> 00:46:48.699
There's another one,
which is if you look at this

00:46:48.699 --> 00:46:51.619
one with the left eye and that
one with the right eye,

00:46:51.619 --> 00:46:54.670
your brain is able to put it
together in three dimensions.

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:55.880
It will be hard for you to do.
 

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:59.351
I don't expect you to;
you usually use glasses to do

00:46:59.351 --> 00:47:00.099
that, ok.
 

00:47:00.099 --> 00:47:01.429
But you can see that they are
different.

00:47:01.429 --> 00:47:03.199
Look at this hydrogen here.
 

00:47:03.199 --> 00:47:06.943
There you see the bond and
there it's being a little bit

00:47:06.943 --> 00:47:08.170
obscured, right?
 

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:12.155
So, there are different images
that your left and right eye see

00:47:12.155 --> 00:47:15.820
which is why Tenniel might have
had trouble with the third

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:16.719
dimension.
 

00:47:16.719 --> 00:47:24.190
Now, there's another way,
which is motion.

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:26.768
So, here's a complicated
picture, right?

00:47:26.768 --> 00:47:28.889
It's hard to tell what's in and
out.

00:47:28.889 --> 00:47:31.858
But if I grab it,
and do this,

00:47:31.858 --> 00:47:36.565
then you can perceive what's in
and what's out,

00:47:36.565 --> 00:47:37.590
right?
 

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:40.284
So, if you have a picture that
moves, which didn't used to be

00:47:40.284 --> 00:47:42.442
possible, of course,
until you had computers that

00:47:42.442 --> 00:47:43.789
can do this kind of thing.
 

00:47:43.789 --> 00:47:51.019
So, that's another way –
motion.

00:47:51.019 --> 00:47:52.889
There's that same molecule.
 

00:47:52.889 --> 00:47:54.789
There're other ways.
 

00:47:54.789 --> 00:47:58.130
What's new in this one?
 

00:47:58.130 --> 00:48:00.070
Shadows.
 

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:02.460
Or here.
 

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:05.860
More obscuring and shadowing of
the balls.

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:08.715
Or here, even better,
right, depending on what you

00:48:08.715 --> 00:48:09.590
want to show.
 

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:13.918
So, there are lots of
conventions or tricks that are

00:48:13.918 --> 00:48:17.059
used to convey the third
dimension.

00:48:17.059 --> 00:48:21.806
Ok, and next time we'll go on
to simple notation that you can

00:48:21.806 --> 00:48:25.050
write on an exam,
like showing tetrahedral

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:26.000
carbons.

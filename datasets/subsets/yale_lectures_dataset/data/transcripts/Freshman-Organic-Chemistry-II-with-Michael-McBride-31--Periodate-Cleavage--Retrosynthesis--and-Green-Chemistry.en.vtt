00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:03.233
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: So We've
been talking about 

00:00:03.233 --> 00:00:05.500
oxidation and reduction. 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.533
And today we're going to talk
about a very special kind of 

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:12.700
oxidation by iodic acid. 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.867
Periodate, that is to say. 

00:00:15.867 --> 00:00:18.467
Periodate cleavage of diols. 

00:00:18.467 --> 00:00:21.633
Carbonyl with an alcohol, then.
Let's try that. 

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:23.300
Carbonyl with two alcohol
molecules. 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.267
STUDENT: The chromium, which is
double-bonded with the 

00:00:26.267 --> 00:00:27.867
oxygens, and then-- 

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:28.933
PROFESSOR: Don't think about the
chromium. 

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:33.200
Just for the terms of the
analog, suppose that was a 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.067
carbonyl group. 

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.833
Instead of I=O, suppose it was
C=O 

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:38.533
What reaction do you get? 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.633
STUDENT: Is it a esterification?

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:47.067
PROFESSOR: Not esterification. 

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:49.033
You could imagine esterification
of an 

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:50.200
acid with an ester[correction:
alcohol]. 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.533
But I said not...Suppose it's
not a-- 

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:56.167
suppose it were a carbonyl
group, C=O. No OH 

00:00:56.167 --> 00:00:58.600
on the group up at top. 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.933
What reaction do you get between
a ketone-- 

00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:03.000
yeah, Matt? 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.033
STUDENT: Form a ketal. 

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:04.533
PROFESSOR: A ketale, right? 

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.600
So you get a reaction that's
just like that. 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.333
A ketale forms. And now we have
a thing that's a little 

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:17.767
bit like ozone, because this
sort of ketale can unzip. 

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:19.600
That's what reminds you a little
bit of ozone, 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.067
that kind of thing. 

00:01:22.067 --> 00:01:25.033
So it can come apart that way. 

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:29.200
And notice what's happened is
that the diol has become two 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.300
carbonyls, and of course that's
an oxidation. 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.333
The iodine started in oxidation
state +7, right, 

00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:39.333
seven bonds to oxygen, and it
ended in +5. 

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:42.933
So the iodine is reduced, and at
the same time, the carbon 

00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:44.167
is oxidized. 

00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:49.333
It's +1 here and it's +2 over
here. 

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:53.233
And two of them get oxidized.
Two carbons get oxidized. 

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:57.333
Now, this might remind you of
this reaction, where you get 

00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:58.000
two carbonyls. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.233
And what reaction is that? 

00:02:01.233 --> 00:02:03.300
What reagent will do that? 

00:02:04.233 --> 00:02:06.733
STUDENT: Is that ozone? 

00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:09.433
PROFESSOR: That's ozone, right?

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:10.933
What reagent does it? 

00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:11.733
Ozone. 

00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:14.800
So it's nice to think about,
when you have a certain 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.833
functional group you want to
get, what reaction 

00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:17.567
will lead to it. 

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:19.233
So there's one that will lead to
that. 

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:22.400
We could also think, what
reaction would come back from 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.267
two ketones to give a diol with
a 

00:02:25.267 --> 00:02:27.467
carbon-carbon bond in between? 

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:29.133
That's a more exotic reaction. 

00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:32.467
Does anybody remember that one?

00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:36.600
That's the pinacol reduction
that we talked about, where 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.533
metals give electrons to the
ketones, the radicals couple, 

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:42.867
and then you have 
two O's that get 

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:44.033
hydrogens on them. 

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:46.600
So that's the pinocol reduction
that we mentioned. 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.900
And then you might wonder if
there's a reaction that does 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.933
that, right? 

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:54.000
And we'll see an indirect
version of that 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.267
later in this lecture. 

00:02:56.267 --> 00:03:02.633
That involves the Wittig
reaction, which is familiar to 

00:03:02.633 --> 00:03:04.100
you from lab. 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.667
So periodic acid, cleavage of
carbohydrates, is 

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:08.833
a diagnostic tool. 

00:03:08.833 --> 00:03:10.767
This is a useful reaction. 

00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:12.933
It's actually used to prepare
compounds. 

00:03:12.933 --> 00:03:16.533
But it also was historically
important in finding out the 

00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:20.367
ring size of sugars that we
talked about 

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.200
earlier as a problem. 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.533
Remember, nowadays you do that
kind of thing by NMR, but in 

00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:28.067
the early days, you had to do
chemical transformations to 

00:03:28.067 --> 00:03:32.200
known compounds in order to
figure out what something was. 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.067
So if you have a diol, as we
just showed, you could react 

00:03:35.067 --> 00:03:39.033
it with periodic acid and get
two aldehydes. 

00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:42.867
In particular for this one,
formaldehyde. 

00:03:42.867 --> 00:03:45.433
So remember what sugars are, are
a bunch of 

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:46.333
carbons in a row. 

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:47.767
They're carbohydrates. 

00:03:47.767 --> 00:03:52.067
So it's carbon-hydrate, OHH, and
then the carbons link 

00:03:52.067 --> 00:03:56.000
together, and one end is CH2OH,
typically, and the 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.033
other end is an aldehyde. 

00:03:58.033 --> 00:03:59.500
Or the carbonyl could be other 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.800
positions down the chain. 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.367
But how do you figure out what
they are? 

00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:07.667
Suppose you had three in a row
and did periodic acid. 

00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:10.800
OK, so you react with one of
them, and get the formaldehyde 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.133
out from the end. 

00:04:12.133 --> 00:04:14.333
But from the bottom part there,
you get another 

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:16.833
aldehyde and OH. 

00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:21.267
And that reacts again with
periodic acid. 

00:04:21.267 --> 00:04:23.167
Now, why? 

00:04:23.167 --> 00:04:27.800
Because remember, the aldehydes
form hydrates, so 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.633
they're equivalent in 
water to alcohols. 

00:04:31.633 --> 00:04:36.700
So now we have a diol again, and
periodic acid oxidizes and 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.300
cleaves such diols. 

00:04:41.367 --> 00:04:43.533
So from this reaction, then, you
get two 

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.367
formaldehyde molecules. 

00:04:45.367 --> 00:04:48.100
And the one in the middle, which
had only one hydrogen on 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.733
the carbon, gives formic acid,
So formaldehyde arises from 

00:04:53.733 --> 00:04:56.967
the primary alcohols at the end
of the chain, and formic 

00:04:56.967 --> 00:04:59.633
acid from the ones in the middle
of the chain, that have 

00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:01.033
just an H on them. 

00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:03.900
And incidentally, I've taken
these slides from lectures 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.533
given in the course last year by
Professor Ziegler, because 

00:05:06.533 --> 00:05:08.467
he had nicely animated them
already. 

00:05:10.967 --> 00:05:13.700
So here's that reaction we just
talked about. 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.033
Now, suppose we had an aldehyde
at the end of the 

00:05:16.033 --> 00:05:18.833
chain and we did this. 

00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:22.900
Now the one...not only the one
in the middle of the chain has 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.500
only one H on it, but the one at
the top has only one H. 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.033
So from that one, you'd get a
formaldehyde and two formic 

00:05:30.033 --> 00:05:31.733
acids, right? 

00:05:31.733 --> 00:05:34.667
Or if the carbonyl were in the
middle of the chain, 

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:40.700
you're going to get formaldehyde
and the acid in 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.733
the middle. 

00:05:41.733 --> 00:05:46.933
But that acid in the middle
itself can hydrate and be 

00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:49.333
oxidized and give CO2. 

00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:53.233
So from this one, we get two
aldehydes, two formaldehydes, 

00:05:53.233 --> 00:05:55.700
and a CO2 molecule. 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.767
So now we could go down and see
what groups where that R 

00:05:58.767 --> 00:06:02.800
includes an adjacent H, right,
and what products 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.533
you'd get from them. 

00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:07.100
Formaldehyde, formic acid, and
carbon dioxide. 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.933
So that just summarizes what we
just looked at. 

00:06:09.933 --> 00:06:11.633
Now suppose you had glucose. 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.600
Now, the top would give formic
acid, the next one would be 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.900
formic acid, formic acid, formic
acid, formic acid. 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.633
The bottom would be
formaldehyde, because there 

00:06:21.633 --> 00:06:23.800
were two Hs on it. 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.400
If you had mannitol, a reduced
form related to glucose, then 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.367
the top would be formaldehyde,
two Hs, then acid, acid, acid, 

00:06:32.367 --> 00:06:35.267
acid, and at the bottom would be
formaldehyde. 

00:06:35.267 --> 00:06:38.567
So you see, the ratio of these
various well-known products 

00:06:38.567 --> 00:06:41.500
you get out tell you something
about what the structure of 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.300
the sugar was. 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.667
Or if you had fructose, which
has a ketone in it, you get 

00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:49.933
formaldehyde from the top, CO2
now from the one that has no 

00:06:49.933 --> 00:06:50.800
hydrogens at all. 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.567
Acid, acid, acid, formaldehyde.

00:06:54.567 --> 00:06:58.067
And you can also apply it to the
question of the ketals 

00:06:58.067 --> 00:07:00.267
that are formed when you form a
ring. 

00:07:00.267 --> 00:07:03.500
So remember, we spoke before
about this ketal being a 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.833
protecting group. 

00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:08.300
Both for the aldehyde that was
formerly here-- 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.933
and that's its oxygen-- 

00:07:09.933 --> 00:07:12.867
and for the alcohol that was
here. 

00:07:12.867 --> 00:07:13.767
OK? 

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:15.900
Now, we talked about the problem
with 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.167
determining the ring size. 

00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:19.933
Think what would happen with
this with HIO4. 

00:07:19.933 --> 00:07:22.233
So it would cleave those two
bonds where there 

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:24.533
are adjacent OHs. 

00:07:24.533 --> 00:07:24.833
Right? 

00:07:24.833 --> 00:07:26.033
Vicinal. 

00:07:26.033 --> 00:07:28.933
Those are the only places where
there are adjacent OHs. 

00:07:28.933 --> 00:07:31.367
So it would give formic acid--
there was one H on 

00:07:31.367 --> 00:07:32.300
that central carbon-- 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.400
and aldehydes on the end. 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.133
And now if you treated that with
acid and heat, then you'd 

00:07:39.133 --> 00:07:42.033
open up the ketal, right? 

00:07:42.033 --> 00:07:43.733
Ketals could be opened by acid.

00:07:43.733 --> 00:07:47.600
Incidentally, people don't
typically notice the necessity 

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.067
for heat in this, but it must
require heat. 

00:07:51.067 --> 00:07:54.833
Because if you can get that
product, which hasn't opened 

00:07:54.833 --> 00:07:57.667
the ketal in the first reaction,
which is done at 

00:07:57.667 --> 00:08:00.333
room temperature for a day,
periodic 

00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:03.467
acid is a strong acid. 

00:08:03.467 --> 00:08:04.867
So here's water-- 

00:08:04.867 --> 00:08:05.933
and it's done in water. 

00:08:05.933 --> 00:08:07.900
So it's water with an acid
catalyst. 

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.767
You'd think it would take the
ketal apart. 

00:08:10.767 --> 00:08:14.533
But in fact taking the ketal
apart requires some heat. 

00:08:14.533 --> 00:08:16.900
So that's done in the second
step. 

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.333
And then you get the aldehyde
taken apart. 

00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:23.367
So the pieces you get are-- 

00:08:23.367 --> 00:08:29.933
from the piece up here, you get
OH, OH, and aldehyde. 

00:08:29.933 --> 00:08:32.667
So you get D-glyceraldehyde. 

00:08:32.667 --> 00:08:35.700
From the piece over here you get
aldehyde 

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.700
and aldehyde again. 

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.700
And finally, of course, there's
methanol that came 

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:46.967
along, because it was a ketal
involving that alcohol. 

00:08:46.967 --> 00:08:49.533
So by telling what the products
are, you can tell 

00:08:49.533 --> 00:08:51.233
what the ring size was. 

00:08:51.233 --> 00:08:53.733
Now, here's a problem for you to
think about. 

00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:57.300
Suppose you could imagine these
ketals being formed with 

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.300
other-- instead of this OH being
the one that's involved 

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.300
to make a six-membered ring, it
could have been this OH and 

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.500
made a five-membered ring. 

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.667
Or in principle, this one that
made a four, or that one that 

00:09:08.667 --> 00:09:10.467
made a seven-membered ring. 

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:14.133
I'd like you to make a table
that shows what the products 

00:09:14.133 --> 00:09:17.533
would have been for periodic
oxidation of those others to 

00:09:17.533 --> 00:09:20.900
see whether, in fact, you could
prove what the ring size 

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.900
was by what products come out
from this. 

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:28.500
This reaction was developed in
1928 and 

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.100
applied for that purpose. 

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.767
That analytical purpose. 

00:09:32.767 --> 00:09:34.400
OK, so that's oxidation. 

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.567
Now we're going to talk about a
little bit of reduction, and 

00:09:37.567 --> 00:09:42.500
in particular, about
synthesizing alcohols and the 

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.100
idea of retrosynthesis a little
bit. 

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.067
Which is, you look at the
product-- usually it's a 

00:09:48.067 --> 00:09:51.433
product you want to have, and
you're trying to figure out 

00:09:51.433 --> 00:09:54.167
what starting materials and
reagents would have given it. 

00:09:54.167 --> 00:09:56.333
So really, you're working
backwards, rather than 

00:09:56.333 --> 00:09:58.067
forwards, in a synthesis. 

00:09:58.067 --> 00:10:01.533
So analyzing such problems is
called retrosynthesis, and 

00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:05.233
we'll engage in a little bit of
this here, using a problem 

00:10:05.233 --> 00:10:09.033
that occurs in the Jones
textbook. 

00:10:09.033 --> 00:10:09.367
OK. 

00:10:09.367 --> 00:10:11.200
So here's an alcohol we want to
get. 

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.700
We want to put R on an alcohol
that already has two methyls. 

00:10:18.267 --> 00:10:20.500
Now, we can start with acetone.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.000
There are the two methyls. 

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.800
And now we have to put the R on.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.667
Now, what kind of R do we need
in order to attack a carboile? 

00:10:27.667 --> 00:10:30.167
What will attack a carbonyl to
make a 

00:10:30.167 --> 00:10:31.867
carbon-carbon bond for R? 

00:10:31.867 --> 00:10:34.000
What form of R will we use? 

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.300
For example, could you use an
alkyl halide, RCl? 

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.467
Would that be something that
would react in order to give 

00:10:41.467 --> 00:10:44.067
this product? 

00:10:44.067 --> 00:10:46.900
What is it that will react with
a carbonyl? 

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.200
What makes a carbonyl 
reactive? Ruoyi?

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.900
STUDENT: You need a nucleophile.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:52.767
PROFESSOR: You need a
nucleophile. 

00:10:52.767 --> 00:10:56.067
So you need a carbon that has a
high HOMO on it. 

00:10:56.067 --> 00:10:58.333
Can you think of any such
things? 

00:10:58.333 --> 00:11:01.133
Where do you got a high HOMO on
a carbon? 

00:11:01.133 --> 00:11:02.133
STUDENT: From a Grignard. 

00:11:02.133 --> 00:11:05.100
PROFESSOR: From a Grignard
reaction, or an alkyl lithium. 

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.167
Something where R is attached to
a metal ion, 

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:10.533
so it'll be R minus. 

00:11:10.533 --> 00:11:10.867
OK. 

00:11:10.867 --> 00:11:15.267
So you have R with a metal, like
a Grignard reagent or an 

00:11:15.267 --> 00:11:17.167
alkyl lithium, right? 

00:11:17.167 --> 00:11:19.067
You do this reaction. 

00:11:19.067 --> 00:11:22.900
Then, of course, those electrons
could be used to 

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.300
form a bond to the metal, and
you get that intermediate. 

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:29.467
And in fact, as we've already
discussed, it's not so obvious 

00:11:29.467 --> 00:11:32.567
what the order of those
additions are, the R added to 

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:34.800
carbon and the metal added to
oxygen. 

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.567
It could be either first or in
fact probably 

00:11:37.567 --> 00:11:39.733
both at the same time. 

00:11:39.733 --> 00:11:43.100
So anyhow, we can make that new
carbon-carbon bond, and 

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.833
then treat the salt, the O minus
M plus, with H plus, and 

00:11:47.833 --> 00:11:48.867
get the alcohol. 

00:11:48.867 --> 00:11:51.367
So there's a simple synthesis. 

00:11:51.367 --> 00:11:55.200
Now, suppose we wanted to put an
H on instead of an R. What 

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.167
form of H do we need? 

00:11:57.167 --> 00:12:01.033
Can we do this with an acid, for
example, H plus? 

00:12:01.033 --> 00:12:03.533
Is that going to 
be a good idea? Megan?

00:12:03.533 --> 00:12:08.233
What type of the reagent, what
kind of H, 

00:12:08.233 --> 00:12:10.133
would attack a carbonyl? 

00:12:10.133 --> 00:12:12.000
What makes the carbonyl
reactive? 

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.767
STUDENT: The low LUMO 

00:12:13.767 --> 00:12:14.500
PROFESSOR: Low LUMO. 

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.133
So you need an H with a high
HOMO. 

00:12:16.133 --> 00:12:17.900
How about proton? 

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:18.867
STUDENT: Oh, no. 

00:12:18.867 --> 00:12:20.767
PROFESSOR: No, protons have no
electrons at all. 

00:12:20.767 --> 00:12:22.333
So what form of H do you need? 

00:12:22.333 --> 00:12:23.333
STUDENT: H minus. 

00:12:23.333 --> 00:12:24.033
PROFESSOR: H minus. 

00:12:24.033 --> 00:12:26.167
Where are you going to get H
minus? 

00:12:26.167 --> 00:12:27.967
Where did you get R minus? 

00:12:27.967 --> 00:12:30.233
STUDENT: From R-Metal. 

00:12:30.233 --> 00:12:30.833
PROFESSOR: R-metal. 

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:31.333
So what do we do now?  

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:32.533
STUDENT: H-Metal. 

00:12:32.533 --> 00:12:33.933
PROFESSOR: H-metal. 

00:12:33.933 --> 00:12:37.733
So this is going to be a hydride
reduction, OK? 

00:12:37.733 --> 00:12:40.433
So we have H with a metal, doing
exactly the same thing 

00:12:40.433 --> 00:12:42.967
we showed above, except it's H
minus instead of R 

00:12:42.967 --> 00:12:44.233
minus doing the trick. 

00:12:44.233 --> 00:12:47.600
And we get it from something
like H attached to aluminum 

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.267
with a minus charge on the
aluminum, which means it's 

00:12:50.267 --> 00:12:51.967
really going to be a high HOMO.

00:12:51.967 --> 00:12:55.533
Or H attached to boron with a
minus charge on it. 

00:12:55.533 --> 00:12:59.533
So those reagents are lithium
aluminum hydride, sodium 

00:12:59.533 --> 00:13:03.467
borohydride, which can reduce an
alcohol to 

00:13:03.467 --> 00:13:06.033
put the H on there. 

00:13:06.033 --> 00:13:09.033
And we also talked about the
biological equivalent of these 

00:13:09.033 --> 00:13:13.800
hydride donors, which is NADH,
where the unshared pair on the 

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.633
nitrogen can get into the, act
forming an aromatic system and 

00:13:17.633 --> 00:13:22.267
losing H minus, which can go
onto the carbonyl group. 

00:13:22.267 --> 00:13:26.700
So we have R minus or H minus as
ways to 

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.667
attack carbonyl groups. 

00:13:28.667 --> 00:13:31.500
Now let's look a little bit at
the synthetic versatility of 

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.067
Grignard reagents. 

00:13:33.067 --> 00:13:34.167
So here's a problem. 

00:13:34.167 --> 00:13:38.033
To suggest high yield syntheses
where the carbons 

00:13:38.033 --> 00:13:43.167
come only from alcohols with no
more than three carbons, 

00:13:43.167 --> 00:13:45.167
but you can use any other
reagent. 

00:13:45.167 --> 00:13:46.933
Now, these are very artificial.

00:13:46.933 --> 00:13:49.333
These are not a problem you'd be
faced with in the 

00:13:49.333 --> 00:13:52.767
laboratory, because many of
these you could buy. 

00:13:52.767 --> 00:13:55.367
Not all of them, but many of
them you could buy cheaper 

00:13:55.367 --> 00:13:56.933
than you could make them. 

00:13:56.933 --> 00:13:57.533
Right? 

00:13:57.533 --> 00:14:00.667
But in a way of thinking about
how you do syntheses in an 

00:14:00.667 --> 00:14:03.067
elementary way, this is a good
exercise. 

00:14:03.067 --> 00:14:08.267
And as I mentioned here, you can
find that problem in the 

00:14:08.267 --> 00:14:10.000
Jones textbook. 

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.233
So let's think first about the
first molecule in this list. 

00:14:14.233 --> 00:14:18.267
Now, what problem do we face in
making this from alcohols with 

00:14:18.267 --> 00:14:20.533
no more than three carbons? 

00:14:20.533 --> 00:14:22.300
There are four carbons in it. 

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.200
So we've got to make a
carbon-carbon bond somehow. 

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.633
So let's think about what
carbon-carbon 

00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:28.667
bonds we might make. 

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:31.233
We could make the first
carbon-carbon bond, nearest 

00:14:31.233 --> 00:14:34.167
the OH, or the next one, or the
next one. 

00:14:34.167 --> 00:14:35.433
There are three that we could
make. 

00:14:35.433 --> 00:14:38.233
And let's see how we would go
about that. 

00:14:38.233 --> 00:14:42.367
First let's try to make the one
adjacent to the H. So we 

00:14:42.367 --> 00:14:45.800
need to have two carbons that
will react with one another, 

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.633
one a high HOMO the other the
low LUMO, that will 

00:14:49.633 --> 00:14:52.133
establish that bond. 

00:14:52.133 --> 00:14:55.133
So we need a nucleophile, a high
HOMO, and an 

00:14:55.133 --> 00:14:57.033
electrophile, the low LUMO. 

00:14:57.033 --> 00:14:59.533
So what will the nucleophile be?

00:14:59.533 --> 00:15:00.833
Anybody got an idea? 

00:15:07.467 --> 00:15:09.467
It could be either the piece on
the left or the 

00:15:09.467 --> 00:15:10.700
piece on the right. 

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.833
If the electrophile were the
piece on the left, the three 

00:15:14.833 --> 00:15:20.267
carbon, what kind of molecule
would you do use? 

00:15:20.267 --> 00:15:23.900
If it were three carbons, and
you wanted it to be attacked 

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.100
by a high HOMO? 

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.833
STUDENT: R-Cl. 

00:15:28.833 --> 00:15:30.600
PROFESSOR: A halide would 
do it, right? 

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.700
The sigma* of an alkyl halide
would do that. 

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.567
Now suppose you wanted it to be
the high HOMO. 

00:15:37.567 --> 00:15:39.367
Then what would you do? 

00:15:39.367 --> 00:15:40.967
Megan, you just told us about
that. 

00:15:40.967 --> 00:15:43.333
Suppose you wanted R to be a
high HOMO. 

00:15:43.333 --> 00:15:44.233
STUDENT: A metal. 

00:15:44.233 --> 00:15:46.233
PROFESSOR: You'd use a metal, an
alkyl metal. 

00:15:46.233 --> 00:15:47.133
OK. 

00:15:47.133 --> 00:15:50.733
Now, how about the electrophile
on the right? 

00:15:50.733 --> 00:15:54.367
Here's a great example of use-
the-low-LUMO-of-carbonyl. 

00:15:54.367 --> 00:15:58.033
So now what we want on the left
is the high HOMO. 

00:15:58.033 --> 00:15:59.933
We want the alkyl metal. 

00:15:59.933 --> 00:16:02.733
But we can only start from
alcohols. 

00:16:02.733 --> 00:16:05.167
In fact, we can't even start
with this, because that's a 

00:16:05.167 --> 00:16:06.900
carbon that goes into the
product. 

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.967
We have to start from an
alcohol. 

00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:10.767
So how are we going to make that
from an alcohol? 

00:16:13.867 --> 00:16:15.500
How is it related to an alcohol?

00:16:18.733 --> 00:16:21.133
We can have a H on the carbon, H
on here. 

00:16:21.133 --> 00:16:23.167
That would be an alcohol
methanol. 

00:16:23.167 --> 00:16:25.900
What kind of reagent do we need
to get from 

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.167
the alcohol to this? 

00:16:30.167 --> 00:16:31.200
Is it an oxidation? 

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:31.933
Is it a reduction? 

00:16:31.933 --> 00:16:32.900
Is it neither? 

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.033
STUDENT: Oxidation. 

00:16:35.033 --> 00:16:36.933
PROFESSOR: We have to remove two
hydrogens. 

00:16:36.933 --> 00:16:38.800
It's an oxidation. 

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.600
There's a problem, though. 

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:46.133
Because the oxidizing agents
that oxidize alcohols also 

00:16:46.133 --> 00:16:47.500
react with aldehydes. 

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.767
If you have any water there,
water will add, make the 

00:16:50.767 --> 00:16:53.433
aldehyde into a diol, 

00:16:53.433 --> 00:16:54.733
and then that will react. 

00:16:54.733 --> 00:16:56.467
That will get oxidized by the
reagent. 

00:16:56.467 --> 00:16:58.000
How do you avoid that? 

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.200
We talked about this last time.
You don't have any water 

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.833
there, right? 

00:17:04.833 --> 00:17:06.267
So we talked about that last
time. 

00:17:06.267 --> 00:17:09.933
Pyridinium chlorochromate, done
in methylene chloride 

00:17:09.933 --> 00:17:12.667
solvent, so there's no water
there, you can do that trick. 

00:17:12.667 --> 00:17:13.800
So we have the electrophile. 

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.367
Now we need the nucleophile. 

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:18.533
We need a C3 group with a metal
on it. 

00:17:18.533 --> 00:17:21.100
But we can only start with an
alcohol. 

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:25.000
So if we had normal propyl
Grignard reagent, that would 

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.033
do the trick. 

00:17:26.033 --> 00:17:28.600
Where do you get a Grignard
reagent from? 

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.100
RMgBr. 

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.333
What's the starting material? 

00:17:35.267 --> 00:17:37.800
So you guys need to go through
this to get a little drill 

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.333
under your belts. 

00:17:40.333 --> 00:17:45.433
You get Grignard reagents from
alkyl halides. 

00:17:45.433 --> 00:17:52.667
So we could get RMgBr from
magnesium and alkyl bromide. 

00:17:52.667 --> 00:17:54.100
But where do we get the alkyl
bromide? 

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:59.000
Night The rules of the game has
us starting with alcohol. 

00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.667
Yea, Amy? 

00:17:59.667 --> 00:18:01.200
STUDENT: You can start with
PBr3. 

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.000
PROFESSOR: PBr3 on the alcohol.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.167
So we got it. 

00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:05.467
OK. 

00:18:05.467 --> 00:18:06.700
So we could make that first one.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.567
Now how about the second one? 

00:18:08.567 --> 00:18:12.533
Now we need an electrophile and
a nucleophile. 

00:18:12.533 --> 00:18:15.133
The electrophile, now on the
left, could be the 

00:18:15.133 --> 00:18:18.033
ethylmagnesium bromide, just two
carbons. 

00:18:18.033 --> 00:18:20.800
And we would make it the same
way here, starting with 

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.633
ethanol instead of propanol. 

00:18:22.633 --> 00:18:23.600
So that one's OK. 

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.667
Now, what will the group on the
right be? 

00:18:25.667 --> 00:18:30.233
We want to be able to attack
this carbon and end up with OH 

00:18:30.233 --> 00:18:31.500
on the adjacent carbon. 

00:18:35.067 --> 00:18:37.700
Now, you haven't done a lot of
problems like this, but you 

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:38.700
need to think them through 

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.300
and whatever textbook you're
using, you'll find 

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.433
problems of this sort. 

00:18:42.433 --> 00:18:43.767
So try some of them. 

00:18:43.767 --> 00:18:47.967
But we talked about such a
reaction, which is an epoxide. 

00:18:47.967 --> 00:18:48.300
Remember? 

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.467
The strained rings could be
attacked by a nucleophile to 

00:18:51.467 --> 00:18:56.867
open here to form this ring,
where you attack this carbon 

00:18:56.867 --> 00:18:59.733
and the O comes away as the
leaving group, protonated. 

00:18:59.733 --> 00:19:02.700
Now, where do we get that from?

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.233
Where does an epoxide come from?

00:19:04.233 --> 00:19:06.800
We have to start with an
alcohol. 

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.067
Any reactions that give
epoxides? 

00:19:11.367 --> 00:19:15.567
They come by adding oxygen to an
alkene. 

00:19:15.567 --> 00:19:19.133
Anybody remember the reagents
that'll add an oxygen? 

00:19:19.133 --> 00:19:22.000
STUDENT: Osmium? 

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:22.567
PROFESSOR: What?

00:19:22.567 --> 00:19:25.667
STUDENT: Osmium something,
tetrachloride? 

00:19:25.667 --> 00:19:26.600
PROFESSOR: Say again?

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.700
STUDENT: Osmium?

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:29.400
PROFESSOR: No. 

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:35.933
The osmium petroxide takes an
alkene and puts two Os on it. 

00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:37.100
That'll put two Os. 

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.200
We want to just put one O in the
middle. 

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.567
And you'll kick yourself when--

00:19:41.567 --> 00:19:42.367
oh yeah, Chris? 

00:19:42.367 --> 00:19:44.800
STUDENT: HOCl, I think you do it
with something else. 

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.933
PROFESSOR: You can add Cl and OH
and then remove HCl. 

00:19:48.933 --> 00:19:50.333
That was one way of doing it. 

00:19:50.333 --> 00:19:52.000
There's another way where you do
it in one step. 

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.800
STUDENT: mCPBA. 

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.000
PROFESSOR: mCPBA, 

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.067
meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. 

00:19:57.067 --> 00:20:00.600
Remember that cyclic butterfly
mechanism that transferred the 

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.800
oxygen from the peroxy acid? 

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.167
OK, so we got that. 

00:20:04.167 --> 00:20:06.867
But now we need the alkene, but
we only 

00:20:06.867 --> 00:20:08.667
have available alcohols. 

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:09.733
But that's a trivial one. 

00:20:09.733 --> 00:20:12.267
Just dehydrate[correction:
eliminate from] an alcohol, or

00:20:12.267 --> 00:20:15.167
dehydrate an alkyl bromide. 

00:20:15.167 --> 00:20:18.600
So you treat with strong base,
and remove HBr, 

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.467
and you got the thing. 

00:20:19.467 --> 00:20:19.733
OK. 

00:20:19.733 --> 00:20:20.533
So we've got that. 

00:20:20.533 --> 00:20:24.933
We can do that one with heat and
NaOH. 

00:20:24.933 --> 00:20:27.300
Now, how about the bottom one? 

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.733
That one is quite a problem. 

00:20:29.733 --> 00:20:34.500
The problem is that you could
have methyl Grignard, but what 

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.600
are you going to attack? 

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.600
Because if you had a
four-membered ring here with 

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.933
oxygen, it wouldn't open. 

00:20:39.933 --> 00:20:43.233
It's not strained like the
three-membered ring would be. 

00:20:43.233 --> 00:20:46.933
And if you try to make the
nucleophile be on the left, 

00:20:46.933 --> 00:20:50.533
that top right carbon being an
anion, and this one being, 

00:20:50.533 --> 00:20:52.767
say, formaldehyde, then 
you have the problem 

00:20:52.767 --> 00:20:56.233
that you'd get an OH here. 

00:20:56.233 --> 00:20:58.100
And that's a problem, because
you have to get rid of just 

00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.633
one of the two OHs. 

00:20:59.633 --> 00:21:04.200
Or you would have to have a
Grignard reagent, or something 

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.733
like here, and that would react
with its own H. 

00:21:06.733 --> 00:21:08.967
Now, you could imagine
complicated schemes where you 

00:21:08.967 --> 00:21:11.133
use protecting groups, and stuff
like that. 

00:21:11.133 --> 00:21:13.967
So it's conceivable, but it's
hard work. 

00:21:13.967 --> 00:21:17.700
because this is not a
particularly good carbon to be 

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.967
to be reactive. 

00:21:21.033 --> 00:21:24.100
So it's not in an activated
position. 

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.533
This one was in a position where
it could have been 

00:21:26.533 --> 00:21:28.133
attached to that oxygen. 

00:21:28.133 --> 00:21:30.600
This one was in a position that
was a carbonyl. 

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.233
But this one has no special
virtues that make it reactive, 

00:21:34.233 --> 00:21:37.567
so that one is the tough one to
make. 

00:21:37.567 --> 00:21:37.867
OK. 

00:21:37.867 --> 00:21:39.467
Now let's think about the second
one. 

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:45.633
Let's try to make that bond, for
example, right? 

00:21:45.633 --> 00:21:48.267
Now we need a nucleophile and an
electrophile. 

00:21:48.267 --> 00:21:51.633
Does anybody have an idea what
the low LUMO is that could be 

00:21:51.633 --> 00:21:55.900
attacked in order to make that
red bond? 

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.400
Yigit, you have an idea? 

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.833
We want to make this
carbon-carbon bond, and one of 

00:22:02.833 --> 00:22:06.133
the two carbons has to be a high
HOMO, and the other an 

00:22:06.133 --> 00:22:08.567
unusually low LUMO. 

00:22:08.567 --> 00:22:12.500
And notice, incidentally, that
this one that needs to be one 

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.400
of them has an oxygen next door.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.867
STUDENT: Yeah, that's carbon
double bond with O; pi*. 

00:22:16.867 --> 00:22:19.267
PROFESSOR: Carbon double bond
with O, right? 

00:22:19.267 --> 00:22:22.333
So then what would you use on
the right? 

00:22:22.333 --> 00:22:23.600
STUDENT: You need a nucleophile,
so, 

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.000
RCl. 

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
PROFESSOR: RCl is like R plus,
right? 

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.167
You want R minus. 

00:22:33.167 --> 00:22:35.400
You want a high HOMO, not the
low LUMO. 

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.100
Not sigma*. 

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:36.800
And what would you use? 

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.467
STUDENT: R-Metal. 

00:22:37.467 --> 00:22:38.667
PROFESSOR: It's a metal, right.

00:22:38.667 --> 00:22:38.967
OK. 

00:22:38.967 --> 00:22:40.600
So we need a nucleophile and an
electrophile. 

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.533
We use the three carbons on the
right 

00:22:43.533 --> 00:22:45.500
as a Grignard reagent. 

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:49.400
And now we need that aldehyde,
right? 

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.000
That four-carbon aldehyde. 

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.867
We can only start with three
carbon things, so we can't 

00:22:53.867 --> 00:22:56.200
oxidize one of the things they
give us, 

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.033
and make that aldehyde. 

00:22:58.033 --> 00:23:00.767
How are we going to make that
four carbon aldehyde? 

00:23:00.767 --> 00:23:03.333
Any ideas? 

00:23:03.333 --> 00:23:06.300
You don't have to look far. 

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.167
Linda do you have an idea? 

00:23:09.167 --> 00:23:13.267
You need four carbons that
terminate in oxygen, double 

00:23:13.267 --> 00:23:17.200
bond O. And you can only start
with three carbons. 

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.567
Can you think of any way of
making four carbons when you 

00:23:19.567 --> 00:23:24.367
start with three or less? 

00:23:24.367 --> 00:23:28.300
That was the first problem,
right? 

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.833
So you've already made this. 

00:23:29.833 --> 00:23:31.433
Can you think of any way of
making the aldehyde? 

00:23:36.167 --> 00:23:38.333
How do you go from the alcohol
to the aldehyde? 

00:23:38.333 --> 00:23:40.900
What do you need to do? 

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.433
You need to remove two Hs. 

00:23:43.433 --> 00:23:44.333
Right? 

00:23:44.333 --> 00:23:46.333
It's an oxidation reaction. 

00:23:46.333 --> 00:23:48.767
So think only of oxidizing
agents. 

00:23:48.767 --> 00:23:51.233
Can you think of any oxidizing
agent that the changes an 

00:23:51.233 --> 00:23:54.733
alcohol to an aldehyde? 

00:23:54.733 --> 00:23:57.767
STUDENT: [very quietly]PCC. 

00:23:57.767 --> 00:23:58.600
PROFESSOR: Sebastian? 

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.867
STUDENT: Br2. 

00:24:00.867 --> 00:24:02.833
PROFESSOR: Br2 can do it. 

00:24:02.833 --> 00:24:05.100
But you're going to have
problems, depending on how you 

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.400
do it, of over oxidation. 

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.233
The aldehydes can 
go on to acids. 

00:24:09.233 --> 00:24:10.167
STUDENT: PCC. 

00:24:10.167 --> 00:24:12.533
PROFESSOR: PCC, the same one we
used on the last slide. 

00:24:12.533 --> 00:24:16.033
So you treat that one as PCC in
the 

00:24:16.033 --> 00:24:17.267
methylene chloride solvent. 

00:24:17.267 --> 00:24:17.900
You got that aldehyde. 

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.433
So we've solved the second one.

00:24:20.433 --> 00:24:22.733
PCC and methylene chloride. 

00:24:22.733 --> 00:24:25.100
Now, the next one that they
suggest you try to 

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.567
make is this one. 

00:24:27.567 --> 00:24:30.233
Suppose you wanted to make that
bond. 

00:24:30.233 --> 00:24:33.433
Can you think of any way of
doing it? 

00:24:33.433 --> 00:24:36.233
Ellen? 

00:24:36.233 --> 00:24:37.533
What's going to be the
nucleophile? 

00:24:43.733 --> 00:24:45.167
STUDENT: the R-Metal. 

00:24:45.167 --> 00:24:45.633
PROFESSOR: Yeah. 

00:24:45.633 --> 00:24:47.300
What's the R going to be? 

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.600
Is it on the right or the left,
the one we're going to-- 

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:55.267
that's going to be the R-Metal
that we're going to deal with? 

00:24:55.267 --> 00:24:57.800
Is it going to be this carbon or
this carbon? 

00:25:00.633 --> 00:25:02.233
The bottom-right or the top-left
carbon? 

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.100
What's the top-left carbon going
to be in order 

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:09.933
to make that bond? 

00:25:09.933 --> 00:25:10.833
Amy? 

00:25:10.833 --> 00:25:13.933
STUDENT: It'll be another C=O. 

00:25:13.933 --> 00:25:16.667
PROFESSOR: C=O. When we see the
O next to the 

00:25:16.667 --> 00:25:18.200
carbon, we think aldehyde. 

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.933
That's going to be the LUMO that
gets attacked. 

00:25:20.933 --> 00:25:22.333
And the HOMO? Ellen?

00:25:22.333 --> 00:25:23.567
STUDENT: The one on the right. 

00:25:23.567 --> 00:25:25.067
PROFESSOR: The one on the right
is going to be a Grignard. 

00:25:25.067 --> 00:25:27.867
But this time, instead of
n-propyl, it's isopropyl. 

00:25:27.867 --> 00:25:29.500
And this is the aldehyde we
need. 

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.500
Any way of getting 
that aldehyde Ellen? 

00:25:33.667 --> 00:25:35.200
STUDENT: Yeah, it's the 
same one. 

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.767
PROFESSOR: It's the same one
above. 

00:25:36.767 --> 00:25:38.467
So we got that one. 

00:25:38.467 --> 00:25:38.800
OK. 

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.233
Now how about this one? 

00:25:40.233 --> 00:25:43.667
Any ideas for that? 

00:25:43.667 --> 00:25:45.233
So let's make that bond. 

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.200
So what gets attacked 
on the left? 

00:25:54.333 --> 00:25:56.433
Amy you want to help us again? 

00:25:56.433 --> 00:25:59.000
STUDENT: Well, it would
be...isn't it the to...

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.267
or the second one? 

00:26:00.267 --> 00:26:02.733
PROFESSOR: How many carbons on
the left? 

00:26:02.733 --> 00:26:05.933
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven. 

00:26:05.933 --> 00:26:08.033
We can only start with three
carbon alcohols. 

00:26:08.033 --> 00:26:12.600
STUDENT: Could you make the
second product and then there's

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.200
some kind of shift? 

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:13.533
PROFESSOR: Ah. 

00:26:13.533 --> 00:26:17.200
But the second product has the
seven with an 

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.533
alcohol in the middle. 

00:26:18.533 --> 00:26:19.667
So what do you do? 

00:26:19.667 --> 00:26:21.033
You need a ketone in the middle.

00:26:24.133 --> 00:26:25.200
You've made the alcohol. 

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.433
You need the ketone. 

00:26:28.733 --> 00:26:30.200
So you have to oxidize it. 

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.033
So you could use the same
reagent again, but you don't 

00:26:33.033 --> 00:26:35.367
need to worry, because it's a
ketone this time, so you're 

00:26:35.367 --> 00:26:37.333
not so worried about
overoxidation, so you could 

00:26:37.333 --> 00:26:39.600
use one of those chromate things
that we talked about, 

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.367
or bromine, or anything. 

00:26:42.367 --> 00:26:44.600
And on the right, it's just the
n-propyl again. 

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.433
We've already made that. 

00:26:46.433 --> 00:26:46.733
OK. 

00:26:46.733 --> 00:26:48.433
So we got that one made. 

00:26:48.433 --> 00:26:50.700
What if we wanted to make the
next bond, the 

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.933
vertical bond, instead? 

00:26:54.467 --> 00:26:54.667
Oh. 

00:26:54.667 --> 00:26:55.500
I didn't show it here. 

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.700
Well, what if we needed to make
the vertical bond? 

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.133
It's the same thing. 

00:27:00.133 --> 00:27:00.400
Right? 

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.233
The thing is symmetrical. 

00:27:01.233 --> 00:27:04.000
It has three propyl groups on
there. 

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:04.300
OK. 

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.067
So here's another one. 

00:27:05.067 --> 00:27:07.133
How are we going to make this
one? 

00:27:07.133 --> 00:27:10.133
Well, we could make that bond. 

00:27:10.133 --> 00:27:12.767
Anybody see how to do that? 

00:27:12.767 --> 00:27:17.900
Mary? What are we going to use
on the right? 

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:22.200
STUDENT: We're going to use the
same reagents. 

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.033
PROFESSOR: The same one as here,
isopropyl. 

00:27:24.033 --> 00:27:24.367
OK. 

00:27:24.367 --> 00:27:25.833
And what's on the left? 

00:27:25.833 --> 00:27:30.200
STUDENT: We're going to oxidize
the oxygen... 

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:30.433
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:27:30.433 --> 00:27:31.567
It's going to be the 
same one as above... 

00:27:31.567 --> 00:27:32.900
STUDENT: Yeah, and then we're
going to add isopropyl. 

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:33.800
PROFESSOR: that seven-carbon. 

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.167
So we've got that one. 

00:27:35.167 --> 00:27:38.500
And now finally, how about if we
wanted to 

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.033
make that one instead? 

00:27:41.033 --> 00:27:44.233
Then what would the Grignard
reagent be? 

00:27:44.233 --> 00:27:45.900
It would be n-propyl instead of
isopropyl. 

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.633
And what would the ketone be? 

00:27:48.633 --> 00:27:49.533
It would be this. 

00:27:49.533 --> 00:27:52.367
And where would we get that? 

00:27:52.367 --> 00:27:53.833
By oxidizing this one. 

00:27:56.367 --> 00:27:57.400
And finally this one. 

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:01.000
Now, we could imagine making
this bond, or making this 

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.900
bond, or making this bond. 

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.867
And we have the means to do all
these things now. 

00:28:06.867 --> 00:28:10.667
But one wonders, is there a
preferred order? 

00:28:10.667 --> 00:28:14.133
Is one way of doing this better
than the others? 

00:28:14.133 --> 00:28:17.067
And in this case, I suspect that
they're 

00:28:17.067 --> 00:28:20.600
all about the same. 

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.333
It might come down to what's
cheap and available and so on, 

00:28:24.333 --> 00:28:26.800
which alcohols are cheaper. 

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.500
And in fact, of course, you
would never do this, because 

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.900
simple things like this, you
wouldn't start from the 

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.333
alcohol, you'd buy the bromide
or something like that. 

00:28:35.333 --> 00:28:37.933
But when you talk about
versatility of Grignard 

00:28:37.933 --> 00:28:40.133
reagents, there are other things
they can do, too. 

00:28:40.133 --> 00:28:44.633
For example, if you try to make
the diisopropyl methyl 

00:28:44.633 --> 00:28:49.900
version of the carbinol here to
make this one, you find 

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:54.667
that you can first make the
salt, then treat it with acid, 

00:28:54.667 --> 00:28:57.733
you get that alcohol, and it's
95% yield. 

00:28:57.733 --> 00:28:59.600
Great. 

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:03.167
Now, suppose you want to use
t-butyl instead of methyl. 

00:29:03.167 --> 00:29:03.767
Right? 

00:29:03.767 --> 00:29:05.367
So you want to get that one. 

00:29:05.367 --> 00:29:10.300
So you try that reaction, and
you get 0% yield of that. 

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.933
The product is this. 

00:29:12.933 --> 00:29:17.167
So what was it that added to the
carbonyl? 

00:29:17.167 --> 00:29:19.667
It wasn't the t-butyl anion. 

00:29:19.667 --> 00:29:23.167
What anion was it? 

00:29:23.167 --> 00:29:26.033
What did the addition? 

00:29:26.033 --> 00:29:28.300
It was hydride. 

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:32.867
But where did the hydride come
from? 

00:29:32.867 --> 00:29:35.400
So it was a reduction by H
minus, or the 

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.300
equivalent of H minus. 

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.067
What you had was the t-butyl
Grignard. 

00:29:41.067 --> 00:29:44.367
Now, what problem did t-butyl
Grignard have in trying to 

00:29:44.367 --> 00:29:48.233
form this alcohol? Yeah Cassie?

00:29:48.233 --> 00:29:49.067
STUDENT: It's sterically
hindered. 

00:29:49.067 --> 00:29:50.100
PROFESSOR: It's sterically
hindered. 

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.600
The carbon can't get close to
the carbon. 

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.433
But a hydrogen can get close to
the carbon. 

00:29:55.433 --> 00:29:58.533
That beta hydrogen can get close
to the carbon. 

00:29:58.533 --> 00:29:59.967
So now we can do this. 

00:30:02.733 --> 00:30:08.300
And you see that the carbon part
that was t-butyl loses 

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:13.067
magnesium and loses H to become
the alkene, and the 

00:30:13.067 --> 00:30:16.433
other product, then, is that 65%
yield alcohol. 

00:30:16.433 --> 00:30:18.933
And this reminds you, this
hydrogen transfer from 

00:30:18.933 --> 00:30:22.000
t-butyl, although it's happening
here in the context 

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.633
of an anion, it reminds you of
two t-butyl radicals having 

00:30:25.633 --> 00:30:27.700
trouble forming a carbon-carbon
bond and 

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:32.933
transferring a hydrogen atom
instead for the same reason, 

00:30:32.933 --> 00:30:35.333
to avoid steric hindrance. 

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:35.667
OK. 

00:30:35.667 --> 00:30:42.967
Now, if you use t-butyl CH2
magnesium bromide, then you 

00:30:42.967 --> 00:30:46.733
don't have to worry about this
hydride transfer. 

00:30:46.733 --> 00:30:51.933
Because it has CH2 in this
position, and three methyls 

00:30:51.933 --> 00:30:53.500
attached to that carbon. 

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.500
There is no hydrogen in the beta
position, so it looks 

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.633
like we're home free, here. 

00:30:58.633 --> 00:31:02.067
But you only get a 4% yield of
the Grignard, right? 

00:31:02.067 --> 00:31:04.267
Because it's still sterically
hindered. 

00:31:04.267 --> 00:31:13.400
What you get instead is
protonation of 

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:17.700
the neopentyl group. 

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:22.233
So remember that the ketone
itself has alpha hydrogens. 

00:31:22.233 --> 00:31:24.300
So you can form enolates, you
can give up 

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.867
a proton from those. 

00:31:25.867 --> 00:31:29.167
So this thing which is a
nuclophile is also a strong 

00:31:29.167 --> 00:31:34.833
base, and can take that off, and
you get that one plus the 

00:31:34.833 --> 00:31:36.533
enolate, which lost the proton.

00:31:36.533 --> 00:31:38.933
But then when you work it up
with acid, you protonate it 

00:31:38.933 --> 00:31:45.767
again, so the ketone gets
recovered, 90% of it, and your 

00:31:45.767 --> 00:31:48.967
carefully made Grignard reagent
just becomes the 

00:31:48.967 --> 00:31:49.900
hydrocarbon. 

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.333
No use there. 

00:31:52.333 --> 00:31:52.700
OK. 

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.367
So those are other things that
can happen 

00:31:54.367 --> 00:31:55.833
with Grignard reagents. 

00:31:55.833 --> 00:31:57.967
And that same thing,
incidentally, can happen here, 

00:31:57.967 --> 00:32:02.000
because the alpha hydrogen was
present here, and this one was 

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.067
a strong base, and in fact 35%
of that one was that plus the 

00:32:07.067 --> 00:32:12.167
starting ketone after you put
the proton back on. 

00:32:12.167 --> 00:32:22.500
Now, if you try to make this
bond, you could make it with-- 

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.233
notice the difference this time
is that it's isopropyl 

00:32:25.233 --> 00:32:27.633
instead of t-butyl group here. 

00:32:27.633 --> 00:32:28.933
So you could try doing this. 

00:32:31.567 --> 00:32:35.233
So that has an H beta and steric
hindrance, so there's 

00:32:35.233 --> 00:32:36.733
the risk that it would give
reduction. 

00:32:41.233 --> 00:32:45.700
But if you started with that
ketone and added methyl 

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:49.467
Grignard, then the methyl
doesn't have any hydrogen beta 

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:52.100
that it could give in reduction,
so now you get a 

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.800
good yield of the product that
you wanted. 

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.733
So sometimes it's helpful to
choose one of 

00:32:58.733 --> 00:32:59.667
the bonds to make. 

00:32:59.667 --> 00:33:03.533
So in trying to make this
alcohol, the thing you get 

00:33:03.533 --> 00:33:06.567
when you protonate here, you
could make this bond or this 

00:33:06.567 --> 00:33:07.567
bond or this bond. 

00:33:07.567 --> 00:33:10.500
But the bonds to methyl are much
more practical to make 

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.767
than the bond to the CH2 because

00:33:12.767 --> 00:33:15.500
of the risk of reduction. 

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:15.767
OK. 

00:33:15.767 --> 00:33:18.233
Now, the Wittig reaction we can
zoom through, because you 

00:33:18.233 --> 00:33:20.233
all know that from lab. 

00:33:20.233 --> 00:33:22.867
I don't remember what base you
used to 

00:33:22.867 --> 00:33:25.267
make the Wittig reagent. 

00:33:25.267 --> 00:33:26.933
Do you remember? 

00:33:26.933 --> 00:33:28.467
STUDENT: Sodium hydroxide. 

00:33:28.467 --> 00:33:29.533
PROFESSOR: Sodium what? 

00:33:29.533 --> 00:33:30.533
STUDENT: Hydroxide. 

00:33:30.533 --> 00:33:31.067
PROFESSOR: Hydroxide. 

00:33:31.067 --> 00:33:34.667
So you didn't have such a simple
Wittig 

00:33:34.667 --> 00:33:36.633
reagent as this one. 

00:33:36.633 --> 00:33:39.500
Notice that here you make the
reagent by reacting with 

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:43.433
bromide, just like nitrogen
would do-- an SN2 reaction. 

00:33:43.433 --> 00:33:46.533
Now you have that cation, and
you treat it, in this case, 

00:33:46.533 --> 00:33:48.233
with a very strong base. 

00:33:48.233 --> 00:33:49.900
Butyl lithium. 

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.467
So a carbon anion. 

00:33:51.467 --> 00:33:52.633
What's the pH[correction: pK3]
of a 

00:33:52.633 --> 00:33:54.300
carbon-hydrogen bond, typically?

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:57.067
Just like butane losing a
proton?

00:33:57.067 --> 00:33:58.333
STUDENT: 50. 

00:33:58.333 --> 00:33:59.600
PROFESSOR: Order of 50, right? 

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.067
Very weak acid. 

00:34:01.067 --> 00:34:04.767
So the butyl lithium is a very
strong base, and pulls that 

00:34:04.767 --> 00:34:06.767
proton off the CH2. 

00:34:06.767 --> 00:34:13.600
Now in this case, the pKa is
about 30 of the CH3 group to 

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.667
lose a proton. 

00:34:14.667 --> 00:34:18.467
You're never going to get that
off with hydroxide. 

00:34:18.467 --> 00:34:23.933
But you can do it in this case
with a stronger base. 

00:34:23.933 --> 00:34:26.867
But what is it that...you
couldn't do this if, instead 

00:34:26.867 --> 00:34:28.867
of phosphorus, you had nitrogen.

00:34:28.867 --> 00:34:31.600
Now, what's good about forming
this anion? 

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.533
Why is that anion a reasonable
one to try to make, where you 

00:34:34.533 --> 00:34:39.167
don't pull hydrogens off carbons
willy-nilly, not off 

00:34:39.167 --> 00:34:40.667
normal hydrocarbons? 

00:34:40.667 --> 00:34:43.167
What does the neighboring
phosphorus have to do with it? 

00:34:43.167 --> 00:34:45.633
How does it make it easy to form
the anion? 

00:34:45.633 --> 00:34:47.400
Well, the phosphorus is a
cation. 

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.900
It's easy to form an anion near
the cation. 

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.900
You could do that with nitrogen,
"It could have been

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.300
N plus, the next 

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.200
neighbor up in the periodic
table, right? 

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.067
But phosphorus is even better. 

00:35:00.067 --> 00:35:03.200
Because when you get that anion
to be stabilized, 

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.033
phosophorus, down in the next
row of the periodic table, has 

00:35:06.033 --> 00:35:08.267
vacant d-orbitals that are able
to 

00:35:08.267 --> 00:35:10.167
stabilize that electron. 

00:35:10.167 --> 00:35:13.633
So it's especially acidic, but
not so acidit that you're 

00:35:13.633 --> 00:35:16.333
going to pull it off with OH
minus. 

00:35:16.333 --> 00:35:18.333
So you could draw a resonance
structure where you have a 

00:35:18.333 --> 00:35:21.167
double bond, where not only the
phosphorus has given 

00:35:21.167 --> 00:35:26.367
electrons to the carbon in
making the bond, but the 

00:35:26.367 --> 00:35:28.933
carbon has given electrons back
to the phosphorus 

00:35:28.933 --> 00:35:32.033
through this d-orbital or
interaction. 

00:35:32.033 --> 00:35:35.900
Anyhow, you have this the
so-called ylide, and then it 

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:40.267
can act as a nucleophile with a
carbonyl, and now the 

00:35:40.267 --> 00:35:43.367
oxygen can add to the
phosphorus, which can form 

00:35:43.367 --> 00:35:46.500
five bonds, because it has extra
valence orbitals, these 

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.567
d-orbitals. 

00:35:48.567 --> 00:35:50.400
So you get the four-membered
ring. 

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:57.033
But that very easily unzips
because the PO double bond is 

00:35:57.033 --> 00:35:58.100
unusually stable. 

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:03.067
The NO bond of a trivalent
nitrogen that then adds 

00:36:03.067 --> 00:36:06.233
oxygen, is only seventy
kilocalories per mole, but the 

00:36:06.233 --> 00:36:09.733
phosphorus version is 100
kilocalories per mole, because 

00:36:09.733 --> 00:36:12.933
of those d-orbitals making it
especially stable. 

00:36:12.933 --> 00:36:13.300
OK. 

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:16.733
So you can get that
triphenylphosphene oxide and 

00:36:16.733 --> 00:36:20.267
the alkene, and as you know,
what the Wittig reaction 

00:36:20.267 --> 00:36:25.900
results in is replacing double
bond O by double bond CH2, or 

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.267
in other cases, double bond C
something else, depending on 

00:36:29.267 --> 00:36:32.633
what you started with up here. 

00:36:32.633 --> 00:36:34.533
And I say directly-- 

00:36:34.533 --> 00:36:36.900
because there are other ways of
going roundabout to do 

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.433
this, rather than to do it
directly. 

00:36:38.433 --> 00:36:41.833
For example, you could add a
methyl Grignard to this ketone 

00:36:41.833 --> 00:36:43.367
to make the alcohol. 

00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:47.100
Treat that with acid, lose the
water to make the primary 

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.833
cation, and it could then lose a
proton. 

00:36:49.833 --> 00:36:51.267
And that would replace-- 

00:36:51.267 --> 00:36:55.067
here's what our CH2 is coming
from, right? 

00:36:55.067 --> 00:36:57.967
And then we lose the H from the
CH3 to get that. 

00:36:57.967 --> 00:37:02.467
So that replaces the double bond
O with double bond CH2. 

00:37:02.467 --> 00:37:06.033
The same thing the Wittig
reaction would do, except 

00:37:06.033 --> 00:37:08.033
that's not the major product. 

00:37:08.033 --> 00:37:10.633
It's a minor product. 

00:37:10.633 --> 00:37:11.900
What's the other product? 

00:37:16.533 --> 00:37:20.433
The other product is losing a
different alpha hydrogen. 

00:37:20.433 --> 00:37:21.200
One of those. 

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.467
That's the major product. 

00:37:22.467 --> 00:37:23.433
Why? 

00:37:23.433 --> 00:37:28.333
It's a more stable alkene, more
highly substituted. 

00:37:28.333 --> 00:37:34.067
So you can see the advantage of
the Wittig reaction, which 

00:37:34.067 --> 00:37:37.667
directly gives the replacement
of double bond O by double 

00:37:37.667 --> 00:37:41.267
bond CH2, in this case, or
double bond CHR, 

00:37:41.267 --> 00:37:45.133
or double bond CR2. 

00:37:45.133 --> 00:37:48.033
Now, I was going to say a little
bit about green 

00:37:48.033 --> 00:37:50.667
chemistry in connection with
some of these reactions we're 

00:37:50.667 --> 00:37:51.933
talking about. 

00:37:51.933 --> 00:37:55.133
So pharmaceuticals are a big
chemical industry nowadays. 

00:37:55.133 --> 00:37:58.800
A hundred years ago, it would
still have been dye industry. 

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.733
And then petroleum,
pharmaceuticals, plastics. 

00:38:02.733 --> 00:38:07.900
But now, pharmaceuticals
generate only 0.2% of the 

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:12.433
chemical industry's product,
measured by mass, but 25% of 

00:38:12.433 --> 00:38:15.300
its value in money. 

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:19.900
Which means that it's worth
doing a lot of work on those 

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.933
to do a lot of reactions in
order to get these 

00:38:21.933 --> 00:38:22.800
pharmaceuticals. 

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.467
There's a lot of value added. 

00:38:25.467 --> 00:38:28.867
But in the process of doing all
these manipulations, the 

00:38:28.867 --> 00:38:32.067
pharmaceutical industry
generates more than 50% of the 

00:38:32.067 --> 00:38:35.133
chemical waste. 

00:38:35.133 --> 00:38:39.167
So the idea of green chemistry
is to find new ways of doing 

00:38:39.167 --> 00:38:42.367
things that won't generate so
much waste, or will be safer, 

00:38:42.367 --> 00:38:44.133
for example. 

00:38:44.133 --> 00:38:49.033
So there's a journal called
Green Chemistry, and in 2000, 

00:38:49.033 --> 00:38:52.267
they published a paper called
"Key Green Chemistry Research 

00:38:52.267 --> 00:38:55.667
Areas: A Perspective from
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers." 

00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:59.433
So representatives of the
biggest pharmaceutical 

00:38:59.433 --> 00:39:03.167
companies, AstraZeneca,
GlaxoSmithKline, Lilly, 

00:39:03.167 --> 00:39:04.900
Pfizer, Merck, Schering-Plough,
which is now 

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:09.433
part of Merck, got together to
talk about what they saw as 

00:39:09.433 --> 00:39:13.000
the places where you could make
advances to make 

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.967
chemistry more friendly to the
environment and to the people 

00:39:16.967 --> 00:39:20.233
practicing it. 

00:39:20.233 --> 00:39:25.400
And obviously from the
perspective of the 

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.900
pharmaceutical industry. 

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:32.333
So this is gazing in a crystal
ball, and there's nothing as 

00:39:32.333 --> 00:39:35.267
hard to predict as the future. 

00:39:35.267 --> 00:39:37.533
But at least these are their
ideas, and they're people that 

00:39:37.533 --> 00:39:40.333
have a great practical interest
in it, not only in 

00:39:40.333 --> 00:39:43.200
the sense of there are things
they want to happen, but they're

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.833
willing to give money to people
to try to 

00:39:45.833 --> 00:39:46.967
help make it happen, 

00:39:46.967 --> 00:39:49.433
to do research projects, to try
to develop new 

00:39:49.433 --> 00:39:50.300
ways of doing it. 

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.567
So they were trying to decide
what they would most like to 

00:39:52.567 --> 00:39:56.467
have. So it involves frequency
of use. 

00:39:56.467 --> 00:39:58.633
If there's a reaction you hardly
ever use, you don't 

00:39:58.633 --> 00:40:00.700
want to spend a lot of trouble
on that one. 

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.900
But if there's something that
you use all the time that you 

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.567
could make better, then that's
important. 

00:40:04.567 --> 00:40:05.967
So frequency of use. 

00:40:05.967 --> 00:40:08.667
How much volume is involved of
the stuff. 

00:40:08.667 --> 00:40:11.300
If it's only a milligram, who
cares? 

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.700
But if it's tons, that's a big
deal. 

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.233
And of course, safety is another
one. 

00:40:16.233 --> 00:40:19.467
So one of the top priorities is
solvents, because that's 

00:40:19.467 --> 00:40:22.333
what they use the most of. 

00:40:22.333 --> 00:40:25.533
And something that wouldn't
occur to the outsider, 

00:40:25.533 --> 00:40:29.200
probably, is a very important
thing is to clean the-- they 

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.700
have these big reaction vessels
and they have to clean 

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.100
them so that stuff that's left
over from the previous 

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:37.167
reaction doesn't get into some
other drug. 

00:40:37.167 --> 00:40:39.500
So they have to be scrupulously
cleaned. 

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:43.567
And two thirds of the solvent
they use is used in cleaning 

00:40:43.567 --> 00:40:46.267
the reactors to make sure that
they're clean. 

00:40:46.267 --> 00:40:47.867
But there might be other ways of
doing it. 

00:40:47.867 --> 00:40:51.900
For example, use water and an
oxidizing agent like hydrogen 

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.600
peroxide maybe to do it. 

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:57.600
So anyhow, they're interested in
that as one of the big 

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.667
steps they could take. 

00:40:58.667 --> 00:41:04.433
Or replacements for what are
called aprotic solvents. 

00:41:04.433 --> 00:41:06.067
So these are organic solvents. 

00:41:06.067 --> 00:41:08.233
They'll dissolve organic
compounds. 

00:41:08.233 --> 00:41:10.933
But they also typically dissolve
salt. 

00:41:10.933 --> 00:41:14.267
So you can have salts react with
organic compounds in 

00:41:14.267 --> 00:41:15.567
these solvents. 

00:41:15.567 --> 00:41:19.667
So ones like NMP there on the
left, N-Methylpyrrolidone or 

00:41:19.667 --> 00:41:22.567
dimethylacetamide, or
dimethylformamide are very 

00:41:22.567 --> 00:41:27.400
heavily used solvents, because
you can mix organic and salt 

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.433
reagents in them. 

00:41:29.433 --> 00:41:33.100
But the problem is that they're
very difficult--

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:35.267
because they're
miscible with water, 

00:41:35.267 --> 00:41:37.567
they're very hard to get out of
the water at 

00:41:37.567 --> 00:41:40.167
the end of the day. 

00:41:40.167 --> 00:41:43.933
They're worried about polluting
water streams. So 

00:41:43.933 --> 00:41:46.067
they would like to get
replacements for that. 

00:41:46.067 --> 00:41:47.367
Now, you could wish for
anything. 

00:41:47.367 --> 00:41:49.233
You could wish for $2 billion. 

00:41:49.233 --> 00:41:51.033
I'd like to have $2 billion now;

00:41:51.033 --> 00:41:52.967
I'm willing to split it with all
of you guys. 

00:41:52.967 --> 00:41:54.900
That doesn't mean it's going to
happen. 

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:56.967
And so you can see a real
problem with this. 

00:41:56.967 --> 00:41:59.700
The reason these solvents are
good is because they're 

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.133
organic and they're miscible
with water. 

00:42:02.133 --> 00:42:04.933
But the misciblity with water is
what makes them bad, 

00:42:04.933 --> 00:42:07.100
because it's hard to get out of
the water again. 

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:11.400
So I don't know what progress
has been made on this. 

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.033
But anyhow, it's something that
they would really like. 

00:42:14.033 --> 00:42:17.267
But then they thought of
thirteen processes, that is, 

00:42:17.267 --> 00:42:21.033
not just solvents but actual
reactions that need improving. 

00:42:21.033 --> 00:42:23.567
And the ones that they already
use heavily. 

00:42:23.567 --> 00:42:27.900
And fourteen, they suggested new
processes that there isn't 

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:31.033
a good way to do now, but would
really be handy if you 

00:42:31.033 --> 00:42:32.000
could do them. 

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.500
And then they voted. 

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:37.900
So there were six companies
represented doing the voting, 

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:42.233
and each of them could cast five
votes to choose among the 

00:42:42.233 --> 00:42:45.000
thirteen processes that need
improving, and another five 

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.033
votes among the fourteen
processes that they would like 

00:42:48.033 --> 00:42:49.233
to have available. 

00:42:49.233 --> 00:42:53.600
So this is the perspective from
the people who really do 

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.200
it about what would be useful to
do. 

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.367
So current processes that need
reviewing. 

00:42:58.367 --> 00:43:04.300
All six of them voted that a way
of forming amides, 

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:07.167
avoiding poor atom economy
reagents. 

00:43:07.167 --> 00:43:10.400
Now, what that means is you're
just trying to put this 

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.867
nitrogen onto a carboxylic acid
to make an amide. 

00:43:13.867 --> 00:43:16.833
But if you use other reagents
that have an enormous number 

00:43:16.833 --> 00:43:19.000
of atoms in it, then
necessarily, you're going to 

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.667
have an enormous amount of waste
generated. 

00:43:21.667 --> 00:43:25.067
But if you could do it with
atom-economy, so you have a 

00:43:25.067 --> 00:43:29.433
minimum number of atoms going
in, in order to-- 

00:43:29.433 --> 00:43:33.300
ideally would be just the
element you want to have added 

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.033
to the molecule, right? 

00:43:35.033 --> 00:43:38.267
For example, a catalyst might
allow you to do that, where a 

00:43:38.267 --> 00:43:40.967
stoichiometric reagent, where
you have to add a whole mole 

00:43:40.967 --> 00:43:43.133
of it, wouldn't do it. 

00:43:43.133 --> 00:43:47.200
So then OH activation for
nucleophilic substitution. 

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.867
This is something we've talked
about a lot. 

00:43:48.867 --> 00:43:51.967
You make the OH, you protonate
it, you make it into an acid 

00:43:51.967 --> 00:43:54.000
chloride, you make it into a
tosylate 

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.033
with the leaving group. 

00:43:55.033 --> 00:43:57.967
But this is something that five
of these industries still 

00:43:57.967 --> 00:44:00.767
say is one of the most important
things to develop. 

00:44:00.767 --> 00:44:03.367
A better way of 
activating OH for

00:44:03.367 --> 00:44:04.733
nucleus[correction:
nucleophilic] substitution. 

00:44:04.733 --> 00:44:07.433
Reduction of amides, the
carbonyl group in amides, 

00:44:07.433 --> 00:44:10.367
without using hydrides. 

00:44:10.367 --> 00:44:13.033
So they say, lithium aluminum
hydride, having a molecular 

00:44:13.033 --> 00:44:16.633
weight of 38 and four hydrides
per molecule, has the highest 

00:44:16.633 --> 00:44:17.833
hydride density. 

00:44:17.833 --> 00:44:22.733
So from the terms of
atom-economy, it's very good. 

00:44:22.733 --> 00:44:26.100
But it co-generates an inorganic
byproduct which is 

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:29.667
difficult to separate from the
product, and that makes the 

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:33.267
filtration slow, you lose
product when you're trying to 

00:44:33.267 --> 00:44:36.533
filter it, get absorbed in this
extra junk 

00:44:36.533 --> 00:44:37.933
that's being made. 

00:44:37.933 --> 00:44:40.067
So they need something better
than the 

00:44:40.067 --> 00:44:43.033
available hydride reagents. 

00:44:43.033 --> 00:44:47.267
Or to be able to do oxidation or
epoxidation without using a 

00:44:47.267 --> 00:44:48.467
chlorinated solvent. 

00:44:48.467 --> 00:44:51.100
Four of them said that was a top
priority. 

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:56.900
And they noticed, in connection
with the oxidation, 

00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:00.300
that using the kinds of metals,
like chromium or 

00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:04.133
osmium, that we've talked about,
or manganese, these 

00:45:04.133 --> 00:45:07.967
have virtually been eliminated
from pharmaceutical processes, 

00:45:07.967 --> 00:45:11.867
because small amounts of these
metals could be injurious to 

00:45:11.867 --> 00:45:12.567
the health. 

00:45:12.567 --> 00:45:16.233
So the FDA requires that there
be none in there. 

00:45:16.233 --> 00:45:20.400
So better is to use oxidizing
agents that don't involve such 

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:23.533
metals when you're making
pharmaceuticals. 

00:45:23.533 --> 00:45:23.933
OK. 

00:45:23.933 --> 00:45:26.733
Then safer and more
environmentally friendly 

00:45:26.733 --> 00:45:28.533
Mitsunobu reactions. 

00:45:28.533 --> 00:45:31.167
Now, we're going to talk about
the Mitsunobu reaction next. 

00:45:31.167 --> 00:45:33.000
But three said that was
important, so it's

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.233
worth knowing what the 

00:45:34.233 --> 00:45:37.867
Mitsunobu reaction is, if they
think it's so important. 

00:45:37.867 --> 00:45:41.933
Friedel-Crafts reactions on
unactivated systems. We talked 

00:45:41.933 --> 00:45:47.233
about substituents that were
activating or deactivating. 

00:45:47.233 --> 00:45:50.600
But there are not good ways,
they say, of doing their 

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.600
Friedel-Crafts reactions on
unactivated systems. At least 

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.000
two of them said that. 

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.833
And two of them said nitrations
was a problem, 

00:45:57.833 --> 00:46:00.400
not because the reaction's hard
to do, 

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:03.400
but because of the danger of
explosion with nitric acid.

00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:03.050
(solemn music)

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.290
- Okay, greetings everybody.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.480
Welcome to lecture three.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.940
I knew when I was gonna give this lecture

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.790
that it would be after
I had gone to Ukraine

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.020
and back in-between.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.540
So the nice people who are filming this

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.720
asked me not to wear the same
shirt as I wore last week,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.370
both times, which I'm
sure you guys noticed.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.210
I didn't notice.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.531
It was very tactful for you
guys not to mention that.

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:33.729
(class laughs)

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:36.150
'Cause I could've just worn
the same shirt all semester,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.290
and you guys would've been cool.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.540
You wouldn't have said a thing.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.700
I am wearing the same shirt
that I wore on the train,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.290
because the train is 30-

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.820
It's like, from here to,

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.270
in case you were thinking
about doing this next weekend,

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.843
it's a solid 35 hours from
here to the center of Kyiv.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.110
And there's no way to make it shorter.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.030
That's like in the best case.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.530
So I knew when I was
gonna give this lecture

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.810
that I was gonna be going
there and back again.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.780
And so I thought I would make
this subject of this lecture,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.780
what I'm calling Geography
and Deep History,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.030
or maybe just Deep Geography for short.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.200
That is, the way that
we think about places

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.740
and how the way we think
about places then has to do

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.923
with how we apprehend
what happens in the world.

00:01:21.324 --> 00:01:25.890
So the subject today is going
to be naming and placing

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.000
and how the names and
the places then affect

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.820
how we understand events before our eyes.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.340
Which may seem a little
misty and abstract,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.130
but hopefully as I get into the geography

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.080
and then a little bit into the war,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.400
it will come clear

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.120
how the deep notions that we have of place

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.810
tend to suggest, trigger,
push us in certain directions

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.750
when we're confronted with events.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.160
So what is the place I was going to?

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.810
So in the reading, this
is kind of ambiguous.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.870
So the place that I was going
to, maybe it was Ukraine,

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.613
or maybe it was the Ukraine?

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.070
What's the difference?

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.110
I have already told some of
you what the difference is,

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.943
so don't cheat.

00:02:07.943 --> 00:02:09.690
But what is the difference

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.447
between going to "Ukraine"
and going to "the Ukraine"?

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.270
I mean, you probably know
that if you say "the Ukraine",

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.100
you'll get disapproving
looks from the Ukrainians.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.283
But beyond that, what's the difference?

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.890
Yeah.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.210
- [Student] Saying, going to the Ukraine

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.727
implies that Ukraine is a region,

00:02:26.727 --> 00:02:30.310
a sub-region of something like
Russia or the Soviet Union.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.143
- Exactly.

00:02:31.143 --> 00:02:35.010
So if you say "the Ukraine",
it already, it means,

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.380
in Polish you can actually
say "going to the Lithuania",

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.480
which you can't say in English,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.060
but that suggests where
this all comes from.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.490
It's important to remember that English

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.480
is not the master language for everything.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.190
And that very often, the
way we say things in English

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.660
actually comes from somewhere else.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.260
So we say "the Ukraine" because
in Russian and in Polish,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.490
you can say, "na Ukraina".

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.310
Yeah, I even have this
on the sheet this time,

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.600
you can say "na Ukraina",

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.450
which is something like more like "at".

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.820
So you're going to someplace
which is not quite defined.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.957
As opposed to "v",

00:03:07.867 --> 00:03:12.420
"v Ukraina" or "v Ukraini,"
which means "in Ukraine".

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.460
It's a place that's like, if it's a "v",

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.810
that means it can be contained.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.913
So it has a border. It's a defined place.

00:03:18.913 --> 00:03:21.780
Maybe a state, because a state has borders

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.950
and a state is defined.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.250
So if you say "na", you're not
really talking about a state.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.390
And you may be talking about something

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.100
which is kind of misty and undefined

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.560
and maybe a little bit poetic.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.690
So in your reading, up to now,

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.370
like the article from Rudnyts'kyi,

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.808
who cannot be accused of being
anything but a Ukrainian,

00:03:37.808 --> 00:03:40.560
it was still okay in the
'60s for him to be saying,

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.030
or maybe it was required
of him, I'm not sure,

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.310
to say "the Ukraine".

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.830
And while we're on the subject of-

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.900
Okay, so is that clear,
the "v" and the "na"?

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.960
So it's very important,

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.690
if you're speaking Polish
or Ukrainian or Russian.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.060
And so, the Poles, it's interesting,

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.020
the Poles all switched
over in the early '90s.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.068
They switched over.

00:04:02.068 --> 00:04:04.477
When I learned to speak Polish,
you were supposed to say,

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:06.627
"na Litvia", but now people say-

00:04:06.627 --> 00:04:08.700
that means sort of "at Lithuania",

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.533
but now people say "v Litvia",

00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:11.370
meaning "in the state of Lithuania".

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.960
And "na Ukraina" was how I was
taught to say it in Polish.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.993
But now I would say "v
Ukraina" because it's a state.

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:23.493
And Ukrainians have very
clear ideas about this, too.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.310
So while we're on the subject, though,

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.860
you might have noticed
that the capital of Ukraine

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.290
is spelled a couple of different ways

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.183
in your readings as well.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.060
What's the difference there?

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.389
Anybody wanna take a stab at that? Yeah.

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.248
- [Student] One is the Ukrainian spelling

00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:44.790
and the other is the Russian
spelling and pronunciation.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.495
- Yeah. One is a transliteration. Exactly.

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:49.410
So you guys know what transliteration is?

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.310
There are many alphabets,

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.710
and when you render from one
alphabet to another alphabet,

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.000
that's called transliteration
or transcription, technically.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.470
So in the standard English spelling

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.980
of the capital of Ukraine,
for a very long time,

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.640
until very, very recently,
in fact, was Kiev, K-I-E-V.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.170
And that was a
transliteration from Russian.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.050
In Ukrainian, it's Kyiv,

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.670
hence the English
transliteration, K-Y-I-V.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.870
Which is a little bit awkward,

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.060
because there just aren't that many words

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.660
that don't involve '90s punk bands,

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.823
which have Ys and Is in front of them.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.903
The Y-I is not a normal
combination in English.

00:05:36.754 --> 00:05:38.070
And this was an evolution.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.610
So in my early books,
I wrote Kiev, K-I-E-V,

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.607
just because I thought,

00:05:42.607 --> 00:05:44.790
"This has been standard
in English for so long.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.790
It's not really such a big
difference between Kiev and Kyiv.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.000
People reading English are
just gonna be distracted

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.170
by this Y and the I together.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.070
Why should I do it?"

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.080
But then at a certain point, I changed.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.280
The last few books, I spelled it

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.390
with the Ukrainian transliteration.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.770
And if you want, you can check and see

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.390
when the New York Times changes.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.277
Because the New York Times
always does everything right.

00:06:02.277 --> 00:06:04.080
(class laughs)

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.840
And, (laughs) thank you, that was good.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.100
The New York Times always
does everything right,

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.410
but even the New York Times has
to change from time to time,

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.460
how they're gonna do certain things.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.080
And so you can check and
see when they changed

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.507
from spelling it one way to another way,

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:18.120
'cause that represents a certain
kind of cultural consensus.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.860
And so, these things change.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.660
And the reason why it's
interesting that they change

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.000
is that these things that
might seem to be superficial,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.310
like language, are actually very deep,

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.998
because they're the things
that you read and you take in,

00:06:28.998 --> 00:06:30.990
you don't call them into question.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.830
And then they may form
how you see the world

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.320
when you're confronted
with something surprising.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.320
So, the "v" and "na" or the "the":

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.700
Is it a region or a country?

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.180
Kiev or Kyiv: Is it
Russian or is it Ukrainian?

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.623
It's a pretty big-

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.500
And what is actually normal in English?

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.360
This is really interesting,
because you might think,

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.250
let's say, you're, I'm assuming

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.880
many of you are native English speakers.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.920
All of you know English, or
you wouldn't be in this class.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.590
Or you're in this class doing
some kind of weird meditation

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.390
that involves listening to a
language you don't understand,

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.528
which is cool. You'll
probably pass, anyway.

00:07:05.528 --> 00:07:06.919
(class laughs)

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:08.370
I'm assuming if you're doing that,

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.500
you're taking it pass/fail.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.776
But you might think, "Well in English,

00:07:13.776 --> 00:07:15.870
we all have a certain
distance from all this.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.220
There's a certain objectivity,

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.610
whatever it is in English
is somehow just neutral."

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.160
But it's not.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.730
What it is in English has
effects too, very much so.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.140
And what it is in English
is also subject to change,

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.880
as we've seen in both of these examples.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.470
Just in the little span of time

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.570
between when your readings start and now,

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.400
the basic uses in English

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.120
for both the country and
its capital have changed.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.880
And you're presumably, if you have kids,

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.920
which I know that none of
you are thinking about now,

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.270
because when you signed to go to Yale,

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.460
you promised not to get married
and not have kids, I know.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.740
But when you have kids, presumably,

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.100
they will think K-Y-I-V is totally normal.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.620
Maybe you already think
it's totally normal.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.180
And they'll think, it
will not occur to them

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.470
that it might have been some other way.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.333
But these things change all the time.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.880
Now this notion of deep
geography also has to do,

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.690
so I've talked just about
of words and letters.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.390
It also has to do with narratives.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:16.080
So a story can tell you where you are.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.890
A story can tell you where
you are before you get there.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.600
And this occurred to me during this trip,

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.270
because I was talking to a
bunch of American diplomats,

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.500
and we were pondering,

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.540
I mean, just to put it
very briefly and brutally,

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.240
we were pondering why every
American gets everything wrong

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.590
about Ukraine all the time.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.370
Like that basic question,
which you can't help dealing,

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:36.930
you can't help asking
with respect to the war,

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:38.070
because even the people

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:39.600
who were supposed to know
what they're talking about

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.013
were totally wrong.

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.770
It's a luxury for me to
say this because I wasn't,

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.690
but in general, everybody
was totally wrong

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.330
about everything with respect to the war.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.279
Ukrainians are gonna
lose after three days.

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:51.833
They can't possibly fight back.

00:08:51.833 --> 00:08:54.060
They're gonna lose, it's a
stalemate, blah, blah, blah.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.040
Everything that the
consensus has said in the US

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.480
has been wrong the whole time.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.987
And you can't kind of say,

00:08:58.987 --> 00:09:01.065
"Well, this is just a matter
of lack of military analysis,"

00:09:01.065 --> 00:09:01.898
or whatever.

00:09:01.898 --> 00:09:04.110
No, there's something
else deeper going on.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.910
And we were sort of trying
to ponder that together.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.650
And I think it has to do
with the deep narrative

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.510
that everyone is taught.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.520
Because the deep narrative
that everyone is taught,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.320
all these diplomats were taught it too,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.580
everybody who studied East Europe,

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.500
almost everybody, not in this class,

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.570
but almost everyone who
studied East European history

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.360
in the US has the narrative, which says:

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.920
There was Kyiv.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.030
And then, from Kyiv,
somehow there was Moscow,

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.620
there was some kind of transfer.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.570
And the thing in Moscow was the same state

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.790
as the thing in Kyiv, even though that,

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.720
I'm not gonna say "even thoughs",

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.130
I'm just gonna try to tell the narrative.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.650
The thing in Moscow somehow
inherited the traditions

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:41.700
of the thing in Kyiv.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.400
And therefore the thing in
Moscow fulfilled itself,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.670
when it actually incorporated
Kyiv in the late 17th century.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.050
That was somehow natural.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.210
That's part of the destiny of this place.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.013
And it's normal that Moscow and Kyiv

00:09:53.013 --> 00:09:54.540
will be together forever.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.113
And in some way, it's all
Russia. It's all Russia.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.170
So I didn't do a good
job with that narrative,

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.210
because frankly, that's
not what I'm being,

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.240
that's not my job here to do a
good job with that narrative.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.740
But that's the basic narrative.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.150
But the point is that everybody
who has ever studied this

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.560
has that narrative.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.390
And if you have that narrative,

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:19.623
then it makes you think
that Russia's a real place.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:21.750
And what is Ukraine?

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:22.650
Because in that narrative,

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.380
nothing called Ukraine ever appears.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.250
So there must be something
suspicious about Ukraine.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.890
It must be somehow invented
or somehow marginal

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.880
or somehow provincial or
in some way questionable.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.720
Whereas nobody ever questions Russia.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.460
No one ever- I mean, is that wrong?

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.273
No one ever questions that
Russia is a real place.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.640
No one ever questioned the Soviet Union

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.540
was a real place either.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.150
And then, one day it ceased to exist.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.700
No one ever questions that
Russia is a real place.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.860
There's a non-zero chance
that the Russian Federation,

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.270
as we know it, will cease to exist.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.010
In fact, there's a 100%
chance that every place,

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.250
I mean, that's, that shouldn't...

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.780
Know there's a 100% chance

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.220
the Russian Federation
will cease to exist.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.150
All states that have ever
existed have ceased to exist.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.200
There's also a 100% chance

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.663
the United States of
America will cease to exist.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.565
Probably not before you
graduate, don't worry.

00:11:15.565 --> 00:11:17.126
(class laughs)

00:11:17.126 --> 00:11:20.907
Unless you're freshmen, in
which case, eh, I'm not so sure.

00:11:20.907 --> 00:11:21.740
(class laughs)

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.163
But all states cease to exist.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.190
So any narrative about

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.240
how something's gonna be around forever

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.200
is obviously going to be wrong.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.930
But my point here is that as I was sitting

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.960
with my fellow Americans
and thinking this over,

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.540
it kind of seemed clear
that the reason why they,

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.380
Americans, people generally,
have trouble imagining

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.320
that Russia could lose this war to Ukraine

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.700
has something to do with the fact that

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.420
Ukraine isn't quite real in
their minds and Russia is real.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.160
And they wouldn't say that directly,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.210
but the narrative which you're
taught when you're younger

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:55.920
is gonna be there for you always.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.900
We live in time in one direction.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.090
Our history education happens
in only one direction.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:04.320
And the things that get
in first tend to stay.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.530
Now, we don't have to spend a lot of time

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.360
challenging that narrative.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.193
That's not really the point here.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.270
The point though, is
that, just if you believe,

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.370
if this is your deep geography,

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.220
that this was always Russia,

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.260
and then if it wasn't Russia,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.153
that was some kind of divergence.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.680
If that's the way you see it,
then naturally your brain,

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.970
when you get to thinking about the war,

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.860
of course, you're gonna
think Russia's gonna win.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.570
Because this was always Russia,

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.550
and Ukraine is some kind of exception.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.750
Yeah, do you have a question?

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.000
Oh, sorry. Okay.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.710
And, "always" is a very powerful word,

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.309
but it's also a very comfortable word.

00:12:42.309 --> 00:12:44.820
We really like "always".

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.020
We really like for things

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.030
to have a kind of durability, continuity.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.880
We like for there to be
something in the world

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.690
where we know its shape, and
we know its shape is permanent.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.730
And it is a little disturbing

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.260
when it turns out that
none of these things

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.310
that we think are permanent actually are.

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:02.910
That's a little disturbing.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:05.550
And so Russia has made it into the level,

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.510
I think it's fair to say,

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:07.530
you can correct me, I mean,

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:08.910
I realize you guys are young,

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.500
you're from a different
century and all that,

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.710
but Russia has made it into the realm

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.143
of the kind of calmly permanent.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:21.030
It's up there with, I don't
know what, Star Trek, hydrogen,

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.000
it's like things that
have always been there.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.302
Whereas Ukraine has not.

00:13:25.302 --> 00:13:27.870
Whether that's fair or
not, it's probably unfair.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.270
But I think that's the case.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:31.530
And we just don't like it

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:35.283
when something which is "always"
is called into question.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.370
So, "always" is very comforting.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.247
And of course, Russia
itself, that word "Russia",

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:44.310
in a deep geography,

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.490
it's not clear where the
borders of that Russia are.

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:52.200
I mean during this war, there's
been a lot of really, quite,

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.350
let's call it ambitious
Russian propaganda.

00:13:58.893 --> 00:14:01.050
There are now placate,
what do we call placate?

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:01.890
- [Student] Posters.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.153
- No, wrong.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.410
Billboards. (snaps fingers)
There are now billboards.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.480
I mean, that's true, but like billboards.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.612
You get points for speed
though, both of you.

00:14:11.612 --> 00:14:13.800
And it wasn't wrong, I was
just thinking of a different-

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.370
Like billboards in Russia,
which say Russia has no borders.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.050
Which is one way to think about it.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.553
No borders at all.

00:14:22.079 --> 00:14:24.840
But my point is that,
when we think of Russia,

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.460
we could be thinking of the Soviet Union,

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.380
we could be thinking
of the Russian Empire,

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.700
we could be thinking of
a lot of different things

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.050
with very different borders.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:35.267
And since the borders
change, it's a big place,

00:14:35.267 --> 00:14:37.740
we're not surprised to learn

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.690
that a lot of things are Russia.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.360
A lot of things turn out to be Russia.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.373
So you get my point.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.100
There is a reason why

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.680
basically everybody except
the military historians

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.510
kept saying Ukraine is gonna lose.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.050
And one of the puzzles of
this class, if you want,

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:58.876
is to think about why that is.

00:14:58.876 --> 00:15:00.780
Why would everyone be wrong?

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.030
And the suggestion that I'm making

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.880
is that this thing that
I'm calling deep geography

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.050
has something to do with it,

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:10.320
with the words, the
spellings, the narratives

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.800
that indicate to us what is
real and what is not real,

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.680
before we get into the empirical world.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.013
Because as I suggested
before, if you read,

00:15:20.013 --> 00:15:22.620
there aren't that many
military historians left,

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:23.910
but if you read them

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.595
and their boring threads about
logistics and all this stuff,

00:15:27.595 --> 00:15:29.910
they don't know anything
about Russia or Ukraine,

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.110
but they know where the rivers are,

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:32.580
and they know where the
bridges are and so on.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.040
And they've done a much, much better job

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.890
than the people who are supposed
to be Russia specialists.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:38.940
Why is that?

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.580
Why is it that not knowing
anything about Russia

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.680
seems to be an advantage

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.360
in predicting who's gonna win this war?

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.490
And so you see what I'm trying to suggest,

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:50.010
that if what you know about Russia

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:52.590
has this kind of metaphysical underlay,

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:53.974
which is actually, then,

00:15:53.974 --> 00:15:56.370
pushing the empirical evidence around,

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.890
that's going to be a problem for you.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.240
So basically what I've done so far-

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.080
Yeah, go for it.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.360
- [Student] Is there something
distinctive about America

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.040
that makes our narrative wrong?

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.590
Like, is there a different European,

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:09.270
because of the proximity to the area,

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:10.103
that the predictor-

00:16:10.103 --> 00:16:12.960
- Well, in Poland,
there is, yeah. (laughs)

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.910
In Poland, there is.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:15.870
All of this sort of stuff

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.400
that I'm calling anti-colonial and so on,

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.810
like the Poles and the Ukrainians

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:20.550
have been making these
arguments for a long time.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.230
But as soon as you get west of Poland, no,

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.270
it's the basic, it's the
same story dominates.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.150
That Kievan Rus' somehow becomes Moscow,

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.010
somehow all the same place.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.990
When Moscow takes over Ukraine

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.000
in the 17th century or
in the 18th century,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.290
that's somehow a fulfillment,

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:37.560
even though Kyiv and Moscow
have been apart for 500 years,

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.900
even though Kyiv has never
been ruled by Moscow before,

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.480
somehow that's a natural
fulfillment of history.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.563
500 years is a long time, by the way.

00:16:45.563 --> 00:16:49.410
But that basic story is
dominant in Germany and France,

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:51.573
and in England, it's not just us.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.470
It's a story, I'll get to
why it's an ironic story.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.230
So, what I've been doing so far,

00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:59.100
is I've been making a case

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.220
for how important literary
history actually is.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.020
Like how important culture actually is,

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.640
and how important
cultural critique can be,

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.550
like being aware of the
narratives and the words and so on

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.620
can help you to understand the politics,

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.960
or being aware of the culture
can help you understand

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.733
political judgements.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.983
What I want to move on to now,

00:17:17.983 --> 00:17:22.983
is just a word about how
you then address this.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:24.900
How you begin to talk about it.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.930
And one way that we'll be
talking about it in this course

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:31.500
is the very broad approach
of colonial history.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.920
Where one of the first things that you do,

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.480
if you're doing colonial history,

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:41.480
is you question the neutral
claims of knowledge.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:47.160
You question, whether the
things that have been laid down

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:52.160
might in some way have been
laid down with an imperial spin,

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:56.370
which has to then be queried.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.910
So if you're doing colonial history,

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.800
you're taking for granted that there's,

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.190
that the libraries have been
organized the wrong way.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.390
Or at least they've
been, I won't say wrong,

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.910
but they've been organized a certain way,

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.790
that even the language has
been organized a certain way,

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.320
so that you don't see some things

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.490
that you might otherwise see.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:15.660
Now, these are arguments that many of you

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.510
might be more familiar with
in an American context.

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:19.920
Where you would say that
in American history,

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.850
one has to be very careful,

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.441
because American history has
been laid down in such a way

00:18:23.441 --> 00:18:26.100
that you might not see, for example,

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.360
the history of enslaved people.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.460
That's probably a very familiar argument.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.650
But that's a generic
anti-colonial argument

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.080
that can be applied in
lots of other settings

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.980
around the world, including
in Russia and in Ukraine.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.640
So in colonial history,
you're asking yourself

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.150
to question the apparent
neutrality of knowledge,

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.890
including the instruments of knowledge:

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:51.843
languages, spellings, maps,
library organizations.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.307
And you're also asking yourself,

00:18:54.307 --> 00:18:56.067
"Can people change halfway?"

00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:00.300
So if these concepts have
been laid down into us

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.040
and we've accepted them as neutral,

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.040
are we actually capable of
catching ourselves halfway?

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.810
Which is a very important
history question.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:08.040
Because if it's not possible,

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.570
then we might as well give up on history,

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:12.390
because we all have a lot
of legends laid into us,

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:13.410
imperial and otherwise.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.567
And getting to history is a
matter of being able to say,

00:19:16.567 --> 00:19:18.750
"Huh, well, maybe some of
the things I'm committed to

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:21.567
maybe might not be correct."

00:19:24.425 --> 00:19:25.290
So I want one of you to figure out

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.210
how many lecture classes
there are on Ukraine,

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.460
on Ukrainian history right now in the US.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.340
'Cause I'm gonna say one,
and I want you guys to prove

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.340
that there's another lecture
class going on on Ukraine

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.630
in the United States right now.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:37.620
I'm gonna guess that,

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.350
despite the fact that it's
in the news and so on,

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:42.060
I'm gonna guess there's only one.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.480
And that's sort of, that
would be weird, wouldn't it?

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.340
I mean, would you go that far with me?

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.380
I'm gonna say one, maybe two.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.380
Like full-on lecture classes
that are just about Ukraine.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.780
Not classes where
somebody mentions Ukraine,

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.250
or a Ukrainian poem is assigned,

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.990
but a full-on class about Ukraine.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.060
In our country with 300 million people,

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.680
in our fantastic higher
educational system,

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.480
I'm gonna go with one,

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.220
and I'm gonna be surprised
if it's more than two.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.380
So somebody figure that out by next class.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.820
Because it's an example
of what I'm talking about

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.110
with the institutions.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.540
Because no one would disagree
now with the proposition

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.000
that something important
is going on in Ukraine.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.260
If something important
is going on in Ukraine,

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.480
that means something important
could go on in Ukraine.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.980
If something important
could go on in Ukraine,

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.410
why are we so woefully
unprepared for that?

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.000
There has to be an
answer to that question.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.010
It has to go somewhere,

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:26.670
it has to go somewhere deep.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.470
So if you're doing colonial history,

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.560
you question the neutrality of knowledge,

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.749
you look for ways,

00:20:34.749 --> 00:20:36.420
and one of your methods
is you look for ways

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.250
for the colonized to talk back.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.260
Not that they're right, by the way.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.303
It's not about how one is
right and the other is wrong.

00:20:42.303 --> 00:20:45.090
That would be oh, too simple, right?

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.700
But rather, when you hear
how the colonized talk back,

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.120
then it shakes you a little
bit and gets you thinking

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.950
about how you might do things another way.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:56.550
So I was in Kyiv for several days

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.070
and I stayed up late watching,

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:00.780
'cause I didn't anything else to do,

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.930
actually, I had a lot of
other stuff to do, (laughs)

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.360
but I stayed up late
watching Ukrainian television

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.270
because I find it just really
ethnographically interesting

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:13.440
to soak in the news in a country
where something's going on.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.050
And they have ways of talking back.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:17.370
Later in the semester,

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:21.750
you're assigned an article
about "ruscism," that I wrote.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.430
Ruscism, to make it very simple,

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:27.300
is a kind of merger of the
words "Russian" and "fascism".

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:32.300
And ruscism, or with the
personal noun, Ruscisti,

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.460
has become a pretty
standard way of referring

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.860
to Russians who are invading Ukraine.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.393
So standard in the sense
that the newscasters use it.

00:21:41.393 --> 00:21:42.660
They don't say "Russia".

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.280
They rarely say "Russians".

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.530
They almost never say "Russia".

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:49.530
They occasionally say
"the Russian Federation".

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.920
But usually they talk about the Ruscisti,

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.420
and they talk about ruscism.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.663
And when they refer the country,

00:21:56.663 --> 00:21:58.947
they're calling it "Moscovia".

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:01.800
Why would you call it Moscovia?

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.630
Besides the fact that sounds sort of cool.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.180
Why would you call it Moscovia?

00:22:06.852 --> 00:22:07.952
Go for it.

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:09.100
- [Student] You're breaking the link

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.803
between Russia and Kievan Rus'.

00:22:10.803 --> 00:22:12.660
- Yes. You're taking the Rus'.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.482
So, Russia is called Rus',

00:22:14.482 --> 00:22:17.370
which is a name that Russia took in 1721

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.203
when the Russian-

00:22:18.203 --> 00:22:19.920
when the Russian Empire was founded.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.450
If you call it Moscovia,

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:24.090
you're taking away the
historical reference to Rus'

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.010
and you're also kind of naming it

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.480
as a smaller country than it is.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.760
And you're suggesting that its boundaries

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.980
might have a certain
flexibility. (chuckles)

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.880
You're also kind of suggesting
that when you say Moscovia.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.940
The other phrase they use a lot

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.910
as a euphemism for Russia
is "aggressor state".

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:43.260
They say aggressor state.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.240
Which is like neutral.
"It's the aggressor state."

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.730
But it's also not neutral
because you're suggesting that

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.820
that state might always be
an aggressor, and so on.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.730
So the next thing that
I want to talk about

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.240
in this notion of

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.880
geography and deep geography
and deep history is

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.880
I want us to think a little bit about

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.880
this late 20th century,
early 21st century notion,

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.370
that of globalization,

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.789
and the idea that globalization has made

00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:16.530
all this kind of careful
work that we've done

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:19.410
in the first few lectures
of this class irrelevant.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.690
Because what globalization does-

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:22.800
this is the argument.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.470
What globalization has done is that,

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.807
to use Thomas Friedman's phrase,
it's flattened the world.

00:23:28.807 --> 00:23:33.720
It's kind of made everything
the same everywhere.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.300
I mean, his example,
one of his examples, was

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.140
airport lounges,

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.200
which frankly, I don't
think is a great example,

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.030
not least because
they're really different.

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.853
I mean, the ones in America
are terrible, for example.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:47.963
Okay.

00:23:50.355 --> 00:23:53.970
But I give it as a joke
in a different way,

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:54.803
because of course,

00:23:54.803 --> 00:23:58.230
airport lounges is not a
representative experience.

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:00.060
So the fact that airport
lounges might be similar,

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.350
or McDonald's might be similar,

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:02.550
doesn't really take you very far.

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:05.880
But what I'm really going for
here is the overall argument

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.296
that since the end of
communism, something like that,

00:24:09.296 --> 00:24:14.070
since the rise of global trade,
the second globalization,

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.200
things are basically interchangeable.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.850
Places are basically becoming
more like other places.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.340
And people are also
becoming interchangeable.

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.230
Because there are only so
many ideas in the world

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:28.620
and we share them all
instantly through the Internet,

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:29.730
goes the idea,

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:31.860
therefore we're interchangeable.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.317
Maximus and I are interchangeable.

00:24:33.317 --> 00:24:35.100
Zhenya and Maximus are interchangeable.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.749
So it doesn't matter what
TF you have, actually.

00:24:36.749 --> 00:24:37.582
(students chuckle)

00:24:37.582 --> 00:24:38.670
We're all basically interchangeable

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:40.227
because we're all sharing
ideas all the time.

00:24:40.227 --> 00:24:41.760
And there are only so many ideas,

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.230
and we're sharing them instantaneously.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:44.790
So maybe you don't have
the idea I have right now,

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.860
but you can have it instantaneously.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.260
So this is the notion.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.543
So in this utopian view,

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.200
space doesn't really matter.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.710
Traveling distances doesn't really matter.

00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:59.730
'Cause we're all really kind
of all in the same place

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:01.110
in the same time.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:04.380
Now the objections to
this are pretty clear.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:07.443
One of them is, does
information really travel?

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:10.173
In the world where we are,

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.460
well over 90% of the supporters
of Viktor Orbán and Hungary

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.850
believe that Ukraine is
at fault for this war.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.110
And why do they think that?

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:22.710
They think it because that
is their information space.

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:24.780
What Russians and Ukrainians
think about this war

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:25.860
is obviously very different.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:27.540
And it's not just because
they're Russians and Ukrainians,

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:30.720
it's because they're in
different information spaces.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.230
What you and your cousin Harry
may think about Donald Trump

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.130
might be very different.

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:36.630
And that might not just be because

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.640
you and your cousin Harry
have other differences.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.430
It might be because you are
in different media spaces.

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:43.740
One could argue that
what's happened, actually,

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.470
is that information space
has created more differences

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:50.580
or it's created even firmer
boundaries than existed before,

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.380
because the Internet, arguably,

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.470
actually travels less well
than a newspaper does.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:58.140
If I can print the same
newspaper all over the world,

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.330
as used to be the case,

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.030
then I may be actually
doing better than I'm doing

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.730
if I'm the Washington Post

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.557
and I can't get my stuff
out in China today.

00:26:08.557 --> 00:26:13.557
So, information maybe doesn't
really travel, and it may-

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.560
And can we really go everywhere.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.730
I mean, this is obviously on my mind,

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.610
'cause it took me 35 hours
to get back from Kyiv.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:22.920
But there is a certain
cost in going places.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.560
And when you take your
body certain places,

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.480
it does have an effect
on how you see things.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.070
There's a difference
between being in a place

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:32.013
and seeing it on a screen.

00:26:32.856 --> 00:26:35.280
If you go somewhere

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.130
and it involves passports

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:40.380
and changing the gauge of a railway,

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.620
or it involves going through checkpoints,

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.500
that is different from
just clicking on a picture,

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.990
to another picture, to another picture.

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:51.390
It changes the person.

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:52.740
By the way, one of the things

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.710
I found really interesting
on the checkpoints,

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:58.680
and it has to do with this
overall question of language

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.670
and where you are and how
language suggests where you are,

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.878
the Ukrainian soldiers
generally still speak Russian.

00:27:06.878 --> 00:27:08.520
That's not really a big secret.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.280
But at the checkpoints,
if you're at a checkpoint,

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.510
the way they greet you

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:17.160
is they hit you with a really
flowery, friendly Ukrainian.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.350
And as long as you can hit them back

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.660
with a really flowery, friendly Ukrainian,

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.820
you're basically through the checkpoint.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.890
Because there just
aren't that many Russians

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:26.910
who can do that.

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:28.200
So you make sure you show your document,

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.530
but the language itself
is the first checkpoint,

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:33.570
which is kind of interesting.

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:36.060
But where I want to really
go with this is that,

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.510
in historical terms, it
really does seem to matter

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:42.390
how far people get at certain times.

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:44.460
There really do seem to be
historical turning points

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.630
where non-interchangeable
people get, or don't get,

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:51.240
to very special places, and
that it seems to matter.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.270
A big classic example that
we'll get to in about a week,

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.603
in our part of the world, is
the Mongol invasion of Europe.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:00.960
The Mongol invasion of Europe.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.783
Well, when did the Mongols reach Paris?

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:09.480
I see, yes?

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.313
- [Student] They haven't yet.

00:28:10.313 --> 00:28:11.670
- Yeah, good! Good answer.

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:13.740
I like that. I like the "yet",

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.240
I like the way you're
holding the future open

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.311
for good things.

00:28:16.311 --> 00:28:17.275
(class laughs)

00:28:17.275 --> 00:28:19.500
That's awesome. That's really good.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.590
Yeah, so in the late 1230s, early 1240s,

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:25.770
the Mongols aren't defeated by anybody.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.650
The Batu Khan is not defeated by anybody.

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:29.483
We'll talk about this.

00:28:29.483 --> 00:28:30.956
They have the stirrups,

00:28:30.956 --> 00:28:34.890
they have the encirclement
maneuvers, they have the calls.

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:36.810
They're not defeated by anybody in Europe.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:40.260
They destroy every army,
European army, they touch.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.910
And that includes Kyiv,

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.413
but it doesn't include France.

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:48.690
Not because they couldn't have done it,

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:49.890
but because at a certain point,

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:53.130
the Batu Khan has to go
back for a succession issue.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:55.140
'Cause the main Khan has died.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.990
But if the Batu Khan gets to Paris,

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:02.970
I mean, arguably no Renaissance,
no Age of Exploration.

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:04.410
Probably some other part of the world

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.840
carries out the Age of
Exploration, not the Europeans.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.210
And it's a very, very,
very different world.

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:10.920
And that's just a matter
of one person dying.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.480
If one person had died a year later,

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.453
we're probably looking at an
extremely different world.

00:29:16.634 --> 00:29:18.750
Not to say that the moment we're in

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.340
is quite comparable to that.

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:25.340
But it does strike me as
being significant that,

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:27.360
and of course you can't
help but think about this

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.650
when you're standing
in the middle of Kyiv,

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:30.810
but it seems quite significant
that Russian soldiers

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:35.673
do or don't get to Kyiv
in February of 2022.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:40.263
And it's really close. It's really close.

00:29:41.152 --> 00:29:44.820
The Russians land in
the Hostomel Airfield,

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.680
and their plan is to land there,

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.620
drop the paratroopers, drop
the special forces, go in,

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.410
gather up the elite, kidnap
them, probably exterminate them.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:54.690
And that's part of the
plan to take over the city.

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:56.133
And they get to Hostomel,

00:29:56.970 --> 00:30:00.540
which is only about 35
kilometers, 20 miles,

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:01.560
from the center of Kyiv.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.050
They get that far on the
first day of the war.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:07.350
They get that far, but
the Ukrainians stop them.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:08.727
There's a terrible battle around Hostomel

00:30:08.727 --> 00:30:11.490
and it goes on, but the
Ukrainians stop them.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:13.980
Bucha, which you probably heard of

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.810
because of the atrocities,

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:20.763
And, I saw Bucha very briefly too.

00:30:24.174 --> 00:30:26.777
It was also very, that was
also kind of interesting

00:30:26.777 --> 00:30:28.740
because the air raid
sirens went off in Bucha,

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.290
and I was with the Ukrainian general

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:33.990
and he was like, "Well, we
can always go to the basement

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:36.927
of the church, if anything
actually happens."

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:40.950
Bucha is basically a bedroom community.

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:44.700
It's like 28 kilometers from Kyiv.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:45.533
It's a suburb.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:51.030
Irpin, where so many
buildings are destroyed,

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:54.540
it's like a beautiful parked,
it's a really nice place.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.454
You might wanna, if you were
like going up in the world

00:30:57.454 --> 00:31:00.000
and you wanna have a nice
place and drive, commute,

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.440
the American dream.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.640
If you wanted to do that,

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.350
Irpin would be a wonderful place to go.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:05.970
Now it's all shot up,

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:07.590
and there's a huge pile of burned cars,

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:09.360
and there building after
building was destroyed

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.410
by Russian tanks as they were retreating.

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.821
That's like 20 kilometers from Kyiv.

00:31:14.821 --> 00:31:17.700
And the same is true
going the other direction

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.220
across the Dnieper towards Chernihiv.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:24.270
The Russians got very,
very, very close to Kyiv.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.580
But they didn't get to Kyiv.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.530
They didn't get that little difference,

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.930
those last 15 miles of physical geography

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:37.173
would seem to make a huge difference.

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:41.520
And the way people react to the war

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.530
also has a great deal to do with

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:45.360
how they understand the
geography around them.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.233
So for example,

00:31:47.999 --> 00:31:50.490
time after time after time,

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:53.070
people who lived in Kyiv or other cities

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:55.345
would say, when the war started,

00:31:55.345 --> 00:31:58.647
"i should go to the villages,
I should go to the suburbs."

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:00.630
That's a natural thought.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.280
Like, "They're gonna get to Kyiv,

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:06.526
I should go to my dacha, I
should go to my grandmother's,

00:32:06.526 --> 00:32:09.717
I should go to my second house."

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:13.440
But it was the villages actually
that took the punishment,

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.480
time and time again.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.360
People from Kyiv went to Bucha and Irpin,

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.530
because they thought Bucha and Irpin

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:22.430
would be safer than Kyiv, which
turned out not to be true.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:27.240
A friend of mine who lives
close to the Dnieper,

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.439
the Dnieper runs through Kyiv.

00:32:29.439 --> 00:32:31.350
And so, a friend of mine assumed

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:34.740
that the Russians would
get as far as the river,

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.750
and the Ukrainians would
then blow the bridges,

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.480
and then you only have
one direction to flee.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:44.373
So in moments like this, you're
thinking in terms of space.

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.868
I wanted to go someplace besides Kyiv

00:32:47.868 --> 00:32:49.695
and Bucha and Irpin and Hostomel.

00:32:49.695 --> 00:32:51.420
I wanted to get outside of Kyiv Oblast.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.384
And so I went with a friend to Chernihiv,

00:32:54.384 --> 00:32:55.217
the Chernihiv Oblast,

00:32:55.217 --> 00:32:58.533
which is just basically due
north, a little bit east.

00:32:59.466 --> 00:33:03.450
Chernihiv is a fascinating city.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:04.700
We're gonna return to it.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.010
It might have been on one of your maps.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:09.120
The reason it was on one of your maps

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.010
is that it's an old city.

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:14.040
It's 500 years or so older than Moscow.

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.920
It's been there for a very
long time. It's ancient.

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.703
And it is an ancient
center also of scholarship,

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.870
of theology and of scholarship.

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.810
Along with Kyiv, it was one
of the two great centers

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:31.320
of religious, and intellectual
in general, disputation

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:35.070
in what's now Ukraine.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:38.820
And one reason why I
have Chernihiv in mind

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:42.990
is that this whole story
about the Kyiv and the Moscow

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:44.010
and how it's all one place,

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:47.430
that was actually invented
by a guy in Chernihiv.

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:49.110
It was invented by one person.

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:50.960
Like now, we all believe it.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.890
It has this incredible effect on-

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:54.450
And the reason he invented it

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:56.580
had everything to do with geography.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:58.980
Oh, I forgot to put his
name on the sheet. Okay.

00:34:03.666 --> 00:34:06.333
(chalk tapping)

00:34:10.188 --> 00:34:13.800
So in the war, in the Cossack
wars of the 17th century,

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.970
which don't worry, we'll get to,

00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:17.580
in the Cossack wars of the 17th century,

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.950
at the end of it, there's
basically a stalemate

00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:22.590
between Poland, the
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth,

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:24.990
and Moscow.

00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:27.750
And the stalemate is codified

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:31.680
at the Treaty of Andrusovo in 1667.

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.270
And according to that treaty,

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:35.460
the territory on the east of the Dnieper

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:36.930
was going to be Russia,

00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:39.450
and west of the Dnieper
was going to be Poland.

00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:41.610
It was a little unclear
what that meant for Kyiv,

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:43.320
because Kyiv was on both sides,

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.890
but eventually Kyiv
ended up being part of,

00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:48.949
being under control of, Moscow.

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:51.300
And that meant Chernihiv was as well.

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.690
So Kyiv and Chernihiv, which
are these major centers

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:56.910
of European scholarship and thought,

00:34:56.910 --> 00:34:58.920
are now suddenly under
the control of Moscow,

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.833
which has no centers of
scholarship and thought.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.640
And no, that's just a statement of fact.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.710
I mean, there aren't any universities,

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.863
there aren't any academies
in Moscow at that time.

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:16.833
So Lazar Baranovych was
a very intelligent guy,

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.730
one of the great theologians of his time,

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:23.850
and used to enjoying a certain
amount of personal influence,

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:25.050
it should be said.

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:28.560
And when Chernihiv and
Kyiv fall under Moscow,

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.270
he makes a play.

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.650
And see if you could think of a play

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:33.540
which is as good as this play.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:34.593
He says,

00:35:36.608 --> 00:35:41.107
to the fellow Orthodox
clergy in Moscow, he says,

00:35:41.107 --> 00:35:45.303
"You know what? We're
actually all one country.

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:49.560
And the history of your
country, that one in Moscow,

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.290
it actually begins in Kyiv."

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:53.880
And this was news to the people in Moscow.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.960
This had not occurred to them.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.180
This was not their story
of themselves at the time.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.437
But Baranovych said,

00:35:59.437 --> 00:36:02.037
"Your history actually starts with Kyiv."

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.050
And of course, why does he say that?

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:07.623
Because that makes Kyiv really important.

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:12.657
Because, so suddenly Ukraine
and Kyiv and Chernihiv

00:36:12.657 --> 00:36:15.660
are not just places that
got conquered by Moscow.

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:19.860
It turns out they're the beginning
of the history of Moscow.

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:21.690
And that dignifies him,

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:24.780
and it dignifies his
collegium, his school,

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.960
it dignifies Chernihiv, it dignifies Kyiv.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.003
That seems like a pretty good play.

00:36:31.131 --> 00:36:34.563
And it worked. For a while, it worked.

00:36:35.573 --> 00:36:39.750
But you can then imagine
what happens next.

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.000
What happens next is that eventually,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.870
the Russian clerics say, take
over the story on their own.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.000
And they say, "Yes, okay, that's true."

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.440
But, after a couple generations,
they pick up all the tricks

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.270
that the Ukrainians use to argue.

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:55.770
They learn the languages, too.

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:56.603
They start reading

00:36:56.603 --> 00:36:58.560
the Western religious
literature themselves.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.600
They learn about theology and disputation.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.990
And so they take the argument
and they make it their own.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:07.050
And then by the 18th century,
it becomes a secular argument,

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:09.800
no longer a religious argument,
but a secular argument.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.350
When the Russian Empire is formed to 1721,

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:16.590
it's called the Russian
Empire for this reason.

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:20.040
And then when Russia invents
a secular history of itself

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.830
in the 19th century, it's this story.

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:25.590
But this story happened
because of this guy,

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:27.180
who, if he drowned under his horse,

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.920
as people tended to do at the time.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.210
If something had happened to him

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:32.073
on the way to writing that letter,

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:34.890
maybe that story would never have arisen.

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:37.590
And then maybe we would
all analyze this war

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:38.580
a little bit better than we did.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:40.890
And so, again, I'm just
trying to make the point that

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:43.500
where a certain person is
at a certain time and place

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.760
may matter, actually, a lot.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.890
Like you couldn't actually
trade Lazar Baranovych off

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:48.630
for anybody else. He
wasn't interchangeable.

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.670
And those circumstances,

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:53.790
that Chernihiv fell under
Russia at that particular time,

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:55.773
were very specific.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:01.383
So Chernihiv itself was
bombed in early March.

00:38:04.061 --> 00:38:06.360
I was told by the locals, I
haven't checked this yet myself,

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.520
but the guy who was actually
doing the bombing runs

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.740
was himself born in Chernihiv,

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.450
which raises the question
of how you can believe

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:16.593
different stories about the
place where you're from.

00:38:18.008 --> 00:38:20.400
When I was in the rubble, I was in-

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.740
There was one really terrible bombing run

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:25.860
which destroyed, or partially destroyed,

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:30.090
four major apartment
buildings in one neighborhood.

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:33.000
And when I was there talking to people,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.563
I was struck by a few things.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:41.310
Like how, I mean, just like
this place for young people,

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:45.120
like there was a kid there
who was collecting books.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.530
He had a book collection.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:47.970
And he found an iPhone in the rubble.

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:49.350
Like he had all these
books and he had an iPhone,

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:51.900
and as he walked out, he said
to me, "I found an iPhone!"

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.700
Like, this is his childhood.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.225
But also one thing that struck me is that

00:38:56.225 --> 00:38:59.460
in these apartment buildings,

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.290
people don't necessarily know each other

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:02.760
or know who they are.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:03.900
But then after the bombing,

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.030
people did know who one another were,

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:07.890
because they had to help
each other with things.

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:10.680
And then it turns out when
a building is destroyed,

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.270
that it has a history.

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:13.290
One of the reasons you know that is

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:14.460
that the same kind of bombing

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.950
will destroy different kinds
of buildings in different ways.

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:21.840
So Soviet-era kommunalka,
or Soviet-era buildings

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:25.290
that were put together from modules,

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:27.390
are very vulnerable to
bombing, it turns out,

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:31.020
whereas post-1990s buildings
are generally less so.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:34.380
And you can literally see that
worked out before your eyes.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.270
Or another thing, in
this complex of buildings

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:38.490
that was destroyed, one
of them, it turns out,

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:40.650
like this is something you
would never have to know,

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:43.860
but it turns out that
one of them was built for

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:48.000
survivors of the nuclear
disaster in Chernobyl.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.570
And so they all came down
and they got this building

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:54.840
as a way of moving away
from where they were.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.280
But that history would never have come out

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.813
without this other event.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.530
When I went to the suburbs of Chernihiv,

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:03.873
I mean, the villages around,

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:09.205
I talked to a woman who
had five Russian soldiers

00:40:09.205 --> 00:40:11.640
in her house, in her basement.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.460
And I said, "Okay,
they're Russian soldiers,

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.203
but where were they actually from?"

00:40:17.203 --> 00:40:19.200
Were they Russian, or were they some-

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.770
And she's, "Oh, they were
from Bashkiria and Tatarstan,"

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:25.620
and I think maybe one of
them was Russian from Russia,

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.270
he was from Siberia.

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:30.190
And they had a geography.

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:34.920
They had a notion that Ukraine was Russia.

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.840
But it's a funny kind of geography

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.660
because they're from so far away,

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:41.700
they're from thousands of
miles away, in some cases.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.460
And there she is, and they're
all speaking Russian together.

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.140
And she's a native Russian speaker.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.300
She was talking to me in Russian.

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.770
And they're telling her what Russia is

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:51.778
and that she's in Russia.

00:40:51.778 --> 00:40:53.040
And there's something
very strange about that,

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.920
but that's their deep geography,

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.883
and there's something about it
which seems to really matter.

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:02.189
I'm gonna leave you with the last example,

00:41:02.189 --> 00:41:04.539
which I'm sure you probably
already thought of,

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.540
which is Kyiv itself.

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:13.170
So the way we think about cities

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:15.450
often has to do with
particular things that happen

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:16.800
in those cities or in those neighborhoods.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.750
Like Wannsee might not
mean anything to you,

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:23.640
but Wannsee is where
a famous plan was made

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:27.053
for the extermination of the
remaining Jews of Europe.

00:41:27.053 --> 00:41:28.830
It's a part of Berlin.

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:32.280
And so you, you cannot,
once you know that,

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.470
you can't hear Wannsee
and not think about that.

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:35.790
Or Vichy.

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:38.850
So Vichy in France is,

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:40.380
I mean, there's nice soda
water and everything,

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.970
but it's a spa town,

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:44.880
but it's also where the
collaborationist government

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.860
had its capital during
the Second World War.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:48.750
And so Vichy means that.

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:51.330
It's very hard to take
that away from Vichy.

00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:52.980
I would suggest that there's going to be

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:56.670
a little something around Kyiv like that,

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:58.560
but in a positive sense,

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.023
because Zelensky stayed.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.480
If Zelensky had left,
many things, I think,

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.610
would be different, in
the world and in our minds

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:07.170
and in this class, probably.

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:10.500
But he stayed, and I think that makes Kyiv

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:13.950
mean something different than
it would've otherwise been.

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:16.110
In other words, I'm trying to suggest that

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:18.120
this deep geography, although it's real,

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:21.960
is also fungible, it's changeable.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.603
It can be altered by human action.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.840
I'm thinking in particular
about the night,

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.010
a couple of nights into the war,

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:31.310
where he made the selfie
video, where he said,

00:42:32.347 --> 00:42:33.757
"President tooth."

00:42:33.757 --> 00:42:34.740
"I'm here."

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.180
And then he goes on,
"My advisors are here.

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:37.320
We're all here. We're all right here."

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.230
And he was countering Russian propaganda,

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:42.630
which had said he had
fled. That's part of it.

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:44.017
But also, he was saying,

00:42:44.017 --> 00:42:48.387
"I'm here, I'm going to
stay. I'm reassuring people."

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.810
And this is just my last
example of the point that

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:56.550
maybe places and people
aren't so interchangeable.

00:42:56.550 --> 00:43:00.150
That it matters a great deal
that when he said, "I am here,"

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:02.010
the buildings behind him were Kyiv,

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:04.403
and not Lvov and not Warsaw.

00:43:04.403 --> 00:43:07.620
That everyone in Kyiv,
when he said, "I am here,"

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:10.500
could recognize where he was in Kyiv.

00:43:13.695 --> 00:43:17.550
And that "I'm here" was also the counter

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:22.550
to a different kind of deep geography.

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:24.720
Because at the moment when he said that,

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.150
there still were bombs falling in Kyiv

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:28.710
which were meant for him.

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:31.020
And there were still groups of assassins

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:34.020
moving towards Kyiv, or actually
inside the city of Kyiv,

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:35.970
who were meant to kill him.

00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:38.400
And they were operating under
a different deep geography,

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:41.490
deep geography which
goes something like this.

00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:43.200
And I'm not, I don't have to invent this

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.950
because it's what Putin
said in in 2021, 2022,

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:50.130
that Russia and Ukraine
have always been one place,

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:53.640
and the people who say that
Ukraine is a different place,

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.380
they are somehow exotic.

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.000
They somehow come from the outside.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.260
They're Hapsburgs, they're Poles,

00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:59.940
they're Europeans, they're Americans.

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.610
And therefore anyone who
says that there's a Ukraine,

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:04.380
there's something flawed
about that person.

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:05.820
They don't belong there.

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:08.043
They simply need to be removed.

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.770
And we'll remove them lexically,

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:13.410
by calling them Nazis
or whatever it takes.

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:15.090
But we're also going
remove them physically.

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:16.890
Because if we remove them physically,

00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:19.750
then the rest of the Ukrainian
people will go along with us,

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:21.480
and the war will be over.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:23.259
That is a kind of deep geography.

00:44:23.259 --> 00:44:27.240
And that deep geography
animated the attempt

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:31.410
to take Kyiv and to kill this person.

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:34.620
So I had a lot of time
to think about that,

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:36.900
because if you're visiting the President,

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.150
it takes a long time to
get there, obviously.

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:40.740
Because like, they lead you
here and they lead you there,

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.390
and then you're never
gonna find your way out.

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:45.030
They lead you here, it's
all dark and confusing,

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:46.140
and there are lots of checkpoints,

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.000
and there're lots of barriers and things.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.650
And so it gets you to think,

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:53.970
how important is it actually
that this person is right here,

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:55.680
as opposed to another person right here,

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:59.460
or this person being somewhere else?

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.530
So, the deep geography is important.

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:04.080
That was the point of this.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:08.010
But also the deep
geography can be changed.

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:10.350
The deep geography can
be changed by action

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:13.470
and by experience and by renaming.

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:16.923
And I was thinking about that,
I think about that as well.

00:45:18.881 --> 00:45:22.740
I was there during this last,
this Kharkiv counteroffensive,

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:25.230
when the Ukrainians took
back almost all of Kharkiv.

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:27.060
And of course, that
means that Kharkiv Oblast

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:29.520
now means something different
than it did a few days ago.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.200
And for the men and women

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.520
who were involved in that offensive,

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:36.180
it's gonna mean something
different to them as well.

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:40.074
And that the fact that

00:45:40.074 --> 00:45:41.970
so many Ukrainians

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:45.723
have had to move during
this war, for bad reasons,

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:49.723
4 million deported to Russia,

00:45:49.723 --> 00:45:54.723
well over 10 million crossed a
Western border and come back,

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:56.400
people inside the country,

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.650
well over half the population has moved

00:45:58.650 --> 00:45:59.550
in one way or another.

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:04.380
And that moving is associated
with the changing of meanings.

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:08.400
And sometimes it's associated
with a change in meanings

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.792
in a positive sense.

00:46:09.792 --> 00:46:11.640
This is just the very last thought.

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.788
But I was really struck,

00:46:13.788 --> 00:46:15.360
I mean, I'm not trying to
make a happy story of this,

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.770
because of course it's not a happy story,

00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:19.410
but I was really struck by how,

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:22.530
when people talked about
all of this movement,

00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:23.910
whether it was the President himself,

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:25.470
or whether it was some of
the soldiers I talked to,

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:26.760
or whether it was some
of the people in villages

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:29.989
that I talked to, when they
talked about all this movement,

00:46:29.989 --> 00:46:32.970
they had interpretations of it,

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:36.870
that like this in some
way shows who we are.

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:41.870
The fact that we went away and came back,

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:46.470
The fact that we were
able, or have already-

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:48.900
a lot of people have already
rebuilt their houses,

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.580
the fact that we rebuilt,

00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:52.680
the fact that we got back to Kharkiv,

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.870
the fact that Zelensky stayed,

00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:59.130
that these things say something
about us, about who we are.

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:01.410
We can be pushed, we can be pulled,

00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:03.870
but then where we choose to be in the end,

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:05.820
says something about us.

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:06.960
That we choose to fight this war,

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.480
that we choose to help the
people fighting this war,

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:10.770
that we choose to make it through somehow,

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:13.050
says something about us.

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:13.883
And so in that sense,

00:47:13.883 --> 00:47:16.650
like this thing that
people are talking about

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:18.390
as the formation of a nation,
I think, is not quite right.

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:19.560
The nation was already there.

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.900
But how people think about their nation,

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:24.810
and particularly what they
think it means to be free,

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:27.210
and what it's worth sacrificing about,

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:28.800
you can also connect that to space.

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.686
In fact, I guess my point would be,

00:47:30.686 --> 00:47:33.390
you almost have to connect it to space.

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:36.870
It's hard to imagine people
having a story about themselves

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:38.952
which involves risk and values,

00:47:38.952 --> 00:47:42.630
which doesn't also in
some way involve space.

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:44.980
And that's where I'm
gonna leave it. Thank you.

00:47:50.143 --> 00:47:52.810
(gentle chimes)

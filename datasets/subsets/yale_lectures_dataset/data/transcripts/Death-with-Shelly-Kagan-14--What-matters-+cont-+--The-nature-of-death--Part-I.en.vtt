00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.000
Professor Shelly Kagan:
At the end of last class,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.005
I began to raise the question
as to whether or not we should

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:10.162
distinguish two questions that
we would normally be inclined to

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:12.997
run together.
We've been asking ourselves,

00:00:12.997 --> 00:00:16.799
what does it take for me to
survive, for me to continue to

00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:18.286
exist?
But it's possible,

00:00:18.286 --> 00:00:20.353
I suggested,
that we really shouldn't focus

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.470
on the question,
what does it take for me to

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.415
survive?
but rather, what is it that I

00:00:25.415 --> 00:00:28.285
care about?
What is it that matters

00:00:28.285 --> 00:00:30.572
in survival?"
Because it's possible,

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:33.547
logically speaking,
that there could be cases in

00:00:33.547 --> 00:00:36.595
which I survive,
but I don't have what I

00:00:36.595 --> 00:00:40.847
normally have when I survive,
and so I don't have what

00:00:40.847 --> 00:00:43.523
matters.
I don't have what I wanted,

00:00:43.523 --> 00:00:47.101
when I wanted to survive.
It could be that in the typical

00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:49.790
cases of survival I've got that
extra thing.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.604
But we can think of cases in
which I would survive,

00:00:52.604 --> 00:00:55.756
but I don't have that extra
thing, and so I wouldn't have

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:58.693
everything that matters to me.
So as it were,

00:00:58.693 --> 00:01:01.837
we might say,
it might be that mere survival

00:01:01.837 --> 00:01:06.370
or bare bones survival doesn't
really give me what matters.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.620
What I want is survival plus
something else.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.273
And I tried to motivate this
question by having you think

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:17.034
about perhaps the possibility,
if the soul view was the truth

00:01:17.034 --> 00:01:21.074
about personal identity,
but imagine a case of complete

00:01:21.074 --> 00:01:24.126
irreversible amnesia,
while nonetheless,

00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:26.430
it's still your soul
continuing.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.446
But the soul is going to then,
having been scrubbed clean,

00:01:30.446 --> 00:01:33.858
get a brand new personality.
A new set of memories,

00:01:33.858 --> 00:01:36.220
new set of desires,
new set of beliefs.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.858
No chance of recalling your
previous, current,

00:01:39.858 --> 00:01:42.805
personality.
And when I think about that

00:01:42.805 --> 00:01:45.830
case, I find myself wanting to
say, all right,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.780
I'll survive,
but so what?

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.242
I don't care.
It doesn't matter that it's me,

00:01:51.242 --> 00:01:54.603
in that case.
Because I don't just want it to

00:01:54.603 --> 00:01:58.765
be me, I want to have there be
somebody that's me with my

00:01:58.765 --> 00:02:02.372
personality.
Similarly, suppose we thought

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:07.014
that the body view was the
correct view and we imagine,

00:02:07.014 --> 00:02:11.139
again, some sort of case of
complete amnesia.

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:14.780
And so then we get a new
personality and you say,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.042
"Oh look, that's going to be
you, your body,

00:02:18.042 --> 00:02:20.129
your brain.
You're still around."

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.520
And I say, "It could be true,
but so what?"

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.699
It doesn't give me what I want,
when I want to survive.

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:29.819
What I want isn't just for it
to be me.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.770
I want it to be me with my
personality.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.696
So should we conclude,
therefore, that what really

00:02:38.696 --> 00:02:45.030
matters is not just survival but
having the same personality?

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.975
Would that--Suppose the
personality view of personality

00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:50.932
identity was correct.
Would that then give us not

00:02:50.932 --> 00:02:53.580
just personal survival,
but what matters?

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.010
I think that's close,
but no cigar.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.164
Not quite good enough.
To see that,

00:02:59.164 --> 00:03:02.558
recall the fact that according
to the personality view,

00:03:02.558 --> 00:03:05.009
as a theory of personality
identity,

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:09.610
the crucial point isn't that my
personality stay identical.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.543
It's not that I have to keep
all exactly the very same

00:03:12.543 --> 00:03:14.370
beliefs, desires,
and memories.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.298
Because of course,
if we said that,

00:03:16.298 --> 00:03:18.849
then I'd die as soon as I got a
new belief.

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.259
I'd die as soon as I forgot
anything at all of what I was

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:25.186
doing 20 minutes ago.
No, according to the

00:03:25.186 --> 00:03:29.002
personality theory,
what personal identity requires

00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:32.360
isn't item-for-item the same
personality,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.050
but rather the same evolving
personality.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.724
I gain new beliefs,
new desires,

00:03:38.724 --> 00:03:42.125
new goals.
I may lose some of my previous

00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:45.437
beliefs, lose some of my
previous memories,

00:03:45.437 --> 00:03:50.168
but that's okay as long as it's
a slowly-evolving personality

00:03:50.168 --> 00:03:54.072
with enough overlap.
Okay, so now let's consider the

00:03:54.072 --> 00:03:56.820
following case.
I start off.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.372
Here I am.
I've got a set of beliefs,

00:04:00.372 --> 00:04:03.794
a set of--I believe I'm Shelly
Kagan, a set of memories about

00:04:03.794 --> 00:04:06.565
growing up in Chicago.
I have a certain set of desires

00:04:06.565 --> 00:04:09.169
about wanting to finish my book
in philosophy and so forth.

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:12.919
And I get older and older and
older.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:17.111
And I get some new memories and
some new desires and some new

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:19.932
goals.
Suppose that I get very,

00:04:19.932 --> 00:04:23.240
very, very old.
I get 100 years old,

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.939
200 years old,
300 years old.

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:29.692
Somewhere around 200,
suppose that my friends give me

00:04:29.692 --> 00:04:33.190
a nickname.
They call me Jo-Jo.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.649
Who knows why,
they call me Jo-Jo.

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:37.338
And after a while,
somewhere the name spreads and

00:04:37.338 --> 00:04:40.810
by the time I'm 250 years old,
everybody's calling me Jo-Jo.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.678
Nobody calls me Shelly anymore.
And by the time I'm 300,350,

00:04:44.678 --> 00:04:48.629
400, I've forgotten anybody
used to call me Jo-Jo .

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:53.050
And I no longer remember
growing up in Chicago.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.360
I remember things about my
youth when I was a lad of 100.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.627
But I can't go back to what it
was like in the early days,

00:05:01.627 --> 00:05:05.066
just like you can't go back to
what it was like to be four or

00:05:05.066 --> 00:05:07.031
three.
And suppose that all this is

00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:09.069
going on as I'm getting older
and older.

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:12.959
My personality is changing in a
variety of other ways.

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:15.886
I lose my interest in
philosophy and take up an

00:05:15.886 --> 00:05:19.131
interest in, I don't know,
something that completely

00:05:19.131 --> 00:05:23.329
doesn't--organic chemistry holds
no interest to me whatsoever.

00:05:23.329 --> 00:05:26.530
I become fascinated by the
details of organic chemistry.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.069
And my values change.
Now I'm a kind--now,

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:33.073
over here--I'm a kind,
compassionate,

00:05:33.073 --> 00:05:37.329
warm individual who cares about
the downtrodden.

00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:39.590
But around 300,
I say, "The downtrodden.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.289
Who needs them?"
And by the time I'm 500,

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.851
I become completely
self-absorbed and I'm sort of a

00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:48.060
vicious, cruel,
vile person.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.940
Here I am, 800 years old,
900 years old.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.730
Methuselah, in the Bible,
lives for 969 years.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.923
He's the oldest person.
So okay, here I am,

00:05:59.923 --> 00:06:02.660
969 years old.
I'm like Methuselah.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.536
Call this the Methuselah case.
And the crucial point about the

00:06:06.536 --> 00:06:11.129
case is that we stipulate that
at no point was there a dramatic

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:13.764
change.
It was all gradual,

00:06:13.764 --> 00:06:16.541
slow, evolving.
In just the way it happens in

00:06:16.541 --> 00:06:19.433
real life.
It's just that as Methuselah,

00:06:19.433 --> 00:06:22.550
I live a very,
very, very long time.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.402
And by the end of it,
and indeed, let's say somewhere

00:06:26.402 --> 00:06:29.663
around 600 or 700,
I'm a completely different

00:06:29.663 --> 00:06:34.139
person, as we might put it.
I don't mean literally.

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.250
I mean in terms of my
personality.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.559
Now, remember,
according to the personality

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:43.972
theory of personal identity,
what makes it me is the fact

00:06:43.972 --> 00:06:47.440
that it's the same evolving
personality.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.139
And I stipulated that it is the
same evolving personality.

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:57.345
So that's still me that's going
to be around 600 years from now,

00:06:57.345 --> 00:07:01.607
700 years from now.
But when I think about that

00:07:01.607 --> 00:07:05.310
case, I say, "So what?
Who cares?"

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.620
When I think about that case,
I say, "True,

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.720
we'll just stipulate that will
be me in 700 years.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.230
But it doesn't give me what I
want.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.540
That person is so completely
unlike me.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.620
He doesn't remember being
Shelly Kagan.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.060
He doesn't remember growing up
in Chicago.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.912
He doesn't remember my family.
He has completely different

00:07:26.912 --> 00:07:28.730
interests and tastes and
values."

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:34.089
I say "It's me, but so what?
It doesn't give me what I want.

00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:36.329
It doesn't give me what
matters."

00:07:36.329 --> 00:07:40.685
When I think about what I want,
it's not just that there be

00:07:40.685 --> 00:07:44.740
somebody at the tail end of an
evolving personality.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.426
I want that person to be
like me,

00:07:49.426 --> 00:07:54.844
not just be me.
I want that person to be like

00:07:54.844 --> 00:07:57.093
me.
And in the Methuselah case,

00:07:57.093 --> 00:08:00.131
I've stipulated,
it ends up not being very much

00:08:00.131 --> 00:08:03.000
like me at all.
So it doesn't give me what I

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.615
want.
When I think about what I

00:08:04.615 --> 00:08:06.675
want--and I'm just going to
invite you to,

00:08:06.675 --> 00:08:09.098
each one of you,
to ask yourself what is it that

00:08:09.098 --> 00:08:11.987
you want, what matters to you in
survival?--when I think about

00:08:11.987 --> 00:08:14.949
what matters to me,
it's not just survival.

00:08:14.949 --> 00:08:19.180
It's not just survival as part
of the same ongoing personality.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.850
It's survival with a
similar personality.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.388
Not identical,
item for item,

00:08:26.388 --> 00:08:30.560
but close enough to be fairly
similar to me.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.830
Give me that,
and I've got what matters.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:37.220
Don't give me that,
and I don't have what mattes.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.850
In fact, I'm inclined to go a
little bit further.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.952
Once you give me that,
give me that there's somebody

00:08:42.952 --> 00:08:46.176
there with my similar
personality, I think that may be

00:08:46.176 --> 00:08:48.944
all that matters.
Up to this moment,

00:08:48.944 --> 00:08:51.723
I've been saying,
okay, survival by itself isn't

00:08:51.723 --> 00:08:53.993
good enough.
You need survival plus

00:08:53.993 --> 00:08:57.040
something else.
And I'm now suggesting that in

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.966
my own case at least,
the something else is,

00:08:59.966 --> 00:09:03.299
something extra,
is same, similar personality.

00:09:03.299 --> 00:09:06.734
It might be that I get what
matters to me even if I have,

00:09:06.734 --> 00:09:09.065
as long as I have,
similar personality,

00:09:09.065 --> 00:09:11.580
even if I don't have
survival.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.620
Suppose--I don't believe in
souls, but suppose there really

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.969
are souls.
And suppose the soul is the key

00:09:17.969 --> 00:09:21.381
to personal identity.
And suppose the thing that

00:09:21.381 --> 00:09:23.889
Locke was worried about really
does happen.

00:09:23.889 --> 00:09:28.108
Every day at midnight God
destroys the old soul and

00:09:28.108 --> 00:09:33.507
replaces it with a new soul that
has the very same personality as

00:09:33.507 --> 00:09:36.893
the one before midnight,
similar personality,

00:09:36.893 --> 00:09:38.992
same beliefs,
desires, and so forth and so

00:09:38.992 --> 00:09:40.767
on.
If I were to discover that's

00:09:40.767 --> 00:09:43.387
what was happening
metaphysically and the soul view

00:09:43.387 --> 00:09:45.955
was the true theory of personal
identity, I'd say,

00:09:45.955 --> 00:09:48.408
"Huh!
Turns out I'm not going to

00:09:48.408 --> 00:09:51.050
survive tonight.
I'm going to die.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.679
Who cares?
There'll be somebody around

00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:57.711
tomorrow with my beliefs,
my desires, my goals,

00:09:57.711 --> 00:10:00.150
my ambitions,
my fears, my values.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.096
Good enough.
I don't really care whether I'm

00:10:03.096 --> 00:10:06.006
going to survive.
What I care about is whether

00:10:06.006 --> 00:10:10.031
there'll be somebody that's
similar to me in the right way

00:10:10.031 --> 00:10:14.722
in terms of my personality."
So it might be that the whole

00:10:14.722 --> 00:10:20.330
question we've been focusing on,
"What does it take to survive?"

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.769
may have turned out to be
misguided.

00:10:22.769 --> 00:10:26.350
The real question may not be
"What does it take to survive?"

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:30.713
but "What matters?"
And it might turn out that

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:34.339
although, normally,
having what matters goes hand

00:10:34.339 --> 00:10:37.511
in hand with surviving,
logically speaking,

00:10:37.511 --> 00:10:40.857
they can come apart.
And what matters,

00:10:40.857 --> 00:10:45.057
or so it seems to me,
at least, isn't survival per

00:10:45.057 --> 00:10:49.000
se, but rather having the same
personality.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.414
Since I'm inclined to think
that the body view is the

00:10:53.414 --> 00:10:56.639
correct theory of personal
identity,

00:10:56.639 --> 00:11:00.267
I want to say,
look, somebody around tomorrow,

00:11:00.267 --> 00:11:05.103
if overnight God replaces my
body with some identical looking

00:11:05.103 --> 00:11:08.650
body and keeps the personality
the same,

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.269
that won't be me, but all right.
It's good enough.

00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:17.330
What matters to me isn't
survival per se.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.919
Indeed, isn't survival,
strictly, at all.

00:11:19.919 --> 00:11:23.980
It's having the same
personality.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.661
Still, what does that leave us?
That leaves us with the

00:11:27.661 --> 00:11:31.171
possibility that there could be
cases where you die and you

00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:34.693
don't survive.
Maybe God swoops me up upon

00:11:34.693 --> 00:11:36.273
death.
My body dies,

00:11:36.273 --> 00:11:40.512
but he sort of swoops up my
information about my personality

00:11:40.512 --> 00:11:44.248
and recreates somebody up in
heaven with that similar

00:11:44.248 --> 00:11:46.366
personality.
It won't be me,

00:11:46.366 --> 00:11:48.633
if it's a different soul.
It won't be me,

00:11:48.633 --> 00:11:52.396
if it's a different body.
But still, I want to say,

00:11:52.396 --> 00:11:57.529
it will give me what matters!"
That's a possibility.

00:11:57.529 --> 00:11:59.448
But I don't,
in fact, think it's going to

00:11:59.448 --> 00:12:01.636
happen.
I believe--I've told you I'm a

00:12:01.636 --> 00:12:04.739
physicalist--I believe that
what's going to happen is,

00:12:04.739 --> 00:12:07.960
at the death of my body,
that's going to be the end.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.367
Now, what I've been arguing is
that, logically speaking,

00:12:11.367 --> 00:12:14.775
even if you are a physicalist,
that doesn't rule out the

00:12:14.775 --> 00:12:17.979
possibility of survival.
Suppose you believe in the

00:12:17.979 --> 00:12:20.251
personality theory.
Your body's going to die,

00:12:20.251 --> 00:12:21.940
but your personality could
continue.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.928
Or it might be,
even as a body theorist,

00:12:24.928 --> 00:12:28.990
I'll cease to exist but what
matters will continue.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:33.600
These are possibilities.
But for what it's worth,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.149
I don't in fact believe they're
actually what's going to happen.

00:12:38.149 --> 00:12:41.156
Of course, these are also
theological matters,

00:12:41.156 --> 00:12:45.164
and so I'm not trying to say
anything here today to argue you

00:12:45.164 --> 00:12:48.237
out of the theological
conviction that God will

00:12:48.237 --> 00:12:52.379
resurrect the body or God will
transplant your personality into

00:12:52.379 --> 00:12:55.456
some new angel body,
but if you believe in the

00:12:55.456 --> 00:12:57.194
personality theory,
that will be you,

00:12:57.194 --> 00:13:00.128
or what have you.
I'm not--it's not my goal here

00:13:00.128 --> 00:13:03.870
to argue for or against these
theological possibilities,

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.443
having at least taken the time
to explain philosophically how

00:13:07.443 --> 00:13:10.868
we could make sense of them.
But I do want to report that I

00:13:10.868 --> 00:13:14.675
don't believe them.
I believe that when my body

00:13:14.675 --> 00:13:19.990
dies, that's it for me.
There won't be anything that's

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.976
me afterwards.
There won't be anything

00:13:22.976 --> 00:13:26.649
that's--even though what I want
per se isn't survival.

00:13:26.649 --> 00:13:31.190
Not only won't I survive,
I believe after my death what

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:35.899
matters to me in that situation
won't continue either.

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:41.414
There won't be somebody with a
similar personality to mine

00:13:41.414 --> 00:13:47.021
after the death of my body.
All right, so having spent all

00:13:47.021 --> 00:13:53.090
this time getting clearer about
the nature of personal identity,

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:57.118
and getting clearer about what
people are, and the

00:13:57.118 --> 00:14:00.222
possibilities of survival,
and so forth,

00:14:00.222 --> 00:14:02.939
having argued against the
existence of souls,

00:14:02.939 --> 00:14:05.656
and for a physicalist
view--physicalism seems

00:14:05.656 --> 00:14:09.669
compatible with both the body
view and the personality view,

00:14:09.669 --> 00:14:12.410
leave it to you to decide
between them,

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:16.159
I myself currently favor the
body view--let's ask,

00:14:16.159 --> 00:14:21.868
"So just what is death,
anyway, on the physicalist

00:14:21.868 --> 00:14:24.243
view?"
It might seem as though it's

00:14:24.243 --> 00:14:27.283
fairly straightforward.
A person, after all,

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:31.973
is just a body that's
functioning in the right way so

00:14:31.973 --> 00:14:36.546
as to do these person tricks.
It's P-functioning,

00:14:36.546 --> 00:14:39.139
as we've put it at one time or
another.

00:14:39.139 --> 00:14:42.376
And so a person is just a
P-functioning body,

00:14:42.376 --> 00:14:46.120
whether you emphasize the body
side there or the personality

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.110
side of that equation.
What exactly is it to die?

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.860
When do I die?
Let's turn to that question.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:58.788
When do I die and what is death?
Roughly speaking,

00:14:58.788 --> 00:15:01.688
the answer, presumably,
on the physicalist view,

00:15:01.688 --> 00:15:04.957
is going to be something
like--if I'm alive when we've

00:15:04.957 --> 00:15:08.752
got a P-functioning body,
roughly speaking,

00:15:08.752 --> 00:15:13.378
I die when that stops
happening, when the body breaks

00:15:13.378 --> 00:15:16.669
and it stops functioning
properly.

00:15:16.669 --> 00:15:19.971
That seems, more or less,
the right answer from the

00:15:19.971 --> 00:15:24.325
physicalist point of view,
although as we'll see probably

00:15:24.325 --> 00:15:28.000
later today, we need to refine
it somewhat.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.129
But first, let's ask a slightly
different question.

00:15:32.129 --> 00:15:39.000
Which functions are crucial in
defining the moment of death?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.647
After all, we've got the idea
that here's the body,

00:15:41.647 --> 00:15:43.770
here's a functioning body.
Here's one in front of you.

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:46.269
Each one of you has got one.
You're a functioning body.

00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:50.039
There's a variety of functions
that your body's engaged in.

00:15:50.039 --> 00:15:53.626
Some of them have to do with
merely digesting food and moving

00:15:53.626 --> 00:15:56.137
the body around,
and making the heart beat,

00:15:56.137 --> 00:16:00.838
and the lungs open and close.
Call those things the bodily

00:16:00.838 --> 00:16:03.066
functions.
And there's also,

00:16:03.066 --> 00:16:06.877
of course, in each one of our
cases, there's these higher

00:16:06.877 --> 00:16:10.893
mental cognitive functions that
I've been calling the person

00:16:10.893 --> 00:16:15.061
functioning,
there's the B-functions and

00:16:15.061 --> 00:16:20.160
there's the P-functions.
Well, roughly speaking,

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.820
I die when the functioning
stops, but which functions?

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:27.610
Is it the body functions or the
personality functions?

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:30.550
So let's take a look at the
normal situation.

00:16:35.809 --> 00:16:37.440
Here's the existence of your
body.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:44.222
And during most of the
existence of your body,

00:16:44.222 --> 00:16:45.550
it's functioning.

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.280
The body functions.

00:16:59.779 --> 00:17:01.840
Over here, it's no longer
functioning.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:02.140
It's a corpse.

00:17:07.279 --> 00:17:09.899
During some of the period when
your body's functioning,

00:17:09.899 --> 00:17:11.840
it's doing the higher cognitive
stuff.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.770
The personality functions.

00:17:30.109 --> 00:17:33.161
Now, this is the very early
stuff when your body's still

00:17:33.161 --> 00:17:35.880
developing and your brain hasn't
turned on yet,

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.727
or your brain is turned on,
but it hasn't actually become a

00:17:38.727 --> 00:17:40.973
person yet, right?
At least in the case of the

00:17:40.973 --> 00:17:43.460
fetus, it's not self-conscious.
It's not rational.

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.810
It's not able to communicate.
It's not creative and so forth.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:54.070
That comes later.
All right, so there's Phase A.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.860
There's Phase B.
There's Phase C.

00:18:02.059 --> 00:18:06.660
That's the normal situation,
the normal case.

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:14.718
The body exists.
It functions for a while before

00:18:14.718 --> 00:18:18.501
the P-functioning begins.
And then after a while the body

00:18:18.501 --> 00:18:20.519
and P-functioning are
both going on.

00:18:20.519 --> 00:18:22.019
And then after a while they
stop.

00:18:22.019 --> 00:18:24.519
In the normal case,
I'm in a car accident or

00:18:24.519 --> 00:18:27.309
whatever it is,
and my body stops functioning,

00:18:27.309 --> 00:18:32.432
my personality stops
functioning, and you're left

00:18:32.432 --> 00:18:36.549
with a corpse.
When did I die?

00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:43.240
Well, the natural suggestion is
to say I died here.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:47.490
I'll draw my little star,
an asterisk.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:50.200
In the normal case,
I die when my body stops

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.099
functioning, in terms of the
body functions.

00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:55.131
And it stops functioning in
terms of the personality

00:18:55.131 --> 00:18:55.610
functions.

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:02.546
That's the normal case.
But we could still ask the

00:19:02.546 --> 00:19:06.335
philosophical question.
Since what we had here was

00:19:06.335 --> 00:19:11.317
simultaneously losing both the
ordinary body functioning and

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:14.609
the special personality
functioning,

00:19:14.609 --> 00:19:21.059
which loss was the crucial one
in terms of defining the moment

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:23.981
of my death?
Let's come back to that

00:19:23.981 --> 00:19:27.961
question in a minute.
First, I want to ask a slightly

00:19:27.961 --> 00:19:34.400
different question.
When did I cease to exist?

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:40.372
Or, to put it slightly
differently, do I exist during

00:19:40.372 --> 00:19:46.000
Phase C, when the body has
stopped functioning?

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.190
Both in terms of body functions
and personality functions,

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.170
I'm just a corpse.
Do I exist?

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:56.081
Now, let's suppose we believe
the personality theory of

00:19:56.081 --> 00:19:59.538
personal identity.
According to the personality

00:19:59.538 --> 00:20:02.640
theory of personal identity,
for something to be me,

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.035
it's got to have the very same
personality, the same evolving,

00:20:07.035 --> 00:20:09.630
but still the same set of
beliefs,

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:13.687
desires, goals, so forth.
Now, during period C,

00:20:13.687 --> 00:20:19.130
there's nothing with my
personality, right?

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.170
Nobody thinks they're Shelly
Kagan.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:24.698
Nobody has my memories,
beliefs, exact desires,

00:20:24.698 --> 00:20:28.860
goals and so forth.
Pretty clearly then,

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:35.619
on the personality theory,
I don't exist at Phase C.

00:20:35.619 --> 00:20:38.922
That's why it's natural to
point to the moment of star when

00:20:38.922 --> 00:20:41.030
we say that's when my death
occurs.

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:45.857
I don't exist at Phase C.
But interestingly,

00:20:45.857 --> 00:20:50.814
things look rather different if
we accept not the personality

00:20:50.814 --> 00:20:54.119
theory, but instead,
the body theory.

00:20:54.119 --> 00:20:57.642
After all, according to the
body theory of personal

00:20:57.642 --> 00:21:02.080
identity, for somebody to be me,
they've got to have my body.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.150
Follow the body.
Same body, same person.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:11.600
All right, here we are.
Here's my corpse.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.829
What is a corpse?
It's a body,

00:21:14.829 --> 00:21:20.329
and indeed, my corpse is
my body.

00:21:20.329 --> 00:21:25.670
So follow the body means follow
the person.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:27.670
The corpse is still around.
It means my body's still around.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.319
It means I'm still
around.

00:21:30.319 --> 00:21:34.940
It's like, I mean,
I'm dead, but I still exist.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.678
It's like a bad joke, right?
So here's the question we

00:21:38.678 --> 00:21:45.529
started the class off with.
Will you survive your death?

00:21:45.529 --> 00:21:48.759
Will you still exist after
death?

00:21:48.759 --> 00:21:51.420
Well, there's good news and
there's bad news.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.682
Since I believe in the body
theory, the good news is,

00:21:55.682 --> 00:21:58.470
you will exist after your
death.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:02.140
The bad news is,
you'll be a corpse.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.841
That seems like a bad joke,
but if the body theory is

00:22:05.841 --> 00:22:12.177
right, it's not a joke at all.
It's literally speaking the

00:22:12.177 --> 00:22:14.206
truth.
I will exist,

00:22:14.206 --> 00:22:18.359
at least for a while.
Eventually, the body will

00:22:18.359 --> 00:22:22.359
decay, turn into atoms or
whatever it is,

00:22:22.359 --> 00:22:25.074
decompose.
At that point my body no longer

00:22:25.074 --> 00:22:26.121
exists.
At that point,

00:22:26.121 --> 00:22:29.651
I will no longer exist.
But at least for a while,during

00:22:29.651 --> 00:22:33.078
period C, the body theorist
should say, "Yeah,

00:22:33.078 --> 00:22:36.561
you will exist.
You will exist,

00:22:36.561 --> 00:22:42.095
but you won't be alive."
It just reinforces the point

00:22:42.095 --> 00:22:46.341
that I was trying to make a few
moments ago that the crucial

00:22:46.341 --> 00:22:50.605
question is not survival per se.
The crucial question is,

00:22:50.605 --> 00:22:53.150
what did you want out of
survival?

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:58.728
And one of the things I wanted
out of survival was to be

00:22:58.728 --> 00:23:02.187
alive.
All right, so on the body view,

00:23:02.187 --> 00:23:04.125
I exist here,
but I'm not alive,

00:23:04.125 --> 00:23:06.500
so it doesn't give me what
matters.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:11.266
On the personality view,
I don't exist when I'm a

00:23:11.266 --> 00:23:14.563
corpse.
Let's go back and ask the

00:23:14.563 --> 00:23:17.640
question, well,
so which is it?

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.341
Which is the one that's the
crucial for defining the moment

00:23:21.341 --> 00:23:23.467
of death, right?
Even on the body view,

00:23:23.467 --> 00:23:25.910
the fact that I exist isn't
good enough, because I'm not

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.640
alive.
I want to know, when am I alive?

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.575
When am I dead?
So what's crucial for defining

00:23:30.575 --> 00:23:33.565
the moment of death?
Is it body functioning or

00:23:33.565 --> 00:23:37.097
personality functioning?
Well, you can't tell by

00:23:37.097 --> 00:23:40.781
thinking about the normal case,
because the

00:23:40.781 --> 00:23:46.044
B-functioning and the
P-functioning stop at the

00:23:46.044 --> 00:23:48.467
same time.
But suppose we draw the

00:23:48.467 --> 00:23:49.190
abnormal case.

00:23:58.099 --> 00:23:59.860
All right, here's C with the
corpse again.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:10.943
Here's a period when the body's
been functioning and goes like

00:24:10.943 --> 00:24:13.456
this.
Here's the period back here,

00:24:13.456 --> 00:24:16.768
A, where the body's been
functioning, but the personality

00:24:16.768 --> 00:24:19.973
hasn't started yet.
And now imagine,

00:24:19.973 --> 00:24:22.830
so this is personality.

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:32.920
Over here we've got body.
We'll call this B again.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:38.258
What I've done is imagine a
case in which the personality

00:24:38.258 --> 00:24:43.596
functioning stops before the
rest of the body functioning

00:24:43.596 --> 00:24:46.482
stops.
Obviously, the phases are no

00:24:46.482 --> 00:24:50.208
longer in alphabetical order,
but I introduced D in the

00:24:50.208 --> 00:24:54.279
middle so the other phases could
keep their same labels.

00:24:54.279 --> 00:24:59.400
Well, here's a case where--When
does the body functioning stop?

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.335
End of D.
When does the personality

00:25:02.335 --> 00:25:05.520
functioning stop?
End of B.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:13.450
So we've got two candidates.
Star one and star two.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:22.289
Star one says death occurs when
personality stops functioning.

00:25:22.289 --> 00:25:28.354
Star two says no,
no, death occurs when bodily

00:25:28.354 --> 00:25:31.698
functioning stops.
Well, again,

00:25:31.698 --> 00:25:33.700
the question is,
what should we say?

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.461
I think we're going to perhaps
be drawn to different answers,

00:25:36.461 --> 00:25:39.315
depending on whether we accept
the body view or the personality

00:25:39.315 --> 00:25:45.279
view.
Suppose we accept the body view.

00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:50.950
Well, look, if the relevant
question is "When do I die?"

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:54.572
and I am a body,
then presumably the

00:25:54.572 --> 00:26:00.782
straightforward answer at least
is going to be "I die when my

00:26:00.782 --> 00:26:07.110
body stops functioning."
When is that?

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:12.881
Star two.
During period D,

00:26:12.881 --> 00:26:21.152
I'm still alive,
but I'm no longer functioning

00:26:21.152 --> 00:26:30.690
as a person.
I am no longer a person.

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.021
That's interesting.
It's not just that I

00:26:33.021 --> 00:26:36.600
exist.
In C, I can exist without being

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.156
a corpse;
or rather, without being alive,

00:26:40.156 --> 00:26:46.882
as a corpse.
In D, I'm alive but I'm not a

00:26:46.882 --> 00:26:51.615
person.
You recall when we talked about

00:26:51.615 --> 00:26:55.009
Plato, we introduced the notion
of essential properties.

00:26:55.009 --> 00:26:59.670
And it seems that if we accept
the body view,

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:06.024
we have to say being a person
is not an essential property of

00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:11.075
being something like me.
It's not one of my essential

00:27:11.075 --> 00:27:15.164
properties that I'm a person.
I am, in fact,

00:27:15.164 --> 00:27:21.390
a person, but that won't always
be true of me.

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:25.643
When I'm a corpse,
I will cease to be a person,

00:27:25.643 --> 00:27:29.984
but I'll still exist.
And if we have this unusual

00:27:29.984 --> 00:27:34.249
case in which my brain has a
stroke, loses its higher

00:27:34.249 --> 00:27:38.634
cognitive functioning,
so that the body continues to

00:27:38.634 --> 00:27:41.614
breathe, eat,
respirate, and so forth,

00:27:41.614 --> 00:27:46.292
the heart continues to pump,
but there's no longer anything

00:27:46.292 --> 00:27:49.057
capable of thinking,
reasoning, we say,

00:27:49.057 --> 00:27:50.769
look,
I still exist.

00:27:50.769 --> 00:27:54.529
Indeed, I'm alive,
but I'm not a person.

00:27:54.529 --> 00:28:00.797
Being a person is something you
can go through for a period of

00:28:00.797 --> 00:28:05.085
time and cease to be.
In the same way that being a

00:28:05.085 --> 00:28:09.144
child is a phase you can go
through for a period of time and

00:28:09.144 --> 00:28:13.650
then cease to be.
Or being a professor is a phase

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:17.789
you can go through and then
cease to be.

00:28:17.789 --> 00:28:20.930
You can still exist without
being a professor.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:24.279
I can still be alive without
being a professor.

00:28:24.279 --> 00:28:27.094
Well, on the body view,
we have to say the same thing

00:28:27.094 --> 00:28:31.971
about being a person.
Being a person is something

00:28:31.971 --> 00:28:37.890
that I, namely my body,
can do for a while.

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:41.430
It wasn't doing it back here in
A.

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:44.569
It certainly won't be doing it
in C.

00:28:44.569 --> 00:28:46.559
And it won't be doing it in D
either.

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:51.199
Being a person is something on
the body view that I am only for

00:28:51.199 --> 00:28:55.690
part of my existence and indeed,
only for part of my life.

00:28:59.799 --> 00:29:02.650
Well, that's what it seems we
should say on the body view.

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:07.259
What if instead we accept the
personality theory?

00:29:07.259 --> 00:29:11.050
Then--actually,
one more remark about the body

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:13.359
view.
Notice that if you accept this

00:29:13.359 --> 00:29:16.797
account of what the body view
should say about when death is,

00:29:16.797 --> 00:29:19.090
my death is when I cease to be
alive.

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:23.235
I am my body.
So my death occurs at star two,

00:29:23.235 --> 00:29:29.369
loss of bodily function.
And being a person is just a

00:29:29.369 --> 00:29:31.864
phase.
Notice that if we say that,

00:29:31.864 --> 00:29:35.296
then there's something somewhat
misleading about the standard

00:29:35.296 --> 00:29:38.442
philosophical label for the
problems we've been thinking

00:29:38.442 --> 00:29:40.730
about for the last couple of
weeks.

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:44.869
We've been worrying about the
nature of personal identity.

00:29:44.869 --> 00:29:47.815
That is to say,
what is it for somebody to be

00:29:47.815 --> 00:29:49.631
me.
But notice that that label,

00:29:49.631 --> 00:29:52.759
"personal identity," "the
problem of personal identity,"

00:29:52.759 --> 00:29:57.602
seems to have built into it the
assumption that whatever it is

00:29:57.602 --> 00:30:00.460
that's me is going to be a
person.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.500
Is it the same person or
not?

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:07.469
Now, it turns out that that
assumption, standardly built

00:30:07.469 --> 00:30:10.140
into the usual label,
may be false.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.296
On the body view,
it could still be me without

00:30:13.296 --> 00:30:16.536
being a person at all.
So the problem of existence

00:30:16.536 --> 00:30:18.900
through time,
or persistence through time,

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:22.130
shouldn't be called the problem
of personal identity,

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.370
but just the problem of
identity.

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:28.689
You know, a footnote.
Turning now again to the

00:30:28.689 --> 00:30:33.194
personality theory.
If we accept the personality

00:30:33.194 --> 00:30:38.333
theory of personal identity,
then for someone to be me,

00:30:38.333 --> 00:30:42.519
they've got to have the same
personality.

00:30:42.519 --> 00:30:45.167
And so for something,
for me to exist,

00:30:45.167 --> 00:30:47.599
my personality has to be
around.

00:30:47.599 --> 00:30:51.004
Well, that's why we said up
here that in Phase C when

00:30:51.004 --> 00:30:53.230
there's a corpse,
I don't exist.

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:56.230
There's nothing with my
personality.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:31:02.410
As a corpse, I no longer exist.
What should we say about Phase

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:08.537
D, on the personality theory?
Here, my body is functioning,

00:31:08.537 --> 00:31:13.000
but my personality has been
destroyed.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.480
Nothing exists with my beliefs,
memories, desires,

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.589
fears, values,
goals, ambitions.

00:31:20.589 --> 00:31:26.174
Well, if I just am my
personality, then I don't exist

00:31:26.174 --> 00:31:31.543
in Phase D, because there's
nothing there to be me,

00:31:31.543 --> 00:31:36.463
nothing with my personality.
According to the personality

00:31:36.463 --> 00:31:41.179
theory, follow the personality.
The personality ended at star

00:31:41.179 --> 00:31:45.133
one.
So I don't exist at Phase D on

00:31:45.133 --> 00:31:48.520
the personality theory.
Okay good.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:54.190
I don't exist.
But what should we say?

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:58.950
Am I alive or not?
Well, my body's still alive.

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:01.400
So should we say that
I'm alive?

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.470
After all, my body's still
functioning until star two.

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:07.086
During Phase D,
my body seems to still be

00:32:07.086 --> 00:32:10.075
alive.
Should we say that I'm

00:32:10.075 --> 00:32:11.740
alive?
That's rather hard to believe,

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:12.855
right?
Think about what it would mean

00:32:12.855 --> 00:32:15.574
to say that.
We'd being saying on the

00:32:15.574 --> 00:32:18.799
personality theory,
I don't exist,

00:32:18.799 --> 00:32:22.094
but I'm alive.
That seems like a very

00:32:22.094 --> 00:32:24.619
unpalatable combination of
views.

00:32:24.619 --> 00:32:29.990
How can I be alive if I don't
even exist?

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:35.140
So it seems we have to say I'm
not alive during Phase D.

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:41.290
Not only don't I exist during
Phase D, I'm not alive either.

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:46.200
Yet, my body is alive;
that's the whole stipulation.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.914
So it looks as though the
personality theorist is going to

00:32:49.914 --> 00:32:53.630
have to introduce a distinction
between my being alive,

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:57.666
on the one hand,
and my body being alive,

00:32:57.666 --> 00:33:03.263
on the other.
In the normal case--up at the

00:33:03.263 --> 00:33:09.460
top, those two deaths occur
simultaneously.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:14.314
My body stops being alive at
the very same moment that I

00:33:14.314 --> 00:33:18.053
cease being alive.
But in the abnormal case,

00:33:18.053 --> 00:33:22.710
the personality theorist needs
to say, or so it seems to me,

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:28.855
the two deaths come apart.
The death of my body occurs at

00:33:28.855 --> 00:33:36.190
star two.
My death occurs at star one.

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:39.805
Notice that the body theorist
didn't need to draw that

00:33:39.805 --> 00:33:44.005
distinction.
Because if I just am my body,

00:33:44.005 --> 00:33:50.846
then well, I'm just my body.
My death occurs at the death of

00:33:50.846 --> 00:33:53.198
my body.
But still, even the body

00:33:53.198 --> 00:33:55.380
theorist needs a different
distinction.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:57.903
We already learned,
by thinking about the corpse

00:33:57.903 --> 00:34:01.340
case, that existence wasn't good
enough for the body theorist.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:05.503
He wanted to be alive.
And when I think about Phase D,

00:34:05.503 --> 00:34:09.711
I want to say something more.
It's not good enough that I'm

00:34:09.711 --> 00:34:13.530
alive.
I want to be a person.

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:19.195
So what matters to me isn't
just being alive,

00:34:19.195 --> 00:34:23.960
but being back here during
Phase B.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.130
So then it needs something like
the same distinction.

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:30.650
Not, my death versus my body's
death, but perhaps the death of

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:33.939
the person, if we could talk
that way, versus the death of

00:34:33.939 --> 00:34:36.428
the body.
My death, for the body view,

00:34:36.428 --> 00:34:38.539
occurs with the death of my
body.

00:34:38.539 --> 00:34:43.682
But in terms of what matters,
it's the death of the person

00:34:43.682 --> 00:34:46.929
and that's star one,
not star two.

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:49.954
Now, I want to take just a
couple of minutes and mention

00:34:49.954 --> 00:34:53.117
some other puzzles,
or at least questions,

00:34:53.117 --> 00:34:58.409
worth thinking about in terms
of the physicalist picture.

00:34:58.409 --> 00:35:00.809
I'm only going to point to
them, rather than explore them.

00:35:00.809 --> 00:35:05.500
But I've been focused on the
question about the end of life.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:10.619
We might ask as well,
what about the beginning?

00:35:10.619 --> 00:35:15.508
What should we say about Phase
A, when the body is turned on

00:35:15.508 --> 00:35:19.595
and functioning,
developing, but the brain has

00:35:19.595 --> 00:35:24.340
not yet gotten to the stage at
which it's turned on,

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.600
or perhaps it hasn't yet
become, well,

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.800
it's not doing person
functioning.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.270
It's not reasoning.
It's not communicating.

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:32.560
It's not thinking.
It's not aware.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:38.135
It's not conscious.
There's going to be some Phase

00:35:38.135 --> 00:35:41.894
A like that.
What should we say about that

00:35:41.894 --> 00:35:45.265
phase?
Do I exist during that phase or

00:35:45.265 --> 00:35:46.080
don't I?

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:57.822
Well, on the body view,
I suppose we should say I do

00:35:57.822 --> 00:36:00.980
exist.
Being a person is a phase.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:05.095
We happen to have,
in Phase A, the stage of my

00:36:05.095 --> 00:36:08.480
existence before I become a
person.

00:36:12.199 --> 00:36:15.721
Of course, if we take the
version of the body view that

00:36:15.721 --> 00:36:19.699
what I am, essentially--the
crucial body part--is my brain,

00:36:19.699 --> 00:36:23.159
then we really would have to
subdivide A into two parts:

00:36:23.159 --> 00:36:26.120
early A and late A.
In very, very early A,

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.880
the brain hasn't even developed
yet.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:34.666
It hasn't been constructed yet.
If I just am my brain,

00:36:34.666 --> 00:36:40.599
in effect, then early A,
I don't exist yet.

00:36:40.599 --> 00:36:44.248
Not until late A,
when the brain gets put

00:36:44.248 --> 00:36:49.750
together, that I start to exist.
There is something there.

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:54.341
It's my body,
but it's not me,

00:36:54.341 --> 00:36:57.392
in early A.
It seems sort of hard to

00:36:57.392 --> 00:36:59.460
believe, but maybe that's the
right thing to say.

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:01.618
In any event,
the fans of the personality

00:37:01.618 --> 00:37:04.965
theory shouldn't be laughing too
hard, because they're going to

00:37:04.965 --> 00:37:09.195
have to say something similar.
Remember, if you accept the

00:37:09.195 --> 00:37:13.100
personality theory,
follow the personality.

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:17.429
Don't got the same personality?
I cease to exist.

00:37:17.429 --> 00:37:20.469
That's why we said on the
personality theory,

00:37:20.469 --> 00:37:24.200
as we went ahead in time,
once the P-functioning

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.688
stops, I don't exist anymore.
That's what the personality

00:37:27.688 --> 00:37:30.052
theorist said.
But we can raise that same

00:37:30.052 --> 00:37:34.775
point going backwards.
When did I begin to exist on

00:37:34.775 --> 00:37:39.904
the personality theory?
Not until my continuing,

00:37:39.904 --> 00:37:44.139
evolving through time
personality started.

00:37:44.139 --> 00:37:48.524
And that certainly wasn't true
way back at the start of A,

00:37:48.524 --> 00:37:52.832
as the fertilized egg first
begins to split and multiply,

00:37:52.832 --> 00:37:58.524
subdivide and make organs.
It's a good long time till any

00:37:58.524 --> 00:38:03.150
kind of mental processing occurs
at all.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:07.908
So on the personality theory,
I did not exist when that

00:38:07.908 --> 00:38:12.930
fertilized egg came into being,
when the egg and the sperm

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:15.512
joined.
That's still not me,

00:38:15.512 --> 00:38:19.750
on the personality theory.
Clearly, these issues are

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:24.199
relevant for thinking about the
morality of abortion.

00:38:24.199 --> 00:38:27.727
I'm not going to pursue them
here, but you can see how they'd

00:38:27.727 --> 00:38:31.204
be relevant.
If we want to worry about when,

00:38:31.204 --> 00:38:35.571
if ever, is an abortion
justified, it might be worth

00:38:35.571 --> 00:38:39.168
getting clear on,
when do creatures like us

00:38:39.168 --> 00:38:41.010
start?
Interesting question,

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:42.810
but having noted it,
let me put it aside.

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:49.285
Ah, question.
Student: [inaudible]

00:38:49.285 --> 00:38:58.799
Professor Shelly Kagan:
The question was:

00:38:58.799 --> 00:39:11.349
Would it be plausible to say
that at the early phases of A,

00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:13.780
strictly speaking,
the body's not functioning,

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:16.427
because it's so utterly
dependent on help from the

00:39:16.427 --> 00:39:18.914
mother's body.
It needs the mother for

00:39:18.914 --> 00:39:22.340
respiration, for nutrients,
and so forth and so on.

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:25.518
That's a great question.
And it's the sort of question

00:39:25.518 --> 00:39:28.523
and the reason why I said I
wanted to glance in this

00:39:28.523 --> 00:39:30.880
direction without really going
there.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.862
That's a nice example of it.
We might wonder,

00:39:33.862 --> 00:39:38.887
just when should we say the
body functioning really does

00:39:38.887 --> 00:39:43.827
start?
How much independence does it

00:39:43.827 --> 00:39:45.991
take?
We could draw yet another

00:39:45.991 --> 00:39:48.929
picture of a different way a
life could come to an end.

00:39:48.929 --> 00:39:53.601
Imagine a body towards the end
of life, on life support

00:39:53.601 --> 00:39:55.671
machinery.
Do we want to say the body's

00:39:55.671 --> 00:39:59.070
functioning or not functioning?
Well, hard cases there.

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:01.405
So similarly,
there's going to be hard cases

00:40:01.405 --> 00:40:03.360
about the very,
very early stages.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.215
And although they're great
questions and I'm happy to

00:40:06.215 --> 00:40:09.346
discuss them with you further,
I don't want to pursue them

00:40:09.346 --> 00:40:12.043
here and now.
I want to point to a different

00:40:12.043 --> 00:40:15.570
question that--I think it's a
crucially important question.

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:19.186
My unwillingness to discuss
them isn't a matter of my

00:40:19.186 --> 00:40:22.873
judgment that they're
unimportant, just trying to keep

00:40:22.873 --> 00:40:27.860
at least roughly on track.
Come back to the end of life.

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:32.809
Think some more about Phase D
and ask.

00:40:32.809 --> 00:40:37.148
All right, so this is something
that's--If the personality

00:40:37.148 --> 00:40:40.317
function's been destroyed,
can't be recovered,

00:40:40.317 --> 00:40:42.557
can't be fixed,
but the rest of the bodily

00:40:42.557 --> 00:40:45.825
functioning is still going on.
The heart's pumping,

00:40:45.825 --> 00:40:48.610
the lungs are breathing and so
forth.

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:52.005
The body's able to digest food.
There we are in Phase D,

00:40:52.005 --> 00:40:54.476
in something like,
perhaps, persistent vegetative

00:40:54.476 --> 00:40:54.940
state.

00:40:59.519 --> 00:41:04.894
Now, imagine that we've got
somebody who needs a heart

00:41:04.894 --> 00:41:10.369
transplant or a kidney
transplant, liver transplant.

00:41:10.369 --> 00:41:14.484
And tissue compatibility tests
reveal this body's compatible,

00:41:14.484 --> 00:41:15.650
suitable donor.

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:25.964
Can we take it or not?
Well, you might have thought we

00:41:25.964 --> 00:41:27.989
answer that by asking "Am I
still alive?"

00:41:27.989 --> 00:41:30.468
Well, rip out the heart,
it's going to kill me,

00:41:30.468 --> 00:41:31.751
right?
So if I'm still alive,

00:41:31.751 --> 00:41:33.030
you can't do that sort of
thing.

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:37.829
It's killing me.
Well, if we take the

00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:40.395
personality theory,
we have to say,

00:41:40.395 --> 00:41:44.170
my body's still alive,
but I'm not still alive.

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:45.679
That's what we seem to want to
say.

00:41:45.679 --> 00:41:51.368
If I'm not still alive,
all we'd be killing isn't me,

00:41:51.368 --> 00:41:55.779
but my body.
So now we have to ask,

00:41:55.779 --> 00:42:00.360
who or what has the right to
life?

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:05.309
Do I have the right to
life, or does my body

00:42:05.309 --> 00:42:08.234
have the right to life?
Or we might say,

00:42:08.234 --> 00:42:10.119
look, certainly I have a right
to life.

00:42:10.119 --> 00:42:14.080
But is it also true that in
addition to me,

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:18.759
my body has a right to life?
Is there something immoral

00:42:18.759 --> 00:42:23.240
about removing the organs during
Phase D when the person is dead

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:27.010
and the only thing that's still
alive is the body?

00:42:30.179 --> 00:42:32.269
Don't be too quick to assume
the answer that's got to be

00:42:32.269 --> 00:42:35.822
yeah, it's still wrong.
After all, on the body view,

00:42:35.822 --> 00:42:38.889
I still exist when I'm a
corpse.

00:42:38.889 --> 00:42:40.930
But of course,
there's nothing wrong about

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:43.170
taking my heart,
even though I still exist.

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:47.035
After all, I'm a corpse.
Why not then say,

00:42:47.035 --> 00:42:50.076
similarly, even though my
body's still alive,

00:42:50.076 --> 00:42:54.500
nothing wrong about removing
the heart if the person is dead.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:43:01.390
At least, the personality view
opens the door to saying that.

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:03.690
What about the body view?
On the body view,

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:06.330
of course, I just am my body.
I'm still alive.

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:07.921
Now is it wrong?
Well...

00:43:07.921 --> 00:43:11.627
Just like, with the body view,
we wanted to say,

00:43:11.627 --> 00:43:15.570
"Being alive is not all it's
cracked up to be,"

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:18.230
the real question is not,
am I alive, on the body view?

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:23.269
An interesting question is,
"Am I still a person?"

00:43:23.269 --> 00:43:26.377
And indeed, although I'm alive
on the body view,

00:43:26.377 --> 00:43:30.302
I'm not still a person.
Maybe it's not so much that I

00:43:30.302 --> 00:43:33.280
have a right not to be
killed.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:38.615
Maybe I have a right not to be
depersonified,

00:43:38.615 --> 00:43:42.860
to have my personality
destroyed.

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:46.249
If that's the real right,
then again, there'd be nothing

00:43:46.249 --> 00:43:48.530
wrong with removing the heart in
D.

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:51.143
Well, again,
clearly, very,

00:43:51.143 --> 00:43:56.570
very important and very,
very complicated questions.

00:43:56.570 --> 00:44:01.809
But having gestured toward
them, I want to put them aside.

00:44:01.809 --> 00:44:07.440
Instead, I want to raise the
following question.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.611
So look, what I've just been
talking about for the last half

00:44:10.611 --> 00:44:13.460
hour or so is the fact that
we've got to get clear,

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:17.762
in thinking about the nature of
death, as to whether or not the

00:44:17.762 --> 00:44:21.925
crucial moment is the moment
when the personality functioning

00:44:21.925 --> 00:44:25.949
stops or the moment when the
bodily functioning stops.

00:44:25.949 --> 00:44:28.731
As we saw by thinking about the
abnormal case,

00:44:28.731 --> 00:44:32.070
these things can come apart and
we can have Phase D.

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:37.320
But in the normal case,
they happen at the same moment.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.214
And I've drawn a lot of
different distinctions about

00:44:39.214 --> 00:44:41.369
what would you say if you're a
personality theorist to deal

00:44:41.369 --> 00:44:43.094
with this?
What would you say if you're a

00:44:43.094 --> 00:44:46.435
body theorist to deal with this?
Having drawn all those

00:44:46.435 --> 00:44:49.642
distinctions,
I'm going to just ride

00:44:49.642 --> 00:44:53.489
roughshod over them and put them
aside.

00:44:53.489 --> 00:44:58.333
And let's just suppose that
we're dealing with the normal

00:44:58.333 --> 00:45:03.609
case, where the body functioning
stops at the same time as the

00:45:03.609 --> 00:45:08.340
personality functioning stops.
So what is death?

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:11.883
What's the moment of death?
What is it to die,

00:45:11.883 --> 00:45:16.189
on the physicalist view?
Well, at first glance,

00:45:16.189 --> 00:45:19.053
you might think the answer is,
look, you exist,

00:45:19.053 --> 00:45:21.996
you're alive,
whatever it is--;as I said,

00:45:21.996 --> 00:45:26.395
I'm just going to be loose now,
I'm going to put aside all the

00:45:26.395 --> 00:45:30.505
careful distinctions I just
drew--I'm still around as long

00:45:30.505 --> 00:45:33.389
as my body is
P-functioning.

00:45:33.389 --> 00:45:35.129
And when my body's not
P-functioning,

00:45:35.129 --> 00:45:38.054
I'm not still around.
Either I don't exist or I'm not

00:45:38.054 --> 00:45:41.593
alive or I'm not a person,
whichever precise way we have

00:45:41.593 --> 00:45:43.983
to put it.
That seems like the natural

00:45:43.983 --> 00:45:46.170
proposal for the physicalist to
make.

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:50.210
To be dead is to no longer be
P-functioning.

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:55.499
But that can't quite be right.
Because imagine,

00:45:55.499 --> 00:46:00.795
don't just imagine,
just remember what happened to

00:46:00.795 --> 00:46:07.818
you last night around 3:20 a.m.
Let's just suppose that at 3:20

00:46:07.818 --> 00:46:11.167
a.m.
you were asleep and indeed,

00:46:11.167 --> 00:46:15.540
you weren't dreaming.
You weren't thinking.

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.710
You weren't reasoning.
You weren't communicating.

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:21.610
You weren't remembering.
You weren't making plans.

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:25.373
You weren't being creative.
You were not engaged in

00:46:25.373 --> 00:46:29.029
P-functioning.
If we take this simple

00:46:29.029 --> 00:46:32.804
straightforward view and say
you're dead when you're not

00:46:32.804 --> 00:46:36.739
P-functioning anymore,
then you were dead,

00:46:36.739 --> 00:46:40.309
on and off and on and off,
last night.

00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:43.989
Well, that clearly doesn't seem
to be the right thing to say.

00:46:43.989 --> 00:46:49.225
So we're going to have to
revise the P-functioning

00:46:49.225 --> 00:46:53.245
or the end of
P-functioning theory of

00:46:53.245 --> 00:46:55.754
death.
We're going to have to revise

00:46:55.754 --> 00:46:58.658
that theory.
We're going to have to refine

00:46:58.658 --> 00:47:03.208
it to deal with the obvious fact
that you're not dead all the

00:47:03.208 --> 00:47:07.000
times when you're unconscious
and not dreaming.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.157
But refining in just the right
way is going to turn out to be a

00:47:10.157 --> 00:47:13.315
surprisingly not straightforward
matter, at least that's how it

00:47:13.315 --> 00:47:14.944
seems to me.
At any rate,

00:47:14.944 --> 00:47:18.000
that's the question we'll turn
to next time.

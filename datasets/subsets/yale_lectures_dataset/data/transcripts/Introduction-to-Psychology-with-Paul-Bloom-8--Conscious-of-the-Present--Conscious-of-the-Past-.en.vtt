00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.129
Professor Paul Bloom:
I'll begin the class officially

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.630
with a different sort of
demonstration.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.559
I want to just show you one of
the change-blindness studies

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:23.530
that has been done in the real
world.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.850
And these videotapes are not
available publicly.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.500
We get them from the web and
see them as little Java scripts.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.771
So, this is one of the first
studies done by Dan Simons when

00:00:41.771 --> 00:00:45.520
he was at Cornell.
And his adviser at the time was

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.860
our Frank Keil,
who's now in our department.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.850
So, here's the study.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.730
[laughter]
And you don't notice it.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.589
Change blindness is one of the
more striking phenomena

00:01:15.589 --> 00:01:21.000
discovered by laboratory
scientists and by psychologists.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.653
But it's important to realize,
to get away from the sort of

00:01:24.653 --> 00:01:28.495
surprise of the gorilla and the
fact that it's hard to see the

00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:31.330
flickering--the object that's
flickering,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.983
and appreciate the big moral of
this, because the big moral of

00:01:33.983 --> 00:01:36.593
this is actually,
I think, striking and quite

00:01:36.593 --> 00:01:40.186
important.
You think right now that you're

00:01:40.186 --> 00:01:43.947
perceiving the world.
I look down on you and I think

00:01:43.947 --> 00:01:46.480
I have a whole sense of where
everybody is.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.519
I can't see everybody perfectly
in back.

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:52.685
You're kind of far away and
blurry but there's a sense in

00:01:52.685 --> 00:01:57.564
which I have a world around me.
Similarly, if I'm to close my

00:01:57.564 --> 00:02:01.493
eyes for a second,
everything just remains and I

00:02:01.493 --> 00:02:06.510
could sort of remember some of
the things that are there.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.990
That's really good sound
localization by me .

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.406
So you're looking up and you
think you have a sense of the

00:02:13.406 --> 00:02:16.349
world both in perception and
memory.

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.250
The change-blindness experiment
suggested this isn't true.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.846
The change-blindness experiment
suggests that if you look at me

00:02:23.846 --> 00:02:28.073
for a second and during that
second all of your classmates

00:02:28.073 --> 00:02:31.382
change positions,
including those next to you,

00:02:31.382 --> 00:02:33.759
you are extremely unlikely to
notice.

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:37.020
The change-blindness experiment
suggests that if you turn your

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.280
eyes away from me towards there
for a second and turn back,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.284
and I'm dressed entirely
differently, you wouldn't

00:02:44.284 --> 00:02:46.600
notice.
The exceptions would be if you

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.340
told yourself consciously,
"Remember what this guy is

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.672
wearing;
he's wearing this,

00:02:50.672 --> 00:02:53.764
that and the other."
But if you don't do it

00:02:53.764 --> 00:02:59.199
consciously you'll lose it,
and usually this is okay.

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:03.038
Usually, it's okay because your
memory and your visual system

00:03:03.038 --> 00:03:05.789
exploits a basic fact about the
universe,

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:09.319
which is that most things stay
the same most of the time.

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.031
I don't have to explicitly
remember that you're over there

00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:17.133
when I turn my head for a second
because you'll be over there in

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:19.770
any case.
You don't need to hold precise

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.911
representations of the world.
And so you only notice it in

00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:28.149
certain clever circumstances.
One sort of clever circumstance

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:30.646
is when psychologists change
reality as in the

00:03:30.646 --> 00:03:34.520
change-blindness studies.
A second sort of circumstance

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.777
is in movies.
So, one of the big surprises

00:03:37.777 --> 00:03:42.129
when people started making
movies involving cuts was it is

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.710
extremely difficult to get
everything continuously right.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.120
And you need to work very hard
to notice.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.198
So, there's all of these
continuity errors that creep up

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:55.724
into movies and you have to be a
film buff or writing it down to

00:03:55.724 --> 00:03:59.384
even notice this.
And the overall moral here then

00:03:59.384 --> 00:04:03.792
is that your perception of
reality is a lot more sparse,

00:04:03.792 --> 00:04:07.800
a lot more limited,
than you might think it is.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.530
So, this is where we were at
the end of last class.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.546
We were talking about the
different sorts of memories:

00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:17.050
Sensory memory,
which is the sort of fraction

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.521
of a second of sensory residue
of what you're hearing and what

00:04:20.521 --> 00:04:22.805
you're seeing,
working memory,

00:04:22.805 --> 00:04:26.319
short-term memory,
and then long-term memory.

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:29.553
And we talked last class about
how things get into sensory

00:04:29.553 --> 00:04:32.560
memory, into working memory,
the role of attention.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.812
And in fact,
the change-blindness studies

00:04:34.812 --> 00:04:38.360
are actually just studies of how
something gets from your senses

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.569
to your consciousness and what
does and what doesn't.

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:45.515
Now I want to move to the
distinction between working

00:04:45.515 --> 00:04:49.310
memory, short-term memory,
and long-term memory.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.197
Now, the obvious distinction is
actually just in fact--is

00:04:55.197 --> 00:05:01.125
storage differences.
So, long-term memory or "LTM"

00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:06.596
has a huge storage capacity.
This is your memory like the

00:05:06.596 --> 00:05:09.917
hard drive of your computer.
This is the memory you walk

00:05:09.917 --> 00:05:12.598
around with.
It includes all the words in

00:05:12.598 --> 00:05:15.970
English, just for example,
60 to 80,000 words.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.375
It includes everybody you've
ever met, languages,

00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:24.138
faces, stories,
locations, nursery rhymes,

00:05:24.138 --> 00:05:28.220
songs, TV programs.
Nobody knows the storage.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.734
It is not true that you
remember everything that has

00:05:31.734 --> 00:05:34.988
ever happened to you.
There's no reason to believe

00:05:34.988 --> 00:05:37.725
that this is true.
At the same time though,

00:05:37.725 --> 00:05:41.403
you have a huge amount stored
in your brain in long-term

00:05:41.403 --> 00:05:45.617
storage and nobody actually--It
has to be limited because it's a

00:05:45.617 --> 00:05:47.570
finite,
limited brain.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.866
But nobody knows how big it is.
Nobody knows how many terabytes

00:05:52.866 --> 00:05:56.870
you carry around in your brain
and--but it's a lot.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.878
Compare this to working memory
– the short-term memory,

00:06:00.878 --> 00:06:05.017
which is actually very limited.
Your memory of what you could

00:06:05.017 --> 00:06:08.694
store on--in--where you could
hold in consciousness right now

00:06:08.694 --> 00:06:12.430
is quite limited.
Here is an exercise.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.129
Do not write these things down.
I want you to remember them.

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:28.256
I'm just going to give you a
few numbers: 14,59,

00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:36.355
11,109, 43,58,
98,487, 25,389,

00:06:36.355 --> 00:06:40.350
54.
Please write them down.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.830
View this as an IQ test if that
would relax you.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:16.360
How many of you who decided to
participate in this experiment

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.890
got three or less?
Good.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:25.199
Good.
Four, five, six,

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:33.600
seven, eight,
nine or more?

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.579
Anybody get all eleven?
This is a particularly

00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:42.629
difficult memory task.
The numbers are meaningless.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:45.210
And I told--and I forgot to
tell you to get your pen and

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.181
pencil ready,
so some of you just glared at

00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:48.608
me.
But [laughter]

00:07:48.608 --> 00:07:53.235
under normal circumstances the
cognitive psychologist George

00:07:53.235 --> 00:07:57.628
Miller said that this sort of
suggested that the standard

00:07:57.628 --> 00:08:01.550
memory storage of short-term
memory is seven,

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:06.148
plus or minus two.
And what that means is anywhere

00:08:06.148 --> 00:08:09.725
from five to nine roughly.
Some of you,

00:08:09.725 --> 00:08:13.715
I bet, can beat that.
Some of you on a not-so-good

00:08:13.715 --> 00:08:16.810
day maybe won't make it that
much.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.040
Now "seven plus or minus two"
is what you--;so,

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.850
that's what you hold in
consciousness.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26.512
I can tell you 14,21.
You walk around,

00:08:26.512 --> 00:08:29.067
"Oh, yeah, 14,21."
You hold that in consciousness

00:08:29.067 --> 00:08:31.415
with no problem.
But I throw eleven numbers at

00:08:31.415 --> 00:08:33.159
you, you can't.
Some dribble out.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:36.277
You can't hold that in your
conscious window in your

00:08:36.277 --> 00:08:40.338
short-term memory.
Now, this raises the question

00:08:40.338 --> 00:08:46.163
"seven plus or minus two" what?
And the answer seems to be what

00:08:46.163 --> 00:08:51.502
George Miller calls "chunks."
And a chunk is a basic memory

00:08:51.502 --> 00:08:57.250
unit, something you think of as
a single, individual entity.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:01.643
So, suppose you see the string
of letters "L,

00:09:01.643 --> 00:09:03.940
A, M, A, I, S,
O, N."

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:08.190
If you don't know--If you can't
form these into words and you

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.590
have to remember them,
these are eight chunks.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.830
You have to just pick them up
separately.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.846
On the other hand,
if you break them up into four

00:09:17.846 --> 00:09:22.029
words you could just remember it
as four chunks.

00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:26.246
And if you break it up into two
words in French,

00:09:26.246 --> 00:09:31.269
"la maison," "the house," it
could just be one or two.

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:34.879
How much you know
depends--affects how much you

00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:39.116
memorize--how much you could
store in memory because it

00:09:39.116 --> 00:09:43.039
affects what counts as a basic
unit of memory.

00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:45.539
And there's all sorts of
examples of this.

00:09:45.539 --> 00:09:48.783
If I tell you "1,1,
0,1, 1,0, 0,1,

00:09:48.783 --> 00:09:54.484
0,1, 1,0," those of you who
don't know binary numbers might

00:09:54.484 --> 00:10:00.590
have to remember that as "1,
1,0, 0," whatever I said.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.356
Those of you who are computer
scientists or mathematicians or,

00:10:04.356 --> 00:10:07.134
for whatever reason,
know binary numbers could

00:10:07.134 --> 00:10:09.790
convert it into a single binary
number.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:17.100
Anybody know what the number is?
No, I cannot say it again.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.506
[laughter]
Some number,

00:10:18.506 --> 00:10:22.600
24, or not 24--to some number,
24, and then you remember "24."

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.845
It's easier.
Suppose you see a chessboard

00:10:25.845 --> 00:10:30.350
and the chessboard is set up and
you don't know how to play

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.406
chess.
It is murderously hard to

00:10:32.406 --> 00:10:34.190
remember that.
They've done the experiments.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.599
They've taken people in a lab
who don't know how to play

00:10:36.599 --> 00:10:38.182
chess.
They set up a chessboard and

00:10:38.182 --> 00:10:39.150
then they say,
"Okay.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:43.212
Look at this for five minutes."
Then they take it away,

00:10:43.212 --> 00:10:46.929
set it up again,
and it's murderously hard.

00:10:46.929 --> 00:10:50.720
"There is a horse-y thing on
the side there and everything."

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.877
But if these chess pieces are
set up in some way that's

00:10:54.877 --> 00:10:59.240
logical for a chess player,
then a chess master could look

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.080
at it and remember it in a
glance, "Oh.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.432
It's the Fibonacci defense" or
something like that [laughs],

00:11:06.432 --> 00:11:08.940
and then immediately recover
it.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.425
Similarly, football coaches
have been tested on their

00:11:12.425 --> 00:11:15.807
memories of football diagrams.
And they have a photographic

00:11:15.807 --> 00:11:18.460
memory for football diagrams
because it corresponds to things

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.983
that make sense.
Architects could have a

00:11:20.983 --> 00:11:24.351
photographic memory,
a perfect memory for floor

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:27.280
plans because it makes sense to
them.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.549
They understand it.
And so the way you store things

00:11:32.549 --> 00:11:36.109
in memory, and this is a theme
we're going to return to when we

00:11:36.109 --> 00:11:40.120
get to long-term memory,
depends in a large extent on

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:45.503
how much you understand it.
And this shows up in expertise

00:11:45.503 --> 00:11:48.757
effects.
Now, this is what's happening

00:11:48.757 --> 00:11:53.429
so far in short-term memory,
how much you hold in there.

00:11:53.429 --> 00:11:56.470
The question is how do you get
it into long-term memory?

00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:00.700
So, you have long-term memory,
your major storage system.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:06.297
How does information get from
your consciousness to long-term

00:12:06.297 --> 00:12:08.355
storage?
Well, there's one

00:12:08.355 --> 00:12:12.259
thing--there's one way which
sort of works sometimes but not

00:12:12.259 --> 00:12:14.967
very well.
And it's called "maintenance

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:17.587
rehearsal."
Suppose I said you have to

00:12:17.587 --> 00:12:20.820
remember this number,
this string of numbers.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.866
And if you remember it in
twenty minutes you will get one

00:12:23.866 --> 00:12:27.061
thousand dollars.
And the string is my phone

00:12:27.061 --> 00:12:32.643
number when I was a kid.
I'll include the area code:

00:12:32.643 --> 00:12:35.831
514-688-9057.
Now, if you tell that to a

00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:38.046
four-year-old,
well, the four-year-old will

00:12:38.046 --> 00:12:40.692
say, "I'll remember it."
And then you ask them,

00:12:40.692 --> 00:12:43.200
"What did I just say?"
"Well, I don't know."

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.383
If you tell it to an--because
you know something--If a lot

00:12:46.383 --> 00:12:49.120
depended on it,
you would know to do something.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.018
What you would do is you'd say
to yourself, "514-688-9057,51

00:12:53.018 --> 00:12:56.784
4-688-9057,514-688 --" You'd
rehearse it in your head over

00:12:56.784 --> 00:13:00.007
and over again.
The problem is you could hold

00:13:00.007 --> 00:13:04.669
it as long as you can do that.
It's like these movies.

00:13:04.669 --> 00:13:07.754
You see this all the time,
like an episode of 24:

00:13:07.754 --> 00:13:11.120
"Jack, call CTU and tell them
Agent 11 is trapped in a--" And

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.429
I can't even remember this but
the way to remember it is you

00:13:14.429 --> 00:13:17.850
hold--you've just got to repeat
it over and over again in your

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.755
head.
But this will not typically get

00:13:20.755 --> 00:13:25.290
things into long-term memory.
To get things into long-term

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.850
memory, rehearsal is usually not
enough.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:34.443
You need to do other things.
Typically, what you need is

00:13:34.443 --> 00:13:39.846
structure and organization.
And one way to demonstrate this

00:13:39.846 --> 00:13:42.785
was in a classic "depth of
processing" experiment which

00:13:42.785 --> 00:13:45.723
nicely illustrates the fact that
the more you structure

00:13:45.723 --> 00:13:48.527
something,
the deeper you think about it,

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:52.169
the better it gets entrenched
in the long-term memory.

00:13:52.169 --> 00:13:55.760
So, in this study what they did
was they asked people--they told

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.179
people that there's going to be
words flashed on a screen.

00:13:59.179 --> 00:14:02.670
And all of the subjects saw the
same strings of words.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:06.715
There were forty-eight words.
They were not told to memorize

00:14:06.715 --> 00:14:09.877
the words.
One third of the subjects was

00:14:09.877 --> 00:14:12.377
told, "Look.
Some of these words are going

00:14:12.377 --> 00:14:15.046
to come out in capital letters,
some of them not capital

00:14:15.046 --> 00:14:17.259
letters.
Press a button for capitals,

00:14:17.259 --> 00:14:19.220
non-capitals."
"Sure."

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.968
The other group was told,
"Some of these words will rhyme

00:14:22.968 --> 00:14:26.492
with 'train,' Others won't.
Press a button if it rhymes in

00:14:26.492 --> 00:14:28.567
'train'."
The third group was told,

00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:32.343
"Does it fit into the sentence
‘The girl placed the blank on

00:14:32.343 --> 00:14:34.330
the table'?
Press a button if it does.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.233
Press a button if it doesn't."
Then they were asked as a

00:14:38.233 --> 00:14:41.320
surprise, "What words did you
see?"

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.169
And the findings looked like
this.

00:14:43.169 --> 00:14:47.569
When they were asked to focus
on just what the word looked

00:14:47.569 --> 00:14:50.964
like, memory was very poor,
the sound better,

00:14:50.964 --> 00:14:54.604
the meaning better.
If you want to remember

00:14:54.604 --> 00:14:58.739
something, the best way to
remember it is to give it

00:14:58.739 --> 00:15:03.216
meaning, to give it sense.
This is illustrated through a

00:15:03.216 --> 00:15:06.663
very ancient technique,
which is that the way to

00:15:06.663 --> 00:15:10.623
remember things that are
otherwise arbitrary is to give

00:15:10.623 --> 00:15:14.289
them some organization through
memory tricks,

00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:21.799
through vivid imagery or songs
or poetry.

00:15:21.799 --> 00:15:24.730
And there's a lot of examples
of this.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.474
Do you know how to remember
that the hippocampus--There's a

00:15:27.474 --> 00:15:29.509
part of the brain called the
hippocampus.

00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:33.581
This is the worst memory trick
ever but it will stick with you

00:15:33.581 --> 00:15:36.852
for twenty years.
The hippocampus is involved in

00:15:36.852 --> 00:15:40.367
spatial memory.
It's involved in finding your

00:15:40.367 --> 00:15:43.164
way around.
Think to yourself,

00:15:43.164 --> 00:15:48.123
"The way I find my way around
campus is through the

00:15:48.123 --> 00:15:50.304
hippocampus."
And you think,

00:15:50.304 --> 00:15:52.766
"Well, that's stupid," but
you'll never forget now that the

00:15:52.766 --> 00:15:54.720
hippocampus is in charge of
spatial memory.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.720
It's going to be all you retain
from this course.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:03.062
Memory books on how to remember
people's names usually try to

00:16:03.062 --> 00:16:08.875
exploit this sort of thing when
you try to get poetry or

00:16:08.875 --> 00:16:12.576
dramatic images.
So, the memory books always

00:16:12.576 --> 00:16:16.042
typically involve somebody--like
you meet somebody with very

00:16:16.042 --> 00:16:18.333
spiky hair and they say,
"My name is Mr.

00:16:18.333 --> 00:16:21.270
Fish" and then you
remember--you think of their--of

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.620
a big fish impaled on their
hair.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.710
And then whenever you see them
you remember their name.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:30.258
It only really works for names
like "Fish" but [laughter]

00:16:30.258 --> 00:16:33.299
the idea is you try to generate
vivid imagery.

00:16:33.299 --> 00:16:37.694
When stuck with a situation
where you have to remember ten

00:16:37.694 --> 00:16:42.012
letters, turn it into a song
where--or a dirty poem where

00:16:42.012 --> 00:16:45.789
each of the letters is the first
words of it.

00:16:45.789 --> 00:16:49.437
When having to remember
something that seems totally

00:16:49.437 --> 00:16:53.585
arbitrary, try to figure out a
grand and obscene image that

00:16:53.585 --> 00:16:57.341
will come to mind easily.
And this is how--these are one

00:16:57.341 --> 00:17:00.779
way to get things into memory.
At a deep level though,

00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:05.065
the way to get things into
memory, and this applies to this

00:17:05.065 --> 00:17:07.799
course no less than anything
else,

00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:10.880
is by understanding
the--understanding it.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.910
I'm going to read you something
and I want you to try your best

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.048
to remember what I tell you.
These are not going to be

00:17:18.048 --> 00:17:21.094
strings of numbers.
These are going to be--This is

00:17:21.094 --> 00:17:24.514
going to be a series of
sentences: "A newspaper is

00:17:24.514 --> 00:17:27.848
better than a magazine.
A seashore is a better place

00:17:27.848 --> 00:17:30.376
than the street.
At first it is better to run

00:17:30.376 --> 00:17:32.410
than to walk.
You may have to try several

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:33.928
times.
It takes some skill but it's

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:36.204
easy to learn.
Even young children can enjoy

00:17:36.204 --> 00:17:37.579
it.
Once successful,

00:17:37.579 --> 00:17:41.950
complications are minimal.
Birds seldom get too close.

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:45.059
Rain, however,
soaks in very fast.

00:17:45.059 --> 00:17:48.020
Too many people doing the same
things can also cause problems.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.469
One needs lots of room.
If there are no complications,

00:17:51.469 --> 00:17:54.497
it can be very peaceful.
Finally, a rock will serve as

00:17:54.497 --> 00:17:57.619
an anchor.
If things break loose from it,

00:17:57.619 --> 00:18:01.400
however, you will not have a
second chance."

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:08.705
And here is what I said .
This is murderously hard to

00:18:08.705 --> 00:18:14.289
remember.
Now try it.

00:18:14.289 --> 00:18:21.634
Knowing what this is about,
being able to put a context to

00:18:21.634 --> 00:18:27.820
it helps the memory and helps it
come to mind.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.348
[laughter] Okay.
So, this is about how to get

00:18:31.348 --> 00:18:33.760
memory--how to get information
into your memory.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:39.470
How do you get information out?
So, it's exam period.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.970
You got the stuff presumably
into your head.

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.370
You have to get it out.
You have to retrieve it.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.510
There is a court case.
You have to figure out--You

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.509
have to recount the crime that
you witnessed.

00:18:51.509 --> 00:18:55.690
You see somebody and you want
to know his or her name.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.620
And you heard it;
you just have to get it out.

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:02.600
Well, how do you do that?
Well, there's "retrieval cues."

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.311
Retrieval cues make sense.
Retrieval cues are just things

00:19:07.311 --> 00:19:13.435
that have been associated with
what you--what you're trying to

00:19:13.435 --> 00:19:15.915
remember.
If I have to remember to

00:19:15.915 --> 00:19:18.414
replace the windows,
when I walk in to my living

00:19:18.414 --> 00:19:21.550
room and see that a window is
cracked that will remind me to

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:25.068
replace the windows.
If I had a lunch date with you

00:19:25.068 --> 00:19:27.621
and forgot about it,
when I see you,

00:19:27.621 --> 00:19:29.787
"Oh, yeah.
We were supposed to get

00:19:29.787 --> 00:19:33.642
together to have lunch."
Retrieval cues bring things

00:19:33.642 --> 00:19:38.799
back but it's a little bit more
complicated than that.

00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:41.918
There's a more general
relationship between encoding

00:19:41.918 --> 00:19:45.160
and retrieval called the
"compatibility principle."

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:49.281
And what this means is you're
much better to remember

00:19:49.281 --> 00:19:53.720
something in the context in
which you have learned it.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.160
And this is also known as
"context-dependent memory" and

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.819
"state-dependent memory."
It's illustrated by one of the

00:20:00.819 --> 00:20:04.759
strangest experiments in the
history of psychology where they

00:20:04.759 --> 00:20:08.239
had people on a boat and then
they had them scuba dive

00:20:08.239 --> 00:20:10.862
underwater.
And they taught them things

00:20:10.862 --> 00:20:14.590
either on the boat or underwater
with things that they held up.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:18.834
And then they tested them later.
And it turns out that you'll

00:20:18.834 --> 00:20:22.551
remember it better if you're
tested on it in the context in

00:20:22.551 --> 00:20:25.561
which you learned it.
And it might be because then

00:20:25.561 --> 00:20:27.610
the retrieval cues help bring it
back.

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:31.734
But it's more general than that.
If you have to remember

00:20:31.734 --> 00:20:35.484
something you learned in this
class, you will do better if you

00:20:35.484 --> 00:20:39.049
try to think about the room in
which you learned it in.

00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:42.976
You will do better on your
final exam if you were to take

00:20:42.976 --> 00:20:47.043
it in this room than if you were
to take it in another room

00:20:47.043 --> 00:20:50.970
because being in this room will
bring back the cues.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:55.180
It's not just the environment.
People who learn things when

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:59.253
they're stoned remember them
better--keeping stoned at a sort

00:20:59.253 --> 00:21:02.443
of a low-level that doesn't
disrupt other mental

00:21:02.443 --> 00:21:06.448
activities--remember them better
when they're sort of stoned

00:21:06.448 --> 00:21:09.910
again [laughter]
than if they're non-stoned.

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:13.510
Similarly--So,
if you study while you drink

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:18.568
you should tipple a little bit
before coming in to the Final

00:21:18.568 --> 00:21:19.839
exam.
[laughter]

00:21:19.839 --> 00:21:22.789
It's sort of like the "what
happens in Vegas stays in Vegas"

00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:24.916
sort of result.
And so, similarly,

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:28.937
it even applies to moods in
that if you learn something when

00:21:28.937 --> 00:21:32.685
depressed you have a slightly
better recovery of it when

00:21:32.685 --> 00:21:36.365
you're in that same mood of
depression than when you're

00:21:36.365 --> 00:21:39.651
elated.
And the idea is that part of

00:21:39.651 --> 00:21:44.563
what memory is--part of what
recovering memory is is getting

00:21:44.563 --> 00:21:49.059
back your original context in
which you learned it.

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:54.282
"Elaborative rehearsal" and
retrieval involves the

00:21:54.282 --> 00:21:58.440
connections between different
things.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:03.102
Elaborative rehearsal is that
the more you think about

00:22:03.102 --> 00:22:06.710
something the easier it is to
remember.

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:09.540
If you have to think about--If
you have to remember something,

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.860
try to connect it to as many
things as possible.

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.660
Think of an image.
Make a joke out of it.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.269
Imagine how you would explain
it to somebody else.

00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:22.402
Imagine how the world--what the
world would be like if it wasn't

00:22:22.402 --> 00:22:24.521
so.
And the idea is that this sort

00:22:24.521 --> 00:22:27.924
of thinking about it makes
connections in your memory from

00:22:27.924 --> 00:22:30.970
that thing you have to learn,
to other memories.

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:33.359
And so it makes it easier to
recover.

00:22:33.359 --> 00:22:39.771
"Elaborative retrieval" refers
to a finding that when you want

00:22:39.771 --> 00:22:45.763
to get something back out of
memory people tend to give up

00:22:45.763 --> 00:22:49.475
too soon.
It turns out that there's a lot

00:22:49.475 --> 00:22:54.089
of stuff that's in your memory
but it needs work to extract;

00:22:54.089 --> 00:22:58.650
it needs various sort of
searching strategies.

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:03.529
One study asked people who were
considerably older than you to

00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:06.730
remember their high school
classmates.

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.710
And in the first pass people
were terrible.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:11.540
Maybe they had a couple of
friends they kept in touch with.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.755
Otherwise, pretty bad.
And this is a good experiment

00:23:15.755 --> 00:23:18.190
because you could use high
school yearbooks to judge

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:19.910
whether or not they get it
right.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:22.304
But then what you do is you
tell the person,

00:23:22.304 --> 00:23:24.269
"Look.
Keep trying.

00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:28.039
Were you--What sort of--Who was
your teacher?

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:29.329
What sort of clubs did you
belong to?

00:23:29.329 --> 00:23:31.600
What sort of sports you--did
you participate in?

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.450
How did you get to school?
How did you get from school?

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:39.119
What did you do during lunch?
What did you do during break?"

00:23:39.119 --> 00:23:41.678
And you keep ask--"Do you
know--have any friends whose

00:23:41.678 --> 00:23:44.429
letter--whose last name began
with ‘B,' with ‘C,' with

00:23:44.429 --> 00:23:46.234
‘D'?"
And you keep pushing and

00:23:46.234 --> 00:23:49.291
pushing and pushing.
And over the span of time

00:23:49.291 --> 00:23:53.219
things come back.
Again, it's not true that you

00:23:53.219 --> 00:23:55.526
never forget.
There is honest to God

00:23:55.526 --> 00:23:58.145
forgetting but sometimes you
think you forget and it's

00:23:58.145 --> 00:24:00.220
because you haven't looked long
enough.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.941
There's a real physical notion
of searching for the right

00:24:03.941 --> 00:24:07.740
answer.
We've talked about retrieval.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:11.532
Oh.
Every class I've given somebody

00:24:11.532 --> 00:24:16.740
asks either in class or by
e-mail what about déjà vu?

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:22.440
And déjà vu is a feeling that
an event has happened before.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.193
So, you're looking at me and
I'm lecturing and you say,

00:24:25.193 --> 00:24:28.660
"I've heard this before.
I know this before."

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.276
You see somebody and say,
"I've been in this situation

00:24:31.276 --> 00:24:33.719
before."
This is not evidence for

00:24:33.719 --> 00:24:35.750
psychic powers,
[laughter]

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:40.218
which many people say it is,
but nobody really knows why

00:24:40.218 --> 00:24:43.340
this exists.
We know, and this is a clue,

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.640
it's worse with frontal lobe
damage.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.115
If you get damage to this part
of the brain,

00:24:48.115 --> 00:24:50.589
you get a lot more déjà vu
experiences.

00:24:50.589 --> 00:24:54.826
I asked some experts in memory,
including Marcia Johnson who is

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:58.448
chair of our department,
what the best explanation for

00:24:58.448 --> 00:25:01.607
déjà vu is.
And the answer she gave,

00:25:01.607 --> 00:25:05.019
the--say one big theory,
goes like this.

00:25:05.019 --> 00:25:08.380
Déjà vu is a feeling that
it's happened before.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.060
The answer is it has happened
before.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:16.379
It's happened half a second ago.
And so what happens is

00:25:16.379 --> 00:25:22.310
sometimes there is a glitch,
a disturbance in the force.

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.084
I don't know.
There's a glitch [laughter]

00:25:25.084 --> 00:25:28.582
and you are talking and then
something happens to you and you

00:25:28.582 --> 00:25:31.708
put it in your memory.
But it's as if you don't put

00:25:31.708 --> 00:25:34.329
the stamp on it of what time and
what date.

00:25:34.329 --> 00:25:38.334
So, you're talking to me and
then you store it in memory but

00:25:38.334 --> 00:25:42.000
you don't store it in memory as
happening right now.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.881
Then half a second goes by and
you're talking to me and you

00:25:44.881 --> 00:25:46.670
say, "This is strangely
familiar."

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:51.650
And that's one theory of what
goes on in déjà vu.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:54.003
Okay.
So far, there's the sort of

00:25:54.003 --> 00:25:57.706
good news – remembering –
but then there's bad news –

00:25:57.706 --> 00:26:00.111
forgetting.
How many people can remember,

00:26:00.111 --> 00:26:02.926
without looking down at your
notes, at least two of the

00:26:02.926 --> 00:26:04.490
numbers I gave you earlier?

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:12.050
How many people can remember at
least four?

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:16.109
Oh, impressive.
If I asked you in an hour,

00:26:16.109 --> 00:26:19.956
the number would go down.
These are sort of statistics in

00:26:19.956 --> 00:26:23.573
a similar experiment.
And this graph illustrates that

00:26:23.573 --> 00:26:27.930
people forget.
Over time, you'll forget.

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:31.519
Why do you forget?
Why is there forgetting at all?

00:26:31.519 --> 00:26:33.519
Well, there's different
explanations for this.

00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:38.050
One explanation is your brain's
a physical thing,

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:43.430
it's a physical piece of meat,
and it kind of goes bad.

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:47.222
Physical things decay.
And so, the memory traces that

00:26:47.222 --> 00:26:50.780
are laid onto your brain will
just decay over time.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:56.049
A second answer is interference.
So, remember those numbers?

00:26:56.049 --> 00:27:01.079
Here's a few more:
114,81, 66,42.

00:27:01.079 --> 00:27:04.947
Well, the more information that
comes in that's similar to the

00:27:04.947 --> 00:27:08.624
stuff you're trying to remember,
it blocks your recovery of

00:27:08.624 --> 00:27:12.321
original information.
So your ability to remember

00:27:12.321 --> 00:27:16.856
something can be impaired by
learning more things which are

00:27:16.856 --> 00:27:21.000
related to it because they get
confused in memory.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.660
Finally, and maybe this is most
interesting, there are changes

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.682
in retrieval cues.
So, the more time goes by the

00:27:27.682 --> 00:27:30.944
more the world changes.
And if your memory is to some

00:27:30.944 --> 00:27:34.029
extent dependent on cues
bringing it back to life,

00:27:34.029 --> 00:27:40.835
then the change in retrieval
cues can make it more difficult

00:27:40.835 --> 00:27:46.263
to recall certain things.
This leads to a puzzle where

00:27:46.263 --> 00:27:50.724
there's considerable scientific
debate over the case of

00:27:50.724 --> 00:27:54.268
childhood amnesia.
And the case of childhood

00:27:54.268 --> 00:27:58.463
amnesia is--doesn't refer to
when a child gets brain damage

00:27:58.463 --> 00:28:01.910
and gets amnesia.
What it refers to is people

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:05.910
have a difficult time recovering
very early memories.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:10.528
I want people to just take a
second and try to think back on

00:28:10.528 --> 00:28:14.990
what your first memory is and
roughly how old you were.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:25.750
How many people don't think you
have a first memory until you

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.890
were about five years old or
older?

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:33.220
Okay.
How many people think you have

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:37.509
the first memory of around age
four or younger?

00:28:37.509 --> 00:28:41.649
How many people think you have
the first memory of around age

00:28:41.649 --> 00:28:45.539
three or younger?
Two or younger?

00:28:45.539 --> 00:28:48.752
How many of you think you have
the first memory when you were

00:28:48.752 --> 00:28:52.867
about one years old or younger?
And I'm not asking about past

00:28:52.867 --> 00:28:56.430
lives but that [laughs]
happened last year.

00:28:56.430 --> 00:29:01.070
How old is your--roughly your
first memory do you think?

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:03.474
How old?
Student:

00:29:03.474 --> 00:29:05.272
Between one and two.
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:29:05.272 --> 00:29:08.390
Between one and two?
Anybody think they could beat

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.040
that?
Same guy?

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.390
Yeah.
Student: One.

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:16.460
Professor Paul Bloom:
One.

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:22.252
[laughter] Anybody else?
The literature is unclear on

00:29:22.252 --> 00:29:26.953
this because it's very difficult
to test people's recollections

00:29:26.953 --> 00:29:30.460
of their first memories.
If I'm to ask people about

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.650
their first memories,
they'll often say,

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:35.727
"Oh, yeah.
I remember I was in this room

00:29:35.727 --> 00:29:39.207
and there was a crib and I'm
going ‘Ga ga,

00:29:39.207 --> 00:29:42.930
goo goo' [laughter]
and I was on the potty.

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:44.950
I was walking.
I was so cute.

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:48.280
I remember it."
It's very difficult to tell

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.785
and, as we'll discuss in some
detail, there are a lot of

00:29:51.785 --> 00:29:55.800
reasons to distrust people when
they--not that they're lying but

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:59.049
to distrust the accuracy of
people's memories.

00:29:59.049 --> 00:30:04.226
We also know from studies about
trauma where people have

00:30:04.226 --> 00:30:08.650
terrible experiences when
they're one or two.

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:11.890
Typically, this trauma is not
remembered later on.

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:16.019
People know of trauma because
they're told about it but they

00:30:16.019 --> 00:30:19.380
don't typically remember it with
any accuracy.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:23.152
Even children--older children
don't remember back beyond that

00:30:23.152 --> 00:30:25.418
age.
Nobody knows why childhood

00:30:25.418 --> 00:30:28.295
amnesia occurs.
Nobody knows why it's very

00:30:28.295 --> 00:30:32.319
difficult to recover memories
before about the age of three.

00:30:32.319 --> 00:30:36.299
One theory is that the
retrieval cues change radically.

00:30:36.299 --> 00:30:39.339
I had a friend of mine who's a
clinical psychologist and he

00:30:39.339 --> 00:30:42.379
suggested a new form of therapy
where they make these giant

00:30:42.379 --> 00:30:45.577
tables and chairs and then they
bring you in to the office and

00:30:45.577 --> 00:30:48.459
you're standing there with these
giant tables and chairs

00:30:48.459 --> 00:30:50.608
[laughter]
and all these memories of being

00:30:50.608 --> 00:30:53.625
a baby would come flooding back.
[laughter]

00:30:53.625 --> 00:30:57.460
And he dropped out of the field
and-- [laughter]

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.480
Really, but it's such a cool
idea.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.730
Some people think language is
to blame.

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:08.205
So a child, a baby,
starts out with no spoken or

00:31:08.205 --> 00:31:11.956
signed language.
Language comes to be learned at

00:31:11.956 --> 00:31:15.044
around one, two,
and three, and it might be that

00:31:15.044 --> 00:31:18.460
the learning of a language
reformats your memory.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:22.164
And once the memory is
reformatted it can't go back to

00:31:22.164 --> 00:31:25.660
the previous state prior to
language in the end.

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:30.584
It could be neural maturation.
It could be that those memory

00:31:30.584 --> 00:31:34.662
parts of the brains grow around
age two or three that just

00:31:34.662 --> 00:31:39.049
weren't there prior to that.
And nobody really knows.

00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:44.523
It's a fascinating research
area why--about memory changes

00:31:44.523 --> 00:31:48.356
early on.
Another case of memory failure

00:31:48.356 --> 00:31:52.089
is brain damage.
And brain damage comes in a

00:31:52.089 --> 00:31:56.390
couple of flavors.
There is retrograde amnesia;

00:31:56.390 --> 00:32:00.555
"retro" for past.
Retrograde amnesia is when you

00:32:00.555 --> 00:32:04.161
lose some memory of the past.
This could be in a case where

00:32:04.161 --> 00:32:07.339
you get some sort of head trauma
and you lose memory of your

00:32:07.339 --> 00:32:09.734
entire episodic memory.
But typically,

00:32:09.734 --> 00:32:13.782
if you have any sort of serious
accident that involves you

00:32:13.782 --> 00:32:18.256
losing consciousness you'll have
a blackout of some period prior

00:32:18.256 --> 00:32:20.779
to that,
say, blow to the head.

00:32:20.779 --> 00:32:25.494
And the reason for this is as
you're having these experiences

00:32:25.494 --> 00:32:30.210
now they need to kind of get
consolidated into your brain.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:33.317
Your brain needs to rewire and
catch up to the experiences

00:32:33.317 --> 00:32:36.121
you're having.
A sudden blow to the head will

00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:40.050
knock you unconscious and then
the memories that have happened

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:44.042
immediately prior will not get
consolidated and they'll be lost

00:32:44.042 --> 00:32:46.710
forever.
Another sort of memory is

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:51.102
anterograde amnesia and this was
the case of--This happens in

00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:55.003
Korsakoff's syndrome.
It happens to a very famous

00:32:55.003 --> 00:32:58.680
patient known as H.M.
who actually lives in Hartford,

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.688
Connecticut.
And it happened to Clive

00:33:01.688 --> 00:33:05.170
Wearing, the film you saw last
class.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:10.134
And this sort of amnesia is a
sort of amnesia where you lose

00:33:10.134 --> 00:33:13.079
the ability to form new
memories.

00:33:13.079 --> 00:33:17.393
And so you live in a perpetual
present, unable to accumulate

00:33:17.393 --> 00:33:21.195
new memories.
But it's actually a little bit

00:33:21.195 --> 00:33:25.477
more complicated than that.
What happens is--And this was

00:33:25.477 --> 00:33:28.991
an exciting discovery about
these patients that led to some

00:33:28.991 --> 00:33:32.263
real insights about normal
memory--What happens is--And

00:33:32.263 --> 00:33:34.990
this is the brain damage in
these cases,

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:38.279
the temporal lobe and the
hippocampus, very useful for

00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:42.255
spatial memory you'll know.
One discovery made about people

00:33:42.255 --> 00:33:46.254
who couldn't form new memories
is that they could form new

00:33:46.254 --> 00:33:50.167
memories, but of certain types.
So for example,

00:33:50.167 --> 00:33:56.277
this is a task here involving
filling in a star while looking

00:33:56.277 --> 00:33:59.075
in to a mirror.
And if I asked you to do it

00:33:59.075 --> 00:34:01.949
you'd find it pretty difficult.
It's just kind of difficult to

00:34:01.949 --> 00:34:03.519
do.
You'd be clumsy at it.

00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:07.033
You bring in an amnesic who
can't form new memories and you

00:34:07.033 --> 00:34:09.789
say, "Hey.
I want you to try something new.

00:34:09.789 --> 00:34:11.530
I want you to try this star
game."

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:14.356
He'd say, "Okay.
I've never seen it before but

00:34:14.356 --> 00:34:15.530
I'll do it."
Tries it.

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:19.088
Does very badly.
You bring him in and over and

00:34:19.088 --> 00:34:23.372
over again--Each time he does it
he starts off by saying,

00:34:23.372 --> 00:34:27.849
"I've never seen this before.
I'll--I'm sure I'll give it a

00:34:27.849 --> 00:34:30.789
try" but he gets better and
better at it.

00:34:30.789 --> 00:34:33.570
And this is known as implicit
memory.

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:37.746
The claim is that in these
sorts of cases you lose the

00:34:37.746 --> 00:34:42.160
abilities to form explicit
conscious memories that you're

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:46.996
aware of, that you understand.
But some sorts of memories

00:34:46.996 --> 00:34:50.230
persist and you are able to form
them.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:54.096
This has actually been
illustrated in a couple of

00:34:54.096 --> 00:34:57.882
dramatic movies,
one of them a very bad dramatic

00:34:57.882 --> 00:35:01.426
movie [laughs]
where Drew Barrymore loses the

00:35:01.426 --> 00:35:06.501
ability to form new memories and
somehow falls in love with Adam

00:35:06.501 --> 00:35:08.311
Sandler.
[laughs]

00:35:08.311 --> 00:35:12.544
Definitely don't watch that.
But a very good movie called

00:35:12.544 --> 00:35:17.401
"Memento," which is about a
character who loses his ability

00:35:17.401 --> 00:35:22.175
to form new memories while
trying to track down his wife's

00:35:22.175 --> 00:35:24.837
killer.
"Memento" is a movie which is

00:35:24.837 --> 00:35:27.179
fascinating because it's told
backwards.

00:35:27.179 --> 00:35:30.229
But throughout "Memento"
there's another story told

00:35:30.229 --> 00:35:33.055
forwards.
And I like this story because

00:35:33.055 --> 00:35:37.588
it very dramatically illustrates
what does, and what is and is

00:35:37.588 --> 00:35:41.230
not impaired in cases of severe
memory damage.

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:44.006
So, I'm going to show you a
couple of clips that illustrate

00:35:44.006 --> 00:35:45.730
the disassociation from
"Memento."

00:35:49.389 --> 00:35:53.210
Those of you who have seen the
movie know that this ends up

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:58.079
quite tragically for Sammy.
I highly recommend the movie.

00:35:58.079 --> 00:36:02.050
We've dealt right now with two
sorts of failures of memory.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:06.139
One is everyday failure of
memory when you forget.

00:36:06.139 --> 00:36:13.545
How many of you remember three
or more of the numbers I

00:36:13.545 --> 00:36:17.860
originally presented?
Yeah?

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.772
Go ahead.
Student: [inaudible]

00:36:20.772 --> 00:36:23.230
Professor Paul Bloom:
Fourteen, 59,11.

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:28.330
Is that right?
[laughs] Fine.

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:34.861
[laughter] All right.
I'm going to ask you again in a

00:36:34.861 --> 00:36:36.299
month.
[laughter]

00:36:36.299 --> 00:36:38.816
Well, people are supposed to
forget [laughter]

00:36:38.816 --> 00:36:41.110
and some things will--you will
forget.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:45.402
That's normal forgetting.
A second case is forgetting due

00:36:45.402 --> 00:36:48.976
to brain damage.
Forgetting due to brain damage

00:36:48.976 --> 00:36:52.489
is exotic and unusual but it's
interesting in that it

00:36:52.489 --> 00:36:56.880
illustrates some more general
themes about how the mind works.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.733
Remember one theme of this
course is we're going to look at

00:37:00.733 --> 00:37:03.789
exotic cases like the case of
Clive Wearing,

00:37:03.789 --> 00:37:07.023
not just because they're
interesting in their own right

00:37:07.023 --> 00:37:10.256
but sometimes by looking at the
extremes we could learn

00:37:10.256 --> 00:37:13.070
something about how normal
people's normal,

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:19.845
intact minds and brains work.
The third case of forgetting is

00:37:19.845 --> 00:37:24.413
more interesting and it
actually--Well,

00:37:24.413 --> 00:37:28.739
I want to do a little trial
here.

00:37:28.739 --> 00:37:33.438
What I want to do is I want
to--You to listen to three

00:37:33.438 --> 00:37:37.250
children describe an event that
happened.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:40.269
I want you to come to
some--your own guess.

00:37:40.269 --> 00:37:44.015
Imagine you were a judge,
you were a childcare worker,

00:37:44.015 --> 00:37:48.114
you wanted to see--I want you
to be--come to your own guess

00:37:48.114 --> 00:37:51.929
about who you believe and what
you think happened.

00:37:51.929 --> 00:37:52.749
[inaudible]
[laughter]

00:37:52.749 --> 00:37:55.539
You've heard three children.
Who do you believe?

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:58.681
Who believes--There's three of
them, one, two,

00:37:58.681 --> 00:38:02.800
three.
Who believes the first one?

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:09.200
Who believes the second one?
Who believes the third one?

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.580
Sort of an even split.

00:38:18.539 --> 00:38:23.333
Twenty-three hundred experts
were shown these films and asked

00:38:23.333 --> 00:38:27.413
about the different actions,
whether or not the person

00:38:27.413 --> 00:38:29.770
ripped the book,
messed up the bear,

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:33.643
tossed the book in the air and,
as you could see,

00:38:33.643 --> 00:38:36.809
the majority thought that he
did.

00:38:36.809 --> 00:38:43.446
This is work done by Steve Ceci
who was gracious enough to lend

00:38:43.446 --> 00:38:48.050
me the film to use for teaching
purposes.

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:50.780
It turns out the second girl
was right.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:55.532
Absolutely nothing happened.
[laughter]

00:38:55.532 --> 00:38:58.156
The teacher said,
"There is somebody named Sam

00:38:58.156 --> 00:39:03.461
Stone who's going to come in."
A guy walks in and says,

00:39:03.461 --> 00:39:08.411
"Hi," walks around and leaves.
[laughter]

00:39:08.411 --> 00:39:11.722
The first and third children
had their memories implanted,

00:39:11.722 --> 00:39:14.570
not through any sort of science
fiction means.

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:17.088
They had their memories
implanted--Well,

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:20.059
they had their memories
implanted like this.

00:39:20.059 --> 00:39:23.139
Some of the children would just
ask questions.

00:39:23.139 --> 00:39:26.157
The interviewer,
by the way, was herself unaware

00:39:26.157 --> 00:39:29.367
of what happened so the
interviewer was a perfectly

00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:32.129
naive interviewer.
And it turns out if you just

00:39:32.129 --> 00:39:35.117
interview children and you ask
them questions about whether the

00:39:35.117 --> 00:39:36.900
book was ripped,
"Did you see him?

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:40.400
Did he really do it?"
they don't say anything.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.760
They didn't see anything and
they won't say anything.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.769
Other children were told about
Sam Stone.

00:39:47.769 --> 00:39:51.321
They were told a stereotype
about Sam Stone – that he's

00:39:51.321 --> 00:39:54.936
very clumsy and he tends to rip
things and he trips and he

00:39:54.936 --> 00:39:57.409
breaks things and he spills
things.

00:39:57.409 --> 00:39:59.242
And in fact,
the third child mentioned that

00:39:59.242 --> 00:40:02.050
in passing.
He said, "He always does that."

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:06.130
Just knowing this about Sam
Stone tends to raise the

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:09.329
proportion of kids who say,
for instance,

00:40:09.329 --> 00:40:13.964
that he ripped the book.
Other children were given

00:40:13.964 --> 00:40:16.590
suggestions.
They were given suggestive

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:19.959
questioning.
They were a series of leading

00:40:19.959 --> 00:40:21.900
questions like,
"Oh.

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:25.168
Sam Stone came in?
Did he rip a book while he was

00:40:25.168 --> 00:40:28.846
there?"
And still more children got

00:40:28.846 --> 00:40:30.555
both.
And in fact,

00:40:30.555 --> 00:40:34.159
the children you saw were from
this group.

00:40:34.159 --> 00:40:36.873
They heard Sam Stone being
described as a clumsy fellow and

00:40:36.873 --> 00:40:39.400
they were given a series of
suggestive questionings.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.526
In this condition they were
given several suggestive

00:40:42.526 --> 00:40:45.530
questionings over the period of
several months.

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:48.796
These children,
like the first child and the

00:40:48.796 --> 00:40:53.886
third child, are not lying.
They honestly believe that Sam

00:40:53.886 --> 00:40:57.349
Stone came in and did these
things.

00:40:57.349 --> 00:41:01.506
Also they believe it and
they're so convincing in their

00:41:01.506 --> 00:41:05.678
belief that experts,
including police officers and

00:41:05.678 --> 00:41:11.062
child caseworkers and judges and
lawyers, find these children to

00:41:11.062 --> 00:41:15.001
be extremely believable.
And I think they probably find

00:41:15.001 --> 00:41:18.210
them to be extremely believable
because the children are not

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:20.484
lying.
They really believe they saw

00:41:20.484 --> 00:41:23.097
what they saw.
But these memories were

00:41:23.097 --> 00:41:25.825
implanted.
And Ceci, and many other

00:41:25.825 --> 00:41:28.969
investigators,
study how memories can be

00:41:28.969 --> 00:41:33.565
implanted in people's minds
through suggestion and through

00:41:33.565 --> 00:41:37.705
leading questions.
It turns out that the same sort

00:41:37.705 --> 00:41:42.275
of experiments and the same sort
of research has been done with

00:41:42.275 --> 00:41:46.035
considerable success in
implanting false memories in

00:41:46.035 --> 00:41:49.142
adults.
There are dramatic cases of

00:41:49.142 --> 00:41:53.752
people remembering terrible
crimes and confessing to them

00:41:53.752 --> 00:41:57.210
when actually,
they didn't commit them.

00:41:57.210 --> 00:42:02.610
And this is not because they
are lying.

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:05.469
It's not even because they're,
in some obvious sense,

00:42:05.469 --> 00:42:07.780
deranged or schizophrenic or
delusional.

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:12.302
Rather, they have persuaded
themselves, or more often been

00:42:12.302 --> 00:42:16.348
persuaded by others,
that these things have actually

00:42:16.348 --> 00:42:19.212
happened.
Psychologists have studied in

00:42:19.212 --> 00:42:22.750
the laboratory how one could do
this, how one can implant

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:26.139
memories in other people.
And some things are sort of

00:42:26.139 --> 00:42:28.900
standard.
Suppose I was to tell you a

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:34.019
story about a trip I took to the
dentist or a visit I took to--or

00:42:34.019 --> 00:42:38.179
a time when I ate out at a
restaurant and I'm to omit

00:42:38.179 --> 00:42:41.524
certain details.
I omit the fact that I paid the

00:42:41.524 --> 00:42:44.102
bill in a restaurant,
let's say or I finished the

00:42:44.102 --> 00:42:48.024
meal and then I went home.
Still, you will tend to fill in

00:42:48.024 --> 00:42:50.542
the blanks.
You'll tend to fill in the

00:42:50.542 --> 00:42:53.505
blanks with things you know.
So, you might remember this

00:42:53.505 --> 00:42:54.420
later saying,
"Okay.

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:57.304
He told me he finished eating,
paid the bill and left,"

00:42:57.304 --> 00:43:00.350
because paying the bill is what
you do in a restaurant.

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:03.139
This is benign enough.
You fill in the blanks.

00:43:03.139 --> 00:43:11.739
You also can integrate
suppositions made by others.

00:43:11.739 --> 00:43:15.280
And the clearest case of this
is eyewitness testimony.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:18.653
And the best research on this
has been done by Elizabeth

00:43:18.653 --> 00:43:21.230
Loftus who has done a series of
studies,

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:25.597
some discussed in the textbook,
showing how people's memories

00:43:25.597 --> 00:43:28.290
can be swayed by leading
questions.

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:32.185
And it can be extremely subtle.
In one experiment,

00:43:32.185 --> 00:43:36.322
the person was just asked in
the course of a series of

00:43:36.322 --> 00:43:41.163
questions--shown a scene where
there's a car accident and asked

00:43:41.163 --> 00:43:43.639
either,
"Did you see a broken

00:43:43.639 --> 00:43:47.202
headlight?"
or "Did you see the broken

00:43:47.202 --> 00:43:50.132
headlight?"
The ‘the' presupposes that

00:43:50.132 --> 00:43:54.002
there was a broken headlight and
in fact, the people told--asked,

00:43:54.002 --> 00:43:56.300
"Did you see the broken
headlight?"

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:59.260
later on are more likely to
remember one.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.889
It creates an image and they
fill it in.

00:44:01.889 --> 00:44:05.474
In another study,
she would show film segments

00:44:05.474 --> 00:44:08.500
and then ask,
"Did you see the children

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:12.511
getting on the school bus?"
Now, there was no school bus

00:44:12.511 --> 00:44:15.428
but people who hear that
question later on when asked,

00:44:15.428 --> 00:44:17.740
"Did you see a school bus in
the film?"

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.390
are more likely to say yes.
In another study,

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:24.404
she would show people film
segments and ask them either,

00:44:24.404 --> 00:44:28.710
"How fast were the cars going
when they hit each other?"

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:34.729
or "How fast were the cars
going when they smashed into

00:44:34.729 --> 00:44:38.513
each other?"
A week later she'd bring people

00:44:38.513 --> 00:44:42.602
back in to the laboratory and
ask, "Did you see any broken

00:44:42.602 --> 00:44:45.285
glass?"
Those who hear a smash tend to

00:44:45.285 --> 00:44:49.346
see the broken glass more than
those who hear a hit because the

00:44:49.346 --> 00:44:51.769
question has changed their
memory,

00:44:51.769 --> 00:44:56.340
making it more of a dramatic
event.

00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:01.328
Hypnosis is the clearest case
where there's a sort of

00:45:01.328 --> 00:45:06.605
reconstructive effort led
by--led as a result of leading

00:45:06.605 --> 00:45:11.410
and probing questions.
Some of you are readily

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:15.429
hypnotizable and you can be
hypnotized.

00:45:15.429 --> 00:45:19.406
And what we would learn about a
past event from hypnotizing you

00:45:19.406 --> 00:45:22.099
will not necessarily then be
inaccurate.

00:45:22.099 --> 00:45:25.227
What hypnotizing does is it
makes people very willing to

00:45:25.227 --> 00:45:26.767
cooperate.
Unfortunately,

00:45:26.767 --> 00:45:30.134
it isn't as if there is a
memory storage there where you

00:45:30.134 --> 00:45:33.868
could just go through and look
as in the movies where you just

00:45:33.868 --> 00:45:35.530
say,
"What's the license plate?"

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:38.254
The person's hypnotized and
then the flashback comes in and

00:45:38.254 --> 00:45:40.180
then they zoom in on the license
plate.

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:43.984
Memory doesn't work that way.
What happens is--What somebody

00:45:43.984 --> 00:45:47.454
will do in a hypnotizable state
is they'll be very eager to

00:45:47.454 --> 00:45:50.909
please the hypnotist.
And so they'll make stuff up.

00:45:50.909 --> 00:45:54.010
And people under hypnosis just
make stuff up.

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:57.706
And they do very
enthusiastically and very

00:45:57.706 --> 00:46:01.750
believably make stuff up.
This is particularly the case

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:05.303
with hypnotic regression when we
ask you to go back to your sixth

00:46:05.303 --> 00:46:07.079
birthday party,
for instance.

00:46:07.079 --> 00:46:10.026
And what's great as a
developmental psychologist is if

00:46:10.026 --> 00:46:13.362
I ask you to go back to your
fourth birthday party and you're

00:46:13.362 --> 00:46:16.575
hypnotizable you'll be oh,
just like a four-year-old

00:46:16.575 --> 00:46:19.480
except you won't be like a real
four-year-old.

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.953
What you'll be like is an
adult's notion of what a

00:46:21.953 --> 00:46:25.883
four-year-old is supposed to be.
In fact, this has happened in

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:30.617
the extreme case with hypnotic
regression where people claim to

00:46:30.617 --> 00:46:33.900
speak languages like from
ancient Egypt.

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:36.546
And linguists love these
studies because you don't--of

00:46:36.546 --> 00:46:39.541
course you don't really sound
like you're speaking a language

00:46:39.541 --> 00:46:43.482
from ancient Egypt.
What you sound is like a North

00:46:43.482 --> 00:46:48.880
American who believes he's
speaking a language from ancient

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.510
Egypt so they're,
"nonsense sounds."

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:54.471
[laughter]
And so what it makes you

00:46:54.471 --> 00:46:57.010
is--Hypnotism brings out the
actor in you.

00:46:57.010 --> 00:47:01.018
It makes you want to give a
persuasive account of what

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:04.570
happened.
And so hypnotism is just an

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:10.920
extreme form of what normally
happens in eyewitness testimony.

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.865
Repressed memories.
We could devote a class--We

00:47:13.865 --> 00:47:18.446
could devote a semester to the
very heated debate in the United

00:47:18.446 --> 00:47:21.550
States mostly about repressed
memories.

00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:27.097
There are many adults who have
claimed to have experienced

00:47:27.097 --> 00:47:30.451
traumatic sexual abuse.
In some cases,

00:47:30.451 --> 00:47:33.809
this is unexceptional from a
memory point of view.

00:47:33.809 --> 00:47:35.349
People know this happened to
them.

00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:38.116
They've always known it happens
to them and then they tell

00:47:38.116 --> 00:47:41.215
people about it.
But there's a subset of cases

00:47:41.215 --> 00:47:45.895
where people have had no memory
up to a point of what happened

00:47:45.895 --> 00:47:48.717
to them.
Then they go to a psychologist

00:47:48.717 --> 00:47:52.133
or a psychiatrist;
they undergo questioning,

00:47:52.133 --> 00:47:54.989
often using hypnotic
techniques;

00:47:54.989 --> 00:47:59.949
and then they recover a memory
of past traumatic sexual abuse.

00:47:59.949 --> 00:48:02.687
And what this is--what makes
this so debatable,

00:48:02.687 --> 00:48:04.769
and there is a debate about
this.

00:48:04.769 --> 00:48:07.170
I don't want to try to preclude
it one way or another.

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:10.134
What makes this debatable is
some psychologists believe that,

00:48:10.134 --> 00:48:12.839
in at least some cases,
these memories are real and

00:48:12.839 --> 00:48:16.158
they have been repressed through
a Freudian mechanism – that

00:48:16.158 --> 00:48:18.880
they're too terrible to bring to
consciousness,

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:22.110
and the therapy brings them out
into real life.

00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:26.295
But most psychologists believe
that these memories cannot be

00:48:26.295 --> 00:48:30.693
trusted, that these memories are
created through the actions of

00:48:30.693 --> 00:48:33.650
the therapist.
And so, there's actually

00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:37.920
considerable psychological and
legal battles over the veracity

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:41.630
of the therapists where women
who have claimed to have

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:44.524
sexual--be sexually abused,
for instance,

00:48:44.524 --> 00:48:47.391
have pressed criminal charges
against their fathers on the

00:48:47.391 --> 00:48:50.617
basis of false memories.
Similarly, people who have been

00:48:50.617 --> 00:48:54.232
accused of sexual abuse have
pressed criminal charges against

00:48:54.232 --> 00:48:57.305
psychiatrists claiming that
these psychiatrists have

00:48:57.305 --> 00:49:00.800
implanted the memories into
their sons and daughters.

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:04.940
It is controversial whether
memories are ever repressed.

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:08.998
What isn't controversial is
that, for at least some cases,

00:49:08.998 --> 00:49:12.059
you can implant false memories
in people,

00:49:12.059 --> 00:49:15.329
not because you're a sinister
or evil person but because you

00:49:15.329 --> 00:49:17.380
really believed something
happened.

00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:20.544
And you talked to them about it
and then you caused these

00:49:20.544 --> 00:49:24.254
memories to come into being.
A final case is flashbulb

00:49:24.254 --> 00:49:26.238
memories.
I asked this early in the

00:49:26.238 --> 00:49:27.679
semester.
I'll ask it again.

00:49:27.679 --> 00:49:33.619
How many of you remember where
you were on September 11,2001?

00:49:33.619 --> 00:49:37.594
Is there anybody who doesn't
remember where they were on

00:49:37.594 --> 00:49:40.030
September 11,2001?
It would be interesting.

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:44.885
It was a socially relevant
event, but here's the problem

00:49:44.885 --> 00:49:49.453
with these flashbulb memories.
Flashbulb memories are the idea

00:49:49.453 --> 00:49:52.659
that these memories being so
vivid, and they are vivid for

00:49:52.659 --> 00:49:55.639
many of us--exactly where we
stood, what happened;

00:49:55.639 --> 00:49:58.950
well, they can't really be
trusted.

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:02.817
And here is why not.
Because they are such important

00:50:02.817 --> 00:50:07.115
events, I bet many of you have
actually heard the question

00:50:07.115 --> 00:50:10.810
before, "Where were you on
September 11^(th)?"

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:14.573
and talked about it.
What happens in these

00:50:14.573 --> 00:50:19.320
conversations is stories change.
I have my--I knew where I was

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:22.809
on September 11^(th).
My wife knew where she was.

00:50:22.809 --> 00:50:25.903
But I spent as much time
listening to her talk about it

00:50:25.903 --> 00:50:28.079
as I spent time me talking about
it.

00:50:28.079 --> 00:50:31.247
And now maybe my memory is
actually of her experience and

00:50:31.247 --> 00:50:34.144
not mine.
It's not--For all of these

00:50:34.144 --> 00:50:38.519
cases, the temptation you have
to resist is saying,

00:50:38.519 --> 00:50:41.969
"Yes.
I know memories can be swayed.

00:50:41.969 --> 00:50:45.075
I know they could be distorted
and everything but,

00:50:45.075 --> 00:50:47.800
you see, I really am sure that
happened."

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:50.906
You have to resist that
temptation because there are so

00:50:50.906 --> 00:50:53.782
many cases we know,
including the tape of the girls

00:50:53.782 --> 00:50:56.355
that we just saw,
where people are entirely sure

00:50:56.355 --> 00:50:59.134
things happened.
And we know full well that they

00:50:59.134 --> 00:51:02.491
didn't exist.
Being sure is no guarantee that

00:51:02.491 --> 00:51:05.812
a memory isn't false,
reconstructed or even

00:51:05.812 --> 00:51:09.240
implanted.
So, this part of memory has

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:12.254
three main morals.
There are many types of

00:51:12.254 --> 00:51:14.207
memories.
I talked about short-term

00:51:14.207 --> 00:51:17.598
memory, long-term memory.
I talked about implicit memory

00:51:17.598 --> 00:51:20.583
and explicit memory.
These are sort of separable

00:51:20.583 --> 00:51:22.597
sort of memories.
You could break one while

00:51:22.597 --> 00:51:25.672
having the other one impaired.
Arguably, there are brain

00:51:25.672 --> 00:51:30.033
systems dedicated to memory for
faces, memory for everyday

00:51:30.033 --> 00:51:33.170
objects, memory for spatial
locations.

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:39.789
The key to remembering is
organization and understanding.

00:51:39.789 --> 00:51:44.156
Introduction to "X" courses,
including Introduction to

00:51:44.156 --> 00:51:48.111
Psychology courses,
are among the hardest courses

00:51:48.111 --> 00:51:51.569
at Yale.
And the reason why is there is

00:51:51.569 --> 00:51:56.590
just a lot of material that is
diverse and you have to command

00:51:56.590 --> 00:52:00.228
each aspect separately.
The easiest courses at Yale

00:52:00.228 --> 00:52:03.725
tend to be highfalutin seminars
where you kind of have enough of

00:52:03.725 --> 00:52:06.389
a background that everything
is--can be clear and

00:52:06.389 --> 00:52:09.025
understandable.
The more you understand

00:52:09.025 --> 00:52:11.809
something, the easier you'll
remember it.

00:52:11.809 --> 00:52:15.331
And finally,
you can't trust some of your

00:52:15.331 --> 00:52:20.287
memories.
Your reading response for this

00:52:20.287 --> 00:52:27.596
week is you have to use your
powers for good and not for

00:52:27.596 --> 00:52:29.319
evil,
[laughter]

00:52:29.319 --> 00:52:32.813
though if you manage to succeed
at this I will be very

00:52:32.813 --> 00:52:34.308
impressed.
[laughter]

00:52:34.308 --> 00:52:37.822
But you have to describe,
based on the lecture materials

00:52:37.822 --> 00:52:41.080
and the readings,
how to implant a false memory.

00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:52.850
We have a few minutes.
Any questions on memory.

00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:55.604
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

00:52:55.604 --> 00:52:58.160
Professor Paul Bloom: Uh
huh.

00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:02.269
Hey.
Please-- Student:

00:53:02.269 --> 00:53:07.834
[inaudible]
Is that long-term sensory

00:53:07.834 --> 00:53:10.625
memory?
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:53:10.625 --> 00:53:12.672
The example is,
"What sort of memory is it when

00:53:12.672 --> 00:53:15.940
you know how to play the piano?"
And it's a very good question.

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:19.133
It is long-term memory because
you might know how to do a

00:53:19.133 --> 00:53:22.668
concerto or a song and then you
have it stored in your head and

00:53:22.668 --> 00:53:25.995
you carry it around with you.
You'll remember it a year from

00:53:25.995 --> 00:53:28.891
now, two years from now.
It is long-term memory but it

00:53:28.891 --> 00:53:32.564
is also an excellent example of
implicit memory because you know

00:53:32.564 --> 00:53:36.238
how to do it but you could do it
unconsciously without attending

00:53:36.238 --> 00:53:38.923
to it.
It's not sensory but it's as

00:53:38.923 --> 00:53:42.501
if, put it crudely,
that your fingers know and not

00:53:42.501 --> 00:53:45.564
your mind.
We have time for one more

00:53:45.564 --> 00:53:47.340
question.
Yes.

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:50.012
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:53:50.012 --> 00:53:52.150
The question is about
photographic memory.

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:55.780
There are a lot of claims about
photographic memory.

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:59.869
My understanding is they do not
tend to be substantiated.

00:53:59.869 --> 00:54:03.638
Sometimes photographic memory,
and this came up when we talked

00:54:03.638 --> 00:54:07.160
about autism a few classes ago,
is linked with savant-like

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:09.152
skills.
People who have severe

00:54:09.152 --> 00:54:12.553
impairments in some ways may
have photographic memories in

00:54:12.553 --> 00:54:14.570
others.
I am not convinced that

00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:17.966
photographic memory in the sense
that you see something,

00:54:17.966 --> 00:54:21.239
you take a picture of it,
you hold it in memory really

00:54:21.239 --> 00:54:23.948
exists.
I think there may be one or two

00:54:23.948 --> 00:54:27.630
case studies that suggest it
might be real but I think it's

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:29.349
controversial.
Okay.

00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:32.469
We have a guest lecturer on
Wednesday.

00:54:32.469 --> 00:59:43.000
Dean Peter Salovey will talk to
us about love.

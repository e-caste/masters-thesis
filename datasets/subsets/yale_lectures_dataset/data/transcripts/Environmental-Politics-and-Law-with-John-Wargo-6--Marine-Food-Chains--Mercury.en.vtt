00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.360
Prof: Today we're going
to turn our attention to the

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.690
problem of recognizing and
restoring hazardous sites.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.797
And you may think that this a
rather minor environmental issue

00:00:12.797 --> 00:00:16.904
compared to some of the others
that are more prominent in your

00:00:16.904 --> 00:00:17.780
thinking.
 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.201
But uncovering the diversity of
sites that have been

00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:27.662
contaminated and our history of
success and failure of restoring

00:00:27.662 --> 00:00:32.430
them reveals that within the
private sector alone,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.430
there are some 300,000 sites
that have been designated by the

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.630
Environmental Protection Agency
now as requiring restoration.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.958
Within the public sector,
if you look at only three

00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.548
organizations,
the Department of Energy,

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:50.056
that we looked at last week,
formerly the Atomic Energy

00:00:50.056 --> 00:00:51.949
Commission,
the Department of Defense and

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.122
the Department of the Interior,
those three departments alone

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:58.720
are responsible for 50,000 sites
that have been contaminated.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.539
Next week when we look at
agriculture,

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.225
we'll see that the repeated
application of biocides or

00:01:06.225 --> 00:01:09.983
pesticides to the same tract of
land for the purpose of

00:01:09.983 --> 00:01:13.739
protecting plants or killing
competitive species,

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:18.061
that these applications are
leaving residues in the soil

00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:21.989
that under many conditions would
classify them,

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:26.040
would justify classification to
also be hazardous sites.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.328
So the idea that simply because
they're agricultural lands that

00:01:29.328 --> 00:01:31.611
they're exempt from the
designation is quite

00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:32.459
interesting.
 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:35.709
Especially thinking about land
conversion,

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:39.099
how easy it is to convert
agricultural land to other kinds

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:42.668
of more intense land uses that
explains a lot of the way that

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:45.819
our rural areas have grown over
the past century.

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.840
So today, we're going to take a
look at lessons from the Defense

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.670
Department.
 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.170
And why the Defense Department?
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.345
Well, the Defense Department is
pretty interesting to me in that

00:01:56.345 --> 00:01:59.925
most people are paying most
attention to the problem of

00:01:59.925 --> 00:02:01.980
private site contamination.
 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.896
Most of the stories that you
may have heard of,

00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:10.408
private sites might include
Love Canal in New York.

00:02:10.408 --> 00:02:15.072
But every state has its set of
private sites that are on a

00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:16.300
cleanup list.
 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.688
And every state also has a
collection of public sites.

00:02:19.688 --> 00:02:24.971
So today we're going to look at
the way that environmental law

00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:29.560
has evolved to identify and to
manage these sites,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.961
with a particular eye to what
do we do with them in the

00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:33.530
future?
 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.098
What kinds of uses should we
allow?

00:02:36.098 --> 00:02:41.001
And that question often relies
upon a subordinate question,

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:44.720
which is how risky should the
site remain?

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.318
How clean should the site be
cleaned up?

00:02:46.318 --> 00:02:49.580
What standard of risk should be
applied?

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.878
One statute that we'll look at
will include the National

00:02:52.878 --> 00:02:55.038
Environmental Policy Act of
1969,

00:02:55.038 --> 00:03:00.725
really a vanguard statute that
was adopted really at the

00:03:00.725 --> 00:03:07.550
pinnacle of public concern about
loss of environmental quality,

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.807
riding the beginning of the
wave of the environmental

00:03:10.807 --> 00:03:13.258
movement,
or the second wave really of

00:03:13.258 --> 00:03:15.810
the environmental movement in
the nation.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.232
The Endangered Species Act is
also relevant often to hazardous

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:21.870
site management,
especially on federal lands.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.310
Why?
 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.470
Because federal facilities are
often in fairly remote areas.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.363
And those areas often include
large amounts of acreage that

00:03:31.363 --> 00:03:35.750
provide habitat for a real
diverse set of species.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.501
The Clean Water Act,
also known as the Federal Water

00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:41.020
Pollution Control Act,
is often at play in the

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.973
identification of these sites
and their cleanup because the

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:47.030
chemicals that were released run
off into surface waters.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.128
The Safe Drinking Water Act can
also apply,

00:03:50.128 --> 00:03:53.934
but we'll address that later in
the course as we deal with

00:03:53.934 --> 00:03:58.660
agricultural chemicals,
as water is either taken from

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.330
surface supplies and provided
for municipal or community

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.280
facilities to distribute out for
consumption.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.295
But also, the contamination of
underground aquifers is

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:16.521
extremely important,
and we'll touch on that this

00:04:16.521 --> 00:04:19.166
week, particularly looking at a
case on Cape Cod in

00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:21.420
Massachusetts,
the Massachusetts military

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.069
reservation.
 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:25.420
The Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act,

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.019
also known as RCRA,
R-C-R-A, is also at play,

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:32.913
that really is a statute
designed to monitor chemical

00:04:32.913 --> 00:04:36.733
release and movement if it
classified as a hazardous

00:04:36.733 --> 00:04:39.279
chemical from cradle to grave.
 

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.800
That phrase,
"cradle to grave,"

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.992
is important,
thinking that once you lose

00:04:42.992 --> 00:04:46.836
track anywhere in the cycle,
it's going to be extremely hard

00:04:46.836 --> 00:04:50.271
to figure out how you might
identify which sites are

00:04:50.271 --> 00:04:53.910
contaminated and how you might
need to clean it up.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.737
The statute today that we'll
concentrate most on will be the

00:04:56.737 --> 00:04:59.228
Comprehensive Environmental
Response Compensation and

00:04:59.228 --> 00:05:02.329
Liability Act,
also known as the Superfund law.

00:05:02.329 --> 00:05:06.726
And in this case also,
the case of Puerto Rico that

00:05:06.726 --> 00:05:10.651
we'll look at today,
the Wilderness Act is also at

00:05:10.651 --> 00:05:12.898
play,
as well as the underlying

00:05:12.898 --> 00:05:16.903
authorizing statute for the
creation of fish and wildlife

00:05:16.903 --> 00:05:17.689
refuges.
 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:19.278
Now why would that be?
 

00:05:19.278 --> 00:05:23.237
Well, it's a quirk in federal
environmental law that many

00:05:23.237 --> 00:05:26.841
former highly contaminated
facilities by the Defense

00:05:26.841 --> 00:05:30.250
Department especially,
have been transferred to the

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.769
jurisdiction of the Fish and
Wildlife Service.

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:36.124
They become the holders and the
managers of these facilities,

00:05:36.124 --> 00:05:39.199
in part because they tend to be
biologically diverse.

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.300
But also, for other reasons.
 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.708
So let's just pause for a
minute and take a look at

00:05:44.708 --> 00:05:46.464
CERCLA,
Comprehensive Environmental

00:05:46.464 --> 00:05:48.449
Response Compensation and
Liability Act,

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:52.509
passed in 1980 and then amended
in 1986.

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:55.899
It contains certain principles,
including the polluter pays

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:58.290
principle,
the idea that those parties

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.911
that were responsible should be
identified and they should be

00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:04.629
held accountable for the costs
of cleanup.

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:08.295
So this statute was designed to
clean up hazardous waste sites

00:06:08.295 --> 00:06:10.519
and to respond to hazardous
spills.

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:14.471
And it includes mechanisms to
clean up abandoned sites or

00:06:14.471 --> 00:06:16.870
sites owned by bankrupt parties.
 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.754
So in many cases,
you find these old factories

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:21.550
that have simply moved on.
 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.846
The corporations have dissolved
or they've become bankrupt,

00:06:24.846 --> 00:06:26.778
so who's going to clean them
up?

00:06:26.778 --> 00:06:29.839
Well, the Environmental
Protection Agency had a fund

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:33.560
that was created by CERCLA that
was generated by a tax on major

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.060
polluting industries.
 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.129
So the power industry,
the coal industry,

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:44.363
the oil industry chipped in to
create this trust fund that was

00:06:44.363 --> 00:06:48.459
then used to pay for clean up in
cases where the responsible

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:50.959
parties could not be identified.
 

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:53.692
So first of all,
the sites have to be

00:06:53.692 --> 00:06:54.680
identified.
 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.564
Second of all,
an investigation takes place in

00:06:57.564 --> 00:07:01.408
which the government is really
the detective trying to figure

00:07:01.408 --> 00:07:04.550
out who did what when and how
serious it was.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:10.105
So this statute also includes a
provision for what is known as

00:07:10.105 --> 00:07:14.242
joint and several liability,
which means that any one

00:07:14.242 --> 00:07:17.528
responsible party can be held
liable for the entire amount of

00:07:17.528 --> 00:07:18.350
the cleanup.
 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.591
So if you contributed only five
percent of the hazardous

00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:24.420
chemicals to a site,
then you could still be held

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.660
accountable for all cleanup
costs.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.894
But then again,
it would put the onus on the

00:07:29.894 --> 00:07:34.483
known responsible party to track
down who else contributed the

00:07:34.483 --> 00:07:36.740
other ninety-five percent.
 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.187
So it shifts the burden of the
detective work to the known

00:07:41.187 --> 00:07:42.750
responsible party.
 

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:48.255
The statute created something
known as a national priorities

00:07:48.255 --> 00:07:48.910
list.
 

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.718
So you can imagine if we're
facing 300,000 private sector

00:07:52.718 --> 00:07:55.110
sites,
50,000 known public sector

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.810
sites under the jurisdiction of
only three agencies,

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.875
how in the world are we going
to figure out which ones we need

00:08:01.875 --> 00:08:02.879
to concentrate on?
 

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:08.319
Well, this statute decided that
it was going to create a list.

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:10.607
And I think of this as a
listing statute,

00:08:10.607 --> 00:08:13.810
meaning that nothing gets
attention unless it gets put on

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:14.439
a list.
 

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:17.208
And by the way,
this is very similar to the

00:08:17.208 --> 00:08:21.031
Safe Drinking Water Act in that
a chemical will not get any

00:08:21.031 --> 00:08:23.379
attention,
it won't be monitored by

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:26.555
anybody unless it gets on the
Safe Drinking Water list of

00:08:26.555 --> 00:08:29.209
contaminates,
and there are only ninety-three

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:30.519
chemicals on that list.
 

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:34.927
And the Endangered Species Act
is also a listing statute in a

00:08:34.927 --> 00:08:37.940
sense, so the species has to be
listed.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.936
So in any case where you are
identifying a problem and you

00:08:41.936 --> 00:08:45.591
are putting it on a list,
you're going to have a lot of

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:48.976
political resistance to the
addition to the list because it

00:08:48.976 --> 00:08:52.769
means that someone is going to
have to change their behavior,

00:08:52.769 --> 00:08:56.508
either to pay for restoration
or in the case of endangered

00:08:56.508 --> 00:08:58.948
species,
to be sure that they use the

00:08:58.948 --> 00:09:02.879
landscape in a way that does not
harm the potential viability,

00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:07.058
reproductive success,
of the species in question.

00:09:07.058 --> 00:09:10.831
So these listing statutes,
Safe Drinking Water Act,

00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:13.547
Endangered Species Act,
in this case,

00:09:13.547 --> 00:09:17.320
the CERCLA NPL list,
National Priorities List.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.960
They operate via the same
mechanism.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.508
There's always a fight about
whether or not the problem gets

00:09:22.508 --> 00:09:23.048
listed.
 

00:09:23.048 --> 00:09:28.485
There's always a fight over
which other responsible parties

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:33.080
should be pulled into establish
accountability.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.160
And basically,
the lists themselves contain

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.408
far, far fewer problems than are
actually out there.

00:09:42.408 --> 00:09:46.041
Right now, there are about
3,000 potential national

00:09:46.041 --> 00:09:47.639
priority list sites.
 

00:09:47.639 --> 00:09:51.759
And EPA is looking at about 200
more that are likely to be

00:09:51.759 --> 00:09:52.408
listed.
 

00:09:52.408 --> 00:09:57.428
And there are 1,200,
roughly, on the list.

00:09:57.428 --> 00:10:00.964
And among those,
since the statute was enacted,

00:10:00.964 --> 00:10:03.269
only 773 have been restored.
 

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:07.070
And you need to think about the
word restored very carefully,

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:12.081
because it implies that the
site was tested after the effort

00:10:12.081 --> 00:10:16.667
was made to clean it up and
whatever residual chemicals

00:10:16.667 --> 00:10:20.658
remained posed an acceptable
level of risk.

00:10:20.658 --> 00:10:23.937
So the idea that the
contaminants could still be on

00:10:23.937 --> 00:10:27.807
the site, they could still be in
the water, but they pose an

00:10:27.807 --> 00:10:29.710
acceptable level of risk.
 

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:33.760
This is an important concept
and it's a highly debatable

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.476
concept that is often defined by
both subjective and quantitative

00:10:38.476 --> 00:10:39.360
metrics.
 

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.394
So seventy percent of listed
sites are being restored by the

00:10:43.394 --> 00:10:46.607
original polluters,
meaning that the responsible

00:10:46.607 --> 00:10:48.658
parties were identifiable.
 

00:10:48.658 --> 00:10:51.655
And the remaining thirty
percent account for roughly

00:10:51.655 --> 00:10:53.830
fifty percent of the federal
funds.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:57.745
Right now, because the trust
fund that was derived from the

00:10:57.745 --> 00:11:01.053
tax on industry had gone dry,
it went dry in 1995,

00:11:01.053 --> 00:11:03.889
and Congress never restored
that fund.

00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:08.741
So now the costs have been
shifted to the taxpayers in the

00:11:08.741 --> 00:11:10.019
General Fund.
 

00:11:10.019 --> 00:11:14.143
So EPA's cost recovery right
now ranges year to year between

00:11:14.143 --> 00:11:16.168
about 100 and $400 million.
 

00:11:16.168 --> 00:11:21.580
About 2,000 Defense Department
facilities are exceptionally

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.980
contaminated.
 

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.177
And among these,
there are certain types of

00:11:25.177 --> 00:11:27.767
facilities,
including the training

00:11:27.767 --> 00:11:32.495
facilities where different
branches of the military would

00:11:32.495 --> 00:11:37.730
convene to carry out exercises
in preparation for warfare,

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.600
particularly those that used
live ordinance.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.960
Ordinance means munitions or
ammunition.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:49.620
So that about 750 training
facilities exist in the nation.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.181
And they cover an area which is
quite strikingly large,

00:11:53.181 --> 00:11:54.830
about 15 million acres.
 

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:58.799
So Connecticut is about 6
million acres in size or maybe

00:11:58.799 --> 00:12:01.399
actually 3 million acres in
size,

00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:05.320
to give you a sense of the
scale of area that is under the

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.210
jurisdiction of the Defense
Department,

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.208
where there is very,
very little doubt about the

00:12:11.208 --> 00:12:13.570
extent of cleanup that's
necessary.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.798
On these sites,
it's expected to cost more than

00:12:15.798 --> 00:12:17.298
$20 billion to clean them up.
 

00:12:17.298 --> 00:12:20.778
And restoration is not expected
for about seventy years.

00:12:20.778 --> 00:12:24.059
Basically, it's being
constrained predominately by

00:12:24.059 --> 00:12:24.730
funding.
 

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.740
So for any of these sites,
in this case we'll be looking

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.860
at the Defense Department and
particularly the Navy as the

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.303
responsible party,
there are serious problems of

00:12:34.303 --> 00:12:38.823
historical reconstruction that
are compounded particularly by

00:12:38.823 --> 00:12:42.590
the authority of the Defense
Department to maintain

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:44.700
classified information.
 

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.856
So they don't have to tell us
what chemicals they used,

00:12:47.856 --> 00:12:49.668
what chemicals they released.
 

00:12:49.668 --> 00:12:52.639
They don't have to tell us the
details of the military

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:54.879
ordinance that were dropped or
buried.

00:12:54.879 --> 00:12:58.679
So that they can claim that it
would compromise national

00:12:58.679 --> 00:13:02.548
security objectives if this
information were released.

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:06.669
So it's often very difficult to
find it out.

00:13:06.669 --> 00:13:09.210
How certain is the evidence?
 

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:11.538
What's the standard of proof
that's necessary?

00:13:11.538 --> 00:13:15.269
Does the site itself justify
environmental restoration?

00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:19.278
Does it justify individual
compensation for people that

00:13:19.278 --> 00:13:21.580
live near it or worked on it?
 

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.216
Say, people that worked on
firing ranges or people that

00:13:25.216 --> 00:13:26.700
conducted exercises?
 

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:31.058
The GIs that would storm the
beaches under live fire?

00:13:31.058 --> 00:13:34.379
So are they eligible for
compensation?

00:13:34.379 --> 00:13:37.510
What's the value of property
that's lost or jobs that were

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.500
lost in an area?
 

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.072
So oftentimes,
when these facilities are

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:47.110
located, they create a boom in
the economy, in the local

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.210
economy.
 

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.341
For example,
when the Roosevelt Roads

00:13:50.341 --> 00:13:52.649
Facility was created in Puerto
Rico,

00:13:52.649 --> 00:13:57.065
by the year 2000 it was
generating about $300 million a

00:13:57.065 --> 00:14:01.480
year in revenue for the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:06.105
The Base Realignment and
Closure Statute that was passed

00:14:06.105 --> 00:14:09.543
by Congress in 1990,
designed to really take a

00:14:09.543 --> 00:14:13.272
careful look and see whether or
not it really made sense for us

00:14:13.272 --> 00:14:16.639
to continue having all of these
training facilities,

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:19.990
all the bases that are
sprinkled around the world,

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:23.120
began a process of closing
these bases down,

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.626
realigning military activities,
concentrating them at a time

00:14:27.626 --> 00:14:32.288
when the electronic nature of
warfare had evolved to the point

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:36.643
where weapons guidance and
weapons delivery often made the

00:14:36.643 --> 00:14:41.379
practicing of firing live
ammunition really unnecessary.

00:14:41.379 --> 00:14:44.921
The precision of the guidance
systems really diminished the

00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:48.096
need for certain kinds of
training and the release of

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:49.440
certain chemicals.
 

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.418
So the upshot was in this case
that the Roosevelt Roads Base

00:14:53.418 --> 00:14:57.193
was closed in Puerto Rico and
like that, $300 million was

00:14:57.193 --> 00:14:59.149
taken out of the economy.
 

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:04.633
So there was a property value
loss also associated with these

00:15:04.633 --> 00:15:09.933
facilities being recognized to
pose a nuisance in different

00:15:09.933 --> 00:15:13.533
forms,
not just in terms of chemical

00:15:13.533 --> 00:15:17.655
release to the environment,
but also in terms of

00:15:17.655 --> 00:15:22.083
contaminating groundwater or
adjacent agricultural lands or

00:15:22.083 --> 00:15:23.840
the effect of noise.
 

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.466
If any of you have ever lived
next to an Army base or an

00:15:27.466 --> 00:15:31.092
airport, you know that the
planes taking off and landing

00:15:31.092 --> 00:15:32.940
create quite a nuisance.
 

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.885
And in this case,
I got a call from a gentlemen

00:15:35.885 --> 00:15:39.792
in Puerto Rico who told me that
he was at a training site just

00:15:39.792 --> 00:15:41.330
yesterday afternoon.
 

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:46.769
He was at a training site and
he had worked there for the year

00:15:46.769 --> 00:15:49.889
between 1968 and 1969 on
Vieques.

00:15:49.889 --> 00:15:53.254
And for often twelve,
fifteen hours a day,

00:15:53.254 --> 00:15:56.950
planes would fly over the site
and bomb it.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.235
And as far as five,
six miles away,

00:15:59.235 --> 00:16:00.850
buildings would shake.
 

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.543
He said his Quonset hut,
where his job was to prepare

00:16:03.543 --> 00:16:06.240
food for Marines who were
training on the island,

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.679
the Quonset hut would shake,
the cans would shake,

00:16:08.679 --> 00:16:11.210
and it's quite disturbing.
 

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:14.580
So there was a psychological
effect there.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.649
So where should the burden of
proof of causation lie?

00:16:17.649 --> 00:16:19.763
Who should own the knowledge of
hazards that are found on the

00:16:19.763 --> 00:16:20.080
island?
 

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.058
Should this be public or
private information?

00:16:22.058 --> 00:16:24.743
Many of these questions are
similar to the questions that we

00:16:24.743 --> 00:16:26.788
asked relative to the nuclear
weapons case.

00:16:26.788 --> 00:16:30.561
What level of environmental
restoration should be required

00:16:30.561 --> 00:16:34.597
and how should national security
interests be balanced against

00:16:34.597 --> 00:16:38.567
environmental quality or human
health interests over the long

00:16:38.567 --> 00:16:39.230
run?
 

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:44.235
Now, also, you have to
recognize that the United States

00:16:44.235 --> 00:16:49.519
has been in the business of
training troops for its entire

00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:54.802
history so that imposition of
dozens of environmental laws

00:16:54.802 --> 00:17:00.294
between 1969 and the present,
on that pattern of behavior is

00:17:00.294 --> 00:17:02.379
quite interesting to follow.
 

00:17:02.379 --> 00:17:06.391
How do you think the Defense
Department would react to a new

00:17:06.391 --> 00:17:10.198
Clean Air Act that might
restrict their dropping of bombs

00:17:10.198 --> 00:17:12.848
that of course cause air
pollution?

00:17:12.848 --> 00:17:14.318
When you drop a bomb,
what happens?

00:17:14.318 --> 00:17:16.250
On the surface you get an
explosion.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:19.211
You get movement of the dust
and whatever is on the ground,

00:17:19.211 --> 00:17:22.068
the plants, the rocks,
the water, into the atmosphere.

00:17:22.068 --> 00:17:25.048
And just like the strontium-90
story, it goes someplace.

00:17:25.048 --> 00:17:29.311
So trying to figure out where
it goes and how to manage that

00:17:29.311 --> 00:17:32.779
in a way that protects these
additional values of

00:17:32.779 --> 00:17:36.680
environmental quality and human
health that the Defense

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.220
Department really never had to
worry about.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:44.069
So from their perspective,
the concerns of the environment

00:17:44.069 --> 00:17:47.989
and health are getting in the
way of their pursuit of their

00:17:47.989 --> 00:17:48.798
mission.
 

00:17:48.798 --> 00:17:51.773
So under situations like that,
you might wonder,

00:17:51.773 --> 00:17:53.420
well what would they do?
 

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.558
How would that affect their
behavior?

00:17:54.558 --> 00:17:58.154
What would it do to their
willingness to disclose what

00:17:58.154 --> 00:18:02.089
they've done in the past or to
take part in surveillance to

00:18:02.089 --> 00:18:06.500
figure out what happened to the
chemicals that were released?

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.502
Well, it's going to make them
not very happy about it and not

00:18:09.502 --> 00:18:12.507
want to spend a whole lot of
money on detecting problems that

00:18:12.507 --> 00:18:14.509
they are going to have to deal
with.

00:18:14.509 --> 00:18:17.781
Basically, the process of
environmental monitoring and

00:18:17.781 --> 00:18:21.608
health surveillance would create
serious problems for them,

00:18:21.608 --> 00:18:25.007
just as the Atomic Energy
Commission realized back in the

00:18:25.007 --> 00:18:27.845
1950s and 1960s,
the effect being that

00:18:27.845 --> 00:18:31.940
monitoring and surveillance
often are diminished,

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.894
making historical
reconstruction a really

00:18:34.894 --> 00:18:37.108
difficult process to follow.
 

00:18:37.108 --> 00:18:40.970
So that's all with just an
introduction to one case.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:45.106
And in my career,
I've worked on a variety of

00:18:45.106 --> 00:18:48.680
military sites sprinkled around
U.S.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.884
territories and thought about
the relative contamination among

00:18:53.884 --> 00:18:54.910
the sites.
 

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:59.208
And this site is particularly
interesting, because it lies off

00:18:59.208 --> 00:19:03.295
the east coast of Puerto Rico,
it's biologically enormously

00:19:03.295 --> 00:19:03.930
rich.
 

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:10.642
It has some of the most diverse
cluster of coral species in the

00:19:10.642 --> 00:19:11.075
U.S.
 

00:19:11.075 --> 00:19:12.700
territories.
 

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:18.813
It also has a variety of
different endangered species

00:19:18.813 --> 00:19:22.808
that are terrestrial and marine.
 

00:19:22.808 --> 00:19:26.103
So that thinking about the way
that these laws apply to this

00:19:26.103 --> 00:19:29.395
site may help you understand
some of the problems we face in

00:19:29.395 --> 00:19:30.288
restoration.
 

00:19:30.288 --> 00:19:34.095
I want to actually have you
think about what this island was

00:19:34.095 --> 00:19:37.191
like back in 1939,
when the military decided that

00:19:37.191 --> 00:19:39.318
they were going to create it.
 

00:19:39.318 --> 00:19:44.252
They were actually exploring
different bases in the Atlantic

00:19:44.252 --> 00:19:49.185
and they waited until Pearl
Harbor, when the Japanese bombed

00:19:49.185 --> 00:19:51.108
and routed the U.S.
 

00:19:51.108 --> 00:19:54.900
Navy and many ships,
many lives were lost in 1941.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:59.082
And they realized that
concentration of their troops

00:19:59.082 --> 00:20:02.537
and their facilities,
their ships in one area was

00:20:02.537 --> 00:20:05.431
extremely dangerous,
so that they decided they

00:20:05.431 --> 00:20:09.598
wanted to have an Atlantic Basin
counterpart to Pearl Harbor.

00:20:09.598 --> 00:20:12.940
They decided on the eastern
coast of Puerto Rico,

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:17.315
which you can see here is the
Roosevelt Roads at the head of

00:20:17.315 --> 00:20:20.565
the arrow,
which was the core of the base,

00:20:20.565 --> 00:20:22.630
Vieques and Culebra Island.
 

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:28.027
So the Roosevelt Roads Station
is a fairly large point that

00:20:28.027 --> 00:20:33.518
juts out into the Atlantic Ocean
and was highly suitable for

00:20:33.518 --> 00:20:37.798
birthing aircraft carriers and
destroyers.

00:20:37.798 --> 00:20:41.298
And Vieques became an island,
a repository,

00:20:41.298 --> 00:20:45.048
for a variety of different
weapons systems.

00:20:45.048 --> 00:20:49.070
And they built perhaps 200
different Wal-Mart size bunkers

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:53.163
into the side of the mountains
and the hillsides and stored

00:20:53.163 --> 00:20:56.480
just about every imaginable kind
of weapon.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.833
At last count,
the last the Defense Department

00:20:59.833 --> 00:21:03.729
released the information,
more than 200 different kinds

00:21:03.729 --> 00:21:07.284
of munitions ranging from land
mines to 500-pound bombs to

00:21:07.284 --> 00:21:11.089
2,000-pound bombs that are about
as long as this stage is wide

00:21:11.089 --> 00:21:13.960
and perhaps about that wide in
diameter,

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.578
were stored there as well as
nuclear weapons.

00:21:16.578 --> 00:21:21.009
It was one of the largest
nuclear weapons repositories in

00:21:21.009 --> 00:21:24.490
the nation during the period of
the Cold War,

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:28.048
leading up to the site's
closure in 2003.

00:21:28.048 --> 00:21:31.751
So the process of land
acquisition is also interesting,

00:21:31.751 --> 00:21:34.906
because it raises legal
questions that are also

00:21:34.906 --> 00:21:36.210
constitutional.
 

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:42.138
And you can imagine that this
island was owned predominately

00:21:42.138 --> 00:21:48.169
by several sugar plantations so
that 23,000 acres of land was

00:21:48.169 --> 00:21:52.190
purchased by the Defense
Department.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:57.410
And although the land itself
was owned by only four parties,

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:01.623
they had fee simple to the
land, it also was the home to

00:22:01.623 --> 00:22:05.836
several thousand workers who
basically lived an agrarian

00:22:05.836 --> 00:22:06.910
lifestyle.
 

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.558
They were allowed to live on
the land.

00:22:09.558 --> 00:22:12.527
They had no fee,
right, they had no legal title

00:22:12.527 --> 00:22:13.430
to the land.
 

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:16.827
Bu they had built their houses
and sometimes they had three,

00:22:16.827 --> 00:22:18.440
five, eight acres of land.
 

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.433
And they planted their own
vegetable gardens,

00:22:21.433 --> 00:22:25.109
they grazed their cows or their
pigs or their sheep.

00:22:25.109 --> 00:22:26.519
They had chickens.
 

00:22:26.519 --> 00:22:30.184
And they would take their
horses down to the coast and

00:22:30.184 --> 00:22:31.430
they would fish.
 

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:36.164
So they were extremely poor,
making often less than fifty,

00:22:36.164 --> 00:22:38.990
sixty dollars a year per
person.

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:42.223
And all of a sudden,
the military decided they were

00:22:42.223 --> 00:22:44.230
going to take over this base.
 

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:47.011
And these families were told
that they had to leave their

00:22:47.011 --> 00:22:47.358
land.
 

00:22:47.358 --> 00:22:50.770
They had to leave their houses,
often with only a twenty-four

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:54.410
or a forty-eight hour notice and
with very minor compensation for

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:56.059
loss of their facilities.
 

00:22:56.059 --> 00:22:58.640
Each family was given a tag.
 

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.380
They were given a tag with a
number on it.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.943
And they were put on the back
of a military truck and taken to

00:23:04.943 --> 00:23:08.451
the center part of the island
that is called in this shot the

00:23:08.451 --> 00:23:09.618
civilian sector.
 

00:23:09.618 --> 00:23:13.220
And they were told they should
go out into the field and find

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.519
their new property that had a
stake in the ground with a

00:23:16.519 --> 00:23:18.680
matching number on their ticket.
 

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:23.394
So one of the leaders of the
military resistance told me the

00:23:23.394 --> 00:23:28.351
story that is also in the book
Green Intelligence that I

00:23:28.351 --> 00:23:32.117
commend to you,
what it was like to be put out

00:23:32.117 --> 00:23:36.164
into a field and to sleep
through tropical downpours with

00:23:36.164 --> 00:23:37.900
literally no shelter.
 

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.140
So moving from an area that had
roads,

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.471
that had water supply,
that had sewage facilities to

00:23:44.471 --> 00:23:47.998
one that had none of those
institutional facilities was

00:23:47.998 --> 00:23:50.348
quite wrenching for the society.
 

00:23:50.348 --> 00:23:54.509
So I wondered what it was like
back in 1938,

00:23:54.509 --> 00:23:58.737
1940, before the Navy got
there, wondering if we could

00:23:58.737 --> 00:24:03.124
establish a baseline on this
site to figure out what had

00:24:03.124 --> 00:24:06.680
happened to it,
how the ecology might have

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:11.051
changed as a way of thinking
about what the landscape might

00:24:11.051 --> 00:24:12.410
be restored to.
 

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.400
And the area of restoration
ecology,

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.047
those of you that study this,
know that it's quite

00:24:19.047 --> 00:24:23.215
interesting and it's quite
perplexing in trying to figure

00:24:23.215 --> 00:24:27.460
out what exactly it is that is
your restoration goal.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:32.078
Do you want to restore the
species diversity,

00:24:32.078 --> 00:24:35.587
the soil quality,
the air quality as it was back

00:24:35.587 --> 00:24:38.114
in 1940,
or do you want to try to bring

00:24:38.114 --> 00:24:39.078
it back to 1900?
 

00:24:39.078 --> 00:24:42.868
So that what your target is,
is difficult.

00:24:42.868 --> 00:24:46.936
So I was fortunate enough to
obtain a complete set of air

00:24:46.936 --> 00:24:51.296
photos at a very high resolution
that you can't see from this

00:24:51.296 --> 00:24:51.950
shot.
 

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:55.665
But if you wanted to,
you could go onto a website

00:24:55.665 --> 00:24:59.150
that I put together with the map
librarian.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.362
Abe Parrish,
here, worked with me for a

00:25:02.362 --> 00:25:07.604
period of two years collecting
all of the imagery of the island

00:25:07.604 --> 00:25:11.240
over a period of between 1940
and 2008.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:17.875
So that now we have this really
rich ability to overlay all the

00:25:17.875 --> 00:25:21.460
air photographs,
all of the satellite imagery,

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.188
and all of the data files that
are called geographic

00:25:24.188 --> 00:25:27.395
information system overlays on
top of one another as a way of

00:25:27.395 --> 00:25:29.910
thinking about the ecology of
the island,

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:32.998
how water moves,
how biological diversity has

00:25:32.998 --> 00:25:35.557
changed,
and what at least the visible

00:25:35.557 --> 00:25:38.210
influence of the military might
have been.

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:41.875
We were also lucky enough that
the National Oceanic and

00:25:41.875 --> 00:25:45.883
Atmospheric Administration had
put together a GIS system for

00:25:45.883 --> 00:25:51.329
underwater,
for the underwater areas as

00:25:51.329 --> 00:25:52.298
well.
 

00:25:52.298 --> 00:25:55.428
And then we found that the
Defense Department had mapped

00:25:55.428 --> 00:25:57.759
with great precision the ocean
bottom,

00:25:57.759 --> 00:26:00.826
predominately so that they
could navigate among the coral

00:26:00.826 --> 00:26:04.823
reefs using vessels subsurface,
and also so that they could

00:26:04.823 --> 00:26:08.615
figure out trajectories for
firing torpedoes from

00:26:08.615 --> 00:26:10.778
submarines,
or rather, projectiles.

00:26:10.778 --> 00:26:15.278
So that the quality of the data
for this island is just,

00:26:15.278 --> 00:26:18.711
it's spectacular for anybody
that is interested in doing

00:26:18.711 --> 00:26:22.577
additional research that might
want to historically reconstruct

00:26:22.577 --> 00:26:26.009
what was there or what happened
to the environment.

00:26:26.009 --> 00:26:29.458
In this site and on the eastern
part of the island that became

00:26:29.458 --> 00:26:31.720
the focus of the training
activities--

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.970
could I get the lights dimmed a
little bit in the back?

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:37.460
Actually, just on the podium
here.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:41.664
If you look very carefully,
you can see here is the

00:26:41.664 --> 00:26:45.121
Caribbean coastline,
the north side of the island,

00:26:45.121 --> 00:26:47.009
which is only a mile of
landscape,

00:26:47.009 --> 00:26:51.240
is the Atlantic Ocean.
 

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.775
But it's very low in elevation,
so you can see a lagoon

00:26:54.775 --> 00:26:58.767
stretching in this direction,
another lagoon over here,

00:26:58.767 --> 00:27:02.349
and a third over here,
and a fourth over there.

00:27:02.349 --> 00:27:03.990
So it's a very low-lying area.
 

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:08.058
So what's really quite striking
is thinking about how,

00:27:08.058 --> 00:27:10.838
when they were choosing this
site as a bombing range,

00:27:10.838 --> 00:27:14.355
they were not thinking at all
about chemical movement or

00:27:14.355 --> 00:27:15.380
chemical fate.
 

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.130
So what would happen if you
dropped bombs on this area?

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:21.390
What would happen if you lobbed
artillery shells onto it?

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:23.230
Where would they go?
 

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:26.380
So these questions were not
even close to their thinking.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.819
The island also,
this is a shot looking back at

00:27:29.819 --> 00:27:33.932
the Western end of the island,
where the weapons storage

00:27:33.932 --> 00:27:35.130
bunkers are.
 

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:38.737
And they originally had thought
that they would join the island

00:27:38.737 --> 00:27:41.880
to the mainland of Puerto Rico
using this long pier.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.660
Here's another shot of the
beaches along the island.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:50.230
Really spectacular beaches on
the south side that are clean.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:53.568
They're not chemically damaged.
 

00:27:53.568 --> 00:27:57.325
But occasionally,
as you dive in these coves or

00:27:57.325 --> 00:28:01.015
in the bays,
you'll see wreckage of a plane

00:28:01.015 --> 00:28:05.369
that was downed or old
unexploded bombs that are lying

00:28:05.369 --> 00:28:07.259
beneath the surface.
 

00:28:07.259 --> 00:28:11.828
So here's just an example of
the kind of comparative analysis

00:28:11.828 --> 00:28:16.923
that you could do over time,
kind of wondering how the

00:28:16.923 --> 00:28:23.597
landscape changed from 1939 over
here to 1970 to 1985 and into

00:28:23.597 --> 00:28:27.556
the 1990s,
where you can see up in the top

00:28:27.556 --> 00:28:28.730
here a runway.
 

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:34.625
You can see different areas
where the vegetation has been

00:28:34.625 --> 00:28:38.308
restricted and either bombed
out.

00:28:38.308 --> 00:28:42.490
And this shot is a little bit
higher in resolution.

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:46.670
And you could see that there is
a little star here,

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.185
which is a surface-to-air
missile site that became a

00:28:49.185 --> 00:28:51.617
target,
and ships would launch their

00:28:51.617 --> 00:28:53.279
missiles from offshore.
 

00:28:53.279 --> 00:28:56.856
Actually, historically,
the closer to the present you

00:28:56.856 --> 00:29:00.710
find the ships would park
further and further offshore as

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:04.150
the electronic guidance systems
became better.

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:06.756
And more and more,
the weapons would actually

00:29:06.756 --> 00:29:08.000
reach the mainland.
 

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.878
The military argued quite
vehemently that the nation

00:29:12.878 --> 00:29:17.950
should accept the ordinance that
missed the island.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:19.140
It was a training ground.
 

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.880
People make errors,
and that's the idea,

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.971
is to help the pilots and help
the Navy and the Marines become

00:29:24.971 --> 00:29:28.460
more precise in their effort to
reach the targets.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.808
They set tanks up on hillsides.
 

00:29:30.808 --> 00:29:35.234
They also set tanks and
aircraft along runways to become

00:29:35.234 --> 00:29:36.038
targets.
 

00:29:36.038 --> 00:29:42.565
So this was not a minor
intensity of target practice and

00:29:42.565 --> 00:29:43.868
training.
 

00:29:43.868 --> 00:29:46.900
I'm going to jump ahead here
for a minute.

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:51.146
One example back from 1950
taken out of the New York Times

00:29:51.146 --> 00:29:55.617
demonstrates that there were
80,000 servicemen that converged

00:29:55.617 --> 00:29:57.630
on the island in March.
 

00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:01.630
It was a group that consisted
of the Army,

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:04.738
the Air Force,
the Navy, the Marines from the

00:30:04.738 --> 00:30:07.125
United States,
but also from Great Britain,

00:30:07.125 --> 00:30:08.269
from other allied nations.
 

00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:13.040
So that allies would get
together and try to coordinate

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.426
land assaults,
air assaults,

00:30:15.426 --> 00:30:19.578
and subsurface assaults using
live weapons.

00:30:19.578 --> 00:30:24.670
They stopped using the adjacent
island,

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:29.038
Culebra, and they concentrated
additional efforts on Vieques,

00:30:29.038 --> 00:30:31.410
which further contaminated the
island,

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:33.009
beginning in 1971.
 

00:30:33.009 --> 00:30:36.932
One other point I wanted to
make about this is that if the

00:30:36.932 --> 00:30:41.131
public is trying to figure out
and rebuild an image of what it

00:30:41.131 --> 00:30:45.328
was like and also to understand
what the government did,

00:30:45.328 --> 00:30:49.250
it's extremely difficult,
because the military,

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:51.950
the Defense Department,
will restrict access.

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:55.894
Their first response to a
request for access would be,

00:30:55.894 --> 00:30:59.690
"Well, you know,
it really is too dangerous.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:04.555
You can't go on this site
because there are unexploded

00:31:04.555 --> 00:31:10.064
weapons and we are the only ones
that are trained to identify

00:31:10.064 --> 00:31:15.940
those and basically to figure
out what the chemical risk is.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.950
So you basically need to trust
us."

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:20.200
They would work with their own
consulting firms.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.923
In fact, the same consulting
firms tend to work at the same

00:31:23.923 --> 00:31:26.170
kinds of sites around the
nation.

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:30.433
And they would basically
provide reports to people that

00:31:30.433 --> 00:31:32.328
would be unverifiable.
 

00:31:32.328 --> 00:31:35.455
So the level of accountability
on a site like this is quite

00:31:35.455 --> 00:31:35.779
low.
 

00:31:35.779 --> 00:31:40.201
The fence that you see here is
really symbolic of a limit of

00:31:40.201 --> 00:31:41.400
public access.
 

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:47.348
How much weaponry was dropped
on the island?

00:31:47.348 --> 00:31:49.048
Well, this was a basic
question, and we still don't

00:31:49.048 --> 00:31:50.000
have a really good answer.
 

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.380
We do know that about 200
different types of weapons were

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.009
released onto the island.
 

00:31:55.009 --> 00:31:58.786
And during the period between
1983 and 1998 the Defense

00:31:58.786 --> 00:32:02.981
Department admitted that about
80 million pounds of ordinance

00:32:02.981 --> 00:32:05.220
had been dropped on Vieques.
 

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:09.528
So that if you extrapolate
roughly over time and correlate

00:32:09.528 --> 00:32:13.762
it with their disclosure of
number of troops and types of

00:32:13.762 --> 00:32:18.439
exercises that were conducted,
conservatively you could

00:32:18.439 --> 00:32:23.429
estimate that 150 million pounds
of bombs and munitions were

00:32:23.429 --> 00:32:24.358
dropped.
 

00:32:24.358 --> 00:32:29.220
Destroyers would sit offshore
and they would lob these

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.430
artillery shells onto the
island.

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:35.584
Here is the USS Saratoga
sitting off of Vieques

00:32:35.584 --> 00:32:39.560
practicing, softening up the
island is the phrase that they

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.108
use.
 

00:32:40.108 --> 00:32:43.643
And this would be followed
shortly thereafter by troops

00:32:43.643 --> 00:32:47.568
that would launch amphibious
vehicles from the holds of large

00:32:47.568 --> 00:32:51.559
transport ships that would crawl
up onto the beach and release

00:32:51.559 --> 00:32:55.747
the troops that would then storm
across the island firing machine

00:32:55.747 --> 00:32:59.556
guns at each other,
at troops that invaded the

00:32:59.556 --> 00:33:01.759
island on its opposite side.
 

00:33:01.759 --> 00:33:04.599
So what's in these weapons?
 

00:33:04.599 --> 00:33:05.960
What was released?
 

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.848
What we do know is that napalm
was released.

00:33:08.848 --> 00:33:12.480
And if you have not heard of
napalm, it's a horrific weapon.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:17.332
It's basically gasoline in gel
form so that when it's dropped,

00:33:17.332 --> 00:33:21.390
it will ignite and burn
anything that is near it.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:23.608
Agent Orange is another
chemical.

00:33:23.608 --> 00:33:26.962
It's a combination of two
herbicides that became infamous

00:33:26.962 --> 00:33:28.460
during the Vietnam War.
 

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:33.038
Transport planes would fly over
Vietnam and they would drop

00:33:33.038 --> 00:33:35.249
Agent Orange,
which is 2,4-D,

00:33:35.249 --> 00:33:37.460
an herbicide,
and 2,5-T.

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:41.784
And the combination would
defoliate thousands of square

00:33:41.784 --> 00:33:46.509
miles of tropical forest in both
North and South Vietnam.

00:33:46.509 --> 00:33:49.109
Agent Orange was also used on
this island.

00:33:49.109 --> 00:33:51.250
Also chaff.
 

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:54.048
And chaff is interesting in
that chaff is designed to jam

00:33:54.048 --> 00:33:54.450
radar.
 

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:59.568
So chaff is a very small
thread, it's a filament of maybe

00:33:59.568 --> 00:34:02.769
several millimeters in
thickness.

00:34:02.769 --> 00:34:06.920
And it formerly was wound with
a lead wire.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.760
And the lead would basically
reflect radar.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.880
So that there were many
instances where the San Juan,

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:18.083
Puerto Rico weather stations
would be reporting thunderstorms

00:34:18.083 --> 00:34:22.331
over Vieques when in fact,
it was simply a misread of

00:34:22.331 --> 00:34:26.398
their radar that was bouncing
off of the lead chaff that would

00:34:26.398 --> 00:34:30.329
be dropped from these bundles
out of the cargo bays over the

00:34:30.329 --> 00:34:31.130
island.
 

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:34.981
So lead chaff would eventually
just kind of rain down onto the

00:34:34.981 --> 00:34:35.739
landscape.
 

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:41.054
So tens of thousands of tons of
lead chaff would be dropped

00:34:41.054 --> 00:34:46.369
during aerial Air Force training
exercises in an attempt to

00:34:46.369 --> 00:34:48.659
disarm and disorient.
 

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:52.570
So as one example of the
intensity of the attacks,

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:55.498
during 1978,
about 1,500 hours of

00:34:55.498 --> 00:35:00.818
air-to-ground bombing occurred,
100,000 missiles were fired

00:35:00.818 --> 00:35:04.211
onto the island,
1,000 hours of ship-to-shore

00:35:04.211 --> 00:35:04.829
bombing.
 

00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:07.800
So in one single year,
5 million pounds of ordinance.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:12.744
Give you one quick view of an
amphibious craft going up over

00:35:12.744 --> 00:35:13.750
the beach.
 

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:15.050
This is a small craft.
 

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:17.706
The larger craft could
transport fifty to a hundred

00:35:17.706 --> 00:35:18.929
troops in their hold.
 

00:35:18.929 --> 00:35:21.972
And they'd go up over the
beaches, raising really

00:35:21.972 --> 00:35:25.775
interesting questions about the
application of the Endangered

00:35:25.775 --> 00:35:26.789
Species Act.
 

00:35:26.789 --> 00:35:30.896
Now, the military argued that
the marine amphibious training

00:35:30.896 --> 00:35:34.795
is much more important than
worrying about the endangered

00:35:34.795 --> 00:35:37.675
species,
that included the manatees and

00:35:37.675 --> 00:35:39.335
pelicans,
the hawksbill,

00:35:39.335 --> 00:35:41.880
the green, and the loggerhead
turtle.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.875
And the turtles were very
interesting in this history in

00:35:45.875 --> 00:35:50.088
that it's long been a site for
turtles to crawl up onto the

00:35:50.088 --> 00:35:54.228
beach and dig holes into the
sand right at the base of the

00:35:54.228 --> 00:35:55.099
dunes.
 

00:35:55.099 --> 00:35:58.010
And the holes that they would
dig would be between eighteen

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:00.320
inches and maybe thirty-six
inches in depth.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.018
And they'd lay their eggs in
those holes and then they'd

00:36:03.018 --> 00:36:04.489
crawl off back to the ocean.
 

00:36:04.489 --> 00:36:08.304
It's pretty remarkable the way
that they come back to the same

00:36:08.304 --> 00:36:09.929
island, year after year.
 

00:36:09.929 --> 00:36:17.639
And between six and about
twenty-four weeks later,

00:36:17.639 --> 00:36:20.686
the eggs hatch,
the little turtles crawl up to

00:36:20.686 --> 00:36:24.750
the surface and they wander down
to the water's edge and swim

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:25.360
away.
 

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.750
Really quite remarkable.
 

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:28.952
These three species of turtle,
the hawksbill,

00:36:28.952 --> 00:36:32.007
the green, and the loggerhead,
are protected by the Endangered

00:36:32.007 --> 00:36:32.809
Species Act.
 

00:36:32.809 --> 00:36:39.039
At the same time the military
was landing their craft on the

00:36:39.039 --> 00:36:41.132
beach,
troops would get out,

00:36:41.132 --> 00:36:43.309
people would be assigned to dig
holes,

00:36:43.309 --> 00:36:47.210
bury landmines or bury
munitions in the beach.

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:50.418
And in one case,
a former Marine told me that

00:36:50.418 --> 00:36:52.353
yes,
they had buried munitions in

00:36:52.353 --> 00:36:55.608
the beach and they really didn't
have time to pick them up on the

00:36:55.608 --> 00:36:58.659
way out because they were late
for their next assignment.

00:36:58.659 --> 00:37:02.929
So they left the munitions
buried beneath the beach.

00:37:02.929 --> 00:37:06.369
Some of these were detected in
2004,

00:37:06.369 --> 00:37:09.893
when the Fish and Wildlife
Service took over the area and

00:37:09.893 --> 00:37:13.795
demanded that the most sensitive
screening of the beaches occur

00:37:13.795 --> 00:37:16.880
before they would be opened up
to the public.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:21.045
One other interesting
association between the case of

00:37:21.045 --> 00:37:26.826
nuclear testing and this case,
that was purely coincidental,

00:37:26.826 --> 00:37:30.719
was this history of the USS
Killen.

00:37:30.719 --> 00:37:33.766
Commissioned in 1944,
it saw action in the Pacific in

00:37:33.766 --> 00:37:35.641
World War II,
particularly in the

00:37:35.641 --> 00:37:36.579
Philippines.
 

00:37:36.579 --> 00:37:42.940
And it was eventually part of
the Operation Hardtack,

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:46.048
including an Operation Wahoo
and Umbrella in the Marshall

00:37:46.048 --> 00:37:49.032
Islands,
in the Enewetak Atoll in 1958,

00:37:49.032 --> 00:37:53.780
where it was one of those ships
that were pulled together and

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.550
being tested for its resilience.
 

00:37:56.550 --> 00:38:00.139
Well, as I mentioned with the
case of ships being sprayed by

00:38:00.139 --> 00:38:03.789
water and that didn't take the
radiation out of the ship,

00:38:03.789 --> 00:38:07.460
then being dragged back to
Hunter's Point in San Francisco

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:08.750
for sand blasting.
 

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:11.130
They didn't really know what to
do with all the ships.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:13.766
And this one happened to be
dragged by barge all the way

00:38:13.766 --> 00:38:15.780
across the Pacific to the Panama
Canal,

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:19.380
through the Panama Canal up
into the Caribbean Basin and

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:23.570
then anchored off of the shore
of Vieques for target practice.

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:27.380
So sitting about three-quarters
of a mile off of the shoreline.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.150
So right now,
you can see the military base

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:33.911
in the background and that same
missile site I referred to

00:38:33.911 --> 00:38:37.101
earlier,
and the USS Killen is buried

00:38:37.101 --> 00:38:38.099
right here.
 

00:38:38.099 --> 00:38:39.969
It really is quite striking.
 

00:38:39.969 --> 00:38:41.820
I've taken some students down
to this site.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.179
And diving beneath it,
you see the hull of the ship.

00:38:45.179 --> 00:38:48.619
You see bombs scattered around
it.

00:38:48.619 --> 00:38:50.809
You see many old barrels too.
 

00:38:50.809 --> 00:38:55.394
And the military has not
released what the content of the

00:38:55.394 --> 00:38:56.460
barrels is.
 

00:38:56.460 --> 00:39:01.166
But it's a bit worrisome
knowing that the sand that is

00:39:01.166 --> 00:39:05.429
now in it came from the Marshall
Islands area.

00:39:05.429 --> 00:39:09.961
But also, it's quite striking
that the biological diversity in

00:39:09.961 --> 00:39:11.820
the region is enormous.
 

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:16.336
So there was one gun turret
that my students and I looked

00:39:16.336 --> 00:39:21.420
into where a barracuda popped
his head out of the gun turret.

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:26.978
Tiger sharks that are sleeping
on the bottom of the broken up

00:39:26.978 --> 00:39:31.148
hull, parrotfish,
angelfish, just really alive

00:39:31.148 --> 00:39:34.300
with different marine species.
 

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.170
It was quite interesting to
hear the arguments on the part

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:40.242
of the military and other people
that are trying to figure out

00:39:40.242 --> 00:39:42.610
what to do with especially
metallic wastes.

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:48.925
And many who have that problem
are quite anxious just to go out

00:39:48.925 --> 00:39:52.489
and use the oceans as their
dump.

00:39:52.489 --> 00:39:56.521
And they can demonstrate pretty
well that if they build a reef

00:39:56.521 --> 00:40:01.123
out of an old ship or old cars,
that it will serve as a pretty

00:40:01.123 --> 00:40:05.360
effective habitat for a wide
range of marine species.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:08.340
Now this is an interesting
example.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.976
Looking off the coast,
several people wondered,

00:40:11.976 --> 00:40:16.324
including a colleague of mine,
Jim Porter, who is at the

00:40:16.324 --> 00:40:18.380
University of Georgia.
 

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.980
Jim is an ecologist who was
trained here at Yale.

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:23.467
And he's been working on
Vieques as well for a number of

00:40:23.467 --> 00:40:23.829
years.
 

00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:28.338
And the Navy tried to explain
these circles beneath the

00:40:28.338 --> 00:40:32.929
surface of the water as being
created by hurricanes,

00:40:32.929 --> 00:40:36.695
rather than being created by
bombs that had been dropped

00:40:36.695 --> 00:40:39.710
creating these craters in the
ocean floor.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:44.282
So their argument was holes in
the Viequen coral reef are

00:40:44.282 --> 00:40:46.159
caused by hurricanes.
 

00:40:46.159 --> 00:40:49.253
Well, you know,
it's really quite apparent that

00:40:49.253 --> 00:40:50.800
this is not the case.
 

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.768
You see similarly sized holes
that are in the landscape.

00:40:54.768 --> 00:40:59.623
But also Jim went out and
constructed a robot that would

00:40:59.623 --> 00:41:04.389
wander through these areas that
had live ordinance,

00:41:04.389 --> 00:41:07.340
lying either within them or
next to them.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:12.403
And he would take samples from
inside the craters and then from

00:41:12.403 --> 00:41:15.590
various distances outside the
crater.

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:16.829
I think I have a shot of this.
 

00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:21.710
Yes, and he actually mapped out
the distribution of some heavy

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:26.590
metals that clearly demonstrated
that these were not caused by

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:27.789
hurricanes.
 

00:41:27.789 --> 00:41:31.585
The Navy also claimed that
higher levels of lead in the

00:41:31.585 --> 00:41:35.731
soil or other metals were the
cause of dust storms that blew

00:41:35.731 --> 00:41:39.597
over from Africa so that the
island does experience dust

00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:42.829
storms during certain parts of
the year.

00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:45.059
In fact, aircraft navigation is
interrupted.

00:41:45.059 --> 00:41:49.422
But they attempted to confuse
their contribution,

00:41:49.422 --> 00:41:54.876
with natural contribution to
the level of chemical residue on

00:41:54.876 --> 00:41:56.239
the island.
 

00:41:56.239 --> 00:42:01.347
Here's one shot looking at the
old barrels inside the rusting

00:42:01.347 --> 00:42:05.179
hulk of the Killen,
and with extremely healthy

00:42:05.179 --> 00:42:08.329
coral reefs growing right
nearby.

00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:12.666
An example of napalm being
dropped on the island and what

00:42:12.666 --> 00:42:14.059
that looks like.
 

00:42:14.059 --> 00:42:17.362
Also, the United States leased
out bombing rights,

00:42:17.362 --> 00:42:21.273
and think about the idea of
potentially responsible parties

00:42:21.273 --> 00:42:21.880
here.
 

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:25.643
If the United States leased out
bombing rights to NATO countries

00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:29.021
and other allies,
does that infer that they are

00:42:29.021 --> 00:42:32.409
similarly responsible for
restoration costs?

00:42:32.409 --> 00:42:35.050
So Canada, Germany,
France, Britain,

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:37.914
Chile, and Argentina all
participated on several

00:42:37.914 --> 00:42:41.146
occasions in coming to the
island and joining with the

00:42:41.146 --> 00:42:42.550
training exercises.
 

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:47.643
There was a website that the
military had up for a good part

00:42:47.643 --> 00:42:49.369
of the late 1990s.
 

00:42:49.369 --> 00:42:53.978
And they proclaimed that this
was a great site for one-stop

00:42:53.978 --> 00:42:56.679
shopping so that companies,
U.S.

00:42:56.679 --> 00:42:59.577
companies, multinational
companies, including Raytheon,

00:42:59.577 --> 00:43:01.349
General Electric,
Lockheed Martin,

00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:04.570
would supply and sell diverse
weapon systems on Vieques.

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:10.273
And it was advertised quite
heavily and it had many

00:43:10.273 --> 00:43:11.869
attractions.
 

00:43:11.869 --> 00:43:14.181
These are quotes,
that it was a "suitable

00:43:14.181 --> 00:43:17.007
area for over the beach and
aerial troop movement,"

00:43:17.007 --> 00:43:19.577
"live fire capability for
most nonconventional

00:43:19.577 --> 00:43:21.786
weapons,"
"simultaneous conduct of

00:43:21.786 --> 00:43:23.739
gunnery missile firing.."
 

00:43:23.739 --> 00:43:27.159
I don't even know what ATG
ordinance delivery is.

00:43:27.159 --> 00:43:29.465
"Amphibious small arms
mining and underwater

00:43:29.465 --> 00:43:30.380
operations."
 

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.659
"Missile firing
operations: air-to-air,

00:43:32.659 --> 00:43:34.250
air-to-surface,
surface-to-air,

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:36.000
and surface-to-surface."
 

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.268
So that by the middle of the
1990s,

00:43:38.268 --> 00:43:42.413
the United States was securing
about $85 million per year in

00:43:42.413 --> 00:43:46.416
payments from other nations to
gain the right to try these

00:43:46.416 --> 00:43:47.260
weapons.
 

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:50.701
So the representatives from
Raytheon and these other

00:43:50.701 --> 00:43:54.682
corporations would meet the Navy
or the Air Force from other

00:43:54.682 --> 00:43:58.664
nations and ask them if they
would like to try out different

00:43:58.664 --> 00:44:00.690
kinds of weapon systems.
 

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:05.289
And this further increased the
intensity of exercises.

00:44:05.289 --> 00:44:09.262
Here's a shot of the weapons
storage bunkers that I

00:44:09.262 --> 00:44:14.190
mentioned, that were designed to
basically maintain storage.

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:16.590
These were really interestingly
designed.

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:19.150
They were built into the
hillside, and then they were

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:21.119
planted over the top with green
roofs.

00:44:21.119 --> 00:44:24.010
You wouldn't think that the
Defense Department might have

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:26.179
been the first designer of a
green roof.

00:44:26.179 --> 00:44:31.429
But in this case,
back in the 1940s and 1950s,

00:44:31.429 --> 00:44:35.797
they were building green roofs
basically to provide cover so

00:44:35.797 --> 00:44:40.385
that satellites from the Soviet
Union or other nations would be

00:44:40.385 --> 00:44:45.050
fooled into thinking that these
were just small grazing plots so

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:49.195
that they would lease these
lands out to local farmers to

00:44:49.195 --> 00:44:53.635
graze cattle or goats on the top
of these concrete structures

00:44:53.635 --> 00:44:56.820
that housed weapons of all
sorts.

00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:01.489
The intensity of fire produced
an extraordinary mess.

00:45:01.489 --> 00:45:04.913
And if you look at the surface
now of some of these craters,

00:45:04.913 --> 00:45:07.639
you see that they tend to fill
up with water.

00:45:07.639 --> 00:45:10.858
And you need to imagine what
happens when a bomb explodes on

00:45:10.858 --> 00:45:12.768
the land and it creates a
crater.

00:45:12.768 --> 00:45:16.914
It will break itself up into
literally billions of

00:45:16.914 --> 00:45:18.690
microscopic pieces.
 

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:20.480
Pieces of what?
 

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:23.403
Pieces of lead,
mercury, cadmium,

00:45:23.403 --> 00:45:28.340
aluminum, different kinds of
explosives, including RDX,

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:32.268
HDX, TNT would be more familiar
to you.

00:45:32.268 --> 00:45:36.115
But it basically impregnates
these chemicals into the side of

00:45:36.115 --> 00:45:36.949
the crater.
 

00:45:36.949 --> 00:45:41.244
Tropical storms come along and
they will dump six,

00:45:41.244 --> 00:45:43.699
eight, ten inches of rain.
 

00:45:43.699 --> 00:45:46.237
On one occasion,
I was there after Storm Jean

00:45:46.237 --> 00:45:47.679
hit the island in 2004.
 

00:45:47.679 --> 00:45:50.518
And in a matter of about
forty-eight hours,

00:45:50.518 --> 00:45:53.760
nearly two feet of rain had
dropped on the island,

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:57.172
creating those low-lying areas,
those lagoons that I had

00:45:57.172 --> 00:45:59.469
pointed out earlier in the
lecture.

00:45:59.469 --> 00:46:03.590
Basically creating a massive
lake in the region.

00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:06.889
So here's an example of the
edge of one of these craters.

00:46:06.889 --> 00:46:11.304
And you can see the vegetation
growing quite well,

00:46:11.304 --> 00:46:16.530
once you get up out of the--
above the water table area.

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:19.565
And that is in part a function
of the fact that bombs often

00:46:19.565 --> 00:46:22.550
contain a fairly high level of
nitrogen and phosphorus.

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:27.311
So in 2003, when the Base
Relocation Commission Closed the

00:46:27.311 --> 00:46:31.570
site down and they stopped
exploding the vegetation,

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:35.079
it really has come back in full
bloom.

00:46:35.079 --> 00:46:38.179
And many different species are
now quite abundant.

00:46:38.179 --> 00:46:41.423
And they're growing in these
thickets, basically making it

00:46:41.423 --> 00:46:44.726
almost impossible to see what
the ordinance would be on the

00:46:44.726 --> 00:46:45.409
surface.
 

00:46:45.409 --> 00:46:47.449
So it's more dangerous than it
ever was before.

00:46:47.449 --> 00:46:51.925
I was standing with a
representative from the House

00:46:51.925 --> 00:46:54.699
overlooking the site one day.
 

00:46:54.699 --> 00:46:57.690
And he was exclaiming how it
was coming back,

00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:00.764
how the site was restoring
itself because it appeared to be

00:47:00.764 --> 00:47:03.838
so green and lush because of
this effect of the fertilizers

00:47:03.838 --> 00:47:05.268
that were in the bombs.
 

00:47:05.268 --> 00:47:08.322
And I turned to him and I shook
my head and said,

00:47:08.322 --> 00:47:10.929
"No, you completely
misunderstand.

00:47:10.929 --> 00:47:12.389
It's not restoring itself.
 

00:47:12.389 --> 00:47:16.612
The bombs are still beneath the
surface, beneath the vegetation,

00:47:16.612 --> 00:47:19.159
and it needs to be cleaned
up."

00:47:19.159 --> 00:47:23.056
If you dive beneath the
surface, you can see weapons

00:47:23.056 --> 00:47:27.869
such as this 2,000-pound bomb
being measured by Dr. Porter.

00:47:27.869 --> 00:47:32.447
And he's also measured the
leakage of the chemicals and the

00:47:32.447 --> 00:47:37.260
explosives from the bomb into
the environment and demonstrated

00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:40.844
that the coral--
the coral are very important

00:47:40.844 --> 00:47:45.427
and excellent historical records
of the chemical diversity of the

00:47:45.427 --> 00:47:48.219
area and how it's shifted over
time.

00:47:48.219 --> 00:47:51.958
So as the coral grows,
you could test different depths

00:47:51.958 --> 00:47:55.081
from the surface,
and you can come up with a

00:47:55.081 --> 00:47:58.570
chemical matrix that will give
you some idea of what's

00:47:58.570 --> 00:47:59.360
happened.
 

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:03.554
Give you a sense as well of
what the site looks like after

00:48:03.554 --> 00:48:05.320
the bombs are dropped.
 

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.940
The vegetation is literally
obliterated.

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:14.489
And today it looks quite
different than this.

00:48:14.489 --> 00:48:17.315
So I'll pause there and we'll
come back and take a look at

00:48:17.315 --> 00:48:20.389
several statutes on Thursday
that are particularly relevant.

00:48:20.389 --> 00:48:22.159
Thank you.
 

00:48:22.159 --> 00:48:28.000

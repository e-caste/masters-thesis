00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.348
Prof: Then let's go on
to Jean Jacques Rousseau and

00:00:05.348 --> 00:00:07.100
Émile.
 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:14.760
And interact with me today;
I need your help.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.520
I came back from Helsinki,
Finland yesterday.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.840
I was sixteen hours on the road.
 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.600
I went to bed at 1:00 a.m.
 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.350
So I need your help.
 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.020
I want you to interact with me.
 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.186
And Émile is a
good opportunity to interact and

00:00:30.186 --> 00:00:33.590
get excited because it's a very
important text.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.890
As I pointed out,
there is no educational theory

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.770
without Rousseau's
Émile.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.265
Everybody who does education
has to read Émile

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:46.390
from cover to cover.
 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.033
Most of them will disagree with
most of his ideas,

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:52.710
but will be provoked by his
ideas.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:00.018
He is intentionally
provocative, says things which

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:05.390
do upset you,
but makes you think;

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.659
and don't dismiss it too easy.
 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.920
Now before I go into
Émile,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.402
there is one more issue I would
like to come back--about

00:01:15.402 --> 00:01:18.500
Rousseau's Social
Contract.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.793
I made this point briefly in
the last lecture,

00:01:21.793 --> 00:01:25.820
but let me make it sharper
because in the questions I am

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.748
asking--
questions about the general

00:01:29.748 --> 00:01:36.638
will--and I feel I may not have
given enough meat to you about

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:40.480
the notion of the general will.
 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.191
Yeah, before I go--so I have to
come back because there is one

00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:49.000
more chore, household chore.
 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.610
One of the teaching fellows
reminded me that the Smith's

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.970
Lecture will come at the day
when the test is due.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.569
So what to do with this?
 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.346
&gt;
 

00:02:04.346 --> 00:02:09.324
What I suggest:
I will do a preview of Smith

00:02:09.324 --> 00:02:13.933
Thursday,
this week, and I will put my

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:20.698
PowerPoints before the lecture
on the internet so you can read

00:02:20.698 --> 00:02:22.472
the PowerPoints.
 

00:02:22.472 --> 00:02:23.470
Okay?
 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.370
That will get you up in speed.
 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.438
I hope you still will come to
the lecture.

00:02:30.438 --> 00:02:35.299
Though those of you who are
also in the Varieties of

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.919
Capitalism course can skip
because,

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.949
out of the 50 lectures I'm
giving this semester,

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:44.650
this is the only one which
overlaps.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.443
It is the same lecture what I
was giving in the Varieties of

00:02:48.443 --> 00:02:49.729
Capitalism course.
 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:54.830
I hope you won't ask for a
discount--that the professor did

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.470
sell the same product twice.
 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.908
But anyway, so those who did
that lecture and they feel very

00:03:04.908 --> 00:03:10.710
comfortable with Smith can miss
the lecture.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.520
But I hope everybody else will
come Tuesday.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.530
All right, now
Émile.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.801
This is something--no,
no, the general will,

00:03:22.801 --> 00:03:24.689
the general will.
 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:26.258
I didn't finish this one.
 

00:03:26.258 --> 00:03:31.655
So there is an interesting
contrast--development--in

00:03:31.655 --> 00:03:37.050
Rousseau in The Theory of
Social Contract.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:44.002
Because Rousseau especially
emphasizes that the social

00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:51.220
contract has to be arrived at by
a universal consent.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.866
So he does emphasize that in
arriving to a social contract we

00:03:57.866 --> 00:04:03.740
actually have to exercise some
popular sovereignty.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.310
And this is an idea which is
only an element in Locke.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.000
Right?
 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.098
In some ways Rousseau moves a
big step forward--

00:04:13.098 --> 00:04:17.040
contractarian theory,
towards democratic theory,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.692
popular sovereignty,
and, in fact,

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:21.379
universal suffrage.
 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:26.872
I mentioned he did not advocate
suffrage for women but advocated

00:04:26.872 --> 00:04:30.970
otherwise universal
suffrage--what Locke was not

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.540
willing to do.
 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.555
But there is an interesting
other idea in Rousseau which has

00:04:39.555 --> 00:04:45.216
an important kernel of truth,
and a very disturbing idea at

00:04:45.216 --> 00:04:49.091
the same time,
and this is the idea of the

00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:50.569
general will.
 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:57.214
I talked about this as a good
example of methodological

00:04:57.214 --> 00:05:01.507
collectivism;
that Rousseau,

00:05:01.507 --> 00:05:08.471
unlike Hobbes or Locke,
or we will see later on Mill or

00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:11.903
Adam Smith,
does not believe that studying

00:05:11.903 --> 00:05:16.514
the individual actions we can
understand what is society and

00:05:16.514 --> 00:05:19.250
what the need of the society is.
 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.815
There is a general will over
society which is more than

00:05:24.815 --> 00:05:28.939
simply adding up all individual
wills.

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:34.464
And this idea carried on in
social theory among those whom

00:05:34.464 --> 00:05:38.728
we will discuss,
particularly by Émile

00:05:38.728 --> 00:05:39.990
Durkheim.
 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.331
And there is clearly an element
of truth to it--that there is

00:05:45.331 --> 00:05:49.781
some universal good,
what is more than just the sum

00:05:49.781 --> 00:05:52.720
total of individual interest.
 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:06:00.065
When we are talking about
healthcare reform and the needs

00:06:00.065 --> 00:06:07.149
of governments to provide
healthcare for everybody,

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:12.120
when we actually do believe
that it should not be left to

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.827
individual responsibility
whether they have healthcare

00:06:16.827 --> 00:06:18.069
insurance.
 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:20.589
Or at least some people in this
room probably believe that.

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:27.398
Then you believe that there is
a general will--that you have to

00:06:27.398 --> 00:06:32.339
overrule the individual to make
a decision.

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:34.810
And there is this general will
everywhere.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.555
When you go to the college,
you have to get certain shots

00:06:37.555 --> 00:06:39.959
otherwise you are not allowed
into the college.

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:46.271
It is not leaving up to you to
decide whether you have certain

00:06:46.271 --> 00:06:47.720
shots taken.
 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.240
You have to demonstrate,
to be in residence.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.670
There is a general will.
 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.865
It's not assumed that every
individual is a rational actor

00:06:56.865 --> 00:07:01.355
and people will not be foolish
and be irresponsible and not to

00:07:01.355 --> 00:07:03.269
be properly protected.
 

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:04.220
You see?
 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.685
This is a strong case that the
idea of general will makes

00:07:07.685 --> 00:07:08.057
sense.
 

00:07:08.057 --> 00:07:10.100
There is some collective good.
 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.666
But we can understand that
individuals occasionally have to

00:07:15.666 --> 00:07:21.329
be forced to go by this general
will, by the public good.

00:07:21.329 --> 00:07:25.250
But there is a big problem with
the general will;

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.790
namely, if there is a general
will as such,

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.740
where on earth will it come
from?

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.449
How we will know what the
general will is?

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:38.769
And Rousseau is explicit about
this.

00:07:38.769 --> 00:07:40.670
He confronts it.
 

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.990
That's why he talks about the
lawgiver.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.959
He said, "Smart people
like me,

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:49.254
we know what is good for
society and therefore we should

00:07:49.254 --> 00:07:51.589
figure out what the general will
is,

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:56.692
and then the popularly elected
parliament will pass it as a

00:07:56.692 --> 00:07:57.220
law.
 

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.230
But we are the lawgivers."
 

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.910
Right?
 

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.720
Well this is a very disturbing
idea--

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:10.206
a disturbing idea which opens
Rousseau up to a totalitarian

00:08:10.206 --> 00:08:14.279
interpretation--
that he argues that the

00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:16.519
government knows better.
 

00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:19.425
And, in fact,
he argues that not the

00:08:19.425 --> 00:08:23.079
government but we,
the wise philosophers--we,

00:08:23.079 --> 00:08:27.728
the intellectuals--we know
better what people's interests

00:08:27.728 --> 00:08:28.560
are.
 

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.290
"You think this is your
interest?

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.058
No, I tell you,
this is not your interest.

00:08:33.058 --> 00:08:35.658
I know what is your
interest."

00:08:35.658 --> 00:08:38.538
Well, this is a very disturbing
idea.

00:08:38.538 --> 00:08:41.970
How on earth do I know what is
in your interest?

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:47.139
And, of course,
Rousseau's notion of general

00:08:47.139 --> 00:08:54.113
will appealed a great deal to
Karl Marx and Vladimir Ilyich

00:08:54.113 --> 00:08:57.360
Lenin and Mao Tse-tung.
 

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.913
They loved the idea that it is
the Central Committee of the

00:09:01.913 --> 00:09:06.937
Communist Party who knows better
than ordinary Chinese or Russian

00:09:06.937 --> 00:09:08.899
what their needs are.
 

00:09:08.899 --> 00:09:13.173
There must be a central planner
rather than an individual actor

00:09:13.173 --> 00:09:16.070
which tells people what their
needs are.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:20.697
So the problem of general will
is highly problematic.

00:09:20.697 --> 00:09:21.408
Right?
 

00:09:21.408 --> 00:09:26.008
You can make a case for it,
that you need an assumption

00:09:26.008 --> 00:09:27.028
like that.
 

00:09:27.028 --> 00:09:30.745
As I pointed out,
there are people in this room

00:09:30.745 --> 00:09:34.947
who believe that there is
general will and the common

00:09:34.947 --> 00:09:35.351
good.
 

00:09:35.351 --> 00:09:36.240
Right?
 

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.570
Are there people here?
 

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:42.308
Anybody believes that?
 

00:09:42.308 --> 00:09:44.596
Okay, yeah, yeah,
there are people in this

00:09:44.596 --> 00:09:45.600
room--of course.
 

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.440
And there are others who would
not believe that.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.767
If you are an econ major,
I think you got enough in

00:09:54.767 --> 00:09:56.763
economics to say,
"No, no,

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:58.759
no, no, never,
ever."

00:09:58.759 --> 00:10:02.816
Okay, now let's go to
Émile because it

00:10:02.816 --> 00:10:07.269
actually has something to do,
in a different formulation,

00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:09.100
with the same idea.
 

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.740
So what is the story about
Émile?

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:19.230
It's, of course--he himself is
Jean Jacques,

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:25.519
and he tells us that he's a
tutor of a boy,

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:29.945
Émile,
and educates him from the early

00:10:29.945 --> 00:10:34.673
ages until reaches adulthood and
finds his wife,

00:10:34.673 --> 00:10:35.779
Sophie.
 

00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:40.482
I told you, of course,
that this is a very idealized

00:10:40.482 --> 00:10:43.826
Rousseau,
because he put all of his

00:10:43.826 --> 00:10:47.913
children into an orphanage--
into a very lousy

00:10:47.913 --> 00:10:51.340
orphanage--and probably most of
them,

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.870
or all of them,
very early died in this

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.668
orphanage.
 

00:10:54.668 --> 00:11:00.548
But he still has ideas--what he
should have done if he would not

00:11:00.548 --> 00:11:04.840
have been a bastard
&gt;

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.740
and would not have abandoned
his children.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.908
So what is the Table of
Contents?

00:11:09.908 --> 00:11:14.644
First he says,
"Well we have to rear a

00:11:14.644 --> 00:11:19.719
civilized savage,
a child born in the state of

00:11:19.719 --> 00:11:23.191
nature;
infancy and childhood and

00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:28.547
pre-adolescence is a gradual
transformation from the state of

00:11:28.547 --> 00:11:30.600
nature into society.
 

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:36.474
Then when adolescence comes,
then we have a fully formed

00:11:36.474 --> 00:11:41.815
atomic individual by now,
and we have to bring that

00:11:41.815 --> 00:11:45.019
person into society."
 

00:11:45.019 --> 00:11:51.072
And then he has this very
complicated idea that this

00:11:51.072 --> 00:11:57.720
transition from the atomic
individual and state of nature

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:04.722
to civil society is a transition
from amour de soi to

00:12:04.722 --> 00:12:07.808
amour propre.
 

00:12:07.808 --> 00:12:14.558
Well this is a very complex
concept.

00:12:14.558 --> 00:12:19.671
Rousseau could have been more
lucid about what the difference

00:12:19.671 --> 00:12:21.120
is than he was.
 

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:27.368
Also, from English you think
you understand it more easily

00:12:27.368 --> 00:12:33.068
than you actually do,
because propre in French

00:12:33.068 --> 00:12:35.809
does not mean proper.
 

00:12:35.809 --> 00:12:42.029
Propre also means myself;
propre only means myself

00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:44.389
in consideration with others.
 

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:49.679
Soi means myself without
consideration of others.

00:12:49.679 --> 00:12:50.450
Right?
 

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:51.960
So be careful.
 

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:57.559
Amour-propre is not
proper love.

00:12:57.559 --> 00:12:58.740
Right?
 

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:03.183
It is a self-love,
but of a self-love in which I

00:13:03.183 --> 00:13:06.873
do take into consideration
alter,

00:13:06.873 --> 00:13:11.980
not only ego,
to put it with Sigmund Freud.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:18.277
Well and it has to happen,
otherwise we will not have

00:13:18.277 --> 00:13:19.610
citizens.
 

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:23.533
He links this idea of amour
propre--I will have to talk

00:13:23.533 --> 00:13:26.428
about this more--in order to
have citizens.

00:13:26.428 --> 00:13:31.048
And he makes a crucial
distinction between the citizens

00:13:31.048 --> 00:13:32.759
and the bourgeois.
 

00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:37.649
This is again the two faces of
Rousseau.

00:13:37.649 --> 00:13:43.065
One face of Rousseau is a
radical democrat,

00:13:43.065 --> 00:13:50.672
a deeply democratic individual,
and the other face is a left

00:13:50.672 --> 00:13:52.220
radical.
 

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:56.889
And he's the first really,
as far as I can tell--

00:13:56.889 --> 00:14:01.210
but I reasonably know the
literature of these times--

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:05.782
the first who is using the term
bourgeois in a pejorative

00:14:05.782 --> 00:14:08.424
way,
and makes this crucial

00:14:08.424 --> 00:14:12.600
distinction between citizen and
bourgeois.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:19.419
And bourgeois are the selfish
businessmen who want to have

00:14:19.419 --> 00:14:26.360
money and do not have a
commitment to the collectivity--

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:33.450
who do not obey the general
will but pursue selfish,

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.730
narrow, economic interest.
 

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.424
That's bourgeois.
 

00:14:37.424 --> 00:14:41.712
In some ways he gives the tool
to Karl Marx,

00:14:41.712 --> 00:14:46.700
to develop his theory,
as we will see later on.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.200
And Marx, of course,
loved Rousseau;

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.726
not only Marx,
Durkheim loved Rousseau as

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:53.168
well.
 

00:14:53.168 --> 00:14:57.799
There are many people who loved
this character,

00:14:57.799 --> 00:15:02.230
despite his shortcomings of his
character.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.769
Well what are the main themes?
 

00:15:05.769 --> 00:15:09.509
The first important theme is
nature is good;

00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:11.970
society which is corrupt.
 

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:17.769
A very important proposition,
a very powerful proposition.

00:15:17.769 --> 00:15:22.524
This is something what Marx
also takes from Rousseau,

00:15:22.524 --> 00:15:27.370
and this is what Durkheim also
takes from Rousseau.

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:32.183
"Fear of death is not
natural,"

00:15:32.183 --> 00:15:33.990
he continues.
 

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:39.315
"It is forced on
us--forced on us by priests,

00:15:39.315 --> 00:15:42.250
philosophers and doctors.
 

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:46.330
And the first task is negative
education."

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.860
Well I will elaborate on this.
 

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.740
I'll just foreshadow this block
of ideas.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.985
The second one is:
well the task is to turn the

00:15:55.985 --> 00:15:59.509
savages,
noble savages--that's the noble

00:15:59.509 --> 00:16:02.437
savage,
a very Rousseauian idea--into

00:16:02.437 --> 00:16:06.152
social beings,
and from amour de soi to

00:16:06.152 --> 00:16:07.820
amour propre.
 

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:14.500
Well but what makes us
social--it's a lovely idea;

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:18.548
provocative,
ironic, and I just love

00:16:18.548 --> 00:16:22.600
it--what makes us social is
pity.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.330
And I will labor on this.
 

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.629
It's really so wonderful.
 

00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:36.912
And the big question is can we
be citizens without being

00:16:36.912 --> 00:16:38.720
bourgeois?
 

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.730
What is the distinction?
 

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:43.870
And then he said,
"What is

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.070
civilization?"
 

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:52.714
Well civilization becomes
culture when sex is sublimated

00:16:52.714 --> 00:16:55.009
into imagination.
 

00:16:55.009 --> 00:16:56.899
It's very important.
 

00:16:56.899 --> 00:17:01.682
I will labor on it,
and I hope you will be able to

00:17:01.682 --> 00:17:04.611
relate to it as much as I can.
 

00:17:04.611 --> 00:17:05.490
Right?
 

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:11.417
He said there are really two
processes which makes us social:

00:17:11.417 --> 00:17:13.000
pity and love.
 

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.058
But not sex.
 

00:17:15.058 --> 00:17:19.785
It is erotic love,
which is in your mind as much

00:17:19.785 --> 00:17:22.500
as in your sexual drives.
 

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:27.470
And then he suggests love
develops in three stages.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:32.910
And I think this is absolutely
wonderful.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:42.480
Again, certainly I can relate
to this very well.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:49.228
The first stage is that you are
in love but you don't know yet

00:17:49.228 --> 00:17:50.334
with whom.
 

00:17:50.334 --> 00:17:51.328
Right?
 

00:17:51.328 --> 00:17:55.327
You are ready for love and you
are looking for somebody to be

00:17:55.327 --> 00:17:55.858
loved.
 

00:17:55.858 --> 00:17:59.500
But you don't really know yet,
you did not identify yet.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:03.980
But there is a sense that you
are in love.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:08.480
Well, it happens certainly for
the first time in adolescence.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.356
When we are thirteen or
fourteen, and we suddenly

00:18:12.356 --> 00:18:16.961
realize that there is romantic
stuff but we don't have the

00:18:16.961 --> 00:18:21.950
object of our romantic feelings,
we have to find this out.

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:26.528
But it happens actually always
when one falls in love.

00:18:26.528 --> 00:18:30.800
Can I tell you as an old man,
it will happen later to life as

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:31.298
well.
 

00:18:31.298 --> 00:18:33.962
There is rarely one love in
life.

00:18:33.962 --> 00:18:34.630
Right?
 

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:43.097
Okay, then he says love brings
different people together on the

00:18:43.097 --> 00:18:46.240
basis of differences.
 

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:51.339
This is very much a Durkheimian
idea of what binds people

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:54.618
together can be their
differences.

00:18:54.618 --> 00:19:00.179
And he makes a very provocative
argument: men and women are

00:19:00.179 --> 00:19:01.328
different.
 

00:19:01.328 --> 00:19:06.769
He's mostly read as a male
chauvinist bastard.

00:19:06.769 --> 00:19:10.240
But it's more complicated than
this,

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:14.440
and I will show you text what
will make you think,

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:19.353
without completely dismissing
him, just on some very damaging

00:19:19.353 --> 00:19:21.880
quotations--
what I also will show you.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.630
All right, so nature good,
society corrupts.

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:33.588
Well people in nature are good;
society corrupts.

00:19:33.588 --> 00:19:39.529
Well this is the opposite
argument to Hobbes.

00:19:39.529 --> 00:19:46.404
Or, in fact,
Durkheim's idea that you need

00:19:46.404 --> 00:19:55.458
more control over society is
also opposed to Rousseau's

00:19:55.458 --> 00:19:58.980
fundamental idea.
 

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:03.013
And he said,
well a child does not know vice

00:20:03.013 --> 00:20:05.358
and doesn't know error.
 

00:20:05.358 --> 00:20:10.298
It is introduced to the child
by society.

00:20:10.298 --> 00:20:14.940
And then he gives--though he
was not much of a believer--

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:20.538
he gives a bit of theological
argument: "Everything is

00:20:20.538 --> 00:20:25.752
good as it leaves the hands of
the author of things and

00:20:25.752 --> 00:20:30.868
everything degenerates in the
hands of man."

00:20:30.868 --> 00:20:36.608
"Man turns everything
upside down.

00:20:36.608 --> 00:20:40.660
He wants nothing as nature made
it."

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:47.990
We are being told to get rid of
our natural instincts.

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:52.868
And this is again lovely, right?
 

00:20:52.868 --> 00:20:58.390
"Man must be trained like
a school horse."

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.960
So it's lovely.
 

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:07.556
Also I think you sense this
very important distinction

00:21:07.556 --> 00:21:10.828
between training and education.
 

00:21:10.828 --> 00:21:11.778
Right?
 

00:21:11.778 --> 00:21:16.118
Once I had a conversation with
Daniel Bell,

00:21:16.118 --> 00:21:20.868
a famous social scientist,
and he said--

00:21:20.868 --> 00:21:23.380
we were talking about graduate
students--

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.673
and he said,
"My colleagues are always

00:21:25.673 --> 00:21:28.349
talking about training graduate
students."

00:21:28.349 --> 00:21:30.690
He said, "What an outrage.
 

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:34.009
You educate students,
you don't train them.

00:21:34.009 --> 00:21:36.380
You train a dog."
 

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.804
Now that's Rousseau's point.
 

00:21:38.804 --> 00:21:39.410
Right?
 

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:44.616
Training, simply to giving
skills and telling them how to

00:21:44.616 --> 00:21:46.849
do things is training.
 

00:21:46.849 --> 00:21:48.940
The point is education.
 

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:53.230
And I hope we try to do in this
course a bit of education.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:57.165
That's why I don't emphasize
that you have to go back and

00:21:57.165 --> 00:22:00.190
memorize the citations from the
authors,

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:03.851
come in, and in the blue book
quickly copy in what you

00:22:03.851 --> 00:22:07.720
memorized and will immediately
forget after the test--

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.680
what you often are expected to
do.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.460
That is training.
 

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:17.144
Education is the process in
which we force you to think on

00:22:17.144 --> 00:22:18.049
your own.
 

00:22:18.049 --> 00:22:20.190
That is education.
 

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:24.847
And he said well the problem is
that there is too much training.

00:22:24.847 --> 00:22:25.440
Right?
 

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:31.593
Like cutting back the trees;
a French garden,

00:22:31.593 --> 00:22:38.354
they cut back everything what
grows to fit what they thought a

00:22:38.354 --> 00:22:40.460
beautiful image.
 

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.190
It is always non-natural.
 

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.690
And I also like this a great
deal.

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.538
Many of you will not agree with
this.

00:22:46.538 --> 00:22:49.500
He said, "Fear of death is
not natural.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.279
In nature one accepts it."
 

00:22:53.279 --> 00:22:58.631
And Rousseau agrees with Hobbes
we are indeed driven by the fear

00:22:58.631 --> 00:23:01.690
of death, but this is not
natural.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:05.900
He claims that an animal
accepts death.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:10.308
Well whether it is true or not,
that's another question.

00:23:10.308 --> 00:23:16.169
You may have seen your dog
dying, and you have seen fear in

00:23:16.169 --> 00:23:18.190
the eyes of a dog.
 

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:22.578
So I'm not so sure how correct
Rousseau's observation is.

00:23:22.578 --> 00:23:25.008
But there is an element of
truth to it.

00:23:25.008 --> 00:23:25.519
Right?
 

00:23:25.519 --> 00:23:28.846
That buffaloes when they know
it is time to die,

00:23:28.846 --> 00:23:33.165
they go on their own and they
lay down and wait for death in a

00:23:33.165 --> 00:23:34.369
peaceful way.
 

00:23:34.369 --> 00:23:36.798
That's what he suggests.
 

00:23:36.798 --> 00:23:37.193
He said.
 

00:23:37.193 --> 00:23:38.868
"What is put into
us"--

00:23:38.868 --> 00:23:41.670
and I think it's a wonderful,
deep idea--

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.880
"the fear of death by
philosophers,

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.150
doctors and priests."
 

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:49.009
A great idea. Right?
 

00:23:49.009 --> 00:23:51.516
It's a very important
idea--that we are ruled by

00:23:51.516 --> 00:23:54.450
people who monopolize a
different type of knowledge,

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:58.541
and the essence,
the power of knowledge is that

00:23:58.541 --> 00:24:01.298
it put fear of death into us.
 

00:24:01.298 --> 00:24:04.253
The doctors will say,
"Well I will cure

00:24:04.253 --> 00:24:05.558
you." Right?
 

00:24:05.558 --> 00:24:10.141
The priest will say,
"You will burn in

00:24:10.141 --> 00:24:11.558
hell."
 

00:24:11.558 --> 00:24:15.250
And therefore you will fear of
death.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:22.346
He said naturally we would know
how to suffer and how to die,

00:24:22.346 --> 00:24:28.851
but we are being sort of
indoctrinated to fear death and

00:24:28.851 --> 00:24:32.400
have anxieties in my life.
 

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.868
Well this is why we need
negative education.

00:24:36.868 --> 00:24:42.450
This is a very provocative idea
that became extremely popular in

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.308
the 1960s and '70s.
 

00:24:44.308 --> 00:24:48.780
Those of you who do education
probably know Ivan Illich's

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:53.131
work;
he's pushing it as far as you

00:24:53.131 --> 00:24:53.654
can.
 

00:24:53.654 --> 00:24:54.700
Right?
 

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.964
But in the kind of
counter-cultural educational

00:24:57.964 --> 00:25:02.226
theories it was very important
that what you need is negative

00:25:02.226 --> 00:25:03.220
education.
 

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:07.818
You have to get out of those
silly ideas from people's mind

00:25:07.818 --> 00:25:10.038
what society put in there.
 

00:25:10.038 --> 00:25:15.940
And he said--and this is again
a lovely citation--

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:20.490
"Our didactic and pedantic
craze is always to teach

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:25.618
children what they would learn
much better by themselves and to

00:25:25.618 --> 00:25:30.170
forget what we alone could teach
them." Right?

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:36.073
So this is again--education is
giving an opportunity for people

00:25:36.073 --> 00:25:40.262
to use their mind,
rather than indoctrinating

00:25:40.262 --> 00:25:41.118
them.
 

00:25:41.118 --> 00:25:47.073
"And therefore,"
he said, "the first act of

00:25:47.073 --> 00:25:51.355
education should be purely
negative."

00:25:51.355 --> 00:25:52.400
Right?
 

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:58.517
"It consists not at all in
teaching virtue and the truth

00:25:58.517 --> 00:26:03.817
but in securing the heart from
vice and the mind from

00:26:03.817 --> 00:26:05.450
error."
 

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.890
Very important. Right?
 

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:11.703
The task of education,
not training,

00:26:11.703 --> 00:26:14.838
is not to tell you what the
truth is.

00:26:14.838 --> 00:26:20.230
The task of education is to
help your brain operate

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:27.021
sufficiently to tell what is an
error and to figure out when you

00:26:27.021 --> 00:26:29.608
are making an error.
 

00:26:29.608 --> 00:26:35.210
That's why there is no easy
solutions.

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:38.808
There is no right answer to the
question.

00:26:38.808 --> 00:26:42.230
There are competing answers to
every important question.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:48.230
And the task of education is to
consider the pros and cons,

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:53.490
to consider what speaks for and
against the evidence,

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:58.410
and then to make a judgment
what is the proposition you will

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:01.328
accept to try to eliminate
error.

00:27:01.328 --> 00:27:03.920
That's what education is all
about.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:12.788
Okay, now another issue is
about command.

00:27:12.788 --> 00:27:17.027
And he said--and again I love
it--"There shall be no

00:27:17.027 --> 00:27:17.858
commands.
 

00:27:17.858 --> 00:27:22.455
The words obey and
command will be

00:27:22.455 --> 00:27:25.390
proscribed from the Lexicon.
 

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:30.170
And even more so duty
and obligation."

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:34.339
Very provocative,
but again I think very deep.

00:27:34.339 --> 00:27:36.130
Think about it very hard.
 

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:41.269
He said what we really should
be, in the process of education

00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:44.440
do, is to emphasize your
strengths.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:51.279
We emphasize necessity;
we emphasize impotence.

00:27:51.279 --> 00:27:55.241
We try to figure out what is
outside of our reach,

00:27:55.241 --> 00:27:56.858
what we cannot do.
 

00:27:56.858 --> 00:28:00.942
We emphasize constraints,
realistic constraints upon our

00:28:00.942 --> 00:28:01.461
action.
 

00:28:01.461 --> 00:28:02.130
Right?
 

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:08.818
That is really what should
happen in education.

00:28:08.818 --> 00:28:12.734
So the argument,
this is your duty to do

00:28:12.734 --> 00:28:16.277
that, is the wrong way to
approach.

00:28:16.277 --> 00:28:17.210
Right?
 

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:23.507
It's not what the educators
should do--to appeal to people's

00:28:23.507 --> 00:28:27.990
guilt feelings,
to create guilt in them.

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:32.548
We will talk about this more in
Nietzsche--where the guilt

00:28:32.548 --> 00:28:34.630
feelings is coming from.
 

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:37.980
No, don't create guilt.
 

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:43.647
But, on the other hand,
tell people what is necessary,

00:28:43.647 --> 00:28:48.140
what are the limitations of
your action.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:51.538
Emphasize what you are capable
of doing.

00:28:51.538 --> 00:28:55.307
Encourage them to get the best
out of them, but always warn

00:28:55.307 --> 00:28:59.400
them that, "I don't see
that you can really go that far.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.892
Don't push yourself too much
because you won't be able to

00:29:02.892 --> 00:29:03.890
make it."
 

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.130
That's what he believes
education is.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:10.452
Now this is turning savages
into social beings,

00:29:10.452 --> 00:29:15.808
moving from amour de soi
to amour propre.

00:29:15.808 --> 00:29:19.858
The love of oneself,
amour de soi,

00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:21.578
is always good.
 

00:29:21.578 --> 00:29:26.038
There is nothing wrong about
it--what Adam Smith will call

00:29:26.038 --> 00:29:27.288
self-interest.
 

00:29:27.288 --> 00:29:34.250
Well the child is born with
amour de soi.

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:38.290
Takes the toy away,
"It's mine."

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:39.078
Right?
 

00:29:39.078 --> 00:29:42.231
The other child will say,
"No, this is mine."

00:29:42.231 --> 00:29:42.700
Right?
 

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.769
This is amour de soi.
 

00:29:44.769 --> 00:29:47.410
I want it. Right?
 

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:55.450
Amour de soi,
as we will know from Freud.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:57.839
I want the breast of my mother.
 

00:29:57.839 --> 00:30:02.190
I want to monopolize it;
this is mine. Right?

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:04.818
That's amour de soi.
 

00:30:04.818 --> 00:30:11.570
Well but on the other hand we
have to extend our

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:16.096
relationships;
we have to interact with other

00:30:16.096 --> 00:30:16.690
people.
 

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:22.304
And amour propre will be
when we realize there is another

00:30:22.304 --> 00:30:26.759
people who are also led by
amour de soi,

00:30:26.759 --> 00:30:31.829
and we figure out the way how
to live with them,

00:30:31.829 --> 00:30:34.380
by interacting with them.
 

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:39.009
Well there are--where does
sociality then come from;

00:30:39.009 --> 00:30:41.318
amour propre,
where does it come from?

00:30:41.318 --> 00:30:45.088
And there are--the first maxim
is,

00:30:45.088 --> 00:30:50.487
"It is not the human heart
to put ourselves in the place of

00:30:50.487 --> 00:30:56.281
people who are happier than we,
but only of those who are more

00:30:56.281 --> 00:30:57.818
pitiable."
 

00:30:57.818 --> 00:31:04.205
It's ironic,
but as far as I can tell this

00:31:04.205 --> 00:31:07.478
is ad hominem.
 

00:31:07.478 --> 00:31:08.880
Right?
 

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.930
Think just very honestly about
yourself.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:18.257
When you know somebody was more
successful with you,

00:31:18.257 --> 00:31:22.434
you can't--very hard to love
that person.

00:31:22.434 --> 00:31:23.480
Right?
 

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:28.849
If somebody is less successful
than you, you feel pity for

00:31:28.849 --> 00:31:29.509
them.
 

00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:33.789
Suddenly your heart warms up.
 

00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:36.640
Suddenly you feel responsible.
 

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.019
Suddenly you want to help.
 

00:31:40.019 --> 00:31:40.930
Right?
 

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:46.115
The second maxim:
"One pities in the others

00:31:46.115 --> 00:31:51.743
only those ills from which one
does not feel oneself

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:53.618
exempt."
 

00:31:53.618 --> 00:32:00.066
So we don't necessarily lead by
love when we see misery what is

00:32:00.066 --> 00:32:04.848
sort of outside of our possible
experiences.

00:32:04.848 --> 00:32:08.930
We have love for pitiable
people when we think we can

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:12.068
actually end up in the same
situation.

00:32:12.068 --> 00:32:15.420
That's when we will have
amour propre.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:20.771
And the third maxim is,
well: "The pity one has

00:32:20.771 --> 00:32:26.858
for another's misfortune is
measured not by the quantity of

00:32:26.858 --> 00:32:32.105
that misfortune but the
sentiment one attributes to

00:32:32.105 --> 00:32:34.835
those who suffer it."
 

00:32:34.835 --> 00:32:36.200
Right?
 

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.930
So I think that's a wonderful
idea.

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:44.710
And now about compassion and
pity one more time.

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:47.348
He said, "We are born
twice,

00:32:47.348 --> 00:32:49.910
once to exist and the second
time to live"--

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:54.137
for species reproduction,
and "the young adult

00:32:54.137 --> 00:32:58.788
becomes sensitive before knowing
what he's sensing...

00:32:58.788 --> 00:33:02.613
It is now that man,
truly born to live"

00:33:02.613 --> 00:33:06.259
and beginning to experience the
others.

00:33:06.259 --> 00:33:12.221
So it is actually our weakness
what makes us social,

00:33:12.221 --> 00:33:14.558
not our strengths.
 

00:33:14.558 --> 00:33:18.732
"It is our common miseries
which turns our hearts to

00:33:18.732 --> 00:33:20.000
humanity."
 

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.259
I think really ironic but a
very deep idea.

00:33:24.259 --> 00:33:27.880
You can disagree with it,
but you have to think about it.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:32.730
There is clearly an element of
truth in the argument.

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:40.509
Okay, and I also love the last
sentence here.

00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:43.029
He said, "Pity is
sweet."

00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:46.963
This is one of my favorite
sentences in Rousseau.

00:33:46.963 --> 00:33:47.618
Right?
 

00:33:47.618 --> 00:33:52.618
It is so sweet to feel pity for
somebody.

00:33:52.618 --> 00:33:56.450
"Oh, I am so sorry for
you." Right?

00:33:56.450 --> 00:34:03.173
Then your heart is overflowing
with love.

00:34:03.173 --> 00:34:04.519
Right?
 

00:34:04.519 --> 00:34:09.460
Well and then the citizen and
the bourgeois.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:13.440
This is again fantastic.
 

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:19.469
"Pedaretus runs for
council of 300.

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:23.842
He is defeated"--not
elected in the 300

00:34:23.842 --> 00:34:26.690
representatives in Sparta.
 

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:34.222
He goes home delighted there
were 300 men worthier than he to

00:34:34.222 --> 00:34:36.860
be found in Sparta.
 

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.400
"This is the citizen."
 

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:48.378
Are you a citizen when you only
got a B- and there are thirty

00:34:48.378 --> 00:34:52.500
people in class who got an A?
 

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:57.943
Do you feel how fortunate I am
that I'm in such a great class

00:34:57.943 --> 00:35:01.481
that thirty people are better
than I am?

00:35:01.481 --> 00:35:02.389
Right?
 

00:35:02.389 --> 00:35:05.326
If you feel that way,
then you are a citizen.

00:35:05.326 --> 00:35:05.860
Right?
 

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:09.110
When you develop amour
propre;

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:11.969
that is his point.
 

00:35:11.969 --> 00:35:15.329
And then another point.
 

00:35:15.329 --> 00:35:21.096
"A Spartan woman had five
sons in the army and was waiting

00:35:21.096 --> 00:35:23.050
news of the battle.
 

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:27.702
A Helot arrives,
trembling, she asks him for

00:35:27.702 --> 00:35:28.460
news.
 

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:32.539
'Your five sons were killed.'
 

00:35:32.539 --> 00:35:34.280
And now she answers.
 

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.579
'Base slave,
did I ask you that?'

00:35:36.579 --> 00:35:39.690
'We won the victory.'
 

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:45.190
The mother runs to the temple
and gives thanks to the gods.

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:47.302
This is the female
citizen."

00:35:47.302 --> 00:35:47.829
Right?
 

00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:54.268
My children died,
but we won-- the general will.

00:35:54.268 --> 00:36:01.030
Well, "He who in a civil
order wants to preserve the

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:07.791
primacy of the sentiments of
nature does not know what he

00:36:07.791 --> 00:36:09.000
wants.
 

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.780
Always in contradiction with
himself...he will never be

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:18.119
either man or citizen...he will
be a bourgeois.

00:36:18.119 --> 00:36:20.000
He will be nothing."
 

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.739
That's what Karl Marx loved.
 

00:36:21.739 --> 00:36:28.070
People who just pursue their
own self-interest is not much.

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:33.480
Now men, women,
sexuality and love.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:37.940
Well, civilization becomes
culture when sex is sublimated;

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:41.940
bodily desire is turned into
imagination.

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:46.960
We will see that greatly
inspires Sigmund Freud.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:51.427
There are two mechanisms which
constitute social compassion:

00:36:51.427 --> 00:36:52.639
pity and love.
 

00:36:52.639 --> 00:36:58.822
And he also adds a very
provocative idea of his time and

00:36:58.822 --> 00:37:04.780
kind of foreshadows post-modern
thought: Enlightenment

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:08.039
demythologizes the world.
 

00:37:08.039 --> 00:37:13.559
Deprived from its meaning,
it's a cold rational world of

00:37:13.559 --> 00:37:16.771
the marketplace,
and competitive,

00:37:16.771 --> 00:37:21.344
isolated individuals;
that's what modern world

00:37:21.344 --> 00:37:23.409
Enlightenment produced.
 

00:37:23.409 --> 00:37:28.159
And the world became unerotic,
unpoetic.

00:37:28.159 --> 00:37:32.427
This is something which will
play a big role in Max Weber's

00:37:32.427 --> 00:37:36.253
idea of disenchantment,
or if you know Marcuse's

00:37:36.253 --> 00:37:39.914
wonderful book,
Eros and Civilization,

00:37:39.914 --> 00:37:42.460
comes straight out of Rousseau.
 

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:46.813
Rousseau wants to bring back
the erotic--not sex,

00:37:46.813 --> 00:37:48.989
the erotic experience.
 

00:37:48.989 --> 00:37:53.019
Well the love develops in three
stages.

00:37:53.019 --> 00:37:56.760
As I said quest--first is quest.
 

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.989
You are in love but you don't
know yet with whom.

00:37:59.989 --> 00:38:05.097
Again think back:
you were thirteen or fourteen,

00:38:05.097 --> 00:38:09.769
you began to search for
somebody to love.

00:38:09.769 --> 00:38:11.820
Then comes the discovery.
 

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.309
You found it.
 

00:38:13.309 --> 00:38:15.780
That's it, that's the person I
am in love with.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.559
Émile finds Sophie.
 

00:38:17.559 --> 00:38:19.795
What brings them together,
he said, is the

00:38:19.795 --> 00:38:22.360
differences--that they
complement each other.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:27.235
Durkheim will argue it can be
similarity what brings us

00:38:27.235 --> 00:38:28.230
together.
 

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:34.110
It's a more complex argument,
but the origin of the idea is

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:35.530
in Rousseau.
 

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:37.230
Then comes the important part.
 

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:40.449
Once you fall in love,
don't rush.

00:38:40.449 --> 00:38:46.949
As I said, not sex,
eros is what he's believing.

00:38:46.949 --> 00:38:48.710
Leave, right?
 

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:50.949
Don't rush to bed.
 

00:38:50.949 --> 00:38:54.688
Go to travel,
and then when you travel you

00:38:54.688 --> 00:38:57.789
think about the person you love.
 

00:38:57.789 --> 00:39:02.146
You idealize that person in
your mind, and that's when this

00:39:02.146 --> 00:39:04.849
love becomes an erotic
experience.

00:39:04.849 --> 00:39:09.018
Then you can go home and you
can consume the love.

00:39:09.018 --> 00:39:09.699
Right?
 

00:39:09.699 --> 00:39:13.369
I think this is really
wonderful.

00:39:13.369 --> 00:39:20.579
Well, and here comes a problem:
his views on gender relations.

00:39:20.579 --> 00:39:28.056
Well men and women are
different, and that means that

00:39:28.056 --> 00:39:33.518
they ought to be taught
differently.

00:39:33.518 --> 00:39:40.568
"If you would
decide,"

00:39:40.568 --> 00:39:45.922
he said,
"to raise women like

00:39:45.922 --> 00:39:51.242
men," he said,
"men will gladly consent

00:39:51.242 --> 00:39:52.150
to this.
 

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:58.523
The more women want to resemble
men, the less women will govern

00:39:58.523 --> 00:39:59.860
them."
 

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:04.590
Well you can say it's a pretty
sexist observation,

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:08.164
but probably an idea you heard
before.

00:40:08.164 --> 00:40:09.130
Right?
 

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:13.230
Who wears the hat in the family?
 

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:18.447
This is the kind of argument,
that women are the bosses after

00:40:18.447 --> 00:40:18.969
all.
 

00:40:18.969 --> 00:40:25.929
Well therefore what the
education should do:

00:40:25.929 --> 00:40:35.802
cultivate men's qualities--not
to cultivate men's qualities in

00:40:35.802 --> 00:40:41.630
women, but raise it differently.
 

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:44.967
Well, and here are the
citations which shows you

00:40:44.967 --> 00:40:46.530
Rousseau the sexist.
 

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:52.860
Hard to say he's not a sexist
bastard, right?

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.250
&gt;
 

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:57.090
"Woman is made specially
to please men."

00:40:57.090 --> 00:41:02.092
Well I'm sure at least half of
the men in this room are also

00:41:02.092 --> 00:41:07.179
outraged, and I think probably
all the women are outraged.

00:41:07.179 --> 00:41:10.778
But I hope there are other men
in this room,

00:41:10.778 --> 00:41:14.630
not only me,
who is upset by this statement.

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:18.137
Well he said,
"Women and men are made

00:41:18.137 --> 00:41:22.072
for one another,
but their mutual dependence is

00:41:22.072 --> 00:41:23.268
not equal.
 

00:41:23.268 --> 00:41:26.929
Men depend on women because of
their desires;

00:41:26.929 --> 00:41:32.570
women depend on men because of
both their desires and their

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:33.349
needs.
 

00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:37.963
We would survive more easily
without them than they would

00:41:37.963 --> 00:41:39.530
without us."
 

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:41.489
I mean me, man.
 

00:41:41.489 --> 00:41:44.480
This is of course straight
silly, right?

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:48.039
I was widowed for awhile.
 

00:41:48.039 --> 00:41:52.413
I know how much more difficult
it is for a man to survive

00:41:52.413 --> 00:41:57.099
without a woman than for a woman
to survive without a man.

00:41:57.099 --> 00:42:01.762
Well and then he goes on:
"Almost all little girls

00:42:01.762 --> 00:42:05.389
learn to read and write with
repugnance.

00:42:05.389 --> 00:42:11.670
But as far as holding a needle,
that they always learn gladly.

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:15.920
Sewing, embroidery and lace
making come by themselves."

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:19.860
So nothing more should be said.
 

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:22.829
But there are other citations.
 

00:42:22.829 --> 00:42:24.409
Read this one.
 

00:42:24.409 --> 00:42:28.849
And there are some
post-feminists who actually like

00:42:28.849 --> 00:42:32.670
this Rousseau,
who says men and women should

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:34.179
be different.
 

00:42:34.179 --> 00:42:38.916
He said, "Sophie ought to
be a woman as Émile is a

00:42:38.916 --> 00:42:39.849
man."
 

00:42:39.849 --> 00:42:42.809
And then he goes further.
 

00:42:42.809 --> 00:42:47.157
He said, "In everything
not connected with sex,

00:42:47.157 --> 00:42:49.119
woman is a man."
 

00:42:49.119 --> 00:42:53.253
In some ways he's formulating
the idea of the gender.

00:42:53.253 --> 00:42:53.889
Right?
 

00:42:53.889 --> 00:42:58.190
Gender equality,
sexual differences;

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:00.018
that's what he said.
 

00:43:00.018 --> 00:43:05.769
The problem is if women try to
look sex-wise like they were

00:43:05.769 --> 00:43:06.166
men.
 

00:43:06.166 --> 00:43:07.059
Right?
 

00:43:07.059 --> 00:43:11.480
That's, I think,
an interesting idea.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.780
And then he said,
"Everything men and women

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:15.789
have in common belongs to the
species,

00:43:15.789 --> 00:43:18.847
the human species,
and everything which

00:43:18.847 --> 00:43:22.228
distinguishes them belongs
simply to sexual

00:43:22.228 --> 00:43:24.000
differences."
 

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.556
And then he said,
"In the union of sexes

00:43:28.556 --> 00:43:34.978
each contributes equally to the
common aim, but not in the same

00:43:34.978 --> 00:43:36.429
way."
 

00:43:36.429 --> 00:43:47.539
Well I will suspect that most
of you will see him as a sexist.

00:43:47.539 --> 00:43:54.324
But some of you may actually
see the points what he's making

00:43:54.324 --> 00:43:58.119
in this last set of quotations.
 

00:43:58.119 --> 00:44:00.269
Thank you.
 

00:44:00.269 --> 00:44:06.000

00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.869
Professor Christine
Hayes: Okay,

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:05.631
so having studied Job,
we've seen that the Bible is

00:00:05.631 --> 00:00:08.670
not a book with a single uniform
style and message.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.696
It's an anthology of diverse
works that may have different,

00:00:12.696 --> 00:00:14.710
conflicting points of view.
 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.667
So the conventional religious
piety of Proverbs,

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:21.570
the firm belief in a system of
divine reward and punishment,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.480
that's so important to the
Deuteronomist--this is

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.420
challenged by the Book of Job.
 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.415
Job concludes that there is no
justice--not in this world,

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:30.730
not in any other world.
 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.164
Nevertheless,
Job feels that he is not

00:00:33.164 --> 00:00:36.060
excused from the task of
righteous living.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.043
And it's a wonderful and
fortuitous fact of history that

00:00:39.043 --> 00:00:42.351
Jewish sages chose to include
all of these dissonant voices in

00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:44.630
the canon of the Hebrew Bible
without,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.647
for the most part,
striving to reconcile the

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:49.920
conflicts.
I mention this because I hope

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.190
it will help you in writing your
final paper.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.549
Careful exegesis of the
biblical text--which is part of

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:59.219
your task in these papers (I'll
come back in a minute to the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.204
other part of your
task)--careful exegesis of the

00:01:02.204 --> 00:01:05.875
biblical text requires you to
set aside your presuppositions

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:10.234
and to attend to the many,
complex and often conflicting

00:01:10.234 --> 00:01:11.860
details of the text.
 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.540
Some of the other
presuppositions that you need to

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.878
set aside when you write this
paper are presuppositions that I

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:20.450
mentioned at the very outset of
the course,

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.480
but it might be wise to mention
a few of them again.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.304
The first is,
and I hope you've seen by now,

00:01:26.304 --> 00:01:30.179
that the Bible is not a set of
stories about saints or pious

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.120
people who always say and do
what is right or exemplary.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.519
Even the Bible's heroes are
human, they're not superhuman.

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:42.030
Their behavior can be confused,
it can be immoral;

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.696
and if we try to vindicate
biblical characters merely

00:01:44.696 --> 00:01:46.849
because their names appear in
the Bible,

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:50.011
we can miss the moral dilemma
that's being set out by the

00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:52.177
writer.
We can miss the psychological

00:01:52.177 --> 00:01:53.720
complexity of the stories.
 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.776
So when you do these papers,
put yourself in the place of

00:01:56.776 --> 00:01:59.420
the character.
In other words, humanize them.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.359
Think of them as acting in ways
you might act.

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:05.156
Think about their likely
feelings, their likely

00:02:05.156 --> 00:02:06.980
motivations as human beings.
 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.143
Secondly, remember that the
Bible isn't a manual of

00:02:09.143 --> 00:02:11.196
religion.
It's not a book of systematic

00:02:11.196 --> 00:02:13.261
theology.
It doesn't set out certain

00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:16.011
dogmas about God,
and you need to be careful not

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:19.264
to impose upon the Bible,
theological ideas and beliefs

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:22.103
that arose centuries after the
bulk of the Bible was

00:02:22.103 --> 00:02:24.769
written--for example,
a belief in a heaven and a hell

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.085
as a system of reward or
punishment, or the belief in a

00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:28.629
God that doesn't change his
mind.

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.040
The character Yahweh in the
Bible changes his mind;

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.509
it's just a fact of the text.
 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:35.682
If we wish to understand the
Bible on its own terms and in

00:02:35.682 --> 00:02:38.242
its own context,
then we have to be prepared to

00:02:38.242 --> 00:02:41.359
find ideas in it that may
conflict with later theological

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.139
notions that we hold dear.
 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.199
Don't assume you're going to
agree with the Bible.

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:48.139
Don't assume that the Bible
will agree with itself.

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:52.242
So then, coming to your paper
assignments--You've been asked,

00:02:52.242 --> 00:02:56.360
in the final paper assignment,
to develop an interpretation of

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.910
a passage, and the task of
interpretation for the purposes

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.090
of this class is not excavative.
 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.658
In other words,
you're not asked to analyze

00:03:04.658 --> 00:03:08.388
sources or to account for how
the text reached its final form,

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:10.319
right?
Source criticism.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.052
You're to look at the final
form of the text and give a

00:03:13.052 --> 00:03:16.190
plausible reading that makes the
best sense that you can out of

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.533
the details.
Whether you like the meaning or

00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:20.808
not, whether you agree with the
meaning or not,

00:03:20.808 --> 00:03:23.430
try to argue from the evidence
in the text itself.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.018
So you're going to be doing
what you're probably quite

00:03:26.018 --> 00:03:28.069
accustomed to doing in an
English class.

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.196
You're going to study the
text's language,

00:03:30.196 --> 00:03:31.700
its vocabulary,
its structure,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.360
its style, all of the clues.
 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.795
Look at the immediate context,
the larger context,

00:03:35.795 --> 00:03:38.379
the way vocabulary is used
elsewhere in the Bible,

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.296
similar vocabulary,
anything that might shed light

00:03:41.296 --> 00:03:44.569
on the passage's meaning or a
character's motivation,

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.443
and then you're going to weigh
the evidence and present your

00:03:47.443 --> 00:03:49.406
reading.
As in an English class,

00:03:49.406 --> 00:03:53.001
you'll want to minimize any
external assumptions that you

00:03:53.001 --> 00:03:56.018
bring to the text,
anything that's not supported

00:03:56.018 --> 00:03:58.886
by the text.
Often the text will be truly

00:03:58.886 --> 00:04:02.692
ambiguous, precisely because
there are gaps of information or

00:04:02.692 --> 00:04:06.879
there are hints that pull in two
different directions at times.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.539
That's part of the great
artistry of the biblical text.

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:11.960
That's what makes it so
interpretable.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.251
If that happens,
then you may want to present

00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:17.870
various, dueling
interpretations,

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.214
various plausible
interpretations of the passage

00:04:20.214 --> 00:04:22.259
based on the evidence in the
text and say:

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.201
these sorts of things would
lead one to suppose that this is

00:04:25.201 --> 00:04:27.405
going on;
but on the other hand,

00:04:27.405 --> 00:04:30.712
these textual clues lead to the
following plausible

00:04:30.712 --> 00:04:33.160
interpretation of what's going
on.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.333
You'll find that the task of
interpretation is easier if you

00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:41.435
keep in mind the following
point: Not all statements in the

00:04:41.435 --> 00:04:44.761
Bible are equal.
When a story is being told,

00:04:44.761 --> 00:04:48.300
information conveyed by the
narrator is reliable.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.269
Speech attributed to God is
reliable.

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:55.452
The words of individual
characters are not necessarily

00:04:55.452 --> 00:04:57.538
reliable.
Characters can be wrong,

00:04:57.538 --> 00:05:00.177
they can be misguided,
they have limited perspectives

00:05:00.177 --> 00:05:02.410
and sometimes the narrator hints
as much.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.433
But the voice of the narrator
is privileged and that's part of

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:08.009
the game we play when we read
works of literature;

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.944
we accept facts that are
established by the narrator as

00:05:10.944 --> 00:05:13.010
facts that guide our
interpretation.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.680
So it was with the story of Job.
 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.524
The narrator established,
as a fact of the story,

00:05:18.524 --> 00:05:20.540
that Job is perfectly
righteous.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.220
That's in the narrator's voice
in the prose introduction.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.433
He states it explicitly;
he bolsters his statement by

00:05:26.433 --> 00:05:28.569
attributing the same assertion
to God.

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.123
And the narrator also
establishes as a fact of the

00:05:31.123 --> 00:05:34.249
story that Job is afflicted with
horrendous suffering that he

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:37.170
didn't deserve.
It's not a punishment for sin.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.155
And then he leaves the
characters to struggle with the

00:05:40.155 --> 00:05:43.252
implications.
Job's friends cling to the idea

00:05:43.252 --> 00:05:46.885
that God rewards and God
punishes and so anyone who

00:05:46.885 --> 00:05:48.920
suffers must have sinned.
 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.911
We, as readers,
know that they are wrong

00:05:50.911 --> 00:05:54.025
because of the narrative facts
established at the beginning of

00:05:54.025 --> 00:05:56.319
the story.
Job takes the other route.

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:59.159
He knows, as we do,
that he is innocent,

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.017
that he is not being punished
for sin and therefore he

00:06:03.017 --> 00:06:07.021
concludes that God doesn't
punish and reward at all--and

00:06:07.021 --> 00:06:09.060
that's a radical idea.
 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.156
That God punishes the wicked
and rewards the good in this

00:06:12.156 --> 00:06:15.529
life, even if a little delayed
sometimes is a fundamental idea

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:18.459
in much of the Bible that we
have studied so far.

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:21.110
It's going to get weaker in
some of the books we'll be

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.381
looking at.
But Job denies this idea and in

00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:28.779
doing so, he arrives at a
radical moral conclusion.

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:32.147
The truly righteous man is
righteous for its own sake even

00:06:32.147 --> 00:06:35.750
if his righteousness brings him
nothing but suffering and pain

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.699
in this life or in any other.
 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:41.044
Remember that at the end of the
book the narrator has God state

00:06:41.044 --> 00:06:43.902
that Job is the one who has
spoken rightly and not his

00:06:43.902 --> 00:06:46.471
friends.
So be sure to consider point of

00:06:46.471 --> 00:06:48.269
view in your interpretation.
 

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:51.117
You wouldn't want to go in and
just lift something out of

00:06:51.117 --> 00:06:53.761
Bildad's mouth and say this is
what the Bible thinks,

00:06:53.761 --> 00:06:55.488
right?
Taking a verse right out of

00:06:55.488 --> 00:06:56.300
context that way.
 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.782
Don't assume that every
character in the Bible is

00:06:58.782 --> 00:07:01.316
reliable, look to the
surrounding framework as you

00:07:01.316 --> 00:07:03.503
evaluate their deeds,
and their actions,

00:07:03.503 --> 00:07:05.240
and their speech,
and their views.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.630
Finally, don't be surprised if
after carefully looking at all

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.230
of those things a passage
remains ambiguous.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.320
Again, in those cases you might
want to detail the features that

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.350
would support interpretation A,
the features that would support

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.308
interpretation B,
or you might plump for one

00:07:19.308 --> 00:07:20.810
interpretation over the other.
 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.680
That's the first part of your
task.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.861
It will help you enormously--if
you do that right,

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:27.042
it will help you enormously
(and by "right" I mean

00:07:27.042 --> 00:07:29.065
thoroughly,
I don't mean "correct")--I mean

00:07:29.065 --> 00:07:31.775
"right" in the sense that if you
do it well and thoroughly then

00:07:31.775 --> 00:07:34.529
it will help you enormously in
the second part of your task,

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:36.947
which is to analyze a Jewish
and a Christian,

00:07:36.947 --> 00:07:39.199
(and a Christian,
not or;

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:41.897
a Jewish and a
Christian) interpretation of the

00:07:41.897 --> 00:07:45.001
passage particularly of whatever
key ambiguous point you might

00:07:45.001 --> 00:07:47.672
have found in it,
and try to understand how they

00:07:47.672 --> 00:07:50.769
are a reading of the text,
a genuine effort to deal with,

00:07:50.769 --> 00:07:53.153
to grapple with,
probably the very points of

00:07:53.153 --> 00:07:56.202
ambiguity that you yourself
found when you really delved

00:07:56.202 --> 00:07:58.504
into the text.
And as much as their answers

00:07:58.504 --> 00:08:00.740
may not be answers that you
would come up with,

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.345
they are still genuine readings
of the exact issues that bugged

00:08:04.345 --> 00:08:06.730
you when you analyzed the text
closely.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.149
Try to give an account of that.
 

00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:11.648
What is it that this
interpretation chooses to

00:08:11.648 --> 00:08:15.070
develop as it presents its
interpretation?

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.300
What is it suppressing?
 

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.370
What is this interpretation
suppressing?

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.699
What is it picking up on and
developing?

00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:23.276
You'll be sensitive to those
things because you will have

00:08:23.276 --> 00:08:25.899
invested the time yourself in
appreciating how complex the

00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:28.021
passage is.
So do understand that you need

00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:30.740
to do all of those things for
any of the four questions.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.854
Develop your own interpretation;
analyze a Jewish and a

00:08:33.854 --> 00:08:36.964
Christian interpretation of the
same passage,

00:08:36.964 --> 00:08:39.071
okay?
Now, there is debate among

00:08:39.071 --> 00:08:42.629
scholars over the date of the
Book of Job, as well as some of

00:08:42.629 --> 00:08:45.059
the other books of the
Ketuvim.

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:47.847
Ketuvim is a Hebrew word
that simply means writings,

00:08:47.847 --> 00:08:50.779
and it's the label or the name
that we use to refer now to the

00:08:50.779 --> 00:08:52.269
third section of the Bible.
 

00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:54.747
So we've talked about Torah,
Neviim or prophets,

00:08:54.747 --> 00:08:57.316
and now we're moving into the
Writings or we have already

00:08:57.316 --> 00:09:00.389
really moved into the Writings,
the third section of the Bible.

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:04.580
Most scholars would concur that
many of these books contain

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.542
older material,
but that the books reached

00:09:07.542 --> 00:09:10.915
their final form,
their final written form,

00:09:10.915 --> 00:09:13.809
only later, in the post-exilic
period.

00:09:13.809 --> 00:09:17.436
Now, if these books contain
material that predates the

00:09:17.436 --> 00:09:21.610
exile, is it legitimate for us
to speak of them and study them

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.690
as a response to the national
calamities,

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:29.207
particularly the destruction
and defeat and exile,

00:09:29.207 --> 00:09:31.455
587/586.
In answer to this question,

00:09:31.455 --> 00:09:34.301
we'll consider a relatively
recent approach to the study of

00:09:34.301 --> 00:09:37.010
the Bible.
It's an approach known as

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.750
canonical criticism.
 

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.756
Canonical criticism grew out of
a dissatisfaction with the

00:09:42.756 --> 00:09:46.481
scholarly focus on original
historical meanings to the

00:09:46.481 --> 00:09:50.487
exclusion of a consideration of
the function or meaning of

00:09:50.487 --> 00:09:54.705
biblical texts for believing
communities in various times and

00:09:54.705 --> 00:09:58.852
places--a dissatisfaction with
the focus on original context

00:09:58.852 --> 00:10:02.999
and original meaning to the
exclusion of any interest in how

00:10:02.999 --> 00:10:08.129
the text would have served a
given community at a later time,

00:10:08.129 --> 00:10:11.269
a community for which it was
canonical.

00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:14.197
At what point did these stories
and sources suddenly become

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:16.570
canonical and have authority for
communities?

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.570
And when they did,
how were they read and

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.019
understood and interpreted?
 

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:23.005
So the historical,
critical method was always

00:10:23.005 --> 00:10:27.007
primarily interested in what was
really said and done by the

00:10:27.007 --> 00:10:29.450
original, biblical contributors.
 

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:33.630
Canonical criticism assumes
that biblical texts were

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.379
generated, transmitted,
reworked, and preserved in

00:10:37.379 --> 00:10:40.256
communities for whom they were
authoritative,

00:10:40.256 --> 00:10:43.786
and that biblical criticism
should include study of how

00:10:43.786 --> 00:10:47.381
these texts functioned in the
believing communities that

00:10:47.381 --> 00:10:49.669
received and cherished them.
 

00:10:49.669 --> 00:10:53.740
So emphasis is on the final
received form of the text.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.190
much less interest in how it
got to be what it is;

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:01.160
more interest in what it is now
rather than the stages in its

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.380
development.
There's a greater interest and

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.501
emphasis in canonical criticism
on the function of that final

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:12.691
form of the text in the first
communities to receive it and on

00:11:12.691 --> 00:11:16.812
the processes of adaptation by
which that community and later

00:11:16.812 --> 00:11:20.727
communities would re-signify
earlier tradition to function

00:11:20.727 --> 00:11:23.750
authoritatively in a new
situation.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.562
So a canonical critic might
ask, for example:

00:11:26.562 --> 00:11:28.991
what meaning,
authority, or value did a

00:11:28.991 --> 00:11:32.251
biblical writer seek in a
tradition or story when he

00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:35.320
employed it in the final form of
his text?

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.573
What meaning,
authority, or value would a

00:11:37.573 --> 00:11:40.389
community, would his community
have found in it,

00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:43.519
and what meanings and values
would later communities find in

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:45.960
it when that text became
canonical for them?

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.860
How did they re-signify it to
be meaningful for them?

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.014
Why did religious communities
accept what they did as

00:11:53.014 --> 00:11:56.230
canonical rather than setting
certain things aside?

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.633
Why was something chosen as
canonical and meaningful for

00:11:59.633 --> 00:12:02.169
them when it came from an
earlier time?

00:12:02.169 --> 00:12:06.035
So I propose that we adopt this
approach for many of the books

00:12:06.035 --> 00:12:08.379
in this third section of the
Bible.

00:12:08.379 --> 00:12:11.833
We look at the Bible through
the eyes of the post-exilic

00:12:11.833 --> 00:12:15.600
community, for whom they were
canonical--at least in part.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.583
We won't do this for everything
but I'm going to be coming back

00:12:18.583 --> 00:12:21.230
to this approach many times in
the last few lectures,

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:24.658
because in this way it becomes
possible for us to understand

00:12:24.658 --> 00:12:27.679
these books as a response to the
national history.

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:30.442
Not in their genesis or origin
(they weren't written

00:12:30.442 --> 00:12:33.746
necessarily as responses to the
national history--some of them

00:12:33.746 --> 00:12:36.888
may even pre-date the exile) but
in the fact that they were

00:12:36.888 --> 00:12:39.705
adopted or cherished as
meaningful by the post-exilic

00:12:39.705 --> 00:12:42.218
community.
So whatever the circumstances

00:12:42.218 --> 00:12:45.029
of their origin and final
redaction might have been,

00:12:45.029 --> 00:12:47.571
many of the books of the
ketuvim,

00:12:47.571 --> 00:12:50.307
of the Writings,
eventually would serve the

00:12:50.307 --> 00:12:54.347
post-exilic community as a prism
through which to view Israel's

00:12:54.347 --> 00:12:56.112
history.
Interestingly,

00:12:56.112 --> 00:12:59.339
many of the books in this
section of the Bible explore

00:12:59.339 --> 00:13:03.314
questions of suffering and evil,
and challenge some of the ideas

00:13:03.314 --> 00:13:06.527
that we've seen as more
fundamental in the Torah and in

00:13:06.527 --> 00:13:09.264
the Prophets.
They explore the very questions

00:13:09.264 --> 00:13:12.200
that are raised by the events of
Israel's history,

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.727
and so they were appropriated
by the community in its quest

00:13:15.727 --> 00:13:18.159
for meaning in the midst of
suffering.

00:13:18.159 --> 00:13:21.730
Let's turn to the Book of
Ecclesiastes or Qohelet.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.639
The Hebrew name is Qohelet,
Ecclesiastes.

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:29.659
It's a second attack on the
optimism and piety of

00:13:29.659 --> 00:13:32.169
conventional religion.
 

00:13:32.169 --> 00:13:35.269
The book is mostly in the first
person.

00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:37.506
There's a third-person
introduction and a little

00:13:37.506 --> 00:13:40.265
epilogue.
The introduction reads "The

00:13:40.265 --> 00:13:42.748
words of Qohelet,
Son of David,

00:13:42.748 --> 00:13:44.570
King in Jerusalem."
 

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.316
Now, Qohelet may mean preacher
and that's why the Greek

00:13:47.316 --> 00:13:50.561
translation Ecclesiastes,
which means preacher (it's hard

00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:53.519
to know): "one who assembles or
gathers others."

00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:56.695
But tradition attributes the
work to David's son Solomon,

00:13:56.695 --> 00:13:58.000
known for his wisdom.
 

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.899
This attribution is fictive.
 

00:13:59.899 --> 00:14:03.200
The writer speaks of kings
reigning before him.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.590
That implies there were many.
 

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.605
But more important there are
linguistic and literary features

00:14:08.605 --> 00:14:11.349
that suggest a later,
probably or perhaps,

00:14:11.349 --> 00:14:13.090
a fourth-century date.
 

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.998
So, as such,
the work can be understood as a

00:14:15.998 --> 00:14:18.840
post-destruction and a
post-exilic work.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.879
It was available to Israelites
who were struggling to make

00:14:21.879 --> 00:14:23.960
sense of their history and their
God,

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.629
even though no reference is
made to that history at all.

00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:31.077
In fact, God is not referred to
by his personal Israelite name

00:14:31.077 --> 00:14:34.899
Yahweh in the book at all;
he's only referred to with the

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:39.378
general term Elohim. The
prominent tone of the book is

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:43.260
one of alienated cynicism and a
weary melancholy;

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.019
it's the prominent tone.
 

00:14:45.019 --> 00:14:48.483
The theme that's repeated
throughout is the idea of the

00:14:48.483 --> 00:14:50.279
emptiness of human effort.
 

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:52.745
All is vanity,
which means futile,

00:14:52.745 --> 00:14:54.389
it's all for naught.
 

00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:57.410
Qohelet 1:1:
"Utter futility!--said

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.719
Kohelet--/ Utter futility!
 

00:14:59.719 --> 00:15:02.978
all is futile!
/ What real value is there for

00:15:02.978 --> 00:15:05.950
a man / In all the gains he
makes beneath the sun?

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:07.934
/ One generation goes,
another comes,

00:15:07.934 --> 00:15:10.360
/ But the earth remains the
same forever."

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.960
and in verse 9,
"Only that shall happen / Which

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.335
has happened,
/ Only that occur / Which has

00:15:15.335 --> 00:15:17.601
occurred;
/ There is nothing new /

00:15:17.601 --> 00:15:18.750
Beneath the sun!"
 

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.299
The endless repeated cycles of
the natural world,

00:15:21.299 --> 00:15:23.690
the rising and setting of the
sun and moon,

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:27.663
the ebb and flow of the
tides--this leads the speaker to

00:15:27.663 --> 00:15:30.769
the conclusion that nothing is
permanent.

00:15:30.769 --> 00:15:33.470
All is fleeting,
change constantly.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:37.514
We don't find in Qohelet the
linear view of time or the sense

00:15:37.514 --> 00:15:41.153
of progress in history that
scholars rightly or wrongly

00:15:41.153 --> 00:15:43.580
associate with the Hebrew Bible.
 

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:47.296
We find here instead the cyclic
view of time which scholars,

00:15:47.296 --> 00:15:50.320
again rightly or wrongly,
associate with myth.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.122
There are also the endlessly
repeated cycles of the human

00:15:54.122 --> 00:15:57.906
world: birth and death,
breaking down and building up,

00:15:57.906 --> 00:16:00.340
weeping and laughter,
love and hate,

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.940
killing and healing.
 

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.135
In one of the most famous
passages from this book,

00:16:05.135 --> 00:16:08.983
Qohelet expresses the idea that
everything has its season or

00:16:08.983 --> 00:16:13.026
time with the consequence that
the effort of humans to alter or

00:16:13.026 --> 00:16:15.440
affect anything is meaningless.
 

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.544
I'm going to be reading from
the RSV translation,

00:16:17.544 --> 00:16:19.210
and in fact,
many of the things I'll be

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:20.919
reading today will be from the
RSV,

00:16:20.919 --> 00:16:23.480
Revised Standard Version,
because I think many of these

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.139
passages will be familiar to
you,

00:16:25.139 --> 00:16:28.145
and I'd rather read versions
that will catch your ears as

00:16:28.145 --> 00:16:31.258
familiar, than the more accurate
translations of the Jewish

00:16:31.258 --> 00:16:35.121
Publications Society,
but which may not ring that

00:16:35.121 --> 00:16:37.270
familiar note for you.
 

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.240
So this is the RSV translation.
 

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.850
But notice how in context it
has a very different meaning

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.600
from the meaning that's been
granted it by folk singers:

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.637
For everything there is a
season, and a time for every

00:16:47.637 --> 00:16:49.781
matter under heaven:
a time to be born,

00:16:49.781 --> 00:16:51.847
and a time to die;
a time to plant,

00:16:51.847 --> 00:16:54.340
and a time to pluck up what is
planted;

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.259
a time to kill,
and a time to heal;

00:16:56.259 --> 00:16:58.769
a time to break down,
and a time to build up;

00:16:58.769 --> 00:17:00.899
a time to weep,
and a time to laugh;

00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:03.090
a time to mourn,
and a time to dance;

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.421
a time to cast away stones,
and a time to gather stones

00:17:06.421 --> 00:17:08.215
together;
a time to embrace,

00:17:08.215 --> 00:17:10.569
and a time to refrain from
embracing;

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:12.869
a time to seek,
and a time to lose;

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:15.619
a time to keep,
and a time to cast away;

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:18.369
a time to rend,
and a time to sow;

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:21.049
a time to keep silence,
and a time to speak;

00:17:21.049 --> 00:17:23.279
a time to love,
and a time to hate;

00:17:23.279 --> 00:17:26.319
a time for war,
and a time for peace.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.955
Switching now to the JPS
translation, "What value,

00:17:28.955 --> 00:17:31.859
then, can the man of affairs
get from what he earns?

00:17:31.859 --> 00:17:34.717
I have observed the business
that God gave man to be

00:17:34.717 --> 00:17:37.127
concerned with:
He brings everything to pass

00:17:37.127 --> 00:17:39.463
precisely at its time;"
In other words,

00:17:39.463 --> 00:17:42.428
everything comes to pass and
returns in endless cycles,

00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:44.240
we add nothing by our efforts.
 

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:49.188
It's not quite the comforting
passage that it's often quoted

00:17:49.188 --> 00:17:51.200
to be.
So the writer has tried

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.580
everything in his search for
something that's permanent and

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.742
not evanescent.
Physical pleasure,

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.350
he says, is unsatisfying.
 

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.619
It's transient.
Wealth just brings anxiety.

00:18:01.619 --> 00:18:06.170
Wisdom is better than power,
but even knowledge brings great

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:07.575
pain.
1:17 and 18:

00:18:07.575 --> 00:18:11.544
"And so I set my mind to
appraise wisdom and to appraise

00:18:11.544 --> 00:18:13.059
madness and folly.
 

00:18:13.059 --> 00:18:16.383
And I learned--that this,
too, was pursuit of wind:

00:18:16.383 --> 00:18:18.910
For as wisdom grows,
vexation grows;

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.711
/ To increase learning is to
increase heartache" (Don't

00:18:22.711 --> 00:18:26.794
believe him!) Even if we concede
that wisdom is superior to

00:18:26.794 --> 00:18:29.418
ignorance,
we must still face the fact

00:18:29.418 --> 00:18:32.210
that ultimately death
obliterates everything.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:34.280
Death is the great equalizer.
 

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:38.150
Qohelet 2:13-17:
I found that

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.067
Wisdom is superior to folly
As light is superior to

00:18:41.067 --> 00:18:43.664
darkness;
A wise man has his eyes in his

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:45.753
head,
Whereas a fool walks in

00:18:45.753 --> 00:18:48.436
darkness.
But I also realize that the

00:18:48.436 --> 00:18:50.019
same fate awaits them both.
 

00:18:50.019 --> 00:18:53.071
So I reflected:
"The fate of the fool is also

00:18:53.071 --> 00:18:55.420
destined for me;
to what advantage,

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.950
then, have I been wise?"
 

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:59.768
And I came to the conclusion
that that too was futile,

00:18:59.768 --> 00:19:01.894
because the wise man,
just like the fool,

00:19:01.894 --> 00:19:05.225
is not remembered forever;
for, as the succeeding days

00:19:05.225 --> 00:19:07.089
roll by, both are forgotten.
 

00:19:07.089 --> 00:19:10.319
Alas, the wise man dies,
just like the fool!

00:19:10.319 --> 00:19:13.776
And so I loathed life,
For I was distressed by all

00:19:13.776 --> 00:19:17.656
that goes on under the sun,
because everything is futile

00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:19.349
and pursuit of wind.
 

00:19:19.349 --> 00:19:23.734
So even more explicitly then
Job, Ecclesiastes attacks the

00:19:23.734 --> 00:19:28.119
principle of divine providence
or distributive justice.

00:19:28.119 --> 00:19:31.279
There's no principle of reward
or punishment;

00:19:31.279 --> 00:19:34.190
the wicked prosper while the
innocent suffer.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:37.400
Even the principle of delayed
punishment which is so important

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.400
to the Deuteronomistic historian
is attacked as unjust.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.622
In Qohelet 8:10b to 14,
And here's another

00:19:44.622 --> 00:19:48.010
frustration: the fact that the
sentence imposed for evil deeds

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:51.038
is not executed swiftly,
which is why men are emboldened

00:19:51.038 --> 00:19:53.750
to do evil--the fact that a
sinner may do evil a hundred

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.461
times and his [punishment]
still be delayed… sometimes

00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:59.271
an upright man is requited
according to the conduct of the

00:19:59.271 --> 00:20:01.283
scoundrel;
and sometimes the scoundrel is

00:20:01.283 --> 00:20:03.240
requited according to the
conduct of the upright.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.609
I say all that is
frustration.

00:20:05.609 --> 00:20:09.750
In a more famous passage,
chapter 9:11-12,

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.369
I have further observed
under the sun that

00:20:11.369 --> 00:20:13.260
The race is not won by the
swift,

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.060
Nor the battle by the valiant;
Nor is bread won by the wise,

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:20.170
Nor wealth by the intelligent,
Nor favor by the learned.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.440
For the time of mischance comes
to all.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.609
And a man cannot even know his
time.

00:20:24.609 --> 00:20:28.066
Again, a passage which is often
used as a comforting

00:20:28.066 --> 00:20:32.337
exhortation--the race is not won
by the swift and so on--is here

00:20:32.337 --> 00:20:36.472
actually in context a lament of
the great injustice of the way

00:20:36.472 --> 00:20:39.619
things occur.
But really for Qohelet it is

00:20:39.619 --> 00:20:43.073
the inexorable fact of death
that makes life entirely

00:20:43.073 --> 00:20:45.169
meaningless,
and that is in fact the

00:20:45.169 --> 00:20:48.180
starting point of modern schools
of existentialist philosophy.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.336
Death is the bottom line;
he rejects the idea of any life

00:20:51.336 --> 00:20:54.940
after death.
Chapter 9:2-6:

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.192
"For the same fate is in
store for all:

00:20:57.192 --> 00:20:59.240
for the righteous,
and for the wicked;

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.829
for the good and pure,
and for the impure;

00:21:00.829 --> 00:21:03.259
for him who sacrifices,
and for him who does not;

00:21:03.259 --> 00:21:05.920
for him who is pleasing,
and for him who is displeasing;

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.799
and for him who swears,
and for him who shuns oaths.

00:21:08.799 --> 00:21:12.309
That is the sad thing about all
that goes on under the sun:

00:21:12.309 --> 00:21:14.789
that the same fate is in store
for all.

00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:17.682
…For he who is reckoned among
the living has something to look

00:21:17.682 --> 00:21:20.069
forward to…since the living
know they will die."

00:21:20.069 --> 00:21:22.789
[That was ironic.]
"But the dead know nothing;

00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:26.246
they have no more recompense,
for even the memory of them has

00:21:26.246 --> 00:21:27.205
died.
Their loves,

00:21:27.205 --> 00:21:28.966
their hates,
their jealousies have long

00:21:28.966 --> 00:21:31.366
since perished;
and they have no more share

00:21:31.366 --> 00:21:34.267
till the end of time and all
that goes on under the

00:21:34.267 --> 00:21:36.177
sun."
Nevertheless,

00:21:36.177 --> 00:21:41.245
despite all of this despair and
cynicism, there is a positive

00:21:41.245 --> 00:21:44.195
note in Qohelet.
The writer, after all,

00:21:44.195 --> 00:21:47.680
doesn't recommend nihilism or
suicide, despite the lack of

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.104
purpose or meaning in life,
and in fact he does quite the

00:21:51.104 --> 00:21:54.168
opposite.
He states that every life does

00:21:54.168 --> 00:21:58.660
have its moments of happiness
and these one should seize while

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:02.079
one can.
Qohelet 9:7-10,

00:22:02.079 --> 00:22:05.456
Go, eat your bread in
gladness, and drink your wine in

00:22:05.456 --> 00:22:07.430
joy;
for your action was long ago

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:10.031
approved by God.
Let your clothes always be

00:22:10.031 --> 00:22:13.130
freshly washed and your head
never lack ointment.

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:15.966
Enjoy happiness with a woman
you love all the fleeting days

00:22:15.966 --> 00:22:18.899
of life that have been granted
to you under the sun--all your

00:22:18.899 --> 00:22:21.573
fleeting days.
For that alone is what you can

00:22:21.573 --> 00:22:25.400
get out of life and out of the
means you acquire under the sun.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.230
Whatever it is in your power to
do, do with all your might.

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.178
For there is no action,
no reasoning,

00:22:31.178 --> 00:22:33.235
no learning,
no wisdom in Sheol,

00:22:33.235 --> 00:22:36.469
where you are going.
Again, Sheol refers to this

00:22:36.469 --> 00:22:39.926
shadowy place beneath the soil,
that the shades of the dead

00:22:39.926 --> 00:22:42.243
just inhabit.
It's an ancient notion in

00:22:42.243 --> 00:22:44.248
Israel.
It's not connected with the

00:22:44.248 --> 00:22:46.920
idea of a reward or a punishment
after death.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.375
A similar exhortation is in
Qohelet 5:17,

00:22:49.375 --> 00:22:53.120
"Behold, what I have seen to be
good and fitting is to eat and

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.804
drink and find enjoyment in all
the toil with which one toils

00:22:56.804 --> 00:23:00.303
under the sun the few days of
his life which God has given

00:23:00.303 --> 00:23:02.920
him,
for this is his lot,".

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.890
Or 3:13: "…whenever a man
does eat and drink and get

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:09.029
enjoyment out of all his wealth,
it is a gift of God."

00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:11.980
We have to be sure not to
delude ourselves.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.770
There is no grand plan,
there's no absolute value or

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.740
meaning to our toil,
Qohelet says.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.432
There's no life in the
hereafter that we are working

00:23:19.432 --> 00:23:21.033
towards.
Here he seems to be

00:23:21.033 --> 00:23:23.349
polemicizing,
I think, against a belief in

00:23:23.349 --> 00:23:25.517
the afterlife,
or reward or punishment,

00:23:25.517 --> 00:23:28.535
that was taking root at this
time in some parts of the Jewish

00:23:28.535 --> 00:23:31.049
community under the influence of
Greek thought.

00:23:31.049 --> 00:23:33.904
But one can still find
happiness and love,

00:23:33.904 --> 00:23:36.690
and with these,
one should be content.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:40.458
Striving after anything more is
a striving after wind that

00:23:40.458 --> 00:23:43.500
leaves one frustrated and weary,
and bitter.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.990
Accept the reality of death and
then enjoy what you can in the

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:48.250
short time you have.
 

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.687
Indeed, it's precisely the
reality of death that makes life

00:23:51.687 --> 00:23:54.052
precious.
Whatever it is in your power to

00:23:54.052 --> 00:23:57.146
do, do with all your might
because you have only this one

00:23:57.146 --> 00:23:59.824
brief chance.
Eternal, unlimited life with

00:23:59.824 --> 00:24:03.028
endless opportunities to act
would make any one act

00:24:03.028 --> 00:24:05.734
meaningless.
So given the fact of death and

00:24:05.734 --> 00:24:09.281
the limitations that it places
upon us, taking pleasure in the

00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:12.886
ordinary activities and labors
of life becomes not meaningless,

00:24:12.886 --> 00:24:15.613
but meaningful.
Qohelet is an unusual,

00:24:15.613 --> 00:24:19.379
if not subversive book,
and its inclusion in the canon

00:24:19.379 --> 00:24:22.720
was apparently a matter of some
controversy.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.858
Its controversial character is
reflected in the pious editorial

00:24:26.858 --> 00:24:30.130
postscript that appears at the
end of the book.

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:33.437
At the very end,
chapter 12, verses 11-13 we

00:24:33.437 --> 00:24:36.933
read the following,
The sayings of the wise

00:24:36.933 --> 00:24:39.608
are like goads,
like nails fixed in prodding

00:24:39.608 --> 00:24:42.109
sticks.
They were given by one Shepherd.

00:24:42.109 --> 00:24:43.894
A further word:
Against them,

00:24:43.894 --> 00:24:45.170
my son, be warned!
 

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:48.112
The making of many books is
without limit / And much study

00:24:48.112 --> 00:24:49.609
is a wearying of the flesh.
 

00:24:49.609 --> 00:24:52.303
The sum of the matter,
when all is said and done:

00:24:52.303 --> 00:24:54.660
Revere God and observe His
commandments!

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.544
For this applies to all
mankind: that God will call

00:24:57.544 --> 00:25:00.314
every creature to account for
everything unknown,

00:25:00.314 --> 00:25:03.212
be it good or bad.
To fear God and obey his

00:25:03.212 --> 00:25:06.311
commandments because he will
reward the good and punish the

00:25:06.311 --> 00:25:09.570
evil is simply not the message
of the Book of Qohelet and it's

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:13.045
very likely (in my view;
people will disagree) but it's

00:25:13.045 --> 00:25:16.253
very likely that this line comes
from a later hand,

00:25:16.253 --> 00:25:20.039
which was disturbed by the
theme of Qohelet's preaching.

00:25:20.039 --> 00:25:24.007
So we have juxtaposed then two
responses to the suffering and

00:25:24.007 --> 00:25:27.049
pain in the world,
and specifically the tragedy

00:25:27.049 --> 00:25:28.569
that befell Israel.
 

00:25:28.569 --> 00:25:31.319
One, an assertion of God's
providence and justice,

00:25:31.319 --> 00:25:33.901
urging obedience,
and the other an assertion of

00:25:33.901 --> 00:25:36.819
the lack of justice and
providence in the world,

00:25:36.819 --> 00:25:39.646
preaching simple existential
pleasures as a source of life's

00:25:39.646 --> 00:25:42.665
meaning, and the frustration of
trying to make sense out of what

00:25:42.665 --> 00:25:45.390
has happened.
The richness of the Hebrew

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:50.020
Bible derives precisely from its
placement together of radically

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.740
diverse points of view like
these.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.074
I'm going to turn now to the
Book of Psalms,

00:25:55.074 --> 00:25:57.680
which we will probably not
quite finish today.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:02.156
But the Book of Psalms contains
the principle collection of

00:26:02.156 --> 00:26:05.089
religious lyric poetry in the
Bible.

00:26:05.089 --> 00:26:10.010
It consists of 150 poems,
most of which are prayers

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:11.880
addressed to God.
 

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.570
In a very nice little essay on
the Psalms, there's a woman,

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:18.390
Margaret Anne Doody,
who recounts a wonderful

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.526
dialogue that takes place in
Charlotte Bronte's novel,

00:26:21.526 --> 00:26:22.710
Jane Eyre.
 

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:25.285
You have the ten-year-old
Jane--she's a very honest,

00:26:25.285 --> 00:26:27.861
but mistreated child,
and she's being interviewed by

00:26:27.861 --> 00:26:30.204
Brocklehurst,
who is this very harsh

00:26:30.204 --> 00:26:32.533
schoolmaster.
And Jane recounts the

00:26:32.533 --> 00:26:35.670
conversation like this:
"Do you read your Bible?"

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.052
"Sometimes."
"With pleasure?

00:26:38.052 --> 00:26:39.609
Are you fond of it?"
 

00:26:39.609 --> 00:26:41.995
"I like Revelation,
and the Book of Daniel,

00:26:41.995 --> 00:26:44.950
and Genesis and Samuel and a
little bit of Exodus,

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:47.950
and some parts of Kings and
Chronicles, and Job,

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:49.883
and Jonah."
"And the Psalms?

00:26:49.883 --> 00:26:51.470
I hope you like them?"
 

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:54.769
"No, sir."
"No? Oh, shocking!

00:26:54.769 --> 00:26:56.571
I have a little boy,
younger than you,

00:26:56.571 --> 00:26:59.536
who knows six Psalms by heart;
and when you ask him which he

00:26:59.536 --> 00:27:01.622
would rather have,
a gingerbread-nut to eat,

00:27:01.622 --> 00:27:03.708
or a verse of a Psalm to learn
he says: 'Oh!

00:27:03.708 --> 00:27:04.970
the verse of a Psalm!
 

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:08.285
Angels sing psalms,' says he;
'I wish to be a little angel

00:27:08.285 --> 00:27:11.307
here below';
he then gets two nuts in

00:27:11.307 --> 00:27:14.619
recompense for his infant
piety."

00:27:14.619 --> 00:27:16.809
"Psalms are not interesting," I
remarked.

00:27:16.809 --> 00:27:19.990
"That proves you have a wicked
heart." [Doody 1994]

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:23.452
Margaret Anne Doody has pointed
out I think several interesting

00:27:23.452 --> 00:27:24.960
aspects to this dialogue.
 

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.826
First, she points out the
literary authority and

00:27:27.826 --> 00:27:30.509
individual taste that's
exhibited by Jane.

00:27:30.509 --> 00:27:34.509
She likes prophetic books with
dramatic apocalyptic imagery.

00:27:34.509 --> 00:27:37.562
She likes Revelation and Daniel
which we'll see soon is very

00:27:37.562 --> 00:27:40.315
dramatic and apocalyptic;
and then she likes rich,

00:27:40.315 --> 00:27:42.462
narrative texts and
histories--Genesis,

00:27:42.462 --> 00:27:45.908
Samuel, parts of Exodus (I can
probably pick out which parts!)

00:27:45.908 --> 00:27:48.545
Kings,
Chronicles and then she likes

00:27:48.545 --> 00:27:52.577
the stories of the trials of
great survivors of tribulation

00:27:52.577 --> 00:27:55.079
like Jane herself--Job and
Jonah.

00:27:55.079 --> 00:27:58.153
Brocklehurst is looking for
evidence of her piety and

00:27:58.153 --> 00:28:01.758
instead he finds evidence of her
distasteful love of drama and

00:28:01.758 --> 00:28:03.634
story,
and imagery and suffering,

00:28:03.634 --> 00:28:04.819
and he's quite shocked.
 

00:28:04.819 --> 00:28:08.310
A pious child would naturally
love the Psalms which in

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:11.339
Brocklehurst's mind are the
songs of angels;

00:28:11.339 --> 00:28:14.160
they teach humility and
reverence and his own pious

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.360
child knows how to recite the
Psalms.

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.650
Jane's not impressed.
 

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:21.077
She obviously sees through the
son's little game even if

00:28:21.077 --> 00:28:24.006
Brocklehurst doesn't,
and she says Psalms aren't

00:28:24.006 --> 00:28:26.250
interesting, and he's mortified.
 

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:30.328
Jane's lack of interest in the
Psalms, her preference for what

00:28:30.328 --> 00:28:33.537
Doody calls the raw and the
real, is proof of her

00:28:33.537 --> 00:28:36.353
wickedness.
But Brocklehurst's perception

00:28:36.353 --> 00:28:39.293
of the Book of Psalms,
which I think many people

00:28:39.293 --> 00:28:41.920
share, is not an entirely
accurate one.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.236
If Jane were to look closely
she would find plenty of emotion

00:28:45.236 --> 00:28:47.890
and drama and suffering in the
Psalms as well.

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:51.589
The title Psalms derives from
the Greek, psalmoi.

00:28:51.589 --> 00:28:55.099
It denotes religious songs that
are performed to musical

00:28:55.099 --> 00:28:57.386
accompaniment;
the musical accompaniment of

00:28:57.386 --> 00:28:59.488
the psalterion.
That's a stringed musical

00:28:59.488 --> 00:29:01.586
instrument.
So they imagined that these

00:29:01.586 --> 00:29:03.502
were performed to this
accompaniment,

00:29:03.502 --> 00:29:04.779
hence psalmoi.
 

00:29:04.779 --> 00:29:07.542
And it's the Septuagint's
translation of the Hebrew title

00:29:07.542 --> 00:29:09.998
tehilllim;
the Hebrew title

00:29:09.998 --> 00:29:13.130
tehillim means "praises."
 

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:17.835
The Psalms were only collected
into a large anthology in the

00:29:17.835 --> 00:29:19.509
post-exilic period.
 

00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:22.420
We can be pretty sure of
that--the fifth or the fourth

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.728
century.
But many, many--particularly

00:29:24.728 --> 00:29:28.183
those that are attributed to
professional temple musical

00:29:28.183 --> 00:29:32.140
guilds--are thought to have been
used in the temple service.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:35.789
Many of them date from very
early pre-exilic times.

00:29:35.789 --> 00:29:39.527
The temple staff provided the
Psalms with musical and

00:29:39.527 --> 00:29:41.180
liturgical notations.
 

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:44.084
I don't mean musical notes but
I mean words indicating some

00:29:44.084 --> 00:29:47.138
sort of musical or liturgical
use, and those are preserved for

00:29:47.138 --> 00:29:49.470
us in the text.
We don't, for the most part,

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:50.850
really know what they mean.
 

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:52.230
They're technical.
 

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:56.345
Some superscriptions and notes
seem to be telling us the tune

00:29:56.345 --> 00:29:59.980
or the kind of musical
accompaniment for the Psalm,

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.839
whether it was on stringed
instruments, or flutes.

00:30:02.839 --> 00:30:05.824
Most of the Psalms really tell
us very little,

00:30:05.824 --> 00:30:09.008
however, about the time and
circumstance of their

00:30:09.008 --> 00:30:11.507
composition.
Several, it seems,

00:30:11.507 --> 00:30:15.660
were to be used at royal
coronations which would mean

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:20.052
that they were written when
Davidic kings still ruled in

00:30:20.052 --> 00:30:23.125
Jerusalem.
Psalm 45 is an example of a

00:30:23.125 --> 00:30:26.737
love song that's written in
celebration of the king's

00:30:26.737 --> 00:30:30.765
marriage with a foreign bride,
so this is also a pre-exilic

00:30:30.765 --> 00:30:34.529
date.
So Psalm 45:11-18;

00:30:34.529 --> 00:30:37.329
this would have been sung
probably at a royal wedding:

00:30:37.329 --> 00:30:39.330
"Take heed,
lass, and note,

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.024
incline your ear:
forget your people and your

00:30:42.024 --> 00:30:44.472
father's house,
and let the king be aroused by

00:30:44.472 --> 00:30:46.457
your beauty;
since he is your lord,

00:30:46.457 --> 00:30:49.395
bow to him.
O Tyrian lass," [so she's from

00:30:49.395 --> 00:30:52.119
Tyre to the north],
"the wealthiest people will

00:30:52.119 --> 00:30:54.560
court your favor with gifts,
goods of all sorts.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.257
The royal princess,
her dress embroidered with

00:30:57.257 --> 00:30:59.809
golden mountings
is led inside to the king;

00:30:59.809 --> 00:31:02.230
maidens in her train,
her companions,

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:03.589
are presented to you.
 

00:31:03.589 --> 00:31:05.740
They are led in with joy and
gladness;

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.369
they enter the palace of the
king.

00:31:07.369 --> 00:31:09.700
Your sons will succeed your
ancestors;

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.220
you will appoint them princes
throughout the land.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.950
I commemorate your fame for all
generations,

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:17.619
so peoples will praise you
forever and ever.

00:31:17.619 --> 00:31:20.793
So clearly, some of the Psalms
date to the period of the

00:31:20.793 --> 00:31:23.966
monarchy, and scholars divide
the psalter into five main

00:31:23.966 --> 00:31:26.273
collections.
Each of them concludes with a

00:31:26.273 --> 00:31:29.279
little doxology that indicates
that it's the end of a section.

00:31:29.279 --> 00:31:32.699
So I've listed the sections
down here--five books within the

00:31:32.699 --> 00:31:34.090
larger book of Psalms.
 

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:37.180
 
 

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:40.731
The latest of these--they
probably go somewhat in

00:31:40.731 --> 00:31:42.359
chronological order.
 

00:31:42.359 --> 00:31:44.665
So we think number five,
for example,

00:31:44.665 --> 00:31:48.571
is probably the latest of the
group because it's the one where

00:31:48.571 --> 00:31:52.285
the manuscripts that were found
at Qumran show the greatest

00:31:52.285 --> 00:31:54.905
variation,
which suggests that they

00:31:54.905 --> 00:31:58.759
continued fluid for some time
before being finally fixed.

00:31:58.759 --> 00:32:01.006
The second book,
Book Two (so about halfway

00:32:01.006 --> 00:32:04.334
through the Psalms;
the end of number 72)--Book Two

00:32:04.334 --> 00:32:08.104
concludes with this postscript:
"The prayers of David,

00:32:08.104 --> 00:32:10.380
the Son of Jesse,
are ended."

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:14.782
So at one time the Davidic
Psalms were thought to end

00:32:14.782 --> 00:32:17.623
there.
Almost all of the Psalms in

00:32:17.623 --> 00:32:21.388
Book One are prefaced with the
phrase to, or of,

00:32:21.388 --> 00:32:25.430
David.
The particle in Hebrew can be

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:28.140
ambiguous;
probably "of David."

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.778
To this old First Temple
nucleus, you had other

00:32:31.778 --> 00:32:34.230
collections then gravitating.
 

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:37.280
So, for example,
all of the Psalms between 120

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:41.279
and 134, they all bear the same
title: A Song of Ascents.

00:32:41.279 --> 00:32:43.739
They were songs that were
probably sung by pilgrims on

00:32:43.739 --> 00:32:46.570
pilgrimage to Jerusalem because
from any direction you go into

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:48.656
Jerusalem,
you have to go up,

00:32:48.656 --> 00:32:51.130
and so you go up to Jerusalem.
 

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:54.174
Nevertheless,
tradition attributes the entire

00:32:54.174 --> 00:32:58.532
book of Psalms to King David and
that attribution stems from the

00:32:58.532 --> 00:33:02.822
fact that 73 of the 150 Psalms
are explicitly said to be psalms

00:33:02.822 --> 00:33:05.658
of David.
And David is also in the

00:33:05.658 --> 00:33:09.630
historical books said to be a
man of musical talent.

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:14.228
The superscriptions,
however, are in many cases late

00:33:14.228 --> 00:33:17.583
additions.
So perhaps the Psalms can only

00:33:17.583 --> 00:33:21.827
be said to be of David or
Davidic if by that term we mean

00:33:21.827 --> 00:33:26.450
that they are the result of a
royal patronage of poetry by the

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:28.799
House of David in general.
 

00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:32.207
The biblical text itself lists
other authors for some of the

00:33:32.207 --> 00:33:34.460
Psalms, so 72 is ascribed to
Solomon.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.537
Number 90 is ascribed to Moses,
others are ascribed to Assaf

00:33:37.537 --> 00:33:38.789
and the Sons of Korah.
 

00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:41.130
Korah is an ancestor of a
priestly family.

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:43.450
Some of them are clearly
post-exilic.

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:46.710
Number 74 laments the
destruction of the temple.

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:49.572
Number 137--"By the rivers of
Babylon, there we sat,

00:33:49.572 --> 00:33:52.602
sat and wept as we thought of
Zion" is clearly from the

00:33:52.602 --> 00:33:54.230
perspective of the exile.
 

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:57.085
So what we have is an
anthology, an anthology of

00:33:57.085 --> 00:34:00.790
religious expressions deriving
from many centuries of Israel's

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:02.938
history.
So despite the claim of

00:34:02.938 --> 00:34:06.391
religious tradition that the
Psalms were penned by David,

00:34:06.391 --> 00:34:09.659
it's clear that they were not
all penned by David.

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:13.190
Some of the Psalms are oriented
toward community worship.

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:16.380
Some of them are oriented more
to individual worship.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:19.298
But in ancient Israel there
really isn't always a sharp

00:34:19.298 --> 00:34:20.920
distinction between the two.
 

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:25.011
The ancient Israelite in the
temple prayed to God as a member

00:34:25.011 --> 00:34:28.967
of a larger community bound by a
covenant and not as a lone

00:34:28.967 --> 00:34:32.213
individual.
So in the words of Psalm 34:3

00:34:32.213 --> 00:34:36.353
we read, "Exalt the Lord with
me, let us extol His name

00:34:36.353 --> 00:34:39.424
together."
So there was a communal aspect

00:34:39.424 --> 00:34:42.496
to much worship.
A good deal of form critical

00:34:42.496 --> 00:34:45.340
work has been done on the book
of Psalms.

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.500
We haven't spent a lot of time
on form criticism.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.635
It's another tool,
another approach that is used

00:34:49.635 --> 00:34:50.679
in studying the text.
 

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:54.166
But the pioneer in this area
was a man named Herman Gunkel (I

00:34:54.166 --> 00:34:56.199
think I've mentioned him
before).

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:59.573
His work, particularly in the
book of Psalms,

00:34:59.573 --> 00:35:02.409
was forwarded by Sigmund
Mowinckel.

00:35:02.409 --> 00:35:05.514
Form critics look at the forms
that are used in the

00:35:05.514 --> 00:35:08.432
construction of psalms,
and they classify psalms

00:35:08.432 --> 00:35:11.412
according to their forms or
their literary genre,

00:35:11.412 --> 00:35:14.310
if you will.
And then they attempt to place

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:17.753
these literary types or genres
within the cultic setting or

00:35:17.753 --> 00:35:20.781
their Sitz im Leben:
what would have been the

00:35:20.781 --> 00:35:24.580
circumstances under which such a
psalm would have been written or

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:27.750
performed.
In general, the psalms can be

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:31.551
categorized formally and
thematically in a number of

00:35:31.551 --> 00:35:35.798
different ways and I've given
you a handout which presents

00:35:35.798 --> 00:35:39.449
some broad classifications of
form or genre.

00:35:39.449 --> 00:35:42.543
I've actually collapsed many of
the main forms into several

00:35:42.543 --> 00:35:45.360
broader groupings,
but the very serious form

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:49.489
critics will give you upwards of
13,14, 15 or more different

00:35:49.489 --> 00:35:51.723
forms for the psalms,
and as I say,

00:35:51.723 --> 00:35:53.936
I've grouped many of them
together, as you see on the

00:35:53.936 --> 00:35:55.553
sheet.
I'm going to go through each

00:35:55.553 --> 00:35:58.241
one of these and give you some
examples and talk about some of

00:35:58.241 --> 00:36:01.150
the themes as well as the formal
characteristics in the Psalms,

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:04.347
so you'll see the variety
that's contained in this

00:36:04.347 --> 00:36:07.036
anthology.
First looking at some hymns of

00:36:07.036 --> 00:36:10.530
praise--these include creation
hymns praising God as the

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:14.025
creator of the natural world:
psalms of thanksgiving and

00:36:14.025 --> 00:36:16.733
psalms of trust.
These are really the largest

00:36:16.733 --> 00:36:19.724
category of psalms and probably
are what give Brocklehurst the

00:36:19.724 --> 00:36:21.000
impression that he has.
 

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.005
Many of them celebrate God's
majesty, God's wisdom,

00:36:24.005 --> 00:36:26.409
his power, such as this
creation hymn.

00:36:26.409 --> 00:36:29.384
This is 8 (and by the way,
the numbers are just giving you

00:36:29.384 --> 00:36:31.429
some examples.
This is not exhaustive.

00:36:31.429 --> 00:36:34.360
I didn't go through and put
every one of the 150 Psalms.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:38.040
But to give you an idea of an
example of each category I'll be

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.850
drawing from these numbers).
 

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:42.949
So number 8:
O Lord, our Lord,

00:36:42.949 --> 00:36:44.940
How majestic is Your name
throughout the earth,

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.300
You who have covered the
heavens with Your Splendor.

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.139
…When I behold Your heavens,
the work of Your fingers,

00:36:50.139 --> 00:36:52.210
the moon and stars that You set
in place,

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:55.159
what is man that You have been
mindful of him,

00:36:55.159 --> 00:36:57.340
mortal man that You have taken
note of him,

00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.349
…and adorned him with glory
and majesty;

00:36:59.349 --> 00:37:01.760
You have made him master over
Your handiwork,

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.200
laying the world at his feet,
sheep and oxen, all of them,

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.704
and wild beasts, too;
the birds of the heavens,

00:37:07.704 --> 00:37:10.380
the fish of the sea,
whatever travels the paths of

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.816
the seas.
O Lord our Lord,

00:37:11.816 --> 00:37:14.639
how majestic is Your name
throughout the earth!

00:37:14.639 --> 00:37:17.980
It's a tiny little Psalm,
Psalm 117, that's just two

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:21.974
verses long contains really all
of the classic formal elements

00:37:21.974 --> 00:37:24.659
of a Psalm of praise or
thanksgiving.

00:37:24.659 --> 00:37:28.221
You have an opening invocation
to worship, calling others to

00:37:28.221 --> 00:37:29.670
worship or praise God.
 

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:33.361
Then you have a motive clause,
which is giving the reason and

00:37:33.361 --> 00:37:36.559
then a recapitulation or a
renewed call to praise.

00:37:36.559 --> 00:37:40.602
So all of Psalm 117 follows
this form: "Praise the Lord all

00:37:40.602 --> 00:37:43.530
you nations, extol Him all you
peoples."

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:44.860
There's your invocation.
 

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.062
"For great is His steadfast
love toward us,

00:37:47.062 --> 00:37:49.579
the faithfulness of the Lord
endures forever,"

00:37:49.579 --> 00:37:52.688
there's your motive clause,
"Hallelujah," Hallelu is

00:37:52.688 --> 00:37:54.940
a Hebrew imperative "praise
Yah,"

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:56.690
short for Yahweh, God.
 

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:58.639
So Hallelujah means "praise
God."

00:37:58.639 --> 00:38:01.256
So it's a recapitulation of the
call to praise,

00:38:01.256 --> 00:38:03.019
the imperative to praise God.
 

00:38:03.019 --> 00:38:06.614
It's a classic--tiny,
little--but it has all of the

00:38:06.614 --> 00:38:10.210
elements of the form of a psalm
of thanksgiving.

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:14.710
Psalm 136 punctuates a
recitation of God's great deeds,

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:16.960
the creation,
the Exodus,

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.696
the conquest of the Promised
Land and so on with the phrase,

00:38:20.696 --> 00:38:22.849
"His steadfast love is
eternal."

00:38:22.849 --> 00:38:26.334
It's an excellent illustration
of how Israel's praise is

00:38:26.334 --> 00:38:30.010
inspired by remembering what
Yahweh has done in history.

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:33.139
Still other Psalms extol God in
His role as Creator;

00:38:33.139 --> 00:38:36.012
104 is another of those and
we've already seen one,

00:38:36.012 --> 00:38:38.713
or as law giver,
so there are various reasons to

00:38:38.713 --> 00:38:41.284
praise God: creation,
his role in history,

00:38:41.284 --> 00:38:42.590
his giving of the law.
 

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:46.848
A striking characteristic of
this category of Psalms is the

00:38:46.848 --> 00:38:50.519
variety of metaphors that are
used to describe God:

00:38:50.519 --> 00:38:53.128
King,
shield, stronghold,

00:38:53.128 --> 00:38:57.639
rock, refuge,
shelter, many more metaphors as

00:38:57.639 --> 00:39:00.940
well.
The paradigmatic psalm of trust

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.500
is contained in the 23rd Psalm.
 

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.622
This is a Psalm that employs
the metaphor of a shepherd to

00:39:06.622 --> 00:39:09.471
describe God guiding the
individual in straight paths

00:39:09.471 --> 00:39:11.280
through a frightening valley.
 

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.390
The speaker's trust creates a
sense of tranquility even in the

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:17.653
presence of enemies and here I'm
going to use the RSV translation

00:39:17.653 --> 00:39:20.050
which will be more familiar to
many of you.

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:23.039
The Lord is my Shepherd,
I shall not want;

00:39:23.039 --> 00:39:25.260
he makes me lie down in green
pastures.

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:29.500
He leads me beside still waters;
he restores my soul.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.823
He leads me in paths of
righteousness for His name's

00:39:32.823 --> 00:39:34.539
sake.
Even though I walk through the

00:39:34.539 --> 00:39:37.240
valley of the shadow of death,
I fear no evil;

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.120
for thou art with me;
thy rod and thy staff,

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.859
they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before

00:39:42.859 --> 00:39:44.699
me in the presence of my
enemies;

00:39:44.699 --> 00:39:47.920
thou anointest my head with
oil, my cup overflows.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.250
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:53.383
all the days of my life;
and I shall dwell in the House

00:39:53.383 --> 00:39:56.821
of the Lord for ever.
The short Psalm 131 is another

00:39:56.821 --> 00:40:00.878
psalm of trust that invokes the
image of a mother and a child to

00:40:00.878 --> 00:40:03.389
express an even greater
tranquility.

00:40:03.389 --> 00:40:06.826
Again, the RSV translation,
"O God my heart is not lifted

00:40:06.826 --> 00:40:10.507
up, / my eyes are not raised too
high," that's a metaphor for

00:40:10.507 --> 00:40:11.980
arrogance in Hebrew.
 

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:15.297
"I do not occupy myself with
things too great and too

00:40:15.297 --> 00:40:16.510
marvelous for me.
 

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:19.781
/ But I have calmed and quieted
my soul, / like a child quieted

00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:23.099
at its mother's breast;
/ like a child that is quieted

00:40:23.099 --> 00:40:25.558
is my soul.
/ O Israel, hope in the Lord /

00:40:25.558 --> 00:40:27.769
from this time forth and for
evermore."

00:40:27.769 --> 00:40:31.404
These and similar psalms
contain some of the most

00:40:31.404 --> 00:40:36.022
personal depictions of biblical
faith, of confidence or simple

00:40:36.022 --> 00:40:39.054
trust in God.
The second category I've got

00:40:39.054 --> 00:40:42.667
listed there for you are psalms
of divine kingship or royal

00:40:42.667 --> 00:40:44.950
psalms.
These are not quite the same;

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:46.440
they're two distinct things.
 

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.752
Enthronement or kingship psalms
celebrate Yahweh as the

00:40:49.752 --> 00:40:52.328
enthroned ruler,
the sovereign ruler of the

00:40:52.328 --> 00:40:55.885
heavens and as sovereign over
foreign nations--so sovereign

00:40:55.885 --> 00:40:59.400
over nature,
sovereign over the human world.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:02.124
And their descriptions of God
employ the language and themes

00:41:02.124 --> 00:41:04.663
that are associated with deities
of Ancient Near Eastern

00:41:04.663 --> 00:41:06.463
mythology,
particularly,

00:41:06.463 --> 00:41:11.789
the language associated with
Baal, the Canaanite storm god.

00:41:11.789 --> 00:41:16.186
Some even allude to the defeat
of a sea monster as key to God's

00:41:16.186 --> 00:41:18.809
role as creator and enthroned
king.

00:41:18.809 --> 00:41:21.389
In Psalm 29,
the assembly of the gods

00:41:21.389 --> 00:41:24.900
praises Yahweh for defeating the
water monster.

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:29.147
And although some psalms fully
personify nature at the time of

00:41:29.147 --> 00:41:31.983
creation, in others,
the old Ancient Near Eastern

00:41:31.983 --> 00:41:33.940
combat creation myths are
demythologized.

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.434
So we see both of these
tendencies within some of these

00:41:36.434 --> 00:41:37.792
psalms.
So, for example,

00:41:37.792 --> 00:41:41.267
Psalm 93, "The Lord is King,
He is robed in grandeur," (most

00:41:41.267 --> 00:41:44.918
of these enthronement or divine
kingship psalms will begin with

00:41:44.918 --> 00:41:47.430
"The Lord is King"):
The Lord is King,

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:49.780
He is robed in grandeur;
the Lord is robed,

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:51.150
He is girded with strength.
 

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.349
The world stands firm;
it cannot be shaken.

00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:55.110
Your throne stands firm from of
old;

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:57.100
from eternity You have existed.
 

00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:00.390
The ocean sounds, O Lord,
the ocean sounds its thunder,

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:01.849
the ocean sounds its pounding.
 

00:42:01.849 --> 00:42:03.730
Above the thunder of the mighty
waters,

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:05.790
more majestic the than the
breakers of the sea

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:07.519
is the Lord, majestic on High.
 

00:42:07.519 --> 00:42:09.380
Your decrees are indeed
enduring;

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:12.329
holiness befits Your House,
O Lord, for all times.

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:15.263
See here, the mention of the
sea, the ocean pounding,

00:42:15.263 --> 00:42:17.349
but it's completely
demythologized.

00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:20.561
It appears here as a natural
entity and not a divine

00:42:20.561 --> 00:42:23.041
antagonist.
By contrast there are psalms in

00:42:23.041 --> 00:42:26.309
which God is battling with the
sea in the form of a monster.

00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:32.320
Royal psalms are psalms that
praise God's anointed King.

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:35.500
Some scholars believe that
these were coronation psalms.

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:38.370
These would have been used at
the time of the coronation of a

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:39.710
Davidic King,
for example.

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:43.907
So Psalm110,
"Yahweh said to my lord," my

00:42:43.907 --> 00:42:48.350
Lord now meaning the king:
"Yahweh said to my lord,

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:51.241
"Sit at My right hand
while I make your enemies your

00:42:51.241 --> 00:42:53.043
footstool."
The Lord will stretch forth

00:42:53.043 --> 00:42:56.530
from Zion your mighty scepter;
hold sway over your enemies!

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:58.938
Your people come forward
willingly on your day of

00:42:58.938 --> 00:43:00.785
battle."
[I guess that's what every king

00:43:00.785 --> 00:43:02.345
wishes for.]
"Your people come forward

00:43:02.345 --> 00:43:04.815
willingly on your day of battle
In majestic Holiness,

00:43:04.815 --> 00:43:06.623
from the womb,
from the dawn,

00:43:06.623 --> 00:43:08.530
yours was the dew of youth.
 

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:10.860
The Lord has sworn and will not
relent,

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:14.890
'You are a priest forever,
a rightful king by My decree.'

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:16.620
The Lord is at your right hand."
 

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.910
[Yahweh is at your right hand.]
"He crushes kings in the day of

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:22.580
His anger."
But not all of the royal psalms

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:25.788
were concerned primarily with
military success or guaranteeing

00:43:25.788 --> 00:43:26.840
military success.
 

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.195
Some seek to ensure that the
king, the anointed king is

00:43:30.195 --> 00:43:34.110
bestowed with other qualities
necessary for good stewardship.

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:37.364
So we find in Psalm 72,
O God,

00:43:37.364 --> 00:43:39.570
endow the king with Your
judgments,

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:41.980
the king's son with Your
righteousness;

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:44.300
that He may judge your people
rightly,

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.869
Your lowly ones, justly.
 

00:43:45.869 --> 00:43:48.270
…Let him champion the lowly
among the people,

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:51.409
deliver the needy folk,
and crush those who wrong them.

00:43:51.409 --> 00:43:54.019
Let them be like rain that
falls on a mown field,

00:43:54.019 --> 00:43:56.019
like a downpour of rain on the
ground,

00:43:56.019 --> 00:43:58.269
that the righteous may flourish
in His time,

00:43:58.269 --> 00:44:01.650
and well-being abound,
till the moon is no more.

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:04.363
A third category I've got
listed for you are psalms of

00:44:04.363 --> 00:44:06.360
lament and petition and
indebtedness,

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:09.681
and these can be voiced in the
plural (a communal supplication)

00:44:09.681 --> 00:44:11.610
or in the voice of the
individual.

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:16.496
Although individual laments may
open with an invocation to or

00:44:16.496 --> 00:44:19.668
praise of God,
some launch immediately into a

00:44:19.668 --> 00:44:23.530
desperate plea for deliverance
from some suffering or crisis.

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:25.349
It's often expressed
metaphorically.

00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:29.104
Or they might launch into a
plea for vengeance on one's

00:44:29.104 --> 00:44:31.981
enemies.
After presenting his complaint,

00:44:31.981 --> 00:44:35.639
the psalmist will usually
confess his trust in God,

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:39.579
then ask for help or
forgiveness and conclude with a

00:44:39.579 --> 00:44:42.360
vow that he will praise God
again.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.926
We sometimes even see an
acknowledgement of a divine

00:44:44.926 --> 00:44:47.090
response, perhaps a thank-you in
advance.

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:50.160
Psalm 13 has many of these
features,

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.730
How long, O Lord;
will You ignore me forever?

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:54.820
How long will You hide Your
face from me?

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:56.900
How long will I have cares on
my mind,

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.420
grief in my heart all day?
 

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:00.530
How long will my enemy have the
upper hand?

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:02.950
Look at me, answer me,
O Lord, my God!

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:06.500
Restore the luster to my eyes,
lest I sleep the sleep of death;

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:09.000
lest my enemy say,
"I have overcome him,"

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.239
my foes exult [when I totter.
 

00:45:10.239 --> 00:45:11.470
My heart will exult]
in Your deliverance.

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:14.063
I will sing to the Lord,
for He has been good to

00:45:14.063 --> 00:45:16.619
me.
Psalm 55 asks for deliverance

00:45:16.619 --> 00:45:19.510
from the treachery of a
deceitful friend:

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:21.730
It is not an enemy who
reviles me

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:24.180
-- I could bear that;
it is not my foe who vaunts

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.740
himself against me
-- I could hide from him;

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:29.910
but it is you, my equal,
my companion, my friend;

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:32.902
sweet was our fellowship;
we walked together in God's

00:45:32.902 --> 00:45:35.021
house.
Let Him incite death against

00:45:35.021 --> 00:45:36.763
them;
may they go down alive into

00:45:36.763 --> 00:45:38.440
Sheol!
For where they dwell,

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.260
there evil is.
…He harmed his ally,

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.389
he broke his pact.
 

00:45:41.389 --> 00:45:43.210
his talk was smoother then
butter,

00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:45.938
yet his mind was on war;
his words were more soothing

00:45:45.938 --> 00:45:47.940
than oil,
yet they were drawn swords.

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:51.269
Cast your burden upon the Lord
and He will sustain you;

00:45:51.269 --> 00:45:53.530
He will never let the righteous
man collapse.

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:56.010
Very personalized laments.
 

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:59.650
Some laments are pleas for
forgiveness of personal sins.

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:02.689
This one is attributed in the
psalm itself,

00:46:02.689 --> 00:46:05.150
the superscription to the
psalm;

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:08.331
it's attributed to David after
the prophet Nathan rebukes him

00:46:08.331 --> 00:46:10.769
for his illicit relationship
with Bathsheba.

00:46:10.769 --> 00:46:14.202
Listen to the striking
parallelism--you hear the poetic

00:46:14.202 --> 00:46:17.699
parallelism in this psalm,
Psalm 51, again using the RSV

00:46:17.699 --> 00:46:20.580
translation:
Have mercy on me, O God,

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:24.048
according to Thy steadfast love;
according to Thy abundant mercy

00:46:24.048 --> 00:46:25.600
blot out my transgressions.
 

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:29.310
Wash me thoroughly my iniquity,
and cleanse me from my sin!

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:32.659
For I know my transgressions,
and my sin is ever before me.

00:46:32.659 --> 00:46:34.559
Against thee,
thee only, have I sinned,

00:46:34.559 --> 00:46:36.610
and done that which is evil in
thy sight,

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:38.830
so that thou art justified in
thy sentence

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:40.260
and blameless in thy judgment.
 

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.190
…Create in me a clean heart,
O God,

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:43.949
and put a new and right spirit
within me.

00:46:43.949 --> 00:46:46.842
Cast me not away from thy
presence, and take not thy Holy

00:46:46.842 --> 00:46:49.285
spirit from me.
Restore to me the joy of thy

00:46:49.285 --> 00:46:51.433
salvation,
and uphold me with a willing

00:46:51.433 --> 00:46:53.332
spirit.
The communal laments,

00:46:53.332 --> 00:46:56.190
a lot of these are individual,
but communal laments,

00:46:56.190 --> 00:47:00.246
bewail Israel's misfortunes and
urge God's vengeance upon

00:47:00.246 --> 00:47:03.483
Israel's oppressors,
sometimes reminding God of his

00:47:03.483 --> 00:47:06.278
historic relationship with
Israel and his covenantal

00:47:06.278 --> 00:47:08.920
obligations.
Let me just finish by reading

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.739
Psalm 74 as a case in point.
 

00:47:10.739 --> 00:47:14.069
It makes explicit reference to
the destruction of the sanctuary

00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:15.679
so it's clearly post-exilic.
 

00:47:15.679 --> 00:47:18.928
And as a response to the
catastrophe, it gives expression

00:47:18.928 --> 00:47:22.061
to despair and bewilderment and
even anger that God has

00:47:22.061 --> 00:47:24.440
forgotten His obligations to
Israel:

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.059
Why, O God,
do You forever reject us,

00:47:27.059 --> 00:47:29.889
do You fume in anger at the
flock that You tend?

00:47:29.889 --> 00:47:32.110
Remember the community You made
Yours long ago,

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:33.850
Your very own tribe that You
redeemed,

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:35.440
Mount Zion, where You dwell.
 

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:39.440
Bestir Yourself because of the
perpetual tumult,

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.679
all the outrages of the enemy
in the sanctuary.

00:47:41.679 --> 00:47:44.320
Your foes roar inside Your
meeting place;

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.600
they take their signs for true
signs.

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.370
It is like men wielding axes
against a gnarled tree;

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:52.025
with hatchet and pike
they hacked away at its carved

00:47:52.025 --> 00:47:53.861
work.
They made Your sanctuary go up

00:47:53.861 --> 00:47:55.748
in flames;
they brought low in dishonor

00:47:55.748 --> 00:47:57.489
the dwelling place of Your
presence.

00:47:57.489 --> 00:47:59.267
They resolved,
"Let us destroy them

00:47:59.267 --> 00:48:01.031
altogether!"
They burned all God's

00:48:01.031 --> 00:48:02.260
tabernacles in the land.
 

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:05.599
No signs appear for us;
there is no longer any prophet;

00:48:05.599 --> 00:48:07.699
no one among us who knows for
how long.

00:48:07.699 --> 00:48:10.288
Till when, O God,
…will the enemy forever

00:48:10.288 --> 00:48:11.460
revile Your name?
 

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:13.850
Why do You hold back Your hand,
Your right hand?

00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:15.650
Draw it out of Your bosom!
 

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:17.869
…Do not deliver Your dove to
the wild beast;

00:48:17.869 --> 00:48:20.480
do not ignore forever the band
of Your lowly ones.

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.920
Look to the covenant!
 

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:24.300
…Rise, O God,
champion Your cause;

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:26.446
The psalmist is bewildered:
why has this happened,

00:48:26.446 --> 00:48:27.409
why doesn't God act?
 

00:48:27.409 --> 00:48:28.780
There's no mention of Israel's
sin;

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.559
there's no indication that the
destruction was just punishment.

00:48:31.559 --> 00:48:33.936
Psalm 44, which we'll start
with next time,

00:48:33.936 --> 00:48:37.217
goes even further and states
flatly that the people haven't

00:48:37.217 --> 00:48:39.000
sinned.
It's God who's been faithless.

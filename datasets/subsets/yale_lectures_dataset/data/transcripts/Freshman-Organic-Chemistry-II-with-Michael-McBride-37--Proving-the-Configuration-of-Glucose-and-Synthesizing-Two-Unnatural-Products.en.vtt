00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:02.500
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: OK.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.133
I realize it's reading period,
so we're supposed

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.633
to be having fun.

00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:11.267
So the structure of glucose
is really fun.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.800
I originally had this lecture
mostly about the synthesis of

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.233
two unnatural products.

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:22.967
These last two lectures were
going to be about synthesis.

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:24.833
One about unnatural
products and one

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:28.133
about natural products.

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:31.167
But glucose is such a great
story that I couldn't miss

00:00:31.167 --> 00:00:31.633
telling it.

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:34.200
So we might not get to the
synthesis of two unnatural

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.967
products, or I might just
mention it at the end.

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:39.667
It's also Nobel Prize
work, but so is the

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:41.133
structure of glucose.

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:44.133
And there are Nobel Prizes
and Nobel Prizes, but the

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.833
structure of glucose is a really
great Nobel Prize.

00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:53.033
So we saw last time that there
are carbohydrates, and I found

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:54.700
who used the word first.
It was a guy

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.833
named Schmidt in 1844.

00:00:56.833 --> 00:00:59.767
He said, "I may be allowed to
denote compounds [with] carbon

00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:03.267
plus hydrogen and oxygen in the
same ratio that obtains in

00:01:03.267 --> 00:01:06.633
water...as carbohydrates." That
is, it doesn't have to be one

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:08.800
to one, one carbon
to one water.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.800
So there were examples known.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.733
Like grape sugar was isolated
pure in 1792.

00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:19.333
And it was given by Dumas the
name glucose, which comes from

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:23.000
the Greek word gleukos,
which means sweetness.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.567
So that's where glucose
came from.

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:28.567
But even more important, the
-ose ending, which is just

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:33.167
part of the word glucose, came
to be the generic ending for

00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:34.233
all sugars.

00:01:34.233 --> 00:01:36.233
So when you see something -ose,
is means it's one of

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:38.967
these carbohydrates.

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:41.967
And we remember that Couper,
as soon as structure became

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:44.367
something that you could talk
about, because of the

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:46.700
tetravalence of carbon, he
proposed that there was

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.667
another water added to give the
hydrate of glucose, which

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:50.400
is just fine.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.267
That would still be
a carbohydrate.

00:01:52.267 --> 00:01:55.300
And he was right.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.867
So you can have aldoses like
glucose where you take two

00:02:01.867 --> 00:02:04.567
hydrogens from the top carbon,
put them on either end so you

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:05.833
have an aldehyde.

00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:08.267
Or you can do the next carbon
or the next carbon and

00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:11.200
ketones, so you can
have ketoses.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.467
For example, fructose
is a ketose, and

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:16.200
glucose is an aldose.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.833
Now, how do you know this?

00:02:18.833 --> 00:02:21.233
Of course, nowadays we know
the structure of things by

00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:22.800
spectroscopy.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.067
For example, here's
the IR spectrum of

00:02:25.067 --> 00:02:26.933
glucose, this aldehyde.

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:30.100
What do you notice specially
about this spectrum?

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.900
Anything?

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.533
What would you look for if you
were looking for a sugar?

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:37.667
You'd look for OH groups--

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:39.967
sure enough, big O-H peak.

00:02:39.967 --> 00:02:41.500
And you'd look for
what other group?

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.133
Antonia?

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:47.033
STUDENT: The aldehyde?

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.200
PROFESSOR: The
aldehyde carbonyl.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.333
And where would you look for
it, do you remember?

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:51.600
STUDENT: The C=O stretch

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.533
PROFESSOR: You look
for it around 1,700,

00:02:56.533 --> 00:02:58.833
and it's not there.

00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:02.833
Or you could do the NMR. So
here's the proton NMR of

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:03.600
crystalline glucose.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.933
You dissolve it in D2O,
so now you don't have

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:10.767
the OH protons there.

00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:12.600
And there's the proton
NMR spectrum.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.767
And again, there's no
way downfield peak.

00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:17.433
No aldehyde.

00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:20.833
Or if you look at the carbon
NMR spectrum, no downfield

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:23.800
peak for aldehyde, or
ketone, either.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.967
They would both come down there
in the carbon spectrum.

00:03:25.967 --> 00:03:28.933
Of course, there wouldn't be
a hydrogen on the ketone.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.533
So let me draw it, to try to
explain this, draw it in a

00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:37.800
funny conformation.

00:03:40.433 --> 00:03:44.000
Which could be in equilibrium
with a hemiketal.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.400
Remember?

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.633
With either acid or base
catalysis in water, here

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:52.733
deuterated water, you could make
a hemiketal down here at

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:54.833
the bottom right.

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:59.133
So all the Os are ODs,
but here you have Hs.

00:03:59.133 --> 00:04:01.833
Now let's blow up that part
of the NMR spectrum

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:05.033
that you can see there.

00:04:05.033 --> 00:04:08.233
What peak stands out?

00:04:08.233 --> 00:04:10.233
One far downfield.

00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:13.600
What's it due to?

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.567
Which of the hydrogens in this
compound should come the

00:04:16.567 --> 00:04:17.833
furthest downfield?

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.167
Leen?

00:04:25.167 --> 00:04:29.767
STUDENT: The one that's
attached to oxygen

00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:31.033
PROFESSOR: That's
attached to what?

00:04:31.033 --> 00:04:33.433
STUDENT: Attach the carbons
to O.

00:04:33.433 --> 00:04:34.267
PROFESSOR: They
all have an O.

00:04:34.267 --> 00:04:40.933
STUDENT: Well yeah, but attached
to one without the alcohol?

00:04:40.933 --> 00:04:42.500
PROFESSOR: The
one here, you mean.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.500
STUDENT: Yeah, over there.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.500
PROFESSOR: Now, that
one is on a carbon that has

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.067
two carbons attached to
it and an oxygen,

00:04:49.067 --> 00:04:52.633
and oxygens withdraw, tend to
shift things downfield.

00:04:52.633 --> 00:04:53.867
Can you do better than that?

00:04:57.067 --> 00:04:59.600
There's one oxygen to withdraw
from that carbon, right?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.067
Megan?

00:05:06.067 --> 00:05:07.800
STUDENT: The equatorial hydrogen

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.800
PROFESSOR: The
equatorial one.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.500
The one at the far right has two
oxygens pulling on it, the

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.767
one that's on a hemiketal.

00:05:15.767 --> 00:05:17.800
So it's way downfield.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.200
Now notice that there's
a little peak

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.200
here, a little doublet.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.167
What's that due to?

00:05:23.167 --> 00:05:26.933
Well, it could be just impurity,
but it's not.

00:05:26.933 --> 00:05:30.367
Because if you let it sit a day,
it grows, and the other

00:05:30.367 --> 00:05:31.600
one shrinks.

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:38.733
It's also downfield, so it
looks like it's got more

00:05:38.733 --> 00:05:39.933
oxygens on it.

00:05:39.933 --> 00:05:41.200
Anybody got an idea?

00:05:45.133 --> 00:05:47.133
What did you call
this one, Megan?

00:05:47.133 --> 00:05:48.300
STUDENT: Equatorial

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.567
PROFESSOR: Suppose
it had been axial.

00:05:52.533 --> 00:05:57.200
Then if you had a ring current,
as in benzine--

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.567
you don't here--

00:05:58.567 --> 00:06:02.300
this one would be downfield, and
the one where it was axial

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.567
would be upfield.

00:06:03.567 --> 00:06:06.367
More over the top of the ring.

00:06:06.367 --> 00:06:07.900
Can you get it there?

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.633
Yeah, you can go back here and
attack the carbonyl from the

00:06:10.633 --> 00:06:15.067
other side, and get that one.

00:06:15.067 --> 00:06:17.333
Now, how do you know
which is which?

00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:19.500
How do you know which one was
axial and which one was

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.467
equitorial?

00:06:20.467 --> 00:06:22.933
Well, you might use this
argument about ring currents.

00:06:22.933 --> 00:06:24.067
People talk about that.

00:06:24.067 --> 00:06:26.000
I'm not sure whether
it means anything.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.867
There are other kinds of
arguments you could make that

00:06:27.867 --> 00:06:29.567
might have to do
with that, too.

00:06:29.567 --> 00:06:32.633
But one thing that's clear in
the spectrum is that there's a

00:06:32.633 --> 00:06:35.500
doublet splitting here which
is about 8 Hz, and a

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.667
doublet splitting here which
isn't even half as big.

00:06:38.667 --> 00:06:42.200
So one is a big splitting, and
one is a small splitting.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.467
Now, what is it that's splitting
this hydrogen?

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.500
Karl?

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.700
STUDENT: Sometimes that D is
replaced with an H?

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.267
PROFESSOR: So there
has to be another H on the

00:06:54.267 --> 00:06:57.500
adjacent carbon that's splitting
that one, right?

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.267
So this H here.

00:06:59.267 --> 00:07:04.133
And in this case, this H
here would be doing it.

00:07:04.133 --> 00:07:06.600
But one of them is a big
splitting, and the other is a

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.700
small splitting.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.967
Sebastian, you got an idea?

00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:16.067
STUDENT: In the top
one there, anti.

00:07:16.067 --> 00:07:16.833
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:07:16.833 --> 00:07:19.933
The top one is anti, and the
other one is a gauche.

00:07:19.933 --> 00:07:23.533
So there's much better overlap,
anti than gauche.

00:07:23.533 --> 00:07:25.567
So this one is the
one that's anti.

00:07:25.567 --> 00:07:27.567
That's the one with
axial hydrogen.

00:07:27.567 --> 00:07:29.900
And this is the one that
came from the crystal.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.967
So the crystal was
all the same.

00:07:31.967 --> 00:07:35.400
You dissolve it and it begins to
equilibrate, and ultimately

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:42.567
has more of the equatorial
OD than of the axial OD.

00:07:42.567 --> 00:07:44.933
And in fact, if you look at the
original material, just

00:07:44.933 --> 00:07:48.067
after you dissolve it, it has
a rotation of 112 degrees,

00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:50.133
optically active.

00:07:50.133 --> 00:07:54.900
But after a day in D2O, it's
only 53 degrees, because the

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.800
other isomer is 19 degrees.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.133
So people used that, before
there was spectroscopy, to try

00:08:00.133 --> 00:08:04.767
to figure out what the ratio of
the two was at equilibrium.

00:08:04.767 --> 00:08:07.167
Or if you really want to do
it, you do it by X-ray

00:08:07.167 --> 00:08:10.100
diffraction, and you get
Cartesian coordinates for all

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.433
the atoms. That's what
you do nowadays.

00:08:13.433 --> 00:08:15.800
But the interesting thing,
and what got a Nobel

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.467
Prize, was not this.

00:08:17.467 --> 00:08:18.967
It was, how did they know?

00:08:18.967 --> 00:08:24.167
How could they figure out what
the structure of glucose was?

00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:27.433
Well, a lot of sugars were known
in the last half of the

00:08:27.433 --> 00:08:28.367
19th century.

00:08:28.367 --> 00:08:32.000
When van 't Hoff wrote the
German version of his book in

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.800
1877, he mentioned a lot of
sugars as optically active,

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.900
for example, here,
he cites glucose.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.733
He also cites levulose.

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:48.567
And in fact, those both
come from sucrose.

00:08:48.567 --> 00:08:51.300
So sucrose is a more
complex sugar.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.233
It's a ketale that has
two of them together.

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:58.933
But if you take them apart, one
of them is glucose and the

00:08:58.933 --> 00:09:01.633
other is levulose, which is
also called fructose.

00:09:01.633 --> 00:09:03.900
Do you know why it's
called levulose?

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.167
What does levo mean?

00:09:08.333 --> 00:09:10.767
Actually, the English word
has the same root.

00:09:10.767 --> 00:09:12.800
Left.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.900
Levo is left, dextro
is right in Latin.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.400
So this rotates white
to the left.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.200
This rotates light to the right,
and is called dextrose,

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.267
also, or dextrine down here.

00:09:27.267 --> 00:09:29.000
He also mentioned lactose.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.933
And it was found in 1876 that
lactose treated with acid

00:09:32.933 --> 00:09:37.067
gives also glucose, but another
one called galactose,

00:09:37.067 --> 00:09:39.000
which comes from the Greek
word for milk.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.500
So it's called milk
sugar in German.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.667
So lactose, obviously,
came from milk.

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:48.667
5% of milk, I think, by weight
is lactose sugar.

00:09:48.667 --> 00:09:50.133
Or there's stuff called
mannitol,

00:09:50.133 --> 00:09:52.333
which came from manna.

00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:58.067
They would slash the bark of
flowering ash trees around the

00:09:58.067 --> 00:10:00.933
Mediterranean and this stuff
would ooze out which they

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:02.100
called manna.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.667
And from that, they
got mannitol.

00:10:04.667 --> 00:10:08.667
And mannitol turns out to have
these kind of CHOH groups that

00:10:08.667 --> 00:10:10.267
van 't Hoff was interested
in because

00:10:10.267 --> 00:10:11.600
they made things chiral.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.833
But notice in mannitol, the
two ends are both OHs.

00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:20.133
The aldehyde on the end has been
reduced, in this case.

00:10:20.133 --> 00:10:26.767
Or both ends can be oxided as
in what's called sugar acid.

00:10:26.767 --> 00:10:30.100
So you could have both
ends be an acid.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:36.800
Or you can have arabinose, which
was isolated in 1873

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.900
from gum arabic.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.800
A gum that came from Arabia.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.567
You know, if you're an actor,
you put your mustache on with

00:10:43.567 --> 00:10:44.233
gum arabic.

00:10:44.233 --> 00:10:45.300
I think you used to, anyhow.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.533
I don't know.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:54.067
And in fact, it was possible to
take mannitol and oxidize

00:10:54.067 --> 00:10:55.467
it back to an aldehyde.

00:10:55.467 --> 00:10:59.233
That must have been a tough
thing to do, because aldehydes

00:10:59.233 --> 00:11:01.133
are-- very hard to
stop an aldehyde.

00:11:01.133 --> 00:11:06.133
But somehow, in 1888, they were
able to get mannose, maybe

00:11:06.133 --> 00:11:09.500
just a teeny, teeny bit
of mannose, doing that.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.000
So aldehyde.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.400
So there were lots and lots
of these known, and people

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.567
fiddled around with them, and
found out what you'd get if

00:11:16.567 --> 00:11:20.500
you oxidized, what you'd get
if you reduced, and so on.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:26.000
And on comes Heinrich Kiliani,
the hydrogen cyanide man.

00:11:28.533 --> 00:11:31.667
Because in this paper
in 1855,

00:11:31.667 --> 00:11:34.867
which, fortunately, I've
translated here,

00:11:34.867 --> 00:11:37.833
he says, "While a large number
of compounds are very easily

00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:40.500
formed upon oxidation
of dextrose"--

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.800
remember, dextrose is
glucose, it rotates

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.300
light to the right--

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.000
"by dilute nitric acid or by
halogens, these molecules

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.200
retain six carbons bound
together in a chain.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.833
Under the same conditions,
levulose"--

00:11:53.833 --> 00:11:59.733
The other one that came
from sucrose--

00:11:59.733 --> 00:12:03.167
"yields substances containing
chains with a smaller number of

00:12:03.167 --> 00:12:09.167
carbons, (like glycolic acid,
or inactive tartaric acid.)"--

00:12:09.167 --> 00:12:11.267
That's meso-tartaric acid, OK?

00:12:11.267 --> 00:12:13.467
"Here oxidation causes
immediate

00:12:13.467 --> 00:12:14.867
splitting of the molecule."--

00:12:14.867 --> 00:12:18.667
it breaks the carbon chain--," a
fact which means that levulose

00:12:18.667 --> 00:12:20.800
is a ketone."

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:26.167
So that glucose, or dextrose,
has an aldehyde at the end of

00:12:26.167 --> 00:12:28.200
the chain, you oxidize
that to an acid.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.333
But if you have a ketone in the
middle of the chain and

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:34.600
you oxidize it, you
break the chain.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.900
So it must be a ketose
of some sort.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.433
"Bearing in mind further the
fact that levulose is

00:12:39.433 --> 00:12:43.200
transformed into mannitol
by nascent hydrogen"--

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.800
nascent means at the time
it's being born.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.833
They had this interesting idea
in those days that when they

00:12:48.833 --> 00:12:55.700
dissolved sodium in alcohol,
it generated hydrogen,

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.167
but this hydrogen was more
reactive than most hydrogen,

00:12:59.167 --> 00:13:01.567
and could reduce things
that normal hydrogen

00:13:01.567 --> 00:13:02.800
gas couldn't do.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.400
So they said it was nascent
hydrogen that could do things.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.100
In fact, of course, it was the
metal actually transferring

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.433
the electrons to the compound
to be reduced.

00:13:12.433 --> 00:13:14.400
But anyhow, he said,
if you do that with

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.267
levulose, you get mannitol.

00:13:16.267 --> 00:13:18.433
Which, remember, was the
thing that has OH on

00:13:18.433 --> 00:13:20.500
both ends of the chain.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.400
So if it was a ketose, a ketone
in the middle chain, it

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.433
already had alcohols
on the end.

00:13:26.433 --> 00:13:28.767
But if you reduce the ketone
to an alcohol, then you got

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:31.867
alcohols all the way, much
like mannitol, which

00:13:31.867 --> 00:13:33.000
they got from that.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.167
So one comes to the conclusion
that levulose must be adjudged

00:13:37.167 --> 00:13:40.600
to have one of the following two
constitutional formulae.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.767
Either CO--

00:13:41.767 --> 00:13:42.933
they can't be the
first carbon.

00:13:42.933 --> 00:13:43.800
That's the aldehyde.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.867
That's the one where you reduce
it or oxidize it, it

00:13:46.867 --> 00:13:47.800
doesn't break the chain.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.633
You just get an acid there.

00:13:49.633 --> 00:13:52.467
If it's a ketone here,
you break the chain.

00:13:52.467 --> 00:13:54.667
If it's a ketone here,
you break the chain.

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:57.000
What if it's a ketone on
the next carbon down?

00:14:00.233 --> 00:14:01.567
Why didn't he consider that?

00:14:07.033 --> 00:14:07.900
Matt?

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:08.833
STUDENT: It's the same as that
one.

00:14:08.833 --> 00:14:10.233
PROFESSOR:It's the
same as the one above, right?

00:14:10.233 --> 00:14:11.700
There are only two.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.500
OK.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.300
So is it I, or is it II?

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.800
So he goes on in the paper to
say, "One could hope to

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.267
distinguish definitively between
one and the other

00:14:21.267 --> 00:14:25.967
formula by succeeding in,
adding HCN to the ketone

00:14:25.967 --> 00:14:31.233
radical of that levulose and
transforming the cyanhydrine

00:14:31.233 --> 00:14:33.767
into the corresponding
carboxylic acid."

00:14:33.767 --> 00:14:37.167
So you add CN, hydrolyze
it so it's COOH.

00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:39.033
It adds to the carbonyl
carbon.

00:14:39.033 --> 00:14:41.333
So from compound one,
you would get this.

00:14:41.333 --> 00:14:44.467
Add in CN here and turn it
into carboxylic acid.

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:47.767
From compound II, the ketone
on the next position down,

00:14:47.767 --> 00:14:52.200
you'd add here and get
that carboxylic acid.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:59.333
So the question is, if it has
this structure, then you add

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:00.400
HCN and HCl.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.600
You get this--

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.567
and it's very concentrated HCl
he used, incidentally--

00:15:04.567 --> 00:15:09.000
or if it's the next one
down, you get this.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.333
OK.

00:15:09.333 --> 00:15:10.900
So you do it and decide.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.367
All you have to know is
which product you get.

00:15:13.367 --> 00:15:15.500
Get it pure, see what it is.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.500
The problem is, these things,
as almost all things are in

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.167
sugar chemistry, are syrups.

00:15:22.167 --> 00:15:24.767
It's very, very, very
difficult to get

00:15:24.767 --> 00:15:26.167
crystals from them.

00:15:26.167 --> 00:15:28.900
So it was really hard, in those
days, to purify things.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.067
Nowadays you to do
chromatography, maybe, or

00:15:31.067 --> 00:15:31.867
something like that.

00:15:31.867 --> 00:15:34.400
But then it was essentially
impossible.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.100
So they had to try to make
things simpler so that they

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.600
had a chance of crystallization.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.133
He says, "It must, upon
exhaustive reduction by

00:15:43.133 --> 00:15:48.733
concentrated HI, yield methyl
butyl acetic acid."--

00:15:48.733 --> 00:15:49.800
so this one--

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.967
the one on the top--

00:15:50.967 --> 00:15:56.400
would give methyl butyl acetic
acid, reduced with HI and

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.967
phosphorus.--"

00:15:57.967 --> 00:16:00.733
and on the contrary, the
carboxylic acid from compound II

00:16:00.733 --> 00:16:04.833
would give ethyl
propyl acetic acid.

00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:08.533
So all you have to do is know
which of these you've got.

00:16:08.533 --> 00:16:11.100
And he said, this is fine.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.600
But when he did the reaction
and got the product, which

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.600
should be either this or this,
he says, "[It] does not agree

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.733
with the description that Hecht
gives of the Ca

00:16:21.733 --> 00:16:24.200
salt of methylbutyl
acetic acid."

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.800
So Hecht, he said, had done
a lot of good work on this

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.633
compound, including making
the calcium salt.

00:16:29.633 --> 00:16:31.900
He was able to crystallize
the calcium salt of

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.167
the product he got.

00:16:33.167 --> 00:16:36.233
And it didn't agree
with Hecht.

00:16:36.233 --> 00:16:43.967
So he says, "which means that my
heptanoic acid is identical

00:16:43.967 --> 00:16:46.433
with ethylpropylacetic acid."

00:16:46.433 --> 00:16:48.233
So this is the one he's got.

00:16:48.233 --> 00:16:50.600
But that compound wasn't
known, so he couldn't

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.033
be sure about it.

00:16:53.033 --> 00:16:55.633
But anyhow, he concluded that
it must be this, since it's

00:16:55.633 --> 00:16:58.167
not Hecht's compound.

00:16:58.167 --> 00:17:09.033
Now the next year, in 1886, he
reacted ethyl acetoacetate.

00:17:09.033 --> 00:17:13.533
So this is acetyl group
on acetic ester.

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:14.833
What's special about
those hydrogens?

00:17:18.233 --> 00:17:20.533
Active methylene adjacent
to two carbonyls.

00:17:20.533 --> 00:17:23.600
You make the anion, you
can put an R group on.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.433
You can make the anion again,
put another R group on.

00:17:27.433 --> 00:17:32.167
So he put on ethyl.

00:17:32.167 --> 00:17:34.767
Put on propyl.

00:17:34.767 --> 00:17:37.900
And then, what I told you last
time is that when you

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.867
hydrolyze this, you get
the acid, and then it

00:17:41.867 --> 00:17:43.500
decarboxylates.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:48.700
So from the acetoacetic ester
synthesis, you lose CO2 and

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.867
get a ketone.

00:17:49.867 --> 00:17:52.533
But he did it differently
in those days.

00:17:52.533 --> 00:17:56.633
He used really, really
strong KOH, which

00:17:56.633 --> 00:17:58.400
doesn't give a ketone.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.867
It gives acetate.

00:18:00.867 --> 00:18:04.600
That is, the hydroxide
attacks here.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.167
Acetic acid comes off,
generating that anion, which

00:18:08.167 --> 00:18:10.633
then picks up a proton
from the acetic acid.

00:18:10.633 --> 00:18:16.767
So you have acetate
and an acid anion.

00:18:16.767 --> 00:18:19.567
Which you then put a proton
on, and you've got this.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.200
So he made authentic stuff, but
it didn't agree with what

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.367
he got from levulose.

00:18:29.367 --> 00:18:33.300
So now from Hecht, he knows it
wasn't this, and from his own

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.700
work, he knows it's not that.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.167
So now he began to wonder
about Hecht and just

00:18:39.167 --> 00:18:42.733
how good Hecht was.

00:18:42.733 --> 00:18:45.800
So he went on and did the same
thing, putting on methyl and

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.333
butyl, to make this.

00:18:49.333 --> 00:18:52.867
And he compared it with the
product from this, and found

00:18:52.867 --> 00:18:56.000
that the calcium, barium,
strontium, and lead salts all

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.900
agreed in their properties.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.533
So Hecht was wrong.

00:18:59.533 --> 00:19:02.067
He said at the end of the paper
that Hecht is going to

00:19:02.067 --> 00:19:04.367
go back and look at this
a little more.

00:19:04.367 --> 00:19:08.900
But at any rate, he was then
able to prove that levulose or

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.800
fructose has that structure.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.200
The carbonyl is in the
second position.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.800
So he now knows the constitution
of fructose.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:25.267
This paper from 1887 is on the
composition and constitution

00:19:25.267 --> 00:19:28.200
of arabaric acid
and arabinose.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.200
So now he's going to look
at a different sugar.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.467
And what he says is, "In a
report dated 27 November 1886,

00:19:35.467 --> 00:19:39.100
I showed, on the one hand, that
arabaric acid, formed by

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:43.700
oxidation of arabinose, has the
formula shown there, but

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.933
on the other hand, described
several derivatives of

00:19:46.933 --> 00:19:51.367
arabinose carboxylic acid
with the formula C7."

00:19:51.367 --> 00:19:59.300
So it was uncertain whether
arabinose was a five carbon

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.267
sugar or a six carbon sugar.

00:20:02.267 --> 00:20:05.267
If it was a five carbon sugar
and he oxidized it, he'd get

00:20:05.267 --> 00:20:06.000
five carbons.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.833
If it was a six carbon sugar,
and he added HCN to add

00:20:10.833 --> 00:20:13.500
another carbon, he
would get C7.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.333
So here says, he admits
that he had said

00:20:16.333 --> 00:20:17.533
contradictory things.

00:20:17.533 --> 00:20:20.400
One that implied that it
was C5, another that

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.300
implied it was C6.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.900
"Since at that time I had no
basis in truth to dispute the

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.700
generally accepted formula for
arabinose, which is that it's

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.267
C6."

00:20:30.267 --> 00:20:33.900
The analyses are very similar
to one another, whether it's

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:34.967
one or the other.

00:20:34.967 --> 00:20:37.700
"and my analytical results
did not contradict either

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:38.200
assumption."

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.500
So he couldn't be sure whether
arabinose, the stuff that came

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:48.300
from gum arabic, was C5 or C6.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.067
So he took arabinose.

00:20:50.067 --> 00:20:54.967
He added HCN He made the
arabinose carboxylic acid, the

00:20:54.967 --> 00:20:58.100
stuff that he talked
about up there,

00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.933
but he said then it was C7.

00:20:59.933 --> 00:21:02.600
Here he made it with one, two,
three, four, five, six.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.800
Here he made the six--

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.300
assuming that it starts
with five, right?

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:12.467
And he was able to reduce that
with sodium with mercury to

00:21:12.467 --> 00:21:17.333
get mannitol, which was
known to be C6.

00:21:17.333 --> 00:21:20.900
So it was clear that arabinose
wasn't a C6 sugar.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.267
It was a C5 sugar.

00:21:22.267 --> 00:21:25.400
So he had resolved this.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:29.100
But it was pointed out that--
One of the reasons it was

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.200
difficult to work with this
was this original

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.867
compound was a mixture.

00:21:33.867 --> 00:21:36.267
Why would it be a mixture?

00:21:36.267 --> 00:21:41.300
Because the cyanide could add to
either face of this carbon

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:45.233
to make right- or left-handed
carbon.

00:21:45.233 --> 00:21:48.333
And these other carbons are,
of course, chiral, too.

00:21:48.333 --> 00:21:51.067
So you get diastereomers,
depending on which

00:21:51.067 --> 00:21:52.700
side you add from.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.533
This was pointed out by someone
who was very sensitive

00:21:55.533 --> 00:21:59.600
to not just the constitution,
the sequence of bonds, but to

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.767
the configuration of these
sugars, which is going to make

00:22:02.767 --> 00:22:03.767
a lot of difference.

00:22:03.767 --> 00:22:05.667
With so many chiral centers,
there are going

00:22:05.667 --> 00:22:07.400
to be lots of isomers.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.633
So the person who pointed that
out was an Emil Fischer, who

00:22:10.633 --> 00:22:16.033
was three years older than
Kiliani, and died much sooner,

00:22:16.033 --> 00:22:18.700
for reasons you'll see.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:23.733
So one thing he did with
Kiliani's acid--

00:22:23.733 --> 00:22:28.000
this is the acid you get by
adding CN to the five-carbon

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.267
sugar, and then hydrolyzing
it.

00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:34.167
So Kiliani treated it
with sodium and

00:22:34.167 --> 00:22:37.033
mercury, and got mannitol.

00:22:37.033 --> 00:22:39.433
But Fischer did something
different.

00:22:39.433 --> 00:22:41.000
Bear in mind, this
is a reduction.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.900
So you take the acid all
the way to the alcohol.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.500
It's very difficult to
stop at the aldehyde.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.933
But Fischer found a way to stop
at the aldehyde, which

00:22:49.933 --> 00:22:54.767
was to first heat it to make
this lactone, a cyclic ester,

00:22:54.767 --> 00:22:58.433
and then reduce that with sodium
and mercury, and now he

00:22:58.433 --> 00:23:00.600
got the aldehyde here.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.700
Now, why was that handy?

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.867
Because it gave a way
to convert one sugar

00:23:05.867 --> 00:23:07.533
into another sugar.

00:23:07.533 --> 00:23:11.700
Now you could make new sugars
synthetically, because it was

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.567
possible to stop at
the aldehyde.

00:23:14.567 --> 00:23:17.400
So a Kiliani-Fischer
synthesis on

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:22.467
arabinose gave this compound.

00:23:22.467 --> 00:23:26.033
So Kiliani-Fischer synthesis
elongates an aldose, makes it

00:23:26.033 --> 00:23:28.333
one carbon longer.

00:23:28.333 --> 00:23:28.700
OK.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:34.200
Now, that wasn't the reason
Fischer got the Nobel Prize.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.600
A contributing factor
was phenylhydrazine.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.067
When he was a graduate student,
he synthesized

00:23:40.067 --> 00:23:43.833
phenylhydrazine, and he loved
to make derivatives with it.

00:23:43.833 --> 00:23:46.133
Remember, we talked about how
you could make derivatives of

00:23:46.133 --> 00:23:52.133
carbonyl compounds with N-N
things to make imine bonds,

00:23:52.133 --> 00:23:54.033
and they're very strong,
if you have two Ns

00:23:54.033 --> 00:23:55.467
together like that.

00:23:55.467 --> 00:24:00.233
So he could do it with sugars.

00:24:00.233 --> 00:24:04.900
You could react with a sugar,
and make an imine.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.467
It's called a hydrazone,
right?

00:24:07.467 --> 00:24:12.033
Now, this hydrogen here is
allylic, so it could shift up

00:24:12.033 --> 00:24:14.467
to here and make the
double bond here.

00:24:14.467 --> 00:24:17.467
But now this hydrogen is
allylic, and it could shift to

00:24:17.467 --> 00:24:19.633
there, so you can get this.

00:24:19.633 --> 00:24:22.133
Now you've got another ketone.

00:24:22.133 --> 00:24:23.400
So what's going to happen?

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.600
You can make another
hydrazone.

00:24:31.533 --> 00:24:36.800
So now you've used the second
mole of phenylhydrazine.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.633
So now that one's allylic.

00:24:38.633 --> 00:24:40.000
You can shift it over here.

00:24:44.267 --> 00:24:46.933
Here we do a cyclic
rearrangement.

00:24:46.933 --> 00:24:49.067
This hydrogen goes
to that nitrogen.

00:24:49.067 --> 00:24:51.000
This bond breaks.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.133
These electrons go here to make
a double bond, becomes a

00:24:54.133 --> 00:24:56.233
single, double.

00:24:56.233 --> 00:24:58.533
So it breaks apart into
two molecules,

00:24:58.533 --> 00:25:01.433
one of which leaves.

00:25:01.433 --> 00:25:04.733
And now we have a C=N double
bond, which is very like a C=O

00:25:04.733 --> 00:25:06.433
double bond, so you can get a

00:25:06.433 --> 00:25:07.900
third molecule of
phenylhydrazine

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:12.467
to react and make a
new C=N double bond, losing

00:25:12.467 --> 00:25:15.667
ammonia, and you get this
compound, that has two of his

00:25:15.667 --> 00:25:18.333
favorite molecules stitched
in there.

00:25:18.333 --> 00:25:20.633
It's called an osazone.

00:25:20.633 --> 00:25:24.500
It's a hydrazone that's made
from an ose, from a sugar.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.533
By treating this with his
favorite compound,

00:25:33.533 --> 00:25:34.767
you could make this.

00:25:34.767 --> 00:25:38.100
Now, it was his favorite
compound, but

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.967
it's also deadly poisonous.

00:25:39.967 --> 00:25:42.900
And he poisoned himself very
badly for almost a decade

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.100
he was in very bad health
because of poisoning

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.033
himself with this.

00:25:46.033 --> 00:25:50.267
And in fact, in 1919, he
committed suicide.

00:25:50.267 --> 00:25:53.667
He had cancer at the time, and
who knows whether it had to do

00:25:53.667 --> 00:25:57.700
with exposure to his
favorite molecule.

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.167
But if what was so dangerous,
and he knew he was being

00:26:00.167 --> 00:26:03.100
poisoned, why did he
like it so much?

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.333
It was because ozasones
are crystalline.

00:26:06.333 --> 00:26:08.767
Remember, these sugars are
always syrups, and you can't

00:26:08.767 --> 00:26:09.933
do anything with them.

00:26:09.933 --> 00:26:13.600
But with crystals, you could
purify and tell what things

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.300
were, tell if one thing
is the same as

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.867
something else or different.

00:26:16.867 --> 00:26:20.167
So that was the beauty, for
him, of phenylhydrazine.

00:26:20.167 --> 00:26:23.033
That you could make an
osazone and identify

00:26:23.033 --> 00:26:25.433
things in sugar chemistry.

00:26:28.833 --> 00:26:35.500
So he was interested in
identifying the structures of

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.467
these things.

00:26:36.467 --> 00:26:41.600
So let's try to be systematic
about seeing what the

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.200
configurations could be
of different sugars.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.133
Let's look at the hexoses.

00:26:47.133 --> 00:26:50.933
We all we already
have erythrose,

00:26:50.933 --> 00:26:53.467
arabinose, and xylose.

00:26:53.467 --> 00:26:55.767
Arabinose came from gum arabic,

00:26:55.767 --> 00:26:57.700
xylose came from wood.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.700
Erythrose comes from a lichen.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:06.400
Eryth means red in Greek, so
erythrose was because it came

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.167
from this red plant.

00:27:09.167 --> 00:27:13.333
But there were also hexoses
glucose, mannose, galactose,

00:27:13.333 --> 00:27:15.000
and gulose.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.900
And all these were identified
by Kiliani as being aldoses.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.567
Aldehydes, not ketones.

00:27:22.567 --> 00:27:25.967
We showed how he could tell
the difference there.

00:27:25.967 --> 00:27:31.200
So these must differ in
their configuration.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.000
Right?

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.833
Now, how many should there be?

00:27:34.833 --> 00:27:37.367
If you have six carbons in
a chain that ends in an

00:27:37.367 --> 00:27:40.700
aldehyde, how many
should there be?

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.700
Well, for this purpose,
we could write them

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.200
all out like this.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:49.633
This is a particular one,
using what projection?

00:27:49.633 --> 00:27:50.333
STUDENT: Fischer projection.

00:27:50.333 --> 00:27:51.833
PROFESSOR: The Fischer
projection.

00:27:51.833 --> 00:27:55.100
And one of the most amazing
things about Fischer is that

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.267
he figured this all out without
having the Fischer

00:27:58.267 --> 00:27:59.400
projection.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.333
It's easy for us to trace his
thought now using the Fischer

00:28:03.333 --> 00:28:06.467
projection, but he used van 't
Hoff's notation, which was

00:28:06.467 --> 00:28:08.067
very, very complicated.

00:28:08.067 --> 00:28:11.300
And I have never
figured it out.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.967
So that's one of the real
triumphs of Fischer, was to be

00:28:13.967 --> 00:28:16.800
able to think through this
stuff without Fischer

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.100
projections, which he published
the next year.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.767
But we could abbreviate that
Fischer projection by writing

00:28:23.767 --> 00:28:24.467
it that way.

00:28:24.467 --> 00:28:26.500
Whoops, I wrote it wrong here.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.433
These lines show which
way the OH points.

00:28:29.433 --> 00:28:32.733
So the bottom, you don't
care, it's not chiral.

00:28:32.733 --> 00:28:35.333
The next one, the OH to right,
OH to the right, that one

00:28:35.333 --> 00:28:38.133
should be OH to the left,
OH to the right.

00:28:38.133 --> 00:28:40.067
So the code is clear.

00:28:40.067 --> 00:28:44.200
Now we can just write out
all the possibilities.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:54.600
So there are four chiral
carbons, so there are going to

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.200
be 16 possible isomers.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.667
But if we're looking only at
the D-sugars, those are the

00:29:01.667 --> 00:29:04.933
ones that are all to the
right on the bottom.

00:29:04.933 --> 00:29:07.667
We could draw the mirror image,
too, the L-sugars.

00:29:07.667 --> 00:29:10.200
But let's keep it simple just
by showing the D sugars,

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.000
because as Fischer well knew,
he had no way of telling D

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.067
from L. You could measure the
rotation, but not the absolute

00:29:18.067 --> 00:29:19.067
configuration.

00:29:19.067 --> 00:29:22.400
So let's just assume that
a given compound

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.200
is D in the D series.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.867
Now, how can you draw
them all out?

00:29:26.867 --> 00:29:30.167
You can draw right, right,
right, right, left, left,

00:29:30.167 --> 00:29:31.900
left, left.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.533
Then you can go right, right,
left, left, right, right,

00:29:35.533 --> 00:29:39.933
left, left and finally right,
left, right, left, right,

00:29:39.933 --> 00:29:41.300
left, right, left.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:46.267
So you've got eight isomers,
and four of them must be

00:29:46.267 --> 00:29:49.000
glucose, mannose, galactose,
and gulose.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.800
But not arabinose and xylose,
because as we just saw,

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.267
Kiliani showed that arabinose
was a five-carbon sugar, not a

00:29:56.267 --> 00:29:57.400
six-carbon sugar.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.467
It's a pentose.

00:29:58.467 --> 00:30:01.933
An erythrose is a tetrose,
a four-carbon sugar.

00:30:01.933 --> 00:30:04.933
And finally, at the top, you
have glyceraldehyde, the one

00:30:04.933 --> 00:30:10.000
that Fischer chose as the
reference for what's D.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.367
So the question only
is which is which?

00:30:14.367 --> 00:30:17.500
And at first glance, that looks
impossible, until you

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.900
come along with X-ray or NMR,
maybe, or something

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:22.067
to figure it out.

00:30:22.067 --> 00:30:23.633
But Fischer figured it out.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.100
So here was the evidence
he used.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.167
You can look online on the
website and see the

00:30:32.167 --> 00:30:34.967
translation of his paper,
how he actually did it.

00:30:34.967 --> 00:30:42.567
Almost all textbooks nod and
cover this a little bit,

00:30:42.567 --> 00:30:45.433
because it's realized what a
great contribution it was.

00:30:45.433 --> 00:30:47.667
I mean, it's like Shakespeare
or something like that.

00:30:47.667 --> 00:30:48.967
But they all mess it up.

00:30:48.967 --> 00:30:51.833
They use modern reagents, they
say it should have worked this

00:30:51.833 --> 00:30:52.600
way, or something.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.867
This is what Fischer actually
did, so you can read about it.

00:30:55.867 --> 00:30:58.133
But anyhow, this is the
evidence he used.

00:30:58.133 --> 00:31:02.767
He found that glucose could be
oxidized by nitric acid to

00:31:02.767 --> 00:31:04.700
make the compound that
is an acid on

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.300
both ends of the chain.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.700
So it's symmetrical with
respect to acid.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.900
Not just the aldehyde, but also
the primary alcohol got

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.600
oxidized to an acid.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.767
And then he did his heating to
make a lactone reduce it with

00:31:18.767 --> 00:31:24.833
sodium, which made it back
into a sugar again.

00:31:24.833 --> 00:31:29.333
And the sugar he got
he called gulose.

00:31:29.333 --> 00:31:31.567
It's different from what
he started with.

00:31:31.567 --> 00:31:35.467
You'd think if you oxidize and
then reduce back again, you

00:31:35.467 --> 00:31:37.767
got the same thing
you started with.

00:31:37.767 --> 00:31:42.800
But he could get a different
sugar this way, Why?

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.300
How could it be different?

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:51.900
It could be the aldehyde was
on the top, made two acids,

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:56.067
reduced the top to an alcohol
and the bottom to an aldehyde.

00:31:56.067 --> 00:31:59.967
So now it's upside down, so
you'd have to rotate it.

00:31:59.967 --> 00:32:02.667
So it could be a different one
of these sugars that we drew

00:32:02.667 --> 00:32:05.400
on the last slide.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.467
And he decided to
call it gulose.

00:32:07.467 --> 00:32:08.700
Why?

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.067
It's a sort of an anagram.

00:32:17.067 --> 00:32:21.200
It reverses the U and the
L. Glucose, gulose.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.233
Because he went end for end.

00:32:23.233 --> 00:32:28.833
So, you know, chemists sometimes
have sort of geeky

00:32:28.833 --> 00:32:31.333
senses of humor, right?

00:32:31.333 --> 00:32:33.833
So gulose.

00:32:33.833 --> 00:32:35.767
So that was the first
evidence.

00:32:35.767 --> 00:32:41.133
And then subsidiary evidence for
that is that the diacid he

00:32:41.133 --> 00:32:44.767
got on the way is
chiral, and both

00:32:44.767 --> 00:32:48.367
enantiomers of it were known.

00:32:48.367 --> 00:32:50.400
That's the first line
of evidence.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.933
The second line of evidence is
that glucose and mannose give

00:32:53.933 --> 00:32:55.600
the same osazone.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.433
Remember, he made osazones to
make crystals, but glucose and

00:32:58.433 --> 00:33:00.100
mannose gave the same one.

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:04.233
Also, arabinose, if you do a
Kiliani reaction, gives two

00:33:04.233 --> 00:33:05.167
different acids.

00:33:05.167 --> 00:33:07.000
Gluconic and mannonic acid.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.633
We talked about that before,
that it could add either side.

00:33:10.633 --> 00:33:14.100
And fructose, when it's reduced
to give alcohols all

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.833
along the chain, gives two
different alcohols, glucitol

00:33:16.833 --> 00:33:17.833
and mannitol.

00:33:17.833 --> 00:33:21.200
And notice all of these are
glucose-related and

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.600
mannose-related.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.233
So there's some special
relationship between glucose

00:33:25.233 --> 00:33:29.467
in mannose, that all three
of these things do that.

00:33:29.467 --> 00:33:31.667
The second line of evidence
is mannitol and

00:33:31.667 --> 00:33:34.633
mannonic acid are chiral.

00:33:34.633 --> 00:33:39.633
So if you have OHs on both it
ends or acids on both ends,

00:33:39.633 --> 00:33:40.900
it's chiral.

00:33:42.833 --> 00:33:45.833
Bear in mind that people were
just fiddling around, seeing

00:33:45.833 --> 00:33:47.300
what they could make
from what.

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:52.300
But Fischer collected the key
items of evidence that could

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:56.100
be used to make a real
logical argument.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.233
So third, arabinose, when
he did a Kiliani-Fischer

00:33:59.233 --> 00:34:01.467
synthesis, gave glucose.

00:34:01.467 --> 00:34:03.233
But also, it gave mannose.

00:34:03.233 --> 00:34:03.533
Right?

00:34:03.533 --> 00:34:07.200
Now we see this relationship
between gluc- and man-.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:11.733
And xylose, which
came from wood--

00:34:11.733 --> 00:34:14.300
that's the, like, xylophone,
right?--

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:19.033
xylose, wood sugar, by the
Kiliani-Fischer synthesis,

00:34:19.033 --> 00:34:21.600
added a carbon and
made gulose.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.467
Remember, this one up here.

00:34:23.467 --> 00:34:26.533
And also another compound
which I think is one

00:34:26.533 --> 00:34:28.967
called idose now.

00:34:28.967 --> 00:34:32.767
But these aren't really
relevant.

00:34:32.767 --> 00:34:35.033
But then 3a, arabinose.

00:34:35.033 --> 00:34:39.900
If you make two OHs, or two
carboxylic acids on each end,

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.500
is optically active.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:45.533
But xylose gives inactive
compounds with OH on both

00:34:45.533 --> 00:34:47.233
ends, or acid on both ends.

00:34:47.233 --> 00:34:48.733
In fact, that was tough.

00:34:48.733 --> 00:34:51.533
Because arabitol has
no rotation.

00:34:51.533 --> 00:34:54.600
You put it in, you think
it's not chiral.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:35:01.200
But if you add boric acid,
then it rotates light.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.500
Remember, it's hard to know
what causes rotation.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:08.900
And it just happens that
arabitol has no rotation, or

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.933
unmeasurably small rotation.

00:35:10.933 --> 00:35:13.133
But if you make a derivative
of it, then you can see--

00:35:13.133 --> 00:35:14.733
and the acid is rotating.

00:35:14.733 --> 00:35:17.800
So it required a lot of work to
know these things for sure.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.967
So that's the evidence, and
therefore, he knows what

00:35:20.967 --> 00:35:25.600
glucose is and what all
the others are.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.200
That's pretty much of an
accomplishment, right?

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:33.300
Just to conceive that on the
basis of this evidence you

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.067
could figure it out
is amazing.

00:35:35.067 --> 00:35:39.300
And this is only fifteen years
after van 't Hoff proposed the

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.267
tetrahedral carbon, and
a lot of people still

00:35:41.267 --> 00:35:44.533
didn't believe in it.

00:35:44.533 --> 00:35:49.400
So here are the hexoses
and pentoses.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.233
And we're going to go through
his lines of evidence and see

00:35:52.233 --> 00:35:55.067
how his logic worked.

00:35:55.067 --> 00:36:00.467
Evidence 1 was that glucose
gives a diacid, and on heating

00:36:00.467 --> 00:36:02.600
and reducing, it gives gulose.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:08.267
So when you turn it end for
end, then you've got a

00:36:08.267 --> 00:36:09.533
different compound.

00:36:12.033 --> 00:36:13.733
So let's go across and see.

00:36:13.733 --> 00:36:15.733
Would that be true of this?

00:36:15.733 --> 00:36:18.033
If you turned it end
for end, would it

00:36:18.033 --> 00:36:19.267
be a different compound?

00:36:21.367 --> 00:36:23.833
Remember, with a Fischer
projection, the idea is things

00:36:23.833 --> 00:36:25.200
turn out at you.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.867
So can't rotate 90
degrees, but you

00:36:27.867 --> 00:36:30.033
can rotate 180 degrees.

00:36:30.033 --> 00:36:33.400
So if we rotate this one 180
degrees, do we get the same

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.667
thing again?

00:36:35.667 --> 00:36:41.100
That is, what you do here with
this is make a dot on the

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:44.100
bottom and not on the top, so
then you have to rotate it to

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.800
bring it back into this series
that we've drawn here.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.400
Right?

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.467
Obviously, those would all
point to the left.

00:36:49.467 --> 00:36:52.600
It would be the mirror image
of the one we started with.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:56.967
So we'll put that on the back
burner for a second.

00:36:59.867 --> 00:37:01.033
How about the next one?

00:37:01.033 --> 00:37:03.400
If you turn that end for end,
does it look the same, if you

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.767
put the dot on the bottom
and rotate it?

00:37:05.767 --> 00:37:07.800
Obviously different.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.900
Is everybody with me on
its being different?

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.700
That one will be different.

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.000
This one, however,
will be the same.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.400
If you rotate it 180 degrees,
it's going to be left, left,

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.200
right, right again.

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.900
If you change top to
bottom and rotate.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:30.467
So that one is not glucose, nor
is it gulose, because if

00:37:30.467 --> 00:37:31.833
you rotate end for end
it's different.

00:37:31.833 --> 00:37:32.633
How about the next one?

00:37:32.633 --> 00:37:34.933
Will that be different?

00:37:34.933 --> 00:37:36.200
Should we take it out?

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.667
That'll be different.

00:37:37.667 --> 00:37:39.233
Will that be different?

00:37:39.233 --> 00:37:41.200
Ah, that's going
to be the same.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.633
Not different.

00:37:42.633 --> 00:37:44.367
So we can take that one out.

00:37:44.367 --> 00:37:45.267
How about the next one?

00:37:45.267 --> 00:37:47.767
Will that be different?

00:37:47.767 --> 00:37:49.933
That's going to be like the
first one, where everything

00:37:49.933 --> 00:37:51.600
that's right is going to be
left, everything that's left

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.600
is going to be right.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.100
So we'll put that in abeyance
for a while.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:56.800
And the last one also
is different.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.767
So from Item 1, we know for
sure that it's not that and

00:37:59.767 --> 00:38:01.833
not that glucose.

00:38:01.833 --> 00:38:04.633
Now, item 1a--

00:38:04.633 --> 00:38:07.667
and we're not so confident about
that, because it changes

00:38:07.667 --> 00:38:09.167
the hand in this only.

00:38:09.167 --> 00:38:12.267
But the diacid is chiral.

00:38:12.267 --> 00:38:14.200
Both the enantiomers are
known when the two

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.300
ends are the same.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.633
So with this one, if the
two ends were the

00:38:19.633 --> 00:38:22.600
same, would it be chiral?

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:22.733
No.

00:38:22.733 --> 00:38:24.200
It would have a horizontal
plane of

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.700
symmetry through the middle.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:28.300
So it can't be that one.

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.700
This one, would that have
a plane of symmetry?

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.600
No, No.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.100
That one's out already.

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:35.300
How about that one?

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:36.567
No.

00:38:36.567 --> 00:38:37.633
How about that one?

00:38:37.633 --> 00:38:38.300
Ah.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:39.200
That one's out.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.900
That wouldn't be chiral.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:42.067
The last one would be chiral.

00:38:42.067 --> 00:38:42.367
OK.

00:38:42.367 --> 00:38:45.800
So from 1a, we confirm
that it's not that

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.600
and it's not that.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.200
So we're down to four
candidates for

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.967
what could be glucose.

00:38:50.967 --> 00:38:52.800
Now we go to Item 2.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.300
Glucose and mannose give
the same osazone.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.000
Remember what the osazone did?

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.667
It made a double bond at the top
carbon and a double bond

00:39:00.667 --> 00:39:01.967
at the next carbon.

00:39:01.967 --> 00:39:06.367
So that means this next carbon
here isn't chiral anymore.

00:39:06.367 --> 00:39:07.300
Right?

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:11.200
And if you take arabinose,
start with that being the

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.433
carbonyl and add CN, it can
add to either side.

00:39:14.433 --> 00:39:18.067
One would give that, one
would give that.

00:39:18.067 --> 00:39:21.100
Depending on what arabinose is,
one would give this, this,

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.567
one would give that, that, one
would give that, that.

00:39:23.567 --> 00:39:26.800
So again, it says they differ
only at this second carbon.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:30.700
And fructose, which has a ketone
at the second carbon,

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:34.067
as Kiliani showed, gives
two alcohols.

00:39:34.067 --> 00:39:37.033
So it could give this alcohol
and that alcohol, this

00:39:37.033 --> 00:39:38.967
alcohol, that alcohol, 
and so on.

00:39:38.967 --> 00:39:43.400
So anyhow, what that means
is you disregard that.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:49.633
So this Item 2 shows that
glucose and mannose differ only

00:39:49.633 --> 00:39:50.900
in this carbon.

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:55.533
So now, when we look at Evidence
2, we know that if

00:39:55.533 --> 00:39:59.000
this is glucose,
this is mannose.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.300
They differ only at that carbon,
which this shows is not

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.433
relevant here.

00:40:03.433 --> 00:40:03.900
OK.

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:05.767
So if this is glucose,
this is mannose.

00:40:05.767 --> 00:40:09.033
If this is glucose,
what's mannose?

00:40:09.033 --> 00:40:11.100
This one, right?

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:15.300
If this is glucose,
this is mannose.

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:19.167
And if this is glucose,
this is mannose.

00:40:19.167 --> 00:40:22.300
That's what 
Evidence 2 shows.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.967
Now, Evidence 2a is
that mannitol,

00:40:25.967 --> 00:40:29.000
OH on both ends, or acid
on both ends,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.900
those molecules are chiral.

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:35.733
So can this be mannose if the
two ends are the same?

00:40:35.733 --> 00:40:37.133
Is it handed?

00:40:37.133 --> 00:40:38.367
No.

00:40:38.367 --> 00:40:42.900
So this can't be glucose.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.467
How about this?

00:40:44.467 --> 00:40:46.800
Could this be mannose?

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.767
If the two ends are the same,
will it be chiral?

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:51.933
No.

00:40:51.933 --> 00:40:53.467
It doesn't have a mirror
in the middle.

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.733
It's a propeller.

00:41:00.733 --> 00:41:02.233
It's not a chiral.

00:41:02.233 --> 00:41:05.500
The one that's right at the top
and left at the bottom is

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:06.433
the mirror image of this.

00:41:06.433 --> 00:41:08.567
Not identical to it.

00:41:08.567 --> 00:41:11.367
So it could be could
still be that.

00:41:11.367 --> 00:41:13.500
Could this be mannose?

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.500
Yes.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.767
That means this could
be glucose.

00:41:16.767 --> 00:41:20.033
Could this be mannose?

00:41:20.033 --> 00:41:22.467
No, because now it has a
mirror in the middle.

00:41:22.467 --> 00:41:23.800
So that can't be glucose.

00:41:26.433 --> 00:41:29.167
So from 2a, then, we can exclude
this, and we can

00:41:29.167 --> 00:41:32.033
exclude that.

00:41:32.033 --> 00:41:36.500
So one of these must be glucose,
and the other one is

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:41.667
gulose, the one that's turned
end for end, top to bottom.

00:41:41.667 --> 00:41:44.800
So how we going to decide
that, or how did Fischer

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.267
decide that?

00:41:45.267 --> 00:41:46.967
He went to Evidence 3.

00:41:46.967 --> 00:41:51.267
Which is, arabinose, in the
Kiliani-Fischer synthesis,

00:41:51.267 --> 00:41:55.700
gives glucose, and xylose
gives gulose.

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:59.900
So one of them gives one of
these, and the other one gives

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:03.067
the other one of those.

00:42:03.067 --> 00:42:06.967
So we know something now about
arabinose and xylose.

00:42:06.967 --> 00:42:09.700
They can't be this, and they
can't be this, because that,

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.767
on a Kiliani-Fischer synthesis,
couldn't give

00:42:11.767 --> 00:42:15.767
either of these, and this
couldn't give either of those.

00:42:15.767 --> 00:42:17.067
So those are out.

00:42:17.067 --> 00:42:21.433
That one's out and that one's
out for arabinose and xylose.

00:42:21.433 --> 00:42:27.000
But what we know from Evidence
3 is that if this is glucose,

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.367
that one had to be arabinose,
the thing that you add another

00:42:30.367 --> 00:42:33.733
carbon here and make that.

00:42:33.733 --> 00:42:36.000
And if this was glucose, that
would be arabinose.

00:42:39.033 --> 00:42:39.900
And vice versa.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.133
If it's arabinose,
it's glucose.

00:42:45.267 --> 00:42:48.200
So if we know arabinose, which
is arabinose and which is

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:52.133
xylose, then we know which is
glucose and which is gulose,

00:42:52.133 --> 00:42:53.400
because of those connections.

00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:00.633
So Evidence 3a is arabinose
gives optically active

00:43:00.633 --> 00:43:03.200
arabitol and arabaric acid.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.433
When the two ends are the
same, it's chiral.

00:43:06.433 --> 00:43:10.400
But xylose is not chiral when
the two ends are the same.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:11.633
OK.

00:43:11.633 --> 00:43:13.733
Could this one be arabinose?

00:43:13.733 --> 00:43:17.067
Would it be chiral if the
two ends are the same?

00:43:17.067 --> 00:43:18.967
How about that one?

00:43:18.967 --> 00:43:20.600
No.

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:24.100
So that one's got to be
arabinose, and that one's got

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:25.367
to be xylose.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.200
So we know that glucose
can't be this, because

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.267
it comes from arabinose.

00:43:33.267 --> 00:43:36.733
So that one is glucose.

00:43:36.733 --> 00:43:38.000
So he proved it!

00:43:45.433 --> 00:43:50.967
So all these known compounds
were then assigned.

00:43:50.967 --> 00:43:53.800
If you knew this was glucose,
then you know that was gulose.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.767
You know that glucose
and mannose differ

00:43:55.767 --> 00:43:56.800
only at this carbon.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.167
So you know which mannose is,
you know which arabinose is,

00:43:59.167 --> 00:44:00.500
which xylose is.

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.700
You also can figure out which
one it erythrose is, by making

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:05.967
arabinose from it.

00:44:05.967 --> 00:44:07.300
So all these things now work.

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:09.567
It's like the end of a
solitaire game, when

00:44:09.567 --> 00:44:12.367
everything begins
to work, right?

00:44:12.367 --> 00:44:13.933
So you now you get all
the other sugars.

00:44:13.933 --> 00:44:17.600
In fact, of these sixteen
sugars, the right- and left-

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:21.000
handed ones in the bottom row,
the hexose, of the sixteen

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.867
Fischer made, thirteen
of them himself.

00:44:23.867 --> 00:44:27.000
And he made fifty artificial
sugars overall

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.267
in the 1880s and 1890s.

00:44:31.267 --> 00:44:32.400
So he got others.

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:36.267
Like he also got threose.

00:44:36.267 --> 00:44:37.533
So this was a new compound.

00:44:37.533 --> 00:44:39.700
How did he name it?

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.167
Where did the name threose
come from?

00:44:42.167 --> 00:44:44.100
It's erythrose turned
around, right?

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:45.533
Sort of turned around.

00:44:45.533 --> 00:44:48.100
Or he got ribose.

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:51.900
Like ribonucleic acid,
deoxyribonucleic acid.

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:54.100
Where does the name
ribose come from?

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:54.467
STUDENT: Arabinose.

00:44:54.467 --> 00:44:56.300
PROFESSOR: From arabinose.

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.700
From gum arabic.

00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:59.767
Or he got lyxose.

00:44:59.767 --> 00:45:01.367
That's pretty obvious.

00:45:01.367 --> 00:45:06.867
Or you got talose from
galactose.

00:45:06.867 --> 00:45:08.533
T A L, OK?

00:45:08.533 --> 00:45:10.500
Or he got altrose.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.567
He was beginning to run out,
so this just means "another

00:45:13.567 --> 00:45:15.567
one." Alter, right?

00:45:15.567 --> 00:45:18.067
Or he got idose.

00:45:18.067 --> 00:45:21.767
That's idem, you know, the same
as the one above in a

00:45:21.767 --> 00:45:23.233
list is idem.

00:45:23.233 --> 00:45:25.433
So it's another one, right?

00:45:25.433 --> 00:45:28.267
Or alose, which is the Greek
version of altrose.

00:45:31.033 --> 00:45:33.933
So he got all these, and
he got the Nobel Prize.

00:45:33.933 --> 00:45:36.500
And he got the second
Nobel Prize.

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.500
The first Nobel Prize
went to van 't Hoff.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:45.033
Not for chirality, but for his
work in physical chemistry.

00:45:45.033 --> 00:45:48.533
But the second Nobel Prize went
to chirality via Fischer,

00:45:48.533 --> 00:45:51.433
because everybody realized what
a great contribution--

00:45:51.433 --> 00:45:53.767
you know, it's not
just doing it.

00:45:53.767 --> 00:45:57.100
but doing it without Fischer
projections is a lot tougher.

00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:00.200
It's to conceive that you can
do it, that the evidence is

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.733
there, that you apply this new
theory that van 't Hoff came

00:46:03.733 --> 00:46:07.533
up with not so long ago, and
follow it through with

00:46:07.533 --> 00:46:09.467
rigorous logic, and
you've got it.

00:46:09.467 --> 00:46:12.400
Rather just fiddling around,
making this, making this,

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.100
making this, making this,
he puts it all together.

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:17.233
He finds the crucial bits of
evidence and puts them

00:46:17.233 --> 00:46:19.367
together to do this really
beautiful proof.

00:46:19.367 --> 00:46:21.900
So I thought you would want
to know about that.

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:27.167
Now, if you want to remember
it, the guy

00:46:27.167 --> 00:46:28.233
who taught me Organic--

00:46:28.233 --> 00:46:30.367
I took Organic Chemistry
the way you are, 50

00:46:30.367 --> 00:46:33.000
years ago this year.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.033
And the guy that I took
it from, Louis

00:46:35.033 --> 00:46:36.933
Fieser, made up this.

00:46:36.933 --> 00:46:43.300
"All altruists gladly make gum
in gallon tanks." And I

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.300
remembered that for
fifty years.

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.167
So I have no trouble doing
alose, altrose, glucose,

00:46:48.167 --> 00:46:53.100
mannose, gulose, idose,
galactose, and tolose.

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:56.667
It's not a very fundamental
contribution to science, but

00:46:56.667 --> 00:47:00.433
it's very handy, if you want
to teach about hexoses.

00:47:00.433 --> 00:47:03.567
And if you want to do
this one, it's raxl.

00:47:03.567 --> 00:47:10.900
R A X L. And erythrose and
threose, you just remember.

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:11.333
OK.

00:47:11.333 --> 00:47:16.300
So hooray for Emil Fischer.

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:19.400
Now we've got two minutes
just to show you--

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.867
I'm not going to show you
how this happened.

00:47:21.867 --> 00:47:23.800
It's going to be a stream
of consciousness thing.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.933
You're not responsible
for it on the exam.

00:47:25.933 --> 00:47:28.833
But I've got all the slides
here, so what the hell, right?

00:47:28.833 --> 00:47:32.167
And it is a neat thing.

00:47:32.167 --> 00:47:33.000
OK.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.233
So we talked about
cyclobutadiene.

00:47:35.233 --> 00:47:37.400
Is it antiaromatic?

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.667
Make it and see what
its properties are.

00:47:39.667 --> 00:47:41.433
The problem is,

00:47:41.433 --> 00:47:43.100
So you can make it by this.

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:44.300
Shine light on it.

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:49.067
It closes up in in a disrotatory
process.

00:47:49.067 --> 00:47:54.067
And then with light, it loses
CO2, and you get it.

00:47:54.067 --> 00:47:55.767
So study its properties.

00:47:55.767 --> 00:48:00.367
The problem is that it undergoes
a really quick

00:48:00.367 --> 00:48:01.933
reaction with itself.

00:48:01.933 --> 00:48:05.533
A Diels-Alder reaction,
which gives this.

00:48:05.533 --> 00:48:09.800
And then that opens up, because
it's very strained, of

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:14.567
course, and gives
cyclooctatetraene.

00:48:14.567 --> 00:48:19.100
So you get cyclooctatetraene,
which is sort of evidence that

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.800
you had cyclobutadiene, but
it's not like knowing its

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.000
properties.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.333
So the problem is that it
reacts with itself.

00:48:28.333 --> 00:48:31.433
So it's presumptive evidence
of existence.

00:48:31.433 --> 00:48:33.967
Could you do spectroscopy?

00:48:33.967 --> 00:48:36.233
So you have to make it, somehow,
under conditions that

00:48:36.233 --> 00:48:38.100
it won't react with itself.

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:41.233
So if you made it inside a cage,
like a big clam shell,

00:48:41.233 --> 00:48:44.567
so only one molecule was in
there, then it couldn't react

00:48:44.567 --> 00:48:46.933
with itself.

00:48:46.933 --> 00:48:51.267
So they made this compound
with a guest inside.

00:48:51.267 --> 00:48:53.333
So it's two big, like
a clam shell.

00:48:53.333 --> 00:48:56.100
It holds the precursor inside.

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:59.200
There's a mouth that you can
put things in and out from.

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:02.633
And it was done by Donald Cram,
who got the Nobel Prize,

00:49:02.633 --> 00:49:07.133
and Martin Tanner, the son of
Dennis Tanner, who burned his

00:49:07.133 --> 00:49:10.300
eyebrows off with a Fourth
of July demonstration?

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:12.233
They grew back again,
you know, he was

00:49:12.233 --> 00:49:15.000
not permanently marred.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.933
Thomas, I don't know.

00:49:17.933 --> 00:49:21.667
So these R groups were big
things to make it soluble. And

00:49:21.667 --> 00:49:26.100
it was that, and you can make
that by thinking backwards

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:28.767
with an aldol reaction.

00:49:28.767 --> 00:49:32.100
So first, they make the bottom
half of the thing, and how to

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:36.600
form this big ring with
sixteen carbons in it.

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.800
You take resorcinol and

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:44.533
hydrocinnamaldehyde, and then--

00:49:44.533 --> 00:49:49.767
This is very active for
electrophilic substituition.

00:49:49.767 --> 00:49:52.767
So you protonate that, you have
an electrophile, it forms

00:49:52.767 --> 00:49:56.367
a bond, ortho-para, you've
got the first bond made.

00:49:56.367 --> 00:50:00.967
Put that in, dehydrate, you can
react it was another one,

00:50:00.967 --> 00:50:02.333
so you've got another one.

00:50:02.333 --> 00:50:04.100
Now you just keep doing
it to make all

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:05.100
those all the way around.

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:06.967
But you could imagine lots
and lots of different

00:50:06.967 --> 00:50:08.333
ways of doing it.

00:50:08.333 --> 00:50:11.000
And it turns out that the
electrophilic aromatic

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.367
substitution is reversible, and
ultimately, this compound,

00:50:14.367 --> 00:50:17.733
the one they wanted to make
this, precipitates from the

00:50:17.733 --> 00:50:21.400
equilibrated mixture
in a 69% yield.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:24.200
That is luck.

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:28.900
So the fish jumped into this
particular boat, right?

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.300
But now they need these bonds
across the top of

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:32.233
that bottom, too.

00:50:32.233 --> 00:50:35.267
The teeth for the clam.

00:50:35.267 --> 00:50:37.867
So what they did is they
put bromine on.

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:47.733
Then they made anions here with
base, and reacted with CH2

00:50:47.733 --> 00:50:49.200
with two leaving groups.

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.933
So one leaving group, the
other leaving group.

00:50:51.933 --> 00:50:54.933
And now do it on all the others,
and you've got those

00:50:54.933 --> 00:50:57.767
carbons put in.

00:50:57.767 --> 00:51:03.200
Now you have to join the top
half to the bottom half.

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.700
Oh, they got this,
incidentally.

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:06.367
They didn't get a 69% yield.

00:51:06.367 --> 00:51:09.000
That was 5% from the tetramer.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.100
And they had to isolate
it by chromatography.

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:15.867
So now they had to join the two
hemispheres, which they

00:51:15.867 --> 00:51:20.433
put a lithium on in place
of the bromine.

00:51:20.433 --> 00:51:26.967
And then they put boron on, and
then hydrogen peroxide,

00:51:26.967 --> 00:51:30.667
which we've seen before, to
make those into alcohols.

00:51:33.933 --> 00:51:36.000
We've seen that before.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.900
So you see, this was really to
be review of stuff we've done.

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.600
So now you've got alcohols
all the way up.

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:44.833
So you've got the Os that are
going to do the bridging.

00:51:44.833 --> 00:51:50.733
And now you just do that same
thing you did before, to put a

00:51:50.733 --> 00:51:53.933
carbon in, this carbon the same
way you did that one by

00:51:53.933 --> 00:51:58.833
having a carbon with
two halogens,

00:51:58.833 --> 00:52:00.233
so two leaving groups.

00:52:00.233 --> 00:52:02.567
And now again, when those two
things come together, if you

00:52:02.567 --> 00:52:06.100
have three things that can react
here and three things

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:07.800
that can react here that
can go like that,

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:08.800
which is what you want.

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.433
It could go like that, it could
go like that, it could

00:52:11.433 --> 00:52:12.633
go like that.

00:52:12.633 --> 00:52:15.500
There are lots of
different ways.

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:18.967
But it turned out that
they got 40% of it.

00:52:18.967 --> 00:52:21.367
40% of this stuff
went into that.

00:52:21.367 --> 00:52:25.200
Overall, from the stuff they
started, and it's a 1% yield.

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.067
But they started with
a lot of stuff.

00:52:27.067 --> 00:52:30.167
So they had the clam shell.

00:52:30.167 --> 00:52:33.000
And now it turned out they
could get the guest out.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:37.100
This is a crystal structure,
so this stuff at the top is

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:41.400
chloroform, and this
is solvent.

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.800
There are two different
solvents in there.

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:46.467
But in the middle of
the cage is DMF.

00:52:46.467 --> 00:52:48.500
This is that clam shell here.

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:51.233
And these things are just put on
to make it soluble, so you

00:52:51.233 --> 00:52:52.767
can work with it.

00:52:52.767 --> 00:52:53.033
OK.

00:52:53.033 --> 00:52:55.633
So they could get that stuff
out, and they could

00:52:55.633 --> 00:52:58.367
replace it with this.

00:52:58.367 --> 00:53:02.233
So here's that stuff on the
cover of Angewandte Chemie

00:53:02.233 --> 00:53:04.167
inside that compound.

00:53:04.167 --> 00:53:05.700
And this is the NMR spectrum.

00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:09.933
So most of the peaks come from
these hydrogens in the shell.

00:53:09.933 --> 00:53:13.900
But the ones marked in red, and
one that's under here, are

00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:18.033
these four hydrogens on
the starting material.

00:53:18.033 --> 00:53:21.100
And then they photolyzed it, and
they got the purple peaks.

00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:22.700
It changed.

00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:26.167
And then they photolyzed
it again, and they

00:53:26.167 --> 00:53:28.133
got just one peak.

00:53:28.133 --> 00:53:31.833
That's the peak of
cyclobutadiene.

00:53:31.833 --> 00:53:33.800
And it can't react with any
others, because there are no

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.500
others around.

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:38.300
And then if you get it out
again, then it will react to

00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:40.200
give cyclooctatetraene.

00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:45.833
So this is way upfield,
antiaromatic.

00:53:45.833 --> 00:53:48.767
As we talked about before.

00:53:48.767 --> 00:53:51.267
Now, is that what causes
the upfield shift?

00:53:51.267 --> 00:53:53.500
Because you'll notice
something else.

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:59.633
If you put benzene inside, its
normal position would be here.

00:53:59.633 --> 00:54:03.800
But benzene inside that
clam shell is there.

00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.500
It shifted way upfield.

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.233
Why?

00:54:07.233 --> 00:54:12.100
Because it's above all sorts
of other benzene rings.

00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:14.933
Remember, when you have
something above but a benzene

00:54:14.933 --> 00:54:16.600
ring, it's shifted upfield.

00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:19.167
If it's out beside it, it's
shifted downfield.

00:54:19.167 --> 00:54:21.333
But this, the one that's in
the middle is above all.

00:54:21.333 --> 00:54:24.367
So some of that shift must be
due to the same effect that

00:54:24.367 --> 00:54:26.333
makes benzene go up.

00:54:26.333 --> 00:54:29.333
So most of the shift comes
from the other rings.

00:54:29.333 --> 00:54:32.600
Still, it's about one and 
a half ppb above

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:35.067
benzene, so it is shifted
upfield and it is

00:54:35.067 --> 00:54:36.400
antiaromatic.

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:38.500
So I think that's what
I wanted to show you.

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:40.300
That's the end.

00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:44.800
But the big lesson is how
Fischer did glucose.

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.033
Thanks.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.680
Prof: We are coming to a
part of the Quixote,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.453
the core of Part I,
in which Cervantes makes a

00:00:09.453 --> 00:00:15.287
display of narrative mastery by
combining the sequential

00:00:15.287 --> 00:00:19.530
structure of the chivalric
romance,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.040
whose form he is parodying,
with the multiple story design

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.890
of collections of
novelle,

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:34.517
the long short story favored by
Italians from Boccaccio to

00:00:34.517 --> 00:00:35.990
Bandello.
 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.340
How can these two genres be
merged and mixed?

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.385
Cervantes achieves it by taking
his protagonist away from the

00:00:47.385 --> 00:00:53.430
center of the story while still
engaging him in the unfolding

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.367
and resolution of the
intercalated tales involving

00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:03.119
Cardenio,
Fernando, Dorotea and Luscinda.

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:10.730
We will get to that,
today and in the next class.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.168
But first, I want to begin by
talking about the role that

00:01:16.168 --> 00:01:22.188
memory plays in narrative and
the development of characters.

00:01:22.188 --> 00:01:26.349
In the last class,
we saw how interrupted stories

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:31.723
being told by characters led to
the revelation of other stories

00:01:31.723 --> 00:01:35.450
not being told or being told
obliquely.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.940
In all of those cases,
memory is the key element.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.690
Don Quixote makes up the
generic chivalric novel,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.322
generic chivalric romance
drawing from his recollections

00:01:52.322 --> 00:01:58.160
of the chivalric romances that
he has read in the past.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:05.435
In the episodes in the Sierra
Morena, there are three moments

00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:09.680
when memory plays a crucial
role.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:17.305
The first is when Cardenio
speaks about how painful the

00:02:17.305 --> 00:02:24.930
memory of his betrayal by
Luscinda and Fernando is,

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.373
and how he would like to evoke
it, if only to make him have the

00:02:31.373 --> 00:02:35.220
strength of mind to commit
suicide.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.353
He says on page 225:
"O memory,

00:02:39.353 --> 00:02:43.250
thou mortal enemy of my repose!
 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.430
why dost thou represent to me
now the incomparable beauty of

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.449
that my adored enemy?
 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:52.971
Were it not better,
cruel memory,

00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:57.306
to put me in my mind of,
and represent to my imagination

00:02:57.306 --> 00:03:01.393
what she did then;
that moved by so flagrant

00:03:01.393 --> 00:03:06.852
injury, I may strive since,
I do not revenge it at least to

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:09.770
put an end to my life?"
 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.393
The agonizing recollection of
those events,

00:03:14.393 --> 00:03:19.455
of the betrayal,
constitutes the defining story

00:03:19.455 --> 00:03:24.520
of Cardenio and the source of
his madness.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.307
It is not just what others did
to him, but what he failed to do

00:03:30.307 --> 00:03:33.762
at the decisive moment,
his cowardice,

00:03:33.762 --> 00:03:36.470
as he refers to it twice.
 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.030
He says that he was a coward,
twice.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.849
The second instance when memory
plays a role is when Cardenio

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:50.865
says that he vaguely remembers
the fracas with Don Quixote when

00:03:50.865 --> 00:03:54.940
the knight interrupted his
narrative,

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.550
the episode is like a hole in
his memory.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.306
This is an example of Cervantes
psychological sophistication

00:04:02.306 --> 00:04:07.383
that Cardenio can only remember
the fight with Don Quixote as if

00:04:07.383 --> 00:04:12.526
it had been a dream,
but cannot recall what provoked

00:04:12.526 --> 00:04:12.930
it.
 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.370
And I quote from page 245 in
your translation:

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.120
"Cardenio hereupon
remembered,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.235
as if it had been a dream,
the quarrel he had with Don

00:04:25.235 --> 00:04:28.047
Quixote,
which he related to the

00:04:28.047 --> 00:04:32.642
company, but could not recollect
whence it arose."

00:04:32.642 --> 00:04:33.750
[Unquote].
 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.259
Cardenio's story has a gaping
hole, a crack at the climax that

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.504
is contained within another
crack, Don Quixote's

00:04:43.504 --> 00:04:45.040
interruption.
 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.870
It is like the scar left by a
deep wound.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.889
This lapse is a clear symptom
of trauma, we would say today.

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.355
Cardenio's story is full of
holes, of gaps,

00:04:59.355 --> 00:05:01.170
and discontinuities.
 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:09.139
The third instance when memory
is highlighted is when Dorotea,

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:15.100
as Princess Micomicona,
forgets her name as she plays

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.290
that role when telling the bogus
story of her life,

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:33.350
on page 255--Let's see if I can
find it.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.899
She says...
 

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:40.271
She is about to start her story
and she says:

00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:43.185
"'In the first place,
you must know gentlemen that

00:05:43.185 --> 00:05:44.209
may name is...'
 

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:48.846
Here she stopped short,
having forgot the name the

00:05:48.846 --> 00:05:53.387
priest had given her:
but he presently helped her

00:05:53.387 --> 00:05:56.086
out,
for he knew what she stopped

00:05:56.086 --> 00:05:58.065
at, and said:
'It is no wonder,

00:05:58.065 --> 00:06:00.740
madam...'"
And so forth.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.619
As Dorotea says,
she will make up the story

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:10.528
basing it on her recollection of
reading romances of chivalry.

00:06:10.528 --> 00:06:14.494
This, by the way,
is an inconsistency either in

00:06:14.494 --> 00:06:18.889
Cervantes's case or Dorotea's
own recollections,

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.060
when she told her life,
of how her life was,

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.507
she said that one of her
entertainments was reading

00:06:26.507 --> 00:06:28.370
mostly devout literature.
 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.451
She didn't mention anything
then about reading romances of

00:06:31.451 --> 00:06:33.019
chivalry, but she does now.
 

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:37.093
So she will make up the story
basing it on her recollection of

00:06:37.093 --> 00:06:41.040
reading romances of chivalry,
but the name was not of her

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.720
mention but the priest's,
so she quickly forgets it and

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.009
has to be prompted.
 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:50.019
Since, as we commented,
her story is a translation of

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:54.800
her current predicament into the
discourse of the romances,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.769
her forgetting her name is also
indicative of her traumatized

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:00.350
self.
 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.158
She has, after all,
assumed other roles after she

00:07:04.158 --> 00:07:08.997
was abandoned by Don Fernando,
which is the traumatic event in

00:07:08.997 --> 00:07:10.028
her life.
 

00:07:10.028 --> 00:07:15.177
Her sense of identity is frail
and in the process of being

00:07:15.177 --> 00:07:15.990
remade.
 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:21.846
Now, connected to all of this,
and perhaps the overarching

00:07:21.846 --> 00:07:28.629
memory lapse of them all is the
loss of Sancho's ass or dapple,

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:31.740
as the translation calls
him--there's no name,

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.970
by the way, for the ass in the
Spanish original,

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.182
but I know that in this
translation and the others they

00:07:38.182 --> 00:07:39.779
call him "dapple"
because,

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:45.783
I suppose, of his color--So
remember that this theft of

00:07:45.783 --> 00:07:52.233
Sancho's ass is left out of the
first edition and Cervantes

00:07:52.233 --> 00:07:57.569
hastily restored it in the
second printing,

00:07:57.569 --> 00:07:59.670
a few months later.
 

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:04.326
Memory is not just a repository
of recollections and stories

00:08:04.326 --> 00:08:08.663
from the past,
it is that which structures the

00:08:08.663 --> 00:08:13.245
self in the present,
and the archive whence

00:08:13.245 --> 00:08:19.163
narratives issue flawed and
misshapen no longer a true

00:08:19.163 --> 00:08:25.863
reflection of what happened but
revelatory of a truth about a

00:08:25.863 --> 00:08:31.000
character's state as he or she
talks now.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.621
So it is a truth about now,
about the present that may be

00:08:35.621 --> 00:08:39.336
full of holes,
of misrepresentations about the

00:08:39.336 --> 00:08:40.080
past.
 

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.760
It is nevertheless the
repository of stories about the

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.379
past.
 

00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:50.181
So it is in that interplay
between that flawed recollection

00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:54.072
and the present,
that the stories are told--it's

00:08:54.072 --> 00:08:56.058
what I'm driving at.
 

00:08:56.058 --> 00:09:01.533
The representation of all of
this of this interplay of memory

00:09:01.533 --> 00:09:06.552
and narrative is the overall
network of interrelated and

00:09:06.552 --> 00:09:12.025
intertwined stories that take
place or are told in the Sierra

00:09:12.025 --> 00:09:16.678
Morena and resolved at Juan
Palomeque's inn,

00:09:16.678 --> 00:09:20.580
after Don Quixote's battle of
the wine skins,

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.860
about which we will speak in
the next class.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:30.340
Now, Cervantes was very much
aware of the complexities of

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.450
that construct,
that network of stories.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.970
We read at the beginning of
chapter XXVIII--

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.570
and I have a handout for you to
take home,

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:45.629
which is the text that I'm
going to read in Spanish,

00:09:45.629 --> 00:09:54.602
and on the back of it,
various excellent translations

00:09:54.602 --> 00:09:59.779
of it that I have collected.
 

00:09:59.779 --> 00:10:09.816
You can follow the Spanish on
the Spanish side of the handout,

00:10:09.816 --> 00:10:15.408
and it says "No
solo."

00:10:15.408 --> 00:10:21.604
This is, we read at the
beginning of chapter XXVIII

00:10:21.604 --> 00:10:28.788
after we have heard Cardenio's
tale in two installments.

00:10:28.788 --> 00:10:33.340
We have this remarkable
self-referential mock admonition

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:38.221
on the part of the narrator:
"No sólo la dulzura

00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:41.145
de su [es decir,
la de Don Quixote]

00:10:41.145 --> 00:10:44.979
verdadera historia,
sino de los cuentos y episodios

00:10:44.979 --> 00:10:47.551
de ella,
que en parte no son menos

00:10:47.551 --> 00:10:51.113
agradables y artificiosos y
verdaderos que la misma

00:10:51.113 --> 00:10:54.034
historia,
la cual prosiguiendo su

00:10:54.034 --> 00:10:56.528
rastrillado,
torcido y aspado hilo,

00:10:56.528 --> 00:10:59.260
cuenta que así
como el cura empezó

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.538
a prevenirse."
 

00:11:00.538 --> 00:11:03.995
Now this is,
I regret to say,

00:11:03.995 --> 00:11:07.010
Jarvis,
the translation that we are

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.446
using this year,
pairs this down to,

00:11:09.446 --> 00:11:13.053
quote: "Enjoy the sweets
of his [Don Quixote's true

00:11:13.053 --> 00:11:15.022
story]
but also the stories and

00:11:15.022 --> 00:11:19.220
episodes of it which are in some
sort no less pleasing artificial

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.908
and true than the history
itself,

00:11:21.908 --> 00:11:25.538
which resuming the broken
thread of the narration relates

00:11:25.538 --> 00:11:26.509
that..."
 

00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:28.580
You can see he's pared it down.
 

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:34.908
Tobias Smollett's version with
some emendations of my own--

00:11:34.908 --> 00:11:37.710
you'll have it on the back,
you'll read under Smollett,

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:44.370
which is the last one:
"In this our age,

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.629
in so much in need of enjoying
agreeable entertainments,

00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:51.570
not only of his [Don Quixote's]
true and delightful adventures,

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.639
but also of the intervening
episodes,

00:11:53.639 --> 00:11:56.730
which are no less real,
artful and delicious than the

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.701
main story itself,
the twisted reeled and rattled

00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:03.970
thread of which is continued
thus,

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.792
just as the curate was ready to
offer some consolation to

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:07.750
Cardenio..."
 

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.139
And so forth and so on.
 

00:12:09.139 --> 00:12:14.480
You can see how much Jarvis
left out.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.019
I want to call attention not
just to what the text says,

00:12:18.019 --> 00:12:22.702
but to the interruption itself,
which is a speech act that

00:12:22.702 --> 00:12:27.470
performs the function of
interrupting in this narrative.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:32.985
A speech act is an act that a
speaker performs when making an

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:34.090
utterance.
 

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:39.570
Just as the priest is about to
reply to Cardenio he is

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:45.529
prevented in Smollett's version,
hindered in Jarvis's version by

00:12:45.529 --> 00:12:48.923
Dorotea's voice,
which will provide part of the

00:12:48.923 --> 00:12:51.840
missing information in
Cardenio's account.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.668
There can be no comforting of
Cardenio yet.

00:12:55.668 --> 00:12:59.740
Interruptions rarely promote
comforting.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:05.125
The words Cervantes used to
refer to the build up or

00:13:05.125 --> 00:13:10.509
spooling up of narrative trends,
brings this out.

00:13:10.509 --> 00:13:13.840
They are drawn from spinning
linen thread,

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.509
"rastrillado,
torcido y aspado"

00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:21.416
and are reasonably well
translated by Smollett's as

00:13:21.416 --> 00:13:24.509
"twisted,
reeled and raveled,"

00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:27.269
but in the original they have,
at least for me,

00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:29.370
perhaps because Spanish is my
native language,

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.639
a more violent or literal
inflection.

00:13:32.639 --> 00:13:35.453
In other words,
"twisted,"

00:13:35.453 --> 00:13:38.750
"reeled"
and "raveled"

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:44.139
are common English terms whose
metaphoric origin has now faded.

00:13:44.139 --> 00:13:48.919
In Spanish, the words used by
Cervantes applied allegorically

00:13:48.919 --> 00:13:53.381
to narrative are shockingly
fresh and evoke more directly

00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:56.490
the physical actions they
describe.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:01.645
'Rastrillar' is to rake
out the excess fibers from the

00:14:01.645 --> 00:14:04.212
thread;
'torcer' is to twist

00:14:04.212 --> 00:14:08.200
together many strands in order
to make a string or thread,

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.278
and 'aspar' is to twist
two sticks to weave together,

00:14:12.278 --> 00:14:16.053
to weave strings together,
as is done on a smaller scale

00:14:16.053 --> 00:14:19.831
with the needles in knitting,
when you go like this with the

00:14:19.831 --> 00:14:22.340
two needles,
so the two sticks are being

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.389
aspando.
 

00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:30.100
The cross marriages,
Luscinda with Cardenio--

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.960
although she had been married
to Don Fernando,

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.174
and Dorotea to Don
Fernando--although she had been

00:14:34.174 --> 00:14:37.739
in Cardenio's care,
replicate the positioning and

00:14:37.739 --> 00:14:42.080
action of the two sticks used
for aspar,

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.168
if you understand what I mean.
 

00:14:44.168 --> 00:14:49.033
In short, the relation among
the stories, including the main

00:14:49.033 --> 00:14:53.155
plot is predicated on blunt cuts
and crisscrossing,

00:14:53.155 --> 00:14:55.629
not on smooth transitions.
 

00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:59.960
These are made possible by
traumatic interruptions,

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.471
which jostle the memory of the
tellers and drive them to reveal

00:15:04.471 --> 00:15:07.528
other stories behind the one
they tell,

00:15:07.528 --> 00:15:12.136
and also make them disclose
their inner thoughts rounding

00:15:12.136 --> 00:15:14.028
out their characters.
 

00:15:14.028 --> 00:15:18.470
But, in addition,
the whole network of stories,

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:22.636
which is like a quilt--to
continue this metaphor having to

00:15:22.636 --> 00:15:27.125
do with cloth--
is itself a superb display of

00:15:27.125 --> 00:15:33.187
narrative skill and of variety,
which is one of the aims of

00:15:33.187 --> 00:15:34.678
Renaissance art.
 

00:15:34.678 --> 00:15:38.220
But the question will always
remain,

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.259
in spite of what the narrator
says,

00:15:40.259 --> 00:15:44.206
about the relationship of all
of these stories to the main

00:15:44.206 --> 00:15:46.558
story of Don Quixote and Sancho.
 

00:15:46.558 --> 00:15:48.928
I'm sketching an answer here
today,

00:15:48.928 --> 00:15:52.264
but I must inform you,
and as you will learn in the

00:15:52.264 --> 00:15:55.910
prologue of Part II,
Cervantes was criticized for

00:15:55.910 --> 00:16:00.788
including all of these stories,
and in the sequel he was

00:16:00.788 --> 00:16:06.465
careful to integrate stories
more seamlessly into the main

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:07.759
narrative.
 

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:12.027
He didn't include a story like
The Novel of the Curious

00:16:12.027 --> 00:16:15.000
Impertinent,
about which we will be speaking

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.706
in the next class,
whose relationship to the main

00:16:19.706 --> 00:16:24.278
story is debatable or
questionable,

00:16:24.278 --> 00:16:28.548
and we will talk about it in
the next class.

00:16:28.548 --> 00:16:32.909
Now, in the last class I
focused--we will talk about it

00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:36.139
in the next class,
did I say the last?

00:16:36.139 --> 00:16:37.590
In the next class.
 

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:40.320
In the last class I focused on
Don Fernando--

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.638
remember when I talked about
the mayorazgo and the

00:16:42.638 --> 00:16:44.750
segundón and that
whole background.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:49.100
Let us concentrate today on
Dorotea and Cardenio;

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.668
Cardenio.
 

00:16:52.668 --> 00:16:56.004
Edward Dudley,
who's name I put there in case

00:16:56.004 --> 00:16:59.881
I don't make it clear,
writes in his superb essay

00:16:59.881 --> 00:17:02.703
"The Wild Man Goes
Baroque,"

00:17:02.703 --> 00:17:06.949
he writes the following--
I'm going to be glossing some

00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:10.513
quotes from Dudley's essay:
"This wild man is

00:17:10.513 --> 00:17:12.394
Cardenio,
the soul brother of Don

00:17:12.394 --> 00:17:14.598
Quixote, and like him,
a victim of madness.

00:17:14.598 --> 00:17:18.508
Their meeting in the Sierra
Morena occurs in an atmosphere

00:17:18.508 --> 00:17:21.669
of unspoken attractions,
and Don Quixote,

00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:24.778
already mad,
is driven farther into the

00:17:24.778 --> 00:17:27.970
shadowed wilderness of his
insanity.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:33.075
His subsequent imitation of
Cardenio's madness is the high

00:17:33.075 --> 00:17:35.404
point of his lunacy."
 

00:17:35.404 --> 00:17:36.390
Unquote.
 

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:40.208
Dudley is referring to the
episode that I quoted earlier

00:17:40.208 --> 00:17:43.608
about the meeting of Cardenio
and Don Quixote,

00:17:43.608 --> 00:17:46.780
when the knight seems to
remember having seen Cardenio

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:47.380
earlier.
 

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:52.848
Now, the difference between the
two is that Cardenio is a poet,

00:17:52.848 --> 00:17:56.377
in the Petrarchan vain or
Garcilaso vain,

00:17:56.377 --> 00:17:58.759
like Grisóstomo.
 

00:17:58.759 --> 00:18:03.005
So there are parallelisms with
Don Quixote, but there are also

00:18:03.005 --> 00:18:03.980
differences.
 

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:08.412
Dudley goes on to give a
context to the figure of the

00:18:08.412 --> 00:18:09.348
wild man.
 

00:18:09.348 --> 00:18:12.419
He says: "The approach to
a wild man hidden in a

00:18:12.419 --> 00:18:15.430
threatening wilderness is an
archetypal pattern,

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:19.895
familiar in world folklore and
one utilized by artists again

00:18:19.895 --> 00:18:21.106
and again."
 

00:18:21.106 --> 00:18:21.940
Unquote.
 

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.892
He even alludes to a modern
work like Joseph Conrad's

00:18:24.892 --> 00:18:27.388
Heart of Darkness,
which, as you know,

00:18:27.388 --> 00:18:29.318
is from 1900 the famous novel.
 

00:18:29.318 --> 00:18:33.593
So the story of finding a wild
man in the wilderness is

00:18:33.593 --> 00:18:36.598
something that is a folkloric
story.

00:18:36.598 --> 00:18:40.961
Dudley cites he-goats and
wolves as akin to Cardenio in

00:18:40.961 --> 00:18:42.980
his moments of madness.
 

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:50.595
I mean, these figures assume
the role of he-goats and of

00:18:50.595 --> 00:18:53.836
wolves,
two images that suggest

00:18:53.836 --> 00:18:58.761
respectively the problems of sex
and violence that haunted the

00:18:58.761 --> 00:19:02.498
seventeenth century;
I would say that haunted all

00:19:02.498 --> 00:19:05.584
centuries, but I mean,
he knows, because he has

00:19:05.584 --> 00:19:08.670
studied stories in the
seventeenth century.

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.152
Dudley claims that,
quote: "Cardenio's problem

00:19:11.152 --> 00:19:13.038
is that he cannot talk
effectively,

00:19:13.038 --> 00:19:16.913
that he cannot communicate by
means of the spoken word."

00:19:16.913 --> 00:19:17.558
Unquote.
 

00:19:17.558 --> 00:19:20.161
And adds that:
"clinically Cardenio's

00:19:20.161 --> 00:19:24.160
conditioned has been diagnosed
as a case of zoanthropy."

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.058
Zoanthropy, animal-man,
man becoming like an animal.

00:19:28.058 --> 00:19:34.192
As for the relationship between
Don Fernando and Cardenio,

00:19:34.192 --> 00:19:37.960
Dudley sees a homosexual
pattern.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.442
He suggests that the
relationship between Cardenio

00:19:42.442 --> 00:19:46.470
and Fernando shows some mutual
affection,

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:51.955
that in a way anticipate the
relationship between the two

00:19:51.955 --> 00:19:58.128
protagonists of The Novel of
the Curious Impertinent that

00:19:58.128 --> 00:20:02.440
we will be discussing in the
next class.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.566
That is, that the relationship
between these two men is

00:20:06.566 --> 00:20:09.592
mediated by Luscinda,
but that actually,

00:20:09.592 --> 00:20:13.368
it is a homosexual relationship
between the two of them.

00:20:13.368 --> 00:20:19.038
More inline with what I have
been saying about interruptions,

00:20:19.038 --> 00:20:22.220
Dudley says that in asking
Cardenio to tell his story,

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.316
quote: "Don Quixote
anticipates the twentieth

00:20:25.316 --> 00:20:29.172
century analyst who begins the
cure by having the patient tell

00:20:29.172 --> 00:20:31.940
his story,
and it is in the story that the

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.790
cause of the madness is found,
just as it is by means of Don

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:39.259
Quixote's intervention that the
cure is initiated.

00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:43.836
But as he proceeds,
it becomes apparent that the

00:20:43.836 --> 00:20:48.509
real reason is that he is
autistic and wants,

00:20:48.509 --> 00:20:51.298
above all, not to be challenged
in his dubious interpretation of

00:20:51.298 --> 00:20:52.140
the events."
 

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.047
I will say that it's not that
he's autistic but that he has

00:20:55.047 --> 00:20:58.448
been traumatized,
and that trauma has caused

00:20:58.448 --> 00:21:02.358
something akin to autism,
but it is not autism.

00:21:02.358 --> 00:21:05.481
And then he says that:
"Dorotea plays an

00:21:05.481 --> 00:21:09.142
important role,
because Dorotea appears before

00:21:09.142 --> 00:21:12.078
Cardenio and he admires her
beauty,

00:21:12.078 --> 00:21:16.566
but does not lust after her,
and that in that process

00:21:16.566 --> 00:21:19.500
Cardenio's cure has begun."
 

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:24.798
And this is a typically
Renaissance idea of a cure

00:21:24.798 --> 00:21:29.338
provoked by the contemplation of
beauty.

00:21:29.338 --> 00:21:37.088
This is the role that Dorotea
plays in the cure of Cardenio.

00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:43.008
Cardenio's character flaws and
his intermittent bouts of

00:21:43.008 --> 00:21:49.571
madness are perhaps the reasons
why Shakespeare found Cardenio

00:21:49.571 --> 00:21:54.200
compelling and wrote a play
about him,

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:59.490
a play that was lost,
by the way.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:03.000
It is known that Shakespeare
wrote a play based on Cardenio.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.278
Remember, the Quixote
appeared in translation in 1611,

00:22:06.278 --> 00:22:09.220
so Shakespeare had time,
and he did,

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.098
to read Don Quixote,
and to read the story,

00:22:11.098 --> 00:22:16.818
and to write a play based on
this character.

00:22:16.818 --> 00:22:19.181
Unfortunately,
it was lost,

00:22:19.181 --> 00:22:23.813
but one is left to wonder,
what did Shakespeare find

00:22:23.813 --> 00:22:27.808
compelling in the character of
Cardenio?

00:22:27.808 --> 00:22:31.869
I would say,
of course, there is a

00:22:31.869 --> 00:22:38.021
Hamlet-like tendency to
hesitation in Cardenio that

00:22:38.021 --> 00:22:43.190
Shakespeare may have found
attractive.

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:49.948
Of course--could you close that
window so that we don't hear the

00:22:49.948 --> 00:22:55.420
gentlemen outside laughing at
each other's jokes?

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:59.372
You can also yell out and tell
them to shut up,

00:22:59.372 --> 00:23:00.059
but...
 

00:23:00.059 --> 00:23:02.480
No.
 

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.000
I think this is pretty good.
 

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:12.192
So one interesting topic for a
paper would be to speculate why

00:23:12.192 --> 00:23:20.115
Shakespeare wrote a play on
Cardenio along the lines of what

00:23:20.115 --> 00:23:24.647
I have suggested,
here but you can come up with

00:23:24.647 --> 00:23:25.519
your own ideas.
 

00:23:25.519 --> 00:23:28.528
And, in fact,
a professor from Harvard,

00:23:28.528 --> 00:23:33.088
Stephen Greenblatt,
I read in the paper,

00:23:33.088 --> 00:23:35.834
not long ago,
actually, he being an expert on

00:23:35.834 --> 00:23:41.480
Shakespeare,
wrote a play based on Cardenio.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:46.450
Literature professors are often
tempted to cross the line and to

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:47.950
write literature.
 

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:51.548
The results are not always very
felicitous.

00:23:51.548 --> 00:23:56.420
But I haven't seen Greenblatt's
play, so I'm not judging it.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:00.380
Now, Dorotea's story.
 

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:05.136
As we know and saw in the last
class, Dorotea is seduced by

00:24:05.136 --> 00:24:08.500
Fernando, who instead marries
Luscinda.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.170
Is there some kind of
culpability in Dorotea?

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:15.869
Did she not also consider at
the crucial moment what a good

00:24:15.869 --> 00:24:17.528
match Fernando would be?
 

00:24:17.528 --> 00:24:20.509
Wasn't she trapped by the fact
that if she resisted,

00:24:20.509 --> 00:24:24.013
no one would believe that she
had not allowed Fernando in her

00:24:24.013 --> 00:24:24.538
room?
 

00:24:24.538 --> 00:24:28.118
Like Cardenio,
she hesitates at the moment of

00:24:28.118 --> 00:24:32.674
truth, but unlike Cardenio she
makes a decision and takes

00:24:32.674 --> 00:24:33.568
action.
 

00:24:33.568 --> 00:24:37.990
Hers is not a submissive
surrender.

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:40.298
It is a calculated surrender.
 

00:24:40.298 --> 00:24:46.170
When Fernando disappears she
goes in search of him,

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:50.713
but then discovers that the
marriage to Luscinda may not be

00:24:50.713 --> 00:24:53.449
final,
and that she may have a chance

00:24:53.449 --> 00:24:56.288
to force him to make good on his
promise.

00:24:56.288 --> 00:25:00.653
Remember that Fernando,
she discovers,

00:25:00.653 --> 00:25:08.086
has been going hunting after he
left her completely oblivious to

00:25:08.086 --> 00:25:09.028
her.
 

00:25:09.028 --> 00:25:12.814
Cardenio, on the other hand,
is pusillanimous,

00:25:12.814 --> 00:25:17.861
cowardly, and Luscinda cannot
bring herself to suicide at the

00:25:17.861 --> 00:25:21.308
crucial moment as she intended
to do.

00:25:21.308 --> 00:25:24.920
Dorotea, on the other hand,
is not passive.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.115
She invents herself like Don
Quixote and like him raises

00:25:29.115 --> 00:25:33.005
herself in social class,
ultimately because she does

00:25:33.005 --> 00:25:34.759
marry Don Fernando.
 

00:25:34.759 --> 00:25:39.885
We will soon see the role she
plays in bringing a resolution

00:25:39.885 --> 00:25:45.358
to the conflicts and prepare the
way for Don Quixote's return to

00:25:45.358 --> 00:25:46.750
his village.
 

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:51.510
Now, Dorotea's story is as
compelling as Cardenio's,

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:56.925
but she is more composed and
determined to obtain some sort

00:25:56.925 --> 00:25:58.700
of restitution.
 

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:02.897
Her situation is complicated by
the fact that her father is Don

00:26:02.897 --> 00:26:06.622
Fernando's vassal,
and she could hardly be the one

00:26:06.622 --> 00:26:10.558
to seek revenge or compensation
according to custom.

00:26:10.558 --> 00:26:16.548
But by law, she had recourse to
both, to revenge and

00:26:16.548 --> 00:26:21.599
compensation,
but usually with the help of a

00:26:21.599 --> 00:26:22.538
man.
 

00:26:22.538 --> 00:26:26.788
Legislation in the wake of the
Catholic kings program to reign

00:26:26.788 --> 00:26:30.549
in the aristocracy made it a
crime for noblemen to take

00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:32.710
advantage of peasant women.
 

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:37.440
Cardenio, being a man and an
aristocrat, like Don Fernando

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.759
and the Duke,
offers to stand up for her,

00:26:40.759 --> 00:26:44.660
clearly because it is also in
his interest.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:50.358
He makes the promise in strict
accordance to law and custom.

00:26:50.358 --> 00:26:55.827
He says that he will challenge
Fernando to a dual using the

00:26:55.827 --> 00:27:01.388
word "riepto,"
which is an old Spanish word

00:27:01.388 --> 00:27:06.856
for "retar,"
and which was part of Spanish

00:27:06.856 --> 00:27:13.500
legislation in the Middle Ages,
but that had been banned by

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:17.808
legislation in the sixteenth
century.

00:27:17.808 --> 00:27:22.141
That is, by the sixteenth
century noblemen were not

00:27:22.141 --> 00:27:26.298
allowed to duel with each other
over an issue.

00:27:26.298 --> 00:27:28.967
But there was a lot of debate
because, of course,

00:27:28.967 --> 00:27:31.578
the aristocracy wanted to
retain that right,

00:27:31.578 --> 00:27:38.795
which went back to Visigothic
times when noblemen took care of

00:27:38.795 --> 00:27:43.288
these issues by fighting each
other.

00:27:43.288 --> 00:27:50.470
Now, that he's reassured of
Luscinda's virginal condition--

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:53.603
and this is crucial--and the
questionable legality of her

00:27:53.603 --> 00:27:57.670
marriage to Don Fernando,
Cardenio is encouraged to take

00:27:57.670 --> 00:28:01.396
action,
and he invokes what he believes

00:28:01.396 --> 00:28:03.028
to be his right.
 

00:28:03.028 --> 00:28:08.808
Dorotea's story is briefly
interrupted by Cardenio,

00:28:08.808 --> 00:28:12.026
who cannot refrain from saying
something when he hears about

00:28:12.026 --> 00:28:14.480
his own misfortunes from her
point of view.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.583
This is the rest of his own
story, which he himself did not

00:28:18.583 --> 00:28:20.750
know,
and when he reveals to Dorotea

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:23.932
his identity,
parts of her story that she did

00:28:23.932 --> 00:28:25.930
not know fall into place.
 

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:31.506
The interruptions are like the
scenes between the pieces of a

00:28:31.506 --> 00:28:32.900
large puzzle.
 

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.613
For Cardenio,
the crucial piece is the scene

00:28:35.613 --> 00:28:38.578
of the wedding of Luscinda and
Don Fernando,

00:28:38.578 --> 00:28:42.269
which had appeared
proleptically in the chivalric

00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:46.275
story that he blurted out,
when Don Quixote interrupted

00:28:46.275 --> 00:28:50.077
him, the business about Queen
Madasima and the surgeon having

00:28:50.077 --> 00:28:53.851
had an affair--
remember that psychotic version

00:28:53.851 --> 00:28:58.858
that he had in his mind about
the deflowering of Luscinda.

00:28:58.858 --> 00:29:03.461
But now, he and Dorotea begin
to discern a potential happy

00:29:03.461 --> 00:29:07.900
ending to their misfortunes at
the intersection of their

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.922
stories,
when they hear each other's

00:29:10.922 --> 00:29:11.578
stories.
 

00:29:11.578 --> 00:29:15.119
The deleted motive,
the gap in the story concerns

00:29:15.119 --> 00:29:19.324
the legality of Fernando's and
Luscinda's marriage and her

00:29:19.324 --> 00:29:21.390
retaining her virginity.
 

00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:24.671
It is that chasm,
fraught with violence and

00:29:24.671 --> 00:29:29.480
erased from Cardenio's memory,
that needs to be filled in the

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:33.868
melodramatic and conclusive
scene at Juan Palomeque's inn.

00:29:33.868 --> 00:29:38.115
Cardenio expresses his desire
for restitution using legal

00:29:38.115 --> 00:29:42.740
terms to describe the damage
inflicted on him and Luscinda.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.327
On page 245,
it says: "There is still

00:29:46.327 --> 00:29:51.665
room for us to hope that heaven
will restore to each of us our

00:29:51.665 --> 00:29:55.342
own since it is not yet
alienated, nor past

00:29:55.342 --> 00:29:57.180
recovery."
 

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:58.548
These are crucial words.
 

00:29:58.548 --> 00:30:01.973
The original reads:
"Bien podemos esperar

00:30:01.973 --> 00:30:05.400
que el cielo nos restituya lo
que es nuestro,

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.227
pues está
todavía en su ser y no

00:30:08.227 --> 00:30:10.740
se ha enajenado ni
deshecho."

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:14.530
The last part is a notarial
formula used in contracts

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:18.468
involving the assessment of
properties and their resale

00:30:18.468 --> 00:30:20.832
value,
when returned to the original

00:30:20.832 --> 00:30:21.210
owner.
 

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:23.568
I think, too,
that "todavía

00:30:23.568 --> 00:30:26.675
está en su ser"
it remains whole in its

00:30:26.675 --> 00:30:29.586
integrity,
is a euphemism to say that

00:30:29.586 --> 00:30:32.353
Luscinda is still a virgin,
as does

00:30:32.353 --> 00:30:34.910
"deshecho,"
undone.

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:37.858
This invocation of heaven means
that,

00:30:37.858 --> 00:30:40.230
once rescued from the
wilderness, the law,

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:43.428
both human and divine will
again take effect and their

00:30:43.428 --> 00:30:47.558
story will have a happy ending,
once they have left that wild

00:30:47.558 --> 00:30:52.632
place of the Sierra Morena,
law will again take effect,

00:30:52.632 --> 00:30:55.068
human and divine law.
 

00:30:55.068 --> 00:31:00.378
Now, Dorotea is ogled in one of
the most explicitly and

00:31:00.378 --> 00:31:06.278
sophisticated erotic scenes in
the Quixote that I hope

00:31:06.278 --> 00:31:07.950
you remember.
 

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:11.640
Like Cardenio,
Dorotea is first a voice,

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.804
heard by the barber,
the priest and Cardenio,

00:31:15.804 --> 00:31:18.170
who laments her fate.
 

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:25.000
She is sound before she's a
visible body and she will become

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.358
a very visible body indeed.
 

00:31:28.358 --> 00:31:32.454
Sancho, remember,
has left to fetch Don Quixote

00:31:32.454 --> 00:31:35.789
and Cardenio,
the priest and the barber,

00:31:35.789 --> 00:31:39.390
discover the beautiful Dorotea
in a shady spot,

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:41.950
washing her feet in a brook.
 

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:46.784
She's disguised as a farm hand,
but soon, by spreading her

00:31:46.784 --> 00:31:51.023
gorgeous blonde hair,
she reveals herself as a very

00:31:51.023 --> 00:31:53.230
beautiful young woman.
 

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:57.680
Her beautiful,
harmonious body is seen in

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:03.798
stages by the men who spy on her
without being seen--

00:32:03.798 --> 00:32:08.289
the pleasure of voyeurism,
is not just seeing,

00:32:08.289 --> 00:32:09.838
but not being seen.
 

00:32:09.838 --> 00:32:18.856
Dorotea is the object of
converging gazes that possess

00:32:18.856 --> 00:32:24.324
her by parts;
first, and insistently and

00:32:24.324 --> 00:32:28.693
fetishistically,
her feet--You have all,

00:32:28.693 --> 00:32:35.980
I'm sure, even in your youthful
age heard about foot fetishes.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:39.410
When I was a graduate student
here at Yale,

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:42.078
there was a foot kisser in the
library,

00:32:42.078 --> 00:32:47.632
a guy who, if a woman was
sitting at one of these desks

00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:52.153
that have a front like this,
but nothing underneath,

00:32:52.153 --> 00:32:54.529
he would come up and take her
shoe off,

00:32:54.529 --> 00:32:56.140
kiss her foot, and run away.
 

00:32:56.140 --> 00:33:01.878
And I don't know if he was ever
caught, but there was a warning

00:33:01.878 --> 00:33:06.598
about a foot kisser in Sterling
Memorial Library.

00:33:06.598 --> 00:33:11.606
I tell you these stories so
that you remember about

00:33:11.606 --> 00:33:17.414
Dorotea's feet--Their desiring
gazes cut the body in parts,

00:33:17.414 --> 00:33:20.618
a violent act of possession.
 

00:33:20.618 --> 00:33:24.031
Dorotea, who,
as an ensemble embodies perfect

00:33:24.031 --> 00:33:28.528
beauty, is consumed by the men
looking at her in pieces.

00:33:28.528 --> 00:33:33.568
She is a version of Diana in
Greek mythology and of Susanna

00:33:33.568 --> 00:33:38.000
in the Book of Daniel,
women who were observed naked

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
by voyeuristic men.
 

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.376
In Roman mythology,
Diana was the goddess of the

00:33:43.376 --> 00:33:47.904
hunt being associated with wild
animals and woodland and also of

00:33:47.904 --> 00:33:48.838
the moon.
 

00:33:48.838 --> 00:33:55.318
Along her main attributes Diana
was an emblem of chastity.

00:33:55.318 --> 00:33:58.598
Oak groves were especially
sacred to her.

00:33:58.598 --> 00:34:03.368
If her figure in art appears
accompanied by a deer--

00:34:03.368 --> 00:34:06.130
this is because Diana was the
patroness of hunting--

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:10.635
the deer may also offer a
covert reference to the myth of

00:34:10.635 --> 00:34:11.360
Acteon.
 

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:15.539
Acteon, who saw her bathing
naked.

00:34:15.539 --> 00:34:21.708
Diana transformed Acteon into a
stag, and set his own hunting

00:34:21.708 --> 00:34:24.280
dogs to tear him apart.
 

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:29.251
Susanna or Shoshana,
Lily, is one of the additions

00:34:29.251 --> 00:34:35.036
to the book of Daniel accepted
by the Catholic and Eastern

00:34:35.036 --> 00:34:37.268
Orthodox churches.
 

00:34:37.268 --> 00:34:40.449
As the story goes,
a beautiful Hebrew wife is

00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:43.268
falsely accused by lecherous
voyeurs.

00:34:43.268 --> 00:34:48.505
As she bathes in her garden,
having sent her attendants

00:34:48.505 --> 00:34:54.420
away, two lusty elders secretly
observe the lovely Susanna.

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:56.110
When she makes her way back to
her house,

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:59.103
they accost her,
threatening to claim that she

00:34:59.103 --> 00:35:01.829
was meeting a young man in the
garden,

00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:05.719
unless she agrees to have sex
with them.

00:35:05.719 --> 00:35:09.905
She refuses to be blackmailed,
and is arrested and about to be

00:35:09.905 --> 00:35:13.268
put to death for promiscuity
when a young man,

00:35:13.268 --> 00:35:17.244
named Daniel,
interrupts the proceedings and

00:35:17.244 --> 00:35:23.068
he finally gets the two old men
to contradict each other when he

00:35:23.068 --> 00:35:28.445
cross examines them,
and they are executed,

00:35:28.445 --> 00:35:31.789
and so virtue triumphs.
 

00:35:31.789 --> 00:35:38.670
But the crucial image here is
that of Susanna being observed,

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:44.405
ogled by the two men,
the two old men and of Acteon

00:35:44.405 --> 00:35:48.420
looking at Diana naked bathing.
 

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:58.313
So this is what is behind this
beautiful scene that I point you

00:35:58.313 --> 00:36:04.219
to in page 231 of your
translation.

00:36:04.219 --> 00:36:10.583
It is too long for me to read
completely, but just remember

00:36:10.583 --> 00:36:16.400
that these are Cardenio,
the priest and the barber;

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.590
Sancho is not with them.
 

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:19.159
The three men are looking at
her and:

00:36:19.159 --> 00:36:26.570
"They drew near so
silently that he [remember they

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:31.650
think it's a he]
did not hear them;

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:34.480
nor was he intent upon anything
but washing his feet,

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.931
which were such,
that they seemed to be two

00:36:36.931 --> 00:36:40.436
pieces of pure crystal growing
among the other pebbles of the

00:36:40.436 --> 00:36:41.018
brook.
 

00:36:41.018 --> 00:36:44.806
They stood in admiration of the
whiteness and beauty of the

00:36:44.806 --> 00:36:48.264
feet,
which did not seem to them to

00:36:48.264 --> 00:36:52.733
be made for breaking clods,
or following the plough,

00:36:52.733 --> 00:36:56.442
as their owner's dress might
have persuaded them they were:

00:36:56.442 --> 00:36:59.000
and finding they were not
perceived,

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.909
the priest, who went foremost,
made signs to the other two,

00:37:01.909 --> 00:37:04.567
to crouch low,
or hide themselves behind some

00:37:04.567 --> 00:37:07.949
of the rocks thereabouts:
which they accordingly did,

00:37:07.949 --> 00:37:11.619
and stood observing attentively
what the youth was doing."

00:37:11.619 --> 00:37:19.260
And then it goes on to describe
how Dorotea washes her feet,

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:21.559
how her hands are beautifully
white,

00:37:21.559 --> 00:37:28.994
and her hair cascades down to
the point that it makes Apollo

00:37:28.994 --> 00:37:32.530
envious,
as I'm going to say in a minute.

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:38.556
Eventually, they discover to
her who they are,

00:37:38.556 --> 00:37:41.369
and a scene ensues.
 

00:37:41.369 --> 00:37:49.219
This is a scene that could be a
Renaissance painting.

00:37:49.219 --> 00:37:52.681
And, in fact,
Cervantes was well acquainted

00:37:52.681 --> 00:37:55.730
with Italian Renaissance
painting,

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:58.206
for as you know,
having read in the

00:37:58.206 --> 00:38:02.735
Casebook,
Cervantes spent a good deal of

00:38:02.735 --> 00:38:04.309
time in Italy.
 

00:38:04.309 --> 00:38:09.253
And Professor Frederick de
Armas, at the University of

00:38:09.253 --> 00:38:12.880
Chicago,
has written two books about the

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:16.909
impression that Italian art made
on Cervantes,

00:38:16.909 --> 00:38:22.829
and the imprint that these
impressions left in this work,

00:38:22.829 --> 00:38:24.518
and this is obviously one of
those.

00:38:24.518 --> 00:38:29.739
Why is Dorotea a version of the
classical and biblical myth?

00:38:29.739 --> 00:38:33.884
It is a Renaissance move,
as it were, on the part of

00:38:33.884 --> 00:38:34.860
Cervantes.
 

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:39.244
This background enhances the
figure, it enhances the figure

00:38:39.244 --> 00:38:42.800
to have her be a version of a
classical myth.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:47.239
It adds to her beauty,
and to the prestige of the

00:38:47.239 --> 00:38:52.268
creation,
and also it shows that art can

00:38:52.268 --> 00:38:56.583
make the present,
or a present scene,

00:38:56.583 --> 00:39:02.851
be like a classical myth--
This is crucial to understand

00:39:02.851 --> 00:39:10.300
why the scene is so much like
those Renaissance paintings.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:16.673
Dorotea's beauty shines through
her course and cross gendering

00:39:16.673 --> 00:39:17.510
dress.
 

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:20.550
In fact, it is enhanced by it,
the contrast,

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:26.030
the misled anticipation--you
begin to see what you think is a

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:29.536
male and suddenly,
as the person disrobes,

00:39:29.536 --> 00:39:32.018
it begins to show female
features,

00:39:32.018 --> 00:39:35.590
and the gradual revelation of
body parts.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:43.943
These are all very erotic
moves, gradual revelation of the

00:39:43.943 --> 00:39:44.969
body.
 

00:39:44.969 --> 00:39:47.404
Transvestitism is rampant in
the Sierra Morena,

00:39:47.404 --> 00:39:48.780
as you may have noticed.
 

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:51.550
First, the priest dresses as a
princess;

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:55.224
then, the barber puts on the
dress, when the priest becomes a

00:39:55.224 --> 00:39:56.389
little squeamish.
 

00:39:56.389 --> 00:40:00.820
Here, we have characters in
drag, ogling characters in drag.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:04.315
The barber dressed as a woman
looks upon the beautiful Dorotea

00:40:04.315 --> 00:40:05.920
who is dressed like a man.
 

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.630
What does it all mean?
 

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:13.349
It suggests that in the
disordered world of the woods

00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:18.960
this sexuality is so primal that
it antecedes gender

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.829
distinctions.
 

00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:22.869
It is a form so generalized
desire.

00:40:22.869 --> 00:40:28.670
Transvestitism thus is rampant
in the Sierra Morena.

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:34.018
When the priest addresses
Dorotea, later,

00:40:34.018 --> 00:40:37.885
he simply tells her that she
can claim to be whatever she

00:40:37.885 --> 00:40:41.224
wants to be man or woman,
meaning that she can use

00:40:41.224 --> 00:40:43.860
feminine or masculine endings
and pronouns,

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:47.262
as Spanish allows for gender
distinction in the speaker:

00:40:47.262 --> 00:40:49.577
"Dear Madam,
or Dear Sir,

00:40:49.577 --> 00:40:54.154
or whatever you please to
be." This is what the

00:40:54.154 --> 00:40:55.949
translation says.
 

00:40:55.949 --> 00:41:00.871
That is, the despoblado,
this area in the wilderness is

00:41:00.871 --> 00:41:05.471
a place so far outside the law
that genders have yet to be

00:41:05.471 --> 00:41:08.961
defined,
and it is even pre-grammatical,

00:41:08.961 --> 00:41:13.610
in the sense that it's before
these endings can determine or

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:15.030
express gender.
 

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:20.059
This is suggested by the
locus amoenus--

00:41:20.059 --> 00:41:23.461
remember I have discussed
the locus amoenus or the

00:41:23.461 --> 00:41:26.440
pleasant place before,
like the one we found when

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:29.739
Rocinante was aroused by the
mares after the Marcela and

00:41:29.739 --> 00:41:31.480
Grisóstomo episode.
 

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:35.599
The locus amoenus,
which is the perfect site for

00:41:35.599 --> 00:41:39.110
amorous exchange,
enhances Dorotea's appeal.

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:42.922
There are light and shade
patterns, there's water that

00:41:42.922 --> 00:41:44.650
reflects and distorts.
 

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:49.152
I'm quoting the translation:
"It was a place through

00:41:49.152 --> 00:41:53.737
which there ran a little smooth
stream cool and pleasantly

00:41:53.737 --> 00:41:58.000
shaded by some rocks and
neighboring trees."

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.246
The waters of the brooks full
of reflections and refractions

00:42:02.246 --> 00:42:05.987
that repeat and distort her
image increase her erotic

00:42:05.987 --> 00:42:06.780
appeal.
 

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:10.398
First, her feet in the water
look like pieces of glass,

00:42:10.398 --> 00:42:12.880
as transparent as the water
itself.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:16.130
Later, her hands acquire the
whiteness of snow.

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:20.150
Her golden hair would provoke
the envy of Apollo.

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:25.699
These are symmetries and
reflections concurrent with the

00:42:25.699 --> 00:42:31.047
larger ones concerning the
various characters and plot

00:42:31.047 --> 00:42:32.260
strands.
 

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:35.804
I'm trying to establish here a
relationship between these

00:42:35.804 --> 00:42:38.777
locus amoenus and what
takes place in it,

00:42:38.777 --> 00:42:41.690
and that overall pattern of
these stories.

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:44.958
All of these episodes are made
of correlations between the

00:42:44.958 --> 00:42:47.940
plot, the characters,
the settings and the scenes.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:50.972
Dorotea is a correlative
opposite of Luscinda,

00:42:50.972 --> 00:42:53.869
who is aristocratic but has
little money;

00:42:53.869 --> 00:42:56.099
Dorotea is rich,
but not aristocratic.

00:42:56.099 --> 00:42:59.659
Dorotea is also Cardenio's
counterpart, lost as she is in

00:42:59.659 --> 00:43:03.027
the solitudes of the woods,
fleeing disguised from her

00:43:03.027 --> 00:43:03.599
fate.
 

00:43:03.599 --> 00:43:07.288
Symmetries and order contrast
with the disorder caused by the

00:43:07.288 --> 00:43:09.869
"pestilencia
amorosa",

00:43:09.869 --> 00:43:14.206
the amorous pestilence that Don
Quixote spoke about in the

00:43:14.206 --> 00:43:16.260
speech of the Golden Age.
 

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:21.041
That imagined Golden Age and
this locus amoenus are

00:43:21.041 --> 00:43:25.907
shown to be artifices that
conceal desire in a semblance of

00:43:25.907 --> 00:43:30.621
order,
but ultimately cannot contain

00:43:30.621 --> 00:43:33.760
it and violence ensues.
 

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:37.858
So I want you to have clear in
your mind what is at stake here

00:43:37.858 --> 00:43:41.150
in this locus amoenus and
this violent,

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:45.369
not overtly violent,
but this violent possession of

00:43:45.369 --> 00:43:48.409
Dorotea by the gaze of these
men,

00:43:48.409 --> 00:43:52.798
and the relationship that all
of this has with the overall

00:43:52.798 --> 00:43:56.650
pattern of the stories that I am
analyzing here.

00:43:56.650 --> 00:44:00.918
Dorotea hurts her feet when she
tries to flee barefooted over

00:44:00.918 --> 00:44:02.268
the rocky ground.
 

00:44:02.268 --> 00:44:06.623
She is physically wounded,
as she was when she lost her

00:44:06.623 --> 00:44:11.804
virginity to Fernando,
and as she was almost wounded,

00:44:11.804 --> 00:44:15.753
again,
when the servant tried to rape

00:44:15.753 --> 00:44:21.721
and she threw him over a cliff--
we don't know if he's dead--and

00:44:21.721 --> 00:44:24.407
later,
where her employer tried to

00:44:24.407 --> 00:44:25.309
seduce her.
 

00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:26.920
These are dangerous woods.
 

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:31.804
So the story of Cardenio,
Luscinda, Fernando and Dorotea

00:44:31.804 --> 00:44:35.179
is told from at least two
perspectives,

00:44:35.179 --> 00:44:38.199
both Cardenio's and Dorotea's.
 

00:44:38.199 --> 00:44:41.494
It is also told in various
moments, and with the attendant

00:44:41.494 --> 00:44:44.039
interruptions that I have been
mentioning.

00:44:44.039 --> 00:44:47.623
All is assembled under the
umbrella of the main story to

00:44:47.623 --> 00:44:51.340
get Don Quixote out of the
Sierra Morena and back home.

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:55.025
The stories are all united by
the theme of love,

00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:58.320
but considered at many
different levels.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:04.414
Now, we move on to the
hilarious invention of Princess

00:45:04.414 --> 00:45:11.199
Micomicona by the priest and
this whole episode conceived to

00:45:11.199 --> 00:45:15.570
try to get Don Quixote back
home,

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:19.228
by inventing a fictional
chivalric romance which will

00:45:19.228 --> 00:45:24.786
take him back to his village,
because to reach the kingdom of

00:45:24.786 --> 00:45:28.518
Micomicón he will have
to,

00:45:28.518 --> 00:45:30.170
according to the story they
tell him,

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:31.110
go by his village.
 

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:36.206
So Dorotea's story as Princess
Micomicona is a translation of

00:45:36.206 --> 00:45:37.989
her real situation.
 

00:45:37.989 --> 00:45:41.860
Javier Herrero,
I put his name there.

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:45.804
He is a good friend of mine,
with whom I agree and disagree

00:45:45.804 --> 00:45:47.300
always respectfully.
 

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.340
He summarizes the situation
thus:

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:54.293
"Princess Micomicona,
of the kingdom of

00:45:54.293 --> 00:45:57.516
Micomicón,
is the daughter of a magician

00:45:57.516 --> 00:45:59.532
king Tinacrio,
the wise man,

00:45:59.532 --> 00:46:01.550
and the Queen Jaramilla.
 

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:05.148
By means of his science the
king finds out that some day the

00:46:05.148 --> 00:46:08.382
princess will be an orphan,
and a terrible giant,

00:46:08.382 --> 00:46:12.369
Pandafilando de la Fosca Vista,
[whom we have met before]

00:46:12.369 --> 00:46:16.715
so called because he squints to
frighten people will usurp the

00:46:16.715 --> 00:46:17.500
kingdom.
 

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:20.666
The king further prophesied
that only one knight could

00:46:20.666 --> 00:46:22.878
defeat the giant,
the famous Spaniard,

00:46:22.878 --> 00:46:24.969
Don Quixote de la Mancha."
 

00:46:24.969 --> 00:46:28.139
That's the synopsis that Javier
gives us.

00:46:28.139 --> 00:46:32.262
There is substance to
characters invented by

00:46:32.262 --> 00:46:35.833
characters;
that is, Pandafilando de la

00:46:35.833 --> 00:46:39.338
Fosca Vista,
and Princess Micomicona,

00:46:39.338 --> 00:46:44.606
and Tinacrio the Wise are all
characters invented by the

00:46:44.606 --> 00:46:47.960
priest and performed by Dorotea!
 

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:53.675
So these characters invented by
characters acquire substance

00:46:53.675 --> 00:46:57.043
within the fiction;
they are meta-fictional

00:46:57.043 --> 00:46:57.739
characters.
 

00:46:57.739 --> 00:47:08.269
Now, Pandafilando's name
suggests lust.

00:47:08.269 --> 00:47:11.250
He is a pan-philanderer.
 

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:13.480
What is a philanderer?
 

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:16.210
Philanderer is a man who has
many love affairs.

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:19.097
So "pan,"
generalized,

00:47:19.097 --> 00:47:21.518
"philanderer."
 

00:47:21.518 --> 00:47:25.385
Actually, if you back to the
Greek, it's lover of man,

00:47:25.385 --> 00:47:28.155
but pan philanderer,
he is a pan lover,

00:47:28.155 --> 00:47:30.708
a persistent,
recidivist, insistent,

00:47:30.708 --> 00:47:33.690
prolific lover;
this is Pandafilando,

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:35.139
this imagined giant.
 

00:47:35.139 --> 00:47:40.512
The name Micomicona is at first
glance funny,

00:47:40.512 --> 00:47:42.710
it sounds funny.
 

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:45.210
But it has several resonances.
 

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:47.420
It has to do with monkeys.
 

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:52.268
She is from Micomicón,
the kingdom of monkeys.

00:47:52.268 --> 00:47:54.920
"Mono"
is the most common word for

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.670
"monkey"
in Spanish,

00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:59.675
but "mico"
means "monkey"

00:47:59.675 --> 00:48:01.090
in a more general way.
 

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:04.150
What do monkeys do?
 

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:06.699
Monkey see, monkey do.
 

00:48:06.699 --> 00:48:12.085
Monkeys imitate humans in a
comical way, only form,

00:48:12.085 --> 00:48:16.090
not substance;
they are like parodies of us.

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:19.704
If you've been to the zoo and
you stand in front of the monkey

00:48:19.704 --> 00:48:23.021
cage and you see that they seem
to be making fun of us by

00:48:23.021 --> 00:48:24.030
imitating us.
 

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:29.422
Indirectly and humorously,
the issue of mimesis is brought

00:48:29.422 --> 00:48:31.599
up here by Cervantes.
 

00:48:31.599 --> 00:48:35.199
Mimesis was the Renaissance
doctrine of imitation,

00:48:35.199 --> 00:48:40.300
the imitation of the classics;
the imitation of the classic

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:45.309
models to come closer to the
imitation of reality.

00:48:45.309 --> 00:48:49.739
Mimesis has to do with
representation.

00:48:49.739 --> 00:48:54.179
You can hear its etymological
relatives: to mimic,

00:48:54.179 --> 00:48:58.708
to mime, and mimetic,
and one can hear even a faint

00:48:58.708 --> 00:49:01.789
echo of mimesis in Micomicona.
 

00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:05.760
But Micomicona,
here, means that she is from

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:10.748
the kingdom of monkeys,
of a kingdom of representation,

00:49:10.748 --> 00:49:13.150
a kingdom of parodies.
 

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:15.650
This is what this means.
 

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:19.780
But Micomicona is here also
Dulcinea's rival,

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:25.228
because Sancho wants very badly
for his master to marry the

00:49:25.228 --> 00:49:29.360
princess so that he can get his
kingdom.

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:36.474
She is a copy of Dulcinea,
or an echo of Dulcinea,

00:49:36.474 --> 00:49:42.719
remember that Dulcinea and
Dorotea rhyme.

00:49:42.719 --> 00:49:48.454
Now, the Dulcinea who now
appears is the one that Sancho

00:49:48.454 --> 00:49:53.250
makes up in his lie about his
visit to her--

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:56.690
Remember, the kind of brawny,
smelly,

00:49:56.690 --> 00:49:59.429
Dulcinea who gives him a piece
of cheese.

00:49:59.429 --> 00:50:02.585
He gets next to her and he
says, she's tall,

00:50:02.585 --> 00:50:05.228
and she smells,
and Don Quixote says,

00:50:05.228 --> 00:50:06.989
how could she smell?
 

00:50:06.989 --> 00:50:09.550
You were probably smelling
yourself, and Sancho said,

00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:12.110
yes, it could because I smell
like that sometimes.

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:16.369
It's all very funny--But why is
Sancho telling the lie?

00:50:16.369 --> 00:50:20.293
Because Sancho wants Don
Quixote to marry the princess,

00:50:20.293 --> 00:50:22.983
so he's trying to bring
Dulcinea down,

00:50:22.983 --> 00:50:26.409
to make her look bad;
but Don Quixote is not

00:50:26.409 --> 00:50:29.920
deterred, he says,
no, no, no, you must have this

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:30.579
wrong.
 

00:50:30.579 --> 00:50:35.295
Now, so remember that Dorotea
and Dulcinea rhyme,

00:50:35.295 --> 00:50:40.307
which underscores the
relationship that they have at

00:50:40.307 --> 00:50:44.730
this very heady now
meta-fictional level.

00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:44.945
See?
 

00:50:44.945 --> 00:50:47.798
This is a meta-fictional level
what the characters are

00:50:47.798 --> 00:50:50.751
creating,
what the priest is creating,

00:50:50.751 --> 00:50:55.335
what Dorotea is creating by
representing by performing the

00:50:55.335 --> 00:50:57.634
story,
and what Sancho is creating

00:50:57.634 --> 00:50:58.409
with his lie.
 

00:50:58.409 --> 00:51:01.150
Now, we know now what is behind
the lie, Sancho's lie.

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:04.282
Remember, all of these stories
always have something behind

00:51:04.282 --> 00:51:06.659
them, or are always telling
another story.

00:51:06.659 --> 00:51:10.652
The story being told here is
that Sancho wants Don Quixote to

00:51:10.652 --> 00:51:14.639
marry the Princess Micomicona,
not to marry Dulcinea so he's

00:51:14.639 --> 00:51:16.429
trying to make her look bad.
 

00:51:16.429 --> 00:51:22.672
There is another rhyming echo
here that reveals to what extent

00:51:22.672 --> 00:51:28.402
the story that Dorotea is
telling is a version of her own

00:51:28.402 --> 00:51:33.934
predicament: "Pandafilando,
Fernando,"

00:51:33.934 --> 00:51:38.340
"Pandafilando,
Fernando."

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:39.518
You see?
 

00:51:39.518 --> 00:51:45.681
There is a connection here,
an oral connection between the

00:51:45.681 --> 00:51:47.518
two characters.
 

00:51:47.518 --> 00:51:58.518
So this character who is
lustful, and that Herrero will

00:51:58.518 --> 00:52:07.480
claim later is an allegory of
lust itself.

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:14.005
Now, at one point,
nearly everybody here is in

00:52:14.005 --> 00:52:15.599
disguise.
 

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:19.559
Some men have been in drag
playing various roles,

00:52:19.559 --> 00:52:24.094
even Sancho is playing the role
of the squire of a bogus

00:52:24.094 --> 00:52:25.579
knight-errant.
 

00:52:25.579 --> 00:52:30.735
The deep question about this
episode with these

00:52:30.735 --> 00:52:37.349
meta-fictional levels is about
the theatricality of life.

00:52:37.349 --> 00:52:40.643
This is where the
Quixote leads us,

00:52:40.643 --> 00:52:45.224
again, to ask questions that
are pertinent and relevant to

00:52:45.224 --> 00:52:46.349
our lives.
 

00:52:46.349 --> 00:52:49.750
Is living the playing of roles?
 

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:54.654
Are we characters in somebody
else's fiction as these

00:52:54.654 --> 00:52:56.730
characters are here?
 

00:52:56.730 --> 00:53:00.853
And if so, for instance,
are we bound by ethics if we

00:53:00.853 --> 00:53:04.739
are just mere characters in
somebody's fiction?

00:53:04.739 --> 00:53:09.090
There are stories within
stories creating the infinitely

00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:12.730
receding sequence that I spoke
about before.

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:16.695
We can lose track of the real
and of the self in such a

00:53:16.695 --> 00:53:19.351
construct,
as I told you little boys used

00:53:19.351 --> 00:53:22.699
to do when they went to the
barber shop and saw all of these

00:53:22.699 --> 00:53:26.469
repeated images of themselves--
Who, where are you?

00:53:26.469 --> 00:53:27.659
Who are you?
 

00:53:27.659 --> 00:53:31.541
I have heard that under
hypnosis we cannot be made to do

00:53:31.541 --> 00:53:34.786
anything that goes against our
sense of values,

00:53:34.786 --> 00:53:36.409
against our morals.
 

00:53:36.409 --> 00:53:42.494
However, in dreams we do
transgress principles and engage

00:53:42.494 --> 00:53:47.494
in this wish fulfillment
fantasies, in which we

00:53:47.494 --> 00:53:50.320
transgress principles.
 

00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.670
Freud's The Interpretation
of Dreams, published in

00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:56.990
1900,
suggests and has suggested for

00:53:56.990 --> 00:54:02.202
the twentieth century an
analogue for literature and for

00:54:02.202 --> 00:54:04.760
these levels of fiction.
 

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:09.710
Where does literature stand
among all of these states of

00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:10.340
mind?
 

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:14.577
In his own dream,
Don Quixote will go on with his

00:54:14.577 --> 00:54:19.079
madness, he will continue to be
mad in his dream.

00:54:19.079 --> 00:54:22.420
In the stories that they make
up, however,

00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:25.759
Micomicona and Sancho do tell
their deeper desires and

00:54:25.759 --> 00:54:28.686
apprehensions,
a subconscious force is

00:54:28.686 --> 00:54:31.349
stronger than their will to lie.
 

00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:34.992
They want to lie and they and
they tell the truth,

00:54:34.992 --> 00:54:35.960
indirectly.
 

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:48.980
These are the issues that this
complex of stories suggest.

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:58.789
Now, let me talk,
for comic relief,

00:54:58.789 --> 00:55:02.507
as we come to the end,
and since we're talking about

00:55:02.507 --> 00:55:06.329
values and principles,
about an obscene passage in

00:55:06.329 --> 00:55:07.809
the Quixote.
 

00:55:07.809 --> 00:55:12.775
Herrero--Javier--claims that
the "rabo,"

00:55:12.775 --> 00:55:17.740
the tail that the barber
borrows for the innkeeper's wife

00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:21.737
means her genitals,
and that the obscene reference

00:55:21.737 --> 00:55:25.224
to it leads to an identification
of Pandafilando with the

00:55:25.224 --> 00:55:25.909
phallus.
 

00:55:25.909 --> 00:55:31.730
Hence, Don Quixote cuts off a
phallus, the symbol of lust.

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:35.922
I think that it is mostly just
a dirty joke on the part of

00:55:35.922 --> 00:55:39.654
Cervantes,
who is having fun with a keen

00:55:39.654 --> 00:55:45.393
reader that he imagines could
understand the obscenity behind

00:55:45.393 --> 00:55:46.159
this.
 

00:55:46.159 --> 00:55:51.081
The innkeeper's wife says--and
I'm going to read it first in

00:55:51.081 --> 00:55:53.521
Spanish:
"Para mí

00:55:53.521 --> 00:55:58.164
santiguada [you remember that
they borrow the oxtails that she

00:55:58.164 --> 00:56:03.021
had where she kept her comb,
so first the priest and the

00:56:03.021 --> 00:56:06.791
barber can make a beard and look
different]

00:56:06.791 --> 00:56:11.994
que no se ha aún de
aprovechar más de mi rabo

00:56:11.994 --> 00:56:15.313
para su barba,
y que me ha de devolver mi

00:56:15.313 --> 00:56:18.594
cola, que anda de lo mi marido
por esos suelos que es una

00:56:18.594 --> 00:56:20.059
vergüenza:
digo,

00:56:20.059 --> 00:56:22.329
el peine, que solía yo
colgar de mi buena cola."

00:56:22.329 --> 00:56:25.134
"By my faith,
[this is Jarvis],

00:56:25.134 --> 00:56:29.139
you shall you use my tail no
longer for a beard.

00:56:29.139 --> 00:56:31.960
Give me my tail again,
for my husband's thing is

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:34.420
tossed up and down that it is a
shame,

00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:36.985
I mean the comb,
I used to stick in my good

00:56:36.985 --> 00:56:37.780
tail."
 

00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:41.210
Hmmmm...
 

00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:45.552
Herrero, writes--I think,
over interpreting,

00:56:45.552 --> 00:56:49.289
my dear friend:
"This is then the extended

00:56:49.289 --> 00:56:53.005
joke the barber has taken away
the innkeeper's wife tail into

00:56:53.005 --> 00:56:56.907
which the innkeeper used to put
his thing [this is a translation

00:56:56.907 --> 00:56:59.570
literal]
also referred to as his comb.

00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:02.516
When the barber gave it back to
her, she complained that it is

00:57:02.516 --> 00:57:04.981
completely spoiled,
that it has lost its hair,

00:57:04.981 --> 00:57:08.322
and that it will not serve any
longer for what her husband used

00:57:08.322 --> 00:57:08.969
it."
 

00:57:08.969 --> 00:57:12.260
Herrero continues:
"As we are going to show

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:15.460
you immediately,
[but I will spare you his

00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:17.835
proofs], tail,
rabo or cola

00:57:17.835 --> 00:57:20.730
means the loins both male and
female genitals and so the arse,

00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:23.405
culo,
and beard has a similar

00:57:23.405 --> 00:57:24.170
meaning.
 

00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:27.030
Cervantes has created with is
multiplicity of obscure

00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:29.737
meanings,
[I don't think they're very

00:57:29.737 --> 00:57:32.242
obscure]
a constellation of sexual

00:57:32.242 --> 00:57:35.657
images which are finally
conveyed on the giant

00:57:35.657 --> 00:57:37.099
himself."
 

00:57:37.099 --> 00:57:38.750
I can't go there with Javier.
 

00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:40.670
I think that the joke is very
clear;

00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:43.494
I don't think it's very
obscure, it's very clear,

00:57:43.494 --> 00:57:44.789
and it's very funny.
 

00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:47.898
I don't see how it can be
extended to the giant,

00:57:47.898 --> 00:57:51.800
however, but one wonders why
Cervantes included this obscene

00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:53.190
joke in the text?
 

00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:56.858
As I said, I think he's just
having fun with the reader who

00:57:56.858 --> 00:57:58.059
could pick it up.
 

00:57:58.059 --> 00:58:02.572
Now, the stories,
sub-stories and interruptions

00:58:02.572 --> 00:58:06.400
in relation to memory bring to
mind--

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.309
going back to the beginning of
my lecture today--

00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:12.018
bring to mind the issue of
Cervantes's oversights,

00:58:12.018 --> 00:58:15.880
particularly the one about
Sancho's stolen donkey.

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.489
What does it mean?
 

00:58:17.489 --> 00:58:21.650
Perhaps that creation is the
flawed product of memory.

00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:24.795
One critic has suggested,
as I believe I said before,

00:58:24.795 --> 00:58:28.730
that Cervantes included errors
in the Quixote purposely.

00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:33.711
I doubt it, because he did try
desperately to fix them within

00:58:33.711 --> 00:58:34.460
months.
 

00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:41.550
But the errors are consistent
with certain characteristics of

00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:47.222
the Quixote,
such as improvisation and the

00:58:47.222 --> 00:58:51.949
faulty or creative nature of
memory.

00:58:51.949 --> 00:58:56.630
By making mistakes we create
deviating from models.

00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:59.494
What I'm saying is that the
mistakes of memory,

00:58:59.494 --> 00:59:02.670
as we've seen in the stories
told by the characters,

00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:03.730
are creative.
 

00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:07.590
What is the value of the
sub-texts--

00:59:07.590 --> 00:59:10.918
if we could use that word--that
we found beneath the stories

00:59:10.918 --> 00:59:15.329
being told,
like the one about Dorotea's

00:59:15.329 --> 00:59:19.512
predicament,
and the one that Cardenio is a

00:59:19.512 --> 00:59:20.780
really telling?
 

00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:24.635
To learn that sometimes,
perhaps all of the time,

00:59:24.635 --> 00:59:28.329
a story is the deflected
version of another.

00:59:28.329 --> 00:59:30.329
So what?
 

00:59:30.329 --> 00:59:35.382
So the pleasure lies in the
gradual discovery of the story

00:59:35.382 --> 00:59:38.485
within the story,
as with the entire

00:59:38.485 --> 00:59:40.170
Quixote.
 

00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:45.315
All this has to do with the
nature of narrative and with the

00:59:45.315 --> 00:59:50.706
nature of literature,
a multilayered discourse whose

00:59:50.706 --> 00:59:56.860
gist is precisely its hidden
meanings that surface in odd

00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:57.739
ways.
 

00:59:57.739 --> 01:00:01.177
Why did Cervantes embed these
stories about Cardenio,

01:00:01.177 --> 01:00:04.614
Luscinda, Dorotea and Don
Fernando within the overall

01:00:04.614 --> 01:00:06.730
story of the Quixote?
 

01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:09.918
Did he think that they,
or the main story,

01:00:09.918 --> 01:00:12.329
could not stand on their own?
 

01:00:12.329 --> 01:00:16.300
The stories are reflections of
the main story as we have seen,

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.250
both in their themes and by
their inner structures,

01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:21.599
the characters create other
characters,

01:00:21.599 --> 01:00:23.960
the stories are broken up and
started again,

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:26.780
many characters displayed some
sort of madness,

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:29.460
they are like mirror images of
Don Quixote.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:33.014
Mostly, I believe,
Cervantes was searching for a

01:00:33.014 --> 01:00:37.659
way to create a new genre,
he did not know yet which,

01:00:37.659 --> 01:00:41.050
that would allow for this
mixture,

01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:44.780
the sequential plot of the
chivalric romance,

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:50.518
the multistory kind of book
produced by the Italians.

01:00:50.518 --> 01:00:55.704
A new genre that would also for
this a mixture of main story and

01:00:55.704 --> 01:01:00.016
dependent or lateral stories,
and he did create it,

01:01:00.016 --> 01:01:04.250
he created what came to be
known as the novel by doing

01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:04.889
this.
 

01:01:04.889 --> 01:01:08.751
Now, beyond literature,
the most significant idea

01:01:08.751 --> 01:01:13.257
behind this intermingling and
the errors is to posit that

01:01:13.257 --> 01:01:17.556
memory is the self,
that the self is memory with

01:01:17.556 --> 01:01:21.360
all of its flaws and its holes
and its gaps.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:26.003
Remember that the novel,
the Quixote,

01:01:26.003 --> 01:01:30.539
begins with a willful act of
forgetting;

01:01:30.539 --> 01:01:36.507
that village in La Mancha,
whose name the narrator does

01:01:36.507 --> 01:01:39.050
not want to remember.
 

01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:45.000

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
You'll remember
from last lecture,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.700
Gwendolyn Brooks's--what
I think at least,

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.600
is a haunting
poem--"We Real Cool."

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.600
We real cool.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.900
We Left school.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.567
We Lurk late.

00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:17.267
We Strike straight.

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:18.267
We Sing sin.

00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:19.267
We Thin gin.

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:21.200
We Jazz June.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.400
We Die soon.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.700
Written in 1966, but
really stands in for,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.567
in so many ways, this
fundamental shift that I've

00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:31.600
been talking about the
last couple of lectures,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.700
and sort of the
mentality from mid-1960s,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.700
heading into the end of the
1960s.&nbsp; And that's where we

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.400
are in the course right
now.&nbsp; For this lecture will

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.200
be the last heavily focused
on the 1960s.&nbsp; Although it

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.700
will come up again in
next week's lectures,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.000
it will only be
coming up really in,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.600
in fleeting
fashion.&nbsp; So really,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.000
we're beginning to move
out of the 1960s with this

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
lecture.&nbsp;We've been
lingering over the--this

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.400
period, this decade, for
essentially three weeks,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.000
two and a half
weeks of the course,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.100
in no small measure because
it is the famous height of

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.167
the civil rights
movement, but because,

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:17.300
even though I've been trying
to rewrite that narrative

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.300
for you, the fact is,
there are so many different

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.367
competing lines of
activism, of change,

00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:30.200
of struggle, of frustration,
of political brinksmanship

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.500
of all different sorts,
all really captured in this

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.467
moment.&nbsp; Moments
of great promise,

00:01:37.467 --> 00:01:39.100
followed by moments
of great confusion,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.467
moments of great
promise again,

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:43.400
moments of great confusion,
and then despair.&nbsp;

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.167
Overwhelmingly, the story
of the late 1960s is one of

00:01:48.167 --> 00:01:51.867
political and
cultural confusion,

00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:54.467
and one striking moment
of--anxiety is far too

00:01:54.467 --> 00:02:00.467
polite a word to put
on it, but real fear,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.267
about what, where this
country's headed or how it's

00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:11.567
going to get to where
it should be headed.&nbsp;The

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:16.100
barometer, as I pointed out
quite some time ago for a

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.167
lot of these
changes in the 1960s,

00:02:17.167 --> 00:02:19.600
is the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee.&nbsp; I

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.500
want to start there by
telling you the end of this,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.500
of SNCC's story,
essentially.&nbsp; So you'll

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.800
remember that SNCC
was founded out of the,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.800
the sit-in movement in
1960, college-age students,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.300
Shaw, North Carolina.&nbsp; It
was brought under the wing

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.000
of the--organized under
the wing of the SCLC,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
embraced an integrationist
ethos.&nbsp; Respectability was

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.100
at its core.&nbsp; Belief in
group's inner leadership and

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.100
is dedicated to
civil rights education,

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.300
where there's
voter registration,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.900
leadership
training, et cetera,

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.500
in the early 1960s.&nbsp; The
cracks start to appear as it

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.500
struggled to
find its own voice,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.000
feeling smothered by
King's presence.&nbsp; Selma,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the famous Bloody
Sunday march that SNCC led,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.400
and Tuesday turnaround
that, that King orchestrated

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.100
without SNCC's awareness
or knowledge marked a

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.800
fundamental break in the
org--between those two

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.100
organizations.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.000
SNCC then goes on a journey
over the next handful of

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
years about what it's going
to be and how it's going to

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.300
run.&nbsp; It's caught up in the
Black Power passion of the

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.500
time.&nbsp; Stokely Carmichael
consolidates leadership

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.700
within his very charismatic
self-representation.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.400
SNCC kicks whites
out of the movement,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.200
forms a temporary alliance
through Carmichael's doing

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.867
with the Black Panthers, but
SNCC is too radical for the

00:03:38.867 --> 00:03:45.767
Panthers on race
lines.&nbsp; I'll come back and

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:48.300
over--overlap a few little
details in today's lecture

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:55.400
about this, but essentially,
Carmichael leaves SNCC.&nbsp; He

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.900
has no future there.&nbsp;
And he leaves the country,

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.600
in reasons I'll get to later
on in the lecture.&nbsp; In the

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.900
leadership void left
behind by Carmichael,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.467
you have a cadre of
different leaders battling

00:04:06.467 --> 00:04:09.100
it out, who's going to be
the person representing

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.700
SNCC.&nbsp;Meanwhile, the
organization is infiltrated

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.900
by the FBI.&nbsp; Seeds of doubt
are sown left and right.&nbsp;

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.367
And the Student
Non--Nonviolent Coordinating

00:04:19.367 --> 00:04:22.367
Committee changes its
name to the Student National

00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:25.000
Coordinating Committee.&nbsp;
In the height of late 1960s

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.300
violence, which is part of
the theme of this lecture,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.367
it disavows
nonviolence as a solution,

00:04:31.367 --> 00:04:35.600
or as a tactic, or as a
belief system.&nbsp; All bets are

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.900
off.&nbsp; So it goes
from nonviolent civil

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.167
disobedience,
integration ethos,

00:04:44.167 --> 00:04:46.600
to an all-black
organization,

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.700
far more progressive than
it was when it started and

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.800
eschewing nonviolence as a
core mission.&nbsp; Leadership

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.367
gets broken up, different
kinds of battles.&nbsp; FBI

00:04:58.367 --> 00:05:01.900
infiltrates it
successfully, and by 1973,

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.300
with leadership in disarray,
scattered throughout the,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.000
the globe actually, the FBI
closes the file on SNCC.&nbsp;

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.067
There's nothing left of
the organization.&nbsp; SNCC is a

00:05:12.067 --> 00:05:15.300
metaphor for the great
successes and great failures

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:22.600
and great anxieties of the
1960s.&nbsp;This was a decade of

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.100
great crescendos and
great collapses.&nbsp; Great

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.767
crescendos, of course,
with--embodied in King and

00:05:27.767 --> 00:05:31.367
his dream, embodied in the
signing of the Civil Rights

00:05:31.367 --> 00:05:34.867
Act and the Voting Rights
Act.&nbsp; But as we've seen,

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:36.400
immediately after
these crescendos,

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.267
great
collapses.&nbsp; Four young,

00:05:39.267 --> 00:05:41.600
young girls blown
up in Birmingham,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.900
riots in Watts.&nbsp; So you
arrive at the moment,

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.800
and this is where the
lecture really begins--this

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.500
was all preface--you arrive
at the moment of 1966,

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.600
after Selma,
King casting about,

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.700
I think it's really
the fair word to use,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.300
casting about for the next
step of the movement.&nbsp; Selma

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.567
was, even though SNCC was
infur--was furious with,

00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:10.200
with King, the
successful--the final march

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.100
was one of the, is, remains,
one of the great iconic

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.967
moments of the, sort of
the famous narrative of the

00:06:16.967 --> 00:06:20.767
civil rights movement.&nbsp; But
it became just profoundly

00:06:20.767 --> 00:06:23.900
clear to King, and
to others of course,

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.700
that these great
changes in, in,

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:31.200
in law, the great changes
in national consciousness,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.967
were overwhelmingly seen
as southeastern phenomena,

00:06:36.967 --> 00:06:39.300
southeastern United States
phenomena.&nbsp; This is where

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.200
the problem was.&nbsp;You saw
in whites the--in Watts,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.600
excuse me, the problem was
something quite different.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.167
You see in the great
northern cities of the

00:06:47.167 --> 00:06:50.667
country, the problem was
really quite different.&nbsp;

00:06:50.667 --> 00:06:53.400
They have these laws on
the books already.&nbsp; And King

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.400
goes, decides to go to
Chicago in '66 to try to

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.267
address some of
these deeply woven,

00:06:57.267 --> 00:07:02.700
deeply embedded problems
that ran along racial lines

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.700
in the great cities of the
North and the Northeast.&nbsp;

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.300
This is where the next stage
of the civil rights movement

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.100
is going to be fought,
according to King.&nbsp; King had

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.467
been talking about, from
the beginning of his rise to

00:07:18.467 --> 00:07:20.800
national prominence, he had
been talking about economics

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.500
and poverty.&nbsp;
However, at this moment,

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:30.100
'66, partly out of result of
searching for the next great

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.867
agenda for the movement,
partly out of the shifting

00:07:33.867 --> 00:07:35.900
logics of how the U.S.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.300
economy is functioning
on a global scale,

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.700
partly out of the radicalism
and the internationalist

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.800
radicalism that starts
being articulated more

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.567
aggressively by SNCC and
would soon be articulated by

00:07:45.567 --> 00:07:48.500
the Black Panther Party,
with its Marxist ideology,

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.000
King really starts to
emphasize poverty.&nbsp; This is

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.100
the next frontier of the
movement.&nbsp; This is what we

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:58.567
need to address.&nbsp; So
King goes to Chicago,

00:07:58.567 --> 00:08:00.800
takes the SCLC with him,
the Southern Christian

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.167
Leadership
Conference with him,

00:08:03.167 --> 00:08:06.900
and sees in Chicago de
facto housing segregation,

00:08:09.867 --> 00:08:16.700
limited educational
opportunities.&nbsp; He sees

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.400
Chicago as, or the, the way
life is lived in Chicago,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.800
as a manifestation of
economic exploitation,

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.800
pure and simple,
as manifested,

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.867
grows out of, is part
of, the housing problems,

00:08:31.867 --> 00:08:34.300
educational
opportunity differential,

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:38.100
manifested in trade unions
and the way in which trade

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.500
unions kept the color line
intact.&nbsp; It's manifested in

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:47.267
real estate, who could live
where.&nbsp; It's manifested in

00:08:47.267 --> 00:08:48.600
banks, the kind of
loans you can get,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.000
if you can get
loans.&nbsp; Mortgage companies,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.200
slum landlords,
the welfare system,

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.800
federal agencies,
courts, police,

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.700
political system, the
city administration.&nbsp; It was

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.867
systemic,
economic exploitation,

00:09:05.867 --> 00:09:09.200
the way it was witnessed,
the way it was experienced

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:15.200
in Chicago.&nbsp;So King and SCLC
moves from a rather point

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.500
specific series of campaigns
about voter registration

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:29.300
drives, for instance,
campaigns related to racial

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.367
discrimination
written in the law books,

00:09:32.367 --> 00:09:33.800
segregation
written, you know,

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.100
de jour into the law
books, and recognized,

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.067
"We've got a much
bigger problem here."&nbsp; The

00:09:41.067 --> 00:09:43.600
diversity of the agenda that
King starts to pursue when

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.400
he's looking at economic
exploitation in all the

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.667
different places in which
it makes itself known in

00:09:47.667 --> 00:09:53.500
Chicago, it's the diversity
of the nature of the

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.500
problem, ultimately
turns into King's undoing in

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.300
Chicago.&nbsp; Chicago is,
giving away the punch line,

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:06.900
a, a moment of profound
failure for King.&nbsp; So King

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.267
is in Chicago, setting
up shop and by July,

00:10:10.267 --> 00:10:13.600
the midsummer, things are
organized enough and he

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.667
prepared enough
logistically,

00:10:14.667 --> 00:10:17.167
he organizes a march.&nbsp;
He takes several thousand

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:21.667
marchers to city
hall in Chicago,

00:10:21.667 --> 00:10:24.067
and much like his namesake
quite some time ago,

00:10:24.067 --> 00:10:28.300
tacks twenty-four demands
to the door.&nbsp; Demands called

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.067
for an end to racial
discrimination in the kinds

00:10:31.067 --> 00:10:35.600
of institutions I mentioned
just a moment ago.&nbsp; It was

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.867
actually not much more than
pub--a publicity stunt that

00:10:39.867 --> 00:10:42.867
King hoped would
create space for him at the

00:10:42.867 --> 00:10:45.400
bargaining table with
Chicago's Mayor Richard

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.167
Daley.&nbsp; A month later,
finally getting an audience

00:10:47.167 --> 00:10:53.167
with Daley, King presents a
ten-point plan on housing.&nbsp;

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.467
Daley works with the
plan.&nbsp; They sign this plan

00:11:05.467 --> 00:11:10.867
together, and it's calling
for open housing reform.&nbsp; So

00:11:10.867 --> 00:11:14.400
it seems like King's made
some difference already.&nbsp;

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.000
Daley's a staunch Democrat
but really embodied--I mean,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.600
he owned Chicago
politics, heck,

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.700
he owned state politics.&nbsp;
And King got Daley to sign

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.967
this pledge for housing
reform.&nbsp; The signing a

00:11:28.967 --> 00:11:30.767
pledge isn't
really doing anything,

00:11:30.767 --> 00:11:32.567
except for putting your name
on a piece of paper.&nbsp; You've

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:35.000
got to put political will
behind it.&nbsp; And Daley didn't

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.800
want to expend any
of it when it came to

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:42.500
enforcement.&nbsp; So King's
earliest efforts in Chicago

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.600
are merely symbolic
efforts.&nbsp; It's not actually

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.900
creating change.&nbsp; Now
Chicago locals were very

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.100
excited about King's arrival
and his pres--and his,

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:57.000
and his abiding presence.&nbsp;
He's staying in town.&nbsp; Black

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.567
Chicagoans believe that
now that King was there,

00:12:00.567 --> 00:12:05.167
the city and the country
would pay attention to the

00:12:05.167 --> 00:12:10.600
problems that blacks faced
on a daily basis.&nbsp; But the

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.267
excitement begins to fade
just as quickly as it was

00:12:13.267 --> 00:12:15.667
built up.

00:12:15.667 --> 00:12:19.700
&nbsp;Bless you.&nbsp; Locals begin
to realize that King's not

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:23.200
really well suited for the
complexities of the northern

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.567
black world.&nbsp; And
that sounds kind of

00:12:24.567 --> 00:12:26.167
condescending.&nbsp; I'm
not talking about,

00:12:26.167 --> 00:12:27.700
you know, does
he know how to,

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.667
you know, buy a
loaf of bread and,

00:12:29.667 --> 00:12:33.800
you know, act properly;
that's not it at all.&nbsp; The

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.700
problem is, is
that King is used to,

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:36.700
because of the legal
structures of discrimination

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:42.700
in the South, used to a very
simple political landscape.&nbsp;

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.800
Blacks had no
voting presence,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.367
they had no representational
presence.&nbsp; There were local

00:12:52.367 --> 00:12:54.967
activists, certainly, but
they did not--they were not

00:12:54.967 --> 00:12:57.100
emboldened in the way--I
mean they did not have the

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:02.600
kind of support network
behind them to catapult

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.500
things to the national
scene.&nbsp; That's not the case

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:10.500
in Chicago.&nbsp;Chicago had
significantly more diverse

00:13:13.567 --> 00:13:16.267
populations within
the black community,

00:13:16.267 --> 00:13:18.800
just in the city itself,
than any single place King

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.000
had been before and tried to
wage a campaign.&nbsp; There were

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.567
many other people who were
established leaders in the

00:13:26.567 --> 00:13:28.567
community, who were
recognized as such,

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:36.067
and they had their access
to Mayor Daley.&nbsp; Then King

00:13:36.067 --> 00:13:39.700
comes in and wants to
have access by himself,

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:46.667
not understanding the
political theater that

00:13:46.667 --> 00:13:50.800
defined Chicago.&nbsp; To put
simply--I mean to put it in

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.800
its most simple, simple way,
King comes to Chicago and

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.900
without realizing it, steps,
starts stepping on the toes

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.300
of all these other black
leaders who are already in

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.700
place, who had
their organizations,

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:05.900
who had their movements,
and who had access.&nbsp; Now the

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:11.000
real split between
Chicagoans and King happens

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.900
in a swirl of events
that surround a march,

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.000
a march into Cicero, one
of Chicago's most famously

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.800
all-white enclaves.&nbsp;King
organizes a march to call

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.800
attention like he's done on
so many other occasions to

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.100
systemic discrimination, and
the way it's been embodied

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:34.900
in Chicago, and then
at the last minute,

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:40.900
tries to cancel it when,
when Daley agrees to sign a,

00:14:45.667 --> 00:14:51.067
a new housing plan.&nbsp; The
actors who had committed

00:14:51.067 --> 00:14:58.100
themselves to the march
were furious and decided to

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.400
proceed without
King.&nbsp; Now right there,

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.100
there's the
difference.&nbsp; In the case of,

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.600
if you think back to
Selma just a year earlier,

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.300
slightly more
than a year earlier,

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.900
Bloody Sunday following
Tuesday turnaround,

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.100
Chicago--Chicagoans
saying, "There will be no

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.767
turnaround.&nbsp; We've seen you
do this before and we're not

00:15:14.767 --> 00:15:21.200
going to abide by it up
in Chicago."&nbsp; It's also

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.900
important--so, so
the, the Chicago,

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.200
the local activists decides,
"We're going to march

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.567
without King.&nbsp; We don't care
if he signed anything with

00:15:28.567 --> 00:15:34.000
the mayor."&nbsp;Now what's also
important to realize is that

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.100
the Chicago activists were
not trained in a culture of

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:45.800
non-vil--nonviolent civil
rights activism.&nbsp; Now I

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.567
think I've already
mentioned before,

00:15:47.567 --> 00:15:51.067
there was a lot of
violence in the civil rights

00:15:51.067 --> 00:15:54.867
movement, violence on all
sides.&nbsp; But there was also a

00:15:54.867 --> 00:15:57.000
commitment, a rhetorical
and then a lived commitment,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.400
to a nonviolent tradition.&nbsp;
One clip actually,

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.400
I'm sorry, I didn't get
a chance to show you,

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.767
when it came to
Freedom Summer,

00:16:02.767 --> 00:16:05.967
black and white students
coming down to Mississippi

00:16:05.967 --> 00:16:08.100
and having to walk through
gauntlets where they were

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:13.200
actually beaten by fellow
activists to get them ready

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.600
for what might happen in
Mississippi.&nbsp; And if they

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.200
started to fight back,
they couldn't go out in the

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.000
field.&nbsp; I mean, the training
was literally bruising.&nbsp;

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.300
Chicagoans didn't have that
training.&nbsp; So you have an

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:32.667
untrained but politically
experienced and savvy group,

00:16:32.667 --> 00:16:34.967
diverse group of
activists coming together,

00:16:34.967 --> 00:16:38.700
to march on
Cicero; a lot of anger,

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:45.267
a lot of fear as a result.&nbsp;
Knowing all these different

00:16:45.267 --> 00:16:48.167
facts were in place, the
National Guard is brought in

00:16:48.167 --> 00:16:50.700
immediately.&nbsp; We're not even
going to wait for a riot to

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.700
happen.&nbsp; We're going to
start with the National

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.400
Guard being in place.&nbsp; The
National Guard is there to

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:59.600
ensure that the march
proceeds peacefully.&nbsp; But in

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:05.000
a telling sign, the
guardsmen's rifles are with,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.500
with fixed bayonets, are
pointed at the marchers

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.200
instead of at the hecklers
who line the street to

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.667
protest the march's
arrival.&nbsp; So the marchers

00:17:16.667 --> 00:17:19.067
are walking through a
gauntlet of guardsmen,

00:17:19.067 --> 00:17:21.500
there to protect them, but
the marchers are facing the

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.600
bayonets and the
rifles.&nbsp; Well,

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:32.067
the march proceeds,
but then hecklers,

00:17:32.067 --> 00:17:34.067
who were there behind
the National Guard line,

00:17:34.067 --> 00:17:37.400
start throwing rocks and
bottles and most of the

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.200
marchers start returning
fire.&nbsp; Now it's nothing

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.900
short of a miracle that the
march does not explode into

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:47.100
a riot.&nbsp; But it didn't
accomplish anything either.&nbsp;

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.800
Well, I guess it
accomplished the fact that

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.800
King's leadership
style was really,

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.667
at that point, now
considered irrelevant in

00:17:55.667 --> 00:17:57.500
Chicago.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.300
&nbsp;Now I've simplified
these--this story about King

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.500
and Chicago for
the sake of time,

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.200
but this is the core
fact, is that King comes to

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:09.600
Chicago as the testing
ground for his new campaign

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.367
to bring attention to
economic exploitation.&nbsp; It's

00:18:13.367 --> 00:18:15.400
part of his new agenda
relating to poverty or,

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.200
as, are more clearly
articulated agenda relating

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.100
to poverty.&nbsp; And his
organization and his style

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:28.167
just don't work.&nbsp; They don't
line up with the structured

00:18:28.167 --> 00:18:32.300
politics in a place like
Chicago.&nbsp; Now complicating

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.400
things further
in all of this,

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.900
especially for King, is the
escalating war in Vietnam.&nbsp;

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.900
I've made allusions to it
a couple of times already,

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.700
but now we're at a point of
crisis for King.&nbsp; He is a

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.467
pronounced pacifist.&nbsp; He
was always against the war,

00:18:52.467 --> 00:18:56.900
but he had kept his opinions
quiet in order to ensure

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.300
successes in the
civil rights agenda,

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.967
the different battles he was
fighting up to that point.&nbsp;

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
King starts to wrestle
openly with what he sees as

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.767
the morality happening
over in Southeast Asia,

00:19:13.767 --> 00:19:15.400
that he's silent
on that regard,

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.700
on that front, that he's
talking about the immorality

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.400
and now the economic system
in the United States.&nbsp; He

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.400
couldn't reconcile
the two.&nbsp; Meanwhile,

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:32.000
King's fellow civil rights
leaders make a point of

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.800
talking King out of making a
public announcement against

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.900
the Vietnam War.&nbsp; So King,
really seen as the leader of

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.800
the movement--there's a lot
of air quotes there--"the

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.200
leader" of "the movement,"
he's really one of equals of

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.967
the leaders of several
other major civil rights

00:19:48.967 --> 00:19:50.967
organizations, the
National Urban League,

00:19:50.967 --> 00:19:55.900
the NAACP most famously,
and they're now trying to

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.200
silence him, saying, "You
cannot risk everything we've

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:03.200
been fighting for, for this
war someplace else."&nbsp; One

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.900
such leader, Whitney
Young, of the National Urban

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.267
League, advised
King to, quote,

00:20:07.267 --> 00:20:09.467
"leave the war
to the experts,

00:20:09.467 --> 00:20:11.700
 and that, quote, "the Negro
was more concerned about the

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:17.700
rat at night and the job
in the morning."&nbsp; Young,

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.200
Whitney Young, I
should point out,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.900
was pulled aside--or
pulled aside King at Lyndon

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:32.300
Johnson's insistence.&nbsp; The
White House had been working

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:39.167
for--closely with these
leaders now for years,

00:20:39.167 --> 00:20:40.567
working with John F.

00:20:40.567 --> 00:20:42.500
Kennedy before he was
assassinated.&nbsp; He's,

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.700
you know, trying to convince
them to change their agenda

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:49.200
in certain ways for the sake
of the civil rights bill

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.467
success, but they're
working with John F.

00:20:51.467 --> 00:20:53.400
Kennedy, they're
working with Lyndon Baines

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.167
Johnson.&nbsp;And this in itself
is a radical shift.&nbsp; I mean,

00:20:56.167 --> 00:20:58.600
think back to 1941 when A.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.000
Philip Randolph
bluffs his way,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.900
basically, into a meeting
with FDR.&nbsp; Now leaders of

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.500
civil rights
organiz--organizations are

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.967
called into the Oval
Office frequently.

00:21:10.967 --> 00:21:14.600
"How can we manage this
crisis?&nbsp; I need your advice,

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.600
 on this, that, or the
other.&nbsp; Well Johnson,

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.867
who's finding himself now
stuck in Vietnam and trying

00:21:21.867 --> 00:21:23.867
to find a way out,
although he's escalating it,

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.267
Johnson tells the
civil rights leaders,

00:21:30.267 --> 00:21:36.267
hearing rumors about King's
increasing confusion--that's

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.400
not really the word I want
to use--confusion about the

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:49.200
war, or at least the public
agenda.&nbsp; LBJ tells the civil

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.000
rights leaders, "If you
break with me on Vietnam,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.900
I will close my door to
you."&nbsp; I mean LBJ's no

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.667
stranger to brinksmanship.&nbsp;
He's an expert at it,

00:21:59.667 --> 00:22:01.700
and he essentially threatens
the civil rights leaders

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.600
with killing their agenda
if they try to get their

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.100
fingers involved in what
he sees as his agenda,

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.100
that's the war in Vietnam.

00:22:14.567 --> 00:22:18.867
&nbsp;As we move through
1966 and into 1967,

00:22:18.867 --> 00:22:20.867
I mean King got the
message.&nbsp; He knows he's not

00:22:20.867 --> 00:22:23.867
supposed to say anything,
but he finds that he can no

00:22:23.867 --> 00:22:31.267
longer be quiet about this.&nbsp;
And he starts giving talks,

00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:37.267
mostly in the South, about
the war in Vietnam.&nbsp; You

00:22:37.267 --> 00:22:40.000
know, much like the, the
famous "I Have a Dream"

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.967
speech, where, you
know, we only get the,

00:22:43.967 --> 00:22:46.067
the short excerpt that makes
us all feel really wonderful

00:22:46.067 --> 00:22:48.500
and we don't get the
excerpts that make us feel,

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:53.900
well, pretty bad, King
was giving--I mean so the,

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.100
the basic speech is much
longer than what we know.&nbsp;

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.367
King is giving,
not even sermons,

00:22:58.367 --> 00:22:59.800
lectures that
are forty-five,

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:05.167
fifty minutes long, talks,
talking about structural

00:23:05.167 --> 00:23:09.700
inequality, economic
super-exploitation,

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.100
the immorality of the Cold
War battles being played

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.300
out, well, anywhere,
but especially in,

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.367
in the developing world.&nbsp;
Giving the kind of lecture

00:23:17.367 --> 00:23:20.200
you'd expect from a
political scientist or an

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.867
economist and the kind
of detail in political

00:23:23.867 --> 00:23:29.800
economy.&nbsp; He's testing out
the ground basically.&nbsp;And in

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:34.200
the spring of 1967,
he's invited to speak at

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.367
Riverside
Church in Manhattan,

00:23:35.367 --> 00:23:38.500
with a long
tradition of progressivism,

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.200
and he famously
breaks his silence.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.800
I mean he'd been breaking
the silence for months now,

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.767
but now it's on this
national platform.&nbsp; And so

00:23:46.767 --> 00:23:50.700
on April 4th, 1967, King
steps to the pulpit at

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.800
Riverside Church, saying
that he felt he could no

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.800
longer, he could no
longer be silent.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.000
He declares that the
Great Society has been shot

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.767
down--Lyndon
Johnson's Great Society,

00:24:00.767 --> 00:24:05.167
this effort to, you know,
fight a war on poverty--that

00:24:05.167 --> 00:24:06.800
"the Great Society's
been shot down on the

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.000
battlefields of
Vietnam."&nbsp;"It would be very

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
inconsistent for me to teach
and preach nonviolence in

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.200
this situation and then
applaud violence when

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.767
thousands and thousands of
people are being maimed and

00:24:18.767 --> 00:24:20.967
mutilated and many
killed in this war."

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:30.000
Now King is talking about
Vietnamese being killed.&nbsp;

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.467
He's also talking about
American soldiers being

00:24:31.467 --> 00:24:35.067
killed, and it's a, a
theme that you see,

00:24:35.067 --> 00:24:39.200
you hear more from people
on the street who are very

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:43.467
angry.&nbsp; I didn't bring it;
it's in a different lecture,

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.700
but the statistics are
rather stark about who's

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.400
going off to fight in
Vietnam and who's actually

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.000
in the positions of most
danger and who's dying.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.767
The poor,
regardless of the race,

00:24:56.767 --> 00:25:00.000
and African Americans in
numbers far disproportionate

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.867
to their
representation in the U.S.

00:25:01.867 --> 00:25:05.567
public, the poor and blacks
are the ones that are in the

00:25:05.567 --> 00:25:07.767
most dangerous positions and
essentially become cannon

00:25:07.767 --> 00:25:12.567
fodder in the
Killing Fields.&nbsp; So,

00:25:12.567 --> 00:25:15.200
you know, King is not on his
own amongst black leaders

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.867
for being horrified--in
black citizens,

00:25:17.867 --> 00:25:20.700
being horrified what's
happening in Vietnam.&nbsp; He

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.000
decides to
break his silence.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.400
Now, I've chosen to preach
about the war in Vietnam

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.267
today because I
agree with Dante,

00:25:32.267 --> 00:25:38.667
that the hottest places in
hell are reserved for those

00:25:38.667 --> 00:25:44.400
who in a period of
moral crisis maintain their

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.400
neutrality.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:50.800
There comes a time when
silence is betrayal.&nbsp; The

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:55.300
truth of these
words is beyond doubt,

00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:02.300
but the mission to which
they call us is a most

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:03.600
difficult one.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:09.400
Even when pressed by the
demands of inner truth,

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:15.800
men do not easily assume
the task of opposing their

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.667
government's policy,
especially in time of war.

00:26:19.667 --> 00:26:24.700
Nor does the human
spirit move without great

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:30.500
difficulty against all the
apathy of conformist thought

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:37.667
within one's own bosom and
in the surrounding world.

00:26:37.667 --> 00:26:41.800
Moreover, when the issues
at hand seem as perplexing,

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:48.700
as they often do in the case
of this dreadful conflict,

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:55.367
we are always on the
verge of being mesmerized by

00:26:55.367 --> 00:26:56.367
uncertainty.

00:26:56.367 --> 00:26:59.000
But we must move on.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.300
Some of us who have already
begun to break the silence

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:11.667
of the night have found
that the calling to speak is

00:27:11.667 --> 00:27:14.500
often a vocation of agony.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.800
But we must speak.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:22.567
We must speak with all the
humility that is appropriate

00:27:22.567 --> 00:27:27.167
to our limited
vision, but we must speak."

00:27:27.167 --> 00:27:29.300
And as I've
already alluded to,

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.300
or mentioned a
few moments ago,

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.900
King continues to
speak about the linkages

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.600
between--in the
speech--about the linkages

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.067
between
capitalist economies,

00:27:38.067 --> 00:27:40.467
their imperialist tendencies
in the war in Southeast

00:27:40.467 --> 00:27:45.600
Asia.&nbsp; This was not a King
that the national public

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.567
knew; didn't recognize this
person.&nbsp; This was also not a

00:27:49.567 --> 00:27:53.167
King that LBJ was going to
tolerate.&nbsp; He immediately

00:27:53.167 --> 00:27:56.800
distances, distances himself
from King.&nbsp; Just as he

00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.967
threatened to do, he
followed through.&nbsp; The White

00:28:00.967 --> 00:28:05.667
House is now closed to King
and SCLC.&nbsp; Now just as this

00:28:05.667 --> 00:28:11.500
is not a King that people
recognized for his sort of

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.667
laser-like
focus on political,

00:28:13.667 --> 00:28:17.867
economy, hyper-capitalism;
it's a King that's not been

00:28:17.867 --> 00:28:22.500
mor--memorialized for all
of us.&nbsp; It brings us back to

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.267
something that I've
been talking about,

00:28:24.267 --> 00:28:26.067
the issues of
how we remember,

00:28:26.067 --> 00:28:28.200
how we've been taught to
remember the civil rights

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.300
movement and what those
national narratives do as

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:35.167
far as how we interpret our
own notion of what makes a

00:28:35.167 --> 00:28:41.800
citizen.&nbsp;It's a period of
incredible anxiety.&nbsp; Urban

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.767
violence is spreading
unchecked.&nbsp; In Detroit,

00:28:45.767 --> 00:28:49.700
thirty-five people die in a
huge race riot.&nbsp; In Newark,

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.900
nearly as many
as--are left dead.&nbsp; I mean,

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.600
Newark's seen as an
incredible battle zone.&nbsp; The

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.567
statistics of the amount of
bullets that were fired by

00:28:57.567 --> 00:29:01.067
the police state is
rather astonishing,

00:29:01.067 --> 00:29:03.300
on the order of
thousands upon thousands,

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.100
compared to the number of
shots fired by those people

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.167
who were rioting.&nbsp;
And as you know,

00:29:08.167 --> 00:29:12.600
Newark is still struggling
with the legacy of these,

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.767
of these, of what
happened in the 1960s,

00:29:14.767 --> 00:29:20.200
the late sixties.&nbsp; It's a
city still on its mend.&nbsp; In

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:24.000
early 1968, a little less
than a year after he comes

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.300
out against the Vietnam War,
King issues a call for a

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.800
massive protest event,
called the Poor People's

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.800
Campaign.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.100
It's an event that would
take place in Washington,

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.500
D.C., and would
call national,

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.867
and hopefully international,
attention to the plight of

00:29:39.867 --> 00:29:46.400
the poor, regardless of
color.&nbsp; At the same time

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.300
that King's developing
this, the logistics for this

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:53.400
campaign, he agrees to lend
his support to a strike by

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.600
sanitation
workers in Memphis,

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:59.300
Tennessee.&nbsp; Sanitation
workers were clamoring for

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.800
union recognition, and the
city's black community--this

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.867
was largely a black
force--and the city's black

00:30:04.867 --> 00:30:10.800
community lent its hearty
support.&nbsp; The mayor refused

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.200
to acknowledge the
black workers.&nbsp; An economic

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.600
boycott followed that
almost crippled the city,

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.500
and a riot was
barely averted,

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.500
despite the fact that
citizens essentially began

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:29.700
to attack the police on one
occasion.&nbsp; It's a heightened

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:34.600
era of urban violence
and systemic economic

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:39.200
exploitation.&nbsp; King comes to
Memphis in March and tries

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:44.400
to rally the public.&nbsp; He has
to leave town very quickly,

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.967
but he returns.&nbsp; He said he
was going to return in ten

00:30:46.967 --> 00:30:48.600
days, and he vowed
that he would stay put,

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.400
which is not something that
King did.&nbsp; But he would stay

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:56.867
put in Memphis until the
workers were recognized.&nbsp; On

00:30:56.867 --> 00:31:00.400
April 3rd, King speaks to
an audience at a nighttime

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:04.500
rally.&nbsp; Now it's
important to understand,

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.000
by this point in
his young life,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
and he really
was a young man,

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:15.600
King was frustrated and
dismayed.&nbsp; The civil rights

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.467
establishment figures
with whom he had grown up

00:31:19.467 --> 00:31:23.200
politically, that he
had led essentially,

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.500
the establishment figures
had now distanced themselves

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.200
from him.&nbsp; The White
House had cut him off,

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.367
and this was always his
trump card.&nbsp; Remember back

00:31:33.367 --> 00:31:35.167
when, when John F.

00:31:35.167 --> 00:31:36.667
Kennedy's running
for the White House,

00:31:36.667 --> 00:31:40.467
they used each
other to, sort of,

00:31:40.467 --> 00:31:44.400
pull attention to troubled
situations in the South and

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:48.867
Birmingham most famously.&nbsp;
But the White House is now

00:31:48.867 --> 00:31:52.100
closed to him, and
since the successes of '63,

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:56.500
'64, and '65, King had only
been met with a series of

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:01.700
setbacks.&nbsp; Now he's
struggling mightily to pull

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.067
off a new direction in his
public activism via the Poor

00:32:04.067 --> 00:32:08.200
People's Campaign.&nbsp; It's a
bringing together of his

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.400
racial world views
and his economic,

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:16.100
his class world views.&nbsp;For
months leading up to this

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.000
April 3rd speech, King had
been walking round in sort

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.267
of a daze.&nbsp; I mean
if you've seen--I,

00:32:21.267 --> 00:32:24.200
I, I've been trying for
years to find this movie

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:29.300
again.&nbsp; King gives a speech
at Stanford University,

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.100
I want to say '67.&nbsp; I'm
not quite sure of the year,

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.567
but it's between
'67, maybe early '68,

00:32:35.567 --> 00:32:37.200
and the
King--it's a film, it's a,

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.767
you know, full--they filmed
the speech from beginning to

00:32:39.767 --> 00:32:41.800
end.&nbsp; And it is
a King that we,

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.067
that we are not used
to seeing.&nbsp; I mean,

00:32:43.067 --> 00:32:46.400
he is flat out
exhausted and depressed,

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.700
and you only get to
his--some moments,

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.600
you know, four-fifths of the
way through this hour long

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.000
speech or so, where you get
these recognizable moments

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.667
of oratorical
flight.&nbsp; But the rest of it,

00:32:56.667 --> 00:33:01.367
he's, you know, he's just
despairing about the human

00:33:01.367 --> 00:33:06.700
condition.&nbsp; People worried
about him working himself to

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:10.800
a state of exhaustion,
wondering about his spirit.&nbsp;

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.800
They were disturbed by
the fact that he'd been,

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.800
he'd been having
visions of his own death,

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.600
literally thinking that his
time on earth was actually

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:28.467
limited.&nbsp; He's giving
the speech on April 3rd,

00:33:28.467 --> 00:33:30.900
trying to rally the Memphis
sanitation workers in the

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:34.567
community.&nbsp; And then towards
the end of his speech,

00:33:34.567 --> 00:33:39.600
he turns his attention to
his own mortality and his

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.967
notions of how long he
might be on this planet.

00:33:41.967 --> 00:33:46.100
And some began to
say that threats,

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.767
or talk about the
threats that were out.

00:33:50.767 --> 00:33:57.200
What would happen to me
from some of our sick white

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.200
brothers?

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:02.500
Well, I don't know
what will happen now.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:06.000
We've got some
difficult days ahead.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.700
But it really doesn't
matter with me now.

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:14.267
Because I've been
to the mountaintop.

00:34:14.267 --> 00:34:16.000
I don't mind.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.900
Like anybody, I would
like to live a long life.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.200
Longevity has its place.

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:28.367
But I'm not
concerned about that now.

00:34:28.367 --> 00:34:32.467
I just want to
do God's will.

00:34:32.467 --> 00:34:38.300
And He's allowed me to
go up to the mountain.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.700
And I've looked over.

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:44.200
And I've seen
the Promised Land.

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:48.300
I may not get
there with you.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:52.400
But I want you
to know tonight,

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:58.900
that we, as a people, will
get to the Promised Land.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.200
So I'm happy tonight.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.167
I'm not worried
about anything.

00:35:04.167 --> 00:35:07.100
I'm not fearing any man.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:13.567
Mine eyes have seen the
glory of the coming of the

00:35:13.567 --> 00:35:14.567
Lord."

00:35:14.567 --> 00:35:17.567
That would be the last
speech that King would

00:35:17.567 --> 00:35:21.167
give.&nbsp; The next
afternoon, April 4th,

00:35:21.167 --> 00:35:24.000
1968, a year to the date
after he comes out against

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.400
the Vietnam War at
Riverside Church,

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:32.400
he's assassinated.&nbsp; As news
of King's death races across

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:43.200
the country, cities go up in
flames.&nbsp; Uprisings occur in

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.600
over one hundred cities,
over fifty people are killed

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:52.367
collectively, thousands are
injured.&nbsp; Seventy thousand

00:35:52.367 --> 00:35:54.500
troops are called out around
the country to restore

00:35:54.500 --> 00:36:00.000
order.&nbsp; Large sections of
cities like Chicago and

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.867
Washington, D.C., are
wiped out.&nbsp; Chicago's mayor,

00:36:05.867 --> 00:36:12.900
so recently an ally of King,
terrified of what's going to

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.300
happen in the wake of
his assassination--not

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:19.800
terrified, angry--gives his
police the order to shoot to

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.600
kill.&nbsp; I know from
personal experience,

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.967
having done a lot of
research for my dissertation

00:36:25.967 --> 00:36:28.300
and first book,
Washington, D.C.,

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:34.000
at Howard University, these
riots happened in 1968.&nbsp;

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.167
Areas around Howard were
still burned out in the

00:36:38.167 --> 00:36:41.400
early 1990s, I mean,
still.&nbsp; If you've been down,

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:45.400
down to Washington, D.C., in
the last six or seven years,

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:49.000
the city that you see in
those areas around U Street,

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.400
east of Dupont Circle,
north of the capital,

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:58.300
those areas are
unrecognizable.&nbsp; The change

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:02.900
or the restoration of those
parts of the city took well

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:08.900
over thirty years.&nbsp;Now
King's death is one of the

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:20.500
most important moments in a
year of real horror.&nbsp; 1968,

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.000
students on many university
campuses radicalize,

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.200
joining new
protest movements,

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.800
taking over campus
buildings.&nbsp; If you look at

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.867
the buildings of
the early 1970s,

00:37:31.867 --> 00:37:34.800
you can tell what's
basically riot architecture:

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.567
you know, large stone
buildings with very small

00:37:37.567 --> 00:37:41.200
windows that chairs cannot
be thrown through.&nbsp; Radical

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.800
black workers organize
into the Dodge Revolutionary

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.000
Union Movement, the
critique of its economic

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.900
exploitation.&nbsp; LBJ announces
that he will not run for

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:56.900
re-election.&nbsp; Robert F.

00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:00.400
Kennedy is assassinated the
night he wins the California

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:04.967
Democratic primary.&nbsp;
Democratic national

00:38:04.967 --> 00:38:07.900
convention is held in
Chicago.&nbsp; It's a convention

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:12.067
marred by police
rioting.&nbsp; You know,

00:38:12.067 --> 00:38:15.367
they battered demonstrators
and reporters on a daily

00:38:15.367 --> 00:38:21.100
basis.&nbsp; COINTELPRO, the
counterintelligence program,

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:24.300
is trained upon
black radicals,

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.600
starts beating up on
the Black Panthers,

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.600
one of the groups J.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:32.300
Edgar Hoover called "hate
group."&nbsp; Starts infiltrating

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:38.700
S--excuse me, SNCC--and
begins to break that

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.667
organization up.&nbsp;
Around the world,

00:38:41.667 --> 00:38:44.000
the French government
collapses when nine million

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
workers stage a general
strike against Charles de

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.800
Gaulle, only to have the
country's armed forces

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.200
mobilized to restore order.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:53.000
In Mexico, the government
ordered its troops to fire

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.267
upon hundreds of student
protesters who were trying

00:38:55.267 --> 00:38:57.500
to call attention to
their plight in the weeks

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.300
preceding the start of
the Mexico City Olympics.&nbsp;

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:03.100
Famously, Tommy
Smith and John Carlos,

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.300
sprinters for the U.S.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:08.467
Olympic team, did the famous
Black Power salute when they

00:39:08.467 --> 00:39:13.100
were on the medal stand;
stripped of their medals.&nbsp;

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:16.900
Richard Nixon narrowly
defeats Democratic candidate

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:19.100
Hubert Humphrey
for President,

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:23.000
and Nixon wins by brokering
a deal with Strom Thurmond,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.067
a powerful senator
from South Carolina,

00:39:27.067 --> 00:39:30.667
promising Thurmond that he
would lay off the South in

00:39:30.667 --> 00:39:34.667
regards to civil rights
if Thurmond would deliver

00:39:34.667 --> 00:39:36.400
southern votes to Nixon
instead of to the third

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.967
party candidate,
George Wallace,

00:39:37.967 --> 00:39:39.867
who happens to get
nearly ten million votes,

00:39:39.867 --> 00:39:41.867
by the way.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.967
In the midst of
all this confusion,

00:39:52.967 --> 00:39:56.700
King's assassination,
Stokely Carmichael,

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.267
who I already mentioned
as seen as being the heir

00:39:58.267 --> 00:40:04.300
apparent to the civil
rights leadership pantheon,

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:07.700
you know, the next
great black leader.&nbsp; He's

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:10.000
isolated, he's--I mean
essentially not in the

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.800
Panthers, he's
isolated from SNCC,

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.567
but people are still
thinking that he might be

00:40:13.567 --> 00:40:18.700
the one to take up King's
mantle.&nbsp; But in the wake of

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.367
King's
assassination, and D.C.

00:40:21.367 --> 00:40:23.867
going up in
flames especially,

00:40:23.867 --> 00:40:26.600
people start blaming
Carmichael for the riot,

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.300
for fanning the
hysteria about the riot,

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.600
that turns into the riot,
and start blaming him for

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:36.000
not being able to restore
order.&nbsp; And Carmichael

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.500
actually flees the country
and essentially lives in

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:45.067
exile the rest of
his life.&nbsp; The,

00:40:45.067 --> 00:40:47.400
the, quote, "job," and I
really put big quotes around

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:53.200
it, the job of leading black
America is unstaffed and

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.200
maybe unmanageable.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:58.900
In the wake of
King's assassination,

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:00.167
as the riots
are cooling down,

00:41:00.167 --> 00:41:02.867
leaders start to--the other
leaders of the civil rights

00:41:02.867 --> 00:41:04.000
organizations, people in
King's inner-circle are

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.300
saying, "What are we going
to do to honor King?&nbsp; What

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.100
can we do?&nbsp; The count--the
count--the world is in

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:15.200
disarray."&nbsp;Well, there was
the Poor People's Campaign,

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.300
and they decide, you know,
"To honor King's legacy,

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:21.767
we're going to carry forth
with that campaign."&nbsp; They

00:41:21.767 --> 00:41:28.800
see it as a real opportunity
to marry race politics with

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:35.300
class politics, so they
start organizing a plan to

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:38.000
bring poor people from
ten cities and five rural

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.100
districts to
Washington, D.C.,

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.867
and stay for three months,
calling attention to their

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:45.367
daily plight and calling
for a thirty billion dollar

00:41:45.367 --> 00:41:48.767
anti-poverty package, that
included a commitment to

00:41:48.767 --> 00:41:50.767
full
citizen--full employment,

00:41:50.767 --> 00:41:54.000
a guaranteed annual income,
and increased construction

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.167
of low-income
housing.&nbsp;&nbsp; In mid-May,

00:41:59.167 --> 00:42:01.000
the first wave of
demonstrators arrive in

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.600
D.C., and one week
later, Resurrection City,

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.500
it's a, a tent city, is
built on the Washington

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:11.200
Mall, a settlement of tents
and shacks to house the

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:16.800
protesters.&nbsp; But the
campaign is hobbled by

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.500
events that are beyond its
control.&nbsp; It's hoping for

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:23.000
fifteen hundred
protesters to come to D.C.,

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.600
but seven thousand come
instead.&nbsp;During the midst of

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:31.700
the campaign, Robert
Kennedy is assassinated.&nbsp; It

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.300
completely distracts
the government from the

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:40.200
activists in its midst, and
then the skies open up and

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.700
turns Resurrection City
into one big mudflat,

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.900
and very quickly the
escalating public health

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:49.867
problems.&nbsp; There's not
enough housing and tents.&nbsp;

00:42:49.867 --> 00:42:52.900
There's not enough
essentially porta-potties,

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:57.500
there's not enough ways to
feed these people.&nbsp; And the

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.100
government, acting on
concern for the activists'

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:01.800
health--it becomes
an epidemiological

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:04.867
nightmare--closed the camp
after one month.&nbsp; So the

00:43:04.867 --> 00:43:07.500
Poor People's Campaign,
"We're going to be here for

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.100
three months to raise--call
attention to the plight of

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:13.167
poor folks," becomes very
successful in terms of the

00:43:13.167 --> 00:43:16.000
number of people.&nbsp; It
overwhelms logistics,

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.200
and then Mother
Nature intervenes,

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.500
and for the
health of the people,

00:43:22.567 --> 00:43:26.200
the government closes the
camp after one month.&nbsp; This

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:29.200
in the midst of all these
catastrophes had--happening

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:34.500
on the international
stage.&nbsp;So we have at the end

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:38.500
of 1968 a new era of
national politics that

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.600
beginning, that, that marks
the beginning of a backlash

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:45.600
against civil rights gains
and the articulation of

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:48.500
policies that had no
explicit racial reference,

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:52.200
who are clearly coded
racially all the same.&nbsp;

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.900
Nixon, as he's
campaigning and brokering

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:58.067
dealing--brokering a
deal with Strom Thurmond,

00:43:58.067 --> 00:44:02.367
campaigns on a law and order
platform.&nbsp; Such a platform

00:44:02.367 --> 00:44:06.100
made plain that he would go
after black radicals and,

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:09.067
admittedly, the de--the
degenerate hippies and

00:44:09.067 --> 00:44:12.100
anti-war activists who
were destroying the country,

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:16.067
in Nixon's view.&nbsp; Law and
order: "we're going to get

00:44:16.067 --> 00:44:21.000
this house back in shape."&nbsp;
This is the state of affairs

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.900
that leads us out of the
1960s and into the 1970s.&nbsp;

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:29.900
The country's damaged,
profoundly.&nbsp; Its confidence

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:37.267
is shaken, and it's
about to get worse,

00:44:37.267 --> 00:44:43.267
actually.&nbsp; I want to
play for you two clips that

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:53.100
underscore the tenor of
the time.&nbsp; This is an era,

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.400
you know, of, you know, of
great political turmoil,

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.100
but also an era of
incredible cultural

00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:59.300
production, I mean,
astonishing.&nbsp; The Beatles go

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:00.400
from "Yeah, yeah, yeah!"

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:03.200
no matter who they might
have ripped it off from,

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.400
according to
Eldridge Cleaver,

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.900
you know, to the incredible
studio albums of the late

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:11.200
sixties, rock
n' roll, Motown,

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:15.300
all of these things mature
in a way.&nbsp; This is on the

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:18.267
stage of the most important
sort of cultural consumptive

00:45:18.267 --> 00:45:22.267
moments that people had
seen.&nbsp; But closer to the

00:45:22.267 --> 00:45:27.300
ground, you have a marriage
of black activism and anger

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:33.300
and cultural production that
tells a story of despair.&nbsp;

00:45:36.867 --> 00:45:39.300
These are two clips by
spoken word artist Gil

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.100
Scott-Heron.&nbsp; I'll let
them run into the other,

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.167
one into the other.&nbsp; The
first one is an excerpt from

00:45:44.167 --> 00:45:48.200
his performance piece called
"The Revolution Will Not Be

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:55.500
Televised."The next one, a
culture critique of economic

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.500
exploitation and
the, the space race,

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:01.167
while ignoring
folks on the ground,

00:46:01.167 --> 00:46:02.200
it's called
"Whitey on the Moon."

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.600
The revolution will not be
right back after a message

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.700
about a white
tornado, white lightning,

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.700
or white people.

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:12.500
You will not have to
worry about a dove in your

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.567
bedroom, a
tiger in your tank,

00:46:14.567 --> 00:46:17.000
or the giant in
your toilet bowl.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.700
The revolution will
not go better with Coke.

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:22.800
The revolution will not
fight the germs that may

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:23.867
cause bad breath.

00:46:23.867 --> 00:46:26.967
The revolution will put
you in the driver's seat.The

00:46:26.967 --> 00:46:28.667
revolution will
not be televised,

00:46:28.667 --> 00:46:31.400
will not be televised,
will not be televised,

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:32.800
will not be televised.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.200
The revolution will
be no re-run brothers;

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.900
The revolution will be live.

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:40.400
A lot of his lyrics
talking about the--sorry,

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.400
I can't resist saying
something--corporate

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:44.167
capitalism, you know,
talk about all these ad

00:46:44.167 --> 00:46:49.067
campaigns, the "tiger in
your tank" referring to

00:46:49.067 --> 00:46:52.200
Exxon and
talking about, what?,

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.400
Scope and bad breath.&nbsp; I
mean this is--He's fighting

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.300
against what he would
consider the square

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.600
corporate culture of Madison
Avenue and what they're

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.800
trying to sell to
the American people.

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.300
A rat done bit my sister
Nell. (with Whitey on the

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.567
moon) Her face and arms
began to swell.

00:47:18.567 --> 00:47:21.400
(and Whitey's on the moon)
I can't pay no doctor

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:25.800
bills. (but Whitey's on the
moon) Ten years from now

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.900
I'll be payin' still, While
Whitey's on the moon.

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.200
You know, the man jus'
upped my rent las' night,

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.300
'cause Whitey's on the moon.

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.367
No hot water, no
toilets, no lights,

00:47:35.367 --> 00:47:37.700
but Whitey's on the moon.

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:39.800
I wonder why he's uppin' me?

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:41.600
'cause Whitey's on the moon?

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.500
Well I wuz already
givin' 'im fifty a week,

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:46.100
And now
Whitey's on the moon.

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:48.267
Taxes takin' my
whole damn check,

00:47:48.267 --> 00:47:50.500
The junkies make
me a nervous wreck,

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.300
The price of
food is goin' up,

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.500
An' as if all that
crap wuzn't enough,

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.667
A rat done bit
my sister Nell.

00:47:56.667 --> 00:48:00.200
(with Whitey on the moon)
Her face an' arms began to

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:04.100
swell (And Whitey's on the
moon.) Was all that money I

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:07.200
made las' year, For
Whitey on the moon?

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.000
How come I ain't
got no money here?

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.667
Hmm! Whitey's on the moon.

00:48:11.667 --> 00:48:13.600
Y'know I jus'
about had my fill,

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.900
Of Whitey on the moon.

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:20.900
I think I'll sen' these doctor
bills, Airmail special...

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:31.200
To Whitey on the moon.

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.500
They picked an interesting
moment to walk in,

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:34.900
didn't they?&nbsp; [students
laugh]&nbsp; Anyway,

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:40.200
we're going to pick up at
that moment of cultural

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:45.300
challenge, and anger, and
power when we reconvene on

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:48.500
Monday morning.&nbsp;
Have a great weekend.

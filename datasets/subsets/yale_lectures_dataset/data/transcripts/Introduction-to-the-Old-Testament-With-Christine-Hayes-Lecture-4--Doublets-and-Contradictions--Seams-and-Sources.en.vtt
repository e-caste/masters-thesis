00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.898
Professor Christine
Hayes: So,

00:00:02.898 --> 00:00:05.944
last time I gave a reading of
the creation accounts that are

00:00:05.944 --> 00:00:07.080
in Genesis 1 to 3.
 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.201
These are two very different
stories but their placement side

00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:14.910
by side suggests the possibility
of a joint reading.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.063
Nevertheless they are very
different in character,

00:00:17.063 --> 00:00:19.700
and today I want to focus in on
the second creation story.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.248
This is a story that is
predominantly in Genesis 2 and

00:00:23.248 --> 00:00:26.750
trickles into Genesis 3,
and I'm going to look at it

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.620
mostly in isolation from the
first account.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.980
I'm going to be looking at it
in light of an important

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.514
parallel.
This parallel is The Epic of

00:00:34.514 --> 00:00:37.283
Gilgamesh--I get to point
this way now,

00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:38.800
to the boards,
okay?

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.701
The Epic of Gilgamesh,
and I'll be drawing on the work

00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:44.021
of many scholars,
Nahum Sarna probably most

00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:46.655
prominently among them,
but others also who have

00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:50.130
devoted themselves to the study
of these textual parallels,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.550
and developing an
interpretation of these stories.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.069
I'd like you to carry that with
you into your discussion

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:57.864
sections as you look at some of
the other interpretations from

00:00:57.864 --> 00:00:59.880
antiquity and on into the modern
period.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.331
Now The Epic of
Gilgamesh is a magnificent

00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:07.788
Mesopotamian epic that relates
the exploits of a Sumerian king,

00:01:07.788 --> 00:01:09.730
King Gilgamesh of Uruk.
 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.407
That's the name of the
city-state over which he is

00:01:12.407 --> 00:01:15.072
king.
And the epic as we now have it

00:01:15.072 --> 00:01:18.799
was probably composed between
2000 and 1800 BCE.

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.823
Gilgamesh was apparently a
historical character,

00:01:21.823 --> 00:01:25.039
an actual king of Uruk,
but the story of course has

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.870
fantastic and legendary
qualities to it.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.526
We have a full text of the epic
that was located in the library

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:35.230
of Assurbanipal,
an Assyrian king.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.629
It's a seventh century copy of
the story.

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:41.805
But we have fragments that are
much, much older (that date back

00:01:41.805 --> 00:01:44.519
to the eighteenth century) that
were found in Iraq.

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:47.602
So clearly it's an old story
and we have even older

00:01:47.602 --> 00:01:50.500
prototypes for elements of the
story as well.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.000
The story opens with a
description of Gilgamesh.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.530
He's an extremely unpopular
king.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.560
He's tyrannical,
he's rapacious,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.049
he's undisciplined,
he's over-sexed.

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.040
The people in the city cry out
to the gods.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.560
They want relief from him.
 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.664
They particularly cite his
abuses towards the young women

00:02:06.664 --> 00:02:09.689
of the city.
And the god Aruru is told that

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:11.940
she must deal with Gilgamesh.
 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.379
Aruru is on the board.
 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:20.509
So Aruru fashions this noble
savage named Enkidu.

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:23.729
Enkidu is designed to be a
match for Gilgamesh,

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:27.789
and he's very much like the
biblical human in Genesis 2.

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:31.978
He's sort of an innocent
primitive, he appears unclothed,

00:02:31.978 --> 00:02:35.343
he lives a free,
peaceful life in harmony with

00:02:35.343 --> 00:02:38.054
the animals,
with nature and the beasts,

00:02:38.054 --> 00:02:40.690
he races across the steppes
with the gazelles.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.410
But before he can enter the
city and meet Gilgamesh he has

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.787
to be tamed.
So a woman is sent to Enkidu

00:02:48.787 --> 00:02:53.618
and her job is to provide the
sexual initiation that will tame

00:02:53.618 --> 00:02:55.440
and civilize Enkidu.
 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.421
I'm reading now from The
Epic of Gilgamesh (Pritchard

00:02:58.421 --> 00:03:00.717
1958,40-75):
For six days and seven

00:03:00.717 --> 00:03:03.939
nights Enkidu comes forth,
mating with the lass.

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.969
After he had had (his) fill of
her charms,

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.060
He set his face toward his wild
beasts.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.599
On seeing him,
Enkidu, the gazelles ran off,

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.830
The wild beasts of the steppe
drew away from his body.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.930
Startled was Enkidu,
as his body became taut.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.659
His knees were motionless--for
his wild beasts had gone.

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.229
Enkidu had to slacken his
pace--it was not as before;

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:30.689
But he now had [wi]sdom,
[br]oader understanding.

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:33.819
Returning, he sits at the feet
of the harlot.

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:34.919
I'm not sure why that
translation.

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.421
I've been told by those who
know Akkadian that the word

00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:40.328
could mean "harlot/prostitute,"
it could mean some sacred

00:03:40.328 --> 00:03:42.698
prostituteâ€¦ I'm not an expert
in Akkadian.

00:03:42.698 --> 00:03:44.319
But:
He looks up at the face

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.283
of the harlot,
His ears attentive,

00:03:46.283 --> 00:03:48.496
as the harlot speaks;
[The harlot]

00:03:48.496 --> 00:03:49.789
says to him,
to Enkidu:

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:53.190
"Thou art [wi]se,
Enkidu, art become like a god!

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.156
Why with the wild creatures
dost though roam over the

00:03:56.156 --> 00:03:58.170
steppe?
Come, let me lead thee [to]

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.450
ramparted Uruk,
To the holy Temple,

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.534
abode of Anu and Ishtar,
Where lives Gilgamesh,

00:04:03.534 --> 00:04:06.862
accomplished in strength
And like a wild ox lords it

00:04:06.862 --> 00:04:09.376
over the folk."
As she speaks to him,

00:04:09.376 --> 00:04:12.164
her words find favor,
His heart enlightened,

00:04:12.164 --> 00:04:13.620
he yearns for a friend.
 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.060
Enkidu says to her,
to the harlot:

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.459
"Up lass, escort thou me (to
Gilgamesh)â€¦

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.189
I will challenge him [and will
bo]ldly address him."

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:23.750
So that's tablet I from The
Epic of Gilgamesh.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.510
So through this sexual
experience Enkidu has become

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.895
wise, growing in mental and
spiritual stature,

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:34.279
and he is said to have become
like a god.

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:38.399
At the same time there's been a
concomitant loss of innocence.

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:41.509
His harmonious unity with
nature is broken,

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.618
he clothes himself,
and his old friends the

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:46.839
gazelles run from him now.
 

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:48.930
He will never again roam free
with the animals.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.139
He cannot run as quickly.
 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.693
His pace slackens,
he can't even keep up with

00:04:52.693 --> 00:04:55.289
them.
So as one reads the epic one

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.886
senses this very deep
ambivalence regarding the

00:04:58.886 --> 00:05:02.639
relative virtues and evils of
civilized life,

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.410
and many of the features that
make us human.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.363
On the one hand it's clearly
good that humans rise above the

00:05:09.363 --> 00:05:13.383
animals and build cities and
wear clothes and pursue the arts

00:05:13.383 --> 00:05:16.934
of civilization and develop
bonds of love and duty and

00:05:16.934 --> 00:05:19.949
friendship the way that animals
do not;

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.128
these are the things that make
humans like the gods in The

00:05:23.128 --> 00:05:24.399
Epic of Gilgamesh.
 

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:28.001
But on the other hand these
advances have also come at a

00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:30.706
cost.
And in this story there's also

00:05:30.706 --> 00:05:35.051
a sense of longing for the
freedom of life in the wild--the

00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:37.653
innocent,
simple, uncomplicated life

00:05:37.653 --> 00:05:40.536
lived day to day without plans,
without toil,

00:05:40.536 --> 00:05:44.120
in harmony with nature,
a somewhat Edenic existence.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.415
So there are very obvious
parallels between this part of

00:05:47.415 --> 00:05:50.890
the epic that I've just read to
you and our second creation

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.346
story.
Enkidu like Adam is fashioned

00:05:53.346 --> 00:05:55.200
from clay.
He's a noble savage,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.134
he's a kind of innocent
primitive, and he lives in a

00:05:58.134 --> 00:06:00.319
peaceful co-existence with
animals.

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:03.689
Nature yields its fruits to him
without hard labor.

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:07.250
He's unaware of--he's
unattracted by--the benefits of

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.195
civilization:
clothing, cities and all their

00:06:10.195 --> 00:06:13.392
labor.
Just as Enkidu gains wisdom and

00:06:13.392 --> 00:06:17.039
becomes like a god,
and loses his oneness with

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.556
nature,
so Adam and Eve after eating

00:06:19.556 --> 00:06:23.151
the fruit of the knowledge of
good and evil are said to have

00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:25.735
become like gods,
and they also lose their

00:06:25.735 --> 00:06:27.839
harmonious relationship with
nature.

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:31.320
In Genesis 3:15,
God says to the snake:

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.709
"I will put enmity
Between you and the woman,

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:36.490
And between your offspring and
hers;

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.581
They shall strike at your head,
And you shall strike at their

00:06:39.581 --> 00:06:42.019
heel."
Presumably there had been a

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:45.812
peaceful relationship between
creatures like snakes and humans

00:06:45.812 --> 00:06:48.196
to that point.
They are banished now from the

00:06:48.196 --> 00:06:50.221
Garden.
It used to yield its fruits to

00:06:50.221 --> 00:06:53.230
them without any labor,
but now humans have to toil for

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.350
food and the earth yields its
fruits only stintingly.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.000
So in Genesis 3:18,
God says to Adam:

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.920
"Cursed be the ground
because of you;

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.189
By toil shall you eat of it
All the days of your life:

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:06.639
Thorns and thistles shall it
sprout for you.

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:09.200
But your food shall be the
grasses of the field;

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.970
By the sweat of your brow
Shall you get bread to

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.479
eat"
So knowledge or wisdom or

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:17.985
perhaps moral freedom,
seem to come at a very high

00:07:17.985 --> 00:07:20.061
price.
But there are important

00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:22.490
differences between these
stories too.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.895
And the most important has to
do with the nature of the act

00:07:25.895 --> 00:07:29.360
that leads to the transformation
of the human characters.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.372
It's Enkidu's sexual
experience, his seven-day

00:07:32.372 --> 00:07:36.255
encounter with the woman that
makes him wise and godlike at

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:39.000
the cost of his life with the
beasts.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.740
There has been a long tradition
of interpreting the deed or the

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.773
sin of Adam and Eve as sexual,
and there are some hints in the

00:07:50.773 --> 00:07:53.230
story that would support such an
interpretation.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.932
I was just reading recently a
scholarly introduction to

00:07:56.932 --> 00:08:00.087
Genesis that very much argues
and develops this

00:08:00.087 --> 00:08:03.452
interpretation.
Adam and Eve eat from the tree

00:08:03.452 --> 00:08:07.163
of the knowledge of good and
evil in violation of God's

00:08:07.163 --> 00:08:09.458
command.
Now eating can perhaps be a

00:08:09.458 --> 00:08:11.509
metaphor for sex,
some have argued.

00:08:11.509 --> 00:08:14.196
Knowledge of good and
evil--perhaps that could be

00:08:14.196 --> 00:08:15.819
understood in sexual terms.
 

00:08:15.819 --> 00:08:19.437
In biblical Hebrew the word "to
know" can mean "to know" in the

00:08:19.437 --> 00:08:23.110
biblical sense.
It can mean sexual intercourse.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.902
Snakes are symbols of renewed
life and fertility in the East

00:08:26.902 --> 00:08:31.209
because they shed their skins so
they seem to be eternally young;

00:08:31.209 --> 00:08:33.580
and they're also phallic
symbols.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.799
Eve says that the snake seduced
her.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:38.309
uses a term that has some
sexual overtones.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:41.460
So do all of these hints
suggest that,

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.887
in the biblical view,
the change in Adam and Eve came

00:08:45.887 --> 00:08:47.759
about through sex?
 

00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:51.059
If so, is sex a negative thing
forbidden by God?

00:08:51.059 --> 00:08:54.020
It would depend if you view the
change as a negative thing.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.340
That seems unlikely in my view.
 

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.657
You will certainly hear it
argued, but it seems unlikely in

00:08:59.657 --> 00:09:01.609
my view.
God's first command to the

00:09:01.609 --> 00:09:04.049
first couple was to be fruitful
and multiply.

00:09:04.049 --> 00:09:07.750
Now admittedly that comes from
the first creation story in

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.145
Genesis 1;
nevertheless in the second

00:09:10.145 --> 00:09:13.810
creation story when the writer
is recounting the creation of

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.126
woman,
the writer refers to the fact

00:09:16.126 --> 00:09:18.669
that man and woman will become
one flesh.

00:09:18.669 --> 00:09:23.440
So it seems that sex was part
of the plan for humans even at

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.260
creation.
Also, it's only after their

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:30.621
defiance of God's command that
Adam and Eve first become aware

00:09:30.621 --> 00:09:32.058
of,
and ashamed by,

00:09:32.058 --> 00:09:34.882
their nakedness,
putting the sort of sexual

00:09:34.882 --> 00:09:38.714
awakening after the act of
disobedience rather then at the

00:09:38.714 --> 00:09:40.529
same time or prior to.
 

00:09:40.529 --> 00:09:44.082
So maybe what we have here is
another polemic,

00:09:44.082 --> 00:09:48.739
another adaptation of familiar
stories and motifs to express

00:09:48.739 --> 00:09:51.864
something new.
Perhaps for the biblical

00:09:51.864 --> 00:09:55.556
writer, Adam and Eve's
transformation occurs after an

00:09:55.556 --> 00:09:58.964
act of disobedience,
not after a seven-day sexual

00:09:58.964 --> 00:10:01.786
encounter.
The disobedience happens in a

00:10:01.786 --> 00:10:03.180
rather backhanded way.
 

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.809
It's kind of interesting.
 

00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:08.167
God tells Adam before the
creation of Eve that he's not to

00:10:08.167 --> 00:10:11.230
eat of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil,

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.700
that's in Genesis 2:16,
on pain of death.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.800
Eve doesn't hear this command
directly.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.570
She has not yet been created.
 

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.018
In Genesis 3 we meet the
cunning serpent,

00:10:23.018 --> 00:10:27.760
and although many later
Hellenistic Jewish texts and the

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.330
New Testament will identify the
snake as a Satan,

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:36.358
an enticer, a tempter,
some sort of evil creature,

00:10:36.358 --> 00:10:39.730
he doesn't seem to be so in
this fable.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:43.959
There's no real devil or Satan
character--we'll talk about Job

00:10:43.959 --> 00:10:47.842
later--in the Hebrew Bible,
the snake in Eden is simply a

00:10:47.842 --> 00:10:51.551
talking animal.
He's a standard literary device

00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:56.334
that you see in fables of this
period, and later--the kind that

00:10:56.334 --> 00:10:59.960
you find for example in the
fables of Aesop.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.999
And the woman responds to the
serpent's queries by saying that

00:11:03.999 --> 00:11:07.707
eating and even touching the
tree is forbidden on pain of

00:11:07.707 --> 00:11:11.540
death.
One wonders whence the addition

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.159
of touching.
Did Adam convey God's command

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:18.080
to Eve with an emphasis all his
own?

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.720
"Don't even touch that tree,
Eve.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.750
It's curtains for us if you do."
 

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.549
She didn't hear the original
command.

00:11:24.549 --> 00:11:28.555
Or did she just mishear in some
very tragic version of the

00:11:28.555 --> 00:11:31.256
telephone game.
And the serpent tells her,

00:11:31.256 --> 00:11:34.850
No, "you are not going to die"
if you touch or eat the fruit.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.914
In fact, he adds,
the fruit will bring you wisdom

00:11:37.914 --> 00:11:40.980
making humans like gods who know
good and bad.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.960
And in fact that's certainly
true.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.840
He tells her the truth.
 

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.941
Genesis 3:7 is a very critical
verse and it's rarely properly

00:11:49.941 --> 00:11:52.757
translated.
Most translations read like

00:11:52.757 --> 00:11:55.470
this: "She took of its fruit and
ate.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.450
She also gave some to her
husband and he ate."

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.954
The implication is that Eve
acts alone and then she goes and

00:12:01.954 --> 00:12:05.636
finds Adam and gives him some of
the apple and convinces him to

00:12:05.636 --> 00:12:07.678
eat it.
But in fact the Hebrew

00:12:07.678 --> 00:12:10.580
literally reads,
"She took of its fruit and ate

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.357
and gave also to her husband
with her,

00:12:13.357 --> 00:12:15.866
and he ate."
"With her" is a very teeny-tiny

00:12:15.866 --> 00:12:17.765
little word in Hebrew,
so I guess a lot of

00:12:17.765 --> 00:12:19.850
translations figure they can
leave it out.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.309
But the "with her" is there in
the Hebrew.

00:12:22.309 --> 00:12:25.343
At that fateful moment,
Adam and Eve are standing

00:12:25.343 --> 00:12:28.629
together at the tree,
and although only the woman and

00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:30.981
the serpent speak,
Adam was present,

00:12:30.981 --> 00:12:34.429
and it seems he accepted the
fruit that his wife handed him.

00:12:34.429 --> 00:12:37.445
He was fully complicitous,
and indeed God holds him

00:12:37.445 --> 00:12:40.299
responsible.
He reproaches Adam.

00:12:40.299 --> 00:12:42.230
Adam says: Well,
Eve handed it to me.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:43.639
She gave it to me.
 

00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:45.909
Eve explains,
the serpent tricked me.

00:12:45.909 --> 00:12:49.048
God vents his fury on all
three, and he does so in

00:12:49.048 --> 00:12:51.545
ascending order:
first the snake for his

00:12:51.545 --> 00:12:54.940
trickery and then the woman,
and finally the man.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.249
So just as the harlot tells
Enkidu after his sexual

00:12:59.249 --> 00:13:02.870
awakening that he has become
like a god,

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:06.409
so Adam and Eve after eating
the forbidden fruit are said to

00:13:06.409 --> 00:13:07.850
be like divine beings.
 

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:11.387
Why?
Perhaps because they have

00:13:11.387 --> 00:13:17.009
become wise in that they have
learned they have moral choice.

00:13:17.009 --> 00:13:20.704
They have free will,
they can defy God and God's

00:13:20.704 --> 00:13:25.185
plans for them in a way that
animals and natural phenomena

00:13:25.185 --> 00:13:28.649
cannot.
But now that means there is a

00:13:28.649 --> 00:13:32.234
serious danger here,
and in Genesis 3:22,

00:13:32.234 --> 00:13:34.836
God says,
"Now that man has become like

00:13:34.836 --> 00:13:37.890
one of us, knowing good and
evil, what if he should stretch

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.839
out his hand and take also from
the tree of life and eat,

00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:42.049
and live forever?"
 

00:13:42.049 --> 00:13:45.643
So it's the threat of an
immortal antagonist that is so

00:13:45.643 --> 00:13:47.840
disturbing and must be avoided.
 

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.941
And so God banishes Adam and
Eve from the Garden and he

00:13:50.941 --> 00:13:54.467
stations these kerubim,
these cherubim--not puffy cute

00:13:54.467 --> 00:13:57.335
little babies like Raphael
painted, but these fierce

00:13:57.335 --> 00:13:59.360
monstrous creatures--and a
fiery,

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.410
ever-turning sword to guard the
way back to the tree of life.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.740
It is now inaccessible.
 

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.626
So the acceptance of mortality
as an inescapable part of the

00:14:09.626 --> 00:14:12.590
human condition:
it's a part of this story.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:15.799
It's also one of the themes of
The Epic of Gilgamesh.

00:14:15.799 --> 00:14:20.478
As the story continues Enkidu
enters the city and Enkidu earns

00:14:20.478 --> 00:14:23.240
Gilgamesh's respect and deep
love.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.761
This is the first time that
this rapacious tyrant has ever

00:14:26.761 --> 00:14:30.160
actually loved anyone and his
character is reformed as a

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.289
result.
And then the rest of the epic

00:14:32.289 --> 00:14:34.789
contains the adventures of these
two close friends,

00:14:34.789 --> 00:14:36.940
all of the things that they do
together.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.495
And when Enkidu dies,
Gilgamesh is absolutely

00:14:39.495 --> 00:14:41.546
devastated.
He's for the first time

00:14:41.546 --> 00:14:43.519
confronted with his own
mortality.

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:46.863
He's obsessed with grief over
Enkidu, and he's obsessed with

00:14:46.863 --> 00:14:48.620
the whole issue of mortality.
 

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.102
He begins a quest for
immortality, and that takes up

00:14:52.102 --> 00:14:54.220
most of the rest of the epic.
 

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.892
He leaves the city,
he travels far and wide,

00:14:56.892 --> 00:15:00.249
he crosses these primeval seas
and endures all sorts of

00:15:00.249 --> 00:15:03.195
hardships.
And finally exhausted and

00:15:03.195 --> 00:15:08.009
battered he reaches Utnapishtim,
also there on the board,

00:15:08.009 --> 00:15:11.423
Utnapishtim,
who is the only mortal ever to

00:15:11.423 --> 00:15:15.000
have been granted immortality by
the gods,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.799
and he comes to him and asks
for his secret.

00:15:17.799 --> 00:15:20.876
It turns out that Utnapishtim
can't help him,

00:15:20.876 --> 00:15:24.512
and we'll come back to
Utnapishtim later in the flood

00:15:24.512 --> 00:15:27.240
story, and Gilgamesh is
devastated.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:33.120
He then learns the whereabouts
of a plant of eternal youth.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.379
And he says:
Well that's better than

00:15:34.379 --> 00:15:36.328
nothing.
That at least will keep him

00:15:36.328 --> 00:15:38.834
young.
And so he goes after the plant

00:15:38.834 --> 00:15:42.185
of eternal youth,
but he's negligent for a moment

00:15:42.185 --> 00:15:46.304
and a thieving snake or serpent
manages to steal it and that

00:15:46.304 --> 00:15:50.353
explains why snakes are always
shedding their skins and are

00:15:50.353 --> 00:15:53.269
forever young.
Gilgamesh is exhausted,

00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:55.601
he feels defeated,
he returns to Uruk,

00:15:55.601 --> 00:15:59.129
and as he stands looking at the
city from a distance,

00:15:59.129 --> 00:16:02.421
gazing at it,
he takes comfort in the thought

00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:07.059
that although humans are finite
and frail and doomed to die,

00:16:07.059 --> 00:16:11.572
their accomplishments and their
great works give them some

00:16:11.572 --> 00:16:13.710
foothold in human memory.
 

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.862
Now Nahum Sarna is one of the
people who has pointed out that

00:16:17.862 --> 00:16:21.756
the quest for immortality,
which is so central in The

00:16:21.756 --> 00:16:24.995
Epic of Gilgamesh,
is really deflected in the

00:16:24.995 --> 00:16:27.993
biblical story.
The tree of life is mentioned,

00:16:27.993 --> 00:16:30.610
and it's mentioned with a
definite article.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.041
Genesis 2:9 says,
"with the tree of life

00:16:33.041 --> 00:16:35.982
in the middle of the garden,"
as if this is a motif we're

00:16:35.982 --> 00:16:38.104
familiar with,
as if this is something we all

00:16:38.104 --> 00:16:40.265
know about.
But then it's really not

00:16:40.265 --> 00:16:42.679
mentioned again as the story
proceeds.

00:16:42.679 --> 00:16:46.070
The snake, which in The Epic
of Gilgamesh is associated

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.687
with the plant of eternal youth,
in Genesis is associated

00:16:49.687 --> 00:16:53.789
instead with the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil.

00:16:53.789 --> 00:16:57.053
That's the focus of our
attention in Genesis,

00:16:57.053 --> 00:17:01.354
and it's only at the end of the
story that the tree of life

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:05.136
appears again in the passage
that is emphasizing its

00:17:05.136 --> 00:17:07.509
permanent inaccessibility.
 

00:17:07.509 --> 00:17:11.250
And we could perhaps draw two
conclusions from this.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:14.852
First it may be that Adam and
Eve had access to this tree up

00:17:14.852 --> 00:17:18.101
to that point.
As long as their will conformed

00:17:18.101 --> 00:17:21.545
to the will of God,
there was no danger to their

00:17:21.545 --> 00:17:24.329
going on eternally,
being immortal.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:26.210
Once they discovered their
moral freedom,

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:29.030
once they discovered that they
could thwart God and work evil

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.580
in the world,
and abuse and corrupt all that

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.147
God had created,
then God could not afford to

00:17:34.147 --> 00:17:36.539
allow them access to the tree of
life.

00:17:36.539 --> 00:17:40.379
That would be tantamount to
creating divine enemies,

00:17:40.379 --> 00:17:41.809
immortal enemies.
 

00:17:41.809 --> 00:17:45.895
So God must maintain the upper
hand in his struggle with these

00:17:45.895 --> 00:17:48.440
humans who have learned to defy
him.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.217
And he maintains the upper hand
in this, the fact that they

00:17:52.217 --> 00:17:53.650
eventually must die.
 

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:57.587
Second of all the motif of
guards who block access to the

00:17:57.587 --> 00:18:01.102
tree of life suggests that no
humans have access to

00:18:01.102 --> 00:18:05.109
immortality and the pursuit of
immortality is futile.

00:18:05.109 --> 00:18:08.903
So it might be then that God
really spoke the truth after

00:18:08.903 --> 00:18:11.822
all.
The fruit did bring death to

00:18:11.822 --> 00:18:14.475
humankind.
Before we leave this story and

00:18:14.475 --> 00:18:17.528
move onto Cain and Abel,
I just want to make a couple of

00:18:17.528 --> 00:18:18.750
quick observations.
 

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.274
First of all the opening
chapters of Genesis,

00:18:21.274 --> 00:18:23.685
Genesis 1 through 3,
have been subjected to

00:18:23.685 --> 00:18:26.210
centuries of theological
interpretation,

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.738
and I hope that you're in the
midst of reading some of them

00:18:28.738 --> 00:18:31.262
now.
They have generated for example

00:18:31.262 --> 00:18:35.496
the doctrine of original sin,
which is the idea that humans

00:18:35.496 --> 00:18:39.730
after Adam are born into a state
of sin, by definition.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:43.802
As many ancient interpreters
already have observed,

00:18:43.802 --> 00:18:48.690
the actions of Adam and Eve
bring death to the human race.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:52.799
They don't bring a state of
utter and unredeemed sinfulness.

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:56.785
In fact what they tell us is
that humans have moral choice in

00:18:56.785 --> 00:18:58.180
each and every age.
 

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:02.421
The story is primarily
etiological rather then

00:19:02.421 --> 00:19:05.059
prescriptive or normative.
 

00:19:05.059 --> 00:19:07.560
We've talked about this:
these etiological tales are

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.649
tales that are trying to explain
how or why something is the way

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:12.863
it is.
This is why serpents shed their

00:19:12.863 --> 00:19:13.920
skin, for example.
 

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.657
In The Epic of Gilgamesh
they were the ones who got the

00:19:16.657 --> 00:19:17.780
plant of eternal youth.
 

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.130
It's etiological.
 

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:23.936
The writer observes that humans
emerge from innocent childhood

00:19:23.936 --> 00:19:26.299
to self-conscious adulthood.
 

00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:30.825
The writer observes that
survival is a difficult endeavor

00:19:30.825 --> 00:19:35.349
and that the world can sometimes
seem harshly hostile.

00:19:35.349 --> 00:19:38.855
The writer observes that women
are desirous of and emotionally

00:19:38.855 --> 00:19:42.130
bonded to the very persons who
establish the conditions of

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.509
their subordination.
 

00:19:43.509 --> 00:19:47.903
The story is explaining how
these odd conditions of life

00:19:47.903 --> 00:19:51.340
came to be as they are,
which is not to say that it's

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.725
the ideal situation,
or even that it's God's will

00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:56.846
for humankind;
these are etiological fables,

00:19:56.846 --> 00:19:59.279
and they're best read as such.
 

00:19:59.279 --> 00:20:03.659
Second of all in this story we
see something that we'll see

00:20:03.659 --> 00:20:07.887
repeatedly in the Pentateuch,
and that is that God has to

00:20:07.887 --> 00:20:11.144
punt a bit.
He has to modify his plans for

00:20:11.144 --> 00:20:14.401
the first couple,
by barring access to the tree

00:20:14.401 --> 00:20:16.439
of life.
That was not something

00:20:16.439 --> 00:20:18.099
presumably he planned to do.
 

00:20:18.099 --> 00:20:20.675
This is in response to,
perhaps, their unforeseen

00:20:20.675 --> 00:20:22.821
disobedience:
certainly the way the story

00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:24.859
unfolds that's how it seems to
us.

00:20:24.859 --> 00:20:29.291
So despite their newfound
mortality, humans are going to

00:20:29.291 --> 00:20:31.950
be a force to be reckoned with.
 

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:36.069
They're unpredictable to the
very god who created them.

00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:38.519
Finally I'll just draw your
attention to some interesting

00:20:38.519 --> 00:20:41.450
details that you can think about
and maybe talk about in section.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:45.650
God ruminates that the humans
have become like "one of

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.789
us" in the plural.
 

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:51.118
That echoes his words in
Genesis 1 where he proposes,

00:20:51.118 --> 00:20:54.960
"Let us make humans," or
humankind, "in our image."

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.290
Again in the plural.
 

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:58.940
Who is he talking to?
 

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.770
And what precisely are these
cherubim that are stationed in

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.609
front of the tree of life
barring access?

00:21:05.609 --> 00:21:09.715
What do we make of these
allusions to divine colleagues

00:21:09.715 --> 00:21:13.745
or subordinates in light of
Kaufman's claims regarding

00:21:13.745 --> 00:21:15.569
biblical monotheism?
 

00:21:15.569 --> 00:21:18.024
You should be bringing some of
the things we talked about when

00:21:18.024 --> 00:21:20.055
discussing his work,
into dialogue with and in

00:21:20.055 --> 00:21:22.529
conflict with some of the
evidence you'll be finding in

00:21:22.529 --> 00:21:25.163
the text itself.
So think about these things,

00:21:25.163 --> 00:21:29.007
don't pass over these details
lightly, and don't take them for

00:21:29.007 --> 00:21:31.484
granted.
The Cain and Abel story which

00:21:31.484 --> 00:21:35.114
is in Genesis 4:1 through 16:
this is the story of the first

00:21:35.114 --> 00:21:37.571
murder,
and it's a murder that happens

00:21:37.571 --> 00:21:41.316
despite God's warning to Cain
that it's possible to master the

00:21:41.316 --> 00:21:43.650
urge to violence by an act of
will.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:48.027
He says, "Sin couches at the
door;/Its urge is toward you/Yet

00:21:48.027 --> 00:21:50.799
you can be its master," Genesis
4:7.

00:21:50.799 --> 00:21:54.308
Nahum Sarna and others have
noted that the word "brother"

00:21:54.308 --> 00:21:56.940
occurs throughout this story
repeatedly,

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.740
and it climaxes in God's
question, "Where is your

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.140
brother,
Abel?"

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.049
And Cain responds,
"I don't know;

00:22:03.049 --> 00:22:05.180
am I my brother's
keeper?"

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.208
And ironically you sense,
when you read this that,

00:22:08.208 --> 00:22:11.916
even though Cain intends this
as a rhetorical question--"Am I

00:22:11.916 --> 00:22:15.490
my brother's keeper?"--in fact,
he's right on the money.

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.441
Yes.
We are all of us our brothers'

00:22:18.441 --> 00:22:21.835
keepers, and the strong
implication of the story is as

00:22:21.835 --> 00:22:24.525
Sarna puts it,
that all homicide is in fact

00:22:24.525 --> 00:22:27.229
fratricide.
That seems to be the message of

00:22:27.229 --> 00:22:29.303
this story.
Note also that Cain is

00:22:29.303 --> 00:22:33.379
culpable, and for someone to be
culpable of something we have to

00:22:33.379 --> 00:22:36.549
assume some principle that they
have violated.

00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:40.192
And therefore this story
assumes the existence of what

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:42.253
some writers,
Sarna among them,

00:22:42.253 --> 00:22:45.140
have called "the universal
moral law."

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.825
There seems to be in existence
from the beginning of creation

00:22:48.825 --> 00:22:51.098
this universal moral law,
and that is:

00:22:51.098 --> 00:22:53.740
the God-endowed sanctity of
human life.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:57.653
We can connect it with the fact
that God has created humans in

00:22:57.653 --> 00:23:00.886
his own image,
but the God-endowed sanctity of

00:23:00.886 --> 00:23:05.013
human life is an assumption,
and it's the violation of that

00:23:05.013 --> 00:23:07.859
assumption which makes Cain
culpable.

00:23:07.859 --> 00:23:10.649
The story of Cain and Abel is
notable for another theme,

00:23:10.649 --> 00:23:13.539
and this is a theme that's
going to recur in the Bible,

00:23:13.539 --> 00:23:18.129
and that is the tension between
settled areas and the unsettled

00:23:18.129 --> 00:23:21.460
desert areas and desert life of
the nomads.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.109
Abel is a keeper of sheep.
 

00:23:23.109 --> 00:23:27.679
He represents the nomadic
pastoralist, unlike Cain who is

00:23:27.679 --> 00:23:31.596
the tiller of soil,
so he represents more settled

00:23:31.596 --> 00:23:34.707
urban life.
God prefers the offering of

00:23:34.707 --> 00:23:38.761
Abel, and as a result Cain is
distressed and jealous to the

00:23:38.761 --> 00:23:41.991
point of murder.
God's preference for the

00:23:41.991 --> 00:23:46.268
offering of Abel valorizes the
free life of the nomadic

00:23:46.268 --> 00:23:49.119
pastoralist over urban
existence.

00:23:49.119 --> 00:23:52.004
Even after the Israelites will
settle in their own land,

00:23:52.004 --> 00:23:54.731
the life of the desert
pastoralist remained a sort of

00:23:54.731 --> 00:23:56.200
romantic ideal for them.
 

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.808
It's a theme that we'll see
coming up in many of the

00:23:58.808 --> 00:24:01.534
stories.
It's a romantic ideal for this

00:24:01.534 --> 00:24:04.880
writer too.
Now the murder of Abel by Cain

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.160
is followed by some genealogical
lists.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.369
They provide some continuity
between the tales.

00:24:11.369 --> 00:24:16.208
They tell us folkloric
traditions about the origins of

00:24:16.208 --> 00:24:19.859
various arts,
the origins of building,

00:24:19.859 --> 00:24:23.764
of metalwork and music,
but finally in Genesis 6:5 we

00:24:23.764 --> 00:24:28.420
read that, "every imagination of
the thoughts of his heart,"

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.420
the human heart,
"was evil continuously".

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:35.339
And this sets the stage then
for the story of a worldwide

00:24:35.339 --> 00:24:37.195
flood.
Now here again the Bible is

00:24:37.195 --> 00:24:40.124
making use of older traditions
and motifs and adapting them to

00:24:40.124 --> 00:24:41.180
their own purposes.
 

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.452
I've hinted at this already and
we'll look at it in a bit more

00:24:44.452 --> 00:24:46.729
detail now.
We know of a very ancient

00:24:46.729 --> 00:24:48.119
Sumerian flood story.
 

00:24:48.119 --> 00:24:51.839
The hero is Ziusudra,
also on the board.

00:24:51.839 --> 00:24:54.479
We also know of a very early
Semitic work,

00:24:54.479 --> 00:24:58.150
the Epic of Atrahasis,
in which there's a flood.

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:00.862
But the most detailed flood
story we have actually comes

00:25:00.862 --> 00:25:02.490
from The Epic of
Gilgamesh,

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.400
on the eleventh tablet of
The Epic of Gilgamesh.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.199
You'll remember that in his
search for immortality Gilgamesh

00:25:09.199 --> 00:25:12.354
sought out Utnapishtim,
the one human who had been

00:25:12.354 --> 00:25:13.900
granted immortality.
 

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.750
He wants to learn his secret.
 

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:19.138
And when he begs for the secret
of eternal life he gets

00:25:19.138 --> 00:25:22.150
Utnapishtim's story,
and it's the flood story.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:25.620
He learns that Utnapishtim and
his wife gained their

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.273
immortality by a twist of
circumstances:

00:25:28.273 --> 00:25:31.880
they were the sole survivors of
this great flood,

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.869
and as a kind of reward they
were given immortality.

00:25:36.869 --> 00:25:41.755
The Sumerian story of Ziusudra
is very similar to the Genesis

00:25:41.755 --> 00:25:44.157
account.
In both you have the flood

00:25:44.157 --> 00:25:47.819
coming about as the deliberate
result of a divine decision;

00:25:47.819 --> 00:25:51.031
you have one individual who's
chosen to be saved from the

00:25:51.031 --> 00:25:53.024
flood;
that individual is given

00:25:53.024 --> 00:25:55.581
specific instructions on
building an ark,

00:25:55.581 --> 00:25:58.713
and is given specific
instructions on who to bring

00:25:58.713 --> 00:26:00.119
on-board the ark.
 

00:26:00.119 --> 00:26:04.515
The ark also comes to rest on a
mountaintop, the hero sends out

00:26:04.515 --> 00:26:08.910
a bird to reconnoiter the land,
to find out if it's dry yet.

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:12.069
When the hero emerges he builds
an altar.

00:26:12.069 --> 00:26:16.450
He offers sacrifice to the
deity and receives a blessing.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:18.809
Very similar,
parallel stories,

00:26:18.809 --> 00:26:22.740
and yet there are significant
contrasts between the

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:26.829
Mesopotamian story and its
Israelite adaptation.

00:26:26.829 --> 00:26:30.531
Let's compare some of the
elements from all three of the

00:26:30.531 --> 00:26:32.819
stories with the biblical story.
 

00:26:32.819 --> 00:26:36.592
In The Epic of Gilgamesh
we have no motive given for the

00:26:36.592 --> 00:26:38.539
divine destruction whatsoever.
 

00:26:38.539 --> 00:26:41.079
It just seems to be pure
capriciousness.

00:26:41.079 --> 00:26:44.843
In the Epic of Atrahasis
we do in fact read of a reason,

00:26:44.843 --> 00:26:48.181
and the text there states,
"The land became wide and the

00:26:48.181 --> 00:26:49.819
people became numerous.
 

00:26:49.819 --> 00:26:52.299
The land bellowed like wild
oxen.

00:26:52.299 --> 00:26:54.829
The god was disturbed by their
uproar.

00:26:54.829 --> 00:26:58.509
Enlil heard the clamor and said
to the gods, "Oppressive has

00:26:58.509 --> 00:27:00.380
become the clamor ofmankind.
 

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.529
By their uproar they prevent
sleep".

00:27:02.529 --> 00:27:07.117
So it seems that humankind is
to be destroyed because they

00:27:07.117 --> 00:27:10.980
irritate the gods with their
tumult and noise.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:14.642
In the Gilgamesh epic,
Ea, an earth-water god,

00:27:14.642 --> 00:27:18.304
does ask another god,
Enlil, how he could have

00:27:18.304 --> 00:27:21.559
brought the flood on so
senselessly.

00:27:21.559 --> 00:27:23.420
He says, "Lay upon the sinner
the sin;

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.473
Lay upon the transgressor his
transgression",

00:27:25.473 --> 00:27:28.086
which would indicate that in
The Epic of Gilgamesh

00:27:28.086 --> 00:27:30.140
there is this element of
capriciousness.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.993
The biblical writer in
retelling the story seems to

00:27:33.993 --> 00:27:38.462
want to reject this idea by
providing a moral rationale for

00:27:38.462 --> 00:27:41.405
God's actions.
The earth, the text says,

00:27:41.405 --> 00:27:43.769
is destroyed because of
hamas.

00:27:43.769 --> 00:27:47.126
Hamas is a word that
literally means violence,

00:27:47.126 --> 00:27:51.000
bloodshed, but also all kinds
of injustice and oppression.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.976
Noah is saved specifically for
his righteousness,

00:27:53.976 --> 00:27:56.269
he was righteous in his
generation.

00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:58.599
He was chosen therefore for
moral reasons.

00:27:58.599 --> 00:28:01.948
So the writer seems very
determined to tell the story in

00:28:01.948 --> 00:28:05.723
a way that depicts God as acting
not capriciously but according

00:28:05.723 --> 00:28:08.279
to certain clear standards of
justice.

00:28:08.279 --> 00:28:11.863
This was deserved punishment
and the person who was saved was

00:28:11.863 --> 00:28:14.650
righteous.
Furthermore in the Mesopotamian

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:17.990
accounts the gods do not appear
to be in control.

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:21.049
This is something that's been
pointed out by many writers.

00:28:21.049 --> 00:28:25.400
Enlil wants to destroy
humankind completely.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:29.264
He's thwarted by Ea who drops
hints of the disaster to

00:28:29.264 --> 00:28:33.930
Utnapishtim so Utnapishtim knows
what to do and therefore manages

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:35.680
to escape the flood.
 

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.074
But that's thwarting the design
of the god who brought the

00:28:38.074 --> 00:28:40.029
flood.
He wanted everything destroyed.

00:28:40.029 --> 00:28:43.764
When the flood comes the gods
themselves seem to have lost

00:28:43.764 --> 00:28:46.700
control.
They're terrified, they cower.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.892
The text says they "cowered
like dogs crouched against the

00:28:49.892 --> 00:28:52.055
outer wall.
Ishtar," the goddess Ishtar,

00:28:52.055 --> 00:28:53.849
"cried out like a woman in
labor .

00:28:53.849 --> 00:28:56.974
And moreover during the period
of the flood they don't have

00:28:56.974 --> 00:28:58.859
food, they don't have
sustenance.

00:28:58.859 --> 00:29:02.327
At the end when Utnapishtim
offers the sacrifice,

00:29:02.327 --> 00:29:06.734
the gods are famished and they
crowd around the sacrifice like

00:29:06.734 --> 00:29:08.539
flies, the text says.
 

00:29:08.539 --> 00:29:12.119
The biblical writer wants to
tell a different story.

00:29:12.119 --> 00:29:15.404
In the biblical flood story,
God is represented as being

00:29:15.404 --> 00:29:18.629
unthreatened by the forces of
nature that he unleashes,

00:29:18.629 --> 00:29:20.779
and being completely in
control.

00:29:20.779 --> 00:29:23.847
He makes the decision to punish
humans because the world has

00:29:23.847 --> 00:29:25.770
corrupted itself through
hamas,

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:27.589
through bloodshed and violence.
 

00:29:27.589 --> 00:29:31.296
He selects Noah due to his
righteousness and he issues a

00:29:31.296 --> 00:29:33.519
direct command to build an ark.
 

00:29:33.519 --> 00:29:37.465
He has a clear purpose and he
retains control throughout the

00:29:37.465 --> 00:29:39.486
story.
At the end, the writer doesn't

00:29:39.486 --> 00:29:41.766
depict him as needing the
sacrifice for food or

00:29:41.766 --> 00:29:42.460
sustenance.
 

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.579
 
 

00:29:45.579 --> 00:29:49.441
We might say that this story,
like the story of Cain and Abel

00:29:49.441 --> 00:29:53.303
before it, and like the story we
will read later of Sodom and

00:29:53.303 --> 00:29:55.930
Gomorrah,
this story presupposes this

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:59.709
universal moral law that Sarna
and Kaufman and others have

00:29:59.709 --> 00:30:02.688
talked about,
this universal moral law that

00:30:02.688 --> 00:30:06.393
seems to govern the world,
and if God sees infractions of

00:30:06.393 --> 00:30:08.929
it,
then as supreme judge he brings

00:30:08.929 --> 00:30:10.240
humans to account.
 

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.605
If morality is the will of God,
morality then becomes an

00:30:13.605 --> 00:30:16.297
absolute value,
and these infractions will be

00:30:16.297 --> 00:30:18.990
punished, in the biblical
writer's view.

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:22.842
The message of the flood story
also seems to be that when

00:30:22.842 --> 00:30:25.869
humans destroy the moral basis
of society,

00:30:25.869 --> 00:30:29.426
when they are violent or cruel
or unkind, they endanger the

00:30:29.426 --> 00:30:31.450
very existence of that society.
 

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:32.799
The world dissolves.
 

00:30:32.799 --> 00:30:36.638
So corruption and injustice and
lawlessness and violence

00:30:36.638 --> 00:30:39.220
inevitably bring about
destruction.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:42.890
Some writers have pointed out
that it's interesting that these

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:45.960
humans are not being punished
for religious sins,

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.395
for idolatry,
for worshipping the wrong god

00:30:48.395 --> 00:30:51.410
or anything of that nature,
and this is important.

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:55.438
The view of the first books of
the Bible is that each nation

00:30:55.438 --> 00:30:57.760
worships its own gods,
its own way,

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.353
perhaps.
At this point in the story,

00:31:00.353 --> 00:31:04.230
perhaps the view is that all
know of God even if they ignore

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.564
him.
But the view eventually will be

00:31:06.564 --> 00:31:09.710
that only Israel is obligated to
the God of Israel,

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:13.063
other nations aren't held
accountable for their idolatry

00:31:13.063 --> 00:31:14.769
in the books of the Torah.
 

00:31:14.769 --> 00:31:17.470
We'll see this is we continue
along.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:20.291
And yet everyone,
all humans, Israelites or

00:31:20.291 --> 00:31:23.313
non-Israelites alike,
by virtue of having been

00:31:23.313 --> 00:31:27.276
created by God in the image of
God--even though they may not

00:31:27.276 --> 00:31:30.479
know that God,
or may ignore that God--they

00:31:30.479 --> 00:31:34.329
are bound to a basic moral law
that precludes murder and,

00:31:34.329 --> 00:31:37.671
perhaps from this story,
we could argue other forms of

00:31:37.671 --> 00:31:39.309
oppression and violence.
 

00:31:39.309 --> 00:31:43.680
What better way to drive home
the point that inhumanity and

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.975
violence undermine the very
foundations of society than to

00:31:47.975 --> 00:31:52.647
describe a situation in which a
cosmic catastrophe results from

00:31:52.647 --> 00:31:55.359
human corruption and violence.
 

00:31:55.359 --> 00:31:57.583
It's an idea that runs
throughout the Bible,

00:31:57.583 --> 00:32:00.531
it also appears in later Jewish
thought and some Christian

00:32:00.531 --> 00:32:02.289
thought, some Islamic thought.
 

00:32:02.289 --> 00:32:06.124
The Psalmist is going to use
this motif when he denounces

00:32:06.124 --> 00:32:09.410
social injustice,
exploitation of the poor and so

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.751
on.
He says through wicked deeds

00:32:11.751 --> 00:32:15.406
like this "all the foundations
of the earth," are moved,

00:32:15.406 --> 00:32:17.461
"are shaken".
The Noah story,

00:32:17.461 --> 00:32:20.501
the flood story,
ends with the ushering in of a

00:32:20.501 --> 00:32:24.533
new era, and it is in many ways
a second creation that mirrors

00:32:24.533 --> 00:32:27.640
the first creation in some
important ways.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.926
But this time God realizes--and
again this is where God's got to

00:32:30.926 --> 00:32:31.970
punt all the time.
 

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:33.987
This is what I love about the
first part of Genesis--God is

00:32:33.987 --> 00:32:36.109
trying to figure out what he has
made and what he has done,

00:32:36.109 --> 00:32:39.305
and he's got to shift modes all
the time--and God realizes that

00:32:39.305 --> 00:32:41.470
he's going to have to make a
concession.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.801
He's going to have to make a
concession to human weakness and

00:32:44.801 --> 00:32:46.299
the human desire to kill.
 

00:32:46.299 --> 00:32:49.439
And he's going to have to
rectify the circumstances that

00:32:49.439 --> 00:32:52.579
made his destruction of the
earth necessary in the first

00:32:52.579 --> 00:32:55.681
place.
So he establishes a covenant

00:32:55.681 --> 00:32:57.579
with Noah: covenant.
 

00:32:57.579 --> 00:33:00.670
And humankind receives its
first set of explicit laws,

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:02.770
no more implicit,
"Murder is bad."

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:04.210
"Oh I wish I had known!"
 

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:07.063
Now we're getting our first
explicit set of laws and they're

00:33:07.063 --> 00:33:09.529
universal in scope on the
biblical writer's view.

00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:12.210
They apply to all humanity not
just Israel.

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:15.034
So these are often referred to
as the terms of the Noahide

00:33:15.034 --> 00:33:17.710
covenant.
They apply to all humanity.

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:21.269
This covenant explicitly
prohibits murder in Genesis 9,

00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:23.839
that is, the spilling of human
blood.

00:33:23.839 --> 00:33:27.295
Blood is the symbol of life:
that's a connection that's made

00:33:27.295 --> 00:33:28.759
elsewhere in the Bible.
 

00:33:28.759 --> 00:33:32.759
Leviticus 17,
"The lifeâ€¦ is in the blood."

00:33:32.759 --> 00:33:37.300
So blood is the biblical symbol
for life, but God is going to

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:42.220
make a concession to the human
appetite for power and violence.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.236
Previously humans were to be
vegetarian: Genesis 1,

00:33:45.236 --> 00:33:48.555
the portrait was one in which
humans and animals did not

00:33:48.555 --> 00:33:51.270
compete for food,
or consume one another.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:52.990
Humans were vegetarian.
 

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:57.779
Now God is saying humans may
kill animals to eat them.

00:33:57.779 --> 00:34:00.852
But even so,
he says, the animal's life is

00:34:00.852 --> 00:34:05.348
to be treated with reverence,
and the blood which is the life

00:34:05.348 --> 00:34:08.720
essence must be poured out on
the ground,

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.099
returned to God, not consumed.
 

00:34:11.099 --> 00:34:14.572
So the animal may be eaten to
satisfy the human hunger for

00:34:14.572 --> 00:34:17.739
flesh, but the life essence
itself belongs to God.

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:20.639
It must not be taken even if
it's for the purposes of

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:22.798
nourishment.
Genesis 9:4-6,

00:34:22.798 --> 00:34:27.329
you shall not eat flesh with
its life, that is,

00:34:27.329 --> 00:34:30.402
its blood.
For your lifeblood I will

00:34:30.402 --> 00:34:33.914
surely require a reckoning;
of every beast I will require

00:34:33.914 --> 00:34:36.768
it and of humansâ€¦ So if you
are killed by a beast or a

00:34:36.768 --> 00:34:39.829
human, there will have to be a
reckoning, an accounting.

00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:42.979
"â€¦of every person's brother I
will require the life of the

00:34:42.979 --> 00:34:45.208
person.
Whoever sheds the blood of a

00:34:45.208 --> 00:34:48.892
person, in exchange for that
person shall his blood be shed,

00:34:48.892 --> 00:34:51.139
for God made humans in his
image.

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:54.389
All life, human and animal,
is sacred to God.

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:59.093
The covenant also entails God's
promise to restore the rhythm of

00:34:59.093 --> 00:35:03.199
life and nature and never again
to destroy the earth.

00:35:03.199 --> 00:35:07.674
The rainbow is set up as a
symbol of the eternal covenant,

00:35:07.674 --> 00:35:11.442
a token of the eternal
reconciliation between the

00:35:11.442 --> 00:35:13.639
divine and human realms.
 

00:35:13.639 --> 00:35:17.365
We should note that this
notion, or this idea of a god

00:35:17.365 --> 00:35:21.091
who can even make and keep an
eternal covenant is only

00:35:21.091 --> 00:35:25.519
possible on the view that God's
word and will are absolute,

00:35:25.519 --> 00:35:30.514
insusceptible to nullification
by some superior power or some

00:35:30.514 --> 00:35:32.179
divine antagonist.
 

00:35:32.179 --> 00:35:35.475
Now, I handed out,
or there was handed out to you

00:35:35.475 --> 00:35:36.780
a sheet of paper.
 

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.774
You might want to get that out
in front of you because we're

00:35:39.774 --> 00:35:42.819
going to talk a little bit about
the flood story in Genesis 6

00:35:42.819 --> 00:35:45.799
through 9.
When we read the flood story in

00:35:45.799 --> 00:35:49.459
Genesis 6 through 9,
we're often struck by the very

00:35:49.459 --> 00:35:51.070
odd literary style.
 

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:53.914
I hope you were struck by the
odd literary style,

00:35:53.914 --> 00:35:56.760
and the repetitiveness and the
contradictions.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:00.033
So I want to ask you now,
and be brave and speak out,

00:36:00.033 --> 00:36:03.495
in your reading of the story
did anything of that nature

00:36:03.495 --> 00:36:06.039
strike you?
Was the story hard to follow?

00:36:06.039 --> 00:36:08.970
Was it self-contradictory,
and in what ways?

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:11.800
Anything?
Just don't even be polite,

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.100
just throw it right out there.
 

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:16.392
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:36:16.392 --> 00:36:19.125
Professor Christine
Hayes: Okay,

00:36:19.125 --> 00:36:22.289
we seem to have two sets of
instructions.

00:36:22.289 --> 00:36:24.899
Someone's pointing out here,
we seem to have two sets of

00:36:24.899 --> 00:36:27.936
instructions about what to bring
on-board: either to bring two of

00:36:27.936 --> 00:36:31.848
each sort of living thing,
animals and birds and creeping

00:36:31.848 --> 00:36:36.493
things, or in another passage
God tells Moses to bring on

00:36:36.493 --> 00:36:41.552
seven pairs of pure animals and
one pair of impure animals and

00:36:41.552 --> 00:36:43.294
seven pairs of birds.
 

00:36:43.294 --> 00:36:45.949
Right?
Different sets of instructions.

00:36:45.949 --> 00:36:47.879
Anything else strike you as odd
when you were reading this

00:36:47.879 --> 00:36:48.150
story?
 

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:51.289
 
 

00:36:51.289 --> 00:36:53.493
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Christine

00:36:53.493 --> 00:36:55.381
Hayes: Okay,
rain seems to be there for

00:36:55.381 --> 00:36:57.269
different amounts of time,
doesn't it?

00:36:57.269 --> 00:37:00.099
There are some passages in
which the flood is said to have

00:37:00.099 --> 00:37:02.730
lasted for 40 days,
or be on the earth for 40 days.

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:08.381
We find that in Genesis 7:17,
but in Genesis 7:24,150 days is

00:37:08.381 --> 00:37:11.490
given as the time of the flood.
 

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:14.972
Anything else?
Any other sorts of doublets or

00:37:14.972 --> 00:37:17.950
contradictions,
because there are a few more?

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:23.460
 
 

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.030
Who's giving the instructions?
 

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:28.780
 
 

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:30.958
That's not hard;
you have it right in front of

00:37:30.958 --> 00:37:32.519
you.
Who's giving the instructions?

00:37:32.519 --> 00:37:33.472
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Christine

00:37:33.472 --> 00:37:33.920
Hayes: Okay,
God.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.729
We have the word "God" being
used I guess in that

00:37:35.729 --> 00:37:37.200
translation, right,
with a capital G.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:37.829
What else is used?
 

00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:39.102
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Christine

00:37:39.102 --> 00:37:40.974
Hayes: Lord.
Those are actually different

00:37:40.974 --> 00:37:42.829
Hebrew words underneath there,
okay?

00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:46.358
Those two terms are different
names of the deity that's giving

00:37:46.358 --> 00:37:48.468
the instruction.
Okay, so there are two

00:37:48.468 --> 00:37:49.780
designations used for God.
 

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.535
Yahweh,
which is the sacred

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:53.929
Tetragrammaton,
it's written with four letters

00:37:53.929 --> 00:37:56.110
in Hebrew, they don't include
vowels.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:57.670
We don't really know how it's
pronounced;

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:00.530
I'm guessing at Yahweh,
and that is a proper name for

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:03.554
God, and in your translation
that would be translated as

00:38:03.554 --> 00:38:04.929
"LORD" in small caps.
 

00:38:04.929 --> 00:38:08.466
So wherever you see '"LORD" in
small caps, that's actually the

00:38:08.466 --> 00:38:11.191
English translation for Yahweh,
the proper name,

00:38:11.191 --> 00:38:13.510
like almost a personal name for
God.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:17.380
And then in other places we
have this word Elohim,

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:21.526
which actually is the word for
"gods," a sort of generic term

00:38:21.526 --> 00:38:23.599
for deities in the plural.
 

00:38:23.599 --> 00:38:25.906
However, when it's used to
refer to the God of Israel it's

00:38:25.906 --> 00:38:27.929
clearly singular,
it always has a singular verb.

00:38:27.929 --> 00:38:32.153
So that will be appearing in
your text as "God" with a

00:38:32.153 --> 00:38:34.941
capital G.
So whenever you see "Lord" or

00:38:34.941 --> 00:38:38.478
"God" those are actually
pointing to different words that

00:38:38.478 --> 00:38:41.510
are being used in the underlying
Hebrew text.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:44.179
Twice God is said to look down
on creation.

00:38:44.179 --> 00:38:46.409
Twice it is said that he is
displeased.

00:38:46.409 --> 00:38:49.039
Twice he decides to destroy all
living things.

00:38:49.039 --> 00:38:51.951
Twice he issues instructions
and as we've seen they're

00:38:51.951 --> 00:38:53.895
contradictory.
We seem to also have a

00:38:53.895 --> 00:38:56.219
different account of how long
the flood lasted;

00:38:56.219 --> 00:38:58.941
there are more subtle
contradictions throughout as

00:38:58.941 --> 00:39:01.312
well.
Sometimes the flood seems to be

00:39:01.312 --> 00:39:05.020
the result of very heavy rain,
but in other descriptions it

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.449
seems to be a real cosmic
upheaval.

00:39:07.449 --> 00:39:10.773
You'll remember the description
of the world from Genesis 1 as

00:39:10.773 --> 00:39:13.988
an air bubble essentially that's
formed by separating waters

00:39:13.988 --> 00:39:15.460
above and waters below.
 

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:18.710
They're held back or pressed
back by the firmament above.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:21.015
And it's the windows in the
firmament that are opened--those

00:39:21.015 --> 00:39:23.400
waters are allowed to rush in
and dissolve that air bubble.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.236
It's as if we're back to square
one with the deep,

00:39:26.236 --> 00:39:27.940
right?
Just this watery mass again.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.674
So it's creation undoing itself
in some of the descriptions,

00:39:31.674 --> 00:39:33.699
as opposed to just heavy rain.
 

00:39:33.699 --> 00:39:36.909
And in keeping with that idea
of a kind of a return to chaos,

00:39:36.909 --> 00:39:40.440
Noah is represented in a way as
the beginning of a new creation.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.239
Because like Adam and Eve in
the first creation story,

00:39:43.239 --> 00:39:45.510
Noah is told to be fruitful and
multiply.

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:48.598
He's also given rule over
everything, and that's now

00:39:48.598 --> 00:39:51.019
extended to the taking of human
life .

00:39:51.019 --> 00:39:55.860
The Bible contains a lot of
repetition and contradiction.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:59.596
And sometimes it occurs in one
passage, as in the flood story

00:39:59.596 --> 00:40:03.331
here, and sometimes it occurs in
stories or passages that are

00:40:03.331 --> 00:40:06.548
separate from one another,
for example,

00:40:06.548 --> 00:40:09.469
the two creation stories.
 

00:40:09.469 --> 00:40:12.237
There are many significant
differences between the two

00:40:12.237 --> 00:40:13.230
creation stories.
 

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:15.389
They different greatly in style.
 

00:40:15.389 --> 00:40:18.397
Genesis 1 is formalized,
it's highly structured,

00:40:18.397 --> 00:40:21.659
it has the seven days and
everything's paired up.

00:40:21.659 --> 00:40:24.039
It's beautifully structured,
it's very abstract.

00:40:24.039 --> 00:40:27.349
Genesis 2 is much more
dramatic, much more earthy.

00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:30.304
The first creation story
doesn't really contain puns and

00:40:30.304 --> 00:40:32.400
wordplays, it's a little bit
serious.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.272
The second creation story is
full of them:

00:40:34.272 --> 00:40:37.150
there are all sorts of little
ironies and puns in the Hebrew.

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:39.083
Adam,
the earthling made from the

00:40:39.083 --> 00:40:40.624
earth.
Adam is made from

00:40:40.624 --> 00:40:42.541
adamah.
Adam and Eve are naked,

00:40:42.541 --> 00:40:44.525
arum,
which is the same word for

00:40:44.525 --> 00:40:46.897
clever or shrewd,
and the snake is arum,

00:40:46.897 --> 00:40:49.277
he's clever and shrewd:
there are lots of little puns

00:40:49.277 --> 00:40:51.394
of this kind.
There are also differences in

00:40:51.394 --> 00:40:53.159
terminology between the two
stories.

00:40:53.159 --> 00:40:57.858
Genesis 1 speaks of male and
female, one set of Hebrew terms,

00:40:57.858 --> 00:41:00.599
but Genesis 2 uses man and
woman,

00:41:00.599 --> 00:41:03.170
a different set of Hebrew terms
to describe the genders.

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:06.760
So the terms for gender are
different in the two stories.

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:10.876
Genesis 1 refers to God,
as in your translation "God,"

00:41:10.876 --> 00:41:14.450
Elohim, the word that's
translated as "God."

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:16.599
He's remote, he's transcendent.
 

00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:21.019
He creates effortlessly through
his word and through his will.

00:41:21.019 --> 00:41:24.337
But Genesis 2 refers to the
deity as a name that's really a

00:41:24.337 --> 00:41:27.597
combination, it's Yahweh Elohim,
so you'll see '"Lord God"

00:41:27.597 --> 00:41:29.403
right?
You see that a lot in the Bible

00:41:29.403 --> 00:41:30.159
as well, Lord God.
 

00:41:30.159 --> 00:41:32.159
That tells you both of those
words were side by side in the

00:41:32.159 --> 00:41:34.687
original Hebrew.
So in Genesis 2 the deity is

00:41:34.687 --> 00:41:37.239
Yahweh Elohim.
He's much more down to earth.

00:41:37.239 --> 00:41:39.869
He forms the human like a
potter working with clay.

00:41:39.869 --> 00:41:41.898
He talks to himself,
he plants a garden,

00:41:41.898 --> 00:41:45.070
he takes a stroll in the garden
in the cool of the evening.

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:48.150
He makes clothes for Adam and
Eve.

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:51.721
He's spoken of in much more
anthropomorphic terms then the

00:41:51.721 --> 00:41:54.039
God that we encounter in Genesis
1.

00:41:54.039 --> 00:41:57.398
So what we have in the first
few chapters of Genesis are two

00:41:57.398 --> 00:42:00.130
creation stories that have
distinctive styles,

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:03.004
distinctive themes,
distinctive vocabularies and

00:42:03.004 --> 00:42:04.840
they're placed side by side.
 

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:08.440
In Genesis 6 through 9 we seem
to have two flood stories with

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.505
distinctive styles,
and themes, and vocabularies,

00:42:11.505 --> 00:42:14.867
and substantive details,
but they're interwoven instead

00:42:14.867 --> 00:42:16.860
of being placed side by side.
 

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:19.869
And there are many such
doublets in the Bible.

00:42:19.869 --> 00:42:23.351
At times we have whole books
that repeat or go over the same

00:42:23.351 --> 00:42:25.859
material.
In fact the whole historical

00:42:25.859 --> 00:42:29.378
saga that's recorded from
Genesis through the end of 2

00:42:29.378 --> 00:42:33.097
Kings is rehearsed again in the
books of First and Second

00:42:33.097 --> 00:42:35.991
Chronicles.
What are we to make of the

00:42:35.991 --> 00:42:38.949
repetitions and the
contradictions here and

00:42:38.949 --> 00:42:40.640
throughout the Bible?
 

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.360
What are the implications?
 

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:46.214
Suppose you came across a piece
of writing that you knew nothing

00:42:46.214 --> 00:42:48.539
about just lying there on the
table.

00:42:48.539 --> 00:42:51.080
You didn't know who wrote it,
where, when,

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:54.673
how, why, and someone says to
you, "I want you to draw some

00:42:54.673 --> 00:42:57.400
conclusions about that piece of
writing.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.172
I want you to draw some
conclusions about its authorship

00:43:00.172 --> 00:43:02.340
and the way it was compiled or
composed."

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:05.387
And so you pick it up and you
start reading and you notice

00:43:05.387 --> 00:43:06.510
features like this.
 

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:09.079
What might you conclude?
 

00:43:09.079 --> 00:43:12.100
Throw it out,
what might you conclude?

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.510
No presuppositions.
 

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:15.750
You pick up the work and you
find these features.

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:18.750
What might you conclude about
its authorship or manner of

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:21.511
composition?
Student: There are

00:43:21.511 --> 00:43:22.960
multiple authors.
 

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.748
Professor Christine
Hayes: You might conclude

00:43:24.748 --> 00:43:25.940
that there are multiple authors.
 

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:27.940
Right?
Multiple authorship.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:30.933
Yeah?
Student: There are

00:43:30.933 --> 00:43:32.732
revisions.
Professor Christine

00:43:32.732 --> 00:43:34.636
Hayes: That revisions may
have been made,

00:43:34.636 --> 00:43:36.973
so that you might have
different sources that have been

00:43:36.973 --> 00:43:38.747
revised or put together in
different ways.

00:43:38.747 --> 00:43:40.893
Right?
Revisions implying that you've

00:43:40.893 --> 00:43:43.269
got something and then it's
worked over again,

00:43:43.269 --> 00:43:46.119
additions might be made so now
that's a new source.

00:43:46.119 --> 00:43:49.243
You might conclude that these
features are evidence of

00:43:49.243 --> 00:43:52.154
multiple authorship;
a good deal of revision which

00:43:52.154 --> 00:43:54.715
points itself to a kind of
composite structure,

00:43:54.715 --> 00:43:57.219
different layers maybe,
different sources.

00:43:57.219 --> 00:44:00.260
Well as early as the Middle
Ages there were some scholars

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.920
who noticed these things in the
biblical texts.

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:05.465
They noticed that there are
contradictions and repetitions

00:44:05.465 --> 00:44:08.424
and there are anachronisms too,
other features that were

00:44:08.424 --> 00:44:11.825
evidence of multiple authorship,
revisions and composite

00:44:11.825 --> 00:44:14.781
structure.
So what?

00:44:14.781 --> 00:44:22.849
Why would that be a big deal?
 

00:44:22.849 --> 00:44:26.165
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Christine

00:44:26.165 --> 00:44:29.277
Hayes: Okay,
it could be a bit of a problem

00:44:29.277 --> 00:44:33.201
if this text has become the
basis for a system of religious

00:44:33.201 --> 00:44:36.099
faith or belief,
and your assumptions about it

00:44:36.099 --> 00:44:38.869
are that its telling a truth
that is singular in nature.

00:44:38.869 --> 00:44:41.927
And also what about the
traditional beliefs on the

00:44:41.927 --> 00:44:43.300
origin of this text?
 

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.441
Right, who wrote this text
according to traditional

00:44:45.441 --> 00:44:45.870
beliefs?
 

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:49.429
 
 

00:44:49.429 --> 00:44:50.812
I'm hearing Moses,
I'm hearing God,

00:44:50.812 --> 00:44:52.519
I'm hearing a bunch of
different things,

00:44:52.519 --> 00:44:56.400
but there are traditional ideas
about generally the Mosaic

00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.072
authorship of the Bible,
certainly the first five books

00:45:00.072 --> 00:45:02.385
of the Bible.
And so these features of the

00:45:02.385 --> 00:45:05.134
text which were noticed were a
challenge to traditional

00:45:05.134 --> 00:45:08.138
religious convictions regarding
the Mosaic authorship of the

00:45:08.138 --> 00:45:11.592
first five books of the Bible,
and in many ways the perfection

00:45:11.592 --> 00:45:13.696
of the Bible,
as speaking with a unified

00:45:13.696 --> 00:45:16.610
voice on matters of doctrine or
religious theology.

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:20.378
So medieval commentators for
example began to speak a little

00:45:20.378 --> 00:45:23.380
bit more openly about some of
these features.

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:27.121
One of the first things they
noticed is that Deuteronomy 34

00:45:27.121 --> 00:45:29.829
describes the death and burial
of Moses.

00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:33.731
So they decided it was possible
that Moses didn't write at least

00:45:33.731 --> 00:45:35.726
that chapter.
Similarly there are some

00:45:35.726 --> 00:45:37.460
anachronisms that they had to
explain.

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:41.199
One of the most famous is in
Genesis 13:7.

00:45:41.199 --> 00:45:44.132
It's in the midst of a story
about dividing the land between

00:45:44.132 --> 00:45:46.269
Lot and--at that time his name
was Abram,

00:45:46.269 --> 00:45:48.820
it later becomes Abraham--but
between Lot and Abram.

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:51.922
And the narrator in telling
this story sort of interjects

00:45:51.922 --> 00:45:53.639
and turns to us,
the readers,

00:45:53.639 --> 00:45:57.809
and says, "The Canaanites and
Perrizites were then dwelling in

00:45:57.809 --> 00:46:00.476
the land."
Now what's weird about that

00:46:00.476 --> 00:46:02.710
sentence?
The narrator is speaking to us

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:05.554
from a time in which the
Canaanites and Perrizites don't

00:46:05.554 --> 00:46:06.949
live in the land,
right?

00:46:06.949 --> 00:46:11.469
"That's back when the Native
Americans lived in Connecticut."

00:46:11.469 --> 00:46:13.628
Is that writer living at a time
when Native Americans are still

00:46:13.628 --> 00:46:15.230
living in Connecticut or owning
Connecticut?

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:16.608
No.
They're writing from a later

00:46:16.608 --> 00:46:18.642
point of view.
So the narrator breaks and

00:46:18.642 --> 00:46:20.981
talks to the audience in Genesis
13:7 and says,

00:46:20.981 --> 00:46:23.880
"That was back in the time when
the Canaanites were in the

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.418
land."
When did Moses live?

00:46:25.418 --> 00:46:27.570
Who lived in the land in the
time of Moses?

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:29.680
The Canaanites.
I know you haven't gotten there

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:31.704
yet, but when you get to
Deuteronomy you're going to find

00:46:31.704 --> 00:46:33.150
out he doesn't make it into the
land.

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:35.802
So he never makes it in there,
he never gets in before the

00:46:35.802 --> 00:46:36.780
Israelites conquer.
 

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:39.150
He dies--the Canaanites are
still in possession.

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:42.250
So that line was certainly
written not by Moses;

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:44.907
it was written by someone at a
much later time who's looking

00:46:44.907 --> 00:46:47.654
back and referring to the time
when the Canaanites were in the

00:46:47.654 --> 00:46:49.256
land.
So these are the kinds of

00:46:49.256 --> 00:46:50.980
things that people began to
notice.

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.453
And with the rise of
rationalism in the modern

00:46:53.453 --> 00:46:56.860
period, traditional notions of
the divine and Mosaic authorship

00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:59.984
of the Pentateuch,
the Torah, the first five books

00:46:59.984 --> 00:47:02.269
of Moses, were called into
question.

00:47:02.269 --> 00:47:06.102
The modern critical study of
the Bible begins really with

00:47:06.102 --> 00:47:09.729
Spinoza who in the early
seventeenth century suggested

00:47:09.729 --> 00:47:13.766
that the Bible should be studied
and examined like any book:

00:47:13.766 --> 00:47:17.804
without presuppositions about
its divine origin or any other

00:47:17.804 --> 00:47:21.909
dogmatic claims about its
composition or authorship.

00:47:21.909 --> 00:47:25.132
But it was a Catholic priest,
Richard Simon,

00:47:25.132 --> 00:47:28.878
who first argued that Moses
didn't write the Torah,

00:47:28.878 --> 00:47:33.000
and that it contained many
anachronisms and errors.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.770
Well we've run out of time,
but I'll pick up this

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:39.118
fascinating story on Wednesday
and we'll learn a little bit

00:47:39.118 --> 00:47:42.869
more about critical ideas about
the composition of the Bible.

00:47:42.869 --> 00:47:45.970
Please be on the look out for
emails from section leaders with

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:49.019
study guides for sections which
will be meeting this week;

00:47:49.019 --> 00:47:52.000
you'll have a lot of fun with
the creation stories.

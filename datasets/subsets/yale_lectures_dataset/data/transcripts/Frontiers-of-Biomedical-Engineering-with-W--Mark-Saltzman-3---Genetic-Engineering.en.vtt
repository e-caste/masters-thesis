00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.992
Professor Mark Saltzman:
This week we're going to

00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:18.818
talk about DNA technology and
genetic engineering:

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:22.535
this is Chapter 3 of the book.
Some of this will be familiar

00:00:22.535 --> 00:00:26.228
to some of you who've have had
biology in high school or other

00:00:26.228 --> 00:00:28.650
places, you know something about
DNA.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.625
In fact, even if you haven't
had a biology class it's hard to

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:36.070
be alive in 2008 and not know
something about DNA;

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.160
it's become such an important
part of our lives.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.865
I'm going to ask you to indulge
me while I go back to the

00:00:44.865 --> 00:00:48.638
beginning and talk about some
things that you know but I'm

00:00:48.638 --> 00:00:51.550
going to go through this pretty
rapidly.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.730
I think the book has a fairly
good description of it so if you

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.920
don't pick up everything in the
lecture,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.788
hopefully you've read that
beforehand, and you can go back

00:00:59.788 --> 00:01:03.009
to it afterwards and read about
things that didn't make sense.

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:04.800
We'll talk about some
chemistry today,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.376
what DNA molecules are like,
why they have the behavior that

00:01:07.376 --> 00:01:09.553
they do,
and you need to understand this

00:01:09.553 --> 00:01:12.060
in order to understand how you
manipulate DNA.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.166
So my goal today is to talk
about sort of the basics of the

00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:20.901
molecules, their chemistry,
the function of DNA in cells,

00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:24.599
sort of basic - the basic side
of that.

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:29.254
Then on Thursday we're going to
start talking about how to

00:01:29.254 --> 00:01:33.663
manipulate DNA and get closer to
using it in Biomedical

00:01:33.663 --> 00:01:36.585
Engineering.
DNA is a double helix,

00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:39.007
you know this,
the double helix was--the

00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:42.797
structure of DNA was discovered
about the time that I was born

00:01:42.797 --> 00:01:46.090
and so it's been known
throughout your lifetime,

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.309
you've always lived with it.
It's really remarkable how

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:53.254
far--how fast we have come from
just knowing the structure of

00:01:53.254 --> 00:01:56.936
this molecule to be able to
manipulate it and study it in

00:01:56.936 --> 00:01:59.608
great detail.
I want to start by showing you

00:01:59.608 --> 00:02:02.636
this cartoon that you already
know about with the structure of

00:02:02.636 --> 00:02:04.981
a double helix.
It's a twisted ladder and

00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:08.175
there's a couple of things to
notice about this familiar

00:02:08.175 --> 00:02:10.801
structure.
One is that there are two

00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:15.217
backbones right here in the
light blue, so this would be the

00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:18.810
upright parts of the ladder that
are twisted.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.817
Those are two continuous
strands that wind around each

00:02:21.817 --> 00:02:25.306
other to form the double helix.
One thing to notice is this

00:02:25.306 --> 00:02:28.599
part of the double helix that
we'll call the backbone.

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.495
The backbone's on the outside
of the molecule like the upright

00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:35.560
struts of a ladder on the
outside of a ladder.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.855
On the inside are the rungs or
the struts that hold the ladder

00:02:39.855 --> 00:02:42.054
together.
There are several things

00:02:42.054 --> 00:02:44.750
that you'll notice about the
struts in this particular

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.892
cartoon.
One is that there's four

00:02:46.892 --> 00:02:49.860
different colors and so you can
see red, blue,

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.964
yellow,
green here - four different

00:02:51.964 --> 00:02:55.280
colors and that's all there are,
there aren't more than four.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.433
That there are two colors per
strut, so what's linking the two

00:02:58.433 --> 00:03:01.380
backbones together are two
colored segments that come from

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.300
the outside towards the middle,
and that the colors occur only

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.973
in certain combinations,
red and green,

00:03:07.973 --> 00:03:10.669
yellow and blue,
that's all you see.

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:13.689
You don't see a red and yellow,
you don't see green and blue.

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:19.082
This is a feature of DNA
shown in this cartoon form,

00:03:19.082 --> 00:03:24.180
so if you can keep that sort of
schematic in mind,

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.575
it makes it a lot easier to
understand the detailed

00:03:27.575 --> 00:03:29.904
structure.
That's what I want to do for

00:03:29.904 --> 00:03:32.826
the first few minutes of the
lecture here is tell you a

00:03:32.826 --> 00:03:36.180
little bit about the details of
the structure and how molecules

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.264
fit into this image of DNA
that's already very familiar to

00:03:39.264 --> 00:03:40.933
you.
The things that you need to

00:03:40.933 --> 00:03:43.240
know are the things that are
really listed on this slide.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.264
You're going to know more
details about it,

00:03:46.264 --> 00:03:49.433
they're not really colors,
they're chemicals,

00:03:49.433 --> 00:03:53.250
specific chemicals - but the
pattern is the same.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.090
The molecules that really
make up DNA are nucleotides and

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.705
DNA is a polymer of nucleotides.
A polymer is just a large

00:04:03.705 --> 00:04:05.949
molecule that's made up of
repeated units.

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:10.860
We're familiar with polymers,
plastics in our daily life;

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.489
the chairs that you're sitting
on are made of a kind of a

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.789
plastic polymer that is
basically an organic chemical

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:24.611
that is cross-linked together.
Cross-linked is not the right

00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:28.910
word--that is chemically bonded
with repeat units to make large

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.863
molecules so that when you have
a bunch of large molecules

00:04:32.863 --> 00:04:36.608
together they have certain
physical properties like the

00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:40.769
solid property of the plastic
that you're sitting on.

00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:44.358
Nucleic acids,
of which DNA is an example,

00:04:44.358 --> 00:04:49.892
are polymers of nucleotides.
So the repeating unit in DNA is

00:04:49.892 --> 00:04:53.238
this structure here,
a nucleotide,

00:04:53.238 --> 00:04:56.990
which has three different
regions.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.884
There's a sugar,
a five carbon sugar,

00:04:59.884 --> 00:05:04.547
which forms the core of the
nucleotide and attached to this

00:05:04.547 --> 00:05:09.371
five carbon sugar at specific
positions on the sugar relative

00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:14.222
to this oxygen,
which is part of the sugar

00:05:14.222 --> 00:05:20.060
ring, is a phosphate group and
an organic base.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.490
When these nucleotides get
polymerized to form a long DNA

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.675
molecule they all get
polymerized in exactly the same

00:05:26.675 --> 00:05:30.553
way, the chemistry is the same.
The phosphate group of one

00:05:30.553 --> 00:05:33.955
nucleotide gets linked to the
sugar group of another

00:05:33.955 --> 00:05:38.089
nucleotide and I'm going to show
you that in a few minutes.

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:42.456
So what's going to form the
backbone is this continual link,

00:05:42.456 --> 00:05:45.226
phosphate to sugar,
phosphate to sugar,

00:05:45.226 --> 00:05:48.427
phosphate to sugar,
all linked together to form one

00:05:48.427 --> 00:05:51.259
long,
long molecule.

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:56.080
What's hanging off of the side
of this long molecule that's

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.402
formed by polymerizing
nucleotides are - is this base

00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:03.566
unit.
It's the phosphate and the

00:06:03.566 --> 00:06:07.673
pentose that make up the
backbone - that make up the

00:06:07.673 --> 00:06:12.747
upright struts of the ladder and
it's the bases that make up the

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:17.829
connecting struts,
so the bases are the colors.

00:06:17.829 --> 00:06:21.629
There are four different bases,
which I'll talk about in a

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:24.083
moment.
We're going to talk about two

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:27.533
different nucleic acid
molecules, two different nucleic

00:06:27.533 --> 00:06:30.622
acid polymers,
one is DNA, deoxyribonucleic

00:06:30.622 --> 00:06:34.483
acid, the other is RNA,
ribonucleic acid and one of the

00:06:34.483 --> 00:06:38.129
differences between the two is
that the pentose,

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:40.840
or the sugar,
that makes up DNA is

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.111
deoxyribose shown here,
and the pentose that makes up

00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:50.699
RNA is ribose,
shown here so every pentose in

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:57.092
a DNA polymer is deoxyribose.
The phosphate is linked to this

00:06:57.092 --> 00:07:00.626
carbon on the pentose,
and notice that there is a

00:07:00.626 --> 00:07:04.086
number on this carbon,
it's called - it's the 5'

00:07:04.086 --> 00:07:06.374
carbon.
This is a convention that

00:07:06.374 --> 00:07:09.409
organic chemist's use when
they're describing molecules

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:11.901
like this.
They'd like to be able to refer

00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:15.139
to each carbon separately so
they can talk about reactions

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:17.980
with this molecule,
so they number the carbons.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.778
In this case,
these pentose molecules,

00:07:20.778 --> 00:07:24.559
whether it's ribose or
deoxyribose, the carbons are

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:27.676
numbered the same 1',
2', 3', 4', 5',

00:07:27.676 --> 00:07:32.009
those are the five carbons that
make up the pentose.

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:35.134
So I could refer to the 4'
carbon and you'd know I'd mean

00:07:35.134 --> 00:07:38.259
this one, or the 2' carbon you'd
know I mean this one.

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:41.588
The ones that are important to
us are the 3' carbon and the 5'

00:07:41.588 --> 00:07:44.298
carbon.
The reason for that is that the

00:07:44.298 --> 00:07:47.589
5' carbon is where the phosphate
is attached.

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:52.574
In nucleotide the phosphate is
always attached to the 5'

00:07:52.574 --> 00:07:55.838
carbon.
The reason that 3' is important

00:07:55.838 --> 00:08:00.814
is that when you polymerize two
nucleotides together and a third

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:03.064
nucleotide,
and a fourth nucleotide,

00:08:03.064 --> 00:08:06.069
when you polymerize nucleotides
together they get polymerized,

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:11.588
the phosphate of one gets
linked to the 3' carbon of

00:08:11.588 --> 00:08:14.927
another.
This is important because this

00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:16.883
molecule here,
deoxyribose,

00:08:16.883 --> 00:08:21.246
is not the same upside down as
it is - it's not symmetrical

00:08:21.246 --> 00:08:25.890
upside down and right side up,
it's different because the 5'

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.939
carbon's either pointed up or
pointed down.

00:08:28.939 --> 00:08:31.478
The nucleotide has a
directionality,

00:08:31.478 --> 00:08:35.830
there's an up and a down to it
and it's going to turn out the

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.167
chain that's formed by
polymerizing these has a

00:08:39.167 --> 00:08:43.374
directionality as well and
that's important in defining the

00:08:43.374 --> 00:08:46.759
structure.
These are the pentoses -

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:52.220
remember 5' and 3' because that
orients you with respect to what

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.340
direction the molecule is
facing.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.115
Now the bases,
and you don't need to memorize

00:08:58.115 --> 00:09:01.528
the structures of these I'm
going - I'm describing the whole

00:09:01.528 --> 00:09:05.113
molecule to you in its molecular
detail and then we're going to

00:09:05.113 --> 00:09:08.352
simplify it down to a version
that we can talk about more

00:09:08.352 --> 00:09:11.409
easily.
To give you all the detail,

00:09:11.409 --> 00:09:15.220
there's two classes of bases
that appear here.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.737
One class is called the purines
and they have two ring-like

00:09:19.737 --> 00:09:22.485
structures.
There are two of them that are

00:09:22.485 --> 00:09:25.899
going to be important to us,
one is adenine and the other is

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:29.250
guanine, shown here.
Because saying adenine takes a

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.292
long time and saying guanine
takes a long time we're going to

00:09:33.292 --> 00:09:36.929
simplify it by calling adenine
(A) and guanine (G).

00:09:36.929 --> 00:09:40.223
The second class is the
pyrimidines and there's three of

00:09:40.223 --> 00:09:43.879
those that are important;
uracil, thymine and cytosine

00:09:43.879 --> 00:09:47.157
which we're going too simplify
by calling (U),

00:09:47.157 --> 00:09:50.236
(T) and (C).
Now remember that there

00:09:50.236 --> 00:09:54.870
were only four different colors
in the cartoon of the DNA double

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:59.431
helix that we talked about and I
told you that those colors are

00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:04.139
really - represent the bases but
there's five of them here.

00:10:04.139 --> 00:10:07.279
There's five because there's
one of these that's particular

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:10.309
to RNA only, that appears in
only RNA, and there's one of

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:14.379
them that appears in only DNA.
The one that appears only in

00:10:14.379 --> 00:10:18.600
RNA is (U), the one that appears
only in DNA is (T).

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.756
In DNA there's only four
colors, there's only four bases,

00:10:22.756 --> 00:10:27.620
(C)(T)(G)(A).
In RNA there's four bases

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.746
(A)(G)(U)(C).
So (U) and (T) are

00:10:31.746 --> 00:10:38.276
interchangeable in a sense that
(U) appears where (T) would

00:10:38.276 --> 00:10:45.370
appear in RNA and (T) appears
where (U) would appear in DNA.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:49.065
If I drew this altogether
and this is one particular

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.820
nucleic acid,
now shown in more detail,

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.925
all of the carbons of the
pentose are shown here,

00:10:55.925 --> 00:10:59.860
the phosphate is shown,
and a base is shown.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:05.070
This particular base is (A),
this is ribose.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.980
So this is a monomer or a
single unit from an RNA

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.314
molecule, you know that because
it's ribose and it's the

00:11:11.314 --> 00:11:14.770
particular molecule that has (A)
as its organic base.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.524
We don't need to really talk
about all the molecular detail

00:11:22.524 --> 00:11:26.678
in order to completely describe
a DNA or an RNA molecule because

00:11:26.678 --> 00:11:29.250
these structures repeat
themselves.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:34.721
Every unit in the backbone of
this ladder has the same sugar

00:11:34.721 --> 00:11:38.980
unit, the same pentose;
it's either RNA or DNA and has

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:42.280
ribose or deoxyribose,
so you don't need to describe

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.891
the whole thing.
You can just say it's RNA or

00:11:44.891 --> 00:11:47.506
DNA and you know everything
about the pentose in every

00:11:47.506 --> 00:11:50.591
molecule on the chain.
You don't need to say anything

00:11:50.591 --> 00:11:54.481
more about the phosphate because
they all have the phosphate and

00:11:54.481 --> 00:11:58.000
every set of these is hooked
together in the same way.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.200
The 5' carbon has a phosphate
off of it and that phosphate is

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.259
linked to the 3' carbon of the
next one and they all have a

00:12:06.259 --> 00:12:10.029
base hanging off the side.
The only thing I need to say in

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:13.098
order to distinguish this
particular part of the chemistry

00:12:13.098 --> 00:12:16.490
of a DNA or an RNA molecule is
to say 'it's DNA or its RNA',

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:20.696
and 'what the base is'.
If I told you that 'draw me a

00:12:20.696 --> 00:12:24.940
nucleotide from RNA that has
(A)', you could go back to this

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.250
picture and you could draw the
whole thing.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:30.440
You can just talk about it in a
simpler way.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.752
You can say a polymer of DNA,
for example,

00:12:34.752 --> 00:12:40.011
is four bases long,
that means it has four of these

00:12:40.011 --> 00:12:45.901
repeat units and they go in the
sequence from 5' to 3' of

00:12:45.901 --> 00:12:50.061
(A)(G)(T)(G).
If I told you that a DNA

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:54.835
sequence went 5' to 3'
(A)(G)(T)(G) you could draw the

00:12:54.835 --> 00:12:59.519
whole thing referring back to
these notes, right?

00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:02.807
In fact, you don't have to draw
it this complicated way,

00:13:02.807 --> 00:13:06.035
you could just draw it as a
line with (A)(G)(T) and (G)

00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:10.088
hanging off of it,
and you would know that that's

00:13:10.088 --> 00:13:14.046
a DNA molecule four bases long.
Now what does the line

00:13:14.046 --> 00:13:16.365
represent here?
This represents the upright

00:13:16.365 --> 00:13:19.961
struts on a ladder that I showed
you before, it represents this

00:13:19.961 --> 00:13:23.150
backbone that's shown by -
that's formed by polymerizing

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.630
the pentose's together through
phosphate's always going 5' to

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.289
3',
5' to 3'.

00:13:28.289 --> 00:13:31.606
I could take and draw a line
continually down the molecule

00:13:31.606 --> 00:13:35.887
where my finger was touching;
my finger would be touching a

00:13:35.887 --> 00:13:38.365
phosphate here,
the 5' carbon,

00:13:38.365 --> 00:13:40.757
the 4' carbon,
the 3' carbon,

00:13:40.757 --> 00:13:45.210
and the next phosphate.
The backbone is what?

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.248
It's phosphate,
carbon, carbon,

00:13:47.248 --> 00:13:49.491
carbon, phosphate,
carbon, carbon,

00:13:49.491 --> 00:13:53.432
carbon, phosphate and it has
this structure hanging off the

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:56.098
side.
Now DNA is a double helix

00:13:56.098 --> 00:13:59.074
and I've only shown you one part
of the helix,

00:13:59.074 --> 00:14:01.203
right?
I've shown you one upright

00:14:01.203 --> 00:14:04.861
strut and a base hanging off of
it, but it forms a double helix

00:14:04.861 --> 00:14:08.578
because complementary strands of
DNA strongly associate with one

00:14:08.578 --> 00:14:11.409
another and that's a very stable
structure.

00:14:11.409 --> 00:14:15.366
They do that because the bases
can interact with one another in

00:14:15.366 --> 00:14:18.110
particular ways,
and this you know about.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:22.483
This was the famous finding of
Watson and Crick in describing

00:14:22.483 --> 00:14:26.594
the structure of DNA.
This is - what this diagram

00:14:26.594 --> 00:14:32.094
shows you is--the forces that
hold these individual strands of

00:14:32.094 --> 00:14:37.474
DNA into a double stranded form.
The forces occur because of

00:14:37.474 --> 00:14:42.088
hydrogen bonding between
complementary pairs of the bases

00:14:42.088 --> 00:14:46.620
and the complementary pairs are
adenine and thymine,

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.080
(A) and (T) and guanine and
cytosine, (G) and (C).

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.602
Now if you read in the
book, you read about where this

00:14:53.602 --> 00:14:56.852
figure is shown in the book,
you can understand more about

00:14:56.852 --> 00:15:00.962
why these structures line up in
the right way so that the right

00:15:00.962 --> 00:15:05.006
molecular elements are together
to form hydrogen bonding pairs

00:15:05.006 --> 00:15:08.309
between them.
That's really beyond what I'll

00:15:08.309 --> 00:15:12.599
be asking you understand for the
course but you can understand

00:15:12.599 --> 00:15:14.919
that if you read it,
I'm sure.

00:15:14.919 --> 00:15:20.554
Now remember that (T) only
appears in DNA and (U) appears

00:15:20.554 --> 00:15:26.188
in RNA, and so (U) can also form
a hydrogen binding pair with

00:15:26.188 --> 00:15:28.457
(A).
The whole structure of a DNA

00:15:28.457 --> 00:15:31.331
molecule looks like this,
going back to a more cartoon

00:15:31.331 --> 00:15:34.692
version like I showed you before
but adding some detail onto it

00:15:34.692 --> 00:15:36.926
now.
There are two upright struts of

00:15:36.926 --> 00:15:40.250
the ladder, one shown in blue
here, the other shown black.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:44.777
They are linked together by
four different colored segments

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:48.679
indicated here not by colors now
but by letters.

00:15:48.679 --> 00:15:54.220
It's DNA, so it's (G)(C)(A)(T)
and they always occur in pairs.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:59.058
Where before it was two colored
pairs now it's two lettered

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:04.110
pairs (G)(C)(T)(A).
The chains are different

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.118
now.
They were colored the same,

00:16:06.118 --> 00:16:08.850
the backbones were colored the
same in the diagram.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.584
They're colored different here
to indicate one new difference

00:16:11.584 --> 00:16:14.263
that you know about now,
and that's that there is an

00:16:14.263 --> 00:16:17.029
orientation, there's an up and
down on the chain.

00:16:17.029 --> 00:16:20.043
That's due to the asymmetry of
the nucleotide,

00:16:20.043 --> 00:16:24.129
that there's a 5' and a 3' end
and the way that they're linked

00:16:24.129 --> 00:16:27.058
together.
This blue chain here goes from

00:16:27.058 --> 00:16:30.970
5' carbon all along the chain
and there's a 3' carbon left

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:32.480
open at the bottom.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.779
If I wanted to link another
nucleotide to this DNA chain

00:16:38.779 --> 00:16:41.009
what would I attach here on the
bottom?

00:16:41.009 --> 00:16:46.384
I would attach the phosphate
that's connected to the 5'

00:16:46.384 --> 00:16:53.333
carbon of another nucleotide.
I would link this one facing in

00:16:53.333 --> 00:16:58.070
this direction I would add onto
this.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.392
The other chain is facing in
the other direction,

00:17:00.392 --> 00:17:02.570
the 3' carbon is up,
the 5' carbon is down.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:10.869
Remember that this molecule,
let's look at the blue one

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:15.240
wouldn't be the same if I turned
it upside down.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.621
It wouldn't be the same if I
turned it upside down because

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:22.128
the carbons - the rings here,
the pentose's would all be

00:17:22.128 --> 00:17:26.172
turned over, the chemistry would
look different and the sequence

00:17:26.172 --> 00:17:28.290
of bases would look different.

00:17:31.799 --> 00:17:37.291
The corresponding half of
the ladder that corresponds to

00:17:37.291 --> 00:17:41.015
any given ladder,
let's say the black DNA

00:17:41.015 --> 00:17:46.693
molecule that corresponds to the
blue one is not just a mirror

00:17:46.693 --> 00:17:50.420
image.
We call it the complement and

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:54.650
each strand of DNA,
each polymer of DNA that you

00:17:54.650 --> 00:18:00.049
could make or you could draw has
only one complement and that

00:18:00.049 --> 00:18:03.920
complement has the following
features.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:08.629
One, its chain is oriented in
the opposite direction:

00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:13.609
where this one goes 5' to 3',
this one goes 3' to 5'.

00:18:13.609 --> 00:18:17.539
It's oriented in the oppose
direction and it has the

00:18:17.539 --> 00:18:20.930
complementary base pairs at each
position.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:23.459
Where there's an (A) here
there's got to be a (T) here,

00:18:23.459 --> 00:18:26.130
where there's a (T) here
there's got to be an (A) here,

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.670
where there's a (C) here a (G),
a (G), a (C).

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:32.744
That's because you have to
satisfy this base pair matching

00:18:32.744 --> 00:18:35.819
in order to have hydrogen
bonding in each of the struts of

00:18:35.819 --> 00:18:38.570
the ladder in order to form a
stable structure.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:45.128
If I'm talking about two
DNA strands and they differ only

00:18:45.128 --> 00:18:48.274
in one or two base pairs they
won't be exact complements and

00:18:48.274 --> 00:18:50.300
they won't form this double
helix.

00:18:54.769 --> 00:18:59.230
This notion of complementary
strands is very important.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:04.009
It's the way that DNA exists
inside the cells of your body.

00:19:04.009 --> 00:19:06.803
It exists in a double stranded
form where every strand is

00:19:06.803 --> 00:19:10.551
matched by its complement.
These molecules of DNA,

00:19:10.551 --> 00:19:15.970
very long molecules of DNA,
are condensed and packaged

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:20.980
within the nucleus of every cell
in your body.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:24.700
Every cell in your body has
exactly the same DNA;

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.903
that is if I could stretch out
all the DNA and look at the base

00:19:27.903 --> 00:19:31.080
pair sequence,
the sequences of bases along

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:36.284
all the DNA in your chromosomes,
they'd be identical in all the

00:19:36.284 --> 00:19:39.027
cells.
They'd be different in each of

00:19:39.027 --> 00:19:42.407
us and that leads to the
difference in the diversity

00:19:42.407 --> 00:19:45.400
between people.
You've heard about the human

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.294
genome project,
we'll talk about that a little

00:19:48.294 --> 00:19:50.966
bit later.
The goal of that was to take

00:19:50.966 --> 00:19:54.245
for a typical human,
or for a typical - in the case

00:19:54.245 --> 00:19:57.918
of the human genome project
maybe you're looking at fruit

00:19:57.918 --> 00:20:00.728
flies,
you want to look at all the DNA

00:20:00.728 --> 00:20:03.760
in a fruit fly,
but to look at the sequence of

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.870
base pairs that makes up human
DNA and write them all out;

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:10.839
we'll talk about that later.
This slide shows one

00:20:10.839 --> 00:20:13.875
important feature of the
physical chemistry of DNA that

00:20:13.875 --> 00:20:17.249
turns out to be very important
for all of the technology that

00:20:17.249 --> 00:20:21.606
is built on DNA.
It has to do with the nature of

00:20:21.606 --> 00:20:27.445
this complementary binding
between double stranded DNA and

00:20:27.445 --> 00:20:33.593
the fidelity of this base pair
matching in forming stable DNA

00:20:33.593 --> 00:20:37.144
molecules.
I told you that the fidelity is

00:20:37.144 --> 00:20:38.750
very high.
What does that mean?

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:42.581
That only strands that have
this exact complement can form

00:20:42.581 --> 00:20:46.529
double stranded DNA.
Because of that you can do

00:20:46.529 --> 00:20:51.140
the following experiment,
and it's a simple experiment,

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.427
it's simple to understand,
but the concept is very

00:20:53.427 --> 00:20:56.369
important so I encourage you to
think about it and make sure you

00:20:56.369 --> 00:20:59.499
understand it.
If I took two double stranded

00:20:59.499 --> 00:21:04.078
DNA molecules and I exposed them
to certain conditions that

00:21:04.078 --> 00:21:10.120
caused them to denature,
that means its native structure

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.447
falls apart.
The native structure is this

00:21:13.447 --> 00:21:17.184
double stranded structure here
and if I heat it up slightly and

00:21:17.184 --> 00:21:19.759
I add some base,
so under slightly basic

00:21:19.759 --> 00:21:23.303
conditions, these molecules will
fall apart because you've

00:21:23.303 --> 00:21:26.846
created conditions where the
hydrogen bonding is no longer

00:21:26.846 --> 00:21:30.632
favorable so they peel apart.
If I had a beaker sitting on

00:21:30.632 --> 00:21:34.277
the table here and it contained
a million blue double stranded

00:21:34.277 --> 00:21:37.862
DNA molecules and a million red
double stranded DNA molecules

00:21:37.862 --> 00:21:40.730
and I heated it up and added a
little base,

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:43.874
I'd soon have four million
individual strands just floating

00:21:43.874 --> 00:21:47.019
around in the solution because
I've broken up this hydrogen

00:21:47.019 --> 00:21:49.460
bonding and the DNA molecules
fall apart.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:55.081
That's called denaturing DNA.
That tells you something about

00:21:55.081 --> 00:21:56.869
the physical chemistry of the
molecule;

00:21:56.869 --> 00:22:01.586
that it's these hydrogen bonds
that hold the double strands and

00:22:01.586 --> 00:22:05.390
I can break those down under
certain conditions.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:09.008
If I then put it back into
its original condition,

00:22:09.008 --> 00:22:11.943
lower the heat say,
temperature back to body

00:22:11.943 --> 00:22:15.630
temperature and reduce the pH
down to seven again,

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:19.978
the molecules will re-nature.
They will reform their natural

00:22:19.978 --> 00:22:23.940
structure, and for DNA that
means forming double helixes.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:27.928
But they will do that in a very
particular way,

00:22:27.928 --> 00:22:32.611
in that only strands that
exactly match will be able to

00:22:32.611 --> 00:22:38.329
reform their native structure.
A blue strand here will never

00:22:38.329 --> 00:22:43.676
re-nature with a red strand
because their sequences don't

00:22:43.676 --> 00:22:45.300
match exactly,

00:22:48.839 --> 00:22:53.021
but a complementary blue strand
will always rematch with its

00:22:53.021 --> 00:22:56.229
partner.
Now this is the basis of a

00:22:56.229 --> 00:23:00.940
physical chemistry process
called hybridization.

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:05.915
It turns out that this is how
we can identify specific DNA

00:23:05.915 --> 00:23:11.240
sequences and how we can do
things like DNA fingerprinting,

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:15.981
how we can clone molecules,
DNA molecules from one organism

00:23:15.981 --> 00:23:21.131
to another, rely very heavily on
this principle of re-naturation

00:23:21.131 --> 00:23:25.848
and hybridization.
Hybridization simply means that

00:23:25.848 --> 00:23:31.310
DNA will re-nature and form a
stable double helix only with

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:36.189
its particular match,
only with the hybrid that it is

00:23:36.189 --> 00:23:38.640
perfectly complementary too.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:47.188
That's something about the
physical chemistry of DNA,

00:23:47.188 --> 00:23:50.298
what it looks like,
and how it behaves in the

00:23:50.298 --> 00:23:53.538
simple sense.
What I want to spend the rest

00:23:53.538 --> 00:23:57.474
of the time doing is talking
about some of the biological

00:23:57.474 --> 00:24:00.708
properties of DNA.
Again, I know this is something

00:24:00.708 --> 00:24:04.113
that's familiar to most of you
and so indulge me just for the

00:24:04.113 --> 00:24:06.609
rest of this lecture,
I'll go through it.

00:24:06.609 --> 00:24:09.364
I want to try to hit the points
that I think are important to

00:24:09.364 --> 00:24:11.981
remember because they're going
to be concepts that come up

00:24:11.981 --> 00:24:13.910
again and again throughout the
course,

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:16.960
and I want to make sure that
we're on the same page.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.032
This diagram at the top
here is a very familiar one to

00:24:20.032 --> 00:24:22.943
most of you, it's sometimes
called the central dogma of

00:24:22.943 --> 00:24:26.096
molecular biology.
It indicates how information

00:24:26.096 --> 00:24:30.309
flows in cells and indicates a
lot about the work that a cell

00:24:30.309 --> 00:24:33.470
does in maintaining and
recreating itself,

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:36.991
and maintaining its environment.
That is, that the information

00:24:36.991 --> 00:24:40.039
needed to operate a cell is
stored in its DNA.

00:24:40.039 --> 00:24:43.940
That information gets put into
action through a process,

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.059
a biological process called
transcription,

00:24:47.059 --> 00:24:51.359
where particular regions of DNA
are transcribed into RNA.

00:24:51.359 --> 00:24:56.044
That RNA is made into proteins,
and proteins are the working

00:24:56.044 --> 00:24:58.706
molecules of the cell,
they're enzymes,

00:24:58.706 --> 00:25:01.541
they're structural molecules,
they're are proteins that exist

00:25:01.541 --> 00:25:04.187
in the membrane that allow
things to go in and out of the

00:25:04.187 --> 00:25:06.752
cell,
so really the working molecules

00:25:06.752 --> 00:25:11.427
are the cell in every sense.
RNA is converted into protein

00:25:11.427 --> 00:25:16.322
by a process called translation.
Here's another picture of

00:25:16.322 --> 00:25:19.244
it here, showing it in a little
bit more detail,

00:25:19.244 --> 00:25:22.850
that you have lots of DNA in
each of the cells in your body

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:26.269
but you're not using all that
DNA at any one time.

00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:29.840
Every cell in your body is only
using a fraction of the DNA

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.803
that's available to it.
Cells in your pancreas,

00:25:32.803 --> 00:25:35.589
for example,
are making the protein insulin.

00:25:35.589 --> 00:25:38.417
They're making that because you
need this protein insulin,

00:25:38.417 --> 00:25:40.550
it's a hormone,
and it's important for sugar

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:44.337
metabolism in your body.
Those cells in your pancreas

00:25:44.337 --> 00:25:48.023
are making insulin.
That means the gene that

00:25:48.023 --> 00:25:51.889
encodes insulin,
the sequence of base pairs that

00:25:51.889 --> 00:25:55.195
encode insulin.
I'll talk about what that

00:25:55.195 --> 00:25:59.577
means, encoding insulin means in
a minute, but there's a gene

00:25:59.577 --> 00:26:03.740
that tells your body what
insulin looks like and that gets

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.049
transcribed but only in those
cells that make insulin.

00:26:08.049 --> 00:26:10.431
It gets converted into a
protein, insulin,

00:26:10.431 --> 00:26:13.741
only in those cells that are
able to make the RNA that are

00:26:13.741 --> 00:26:15.600
able to express the protein.

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:21.848
Well, it turns out that
proteins are essential in

00:26:21.848 --> 00:26:25.819
driving this process too.
In order to have DNA you have

00:26:25.819 --> 00:26:31.048
to make DNA and your cells are
continually making DNA inside

00:26:31.048 --> 00:26:33.658
your body,
through a process of DNA

00:26:33.658 --> 00:26:37.000
synthesis and that synthesis is
occurring because of the

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.809
presence of an enzyme,
a protein called DNA polymerase.

00:26:40.809 --> 00:26:43.514
In this same way,
this process of transcription

00:26:43.514 --> 00:26:46.924
which is occurring in cells
throughout body all the time is

00:26:46.924 --> 00:26:50.039
made possible by a protein
called RNA polymerase.

00:26:50.039 --> 00:26:55.910
It allows RNA to be made from a
DNA template.

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:59.959
It's not as simple as DNA going
to RNA going to protein,

00:26:59.959 --> 00:27:04.155
because proteins need to be
present in order to make these

00:27:04.155 --> 00:27:07.190
things happen as well.
Let's talk about DNA

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:09.585
synthesis for a minute.
When a cell divides in your

00:27:09.585 --> 00:27:11.523
body, when cells of your
intestine divide,

00:27:11.523 --> 00:27:15.035
when cells of your skin divide,
and they're doing this all the

00:27:15.035 --> 00:27:18.592
time, in order for a cell to
divide and form two daughter

00:27:18.592 --> 00:27:22.339
cells--we'll talk about that
process next week--but in order

00:27:22.339 --> 00:27:26.150
for that to happen the parent
cell has to copy all of its DNA

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:30.470
in order to have enough DNA to
pass on to two daughter cells.

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:33.650
It does that through a process
of DNA synthesis.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:38.551
What happens is the machinery
of the cell, largely this

00:27:38.551 --> 00:27:43.692
protein DNA polymerase,
is able to open up the double

00:27:43.692 --> 00:27:47.259
stranded DNA,
to denature it locally,

00:27:47.259 --> 00:27:53.104
exposing two strands which it
then makes - allows it to make

00:27:53.104 --> 00:27:56.789
copies of.
What's shown here is what's

00:27:56.789 --> 00:28:01.190
called a replication fork in DNA
that's undergoing synthesis.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:04.533
The DNA molecule here has been
spread apart,

00:28:04.533 --> 00:28:09.198
opening up two single stranded
DNA's which have complementary

00:28:09.198 --> 00:28:13.630
base sequences because they were
double stranded DNA.

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:18.874
A new single stranded DNA is
formed on each one of these open

00:28:18.874 --> 00:28:24.460
single strands.
So DNA is replicated using one

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:31.248
strand of the DNA as a template.
The result of this process if

00:28:31.248 --> 00:28:36.119
this replication went down the
whole length of the DNA would be

00:28:36.119 --> 00:28:40.519
to form two identical,
double stranded DNA molecules.

00:28:40.519 --> 00:28:43.564
Now the book talks in more
detail about this and you can

00:28:43.564 --> 00:28:46.075
read about it.
Polymerase needs a primer and

00:28:46.075 --> 00:28:50.107
that turns out to be important.
A primer is a short RNA

00:28:50.107 --> 00:28:55.555
sequence or DNA sequence that
gets sort of the process of

00:28:55.555 --> 00:28:59.696
replication jump started,
and that's just because of the

00:28:59.696 --> 00:29:02.387
biological properties of DNA
polymerase that that primer's

00:29:02.387 --> 00:29:04.378
needed.
Synthesis always occurs in

00:29:04.378 --> 00:29:07.214
one direction and that makes
sense to you now because you

00:29:07.214 --> 00:29:10.201
know there's a directionality
and the chemistry is different

00:29:10.201 --> 00:29:13.340
going one way than the other and
this DNA polymerase only works

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.720
on the chemistry going in one
direction.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.530
The correct complement is made
because of these principles of

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:25.019
Watson-Crick base pairing that
we talked about before.

00:29:25.019 --> 00:29:28.309
It's easy to know what
nucleotide to put in each

00:29:28.309 --> 00:29:32.859
position as you're going along
and polymerizing a new molecule.

00:29:32.859 --> 00:29:35.854
Because this process occurs
this way, if a parent cell

00:29:35.854 --> 00:29:38.736
replicates its DNA and then
passes them along to two

00:29:38.736 --> 00:29:41.933
daughter cells,
one of the daughter cells has

00:29:41.933 --> 00:29:46.034
one strand from the parent,
the dark blue strand here for

00:29:46.034 --> 00:29:48.422
example,
the other daughter cell has the

00:29:48.422 --> 00:29:50.720
light blue strand,
the complementary strand,

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:55.196
and each of the daughter cells
has a newly synthesized piece of

00:29:55.196 --> 00:29:55.630
DNA.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.520
That's synthesis and that has
to happen in order for cells to

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.511
replicate and cell replication
is happening in your body all

00:30:06.511 --> 00:30:08.413
the time.
Transcription is also

00:30:08.413 --> 00:30:10.730
happening.
Certain segments of DNA are

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:14.269
being converted into RNA,
and whereas in replication,

00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:17.650
you have to copy the whole
genome, the whole - all of the

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:21.151
chromosomes, all of the DNA
contained in the chromosomes of

00:30:21.151 --> 00:30:24.109
the cell in order to completely
replicate it;

00:30:24.109 --> 00:30:28.640
transcription only works on
particular sequences of DNA.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.800
The DNA that encodes the
proteins that are important to

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.853
the life of that cell.
A pancreas--cell in the

00:30:35.853 --> 00:30:38.469
pancreas, for example,
needs to make insulin and so

00:30:38.469 --> 00:30:40.509
the gene for insulin is
transcribed.

00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:47.403
Transcription just means
making a single stranded RNA

00:30:47.403 --> 00:30:52.819
copy of a sequence of base pairs
in a DNA.

00:30:52.819 --> 00:30:55.291
I told you that that's driven
by a protein called RNA

00:30:55.291 --> 00:30:57.876
polymerase.
RNA polymerase is smart,

00:30:57.876 --> 00:31:02.873
it knows where it needs to go
in order to make the copy of RNA

00:31:02.873 --> 00:31:06.174
that's required.
It operates in a similar

00:31:06.174 --> 00:31:10.243
fashion to DNA polymerase in
that it denatures locally or

00:31:10.243 --> 00:31:12.859
opens up the double stranded
DNA,

00:31:12.859 --> 00:31:18.011
but it's different in that it
creates a new polymer from the

00:31:18.011 --> 00:31:21.329
DNA template in the language of
RNA,

00:31:21.329 --> 00:31:25.160
using RNA nucleotides and not
DNA nucleotides.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.795
The end result of transcription
is not double stranded DNA,

00:31:29.795 --> 00:31:34.271
it's single stranded RNA where
the RNA that's produced is

00:31:34.271 --> 00:31:41.245
called messenger RNA.
It's the transcribed version of

00:31:41.245 --> 00:31:49.111
DNA, and it's the exact
complement of a particular

00:31:49.111 --> 00:31:53.338
region of DNA.
Again, more details in your

00:31:53.338 --> 00:31:56.596
book if you want to read that.
Well, what I said is not

00:31:56.596 --> 00:31:59.779
entirely true.
That used to be the way that we

00:31:59.779 --> 00:32:02.076
thought about it.
DNA goes to RNA,

00:32:02.076 --> 00:32:04.740
goes to protein,
that's it, and that is the way

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.519
it happens in simple organisms
like bacteria.

00:32:07.519 --> 00:32:10.483
In complex organisms like
humans there's another step that

00:32:10.483 --> 00:32:12.460
we're still only learning about
now.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.430
We know some parts of it,
we don't know all of it.

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:19.184
It's very important in the
biological operation of human

00:32:19.184 --> 00:32:22.470
cells and that step is RNA
splicing,

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:27.221
or processing of this RNA,
single stranded RNA that's

00:32:27.221 --> 00:32:31.983
produced by transcription.
We're going to talk more about

00:32:31.983 --> 00:32:36.096
this as we go through some
specific examples of where RNA

00:32:36.096 --> 00:32:39.502
processing is important.
For now, just think about

00:32:39.502 --> 00:32:43.030
modifying your picture of this
sort of information flow through

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:46.046
a cell to include another step
that RNA is produced by

00:32:46.046 --> 00:32:49.900
transcription from DNA,
double stranded DNA goes to a

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:54.343
single stranded RNA molecule,
and that RNA is processed in

00:32:54.343 --> 00:32:58.630
the cell in some way in order to
form messenger RNA.

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:02.900
One of the forms of
processing that happens,

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:08.443
that's very important in human
gene expression is that some of

00:33:08.443 --> 00:33:13.894
the sections of the DNA molecule
are not really necessary for

00:33:13.894 --> 00:33:18.264
describing the protein.
The regions that are necessary

00:33:18.264 --> 00:33:21.502
for describing what the protein
is like are called exons,

00:33:21.502 --> 00:33:24.220
the regions that are not are
called introns.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.958
A section of DNA that is
responsible for encoding a gene,

00:33:27.958 --> 00:33:31.029
let's say it's the insulin gene
for example,

00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:34.779
might be some stretch of DNA on
a certain chromosome inside your

00:33:34.779 --> 00:33:37.279
cells, inside the cells of the
pancreas.

00:33:37.279 --> 00:33:40.109
If it was directly transcribed
there'd be regions that are

00:33:40.109 --> 00:33:42.890
important for making insulin and
regions that are not.

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:47.366
Those regions that are not are
spliced out during RNA

00:33:47.366 --> 00:33:52.272
processing to form the mRNA
transcript that's used to make

00:33:52.272 --> 00:33:55.450
the protein.
Now there are other kinds

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:58.990
of processing that can happen to
RNA as well, and again,

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:02.229
I said this is really still an
emerging science,

00:34:02.229 --> 00:34:04.710
but this is one that's well
known,

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:07.069
and you could imagine that it's
important.

00:34:07.069 --> 00:34:10.964
If I want to clone a gene from
a human, if I want to clone the

00:34:10.964 --> 00:34:14.533
gene for human insulin,
mean make many copies of the

00:34:14.533 --> 00:34:17.493
gene that's responsible for
making insulin,

00:34:17.493 --> 00:34:21.510
I need to know whether there
are introns there or not.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:25.935
If I'm going to make insulin
from this I have to know that

00:34:25.935 --> 00:34:29.429
I've got the introns spliced out
correctly.

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:32.956
That's something that will come
up in the lecture tomorrow,

00:34:32.956 --> 00:34:36.422
so remember that concept and
that revision of this sort of

00:34:36.422 --> 00:34:39.230
classical picture.
I don't want to go through

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.679
this in detail because I assume
that you know it,

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:44.247
plus I think it's a little bit
easier to read and have some

00:34:44.247 --> 00:34:47.090
time to digest,
but this process of translation

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:51.203
or conversion of messenger RNA
into a protein is a complicated

00:34:51.203 --> 00:34:54.710
biological process that's
occurring all the time.

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:58.860
Before, we talked about how do
you know what messenger RNA to

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:03.079
make, how do you know what RNA
to copy from a DNA template?

00:35:03.079 --> 00:35:06.394
Well you do that by this
Watson-Crick base pairing,

00:35:06.394 --> 00:35:09.642
so I know if I have
(A)(C)(G)(C)(G)(A) I know what

00:35:09.642 --> 00:35:13.752
messenger RNA to make from that
because I have to satisfy these

00:35:13.752 --> 00:35:17.662
base pairing rules.
It's more complicated in

00:35:17.662 --> 00:35:22.247
making protein from an RNA
strand and that complication is

00:35:22.247 --> 00:35:27.389
called the genetic code.
You know that messenger RNA is

00:35:27.389 --> 00:35:33.427
read in three base units called
codons, and so this particular

00:35:33.427 --> 00:35:39.366
piece of messenger RNA is drawn
in this cartoon in three base

00:35:39.366 --> 00:35:44.107
pair units.
That's because every three base

00:35:44.107 --> 00:35:48.590
pairs describes an amino acid in
a protein.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:52.516
While there are only four
different bases that make up

00:35:52.516 --> 00:35:56.146
either RNA or DNA,
and so the complexity of an RNA

00:35:56.146 --> 00:36:00.162
polymer is limited.
It's only got one of four

00:36:00.162 --> 00:36:03.400
possible choices at each
position.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:07.053
There are more than 20 amino
acids that make up the

00:36:07.053 --> 00:36:09.829
biological polymers called
proteins,

00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:17.124
so there are 20 choices of each
amino acid at a position on a

00:36:17.124 --> 00:36:21.324
protein.
Why are there three bases

00:36:21.324 --> 00:36:25.561
in a codon?
Because it takes three units

00:36:25.561 --> 00:36:31.779
where there's only four choices
at each position to have at

00:36:31.779 --> 00:36:37.290
least 20 unique combinations.
How many combinations of codons

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:41.452
are there if there's three bases
and four possibilities at each

00:36:41.452 --> 00:36:45.808
base?
4 x 4 x 4--possibilities,

00:36:45.808 --> 00:36:51.612
because I could have
(A)(G)(C)(U) here,

00:36:51.612 --> 00:36:58.179
(A)(G)(C)(U),
(A)(G)(C)(U) - 4 x 4 = 16.

00:36:58.179 --> 00:37:01.659
If I only had two per codon I
wouldn't have enough.

00:37:01.659 --> 00:37:04.837
I'd only have 16 possible two
base sequences,

00:37:04.837 --> 00:37:08.519
that's not enough to specify
over 20 amino acids.

00:37:08.519 --> 00:37:13.736
If I have three,
I have 16 x 4 or 64 possible

00:37:13.736 --> 00:37:19.451
choices, way more than enough.
That creates a problem in the

00:37:19.451 --> 00:37:23.494
genetic code in that there's 64
possible sequences but there's

00:37:23.494 --> 00:37:28.451
only 20 some amino acids,
so each amino acid can be

00:37:28.451 --> 00:37:32.670
specified by more than one
codon.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:38.373
There are combinations to spare.
There are 64 combinations of

00:37:38.373 --> 00:37:42.903
three bases and I only need to
describe 20, so there's

00:37:42.903 --> 00:37:47.834
combinations to spare.
If I look this table here

00:37:47.834 --> 00:37:53.231
shows you how biological
translation takes place whenever

00:37:53.231 --> 00:37:56.989
a three base sequence is
identified.

00:37:56.989 --> 00:38:01.300
Say it's (G)(C)(U),
that specify an amino acid.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.010
How would I know what amino
acid that is?

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:06.902
Well, I could look up this
table because somebody's figured

00:38:06.902 --> 00:38:10.924
it out for you.
(G) in the first position,

00:38:10.924 --> 00:38:17.518
(C) in the second position,
(U) in the--(G)(C)(U) right

00:38:17.518 --> 00:38:24.967
here is alanine and that's the
protein - that's the amino acid

00:38:24.967 --> 00:38:30.340
that's in that position in the
protein.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:34.292
You could read through this
sequence and you could figure

00:38:34.292 --> 00:38:37.679
out what the sequence of amino
acids would be.

00:38:37.679 --> 00:38:41.821
The genetic code is said to
be degenerate because I can read

00:38:41.821 --> 00:38:44.471
in one direction.
I can read (G)(C)(U) as

00:38:44.471 --> 00:38:47.580
alanine, for example,
from this table and if I see a

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.139
(G)(C)(U), I know it has to be
alanine.

00:38:50.139 --> 00:38:52.798
If I have the protein and I
want to say what does the

00:38:52.798 --> 00:38:55.610
messenger RNA that produced that
protein looked like,

00:38:55.610 --> 00:39:01.045
I can't go backwards because
there's more than one

00:39:01.045 --> 00:39:04.829
possibility for alanine,
right?

00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:08.765
There's four of them right here
(G)(C)(U), (G)(C)(C),

00:39:08.765 --> 00:39:13.532
(G)(C)(A), (G)(C)(G) so I don't
know exactly what gene that came

00:39:13.532 --> 00:39:17.432
from, I can't read backwards.
That has to do with the

00:39:17.432 --> 00:39:19.079
statistics of this,
right?

00:39:19.079 --> 00:39:23.631
There's just more sequences in
a three unit codon than I need

00:39:23.631 --> 00:39:27.038
for the amino acids.
How does translation occur

00:39:27.038 --> 00:39:29.724
biologically?
As shown in this cartoon here,

00:39:29.724 --> 00:39:32.849
again you don't need to know
the details of this,

00:39:32.849 --> 00:39:35.626
but if you're interested in
knowing what's the biological

00:39:35.626 --> 00:39:37.559
bases of the genetic code this
is it.

00:39:37.559 --> 00:39:43.205
Inside cells in your body there
are special RNA molecules called

00:39:43.205 --> 00:39:46.901
transfer RNA.
They are RNA molecules but they

00:39:46.901 --> 00:39:51.452
have at some points in their
life span, they have amino acids

00:39:51.452 --> 00:39:54.184
attached to them.
For example,

00:39:54.184 --> 00:39:59.954
this transfer RNA has a unit
here, (G)(A)(G) at one end of

00:39:59.954 --> 00:40:04.644
the transfer RNA molecule.
At the other end,

00:40:04.644 --> 00:40:08.360
is attached the amino acid
leucine.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:13.437
And your cells making transfer
RNA, if they make a transfer RNA

00:40:13.437 --> 00:40:18.105
molecule that has (G)(A)(G)
here, they only put leucine at

00:40:18.105 --> 00:40:22.090
the other end.
That's the physical basis of

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:27.648
the genetic code because when a
messenger RNA sequence is being

00:40:27.648 --> 00:40:32.219
transcribed one base pair - one
codon at a time,

00:40:32.219 --> 00:40:37.783
when the sequence (C)(U)(C)
appears in the messenger RNA,

00:40:37.783 --> 00:40:43.346
that sequence (C)(U)(C) can
only bind with one particular

00:40:43.346 --> 00:40:48.793
three base complement,
it has to be the complement

00:40:48.793 --> 00:40:51.409
(G)(A)(G).
This is the codon,

00:40:51.409 --> 00:40:55.435
this is the anti-codon,
there's only one anti-codon

00:40:55.435 --> 00:41:00.428
that matches this one and that
anti-codon is always - occurs in

00:41:00.428 --> 00:41:05.260
a molecule that has leucine
attached to the other side.

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:10.473
Translation occurs by a
special kind of polymerization

00:41:10.473 --> 00:41:15.412
where these transfer RNA's
operate by Watson-Crick base

00:41:15.412 --> 00:41:19.374
pairing.
They bring into proximity an

00:41:19.374 --> 00:41:25.002
amino acid so that instead of
forming a new polymer of a

00:41:25.002 --> 00:41:29.402
nucleic acid,
a polymer of an amino acids is

00:41:29.402 --> 00:41:32.431
formed.
A polymer of amino acids is a

00:41:32.431 --> 00:41:34.471
protein.
Again, I'm just trying to

00:41:34.471 --> 00:41:37.554
highlight things you already
know a little bit about,

00:41:37.554 --> 00:41:41.529
the book describes the details.
This isn't particularly

00:41:41.529 --> 00:41:46.384
important for us to know here,
but that messenger RNA gets

00:41:46.384 --> 00:41:51.409
converted into a protein of a
specific composition through a

00:41:51.409 --> 00:41:56.179
biological process called
translation is important.

00:41:56.179 --> 00:41:59.102
The last thing I want to
talk about today is control of

00:41:59.102 --> 00:42:01.882
gene expression.
Control of gene expression is a

00:42:01.882 --> 00:42:05.626
very big topic and so I'm going
to show you one cartoon to sort

00:42:05.626 --> 00:42:09.369
of tell you that it is a big
topic that's really important.

00:42:09.369 --> 00:42:12.139
Why is control of gene
expression important?

00:42:12.139 --> 00:42:15.833
Well I talked about it -
earlier I've mentioned several

00:42:15.833 --> 00:42:20.612
times all the cells in my body,
all the cells in your body have

00:42:20.612 --> 00:42:24.844
essentially the same genomic
chromosomal DNA in their

00:42:24.844 --> 00:42:27.052
nucleus.
If you looked at cells in my

00:42:27.052 --> 00:42:29.865
pancreas and cells in my brain,
and cells in my skin they all

00:42:29.865 --> 00:42:32.862
have the same DNA.
But skin cells and brain cells

00:42:32.862 --> 00:42:36.150
and pancreas cells aren't doing
the same things.

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:38.426
They don't look the same,
they don't behave the same,

00:42:38.426 --> 00:42:40.660
they don't perform the same
biological functions.

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:44.080
Why?
Because brain cells and

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:47.429
pancreas cells are expressing
different proteins.

00:42:47.429 --> 00:42:51.539
All the cells in your body have
the capability of making all the

00:42:51.539 --> 00:42:54.801
proteins that you make,
but they're not all made in

00:42:54.801 --> 00:42:57.960
every cell.
Only cells of your pancreas

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.139
make insulin,
for example.

00:43:00.139 --> 00:43:03.383
Only cells in your brain make
the enzymes that produce certain

00:43:03.383 --> 00:43:06.679
neuron transmitters that are
responsible for brain function.

00:43:06.679 --> 00:43:09.448
How do cells in your brain
know which proteins they ought

00:43:09.448 --> 00:43:11.109
to be making,
and how do cells in the

00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:13.739
pancreas know which proteins
they ought to be making?

00:43:13.739 --> 00:43:20.119
They do that because they can
control the expression of genes.

00:43:20.119 --> 00:43:23.499
Gene expression,
for us, will mean the same

00:43:23.499 --> 00:43:27.199
thing as production of a
particular protein.

00:43:27.199 --> 00:43:32.515
When a gene gets expressed,
that means its protein is

00:43:32.515 --> 00:43:34.837
produced.
When we talk about gene

00:43:34.837 --> 00:43:37.803
expression than we're talking
about this whole sequence of

00:43:37.803 --> 00:43:39.989
events I just described:
transcription,

00:43:39.989 --> 00:43:44.407
RNA processing,
translation to make the

00:43:44.407 --> 00:43:47.712
protein.
All those things have to happen

00:43:47.712 --> 00:43:51.374
in an orderly fashion,
in enough quantity in order for

00:43:51.374 --> 00:43:54.070
a particular cell to make a
protein.

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:55.836
To make insulin,
for example,

00:43:55.836 --> 00:43:58.873
your cells of your pancreas
have to be transcribing that

00:43:58.873 --> 00:44:01.009
gene,
it has to be processed,

00:44:01.009 --> 00:44:04.360
has to be translated into the
protein insulin.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:08.708
But that's not all,
that protein insulin is made in

00:44:08.708 --> 00:44:14.100
the form of a long polypeptide
that not - that's not always the

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:18.022
final version of the protein.
In fact, for insulin,

00:44:18.022 --> 00:44:20.928
it's not the final version of
the protein that comes out of

00:44:20.928 --> 00:44:23.875
translation.
There are more steps that have

00:44:23.875 --> 00:44:28.559
to happen correctly in order for
that insulin to become active.

00:44:28.559 --> 00:44:31.131
Those steps are called
post-translational

00:44:31.131 --> 00:44:33.920
modifications.
It's a long word that just

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:37.644
means other chemistry that
happens on the molecule after

00:44:37.644 --> 00:44:40.721
translation.
It turns out that the kinds of

00:44:40.721 --> 00:44:45.050
post-translational modifications
that human cells are able to do

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:47.578
are very complicated.
You can do many

00:44:47.578 --> 00:44:49.570
post-translational
modifications;

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:51.938
your cells are capable of doing
many post-translational

00:44:51.938 --> 00:44:54.788
modifications.
Bacteria, or simple organisms,

00:44:54.788 --> 00:44:58.232
are not always capable of that.
Now that's going to be

00:44:58.232 --> 00:45:01.374
important when we talk about
making human gene - making human

00:45:01.374 --> 00:45:03.940
proteins inside alternate hosts
like bacteria,

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:08.789
that they can't do all the
things that your cells can do.

00:45:08.789 --> 00:45:11.159
How is gene expression
controlled?

00:45:11.159 --> 00:45:13.309
It can be controlled in a
variety of ways.

00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:18.026
The most basic control is by
controlling when transcription

00:45:18.026 --> 00:45:20.202
happens.
When transcription happens and

00:45:20.202 --> 00:45:22.746
it turns out that there's a
whole biology associated with

00:45:22.746 --> 00:45:24.643
this,
including molecules that are

00:45:24.643 --> 00:45:27.547
floating around inside your
cells called transcription

00:45:27.547 --> 00:45:29.576
factors,
and their job-- they are

00:45:29.576 --> 00:45:33.201
molecules that are (that know)
about particular genes and what

00:45:33.201 --> 00:45:36.530
some of the sequences and are
able to turn on those genes

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:39.380
inside cells,
to make them transcribe.

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:42.192
It requires RNA processing to
happen smoothly,

00:45:42.192 --> 00:45:45.755
so if you can interfere with
RNA processing you can stop a

00:45:45.755 --> 00:45:49.452
gene from being expressed.
If you can interfere with any

00:45:49.452 --> 00:45:53.412
stage in RNA processing you can
stop a gene from being expressed

00:45:53.412 --> 00:45:57.308
and this is a very hot topic in
molecular biology now and human

00:45:57.308 --> 00:45:59.668
therapeutics.
You've heard about RNA

00:45:59.668 --> 00:46:01.065
interference,
for example,

00:46:01.065 --> 00:46:03.299
and that is the process of
stopping this,

00:46:03.299 --> 00:46:05.590
to stop a gene from being
expressed.

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:07.365
For example,
a gene that makes a cell

00:46:07.365 --> 00:46:10.030
cancerous, I'd like to stop it
from being expressed.

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:13.465
And you could interfere with a
translation by degrading

00:46:13.465 --> 00:46:15.309
messenger RNA,
for example.

00:46:15.309 --> 00:46:17.833
If you had a way to
specifically chew up all the RNA

00:46:17.833 --> 00:46:21.050
molecules that are responsible
for making a particular protein,

00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:26.201
you could stop it from being
expressed even though your cell

00:46:26.201 --> 00:46:29.332
is trying to make it.
I want you to look at this

00:46:29.332 --> 00:46:31.749
picture, read the little bit
about gene - control of gene

00:46:31.749 --> 00:46:34.752
expression - that's in the book,
know that it's a big topic,

00:46:34.752 --> 00:46:37.957
that we're not going to talk
about it except we're going to

00:46:37.957 --> 00:46:41.273
talk about some examples where
control of gene expression can

00:46:41.273 --> 00:46:43.760
be exploited in order to treat
diseases,

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.900
for example.
So I'll see you on

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:46.900
Thursday.

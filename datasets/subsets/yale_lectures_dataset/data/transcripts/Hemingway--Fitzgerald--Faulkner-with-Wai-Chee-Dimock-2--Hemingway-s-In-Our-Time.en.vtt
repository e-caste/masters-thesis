00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:08.733
WAI CHEE DIMOCK: In Our Time, 
as we'll find out,

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.233
many of the titles of the

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:18.600
novels are actually from very
canonical works, or very

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.000
ancient works in the
case of Faulkner.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.100
In the case of Hemingway, the
title is from the Book of

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.500
Common Prayer.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.300
"Give us peace in our time, O
Lord." So it's very much a

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.767
meditation on war and peace
and thinking about what

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:42.367
happens in war and also thinking
about what happens

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:47.900
when we have theoretical peace,
but maybe war is still

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.167
going on in some fashion.

00:00:49.167 --> 00:00:53.733
So it's really praying
for peace.

00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:56.800
I should talk a little bit about
the publication history

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.467
of In Our Time.

00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:02.633
It has a very interesting and

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:05.200
complicated publication history.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.633
Initially, a lot of the
vignettes from In Our Time--

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:14.033
what we would call vignettes,
Hemingway call chapters--

00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:17.967
those were published first. So
they were published in the

00:01:17.967 --> 00:01:19.300
little reviews.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.600
And this one is actually called
The Little Review.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.733
And so there's some
publishing there.

00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:30.900
And some of the stories,
actually, were also published

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.267
in the little reviews.

00:01:32.267 --> 00:01:36.533
And this one is called what we
now call "Indian Camp" that

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.767
we'll be talking about today,
that was published in The

00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:42.933
Transatlantic Review.

00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:48.133
And the first edition of In
Our Time was actually

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.867
published in Paris.

00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:56.433
It was published by the Three
Mountains Press, looking

00:01:56.433 --> 00:01:58.033
handcrafted--

00:01:58.033 --> 00:02:00.067
in fact, it was handcrafted.

00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:03.000
Only 30 pages, so really just
all the vignettes, all the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.033
chapters were in that edition.

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:09.400
And only 170 copies
were printed.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.900
So this is really the
very beginning

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.200
of Hemingway's career.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.633
And it's really interesting to
see that that's how he started

00:02:16.633 --> 00:02:20.700
out, someone who really
was thinking of 170

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.867
people reading his work.

00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:29.567
But even though only 170
copies were printed, it

00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:33.700
actually got very, very warm
responses right away.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.667
And it is actually amazing to
think that it got picked up

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:43.100
right away by Fitzgerald, who
wrote his editor, Maxwell

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.933
Perkins at Scribner's, saying
that the vignettes are really

00:02:48.933 --> 00:02:51.433
remarkable, I'll look
him up right away.

00:02:51.433 --> 00:02:52.633
He's the real thing.

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:58.800
So this is back in 1924 when
Hemingway was a total unknown.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.333
So the first American
edition was

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:06.867
published by Boni &amp; Liveright.

00:03:06.867 --> 00:03:09.100
This is Hemingway's
first publisher.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.233
He would then move on to
Scribner's, and Scribner's is

00:03:13.233 --> 00:03:18.000
the publisher that controls all
the copyright to all the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.900
Hemingway novels.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.867
But he started out with
Boni &amp; Liveright.

00:03:22.867 --> 00:03:25.500
And there were a few more--

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.267
not just the vignettes, now--

00:03:27.267 --> 00:03:33.867
but a few of the stories were
included in this 1925 edition

00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:41.367
of In Our Time, but still
a very handmade look.

00:03:41.367 --> 00:03:47.133
And Hemingway did not have a
very happy relation to Boni &amp;

00:03:47.133 --> 00:03:50.800
Liveright, mostly having
to do with the

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.600
structure of In Our Time.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.400
On April 22, he wrote to his
good friend, author John Dos

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.433
Passos, saying, "A Mrs. George
Kaufman is here and she claims

00:04:08.433 --> 00:04:10.733
they want to cut it all out--

00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:12.300
the Indian Camp story.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.667
Cut the In Our Time chapters.

00:04:14.667 --> 00:04:17.433
Jesus I feel all shot
to Hell about it.

00:04:17.433 --> 00:04:20.767
Of course they can't do it
because the stuff is so tight

00:04:20.767 --> 00:04:25.600
and hard and everything hangs
on everything else." This is

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.700
1925, but already we can see
the Hemingway that we

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:37.767
recognize later, somebody who
loves his material, wants his

00:04:37.767 --> 00:04:42.800
material to be tight and hard
and everything hanging on

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.300
everything else.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.433
But still, it is a very, very
strange claim, given the fact

00:04:48.433 --> 00:04:53.433
that in fact, the publication
history of In Our Time

00:04:53.433 --> 00:04:57.200
suggests that it wasn't
conceived of and it wasn't

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.500
initially published as
all in one piece.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.333
It was actually published
separately.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.800
But meanwhile Hemingway is going
to claim that in fact,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.700
he wants everything
all in one piece.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.933
So I think that this is
something that we should

00:05:15.933 --> 00:05:17.400
really think about.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.800
We should certainly take
Hemingway very seriously that

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.433
he's insisting that everything
is hanging together.

00:05:24.433 --> 00:05:31.000
But also maybe entertaining the
possibility that maybe a

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.200
bit looser than he would like
to think or that he claims.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.467
So let's think about rather
than taking Hemingway

00:05:39.467 --> 00:05:45.867
completely at his word, let's
just say that we'll think of

00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:48.567
the narrative structure
of In Our Time

00:05:48.567 --> 00:05:52.233
as a puzzling structure.

00:05:52.233 --> 00:05:54.167
And this is something
that we can say.

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:56.467
There's not much dispute
about it.

00:05:56.467 --> 00:05:59.833
It doesn't look like a short
story collection.

00:05:59.833 --> 00:06:03.500
It doesn't look like anything
else that we've read.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.433
So this very unusual structure
of the stories being

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:10.833
interspersed with
the chapters.

00:06:10.833 --> 00:06:14.367
And there seems to be an
apparent disjunction

00:06:14.367 --> 00:06:17.133
between these two.

00:06:17.133 --> 00:06:21.700
And there's also a kind of very
rapid shift of location

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:28.100
and perspective between those
pieces that are set in wartime

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.500
Europe and those that are set
in peacetime America in the

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:39.067
Midwest. So it doesn't
work as a linear,

00:06:39.067 --> 00:06:41.033
streamline kind of narrative.

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:43.367
It doesn't look like a
traditional novel.

00:06:43.367 --> 00:06:46.033
It doesn't look like a
collection of short stories.

00:06:46.033 --> 00:06:51.100
So there's something to think
about, to puzzle over.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:59.167
So what I'd like to do today is
actually to give Hemingway

00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:01.733
the benefit of the doubt.

00:07:01.733 --> 00:07:04.967
He's saying that everything
hangs together.

00:07:04.967 --> 00:07:12.733
So let's read three pieces
as if they did

00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:14.600
in fact hang together.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.267
So this is an experiment
in reading.

00:07:19.267 --> 00:07:21.833
We can never prove for
sure that they do

00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:23.167
in fact hang together.

00:07:23.167 --> 00:07:27.967
But because Hemingway is so
emphatic about it, let's just

00:07:27.967 --> 00:07:31.200
do this little experiment
of reading three--

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.900
two stories and then
one inter-chapter--

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.900
as if they all belong
together as a unit.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.567
But to say that is also to say
that you guys can experiment

00:07:42.567 --> 00:07:44.600
with other clusters.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.433
This is a possible cluster.

00:07:46.433 --> 00:07:49.233
You can experiment with other
possible clusters.

00:07:49.233 --> 00:07:52.200
So when it comes to writing
papers, this is a great

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.333
opportunity to try out to see
which goes with what.

00:07:57.333 --> 00:08:00.700
So the three that I'm proposing
to read together is

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.900
first of all "Indian Camp." We
know for a fact that that was

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.000
published separately.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.500
So let's not forget
that for a moment.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.100
But still given that it was
initially published in The

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.967
Transatlantic Review, let's
group it with the other two.

00:08:13.967 --> 00:08:16.800
And then "Chapter II" and then
"The Doctor and the Doctor's

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.000
Wife." The reason that those
three hang together in my mind

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:30.400
is that they work on the
same thematic register.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:37.067
And they also work on the same
macro, micro-registers that we

00:08:37.067 --> 00:08:38.500
were talking about last time.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:44.067
So the macro-register is that
there is the tension between

00:08:44.067 --> 00:08:45.767
the Anglos and the
Native Americans.

00:08:45.767 --> 00:08:47.667
Both these stories--

00:08:47.667 --> 00:08:50.400
let's leave out the chapter
first, because it's obviously

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.967
about something else.

00:08:51.967 --> 00:08:55.333
But "Indian Camp" and "The
Doctor and the Doctor's Wife,"

00:08:55.333 --> 00:08:59.300
they both are about the
relations between the Anglos

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:04.800
and the Native Americans and
about tension and conflict

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.433
between them.

00:09:06.433 --> 00:09:12.300
And both stories also share some
important similarity on

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.567
the micro-register.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.500
"Indian Camp" obviously is about
the phenomenon of pain

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.633
and about violence to oneself,
about injury, about injury to

00:09:24.633 --> 00:09:28.867
others, about violence
to oneself.

00:09:28.867 --> 00:09:31.933
And "The Doctor and the Doctor's
Wife" is about

00:09:31.933 --> 00:09:34.900
potential violence.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.867
A fight could break out in that
story, but it doesn't.

00:09:38.867 --> 00:09:42.967
So in some sense, it's the
opposite of Indian Camp.

00:09:42.967 --> 00:09:45.933
It is about the possibility
of violence

00:09:45.933 --> 00:09:47.600
that is being averted.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.500
So just on that basis, it would
seem that there's some

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.733
kind of relation between them.

00:09:53.733 --> 00:09:58.733
So let's look at the
macro-register first. It's not

00:09:58.733 --> 00:10:03.233
as macro as the history of World
War I, but it's macro in

00:10:03.233 --> 00:10:08.367
the sense that it really is
about important sociological

00:10:08.367 --> 00:10:10.100
facts about the United States.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.667
The stories are set
in Horton Bay.

00:10:13.667 --> 00:10:17.867
Actually, this is where the
Hemingway family would go for

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:19.233
their summer vacations.

00:10:19.233 --> 00:10:21.133
It's in Michigan.

00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:23.967
And the Native Americans
are Ojibway--

00:10:26.467 --> 00:10:32.033
Anishinaabe is actually the
preferred destination by them,

00:10:32.033 --> 00:10:36.067
but mostly Ojibway, I think,
is the more common name--

00:10:36.067 --> 00:10:40.633
a very well known group,
very important

00:10:40.633 --> 00:10:42.333
group of Native Americans.

00:10:42.333 --> 00:10:46.033
So there's a whole book
written about them.

00:10:46.033 --> 00:10:55.400
And so this is the background
to the macro-history of the

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.933
two stories.

00:10:56.933 --> 00:11:03.167
And I'd like to introduce three
additional perspectives

00:11:03.167 --> 00:11:07.200
now, on the micro-level which
is talking about the

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.033
phenomenon of pain and injury
and violence and so on.

00:11:11.033 --> 00:11:15.900
And you might or might not have
read these people, but

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.800
they are very influential
people, including obviously a

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.900
great painter writing about
pain and injury and so on.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.267
Elaine Scarry, Susan Sontag,
and Edvard Munch.

00:11:29.267 --> 00:11:32.900
So let's just begin with
Elaine Scarry.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.667
This is a book that came
out in the 1980s.

00:11:36.667 --> 00:11:39.167
It's called A Body in Pain.

00:11:39.167 --> 00:11:43.433
And a lot of it actually has
to do-- and she's done

00:11:43.433 --> 00:11:48.833
extensive research using
the archives at Amnesty

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:50.033
International--

00:11:50.033 --> 00:11:52.133
with looking at the phenomenon
of pain as a

00:11:52.133 --> 00:11:54.433
consequence of torture.

00:11:54.433 --> 00:12:00.433
And the argument about the book
is that when prisoners

00:12:00.433 --> 00:12:04.500
are tortured, when there's
really nothing in the world

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:10.167
open to them except for the
experience of pain, then they

00:12:10.167 --> 00:12:13.767
lose the ability to express
themselves.

00:12:13.767 --> 00:12:17.300
They lose the ability to have
any kind of linguistic

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.033
relation to the world, including
the linguistic

00:12:21.033 --> 00:12:24.767
relation of being able to
describe your own pain.

00:12:24.767 --> 00:12:29.600
So what she argues is that
there's a breakdown of

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.267
language under extreme
conditions of pain.

00:12:33.267 --> 00:12:36.967
The pain basically breaks
down our world.

00:12:36.967 --> 00:12:39.567
And the first thing, the
most important thing

00:12:39.567 --> 00:12:41.567
to go is our language.

00:12:41.567 --> 00:12:45.200
Because according to Elaine
Scarry, it is language that

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.733
anchors and constitutes
our world.

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:54.833
So it is an argument about the
power of pain and its ability

00:12:54.833 --> 00:13:00.200
to dehumanize us, because it
takes away our ability to do

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.700
the most fundamentally
human thing, namely

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.200
to speak, use language.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.967
So this is one end of
the spectrum in

00:13:09.967 --> 00:13:11.500
thinking about pain.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.733
On the other end of the
spectrum, a very, very

00:13:13.733 --> 00:13:20.100
different kind of philosophy,
is the public intellectual

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.333
Susan Sontag.

00:13:22.333 --> 00:13:25.433
She died a few years ago.

00:13:25.433 --> 00:13:29.600
But her work has been really,
really important

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.133
for decades, really.

00:13:32.133 --> 00:13:36.100
And one of her best-known books
is called Regarding the

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.433
Pain of Others.

00:13:38.433 --> 00:13:42.033
She really has a completely
different take on pain from

00:13:42.033 --> 00:13:42.833
Elaine Scarry.

00:13:42.833 --> 00:13:46.567
She argues that rather than
thinking about the phenomenon

00:13:46.567 --> 00:13:51.433
of pain itself as a kind of
experiential reality for us,

00:13:51.433 --> 00:13:58.833
she's interested in how the
observation of pain in others

00:13:58.833 --> 00:14:04.333
gives us pleasure, that in some
sense we are affirmed, we

00:14:04.333 --> 00:14:05.733
affirm our own being.

00:14:05.733 --> 00:14:07.000
We affirm ourselves.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.867
We affirm the fact that we are
not feeling pain when we see

00:14:10.867 --> 00:14:11.467
pain in others.

00:14:11.467 --> 00:14:15.700
It's a very tough and in many
ways a kind of disturbing

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:22.933
argument, that her basic sense
of the world is that we affirm

00:14:22.933 --> 00:14:26.767
our own being by being
able to tell

00:14:26.767 --> 00:14:28.367
ourselves apart from others.

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:31.733
So when we see someone in acute
pain, we know that we

00:14:31.733 --> 00:14:34.633
are someone else, that we are
what we are, because we're not

00:14:34.633 --> 00:14:35.933
going through that pain.

00:14:35.933 --> 00:14:40.000
So there's a kind of indirect
pleasure from seeing the pain

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.533
in others, and you can see it
in the cover of her book.

00:14:45.533 --> 00:14:47.033
So it's a very disturbing
outlook, but

00:14:47.033 --> 00:14:49.333
something to keep in mind.

00:14:49.333 --> 00:14:56.700
And both of those models
I want to call to your

00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:03.433
attention, because I think that
Hemingway actually has

00:15:03.433 --> 00:15:07.333
something to say to each
of them, actually.

00:15:07.333 --> 00:15:11.033
And I would encourage you in
section to think about what

00:15:11.033 --> 00:15:14.200
Hemingway would say to Elaine
Scarry, what Hemingway would

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.533
say to Susan Sontag.

00:15:15.533 --> 00:15:18.267
He obviously wasn't writing for
them, but given the fact

00:15:18.267 --> 00:15:20.867
that he has written stories that
have to do with pain, how

00:15:20.867 --> 00:15:24.600
he would respond to
those theories.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.900
But I think that Hemingway is
actually closer to the pain of

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:37.233
Munch, and the very celebrated
painting "The Scream." And

00:15:37.233 --> 00:15:42.200
it's really about pain
as a sound, so pain

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.933
coming out as a scream.

00:15:45.933 --> 00:15:51.933
And it is a corrective to Elaine
Scarry in the sense

00:15:51.933 --> 00:15:57.633
that even though we might not be
able to speak when we're in

00:15:57.633 --> 00:16:01.600
acute pain, we still are able to
express ourselves, because

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.900
we can just cry out, even though
it's not a linguistic,

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.600
it's not a word that
we're saying.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.733
The very fact that something is
coming out of us suggests

00:16:08.733 --> 00:16:14.367
that the capacity for expression
hasn't completely

00:16:14.367 --> 00:16:17.133
broken down.

00:16:17.133 --> 00:16:22.933
Munch is not especially
interested in thinking about

00:16:22.933 --> 00:16:26.133
what the scream would
do to others.

00:16:26.133 --> 00:16:29.967
So basically, this is just
somebody who is crying out in

00:16:29.967 --> 00:16:34.033
pain, and probably not bodily
injury either, but just

00:16:34.033 --> 00:16:36.500
psychic pain, just
screaming out.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:41.933
Munch is not putting into the
picture what the scream would

00:16:41.933 --> 00:16:46.700
do to other people listening
to that scream.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:51.100
So I would like to see Hemingway
as collaborating

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.000
with Munch.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.067
Munch is giving us the scream
coming out of the person who

00:16:56.067 --> 00:17:02.733
is suffering, and "Indian Camp"
is Hemingway's extended

00:17:02.733 --> 00:17:07.700
meditation on the phenomenon
of the scream on what the

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:14.067
scream would do to people who
are completely vulnerable to

00:17:14.067 --> 00:17:16.533
that sound of pain.

00:17:16.533 --> 00:17:18.733
Usually we just think of
ourselves as being

00:17:18.733 --> 00:17:20.367
vulnerable to pain.

00:17:20.367 --> 00:17:24.500
But we're also vulnerable
to the sound of pain.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:29.100
So this is a very different
model from the one suggested

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.233
by Susan Sontag.

00:17:30.233 --> 00:17:33.567
I'm already giving you a bit of
an argument about Hemingway

00:17:33.567 --> 00:17:36.733
with saying Sontag is really
thinking about pain as a kind

00:17:36.733 --> 00:17:38.700
of a visual pleasure
to other people.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.533
We see other people
suffering and we

00:17:41.533 --> 00:17:43.567
get some visual pleasure.

00:17:43.567 --> 00:17:50.133
Hemingway is about the auditory
pain that we get as a

00:17:50.133 --> 00:17:54.433
consequence of our ears
being helplessly open

00:17:54.433 --> 00:17:55.600
to the pain of others.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.800
So there's basically a very
important difference between

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.733
the eye and the ear.

00:18:00.733 --> 00:18:02.467
And I think most people
would agree that we

00:18:02.467 --> 00:18:03.667
can shut our eyes.

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:06.667
We don't have to see something
if we don't want to.

00:18:06.667 --> 00:18:09.000
We can't really shut our ears.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.933
We can remove ourselves to a
greater distance and shut our

00:18:11.933 --> 00:18:14.600
ears that way, but if we're in
the neighborhood of someone

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.133
who is screaming, we can't
really shut our ears.

00:18:17.133 --> 00:18:23.233
So "Indian Camp" is really
about what happens when

00:18:23.233 --> 00:18:29.233
someone cannot shut his or
her ears to a scream.

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:34.633
So it's about a woman
giving birth.

00:18:34.633 --> 00:18:39.233
And Nick's father, who is a
doctor, coming to attend to

00:18:39.233 --> 00:18:40.833
that woman.

00:18:40.833 --> 00:18:46.000
It's about an Anglo doctor
coming to a very close-knit

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.967
Native American community to
take care of a Native American

00:18:51.967 --> 00:18:55.967
woman under very primitive
conditions.

00:18:55.967 --> 00:19:01.333
But Hemingway spends a lot of
time actually not just talking

00:19:01.333 --> 00:19:05.700
about Anglo and Indian
relations, but also about the

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.400
relations among Native
Americans.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.967
So this is how the man
reacts to the woman

00:19:11.967 --> 00:19:14.800
giving birth and screaming.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.600
"The men had moved off up the
road to sit in the dark and

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.567
smoke out of range of
the noise she made.

00:19:22.567 --> 00:19:25.767
She screamed just as Nick and
the two Indians follow his

00:19:25.767 --> 00:19:29.000
father into the shanty."

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.967
So this is actually the baseline
for Hemingway, is

00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:42.200
that the scream is unbearable,
even to her own community.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.833
This is someone who is actually
inflicting pain and

00:19:46.833 --> 00:19:53.333
injury on her own Native
American community, not

00:19:53.333 --> 00:19:55.633
because of any conflict
with them.

00:19:55.633 --> 00:19:58.600
So this is a very important
fact to know.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.600
This is not a sociopolitical
conflict,

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.267
socioeconomic conflict.

00:20:04.267 --> 00:20:09.033
It is not the conflict between
two different ethnic groups.

00:20:09.033 --> 00:20:14.367
It is an involuntary
conflict within one

00:20:14.367 --> 00:20:16.000
close-knit ethnic group.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.533
The woman can't help
screaming.

00:20:18.533 --> 00:20:23.800
She can't help causing pain
to her own community.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.600
So the men are trying to do
the best they can to get

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:33.233
themselves out of the way of
the painful screaming that

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:34.900
they're hearing.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.367
And we can think about what
follows from this given, from

00:20:39.367 --> 00:20:40.867
this baseline.

00:20:40.867 --> 00:20:44.300
And actually, there
are two outcomes.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:51.467
And one outcome is actually very
much predicated on the

00:20:51.467 --> 00:20:54.300
importance of ethnic
difference.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:58.633
So here are the Native American
men being completely

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:03.833
overwhelmed and helpless in
the face of the scream.

00:21:03.833 --> 00:21:08.333
But one person, one
person who's not

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:12.033
affected by the scream.

00:21:12.033 --> 00:21:16.167
Why is he not affected? "But her
screams are not important.

00:21:16.167 --> 00:21:20.667
I don't hear them because
they're not important." Who is

00:21:20.667 --> 00:21:24.000
it that says that?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.767
The doctor--

00:21:24.767 --> 00:21:26.700
exactly, thank you--

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.433
is Nick's father.

00:21:28.433 --> 00:21:32.600
So what enables him, what
is it that insulates

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:37.000
him from the scream?

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.133
It seems that if there is
something else they can

00:21:42.133 --> 00:21:46.433
override that sound, there's
something else that is more

00:21:46.433 --> 00:21:51.167
important to you than the
immediacy of that sound, it

00:21:51.167 --> 00:21:54.233
can serve as a protective
shell.

00:21:54.233 --> 00:21:56.867
And as it turns out,
it is the doctor's

00:21:56.867 --> 00:21:59.133
professional identity.

00:21:59.133 --> 00:22:03.100
Because he's able to explain to
Nick what she's just going

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.433
through is something
called labor.

00:22:05.433 --> 00:22:07.533
The baby wants to be born.

00:22:07.533 --> 00:22:10.667
The baby is trying to be born,
she is trying her best so that

00:22:10.667 --> 00:22:12.667
the baby would be born.

00:22:12.667 --> 00:22:17.633
He has a completely coherent
explanation as to why she's

00:22:17.633 --> 00:22:19.100
going through the pain.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.767
And he has a completely coherent
explanation as to why

00:22:22.767 --> 00:22:24.367
she's screaming right now.

00:22:24.367 --> 00:22:29.167
So the coherence of that
explanation, and the fact that

00:22:29.167 --> 00:22:33.267
he is professionally equipped
to put an end to the scream,

00:22:33.267 --> 00:22:36.533
the fact that he as a doctor can
just perform the Caesarian

00:22:36.533 --> 00:22:39.667
operation so that the
scream will stop.

00:22:39.667 --> 00:22:43.433
Both his ability to explain a
phenomenon and his ability to

00:22:43.433 --> 00:22:48.467
put an end to the phenomenon,
those two work together so

00:22:48.467 --> 00:22:53.433
that the scream, while a fact
of life, is not going to be

00:22:53.433 --> 00:22:55.300
devastating to the doctor.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.400
And we all know that.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.000
If doctors were going to be
devastated by screams, they

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.100
wouldn't be doctors, they
wouldn't be able to operate.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:05.900
So a very important feature of
the professional identity of a

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:11.267
doctor is that they should be
able to take a lot of sensory

00:23:11.267 --> 00:23:16.133
input that would be unbearable
to other people and be able to

00:23:16.133 --> 00:23:20.400
put that sensory input
in its place.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.800
Being able to explain it is
being able to put it away and

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.833
being able to cope with it.

00:23:25.833 --> 00:23:28.567
And here's a doctor being
able to cope with that.

00:23:28.567 --> 00:23:31.267
So this is one possible
outcome, is that it's

00:23:31.267 --> 00:23:35.300
basically a kind of
neutralization of the scream.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.967
It is not piercing, it
is not devastating.

00:23:38.967 --> 00:23:42.300
But the process of
neutralization doesn't always

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:42.933
take place.

00:23:42.933 --> 00:23:45.867
So this is outcome two.

00:23:45.867 --> 00:23:49.967
The doctor, Nick's father, is
congratulating himself that

00:23:49.967 --> 00:23:53.267
he's performed an operation,
he's able to do the Caesarian

00:23:53.267 --> 00:23:54.333
with just a jackknife.

00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:56.400
He's going to write it up for
the medical journals.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.367
He's very, very happy
as a doctor.

00:23:58.367 --> 00:24:00.367
He feels very much affirmed.

00:24:00.367 --> 00:24:04.533
And then this one other
development.

00:24:04.533 --> 00:24:08.533
He looks at the proud father,
the person who ought to be the

00:24:08.533 --> 00:24:10.300
proud father.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:14.133
He quickly turns away and
tells Nick not to look.

00:24:14.133 --> 00:24:18.100
So we know what the
outcome two is--

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:22.467
what happens when someone who
is not insulated by his

00:24:22.467 --> 00:24:26.100
professional identity
is helplessly

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.300
subject to the scream.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:32.000
"His throat had been cut
from ear to ear.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.167
The blood had flowed down into
a pool where his body sagged

00:24:36.167 --> 00:24:37.900
the bunk."

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:41.333
So this is a very extreme
reaction.

00:24:41.333 --> 00:24:46.133
I honestly don't know how common
this is, that a father

00:24:46.133 --> 00:24:51.633
would just go to the extreme of
taking his own life because

00:24:51.633 --> 00:24:55.233
he can't really take the
pain of his wife.

00:24:55.233 --> 00:25:00.567
But it's the opposite model from
the Susan Sontag model.

00:25:00.567 --> 00:25:04.600
It's not taking pleasure from
the pain of others but being

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:10.233
completely devastated, being
completely destroyed by the

00:25:10.233 --> 00:25:14.200
pain of others to such an extent
that you want to take

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.433
your biological life because
your inner psychic life has

00:25:17.433 --> 00:25:21.133
been so devastated by
what you cannot bear

00:25:21.133 --> 00:25:23.500
to go through anymore.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:31.200
So this is an extreme case of
empathy, a husband empathizing

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.833
with the wife, feeling the pain
of his wife to such an

00:25:35.833 --> 00:25:39.233
extent, it's almost as if the
pain is doing more to him than

00:25:39.233 --> 00:25:42.767
it is actually doing
to his wife.

00:25:42.767 --> 00:25:50.900
So this is one way to think
about pain, how natural it is.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:56.333
It's naturalized because
it has no socioeconomic

00:25:56.333 --> 00:25:57.400
explanation to it.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.600
It's just a fact of life that
women will give birth.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.033
And it is a fact of life that
they suffer tremendously when

00:26:05.033 --> 00:26:05.800
they give birth.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:10.933
And it's also a fact of life
that when they suffer, other

00:26:10.933 --> 00:26:14.533
people are likely to
suffer as well.

00:26:14.533 --> 00:26:18.100
There is kind of a transitive
relation of pain, spreading

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:24.167
out and becoming more and more
common, becoming more and more

00:26:24.167 --> 00:26:28.733
a universal condition of life,
because there basically is no

00:26:28.733 --> 00:26:33.667
boundary between the pain of
one person and what someone

00:26:33.667 --> 00:26:35.900
else is likely to go through.

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:42.300
So we can say that what we see
in "Indian Camp" is to some

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:46.467
extent a story that gestures
in two directions.

00:26:46.467 --> 00:26:50.433
On the one hand, there's a lot
of interest in the tension

00:26:50.433 --> 00:26:54.900
between Native Americans
and Anglo-Americans.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.233
That's not unimportant.

00:26:57.233 --> 00:26:59.533
It pulls in one direction.

00:26:59.533 --> 00:27:02.900
It also pulls in another
direction, and it pulls in the

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.200
other direction of the
micro-register in terms of

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:11.967
pain, that really the most
fundamental drama is almost

00:27:11.967 --> 00:27:15.100
regardless of the
relation between

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.500
Anglos and Native Americans.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:21.233
You do it to everyone, and you
do it every time you go

00:27:21.233 --> 00:27:22.133
through pain.

00:27:22.133 --> 00:27:27.267
Every time you go into labor,
this is going to happen.

00:27:27.267 --> 00:27:29.933
So it's kind of a naturalization
of pain as a

00:27:29.933 --> 00:27:33.300
kind of universal condition.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.900
Let's look at the inter-chapter
and test this

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:42.800
possibility whether or not
Hemingway is really wanting to

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:48.567
explore the phenomenon that
there's nothing to be done

00:27:48.567 --> 00:27:53.433
about pain, that it is the most
fundamental fact of life,

00:27:53.433 --> 00:27:59.100
that it is as natural as
the sense of hearing.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:03.167
I think that in "Indian Camp"
there's a sense that just as

00:28:03.167 --> 00:28:06.067
we can't help the fact that we
have a pair of ears, we can

00:28:06.067 --> 00:28:09.967
help the fact that we're going
to be vulnerable to the sounds

00:28:09.967 --> 00:28:11.900
of pain made by others.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:17.667
In "Chapter II," Hemingway is
testing this possibility by

00:28:17.667 --> 00:28:22.767
this same kind of play between
the macro and the

00:28:22.767 --> 00:28:25.067
micro-register.

00:28:25.067 --> 00:28:30.800
So the macro-register is the
Greco-Turkish war which we

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.233
already looked at last time.

00:28:33.233 --> 00:28:37.200
And this is about the evacuation
of the Greek

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.900
civilians when the Turkish
army was just

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.767
advancing on them.

00:28:42.767 --> 00:28:49.500
So it's the largest possible
context, large-scale

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.000
geopolitical warfare.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.833
That's the macro context.

00:28:53.833 --> 00:28:57.533
But it's interesting that in
this one very short paragraph,

00:28:57.533 --> 00:29:00.833
Hemingway has transitioned
to something else.

00:29:00.833 --> 00:29:03.233
So let's just read
this paragraph.

00:29:03.233 --> 00:29:07.167
"Greek cavalry herded along
the procession.

00:29:07.167 --> 00:29:10.467
The women and kids were in
the carts, crouched with

00:29:10.467 --> 00:29:16.033
mattresses, mirrors, sewing
machines, bundles.

00:29:16.033 --> 00:29:21.233
There was a woman having a kid
with a young girl holding a

00:29:21.233 --> 00:29:24.700
blanket over her and crying.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.133
Scared sick looking at it.

00:29:27.133 --> 00:29:30.533
It rained all through
the evacuation."

00:29:30.533 --> 00:29:35.400
So obviously this is
classic Hemingway.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.600
About as much is packed into
this one short paragraph as

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.500
could be packed into any
short paragraph.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:49.333
Beginning with the macro context
of the evacuation of

00:29:49.333 --> 00:29:53.967
Greek civilians, we move on to
something that clearly is

00:29:53.967 --> 00:29:58.533
picking up on the thematic
residue from the first story,

00:29:58.533 --> 00:30:02.900
from "Indian Camp," a
woman having a baby.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:06.467
And it follows the same
structure as well.

00:30:06.467 --> 00:30:10.000
Not just a woman having a baby,
but someone watching

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.833
that, observing that, and
being terrified of

00:30:15.833 --> 00:30:18.167
that fact of life.

00:30:18.167 --> 00:30:26.667
So even though we do know that
"Indian Camp" was published

00:30:26.667 --> 00:30:32.000
separately, I think that we have
to grant Hemingway the

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.167
truth of his statement that
the stories and the

00:30:36.167 --> 00:30:39.033
inter-chapters are
really connected.

00:30:39.033 --> 00:30:40.667
They're connected
after the fact.

00:30:40.667 --> 00:30:43.967
The inter-chapters, at least
this particular one, is

00:30:43.967 --> 00:30:50.500
obviously written as a
continuation of a meditation

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.967
on the pain of childbirth.

00:30:52.967 --> 00:30:56.533
And not just the pain of
childbirth as experienced by

00:30:56.533 --> 00:30:59.300
the person who's going through
that phenomenon, going through

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:09.333
the experience, but also as an
observational pain in someone

00:31:09.333 --> 00:31:13.300
who is just an onlooker, what
it does to the onlooker.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.767
It's the same kind of dynamics
of being terrified, being

00:31:16.767 --> 00:31:19.367
scared sick looking at it.

00:31:19.367 --> 00:31:23.733
So it's not quite as extreme
as the husband

00:31:23.733 --> 00:31:25.333
cutting his own throat.

00:31:25.333 --> 00:31:29.100
But being scared sick looking
at it, I would say that is a

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:34.067
fairly extreme response as
well to the phenomenon of

00:31:34.067 --> 00:31:34.567
childbirth.

00:31:34.567 --> 00:31:38.100
So Hemingway is obviously
interested in people being

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:43.067
helpless, being unable to
protect themselves when

00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:47.067
they're faced with the
injury of others.

00:31:47.067 --> 00:31:51.033
It's the lack of protective
insulation.

00:31:51.033 --> 00:31:54.600
That is a phenomenon that
Hemingway is interested in.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:59.400
It's why is it that only a few
people, only people with

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:04.967
professional credentials, like
doctors, are well protected,

00:32:04.967 --> 00:32:10.067
and that most of us actually
tend to be open to injury,

00:32:10.067 --> 00:32:15.467
open to violence from others
in a very helpless way.

00:32:15.467 --> 00:32:18.933
And it's because of that
basic configuration--

00:32:18.933 --> 00:32:21.300
openness to the injury,
openness

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.200
to the pain of others--

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:27.500
that Hemingway moves
on to the last line

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.300
of this little vignette.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:34.467
"It rained all through the
evacuation." On the face of

00:32:34.467 --> 00:32:39.933
it, no connection whatsoever
with the preceding passage.

00:32:39.933 --> 00:32:42.300
It was just about evacuation.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.433
All of a sudden this detail
about it raining--

00:32:48.033 --> 00:32:51.733
the only connection that I
can think of, and it's a

00:32:51.733 --> 00:32:56.667
conjecture on my part, is that
Hemingway has so far been

00:32:56.667 --> 00:33:01.033
talking about human phenomena.

00:33:01.033 --> 00:33:05.067
War is very much a
man-made event.

00:33:05.067 --> 00:33:09.533
Childbirth is a human,
man-made as well.

00:33:09.533 --> 00:33:12.233
I mean, it's natural,
but human beings

00:33:12.233 --> 00:33:14.733
need to bring it about.

00:33:14.733 --> 00:33:20.300
Rain is truly a natural
phenomenon that is without

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:23.633
human input, without
human agency.

00:33:23.633 --> 00:33:29.867
So what we see in this little
vignette is a movement in the

00:33:29.867 --> 00:33:33.100
direction of naturalization.

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:37.133
By the time we get to the end
of the vignette, we get a

00:33:37.133 --> 00:33:42.933
completely natural process
without human input, about

00:33:42.933 --> 00:33:45.933
which human beings
can do nothing.

00:33:45.933 --> 00:33:47.900
And this is the resting point.

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:52.567
This is the place that Hemingway
wants us to get to,

00:33:52.567 --> 00:33:57.300
a place where we are just
passive recipients of

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.333
something that is
coming to us.

00:33:59.333 --> 00:34:01.567
Rain is something that
just happens to us.

00:34:01.567 --> 00:34:04.233
We know this, we've just
been through this.

00:34:04.233 --> 00:34:05.900
Rain is something that
happens to us.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:11.133
We are passive recipients,
something that happens to us.

00:34:11.133 --> 00:34:16.567
The pain of others is natural
in exactly the same way.

00:34:16.567 --> 00:34:20.667
And we're also passive
recipients of the pain of

00:34:20.667 --> 00:34:23.900
others in the same way
that we are passive

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:26.933
recipients of rain.

00:34:26.933 --> 00:34:32.200
There is one experiential
register that is very, very

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:39.133
human that is almost independent
of human agency.

00:34:39.133 --> 00:34:45.833
It is an experience simply
defined by us as recipients,

00:34:45.833 --> 00:34:49.467
as people who just stand
there and things being

00:34:49.467 --> 00:34:51.567
visited upon us.

00:34:51.567 --> 00:34:57.867
So this is, I think, very much
an affirmation of the line of

00:34:57.867 --> 00:35:02.133
thinking already started in
"Indian Camp." It's that no

00:35:02.133 --> 00:35:07.100
matter how well protected we
think we are, and no matter

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:11.867
how good we are, actually, at
what we set out to do-- and

00:35:11.867 --> 00:35:15.200
the doctor, obviously, is a
very, very good doctor-- no

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:21.433
matter how good we are at what
we set out to do, there is a

00:35:21.433 --> 00:35:25.333
limit to what that can
accomplish in the world.

00:35:25.333 --> 00:35:27.967
And the expertise, the
professional expertise of a

00:35:27.967 --> 00:35:32.600
doctor is always going to run
up against a natural limit.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:36.200
And the pain of childbirth is,
in fact, that natural limit.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:41.467
So it's very much a concession
in the direction of the

00:35:41.467 --> 00:35:47.533
naturalness of pain and the
unavoidable intensity, and the

00:35:47.533 --> 00:35:50.433
unavoidable violence that they
can do to other people.

00:35:50.433 --> 00:35:56.800
So this is basically just
repeating summary

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.033
of what I just said.

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.433
Actually, I want to go
over it so that you

00:36:05.433 --> 00:36:06.367
can think about this.

00:36:06.367 --> 00:36:11.100
Let's move on to "The Doctor
and the Doctor's Wife." And

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:16.100
this one, on the face of it, it
really isn't so much about

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:21.200
pain, unless we think
about guilt or shame

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.100
as a kind of pain.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:28.433
But it's nothing like the
extreme kind of mind-numbing,

00:36:28.433 --> 00:36:35.300
mind-destroying pain that we see
in "Indian Camp." So it is

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:39.967
about the tensions between
Anglos and Native Americans.

00:36:39.967 --> 00:36:45.467
So we're back to the macro
level about the kind of

00:36:45.467 --> 00:36:50.533
socioeconomic tension between
two ethnic groups.

00:36:50.533 --> 00:36:56.033
And the tension has to do with
the logs that wash ashore that

00:36:56.033 --> 00:36:58.367
really belong to the logging
company that

00:36:58.367 --> 00:37:00.867
Nick's father claims--

00:37:00.867 --> 00:37:05.567
and because as far as he can
see, it's actually true-- that

00:37:05.567 --> 00:37:07.367
they belong to nobody.

00:37:07.367 --> 00:37:13.700
So he's trying to hire the
Native American workers, just

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:17.200
day laborers, to cut
up the wood.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:24.233
And he gets into a row with the
Native American workers.

00:37:24.233 --> 00:37:28.500
Dick Boulton is basically
taunting him, rubbing it in

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:32.767
that those logs are stolen, that
they don't belong to him,

00:37:32.767 --> 00:37:34.667
and he's doing something
illegal.

00:37:34.667 --> 00:37:38.233
So the professional doctor
is getting more and more

00:37:38.233 --> 00:37:42.400
flustered as this conversation
goes on.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:47.667
And it looks like something's
going to happen.

00:37:47.667 --> 00:37:50.200
And we know that Dick
is a very big man.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.433
He's proud of the fact that
he's such a big man.

00:37:52.433 --> 00:37:54.133
He's not afraid of getting
into a fight.

00:37:54.133 --> 00:37:59.200
So the stage is set,
really, for a real

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.967
inter-ethnic conflict.

00:38:01.967 --> 00:38:09.800
And this is actually what I like
to say as the first step

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:14.000
towards the end of the story
which we know is actually a

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.800
happy ending.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:19.133
The stage is set for the fight
to take place, the fight

00:38:19.133 --> 00:38:20.667
doesn't take place.

00:38:20.667 --> 00:38:25.133
What is it that stops the
fight from taking place?

00:38:25.133 --> 00:38:28.867
What is it that makes what might
have seemed a natural

00:38:28.867 --> 00:38:31.867
scene of violence from actually
being less than

00:38:31.867 --> 00:38:34.767
natural, that is to
say preventable?

00:38:34.767 --> 00:38:38.567
So preventable violence,
preventable injury, this is

00:38:38.567 --> 00:38:40.000
what the story's about.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.600
So this is my candidate for
the first step in that

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:48.267
direction towards the resolution
of violence in the

00:38:48.267 --> 00:38:53.233
direction of peace, which is
what Hemingway is praying for

00:38:53.233 --> 00:38:56.300
in all of these stories.

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.133
"Dick said something
in Ojibway.

00:38:59.133 --> 00:39:04.200
Eddy laughed but Billy Tabeshaw
looked very serious.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:08.000
He did not understand English
but he had sweat all the time

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.900
the row was going on.

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.833
He was fat with only
a few hairs of

00:39:12.833 --> 00:39:15.567
mustache like a Chinaman.

00:39:15.567 --> 00:39:17.867
He picked up the
two cant-hooks.

00:39:17.867 --> 00:39:20.967
Dick picked up the axes
and Eddy took the saw

00:39:20.967 --> 00:39:23.100
down from the tree.

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:27.267
They started off and walked up
past the cottage and out the

00:39:27.267 --> 00:39:29.800
back gate into the woods.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.400
Dick left the gate open.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:38.500
Billy Tabeshaw went back
and fastened it."

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:42.700
So I think it's a really
fascinating portrait, and for

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:46.900
a writer who prides himself on
being completely economical,

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:48.533
actually it's some interesting
details.

00:39:48.533 --> 00:39:52.900
I can't for the life of me
figure out what the point is

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:56.600
for comparing Billy Tabeshaw
to a Chinaman.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.100
It's just an interesting
detail.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.533
So it's something
to think about.

00:39:59.533 --> 00:40:02.233
I can't offer you an explanation
why that

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:05.467
particular detail is in there.

00:40:05.467 --> 00:40:11.400
The only possible reason is that
Hemingway really wants to

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.200
highlight the fact
that because he's

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.933
not an English speaker.

00:40:15.933 --> 00:40:19.933
Therefore, all of this is
really Greek to him.

00:40:19.933 --> 00:40:22.533
And I wouldn't put it past
Hemingway that he's

00:40:22.533 --> 00:40:24.700
resurrecting the Greeks
in this way.

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.533
English is Greek to
Bill Tabeshaw.

00:40:27.533 --> 00:40:33.633
So once again it looks squarely
in the direction of

00:40:33.633 --> 00:40:41.100
inter-ethnic conflict, and
granting primacy to that

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:44.767
inter-ethnic conflict.

00:40:44.767 --> 00:40:49.667
And it goes so far as to say
that here is someone who

00:40:49.667 --> 00:40:53.367
really is completely not in the
Anglo camp, not sharing

00:40:53.367 --> 00:40:56.500
the language at all, not even
having that common ground.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:59.800
But what is really odd, and I
think that that really is the

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:03.000
point in emphasizing that Dick
obviously is totally fluent in

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.733
English, Billy is not
fluent at all,

00:41:07.733 --> 00:41:09.267
can't understand anything.

00:41:09.267 --> 00:41:13.833
But even though he doesn't
have language as to share

00:41:13.833 --> 00:41:19.000
common ground with the Anglos,
he nonetheless knows there's

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.333
something about the chemistry
and the atmosphere of an

00:41:24.333 --> 00:41:30.700
incipient fight that people can
pick up on even if they

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.500
don't understand the language.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:37.933
So this is still Hemingway going
some distance in the

00:41:37.933 --> 00:41:40.667
direction of naturalizing
conflict.

00:41:40.667 --> 00:41:45.233
It is such a natural process
that language as an artificial

00:41:45.233 --> 00:41:47.933
human invention is
not necessary.

00:41:47.933 --> 00:41:50.700
It's not necessarily for us to
understand that something is

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:51.733
about to happen.

00:41:51.733 --> 00:41:56.067
So the fact that Billy is
completely, fully in

00:41:56.067 --> 00:41:59.867
comprehension of the situation
suggests that

00:41:59.867 --> 00:42:02.333
conflict is very deep.

00:42:02.333 --> 00:42:06.700
And it is so deep that we
have kind of a primitive

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:10.333
apprehension of its
incipience.

00:42:10.333 --> 00:42:17.100
So what is also interesting is
that as the Native Americans,

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.900
the Indian laborers leave, they
pick up all their tools

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:24.433
that could be used as
potential weapons.

00:42:24.433 --> 00:42:33.167
So they're not using those
things yet as weapons of

00:42:33.167 --> 00:42:35.233
aggression, or self-defense,
or anything like that.

00:42:35.233 --> 00:42:37.733
They're just still using those
as tools, they've done the

00:42:37.733 --> 00:42:40.233
work, they're going to
take those things

00:42:40.233 --> 00:42:42.500
away, still as tools.

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:48.833
But the fact that Dave has
left the gate open for me

00:42:48.833 --> 00:42:53.600
suggests that he's also leaving
open the possibility

00:42:53.600 --> 00:43:00.667
that those cant-hooks, the saw,
that those things that

00:43:00.667 --> 00:43:07.433
right now are serving only as
useful tools could also be

00:43:07.433 --> 00:43:08.900
used as weapons.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:12.867
He's leaving open that
possibility.

00:43:12.867 --> 00:43:17.300
And he would be pleased,
actually, if those tools were

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:22.033
to be put to a secondary
and more deadly use.

00:43:22.033 --> 00:43:25.133
What is interesting is that
Billy-- who doesn't understand

00:43:25.133 --> 00:43:27.533
English, but who completely
understands the situation--

00:43:27.533 --> 00:43:31.967
is the one who goes back
and fastens the gate.

00:43:31.967 --> 00:43:37.533
So this is a very important
detail from Hemingway, that it

00:43:37.533 --> 00:43:44.033
is someone who really has no
personal relation, has no

00:43:44.033 --> 00:43:45.933
ties, really, to the Anglos.

00:43:45.933 --> 00:43:51.167
He's the one who actually
performs the important task of

00:43:51.167 --> 00:43:52.233
closing the gate.

00:43:52.233 --> 00:43:57.000
So he's one peacemaker coming
from a very unexpected place.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.833
But the fact that it is Billy
who is performing that

00:44:00.833 --> 00:44:04.467
function suggests that it's
almost a counterpoint to the

00:44:04.467 --> 00:44:05.567
natural violence.

00:44:05.567 --> 00:44:08.700
Just as there's a kind of a
natural tendency towards

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:12.200
violence, there's also
a natural tendency

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.767
to keeping the peace.

00:44:13.767 --> 00:44:17.267
They both are firmly embedded
in us, both are

00:44:17.267 --> 00:44:18.667
primitive in us.

00:44:18.667 --> 00:44:22.133
And by primitive I mean
very, very powerful.

00:44:22.133 --> 00:44:25.667
The more primitive they are, the
more deep-seeded they are,

00:44:25.667 --> 00:44:28.000
and more likely they are
going to play out.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.100
So being a peacemaker is
actually a very deep-seeded

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:36.633
desire, really, in all of us.

00:44:36.633 --> 00:44:38.967
And it's being played
out in Billy.

00:44:38.967 --> 00:44:45.733
And so I'd like to test another
possibility, who else

00:44:45.733 --> 00:44:48.667
is Billy being aligned with?

00:44:48.667 --> 00:44:54.133
If Billy is taking the first
step to stop the conflict, is

00:44:54.133 --> 00:44:58.567
there anyone else in the
story that's completing

00:44:58.567 --> 00:44:59.867
the work for him?

00:44:59.867 --> 00:45:05.200
Is there anyone else in the
story that actually finishes

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.533
the task that is
begun by Billy?

00:45:08.533 --> 00:45:12.533
And obviously, if we turn to
the ending of the story, we

00:45:12.533 --> 00:45:16.733
see that there's a very crucial
conversation between

00:45:16.733 --> 00:45:19.267
the doctor and the doctor's
wife, the two people who are

00:45:19.267 --> 00:45:21.867
named in the title
of the story.

00:45:21.867 --> 00:45:26.133
"'Dear, I don't think, I really
don't think that anyone

00:45:26.133 --> 00:45:30.067
would really do a thing
like that.' 'No?' 'No.

00:45:30.067 --> 00:45:32.367
I can't really believe that
anyone would do a thing of

00:45:32.367 --> 00:45:36.900
that sort intentionally.'" And
the doctor is saying that Dick

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:39.100
is picking up a fight so that
he wouldn't have to pay the

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:42.900
medical bills, that this is all
intentional on the part of

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.000
Dick, that getting into a
fight would mean that

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.633
everything would be off between
the two of them, no

00:45:48.633 --> 00:45:49.967
medical bills to be paid.

00:45:49.967 --> 00:45:53.200
The doctor's wife
is saying no.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.000
So she's saying that OK,
no, that's not likely.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.600
"The doctor stood up and put
the shotgun in the corner

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.133
behind the dresser.

00:46:02.133 --> 00:46:05.300
'Are you going out, dear?'
his wife said.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.567
'I think I'll go for a walk,'
the doctor said.

00:46:08.567 --> 00:46:12.233
'If you see Nick, dear, will you
tell him his mother wants

00:46:12.233 --> 00:46:17.633
to see him?' his wife
said." It's an

00:46:17.633 --> 00:46:21.400
interesting thing to say.

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:26.000
It's not surprising for the wife
to say, OK, if you see

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.767
our son, tell him to come in.

00:46:28.767 --> 00:46:31.633
Except that right after she says
that, and the doctor goes

00:46:31.633 --> 00:46:35.233
out, he slams the door.

00:46:35.233 --> 00:46:39.033
And the wife catches her breath
as he goes out and

00:46:39.033 --> 00:46:40.800
slams the door.

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.633
So let's think for a moment
about the two things

00:46:44.633 --> 00:46:45.467
that the wife says.

00:46:45.467 --> 00:46:50.633
One is that she doubts that
Dick is picking a fight so

00:46:50.633 --> 00:46:52.933
that he wouldn't have to
pay the medical bills.

00:46:52.933 --> 00:46:57.567
And the other thing that she
says is if you see Nick, tell

00:46:57.567 --> 00:46:59.267
him that I want to see
him, and he should

00:46:59.267 --> 00:47:01.433
come in to see me.

00:47:01.433 --> 00:47:04.133
What is the effect
of saying that?

00:47:04.133 --> 00:47:07.000
The doctor says that to Nick.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.900
What does Nick do?

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.033
He says, I want to
go with you.

00:47:11.033 --> 00:47:14.333
He doesn't want to go in
to see his mother.

00:47:14.333 --> 00:47:17.700
He doesn't want to go in the
house to see his mother.

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:25.733
So the effect of the mother
saying I want to see Nick

00:47:25.733 --> 00:47:29.500
actually has the effect of that
is demonstrated in the

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:32.500
ending of the story, is
that Nick is going

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.967
to go with his father.

00:47:35.967 --> 00:47:43.767
And we can't think of a better
companion, a better tool for

00:47:43.767 --> 00:47:49.300
the mother to use to stop the
doctor from getting into a

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:53.500
fight with his Native
American workers.

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:58.933
As long as Nick is there, we
know that he's never going to

00:47:58.933 --> 00:48:00.733
get into a fight.

00:48:00.733 --> 00:48:04.000
So the way I'm reading
the story--

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.700
and you know, obviously a
conjectural reading--

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:12.767
but this is the best the
doctor's wife can do as a

00:48:12.767 --> 00:48:19.033
peacemaker, is to engineer a
scenario in which a fight is

00:48:19.033 --> 00:48:21.967
highly unlikely to take place.

00:48:21.967 --> 00:48:25.800
And it turns out that she is an
expert in engineering that

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:31.233
scenario by telling Nick to
come in to see her, she's

00:48:31.233 --> 00:48:37.533
succeeded in exactly achieving
the outcome of the story, Nick

00:48:37.533 --> 00:48:40.933
going off with his father to
see the black squirrels, no

00:48:40.933 --> 00:48:42.400
violence happening.

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.133
So we can say that the three--

00:48:45.133 --> 00:48:47.533
the two stories and the
inter-chapter--

00:48:47.533 --> 00:48:54.733
that together all three of them
perform an all-around

00:48:54.733 --> 00:48:58.667
meditation on violence
and pain.

00:48:58.667 --> 00:49:02.933
One pointing in the direction of
the naturalness of violence

00:49:02.933 --> 00:49:08.700
and pain, the other pointing
in the equal naturalness of

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:13.100
peace prevailing, that it
doesn't have to be.

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:15.100
Violence doesn't have to be.

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:18.767
Pain to others, pain to oneself
doesn't have to be.

00:49:18.767 --> 00:49:20.400
It could be stopped.

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.667
It could be prevented.

00:49:21.667 --> 00:49:25.767
So I would say this is very
typical structure in

00:49:25.767 --> 00:49:31.433
Hemingway, is to give us
meditation on both sides of

00:49:31.433 --> 00:49:36.867
the spectrum, testing both
possibilities, and allowing

00:49:36.867 --> 00:49:38.700
the three to be in dialogue.

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.967
So as far as I can see, I think
that Hemingway is right,

00:49:41.967 --> 00:49:45.000
that everything, in fact, hangs
on everything else, and

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.067
we really should see them in
relation to one another.

00:49:49.067 --> 00:49:51.933
So we'll come back on Thursday
and we'll try out another way

00:49:51.933 --> 00:49:53.167
of clustering the stories.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.675
Professor Mark Saltzman:
So, today we're going to

00:00:14.675 --> 00:00:18.043
continue talking about imaging.
Last Tuesday--on Tuesday I

00:00:18.043 --> 00:00:22.154
talked mainly about imaging
using X-rays and the

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:27.226
conventional sorts of X-ray
which a chest X-ray which leads

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:31.195
to a projected image.
So, you understand the

00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:36.050
limitations of projected images,
and from X-rays something about

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.520
the physics of how an X-ray
image is formed based on X-rays

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.366
passing through your body.
Depending on what tissues,

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.943
what types of tissues the X-ray
passes through,

00:00:46.943 --> 00:00:49.520
some of that X-ray energy will
be absorbed.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.129
Therefore, only a fraction of
it is available to pass all the

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.970
way through your body and expose
the X-ray film.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.222
We're going to talk about
several alternate forms of

00:01:02.222 --> 00:01:05.702
imaging today,
many of which are similar to CT

00:01:05.702 --> 00:01:08.755
imaging.
Now, CT imaging is a special

00:01:08.755 --> 00:01:13.461
form of X-ray imaging where you
rotate the source of X-rays and

00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:17.939
the detector around the object
you're trying to image around

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.970
the patient.
You take images at a large

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.557
number of angles and using
mathematical approaches you

00:01:27.557 --> 00:01:32.722
reconstruct the three
dimensional image from those

00:01:32.722 --> 00:01:37.150
multiple two dimensional
projections.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.542
That mathematical process is
called reconstruction from back

00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:45.860
projections and it results in a
three dimensional image,

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.961
in a CT a slice of the object
of the patient is obtained by

00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:57.432
rotating the source in the
detector around that axial

00:01:57.432 --> 00:02:23.499
location.
What we're going to start

00:02:23.499 --> 00:03:10.342
with is talking about an
alternate to CT--we're going to

00:03:10.342 --> 00:03:58.889
talk about an alternate to CT
which forms the same kind of

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:10.961
images.
That is, images of an axial

00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:13.430
location, maybe a transverse
image;

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.850
a slice from the body will be
imaged using a technique called

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.819
magnetic resonance as an
alternative to using X-rays.

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:27.128
We talked last time about one
of the problems with X-rays,

00:04:27.128 --> 00:04:30.321
that X-rays had a lot of
beneficial qualities for making

00:04:30.321 --> 00:04:32.397
images.
They pass through tissues,

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:35.770
they allow you to look inside,
they're absorbed selectively by

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.153
tissues of different density,
they're able to expose X-ray

00:04:40.153 --> 00:04:45.006
film, and all of those
properties make them very good

00:04:45.006 --> 00:04:48.653
for forming images.
The problem is that

00:04:48.653 --> 00:04:53.603
X-rays--X-ray radiation is a
form of ionizing radiation that

00:04:53.603 --> 00:04:58.050
can cause damage to cells and
tissues in the body.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.026
One has to be careful about how
much dose you expose a

00:05:03.026 --> 00:05:07.403
particular patient to.
In magnetic resonance

00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:12.669
imaging, you use magnetic fields
and radio frequency radiation,

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.850
non-ionizing forms of radiation
in order to form an image.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.879
The kind of image you form is
the same.

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:25.569
You form a three dimensional
image of objects,

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.779
but since the physics is
different,

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:31.657
the things that create contrast
or your ability to see one

00:05:31.657 --> 00:05:35.739
object from another in an MR
image are different than in a CT

00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:37.650
image.
In a CT image,

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.660
what forms the contrast is the
absorbance of X-rays by the

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.574
tissue.
So, your lungs,

00:05:44.574 --> 00:05:47.952
which are mostly air,
allow X-rays to pass through

00:05:47.952 --> 00:05:51.508
relatively easily.
They're different from soft

00:05:51.508 --> 00:05:55.960
tissue like blood or the muscle
tissue of your heart which

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.607
absorbs some of those X-rays,
and they're different from

00:05:59.607 --> 00:06:01.459
bone, which absorb a lot of
those X-rays.

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:05.623
It's density of the tissue,
absorbance of the X-rays that

00:06:05.623 --> 00:06:08.606
leads to contrast.
One of the things I didn't

00:06:08.606 --> 00:06:11.199
talk about last time was that
sometimes physicians,

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:15.550
when they want to images of
objects where there's not a lot

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.685
of intrinsic contrast--like,
say, you want to look at the

00:06:19.685 --> 00:06:23.724
intestine, but if you take an
X-ray of the abdomen everything

00:06:23.724 --> 00:06:27.300
appears like soft tissue,
everything looks about the same.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.605
If you, however,
fill up the intestines with air

00:06:31.605 --> 00:06:37.376
by feeding air to the patient or
by somehow getting air into the

00:06:37.376 --> 00:06:41.317
intestinal tract,
then that image will appear

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:44.493
dark where that air is.
You can create contrast,

00:06:44.493 --> 00:06:47.550
you can see what's inside of
the intestine that way.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.624
Another way you can do it is by
having the patient drink

00:06:50.624 --> 00:06:53.977
something that absorbs X-rays
very readily and that something

00:06:53.977 --> 00:06:58.362
is usually a solution of barium,
a colloidal barium solution

00:06:58.362 --> 00:07:02.778
that's very X-ray dense.
So, you can create contrast

00:07:02.778 --> 00:07:04.511
that way;
a digression,

00:07:04.511 --> 00:07:08.858
something I didn't mention last
time and it is mentioned in the

00:07:08.858 --> 00:07:11.213
chapter.
What I want to talk about

00:07:11.213 --> 00:07:14.599
MR is different way of forming
images, uses a different kind of

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:16.622
physics,
and so the elements of

00:07:16.622 --> 00:07:18.819
intrinsic contrast are
different.

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:25.790
We'll talk about what makes MR
images in a few moments.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:30.634
Bone does not appear well on MR
images, whereas,

00:07:30.634 --> 00:07:36.509
bone appeared very well in
X-rays and CT's for example.

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:41.105
If you've taken chemistry,
some chemistry in college or in

00:07:41.105 --> 00:07:44.410
high school, you've probably
heard of NMR,

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:49.452
nuclear magnetic resonance.
It was discovered by chemists

00:07:49.452 --> 00:07:52.959
as a way of analyzing chemical
samples.

00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:56.457
It turns out that if you put
certain nuclei,

00:07:56.457 --> 00:08:00.279
if you put certain atoms in a
magnetic field,

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:03.812
some of them will align with
the magnetic field because they

00:08:03.812 --> 00:08:07.790
have a magnetic dipole;
atoms have a magnetic dipole.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:15.103
Hydrogen atoms or protons have
an odd number of nuclei,

00:08:15.103 --> 00:08:20.264
of neutrons or protons.
Because of that they have a

00:08:20.264 --> 00:08:23.312
dipole, a magnetic dipole.
You put them in a magnetic

00:08:23.312 --> 00:08:25.709
field, they will align with that
magnetic field.

00:08:25.709 --> 00:08:29.996
If you then perturb the
molecules that are aligned with

00:08:29.996 --> 00:08:34.282
the magnetic field using radio
frequency waves or other

00:08:34.282 --> 00:08:37.776
magnetic fields,
we'll talk about this in a

00:08:37.776 --> 00:08:42.029
moment, then you can measure
something about the properties

00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:45.242
of the atom.
Chemists use this,

00:08:45.242 --> 00:08:51.003
because it turns out that if
you align all the hydrogen atoms

00:08:51.003 --> 00:08:55.259
or protons in a sample,
if you align them in a magnetic

00:08:55.259 --> 00:08:58.381
field and then you stimulate
them with the right kind of

00:08:58.381 --> 00:09:01.787
radio frequency,
they will respond by producing

00:09:01.787 --> 00:09:06.598
a radio frequency of their own,
by producing an energy emission

00:09:06.598 --> 00:09:09.487
of their own.
That energy emission is at

00:09:09.487 --> 00:09:12.720
radio frequency wavelengths and
you can detect it.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.713
Protons that are in different
environments will respond

00:09:17.713 --> 00:09:21.387
slightly differently.
A proton that is--or a

00:09:21.387 --> 00:09:25.398
hydrogen--I'm going to say
proton instead of hydrogen atom

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:28.974
because that's easier to say,
or hydrogen ion,

00:09:28.974 --> 00:09:33.773
a proton that's in a fatty
solution will behave differently

00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:39.070
when stimulated in a magnetic
field than one that's in water.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:43.320
One that's in bone will behave
even differently than that.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.929
The properties that you can
measure by this process called

00:09:46.929 --> 00:09:50.603
nuclear magnetic resonance
depend not only on the atom that

00:09:50.603 --> 00:09:54.066
you're stimulating,
hydrogen in this case,

00:09:54.066 --> 00:09:59.356
but the microenvironment or
local surrounding that the atom

00:09:59.356 --> 00:10:03.189
finds itself in.
If you talked about this in

00:10:03.189 --> 00:10:06.913
chemistry, you might talk about
distinguishing different

00:10:06.913 --> 00:10:10.164
hydrogen ions that are
associated with an alcohol

00:10:10.164 --> 00:10:13.844
molecule or with a benzene ring,
and how ones that are in

00:10:13.844 --> 00:10:16.585
different positions on the
molecule will actually respond

00:10:16.585 --> 00:10:18.659
differently,
give you what chemists call

00:10:18.659 --> 00:10:21.837
different chemical shifts.
It's that same phenomenon

00:10:21.837 --> 00:10:24.850
that's being used here to create
images.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:29.532
It was discovered in 1946 that
atomic nuclei could absorb and

00:10:29.532 --> 00:10:32.930
reemit radio frequency energy,
and particularly,

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.259
when they were aligned in a
magnetic field.

00:10:35.259 --> 00:10:38.959
That led this discovery of the
nuclear magnetic resonance

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:41.387
concept;
led to the Nobel Prize in

00:10:41.387 --> 00:10:44.718
Physics in 1952.
It's called nuclear magnetic

00:10:44.718 --> 00:10:48.291
resonance because it
involves--it depends on the

00:10:48.291 --> 00:10:51.940
particular properties of the
nuclei of atoms,

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.259
that is the number or protons,
the number or neutrons.

00:10:55.259 --> 00:10:57.891
It's magnetic,
because a magnetic field is

00:10:57.891 --> 00:11:00.330
required in order to align the
ions.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:04.597
It's called resonance because
you're looking for a resonance

00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:07.779
between the excitation of these
molecules,

00:11:07.779 --> 00:11:11.202
these aligned molecules,
aligned in a magnetic field

00:11:11.202 --> 00:11:14.759
which are exciting them with
radio frequency waves.

00:11:14.759 --> 00:11:18.692
You're looking for a particular
resonance between the magnetic

00:11:18.692 --> 00:11:22.430
field that's applied and the
stimulation that you give with

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:25.244
radio frequency.
Now, when I was introducing

00:11:25.244 --> 00:11:27.948
the subject, I didn't call it
nuclear magnetic resonance

00:11:27.948 --> 00:11:30.799
imaging, I called it magnetic
resonance imaging or MRI.

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:35.286
That's the common name that's
used for making medical images

00:11:35.286 --> 00:11:38.480
using this particular physical
approach.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.841
Why do you think the name was
changed from nuclear magnetic

00:11:43.841 --> 00:11:48.649
resonance to MRI during the
1980s when this technique

00:11:48.649 --> 00:11:53.723
started to be used in people?
Anything with nuclear doesn't

00:11:53.723 --> 00:11:56.759
sound so good.
You don't want anything with

00:11:56.759 --> 00:12:00.313
nuclear done to you,
probably because of other uses

00:12:00.313 --> 00:12:04.364
of nuclei and concerns about
nuclear sources of energy and

00:12:04.364 --> 00:12:07.159
that kind of thing,
so the name was changed.

00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:11.565
I don't want you to be confused
because the phenomenon is the

00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:13.974
same.
To perform magnetic

00:12:13.974 --> 00:12:19.080
resonance and to make magnetic
resonance images you need a very

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.206
strong magnetic field.
Magnetic fields,

00:12:22.206 --> 00:12:26.070
if you remember from physics,
are measured in a unit called

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.813
Tesla.
Most of the clinical units that

00:12:29.813 --> 00:12:35.694
are used to perform magnetic
resonance images have magnetic

00:12:35.694 --> 00:12:39.750
fields ranging from 1.5 to 4.0
Tesla.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.899
A Tesla, another unit for that
is the Gauss and the conversion

00:12:43.899 --> 00:12:46.716
factor shown here.
Just to put it in perspective,

00:12:46.716 --> 00:12:48.852
you know that the Earth has a
magnetic field,

00:12:48.852 --> 00:12:51.710
that's why compasses work;
has a magnetic field.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:55.144
If you have a compass which is
just a device that detects the

00:12:55.144 --> 00:12:57.834
Earth's magnetic field always
aligns with North,

00:12:57.834 --> 00:13:01.953
for example.
The magnetic field of the Earth

00:13:01.953 --> 00:13:07.843
is about .3 Gauss or--and it
ranges between .3 and .6 so a

00:13:07.843 --> 00:13:13.733
Gauss is a--that would convert
to--.6 Gauss converts to 60

00:13:13.733 --> 00:13:18.312
micro-Tesla.
So 60 x 10^(-6) Tesla is the

00:13:18.312 --> 00:13:23.656
magnetic field of the Earth,
we're talking about much,

00:13:23.656 --> 00:13:27.789
much higher magnetic fields
than that.

00:13:27.789 --> 00:13:32.434
You'll need to know this
because you're going to go down

00:13:32.434 --> 00:13:37.000
and visit the MR research center
at Yale this afternoon.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.562
Magnetic fields of this
strength can interact with other

00:13:40.562 --> 00:13:44.188
magnetic objects like credit
cards that you might have in

00:13:44.188 --> 00:13:46.724
your pockets,
or keys that you have in your

00:13:46.724 --> 00:13:48.708
pockets.
So when you enter an MR suite,

00:13:48.708 --> 00:13:51.478
you have to make sure that
you're not carrying anything

00:13:51.478 --> 00:13:53.278
metal,
wearing anything metal,

00:13:53.278 --> 00:13:56.477
or carrying anything magnetized
that has a risk of being

00:13:56.477 --> 00:13:59.851
demagnetized with it because
these are very strong magnetic

00:13:59.851 --> 00:14:02.864
fields.
Because of this the MR facility

00:14:02.864 --> 00:14:07.494
that you will see here at Yale
is in the basement of The Anlyan

00:14:07.494 --> 00:14:11.750
Center and usually these
machines are in the basement.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.830
If you got to a hospital
and you have an MR taken;

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:16.410
usually you go down to the
basement.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.948
Why is that?
Because they're put in rooms

00:14:18.948 --> 00:14:21.897
that are specially shielded,
they're specially shielded so

00:14:21.897 --> 00:14:25.259
that the magnetic fields cannot
penetrate outside of the room.

00:14:25.259 --> 00:14:28.860
That's so that people that are
walking by on the street don't

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.582
have their credit cards erased.
People that are walking by on

00:14:32.582 --> 00:14:35.826
the street don't have metal
objects pulled out of their

00:14:35.826 --> 00:14:38.169
hands by the strong magnetic
fields.

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:42.078
This is one of the risks for
people that work around nuclear

00:14:42.078 --> 00:14:45.309
magnetic resonance imaging,
is that the fields are so

00:14:45.309 --> 00:14:48.296
strong that any metal object
that's in the vicinity of the

00:14:48.296 --> 00:14:50.340
magnetic can be become a
projectile.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:54.652
They're very cautious about
metal, another reason why we

00:14:54.652 --> 00:14:59.592
asked you not to take any stuff
that's unnecessary with you when

00:14:59.592 --> 00:15:03.669
you go down to The Anlyan Center
this afternoon.

00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:05.730
The magnetic fields are very
strong.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:09.430
Anybody had an MR image
taken?

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:13.281
Wilma, several of you;
it was a device,

00:15:13.281 --> 00:15:15.429
it might not have looked
exactly like this but looked

00:15:15.429 --> 00:15:18.441
something like this.
This looks similar to the CAT

00:15:18.441 --> 00:15:22.778
scanner I showed you last time,
in that there is an instrument

00:15:22.778 --> 00:15:27.186
with a--basically a big cylinder
with a cylindrical hole in the

00:15:27.186 --> 00:15:30.773
middle.
This hole, this is where the

00:15:30.773 --> 00:15:35.751
patient is going to go,
the patient will be lying on

00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:38.912
this cart,
and this will act like a

00:15:38.912 --> 00:15:43.799
conveyor belt that will move the
patient inside the cylinder.

00:15:43.799 --> 00:15:47.157
It's close-fitting,
you don't want the size of the

00:15:47.157 --> 00:15:51.212
cylinder to be too far away from
the patient because you want the

00:15:51.212 --> 00:15:55.014
magnetic field forces and the
radio waves that are emitted by

00:15:55.014 --> 00:15:58.942
the ions in your--by the atoms
in your body to be very close to

00:15:58.942 --> 00:16:01.730
the detectors that are measuring
it.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.000
Because of this,
when you're inside,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.919
many people--Wilma did you
experience this?

00:16:06.919 --> 00:16:10.049
You feel claustrophobic when
you're inside the machine

00:16:10.049 --> 00:16:13.178
because you're in a very
confined space and the images

00:16:13.178 --> 00:16:16.666
take some time to acquire.
The quality of the image

00:16:16.666 --> 00:16:21.028
depends on the strength of the
magnetic field and how long you

00:16:21.028 --> 00:16:24.623
acquire the image.
If you have more time to wait

00:16:24.623 --> 00:16:28.378
you can get a better image,
and so there's a tradeoff

00:16:28.378 --> 00:16:32.350
between building magnets that
are incredibly strong,

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:37.321
which is very expensive and
time for the patient to be

00:16:37.321 --> 00:16:42.574
inside the instrument to acquire
an image that has a high

00:16:42.574 --> 00:16:46.011
quality.
Surrounding this cylinder

00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:49.837
are coils and coils,
many miles of coils of wire,

00:16:49.837 --> 00:16:54.106
and electrical field.
Electricity passes through

00:16:54.106 --> 00:16:59.454
these wires in order to create a
big electromagnet and large

00:16:59.454 --> 00:17:02.990
magnetic fields within this
machine.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.796
Now, the other thing about the
machine is that the operator can

00:17:06.796 --> 00:17:09.619
control the strength of the
magnetic fields,

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:13.569
it can control stimulation of
the object with radio frequency

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:17.649
waves, and it can control what
radio frequency signals it picks

00:17:17.649 --> 00:17:21.341
up from the object as well.
One of the advantages of MR,

00:17:21.341 --> 00:17:24.997
and we'll see a little bit more
about this as we go through the

00:17:24.997 --> 00:17:27.119
physics, is that it can be
tuned.

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:31.468
You can tune the imaging method
in order to look at the kinds of

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:34.230
things that you would like to
look at.

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:37.529
That turns out to be one of the
powerful things about MR.

00:17:37.529 --> 00:17:41.279
People are still discovering
new ways to look at the

00:17:41.279 --> 00:17:45.617
resonance between the magnetic
field and its affect on atoms

00:17:45.617 --> 00:17:49.220
and the radio frequencies that
are generated,

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.490
to learn how make new kinds of
images.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:54.950
We'll talk about some of that
as we go.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.958
The magnetic resonance
that's most done in people for

00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:01.342
clinical imaging takes advantage
of the fact that our bodies are

00:18:01.342 --> 00:18:04.835
largely water.
All those water molecules have

00:18:04.835 --> 00:18:07.950
hydrogen atoms associated with
them.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:12.213
There's a lot of hydrogen in
your body, and hydrogen atoms

00:18:12.213 --> 00:18:16.476
are susceptible to magnetic
resonance because they contain

00:18:16.476 --> 00:18:20.890
this dipole moment that will
align in a magnetic field.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:24.057
What happens in magnetic
resonance is you're placed in a

00:18:24.057 --> 00:18:28.677
very large magnetic field.
Many of the hydrogen nuclei

00:18:28.677 --> 00:18:34.206
in the molecules within your
body align with this magnetic

00:18:34.206 --> 00:18:37.801
field,
and then the machine sort of

00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:42.369
tips those aligned molecules out
of alignment.

00:18:42.369 --> 00:18:46.056
If that's done properly,
you will start a kind of motion

00:18:46.056 --> 00:18:49.139
in these molecules,
what's called a procession,

00:18:49.139 --> 00:18:51.819
where the molecules move like a
top.

00:18:51.819 --> 00:18:54.703
When they are performing this
kind of motion within the

00:18:54.703 --> 00:18:57.052
magnetic field,
they're trying to get back to

00:18:57.052 --> 00:18:59.882
the preferred alignment but
they're doing that in this

00:18:59.882 --> 00:19:02.572
top-like fashion.
If you have many,

00:19:02.572 --> 00:19:07.305
many atoms that are all
processing in the right way they

00:19:07.305 --> 00:19:12.296
will emit radio frequency waves
that you can detect in this

00:19:12.296 --> 00:19:15.258
cylinder outside.
This shows it sort of

00:19:15.258 --> 00:19:18.203
schematically.
You have atoms inside your

00:19:18.203 --> 00:19:22.190
body, these are hydrogen atoms,
for example.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.201
You place the body within a
strong magnetic field,

00:19:25.201 --> 00:19:28.582
and these atoms align so that
they are parallel with the

00:19:28.582 --> 00:19:31.083
magnetic field,
which is going from top to

00:19:31.083 --> 00:19:33.593
bottom here.
You stimulate these atoms with

00:19:33.593 --> 00:19:37.220
radio frequency waves and you
knock them out of alignment.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.864
Now, you can't just stimulate
them with any radio frequency

00:19:40.864 --> 00:19:44.759
wave, that radio frequency wave
has to be exactly right for the

00:19:44.759 --> 00:19:49.470
atoms that you want to move.
It has to be radio waves that

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:55.057
are at the correct frequency or
wavelength to stimulate these

00:19:55.057 --> 00:19:59.072
particular atoms.
That's one of the things that

00:19:59.072 --> 00:20:02.858
makes MR so versatile,
in that if you stimulate them

00:20:02.858 --> 00:20:06.273
with one frequency,
you can manipulate hydrogen

00:20:06.273 --> 00:20:09.105
atoms.
If you stimulate them with

00:20:09.105 --> 00:20:12.980
another frequency,
you can stimulate other atoms.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:17.359
Now, the reason why most of
the images you'll see are based

00:20:17.359 --> 00:20:21.880
on protons or hydrogen nuclei is
because hydrogen is so much more

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.200
abundant than everything else in
your body,

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.450
and so you get a good signal
with that.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.694
If you were stimulating other
kinds of atoms,

00:20:29.694 --> 00:20:32.703
you wouldn't get as strong a
signal, you wouldn't be able to

00:20:32.703 --> 00:20:35.634
make as good an image.
You stimulate these atoms with

00:20:35.634 --> 00:20:38.201
a radio frequency,
they begin this motion or this

00:20:38.201 --> 00:20:40.403
procession,
and this just shows

00:20:40.403 --> 00:20:44.230
schematically that this
procession is like a top.

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:48.609
They're out of alignment,
the nuclei are rotating.

00:20:48.609 --> 00:20:51.927
They're eventually coming back
to their equilibrium position

00:20:51.927 --> 00:20:54.569
which would be aligned with the
magnet again.

00:20:54.569 --> 00:21:00.297
What you measure in the MR
device is this relaxation from

00:21:00.297 --> 00:21:05.718
the excited or tipped position,
relaxing back to their

00:21:05.718 --> 00:21:11.144
equilibrium or aligned position.
Now, if you go on--if any

00:21:11.144 --> 00:21:14.634
of you go on to study quantum
mechanics or you try to study

00:21:14.634 --> 00:21:19.196
the physics of medical imaging,
particularly MR in more detail,

00:21:19.196 --> 00:21:23.905
you'll learn that this simple
description I gave you is not

00:21:23.905 --> 00:21:27.311
entirely accurate.
It's not inaccurate,

00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:30.799
but it doesn't describe the
whole thing.

00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:34.572
It's really a quantum mechanics
phenomenon that's happening with

00:21:34.572 --> 00:21:36.927
the molecules here.
It can't be described

00:21:36.927 --> 00:21:40.169
completely unless you have the
sort of tools of quantum physics

00:21:40.169 --> 00:21:43.328
to describe it,
but this is a sufficient way of

00:21:43.328 --> 00:21:46.190
thinking about what's going on
in here.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:49.354
What you measure,
then, is the relaxation of

00:21:49.354 --> 00:21:52.990
these excited molecules back to
their aligned state.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.683
You can measure that because as
these molecules are processing

00:21:56.683 --> 00:22:00.680
they're emitting radio frequency
radiation which you can detect.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:05.359
Now, this involves magnetic
fields, strong magnetic fields.

00:22:05.359 --> 00:22:10.071
It involves radio frequency
radiation, the kind of radiation

00:22:10.071 --> 00:22:14.223
that radio stations use to
broadcast signals that are

00:22:14.223 --> 00:22:19.055
picked up by antennas.
These are generally presumed to

00:22:19.055 --> 00:22:24.295
be safe for biological tissues.
There's no ill effects that we

00:22:24.295 --> 00:22:28.845
know of, of exposure to magnetic
fields or radio frequency

00:22:28.845 --> 00:22:33.037
radiation at these wavelengths.
So, it doesn't have the same

00:22:33.037 --> 00:22:36.046
concerns that X-ray radiation or
other kinds of radiation,

00:22:36.046 --> 00:22:38.579
which I'll talk about in a few
minutes, have.

00:22:38.579 --> 00:22:40.839
This is some examples of MR
images.

00:22:40.839 --> 00:22:45.368
These are MR images that are
taken at different locations in

00:22:45.368 --> 00:22:47.511
the brain.
Remember, now,

00:22:47.511 --> 00:22:52.399
that the patient is being
conveyed on this table into the

00:22:52.399 --> 00:22:57.199
core of the instrument and
measurements are made only on

00:22:57.199 --> 00:23:02.000
the part of the body that's
inside the instrument.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.665
Just like in CT image,
you move the patient through

00:23:05.665 --> 00:23:10.210
and you take images of different
slices through the patient.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:14.821
Now, if the patient is having a
brain or head MR scan,

00:23:14.821 --> 00:23:19.867
you would just put them in
until you went through this part

00:23:19.867 --> 00:23:22.450
of the body.
If you're doing it in the

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:24.735
abdomen or the leg,
you would just scan that part

00:23:24.735 --> 00:23:27.251
of the body.
This shows, then,

00:23:27.251 --> 00:23:33.609
images, transverse images at
various locations moving down.

00:23:33.609 --> 00:23:36.789
This is near the top of the
head, this a little further

00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:38.849
down, you can see the
ventricles.

00:23:38.849 --> 00:23:41.728
I think actually these two
images might be from the same

00:23:41.728 --> 00:23:44.460
location, but they show you one
of the features of MR.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.663
That is, by looking at
different relaxations or

00:23:47.663 --> 00:23:51.285
stimulating with different
pulses of radio frequency,

00:23:51.285 --> 00:23:54.349
you can see different kinds of
contrast.

00:23:54.349 --> 00:23:58.122
In this image you can see more
clearly the distinction between

00:23:58.122 --> 00:24:01.600
gray matter and white matter.
In this image you don't see

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.895
that so clearly but you see
better the distinction between

00:24:04.895 --> 00:24:08.075
brain tissue and the cerebral
spinal fluid that's in the

00:24:08.075 --> 00:24:11.671
ventricles.
The point is that the technique

00:24:11.671 --> 00:24:16.240
can be tuned to see what you
would like to see best.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:21.269
Then, going farther down in the
brain you see--now you're seeing

00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:26.140
some of the bones of the face
and the cerebellum back here,

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:30.177
or a lower section of the brain.
So, this is a section probably

00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:34.779
from somewhere in here and this
is even lower down than that.

00:24:34.779 --> 00:24:38.279
These are just examples of some
magnetic resonance images.

00:24:38.279 --> 00:24:40.492
As I mentioned,
magnetic resonance is not so

00:24:40.492 --> 00:24:43.459
good at looking at bone because
bone doesn't have a lot of water

00:24:43.459 --> 00:24:45.443
in it.
Doesn't have a lot of--so it

00:24:45.443 --> 00:24:48.469
doesn't contribute a lot of
signal but it's very good for

00:24:48.469 --> 00:24:51.009
looking at differences between
soft tissues.

00:24:51.009 --> 00:24:55.553
Remember in CT soft tissues
like the muscular wall of the

00:24:55.553 --> 00:25:00.015
heart and the blood that's
inside the heart look roughly

00:25:00.015 --> 00:25:02.847
the same.
You can't distinguish those

00:25:02.847 --> 00:25:05.349
well, there's not intrinsic
contrast.

00:25:05.349 --> 00:25:09.233
With MR there is intrinsic
contrast because those--the

00:25:09.233 --> 00:25:13.483
properties of those different
tissues are different by this

00:25:13.483 --> 00:25:16.167
method.
A newer form of magnetic

00:25:16.167 --> 00:25:19.854
resonance imaging is called
functional MR imaging and it

00:25:19.854 --> 00:25:23.706
uses the same machine.
It uses the same approach,

00:25:23.706 --> 00:25:28.646
but instead of designing your
radio frequency pulses so that

00:25:28.646 --> 00:25:31.660
you look at the static
structure,

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:35.279
you design it so that you're
particularly sensitive for

00:25:35.279 --> 00:25:39.662
looking at flowing blood.
You can actually measure the

00:25:39.662 --> 00:25:44.990
velocity of blood flow in
different regions of the brain.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:48.309
Now, you can do that because
blood contains a lot of water.

00:25:48.309 --> 00:25:52.362
This is water that's not
static, just staying in one

00:25:52.362 --> 00:25:56.176
place in the brain,
but it's moving through blood

00:25:56.176 --> 00:25:59.110
vessels.
You can detect the motion of

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:01.869
the blood vessels with this
technique.

00:26:01.869 --> 00:26:04.891
It can also tell the
difference between saturated and

00:26:04.891 --> 00:26:07.480
desaturated blood.
What's saturated blood?

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.365
Here, I mean blood that's
saturated with oxygen,

00:26:10.365 --> 00:26:14.118
so it's loaded up with oxygen;
desaturated blood is blood

00:26:14.118 --> 00:26:17.878
that's had the oxygen removed.
Now, if you can measure blood

00:26:17.878 --> 00:26:20.855
flow and you can measure
differences between saturated

00:26:20.855 --> 00:26:24.574
and desaturated blood,
that means that you can monitor

00:26:24.574 --> 00:26:28.978
within a small region of tissue
how much blood flow is going

00:26:28.978 --> 00:26:31.430
through,
how much oxygen is being

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:33.394
consumed.
You can measure,

00:26:33.394 --> 00:26:38.210
locally, what's the rate of
oxygen consumption in a tissue.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:41.405
Now, if you know oxygen
consumption, then you know

00:26:41.405 --> 00:26:44.539
something about metabolic
activity in that tissue.

00:26:44.539 --> 00:26:48.108
A region of tissue that's
consuming a lot of oxygen is

00:26:48.108 --> 00:26:50.525
doing a lot of work.
In the brain,

00:26:50.525 --> 00:26:54.481
if you find regions of tissue
that are consuming oxygen,

00:26:54.481 --> 00:26:58.797
that means those are regions of
tissue where there's a lot of

00:26:58.797 --> 00:27:02.817
energy being consumed,
those are regions of tissue

00:27:02.817 --> 00:27:07.358
where there's a lot of neural
activity, a lot of brain cells

00:27:07.358 --> 00:27:11.089
doing what brain cells do.
It's called functional MR

00:27:11.089 --> 00:27:14.509
imaging because through this
approach, one can look inside

00:27:14.509 --> 00:27:16.346
the brain,
for example,

00:27:16.346 --> 00:27:20.569
and find regions that are
performing functions.

00:27:20.569 --> 00:27:23.798
An experiment that--well,
the other thing about fMRI

00:27:23.798 --> 00:27:25.970
before I talk about the
experiment,

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:28.474
is that instead of just looking
at anatomy now,

00:27:28.474 --> 00:27:31.415
this is a high resolution
picture of the anatomy of the

00:27:31.415 --> 00:27:34.349
brain,
an fMRI image is fuzzier.

00:27:34.349 --> 00:27:38.351
You don't have as high a
resolution and that's because

00:27:38.351 --> 00:27:42.730
you want to take images fast,
you don't want to wait a long

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:45.730
time.
You want to be--you want to see

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:49.323
how the image changes with time.
In a static image,

00:27:49.323 --> 00:27:52.131
when they took a picture of
Wilma for example,

00:27:52.131 --> 00:27:55.626
they kept her inside the
machine for a while so that they

00:27:55.626 --> 00:27:58.497
could get a really high
resolution image of the

00:27:58.497 --> 00:28:01.724
structure in her brain.
She was asked to remain very

00:28:01.724 --> 00:28:03.999
still because you don't want to
have any motion,

00:28:03.999 --> 00:28:06.079
you want just a picture of the
static's.

00:28:06.079 --> 00:28:10.103
In fMRI, you want to take a
picture faster but then you want

00:28:10.103 --> 00:28:14.264
to look at how it changes with
time because it's these changes

00:28:14.264 --> 00:28:17.742
in time that allow you to look
at things like oxygen

00:28:17.742 --> 00:28:21.964
consumption.
You have to look over time in

00:28:21.964 --> 00:28:26.560
order to measure that.
In an fMRI--in one kind of

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.743
fMRI imaging you look at blood
oxygen level,

00:28:29.743 --> 00:28:32.630
that's a measure of neural
activity,

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:36.738
when blood oxygen goes up
neural activity goes up,

00:28:36.738 --> 00:28:42.019
the extraction of oxygen goes
up and the fMRI signal goes up.

00:28:42.019 --> 00:28:46.140
Here's an example of an fMRI
image, and actually the fMRI

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:49.387
image isn't shown here.
The fMRI image would be a

00:28:49.387 --> 00:28:52.539
blurry one like the one I showed
you in the last slide.

00:28:52.539 --> 00:28:57.010
You might find regions where
there's high levels of activity,

00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:01.554
and you would superimpose those
on a static image of that same

00:29:01.554 --> 00:29:04.662
brain,
so here two kinds of imaging

00:29:04.662 --> 00:29:07.690
were done.
One was the high resolution MR

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:11.750
imaging to get a picture of the
anatomy, and then this more

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:15.460
rapid time sequence of images to
find out where oxygen

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.333
consumption was occurring.
What was discovered was

00:29:19.333 --> 00:29:22.929
that oxygen consumption is
occurring in this location here

00:29:22.929 --> 00:29:26.886
and this location here.
This is known to be a certain

00:29:26.886 --> 00:29:32.080
area of the brain called Broca's
area that's involved in speech.

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:38.973
I don't remember whether it's
in hearing and decoding speech

00:29:38.973 --> 00:29:41.977
or in producing speech,
I think it's in hearing and

00:29:41.977 --> 00:29:44.440
decoding speech but I don't
remember.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.995
In this particular example
mixed speech was--while the

00:29:48.995 --> 00:29:53.895
patient was being imaged they
were being exposed to speech

00:29:53.895 --> 00:29:57.420
that included a mixture of
languages,

00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:02.549
both Spanish and English.
In this picture they were only

00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:05.644
listening to Spanish,
in this picture they were only

00:30:05.644 --> 00:30:08.797
listening to English.
What you see is that when the

00:30:08.797 --> 00:30:11.900
mixed--under the mixed
condition, when they're hearing

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.292
both Spanish and English,
there's a certain portion of

00:30:15.292 --> 00:30:19.048
the brain that's more active
than it is with only Spanish and

00:30:19.048 --> 00:30:22.108
only English.
From this you can conclude that

00:30:22.108 --> 00:30:25.294
this part of the brain must be
involved, somehow,

00:30:25.294 --> 00:30:28.946
in the special activity that
was happening at this point

00:30:28.946 --> 00:30:31.690
here.
That is some kind of mixed

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:35.296
language experience.
Many, many--this as you

00:30:35.296 --> 00:30:39.504
could extrapolate from this,
and you could imagine that this

00:30:39.504 --> 00:30:43.927
approach where you could look at
what areas of the brain become

00:30:43.927 --> 00:30:46.710
active during sorts of
activities,

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:50.265
certain sorts of behavior,
when certain emotions are

00:30:50.265 --> 00:30:54.309
elicited, has become a very
powerful tool in psychology.

00:30:54.309 --> 00:30:58.227
You can do psychological
experiments while patients are

00:30:58.227 --> 00:31:01.854
getting fMRI scans,
and you can find out what parts

00:31:01.854 --> 00:31:05.771
of the brain are involved in
that kind of psychological

00:31:05.771 --> 00:31:08.702
response.
This imaging is teaching us a

00:31:08.702 --> 00:31:12.450
lot more than just what is the
normal structure of tissue,

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:16.447
in this case the brain looks
like, but how does it really

00:31:16.447 --> 00:31:19.660
work in a functioning animal
like a person.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.539
That's a very brief
introduction to MR imaging,

00:31:22.539 --> 00:31:24.900
there's a lot more to learn
about this,

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.498
you'll learn more about this,
and you'll see some of these

00:31:27.498 --> 00:31:32.663
instruments this afternoon.
There's more detail in the book

00:31:32.663 --> 00:31:36.461
as well.
A second kind of imaging which

00:31:36.461 --> 00:31:41.287
shares an advantage with MR in
that it does not involve

00:31:41.287 --> 00:31:45.220
ionizing radiation is ultrasound
imaging.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:49.770
Ultrasound imaging is different
from the others we've talked

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:53.627
about in that there is no
electromagnetic radiation

00:31:53.627 --> 00:31:56.703
involved.
You're not using light or

00:31:56.703 --> 00:32:01.259
different forms of light;
you're using sound to create

00:32:01.259 --> 00:32:05.053
images instead.
Sounds is pressure waves that

00:32:05.053 --> 00:32:09.097
transmit through a medium.
When I'm talking up here my

00:32:09.097 --> 00:32:12.739
vocal apparatus is creating
waves of pressure in the air

00:32:12.739 --> 00:32:15.519
which get transmitted through
the room.

00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:20.336
You can understand them because
the waves of pressure that I'm

00:32:20.336 --> 00:32:25.389
creating stimulate your eardrums
at the right frequencies and you

00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:29.364
convert that into sound.
Ultrasound uses much,

00:32:29.364 --> 00:32:33.529
much higher frequencies of
sound than our ears can detect.

00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:37.407
We detect, I forget exactly
what the range is,

00:32:37.407 --> 00:32:42.060
but up to I think 40,000 Hz or
cycles per second is the

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:47.058
frequency and this is in the
megaHertz range or millions of

00:32:47.058 --> 00:32:51.877
Hertz range,
so it's higher frequency sounds

00:32:51.877 --> 00:32:57.176
than you can hear.
Some have very short--of these

00:32:57.176 --> 00:33:03.329
high frequency sound waves have
very short wavelengths.

00:33:03.329 --> 00:33:06.420
They can penetrate through
tissues.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:10.700
Ultrasound allows for good
imaging of anatomical structure.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.333
It's also a fast imaging
method, and so it can allow you

00:33:14.333 --> 00:33:18.297
to look at motion in ways that
are difficult to do using some

00:33:18.297 --> 00:33:23.069
of these other techniques,
and I'll tell you about that.

00:33:23.069 --> 00:33:26.171
The way that ultrasound
works is you have to get sound

00:33:26.171 --> 00:33:29.164
waves propagated into the body
and you do that through a

00:33:29.164 --> 00:33:31.940
special device called an
ultrasound transducer.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:35.019
The transducer is placed right
on the surface of your body.

00:33:35.019 --> 00:33:37.904
It might look like a cylinder
like a probe that's placed

00:33:37.904 --> 00:33:39.740
against the surface of your
body.

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.999
Usually not even just placed
against a surface of your body,

00:33:42.999 --> 00:33:45.319
but it's placed with some kind
of a gel,

00:33:45.319 --> 00:33:51.305
a liquid gel such that the
probe comes in very good contact

00:33:51.305 --> 00:33:55.486
with your skin.
That's because sound waves

00:33:55.486 --> 00:33:59.779
don't transmit very easily
across interfaces.

00:33:59.779 --> 00:34:03.526
If I put something up between
my voice and you,

00:34:03.526 --> 00:34:07.028
then the sound waves don't
transmit as well,

00:34:07.028 --> 00:34:10.295
you can't hear it.
Sound waves bounce off

00:34:10.295 --> 00:34:12.759
interfaces.
You want to get the sound to go

00:34:12.759 --> 00:34:15.169
into the skin,
you have to put the transducer,

00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:18.114
which is producing the sound
waves, right up against the

00:34:18.114 --> 00:34:20.428
skin.
You don't want a gap of air in

00:34:20.428 --> 00:34:22.800
between and that's why you put
the gel.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.631
Now, this transducer has a
special material in it that's

00:34:26.631 --> 00:34:30.914
called a piezoelectric material.
Piezoelectric materials have

00:34:30.914 --> 00:34:34.988
the property that if you put a
voltage through them they

00:34:34.988 --> 00:34:37.730
resonate, or they physically
move.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:40.972
In addition,
if you stimulate a

00:34:40.972 --> 00:34:47.242
piezoelectric material with a
moving wave, it will create a

00:34:47.242 --> 00:34:50.831
voltage.
Voltages get transmitted into

00:34:50.831 --> 00:34:53.838
movements.
In this transducer the movement

00:34:53.838 --> 00:34:57.908
gets transmitted into sound
wave--is what produces the sound

00:34:57.908 --> 00:35:02.530
waves that get transmitted into
your skin and through your body.

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:08.058
Because these piezoelectric
materials can both form sound

00:35:08.058 --> 00:35:14.278
when they're stimulated and they
can detect sound and convert it

00:35:14.278 --> 00:35:19.610
into electricity when they're
stimulated by sound,

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:24.092
then the transducer is both
sending out sound waves and

00:35:24.092 --> 00:35:29.543
receiving sound waves back.
These work basically by the

00:35:29.543 --> 00:35:32.980
same principle that an echo
works.

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:38.295
If I shout in the right kind of
a room where there's nothing to

00:35:38.295 --> 00:35:42.409
absorb the sound between me and
the back wall,

00:35:42.409 --> 00:35:45.640
the sound will hit the back
wall and it will be reflected

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:48.628
back to me.
I will hear that sound some

00:35:48.628 --> 00:35:51.760
time interval later.
You've all had the experience

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:55.079
of hearing an echo.
The same thing happens here,

00:35:55.079 --> 00:35:59.967
you transmit sound into the
skin and it moves forward until

00:35:59.967 --> 00:36:03.639
it hits an interface.
Sound doesn't move so well

00:36:03.639 --> 00:36:06.619
across interfaces,
so it moves through your skin

00:36:06.619 --> 00:36:09.030
and it goes down and hits the
bone.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:12.497
There's an interface between
materials here that have two

00:36:12.497 --> 00:36:14.602
different properties:
skin, muscle,

00:36:14.602 --> 00:36:17.261
bone.
At each one of those interfaces

00:36:17.261 --> 00:36:21.532
some of the sound bounces back.
Since the detector is both

00:36:21.532 --> 00:36:25.667
sending sound and receiving
sound, it sends out a sound wave

00:36:25.667 --> 00:36:30.350
and then it gets the sound back.
It can determine how long it

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:35.730
took for the sound to come back.
If I know the speed of sound

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:40.739
and I know how long it took for
an echo to return,

00:36:40.739 --> 00:36:46.729
I can calculate how far away
the object was that created the

00:36:46.729 --> 00:36:51.430
echo or the interference.
Ultrasound works by sending out

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:54.085
sound waves that bounce back,
are received,

00:36:54.085 --> 00:36:58.005
and the machine calculates how
long it took for this echo to go

00:36:58.005 --> 00:37:02.067
out and come back.
Then, it knows there must have

00:37:02.067 --> 00:37:06.500
been some kind of an object at
that distance away.

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:10.793
Does that make sense?
Ultrasound creates echo time

00:37:10.793 --> 00:37:14.760
maps and calculates depths from
that.

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:37.367
Here's an ultrasound image
of the heart and it's the heart

00:37:37.367 --> 00:37:40.708
turned upside down.
This vaguely familiar to you

00:37:40.708 --> 00:37:44.554
from a few weeks ago,
but the atria are on the top

00:37:44.554 --> 00:37:49.579
and the--or the atria are on the
bottom and the ventricles are on

00:37:49.579 --> 00:37:52.281
the top.
That's just to show you in

00:37:52.281 --> 00:37:56.224
alignment with this image here.
The probe is placed on the

00:37:56.224 --> 00:37:59.539
chest, for example,
and it's moved from side to

00:37:59.539 --> 00:38:03.552
side at one location.
So, what you see is an image of

00:38:03.552 --> 00:38:07.675
what the probe can see as it
sort of sweeps out this cone

00:38:07.675 --> 00:38:11.680
where the sound is moving.
What you see is that there are

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.548
boundaries between light and
dark regions here,

00:38:14.548 --> 00:38:17.789
and those correspond to
boundaries in the tissue.

00:38:17.789 --> 00:38:21.898
You can see the right atrium,
you can see the right ventricle

00:38:21.898 --> 00:38:24.264
over here.
You can see the left atrium and

00:38:24.264 --> 00:38:27.154
the left ventricle because the
white region is the muscular

00:38:27.154 --> 00:38:29.875
tissue of the heart,
and the darker region is the

00:38:29.875 --> 00:38:33.688
blood that's within the heart.
Now, you'll notice that

00:38:33.688 --> 00:38:38.284
it's kind of a--it's not a sharp
image like the images that I

00:38:38.284 --> 00:38:42.114
showed you with CT,
or the images that I showed you

00:38:42.114 --> 00:38:44.936
with MR.
It's a noisier image and there

00:38:44.936 --> 00:38:48.224
are--there's a lot of sort of
white spots or dark spots

00:38:48.224 --> 00:38:50.651
throughout it.
Those are things that are

00:38:50.651 --> 00:38:53.380
called speckles,
it's talked about in your book.

00:38:53.380 --> 00:39:00.495
There are random sources of
interference with the ultrasound

00:39:00.495 --> 00:39:03.532
image.
The reason why ultrasound is

00:39:03.532 --> 00:39:07.083
useful is because you can watch
things with time,

00:39:07.083 --> 00:39:10.523
and so you can see motion.
In static pictures it looks

00:39:10.523 --> 00:39:13.062
like a very noisy image,
but if you were watching this

00:39:13.062 --> 00:39:15.650
in real time you would see the
motion of the heart.

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:19.750
The speckles wouldn't be as
obvious because you'd be

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:23.690
noticing more how the walls of
the ventricle move,

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:25.699
for example,
in time.

00:39:25.699 --> 00:39:28.889
That would be very clear from
the image.

00:39:28.889 --> 00:39:32.267
What would also be clear to
you is the motion of the valves,

00:39:32.267 --> 00:39:35.377
and we talked about the very
critical role that valves play

00:39:35.377 --> 00:39:38.725
in the function of your heart.
If your valves aren't working

00:39:38.725 --> 00:39:40.987
right you can't make an
efficient heartbeat,

00:39:40.987 --> 00:39:43.880
that is, a heartbeat that
produces a cardiac output.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:49.216
Ultrasound imaging has been one
of the most used tools for

00:39:49.216 --> 00:39:53.803
looking at valve disease,
and that event is called

00:39:53.803 --> 00:39:57.098
echocardiography.
Have you ever heard of that

00:39:57.098 --> 00:39:59.961
term echocardiography?
Which is basically ultrasound

00:39:59.961 --> 00:40:03.067
of the heart and it's used
principally to look at the

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:05.707
function of your valve,
the mitral valve and the

00:40:05.707 --> 00:40:06.750
tricuspid valve,
here.

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:10.607
If this was a video image you
would see the valves opening and

00:40:10.607 --> 00:40:14.464
closing in correct coordination
hopefully with the contraction

00:40:14.464 --> 00:40:17.558
of the heart.
Ultrasound allows you to look

00:40:17.558 --> 00:40:21.735
at motion, and so to see things
that are moving that would be

00:40:21.735 --> 00:40:24.590
difficult to do with other
techniques.

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:28.155
You also know,
and probably all of you in this

00:40:28.155 --> 00:40:32.229
room have--pictures were taken
of you when you were in

00:40:32.229 --> 00:40:36.522
utero. Ultrasound imaging is
a very common form of fetal

00:40:36.522 --> 00:40:40.050
monitoring now,
where almost every woman who is

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:43.598
pregnant has at least one
ultrasound image taken at some

00:40:43.598 --> 00:40:47.663
course during the pregnancy just
to make sure that the pregnancy

00:40:47.663 --> 00:40:50.718
is proceeding properly.
This is an example of an

00:40:50.718 --> 00:40:52.747
ultrasound image,
it looks the same way,

00:40:52.747 --> 00:40:54.619
an ultrasound image of an
infant.

00:40:54.619 --> 00:41:00.494
This is the kind of ultrasound
imaging machine that you might

00:41:00.494 --> 00:41:04.808
find in an obstetrics office.
You can see,

00:41:04.808 --> 00:41:08.883
in this particular case,
that here's the head of the

00:41:08.883 --> 00:41:12.239
fetus, here's an arm,
here's the torso.

00:41:12.239 --> 00:41:16.746
Again, it's not a very sharp
image, but if you were watching

00:41:16.746 --> 00:41:20.565
this in real time as the
technician moved the probe

00:41:20.565 --> 00:41:23.850
around on the pregnant woman's
abdomen,

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:28.263
you would see the baby moving.
You would be able to

00:41:28.263 --> 00:41:30.897
distinguish parts much more
easily in that way because

00:41:30.897 --> 00:41:33.579
you're moving both the probe and
the baby's moving,

00:41:33.579 --> 00:41:37.052
and you're seeing things from
different angles in real time as

00:41:37.052 --> 00:41:39.829
it's happening.
This is a very common technique.

00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:42.317
I wouldn't be surprised if many
of you, if you don't have a

00:41:42.317 --> 00:41:44.719
picture of yourself in
utero in your scrapbook,

00:41:44.719 --> 00:41:51.774
probably your mother has one
somewhere, all infants of your

00:41:51.774 --> 00:41:55.962
age were ultrasound.
Ultrasound is also a good

00:41:55.962 --> 00:41:58.970
technique for looking at flow.
When you look at flow you're

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:01.800
taking advantage of something
called the Doppler effect.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:06.090
In physics you've probably
heard about the Doppler effect.

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:09.436
A simple way of thinking about
it is if you're standing on the

00:42:09.436 --> 00:42:12.617
street and there's an ambulance
coming towards you or a car

00:42:12.617 --> 00:42:15.579
that's coming towards you and
the horn is honking.

00:42:15.579 --> 00:42:20.508
As the car is approaching you,
you hear a certain frequency of

00:42:20.508 --> 00:42:23.659
sound that changes as the car
passes.

00:42:23.659 --> 00:42:27.190
The frequency of the sound that
you hear depends both on the

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:30.719
frequency of the sound that's
being emitted by the siren and

00:42:30.719 --> 00:42:34.250
the speed that the ambulance is
moving relative to you.

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:37.824
When the ambulance is moving
towards you, you hear a

00:42:37.824 --> 00:42:42.239
frequency that's offset from the
real frequency of the siren.

00:42:42.239 --> 00:42:46.982
When it's moving away from you
its offset even more and you can

00:42:46.982 --> 00:42:49.446
hear that.
If I'm doing ultrasound

00:42:49.446 --> 00:42:52.481
imaging, imaging with sound
waves, of an object that's

00:42:52.481 --> 00:42:56.699
moving away from the probe,
I can detect both where it is

00:42:56.699 --> 00:43:01.955
and how fast it's moving by the
frequency of the signal that's

00:43:01.955 --> 00:43:06.697
returned to the probe.
That allows you to image the

00:43:06.697 --> 00:43:11.689
rate of blood flow through
vessels, and that's shown in

00:43:11.689 --> 00:43:14.739
this picture here.
You can measure the rate of

00:43:14.739 --> 00:43:16.960
blood flow through the carotid
arteries, for example.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.325
That turns out to be a very
useful technique for patients

00:43:20.325 --> 00:43:22.610
that have cerebral vascular
disease.

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:27.130
They're getting arthrosclerosis
or hardening of the arteries in

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:31.140
the important vessels going up
to their neck that can be

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:35.296
measured--through their neck up
to their brain that can be

00:43:35.296 --> 00:43:39.624
measured using ultrasound.
Those two methods--magnetic

00:43:39.624 --> 00:43:42.520
resonance ultrasound having the
big advantage,

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.480
that they don't involve
ionizing radiation.

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:49.003
Magnetic resonance imaging in
general takes a long time,

00:43:49.003 --> 00:43:51.309
requires very expensive
equipment.

00:43:51.309 --> 00:43:54.599
Ultrasound imaging can be done
in real time.

00:43:54.599 --> 00:43:58.940
You can take pictures,
images of the inside rapidly.

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:02.661
The equipment is not so
expensive, so any doctor's

00:44:02.661 --> 00:44:05.699
office can have an ultrasound
machine.

00:44:05.699 --> 00:44:10.048
The image quality is not as
high, but you can image things

00:44:10.048 --> 00:44:14.887
that are in motion.
These imaging approaches are

00:44:14.887 --> 00:44:21.940
used for different applications
because of the advantages that

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:25.053
each one has.
I want to talk briefly

00:44:25.053 --> 00:44:31.128
about nuclear medicine.
I'm going to have to go fast

00:44:31.128 --> 00:44:33.645
here.
This does use a form of

00:44:33.645 --> 00:44:35.748
ionizing radiation,
in particular,

00:44:35.748 --> 00:44:38.659
gamma rays.
Gamma rays are produced by

00:44:38.659 --> 00:44:42.000
nuclear events,
events inside the nucleus;

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.609
in particular,
they happen when radioactive

00:44:45.609 --> 00:44:49.958
isotopes decay.
When radioactive isotopes like

00:44:49.958 --> 00:44:55.254
Zenon-133, Technetium-99,
Iodine-123, these are unstable

00:44:55.254 --> 00:45:00.149
isotopes of these molecules.
So, with a certain frequency,

00:45:00.149 --> 00:45:03.309
they will decay back to their
more stable form.

00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:06.692
When they decay,
they emit a form of radiation

00:45:06.692 --> 00:45:09.699
called gamma radiation,
many of these.

00:45:09.699 --> 00:45:12.966
Gamma rays--remember on the
electromagnetic spectrum,

00:45:12.966 --> 00:45:16.078
they were up there with X-rays,
high frequency,

00:45:16.078 --> 00:45:19.680
short wavelength radiation,
penetrates easily through

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.489
tissue but is also an example of
ionizing radiation.

00:45:23.489 --> 00:45:27.629
Now, the difference between
nuclear medicine and--what's

00:45:27.629 --> 00:45:31.278
called nuclear medicine and
conventional X-rays is in

00:45:31.278 --> 00:45:34.433
X-rays,
the X-ray source was outside of

00:45:34.433 --> 00:45:37.969
you and you were being bombarded
with X-rays.

00:45:37.969 --> 00:45:41.738
In nuclear medicine,
the gamma ray source is

00:45:41.738 --> 00:45:45.836
injected inside of you.
What you measure is the amount

00:45:45.836 --> 00:45:49.038
of radiation that comes out.
Now, what's the advantage of

00:45:49.038 --> 00:45:51.778
that?
Well, the advantage is if I can

00:45:51.778 --> 00:45:55.964
find radioisotopes that
concentrate in certain regions

00:45:55.964 --> 00:46:00.150
of your body and I inject those
isotopes into you,

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:03.301
and then measure where they
are, I can measure the function

00:46:03.301 --> 00:46:05.530
of that particular region of
your body.

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:10.656
The first imaging that was
done was done in the thyroid and

00:46:10.656 --> 00:46:15.370
your thyroid has a very active
mechanism for concentrating

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:18.549
iodine.
Because of that if I feed

00:46:18.549 --> 00:46:24.269
somebody radioactive iodine that
iodine will accumulate in their

00:46:24.269 --> 00:46:27.809
thyroid gland which is in your
neck.

00:46:27.809 --> 00:46:31.021
The rate at which it
accumulates and the pattern at

00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:34.296
which it accumulates can
indicate whether you have a

00:46:34.296 --> 00:46:38.099
healthy or a diseased thyroid.
If I, then, take images of the

00:46:38.099 --> 00:46:41.447
thyroid after I've injected the
radioactivity and I look to see

00:46:41.447 --> 00:46:44.853
if the radioactivity is there,
and how fast it gets there,

00:46:44.853 --> 00:46:48.460
and how fast your body removes
it, then I can learn something

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:51.525
about how your thyroid is
functioning because of its

00:46:51.525 --> 00:46:56.300
ability to concentrate iodine.
That's one example of it.

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:59.804
Imagine you have a chemical
that accumulates in the brain

00:46:59.804 --> 00:47:02.139
and accumulates only in certain
areas.

00:47:02.139 --> 00:47:04.553
For example,
you have a chemical that's

00:47:04.553 --> 00:47:08.363
related to the neurotransmitter
dopamine and you give it to a

00:47:08.363 --> 00:47:12.110
patient that you suspect of
having Parkinson's Disease.

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:15.544
Well, Parkinson's Disease
involves the brain neurons that

00:47:15.544 --> 00:47:19.286
process and use dopamine and so
if this radio chemical goes up

00:47:19.286 --> 00:47:22.843
into the brain it's going to
interact with those cells that

00:47:22.843 --> 00:47:25.420
are involved in Parkinson's
Disease.

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.359
By watching how this molecule
moves around in the brain I can

00:47:29.359 --> 00:47:33.299
learn about how your brain is
processing dopamine and if it's

00:47:33.299 --> 00:47:35.860
responding in a normal sort of
way.

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:39.987
Does that make sense?
The advantage of nuclear

00:47:39.987 --> 00:47:43.328
medicine is that you're
designing very specific kinds of

00:47:43.328 --> 00:47:46.730
radioactive molecules that you
can put into the body.

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:50.364
The molecules are designed to
illuminate some kind of

00:47:50.364 --> 00:47:52.949
biological function,
not structure.

00:47:52.949 --> 00:47:57.770
Then, I measure the time course
of how those objects--how those

00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:01.579
radio labeled compounds move
through your body.

00:48:01.579 --> 00:48:03.869
There are several ways of
measuring it.

00:48:03.869 --> 00:48:05.909
I'm just going to show you the
simple one here;

00:48:05.909 --> 00:48:10.121
not simple one but a very
powerful one called Positron

00:48:10.121 --> 00:48:14.170
Emission Tomography.
Here the chemical that's

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:19.345
emitted is a special radio
isotope that emits not gamma

00:48:19.345 --> 00:48:23.946
rays but another
nuclear--another particle called

00:48:23.946 --> 00:48:26.941
a positron.
When positrons are emitted,

00:48:26.941 --> 00:48:30.079
they will move through tissue
until they hit an electron.

00:48:30.079 --> 00:48:33.809
Positrons don't have to move
very far, there's lots of

00:48:33.809 --> 00:48:37.439
electrons around in tissues.
When a positron hits an

00:48:37.439 --> 00:48:41.269
electron, they annihilate one
another and they generate two

00:48:41.269 --> 00:48:44.440
gamma rays which move in
opposite directions.

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:48.677
If I have a positron emitting
substance in the brain,

00:48:48.677 --> 00:48:52.590
it will emit gamma rays which
can be detected.

00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:55.540
Because I'm detecting one here
and one here,

00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:58.559
I know exactly where the source
came from.

00:48:58.559 --> 00:49:02.316
I can trace it back along the
lines where I detected the gamma

00:49:02.316 --> 00:49:05.887
rays and I can find out where
the positron emitting element

00:49:05.887 --> 00:49:08.547
was.
So, I can make very nice maps

00:49:08.547 --> 00:49:12.657
of the brain like these that
show you where the positron

00:49:12.657 --> 00:49:16.020
emitting isotope accumulates in
the brain.

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:21.036
This is called PET imaging.
I'm going to skip over this

00:49:21.036 --> 00:49:24.281
one which tells you a little bit
about the economics of these

00:49:24.281 --> 00:49:27.199
different modalities.
Ultrasound, as I mentioned,

00:49:27.199 --> 00:49:28.950
was cheaper;
CT costs more,

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:32.487
MR in general cost more,
PET imaging costs even more

00:49:32.487 --> 00:49:36.440
because you have to generate
radio isotopes locally at the

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:39.121
source too.
In general you need a cyclotron

00:49:39.121 --> 00:49:42.164
or some kind of a machine to
generate these radio isotopes as

00:49:42.164 --> 00:49:43.796
well.
There are other things you have

00:49:43.796 --> 00:49:46.090
to think about if you're
thinking about installing these,

00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:50.860
is how much do they cost to
operate and how heavily do

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:56.619
technicians have to be involved
in order to keep them working.

00:49:56.619 --> 00:49:59.826
The last thing I want to
talk about is optical imaging,

00:49:59.826 --> 00:50:02.872
and as I mentioned last time,
I think that during your

00:50:02.872 --> 00:50:06.202
lifetime we're going to see a
lot of new approaches for using

00:50:06.202 --> 00:50:09.582
light to image inside the body.
That's a problem because light

00:50:09.582 --> 00:50:12.220
doesn't penetrate through your
body, it bounces off;

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:15.218
most of it bounces off.
That's why we can see each

00:50:15.218 --> 00:50:18.293
other, because we're seeing the
reflected light off of different

00:50:18.293 --> 00:50:23.146
objects.
You can use light to look at

00:50:23.146 --> 00:50:27.589
biological objects.
You can look at them in great

00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:29.840
detail this way and that's what
microscopes do.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:34.169
They allow you to use light
radiation in order to look at

00:50:34.169 --> 00:50:37.340
magnified images of biological
objects.

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:41.397
We've gotten very good at
designing microscopes that allow

00:50:41.397 --> 00:50:44.530
us to look at,
in very sophisticated ways,

00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:47.389
at biological objects on the
stage of a microscope.

00:50:47.389 --> 00:50:50.632
This just shows you an
image, it's actually very

00:50:50.632 --> 00:50:54.320
similar to the CT scans or MR
scans I showed you before,

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:57.995
in that these are different
optical sections taken from a

00:50:57.995 --> 00:51:01.079
pollen grain.
A pollen grain is very small.

00:51:01.079 --> 00:51:04.375
Here's an image from the bottom
moving up, moving up,

00:51:04.375 --> 00:51:08.178
moving up--this shows you all
the three dimensional detail of

00:51:08.178 --> 00:51:11.579
this particular pollen grain.
You can reconstruct in three

00:51:11.579 --> 00:51:13.869
dimensions and see what it looks
on the outside,

00:51:13.869 --> 00:51:16.893
or you could look and see what
it's like at any point in its

00:51:16.893 --> 00:51:19.329
interior structure.
We're very sophisticated at

00:51:19.329 --> 00:51:22.500
using light to make images like
this now on microscope stages.

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:26.147
One could take very beautiful
pictures of biological objects

00:51:26.147 --> 00:51:29.610
like cells with different kinds
of optical techniques.

00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:33.829
Here's--this is familiar to
you, this is a glomerulus.

00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:36.210
I told you what a glomerulus
was last week,

00:51:36.210 --> 00:51:39.269
but this shows sort of the tuft
of capillaries inside a

00:51:39.269 --> 00:51:41.650
glomerulus imaged by light
microscopy.

00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:45.156
Well, how do I take advantage
of this kind of microscopy but

00:51:45.156 --> 00:51:47.889
look at these kinds of images
inside people?

00:51:47.889 --> 00:51:50.491
We don't how to do that yet,
but we do have some

00:51:50.491 --> 00:51:53.480
technologies for looking
at--using light to look inside

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.750
and the main one is called
endoscopy.

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:59.520
Endoscopy involves objects
called fiber optics,

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:04.356
and fiber optics allow you to
not only focus light through a

00:52:04.356 --> 00:52:09.929
lens but to take that light and
bounce it down an optical shaft.

00:52:09.929 --> 00:52:15.559
I could take a light beam and
shine it here into a fiber.

00:52:15.559 --> 00:52:19.646
That fiber has a special
coating on which then allows the

00:52:19.646 --> 00:52:22.929
light to bounce all the way down
the fiber.

00:52:22.929 --> 00:52:25.705
I can bend the fiber,
and because the bouncing

00:52:25.705 --> 00:52:28.974
depends on the coating and not
the shape of the fiber,

00:52:28.974 --> 00:52:31.380
the light will turn with the
fiber.

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:34.934
This is how fiber optics works;
it's described a little bit

00:52:34.934 --> 00:52:38.354
more in detail in your book.
One can design devices like

00:52:38.354 --> 00:52:40.937
this endoscope.
This endoscope you can look

00:52:40.937 --> 00:52:43.489
through this end here,
it has a light source.

00:52:43.489 --> 00:52:47.224
That light source shines
through fiber optics that you

00:52:47.224 --> 00:52:50.324
can bend around,
and that light comes out the

00:52:50.324 --> 00:52:52.474
outside.
If the light comes out the

00:52:52.474 --> 00:52:55.433
outside it hits some biological
object and then bounces back

00:52:55.433 --> 00:52:57.639
light, reflects light and you
can see it.

00:52:57.639 --> 00:53:00.652
You can look inside objects
where you can put this

00:53:00.652 --> 00:53:03.661
endoscope.
This endoscope is designed to

00:53:03.661 --> 00:53:08.603
go--a patient will swallow it.
This end will go down in their

00:53:08.603 --> 00:53:13.380
mouth, past their vocal chords,
through their esophagus,

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:15.592
into the stomach,
and then out of the stomach

00:53:15.592 --> 00:53:18.660
into the duodenum or the first
part of the small intestine.

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:21.187
That's what's shown here.
This is the valve that's

00:53:21.187 --> 00:53:24.662
leading from stomach into the
duodenum or the first part of

00:53:24.662 --> 00:53:27.836
the small intestine.
You can see what the lining of

00:53:27.836 --> 00:53:30.710
the small intestine and the
stomach looks like.

00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:34.787
This has been a very important
diagnostic approach for using

00:53:34.787 --> 00:53:37.760
light to image the lining of the
stomach.

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:40.201
What would you be looking for?
Things like ulcers,

00:53:40.201 --> 00:53:44.652
things like cancers,
any kind of disturbance in the

00:53:44.652 --> 00:53:48.480
normal anatomy of the lining of
the gut.

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:53.161
I think you're going to see a
lot of new methods beyond this

00:53:53.161 --> 00:53:56.970
for using light to look inside
people as well.

00:53:56.970 --> 00:53:58.000
I'll stop there.
Thanks.

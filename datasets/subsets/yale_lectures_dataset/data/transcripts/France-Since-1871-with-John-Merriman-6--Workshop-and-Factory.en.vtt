00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.393
Professor John
Merriman: Today I want to

00:00:05.393 --> 00:00:10.110
talk about large-scale
industrialization and workers.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.894
Let me say a couple of things,
a couple of general points that

00:00:14.894 --> 00:00:17.228
are important,
is that--well,

00:00:17.228 --> 00:00:21.234
two things at the beginning,
first of all everywhere,

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:24.470
and particularly in the case in
France,

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.359
the Industrial Revolution was
first and foremost a

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.486
continuation of forms of
production that were already

00:00:32.486 --> 00:00:34.820
there;
that we've over-emphasized the

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.798
kind of technological advances,
the super inventions of the

00:00:37.798 --> 00:00:40.160
eighteenth century in the
textile industry,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.424
and that even in Britain--and
some of you have heard me say

00:00:44.424 --> 00:00:48.615
this in the context of another
course--traditional ways of

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:52.916
producing things,
artisanal and domestic industry

00:00:52.916 --> 00:00:57.630
involving women doing outwork,
or domestic industry,

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.771
was essential to the process.
The second Industrial

00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:05.150
Revolution really depends on
when you want start it up,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.280
really from the mid-1850s on,
is more what--the classical

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.967
kind of way that we've come to
consider large-scale

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:17.262
industrialization,
that is, with electricity and

00:01:17.262 --> 00:01:21.869
steel, in the other order,
and large-scale units of

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.938
production.
So, that's really the first

00:01:24.938 --> 00:01:26.987
point.
And the second point is that

00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:30.049
for a very long time people who
did economic history,

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.890
often whom were economists,
tended to see Britain as this

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.730
sort of classic case of
large-scale industrialization,

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.188
and even used the most
unfortunate word,

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:49.179
"retarded," when describing
large-scale French

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.210
industrialization.
And the reason they kind of

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.680
blundered into that kind of
analysis that really missed the

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.227
point is that if you added up
the number of factories with x

00:02:02.227 --> 00:02:06.507
number of workers,
or if you added up the number

00:02:06.507 --> 00:02:10.138
of steam engines,
that France lagged behind

00:02:10.138 --> 00:02:13.064
Britain.
But, until the mid-nineteenth

00:02:13.064 --> 00:02:16.944
century France is the second
largest industrial economy in

00:02:16.944 --> 00:02:20.228
the world,
and then gradually overtaken by

00:02:20.228 --> 00:02:24.639
Germany and then eventually
lapped by the United States.

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:30.355
But, one of the reasons why
these economic historians argue

00:02:30.355 --> 00:02:36.563
that France couldn't become the
major industrial leader was that

00:02:36.563 --> 00:02:42.180
capital formation was less
easily achieved in France,

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.881
because the banking and
insurance facilities were not

00:02:45.881 --> 00:02:49.440
that, to be sure,
of the equal of Great Britain.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.651
Also, one of the advantages
that England had in large-scale

00:02:53.651 --> 00:02:56.410
industrialization was its
geography,

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.636
that you had--one of the
reasons why the first railroad

00:03:00.636 --> 00:03:04.549
in the world in about 1827--no,
earlier than that,

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.244
actually about 1819,
I guess it is--was in England,

00:03:08.244 --> 00:03:11.401
north of here,
is that it was carrying coal

00:03:11.401 --> 00:03:14.524
down to the sea,
and there's nowhere in England

00:03:14.524 --> 00:03:18.530
that's more than seventy-five
miles away from the ocean.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.700
In France you had the kinds of
mine deposits that are so

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.894
important.
In Germinal,

00:03:24.894 --> 00:03:28.408
you've got them in the Nord,
here, you've got them in

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:31.180
Alsace--of course,
that's disappeared.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.721
You have them down in the
Aveyron, in the Decazeville,

00:03:33.721 --> 00:03:36.022
and you have them here and
there in other places,

00:03:36.022 --> 00:03:38.180
particularly around
Saint-Étienne.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.519
But they are far from--it's
very difficult to transport coal

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.830
and so that was really kind of
the problem.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.411
But, if you look at large-scale
industrialization in France it

00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:53.190
still proceeds rather
dramatically,

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.949
but in the French way,
still involving artisanal

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:01.355
production, craft production,
in Paris and in other cities,

00:04:01.355 --> 00:04:04.209
and still involving,
until quite late in the

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.150
century,
rural industry.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.102
As a matter of fact,
just take an example that I

00:04:10.102 --> 00:04:12.490
always use because I love the
place,

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.229
if you take Reims- r-e-i-m-s-
here, industrial production,

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.243
it was a major textile center.
You think of it as being an

00:04:21.243 --> 00:04:24.402
ecclesiastical center because of
the coronation of the kings and

00:04:24.402 --> 00:04:27.259
all that business and the
magnificent cathedral rebuilt by

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:30.067
the Americans after World War I
and the Basilica of Saint

00:04:30.067 --> 00:04:32.583
Rémi,
but in the 1840s and '50s you

00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:35.765
still--well, 1830s and 40s--you
still had all sorts of rural

00:04:35.765 --> 00:04:39.269
industry that's sort of putting
out work into the countryside,

00:04:39.269 --> 00:04:43.065
done largely by women,
and then gradually you have the

00:04:43.065 --> 00:04:46.360
growth of large-scale industrial
production,

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.440
in the context of factories.
But, well into the 1870s you

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.863
still have something like 75,000
embroiderers,

00:04:54.863 --> 00:04:58.363
mostly women again,
living in the hinterland of

00:04:58.363 --> 00:05:01.207
Nancy.
And in 1871 the average unit of

00:05:01.207 --> 00:05:05.156
production in Paris--and Paris
was the region with the biggest

00:05:05.156 --> 00:05:09.560
industrial center of France--had
only seven people working in it.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.432
So, if you're looking for huge
sweatshops, huge factories that

00:05:13.432 --> 00:05:17.463
you would find in Manchester,
and Sheffield and places like

00:05:17.463 --> 00:05:21.731
that, they were pretty rare in
France, and indeed some of the

00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:24.720
biggest units of production were
mines.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.199
By the way, Germinal is
really about the Anzin mines,

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.616
and they're in the north,
the north of France,

00:05:32.616 --> 00:05:35.418
and Anzin is right,
a couple of kilometers

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:39.862
northwest of Valenciennes,
so right near the Belgian

00:05:39.862 --> 00:05:42.158
border.
But, over the long run

00:05:42.158 --> 00:05:45.313
that--and into this course,
the 1850s and '60s,

00:05:45.313 --> 00:05:49.187
which is before this course,
but--the large-scale

00:05:49.187 --> 00:05:53.730
industrialization develops more
and more in France.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.043
And, as in Britain,
and as in other places,

00:05:57.043 --> 00:06:01.383
in order to have investment in
industry you have to have

00:06:01.383 --> 00:06:04.761
capital,
you have to have a sort of

00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:10.092
surplus of capital and you have
to have a way of feeding a

00:06:10.092 --> 00:06:13.819
growing population,
only very slowly in the case of

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:16.200
France, as you know.
And, so, there is an increase

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.097
in production,
in rural production that makes

00:06:18.097 --> 00:06:20.872
this possible,
sort of an agricultural

00:06:20.872 --> 00:06:25.047
revolution that takes place,
that certainly has,

00:06:25.047 --> 00:06:29.389
as we'll see in a week or so,
big problems with the

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:33.459
phylloxera epidemic killing off
the vineyards of France,

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:36.290
which is so important to
agricultural production.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.880
But you have to eat as well as
drink, and so there is an

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.660
increase in production of
agriculture all over the place.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.053
And, so, this is very important.
And just another point,

00:06:45.053 --> 00:06:48.087
ten--until ten years ago people
still talked about the Long

00:06:48.087 --> 00:06:50.454
Depression,
and it's a very unfortunate

00:06:50.454 --> 00:06:54.207
term because it gave the sense
that the Depression that gripped

00:06:54.207 --> 00:06:57.558
Europe between 1873,
1874 and the mid-1890s was in

00:06:57.558 --> 00:07:01.542
any way comparable to the Great
Depression in industrialized

00:07:01.542 --> 00:07:03.741
countries,
and in not so industrialized

00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:06.448
countries.
But the industrial depression

00:07:06.448 --> 00:07:10.826
from 1929--and in the case of
the US, the US doesn't really

00:07:10.826 --> 00:07:15.506
get out of it until the massive
arms production following Pearl

00:07:15.506 --> 00:07:19.780
Harbor in World War II.
It is a depression,

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:26.147
it's characterized by low
prices, so you don't have these

00:07:26.147 --> 00:07:32.031
big sort of catastrophic dips,
but it's a depression which

00:07:32.031 --> 00:07:36.452
undercuts the economy in some
way, and particularly hurts

00:07:36.452 --> 00:07:41.109
rural people because the prices
of agricultural goods are so

00:07:41.109 --> 00:07:43.276
low.
But nonetheless if you

00:07:43.276 --> 00:07:47.250
just--this is not an economics
course but it's good to have a

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.230
few figures nonetheless--if you
look here,

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:54.227
the percentage of the
population working in industry

00:07:54.227 --> 00:07:58.459
in France in 1876 is 27.6
percent of the population,

00:07:58.459 --> 00:08:01.596
and in 1896,
twenty years later,

00:08:01.596 --> 00:08:05.227
it's 29.2 percent.
So, it's quite clear,

00:08:05.227 --> 00:08:09.590
France is still a peasant
society, even though many people

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.530
have foots in both worlds.
Miners, for example,

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.487
working in, oh,
in mines in the south of France

00:08:17.487 --> 00:08:21.715
in a place called Camot,
which I'll come back to in

00:08:21.715 --> 00:08:25.965
awhile, a small town in the
town, they were both miners and

00:08:25.965 --> 00:08:29.629
agricultural--they're farmers
and day laborers.

00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:33.320
And it's the same thing in
other mines of the Decazeville.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.988
But, still, the number of
people whose principle activity

00:08:36.988 --> 00:08:40.793
is industry increases.
And France also urbanizes at

00:08:40.793 --> 00:08:44.067
the same time.
Now, the percentage of the

00:08:44.067 --> 00:08:48.143
population in 1872 that are
urban is twenty percent,

00:08:48.143 --> 00:08:51.340
21.1 percent,
or something like that.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:56.556
In 1901 it's 40.9 percent.
Now, you're going to think boy,

00:08:56.556 --> 00:08:59.260
France is really urbanized,
but that's completely

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.740
misleading because to be urban
in France,

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.341
as of the census of 1841,
you had to have 2,000 people,

00:09:06.341 --> 00:09:09.675
and that's all.
An example I always give is

00:09:09.675 --> 00:09:13.866
there are 2,000 people outside
the Meriden Mall when it opens

00:09:13.866 --> 00:09:16.870
sometimes, or the Boston Post
Road Mall.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:20.594
I mean, 2,000 people does not
seem like a major urban

00:09:20.594 --> 00:09:24.012
agglomeration.
So, France still is--the level

00:09:24.012 --> 00:09:27.573
of urbanization is not
comparable to that of the

00:09:27.573 --> 00:09:31.419
Prussian Rhineland before 1871,
or Germany afterward,

00:09:31.419 --> 00:09:34.427
or the United States.
If you go to the Naugatuck

00:09:34.427 --> 00:09:37.975
Valley and the sort of rustbelt
there--the United States

00:09:37.975 --> 00:09:42.039
urbanizes, the eastern United
States urbanizes very rapidly.

00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:45.366
France, and we'll come back to
this when I talk about cities,

00:09:45.366 --> 00:09:48.291
France does have large cities,
above all Paris,

00:09:48.291 --> 00:09:51.744
but it is primarily an
urbanization of very small

00:09:51.744 --> 00:09:54.909
places of what in French--and in
English,

00:09:54.909 --> 00:09:57.758
the same word--you'd call
bourgs, b-o-u-r-g-s,

00:09:57.758 --> 00:10:00.100
which are market towns
essentially,

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.706
so small towns.
So, we're still dealing with a

00:10:03.706 --> 00:10:07.710
society in which production is
overwhelmingly rural,

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:14.860
but in which France is becoming
a major kind of industrial

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:20.661
producing--a producing country.
And one of the things that

00:10:20.661 --> 00:10:23.345
increases the number of people,
the rate of

00:10:23.345 --> 00:10:26.604
urbanization--urbanization
really is a growth in the

00:10:26.604 --> 00:10:30.502
proportional number of people
living in whatever you define as

00:10:30.502 --> 00:10:33.570
cities--is le grand
départ,

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:37.783
or the big departure,
as rural people leave the

00:10:37.783 --> 00:10:40.990
countryside and move into
cities.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:45.572
And this is one of the great
social happenings of this entire

00:10:45.572 --> 00:10:47.591
period.
And I've probably used this

00:10:47.591 --> 00:10:50.269
statistic before;
if I didn't, I should've;

00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:53.473
and I'll use it again,
that in 1851,

00:10:53.473 --> 00:10:56.676
two-thirds of all the
departments or

00:10:56.676 --> 00:11:02.075
départements in
France had a larger population

00:11:02.075 --> 00:11:07.019
in 1851 than they did in 1939.
So, that's really incredible.

00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:09.897
So, you have really huge growth
in the industrial north,

00:11:09.897 --> 00:11:12.200
and that's what you've been
reading about,

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:17.063
the Nord, that department,
n-o-r-d, and in other areas

00:11:17.063 --> 00:11:20.590
with a big major center,
for example Toulouse,

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.629
which is the fourth or fifth
largest city at that time,

00:11:23.629 --> 00:11:25.635
way in the south,
one of France's most wonderful

00:11:25.635 --> 00:11:27.718
cities.
So, you have departments like

00:11:27.718 --> 00:11:30.765
that that are growing in
population because of people

00:11:30.765 --> 00:11:34.092
leaving the mountains,
people leaving areas of central

00:11:34.092 --> 00:11:36.556
France that simply aren't
rentable,

00:11:36.556 --> 00:11:39.080
you can't make enough money to
survive,

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.259
particularly during an
agricultural depression.

00:11:41.259 --> 00:11:44.854
And the wine disease,
talk about a catastrophe,

00:11:44.854 --> 00:11:48.214
the wine disease knocks out
much production,

00:11:48.214 --> 00:11:53.443
knocks out the way people live.
And down in this part of France

00:11:53.443 --> 00:11:58.271
you already had a huge blow to
the rural economy with another

00:11:58.271 --> 00:12:01.649
disease that comes along and
wipes out,

00:12:01.649 --> 00:12:05.113
or at least severely constrains
the silk industry,

00:12:05.113 --> 00:12:08.421
the raw silk industry.
So, people get up and leave and

00:12:08.421 --> 00:12:11.019
they go--they enter these new
jobs like teaching,

00:12:11.019 --> 00:12:13.431
or clerking,
or working in railroad

00:12:13.431 --> 00:12:17.120
stations, and that transforms
the way people live.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.227
And, so, you have to sort of
see all these things,

00:12:21.227 --> 00:12:26.340
the kind of flow of people back
and forth, and even some flows

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.240
that end.
There was, since the sixteenth

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.836
century, this pattern of
seasonal migration,

00:12:31.836 --> 00:12:33.958
of men,
only men, walking,

00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:39.187
walking every year all the way
from this part of Central France

00:12:39.187 --> 00:12:41.816
to Paris,
to Rouen, to other northern

00:12:41.816 --> 00:12:44.509
cities to work in the
construction industry.

00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:48.147
They started that in the
sixteenth century and they

00:12:48.147 --> 00:12:51.784
walked every March,
and then they'd come back every

00:12:51.784 --> 00:12:53.827
November,
and so most babies,

00:12:53.827 --> 00:12:56.772
if all goes normally,
are born within a three months

00:12:56.772 --> 00:12:59.969
period.
But a huge percentage of the

00:12:59.969 --> 00:13:05.490
male workforce walks in lines of
two all the way to Paris.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.211
You also have these patterns
from the Pyrenees down to

00:13:09.211 --> 00:13:12.160
Barcelona, and from the Alps
down to Milan,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.110
or down to Lyon and those
regions too.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.972
And one of the things that
happens in this course is that

00:13:17.972 --> 00:13:20.885
seasonal migration stops and
those people basically become

00:13:20.885 --> 00:13:24.034
seasonal migrants,
and the areas from which they

00:13:24.034 --> 00:13:27.466
came are de-populated;
depopulation is one of the most

00:13:27.466 --> 00:13:30.588
amazing things about rural
France, and that's what--it

00:13:30.588 --> 00:13:34.181
still--it has been going--well
the last ten years there's been

00:13:34.181 --> 00:13:36.419
a rediscovery of the
countryside,

00:13:36.419 --> 00:13:38.199
and a lot of people retire
there and you have the

00:13:38.199 --> 00:13:39.718
phenomenon, what you call
villages-

00:13:39.718 --> 00:13:41.727
dortoirs,
that are sort of dormitory

00:13:41.727 --> 00:13:44.700
villages where people live when
they're working in the city.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.112
But one of the astonishing
things about seeing all the

00:13:47.112 --> 00:13:48.932
people killed,
you go and you see the war

00:13:48.932 --> 00:13:51.229
monuments,
particularly in the Massif

00:13:51.229 --> 00:13:54.932
Central or places like that,
is that when you see all these

00:13:54.932 --> 00:13:57.353
dead people,
you see the--you can imagine

00:13:57.353 --> 00:14:00.124
their faces, and you see all
their names on these huge

00:14:00.124 --> 00:14:01.531
plaques,
eighty, ninety,

00:14:01.531 --> 00:14:03.583
one-hundred,
and they're just in these

00:14:03.583 --> 00:14:06.854
little teeny towns in which the
countryside has been sort of

00:14:06.854 --> 00:14:10.126
abandoned and now may be bought
up by the British but--as in

00:14:10.126 --> 00:14:12.409
many places.
But, so, the grand

00:14:12.409 --> 00:14:15.045
départ,
the big departure for urban

00:14:15.045 --> 00:14:17.974
areas and new jobs,
is part of this entire scene as

00:14:17.974 --> 00:14:19.745
well.
So, where is industrial

00:14:19.745 --> 00:14:22.529
production in the time we're
talking about in France?

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:26.919
Well where's my little jiffy
statistic?

00:14:26.919 --> 00:14:31.000
But in the north,
that is certainly the case.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.698
62.1 percent of the population
of people in the Nord,

00:14:34.698 --> 00:14:38.937
that you're reading about,
or maybe even have already

00:14:38.937 --> 00:14:42.740
finished this wonderful novel,
are workers.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.439
So, it's the Nord or the
proletarian

00:14:44.439 --> 00:14:47.061
département,
along with the Pas-de-Calais

00:14:47.061 --> 00:14:48.980
next to it.
And the first sort of

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.439
conurbation--a conurbation is
cities that grow so rapidly they

00:14:52.439 --> 00:14:55.930
all come together,
like become one city--is Lille,

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:59.639
which had been there for
centuries and centuries,

00:14:59.639 --> 00:15:02.460
and then Roubaix and Tourcoing,
which just grow up,

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.659
they're little Manchesters in
France.

00:15:04.659 --> 00:15:06.559
You find the same thing around
Saint-Étienne.

00:15:06.559 --> 00:15:11.112
So, big, heavy mining and
textile industry in this part of

00:15:11.112 --> 00:15:13.936
France, for sure.
And the other big industrial

00:15:13.936 --> 00:15:15.336
region, of course,
the biggest,

00:15:15.336 --> 00:15:17.577
is the Paris region.
But the Paris region you're

00:15:17.577 --> 00:15:20.214
still producing these articles
of Paris, that's what they call

00:15:20.214 --> 00:15:22.398
them,
these articles de Paris,

00:15:22.398 --> 00:15:26.015
which are things like wallets
and shoes and fine quality goods

00:15:26.015 --> 00:15:29.039
that are part of the industrial
pride of France.

00:15:29.039 --> 00:15:32.828
When they had these big
expositions in Victorian

00:15:32.828 --> 00:15:37.503
England, these mass produced
things in England that William

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:40.268
Morris,
the sort of sponsor of arts and

00:15:40.268 --> 00:15:42.813
crafts movement,
said it was the age of the

00:15:42.813 --> 00:15:44.815
shoddy.
And the French would always

00:15:44.815 --> 00:15:47.865
proudly say, "we don't turn out
this Victorian kind of junk,

00:15:47.865 --> 00:15:51.651
we make products of quality."
So, you had these fine clothes

00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:55.275
still being made by--put
together by single women or

00:15:55.275 --> 00:15:58.087
single men,
I don't know if they're married

00:15:58.087 --> 00:16:00.492
or not, but working by
themselves at home,

00:16:00.492 --> 00:16:03.600
that are part of the artisanal
structure of Paris;

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.530
where, if you went into the
hinterland of Paris or into the

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.409
industrial suburbs there you
have the dirty industries,

00:16:09.409 --> 00:16:11.432
soap production,
chemical production,

00:16:11.432 --> 00:16:14.802
that people don't want in the
city and the city values are so

00:16:14.802 --> 00:16:17.780
high that if you want space
you're going to build them

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.870
outside--more about that when I
talk about Paris.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:25.402
And, then you have Lyon,
and Lyon was the soap workers'

00:16:25.402 --> 00:16:30.269
capital of--really of the world,
in terms of production.

00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:33.540
And if you want to find one--if
you're going to go to one city

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.899
and see where every layer of
architecture,

00:16:35.899 --> 00:16:39.538
every layer of architecture
representing the past is there,

00:16:39.538 --> 00:16:42.584
Lyon is the place to go,
because there you've got

00:16:42.584 --> 00:16:45.472
Gallo-Roman ruins,
you've got medieval--a fabulous

00:16:45.472 --> 00:16:48.831
medieval neighborhood on the
right bank of the Sâone

00:16:48.831 --> 00:16:51.679
River,
you have renaissance quarters

00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:54.565
that are fabulous.
You have the best

00:16:54.565 --> 00:16:59.754
seventeenth-century apartment
buildings that are left anywhere

00:16:59.754 --> 00:17:01.475
in France,
you have this

00:17:01.475 --> 00:17:04.081
eighteenth-century sort of
classic, the Place Bellecour,

00:17:04.081 --> 00:17:06.829
and you have this nineteenth
century industrial suburb,

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:09.278
right on the hill,
called the Croix-Rousse,

00:17:09.278 --> 00:17:12.543
where all the--literally all
the buildings have real tall

00:17:12.543 --> 00:17:15.750
roofs in order to accommodate
these big silk looms,

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.004
which are called
jacquards,

00:17:17.004 --> 00:17:18.829
but you obviously don't have to
remember that.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:21.858
The point is that this becomes
a big industrial center,

00:17:21.858 --> 00:17:24.998
and that even as late as the
1860s you still had merchant

00:17:24.998 --> 00:17:28.139
capitalists putting work back
out into the countryside in

00:17:28.139 --> 00:17:32.210
order to take advantage of what?
Of cheap female labor.

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:36.306
Women make one half of what men
do in any trade in Europe,

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:39.180
any occupation,
throughout the nineteenth

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.630
century and well into the
twentieth century.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.769
You have other artisanal kind
of producing towns.

00:17:44.769 --> 00:17:47.369
You have-- Toulouse is a big
artisanal center;

00:17:47.369 --> 00:17:50.091
Marseilles produces soap,
I could go through the whole

00:17:50.091 --> 00:17:51.940
map, but I'm not going to do
that.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.688
You have old textile towns that
are still producing and turning

00:17:54.688 --> 00:17:57.777
out lots of things,
like Rouen, which is one of my

00:17:57.777 --> 00:18:01.659
favorite towns in Normandie,
where I teach every year a

00:18:01.659 --> 00:18:04.320
course that we jam into two
weeks;

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.214
and Troyes and places like that.
So but these places are rather

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:10.880
spread apart.
You've got your basic

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.384
shipbuilding,
places like Saint-Nazaire,

00:18:12.384 --> 00:18:16.043
et cetera, et cetera.
So, though not gifted by having

00:18:16.043 --> 00:18:21.334
primary resources near major
waterways, with the exception of

00:18:21.334 --> 00:18:24.780
the Loire River,
you still have this

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.953
transformation of the economy.
But there was industrial

00:18:28.953 --> 00:18:32.109
production of some kind almost
anywhere that you could go.

00:18:32.109 --> 00:18:35.318
And, then, you have very
specialized cases like Limoges

00:18:35.318 --> 00:18:38.585
which is famous for its
porcelain, maybe more about that

00:18:38.585 --> 00:18:40.249
later.
Why is it famous for its

00:18:40.249 --> 00:18:42.504
porcelain?
Because there's a clay that you

00:18:42.504 --> 00:18:44.894
make porcelain out of called
kaolin,

00:18:44.894 --> 00:18:47.910
which was a Chinese term,
that is available there.

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.932
And, so, that's why Havilland
porcelain, which no longer

00:18:50.932 --> 00:18:53.460
exists, incredibly
enough--Havilland,

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.041
it was American,
I said that before--but it

00:18:56.041 --> 00:18:58.807
doesn't exist,
they're closing their doors and

00:18:58.807 --> 00:19:01.450
there's one really major
producer left.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:05.629
But, these were part of the
Industrial Revolution in La

00:19:05.629 --> 00:19:08.537
Belle France.
And, because it has now been

00:19:08.537 --> 00:19:11.970
annexed by Germany--that is,
not now but in the 1870s,

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:15.559
I mean in 1871--I didn't talk
about all the textile production

00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:19.089
in Alsace, but there was lots of
textile production there.

00:19:19.089 --> 00:19:22.208
And, as everywhere it's the
textile production that is the

00:19:22.208 --> 00:19:24.177
cutting edge,
the leading edge of the

00:19:24.177 --> 00:19:27.566
Industrial Revolution,
followed by metallurgical

00:19:27.566 --> 00:19:30.651
production.
And, as in the case of Britain,

00:19:30.651 --> 00:19:34.243
that is, the trains help
encourage investment because

00:19:34.243 --> 00:19:37.144
people can see trains,
they can ride trains,

00:19:37.144 --> 00:19:40.499
and they look like something
that's going to lead France into

00:19:40.499 --> 00:19:42.464
this new,
brand new industrial world,

00:19:42.464 --> 00:19:45.197
and so that helps accentuate
the number of people who have

00:19:45.197 --> 00:19:49.150
something to invest,
investing in railroads.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:52.901
As a matter of fact,
one of the things that probably

00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:57.314
hurts French industry during
exactly the period we're talking

00:19:57.314 --> 00:19:59.362
about,
that is the 1870s,

00:19:59.362 --> 00:20:02.862
'80s and the early 1890s,
is the fact that French

00:20:02.862 --> 00:20:06.069
capitalists begin investing in
railroads,

00:20:06.069 --> 00:20:09.529
but in other places,
in Italy, in Russia,

00:20:09.529 --> 00:20:13.074
and in Spain,
where the railroads are to a

00:20:13.074 --> 00:20:16.619
great extent built by French
capital.

00:20:16.619 --> 00:20:19.282
So then you've got people who
are from--English economists

00:20:19.282 --> 00:20:21.859
saying, "oh well,
they'll never catch up with us

00:20:21.859 --> 00:20:25.237
because the peasants all hide
their money under their beds or

00:20:25.237 --> 00:20:29.294
bury them in the gardens,"
or people that have capital to

00:20:29.294 --> 00:20:33.900
invest are investing the money
in these other railroads.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:41.210
Now, what about women in all of
this?

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:44.407
The role of women in the
Industrial Revolution is

00:20:44.407 --> 00:20:47.776
obviously crucial.
In the case of France and in

00:20:47.776 --> 00:20:50.613
the case of Sheffield,
around Sheffield,

00:20:50.613 --> 00:20:55.038
or Birmingham in England,
the role of women in domestic

00:20:55.038 --> 00:20:59.733
industry or finishing products
was extremely important and

00:20:59.733 --> 00:21:03.973
extremely persistent.
The Industrial Revolution,

00:21:03.973 --> 00:21:08.935
even the second Industrial
Revolution, does not--the story

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:13.897
has more continuities than
dramatic changes in the role of

00:21:13.897 --> 00:21:17.380
women in the Industrial
Revolution.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.538
Women had always worked in
textile production,

00:21:20.538 --> 00:21:24.400
but they'd worked by themselves
in the Vendée,

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.970
or anywhere and in Lorraine or
almost anywhere,

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.900
back for centuries.
And they still do.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:35.846
We've exaggerated the
separation of work and home in

00:21:35.846 --> 00:21:40.599
the role of women in the
Industrial Revolution,

00:21:40.599 --> 00:21:43.674
because if you look at Paris in
the 1890s--I have a former

00:21:43.674 --> 00:21:45.294
graduate student,
Judy Coffin,

00:21:45.294 --> 00:21:48.316
who has a wonderful book on the
sewing machine and its role in

00:21:48.316 --> 00:21:50.744
all of this.
If you look at industrial

00:21:50.744 --> 00:21:54.384
production of these fine
garments and handbags that are

00:21:54.384 --> 00:21:57.007
made in Paris,
many of them in the garment

00:21:57.007 --> 00:22:00.345
industry, the Garment District
of Paris, which is right in the

00:22:00.345 --> 00:22:02.369
center of Paris on the right
bank,

00:22:02.369 --> 00:22:06.095
around a street called Sentier,
are done by single women

00:22:06.095 --> 00:22:09.279
working on the very top floors
by themselves,

00:22:09.279 --> 00:22:13.551
and working for a merchant
capitalist, just as their

00:22:13.551 --> 00:22:17.740
predecessors had done two
centuries before that.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.519
And, so, those continuities are
still very important.

00:22:20.519 --> 00:22:23.376
But to be sure,
in the more sort of classic,

00:22:23.376 --> 00:22:25.900
or the usual kind of thing you
hear,

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.169
I'll make in awhile,
to be sure they gradually move

00:22:29.169 --> 00:22:32.226
into factory production.
But, what does not change

00:22:32.226 --> 00:22:35.535
is--another thing that does not
change is the role of women in

00:22:35.535 --> 00:22:37.759
the managing of the household
economy,

00:22:37.759 --> 00:22:41.939
because women have to somehow
piece together enough work,

00:22:41.939 --> 00:22:46.118
enough income from their
children and from their husbands

00:22:46.118 --> 00:22:49.849
or partners in order to keep the
family going,

00:22:49.849 --> 00:22:56.289
and women's role in the
household economy is still

00:22:56.289 --> 00:23:01.870
extraordinarily important.
Also, some aspects of women and

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.630
work that is not industrial does
not change.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:09.665
In England--in Great Britain,
but let's say England,

00:23:09.665 --> 00:23:14.618
in 1850 and again in 1880,
the largest two female

00:23:14.618 --> 00:23:19.890
occupations are textile
operatives, factory workers,

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.844
and domestics,
and in France that's the same

00:23:22.844 --> 00:23:25.251
case too.
And one of the things that

00:23:25.251 --> 00:23:28.047
single women do who come into
Paris, or Lyon,

00:23:28.047 --> 00:23:31.238
or Strasbourg or whatever,
to try to get a job,

00:23:31.238 --> 00:23:34.339
is they place themselves in
domestic service.

00:23:34.339 --> 00:23:36.402
And, of course,
their conditions of work are

00:23:36.402 --> 00:23:38.559
lamentable, and there's all
the--and often,

00:23:38.559 --> 00:23:42.661
often--and there's a whole
range of literature about what

00:23:42.661 --> 00:23:45.098
happens to them.
And, of course,

00:23:45.098 --> 00:23:49.499
some of the most spectacular
cases of things going wrong are

00:23:49.499 --> 00:23:53.974
the ones that you hear about
from social commentators at that

00:23:53.974 --> 00:23:56.983
time,
which is the single domestic

00:23:56.983 --> 00:24:01.349
service gets impregnated by the
aggressive older son,

00:24:01.349 --> 00:24:04.410
or younger son of the boss,
and then, the minute she's

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:08.196
pregnant she is out of there,
and then that is a fairly quick

00:24:08.196 --> 00:24:11.223
road, in many cases,
of many rural people to--if

00:24:11.223 --> 00:24:14.380
you're pregnant you're not going
to get hired,

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.848
who's going to hire you?
So, then what happens to the

00:24:17.848 --> 00:24:19.920
baby, in France,
anywhere?

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:25.089
Infanticide or abandonment,
in the foundling homes.

00:24:25.089 --> 00:24:28.085
And what they did--and,
so, in order to cut down the

00:24:28.085 --> 00:24:31.373
infanticide rate they create
this thing--and it still was

00:24:31.373 --> 00:24:35.015
debated again about three months
ago in Rome--they create these

00:24:35.015 --> 00:24:38.950
things called tours--I
don't what you'd--tours,

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:41.225
they're tours,
these things that turn,

00:24:41.225 --> 00:24:44.223
and they're like the machines
that they used to have in the

00:24:44.223 --> 00:24:46.981
ill-fated machine city,
which some of you don't

00:24:46.981 --> 00:24:49.526
remember, where you'd put in
your money and,

00:24:49.526 --> 00:24:52.194
if you get lucky,
the product will actually come

00:24:52.194 --> 00:24:54.421
back toward you,
and what happens there is you

00:24:54.421 --> 00:24:57.341
ring the little bell and this
little thing turns and you put

00:24:57.341 --> 00:25:00.518
the baby in there,
and then some nice person keeps

00:25:00.518 --> 00:25:04.464
the baby, because otherwise you
just abandon the baby and the

00:25:04.464 --> 00:25:06.733
baby dies.
And the number of infanticides

00:25:06.733 --> 00:25:08.972
every day was tragic.
And once you got into it,

00:25:08.972 --> 00:25:11.713
if you were a baby and you get
into one of these foundling

00:25:11.713 --> 00:25:14.069
homes, your chances of survival
are very thin.

00:25:14.069 --> 00:25:17.857
And every large foundling home
really into the--through the

00:25:17.857 --> 00:25:21.580
1870s the number of people--of
babies who die is one-third

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.403
every year.
So, that's another reason,

00:25:24.403 --> 00:25:28.303
by the way, why French cities,
more people die in French

00:25:28.303 --> 00:25:31.210
cities than are born in French
cities,

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:34.925
through much of the century,
because of the huge rates of

00:25:34.925 --> 00:25:37.380
child abandonment and
infanticides.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:41.150
So it's a most unfortunate
scene.

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:45.732
And then what happens after x,
this mother x has her baby,

00:25:45.732 --> 00:25:50.988
abandons her baby,
and sadly, maybe in ten percent

00:25:50.988 --> 00:25:54.283
of the cases,
kills her baby,

00:25:54.283 --> 00:26:00.050
is that the road to
prostitution is a rather quick

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:02.599
one,
coming along;

00:26:02.599 --> 00:26:04.609
or try to get back into
domestic service.

00:26:04.609 --> 00:26:07.963
So, but, for most women things
go better than that,

00:26:07.963 --> 00:26:11.853
but they never go splendidly
because they're never going to

00:26:11.853 --> 00:26:16.463
earn what males earn,
and they're the last hired and

00:26:16.463 --> 00:26:20.772
the first fired right along.
And, then you had this other

00:26:20.772 --> 00:26:23.139
thing that happens,
is that the Socialists are

00:26:23.139 --> 00:26:25.980
quite concerned with what
happens to women's wages,

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.260
and the unions are quite
concerned what happens to

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.308
women's wages,
but they're not very concerned

00:26:30.308 --> 00:26:32.450
about whether they have the
right to vote.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:35.059
Why?
Because the socialists are

00:26:35.059 --> 00:26:37.225
afraid that because women,
as I said before,

00:26:37.225 --> 00:26:39.289
are more apt to go to church
than men,

00:26:39.289 --> 00:26:42.534
by far, then and now,
that they will vote the way the

00:26:42.534 --> 00:26:45.029
priest tells them in the
confessional.

00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:49.146
So, the socialists do not
support the right of women to

00:26:49.146 --> 00:26:51.106
vote.
And women don't vote in France,

00:26:51.106 --> 00:26:53.500
they don't get the right to
vote after World War I,

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.250
despite all the
sacrifices--they get the right

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:59.977
to vote in Britain--they don't
get the right to vote in France

00:26:59.977 --> 00:27:05.970
until after World War II.
So, again, so what changes?

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:09.659
So, keep your eye on the big
picture, is that domestic

00:27:09.659 --> 00:27:13.000
industry gradually implodes into
these cities,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.773
into factories,
on the edge of French cities,

00:27:16.773 --> 00:27:20.546
big and small,
but that what women do doesn't

00:27:20.546 --> 00:27:23.092
change,
they're still doing domestic

00:27:23.092 --> 00:27:26.354
industry, they're still doing--I
mean, they're still doing

00:27:26.354 --> 00:27:28.281
textile work,
they're not doing domestic

00:27:28.281 --> 00:27:29.351
industry;
take that back,

00:27:29.351 --> 00:27:32.765
I take that back.
They are doing textile industry

00:27:32.765 --> 00:27:37.453
work, but increasingly in
factories, which is the classic

00:27:37.453 --> 00:27:40.970
portrayal of the Industrial
Revolution.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:43.618
And, so, the classic portrayal
ends up being right,

00:27:43.618 --> 00:27:46.744
but only rather gradually in
France, over a very long period

00:27:46.744 --> 00:27:48.461
of time.
Or take Catherine,

00:27:48.461 --> 00:27:51.346
one of the more engaging
figures in modern French

00:27:51.346 --> 00:27:53.750
literature, I think it's fair to
say.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.769
Her experience is perfectly
normal.

00:27:55.769 --> 00:27:59.940
It's sad, it's pathetic,
but it's very normal.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.091
I'll give you an example.
This is--we live about two and

00:28:03.091 --> 00:28:04.677
a half hours from
Saint-Étienne,

00:28:04.677 --> 00:28:06.680
and I hardly ever go to
Saint-Étienne,

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.951
I go there to work once in
awhile, in the archives,

00:28:08.951 --> 00:28:10.814
but not that often,
nor do I follow Les

00:28:10.814 --> 00:28:14.068
Verts,
which is their famous soccer

00:28:14.068 --> 00:28:16.312
team.
But there's still an expression

00:28:16.312 --> 00:28:18.759
that people use there.
If a child screws up,

00:28:18.759 --> 00:28:21.729
does something--you're nine,
eight or nine years old,

00:28:21.729 --> 00:28:24.700
and do something your parents
tell you not to do,

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.825
and you do it anyway,
they'll say something like,

00:28:27.825 --> 00:28:30.299
deux semaines sous une
benne,

00:28:30.299 --> 00:28:35.295
two weeks under---a
benne is a kind of a

00:28:35.295 --> 00:28:40.203
wagon that's used to haul coal,
and what children did in

00:28:40.203 --> 00:28:43.124
factories, and in mines,
is--because they're small you

00:28:43.124 --> 00:28:45.440
can put them under one of these
wagons,

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.010
and they help move it along the
tracks--that'd be a lot of fun

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:49.640
wouldn't it?
Because they have little

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:53.978
shoulders, but strong shoulders.
Or fixing machines in factories

00:28:53.978 --> 00:28:59.140
with their little fingers which
would get chopped off.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.750
"They're so careless," said a
British manufacturer when a

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:04.359
couple of them kept getting
their fingers chopped off.

00:29:04.359 --> 00:29:07.359
And, so, a way of correcting a
child would be to say,

00:29:07.359 --> 00:29:10.763
"two weeks pushing that thing
around and you won't screw up,

00:29:10.763 --> 00:29:12.839
you'll do what I tell you to
do.

00:29:12.839 --> 00:29:16.342
You won't skip school,
you'll go to school," and this

00:29:16.342 --> 00:29:18.654
sort of thing.
So, these expressions still

00:29:18.654 --> 00:29:20.194
linger.
So, child labor too,

00:29:20.194 --> 00:29:23.717
again there is opposition to
schooling from families who need

00:29:23.717 --> 00:29:27.736
that extra income,
or that extra labor of children

00:29:27.736 --> 00:29:31.692
in the farmyard,
or watching the sheep in the

00:29:31.692 --> 00:29:35.207
transhumance,
moving the sheep into the

00:29:35.207 --> 00:29:39.848
mountain and all that.
So, again these continuities

00:29:39.848 --> 00:29:44.220
and changes are extremely
important.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.840
Now, I didn't,
and I don't think I have time

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.339
to do this now but I'll do it
sometime,

00:29:49.339 --> 00:29:52.746
talk about the decline of the
French population,

00:29:52.746 --> 00:29:55.789
why France simply stops having
children.

00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:57.673
I've talked a little bit about
that but I have to come back and

00:29:57.673 --> 00:29:59.428
do that again.
I think I'll wait till we're

00:29:59.428 --> 00:30:02.145
talking about the origins of
World War I, because that's when

00:30:02.145 --> 00:30:05.000
it really frightened people,
because it didn't look like

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.008
there'd be enough French to
survive, to maybe fight a war

00:30:08.008 --> 00:30:10.480
against all those rapidly
breeding Germans,

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.960
and things weren't working
there.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.775
So, what I want to talk to you
about now is how workers viewed

00:30:16.775 --> 00:30:21.299
what was happening to them.
And, so, there's really oh kind

00:30:21.299 --> 00:30:25.424
of three things I want to say.
The first is quick,

00:30:25.424 --> 00:30:29.815
is that proletarianization is
both--and this was a word that

00:30:29.815 --> 00:30:33.462
people used--is both an
objective and a subjective

00:30:33.462 --> 00:30:36.959
concept.
And the third is to talk about

00:30:36.959 --> 00:30:41.680
how workers viewed the factory
and viewed their bosses,

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.556
because the period,
particularly 1895 to 1907 has

00:30:45.556 --> 00:30:49.109
been called the heroic age of
syndicalism,

00:30:49.109 --> 00:30:54.210
or union organization,
and strikes in France.

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:58.649
Now, proletarianization.
We live in a country in which

00:30:58.649 --> 00:31:03.324
part of the canon has always
been that in America if you work

00:31:03.324 --> 00:31:06.829
hard you'll always be rewarded
at the end,

00:31:06.829 --> 00:31:12.589
and that the descriptions of
the late nineteenth century is

00:31:12.589 --> 00:31:16.082
people working very hard,
and doing very well,

00:31:16.082 --> 00:31:18.274
and moving into the middle and
indeed upper classes and

00:31:18.274 --> 00:31:21.024
becoming very wealthy.
Obviously, that's not the case,

00:31:21.024 --> 00:31:24.044
that the great exceptions were
the one that people paid

00:31:24.044 --> 00:31:26.791
attention to.
There is social mobility in

00:31:26.791 --> 00:31:29.022
France.
There used to be all sorts of

00:31:29.022 --> 00:31:32.329
studies-- that's what people
did, not me--but in the 1970s

00:31:32.329 --> 00:31:36.636
about social mobility.
Social mobility was extremely

00:31:36.636 --> 00:31:42.250
limited for people who were born
into the working class.

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:47.267
And in 1968,1968,
the riots, la revolution

00:31:47.267 --> 00:31:53.425
manquée--in 1968,
one of the big issues that

00:31:53.425 --> 00:31:58.556
students your age had,
and professors my age had,

00:31:58.556 --> 00:32:02.640
though I was your age then,
or a little younger,

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.521
I guess, was that you could
work your ass off and your

00:32:06.521 --> 00:32:10.402
chances of getting into a
university weren't very good

00:32:10.402 --> 00:32:14.942
because once you were born into
the lower classes--schools were

00:32:14.942 --> 00:32:18.201
schools of elites,
that's what they were--and once

00:32:18.201 --> 00:32:20.768
you got through there,
there was no guarantee you were

00:32:20.768 --> 00:32:23.859
going to get a job anywhere,
and people were extremely mad

00:32:23.859 --> 00:32:26.710
and upset, and they viewed--they
blamed capitalism,

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:30.766
they blamed the State,
as their predecessors had in

00:32:30.766 --> 00:32:34.618
the 1890s.
And, so, people who were born

00:32:34.618 --> 00:32:38.093
into a life of work,
a life of hard,

00:32:38.093 --> 00:32:41.750
difficult work,
that was one--you ended--you

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:44.690
were born into the jobs that you
would get.

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:47.605
And if--I'll give you another
Saint-Étienne example

00:32:47.605 --> 00:32:50.116
because that's so important,
Saint-Étienne,

00:32:50.116 --> 00:32:52.068
that there were lots of people
who moved to

00:32:52.068 --> 00:32:54.903
Saint-Étienne--don't have
to remember this--come from a

00:32:54.903 --> 00:32:57.599
very religious part of France
called the Haute-Loire,

00:32:57.599 --> 00:33:00.705
which the capital is Le Puy,
and a lot of these people

00:33:00.705 --> 00:33:04.280
emptying out that department
moved to Saint-Étienne.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.738
And they don't move.
Some of them become teachers,

00:33:06.738 --> 00:33:08.779
some of them are going to get
clerks jobs, if they're

00:33:08.779 --> 00:33:11.406
educated.
But they don't do very well and

00:33:11.406 --> 00:33:15.579
they live--there are periods
where they're doing all right,

00:33:15.579 --> 00:33:17.915
and then they're let go,
and then they're doing all

00:33:17.915 --> 00:33:21.210
right and then they're let go,
and it's just--the more you

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:25.143
read about the 1880s and '90s
and sort of memoirs of working

00:33:25.143 --> 00:33:27.671
people,
was just the difficulty of

00:33:27.671 --> 00:33:31.250
making things work from day to
day, week to week,

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:35.069
month to month, just getting by.
And they learned to hate.

00:33:35.069 --> 00:33:38.351
I'm writing a book about a guy
whom I'll tell you about some

00:33:38.351 --> 00:33:41.410
day, who really--he said that
love can make you hate.

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:44.571
And he viewed all of this,
and then he set out to destroy

00:33:44.571 --> 00:33:47.789
the state that he thought had
made capitalism possible;

00:33:47.789 --> 00:33:50.160
but, that's another story for
another day.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:54.150
So, there's this objective
status of being--you're a

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:57.901
worker, that's what you do,
and you're proud of it,

00:33:57.901 --> 00:34:01.510
and you wore blue as a color,
you wore your blue frock or

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:03.531
smock,
whatever you call it,

00:34:03.531 --> 00:34:06.277
and you spoke a language in
argot,

00:34:06.277 --> 00:34:09.710
read--if you read
L'Assommoir in French,

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:12.480
it's a language that's
extremely difficult to read

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.420
because a lot of the expressions
have disappeared,

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.780
but it's a way of protecting
your identity.

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.753
It's like the way people talked
in the suburbs,

00:34:20.753 --> 00:34:24.179
particularly in the 1980s,
1990s, en verlan.

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:26.641
It's a kind of language,
kind of a slang,

00:34:26.641 --> 00:34:29.349
of an argot that helps protect
your identity,

00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:31.750
that you're proud of your
identity.

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:35.480
And they were proud of being
workers, as well they should.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:40.207
But the subjective aspect is
what people studied in the 1960s

00:34:40.207 --> 00:34:43.989
and '70s, and the term is
class-consciousness.

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:46.130
And, certainly,
there was an attempt to prove

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:49.000
that all workers all over the
place were class conscious.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.786
But that wasn't the case.
People have other identities,

00:34:51.786 --> 00:34:54.317
collective identities.
You could have multiple

00:34:54.317 --> 00:34:56.709
identities-- family,
religion, region,

00:34:56.709 --> 00:34:59.490
we've talked about this,
village, et cetera,

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:02.493
et cetera.
But the fact remains that one

00:35:02.493 --> 00:35:06.280
of the reasons why there's so
many strikes in France,

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:10.446
as in other countries too,
it has to do on the one hand

00:35:10.446 --> 00:35:13.918
with unionization,
and the sympathetic role of

00:35:13.918 --> 00:35:17.544
leftwing politicians in
supporting working class

00:35:17.544 --> 00:35:20.888
organization,
but it has--it also has much to

00:35:20.888 --> 00:35:24.585
do with people coming to a sense
that they are workers and are

00:35:24.585 --> 00:35:28.040
conscious of themselves as a
class and they view the State

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:31.980
and the wealthy people as being
contrary to their interests.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:35.750
Now, this starts in
France--starts earlier among

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:39.360
artisans in Britain,
arguably in the 1790s,

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:45.023
in France it really starts in
the 1830s, and the word

00:35:45.023 --> 00:35:50.360
socialism is first used by a
socialist in 1834,

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:54.248
a guy called Pierre Leroux who
was a utopian socialist--forget

00:35:54.248 --> 00:35:56.480
him, but he's an interesting
guy.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.895
But it's at this point where
artisans, not ordinary workers,

00:36:00.895 --> 00:36:03.440
see themselves as a class
apart.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.351
So, at the beginning they don't
want to have anything to do with

00:36:06.351 --> 00:36:08.755
these unskilled workers,
that they may work with in a

00:36:08.755 --> 00:36:10.751
factory.
But they're dressed nicely,

00:36:10.751 --> 00:36:13.368
they wore corduroy suits,
and these other workers,

00:36:13.368 --> 00:36:16.224
they don't dress like that;
and they're educated,

00:36:16.224 --> 00:36:19.571
that's why artisans are at the
forefront, they create the

00:36:19.571 --> 00:36:22.260
strike really,
in the early modern period.

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.090
It's artisans,
it's skilled craftsmen.

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:27.180
And just in two minutes,
why does this happen,

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:31.163
why do artisans suddenly start
seeing themselves as a class

00:36:31.163 --> 00:36:34.136
apart?
Why do they start targeting

00:36:34.136 --> 00:36:38.539
capitalism as a structure and
the State as doing them

00:36:38.539 --> 00:36:40.889
injustice.
Why?

00:36:40.889 --> 00:36:43.690
Well, there are really two
reasons that one can give.

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:46.449
One is that what happens
because of the French

00:36:46.449 --> 00:36:48.780
Revolution, to craftsmen in
Germany,

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:52.841
in parts of Italy and in
France, is that it opens the

00:36:52.841 --> 00:36:56.199
doors and the guild protections
are gone.

00:36:56.199 --> 00:36:59.269
Anybody can be any trade you
want.

00:36:59.269 --> 00:37:01.913
Laissez-faire capitalism,
you want to be a plumber,

00:37:01.913 --> 00:37:04.644
you can be a plumber;
you want to be a tailor,

00:37:04.644 --> 00:37:07.534
you can be a tailor.
And, so, all of a sudden in

00:37:07.534 --> 00:37:10.431
Paris in the 1830s,
'40s and '50s there's all sorts

00:37:10.431 --> 00:37:14.023
of wagons being pushed through
the street with beautifully made

00:37:14.023 --> 00:37:16.743
clothes on them,
going for practically nothing,

00:37:16.743 --> 00:37:19.349
because there's so many other
tailors making suits,

00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:21.895
and the price,
the wages these guys get--Marx

00:37:21.895 --> 00:37:23.920
was right about,
only about that,

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.064
insofar as his assessment of
wages--artisans are making less

00:37:27.064 --> 00:37:29.090
money, their world is falling
apart.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:30.739
They have the dignity,
they have the skill,

00:37:30.739 --> 00:37:32.860
they have the knowledge,
they have the organization,

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.915
in friendly societies,
which at a minimum give you a

00:37:35.915 --> 00:37:39.630
decent burial so you're not
dumped into some pauper's grave,

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:43.545
and they're mad because who let
all these other people do the

00:37:43.545 --> 00:37:46.090
trades that the guilds had
protected?

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:49.059
And the other thing that
happens is--goes back to where

00:37:49.059 --> 00:37:52.250
we started--industrialization
and mechanized production,

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:56.042
that if you go to a market in
Reims, since I used that example

00:37:56.042 --> 00:37:59.027
before, or anywhere you want,
in Aubigne or Privas,

00:37:59.027 --> 00:38:00.690
and in n'importe
où,

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:03.409
you can go there and you can
buy a suit off a rack,

00:38:03.409 --> 00:38:07.445
you can just go and buy a suit,
and you don't have to pay

00:38:07.445 --> 00:38:11.913
somebody a lot of money to make
your suit from beginning to the

00:38:11.913 --> 00:38:14.260
end,
because it's cheaper.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.798
So, who does that hurt?
It hurts the artisans,

00:38:16.798 --> 00:38:19.039
the craftsmen.
And, so, what happens then?

00:38:19.039 --> 00:38:22.467
"Ah-ha," somebody with money
says, "hey, you guys are all

00:38:22.467 --> 00:38:25.160
tailors, you're not doing so
well are you?

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.007
Things aren't real good.
Well, I'll tell you what,

00:38:28.007 --> 00:38:31.817
I'll tell you what.
I will pay you to make pants

00:38:31.817 --> 00:38:33.807
cuffs."
I don't know much about suits,

00:38:33.807 --> 00:38:36.925
as you'll probably gather.
"I will tell you to make pants

00:38:36.925 --> 00:38:40.420
cuffs"--do you make pants cuffs?
I guess you have to.

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.743
Or to make sleeves on a jacket,
"and all I want you to do is

00:38:43.743 --> 00:38:45.940
make one-hundred sleeves on a
jacket.

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.240
You make the left ones,
you make the right ones,

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.858
and I'll pay you."
It's just like domestic

00:38:50.858 --> 00:38:53.520
industry, before.
Are they mad?

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.616
Of course, they're furious.
And they go out on strike but

00:38:56.616 --> 00:38:59.858
they always lose.
And you can strike in France

00:38:59.858 --> 00:39:02.920
after 1864.
So, that's what happens to them.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.779
Or, let me give you another
example from good old Limoges,

00:39:06.779 --> 00:39:09.596
in Limoges.
Plates, you got plates,

00:39:09.596 --> 00:39:13.973
and plates had always
been--beautiful plates had been

00:39:13.973 --> 00:39:17.074
hand painted.
Renoir, the painter,

00:39:17.074 --> 00:39:22.250
he started life as a porcelain
painter, and then--and that's

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:26.648
what made it a quality item.
If you find painted Limoges

00:39:26.648 --> 00:39:29.695
plates from the 1880s,
you hang onto those babies,

00:39:29.695 --> 00:39:32.120
and don't put them in the
microwave.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:36.682
So, then what happens?
So, somebody invents a process

00:39:36.682 --> 00:39:40.170
where you can put,
like a decal on a child's toy,

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:43.758
onto the plate and bake the
decal onto the plate between the

00:39:43.758 --> 00:39:46.530
first and second baking.
So, what happens to these

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:49.053
people who are very talented,
who made all this money,

00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:51.766
and didn't hang around with
these other guys who make less

00:39:51.766 --> 00:39:53.856
money?
They are screwed,

00:39:53.856 --> 00:39:57.639
no one's going to hire them.
They'll keep one or two.

00:39:57.639 --> 00:40:00.580
I once saw a special order that
had been done for the Shah of

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:03.226
Iran--this was a long time
ago--hand painted because he

00:40:03.226 --> 00:40:05.800
wanted it hand painted.
But, that's the end of that.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.090
And they ended up in the
warehouse, or ended up doing

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:09.925
whatever they could.
Or glass workers,

00:40:09.925 --> 00:40:12.472
the same thing.
The people that made bottles,

00:40:12.472 --> 00:40:16.175
were very skilled and they were
called messieur l'ouvrier en

00:40:16.175 --> 00:40:18.444
bouteille,
they were called "mister

00:40:18.444 --> 00:40:20.852
glassworker."
And suddenly somebody in the

00:40:20.852 --> 00:40:23.469
United States invents a machine
that can make glasses,

00:40:23.469 --> 00:40:27.254
bottles, turn out thousands of
them, to be filled with wine and

00:40:27.254 --> 00:40:30.050
other things.
Who needs these guys anymore?

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:31.786
And they go on the road to
Belgium or anywhere they

00:40:31.786 --> 00:40:34.010
can--nobody needs them anymore,
a machine has eliminated them.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:36.065
Are they mad?
Oh, and shoemakers,

00:40:36.065 --> 00:40:38.169
the same thing,
these machines made in St.

00:40:38.169 --> 00:40:40.428
Louis, Missouri,
I think, come along and wipe

00:40:40.428 --> 00:40:42.429
out certain aspects of
shoemaking.

00:40:42.429 --> 00:40:46.107
So, this leads people to think
there is something that we can't

00:40:46.107 --> 00:40:49.310
control out there that is
affecting our lives in a very

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:52.642
ruinous way.
So, these people are at the

00:40:52.642 --> 00:40:57.025
forefront of labor militancy.
And in the course of the 1880s

00:40:57.025 --> 00:41:00.265
and 1890s they start thinking
about, "hey, you know those

00:41:00.265 --> 00:41:04.675
people that we don't drink with,
the ones who load things,

00:41:04.675 --> 00:41:08.206
carry things around,
ordinary workers,

00:41:08.206 --> 00:41:11.015
maybe, you know,
maybe they got the same,

00:41:11.015 --> 00:41:14.244
maybe the same enemy."
And, then they start supporting

00:41:14.244 --> 00:41:18.646
their hesitant organizational
movements, and strikes and they

00:41:18.646 --> 00:41:23.414
get together.
Now, how did this look from the

00:41:23.414 --> 00:41:28.128
point of view of workers?
How do they view what was

00:41:28.128 --> 00:41:31.243
happening to them?
Again, we can romanticize

00:41:31.243 --> 00:41:34.963
class-consciousness,
we can romanticize this idea of

00:41:34.963 --> 00:41:39.164
a moral economy,
that people ought to be paid a

00:41:39.164 --> 00:41:44.931
good wage for a good day's work.
And it didn't happen all over

00:41:44.931 --> 00:41:50.550
the place, but still it's rather
impressive, and depressing;

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:54.587
impressive the organization,
and depressing the view of

00:41:54.587 --> 00:41:58.924
capitalism and the factory as
these units of production get

00:41:58.924 --> 00:42:02.119
larger and larger.
Let me give you two examples

00:42:02.119 --> 00:42:05.641
how this looked.
One, during strikes what was

00:42:05.641 --> 00:42:09.514
the image that workers had of
their bosses,

00:42:09.514 --> 00:42:13.840
and what does this tell us?
And my friend and cherished

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:17.250
colleague, one of the greatest
historians I've ever known,

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:20.434
one of the great people I've
ever know, Michelle Perrot,

00:42:20.434 --> 00:42:23.561
in France, did work on this
among other of her genius's

00:42:23.561 --> 00:42:27.360
works,
the view of the other.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:31.073
In the 1820s and 1830s,
when artisans went on strike,

00:42:31.073 --> 00:42:33.429
they knew the boss,
the master.

00:42:33.429 --> 00:42:36.442
The boss was somebody who
they'd see and all that,

00:42:36.442 --> 00:42:40.070
and they'd see him around but
they're kind of mad at him,

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:42.397
so we're going to withdraw our
labor for awhile,

00:42:42.397 --> 00:42:44.130
we don't--you got to pay us
more,

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:47.427
you ought to be the guy you can
be, you ought to be the guy you

00:42:47.427 --> 00:42:50.855
can be and pay us a just wage.
Well, the master,

00:42:50.855 --> 00:42:56.947
he has pretty good relations
with them, he may like the noble

00:42:56.947 --> 00:43:00.061
in Toulouse,
he may--or around Toulouse--he

00:43:00.061 --> 00:43:03.190
may give them a chicken on
Easter, or something like that.

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:06.939
But he's somebody recognizable,
and he's paternalistic but this

00:43:06.939 --> 00:43:09.462
time he's gone wrong.
So, we're going to go out on

00:43:09.462 --> 00:43:11.040
him, we'll blacklist him and all
that.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:15.126
What about the 1850s and 1860s?
Why, that is very different

00:43:15.126 --> 00:43:16.836
indeed.
The 1850s and 1860s,

00:43:16.836 --> 00:43:19.901
if you look at the vocabulary
of the people on strike,

00:43:19.901 --> 00:43:23.195
that they still know the boss,
they say to the boss,

00:43:23.195 --> 00:43:26.958
but they call him a letch,
he's a letch because he hits on

00:43:26.958 --> 00:43:30.309
his female workers,
often with some success.

00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:35.254
He's gross, or he eats too
much, or he drinks too much,

00:43:35.254 --> 00:43:38.521
or he beats his wife.
They're personal

00:43:38.521 --> 00:43:42.296
characteristics in the kind of
language, the gesture,

00:43:42.296 --> 00:43:45.926
the gestures and la
parole, the discourse of

00:43:45.926 --> 00:43:48.526
strikes.
Now, what about the 1890s,

00:43:48.526 --> 00:43:51.519
and the first decade of the
twentieth century?

00:43:51.519 --> 00:43:55.887
It's transformed completely,
particularly in big factories,

00:43:55.887 --> 00:44:00.104
because something has come
along to change the way people

00:44:00.104 --> 00:44:06.011
view their own work experience.
And this is called industrial

00:44:06.011 --> 00:44:09.960
discipline, industrial
discipline.

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:14.909
And the strikes--then the boss
is often in Paris sending

00:44:14.909 --> 00:44:20.579
telegrams to Limoges saying how
they should deal--they being the

00:44:20.579 --> 00:44:23.239
foremen,
deal with the workers.

00:44:23.239 --> 00:44:28.722
He has become a symbol of
capitalism, defended by the army

00:44:28.722 --> 00:44:32.184
of the State,
in the view of militant

00:44:32.184 --> 00:44:36.038
syndicalists,
militant union people who had

00:44:36.038 --> 00:44:38.639
the right after 1881 to
organize.

00:44:38.639 --> 00:44:43.627
He is a symbol of this
structure of a large-scale

00:44:43.627 --> 00:44:48.199
industrialization that they
can't control.

00:44:48.199 --> 00:44:52.597
And he is off in his chateau,
on his boat in Normandie,

00:44:52.597 --> 00:44:56.831
or something like that,
but he has been--the voice of

00:44:56.831 --> 00:45:01.656
him is now the foreman.
And the foreman enters the

00:45:01.656 --> 00:45:07.010
game, enters--not the game,
but enters the workshop,

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:11.439
and he represents the attempts
to impose industrial discipline

00:45:11.439 --> 00:45:16.159
on people whose parents or even
them had always worked at home,

00:45:16.159 --> 00:45:18.965
and you worked when it was
light, or you worked-- when you

00:45:18.965 --> 00:45:21.179
had done nursing your baby then
you'd work.

00:45:21.179 --> 00:45:24.457
And when you wanted to go for a
stroll to have a smoke or have a

00:45:24.457 --> 00:45:27.157
drink you did that.
But the foreman puts up

00:45:27.157 --> 00:45:31.003
regulations that you will be
fined if a plate is broken,

00:45:31.003 --> 00:45:34.849
you'll be fined for chattering.
There was a horrible fire in

00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:38.050
Brooklyn that killed 140 women
who'd been sort of locked in,

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:40.492
in about 1910 or 1911,
because they were chattering,

00:45:40.492 --> 00:45:42.119
they were going out in the
back,

00:45:42.119 --> 00:45:44.570
instead of working and talking,
and so they all burned to

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:46.514
death.
And the regulations told them

00:45:46.514 --> 00:45:49.980
that you will be fined if you do
this, you'll be fired if you do

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:51.837
this.
And the person that enforces

00:45:51.837 --> 00:45:54.654
them is the foreman.
The foreman is promoted from

00:45:54.654 --> 00:45:57.849
within or, increasingly,
brought from the outside to

00:45:57.849 --> 00:46:00.920
impose industrial discipline on
these workers.

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.073
The Wedgwood Pottery
manufacturer,

00:46:03.073 --> 00:46:06.010
some of you've heard of that,
he once said,

00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:09.802
very prophetically,
in 1807 or 1808 he said,

00:46:09.802 --> 00:46:15.006
"what I want to do is I want my
workers to be like hands who

00:46:15.006 --> 00:46:16.788
move,
and who act,

00:46:16.788 --> 00:46:21.565
and who react to the commands
of my brain, and they will do

00:46:21.565 --> 00:46:25.688
what I want them to do."
So, the factory--and this is in

00:46:25.688 --> 00:46:27.892
England, too,
is--if you can think of

00:46:27.892 --> 00:46:30.647
assembly lines,
I used to work at Kellogg's of

00:46:30.647 --> 00:46:33.675
Battle Creek.
I did the raisin bran,

00:46:33.675 --> 00:46:37.789
I put the raisins into snack
pack, I did that.

00:46:37.789 --> 00:46:40.565
And I worked at Alice Love's
Jams and Jellies in Portland,

00:46:40.565 --> 00:46:42.805
Oregon, and all this,
and we hated the foreman,

00:46:42.805 --> 00:46:44.849
I'll tell you that,
we just hated him;

00:46:44.849 --> 00:46:46.844
so, at least I could hate
them--I don't hate them,

00:46:46.844 --> 00:46:48.390
but I did hate them,
sure I hated them,

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:51.220
of course we hated them.
But the foremen are the people

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:54.487
who put the regulations up,
who punish you for trying to be

00:46:54.487 --> 00:46:57.530
yourself, who--trying to leave
to see your friends.

00:46:57.530 --> 00:47:00.140
And then the foremen,
they create these factories as

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.289
a way of imposing industrial
discipline.

00:47:02.289 --> 00:47:04.169
When you see-- and that's not
the only reason,

00:47:04.169 --> 00:47:06.090
because you need factories for
big machines;

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:08.460
these machines I can never--I'd
forget how to work them.

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.889
I worked in a canning plant,
I could never--I was supposed

00:47:10.889 --> 00:47:13.020
to work this machine,
I could never--I'd forget how

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:14.577
to work it.
It would get jammed all the

00:47:14.577 --> 00:47:15.800
time and I'd always get in
trouble.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.380
So that's maybe--it's all
coming out now.

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:20.154
But, what they do is they
create--when you have workers

00:47:20.154 --> 00:47:23.340
wanting to have their pictures
taken, when you have cameras;

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.968
and when they're taking their
pictures together,

00:47:25.968 --> 00:47:28.428
like a football team or like a
baseball team,

00:47:28.428 --> 00:47:31.560
they're always in front of the
door, of the factory.

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.473
Why?
Because there are very few

00:47:34.473 --> 00:47:36.739
doors, and there's a clock over
the door.

00:47:36.739 --> 00:47:39.312
It is now the clock,
it's the siren that tells you

00:47:39.312 --> 00:47:41.812
when you can come and go;
not when you're hungry,

00:47:41.812 --> 00:47:44.731
not when your baby needs to be
nursed, not when you've just had

00:47:44.731 --> 00:47:47.414
it up to here with breathing
dust and know you're going to

00:47:47.414 --> 00:47:50.289
get TB and croak,
from that, in lots of places.

00:47:50.289 --> 00:47:55.468
And that's what imposes this,
industrial discipline comes

00:47:55.468 --> 00:47:58.951
from these foremen.
And, so, strikes are often

00:47:58.951 --> 00:48:01.480
against foremen.
There was a strike in Limoges

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:04.678
of women workers who were forced
to kneel down and pray before

00:48:04.678 --> 00:48:07.719
the workday, and they strike
against women foremen too.

00:48:07.719 --> 00:48:11.433
Now, not all of them were
egregious but nonetheless this

00:48:11.433 --> 00:48:15.214
was a way of them--a way of
viewing--their experience was

00:48:15.214 --> 00:48:19.400
shaped by the necessity of being
at one place at one time,

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:22.461
and if you're not there,
"see ya'," that's the end of

00:48:22.461 --> 00:48:25.561
that, you better be there,
and imposed industrial

00:48:25.561 --> 00:48:30.569
discipline inside the workplace.
I did a film for--a documentary

00:48:30.569 --> 00:48:34.402
for FR3 on Limoges,
on the strikes in 1905,

00:48:34.402 --> 00:48:39.239
and we did part of it--it was
one-hundred degrees,

00:48:39.239 --> 00:48:42.624
literally, it was forty-one,
and we did it in the ruins of

00:48:42.624 --> 00:48:45.144
the Havilland factory,
with dead pigeons,

00:48:45.144 --> 00:48:47.940
and plates and the door wasn't
there anymore;

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:50.618
but, I'd seen it before,
you could feel what it meant to

00:48:50.618 --> 00:48:52.614
these people,
that they had their pictures

00:48:52.614 --> 00:48:55.389
and they said goodbye to
comrades who had been fired,

00:48:55.389 --> 00:48:57.280
who had been let go because
there wasn't enough money;

00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.500
it was pretty bad.
So, the industrial discipline,

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:04.030
in an attempt to create this
kind of perfect workforce,

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:06.927
what it does is it creates
resentment and it helps

00:49:06.927 --> 00:49:10.121
explain-- there are other
reasons too--but this kind of

00:49:10.121 --> 00:49:13.433
mobilization of ordinary people.
Now, let me just finish with

00:49:13.433 --> 00:49:15.376
the following story,
because this is an amazing

00:49:15.376 --> 00:49:17.869
thing and a few of you in other
courses have heard this,

00:49:17.869 --> 00:49:20.280
but I tell it because it's just
so--it was prophetic.

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:23.045
It was again this wonderful
historian Michelle Perrot,

00:49:23.045 --> 00:49:25.863
and she wrote an article I
published in a collection of

00:49:25.863 --> 00:49:28.890
essays a long time ago called
"The Three Ages of Industrial

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:32.296
Discipline."
And it parallels the view of

00:49:32.296 --> 00:49:37.139
the other, where you're
against--the guy is trying to,

00:49:37.139 --> 00:49:40.264
the patron is trying to get
you--the patron was trying to

00:49:40.264 --> 00:49:42.624
get you to produce this plate,
and this stuff,

00:49:42.624 --> 00:49:44.615
and these shoes and all of
that, and then pretty soon

00:49:44.615 --> 00:49:46.988
there's the foreman that tells
you how many things you're going

00:49:46.988 --> 00:49:49.776
to do.
But, what happens in the 1900s

00:49:49.776 --> 00:49:54.271
at a time when the Olympics
start, and you're counting how

00:49:54.271 --> 00:49:57.452
far--or restart,
how quickly you can run the

00:49:57.452 --> 00:49:59.510
one-hundred meters,
or whatever?

00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:03.313
And an engineer called
Taylor--Taylorism--an American

00:50:03.313 --> 00:50:07.702
comes up with a way of measuring
productivity by counting the

00:50:07.702 --> 00:50:12.857
units that you can produce,
how many little God-awful bags

00:50:12.857 --> 00:50:17.960
of--boxes of raisin bran I
produce in so many hours,

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:20.552
and they count them,
and if you don't count enough

00:50:20.552 --> 00:50:23.145
you're out of there,
if you don't have enough-- we

00:50:23.145 --> 00:50:25.571
weren't unionized,
we couldn't be unionized

00:50:25.571 --> 00:50:28.626
then--you're out of there.
And what happens then--and

00:50:28.626 --> 00:50:31.333
Taylorism becomes very
important, Ford loves

00:50:31.333 --> 00:50:33.599
Taylorism--and the car
producers,

00:50:33.599 --> 00:50:37.283
Renault embraces Taylorism,
it's just an unbelievable

00:50:37.283 --> 00:50:39.264
thing.
And there's an old story when a

00:50:39.264 --> 00:50:42.002
tailor, or some French engineer,
comes to an American company

00:50:42.002 --> 00:50:44.080
and says,
"well, all the workers are

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:47.023
young here"-- this was a
Taylorism place-- "all the

00:50:47.023 --> 00:50:49.360
workers are young,
where are the old ones?"

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:51.300
He says, "Come on along,
we'll have a smoke in the

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:54.236
cemetery and you'll see."
And Michelle Perrot said,

00:50:54.236 --> 00:50:57.746
predicted in 1978 that the kind
of surveillance,

00:50:57.746 --> 00:51:02.226
or the kind of counting of the
assembly line production would

00:51:02.226 --> 00:51:06.414
give way to what she called,
in an amazing thing-- think

00:51:06.414 --> 00:51:09.992
about our post-Industrial world
of the cubicles of people

00:51:09.992 --> 00:51:13.221
answering phone calls,
and doing computer line work

00:51:13.221 --> 00:51:16.483
will give way--the way you
measure performance and create

00:51:16.483 --> 00:51:19.920
industrial discipline--will give
way to what she called,

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:23.373
beautifully,
the quiet violence of the

00:51:23.373 --> 00:51:26.260
computer.
And it did.

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:27.726
See you on Wednesday.

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.408
Prof: Okay,
but now I want to move to the

00:00:03.408 --> 00:00:05.975
next topic,
which is the topic called the

00:00:05.975 --> 00:00:10.153
Capital Asset Pricing Model,
and it's in some points the

00:00:10.153 --> 00:00:12.120
high point of the class.
 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.090
It used to be the high point of
finance.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.771
The theory hasn't worked out as
well as people thought in recent

00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:21.997
times,
but it's quite a great

00:00:21.997 --> 00:00:25.680
achievement and a lot of it was
done here at Yale,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.810
so I want to explain it to you.
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.970
So you see we have a problem so
far.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.201
If everybody's trying to hedge
that means everybody's trying to

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.590
get a completely riskless
payoff.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.583
It's impossible because,
I mean, there's real risk in

00:00:39.583 --> 00:00:40.390
the economy.
 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.300
And what do we mean by real
risk?

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.471
Well, something in one state is
just going to be bad for the

00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:48.730
whole economy compared to
another state.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.860
Maybe we'll run out of oil or
something like that.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.415
It's impossible that everybody
can consume the same thing in

00:00:54.415 --> 00:00:56.708
every state,
so it's impossible that

00:00:56.708 --> 00:00:59.683
everybody can perfectly hedge,
but everybody wants to

00:00:59.683 --> 00:01:00.490
perfectly hedge.
 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.990
So what has to happen?
 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.859
What gives?
 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.760
How does the theory have to
change?

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.640
Well, the theory's going to
change in a simple way,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.483
which Shakespeare himself
already knew and already told us

00:01:12.483 --> 00:01:14.629
about in The Merchant of
Venice.

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:18.137
What's going to happen is
everybody is going to try and

00:01:18.137 --> 00:01:21.060
hedge as much as they can by
diversifying,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.290
but because there's some real
risk in the economy,

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.638
in some states things will be
in the aggregate worse than they

00:01:29.638 --> 00:01:31.920
will be in other states.
 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.849
So what's the consequence of
that?

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:37.867
The consequence of that is if
you're going to buy an asset

00:01:37.867 --> 00:01:40.937
that pays something that's
riskless you're going to pay the

00:01:40.937 --> 00:01:43.319
discounted expected return of
the asset,

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:46.646
but if you're going to buy an
asset that's risky you're going

00:01:46.646 --> 00:01:50.029
to need a higher rate of return
so the price will be less than

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:51.970
the expected discounted payoff.
 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.330
So Shakespeare,
remember, said exactly that.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.778
When the play begins with
Antonio looking melancholy his

00:01:58.778 --> 00:02:02.498
interlocutor says,
Salerio or somebody asks him

00:02:02.498 --> 00:02:06.218
whether he's worried about his
businesses.

00:02:06.218 --> 00:02:08.372
He says, "No,
I've got a different

00:02:08.372 --> 00:02:10.923
ship--every ship's on a
different ocean so I'm

00:02:10.923 --> 00:02:11.830
diversified.
 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.210
I'm not that worried."
 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.746
So Shakespeare knows about
diversification and that's what

00:02:15.746 --> 00:02:18.556
everybody should do,
but then when it comes time to

00:02:18.556 --> 00:02:21.889
pick the caskets to get to marry
the beautiful Portia,

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.450
who by the way is not just
beautiful but she's rich so

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.318
they're looking for a prize,
but they sign a contract that

00:02:28.318 --> 00:02:33.300
whoever picks the wrong casket
not only doesn't get Portia,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.940
he can never marry anyone in
the future.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.960
So what's the purpose of that
contract?

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.310
It's to make it a very risky
gamble.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.765
And so why did Shakespeare want
to make it a risky gamble,

00:02:42.765 --> 00:02:45.050
so he could explain he
understands risk and return.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.646
So you remember the
conversation where everybody

00:02:46.646 --> 00:02:47.955
says,
"Well, I'm not going to

00:02:47.955 --> 00:02:49.676
pick this unless,
you know, it's only because

00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:51.940
she's so rich and so beautiful
that I'm willing to do this.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.068
The return is so high that it's
worth the risk to me."

00:02:55.068 --> 00:02:58.054
So Shakespeare already
understood that things that are

00:02:58.054 --> 00:03:01.433
risky are going to have to be
priced less than their expected

00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:03.455
return--
expected payoff--so the

00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:06.056
expected return,
that is the payoff per dollar

00:03:06.056 --> 00:03:09.098
put into it looks higher to
compensate you for the risk.

00:03:09.098 --> 00:03:11.310
So Shakespeare almost had the
whole story.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.128
What's missing from Shakespeare?
 

00:03:13.128 --> 00:03:16.470
Well, what is the definition of
risk is missing from

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.466
Shakespeare, and it will turn
out that it's going to be a very

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:22.169
surprising definition.
 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.330
So the purpose of the model I'm
going to explain is,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.066
how do you measure risk,
and how should that affect the

00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:30.845
price of things,
and how does that affect all

00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:32.919
the analysis we've done so far?
 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.449
So that's the topic of the next
couple lectures.

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:40.186
So the first person to confront
this problem and propose a

00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:44.757
solution, a mathematical
solution, was the mathematician

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:47.250
Bernoulli and his brother.
 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.221
So the Bernoullis were a famous
mathematical family,

00:03:50.221 --> 00:03:52.610
and one of the brothers went
off to St.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.662
Petersburg where he ended up
dying shortly afterwards,

00:03:58.662 --> 00:04:05.057
but he noticed the following
puzzle, and some of you have

00:04:05.057 --> 00:04:08.598
heard this, it's called the St.
 

00:04:08.598 --> 00:04:11.340
Petersburg Paradox.
 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.408
So suppose I offer you a bet.
 

00:04:13.408 --> 00:04:18.898
I say I'm going to flip a coin,
and I keep flipping the coin

00:04:18.898 --> 00:04:23.913
until it comes up tails,
and I count how many coin flips

00:04:23.913 --> 00:04:26.740
I've counted until you get
tails,

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.680
and if that's N flips you get 2
to the N dollars.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.083
So if you flip it 1 time and it
comes up tails right away,

00:04:34.083 --> 00:04:37.009
which is probability 1 half,
you get 2 dollars.

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.016
If I flip it 2 times and it
gets heads and then tails,

00:04:41.016 --> 00:04:45.327
that's with probability 1
quarter, you've flipped it twice

00:04:45.327 --> 00:04:48.050
you get 2 to the 2 or 4 dollars.
 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.490
If I flip it three times and I
get heads,

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.507
heads, tails the odds of that
are 1 half times 1 half times 1

00:04:53.507 --> 00:04:55.038
half,
which is 1 eighth,

00:04:55.038 --> 00:04:57.550
but then you'll get 2 to the 3
dollars.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:07.560
So 4 8 1 over 2 to the N times
2 to the N ....

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.101
So Bernoulli,
the one who died,

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:14.338
told his brother Daniel about
this and he said,

00:05:14.338 --> 00:05:16.603
"Well, I've offered this
bet to a bunch of people and I

00:05:16.603 --> 00:05:19.502
asked them,
how much would they be willing

00:05:19.502 --> 00:05:22.259
to pay for this risky
asset?"

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:25.310
I mean, what would you pay?
 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.129
Let's hear some numbers?
 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:29.639
How many dollars would you pay
if I offered you this bet?

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.300
I'm just going to keep flipping
a fair coin, count the number of

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.379
flips until a tails and pay you
2 to the N dollars.

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:41.220
So this is the expectation
which obviously equals infinity.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.886
So according to what we've said
so far you should pay infinite

00:05:43.886 --> 00:05:46.240
amount of dollars for it,
but Bernoulli couldn't get

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.850
anyone to offer him that much
money.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.209
How much would you offer for
this bet?

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:53.500
I just want to hear some
numbers.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.720
Student: 1 dollar fifty.
 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.629
Prof: 1 dollar fifty.
 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:01.064
Anybody else have any-- it's
pretty conservative,

00:06:01.064 --> 00:06:05.129
I mean, that's almost
ridiculous, in fact.

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:08.086
You're guaranteed 2 dollars no
matter what happens,

00:06:08.086 --> 00:06:08.560
right?
 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.845
So you're paying 1 dollar fifty
and you're going to get 2 for

00:06:10.845 --> 00:06:13.115
sure,
so that's a pretty conservative

00:06:13.115 --> 00:06:15.466
number to say,
anybody a little more

00:06:15.466 --> 00:06:16.930
venturesome than that?
 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.810
You can't do worse than 2
dollars in this bet.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:20.540
Student: 4 dollars.
 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.170
Prof: What?
 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.779
Student: 4 dollars.
 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:23.170
Prof: 4 dollars.
 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.576
All right, so Bernoulli asked a
bunch of people and the average

00:06:27.576 --> 00:06:31.129
of what they say happens to have
been 4 dollars.

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:33.990
That's what they said on
average.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.720
And so Bernoulli said,
"Well, this is amazing.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.882
The expectation is infinite and
they're only willing to pay me a

00:06:38.882 --> 00:06:40.740
miserable 4 dollars for
this."

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.723
Now, the real reason might have
been that they didn't believe

00:06:43.723 --> 00:06:46.160
Bernoulli was actually going to
pay the money,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.262
and they'd give up their money
and they weren't going to get

00:06:48.262 --> 00:06:49.949
anything back,
but let's ignore that

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:51.750
temporarily and take it
seriously.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.064
Bernoulli said,
the solution must be that

00:06:55.064 --> 00:06:58.709
people don't care about the
dollar payoff.

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:01.120
They care about the utility of
the dollar payoff.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.500
So let's put in a utility
function.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:10.437
So the utility of the dollar
payoff would be [one half]

00:07:10.437 --> 00:07:17.634
U of 2 1 quarter U of 4 1
eighth U of 8 1 over 2 to the N

00:07:17.634 --> 00:07:20.589
U of 2 to the N ...
 

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:23.718
And so then he said--well,
of course why is that going to

00:07:23.718 --> 00:07:24.110
help?
 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.790
Well, because if the utility
function,

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.089
say, looks like this--so here's
X and here's U of X--

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:33.913
the more dollars you get,
maybe it increases utility but

00:07:33.913 --> 00:07:36.798
by less and less,
so you're not really gaining

00:07:36.798 --> 00:07:39.720
much by getting these numbers
way out here.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.254
They're not adding really much
to utility, so you only care

00:07:42.254 --> 00:07:43.480
about these small numbers.
 

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.855
I mean, it's good to get more,
but not much better to have

00:07:46.855 --> 00:07:47.269
more.
 

00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:52.175
So he said, lo and behold,
if I put in log natural as my

00:07:52.175 --> 00:07:55.654
utility function,
which this looks like,

00:07:55.654 --> 00:08:00.560
that's the graph of log
natural, and I put this in.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:07.101
Now, you see this is easy to
solve, to compute,

00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:13.930
because log of 2 to the N is N
times log of 2.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.959
So the log of 2s come out and
it's just the sum.

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:27.060
It's log of 2 times the sum of
1 over 2 to the N times N.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.600
So it's N over 2 to the N.
 

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.812
So this is equal to log of 2
times the sum,

00:08:33.812 --> 00:08:39.769
N equals 1 to the infinity,
N over 2 to the N.

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:45.940
That's what it turns out,
that this thing is that.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.491
So it's not just 1 over 2 to
the N which would have added up

00:08:48.491 --> 00:08:49.788
to 1, but N over 2 to the N.
 

00:08:49.788 --> 00:08:54.273
So the point is because you
have the log function here this

00:08:54.273 --> 00:08:56.668
actually equals the log of 4.
 

00:08:56.668 --> 00:08:59.740
So anyway, I've worked out the
arithmetic.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:00.538
It's very simple.
 

00:09:00.538 --> 00:09:03.028
You all know how to sum 1 over
2 to the N.

00:09:03.028 --> 00:09:05.538
You probably don't know how to
sum N over 2 to the N.

00:09:05.538 --> 00:09:08.028
You never thought of doing it
before, but the same trick gets

00:09:08.028 --> 00:09:09.769
you to be able to sum N over 2
to the N.

00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:12.253
It's obviously more than 1 over
2 to the N, in fact,

00:09:12.253 --> 00:09:13.129
it's equal to 2.
 

00:09:13.129 --> 00:09:17.414
So this sum is equal to 2 and 2
times log of 2 is log of 2

00:09:17.414 --> 00:09:19.519
squared which is log of 4.
 

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:24.662
So by plugging in--instead of
caring about expectation you

00:09:24.662 --> 00:09:27.730
care about the expected utility.
 

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.860
You can explain why the average
person was willing to pay 4

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.206
dollars because the expected log
of this is equal to the log of

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:34.529
4.
 

00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:36.860
This is equal to the log of 4.
 

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.750
So Bernoulli thought he'd
brilliantly explained his

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:41.529
paradox.
 

00:09:41.529 --> 00:09:42.918
So this is the other brother,
Daniel.

00:09:42.918 --> 00:09:45.000
The dead brother posed the
problem,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.340
maybe solved it too for all I
know,

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:53.548
but the other brother who still
lived came up with the solution,

00:09:53.548 --> 00:09:56.994
maybe with his brother,
that people don't look at

00:09:56.994 --> 00:10:00.120
expected payoffs,
they look at expected utility

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.000
of payoffs,
and the utility should have

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.475
this concave feature that more
and more payoff adds on the

00:10:07.475 --> 00:10:09.990
margin less and less utility.
 

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:16.773
So this function satisfies d
squared U (X) / dX squared is

00:10:16.773 --> 00:10:18.440
less than 0.
 

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.470
The second derivative is
negative.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.211
So the marginal utility is
declining as you get more and

00:10:23.211 --> 00:10:23.558
more.
 

00:10:23.558 --> 00:10:30.440
So that was the first advance
on how to deal with risk.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:35.474
Now, actually Bernoulli didn't
really solve the problem because

00:10:35.474 --> 00:10:40.591
just saying that you replace the
payoff with expected utility of

00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:43.874
a concave function--
this log wouldn't have really

00:10:43.874 --> 00:10:47.158
solved the problem,
because suppose that Bernoulli

00:10:47.158 --> 00:10:52.027
had offered instead a bet not of
2 to the N but of 2 to the 2 to

00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:54.620
the N,
a much more generous bet?

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.889
Then even with logs you would
have gotten an infinite number.

00:10:58.889 --> 00:11:03.297
So basically he should have
said that people care about a

00:11:03.297 --> 00:11:08.177
concave function of payoff where
the function is bounded unlike

00:11:08.177 --> 00:11:10.460
log which is not bounded.
 

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:11.820
But anyway, let's leave that
aside.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.879
It should be a concave function.
 

00:11:14.879 --> 00:11:18.052
So to put it another way,
a concave function has the

00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:20.023
property,
if you look at it,

00:11:20.023 --> 00:11:24.099
let's say it looks like that,
that if you have this payoff

00:11:24.099 --> 00:11:28.389
X_A and this payoff
X_B and you've got--

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:33.350
so this is the utility now
here, X_A,

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.058
and this is the utility U of
X_B,

00:11:36.058 --> 00:11:40.080
and this is the utility U of
X_A.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.426
If you have a 50/50 bet of
either getting X_A or

00:11:43.426 --> 00:11:46.537
getting X_B you're
going to end up with this

00:11:46.537 --> 00:11:47.769
expected utility.
 

00:11:47.769 --> 00:11:50.248
Your utility is going to be 1
half of U X_A 1 half

00:11:50.248 --> 00:11:51.129
of U X_B.
 

00:11:51.129 --> 00:11:53.970
That's what we had down here,
1 half of this utility plus

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.808
half of that utility assuming
nothing else can happen.

00:11:56.808 --> 00:12:02.658
But if you give the person half
the amounts of money for sure

00:12:02.658 --> 00:12:08.798
then he gets this utility which
is much bigger than that utility

00:12:08.798 --> 00:12:12.600
because this is a concave
function.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.230
The extra you gain by winning
the bet,

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.908
compared to getting the average
for sure,

00:12:17.908 --> 00:12:20.735
the extra you gain doesn't
drive the utility up very much

00:12:20.735 --> 00:12:22.250
because it's flattening out.
 

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.432
Whereas losing the bet,
even though you're losing the

00:12:24.432 --> 00:12:27.033
same number of dollars because
from here to here is the same as

00:12:27.033 --> 00:12:29.443
from here to here,
the loss of the same number of

00:12:29.443 --> 00:12:32.527
dollars is more important to you
than the gain of an equal amount

00:12:32.527 --> 00:12:35.023
of dollars,
and that's why you'd rather get

00:12:35.023 --> 00:12:38.513
the middle for sure than having
a 50/50 chance of going on the

00:12:38.513 --> 00:12:39.200
extremes.
 

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.754
So Bernoulli pointed the way to
the modern theory of risk

00:12:43.754 --> 00:12:49.806
aversion,
which is to just assume--risk

00:12:49.806 --> 00:13:00.308
aversion in modern economics
means people care about expected

00:13:00.308 --> 00:13:05.552
utility,
maybe discounted,

00:13:05.552 --> 00:13:16.278
expected discounted utility
where the utility is concave.

00:13:16.278 --> 00:13:19.791
So whatever utility function we
wrote in here,

00:13:19.791 --> 00:13:24.240
maybe it shouldn't be log,
it should be something else.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.759
How would people evaluate this?
 

00:13:25.759 --> 00:13:27.668
They'd evaluate it log of 4.
 

00:13:27.668 --> 00:13:31.028
In other words,
they'd say take whatever that

00:13:31.028 --> 00:13:34.082
constant utility was,
which was log of 4,

00:13:34.082 --> 00:13:38.360
that produces the same utility
as the random gamble.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.221
So this random gamble gives
this expected utility which is

00:13:42.221 --> 00:13:44.730
equivalent to having that for
sure.

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.950
So here's the 4.
 

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:51.062
So 4 for sure gives a utility,
log of 4, that puts you here

00:13:51.062 --> 00:13:54.962
which is the same as the
expected utility of getting the

00:13:54.962 --> 00:13:56.240
random gamble.
 

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:01.730
That's the modern theory of
risk aversion,

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.578
and it explains why people
would rather have things for

00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:08.462
sure,
but it's now quantifiable

00:14:08.462 --> 00:14:13.735
because if you can't have
something for sure then you know

00:14:13.735 --> 00:14:18.686
that it's more dangerous,
but with this concrete utility

00:14:18.686 --> 00:14:22.917
function you can find out
exactly how much you're willing

00:14:22.917 --> 00:14:27.450
to pay to transform this risky
gamble into a safe gamble.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:31.394
You'd give up this much
expectation in order to get the

00:14:31.394 --> 00:14:32.710
payoff for sure.
 

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:37.128
So we're going to turn a vague
theory into something

00:14:37.128 --> 00:14:41.200
quantifiable and get a
surprising conclusion.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.490
So that's step one.
 

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.620
We now think about people
maximizing utility.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.240
Well, of course we thought
about that from the beginning.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.573
The very first class you had
utility and diminishing marginal

00:14:50.573 --> 00:14:51.129
utility.
 

00:14:51.129 --> 00:14:54.721
So actually this risk aversion
with diminishing marginal

00:14:54.721 --> 00:14:56.383
utility,
fortunately for us,

00:14:56.383 --> 00:14:59.363
is exactly the same thing we've
been thinking about all along

00:14:59.363 --> 00:15:01.327
anyway,
diminishing marginal utility

00:15:01.327 --> 00:15:02.190
for consumption.
 

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.975
So the very assumption of
diminishing marginal utility

00:15:04.975 --> 00:15:07.816
that we made from the beginning
is also explaining risk

00:15:07.816 --> 00:15:08.500
aversion.
 

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.275
So it's incredibly fortunate
that we don't actually have to

00:15:12.275 --> 00:15:15.793
change any of our mathematics
and we've explained a new

00:15:15.793 --> 00:15:16.769
phenomenon.
 

00:15:16.769 --> 00:15:22.344
Now, the most simple utility
function is either the log one

00:15:22.344 --> 00:15:24.168
or the quadratic.
 

00:15:24.168 --> 00:15:32.668
So remember,
U (X) = a b X - c X squared.

00:15:32.668 --> 00:15:37.714
Adding a constant is never
going to change anything,

00:15:37.714 --> 00:15:43.253
so I'm always going to write
this as a X - 1 half alpha X

00:15:43.253 --> 00:15:44.440
squared.
 

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:49.649
That's going to be my utility
function, my quadratic utility.

00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:51.470
It could be like this or it
could be like that.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.320
If you add a constant which
doesn't depend on X that's not

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.870
changing what anybody does so
that's irrelevant,

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.722
and if I divide it by a
constant like B that's not going

00:16:00.722 --> 00:16:04.785
to change what everybody does so
I might as well assume the

00:16:04.785 --> 00:16:08.500
quadratic utility is X - 1 half
alpha X squared,

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.528
quadratic utility.
 

00:16:09.528 --> 00:16:12.297
So that's about as simple as we
can get and we're used to

00:16:12.297 --> 00:16:14.668
working with those kinds of
utility functions.

00:16:14.668 --> 00:16:19.269
Now, why is that such a good
convenient thing for us to use?

00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:22.544
It's because let's suppose now
that you've got this random

00:16:22.544 --> 00:16:25.934
payoff where with probability
gamma_1 you're going

00:16:25.934 --> 00:16:28.682
to get X_1,
probability gamma_2

00:16:28.682 --> 00:16:30.240
you're going to get
X_2,

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.690
probability gamma_S
you're going to get

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.139
gamma_S [correction:
X_S].

00:16:35.139 --> 00:16:38.120
So what's the expected utility,
the analog of Bernoulli?

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:45.302
That means U is going to equal
summation, s = 1 to S of

00:16:45.302 --> 00:16:51.288
(gamma_s
X_s- 1 half alpha

00:16:51.288 --> 00:16:54.879
X_s squared).
 

00:16:54.879 --> 00:16:56.649
So that's all we're doing.
 

00:16:56.649 --> 00:16:59.048
We're just saying that people
don't care about the payoffs.

00:16:59.048 --> 00:17:02.217
They have to evaluate getting
X_1,

00:17:02.217 --> 00:17:04.650
X_2 or X_S.
 

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:09.707
They're going to multiply the
payoff by the expectation but

00:17:09.707 --> 00:17:14.589
not look at the payoff itself,
look at the utility of the

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:15.548
payoff.
 

00:17:15.548 --> 00:17:18.657
Now, quadratic is very simple
and the reason why we're going

00:17:18.657 --> 00:17:21.925
to get such a beautiful theory
out of it is because this number

00:17:21.925 --> 00:17:24.981
you don't have to keep track of
all the X's to express this

00:17:24.981 --> 00:17:25.720
utility.
 

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.269
We're going to be able to
summarize it incredibly simply.

00:17:29.269 --> 00:17:35.703
This is going to equal some
function F of the expectation of

00:17:35.703 --> 00:17:38.538
X and the variance of X.
 

00:17:38.538 --> 00:17:41.191
So all we're going to have to
worry about is the expectation

00:17:41.191 --> 00:17:43.314
of X and the variance of X,
and so many,

00:17:43.314 --> 00:17:47.250
many very complicated things we
can think about very simply.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:50.530
So more generally if you put
the log instead of the quadratic

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:53.811
utility we couldn't get this
simplification and so the theory

00:17:53.811 --> 00:17:55.890
would have to be more
complicated.

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.178
So the beautiful theory,
the Capital Asset Pricing

00:17:59.178 --> 00:18:03.068
Model, comes out of using this
simple quadratic utility.

00:18:03.068 --> 00:18:06.088
So why does it get so
simplified?

00:18:06.088 --> 00:18:11.409
Well, if I just write it out,
U is going to equal the

00:18:11.409 --> 00:18:16.318
summation of gamma_s
X_s,

00:18:16.318 --> 00:18:21.368
so this is s = 1 to S (I've let
my probabilities be gamma,

00:18:21.368 --> 00:18:25.170
I don't know why I chose that)
- 1 half alpha,

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:32.644
summation s = 1 to S,
of gamma_s

00:18:32.644 --> 00:18:37.019
X_s squared.
 

00:18:37.019 --> 00:18:41.358
Well, here we have the
expectation of X already.

00:18:41.358 --> 00:18:44.404
Now, what is this 1 F alpha
gamma_s X_s

00:18:44.404 --> 00:18:44.930
squared?
 

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:51.150
Well, if I wrote X_s
- the expectation of X and I

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:57.155
summed this squared that's equal
the variance of X--oops,

00:18:57.155 --> 00:19:00.160
times gamma_s.
 

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.192
That by definition is the
variance, but if I wrote this

00:19:04.192 --> 00:19:05.910
out what would I get?
 

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:10.660
I'd get summation s = 1 to S,
gamma_s X_s

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:15.490
squared which is what I have
over there and then I'd have--

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:23.599
well, what would I have-- minus
2 times summation

00:19:23.599 --> 00:19:34.246
gamma_s X_s
expectation of X summation s = 1

00:19:34.246 --> 00:19:43.539
to S of gamma_s
expectation of X squared.

00:19:43.539 --> 00:19:47.210
But what's this?
 

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.009
The second term minus 2 times
that,

00:19:50.009 --> 00:19:53.490
the expectation of X is a
constant so I can take that out,

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:57.452
minus 2 expectation of X,
can take this out and notice

00:19:57.452 --> 00:20:01.190
that summation gamma_s
X_s,

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.940
that's the expectation of X as
well.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:08.480
So that's just minus 2 times
the expectation of X squared.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.519
And so this I can take the
expectation of X squared out and

00:20:13.519 --> 00:20:17.170
the summation of the
probabilities is 1.

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:22.623
So therefore I just get equal
to summation s = 1 to S,

00:20:22.623 --> 00:20:28.694
gamma_s X_s
squared - (expectation of X)

00:20:28.694 --> 00:20:29.930
squared.
 

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:35.750
So therefore,
this up here is equal to the

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.450
expectation of X.
 

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:39.460
So what have I got here?
 

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.650
I've got this term.
 

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.760
So I've got the variance of X
equals this summation

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.182
X_s X_s
squared - (expectation of X)

00:20:49.182 --> 00:20:49.930
squared.
 

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:54.084
So this term equals the
variance of X (expectation of X)

00:20:54.084 --> 00:20:54.838
squared.
 

00:20:54.838 --> 00:21:02.858
So therefore I've got this
minus 1 half alpha (expectation

00:21:02.858 --> 00:21:09.190
of X) squared - 1 half alpha
variance of X.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:13.278
That's what the algebra gives
me, so why is that again?

00:21:13.278 --> 00:21:18.297
Because given quadratic utility
up here, that thing--getting

00:21:18.297 --> 00:21:23.653
old--given the quadratic utility
up there I can write it as this

00:21:23.653 --> 00:21:25.098
in this term.
 

00:21:25.098 --> 00:21:28.294
This term is obviously the
expectation of X,

00:21:28.294 --> 00:21:31.785
but this term is just the
variance of X plus the

00:21:31.785 --> 00:21:33.940
expectation of X squared.
 

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.920
So when I subtract it I keep
the expectation of X minus the

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.910
(expectation of X) squared.
 

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:43.026
That's the first term,
and then I've got minus the

00:21:43.026 --> 00:21:46.460
variance of X from that term
times the 1 half alpha.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:51.134
So you see that depends on the
expectation of X in a positive

00:21:51.134 --> 00:21:55.885
way, assuming alpha's a small
number, and in a negative way on

00:21:55.885 --> 00:21:57.598
the variance of X.
 

00:21:57.598 --> 00:22:01.667
So, just as I said,
somewhere, I said it was going

00:22:01.667 --> 00:22:05.568
to turn out like that,
and it did right here.

00:22:05.568 --> 00:22:08.884
The utility is equal to the
expectation of X and the

00:22:08.884 --> 00:22:12.785
variance of X in a positive way
on the expectation of X and a

00:22:12.785 --> 00:22:14.930
negative way on the variance.
 

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:20.058
So now we're ready to start the
analysis.

00:22:20.058 --> 00:22:24.124
So far we've assumed people
only care about the expectation

00:22:24.124 --> 00:22:27.346
and then we said,
well, we know they don't only

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:29.588
care about the expectations.
 

00:22:29.588 --> 00:22:32.105
Hedge funds and everybody else,
if they know what they're doing

00:22:32.105 --> 00:22:34.703
and they're trying to keep their
investors happy they're going to

00:22:34.703 --> 00:22:35.108
hedge.
 

00:22:35.108 --> 00:22:36.890
We didn't say why they're going
to hedge.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:40.498
We just asserted they like to
hedge so their investors don't

00:22:40.498 --> 00:22:43.202
get mad at them,
but really what we had in mind

00:22:43.202 --> 00:22:45.519
is the investors have some
utility function.

00:22:45.519 --> 00:22:49.337
They don't like risk so the
hedge fund is going to try and

00:22:49.337 --> 00:22:51.079
keep the payoffs steady.
 

00:22:51.079 --> 00:22:51.980
But there's a tradeoff.
 

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.380
You can't eliminate all risk.
 

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:57.573
So, how much is the hedge fund
and the investor going to suffer

00:22:57.573 --> 00:22:59.170
if all risk isn't eliminated?
 

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.720
Now we have a way of
quantifying it.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.627
People care about the utility
and not about just the expected

00:23:04.627 --> 00:23:07.430
payoff and so you add more risk
to them--

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:10.198
you replace a sure thing with a
risky thing with the same

00:23:10.198 --> 00:23:12.469
expectation--
they think it is worse,

00:23:12.469 --> 00:23:13.598
that much worse.
 

00:23:13.598 --> 00:23:17.567
And so we've said that of all
the myriad of utility

00:23:17.567 --> 00:23:20.517
functions--
we could use log,

00:23:20.517 --> 00:23:24.690
some exponential e to the minus
aX,

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.770
X to the r, there are lots of
different utilities we could

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:29.692
use--
we're going to deal with the

00:23:29.692 --> 00:23:32.505
quadratic because it has the
simple property that in

00:23:32.505 --> 00:23:35.537
evaluating an entire risky
proposition people care about

00:23:35.537 --> 00:23:38.848
the expectation,
which is what they cared about

00:23:38.848 --> 00:23:41.638
before,
but they're punishing

00:23:41.638 --> 00:23:45.650
themselves for getting a bad
variance.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.449
So because that's such a simple
thing to say we're going to get

00:23:49.449 --> 00:23:52.818
a simple conclusion and a very
surprising conclusion.

00:23:52.818 --> 00:24:01.288
So let's now analyze a problem
and see what would happen.

00:24:01.288 --> 00:24:06.759
So the problem I'm going to
choose to analyze is this one.

00:24:06.759 --> 00:24:18.247
I'm going to say that three
things can happen in the

00:24:18.247 --> 00:24:20.500
economy.
 

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.920
Anyway, those are the
probabilities.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.088
Now, there are many firms in
the economy A,

00:24:25.088 --> 00:24:28.700
B and C, and let's say the
first firm,

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.462
I don't want to invent the
numbers here so I might as well

00:24:32.462 --> 00:24:34.838
just write down the ones I
picked.

00:24:34.838 --> 00:24:41.930
The first one's going to be
50,100 and 75.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:51.434
B, the other firm's going to be
150,180 and 365,

00:24:51.434 --> 00:24:59.118
and C is going to be 300,220
and 60.

00:24:59.118 --> 00:25:03.666
So those are the three things
that can happen in the payoff of

00:25:03.666 --> 00:25:05.009
the three firms.
 

00:25:05.009 --> 00:25:16.720
Let's say there are two agents,
agent alpha owns A and also

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:22.980
133.5 units of X_0.
 

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:32.773
And beta owns B &amp;
C and--I may have reversed

00:25:32.773 --> 00:25:42.359
these two guys--66.5 units of
X_0.

00:25:42.359 --> 00:25:43.279
So here we go.
 

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:46.199
So by alpha and beta,
I mean, there are a million

00:25:46.199 --> 00:25:49.848
alpha agents and a million beta
agents so everything could be

00:25:49.848 --> 00:25:53.194
scaled by a million because I
want a big economy like we

00:25:53.194 --> 00:25:54.289
always have.
 

00:25:54.289 --> 00:25:55.359
So there we have it.
 

00:25:55.359 --> 00:25:58.079
We've got now a risky world.
 

00:25:58.079 --> 00:25:59.569
Things can happen.
 

00:25:59.569 --> 00:26:02.190
So what are the utilities?
 

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:07.246
Let's say utility now of alpha
is going to equal--sorry,

00:26:07.246 --> 00:26:09.818
I left out the main point.
 

00:26:09.818 --> 00:26:15.868
Utility of alpha is going to
equal 1 half X_0--

00:26:15.868 --> 00:26:17.430
I just made up these numbers,
by the way,

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:22.328
they're not--so summation s = 1
to 3,

00:26:22.328 --> 00:26:25.108
gamma_s,
that's the gamma_s up

00:26:25.108 --> 00:26:29.440
there,
times X_s - 1 over

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:34.740
400 X_s squared,
the states.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.180
So there's s_1.
 

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:38.130
So here are the states.
 

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:43.440
This is state 1,
s = 1, s = 2 and s = 3.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:49.961
So those are the three possible
states just like we had before

00:26:49.961 --> 00:26:56.588
with this payoff and those are
the payoff of all the assets.

00:26:56.588 --> 00:27:00.990
Alpha owns firm A which is
producing that output in the

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.332
three states,
and also owns 133.5 units of

00:27:04.332 --> 00:27:05.798
X_0.
 

00:27:05.798 --> 00:27:11.967
So over here alpha's owning
133.5 and beta's owning 65.5 of

00:27:11.967 --> 00:27:14.519
consumption at time 0.
 

00:27:14.519 --> 00:27:18.078
So this is time 0.
 

00:27:18.078 --> 00:27:22.460
This is time 1,
the end of the year.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:26.420
So by the end of the year
something is going to happen.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.630
There's a lot of uncertainty
between now and then.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:33.247
Some of the firms are going to
be paying off in some of the

00:27:33.247 --> 00:27:36.828
states and badly in other states
and so on.

00:27:36.828 --> 00:27:39.720
And so the utility function for
alpha,

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.813
so he cares about consumption
at time 0 and also in each of

00:27:42.813 --> 00:27:45.528
the three states,
but now he's going to have

00:27:45.528 --> 00:27:47.240
these quadratic utilities.
 

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:55.563
He's going to say to himself,
if I just hung onto my A in

00:27:55.563 --> 00:28:00.772
state 1 this would be--
if I never traded,

00:28:00.772 --> 00:28:05.915
I just hung onto A the utility
function would be this quadratic

00:28:05.915 --> 00:28:07.410
thing of 133.5.
 

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:14.528
So it would be 133.5 - 1 over
400,

00:28:14.528 --> 00:28:23.442
133.5 squared,
plus he would end up with (50 -

00:28:23.442 --> 00:28:34.731
1 over 400 times 50 squared)
times 1 quarter (100 - 1 over

00:28:34.731 --> 00:28:46.615
400 100 squared) times 1 quarter
(75 - 1 over 400 75 squared)

00:28:46.615 --> 00:28:50.380
times 1 half.
 

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.509
That would be his utility if he
never traded.

00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:58.684
If he just stuck to A he'd eat
his own endowment 133.5 at time

00:28:58.684 --> 00:28:59.089
0.
 

00:28:59.089 --> 00:29:00.338
Oh, that isn't true.
 

00:29:00.338 --> 00:29:02.670
I wrote down the wrong utility
at time 0.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.049
I said his time 0 utility is 1
half X_0.

00:29:05.049 --> 00:29:08.368
So it's 1 half 133.5.
 

00:29:08.368 --> 00:29:13.869
So we get 1 half 133.5,
but in the future he'd get 50

00:29:13.869 --> 00:29:18.525
in state 1,100 in state 2,
and 75 in state 3,

00:29:18.525 --> 00:29:23.180
and that's the utility he'd end
up with.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:26.053
But that's not very good for
him because he's running this

00:29:26.053 --> 00:29:26.858
gigantic risk.
 

00:29:26.858 --> 00:29:30.317
He's got this risk at time,
you know--state 1 is a disaster

00:29:30.317 --> 00:29:33.596
for him if he just sticks to
that, so he doesn't want to

00:29:33.596 --> 00:29:34.670
stick to that.
 

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.460
So how should he evaluate the
shares of firm A?

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.749
How should he evaluate the
shares of firm B which he could

00:29:40.749 --> 00:29:44.038
get if he gave up some of A,
or how should he evaluate the

00:29:44.038 --> 00:29:45.250
shares of firm C?
 

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:46.460
What should he do?
 

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:52.980
So beta has a similar utility.
 

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:57.916
Beta's utility,
U_beta is going to

00:29:57.916 --> 00:30:03.430
equal 3 quarters X_0
the summation,

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:18.308
s = 1 to 3, (gamma_s
times X_s - 1 over 800

00:30:18.308 --> 00:30:24.308
X_s squared).
 

00:30:24.308 --> 00:30:28.431
So I've made these guys--far
from being impatient they seem

00:30:28.431 --> 00:30:31.700
to prefer consuming in the
future until now.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.318
That was a poor choice of
numbers.

00:30:34.318 --> 00:30:39.157
This number should be bigger
than 1 and this should be bigger

00:30:39.157 --> 00:30:43.108
than 1, but anyway I put 1 half
and 3 quarters.

00:30:43.108 --> 00:30:46.108
So there's impatience built in
except it goes the wrong way.

00:30:46.108 --> 00:30:49.928
That was just poor choice of
numbers, but the rest of it

00:30:49.928 --> 00:30:52.150
expresses their risk aversion.
 

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:55.916
So alpha is looking at the
expected payoff of what he gets

00:30:55.916 --> 00:30:59.486
to consume in the future,
but he's punishing himself by

00:30:59.486 --> 00:31:00.608
the variance.
 

00:31:00.608 --> 00:31:03.154
So you look at this formula you
see it's not just the

00:31:03.154 --> 00:31:05.553
expectation, but he loses
something because of the

00:31:05.553 --> 00:31:06.190
variance.
 

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:08.213
And similarly,
beta, he's looking at

00:31:08.213 --> 00:31:10.554
consumption today,
he's adding to that the

00:31:10.554 --> 00:31:13.390
expectation of his consumption
tomorrow for his utility,

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:19.009
but he's punishing himself for
having variance in the future.

00:31:19.009 --> 00:31:22.769
So it's exactly what we
formalized,

00:31:22.769 --> 00:31:28.007
Shakespeare's idea of people
not liking to be exposed to

00:31:28.007 --> 00:31:30.532
variance,
to uncertainty,

00:31:30.532 --> 00:31:34.589
which we've quantified by
calling variance.

00:31:34.589 --> 00:31:35.779
Is everyone with me now?
 

00:31:35.779 --> 00:31:36.200
Yes?
 

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.548
Good, I'm glad you have a
question.

00:31:37.548 --> 00:31:39.165
Student: I don't
understand how you got 1 over

00:31:39.165 --> 00:31:39.818
400 and 1 over 800.
 

00:31:39.818 --> 00:31:41.720
Prof: I just made up
those numbers.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.150
That's the utility of alpha and
that's the utility of beta.

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:45.619
I could pick any people I
wanted.

00:31:45.619 --> 00:31:47.980
I just picked those two people.
 

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:49.630
Now, how do they differ?
 

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:56.098
Which person is more afraid of
risk than the other?

00:31:56.098 --> 00:31:58.549
Is alpha or beta more afraid of
risk?

00:31:58.549 --> 00:32:00.608
Student: Alpha.
 

00:32:00.608 --> 00:32:01.772
Prof: Alpha is more
afraid of risk,

00:32:01.772 --> 00:32:02.000
right?
 

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.910
This 1 over 800 is smaller than
1 over 400,

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:09.230
so beta doesn't really care
that much about risk,

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:12.907
well cares, but is not going to
punish himself too much by being

00:32:12.907 --> 00:32:13.960
exposed to risk.
 

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.673
Alpha is not going to punish
himself too much,

00:32:16.673 --> 00:32:19.509
but is going to punish himself
somewhat more.

00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:21.880
So alpha is more risk averse.
 

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:32.900
Alpha is more afraid of risk,
it seems.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.430
So I've taken two agents who
are afraid of risk,

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:39.537
one's more afraid than the
other, and I've put them in an

00:32:39.537 --> 00:32:42.700
economy where there are risky
things that could happen.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:48.777
And so we now want to work out
a more sophisticated version of

00:32:48.777 --> 00:32:53.558
pricing and of equilibrium than
we had before.

00:32:53.558 --> 00:32:58.277
So let me remind you that what
we sort of have been supposing

00:32:58.277 --> 00:33:02.873
up until now is that the price--
what would the price of A be if

00:33:02.873 --> 00:33:05.170
we didn't think about risk
aversion?

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:13.453
So far what we would say--what
would you say the price of A is,

00:33:13.453 --> 00:33:15.858
price of firm A?
 

00:33:15.858 --> 00:33:19.940
If we were naive you might say
it is 1 quarter--

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:23.598
by the way, I hope I have those
probabilities right--

00:33:23.598 --> 00:33:34.095
you'd say it is 1 quarter times
50 1 quarter times 100 1 half

00:33:34.095 --> 00:33:36.019
times 75.
 

00:33:36.019 --> 00:33:40.710
Is that what we would have said
up until now?

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:43.086
Even up until now we would have
been more sophisticated than

00:33:43.086 --> 00:33:43.369
that.
 

00:33:43.369 --> 00:33:44.279
Student: Discounted.
 

00:33:44.279 --> 00:33:50.318
Prof: Discounted,
times discounted.

00:33:50.318 --> 00:33:53.019
That's what we sort of figured
up until now.

00:33:53.019 --> 00:33:54.890
That's the logical thing to do.
 

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:59.785
Well, but we ignored risk
aversion, and we ignored it at

00:33:59.785 --> 00:34:03.788
our peril because it's obviously
important.

00:34:03.788 --> 00:34:05.848
I mean, Shakespeare,
a literary person,

00:34:05.848 --> 00:34:09.057
he understood already 400 years
ago that risk aversion was

00:34:09.057 --> 00:34:11.498
important,
and there are facts that

00:34:11.498 --> 00:34:14.420
confirm what Shakespeare's
intuition is.

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:17.592
The stock market historically
has had a lot higher return than

00:34:17.592 --> 00:34:18.530
the bond market.
 

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:21.039
Even with the last stock market
crash,

00:34:21.039 --> 00:34:24.416
of course it came back a lot,
averaged since 1926 the stock

00:34:24.416 --> 00:34:28.027
market's made something like 9
percent a year compared to 2 and

00:34:28.027 --> 00:34:30.239
1 half percent in the bond
market.

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:33.487
So there's a huge disparity and
after over such a long period of

00:34:33.487 --> 00:34:36.425
time it can't just be it was
luckier every year after year

00:34:36.425 --> 00:34:37.199
after year.
 

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:40.021
Somehow people must have
realized the stock market is

00:34:40.021 --> 00:34:42.211
riskier,
and so as Shakespeare said they

00:34:42.211 --> 00:34:45.500
wanted a higher return meaning
they were paying a lower price,

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.889
but how much lower?
 

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:48.659
How can you figure out how much
lower?

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:50.347
So in this example,
in other words,

00:34:50.347 --> 00:34:51.590
what is the price of A?
 

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:56.442
So this is the wrong price of
A, apparently,

00:34:56.442 --> 00:35:01.519
because it doesn't recognize
risk aversion.

00:35:01.519 --> 00:35:04.510
So that's where we are.
 

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:06.719
So any questions about what the
question is?

00:35:06.719 --> 00:35:07.940
We're about to give an answer.
 

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.489
So you see what the question
is, that our old methodology for

00:35:11.489 --> 00:35:15.054
figuring out prices--
that's taking expectation and

00:35:15.054 --> 00:35:17.284
discounting--
obviously can't be right

00:35:17.284 --> 00:35:19.420
because it doesn't recognize
risk aversion.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.458
On the other hand,
we always had a utility

00:35:21.458 --> 00:35:23.449
function in there from the
beginning,

00:35:23.449 --> 00:35:26.228
even a quadratic one,
so all we have to do is do what

00:35:26.228 --> 00:35:29.061
we did before and put in a
quadratic utility and we'll

00:35:29.061 --> 00:35:30.880
probably get the right answer.
 

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.360
So that's exactly what we're
going to do.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:37.721
So Arrow, in 1951,
this is the same guy who proved

00:35:37.721 --> 00:35:42.260
with Debreu the Pareto
efficiency of equilibrium.

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.570
He was my thesis advisor.
 

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:48.820
He said we can do the same
trick that Fisher did,

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:53.070
only for some reason he never
credited Fisher.

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:54.760
I could never quite figure that
out.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.579
He had some obscure Danish guy
he credited.

00:35:57.579 --> 00:36:17.159
But anyway, apply Fisher trick
and assume firm dividends are

00:36:17.159 --> 00:36:24.130
part of endowments.
 

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:32.246
Look for GE,
the general equilibrium,

00:36:32.246 --> 00:36:39.010
trading outputs,
trading goods,

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:48.480
then go back to deduce value of
firms.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.530
Now, what goods are we trading
here?

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:53.400
That was a conceptual advance.
 

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:59.380
We call them Arrow and then
Debreu got involved too.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:03.195
Arrow-Debreu,
so Debreu was the Yale

00:37:03.195 --> 00:37:09.190
Assistant Professor while Arrow
was a Stanford Assistant

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:15.730
Professor, so Arrow-Debreu State
Contingent Commodities.

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:18.726
So, just as Fisher said,
an apple today and an apple

00:37:18.726 --> 00:37:20.695
next year,
even though they're identical

00:37:20.695 --> 00:37:22.403
apples,
are different commodities with

00:37:22.403 --> 00:37:24.893
different prices because they
come at different places in

00:37:24.893 --> 00:37:25.250
time.
 

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:28.369
In fact, most people would
prefer the apple today to the

00:37:28.369 --> 00:37:29.389
apple next year.
 

00:37:29.389 --> 00:37:35.025
So Arrow said an apple in the
top state is a different

00:37:35.025 --> 00:37:40.235
commodity from the same apple in
the second state,

00:37:40.235 --> 00:37:44.489
so it should have a different
price.

00:37:44.489 --> 00:37:46.762
So we've got just our
conventional equilibrium

00:37:46.762 --> 00:37:49.844
according to Arrow where as long
as you have these Arrow state

00:37:49.844 --> 00:37:52.219
contingent commodities that you
can trade--

00:37:52.219 --> 00:37:55.186
trading today,
you can imagine today buying an

00:37:55.186 --> 00:37:59.340
apple if state 1 occurs but not
having to get the apple if state

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:02.239
2 or state 3 occurs,
and that'll have a price

00:38:02.239 --> 00:38:03.018
P_1.
 

00:38:03.018 --> 00:38:05.585
And today you could imagine
buying the apple if state 2

00:38:05.585 --> 00:38:07.619
occurs,
a different price from the

00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:10.896
apple if state 1 occurs,
and also an apple if state 3

00:38:10.896 --> 00:38:12.827
occurs,
which obviously is going to be

00:38:12.827 --> 00:38:15.360
more expensive,
or it looks like it'll be more

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.922
expensive than the other apples
because it's 50 percent likely

00:38:18.922 --> 00:38:21.246
to happen,
and those are the prices we

00:38:21.246 --> 00:38:22.250
have to look for.
 

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:25.998
And that's going to solve our
problem because the prices of

00:38:25.998 --> 00:38:29.230
the Arrow securities are going
to be different,

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:32.766
maybe, from the probabilities
and that's what will reflect the

00:38:32.766 --> 00:38:35.608
fact that when everybody's
trying to hedge and not

00:38:35.608 --> 00:38:39.610
everybody can do it you're going
to have to change the tradeoffs.

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:41.927
So we've already seen this in
our gambling thing,

00:38:41.927 --> 00:38:42.989
at least the prices.
 

00:38:42.989 --> 00:38:45.994
Remember with our bookies the
bookies were effectively

00:38:45.994 --> 00:38:49.625
willing--remember there were two
outcomes, the Yankees win or the

00:38:49.625 --> 00:38:50.590
Phillies win.
 

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:55.550
You could get the bookie who
thought the odds were 60/40,

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:58.742
by paying 60 cents today the
bookie was going to give you 1

00:38:58.742 --> 00:39:02.257
dollar if the Yankees won,
or paying 40 cents today the

00:39:02.257 --> 00:39:05.750
bookie will give you 1 dollar if
the Phillies won.

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:08.317
So we've already had these
Arrow contracts,

00:39:08.317 --> 00:39:11.679
these Arrow securities
implicitly in our equilibrium.

00:39:11.679 --> 00:39:15.592
And those 60/40 odds those were
the opinions of the bookie,

00:39:15.592 --> 00:39:18.090
maybe not the actual
probabilities.

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:21.822
We said the final betting odds
depended on what the other

00:39:21.822 --> 00:39:23.889
bookies were willing to give.
 

00:39:23.889 --> 00:39:25.889
It didn't have to correspond to
reality.

00:39:25.889 --> 00:39:27.610
There might not be a reality
even.

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:29.809
So here there's a reality,
25,25,

00:39:29.809 --> 00:39:32.210
50, but that doesn't mean that
the odds,

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:34.628
the prices they're going to
quote in the market are going to

00:39:34.628 --> 00:39:35.530
turn out to be that.
 

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:41.168
We have to solve for
equilibrium and see what they

00:39:41.168 --> 00:39:41.860
are.
 

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.300
So what's going to happen?
 

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:48.909
Well, we can solve for
equilibrium very easily because

00:39:48.909 --> 00:39:53.250
we've done this a million times
before.

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:56.277
And I've chosen linear
quadratic utilities,

00:39:56.277 --> 00:39:59.594
the kind we did on the very
first day of class,

00:39:59.594 --> 00:40:03.559
because those are easiest to
solve for equilibrium.

00:40:03.559 --> 00:40:06.436
You don't have to get involved
in the budget set or anything

00:40:06.436 --> 00:40:07.119
complicated.
 

00:40:07.119 --> 00:40:10.050
You just set marginal utility
equal to price.

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:13.713
So we know for alpha,
sorry, we know that the

00:40:13.713 --> 00:40:18.710
marginal utility of alpha at
time 0 divided by the price 0 is

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:23.208
going to have to equal the
marginal utility of alpha at

00:40:23.208 --> 00:40:27.289
each state s times the price
P_s.

00:40:27.289 --> 00:40:35.579
So the equilibrium,
the Arrow-Debreu equilibrium,

00:40:35.579 --> 00:40:38.021
is going to involve
P_0,

00:40:38.021 --> 00:40:40.186
P_1,
P_2 and

00:40:40.186 --> 00:40:42.159
P_3,
the prices of the Arrow

00:40:42.159 --> 00:40:44.690
securities,
the present value prices.

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:48.000
P_0 is what you pay
today to get the apple today.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.617
P_1 is what you pay
today to get the apple a year

00:40:51.617 --> 00:40:52.989
from now in state 1.
 

00:40:52.989 --> 00:41:00.914
So these are the present value
(that's what Fisher would say)

00:41:00.914 --> 00:41:04.349
state contingent prices.
 

00:41:04.349 --> 00:41:07.679
The state contingent is what
Arrow added.

00:41:07.679 --> 00:41:10.088
Now, you may ask whether there
really are these Arrow

00:41:10.088 --> 00:41:11.849
securities floating in the
economy,

00:41:11.849 --> 00:41:13.179
and we're going to come back to
that question,

00:41:13.179 --> 00:41:17.512
but you could imagine all these
Arrow-Debreu state contingent

00:41:17.512 --> 00:41:20.789
prices and commodities,
and those would be the prices

00:41:20.789 --> 00:41:22.139
we'd solve for equilibrium.
 

00:41:22.139 --> 00:41:26.909
So we get this over this,
marginal utility of that.

00:41:26.909 --> 00:41:29.409
So what is this?
 

00:41:29.409 --> 00:41:33.987
And similarly for beta,
marginal utility^(beta) at 0

00:41:33.987 --> 00:41:37.041
over the price of 0 equals
marginal

00:41:37.041 --> 00:41:41.619
utility^(beta)_s over
the price of s.

00:41:41.619 --> 00:41:42.360
So what is this?
 

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:49.360
For alpha, his marginal utility
of consumption is 1 half.

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:53.079
We might as well assume one of
the prices is 1.

00:41:53.079 --> 00:41:55.300
Let's take this price to be 1.
 

00:41:55.300 --> 00:42:00.833
So beta, her marginal utility
is 3 quarters and the price is

00:42:00.833 --> 00:42:01.210
1.
 

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:06.829
What's his marginal utility in
any state s?

00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:17.679
It is gamma_s times
(1 - 1 over 200 times

00:42:17.679 --> 00:42:21.369
X_s).
 

00:42:21.369 --> 00:42:22.550
So I just differentiated this.
 

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:26.309
I got 1 - 2 over 400 times
X_s.

00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:28.909
And what's her marginal utility?
 

00:42:28.909 --> 00:42:36.447
It is gamma_s in
state s times (1 - 1 over 400

00:42:36.447 --> 00:42:39.599
times X_s).
 

00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:52.699
So I know in equilibrium that's
going to imply that 1 half--

00:42:52.699 --> 00:42:54.550
well, now I have to screw
around here,

00:42:54.550 --> 00:43:00.396
so how am I going to--so I've
got this thing over here 1 half

00:43:00.396 --> 00:43:03.320
equals this thing over here.
 

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.018
What?
 

00:43:04.018 --> 00:43:05.019
Student: Over
P_s.

00:43:05.019 --> 00:43:06.650
Prof: Over P_s.
 

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:08.610
Ah, glad that appeared.
 

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:10.170
I was getting worried there.
 

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:10.840
Thank you.
 

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:17.360
Over P_s,
that helps a lot.

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:21.731
So that implies that something
like X--so this is what alpha is

00:43:21.731 --> 00:43:25.329
going to do and this is what
beta is going to do.

00:43:25.329 --> 00:43:29.346
So this implies
X^(alpha)_s equals

00:43:29.346 --> 00:43:30.000
what?
 

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.402
So if I multiply through by
200, and I bring P_s

00:43:33.402 --> 00:43:36.030
over gamma_s to the
other side,

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:41.146
and I do a bunch of stuff,
I'm going to guess this is 200

00:43:41.146 --> 00:43:45.260
- 100 P_s over
gamma_s.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:48.230
How do you think that's going
to play in Peoria?

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.760
Let's see.
 

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.532
If I multiply through by
P_s over

00:43:51.532 --> 00:43:54.239
gamma_s I get
P_s over

00:43:54.239 --> 00:43:56.550
gamma_s times 1 half.
 

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:59.190
Then I multiply everything
through by 200.

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:01.960
So I get 100 P_s over
gamma_s,

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:05.766
and then I get the 200 here,
and the X_s goes to

00:44:05.766 --> 00:44:07.646
the other side,
and the P_s over

00:44:07.646 --> 00:44:08.739
gamma_s goes to the
other side.

00:44:08.739 --> 00:44:11.260
So it's 200 - 100 P_s
over gamma_s.

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:16.456
And this one is going to
be--X^(beta)_s is

00:44:16.456 --> 00:44:19.768
going to equal--
well, I have to do the same

00:44:19.768 --> 00:44:22.998
trick here except I'm going to
be multiplying through by 400

00:44:22.998 --> 00:44:25.079
and taking 3 quarters which is
300.

00:44:25.079 --> 00:44:36.577
So it'll be 300 minus--no,
that was wrong,

00:44:36.577 --> 00:44:50.320
400 - 300 P_s over
gamma_s.

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.889
Because if I multiply through
by 400,

00:44:52.889 --> 00:44:54.936
put P_s over
gamma_s on the other

00:44:54.936 --> 00:44:56.510
side I have 3 quarters
P_s over

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:59.005
gamma_s times 400,
which is 300 P_s over

00:44:59.005 --> 00:44:59.739
gamma_s.
 

00:44:59.739 --> 00:45:02.467
This becomes a 400 and the
P_s gamma_s

00:45:02.467 --> 00:45:03.760
went away so I have that.
 

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:08.288
So I know now if I could figure
out what the prices are I know

00:45:08.288 --> 00:45:11.630
what everybody would demand in
every state.

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:16.139
So let me pause here.
 

00:45:16.139 --> 00:45:17.809
That was the first critical
step.

00:45:17.809 --> 00:45:18.920
So what did I do?
 

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.219
I said it's a long story.
 

00:45:21.219 --> 00:45:23.130
A lot of years went into this.
 

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:25.010
I said people are risk averse.
 

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:26.400
Shakespeare knew that.
 

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:29.905
We want to quantify it so we
say people have concave utility

00:45:29.905 --> 00:45:30.619
functions.
 

00:45:30.619 --> 00:45:32.070
That quantifies risk aversion.
 

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:34.570
We want to make a simple
concave utility function.

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:36.739
We pick quadratic,
but of course we don't know

00:45:36.739 --> 00:45:37.559
what quadratic.
 

00:45:37.559 --> 00:45:39.842
Different people could have
different quadratic utility

00:45:39.842 --> 00:45:40.349
functions.
 

00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:43.469
Then we do the Fisher trick and
say that any equilibrium,

00:45:43.469 --> 00:45:46.851
as long as you can buy and sell
every contingent commodity in

00:45:46.851 --> 00:45:48.550
the future,
because all the Arrow

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:51.166
securities are there,
it can always be reduced to

00:45:51.166 --> 00:45:53.860
general equilibrium just like we
did before.

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:59.378
And so now you have to feed the
endowments into the agents'--I

00:45:59.378 --> 00:46:03.902
mean the payoffs and the
dividends into the agents'

00:46:03.902 --> 00:46:05.260
endowments.
 

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:06.650
So we haven't done that yet.
 

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:09.070
And then we solve for supply
equals demand.

00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:14.911
So all we have to do is we have
to have X^(alpha)_s

00:46:14.911 --> 00:46:20.559
X^(beta)_s has to
equal the endowment of alpha in

00:46:20.559 --> 00:46:24.260
s plus the endowment of beta in
s.

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:27.500
All right, so we have to do
that for every s.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:33.112
So this is 200 - 100
P_sS over

00:46:33.112 --> 00:46:41.750
gamma_s equals--now we
have to do it in state 1.

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:43.670
So it equals whatever they are.
 

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:48.510
So what is endowment of alpha
of s plus endowment beta of s?

00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:51.280
We have to look at each state
separately.

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:55.385
And lo and behold I picked the
numbers so that if you add these

00:46:55.385 --> 00:47:00.155
all together you get 500,
and here you get 280 and 220 is

00:47:00.155 --> 00:47:05.239
also 500,
and here you get 500 again.

00:47:05.239 --> 00:47:09.355
So lo and behold there is no
aggregate risk in the economy,

00:47:09.355 --> 00:47:13.329
although the individual stocks
are risky the aggregate is

00:47:13.329 --> 00:47:14.820
totally un-risky.
 

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:19.809
So no matter what s is,
I could put in 500 here.

00:47:19.809 --> 00:47:22.518
It's going to turn out that the
total endowment of both people,

00:47:22.518 --> 00:47:24.608
because I've plugged the
dividends into their personal

00:47:24.608 --> 00:47:27.086
endowments,
added up the two people,

00:47:27.086 --> 00:47:27.889
it's 500.
 

00:47:27.889 --> 00:47:33.768
So it means that P_s
over gamma_s equals...

00:47:33.768 --> 00:47:37.045
Student:
&gt;

00:47:37.045 --> 00:47:38.110
you forgot.
 

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:38.789
Prof: What?
 

00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:41.139
Student: You forgot the
second term.

00:47:41.139 --> 00:47:42.980
Prof: I've forgotten
something for sure,

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:43.260
what?
 

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.510
Student: X^(beta).
 

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:46.650
Prof: Oh, X^(beta).
 

00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:51.630
So that's alpha.
 

00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:53.789
Thank you.
 

00:47:53.789 --> 00:48:02.760
Plus 400 - 300 P_s
over gamma_s = 500.

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:08.710
So if when I add this up I get
600 - 400 P_s over

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:13.103
gamma_s = 500,
so then I flip them to the

00:48:13.103 --> 00:48:15.476
other side and I get
P_s over

00:48:15.476 --> 00:48:19.141
gamma_s = 1 quarter,
because 500 from here is 100

00:48:19.141 --> 00:48:22.170
and put the 400 on the other
side and divide by it I get

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:24.592
P_s over
gamma_s equals 1

00:48:24.592 --> 00:48:25.860
quarter for all s.
 

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:31.019
So what did I find?
 

00:48:31.019 --> 00:48:32.630
So it's the same.
 

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:39.543
P_s over
gamma_s is the same,

00:48:39.543 --> 00:48:42.570
same in all states.
 

00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:46.300
So what would the price of A be
here?

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:55.949
What's the price of A in
equilibrium?

00:48:55.949 --> 00:48:57.530
What's the price of A?
 

00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:05.827
I'm going to take the price of
A should be P_1 times

00:49:05.827 --> 00:49:12.494
50 P_2 times 100
P_3 times 75,

00:49:12.494 --> 00:49:16.440
and what does that equal?
 

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:21.655
Well, P_1 is just 1
quarter times gamma_1,

00:49:21.655 --> 00:49:22.340
right?
 

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.969
P_1 over
gamma_1 is 1 quarter.

00:49:24.969 --> 00:49:28.070
P_2 is 1 quarter
times gamma_2,

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:30.489
and P_3 is 1 quarter
times gamma_3,

00:49:30.489 --> 00:49:34.179
so I just got this multiplied
by 1 quarter.

00:49:34.179 --> 00:49:36.579
So in fact all I did is I did
what I had always done.

00:49:36.579 --> 00:49:39.369
I took the expected payoff and
discounted it.

00:49:39.369 --> 00:49:41.268
The discount rate is 1 quarter.
 

00:49:41.268 --> 00:49:44.369
What's the price of the
riskless asset,

00:49:44.369 --> 00:49:49.329
pi of (1,1, 1),
is just going to be 1 quarter,

00:49:49.329 --> 00:49:51.902
because it's 1 quarter times
gamma 1 1 quarter times gamma 2

00:49:51.902 --> 00:49:55.197
1 quarter times gamma 3,
gamma 1 gamma 2 gamma 3 is 1 so

00:49:55.197 --> 00:49:56.289
it's 1 quarter.
 

00:49:56.289 --> 00:50:02.659
So it implies the riskless
interest rate is what?

00:50:02.659 --> 00:50:04.489
What's the riskless interest
rate?

00:50:04.489 --> 00:50:05.340
Student: 300 percent.
 

00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:07.119
Prof: 300 percent.
 

00:50:07.119 --> 00:50:10.507
So we're discounting by 1 over
1 quarter because the interest

00:50:10.507 --> 00:50:11.750
rate is 300 percent.
 

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:13.518
So basically nothing happened.
 

00:50:13.518 --> 00:50:16.621
We got all the prices exactly
as we would compute them

00:50:16.621 --> 00:50:19.431
without, you know,
just doing expectations we got

00:50:19.431 --> 00:50:21.070
the right discount rate.
 

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:23.019
All we had to do was figure out
the discount rate.

00:50:23.019 --> 00:50:25.159
So risk hasn't played any role.
 

00:50:25.159 --> 00:50:26.590
And why didn't it play any role?
 

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:30.733
Because although alpha started
off owning A alone which exposed

00:50:30.733 --> 00:50:34.878
her--forgot who was her and who
was him, let's say her--exposed

00:50:34.878 --> 00:50:36.550
her to a lot of risk.
 

00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:39.420
She's not going to sit there
stupidly just holding A.

00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:42.099
She's going to trade it for B
and C for different shares.

00:50:42.099 --> 00:50:45.699
In fact she's going to end up
holding her consumption,

00:50:45.699 --> 00:50:48.199
this is her consumption,
200 - 100 P_s over

00:50:48.199 --> 00:50:51.039
gamma_s,
this number doesn't depend on s.

00:50:51.039 --> 00:50:54.592
She's going to consume the same
thing in every state,

00:50:54.592 --> 00:50:56.369
and how can she do that?
 

00:50:56.369 --> 00:50:59.619
She can own equal shares of A,
B and C.

00:50:59.619 --> 00:51:01.670
She'll own a share of the whole
economy.

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:12.197
So in other words,
by diversifying alpha and beta

00:51:12.197 --> 00:51:18.119
each get rid of all risk.
 

00:51:18.119 --> 00:51:21.485
So instead of calling it
diversifying I could call it

00:51:21.485 --> 00:51:23.170
hedging, the same thing.
 

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:24.570
She doesn't just hold her A.
 

00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:27.385
She mixes B and C with it so
that she gets a payoff of

00:51:27.385 --> 00:51:30.414
consumption that's exactly the
same in every state because

00:51:30.414 --> 00:51:33.070
P_s over
gamma_s is independent

00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:34.079
of the state.
 

00:51:34.079 --> 00:51:35.869
She'll always consume the same
thing.

00:51:35.869 --> 00:51:38.693
Everybody can hedge perfectly
and there's no problem because

00:51:38.693 --> 00:51:41.659
there's no aggregate risk that
anyone has to be stuck with,

00:51:41.659 --> 00:51:45.637
and therefore the price is just
going to be the same as the

00:51:45.637 --> 00:51:47.489
probabilities discounted.
 

00:51:47.489 --> 00:51:49.949
And that's the theory we've
worked with so far.

00:51:49.949 --> 00:51:53.056
So, so far you could say that
everything we did was kosher

00:51:53.056 --> 00:51:56.434
it's just that when we had these
two different probabilities of

00:51:56.434 --> 00:51:59.487
things happening up or down we
thought that the aggregate

00:51:59.487 --> 00:52:03.139
economy would have the same
endowments here as it did there,

00:52:03.139 --> 00:52:06.634
and therefore the probabilities
we used were the objective

00:52:06.634 --> 00:52:08.289
probabilities discounted.
 

00:52:08.289 --> 00:52:10.811
No reason to change them
because nobody's going to be

00:52:10.811 --> 00:52:11.880
forced not to hedge.
 

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.250
Everybody'll hedge.
 

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:16.829
So are there any questions
about what I've said?

00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:19.643
I'm sure there should be a
question because I can't have

00:52:19.643 --> 00:52:21.690
said it as clearly as I ought to
have.

00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:27.690
So would somebody like to say
something?

00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:28.579
Yes?
 

00:52:28.579 --> 00:52:30.731
Student:
&gt;

00:52:30.731 --> 00:52:33.529
the old price that we found
when we hadn't done this,

00:52:33.529 --> 00:52:35.518
but that also change the new
one?

00:52:35.518 --> 00:52:37.510
Prof: This is the new
price with the 1 quarter.

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:39.500
This is the correct new price.
 

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:42.789
So the theory so far hasn't
changed in any interesting way.

00:52:42.789 --> 00:52:44.829
We just found the discount rate.
 

00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:46.849
It just looks like expected
utility,

00:52:46.849 --> 00:52:49.733
but you shouldn't have expected
it to change because the

00:52:49.733 --> 00:52:52.940
aggregate endowment was 500,
the constant in every state.

00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:57.003
There's no reason why we can't
have everybody perfectly hedged

00:52:57.003 --> 00:52:59.869
and consuming a constant in
every state,

00:52:59.869 --> 00:53:01.349
and in fact that's what we did
have,

00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:03.809
everybody--she consumed the
same thing in every state.

00:53:03.809 --> 00:53:06.329
He consumed the same thing in
every state.

00:53:06.329 --> 00:53:09.690
No reason why they both
couldn't hedge themselves

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:13.889
perfectly and in equilibrium
that's exactly what they did.

00:53:13.889 --> 00:53:14.309
Any other...
 

00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.860
Yes?
 

00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:18.608
Student: If the total
endowments in every state hadn't

00:53:18.608 --> 00:53:22.356
all added up to 500 would you
create an expected endowment or

00:53:22.356 --> 00:53:24.730
would you just not do the
problem?

00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:27.219
Prof: So the next step
is going to be--

00:53:27.219 --> 00:53:29.514
what I'm going to do now is I'm
going to assume that the

00:53:29.514 --> 00:53:31.809
endowments don't add up to a
constant in every state.

00:53:31.809 --> 00:53:33.309
Then what's going to happen?
 

00:53:33.309 --> 00:53:35.719
So this is not at all obvious
how to solve this and what to

00:53:35.719 --> 00:53:37.222
do,
but it's going to turn out to

00:53:37.222 --> 00:53:40.958
have a beautiful simple answer,
shocking, not only be simple

00:53:40.958 --> 00:53:42.690
but also surprising.
 

00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:46.128
So before I do that I'm going
to change the endowments so

00:53:46.128 --> 00:53:47.909
they're not all a constant.
 

00:53:47.909 --> 00:53:50.090
Any questions about where we're
going?

00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:50.969
Yeah?
 

00:53:50.969 --> 00:53:53.210
Student: Could you just
repeat what you said about

00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:54.650
hedging
&gt;?

00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:57.050
Prof: Yes.
 

00:53:57.050 --> 00:53:58.610
Thank you for the question.
 

00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:00.969
So I went a little quickly.
 

00:54:00.969 --> 00:54:04.681
I said that what we proved by
solving for the general

00:54:04.681 --> 00:54:09.250
equilibrium is that the price in
every state was just going to be

00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:11.820
1 quarter times the probability.
 

00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:14.420
That's what we showed had to
happen in equilibrium.

00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:16.389
Now, what's the consequence of
that?

00:54:16.389 --> 00:54:18.309
The consequences are twofold.
 

00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:21.539
Number one, the price of all
the assets is the same

00:54:21.539 --> 00:54:25.351
expectation we naively would
have taken before where we used

00:54:25.351 --> 00:54:27.420
the discount rate 1 quarter.
 

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:31.409
That's the first implication.
 

00:54:31.409 --> 00:54:34.688
The second implication is that
from the formula for consumption

00:54:34.688 --> 00:54:38.021
we noticed that she consumes the
same amount in all three states

00:54:38.021 --> 00:54:40.983
because P_s over
gamma_s is 1 quarter

00:54:40.983 --> 00:54:42.360
in all three states.
 

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:44.550
Her consumption is going to be
the same in all three states,

00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:46.949
and his consumption,
which will be different from

00:54:46.949 --> 00:54:49.010
hers,
but his will be the same in all

00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:50.190
three states as well.
 

00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:52.650
The two will add up to 500.
 

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:56.175
So then I took a little bit of
a leap and I interpreted that

00:54:56.175 --> 00:54:59.820
conclusion that her consumption
doesn't depend on the sate.

00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:01.320
What's the interpretation of
that?

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:04.510
She has obviously,
somewhere behind the scenes,

00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:08.710
given up some of her A to get B
and C and held them in a mixture

00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:12.110
so as to get the same
consumption in every state.

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:13.809
What must the mixture be?
 

00:55:13.809 --> 00:55:17.387
Obviously she holds the same
proportion of A,

00:55:17.387 --> 00:55:21.210
B and C because those add up to
500,500, 500.

00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:23.568
So she must have held the same
proportion of A,

00:55:23.568 --> 00:55:26.184
B and C, a fraction of the
market and got a riskless

00:55:26.184 --> 00:55:26.750
payoff.
 

00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:27.980
So she diversified.
 

00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:29.659
She didn't just stick with her
A.

00:55:29.659 --> 00:55:32.614
She substituted a little bit of
A, a little bit of B and a

00:55:32.614 --> 00:55:34.739
little bit of C,
a different boat on every

00:55:34.739 --> 00:55:36.969
ocean, and now she runs no risk
at all.

00:55:36.969 --> 00:55:39.436
So she diversified,
but in the language we used

00:55:39.436 --> 00:55:42.119
last time I could call
diversification hedging if I

00:55:42.119 --> 00:55:42.869
wanted to.
 

00:55:42.869 --> 00:55:45.385
She just, sort of,
sold Arrow securities in the

00:55:45.385 --> 00:55:48.336
right proportions to turn her A
into something that was

00:55:48.336 --> 00:55:49.650
completely riskless.
 

00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:52.476
So whether you call it
diversifying or call it hedging

00:55:52.476 --> 00:55:55.195
she's achieved the same end of
totally balancing her

00:55:55.195 --> 00:55:56.050
consumption.
 

00:55:56.050 --> 00:55:59.846
He did the same thing and they
both could do it because the

00:55:59.846 --> 00:56:02.400
aggregate consumption was a
constant.

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.309
Yes?
 

00:56:03.309 --> 00:56:05.998
Student: What would an
Arrow security actually look

00:56:05.998 --> 00:56:06.329
like?
 

00:56:06.329 --> 00:56:07.090
Prof: In real life?
 

00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:07.789
Student: Yeah.
 

00:56:07.789 --> 00:56:12.494
Prof: The closest we've
come to an Arrow security in

00:56:12.494 --> 00:56:15.746
real life is a CDS,
and this is part of the reason

00:56:15.746 --> 00:56:18.099
why these economists,
Larry Summers,

00:56:18.099 --> 00:56:21.963
my classmate,
and Rubin who was the Secretary

00:56:21.963 --> 00:56:24.684
of the Treasury,
and ran Citi Corp,

00:56:24.684 --> 00:56:27.364
and who was a Yale law school
student and a Harvard

00:56:27.364 --> 00:56:29.563
undergraduate,
and who I've sat on many

00:56:29.563 --> 00:56:32.976
committees with,
they were seduced by the--so

00:56:32.976 --> 00:56:34.219
what's a CDS?
 

00:56:34.219 --> 00:56:40.929
A CDS pays 1 dollar if some
bond defaults by 1 dollar.

00:56:40.929 --> 00:56:44.311
So that isn't an Arrow security
because an Arrow security is a

00:56:44.311 --> 00:56:45.809
much more detailed thing.
 

00:56:45.809 --> 00:56:49.400
An Arrow security says I'll pay
1 dollar in state one.

00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:52.639
An Arrow security says you get
an apple in state 1,

00:56:52.639 --> 00:56:56.086
but state 1,
remember, is not described by a

00:56:56.086 --> 00:56:59.034
single firm,
state 1, the states of nature

00:56:59.034 --> 00:57:02.407
are total descriptions of
everything that could happen in

00:57:02.407 --> 00:57:03.309
the economy.
 

00:57:03.309 --> 00:57:07.056
So an Arrow security really
says if it stops snowing in

00:57:07.056 --> 00:57:10.516
Siberia,
if Khomeini loses power in

00:57:10.516 --> 00:57:17.050
Iran, if there's a favorable
election outcome in Afghanistan,

00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:22.518
and if Obama wins reelection,
and if the U.S.

00:57:22.518 --> 00:57:26.110
solves the energy problem then
I'll give you 1 dollar.

00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:28.856
So the Arrow security lists an
incredible number of contingent

00:57:28.856 --> 00:57:31.333
things, every contingency
possible and says in that case

00:57:31.333 --> 00:57:32.550
I'll give you 1 dollar.
 

00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:35.907
A CDS says if this thing
happens I'll give you 1 dollar

00:57:35.907 --> 00:57:38.268
whether or not Obama wins
election,

00:57:38.268 --> 00:57:40.974
whether or not America
discovers a new source of

00:57:40.974 --> 00:57:43.175
energy,
whether or not Afghanistan

00:57:43.175 --> 00:57:44.050
turns around.
 

00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:46.768
Just so long as the bond
defaults I'll give you 1 dollar.

00:57:46.768 --> 00:57:55.590
So the CDS is an event
contingent security.

00:57:55.590 --> 00:57:58.391
That's the CDS,
and an Arrow security is a much

00:57:58.391 --> 00:58:00.219
more finely specified thing.
 

00:58:00.219 --> 00:58:02.856
It's a state contingent--you
say everything that happens in

00:58:02.856 --> 00:58:04.889
the economy,
so we'll never get to Arrow

00:58:04.889 --> 00:58:07.681
securities,
but CDS looks like we're on the

00:58:07.681 --> 00:58:08.579
way to them.
 

00:58:08.579 --> 00:58:11.740
And these guys blundered by
thinking since CDSs are on the

00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:14.958
way to Arrow securities we
should have as many CDSs and let

00:58:14.958 --> 00:58:17.400
people trade as much of them as
we can,

00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:20.940
but we're going to get to that
in the last lecture about how

00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:23.351
all this theory,
what's wrong with all the

00:58:23.351 --> 00:58:23.760
theory.
 

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:34.041
So, any other questions before
we--so let's now make the change

00:58:34.041 --> 00:58:38.849
that he suggested up there.
 

00:58:38.849 --> 00:58:41.340
Let's now change the economy
just a little bit.

00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:44.230
Let's eliminate C.
 

00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:48.010
So this just disappears.
 

00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:51.340
So obviously now the total
endowment is very contingent.

00:58:51.340 --> 00:59:03.519
It's 200, it's 280 and it's 440.
 

00:59:03.519 --> 00:59:04.679
Now what do we do?
 

00:59:04.679 --> 00:59:10.849
So beta owns B.
 

00:59:10.849 --> 00:59:12.380
So now what's equilibrium going
to be?

00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:14.059
What do you think is going to
happen?

00:59:14.059 --> 00:59:16.159
We want to quantify this.
 

00:59:16.159 --> 00:59:19.193
We want to give a beautiful
simple theory that's

00:59:19.193 --> 00:59:21.708
quantifiable,
but what do you anticipate

00:59:21.708 --> 00:59:24.548
happening to P_1,
P_2 and

00:59:24.548 --> 00:59:25.840
P_3?
 

00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:29.065
So everybody's going to say,
alpha, she's going to say,

00:59:29.065 --> 00:59:30.380
look, my A is risky.
 

00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:32.250
I don't want to hold my risky
thing.

00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:35.121
I want to start hedging and
trading these Arrow securities

00:59:35.121 --> 00:59:37.340
so I get the same constant in
every state.

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:41.047
Of course beta who owns B,
he's going to do the same

00:59:41.047 --> 00:59:41.630
thing.
 

00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:43.487
So they're both going to be
trying to trade Arrow

00:59:43.487 --> 00:59:43.989
securities.
 

00:59:43.989 --> 00:59:49.489
What's going to happen,
do you think?

00:59:49.489 --> 00:59:50.219
Yes?
 

00:59:50.219 --> 00:59:52.463
Student: Aren't they
both just going to be exposed to

00:59:52.463 --> 00:59:54.099
whatever the total risk of the
economy is in

00:59:54.099 --> 00:59:55.239
&gt;?
 

00:59:55.239 --> 00:59:57.519
Prof: Yeah,
there's no way that they can,

00:59:57.519 --> 01:00:00.286
exactly, there's no way that
each of them can be perfectly

01:00:00.286 --> 01:00:00.820
hedged.
 

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:04.045
So no matter what they do,
they're going to be exposed to

01:00:04.045 --> 01:00:06.809
more risk in state,
you know, state 3 is going to

01:00:06.809 --> 01:00:08.018
be a great state.
 

01:00:08.018 --> 01:00:10.614
State 1 is going to be a
terrible state,

01:00:10.614 --> 01:00:14.010
so what do you think that means
about the prices?

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:17.637
Everybody can't be hedged,
and so in fact what'll happen

01:00:17.637 --> 01:00:19.420
is nobody will be hedged.
 

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:23.510
Although, alpha will be,
who hates risk more than beta,

01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:26.920
will be closer to hedged than
beta will be.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:30.320
So beta will end up bearing
more of the risk than alpha.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:34.414
And what do you think will
happen to the prices of the

01:00:34.414 --> 01:00:38.199
Arrow securities relative to the
probabilities?

01:00:38.199 --> 01:00:39.199
Yes?
 

01:00:39.199 --> 01:00:40.070
Student: It won't be
constant.

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:43.255
Prof: There won't be a
constant ratio of 1 quarter as

01:00:43.255 --> 01:00:45.739
we had before,
but can you be more specific?

01:00:45.739 --> 01:00:51.353
Student: The price of
the securities for state 1 will

01:00:51.353 --> 01:00:56.585
be greater relative to the
probability than the price of

01:00:56.585 --> 01:00:59.250
the security in state 3.
 

01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:00.099
Prof: Exactly.
 

01:01:00.099 --> 01:01:02.929
So that's what's going to turn
out.

01:01:02.929 --> 01:01:05.273
The world is short of
commodities in state 1,

01:01:05.273 --> 01:01:06.980
there just aren't many apples.
 

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:08.010
That's the disaster.
 

01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:10.630
That's when we can't solve the
energy crisis.

01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:14.010
We're totally screwed.
 

01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:17.309
Everybody wants to consume more
in that state.

01:01:17.309 --> 01:01:19.389
Everyone's going to try and
hedge against that state.

01:01:19.389 --> 01:01:22.543
They're all going to be trying
to buy Arrow securities in that

01:01:22.543 --> 01:01:24.164
state,
which means that because there

01:01:24.164 --> 01:01:26.090
aren't as many to buy,
there's just not enough apples

01:01:26.090 --> 01:01:29.335
to go around,
the price of Arrow securities

01:01:29.335 --> 01:01:34.260
in state 1 is going to be high
relative to state 3.

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:35.989
There's plenty to go around
there.

01:01:35.989 --> 01:01:40.123
So she is going to sell some of
her A and get some B to

01:01:40.123 --> 01:01:42.858
diversify,
but B's got so good in state 3

01:01:42.858 --> 01:01:46.219
that all of a sudden she's not
going to be so worried about

01:01:46.219 --> 01:01:48.681
state 3 anymore,
but state 1 she's still going

01:01:48.681 --> 01:01:50.961
to be worried about,
and there's nothing to be done

01:01:50.961 --> 01:01:51.480
about that.
 

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:54.639
So the price is going to have
to be very expensive in state 1.

01:01:54.639 --> 01:01:56.159
So all right,
that's all blah,

01:01:56.159 --> 01:01:56.840
blah, blah.
 

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:59.570
Let's solve for equilibrium and
see what happens.

01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:00.969
We can solve immediately.
 

01:02:00.969 --> 01:02:02.409
Nothing's changed.
 

01:02:02.409 --> 01:02:04.489
The utility functions are the
same.

01:02:04.489 --> 01:02:07.851
None of this changed,
so this board doesn't change at

01:02:07.851 --> 01:02:08.239
all.
 

01:02:08.239 --> 01:02:09.530
That's demand.
 

01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:11.695
Still depends on P_0,
P_1,

01:02:11.695 --> 01:02:13.186
P_2 and
P_3,

01:02:13.186 --> 01:02:16.219
but now we have to be a little
bit more careful in state 1.

01:02:16.219 --> 01:02:19.690
So demand in every state is 600
- 400 P_1 over

01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:23.161
gamma_1 equals
endowment of alpha endowment of

01:02:23.161 --> 01:02:23.730
beta.
 

01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:27.333
So in state 1,
I'm going to now change this to

01:02:27.333 --> 01:02:31.976
a 1 although with my handwriting
it looked like a 1 anyway,

01:02:31.976 --> 01:02:35.659
what's the aggregate endowment
in state 1?

01:02:35.659 --> 01:02:39.460
The aggregate endowment in
state 1 is 200.

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:41.550
This is a 1 now.
 

01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:48.295
That's 200, so that means
P_1 over

01:02:48.295 --> 01:02:53.159
gamma_1 = 1,
right?

01:02:53.159 --> 01:02:56.710
Because 400 and 400 so it's 1.
 

01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:59.219
So you're not discounting the
first state at all.

01:02:59.219 --> 01:03:01.239
You're looking at the
probability of it.

01:03:01.239 --> 01:03:02.978
But what if I go to
P_2 over

01:03:02.978 --> 01:03:03.920
gamma_2?
 

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:06.030
Well, the demand is going to be
the same.

01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:11.547
It's the price that's going to
change to make up for the fact

01:03:11.547 --> 01:03:15.318
that the supply is much
different, namely,

01:03:15.318 --> 01:03:17.250
namely what,
280.

01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:22.394
So now if I subtract I get
400,280 minus that is 320

01:03:22.394 --> 01:03:27.440
divided by 400 which looks like
4 fifths, maybe.

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:34.050
320 over 400 is 4 fifths, right?
 

01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:36.762
Because 320 divided by 400 is 4
fifths, so P_2 over

01:03:36.762 --> 01:03:38.210
gamma_2 is 4 fifths.
 

01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:40.340
So they're not proportional
anymore.

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:50.077
And then P_3 over
gamma_3 equals--now

01:03:50.077 --> 01:03:58.597
the outcome is 440,
so if I subtract 440 from this

01:03:58.597 --> 01:04:05.900
I get 160 divided by 400,
what's that?

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:06.570
Student: 2 fifths.
 

01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:07.989
Prof: 2 fifths,
thank you.

01:04:07.989 --> 01:04:14.980
P_3 over
gamma_3 = 2 fifths.

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:19.440
So the prices turned out to be
quite different.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.648
Now, the reason why they're
slightly higher on average,

01:04:22.648 --> 01:04:25.916
of course, than they were
before is because there's less

01:04:25.916 --> 01:04:27.699
consumption in the future.
 

01:04:27.699 --> 01:04:30.590
We've suddenly made our future
much worse off.

01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:33.001
So people are more desperate to
consume in the future,

01:04:33.001 --> 01:04:35.641
so that means the prices of
future consumption are going to

01:04:35.641 --> 01:04:36.280
be higher.
 

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.710
So we have two effects here.
 

01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:40.670
These prices instead of being 1
quarter everywhere are higher,

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:43.483
much higher than 1 quarter
because the future looks so much

01:04:43.483 --> 01:04:43.969
worse.
 

01:04:43.969 --> 01:04:47.070
The interest rate is going to
go down.

01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:49.079
It's not going to be 300
percent anymore.

01:04:49.079 --> 01:04:52.766
But more interesting is that
the prices are no longer

01:04:52.766 --> 01:04:55.320
proportional to the
probabilities.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:59.443
Just as he said over there the
price in state 1 is going to be

01:04:59.443 --> 01:05:02.349
much higher relative to the
probability,

01:05:02.349 --> 01:05:06.909
namely 100 percent of it,
than the price in state 3 which

01:05:06.909 --> 01:05:09.110
is only 40 percent of it.
 

01:05:09.110 --> 01:05:12.309
So that's the conclusion.
 

01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:14.280
So now what do we do for our
price?

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.860
What's the price of A?
 

01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:20.449
What's the price of A?
 

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:22.179
What do I plug in here?
 

01:05:22.179 --> 01:05:33.771
That, so that equals 1 quarter
times 50 4 fifths times 1

01:05:33.771 --> 01:05:41.161
quarter--
1 fifth times 100 P_3

01:05:41.161 --> 01:05:49.998
was 2 fifths times 1 half 1
fifth times 75 which equals

01:05:49.998 --> 01:05:56.233
something,
20,35 and 12 and 1 half,

01:05:56.233 --> 01:05:58.699
47 and 1 half.
 

01:05:58.699 --> 01:06:00.710
Student: Why would you
&gt;?

01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:01.760
Prof: Why did I what?
 

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.550
Student: Why would you
&gt;?

01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:05.570
Prof: So what is
P_1?

01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:09.139
P_1 is equal to
gamma_1 and

01:06:09.139 --> 01:06:11.699
gamma_1 is 1 quarter.
 

01:06:11.699 --> 01:06:12.969
So that's how I got 1 quarter
here.

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:16.780
So that's 1 times 1 quarter.
 

01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:20.980
P_2 was 3 fifths.
 

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:21.750
What was P_2?
 

01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:23.550
Maybe I did it wrong anyway.
 

01:06:23.550 --> 01:06:29.346
P_2 was 4 fifths
times 1 quarter which is equal

01:06:29.346 --> 01:06:35.556
to 1 fifth, and P_3
was 2 fifths times 1 half which

01:06:35.556 --> 01:06:38.039
is equal to 1 fifth.
 

01:06:38.039 --> 01:06:39.809
So that's how I got the prices.
 

01:06:39.809 --> 01:06:43.150
So all right,
so you see that things changed,

01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:46.336
and we've captured the idea
that people can't hedge fully by

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:49.579
making the price of the Arrow
security in the state where the

01:06:49.579 --> 01:06:53.271
economy's worse off,
much smaller than it was

01:06:53.271 --> 01:06:56.402
before, I mean,
much higher than it was

01:06:56.402 --> 01:06:59.030
relative to the probability than
before.

01:06:59.030 --> 01:07:03.590
So we haven't gotten close to
the punch line,

01:07:03.590 --> 01:07:04.420
sorry.
 

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:05.610
Yes?
 

01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:08.786
Student: Can you repeat
the part where you said stuff

01:07:08.786 --> 01:07:11.858
about the future looks so much
worse they need to increase

01:07:11.858 --> 01:07:12.719
consumption?
 

01:07:12.719 --> 01:07:16.679
Prof: Two things
happened to the prices compared

01:07:16.679 --> 01:07:17.559
to before.
 

01:07:17.559 --> 01:07:20.452
One is that we no longer have
the prices proportional to the

01:07:20.452 --> 01:07:21.579
probabilities,
right?

01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:24.902
Their proportion is 1,4 fifths,
2 fifths instead of the same

01:07:24.902 --> 01:07:28.000
constant 1 quarter everywhere,
and that's because of the

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.239
relative scarcity.
 

01:07:29.239 --> 01:07:31.768
People are much more worried
about the first state than the

01:07:31.768 --> 01:07:34.907
fourth state and that's why,
relative to the probability,

01:07:34.907 --> 01:07:37.909
the price is much higher than
the third state.

01:07:37.909 --> 01:07:39.280
You agree with that, right?
 

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.480
Student: Yes.
 

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.320
Prof: But there's a
second effect which is that all

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.001
these numbers,
1,4 fifths, and 2 fifths

01:07:44.001 --> 01:07:45.699
they're bigger than the 1
quarter,

01:07:45.699 --> 01:07:47.349
1 quarter, 1 quarter we had
before,

01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:48.349
but that's obvious.
 

01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:50.900
That's because we wiped out the
future.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.893
Half the endowment in the
future disappeared,

01:07:52.893 --> 01:07:55.474
so naturally people are willing
to pay more for the future

01:07:55.474 --> 01:07:56.969
because they're poorer there.
 

01:07:56.969 --> 01:08:00.139
In the first day of class we
said that the interest rate,

01:08:00.139 --> 01:08:03.690
or the third week,
the interest rate according to

01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:07.760
Fisher would go down if you got
poorer in the future.

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.250
So that's part of the reason
that's happened.

01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:11.449
By the way, what is the
riskless rate of interest?

01:08:11.449 --> 01:08:17.500
So P_1 P_2
P_3 equals what now?

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:24.345
It's equal to 1 quarter 1 fifth
1 fifth, so 1 quarter 1 fifth 1

01:08:24.345 --> 01:08:25.229
fifth.
 

01:08:25.229 --> 01:08:31.298
These are the prices,
1 quarter 1 fifth 1 fifth and

01:08:31.298 --> 01:08:36.692
that's equal to 20,
10,14 over 20,

01:08:36.692 --> 01:08:43.605
so that's 7 over 10,
so therefore the interest rate

01:08:43.605 --> 01:08:47.912
1 r = 10 over 7 so r = 3
sevenths which is like 40

01:08:47.912 --> 01:08:48.880
percent.
 

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:52.189
So the interest rate went from
300 percent to 40 percent,

01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:55.560
but that's because we lost all
this future consumption.

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.328
But that's not what I'm
concentrating on.

01:08:57.328 --> 01:08:59.250
Fisher would have already known
that.

01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:02.360
What I'm concentrating on is
the fact that the prices are no

01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.630
longer proportional to the
probabilities.

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:07.067
You're discounting every
probability, but adjusting the

01:09:07.067 --> 01:09:09.640
probability because people are
much more worried about the

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.310
first state than the third
state.

01:09:11.310 --> 01:09:15.380
Student: So people are
much more worried about A?

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:17.222
Prof: Not A,
they're more worried about the

01:09:17.222 --> 01:09:17.750
first state.
 

01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:19.899
The firms are A and B.
 

01:09:19.899 --> 01:09:22.622
The states are 1,2 and 3,
so they're much more worried

01:09:22.622 --> 01:09:25.140
about the first state where the
payoff is 200,

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:27.430
than they are about the third
state where the payoff,

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:34.550
total dividends in the economy
are 440.

01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:35.390
Are you with me?
 

01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:37.470
Student: Yeah.
 

01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:38.960
Prof: Oh boy.
 

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.510
That sounded so unconvincing.
 

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:42.529
I want to say the punch line.
 

01:09:42.529 --> 01:09:43.930
So I've got three more minutes
to go.

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:45.109
There are two punch lines.
 

01:09:45.109 --> 01:09:48.158
I haven't gotten to the
stunning conclusion.

01:09:48.158 --> 01:09:52.908
So far I've said stuff which
Arrow and Debreu had already

01:09:52.908 --> 01:09:55.502
figured out,
but now I want to go to the

01:09:55.502 --> 01:09:57.710
thing that Tobin and Markowitz
figured out,

01:09:57.710 --> 01:10:00.868
which is one more step we
haven't noticed yet.

01:10:00.868 --> 01:10:04.802
Arrow has already figured out
that because not everybody could

01:10:04.802 --> 01:10:08.542
hedge that means that the price
of an Arrow security is not

01:10:08.542 --> 01:10:10.930
exactly equal to the
probability.

01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:14.672
It's relatively high if the
economy's poor like in state 1

01:10:14.672 --> 01:10:18.680
and relatively lower if the
economy's rich like in state 3.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:20.479
That's common sense.
 

01:10:20.479 --> 01:10:23.735
Now, what's not common sense is
the extraordinary conclusion I'm

01:10:23.735 --> 01:10:24.770
about to show you.
 

01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:26.939
Let's look at what the
consumption is;

01:10:26.939 --> 01:10:37.050
the final consumption of these
two people.

01:10:37.050 --> 01:10:40.692
So if we look at the final
consumption of these two people,

01:10:40.692 --> 01:10:43.770
what's her final consumption,
so X_A.

01:10:43.770 --> 01:10:50.460
In the three states it's 200 -
100 times 1 which is 100.

01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:51.890
What is it in the second state?
 

01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:59.152
It's 200 - 100 times--what was
P_s over--times 4

01:10:59.152 --> 01:11:03.738
fifths which is,
help, 160, maybe.

01:11:03.738 --> 01:11:10.430
And the last step was 200 - 100
times 2 fifths.

01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:14.199
2 fifths is 20 so this is 180.
 

01:11:14.199 --> 01:11:15.250
That's hers.
 

01:11:15.250 --> 01:11:17.729
And his consumption in the
future--

01:11:17.729 --> 01:11:19.386
I'll put a tilde,
I haven't talked about

01:11:19.386 --> 01:11:26.025
X_0 yet--
is 400 - 300 times 1 which

01:11:26.025 --> 01:11:32.417
equals 100,
and here's it's 400 - 300 times

01:11:32.417 --> 01:11:36.470
4 fifths which is equal to,
help!

01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:49.703
4 fifths of 300 is 160,
and here it's 400 - 300 times 2

01:11:49.703 --> 01:11:57.300
fifths which is equal to 280.
 

01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:58.539
Is this right?
 

01:11:58.539 --> 01:12:02.100
100,160, who told me it was 160?
 

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:04.779
Yes and what's that?
 

01:12:04.779 --> 01:12:05.970
2 fifths is 120.
 

01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:07.170
This is 280.
 

01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:10.871
Student: The number
&gt;

01:12:10.871 --> 01:12:14.210
, like 200 - 100 times 4 fifths
is like 120.

01:12:14.210 --> 01:12:15.118
Prof: What?
 

01:12:15.118 --> 01:12:17.420
Student: The first
&gt;

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:18.939
Prof: Which mistake is
there here?

01:12:18.939 --> 01:12:20.280
Student: No,
the second

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:21.529
&gt;
 

01:12:21.529 --> 01:12:23.510
Student: The second 120
&gt;

01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:24.840
Prof: Is this the wrong
one?

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:25.189
Student: The wrong one.
 

01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:26.510
Student: 160 should be
120.

01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:28.359
Prof: Here.
 

01:12:28.359 --> 01:12:30.939
200 - 80 is 120.
 

01:12:30.939 --> 01:12:32.489
Thank you.
 

01:12:32.489 --> 01:12:35.060
So these are all right now?
 

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:38.229
Student: 180 should be
&gt;

01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:41.969
Prof: 180 should be,
okay, this is 40 so this should

01:12:41.969 --> 01:12:42.550
be 160.
 

01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:44.380
Thank you.
 

01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:46.050
That's it, great.
 

01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:48.159
So now what's so shocking about
those numbers?

01:12:48.159 --> 01:12:49.420
That I finally got them right?
 

01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:50.350
Thank you.
 

01:12:50.350 --> 01:12:55.405
What's shocking is this
consumption is just the sum of

01:12:55.405 --> 01:13:00.939
the aggregate endowment--what's
the aggregate endowment?

01:13:00.939 --> 01:13:11.729
Remember the aggregate
endowment is just 200,280 and

01:13:11.729 --> 01:13:13.000
440.
 

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.319
So let's say you take 1 quarter
of this.

01:13:18.319 --> 01:13:19.368
Let's take 1 quarter of that.
 

01:13:19.368 --> 01:13:26.368
That's 50,70--that's 50,70 and
110.

01:13:26.368 --> 01:13:30.501
So 1 quarter of this plus if
you add to that 150 you're going

01:13:30.501 --> 01:13:32.359
to get all these numbers.
 

01:13:32.359 --> 01:13:35.627
So this person,
alpha, A, I claim,

01:13:35.627 --> 01:13:41.567
just holds 50 of the riskless
bond, pays 50,50 plus 50,70 and

01:13:41.567 --> 01:13:42.359
110.
 

01:13:42.359 --> 01:13:46.609
No.
 

01:13:46.609 --> 01:13:53.600
Is this the right--let's just
check the numbers.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.738
Sorry, only one more second.
 

01:13:55.738 --> 01:14:03.154
I should have--so 100,120 and
160, that's the right number and

01:14:03.154 --> 01:14:10.689
that's equal to 50 of the bond
plus 1 quarter of this thing.

01:14:10.689 --> 01:14:15.440
So 50 50 is--1 quarter of this
is 50,70 and 110,

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.250
right?
 

01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:19.507
So if you hold 50 of the bond
plus 1 quarter of this you get

01:14:19.507 --> 01:14:19.840
100.
 

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.079
50 of the bond plus 70 is 120.
 

01:14:22.079 --> 01:14:25.439
50 of the bond plus 110 is 160.
 

01:14:25.439 --> 01:14:30.520
And this guy is going to hold 3
quarters of the aggregate

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:34.060
endowment plus minus 50 of the
bond,

01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:38.420
so 3 quarters of the aggregate
endowment,

01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:42.404
3 quarters of this thing,
3 quarters of the aggregate

01:14:42.404 --> 01:14:44.779
endowment is 150 - 50 is 100.
 

01:14:44.779 --> 01:14:48.050
3 quarters of this is 210 - 50
is 160.

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:51.649
3 quarters of that,
is 330 - 50 is 280.

01:14:51.649 --> 01:14:55.220
So what they've done in
equilibrium is everybody,

01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:58.238
despite having a million stocks
to choose from and thousands of

01:14:58.238 --> 01:15:01.311
states and all that stuff,
what everybody does is hold the

01:15:01.311 --> 01:15:04.050
riskless bond,
puts money in the bank and

01:15:04.050 --> 01:15:06.220
holds the whole stock market.
 

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:14.125
So the first theorem we're
going to prove next time is

01:15:14.125 --> 01:15:22.030
called The Mutual Fund Theorem
which is that everybody

01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:29.488
diversifies by holding the
aggregate economy,

01:15:29.488 --> 01:15:36.920
all stocks in the same
proportion, plus money in bank.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.434
So that theorem of Shakespeare
of diversifying,

01:15:39.434 --> 01:15:40.909
what did it amount to do?
 

01:15:40.909 --> 01:15:42.569
We have a very concrete thing.
 

01:15:42.569 --> 01:15:44.649
You hold 10 percent.
 

01:15:44.649 --> 01:15:48.404
This person's holding 25
percent of every stock in the

01:15:48.404 --> 01:15:52.939
whole economy plus putting some
money, 50 dollars in the bank.

01:15:52.939 --> 01:15:55.903
The other person is doing 3
quarters of every stock in the

01:15:55.903 --> 01:15:58.970
whole economy plus lending the
money to the first person.

01:15:58.970 --> 01:16:02.164
So that's the first of the two
amazing results and I'll start

01:16:02.164 --> 01:16:03.710
next time by explaining it.
 

01:16:03.710 --> 01:16:11.000

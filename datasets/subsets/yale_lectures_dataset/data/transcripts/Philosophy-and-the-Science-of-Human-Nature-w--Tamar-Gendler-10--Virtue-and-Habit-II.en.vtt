00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.030
So today I'm going to give you
your money's worth in the

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.990
sense that some of you might
be taking this class to see

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.680
whether you would want to take
another philosophy class at

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.980
some point in the future.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.710
And though a lot of what we've
been doing in this class is

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.240
typical of what one would do in
a philosophy class, one of

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.760
the things of which we haven't
done that much is close

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.050
reading of extended passages
from texts.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.076
And so what I want to do today
is to read through as a

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:37.090
group--which means I talk
and you listen, so it's

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.220
not really a group.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.420
But read through with you all
out there smiling back at me,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.620
one section of Aristotle's
Ethics, in particular Book two

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.000
Chapter four, to try to situate
for you the two

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.380
responses that we read for today
that both exemplify the

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.660
theme of the course.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.590
So roughly the first quarter
to third of lecture will be

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.790
going through this passage
from Aristotle.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.950
I'll put the text up for you and
I'll talk you through it.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.320
And then what I want to do is to
bring out to you how it is

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.600
that the two articles we read
for today pick up on very

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.320
specific and very precise
portions of the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.850
Aristotelian text.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.360
So as I said, we're going
to be looking closely at

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.920
something in the book that
we've been reading from

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.750
Aristotle, The Nicomachean
Ethics.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.520
In particular, we have heard
many times recitation of

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.096
Aristotle's claim that virtues
of character are acquired

00:01:42.096 --> 00:01:43.870
through habituation.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.000
That just as one becomes a
player of the harp by playing

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.230
the harp, so too one becomes
just by acting as the just one

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.500
does, brave by acting like
the brave one does.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.820
But Aristotle himself realizes
that this cannot be the full

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.710
story and he begins his
discussion in Book two Chapter

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.150
four something that we've read
twice already in this

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.320
class--once a few weeks ago
and reread for Tuesday.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.000
Aristotle remarks that someone
might be puzzled by what we

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.870
mean by saying that we become
just by doing just actions and

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.090
temperate by doing temperate
actions.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.980
For one might suppose that if
we do just or temperate

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.315
actions we are thereby,
just or temperate.

00:02:32.315 --> 00:02:38.050
Aristotle wants to correct a
possible misconception of what

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.760
it is that he's claiming.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.725
In particular, he wants to point
out that although it is

00:02:44.725 --> 00:02:50.580
a necessary condition on being
just and temperate that one do

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.280
just and temperate
actions, it's not

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.000
a sufficient condition.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.650
That is, although it's a
requirement to be just and

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.680
temperate that you have to act
in the way that the just or

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.300
temperate person does, it's
not enough to do that.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.850
You need some other things
in addition.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.240
And what we're doing today is
refining the understanding

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.630
that we've gotten already.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.110
We knew already from the
previous readings and lectures

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.520
that Aristotle says: in order to
be just you have to act as

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.120
the just one does and habituate
yourself to that

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.430
sort of action.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.510
And now he's going to give us
some additional conditions on

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.480
justice, temperance and
the other virtues.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.340
So he says, "for actions to be
done temperately or justly, it

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.880
does not suffice that
they themselves

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.155
have the right qualities.

00:03:51.155 --> 00:03:56.899
Rather the agent must also be
in the right state when he

00:03:56.899 --> 00:04:02.690
does them." Now what could
Aristotle mean by that?

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.570
What does he mean by saying
for an action to be done

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.930
justly, it does not suffice,
it's not sufficient, for the

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.730
action to have the
right qualities.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.960
In addition, the agent has
to be in the right state

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.160
when he does it?

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.930
Well suppose I act in a
temperate fashion simply

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.610
because the resources required
for me to act in an

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.750
intemperate fashion
aren't available.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.720
Suppose the reason that I
refrain from drinking the

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.080
chocolate milk that's typically
in my fridge is

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.880
because there's no chocolate
milk in my

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.970
fridge for me to drink.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.720
Suppose the reason that I
refrain from going to a party

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.820
on Saturday night is because
there are no parties available

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.970
for me to go to.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.590
I have in that case, says
Aristotle, acted as the

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.060
temperate person would.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.050
But I haven't done so as
the result of being

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.770
in the right state.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.940
Or I might, intending to give an
object to somebody to whom

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.820
it doesn't belong, mistakenly
return it to

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.000
its rightful owner.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.750
If I do that, I return the
object to its rightful owner.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.580
I act as the just
person would.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.670
But I don't do so for
the right reason.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.990
Aristotle wants to say that if
you're temperate only because

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.940
you don't have the opportunity
to act in an intemperate way,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.420
but that if you had that
opportunity you would, and

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.600
that if you act as the just
person would not because

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.840
you're aiming to be just, but
only because you've got faulty

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:58.090
information, your activity
doesn't count as an instance

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.600
of the virtue with which
he is concerned.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.770
In particular, Aristotle says
that there are three

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.840
conditions that you need to
satisfy for your just act to

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.670
count as a virtuously just act
or your temperate act to count

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.800
as a temperate act and so on.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.290
First, you need to do the action
knowing that you're

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.520
doing something virtuous.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:32.120
Second, you need to decide to do
the action exactly because

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.450
doing so is virtuous.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:42.710
And third, you need to do so
from what he calls a "firm and

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:49.820
unchanging state." So the first
condition is that the

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.030
reason that you be in a
situation where you know what

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.442
act is the virtuous one.

00:06:57.442 --> 00:07:03.440
The second is, you choose it
because it's the virtuous one.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.040
And the third is that your
choice isn't a one off thing

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.090
which is happening in this
situation, but not in others.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:17.110
But rather that your choice is
expressive of, indicative of,

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.630
arising from a state of
character that you have that

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.170
persists over time.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:28.064
And I'll give some examples
in a minute.

00:07:28.064 --> 00:07:32.860
Aristotle says in summation that
"actions are called just

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.370
or temperate when they are the
sort that a just or temperate

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:42.980
person would do" where the just
or temperate person is

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.730
not the one who merely does the
actions, but the one who

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:52.280
does them "in the way that the
just or temperate person does

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.670
them."

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:58.360
So the question that that leaves
us with is this: what

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.620
is the way that a just or
temperate or brave or

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:07.580
otherwise virtuous person
does those acts?

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.885
So let's run through it with the
example of bravery, how it

00:08:11.885 --> 00:08:16.620
is that we might satisfy the
three Aristotelian conditions?

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.059
The first condition you recall
is that you have to do the

00:08:19.059 --> 00:08:21.080
action knowingly.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.710
So suppose I'm out there on
the battlefield and I know

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.380
that there are two groups
of soldiers--

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.410
the brave ones and the
cowardly ones.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:34.790
And I am totally clear that I
have no interest whatsoever in

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.520
risking my life.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.020
So I make the decision that my
plan is to do whatever the

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.440
cowardly soldiers do.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.060
And I set myself up in such a
way that I put myself in the

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.650
middle of a group of people
whom I take to be cowardly

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.440
soldiers and I follow along
with what it is

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.390
that they're doing.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:59.710
If it turns out that I have
mistakenly selected a group of

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:03.200
brave soldiers to imitate
rather than a group of

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:09.470
cowardly soldiers to imitate, I
will perform a behavior that

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:14.150
is the same behavior that the
brave person would, but I

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:18.820
won't perform it in the way
that the brave person did.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:24.886
I thought that I was imitating
the cowardly soldiers, but

00:09:24.886 --> 00:09:27.330
because I was mistaken about
who the brave ones were and

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:33.520
who the cowardly ones were, I
mistakenly imitated an action

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:40.690
that turned out to be brave.
Aristotle says: No credit.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.690
No credit for virtuous action.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:49.640
The second requirement is that
in addition to knowing which

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.170
action is the virtuous one and
which is the non-virtuous one,

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.400
I have to decide to
perform the action

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.100
because it's virtuous.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.360
So suppose now I'm in
a similar situation.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.890
I'm out on the battlefield.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.880
I know which group is the
cowardly group and I know

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:11.730
which group is the brave group
and I decide because I want to

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:16.080
get a good reputation that
I will do as the

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.160
brave soldiers do.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:25.100
So I'm knowingly performing an
act that is brave, but I'm not

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:30.890
performing the act that is brave
because it is brave,

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:35.710
because in so doing I will
express a virtue, because in

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:40.840
so doing I will bring to
fruition this ideal state that

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.370
Aristotle has emphasized
the importance of.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:47.270
I'm doing it because I'm
interested in getting a medal.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.950
I'm doing it because I'm
interested in getting a good

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.390
reputation.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:55.690
Aristotle says, even if I do the
right thing, even if I do

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:59.290
the right thing knowingly,
if I do it with the wrong

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:01.150
motivation in mind.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.650
No credit.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:10.622
Third, Aristotle says that in
order for an action to count

00:11:10.622 --> 00:11:14.930
as an expression of virtue,
I not only have to do it

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:19.760
knowingly and for the right
reason, I have to do it in

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.820
such a way that it expresses a
characterological feature of

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:29.680
mine that extends over time.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:36.080
So suppose that I just this once
decide to act brave for

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:41.390
the sake of being brave, even
though usually I tend to act

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.360
in a cowardly way.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.670
Aristotle says even if I do it
knowingly, even if I do it

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.120
under the description brave act,
which I'm doing for its

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.820
own sake, if in so doing I don't
express a continuous

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:02.030
feature of my character that
leads me to do this typically

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:08.240
in circumstances requiring
bravery, no credit.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:15.400
And in fact, Aristotle imposes
a fourth condition as well.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.860
And that's fourth condition is
articulated in the opening

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.960
paragraph of Book two
Chapter three.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.760
And it reads as follows, "We
must take someone's pleasure

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.860
or pain following on
his actions to be

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.930
a sign of his state.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.530
If someone who abstains from
bodily pleasures enjoys the

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.240
abstinence, he is temperate.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.710
If he's grieved, he
is intemperate.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.320
If he stands firm against
terrifying situations and does

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.560
not find it painful, he is
brave. But if he finds it

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.480
painful he is cowardly."

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.885
So let's go back to our list.
In order for an action to

00:12:57.885 --> 00:13:00.960
count as virtuous on Aristotle's
picture, you have

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.630
to do it knowing that it's
the virtuous act.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.120
You have to do it because
it's the virtuous

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.510
act for its own sake.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:11.870
You have to do it as an
expression or result of a

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:16.500
standing character feature that
you have. And you have to

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.560
do it with enjoyment.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.160
You have to do it in such a way
that it doesn't feel to

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.660
you like it's an imposition
to act that way.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.520
The brave person on Aristotle's
view is the person

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:36.450
who knowingly, for the sake of
being brave regularly, and

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:43.120
with pleasure acts as the
brave person does.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:48.670
Now next Thursday, we will start
looking at an ethical

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:53.720
theory which challenges
one and two.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.000
We're going to look at
an ethical theory,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.040
consequentialism.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.480
A particular version of it,
utilitarianism which says that

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:07.610
the moral worth of an act
doesn't depend in any way on

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:13.988
the knowledge or intentions of
the person performing the act.

00:14:13.988 --> 00:14:19.680
The texts we read for today
consider respectively the

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.820
fourth and third condition.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:30.790
So the text that we read from
Julia Annas asks the question,

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:38.200
what does it mean to satisfy
Aristotle's fourth condition?

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.440
What does it mean?

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.630
What does it feel like to be
an individual for whom the

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:49.020
performance of acts in
accordance with virtue is

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:53.590
something that one does
with enjoyment?

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:57.060
And the other text that we read
for today--the John Doris

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:03.920
text--calls into question
whether the idea that in order

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.270
for an act to be virtuous it
has to come from a firm and

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:13.850
unchanging state, presupposes
something faulty about human

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.810
psychology.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:19.812
So the two texts that we're
reading for today actually

00:15:19.812 --> 00:15:25.690
come straight out of a careful
understanding of what's going

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:30.370
on in Book two Chapter four
of The Nicomachean Ethics.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.920
So I'm going to turn now to
those texts, but before I do

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.650
so I'm going to check that
everybody's clear on where we

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:42.410
got these four requirements on
what it is that they add to

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:45.350
the initial idea that we become
brave by doing brave

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.490
acts, just by doing just
acts, temperate by

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.120
doing temperate ones.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.655
And that people are clear
how that came out of the

00:15:52.655 --> 00:15:55.212
Aristotelian text that
we're looking at.

00:15:57.924 --> 00:15:59.900
So questions before
we move on?

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:08.280
All right, so the paper that we
read by Julia Annas, who is

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:13.310
a scholar of ancient philosophy,
asks the following

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:19.470
question: what would it be like
to be an Aristotelian

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.510
good person?

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:24.670
That is, what is what's
sometimes called the

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:29.600
phenomenology--the what it feels
like from the inside--of

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.220
Aristotelian virtue?

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.072
Aristotle's told us that the
brave person is the one who

00:16:35.072 --> 00:16:40.270
acts brave without feeling pain
at the bravery, who finds

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:44.380
it natural and pleasurable
to act as the

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.819
virtuous person does.

00:16:47.819 --> 00:16:51.599
Annas' question is what
does that feel

00:16:51.599 --> 00:16:55.455
like from the inside?

00:16:55.455 --> 00:17:00.240
And her answer is now what it
feels like from the inside is

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.730
the kind of internal harmony
that we've been talking about

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:08.470
in many of the lectures in
this unit of the course.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.350
"Exercising virtue is something
that in the virtuous

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:15.570
person involves a harmony of
feelings and deliberations,

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:21.180
rather than a feeling of
overcoming inclinations."

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:26.620
It is to be in a state
of internal harmony.

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:31.880
One's reflective commitments,
one's instincts, one's

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.660
apprehension of the world around
one, the patterns of

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:39.450
attention that one has to the
environment, all of those

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:44.840
comes together in such a way
that it doesn't even feel like

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.910
one is contemplating an
alternate possibility.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.990
The brave person on the
Aristotelian picture doesn't

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.770
stand on the battlefield and
think, huh, I wonder what the

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.090
brave person should
do and what the

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.990
cowardly one should do.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.620
Oh, that cowardly thing
is so tempting, but I

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.510
guess I'll avoid it.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:09.730
The brave person stands on the
battlefield and--like the

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.980
person who has turned a
normative law into a

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:17.780
descriptive one from last
class--feels as if there's

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:24.190
nothing else to be done
then the brave action.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:27.550
On the Aristotelian picture,
the just person, when faced

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:30.410
with the possibility of giving
back the right amount of

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.050
change or the wrong amount of
change in the transaction,

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:37.850
doesn't think to himself, hm,
I wonder if whether I ripped

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.970
off my partner I would
get caught.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.020
Hm, I guess I wouldn't.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.000
I suppose I'll do
the right thing.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.010
The virtuous person on the
Aristotelian picture doesn't

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:54.640
even contemplate the alternative
activity.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.640
And consequently, feels no
need to overcome the

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.090
alternative temptation.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:04.530
There's not a feeling
of resisting a pull

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.490
in the other direction.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:09.780
There's a feeling that the world
presents itself to you

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:17.520
with what is to be done, and
that you go on to do that.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.140
Just as when you go over to
your friend's for dinner,

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:25.420
there is I take it, no thought
on your part what beautiful

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:29.470
silver candlesticks: should I
bring them home with me or

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:32.544
should I leave them here?

00:19:32.544 --> 00:19:38.170
So too for the Aristotelian
virtuous one is that feeling

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:40.290
with respect to anything
that we might think

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:43.412
of as a moral dilemma.

00:19:43.412 --> 00:19:47.870
Now Aristotle also has quite a
bit to say about what it's

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:51.020
like to be in a state where
these feelings come apart,

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.450
where they pull in different
directions.

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:56.080
And the selections that we're
going to read from Aristotle

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.890
for next Tuesday discuss
exactly that question.

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:03.120
What is it like to be somebody
who has to force themselves to

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:03.940
be virtuous?

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.950
Whose instincts run the
other direction?

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:11.560
But he's in a position and
need to ask that question

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:17.240
exactly because he'd already
told us in Book two what it is

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.960
like to be in this harmonious,
virtuous state.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:30.820
Now Julia Annas' suggestion is
that we can give articulation

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:36.910
to this idea in a contemporary
scientific paradigm by drawing

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:41.420
on a particular idea from
positive psychology,

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.950
this idea of flow.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:51.270
So Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a
Hungarian-born psychologist

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:57.860
has for the last 30 years or so
talked to people who excel

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:05.540
in some domain or other and
asked them what it feels like

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:10.650
when they are doing the activity
which they do so well

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:16.060
in a way that is completely
absorbing and engaging.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:19.620
So he talks to composers and he
talks to rock climbers and

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:25.600
he talks to firefighters and he
talks to musicians and he

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:31.280
asks them what it feels like to
be in a state: an athletic

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.150
state, a musical state, a
creative state, a state of

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:39.040
absorption in effective
parenting, whatever it is that

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.510
you do and you do well
and you enjoy.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:46.340
What does it feel like
to be in that state?

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:50.120
And what he says--as you should
know if you had the

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:54.780
chance to watch his TED talk--is
that it is when our

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:59.980
attention is deliberately
focused on what we are doing

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:05.040
that the action is most
experienced as effortless.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:10.440
In a state of complete
absorption, we're attentive to

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.320
the subtle nuances of
the experience.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:18.270
You're playing basketball and
the location of the hoop and

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:22.190
the ball and your hand and the
other players is just there

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.900
for you has as a single
apprehension.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:31.350
You're engaged in an absorbing
chess game and you have a feel

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.980
for the location of the
pieces on the board.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:39.030
You're engaged in a conversation
with someone you

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:44.010
love or someone you care for and
all of the nuances and all

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:46.630
of the subtleties of
that interaction

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:50.020
are apparent to you.

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:54.170
Now what Annas notices is that
there are two particular

00:22:54.170 --> 00:23:00.390
features of flow experience that
are actually central to

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:01.420
the ancient

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:05.530
harmony-of-the-soul notion of virtue.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:09.520
And the first is that flow
activity, activity in which

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.590
you are fully absorbed
is experienced as

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.400
what she calls autotelic.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.510
She's actually there making
use of terminology that

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:21.380
Csikszentmihalyi himself uses.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:26.800
Auto meaning self, telic
meaning end.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:32.380
Something that is autotelic
is an end in itself.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.740
It's not a means to an end.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.450
It's something that has--

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:40.810
wow, I'm remembering something
from Plato's Republic, from

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:44.480
those opening pages from our
very first reading assignment.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.590
It's something that
we experience as

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:51.120
having intrinsic value.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:55.700
It's something that when we do
it, we're not thinking of it

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.700
merely as a means to
some other end.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.910
We're thinking of it as
something that is enjoyable

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:05.416
for its own sake.

00:24:05.416 --> 00:24:08.560
A painter who's painting
paintings thinking: "How much

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:14.330
am I going to be able to sell
this for on the market?" is

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:17.890
not at the time of painting
absorbed in

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:21.230
painting for its own sake.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:25.640
An athlete who thinks about
their performance only in

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:29.830
terms of how many points it
will get for them or their

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:36.130
team won't become fully absorbed
in the activity.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:44.040
It turns out that even for
things of instrumental value,

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:50.470
the most effective way to do
with them with excellence is

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:56.690
to become so absorbed in them
that they feel to us to be of

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.250
intrinsic worth.

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:03.470
And this give us, I think, a new
insight on that three-way

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:08.250
divide that we had in the
opening pages of Book Two of

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.420
Plato's Republic when we were
told that there are things

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.320
that are instrumentally
valuable, things that are

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.855
intrinsically valuable and
things that are both.

00:25:15.855 --> 00:25:20.210
It gives us a way of
understanding how even for

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:23.580
things that are merely
instrumentally valuable, we

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:28.655
can get caught up in our
engagement with them in such a

00:25:28.655 --> 00:25:32.520
way that they feel to us to
have intrinsic worth.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.650
And this is of course, both
a virtue and a vice.

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:44.330
The most famous commodity with
merely instrumental value is

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:48.610
of course, money.

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:55.050
The bills in your pocket, I
hasten to tell you, are not

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:59.960
worth as pieces of paper
much more than a

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.500
fraction of a penny.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:07.990
But they have instrumental
value within a system of

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:11.420
economic give and take.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:15.110
But even within that system of
economic give and take, they

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:20.130
are only of instrumental value
because money for its own sake

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.980
isn't useful.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.530
Money is useful because it
allows us to purchase other

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:28.090
things that are useful
for their own sake--

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:35.210
beautiful cars, beautiful foods,
time to spend with our

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:39.470
friends and family,
opportunities to visit parts

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:40.070
of the world.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:43.000
All of those are things that
we can buy with money.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.360
But money in itself is of only
instrumental utility.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.740
Nonetheless, exactly the human
psychological function that

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:56.730
enables us to treat something
like making a shot in a

00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:00.140
basketball game, which is of
course only of instrumental

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:03.220
value, as if it were of
intrinsic value--that allows

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:06.740
us to get caught up in
experience, that allows us to

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:12.500
have this experience of flow,
can be redeployed so that we

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:17.130
come to think that whoever dies
with the largest number

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:23.090
in their bank account has
somehow won a game whose point

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:26.630
values weren't arbitrary.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:30.830
So there is--as is very often
the case--both an upside and a

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:35.070
downside to this fact about
human psychology: the fact

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:39.310
that we are capable of
experiencing things that might

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:44.776
not have intrinsic value
as if they did.

00:27:44.776 --> 00:27:49.570
And in fact, experiencing things
in that way is one of

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:53.600
the most powerfully engaging
things that we can do.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:58.200
Exactly because when all of
our energies are directed

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:04.700
towards the activity, we
lose ourselves in it.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.560
There is a feeling--and
Csikszentmihalyi describes

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.980
this beautifully in the last
five minutes of the TED talk

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.370
that I sent you to.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:15.535
There is this feeling of
complete absorption, a feeling

00:28:15.535 --> 00:28:20.040
of unselfconsciousness, a
feeling of a breakdown between

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:24.670
the boundaries of the self and
the boundaries of the world.

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:29.120
You become part of the scene
with respect to which you're

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.990
experiencing the flow.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:35.640
And indeed, the moment you let
self-consciousness reemerge,

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.400
the flow gets disrupted.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.790
Any of you who has never played
a sport or a musical

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:45.610
instrument or been in a play or
given a lecture knows the

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:49.250
danger of stepping out of the
scene and listening to

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:54.630
yourself doing it, how
disruptive that can be of the

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.450
experience.

00:28:56.450 --> 00:29:03.220
So Annas' suggestion is that
Aristotle's idea of virtue is

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:07.140
the idea that virtue
and the activity of

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:11.320
virtue should feel flow-like.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.910
It should feel absorbing.

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:16.530
It should feel non-reflective.

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:20.330
It should feel that when you are
in the act of being brave

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:25.660
or just or temperate or
magnanimous or magnificent or

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:29.780
any of the other Aristotelian
virtues, that what you

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:33.490
experience at that moment is
a feeling that you're doing

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:36.030
something about which
there was no choice.

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:40.442
This is just the way the world
is--with respect to which you

00:29:40.442 --> 00:29:43.140
feel there to be intrinsic
value.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:46.305
And where you feel fully
absorbed and unselfconsciuos.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:54.390
And Csikszentmihalyi goes on in
his more systematic work to

00:29:54.390 --> 00:30:00.270
explain that the reason that
this occurs is because there

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:06.680
is profound match between your
skill level and the challenge

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.250
that the activity
brings with it.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:16.790
When we are presented with a
task, which is not challenging

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:22.590
for us and with respect to which
we have low skill, we

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:26.940
experience what Csikszentmihalyi
calls apathy.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.990
So if there's something that's
not very hard for me, but I'm

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:35.270
not very good at it, there's
going to be little motivation

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:38.890
to respond to that
with engagement.

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:42.370
If my skill level is low and
the task is a little bit

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:46.340
harder, I might feel worried
in the face of my

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:49.100
inability to do it.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.810
And if my skill level is low
and the challenge level is

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:55.340
high, I might even
feel anxiety.

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:03.440
Moving over, if my skill level
is moderate and the activity

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.870
is of low challenge to
me, I'll experience

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:09.780
a feeling of boredom.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:12.320
I won't find myself
engaged by it.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.980
I'll find the situation
to be tedious.

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:18.310
If my skill level is medium and
the activity is of high

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:20.650
challenge, I might
feel aroused.

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:21.970
I might feel intrigued by it.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:26.750
I might feel some motivation
to act in that way.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:31.386
But the cases where we feel
the most excitement in the

00:31:31.386 --> 00:31:35.630
world are the cases where we
have the coping strategies

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:41.520
that enable us to act
effectively as agents.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.950
You'll recall that when we
read the material from

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:49.040
Jonathan Haidt for last class
and the class before, he

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:54.380
described an experiment that
was done on the floor of a

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:58.750
nursing home where the patients
were either given the

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:02.450
responsibility for caring for
the plants on the floor or

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:07.830
somebody else cared for the
plants on the floor.

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:11.730
And the happiness level of
those who were engaged in

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:17.270
productive activity
was much higher.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:23.160
Skillful coping, being able to
be a force of agency in the

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:28.620
world is for human
beings one of the

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:32.400
primary sources of happiness.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:37.490
And if we think back to what we
talked about a few classes

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:43.850
ago on the importance of early
childhood secure attachment,

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:47.600
one way of understanding what
secure attachment includes is

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.220
a feeling of agency
in the world.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:56.610
If when you cry it causes your
caregiver to come to you and

00:32:56.610 --> 00:33:01.502
satisfy your needs, you come
to feel yourself to be

00:33:01.502 --> 00:33:05.330
effective as an agent.

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:09.130
And so when our skill level is
high, even if the challenge

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:13.010
level is low, we'll feel
performing the activity a

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:14.220
certain kind of relaxation.

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:18.050
Those of you who play bubble
pop games on your telephone

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:22.280
and are good at them are
presumably experiencing that.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:26.680
Many times we have high skill
level with a low challenge

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:31.530
activity and it enables us to
feel that we're relaxing.

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:34.760
When we have high skill level
and a challenge that's medium

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:39.570
for us, we get this
thrill of control.

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:42.535
The idea that here's something
you're trying to do.

00:33:42.535 --> 00:33:46.030
You have pretty good mastery
of it and it gives you this

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.311
feeling of efficacy.

00:33:49.311 --> 00:33:54.820
And finally, we have one cell
unexposed in this matrix.

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:59.949
And that's the cell that asks us
what it's like when we have

00:33:59.949 --> 00:34:03.730
both high skill level and
a challenging activity.

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:06.290
And it won't surprise you
to learn that that

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:10.020
is where flow falls.

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:14.719
So Annas' suggestion, drawing
on Csikszentmihalyi as a way

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:19.880
of understanding Aristotle, is
that what it is like to be a

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:27.040
virtuous being from the inside
is to be fully absorbed in an

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.120
activity that is in some sense
enormously challenging.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.170
It involves scanning the world
in such a way that you

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:38.920
recognize what situations are
morally demanding and acting

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:42.590
skillfully, naturally,
effortlessly, happily in a

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:47.550
state of harmony, in a way that
conforms with what the

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:49.710
world demands of you.

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:55.690
And in so doing one is fully
absorbed in an activity which

00:34:55.690 --> 00:35:00.020
feels to one to be of
intrinsic worth.

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:05.480
And where the feeling of one's
self as a distinct agent

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:09.220
disappears because of
the absorption.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.430
So that's the first
of the articles

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:13.240
that we read for today.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.750
One which says, here's a demand
which Aristotle makes,

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:22.730
here's a way of understanding
that demand in the vocabulary

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:27.202
of a contemporary work
of social psychology.

00:35:27.202 --> 00:35:29.780
The second piece that
we read for today

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:33.220
does exactly the opposite.

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:36.800
John Doris, following a number
of other philosophers

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:41.700
including Gilbert Harman and
several others suggests that

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:47.020
contemporary social psychology
shows that it's circumstance

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.560
rather than character
that's the primary

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.640
determinant of action.

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:57.200
What determines how we act in
a situation says Doris, says

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:01.460
social psychology--that is,
Doris says social psychology

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:05.960
says--when we are in a situation
what determines our

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:10.710
action is not something stable
about our character, not

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:13.385
Aristotle's condition three
that it be a state that

00:36:13.385 --> 00:36:16.670
persists over time, but
rather incidental

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:17.920
features of the situation.

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:24.610
And as a result Aristotelian
moral psychology in particular

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:30.360
in its third condition demands
that we commit what social

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:34.510
psychologists call the
fundamental attribution error.

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:37.930
In order to explain the
fundamental attribution error,

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:44.236
let me present you with the
study that serves as the

00:36:44.236 --> 00:36:49.590
paradigm instance showing the
ways in which circumstance and

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:53.590
not character appear to
determine behavior.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:57.010
And I present this study to you
both because it's central

00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:02.210
to this literature, and because
our very class we read

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:04.850
a piece by one of its
authors, Batson.

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:07.540
And when we get to the
punishment section, we'll be

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:11.725
reading a piece by its other
author, John Darley.

00:37:11.725 --> 00:37:15.590
So the Good Samaritan parable
as those of you raised in

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:21.300
Christian religious traditions
know, is a story that Jesus

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:26.130
tells in the book of Luke when
he is asked basically the

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:28.720
question which we've asked Plato
and Aristotle to answer

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:33.300
for us: How is it that I can
behave in the way that

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.570
morality demands?

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:40.160
And the story that Jesus
tells runs as follows.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.920
"A certain man was going down
from Jerusalem to Jericho and

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.590
he fell among robbers who both
stripped him and beat him and

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:49.570
departed leaving
him half dead.

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:52.040
By chance a certain priest
was going down that way.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.695
When he saw him, he passed
by on the other side.

00:37:55.695 --> 00:37:59.566
In the same way, a Levite also
when he came to the place saw

00:37:59.566 --> 00:38:01.780
him and passed by
the other side.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.710
But a certain Samaritan as he
traveled came where he was

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:09.010
when he saw him, he was
moved with compassion.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:12.630
Came to him, bound up his
wounds, pouring on oil and

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:16.850
wine." That's apparently a nice
thing to do to wounds.

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:19.320
"Set him on his own animal,
brought him to an inn, took

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.390
care of him." And the
story continues.

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:24.260
He gives the innkeeper money
to take care of the man.

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:27.690
And Jesus says to the person who
asked for a story, "this

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.390
too should you do."

00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:34.150
So the story of the Good
Samaritan is a story that, if

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:39.160
you are thinking about it,
should lead you presumably to

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:44.910
recognize the virtue of helping
the stranger in need.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:49.570
It should make it particularly
salient to you that among the

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:52.930
moral demands that the world
places on you is that if

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:57.840
somebody is lying injured along
the wayside, and you are

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:02.550
in a position to help them, then
it would be in keeping

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:07.270
with the demands of morality for
you to stop and lean down

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:10.740
and pour oil and wine onto his
wounds--or whatever the

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:14.390
contemporary analog
of that is.

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:21.740
So the study that Darley and
Batson did ran as follows.

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:26.270
They took a bunch of divinity
school students at Princeton--

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:28.652
young seminarians.

00:39:28.652 --> 00:39:30.180
You can see them there in their

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:33.392
young seminarian outfits.

00:39:33.392 --> 00:39:42.520
And it asked some of them to
prepare a sermon on the

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.110
parable of the Good Samaritan.

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:48.660
So these are divinity school
students, presumably people

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:52.160
who are committed to developing
moral character in

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.400
themselves.

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.232
And what they've been asked to
do is to prepare a sermon on

00:39:57.232 --> 00:40:01.250
something that makes very, very
salient to them that if

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:05.860
you stumble upon somebody who
is in need of your help, you

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.915
should stop and help them.

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:12.210
And then what Batson and Darley
did is they told some

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:15.410
of these people that they were
in a great rush to get to the

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:17.050
other side of campus where
they needed to

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:19.170
deliver their lecture.

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:23.150
And some of them they
didn't tell this to.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:26.010
And some of the seminarians had
been told to do the Good

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:29.120
Samaritan story and some of the
seminarians had been told

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.750
to prepare another story.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:35.880
Now you might thank if the
hypothesis that what

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:41.530
determines behavior is character
were true that those

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:46.490
seminarians who had prepared a
lecture on the Good Samaritan

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:51.445
would be particularly likely to
recognize the moral needs

00:40:51.445 --> 00:40:55.180
attaching to stumbling upon
somebody who was injured.

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.680
And that the question of whether
they were late or

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:02.900
early to give their lecture
would have no bearing.

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:05.230
Darley and Batson decided
to test this.

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:10.780
What they did is they had the
seminarians walk over towards

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:11.530
the lecture hall.

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:16.240
And on their way there was
somebody lying on the sidewalk

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:20.390
in need of their help.

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:25.640
Now, what was predictive of
whether the seminarians

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:31.080
stopped to help this man on the
wayside was not whether

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.790
they had prepared a story about
the Good Samaritan.

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:38.160
It was whether they were in a
rush to get to their lecture.

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:41.020
And those of them who were,
very often not only didn't

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:46.690
help the man, they stepped over
his body and rushed over

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:49.550
to the theater.

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:52.430
Now all of us have
experienced this.

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:56.760
If I'm in a rush to pick up my
kids and I have to pull over

00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:00.510
because there's an ambulance
coming the other way, I feel

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:02.740
incredible annoyance.

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:03.990
Why?

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:07.440
Because I think, "oh that person
in the ambulance, they

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:12.630
deserve to die because I've got
to pick up my kids?" No,

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:16.360
it's because when our attention
is directed towards

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:21.630
an external goal, it is very
hard for us to be attentive to

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:26.030
the moral features
of a situation.

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:32.590
And it turns out, over and over
and over again that when

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:35.920
we're trying to decide what
led somebody to act in a

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.350
particular way, we have a
tendency to over-credit

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:41.470
features on their
character--dispositional

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:46.930
features--and under-credit
situational features--features

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:48.780
of the circumstance.

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:53.210
So we think be for example, that
whether or not-- this is

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:55.810
the opening case in Doris'
paper-- whether or not you're

00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:59.340
likely to help somebody pick up
their papers when they drop

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:01.780
them depends upon a feature
of your character.

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.760
Are you a helpful person
or an unhelpful person?

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.600
But it looks like you can
manipulate whether people are

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.840
going to be willing to help
simply by letting them find a

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.540
dime in a phone booth.

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:14.590
(If you don't know what a phone
booth is, there's a

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:18.060
movie called The Matrix and they
have phone booths in it.)

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:20.560
Whether or not they find a dime
in the phone booth is

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.380
what determines whether
they help.

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:24.580
In the Good Samaritan study,
it's not whether they're

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:26.560
thinking about being
helpful--it's whether

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:27.610
they're in a rush.

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:31.730
In the Milgram experiments,
it's not about whether in

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:35.440
general they behave one way or
the other--it's whether they

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.170
find themselves in a
circumstance where a demand is

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:39.230
made of them.

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:42.320
In the Vietnam "moral luck"
cases, it's not that these

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.330
young men who went to Vietnam
and found themselves in a

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:48.640
circumstance had a character
that would lead them to act in

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.630
that way says this theory--it's
that they found

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:55.500
themselves in this
circumstance.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:59.760
So says John Doris,
the Aristotelian

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.860
theory can't be right.

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:08.210
It presupposes a faulty picture
of human psychology.

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:09.890
It's 11:20 now.

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:13.800
At the beginning of next
lecture, I'll pick up again

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:18.200
with two results from social
psychology that challenge, in

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:21.270
certain ways, the claim that
Doris is making against

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:24.410
Aristotle, and then we'll
continue with our discussion

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:29.810
of Aristotle's counter side to
this--what we do in cases of

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:32.705
weakness of the will and what
strategies are available to us

00:44:32.705 --> 00:44:35.605
if we don't satisfy Aristotle's
four conditions.

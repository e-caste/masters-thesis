00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.865
Professor David Blight:
Frederick Douglass gave a

00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:11.508
speech in 1875 that gives us a
question that we might keep in

00:00:11.508 --> 00:00:14.990
mind right through the end of
the course.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.050
Let's call this "Douglass's
question."

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.561
It's a speech he gives in 1875
in Washington,

00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:23.355
D.C.
Note the year--it's 1875,

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:28.077
he's anticipating--it's the
4^(th) of July--and he's

00:00:28.077 --> 00:00:32.060
anticipating the coming year of
the U.S.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.942
centennial of independence,
and he knows it's going to be a

00:00:35.942 --> 00:00:38.821
big national celebration;
and it will be,

00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:42.180
and I'll say something more on
that next week.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.664
Philadelphia put on an
extraordinary exhibition that

00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:49.080
nearly one-tenth of the American
people visited.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.997
But Douglass is anticipating
this national centennial,

00:00:54.997 --> 00:01:00.579
ten years after the Civil War,
and he's worried.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.407
He said, "The nation"--and I'm
quoting him--"would lift to the

00:01:05.407 --> 00:01:09.838
sky its million voices in one
grand centennial hosanna of

00:01:09.838 --> 00:01:13.400
peace and goodwill to all the
white race,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.390
from gulf to lakes,
and from sea to sea."

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.054
And as a black citizen,
he dreaded the day,

00:01:22.054 --> 00:01:25.860
he said--listen to his words,
it's one of the most racialized

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.345
speeches Douglass ever gave.
He said he dreaded the day

00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:34.313
when, his words,
"this great white race has

00:01:34.313 --> 00:01:39.414
renewed its vows of patriotism
and flowed back into its

00:01:39.414 --> 00:01:43.253
accustomed channels."
He was proud,

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:48.360
he said, to be an American,
but he was worried.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.290
And then he ended with this
question.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.786
"If war among the whites
brought peace and liberty to

00:01:55.786 --> 00:02:00.109
blacks, what will peace among
the whites bring?"

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:04.900
What would peace among the
whites bring?

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.573
It's a way of shaping an
overall question,

00:02:08.573 --> 00:02:12.514
and Douglass did it for us,
as to how and why

00:02:12.514 --> 00:02:18.681
Reconstruction ended up eroding,
collapsing if you want,

00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:23.758
failing as some say--ending.
Now one of the things we're

00:02:23.758 --> 00:02:26.849
going to begin to examine today,
and the rest of the course,

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.695
is this question--sorry to keep
putting the outline back up--but

00:02:32.695 --> 00:02:35.239
we are always,
as historians,

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.259
debating this question of ends.
When did Reconstruction end?

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.321
As we'll see in a moment,
many are going to claim it's

00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:46.210
all over when they pass the
Fifteenth Amendment.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.740
That's what Horace Greeley said;
that's 1870.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.227
And then there are those who
argue, "Reconstruction now it

00:02:56.227 --> 00:03:00.871
really ended in 1873," and there
are reasons you might argue

00:03:00.871 --> 00:03:03.857
that;
the horrifying Colfax Massacre

00:03:03.857 --> 00:03:07.349
in Louisiana on Easter Sunday,
April 14^(th),

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.712
1873, the largest domestic
murder, collective mass murder

00:03:12.712 --> 00:03:17.691
in all of American history,
until 9/11, and the following

00:03:17.691 --> 00:03:21.789
Supreme Court decision,
based upon the investigation of

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:25.397
that massacre;
and I'm going to deal with

00:03:25.397 --> 00:03:28.870
Colfax next Tuesday.
Some would argue that really

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.870
shows us an end of
Reconstruction.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.312
But all the southern states
weren't yet back under the

00:03:33.312 --> 00:03:36.590
control of the Democratic Party.
So there are those who argue,

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.008
"no, no, no,
Reconstruction doesn't really

00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:42.134
end until you have the full
redemption by the Southern

00:03:42.134 --> 00:03:44.669
Democrats of their state
governments,"

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.533
which doesn't occur until the
disputed Election of 1876,

00:03:48.533 --> 00:03:52.657
and its compromise of 1877;
and we'll deal with that in a

00:03:52.657 --> 00:03:55.112
week in a half.
But then there are plenty of

00:03:55.112 --> 00:03:57.297
others now who argue,
no, no, no, Reconstruction

00:03:57.297 --> 00:03:59.530
never really ended in the
nineteenth century.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.079
Heather Cox Richardson has a
book out now about the story of

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.328
Reconstruction and its issues
moving west in the United

00:04:06.328 --> 00:04:08.877
States,
throughout the rest of the

00:04:08.877 --> 00:04:11.022
nineteenth century.
Steve Prince,

00:04:11.022 --> 00:04:13.791
one of your teaching
assistants, has a chapter in his

00:04:13.791 --> 00:04:16.560
dissertation entitled The Ends
of Reconstruction;

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.451
he's playing off that irony or
that pun of when did it end,

00:04:21.451 --> 00:04:24.908
did it ever end?
Sam Schaffer's going to argue

00:04:24.908 --> 00:04:28.050
it didn't end until 1912,
in his dissertation.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.930
I've got another graduate
student, Owen Williams,

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.350
who's writing a dissertation on
the Reconstruction Supreme

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.896
Court,
and he's arguing it absolutely

00:04:36.896 --> 00:04:40.326
ended in 1873.
This is the sort of inside

00:04:40.326 --> 00:04:44.009
baseball that historians love to
play.

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.680
Name your date and then fight
over it.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.811
We tell the world dates don't
matter, and we love to fight

00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:50.260
over them.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.232
I'm probably going to do what I
usually do which is leave you

00:04:58.232 --> 00:05:01.000
with a good deal of ambiguity
about that.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.050
In some ways Reconstruction has
never ended.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:14.783
Now, think with me for a moment
though, back on the ground in

00:05:14.783 --> 00:05:24.389
the South about this question of
the real lives of the freedmen,

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.297
the transformations to new
labor arrangements,

00:05:28.297 --> 00:05:30.990
this vexing,
knotty, chaotic,

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.337
in some ways terrible process,
by which slave labor converted

00:05:36.337 --> 00:05:41.507
to free labor and ultimately
into sharecropping as a system

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:46.498
in which approximately eighty
percent of all the freedmen

00:05:46.498 --> 00:05:50.420
found themselves essentially
mired in,

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.207
as early as the late 1860s and
surely by the 1870s and

00:05:55.207 --> 00:05:58.639
throughout the rest of that
century.

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.924
One of the greatest memoirs we
have--it's an odd kind of

00:06:01.924 --> 00:06:04.971
memoir--but one of the greatest
memoirs we have by a

00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:08.674
sharecropper--and I don't know
if you've ever read this book in

00:06:08.674 --> 00:06:11.298
a course,
it gets widely taught,

00:06:11.298 --> 00:06:15.069
often in African-American
history courses--is the

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:19.940
autobiography of Nate Shaw
called All God's Dangers.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.749
His real name was Ned Cobb;
name was changed,

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:27.949
I guess to protect him,
in the title.

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:32.863
It's an extraordinary series of
hundreds of hours of interviews

00:06:32.863 --> 00:06:37.459
that Ted Rosengarten did with
him some 25 years ago now.

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:39.596
Ned Cobb lived a very,
very long life,

00:06:39.596 --> 00:06:41.906
into the middle of the
twentieth century,

00:06:41.906 --> 00:06:45.923
but he grew up a sharecropper.
And there are a thousand

00:06:45.923 --> 00:06:49.943
nuggets of wisdom,
or the secrets from his past,

00:06:49.943 --> 00:06:54.477
as he often calls them,
that Ned Cobb/Nate Shaw has to

00:06:54.477 --> 00:06:57.705
give us.
There's this honest section

00:06:57.705 --> 00:07:01.936
about how he never got an
education, and how he resents

00:07:01.936 --> 00:07:07.311
that he never got an education,
and how he resents actually

00:07:07.311 --> 00:07:12.434
that his father never even
sought to help get him an

00:07:12.434 --> 00:07:15.635
education.
"I didn't never get out of the

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:19.015
first reader.
Got no education to speak of,

00:07:19.015 --> 00:07:24.178
and another hurt addition to
that, weren't no colored schools

00:07:24.178 --> 00:07:28.653
through here"--and this is
central Alabama--"worth no

00:07:28.653 --> 00:07:32.186
count.
You might find a school close

00:07:32.186 --> 00:07:36.379
to town somewhere that
accommodated the colored,

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:40.750
and if you did you were doin'
well," said Ned.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.508
"My daddy, when he had the
opportunity, never did send me

00:07:44.508 --> 00:07:47.259
to school long enough to learn
to read.

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:51.067
If he sent his children he'd
have to supplement the teacher's

00:07:51.067 --> 00:07:54.748
salary, but if he don't send his
children it don't cost him

00:07:54.748 --> 00:07:59.889
nothin',
and there's nothin' said.

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:03.554
None of my brothers and
sisters, not one by name,

00:08:03.554 --> 00:08:06.990
got a good book learning,
and all I can do,

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:14.280
I can put down on paper some
little old figures but I can't

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:20.398
add 'em up."
Now, Ned went on to be a land

00:08:20.398 --> 00:08:23.897
owner.
One of the most moving passages

00:08:23.897 --> 00:08:28.870
in this book comes toward the
end when he buys his first mule,

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:35.409
when he puts his first
stinking, smelly mule in his own

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:38.536
stable.
It's like a religious

00:08:38.536 --> 00:08:42.735
experience.
Smelling a mule is not exactly

00:08:42.735 --> 00:08:48.200
my idea of a religious
experience, but it was to Ned.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.000
But he really is hard on his
father.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.389
It's an honest,
honest illustration of how the

00:08:56.389 --> 00:09:01.852
sons and daughters of the
freedmen--and Ned is the son of

00:09:01.852 --> 00:09:06.340
a former slave--were inheriting
so little.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:12.300
I mentioned the other day that
what the freedmen had was some

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.138
human capital,
their skills,

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:17.538
their bodies,
their labor,

00:09:17.538 --> 00:09:20.227
their dreams,
their religion,

00:09:20.227 --> 00:09:23.475
their ideas,
their self-worth,

00:09:23.475 --> 00:09:27.753
their dignity,
but they had so little physical

00:09:27.753 --> 00:09:32.505
capital, they owned nothing,
and they had no money,

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:37.100
no credit, so few ways of
getting any physical capital.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.121
He goes on and on and on.
I won't quote it but he

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:44.687
continually refers to what he
called his father's "old slavery

00:09:44.687 --> 00:09:47.889
thoughts."
He complains about how his

00:09:47.889 --> 00:09:51.663
father never learned how to put
up any money,

00:09:51.663 --> 00:09:56.733
never learned to save anything,
and that he hadn't learned it

00:09:56.733 --> 00:10:00.309
very well either.
In fact, here's what he says.

00:10:00.309 --> 00:10:04.345
He said, "My daddy was
blindfolded, didn't look to the

00:10:04.345 --> 00:10:08.608
future, just throwing"--I'm
sorry for the direct language

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:13.176
here--"just throwing his money
in a dead hog's ass and taking

00:10:13.176 --> 00:10:19.509
shit."
Sorry about that, on the video.

00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:23.179
But Ned Cobb's directness is
useful.

00:10:23.179 --> 00:10:26.975
It's in the face of those kinds
of obstacles,

00:10:26.975 --> 00:10:31.719
we can tamely call them,
but nevertheless thousands upon

00:10:31.719 --> 00:10:36.808
thousands of freedmen embraced
an education and embraced the

00:10:36.808 --> 00:10:42.010
hope that literacy could bring.
And let me focus on that,

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:45.245
just briefly at least.
Mired in this system of

00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:47.174
sharecropping,
working on halves,

00:10:47.174 --> 00:10:50.668
giving half their crop to the
landowner and half their crop

00:10:50.668 --> 00:10:53.320
they would keep and hopefully
get cash,

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.206
but then that cash had to be
spent down at the furnishing

00:10:58.206 --> 00:11:03.789
merchant to get seeds and get
tools and get food and clothing.

00:11:03.789 --> 00:11:07.146
Nevertheless,
in the face of all of this,

00:11:07.146 --> 00:11:11.594
one of the things a freedman
most wanted was this book

00:11:11.594 --> 00:11:14.700
learning that Ned Cobb never
got.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.950
What we know about slave
literacy and freedmen's literacy

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.768
is essentially this.
At the end of the Civil War

00:11:22.768 --> 00:11:26.826
probably five percent,
maybe seven percent to eight,

00:11:26.826 --> 00:11:30.009
of the American slaves were
literate.

00:11:30.009 --> 00:11:36.114
By 1870 that had increased to
perhaps twelve to fifteen

00:11:36.114 --> 00:11:41.555
percent, and that was due,
of course, to the freedmen's

00:11:41.555 --> 00:11:45.049
schools, to the Freedmen's
Bureau schools.

00:11:45.049 --> 00:11:48.039
There were tremendous
accomplishments in these

00:11:48.039 --> 00:11:52.025
Freedmen's Bureau schools.
They created over 4000 of them,

00:11:52.025 --> 00:11:55.796
and there were some 9300
teachers at one time or another

00:11:55.796 --> 00:11:59.909
employed in Freedmen's Bureau
schools, up into the 1870s.

00:11:59.909 --> 00:12:03.858
They had at one point slightly
more than a quarter million

00:12:03.858 --> 00:12:07.529
students in these schools,
freedmen, young and old;

00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:10.843
sixty-eight,
seventy-two year-old former

00:12:10.843 --> 00:12:15.771
slaves would sit down in the
same room with eight year-olds

00:12:15.771 --> 00:12:20.190
and begin to try to read out of
the same reader.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:23.342
And there were in some ways
nothing more threatening,

00:12:23.342 --> 00:12:26.737
to white Southerners--actually
there were two things most

00:12:26.737 --> 00:12:28.980
threatening to white
Southerners,

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:33.250
around which this Southern
counter-revolution will be

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:36.010
forged.
One was the black school,

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.403
black literacy,
education, the potential of

00:12:39.403 --> 00:12:43.444
mobility, and the education
particularly of a black

00:12:43.444 --> 00:12:48.304
political leadership class.
And then on the other hand,

00:12:48.304 --> 00:12:52.263
directly related,
of course, was the creation of

00:12:52.263 --> 00:12:55.891
black politics itself.
As we'll see in a moment,

00:12:55.891 --> 00:12:58.568
one of the major targets of the
Ku Klux Klan,

00:12:58.568 --> 00:13:00.820
the Knights of the White
Camellia,

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:05.741
and all the other groups that
imitated these,

00:13:05.741 --> 00:13:10.788
were black schools.
Dozens and dozens of black

00:13:10.788 --> 00:13:16.703
schools were burned to the
ground by the Klan between 1868

00:13:16.703 --> 00:13:22.620
and the middle of the 1870s.
I want to just read just one

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:27.830
little example of what these
schools meant to people.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:31.949
I love this little letter
because of the assumption,

00:13:31.949 --> 00:13:37.120
let's call it audacity of hope
if you want--forgive the title.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:43.289
This comes from a black school
principal whose name was P.B.

00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:46.514
Randolph.
He's running a Freedman's

00:13:46.514 --> 00:13:49.169
school in New Orleans,
in 1866.

00:13:49.169 --> 00:13:52.477
They named it for William Lloyd
Garrison, it's called the

00:13:52.477 --> 00:13:56.397
Garrison School.
He has 373 pupils and he has

00:13:56.397 --> 00:13:59.866
seven teachers,
five of them black,

00:13:59.866 --> 00:14:03.970
two of them white.
And this was the revolution,

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:07.049
the potential revolution of
Reconstruction.

00:14:07.049 --> 00:14:10.676
And he writes this letter to
himself, William Lloyd Garrison,

00:14:10.676 --> 00:14:13.940
asking for Garrison to help
them get what they need.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:19.460
Just a small excerpt of it.
"We are proud of our pupils and

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:24.197
feel you will rejoice with us.
We feel also that you will not

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:28.833
take amiss if we ask a little
assistance from Boston in the

00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:32.509
shape of apparatus to illustrate
astronomy,

00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:36.774
a gyroscope and a microscope,
a numerical frame,

00:14:36.774 --> 00:14:39.950
conic sections,
cube root blocks,

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:45.005
a magnet, and such other
instruments as will enable us to

00:14:45.005 --> 00:14:49.700
fight this battle for our race
against ignorance."

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:55.710
Send us the simplest implements
to teach some science.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:15:01.984
There are thousands of those
such letters all over the

00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:05.689
record.
Literacy among blacks increased

00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:09.179
to over eighty percent by
1880--I'm sorry,

00:15:09.179 --> 00:15:13.606
over twenty percent by
1880--and probably twenty-five

00:15:13.606 --> 00:15:18.118
to thirty percent-- these things
are very difficult to

00:15:18.118 --> 00:15:22.629
measure--by the turn of the
twentieth century.

00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:24.649
Now you need to know one other
thing here.

00:15:24.649 --> 00:15:29.152
By the 1880s,
1890s, turn of the twentieth

00:15:29.152 --> 00:15:35.522
century, literacy rates among
southern whites were not that

00:15:35.522 --> 00:15:40.202
much higher.
Now remember one thing above

00:15:40.202 --> 00:15:45.735
all else about these new
economic, social arrangements

00:15:45.735 --> 00:15:52.519
taking hold from 1866 right on
through the 1870s in the South.

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:57.628
Sharecropping emerged--this is
the argument--sharecropping

00:15:57.628 --> 00:16:02.467
emerged essentially as a kind of
compromise result of a

00:16:02.467 --> 00:16:06.590
tug-of-war between two kinds of
interests.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:11.970
Blacks wanted autonomy.
They wanted out of gangs.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.950
They wanted their women out of
the field.

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:18.600
They wanted some control over
their economic lives.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:23.685
White folks,
the owners, land owners,

00:16:23.685 --> 00:16:28.489
wanted labor control,
a stationary,

00:16:28.489 --> 00:16:35.598
dependent, poor labor force.
Both sides end up embracing

00:16:35.598 --> 00:16:38.377
tenant farming,
sharecropping,

00:16:38.377 --> 00:16:43.649
because it was such a
desperately cash poor society.

00:16:43.649 --> 00:16:47.246
Land owners didn't want to rent
to blacks because they knew in

00:16:47.246 --> 00:16:50.960
the long run blacks wouldn't get
enough cash to pay the rent.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.859
Blacks realized quickly they
couldn't depend on cash because

00:16:53.859 --> 00:16:56.956
there wasn't enough.
They therefore themselves began

00:16:56.956 --> 00:16:59.753
to resist wages,
because they'd get promised

00:16:59.753 --> 00:17:02.419
wages and then they wouldn't get
paid.

00:17:02.419 --> 00:17:05.262
So sharecropping,
this system that ultimately

00:17:05.262 --> 00:17:09.397
becomes a Faustian bargain and a
dead end and a kind of tragic no

00:17:09.397 --> 00:17:13.904
exit for the vast majority,
was nevertheless something they

00:17:13.904 --> 00:17:17.540
actually negotiated and embraced
themselves.

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:26.787
Now, also on the ground,
in the South,

00:17:26.787 --> 00:17:32.380
emerging, out of Radical
Reconstruction,

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:37.242
as the Southern states were put
under the First Reconstruction

00:17:37.242 --> 00:17:40.829
Act and the subsequent
Reconstruction Acts,

00:17:40.829 --> 00:17:44.592
what took place in the South
was the creation of new state

00:17:44.592 --> 00:17:48.157
governments run by the
Republican Party in every former

00:17:48.157 --> 00:17:52.569
Confederate state,
at least at first.

00:17:52.569 --> 00:17:55.926
All the ex-Confederate states
were readmitted to the Union

00:17:55.926 --> 00:17:59.140
between 1868 and 1870;
Georgia was the last.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:04.743
But by 1870 all eleven
ex-Confederate states are back

00:18:04.743 --> 00:18:08.437
in the Union.
But they're back in the Union,

00:18:08.437 --> 00:18:11.900
remember, under that Radical
Reconstruction Plan.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.905
Now the story that set in about
this, over the years,

00:18:14.905 --> 00:18:18.431
from the Lost Cause ideology of
the late nineteenth century to

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:21.783
the writings of the so-called
Dunning School at the turn of

00:18:21.783 --> 00:18:25.019
the twentieth century and early
twentieth century,

00:18:25.019 --> 00:18:28.013
based on the writings of
William H.

00:18:28.013 --> 00:18:32.238
Dunning and his many,
many students he trained at

00:18:32.238 --> 00:18:36.023
Columbia University,
was this idea that what

00:18:36.023 --> 00:18:41.569
happened in the South now was
essentially carpetbag rule,

00:18:41.569 --> 00:18:49.809
or rule by bayonet,
or rule by blacks.

00:18:49.809 --> 00:18:53.996
Now in the history books we've
come to call this,

00:18:53.996 --> 00:18:57.660
for decades,
the myth of carpetbag rule,

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:02.542
this idea that the South was
colonized, taken over by

00:19:02.542 --> 00:19:07.768
Northerners who moved south,
white Northerners who moved

00:19:07.768 --> 00:19:10.355
south, applying,
appealing to,

00:19:10.355 --> 00:19:15.528
exploiting and manipulating the
black vote to take over the

00:19:15.528 --> 00:19:19.397
South,
to disfranchise and eliminate

00:19:19.397 --> 00:19:23.480
white Southerners from their own
polity.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:28.223
Now this much is true:
In every former Confederate

00:19:28.223 --> 00:19:33.451
state the so-called radical
constitutions did manage to

00:19:33.451 --> 00:19:38.140
create all sorts of new levels,
if you like,

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.849
of democracy,
small-"d".

00:19:40.849 --> 00:19:43.579
The number of elective offices
increased.

00:19:43.579 --> 00:19:46.669
There was more direct election,
more direct control for people

00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:49.861
than the South had ever seen.
There were more people voting,

00:19:49.861 --> 00:19:52.616
more constituencies,
and more people holding office,

00:19:52.616 --> 00:19:55.874
as we'll see in a second.
There was more home rule for

00:19:55.874 --> 00:19:59.299
local governments than they'd
ever experienced before.

00:19:59.299 --> 00:20:02.371
These new radical
constitutions,

00:20:02.371 --> 00:20:08.019
yes indeed, had eventually a
fair degree of corruption.

00:20:08.019 --> 00:20:11.300
This was the age of spoils and
the kinds of corruption going on

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.476
in southern state governments
was no different than the kinds

00:20:14.476 --> 00:20:17.809
of corruption going on in many
other places in the country.

00:20:17.809 --> 00:20:20.639
But there were many social
provisions in these new

00:20:20.639 --> 00:20:22.950
constitutions,
as long as they lasted.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.783
And they lasted seven,
eight and nine years,

00:20:25.783 --> 00:20:29.407
in some ex-Confederate states,
and they only lasted two,

00:20:29.407 --> 00:20:31.779
three, and four years in
others.

00:20:31.779 --> 00:20:37.480
For the first time there were
social provisions.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.684
They not only did away with the
Black Codes but they established

00:20:40.684 --> 00:20:42.769
a certain degree of equal civil
rights.

00:20:42.769 --> 00:20:45.827
Some of these new state
governments actually passed

00:20:45.827 --> 00:20:48.891
Civil Rights Acts.
Many of the constitutions made

00:20:48.891 --> 00:20:52.452
it the state's responsibility
now to--for the first time in

00:20:52.452 --> 00:20:55.336
Southern history;
and for that matter there

00:20:55.336 --> 00:20:59.577
wasn't much of this in the North
either--to provide for the sick,

00:20:59.577 --> 00:21:02.890
the insane, the disabled,
the poverty stricken.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.678
And above all else they created
public schools,

00:21:05.678 --> 00:21:08.769
the first public schools the
South had ever seen.

00:21:08.769 --> 00:21:13.772
South Carolina had the first
comprehensive school law of any

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:16.569
southern state,
passed in 1870.

00:21:16.569 --> 00:21:22.103
By 1871 they had thirty-two
percent of people of school age

00:21:22.103 --> 00:21:26.206
attending some 1700 public
schools, in South

00:21:26.206 --> 00:21:31.934
Carolina--blacks and whites.
And by 1875 the South Carolina

00:21:31.934 --> 00:21:35.767
public school system,
created by the Radical

00:21:35.767 --> 00:21:39.789
Republican regime,
had fifty percent--this is

00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:44.584
still a rural society and a
society ridden with problems of

00:21:44.584 --> 00:21:48.440
race and violence,
as we'll see--by 1875 they had

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:52.823
fifty percent of the school age
population of South Carolina in

00:21:52.823 --> 00:21:55.655
school,
with over 3000 teachers paid by

00:21:55.655 --> 00:21:56.890
public tax money.

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:05.605
Now, the one thing,
of course, that virtually no

00:22:05.605 --> 00:22:09.679
southern, Radical Republican,
southern regime ever

00:22:09.679 --> 00:22:14.215
accomplished was much in the way
of any kind of economic

00:22:14.215 --> 00:22:17.859
redistribution,
of land redistribution.

00:22:17.859 --> 00:22:20.849
This is our classic problem of
Reconstruction.

00:22:20.849 --> 00:22:24.266
How could you advance political
liberty, the right to vote,

00:22:24.266 --> 00:22:26.269
to hold office,
serve on juries,

00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:30.850
run legislatures,
and yet why does economic

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:35.650
liberty always,
always, always lag behind?

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:37.980
Now, there were some attempts,
however.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.720
Let me give you just one little
example.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.650
I don't think Foner really even
mentions this.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:46.737
Again, South Carolina,
which had a black majority of

00:22:46.737 --> 00:22:50.103
its legislature for about five
years during

00:22:50.103 --> 00:22:54.109
Reconstruction--this was
political revolution,

00:22:54.109 --> 00:22:57.775
and you can see why white
Southerners were organizing

00:22:57.775 --> 00:23:01.230
against it--but the South
Carolina Legislature,

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:03.551
run by blacks,
by blacks and white

00:23:03.551 --> 00:23:07.210
Republicans, some of them native
born Southerners,

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:11.501
some of them from the North,
created a South Carolina Land

00:23:11.501 --> 00:23:16.200
Commission.
They created it in 1868.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.367
It actually is going to last
all the way to 1890,

00:23:20.367 --> 00:23:25.082
on the books.
It settled some 5000 South

00:23:25.082 --> 00:23:29.545
Carolina families,
black and white,

00:23:29.545 --> 00:23:34.269
on land that the state
purchased,

00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:39.686
or took over--confiscated--in
effect, and then began to sell

00:23:39.686 --> 00:23:43.450
to its own citizens on long-term
loans,

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:50.205
at very reduced interest rates.
Approximately $225,000 out of

00:23:50.205 --> 00:23:56.089
$802,000 eventually could not be
accounted for.

00:23:56.089 --> 00:23:58.707
There was some fraud and
corruption in this South

00:23:58.707 --> 00:24:02.506
Carolina Land Commission.
About a quarter of the money

00:24:02.506 --> 00:24:07.160
that they actually distributed
never was accounted for.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.167
But it's extremely important to
note here that at least an

00:24:10.167 --> 00:24:13.151
attempt was made.
Here was at least the

00:24:13.151 --> 00:24:16.829
possibility of Radical
Reconstruction.

00:24:16.829 --> 00:24:21.036
By 1876 that Land Commission in
South Carolina--by '76

00:24:21.036 --> 00:24:25.243
Republicans still barely
controlled the South Carolina

00:24:25.243 --> 00:24:29.533
state government,
they're about to lose it that

00:24:29.533 --> 00:24:34.420
year--by 1876 about 14,000
families had participated,

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:38.766
a total of about 70,000 people,
about sixty percent black and

00:24:38.766 --> 00:24:43.660
forty percent white,
in actually buying land.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:48.786
By 1884 more blacks were losing
land in South Carolina,

00:24:48.786 --> 00:24:51.730
however, than were buying it.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.644
I'll give you one last little
number to show at least what the

00:24:59.644 --> 00:25:04.102
possibilities had been.
In the Census of 1890 about

00:25:04.102 --> 00:25:10.525
13,000 blacks in South Carolina
owned a farm of some size,

00:25:10.525 --> 00:25:16.047
4,000 of whom had purchased
them through that Land

00:25:16.047 --> 00:25:19.123
Commission.
Now, we are always talking

00:25:19.123 --> 00:25:21.181
about the possibilities,
the experiments of

00:25:21.181 --> 00:25:23.680
Reconstruction--"what if," "what
if," "what if?"

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.910
What if there'd been more
enforcement?

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:26.829
What if there'd been more
military occupation?

00:25:26.829 --> 00:25:31.753
What if the Klan and its
imitators had truly been

00:25:31.753 --> 00:25:38.285
crushed--altogether crushed?
This kind of land commission is

00:25:38.285 --> 00:25:44.303
one example, among others,
of the kinds of efforts that

00:25:44.303 --> 00:25:49.843
could have flourished.
Now, in those state governments

00:25:49.843 --> 00:25:53.573
in the South,
you had for the first time in

00:25:53.573 --> 00:25:58.180
American history,
and in a kind of a explosion of

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.832
political activity,
you had black elected

00:26:01.832 --> 00:26:04.638
officials;
approximately 200

00:26:04.638 --> 00:26:09.876
African-Americans in the
Southern states served in state

00:26:09.876 --> 00:26:13.080
legislatures,
in state government and

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.442
executive positions,
and ultimately in the U.S.

00:26:16.442 --> 00:26:19.641
Congress.
Sixteen African-Americans from

00:26:19.641 --> 00:26:23.123
ex-Confederate states were
elected to the U.S.

00:26:23.123 --> 00:26:26.781
Congress, two to the U.S.
Senate--Hiram Revels from

00:26:26.781 --> 00:26:29.883
Mississippi being the first
black senator in American

00:26:29.883 --> 00:26:32.286
history.
And how many times do you hear

00:26:32.286 --> 00:26:35.372
in our political culture today,
"the first black since

00:26:35.372 --> 00:26:37.564
Reconstruction;
the first this since

00:26:37.564 --> 00:26:39.380
Reconstruction;
the first that--."

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:44.048
The first black governor since
Reconstruction was Doug Wilder,

00:26:44.048 --> 00:26:47.115
in Virginia.
The first this and the first

00:26:47.115 --> 00:26:51.313
that, since Reconstruction.
It's because there was this

00:26:51.313 --> 00:26:56.127
explosion of black political
activity, for a short period of

00:26:56.127 --> 00:27:00.369
time, a decade really,
until the lights went out.

00:27:00.369 --> 00:27:04.468
Of the 1000 delegates to
Constitutional writing

00:27:04.468 --> 00:27:08.566
conventions, in 1868,
'69, when these new state

00:27:08.566 --> 00:27:12.740
governments were created,
of about the 1000 delegates

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.920
that participated in writing
those new Constitutions,

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:21.112
268 of them were black.
About 680 African-Americans

00:27:21.112 --> 00:27:25.081
served in the lower houses of
state governments during

00:27:25.081 --> 00:27:29.163
Reconstruction.
Four presided as speakers of

00:27:29.163 --> 00:27:31.413
those houses.
There were 112

00:27:31.413 --> 00:27:34.633
African-Americans who served in
State Senates during

00:27:34.633 --> 00:27:37.425
Reconstruction.
There were at least 41 black

00:27:37.425 --> 00:27:40.618
sheriffs, somewhere in one of
the eleven ex-Confederate

00:27:40.618 --> 00:27:43.405
states.
There were five black mayors of

00:27:43.405 --> 00:27:45.460
Southern cities,
for awhile.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:50.187
There were 145 blacks who
served on city councils,

00:27:50.187 --> 00:27:55.863
and so on and so on.
Now this is the heart of the

00:27:55.863 --> 00:28:00.733
myth of carpetbag rule.
The claim against these people,

00:28:00.733 --> 00:28:03.144
in the South at least,
in the white South,

00:28:03.144 --> 00:28:05.319
was always they were not
prepared,

00:28:05.319 --> 00:28:08.211
they were ignorant,
all they did is sit around

00:28:08.211 --> 00:28:11.553
eating chicken bones and
spitting into gold spittoons

00:28:11.553 --> 00:28:14.059
that they bought with public
money.

00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:17.632
And if you've ever seen
Birth of a Nation,

00:28:17.632 --> 00:28:20.013
D.W.
Griffith's white supremacist

00:28:20.013 --> 00:28:22.915
epic of 1915,
he plays out that scene at

00:28:22.915 --> 00:28:26.264
great length of the black
politicians in state

00:28:26.264 --> 00:28:30.059
legislatures with their boots up
on tables,

00:28:30.059 --> 00:28:34.109
literally chewing on chicken
bones and spitting into

00:28:34.109 --> 00:28:38.080
spittoons and laughing and
playing happy darkie,

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:44.543
until the cows come home.
Now there were corrupt black

00:28:44.543 --> 00:28:49.990
politicians and there were
corrupt white politicians.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:53.351
I don't really have time to go
into all the great biographical

00:28:53.351 --> 00:28:56.492
stories of the Robert Smalls'
and the John Roy--the Robert

00:28:56.492 --> 00:28:59.358
Smalls' of South Carolina and
the John Roy Lynch's of

00:28:59.358 --> 00:29:01.729
Mississippi,
and so many others,

00:29:01.729 --> 00:29:05.576
many of whom were former
slaves, although some of them

00:29:05.576 --> 00:29:09.220
had been free before the war,
by their own purchase,

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.140
by manumission,
by other means.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.638
Some of them,
only a small percentage,

00:29:13.638 --> 00:29:17.690
were northern-born blacks who
moved south, like Hiram Revels,

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:21.269
and eventually got himself
elected to the Senate.

00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:26.080
By the way, just recently--well
I guess it was about eight years

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:30.585
ago--when the Republicans had
control of the Senate they put

00:29:30.585 --> 00:29:33.179
up a portrait,
for the first time,

00:29:33.179 --> 00:29:35.704
of Hiram Revels;
our modern Republican Party

00:29:35.704 --> 00:29:38.650
wanted to claim him.
He was a Republican;

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:43.835
so were they, by name.
But anyway there is now today a

00:29:43.835 --> 00:29:46.987
portrait of Hiram Revels.
It took a century,

00:29:46.987 --> 00:29:51.807
more, to get it there,
but he's finally up in the U.S.

00:29:51.807 --> 00:29:56.285
Senate, his picture.
Now the other side of this myth

00:29:56.285 --> 00:30:01.210
of carpetbag rule--and I want to
be a little speedy about this,

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:03.542
but it's also very
important--again,

00:30:03.542 --> 00:30:07.408
the story, the deep myth that
set into American culture for

00:30:07.408 --> 00:30:11.074
generations is that all these
Reconstruction governments

00:30:11.074 --> 00:30:14.539
really were a bunch of Yankees
who came south,

00:30:14.539 --> 00:30:17.829
got themselves elected with
black votes and ran these

00:30:17.829 --> 00:30:20.740
governments and oppressed white
Southerners.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.751
So who were these
carpetbaggers,

00:30:22.751 --> 00:30:25.165
so called?
The term got into our language,

00:30:25.165 --> 00:30:28.225
and now today anybody who grows
up in one state but somehow

00:30:28.225 --> 00:30:30.599
moves to another and tries to
get elected,

00:30:30.599 --> 00:30:33.585
as Hilary Clinton did in New
York, and there are plenty of

00:30:33.585 --> 00:30:35.890
other examples,
is labeled a carpetbagger,

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:40.587
at least for ten years or so,
until she's lived there long

00:30:40.587 --> 00:30:45.532
enough and gets reelected and I
guess--I guess you got to get

00:30:45.532 --> 00:30:49.900
reelected before you're no
longer a carpetbagger.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.645
Well, many of these Northerners
who went south were former Union

00:30:53.645 --> 00:30:56.730
soldiers.
Most of them went before 1867

00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:01.675
and '68, before these Radical
Republican regimes were put in

00:31:01.675 --> 00:31:04.490
place.
They went to become farmers.

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:07.440
They went because the land was
so cheap.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.339
And some of them went because
they liked the climate.

00:31:10.339 --> 00:31:15.753
There were New Hampshirites who
went to Mississippi because it

00:31:15.753 --> 00:31:18.188
was warm.
Some carpetbaggers were

00:31:18.188 --> 00:31:22.498
industrialists and investors.
They saw the South now as the

00:31:22.498 --> 00:31:25.529
place to invest.
It obviously was.

00:31:25.529 --> 00:31:29.900
It was prostrate,
and it needed money.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.373
Some were federal agents,
Freedmen's Bureau agents who

00:31:32.373 --> 00:31:34.879
stayed and lived there.
Many were teachers,

00:31:34.879 --> 00:31:38.685
some who stayed and lived,
if they survived and weren't

00:31:38.685 --> 00:31:40.895
killed.
Some were political

00:31:40.895 --> 00:31:45.490
opportunists and some were
adventurers and n'er-do-wells.

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.843
And I'll never forget,
as long as I live,

00:31:47.843 --> 00:31:51.196
one of the best friends I have
in the world is a Methodist

00:31:51.196 --> 00:31:55.079
minister in Chicago who grew up
in Mississippi and East Texas,

00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:57.976
Gene Winkler,
and a positively--he's one of

00:31:57.976 --> 00:32:01.079
the best read human beings I've
ever known.

00:32:01.079 --> 00:32:03.890
He reads more about the Civil
War than I do.

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:06.680
I used to actually ask him what
I should be reading.

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.433
His real job is being a
minister but he spent most of

00:32:09.433 --> 00:32:12.159
his time reading.
And he was one of the most

00:32:12.159 --> 00:32:15.069
politically radical people I've
ever known.

00:32:15.069 --> 00:32:19.559
He was still trying to be a
socialist during Reaganism.

00:32:19.559 --> 00:32:24.839
But one day I asked Gene,
"Gene, why do you keep that

00:32:24.839 --> 00:32:29.001
picture of Stonewall Jackson and
Robert E.

00:32:29.001 --> 00:32:32.859
Lee in the corner of your
office?"

00:32:32.859 --> 00:32:36.730
He said, "You know,
I'm not exactly sure.

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:42.113
It's probably because
carpetbaggers killed my

00:32:42.113 --> 00:32:44.999
great-granddaddy."
[Laughter]

00:32:44.999 --> 00:32:47.020
I don't think he said god-damn
carpetbaggers;

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:51.388
he's a good Methodist.
"Carpetbaggers killed my

00:32:51.388 --> 00:32:57.410
great-granddaddy."
I said, "Oh, oh okay."

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:01.276
[Laughter]
Like so many Southerners,

00:33:01.276 --> 00:33:07.795
he was a complicated mixture of
memories and--well enough on

00:33:07.795 --> 00:33:10.959
Gene.
I actually got the thrill some

00:33:10.959 --> 00:33:14.936
years ago to write an essay,
epilogue to Fitz Brundage's

00:33:14.936 --> 00:33:19.130
book of essays called Where
These Memories Grow,

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.080
about southern memory,
and I opened the piece with

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.851
that very story,
and I was always worried about

00:33:24.851 --> 00:33:27.200
how Gene was going to interpret
it.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.630
And he, thank God,
liked it, I think.

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:36.326
Anyway.
At no time did carpetbaggers

00:33:36.326 --> 00:33:41.333
ever make up anywhere near a
majority of any southern

00:33:41.333 --> 00:33:45.569
legislature in the
ex-Confederate states.

00:33:45.569 --> 00:33:49.911
Their goals tended to be
financial, economic,

00:33:49.911 --> 00:33:54.414
and to some extent political.
And then there's this other

00:33:54.414 --> 00:33:56.500
kind of Southerner,
the white indigenous

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.894
Southerner,
the native born white

00:33:58.894 --> 00:34:03.200
Southerner, known to history,
of course, as Scalawags,

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.940
who joined the Republican
Party, who became part of these

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:11.141
Reconstruction regimes,
who said give up the past,

00:34:11.141 --> 00:34:15.717
give up the old cause,
and they often became the

00:34:15.717 --> 00:34:21.267
object of the ire and the hatred
and the violence of white

00:34:21.267 --> 00:34:27.330
vigilante groups,
as readily as anyone else.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:30.930
Now what was a Scalawag?

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:44.597
Let me tell you the ways.
Hold on, sorry,

00:34:44.597 --> 00:34:50.431
forgive me, got it.
So a Scalwag is,

00:34:50.431 --> 00:34:54.671
by the way, a runty little
horse--that's actually what it

00:34:54.671 --> 00:34:58.760
means if you look it up--it's a
runty little horse,

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.104
a kind of useless little horse
that doesn't work very well for

00:35:01.104 --> 00:35:04.955
you, just gets in the way,
stinks and smells and doesn't

00:35:04.955 --> 00:35:08.884
pay his way.
"Our Scalawag is the local

00:35:08.884 --> 00:35:15.181
leper of the community," wrote a
Tuscaloosa, Alabama newspaper

00:35:15.181 --> 00:35:19.389
editor in 1869.
"Unlike the carpetbagger he is

00:35:19.389 --> 00:35:22.210
native, which is so much the
worse.

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:26.081
Once he was respected in his
circle, his head was level,

00:35:26.081 --> 00:35:29.250
and he would look his neighbor
in the face.

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:34.179
Now, possessed of the itch of
office and the sought room of

00:35:34.179 --> 00:35:38.678
radicalism, he is a mangy dog,
slinking through the alleys,

00:35:38.678 --> 00:35:42.615
haunting the governor's office,
defiling with tobacco juice the

00:35:42.615 --> 00:35:46.923
steps of the capitol,
stretching his lazy carcass in

00:35:46.923 --> 00:35:52.490
the sun on the square or the
benches of the mayor's court."

00:35:52.490 --> 00:36:00.594
That's relatively direct.
Scalwags were considered,

00:36:00.594 --> 00:36:02.780
in other words,
turncoats.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:06.119
Now, they had a variety of
social backgrounds.

00:36:06.119 --> 00:36:09.278
Some were sort of former
nobodies but most of them were

00:36:09.278 --> 00:36:12.788
actually quite prominent people,
like the wartime Confederate

00:36:12.788 --> 00:36:14.484
Governor of Georgia,
Joseph E.

00:36:14.484 --> 00:36:17.408
Brown, who said "give up the
cause," and joined the

00:36:17.408 --> 00:36:21.417
Republican Party after the war.
Perhaps most famous of all,

00:36:21.417 --> 00:36:24.424
James Longstreet,
Lee's second in command in the

00:36:24.424 --> 00:36:27.682
last two years of the war,
Longstreet of Georgia,

00:36:27.682 --> 00:36:31.506
moved out to Louisiana after
the war, embraced the Republican

00:36:31.506 --> 00:36:34.250
Party,
said the war had settled

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:38.050
something and Southerners had to
face it.

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:40.500
And he became a railroad
president.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:44.172
And he even for awhile
commanded U.S.

00:36:44.172 --> 00:36:49.579
troops in Louisiana who tried
to kill off the Klan.

00:36:49.579 --> 00:36:52.500
There are many,
many other examples.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:56.120
There's James Settle of North
Carolina.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.802
He's one of my favorites.
These were fascinating people,

00:37:00.802 --> 00:37:04.212
courageous people.
Settle of North Carolina had

00:37:04.212 --> 00:37:06.519
been a member of the Confederate
Congress.

00:37:06.519 --> 00:37:10.455
He'd been a big player in
Confederate politics in North

00:37:10.455 --> 00:37:13.590
Carolina, but after the war he
said this.

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:17.413
"The war had brought a general
breaking up," he said,

00:37:17.413 --> 00:37:21.264
"of old ideas.
Taking a new start in the world

00:37:21.264 --> 00:37:25.059
we are, if we are ever to have
prosperity."

00:37:25.059 --> 00:37:27.569
And then he concluded,
"I tell you,

00:37:27.569 --> 00:37:31.629
Yankees and Yankee notions are
just what we want in this

00:37:31.629 --> 00:37:34.640
country now.
We want their capital to build

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.019
factories and workshops and
railroads.

00:37:37.019 --> 00:37:40.796
We want their intelligence,
their energy and enterprise to

00:37:40.796 --> 00:37:44.110
operate factories and to teach
us how to do it."

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:52.150
Settle nearly was killed for
his views, his actions;

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:56.710
his political actions in
particular.

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:58.898
There are many other examples.
Amos T.

00:37:58.898 --> 00:38:03.454
Akerman in Georgia,
among others--look up him in

00:38:03.454 --> 00:38:07.776
Foner if you like.
Now I guess the only other

00:38:07.776 --> 00:38:12.436
thing I want to say about that
is there were carpetbag

00:38:12.436 --> 00:38:15.127
governors.
There were northern born

00:38:15.127 --> 00:38:18.544
Republicans who ended up
governors of southern states,

00:38:18.544 --> 00:38:20.897
several of them.
There were northern born

00:38:20.897 --> 00:38:22.682
members of southern state
legislatures,

00:38:22.682 --> 00:38:28.936
some black,
some white, and they became,

00:38:28.936 --> 00:38:38.531
in many instances,
the most ready targets of what

00:38:38.531 --> 00:38:49.100
was to come.
Now, I don't now how well you

00:38:49.100 --> 00:39:01.369
can see this painting,
I'll try to blow it up.

00:39:01.369 --> 00:39:04.360
It doesn't have a date on it,
unfortunately.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:08.883
I need to figure that out.
It is entitled

00:39:08.883 --> 00:39:13.559
"Disfranchisement," which is an
interesting title.

00:39:13.559 --> 00:39:18.302
If you can see on the right,
you can see about every kind of

00:39:18.302 --> 00:39:22.813
image of a bitter,
angry, hate in the eyes,

00:39:22.813 --> 00:39:30.191
Southerner, some sitting on the
cannon, others in Ku Klux Klan

00:39:30.191 --> 00:39:33.215
robes and masks,
all of them,

00:39:33.215 --> 00:39:35.937
of course, looking at the lone
black freedman,

00:39:35.937 --> 00:39:39.203
who on your first look almost
looks like he's holding a

00:39:39.203 --> 00:39:41.362
machete,
but he's not,

00:39:41.362 --> 00:39:46.460
he's holding a voting roll.
Now, the southern white

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:50.556
counter-revolution,
the move towards southern

00:39:50.556 --> 00:39:53.262
redemption,
which simply means,

00:39:53.262 --> 00:39:57.027
of course, the southern
Democratic Party taking back

00:39:57.027 --> 00:40:02.123
control of their states,
between 1870 and 1876,

00:40:02.123 --> 00:40:10.162
is rooted in their hatred,
their resentment of the rise of

00:40:10.162 --> 00:40:16.510
black political and economic
independence.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:20.693
Now, but first of all,
go with me back to Washington,

00:40:20.693 --> 00:40:23.670
and then we'll end,
at least today,

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:27.534
back on the ground in the South
and try to understand where some

00:40:27.534 --> 00:40:32.844
of this violence is coming from.
The Fifteenth Amendment passed

00:40:32.844 --> 00:40:39.079
Congress, the Fifteenth now,
passed Congress in the spring,

00:40:39.079 --> 00:40:41.659
late spring,
of 1869.

00:40:41.659 --> 00:40:48.019
It's right after Ulysses S.
Grant is inaugurated president.

00:40:48.019 --> 00:40:51.300
He's elected in the fall,
inaugurated in the spring.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:55.667
By 1868, eleven of the
twenty-one northern states still

00:40:55.667 --> 00:40:58.659
denied the right to vote to
blacks.

00:40:58.659 --> 00:41:01.559
You'll remember,
Republicans are stepping around

00:41:01.559 --> 00:41:04.273
this question of black suffrage
in the North,

00:41:04.273 --> 00:41:07.050
but they want to plant it into
the South.

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:10.498
But the trick was,
what kind of amendment would it

00:41:10.498 --> 00:41:13.713
be?
This is the great Voting Rights

00:41:13.713 --> 00:41:15.988
Amendment.
They went through three

00:41:15.988 --> 00:41:18.777
versions of the Fifteenth
Amendment--look this up in

00:41:18.777 --> 00:41:20.699
Foner,
make sure you understand

00:41:20.699 --> 00:41:23.796
it--they went through three
versions in the debate in

00:41:23.796 --> 00:41:27.191
Congress as to what kind of
voting rights amendment to put

00:41:27.191 --> 00:41:30.829
in the Constitution.
The first version--and they

00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:35.685
went from most conservative to
most radical--the first version

00:41:35.685 --> 00:41:40.780
forbade states the right to deny
suffrage on grounds of race,

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:45.710
color or previous condition of
servitude;

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:49.943
that's all it said.
That's the most conservative

00:41:49.943 --> 00:41:52.760
version.
The second version would've

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:57.222
forbade states to impose
literacy, property or nativity

00:41:57.222 --> 00:41:59.814
qualifications;
in other words,

00:41:59.814 --> 00:42:03.421
that whole array of
qualifications tests that will

00:42:03.421 --> 00:42:06.218
ultimately be used,
all over the South,

00:42:06.218 --> 00:42:09.090
to prevent black folk from
voting;

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:12.679
and to some extent poor white
folk.

00:42:12.679 --> 00:42:16.609
And then there was a third
version which simply would've

00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:20.966
affirmed simply that all male
citizens twenty-one years of age

00:42:20.966 --> 00:42:24.110
and older had the right to vote,
period.

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:27.592
Now, they debated and debated
but the one they passed,

00:42:27.592 --> 00:42:31.236
of course, was the first one,
the most conservative,

00:42:31.236 --> 00:42:35.617
the one that made absolutely no
mention of the possibility of

00:42:35.617 --> 00:42:39.780
qualifications tests.
And so the Fifteenth Amendment

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:43.957
has two kinds of impact,
two great importances if you

00:42:43.957 --> 00:42:46.172
want.
One is that it was passed at

00:42:46.172 --> 00:42:48.699
all, and it's hugely important,
but the other,

00:42:48.699 --> 00:42:51.961
of course,
is it was a very conservative

00:42:51.961 --> 00:42:57.113
compromise amendment that left
the door open to all kinds of

00:42:57.113 --> 00:43:01.571
machinations,
over time, in states,

00:43:01.571 --> 00:43:08.860
at the local level,
about qualifications to vote.

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:16.258
It passed the House of
Representatives in March,

00:43:16.258 --> 00:43:20.193
1869.
It finally was ratified by

00:43:20.193 --> 00:43:25.533
two-thirds of the state
legislatures in the United

00:43:25.533 --> 00:43:31.199
States, a full year later,
in the spring of 1870.

00:43:31.199 --> 00:43:35.784
And many people now looked at
the situation in the country,

00:43:35.784 --> 00:43:40.132
a year into Grant's presidency,
the man, the Republican,

00:43:40.132 --> 00:43:43.738
who said, "Let us have peace."
You've got the Thirteenth

00:43:43.738 --> 00:43:45.835
Amendment abolishing slavery.
You got the Fourteenth

00:43:45.835 --> 00:43:48.097
Amendment establishing
citizenship rights and equal

00:43:48.097 --> 00:43:52.003
protection before the law;
at least the beginnings of this

00:43:52.003 --> 00:43:55.099
fledgling thing called civil
rights.

00:43:55.099 --> 00:43:58.090
You got the Reconstruction Acts
in place.

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:01.254
Southern states have all been
brought back into the Union,

00:44:01.254 --> 00:44:04.141
by 1870--only Georgia was still
being sort of weirdly

00:44:04.141 --> 00:44:07.657
adjudicated,
but it finally was brought back

00:44:07.657 --> 00:44:10.947
in, in 1870.
And now comes the Voting Rights

00:44:10.947 --> 00:44:13.805
Act.
And throughout the history of

00:44:13.805 --> 00:44:18.643
modern political philosophy and
modern political history,

00:44:18.643 --> 00:44:23.739
the idea was that the vote was
the essence of democracy.

00:44:23.739 --> 00:44:28.426
And so once you've given people
the vote, on some level what

00:44:28.426 --> 00:44:33.726
else could you possibly do?
Republicans themselves now say,

00:44:33.726 --> 00:44:37.980
to themselves,
that they have established the

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.652
principle-- oh,
would that they had--of

00:44:41.652 --> 00:44:45.265
guaranteed rights,
and that they could go no

00:44:45.265 --> 00:44:46.190
further.

00:44:50.429 --> 00:44:54.256
One Republican wrote to
another, after voting for this,

00:44:54.256 --> 00:44:58.816
he said, "This is," quote,
"the last great point that

00:44:58.816 --> 00:45:03.869
remains to be settled from the
issues of the war."

00:45:03.869 --> 00:45:07.075
And Horace Greeley famously,
in his New York Herald

00:45:07.075 --> 00:45:10.739
Tribune, in April 1870,
after the ratification of the

00:45:10.739 --> 00:45:12.846
Fifteenth Amendment,
said, quote,

00:45:12.846 --> 00:45:16.073
"Let us have done with
Reconstruction"--it was the

00:45:16.073 --> 00:45:19.761
opening line under a big
headline--"Let us have done with

00:45:19.761 --> 00:45:23.948
Reconstruction.
The country is tired and sick

00:45:23.948 --> 00:45:27.500
of it.
Let us have peace."

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:35.813
"It's over, it's done," said
official Republican Party people

00:45:35.813 --> 00:45:40.878
to themselves.
And of course the white South,

00:45:40.878 --> 00:45:45.816
for two years already,
through its rising and growing

00:45:45.816 --> 00:45:50.659
Democratic Party and its violent
militant wings,

00:45:50.659 --> 00:45:53.350
is saying, "You bet
Reconstruction is over.

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:59.780
Let us show you the ways."
Now, I'm actually going to save

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:04.829
the violent story for an entire
lecture on its own;

00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:09.988
the Klan, its many actions,
examples, through the Colfax

00:46:09.988 --> 00:46:14.490
Massacre, at least,
of 1873, for next Tuesday.

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:17.681
But let me leave you with this.
What happens now,

00:46:17.681 --> 00:46:20.538
what is already happening now,
in the first Grant

00:46:20.538 --> 00:46:23.542
administration,
by 1870, is what we might

00:46:23.542 --> 00:46:28.256
simply call--it's the waning of
Radicalism, it's the waning of

00:46:28.256 --> 00:46:31.874
that civic vision,
as Foner calls it in your book,

00:46:31.874 --> 00:46:34.320
of the Radical Republicans'
ideology.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:38.730
And what was that vision?
Foner lays it all out for you.

00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:43.901
He said the Radical Republicans
had an essential ideological

00:46:43.901 --> 00:46:47.900
vision.
On the one hand it was Unionism.

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:51.319
On the other hand it was
rooted, to some extent,

00:46:51.319 --> 00:46:55.321
in trying to create racial
equality, because the war had

00:46:55.321 --> 00:46:58.449
necessitated,
it had forced it on them.

00:46:58.449 --> 00:47:01.670
They, therefore,
were believers in this idea of

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:04.750
guaranteed rights within the
Constitution.

00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:09.871
And last but not least they
were believers in positive

00:47:09.871 --> 00:47:14.139
activist central government.
And you put those three or four

00:47:14.139 --> 00:47:16.700
principles together and you've
got the package that was the

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.599
civic vision of the Radical
Republicans.

00:47:18.599 --> 00:47:23.856
But the problem is that vision
is now going to crumble as fast,

00:47:23.856 --> 00:47:28.010
almost as fast,
as it ever came into existence;

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:31.608
in fact, it's going to crumble
faster than it ever came into

00:47:31.608 --> 00:47:32.340
existence.

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:41.830
Oh I'll leave you with this.

00:47:48.469 --> 00:47:53.005
It's not just going to crumble
because Republicans sort of give

00:47:53.005 --> 00:47:55.031
up the game,
and it's not going to just

00:47:55.031 --> 00:47:56.919
crumble because Thaddeus
Stephens dies and Charles

00:47:56.919 --> 00:47:59.766
Sumner's out of the way,
and Radicals don't really run

00:47:59.766 --> 00:48:03.502
this party under Grant anymore.
It's going to crumble because

00:48:03.502 --> 00:48:07.048
of the most widespread use of
political violence in American

00:48:07.048 --> 00:48:09.105
history.
We'll return to this question

00:48:09.105 --> 00:48:11.320
next Tuesday,
but let me leave you with this.

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:16.728
There is no African-American
writer, and some white writers,

00:48:16.728 --> 00:48:20.372
worth their salt,
from the 1870s and '80s,

00:48:20.372 --> 00:48:24.177
right on through well into the
twentieth century,

00:48:24.177 --> 00:48:28.219
who could ever avert their eyes
from this story.

00:48:28.219 --> 00:48:30.766
This is a passage from James
Weldon Johnson's The

00:48:30.766 --> 00:48:33.099
Autobiography of an
Ex-Colored Man.

00:48:33.099 --> 00:48:35.879
If you've ever read that
wonderful 1912 novel,

00:48:35.879 --> 00:48:39.462
you'll know it's the story of a
black man who's passing for

00:48:39.462 --> 00:48:42.096
white,
but because he's passing in the

00:48:42.096 --> 00:48:46.260
South he gets to see things that
people don't know he's seeing.

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:51.601
And of course the book ends,
as so many books did in this

00:48:51.601 --> 00:48:55.905
time, with a lynching.
This is Ex-Colored man--he

00:48:55.905 --> 00:49:00.090
doesn't have any other
name--describing what he sees.

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:02.389
"A railroad tie was sunk into
the ground.

00:49:02.389 --> 00:49:05.660
The rope was removed and a
chain brought and securely

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:08.239
coiled around the victim and the
stake.

00:49:08.239 --> 00:49:11.050
There he stood,
a man only in form and stature.

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:14.829
His eyes were full and vacant,
indicating not a single ray of

00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:16.872
thought.
Fuel was brought from

00:49:16.872 --> 00:49:18.621
everywhere;
oil, the torch,

00:49:18.621 --> 00:49:21.950
the flames crouched for an
instant as though to gather

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:25.530
strength, then leaped up as high
as the victim's head.

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:29.150
He squirmed,
he writhed, he strained at his

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:34.840
chains, then gave out cries and
groans that I shall always hear.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:38.175
His eyes, bulging from their
sockets, rolled from side to

00:49:38.175 --> 00:49:40.260
side, appealing in vain for
help.

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:47.864
I was fixed to the spot where I
stood, powerless to take my eyes

00:49:47.864 --> 00:49:52.090
from what I did not want to
see."

00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:57.970
We have never wanted to see
what really happened in the

00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:02.000
South, in the 1870s,
but we'll try.

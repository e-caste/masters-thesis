00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:06.240
Prof: What is scripture,
and what is canon?

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.120
These are not necessarily the
same thing.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.721
When you call something
"scripture,"

00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:14.957
what you simply mean is it's
some kind of writing that is

00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:17.790
taken by somebody as holy and
authoritative,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.690
somehow sacred.
 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.629
Now, different religions--some
religions don't have what we

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:23.960
would normally think of as
scripture, in Islam,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.380
Judaism or Christianity.
 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.652
They might have lots and lots
of holy writings,

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:30.023
but they don't have a
particular, bounded body of

00:00:30.023 --> 00:00:31.900
writings that they call
scripture.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.320
They have lots of scripture.
 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.304
What makes something scripture,
though, is that it's taken to

00:00:36.304 --> 00:00:39.140
be authoritative and holy by
some particular community.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.434
Now, notice that does not
necessarily mean it's canonical

00:00:43.434 --> 00:00:47.653
because scripture in some
religions refers to a bunch of

00:00:47.653 --> 00:00:48.420
stuff.
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.790
But they don't have a set list
of things that make something

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:53.680
the canon.
 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.751
Judaism, Islam and Christianity
all have, basically,

00:00:57.751 --> 00:00:58.470
canons.
 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.890
That is it's the Qur'an for
Islam.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.078
It's the Hebrew Bible for
Judaism.

00:01:04.078 --> 00:01:06.441
And it's the Hebrew Bible,
plus the New Testament--and

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:08.360
we'll talk about some of the
other writings,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.430
too--for Christians.
 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.554
What does it mean to call
something "canon"

00:01:11.554 --> 00:01:13.230
that makes it different from
scripture?

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.426
By calling it canon,
we're saying there's an actual

00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:20.006
list that a religion body
adheres to, with books that are

00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:22.500
either in or books that are not
in.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.683
So "scripture"
can refer to any kind of

00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:27.320
writing that a bunch of people
consider holy or inspired or

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.140
authoritative.
 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.132
But when you call something
"canon,"

00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:32.747
you mean that there's a group
of writing that has boundaries

00:01:32.747 --> 00:01:33.190
to it.
 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.992
And, of course,
it just comes from the Greek

00:01:36.992 --> 00:01:41.328
word canon,
spelled with one "n,"

00:01:41.328 --> 00:01:42.390
not two.
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.050
This Greek word means a list.
 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.660
It can mean a rod, a staff.
 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.050
It can mean a measuring rod.
 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.087
And so it comes to be a list
that accounts as authoritative

00:01:51.087 --> 00:01:52.760
in early Christianity.
 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.830
So that's what it means to call
something "canonical."

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.290
When you talk about something
like the Shakespeare canon,

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.376
the canon of Shakespeare or the
canon of great Western

00:02:01.376 --> 00:02:03.896
Literature that's actually using
the term in a bit of an expanded

00:02:03.896 --> 00:02:04.290
sense.
 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.790
Because we don't really
consider Western Literature to

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.288
have an actual closed canon of
authoritative texts.

00:02:11.288 --> 00:02:14.482
In Christianity,
though, it means the list of

00:02:14.482 --> 00:02:18.545
texts that are scripture and
recognized as different from

00:02:18.545 --> 00:02:19.780
other things.
 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.159
We have to first,
also, recognize that the early

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.288
Christians,
it seems like,

00:02:23.288 --> 00:02:25.480
from the very early period,
at least a lot of them,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.780
accepted Jewish scripture as
their own.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.995
So for example,
when the Apostle Paul says,

00:02:29.995 --> 00:02:33.001
"Scripture says,"
he's not talking about the New

00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:33.740
Testament.
 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.960
He's talking about Jewish
scripture.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.985
So almost all the early
Christians, they didn't

00:02:37.985 --> 00:02:40.758
know--the people writing the New
Testament didn't know they were

00:02:40.758 --> 00:02:42.080
writing the New Testament.
 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.218
They just thought they were
writing a gospel or a sermon or

00:02:45.218 --> 00:02:47.060
a letter or something like that.
 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.819
So when you see the term
"scripture"

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.330
in the New Testament,
every time except,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.720
maybe, one time--
and we'll talk about this when

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.693
we get to it--
it refers to Jewish scripture

00:02:55.693 --> 00:02:59.169
that Christians accepted,
followers of Jesus accepted,

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:00.180
as their own.
 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.930
The oldest materials that we
have for Christianity--

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.082
and so what the lecture today
is going to be about is how did

00:03:06.082 --> 00:03:09.026
the particular twenty-seven
books that came to be the New

00:03:09.026 --> 00:03:12.310
Testament canon,
how did those get chosen?

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.939
By whom--who made the decision?
 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:15.378
When did they make the decision?
 

00:03:15.378 --> 00:03:17.158
And what were the criteria they
used?

00:03:17.158 --> 00:03:19.720
Why did they allow some books
in and other books not in?

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.989
The oldest written materials of
Christianity are actually the

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:23.970
letters of Paul.
 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.370
This may come as a surprise,
because you get to the gospels

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.568
first in the New Testament.
 

00:03:27.568 --> 00:03:29.113
And most people assume,
"Oh, the gospels,

00:03:29.113 --> 00:03:30.280
they're about the life of
Jesus.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.460
That must be the oldest
stuff."

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.448
Well, the gospels are actually
all written after the letters of

00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:36.280
Paul were written by 20 or 30
years.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.690
So the oldest material we have
are the letters of Paul.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.152
And the oldest one of those
letters is 1 Thessalonians,

00:03:44.152 --> 00:03:48.699
probably, dated to around the
year 50 or thereabouts.

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:51.105
Pretty quickly,
though, different churches,

00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:54.026
probably Paul's churches,
initially, started sending

00:03:54.026 --> 00:03:56.090
around copies of Paul's letters.
 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.190
Remember, there's no printing
press in the ancient world.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.778
Whenever your church would get
a copy of one of these letters

00:04:00.778 --> 00:04:02.490
from Paul,
you would have scribes,

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.496
often slaves,
because slaves were especially

00:04:04.496 --> 00:04:05.460
trained to be scribes.
 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.812
They would take that letter,
and they would make a copy of

00:04:07.812 --> 00:04:08.020
it.
 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.205
And then, they might keep the
original, and they'd send the

00:04:10.205 --> 00:04:11.258
copy off to somebody else.
 

00:04:11.258 --> 00:04:13.092
Or they might keep the copy and
send the original off to

00:04:13.092 --> 00:04:13.460
somebody.
 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.596
And so letters would be copied,
and books would be copied and

00:04:16.596 --> 00:04:18.740
sent around from different
communities.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.319
This obviously happened.
 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:22.559
In Colossians 4:16,
which is actually,

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:25.949
I'll argue, not written by
Paul, although it claims to be

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.160
written by Paul.
 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.480
The writer says,
"When this letter has been

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.012
read among you,
have it read,

00:04:31.012 --> 00:04:32.990
also, in the church of the
Laodiceans,

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.303
and see that you read,
also, the letter from

00:04:35.303 --> 00:04:36.220
Laodicea."
 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.199
So notice this author--who I
think is a pseudepigrapher.

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:40.910
He's writing in the name of
Paul, but not really Paul.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.673
He's saying that there's
another letter sent by Paul to

00:04:43.673 --> 00:04:44.850
the Laodicean church.
 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.954
So let them send you their
copy, and you send a copy of

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:49.220
this letter to them.
 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.838
So we quickly see that even in
the letters under Paul's name,

00:04:52.838 --> 00:04:55.129
this activity's being spread
around.

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.367
Also, we see the letter of
Ephesians--again,

00:04:57.367 --> 00:04:59.968
claims to be by Paul,
but I'll argue is not by Paul

00:04:59.968 --> 00:05:02.829
when we get to that lecture,
way into the semester.

00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:05.322
The letter to the Ephesians
looks like it was not actually

00:05:05.322 --> 00:05:06.588
written to only one church.
 

00:05:06.588 --> 00:05:09.927
It looks like it was a circular
letter meant to be circulated to

00:05:09.927 --> 00:05:11.040
different churches.
 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.439
And one of the ways we think
this--

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:15.648
one of the reasons we think
this is because in some of the

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:18.983
old manuscripts of Ephesians,
"To the Ephesians"

00:05:18.983 --> 00:05:19.750
is not there.
 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.339
It's either blank or it's to
somebody else.

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:25.151
So some scholars have suggested
that maybe the letter to the

00:05:25.151 --> 00:05:27.870
Ephesians was originally
intended as a circular letter.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.730
And, maybe, the original
writer, sort of,

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.569
even left some copies blank so
that somebody could fill in.

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:34.680
"Oh, well,
we're in Laodicea.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.952
Let's say 'To the Laodiceans,'
and we can act like Paul sent it

00:05:36.952 --> 00:05:37.649
just to us."
 

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:40.562
So the manuscript tradition
suggests that it was a letter

00:05:40.562 --> 00:05:42.589
that was a circular letter in
itself.

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:46.540
We also have imitations of
Paul's letters developing.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.392
For example,
I said, Colossians I don't

00:05:48.392 --> 00:05:50.880
think is written by Paul,
but by a disciple of Paul,

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.149
maybe after his death.
 

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:55.829
Ephesians was written by a
different disciple of Paul,

00:05:55.829 --> 00:05:59.035
and he was using as his model
for a Pauline letter the actual

00:05:59.035 --> 00:06:01.389
letters of Paul,
or at least some of them that

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:02.588
he possessed and knew of.
 

00:06:02.588 --> 00:06:04.559
But he was, also,
using the letter to the

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:05.199
Colossians.
 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.497
So notice this guy,
another guy sort of forging

00:06:08.497 --> 00:06:10.290
another letter by Paul.
 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.569
And he's using another forged
letter by Paul as his model.

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:15.959
In fact, he almost quotes it in
places.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:18.408
So we can tell that the writer
of the Ephesians seems to have

00:06:18.408 --> 00:06:19.470
been a different author.
 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.160
But he used the letter to the
Colossians as one of his models.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.319
So Paul's letters were being
imitated, new ones were being

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.649
written, and they were being
circulated.

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:32.930
Paul's letters actually became
so famous and respected,

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.089
and at least in some aspects of
early Christianity,

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:36.430
that they were called
themselves

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.470
"scripture."
 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.538
And this is the one exception I
said to when in the New

00:06:39.538 --> 00:06:41.682
Testament you see the word
scripture, it refers to Jewish

00:06:41.682 --> 00:06:42.220
scripture.
 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.663
The guy who wrote 2
Peter--again,

00:06:44.663 --> 00:06:48.302
not really Peter,
but a writer writing in Peter's

00:06:48.302 --> 00:06:50.541
name--
talked about Paul's letters as

00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:52.480
if--and he calls them scripture.
 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.420
He says, "There are many
things in Paul's letters very

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.290
difficult to understand.
 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.470
And some people twist them to
their own destruction as they do

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.649
other kinds of scripture."
 

00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:01.310
So already by the time 2 Peter
was written,

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.220
which was much later than the
letters of Paul,

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.053
Paul's letters have come to be
regarded by at least some early

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:10.379
Christians as scripture
themselves.

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:13.665
So collections of Paul's
letters were gradually being

00:07:13.665 --> 00:07:15.750
made and copied and circulated.
 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:20.153
That's the first development of
what you have a collection of

00:07:20.153 --> 00:07:24.410
what would be considered holy
writing among Christians that

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.639
was more than just the Jewish
scripture.

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:30.795
We also know,
though, about oral traditions

00:07:30.795 --> 00:07:32.300
in Paul's letters.
 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.810
And this gets us back to how
did the gospels come about?

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.540
So Paul's letters came about
that way.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.500
How did the gospels come about?
 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.149
We know that there were oral
traditions about Jesus.

00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:43.550
People would tell stories about
Jesus in their churches.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.779
Sometimes, they would tell
sayings.

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:50.024
So in Romans 12:14,
Paul says, "Bless those

00:07:50.024 --> 00:07:51.829
who persecute you.
 

00:07:51.829 --> 00:07:53.829
Bless and do not curse
them."

00:07:53.829 --> 00:07:57.579
Now, he doesn't say this is a
quotation of Jesus.

00:07:57.579 --> 00:08:01.696
But it sounds an awful lot like
you find in some of the gospels,

00:08:01.696 --> 00:08:03.199
like in Matthew 5:44.
 

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:06.267
So Paul's saying this,
probably, passing this along as

00:08:06.267 --> 00:08:07.600
a quotation of Jesus.
 

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:14.649
In 1 Corinthians 11:23-26,
here I'll read this to you.

00:08:14.649 --> 00:08:18.250
Start bringing your Bible to
class if you haven't today.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.783
Because, you know,
you can't trust me,

00:08:20.783 --> 00:08:24.961
and so you have to check me out
and make sure I'm not lying to

00:08:24.961 --> 00:08:25.509
you.
 

00:08:25.509 --> 00:08:27.011
Oh, I should do this,
now, perhaps,

00:08:27.011 --> 00:08:28.910
since it's the beginning of the
semester.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:40.226
The official motto of the
class--you have to memorize

00:08:40.226 --> 00:08:48.279
this: de omnibus
dubitandum.

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:49.799
Say it with me, please.
 

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:50.996
De omnibus du…
Students:

00:08:50.996 --> 00:08:52.039
 De omnibus
dubitandum.

00:08:52.039 --> 00:08:53.250
Prof: With feeling.
 

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.075
De omni…
Students:

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:55.440
 De omnibus
dubitandum.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.850
Prof: About twice as
loud.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.219
Students:
De omnibus

00:08:58.219 --> 00:09:00.879
dubitandum.
Prof: Write it down.

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:02.860
Say it tonight,
before you go to sleep.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.788
Say it in the morning,
when you wake.

00:09:05.788 --> 00:09:08.070
Every day of the semester say
it before you go to sleep.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.178
Say it when you wake.
 

00:09:09.178 --> 00:09:12.529
Can anybody tell me what it
means?

00:09:12.529 --> 00:09:14.799
"Doubt everything."
 

00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:17.570
Doubt everything.
 

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.000
Okay.
 

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.566
And that includes me,
because I'm going to lie to you

00:09:22.566 --> 00:09:24.350
a lot all semester long.
 

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.928
Or, at least,
somebody will accuse me of that

00:09:26.928 --> 00:09:27.750
I guarantee.
 

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:28.379
Okay.
 

00:09:28.379 --> 00:09:30.864
1 Corinthians 11,
if you've got your Bible follow

00:09:30.864 --> 00:09:32.210
along with me,
verse 23.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.288
"For I received from the
Lord," Paul says,

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:42.649
"what I also handed on to
you,

00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:45.558
that the Lord Jesus on the
night when he was betrayed took

00:09:45.558 --> 00:09:47.716
a loaf of bread,
and when he had given thanks,

00:09:47.716 --> 00:09:50.491
he broke it and said,
'This is my body that is for

00:09:50.491 --> 00:09:50.820
you.
 

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.529
Do this in remembrance of me.'
 

00:09:52.529 --> 00:09:54.293
In the same way,
he took the cup,

00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:57.327
also, after supper saying,
'This cup is the new covenant

00:09:57.327 --> 00:09:58.210
in my blood.
 

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.230
Do this as often as you drink
it in remembrance of me.'

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.874
For as often as you eat this
bread and drink the cup,

00:10:03.874 --> 00:10:06.570
you proclaim the Lord's death
until he comes."

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:07.889
Where did Paul get this?
 

00:10:07.889 --> 00:10:10.950
He says, "I gave it to you
as I received it myself."

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.403
This is traditional Greek
language of passing on

00:10:13.403 --> 00:10:14.028
tradition.
 

00:10:14.028 --> 00:10:16.434
So Paul knows he's passing on a
bit of tradition,

00:10:16.434 --> 00:10:18.389
very, very early Christian
tradition.

00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:22.090
But Paul was not a disciple of
Jesus during Jesus' lifetime.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:24.798
Paul never saw Jesus,
except in his visions.

00:10:24.798 --> 00:10:28.621
Paul saw Jesus in apocalyptic
visions, but he never saw Jesus'

00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:29.750
flesh and blood.
 

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.230
And so Paul was not his
disciple.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.950
He must have gotten this from
other disciples of Jesus.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.149
So what does this tell us?
 

00:10:36.149 --> 00:10:39.195
This tells us that different
disciples of Jesus were

00:10:39.195 --> 00:10:42.956
remembering some of his sayings
and passing them around to other

00:10:42.956 --> 00:10:44.509
people after his life.
 

00:10:44.509 --> 00:10:47.769
Now, the first time--well,
also, there's another

00:10:47.769 --> 00:10:50.615
interesting passage in 1
Corinthians 9:14,

00:10:50.615 --> 00:10:52.350
where Paul says this.
 

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.980
"In the same way,
the Lord commanded that those

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.712
who proclaim the gospel should
get their living by the

00:10:57.712 --> 00:10:58.590
gospel."
 

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:02.971
Now, we actually don't have a
saying in the Gospels that Jesus

00:11:02.971 --> 00:11:04.480
actually says that.
 

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:09.000
It does sound a little bit
like, maybe, Luke 10:7.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.501
But this is a saying that Paul
attributes to Jesus that's not

00:11:12.501 --> 00:11:14.019
actually in our gospels.
 

00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:15.864
It also shows,
though--it's interesting,

00:11:15.864 --> 00:11:18.606
too, that Paul says preachers
should make their living from

00:11:18.606 --> 00:11:19.788
preaching the gospel.
 

00:11:19.788 --> 00:11:22.660
That is, churches should
support the preachers and

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.538
missionaries.
 

00:11:23.538 --> 00:11:25.649
Paul says that's a command from
Jesus.

00:11:25.649 --> 00:11:26.619
He, actually,
doesn't obey it,

00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:26.918
though.
 

00:11:26.918 --> 00:11:29.687
Because he makes the point that
he, himself, is not going to

00:11:29.687 --> 00:11:31.798
take money from his churches at
that point.

00:11:31.798 --> 00:11:34.445
So the earliest Gospel,
though, that pulled together

00:11:34.445 --> 00:11:37.610
some of these things that we
possess is the Gospel of Mark.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.740
It probably was written around
the year 70.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.714
And in the next couple of
lectures I'll show you why we

00:11:43.714 --> 00:11:47.239
think we can pinpoint around the
date that the gospel of Mark was

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:47.899
written.
 

00:11:47.899 --> 00:11:50.129
It's a very interesting little
process.

00:11:50.129 --> 00:11:53.379
Then, Matthew and Luke were
both written after Mark,

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:55.418
and they used Mark as sources.
 

00:11:55.418 --> 00:11:58.090
When you get to the discussion
section on the synoptic problem,

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.908
which is your first discussion
section,

00:11:59.908 --> 00:12:02.947
you'll learn all this theory
about the relationship between

00:12:02.947 --> 00:12:04.308
Matthew, Mark,
and Luke.

00:12:04.308 --> 00:12:06.667
Who was written first,
who copied whom,

00:12:06.667 --> 00:12:09.149
who used whom,
and that sort of thing.

00:12:09.149 --> 00:12:11.678
The beginning of Luke,
though, starts off like this.

00:12:11.678 --> 00:12:13.690
"Since many have
undertaken to set down an

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.269
orderly account of the events
that have been fulfilled among

00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:18.009
us,
just as they were handed on to

00:12:18.009 --> 00:12:20.559
us by those who from the
beginning were eyewitnesses and

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:22.889
servants of the word,
I, too, decided after

00:12:22.889 --> 00:12:26.009
investigating everything
carefully from the very first to

00:12:26.009 --> 00:12:28.070
write an orderly account for
you,

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.630
most excellent Theophilus,
so that you may know the truth

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.649
concerning the things about what
you have been instructed."

00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:36.070
Now, what does that tell us?
 

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.529
That tells us that whoever
wrote the Gospel of Luke--

00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:41.210
and again, I'll tell you that
it wasn't the historical person

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.129
called Luke,
who's a companion of Paul,

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:43.610
probably.
 

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:47.279
But whoever wrote this says
that he did some research.

00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:49.279
He collected other sayings
about Jesus.

00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:50.580
He even looked at other written
accounts.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.168
And from those different
things, he, himself,

00:12:53.168 --> 00:12:54.700
compiled his own gospel.
 

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.730
So we can tell that the gospels
start off with oral tradition

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.561
that's being passed around,
different sayings and stories

00:13:00.561 --> 00:13:01.370
about Jesus.
 

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.264
And then, gradually,
but only about 40 years after

00:13:04.264 --> 00:13:07.041
the death of Jesus,
the Gospel of Mark is in the

00:13:07.041 --> 00:13:07.750
year 70.
 

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.610
If Jesus was crucified around
the year 30 that's a 40 year

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:13.721
period of time between the death
of Jesus and the appearance of

00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:15.580
the first gospel that we
possess.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.793
Although there were other
written materials being passed

00:13:17.793 --> 00:13:18.840
around during that time.
 

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.809
Now, what does this say about
this?

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.356
Some of this--we tend to think,
as modern people,

00:13:31.356 --> 00:13:34.558
that a written text is actually
the best thing.

00:13:34.558 --> 00:13:38.899
It's better than just rumor or
hearsay or oral tradition.

00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:41.230
It's interesting,
though, that some ancient

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:42.730
people didn't think that.
 

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.929
In fact, there's a guy named
Papias.

00:13:44.929 --> 00:13:46.070
He's on your handout.
 

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:51.371
He was a Christian leader who
lived, probably wrote about some

00:13:51.371 --> 00:13:55.110
of this stuff around the year
130 or 140.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.544
And he says this about his own
little research:

00:13:58.544 --> 00:14:02.503
"I shall not hesitate to
put down for you with my

00:14:02.503 --> 00:14:06.534
interpretations whatsoever
things I well learned at one

00:14:06.534 --> 00:14:11.389
time from the Presbyters,"
just meaning the old guys,

00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:13.028
elders, "and well
remembered,

00:14:13.028 --> 00:14:14.940
confidently asserting
truthfulness for them.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.389
For I did not take pleasure as
the multitude does in those who

00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:20.764
say many things,
but in those who teach the

00:14:20.764 --> 00:14:22.178
things that are true.
 

00:14:22.178 --> 00:14:24.696
Nor did I take pleasure in
those who recall strange

00:14:24.696 --> 00:14:26.714
commands,
but in those who recall the

00:14:26.714 --> 00:14:29.855
commands given by the Lord to
the Faith and coming from Truth

00:14:29.855 --> 00:14:30.379
itself.
 

00:14:30.379 --> 00:14:31.649
But if, per chance,
there came, also,

00:14:31.649 --> 00:14:34.654
anyone who had followed the
Presbyters,"

00:14:34.654 --> 00:14:37.226
the elders,
"I made inquiry concerning

00:14:37.226 --> 00:14:40.553
the words of the Presbyters,
what Andrew or what Peter had

00:14:40.553 --> 00:14:42.428
said,
or what Philip or what Thomas

00:14:42.428 --> 00:14:44.105
or James,
or what John or Matthew,

00:14:44.105 --> 00:14:46.360
or any of the other disciples
of the Lord said.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.578
And what things Aristeon and
the Presbyter John,

00:14:48.578 --> 00:14:50.279
disciples of the Lord used to
say.

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:53.505
For I did not suppose that the
things from the books would aid

00:14:53.505 --> 00:14:56.202
me, so much as things from the
living and continuing

00:14:56.202 --> 00:14:57.048
voice."
 

00:14:57.048 --> 00:14:58.870
Notice what Papias says he's
doing.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.440
He doesn't interview the actual
apostles.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.918
He's too long after their death.
 

00:15:03.918 --> 00:15:07.940
But he tries to find people who
are old men, who knew the

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:08.730
apostles.
 

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:12.355
And he says he questioned them
about what they said Jesus had

00:15:12.355 --> 00:15:12.778
said.
 

00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:14.163
That's interesting,
because it shows this

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:14.960
continuing tradition.
 

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.220
But it's also interesting that
he says he trusted that

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.418
traditional living voice more
than he trusted written

00:15:21.418 --> 00:15:22.278
documents.
 

00:15:22.278 --> 00:15:25.610
So that's important to keep in
mind.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.714
The next time we see some
development in how this New

00:15:27.714 --> 00:15:30.264
Testament starts coming about is
around the middle of the second

00:15:30.264 --> 00:15:30.750
century.
 

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:32.528
We have a guy named Justin
Martyr.

00:15:32.528 --> 00:15:35.856
He's called that because he was
martyred for the faith around

00:15:35.856 --> 00:15:36.690
the year 150.
 

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:40.009
He mentions "the memoirs
of the apostles."

00:15:40.009 --> 00:15:41.508
We think he's,
probably, talking about the

00:15:41.508 --> 00:15:42.932
gospels,
but he doesn't actually use

00:15:42.932 --> 00:15:45.168
that term as much as he talks
about "the memoirs of the

00:15:45.168 --> 00:15:45.850
apostles."
 

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.720
So he knows that there's
written documents.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.136
We also know that around this
time there are several different

00:15:51.136 --> 00:15:54.048
things being passed around that
look like gospels.

00:15:54.048 --> 00:15:56.317
There is Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John,

00:15:56.317 --> 00:15:57.808
which are in our bible.
 

00:15:57.808 --> 00:16:00.817
But there's also the Gospel of
Thomas that we know about very

00:16:00.817 --> 00:16:01.370
early on.
 

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:05.153
And then, you've heard the news
about the Gospel of Judas being

00:16:05.153 --> 00:16:07.350
discovered recently and
published.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.158
So there's a Gospel of Mary.
 

00:16:09.158 --> 00:16:12.101
There are several other gospels
that are floating around the

00:16:12.101 --> 00:16:12.950
second century.
 

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.110
So that's how these written
documents came about.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.558
How did they settle on these
four, though?

00:16:17.558 --> 00:16:20.649
First, then,
we have to talk about Marcion.

00:16:20.649 --> 00:16:24.090
I think he's on your handout,
is that correct?

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:27.048
Yes, Marcion,
who died around 160.

00:16:27.048 --> 00:16:30.912
Marcion was this guy from Asia
Minor, modern day Turkey,

00:16:30.912 --> 00:16:33.230
and just get used to that term.
 

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.179
Because whenever we say,
"Asia Minor,"

00:16:35.179 --> 00:16:37.504
we're talking about that
section around the Mediterranean

00:16:37.504 --> 00:16:38.750
that now is called Turkey.
 

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.580
But it was called Asia Minor,
generally, in the Roman

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:42.558
Imperial Period.
 

00:16:42.558 --> 00:16:45.788
Marcion came to Rome from Asia
Minor.

00:16:45.788 --> 00:16:48.178
He seemed to be a successful
businessman, a ship builder.

00:16:48.178 --> 00:16:50.649
He gave the Roman church a huge
sum of money.

00:16:50.649 --> 00:16:52.908
And so he got a lot of honor.
 

00:16:52.908 --> 00:16:56.043
But then, he started teaching
some doctrines that struck other

00:16:56.043 --> 00:16:58.460
Christians in Rome as being a
little bit off.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.932
For one thing,
Marcion said that the God,

00:17:00.932 --> 00:17:04.579
who's mentioned in the Jewish
scripture, the God who created

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:07.608
the earth, is not the father of
Jesus Christ.

00:17:07.608 --> 00:17:10.519
He's a bungling or evil or bad
god.

00:17:10.519 --> 00:17:12.480
He gave all these people these
bad rules.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.009
And he punished them if they
didn't obey the rules.

00:17:15.009 --> 00:17:18.135
That's not the God that Jesus
talked about as being the God of

00:17:18.135 --> 00:17:19.519
grace and love and mercy.
 

00:17:19.519 --> 00:17:23.190
So he said, "That God is
not the father of Jesus Christ.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.950
That's not the God that Jesus
was talking about.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.598
So what we need to do is throw
away Jewish scripture."

00:17:28.598 --> 00:17:31.440
So he said, "Christians
don't need Jewish scripture.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.769
That's all about a wrong god
anyway.

00:17:33.769 --> 00:17:34.680
It's about a false god.
 

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.759
We don't need that.
 

00:17:35.759 --> 00:17:37.680
What we need,"
he said, "is the

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.400
gospel."
 

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.930
And in fact,
he chose one of these gospels.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:42.328
He took the Gospel of Luke.
 

00:17:42.328 --> 00:17:44.180
Why did he take the Gospel of
Luke?

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.640
Because he believed Luke had
been a companion of Paul.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.358
And Luke correctly passed on
Paul's gospel.

00:17:51.358 --> 00:17:55.420
Because Paul was Marcion's
fave, fave apostle.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.460
Marcion believed that Paul had
been the only one of the

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.598
different apostles who got it
right.

00:18:00.598 --> 00:18:03.221
Because he taught people,
"You don't have to obey

00:18:03.221 --> 00:18:04.358
the Jewish law."
 

00:18:04.358 --> 00:18:06.385
In fact, he taught people,
"You shouldn't obey the

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:07.098
Jewish law."
 

00:18:07.098 --> 00:18:09.420
So Marcion said,
"Paul got it right."

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.150
He threw out the Old Testament.
 

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.626
He threw out the Jewish God,
and he introduced the correct

00:18:13.626 --> 00:18:14.410
gospel of Jesus.
 

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.460
And Luke recorded that in his
gospel.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.109
So Marcion said the only thing
that should be scripture for us

00:18:19.109 --> 00:18:20.500
is not all that Jewish
scripture.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.368
Get rid of that.
 

00:18:21.368 --> 00:18:24.588
We just need the ten letters of
Paul that he knew about.

00:18:24.588 --> 00:18:26.792
Now, there are actually
thirteen letters of Paul--that

00:18:26.792 --> 00:18:28.288
claim to be by Paul--in our
bible.

00:18:28.288 --> 00:18:30.970
Marcion seemed to know only ten
of them.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.728
That might be interesting later
on in the semester,

00:18:33.728 --> 00:18:34.058
too.
 

00:18:34.058 --> 00:18:37.920
But he seemed to only include
ten letters in his list.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.298
So the ten letters of Paul,
and Luke.

00:18:40.298 --> 00:18:42.486
Now, you may have noticed if
you've actually read any of the

00:18:42.486 --> 00:18:44.442
letters of Paul,
and the Gospel of Luke,

00:18:44.442 --> 00:18:47.330
that these people seem to
believe that the creator God

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:50.655
mentioned in Jewish scripture
actually was the father of Jesus

00:18:50.655 --> 00:18:51.308
Christ.
 

00:18:51.308 --> 00:18:53.759
Marcion noticed some of those
places, too, like when Paul

00:18:53.759 --> 00:18:55.509
seemed to be quoting Jewish
scripture.

00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:56.930
So Marcion said, "Aha.
 

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.306
The other Jewish apostles,
the bad apostles,

00:18:59.306 --> 00:19:00.910
got hold of Paul's letters.
 

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:03.576
And they got hold of the Gospel
of Luke, and they adulterated

00:19:03.576 --> 00:19:03.798
it.
 

00:19:03.798 --> 00:19:05.150
They put all this other stuff
in."

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:08.508
So Marcion claimed that he
could edit out all the added

00:19:08.508 --> 00:19:12.240
stuff out of Paul's letters and
out of the Gospel of Luke.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.112
And this edited version of the
Gospel of Luke and the ten

00:19:16.112 --> 00:19:19.223
letters of Paul,
that's what Marcion published

00:19:19.223 --> 00:19:20.400
as his canon.
 

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.080
This is the first time we have
in Christianity someone

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.483
attempting to say,
"This is the authoritative

00:19:27.483 --> 00:19:28.108
list.
 

00:19:28.108 --> 00:19:31.890
And all these other things are
not part of the list."

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:34.665
Marcion, who came to be
considered a heretic by orthodox

00:19:34.665 --> 00:19:37.442
Christians--remember that at
this time, there's a lot of

00:19:37.442 --> 00:19:39.259
different kinds of Christianity.
 

00:19:39.259 --> 00:19:42.058
So how do you tell an orthodox
Christian from a heretical

00:19:42.058 --> 00:19:42.660
Christian?
 

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.480
Well, it's your judgment call
or mine in the second century.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.993
You hadn't had,
yet, the creeds that would try

00:19:46.993 --> 00:19:49.047
to settle these things for good,
like you did in the third and

00:19:49.047 --> 00:19:50.358
fourth century--the fourth
century.

00:19:50.358 --> 00:19:53.057
But a lot of Christians in
Rome, the Bishop of Rome,

00:19:53.057 --> 00:19:55.702
a lot of other people,
considered Marcion a heretic

00:19:55.702 --> 00:19:56.390
for this.
 

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:58.068
They kicked him out of the
church.

00:19:58.068 --> 00:20:01.048
They gave him back his money,
that he had given to the

00:20:01.048 --> 00:20:02.960
church, and they kicked him out.
 

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.579
And they declared this is
heretical.

00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:06.240
The creator God really is God.
 

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.050
The Jewish scripture really is
our scripture,

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:12.118
and the God of Israel is the
God of Jesus Christ,

00:20:12.118 --> 00:20:14.420
also the father of Jesus
Christ.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:18.333
But Marcion seems to have
really put the scare of bejesus

00:20:18.333 --> 00:20:20.009
into the Roman church.
 

00:20:20.009 --> 00:20:23.549
If you didn't accept Marcion's
canon, his list,

00:20:23.549 --> 00:20:26.088
what was going to be your list?
 

00:20:26.088 --> 00:20:29.454
If you said that the other
gospels were just as important

00:20:29.454 --> 00:20:32.160
as the Gospel of Luke,
who said so and why?

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.338
And who's going to pronounce
this?

00:20:33.338 --> 00:20:36.830
Marcion, though,
seemed to have spurred other

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:41.909
Christian leaders to decide what
they thought Christian scripture

00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:43.019
should do.
 

00:20:43.019 --> 00:20:44.180
So what do you do about the
gospels?

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.715
You have four different gospels
accepted by some people,

00:20:46.715 --> 00:20:48.098
five or six by other people.
 

00:20:48.098 --> 00:20:49.970
Generally in Rome around this
time,

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:54.164
the four gospels that we have
in our bible seem to have become

00:20:54.164 --> 00:20:56.710
the most popular accepted
gospels,

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:58.390
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
 

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.740
Now, some people still try to
figure out that you've got four.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:02.720
Why do you have four?
 

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.339
So you have other people,
like Tatian.

00:21:04.339 --> 00:21:06.278
He's on your handout list, too.
 

00:21:06.278 --> 00:21:09.315
He decided to take the four
gospels and do an edition that

00:21:09.315 --> 00:21:12.616
would string all the stuff from
the different four gospels into

00:21:12.616 --> 00:21:13.308
one book.
 

00:21:13.308 --> 00:21:16.161
So he made what we call the
Diatessaron, which is a Greek

00:21:16.161 --> 00:21:17.740
word that means through four.
 

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.338
He took four books and created
one gospel out of it.

00:21:20.338 --> 00:21:25.692
You had other people who said,
well, you accept the gospel of

00:21:25.692 --> 00:21:29.619
Mark because Mark was a disciple
of Peter.

00:21:29.619 --> 00:21:31.828
This is the way Papias believed.
 

00:21:31.828 --> 00:21:36.061
Elsewhere, he said that Mark
had traveled with Peter to Rome,

00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:39.730
and Mark wrote down Peter's
version of the gospel.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:43.288
And so Papias said that's why
Mark isn't reliable.

00:21:43.288 --> 00:21:46.525
Or people would say Luke wrote
down the gospel that Paul had

00:21:46.525 --> 00:21:48.608
preached, so Luke was
authoritative.

00:21:48.608 --> 00:21:51.383
They also said,
well, Matthew was actually one

00:21:51.383 --> 00:21:53.109
of the disciples of Jesus.
 

00:21:53.109 --> 00:21:54.630
He's mentioned in the gospel.
 

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:59.190
So the Gospel of Matthew is
also by a good one.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.730
And John, also,
was believed to be that.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:05.272
Now, the problem with this is
that Papias and these other

00:22:05.272 --> 00:22:08.880
people didn't really know what
they were talking about.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.096
Papias, for example,
thought that the Gospel of

00:22:12.096 --> 00:22:15.242
Matthew had originally been
written in Hebrew,

00:22:15.242 --> 00:22:18.109
and only later translated into
Greek.

00:22:18.109 --> 00:22:19.798
This is wrong.
 

00:22:19.798 --> 00:22:23.470
Any of us who know Greek and
know Hebrew can tell that the

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.108
Gospel of Matthew was written in
Greek.

00:22:26.108 --> 00:22:28.568
It doesn't look like a
translation from Hebrew.

00:22:28.568 --> 00:22:32.670
So we tend to doubt all of
these different traditions.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.538
That Mark was the disciple of
Peter who wrote Peter's gospel.

00:22:35.538 --> 00:22:38.368
That Matthew was written by the
actual disciple Matthew.

00:22:38.368 --> 00:22:40.348
That Luke was written by the
disciple of Paul.

00:22:40.348 --> 00:22:43.058
And that John was written by
the disciple John.

00:22:43.058 --> 00:22:48.630
Basically, what modern scholars
believe is that all four of

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:52.759
these gospels were anonymously
published.

00:22:52.759 --> 00:22:55.200
They don't tell us who their
author is.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.548
Notice, they're not
pseudonymous.

00:22:58.548 --> 00:23:08.449
There's a difference between
pseudonymous writings--easy for

00:23:08.449 --> 00:23:12.980
me to say--and anonymous.
 

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:17.038
Anonymous means we don't know
who wrote it.

00:23:17.038 --> 00:23:19.348
It's published without an
author's name being listed.

00:23:19.348 --> 00:23:23.086
Pseudonymous means it's
published with a false name,

00:23:23.086 --> 00:23:25.140
a false author attributed.
 

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.987
The four gospels are not
pseudonymous because the

00:23:27.987 --> 00:23:30.420
earliest manuscripts of these
gospels,

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.130
we believe, did not contain the
titles,

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:34.900
"Gospel of Matthew,
Gospel of Mark,

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.269
Gospel of Luke,
Gospel of John."

00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:38.598
They just published the text as
it was.

00:23:38.598 --> 00:23:41.490
If it ever did have an author's
name attached to it,

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:44.608
we don't have any evidence in
the manuscript history.

00:23:44.608 --> 00:23:48.019
Nor do we have any evidence in
any other historical place.

00:23:48.019 --> 00:23:52.597
What happened was,
these names got attached to

00:23:52.597 --> 00:23:54.430
these documents.
 

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.895
And that's, eventually,
how they got included into the

00:23:57.895 --> 00:23:58.420
canon.
 

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:01.343
People thought that these
documents eventually were

00:24:01.343 --> 00:24:04.500
written by the people whose
names that they possess.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.058
And therefore,
they thought they had some kind

00:24:08.058 --> 00:24:10.588
of connection to the apostles.
 

00:24:10.588 --> 00:24:16.130
Notice what the canon list
eventually have.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.650
This is on your handout, also.
 

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:21.588
Look at the Muratorian Canon.
 

00:24:21.588 --> 00:24:24.630
Remember, the word canon just
means list.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:28.699
So this was a list of books
that some author believed were

00:24:28.699 --> 00:24:32.838
scripture and should be read by
Christians and churches.

00:24:32.838 --> 00:24:35.750
And he mentions others that he
believes they should not.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.538
Sometimes he didn't believe
they were bad books.

00:24:37.538 --> 00:24:40.384
Sometimes he believed they just
weren't supposed to be included

00:24:40.384 --> 00:24:41.990
with the highest canonical
books.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:45.599
There's a big debate about
whether this canon list was

00:24:45.599 --> 00:24:49.279
composed around the year 200 or
around the year 400.

00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:51.828
Scholars tend to line up on one
side or the other.

00:24:51.828 --> 00:24:53.986
It used to be when I was in
grad school that most people

00:24:53.986 --> 00:24:55.750
said, "Oh,
it was written around the year

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:56.298
200."
 

00:24:56.298 --> 00:24:58.351
Now, I understand that probably
the majority of scholars would

00:24:58.351 --> 00:24:58.890
say, "No.
 

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:00.028
It comes from a later
period."

00:25:00.028 --> 00:25:02.636
That's not really all that
important for us because what's

00:25:02.636 --> 00:25:04.650
important for us is to see at
this point,

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:07.778
either 200 or 400,
what was included and what was

00:25:07.778 --> 00:25:08.170
not.
 

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:13.652
This canon list includes these
books that aren't in our bible:

00:25:13.652 --> 00:25:16.885
The Wisdom of Solomon,
which is actually in the

00:25:16.885 --> 00:25:18.855
apocrypha--
and I'll talk about that--and

00:25:18.855 --> 00:25:20.130
the Apocalypse of Peter.
 

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:23.403
We do have an Apocalypse of
Peter, along with the Apocalypse

00:25:23.403 --> 00:25:23.960
of John.
 

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.328
It's just not in our bible.
 

00:25:25.328 --> 00:25:27.868
It's considered New Testament
apocryphal writings.

00:25:27.868 --> 00:25:31.674
Also, this writer excluded
these books that are in our

00:25:31.674 --> 00:25:32.250
bible.
 

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:35.160
The Letter to the Hebrews,
one letter of John,

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:39.292
he rejects the Shepherd of
Hermas, which is a book that we

00:25:39.292 --> 00:25:43.209
include in a groupings of
writing we call the Apostolic

00:25:43.209 --> 00:25:44.078
Fathers.
 

00:25:44.078 --> 00:25:46.864
It was written in the second
century sometime by a guy in

00:25:46.864 --> 00:25:49.348
Rome named Hermas,
and it's called The Shepherd.

00:25:49.348 --> 00:25:52.880
And he excludes other books he
calls gnostic books.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.036
We'll talk later in the
semester about what does gnostic

00:25:55.036 --> 00:25:55.818
mean at this time.
 

00:25:55.818 --> 00:25:59.460
So notice that this could be a
very early canon list.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.618
And it doesn't match our list.
 

00:26:01.618 --> 00:26:03.900
It does have the four gospels,
though.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:08.432
Then, the first time you get a
list by any Christian that we

00:26:08.432 --> 00:26:10.661
still possess,
that is extant,

00:26:10.661 --> 00:26:13.423
that survives,
that has the twenty-seven books

00:26:13.423 --> 00:26:16.250
of the New Testament that is in
our bible,

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:19.778
is in the year 367.
 

00:26:19.778 --> 00:26:23.635
It's the Easter letter by the
Bishop Athanasius,

00:26:23.635 --> 00:26:26.180
who was Bishop of Alexandria.
 

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.289
Bishops at this time,
especially of major cities,

00:26:28.289 --> 00:26:30.796
would sometimes send around
what we call a paschal letter,

00:26:30.796 --> 00:26:31.720
an Easter letter.
 

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.394
In which they'd give
instructions or different kinds

00:26:33.394 --> 00:26:34.380
of things to their churches.
 

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.557
And in one year when he's doing
this, he says,

00:26:36.557 --> 00:26:39.462
"These are the books that
you should read and should not

00:26:39.462 --> 00:26:40.190
read."
 

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:43.928
And this is the first time that
the precise twenty-seven books

00:26:43.928 --> 00:26:47.358
that he lists are the
twenty-seven books that we list.

00:26:47.358 --> 00:26:49.945
It's interesting,
though, he does list the

00:26:49.945 --> 00:26:52.848
letters of Paul last,
behind the other letters,

00:26:52.848 --> 00:26:56.130
rather than before them,
as we have in our list.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:59.917
And then, we don't really start
getting any kind of consistency

00:26:59.917 --> 00:27:03.584
with this until into the third
and fourth and fifth and sixth

00:27:03.584 --> 00:27:04.440
centuries.
 

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.615
So what I'm saying now is it
took a long time for this to

00:27:07.615 --> 00:27:08.240
solidify.
 

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.651
And one of the things we think
made it solidify was the

00:27:11.651 --> 00:27:13.799
development of codices,
a codex.

00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:17.759
What is a codex?
 

00:27:17.759 --> 00:27:22.220
Early books were all scrolls.
 

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:26.825
So if you had a book as long as
the Gospel of Matthew,

00:27:26.825 --> 00:27:30.038
it'd take up a pretty thick
scroll.

00:27:30.038 --> 00:27:33.583
Now, what happens if you want
to read not the whole book of

00:27:33.583 --> 00:27:36.700
Matthew, but you just want to
read Matthew 13:13?

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.258
Well, you have to unroll your
scroll, and unroll,

00:27:39.258 --> 00:27:41.069
roll, roll, roll,
roll, roll, roll,

00:27:41.069 --> 00:27:41.548
roll.
 

00:27:41.548 --> 00:27:43.578
You have to find the place,
then, roll it all back up.

00:27:43.578 --> 00:27:46.027
And what happens if you want to
move back and forth between a

00:27:46.027 --> 00:27:47.210
bunch of different letters?
 

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:48.618
Well, you have to unroll
different scrolls.

00:27:48.618 --> 00:27:52.215
Scrolls in synagogues,
they didn't have books like

00:27:52.215 --> 00:27:52.730
this.
 

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:54.980
They just had a basket or a box
or a place called a

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:55.700
geniza.
 

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.529
And they just had scrolls all
in it.

00:27:57.529 --> 00:27:59.646
So if you wanted to read
Isaiah, it actually was more

00:27:59.646 --> 00:28:00.380
than one scroll.
 

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.098
So you'd have to take that
scroll out and undo it.

00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:05.800
Now, what some scholars may
have speculated--we don't know

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:06.558
this for sure.
 

00:28:06.558 --> 00:28:08.068
Some time around this period of
time,

00:28:08.068 --> 00:28:10.430
in early Christianity,
somebody got the big idea,

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:14.450
"Hey, let's cut up the
scroll into pages,

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:16.819
and sew the pages together.
 

00:28:16.819 --> 00:28:18.410
And then, put it all in a book.
 

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:20.390
And that way you can flip
around in it a lot easier."

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:23.289
Some scholars have even
speculated that Christians may

00:28:23.289 --> 00:28:26.626
have been the first to do this,
because they were arguing with

00:28:26.626 --> 00:28:28.160
their friends,
the Jews.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.630
Or their enemies,
the Jews, in some cases.

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:34.691
And if you want to prove that
Jesus really was born of a

00:28:34.691 --> 00:28:37.566
virgin,
well, you need to go to that

00:28:37.566 --> 00:28:40.422
passage in Isaiah where,
at least the Greek

00:28:40.422 --> 00:28:42.068
version--it's not in the
Hebrew--

00:28:42.068 --> 00:28:46.076
but the Greek version of the
Jewish scripture said that this

00:28:46.076 --> 00:28:48.250
man would be born of a virgin.
 

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:51.180
That's the prophecy that we
read around Christmas time.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.798
A virgin will bear a son.
 

00:28:52.798 --> 00:28:55.422
But you might have to,
also, refer to a Psalm over

00:28:55.422 --> 00:28:57.509
here or to another passage over
here.

00:28:57.509 --> 00:28:59.386
And it's too difficult if
you're unraveling scrolls and

00:28:59.386 --> 00:28:59.838
everything.
 

00:28:59.838 --> 00:29:01.568
So some people believe that
Christians,

00:29:01.568 --> 00:29:03.828
precisely because they wanted
to proof text a lot,

00:29:03.828 --> 00:29:06.575
they wanted to run around
through a lot of different

00:29:06.575 --> 00:29:10.557
texts,
they actually invented the

00:29:10.557 --> 00:29:11.500
codex.
 

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.650
I'm not talking about tampons.
 

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:17.680
Codex, with a "d,"
okay?

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:21.338
All that means is this is a
codex.

00:29:21.338 --> 00:29:24.720
It just means pages sewn
together and placed within the

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.910
covers of a book.
 

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:28.586
So when you see the word
"book"

00:29:28.586 --> 00:29:32.269
in ancient Greek or Latin,
they didn't think of this.

00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:33.650
They thought of scrolls.
 

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:36.134
So when you see the word book,
the mechanical thing they're

00:29:36.134 --> 00:29:37.720
actually talking about is a
scroll.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.201
This was an interesting new
invention of a new piece of

00:29:42.201 --> 00:29:43.279
technology.
 

00:29:43.279 --> 00:29:48.166
Maybe not quite as
revolutionary as the computer,

00:29:48.166 --> 00:29:49.390
but close.
 

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:52.220
Because all of a sudden,
cumbersome scrolls--

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:56.368
what would be contained in the
codices we have--

00:29:56.368 --> 00:29:59.288
the plural of this is,
is either codexes sometimes,

00:29:59.288 --> 00:30:02.038
or if you want to act like you
actually know Greek--

00:30:02.038 --> 00:30:05.125
I mean, Latin,
you'd use the old Latinized

00:30:05.125 --> 00:30:06.480
plural, codices.
 

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.618
And you'll see both of those
written in different sources.

00:30:08.618 --> 00:30:15.363
A Codex of the bible would be
pretty big, maybe that thick and

00:30:15.363 --> 00:30:16.690
that wide.
 

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.626
The ones we have,
they are stored in the Vatican

00:30:19.626 --> 00:30:20.190
Museum.
 

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:22.278
We have a few of them that
survived from this period.

00:30:22.278 --> 00:30:24.680
They're pretty impressive
looking.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.884
But they would be big,
but still that would be a lot

00:30:27.884 --> 00:30:31.717
easier to transport and handle
than a whole box or closet full

00:30:31.717 --> 00:30:32.660
of scrolls.
 

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:37.588
So this was a very innovative
piece of technology.

00:30:37.588 --> 00:30:42.031
But one problem that this also
caused is if you're going to put

00:30:42.031 --> 00:30:44.655
all the books,
the documents that you think

00:30:44.655 --> 00:30:47.131
are scripture,
between two covers and not just

00:30:47.131 --> 00:30:49.990
have a bunch of scrolls lying in
a box or a closet--

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:51.557
with the scrolls,
you can take one out and put

00:30:51.557 --> 00:30:52.009
another in.
 

00:30:52.009 --> 00:30:54.261
If you decide that you think
Daniel is not scripture,

00:30:54.261 --> 00:30:56.513
or you think the Revelation of
John is not scripture,

00:30:56.513 --> 00:30:57.900
just take it out of the box.
 

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:01.038
Put it somewhere else in the
synagogue or the church.

00:31:01.038 --> 00:31:04.881
But once you start publishing
things in between covers,

00:31:04.881 --> 00:31:09.220
you actually have to decide
what goes in and what goes out.

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.746
And so around this time,
the third, fourth,

00:31:11.746 --> 00:31:14.333
and fifth century,
we get different codices,

00:31:14.333 --> 00:31:16.558
different codexes,
that is books.

00:31:16.558 --> 00:31:19.657
And we can tell,
then, what sorts of books they

00:31:19.657 --> 00:31:21.680
included in their scripture.
 

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:26.970
And notice on your handout just
some examples of this.

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:30.851
The canon of Mommson,
early fourth century canon,

00:31:30.851 --> 00:31:33.923
includes Matthew,
Mark, John, and Luke,

00:31:33.923 --> 00:31:35.380
in that order.
 

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:39.259
So it has our four and only our
four, but in a different order.

00:31:39.259 --> 00:31:42.240
It excludes the Letter to the
Hebrews, the Letter of James,

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.318
the Letter of Jude.
 

00:31:43.318 --> 00:31:45.180
And this is one of the
interesting things about it.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.281
It argues that the books must
be exactly twenty-four,

00:31:48.281 --> 00:31:51.505
because Revelation 4:10 has
twenty-four elders in God's

00:31:51.505 --> 00:31:52.460
throne room.
 

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:57.680
Convincing argument; right?
 

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.425
Codex Sinaiticus,
which is around the year 350,

00:32:01.425 --> 00:32:05.905
we think, is one of the
earliest codices of the bible we

00:32:05.905 --> 00:32:06.640
have.
 

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.315
It includes the Letter of
Barnabus, which we don't have in

00:32:09.315 --> 00:32:12.131
our bibles, but we do possess
it, and the Shepherd of Hermas,

00:32:12.131 --> 00:32:13.680
which I already talked about.
 

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.440
Which was written somewhere
around the year 100 in Rome or

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.359
right after that.
 

00:32:17.359 --> 00:32:19.509
It also excludes Jude.
 

00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:22.469
So it has two books that we
don't include and excludes one

00:32:22.469 --> 00:32:23.558
that we do include.
 

00:32:23.558 --> 00:32:26.269
Codex Claromontanus from the
sixth century,

00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:28.336
so in the 500s,
includes Matthew,

00:32:28.336 --> 00:32:29.950
John, Mark, and Luke.
 

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:31.566
Again, it has all four,
but they're in a different

00:32:31.566 --> 00:32:31.828
order.
 

00:32:31.828 --> 00:32:35.428
It has the Letter of Barnabus,
the Shepherd of Hermas,

00:32:35.428 --> 00:32:38.347
the Acts of Paul,
along with the Acts of the

00:32:38.347 --> 00:32:41.200
Apostles, and the Revelation of
Peter.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.430
So it has that Revelation of
Peter, again.

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:46.432
It excludes Paul's letter to
the Philippians,

00:32:46.432 --> 00:32:49.230
which is in our bible,
Hebrews and 1 and 2

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:50.460
Thessalonians.
 

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:53.723
Now, notice that means that
some people would say that they

00:32:53.723 --> 00:32:56.257
use that 367 date,
when Bishop Athanasius sent

00:32:56.257 --> 00:32:57.890
around his Easter letter.
 

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:00.699
And they say that's when the
Christian canon of the New

00:33:00.699 --> 00:33:01.740
Testament was set.
 

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.380
Because it's the earliest that
we have.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:04.369
But that's not really right.
 

00:33:04.369 --> 00:33:07.160
He was just bishop of one area.
 

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.864
His letter was not binding on
anybody else,

00:33:09.864 --> 00:33:13.019
except the churches in his
Alexandrian diocese.

00:33:13.019 --> 00:33:15.170
So it didn't set the canon.
 

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:18.401
367 is simply the time when we
get the earliest list that

00:33:18.401 --> 00:33:21.980
matches our list of twenty-seven
books of the New Testament.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.028
But you can see when you look
at all these different codices,

00:33:24.028 --> 00:33:27.038
different canon lists,
from a century later in the

00:33:27.038 --> 00:33:28.913
400s,
two centuries later in the

00:33:28.913 --> 00:33:31.150
500s, three centuries later in
the 600s,

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:33.420
you still get different lists.
 

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:38.916
So it took a long time for the
twenty books that we have to get

00:33:38.916 --> 00:33:40.068
settled on.
 

00:33:40.068 --> 00:33:44.013
And we'll talk about how that
actually happened,

00:33:44.013 --> 00:33:45.190
also, still.
 

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:50.650
What really happened was
consensus.

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:53.441
Different bishops in different
major cities and different

00:33:53.441 --> 00:33:56.280
councils would sometimes try to
decide, and they'd put out

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:56.880
decrees.
 

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:01.079
But they never completely
settled the question for all

00:34:01.079 --> 00:34:04.329
Christians everywhere around the
world.

00:34:04.329 --> 00:34:06.200
This is surprising.
 

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.340
But what counts as the bible is
still not agreed upon by

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:12.599
Christians around the world.
 

00:34:12.599 --> 00:34:15.612
So generally,
the canon of the New Testament,

00:34:15.612 --> 00:34:19.106
our twenty-seven books,
is accepted by all Christian

00:34:19.106 --> 00:34:20.750
churches, generally.
 

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:25.025
Except that the Revelation of
John is still not part of the

00:34:25.025 --> 00:34:28.931
lectionary or canon in some
Eastern and Middle Eastern

00:34:28.931 --> 00:34:29.889
churches.
 

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:31.842
So, for example,
if you--I can't remember which

00:34:31.842 --> 00:34:34.262
of these there are--but there
are churches all through the

00:34:34.262 --> 00:34:35.750
Middle East and the East,
also.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:39.009
And some of them don't have the
Revelation of John in their New

00:34:39.009 --> 00:34:39.639
Testament.
 

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:42.206
The canon of all the scripture
therefore has never been

00:34:42.206 --> 00:34:44.679
completely the same for all
Christians everywhere.

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:48.190
The Western Roman Catholic
canon, and the Greek Slavonic

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:50.715
bibles,
have for example,

00:34:50.715 --> 00:34:54.599
Tobit, part of the Old
Testament,

00:34:54.599 --> 00:34:58.760
Judith, the Wisdom of Solomon,
Ecclesiasticus,

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.500
Baruch, and the letter of
Jeremiah,

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.710
and 1 and 2 Maccabees.
 

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:06.726
They also have a longer version
of Daniel and a longer version

00:35:06.726 --> 00:35:07.320
of Esther.
 

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.485
So the Western Roman Catholic
canon and Greek and Slavonic

00:35:11.485 --> 00:35:14.628
bibles will include our canon
that you have,

00:35:14.628 --> 00:35:15.579
probably.
 

00:35:15.579 --> 00:35:17.572
But they'll also,
maybe, include things that if

00:35:17.572 --> 00:35:19.739
you grew up in a Protestant
church, was not in your

00:35:19.739 --> 00:35:20.650
Protestant bible.
 

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:24.750
The Greek and Slavonic bibles
also accept 1 Esdras,

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:29.704
the Prayer of Manasseh,
Psalm 151--they have another

00:35:29.704 --> 00:35:31.775
Psalm--
and 3 Maccabees,

00:35:31.775 --> 00:35:33.570
another Maccabean book.
 

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:35.530
You don't need to memorize all
this.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:38.289
I'm just trying to give you an
idea of the variety of different

00:35:38.289 --> 00:35:40.650
canons for different churches in
different regions.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:44.820
The Slavonic and Latin Vulgate
also accept Psalm 151 and 3

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:45.699
Maccabees.
 

00:35:45.699 --> 00:35:50.349
And the Greek canon also
accepts 4 Maccabees.

00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:54.280
Why is the Protestant canon
like it is?

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.159
Well, at the time of the
Reformation,

00:35:57.159 --> 00:36:00.255
Roman Catholics had not only
the 27 books of the New

00:36:00.255 --> 00:36:02.440
Testament canon that we now
have,

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.221
and they had what Protestants
came to accept as the Old

00:36:05.221 --> 00:36:05.840
Testament.
 

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.516
But they had several other
books that we now call the

00:36:09.516 --> 00:36:13.900
Apocrypha, such as Judith or
Tobit or the 1 and 2 Maccabees.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.969
When you buy your bible,
if you buy the one I ordered,

00:36:16.969 --> 00:36:19.806
it's called the New Oxford
Annotated Bible with

00:36:19.806 --> 00:36:20.849
Apocrypha.
 

00:36:20.849 --> 00:36:23.469
And they take these certain
books, and they put them in a

00:36:23.469 --> 00:36:24.920
special section of the bible.
 

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.438
To show that they're not
exactly part of the Hebrew

00:36:27.438 --> 00:36:30.260
Bible, but they're also not part
of the New Testament.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:32.719
But early Christians accepted
all these books.

00:36:32.719 --> 00:36:36.280
Early Christians didn't read
the Hebrew bible in Hebrew.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.250
They all read it in Greek.
 

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:41.007
So when they were first dealing
with Jewish scripture,

00:36:41.007 --> 00:36:43.869
they didn't read it in Hebrew,
they read it in Greek.

00:36:43.869 --> 00:36:47.777
There were several other Greek
Jewish documents that weren't

00:36:47.777 --> 00:36:50.360
part of the traditional Hebrew
bible.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.596
But they were still accepted by
a lot of Jews,

00:36:52.596 --> 00:36:55.179
and therefore by a lot of
Christians as scripture.

00:36:55.179 --> 00:36:58.097
Those books were accepted by
Catholics, by Roman Catholics

00:36:58.097 --> 00:37:00.400
and by Christians up until the
Reformation.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.639
At the Reformation,
the reformers,

00:37:02.639 --> 00:37:05.949
Martin Luther,
Calvin, Melanchthon,

00:37:05.949 --> 00:37:08.880
they decided that--this was,
remember,

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:13.322
after the Renaissance and the
beginnings of the rediscovery of

00:37:13.322 --> 00:37:17.840
the study of Greek and Latin
text in the original documents.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.599
They wanted to go back to the
Hebrew.

00:37:19.599 --> 00:37:20.860
So they learned Hebrew.
 

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.141
They started reading the Hebrew
Bible in Hebrew,

00:37:23.141 --> 00:37:24.889
not in Greek or Latin
translation.

00:37:24.889 --> 00:37:27.539
They, also, tried to come up
with the correct Greek text of

00:37:27.539 --> 00:37:29.092
the New Testament
documents,

00:37:29.092 --> 00:37:30.510
by doing textual criticism.
 

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:33.529
They were practicing what was
burgeoning scholarship of the

00:37:33.529 --> 00:37:35.554
period,
in the sixteenth century,

00:37:35.554 --> 00:37:37.659
to go back to the original
texts,

00:37:37.659 --> 00:37:39.050
as close as they could get.
 

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:41.829
What these reformers then did,
they said, "Wait a minute.

00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:46.063
Look at all these Greek Jewish
books that aren't part of the

00:37:46.063 --> 00:37:47.139
Hebrew Bible.
 

00:37:47.139 --> 00:37:48.349
They don't exist in Hebrew.
 

00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:49.610
They only exist in Greek."
 

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:51.166
So they said,
"We're not going to accept

00:37:51.166 --> 00:37:52.690
those as part of the Old
Testament."

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:56.923
They decided to go back to what
the Hebrew texts of the Old

00:37:56.923 --> 00:38:00.940
Testament, and not accept the
Greek Jewish documents.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:02.900
The Roman Catholics decided,
"No.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.869
We're going to keep these
documents, also."

00:38:04.869 --> 00:38:09.097
Which is why the Roman Catholic
Old Testament is larger than the

00:38:09.097 --> 00:38:10.909
Protestant Old Testament.
 

00:38:10.909 --> 00:38:12.994
The Roman Catholic Old
Testament has the same books

00:38:12.994 --> 00:38:14.539
that the Protestant Old
Testament has,

00:38:14.539 --> 00:38:16.750
but they kept these other Greek
Jewish documents.

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:19.505
We call those the Apocrypha,
"the hidden

00:38:19.505 --> 00:38:21.699
writings,"
is what it means.

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:21.909
Yes, sir?
 

00:38:21.909 --> 00:38:22.940
Student: 
&gt;

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.199
Prof: When and how did
Jewish scripture become settled?

00:38:24.199 --> 00:38:27.936
The Jewish bible started
developing in the Rabbinic

00:38:27.936 --> 00:38:28.610
period.
 

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:30.922
So what the rabbis--now,
this is all after Jesus and

00:38:30.922 --> 00:38:31.239
Paul.
 

00:38:31.239 --> 00:38:32.724
So we're talking about the
third, fourth and fifth,

00:38:32.724 --> 00:38:33.260
sixth centuries.
 

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:38.472
They started teaching people
that only the Hebrew scriptures

00:38:38.472 --> 00:38:40.860
in Hebrew should be used.
 

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.771
In other words,
the rabbis, eventually,

00:38:42.771 --> 00:38:44.987
started rejecting the use of
the Greek bible,

00:38:44.987 --> 00:38:45.440
also.
 

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.768
This took time, though.
 

00:38:46.768 --> 00:38:50.164
Because at the time of Paul and
Jesus, more Jews actually had

00:38:50.164 --> 00:38:53.503
Greek as their first language
than had Hebrew as their first

00:38:53.503 --> 00:38:54.239
language.
 

00:38:54.239 --> 00:38:57.393
Most Jews in the first century
would've used Greek as their

00:38:57.393 --> 00:38:59.840
first language,
not Hebrew or even Aramaic.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.989
So they read their scripture in
Greek.

00:39:01.989 --> 00:39:04.539
And some people would
believe--this is a debated

00:39:04.539 --> 00:39:06.670
question--
I would even say that one

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:10.047
reason the rabbis started using
Hebrew more and taking the

00:39:10.047 --> 00:39:13.186
Hebrew Bible is because they
were reacting against the

00:39:13.186 --> 00:39:16.780
predominance of Christianity,
as it grew more and more strong.

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:20.992
So as Rabbinic ideas and as
Rabbinic practices developed in

00:39:20.992 --> 00:39:23.936
late antiquity,
they taught that they should

00:39:23.936 --> 00:39:26.599
reject the Greek bible,
not use the Greek bible.

00:39:26.599 --> 00:39:27.655
Except, I mean,
you could use it,

00:39:27.655 --> 00:39:28.780
but not use it as
authoritative.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:31.322
And they started teaching that
the Hebrew Bible should be the

00:39:31.322 --> 00:39:32.170
one that Jews use.
 

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:34.925
So the Jews today,
what they call it is Tanakh,

00:39:34.925 --> 00:39:38.461
which is an acronym from Torah
and then, prophet--the Torah,

00:39:38.461 --> 00:39:41.099
the Law, the Prophets,
and the Writings.

00:39:41.099 --> 00:39:43.530
So they will call their bible
Tanakh often,

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:44.690
or just the bible.
 

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:48.431
And it includes only those
Hebrew documents that the rabbis

00:39:48.431 --> 00:39:51.530
eventually said were part of the
Hebrew Bible.

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:52.989
Good question.
 

00:39:52.989 --> 00:39:57.063
So notice how Jews have one
bible that's basically centered

00:39:57.063 --> 00:39:58.750
on the ancient Hebrew.
 

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:01.400
Protestants have followed the
rabbis, in a sense,

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.659
and accepted the Hebrew Bible
as being the Old Testament.

00:40:04.659 --> 00:40:07.577
Roman Catholics actually
followed more what was ancient

00:40:07.577 --> 00:40:10.929
Christian tradition of accepting
not only the Hebrew Bible,

00:40:10.929 --> 00:40:13.793
although it was translated into
Latin and Greek most of the

00:40:13.793 --> 00:40:16.016
time,
But also Jewish documents that

00:40:16.016 --> 00:40:19.001
came from that period and were
surviving in Greek,

00:40:19.001 --> 00:40:19.610
itself.
 

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:22.802
So that's why Christian,
Protestants have one set of

00:40:22.802 --> 00:40:26.619
texts, Roman Catholics have
another, and Jews have another.

00:40:26.619 --> 00:40:30.090
Now, what about those
Episcopalians?

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:31.800
As one of my friends says,
"Those

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.909
whiskey-palians."
 

00:40:32.909 --> 00:40:35.800
They decided to be in the
middle.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:39.126
So they wanted to be somewhat
Protestant and somewhat

00:40:39.126 --> 00:40:39.829
Catholic.
 

00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:43.302
So if you go to an Anglican
church, they will also,

00:40:43.302 --> 00:40:46.219
most of the time,
accept the Roman Catholic

00:40:46.219 --> 00:40:48.860
canon, along with Roman
Catholics.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.143
Even though a lot of
Episcopalians and Anglicans--a

00:40:51.143 --> 00:40:53.563
lot of them, not all of
them--will consider themselves

00:40:53.563 --> 00:40:54.250
Protestant.
 

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:58.018
So Anglicans follow the Roman
Catholic canon a bit more.

00:40:58.018 --> 00:40:59.909
Protestants and Jews have
different ones.

00:40:59.909 --> 00:41:02.159
That's kind of where we are
right now.

00:41:02.159 --> 00:41:04.900
But notice how long it took us
to get there,

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.750
how many centuries it took.
 

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:11.789
Now, the big question is who
did it and why did they do it?

00:41:11.789 --> 00:41:14.751
Basically, some councils in the
early church,

00:41:14.751 --> 00:41:17.713
councils that would be called
by the Emperor,

00:41:17.713 --> 00:41:19.934
for example,
by Constantine or his

00:41:19.934 --> 00:41:21.079
successors.
 

00:41:21.079 --> 00:41:24.304
Sometimes they would get so
tired of churches--you know how

00:41:24.304 --> 00:41:26.250
Christians squabble all the
time.

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:28.777
You know, when I was a kid
growing up in Texas,

00:41:28.777 --> 00:41:31.746
one of our sayings was,
"Let's make like a Baptist

00:41:31.746 --> 00:41:33.230
church and split."
 

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:37.056
So, you know,
Christians are always

00:41:37.056 --> 00:41:38.518
squabbling.
 

00:41:38.518 --> 00:41:41.452
So the emperors would try to
call together councils to get

00:41:41.452 --> 00:41:42.789
them to agree on things.
 

00:41:42.789 --> 00:41:45.088
To get them to agree on
doctrine, to get them to agree

00:41:45.088 --> 00:41:45.739
on the canon.
 

00:41:45.739 --> 00:41:48.260
So some councils did try to set
the canon.

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.070
And so you had some councils
doing this.

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:53.300
But generally,
the canon developed over time

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.380
through a process of general
consensus.

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:58.434
And then, as I said,
through these different

00:41:58.434 --> 00:42:01.112
institutions of Christianity
ending up coming to somewhat

00:42:01.112 --> 00:42:02.260
different decisions.
 

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:04.010
But why do they include things?
 

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:06.802
Why were some texts included in
the New Testament and other text

00:42:06.802 --> 00:42:08.400
not included in the New
Testament?

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:12.443
The reason is not the one that
most modern people think is the

00:42:12.443 --> 00:42:13.039
reason.
 

00:42:13.039 --> 00:42:15.936
Most modern people say,
"Why is this text

00:42:15.936 --> 00:42:16.710
scripture?
 

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:17.849
Why is it canon?"
 

00:42:17.849 --> 00:42:19.733
And most Christians will say,
"Because it is

00:42:19.733 --> 00:42:20.400
inspired."
 

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.090
That's not what the ancients
believed.

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:24.864
They believed that
inspiration--there were lots of

00:42:24.864 --> 00:42:26.891
texts that were inspired,
and there were different levels

00:42:26.891 --> 00:42:27.579
of inspiration.
 

00:42:27.579 --> 00:42:29.780
So just because a text is
inspired,

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:33.505
or even if you believe it's
inspired by God and that God

00:42:33.505 --> 00:42:37.362
told somebody to write it,
that wasn't enough for ancient

00:42:37.362 --> 00:42:40.960
Christians to include it in
their bible, in their canon.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.728
So inspiration,
contrary to modern assumptions

00:42:43.728 --> 00:42:47.300
was not the criteria you hear
ancient people talk about.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:50.829
Apostolic authorship was one
thing they talk about.

00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:53.762
So for example,
Papias and other ancient

00:42:53.762 --> 00:42:55.440
writers,
they said, "Well,

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:56.949
we accept the Gospel of Mark
because,

00:42:56.949 --> 00:42:58.500
well, if it wasn't written by
an apostle,

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.110
it was written by someone very
close to an apostle.

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:03.150
And it was Peter's gospel that
Mark just published.

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:06.349
Or Luke published Paul's
gospel."

00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:09.949
So, often, some people in the
ancient world,

00:43:09.949 --> 00:43:12.030
if there was a gospel they
didn't like,

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:13.320
they didn't want it to be
included,

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:17.059
they would argue against it
being authored by an apostle.

00:43:17.059 --> 00:43:19.592
So that at least,
they claimed for some that

00:43:19.592 --> 00:43:23.067
through these texts that they
wanted apostolic authorship or

00:43:23.067 --> 00:43:25.070
close to apostolic authorship.
 

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:29.067
The problem was we can tell
historically that these texts

00:43:29.067 --> 00:43:31.280
were not written by apostles.
 

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.961
Nor do we believe they were
written even by the close

00:43:33.961 --> 00:43:35.199
disciples of apostles.
 

00:43:35.199 --> 00:43:37.300
They're anonymous texts.
 

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:40.148
So if that was the reason they
were included in the ancient

00:43:40.148 --> 00:43:42.266
world,
it's not the reason they're

00:43:42.266 --> 00:43:44.483
still in now,
because modern scholars don't

00:43:44.483 --> 00:43:47.137
believe the apostles actually
wrote all of these texts in the

00:43:47.137 --> 00:43:47.889
New Testament.
 

00:43:47.889 --> 00:43:51.420
Flexibly, here are the criteria.
 

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.628
If it's not necessarily
apostleship, and it's not

00:43:54.628 --> 00:43:57.369
inspiration, what are the real
reasons?

00:43:57.369 --> 00:44:00.764
First, it seems that the text
that at least these people

00:44:00.764 --> 00:44:04.592
believed were the most ancient
and had the closest proximity to

00:44:04.592 --> 00:44:05.210
Jesus.
 

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:07.445
Like I said,
they wanted them to be traced

00:44:07.445 --> 00:44:08.699
back to the apostles.
 

00:44:08.699 --> 00:44:11.384
So even if they weren't,
it's because that's what people

00:44:11.384 --> 00:44:12.800
believed about these texts.
 

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:16.670
A second big reason was simply
general acceptance.

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:20.940
Apparently, the texts that were
the most popular over a bigger

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:24.789
geographical space tended to be
the ones that got in.

00:44:24.789 --> 00:44:26.842
Now, it's true,
there were different gospels

00:44:26.842 --> 00:44:29.710
that were popular in different
parts of the Mediterranean.

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:31.782
So for example,
the Gospel of Thomas seems to

00:44:31.782 --> 00:44:34.610
have been especially popular in
certain parts of the East.

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:37.652
And in Rome there would be
other document--or different

00:44:37.652 --> 00:44:39.230
parts of the Roman Empire.
 

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:41.173
But, generally,
as time went on,

00:44:41.173 --> 00:44:45.063
it seems like Christian leaders
tried to include those gospels,

00:44:45.063 --> 00:44:48.449
those documents that were more
generally accepted.

00:44:48.449 --> 00:44:49.980
In fact, if you wanted to argue
against,

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.489
say, the Letter of Hebrews
being included,

00:44:51.489 --> 00:44:53.577
you could say,
"But all the people in the

00:44:53.577 --> 00:44:56.639
East don't accept the Letter of
Hebrews as part of their canon,

00:44:56.639 --> 00:44:58.000
so we shouldn't, either."
 

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.760
So general acceptance was big.
 

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:03.706
But the most important
criterion--this probably won't

00:45:03.706 --> 00:45:08.413
shock you, especially if you're
as cynical as I am--theological

00:45:08.413 --> 00:45:09.780
acceptability.
 

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:13.425
People tended to want to
include the documents that

00:45:13.425 --> 00:45:15.539
matched their own theology.
 

00:45:15.539 --> 00:45:18.733
In other words,
you believed something was

00:45:18.733 --> 00:45:22.159
apostolic if it taught stuff you
believed.

00:45:22.159 --> 00:45:24.686
So, of course,
documents that did teach that

00:45:24.686 --> 00:45:28.036
the creator God was an evil
demonic god and not the father

00:45:28.036 --> 00:45:30.418
of Jesus Christ--
and there are early Christian

00:45:30.418 --> 00:45:33.260
documents that teach this--
they were excluded.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:34.440
Why were they excluded?
 

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.590
Well, some of them claimed to
be by apostles.

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:39.590
Nobody exactly knew how old
they were.

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:43.177
They were excluded because they
taught a doctrine that other

00:45:43.177 --> 00:45:46.340
Christians thought was heretical
and not accurate.

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:48.577
So when you say,
though, theological

00:45:48.577 --> 00:45:52.159
appropriateness is what ended up
being the most important

00:45:52.159 --> 00:45:55.230
criterion for including stuff in
the canon,

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:57.896
you actually have to say then,
"Appropriate to

00:45:57.896 --> 00:45:58.590
whom?"
 

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:00.518
And of course that means you
have a judgment call.

00:46:00.518 --> 00:46:02.594
But generally,
the documents that came to be

00:46:02.594 --> 00:46:04.764
accepted were the ones that
people we call the

00:46:04.764 --> 00:46:06.260
"proto-orthodox."
 

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.271
This is a term that Bart Ehrman
uses in his textbook.

00:46:08.271 --> 00:46:08.889
You'll see it.
 

00:46:08.889 --> 00:46:10.420
And he explains what he means
by this.

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:12.088
In the second century you can't
really use the term

00:46:12.088 --> 00:46:13.155
"orthodox
Christianity"

00:46:13.155 --> 00:46:14.525
versus "heretical
Christianity,"

00:46:14.525 --> 00:46:16.525
because there wasn't--
orthodoxy hadn't been

00:46:16.525 --> 00:46:17.440
established, yet.
 

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.679
It was all in a state of flux.
 

00:46:19.679 --> 00:46:21.380
People believed all kinds of
different things.

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:24.380
And what this class will do is
talk about how did orthodox--

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:26.480
what became orthodox
Christianity--how did it become

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.476
orthodox Christianity,
rather than one of the other

00:46:28.476 --> 00:46:29.268
kinds of Christianity?
 

00:46:29.268 --> 00:46:30.929
And we'll talk about that
repeatedly.

00:46:30.929 --> 00:46:33.536
In the second century,
though, it's anachronistic to

00:46:33.536 --> 00:46:36.860
talk about orthodox Christianity
versus heretical Christianity.

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:39.074
So what some scholars have done
is create this word

00:46:39.074 --> 00:46:40.360
"proto-orthodox."
 

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:44.230
And all they mean is those
Christians who believe the kinds

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:48.235
of stuff that would later be
proclaimed as orthodox in creeds

00:46:48.235 --> 00:46:49.369
and councils.
 

00:46:49.369 --> 00:46:53.284
So what happened was the people
who were the Christians in the

00:46:53.284 --> 00:46:55.989
second century,
and the third century,

00:46:55.989 --> 00:46:58.880
who resembled what later became
Nicean,

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.478
Orthodox Christianity,
they were the ones who had the

00:47:02.478 --> 00:47:05.561
most say,
eventually, in what became part

00:47:05.561 --> 00:47:06.579
of the bible.
 

00:47:06.579 --> 00:47:09.764
So in the end,
the canon is a list of the

00:47:09.764 --> 00:47:15.099
winners in the historical debate
to define orthodox Christianity.

00:47:15.099 --> 00:47:17.500
Questions?
 

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:18.750
Comments?
 

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:20.119
Outbursts?
 

00:47:20.119 --> 00:47:23.010
Rantings and ravings?
 

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:24.409
No?
 

00:47:24.409 --> 00:47:26.050
Yes, sir?
 

00:47:26.050 --> 00:47:34.780
Student: 
&gt;

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:35.460
Prof: Okay.
 

00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:37.297
If the books were written
anonymously how did the names

00:47:37.297 --> 00:47:38.659
that are associated with
them…

00:47:38.659 --> 00:47:46.030
Student: 
&gt;

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:51.338
Prof: Yeah,
most of the stuff that we'll

00:47:51.338 --> 00:47:55.039
say has a wrong name attached in
the New Testament is not

00:47:55.039 --> 00:47:57.550
anonymous, although there are
some.

00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:58.639
It's pseudonymous.
 

00:47:58.639 --> 00:48:00.268
But there are some that are
anonymous, too.

00:48:00.268 --> 00:48:02.780
The gospels we say are
anonymous, because they didn't

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:05.050
come attached with a name,
as far as we know.

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:07.360
How did those names get
attached?

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.206
By different people--partly it
was because they wanted this

00:48:10.206 --> 00:48:12.170
text to be authoritative in some
way,

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:15.585
and so they tended to attach
the name of a particular apostle

00:48:15.585 --> 00:48:17.579
to them or a particular
disciple.

00:48:17.579 --> 00:48:18.902
Or in some ways,
for example,

00:48:18.902 --> 00:48:21.360
the Gospel of Luke may have
gotten its name Luke,

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.989
because in the Acts of the
Apostles,

00:48:22.989 --> 00:48:24.909
which is also written by the
same author,

00:48:24.909 --> 00:48:28.219
Luke is an actual character who
follows Paul around.

00:48:28.219 --> 00:48:31.034
So it may have been that the
name Luke and the Acts of the

00:48:31.034 --> 00:48:33.800
Apostles got connected with the
acts of the apostles,

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.949
and the Gospel of Luke as its
author.

00:48:35.949 --> 00:48:37.672
So sometimes,
it's something in the text

00:48:37.672 --> 00:48:40.059
itself that may have prompted
someone to think that.

00:48:40.059 --> 00:48:42.105
Often, we just don't know how
it got it, and it just happened

00:48:42.105 --> 00:48:43.980
because somebody just said,
"It's authoritative.

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:45.230
It must've been written by an
apostle."

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:46.510
We have time for one more
question.

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:47.190
I think I saw a hand up.
 

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:48.860
Then, we need to dismiss.
 

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.269
No more questions?
 

00:48:50.269 --> 00:48:50.659
Okay.
 

00:48:50.659 --> 00:48:51.159
See you next time.
 

00:48:51.159 --> 00:48:53.559
Remember, we are meeting on
Friday.

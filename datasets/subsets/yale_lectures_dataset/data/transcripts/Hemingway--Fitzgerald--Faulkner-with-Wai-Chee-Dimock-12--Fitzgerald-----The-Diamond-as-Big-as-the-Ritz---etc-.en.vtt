WAI CHEE DIMOCK: We're moving
on to the

00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:07.033
Fitzgerald stories, and I just
wanted to make an announcement

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:10.733
about a possible field trip
to New York City.

00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:15.400
Merve Emre, one of the
teaching fellows, is

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.233
organizing a trip to see the
production of The Sun Also

00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:26.300
Rises, which is another
novel by Hemingway.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.233
It's by the Elevated--

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:32.400
what is the group called?

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.333
Elevator Repair Service.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.733
So it's very interesting.

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:39.367
Last year, they did
The Great Gatsby.

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:43.067
It was right here
at the Yale Rep.

00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:45.433
So it's a very interesting
group, and it looks like

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:48.900
they're going to keep on doing
these extended readings but

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.600
also dramatic readings
of the novel.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.233
So if you guys would like to go
to see The Sun Also Rises,

00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:58.267
just email Merve.

00:00:58.267 --> 00:01:02.100
And I'm just going
to get started on

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.867
the Fitzgerald stories.

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:08.533
And we might be under the
mis-impression from reading

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:12.933
the short stories that maybe
Fitzgerald went to Yale.

00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.933
He didn't.

00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:19.533
He was Princeton,
Class of 1917.

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:22.167
And this is actually a very
interesting that I found from

00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:23.633
the Princeton library.

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:28.367
That's a receipt that he had
at the Triangle Club.

00:01:28.367 --> 00:01:31.433
And because so many of the short
stories have to do with

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:34.633
clubs, the Yale club, and so on,
it's interesting just to

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:37.600
have this document showing that
he was a member of the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.300
Triangle Club.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.367
And this is a letter that he
wrote to his classmate, also

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:50.833
Princeton 1917, Ludlow Fowler,
who would go on to become a

00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:55.800
very prominent New York lawyer,
the founder of a very

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.267
prominent law firm.

00:01:57.267 --> 00:02:00.667
This is what he wrote
to Ludlow Fowler.

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:07.067
"I have written a 15,000-word
story about you called 'The

00:02:07.067 --> 00:02:11.800
Rich Boy.' It is in a large
measure the story of your

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.433
life, toned down here and
there and simplified.

00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:20.567
Also, many gaps had to come
out of my imagination.

00:02:20.567 --> 00:02:25.867
It is frank, unsparing, but
sympathetic, and I think you

00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:26.733
would like it."

00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:29.867
It's astonishing that he should
think so, that anyone

00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:32.967
would actually like this story
if it's supposedly based on

00:02:32.967 --> 00:02:34.333
their lives.

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:38.767
But in any case, this is what
authors sometimes think about

00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:40.167
their own work.

00:02:40.167 --> 00:02:44.467
So I think we know just from
our edition in the short

00:02:44.467 --> 00:02:49.033
stories that there were a couple
of episodes that Ludlow

00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:52.867
Fowler made Fitzgerald
take out.

00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:56.467
They are reinserted now in
brackets, but obviously there

00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:59.933
was historical proof that Ludlow
Fowler was pretty upset

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:01.933
by the story.

00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:05.467
But in any case, Fitzgerald
really thought that this was a

00:03:05.467 --> 00:03:09.533
story about a friend of his and
that the friendship was

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:12.800
what propelled him into
writing this story.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.867
So it's also in that story that
he lays out his theory

00:03:17.867 --> 00:03:23.100
about fiction and especially the
way that characters are to

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.367
be described in fiction.

00:03:25.367 --> 00:03:27.533
So here's Fitzgerald.

00:03:27.533 --> 00:03:32.300
"Begin with an individual, and
before you know it, you find

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.033
that you have created a type.

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:38.200
Begin with a type, and
you find that you

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.700
have created nothing.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.733
There are no types,
no plurals.

00:03:43.733 --> 00:03:47.467
There is a rich boy, and
this is his, and not

00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:49.600
his brother's, story.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.633
All my life, I have lived among
his brothers, but this

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:56.467
one has been my friend."

00:03:56.467 --> 00:04:01.500
So still saying within the
story itself that this is

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.067
about someone who he still
calls his friend.

00:04:07.067 --> 00:04:09.567
This is his theory.

00:04:09.567 --> 00:04:13.333
Let's see what Fitzgerald does
in practice, because we know

00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:16.767
that quite often there's a
distance between what authors

00:04:16.767 --> 00:04:21.400
profess they're doing and what
they actually end up doing.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.700
So this is his practice right
on the next page.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.667
"Let me tell you about
the very rich.

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:30.000
They are different
from you and me.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.633
They possess and enjoy early,
and it does something to them,

00:04:34.633 --> 00:04:39.733
makes them soft where we are
hard and cynical where we are

00:04:39.733 --> 00:04:43.867
trustful, in a way that, unless
you were born rich, it

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:46.800
is very difficult
to understand.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.400
They think deep in their hearts
that they are better

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.600
than we are, because we have to
discover the compensations

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.967
and refuges of life
for ourselves.

00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:05.333
Even when they enter deep into
our world or sink below us,

00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:09.000
they still think that we are
better than we are."

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.067
So let's say a couple
of things here.

00:05:12.067 --> 00:05:16.467
First, obviously, is that
Fitzgerald is using a type, a

00:05:16.467 --> 00:05:18.233
social label.

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:22.800
He's turning a rich boy into a
social type and generalizing

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.167
about this entire social type.

00:05:26.167 --> 00:05:31.833
So in many ways, he is doing
exactly what he says writers

00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:35.800
should never do, proceeding
with a type.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.233
But I think that we should also
say that given the fact

00:05:38.233 --> 00:05:42.533
that he is using a type, that
the rich boy is a generic

00:05:42.533 --> 00:05:48.100
identity that he honors, that
he recognizes as a reality,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.533
that even though he is doing
that, the contents that he

00:05:53.533 --> 00:05:55.967
attributes to that type
actually are pretty

00:05:55.967 --> 00:05:57.300
interesting.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:03.200
According to him, a rich boy,
or the rich, are people who

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.100
are different from people who
are not rich because of two

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.300
things, that they are soft where
we are hard and that

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.300
they are cynical where
we are trustful.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.933
Those two actually pull in
two different directions.

00:06:19.933 --> 00:06:24.600
If we were just to take the
first one, that they are soft

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.433
where we are hard, that's very,
very understandable,

00:06:28.433 --> 00:06:31.233
that because they didn't have
to struggle all that much,

00:06:31.233 --> 00:06:34.433
they don't have the kind of
hardihood that comes to people

00:06:34.433 --> 00:06:37.233
when they have to struggle a
lot just to get the bare

00:06:37.233 --> 00:06:39.167
essentials from life.

00:06:39.167 --> 00:06:42.867
So that would be completely
understandable.

00:06:42.867 --> 00:06:47.133
But what is interesting is that
right after that comes a

00:06:47.133 --> 00:06:50.800
statement that completely is
on the other side of the

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.900
spectrum, that whereas the rest
of us are trustful, the

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.333
rich actually are cynical.

00:07:00.333 --> 00:07:02.200
So how could this be?

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.267
Under what circumstances would
the rest of us be trustful,

00:07:06.267 --> 00:07:08.333
whereas the rich would
be cynical?

00:07:08.333 --> 00:07:10.567
This is not so self-evident.

00:07:10.567 --> 00:07:12.967
It is something that Fitzgerald
would just throw

00:07:12.967 --> 00:07:17.033
out as a generalization,
seemingly just something that

00:07:17.033 --> 00:07:20.167
he would make-- a casual point
that he would make.

00:07:20.167 --> 00:07:22.233
But actually it's
quite puzzling.

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:25.133
So we have to figure out in the
course of the story, "The

00:07:25.133 --> 00:07:29.267
Rich Boy," why it is that even
though they're soft most of

00:07:29.267 --> 00:07:33.800
the time, there are also moments
when they are actually

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.733
harder than we are, they
are more cynical

00:07:36.733 --> 00:07:38.733
than the rest of us.

00:07:38.733 --> 00:07:42.400
So in any case, all we can say
at this point is that even

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.867
though, yes, Fitzgerald uses
social types in his stories,

00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:51.033
that he has a very interesting
understanding of

00:07:51.033 --> 00:07:52.200
those social types.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.833
So we can say that he's really
not so much subscribing to the

00:07:56.833 --> 00:08:01.133
notion of social types as
playing with them, putting

00:08:01.133 --> 00:08:06.300
pressure on them, looking at all
the possible permutations

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.933
of social types.

00:08:07.933 --> 00:08:11.133
So this is something that we've
already talked about a

00:08:11.133 --> 00:08:13.700
little bit last week when we
talked about To Have and Have

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.667
Not and Hemingway's use of those
two types, "have" and

00:08:17.667 --> 00:08:18.533
"have not".

00:08:18.533 --> 00:08:21.200
So today I want to go back a
little bit and give you in

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.400
many ways the genealogy to
that kind of thinking,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.100
thinking in terms
of social types.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.967
And it actually goes back to
the mid-nineteenth century.

00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:36.100
This is a very famous text,
scientific text-- what aspires

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.867
to be a scientific text--

00:08:37.867 --> 00:08:40.067
by Josiah Nott and
George Gliddon

00:08:40.067 --> 00:08:41.967
called Types of Mankind.

00:08:41.967 --> 00:08:45.133
And if you guys are fans of
Stephen Jay Gould, you'll see

00:08:45.133 --> 00:08:49.033
that this text is actually
mentioned by Stephen Jay Gould

00:08:49.033 --> 00:08:50.567
in his book Mismeasure of Man.

00:08:50.567 --> 00:08:52.467
That's where I got my
information from.

00:08:52.467 --> 00:08:58.133
So in 1854, the understanding--

00:08:58.133 --> 00:09:03.433
there's a clear correlation,
obviously, between the facial

00:09:03.433 --> 00:09:06.633
features of a Caucasian person,
a very Greek-looking

00:09:06.633 --> 00:09:13.833
person, classical profile,
and this very flat facial

00:09:13.833 --> 00:09:17.300
structure, bone structure
of the face.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.133
The skull corresponds to
the facial features.

00:09:20.133 --> 00:09:25.667
And then obviously the
implication is that blacks and

00:09:25.667 --> 00:09:28.867
gorillas actually have the
same skull formation.

00:09:28.867 --> 00:09:31.133
So we can see where
this is heading.

00:09:31.133 --> 00:09:35.533
This is the sort of science that
is quite common in the

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:40.067
mid-nineteenth century, talking
about social types in

00:09:40.067 --> 00:09:44.100
order to suggest a very close
kinship between certain types

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.533
of humans and certain
types of animals.

00:09:46.533 --> 00:09:52.667
That's the impetus behind that
kind of taxonomic thinking.

00:09:52.667 --> 00:09:57.333
So this was in the
mid-nineteenth century, and by

00:09:57.333 --> 00:10:00.833
the twentieth century, that
pretty much has receded into

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:01.967
the background.

00:10:01.967 --> 00:10:07.033
So let's look at another kind
of thinking about types.

00:10:07.033 --> 00:10:10.767
And as we can see from this
very sober-looking,

00:10:10.767 --> 00:10:15.333
no-thrills, no-nonsense look
of the treatise, this is a

00:10:15.333 --> 00:10:19.233
very highly respected
sociological treatise by

00:10:19.233 --> 00:10:24.233
Burgess, E. W. Burgess, and
Robert Ezra Park called

00:10:24.233 --> 00:10:25.500
Introduction to the Science
of Sociology.

00:10:27.433 --> 00:10:31.133
And it turns out that social
types, the notion of social

00:10:31.133 --> 00:10:35.200
types, is crucial to the
birth of sociology.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.067
So this is what Robert
E. Park says.

00:10:39.067 --> 00:10:44.300
"I did not see how we could have
anything like scientific

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:49.800
research unless we had a system
of classification and a

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.967
frame of reference into which we
could sort out and describe

00:10:54.967 --> 00:10:58.967
in general terms the things
we were attempting to

00:10:58.967 --> 00:10:59.767
investigate."

00:10:59.767 --> 00:11:05.733
So a system of classification
and a frame of reference into

00:11:05.733 --> 00:11:09.233
which we should sort out and
describe in general terms.

00:11:09.233 --> 00:11:12.500
Obviously, there's a degree of
extraction going on, a degree

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.500
of generalization going on.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.300
We need to be able to generalize
from individual

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:21.033
cases in order to create a
system of classification.

00:11:21.033 --> 00:11:25.133
So in many ways, that's the very
foundation of the science

00:11:25.133 --> 00:11:27.700
called sociology.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:32.933
And Fitzgerald, and Hemingway
as well, they were both very

00:11:32.933 --> 00:11:39.033
much moving in that very
pervasive, very common

00:11:39.033 --> 00:11:40.400
intellectual climate.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.433
So I want to stop here for a
brief moment and talk a little

00:11:44.433 --> 00:11:47.967
bit about the interconnections
among the texts that we've

00:11:47.967 --> 00:11:49.733
read so far.

00:11:49.733 --> 00:11:54.333
As you guys recognized last
week when we were talking

00:11:54.333 --> 00:11:56.667
about To Have and Have Not, we
were talking about Harry

00:11:56.667 --> 00:12:00.267
Morgan as a kind of tension--
the character is a tension

00:12:00.267 --> 00:12:05.433
between a type, between label
of generic type and a

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:07.233
deviation from type.

00:12:07.233 --> 00:12:12.567
And we mentioned that in fact,
it's only when he is mediated

00:12:12.567 --> 00:12:14.433
through the presence of other
people, when he's channeled

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:18.233
through Marie or when he's
contrasted with Robert Gordon,

00:12:18.233 --> 00:12:20.600
that he actually becomes
somebody who's

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.600
not a social type.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.867
So that's Hemingway thinking
about type.

00:12:25.867 --> 00:12:29.233
I also want to go back a little
bit further and refresh

00:12:29.233 --> 00:12:32.533
your memory about The
Sound and the Fury.

00:12:32.533 --> 00:12:34.700
In The Sound and the Fury,
we talked a lot about the

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.867
relation between today
and tomorrow.

00:12:37.867 --> 00:12:41.933
Obviously, time is central to
The Sound and the Fury.

00:12:41.933 --> 00:12:45.200
And we were talking about
Benjy's, Quentin's, and

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.000
Jason's tomorrow as one of the
most important things linking

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.600
the three brothers.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.800
So today, what I would like to
do is to combine those two

00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:00.200
analytic structures to create a
new structure to talk about

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.400
Fitzgerald's short stories.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:07.967
We'll be talking about type and
variation, but mapped onto

00:13:07.967 --> 00:13:12.133
the concept of the relation
between today and tomorrow.

00:13:12.133 --> 00:13:17.567
So if you belong to a certain
type, if you can be labeled by

00:13:17.567 --> 00:13:21.800
a generic identity, what is the
possible future for you?

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.900
What is the possible
tomorrow for you?

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.700
So basically a combination of
Hemingway and Faulkner.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:32.633
But I also want to introduce
a new layer, a new analytic

00:13:32.633 --> 00:13:35.833
layer into our discussion,
which is the difference

00:13:35.833 --> 00:13:39.333
between a story that is dramatic
and a story that is

00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:40.100
not dramatic.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.767
And the four stories that we're
reading today represent

00:13:43.767 --> 00:13:47.933
very interesting permutations
on that platform.

00:13:47.933 --> 00:13:49.667
So we'll be talking
about that too.

00:13:49.667 --> 00:13:53.767
And this is just a very quick
run through of the argument

00:13:53.767 --> 00:13:55.400
that I'll try to make today.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.233
"The Rich Boy" is about
excessive conformity to type.

00:13:59.233 --> 00:14:01.633
Tomorrow is going to be exactly
like today, and so it

00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:02.833
is not dramatic.

00:14:02.833 --> 00:14:07.433
"Babylon Revisited" is in many
ways a kind of rewriting of

00:14:07.433 --> 00:14:12.333
"The Rich Boy." It's about
someone who conforms to type

00:14:12.333 --> 00:14:16.667
to a large extent, but not
entirely, and what happens

00:14:16.667 --> 00:14:17.633
when that's the case.

00:14:17.633 --> 00:14:21.500
And so tomorrow is not quite
like today, but still it's not

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.300
a dramatic story.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.600
And then we move on two stories

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.233
that are very dramatic.

00:14:26.233 --> 00:14:28.967
"The Diamond as Big as the
Ritz," as we know from the

00:14:28.967 --> 00:14:31.033
title, it's large-scale drama.

00:14:31.033 --> 00:14:32.933
It's very, very dramatic.

00:14:32.933 --> 00:14:36.567
And then "Bernice Bobs Her
Hair," small-scale drama, but

00:14:36.567 --> 00:14:38.600
also dramatic.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:47.300
But let's take a closer look at
"Rich Boy." And even though

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.467
Fitzgerald went into Princeton,
for some reason

00:14:49.467 --> 00:14:52.333
Yale is the reference
point for him.

00:14:52.333 --> 00:14:55.767
So the Yale Club is
a social marker.

00:14:55.767 --> 00:14:59.167
And it's very interesting that
actually Fitzgerald makes the

00:14:59.167 --> 00:15:04.133
point that Anson Hunter actually
was not popular when

00:15:04.133 --> 00:15:05.867
he was at Yale.

00:15:05.867 --> 00:15:09.033
So Fitzgerald is making a
distinction between Yale

00:15:09.033 --> 00:15:12.833
College in New Haven and the
Yale Club in New York City.

00:15:12.833 --> 00:15:15.733
And he's really talking about
the Yale Club in New York City

00:15:15.733 --> 00:15:18.433
and not so much Yale College.

00:15:18.433 --> 00:15:22.300
So Anson is devoted
to the Yale Club.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.367
He's always there.

00:15:23.367 --> 00:15:25.733
But there's also the sense that
maybe it's too much of a

00:15:25.733 --> 00:15:26.433
good thing.

00:15:26.433 --> 00:15:30.933
And so there's the possibility
that excessive conformity to

00:15:30.933 --> 00:15:33.667
type--he's the Yale
Club type--

00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:36.733
that being too much of that
would actually lead to some

00:15:36.733 --> 00:15:38.433
kind of deviation.

00:15:38.433 --> 00:15:42.800
But first of all, this is the
devotion to the Yale Club.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.200
"But he never abandoned
the Yale Club.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.233
He was a figure there, a
personality, and a tendency of

00:15:50.233 --> 00:15:54.433
his class, who were now seven
years of college, to drift

00:15:54.433 --> 00:15:59.000
away to more sober haunts was
checked by his presence."

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.333
So this is a very unremarkable
sentence in many ways.

00:16:02.333 --> 00:16:03.900
It's not something that
we would know.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.033
It's very matter-of-fact.

00:16:05.033 --> 00:16:07.367
It's very neutrally
descriptive.

00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:14.467
He's a pillar of the Yale Club,
and his presence there

00:16:14.467 --> 00:16:16.567
is an anchor for other
people, so they stick

00:16:16.567 --> 00:16:17.500
around because of him.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.267
So there's really nothing to
say one way or another,

00:16:21.267 --> 00:16:25.733
really, about this description
of Anson Hunter, other than

00:16:25.733 --> 00:16:28.433
the fact that it's a little odd
that seven years out of

00:16:28.433 --> 00:16:31.067
college that the Yale Club
is still the very

00:16:31.067 --> 00:16:33.167
center of his universe.

00:16:33.167 --> 00:16:35.467
So it's just beginning to look
a little odd, but the

00:16:35.467 --> 00:16:41.233
description in itself is not
especially dramatic or

00:16:41.233 --> 00:16:43.100
noticeable, really.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:50.367
But more towards the middle of
the story, in fact, after some

00:16:50.367 --> 00:16:54.133
things have happened, we know
that he missed his chance to

00:16:54.133 --> 00:16:55.767
marry Paula.

00:16:55.767 --> 00:17:00.133
He misses his chance
to marry Dolly.

00:17:00.133 --> 00:17:06.300
His life seems to be a catalogue
now of things that

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.733
are not done, the things that
he could've done, that he

00:17:09.733 --> 00:17:12.600
chooses not to do, or
that he perversely

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.967
allows not to happen.

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:18.333
It is beginning to
look that way.

00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:23.800
And it is at this moment that
the excessive devotion to the

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:29.067
Yale Club becomes almost a
summary of what kind of a

00:17:29.067 --> 00:17:31.067
person he is.

00:17:31.067 --> 00:17:35.533
"It was a hot Friday afternoon
in May, and as he walked on

00:17:35.533 --> 00:17:40.267
the pier, he realized that
Saturday closing had begun,

00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:43.500
and he was free until
Monday morning.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.800
'Go where?' he asked himself.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.067
The Yale Club, of course.

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:52.167
Bridge until dinner, then four
or five raw cocktails in

00:17:52.167 --> 00:17:57.700
somebody's room and a pleasant,
confused evening."

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:02.333
It's still quite neutral.

00:18:02.333 --> 00:18:09.567
It's not registering any shock
about this non-turn of events.

00:18:09.567 --> 00:18:12.533
Basically, nothing happens
in Anson's life.

00:18:12.533 --> 00:18:15.433
So all these things that could
have happened that would have

00:18:15.433 --> 00:18:18.733
been a significant development
in his life, significant

00:18:18.733 --> 00:18:22.767
turning points, all those
important turning points were

00:18:22.767 --> 00:18:25.933
roads not taken by Anson.

00:18:25.933 --> 00:18:28.733
And so he's still going
to the Yale Club.

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:33.100
But at this point, going to
the Yale Club becomes a

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.167
measure of the poverty
of his life.

00:18:36.167 --> 00:18:40.667
Before, it had been a tribute to
the fact that he's such an

00:18:40.667 --> 00:18:41.733
important presence there.

00:18:41.733 --> 00:18:44.533
He's a pillar of
the Yale Club.

00:18:44.533 --> 00:18:49.800
Now he's going there because he
doesn't have anything else.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:55.367
So it's a description from being
a plus in his life--

00:18:55.367 --> 00:18:58.833
something that he has on his
resume, that he's such an

00:18:58.833 --> 00:19:03.167
important figure at the Yale
Club-- from being a plus on

00:19:03.167 --> 00:19:09.567
his resume, it becomes not
exactly a minus, but a sign

00:19:09.567 --> 00:19:14.867
that things are just starting
not to go well for him or that

00:19:14.867 --> 00:19:18.333
we're beginning to see
that some things are

00:19:18.333 --> 00:19:19.200
beginning to go wrong.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:25.867
So it's an indication of a life
that is not taking shape

00:19:25.867 --> 00:19:27.600
as it should.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.200
And the story really is
about the possible

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.600
shapes of one's life.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.933
If Anson had married Paula, it
would've taken a very, very

00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:36.567
different shape.

00:19:36.567 --> 00:19:40.200
It's the fact that he doesn't
allow his life to take that

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.700
shape that it retains the
original shape, which I guess

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.933
is good in one sense-- it wasn't
such a bad shape to

00:19:46.933 --> 00:19:48.200
begin with--

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.667
but the fact remains that
there's absolutely no change

00:19:52.667 --> 00:19:56.433
in his life, that tomorrow is
going to be exactly like

00:19:56.433 --> 00:19:58.800
yesterday and like today.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.833
So this is the very
end of the story.

00:20:03.833 --> 00:20:06.233
And this is on a boat.

00:20:06.233 --> 00:20:11.467
And the narrator is actually
happy that things have--

00:20:11.467 --> 00:20:14.633
that this is how things
stand for Anson.

00:20:14.633 --> 00:20:18.367
"And he told me about the girl
in the red tam and his

00:20:18.367 --> 00:20:23.100
adventures with her, making them
all bizarre and amusing,

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:27.033
as he had a way of doing, and I
was glad that he was himself

00:20:27.033 --> 00:20:31.267
again, or at least the self that
I knew and with which I

00:20:31.267 --> 00:20:33.133
felt at home.

00:20:33.133 --> 00:20:36.333
I don't think he was ever happy
unless someone was in

00:20:36.333 --> 00:20:40.967
love with him, responding to
him, like filings to a magnet,

00:20:40.967 --> 00:20:43.267
helping him to explain himself,

00:20:43.267 --> 00:20:45.600
promising him something.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.600
What it was, I do not know.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.900
Perhaps they promised that there
would always be women in

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:56.167
the world who would spend the
highest, freshest, rarest

00:20:56.167 --> 00:21:00.400
hours to nurse that superiority
he cherished in

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.067
his heart."

00:21:02.067 --> 00:21:07.633
So it is in many ways a portrait
of a social type.

00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:15.033
It really comes back to that
recognizable social profile,

00:21:15.033 --> 00:21:21.033
someone who, because he has such
a large and guaranteed

00:21:21.033 --> 00:21:24.433
and very, very secure income--
he's very, very successful in

00:21:24.433 --> 00:21:29.733
his firm, and he's the pillar,
the head of his family--

00:21:29.733 --> 00:21:35.167
because so many things are a
given in his life, what is

00:21:35.167 --> 00:21:38.500
also a given is the
understanding that there would

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.233
always be a supply of women who
would gravitate towards

00:21:42.233 --> 00:21:46.000
him and be bowled over by him.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.467
People were still bowled over by
him if they'd just see him

00:21:49.467 --> 00:21:51.567
for the first time.

00:21:51.567 --> 00:21:55.667
And it's that capacity, that
knowledge, that certainty that

00:21:55.667 --> 00:21:59.100
there would always be women who
would be bowled over by

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:02.233
him that makes him what he is.

00:22:02.233 --> 00:22:05.967
So Fitzgerald's definition of
the rich boy extends far

00:22:05.967 --> 00:22:11.933
beyond the amount of money that
Anson Hunter has, even

00:22:11.933 --> 00:22:15.567
though that is not an
unimportant consideration.

00:22:15.567 --> 00:22:19.767
But it really is in many ways
the starting point for a whole

00:22:19.767 --> 00:22:24.867
psychological profile about
what it means when someone

00:22:24.867 --> 00:22:29.967
takes a lot of things for
granted and the ways in which

00:22:29.967 --> 00:22:34.400
taking so many things for
granted can actually be a

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.867
psychological liability.

00:22:36.867 --> 00:22:41.533
It's actually not good for us,
according to Fitzgerald, to be

00:22:41.533 --> 00:22:43.300
able to take so many things for
granted, especially for

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.200
people to take other human
beings for granted.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:50.767
And that is exactly the
most fundamental

00:22:50.767 --> 00:22:53.700
truth about Anson Hunter.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.500
So it is about a social type.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.000
There's no question about it.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.067
But there's the paradox that he
becomes almost kind of an

00:23:02.067 --> 00:23:08.267
extreme test case of a very
recognizable social profile.

00:23:08.267 --> 00:23:15.233
Just to show what a range
Fitzgerald has and the way

00:23:15.233 --> 00:23:21.633
that he can start at almost
exactly the same starting

00:23:21.633 --> 00:23:25.000
point but end up in a different
place, I thought

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.267
that maybe we should look at
"Babylon Revisited." It's also

00:23:29.267 --> 00:23:34.033
about a rich man, someone who's
never eaten in a cheap

00:23:34.033 --> 00:23:36.267
restaurant in Paris.

00:23:36.267 --> 00:23:39.133
I think that that really is
raising the bar very high.

00:23:39.133 --> 00:23:41.133
It's not like we go to
Paris every day.

00:23:41.133 --> 00:23:46.267
But never to have eaten in a
cheap restaurant in Paris, so

00:23:46.267 --> 00:23:51.167
that is the threshold
for Charlie.

00:23:51.167 --> 00:23:56.633
And it would be all too easy to
suggest, OK, here's another

00:23:56.633 --> 00:24:01.133
rich boy and this conformity
to type.

00:24:01.133 --> 00:24:04.733
What is also interesting about
Charlie is that he has in

00:24:04.733 --> 00:24:06.300
common with Anson the
fact that they

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.567
both are hard drinkers.

00:24:07.567 --> 00:24:09.833
So four or five martinis
is really nothing.

00:24:09.833 --> 00:24:10.567
It's just the norm.

00:24:10.567 --> 00:24:12.667
It's just the beginning,
really.

00:24:12.667 --> 00:24:17.567
So the hard drinking, the taking
things for granted, the

00:24:17.567 --> 00:24:21.533
lack of variety in the
experience, all of those

00:24:21.533 --> 00:24:22.667
things they have in common.

00:24:22.667 --> 00:24:25.333
Because they are so rich,
all of those things

00:24:25.333 --> 00:24:26.867
they have in common.

00:24:26.867 --> 00:24:33.033
But what is interesting about
Charlie is that, in fact, his

00:24:33.033 --> 00:24:37.100
life has a very, very different
trajectory from that

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:37.800
of Anson's.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.733
And it is actually
a happy ending.

00:24:39.733 --> 00:24:47.667
So let's see what happens at
the very end of Charlie's

00:24:47.667 --> 00:24:49.967
story, "Babylon Revisited."

00:24:49.967 --> 00:24:52.333
"He went back to his table.

00:24:52.333 --> 00:24:57.033
His whiskey glass was empty,
but he shook his head when

00:24:57.033 --> 00:25:00.867
Alix looked at it
questioningly.

00:25:00.867 --> 00:25:04.133
There wasn't much he could
do now except send

00:25:04.133 --> 00:25:06.100
Honoria some things.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:10.533
He would send her a lot
of things tomorrow.

00:25:10.533 --> 00:25:12.833
'No, no more,' he said
to another waiter.

00:25:12.833 --> 00:25:15.967
'What do I owe you?' He would
come back someday.

00:25:15.967 --> 00:25:17.967
They couldn't make
him pay forever.

00:25:17.967 --> 00:25:21.433
But he wanted his child, and
nothing was much good now

00:25:21.433 --> 00:25:22.900
beside that fact.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.467
He wasn't young anymore, with
a lot of nice thoughts and

00:25:26.467 --> 00:25:28.967
dreams to have by himself.

00:25:28.967 --> 00:25:32.933
He was absolutely sure Helen
wouldn't have wanted him to be

00:25:32.933 --> 00:25:34.100
so alone."

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:38.267
So right here, we can see a lot
of very, very important

00:25:38.267 --> 00:25:41.667
differences between
Charlie and Anson.

00:25:41.667 --> 00:25:45.767
The first thing we notice is
that this is someone who's

00:25:45.767 --> 00:25:47.700
stopped drinking.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.267
That is such an obvious fact
that it's almost embarrassing

00:25:50.267 --> 00:25:51.800
to point out, but there it is.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.533
It is very important for
Fitzgerald, who had a problem

00:25:54.533 --> 00:25:58.733
with alcoholism, that that
should be the case, that this

00:25:58.733 --> 00:26:04.933
person has enough self-control
to say no when it would have

00:26:04.933 --> 00:26:07.433
been so easy to say yes.

00:26:07.433 --> 00:26:11.867
But more than that, that
is actually just the

00:26:11.867 --> 00:26:15.900
manifestation of something being
different, is that he

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:20.033
has one very important
person in his life.

00:26:20.033 --> 00:26:23.533
And what is interesting is that
this is actually not a

00:26:23.533 --> 00:26:30.800
romantic interest. So what is
missing in Anson Hunter's life

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.800
is a child.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.100
And we know that Fitzgerald
himself had said many things

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.733
about his daughter, Scottie,
that it broke his heart to

00:26:39.733 --> 00:26:42.500
think that when Scottie grew up,
that his novels would no

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.867
longer be in print.

00:26:43.867 --> 00:26:45.533
He said that about
The Great Gatsby.

00:26:45.533 --> 00:26:49.900
So we do know that Fitzgerald
had a personal knowledge of

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.833
what it means to have a child
and to think about the future

00:26:53.833 --> 00:26:58.867
in terms of the future of that
child and wanting to share a

00:26:58.867 --> 00:27:00.500
future with that child.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.867
I think that that actually is
what gives him a future.

00:27:03.867 --> 00:27:09.067
So we're actually very close
to the world of To Have and

00:27:09.067 --> 00:27:15.067
Have Not, which is the future
appearing by virtue of the

00:27:15.067 --> 00:27:16.900
mediation of someone else.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:21.333
In this case, it is not Harry's
wife, Marie, who

00:27:21.333 --> 00:27:24.333
enables that future,
an affirmative

00:27:24.333 --> 00:27:26.367
future, to take shape.

00:27:26.367 --> 00:27:30.533
It is not his wife but his
daughter, Honoria.

00:27:30.533 --> 00:27:35.267
So his future is defined in
terms of today, I'm going to

00:27:35.267 --> 00:27:36.267
give her some things.

00:27:36.267 --> 00:27:39.033
Tomorrow, I'm going to give
her a lot more things.

00:27:39.033 --> 00:27:41.967
It's the pleasure of being able
to give his daughter a

00:27:41.967 --> 00:27:46.967
lot of presents, that is what
makes him work hard.

00:27:46.967 --> 00:27:49.667
He's very, very good at his
job making tons of money.

00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:53.467
He's very, very trusted
by his employers.

00:27:53.467 --> 00:27:58.433
It is all of that that's giving
him a certain kind of

00:27:58.433 --> 00:28:00.567
relation to time.

00:28:00.567 --> 00:28:06.967
So in that way, I think both
Hemingway and Faulkner are

00:28:06.967 --> 00:28:09.900
sort of implicitly present
in the story.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:15.233
It's how do we get to stop
being a social type?

00:28:15.233 --> 00:28:20.833
And how do we get to have
a personal and a highly

00:28:20.833 --> 00:28:24.267
interestingly populated relation
to the future?

00:28:24.267 --> 00:28:27.300
The future is not any
good unless it is

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.133
populated by something.

00:28:29.133 --> 00:28:33.133
And in this case, Charlie's
future is very much populated

00:28:33.133 --> 00:28:33.933
by his daughter.

00:28:33.933 --> 00:28:38.567
And that is because of the way
it is populated that he wants

00:28:38.567 --> 00:28:39.700
to get to that future.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.767
If it's not populated,
you might not

00:28:41.767 --> 00:28:42.667
even want to go there.

00:28:42.667 --> 00:28:44.333
You might want just to
stay where you are.

00:28:44.333 --> 00:28:47.333
But if it's populated in such
an interesting way, he does

00:28:47.333 --> 00:28:49.833
want to go there, and he wants
to go there with her.

00:28:49.833 --> 00:28:55.733
So this is the main difference
between Charlie and Anson.

00:28:55.733 --> 00:29:00.400
And what is also interesting
is it enables him to think

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:07.500
about his wife, Helen, who
died in very difficult

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.000
circumstances when they were
reconciled, but not really.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.033
It was not a good marriage.

00:29:12.033 --> 00:29:15.933
It was through the mediation of
his daughter that he's able

00:29:15.933 --> 00:29:20.667
to think about his wife, who
he had probably wronged in

00:29:20.667 --> 00:29:21.800
some sense.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.033
But she's dead now.

00:29:23.033 --> 00:29:26.333
There's no way for him
to right that wrong.

00:29:26.333 --> 00:29:29.433
So the only way he can right
that wrong that otherwise

00:29:29.433 --> 00:29:32.467
would have been permanent is
once again through the

00:29:32.467 --> 00:29:34.833
mediation of his daughter.

00:29:34.833 --> 00:29:38.867
So a mediated personal identity
and a mediated

00:29:38.867 --> 00:29:42.833
relation to the future.

00:29:42.833 --> 00:29:48.333
And so these are the two stories
that I should say that

00:29:48.333 --> 00:29:52.533
they have a lot in common in
terms of the narrative

00:29:52.533 --> 00:29:54.900
structure of the stories.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.367
Because even though it's a
happy ending for Charlie,

00:29:58.367 --> 00:30:05.367
because the future is going to
happen so slowly, it's a very

00:30:05.367 --> 00:30:08.967
slow happening, slow
pace, incremental

00:30:08.967 --> 00:30:10.833
emergence of tomorrow.

00:30:10.833 --> 00:30:14.367
He's going to give money
to his sister-in-law.

00:30:14.367 --> 00:30:16.733
That's the implication that's
how he would get

00:30:16.733 --> 00:30:17.900
his daughter back.

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.833
He's going to pay for
everything to get

00:30:19.833 --> 00:30:20.267
his daughter back.

00:30:20.267 --> 00:30:21.367
He's going to give his daughter

00:30:21.367 --> 00:30:23.067
lots and lots of presents.

00:30:23.067 --> 00:30:26.433
So all of that is going to
happen one day after another.

00:30:26.433 --> 00:30:29.267
There's not going to be a
dramatic change in his life.

00:30:29.267 --> 00:30:31.200
It's strictly incremental.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:37.100
But because it is steadily
incremental, we know that his

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.500
distant future will actually
be significantly different

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.233
from the today.

00:30:42.233 --> 00:30:45.867
But neither of those stories,
would I say,

00:30:45.867 --> 00:30:47.900
neither is really dramatic.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:52.800
So let's turn now to the other
side of the narrative

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.867
spectrum, two stories that are
very, very dramatic, and one

00:30:56.867 --> 00:30:59.833
advertising the drama in the
title, "The Diamond as Big as

00:30:59.833 --> 00:31:02.100
the Ritz."

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:05.600
So we know this is probably the
most famous short story by

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:10.133
Fitzgerald, and I would
encourage you to discuss in

00:31:10.133 --> 00:31:13.600
section whether or not that is
indeed your favorite story.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.000
It's certainly very,
very unforgettable.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.833
So this off-the-charts deviation
from an extreme type

00:31:21.833 --> 00:31:25.467
rich boy and drama on a large
scale, obviously.

00:31:25.467 --> 00:31:28.900
The catastrophe at the end of
the story, tomorrow is going

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:29.933
to be different today.

00:31:29.933 --> 00:31:33.900
But let's just look at the way
Fitzgerald proceeds to talk

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:38.700
about this very, very
extravagant world that really

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.700
truly is nothing like the
world as we know it.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.800
"St. Midas' School is half
an hour from Boston in a

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.700
Rolls-Pierce motorcar.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:53.467
The actual distance will never
be known, for no one except

00:31:53.467 --> 00:31:58.433
John T. Unger had ever arrived
there save in a Rolls-Pierce,

00:31:58.433 --> 00:32:01.067
and probably no one
will ever again."

00:32:01.067 --> 00:32:04.767
This is on the same page as
"never having eaten in a cheap

00:32:04.767 --> 00:32:09.200
restaurant in Paris."
So that is the norm.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:13.233
The norm itself is very,
very extreme.

00:32:13.233 --> 00:32:16.167
It's the most expensive boarding
school in the world,

00:32:16.167 --> 00:32:19.933
and it's unheard of for anyone
to go there and not owning a

00:32:19.933 --> 00:32:22.533
Rolls-Royce or Rolls-Pierce.

00:32:22.533 --> 00:32:26.400
So that is the baseline, a very,
very high threshold.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.233
But even on that very
high threshold,

00:32:30.233 --> 00:32:32.967
Percy is still a deviation.

00:32:32.967 --> 00:32:38.233
So it's definitely a deviation
from an extreme type.

00:32:38.233 --> 00:32:42.667
And one measure of that
deviation is the kind of car

00:32:42.667 --> 00:32:44.700
owned by the family.

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:50.333
So when they got to Montana,
John sees that there's this

00:32:50.333 --> 00:32:53.433
luminous disk that's
coming at him.

00:32:53.433 --> 00:32:55.400
He has no idea what that is.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.800
"Then as they came closer, John
saw that it was the tail

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:04.533
light of an immense automobile,
larger and more

00:33:04.533 --> 00:33:07.333
magnificent than anything
he had ever seen.

00:33:07.333 --> 00:33:11.733
Its body was of gleaming metal
richer than nickel and lighter

00:33:11.733 --> 00:33:15.433
than silver, and the hubs of the
wheels were studded with

00:33:15.433 --> 00:33:19.333
iridescent geometric figures
of green and yellow.

00:33:19.333 --> 00:33:22.500
John did not bear to guess
whether they were glass or

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.300
jewel."

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:28.533
I just want to stop for a
moment and talk about a

00:33:28.533 --> 00:33:32.900
possible paper topic that would
be perfect for the paper

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:38.633
that is ten pages, which is the
automobile in Fitzgerald

00:33:38.633 --> 00:33:39.733
and Faulkner.

00:33:39.733 --> 00:33:46.900
We know that Jason can't stand
the smell of gasoline, that he

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.367
has terrible headaches
because of his

00:33:49.367 --> 00:33:51.233
relation to the gasoline.

00:33:51.233 --> 00:33:54.967
So it's a very interesting take
on cars on Faulkner's

00:33:54.967 --> 00:33:58.233
part, and we know that
Fitzgerald certainly

00:33:58.233 --> 00:34:05.133
dramatizes and turns Gatsby's
Rolls-Royce into a surreal

00:34:05.133 --> 00:34:09.000
car, a mythic car.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.133
And here he's coming
back to that.

00:34:11.133 --> 00:34:16.500
So using the car as a very, very
concrete point of entry,

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:20.667
we can actually talk about very
large structures in both

00:34:20.667 --> 00:34:22.067
Faulkner and Fitzgerald.

00:34:22.067 --> 00:34:24.100
To what extent is
the Rolls-Royce

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:27.800
an emblem of Gatsby?

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:34.933
We also know that they saw
another car with two black men

00:34:34.933 --> 00:34:38.367
and a black woman in a car
driven by a white chauffeur.

00:34:38.367 --> 00:34:40.033
That's part of the
story as well.

00:34:40.033 --> 00:34:42.033
That's the configuration.

00:34:42.033 --> 00:34:47.333
So we can use the very concrete
object, a very

00:34:47.333 --> 00:34:51.000
well-defined object, the car,
and talk about the symbolic

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.767
constellation revolving
around that car.

00:34:54.767 --> 00:34:59.367
In the case of Fitzgerald,
definitely it would be a

00:34:59.367 --> 00:35:03.367
social landscape,
the Jazz Age.

00:35:03.367 --> 00:35:05.933
And in the case of Faulkner, it
actually has to go back to

00:35:05.933 --> 00:35:07.500
the relation between the
nineteenth century and the

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.267
twentieth century, so the
horse as a relic of the

00:35:10.267 --> 00:35:12.600
nineteenth century being played
off the automobile.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.333
So using the car, you can write
a great paper that would

00:35:16.333 --> 00:35:20.900
be very specific and that would
move from a small focus

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.700
to a large argument.

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.400
So I would encourage you in
writing your papers to think

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.700
of similar structures.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.433
Start from something extremely
well-defined and then move on

00:35:29.433 --> 00:35:31.100
to something larger.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:36.867
But in any case, as we can see,
actually, Fitzgerald is

00:35:36.867 --> 00:35:38.433
really fascinated
by the relation

00:35:38.433 --> 00:35:39.500
between cars and race.

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:46.867
So the car is memorable in
here, in this story, "The

00:35:46.867 --> 00:35:50.133
Diamond as Big as the Ritz." And
it turns out that it also

00:35:50.133 --> 00:35:53.933
has a very important
racial dimension.

00:35:53.933 --> 00:35:59.333
We know that the black
characters are still slaves in

00:35:59.333 --> 00:36:01.400
this story.

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:06.300
And they were originally brought
from the South, and

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.833
they had always been in the
possession of the family.

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:13.267
So this is what happens
to this black slave.

00:36:13.267 --> 00:36:17.367
"All these Negroes are
descendants of the ones my

00:36:17.367 --> 00:36:20.067
father brought north with him.

00:36:20.067 --> 00:36:23.633
There are about 250 now.

00:36:23.633 --> 00:36:27.967
You notice that they've lived
so long apart from the world

00:36:27.967 --> 00:36:32.067
that their original dialect
has become an almost

00:36:32.067 --> 00:36:33.833
indistinguishable patois."

00:36:33.833 --> 00:36:37.467
And he goes on to say that he
actually trains a few of them

00:36:37.467 --> 00:36:40.100
just to speak English so that
they can communicate with the

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:40.733
rest of the world.

00:36:40.733 --> 00:36:45.833
But all of the rest, the 250
of them, actually speak a

00:36:45.833 --> 00:36:51.267
patois, or a dialect, that has
no relation or is so far

00:36:51.267 --> 00:36:54.400
removed from English that it
would not be a recognizable

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.767
language to English speakers.

00:36:57.767 --> 00:37:03.233
So that in itself is almost like
a little local allegory

00:37:03.233 --> 00:37:12.000
for the relation of this
particular family, the

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:19.833
Washington family, and the
unsustainable relation between

00:37:19.833 --> 00:37:20.800
today and tomorrow.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:25.233
You can't keep on in the middle
of the United States

00:37:25.233 --> 00:37:29.267
speaking a language that is
supposedly English that really

00:37:29.267 --> 00:37:32.533
has no relation to the English
spoken by everyone else.

00:37:32.533 --> 00:37:37.133
It's just not a viable way of
living in the United States.

00:37:37.133 --> 00:37:39.867
Thinking that you're still
speaking English when yours

00:37:39.867 --> 00:37:42.600
isn't recognized as English
by anyone else is not a

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.467
sustainable linguistic
relation.

00:37:45.467 --> 00:37:51.533
And it's also an unsustainable
relation between this one

00:37:51.533 --> 00:37:56.367
closed world that wants to
remain closed and the rest of

00:37:56.367 --> 00:38:00.700
the United States that is
dynamically expanding and also

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:07.133
trying to integrate all locales
into a national grid.

00:38:07.133 --> 00:38:12.733
So this is what happens when
we notice that there's one

00:38:12.733 --> 00:38:17.400
important aspect of the
Washington family that is

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.300
clearly not going
to last forever.

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:24.200
And this patois is not going
to last forever.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.300
It's going to die out.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.533
It's going to be contaminated
by the

00:38:27.533 --> 00:38:30.133
living English language.

00:38:30.133 --> 00:38:33.833
That this is going to die out,
what else is going to die out

00:38:33.833 --> 00:38:35.800
about the family?

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.600
What else is going to die out
about this particular setup,

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.900
this closed world that
fantasizes about

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:43.500
being closed forever?

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:48.000
And we see very soon that in
fact the end is going to come

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.100
faster than we think.

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:54.233
It only takes a few pages,
really, for the end to arrive,

00:38:54.233 --> 00:38:59.567
and it's drama on a very,
very large scale indeed.

00:38:59.567 --> 00:39:03.733
"Simultaneously, and with an
immense concussion, the

00:39:03.733 --> 00:39:08.133
chateau literally threw itself
into the air, bursting into

00:39:08.133 --> 00:39:12.233
flaming fragments as it rose,
and then tumbling back upon

00:39:12.233 --> 00:39:16.333
itself in a smoking pile that
lay projecting half into the

00:39:16.333 --> 00:39:18.000
water of the lake.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.400
There was no fire.

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.067
What smoke there was drifted
off mingling with the

00:39:22.067 --> 00:39:26.433
sunshine, and for a few minutes
longer, a powdery dust

00:39:26.433 --> 00:39:30.733
of marble drifted from the great
featureless pile that

00:39:30.733 --> 00:39:33.833
had once been the
house of jewels.

00:39:33.833 --> 00:39:36.867
There was no more sound, and the
three people were alone in

00:39:36.867 --> 00:39:38.167
the valley."

00:39:38.167 --> 00:39:43.767
So the ending in many ways
is not surprising.

00:39:43.767 --> 00:39:47.433
It's a very interesting
combination.

00:39:47.433 --> 00:39:50.933
On the one hand, it's
highly dramatic.

00:39:50.933 --> 00:39:55.667
On the other hand, there's an
element of predictability to

00:39:55.667 --> 00:39:56.367
that drama.

00:39:56.367 --> 00:40:00.100
We almost know that some
catastrophe is going to happen

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.467
at the end of the story.

00:40:02.467 --> 00:40:05.467
And I think that Fitzgerald is
actually very comfortable with

00:40:05.467 --> 00:40:09.100
that kind of combination,
high drama, but

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:11.700
with almost no suspense.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.700
We know almost from the very
beginning that probably

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:16.667
something very, very bad
is going to happen at

00:40:16.667 --> 00:40:19.633
the end of the story.

00:40:19.633 --> 00:40:24.233
And we also know from the very
desolate landscape at the end

00:40:24.233 --> 00:40:28.233
of the story that the tomorrow
is going to be totally

00:40:28.233 --> 00:40:33.833
different from the today
within the story.

00:40:33.833 --> 00:40:39.500
So I have to confess that I like
this story a lot, but I

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:42.833
actually like drama on
a smaller scale.

00:40:42.833 --> 00:40:49.433
So "Bernice Bobs Her Hair" is
actually my favorite story

00:40:49.433 --> 00:40:52.333
among the Fitzgerald stories.

00:40:52.333 --> 00:40:55.100
And I hope that you'll
see why.

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:58.367
It's about reversion
to an original type

00:40:58.367 --> 00:40:59.800
and an unknown future.

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:05.433
So Fitzgerald I think really
liked the story as well, so

00:41:05.433 --> 00:41:10.400
that is the story that is
featured on the cover of the

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:14.600
collection of short stories
Flappers and Philosophers.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:20.500
And if the word "flapper," if
that doesn't ring a bell right

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:24.933
away, this is an image of the
very famous flappers of the

00:41:24.933 --> 00:41:29.733
1920s, people who bobbed their
hair and wear short skirts,

00:41:29.733 --> 00:41:32.433
show their legs, and so on.

00:41:32.433 --> 00:41:33.667
So the flapper.

00:41:35.667 --> 00:41:38.867
So you guys know that the story
is really about someone

00:41:38.867 --> 00:41:40.733
who's becoming a flapper.

00:41:40.733 --> 00:41:42.267
Bernice is going to--

00:41:42.267 --> 00:41:46.300
has in fact cut off all her
beautiful hair, tons and tons

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:50.167
of hair, has it cut off.

00:41:50.167 --> 00:41:51.800
But it turns out that
that's exactly the

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.267
wrong hairdo for her.

00:41:54.267 --> 00:41:59.900
She's very, very ugly after
that, and her beaus stop--

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:03.067
her beaus lose all
interest in her.

00:42:03.067 --> 00:42:08.100
And she has one person
to thank, her cousin.

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:12.767
So this is what happens to the
person that she has to thank.

00:42:18.667 --> 00:42:22.967
Her cousin, Marjorie, is
sleeping, and this is what

00:42:22.967 --> 00:42:25.000
happens to Marjorie
when she's asleep.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.433
"Bernice deftly amputated the
other braid, paused for an

00:42:29.433 --> 00:42:33.167
instant, and then flitted
swiftly and silently back to

00:42:33.167 --> 00:42:34.000
her own room.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.567
After a minute's brisk walk, she
discovered that her left

00:42:37.567 --> 00:42:41.067
hand still held the
two blond braids.

00:42:41.067 --> 00:42:44.733
She laughed unexpectedly, had to
shut her mouth hard to keep

00:42:44.733 --> 00:42:48.033
from emitting an
absolute peal.

00:42:48.033 --> 00:42:52.033
She was passing Warren's house
now, and on the impulse, she

00:42:52.033 --> 00:42:55.500
set down her baggage, and
swinging the braids like

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:59.000
pieces of rope flung them at the
wooden porch, where they

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.067
landed with a slight thud.

00:43:01.067 --> 00:43:05.333
She laughed again, no longer
restraining herself. 'Huh!'

00:43:05.333 --> 00:43:06.633
she giggled wildly.

00:43:06.633 --> 00:43:09.467
'Scalp the selfish thing!'"

00:43:09.467 --> 00:43:12.900
So it really is in one
sense no big deal.

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:13.733
Hair will grow out.

00:43:13.733 --> 00:43:15.800
Bernice's hair will grow out.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.433
Marjorie's hair will
also grow out.

00:43:17.433 --> 00:43:20.400
So cutting off somebody's braids
is not like the end of

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.467
the world, as it is in "The
Diamond as Big as the Ritz."

00:43:23.467 --> 00:43:26.433
But still it's an interesting
kind of drama.

00:43:26.433 --> 00:43:30.033
And what makes the drama
especially interesting is the

00:43:30.033 --> 00:43:35.667
fact that Bernice actually uses
the word "scalp," which

00:43:35.667 --> 00:43:39.567
is a word not used in the
twentieth century.

00:43:39.567 --> 00:43:42.800
It goes all the way back to
the nineteenth century,

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.300
eighteenth century.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:47.200
It had to do with a Native
American practice.

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:51.867
So in order to understand this
odd use of language, I think

00:43:51.867 --> 00:43:55.900
that we need to, with the help
of another sociologist and

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:58.967
anthropologist, very well
known, one of the most

00:43:58.967 --> 00:44:04.233
important thinkers, really, in
the late nineteenth century

00:44:04.233 --> 00:44:07.033
extending into the twentieth
century, many authors--

00:44:07.033 --> 00:44:08.867
Zora Neale Hurston actually
studied with

00:44:08.867 --> 00:44:11.200
Franz Boas at Columbia.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:19.767
So Franz Boas had an interesting
argument about

00:44:19.767 --> 00:44:21.733
human types as well.

00:44:21.733 --> 00:44:24.733
And it turns out that he
is turning the notion

00:44:24.733 --> 00:44:26.867
of type on its head.

00:44:26.867 --> 00:44:30.667
And this is what he
says in 1911.

00:44:30.667 --> 00:44:35.700
"When, for instance, it is
claimed that certain types of

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:40.933
Europeans show better mental
endowment than other types of

00:44:40.933 --> 00:44:46.567
Europeans, the assumption is
that these types are stable

00:44:46.567 --> 00:44:50.367
and cannot undergo far-reaching
changes when

00:44:50.367 --> 00:44:55.167
placed in a new social or
geographical environment.

00:44:55.167 --> 00:44:58.700
An investigation of this
problem shows that the

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:04.067
assumption of an absolute
stability of human types is

00:45:04.067 --> 00:45:05.367
not plausible."

00:45:05.367 --> 00:45:08.933
So Franz Boas says that, OK, it
looks like-- on the face of

00:45:08.933 --> 00:45:10.300
it, it looks like there
are different

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:11.267
types of human beings.

00:45:11.267 --> 00:45:15.200
And yes, when we look at human
faces, there really are

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.467
different human types,
clearly undeniable.

00:45:18.467 --> 00:45:21.867
But he doesn't think that
there's any permanence to

00:45:21.867 --> 00:45:25.033
those types, that in fact, even
though you might be born

00:45:25.033 --> 00:45:29.433
into one type, when you're put
in a different social or

00:45:29.433 --> 00:45:33.833
geographical environment,
that type actually

00:45:33.833 --> 00:45:35.133
gets radically modified.

00:45:35.133 --> 00:45:38.867
So it is very much an argument
about the importance of

00:45:38.867 --> 00:45:43.767
environmental input and the way
it can change your initial

00:45:43.767 --> 00:45:45.433
genetic makeup.

00:45:45.433 --> 00:45:51.933
And to prove his point, Franz
Boas actually became a

00:45:51.933 --> 00:45:57.667
performance artist. So this is
Franz Boas dressed up as an

00:45:57.667 --> 00:46:01.500
Inuit, otherwise known
as Eskimo --

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:05.000
to show that, yes, a Caucasian
man can look

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.267
just like an Inuit.

00:46:07.267 --> 00:46:12.600
And here he is dressed up or
not dressed up at all as a

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:16.933
Native American and proving
that, yes, a Caucasian can

00:46:16.933 --> 00:46:19.533
look like a Native American.

00:46:19.533 --> 00:46:25.700
There is no permanent social
type, no permanent biological

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.233
or genetic type.

00:46:27.233 --> 00:46:31.600
There's the constant shifting
of boundaries among those

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:36.400
types as well as the possibility
of the person of

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:40.600
one type taking on the identity
of another type.

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:45.267
So I think that that is the
context for understanding the

00:46:45.267 --> 00:46:49.200
very odd use of the
word "scalp"

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.133
on the part of Bernice.

00:46:51.133 --> 00:46:55.367
And it turns out that Fitzgerald
has actually

00:46:55.367 --> 00:46:58.400
prepared us for that
development.

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:01.433
Much earlier in the story, when
they were actually just

00:47:01.433 --> 00:47:02.833
talking about--

00:47:02.833 --> 00:47:06.433
Bernice is being totally dull
and having nothing interesting

00:47:06.433 --> 00:47:09.200
to say and just sitting around
all day and doing nothing and

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.233
being totally boring.

00:47:11.233 --> 00:47:17.700
When they were talking about her
in that context, Marjorie

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:21.833
actually has this interesting
theory, that maybe she's so

00:47:21.833 --> 00:47:26.333
dull and boring and submissive
because she's just like one of

00:47:26.333 --> 00:47:28.333
the Native American women.

00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:32.833
"'I think it is that crazy
Indian blood in Bernice,'

00:47:32.833 --> 00:47:34.033
continued Marjorie."

00:47:34.033 --> 00:47:36.567
So when she was saying that,
making that observation at

00:47:36.567 --> 00:47:40.733
that point, is that Bernice
is really like the Native

00:47:40.733 --> 00:47:42.900
American women.

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:47.967
But it turns out that, yes, she
has some Indian blood in

00:47:47.967 --> 00:47:52.533
her, but what she resembles is
not the Indian woman but the

00:47:52.533 --> 00:47:54.267
Indian warrior.

00:47:54.267 --> 00:48:00.267
And that is really what's coming
out in that dramatic

00:48:00.267 --> 00:48:04.333
amputation of Marjorie's
braids.

00:48:04.333 --> 00:48:08.800
So the language, of course,
is mock-heroic.

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.400
It is using the language of
high drama to talk about

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:16.333
something that really is
a very small incident.

00:48:16.333 --> 00:48:20.400
But nonetheless, it's a very
interesting story, and it's

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.733
the only story where we
don't know what the

00:48:23.733 --> 00:48:26.133
future is going to be.

00:48:26.133 --> 00:48:29.467
That Bernice has done this
thing that is out of

00:48:29.467 --> 00:48:34.633
character, we just don't know
what the future will hold,

00:48:34.633 --> 00:48:38.700
whether she will keep on this
path, that this is just the

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:42.967
beginning of a new career and
a new personal identity for

00:48:42.967 --> 00:48:45.500
her, or whether she would revert
actually back to the

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:49.367
very quiet, very submissive
type that she was before.

00:48:49.367 --> 00:48:53.100
So this is the only story, I
think, where we truly don't

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:57.467
know if the tomorrow is going
to resemble today.

00:48:57.467 --> 00:49:00.933
And I think that it has to
do partly with that very

00:49:00.933 --> 00:49:05.633
unexpected reversion to
an original type.

00:49:05.633 --> 00:49:09.867
So the least we can say is that
Fitzgerald is someone who

00:49:09.867 --> 00:49:13.800
really plays on all the possible
permutations of

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:14.233
social types.

00:49:14.233 --> 00:49:18.067
I can't think of anybody more
inventive or having more to

00:49:18.067 --> 00:49:21.067
bring to that kind
of permutation.

00:49:21.067 --> 00:49:25.500
So we're done with Fitzgerald,
and on Thursday, we'll move on

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.133
to Faulkner and As I Lay Dying.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.890
Prof: Okay,
let's start in.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.250
Got a fairly large agenda today.
 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.328
And I wanted to remind you that
next week, we're moving on to

00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:16.280
air quality.
 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:22.091
So check your syllabus and read
the material for section next

00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:22.770
week.
 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.220
And today I want to talk about
two principles in law,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.440
one being preemption and the
other being defamation,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.400
and to give you a couple of
case histories.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.262
And I'm going to start out
talking about Bates v.

00:00:38.262 --> 00:00:39.020
Dow.
 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.256
And then I want to talk about
two cases, one,

00:00:43.256 --> 00:00:48.166
product disparagement,
and the other one is known as

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.900
the Alar case.
 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.778
And another is a case that was
brought by the Texas Cattlemen's

00:00:53.778 --> 00:00:56.030
Association against Oprah
Winfrey.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.890
And I'll show you a couple of
video clips of that.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.512
First of all,
preemption has its origin in

00:01:05.512 --> 00:01:08.819
the Constitution,
within the supremacy clause

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:10.826
that states,
"This Constitution and the

00:01:10.826 --> 00:01:11.489
laws of the U.S.
 

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:14.477
shall be the supreme law of the
land, and the judges in every

00:01:14.477 --> 00:01:16.319
state shall be bound
thereby."

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:20.566
So that within air quality law,
within pesticide management

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:23.438
law,
within pharmaceutical law,

00:01:23.438 --> 00:01:26.296
tobacco law,
occupational law,

00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:31.617
states are prohibited from
adopting certain standards that

00:01:31.617 --> 00:01:35.819
are different than the federal
government.

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:40.128
And the purpose behind this is
not to create a patchwork quilt

00:01:40.128 --> 00:01:44.084
that is really comprised of
non-uniform standards so that

00:01:44.084 --> 00:01:48.534
when corporations wish to trade
goods or provide services across

00:01:48.534 --> 00:01:51.690
state boundaries,
they basically have the

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.580
expectations.
 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.304
It's often applied to
situations that are risky or

00:01:56.304 --> 00:01:58.280
products that are risky.
 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.129
And the failure to warn is
often a key question.

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:04.769
And we'll raise that in the
case today.

00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:08.490
With respect to pesticides,
Congress traditionally deferred

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.889
to states to regulate threats to
health and safety.

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:15.337
But since 1970,
it's exercised its power to

00:02:15.337 --> 00:02:20.098
preempt state or local
regulation in a number of areas,

00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:25.288
particularly with respect to
warning labels on pesticides.

00:02:25.288 --> 00:02:28.360
So there are a variety of
theories of damage recovery.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.783
So if you imagine that say
someone comes to your home and

00:02:33.783 --> 00:02:39.596
promises to give you a green
lawn by applying fertilizers and

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:43.979
insecticides,
and all of a sudden you notice

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:47.150
an acrid taste in your well
water,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.800
and also your children start to
feel awkward or strange.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.797
And you find out that the
chemicals that were applied were

00:02:57.797 --> 00:02:59.060
neurotoxic substances.
 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.860
And what are your rights?
 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.770
Basically, you could argue
that-- we have percussion

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.513
section out there on the street,
throwing I think rocks or

00:03:11.513 --> 00:03:13.930
bricks into one of these big
metal barrels.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.550
So I apologize for that.
 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.403
So you can imagine yourself in
a situation where you conclude

00:03:20.403 --> 00:03:23.680
that federal law didn't protect
you against that.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.068
You feel like you've been
damaged.

00:03:25.068 --> 00:03:28.122
It's going to cost you money to
either drill a new well or to

00:03:28.122 --> 00:03:29.598
put infiltration equipment.
 

00:03:29.598 --> 00:03:32.300
And what about the health
effects on your family?

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.120
So there are a variety of
theories of damage recovery.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.610
And one is that the failure to
warn provides a justification

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.199
for seeking recovery of damages.
 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:49.615
So remember what I argued about
the difficulty that most people

00:03:49.615 --> 00:03:53.110
have in understanding warning
labels,

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.129
the difficulty of taking
complicated scientific

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.675
information and reducing it in a
way that would make it

00:03:59.675 --> 00:04:03.025
intelligible and make you
capable of knowing how you

00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:05.979
should behave in order to
prevent risk.

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.919
For example,
should you be responsible to

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:13.403
know that you have sandy soils
and that your well is a shallow

00:04:13.403 --> 00:04:14.979
well,
and it's an old well,

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:16.060
and the casing is cracked?
 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.579
I mean, are you really
responsible to know that?

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.089
Should that information be on a
warning label?

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:24.120
Negligence is another theory
for recovery.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.375
So was the product made in a
negligent way or was it used in

00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:30.980
a negligent way?
 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.959
How about design defects?
 

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:36.550
Listening to Good Morning
America today,

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.949
I was intrigued by litigation
that is growing,

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:45.161
class action suits against
Toyota because of their

00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:49.500
accelerator pad catching,
or brake defects.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.627
So some defect in production or
design that leads to a higher

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:59.668
level, higher concentration of
risk or hazard and subsequent

00:04:59.668 --> 00:05:00.610
damage.
 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.850
How about failure to disclose
incident reports?

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.353
So that Dow Chemical Company
was fined nearly $800,000

00:05:08.353 --> 00:05:13.367
because it had been reported to
Dow by a variety of families

00:05:13.367 --> 00:05:17.956
that they felt that they had
medical problems that were

00:05:17.956 --> 00:05:21.610
associated with using their
products.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.083
And they were required under
federal pesticide law to report

00:05:26.083 --> 00:05:30.860
those incidents back to the
Environmental Protection Agency,

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.500
and they did not do so within
the time limit,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.139
there was a significant delay.
 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:38.410
So the failure to disclose
incident reports.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.759
And again, with the auto
defects that we're witnessing in

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:49.779
the press and in the showrooms
today, the same issue applies.

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:54.190
So when did the corporation
know that the pedals stuck or

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.129
that the brake system was not
working correctly?

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:02.293
So the failure to report back
to government agencies that have

00:06:02.293 --> 00:06:06.634
regulatory responsibilities,
whether it's pharmaceuticals or

00:06:06.634 --> 00:06:09.720
cars or pesticides or cosmetics
or foods,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.560
these generally carry
significant penalties.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.451
And because of preemption
that's built into pesticide law

00:06:18.451 --> 00:06:23.449
and air quality law,
et cetera, states have often

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:29.752
denied access to courts to use
these theories of recovery to

00:06:29.752 --> 00:06:32.209
secure compensation.
 

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:37.519
So the state courts have often
not agreed to hear the cases.

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:39.379
This is why Bates v.
 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:41.399
Dow is so important.
 

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:45.798
Bates is a case in which
twenty-nine peanut growers in

00:06:45.798 --> 00:06:49.865
Texas alleged that Dow
AgroSciences had produced a

00:06:49.865 --> 00:06:52.440
chemical called Strong Arm.
 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.285
Strong Arm, they claimed
damaged their peanut plants back

00:06:57.285 --> 00:06:58.930
in the year 2000.
 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.687
And the pesticide label itself
claimed that "Use of Strong

00:07:03.687 --> 00:07:08.600
Arm is recommended in all areas
where peanuts are grown."

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.050
Now, when it was used in the
Texas peanut farmland,

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.449
where the soils exceeded a pH
of seven point two,

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:18.612
it damaged both the peanut
crop, and it failed to control

00:07:18.612 --> 00:07:19.290
the weeds.
 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.545
So the activity of this
chemical is mediated by the

00:07:23.545 --> 00:07:25.420
acidity of the soil.
 

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.800
And by 2001,
EPA had approved a new label

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.656
for the chemical,
including a new warning,

00:07:31.656 --> 00:07:34.379
"Do not apply Strong Arm
to soils with a pH of seven

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:35.839
point two or greater."
 

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:38.980
So this case was decided in
2005.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:45.437
This label was in force for
four years before the decision

00:07:45.437 --> 00:07:46.230
date.
 

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.420
So eventually,
the case wound its way up to

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.940
the Supreme Court.
 

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.839
And this is quite a feat.
 

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:57.396
In many instances,
claims that are brought in

00:07:57.396 --> 00:08:02.329
state courts do not make their
way up to the Supreme Court.

00:08:02.329 --> 00:08:06.201
It can often take decades or
even a half a century before a

00:08:06.201 --> 00:08:09.738
case is believed to be
appropriate for judicial review

00:08:09.738 --> 00:08:12.410
by the highest court in the
country.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.012
So they found that
"Congress surely would have

00:08:15.012 --> 00:08:17.666
expressed its intent more
clearly of it had meant to

00:08:17.666 --> 00:08:20.269
deprive injured parties of a
long-available form of

00:08:20.269 --> 00:08:21.259
compensation.
 

00:08:21.259 --> 00:08:23.961
Moreover, this history
emphasizes the importance of

00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:26.985
providing an incentive to
manufacturers to use the utmost

00:08:26.985 --> 00:08:30.120
care in distributing inherently
dangerous items."

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.275
In other words,
the Supreme Court was looking

00:08:34.275 --> 00:08:39.000
at these lawsuits to seek
recovery as really a last

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.038
resort.
 

00:08:40.038 --> 00:08:42.750
So it represents the failure of
federal law,

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:46.432
it represents the failure of
state law or local law to offer

00:08:46.432 --> 00:08:49.615
sufficient environmental
protection or protection of

00:08:49.615 --> 00:08:50.740
public health.
 

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.038
So what's a damaged party to do?
 

00:08:53.038 --> 00:08:55.360
What are you going to do if
you've been damaged?

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.908
Well, you probably would
consider litigation.

00:08:58.908 --> 00:09:02.825
So the Supreme Court continued,
"It seems unlikely that

00:09:02.825 --> 00:09:06.938
Congress considered a relatively
obscure provision like Section

00:09:06.938 --> 00:09:10.589
136VB (which is the preemption
clause) to give pesticide

00:09:10.589 --> 00:09:14.304
manufacturers virtual immunity
from certain forms of tort

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:15.500
liability.
 

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.370
And we've been pointed to no
evidence that such tort suits

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:22.836
led to a crazy quilt of FIFRA
(federal pesticide law

00:09:22.836 --> 00:09:26.368
standards) or otherwise created
any real hardship for

00:09:26.368 --> 00:09:28.610
manufacturers or EPA."
 

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:33.126
So the argument that you would
have an uneven regulatory

00:09:33.126 --> 00:09:37.808
playing field among the states
had no substance to it,

00:09:37.808 --> 00:09:43.437
or that the manufacturers would
be damaged significantly by

00:09:43.437 --> 00:09:46.952
these claims,
because they're expensive,

00:09:46.952 --> 00:09:51.428
they're time consuming,
and few people actually have

00:09:51.428 --> 00:09:55.960
the resources or capacity to
bring the lawsuits.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.849
So central questions today
really will involve a question

00:09:58.849 --> 00:10:02.048
of freedom of speech and when is
it appropriate to limit speech

00:10:02.048 --> 00:10:04.320
about environmental and health
hazards,

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.408
intellectual property rights.
 

00:10:06.408 --> 00:10:11.600
Who should own the right to
knowledge of risk?

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:18.288
Should corporations be capable
of holding that as a secret?

00:10:18.288 --> 00:10:22.423
Or should they be obligated to
disclose that to the public in

00:10:22.423 --> 00:10:26.351
the form of a warning label or a
disclosure of an incident

00:10:26.351 --> 00:10:27.110
report?
 

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.210
What should the standard of
proof be?

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:33.480
And how should the falsity of a
statement be judged?

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.149
The falsity of a statement on a
label or the falsity of a

00:10:37.149 --> 00:10:40.950
statement made by a party that
is challenging a corporation

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:44.620
that they were damaged by
exposure to their product?

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.220
And where should the burden of
proof lie?

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.841
Should the burden of proof lie
with the plaintiff to prove the

00:10:49.841 --> 00:10:52.929
falsity of criticism,
or the defendant to prove truth

00:10:52.929 --> 00:10:53.940
of criticism?
 

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:58.946
And to explore this area of
product disparagement more

00:10:58.946 --> 00:11:02.820
fully, I want you to consider
one case.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.879
This is a case of a chemical
known as Alar that you probably

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:09.678
did not experience.
 

00:11:09.678 --> 00:11:13.730
But it was in wide use in the
United States and in different

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:17.299
parts of the world back in the
1980s and early 1990s,

00:11:17.299 --> 00:11:19.360
and it was used on apples.
 

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.302
And it was used on apple
orchards basically to cause stem

00:11:23.302 --> 00:11:25.855
thickening,
so it would hold the apple on

00:11:25.855 --> 00:11:29.096
the tree longer and it would
keep the apple from falling down

00:11:29.096 --> 00:11:30.340
and getting bruised.
 

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.408
So it would maintain the
commercial quality and the grade

00:11:33.408 --> 00:11:34.230
of the apple.
 

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.100
And it would also cause uniform
ripening.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.860
Uniform ripening is important,
because you don't want part of

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.570
a tree,
perhaps that's facing the

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.239
sunshine,
to have apples that are ripe

00:11:44.239 --> 00:11:49.082
and then all the apples that are
on the north side of the tree in

00:11:49.082 --> 00:11:51.960
more shade that would remain
green.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:56.539
So it provided economic
advantage to orchard owners in a

00:11:56.539 --> 00:11:58.038
variety of ways.
 

00:11:58.038 --> 00:12:02.100
This is a systemic compound,
which is interesting.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:06.020
It means that it's absorbed up
through the plant roots itself

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.590
into the plant tissue.
 

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.811
So you may think that some
residues are only on the surface

00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:14.254
of a fruit or a vegetable and if
you peel it or if you wash it,

00:12:14.254 --> 00:12:15.808
you could get rid of it.
 

00:12:15.808 --> 00:12:20.726
Here's an example of a compound
that that would not be helpful

00:12:20.726 --> 00:12:21.210
for.
 

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.070
It's not easy to detect.
 

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:28.568
When this chemical was being
reviewed and became a public

00:12:28.568 --> 00:12:32.889
target for criticism of its
manufacturer,

00:12:32.889 --> 00:12:35.288
I went up to the state of
Massachusetts,

00:12:35.288 --> 00:12:37.254
because the state of
Massachusetts was trying to

00:12:37.254 --> 00:12:39.470
figure out if they were going to
ban the compound,

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:42.970
as it was detected increasingly
in foods.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.798
And I went to their
laboratories,

00:12:44.798 --> 00:12:47.996
their state laboratories,
and they had not even developed

00:12:47.996 --> 00:12:49.538
a detection method yet.
 

00:12:49.538 --> 00:12:52.549
Speaking to their analytic
chemists, they didn't even know

00:12:52.549 --> 00:12:54.029
how to find this in foods.
 

00:12:54.029 --> 00:12:56.210
So think about that for a
minute.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:00.202
What that means is that the
government approved the use of a

00:13:00.202 --> 00:13:03.924
chemical on certain crops when
it knew that there was no

00:13:03.924 --> 00:13:07.918
accepted method for detecting it
in the food or in processed

00:13:07.918 --> 00:13:11.640
forms of the food or in water
supplies if it happened to

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.009
contaminate water supplies.
 

00:13:14.009 --> 00:13:18.543
So that's quite curious and it
might give you some ideas about

00:13:18.543 --> 00:13:22.778
prior requirements before
introducing new technologies.

00:13:22.778 --> 00:13:29.149
So it has an unusual
characteristic.

00:13:29.149 --> 00:13:32.404
It produces unsymmetrical
dimethylhydrazine,

00:13:32.404 --> 00:13:35.962
UDMH, which is also a space
shuttle rocket fuel,

00:13:35.962 --> 00:13:40.429
but only under conditions where
the chemical is heated.

00:13:40.429 --> 00:13:42.860
Now where would food be heated?
 

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.509
Well, it's commonly heated when
it's processed or when it's

00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:47.389
pasteurized.
 

00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:51.152
So when you take an apple and
you grind it up and you squeeze

00:13:51.152 --> 00:13:54.100
all the juice out of it to make
apple juice,

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:59.563
it's commonly heated up for the
purposes of killing bacteria and

00:13:59.563 --> 00:14:01.820
protecting human health.
 

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.423
Apple juice in the 1980s was
also exploding into the

00:14:05.423 --> 00:14:08.957
marketplace, in part because of
different packaging

00:14:08.957 --> 00:14:10.158
technologies.
 

00:14:10.158 --> 00:14:13.928
So it used to be available in
large glass bottles,

00:14:13.928 --> 00:14:18.264
but the advent of juice boxes
so that children would take

00:14:18.264 --> 00:14:22.832
these flavored juices to school
on a routine basis in really

00:14:22.832 --> 00:14:26.240
small cardboard and plastic
containers,

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.639
it caused apple juice
consumption to skyrocket.

00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:33.421
So that apple juice,
within a matter of a decade,

00:14:33.421 --> 00:14:37.595
became one of the more heavily
consumed foods by young

00:14:37.595 --> 00:14:38.620
children.
 

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.615
So it was introduced by
Uniroyal in 1966 and registered

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:46.388
by the Department of
Agriculture, because EPA wasn't

00:14:46.388 --> 00:14:48.460
in existence until 1970.
 

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:52.474
And in 1973,
it was found to produce cancer

00:14:52.474 --> 00:14:53.428
in mice.
 

00:14:53.428 --> 00:14:57.009
Between 1977 and '78,
the National Cancer Institute

00:14:57.009 --> 00:14:59.730
found that that study was
credible,

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:02.985
and they conducted their own
studies that found carcinogenic

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:06.241
effects in animals,
raising the question how should

00:15:06.241 --> 00:15:08.678
we look at data from animal
testing?

00:15:08.678 --> 00:15:12.308
And what should we infer from
that about human health risk?

00:15:12.308 --> 00:15:15.360
Well, during conservative
political administrations,

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.522
we've tended as a society not
to worry too much about these

00:15:19.522 --> 00:15:22.678
low level cancer risks in the
food supply.

00:15:22.678 --> 00:15:24.570
But remember that at this point
in time,

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:28.288
the Delaney Clause in the Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act was in

00:15:28.288 --> 00:15:31.817
place that had what was called
the de minimis risk

00:15:31.817 --> 00:15:33.519
standard built into it.
 

00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:36.998
So it also had the Food and
Drug Administration that was

00:15:36.998 --> 00:15:40.222
interpreting the de
minimis standard to allow

00:15:40.222 --> 00:15:42.879
low levels of risk in the food
supply.

00:15:42.879 --> 00:15:47.183
So EPA concluded eventually in
1980 that it was carcinogenic

00:15:47.183 --> 00:15:50.904
and then negotiated with
Uniroyal for several years,

00:15:50.904 --> 00:15:53.240
and that produced no action.
 

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.200
In 1985, they found that both
Alar,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.019
which is the parent compound
and the metabolite,

00:15:59.019 --> 00:16:02.259
the UDMH, was a "probable
human" carcinogen.

00:16:02.259 --> 00:16:05.009
So this is the next step up in
the level of concern.

00:16:05.009 --> 00:16:07.303
It's not just an animal
carcinogen--it's "probable

00:16:07.303 --> 00:16:07.899
human."
 

00:16:07.899 --> 00:16:10.207
The next step up,
by the way, is "known

00:16:10.207 --> 00:16:11.548
human carcinogen."
 

00:16:11.548 --> 00:16:15.221
And there are more than a
hundred now compounds that are

00:16:15.221 --> 00:16:18.158
characterized as known human
carcinogens,

00:16:18.158 --> 00:16:21.326
such as benzene and
1,3-butadiene,

00:16:21.326 --> 00:16:27.658
which exists in diesel exhaust
and other combustion situations,

00:16:27.658 --> 00:16:32.678
such as in wood smoke,
or virtually any time fossil

00:16:32.678 --> 00:16:35.288
fuel is being combusted.
 

00:16:35.288 --> 00:16:38.217
And in 1985,
some feedback from their own

00:16:38.217 --> 00:16:42.758
scientific advisory panel raised
questions about the quality of

00:16:42.758 --> 00:16:43.710
the data.
 

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.919
Can you actually calculate a
cancer risk?

00:16:46.919 --> 00:16:49.678
So what is the threat?
 

00:16:49.678 --> 00:16:52.350
And what can publicly be stated
about that threat?

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:54.168
Well, the Natural Resources
Defense Council,

00:16:54.168 --> 00:16:56.370
one of our largest
environmental groups,

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.558
conducted their own analysis of
kids' exposure,

00:16:59.558 --> 00:17:02.585
recognizing that kids were
eating a lot of apples and

00:17:02.585 --> 00:17:05.318
applesauce and drinking a lot of
apple juice.

00:17:05.318 --> 00:17:10.930
It was a very common drink to
be served to infants in place of

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.230
infant formula or milk.
 

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:16.400
And has the EPA violated the
public trust?

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.980
So let me see if I can get this
going.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:25.173
This is a 60 Minutes
report that was prepared on

00:17:25.173 --> 00:17:26.650
this controversy.
 

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.734
So that the Natural Resources
Defense Council brought their

00:17:29.734 --> 00:17:32.130
study to 60 Minutes and
asked them,

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:35.268
"Would you like to release
this information on your

00:17:35.268 --> 00:17:36.009
show?"
 

00:17:36.009 --> 00:17:47.940
And the answer was yes.
 

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.848
Ed Bradley [on video]:
 &gt;

00:17:50.848 --> 00:17:53.880
--in our food supply was a
substance sprayed on apples to

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.019
keep them on the trees longer
and make them look better.

00:17:57.019 --> 00:18:00.450
That's the conclusion of a
number of scientific experts.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.650
And who is most at risk?
 

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:06.179
Children, who may someday
develop cancer from this one

00:18:06.179 --> 00:18:08.108
chemical called daminozide.
 

00:18:08.108 --> 00:18:11.640
Daminozide, which has been
sprayed on apples for more than

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.931
twenty years,
breaks down into another

00:18:13.931 --> 00:18:15.480
chemical called UDMH.
 

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.896
The EPA's acting administrator,
Dr. Jack Moore,

00:18:18.896 --> 00:18:23.354
acknowledged that the EPA has
known about the cancer risk for

00:18:23.354 --> 00:18:24.838
sixteen years.
 

00:18:24.838 --> 00:18:27.363
Jack Moore [on video]:
There's no question if it

00:18:27.363 --> 00:18:30.213
was a new chemical not yet on
the market and it was brought to

00:18:30.213 --> 00:18:32.644
the EPA to be evaluated,
that it would not get on the

00:18:32.644 --> 00:18:34.170
market,
based on the data that was

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:34.670
available.
 

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:35.970
Ed Bradley [on video]:
 Dr. Moore,

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:36.880
I can't understand that.
 

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.288
I mean, you're telling me
something that if this stuff

00:18:39.288 --> 00:18:41.334
came into you just today and it
was brand new,

00:18:41.334 --> 00:18:42.880
it wouldn't get on the market.
 

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.410
But because it's already out
there, we can keep using it?

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:47.568
That doesn't make sense to me.
 

00:18:47.568 --> 00:18:49.330
Jack Moore [on video]:
You've just identified one

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:50.420
of the paradoxes of the statute.
 

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.210
What if a pesticide gets its
license,

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:56.259
gets its registration,
is on the market,

00:18:56.259 --> 00:18:58.568
despite what everybody might
think,

00:18:58.568 --> 00:19:01.652
the burden of carrying
unreasonable risk finding

00:19:01.652 --> 00:19:03.881
basically goes onto the
government.

00:19:03.881 --> 00:19:04.798
All right?
 

00:19:04.798 --> 00:19:05.980
Ed Bradley [on video]:
 But you see,

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.539
a lot of these chemicals got on
the market when we didn't know

00:19:08.539 --> 00:19:10.220
that they were cancer-causing
agents,

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.630
and they're on the market now.
 

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.190
And we know that they do cause
cancer.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.580
But you say we can't take them
off because they're already on

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:18.051
the market and they went on the
market when we didn't know they

00:19:18.051 --> 00:19:18.769
caused cancer.
 

00:19:18.769 --> 00:19:22.095
Jack Moore [on video]:
That's the paradox of

00:19:22.095 --> 00:19:22.759
statute.
 

00:19:22.759 --> 00:19:26.368
Ed Bradley [on video]:
 &gt;

00:19:26.368 --> 00:19:28.288
Is it fair to say then,
Dr. Moore,

00:19:28.288 --> 00:19:31.314
that there are laws on the
books that are putting us,

00:19:31.314 --> 00:19:33.700
particularly our children,
at risk?

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.750
Jack Moore [on video]:
Could be.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.730
Could be.
 

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:39.130
Ed Bradley [on video]:
While Dr. Moore blames a

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.666
law which requires him to
balance the health risks to the

00:19:41.666 --> 00:19:44.338
public against the economic
benefits to the growers,

00:19:44.338 --> 00:19:47.338
Congressman Jerry Sikorsky
blames the EPA.

00:19:47.338 --> 00:19:48.858
Jerry Sikorsky [on video]:
There are two laws.

00:19:48.858 --> 00:19:52.583
One is the Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act that says

00:19:52.583 --> 00:19:57.019
quite clearly if this chemical
causes tumor in laboratory

00:19:57.019 --> 00:19:59.815
animals,
not malignant tumors,

00:19:59.815 --> 00:20:02.657
any kind of tumors,
it's supposed to be pulled off

00:20:02.657 --> 00:20:03.088
the market.
 

00:20:03.088 --> 00:20:04.548
Ed Bradley [on video]:
Jack Moore,

00:20:04.548 --> 00:20:06.259
the deputy administrator of the
EPA,

00:20:06.259 --> 00:20:08.390
says that he'd like to take it
off the market,

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:11.068
but he's afraid that the
manufacturer,

00:20:11.068 --> 00:20:12.680
Uniroyal, that makes this
chemical,

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.269
could successfully sue the EPA.
 

00:20:15.269 --> 00:20:17.170
Jerry Sikorsky [on video]:
So let them sue.

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:18.250
That's his job.
 

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.380
He's with the Environmental
Protection Agency.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.717
Go to a cancer ward at any
children's hospital in this

00:20:24.717 --> 00:20:26.839
country,
see these bald,

00:20:26.839 --> 00:20:31.416
wasting away kids,
and then make a decision as to

00:20:31.416 --> 00:20:35.900
whether the risks balance over
the benefits.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.305
Ed Bradley [on video]:
 Kids are at a high risk

00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:40.618
from UDMH because they drink so
much apple juice.

00:20:40.618 --> 00:20:44.365
The average preschooler drinks
eighteen times more apple juice

00:20:44.365 --> 00:20:45.900
than his or her mother.
 

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.316
If those apples were treated
with daminozide,

00:20:49.316 --> 00:20:52.190
the cancer risk is perilously
high.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:55.121
Janet Hathaway is the senior
attorney for the Natural

00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:56.700
Resources Defense Council.
 

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.988
Janet Hathaway [on video]:
 What we're talking about

00:20:59.988 --> 00:21:03.446
is a cancer-causing agent used
on food that EPA knows is going

00:21:03.446 --> 00:21:07.190
to cause cancer for thousands of
children over their lifetime.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:09.397
Ed Bradley [on video]:
 Uniroyal Chemical,

00:21:09.397 --> 00:21:11.606
which makes daminozide under
the trade name Alar,

00:21:11.606 --> 00:21:13.769
declined to be interviewed for
this report.

00:21:13.769 --> 00:21:16.836
But in a letter,
they said, "Any risk from

00:21:16.836 --> 00:21:18.970
daminozide or UDMH,
if it exists,

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:20.568
is negligible."
 

00:21:20.568 --> 00:21:22.915
Nonetheless,
preliminary results from

00:21:22.915 --> 00:21:26.631
Uniroyal's own study already
show high levels of cancer in

00:21:26.631 --> 00:21:28.130
laboratory animals.
 

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:31.316
Janet Hathaway's organization,
the Natural Resources Defense

00:21:31.316 --> 00:21:33.566
Council,
has just completed the most

00:21:33.566 --> 00:21:37.247
careful study yet on the effect
of daminozide and seven other

00:21:37.247 --> 00:21:40.558
cancer causing pesticides in the
food children eat.

00:21:40.558 --> 00:21:43.806
Janet Hathaway [on video]:
 Just from these eight

00:21:43.806 --> 00:21:47.288
pesticides what we're finding is
that the risk of developing

00:21:47.288 --> 00:21:50.356
cancer is approximately 250
times what EPA says is an

00:21:50.356 --> 00:21:53.250
acceptable level of cancer in a
population.

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:54.805
Ed Bradley [on video]:
 Two hundred and fifty

00:21:54.805 --> 00:21:55.048
times?
 

00:21:55.048 --> 00:21:56.390
Janet Hathaway [on video]:
 That's right.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:22:00.784
What that means is that over a
lifetime, one child out of every

00:22:00.784 --> 00:22:05.036
4,000 or so of our preschoolers
will develop cancer just from

00:22:05.036 --> 00:22:06.950
these eight pesticides.
 

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:09.888
Ed Bradley [on video]:
 And EPA says acceptable

00:22:09.888 --> 00:22:11.108
limit is one out of?
 

00:22:11.108 --> 00:22:13.513
Janet Hathaway [on video]:
 One out of a million they

00:22:13.513 --> 00:22:14.328
say is acceptable.
 

00:22:14.328 --> 00:22:16.160
Ed Bradley [on video]:
 Are they scaring people

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:16.609
needlessly?
 

00:22:16.609 --> 00:22:18.088
Are they fear mongers?
 

00:22:18.088 --> 00:22:20.404
Jack Moore [on video]:
 Well, there's no question

00:22:20.404 --> 00:22:22.594
that if the risk is greater than
the one in a million

00:22:22.594 --> 00:22:25.507
calculation,
it's a cause for concern to

00:22:25.507 --> 00:22:26.240
disease.
 

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.656
Ed Bradley [on video]:
 You've had a chance to

00:22:28.656 --> 00:22:29.818
look at the NRDC study.
 

00:22:29.818 --> 00:22:33.880
It says children are being
bombarded with a pesticide risk

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.941
several hundred times greater
than what the agency says is

00:22:37.941 --> 00:22:39.009
acceptable.
 

00:22:39.009 --> 00:22:41.077
Jack Moore [on video]:
 Risk unacceptable,

00:22:41.077 --> 00:22:43.319
yet magnitude of risk is less
by our calculation than

00:22:43.319 --> 00:22:44.568
&gt;
 

00:22:44.568 --> 00:22:53.655
Ed Bradley [on video]:
 Dr. John Grave a

00:22:53.655 --> 00:22:58.890
professor of--
Prof: I'm sorry,

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:00.950
this will take just one second.
 

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:13.125
**
So think about what Janet

00:23:13.125 --> 00:23:15.890
Hathaway, the senior attorney
just said.

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:18.782
"Over a lifetime,
one child out of every 4,000 or

00:23:18.782 --> 00:23:21.894
so of our preschoolers will
develop cancer from just these

00:23:21.894 --> 00:23:23.368
eight pesticides."
 

00:23:23.368 --> 00:23:25.990
Think about the wording,
the phrasing very carefully.

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:27.778
This is quantitative risk
assessment.

00:23:27.778 --> 00:23:30.548
It's loaded with uncertainty
from many different sources.

00:23:30.548 --> 00:23:34.098
You're forced to infer from
animal evidence.

00:23:34.098 --> 00:23:38.141
You're forced to understand the
pattern of exposure,

00:23:38.141 --> 00:23:42.420
how the compound might behave
inside the human body.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.943
Then she said, "Alar,
the most potent cancer causing

00:23:44.943 --> 00:23:47.442
agent in our food supply,
is a substance sprayed on

00:23:47.442 --> 00:23:50.349
apples to keep them on the trees
longer...And what we're talking

00:23:50.349 --> 00:23:53.163
about is a cancer-causing agent
used on food that EPA knows is

00:23:53.163 --> 00:23:55.794
going to cause cancer for
thousands of children over their

00:23:55.794 --> 00:23:56.808
lifetime."
 

00:23:56.808 --> 00:24:02.405
These are statements of
certainty that caused widespread

00:24:02.405 --> 00:24:04.950
fear in the population.
 

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:09.480
Senator Joe Lieberman spoke to
me during this situation.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.741
And he said he walked
immediately, after watching

00:24:11.741 --> 00:24:13.910
60 Minutes,
over to his refrigerator.

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.233
He took out his jar of apple
juice and dumped it down the

00:24:17.233 --> 00:24:19.548
drain and started making phone
calls.

00:24:19.548 --> 00:24:22.401
This happened all over the
country as millions of people

00:24:22.401 --> 00:24:23.490
had witnessed this.
 

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:28.210
Jack Moore, who you saw,
the acting EPA administrator,

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:32.059
said that the evidence,
yes, that he relied upon was

00:24:32.059 --> 00:24:35.987
suitable for a decision to say
that Alar indeed was a

00:24:35.987 --> 00:24:37.118
carcinogen.
 

00:24:37.118 --> 00:24:39.798
And the media reaction was
really quite striking.

00:24:39.798 --> 00:24:43.236
All of the major media outlets
picked this story up,

00:24:43.236 --> 00:24:45.190
Newsweek,
et cetera.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.875
Donahue, on The Donahue
Show, he said "Don't

00:24:47.875 --> 00:24:50.170
look now, but we're poisoning
our kids."

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:53.874
The consumer reaction was
really quite rapid and

00:24:53.874 --> 00:24:56.788
devastating for the apple
industry.

00:24:56.788 --> 00:24:59.682
Apple product sales dropped
thirty percent in a month,

00:24:59.682 --> 00:25:01.318
particularly on apple juice.
 

00:25:01.318 --> 00:25:04.403
School boards in New York and
Virginia and California stopped

00:25:04.403 --> 00:25:06.509
serving apples in their lunch
programs.

00:25:06.509 --> 00:25:11.380
Growers claimed losses of $250
million and they engaged in a

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:15.673
lawsuit against both 60
Minutes as well as the

00:25:15.673 --> 00:25:18.808
Natural Resources Defense
Council.

00:25:18.808 --> 00:25:23.000
Within a matter of six months,
the economic concerns were so

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.836
high that the industry itself
was begging EPA to please

00:25:26.836 --> 00:25:30.460
regulate and prohibit the use of
this chemical.

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:32.558
Now, that's really quite
striking.

00:25:32.558 --> 00:25:36.132
So that you've got really kind
of a very different type of

00:25:36.132 --> 00:25:37.700
regulatory theory here.
 

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.858
What is regulation doing?
 

00:25:39.858 --> 00:25:43.752
It's really providing a sense
of legitimacy to manufacturers

00:25:43.752 --> 00:25:47.448
of different kinds of products
so that if you know that a

00:25:47.448 --> 00:25:50.515
chemical or a product,
it could be a food,

00:25:50.515 --> 00:25:51.798
it could be a car.
 

00:25:51.798 --> 00:25:55.880
If you know that it's been
reviewed by a regulatory agency,

00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.016
that act of regulation really
constitutes certification of

00:26:00.016 --> 00:26:04.660
that product's utility and also
its safety in the marketplace.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:08.442
So the fact that the growers
and the grocery stores and even

00:26:08.442 --> 00:26:11.905
Uniroyal asked EPA to move
quickly so that the economic

00:26:11.905 --> 00:26:15.432
damage would be limited and
consumer confidence could be

00:26:15.432 --> 00:26:17.883
restored,
particularly because this

00:26:17.883 --> 00:26:20.390
product was not used on all
apple products.

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:22.494
So it really is a form of
symbolic politics,

00:26:22.494 --> 00:26:24.160
which I think is quite
striking.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:28.551
So that regardless of whether
or not the regulations are

00:26:28.551 --> 00:26:31.856
health protective,
they create a sense of

00:26:31.856 --> 00:26:36.000
legitimacy of products and
services in the marketplace so

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.468
that in one sense,
our corporations need these

00:26:40.468 --> 00:26:46.038
regulations so that they create
consumer confidence.

00:26:46.038 --> 00:26:49.202
So the Washington apple
growers, there are 4,700 of

00:26:49.202 --> 00:26:50.551
them,
claimed that well,

00:26:50.551 --> 00:26:53.218
there was no evidence linking
Alar to human cancer and the

00:26:53.218 --> 00:26:54.950
animal evidence was
insufficient,

00:26:54.950 --> 00:27:00.036
and they called this a product
disparagement or a trade libel

00:27:00.036 --> 00:27:00.630
case.
 

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.974
And in this situation,
the growers faced the burden of

00:27:03.974 --> 00:27:04.480
proof.
 

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.422
So they needed to prove that
the statements were made

00:27:08.422 --> 00:27:11.529
knowingly to be false,
the statements were

00:27:11.529 --> 00:27:15.170
deliberately made to induce
monetary damage.

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:20.068
And this is a form of trade
libel law, defamation.

00:27:20.068 --> 00:27:24.319
So there are several forms of
libel, slander,

00:27:24.319 --> 00:27:25.769
and sedition.
 

00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:28.472
Libel, the definition is
defamation through print

00:27:28.472 --> 00:27:29.150
materials.
 

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.390
Slander is oral defamation.
 

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:34.924
In the English common law
tradition, libel in private

00:27:34.924 --> 00:27:38.529
enterprise generally found
favorably to plaintiffs.

00:27:38.529 --> 00:27:40.367
And sedition,
you'll recall,

00:27:40.367 --> 00:27:44.521
is any political criticism that
tended to diminish respect for

00:27:44.521 --> 00:27:47.450
government, laws,
and public officials.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:52.718
The common law definition of
libel was decided by a famous

00:27:52.718 --> 00:27:54.660
court case in 1933.
 

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.182
It covers "all written
communications that tend to

00:27:57.182 --> 00:28:00.170
expose one to public hatred,
shame, obloquy,

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:03.150
contumely, odium,
contempt,

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:06.519
ridicule, aversion,
ostracism, degradation,

00:28:06.519 --> 00:28:09.058
or disgrace,
and to induce an evil opinion

00:28:09.058 --> 00:28:12.218
of one in the minds of
right-thinking persons and to

00:28:12.218 --> 00:28:15.810
deprive one of their confidence
and friendly intercourse in

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:17.048
society."
 

00:28:17.048 --> 00:28:19.855
Well in this case,
the Ninth Circuit Court of

00:28:19.855 --> 00:28:23.617
Appeals found on the absence of
human studies that "The

00:28:23.617 --> 00:28:27.251
fact that there had been no
studies conducted specifically

00:28:27.251 --> 00:28:30.759
on the cancer risks to children
form daminozide,

00:28:30.759 --> 00:28:32.940
one of the arguments on the
part of the industry,

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.497
does nothing to disprove the
conclusion that if children

00:28:35.497 --> 00:28:38.240
consume more of a carcinogenic
substance than do adults,

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.940
they are at higher risk for
contracting cancer."

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.884
So what's interesting about
this comment by the appellate

00:28:43.884 --> 00:28:46.618
court is that they're not
looking for proof that this

00:28:46.618 --> 00:28:48.670
chemical caused cancer in
children.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:53.618
They're looking for elevated
cancer risk.

00:28:53.618 --> 00:28:56.579
And on the falsity of the
statements, a product

00:28:56.579 --> 00:29:00.700
disparagement plaintiff has the
burden of proving the falsity.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.265
And this statement refers to
individuals, not to any overall

00:29:04.265 --> 00:29:04.868
message.
 

00:29:04.868 --> 00:29:07.458
And if a jury were given the
task of interpreting the

00:29:07.458 --> 00:29:09.996
uncertainty of a message,
it raises the specter of a

00:29:09.996 --> 00:29:11.490
chilling effect on speech.
 

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:16.194
So think about the relationship
between this type of a court

00:29:16.194 --> 00:29:20.901
case and the freedom of the
individual to express themselves

00:29:20.901 --> 00:29:25.208
or express their opinion about
the dangers of different

00:29:25.208 --> 00:29:27.920
products or human behaviors.
 

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:32.115
So this case was decided by the
Ninth Circuit fundamentally on a

00:29:32.115 --> 00:29:36.113
First Amendment choice referring
back to a famous New York

00:29:36.113 --> 00:29:38.844
Times v. Sullivan
case in 1964,

00:29:38.844 --> 00:29:41.855
where Sullivan,
who was a police commissioner

00:29:41.855 --> 00:29:44.679
in Alabama brought a libel
action against four African

00:29:44.679 --> 00:29:47.288
American clergy and the New
York Times.

00:29:47.288 --> 00:29:52.304
The Times had published
an advertisement back in 1960 in

00:29:52.304 --> 00:29:56.430
support of civil rights activism
among students,

00:29:56.430 --> 00:30:00.406
a struggle for the right to
vote, a legal defense of Martin

00:30:00.406 --> 00:30:03.150
Luther King against a perjury
charge,

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:05.930
and charges of repressive
police misconduct,

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:07.548
including false statements.
 

00:30:07.548 --> 00:30:11.057
And the trial judge had
instructed the jury that the

00:30:11.057 --> 00:30:15.253
advertisement was libelous,
that legal injury was implied,

00:30:15.253 --> 00:30:18.028
that falsity and malice are
presumed,

00:30:18.028 --> 00:30:21.160
and that punitive damages
should be awarded.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.353
So that in this case,
the Supreme Court found that it

00:30:24.353 --> 00:30:28.160
was constitutionally deficient
for failure to safeguard freedom

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.967
of speech in the press required
by the First and the Fourteenth

00:30:31.967 --> 00:30:32.950
Amendment.
 

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:35.009
And debate on public issues
should be uninhibited,

00:30:35.009 --> 00:30:37.373
robust, wide open,
and that it may well include

00:30:37.373 --> 00:30:40.135
vehement,
caustic, and sharp attacks on

00:30:40.135 --> 00:30:42.578
government and public officials.
 

00:30:42.578 --> 00:30:47.261
With respect to actual malice,
because in order to find

00:30:47.261 --> 00:30:51.077
disparagement or liability in
this situation,

00:30:51.077 --> 00:30:55.240
there's a need to demonstrate
actual malice.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.355
The constitutional guarantees
require a federal rule that

00:30:58.355 --> 00:31:01.361
prohibits a public official from
recovering damages for

00:31:01.361 --> 00:31:04.810
defamatory falsehood relating to
his official conduct unless he

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:08.150
proves that the statement was
made with actual malice.

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:09.880
What's malice?
 

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.707
Well, it's with knowledge that
the claim was false when it was

00:31:13.707 --> 00:31:17.410
made, or with reckless disregard
of whether it was false.

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:22.071
And the burden of demonstrating
the falsity rests on the

00:31:22.071 --> 00:31:23.088
plaintiff.
 

00:31:23.088 --> 00:31:28.896
Now, this seems to give the
media a fairly wide berth in the

00:31:28.896 --> 00:31:32.538
kinds of claims that they can
make.

00:31:32.538 --> 00:31:37.067
In the wake of this case,
many states passed what are

00:31:37.067 --> 00:31:41.420
thought of now and labeled as
veggie libel laws.

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:46.458
So that rather than placing the
burden on a plaintiff to

00:31:46.458 --> 00:31:50.490
demonstrate the falsity of the
statement,

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:54.087
they place the burden on the
individual that makes the claim

00:31:54.087 --> 00:31:56.038
of significant risk or hazard.
 

00:31:56.038 --> 00:32:00.640
So there are many states that
have adopted this statutory

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.380
change.
 

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:06.099
And what this means is that it
opens the way for slap suits.

00:32:06.099 --> 00:32:07.710
What is a slap suit?
 

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:12.076
It basically is a suit that
intimidates people from making

00:32:12.076 --> 00:32:16.597
claims about the quality of the
environment or causes of its

00:32:16.597 --> 00:32:19.509
loss or subsequent health
damages.

00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:23.190
So among these twenty or so
states that have adopted these

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:26.226
laws, for example,
now I will not give a lecture

00:32:26.226 --> 00:32:28.680
where I am making a claim of
risk.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.982
So that might be thought of as
a chilling effect on free speech

00:32:31.982 --> 00:32:32.568
in a way.
 

00:32:32.568 --> 00:32:36.269
So if I'm, say,
being taped on a radio show,

00:32:36.269 --> 00:32:41.097
that radio show is broadcast in
a state where one of these

00:32:41.097 --> 00:32:46.182
veggie libel laws exists that
would place the burden on me to

00:32:46.182 --> 00:32:50.840
demonstrate the proof that my
claim is backed up by high

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.597
quality science,
that will pull me into court,

00:32:54.597 --> 00:32:57.029
it will cost me thousands of
dollars,

00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:58.759
hundreds of thousands of
dollars even,

00:32:58.759 --> 00:33:02.490
to defend myself.
 

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:07.153
So that the influence of this
form of law is really quite

00:33:07.153 --> 00:33:08.068
striking.
 

00:33:08.068 --> 00:33:12.144
What also is interesting about
this evolution of state laws

00:33:12.144 --> 00:33:16.570
that reverse the burden of proof
is that clearly it's been found

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:20.855
by the Supreme Court as being an
unconstitutional shift in the

00:33:20.855 --> 00:33:21.769
burden.
 

00:33:21.769 --> 00:33:25.241
Yet none of these state laws
have been taken up to the

00:33:25.241 --> 00:33:27.470
Supreme Court for consideration.
 

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:29.528
So think about that.
 

00:33:29.528 --> 00:33:32.608
These laws have been in place
now for well over a decade,

00:33:32.608 --> 00:33:36.441
and all environmental groups,
all public health interest

00:33:36.441 --> 00:33:40.760
groups understand the nature of
these laws and they're all very

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:45.289
self-conscious about the nature
of the claims that they make.

00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:47.269
Now, I want to show you this.
 

00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:52.440
Oprah Winfrey hosted a show on
mad cow disease.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:57.686
Mad cow disease is an illness
that is caused by a prion and

00:33:57.686 --> 00:34:03.204
believed to be associated with
beef that are feed other cattle

00:34:03.204 --> 00:34:06.009
parts in their cattle meal.
 

00:34:06.009 --> 00:34:10.958
So Winfrey hosted Howard Lyman,
who described the process of

00:34:10.958 --> 00:34:15.655
slaughterhouses and beef
rendering and how the parts were

00:34:15.655 --> 00:34:20.519
ground up and then put into
animal feed and fed back in the

00:34:20.519 --> 00:34:25.050
United States to cattle that
were sold for food.

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:29.628
And this was the mechanism that
he and others believed had

00:34:29.628 --> 00:34:34.289
caused the outbreak of mad cow
disease in Great Britain.

00:34:34.289 --> 00:34:37.030
Now there are laws that prevent
that from happening,

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:41.206
but at this point in time,
this represents another rather

00:34:41.206 --> 00:34:44.489
interesting case on product
disparagement.

00:34:44.489 --> 00:35:02.539
** Give me one second
here.

00:35:02.539 --> 00:35:16.851
** I've lost my
internet connection,

00:35:16.851 --> 00:35:27.260
so we're on hold for a moment.
 

00:35:27.260 --> 00:36:15.880
** My apology for that
delay.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.199
Howard Lyman [on video]:
 With me on the stage,

00:36:18.199 --> 00:36:21.418
to the left of me a grandmother
whose granddaughter is dying of

00:36:21.418 --> 00:36:23.860
the human form of mad cow
disease in England.

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.887
To the right of me,
a guy from the National Cattle

00:36:26.887 --> 00:36:29.563
and Beef Association,
points at me and says

00:36:29.563 --> 00:36:33.092
"Here is a man who believes
within ten years we could have

00:36:33.092 --> 00:36:36.449
diseases that make AIDS look
like the common cold."

00:36:36.449 --> 00:36:38.949
And I said, absolutely.
 

00:36:38.949 --> 00:36:40.215
And she said,
"That's such a strong

00:36:40.215 --> 00:36:40.800
statement."
 

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.117
I said, "Oprah,
we have 100,000 cows a year

00:36:44.117 --> 00:36:46.800
alive at night,
dead in the morning.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.920
We round them up,
grind them up,

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:52.480
turn them into feed,
feed them back to other cows.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.911
We go out and collect road
kill, deer, elk,

00:36:54.911 --> 00:36:57.342
possum, raccoons,
scrape them up off of the

00:36:57.342 --> 00:37:00.469
street, grind them up,
and feed them back to cows.

00:37:00.469 --> 00:37:03.340
And then we take pets,
city of Los Angeles,

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:06.994
200 tons of pets,
full of chemicals that were

00:37:06.994 --> 00:37:10.717
used to kill them,
200 tons a month are ground up,

00:37:10.717 --> 00:37:13.733
turned into feed,
and fed back to our food

00:37:13.733 --> 00:37:14.860
animals."
 

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:18.030
This time Oprah's eyes are as
big as saucers.

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:21.309
I knew that I'd got her.
 

00:37:21.309 --> 00:37:25.322
She turns around and looks at
the guy from the National Cattle

00:37:25.322 --> 00:37:28.347
and Beef Association and says,
"Dr. Weber,

00:37:28.347 --> 00:37:30.980
are we feeding cows to
cows?"

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:34.090
I'll never **
what he had to say,

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:37.014
he said, "Well,
you know, there's a limited

00:37:37.014 --> 00:37:39.130
amount of that going on."
 

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:42.250
I believe that about
ninety-five percent of the

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:46.387
cattle fed back in factory feed
lots are eating the remains of

00:37:46.387 --> 00:37:47.610
other animals.
 

00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:52.420
And the next thing out of
Oprah's mouth then gets us sued.

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:55.909
Oprah says, "That just
stops me cold.

00:37:55.909 --> 00:37:59.340
I will never again eat a
burger."

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:04.150
Now, she didn't say,
"I think the meat's

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:06.010
infected."
 

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:09.161
She didn't say to the millions
of viewers, "You shouldn't

00:38:09.161 --> 00:38:09.989
eat any."
 

00:38:09.989 --> 00:38:12.760
She just said,
"That stops me cold.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.460
I will never again eat a
burger."

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:19.456
Now I knew when I went on that
show that thirteen states had a

00:38:19.456 --> 00:38:22.210
thing called the food
disparagement law.

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:26.972
The food disparagement law says
that it's against the law to say

00:38:26.972 --> 00:38:31.659
something you know to be false
about a perishable commodity.

00:38:31.659 --> 00:38:35.309
I didn't say anything I thought
to be false.

00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:40.170
I told the truth.
 

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:44.739
Well, we were taping the show,
took about two hours.

00:38:44.739 --> 00:38:47.576
When we got done taping the
show I walked up to Oprah and I

00:38:47.576 --> 00:38:49.974
said to her,
I said, "Hey Oprah,

00:38:49.974 --> 00:38:53.360
give me ten minutes,
I'll get you off of

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.829
chicken."
 

00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:57.257
Oprah looked at me and said,
"Only one animal a

00:38:57.257 --> 00:38:57.829
day."
 

00:38:57.829 --> 00:39:00.329
&lt;&lt;audience
laughter&gt;&gt;

00:39:00.329 --> 00:39:04.380
So, I went about my business.
 

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.650
Couple weeks later,
I got a call that said,

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:09.576
"Do you realize you're
being sued with Oprah Winfrey

00:39:09.576 --> 00:39:12.659
and Harpo Production by a group
of Texas cattlemen?"

00:39:12.659 --> 00:39:15.760
And I said, "No,
can I put you on hold?"

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.038
I raced into my library,
I inventoried my vegetarian

00:39:19.038 --> 00:39:19.809
cookbooks.
 

00:39:19.809 --> 00:39:24.760
I knew those cattlemen wanted
those vegetarian cookbooks bad.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.327
I went back and said,
"I can't talk to you right

00:39:27.327 --> 00:39:29.699
now, I've got to put in a call
to Oprah."

00:39:29.699 --> 00:39:32.909
I called Oprah and left a
message, and I said,

00:39:32.909 --> 00:39:35.262
"Oprah,
if we lose this suit,

00:39:35.262 --> 00:39:38.829
I'm going to throw in my
vegetarian cookbooks.

00:39:38.829 --> 00:39:41.610
You've got to put up the
money."

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:46.500
Well, we end up getting sued in
Amarillo, Texas.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:50.288
I don't know how many of you
have ever been to Amarillo,

00:39:50.288 --> 00:39:50.840
Texas.
 

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:55.956
It's not the end of the world,
but it's clearly visible from

00:39:55.956 --> 00:39:56.650
there.
 

00:39:56.650 --> 00:40:01.141
If you're going to give the
world an enema you take the hose

00:40:01.141 --> 00:40:02.739
to Amarillo, Texas.
 

00:40:02.739 --> 00:40:06.181
The largest employer in
Amarillo, Texas,

00:40:06.181 --> 00:40:10.949
happens to be the slaughter
facility killing cattle.

00:40:10.949 --> 00:40:15.755
Bumper stickers all over town
said, "The only mad cow in

00:40:15.755 --> 00:40:18.079
Texas is named Oprah."
 

00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:21.501
I knew we were in trouble when
I went and saw my lawyer,

00:40:21.501 --> 00:40:24.177
and I said to him,
"We need a change of

00:40:24.177 --> 00:40:24.800
venue.
 

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.893
There is no way in the world
that we can win here in

00:40:28.893 --> 00:40:30.260
Amarillo."
 

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:34.849
So we filed with the judge for
a change of venue.

00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:38.039
We walked in, who's the judge?
 

00:40:38.039 --> 00:40:42.480
Seventy-two-year-old lady,
a tough old heifer.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.623
We asked for a change of venue,
she picks up the hammer,

00:40:45.623 --> 00:40:48.309
slaps it down,
and says, "Motion denied.

00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:50.510
Bring in the jury pool."
 

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:52.420
They brought 140 people in.
 

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:55.782
You never saw so many hats,
boots, and belt buckles in all

00:40:55.782 --> 00:40:56.489
your life.
 

00:40:56.489 --> 00:40:58.954
I said to my lawyer,
"We need to find an

00:40:58.954 --> 00:41:02.425
appeal, because there's no way
in the world that we're going to

00:41:02.425 --> 00:41:03.489
win here."
 

00:41:03.489 --> 00:41:06.980
At the end of the day,
we had twelve jurors,

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:10.469
absolutely steeped in the
cattle culture.

00:41:10.469 --> 00:41:16.275
My lawyer, he looks at me and
he said, "They're going to

00:41:16.275 --> 00:41:20.050
call you to the stand
tomorrow."

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:23.454
He said, "The first
question they're going to ask

00:41:23.454 --> 00:41:26.730
you is whether or not you are a
vegetarian."

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:28.780
I said, "I can handle
that."

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:33.179
He said, "You damn well
better, you'll lose."

00:41:33.179 --> 00:41:35.202
Sure enough,
the next day they called me to

00:41:35.202 --> 00:41:35.780
the stand.
 

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:38.630
I'm on the stand with the
plaintiff's attorney is looking

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:40.210
at me, laughing and giggling.
 

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:43.679
And he says,
"I can't hardly say this.

00:41:43.679 --> 00:41:47.255
Hey, Mr. Lyman,
is it true that you are a--

00:41:47.255 --> 00:41:49.469
&gt;
 

00:41:49.469 --> 00:41:51.400
--a vegetarian?"
 

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:55.148
And I looked at the jury and
said, "I will not apologize

00:41:55.148 --> 00:41:57.960
for something that has saved my
life."

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:03.585
Never again in that trial did
they ever ask me about why I was

00:42:03.585 --> 00:42:04.969
a vegetarian.
 

00:42:04.969 --> 00:42:08.619
But they asked me every
question you can imagine.

00:42:08.619 --> 00:42:11.550
I'm on the stand,
the lawyer looks at me and he

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:14.672
says, "Mr. Lyman,
has anybody ever called you

00:42:14.672 --> 00:42:16.329
irresponsible?"
 

00:42:16.329 --> 00:42:18.170
I said, "Yes."
 

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:22.257
My lawyer's sitting over there
going, "No,

00:42:22.257 --> 00:42:23.590
no, no."
 

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:26.641
The plaintiff's attorney thinks
he's found the key to the

00:42:26.641 --> 00:42:27.460
Gordian Knot.
 

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:29.900
And he looks at me and he says,
"Who?"

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.119
I said, "My wife."
 

00:42:32.119 --> 00:42:36.929
And the jury's over there,
been there, done that.

00:42:36.929 --> 00:42:40.000
We were in that courtroom for
six weeks.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.577
At the end of six weeks,
that jury found Oprah,

00:42:44.577 --> 00:42:48.659
Harpo Production and myself not
liable.

00:42:48.659 --> 00:42:51.219
The plaintiffs went out of
their tree.

00:42:51.219 --> 00:42:56.900
They could not imagine that
that jury, that homegrown jury,

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:00.719
could find out-of-towners not
liable.

00:43:00.719 --> 00:43:05.360
And they appealed with the
Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:08.489
We spent a year in the Fifth
Circuit Court of Appeals.

00:43:08.489 --> 00:43:12.487
And at the end of the year,
they came down with a unanimous

00:43:12.487 --> 00:43:16.141
panel decision that Oprah,
Harpo Production and myself

00:43:16.141 --> 00:43:17.518
were not liable.
 

00:43:17.518 --> 00:43:21.630
And then they wrote an opinion
that said,

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:26.431
"Everything that Lyman
said on the show was true and

00:43:26.431 --> 00:43:29.518
the truth is not
actionable."

00:43:29.518 --> 00:43:32.076
The cattlemen couldn't stand
that and asked

00:43:32.076 --> 00:43:33.719
&gt;
 

00:43:33.719 --> 00:43:35.599
for a rehearing.
 

00:43:35.599 --> 00:43:37.449
It was denied.
 

00:43:37.449 --> 00:43:41.447
And then the cattlemen got
together and went to state court

00:43:41.447 --> 00:43:45.306
and filed suit against Oprah,
Harpo Production and myself

00:43:45.306 --> 00:43:47.030
with the state court.
 

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:49.309
Thank God I did not live in
Texas.

00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:52.844
I was able to move it from the
state court to the federal

00:43:52.844 --> 00:43:53.349
court.
 

00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:54.449
They appealed that.
 

00:43:54.449 --> 00:43:57.771
We spent six years,
hundreds of thousands of

00:43:57.771 --> 00:44:02.329
dollars of my money defending
&gt;

00:44:02.329 --> 00:44:05.150
to tell the truth.
 

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:09.769
At the end of six years the
judge finally threw out the case

00:44:09.769 --> 00:44:12.760
with prejudice,
which meant the jury,

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:16.300
or the plaintiffs could not
re-file the case,

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:22.360
that the statute of limitations
had run out.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:30.976
So it became six years,
hundreds of thousands of

00:44:30.976 --> 00:44:40.876
dollars, we were finally
vindicated for standing up and

00:44:40.876 --> 00:44:44.909
telling the truth.
 

00:44:44.909 --> 00:44:47.844
Prof: So the core of
this problem is the way that

00:44:47.844 --> 00:44:50.940
these state veggie libel laws
shift the burden of proof.

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:54.436
So under federal law,
it's really clear that the

00:44:54.436 --> 00:44:58.527
Cattlemen's Association was
under the burden of proof to

00:44:58.527 --> 00:45:02.471
demonstrate that the statement
was knowingly false and

00:45:02.471 --> 00:45:06.340
delivered with malice with the
intent to harm.

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:09.893
But under state law,
Oprah's burden was to

00:45:09.893 --> 00:45:14.485
demonstrate that the statement
is true with reasonable

00:45:14.485 --> 00:45:15.699
certainty.
 

00:45:15.699 --> 00:45:18.900
So I'll leave you with one
thought on this,

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:22.358
and the importance of
fashioning law in a way that

00:45:22.358 --> 00:45:26.666
would protect free speech and
open access to knowledge of risk

00:45:26.666 --> 00:45:29.489
and opinions on the part of
experts.

00:45:29.489 --> 00:45:32.257
Justice Powell,
in 1974 on truth and free

00:45:32.257 --> 00:45:34.076
speech,
"There's no such thing as

00:45:34.076 --> 00:45:36.248
a false idea,
no matter how pernicious an

00:45:36.248 --> 00:45:39.635
opinion may seem,
we depend its correction not on

00:45:39.635 --> 00:45:42.400
the conscience of judges and
juries,

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:45.519
but on the competition of other
ideas."

00:45:45.519 --> 00:45:46.599
So that's it for today.
 

00:45:46.599 --> 00:45:47.639
Have a great weekend.
 

00:45:47.639 --> 00:45:53.000

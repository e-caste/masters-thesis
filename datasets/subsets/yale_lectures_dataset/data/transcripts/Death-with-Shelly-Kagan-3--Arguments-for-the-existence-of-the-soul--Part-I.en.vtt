00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.846
Professor Shelly Kagan:
Today we're going to take up the

00:00:02.846 --> 00:00:04.450
discussion where we left it last
time.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.262
We were talking about two main
positions with regard to the

00:00:08.262 --> 00:00:11.183
question, "What is a person?"
On the one hand,

00:00:11.183 --> 00:00:14.738
we have the dualist view;
that's the view that we spent a

00:00:14.738 --> 00:00:17.540
fair bit of time sketching last
meeting.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.745
The dualist view,
according to which a person is

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:23.784
a body and a soul.
Or perhaps, strictly speaking,

00:00:23.784 --> 00:00:27.022
what we should say is the only
part that's essential to the

00:00:27.022 --> 00:00:29.682
person is the soul,
though it's got a rather

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:32.190
intimate connection to a
particular body.

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.498
That's the dualist view.
In contrast to that,

00:00:35.498 --> 00:00:39.270
we've got the physicalist view,
according to which there are

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.193
just bodies.
A person is just a body,

00:00:42.193 --> 00:00:45.294
as we might put it.
Now, the crucial point here,

00:00:45.294 --> 00:00:47.910
the point I was turning to as
we ended last time,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.626
is that although a person on
the physicalist view is just a

00:00:52.626 --> 00:00:55.960
body, a person isn't just any
old body.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.277
A person is a body that has a
certain set of abilities,

00:01:02.277 --> 00:01:06.840
can do a certain array of
activities.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.911
People are bodies that can
think, that can communicate,

00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:13.549
that are rational,
that can plan,

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.235
that can feel things,
that can be creative,

00:01:17.235 --> 00:01:22.034
and so forth and so on.
Now, we might argue about

00:01:22.034 --> 00:01:26.930
what's the exact best list of
those abilities.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.220
For our purposes,
I think that won't be crucial,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.930
and so I'll sometimes talk
about this set of abilities

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.080
without actually having a
canonical list.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.683
Just think of them as the set
of abilities that people have,

00:01:41.683 --> 00:01:46.599
the things that we can do that
other physical objects--chalk,

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:51.330
radios, cars--those things
can't do.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.360
Call those the abilities that
make something a person.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.116
To just introduce a piece of
jargon, we could call those the

00:02:00.116 --> 00:02:02.790
P abilities,
P for person.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.064
Or we could talk about the
various kinds of ways--this is

00:02:05.064 --> 00:02:07.380
the physicalist way of thinking
about it--according to the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.784
physicalist,
a person is just a body that

00:02:10.784 --> 00:02:16.590
has the ability to fulfill the
various P functions.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.291
And we can talk,
then, about a person as a

00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:25.543
P-functioning body.
Or we could say that a person

00:02:25.543 --> 00:02:29.300
is a body that is
P-functioning.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.293
It's important to see that the
idea is, although it's a body,

00:02:32.293 --> 00:02:35.076
it's not just any old body.
Indeed, it's not just any old

00:02:35.076 --> 00:02:37.737
human body.
After all, if you rip out your

00:02:37.737 --> 00:02:40.828
gun, shoot me in the heart,
I bleed to death,

00:02:40.828 --> 00:02:43.990
we still have a human body in
front of us.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.490
But we don't have a
P-functioning body.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.496
We don't have a body that's
able to think,

00:02:50.496 --> 00:02:53.576
a body that's able to plan,
to communicate,

00:02:53.576 --> 00:02:56.069
to be creative,
to have goals.

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.853
So the crucial thing about
having a person is having a

00:03:00.853 --> 00:03:08.110
P-functioning body.
Now, what's a mind on this view?

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.302
On the physicalist view,
it's still perfectly legitimate

00:03:11.302 --> 00:03:13.523
to talk about minds.
The point, though,

00:03:13.523 --> 00:03:16.565
is that from the physicalist
perspective, the best thing to

00:03:16.565 --> 00:03:20.500
say is,
talk about a mind is a way of

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.320
talking about these various
mental abilities of the body.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.550
We nominalize it.
We talk about it using a noun,

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.186
the mind.
But talk of the mind is just a

00:03:36.186 --> 00:03:41.728
way of talking about these
abilities that the body has when

00:03:41.728 --> 00:03:46.338
it's functioning properly.
This is similar,

00:03:46.338 --> 00:03:50.590
let's say, to talking about a
smile.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.389
We believe that there are
smiles.

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.840
Physicalists don't deny that
there are minds.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.796
Just like we don't deny,
we all believe,

00:03:56.796 --> 00:03:59.819
that there are smiles.
But what is a smile?

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.589
Well, a smile is just a way of
talking about the ability of the

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:10.329
body to do something.
This characteristic thing we do

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.270
with our lips exposing our teeth
and so forth.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.583
It's a smile,
a rather dorky smile,

00:04:16.583 --> 00:04:20.088
but there's a smile.
Now, if you were listing the

00:04:20.088 --> 00:04:23.173
parts of the body,
you would list the teeth,

00:04:23.173 --> 00:04:26.844
you would list the lips,
you would list the gums,

00:04:26.844 --> 00:04:30.529
you would list the tongue,
but you wouldn't list the

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:33.106
smile.
So, should we conclude,

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:36.373
as dualists,
that smiles are these extra

00:04:36.373 --> 00:04:41.315
nonphysical things that have a
special intimate relationship

00:04:41.315 --> 00:04:44.190
with bodies?
Well, you could imagine a view

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.509
like that, but it would be
rather a silly view.

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:53.779
Talk about a smile is just a
way of talking about the body's

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:58.660
ability to smile.
There's no extra part.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.735
Even though we have a noun,
the smile, that if you're not

00:05:03.735 --> 00:05:08.991
careful might lull you into
thinking there must be a thing,

00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:11.661
the smile.
And then you'd have all these

00:05:11.661 --> 00:05:14.889
metaphysical conundrums.
Where is the smile located?

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.940
It seems to be in the vicinity
of the mouth.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.810
But the smile isn't the lips.
The smile isn't the teeth.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.620
So it must be something
nonphysical.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.870
No, that would just be a silly
way to think about smiles.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.822
Talk of smiles is just a way of
talking about the ability of the

00:05:33.822 --> 00:05:36.940
body to smile,
to form a smile.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.930
That's an ability that we have,
our bodies have.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.925
Similarly, then,
according to the physicalist,

00:05:43.925 --> 00:05:47.121
talk of the mind,
despite the fact that we have a

00:05:47.121 --> 00:05:51.177
noun there,
is just a way of talking about

00:05:51.177 --> 00:05:56.069
the abilities of the body to do
various things.

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:01.221
The mind is just a way of
talking about the fact that our

00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:04.350
body can think,
can communicate,

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.555
can plan, can deliberate,
can be creative,

00:06:08.555 --> 00:06:12.350
can write poetry,
can fall in love.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.659
Talk of all of those things is
what we mean by the mind,

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:21.124
but there's no extra thing,
the mind, above and beyond the

00:06:21.124 --> 00:06:22.870
body.
That's the physicalist view.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.717
So it's important,
in particular,

00:06:25.717 --> 00:06:30.610
to understand that from the
physicalist's point of view,

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.356
the mind is not the brain.
You might think,

00:06:34.356 --> 00:06:37.450
"Look, according to
physicalists minds are just

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.637
brains."
And that wouldn't be a

00:06:39.637 --> 00:06:43.650
horrendously misleading thing to
say, because according to the

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.342
best science that we've got,
the brain is the part of the

00:06:48.342 --> 00:06:53.838
body that is the seat or house
or the underlying mechanical

00:06:53.838 --> 00:06:58.670
structure that gives us these
various abilities.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.125
These P functions are
functions that we have by virtue

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:05.677
of our brain.
So that might tempt you into

00:07:05.677 --> 00:07:10.286
saying the mind on the
physicalist view is just a

00:07:10.286 --> 00:07:13.271
brain.
But we probably shouldn't say

00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:15.051
that.
After all, if you shoot me,

00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:16.940
there's my corpse lying on the
stage.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.624
Well, there's my brain.
My brain is still there in my

00:07:21.624 --> 00:07:24.720
head.
But we no longer have a person.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.857
The person has died.
The person, it seems,

00:07:27.857 --> 00:07:30.314
no longer exists.
Whether strictly that's the

00:07:30.314 --> 00:07:32.991
best thing to say or not is a
question we'll have to come to

00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:35.957
in a couple of weeks.
But it seems pretty clear that

00:07:35.957 --> 00:07:39.586
the mind has been destroyed,
even though the brain is still

00:07:39.586 --> 00:07:41.381
there.
So I think, at least when

00:07:41.381 --> 00:07:44.041
there's the need to be
careful--maybe we don't normally

00:07:44.041 --> 00:07:46.849
have a need to be careful--but
when there's the need to be

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:48.811
careful,
we should say,

00:07:48.811 --> 00:07:53.060
talk of the mind is a way of
talking about the

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.459
P-functioning of the
body.

00:07:56.459 --> 00:08:01.019
Our best science suggests that
a well-functioning body can

00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:04.755
perform these things,
can think and plan and fall in

00:08:04.755 --> 00:08:08.231
love by virtue of the fact that
the brain is functioning

00:08:08.231 --> 00:08:11.589
properly.
That's the physicalist view.

00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:16.060
On the dualist view,
what was death?

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.492
Death is presumably the
separation of the mind and the

00:08:19.492 --> 00:08:23.313
body, perhaps the permanent
separation, with the destruction

00:08:23.313 --> 00:08:26.193
of the body.
What's death on the physicalist

00:08:26.193 --> 00:08:29.733
view?
Well, there is no extra entity,

00:08:29.733 --> 00:08:32.592
the soul.
The mind is just the proper

00:08:32.592 --> 00:08:34.899
P-functioning of the
body.

00:08:34.899 --> 00:08:40.154
So, the mind gets destroyed
when the ability of the body to

00:08:40.154 --> 00:08:43.960
function in that way has been
destroyed.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.752
Death is, roughly,
the end of this set of

00:08:47.752 --> 00:08:49.080
functioning.

00:08:52.149 --> 00:08:55.800
Again, this probably should be
cleaned up and in a couple of

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.769
weeks we'll spend a day or half
period trying,

00:08:58.769 --> 00:09:00.990
to clean it up and make it
somewhat more precise.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.144
But there's nothing mysterious
about death from the physicalist

00:09:04.144 --> 00:09:06.331
point of view,
at least about the basic idea

00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:11.230
of what's going on in death.
I've got a stereo.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:15.070
Suppose I hold up my boombox
for you and it's playing music.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.649
It's one of the things it can
do.

00:09:16.649 --> 00:09:20.549
And I drop in on the ground,
smashing it.

00:09:20.549 --> 00:09:24.140
Well, it no longer can function
properly.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.748
It's broken.
There's no mystery why it can't

00:09:28.748 --> 00:09:33.391
function once it's broken.
Death is basically just the

00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:37.516
breaking down of the body,
on the physicalist point of

00:09:37.516 --> 00:09:41.330
view, so that it no longer
functions properly.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.894
One other point worth
emphasizing and sketching the

00:09:44.894 --> 00:09:47.678
physicalist view is this.
So, as I said,

00:09:47.678 --> 00:09:50.500
physicalists don't deny that
there are minds.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.634
Even though we say "we're just
bodies," that doesn't mean that

00:09:53.634 --> 00:09:56.371
we're just any old body.
It's not as though the

00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:59.427
physicalist view is,
"we're bodies that have some

00:09:59.427 --> 00:10:03.891
illusion of thinking."
No, we're bodies that really do

00:10:03.891 --> 00:10:07.919
think.
So there really are minds.

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:11.080
We could, on the physicalist
point of view,

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.162
call those souls.
Just like there's no danger in

00:10:14.162 --> 00:10:17.025
talking of the mind from the
physicalist perspective,

00:10:17.025 --> 00:10:20.549
there wouldn't be any serious
danger in talking about a soul.

00:10:20.549 --> 00:10:24.531
And so, in certain contexts,
I'm perfectly comfortable--in

00:10:24.531 --> 00:10:26.977
my physicalist moods,
I am perfectly

00:10:26.977 --> 00:10:30.470
comfortable--talking about this
person's soul.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.642
He's got a good soul,
a bad soul, how the soul soars

00:10:33.642 --> 00:10:36.379
when I read Shakespeare,
or what have you.

00:10:36.379 --> 00:10:40.375
There's nothing upsetting or
improper about the language of

00:10:40.375 --> 00:10:43.820
the soul, even on the
physicalist point of view.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.887
But in this class,
just to try to keep us from

00:10:46.887 --> 00:10:49.886
getting confused,
as I indicated before and I

00:10:49.886 --> 00:10:52.953
want to remind you,
I'm going to save the word

00:10:52.953 --> 00:10:55.251
"soul";
I'm going to at least try to

00:10:55.251 --> 00:10:58.176
save the word "soul" for when
I'm talking about the dualist

00:10:58.176 --> 00:11:00.620
view.
So we might put it this way.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.269
The neutral term is going to be
"mind."

00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:10.140
We all agree that people have
minds, sort of the house or the

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:14.409
seat of our personalities.
The question is,

00:11:14.409 --> 00:11:19.071
"What is a mind?"
The dualist position is that

00:11:19.071 --> 00:11:25.059
the mind is a soul and the soul
is an immaterial object.

00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:29.460
So when I use the word "soul,"
I will try to reserve it for the

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.725
metaphysical view,
according to which souls are

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:35.815
something immaterial.
In contrast to that,

00:11:35.815 --> 00:11:40.296
we've got the physicalist view.
Physicalists also believe in

00:11:40.296 --> 00:11:42.696
minds.
But minds are just a way of

00:11:42.696 --> 00:11:45.440
talking about the abilities of
the body.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.285
So physicalists do not believe
in any immaterial object above

00:11:50.285 --> 00:11:54.000
and beyond the body that's part
of a person.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.672
Just to keep things clear,
I will say that physicalists,

00:11:58.672 --> 00:12:02.070
materialists,
do not believe in souls.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:07.143
Because, for the purposes of
this class, I'm going to reserve

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:11.709
the word "soul" for the
immaterialist conception of the

00:12:11.709 --> 00:12:15.735
mind.
In other contexts--no harm in

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:19.946
talking about souls.
So these are the two basic

00:12:19.946 --> 00:12:23.001
positions: the dualist view on
the one hand,

00:12:23.001 --> 00:12:25.629
the physicalist view on the
other.

00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:29.238
The question we need to turn
to--I take it that just as the

00:12:29.238 --> 00:12:32.473
dualist view is a familiar one,
so it's true that the

00:12:32.473 --> 00:12:34.899
physicalist view is a familiar
one.

00:12:34.899 --> 00:12:37.804
Whether or not you believe it,
you are familiar with the fact

00:12:37.804 --> 00:12:40.612
that some people believe it,
or at least you wonder whether

00:12:40.612 --> 00:12:42.953
it's true.
Does science require that we

00:12:42.953 --> 00:12:45.330
believe in the physicalist view
or not?

00:12:48.679 --> 00:12:51.591
The question we want to turn
to, then, is,

00:12:51.591 --> 00:12:54.645
"Which of these two views
should we believe:

00:12:54.645 --> 00:12:58.480
the dualist position or the
physicalist position?"

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.662
And the crucial question,
presumably, is,

00:13:01.662 --> 00:13:05.560
"Should we believe in the
existence of a soul?"

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:11.046
Both sides believe in bodies.
As I say, the dualist position,

00:13:11.046 --> 00:13:14.073
as we're understanding it,
is not a view that says there

00:13:14.073 --> 00:13:16.220
are only minds,
there are no bodies.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.730
Dualists believe that there are
bodies.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.899
They believe that there are
souls as well as bodies.

00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:23.259
Physicalists believe there are
bodies but no souls.

00:13:23.259 --> 00:13:26.840
So there's an agreement that
there are bodies.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.672
Here is one.
Each one of you is sort of

00:13:29.672 --> 00:13:32.796
dragging one around with you.
There's agreement that there's

00:13:32.796 --> 00:13:34.438
bodies.
The question is,

00:13:34.438 --> 00:13:37.450
"Are there anything beyond
bodies?"

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.330
Is there anything beyond the
body?

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.379
Is there a soul?
Are there souls?

00:13:42.379 --> 00:13:45.775
That's the question that's
going to concern us for a couple

00:13:45.775 --> 00:13:46.420
of weeks.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.621
If we ask ourselves,
"What reasons do we have to

00:13:53.621 --> 00:13:56.793
believe in a soul?"
we might start by asking,

00:13:56.793 --> 00:14:00.200
what reasons do we have to
believe in anything?

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.529
How do we prove the existence
of things?

00:14:02.529 --> 00:14:08.932
For lots of familiar everyday
objects, the answer is fairly

00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:12.491
straightforward.
We prove their existence by

00:14:12.491 --> 00:14:16.539
using our five senses.
We just see them.

00:14:16.539 --> 00:14:20.509
How do I know that there are
chairs?

00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:23.230
Well, there are some chairs in
front of me.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.882
Open my eyes, I see them.
How do I know that there is a

00:14:26.882 --> 00:14:29.160
lectern?
Well, I see it.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.590
I can touch it.
I feel it.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.890
How do I know that there are
trees?

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.559
I see them.
How do I know that there are

00:14:37.559 --> 00:14:38.400
birds?
I see them.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.192
I hear them.
How do I know that there are

00:14:40.192 --> 00:14:41.180
apples?
I see them.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:45.259
I taste them.
So forth and so on.

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:50.648
That approach pretty clearly
isn't going to work for souls,

00:14:50.648 --> 00:14:54.539
because a soul--and again,
we've got in mind this

00:14:54.539 --> 00:14:56.885
metaphysical view,
according to which its

00:14:56.885 --> 00:14:59.700
something immaterial--isn't
something we see.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:04.720
It's not something we taste or
touch or smell or hear.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:12.460
We don't directly observe souls
with our five senses.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.633
You might wonder,
well, don't I sort of directly

00:15:15.633 --> 00:15:18.470
observe it in myself that I have
a soul?

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.066
Although I guess there have
been people who've made that

00:15:21.066 --> 00:15:22.860
sort of claim,
it seems false to me.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.110
I can only ask each of you to
sort of introspect for a second.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.360
Turn your mind's eye inward and
ask.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:35.470
Do you see a soul inside you?
I don't think so.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:40.934
I see things outside me.
I feel certain sensations in my

00:15:40.934 --> 00:15:44.340
body, but it doesn't seem as
though I observe a soul.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.020
Even if I believe in a soul,
I don't see it.

00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:55.149
How do we prove the existence
of things we can't see or hear

00:15:55.149 --> 00:15:58.547
or taste and so forth?
The usual method,

00:15:58.547 --> 00:16:01.883
maybe not the only method,
but the usual method is

00:16:01.883 --> 00:16:05.864
something like this.
Sometimes, we posit the

00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:11.741
existence of something that we
can't see so as to explain

00:16:11.741 --> 00:16:16.780
something else that we all agree
takes place.

00:16:20.419 --> 00:16:25.530
Why do I believe in the
existence of atoms?

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:29.668
I don't see individual atoms.
Why do I believe in the

00:16:29.668 --> 00:16:32.370
existence of atoms so small that
I can't see them?

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:38.080
Because atomic theory explains
things.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.126
When I posit the existence of
atoms with certain structures

00:16:42.126 --> 00:16:46.033
and certain sort of ways of
interacting and combining and

00:16:46.033 --> 00:16:48.916
building up,
when I posit atoms,

00:16:48.916 --> 00:16:53.656
suddenly I can explain all
sorts of things about the

00:16:53.656 --> 00:16:59.048
physical world.
So, I infer the existence of

00:16:59.048 --> 00:17:06.883
atoms based on the fact that
doing that allows me to explain

00:17:06.883 --> 00:17:14.720
things that need explaining.
This is a kind of argument that

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.939
we use all the time.
How do I posit--why do I

00:17:18.939 --> 00:17:22.410
believe in x-rays,
even though I don't see them?

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.630
Because doing that allows me to
explain certain things.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:30.930
Why do I believe in certain
planets too far away to be

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:34.930
observed directly through a
telescope?

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.889
Because positing them allows
you explain things about the

00:17:38.889 --> 00:17:42.707
rotation of the star or the
gravitational fluctuations,

00:17:42.707 --> 00:17:46.149
what have you.
We make inferences to the

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:51.355
existence of things we can't
see, when doing that helps us to

00:17:51.355 --> 00:17:55.519
explain something we can't
otherwise explain.

00:17:55.519 --> 00:18:00.518
This pattern of argument,
which is ubiquitous,

00:18:00.518 --> 00:18:05.849
is called "inference to the
best explanation."

00:18:05.849 --> 00:18:10.940
I want to emphasize this bit
about "best explanation."

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.660
What we're justified in
believing are those things that

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:18.517
we need, not simply when they
would offer us some kind of

00:18:18.517 --> 00:18:22.004
explanation,
but when they offer us the best

00:18:22.004 --> 00:18:24.619
explanation that we can think
of.

00:18:24.619 --> 00:18:27.118
So look, why am I justified in
believing in germs,

00:18:27.118 --> 00:18:30.229
various kinds of viruses that I
can't see, or bacteria or what

00:18:30.229 --> 00:18:35.871
have you, that I can't see?
Because doing that allows me to

00:18:35.871 --> 00:18:40.674
explain why people get sick.
But there's other things that

00:18:40.674 --> 00:18:42.060
would allow me to explain that
as well.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:46.167
How about demons?
I could believe in demons and

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:48.770
say, "Why does a person get sick
and die?

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:49.880
Well, it is demonic possession."

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:57.210
Why aren't I justified in
believing in the existence of

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:00.910
demons?
It's a possible explanation.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:04.643
But what we seem to be
justified in believing is not

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:08.670
just any old explanation,
but the "best explanation."

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:10.549
So we've got two rival
explanations.

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:13.346
We've got, roughly,
germ theory and we've got demon

00:19:13.346 --> 00:19:15.665
theory.
We have to ask ourselves,

00:19:15.665 --> 00:19:19.732
"Which of these does a better
job of explaining the facts

00:19:19.732 --> 00:19:22.950
about disease?"
Who gets what kinds of diseases?

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:26.554
How diseases spread,
how they can be treated or

00:19:26.554 --> 00:19:31.453
cured, when they kill somebody.
The fact of the matter is,

00:19:31.453 --> 00:19:36.880
demon theory doesn't do a very
good job of explaining disease,

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.440
while germ theory does do a
good job.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:46.295
It's the better explanation.
So we're justified in believing

00:19:46.295 --> 00:19:50.640
in germs, but not demons.
It's a matter of inference,

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:54.286
not just to any old
explanation, but inference to

00:19:54.286 --> 00:19:57.145
the best explanation.
All right, so,

00:19:57.145 --> 00:20:01.214
what we need to ask ourselves,
then, is, "What about the

00:20:01.214 --> 00:20:04.170
soul?"
We can't observe souls.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:07.710
But here's a possible way of
arguing for them.

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:13.140
Are there things that need to
be explained that we could

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:17.880
explain if we posited the
existence of a soul,

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.420
an immaterial object,
above and beyond the body?

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:25.594
Are there things that the
existence of a soul could

00:20:25.594 --> 00:20:30.602
explain and explain better than
the explanation that we would

00:20:30.602 --> 00:20:34.610
have if we had to limit
ourselves to bodies?

00:20:38.579 --> 00:20:41.253
You might put it this way as
sort of the easiest version of

00:20:41.253 --> 00:20:43.190
this kind of argument,
for our purposes.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:49.279
Are there things about us that
the physicalist cannot explain?

00:20:49.279 --> 00:20:54.351
Are there mysteries or puzzles
about people that the

00:20:54.351 --> 00:21:00.019
physicalist just draws a blank,
but if we become dualists,

00:21:00.019 --> 00:21:06.003
we can explain these features?
Suppose there was a feature

00:21:06.003 --> 00:21:09.811
like that, feature F.
Then we'd say,

00:21:09.811 --> 00:21:13.787
"Look, although we can't see
the soul, we have reason to

00:21:13.787 --> 00:21:17.727
believe in the soul,
because positing the existence

00:21:17.727 --> 00:21:22.130
of a soul helps us to explain
the existence of feature F,

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:27.646
which we all agree we've got."
Suppose it was true that you

00:21:27.646 --> 00:21:30.859
couldn't explain love from the
physicalist perspective.

00:21:30.859 --> 00:21:33.069
But we all know that people do
fall in love,

00:21:33.069 --> 00:21:35.279
but souls would allow us to
explain that.

00:21:35.279 --> 00:21:40.450
Boom, we'd have an argument for
the existence of a soul.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:42.254
It would be an example of
"inference to the best

00:21:42.254 --> 00:21:42.830
explanation."

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.343
Now, the crucial question,
of course, is,

00:21:50.343 --> 00:21:54.569
"What's the relevant feature
F?"

00:21:54.569 --> 00:21:59.565
Is there some feature that the
physicalist can't explain and so

00:21:59.565 --> 00:22:04.559
we need to appeal to something
extra-physical to explain it?

00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:09.408
Or the physicalist can only do
a rotten job of explaining,

00:22:09.408 --> 00:22:13.493
like demon theory did?
And then, if we were to appeal

00:22:13.493 --> 00:22:17.036
to something nonphysical,
we would do a better job of

00:22:17.036 --> 00:22:19.700
explaining.
If we could find the right

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.450
F, and make out the
argument, the physicalist can't

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:27.398
explain it or does a bad job of
explaining it and the dualist

00:22:27.398 --> 00:22:30.029
does a better job of explaining
it,

00:22:30.029 --> 00:22:33.269
we'd have reason to believe in
the soul.

00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:37.581
Like all arguments in
philosophy, it would be a

00:22:37.581 --> 00:22:41.292
tentative argument.
We'd sort of have some reason

00:22:41.292 --> 00:22:44.957
to believe in the soul until we
sort of see what next argument

00:22:44.957 --> 00:22:47.281
comes down the road.
But at least it would give us

00:22:47.281 --> 00:22:48.450
some reason to believe in the
soul.

00:22:52.019 --> 00:22:58.173
What I want to do is ask,
"What might feature F

00:22:58.173 --> 00:23:00.769
be?"
Is there any such feature

00:23:00.769 --> 00:23:03.006
F?
It's probably also worth

00:23:03.006 --> 00:23:06.388
underlining the fact that what
I've really been doing is

00:23:06.388 --> 00:23:08.910
running through a series of
arguments.

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:12.714
"Inference to the best
explanation" is not a single

00:23:12.714 --> 00:23:16.660
argument for the soul.
It's rather the name for a

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:20.802
kind of argument.
Depending on what F you

00:23:20.802 --> 00:23:24.586
fill in the blank with,
what pet feature or fact you're

00:23:24.586 --> 00:23:27.600
trying to explain by appeal to
the soul,

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:32.060
you get a different argument.
So let's ask ourselves,

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:37.305
"Are there things that we need
to appeal to the soul in order

00:23:37.305 --> 00:23:40.540
to explain these things about
us?"

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:44.341
Here's a first try.
Actually, let me start by

00:23:44.341 --> 00:23:47.339
saying I'm going to distinguish
two broad families of

00:23:47.339 --> 00:23:49.529
characteristics we might appeal
to.

00:23:49.529 --> 00:23:55.279
We might say,
one set of approaches focus on

00:23:55.279 --> 00:24:01.430
ordinary, familiar,
everyday facts about us.

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:04.442
The fact that we love,
the fact that we think,

00:24:04.442 --> 00:24:08.257
the fact that we experience
emotions, what have you--these

00:24:08.257 --> 00:24:12.140
are ordinary features of us.
I'm going to start with those

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:15.019
and then I'll turn,
eventually, to another set of

00:24:15.019 --> 00:24:17.779
possible things that might need
explaining,

00:24:17.779 --> 00:24:20.741
which we might think of as
extraordinary,

00:24:20.741 --> 00:24:23.743
supernatural things.
Maybe there are certain

00:24:23.743 --> 00:24:27.029
supernatural things about
communication from the dead or

00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:30.792
near-death experiences that need
to be explained in terms of the

00:24:30.792 --> 00:24:32.943
soul.
We'll get to those,

00:24:32.943 --> 00:24:37.849
but we'll start with ordinary,
everyday, hum-drum facts about

00:24:37.849 --> 00:24:39.749
us.
Even though they're ordinary

00:24:39.749 --> 00:24:41.963
and familiar,
it still could turn out that we

00:24:41.963 --> 00:24:44.580
need to appeal to souls in order
to explain them.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:50.988
So, to start, how about this?
Start with a familiar fact,

00:24:50.988 --> 00:24:55.117
which I've already drawn your
attention to a couple of times,

00:24:55.117 --> 00:24:57.869
that you can have a body that's
dead.

00:24:57.869 --> 00:25:02.661
You could have a corpse,
and that's clearly not a

00:25:02.661 --> 00:25:04.600
person.
It's not a living being.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.370
It's not a person.
It doesn't do anything.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:11.436
It just lies there;
whereas your body,

00:25:11.436 --> 00:25:15.747
my body is animated.
I move my hands around,

00:25:15.747 --> 00:25:20.385
my mouth is going up and down,
it walks from one part of the

00:25:20.385 --> 00:25:23.529
stage to the other part of the
stage.

00:25:23.529 --> 00:25:31.551
Maybe we need to appeal to the
soul in order to explain what

00:25:31.551 --> 00:25:35.857
animates the body.
The thought would be,

00:25:35.857 --> 00:25:40.618
when the soul and the body have
been separated--such the dualist

00:25:40.618 --> 00:25:45.304
explains--the soul has lost its
ability to give commands to the

00:25:45.304 --> 00:25:47.415
body.
So the body is no longer

00:25:47.415 --> 00:25:49.508
animated.
So we've got a possible

00:25:49.508 --> 00:25:53.164
explanation of the difference
between an animated and an

00:25:53.164 --> 00:25:55.890
unanimated or an inanimate body
to it.

00:25:55.890 --> 00:26:00.080
Is the soul in contact of the
right sort with the body?

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.295
There's a possible explanation.
You might say,

00:26:03.295 --> 00:26:05.420
"Look, the physicalist can't
tell us that,

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.580
because all the physical parts
are still there when you've got

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:12.737
the corpse,
at least if it's a fresh corpse

00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:17.888
before the decay has set in.
So, we need to appeal to the

00:26:17.888 --> 00:26:22.403
existence of a soul in order to
explain the animation of bodies

00:26:22.403 --> 00:26:25.170
like the ones that you and I
have."

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:30.397
Well, I said I was going to run
through a series of arguments

00:26:30.397 --> 00:26:35.799
but that doesn't mean that--the
lights have just turned off;

00:26:35.799 --> 00:26:42.803
I don't know why--that doesn't
mean that I think the arguments

00:26:42.803 --> 00:26:46.545
will all work.
I announced on the first day of

00:26:46.545 --> 00:26:49.066
class that I don't,
myself, believe in the

00:26:49.066 --> 00:26:51.752
existence of a soul.
As such, it shouldn't be any

00:26:51.752 --> 00:26:54.388
surprise to you that what I'm
going to do as we run through

00:26:54.388 --> 00:26:56.069
each of these arguments is to
say,

00:26:56.069 --> 00:26:58.970
"I'm not convinced by it and
here's why."

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:01.777
Now since I think that the
arguments I'm about to

00:27:01.777 --> 00:27:05.345
sketch--and I've just started
sketching the first of is--fails

00:27:05.345 --> 00:27:08.971
I hope you'll think it over and
you'll eventually come to agree

00:27:08.971 --> 00:27:11.015
with me,
yeah, these arguments don't

00:27:11.015 --> 00:27:14.202
really work after all.
But what's more important to me

00:27:14.202 --> 00:27:18.210
is that you at least think about
each of these arguments.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:22.869
Is this a convincing argument
for the existence of a soul?

00:27:22.869 --> 00:27:26.543
If you think so,
what response do you want to

00:27:26.543 --> 00:27:30.049
offer to the objections that I'm
giving?

00:27:30.049 --> 00:27:33.803
If this argument doesn't work,
is there another argument for

00:27:33.803 --> 00:27:37.430
the existence of a soul that you
think is a better one?

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:40.674
First argument,
you need the soul in order to

00:27:40.674 --> 00:27:43.329
explain the animation of the
body.

00:27:43.329 --> 00:27:46.665
From the physicalist point of
view, of course,

00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:49.630
the answer is going to be "too
quick."

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:54.509
To have an animated body,
you need to have a functioning

00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:57.967
body.
It's true that when you've got

00:27:57.967 --> 00:28:03.641
a corpse, you've got all the
parts there, but clearly they're

00:28:03.641 --> 00:28:08.826
not functioning properly.
But all that shows us is,

00:28:08.826 --> 00:28:13.250
the parts have broken.
Remember my stereo?

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:16.930
I dropped my stereo.
It falls on the stage.

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:20.529
It doesn't work anymore.
It stops giving off music.

00:28:20.529 --> 00:28:24.230
My boombox stops giving off
music.

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:28.148
That's not because
previously--we had a CD inside

00:28:28.148 --> 00:28:31.920
of it, we had some batteries.
We dropped the whole thing.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:37.734
It's not as though previously
there was something nonmaterial

00:28:37.734 --> 00:28:40.698
there.
We've got all the same parts

00:28:40.698 --> 00:28:43.589
there, but the parts are now
broken.

00:28:43.589 --> 00:28:46.519
They're not connected to each
other in the right way.

00:28:46.519 --> 00:28:50.275
The energy is not flowing from
the batteries through the wires

00:28:50.275 --> 00:28:51.630
to the CD component.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:00.445
There's nothing mysterious from
the physicalist perspective

00:29:00.445 --> 00:29:04.519
about the idea that a physical
object can break.

00:29:04.519 --> 00:29:08.761
Although we need to offer a
story about what makes the parts

00:29:08.761 --> 00:29:13.146
work when they're connected with
each other and interacting in

00:29:13.146 --> 00:29:16.433
the right way,
there's no need to appeal to

00:29:16.433 --> 00:29:20.397
anything beyond the physical.
Suppose we try to refine the

00:29:20.397 --> 00:29:22.415
argument.
Suppose we say,

00:29:22.415 --> 00:29:27.786
"You need to appeal to the soul
in order to explain not just

00:29:27.786 --> 00:29:32.520
that the body moves around,
flails, but the body acts

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:37.203
purposefully."
We need something to be pulling

00:29:37.203 --> 00:29:40.920
the strings, to be directing the
body.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:46.519
That's what the soul does,
so says the dualist.

00:29:46.519 --> 00:29:48.991
In response,
the physicalist is going to

00:29:48.991 --> 00:29:52.982
say, "Yes it's true that bodies
don't just move around in random

00:29:52.982 --> 00:29:55.630
patterns."
Human bodies don't do that.

00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:02.092
So we need something to direct
it, but why couldn't that just

00:30:02.092 --> 00:30:08.123
be, one particular part of the
body plays the part of the

00:30:08.123 --> 00:30:15.266
command module?
Suppose I've got a heat-seeking

00:30:15.266 --> 00:30:21.349
missile which tracks down the
plane.

00:30:21.349 --> 00:30:26.033
As the plane tries to dodge it,
the missile corrects its

00:30:26.033 --> 00:30:28.974
course.
It's not just moving randomly,

00:30:28.974 --> 00:30:32.886
it's moving purposefully.
There had better be something

00:30:32.886 --> 00:30:35.193
that explains,
that's controlling,

00:30:35.193 --> 00:30:38.212
the motions of the missile.
But for all that,

00:30:38.212 --> 00:30:41.414
it could just be a particular
piece of the missile that does

00:30:41.414 --> 00:30:41.740
it.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:49.928
More gloriously,
we could imagine building some

00:30:49.928 --> 00:30:54.759
kind of a robot that does a
variety of tasks.

00:30:54.759 --> 00:30:59.777
It's not moving randomly,
but the tasks are all

00:30:59.777 --> 00:31:04.250
controlled by the CPU within the
robot.

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:07.976
The physicalist says we don't
need to appeal to anything as

00:31:07.976 --> 00:31:11.896
extravagant as a soul in order
to explain the fact that bodies

00:31:11.896 --> 00:31:16.607
don't just move randomly,
but they move in purposeful

00:31:16.607 --> 00:31:20.441
ways that are controlled.
For each objection,

00:31:20.441 --> 00:31:23.642
there's a response.
You could imagine the dualist

00:31:23.642 --> 00:31:27.039
coming back and saying,
"Look, in the case of the

00:31:27.039 --> 00:31:30.789
heat-seeking missile or the
robot for that matter,

00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:33.809
although it's doing things,
it's just obeying orders.

00:31:33.809 --> 00:31:39.859
And the orders were given to it
from something outside itself."

00:31:39.859 --> 00:31:43.140
Something programmed the robot
or the missile.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:47.882
So don't we need there to be
something outside the body that

00:31:47.882 --> 00:31:49.910
programs the body?
That could be the soul.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.926
That's a harder question.
Must there be something outside

00:31:56.926 --> 00:32:00.394
the body that controls the body?
One possibility,

00:32:00.394 --> 00:32:03.506
of course, is,
why not say that people are

00:32:03.506 --> 00:32:08.059
just robots as well and we get
our commands from outside?

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:14.140
On a familiar religious view,
God built Adam out of dirt,

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.717
out of dust.
Adam is just a certain kind of

00:32:17.717 --> 00:32:20.780
robot then.
God breathes into Adam.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:25.673
That's sort of turning it on.
Maybe people are just robots

00:32:25.673 --> 00:32:28.876
commanded from outside by God.
But that doesn't mean that

00:32:28.876 --> 00:32:30.570
there's anything more to us than
there is to the robot.

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:39.792
That's one possible response.
A different response,

00:32:39.792 --> 00:32:43.983
of course, is why couldn't we
have robots that just build more

00:32:43.983 --> 00:32:46.023
robots?
Then, if you ask,

00:32:46.023 --> 00:32:48.890
"Where did the commands come
from?"

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:51.179
the answer is,
"When they were built,

00:32:51.179 --> 00:32:54.994
they were built in such a way
as to have certain instructions

00:32:54.994 --> 00:32:58.789
that they begin to follow out."
Just like people have a genetic

00:32:58.789 --> 00:33:00.561
code, perhaps,
that gives us various

00:33:00.561 --> 00:33:02.789
instructions that we begin to
follow out,

00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:06.839
or certain innate psychology or
what have you.

00:33:06.839 --> 00:33:11.650
The argument quickly becomes
very, very messy.

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:16.244
The fan of the soul begins to
want to protest,

00:33:16.244 --> 00:33:21.126
"Look, we're not just robots.
We're not just robots with some

00:33:21.126 --> 00:33:23.950
sort of program in our brain
that we're following.

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:29.289
We've got free will.
Robots can't have free will.

00:33:29.289 --> 00:33:31.400
So there's got to be something
more to us than robots.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.160
We can't just be physical
things."

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.931
This is an interesting
argument, and I think it's a new

00:33:38.931 --> 00:33:41.870
argument.
We started with the idea you

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:46.211
needed to appeal to souls in
order to roughly explain why

00:33:46.211 --> 00:33:49.864
human bodies move,
why we're animated or why we

00:33:49.864 --> 00:33:54.257
move in nonrandom ways.
I think it's fairly clear that

00:33:54.257 --> 00:33:59.130
you don't need to appeal to
souls in order to do that.

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:02.382
Appeal to a physical body
suffices, I think,

00:34:02.382 --> 00:34:06.392
to have an explanation as to
the difference between an

00:34:06.392 --> 00:34:10.349
animated and an inanimate body,
how bodies will move in

00:34:10.349 --> 00:34:13.135
nonrandom ways.
If the brain is our CPU,

00:34:13.135 --> 00:34:17.199
then we'll behave in
deliberate, purposeful ways just

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:21.809
like a robot will behave in
deliberate, purposeful ways.

00:34:21.809 --> 00:34:26.210
So this initial argument,
I think, is not compelling.

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:29.969
Still, we might wonder,
what about this new argument?

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:33.679
What about the fact that--We
said there's a family of

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:37.460
arguments, all of which have the
general structure,

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.361
inference to the best
explanation, you need souls in

00:34:40.361 --> 00:34:42.409
order to explain feature
F.

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:45.482
Plug in a different feature
F and you get a new

00:34:45.482 --> 00:34:48.030
argument.
The one we started with--you

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:51.782
need the soul to explain the
animation of the body--that

00:34:51.782 --> 00:34:54.170
argument, I think,
doesn't work.

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:58.956
Now we've got a new one.
You need the soul in order to

00:34:58.956 --> 00:35:02.724
explain free will.
Let me come back to that

00:35:02.724 --> 00:35:04.519
argument later.
It's a good argument.

00:35:04.519 --> 00:35:06.736
It's an argument well worth
taking seriously,

00:35:06.736 --> 00:35:08.449
but let's come back to it
later.

00:35:08.449 --> 00:35:12.130
First, let's run through some
other things that might be

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:15.409
appealed to as candidates for
feature F.

00:35:15.409 --> 00:35:18.688
Suppose somebody says,
"Look, it's true that we don't

00:35:18.688 --> 00:35:22.346
need to appeal to souls in order
to explain why bodies move

00:35:22.346 --> 00:35:26.585
around in a nonrandom fashion.
But people have a very special

00:35:26.585 --> 00:35:30.845
ability"--and so the argument
goes--"that mere bodies couldn't

00:35:30.845 --> 00:35:33.360
have, physicalists can't
explain.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:39.780
That's the ability to think.
It's the ability to reason.

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:47.509
People have beliefs and desires.
And based on their beliefs

00:35:47.509 --> 00:35:53.890
about how to fulfill their
desires, they make plans.

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:59.449
They have strategies.
They reason about what to do.

00:35:59.449 --> 00:36:04.448
This tightly connected set of
facts about us--beliefs,

00:36:04.448 --> 00:36:07.750
desires, reasoning,
strategizing,

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:14.492
planning--you need to appeal to
a soul"--so the argument

00:36:14.492 --> 00:36:22.580
goes--;"to explain that.
No mere machine could believe.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:32.840
No mere machine has desires.
No mere machine could reason."

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:37.986
It's easy to see why you might
think that sort of thing when

00:36:37.986 --> 00:36:42.167
you stick to simple machines.
It's pretty clear that there

00:36:42.167 --> 00:36:45.280
are lots of machines that it
doesn't seem natural to ascribe

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.760
beliefs or desires or goals or
reasoning to.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:51.365
My lawnmower,
for example,

00:36:51.365 --> 00:36:57.425
doesn't want to cut the grass.
Even though it does cut the

00:36:57.425 --> 00:36:59.300
grass, it doesn't have the
desire.

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:04.340
It doesn't think to itself,
"How shall I get that blade of

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:09.597
grass that's been eluding me?"
So it's easy to see why we

00:37:09.597 --> 00:37:15.479
might be tempted to say no mere
machine could think or reason or

00:37:15.479 --> 00:37:20.020
have beliefs or desires.
That argument's much less

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:24.789
compelling nowadays than I think
it would have been 20 or 40

00:37:24.789 --> 00:37:29.154
years ago.
In an era of computers with

00:37:29.154 --> 00:37:35.170
quite sophisticated computer
programs, it seems,

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:39.980
at the very least,
natural to talk about beliefs,

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:44.190
desires, and reasoning and
strategizing.

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:49.049
So suppose, for example,
we've got a chess-playing

00:37:49.049 --> 00:37:52.151
computer.
On my computer at home I've got

00:37:52.151 --> 00:37:55.330
a program that allows my
computer to play chess.

00:37:55.330 --> 00:38:04.380
I, myself, stink at chess.
This program can beat me blind.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:12.019
I move my bishop,
the computer moves its queen.

00:38:12.019 --> 00:38:14.710
What do we say about the
computer?

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:19.230
Why did the computer move its
queen, or virtual queen?

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.219
Why did the computer move its
queen?

00:38:21.219 --> 00:38:27.456
The natural thing to say is,
it's worried about the fact

00:38:27.456 --> 00:38:33.578
that the king is exposed and
it's trying to block me by

00:38:33.578 --> 00:38:38.530
capturing my bishop.
That is what we say about

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:43.099
computer-playing programs.
Think about what we're doing.

00:38:43.099 --> 00:38:46.949
We're ascribing desires to the
program.

00:38:46.949 --> 00:38:50.389
We're saying it's got an
ultimate desire to win the game.

00:38:50.389 --> 00:38:54.051
A certain subsidiary desire is
to protect its king,

00:38:54.051 --> 00:38:56.704
to capture my king.
A certain other subsidiary

00:38:56.704 --> 00:38:58.761
desire is, no doubt,
to protect its various other

00:38:58.761 --> 00:39:02.267
pieces along the way.
It's got beliefs about how to

00:39:02.267 --> 00:39:07.223
do that by blocking certain
paths or by making other pieces

00:39:07.223 --> 00:39:11.389
on my side vulnerable.
It's got beliefs about how to

00:39:11.389 --> 00:39:14.768
achieve its goals.
Then, it puts those

00:39:14.768 --> 00:39:21.131
combinations of beliefs and
desires into action by moving in

00:39:21.131 --> 00:39:26.199
a way that's a rational response
to my move.

00:39:26.199 --> 00:39:29.579
It looks as though the natural
thing to say about the

00:39:29.579 --> 00:39:32.830
chess-playing computer is,
it does have beliefs.

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:36.090
It does have desires.
It does have intentions.

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:39.200
It does have goals.
It does reason.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:44.896
It does all of this.
It's rational to this limited

00:39:44.896 --> 00:39:47.480
extent.
It's only able to play chess.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.117
But to that extent,
it's doing all these things and

00:39:51.117 --> 00:39:55.482
yet we're not tempted to say,
are we, that the computer has a

00:39:55.482 --> 00:40:00.081
nonphysical part?
We can explain how the computer

00:40:00.081 --> 00:40:04.539
does all of this in strictly
physical terms.

00:40:04.539 --> 00:40:08.909
Of course, once you start
thinking of it this way,

00:40:08.909 --> 00:40:14.260
it's natural to talk this way
across a variety of things that

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:17.560
the computer may be trying to
do.

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:25.750
It's perfectly open to you,
as dualists,

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:31.343
to respond by saying,
"Although we personify the

00:40:31.343 --> 00:40:35.798
computer,
we treat it as though it was a

00:40:35.798 --> 00:40:41.519
person, as though it had beliefs
and desires and so forth,

00:40:41.519 --> 00:40:45.312
it doesn't really have the
relevant beliefs and desires,

00:40:45.312 --> 00:40:48.760
because it doesn't have any
beliefs and desires,

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:56.889
because no physical object
could have beliefs and desires."

00:40:56.889 --> 00:41:00.575
In response to that,
I just want to say,

00:41:00.575 --> 00:41:06.360
"Isn't that just prejudice?"
Of course, it is true that if

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:12.465
we simply insist no physical
object could really have beliefs

00:41:12.465 --> 00:41:16.102
or desires,
then it will follow that when

00:41:16.102 --> 00:41:19.916
we are tempted to ascribe
beliefs and desires to my

00:41:19.916 --> 00:41:25.230
chess-playing computer,
we're falling into an illusion.

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:30.684
That will follow once we assume
that no physical object has

00:41:30.684 --> 00:41:35.460
beliefs or desires.
But what reason is there for

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:39.159
saying it has no beliefs or
desires?

00:41:39.159 --> 00:41:45.307
What grounds are there for
withholding ascriptions of

00:41:45.307 --> 00:41:49.800
beliefs and desires to the
computer?

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.370
That's far from obvious.

00:41:56.970 --> 00:42:04.752
Here's a possibility.
Desires, at the very least,

00:42:04.752 --> 00:42:11.423
seem to be, at least in typical
cases, very closely tied to a

00:42:11.423 --> 00:42:16.960
series of emotions.
You get excited when you're

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:24.173
playing chess at the prospect of
capturing my queen and crushing

00:42:24.173 --> 00:42:28.620
me.
You get worried when your

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:34.636
pieces are threatened.
Of course, more generally,

00:42:34.636 --> 00:42:38.864
you get excited,
your heart goes pitter-pat,

00:42:38.864 --> 00:42:44.369
when your girlfriend or
boyfriend says they love you.

00:42:44.369 --> 00:42:48.668
Your stomach sinks,
you have that sinking feeling

00:42:48.668 --> 00:42:53.683
in the pit of your stomach,
when you get a bad grade on a

00:42:53.683 --> 00:42:58.578
test.
Maybe what's really going on is

00:42:58.578 --> 00:43:05.700
the thought that there's an
aspect of desire that has a

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:11.192
purely behavioral side,
that's moving pieces around in

00:43:11.192 --> 00:43:14.630
a way that would make sense if
you had this goal.

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:20.370
And maybe machines can do that.
But there's an aspect of

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:25.582
desires, the emotional side,
that machines can't have,

00:43:25.582 --> 00:43:30.970
but we clearly do have.
Maybe we want to build that

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:34.849
emotional side into talk of
desires.

00:43:34.849 --> 00:43:38.328
So maybe if we want to say
machines don't have a mental

00:43:38.328 --> 00:43:40.840
life and couldn't have a mental
life,

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:45.386
what we really mean is no
machine could feel anything

00:43:45.386 --> 00:43:46.610
emotionally.

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:54.167
So let's distinguish.
Let's say there's a way of

00:43:54.167 --> 00:43:59.492
talking about beliefs and
desires which is just going to

00:43:59.492 --> 00:44:04.624
be captured in terms of
responding in a way that makes

00:44:04.624 --> 00:44:10.350
sense given the environment.
Maybe computers and robots

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:14.265
could do that.
But there's clearly a side of

00:44:14.265 --> 00:44:17.228
our mental life,
the emotional side,

00:44:17.228 --> 00:44:21.970
where we might really worry,
could a robot feel love?

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:28.803
Could it be afraid of anything?
Again, our question was,

00:44:28.803 --> 00:44:33.800
"Do we need to appeal to souls
to explain something about us?"

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:37.250
The physicalist says "no";
the dualist says "yes."

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:42.051
If what we mean is the mental,
but that the aspect,

00:44:42.051 --> 00:44:45.699
the behavioral aspect of the
mental,

00:44:45.699 --> 00:44:49.084
where even a chess-playing
computer probably has it,

00:44:49.084 --> 00:44:52.070
then that's not a very
compelling argument.

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:54.556
The physicalist will say,
"Look, that aspect of the

00:44:54.556 --> 00:44:58.127
mental is pretty clear.
We can explain it in physical

00:44:58.127 --> 00:45:00.048
terms."
But let's just switch the

00:45:00.048 --> 00:45:04.560
argument.
What about emotions?

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:14.298
Can a robot feel emotions?
Could a purely physical being

00:45:14.298 --> 00:45:18.860
fall in love?
Could it be afraid of things?

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:25.090
Could it hope for something?
The latest version of our

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:31.320
argument then is,
"People can feel emotions.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:35.079
But if you think about it,
it's pretty clear no robot

00:45:35.079 --> 00:45:38.989
could feel emotions.
No merely physical thing could

00:45:38.989 --> 00:45:42.542
feel emotions.
So there must be more to us

00:45:42.542 --> 00:45:47.077
than a merely physical thing."
That's the argument we'll start

00:45:47.077 --> 00:45:48.143
with next time.

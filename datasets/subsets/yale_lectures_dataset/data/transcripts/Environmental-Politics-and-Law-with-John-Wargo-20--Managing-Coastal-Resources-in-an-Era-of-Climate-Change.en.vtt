00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.305
Prof: So I want to
continue talking today about

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:07.764
land use and the special problem
that we face in managing land

00:00:07.764 --> 00:00:10.260
use and development in the
coastal zone.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.120
Why the coastal zone?
 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.570
Well, for several really
important reasons.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.960
One is that it's under enormous
development pressure.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.560
People often want to live in
urban areas.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.840
They often want to live in
coastal environments.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.558
But also, a coastal zone is
experiencing increased risk of

00:00:29.558 --> 00:00:32.337
damage from storms,
sea level rise,

00:00:32.337 --> 00:00:36.230
and increased pollution that's
also associated with density.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.970
So I want to talk today about
the variety of strategies that

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.710
might be used to control
development in the coastal zone.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.000
So I thought I'd start out with
a little cartoon.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.338
Good news, at the current rate
of global warming,

00:00:50.338 --> 00:00:53.359
we should be able to just swim
over there and eat them in under

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:54.090
five years.
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.470
So within the world,
640,650 million people live in

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.603
the coastal zone that are at
some risk of property loss or

00:01:05.603 --> 00:01:08.938
injury from intense storms.
 

00:01:08.938 --> 00:01:12.751
And the ten countries with the
largest number of people living

00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:16.438
in vulnerable low-elevation
coastal zones include China,

00:01:16.438 --> 00:01:19.019
India, Bangladesh,
Vietnam, Indonesia,

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:21.301
Japan, Egypt,
the U.S., Thailand and the

00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:22.120
Philippines.
 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.390
So that the overwhelming
majority of people that live in

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.281
the coastal zone in the world do
not have the capacity to manage

00:01:31.281 --> 00:01:33.690
the hazards that they face.
 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.830
And the variety of legal and
economic strategies that might

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.616
be used to prevent serious
damage is the subject of the

00:01:43.616 --> 00:01:44.680
lecture.
 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.301
So the growth of cities in the
coastal zone is a significant

00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:52.970
issue to pay attention to.
 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.860
So that on average,
coastal cities are growing

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.340
twenty percent faster than any
other cities in the world.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.522
And they have ten to fifteen
percent higher densities than

00:02:00.522 --> 00:02:01.358
other cities.
 

00:02:01.358 --> 00:02:04.599
And of the twenty megacities in
the world, fifteen of them are

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:05.608
in coastal areas.
 

00:02:05.608 --> 00:02:08.556
Now, within the U.S.,
we have a statute called the

00:02:08.556 --> 00:02:10.360
Coastal Zone Management Act.
 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.677
And the act is administered by
the National Oceanic and

00:02:13.677 --> 00:02:15.460
Atmospheric Administration.
 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.110
And it provides for management
of the nation's coastal zones as

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.810
well as the resources found
there.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.878
And it includes the Great
Lakes, as well as the sea coast.

00:02:26.878 --> 00:02:31.141
And it's designed to balance
economic development and promote

00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:34.907
economic development at the same
time that it promotes

00:02:34.907 --> 00:02:37.110
environmental conservation.
 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.848
So it has a tension built into
the mission statement of the

00:02:38.848 --> 00:02:39.150
statute.
 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.613
Now, there was great debate
within the Nixon Administration

00:02:42.613 --> 00:02:46.016
about the structure of this
statute and what kind of teeth

00:02:46.016 --> 00:02:47.508
would be put into it.
 

00:02:47.508 --> 00:02:50.562
Should the federal government
get involved in the regulation

00:02:50.562 --> 00:02:53.091
of land use,
the way that the State of New

00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:56.351
York got involved in the
regulation of private land use

00:02:56.351 --> 00:02:57.680
in the Adirondacks?
 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.620
And there were forces inside
the Nixon Administration,

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.280
Republican administration,
you'll recall,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.030
that argued quite extensively
that we needed to protect land

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.780
areas in the coastal zone and
that the cost to the nation in

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.530
terms of bearing liability and
responsibility for rebuilding

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.038
damaged areas was growing and
was going to be potentially

00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:25.729
overwhelming.
 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:30.060
So that the overall objectives
are conflicting and include the

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.917
phrase,
"preserve,

00:03:31.917 --> 00:03:34.246
protect, develop,
and where possible,

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:36.554
to restore or enhance the
resources of the nation's

00:03:36.554 --> 00:03:37.568
coastal zone."
 

00:03:37.568 --> 00:03:42.176
We also have a coincidental
statute that's created the

00:03:42.176 --> 00:03:45.220
National Flood Insurance
Program.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.449
But that program is now
essentially bankrupt.

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:53.662
So the Federal Flood Insurance
Program faces major financial

00:03:53.662 --> 00:03:56.730
difficulties,
particularly as the Gulf Coast

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.660
recovers.
 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.139
It's essentially bankrupt.
 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.187
The Federal Emergency
Management Agency officials

00:04:02.187 --> 00:04:06.122
estimate that Hurricanes Katrina
and Rita together would result

00:04:06.122 --> 00:04:09.550
in flood insurance claims of
about twenty-three billion

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.438
dollars.
 

00:04:10.438 --> 00:04:15.264
Well it turns out that when you
total up the costs of emergency

00:04:15.264 --> 00:04:18.336
response,
property restoration,

00:04:18.336 --> 00:04:23.629
the healthcare requirements
associated with these two

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:26.095
storms,
it's not twenty three billion

00:04:26.095 --> 00:04:27.843
dollars,
it's in the hundreds of

00:04:27.843 --> 00:04:29.740
billions of dollars that the
U.S.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.069
government expended.
 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:36.699
So should coastal property be
insured by the public sector?

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.459
What kinds of alternatives
might there be?

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:44.041
And the Federal Flood Insurance
Program has encouraged people to

00:04:44.041 --> 00:04:47.459
build in the coastal areas that
are at risk,

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:51.240
and it offers them a subsidized
low rate of insurance.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.291
So that in the event of storm
damage, property damage,

00:04:55.291 --> 00:04:59.495
flooding, the government steps
in and basically provides

00:04:59.495 --> 00:05:02.629
low-cost insurance so people
rebuild.

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:05.291
So what are the variety of
management strategies that you

00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:07.860
might use, the different kinds
of legal instruments?

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.439
Well, there are certain
questions that you might

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.990
address.
 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.954
You know, how should we go
about protecting open lands in

00:05:13.954 --> 00:05:14.959
the coastal area?
 

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:16.660
Should they be public?
 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.649
Should they be private?
 

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:20.410
Should we employ land use
regulation?

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.997
Should it be managed by local
governments as it traditionally

00:05:23.997 --> 00:05:26.930
has been through much of the
twentieth century?

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.160
State governments?
 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.449
Or should the federal
government step in?

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.648
And I'll give you a couple of
examples over the next 45

00:05:33.648 --> 00:05:36.964
minutes that will show you how
the federal government has

00:05:36.964 --> 00:05:40.637
stepped in and applied eminent
domain to purchase up open areas

00:05:40.637 --> 00:05:43.303
and resources that the
government thought were

00:05:43.303 --> 00:05:46.680
particularly valuable,
not just because of their

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.497
ecological characteristics,
but also because they provided

00:05:50.497 --> 00:05:54.521
recreational opportunities,
particularly in the vicinity of

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.250
these population centers.
 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.449
So insurance,
whether or not the insurance

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:03.822
program should be continued,
whether or not the subsidies

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:07.569
should be removed,
this is an open question.

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:09.629
How about transferable
development rights?

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:13.675
I'll speak about this in a few
moments, but the idea behind

00:06:13.675 --> 00:06:18.209
transferable development rights
is that you have a source zone.

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:22.994
So that if a zone is set up,
a zoning scheme is set up and

00:06:22.994 --> 00:06:28.029
one area is more restricted to
limit development than another

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:31.127
area,
the restricted area might have

00:06:31.127 --> 00:06:35.492
some sort of a scheme where they
could transfer a credit to

00:06:35.492 --> 00:06:39.029
develop to another area or a
receiving zone.

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:42.086
So you might think about it as
having a sending zone and a

00:06:42.086 --> 00:06:43.000
receiving zone.
 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.848
So that if you are restricted,
you can't build on your

00:06:45.848 --> 00:06:48.750
property because you're lying
within a flood plain,

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.637
you're lying say adjacent to a
wetland or next to the

00:06:52.637 --> 00:06:54.786
shoreline,
then you don't lose your

00:06:54.786 --> 00:06:55.569
property value.
 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:59.050
So that this idea of
transferable development rights

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.939
does an end run around the
question about compensation.

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:07.444
So that it avoids the
possibility of litigation based

00:07:07.444 --> 00:07:12.470
upon the Fifth Amendment that we
described, went through on

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:13.509
Tuesday.
 

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:17.303
So thinking about-- you see,
I've repeated insurance twice

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:17.769
here.
 

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:19.670
Thinking about the idea of
easements.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.420
So that the government could go
into an area and buy up some of

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.329
the development rights but not
all of it.

00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:29.468
So the complete bundle of
rights might be broken up into

00:07:29.468 --> 00:07:31.149
bits and pieces.
 

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:34.754
You could also imagine a
statute that would employ a

00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:37.230
variety of different tax
schemes.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.329
They might be property tax
related, so that property taxes

00:07:41.329 --> 00:07:45.500
could be elevated in areas that
are especially valuable.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.363
And they might be lower in
areas that are further away from

00:07:49.363 --> 00:07:52.029
the coast, outside of the hazard
zone.

00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:54.829
And you might think also about
income tax credits.

00:07:54.829 --> 00:07:58.422
I mean, what if you received an
income tax credit when you

00:07:58.422 --> 00:08:01.509
purchased property that was in a
low-risk area?

00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:04.519
Or in an area that had lower
resource values?

00:08:04.519 --> 00:08:09.329
And also, the idea of payment
for ecosystem services.

00:08:09.329 --> 00:08:11.079
Now, what would that mean?
 

00:08:11.079 --> 00:08:12.550
What are ecosystem services?
 

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.985
Well, I mean,
the coastal zone in its natural

00:08:15.985 --> 00:08:19.028
condition plays many different
roles.

00:08:19.028 --> 00:08:22.935
And I'll show you some photos
in a moment that demonstrate the

00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:26.165
flood storage capacity,
but also the biological

00:08:26.165 --> 00:08:29.160
diversity is often higher in
coastal areas.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.812
And also recreational
opportunities,

00:08:31.812 --> 00:08:35.148
marine fisheries,
the commercial value of the

00:08:35.148 --> 00:08:38.178
coastal zone is extremely
important.

00:08:38.178 --> 00:08:43.267
Nearly seventy-five percent of
marine fisheries that are

00:08:43.267 --> 00:08:49.001
commercially caught spend some
portion of their life in coastal

00:08:49.001 --> 00:08:52.340
estuaries,
in wetlands areas.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.570
And many of the coastlines of
the United States,

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:02.058
they're ringed by thin bands of
sand that are known as barrier

00:09:02.058 --> 00:09:03.139
islands.
 

00:09:03.139 --> 00:09:08.971
And these barriers basically
act to protect the inland areas

00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:11.740
from intense storm damage.
 

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:15.662
So that thinking about the
variety of protective services

00:09:15.662 --> 00:09:20.076
and recreational and commercial
opportunities in addition to the

00:09:20.076 --> 00:09:24.208
property value opportunities
that most local governments are

00:09:24.208 --> 00:09:25.399
looking at.
 

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:26.960
And why would that be?
 

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.082
Well local governments get
their primary source of tax

00:09:31.082 --> 00:09:35.517
revenue to offer all of their
services predominately based

00:09:35.517 --> 00:09:38.240
upon the valuation of property.
 

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.019
So as development increases in
any town,

00:09:41.019 --> 00:09:44.023
in any municipality,
it offers increased opportunity

00:09:44.023 --> 00:09:47.380
for a local or a municipal
government to secure additional

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:47.970
taxes.
 

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.950
So payments for ecosystem
services.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.808
Now what might that be?
 

00:09:52.808 --> 00:09:58.942
Well, supposing you have
someone who wants to develop in

00:09:58.942 --> 00:10:02.602
a wetland area,
and you have created a

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:06.888
regulation or a statute that
offers specific protection of

00:10:06.888 --> 00:10:07.788
wetlands.
 

00:10:07.788 --> 00:10:12.620
And wetlands are protected in
the United States under the

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:16.847
Clean Water Act if they're
adjacent to a navigable

00:10:16.847 --> 00:10:17.970
waterway.
 

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:21.009
But many states have also
adopted their own protective

00:10:21.009 --> 00:10:22.100
wetland statutes.
 

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.980
And many local governments have
also filed suit.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.182
So these areas that are
seasonally wet or marshy or

00:10:29.182 --> 00:10:32.628
parts of estuaries,
they get special legal

00:10:32.628 --> 00:10:35.570
attention in the United States.
 

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:40.715
So now imagine that you decided
that you wanted to curtail any

00:10:40.715 --> 00:10:46.029
future development in a wetland
or an endangered species habitat

00:10:46.029 --> 00:10:47.970
or in a flood zone.
 

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.082
Well, basically,
if somebody wanted to develop

00:10:51.082 --> 00:10:54.956
there, you might give them a
credit so that they could do

00:10:54.956 --> 00:10:55.580
that.
 

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.899
They may have to pay extra.
 

00:10:57.899 --> 00:11:01.688
And that money could go into a
bank, basically an ecosystem

00:11:01.688 --> 00:11:02.668
service bank.
 

00:11:02.668 --> 00:11:05.721
And there are now banks that
have been created in the United

00:11:05.721 --> 00:11:08.928
States and in different parts of
the world where developers are

00:11:08.928 --> 00:11:11.830
developing in sensitive areas,
they're allowed to do that.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:17.004
But they have to pay into this
bank and then that money is used

00:11:17.004 --> 00:11:21.009
to restore resources that have
been degraded,

00:11:21.009 --> 00:11:23.428
perhaps in the same watershed,
perhaps in the same

00:11:23.428 --> 00:11:24.168
municipality.
 

00:11:24.168 --> 00:11:31.822
Or the funds might be used to
purchase land to offer greater

00:11:31.822 --> 00:11:33.509
protection.
 

00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:37.259
And the trade is rarely
conducted on an acre per acre or

00:11:37.259 --> 00:11:39.168
hectare per hectare basis.
 

00:11:39.168 --> 00:11:43.678
Normally, you require the
developer to pay for protection

00:11:43.678 --> 00:11:48.509
at some multiple of the scale of
the original development.

00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:52.870
So it might be a one for three,
or one for four acre trade.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:56.405
The developer gets to develop
one acre but then he's literally

00:11:56.405 --> 00:11:58.899
financing the protection of
another area.

00:11:58.899 --> 00:12:03.510
So this form of credit creation
and purchase and banking is

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:07.090
becoming much more common around
the world.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.485
And if you think about the
similarity to this between the

00:12:10.485 --> 00:12:13.820
cap in trade idea that we
discussed when we were talking

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.580
about the Clean Air Act and the
sulfur dioxide provisions.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.028
Remember that in the Ohio
Valley and up through the

00:12:21.028 --> 00:12:24.649
northeastern United States,
you had this cap put on

00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:28.086
CO_2 emission
allowances for all the power

00:12:28.086 --> 00:12:28.759
plants.
 

00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:34.779
And that allowed a trading
scheme to evolve so that as the

00:12:34.779 --> 00:12:40.798
ceiling for total allowable
SO_2 diminished,

00:12:40.798 --> 00:12:45.168
it made the allowances much
more valuable.

00:12:45.168 --> 00:12:50.375
So that those that emitted the
lowest levels of SO_2

00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:55.581
received credits that they could
then sell to those industries

00:12:55.581 --> 00:12:59.539
that wanted to keep polluting,
they didn't want to invest in

00:12:59.539 --> 00:13:01.480
the technology,
perhaps a scrubber.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.639
So this idea is very similar to
what's being discussed with

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:08.964
respect to carbon trading,
but also it has great

00:13:08.964 --> 00:13:11.868
similarity to these other
concepts about ecosystem

00:13:11.868 --> 00:13:12.580
services.
 

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:16.182
So that the underlying
requirement is there has to be

00:13:16.182 --> 00:13:20.408
some sort of a legal threshold
that's easily identifiable,

00:13:20.408 --> 00:13:24.274
and some sort of a trading
formula that is set up in order

00:13:24.274 --> 00:13:26.240
for these to be functional.
 

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:30.015
So here is a suite of different
kinds of management

00:13:30.015 --> 00:13:31.149
alternatives.
 

00:13:31.149 --> 00:13:35.900
Now, as you think about the
vulnerability of property and

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:40.653
life in the coastal zone,
I want you to be thinking about

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.350
it ecologically.
 

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:45.774
I want you to think about what
principles of ecology or

00:13:45.774 --> 00:13:49.389
understanding of ecosystems and
how they're structured and

00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:52.178
function and how they change
over time,

00:13:52.178 --> 00:13:55.470
what principles should you have
in mind as you're thinking about

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.820
selection among these different
strategies?

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.422
And I think that one of the
intellectual pioneers of this

00:14:01.422 --> 00:14:04.960
idea of tying the science of
ecology with law that would

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.918
somehow control the way that we
use land,

00:14:07.918 --> 00:14:11.379
it was pioneered by Ian McHarg,
a relatively famous landscape

00:14:11.379 --> 00:14:14.090
architect at the University of
Pennsylvania,

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:19.062
and the individual that really
I give credit to for inspiring

00:14:19.062 --> 00:14:21.879
me to do what I do with my life.
 

00:14:21.879 --> 00:14:25.025
Now, I want you to think just
carefully about population

00:14:25.025 --> 00:14:27.200
concentrations in the United
States.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.272
Just swirling quickly here,
here's Boston,

00:14:31.272 --> 00:14:35.147
Massachusetts,
Providence, Rhode Island,

00:14:35.147 --> 00:14:39.220
New York City,
this is San Francisco.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:43.028
So think about the density of
property and population that

00:14:43.028 --> 00:14:44.899
lives in the coastal zone.
 

00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:48.350
So that if you calculate the
proportion of the U.S.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:51.379
population that lives in
coastal counties,

00:14:51.379 --> 00:14:54.408
it's now over fifty percent of
the U.S.

00:14:54.408 --> 00:14:57.090
population that lives in these
shaded areas.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:01.798
And the areas of most rapid
growth include the northeastern

00:15:01.798 --> 00:15:05.207
part of the U.S.,
particularly southern New

00:15:05.207 --> 00:15:07.399
Hampshire and Cape Cod.
 

00:15:07.399 --> 00:15:10.629
Also, Long Island,
but parts of Maryland.

00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:12.528
And also Florida.
 

00:15:12.528 --> 00:15:16.279
And Florida is experiencing
just a continued enormous

00:15:16.279 --> 00:15:16.928
growth.
 

00:15:16.928 --> 00:15:20.955
Twenty-five percent of the
vacation homes in the United

00:15:20.955 --> 00:15:23.490
States are now owned in Florida.
 

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.058
And I'm going to pause here,
and I hope that this works.

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:32.629
I'm going to pause here to see
if I can call up Google Earth.

00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:35.558
Because many of you perhaps
have not been to Florida.

00:15:35.558 --> 00:15:41.033
But I'll take you on just a
very quick Google Earth Cook's

00:15:41.033 --> 00:15:43.340
tour of the coastline.
 

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:49.259
First starting out in the Miami
Beach area,

00:15:49.259 --> 00:15:53.850
and here, as we zoom in,
you begin to see the intensity

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:57.442
of development,
but you also are looking at a

00:15:57.442 --> 00:15:58.580
barrier island.
 

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.440
This is one of those thin
strands of sand,

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.543
in this case,
maybe a quarter to a third of a

00:16:04.543 --> 00:16:08.883
mile in width,
that in its natural form it

00:16:08.883 --> 00:16:14.899
buffers the energy from waves
and storms so that that energy

00:16:14.899 --> 00:16:20.100
doesn't normally affect the bay
shore over here.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:25.874
So that this barrier island
wants to migrate in a landward

00:16:25.874 --> 00:16:27.090
direction.
 

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:28.932
So this poses a really
interesting kind of a legal

00:16:28.932 --> 00:16:29.308
problem.
 

00:16:29.308 --> 00:16:33.684
If you're managing the
development of an Adirondack

00:16:33.684 --> 00:16:38.937
mountain, you don't have the
same ecological dynamic going on

00:16:38.937 --> 00:16:40.600
as you do here.
 

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.408
Because this is basically just
a big pile of sand,

00:16:43.408 --> 00:16:46.158
and it's shaped by wind,
it's shaped by waves.

00:16:46.158 --> 00:16:51.052
And basically,
it literally wants to roll over

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:54.639
itself in a landward direction.
 

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:58.294
So if you take a look at say
Cape Hatteras or Assateague

00:16:58.294 --> 00:17:02.018
Island or some of the other
national parks that have been

00:17:02.018 --> 00:17:04.808
established on these barrier
islands,

00:17:04.808 --> 00:17:08.170
you'll actually see them
migrating in a landward

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.652
direction,
often at a rate of maybe two to

00:17:11.652 --> 00:17:15.118
four to five feet per year,
depending upon storm intensity.

00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:19.519
And in a natural condition,
in the bay,

00:17:19.519 --> 00:17:24.385
you would see wetlands and it
would be a very active nursery

00:17:24.385 --> 00:17:28.180
for a variety of commercial
marine species,

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.068
as I mentioned earlier.
 

00:17:29.068 --> 00:17:32.199
But as you zone in,
what you can see here is the

00:17:32.199 --> 00:17:36.260
property values in urban areas
have just gone so high that the

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.990
intensity of development is
really quite remarkable.

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:43.361
So that Miami Beach,
of course you have the hotels

00:17:43.361 --> 00:17:46.868
right on the beach with the
cabanas on the beach.

00:17:46.868 --> 00:17:51.525
As you move further north,
you see that the sandy area was

00:17:51.525 --> 00:17:54.220
transformed into a golf course.
 

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.384
And over here in the Sunset
Islands area,

00:17:57.384 --> 00:18:00.549
just think about what this used
to be.

00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:02.038
This used to be a salt marsh.
 

00:18:02.038 --> 00:18:04.957
And the salt marsh was
basically transformed by

00:18:04.957 --> 00:18:07.971
dredging up the wetland areas,
the estuary,

00:18:07.971 --> 00:18:12.354
and piling up that soil and
bringing in concrete and other

00:18:12.354 --> 00:18:16.890
materials to create these
remarkable little communities.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:21.030
So people are able to drive to
these communities and also park

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.390
their boats there.
 

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:26.174
So that each one of these
artificial islands has created

00:18:26.174 --> 00:18:29.821
roughly seventy-five to a
hundred different lots at an

00:18:29.821 --> 00:18:32.288
average price,
selling price,

00:18:32.288 --> 00:18:34.940
in the 1970s,
'80s, and 1990s,

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:39.500
that was approaching a million
dollars.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.741
So just to buy the property
alone, regardless of the cost of

00:18:43.741 --> 00:18:46.690
building, would cost a million
dollars.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:51.357
So that developers were given
the license to basically do what

00:18:51.357 --> 00:18:54.190
they wanted on the barrier
islands.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:58.037
And if you look further north
along the Florida coastline,

00:18:58.037 --> 00:19:01.884
you see that the majority of
Florida's coastline has these

00:19:01.884 --> 00:19:03.640
barrier islands on it.
 

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:09.480
So I was going to take you on a
flight over this.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.394
I don't know if any of you have
played with the flight simulator

00:19:12.394 --> 00:19:12.950
on Google.
 

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:15.874
But I decided against doing
that in the lecture because I

00:19:15.874 --> 00:19:18.747
end up spending more time
underwater with the plane than

00:19:18.747 --> 00:19:19.740
on the surface.
 

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:24.890
But here you can see the
barriers, variable in intensity.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:30.145
But Miami Beach is probably the
most intensely developed barrier

00:19:30.145 --> 00:19:33.400
island in the U.S.,
if not the world.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.119
So I'll pause and back out of
this and head back to the

00:19:37.119 --> 00:19:37.808
lecture.
 

00:19:37.808 --> 00:19:43.250
And also, the development in
California, in the southern part

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:47.148
of the state,
is some of the most rapid that

00:19:47.148 --> 00:19:48.509
we've seen.
 

00:19:48.509 --> 00:19:52.818
Although the recent housing
crisis has slowed that.

00:19:52.818 --> 00:19:57.134
Now, I want you to think also a
bit about technological

00:19:57.134 --> 00:20:00.009
solutions, because there are
many.

00:20:00.009 --> 00:20:03.058
Many engineering solutions to
protect against loss of life.

00:20:03.058 --> 00:20:06.666
And following a very intense
storm where tens of thousands of

00:20:06.666 --> 00:20:10.455
people lost their life in Great
Britain and also the Netherlands

00:20:10.455 --> 00:20:14.107
back in the early 1950s,
a project was initiated called

00:20:14.107 --> 00:20:15.190
the Delta Works.
 

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:20.180
And the Delta Works basically
built sea walls and dikes that

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:24.240
those in the Netherlands are
quite famous for.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.808
And they're very effective.
 

00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:28.519
So here's the largest sea wall
in the world.

00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:32.500
It's triggered,
it closes automatically when

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:37.130
the sea level rises up a certain
number of feet.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:41.224
And here's the Thames barrier,
designed to protect London

00:20:41.224 --> 00:20:44.588
against flooding from severe
storms as well.

00:20:44.588 --> 00:20:47.366
So that there are a variety of
different technological

00:20:47.366 --> 00:20:49.828
solutions that are
extraordinarily expensive.

00:20:49.828 --> 00:20:53.569
But given the property value
that exists and is at risk in

00:20:53.569 --> 00:20:56.587
the coastal zone,
these are likely to be in our

00:20:56.587 --> 00:20:57.769
future in U.S.
 

00:20:57.769 --> 00:20:59.548
urban areas.
 

00:20:59.548 --> 00:21:02.630
And think for a moment about
Hurricane Katrina.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:07.017
Again, the low bound projection
of the cost is roughly,

00:21:07.017 --> 00:21:11.078
cost of loss to the public,
200 billion dollars.

00:21:11.078 --> 00:21:14.098
The high bound is closer to a
half of a trillion dollars.

00:21:14.098 --> 00:21:19.811
And part of the loss was
associated with the failure of

00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:20.868
the U.S.
 

00:21:20.868 --> 00:21:25.477
Corps of Engineers to make a
decision that would raise the

00:21:25.477 --> 00:21:30.407
level of the dike that would be
protective for a category five

00:21:30.407 --> 00:21:31.538
hurricane.
 

00:21:31.538 --> 00:21:34.982
They decided,
when they were choosing among

00:21:34.982 --> 00:21:38.588
different structural design
alternatives,

00:21:38.588 --> 00:21:42.018
they decided that they would
build a sea wall that would be

00:21:42.018 --> 00:21:45.210
protective only for a category
three to four storm,

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:48.333
the reason being that they had
the authority to make that

00:21:48.333 --> 00:21:50.900
decision by balancing costs
versus benefits.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.538
So they reduced everything to
cost versus benefit,

00:21:53.538 --> 00:21:57.355
and they basically concluded
that the probability of a

00:21:57.355 --> 00:22:00.237
category five,
a worst-case scenario,

00:22:00.237 --> 00:22:01.970
was exceptionally low.
 

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:06.142
Here's an example of that dike
breaking through and the school

00:22:06.142 --> 00:22:08.808
bus on the bottom being flooded
over.

00:22:08.808 --> 00:22:13.888
Now, a different approach to
this, rather than using high

00:22:13.888 --> 00:22:19.421
tech solutions that are really
expensive, was being pursued by

00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:20.509
the U.S.
 

00:22:20.509 --> 00:22:25.146
back in the 1960s and '70s,
a legal strategy that evolved

00:22:25.146 --> 00:22:30.280
in Congress to create a variety
of new national parks that were

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.180
then called national seashores.
 

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.784
So Cape Cod,
for example,

00:22:34.784 --> 00:22:38.930
was one of the first national
seashores after Cape Hatteras.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:43.108
And so that you can imagine
there were these private lands.

00:22:43.108 --> 00:22:45.509
And the government was trying
to figure out,

00:22:45.509 --> 00:22:49.236
well, how can effectively
create a new national park in an

00:22:49.236 --> 00:22:53.028
area of private land or an area
that may be private land or

00:22:53.028 --> 00:22:55.200
county land,
state lands?

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.588
So there's really a complex
mixture of different public and

00:22:59.588 --> 00:23:03.751
private ownership pattern,
but no federal presence prior

00:23:03.751 --> 00:23:05.190
to 1961 to '63.
 

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:08.608
So the Park Service was given
the authority by Congress.

00:23:08.608 --> 00:23:13.476
This is John F. Kennedy,
who signed the statue and his

00:23:13.476 --> 00:23:19.170
family being famous for their
home in Hyannis on Cape Cod.

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:22.577
The family has been very
protective of land use and

00:23:22.577 --> 00:23:24.348
development on Cape Cod.
 

00:23:24.348 --> 00:23:28.805
And conservation groups have
long thought that this was an

00:23:28.805 --> 00:23:31.618
area worthy of federal
protection.

00:23:31.618 --> 00:23:34.478
So that the Park Service was
given the money and the

00:23:34.478 --> 00:23:37.952
authority by Congress to go in
and buy up the land on Cape Cod,

00:23:37.952 --> 00:23:39.970
or part of the land on Cape
Cod.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.750
And they decided to do that in
a very interesting way.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:46.730
They decided to exclude areas
such as the village centers,

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:50.851
whereas they would buy up the
coastal areas that offered A)

00:23:50.851 --> 00:23:53.410
the most recreational
opportunity.

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.678
Interestingly,
they also had the highest

00:23:55.678 --> 00:23:58.179
property value,
so that they were in a sense

00:23:58.179 --> 00:23:59.750
the most controversial.
 

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:03.507
So recreational opportunity,
maintaining the possibility of

00:24:03.507 --> 00:24:07.265
public access to the beach,
which in New England and in the

00:24:07.265 --> 00:24:09.078
eastern part of the U.S.
 

00:24:09.078 --> 00:24:10.720
is extremely difficult to get
to.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.316
So if you try to get to the
beach in coastal communities

00:24:14.316 --> 00:24:17.050
here in Connecticut,
you often have a hard time

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.412
getting there,
because you've got house after

00:24:19.412 --> 00:24:22.519
house after house,
and you've got fences put up.

00:24:22.519 --> 00:24:25.396
So that even though the State
of Connecticut has adopted its

00:24:25.396 --> 00:24:27.250
own law that demands public
access,

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:31.028
this is no way close to the
ethic and culture of public

00:24:31.028 --> 00:24:33.618
access that evolved in
California,

00:24:33.618 --> 00:24:37.009
as well as in Oregon and in
parts of Washington.

00:24:37.009 --> 00:24:40.855
So that different parts of the
country have these different

00:24:40.855 --> 00:24:44.170
cultural predispositions to
allow public access.

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:48.941
So one way to think about this
problem is to think about which

00:24:48.941 --> 00:24:53.400
private lands does the Park
Service really want to own?

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.689
Do they really want to buy up
somebody's house or do they want

00:24:56.689 --> 00:24:58.900
to buy up a commercial shopping
center?

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.990
Or do they want airports inside
the park or outside the park?

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:05.825
So there are many difficult
decisions that have to be made

00:25:05.825 --> 00:25:08.710
if you decide that you're going
to use the power of eminent

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:11.595
domain to go in and create a new
national seashore or a new

00:25:11.595 --> 00:25:12.588
national park.
 

00:25:12.588 --> 00:25:16.720
So this was all occurring,
by the way, in an era when

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.692
climate change concern was
pretty much nonexistent,

00:25:20.692 --> 00:25:22.440
back in the 1960s.
 

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:27.396
But it actually was quite
farsighted as a legal strategy

00:25:27.396 --> 00:25:33.076
that we might learn lessons from
today about how we could manage

00:25:33.076 --> 00:25:35.509
other areas in the U.S.
 

00:25:35.509 --> 00:25:38.019
that are relatively undeveloped.
 

00:25:38.019 --> 00:25:40.748
And if you look also at the
ecological characteristics of

00:25:40.748 --> 00:25:43.565
the coastline here,
you can see the same kind of

00:25:43.565 --> 00:25:47.175
barrier spit,
but in the natural form that

00:25:47.175 --> 00:25:50.730
existed down in Miami,
at Miami Beach,

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:54.009
before that was intensively
developed.

00:25:54.009 --> 00:25:59.122
Obviously, the density is much,
much lower here than Miami

00:25:59.122 --> 00:25:59.838
Beach.
 

00:25:59.838 --> 00:26:03.198
But it gives you a sense of
what an ecosystem like this

00:26:03.198 --> 00:26:06.368
would look like in a relatively
undisturbed form.

00:26:06.368 --> 00:26:10.422
So that the national seashore
now extends all the way to the

00:26:10.422 --> 00:26:13.992
tip of Cape Cod up to
Provincetown and includes about

00:26:13.992 --> 00:26:17.839
six communities with the most
intensively developed areas

00:26:17.839 --> 00:26:19.420
excluded from it.
 

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:24.690
Now the Cape Cod formula for
land protection was curious,

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:28.767
because it gave the government
the power to use eminent domain

00:26:28.767 --> 00:26:31.240
to go in and take private
property.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.839
And eminent domain means that
they would be compensated for

00:26:34.839 --> 00:26:36.019
their value loss.
 

00:26:36.019 --> 00:26:39.261
And it was kind of curious,
because many property owners

00:26:39.261 --> 00:26:42.546
realized that boy,
now that people understood that

00:26:42.546 --> 00:26:45.650
the Park Service was buying up
private lands,

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:48.368
property values were going
through the roof.

00:26:48.368 --> 00:26:52.364
So whenever anybody wants to
preserve land and they have to

00:26:52.364 --> 00:26:56.846
buy up a number of parcels,
then it really pays the last

00:26:56.846 --> 00:27:00.263
holdout,
because property value is going

00:27:00.263 --> 00:27:01.500
to be highest.
 

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.990
And also, these rates of
property value increase were

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.098
occurring at about fifty percent
per year.

00:27:06.098 --> 00:27:10.740
So many people took the Park
Service to court and said,

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.130
"No, we're not going to
give you our land,"

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:15.200
even though compensation was
being offered.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.528
So what they did was,
they were playing a game,

00:27:18.528 --> 00:27:22.214
watching property values
increase, knowing that the

00:27:22.214 --> 00:27:26.785
market value that they would be
provided for the property would

00:27:26.785 --> 00:27:31.058
be decided once the court had
made its final decision.

00:27:31.058 --> 00:27:34.054
So eight, ten years later,
if they could draw the

00:27:34.054 --> 00:27:37.433
litigation out over a decade,
when you have a fifty percent

00:27:37.433 --> 00:27:40.556
increase per year,
that caused the Park Service

00:27:40.556 --> 00:27:45.200
great anxiety and made them
increase their offer to settle.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.198
But it was a much more
expensive venture that took a

00:27:49.198 --> 00:27:51.548
lot more time to accomplish.
 

00:27:51.548 --> 00:27:54.470
The Nature Conservancy has used
a similar kind of strategy,

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:57.568
but rather than going into an
area such as the Virginia

00:27:57.568 --> 00:28:00.340
Coastal Reserve,
rather than going into the area

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:02.625
and telling people,
we're going to create a new

00:28:02.625 --> 00:28:04.108
Nature Conservancy Preserve
here,

00:28:04.108 --> 00:28:07.634
instead, they set up a variety,
a large number of separate

00:28:07.634 --> 00:28:11.037
dummy corporations that went in
and purchased the tracts

00:28:11.037 --> 00:28:14.563
independently so that nobody
really had a sense that there

00:28:14.563 --> 00:28:18.273
was one group coming in and they
were basically creating this

00:28:18.273 --> 00:28:19.450
collective.
 

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:23.833
And that whole strategy was
designed to prevent people from

00:28:23.833 --> 00:28:26.041
delaying,
from holding out,

00:28:26.041 --> 00:28:29.872
and trying to secure the
benefit that the increased

00:28:29.872 --> 00:28:33.088
property value over time would
provide.

00:28:33.088 --> 00:28:37.284
So thinking also about the
dynamics of this environment and

00:28:37.284 --> 00:28:41.404
why it's different than an
upland area, say in central New

00:28:41.404 --> 00:28:43.720
York or central Connecticut.
 

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:48.750
The energy that is pushing
against a barrier such as Miami

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:53.869
Beach or Assateague Island is
coming predominantly from two

00:28:53.869 --> 00:28:54.930
sources.
 

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:56.578
One is wind and one is waves.
 

00:28:56.578 --> 00:29:00.372
Actually, the sand shifts
around more in response to wind

00:29:00.372 --> 00:29:03.420
because prevailing winds push
the sand up,

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:07.520
and the central stabilizing
force of a barrier island is

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.278
nothing more than a blade of
grass.

00:29:10.278 --> 00:29:13.890
And on Cape Cod,
as just one example,

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:16.858
the kind of sea grass that they
have,

00:29:16.858 --> 00:29:22.291
the dune grass that they have,
it often grows up maybe a meter

00:29:22.291 --> 00:29:24.917
in height,
but it also sends roots down

00:29:24.917 --> 00:29:26.230
about a meter in height.
 

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:29.680
So that it can withstand a lot
of over wash by storm waves.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.166
At the same time,
it plays a function of building

00:29:32.166 --> 00:29:35.222
up these dunes,
because it just reduces the

00:29:35.222 --> 00:29:40.256
wind velocity in the vicinity of
the grass blades down to a level

00:29:40.256 --> 00:29:42.615
--
I think I recall that it's

00:29:42.615 --> 00:29:45.618
seventeen miles an hour,
on Cape Cod.

00:29:45.618 --> 00:29:49.013
So the grains of sand are
blowing across the beach and

00:29:49.013 --> 00:29:51.640
they hit the sea grass and they
settle.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:57.660
The dune then builds itself up
under natural conditions.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:01.753
Under conditions where people
are trampling the sea grass or

00:30:01.753 --> 00:30:06.056
off road vehicles are trampling
the sea grass or developers are

00:30:06.056 --> 00:30:10.753
building on the dunes,
you have a much more rapid rate

00:30:10.753 --> 00:30:14.400
of dune loss and increased
instability.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.548
This house is no longer in
place.

00:30:16.548 --> 00:30:21.693
This house has fallen over the
cliff in response to a storm

00:30:21.693 --> 00:30:26.750
that kept chipping away at the
base of this large dune.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:31.028
And many barrier islands also
have a phenomena where they have

00:30:31.028 --> 00:30:34.955
a freshwater lens of ground
water that sits on top of the

00:30:34.955 --> 00:30:38.220
underlying sea water,
which is denser.

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:41.529
So that most people on barrier
islands as well as on Cape Cod,

00:30:41.529 --> 00:30:46.546
get their water supply from
this groundwater lens that is

00:30:46.546 --> 00:30:50.130
extremely vulnerable to
contamination.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:51.769
And why would that be?
 

00:30:51.769 --> 00:30:54.308
Because it's just basically a
huge sand pile.

00:30:54.308 --> 00:30:57.112
So anything that is deposited
on the surface can easily

00:30:57.112 --> 00:30:58.670
migrate beneath the surface.
 

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:01.471
So in Cape Cod,
they've now done a storm

00:31:01.471 --> 00:31:04.659
vulnerability analysis,
which they've done throughout

00:31:04.659 --> 00:31:07.328
the United States,
and tried to figure out what

00:31:07.328 --> 00:31:09.088
the best response might be.
 

00:31:09.088 --> 00:31:12.278
In some areas,
the Park Service tried to use

00:31:12.278 --> 00:31:15.718
riprap,
which are big blocks of stone

00:31:15.718 --> 00:31:21.301
that they put against the edge
between the beach and the sand

00:31:21.301 --> 00:31:22.140
dunes.
 

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.130
And they found that that was
not a good idea,

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:27.832
because hurricanes and
Northeasters could pick up those

00:31:27.832 --> 00:31:32.151
stones and basically chew right
through the barrier island using

00:31:32.151 --> 00:31:33.180
the stones.
 

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:37.460
The waves push the stones right
through the sand.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:42.853
So many people have started
building their houses on stilts

00:31:42.853 --> 00:31:48.153
or refitting stilts and the
underlying infrastructure that

00:31:48.153 --> 00:31:50.848
would be more survivable.
 

00:31:50.848 --> 00:31:56.009
And many don't also understand
that during periods of intense

00:31:56.009 --> 00:32:00.912
storms that these barrier
islands want to basically be cut

00:32:00.912 --> 00:32:05.038
into segments so that they get
over washed,

00:32:05.038 --> 00:32:07.058
and then as the bays behind
them fill up,

00:32:07.058 --> 00:32:11.140
the tide goes down,
the water shoots out of the bay

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.608
and cuts across.
 

00:32:12.608 --> 00:32:15.636
Here's a good example of a
house on Cape Cod that was built

00:32:15.636 --> 00:32:16.420
on a barrier.
 

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.191
And the individual,
when he found that his house

00:32:19.191 --> 00:32:21.608
was floating in the middle of
the bay,

00:32:21.608 --> 00:32:26.444
he got his boat out and he went
out and put a chain through his

00:32:26.444 --> 00:32:31.670
door and his window and dragged
the house back to the shoreline,

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:35.180
hired a crane operator to come
in and pick the house up,

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:38.873
put it on a tractor-trailer,
and dragged back out and put it

00:32:38.873 --> 00:32:41.440
back exactly where it was on the
beach.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.558
And the U.S.
 

00:32:42.558 --> 00:32:44.663
federal government,
through the flood insurance

00:32:44.663 --> 00:32:46.308
program, paid for the entire
cost.

00:32:46.308 --> 00:32:51.175
So here's another good example
of the dynamic character of a

00:32:51.175 --> 00:32:56.125
barrier, where the sands are
literally blowing through an oak

00:32:56.125 --> 00:32:58.269
forest up on Cape Cod.
 

00:32:58.269 --> 00:33:02.877
So that a natural condition is
a rare condition for a barrier

00:33:02.877 --> 00:33:07.717
and the estuary that it harbors
in the United States now because

00:33:07.717 --> 00:33:12.326
of the intensity of development
and the incentive that people

00:33:12.326 --> 00:33:17.010
have had to try to make money by
investing in property in this

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:18.009
area.
 

00:33:18.009 --> 00:33:20.992
Fire Island National Seashore,
by the way, is only about

00:33:20.992 --> 00:33:23.380
thirty-five miles to the south
of us here.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:26.986
And it's a pretty good example
of-- portions of it are a good

00:33:26.986 --> 00:33:28.788
example of a barrier island.
 

00:33:28.788 --> 00:33:30.981
And in 1963,
two years after the Cape Cod

00:33:30.981 --> 00:33:33.942
National Seashore was created,
the Fire Island National

00:33:33.942 --> 00:33:36.410
Seashore and Wilderness Area was
created.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:39.906
So I bet you didn't know that
you were within thirty-five

00:33:39.906 --> 00:33:43.029
miles of a federally-designated
Wilderness Area.

00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:45.358
Now, if you live in a coastal
area,

00:33:45.358 --> 00:33:50.323
one way of securing your own
protection is to try to capture

00:33:50.323 --> 00:33:52.626
the sediment,
the sand that's moving along

00:33:52.626 --> 00:33:53.140
the coastline.
 

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:57.315
So people, you can imagine that
this coastline was straight and

00:33:57.315 --> 00:34:00.884
you imagine that the first
property owner in this case

00:34:00.884 --> 00:34:03.967
decided,
you know, my beach is eroding,

00:34:03.967 --> 00:34:08.382
and supposing that this was the
area that he was particularly

00:34:08.382 --> 00:34:09.780
concerned about.
 

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.628
My beach is eroding,
I'm going to build a jetty that

00:34:12.628 --> 00:34:16.036
will actually capture that sand
as it's being pushed along the

00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:17.599
shoreline, which he did.
 

00:34:17.599 --> 00:34:19.719
Well, if you're going to
capture sand in one area,

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:21.969
you're going to create a
deficit in the next area.

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:26.170
So that that is the phenomena,
this accretion and deficit

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:30.445
effect of building a jetty
explains why you have everybody

00:34:30.445 --> 00:34:33.070
basically doing the same thing.
 

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:38.143
And I was flying over the
Connecticut shoreline last

00:34:38.143 --> 00:34:39.139
weekend.
 

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:43.485
And you can see these jetties
side by side all along the New

00:34:43.485 --> 00:34:47.389
Haven, the Milford,
East Haven, Branford shoreline.

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:48.820
Very interesting phenomenon.
 

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.599
But very expensive to maintain.
 

00:34:50.599 --> 00:34:52.360
To build and to maintain.
 

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.929
And here's another example of
how to capture sand.

00:34:55.929 --> 00:35:01.128
That's the Massachusetts Beach
Buggy Association that is

00:35:01.128 --> 00:35:07.179
planning sprigs of sea grass in
an effort to rebuild the dune.

00:35:07.179 --> 00:35:08.389
And it actually works.
 

00:35:08.389 --> 00:35:12.606
By planting these sprigs of
grass, they can cause a dune

00:35:12.606 --> 00:35:17.590
system to become restored within
a matter of a couple of years.

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:21.780
So the Cape Cod formula was
also applied to Fire Island.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.998
And one key element of this
legal strategy was that if

00:35:24.998 --> 00:35:28.277
governments at the local level
did not adopt the zoning

00:35:28.277 --> 00:35:31.617
restrictions that the Park
Service wanted for those more

00:35:31.617 --> 00:35:35.244
developed communities,
then the federal government had

00:35:35.244 --> 00:35:38.675
the authority to use eminent
domain to go in and just take

00:35:38.675 --> 00:35:39.699
over the land.
 

00:35:39.699 --> 00:35:42.719
So it was a carrot and a stick
idea in a way.

00:35:42.719 --> 00:35:47.154
If the local government did not
adopt the standards to protect

00:35:47.154 --> 00:35:50.789
the ecological values of these
barrier islands,

00:35:50.789 --> 00:35:53.318
then the federal government
would go in and use eminent

00:35:53.318 --> 00:35:53.739
domain.
 

00:35:53.739 --> 00:35:56.190
Interesting kind of
combination, is Fire Island.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:58.797
Looking down Fire Island,
parts of it are rather

00:35:58.797 --> 00:36:00.018
intensely developed.
 

00:36:00.018 --> 00:36:02.996
Quarter acre houses,
sometimes tenth of an acre

00:36:02.996 --> 00:36:03.579
houses.
 

00:36:03.579 --> 00:36:07.630
And the underlying aquifer in
this case was polluted,

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:11.916
requiring them to drill much
deeper wells to provide the

00:36:11.916 --> 00:36:14.018
community water supply.
 

00:36:14.018 --> 00:36:17.170
I'm going to scoot ahead here,
another example.

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:22.646
Here is an example of a bunch
of fairly expensive houses

00:36:22.646 --> 00:36:26.429
sitting on the shore of Fire
Island.

00:36:26.429 --> 00:36:30.099
And because these are extremely
vulnerable to storms,

00:36:30.099 --> 00:36:35.346
it's very common for this first
row sitting right on the beach

00:36:35.346 --> 00:36:37.757
to be wiped out,
to be flooded out,

00:36:37.757 --> 00:36:41.108
which is kind of interesting,
because it causes an instant

00:36:41.108 --> 00:36:45.416
shift in property value on a
barrier when the first line gets

00:36:45.416 --> 00:36:46.349
wiped out.
 

00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:52.050
So here's another shot of an
area nearby, when you can see

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:58.050
the former house locations
marked out by these boundaries.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:01.380
So that all of a sudden,
these become shorefront and

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:04.449
accrue a terrific increase in
property value.

00:37:04.449 --> 00:37:08.436
Another example of a property
rights mixture on Fire Island is

00:37:08.436 --> 00:37:12.688
the Point O' Woods Association,
where the land is owned by a

00:37:12.688 --> 00:37:14.855
collective,
a corporation,

00:37:14.855 --> 00:37:20.105
that then leases out the right
to take over one of the houses

00:37:20.105 --> 00:37:24.480
in the community for a specific
period of time.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.409
Could be fifty years,
might be seventy-five years.

00:37:26.409 --> 00:37:29.393
And these lease rights are
often passed on down among

00:37:29.393 --> 00:37:30.369
family members.
 

00:37:30.369 --> 00:37:33.563
So that this has been an
effective strategy in this case

00:37:33.563 --> 00:37:36.989
to protect the common space,
the open land in the middle.

00:37:36.989 --> 00:37:40.460
By the way, you see also an
example here of basically

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:44.530
creating a seawall on the bay
side that would offer protection

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:47.199
for the houses that were built
here.

00:37:47.199 --> 00:37:50.434
But to do that,
they basically had to dredge

00:37:50.434 --> 00:37:54.949
out the material here and dump
it on other marshland in order

00:37:54.949 --> 00:37:57.960
to create this developable
property.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:02.322
Another example on Fire Island,
if you look at the little dot

00:38:02.322 --> 00:38:05.960
up there at the end,
the Fire Island Lighthouse.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.360
It was funny,
I flew right over this the

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.099
other day.
 

00:38:09.099 --> 00:38:13.452
The Fire Island Lighthouse was
built right on the end of this

00:38:13.452 --> 00:38:13.960
spit.
 

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:17.632
And you can see,
back in 1834 that it was close

00:38:17.632 --> 00:38:18.670
to the end.
 

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:24.250
By 1909, the spit had extended
several hundred yards.

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:30.050
And today, the spit is almost
four or four and a half miles

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:32.449
beyond the lighthouse.
 

00:38:32.449 --> 00:38:36.103
So that not only do these
barrier islands want to roll

00:38:36.103 --> 00:38:39.952
toward the mainland,
but they also want to extend

00:38:39.952 --> 00:38:44.639
themselves in the same direction
of the prevailing flow,

00:38:44.639 --> 00:38:46.409
prevailing currents.
 

00:38:46.409 --> 00:38:50.929
Another couple of examples of
pre- and post-storm.

00:38:50.929 --> 00:38:55.639
This was Hurricane Rita.
 

00:38:55.639 --> 00:38:59.980
And some of these were taken
down on the Texas coastline,

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.840
the Padre Island area.
 

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:06.003
Padre Island is an interesting
additional example of a national

00:39:06.003 --> 00:39:09.224
seashore,
so that keep your eye in this

00:39:09.224 --> 00:39:13.389
case on the structure which is
right about there.

00:39:13.389 --> 00:39:17.409
So this is pre-storm and this
is post-storm.

00:39:17.409 --> 00:39:22.349
Another example of high-rise
buildings.

00:39:22.349 --> 00:39:25.840
And again, think about this.
 

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.612
High-rise building sitting on
top of a big sand pile,

00:39:29.612 --> 00:39:33.750
structurally rather unstable,
pre-storm and post-storm.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:37.722
And in this case,
you can see in the background,

00:39:37.722 --> 00:39:42.878
there's almost no damage to the
properties that are on the bay

00:39:42.878 --> 00:39:45.500
side of the barrier island.
 

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:53.869
Another example,
pre-storm and post-storm.

00:39:53.869 --> 00:40:01.699
Pre-storm and post-storm.
 

00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:03.090
This case is interesting.
 

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:07.822
Here's a shorefront owner who
was surprised to find that he

00:40:07.822 --> 00:40:09.699
was now a corner lot.
 

00:40:09.699 --> 00:40:13.692
So that this is a terrific
example of the way that a

00:40:13.692 --> 00:40:18.030
barrier can get over washed,
and then the tidal flux causes

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:21.659
the water inside the channel
just to saw back and forth.

00:40:21.659 --> 00:40:24.456
And this occurred,
interestingly,

00:40:24.456 --> 00:40:28.039
on Nauset Beach in Chatham in
Cape Cod.

00:40:28.039 --> 00:40:33.012
So that one of these little
inlets was created by a storm,

00:40:33.012 --> 00:40:34.409
a northeaster.
 

00:40:34.409 --> 00:40:38.086
And the sawing action of the
tides and the currents in

00:40:38.086 --> 00:40:42.181
additional storms caused the
inlet to expand to be more than

00:40:42.181 --> 00:40:43.570
a mile in width.
 

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:48.295
And the bay front that lay
behind it suddenly became

00:40:48.295 --> 00:40:49.500
oceanfront.
 

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:54.065
And the new oceanfront
landowners were really upset,

00:40:54.065 --> 00:40:59.170
because they now faced
increasing risk of storm damage.

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:03.289
So they went to the State of
Massachusetts and they also went

00:41:03.289 --> 00:41:05.900
to the Corps of Engineers and
said,

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.094
"You know,
you've got to step in and

00:41:07.094 --> 00:41:08.170
you've got to offer us
protection.

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:10.260
We're too vulnerable.
 

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:11.710
Our property's vulnerable to
loss."

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:14.429
And it caused,
now that they were no longer a

00:41:14.429 --> 00:41:16.780
bay front but they were
oceanfront,

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.811
their shorefront was eroding
away and their property was

00:41:19.811 --> 00:41:20.860
being threatened.
 

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:24.085
The Corps of Engineers and the
State of Massachusetts said,

00:41:24.085 --> 00:41:25.420
"No, we're sorry.
 

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:29.380
This is a natural process that
we are not going to step in to

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:30.570
intervene."
 

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:32.250
So the U.S.
 

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:35.353
government has stopped building
these seawalls and stopped

00:41:35.353 --> 00:41:38.402
building these jetties to
capture sand to protect private

00:41:38.402 --> 00:41:39.219
ownerships.
 

00:41:39.219 --> 00:41:42.192
Very interesting outcome that
has attracted a lot of

00:41:42.192 --> 00:41:42.949
litigation.
 

00:41:42.949 --> 00:41:47.559
Pre-storm and post-storm.
 

00:41:47.559 --> 00:41:51.829
So I'm going to have to shoot
ahead here.

00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:55.317
Let me close by just saying
that the central questions that

00:41:55.317 --> 00:41:58.744
one would ask about the best way
to manage property in the

00:41:58.744 --> 00:42:00.610
coastal zone include these.
 

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:04.074
Should the land be held in
public ownership or private

00:42:04.074 --> 00:42:04.860
ownership?
 

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.092
If the land is currently in
private ownership,

00:42:08.092 --> 00:42:11.469
how should it be taken into
public ownership?

00:42:11.469 --> 00:42:15.920
Should the land be regulated?
 

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:19.873
That's a much cheaper solution
than going in and buying up the

00:42:19.873 --> 00:42:23.699
land and using the power of
eminent domain or purchasing the

00:42:23.699 --> 00:42:25.710
land from a willing seller.
 

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:28.018
How should we structure our
insurance programs?

00:42:28.018 --> 00:42:32.202
How are we going to manage the
tension that exists between the

00:42:32.202 --> 00:42:36.041
high property value in the
coastal zone that provides the

00:42:36.041 --> 00:42:40.360
fuel to developers to want to go
in and develop intensively that

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.829
creates this public liability?
 

00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:47.820
What is the requirement to
provide compensation when

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:53.498
regulation is being used to
protect one public good or many

00:42:53.498 --> 00:42:56.746
public goods,
access to recreational

00:42:56.746 --> 00:42:59.409
opportunities,
the important nursery

00:42:59.409 --> 00:43:02.570
characteristic for commercial
fisheries,

00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:06.670
the ecological value of an
estuary to store floodwaters so

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:10.483
that if an estuary is filled up
then it just means the

00:43:10.483 --> 00:43:14.010
floodwaters are going to move
someplace else.

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:16.001
So that there are clear
benefits associated with

00:43:16.001 --> 00:43:17.909
regulating development of the
coastal zone.

00:43:17.909 --> 00:43:20.309
So that if you set those
regulations up,

00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:24.632
should you also have to
compensate the private landowner

00:43:24.632 --> 00:43:29.349
if he claims or she claims that
their property value has been

00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:30.530
diminished?
 

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:34.358
So that these are the kind of
conflicting and competing values

00:43:34.358 --> 00:43:36.429
that exist in the coastal zone.
 

00:43:36.429 --> 00:43:38.679
Okay.
 

00:43:38.679 --> 00:43:39.579
That's it for today.
 

00:43:39.579 --> 00:43:40.510
Have a great weekend.
 

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:41.449
Enjoy the weather.
 

00:43:41.449 --> 00:43:47.000

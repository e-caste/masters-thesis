00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.726
Professor Ben Polak: So
this is Game Theory Economics

00:00:04.726 --> 00:00:06.512
159.
If you're here for art history,

00:00:06.512 --> 00:00:08.817
you're either in the wrong room
or stay anyway,

00:00:08.817 --> 00:00:12.810
maybe this is the right room;
but this is Game Theory, okay.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.278
You should have four handouts;
everyone should have four

00:00:16.278 --> 00:00:18.258
handouts.
There is a legal release

00:00:18.258 --> 00:00:21.870
form--we'll talk about it in a
minute--about the videoing.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.686
There is a syllabus,
which is a preliminary

00:00:23.686 --> 00:00:27.785
syllabus: it's also online.
And there are two games labeled

00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:31.332
Game 1 and Game 2.
Can I get you all to look at

00:00:31.332 --> 00:00:33.650
Game 1 and start thinking about
it.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.252
And while you're thinking about
it, I am hoping you can

00:00:36.252 --> 00:00:38.430
multitask a bit.
I'll describe a bit about the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.780
class and we'll get a bit of
admin under our belts.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.055
But please try and look
at--somebody's not looking at

00:00:43.055 --> 00:00:45.681
it, because they're using it as
a fan here--so look at Game 1

00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:49.270
and fill out that form for me,
okay?

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.716
So while you're filling that
out, let me tell you a little

00:00:51.716 --> 00:00:53.690
bit about what we're going to be
doing here.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.513
So what is Game Theory?
Game Theory is a method of

00:00:57.513 --> 00:01:02.020
studying strategic situations.
So what's a strategic situation?

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.696
Well let's start off with
what's not a strategic

00:01:04.696 --> 00:01:06.804
situation.
In your Economics - in your

00:01:06.804 --> 00:01:09.971
Intro Economics class in 115 or
110, you saw some pretty good

00:01:09.971 --> 00:01:12.610
examples of situations that were
not strategic.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.209
You saw firms working in
perfect competition.

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.681
Firms in perfect competition
are price takers:

00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:22.141
they don't particularly have to
worry about the actions of their

00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:24.106
competitors.
You also saw firms that were

00:01:24.106 --> 00:01:26.278
monopolists and monopolists
don't have any competitors to

00:01:26.278 --> 00:01:28.218
worry about, so that's not a
particularly strategic

00:01:28.218 --> 00:01:30.674
situation.
They're not price takers but

00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:33.904
they take the demand curve.
Is this looking familiar for

00:01:33.904 --> 00:01:36.807
some of you who can remember
doing 115 last year or maybe two

00:01:36.807 --> 00:01:39.869
years ago for some of you?
Everything in between is

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.398
strategic.
So everything that constitutes

00:01:42.398 --> 00:01:45.110
imperfect competition is a
strategic setting.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.379
Think about the motor industry,
the motor car industry.

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:50.665
Ford has to worry about what GM
is doing and what Toyota is

00:01:50.665 --> 00:01:54.063
doing, and for the moment at
least what Chrysler is doing but

00:01:54.063 --> 00:01:57.049
perhaps not for long.
So there's a small number of

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.459
firms and their actions affect
each other.

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.705
So for a literal definition of
what strategic means:

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:06.205
it's a setting where the
outcomes that affect you depend

00:02:06.205 --> 00:02:09.532
on actions,
not just on your own actions,

00:02:09.532 --> 00:02:12.605
but on actions of others.
All right, that's as much as

00:02:12.605 --> 00:02:14.563
I'm going to say for preview
right now, we're going to come

00:02:14.563 --> 00:02:16.860
back and see plenty of this over
the course of the next semester.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.669
So what I want to do is get on
to where this applies.

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:22.545
It obviously applies in
Economics, but it also applies

00:02:22.545 --> 00:02:25.265
in politics, and in fact,
this class will count as a

00:02:25.265 --> 00:02:27.775
Political Science class if
you're a Political Science

00:02:27.775 --> 00:02:30.159
major.
You should go check with the

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:34.186
DUS in Political Science.
It count - Game Theory is very

00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:37.586
important in law these days.
So for those of you--for the

00:02:37.586 --> 00:02:39.874
half of you--that are going to
end up in law school,

00:02:39.874 --> 00:02:42.680
this is pretty good training.
Game Theory is also used in

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.726
biology and towards the middle
of the semester we're actually

00:02:45.726 --> 00:02:48.468
going to see some examples of
Game Theory as applied to

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:51.725
evolution.
And not surprisingly,

00:02:51.725 --> 00:02:57.154
Game Theory applies to sport.
So let's talk about a bit of

00:02:57.154 --> 00:02:58.428
admin.
How are you doing on filling

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.637
out those games?
Everyone managing to multitask:

00:03:00.637 --> 00:03:03.110
filling in Game 1?
Keep writing.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.479
I want to get some admin out of
the way and I want to start by

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.770
getting out of the way what is
obviously the elephant in the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.039
room.
Some of you will have noticed

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:12.620
that there's a camera crew here,
okay.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.446
So as some of you probably
know, Yale is undergoing an open

00:03:17.446 --> 00:03:22.189
education project and they're
videoing several classes,

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.004
and the idea of this,
is to make educational

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:28.080
materials available beyond the
walls of Yale.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.066
In fact, on the web,
internationally,

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:32.659
so people in places,
maybe places in the U.S.

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.928
or places miles away,
maybe in Timbuktu or whatever,

00:03:35.928 --> 00:03:39.645
who find it difficult to get
educational materials from the

00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:44.395
local university or whatever,
can watch certain lectures from

00:03:44.395 --> 00:03:47.055
Yale on the web.
Some of you would have been in

00:03:47.055 --> 00:03:49.917
classes that do that before.
What's going to different about

00:03:49.917 --> 00:03:53.129
this class is that you're going
to be participating in it.

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.127
The way we teach this class is
we're going to play games,

00:03:55.127 --> 00:03:56.340
we're going to have
discussions,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.472
we're going to talk among the
class, and you're going to be

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:03.000
learning from each other,
and I want you to help people

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
watching at home to be able to
learn too.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.621
And that means you're going to
be on film, at the very least on

00:04:09.621 --> 00:04:11.400
mike.
So how's that going to work?

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.919
Around the room are three T.A.s
holding mikes.

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.420
Let me show you where they are:
one here, one here,

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.893
and one here.
When I ask for classroom

00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:24.274
discussions, I'm going to have
one of the T.A.s go to you with

00:04:24.274 --> 00:04:27.721
a microphone much like in
"Donahue" or something,

00:04:27.721 --> 00:04:29.188
okay.
At certain times,

00:04:29.188 --> 00:04:31.699
you're going to be seen on
film, so the camera is actually

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.990
going to come around and point
in your direction.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.170
Now I really want this to
happen.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.164
I had to argue for this to
happen, cause I really feel that

00:04:38.164 --> 00:04:40.802
this class isn't about me.
I'm part of the class

00:04:40.802 --> 00:04:43.754
obviously, but it's about you
teaching each other and

00:04:43.754 --> 00:04:45.706
participating.
But there's a catch,

00:04:45.706 --> 00:04:47.680
the catch is,
that that means you have to

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.255
sign that legal release form.
So you'll see that you have in

00:04:50.255 --> 00:04:52.114
front of you a legal release
form, you have to be able to

00:04:52.114 --> 00:04:54.164
sign it,
and what that says is that we

00:04:54.164 --> 00:04:56.139
can use you being shown in
class.

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.660
Think of this as a bad hair day
release form.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.569
All right, you can't sue Yale
later if you had a bad hair day.

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.209
For those of you who are on the
run from the FBI,

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:09.069
your Visa has run out,
or you're sitting next to your

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:12.124
ex-girlfriend,
now would be a good time to put

00:05:12.124 --> 00:05:15.655
a paper bag over your head.
All right, now just to get you

00:05:15.655 --> 00:05:18.208
used to the idea,
in every class we're going to

00:05:18.208 --> 00:05:20.817
have I think the same two
people, so Jude is the

00:05:20.817 --> 00:05:24.254
cameraman;
why don't you all wave to Jude:

00:05:24.254 --> 00:05:27.600
this is Jude okay.
And Wes is our audio guy:

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.865
this is Wes.
And I will try and remember not

00:05:29.865 --> 00:05:32.138
to include Jude and Wes in the
classroom discussions,

00:05:32.138 --> 00:05:34.149
but you should be aware that
they're there.

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:36.083
Now, if this is making you
nervous, if it's any

00:05:36.083 --> 00:05:37.889
consolation, it's making me very
nervous.

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.265
So, all right,
we'll try and make this class

00:05:40.265 --> 00:05:43.579
work as smoothly as we can,
allowing for this extra thing.

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:45.489
Let me just say,
no one's making any money off

00:05:45.489 --> 00:05:48.119
this--at least I'm hoping these
guys are being paid--but me and

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:50.428
the T.A.s are not being paid.
The aim of this,

00:05:50.428 --> 00:05:53.551
that I think is a good aim,
it's an educational project,

00:05:53.551 --> 00:05:55.879
and I'm hoping you'll help us
with it.

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:58.328
The one difference it is going
to mean, is that at times I

00:05:58.328 --> 00:06:00.519
might hold some of the
discussions for the class,

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:04.163
coming down into this part of
the room, here,

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:07.310
to make it a little easier for
Jude.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.029
All right, how are we doing now
on filling out those forms?

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:13.340
Has everyone filled in their
strategy for the first game?

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.315
Not yet.
Okay, let's go on doing a bit

00:06:16.315 --> 00:06:18.582
more admin.
The thing you mostly care about

00:06:18.582 --> 00:06:19.810
I'm guessing,
is the grades.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.279
All right, so how is the grade
going to work for this class?

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:25.235
30% of the class will be on
problem sets,

00:06:25.235 --> 00:06:28.225
30% of the grade;
30% on the mid-term,

00:06:28.225 --> 00:06:31.529
and 40% on the final;
so 30/30/40.

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:36.500
The mid-term will be held in
class on October 17^(th);

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.552
that is also in your syllabus.
Please don't anybody tell me

00:06:39.552 --> 00:06:42.751
late - any time after today you
didn't know when the mid-term

00:06:42.751 --> 00:06:45.790
was and therefore it clashes
with 17 different things.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.336
The mid-term is on October
17^(th), which is a Wednesday,

00:06:50.336 --> 00:06:53.036
in class.
All right, the problem sets:

00:06:53.036 --> 00:06:56.715
there will be roughly ten
problem sets and I'll talk about

00:06:56.715 --> 00:06:59.490
them more later on when I hand
them out.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.040
The first one will go out on
Monday but it will be due ten

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.220
days later.
Roughly speaking they'll be

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.887
every week.
The grade distribution:

00:07:06.887 --> 00:07:09.279
all right, so this is the rough
grade distribution.

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:11.764
Roughly speaking,
a sixth of the class are going

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:14.195
to end up with A's,
a sixth are going to end up

00:07:14.195 --> 00:07:15.976
with A-,
a sixth are going to end up

00:07:15.976 --> 00:07:17.803
with B+, a sixth are going to
end up with B,

00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:19.459
a sixth are going to end up
with B-,

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:21.691
and the remaining sixth,
if I added that up right,

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:24.332
are going to end up with what I
guess we're now calling the

00:07:24.332 --> 00:07:27.800
presidential grade,
is that right?

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.092
That's not literally true.
I'm going to squeeze it a bit,

00:07:31.092 --> 00:07:34.323
I'm going to curve it a bit,
so actually slightly fewer than

00:07:34.323 --> 00:07:38.293
a sixth will get straight A's,
and fewer than a sixth will get

00:07:38.293 --> 00:07:40.916
C's and below.
We'll squeeze the middle to

00:07:40.916 --> 00:07:44.189
make them be more B's.
One thing I can guarantee from

00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:47.982
past experience in this class,
is that the median grade will

00:07:47.982 --> 00:07:51.369
be a B+.
The median will fall somewhere

00:07:51.369 --> 00:07:54.056
in the B+'s.
Just as forewarning for people

00:07:54.056 --> 00:07:57.260
who have forgotten what a median
is, that means half of you--not

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.110
approximately half,
it means exactly half of

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:04.507
you--will be getting something
like B+ and below and half will

00:08:04.507 --> 00:08:07.758
get something like B+ and above.
Now, how are you doing in

00:08:07.758 --> 00:08:09.889
filling in the forms?
Everyone filled them in yet?

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:12.209
Surely must be pretty close to
getting everyone filled in.

00:08:12.209 --> 00:08:15.836
All right, so last things to
talk about before I actually

00:08:15.836 --> 00:08:19.331
collect them in - textbooks.
There are textbooks for this

00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:21.708
class.
The main textbook is this one,

00:08:21.708 --> 00:08:24.360
Dutta's book Strategy and
Games.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.186
If you want a slightly tougher
book, more rigorous book,

00:08:28.186 --> 00:08:30.759
try Joel Watson's book,
Strategies.

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:33.600
Both of those books are
available at the bookstore.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.995
But I want to warn everybody
ahead of time,

00:08:35.995 --> 00:08:38.220
I will not be following the
textbook.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.830
I regard these books as safety
nets.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.057
If you don't understand
something that happened in

00:08:43.057 --> 00:08:45.830
class, you want to reinforce an
idea that came up in class,

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.142
then you should read the
relevant chapters in the book

00:08:48.142 --> 00:08:50.803
and the syllabus will tell you
which chapters to read for each

00:08:50.803 --> 00:08:52.420
class,
or for each week of class,

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.819
all right.
But I will not be following

00:08:54.819 --> 00:08:58.516
these books religiously at all.
In fact, they're just there as

00:08:58.516 --> 00:08:59.861
back up.
In addition,

00:08:59.861 --> 00:09:03.204
I strongly recommend people
read, Thinking

00:09:03.204 --> 00:09:06.500
Strategically.
This is good bedtime reading.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.980
Do any of you suffer from
insomnia?

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.159
It's very good bedtime reading
if you suffer from insomnia.

00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:14.848
It's a good book and what's
more there's going to be a new

00:09:14.848 --> 00:09:17.631
edition of this book this year
and Norton have allowed us to

00:09:17.631 --> 00:09:20.699
get advance copies of it.
So if you don't buy this book

00:09:20.699 --> 00:09:24.156
this week, I may be able to make
the advance copy of the new

00:09:24.156 --> 00:09:26.909
edition available for some of
you next week.

00:09:26.909 --> 00:09:29.405
I'm not taking a cut on that
either, all right,

00:09:29.405 --> 00:09:31.250
there's no money changing
hands.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.252
All right, sections are on the
syllabus sign up - sorry on the

00:09:34.252 --> 00:09:36.622
website, sign up as usual.
Put yourself down on the wait

00:09:36.622 --> 00:09:38.299
list if you don't get into the
section you want.

00:09:38.299 --> 00:09:40.437
You probably will get into the
section you want once we're

00:09:40.437 --> 00:09:41.560
done.
All right, now we must be done

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.440
with the forms.
Are we done with the forms?

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.665
All right, so why don't we send
the T.A.s, with or without

00:09:46.665 --> 00:09:50.060
mikes, up and down the aisles
and collect in your Game #1;

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.640
not Game #2, just Game #1.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.715
Just while we're doing that,
I think the reputation of this

00:10:08.715 --> 00:10:11.629
class--I think--if you look at
the course evaluations online or

00:10:11.629 --> 00:10:14.137
whatever,
is that this class is

00:10:14.137 --> 00:10:17.389
reasonably hard but reasonably
fun.

00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:20.620
So I'm hoping that's what the
reputation of the class is.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.719
If you think this class is
going to be easy,

00:10:22.719 --> 00:10:24.769
I think it isn't actually an
easy class.

00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:27.231
It's actually quite a hard
class, but I think I can

00:10:27.231 --> 00:10:29.250
guarantee it's going to be a fun
class.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.365
Now one reason it's a fun
class, is the nice thing about

00:10:32.365 --> 00:10:35.594
teaching Game Theory - quieten
down folks--one thing about

00:10:35.594 --> 00:10:38.219
teaching Game Theory is,
you get to play games,

00:10:38.219 --> 00:10:40.629
and that's exactly what we've
just been doing now.

00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:46.160
This is our first game and
we're going to play games

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.908
throughout the course,
sometimes several times a week,

00:10:51.908 --> 00:10:56.240
sometimes just once a week.
We got all these things in?

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:08.700
Everyone handed them in?
So I need to get those counted.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.470
Has anyone taken the Yale
Accounting class?

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.082
No one wants to - has
aspirations to be - one person

00:11:15.082 --> 00:11:15.970
has.
I'll have a T.A.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.383
do it, it's all right,
we'll have a T.A.

00:11:17.383 --> 00:11:19.950
do it.
So Kaj, can you count those for

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.169
me?
Is that right?

00:11:23.169 --> 00:11:25.740
Let me read out the game you've
just played.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.820
"Game 1, a simple grade scheme
for the class.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.007
Read the following carefully.
Without showing your neighbor

00:11:32.007 --> 00:11:34.993
what you are doing,
put it in the box below either

00:11:34.993 --> 00:11:37.370
the letter Alpha or the letter
Beta.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:42.230
Think of this as a grade bid.
I will randomly pair your form

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:46.255
with another form and neither
you nor your pair will ever know

00:11:46.255 --> 00:11:49.645
with whom you were paired.
Here's how the grades may be

00:11:49.645 --> 00:11:52.139
assigned for the class.
[Well they won't be,

00:11:52.139 --> 00:11:55.028
but we can pretend.]
If you put Alpha and you're

00:11:55.028 --> 00:11:57.979
paired with Beta,
then you will get an A and your

00:11:57.979 --> 00:12:00.455
pair a C.
If you and your pair both put

00:12:00.455 --> 00:12:03.292
Alpha, you'll both get B-.
If you put Beta and you're

00:12:03.292 --> 00:12:05.803
paired with Alpha,
you'll get a C and your pair an

00:12:05.803 --> 00:12:08.042
A.
If you and your pair both put

00:12:08.042 --> 00:12:11.364
Beta, then you'll both get B+."
So that's the thing you just

00:12:11.364 --> 00:12:13.517
filled in.
Now before we talk about this,

00:12:13.517 --> 00:12:16.421
let's just collect this
information in a more useful

00:12:16.421 --> 00:12:21.547
way.
So I'm going to remove this for

00:12:21.547 --> 00:12:25.353
now.
We'll discuss this in a second,

00:12:25.353 --> 00:12:30.163
but why don't we actually
record what the game is,

00:12:30.163 --> 00:12:33.009
that we're playing,
first.

00:12:33.009 --> 00:12:36.494
So this is our grade game,
and what I'm going to do,

00:12:36.494 --> 00:12:40.388
since it's kind of hard to
absorb all the information just

00:12:40.388 --> 00:12:44.465
by reading a paragraph of text,
I'm going to make a table to

00:12:44.465 --> 00:12:47.712
record the information.
So what I'm going to do is I'm

00:12:47.712 --> 00:12:49.695
going to put me here,
and my pair,

00:12:49.695 --> 00:12:52.340
the person I'm randomly paired
with here,

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.617
and Alpha and Beta,
which are the choices I'm going

00:12:55.617 --> 00:12:58.830
to make here and on the columns
Alpha and Beta,

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:02.659
the choices my pair is making.
In this table,

00:13:02.659 --> 00:13:09.230
I'm going to put my grades.
So my grade if we both put

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:13.610
Alpha is B-, if we both put
Beta, was B+.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:17.298
If I put Alpha and she put a
Beta, I got an A,

00:13:17.298 --> 00:13:21.560
and if I put Beta and she put
an Alpha, I got a C.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.080
Is that correct?
That's more or less right?

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:29.586
Yeah, okay while we're here,
why don't we do the same for my

00:13:29.586 --> 00:13:33.888
pair?
So this is my grades on the

00:13:33.888 --> 00:13:39.969
left hand table,
but now let's look at what my

00:13:39.969 --> 00:13:45.240
pair will do,
what my pair will get.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.534
So I should warn the people
sitting at the back that my

00:13:47.534 --> 00:13:49.830
handwriting is pretty bad,
that's one reason for moving

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.584
forward.
The other thing I should

00:13:51.584 --> 00:13:54.230
apologize at this stage of the
class is my accent.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:58.848
I will try and improve the
handwriting, there's not much I

00:13:58.848 --> 00:14:02.090
can do about the accent at this
stage.

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:05.570
So once again if you both put
Alpha then my pair gets a B-.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.860
If we both put Beta,
then we both get a B+;

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.639
in particular,
my pair gets a B+.

00:14:09.639 --> 00:14:14.950
If I put Alpha and my pair puts
Beta, then she gets a C.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:19.210
And if I put Beta and she puts
Alpha, then she gets an A.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:22.176
So I now have all the
information that was on the

00:14:22.176 --> 00:14:24.710
sheet of paper that you just
handed in.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:27.206
Now there's another way of
organizing this that's standard

00:14:27.206 --> 00:14:29.133
in Game Theory,
so we may as well get used to

00:14:29.133 --> 00:14:31.874
it now on the first day.
Rather then drawing two

00:14:31.874 --> 00:14:35.431
different tables like this,
what I'm going to do is I'm

00:14:35.431 --> 00:14:39.316
going to take the second table
and super-impose it on top of

00:14:39.316 --> 00:14:42.055
the first table.
Okay, so let me do that and

00:14:42.055 --> 00:14:45.476
you'll see what I mean.
What I'm going to do is draw a

00:14:45.476 --> 00:14:48.283
larger table,
the same basic structure:

00:14:48.283 --> 00:14:51.460
I'm choosing Alpha and Beta on
the rows,

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:55.606
my pair is choosing Alpha and
Beta on the columns,

00:14:55.606 --> 00:14:59.159
but now I'm going to put both
grades in.

00:14:59.159 --> 00:15:04.863
So the easy ones are on the
diagonal: you both get B- if we

00:15:04.863 --> 00:15:09.639
both choose Alpha;
we both get B+ if we both

00:15:09.639 --> 00:15:13.852
choose Beta.
But if I choose Alpha and my

00:15:13.852 --> 00:15:18.570
pair chooses Beta,
I get an A and she gets a C.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.929
And if I choose Beta and she
chooses Alpha,

00:15:21.929 --> 00:15:26.570
then it's me who gets the C and
it's her who gets the A.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.791
So notice what I did here.
The first grade corresponds to

00:15:29.791 --> 00:15:31.880
the row player,
me in this case,

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.721
and the second grade in each
box corresponds to the column

00:15:35.721 --> 00:15:38.230
player,
my pair in this case.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.818
So this is a nice succinct way
of recording what was in the

00:15:41.818 --> 00:15:44.389
previous two tables.
This is an outcome matrix;

00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:53.730
this tells us everything that
was in the game.

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:57.011
Okay, so now seems a good time
to start talking about what

00:15:57.011 --> 00:15:59.535
people did.
So let's just have a show of

00:15:59.535 --> 00:16:04.360
hands.
How many of you chose Alpha?

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.023
Leave your hands up so that
Jude can catch that,

00:16:07.023 --> 00:16:08.950
so people can see at home,
okay.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.529
All right and how many of you
chose Beta?

00:16:12.529 --> 00:16:16.049
There's far more Alphas - wave
your hands the Beta's okay.

00:16:16.049 --> 00:16:17.649
All right, there's a Beta here,
okay.

00:16:17.649 --> 00:16:19.451
So it looks like a lot of -
well we're going to find out,

00:16:19.451 --> 00:16:21.350
we're going to count--but a lot
more Alpha's than Beta's.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.070
Let me try and find out some
reasons why people chose.

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:27.460
So let me have the Alpha's up
again.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:32.278
So, the woman who's in red
here, can we get a mike to the -

00:16:32.278 --> 00:16:36.562
yeah, is it okay if we ask you?
You're not on the run from the

00:16:36.562 --> 00:16:37.730
FBI?
We can ask you why?

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.379
Okay, so you chose Alpha right?
So why did you choose Alpha?

00:16:40.379 --> 00:16:45.967
Student: [inaudible]
realized that my partner chose

00:16:45.967 --> 00:16:49.789
Alpha, therefore I chose
[inaudible].

00:16:49.789 --> 00:16:51.926
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so you wrote out these

00:16:51.926 --> 00:16:53.884
squares, you realized what your
partner was going to do,

00:16:53.884 --> 00:16:56.349
and responded to that.
Any other reasons for choosing

00:16:56.349 --> 00:17:00.529
Alpha around the room?
Can we get the woman here?

00:17:00.529 --> 00:17:02.727
Try not to be intimidated by
these microphones,

00:17:02.727 --> 00:17:05.009
they're just mikes.
It's okay.

00:17:05.009 --> 00:17:08.558
Student: The reason I
chose Alpha, regardless of what

00:17:08.558 --> 00:17:11.325
my partner chose,
I think there would be better

00:17:11.325 --> 00:17:14.308
outcomes than choosing Beta.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:17:14.308 --> 00:17:16.460
right, so let me ask your names
for a second-so your name was?

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.127
Student: Courtney.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:17:18.127 --> 00:17:19.200
Courtney and your name was?
Student: Clara Elise.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:19.990
Professor Ben Polak:
Clara Elise.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.829
So slightly different reasons,
same choice Alpha.

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:25.920
Clara Elise's reason - what did
Clara Elise say?

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.343
She said, no matter what the
other person does,

00:17:28.343 --> 00:17:31.400
she reckons she'd get a better
grade if she chose Alpha.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.396
So hold that thought a second,
we'll come back to - is it

00:17:33.396 --> 00:17:35.336
Clara Elise, is that right?
We'll come back to Clara Elise

00:17:35.336 --> 00:17:36.762
in a second.
Let's talk to the Beta's a

00:17:36.762 --> 00:17:38.488
second;
let me just emphasize at this

00:17:38.488 --> 00:17:40.140
stage there are no wrong
answers.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.990
Later on in the class there'll
be some questions that have

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.824
wrong answers.
Right now there's no wrong

00:17:43.824 --> 00:17:45.202
answers.
There may be bad reasons but

00:17:45.202 --> 00:17:47.219
there's no wrong answers.
So let's have the Beta's up

00:17:47.219 --> 00:17:49.880
again.
Let's see the Beta's.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.930
Oh come on!
There was a Beta right here.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:56.009
You were a Beta right?
You backed off the Beta, okay.

00:17:56.009 --> 00:17:57.329
So how can I get a mike into a
Beta?

00:17:57.329 --> 00:17:58.690
Let' s stick in this aisle a
bit.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:01.580
Is that a Beta right there?
Are you a Beta right there?

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.500
Can I get the Beta in here?
Who was the Beta in here?

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.109
Can we get the mike in there?
Is that possible?

00:18:07.109 --> 00:18:09.380
In here - you can leave your
hand so that - there we go.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.216
Just point towards - that's
fine, just speak into it,

00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:13.721
that's fine.
Student: So the reason

00:18:13.721 --> 00:18:14.647
right?
Professor Ben Polak:

00:18:14.647 --> 00:18:16.394
Yeah, go ahead.
Student: I personally

00:18:16.394 --> 00:18:18.910
don't like swings that much and
it's the B-/B+ range,

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.989
so I'd much rather prefer that
to a swing from A to C,

00:18:22.989 --> 00:18:25.879
and that's my reason.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:18:25.879 --> 00:18:27.650
right, so you're saying it
compresses the range.

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:29.299
I'm not sure it does compress
the range.

00:18:29.299 --> 00:18:34.329
I mean if you chose Alpha,
you're swinging from A to B-;

00:18:34.329 --> 00:18:37.519
and from Beta,
swinging from B+ to C.

00:18:37.519 --> 00:18:40.580
I mean those are similar kind
of ranges but it certainly is a

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.670
reason.
Other reasons for choosing?

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.280
Yeah, the guy in blue here,
yep, good.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.589
That's all right.
Don't hold the mike;

00:18:48.589 --> 00:18:49.859
just let it point at you,
that's fine.

00:18:49.859 --> 00:18:53.055
Student: Well I guess I
thought we could be more

00:18:53.055 --> 00:18:56.310
collusive and kind of work
together, but I guess not.

00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:00.036
So I chose Beta.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:19:00.036 --> 00:19:01.255
There's a siren in the
background so I missed the

00:19:01.255 --> 00:19:02.125
answer.
Stand up a second,

00:19:02.125 --> 00:19:03.569
so we can just hear you.
Student: Sure.

00:19:03.569 --> 00:19:04.780
Professor Ben Polak:
Sorry, say again.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:05.920
Student: Sure.
My name is Travis.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.980
I thought we could work
together, but I guess not.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.690
Professor Ben Polak: All
right good.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.109
That's a pretty good reason.
Student: If you had

00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:14.900
chosen Beta we would have all
gotten B+'s but I guess not.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.809
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, so Travis is giving us a

00:19:16.809 --> 00:19:17.680
different reason,
right?

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.217
He's saying that maybe,
some of you in the room might

00:19:21.217 --> 00:19:24.549
actually care about each other's
grades, right?

00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:26.020
I mean you all know each other
in class.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.392
You all go to the same college.
For example,

00:19:28.392 --> 00:19:32.900
if we played this game up in
the business school--are there

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.140
any MBA students here today?
One or two.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.894
If we play this game up in the
business school,

00:19:37.894 --> 00:19:40.183
I think it's quite likely we're
going to get a lot of Alpha's

00:19:40.183 --> 00:19:42.947
chosen, right?
But if we played this game up

00:19:42.947 --> 00:19:46.529
in let's say the Divinity
School, all right and I'm

00:19:46.529 --> 00:19:50.757
guessing that Travis' answer is
reflecting what you guys are

00:19:50.757 --> 00:19:53.397
reasoning here.
If you played in the Divinity

00:19:53.397 --> 00:19:55.770
School, you might think that
people in the Divinity School

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.809
might care about other people's
grades, right?

00:19:57.809 --> 00:20:00.040
There might be ethical
reasons--perfectly good,

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.950
sensible, ethical reasons--for
choosing Beta in this game.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.435
There might be other reasons as
well, but that's perhaps the

00:20:05.435 --> 00:20:07.003
reason to focus on.
And perhaps,

00:20:07.003 --> 00:20:10.362
the lesson I want to draw out
of this is that right now this

00:20:10.362 --> 00:20:12.594
is not a game.
Right now we have actions,

00:20:12.594 --> 00:20:15.465
strategies for people to take,
and we know what the outcomes

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:18.530
are, but we're missing something
that will make this a game.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:21.259
What are we missing here?
Student: Objectives.

00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:22.150
Professor Ben Polak:
We're missing objectives.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:25.052
We're missing payoffs.
We're missing what people care

00:20:25.052 --> 00:20:27.157
about, all right.
So we can't really start

00:20:27.157 --> 00:20:29.669
analyzing a game until we know
what people care about,

00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:31.660
and until we know what the
payoffs are.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.436
Now let's just say something
now, which I'll probably forget

00:20:34.436 --> 00:20:36.978
to say in any other moment of
the class, but today it's

00:20:36.978 --> 00:20:38.785
relevant.
Game Theory,

00:20:38.785 --> 00:20:43.567
me, professors at Yale,
cannot tell you what your

00:20:43.567 --> 00:20:47.373
payoff should be.
I can't tell you in a useful

00:20:47.373 --> 00:20:51.390
way what it is that your goals
in life should be or whatever.

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:53.190
That's not what Game Theory is
about.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:57.358
However, once we know what your
payoffs are, once we know what

00:20:57.358 --> 00:21:00.228
your goals are,
perhaps Game Theory can you

00:21:00.228 --> 00:21:03.038
help you get there.
So we've had two different

00:21:03.038 --> 00:21:06.149
kinds of payoffs mentioned here.
We had the kind of payoff where

00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:08.931
we care about our own grade,
and Travis has mentioned the

00:21:08.931 --> 00:21:11.663
kind of payoff where you might
care about other people's

00:21:11.663 --> 00:21:14.254
grades.
And what we're going to do

00:21:14.254 --> 00:21:19.009
today is analyze this game under
both those possible payoffs.

00:21:19.009 --> 00:21:26.555
To start that off,
let's put up some possible

00:21:26.555 --> 00:21:31.599
payoffs for the game.
And I promise we'll come back

00:21:31.599 --> 00:21:33.039
and look at some other payoffs
later.

00:21:33.039 --> 00:21:38.680
We'll revisit the Divinity
School later.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:44.076
All right, so here once again
is our same matrix with me and

00:21:44.076 --> 00:21:49.381
my pair, choosing actions Alpha
and Beta, but this time I'm

00:21:49.381 --> 00:21:54.104
going to put numbers in here.
And some of you will perhaps

00:21:54.104 --> 00:21:57.390
recognize these numbers,
but that's not really relevant

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:59.195
for now.
All right, so what's the idea

00:21:59.195 --> 00:22:01.680
here?
Well the first idea is that

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.430
these numbers represent utiles
or utilities.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:09.549
They represent what these
people are trying to maximize,

00:22:09.549 --> 00:22:12.470
what they're to achieve,
their goals.

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:17.391
The idea is - just to compare
this to the outcome matrix - for

00:22:17.391 --> 00:22:23.050
the person who's me here,
(A,C) yields a payoff of--(A,C)

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:28.440
is this box--so (A,C) yields a
payoff of three,

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:39.230
whereas (B-,B-) yields a payoff
of 0, and so on.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:42.318
So what's the interpretation?
It's the first interpretation:

00:22:42.318 --> 00:22:44.879
the natural interpretation that
a lot of you jumped to straight

00:22:44.879 --> 00:22:46.884
away.
These are people--people with

00:22:46.884 --> 00:22:50.002
these payoffs are people--who
only care about their own

00:22:50.002 --> 00:22:52.611
grades.
They prefer an A to a B+,

00:22:52.611 --> 00:22:57.079
they prefer a B+ to a B-,
and they prefer a B- to a C.

00:22:57.079 --> 00:23:00.015
Right, I'm hoping I the grades
in order, otherwise it's going

00:23:00.015 --> 00:23:02.069
to ruin my curve at the end of
the year.

00:23:02.069 --> 00:23:08.140
So these people only care about
their own grades.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:16.880
They only care about their own
grades.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.900
What do we call people who only
care about their own grades?

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.450
What's a good technical term
for them?

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:28.853
In England, I think we refer to
these guys - whether it's

00:23:28.853 --> 00:23:32.970
technical or not - as "evil
gits."

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:37.680
These are not perhaps the most
moral people in the universe.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.509
So now we can ask a different
question.

00:23:39.509 --> 00:23:42.273
Suppose, whether these are
actually your payoffs or not,

00:23:42.273 --> 00:23:44.670
pretend they are for now.
Suppose these are all payoffs.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.149
Now we can ask,
not what did you do,

00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:49.925
but what should you do?
Now we have payoffs that can

00:23:49.925 --> 00:23:51.720
really switch the question to a
normative question:

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.504
what should you do?
Let's come back to - was it

00:23:54.504 --> 00:23:57.680
Clara Elise--where was Clara
Elise before?

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.830
Let's get the mike on you again.
So just explain what you did

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:02.663
and why again.
Student: Why I chose

00:24:02.663 --> 00:24:03.390
Alpha?
Professor Ben Polak:

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:04.150
Yeah, stand up a second,
if that's okay.

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:06.672
Student: Okay.
Professor Ben Polak: You

00:24:06.672 --> 00:24:08.098
chose Alpha;
I'm assuming these were roughly

00:24:08.098 --> 00:24:08.994
your payoffs,
more or less,

00:24:08.994 --> 00:24:10.269
you were caring about your
grades.

00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:11.438
Student: Yeah,
I was thinking - Professor

00:24:11.438 --> 00:24:12.420
Ben Polak: Why did you
choose Alpha?

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.944
Student: I'm sorry?
Professor Ben Polak: Why

00:24:13.944 --> 00:24:15.506
did you choose Alpha?
Just repeat what you said

00:24:15.506 --> 00:24:17.216
before.
Student: Because I

00:24:17.216 --> 00:24:20.348
thought the payoffs - the two
different payoffs that I could

00:24:20.348 --> 00:24:22.789
have gotten--were highest if I
chose Alpha.

00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:23.890
Professor Ben Polak:
Good;

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:26.075
so what Clara Elise is
saying--it's an important

00:24:26.075 --> 00:24:28.912
idea--is this (and tell me if
I'm paraphrasing you incorrectly

00:24:28.912 --> 00:24:31.330
but I think this is more or less
what you're saying):

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:33.470
is no matter what the other
person does,

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:37.848
no matter what the pair does,
she obtains a higher payoff by

00:24:37.848 --> 00:24:40.150
choosing Alpha.
Let's just see that.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:44.719
If the pair chooses Alpha and
she chooses Alpha,

00:24:44.719 --> 00:24:48.549
then she gets 0.
If the pair chooses Alpha and

00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:50.630
she chose Beta,
she gets -1.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:55.808
0 is bigger than -1.
If the pair chooses Beta,

00:24:55.808 --> 00:24:59.217
then if she chooses Alpha she
gets 3, Beta she gets 1,

00:24:59.217 --> 00:25:01.970
and 3 is bigger than 1.
So in both cases,

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.655
no matter what the other person
does, she receives a higher

00:25:05.655 --> 00:25:09.339
payoff from choosing Alpha,
so she should choose Alpha.

00:25:09.339 --> 00:25:11.660
Does everyone follow that line
of reasoning?

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.284
That's a stronger line of
reasoning then the reasoning we

00:25:14.284 --> 00:25:15.606
had earlier.
So the woman,

00:25:15.606 --> 00:25:18.581
I have immediately forgotten
the name of, in the red shirt,

00:25:18.581 --> 00:25:20.890
whose name was -
Student: Courtney.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:21.830
Professor Ben Polak:
Courtney,

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.190
so Courtney also gave a reason
for choosing Alpha,

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:24.979
and it was a perfectly good
reason for choosing Alpha,

00:25:24.979 --> 00:25:27.314
nothing wrong with it,
but notice that this reason's a

00:25:27.314 --> 00:25:31.380
stronger reason.
It kind of implies your reason.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:35.440
So let's get some definitions
down here.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.769
I think I can fit it in here.
Let's try and fit it in here.

00:25:39.769 --> 00:25:56.251
Definition: We say that my
strategy Alpha strictly

00:25:56.251 --> 00:26:11.511
dominates my strategy Beta,
if my payoff from Alpha is

00:26:11.511 --> 00:26:24.112
strictly greater than that from
Beta, [and this is the key

00:26:24.112 --> 00:26:39.650
part of the definition],
regardless of what others

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:44.440
do.
Shall we just read that back?

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:48.453
"We say that my strategy Alpha
strictly dominates my strategy

00:26:48.453 --> 00:26:52.667
Beta, if my payoff from Alpha is
strictly greater than that from

00:26:52.667 --> 00:26:55.490
Beta,
regardless of what others do."

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:59.255
Now it's by no means my main
aim in this class to teach you

00:26:59.255 --> 00:27:01.067
jargon.
But a few bits of jargon are

00:27:01.067 --> 00:27:03.828
going to be helpful in allowing
the conversation to move forward

00:27:03.828 --> 00:27:08.512
and this is certainly one.
"Evil gits" is maybe one too,

00:27:08.512 --> 00:27:12.585
but this is certainly one.
Let's draw out some lessons

00:27:12.585 --> 00:27:15.558
from this.
Actually, so you can still read

00:27:15.558 --> 00:27:19.430
that, let me bring down and
clean this board.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:24.108
So the first lesson of the
class, and there are going to be

00:27:24.108 --> 00:27:28.194
lots of lessons,
is a lesson that emerges

00:27:28.194 --> 00:27:35.111
immediately from the definition
of a dominated strategy and it's

00:27:35.111 --> 00:27:44.482
this.
So Lesson One of the course is:

00:27:44.482 --> 00:27:58.180
do not play a strictly
dominated strategy.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:02.193
So with apologies to Strunk and
White, this is in the passive

00:28:02.193 --> 00:28:04.869
form, that's dominated,
passive voice.

00:28:04.869 --> 00:28:10.060
Do not play a strictly
dominated strategy.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:15.090
Why?
Somebody want to tell me why?

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:20.910
Do you want to get this guy?
Stand up - yeah.

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:23.594
Student: Because
everyone's going to pick the

00:28:23.594 --> 00:28:26.331
dominant outcome and then
everyone's going to get the

00:28:26.331 --> 00:28:28.910
worst result - the collectively
worst result.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:30.259
Professor Ben Polak:
Yeah, that's a possible answer.

00:28:30.259 --> 00:28:31.970
I'm looking for something more
direct here.

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:34.650
So we look at the definition of
a strictly dominated strategy.

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:37.529
I'm saying never play one.
What's a possible reason for

00:28:37.529 --> 00:28:40.104
that?
Let's - can we get the woman

00:28:40.104 --> 00:28:41.520
there?
Student: [inaudible]

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.039
Professor Ben Polak:
"You'll always lose."

00:28:43.039 --> 00:28:45.056
Well, I don't know:
it's not about winning and

00:28:45.056 --> 00:28:46.230
losing.
What else could we have?

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:50.589
Could we get this guy in the
pink down here?

00:28:50.589 --> 00:28:51.980
Student: Well,
the payoffs are lower.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.178
Professor Ben Polak: The
payoffs are lower,

00:28:53.178 --> 00:28:55.103
okay.
So here's an abbreviated

00:28:55.103 --> 00:28:58.317
version of that,
I mean it's perhaps a little

00:28:58.317 --> 00:29:01.752
bit longer.
The reason I don't want to play

00:29:01.752 --> 00:29:05.177
a strictly dominated strategy
is, if instead,

00:29:05.177 --> 00:29:08.057
I play the strategy that
dominates it,

00:29:08.057 --> 00:29:11.971
I do better in every case.
The reason I never want to play

00:29:11.971 --> 00:29:14.586
a strictly dominated strategy
is, if instead I play the

00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:18.403
strategy that dominates it,
whatever anyone else does I'm

00:29:18.403 --> 00:29:21.420
doing better than I would have
done.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.160
Now that's a pretty convincing
argument.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.819
That sounds like a convincing
argument.

00:29:24.819 --> 00:29:29.354
It sounds like too obvious even
to be worth stating in class,

00:29:29.354 --> 00:29:33.738
so let me now try and shake
your faith a little bit in this

00:29:33.738 --> 00:29:36.660
answer.
You're somebody who's wanted by

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:41.495
the FBI, right?
Okay, so how about the

00:29:41.495 --> 00:29:46.736
following argument?
Look at the payoff matrix again

00:29:46.736 --> 00:29:51.059
and suppose I reason as follows.
Suppose I reason and say if we,

00:29:51.059 --> 00:29:54.590
me and my pair,
both reason this way and choose

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:58.489
Alpha then we'll both get 0.
But if we both reasoned a

00:29:58.489 --> 00:30:01.710
different way and chose Beta,
then we'll both get 1.

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:04.498
So I should choose Beta:
1 is bigger than 0,

00:30:04.498 --> 00:30:08.809
I should choose Beta.
What's wrong with that argument?

00:30:08.809 --> 00:30:10.361
My argument must be wrong
because it goes against the

00:30:10.361 --> 00:30:12.091
lesson of the class and the
lessons of the class are gospel

00:30:12.091 --> 00:30:13.536
right,
they're not wrong ever,

00:30:13.536 --> 00:30:15.330
so what's wrong with that
argument?

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:21.547
Yes, Ale - yeah good.
Student: Well because

00:30:21.547 --> 00:30:23.598
you have to be able to agree,
you have to be able to speak to

00:30:23.598 --> 00:30:25.819
them but we aren't allowed to
show our partners what we wrote.

00:30:25.819 --> 00:30:29.006
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so it involves some

00:30:29.006 --> 00:30:31.311
notion of agreeing.
So certainly part of the

00:30:31.311 --> 00:30:33.340
problem here,
with the reasoning I just gave

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.839
you--the reasoning that said I
should choose Beta,

00:30:35.839 --> 00:30:39.014
because if we both reason the
same way, we both do better that

00:30:39.014 --> 00:30:41.460
way--involves some kind of
magical reasoning.

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.988
It's as if I'm arguing that if
I reason this way and reason

00:30:44.988 --> 00:30:48.178
myself to choosing Beta,
somehow I'm going to make the

00:30:48.178 --> 00:30:50.230
rest of you reason the same way
too.

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:53.924
It's like I've got ESP or I'm
some character out of the X-Men,

00:30:53.924 --> 00:30:56.519
is that what it's called?
The X-Men right?

00:30:56.519 --> 00:30:58.381
Now in fact,
this may come as a surprise to

00:30:58.381 --> 00:31:00.686
you, I don't have ESP,
I'm not a character out of the

00:31:00.686 --> 00:31:02.577
X-Men,
and so you can't actually see

00:31:02.577 --> 00:31:05.472
brain waves emitting from my
head, and my reasoning doesn't

00:31:05.472 --> 00:31:08.493
affect your reasoning.
So if I did reason that way,

00:31:08.493 --> 00:31:11.216
and chose Beta,
I'm not going to affect your

00:31:11.216 --> 00:31:14.189
choice one way or the other.
That's the first thing that's

00:31:14.189 --> 00:31:16.422
wrong with that reasoning.
What else is wrong with that

00:31:16.422 --> 00:31:20.359
reasoning?
Yeah, that guy down here.

00:31:20.359 --> 00:31:22.228
Student: Well,
the second that you choose Beta

00:31:22.228 --> 00:31:24.421
then someone's going - it's in
someone's best interest to take

00:31:24.421 --> 00:31:25.952
advantage of it.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:31:25.952 --> 00:31:27.289
right, so someone's going to
take advantage of me,

00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:29.226
but even more than that,
an even stronger argument:

00:31:29.226 --> 00:31:30.930
that's true,
but even a stronger argument.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.380
Well how about this?
Even if I was that guy in the

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.749
X-Men or the Matrix or whatever
it was, who could reason his way

00:31:36.749 --> 00:31:40.495
into making people do things.
Even if I could make everyone

00:31:40.495 --> 00:31:44.285
in the room choose Beta by the
force of my brain waves,

00:31:44.285 --> 00:31:46.849
what should I then do?
I should choose Alpha.

00:31:46.849 --> 00:31:49.849
If these are my payoffs I
should go ahead and choose Alpha

00:31:49.849 --> 00:31:51.849
because that way I end up
getting 3.

00:31:51.849 --> 00:31:54.170
So there's two things wrong
with the argument.

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:56.452
One, there's this magical
reasoning aspect,

00:31:56.452 --> 00:31:58.789
my reasoning is controlling
your actions.

00:31:58.789 --> 00:32:00.289
That doesn't happen in the real
world.

00:32:00.289 --> 00:32:08.151
And two, even if that was the
case I'd do better to myself

00:32:08.151 --> 00:32:11.108
choose Alpha.
So, nevertheless,

00:32:11.108 --> 00:32:13.670
there's an element of truth in
what I just said.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:17.325
It's the fact that there's an
element of truth in it that

00:32:17.325 --> 00:32:19.740
makes it seem like a good
argument.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.163
The element of truth is this.
It is true that by both

00:32:23.163 --> 00:32:27.339
choosing Alpha we both ended up
with B-'s.

00:32:27.339 --> 00:32:32.539
We both end up with payoffs of
0, rather than payoffs of 1.

00:32:32.539 --> 00:32:35.633
It is true that by both
choosing, by both following this

00:32:35.633 --> 00:32:38.670
lesson and not choosing the
dominated strategy Beta,

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:43.710
we ended up with payoffs,
(0,0), that were bad.

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:49.460
And that's probably the second
lesson of the class.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.804
So Lesson 2,
and this lesson probably

00:32:51.804 --> 00:32:55.191
wouldn't be worth stating,
if it wasn't for sort of a

00:32:55.191 --> 00:32:59.099
century of thought and economics
that said the opposite.

00:32:59.099 --> 00:33:02.782
So rational choice [in
this case, people not choosing a

00:33:02.782 --> 00:33:07.225
dominated strategy;
people choosing a dominant

00:33:07.225 --> 00:33:11.989
strategy]
rational choice can lead to

00:33:11.989 --> 00:33:18.830
outcomes that - what do
Americans call this?--that

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:22.987
"suck."
If you want a more technical

00:33:22.987 --> 00:33:25.779
term for that (and you remember
this from Economics 115),

00:33:25.779 --> 00:33:27.654
it can lead to outcomes that
are "inefficient,"

00:33:27.654 --> 00:33:30.309
that are "Pareto inefficient,"
but "suck" will do for today.

00:33:30.309 --> 00:33:35.369
Rational choices by rational
players, can lead to bad

00:33:35.369 --> 00:33:38.377
outcomes.
So this is a famous example for

00:33:38.377 --> 00:33:40.173
this reason.
It's a good illustration of

00:33:40.173 --> 00:33:41.500
this point.
It's a famous example.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.869
What's the name of this
example, somebody?

00:33:44.869 --> 00:33:46.140
This is called Prisoner's
Dilemma.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:48.869
How many of you have heard of
the Prisoner's Dilemma before?

00:33:48.869 --> 00:33:53.081
Most of you saw it in 115,
why is it called the Prisoner's

00:33:53.081 --> 00:33:57.060
Dilemma?
Yes, the guy here in orange.

00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.961
That's okay;
he can just point at you that's

00:33:58.961 --> 00:34:00.816
fine.
Student: I think it's

00:34:00.816 --> 00:34:04.095
whether or not the prisoner's
cooperate in the sentence they

00:34:04.095 --> 00:34:05.886
have,
and if they kind of rat out the

00:34:05.886 --> 00:34:07.579
other person,
then they can have less;

00:34:07.579 --> 00:34:10.940
but if both rat out,
then they like end up losing

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:12.925
large scale.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:34:12.925 --> 00:34:15.159
Good, so in the standard story
you've got these two crooks,

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:18.078
or two accused crooks,
and they're in separate cells

00:34:18.078 --> 00:34:21.282
and they're being interviewed
separately--kept apart--and

00:34:21.282 --> 00:34:24.428
they're both told that if
neither of them rats the other

00:34:24.428 --> 00:34:26.893
guy out,
they'll go to jail for say a

00:34:26.893 --> 00:34:28.424
year.
If they both rat each other

00:34:28.424 --> 00:34:31.035
out, they'll end up in jail for
two years, But if you rat the

00:34:31.035 --> 00:34:32.949
other guy out and he doesn't rat
you out,

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:37.719
then you will go home free and
he'll go to jail for five years.

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:40.278
Put that all down and you
pretty quickly see that,

00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:42.785
regardless whether the other
guy rats you or not,

00:34:42.785 --> 00:34:44.769
you're better off ratting him
out.

00:34:44.769 --> 00:34:47.795
Now, if you have never seen
that Prisoner's Dilemma,

00:34:47.795 --> 00:34:50.998
you can see it pretty much
every night on a show called

00:34:50.998 --> 00:34:53.997
Law &amp; Order.
How many of you have seen

00:34:53.997 --> 00:34:56.429
Law &amp; Order?
If you haven't seen Law

00:34:56.429 --> 00:34:58.231
&amp; Order,
the way to see Law &amp;

00:34:58.231 --> 00:34:59.949
Order is to go to a random
TV set,

00:34:59.949 --> 00:35:06.190
at a random time,
and turn on a random channel.

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:08.731
This happens in every single
episode, so much so that if any

00:35:08.731 --> 00:35:11.057
of you actually - I mean this
might actually be true at

00:35:11.057 --> 00:35:13.684
Yale--but if you any of you or
the TV guys: if any of you know

00:35:13.684 --> 00:35:15.579
the guy who writes the plots for
this,

00:35:15.579 --> 00:35:18.632
have him come to the class (so
I guess to see the video now)

00:35:18.632 --> 00:35:20.960
and we get some better plot
lines in there.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.260
But, of course,
that's not the only example.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.489
The grade game and this is not
the only example.

00:35:25.489 --> 00:35:28.079
There are lots of examples of
Prisoner's Dilemmas out there.

00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:30.550
Let's try and find some other
ones.

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:32.980
So how many of you have
roommates in your college?

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:36.244
How many of you have roommates?
Most of you have roommates

00:35:36.244 --> 00:35:37.670
right?
So I'm guessing now,

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:40.423
I won't make you show your
hands, because it's probably

00:35:40.423 --> 00:35:42.980
embarrassing,
but what is the state of your

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:46.099
dorm rooms, your shared dorm
rooms, at the end of the

00:35:46.099 --> 00:35:48.619
semester or the end of the
school year?

00:35:48.619 --> 00:35:50.540
So I'm just guessing,
having been in a few of these

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:52.230
things over the years,
that by the end of the

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:54.374
semester,
or certainly by the end of the

00:35:54.374 --> 00:35:57.662
school year, the state of the
average Yale dorm room is quite

00:35:57.662 --> 00:36:02.329
disgusting.
Why is it disgusting?

00:36:02.329 --> 00:36:04.059
It's disgusting because people
don't tidy up.

00:36:04.059 --> 00:36:07.184
They don't clean up those bits
of pizza and bits of chewed

00:36:07.184 --> 00:36:09.760
bread and cheese,
but why don't they tidy up?

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.470
Well let's just work it out.
What would you like to happen

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:15.695
if you're sharing a dorm room?
You'd like to have the other

00:36:15.695 --> 00:36:18.265
guy tidy up, right?
The best thing for you is to

00:36:18.265 --> 00:36:21.352
have the other guy tidy up and
the worst thing for you is to

00:36:21.352 --> 00:36:23.606
tidy up for the other guy.
But now work it out:

00:36:23.606 --> 00:36:25.849
it's a Prisoner's Dilemma.
If the other guy doesn't tidy

00:36:25.849 --> 00:36:28.347
up, you're best off not tidying
up either, because the last

00:36:28.347 --> 00:36:30.760
thing you want is to be tidying
up for the other guy.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.583
And if the other guy does tidy
up, hey the room's clean,

00:36:33.583 --> 00:36:34.696
who cares?
So either way,

00:36:34.696 --> 00:36:36.859
you're not going to tidy up and
you end up with a typical Yale

00:36:36.859 --> 00:36:37.980
dorm room.
Am I being unfair?

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.404
Are your dorm rooms all perfect?
This may be a gender thing but

00:36:41.404 --> 00:36:45.078
we're not going to go there.
So there are lots of Prisoner's

00:36:45.078 --> 00:36:48.300
Dilemmas out there,
anyone got any other examples?

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:53.199
Other examples?
I didn't quite hear that, sorry.

00:36:53.199 --> 00:36:55.659
Let's try and get a mike on it
so we can really hear it.

00:36:55.659 --> 00:37:01.448
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ben Polak:

00:37:01.448 --> 00:37:05.199
Okay, in divorce struggles,
okay.

00:37:05.199 --> 00:37:07.894
You're too young to be worrying
about such things but never

00:37:07.894 --> 00:37:09.425
mind.
Yeah, okay, that's a good

00:37:09.425 --> 00:37:11.652
example.
All right, hiring lawyers,

00:37:11.652 --> 00:37:15.989
bringing in big guns.
What about an Economics example?

00:37:15.989 --> 00:37:18.789
What about firms who are
competing in prices?

00:37:18.789 --> 00:37:22.001
Both firms have an incentive to
undercut the other firm,

00:37:22.001 --> 00:37:25.030
driving down profits for both.
The last thing you want is to

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:27.190
have the other firm undercut
you, in an attempt to push

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:29.132
prices down.
That's good for us the

00:37:29.132 --> 00:37:32.670
consumers, but bad for the firm,
bad for industry profit.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:35.133
What remedies do we see?
We'll come back to this later

00:37:35.133 --> 00:37:36.769
on in the class,
but let's have a preview.

00:37:36.769 --> 00:37:40.340
So what remedies do we see in
society for Prisoner's Dilemmas?

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.817
What kind of remedies do we see?
Let me try and get the guy here

00:37:43.817 --> 00:37:48.059
right in front.
Student: Collusion.

00:37:48.059 --> 00:37:48.700
Professor Ben Polak:
Collusion;

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:55.207
so firms could collude.
So what prevents them from

00:37:55.207 --> 00:37:58.010
colluding?
One thing they could do,

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:00.530
presumably, is they could write
a contract, these firms.

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:02.908
They could say I won't lower my
prices if you don't lower your

00:38:02.908 --> 00:38:05.131
prices, and they could put this
contract in with the pricy

00:38:05.131 --> 00:38:06.972
lawyer,
who's taking a day off from the

00:38:06.972 --> 00:38:09.022
divorce court,
and that would secure that they

00:38:09.022 --> 00:38:10.800
wouldn't lower prices on each
other.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:15.099
Is that right?
So why wouldn't that work?

00:38:15.099 --> 00:38:19.390
Why wouldn't writing a contract
here work?

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:23.280
It's against the law.
It's an illegal contract.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.510
What about you with your
roommates?

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:28.127
How many of you have a written
contract, stuck with a magnet on

00:38:28.127 --> 00:38:31.161
the fridge, telling you,
when you're supposed to tidy

00:38:31.161 --> 00:38:32.389
up.
Very few of you.

00:38:32.389 --> 00:38:37.025
Why do you manage to get some
cooperation between you and your

00:38:37.025 --> 00:38:40.369
roommates even without a written
contract?

00:38:40.369 --> 00:38:42.139
Student: It's not
legally enforceable.

00:38:42.139 --> 00:38:43.465
Professor Ben Polak:
Well it probably is legally

00:38:43.465 --> 00:38:44.573
enforceable actually.
This guy says not,

00:38:44.573 --> 00:38:45.780
but it probably is legally
enforceable.

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:48.507
He probably could have a
written contract about tidying

00:38:48.507 --> 00:38:50.170
up.
The woman in here.

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:52.090
Student: Repetition;
you do it over and over.

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:55.247
Professor Ben Polak:
Yeah, so maybe even among your

00:38:55.247 --> 00:38:58.405
roommates, maybe you don't need
a contract because you can

00:38:58.405 --> 00:39:01.605
manage to achieve the same ends,
by the fact that you're going

00:39:01.605 --> 00:39:04.016
to be interacting with the same
person, over and over again

00:39:04.016 --> 00:39:07.002
during your time at Yale.
So we'll come back and revisit

00:39:07.002 --> 00:39:10.283
the idea that repeating an
interaction may allow you to

00:39:10.283 --> 00:39:12.515
obtain cooperation,
but we're not going to come

00:39:12.515 --> 00:39:13.809
back to that until after the
mid-term.

00:39:13.809 --> 00:39:16.440
That's way down the road but
we'll get there.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.055
Now one person earlier on had
mentioned something about

00:39:19.055 --> 00:39:20.668
communication.
I think it was somebody in the

00:39:20.668 --> 00:39:22.485
front, right?
So let's just think about this

00:39:22.485 --> 00:39:24.178
a second.
Is communication the problem

00:39:24.178 --> 00:39:26.017
here?
Is the reason people behave

00:39:26.017 --> 00:39:28.938
badly--I don't know
"badly"--people choose Alpha in

00:39:28.938 --> 00:39:31.566
this game here,
is it the fact that they can't

00:39:31.566 --> 00:39:34.067
communicate?
Suppose you'd been able to talk

00:39:34.067 --> 00:39:36.400
before hand, so suppose the
woman here whose name

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.590
was…?
Student: Mary.

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:38.554
Professor Ben Polak:
…Mary,

00:39:38.554 --> 00:39:39.928
had been able to talk to the
person next to her whose name

00:39:39.928 --> 00:39:40.809
is…?
Student: Erica.

00:39:40.809 --> 00:39:41.539
Professor Ben Polak:
Erica.

00:39:41.539 --> 00:39:43.580
And they said,
suppose we know we're going to

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.852
be paired together,
I'll choose Beta if you choose

00:39:45.852 --> 00:39:48.540
Beta.
Would that work?

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:53.316
Why wouldn't that work?
Student: There's no

00:39:53.316 --> 00:39:54.212
enforcement.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:39:54.212 --> 00:39:56.788
There's no enforcement.
So it isn't a failure of

00:39:56.788 --> 00:40:00.155
communication per se.
A contract is more then

00:40:00.155 --> 00:40:02.678
communication,
a contract is communication

00:40:02.678 --> 00:40:05.260
with teeth.
It actually changes the payoffs.

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:07.769
So I could communicate with
Alice on agreements,

00:40:07.769 --> 00:40:11.079
but back home I'm going to go
ahead and choose Alpha anyway;

00:40:11.079 --> 00:40:13.340
all the better if he's choosing
Beta.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:15.441
So we'll come back and talk
about more of these things as

00:40:15.441 --> 00:40:17.929
the course goes on,
but let's just come back to the

00:40:17.929 --> 00:40:20.616
two we forgot there:
so the collusion case and the

00:40:20.616 --> 00:40:23.521
case back in Law &amp;
Order with the prisoners in the

00:40:23.521 --> 00:40:25.014
cell.
How do they enforce their

00:40:25.014 --> 00:40:26.655
contracts?
They don't always rat each

00:40:26.655 --> 00:40:28.730
other out and some firms manage
to collude?

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:32.369
How do they manage to enforce
those contracts?

00:40:32.369 --> 00:40:34.619
Those agreements,
how are they enforced?

00:40:34.619 --> 00:40:35.349
Student: They trust each
other.

00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:37.589
Professor Ben Polak: It
could be they trust each other,

00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:39.315
although if you trust a crook
that's not…

00:40:39.315 --> 00:40:41.896
What else could it be?
The guy here again with the

00:40:41.896 --> 00:40:43.851
beard, yeah.
Student: Could be a zero

00:40:43.851 --> 00:40:44.858
sum game.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:40:44.858 --> 00:40:45.869
Well, but this is the game.
So here's the game.

00:40:45.869 --> 00:40:47.317
Student: No,
but the pay,

00:40:47.317 --> 00:40:49.371
the way they value,
the way of valuing each--

00:40:49.371 --> 00:40:51.892
Professor Ben Polak:
Okay, so the payoffs may be

00:40:51.892 --> 00:40:53.883
different.
I have something simpler in

00:40:53.883 --> 00:40:56.090
mind.
Suppose they have a written

00:40:56.090 --> 00:41:00.165
contract, or even an unwritten
contract, what enforces the

00:41:00.165 --> 00:41:03.740
contract for colluding firms or
crooks in jail?

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:05.977
Yeah.
Student: Gets off Scott

00:41:05.977 --> 00:41:08.150
free in five years when the
other guy gets out,

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:09.813
he might run into a situation
where [inaudible]

00:41:09.813 --> 00:41:11.079
Professor Ben Polak:
Yeah,

00:41:11.079 --> 00:41:13.514
so a short version of that is,
it's a different kind of

00:41:13.514 --> 00:41:16.300
contract.
If you rat someone out in jail,

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.960
someone puts a contract out on
you.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.869
Tony Soprano enforces those
contracts.

00:41:20.869 --> 00:41:22.470
That's the purpose of Tony
Soprano.

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:25.478
It's the purpose of the mafia.
The reason the mafia thrives in

00:41:25.478 --> 00:41:28.591
countries where it's hard to
write legal contracts--let's say

00:41:28.591 --> 00:41:31.549
some new parts of the former
Soviet Union or some parts of

00:41:31.549 --> 00:41:34.869
Africa--the reason the mafia
thrives in those environments,

00:41:34.869 --> 00:41:39.591
is that it substitutes for the
law and enforces both legal and

00:41:39.591 --> 00:41:42.897
illegal contracts.
So I promised a while ago now,

00:41:42.897 --> 00:41:46.587
that we were going to come back
and look at this game under some

00:41:46.587 --> 00:41:50.367
other possible payoffs.
So I wasn't under a contract

00:41:50.367 --> 00:41:54.639
but let's come back and fulfill
that promise anyway.

00:41:54.639 --> 00:41:58.769
So we're going to revisit,
if not the Divinity School,

00:41:58.769 --> 00:42:03.366
at least in people who have
more morality than my friends up

00:42:03.366 --> 00:42:07.334
in the business school.
We're going to ask for the same

00:42:07.334 --> 00:42:09.679
grade game we played at the
beginning.

00:42:09.679 --> 00:42:19.150
What would happen if player's
payoffs looked different?

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:22.080
So these are "possible payoffs
(2)."

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:25.797
I'll give these a name..
We called the other guys "evil

00:42:25.797 --> 00:42:30.510
gits." We'll call these
guys "indignant angels."

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:33.220
I can never spell indignant..
Is that roughly right?

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.110
Does that look right?
I think it's right.

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.705
In-dig-nant isn't it: indignant.
Indignant angels,

00:42:37.705 --> 00:42:43.004
and we'll see why in a second.
So here are their payoffs and

00:42:43.004 --> 00:42:51.130
once again the basic structure
of the game hasn't changed.

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:54.170
It's still I'm choosing Alpha
and Beta, my pair is choosing

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:56.529
Alpha and Beta,
and the grades are the same as

00:42:56.529 --> 00:42:59.436
they were before.
They're hidden by that board

00:42:59.436 --> 00:43:02.514
but you saw them before.
But this time the payoffs are

00:43:02.514 --> 00:43:05.212
as follows.
On the lead diagonal we still

00:43:05.212 --> 00:43:09.037
have (0,0) and (1,1).
But now the grades here are

00:43:09.037 --> 00:43:14.011
-1--I'm sorry--the payoffs are
-1 and -3, and here they're -3

00:43:14.011 --> 00:43:16.760
and -1.
What's the idea here?

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.210
These aren't the only other
possible payoffs.

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:23.929
It's just an idea.
Suppose I get an A and my pair

00:43:23.929 --> 00:43:28.869
gets a C, then sure I get that
initial payoff of 3,

00:43:28.869 --> 00:43:32.197
but unfortunately I can't sleep
at night because I'm feeling so

00:43:32.197 --> 00:43:34.352
guilty.
I have some kind of moral

00:43:34.352 --> 00:43:38.165
conscience and after I've
subtracted off my guilt feelings

00:43:38.165 --> 00:43:41.949
I end up at -1,
so think of this as guilt:

00:43:41.949 --> 00:43:46.530
some notion of morality.
Conversely, if I chose a Beta

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:50.658
and my pair chooses an Alpha,
so I end up with a C and she

00:43:50.658 --> 00:43:53.890
ends up with an A,
then you know I have a bad time

00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:56.869
explaining to my parents why I
got a C in this class,

00:43:56.869 --> 00:43:59.130
and I have to say about how I'm
going to be president anyway.

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:02.096
But then, in addition,
I feel indignation against this

00:44:02.096 --> 00:44:03.659
person.
It isn't just that I got a C;

00:44:03.659 --> 00:44:10.164
I got a C because she made me
get a C, so that moral

00:44:10.164 --> 00:44:16.104
indignation takes us down to -3.
So again, I'm not claiming

00:44:16.104 --> 00:44:18.635
these are the only other
possible payoffs,

00:44:18.635 --> 00:44:21.289
but just another possibility to
look at.

00:44:21.289 --> 00:44:24.679
So suppose these were the
payoffs in the game.

00:44:24.679 --> 00:44:27.312
Again, suspend disbelief a
second and imagine that these

00:44:27.312 --> 00:44:29.850
actually are your payoffs,
and let me ask you what you

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:33.780
would have done in this case.
So think about it a second.

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.736
Write it down.
Write down what you're going to

00:44:35.736 --> 00:44:36.940
do on the corner of your
notepad.

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.851
Just write down an Alpha or
Beta: what you're going to do

00:44:38.851 --> 00:44:40.889
here.
You're not all writing.

00:44:40.889 --> 00:44:41.980
The guy in the England shirt
isn't writing.

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:45.560
You've got to be writing if you
are in an England shirt.

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:49.652
Show it to your neighbor.
Let's have a show of hands,

00:44:49.652 --> 00:44:52.368
again I want you to keep your
hands up so that Jude can see it

00:44:52.368 --> 00:44:55.236
now.
So how many of you chose Alpha

00:44:55.236 --> 00:44:57.080
in this case?
Raise your hands.

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.690
Come on, don't be shy.
Raise your hands.

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:01.550
How many chose Beta in this
case?

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:04.133
How many people abstained?
Not allowed to abstain:

00:45:04.133 --> 00:45:05.820
let's try it again.
Alpha in this case?

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:09.349
No abstentions here.
Beta in this case?

00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:12.390
So we're roughly splitting the
room.

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:15.800
Someone who chose Alpha?
Again: raise the Alpha's again.

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:20.710
Let me get this guy here.
So why did you choose Alpha?

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:22.639
Student: You would
minimize your losses;

00:45:22.639 --> 00:45:26.159
you'd get 0 or -1 instead of -3
or 1.

00:45:26.159 --> 00:45:27.577
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so this gentleman is

00:45:27.577 --> 00:45:28.971
saying - Student: There's
no dominant strategy so -

00:45:28.971 --> 00:45:29.900
Professor Ben Polak:
Right,

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:33.364
so this gentleman's saying,
a good reason for choosing

00:45:33.364 --> 00:45:35.980
Alpha in this game is it's less
risky.

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:39.440
The worst case scenario is less
bad, is a way of saying it.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.640
What about somebody who chose
Beta?

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.085
A lot of you chose Beta.
Let's have a show of hands on

00:45:43.085 --> 00:45:45.160
the Beta's again.
Let me see the Beta's again.

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:48.989
So, raise your hands.
Can we get the woman here?

00:45:48.989 --> 00:45:51.929
Can we ask her why she chose
Beta?

00:45:51.929 --> 00:45:53.634
Student: Because if you
choose Alpha,

00:45:53.634 --> 00:45:55.139
the best case scenario is you
get 0,

00:45:55.139 --> 00:45:56.496
so that's - Professor Ben
Polak: Okay good,

00:45:56.496 --> 00:45:58.567
that's a good counter argument.
So the gentleman here was

00:45:58.567 --> 00:46:01.206
looking at the worst case
scenario, and the woman here was

00:46:01.206 --> 00:46:02.920
looking at the best case
scenario.

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:07.659
And the best case scenario here
looks like getting a 1 here.

00:46:07.659 --> 00:46:09.380
Now, let's ask a different
question.

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:14.179
Is one of the strategies
dominated in this game?

00:46:14.179 --> 00:46:15.610
No, neither strategy is
dominated.

00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:18.573
Let's just check.
If my pair chooses Alpha,

00:46:18.573 --> 00:46:22.920
then my choosing Alpha yields
0, Beta -3: so Alpha would be

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.565
better.
But if my pair chooses Beta

00:46:25.565 --> 00:46:28.022
then Alpha yields -1,
Beta yields 1:

00:46:28.022 --> 00:46:30.619
in this case Beta would be
better.

00:46:30.619 --> 00:46:33.654
So Alpha in this case is better
against Alpha,

00:46:33.654 --> 00:46:37.565
and Beta is better against
Beta, but neither dominates each

00:46:37.565 --> 00:46:40.057
other.
So here's a game where we just

00:46:40.057 --> 00:46:42.338
change the payoffs.
We have the same basic

00:46:42.338 --> 00:46:45.058
structure, the same outcomes,
but we imagine people cared

00:46:45.058 --> 00:46:47.827
about different things and we
end up with a very different

00:46:47.827 --> 00:46:49.402
answer.
In the first game,

00:46:49.402 --> 00:46:52.488
it was kind of clear that we
should choose Alpha and here

00:46:52.488 --> 00:46:55.739
it's not at all clear what we
can do--what we should do.

00:46:55.739 --> 00:46:58.264
In fact, this kind of game has
a name and we'll revisit it

00:46:58.264 --> 00:47:04.143
later on in the semester.
This kind of game is called a

00:47:04.143 --> 00:47:09.965
"coordination problem."
We'll talk about coordination

00:47:09.965 --> 00:47:12.479
problems later on.
The main lesson I want to get

00:47:12.479 --> 00:47:14.360
out of this for today,
is a simpler lesson.

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:17.260
It's the lesson that payoffs
matter.

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:20.313
We change the payoffs,
we change what people cared

00:47:20.313 --> 00:47:23.429
about, and we get a very
different game with a very

00:47:23.429 --> 00:47:27.648
different outcome.
So the basic lesson is that

00:47:27.648 --> 00:47:32.291
payoffs matter,
but let me say it a different

00:47:32.291 --> 00:47:34.369
way.
So without giving away my age

00:47:34.369 --> 00:47:36.725
too much--I guess it will
actually--when I was a kid

00:47:36.725 --> 00:47:39.657
growing up in England,
there was this guy - there was

00:47:39.657 --> 00:47:43.329
a pop star--a slightly post-punk
pop star called Joe Jackson,

00:47:43.329 --> 00:47:45.002
who none of you would have
heard of, because you were all

00:47:45.002 --> 00:47:46.309
about ten years old,
my fault.

00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:50.263
And Joe Jackson had this song
which had the lyric,

00:47:50.263 --> 00:47:53.894
something like,
you can't get what you want

00:47:53.894 --> 00:47:56.960
unless you know what you
want.

00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:00.400
As a statement of logic,
that's false.

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.025
It could be that what you want
just drops into your lap without

00:48:03.025 --> 00:48:05.638
you knowing about it.
But as a statement of strategy,

00:48:05.638 --> 00:48:08.506
it's a pretty good idea.
It's a good idea to try and

00:48:08.506 --> 00:48:11.484
figure out what your goals
are--what you're trying to

00:48:11.484 --> 00:48:14.520
achieve--before you go ahead and
analyze the game.

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:21.440
So payoffs matter.
Let's put it in his version.

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:39.389
"You can't get what you want,
till you know what you want."

00:48:39.389 --> 00:48:42.599
Be honest, how many of you have
heard of Joe Jackson?

00:48:42.599 --> 00:48:47.850
That makes me feel old,
oh man, okay.

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:52.487
Goes down every year.
So far we've looked at this

00:48:52.487 --> 00:48:57.670
game as played by people who are
evil gits, and we've looked at

00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:02.519
this game as played by people
who are indignant angels.

00:49:02.519 --> 00:49:04.650
But we can do something more
interesting.

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:08.780
We can imagine playing this
game on a sort of mix and match.

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:11.921
For example,
imagine--this shouldn't be hard

00:49:11.921 --> 00:49:15.719
for most of you--imagine that
you are an evil git,

00:49:15.719 --> 00:49:20.654
but you know that the person
you're playing against is an

00:49:20.654 --> 00:49:24.118
indignant angel.
So again, imagine that you know

00:49:24.118 --> 00:49:26.966
you're an evil git,
but you know that the person

00:49:26.966 --> 00:49:30.420
you're playing against or with,
is an indignant angel.

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:36.820
What should you do in that case?
What should we do?

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.349
Who thinks you should choose
Alpha in that case?

00:49:38.349 --> 00:49:40.639
Let's pan the room again if we
can.

00:49:40.639 --> 00:49:44.539
Keep your hands up so that you
can see.

00:49:44.539 --> 00:49:47.430
Who thinks you should choose
Beta in that case?

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:50.434
Who's abstaining here?
Not allowed to abstain in this

00:49:50.434 --> 00:49:52.483
class: it's a complete no-no.
Okay, we'll allow some

00:49:52.483 --> 00:49:54.720
abstention in the first day but
not beyond today.

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:59.654
Let's have a look.
Let's analyze this combined

00:49:59.654 --> 00:50:03.219
game.
So what does this game look

00:50:03.219 --> 00:50:07.780
like?
It's an evil git versus an

00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:16.767
indignant angel and we can put
the payoff matrix together by

00:50:16.767 --> 00:50:22.860
combining the matrices we had
before.

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:27.050
So in this case,
this is me as always.

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:30.960
This is my pair,
the column player.

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:34.723
My payoffs are going to be what?
My payoffs are going to be

00:50:34.723 --> 00:50:37.221
evil-git payoffs,
so they come from the matrix up

00:50:37.221 --> 00:50:38.807
there.
So if someone will just help me

00:50:38.807 --> 00:50:47.639
reading it off there.
That's a 0, a 3,a -1, and a 1.

00:50:47.639 --> 00:50:52.526
My opponent or my partner's
payoffs come from the indignant

00:50:52.526 --> 00:50:54.719
angel matrix.
So they come from here.

00:50:54.719 --> 00:51:01.170
There's a 0,
a -3, a -1, and a 1.

00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:02.289
Everyone see how I constructed
that?

00:51:02.289 --> 00:51:05.623
So just to remind you again,
the first payoff is the row

00:51:05.623 --> 00:51:08.349
player's payoff,
in this case the evil git.

00:51:08.349 --> 00:51:12.020
And the second payoff is the
column player's payoff,

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:14.539
in this case the indignant
angel.

00:51:14.539 --> 00:51:17.133
Now we've set it up as a
matrix, let's try again that

00:51:17.133 --> 00:51:20.576
question I asked before.
Suppose you're the row player

00:51:20.576 --> 00:51:21.960
here.
You're the evil git.

00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:25.069
Those are your payoffs.
You're playing against an

00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:27.659
indignant angel,
what would you do?

00:51:27.659 --> 00:51:29.408
So once again,
no abstentions this time:

00:51:29.408 --> 00:51:32.316
who would choose Alpha?
Let's have a show of hands

00:51:32.316 --> 00:51:34.790
again, keep your hands up a
second.

00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:38.218
Who would choose Beta?
Very few Beta's,

00:51:38.218 --> 00:51:40.019
but mostly Alpha's.
Alpha, I think,

00:51:40.019 --> 00:51:42.150
is the right answer here but
why?

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:45.210
Why is Alpha the right answer
here?

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:47.663
Yeah, can we get this guy here?
Student: It's the

00:51:47.663 --> 00:51:48.695
dominant strategy.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:51:48.695 --> 00:51:50.115
Good.
Actually nothing has changed

00:51:50.115 --> 00:51:52.918
from the game we started with.
The fact that I changed the

00:51:52.918 --> 00:51:54.929
other guy's payoffs didn't
matter here.

00:51:54.929 --> 00:51:58.381
Alpha was dominant before--it
dominated Beta before--and it

00:51:58.381 --> 00:52:01.050
still dominates Beta.
Let's just check.

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:04.274
If my opponent chooses Alpha
and I choose Alpha,

00:52:04.274 --> 00:52:05.980
I get 0;
Beta, I get -1.

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:09.265
So Alpha would be better.
If my opponent chooses Beta and

00:52:09.265 --> 00:52:10.770
I choose Alpha,
I get 3;

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:13.110
Beta, I get 1.
Once again Alpha is better.

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:15.846
So as before,
Alpha does better than Beta for

00:52:15.846 --> 00:52:18.770
me, regardless of what the other
person does.

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:24.079
Alpha dominates Beta.
What was the first lesson of

00:52:24.079 --> 00:52:27.400
the class?
Shout it out please.

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:31.596
Right, so you should all have
been choosing in this game,

00:52:31.596 --> 00:52:34.219
you all should have chosen
Alpha.

00:52:34.219 --> 00:52:37.160
So the one person who didn't
we'll let him off for today.

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:50.550
So Alpha dominates Beta here.
Let's flip things around.

00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:55.573
Suppose now--harder to imagine,
but let's try it--suppose now

00:52:55.573 --> 00:53:00.679
that you are an indignant angel
and you're playing against,

00:53:00.679 --> 00:53:06.946
and you know this,
you're playing against an evil

00:53:06.946 --> 00:53:09.051
git.
You're an indignant angel,

00:53:09.051 --> 00:53:11.794
so you have the payoffs that
are still there and you're

00:53:11.794 --> 00:53:14.718
playing against an evil git,
which is the payoffs we covered

00:53:14.718 --> 00:53:17.090
up but we'll reproduce them.
Let's produce that matrix.

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:19.970
By the way, if this is
beginning to sound like a

00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:22.300
wrestling match,
I don't mean it to.

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:26.344
Let's try here:
Alpha, Beta,

00:53:26.344 --> 00:53:29.940
Alpha, Beta,
pair, me.

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:32.702
So my payoffs this time,
are the indignant angel

00:53:32.702 --> 00:53:41.289
payoffs.
So mine are 0, -1, -3, and 1.

00:53:41.289 --> 00:53:44.472
And my opponent's payoffs are
what would have been my payoffs

00:53:44.472 --> 00:53:46.090
before.
They come from the other matrix.

00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:48.769
Let's just show you it.
They come from this matrix.

00:53:48.769 --> 00:53:56.800
So they're going to be 0,
-1,3, 1.

00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:02.631
I took the second payoff from
that matrix and made it the

00:54:02.631 --> 00:54:06.510
second payoff in this matrix.
Everyone see how I did that?

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:11.451
Once again, the row player is
the first payoff and the column

00:54:11.451 --> 00:54:15.810
player is the other payoff.
What should you do in this case?

00:54:15.810 --> 00:54:18.033
You're the indignant angel.
You're playing against this

00:54:18.033 --> 00:54:19.789
evil git.
What should you do?

00:54:19.789 --> 00:54:21.199
Write down on your notepad what
you should do.

00:54:21.199 --> 00:54:26.192
Show it to your neighbor so you
can't cheat, or you can cheat

00:54:26.192 --> 00:54:30.270
but you'll be shamed in front of
your neighbor.

00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:31.849
Raise your hands.
Let Jude see it.

00:54:31.849 --> 00:54:37.450
Raise your hands and keep them
up if you chose Alpha now.

00:54:37.450 --> 00:54:41.638
How about if you chose Beta now?
So one or two Beta's,

00:54:41.638 --> 00:54:43.239
mostly Alpha's.
Well let's see.

00:54:43.239 --> 00:54:45.110
Let's reason this through a
second.

00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:50.727
Does my Alpha dominate my Beta?
No, in fact,

00:54:50.727 --> 00:54:52.880
Alpha doesn't dominate Beta for
me.

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:56.167
It doesn't dominate Beta.
If my pair chooses Alpha then

00:54:56.167 --> 00:54:58.600
Alpha gets me 0;
Beta -3.

00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:01.436
So Alpha does better.
But if my pair chooses Beta,

00:55:01.436 --> 00:55:03.970
then Alpha gets me -1;
Beta gets me 1.

00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:06.493
In this case Beta is better.
As we saw before,

00:55:06.493 --> 00:55:09.539
Alpha is better against Alpha.
Beta is better against Beta.

00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:12.230
There's no dominance going on
here.

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:15.073
Nevertheless,
at least 90% of you chose Alpha

00:55:15.073 --> 00:55:17.400
here, and that's the right
answer.

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.300
Why?
Why should you choose Alpha

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:22.091
here?
Somebody …

00:55:22.091 --> 00:55:25.270
can we get the guy with the
beard here?

00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:28.172
Wait for the mike, great.
Student: We had

00:55:28.172 --> 00:55:30.636
acknowledged that Alpha is a
dominant strategy for my

00:55:30.636 --> 00:55:32.579
opponent so we must choose based
upon,

00:55:32.579 --> 00:55:34.449
or knowing that my partner is
going to choose Alpha.

00:55:34.449 --> 00:55:36.970
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, and your name is?

00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:37.817
Student: Henry.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:55:37.817 --> 00:55:39.892
Henry.
So Henry is saying sure I don't

00:55:39.892 --> 00:55:44.337
have a dominated strategy.
My Alpha doesn't dominate my

00:55:44.337 --> 00:55:46.079
Beta.
But look at my opponent.

00:55:46.079 --> 00:55:49.309
My opponent's Alpha dominates
her Beta.

00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:54.340
If I choose Alpha and she
chooses Alpha to get 0;

00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:56.969
Beta she gets -1.
Alpha is better.

00:55:56.969 --> 00:56:00.052
If I choose Beta,
if she chooses Alpha she gets

00:56:00.052 --> 00:56:01.280
3;
Beta 1.

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:04.395
Again Alpha is better.
For my opponent,

00:56:04.395 --> 00:56:08.035
Alpha dominates Beta.
So by thinking about my

00:56:08.035 --> 00:56:11.569
opponent, by putting myself in
my opponent's shoes,

00:56:11.569 --> 00:56:15.032
I realize that she has a
dominant strategy,

00:56:15.032 --> 00:56:18.091
Alpha.
She's going to choose Alpha and

00:56:18.091 --> 00:56:22.360
my best response against Alpha
is to choose Alpha myself.

00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:32.795
So here, this time,
my Alpha does not dominate Beta

00:56:32.795 --> 00:56:43.231
but my pair's choice of Alpha
dominates her choice,

00:56:43.231 --> 00:56:55.840
her possible choice of Beta.
So she will choose Alpha.

00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:59.123
And once I know that she's
going to choose Alpha,

00:56:59.123 --> 00:57:03.433
it's clear that I should choose
Alpha and get 0 rather than Beta

00:57:03.433 --> 00:57:13.250
and get -3.
So I should choose Alpha also.

00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:16.110
Okay, so now we've seen four
different combinations.

00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:19.320
We've seen a case where an evil
git was playing an evil git;

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:21.250
where an indignant angel was
playing an indignant angel;

00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:23.446
and we've seen both the flips
of those: the evil git versus

00:57:23.446 --> 00:57:25.733
the indignant angel;
and the indignant angel against

00:57:25.733 --> 00:57:27.500
the evil git.
Why are we doing this?

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:29.430
Because there's an important
lesson here.

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:32.948
What's the lesson here?
The lesson is--comes from this

00:57:32.948 --> 00:57:35.312
game--that a great way to
analyze games,

00:57:35.312 --> 00:57:39.010
a great way to get used to the
idea of strategic thinking,

00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:42.462
perhaps even the essence of
strategic thinking,

00:57:42.462 --> 00:57:46.739
is the ability to put yourself
in someone else's shoes,

00:57:46.739 --> 00:57:51.017
figure out what their payoffs
are, and try and figure out what

00:57:51.017 --> 00:57:54.496
they're going to do.
So the big lesson of this game

00:57:54.496 --> 00:57:58.499
is--I forgot what number we're
up too--I guess this is Lesson 4

00:57:58.499 --> 00:58:03.522
I think.
Lesson 4 is:

00:58:03.522 --> 00:58:25.086
put yourself in others' shoes
and try to figure out what they

00:58:25.086 --> 00:58:30.441
will do.
In a sense, this is the first

00:58:30.441 --> 00:58:33.315
difficult lesson of the class.
It's easy to spot when a

00:58:33.315 --> 00:58:35.380
strategy is dominant,
more or less.

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:38.247
It's pretty easy to figure out,
you have to know about your own

00:58:38.247 --> 00:58:40.292
payoffs.
But the hard thing in life,

00:58:40.292 --> 00:58:43.282
is getting you to come out of
your own selves a bit,

00:58:43.282 --> 00:58:45.510
realizing it's "not all about
you."

00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:48.013
You've got to put yourself in
other people's shoes to figure

00:58:48.013 --> 00:58:50.432
out what they care about and
what they're going to try and

00:58:50.432 --> 00:58:54.670
do,
so you can respond well to that.

00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:57.123
While we're here,
let's just mention that things

00:58:57.123 --> 00:59:00.150
will get more complicated in a
world where I don't actually

00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:04.009
know the payoffs of my opponent.
It's much easier to figure out

00:59:04.009 --> 00:59:07.769
my own payoffs than to figure
out my opponent's payoffs.

00:59:07.769 --> 00:59:10.391
I might not know whether I'm
playing someone who's an evil

00:59:10.391 --> 00:59:12.944
git or an indignant angel.
So I'm going to have to figure

00:59:12.944 --> 00:59:15.219
out what the odds are of that in
doing this exercise.

00:59:15.219 --> 00:59:19.041
And we're going to come back to
that idea too way at the end of

00:59:19.041 --> 00:59:22.370
the class, but that's getting a
bit ahead of ourselves,

00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:24.945
but we'll get there.
Now, it turns out that this

00:59:24.945 --> 00:59:27.380
game, this Prisoner's Dilemma,
with the Alpha's and Beta's,

00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:30.171
or essentially the same game,
has been played many,

00:59:30.171 --> 00:59:32.070
many, many times in
experiments.

00:59:32.070 --> 00:59:35.625
So out there in the real
world--I think we can do this

00:59:35.625 --> 00:59:39.046
here--out there in the real
world when they do these

00:59:39.046 --> 00:59:45.333
experiments,
they find out that roughly 70%

00:59:45.333 --> 00:59:54.369
of people choose Alpha and
roughly 30% choose Beta.

00:59:54.369 --> 00:59:57.480
Roughly, almost a third choose
Beta.

00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:01.639
What do we think is going on?
That's a third of the people

01:00:01.639 --> 01:00:04.386
who seem to be choosing a
dominated strategy …

01:00:04.386 --> 01:00:06.210
or is it?
What's going on there?

01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:13.620
Why do you think 30% of people
are choosing Beta?

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:17.920
Anybody?
Can we catch this guy here?

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:21.503
Student: They might be
motivated by the fact that every

01:00:21.503 --> 01:00:24.500
person who chooses Beta raises
the average score.

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.809
Professor Ben Polak:
They could be moral people.

01:00:26.809 --> 01:00:30.080
So one possibility is:
this 30% of people in the real

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.910
world who choose Beta are just
nice people.

01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:36.820
What else could it be?
Yeah?

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:38.511
Student: I know this
might be changing the game a

01:00:38.511 --> 01:00:40.265
little bit, but if you ever
expected to play the same game

01:00:40.265 --> 01:00:41.526
with the partner you have more
[inaudible]

01:00:41.526 --> 01:00:42.880
Professor Ben Polak: All
right,

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.789
they could be thinking they're
going to play again.

01:00:45.789 --> 01:00:47.503
Student: [inaudible]
long run payoffs are greater if

01:00:47.503 --> 01:00:49.235
you choose Beta every time.
Professor Ben Polak: So

01:00:49.235 --> 01:00:51.046
it could be that they think that
this is actually--they haven't

01:00:51.046 --> 01:00:52.798
understood the experiment and
they think this is a multi shot

01:00:52.798 --> 01:00:55.060
game,
not a one shot game, good.

01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:57.639
What else could it be?
What's the simplest explanation?

01:00:57.639 --> 01:01:00.610
What's the other obvious
explanation?

01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:01.909
They could just be stupid,
right?

01:01:01.909 --> 01:01:03.732
It could be.,
Are we allowed to say that in

01:01:03.732 --> 01:01:05.222
class?
Let's be honest here,

01:01:05.222 --> 01:01:08.434
when we say experiments in the
real world in Game Theory--or

01:01:08.434 --> 01:01:11.699
the ones you read about in The
New York Times--the real world

01:01:11.699 --> 01:01:14.584
when it comes to experiments in
Economics really means

01:01:14.584 --> 01:01:17.360
undergraduates at the University
of Arizona.

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.450
I mean, I'm not making it up.
It just does.

01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:23.224
They all are.
I don't know anything about

01:01:23.224 --> 01:01:25.099
… are any of you from
Arizona, I don't know.

01:01:25.099 --> 01:01:27.615
I don't know whether the
average undergrad at the

01:01:27.615 --> 01:01:30.760
University of Arizona just has a
sunny personality or whether

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.699
they "spent too long in the
sun."

01:01:32.699 --> 01:01:36.460
I just don't know which it is,
right?

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:38.710
We can't really distinguish
from this.

01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:41.510
How about at Yale.
What's our numbers here.

01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:46.860
How about in this class?
Do you want to mike your

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:52.702
colleague here?
So 238 at Yale--this is

01:01:52.702 --> 01:01:56.744
Yale--versus 36.
So even at my level of

01:01:56.744 --> 01:01:59.110
arithmetic that's a lot less
than 30%.

01:01:59.110 --> 01:02:03.289
That's more like less than 15%.
It's about 15% I guess.

01:02:03.289 --> 01:02:09.510
So 236--I'm sorry 238--chose
Alpha, and 36 chose Beta.

01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:11.949
Now there's one more lesson in
this class and this is going to

01:02:11.949 --> 01:02:13.657
be it.
This isn't the end of the class

01:02:13.657 --> 01:02:15.179
but one more lesson to take
home.

01:02:15.179 --> 01:02:18.698
You guys are going to be
playing games among each other

01:02:18.698 --> 01:02:21.565
today and until--whatever it
is?--December 7,

01:02:21.565 --> 01:02:24.500
whatever is the end of term.
Look around each other.

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.719
You better get to know each
other a bit.

01:02:26.719 --> 01:02:31.820
And what did we learn today
about you guys?

01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:39.236
The lesson here,
Lesson 5, is "Yale students are

01:02:39.236 --> 01:02:48.230
evil." Be aware of that
when you're playing games.

01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:51.320
I want to play one more game
today in the remaining minutes.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.985
It doesn't matter if we finish
a little bit early,

01:02:52.985 --> 01:02:54.820
but I want to try to get this
game at least started.

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:58.360
So do you all have Game #2 in
front of you?

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.677
Just while you're reading that
over, can I also make sure

01:03:00.677 --> 01:03:03.119
you've all got your legal forms
and you're going to sign.

01:03:03.119 --> 01:03:05.384
Don't walk away with your legal
forms, we need to get those

01:03:05.384 --> 01:03:07.676
collected in.
So at the end of talking about

01:03:07.676 --> 01:03:11.202
this game, I'm going to collect
in both the second game for the

01:03:11.202 --> 01:03:15.543
class and also the legal form.
If you don't have a legal form,

01:03:15.543 --> 01:03:19.119
if you've lost it or something,
it's online.

01:03:19.119 --> 01:03:20.950
Let's have a look at that
second game.

01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:28.790
I'll read it out for you.
Game 2: "pick a number."

01:03:28.790 --> 01:03:30.900
Everyone got this?
Anyone not got this?

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:32.949
Everyone got it?
Good.

01:03:32.949 --> 01:03:35.995
"Without showing your neighbor
what you're doing,

01:03:35.995 --> 01:03:39.421
put in the box below a whole
number between 1 and a 100

01:03:39.421 --> 01:03:42.022
[whole number between 1 and
100--integer.]

01:03:42.022 --> 01:03:46.019
We will calculate the average
number chosen in the class.

01:03:46.019 --> 01:03:50.825
The winner in this game is the
person whose number is closest

01:03:50.825 --> 01:03:54.670
to two-thirds times the average
in the class."

01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:58.997
[Again: the winner is the
person whose number is closest

01:03:58.997 --> 01:04:03.089
to two-thirds times the average
number in the class.]

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:07.260
The winner will win $5 minus
the difference in pennies

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:12.059
between her choice and that
two-thirds of the average."

01:04:12.059 --> 01:04:16.370
Just to make sure you've
understood this,

01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:20.250
let me do an example on the
board.

01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:23.139
I've got one more board;
that's good.

01:04:23.139 --> 01:04:29.479
So imagine there were three
people in the class,

01:04:29.479 --> 01:04:35.280
and imagine that they chose
25,5, and 60.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:40.375
So 25 plus 5 plus 60 is 90.
People should feel free to

01:04:40.375 --> 01:04:42.270
correct my arithmetic because
it's often wrong;

01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:47.675
90 right?
Two-thirds of 90,

01:04:47.675 --> 01:04:54.630
whoops, what do I need,
start again.

01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:56.460
I need to divide it by three to
get the average.

01:04:56.460 --> 01:05:03.946
So the average is 30.
So the total is 90,

01:05:03.946 --> 01:05:06.699
the average is 30,
am I right so far?

01:05:06.699 --> 01:05:14.429
So two-thirds of the average is
20.

01:05:14.429 --> 01:05:15.480
I'm looking desperately at the
T.A.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:18.956
Is that right?
Okay, so the average is 30 and

01:05:18.956 --> 01:05:22.823
two-thirds of the average is 20.
So who's the winner here,

01:05:22.823 --> 01:05:24.840
which number would have won
here?

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:28.510
25 would have won.
25 would have been the closest,

01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:34.045
and what would they have won?
They would have won five bucks

01:05:34.045 --> 01:05:40.670
minus five cents for a total of
four ninety-five.

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:44.630
Now to make this interesting,
let's play this for real.

01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:48.901
So this of course relies on me
having brought some money and

01:05:48.901 --> 01:05:53.099
we'll have to do this without
dislodging the microphone.

01:05:53.099 --> 01:05:55.480
So I'm going to see if I
have… sorry about that.

01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.379
I'm going to see if I have
enough money to do this in class

01:05:57.379 --> 01:05:59.881
for real.
When we played this game in the

01:05:59.881 --> 01:06:03.820
old days, during the dot com
boom with the MBA students,

01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:06.643
you had to put fifty dollars on
the table to get them

01:06:06.643 --> 01:06:08.926
interested.
Graduate students:

01:06:08.926 --> 01:06:12.619
five cents will do it.
Okay, so this is a--there's

01:06:12.619 --> 01:06:14.920
some bloke with a beard on this
one.

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:18.500
Yeah this is Lincoln apparently.
Who knew, Lincoln?

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:21.763
Okay, so this is a five-dollar
note and I'm going to put

01:06:21.763 --> 01:06:25.620
it--sorry about that again--I'm
going to put it in an envelope.

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:30.219
I'm not cheating anybody?
No magic tricks here.

01:06:30.219 --> 01:06:35.082
And this is going to be the
prize for this game and we

01:06:35.082 --> 01:06:38.659
better give this to someone we
trust.

01:06:38.659 --> 01:06:47.680
It's the prize for 159.Who do
you guys trust?

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.323
The camera guy.
Okay Jude: we know Jude's going

01:06:50.323 --> 01:06:52.420
to be there next week.
I'm giving it to Jude.

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:54.648
You can't see this on
camera.--people at home--but I'm

01:06:54.648 --> 01:06:57.586
giving it to Jude okay.
I'm going to put it here,

01:06:57.586 --> 01:07:01.360
and Jude has to show up next
week with the prize.

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.818
I thought we should give it to
the guy at the back,

01:07:02.818 --> 01:07:05.240
who is the moral guy.
Who is our moral guy at the

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:06.223
back?
Well never mind,

01:07:06.223 --> 01:07:08.309
we will give it to Jude.
We know Jude's going to be here.

01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:09.970
All right, has everyone put a
number down?

01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:12.550
Any questions?
Just shout them out to me.

01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:14.292
Student: So given that
we only have one five dollar

01:07:14.292 --> 01:07:15.730
bill does there have to be one
unique winner,

01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:17.558
and if so, how is that
determined if we have multiple

01:07:17.558 --> 01:07:19.562
people who are - Professor
Ben Polak: That's a good

01:07:19.562 --> 01:07:21.241
question.
If there's multiple winners,

01:07:21.241 --> 01:07:23.770
we'll divide it but we'll make
sure everyone has a positive

01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:26.179
winning.
Good question.

01:07:26.179 --> 01:07:28.417
Given the number of people in
the room there may be multiple

01:07:28.417 --> 01:07:29.820
winners, I accept that
possibility.

01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:31.880
Has everyone written down a
number now?

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:35.413
All right, so hand your numbers
to the end of the row,

01:07:35.413 --> 01:07:37.511
but don't go yet.
Hand it on to the end of the

01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:39.969
row.
Before you go I want five

01:07:39.969 --> 01:07:44.091
things from you.
I want to know the five lessons

01:07:44.091 --> 01:07:47.170
from this class.
Tell me what you learnt?

01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:50.192
What were the five lessons?
Without looking at your notes,

01:07:50.192 --> 01:07:52.648
what were the five lessons?
Anybody, shout out one of the

01:07:52.648 --> 01:07:54.473
lessons, yes madam.
Student: Don't play a

01:07:54.473 --> 01:07:56.265
strictly dominated strategy.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:07:56.265 --> 01:07:58.620
Don't play a strictly dominated
strategy, anything else?

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:00.028
Yes sir.
Student: Yale students

01:08:00.028 --> 01:08:00.904
are evil.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:08:00.904 --> 01:08:03.700
Yale students are evil.
Two lessons down, three to go.

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:05.782
The guy over here.
Student: Rational

01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:06.820
choices can lead to bad
outcomes.

01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:09.812
Professor Ben Polak:
Rational choices can lead to bad

01:08:09.812 --> 01:08:11.300
outcomes.
We put it more graphically

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:13.420
before but that's fine.
Two more outcomes.

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:15.269
Student: Put yourself in
other people's shoes.

01:08:15.269 --> 01:08:17.616
Professor Ben Polak: Put
yourself in other people's shoes

01:08:17.616 --> 01:08:19.404
and I'm missing one,
I can't recall which one I'm

01:08:19.404 --> 01:08:20.500
missing now.
Student: You can't get

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:21.414
what you want so you -
Professor Ben Polak: You

01:08:21.414 --> 01:08:23.220
can't get what you want.
You could but it's a good idea

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:25.812
to figure out what you want
before you try and get what you

01:08:25.812 --> 01:08:28.191
want.
Five things you learnt today,

01:08:28.191 --> 01:08:32.303
hand in your numbers and the
legal forms and I'll see you on

01:08:32.303 --> 01:08:33.303
Monday.

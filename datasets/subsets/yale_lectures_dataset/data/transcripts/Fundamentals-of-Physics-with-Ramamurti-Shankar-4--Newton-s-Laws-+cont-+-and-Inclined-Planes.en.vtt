00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.797
I would ideally like to have a
class with maybe just ten

00:00:08.797 --> 00:00:11.849
students so that we can have a
lot of dialogue and I can find

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.460
out what you're thinking about,
address your questions.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.344
That'll make a lot of fun but
that's not possible in an

00:00:19.344 --> 00:00:22.723
introductory course.
But I think you should feel

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:26.640
free to interrupt or ask
questions or discuss any

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.640
reasonably related issue that I
didn't get to.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.155
Okay?
But that'll make it interesting

00:00:33.155 --> 00:00:36.786
for everybody because I told you
many times the subject is not

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:39.280
new to me.
It's probably--it's new to you.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.623
So what makes it interesting
for me is the fact that it's a

00:00:42.623 --> 00:00:46.082
different class with a different
set of people with different

00:00:46.082 --> 00:00:47.757
questions.
And trust me,

00:00:47.757 --> 00:00:51.558
your ability to surprise me is
limitless because even on a

00:00:51.558 --> 00:00:55.160
subject which I thought is
firmly fixed in my mind,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.594
some of you guys come up with
some point of view or some

00:00:58.594 --> 00:01:01.280
question that's always of
interest to me,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.194
of people who've been
practicing this business for a

00:01:04.194 --> 00:01:06.404
long time.
So I welcome that,

00:01:06.404 --> 00:01:09.200
and that'll make it more
lively.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.255
All right, so I think last time
I got off on a rant about all

00:01:14.255 --> 00:01:18.637
the different pedagogical
techniques, some of which I

00:01:18.637 --> 00:01:22.658
don't endorse fully.
I'm going to go back now 300

00:01:22.658 --> 00:01:25.584
years in time,
to one of the greatest laws

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:29.224
that we have because--look at
the power of this law,

00:01:29.224 --> 00:01:31.948
right?
Here is the equation,

00:01:31.948 --> 00:01:36.008
and all the mechanical
phenomena that we see,

00:01:36.008 --> 00:01:40.069
around the world,
can be understood with this

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:42.560
law.
And I was starting to give you

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.879
examples on how to put this law
to work, because I think I at

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:49.144
least made you realize that
simply writing down the law does

00:01:49.144 --> 00:01:52.519
not give you a good feeling for
how you actually use it.

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:56.751
So, maybe you have understood
it, but I'm going to remind you

00:01:56.751 --> 00:02:00.629
one more time on how you're
supposed to use this law.

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:03.019
So, I'm going to take a
concrete example.

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:06.440
The use of any law of physics
is to be able to predict

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.795
something about the future,
given something about the

00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:12.451
present.
So, all problems that we solve

00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:15.942
can be categorized that way.
So I'm going to take a very

00:02:15.942 --> 00:02:18.421
simple problem,
a problem to which I will

00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:22.184
return in great detail later on;
but let me first start

00:02:22.184 --> 00:02:26.314
with--let me start with this
problem, which I will do very

00:02:26.314 --> 00:02:30.879
quickly now and we'll come back
and do it more slowly later.

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.670
But at least it's a concrete
problem.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.806
The problem looks like this.
So, here is a table and here's

00:02:36.806 --> 00:02:40.039
a spring and here's the mass
m.

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:42.569
There's a force constant
k.

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.382
I want to pull it by some
amount A,

00:02:47.382 --> 00:02:51.752
and let it go.
So that's the knowledge of the

00:02:51.752 --> 00:02:53.678
present.
The question is,

00:02:53.678 --> 00:02:57.139
when I let it go,
what's this guy going to do?

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.160
That's the typical physics
problem.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.909
It can get more and more
complex.

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.000
You can replace the mass by a
planet;

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.527
you can replace the spring by
the Sun, which is attracting the

00:03:05.527 --> 00:03:07.098
planet;
you can put many planets,

00:03:07.098 --> 00:03:09.159
you can make it more and more
complicated.

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.419
But they all boil down to a
similar situation.

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.897
I know some information now and
I want to be able to say what'll

00:03:14.897 --> 00:03:17.072
happen next.
So, here I pull the mass,

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:20.439
when I want A and I want
to know what'll it do next.

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.098
Remember, when we go back to
the laws of Newton,

00:03:24.098 --> 00:03:28.769
the laws of Newton only tell
you this--and we've been talking

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.650
about this is useful
information.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.485
The first thing you have to
know in order to use the laws of

00:03:35.485 --> 00:03:39.190
Newton, you have to separately
know the left-hand side.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.810
You have to know what force is
going to act on a body.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.008
You cannot simply say,
"Oh, I know the force on the

00:03:45.008 --> 00:03:46.680
body, it is m times
a;

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.810
ma is not a force acting
on a body;

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.250
a is the response to a
force;

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.830
you got to have some other
means of finding the force.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.450
And in this case,
the force on the mass is due to

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.069
the spring.
So, I pull the spring by

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.889
various amounts and I see what
force it exerts.

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.302
Now, I think you know now in
practice how I know what force

00:04:07.302 --> 00:04:09.941
it exerts, right?
I pull it by some amount,

00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:12.680
attach, say,
the one kilogram standard mass.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.442
I see what acceleration it
experiences, and m times

00:04:16.442 --> 00:04:19.479
that acceleration,
or 1 times the acceleration,

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.464
is the force the spring exerts.
So I pull it by various amounts

00:04:23.464 --> 00:04:25.933
and I study the spring.
And I've learned,

00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:29.383
by studying the spring,
that the force it exerts is

00:04:29.383 --> 00:04:32.511
some number k,
called a force constant,

00:04:32.511 --> 00:04:34.779
times the amount by which I
pull it.

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:38.759
If I start off the mass in a
position where the spring is

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.951
neither expanded nor contracted,
that's what we like to call

00:04:42.951 --> 00:04:46.591
x = 0.
So I pulled it to x =

00:04:46.591 --> 00:04:49.089
A.
Now, what I'm told is when you

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:52.186
pull it to any point x,
that's the force the spring

00:04:52.186 --> 00:04:54.720
exerts.
So, this is part of an

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.013
independent study.
People who work in spring

00:04:58.013 --> 00:05:01.790
physics will study springs and
they will find out from you,

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.442
find out and tell you that any
time you buy a spring from me

00:05:05.442 --> 00:05:08.149
it'll exert this force.
And they have done--they

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:10.903
figured that out by pulling the
spring and attaching it to

00:05:10.903 --> 00:05:13.850
various entities and seeing what
acceleration it produces.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.228
There, the masses are taken to
be known, because you can always

00:05:17.228 --> 00:05:19.790
borrow the mass from the Bureau
of Standards,

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.866
or we discussed last time how
if you have an unknown mass you

00:05:23.866 --> 00:05:28.350
can then compare it to this mass
and find out what its value is.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.480
So every object's mass can be
measured.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.627
And then the guys making the
spring have studied what it does

00:05:34.627 --> 00:05:37.600
to different masses and figured
this out.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.046
Now, you come with this mass
and you say, what happens when I

00:05:42.046 --> 00:05:44.466
connect it?
Well, I'm assuming the mass of

00:05:44.466 --> 00:05:47.428
this guy can also be found by
comparisons, the way I described

00:05:47.428 --> 00:05:49.912
to you last time.
So we can always find a mass of

00:05:49.912 --> 00:05:52.060
any object, as we went into in
some length.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.708
Then, Newton's law says this is
equal to ma,

00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:57.621
but I want to write a as
the second derivative of

00:05:57.621 --> 00:05:58.310
x.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.518
So, you now go from a physical
law, which is really a

00:06:07.518 --> 00:06:10.747
postulate.
There is no way to derive F

00:06:10.747 --> 00:06:13.911
= ma.
You cannot just think about it

00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:16.381
and get it.
So, whenever I do physics I

00:06:16.381 --> 00:06:18.550
will sometimes tell you this is
a law;

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.100
that means don't even try to
derive it.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.613
It just summarizes everything
we know in terms of some new

00:06:24.613 --> 00:06:28.075
terms, but it cannot be deduced.
On the other hand,

00:06:28.075 --> 00:06:32.628
the fate of this mass can now
be deduced by applying Newton's

00:06:32.628 --> 00:06:36.137
law to this equation.
Now, this is a new equation,

00:06:36.137 --> 00:06:38.790
you may not have seen this
equation before.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.557
For example,
if I told you -- forget the

00:06:41.557 --> 00:06:45.601
left-hand side -- if I told you
the right-hand side is 96,

00:06:45.601 --> 00:06:49.220
I think you guys know how to
solve that, right?

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.979
You have to find a function
whose second derivative is 96

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:54.246
divided by m,
and you all know how to do

00:06:54.246 --> 00:06:55.756
that;
it's t^(2) times a

00:06:55.756 --> 00:06:57.890
number, and you can fudge the
number so it works.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.233
This is more complicated.
The time derivative of this

00:07:01.233 --> 00:07:05.398
unknown function is not a given
number but the unknown function

00:07:05.398 --> 00:07:06.981
itself;
in other words,

00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:09.350
x itself is a function
of time.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.970
This is called a differential
equation.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.019
A differential equation is an
equation that tells you

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:18.951
something about an unknown
function in terms of its

00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:21.052
derivatives.
You can have a differential

00:07:21.052 --> 00:07:23.290
equation involving the second
derivative or the first

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.829
derivative or the fourteenth
derivative, whatever it is.

00:07:25.829 --> 00:07:28.750
You are supposed to find out
what x (t) is,

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.973
given this information.
So, one thing is,

00:07:30.973 --> 00:07:32.743
you can go to the Math
Department and say,

00:07:32.743 --> 00:07:35.160
"Hey look, I got this equation,
what's the solution?"

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.843
and they will tell you.
Now, sometimes we have to do

00:07:38.843 --> 00:07:43.350
our own work and we can solve
this equation by guessing.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.693
In fact, the only way to solve
a differential equation is by

00:07:46.693 --> 00:07:49.350
guessing the answer;
there is no other way.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.681
You can make a lot of guesses
and every time it works you keep

00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:54.480
a little table;
then you publish it,

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.959
called Table of
Integrals.

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:59.255
So, I have in my office a huge
table, Mark Caprio has got his

00:07:59.255 --> 00:08:01.672
own integral,
we don't leave home without our

00:08:01.672 --> 00:08:04.412
Table of Integrals.
I got one at home,

00:08:04.412 --> 00:08:07.264
I got one at work,
I may want to keep one in the

00:08:07.264 --> 00:08:11.270
car because you just don't know
when you will need an integral.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.778
Okay?
So people have tabulated them

00:08:13.778 --> 00:08:17.350
over hundreds of years.
But how do they find them?

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.064
They're going to find them in
the way I'm going to describe to

00:08:20.064 --> 00:08:22.587
you now.
You look at the equation and

00:08:22.587 --> 00:08:26.432
you guess the answer.
Let's make our life simple by

00:08:26.432 --> 00:08:30.169
taking a case where the forced
constant is just 1,

00:08:30.169 --> 00:08:32.391
okay?
It takes 1 Newton per meter to

00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:35.437
stretch that spring.
I let the mass of the object be

00:08:35.437 --> 00:08:37.416
1 kilogram.
This is just to keep the

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:39.306
algebra simple.
Later on, you can put any

00:08:39.306 --> 00:08:41.270
m and k,
and we'll do all that.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:45.509
Then what am I saying?
I'm saying, find me a function

00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:49.379
whose second derivative is minus
that function.

00:08:49.379 --> 00:08:53.526
Now, as a word problem maybe it
rings a bell,

00:08:53.526 --> 00:08:55.950
right?
Do you know such a function?

00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:02.042
Student: Exponential.
Professor Ramamurti

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:02.650
Shankar: Exponential is
good.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:04.299
Another one?
Yes?

00:09:04.299 --> 00:09:05.509
Student: Any trig
functions.

00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:06.282
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Trigonometric

00:09:06.282 --> 00:09:08.494
functions are good.
So I'm going to temporarily

00:09:08.494 --> 00:09:11.549
dismiss the exponential.
I will tell you why.

00:09:11.549 --> 00:09:14.090
An exponential function is
actually a very good guess.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.980
You can say x = e^(t),
for example.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.929
The trouble is,
this is growing exponentially,

00:09:20.929 --> 00:09:24.535
and we know this spring mass
system, the x is not

00:09:24.535 --> 00:09:27.037
growing exponentially.
Or you might say,

00:09:27.037 --> 00:09:29.429
well, let me fix that by making
it minus t;

00:09:29.429 --> 00:09:32.769
then it quickly comes to rest
after a time and doesn't move.

00:09:32.769 --> 00:09:35.922
We sort of feel we want this
thing to be jiggling around for

00:09:35.922 --> 00:09:39.117
a long time.
So, the exponential function is

00:09:39.117 --> 00:09:42.748
even better than this function
because it says,

00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:46.380
take one derivative and I
reproduce myself.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.132
But that's too much;
we only want a function that

00:09:49.132 --> 00:09:51.184
reproduces itself when you take
two derivatives,

00:09:51.184 --> 00:09:53.629
and that's where the
trigonometric functions come in.

00:09:53.629 --> 00:09:57.095
So, I make a guess,
x (t) is cos t,

00:09:57.095 --> 00:10:00.559
and you can check if you take
two derivatives,

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:03.255
it obeys the equation,
the second derivative of

00:10:03.255 --> 00:10:08.436
x is –x itself.
But do I like this solution or

00:10:08.436 --> 00:10:13.090
is there something not fully
satisfactory?

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.416
Yes?
Student: But you can't

00:10:14.416 --> 00:10:15.446
help the negative when you
[inaudible]

00:10:15.446 --> 00:10:16.809
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Pardon me?

00:10:16.809 --> 00:10:19.525
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:10:19.525 --> 00:10:22.130
Shankar: Oh it will be
negative x.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:28.718
So, let's do that.
So let's take dx/dt = -sin

00:10:28.718 --> 00:10:32.914
(t).
Then, take one more derivative,

00:10:32.914 --> 00:10:37.779
d²x over dt²,
derivative of sine is cosine.

00:10:37.779 --> 00:10:42.667
So, if this is –cos
(t), but x was cos

00:10:42.667 --> 00:10:44.889
(t);
so it's really minus of the

00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:48.220
x I started with.
Yes?

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.824
So you have a question or--?
Student: I was thinking,

00:10:51.824 --> 00:10:53.171
you wrote it up there
[inaudible]

00:10:53.171 --> 00:10:54.770
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Oh,

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.379
this one?
Student: Yes.

00:10:56.379 --> 00:10:57.460
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Caught on film.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.900
Yes, that's a mistake.
Okay?

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.279
That should be minus.
Very good.

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:07.169
Look, it makes me immensely
happy when you guys catch me.

00:11:07.169 --> 00:11:09.460
Of course, it becomes an
addiction, you try to catch me;

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.879
sometimes it doesn't work,
but keep trying.

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:13.129
This time you're absolutely
right.

00:11:13.129 --> 00:11:15.700
That's why you were looking
confused.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.151
Anything else?
Everyone follow the way this

00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:23.940
very elementary problem is
solved?

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.539
It's solved by making a guess.
So, you're right.

00:11:27.539 --> 00:11:29.629
So, the minus sign was wrong
but now you agree everything's

00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:31.220
working.
This is the answer.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.210
But no, I meant something else
is not quite okay with this.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.256
Yes?
Student: Your function

00:11:36.256 --> 00:11:38.759
also works if you added a factor
of the sine, also?

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:39.210
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.456
But first of all,
I can add some sin (t)

00:11:41.456 --> 00:11:43.997
and it'll still work.
But more importantly,

00:11:43.997 --> 00:11:46.899
if I put t = 0,
I get x = 1.

00:11:46.899 --> 00:11:50.860
Why should it be true that I
pulled it by exactly one meter?

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.259
I could have pulled it by 2 or
3 or 9 meters.

00:11:53.259 --> 00:11:57.041
I want to be able to tell how
much I pulled it by at t

00:11:57.041 --> 00:11:58.908
= 0.
Suppose it was pulled to 5

00:11:58.908 --> 00:12:02.250
meters and released.
I want x (0) to be 5.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.846
The point is,
you can easily fix that,

00:12:04.846 --> 00:12:09.399
by putting a 5 here.
Does it screw up everything?

00:12:09.399 --> 00:12:11.946
It doesn't because the 5 just
comes along for the ride,

00:12:11.946 --> 00:12:14.646
everywhere.
And don't think it's 5x,

00:12:14.646 --> 00:12:17.070
because this 5 is part of
x.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.723
So you can multiply your answer
by any number you like,

00:12:20.723 --> 00:12:24.309
and you pick that number,
that reproduces your initial

00:12:24.309 --> 00:12:26.927
displacement.
So if you pulled it by 5,

00:12:26.927 --> 00:12:29.828
you put a 5.
So, now we're very happy to

00:12:29.828 --> 00:12:33.071
describe this problem.
It is true, you can put sin

00:12:33.071 --> 00:12:35.345
(t) but I will,
in this problem we don't need

00:12:35.345 --> 00:12:37.041
it.
Here's an answer that does

00:12:37.041 --> 00:12:40.201
everything you want it to do.
At the initial time,

00:12:40.201 --> 00:12:43.799
it gives you 5 times cos
0, which is 5;

00:12:43.799 --> 00:12:45.970
and that's what you told me was
the initial displacement.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.370
Initial velocity,
if you take a dx/dt,

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.315
it's proportional to sin
(t) and a t = 0,

00:12:51.315 --> 00:12:53.170
that vanishes,
that's correct;

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.934
you pulled it and you let it go.
So, the instant you released

00:12:55.934 --> 00:12:59.872
it, it had no velocity.
And it satisfies Newton's laws,

00:12:59.872 --> 00:13:04.015
and that's your answer.
I want to do this simple

00:13:04.015 --> 00:13:08.320
example in totality because this
is the paradigm.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.140
This is the example after which
everything else is modeled.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.654
Yes?
Student: How do you know

00:13:14.654 --> 00:13:17.940
that it's not sin (t) at
the end?

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:18.659
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Ah.

00:13:18.659 --> 00:13:21.093
You need a t = 0,
if the answer was sin

00:13:21.093 --> 00:13:23.113
(t);
well sin (t) vanishes a

00:13:23.113 --> 00:13:25.948
t = 0.
And cos (t), it doesn't

00:13:25.948 --> 00:13:29.762
vanish, has a robust value of 1.
But I want a value of 5,

00:13:29.762 --> 00:13:32.423
I put a 5 in front.
Look, you guys may have a few

00:13:32.423 --> 00:13:35.388
more things to say about this
problem because this is not the

00:13:35.388 --> 00:13:37.860
final and most general solution
to the problem.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.867
It is a solution that certainly
works for the one example I had,

00:13:41.867 --> 00:13:45.430
which is a mass being pulled to
5 meters and released.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:50.102
So, carry this in your mind.
This is really to me the most

00:13:50.102 --> 00:13:52.539
important thing I can tell you
right now.

00:13:52.539 --> 00:13:56.096
The way F = ma is
applied in real life is half the

00:13:56.096 --> 00:13:58.700
world is working on the
left-hand side,

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:03.049
finding the forces that act on
bodies under various conditions.

00:14:03.049 --> 00:14:05.586
In this example,
the force is due to a spring

00:14:05.586 --> 00:14:09.104
and by playing with a spring you
can study the force it exerts

00:14:09.104 --> 00:14:12.332
the various displacements of
various amounts by which you

00:14:12.332 --> 00:14:14.814
pull it,
and in this example if you pull

00:14:14.814 --> 00:14:17.623
the spring by an amount
x, it exerts the force

00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:19.742
-kx,
and you can measure k

00:14:19.742 --> 00:14:22.663
and you put the label on your
product and you sell the spring

00:14:22.663 --> 00:14:25.450
with a given k.
Other people are measuring

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:29.136
masses of various objects and
they've decided the mass of this

00:14:29.136 --> 00:14:33.402
is whatever, maybe 1 kilogram.
You put the two sides together

00:14:33.402 --> 00:14:38.100
and you find the response of the
system for all future times.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.179
And what this tells you then,
you can now plot this.

00:14:41.179 --> 00:14:43.269
This is a graph that looks like
this;

00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:47.429
it goes from 5 to -5 and
repeats itself and it's very

00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:49.638
nice.
That's what we think the spring

00:14:49.638 --> 00:14:52.508
would do.
Now, you think this is a real

00:14:52.508 --> 00:14:55.250
spring or am I missing
something?

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.669
This is the whole story?
Yes?

00:14:59.669 --> 00:15:00.980
Student: There's
friction.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.381
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: There's friction

00:15:02.381 --> 00:15:03.975
because we know if you pull a
real spring it's not going to

00:15:03.975 --> 00:15:05.830
oscillate forever.
It's going to slowly stop

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.730
shaking and pretty much come to
rest.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.909
That just means--Who do you
want to blame for this equation?

00:15:10.909 --> 00:15:13.402
Do we conclude now there's
something wrong with Newton's

00:15:13.402 --> 00:15:15.919
laws?
Or what's the problem?

00:15:15.919 --> 00:15:17.568
Student: The k
coefficients should not be

00:15:17.568 --> 00:15:18.575
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:15:18.575 --> 00:15:20.805
Shankar: Pardon me?
Student: The k

00:15:20.805 --> 00:15:22.539
coefficient is wrong.
Professor Ramamurti

00:15:22.539 --> 00:15:23.940
Shankar: The fault is not
with the k.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.714
Yes?
Student: We didn't take

00:15:25.714 --> 00:15:27.514
into account all the force
that's friction and the amount

00:15:27.514 --> 00:15:28.170
of force.
Professor Ramamurti

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.639
Shankar: That is correct.
So, we will say we have missed

00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:32.980
something.
There's another force acting on

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:36.271
this mass, besides the spring;
that's the force of friction

00:15:36.271 --> 00:15:38.669
that'll oppose the motion of the
mass.

00:15:38.669 --> 00:15:40.840
So, you can say one of two
things.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.492
Either you can say something is
wrong with Newton's laws,

00:15:43.492 --> 00:15:46.049
or you can say we've not
applied Newton's laws properly

00:15:46.049 --> 00:15:48.370
because we haven't identified
all the forces.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:52.257
So, if you never knew about
friction, you do this and you

00:15:52.257 --> 00:15:55.477
find, hey, it doesn't work.
The mass comes to rest,

00:15:55.477 --> 00:15:58.260
whereas the theory says it
should oscillate forever.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.782
So, you are at the fork.
Either you can say Newton's

00:16:01.782 --> 00:16:04.010
laws are right;
I'm missing some forces,

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.440
I'm going to look around and
find out what they are.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.500
Then, you will derive friction
from that.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.830
Or maybe it's time to give up
Newton's laws.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:13.080
It turns out,
even if there is no friction

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.330
this is not the correct law of
physics.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.674
The correct law is given by
Einstein's relativistic

00:16:18.674 --> 00:16:21.399
dynamics.
This does not satisfy the

00:16:21.399 --> 00:16:24.278
relativistic dynamics;
by that I mean,

00:16:24.278 --> 00:16:28.264
if you really pull a real mass
by 5 meters or whatever and

00:16:28.264 --> 00:16:32.320
release it, its motion will not
be exactly what I said;

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.638
or it'll be off by a very,
very, very tiny amount that you

00:16:35.638 --> 00:16:38.549
probably will not discover in
most laboratories.

00:16:38.549 --> 00:16:41.946
But if the mass begins to move
at a velocity that is comparable

00:16:41.946 --> 00:16:44.302
to that of light,
then this equation will be

00:16:44.302 --> 00:16:45.684
wrong.
So, people say,

00:16:45.684 --> 00:16:47.799
oh, what kind of business are
you in?

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:49.800
Every once in a while somebody
is wrong.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.534
I'll tell you right now.
Everything we know is wrong,

00:16:52.534 --> 00:16:54.090
you know?
And it's no secret;

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.226
you can publish it,
you can tell the whole world,

00:16:56.226 --> 00:16:58.230
this practitioner said
everything is wrong.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:00.330
But it's wrong in this limited
sense.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:03.620
Is Newton right or wrong?
Well, Newton didn't try to

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.990
describe things moving at speeds
comparable to light.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.619
He dealt with what problem he
could deal with at that time.

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:11.940
So, it's a law that has a
limited domain of validity.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.430
You can always push the
frontiers of observation until

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.920
you come to a situation where
the law doesn't work.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.170
But the specialty of relativity
doesn't also work all the time.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.447
If the mass becomes very tiny,
it becomes of atomic

00:17:24.447 --> 00:17:27.090
dimensions, then you need the
laws of quantum mechanics.

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:30.593
That's wrong too.
So, things work in a certain

00:17:30.593 --> 00:17:34.080
domain and sometimes you abandon
the formalism;

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.715
but don't rush to do that.
In this case,

00:17:36.715 --> 00:17:39.700
the problem is not with
formalism but due to friction.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.089
So, you have to make sure you
got all the forces.

00:17:42.089 --> 00:17:44.411
Once you got all the forces,
it still doesn't work,

00:17:44.411 --> 00:17:46.685
then of course the
experimentalists are very happy

00:17:46.685 --> 00:17:49.099
because there's something wrong
with the theory;

00:17:49.099 --> 00:17:52.590
then you got to find the new
theory, till that works.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:56.809
Okay, so that's the cycle.
So it's an ongoing process;

00:17:56.809 --> 00:17:58.519
physics is still a work in
progress.

00:17:58.519 --> 00:18:01.140
This is work as of 300 years
ago.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.482
And no one's found anything
wrong with Newton's laws,

00:18:04.482 --> 00:18:07.309
provided you don't violate two
conditions.

00:18:07.309 --> 00:18:10.669
You don't deal with objects
moving at speeds comparable to

00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:13.321
that of light,
and you don't deal with objects

00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:15.089
which are very,
very tiny.

00:18:15.089 --> 00:18:17.890
The notion of what's very tiny
will be very clear when you

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:19.660
learn quantum mechanics next
term.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.959
Right now, there is something
rough, called "tiny," there's

00:18:22.959 --> 00:18:26.059
things like atomic dimensions.
All right.

00:18:26.059 --> 00:18:30.380
So now we are going to do more
concrete problems,

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:35.059
but I wanted to write that up
for you as a simple,

00:18:35.059 --> 00:18:38.726
solvable, worked out -- an
example that displays everything

00:18:38.726 --> 00:18:43.009
that happens in physics.
All right.

00:18:43.009 --> 00:18:45.022
So, by the way,
people are always looking for

00:18:45.022 --> 00:18:46.670
new forces, the electrical
forces.

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:50.549
You find a charge on a table,
it's not connected to a spring;

00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:53.453
I bring another charge next to
it, in this case it starts

00:18:53.453 --> 00:18:55.559
moving.
What do I do?

00:18:55.559 --> 00:18:58.997
A body accelerating without any
force… I can say Newton is

00:18:58.997 --> 00:19:02.551
wrong or I can say maybe there's
a new force between that body

00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:04.820
and this body,
and that will turn out to be

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.478
the electrical force.
Electrical force occurs

00:19:07.478 --> 00:19:11.687
whenever you take something,
you take a cat and you take a

00:19:11.687 --> 00:19:15.023
piece of amber or you rub it,
you do various things,

00:19:15.023 --> 00:19:17.768
then you put them next to other
things and they're attracted or

00:19:17.768 --> 00:19:19.450
repelled,
and you discover you're

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.750
charging things,
and that's how electricity was

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:24.138
discovered.
But you don't have to have a

00:19:24.138 --> 00:19:25.514
cat;
if you have a buffalo,

00:19:25.514 --> 00:19:27.859
you can take it with a buffalo,
it still works.

00:19:27.859 --> 00:19:30.881
Then, you got to find out what
you really need to find electric

00:19:30.881 --> 00:19:32.571
forces.
But you find there is a new

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:35.259
force and you know you've got a
whole new force to study;

00:19:35.259 --> 00:19:37.859
then you got to find out what's
the cause of the force.

00:19:37.859 --> 00:19:39.598
It turns out,
it's not the mass of the

00:19:39.598 --> 00:19:42.089
object, it's something else
called electric charge.

00:19:42.089 --> 00:19:44.279
Then, how does the force vary
with distance?

00:19:44.279 --> 00:19:47.210
Well, it varies like
1/r².

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.643
You know that.
So that's how you slowly study

00:19:49.643 --> 00:19:53.429
and identify new forces.
So, the forces were found in

00:19:53.429 --> 00:19:57.670
the order of gravitation first,
and then electricity,

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.927
magnetism and now of course
there are new forces called

00:19:59.927 --> 00:20:01.829
"strong forces."
There are weak forces.

00:20:01.829 --> 00:20:03.609
They all act on the subnuclear
level;

00:20:03.609 --> 00:20:06.490
so that's why that business is
not done.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.579
We are not finished with the
left-hand side.

00:20:08.579 --> 00:20:10.500
We're still looking for new
forces.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:15.884
Okay, so now I'm going to start
doing problems in two

00:20:15.884 --> 00:20:18.880
dimensions.
Everything I did last time was

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.275
1D.
You're pulling something,

00:20:20.275 --> 00:20:22.861
you're pushing something,
you got one block connected to

00:20:22.861 --> 00:20:25.260
a second block to a third block
and you pull it.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.817
We're done all that.
So we're going to elevate this

00:20:27.817 --> 00:20:29.908
to high dimensions.
And as you know,

00:20:29.908 --> 00:20:32.764
in high dimensions,
acceleration is a vector,

00:20:32.764 --> 00:20:36.724
and so force better be a vector
because when you take a vector

00:20:36.724 --> 00:20:40.359
and multiply it by a number you
get something else.

00:20:40.359 --> 00:20:43.365
And there, by that process,
you've gone to higher

00:20:43.365 --> 00:20:47.026
dimensions.
So let's take again simple

00:20:47.026 --> 00:20:52.829
problems and try to make them
more and more complex.

00:20:52.829 --> 00:20:56.474
And you cannot tell me
eventually you agree the problem

00:20:56.474 --> 00:20:59.714
is complex enough,
or I will crank it up as we go

00:20:59.714 --> 00:21:02.001
along.
If at some point you plead for

00:21:02.001 --> 00:21:04.664
mercy, then we'll stop.
But there is no limit to how

00:21:04.664 --> 00:21:06.480
difficult mechanics problems can
be.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.414
If you go back and read
Cambridge University exams,

00:21:09.414 --> 00:21:11.997
in 1600 and 1700,
there were really difficult

00:21:11.997 --> 00:21:14.027
problems.
That's why they invented

00:21:14.027 --> 00:21:16.349
quantum mechanics,
which is a lot easier than

00:21:16.349 --> 00:21:18.619
those problems from Newtonian
mechanics.

00:21:18.619 --> 00:21:20.069
You can make it as hard as you
like.

00:21:20.069 --> 00:21:23.894
So, I'm just going to do a few,
then once you got the idea,

00:21:23.894 --> 00:21:26.250
you stop.
But again, we're going to start

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.471
with easy one.
Easy one is a table on which

00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:33.640
this mass is sitting,
doing absolutely nothing.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.084
And we want to study that guy
and understand it in terms of

00:21:38.084 --> 00:21:40.603
Newton's laws.
Because we're in two

00:21:40.603 --> 00:21:43.059
dimensions, you got to have two
axes.

00:21:43.059 --> 00:21:45.779
So here is my x and here
is my y.

00:21:45.779 --> 00:21:53.279
So, the first rule is if F =
ma, we're really saying

00:21:53.279 --> 00:21:59.873
i times fx +
j times fy,

00:21:59.873 --> 00:22:06.980
is miax + mjay.
It's a vector equation.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.470
The force has to be a
combination of i and

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.272
j because nobody--By the
way, I'm working in the

00:22:12.272 --> 00:22:14.863
xy plane.
I told you I don't need to go

00:22:14.863 --> 00:22:17.297
to 3D, for a long time.
In 3D, in every vector there's

00:22:17.297 --> 00:22:19.248
some amount of i and some
amount of j,

00:22:19.248 --> 00:22:21.084
that's, what's true for
f, that's true for

00:22:21.084 --> 00:22:22.650
a.
You write it out.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.295
And I told you,
if two vectors are equal,

00:22:25.295 --> 00:22:29.131
then the x components
have to match and the y

00:22:29.131 --> 00:22:33.259
parts also have to match.
You can see that.

00:22:33.259 --> 00:22:35.826
If I draw two arrows on the
plane and I tell you this arrow

00:22:35.826 --> 00:22:37.730
is the same as that arrow,
it's the same.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.680
It's got the same horizontal
part and the same vertical part.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.026
So, this is really two
equations, and I'm going to

00:22:44.026 --> 00:22:48.192
apply them to this block.
So, when I look at this block,

00:22:48.192 --> 00:22:52.140
in the x direction,
it's not moving at all.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:57.181
There are no known forces
acting in the x

00:22:57.181 --> 00:23:02.330
direction, and therefore it's a
case of 0 = 0.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.200
Did I miss something?
You guys look a little worried.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.894
Yes?
Okay, now I look in the

00:23:09.894 --> 00:23:13.657
y direction.
If you look in the y

00:23:13.657 --> 00:23:17.199
direction, I take this block and
I draw its free body diagram,

00:23:17.199 --> 00:23:19.289
and I write all the forces on
it.

00:23:19.289 --> 00:23:23.299
So, there is the force of
gravity, mg;

00:23:23.299 --> 00:23:26.910
however, this M is a big
M or a small m?

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:29.265
Well, let's change the figure
to small m,

00:23:29.265 --> 00:23:31.569
so that the rest of the
equations are right.

00:23:31.569 --> 00:23:33.240
The little mg is acting
down.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.272
If that's all you had,
the block would fall through

00:23:36.272 --> 00:23:38.041
the table;
it's not doing that,

00:23:38.041 --> 00:23:40.230
so the table we know is
exerting a force.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:43.628
The standard name for that is
N, and N stands

00:23:43.628 --> 00:23:46.387
for normal.
And normal is a mathematical

00:23:46.387 --> 00:23:49.614
term for perpendicular.
You say this vector is normal

00:23:49.614 --> 00:23:51.390
with that vector,
you mean they are

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.688
perpendicular,
and here we mean this force is

00:23:53.688 --> 00:23:57.255
perpendicular to the table.
There are the forces in the

00:23:57.255 --> 00:24:00.743
y direction.
In the y direction,

00:24:00.743 --> 00:24:04.990
N is a positive force,
it's with a plus sign;

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:08.569
mg is a negative force,
and that's equal to m

00:24:08.569 --> 00:24:11.955
times ay.
It's interesting that in this

00:24:11.955 --> 00:24:16.585
application of the Newtonian
equation, I'm going to say that

00:24:16.585 --> 00:24:21.144
I know the right-hand side.
I know the right hand side is 0

00:24:21.144 --> 00:24:25.268
because I know this block is
neither sinking into the table

00:24:25.268 --> 00:24:28.319
nor flying off the table.
It's sitting on the table;

00:24:28.319 --> 00:24:30.633
it has no velocity,
it has no acceleration,

00:24:30.633 --> 00:24:33.237
vertically.
So that has to be 0 because I

00:24:33.237 --> 00:24:35.873
know the right-hand side.
So, in Newton's laws,

00:24:35.873 --> 00:24:38.435
quite often either I will know
the left or I will know the

00:24:38.435 --> 00:24:40.135
right;
either I will know the force or

00:24:40.135 --> 00:24:43.170
I will know the acceleration.
So, if this is 0,

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:47.359
I come to the conclusion N =
mg.

00:24:47.359 --> 00:24:52.113
This is a very simple example,
but this is how you figure out

00:24:52.113 --> 00:24:56.549
how the Newton's laws work in
this particular problem.

00:24:56.549 --> 00:25:01.547
Okay, now I'm ready to
introduce another force,

00:25:01.547 --> 00:25:05.349
and that's the force of
friction.

00:25:05.349 --> 00:25:11.209
As you all seem to be aware,
there is generally a force of

00:25:11.209 --> 00:25:16.759
friction between this mass
m, and this table.

00:25:16.759 --> 00:25:21.069
So, how do we learn there is a
force of friction?

00:25:21.069 --> 00:25:23.705
Suppose someone said,
how do you know there is

00:25:23.705 --> 00:25:25.880
friction?
Here is a mass.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.889
What experiment will you do
that tells you,

00:25:27.889 --> 00:25:30.089
hey, there is another force
called friction?

00:25:30.089 --> 00:25:33.580
Okay, anybody tell me something
you would do?

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.056
Yes?
Student: Maybe put the

00:25:36.056 --> 00:25:37.817
mass on an incline.
Professor Ramamurti

00:25:37.817 --> 00:25:39.410
Shankar: Okay,
but suppose it's on this table.

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:41.150
But you are around,
you can do what you want.

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:43.059
Yes?
Go ahead.

00:25:43.059 --> 00:25:45.612
Student: [inaudible]
constant v;

00:25:45.612 --> 00:25:47.938
in order to move with a
constant v,

00:25:47.938 --> 00:25:49.978
you'd have to apply force.
Professor Ramamurti

00:25:49.978 --> 00:25:50.976
Shankar: That's possible.
Student: But moving

00:25:50.976 --> 00:25:52.109
forward, over the constant
v, there's no force.

00:25:52.109 --> 00:25:53.657
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: That's a very good

00:25:53.657 --> 00:25:54.863
answer.
One answer is,

00:25:54.863 --> 00:25:58.366
you find that to keep it moving
at constant velocity,

00:25:58.366 --> 00:26:01.797
you have to apply a force.
That means the force you're

00:26:01.797 --> 00:26:03.877
applying is cancelled by
somebody else,

00:26:03.877 --> 00:26:05.738
because there is zero
acceleration,

00:26:05.738 --> 00:26:08.470
there's got to be zero force.
Yes?

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.323
Student: Just apply
force to it and push it on the

00:26:11.323 --> 00:26:14.483
table and it'll stop eventually,
and that's how you think there

00:26:14.483 --> 00:26:16.420
must be a force,
that's out there.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.069
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Very good.

00:26:17.069 --> 00:26:20.274
But even before that,
even before it starts moving,

00:26:20.274 --> 00:26:23.350
you find that if you push it,
it doesn't move.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.179
Right?
I try to push the podium,

00:26:26.179 --> 00:26:28.706
well, I don't know my own
strength, but I'm going to

00:26:28.706 --> 00:26:30.640
imagine, I push it,
it's not moving.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.900
But if I push hard enough it
will move.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.980
What's happening before it
moves?

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:37.195
I'm applying a force and I'm
getting nothing in return for

00:26:37.195 --> 00:26:39.133
it.
So I know there is another

00:26:39.133 --> 00:26:42.686
force opposing what I do,
and that's called a force of

00:26:42.686 --> 00:26:46.014
static friction.
So, static friction is when the

00:26:46.014 --> 00:26:49.189
body is not moving.
So, I'm applying a force

00:26:49.189 --> 00:26:52.750
F.
Let me give it some other name,

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:56.079
little f.
No, that's also bad.

00:26:56.079 --> 00:26:57.990
Little f was the name
for friction.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:03.400
So, I'm going to apply a force
called F_me.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.440
You can label these things any
way you like.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.693
Okay?
This particular notation has

00:27:08.693 --> 00:27:11.966
not caught on because people are
not as interested in what I

00:27:11.966 --> 00:27:14.830
think as I am.
But right now I'm going to call

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:17.300
it F sub-me.
I invite you to invent any

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.904
notation you want because
there's nothing sacred about a

00:27:19.904 --> 00:27:22.650
notation, at least I want to
convey to you that notion.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:24.504
So, I call it
F_me,

00:27:24.504 --> 00:27:27.207
I'm applying to the right,
then I know that it's not

00:27:27.207 --> 00:27:29.249
moving;
therefore, there has to be

00:27:29.249 --> 00:27:32.930
another force that cancels it.
But how much is the other force?

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:35.285
Yes?
Student: Equal to

00:27:35.285 --> 00:27:36.260
F_me.
Professor Ramamurti

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.690
Shankar: That's correct.
So, it is not a fixed force.

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:41.369
Static friction is not a fixed
force;

00:27:41.369 --> 00:27:43.549
it's whatever it takes to keep
it from moving.

00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:48.059
It will not be less than what I
apply, because then it'll move;

00:27:48.059 --> 00:27:50.556
it cannot be more than what I
apply because then it'll start

00:27:50.556 --> 00:27:53.476
moving backwards.
So, it will do what it takes to

00:27:53.476 --> 00:27:57.539
keep it from moving.
So, static friction is a force

00:27:57.539 --> 00:28:01.220
which has a range from 0 to some
maximum.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:06.889
So, let's call it the force of
friction is less than or equal

00:28:06.889 --> 00:28:11.392
to some maximum.
And that maximum turns out to

00:28:11.392 --> 00:28:16.417
be a number called the
coefficient of static friction

00:28:16.417 --> 00:28:21.526
times the normal force.
The force of friction seems to

00:28:21.526 --> 00:28:26.634
depend on how much normal force
the table is exerting on the

00:28:26.634 --> 00:28:28.790
object,
which in our example,

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:32.048
if you want in our example,
not always, this is always

00:28:32.048 --> 00:28:34.113
true,
but in our example you may

00:28:34.113 --> 00:28:36.533
replace it by
μ_s times

00:28:36.533 --> 00:28:40.240
mg,
because N = mg.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.549
So the force of friction seems
to depend on how heavy the

00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:44.200
object is that's sitting on the
table.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.940
But what does it not depend on
that it could depend on?

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:51.040
Can you think of something else
it could depend on but doesn't?

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.666
Yes?
Student: The amount of

00:28:53.666 --> 00:28:55.122
surface area.
Professor Ramamurti

00:28:55.122 --> 00:28:56.730
Shankar: It doesn't depend
on the area of contact.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:59.015
In other words,
if this was a rectangular

00:28:59.015 --> 00:29:02.329
block, it doesn't seem to matter
whether it's doing that or

00:29:02.329 --> 00:29:04.686
whether it's doing that.
You might think,

00:29:04.686 --> 00:29:07.429
hey, there's going to be more
friction because there's more

00:29:07.429 --> 00:29:09.269
contact.
But it doesn't.

00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:12.680
So, it's interesting not only
what it is but what it's not.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.539
Okay, this is called a
coefficient of static friction.

00:29:15.539 --> 00:29:19.917
So you guys should remember
that the force that friction

00:29:19.917 --> 00:29:23.261
applies is equal to the force
that I apply,

00:29:23.261 --> 00:29:27.331
up to a maximum of this.
And once I beat the maximum,

00:29:27.331 --> 00:29:29.829
it'll give up and it'll start
moving.

00:29:29.829 --> 00:29:32.583
Once it starts moving,
you're going to have a

00:29:32.583 --> 00:29:36.149
situation like this.
I apply F_me

00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:40.150
this way, and friction will
apply a force which now is

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:44.000
called new μ sub-kinetic
times N.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.461
So, the force of friction is
different when it's moving as

00:29:47.461 --> 00:29:50.618
compared to when it's not
moving, it's slightly less,

00:29:50.618 --> 00:29:54.634
once a body is in motion.
So, it's always true for all

00:29:54.634 --> 00:29:57.251
situations;
μ sub-kinetic is less

00:29:57.251 --> 00:29:58.790
than μ sub-static.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.600
Okay?
So, this is how you

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.145
characterize friction.
You study various objects and

00:30:11.145 --> 00:30:14.307
you find out friction certainly
depends on the nature of the two

00:30:14.307 --> 00:30:16.352
surfaces.
Given that constant,

00:30:16.352 --> 00:30:20.463
it seems to depend only on the
normal force and not on the

00:30:20.463 --> 00:30:22.910
area.
Yes?

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:25.131
Student: So is μ
sub-kinetic less than the

00:30:25.131 --> 00:30:26.758
maximum [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:30:26.758 --> 00:30:29.733
Shankar: Remember,
μ sub-kinetic is a

00:30:29.733 --> 00:30:31.730
fixed number.
Student: Right.

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:33.460
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Maybe .2.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.109
μ sub-static is a fixed
number, .25.

00:30:36.109 --> 00:30:40.728
If it's .25 for static,
it means if the normal force is

00:30:40.728 --> 00:30:44.491
some mg,
up to a quarter of the weight

00:30:44.491 --> 00:30:49.880
is the frictional force it can
apply to prevent its motion.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.932
Suppose I apply a force on a
body, which is originally

00:30:52.932 --> 00:30:55.390
1/10^(th) of its weight;
it won't move;

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:57.279
2/10^(th) of its weight it
won't move;

00:30:57.279 --> 00:30:59.420
a quarter of its weight it's a
tie;

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.000
.26 of its weight it'll start
moving.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.370
Once it starts moving,
frictional force will be .2

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:08.465
times its weight,
not .25, because the kinetic

00:31:08.465 --> 00:31:12.588
friction is less.
This is just the summary of

00:31:12.588 --> 00:31:16.132
friction.
Okay, so far even though I used

00:31:16.132 --> 00:31:20.579
vectors, most of the action is
just in one or the other

00:31:20.579 --> 00:31:22.480
direction.
Yes?

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.957
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:31:24.957 --> 00:31:27.030
Shankar: No,
it again seems to--It can

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:30.174
actually depend on many things.
Friction is something we don't

00:31:30.174 --> 00:31:32.507
understand fully.
But it depends only on the

00:31:32.507 --> 00:31:35.000
normal force,
just the way I described it.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.731
Okay.
Now, we are going to do the one

00:31:40.731 --> 00:31:45.099
problem that has sent more
people away from physics than

00:31:45.099 --> 00:31:48.019
anything else.
Do you know what it is?

00:31:48.019 --> 00:31:53.430
You haven't heard about the
problem that sends people away?

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:56.740
Okay, this is called the
inclined plane.

00:32:00.349 --> 00:32:03.209
A lot of people may not
remember where they were during

00:32:03.209 --> 00:32:05.275
the Kennedy assassination,
but they say,

00:32:05.275 --> 00:32:07.869
"I remember the day I saw the
inclined plane;

00:32:07.869 --> 00:32:10.140
that's the day I said I'm not
going into physics."

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:13.980
Because this is very bad
publicity for our field.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:17.495
You come into a subject hearing
about relativity and quantum

00:32:17.495 --> 00:32:20.892
mechanics and then--or maybe
gravitation and astrophysics,

00:32:20.892 --> 00:32:25.089
and we hit you with this.
So why am I doing this?

00:32:25.089 --> 00:32:28.112
Well, if you can do this and
you find it boring,

00:32:28.112 --> 00:32:30.692
you can move on.
But if you couldn't do this,

00:32:30.692 --> 00:32:33.792
you have no right to complain
because this is the entry ticket

00:32:33.792 --> 00:32:36.128
into the business.
You've got to be able to do

00:32:36.128 --> 00:32:37.886
this.
Only then I can tell you other

00:32:37.886 --> 00:32:40.480
things.
Okay, so we have to.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.680
We'll do this quickly.
I'm watching the clock.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.170
I won't linger over this,
but we have to do this problem.

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:50.307
Okay?
So let's quickly finish this

00:32:50.307 --> 00:32:52.259
problem.
So here is the problem.

00:32:52.259 --> 00:32:56.185
There is a mass,
m, sitting on its inclined

00:32:56.185 --> 00:32:59.549
plane, it'll make some angle
here.

00:32:59.549 --> 00:33:01.869
You want to know what it's
going to do.

00:33:01.869 --> 00:33:04.708
All right, we know it's going
to slide down the hill,

00:33:04.708 --> 00:33:07.683
but we want to be more precise,
and the whole purpose of

00:33:07.683 --> 00:33:10.422
Newton's Laws is to quantify
things for which you already

00:33:10.422 --> 00:33:13.500
have an intuition.
So the only novel thing about

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:17.741
the inclined plane is that for
the first time we are going to

00:33:17.741 --> 00:33:21.558
pick our x and y
axes not along the usual

00:33:21.558 --> 00:33:24.706
directions,
but along and perpendicular to

00:33:24.706 --> 00:33:27.684
the incline.
That's going to be my x

00:33:27.684 --> 00:33:30.210
and that's going to be my
y.

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:33.839
And I ask, what are the forces
on this mass?

00:33:33.839 --> 00:33:39.410
Well, I've told you,
first deal with contact forces.

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:41.990
But the only thing in contact
with the mass is the plane.

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:45.283
The inclined plane can exert a
force, in general,

00:33:45.283 --> 00:33:48.646
along its own surface and
perpendicular to its own

00:33:48.646 --> 00:33:51.119
surface.
But I'm going to take a case

00:33:51.119 --> 00:33:54.398
where there is no friction.
If there is no friction,

00:33:54.398 --> 00:33:58.470
by definition it cannot exert a
force along its own length.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.972
So it can only exert a force in
this direction and we're going

00:34:01.972 --> 00:34:07.046
to call that N.
Then, there's only one other

00:34:07.046 --> 00:34:09.130
force;
that's the force of gravity

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:10.719
which we agreed we have to
remember.

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:13.083
Even though the Earth is not
touching this block,

00:34:13.083 --> 00:34:15.988
the Earth is somewhere down
here, it's able to reach out and

00:34:15.988 --> 00:34:20.260
pull this block down.
So, let me show you the forces.

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:24.593
So here is N,
and here is mg,

00:34:24.593 --> 00:34:29.719
these are your forces.
And with no friction, that's it.

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:32.710
That's the key to doing any
problem I give you,

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:34.936
in any exam.
No matter how stressful,

00:34:34.936 --> 00:34:37.351
I guarantee you'll get it from
Newton's laws,

00:34:37.351 --> 00:34:40.589
provided you write every force
that is there and don't write

00:34:40.589 --> 00:34:43.570
any force that is not there.
So, this is it.

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:46.369
These are the two forces,
and the mass will do what these

00:34:46.369 --> 00:34:49.704
forces tell it to do.
So, what we want to do then,

00:34:49.704 --> 00:34:53.994
since my axes are in this
direction, I have to take this

00:34:53.994 --> 00:34:58.050
mg and write it as the
sum of two vectors,

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:01.140
one which is pointing in this
direction and one which is

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.282
pointing in that direction.
So, if I add these two arrows,

00:35:04.282 --> 00:35:06.958
I get mg.
That's called resolving the

00:35:06.958 --> 00:35:12.280
force into some other direction.
Now, the key to all of this is

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:17.963
to know that this angle,
here, is the same as this angle

00:35:17.963 --> 00:35:20.068
here.
In other words,

00:35:20.068 --> 00:35:24.756
if mg is acting down,
that angle θ is the

00:35:24.756 --> 00:35:27.909
same as this angle θ
here.

00:35:27.909 --> 00:35:31.598
This is going to be used all
the time, so I'll tell you a

00:35:31.598 --> 00:35:35.090
little trick that tells you how
I figured that out.

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:38.710
θ is the angle between
the horizontal and the incline.

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:42.476
Now, you've got to agree that
if I draw perpendicular to the

00:35:42.476 --> 00:35:45.860
horizontal and I draw
perpendicular to the incline,

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.507
the angle between those two
perpendiculars will be the same

00:35:48.507 --> 00:35:50.789
as the angle between the two
lines I began with,

00:35:50.789 --> 00:35:52.769
because perpendicular means
rotate by 90.

00:35:52.769 --> 00:35:55.994
If you rotate both lines by 90,
the angle between the rotated

00:35:55.994 --> 00:35:59.181
lines is the same.
The vertical is perpendicular

00:35:59.181 --> 00:36:02.675
to this horizontal,
and this is the perpendicular

00:36:02.675 --> 00:36:05.099
to the plane.
Once you got that,

00:36:05.099 --> 00:36:09.135
the rest is very easy.
So, in the x direction,

00:36:09.135 --> 00:36:12.451
I'm going to write the
following equation:

00:36:12.451 --> 00:36:16.981
mg times sin θ.
So, you've got to understand

00:36:16.981 --> 00:36:20.771
that this part here will be
mg times sin θ,

00:36:20.771 --> 00:36:24.760
and this part here will be
mg times cos θ.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.780
You've got--This is something
you better get really used to.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.580
If a vector is like this and
you want the force in that

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.589
direction, the angle between is
θ, then you put the

00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:36.027
cosine.
The component that's adjacent

00:36:36.027 --> 00:36:37.831
to the vector,
is the cosine,

00:36:37.831 --> 00:36:40.150
this one here is a sin
θ.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:43.513
So, I got the horizontal part
in the x direction,

00:36:43.513 --> 00:36:45.960
I got mg sin θ,
and that's it.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:49.778
There's nothing else.
That's got to be equal to

00:36:49.778 --> 00:36:52.994
m times ax.
Remember ax is not

00:36:52.994 --> 00:36:55.789
horizontal, ax is along
the incline, downhill.

00:36:55.789 --> 00:37:02.537
In the y direction I
write N - mg cos θ =

00:37:02.537 --> 00:37:07.972
m times ay.
That's simply writing down

00:37:07.972 --> 00:37:12.216
Newton's laws as two laws,
one along x and one

00:37:12.216 --> 00:37:15.563
along y,
and putting in whatever we

00:37:15.563 --> 00:37:18.612
know.
What happens next is up to what

00:37:18.612 --> 00:37:21.614
else we know.
Well, we know that this block

00:37:21.614 --> 00:37:25.395
is sliding down the hill,
it's not going into the block,

00:37:25.395 --> 00:37:27.940
nor is it flying out of the
block;

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:30.614
it's moving along the block.
That's the reason we chose a

00:37:30.614 --> 00:37:32.679
coordinate to be perpendicular
to the block,

00:37:32.679 --> 00:37:34.985
because that coordinate,
the y coordinate,

00:37:34.985 --> 00:37:37.557
it's not changing.
Even though the block is

00:37:37.557 --> 00:37:40.796
sliding down the hill,
when it's sliding down the hill

00:37:40.796 --> 00:37:43.670
the usual x and y
coordinates,

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:45.730
if you define them this way,
they're all changing.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:49.909
But by this clever choice,
it's always at y = 0.

00:37:49.909 --> 00:37:51.824
So, it has no y
coordinate, there's no y

00:37:51.824 --> 00:37:53.450
velocity, there's no y
acceleration.

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:58.755
So, we know this ay = 0.
So, this is an example where if

00:37:58.755 --> 00:38:01.957
we know the acceleration,
by this kind of argument,

00:38:01.957 --> 00:38:05.351
from that you deduce that
N has to be mg cos

00:38:05.351 --> 00:38:06.120
θ.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.511
Okay?
Then, you come to this fellow

00:38:13.511 --> 00:38:15.261
here.
There we find out that

00:38:15.261 --> 00:38:18.667
ax, you cancel the
m, and you find it's

00:38:18.667 --> 00:38:23.510
equal to g sin θ.
So, that's the big result.

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:27.050
It'll slide down the hill with
an acceleration g sin θ.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.487
This is a good way to measure
g, by the way,

00:38:29.487 --> 00:38:32.315
because if you drop something,
it falls too fast for you to

00:38:32.315 --> 00:38:34.348
time it.
But if you let it go down an

00:38:34.348 --> 00:38:37.347
incline, by making θ
very small so sin θ is

00:38:37.347 --> 00:38:39.519
very small and the grading is
very low,

00:38:39.519 --> 00:38:43.040
the body can accelerate with a
much slower acceleration

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.170
downhill, because it's reduced
by this factor,

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:49.683
sin θ.
Okay, here's another thing I

00:38:49.683 --> 00:38:54.295
should tell you right now.
Most of us, when we become

00:38:54.295 --> 00:38:58.520
professionals,
don't put in numbers till the

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.756
very end.
So, if you are told the incline

00:39:01.756 --> 00:39:04.541
is an angle of 37 degrees,
g is 9.8,

00:39:04.541 --> 00:39:08.190
don't start putting numbers
into the first equation.

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:11.125
We don't do that and I know for
some of you it's pretty

00:39:11.125 --> 00:39:14.487
traumatic to work with symbols,
and sometimes on exams they

00:39:14.487 --> 00:39:17.389
say, oh, you had all these
problems with symbols.

00:39:17.389 --> 00:39:20.019
But I want to sell you another
idea.

00:39:20.019 --> 00:39:22.773
It's much better to work with
symbols than with numbers till

00:39:22.773 --> 00:39:25.469
the end.
Why is that?

00:39:25.469 --> 00:39:27.486
First of all,
if you put numbers in,

00:39:27.486 --> 00:39:30.423
and I suddenly tell you,
"Hey, I was wrong about the

00:39:30.423 --> 00:39:32.424
slope,
it's really 39 degrees and not

00:39:32.424 --> 00:39:34.940
37," you're going to do the
whole calculation again.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.963
But this way,
you come to the formula and you

00:39:36.963 --> 00:39:39.602
say, "What's your θ?"
You change your mind,

00:39:39.602 --> 00:39:42.525
okay, that's the new θ.
You change the value of

00:39:42.525 --> 00:39:45.329
g, you made a better
measurement, that's the answer.

00:39:45.329 --> 00:39:49.269
Then, you can see if your
problem had some mistakes in it.

00:39:49.269 --> 00:39:52.519
Suppose you got g² of
sin θ.

00:39:52.519 --> 00:39:55.309
You will know it's wrong
because this is an acceleration

00:39:55.309 --> 00:39:58.117
and that's an acceleration.
The units have to match and

00:39:58.117 --> 00:40:00.099
sin θ,
of course, has no units.

00:40:00.099 --> 00:40:03.090
But maybe you got the
trigonometry wrong.

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:06.043
Maybe it's really g cos
θ that should be the right

00:40:06.043 --> 00:40:07.813
answer.
How do I know it's sin

00:40:07.813 --> 00:40:09.679
θ?
You can do a test.

00:40:09.679 --> 00:40:12.851
We know, for example,
as the incline becomes less and

00:40:12.851 --> 00:40:15.413
less inclined,
you got to get less and less

00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:17.978
acceleration,
because it's going downhill

00:40:17.978 --> 00:40:20.243
less and less,
and when θ goes to

00:40:20.243 --> 00:40:22.989
small values,
ax also diminishes.

00:40:22.989 --> 00:40:26.796
Or, if you take an incline and
you really make it almost

00:40:26.796 --> 00:40:30.880
vertical, and in the end you
make it completely vertical,

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.989
the block is just falling under
gravity.

00:40:32.989 --> 00:40:36.130
So, when θ is 90,
a becomes g.

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:40.661
So, you can test your results.
So, be prepared for that part,

00:40:40.661 --> 00:40:43.950
if you are in this course.
I will give you some homework

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:46.599
problems in which numbers are
not put in till the very end,

00:40:46.599 --> 00:40:48.698
or I may not even ask you to
put the numbers in,

00:40:48.698 --> 00:40:51.288
because the thing is to get
this formula because anyone can

00:40:51.288 --> 00:40:53.610
take the numbers and put them in
the calculator.

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:56.989
So, that's going to be part of
our agreement that we will work

00:40:56.989 --> 00:40:59.048
with symbols.
And if you look at any

00:40:59.048 --> 00:41:01.729
calculation we do,
if you caught me in my office,

00:41:01.729 --> 00:41:04.019
I'm not putting numbers in very
early.

00:41:04.019 --> 00:41:06.718
I mean, I cannot wait to find
out what the answer is but I

00:41:06.718 --> 00:41:09.369
keep the symbols till the end,
then I put the numbers.

00:41:09.369 --> 00:41:11.150
Then, you can vary different
numbers.

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:13.365
You can say,
"Well, what if gravity was

00:41:13.365 --> 00:41:15.240
weaker?
I go up to Denver and do the

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.160
experiment.
Will I get a different answer?"

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:19.485
You will.
So, how things depend on the

00:41:19.485 --> 00:41:22.477
input parameters is interesting.
Here's another interesting

00:41:22.477 --> 00:41:25.155
result.
What is missing in this formula

00:41:25.155 --> 00:41:30.309
that could have been there?
Student: Mass.

00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:31.010
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Pardon me?

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:32.896
The mass.
It doesn't seem to matter what

00:41:32.896 --> 00:41:34.963
the object is.
That's an interesting property

00:41:34.963 --> 00:41:37.019
of the result.
Right?

00:41:37.019 --> 00:41:39.412
And that's because m
cancelled out of the two sides

00:41:39.412 --> 00:41:41.999
of that equation.
So, these are all interesting

00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:45.762
features you would not know if
you kept numbers everywhere and

00:41:45.762 --> 00:41:48.969
you got a = .62 meters
per second squared.

00:41:48.969 --> 00:41:51.199
To me, that number doesn't tell
me as much.

00:41:51.199 --> 00:41:53.454
At the end, I want to know the
number but the formula is very

00:41:53.454 --> 00:41:55.849
interesting.
All right.

00:41:55.849 --> 00:41:59.510
So, now we are going to make it
a little more complicated.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:02.770
We are going to now add
friction to this.

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:11.080
So, here is the block but now
there's a coefficient,

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.424
the friction,
and let's say the block

00:42:13.424 --> 00:42:16.550
is--Let's ask the following
simple question.

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:18.710
I think it was related to what
one of you guys said.

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:22.746
Let the block be at rest and
θ is an angle I can

00:42:22.746 --> 00:42:24.689
vary.
Maybe there is a little thingy

00:42:24.689 --> 00:42:26.500
here, you can turn it back and
forth.

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.099
Let me crank up θ and
see where it'll start slipping.

00:42:29.099 --> 00:42:31.695
In other words,
there is a coefficient of

00:42:31.695 --> 00:42:34.940
static friction between the
block and the plane,

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:37.572
and I want to know,
like parking a car in San

00:42:37.572 --> 00:42:40.981
Francisco, what angle can it
take before it starts sliding

00:42:40.981 --> 00:42:43.719
down.
So, let's write the forces and

00:42:43.719 --> 00:42:49.699
let's write F = ma.
So, the forces are again here.

00:42:49.699 --> 00:42:54.281
Let me cut to the chase and
write mg cos θ here,

00:42:54.281 --> 00:42:57.530
N here,
mg sin θ here.

00:42:57.530 --> 00:43:02.010
What shall I write for friction?
Student: The first one.

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:03.277
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Do not write

00:43:03.277 --> 00:43:04.329
μ_s times
N,

00:43:04.329 --> 00:43:07.092
because the frictional force is
anything you need,

00:43:07.092 --> 00:43:09.630
up to μ_s
times N.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:12.170
In other words,
if θ was very small and

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:15.594
mg sin θ is very small,
the frictional force will be in

00:43:15.594 --> 00:43:18.480
fact mg sin θ.
So, it'll equal whatever it

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.751
takes to keep it from slipping.
But if I've cranked up the

00:43:21.751 --> 00:43:25.032
angle to that maximum angle,
beyond which it cannot stay

00:43:25.032 --> 00:43:28.909
there, let's give a name to that
angle that is sin θ*.

00:43:28.909 --> 00:43:32.360
Well, at the maximum angle
friction is doing the maximum

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.792
thing it can do;
then, we can certainly say

00:43:35.792 --> 00:43:40.927
mg sin θ is then equal
to the static friction times

00:43:40.927 --> 00:43:42.966
N,
which is now

00:43:42.966 --> 00:43:46.710
μ_s times
mg cos θ.

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:50.054
Again, the mass cancels.
So, it doesn't matter what kind

00:43:50.054 --> 00:43:52.781
of car you parked on the slope,
it only depends on the

00:43:52.781 --> 00:43:55.110
following.
But g cancels too.

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:57.879
So, whether you park your car
on the Earth or park it on

00:43:57.879 --> 00:44:00.044
another planet,
this is going to be the same

00:44:00.044 --> 00:44:03.046
restriction,
which is that tan θ has

00:44:03.046 --> 00:44:06.659
to be less than or equal to
μ_s;

00:44:06.659 --> 00:44:08.915
equal to μ_s
is the critical value,

00:44:08.915 --> 00:44:14.409
less than that is acceptable.
Okay, that's a simple problem.

00:44:14.409 --> 00:44:17.230
If you tilt it to more than
that it'll topple over.

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:21.242
So, now let's take another
problem where the block has

00:44:21.242 --> 00:44:25.580
started moving;
it's going down the hill.

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:29.346
Now, what formula do I write?
You notice that I'm not writing

00:44:29.346 --> 00:44:32.349
every step, every time.
Each time I deal with it I'm

00:44:32.349 --> 00:44:34.831
going to do some things faster.
For example,

00:44:34.831 --> 00:44:37.635
I already resolved gravity to
two parts, without going through

00:44:37.635 --> 00:44:39.980
the whole song and dance,
because you know how to do

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.239
that.
Now, I put in the friction.

00:44:42.239 --> 00:44:46.888
So now, I've got μ sub
kinetic not equal to 0,

00:44:46.888 --> 00:44:49.658
mass is moving.
You can ask,

00:44:49.658 --> 00:44:55.333
"What's the acceleration now?"
So, the horizontal equation

00:44:55.333 --> 00:45:00.696
along x is going to be
mg sin θ minus μ

00:45:00.696 --> 00:45:05.559
kinetic times a normal force,
but allow me to write for the

00:45:05.559 --> 00:45:09.730
normal force mg cos θ,
and that's got to be equal to

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:15.710
m times ax.
Now, can you do this?

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:18.460
That's the test.
It is not enough to watch me do

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:20.475
this and say,
okay, he seems to know what

00:45:20.475 --> 00:45:22.270
he's doing.
The question is,

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:24.681
can you do this?
Would you have thought about

00:45:24.681 --> 00:45:26.809
this?
Do you agree that I'm not doing

00:45:26.809 --> 00:45:29.570
anything beyond Newton's laws
when I do this?

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:34.125
Yes, each one of you should ask.
If you cannot do that,

00:45:34.125 --> 00:45:36.650
you have to deal with that now
because it's only going to get

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:37.974
compounded.
On the other hand,

00:45:37.974 --> 00:45:39.811
if you can do this,
you know everything I know

00:45:39.811 --> 00:45:42.026
about Newton's laws.
This is all there is to

00:45:42.026 --> 00:45:44.080
Newton's laws and how to apply
them.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.972
So, you cancel the m.
So, notice here,

00:45:46.972 --> 00:45:50.198
this is the normal force,
but I've taken the y

00:45:50.198 --> 00:45:53.610
equation that says normal force
is mg cos θ.

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:57.318
Put that here.
Then, I find acceleration is

00:45:57.318 --> 00:46:02.394
g times sin θ –
μ sub-kinetic cos

00:46:02.394 --> 00:46:03.240
θ.

00:46:09.559 --> 00:46:13.692
Okay, here is the result:
ax is what I'm calling

00:46:13.692 --> 00:46:16.858
a now.
I want to study this in various

00:46:16.858 --> 00:46:18.960
limits.
The first limit I take is no

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.630
coefficient of kinetic friction,
I get back to my sin θ.

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:26.489
Well, let me try the following
interesting limits.

00:46:26.489 --> 00:46:29.243
I crank up the coefficient of
kinetic friction,

00:46:29.243 --> 00:46:32.390
more and more and more.
Look what happens here:

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:36.050
sin θ and cos θ
are fixed numbers.

00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:39.023
If this becomes larger than
some amount, than say 10,

00:46:39.023 --> 00:46:40.910
what happens to the expression?

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:46.630
a is negative.
And what does that mean?

00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:47.050
Student: It's going
uphill.

00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:49.424
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: The block is moving

00:46:49.424 --> 00:46:51.070
uphill.
And do you buy that?

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:54.141
So, what's wrong?
I mean, I took the equation,

00:46:54.141 --> 00:46:55.988
right?
I told you all the time how you

00:46:55.988 --> 00:46:59.039
can study various limits.
Something is wrong.

00:46:59.039 --> 00:47:02.410
It says, if kinetic friction is
very large, the block will move

00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:03.876
uphill.
Student: [inaudible]

00:47:03.876 --> 00:47:05.648
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: That's not the

00:47:05.648 --> 00:47:06.880
reason.
Yes?

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:14.349
Student: It can't be
greater than the static one.

00:47:14.349 --> 00:47:15.128
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No,

00:47:15.128 --> 00:47:17.516
that's not the reason.
I mean, you can also vary the

00:47:17.516 --> 00:47:20.394
angles, maybe keeping k
at some value,

00:47:20.394 --> 00:47:24.580
vary the angles so that this
number times that can beat this.

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:26.210
Then what happens?
Yes?

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:30.432
Student: Where do you
find the direction of sin

00:47:30.432 --> 00:47:32.185
θ downhill?
Professor Ramamurti

00:47:32.185 --> 00:47:33.290
Shankar: That is the point.
Okay?

00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:36.239
Let me repeat his answer;
that's the correct answer.

00:47:36.239 --> 00:47:39.375
You're right about kinetic
being less than static and so

00:47:39.375 --> 00:47:40.921
on.
But you can always imagine

00:47:40.921 --> 00:47:44.025
keeping that number constant but
changing the angle to the cosine

00:47:44.025 --> 00:47:45.820
gets bigger and sine gets
smaller.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.188
At some point,
you agree, cosine will beat the

00:47:48.188 --> 00:47:51.083
sine, because sine is going
towards 0 and cosine's going

00:47:51.083 --> 00:47:53.757
towards 1.
But the correct answer is,

00:47:53.757 --> 00:47:57.633
in writing this forced law,
I'm assuming the force of

00:47:57.633 --> 00:48:00.539
friction points to the left,
uphill.

00:48:00.539 --> 00:48:04.730
That is correct only if the
body is moving downhill.

00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:08.379
But if you got an answer where
a was negative,

00:48:08.379 --> 00:48:12.659
therefore it's going uphill,
the starting premise is wrong.

00:48:12.659 --> 00:48:15.769
So, one very useful lesson to
learn here is when you apply

00:48:15.769 --> 00:48:18.551
formula, don't forget the
conditions under which you

00:48:18.551 --> 00:48:21.683
derived it,
and don't apply the result to a

00:48:21.683 --> 00:48:26.087
case where the answer does not
belong to the domain that you

00:48:26.087 --> 00:48:30.765
assumed you're applying it to.
So, the trouble with friction

00:48:30.765 --> 00:48:34.472
is the following.
Friction is not a definite

00:48:34.472 --> 00:48:38.599
force with a definite magnitude
or direction.

00:48:38.599 --> 00:48:42.159
The magnitude is definite,
but direction is not definite.

00:48:42.159 --> 00:48:44.590
It is uphill if you're going
downhill;

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:46.210
it's downhill if you're going
uphill.

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:50.079
It's like the constant
opposition to motion.

00:48:50.079 --> 00:48:52.345
There is force of gravity,
the normal force,

00:48:52.345 --> 00:48:54.400
everything else is a fixed
direction;

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.869
you can draw it once and for
all.

00:48:55.869 --> 00:48:58.062
So in a formula,
where the forces are what they

00:48:58.062 --> 00:49:00.302
are in any context,
you can apply the formula in

00:49:00.302 --> 00:49:02.528
any limit.
But if the frictional force

00:49:02.528 --> 00:49:05.704
assumed a downward motion,
don't apply it when the block

00:49:05.704 --> 00:49:08.684
is going up.
Okay, so I'm going to do one

00:49:08.684 --> 00:49:13.138
more of these inclined planes
and then pretty much done with

00:49:13.138 --> 00:49:14.800
the inclined plane.

00:49:22.489 --> 00:49:26.659
Okay, this is a problem of two
masses.

00:49:26.659 --> 00:49:31.041
There's a rope that goes over
the pulley, let's call this

00:49:31.041 --> 00:49:35.423
m, let's call that
M, and this angle again,

00:49:35.423 --> 00:49:38.239
it's θ,
and no friction.

00:49:38.239 --> 00:49:41.179
You can mix and match various
things but let's keep friction

00:49:41.179 --> 00:49:43.969
out because I'm trying to do
something different here.

00:49:43.969 --> 00:49:50.239
So, you want to know what these
guys will do now.

00:49:50.239 --> 00:49:53.298
So first guess is,
well, M looks so

00:49:53.298 --> 00:49:57.400
impressive compared to small
m, so maybe it'll go

00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.993
downhill.
But I realize that's of course

00:49:59.993 --> 00:50:02.050
fallacy because M is a
symbol;

00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:04.797
the value associated with it
maybe 1/10^(th) that of

00:50:04.797 --> 00:50:06.672
m.
But if M really is

00:50:06.672 --> 00:50:09.084
bigger than m,
then am I assured it'll go

00:50:09.084 --> 00:50:16.000
downhill?
Student: The mass has to

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.721
be greater.
[inaudible]

00:50:18.721 --> 00:50:19.694
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No,

00:50:19.694 --> 00:50:20.770
no, I'm saying,
if the big mass M is

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:21.820
bigger than the small mass
m,

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:23.170
is that enough to say it'll go
downhill?

00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:24.719
Yes?
Student: No,

00:50:24.719 --> 00:50:26.517
it depends on the angle.
Professor Ramamurti

00:50:26.517 --> 00:50:28.337
Shankar: It depends on the
angle because part of the mass

00:50:28.337 --> 00:50:29.429
is not helpful in going
downhill.

00:50:29.429 --> 00:50:33.762
See, if I had a pulley like
this, then you're absolutely

00:50:33.762 --> 00:50:37.602
right, the big guy wins.
Now, it's not clear because

00:50:37.602 --> 00:50:40.590
this has got all of gravity
pulling it down;

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:43.460
this has got only part of
gravity pulling it down.

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:46.329
So, let's skip this direction,
it's not very interesting.

00:50:46.329 --> 00:50:48.903
But let's look at this
direction, for which the

00:50:48.903 --> 00:50:52.573
equation is the following.
If I just took that block,

00:50:52.573 --> 00:50:57.104
it's got mg sin θ
acting down, and this rope will

00:50:57.104 --> 00:51:00.178
exert a certain tension
T, here,

00:51:00.178 --> 00:51:05.691
which I don't know.
Under the combined effect of

00:51:05.691 --> 00:51:13.470
these two, I can say mg sin -
T = ma, where a is

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:18.700
assumed to be positive going
downhill.

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:23.097
That's one equation.
Then, I come to this fellow

00:51:23.097 --> 00:51:27.446
here, this block;
well, it's got mg acting

00:51:27.446 --> 00:51:30.981
down and tension acting up.
I'm sorry guys,

00:51:30.981 --> 00:51:33.710
I made one mistake here.
I think you know what it is.

00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:39.823
These should be M,
that should be M,

00:51:39.823 --> 00:51:45.062
sorry for that,
and M (Mg sin θ – T =

00:51:45.062 --> 00:51:47.989
Ma).
For m,

00:51:47.989 --> 00:51:51.619
the equation is T –
mg.

00:51:51.619 --> 00:51:53.949
Now, let's be careful with what
I do next.

00:51:53.949 --> 00:51:56.992
I'm going to say m times
a, which is the same

00:51:56.992 --> 00:52:00.357
a.
You should all understand why

00:52:00.357 --> 00:52:04.489
the acceleration in magnitude is
the same.

00:52:04.489 --> 00:52:06.480
We're not saying the direction
is the same.

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.800
This is accelerating downhill,
at some angle;

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.542
that's accelerating uphill.
These are not equations which

00:52:11.542 --> 00:52:13.548
are vectors;
these stand for equations along

00:52:13.548 --> 00:52:16.118
certain directions.
This is the up/down direction

00:52:16.118 --> 00:52:19.261
here, and that is up the slope,
down the slope direction,

00:52:19.261 --> 00:52:22.326
for that one.
But I think you realize if the

00:52:22.326 --> 00:52:25.575
rope is inelastic,
if this mass moves down one

00:52:25.575 --> 00:52:28.320
inch, that's got to go up one
inch.

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:30.501
Therefore, if it goes one inch
in one second,

00:52:30.501 --> 00:52:33.078
so will the other guy,
they'll have the same velocity

00:52:33.078 --> 00:52:35.210
and they'll have the same
acceleration.

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:38.239
So, that's why there's only one
unknown acceleration,

00:52:38.239 --> 00:52:40.435
a.
Once you realize that you're

00:52:40.435 --> 00:52:42.489
done because now we know what to
do.

00:52:42.489 --> 00:52:46.357
Whenever you see a –T
and a + T,

00:52:46.357 --> 00:52:50.637
you add them and you get
g times M sin θ -

00:52:50.637 --> 00:52:52.398
m.
On this side,

00:52:52.398 --> 00:52:55.720
it's going to be M + m
times a.

00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:59.075
Can you see that?
So, let me short circuit one

00:52:59.075 --> 00:53:02.260
step, and divide by M +
m.

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:08.331
So, that's the formula here.
And again, you got to ask,

00:53:08.331 --> 00:53:11.852
does it make sense?
Now you notice that for it to

00:53:11.852 --> 00:53:16.219
be positive, and to go downhill,
it's not enough if M is

00:53:16.219 --> 00:53:19.064
bigger than m.
M sin θ should be

00:53:19.064 --> 00:53:21.486
bigger than m;
that's because M sin θ

00:53:21.486 --> 00:53:23.550
is the part that's really
pulling downhill.

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:26.762
M cos θ is trying to
ram it into the inclined plane,

00:53:26.762 --> 00:53:29.429
and that's being countered by
the normal force.

00:53:29.429 --> 00:53:35.389
The second thing to notice is:
can I use this formula when

00:53:35.389 --> 00:53:39.780
m is bigger than M sin
θ?

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:42.492
In other words,
can I use this formula when

00:53:42.492 --> 00:53:45.735
a becomes a negative?
After all, I did all my

00:53:45.735 --> 00:53:49.028
thinking saying it's going down,
but can I use it when it's

00:53:49.028 --> 00:53:51.269
going up?
Students: Yes.

00:53:51.269 --> 00:53:52.272
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes,

00:53:52.272 --> 00:53:54.436
and the reason?
Anybody want to say why that's

00:53:54.436 --> 00:53:58.000
okay here?
Yes?

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.376
Student: No friction.
Professor Ramamurti

00:54:01.376 --> 00:54:03.611
Shankar: Right.
Student: And friction is

00:54:03.611 --> 00:54:04.530
a force, depending upon which
[inaudible]

00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:05.769
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: That's correct.

00:54:05.769 --> 00:54:08.715
All the forces I drew here,
they're not going to change

00:54:08.715 --> 00:54:11.280
their mind when you change the
body's motion.

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:13.500
Gravity is always going to pull
down.

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:16.886
So, all these forces are fixed
in magnitude and direction,

00:54:16.886 --> 00:54:20.510
and therefore once you got a
formula for positive a,

00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:22.970
you can apply it to negative
a, but you cannot do it

00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:24.880
when you have friction because
in friction,

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:27.090
you assume the direction of
motion.

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:32.460
All right, so now I'm going to
leave the plane.

00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:35.159
This is it.
We are finished with the plane.

00:54:35.159 --> 00:54:38.514
You are not finished because,
oh don't clap here,

00:54:38.514 --> 00:54:41.730
I got a homework problem,
by popular demand.

00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:44.780
Two masses, one pulley and
friction.

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:48.590
That's to really say we're
finished with the plane.

00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:51.586
Once you can do that,
you've graduated from this boot

00:54:51.586 --> 00:54:53.400
camp;
you can handle anything else.

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:55.460
But that's not something I want
to do in class.

00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:57.933
That's something you do in the
privacy of your room,

00:54:57.933 --> 00:54:59.970
put all these things in and
crank it up.

00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:03.551
And you also have enough time.
But that's a very--that's got

00:55:03.551 --> 00:55:06.500
some interesting angles you
should think about.

00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:12.392
Okay, so now I'm going to do
physics that basically involves

00:55:12.392 --> 00:55:15.704
rotational motion.
But let me do one Mickey-Mouse

00:55:15.704 --> 00:55:18.070
problem, and let it go,
because I assigned it to you.

00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:20.848
The typical problem is:
there's a tree here,

00:55:20.848 --> 00:55:23.819
there's a tree here,
and that is--there are two

00:55:23.819 --> 00:55:27.890
ropes and there's a backpack
hanging here with some weight.

00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:33.639
You are told what that angle is;
you're told what that angle is.

00:55:33.639 --> 00:55:37.000
You are supposed to find the
tension on these two ropes.

00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:44.610
I think it's fairly simple so I
won't do the details but you

00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:48.076
know what you're supposed to do.
You take these two tensions,

00:55:48.076 --> 00:55:51.947
break them into the horizontal
parts, with sines and cosines,

00:55:51.947 --> 00:55:55.806
and into vertical parts;
horizontal parts that cancel

00:55:55.806 --> 00:55:58.350
because of this mass.
This backpack is not going

00:55:58.350 --> 00:56:00.529
anywhere horizontally;
the vertical parts of these

00:56:00.529 --> 00:56:03.276
two, which will be in fact
additive, should cancel the

00:56:03.276 --> 00:56:06.315
weight of the object.
That gives you two simultaneous

00:56:06.315 --> 00:56:08.920
equations for T_1 and
T_2,

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.699
and you can fiddle with them,
and solve them.

00:56:11.699 --> 00:56:15.187
Well, by the way I should tell
you, if you got some equation

00:56:15.187 --> 00:56:17.669
like T_1 sin θ
_1 =

00:56:17.669 --> 00:56:20.112
T_2,
sin θ _2,

00:56:20.112 --> 00:56:21.973
or that – T_2
sin θ is 0,

00:56:21.973 --> 00:56:24.512
and another equation involving
T_1 with some

00:56:24.512 --> 00:56:26.119
numbers and
T_2.

00:56:26.119 --> 00:56:29.859
Some of you seemed to have
trouble the other day when there

00:56:29.859 --> 00:56:32.923
were sin θs here;
whereas, if these had been

00:56:32.923 --> 00:56:35.366
numbers like 3 and 4,
you knew how to solve these

00:56:35.366 --> 00:56:38.016
simultaneous equations.
But I want you to realize that

00:56:38.016 --> 00:56:39.962
the solving of the simultaneous
equations for

00:56:39.962 --> 00:56:42.262
T_1 and
T_2 involve

00:56:42.262 --> 00:56:44.960
forming combinations of these
coefficients to eliminate either

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:47.260
T_1 or
T_2.

00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:49.360
So, when you add them,
one of them drops out.

00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:52.757
And that doesn't depend on
whether these are trigonometric

00:56:52.757 --> 00:56:56.393
functions or any other numbers,
they're eliminated in the same

00:56:56.393 --> 00:56:58.267
way.
Likewise on the right hand

00:56:58.267 --> 00:57:00.524
side, instead of some numbers
like 3 and 4,

00:57:00.524 --> 00:57:03.050
you have the weight,
W, of this mass;

00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:05.531
well, if you multiply this
equation by 3,

00:57:05.531 --> 00:57:08.199
multiply everything by 3 and
juggle them.

00:57:08.199 --> 00:57:12.175
So, you should get used to
eliminating coefficients which

00:57:12.175 --> 00:57:15.048
are not simply numbers,
which are symbols,

00:57:15.048 --> 00:57:17.855
sines, cosines,
but you know how to--If you had

00:57:17.855 --> 00:57:20.671
a sine here and a cosine there,
for example,

00:57:20.671 --> 00:57:23.566
how will you combine them?
Maybe you'll multiply this by a

00:57:23.566 --> 00:57:25.782
cosine and that by a sine,
and if you subtract it'll drop

00:57:25.782 --> 00:57:27.295
out.
You've got to do stuff like

00:57:27.295 --> 00:57:30.010
that.
Okay?

00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:32.524
But it's important that in a
Physics 200 Level course you are

00:57:32.524 --> 00:57:36.205
able to solve those things.
Okay, now I'm coming to the

00:57:36.205 --> 00:57:41.226
interesting problems in which
motion involves going in a

00:57:41.226 --> 00:57:43.800
circle.
So here's one problem.

00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:49.051
This is a string on which there
is a mass and the mass is going

00:57:49.051 --> 00:57:53.417
around in a circle.
This is like an amusement park,

00:57:53.417 --> 00:57:56.672
so that they have these
dangling little,

00:57:56.672 --> 00:57:58.754
tiny,
baby rockets and you sit there

00:57:58.754 --> 00:58:01.159
and start spinning,
and instead of being vertical,

00:58:01.159 --> 00:58:03.564
it starts lifting up,
and you want to know why it's

00:58:03.564 --> 00:58:06.041
lifting up.
So, if this angle here is

00:58:06.041 --> 00:58:10.706
θ, and this is some mass
m, and it's going around

00:58:10.706 --> 00:58:13.519
in a circle with velocity
v,

00:58:13.519 --> 00:58:15.719
and the radius of the circle is
say r;

00:58:15.719 --> 00:58:19.150
we want to find some relation
between this angle θ and

00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:21.400
these other parameters in the
problem.

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:26.170
So what do I do?
I apply F = ma,

00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:28.638
that's it;
and I'm going to get everything

00:58:28.638 --> 00:58:30.700
by applying F = ma,
to this guy.

00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:35.886
So, here is that mass.
The tension on the rope can

00:58:35.886 --> 00:58:39.800
only be along the rope.
The rope is not a rigid object.

00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:42.139
It cannot exert a force
perpendicular to itself.

00:58:42.139 --> 00:58:44.610
It can only pull it along each
direction.

00:58:44.610 --> 00:58:49.592
That's the tension on the rope.
There is mg,

00:58:49.592 --> 00:58:54.758
and that's it.
Under these things it's going

00:58:54.758 --> 00:58:58.618
to obey F = ma.
So, what I do with this tension

00:58:58.618 --> 00:59:01.020
is I trade this guy for two
forces.

00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:04.659
This is T.
If that angle is θ;

00:59:04.659 --> 00:59:07.429
let me see, that angle is
θ;

00:59:07.429 --> 00:59:12.500
so this is T sin θ,
and this is T cos θ.

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:15.878
So, you trade that oblique
T for two Ts that

00:59:15.878 --> 00:59:18.130
are in the actual simple
directions.

00:59:18.130 --> 00:59:22.947
The fact that it's not going up
or down vertically tells me

00:59:22.947 --> 00:59:27.063
mg = T sin θ.
Students: [inaudible]

00:59:27.063 --> 00:59:29.266
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Oh,

00:59:29.266 --> 00:59:30.310
I'm sorry, yes.

00:59:35.110 --> 00:59:39.320
Okay, then in the other
direction T sin θ is the

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.688
horizontal force,
that's got to be mass times

00:59:42.688 --> 00:59:46.024
acceleration.
At the instant--but I've shown

00:59:46.024 --> 00:59:49.549
the object, because it's going
in a circle, it has an

00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:51.651
acceleration,
in this direction,

00:59:51.651 --> 00:59:56.380
with size v²/R.
Therefore, if you divide this

00:59:56.380 --> 01:00:02.334
equation by that equation you
will get v²/Rg = tan θ,

01:00:02.334 --> 01:00:07.410
and that's the angle that the
string will assume.

01:00:11.539 --> 01:00:14.020
So, if you know the velocity
you can do this problem.

01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:22.739
Okay, then here's another
interesting problem.

01:00:22.739 --> 01:00:26.331
When you go on these roads,
if you're going in a circle--so

01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:29.304
for this is your car,
I'm looking at you from the

01:00:29.304 --> 01:00:34.039
top, you're going in a circle.
Anything wrong?

01:00:34.039 --> 01:00:36.971
Going in a circle,
you're accelerating towards the

01:00:36.971 --> 01:00:39.106
center;
someone's got to provide the

01:00:39.106 --> 01:00:42.830
force, that's what Newton says.
That force is the friction

01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:47.030
between your tire and the road.
In fact, it's a case of static

01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:49.014
friction.
You might think it's kinetic

01:00:49.014 --> 01:00:51.596
because the car is moving,
but it's not moving in this

01:00:51.596 --> 01:00:53.680
direction.
So, it's a static friction that

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.604
keeps you from slipping.
So, you need a certain static

01:00:56.604 --> 01:00:58.761
friction;
so that N times

01:00:58.761 --> 01:01:02.570
μ static -- that
N is equal to mg

01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:05.179
-- must be equal to
mv²/R.

01:01:05.179 --> 01:01:08.381
If you don't have the static
friction, your car will not be

01:01:08.381 --> 01:01:10.590
able to make the curve,
it'll fly off.

01:01:10.590 --> 01:01:14.091
So, what people have done is to
find a clever way in which you

01:01:14.091 --> 01:01:17.880
don't have to have any friction
and you can still make the turn;

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:21.690
that is, to bank your road.
So imagine, now you're going

01:01:21.690 --> 01:01:23.993
into the blackboard and you're
turning left,

01:01:23.993 --> 01:01:26.780
and the road looks like this,
going away from me.

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:29.630
Now, I don't have to draw this
thing.

01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:33.118
This road is a track,
a racetrack going around and

01:01:33.118 --> 01:01:35.990
round like this.
And I gave it some angle

01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:39.248
θ.
This road has no friction so it

01:01:39.248 --> 01:01:45.282
can only exert a force that way.
But let me resolve that force

01:01:45.282 --> 01:01:50.007
into two parts,
one like this and one like

01:01:50.007 --> 01:01:52.766
this.
Again, if these two have an

01:01:52.766 --> 01:01:55.352
angle θ,
that is the same angle

01:01:55.352 --> 01:01:58.345
θ there,
and there is the mass of the

01:01:58.345 --> 01:02:03.239
car this way.
So, what do I find?

01:02:03.239 --> 01:02:16.570
I find N cos θ = mg and
N sin θ = mv²/R.

01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:24.469
Therefore, if you again take
the ratios you will find tan

01:02:24.469 --> 01:02:28.536
θ = v²/Rg.
I think this may be a little

01:02:28.536 --> 01:02:31.019
fast now but you guys can do the
algebra.

01:02:31.019 --> 01:02:32.780
What that means is the
following.

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:35.576
If you want the car to go
around the bend,

01:02:35.576 --> 01:02:38.782
at a certain speed,
40 miles per hour or so many

01:02:38.782 --> 01:02:42.555
kilometers per hour,
and the road itself is part of

01:02:42.555 --> 01:02:45.670
a circle of radius r;
it doesn't have to be a full

01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:47.326
circle.
At that instant it has to be a

01:02:47.326 --> 01:02:50.304
part of a circle.
Then, if you bank your road at

01:02:50.304 --> 01:02:54.489
that angle, you don't need any
friction to make the turn.

01:02:54.489 --> 01:02:57.119
You got to understand how we
beat the system.

01:02:57.119 --> 01:03:00.234
If your road instead of being
flat is tilted,

01:03:00.234 --> 01:03:04.552
then even though the road can
only exert a frictionless normal

01:03:04.552 --> 01:03:06.962
force,
now part of the normal force is

01:03:06.962 --> 01:03:09.711
pointing to the center.
In fact, this picture is not

01:03:09.711 --> 01:03:11.572
drawn to scale.
If I drew it that way,

01:03:11.572 --> 01:03:14.274
this part of the vector is
horizontal and directed towards

01:03:14.274 --> 01:03:16.550
the center of the circle,
on which you orbit.

01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:18.820
So, that's how you do the
banking.

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:21.760
In any good system of roads you
will find there is banking.

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:26.160
Okay, I'm going to do the last
problem because it's in the

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:30.715
homework, and maybe I'm a little
late today, I apologize for

01:03:30.715 --> 01:03:32.748
that.
The last problem is a very

01:03:32.748 --> 01:03:35.373
famous, very important,
and that's the loop-the-loop

01:03:35.373 --> 01:03:36.798
problem.
As you know,

01:03:36.798 --> 01:03:40.373
the loop-the-loop is when you
come down on a track,

01:03:40.373 --> 01:03:43.734
you go on a circle,
and for awhile you're upside

01:03:43.734 --> 01:03:46.855
down.
And the famous question is,

01:03:46.855 --> 01:03:50.420
"Why don't you fall down?"
What's the trick?

01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:52.340
Does it violate Newton's laws,
and so on?

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:55.230
We'll find we can understand it
fully with Newton's laws.

01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:58.263
But we'll find out that in
order for this thing to pull it

01:03:58.263 --> 01:04:01.510
off, its speed at that instant
has to have a minimum value.

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:07.538
And the application of Newton's
law to this object is very

01:04:07.538 --> 01:04:09.929
simple.
Here is gravity.

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:14.280
What about the track on which
it's going?

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.590
What's the direction of the
force the track exerts?

01:04:16.590 --> 01:04:19.292
Student: Down.
Professor Ramamurti

01:04:19.292 --> 01:04:20.200
Shankar: Pardon me?
Down.

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:23.171
Anybody said up?
A track cannot exert a force

01:04:23.171 --> 01:04:25.239
upwards, down.
So everybody,

01:04:25.239 --> 01:04:29.519
track, mg and they're
all acting down.

01:04:29.519 --> 01:04:31.469
So you see, that's when you get
a little worried.

01:04:31.469 --> 01:04:33.969
Okay, this guy's up there,
all the forces are down.

01:04:33.969 --> 01:04:37.590
So, we got to ask,
so what does that mean?

01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:39.449
Well, I have to agree they're
all down.

01:04:39.449 --> 01:04:42.198
I say T + mg is the
downward force,

01:04:42.198 --> 01:04:44.410
that's got to be mv²/r.

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:56.820
Therefore, T = m times
(v²/R – g).

01:05:05.170 --> 01:05:08.302
So, what does that mean?
If this T comes out

01:05:08.302 --> 01:05:11.452
negative, you're dead,
because if it's negative,

01:05:11.452 --> 01:05:15.539
you want the track to exert an
upward force and it cannot.

01:05:15.539 --> 01:05:18.880
In a real amusement park they
have other T-brackets and

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.406
so on to support you.
But if you really believe in

01:05:21.406 --> 01:05:23.532
the laws of physics,
you don't need any of that,

01:05:23.532 --> 01:05:25.929
you just got to make sure this
number is positive.

01:05:25.929 --> 01:05:30.624
For it to be positive,
you need v² bigger than

01:05:30.624 --> 01:05:34.330
or equal to Rg.
So, you got to make sure when

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:37.110
you're on the top,
you have this minimum velocity.

01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:41.869
If you go faster than that,
that is just fine;

01:05:41.869 --> 01:05:44.616
if you go faster than that,
T will be some positive

01:05:44.616 --> 01:05:47.035
number.
So, here's the interesting

01:05:47.035 --> 01:05:48.949
thing.
Have we escaped the pull of

01:05:48.949 --> 01:05:51.520
gravity?
How come we are not falling

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.413
down?
And the track is not helping

01:05:53.413 --> 01:05:55.619
us, it's also pushing us down.
Yes?

01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:59.394
Student: The velocity
vector is moving towards the

01:05:59.394 --> 01:06:02.225
left and the force;
well, the full force is

01:06:02.225 --> 01:06:06.067
changing the direction of the
velocity towards the center,

01:06:06.067 --> 01:06:09.369
but it's still going along a
circular path.

01:06:09.369 --> 01:06:10.349
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Okay.

01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:11.909
Student: You can make
that for forced radials today.

01:06:11.909 --> 01:06:12.550
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes.

01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:14.798
So, the point is,
if you have an apple,

01:06:14.798 --> 01:06:16.809
with two forces,
both pushing down,

01:06:16.809 --> 01:06:18.940
that apple is accelerating
down,

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:22.067
and accelerating down means
really falling towards the

01:06:22.067 --> 01:06:24.900
ground, towards the center of
the circle here.

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:27.259
In this example,
it is definitely accelerating,

01:06:27.259 --> 01:06:29.823
but the acceleration is not
added to zero velocity,

01:06:29.823 --> 01:06:32.489
in which case it'll pick up
more and more speed;

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:34.960
it's added to a huge horizontal
velocity.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:38.034
So, in a tiny time,
you give it a little velocity

01:06:38.034 --> 01:06:41.429
like this, your new velocity
points at a new angle.

01:06:41.429 --> 01:06:45.168
That just means your body has
come here and has stopped going

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:47.659
like that and started going like
this.

01:06:47.659 --> 01:06:51.076
Therefore, downward
acceleration does not mean

01:06:51.076 --> 01:06:55.251
coming closer to the ground,
it only means your velocity

01:06:55.251 --> 01:06:58.059
vector is changing its
direction.

01:06:58.059 --> 01:07:00.605
On the other hand,
if you had no velocity vector,

01:07:00.605 --> 01:07:03.309
downward acceleration means
what you think it is.

01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:05.783
That is why,
if you drop an apple from here,

01:07:05.783 --> 01:07:08.199
it has an acceleration due to
mg;

01:07:08.199 --> 01:07:10.300
if the track was pushing it
down even more,

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:12.849
it'll fall towards the ground
and hit the ground.

01:07:12.849 --> 01:07:16.618
Here it actually has an
acceleration but it doesn't mean

01:07:16.618 --> 01:07:19.360
that you are any closer to the
center.

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.928
Going around in a circle is an
example of constantly

01:07:21.928 --> 01:07:25.000
accelerating towards the center
but not getting any closer.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
That's the way vectors work and
you should think about that.

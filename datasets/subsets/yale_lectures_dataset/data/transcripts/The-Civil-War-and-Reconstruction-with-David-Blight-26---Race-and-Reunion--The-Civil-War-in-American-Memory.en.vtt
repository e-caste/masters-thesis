00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.030
Professor David Blight:
In his little novel The

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.349
Hamlet, William Faulkner has
a line he puts in the mouth of

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.490
one of his characters.
It's one of the Snopes'.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.488
There's lots of Snopes' in
Faulkner's novels,

00:00:28.488 --> 00:00:33.202
especially that novel.
It comes from the deep,

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:38.046
dark heart, as only Faulkner
really wrote it,

00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:43.234
of the burden of the past,
of memory of slavery,

00:00:43.234 --> 00:00:46.937
the Civil War,
and Reconstruction on the

00:00:46.937 --> 00:00:51.590
South, but he's really referring
to all of us,

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.010
he's referring to humanity.
It's one of the best single

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.035
sentence descriptive
explanations of what happened to

00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:04.680
the legacy and memory of all
these events I've ever read.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.607
He has his character say,
"Only thank God men have done

00:01:10.607 --> 00:01:17.413
learned how to forget quick what
they ain't brave enough to try

00:01:17.413 --> 00:01:22.269
to cure."
I'll do it once more.

00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:28.350
"Only thank God men have done
learned how to forget quick what

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.840
they ain't brave enough to
cure."

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.357
Can't solve that problem,
weighed down too heavily by

00:01:37.357 --> 00:01:41.707
that problem,
don't have the solutions for

00:01:41.707 --> 00:01:47.579
all the world's ills,
it's an ancient problem,

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:54.690
it's a natural problem,
forget it, try to forget it.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:03.509
Structure ways to forget it.
Americans weren't forgetting by

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.250
1876, at least in a host of
ways.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.913
They were about to have the
magnificent centennial of their

00:02:10.913 --> 00:02:14.277
independence.
Now that year will bring,

00:02:14.277 --> 00:02:18.074
as we'll see in a moment,
a pivotal election,

00:02:18.074 --> 00:02:21.885
to say the least.
It'll end in a disputed--the

00:02:21.885 --> 00:02:25.236
first--not the first,
really the second--great

00:02:25.236 --> 00:02:28.289
disputed election in American
history,

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:32.097
and a sordid political
compromise that most of us in

00:02:32.097 --> 00:02:36.949
textbooks and in teaching still
call the end of Reconstruction.

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.922
But I'm going to leave that
question of when Reconstruction

00:02:39.922 --> 00:02:42.639
ended to all the great
forthcoming books of my various

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.509
graduate students who are going
to solve that issue,

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.873
and I'm going to probably
suggest before we finish that

00:02:48.873 --> 00:02:53.091
it's never quite ended.
But listen to just a couple of

00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:57.261
the public commentaries,
that year, of America's

00:02:57.261 --> 00:03:02.939
centennial of independence and
what they were thinking about.

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.891
The New York Evening Post
announced:

00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:08.280
"The great work of the
century,"

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.374
it said, "is finished,
and the year which is about to

00:03:12.374 --> 00:03:17.019
dawn will be the very first one
wholly free from the duty of

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.720
dealing with the old and
dangerous subject.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.898
Slavery died in this country
ten years ago,

00:03:23.898 --> 00:03:28.211
but not until now have we
finished the work of readjusting

00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:31.919
our national life to the new
order of things.

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:35.899
Not until now have the
questions which grew out of

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:39.229
slavery been fully and finally
settled.

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:45.110
Not until now have the echoes
of the war died out of our

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.275
politics and our lives."
Just listen to how conclusive

00:03:51.275 --> 00:03:56.153
that is--it's over folks.
Or the Springfield

00:03:56.153 --> 00:03:59.663
Republican,
a Republican Party paper,

00:03:59.663 --> 00:04:04.491
an old abolitionist paper,
1876: "We must get rid of the

00:04:04.491 --> 00:04:09.457
Southern question.
There is no chance or hope of

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:13.930
healthy politics until we do get
rid of it.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.848
So long as the war issues are
capable of being warmed over,

00:04:17.848 --> 00:04:20.974
from year to year,
and election to election,

00:04:20.974 --> 00:04:24.948
so long as a large section of
the country is disturbed by

00:04:24.948 --> 00:04:28.000
violence and paralyzed by
misgovernment,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.226
so long as white is arrayed
against black,

00:04:31.226 --> 00:04:35.870
so long will our politics be
feverish with this disease."

00:04:41.829 --> 00:04:47.370
Multiple choice question:
what's the disease?

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.879
You can make up the answers and
you can pick.

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:57.136
Or the New York Times,
not a liberal paper in these

00:04:57.136 --> 00:05:01.691
years: "Ten years ago the North
was nearly united in a feeling

00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:06.171
of sympathy for the freedmen and
in a determination to defend

00:05:06.171 --> 00:05:10.435
their rights.
Now, not a few believe that the

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:16.310
rights of the whites are those
which have been infringed upon."

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.110
Historical memory is always a
contest, it's always a struggle,

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.170
it's always a battle,
a debate over who gets to own

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.621
it, control it,
narrate it, organize it,

00:05:36.621 --> 00:05:41.240
declare it.
And everybody was trying.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.161
But in Philadelphia they put on
the biggest show the United

00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:48.541
States had ever put on,
the biggest show the United

00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:52.301
States had ever attempted.
The United States Centennial

00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:55.579
Exposition in Philadelphia in
1876, throughout that,

00:05:55.579 --> 00:06:00.390
from spring all the way through
the fall, was attended by--it's

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.425
really almost hard to
believe--but it was attended by

00:06:04.425 --> 00:06:09.588
ten million people.
That was close to one-fourth of

00:06:09.588 --> 00:06:12.639
the entire U.S.
population.

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:18.599
Imagine today an exposition,
an event, attended--physically

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:23.839
now, not on the Internet and
television--attended by

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:27.787
one-quarter of us.
They had a wax replica of

00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:29.879
Cleopatra there,
a huge thing.

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:32.035
What the hell that had to do
with the U.S.

00:06:32.035 --> 00:06:34.512
Centennial, God only knows.
But you know,

00:06:34.512 --> 00:06:38.613
when you want to be a great
country you got to reach over

00:06:38.613 --> 00:06:41.470
history and back to classical
times.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.985
The great theme of the
exposition, of course,

00:06:43.985 --> 00:06:47.550
though, was machines.
It was the Machine Age.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.290
It was the excitement of
technology.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:57.471
They had a telephone there,
a typewriter,

00:06:57.471 --> 00:07:03.961
an electric light,
a new floor-cloth called

00:07:03.961 --> 00:07:08.949
linoleum.
They celebrated packaged yeast

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:14.906
and something called--are you
ready?--the internal combustion

00:07:14.906 --> 00:07:18.350
engine.
The Corliss steam engine.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.795
A gigantic thing,
it's now today in the

00:07:20.795 --> 00:07:23.626
Smithsonian, in Washington--you
can see this,

00:07:23.626 --> 00:07:28.000
it's an amazing thing.
It was 700 tons and forty-feet

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.420
high, and people looked at it in
awe.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:36.230
This thing was going to make
energy, for the future.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.086
Machines and technology,
it was said,

00:07:38.086 --> 00:07:40.871
over and over and over and
over, were remaking American

00:07:40.871 --> 00:07:42.681
society,
would remake its future,

00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:44.865
and would make the United
States the greatest

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:48.272
manufacturing,
industrial producing nation on

00:07:48.272 --> 00:07:51.060
earth.
True.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.860
All of this national
self-congratulation ignored or

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.220
masked some of the less admiral
features of American life.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.082
And of course it would.
You don't have a national

00:08:00.082 --> 00:08:03.329
centennial celebration and then
say, "Oh by the way,

00:08:03.329 --> 00:08:06.312
you can buy your ticket here to
celebrate and you can buy your

00:08:06.312 --> 00:08:08.610
ticket here to look at all of
our tragedies."

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:14.030
We don't do that, do we?
But it doesn't mean that

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:18.349
history's not happening.
The Pennsylvania and

00:08:18.349 --> 00:08:22.533
Massachusetts exhibitions--every
state had one--made no mention

00:08:22.533 --> 00:08:26.649
of the great labor strikes that
had just hit their states,

00:08:26.649 --> 00:08:29.786
even though twenty-seven of the
very textile mills that had just

00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:32.419
been struck in Fall River,
Massachusetts,

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:36.049
exhibited their wares at the
exposition.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:39.883
There was no mention whatsoever
of the enduring economic

00:08:39.883 --> 00:08:43.159
depression, which was still
going on in 1876.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:47.919
There was a Women's Pavilion,
added as an afterthought at the

00:08:47.919 --> 00:08:51.345
last minute.
It housed collections of

00:08:51.345 --> 00:08:56.940
needlework and weaving and
demonstrations of power looms.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.328
There were no mentions
whatsoever of women's political

00:09:00.328 --> 00:09:03.460
subordination or activism,
the crusade for women's

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.210
suffrage which was going on
everywhere.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.551
Women suffragists tried to be
recognized and to protest,

00:09:10.551 --> 00:09:15.230
in fact, at the exhibition;
weren't allowed to.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:20.980
Women's place in this was
essentially apolitical.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:25.068
For African Americans there
were no exhibits at all about

00:09:25.068 --> 00:09:27.623
them.
They were even excluded from

00:09:27.623 --> 00:09:31.200
the construction crews that
built all the halls.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.699
There was something called a
Southern Restaurant,

00:09:33.699 --> 00:09:35.990
which according to the
guidebook featured,

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:41.885
quote, "a band of old-time
plantation darkies performing

00:09:41.885 --> 00:09:44.483
songs."
There was a bale of Benjamin

00:09:44.483 --> 00:09:46.584
Montgomery's cotton,
from Davis Bend,

00:09:46.584 --> 00:09:49.268
Mississippi,
which won an agricultural medal

00:09:49.268 --> 00:09:51.894
at the exposition,
beating out cotton from all

00:09:51.894 --> 00:09:55.219
over the South and from Brazil
and from Egypt and the Fiji

00:09:55.219 --> 00:10:00.051
Islands and other places,
but no mention whatsoever made

00:10:00.051 --> 00:10:05.289
of the recent violent overthrow
of reconstruction in

00:10:05.289 --> 00:10:08.836
Mississippi.
American Indians were

00:10:08.836 --> 00:10:14.570
represented at the exposition
but almost exclusively depicted

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:20.015
as a people of the past,
or as harmless and primitive

00:10:20.015 --> 00:10:24.274
noble savages.
They were either a vanishing

00:10:24.274 --> 00:10:29.140
Indian or an Indian of a kind of
cultural mystique,

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:34.682
a deeply American mystique.
And then came the news right

00:10:34.682 --> 00:10:39.738
after the 4^(th) of July where
some real Indians rudely

00:10:39.738 --> 00:10:43.110
interrupted all the
celebrations.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:47.061
The news arrived that General
George Armstrong Custer had been

00:10:47.061 --> 00:10:51.359
defeated, indeed wiped out,
all his men killed--well almost

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:55.027
all--by the Sioux,
led by Sitting Bull and Crazy

00:10:55.027 --> 00:10:57.577
Horse,
at a place called Little

00:10:57.577 --> 00:10:59.877
Bighorn.
Custer's Last Stand,

00:10:59.877 --> 00:11:04.539
images of which would end up
behind the bar in every saloon

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:08.672
west of the Mississippi,
and a hell of a lot of them

00:11:08.672 --> 00:11:12.669
east of the Mississippi,
for the rest of that century.

00:11:12.669 --> 00:11:17.102
That victory for the Indians,
of course, would be a pyrrhic

00:11:17.102 --> 00:11:20.388
victory in their struggle to
hold onto land,

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:24.369
culture, place.
What was also occurring here,

00:11:24.369 --> 00:11:28.206
by 1876, of course,
the subtext of this great

00:11:28.206 --> 00:11:33.738
national celebration,
if not its central theme,

00:11:33.738 --> 00:11:40.201
was the sectional North/South
reunion, the great

00:11:40.201 --> 00:11:45.289
reconciliation from the Civil
War.

00:11:45.289 --> 00:11:50.509
Now one might say that's
inevitable, it had to happen.

00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:52.570
I said this at the beginning of
our whole unit on

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.502
Reconstruction,
the North and the South had to

00:11:54.502 --> 00:11:57.981
come back together.
The South wasn't going to go

00:11:57.981 --> 00:12:02.429
somewhere, you couldn't exile
them all to Brazil.

00:12:02.429 --> 00:12:07.224
But in that reconciliation,
as Faulkner said in that

00:12:07.224 --> 00:12:12.771
passage, there is a tremendous
amount of forgetting going on

00:12:12.771 --> 00:12:17.659
about that which people cannot
or will not cure.

00:12:17.659 --> 00:12:21.491
And what is going on in great
part is that peace among the

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:25.255
whites that Frederick Douglass
had worried about the year

00:12:25.255 --> 00:12:29.576
before, in 1875.
Back up with me now though to

00:12:29.576 --> 00:12:33.828
1874, at least quickly.
We're going to look at two

00:12:33.828 --> 00:12:36.855
elections today,
which kind of move us toward

00:12:36.855 --> 00:12:40.294
what we can at least call some
vestige of an end of

00:12:40.294 --> 00:12:43.461
Reconstruction.
The 1874 congressional

00:12:43.461 --> 00:12:48.265
elections took on a significance
that off-year congressional

00:12:48.265 --> 00:12:52.083
elections don't always have;
although we've had some of

00:12:52.083 --> 00:12:54.718
these kinds of off-year
congressional elections in our

00:12:54.718 --> 00:12:56.360
own lifetime,
in recent years.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.189
Like 1994, which you may or not
remember, when the Gingrich

00:12:59.189 --> 00:13:02.116
Republican movement took over
the Congress and after 40 years

00:13:02.116 --> 00:13:03.970
of Democratic rule they were
gone.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:11.403
And then in '06,
the Democrats take back both

00:13:11.403 --> 00:13:16.639
houses of Congress,
etcetera.

00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:21.356
In essence, the '74
congressional elections were a

00:13:21.356 --> 00:13:25.168
referendum on Reconstruction.
You'll remember the

00:13:25.168 --> 00:13:27.259
Slaughterhouse case had
come out in '73.

00:13:27.259 --> 00:13:30.306
The Depression had set in
surely by 1874,

00:13:30.306 --> 00:13:34.420
deeply, and certainly by the
fall elections of 1874.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:44.485
This became the great takeover
of Congress by the Democratic

00:13:44.485 --> 00:13:49.149
Party, so under duress since the
Civil War,

00:13:49.149 --> 00:13:52.283
since they had been the party,
in many ways,

00:13:52.283 --> 00:13:56.656
that had not favored the war
for the Union or the war to free

00:13:56.656 --> 00:14:00.402
the slaves.
And its coverage in the press

00:14:00.402 --> 00:14:04.647
after this tells it all.
The Buffalo Advertiser

00:14:04.647 --> 00:14:07.858
says, in the wake of it,
its headline:

00:14:07.858 --> 00:14:11.929
"Republican Party Struck by
Lightening," it said.

00:14:11.929 --> 00:14:16.047
Or another newspaper,
the Louisville Courier

00:14:16.047 --> 00:14:20.253
Journal, a Democratic paper,
said, headline:

00:14:20.253 --> 00:14:24.550
"Busted, the Radical Machine
Gone to Smash."

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:31.440
But what happened was this.
The Democrats captured the

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.450
House of Representatives.
It went from a Republican

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:40.545
majority of 110--that's how many
more Republicans there were than

00:14:40.545 --> 00:14:43.809
Democrats on the eve of this
election.

00:14:43.809 --> 00:14:48.196
This is the Republican Party
now that has run Congress,

00:14:48.196 --> 00:14:51.039
since Abraham Lincoln's
election.

00:14:51.039 --> 00:14:55.385
For the whole Civil War and
Reconstruction it's been a

00:14:55.385 --> 00:14:59.976
Republican Congress.
They went from a Republican

00:14:59.976 --> 00:15:05.961
majority of 110 overnight to a
Democratic Party majority of

00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:09.144
sixty.
In the wake of the election

00:15:09.144 --> 00:15:14.320
there were 109 Republicans left
and there were 169 Democrats.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.908
And it upset patterns,
the election did,

00:15:16.908 --> 00:15:20.027
in state after state after
state, that were two,

00:15:20.027 --> 00:15:24.009
at least two decades old,
in American political culture.

00:15:24.009 --> 00:15:30.299
Democrats took back a small
majority of the Senate.

00:15:30.299 --> 00:15:33.549
But at the state and local
level it was just as important.

00:15:33.549 --> 00:15:36.428
Democrats won the Governor's
Office in New York and

00:15:36.428 --> 00:15:38.946
Massachusetts;
in fact, they won the

00:15:38.946 --> 00:15:43.279
Governor's Office in something
like twenty-three states.

00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:49.481
Of thirty-five states holding
elections, twenty-three state

00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:54.400
legislatures went to Democrats.
Southerners now,

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.702
with their party,
the Democratic Party,

00:15:57.702 --> 00:16:02.742
which was now a national party,
no longer have to feel like

00:16:02.742 --> 00:16:07.623
aliens in their native land.
And this is what newspapers all

00:16:07.623 --> 00:16:10.350
over the place kept writing,
over and over,

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.360
in celebration.
Listen to this one.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:18.722
This was a Tennessee paper,
a Nashville paper,

00:16:18.722 --> 00:16:25.934
which said, I quote:
"The recent election was not an

00:16:25.934 --> 00:16:31.590
election," said the Tennessee
paper.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:36.250
"It was a country coming to a
halt and changing front.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.627
The whole scheme of
Reconstruction stands before the

00:16:39.627 --> 00:16:43.269
country today a naked,
confessed, stupendous failure;

00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:48.539
at once the most remarkable and
the most inexcusable failure in

00:16:48.539 --> 00:16:51.829
all of history."
A little hyperbole,

00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:54.742
but making their case.
The cause is,

00:16:54.742 --> 00:16:58.054
of course, relatively obvious,
but it was still a shock,

00:16:58.054 --> 00:17:01.243
certainly to Republicans.
There was tremendous fatigue

00:17:01.243 --> 00:17:03.605
with the reformist--in the
political culture,

00:17:03.605 --> 00:17:07.153
including the North,
or especially the North--there

00:17:07.153 --> 00:17:12.087
was tremendous political fatigue
with the reformist spirit of the

00:17:12.087 --> 00:17:16.341
Republican Party.
The economic depression was

00:17:16.341 --> 00:17:21.966
absolutely central to this
election and why the Dems came

00:17:21.966 --> 00:17:24.256
back.
The scandals and mismanagement

00:17:24.256 --> 00:17:26.190
of the Grant years already
setting in.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:29.461
It was a big deal by '74;
it's going to be an even bigger

00:17:29.461 --> 00:17:31.587
deal by 1876.
The Democrats are going to

00:17:31.587 --> 00:17:33.714
portray themselves now as the
Reform Party,

00:17:33.714 --> 00:17:36.349
the party of civil service
reform, the party of clean

00:17:36.349 --> 00:17:37.160
government.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:45.445
Most of all,
I'd say, the Republican Party

00:17:45.445 --> 00:17:49.610
by 1874--and how many times have
you seen this in American

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:53.556
political history?--the
Republican Party of 1874 paid a

00:17:53.556 --> 00:17:57.355
high price for its recent
history of support of black

00:17:57.355 --> 00:18:00.789
rights and the idea of racial
equality.

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:05.371
Just exactly as the Democratic
Party would do in the wake of

00:18:05.371 --> 00:18:09.578
LBJ's Great Society,
the '64 and '65 Civil Rights

00:18:09.578 --> 00:18:14.843
Acts, the famous moment when
Bill Moyers tells us--or was it

00:18:14.843 --> 00:18:19.419
Bill Moyers who said to LBJ;
was it LBJ that said to Bill

00:18:19.419 --> 00:18:22.780
Moyers, after they passed the
'65 Civil Rights Act;

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:27.355
which way was it?
It's LBJ to Bill Moyers,

00:18:27.355 --> 00:18:30.868
as only LBJ could.
He probably said

00:18:30.868 --> 00:18:33.650
something--well I'll clean it
up.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:38.761
"Well Bill, we've done lost the
South for a generation,

00:18:38.761 --> 00:18:41.980
because of what we just
passed."

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:45.000
And LBJ will only live to 1971,
of course;

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.650
he won't live to quite see it,
but he was absolutely right.

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.857
Southern redemption kept
happening, although seven of the

00:18:54.857 --> 00:18:58.293
eleven Southern ex-Confederate
states were already back under

00:18:58.293 --> 00:19:01.100
the control of the Southern
Democratic Party,

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.409
even before this.
Now in the wake of this

00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:07.432
election--one more will come
more the next year,

00:19:07.432 --> 00:19:10.713
and only three will be left,
by the '76 presidential

00:19:10.713 --> 00:19:12.902
contest;
South Carolina,

00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:18.220
Mississippi and Louisiana
unredeemed, as the South put it.

00:19:24.369 --> 00:19:32.024
This was an election also all
about this emerging reunion,

00:19:32.024 --> 00:19:36.589
or reconciliation,
of some kind.

00:19:36.589 --> 00:19:42.387
Let me give you a couple of
illustrations of what happened

00:19:42.387 --> 00:19:46.415
in the wake of this election.
In Vicksburg,

00:19:46.415 --> 00:19:48.908
Mississippi,
the following summer--and

00:19:48.908 --> 00:19:51.873
there's actually,
there's a bit about this in

00:19:51.873 --> 00:19:54.778
Nick Lemann's book,
which you're reading,

00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:58.154
and I'm sparing you any
lecturing about what happened in

00:19:58.154 --> 00:20:01.774
Mississippi in 1875 because
that's what Lemann's book is all

00:20:01.774 --> 00:20:04.270
about,
the so-called Shotgun Policy,

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.472
the violent overthrow of
Reconstruction by the white

00:20:07.472 --> 00:20:11.180
Democratic Party in Mississippi.
But in Vicksburg,

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:15.534
Vicksburg of all places,
blacks held a very public

00:20:15.534 --> 00:20:20.599
4^(th) of July celebration in
1875, and that took courage,

00:20:20.599 --> 00:20:24.740
it was bold.
Their own politicians spoke.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:28.930
A black Republican circuit
judge gave a speech.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:33.853
The black secretary of state in
Mississippi gave a remarkable

00:20:33.853 --> 00:20:38.529
speech, a somewhat challenging
speech to the Democrats.

00:20:38.529 --> 00:20:43.701
And just as he was ending his
speech a mob of about fifty

00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:49.150
white people invaded the big
hall they were having it in,

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:54.368
and a shot was fired as a
signal, and they opened up,

00:20:54.368 --> 00:20:59.785
and they just started firing.
They killed two on the spot,

00:20:59.785 --> 00:21:02.750
wounded about ten,
that died later.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:06.862
It was a 4^(th) of July
celebration, stopped by

00:21:06.862 --> 00:21:10.651
cold-blooded murder.
There was an observer,

00:21:10.651 --> 00:21:13.466
at this event,
an African-American,

00:21:13.466 --> 00:21:18.539
who wrote an account of it,
under the pseudonym Veni Vidi,

00:21:18.539 --> 00:21:22.769
which means I came,
I saw, and it was published in

00:21:22.769 --> 00:21:26.049
the New York Herald
Tribune,

00:21:26.049 --> 00:21:28.801
as well as the Christian
Recorder and some other

00:21:28.801 --> 00:21:33.019
places.
He laid the blame for this not

00:21:33.019 --> 00:21:37.200
on that white mob.
I mean, they were tired of

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.940
blaming white rednecks in the
South for killing them.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:45.349
Veni Vidi blamed it on national
reconciliation.

00:21:45.349 --> 00:21:48.513
He said the killings on the
4^(th) of July in Vicksburg were

00:21:48.513 --> 00:21:52.247
because,
quote, "Boston and Ohio were

00:21:52.247 --> 00:21:59.099
holding the coats for Georgia
and Mississippi while they slay

00:21:59.099 --> 00:22:06.180
the common victim of northern
prejudice and southern hate."

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.664
That's a very clear,
on the ground,

00:22:09.664 --> 00:22:16.019
eyewitness description of where
responsibility now for this may

00:22:16.019 --> 00:22:20.457
lie;
not just with the mob but with

00:22:20.457 --> 00:22:26.970
the folk who are allowing the
mob to do its business.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:32.537
All right, between 1874 and
1876 arguably what the country

00:22:32.537 --> 00:22:38.396
is assessing--and you can see
who's winning--what the country

00:22:38.396 --> 00:22:44.233
is assessing is the question,
which revolution is actually

00:22:44.233 --> 00:22:47.286
going to win?
If this is a second American

00:22:47.286 --> 00:22:50.655
Revolution, which is a
construction historians have put

00:22:50.655 --> 00:22:53.650
onto this over time,
with different meanings;

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:56.561
Charles Beard had a different
meaning than Eric Foner,

00:22:56.561 --> 00:23:00.333
and others of us have used it.
But which revolution would

00:23:00.333 --> 00:23:04.181
prevail?
Is it the revolution of 1863 to

00:23:04.181 --> 00:23:06.783
'65?
Is it the revolution that

00:23:06.783 --> 00:23:11.138
Abraham Lincoln finally named,
and then said would be

00:23:11.138 --> 00:23:15.410
enforced, very bluntly,
in his Second Inaugural?

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:21.225
"With every drop of blood shed
by the lash it shall be paid in

00:23:21.225 --> 00:23:25.794
blood shed by the sword."
Or is it the other revolution,

00:23:25.794 --> 00:23:29.250
the counter-revolution,
the white Southern Democratic

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.710
revolution against
Reconstruction,

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.692
against the changes of the
Civil War, against the

00:23:34.692 --> 00:23:37.800
Thirteenth, Fourteenth and
Fifteenth Amendments?

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:43.275
Which revolution?
The revolution of black freedom

00:23:43.275 --> 00:23:47.670
or the redemption of white
supremacy?

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:50.237
Those are the stakes.
Those are very,

00:23:50.237 --> 00:23:51.470
very high stakes.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:04.579
In fact, just let me use a
picture or two for the heck of

00:24:04.579 --> 00:24:08.899
it.
This may go without saying,

00:24:08.899 --> 00:24:13.338
but not really.
Which image did Americans,

00:24:13.338 --> 00:24:15.739
white Americans,
which image,

00:24:15.739 --> 00:24:18.740
in their minds,
in their brains,

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:23.875
when they went to the
polls--what image when we go to

00:24:23.875 --> 00:24:29.900
the polls now do most white
Americans want of black people?

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:34.997
Is it him?
Is it that genius in his

00:24:34.997 --> 00:24:41.940
perfect white shirts who could
speak and write like Goethe,

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:46.018
and would remind you of it,
and would explain things in

00:24:46.018 --> 00:24:49.869
language that might make you
quiver in your seat?

00:24:49.869 --> 00:24:54.329
Is it black genius they wanted
to see?

00:24:54.329 --> 00:25:02.839
Or--I don't know if you can see
that--did they want to see Chloe

00:25:02.839 --> 00:25:05.395
and Sam?
It's a painting by Thomas

00:25:05.395 --> 00:25:08.574
Hovenden, a wonderful painter.
He's the same painter who

00:25:08.574 --> 00:25:12.685
painted that colossal painting
of John Brown with the rifle in

00:25:12.685 --> 00:25:16.460
one hand and the Bible in the
other and hair on fire;

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.349
it's at the Metropolitan Museum
in New York, go see it.

00:25:19.349 --> 00:25:22.586
Anyway, Hovenden's painting
here, a beautiful,

00:25:22.586 --> 00:25:26.902
a sentimental--I'm not sure how
carefully you can see this or

00:25:26.902 --> 00:25:30.930
how well you can see this with
the lighting in here.

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:34.849
It's Chloe and Sam,
it's two old freedmen.

00:25:34.849 --> 00:25:41.290
Sam seems to be cooling down
the teapot maybe.

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:45.830
Chloe's ironing.
They got their own house.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:51.579
He hunts.
They're peaceful,

00:25:51.579 --> 00:25:58.940
they're settled.
They're the old slaves.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:03.162
There's Aunt Chloe and Uncle
Sam, and they're not going to

00:26:03.162 --> 00:26:04.570
threaten anybody.

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:16.104
Well forgive this image,
this is--I don't know who drew

00:26:16.104 --> 00:26:22.220
this, it just comes from the
Library of Congress.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:26.610
Or is this an image now that a
lot of Americans,

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:31.375
they may not prefer it,
but are certainly willing to

00:26:31.375 --> 00:26:36.700
accept about the sons and
daughters of Chloe and Sam,

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.488
who got really assertive,
who wanted to vote,

00:26:39.488 --> 00:26:42.594
who were holding office,
who were walking in their

00:26:42.594 --> 00:26:46.397
perfect white shirts and their
suits in the halls of Congress

00:26:46.397 --> 00:26:49.059
and the halls of state
legislatures,

00:26:49.059 --> 00:26:53.933
who insisted on education and
property ownership and all those

00:26:53.933 --> 00:26:56.330
crazy rights of citizenship?

00:27:01.089 --> 00:27:05.759
Where should black people be in
that imagination?

00:27:05.759 --> 00:27:08.720
All right, the election of 1876
comes.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:13.426
If the election of 1874 was a
referendum on Reconstruction,

00:27:13.426 --> 00:27:17.482
the election of 1876 was a
referendum, if you like,

00:27:17.482 --> 00:27:20.588
on reunion.
How indeed would this reunion

00:27:20.588 --> 00:27:23.331
actually occur?
Would there really truly be a

00:27:23.331 --> 00:27:25.611
reunion?
Now this was an election,

00:27:25.611 --> 00:27:29.675
of course, where both parties
now, for the first time since

00:27:29.675 --> 00:27:33.669
the Civil--well for the first
time really since before the

00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:37.198
Civil War.
In fact you certainly could

00:27:37.198 --> 00:27:42.339
argue that it's the first time
since really 1856 that two

00:27:42.339 --> 00:27:47.296
parties in an American
presidential election have faced

00:27:47.296 --> 00:27:53.079
each other as truly national and
virtually equal in power,

00:27:53.079 --> 00:28:03.370
authority, membership to some
degree, and so on.

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:07.440
It's the Centennial year.
It comes in the wake of these

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.089
tremendous scandals of the
second Grant Administration.

00:28:11.089 --> 00:28:14.160
The Whiskey Ring wasn't blown
open until the second term.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.613
Crédit Mobilier wasn't
blown open 'till the second

00:28:16.613 --> 00:28:18.723
term;
the Belknap Scandal not 'till

00:28:18.723 --> 00:28:20.761
the second term.
The Democrats now,

00:28:20.761 --> 00:28:23.597
in '76, they're going to
portray themselves again--as

00:28:23.597 --> 00:28:26.814
they had in '74 but now it's a
presidential election--as the

00:28:26.814 --> 00:28:30.115
party of reform,
the party of clean government

00:28:30.115 --> 00:28:34.054
and, thank you very much,
the party of white supremacy

00:28:34.054 --> 00:28:37.844
that'll finally put
Reconstruction to death in those

00:28:37.844 --> 00:28:42.750
three states in the South where
it still exists in some form.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:47.513
The election was a test of
either reunion or redemption and

00:28:47.513 --> 00:28:50.852
on whose terms.
The Democrats ran for president

00:28:50.852 --> 00:28:51.980
Samuel J.
Tilden.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:56.475
He was the governor of New York.
Governors of New York have

00:28:56.475 --> 00:29:00.016
often been candidates for
president for a whole variety of

00:29:00.016 --> 00:29:02.704
good reasons.
He was one of the richest men

00:29:02.704 --> 00:29:07.939
in the United States.
He was a very wealthy trial

00:29:07.939 --> 00:29:11.606
lawyer.
He had a reputation for reform

00:29:11.606 --> 00:29:16.684
based largely on the fact that
he had gone--as the governor of

00:29:16.684 --> 00:29:20.180
New York--he had gone after Boss
Tweed,

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:23.599
who ran the boss system of New
York City, and as the press

00:29:23.599 --> 00:29:25.460
always put it,
he bagged him,

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:28.940
he got him.
He found him--he got him on

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.602
charges.
They were able to prosecute

00:29:31.602 --> 00:29:37.989
against Boss Tweed.
So Tilden cleaned up New York,

00:29:37.989 --> 00:29:44.406
they said, to some degree.
Now the Republicans,

00:29:44.406 --> 00:29:48.439
on the other hand,
now needed a new face,

00:29:48.439 --> 00:29:53.480
somebody untainted by the Grant
Administration,

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:58.009
and somebody who had some
distance from Reconstruction.

00:29:58.009 --> 00:30:03.180
But it was still terribly
important to run a veteran.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:06.587
And this is going to be the
case for years in American

00:30:06.587 --> 00:30:07.977
history.
In the South,

00:30:07.977 --> 00:30:11.082
you couldn't get elected a
governor or a senator from a

00:30:11.082 --> 00:30:14.072
southern state for the next 25
years if you weren't a

00:30:14.072 --> 00:30:17.280
Confederate veteran.
And it surely helped you in the

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.279
North if you were a Union
veteran.

00:30:19.279 --> 00:30:24.710
So they went to Ohio,
that seedbed of presidents--no

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:30.035
more jokes about Ohio--and they
found Rutherford B.

00:30:30.035 --> 00:30:33.518
Hayes.
Now Hayes had many things going

00:30:33.518 --> 00:30:35.590
for him.
He had indeed been a Civil

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:39.423
War--he was a Civil War veteran.
He'd been wounded about six

00:30:39.423 --> 00:30:43.231
times in the war.
He was a serious combat

00:30:43.231 --> 00:30:46.485
survivor.
He'd also been elected Governor

00:30:46.485 --> 00:30:49.221
of Ohio three times.
He was known to be a

00:30:49.221 --> 00:30:51.457
conservative,
not terribly engaged in

00:30:51.457 --> 00:30:55.825
Reconstruction issues.
Oh, he supported black rights

00:30:55.825 --> 00:31:00.719
in some sort of general way.
He will promise something for

00:31:00.719 --> 00:31:03.803
almost everyone,
depending on where he went,

00:31:03.803 --> 00:31:07.768
in the vaguest possible terms,
and he will inspire,

00:31:07.768 --> 00:31:11.045
once again, that cynical SOB,
Henry Adams,

00:31:11.045 --> 00:31:14.961
for one of the best
descriptions I've ever read of

00:31:14.961 --> 00:31:17.896
Rutherford Hayes.
A little unfair,

00:31:17.896 --> 00:31:20.470
as Adams always was as a
satirist.

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:24.855
Henry Adams said Rutherford
Hayes was a, quote,

00:31:24.855 --> 00:31:28.001
"third-rate,
non-entity whose only

00:31:28.001 --> 00:31:33.150
recommendation is that he is
obnoxious to no one."

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:37.174
You know, how many times have
we done this in our politics

00:31:37.174 --> 00:31:41.153
though?
Find somebody that nobody quite

00:31:41.153 --> 00:31:46.438
knows, doesn't have a lot of
enemies, got elected,

00:31:46.438 --> 00:31:49.890
no strong views,
and run him;

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:52.696
yes, and provided you don't
have a year and a half bloody

00:31:52.696 --> 00:31:54.150
primary to put him through.

00:31:58.799 --> 00:32:04.158
Now, this would be a brutal,
brutal election,

00:32:04.158 --> 00:32:10.670
in its rhetoric.
Just an example or two.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:14.396
Republicans now,
facing this frankly virulently,

00:32:14.396 --> 00:32:18.440
openly white supremacist
campaign on the part of the

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.557
Democrats,
but also facing the charges of

00:32:21.557 --> 00:32:24.569
scandal and corruption,
which are very real,

00:32:24.569 --> 00:32:27.920
they want to misdirect
people's, their attention.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.231
They don't want people to think
about those scandals,

00:32:30.231 --> 00:32:32.809
and if they can help it they
don't even want people to have

00:32:32.809 --> 00:32:34.810
to think about Reconstruction
for awhile.

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:39.220
So what do they do?
They wave the bloody shirt.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:42.069
When in doubt in the nineteenth
century, for the Republican--and

00:32:42.069 --> 00:32:44.692
they're going to keep doing it
right on up through the 1896

00:32:44.692 --> 00:32:47.640
election,
against William Jennings Bryan;

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.160
that's getting ahead of
ourselves.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.271
But man, they're going to trot
out every living,

00:32:53.271 --> 00:32:55.920
surviving, sentient Civil War
general,

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.431
by as late as 1896,
put them on trains and

00:32:58.431 --> 00:33:00.759
barnstorm them all over the
country,

00:33:00.759 --> 00:33:05.433
and paint William Jennings
Bryan as a secessionist,

00:33:05.433 --> 00:33:08.772
because he was a populist.
At any rate,

00:33:08.772 --> 00:33:12.325
here's one example of the kind
of bloody shirt rhetoric that

00:33:12.325 --> 00:33:16.299
the Republican Party trotted out
against the Democrats in 1876.

00:33:16.299 --> 00:33:22.099
This came from Colonel Robert
Ingersoll, a famous agnostic;

00:33:22.099 --> 00:33:26.150
a very popular orator,
especially at Grand Army of the

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:29.589
Republic reunions and political
gatherings.

00:33:29.589 --> 00:33:31.460
He said this in September of
'76.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:36.174
Quote--classic bloody shirt:
"Every state that seceded from

00:33:36.174 --> 00:33:39.670
the United States was a
Democratic state.

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:44.609
Every man that tried to destroy
this nation was a Democrat.

00:33:44.609 --> 00:33:49.313
Every man that loved slavery
better than liberty was a

00:33:49.313 --> 00:33:51.816
Democrat.
The man that assassinated

00:33:51.816 --> 00:33:55.237
Abraham Lincoln was a Democrat.
Every man that raised

00:33:55.237 --> 00:33:58.799
bloodhounds to pursue human
beings was a Democrat.

00:33:58.799 --> 00:34:03.650
Soldiers, every scar you have
got on your heroic bodies was

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:09.256
given to you by a Democrat."
And those Union veterans would

00:34:09.256 --> 00:34:12.249
get up and cheer,
"Yay, scars,

00:34:12.249 --> 00:34:15.137
Democrat scars."
[Laughter]

00:34:15.137 --> 00:34:18.940
It worked, it worked in a lot
of places.

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:23.307
The war is only ten years ago,
and there are hundreds of

00:34:23.307 --> 00:34:27.331
thousands of Union veterans.
They are the base of the

00:34:27.331 --> 00:34:29.793
Republican Party,
a deep, broad base,

00:34:29.793 --> 00:34:33.623
especially across the Midwest,
which is where they're all

00:34:33.623 --> 00:34:38.738
moving, and in the far West;
Civil War veterans are moving

00:34:38.738 --> 00:34:42.082
west.
In the election again the

00:34:42.082 --> 00:34:48.687
rhetoric got terrible and when
the election was held it was a

00:34:48.687 --> 00:34:52.618
very violent election.
We'll never know,

00:34:52.618 --> 00:34:55.598
no one will ever know,
how many thousands of

00:34:55.598 --> 00:34:59.476
African-American voters,
especially in the three states

00:34:59.476 --> 00:35:01.751
of Mississippi,
Louisiana and South

00:35:01.751 --> 00:35:04.130
Carolina--excuse me,
Mississippi,

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:08.335
South Carolina and Louisiana as
well, but also Florida--we'll

00:35:08.335 --> 00:35:12.049
never know how many were
intimidated and kept from the

00:35:12.049 --> 00:35:14.634
polls.
We know it was thousands,

00:35:14.634 --> 00:35:17.610
hundreds of thousands in all
likelihood.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:22.643
One Republican official in
Mississippi, observing the

00:35:22.643 --> 00:35:28.644
election, said in his view the
white population was essentially

00:35:28.644 --> 00:35:31.965
one vast mob.
Now what happened,

00:35:31.965 --> 00:35:37.084
of course, is that Tilden
carried all of--a map here may

00:35:37.084 --> 00:35:42.948
be useful--Tilden--I don't know
how well you can see that but at

00:35:42.948 --> 00:35:47.230
least you see the contours of
it--Tilden,

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:50.648
the Democrat,
carried all of the solid South

00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:55.260
except--now solid Democratic
South--except three states,

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:59.358
the three states remaining
under teetering Republican

00:35:59.358 --> 00:36:03.219
regimes, Louisiana,
South Carolina and Florida.

00:36:03.219 --> 00:36:05.760
Tilden also carried four
northern states:

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.680
his own, New York;
New Jersey;

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.090
Connecticut;
and Indiana.

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:17.949
Hayes carried all the rest of
the North and much of the West.

00:36:17.949 --> 00:36:25.907
But without the three southern
states counted,

00:36:25.907 --> 00:36:32.980
Louisiana, Florida and South
Carolina,

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:37.160
the electoral count--and when
the returns came in,

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:41.164
that night and the next day;
and it took longer in those

00:36:41.164 --> 00:36:43.786
years, it took at least
twenty-four hours after an

00:36:43.786 --> 00:36:47.610
election ended,
and sometimes forty-eight hours

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:51.670
before they even had real,
official counts.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:57.189
In the Electoral College--now
first of all there's no question

00:36:57.189 --> 00:37:02.889
that at least in the votes cast,
Tilden won the popular vote.

00:37:02.889 --> 00:37:04.691
If you like,
in terms of numbers,

00:37:04.691 --> 00:37:07.843
he's the Al Gore of the 1876
election, he won the popular

00:37:07.843 --> 00:37:10.854
vote, of the votes cast.
Now how many hundreds of

00:37:10.854 --> 00:37:14.440
thousands, particularly of black
Republicans who didn't vote,

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:17.010
for fear for their lives,
we don't know.

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:20.476
In the Electoral College,
before you count the three

00:37:20.476 --> 00:37:23.330
disputed states,
the number was 184 to 166,

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:29.150
Tilden to Hayes.
It took 185 to be elected.

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:32.772
The handwriting on the wall
initially was that--well,

00:37:32.772 --> 00:37:37.300
even in the official Republican
Party offices in Washington DC,

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.632
as the returns were coming in
the next day,

00:37:39.632 --> 00:37:42.019
they were about to hold news
conferences,

00:37:42.019 --> 00:37:47.349
send out messages and say,
"Well guys, guess we lost."

00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:51.184
And then quickly,
quickly, inside their offices,

00:37:51.184 --> 00:37:56.078
they realized that there were
nineteen electoral votes in the

00:37:56.078 --> 00:37:58.938
three disputed states,
and they said,

00:37:58.938 --> 00:38:01.312
"No news conferences,
we're going to win those

00:38:01.312 --> 00:38:04.280
three."
How?

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:09.004
Well that remains to be seen.
The disputed election of 1876

00:38:09.004 --> 00:38:12.003
was disputed over the three
states, that still had

00:38:12.003 --> 00:38:15.160
Republican regimes,
that had widespread fraud,

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.989
violence and intimidation
practice in their elections.

00:38:18.989 --> 00:38:21.587
No one will ever know,
as long as we live,

00:38:21.587 --> 00:38:24.819
exactly who won where,
although we do have some good

00:38:24.819 --> 00:38:29.595
guesses now from scholarship.
But what ensued was the longest

00:38:29.595 --> 00:38:32.539
disputed election we've ever
had.

00:38:32.539 --> 00:38:35.566
The Gore/Bush affair of 2000
lasted, what,

00:38:35.566 --> 00:38:39.256
thirty-five days before the
Supreme Court chose our

00:38:39.256 --> 00:38:42.513
president.
It isn't going to be a lot

00:38:42.513 --> 00:38:46.447
different here,
although the Supreme Court will

00:38:46.447 --> 00:38:50.995
have only a very limited role.
The official popular vote count

00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:53.889
in 1876 was four million,
two-hundred and eighty-four

00:38:53.889 --> 00:38:56.949
thousand-some odd votes for
Tilden and four million,

00:38:56.949 --> 00:39:01.170
thirty-six thousand and some
odd votes for Hayes.

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:05.789
That was an official popular
vote.

00:39:05.789 --> 00:39:09.394
One of the best ways to think
about this election is that

00:39:09.394 --> 00:39:13.257
frankly the Democrats stole it
and then the Republicans stole

00:39:13.257 --> 00:39:16.045
it back.
I hate to sound so cynical but

00:39:16.045 --> 00:39:19.269
frankly folks that's essentially
what happened.

00:39:19.269 --> 00:39:21.217
Under the Twelfth Amendment to
the U.S.

00:39:21.217 --> 00:39:23.061
Constitution,
of course, if there's a

00:39:23.061 --> 00:39:26.136
disputed election and no one
gets a majority of the Electoral

00:39:26.136 --> 00:39:28.340
College--we ignored this one in
2000;

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:31.597
I just thought I'd point that
out--it is supposed to go to the

00:39:31.597 --> 00:39:34.134
House of Representatives,
and the House of

00:39:34.134 --> 00:39:36.666
Representatives,
in its good councils,

00:39:36.666 --> 00:39:40.469
shall choose the President,
says the U.S. Constitution.

00:39:40.469 --> 00:39:45.380
They followed the Constitution
in 1876, they actually did;

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:52.080
well, to a degree they did.
With the country waiting,

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:56.401
with all kinds of rumors flying
in the press--I went back and

00:39:56.401 --> 00:40:00.577
studied the press in these
disputed months for this earlier

00:40:00.577 --> 00:40:04.179
book I did on memory,
and it's amazing the rumors.

00:40:04.179 --> 00:40:07.442
You've got southern papers like
the Atlanta Constitution

00:40:07.442 --> 00:40:10.389
printing long stories about
local militias in upstate New

00:40:10.389 --> 00:40:13.792
York that are drilling,
calling themselves the Sons of

00:40:13.792 --> 00:40:17.360
Liberty, readying themselves to
march into the South.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.860
And you've got northern papers
like the Chicago Tribune

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:24.074
printing article after article
about Confederate mobs and

00:40:24.074 --> 00:40:26.010
militias,
they're drilling all over the

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:28.309
South and preparing themselves
to march into the North;

00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:32.780
most of which were completely
false.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:39.150
But it became long,
tense, winter months of fear.

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:43.744
And now, of course,
when fear sets in,

00:40:43.744 --> 00:40:48.047
blood memory sets in.
The United States House of

00:40:48.047 --> 00:40:50.720
Representatives decided to
establish an Electoral

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:53.619
Commission.
It would have 15 members.

00:40:53.619 --> 00:40:58.387
There would be five
Republicans, five Democrats,

00:40:58.387 --> 00:41:03.460
and five Supreme Court
Justices--fifteen people.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:08.739
Sounds relatively fair.
Not quite.

00:41:08.739 --> 00:41:11.417
Three of the Supreme Court
Justices were Republicans,

00:41:11.417 --> 00:41:13.991
two of them were Democrats.
That means there eight

00:41:13.991 --> 00:41:17.039
Republicans and seven Democrats
on this Electoral Commission.

00:41:17.039 --> 00:41:21.095
The job of this Electoral
Commission was to investigate

00:41:21.095 --> 00:41:25.601
the voting returns of the three
disputed states of Louisiana,

00:41:25.601 --> 00:41:31.940
Florida and South Carolina.
They were to study the returns.

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:37.092
The Democrats in Congress
initiated a long filibuster,

00:41:37.092 --> 00:41:41.401
and they held it.
They started a filibuster in

00:41:41.401 --> 00:41:45.269
December of '76 and they're
still doing it.

00:41:45.269 --> 00:41:48.089
They're reading city
directories and whatever other

00:41:48.089 --> 00:41:50.570
garbage--they didn't have phone
books yet.

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:55.108
They were just reading
newspaper articles,

00:41:55.108 --> 00:42:00.310
day in and day out,
until the third week--fourth

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:06.671
week of February of '77.
Nothing went on in the U.S.

00:42:06.671 --> 00:42:10.250
Congress.
There were threats of disunion.

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:16.754
Hot-headed Democrats would
announce the slogan 'Tilden or

00:42:16.754 --> 00:42:19.476
fight.'
President Ulysses Grant,

00:42:19.476 --> 00:42:22.550
lame duck, can't wait to get
out of office;

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:27.429
already has his ship booked for
his grand tour around the world.

00:42:27.429 --> 00:42:32.464
He'll leave on May 17^(th) for
the greatest tour any American

00:42:32.464 --> 00:42:36.659
ever made of Planet
Earth--that's another story.

00:42:36.659 --> 00:42:42.581
But Grant quietly began to
rebuild and re-garrison some of

00:42:42.581 --> 00:42:47.611
the forts around Washington DC.
And lo and behold,

00:42:47.611 --> 00:42:52.060
the commission met,
and lo and behold they voted.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:57.610
Guess what?
It's a suspense.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:02.616
They voted eight to seven that
the Republican,

00:43:02.616 --> 00:43:09.070
Hayes, had won in Louisiana,
Florida and South Carolina,

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:12.210
based on the theory of
widespread fraud and violence.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:18.403
Now there's a lot to that.
They never really knew what

00:43:18.403 --> 00:43:21.550
those voting counts were,
to be honest.

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:24.845
But the way in which the
disputed election of 1876 was

00:43:24.845 --> 00:43:27.955
settled, of course,
was ultimately not even by that

00:43:27.955 --> 00:43:32.018
Electoral Commission.
It was settled in the Wormley

00:43:32.018 --> 00:43:35.909
Hotel, on February 26th and
27^(th) of 1877,

00:43:35.909 --> 00:43:39.848
in a forty-eight hour meeting
between five Ohio Republicans,

00:43:39.848 --> 00:43:43.067
representing Hayes,
and four Southern Democrats,

00:43:43.067 --> 00:43:47.048
representing Tilden.
The Compromise of 1877,

00:43:47.048 --> 00:43:50.349
as it is called,
was a deal.

00:43:50.349 --> 00:43:57.519
It was a deal based on
interests, not on votes.

00:43:57.519 --> 00:44:02.692
The Democrats were willing to
give up the presidency if they

00:44:02.692 --> 00:44:06.550
could get in return what they
most needed.

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:11.017
They wanted federal subsidies
for a Western Pacific Railroad,

00:44:11.017 --> 00:44:14.070
at least one,
with a southern terminus.

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:16.230
They wanted their harbors
dredged.

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:19.614
They wanted federal subsidies
to rebuild the infrastructure of

00:44:19.614 --> 00:44:21.386
the South.
Lo and behold,

00:44:21.386 --> 00:44:24.859
they wanted federal money;
all these states' rights

00:44:24.859 --> 00:44:27.036
southern Democrats,
thank you very much,

00:44:27.036 --> 00:44:30.050
they wanted federal money to
rebuild their society.

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:33.207
"Bring us your investments,"
they'd been saying for a long

00:44:33.207 --> 00:44:36.032
time to carpetbaggers,
"just don't come here and try

00:44:36.032 --> 00:44:37.140
to get elected."

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:45.063
Here was the deal.
And by the way,

00:44:45.063 --> 00:44:48.343
one of the chief brokers,
there were several chief

00:44:48.343 --> 00:44:51.140
brokers.
One was James Garfield,

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:55.439
of Ohio, a close personal
friend and associate of

00:44:55.439 --> 00:44:57.500
Rutherford B.
Hayes;

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:01.556
later succeeded him as
President of the United States,

00:45:01.556 --> 00:45:05.892
and to be assassinated.
But the other great broker at

00:45:05.892 --> 00:45:10.318
the '77 Compromise was Tom
Scott, the president of the

00:45:10.318 --> 00:45:14.452
Texas Pacific Railroad.
He'd been one of the great

00:45:14.452 --> 00:45:18.603
American railroad kings for
years and he brokered really

00:45:18.603 --> 00:45:22.075
especially the
economic/financial parts of this

00:45:22.075 --> 00:45:25.409
deal.
Here was the deal.

00:45:25.409 --> 00:45:29.434
Home rule, the Republicans
said, would be returned to

00:45:29.434 --> 00:45:32.530
Louisiana, South Carolina and
Florida.

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:37.841
The Republicans agreed to let
the southern Democrats take over

00:45:37.841 --> 00:45:41.812
those three states,
abandoning their own party

00:45:41.812 --> 00:45:46.675
leaders, abandoning a lot of
black elected officials who are

00:45:46.675 --> 00:45:51.526
still running those governments,
and the Republicans promised

00:45:51.526 --> 00:45:55.387
they would help get Democrats
elected governors of those

00:45:55.387 --> 00:45:57.420
states.
They agreed to remove all final

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.595
federal troops from the South.
And this has always been a big

00:46:00.595 --> 00:46:03.394
symbolic thing;
well, which is exactly what it

00:46:03.394 --> 00:46:07.428
is, it's a big symbolic thing.
There were very few troops left

00:46:07.428 --> 00:46:11.536
anywhere in the South and those
few thousand that were still

00:46:11.536 --> 00:46:14.739
there are located in forts along
the coast.

00:46:14.739 --> 00:46:18.293
And quietly Ulysses Grant
signed a bill in the third week

00:46:18.293 --> 00:46:21.909
of February, just before the
deal at the Wormley Hotel,

00:46:21.909 --> 00:46:30.820
that repealed the law placing
those troops in the South.

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:33.770
One, and possibly two,
cabinet positions in Hayes'

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:36.539
cabinet were promised to
Southern Democrats.

00:46:36.539 --> 00:46:40.262
They particularly promised the
Postmaster Generalship,

00:46:40.262 --> 00:46:42.650
because of its patronage
powers.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:47.474
The Democrats agreed to help
James Garfield become Speaker of

00:46:47.474 --> 00:46:50.470
the House.
It's a deal folks;

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:55.704
quid pro quo, tit for tat.
The Democrats agreed to

00:46:55.704 --> 00:46:58.968
enforce--well,
I can almost not say this

00:46:58.968 --> 00:47:03.989
one--the Democrats agreed to
enforce the Civil War amendments

00:47:03.989 --> 00:47:08.843
and black civil rights--uh
huh--and the Democrats agreed to

00:47:08.843 --> 00:47:14.315
stop their filibuster,
accept the official count,

00:47:14.315 --> 00:47:20.054
and allow Hayes to be
peacefully inaugurated three

00:47:20.054 --> 00:47:25.060
days later or four days later.
On March 3^(rd),

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:27.340
Rutherford B.
Hayes was privately

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:30.358
inaugurated.
No outdoor inauguration on the

00:47:30.358 --> 00:47:33.409
steps of the capitol,
as they are always done.

00:47:33.409 --> 00:47:38.769
They feared violence,
interruptions.

00:47:38.769 --> 00:47:41.320
They didn't know what was going
to happen.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:45.852
He was privately inaugurated,
quietly in the East Room of the

00:47:45.852 --> 00:47:50.430
White House.
Catastrophe had been averted,

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:53.221
but at what a price.
C.

00:47:53.221 --> 00:48:00.596
Vann Woodward once accurately
called this compromise a treaty,

00:48:00.596 --> 00:48:05.847
as much as a compromise.
And if the Compromise of 1850,

00:48:05.847 --> 00:48:08.828
you'll remember,
is so often referred to as an

00:48:08.828 --> 00:48:12.132
armistice,
rather than a compromise,

00:48:12.132 --> 00:48:16.137
this Compromise of 1877 was,
in some ways,

00:48:16.137 --> 00:48:18.833
a treaty.
And, oh by the way,

00:48:18.833 --> 00:48:22.922
Hayes made it very clear,
in private communications,

00:48:22.922 --> 00:48:26.210
what he'd been really saying
publicly,

00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:32.264
and that is that his southern
policy would be essentially--his

00:48:32.264 --> 00:48:38.918
own phrase--a let-alone policy.
The South would be allowed to

00:48:38.918 --> 00:48:42.996
control its own social
institutions,

00:48:42.996 --> 00:48:47.190
its political culture,
its lives.

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:51.884
Even Grant himself had said
that Reconstruction was dead and

00:48:51.884 --> 00:48:56.260
maybe we made mistakes and
shouldn't have even tried.

00:48:56.260 --> 00:49:00.200
Grant himself said to his
cabinet that the Fifteenth

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:03.987
Amendment, he said,
had, quote, "done the Negro no

00:49:03.987 --> 00:49:08.139
good."
Oh Ulysses.

00:49:08.139 --> 00:49:11.904
And right after the
inauguration an editorial in

00:49:11.904 --> 00:49:16.630
Nation Magazine--now a
fuming, reformist magazine;

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:19.679
they want to clean up American
corruption--E.L.

00:49:19.679 --> 00:49:22.661
Godkin, its great editor at the
Nation,

00:49:22.661 --> 00:49:25.909
said--he rejoiced in fact at
this compromise,

00:49:25.909 --> 00:49:30.668
this settling of this
dispute--and he announced,

00:49:30.668 --> 00:49:34.110
his words: "The negro," he
said,

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:38.960
"will disappear now from the
field of national politics.

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:46.889
Henceforth the nation as a
nation will have nothing more to

00:49:46.889 --> 00:49:51.270
do with him."
Now there are many meanings,

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:54.849
legacies, implications of this
compromise.

00:49:54.849 --> 00:49:59.900
There are many long-lasting
implications and legacies of

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:03.665
this compromise,
in this particular end of

00:50:03.665 --> 00:50:07.905
Reconstruction.
And it does seem like a sort of

00:50:07.905 --> 00:50:12.253
dead end, a lights-going-out
kind of moment to all that

00:50:12.253 --> 00:50:16.052
idealism,
or whatever we wish to call it,

00:50:16.052 --> 00:50:20.444
that emerged from the war.
It would leave a person like

00:50:20.444 --> 00:50:23.949
Frederick Douglass in a certain
degree of despair.

00:50:23.949 --> 00:50:27.139
He would begin to make
speeches, and he will the rest

00:50:27.139 --> 00:50:30.820
of his life, about trying to
hold onto an emancipationist,

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:33.605
abolitionist,
memory of the Civil War and

00:50:33.605 --> 00:50:36.831
Reconstruction.
He makes a speech a few years

00:50:36.831 --> 00:50:41.124
later where he's lamenting what
has now been betrayed and lost

00:50:41.124 --> 00:50:43.869
and is eroding out of their
fingers.

00:50:43.869 --> 00:50:49.855
He says Reconstruction is
only--was only perhaps a rope of

00:50:49.855 --> 00:50:52.057
sand.
But, he drew upon,

00:50:52.057 --> 00:50:56.461
at the end of that speech,
he drew upon one of the most

00:50:56.461 --> 00:50:59.559
revolutionary moments in the
Bible,

00:50:59.559 --> 00:51:03.601
to try to keep a certain degree
of hope alive about what had at

00:51:03.601 --> 00:51:07.925
least been started.
He went to the Lazarus story,

00:51:07.925 --> 00:51:14.039
the story of Jesus raising
Lazarus literally from the dead.

00:51:14.039 --> 00:51:17.508
And Douglass said,
"The assumption that the cause

00:51:17.508 --> 00:51:22.059
of the Negro is a dead issue now
is delusion, utter delusion.

00:51:22.059 --> 00:51:25.798
For the moment he may be buried
under the dust and rubbish of

00:51:25.798 --> 00:51:29.099
endless discussion concerning
civil service reform,

00:51:29.099 --> 00:51:33.959
tariff and free trade,
labor and capital,

00:51:33.959 --> 00:51:39.670
but our Lazarus is not dead,
he only sleeps."

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:40.936
See you next week.

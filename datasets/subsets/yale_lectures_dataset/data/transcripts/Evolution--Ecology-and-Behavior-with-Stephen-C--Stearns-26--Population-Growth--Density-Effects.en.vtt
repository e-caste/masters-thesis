00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:02.680
Prof: Okay.
 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.956
Population growth is one of
those things in ecology that is

00:00:06.956 --> 00:00:10.570
good to get kind of an intuitive
feeling about.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.574
And the main thing that you
need to grasp about population

00:00:15.574 --> 00:00:18.910
growth is that it is
multiplicative.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.100
So that if you have a certain
number of things,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.151
and they are making more
things, then the amount you have

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:29.530
next time is proportional to the
number you have this time,

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.210
and it multiplies by itself.
 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.997
It turns out that this kind of
process takes a little bit of

00:00:35.997 --> 00:00:39.000
playing around with to
internalize.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.781
What we'll do today is start by
talking about density

00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:46.344
independent growth,
and that is basically compound

00:00:46.344 --> 00:00:47.290
interest.
 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.670
So compound interest yields
exponential growth,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.670
and if it only went on forever,
we would all be very wealthy.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.259
When I was a professor in
Switzerland,

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:02.990
at one point I suggested to the
Swiss that if they had simply

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.049
invested 100 Swiss francs,
when the university was founded

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:07.787
in 1460,
that they would have an

00:01:07.787 --> 00:01:11.170
endowment greater than the gross
domestic product of the planet,

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.861
at this point;
at only a nice conservative

00:01:14.861 --> 00:01:16.720
Swiss 4% interest.
 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.180
And they would,
but they looked at me knowingly

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.189
and they said,
"Ah, you've forgotten

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.049
Napoleon"
who wiped them out.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.430
&gt; Okay?
 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.510
So the basic point about--let's
see, have I gotten through that?

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.476
Yes--the basic point that I
want you to get about compound

00:01:35.476 --> 00:01:38.547
interest is that it will very
rapidly produce a whole lot of

00:01:38.547 --> 00:01:41.349
stuff,
and that the rate of

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:47.485
multiplication is quite a bit
faster than the arithmetic

00:01:47.485 --> 00:01:51.390
difference in the interest rate.
 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.870
The idea of this whole chart is
to show you that a small

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.670
difference in interest rate can
make a huge difference in the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.430
outcome.
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.641
So I've used basically a bank
account to attract your

00:02:03.641 --> 00:02:07.367
interest, with dollars,
but this will work with

00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:10.848
organisms and populations just
as well.

00:02:10.848 --> 00:02:17.039
The time to double for money
invested at 1% is 70 years;

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:20.568
5% is 14 years;
and 10% is 7 years.

00:02:20.568 --> 00:02:24.470
And the yield after 70 years,
on $100.00, looks like this.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.145
You get $200.00 at 1% interest,
and you get $100,000.00 at 10%

00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:29.990
interest.
 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.960
Okay?
 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.390
So a ten times increase in the
interest rate leads to a 512

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.940
times increase in the outcome.
 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.050
Small differences in interest
rates make big differences in

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.830
outcomes.
 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.175
And as we'll see in a sec,
the interest rate on a

00:02:48.175 --> 00:02:51.060
population is the difference
between the birth and the death

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.500
rate.
 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.440
So you can jiggle the birthrate
a little bit,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.940
you can jiggle the death rate a
little bit,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.120
you'll get a fairly substantial
difference in the growth rate,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.930
the interest rate on the
population,

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.030
and something like this can
happen.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.317
So I want to take you just
through the math of doubling

00:03:06.317 --> 00:03:09.968
time, so you understand that
previous chart.

00:03:09.968 --> 00:03:13.504
And you also need to start
getting familiar with this kind

00:03:13.504 --> 00:03:16.854
of notation, because in
population dynamics and ecology

00:03:16.854 --> 00:03:18.530
it is used pervasively.
 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.345
So B is often used for the
birthrate, D for the death rate,

00:03:22.345 --> 00:03:26.423
and the per capita growth rate
is the birthrate minus the death

00:03:26.423 --> 00:03:26.752
rate.
 

00:03:26.752 --> 00:03:27.408
Okay?
 

00:03:27.408 --> 00:03:29.903
That's birthrate per capita,
death rate per capita,

00:03:29.903 --> 00:03:31.750
and this is growth rate per
capita.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.806
So if you've got N organisms,
then you have the simplest

00:03:34.806 --> 00:03:37.919
differential equation you can
write down practically,

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.377
which is that the rate of
change of the population is

00:03:40.377 --> 00:03:44.050
equal to the growth rate,
times the number of organisms

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.509
that are present.
 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:46.628
Okay?
 

00:03:46.628 --> 00:03:53.280
That means that the slope of
population growth is RN.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.985
So if we have N on the y-axis,
and time on the x-axis,

00:03:57.985 --> 00:04:00.740
it looks something like this.
 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.712
And I put this in to indicate
that for a given change in time

00:04:06.712 --> 00:04:09.491
unit,
the amount of growth you get in

00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:12.879
the population just keeps on
going up and up and up.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:13.300
Okay?
 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.449
It keeps jumping.
 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:19.855
So that the rate of increase in
an exponential process is

00:04:19.855 --> 00:04:24.812
proportional to the growth rate
times the amount of stuff that's

00:04:24.812 --> 00:04:28.523
there;
and that's the slope of the

00:04:28.523 --> 00:04:30.040
relationship.
 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:37.190
So if you write this down and
rearrange it a little bit,

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.833
then you can integrate both
sides, and you get that the

00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:42.672
natural log of the number of
organisms in the population is

00:04:42.672 --> 00:04:45.363
equal to the growth rate times
the amount of time that's

00:04:45.363 --> 00:04:47.420
elapsed since they started
growing,

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.819
plus some constant.
 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:51.639
You can exponentiate both sides.
 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.550
So if you raise E to the log,
you get N.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.600
Okay?
 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.930
And rearrange to get that.
 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.250
So the number of organisms you
have T-time units later,

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.850
is equal to the number that you
started with,

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.550
times E, the base of the
natural logarithms,

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.670
raised to R times T.
 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.499
And, in fact,
that's the basic compound

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:16.509
interest formula as well.
 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:19.033
So you can use that for bank
accounts, just as well as you

00:05:19.033 --> 00:05:20.230
can use it for organisms.
 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.230
So you ask yourself,
"Well how long does it

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.060
take for that population to
double?"

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.607
Where did I come up with that
chart that I showed you on the

00:05:27.607 --> 00:05:28.509
second slide?
 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:33.012
Well the doubling time is the
time that it takes for whatever

00:05:33.012 --> 00:05:36.163
that number is,
divided by what you started

00:05:36.163 --> 00:05:37.740
with, to equal 2.
 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.339
And that will happen when 2 =
e^(RT.

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:45.550
)So the log of 2 is equal to R,
times the doubling time;

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.223
and the doubling time is about
0.69 divided by R,

00:05:49.223 --> 00:05:51.519
because that's the log of 2.
 

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:57.199
So you can multiply that by
100, if you want to use percent,

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.812
and you get the simple rule of
thumb that you can divide 69 by

00:06:00.812 --> 00:06:03.480
the interest rate to get the
doubling time.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.420
Or, as a rule of thumb,
if you're comfortable with

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.324
approximations,
it's a little easier to divide

00:06:10.324 --> 00:06:12.800
72 by the interest rate to get
the doubling time,

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.120
because you can divide 72 by 3
and by 4 and by 8,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.250
and things like that.
 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.240
Okay?
 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.632
Now, I'd like you to get a
little bit familiar with this

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:23.620
sort of thing.
 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.959
And here is a voluntary
homework assignment.

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:31.350
Some of you will enjoy this,
some of you will not.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.060
This can easily be done on a
spreadsheet.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.839
You will have to look up a few
numbers on the Web;

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:38.449
they are readily available.
 

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:41.624
I'd like you to consider an
asexual rabbit population

00:06:41.624 --> 00:06:45.103
consisting only of females,
and each individual reproduces

00:06:45.103 --> 00:06:49.353
at an age of just three months;
gives birth to two offspring

00:06:49.353 --> 00:06:50.110
and dies.
 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.560
I did that, I set it up that
way so that you would have a

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.410
doubling every three months.
 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.060
All of the offspring survive to
reproduce;

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.379
that preserves the doubling.
 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:01.100
You can play around with these
assumptions.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.069
Adult rabbits weigh one kilo.
 

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:05.379
There's no density dependence.
 

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:10.122
I didn't give you this,
but let's say they cover 100

00:07:10.122 --> 00:07:14.029
square centimeters,
something like that;

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:15.649
so about 1/10^(th) of a meter.
 

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:18.115
How long will it take to cover
Science Hill two meters deep in

00:07:18.115 --> 00:07:18.519
rabbits?
 

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:21.379
I think you'll be surprised,
it doesn't take very long.

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:23.997
We can just start with one,
and you're going to have

00:07:23.997 --> 00:07:26.720
Science Hill six feet deep in
rabbits pretty quick.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.350
But you can go farther than
that.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.569
Okay?
 

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:32.180
How long will it take for the
leading edge of the expanding

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.160
ball of fur to exceed the speed
of light,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.910
and what will be the diameter
of the ball at that point,

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.449
measured in earth orbits?
 

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:41.565
I think the answer is roughly
750 years, and you're somewhere

00:07:41.565 --> 00:07:43.759
about the diameter of Jupiter.
 

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:44.810
Okay?
 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.319
About; if I recall correctly.
 

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:48.779
I did this once.
 

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:51.276
And then you can ask how long
will it take to reach the point

00:07:51.276 --> 00:07:53.190
of gravitational collapse into a
black hole?

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.420
Well actually I think it will
happen before the ball of fur

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:57.870
hits the speed of light.
 

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.019
Okay?
 

00:07:59.019 --> 00:08:02.879
Because you're well out beyond
the diameter of the sun.

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:07.137
The point of this ridiculous
example is exponential growth

00:08:07.137 --> 00:08:10.199
rapidly makes a heck of a lot of
stuff.

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:11.199
Okay?
 

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:15.379
I have left unexplained where
the rabbits got their food.

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:16.420
&gt;
 

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.740
Okay?
 

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:25.673
So a small change in growth
rate will make a big difference

00:08:25.673 --> 00:08:28.000
in the outcome.
 

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.250
Remember how to integrate this
differential equation;

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.288
it's pretty straightforward.
 

00:08:36.288 --> 00:08:39.688
Doubling times are a very
convenient way to conceptualize

00:08:39.688 --> 00:08:40.600
growth rates.
 

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.918
So you can divide 69 by the
growth rate to get the doubling

00:08:44.918 --> 00:08:47.684
time;
divide it by the growth rate in

00:08:47.684 --> 00:08:51.379
percent to get the doubling
time, for any process.

00:08:51.379 --> 00:09:01.379
Now in summarizing this,
there was no age structure.

00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:05.763
All of those numbers that we
were counting up represented the

00:09:05.763 --> 00:09:09.782
population as though every
single organism in it had the

00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:13.070
same probability of reproducing
or dying;

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.558
and that's not true.
 

00:09:14.558 --> 00:09:18.432
One of the most obvious things
about populations is that

00:09:18.432 --> 00:09:22.586
organisms of different ages
reproduce at different rates and

00:09:22.586 --> 00:09:24.980
have different risks of dying.
 

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:29.089
So it would be nice to be able
to do population dynamics,

00:09:29.089 --> 00:09:32.464
with a bit more realism,
by sticking in all the

00:09:32.464 --> 00:09:35.399
difference that age structure
makes;

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:41.298
in other words,
doing demography.

00:09:41.298 --> 00:09:43.250
Pre-adult organisms don't give
birth.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.879
Old organisms have high
probabilities of dying.

00:09:45.879 --> 00:09:49.428
Sometimes newborn have very
high probabilities of dying.

00:09:49.428 --> 00:09:52.721
And if we look around the
world, we can see that there are

00:09:52.721 --> 00:09:56.418
roughly speaking three different
kinds of survivorship curves.

00:09:56.418 --> 00:10:00.053
We have age on the x-axis here,
in an arithmetic scale,

00:10:00.053 --> 00:10:04.428
and we have survivorship on the
y-axis, in a logarithmic scale.

00:10:04.428 --> 00:10:08.898
So when you see something like
a type-3 survival curve,

00:10:08.898 --> 00:10:13.366
that is a huge drop in the
number that are present say,

00:10:13.366 --> 00:10:16.428
that are all born here,
at age 0.

00:10:16.428 --> 00:10:20.448
And on this scale there's only
one of them left alive after a

00:10:20.448 --> 00:10:21.990
short period of time.
 

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:26.365
Here you have a straight line,
and if you have a semi-log

00:10:26.365 --> 00:10:28.940
graph,
and you have a straight line,

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.875
what the straight line means is
that a constant proportion are

00:10:32.875 --> 00:10:35.070
dying at a given time interval.
 

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.288
So if you are looking say at
this point,

00:10:38.288 --> 00:10:43.890
on the type-2 survival curve,
you have 1/10^(th) of what you

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.572
had at the start,
and if you look at this point

00:10:47.572 --> 00:10:51.125
on the type-2 survival curve,
you have 1/10^(th) of what you

00:10:51.125 --> 00:10:51.730
had there.
 

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.961
So the straight line is a
constant proportion dying in

00:10:55.961 --> 00:10:57.639
each time interval.
 

00:10:57.639 --> 00:10:59.971
And up here,
life looks pretty good,

00:10:59.971 --> 00:11:03.903
until you get to be a somewhat
aged adult, and then you have

00:11:03.903 --> 00:11:04.970
rapid aging.
 

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.913
So the kinds of things that
have type-1 survival curves are

00:11:07.913 --> 00:11:09.740
humans, elephants and
albatrosses.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.970
Small birds have type-2
survival curves,

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.129
as do hydra.
 

00:11:14.129 --> 00:11:18.720
And oysters and trees have
type-3 survival curves;

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.090
and orchids.
 

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.610
They make hundreds of millions,
or billions of seeds;

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:27.745
most of the seeds die;
and once you have made it to

00:11:27.745 --> 00:11:31.559
adulthood, then your prospects
are pretty good.

00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:33.190
This curve is pretty flat here.
 

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.168
It's almost like this curve is
up here.

00:11:36.168 --> 00:11:41.869
So when we look around the
world, we see that different

00:11:41.869 --> 00:11:46.611
kinds of organisms have a--
well they actually have quite a

00:11:46.611 --> 00:11:49.000
bit of continuous variation in
demography,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.509
but if we want to stick them
into categories,

00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:53.250
we can see some illustrative
extreme cases,

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:57.624
that help us to understand the
diversity of population dynamics

00:11:57.624 --> 00:12:01.076
that organisms encounter,
as well as the diversity of

00:12:01.076 --> 00:12:03.320
selection pressures that they
encounter.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.116
Now in order to analyze that,
we need a bit of demographic

00:12:07.116 --> 00:12:07.850
notation.
 

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:11.457
And I'll step through this,
just pointing out some of the

00:12:11.457 --> 00:12:14.681
key things where people can
stumble when they first

00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:18.399
encounter this notation,
and points that you want to

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:21.482
make sure you keep in your
memory as important

00:12:21.482 --> 00:12:22.580
distinctions.
 

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.075
The first one is the
distinction between age and

00:12:26.075 --> 00:12:29.846
time,
and that is the distinction

00:12:29.846 --> 00:12:36.200
between being 62-years-old and
21-years-old in 2009,

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:41.039
and what's happened over the
last 20 years.

00:12:41.039 --> 00:12:42.149
Okay?
 

00:12:42.149 --> 00:12:45.684
So you can have people of
different ages at the same time,

00:12:45.684 --> 00:12:49.470
and you can have people of the
same age at different times.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:56.769
So X keeps track of age and T
keeps track of time.

00:12:56.769 --> 00:13:01.447
Then there are two different
kinds of ways of thinking about

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:02.320
survival.
 

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.583
One is the probability of
surviving from now to next year,

00:13:05.583 --> 00:13:08.791
or now to the next time unit,
however you choose to scale

00:13:08.791 --> 00:13:09.879
your time unit.
 

00:13:09.879 --> 00:13:13.490
And the other is the
probability of surviving from

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.519
birth until now,
which would be the probability

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:18.692
here,
LX, probability of surviving

00:13:18.692 --> 00:13:21.320
from birth to beginning of age
class X,

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.480
whatever X is.
 

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:28.480
And that is just the product of
all of the PXs up to that point.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.440
So it's the product of
surviving from birth to age 1;

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.440
age 1 to age 2;
age 2 to age 3;

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.980
etcetera, up to now.
 

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.753
Then once you get to be X years
old, MX is the symbol that keeps

00:13:41.753 --> 00:13:45.086
track of how many babies a
female would have,

00:13:45.086 --> 00:13:47.360
that survived to that age.
 

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.000
Alpha is age at maturity;
Omega is age at last

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:51.700
reproduction.
 

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.428
And age at maturity doesn't
mean, in demography,

00:13:56.428 --> 00:14:00.219
age at acquisition of secondary
sexual characteristics or

00:14:00.219 --> 00:14:03.129
acquisition of the ability to
reproduce,

00:14:03.129 --> 00:14:07.220
it means the actual age at
which a baby arrives;

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.240
okay, when offspring are born.
 

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.230
Little-r is the population
growth rate.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:15.422
And here we have a collection
of three different growth rates,

00:14:15.422 --> 00:14:17.620
and they mean somewhat
different things.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.827
And if you're thinking about
zero population growth,

00:14:20.827 --> 00:14:24.476
the value of these things is
going to be different for zero

00:14:24.476 --> 00:14:25.860
population growth.
 

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.917
r, as I mentioned before,
is B minus D,

00:14:28.917 --> 00:14:33.423
birthrate minus death rate,
and it's an instantaneous per

00:14:33.423 --> 00:14:36.159
capita population growth rate.
 

00:14:36.159 --> 00:14:36.840
Okay?
 

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.360
So it is comparable say to the
interest rate that your bank

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.490
tells you that you're getting on
your savings,

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.700
or that you're being charged on
your credit card.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:48.960
Big Ro is the lifetime
expectation of female offspring.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.741
In demography we tend to keep
track only of females,

00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:53.980
because they are the
rate-limiting sex.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.605
They are normally,
as you remember from sexual

00:14:56.605 --> 00:14:59.657
selection lectures,
the limiting resource,

00:14:59.657 --> 00:15:04.235
and it is their reproductive
rate that actually determines

00:15:04.235 --> 00:15:07.928
the rate at which the population
will grow.

00:15:07.928 --> 00:15:12.474
So this is the rate of growth
per generation,

00:15:12.474 --> 00:15:15.894
and it's Ro;
and Lambda, which is e^(r) is

00:15:15.894 --> 00:15:19.230
the multiplicative rate of
growth per time unit.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:24.193
And you'll see how these
numbers compare as we go through

00:15:24.193 --> 00:15:25.788
the next slides.
 

00:15:25.788 --> 00:15:29.379
These things are calculated on
the basis of life tables.

00:15:29.379 --> 00:15:32.405
So a life table is an
accounting tool,

00:15:32.405 --> 00:15:37.149
and frankly life tables are a
bit like natural selection in

00:15:37.149 --> 00:15:40.268
the following way;
they actually do imply a kind

00:15:40.268 --> 00:15:42.631
of natural selection,
but that's not the point I want

00:15:42.631 --> 00:15:43.360
to emphasize.
 

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.100
They are deceptively simple.
 

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.854
Life tables are basically a
rather boring kind of accounting

00:15:50.854 --> 00:15:54.399
of births and deaths,
but they have very deep

00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:55.769
implications.
 

00:15:55.769 --> 00:15:59.998
Just as natural selection is
based on four very simple

00:15:59.998 --> 00:16:03.028
conditions that you can write
down,

00:16:03.028 --> 00:16:06.139
but nevertheless creates all of
the complexity of brains and

00:16:06.139 --> 00:16:10.551
livers and everything else,
life tables have that kind of

00:16:10.551 --> 00:16:12.700
deceptive simplicity.
 

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.164
So LX--we're going to make a
simple one--LX is the

00:16:16.164 --> 00:16:19.490
probability of surviving from
birth to age X.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.727
BX or MX is the number of
female offspring,

00:16:22.727 --> 00:16:24.808
born to females of age X.
 

00:16:24.808 --> 00:16:30.121
And LXMX is the probability
both of surviving to X and of

00:16:30.121 --> 00:16:32.210
having MX offspring.
 

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.043
So the sum, LXMX,
over all ages X,

00:16:35.043 --> 00:16:39.852
is the expected number of
female offspring per female per

00:16:39.852 --> 00:16:42.168
lifetime;
that's R0.

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:45.024
So you can just put an equals
sign in here,

00:16:45.024 --> 00:16:45.840
that's R0.
 

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.879
Okay?
 

00:16:46.879 --> 00:16:49.197
So that's a measure of
population growth,

00:16:49.197 --> 00:16:50.298
an important one.
 

00:16:50.298 --> 00:16:56.134
And if we take a simple example
where we have this survival rate

00:16:56.134 --> 00:17:00.464
from one year to the next--
and I've set this equal to 0,

00:17:00.464 --> 00:17:02.450
so that nobody makes it to age
3--

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:05.949
starting at birth
everybody--we're keeping track

00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:09.730
of things that get born--
so everybody has a probability

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:12.287
of 1 of being born--
because those are the only ones

00:17:12.287 --> 00:17:16.305
we're counting--
and 50% of making it to age 1,

00:17:16.305 --> 00:17:19.710
and 25% of making it to age 2.
 

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:25.220
Just P0 times P1 gives us .25
here.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.480
This is the birthrate.
 

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.338
Okay?
 

00:17:27.338 --> 00:17:31.476
So these organisms mature at
age 1 and they get better at

00:17:31.476 --> 00:17:35.029
reproducing;
perhaps they continue to grow

00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:39.288
and they have 2.4 offspring per
female at age 2.

00:17:39.288 --> 00:17:42.671
And these are their
contributions to fitness:

00:17:42.671 --> 00:17:45.359
.5 here;
so half of them make it to age

00:17:45.359 --> 00:17:48.689
1 and have 1 offspring,
and a quarter of them make it

00:17:48.689 --> 00:17:50.930
to age 2 and have 2.4 offspring.
 

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:54.895
We multiply those numbers
together, sum them up,

00:17:54.895 --> 00:17:56.500
we get R0 = 1.10.
 

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.279
The important thing about R0 is
that it's greater than 1.

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:02.789
This population is growing.
 

00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:05.838
Okay?
 

00:18:05.838 --> 00:18:10.218
Now if we want to look ahead
and ask what's going to be the

00:18:10.218 --> 00:18:12.858
age distribution in future
years?

00:18:12.858 --> 00:18:15.490
If you have a life table for
humans--

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.926
you might be interested in
knowing will there be enough

00:18:18.926 --> 00:18:20.755
people around,
who are young,

00:18:20.755 --> 00:18:23.470
to pay for your Social Security
when you're old?--

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:26.088
you can use this procedure to
do so,

00:18:26.088 --> 00:18:27.960
and that's what demographers do
with it.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.058
Okay?
 

00:18:29.058 --> 00:18:32.588
So the number of newborn is the
sum across age classes;

00:18:32.588 --> 00:18:35.380
so the number of females alive
that year, times their expected

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:35.930
fecundity.
 

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:36.858
That's pretty straightforward.
 

00:18:36.858 --> 00:18:39.637
Just take the number of
females, take the average number

00:18:39.637 --> 00:18:42.012
of babies they'll have,
and that's the number of

00:18:42.012 --> 00:18:42.618
newborn.
 

00:18:42.618 --> 00:18:46.253
The number alive in any older
age class is the number that

00:18:46.253 --> 00:18:50.078
were alive in the younger age
class in the previous year,

00:18:50.078 --> 00:18:52.009
times the probability they
survived.

00:18:52.009 --> 00:18:53.838
That's pretty straightforward.
 

00:18:53.838 --> 00:18:56.450
This is the deceptive
simplicity of life tables;

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.200
just straightforward accounting.
 

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.769
So here we have again a
….

00:19:01.769 --> 00:19:04.269
this is the same life table we
had before.

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:08.410
Now I've put in 10 organisms in
each of the three age classes.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.131
Okay, we have 10 newborn,
10 1-year-olds,

00:19:11.131 --> 00:19:12.558
and 10 2-year-olds.
 

00:19:12.558 --> 00:19:15.640
And this is how the population
will develop.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:20.348
Half of these survive,
half of these survive.

00:19:20.348 --> 00:19:23.778
Half of these survive,
half of these survive.

00:19:23.778 --> 00:19:26.160
I've rounded these off to get
whole organisms.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.490
So that's the survival part of
it.

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:29.630
How about the births?
 

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:40.410
Well these 10 here are going to
be giving birth to 5 offspring,

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:44.759
and these 10 here are going to
be giving birth--

00:19:44.759 --> 00:19:47.759
excuse me, these 10 here are
going to be giving,

00:19:47.759 --> 00:19:50.119
each of these are going to be
giving birth to 1 offspring.

00:19:50.119 --> 00:19:51.108
So that's 10.
 

00:19:51.108 --> 00:19:53.130
And these 10 here give birth to
2.4.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.980
That adds up to 34.
 

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.588
Okay?
 

00:19:56.588 --> 00:19:59.605
This times this,
plus this times this,

00:19:59.605 --> 00:20:00.420
is that.
 

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:07.876
Five offspring come from this
group and 12 offspring come from

00:20:07.876 --> 00:20:11.299
this group, and we get 17.
 

00:20:11.299 --> 00:20:12.420
Okay?
 

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.960
And that just keeps going.
 

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.213
So in each generation you can
carry that out as a matrix

00:20:17.213 --> 00:20:18.220
transformation.
 

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.259
It's called the Leslie matrix.
 

00:20:20.259 --> 00:20:23.199
You can use all of the
properties of linear algebra to

00:20:23.199 --> 00:20:25.028
project things into the future.
 

00:20:25.028 --> 00:20:29.083
You can use mathematics
packages, like MatLab or

00:20:29.083 --> 00:20:32.531
Mathematica, and even Excel
spreadsheets,

00:20:32.531 --> 00:20:35.118
to carry this process out.
 

00:20:35.118 --> 00:20:40.381
Now if you study that process,
it turns out these are its

00:20:40.381 --> 00:20:43.200
critical take-home messages.
 

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.781
Any such process,
where you have a constant rate

00:20:46.781 --> 00:20:50.223
of birth and death,
will produce a population that

00:20:50.223 --> 00:20:52.871
attains a stable age
distribution in which the

00:20:52.871 --> 00:20:56.400
proportion of individuals in
each class remains constant.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.602
So that means like the ratio of
five-year-olds to ten-year-olds

00:21:00.602 --> 00:21:01.890
remains constant.
 

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:05.500
And it will get there fairly
quickly;

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.140
not immediately but fairly
quickly.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.778
When it gets into stable age
distribution,

00:21:11.778 --> 00:21:14.997
both the entire population and
each age class in it are growing

00:21:14.997 --> 00:21:16.970
exponentially at the constant
rate,

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:21.038
r, and that r has exactly the
same meaning as it did when we

00:21:21.038 --> 00:21:25.246
were back dealing with a simple
population in just that simple

00:21:25.246 --> 00:21:27.039
differential equation.
 

00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:29.410
Okay, so that's this state.
 

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:32.384
The growth rate of the
age-structured population is the

00:21:32.384 --> 00:21:35.799
same as the growth rate of a
density independent population.

00:21:35.799 --> 00:21:37.630
So, let's do an example.
 

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:42.094
Here's a life table that
actually is roughly that of a

00:21:42.094 --> 00:21:43.190
small bird.
 

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.440
So the guys that fly into my
bird feeder in Hamden,

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.848
the house sparrows,
the chickadees and so forth,

00:21:49.848 --> 00:21:53.460
they could have a life table
that looks something like this.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.848
They don't live very long.
 

00:21:54.848 --> 00:21:59.789
So here are the probabilities
of surviving to age 1,2 and 3.

00:21:59.789 --> 00:22:01.598
Here are the birthrates.
 

00:22:01.598 --> 00:22:04.509
I've set them constant for the
three age classes.

00:22:04.509 --> 00:22:05.880
Here's LXMX.
 

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.339
This is our population growth
rate.

00:22:08.339 --> 00:22:10.548
It's 1.2 per generation.
 

00:22:10.548 --> 00:22:15.310
So just based on this,
we can make several interesting

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.480
statements.
 

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.700
Their population is growing.
 

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.288
Okay?
 

00:22:20.288 --> 00:22:23.420
And that's because 1.2 is
greater than 1.0.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:29.538
And it is multiplying actually
1.2 times per generation;

00:22:29.538 --> 00:22:32.288
not per year,
but per generation.

00:22:32.288 --> 00:22:37.450
We can calculate the generation
time with this formula.

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:42.410
So we just divide sum of LXMX
times X, by R0.

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:45.500
That turns out to be 1.67 years.
 

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.207
And the meaning in words of
generation time,

00:22:48.207 --> 00:22:52.047
in demography--it's a technical
meaning--is the average age of

00:22:52.047 --> 00:22:53.808
the mother of a newborn.
 

00:22:53.808 --> 00:22:59.269
So that's the average age of
the mother of a newborn.

00:22:59.269 --> 00:23:01.804
The little-r,
can be estimated--and this is

00:23:01.804 --> 00:23:04.821
an estimate, it's not
precise--by taking the log of

00:23:04.821 --> 00:23:07.779
big-R and dividing it by the
generation time;

00:23:07.779 --> 00:23:09.608
and that's about 0.11.
 

00:23:09.608 --> 00:23:13.826
So this population is growing
at a compound interest rate of

00:23:13.826 --> 00:23:16.821
about 11% per year,
and we can use that to go back

00:23:16.821 --> 00:23:19.430
and use our doubling time
calculations to figure out,

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.088
oh, it's doubling about every
6.3 years.

00:23:22.088 --> 00:23:25.566
If I'm putting the bird seed
out there in Hamden,

00:23:25.566 --> 00:23:28.970
I had better be ready for large
expenditures.

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:34.414
And I'd like you to note that
R0 is calculated on a different

00:23:34.414 --> 00:23:38.588
time period, generation time,
than little-r.

00:23:38.588 --> 00:23:41.933
So when big-R0 is equal to 1,
little-r is equal to 0,

00:23:41.933 --> 00:23:44.765
and the population is then--the
word is used,

00:23:44.765 --> 00:23:46.730
stationary;
it's just replacing itself.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:49.930
A stationary population is
replacing itself,

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:53.800
but a population with age
structure, that is growing,

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.630
can be in stable age
distribution.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:24:00.717
Stable age distribution refers
to the ratios between the age

00:24:00.717 --> 00:24:03.299
classes;
stationary refers to whether or

00:24:03.299 --> 00:24:06.777
not it's just replacing itself,
or whether it's growing or

00:24:06.777 --> 00:24:07.569
declining.
 

00:24:07.569 --> 00:24:08.720
Okay?
 

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.895
So that's a rough sketch of
simple demography,

00:24:12.895 --> 00:24:18.094
and an introduction to the
different ways that ecologists

00:24:18.094 --> 00:24:22.548
and demographers conceptualize
growth rates.

00:24:22.548 --> 00:24:26.558
Now I want to criticize--not
really criticize,

00:24:26.558 --> 00:24:31.368
but comment on one of the basic
assumptions of this.

00:24:31.368 --> 00:24:35.160
The first way that you can
complicate simple dynamics is by

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.375
putting in age structure,
but the second way you can

00:24:38.375 --> 00:24:40.509
complicate it is by putting in
density.

00:24:40.509 --> 00:24:50.058
Here is growth of a bird that
was introduced to Great Britain,

00:24:50.058 --> 00:24:54.307
the turtledove,
and it took off from a very

00:24:54.307 --> 00:24:59.390
small population,
and it grew exponentially.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:03.335
Remember, if you have a
straight line on a semi-log

00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:07.130
plot--so y-axis here;
numbers is on a log scale;

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:09.500
x-axis is on an arithmetic
scale.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.196
So this is a straight line,
and it's going like

00:25:12.196 --> 00:25:14.660
gangbusters, it's growing
exponentially.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:18.536
And about every,
let's see, one,

00:25:18.536 --> 00:25:26.288
two, three--it's increasing in
size about ten times every three

00:25:26.288 --> 00:25:27.538
years.
 

00:25:27.538 --> 00:25:30.114
So these doves are really
pumping out the babies and

00:25:30.114 --> 00:25:31.730
they're surviving pretty well.
 

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:34.880
But something happens up here.
 

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.479
This is a real point here;
this is a real point here,

00:25:38.479 --> 00:25:40.588
and it starts to level off.
 

00:25:40.588 --> 00:25:47.107
So the question is,
what does increasing population

00:25:47.107 --> 00:25:52.846
density do to the demography,
the birth probabilities,

00:25:52.846 --> 00:25:55.720
and the death probabilities of
individuals?

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.910
Can we understand that in terms
of the kinds of concepts we're

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:02.038
already covered this morning?
 

00:26:02.038 --> 00:26:04.338
Well you've seen this plot
before.

00:26:04.338 --> 00:26:08.497
So as density--we can think of
this being a high density

00:26:08.497 --> 00:26:12.578
population and this being a low
density population,

00:26:12.578 --> 00:26:15.190
with rapid growth,
rapid individual growth--

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:17.778
now not population growth,
but rapid individual growth,

00:26:17.778 --> 00:26:21.108
increase of size with age at
low density,

00:26:21.108 --> 00:26:24.048
and slow individual growth at
high density.

00:26:24.048 --> 00:26:27.530
And I think by now you're
familiar with the idea that

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:31.278
there is a reaction norm for age
and size at maturity.

00:26:31.278 --> 00:26:34.521
And if you move from low
density to high density,

00:26:34.521 --> 00:26:37.020
basically what happens,
in many cases,

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:39.587
is you get organisms that
mature later,

00:26:39.587 --> 00:26:41.210
at a smaller size.
 

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:44.596
So one of the very basic
characteristics that determines

00:26:44.596 --> 00:26:47.000
population growth is age at
maturity.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.660
That's basically the interval
over which the compound interest

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.118
is being calculated,
and that's responding

00:26:53.118 --> 00:26:54.740
plastically to density.
 

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.269
So as the density of the
population goes up,

00:26:57.269 --> 00:27:00.269
the organisms delay maturity,
they mature later--

00:27:00.269 --> 00:27:05.869
here, rather than here--and
they mature smaller--

00:27:05.869 --> 00:27:08.318
here, rather than here.
 

00:27:08.318 --> 00:27:11.392
So they are less capable of
making babies,

00:27:11.392 --> 00:27:15.740
and they're doing so later in
life and at a slower rate.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:19.419
The other dramatic thing that
happens with density is that

00:27:19.419 --> 00:27:20.838
mortality increases.
 

00:27:20.838 --> 00:27:24.900
Here is an experiment that was
done with trout.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:29.250
This is a log scale here and a
log scale here,

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:32.172
and the flat line here
basically indicates that growth

00:27:32.172 --> 00:27:34.522
has stopped,
or that density has stopped

00:27:34.522 --> 00:27:35.200
increasing.
 

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:39.730
And if you just take an
experimental stream bed,

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:44.538
and you seed it with baby
trout, and you do that a number

00:27:44.538 --> 00:27:47.278
of times,
at different initial densities

00:27:47.278 --> 00:27:49.548
per square meter--
okay?

00:27:49.548 --> 00:27:55.430
So this would be 10 raised to
the 2.5 per square meter.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:58.315
So this is about 300 trout per
square meter,

00:27:58.315 --> 00:28:01.670
and this is 10 trout per square
meter over here.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:04.848
So in arithmetic terms,
we're going from 10 per square

00:28:04.848 --> 00:28:06.371
meter,
up to about 300,

00:28:06.371 --> 00:28:10.372
and what we get out,
at the end of the experiment,

00:28:10.372 --> 00:28:13.298
is roughly 10 per square meter.
 

00:28:13.298 --> 00:28:16.952
So there's an enormous amount
of mortality which is going on,

00:28:16.952 --> 00:28:18.108
over on this end.
 

00:28:18.108 --> 00:28:22.128
And you can think of that as
sort of runt of the litter kinds

00:28:22.128 --> 00:28:24.633
of things,
baby pigs competing in a

00:28:24.633 --> 00:28:28.239
litter, or you can think of it
simply as interspecific

00:28:28.239 --> 00:28:29.259
competition.
 

00:28:29.259 --> 00:28:32.575
These trout are competing for
food, and the ones that are best

00:28:32.575 --> 00:28:35.509
at finding it are going to be
the ones that survive.

00:28:35.509 --> 00:28:39.538
There've been lots of
experiments done with plants.

00:28:39.538 --> 00:28:44.486
Here again we have a log scale
on this axis and a log scale on

00:28:44.486 --> 00:28:48.782
this axis, and this is the
density of surviving plants

00:28:48.782 --> 00:28:49.189
here.
 

00:28:49.189 --> 00:28:50.000
Okay?
 

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.380
So this is the number per
square meter.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.970
On this axis we have the number
that were planted,

00:28:55.970 --> 00:29:00.615
and that's going to range
from--down here we're probably

00:29:00.615 --> 00:29:05.021
at about 12 or 15,
up to about 1000 per square

00:29:05.021 --> 00:29:07.068
meter, were planted.
 

00:29:07.068 --> 00:29:11.219
And these different lines here
are showing you what the density

00:29:11.219 --> 00:29:13.828
of plants is 22 days after
planting,

00:29:13.828 --> 00:29:17.230
39 days after planting,
61 days after planting,

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:19.180
and 93 days after planting.
 

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:25.153
And this is the demographic
process that basically leads to

00:29:25.153 --> 00:29:27.730
constant final biomass.
 

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:30.640
So if you go on,
all the way through to harvest,

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:35.327
you're going to end up with
about 100 plants per square

00:29:35.327 --> 00:29:37.702
meter,
and the--by the way,

00:29:37.702 --> 00:29:42.078
the way that plants regulate
their individual growth,

00:29:42.078 --> 00:29:47.093
you essentially get the same
amount of leaf area or root area

00:29:47.093 --> 00:29:50.519
covering a square centimeter of
ground.

00:29:50.519 --> 00:29:54.481
So if you plant a lot,
you're going to end up with

00:29:54.481 --> 00:29:57.973
fewer leaves and less roots,
and you're going to get smaller

00:29:57.973 --> 00:30:00.196
plants,
but the total amount of plant

00:30:00.196 --> 00:30:04.538
material sitting on that square
meter will be roughly constant,

00:30:04.538 --> 00:30:07.430
irrespective of initial
planting density,

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:11.509
if you just let this process go
on long enough.

00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:14.210
The other thing that happens is
that as density goes up,

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:18.865
fecundity goes down,
and that's because as density

00:30:18.865 --> 00:30:21.586
goes up,
competition for food increases,

00:30:21.586 --> 00:30:23.858
individuals are not getting fed
as much,

00:30:23.858 --> 00:30:27.598
and they are therefore less
able to make babies.

00:30:27.598 --> 00:30:31.202
In this panel over here,
we see basically natural

00:30:31.202 --> 00:30:34.880
variation in song sparrows on
Mandarte Island,

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:39.000
which is a small island off the
coast of Vancouver Island;

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.430
it's not too far from Victoria.
 

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:44.365
If you take the ferry from
Vancouver, over to Victoria,

00:30:44.365 --> 00:30:48.230
you go within about a kilometer
of Mandarte Island.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:49.108
Okay?
 

00:30:49.108 --> 00:30:55.605
And this is the number of young
that females were able to

00:30:55.605 --> 00:30:56.650
fledge.
 

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:58.150
These are the years.
 

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:00.558
So that's 1980,1981, 1982.
 

00:31:00.558 --> 00:31:03.450
This is the number of breeding
females on the island.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:06.690
And what you see is that as the
number of breeding females

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:09.759
increases, the number they are
able to fledge starts to

00:31:09.759 --> 00:31:10.500
decrease.
 

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:16.717
And in the year 1985 they did
an experiment where they added

00:31:16.717 --> 00:31:19.392
food--
so they wanted to see whether

00:31:19.392 --> 00:31:22.298
this natural variation could be
manipulated,

00:31:22.298 --> 00:31:24.019
just by putting food out on the
island--

00:31:24.019 --> 00:31:27.573
and those who were fed were
able to rear nearly four

00:31:27.573 --> 00:31:30.036
offspring;
and at high density,

00:31:30.036 --> 00:31:33.615
up here, in 1985,
those who were not fed were

00:31:33.615 --> 00:31:35.650
only able to rear one.
 

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:38.685
So there was a difference per
female of nearly three

00:31:38.685 --> 00:31:40.335
offspring,
and that was what the

00:31:40.335 --> 00:31:41.960
population density was doing to
them,

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.567
and the manipulation experiment
showed that it was the density

00:31:45.567 --> 00:31:47.578
and that food was the mechanism.
 

00:31:47.578 --> 00:31:51.400
If you look at a dune plant in
the Netherlands--

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.940
this is Vulpia,
which is a grass,

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.987
and this is growing near
Leiden, on the dunes on the

00:31:57.987 --> 00:31:59.838
North Sea in the Netherlands.
 

00:31:59.838 --> 00:32:03.198
The number of seeds per plant,
number of flowing plants per

00:32:03.198 --> 00:32:06.490
quarter square meter;
the number goes down.

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:10.348
So the more crowded they get,
the fewer seeds they can make.

00:32:10.348 --> 00:32:13.526
So this is variation that's
really going on in Nature,

00:32:13.526 --> 00:32:16.702
and it shows you that the
effects of density are quite

00:32:16.702 --> 00:32:18.740
real, they're pretty dramatic.
 

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.180
These effects can be combined.
 

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:26.844
So if we want to combine number
of births and numbers dying,

00:32:26.844 --> 00:32:31.932
this would be density,
over here, going from 0 up to a

00:32:31.932 --> 00:32:33.180
number K.
 

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:38.838
The numbers dying increase as
we go across this,

00:32:38.838 --> 00:32:42.348
and the numbers being born
decrease,

00:32:42.348 --> 00:32:47.247
and at some intermediate point
you have the greatest difference

00:32:47.247 --> 00:32:50.170
between the births and the
deaths,

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:53.589
and that difference between
births and deaths is the

00:32:53.589 --> 00:32:54.529
recruitment.
 

00:32:54.529 --> 00:32:55.519
Okay?
 

00:32:55.519 --> 00:33:02.537
So the recruitment inferred
from this graph looks like this,

00:33:02.537 --> 00:33:08.603
and at 0--you get zero
recruitment when you hit this

00:33:08.603 --> 00:33:11.605
number K;
and that number K is called

00:33:11.605 --> 00:33:12.630
carrying capacity.
 

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:15.144
So the population,
under density-dependent

00:33:15.144 --> 00:33:18.643
regulation, will increase until
it hits carrying capacity,

00:33:18.643 --> 00:33:20.730
and then it will stop growing.
 

00:33:23.838 --> 00:33:29.936
Now as density is taking its
effect, the size distribution of

00:33:29.936 --> 00:33:34.509
individuals in the population
often shifts.

00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:39.306
So what I'm basically doing
here is I'm showing you all the

00:33:39.306 --> 00:33:43.772
things that density does to the
individual lives of the

00:33:43.772 --> 00:33:48.568
organisms that are experiencing
this density increase.

00:33:48.568 --> 00:33:54.098
And this is a very interesting
one, because basically what's

00:33:54.098 --> 00:33:58.410
going on here--and this is
measured in flax.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:03.121
If you start at low,
medium or high density,

00:34:03.121 --> 00:34:09.476
two weeks after emergence the
distribution of body sizes in

00:34:09.476 --> 00:34:13.530
the population is pretty
similar;

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:15.679
it's a nice bell-shaped curve.
 

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:19.929
This is now six weeks from
emergence.

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:23.789
So a bunch of other replicates
have now been gathered.

00:34:23.789 --> 00:34:26.675
And you can look at plant
weight here, you can see that

00:34:26.675 --> 00:34:28.920
they're bigger,
the scales are changing.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.048
But you'll notice that at the
medium and at the high-density

00:34:32.048 --> 00:34:35.018
treatments you're starting to
get quite a bit of skew.

00:34:35.018 --> 00:34:38.186
You're starting to get a few
big ones and lots of little

00:34:38.186 --> 00:34:39.925
ones;
that's what this kind of

00:34:39.925 --> 00:34:42.710
histogram means here,
lots of little ones and a few

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:43.380
big ones.
 

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:47.800
And at the final harvest,
which is probably about 12

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.614
weeks after planting,
you're starting to get a little

00:34:51.614 --> 00:34:54.018
bit of skew at the low density
treatment,

00:34:54.018 --> 00:34:58.230
but at the medium and high
density treatments,

00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:59.679
you've got a lot of skew.
 

00:34:59.679 --> 00:35:01.320
Okay?
 

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.788
Now this is something that was
going on, by the way,

00:35:04.788 --> 00:35:08.065
in those trout experiments;
you were getting a few big ones

00:35:08.065 --> 00:35:09.159
and a lot of little ones.
 

00:35:09.159 --> 00:35:12.585
In the plants living in the
Dutch dunes, you were getting a

00:35:12.585 --> 00:35:14.949
few big ones and a lot of little
ones.

00:35:14.949 --> 00:35:18.708
It's a pretty widespread
pattern that happens as density

00:35:18.708 --> 00:35:19.530
increases.
 

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:22.130
There's going to be
intra-specific competition.

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:24.590
Some individuals are going to
be better at it than others.

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:25.699
Okay?
 

00:35:25.699 --> 00:35:29.768
And it's going to result in
these kinds of size and growth

00:35:29.768 --> 00:35:30.909
distributions.
 

00:35:30.909 --> 00:35:35.905
So the more competition there
is, the greater the skew will be

00:35:35.905 --> 00:35:39.920
between lots of little ones and
a few big ones.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:46.489
So that means that competition
is producing an asymmetry,

00:35:46.489 --> 00:35:50.675
and this asymmetry,
where you have a really skewed

00:35:50.675 --> 00:35:54.123
size distribution,
just basically means that a few

00:35:54.123 --> 00:35:57.215
individuals are going to be
doing most of the surviving and

00:35:57.215 --> 00:35:59.393
reproducing,
and a lot of individuals are

00:35:59.393 --> 00:36:01.190
going to be doing most of the
dying,

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:05.739
and not reproducing.
 

00:36:05.739 --> 00:36:08.880
In many cases the number of
large individuals is relatively

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.023
constant, while the number of
small individuals varies much

00:36:12.023 --> 00:36:12.889
more widely.
 

00:36:12.889 --> 00:36:15.420
That's the law of constant
final yield.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.440
Okay?
 

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:21.626
Or the flat line that we saw
with the trout that were planted

00:36:21.626 --> 00:36:24.739
at- were seeded into the
streams,

00:36:24.739 --> 00:36:27.369
at many different densities,
but you always ended up with

00:36:27.369 --> 00:36:28.590
roughly the same number.
 

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:32.815
That was probably the number of
the large surviving competitive

00:36:32.815 --> 00:36:36.634
individuals, and the small
individuals are being squeezed

00:36:36.634 --> 00:36:37.179
out.
 

00:36:37.179 --> 00:36:40.829
That has an evolutionary
consequence.

00:36:40.829 --> 00:36:44.847
This is a direct tie now
between population dynamics and

00:36:44.847 --> 00:36:46.309
natural selection.
 

00:36:46.309 --> 00:36:50.518
Not all those who are born will
survive to reproduce;

00:36:50.518 --> 00:36:52.789
some are starving or are being
crowded out.

00:36:52.789 --> 00:36:56.936
And not all who survive to
reproduce are large and in good

00:36:56.936 --> 00:36:57.518
shape.
 

00:36:57.518 --> 00:37:01.023
Many of them,
in fact, are in poor condition

00:37:01.023 --> 00:37:03.059
and have few offspring.
 

00:37:03.059 --> 00:37:06.865
So intra-specific competition
produces great variation in

00:37:06.865 --> 00:37:10.469
capacity to reproduce and in
reproductive success,

00:37:10.469 --> 00:37:15.739
and that means that wherever
you have reproductive and

00:37:15.739 --> 00:37:18.932
mortality skew,
that's being produced by

00:37:18.932 --> 00:37:21.847
intra-specific competition,
you are generating the

00:37:21.847 --> 00:37:23.730
conditions for natural
selection.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:27.516
It's as though there's an
internal process in ecology that

00:37:27.516 --> 00:37:31.170
just hands you the conditions
for natural selection on a

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:32.300
dinner plate.
 

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:38.978
Now I previously mentioned the
case of the collapse of the

00:37:38.978 --> 00:37:42.730
sardine fishery in California.
 

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:46.268
And the sardine fishery,
which collapsed in California

00:37:46.268 --> 00:37:50.146
between about 1948 and 1955--
and still hasn't come back by

00:37:50.146 --> 00:37:52.132
the way--
it collapsed because of

00:37:52.132 --> 00:37:55.744
conditions that were affecting
juvenile sardines that were out

00:37:55.744 --> 00:37:57.760
in the plankton in the Pacific.
 

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:01.121
It did not collapse because of
a fishery that was operating on

00:38:01.121 --> 00:38:03.849
the adult sardines;
and this is pretty well

00:38:03.849 --> 00:38:05.010
established now.
 

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:10.148
When fewer and fewer juveniles
were being recruited into the

00:38:10.148 --> 00:38:13.853
adult population,
the individual adults were

00:38:13.853 --> 00:38:17.856
essentially experiencing a
release from intra-specific

00:38:17.856 --> 00:38:18.989
competition.
 

00:38:18.989 --> 00:38:24.389
So their response was to grow
faster;

00:38:24.389 --> 00:38:26.570
they could eat more,
they could grow faster and they

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:27.639
could make more babies.
 

00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:32.498
And just as the last boats in
that fleet were pulling in and

00:38:32.498 --> 00:38:37.027
deciding to stop fishing,
they were catching a very few,

00:38:37.027 --> 00:38:40.322
very big sardines;
the sardines were about a meter

00:38:40.322 --> 00:38:40.610
long.
 

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:44.563
They had gone from that big to
that big, and that was what the

00:38:44.563 --> 00:38:48.389
release from intra-specific
competition had done to them.

00:38:48.389 --> 00:38:51.193
And if they were able to
re-establish the fishery and

00:38:51.193 --> 00:38:54.161
have lots of babies and have the
babies recruit into the

00:38:54.161 --> 00:38:56.186
population properly,
and grow up,

00:38:56.186 --> 00:38:58.389
the size would shrink right
back down.

00:38:58.389 --> 00:39:03.153
That would be the impact of
density dependent population

00:39:03.153 --> 00:39:07.139
growth on the California sardine
population.

00:39:07.139 --> 00:39:15.670
Okay, populations are held in
check by lots of things.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:18.489
They're not just held in check
by food.

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:22.664
They are held in check by
breeding sites,

00:39:22.664 --> 00:39:27.050
by space, by lots of limiting
resources.

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:32.813
As populations increase in
density, the individuals shift

00:39:32.813 --> 00:39:35.179
along reaction norms.
 

00:39:35.179 --> 00:39:39.329
They reduce growth,
they are smaller;

00:39:39.329 --> 00:39:42.599
when they become adults they
experience more variation in

00:39:42.599 --> 00:39:45.114
adult size;
they have lower fecundity and

00:39:45.114 --> 00:39:48.996
more variation in fecundity;
and they have higher mortality

00:39:48.996 --> 00:39:53.036
and more variation in mortality,
as they encounter density

00:39:53.036 --> 00:39:54.030
dependence.
 

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:58.570
Now if you have a successful
species--okay?

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:02.268
So it's a dominant species in
its local habitat,

00:40:02.268 --> 00:40:06.025
in its ecosystem,
then intra-specific

00:40:06.025 --> 00:40:08.858
competition,
where these kinds of things are

00:40:08.858 --> 00:40:11.014
going on,
is often a more important brake

00:40:11.014 --> 00:40:13.599
on its growth than
inter-specific competition.

00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:15.920
And that's because,
because it's dominant,

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:19.146
it's numerically abundant,
and the average interaction

00:40:19.146 --> 00:40:22.797
that an individual has is with
another individual of the same

00:40:22.797 --> 00:40:24.570
species,
rather than with some

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:26.110
individual from another species.
 

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:29.260
So that would be a circumstance
under which we could expect that

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.693
intra-specific competition,
generating all of these

00:40:32.693 --> 00:40:35.719
effects, is likely to be
important.

00:40:35.719 --> 00:40:39.402
If the species are rare,
or if they're often at a low

00:40:39.402 --> 00:40:42.871
population density,
then the opposite might be the

00:40:42.871 --> 00:40:45.260
case;
then the interactions with

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:49.030
other species may be generating
these kinds of effects.

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:52.606
But whether the effects are
generated by interactions with

00:40:52.606 --> 00:40:55.179
other individuals of your own
species,

00:40:55.179 --> 00:40:59.007
or individuals of another
species, the impact of increased

00:40:59.007 --> 00:41:02.768
overall density is likely to be
qualitatively similar.

00:41:02.768 --> 00:41:07.490
It's going to produce reduced
growth, smaller adult size,

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:10.273
lower fecundity,
higher mortality,

00:41:10.273 --> 00:41:14.489
and more variation in all of
these parameters.

00:41:14.489 --> 00:41:16.989
Okay, next time we're going to
do competition between species.

00:41:16.989 --> 00:41:20.070
But we have a few minutes this
morning,

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:22.670
because I managed to get
through this one a little more

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:25.460
quickly than usual,
and so I would be happy to take

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:28.239
questions on anything,
if you wanted to ask;

00:41:28.239 --> 00:41:29.659
and we have about five minutes.
 

00:41:29.659 --> 00:41:36.690
&gt;
 

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:39.501
You know, a lack of questions
means that everything is just so

00:41:39.501 --> 00:41:42.358
stunningly clear that everybody
could explain it perfectly well

00:41:42.358 --> 00:41:43.050
themselves.
 

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:49.909
Fantastic.
 

00:41:49.909 --> 00:41:53.056
I once had the experience,
when I was in my first year of

00:41:53.056 --> 00:41:56.315
graduate school in British
Columbia, of being asked to be a

00:41:56.315 --> 00:41:56.710
TA.
 

00:41:56.710 --> 00:42:00.090
I had arrived in January,
and I was asked to be a TA in

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:02.971
Spring semester,
and I was a TA in a statistics

00:42:02.971 --> 00:42:03.659
course.
 

00:42:03.659 --> 00:42:06.510
And I stepped into this
statistics course and discovered

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:09.414
that even though the Fall
semester had been taught by one

00:42:09.414 --> 00:42:12.940
of the greatest teachers at the
University of British Columbia,

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:16.222
a man who was revered for the
clarity of his lectures and for

00:42:16.222 --> 00:42:18.409
the engagement of his speaking
style,

00:42:18.409 --> 00:42:21.081
that the students,
in fact, knew very little

00:42:21.081 --> 00:42:21.889
statistics.
 

00:42:21.889 --> 00:42:27.347
And the problem was that they
had thought, because he was so

00:42:27.347 --> 00:42:31.139
clear, that they understood
everything.

00:42:31.139 --> 00:42:34.099
That was not the case.
 

00:42:34.099 --> 00:42:36.699
They couldn't understand it
until they explained it

00:42:36.699 --> 00:42:39.559
themselves, and they discovered
they couldn't explain it

00:42:39.559 --> 00:42:40.340
themselves.
 

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:44.539
Any questions?
 

00:42:44.539 --> 00:42:48.300
Have a good day.

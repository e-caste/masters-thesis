00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.192
Professor Shelly Kagan:
Last time we turned to questions

00:00:04.192 --> 00:00:06.668
about the morality of suicide,
and I started with two

00:00:06.668 --> 00:00:09.240
arguments that I called quick
and dirty arguments.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.422
I suppose it would have been
fairer to say that they were

00:00:11.422 --> 00:00:15.950
really theological arguments,
or they were moral arguments

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.930
that used, in part,
theological premises.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.090
I suggested that,
at least if we look at them in

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.523
their quick and dirty versions,
they were inadequate,

00:00:27.523 --> 00:00:30.931
and if we're going to make a
more careful argument about the

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:34.420
morality of suicide,
we need to turn to a more

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.570
systematic view about the
contents of morality.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.774
We need to look at suicide in
terms of the basic moral

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:44.420
principles.
Now, that's not something we've

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.140
got the chance to do in detail,
but I think we can at least say

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.680
enough about a couple of basic
approaches to the contents of

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.864
morality,
or the basic moral rules,

00:00:53.864 --> 00:00:56.768
to get the beginnings of an
understanding of what might

00:00:56.768 --> 00:00:59.834
emerge about the morality of
suicide if we were to do that

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:03.036
more carefully.
So, holding off on suicide for

00:01:03.036 --> 00:01:07.502
the moment, let's ask ourselves,
what is it that makes an action

00:01:07.502 --> 00:01:10.549
morally acceptable or morally
forbidden?

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.398
This is, unsurprisingly,
something that different moral

00:01:13.398 --> 00:01:17.065
theories disagree about.
But there's at least one factor

00:01:17.065 --> 00:01:19.878
or one feature that all,
or almost all,

00:01:19.878 --> 00:01:23.767
moral theories agree about.
And that is that the

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:26.769
consequences of your action
matter.

00:01:26.769 --> 00:01:29.913
That is, we might or might not
think that consequences are the

00:01:29.913 --> 00:01:32.851
only things that are
morally relevant when we think

00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:34.810
about the morality of your
action,

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.877
but surely it is one
thing that's morally

00:01:37.877 --> 00:01:41.075
relevant--what are the
consequences of your action

00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:44.208
going to be.
So, let's think about the

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:48.720
morality of suicide with an eye
towards consequences,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.563
bearing in mind that since
we're talking about a moral

00:01:51.563 --> 00:01:54.835
point of view we need to take
into account the consequences as

00:01:54.835 --> 00:01:57.659
they affect everybody.
Now, the person who,

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.374
of course, is most affected by
suicide is, of course,

00:02:01.374 --> 00:02:04.090
the person who is killing
themself.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.371
And at first glance it might
seem pretty clear that the

00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:10.409
consequences of suicide are bad
for that person.

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:14.128
After all, the person was alive
and now they're dead,

00:02:14.128 --> 00:02:17.990
and we normally would take
death to be a bad result.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.183
If I were to tell you,
"Oh, here's a switch on the

00:02:21.183 --> 00:02:23.335
wall.
If you were to flip the switch,

00:02:23.335 --> 00:02:26.507
a thousand people who would
otherwise be alive would end up

00:02:26.507 --> 00:02:28.745
dead,"
you would normally take that to

00:02:28.745 --> 00:02:32.180
be a pretty compelling argument
against flipping the switch.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.956
Why?
Because the result would be

00:02:33.956 --> 00:02:34.572
bad.
Why?

00:02:34.572 --> 00:02:37.639
Because a thousand people would
end up dead.

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:41.590
Well, one person ending up dead
isn't as bad as a thousand

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.125
people ending up dead,
but for all that shouldn't we

00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:47.690
still say it's a bad
consequence?

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.395
And as a result of that,
shouldn't we say that however

00:02:51.395 --> 00:02:55.730
far appeal to consequences goes
in terms of giving us our moral

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.901
theory,
don't we have to say in terms

00:02:57.901 --> 00:03:00.270
of consequences,
or with regard to consequences,

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.580
suicide is immoral?
But not so quick!

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.799
Even though it's true that
normally death is a bad thing,

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.159
it's not always a bad thing.
This is the sort of thing that

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.430
we've learned by thinking about
what does the badness of death

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.795
consist in.
Typical cases are ones in which

00:03:20.795 --> 00:03:25.411
the person's dying robs them of
a chunk of life that would've

00:03:25.411 --> 00:03:29.902
been good for them overall,
and because of that dying then

00:03:29.902 --> 00:03:33.205
is bad for them.
But in the kinds of cases that

00:03:33.205 --> 00:03:36.578
we're thinking about,
cases where suicide would be

00:03:36.578 --> 00:03:39.864
rationally acceptable,
and we're now asking whether or

00:03:39.864 --> 00:03:42.590
not it's morally acceptable--in
those sorts of cases,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.287
at least the kind of paradigm
examples that we've been focused

00:03:46.287 --> 00:03:48.470
on, the person is better off
dead.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.545
They're better off dead,
meaning that what life now

00:03:51.545 --> 00:03:55.235
holds out for them--although
perhaps not negative through and

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:59.129
through--is negative on balance.
It's negative on balance;

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.630
they're not better off
continuing to live.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.590
They're better off dying.
And that means,

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.634
of course, that dying isn't bad
for them, but rather good for

00:04:08.634 --> 00:04:11.375
them,
and so their death is not a bad

00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:14.689
consequence, but rather a good
consequence.

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:18.576
Provided that you're prepared
to accept the possibility of

00:04:18.576 --> 00:04:22.802
cases in which somebody would be
better off if their life ended

00:04:22.802 --> 00:04:26.723
sooner rather than later,
we're led to the conclusion

00:04:26.723 --> 00:04:30.683
that--from the moral point of
view as far as focusing on

00:04:30.683 --> 00:04:34.426
consequences goes--the
consequences might actually be

00:04:34.426 --> 00:04:38.889
good rather than bad if the
person were to kill themself.

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.269
They will free themself,
let's suppose,

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:47.250
of the suffering they would
otherwise have to undergo.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.409
Well, that's--first glance
said, consequences says

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.745
suicide's wrong.
Second glance says,

00:04:52.745 --> 00:04:55.035
consequences says,
as least in certain

00:04:55.035 --> 00:04:57.139
circumstances,
suicide's right.

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.486
Of course, third glance
suggests, we can't just focus on

00:05:01.486 --> 00:05:06.149
consequences for the person who
is contemplating suicide.

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:09.350
Because from the point of view
of morality we have to look at

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.578
the consequences for everybody.
Who else might get affected by

00:05:14.578 --> 00:05:18.740
the death or suicide of the
person?

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.417
Well, the most obvious people
for us to think about at that

00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:26.221
point then are the family and
loved ones--the people who most

00:05:26.221 --> 00:05:29.454
directly know about and care
about the person who is

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:33.286
contemplating suicide.
And again--I'm running out of

00:05:33.286 --> 00:05:36.691
glances, but at first glance you
might say, well,

00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:39.670
there the consequences are
clearly bad.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.548
When the person kills themself
that causes, typically,

00:05:43.548 --> 00:05:47.718
a great deal of distress for
the family and friends of the

00:05:47.718 --> 00:05:51.858
person who has killed themself.
Even if that's true,

00:05:51.858 --> 00:05:55.647
we now have to ask,
how do the consequences weigh

00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:58.507
out?
After all, we live in a world

00:05:58.507 --> 00:06:03.360
in which no single act typically
has only good consequences,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.139
or no single act has bad
consequences and only bad

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:08.728
consequences.
Often our choices are mixed

00:06:08.728 --> 00:06:12.593
packages where we have to ask
whether the good that we can do

00:06:12.593 --> 00:06:16.328
is greater than the bad that
we'd be doing with this act or

00:06:16.328 --> 00:06:19.408
that act or some third act.
Even if there are,

00:06:19.408 --> 00:06:23.029
then, negative consequences in
terms of distress to the family,

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:25.935
friends, and loved ones,
of the person who kills

00:06:25.935 --> 00:06:29.705
themself, that might still be
outweighed by the benefit to the

00:06:29.705 --> 00:06:33.297
person himself or herself,
if it was really the case that

00:06:33.297 --> 00:06:35.440
he or she would be better off
dying.

00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:43.942
But it's also worth bearing in
mind that insofar as we're

00:06:43.942 --> 00:06:49.048
thinking about people who love
and care about the person who is

00:06:49.048 --> 00:06:54.061
considering dying,
then they may actually overall,

00:06:54.061 --> 00:07:00.257
on balance, be relieved that
the suffering of their loved one

00:07:00.257 --> 00:07:04.423
has come to an end.
We will, of course,

00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:09.606
all be horribly distressed that
nature, or the Fates,

00:07:09.606 --> 00:07:13.547
or what have you,
has brought it about that this

00:07:13.547 --> 00:07:17.570
person's choices are now reduced
to killing themself on the one

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.074
hand,
or continuing the terminal

00:07:20.074 --> 00:07:24.349
stages of some illness where
they're incapacitated and in

00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:26.475
pain.
We will, of course,

00:07:26.475 --> 00:07:29.906
wish there was a serious
prospect of a cure,

00:07:29.906 --> 00:07:34.294
some chance of recovery,
wish they'd never gotten ill in

00:07:34.294 --> 00:07:38.253
the first place.
But given the limited choices,

00:07:38.253 --> 00:07:41.829
continued suffering and pain,
on the one hand,

00:07:41.829 --> 00:07:45.521
or having an end to that
suffering and pain,

00:07:45.521 --> 00:07:50.157
if the person can rationally
assess their prospects and

00:07:50.157 --> 00:07:54.879
reasonably come to believe
they're better off dead,

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:59.197
then that's a judgment their
loved ones can come to share as

00:07:59.197 --> 00:08:01.369
well.
They may well regret the

00:08:01.369 --> 00:08:04.826
fact--more than regret,
curse the fact--that

00:08:04.826 --> 00:08:07.730
these are the only choices
they've got,

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.098
but still, given the limited
choices they may agree,

00:08:11.098 --> 00:08:15.123
they may come to agree,
better to put an end to the

00:08:15.123 --> 00:08:18.020
suffering.
And so when the person kills

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.709
themself, they may second that
choice.

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:24.516
They may say,
"At least they're not in pain

00:08:24.516 --> 00:08:28.310
and agony anymore."
So, if we look at it from the

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.788
point of view of
consequences--in fact,

00:08:30.788 --> 00:08:34.439
suppose we had a moral view
that said consequences aren't

00:08:34.439 --> 00:08:38.482
just one thing that was morally
relevant in thinking about what

00:08:38.482 --> 00:08:42.887
makes an action right or wrong.
Suppose we took the bold claim

00:08:42.887 --> 00:08:46.870
that consequences are the only
thing that's morally relevant.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.539
There are moral views that take
this position.

00:08:49.539 --> 00:08:52.838
I suppose the best-known
example of this kind of

00:08:52.838 --> 00:08:56.909
consequence-only approach to
morality is utilitarianism.

00:08:56.909 --> 00:09:00.814
Utilitarianism is the moral
doctrine that says right and

00:09:00.814 --> 00:09:05.144
wrong is a matter of producing
as much happiness for everybody

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:08.426
as possible,
counting everybody's happiness

00:09:08.426 --> 00:09:10.668
equally.
And when you can't produce

00:09:10.668 --> 00:09:14.174
happiness, then at least trying
to minimize the misery and

00:09:14.174 --> 00:09:18.110
suffering, counting everybody's
misery and suffering equally.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:22.570
So, suppose we accept this
utilitarian position.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:27.461
What conclusions would we come
to then about the morality of

00:09:27.461 --> 00:09:30.805
suicide?
I suppose the conclusion would

00:09:30.805 --> 00:09:34.436
be a kind of moderate one.
On the one hand,

00:09:34.436 --> 00:09:39.131
we'd be rejecting the extreme
that says suicide is never

00:09:39.131 --> 00:09:42.574
morally acceptable,
because to say that,

00:09:42.574 --> 00:09:46.252
you'd have to be claiming
suicide always has bad

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:49.267
consequences overall.
And that strikes me,

00:09:49.267 --> 00:09:52.566
although it's an empirical
claim, it strikes me as a rather

00:09:52.566 --> 00:09:55.855
implausible empirical claim.
It's, sadly enough,

00:09:55.855 --> 00:10:00.592
not too difficult to describe
cases in which the results may

00:10:00.592 --> 00:10:05.249
actually be better if the person
kills themself rather than

00:10:05.249 --> 00:10:10.437
having their suffering continue.
It may be better for them and

00:10:10.437 --> 00:10:13.459
better for their family.
On the other hand,

00:10:13.459 --> 00:10:17.095
we certainly wouldn't want--if
we were utilitarians--we also

00:10:17.095 --> 00:10:20.669
wouldn't want to go to the other
extreme and say suicide is

00:10:20.669 --> 00:10:23.779
always morally acceptable,
because, of course,

00:10:23.779 --> 00:10:27.565
to say that it's always morally
acceptable is to say that the

00:10:27.565 --> 00:10:30.909
consequences are never bad when
you kill yourself.

00:10:30.909 --> 00:10:34.723
And that's also pretty
obviously an implausible thing

00:10:34.723 --> 00:10:36.816
to claim.
You guys are young,

00:10:36.816 --> 00:10:39.726
you're healthy,
you've got a great future in

00:10:39.726 --> 00:10:42.186
front of you.
If you were to kill yourself,

00:10:42.186 --> 00:10:45.527
the results wouldn't be good.
The results would be worse

00:10:45.527 --> 00:10:49.730
overall than if you had
refrained from killing yourself.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.139
So, the utilitarian position is
in the middle.

00:10:53.139 --> 00:10:56.545
It doesn't say suicide's never
acceptable, doesn't say suicide

00:10:56.545 --> 00:10:59.234
is always acceptable.
It says, perhaps

00:10:59.234 --> 00:11:03.010
unsurprisingly,
it's sometimes acceptable;

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:06.179
it depends on the facts.
It depends on the results.

00:11:06.179 --> 00:11:11.273
It depends on comparing the
results of this action,

00:11:11.273 --> 00:11:15.755
killing yourself,
to the alternatives open to

00:11:15.755 --> 00:11:18.232
you.
We have to ask,

00:11:18.232 --> 00:11:21.889
is your life worse than
nothing?

00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:26.254
Is there some medical procedure
available to you that would cure

00:11:26.254 --> 00:11:27.170
you?
If there is,

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:28.963
and even if your life is worse
than nothing,

00:11:28.963 --> 00:11:31.339
that still doesn't make it the
best choice in terms of the

00:11:31.339 --> 00:11:33.826
consequences.
Getting medical help is a

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:37.159
preferable choice in terms of
the consequences.

00:11:37.159 --> 00:11:41.016
We can even think of cases
where your life is worse than

00:11:41.016 --> 00:11:43.539
nothing, you'd be better off
dead,

00:11:43.539 --> 00:11:46.433
and there is no medical
alternative of a cure available

00:11:46.433 --> 00:11:49.690
to you, but for all that,
it still isn't morally

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:53.063
legitimate to kill yourself in
terms of the utilitarian

00:11:53.063 --> 00:11:54.989
outlook.
Because, as always,

00:11:54.989 --> 00:11:58.379
we have to think about the
consequences for others.

00:11:58.379 --> 00:12:03.230
And there may be others who'd
be so adversely affected by your

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:07.603
death that the harm to them
outweighs the cost to you of

00:12:07.603 --> 00:12:11.514
keeping yourself alive.
Suppose, for example,

00:12:11.514 --> 00:12:15.629
that you're the single parent
of young children.

00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:19.929
You've got a kind of moral
obligation to look after them.

00:12:19.929 --> 00:12:26.779
If you were to die,
they'd really have it horribly.

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:29.747
It's conceivable then,
in cases like that,

00:12:29.747 --> 00:12:34.090
the suffering of your children,
were you to kill yourself,

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:38.110
would outweigh the suffering
that you'd have to undergo were

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:42.130
you to keep yourself alive for
the sake of your children.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:47.293
So, it all depends on the facts.
Still, if we accept the

00:12:47.293 --> 00:12:52.478
utilitarian position,
we do end up with a moderate

00:12:52.478 --> 00:12:56.225
conclusion.
In certain circumstances

00:12:56.225 --> 00:13:01.230
suicide will be morally
justified--roughly speaking,

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:06.997
in those cases where you're
better off dead and the effects

00:13:06.997 --> 00:13:11.769
on others aren't so great as to
outweigh that.

00:13:11.769 --> 00:13:16.094
Those will be the paradigm
cases in which suicide makes

00:13:16.094 --> 00:13:19.297
sense or is legitimate,
morally speaking,

00:13:19.297 --> 00:13:22.259
from the utilitarian
perspective.

00:13:22.259 --> 00:13:24.960
But of course,
that doesn't mean that suicide

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.169
is indeed ever morally
legitimate.

00:13:27.169 --> 00:13:31.167
Because we don't necessarily
want to embrace the utilitarian

00:13:31.167 --> 00:13:34.930
theory of morality.
Utilitarianism is what you get,

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:38.555
roughly speaking,
when we say consequences matter

00:13:38.555 --> 00:13:41.500
and they're all that
matters.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:47.291
But most of us are inclined to
think that there's more to

00:13:47.291 --> 00:13:51.972
morality than consequences.
Most of us are inclined to

00:13:51.972 --> 00:13:55.530
think that there are cases in
which actions can have bad

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:59.252
results--rather,
actions can have good results

00:13:59.252 --> 00:14:03.120
and yet, for all that,
be morally forbidden.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.584
Or actions could have bad
results and yet,

00:14:05.584 --> 00:14:08.110
for all that,
still be morally required.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:12.001
That's not to say that
consequences don't matter

00:14:12.001 --> 00:14:13.746
morally;
it's to claim,

00:14:13.746 --> 00:14:17.218
rather, that consequences
aren't the only thing

00:14:17.218 --> 00:14:20.834
that matters morally.
Consequences can be outweighed

00:14:20.834 --> 00:14:23.220
by other morally relevant
factors.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:29.272
Well, that's the position
that's held by the branch of

00:14:29.272 --> 00:14:33.269
moral theory known as
deontology.

00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:38.565
So deontologists say other
things matter morally besides

00:14:38.565 --> 00:14:41.323
consequences.
In deciding whether your action

00:14:41.323 --> 00:14:43.272
is right or wrong,
you have to pay attention to

00:14:43.272 --> 00:14:46.321
the consequences,
but you have to pay attention

00:14:46.321 --> 00:14:49.179
to other things as well.
What other things?

00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:53.001
Well, unsurprisingly,
this is an area then in which

00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:57.205
different deontologists will
disagree one to the next in

00:14:57.205 --> 00:15:01.562
terms of what else they want to
add to the list of morally

00:15:01.562 --> 00:15:05.134
relevant factors.
But there's one kind of

00:15:05.134 --> 00:15:09.787
additional factor that most of
us in our deontological moods

00:15:09.787 --> 00:15:13.810
would want to add to the list,
and that's this--so one,

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.942
at any rate,
that's relevant I think,

00:15:15.942 --> 00:15:19.080
most directly relevant for
thinking about suicide.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:24.677
That factor is the factor of
not just what was the upshot of

00:15:24.677 --> 00:15:29.799
your action but how you
produced that upshot;

00:15:29.799 --> 00:15:34.701
not just what the results were,
but what was your means

00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:39.120
of getting those results and
more particularly still,

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:44.750
did you have to harm
anybody to produce the results?

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:50.398
Most of us are inclined to
think it's wrong to harm people,

00:15:50.398 --> 00:15:55.122
or at least innocent people.
It's wrong to harm innocent

00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:58.860
people even if the results of
doing that might be good.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.883
Now, I threw in the
qualification about innocent

00:16:01.883 --> 00:16:04.779
people because,
of course, it's also true that

00:16:04.779 --> 00:16:08.510
most of us are inclined to think
that self-defense might be

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.894
justified.
Harming people who are

00:16:10.894 --> 00:16:14.833
attacking you or your friends or
your fellow countrymen--that may

00:16:14.833 --> 00:16:17.958
be legitimate.
And so it's not as though we

00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:21.820
want to say it's never
legitimate to harm somebody.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:25.019
But those people are guilty;
they're aggressors.

00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:28.756
What most of us in our
deontological moods are inclined

00:16:28.756 --> 00:16:31.731
to think is it's never
legitimate to harm an

00:16:31.731 --> 00:16:36.640
innocent person.
And the crucial point is that's

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.759
true even if the results would
be better.

00:16:40.759 --> 00:16:44.986
Look, there's no debate between
deontologists and utilitarians

00:16:44.986 --> 00:16:48.519
about harming innocent people in
the normal case,

00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:50.558
because normally of course--you
know, suppose I,

00:16:50.558 --> 00:16:53.159
to make an example--to end the
class with a nice big bang,

00:16:53.159 --> 00:16:56.340
right--I brought my Uzi
sub-machine gun.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.751
I now take it and go
rat-a-tat-tat,

00:16:58.751 --> 00:17:02.009
killing 15 of you.
Well, that would not be

00:17:02.009 --> 00:17:05.210
something that would have good
results.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:09.034
And so, clearly,
the utilitarian is going to

00:17:09.034 --> 00:17:12.770
reject that as well as the
deontologist.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.289
They're in agreement about that.
In the typical case,

00:17:15.289 --> 00:17:18.230
killing an innocent person has
bad results, harms them.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:20.390
It's wrong, full stop,
we're done.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:26.961
But what should we say about
cases where killing an innocent

00:17:26.961 --> 00:17:30.963
person has better results?
In real life,

00:17:30.963 --> 00:17:34.839
it's hard to think of cases
like that, but we can at least

00:17:34.839 --> 00:17:37.900
go "science-fictiony" and tell
an example.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:43.180
So, here is one of my favorite
examples in moral philosophy.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:47.529
Suppose that we have five
patients in a hospital who are

00:17:47.529 --> 00:17:52.589
going to die because of organ
failures of one sort or another.

00:17:52.589 --> 00:17:55.743
One of them needs a heart
transplant, one of them needs a

00:17:55.743 --> 00:17:58.164
kidney transplant,
one of them needs a liver

00:17:58.164 --> 00:18:00.359
transplant, and so forth and so
on.

00:18:00.359 --> 00:18:02.577
Unfortunately,
because of tissue

00:18:02.577 --> 00:18:05.868
incompatibilities,
even as they begin to die we

00:18:05.868 --> 00:18:10.160
can't use the organs from the
ones that have died to save the

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.352
others.
Meanwhile, here in the hospital

00:18:14.352 --> 00:18:19.839
for a routine check-up is John.
John's perfectly healthy.

00:18:19.839 --> 00:18:24.988
And as you're doing your exams
on him you discover that he's

00:18:24.988 --> 00:18:29.875
exactly suitable to be an organ
donor for all five of the

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:33.359
patients.
And it occurs to you that if

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:38.393
you were to find some way to
kill him, but cover up the cause

00:18:38.393 --> 00:18:43.259
of death so it looked like he
died of some unexpected freak

00:18:43.259 --> 00:18:46.700
seizure,
you could then use his organs

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.415
to save the five.
This one gets the kidney,

00:18:49.415 --> 00:18:52.177
that one gets the other kidney,
that one gets the heart,

00:18:52.177 --> 00:18:54.990
that one gets the liver,
and that one gets the lungs.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.950
So your choice,
roughly, is this.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:01.586
Just give John his routine
medical exam,

00:19:01.586 --> 00:19:05.690
in which case the five other
patients die,

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:09.303
or chop up John,
kill him and chop him up,

00:19:09.303 --> 00:19:13.269
using his organs to save the
five patients.

00:19:13.269 --> 00:19:18.535
Well, what should we say is the
right thing to do the organ

00:19:18.535 --> 00:19:22.154
transplant case?
In terms of consequences it

00:19:22.154 --> 00:19:25.461
looks as though,
if we tell the story right at

00:19:25.461 --> 00:19:29.650
least, the results would be
better if we chop up John.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:33.474
After all, it's one versus five.
And although the death of John

00:19:33.474 --> 00:19:36.234
is a horrible bad result,
the death of the five is a

00:19:36.234 --> 00:19:39.830
horrible bad result.
And so the results would be

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:43.400
better if we were to kill
innocent John.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.514
Well, if we had more time we
could argue about are the

00:19:45.514 --> 00:19:46.950
results really going to be
better,

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.422
is that a realistic story--what
have you--are there other

00:19:49.422 --> 00:19:51.761
long-term effects on the
healthcare profession that we

00:19:51.761 --> 00:19:54.896
haven't taken into account?
But we don't have time to

00:19:54.896 --> 00:19:57.440
really pursue this story in
detail.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.732
Let's just suppose we could
eventually get the details

00:20:01.732 --> 00:20:04.630
right;
the results really would be

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:08.519
better if we chopped up John.
Is that the right thing to do?

00:20:08.519 --> 00:20:11.489
Well, maybe utilitarianism says
it's the right thing to do,

00:20:11.489 --> 00:20:14.304
but it's precisely for that
reason that most of us would

00:20:14.304 --> 00:20:16.612
then say,
you know, there's more to

00:20:16.612 --> 00:20:19.240
morality than what
utilitarianism says.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.990
Now, whether that objection is
a good one is a very,

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:26.804
very complicated question,
and if you want--if you'd like

00:20:26.804 --> 00:20:30.255
to pursue it--if you want to
pursue it--then I invite you to

00:20:30.255 --> 00:20:33.180
take an introductory class in
moral philosophy.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.606
For our purposes,
let's just suppose that most of

00:20:36.606 --> 00:20:40.247
us are on board with the
deontologists when they say

00:20:40.247 --> 00:20:44.460
there's more to morality than
what the utilitarian has,

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:49.206
and this example brings it out.
It's wrong to kill somebody who

00:20:49.206 --> 00:20:53.594
is innocent even though by
hypothesis the results would be

00:20:53.594 --> 00:20:58.337
better--it's five to one.
People have a right to life,

00:20:58.337 --> 00:21:02.570
a right not to be killed.
And that right weighs in when

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:06.041
we're deciding what to do
morally, so that it's wrong to

00:21:06.041 --> 00:21:09.702
kill an innocent person even if
the results really would be

00:21:09.702 --> 00:21:12.515
better.
All right, let's suppose we

00:21:12.515 --> 00:21:16.326
agree with that--accept that.
Again, in a fuller class on

00:21:16.326 --> 00:21:19.718
moral philosophy we'd have to
ask ourselves what is the basis

00:21:19.718 --> 00:21:22.358
of that right,
what other deontological rights

00:21:22.358 --> 00:21:24.739
do people have,
what exactly are the contours

00:21:24.739 --> 00:21:27.178
of that right?
But here we can just ask,

00:21:27.178 --> 00:21:30.881
suppose we accept a right like
that, what are the implications

00:21:30.881 --> 00:21:33.250
of that for the morality of
suicide?

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:38.860
And now, it seems what we have
to say is, suicide is wrong.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:43.972
Suicide is morally unacceptable.
Because when I kill myself,

00:21:43.972 --> 00:21:47.911
well, I'm killing somebody.
And didn't we just say as

00:21:47.911 --> 00:21:51.364
deontologists that killing an
innocent person--and I'm an

00:21:51.364 --> 00:21:54.631
innocent person--killing an
innocent person is morally

00:21:54.631 --> 00:21:57.039
wrong?
Well, I'm a person.

00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:59.880
So, killing me is
morally wrong.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.810
And it's not really any help to
come back and say,

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:08.784
but look, we've stipulated that
this is a case where the person

00:22:08.784 --> 00:22:12.571
is better off dead.
The results will really be

00:22:12.571 --> 00:22:15.260
better overall if he kills
himself.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.309
Yeah, that's right.
Maybe that is right.

00:22:18.309 --> 00:22:22.839
It doesn't matter--because as
deontologists we said the right

00:22:22.839 --> 00:22:26.690
to life is so powerful it
outweighs consequences.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:30.880
Just as it was wrong to chop up
John, even though the results

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.442
would be better--five versus
one--it's wrong to kill

00:22:34.442 --> 00:22:37.601
yourself,
 even if the results would

00:22:37.601 --> 00:22:39.567
be better.
Even if that's the only way to

00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:41.677
put yourself out of pain,
and those are good results,

00:22:41.677 --> 00:22:44.970
it doesn't matter.
The right to life outweighs the

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:49.275
appeal to consequences.
So as deontologists,

00:22:49.275 --> 00:22:56.279
it seems, we have to say
suicide is forbidden--full stop.

00:22:56.279 --> 00:22:59.328
Well, as usual in philosophy,
it's not quite as simple as

00:22:59.328 --> 00:23:02.563
that.
One possible response somebody

00:23:02.563 --> 00:23:06.367
might make is,
but look, morality is only

00:23:06.367 --> 00:23:12.096
about how I treat others.
It's not about how I treat

00:23:12.096 --> 00:23:15.376
myself.
And if we were to accept that

00:23:15.376 --> 00:23:20.130
claim, then we could say the
right to life only covers how I

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:22.166
treat others.
In particular,

00:23:22.166 --> 00:23:25.203
it rules out my killing other
people even when the results

00:23:25.203 --> 00:23:27.689
would be good.
But it doesn't have any

00:23:27.689 --> 00:23:30.230
implications for how I treat
myself.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:34.673
And in particular then,
if the right to life doesn't

00:23:34.673 --> 00:23:38.333
exclude self-killing,
well then, suicide is

00:23:38.333 --> 00:23:42.355
acceptable.
That's a possible moral view,

00:23:42.355 --> 00:23:45.539
but I find it rather
implausible.

00:23:45.539 --> 00:23:50.749
If we were to start to explain
what it is about you that

00:23:50.749 --> 00:23:54.529
explains why it's wrong for me
to kill you,

00:23:54.529 --> 00:23:57.480
we'd start saying things about
how, well, you're a person and,

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.430
as such, you've got all these
plans and so forth and so on.

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:03.728
And as a person,
you've got certain rights,

00:24:03.728 --> 00:24:07.420
certain things that shouldn't
be done to you.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.924
You're not just,
--This is the thought that lies

00:24:09.924 --> 00:24:12.270
behind much deontological
thinking, right?

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:16.021
People aren't objects.
We can't just destroy them for

00:24:16.021 --> 00:24:19.080
the sake of better results.
Well, that's right;

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:24.500
people aren't objects.
But of course, I'm a person too.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:28.154
And so when I contemplate
killing myself,

00:24:28.154 --> 00:24:31.809
I'm contemplating destroying a
person.

00:24:31.809 --> 00:24:37.285
So, it's at least difficult to
see why we would accept the

00:24:37.285 --> 00:24:43.049
claim that morality only governs
how I treat other people.

00:24:43.049 --> 00:24:46.802
It seems--although the issue is
a complicated one,

00:24:46.802 --> 00:24:51.167
which we don't have time to
pursue further today--it seems

00:24:51.167 --> 00:24:55.685
to me more plausible to say
morality includes rules not only

00:24:55.685 --> 00:25:00.509
governing how I treat others but
also how I treat myself.

00:25:00.509 --> 00:25:03.220
Yet, if that's right,
and if among the moral rules

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.931
are a right to life,
a prohibition against harming

00:25:05.931 --> 00:25:06.540
people,

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:16.396
then don't we have to say,
look, it's wrong from the

00:25:16.396 --> 00:25:22.119
deontological perspective to
kill yourself.

00:25:22.119 --> 00:25:24.008
Well, of course,
the natural response to this

00:25:24.008 --> 00:25:25.640
line of thought is to say,
but look,

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.760
when I kill myself--unlike the
case of chopping up John to save

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:35.144
five others--when I kill myself,
I'm doing it for my own

00:25:35.144 --> 00:25:37.823
sake.
I'm harming myself for my

00:25:37.823 --> 00:25:41.228
own sake.
That seems highly relevant in

00:25:41.228 --> 00:25:44.000
thinking about the morality of
suicide.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.732
It does seem relevant,
though it's not 100 % clear

00:25:49.732 --> 00:25:52.671
what to do with that thought.
Here are two possible

00:25:52.671 --> 00:25:55.756
interpretations of that thought.
First of all,

00:25:55.756 --> 00:25:59.542
you might think that the
relevance of saying that I'm

00:25:59.542 --> 00:26:02.599
harming myself for my own sake
is this.

00:26:02.599 --> 00:26:06.113
If I'm harming myself for my
own sake, what I'm saying is,

00:26:06.113 --> 00:26:08.578
despite the fact that I'm
harming myself,

00:26:08.578 --> 00:26:11.618
I'm better off.
After all, we stipulated that

00:26:11.618 --> 00:26:15.289
we were focusing on cases in
which suicide was rational.

00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:17.069
So, the person is better off
dead.

00:26:17.069 --> 00:26:20.599
If they're better off dead,
then although it's certainly

00:26:20.599 --> 00:26:23.743
true that there's a sense in
which they're harming

00:26:23.743 --> 00:26:26.887
themself--I mean killing
yourself is doing harm to

00:26:26.887 --> 00:26:30.160
yourself--still it's not harm
overall.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.908
The bottom line,
we were imagining,

00:26:32.908 --> 00:26:35.900
is positive when you kill
yourself.

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:40.072
And so, although,
unlike the case of John where

00:26:40.072 --> 00:26:45.604
you've harmed him and benefited
others--so you have harmed him

00:26:45.604 --> 00:26:51.357
overall--in the case of suicide,
when I harm myself to avoid the

00:26:51.357 --> 00:26:55.849
suffering I would otherwise go
through, I'm not really,

00:26:55.849 --> 00:27:00.869
as we might say,
harming myself overall.

00:27:00.869 --> 00:27:05.225
So, perhaps the deontological
prohibition against harm is

00:27:05.225 --> 00:27:09.970
really a prohibition against
harming people overall.

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:15.197
Look, you've got some sort of a
disease in your--infection in

00:27:15.197 --> 00:27:20.773
your leg that has now spread and
it's going to kill you unless we

00:27:20.773 --> 00:27:24.134
amputate your leg.
So, you go into surgery and the

00:27:24.134 --> 00:27:27.819
surgeon chops off your leg.
Has he done something immoral?

00:27:27.819 --> 00:27:29.769
It doesn't seem as though he
has.

00:27:29.769 --> 00:27:32.580
But after all,
he chopped off your leg!

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.875
He harmed you!
You used to have a leg and now

00:27:34.875 --> 00:27:39.004
you don't have one.
Well, what we want to say is he

00:27:39.004 --> 00:27:43.195
didn't harm you overall.
He harmed you in such a way

00:27:43.195 --> 00:27:46.506
that it was the only way to
leave you better off bottom

00:27:46.506 --> 00:27:50.430
line, and that's not a violation
of the rule against harming.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:53.759
At least, that's a possible
thing to say.

00:27:53.759 --> 00:27:56.994
And if that's the right thing
to say, then maybe that's what

00:27:56.994 --> 00:27:59.680
we should say about the suicide
case yet again.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.579
Yeah, there's a deontological
prohibition against harming

00:28:02.579 --> 00:28:04.547
innocent people,
but what it's really a

00:28:04.547 --> 00:28:08.392
prohibition against,
is leaving them worse off

00:28:08.392 --> 00:28:11.081
overall.
And when I kill myself,

00:28:11.081 --> 00:28:14.279
I'm not leaving myself worse
off overall.

00:28:14.279 --> 00:28:16.791
And if that's right,
then even from the

00:28:16.791 --> 00:28:19.898
deontological perspective
suicide may be morally

00:28:19.898 --> 00:28:23.051
legitimate.
Well, that's at least one

00:28:23.051 --> 00:28:27.460
possible way to carry out the
deontological stand,

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.787
one possible way of
interpreting the remark,

00:28:29.787 --> 00:28:33.283
"But look, when I kill myself,
I'm doing it for my own

00:28:33.283 --> 00:28:36.465
benefit."
Here's another possible way of

00:28:36.465 --> 00:28:40.090
interpreting that thought.
When I kill myself,

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:44.748
given that I'm doing it for my
own benefit, I've obviously got

00:28:44.748 --> 00:28:49.109
my own agreement.
I can't kill myself against my

00:28:49.109 --> 00:28:52.337
will.
Suicide is something you do to

00:28:52.337 --> 00:28:55.561
yourself.
And so, I have my own consent

00:28:55.561 --> 00:29:00.430
to what I'm doing.
That seems pretty important.

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:02.640
Notice how different it is from
the case of John.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.600
When I chopped up John,
I imagine I don't have John's

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.977
approval.
Consent seems to be present in

00:29:10.977 --> 00:29:15.710
the case of suicide but not in
the case of chopping up John.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:19.839
Maybe that's morally relevant
as well.

00:29:19.839 --> 00:29:23.568
Now, to accept that view is,
of course, to say we need to

00:29:23.568 --> 00:29:27.230
add yet another factor into our
deontological theory.

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:29.230
We have consequences,
we have harm doing,

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:31.630
but we also have the factor of
consent.

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:38.650
And so we need to think about
the moral relevance of having

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:44.236
the consent of the victim.
And once we start thinking

00:29:44.236 --> 00:29:49.388
about that, I think most of us
would be inclined to accept the

00:29:49.388 --> 00:29:54.625
conclusion that consent can make
it acceptable to do to someone

00:29:54.625 --> 00:30:00.200
what would normally be wrong in
the absence of their consent.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.502
By the by, you'll notice that
that seems to be one of the

00:30:02.502 --> 00:30:04.970
things that's relevant in
thinking about the surgery case,

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:07.683
not the organ transplant case
but the performing the

00:30:07.683 --> 00:30:11.929
amputation of the leg,
to save the person who would

00:30:11.929 --> 00:30:16.207
otherwise die.
Surely it seems relevant that

00:30:16.207 --> 00:30:21.490
the patient has given you
permission to operate on them.

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:23.795
Here's another example that
shows you the relevance of

00:30:23.795 --> 00:30:26.691
consent.
It would not be okay--it would

00:30:26.691 --> 00:30:31.533
not be morally acceptable for me
to go up and hit you in the

00:30:31.533 --> 00:30:34.563
nose.
Just like it wouldn't be okay

00:30:34.563 --> 00:30:38.819
for you to go up and hit me in
the face or the gut.

00:30:38.819 --> 00:30:46.160
And yet, boxing matches are,
I suppose, morally acceptable.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.906
Why is that?
Because from a deontological

00:30:49.906 --> 00:30:54.879
perspective the answer is,
when people are boxing they've

00:30:54.879 --> 00:30:57.949
agreed to it.
I give you permission to hit

00:30:57.949 --> 00:31:01.484
me, or at least to try to hit
me, in exchange for your giving

00:31:01.484 --> 00:31:04.960
me permission to hit you,
or at least to try to hit you.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.917
And it's the presence of that
consent that makes it

00:31:08.917 --> 00:31:13.550
permissible for you to harm me,
assuming that you're a better

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:16.755
boxer than I am,
which I'm confident would have

00:31:16.755 --> 00:31:20.744
to be the case.
So, consent makes it legitimate

00:31:20.744 --> 00:31:24.626
to harm people,
even though in the absence of

00:31:24.626 --> 00:31:27.890
consent it wouldn't be
legitimate.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:31.101
All right, if that's right,
then bring that thought home to

00:31:31.101 --> 00:31:33.150
thinking about the case of
suicide.

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:37.912
Suicide might be wrong,
because after all I'm a person,

00:31:37.912 --> 00:31:42.291
at first glance.
But since I'm killing myself,

00:31:42.291 --> 00:31:47.754
I've given myself permission.
I've given myself consent to

00:31:47.754 --> 00:31:50.913
harm myself.
And if consent makes it

00:31:50.913 --> 00:31:55.182
permissible to do what would
normally be forbidden,

00:31:55.182 --> 00:31:59.195
then consent makes it
permissible for me to kill

00:31:59.195 --> 00:32:02.324
myself.
And so, now we're led again to

00:32:02.324 --> 00:32:06.532
the conclusion that from a more
fully developed deontological

00:32:06.532 --> 00:32:10.319
perspective we ought to say
suicide is permissible,

00:32:10.319 --> 00:32:14.373
at least if we're prepared to
throw in this kind of factor of

00:32:14.373 --> 00:32:18.292
consent and think that it can
just wipe out the protections

00:32:18.292 --> 00:32:21.400
that would otherwise normally be
in place.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.870
Indeed, if we think that,
we're going to be led to a

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:28.613
rather bold and extreme
conclusion about the morality of

00:32:28.613 --> 00:32:31.407
suicide.
The person has killed himself,

00:32:31.407 --> 00:32:34.900
so he's clearly consented,
and so in every case

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.970
what he's done is acceptable.
Well, maybe that's right--if

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:43.240
we're prepared to go that far
with the principle of consent.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.497
But maybe we shouldn't go that
far with the principle of

00:32:46.497 --> 00:32:49.847
consent.
Suppose we're talking after

00:32:49.847 --> 00:32:54.544
class and you say to me,
"Shelly, you've got my

00:32:54.544 --> 00:32:59.614
permission to kill me."
And so I get out my gun and I

00:32:59.614 --> 00:33:03.829
shoot you to death.
It doesn't seem morally

00:33:03.829 --> 00:33:09.483
acceptable, even though you gave
me your permission,

00:33:09.483 --> 00:33:14.250
especially--Think of even
weirder cases.

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:18.733
Suppose that you are feeling
like you want to killed because

00:33:18.733 --> 00:33:22.990
you're overcome with guilt
because you believe you killed

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:26.110
John Smith.
But you're crazy.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:30.349
You didn't kill John Smith.
John Smith's not even dead.

00:33:30.349 --> 00:33:33.632
But in your insanity you think
you did do it,

00:33:33.632 --> 00:33:36.839
and so you say,
"Shelly, please kill me."

00:33:36.839 --> 00:33:40.012
And I know that you're insane,
but hey, you know,

00:33:40.012 --> 00:33:42.589
consent's consent,
and so I kill you.

00:33:42.589 --> 00:33:45.890
Well, that clearly isn't
acceptable.

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:51.589
Or suppose you're playing with
your three-year-old nephew.

00:33:51.589 --> 00:33:53.099
He says, "Oh yeah,
I don't really like being

00:33:53.099 --> 00:33:54.549
alive.
Kill me."

00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:59.821
Well, that clearly doesn't make
it acceptable to kill him or

00:33:59.821 --> 00:34:02.680
her--well, nephew,
it's a him.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:06.801
So, if we start accepting this
consent principle,

00:34:06.801 --> 00:34:11.179
we're led to some pretty
implausible conclusions.

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.239
So, maybe we should throw it
out.

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:15.592
Maybe we should say,
no, consent really doesn't have

00:34:15.592 --> 00:34:18.360
the kind of power that a minute
ago it looked like it did.

00:34:21.539 --> 00:34:26.355
But I'm inclined to think we
shouldn't go that far and throw

00:34:26.355 --> 00:34:29.619
away the consent principle
altogether.

00:34:29.619 --> 00:34:33.163
Because if we do throw out the
consent principle,

00:34:33.163 --> 00:34:37.667
we're going to find ourselves
unable to say some things that I

00:34:37.667 --> 00:34:40.990
think it's pretty important to
us to say.

00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:46.598
Consider the following example.
Suppose that we're in war and

00:34:46.598 --> 00:34:53.070
we're in the foxhole and a hand
grenade has been thrown into the

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:56.417
foxhole.
And unless something happens

00:34:56.417 --> 00:35:01.327
quick, the hand grenade is going
to blow up and it will kill my

00:35:01.327 --> 00:35:04.969
five buddies who are near the
hand grenade.

00:35:04.969 --> 00:35:06.769
Unfortunately,
because they're playing cards

00:35:06.769 --> 00:35:09.380
or whatever, they don't see it.
But I see it.

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.849
But I don't have time to warn
them.

00:35:11.849 --> 00:35:16.379
By the time I tell them what's
going on, they won't have time

00:35:16.379 --> 00:35:18.978
to react.
Really, it's do nothing,

00:35:18.978 --> 00:35:22.810
let them get killed but I
probably won't be hurt very

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:25.779
much,
or throw myself on the hand

00:35:25.779 --> 00:35:30.450
grenade, my body absorbs the
blow, saves my buddies,

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:33.738
kills me.
Imagine what happens is that I

00:35:33.738 --> 00:35:35.460
throw myself on the hand
grenade.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:41.940
I've sacrificed myself for them.
I've done something amazing.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:45.653
Few of us would have it within
ourselves to do this,

00:35:45.653 --> 00:35:48.420
but amazingly enough some
people do.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:52.070
And we admire and praise these
people.

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:56.680
They've committed--they've
undertaken an incredible act of

00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.320
heroic self-sacrifice--morally
commendable,

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.420
above and beyond the call of
duty we want to say,

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.758
praiseworthy.
But wait a minute,

00:36:05.758 --> 00:36:09.954
how could it be praiseworthy?
The person threw himself on a

00:36:09.954 --> 00:36:12.791
hand grenade,
knowing the result of this was

00:36:12.791 --> 00:36:16.241
that he was going to die.
And so he killed a person,

00:36:16.241 --> 00:36:19.135
thereby, apparently,
violating the deontological

00:36:19.135 --> 00:36:22.030
right not to have innocent
people be killed.

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.380
Don't talk about "the results
are better."

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.250
Yeah, of course,
five buddies saved;

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:33.086
the results are better.
But that doesn't seem enough to

00:36:33.086 --> 00:36:36.999
use in our deontological moods.
After all, suppose that I see

00:36:36.999 --> 00:36:40.068
the hand grenade,
and so what I do is I take

00:36:40.068 --> 00:36:42.780
Jones and throw him on the
grenade.

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.004
Well, that's not okay,
even though the results are the

00:36:46.004 --> 00:36:48.400
same.
What makes the difference?

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:52.935
Why is it morally legitimate
for Jones to throw himself on

00:36:52.935 --> 00:36:56.129
the grenade?
The only answer that I can see

00:36:56.129 --> 00:36:59.500
is, because he agrees to it.
He did it to himself;

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:03.639
he volunteered,
it has his consent.

00:37:03.639 --> 00:37:07.776
If we throw away the consent
principle, we're forced to say

00:37:07.776 --> 00:37:10.699
what Jones did isn't morally
admirable.

00:37:10.699 --> 00:37:14.810
It's morally appalling,
it's morally forbidden.

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:18.769
I can't believe that.
So, we need a consent principle.

00:37:18.769 --> 00:37:21.627
But on the other hand,
we don't want to go with such a

00:37:21.627 --> 00:37:23.730
strong consent principle that we
say,

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:26.891
oh, it's okay to kill crazy
people, or kill children,

00:37:26.891 --> 00:37:29.949
just because they say,
"Oh, kill me."

00:37:29.949 --> 00:37:34.240
So we need something--a more
moderate form of the consent

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:37.994
principle.
We need to say consent can do

00:37:37.994 --> 00:37:42.489
its thing, but only under
certain conditions.

00:37:42.489 --> 00:37:44.840
What exactly are the relevant
conditions?

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.267
Well, this is,
of course, one more topic open

00:37:48.267 --> 00:37:50.891
for debate.
We might insist that,

00:37:50.891 --> 00:37:54.650
look, the permission has got to
be given freely.

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:58.667
It's got to be given knowing
what the upshots are going to

00:37:58.667 --> 00:38:00.831
be.
It's got to be given by

00:38:00.831 --> 00:38:03.744
somebody who is sane,
who is rational,

00:38:03.744 --> 00:38:07.232
who is competent,
who's--and that may deal with

00:38:07.232 --> 00:38:10.531
the child case as well,
who is not yet competent to

00:38:10.531 --> 00:38:14.577
make this sort of decision.
There's room for disagreement

00:38:14.577 --> 00:38:18.641
about what exactly are the
relevant conditions to put into

00:38:18.641 --> 00:38:21.849
a proper version of the consent
principle.

00:38:21.849 --> 00:38:25.929
We might also want to throw in
some requirement that the person

00:38:25.929 --> 00:38:29.219
have good reasons for his giving
you permission.

00:38:29.219 --> 00:38:31.550
That might deal with the case
where you just come up to me

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:32.900
after class and say,
"Kill me."

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:36.064
I mean you're not insane.
Well, at least you might not be

00:38:36.064 --> 00:38:40.559
insane.
You know what's going to happen.

00:38:40.559 --> 00:38:42.672
In some sense,
you've reached the age of

00:38:42.672 --> 00:38:45.760
competence, but you don't have
any good reasons for it.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.909
Maybe that's enough to
undermine the force of consent.

00:38:48.909 --> 00:38:52.460
Well, suppose we've got some
kind of modified consent

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:55.282
principle.
What should we say about

00:38:55.282 --> 00:38:59.337
suicide then?
Well, it seems to me what we're

00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:04.179
led to is, once again,
a modest view about suicide.

00:39:04.179 --> 00:39:07.873
The mere fact that the person
killed themself won't show that

00:39:07.873 --> 00:39:10.090
it was morally legitimate
because,

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:13.009
of course, even though they've
given themself permission,

00:39:13.009 --> 00:39:15.236
they may not have had,
for example,

00:39:15.236 --> 00:39:18.329
good reason,
or they might be insane.

00:39:18.329 --> 00:39:21.719
But for all that,
if we can have cases--and I

00:39:21.719 --> 00:39:26.186
take it we can have
cases--where somebody rationally

00:39:26.186 --> 00:39:30.511
assesses their situation,
sees that they're better off

00:39:30.511 --> 00:39:34.469
dead, thinks the case through,
doesn't rush into it,

00:39:34.469 --> 00:39:38.784
makes an informed and voluntary
decision, with good reason

00:39:38.784 --> 00:39:43.402
behind it--in a situation like
that it seems to me the consent

00:39:43.402 --> 00:39:46.429
principle might well come into
play,

00:39:46.429 --> 00:39:50.654
in which case consent will
trump or nullify the force of

00:39:50.654 --> 00:39:55.570
the deontological prohibition
against harming innocent people.

00:39:55.570 --> 00:40:00.119
So, suicide will again be
acceptable in some cases,

00:40:00.119 --> 00:40:03.378
though not in all.
And that's the conclusion that

00:40:03.378 --> 00:40:05.920
seems to me to be the right one,
whether we accept the

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.989
utilitarian position or one of
these deontological positions.

00:40:08.989 --> 00:40:12.818
Suicide isn't always
legitimate, but it's

00:40:12.818 --> 00:40:17.822
sometimes legitimate.
It still leaves the question,

00:40:17.822 --> 00:40:21.499
what should we do when we see,
when we come across,

00:40:21.499 --> 00:40:24.219
somebody trying to kill
themself?"

00:40:24.219 --> 00:40:28.449
And there I think there is good
reason to ask yourself,

00:40:28.449 --> 00:40:32.366
are you confident that the
person has satisfied the

00:40:32.366 --> 00:40:35.500
conditions on the consent
principle?

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.165
Perhaps we should err on the
side of caution,

00:40:38.165 --> 00:40:41.679
and assume that the person may
be acting under distress,

00:40:41.679 --> 00:40:43.516
not thinking clearly,
not informed,

00:40:43.516 --> 00:40:46.540
not altogether competent,
not acting for good reasons.

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:56.142
But to accept that is not to
accept the stronger conclusion

00:40:56.142 --> 00:41:00.539
that we must never permit
somebody to kill themself.

00:41:00.539 --> 00:41:03.950
If we become convinced that
they have thought it through,

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:07.413
that they do have good reason,
that they are informed,

00:41:07.413 --> 00:41:10.769
that they are acting
voluntarily, in some such cases

00:41:10.769 --> 00:41:14.060
it may be legitimate for them to
kill themself,

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:21.300
and for us to let them.
All right, almost out of time.

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:26.083
So, let me shift gears for the
very last time,

00:41:26.083 --> 00:41:30.760
and take a quick look at where
we've been.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:34.960
At the start of the semester,
I invited you to think hard

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:39.610
about the nature of death or the
facts about life and death.

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:47.199
Most of us try very hard to not
think hard about death.

00:41:47.199 --> 00:41:51.464
It seems to be an unpleasant
topic, and we put it out of our

00:41:51.464 --> 00:41:53.502
mind.
We don't think about it,

00:41:53.502 --> 00:41:57.079
even when there's a sense in
which it's staring us in the

00:41:57.079 --> 00:41:59.686
face.
Every single class of this

00:41:59.686 --> 00:42:03.153
semester, every single day of
this semester,

00:42:03.153 --> 00:42:08.071
you've come into this building
and have walked past a cemetery

00:42:08.071 --> 00:42:12.949
right across the street.
How many times did you notice

00:42:12.949 --> 00:42:16.426
it?
How many times did you stop to

00:42:16.426 --> 00:42:22.574
think about the complete visual
reminder that we are on this

00:42:22.574 --> 00:42:27.679
Earth for a while,
and then we're not anymore?

00:42:27.679 --> 00:42:29.719
Most of us just don't think
about it.

00:42:29.719 --> 00:42:31.543
Well, of course you are,
in some sense,

00:42:31.543 --> 00:42:34.202
the exceptions.
You've spent a semester

00:42:34.202 --> 00:42:38.048
thinking about it,
and I'll be largely content if

00:42:38.048 --> 00:42:42.535
you've taken the opportunity
this semester to take a hard

00:42:42.535 --> 00:42:47.626
look at the things you believe.
Whether or not you ended up

00:42:47.626 --> 00:42:51.385
agreeing with me,
about the various claims that

00:42:51.385 --> 00:42:54.919
I've put forward,
is less important than that

00:42:54.919 --> 00:42:59.281
you've taken the chance to take
a hard look at your beliefs and

00:42:59.281 --> 00:43:03.361
asked yourself not just what you
hoped or wished or kind of

00:43:03.361 --> 00:43:08.119
believed was true,
but what you could actually

00:43:08.119 --> 00:43:10.648
defend.
Still, having said that,

00:43:10.648 --> 00:43:14.510
it would be disingenuous of me
to pretend that I don't also

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:18.638
hope that you've come around--if
you didn't start out believing

00:43:18.638 --> 00:43:22.501
what I believe--that you've come
around to believing what I

00:43:22.501 --> 00:43:25.714
believe.
As I pointed out on the first

00:43:25.714 --> 00:43:30.448
day, most people accept a great
deal of this package of beliefs

00:43:30.448 --> 00:43:33.349
about the nature of life and
death,

00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:36.789
that--They believe we have a
soul, that there's something

00:43:36.789 --> 00:43:40.880
more to us than our bodies.
And they believe that because

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:45.341
they think, given the existence
of a soul, we'll have the

00:43:45.341 --> 00:43:51.133
possibility of living forever.
Immortality is a possibility,

00:43:51.133 --> 00:43:57.351
and we all hope for and crave
the possibility that we will

00:43:57.351 --> 00:44:01.932
live forever because death is,
and must be,

00:44:01.932 --> 00:44:04.805
horrible.
It's so horrible that we try

00:44:04.805 --> 00:44:07.878
not to think about it.
It's so horrible that when we

00:44:07.878 --> 00:44:11.949
do think about it we're filled
with dread, terror and fear.

00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:16.397
And it's just obvious that
that's the only sensible

00:44:16.397 --> 00:44:20.400
reaction to the facts about life
and death.

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:24.773
Life is so incredible that
under no circumstances could it

00:44:24.773 --> 00:44:29.070
ever make sense to be glad that
it had come to an end.

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:33.732
Immortality would be desirable;
suicide could never be a

00:44:33.732 --> 00:44:38.059
reasonable response.
Over the course of this

00:44:38.059 --> 00:44:42.059
semester, I've argued that that
package of beliefs,

00:44:42.059 --> 00:44:44.619
common as it may be,
is mistaken,

00:44:44.619 --> 00:44:49.409
virtually from start to finish.
There is no soul,

00:44:49.409 --> 00:44:53.830
we are just machines.
We're not just any old machine;

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:58.158
we are amazing machines.
We are machines capable of

00:44:58.158 --> 00:45:02.081
loving, capable of dreaming,
capable of being creative,

00:45:02.081 --> 00:45:06.150
capable of making plans and
sharing them with others.

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:11.269
We are people.
But we're just machines anyway.

00:45:11.269 --> 00:45:16.530
And when the machine breaks,
that's the end.

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:23.015
Death is not some big mystery
which we can't get our heads

00:45:23.015 --> 00:45:26.239
around.
Death is in some sense no more

00:45:26.239 --> 00:45:29.980
mysterious than the fact that
your lamp can break,

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:35.870
or your computer can break,
or any other machine will

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:40.779
eventually fail.
I never meant to claim that

00:45:40.779 --> 00:45:45.880
it's not regrettable that we die
the way we do.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:50.872
As I argued when talking about
immortality, better still would

00:45:50.872 --> 00:45:55.865
be if only we had the prospect
of living as long as life still

00:45:55.865 --> 00:46:01.050
had something left to offer us.
As long as life would be good

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:04.889
overall, death is bad,
and I think for most of us

00:46:04.889 --> 00:46:08.165
death comes too soon.
But having said that,

00:46:08.165 --> 00:46:11.328
it doesn't follow that
immortality would be a good

00:46:11.328 --> 00:46:13.766
thing.
On the contrary,

00:46:13.766 --> 00:46:17.710
immortality would be a bad
thing.

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:21.914
The reaction that makes sense
in thinking about the facts of

00:46:21.914 --> 00:46:26.189
death is not to find it as some
great mystery too dreadful to

00:46:26.189 --> 00:46:29.159
think about,
too overwhelming.

00:46:29.159 --> 00:46:32.008
But rather, fear,
far from being the rationally

00:46:32.008 --> 00:46:35.414
appropriate response I think,
is an inappropriate

00:46:35.414 --> 00:46:38.798
response.
Although we can be sad that we

00:46:38.798 --> 00:46:42.581
die too soon,
that perhaps should be balanced

00:46:42.581 --> 00:46:47.997
by the fact of--the recognition
of--just how incredibly lucky we

00:46:47.997 --> 00:46:51.349
all are to have been alive at
all.

00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:55.740
Yet, at the same time,
recognizing that sense of luck

00:46:55.740 --> 00:47:00.891
and being fortunate doesn't mean
that we're always lucky to be

00:47:00.891 --> 00:47:04.724
remaining alive.
For some of us the time will

00:47:04.724 --> 00:47:09.472
come in which that's no longer
true, and when that happens life

00:47:09.472 --> 00:47:12.230
is not something to be held
onto,

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:14.472
come what may,
under any and all

00:47:14.472 --> 00:47:18.686
circumstances.
The time could come for some of

00:47:18.686 --> 00:47:24.308
us in which it's time to let go.
What I then invited you to do,

00:47:24.308 --> 00:47:28.413
over the course of the
semester, is not only to think

00:47:28.413 --> 00:47:32.360
for yourself about the facts of
life and death,

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:38.762
but I invite you all to come to
face death without fear and

00:47:38.762 --> 00:47:46.000
without illusion.
Thanks very much [applause].

00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.560
PROFESSOR: So, welcome to
Philosophy and the Science of

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.380
Human Nature.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.630
It's nice see so many
of you here today.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.149
I hope to see more of you
here again on Thursday.

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:14.910
And my goal today is to try to
give you a sense of what kind

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.940
of course this is going to be
so that you can make an

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.370
informed decision about whether
this is a course that

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.090
you actually want to enroll
in for credit.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.640
With that aim in mind, there are
three things I want to do

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.210
in today's lecture.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.960
In the first part of the
lecture, I'm just going to

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.345
give you a very broad overview
of what kind of course this

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:36.910
is, and to say a few words about
what my goals are for

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.150
the course.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.710
In the bulk of the lecture, what
I'm going to do is to run

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.750
through three examples of the
kinds of topics that we're

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.803
going to be addressing this
semester, so that you have a

00:00:47.803 --> 00:00:50.050
sense of what kind of
material we're going

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.190
to be talking about.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.400
And in the final section of
the course, I'll say a few

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.460
things about what it is that
makes this course distinctive,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.240
and a few things about the
course's requirements.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.705
So the course has this
perplexing cross-listed title.

00:01:03.705 --> 00:01:07.050
It's called Philosophy and the
Science of Human Nature, and

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.136
it's listed both in Philosophy
and in Cognitive Science, and

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.690
it's a course for which you
can get credit in the

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.160
Psychology major.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.620
So what kind of course
is this?

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.630
Well, in some ways, this is a
course like Directed Studies

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.830
Philosophy or Philosophy
125-126.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.865
That is, we're going to be
reading works by Plato, by

00:01:29.865 --> 00:01:36.793
Aristotle, by Epictetus, by
Boethius, by Hobbes, by Hume,

00:01:36.793 --> 00:01:38.550
and by Mill--

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.870
all major philosophers
from the Western

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.670
philosophical tradition.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.253
We're going to be reading them
roughly historically, with an

00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:49.740
attempt to get at some of the
kinds of questions that one

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.860
would get at in a traditional
philosophy course.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.802
In addition, you'll get some of
the material that you would

00:01:56.802 --> 00:01:59.740
get in an ethics course.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.540
So one of the topics that we'll
cover in Philosophy and

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.470
the Science of Human Nature
are the three main ethical

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.230
theories in the Western
philosophical tradition.

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.650
We'll talk about utilitarianism,
we'll talk

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.575
about deontology, and we'll talk
about virtue ethics, and

00:02:14.575 --> 00:02:18.270
we'll talk about how those
relate to one another.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.650
You'll also get some of the
materials that you would get

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.420
if you took an introduction to
political philosophy course.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.390
We'll very briefly look at the
work of Thomas Hobbes on the

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.610
legitimacy of the state, and
then we'll read and think

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.860
about the debate between John
Rawls and Robert Nozick about

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.260
how much weight should be given
to the relative values

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.100
of equality on one hand and
liberty on the other.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.710
So in that regard, this is,
in some ways, a standard

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.440
philosophy course in the moral
and political tradition.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.086
It's not a course in
metaphysics; it's not a course

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:55.860
in epistemology; it's not a
course where we're going to be

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.570
talking about issues like free
will or the mind-body problem,

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.500
all of which could legitimately
fall under the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.050
topic of philosophy
of human nature.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.750
But what's distinctive about
this course is that in

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.730
addition to the contributions
that are made by the

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.650
philosophical side of the
equation, we're also going to

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.630
be drawing from a number
of other disciplines.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.370
So one of the main themes of
the course will be to think

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.320
about how the questions raised
by the traditional

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.600
philosophers that I've mentioned
already are picked

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.060
up in the contemporary cognitive
science tradition.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.760
In particular, how they're
picked up by what I see as one

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.362
of the main strands in
contemporary cognitive

00:03:40.362 --> 00:03:44.240
science, the strand that looks
at the relation between human

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.020
beings as rational creatures,
capable of a certain kind of

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.220
calculated and reflective
understanding of themselves

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.820
and their place in the world,
and, on the other hand, human

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:03.160
beings as evolved animals who
are subject to forces that lie

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.870
beyond their rational control.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.410
In light of that recognition
that human beings are capable

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.180
of being affected in multiple
ways, we'll look at a number

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.330
of writings from psychology.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.020
So we'll read some Freud; we'll
have a discussion of

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.680
cognitive behavioral therapy;
we'll talk about

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.230
post-traumatic stress
disorder; we'll have

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.260
discussion of happiness, using
a wonderful book written by a

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.750
Yale alumnus, Jonathan Haidt.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.049
We'll look at some work on
self-regulation, on love and

00:04:38.049 --> 00:04:41.540
friendship, and we'll also
look at empirical work on

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.315
topics like moral reasoning
and punishment, and social

00:04:45.315 --> 00:04:49.096
psychological work on situations
and attitudes.

00:04:49.096 --> 00:04:51.920
So a lot of the material that
we'll address in this course

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.754
will come from psychology.

00:04:54.754 --> 00:04:57.620
But some of it will also come
from the tradition of

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.310
political science.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.770
So in the course of discussing
the legitimacy of the state,

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.190
we'll introduce ourselves
to the notion of

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.480
the prisoners' dilemma.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.365
We'll talk about the tragedy
of the commons, and in the

00:05:09.365 --> 00:05:12.650
closing section of the course,
we'll talk about the role of

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.080
rhetoric and argument in
political persuasion.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.980
We'll also draw from the field
of behavioral economics.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.970
One of the reading assignments
is to listen to Daniel

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.870
Kahneman's Nobel Prize speech,
accepting the Nobel Price on

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.920
behalf of himself and his
collaborator, Amos Tversky,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.870
for the extraordinary
work they did

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.330
founding behavioral economics.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.512
But we'll also look at some
additional work in the dual

00:05:39.512 --> 00:05:42.220
processing tradition, and we
have some excerpts from Dan

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.060
Ariely's delightful
book, public book

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.595
on behavioral economics.

00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:52.600
Finally, we'll even draw a
little bit from literature.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.440
We're going to read a short
excerpt from the Iliad; we're

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.830
going to read a short story by
Ursula LeGuin; and in the

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.070
second to last lecture of the
course, we'll look at what

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.740
Plato has to say about the
role of literature and

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.360
artistic representation
in affecting human

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.695
self-understanding.

00:06:12.695 --> 00:06:16.050
So what I'm going to try to do
in the course is to bring

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:22.360
together these eight fields in a
way that provides a coherent

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.970
story about what kind of things
human beings are, and

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.360
how we can learn about what kind
of things human beings

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.752
are from these various
perspectives.

00:06:32.752 --> 00:06:36.730
In slogan form, the structure
of the course is dead guy on

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.910
Tuesday, cog sci on Thursday.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.260
Except not all the philosophers

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.960
we're reading are dead.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.760
And not all of them are guys.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.010
And not all the other
fields are cog sci.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.385
And in fact, most things are
going to be covered together

00:06:49.385 --> 00:06:50.930
on Tuesday and Thursday.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.586
And there are going
to be sections.

00:06:52.586 --> 00:06:54.340
But other than that,
the slogan.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.162
So that's an overview of the
kinds of disciplines that

00:07:01.162 --> 00:07:02.850
contribute to the course.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.170
Let me say a bit about the
specific topics that I hope to

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.750
address in the course
of the semester.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.670
So the first overarching topic,
and I roughly organized

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.995
the syllabus under these three
topics, but in some way, each

00:07:17.995 --> 00:07:20.638
of them will keep re-emerging
throughout the semester.

00:07:20.638 --> 00:07:24.630
The first topic is the topic of
happiness and flourishing.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.150
What does the ancient Western
philosophical tradition say

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.260
about what it takes for human
beings to thrive in a

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:38.400
meaningful sense, and how does
that connect to work that's

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.560
been done more recently in
various literary and

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.870
scientific traditions about what
it is that enables human

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.750
beings to flourish?

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:55.230
What is it about human nature
that can give us some clue

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.836
about what kind of thing
authentic happiness might be?

00:07:59.836 --> 00:08:04.030
That's the first set of
questions that we'll address.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.420
It turns out that the ancient
philosophers' answer to that

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.080
question is that human beings
thrive when their souls are

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.250
well-ordered, to use the
ancient metaphor.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.740
When the parts of their souls
that might pull in different

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.837
directions are in a certain
kind of harmony; and the

00:08:22.837 --> 00:08:26.300
ancient picture is that when
that happens, human beings

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.750
behave in a moral way.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:35.070
And so the second part of the
course will look at both what

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.570
it feels like from the inside
to behave in ways that are

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:42.510
conventionally considered
moral, and from a higher

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:48.420
level, what it is that we mean
when we say that an act is

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.510
moral or immoral.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:53.880
So as I mentioned, we'll look
at the three main Western

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.610
philosophical conceptions of
morality, and we'll also look

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.860
at some interesting
related questions.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:05.500
Like, why is punishment
justified when it is?

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.430
And is the justification
for punishment

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.800
psychological or ethical?

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.340
And in the final unit of the
course, we'll move beyond the

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:20.640
individual into society as a
whole, and ask some questions

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.600
about what it is that makes
political structures

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:30.090
legitimate, and how it is that
state or civic institutions

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.820
ought to be organized
in order to allow

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.440
human beings to flourish.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.350
So those are the three main
topics that we'll be

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.690
addressing, and as you can see,
on the syllabus that I've

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:46.130
handed out, there are
highlighted examples of a few

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.960
of those particular topics that
we're addressing on page

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.300
one of the syllabus, and a
much more detailed set of

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:57.180
questions on pages
three and four.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.190
But in addition to being about
the content of these

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:05.200
questions, this is also a
course that's going to

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.380
encourage you to think about the
methodology of each of the

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.530
disciplines from which
we're drawing.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:17.236
So it's my goal to introduce you
to a number of traditional

00:10:17.236 --> 00:10:21.025
philosophical discussions of the
human being, but it's also

00:10:21.025 --> 00:10:25.760
my goal to get you to think
about what these philosophical

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.070
discussions have in common, and
why it is that thinking

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:34.370
about things in the way that
philosophy thinks about things

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:40.270
can be valuable for answering
questions that we care about.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.636
And we'll do something very
similar with respect to the

00:10:43.636 --> 00:10:44.990
other disciplines.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.650
We'll look at the literature
from psychology and behavioral

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.931
economics and political science
and literature, and

00:10:52.931 --> 00:10:56.688
we'll ask: what is it about this
distinctive approach to

00:10:56.688 --> 00:11:01.190
answering these questions
that provides us with a

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:06.040
complementary insight on the
issues that the philosophers

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.552
have raised?

00:11:07.552 --> 00:11:11.610
And finally, I'm going to ask
you to think not only in the

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.120
context of this class, but in
the context of the other

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.800
classes you're taking about the
ways in which the material

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:24.660
to which you're being exposed
sheds light through multiple

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.528
disciplinary perspectives on
the set of questions that

00:11:28.528 --> 00:11:30.480
we're concerned with.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.980
So that's the opening segment
of the lecture.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:37.215
That what I had called the
"overview and course topics"

00:11:37.215 --> 00:11:38.430
section of the class.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:42.787
And what I want to do now is to
give you three examples of

00:11:42.787 --> 00:11:48.596
the kinds of topics that we'll
be addressing this semester.

00:11:48.596 --> 00:11:53.030
So the first example I'm going
to give is actually drawn from

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:56.330
the readings that we'll
be doing for Thursday.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:00.595
And it's a story from Plato's
Republic called the story of

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:02.570
the ring of Gyges.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.860
I'll give you a little bit more
background on Thursday

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.710
about where this story fits in
the context of the book from

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.930
which it's drawn, but for now,
all you need to know is that

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:17.140
there's a character named
Glaucon who's actually one of

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.620
the brothers of Plato, the
author of this dialogue.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.290
And Glaucon is in conversation
with the great ancient Greek

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:28.510
philosopher Socrates, and he's
trying to convince Socrates

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.931
that when people act morally,
the only reason they do it is

00:12:31.931 --> 00:12:33.920
because they can't
get away with it.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.368
So even if you've shopped only
for today, you'll have a

00:12:37.368 --> 00:12:39.680
chance to hear some Plato.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.510
So I'm going to read
aloud to you these

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.940
numbers on the right.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.070
I'll explain to you next
class, they're called

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.460
Stephanus numbers.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.200
They enable you, whichever
translation of Plato you're

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.130
using to find the
same passage.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.420
And what I'm reading to you from
is from Stephanus pages

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.599
359 to 360.

00:12:58.599 --> 00:12:59.980
So:

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.099
"There was once a shepherd named
Gyges in the service of

00:13:04.099 --> 00:13:06.510
the ruler of Lydia.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.980
There was a giant thunderstorm,
and an

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:13.394
earthquake broke open the ground
and created a chasm at

00:13:13.394 --> 00:13:15.970
the place where he was
tending his sheep.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.400
Seeing this, he was filled
with amazement and

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.640
went down into it.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:29.710
And there he saw a hollow
bronze horse.

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.610
There were window-like openings
in it, and peeking

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:36.017
in, he saw a corpse wearing
nothing but a

00:13:36.017 --> 00:13:38.830
gold ring on his finger.

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:46.430
So he took the ring and came
out of the chasm."

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:50.484
"He wore the ring at his usual
monthly meeting that reported

00:13:50.484 --> 00:13:53.360
to the king on the state
of the flocks.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.510
And as he was sitting among
the others, he happened to

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:57.793
turn the setting of the ring
towards himself, to the inside

00:13:57.793 --> 00:13:58.761
of the hand.

00:13:58.761 --> 00:14:01.650
And when he did this, he became
invisible to those

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:03.640
sitting near him, and
they went on talking

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.330
as if he had gone.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.410
He wondered about this, and
fingering the ring, he turned

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:11.630
the setting outwards again,
and became visible.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.430
So he experimented with the ring
to test whether it indeed

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.625
had this power, and it did.

00:14:15.625 --> 00:14:18.860
If he turned the setting inward,
he became invisible,

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.430
and if he turned it outward,
he became visible again."

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:25.700
"When he realized this, he
arranged to become one of the

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.800
messengers sent to report
to the king.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:33.810
And when he arrived there, he
seduced the king's wife, with

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:39.186
her help, attacked and killed
the king, and took over the

00:14:39.186 --> 00:14:40.420
kingdom."

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:45.040
So that's the story of
the ring of Gyges.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.910
Now why is it that Glaucon
tells that story?

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:55.746
Glaucon tells that story with
the expectation that you, upon

00:14:55.746 --> 00:15:01.480
hearing this, will think that
you would act as Gyges did, if

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:07.210
you had the opportunity
to get away with crime

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.190
without being caught.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:13.590
Glaucon's conclusion from this
story is that those who

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:16.620
practice justice, those who
act in conformity with the

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:21.610
moral code of their society,
do so because they lack the

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.310
power to do injustice.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:28.080
They act in that way because
they fear the

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.320
punishment of society.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.480
They don't act in that way
because it's in any way

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.270
valuable to them.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.040
And the reading that we're
going to do for this

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:44.580
Thursday's class includes both
the text that surrounds the

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.310
story that I just told you.

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:49.800
So the setup wherein Glaucon
raises the challenge of which

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.760
this is supposed to be an
example, and the conversation

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.410
between Glaucon and Socrates
that follows the posing of the

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:58.770
challenge through this story.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.460
And in addition, we're going
to read some empirical

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:07.150
psychological work on the
question of what people do

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.710
when they think they
are unobserved.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:13.620
So we're going to ask the
question whether, as a matter

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:18.210
of fact, people would, and
whether, as a matter of fact,

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:23.306
people should behave
as Gyges did.

00:16:23.306 --> 00:16:26.585
That's the first example of the
kind of topic we're going

00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:30.060
to address in the course.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.890
A second set of topics that
we'll address in the course

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:36.960
will take off from a particular
philosophical

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.500
example that has become quite
popular in contemporary

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.550
discussions of morality, but
which is actually traceable,

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:49.080
about 40 years old, to some
writings by Philippa Foot, and

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.490
the philosopher Judith
Thomson.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.826
And the case, with which I
suspect some of you are

00:16:53.826 --> 00:16:58.090
familiar, involves a trolley
which is hurtling down the

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:03.730
track in the direction of five
people, and if the trolley is

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:08.360
not turned, it will hit
this group of five.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.600
Now, the question that
philosophers like to pose is

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.010
the following.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:19.110
Suppose that there were a switch
which you could use

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:23.628
that would divert the trolley so
that instead of hitting the

00:17:23.628 --> 00:17:30.010
five people, it would go down
a branch track and hit one.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:32.222
When we have our course
clickers, we'll be able to do

00:17:32.222 --> 00:17:33.210
this scientifically.

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.730
For now, I just want
a show of hands.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.920
How many people think it is
either morally permitted or

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.750
morally required, that is,
either permitted or required,

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:47.050
not forbidden, to switch the
trolley in such a way that it

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:50.260
hits the one person, rather
than the five?

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.650
How many think it's either
permitted or required to

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:58.420
switch the trolley so that one
person dies rather than five?

00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:58.485
[pause]

00:17:58.485 --> 00:17:58.550
OK.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:01.890
And how many of you think it's
morally forbidden to turn the

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.860
trolley so that it kills one
person rather than five?

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.815
How many of you think it's
morally forbidden, prohibited?

00:18:06.815 --> 00:18:08.280
[pause]

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.080
OK.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:13.080
So as I said, we don't have
the clickers, but a vast

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.015
majority of the class believes
that it's either permitted or

00:18:17.015 --> 00:18:19.590
required to divert
the trolley.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:25.420
Now, suppose we had a slightly
different situation.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:29.960
Instead of the one person being
on the tracks, there is,

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:35.980
rather, a bridge that rests
over the trolley tracks.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:43.970
And atop the bridge, a large
gentleman of ample girth such

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:50.940
that were you to dislodge him
from his present location

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:56.240
using the same switch that you
used in the last case, he

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:00.420
would be sufficiently weighty
to prevent the trolley from

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.660
hitting the five.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.193
How many of you think it is
morally required or morally

00:19:06.193 --> 00:19:12.197
permitted to push the fat man
off the bridge to prevent the

00:19:12.197 --> 00:19:13.565
trolley from hitting the five?

00:19:13.565 --> 00:19:16.950
[pause]

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.720
And how many of you think it
is morally prohibited?

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:23.910
Hands up again?

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:24.540
[pause]

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:24.850
All right.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:29.565
We have a very, very different
spread this time.

00:19:29.565 --> 00:19:35.660
Now suppose we end up at the
hospital, and the five who

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.370
were lying on the track when
the trolley didn't hit them

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:42.412
are terribly injured in such a
way that one needs a heart,

00:19:42.412 --> 00:19:45.720
one needs a lung, one needs a
leg, one needs an arm, one

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.130
needs an eye.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:53.815
And in walks a healthy gentlemen
with exactly the

00:19:53.815 --> 00:19:58.218
organs required to
save the five.

00:19:58.218 --> 00:20:02.050
How many of you think it is
morally required or morally

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.795
permitted to cut up the
one to save the five?

00:20:05.795 --> 00:20:10.280
[pause]

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.820
I won't sit with you in the
hospital waiting room.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.780
That was three hands.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.330
How many of you think it
is morally prohibited?

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:17.900
[pause]

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.220
All right.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.635
Suppose there is a bear
running towards you.

00:20:23.635 --> 00:20:26.190
You're standing in line of
people, and there's a bear

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.220
running towards you.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.880
How many of you think it's
morally permitted to move out

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.040
of the bear's way if the bear
is running towards you?

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:35.290
[pause]

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:37.110
OK.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.730
Now when that happens, the
bear's going to eat the guy

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.640
who is right behind you.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:41.976
OK.

00:20:41.976 --> 00:20:44.000
Case number two.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.190
Suppose there's a bear
running towards you.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:51.525
How many of you think it's
morally permitted to reach

00:20:51.525 --> 00:20:56.115
behind you, and take that guy
and put him in front of you to

00:20:56.115 --> 00:20:57.240
shield you from the bear?

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.980
[pause]

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:05.210
Very different distribution
of hands.

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:05.880
OK.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.310
What's going on here?

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:12.480
In the original switch case
where we turn the trolley, one

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.930
person's going to die if we turn
the trolley, and five are

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:16.440
going to live.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.380
In the push the fat man case,
if we push the fat man, one

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.470
person's going to die, and five
people are going to live.

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:28.770
In the patient in the hospital
case, we bring him into the

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.500
hospital and cut him up.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.740
One person's going to die, and
five people are going to live.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.620
In the bear case, when you
duck, and he gets the guy

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:42.030
behind you, the guy behind
you dies, and you live.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:45.010
In the bear case, where you take
the guy behind you, put

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:48.555
him in front of you, and use
him as a shield, the guy

00:21:48.555 --> 00:21:52.460
behind you dies and you live.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:56.410
So the second set of topics that
I want to let you know

00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:00.840
we'll be talking about is the
following; What is it that

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:06.760
explains the differences in our
reactions to these cases?

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:12.940
Is there genuinely a morally
relevant difference between

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.020
diverting the trolley so that
it kills the one rather than

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:20.390
the five, and pushing the fat
man, so the trolley kills the

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:23.660
one rather than the five?

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:27.040
Or is the difference in our
reaction to those two cases

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.790
merely psychological?

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:33.745
Is there really a moral
difference between ducking in

00:22:33.745 --> 00:22:37.120
such a way that a harm that was
heading towards you hit

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.610
somebody else instead, and
shields you, so that a harm

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:45.350
that is heading towards
you is visited upon

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.290
someone else instead?

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:51.442
What is it that explains the
differences in our reactions

00:22:51.442 --> 00:22:53.060
in these cases?

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.430
What moral implications does
that have, and what

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.352
psychological implications
does that have?

00:22:59.352 --> 00:23:03.300
So that's the second set of
examples that I want to give

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:07.824
you, a topic that we'll
be addressing.

00:23:07.824 --> 00:23:10.974
Third set of examples.

00:23:10.974 --> 00:23:13.380
I imagine some of you
are familiar with

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.674
the following situation.

00:23:15.674 --> 00:23:22.380
You go to the library intending
sincerely to read

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.166
the Plato that has been assigned
to you for the next

00:23:25.166 --> 00:23:32.060
lecture and you find yourself,
instead, answering e-mails.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:36.482
Or you set for yourself a
dietary regimen, according to

00:23:36.482 --> 00:23:40.060
which you will eat large
amounts of fruit and

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:48.180
vegetables, and instead you find
yourself tempted by cake.

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:52.270
Or you commit yourself to saving
up money for some sort

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:56.594
of long-term goal, and instead,
find yourself

00:23:56.594 --> 00:24:02.270
distracted by the prospects of
March break in Jamaica with

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:09.790
your roommate, or an iPod touch,
or a new PlayStation 2

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:11.945
device that you can
use to distract

00:24:11.945 --> 00:24:15.478
yourself from your reading.

00:24:15.478 --> 00:24:21.156
So what is it about human beings
that we can form these

00:24:21.156 --> 00:24:27.515
sorts of plans, and then
not act on them?

00:24:27.515 --> 00:24:34.400
And what is it that we can do
to make ourselves stick to

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:40.670
commitments that we've made
in moments of reflection?

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:45.800
So the reading that I assigned
to you for today is a very,

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.700
very brief chapter from Dan
Ariely's popular book.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.220
It's a chapter on
procrastination.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:57.370
And in it, he describes a number
of strategies that we

00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:01.420
can use to help ourselves
stick to long-term

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.320
commitments.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.590
So, for example, one of the
things that people do if they

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:10.179
want to get themselves to read
is that they go to the

00:25:10.179 --> 00:25:13.610
library, and they surround
themselves by other people who

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:15.210
are reading.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:19.650
If you are in a social setting
where other people are

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:22.886
conforming to a standard that
you had set for yourself to

00:25:22.886 --> 00:25:27.396
conform to, you may find
yourself conforming to that

00:25:27.396 --> 00:25:30.720
standard, and not doing
that which you

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.260
will ultimately regret.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:38.530
If you find yourself incredibly
tempted by food

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:43.090
that you have prohibited to
yourself, it may be helpful to

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:46.550
limit your access to it.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:49.555
In the chapter that we read,
Dan Ariely describes an

00:25:49.555 --> 00:25:54.280
example of what he called the
iced credit card solution,

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.350
where, if you have a tendency
to make impulse purchases on

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:01.270
the Internet, you take your
credit card, and you put it in

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:04.750
a glass of water, which you
put into the freezer.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:07.650
And then, if you want to buy
something, you remove the

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:10.622
credit card from the freezer,
and if, when the water has

00:26:10.622 --> 00:26:15.266
melted, you still want to
buy it, then go ahead.

00:26:15.266 --> 00:26:20.166
So restricting our immediate
access to items that are

00:26:20.166 --> 00:26:25.280
tempting is a way of getting
around the problem.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.600
A third way of getting around
these sorts of problems

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.080
involves automatizing
the behavior

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.330
that you wish to encourage.

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:38.964
So if I set up a system on my
credit card where every time I

00:26:38.964 --> 00:26:44.930
spend $10 an additional $10 goes
into my savings account,

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:51.935
it will turn out that rather
than spending my money on that

00:26:51.935 --> 00:26:55.833
which I will buy, I will save
the money for that to which I

00:26:55.833 --> 00:26:57.083
am committed.

00:26:58.676 --> 00:27:01.110
So the philosophical and
psychological question that

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:07.165
this part of the course raises
is the following: What sort of

00:27:07.165 --> 00:27:11.906
beings are there that are
capable, simultaneously, of

00:27:11.906 --> 00:27:17.300
planning reflectively and of
not acting on the basis of

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.548
their plan?

00:27:19.548 --> 00:27:22.840
It looks an awful lot like
exactly the sort of people

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.530
that we were getting information
about in our

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:27.930
previous two examples.

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:31.455
They're the kind of beings who
have a reflective self, which

00:27:31.455 --> 00:27:35.552
is capable of reason and
commitment, and also aspects

00:27:35.552 --> 00:27:40.810
of their selves that respond
non-reflectively to features

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:43.230
in the environment.

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:48.482
So given that, what sorts of
strategies are available to

00:27:48.482 --> 00:27:52.980
help these kinds of beings stick
to their reflectively

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.230
endorsed plans?

00:27:56.710 --> 00:28:01.000
The basic answer is that there
are two kinds of strategies.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.820
One kind of strategy involves
increasing the relative

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:09.990
utility of the reflective
commitment, that is, making it

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:14.210
more salient to you in
whatever kind of way.

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:20.030
That reading and broccoli and
piggy banks are valuable.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:25.910
And the other sort of strategy
involves reducing the appeal

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:31.900
of the temporarily tempting
strategy: reducing access to

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:36.980
e-mail, reducing access
to the food, making it

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.530
harder to take the trip.

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:43.265
So one of the things that
we'll talk about in the

00:28:43.265 --> 00:28:49.860
context of the course, both in
small ways and in large ways,

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:54.450
is this fulcrum point of
procrastination as a way of

00:28:54.450 --> 00:29:02.630
understanding a large number
of social structures: laws,

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:07.750
moral codes, punishments,
strategies for

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:09.410
self-regulation.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:16.930
All of these are aspects of
society that play off of the

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:20.260
two fundamental strategies
just described.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:24.720
They play off of how it is that
either we make certain

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:29.080
things that we reflectively
endorse more valuable, or how

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:32.890
we make certain things that
we wish not to pursue less

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:35.340
acceptable.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:40.330
So that's the third example of
the kind of topic that we'll

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:45.240
be talking about
this semester.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.580
So what I want to do in the
final few minutes of the

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.730
course is to say a little bit
about some distinctive

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:55.775
features of the class.

00:29:55.775 --> 00:29:59.575
So the first thing, as some of
you may have noticed, is that

00:29:59.575 --> 00:30:03.600
very inconspicuously, in the
back of our room, is a

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.969
videographer.

00:30:04.969 --> 00:30:07.940
And the videographer in the
back of our room is here

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:14.320
because this class is being
videotaped for the Open Yale

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.100
Courses network.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:21.316
That means that there is a
change that your voice will be

00:30:21.316 --> 00:30:23.380
captured on audiotape.

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:27.123
And if that happens, we'll need
to obtain your permission

00:30:27.123 --> 00:30:32.670
to reproduce your voice on the
iTunes University version of

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:33.590
this class.

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:36.040
But it's also your chance for
fame and fortune, dudes.

00:30:38.659 --> 00:30:42.010
It's my hope that the fact that
this course is with Open

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:45.420
Yale Courses will be as
unobtrusive as possible, but

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.529
if any of you have any concerns
about it, please feel

00:30:48.529 --> 00:30:50.408
free to be in touch.

00:30:50.408 --> 00:30:53.100
The second, and I think more
important thing, that's

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.330
distinctive about this course,
is that this course is, in

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:59.392
some ways, about itself.

00:30:59.392 --> 00:31:03.925
The pedagogical features of this
course are designed with

00:31:03.925 --> 00:31:07.625
the fundamental insight
that underlies all of

00:31:07.625 --> 00:31:09.390
the readings in mind.

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:14.930
What I am assuming is that on
reflection, all of you are

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:19.370
committed to reading, and
learning, and engaging with

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:21.010
the material.

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:27.190
And my goal is to make that
as easy and exciting and

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:30.520
interesting for you
as possible.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.690
So as you've noticed from the
syllabus, those of you who

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:38.440
have had a chance to look at
it, there are almost weekly

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.330
assignments in this class.

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:44.740
But the weekly assignments are
designed to make you want to

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:48.100
engage with the material.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:51.190
So, for example, the very first
assignment for this

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:55.550
course, which is described on
the back page of the blue

00:31:55.550 --> 00:32:05.080
handout, asks you to think
about whether you want to

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:12.300
commit yourself, voluntarily, to
not having Internet access

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:18.670
during this class, and then to
explain your decision, making

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:22.125
reference to the work on
procrastination that we read

00:32:22.125 --> 00:32:24.330
for this week.

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:28.710
Throughout the semester, my goal
will be to make exercises

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:31.240
that engage you in that way.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.760
One of the exercises involves
writing a review of a short

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.550
story that we read from the
perspective of one of the two

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:41.680
philosophers that we've read.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:46.820
One of the assignments involves
designing a week of a

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.380
future version of this course.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:54.160
So though there are ten weekly
assignments, it's my hope that

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.850
engaging in those assignments
will keep you

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:59.390
connected to the course.

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:04.090
In fact, a number of the
readings on the syllabus that

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:07.920
appears before you were
suggestions made by students

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.185
who took the seminar
version of this

00:33:10.185 --> 00:33:12.880
course in previous years.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:18.798
In addition, as you saw from the
trolley cases, I'm going

00:33:18.798 --> 00:33:23.490
to be asking you, in the context
of class, to think

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:25.840
about cases and examples.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.820
And in doing that, it's been
found that making use of

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:34.372
clickers is enormously helpful
to keep students engaged.

00:33:34.372 --> 00:33:37.030
So you'll notice that the second
part of next week's

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:41.992
assignment asks you, if you're
enrolled in the course for

00:33:41.992 --> 00:33:46.030
credit, to pick up a clicker
at the Bass Library, and to

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:50.160
register its number on
the course website.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.370
So once the course gets going,
starting in the middle of the

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:56.750
second week, we'll be making
use of clickers.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:00.410
Finally, one of the things
that makes this course

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:05.290
distinctive is that I actually
spent last year, as the Yale

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:10.040
Daily News reports, as
a full-time student.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.630
I had a grant from the Mellon
Foundation that allowed me to

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:17.000
take classes, and so I spent
most of last year sitting in

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.350
the back row of classrooms like
this one, listening to

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:22.670
lectures like this one.

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:26.200
Which is how I got the idea
about the turning off the

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:26.960
Internet thing.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.210
Ahem.

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:33.840
But it also helped me realize
that the rhythm of the

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.420
semester is a complicated one.

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.950
So as you'll see, the second
sentence of the Yale Daily

00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:43.010
News article notes, "Her
grades lately have been

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:46.000
sliding a little -- from an
'excellent' on the first two

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.090
assignments to only a
'checkmark' for completion on

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:51.780
the most recent two."

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:56.500
I promise I will not post your
grades in the Yale Daily News.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:00.620
But I promise that I am, as a
result of that experience,

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:04.520
profoundly aware of the ways
in which structuring

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:08.500
assignments with enough advance
notice is crucial for

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.750
allowing students to succeed
in the class.

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:16.170
So I've tried to be incredibly
explicit on the syllabus.

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:22.210
And if you look at pages four
and five of the syllabus,

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:25.230
you'll see that there
are five kinds of

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:28.350
requirements for the course.

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:31.704
The first and perhaps the most
important requirement of the

00:35:31.704 --> 00:35:37.010
course are the set of readings
that I have assigned you.

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:42.825
And these readings come in two
forms. Roughly half of them

00:35:42.825 --> 00:35:47.480
come from the six books which I
have ordered on your behalf

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.190
from Labyrinth Books.

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:52.670
All of the books are low-priced
student editions.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:56.170
All of them are easily available
in used form.

00:35:56.170 --> 00:36:00.460
And together, even purchased
new at full price,

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.310
they add up to $80.

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:06.360
So some of the assignments come
either from the three

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:10.562
classical works that we'll be
reading, Plato, Aristotle, and

00:36:10.562 --> 00:36:13.760
Epictetus, the two contemporary
works that we're

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.185
looking at, Jonathan Haidt's
Happiness Hypothesis, and a

00:36:17.185 --> 00:36:20.745
book by Jonathan Shea called
Achilles in Vietnam, and

00:36:20.745 --> 00:36:24.350
finally, I've asked you to
purchase a small $15

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:28.120
philosophy dictionary, which
is enormously useful for

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:32.290
looking up terms and concepts
with which you might be

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.190
unfamiliar.

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:36.890
I realize, however, that some
of you aren't going to have

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:38.250
decided whether you're
taking the

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.550
course before this Thursday.

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:45.280
And so even though half of
Thursday's reading comes from

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.800
this book, I have put up the
relevant pages on our

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.210
Classes*v2 server.

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:55.410
So you can do the reading for
Thursday, even if you haven't

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:57.030
purchased the book.

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:59.460
So roughly half the readings
come from those books.

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:02.740
Roughly half the readings come
from articles, and all of

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:06.900
those readings are available
on the *v2

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.490
server for next class.

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:12.560
But in addition to choosing
books that I think are

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:16.350
acceptable and interesting, I've
also made an effort to

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:19.900
provide you with reading guides
to the books in a way

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:22.220
that will orient you in them.

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:25.360
So if you look at the first
three pages of the blue

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:29.570
handout, you will see an example
of a reading guide,

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:31.300
and not just an example of
a reading guide, it's the

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:34.840
reading guide for the
reading on Thursday.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.952
And you'll see that it
does three things.

00:37:36.952 --> 00:37:38.707
The first thing that it does,
is it gives you a bit of

00:37:38.707 --> 00:37:42.982
background about the author that
we're reading, and the

00:37:42.982 --> 00:37:46.190
text from which we're
doing the reading.

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:49.002
The second thing that it does,
is that it highlights the

00:37:49.002 --> 00:37:52.907
terms and concepts which I'm
hoping that you will get out

00:37:52.907 --> 00:37:55.230
of the material.

00:37:55.230 --> 00:38:00.275
Notions and terms that will
enable you to express thoughts

00:38:00.275 --> 00:38:02.660
that you might have had, and the
vocabulary that will let

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:06.120
you be in conversation
with others.

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:09.220
And the final thing that the
reading guide has are a set of

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.555
questions to focus
your attention

00:38:11.555 --> 00:38:13.510
as you do the reading.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:15.100
There's no requirement
that you write

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:15.970
out answers to these.

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:18.880
You can use them to make notes
for yourselves, you can use

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.140
them in conversation with
your classmates.

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:24.630
But you will have, for every one
of the required readings,

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:27.860
this amount of guidance, and
for each of the recommended

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:33.190
and optional readings,
information about the author.

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:35.340
Second important thing
about the course

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:39.450
is lecture and sections.

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:44.270
I really like seeing all these
faces, and I really would love

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:46.430
to see them all semester long.

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:50.420
I promise to give you at least
one fun slide, and probably

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.450
more, per lecture.

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:56.960
So I really hope you'll come,
'cause when I post the slides,

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.920
you can't see the animation
of the nice shepherd.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:05.240
So I will try to make lectures
as engaging as possible, and

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.720
likewise with sections.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:10.820
We will make an effort to make
these settings where you can

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:14.430
genuinely engage with the
material and with one another.

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:18.290
It has been pointed out to me
that one of the section times

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:22.185
available is Thursdays from
10:30 to 11:20, which is, of

00:39:22.185 --> 00:39:24.190
course, when the
lecture meets.

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:27.340
Obviously that's a typographical
error, and we'll

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:31.900
be adding additional section
times to make up for that.

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.330
Section registration happens
in the usual way.

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:38.310
There will, in addition, be ten
brief directed exercises.

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:40.380
I've already said a bit to you
about them, and there's

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:44.380
information on the syllabus
about what point values those

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:47.370
have in determining
your final grades.

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:49.180
There are two short essays.

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:52.130
There will be three assigned,
and you can choose which two

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:53.933
of those you like.

00:39:53.933 --> 00:39:58.360
And finally, there will be a
final exam where, in keeping

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:03.420
with the theory of the course, I
will distribute every single

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:07.890
one of the questions that may
appear on the exam in advance.

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:11.830
I will encourage you to learn
that material in a focused and

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:13.190
structured way.

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:18.460
And the exam will consist of
a proper subset of those

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:23.040
questions which you have been
given to prepare in advance.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:27.520
So that's an overview of what
I plan to do this semester,

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:31.710
first of what kind of course
this is, second, three

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:35.020
examples of topics that we're
going to address, third, some

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.132
of the things that are
distinctive about the course

00:40:37.132 --> 00:40:38.650
and some of its requirements.

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:41.758
So what questions do you have?

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:47.400
Yeah?

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:50.000
STUDENT: [inaudible]

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.965
PROFESSOR: So the question is,
are the videos for the

00:40:51.965 --> 00:40:53.350
lectures going to be posted?

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:56.360
And the answer is, the videos
for the lectures take time to

00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:00.280
be edited and processed, so they
will be posted, but they

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.010
won't be posted during
the class.

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:07.010
I will post the slides after
each lecture, but as you saw

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:11.340
today, the slides don't give
you that much information.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.063
Yes?

00:41:12.063 --> 00:41:18.350
STUDENT: [inaudible]

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:18.840
PROFESSOR: No.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:22.610
Everything in the course is done
electronically; so all

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:25.330
assignments for the course are
to be submitted on the

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:28.776
Classes*v2 server under
assignments.

00:41:28.776 --> 00:41:32.628
And the deadline for the first
written exercise is actually

00:41:32.628 --> 00:41:35.380
next Tuesday at 10 AM, but
because that's still during

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:38.580
shopping period, that exercise
will be accepted without

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.640
penalty until Friday.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:43.650
But everything for the class,
in terms of submission and

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:47.830
return of exercises, will be
done online on our *v2 site.

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:48.100
Yeah?

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.230
STUDENT: When are sections
going to start?

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:51.820
PROFESSOR: When are sections
going to start?

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:55.940
Sections will begin the third
week of the semester.

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:56.140
Yeah?

00:41:56.140 --> 00:42:04.720
STUDENT: [inaudible]

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:05.210
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:08.020
So if you look at the sample
directed exercise which I gave

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:10.020
you, which is on the back
side of the blue sheet.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:13.190
So the question is, it says that
directed exercises are 1%

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:14.640
to 7% each, will I tell
you how much a

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.930
directed exercise is worth?

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:16.602
Answer, yes.

00:42:16.602 --> 00:42:19.440
So if you turn over the blue
sheet on the back, you'll see

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.755
that the directed exercise for
next week has two parts.

00:42:21.755 --> 00:42:24.220
One, take out a clicker;
that's worth one point.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.370
Two, tell me whether you're
going to turn off your

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:29.020
Internet and why.

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:29.870
Briefly.

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:33.390
So the directed exercise will
always say: here's the

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:35.222
question, here's the point
value for the question.

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:42.302
Anything else?

00:42:42.302 --> 00:42:43.600
We're actually at
the end of time!

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.460
So you all have paced your
questions extraordinarily

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.750
well, and I look forward to
seeing you next class.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.452
Professor Amy
Hungerford:

00:00:03.452 --> 00:00:06.339
So, today we find ourselves in
a very different novelistic

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:09.023
world than we've been in for the
last week and a half:

00:00:09.023 --> 00:00:12.454
On the Road.
Did anyone take this course

00:00:12.454 --> 00:00:15.500
because they love On the
Road?

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.340
Anybody?
One, sort of ambivalently.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.962
Yes.
Okay.

00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:24.316
Sometimes I do get students who
have just an image of this novel

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:27.502
in their mind,
or they read it when they were

00:00:27.502 --> 00:00:30.480
in high school and have a sort
of irrational,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.284
passionate love for it.
And so, sometimes people

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:38.467
approach it in that way,
and I think in a way it holds

00:00:38.467 --> 00:00:43.123
that aura around itself in our
culture and in the history of

00:00:43.123 --> 00:00:47.780
the novel in this period that
we're studying together.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.629
I'm going to talk a little bit
about its publishing history,

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.232
its compositional history,
actually, at the end of my two

00:00:57.232 --> 00:01:00.954
lectures on the novel.
So, I would ask you just to

00:01:00.954 --> 00:01:03.770
reserve whatever curiosity you
have about that.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.659
So, in a way,
I'm flipping my usual practice;

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.195
I would tell you a little bit
about its publication history at

00:01:09.195 --> 00:01:12.706
the beginning.
I'm going to do that at the end

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:16.562
for this reason:
that it has such a special

00:01:16.562 --> 00:01:20.510
place in the imagination of our
culture.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.050
And so, I'm going to talk about
that after we have a better

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.920
understanding of what's going on
in the book.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.301
My point, at the end of my
lecture on Lolita on

00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:38.191
Monday, was that Nabokov is
trying to imagine an autonomous

00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:42.050
work of art that has a life to
it,

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.995
that is in some sense animated
or personified,

00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:51.081
and that this desire to make
the aesthetic something living

00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:55.816
introduces to the world of the
aesthetic the problem of

00:01:55.816 --> 00:02:00.352
mortality.
It's mortality that gives it

00:02:00.352 --> 00:02:06.842
that sense of ephemeral value,
but it's also mortality that

00:02:06.842 --> 00:02:11.430
threatens to cancel it out
altogether.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.946
The language that the Beats
tried to imagine,

00:02:15.946 --> 00:02:20.668
tried to write,
takes up some of these problems

00:02:20.668 --> 00:02:24.808
that we saw in Nabokov.
Unlike Nabokov,

00:02:24.808 --> 00:02:29.737
these writers are not trying to
make a language that is

00:02:29.737 --> 00:02:33.569
autonomous and separate from the
world,

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.312
so you will not see the kind of
artifice and the labored

00:02:39.312 --> 00:02:43.334
attention to form.
You're not going to have a

00:02:43.334 --> 00:02:47.871
writer spending a month on the
representation of a barber from

00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:50.860
Kasbeam.
You're not going to get that in

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.144
the Beats.
Instead, you're getting

00:02:54.144 --> 00:02:59.719
something, a language that tries
to come as close as

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:06.060
possible--not necessarily to
life in all its facets--but to

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.210
life as we experience it.
In a certain way,

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.374
this is not a rejection of
modernism and its desire for the

00:03:16.374 --> 00:03:20.236
autonomous work of art,
because partly,

00:03:20.236 --> 00:03:24.668
as I've shown,
the desire for the autonomous

00:03:24.668 --> 00:03:30.439
work of art shades into the
desire to replicate life.

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.634
There is that desire much more
explicitly in the writing of

00:03:34.634 --> 00:03:37.237
Jack Kerouac,
the desire to replicate

00:03:37.237 --> 00:03:40.979
experience as you read,
the feeling of having the

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:45.489
experience that the writer wants
you to have and that the writer

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.726
himself has had.
That's always going to be

00:03:48.726 --> 00:03:51.580
important to understanding this
work.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.505
So, that's one aspect in which
it shares something with

00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:58.340
modernism, even though
stylistically,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.671
and as a matter of craft and
composition, it looks very

00:04:01.671 --> 00:04:04.762
distinct.
The other way it shares an

00:04:04.762 --> 00:04:09.495
ambition of modernism is
precisely in that effort to

00:04:09.495 --> 00:04:13.300
communicate experience,
consciousness.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.078
So, if you've read at all in
the novels of Virginia Woolf,

00:04:18.078 --> 00:04:21.600
for example,
or in James Joyce's novels,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.915
you know that part of modernist
innovation, part of the

00:04:26.915 --> 00:04:31.510
stylistic difficulty,
is the effort to put on the

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.776
page what happens in the mind,
that sense of the mind drifting

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:41.610
from one idea to another that
you get in Virginia Woolf's

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.259
prose,
so magically in Woolf's prose.

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:50.677
So, that is something these
writers share with modernism,

00:04:50.677 --> 00:04:56.365
but there is one big difference
and I want to exemplify that for

00:04:56.365 --> 00:05:00.879
you just by reading to you two
parallel texts,

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:06.480
one from the modernist canon
and one from the Beat canon.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.752
So, first I want to read to you
the footnote to T.S.

00:05:10.752 --> 00:05:15.596
Eliot's The Wasteland.
Now The Wasteland was

00:05:15.596 --> 00:05:19.767
the first poem to have
footnotes, and you have to ask

00:05:19.767 --> 00:05:24.260
yourself: what do you have to
think the poem is in

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.790
order to think that it needs
footnotes?

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.918
So, I'm going to say a little
bit more about that,

00:05:31.918 --> 00:05:36.889
but let me just read to you,
first, from the notes on The

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.170
Wasteland:
Not only the title,

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.339
but the plan and a good deal of
the incidental symbolism of the

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:46.759
poem were suggested by Miss
Jessie L.

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:50.188
Weston's book on the Grail
legend, From Ritual to

00:05:50.188 --> 00:05:54.393
Romance (Cambridge)." 
He has a little bibliography,

00:05:54.393 --> 00:05:55.618
there:
Indeed,

00:05:55.618 --> 00:05:58.470
so deeply am I indebted,
Miss Weston's book will

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.927
elucidate the difficulties of
the poem much better than my

00:06:01.927 --> 00:06:04.909
notes can do;
and I recommend it (apart from

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:08.625
the great interest of the book
itself) to any who think such

00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:11.459
elucidation of the poem worth
the trouble.

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:14.491
To another work of anthropology
I am indebted in general,

00:06:14.491 --> 00:06:17.360
one which has influenced our
generation profoundly;

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.623
I mean The Golden Bough;
I have used especially the two

00:06:21.623 --> 00:06:24.300
volumes Adonis,
Attis, Osiris.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.467
Anyone who is acquainted with
these works will immediately

00:06:27.467 --> 00:06:30.412
recognize in the poem certain
references to vegetation

00:06:30.412 --> 00:06:33.166
ceremonies.
And then there are particular

00:06:33.166 --> 00:06:35.519
notes for the different parts of
the poem.

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:39.889
That's the introduction to the
footnotes.

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:46.844
What I want you to note there
is the sense that the matter of

00:06:46.844 --> 00:06:53.400
the poem comes from an archive,
an archive of scholarly work,

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.259
a body of knowledge that you
read about.

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:00.469
And I also want you to note
that language:

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:04.233
"Miss Jessie Weston."
It's a very mannered,

00:07:04.233 --> 00:07:09.237
decorous language.
Now I would like to read to you

00:07:09.237 --> 00:07:14.338
from the footnote to
Howl, Allen Ginsberg's

00:07:14.338 --> 00:07:18.876
famous poem,
that for many people embodied

00:07:18.876 --> 00:07:24.931
at the time what it meant to be
engaged in this new literary

00:07:24.931 --> 00:07:28.757
project.
So, this is footnote to

00:07:28.757 --> 00:07:31.690
Howl:
Holy!

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:32.863
holy!
Holy!

00:07:32.863 --> 00:07:34.036
Holy!
Holy!

00:07:34.036 --> 00:07:35.209
Holy!
Holy!

00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:36.382
Holy!
Holy!

00:07:36.382 --> 00:07:37.555
Holy!
Holy!

00:07:37.555 --> 00:07:40.840
Holy!
holy!

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.290
The world is holy!
The soul is holy!

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.290
The skin is holy!
The nose is holy!

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:51.700
The tongue and cock and hand
and asshole holy!

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.840
Everything is holy!
Everybody's holy!

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.660
Everywhere is holy!
Every day is in eternity!

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:03.209
Everyman's an angel!
The bum's as holy as the

00:08:03.209 --> 00:08:06.618
seraphim!
the madman is holy as you my

00:08:06.618 --> 00:08:10.139
soul are holy!
The typewriter is holy!

00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:14.751
the poem is holy the voice is
holy the hearers are holy the

00:08:14.751 --> 00:08:19.448
ecstasy is holy!
Holy Peter holy Allen

00:08:19.448 --> 00:08:24.922
holy Solomon holy Lucien holy
Kerouac holy Huncke holy

00:08:24.922 --> 00:08:31.222
Burroughs holy Cassady holy the
unknown buggered and suffering

00:08:31.222 --> 00:08:36.179
beggar holy the hideous human
angels!

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:37.950
A little different tone,
don't you think?

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:46.070
A few things I want to note
about that besides the obvious.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:53.482
The fount of poetic inspiration
is not to be found in an

00:08:53.482 --> 00:08:58.230
archive.
It is not to be found in Miss

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:03.389
Jessie Weston's book on ritual
and romance.

00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:09.610
It is not to be found with a
bibliography saying "Cambridge."

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:16.029
That's not where you find the
fount of the great poem.

00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:18.425
The footnote to Howl
says that the source of

00:09:18.425 --> 00:09:20.389
Howl--that's what
footnotes are;

00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:26.625
they're an indication of the
source--it says that the source

00:09:26.625 --> 00:09:31.778
of the poetry is that holy,
lived experience,

00:09:31.778 --> 00:09:38.535
and a particular slice of lived
experience: the formerly

00:09:38.535 --> 00:09:43.260
rejected,
the indecorous, the ecstatic.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:51.719
I noticed that several of
you were smiling,

00:09:51.719 --> 00:09:55.429
in a way, as I read,
that suggested you were

00:09:55.429 --> 00:10:00.649
embarrassed by the performance.
Right?

00:10:00.649 --> 00:10:05.779
I did not elicit this by
accident.

00:10:05.779 --> 00:10:12.169
Embarrassment is something that
the Beats value.

00:10:12.169 --> 00:10:17.537
When Ginsberg first read
Howl, he was on stage,

00:10:17.537 --> 00:10:20.980
and there was a little
bathroom.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.440
It was--I think it was--in a
book store.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.042
(I can't remember;
I didn't reread my notes on

00:10:28.042 --> 00:10:33.362
Howl.) And so,
when the show started he was in

00:10:33.362 --> 00:10:37.532
the bathroom,
on the pot with the door open,

00:10:37.532 --> 00:10:41.500
and then he got up,
and he hiked up his pants,

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:47.210
and he waltzed out and he gave
his reading of Howl.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:52.865
This is indicative of the sense
that he wants to lay bare,

00:10:52.865 --> 00:10:57.529
in a literal way,
all the seaminess of human

00:10:57.529 --> 00:11:04.480
life, all the aspects of what it
means to be an embodied person,

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.399
all the ecstasies that come
from that embodiment.

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:11.305
And, of course,
this is not at all original to

00:11:11.305 --> 00:11:14.185
Ginsberg.
If you read Walt Whitman,

00:11:14.185 --> 00:11:18.882
you will see much of the same
ethos (and probably a lot better

00:11:18.882 --> 00:11:21.777
poetry).
So, Ginsberg is not the first

00:11:21.777 --> 00:11:25.024
to do this in the American
tradition, for sure,

00:11:25.024 --> 00:11:29.190
but it's a very important part
of what the Beats revive.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:34.177
And I want to get at that
question of embarrassment,

00:11:34.177 --> 00:11:38.970
because it comes up very
explicitly on page 36.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:45.914
Embarrassment is thematized in
On the Road, and

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:53.090
it's assigned what I think is a
very interesting provenance.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:04.399
So, this is Chad King talking
to Sal Paradise:

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:07.070
A quavering twang comes
out when he speaks.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:10.688
"The thing I always liked,
Sal, about the Plains Indians,

00:12:10.688 --> 00:12:14.436
was the way they always got
s'danged embarrassed after they

00:12:14.436 --> 00:12:17.149
boasted the number of scalps
they got.

00:12:17.149 --> 00:12:20.567
In Ruxton's Life in the Far
West there's an Indian who

00:12:20.567 --> 00:12:23.700
gets red all over blushing
because he got so many scalps

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.118
and he runs like hell into the
plains to glory over his deeds

00:12:27.118 --> 00:12:32.110
in hiding.
Damn, that tickled me!" 

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:39.234
The sense of embarrassment is
the sense that the excess

00:12:39.234 --> 00:12:43.323
of--what?--joy,
in this passage,

00:12:43.323 --> 00:12:48.205
the Indian's bravery,
his achievement,

00:12:48.205 --> 00:12:54.017
his success;
all of that is in excess of the

00:12:54.017 --> 00:13:00.559
decorous presentation of that
experience, of that real world

00:13:00.559 --> 00:13:07.421
of life, of that excessive joy.
And it's given here this sort

00:13:07.421 --> 00:13:12.325
of clichéd,
noble origin with the Native

00:13:12.325 --> 00:13:17.704
American, the Plains Indian.
So, there is a sense,

00:13:17.704 --> 00:13:22.741
in the Plains Indian,
that he is both the embodiment

00:13:22.741 --> 00:13:30.248
of a noble, restrained lineage;
but also, deep in that American

00:13:30.248 --> 00:13:35.200
past, is this sense of great
excess.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.503
Embarrassment tells us we're in
the presence of the excess,

00:13:40.503 --> 00:13:44.070
and that's why Beat writers
court it.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:49.649
That's why I courted it today
for you.

00:13:49.649 --> 00:13:54.137
The excess requires,
for the Beats,

00:13:54.137 --> 00:13:58.790
a new kind of language.
One aspect of their language

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:02.252
which maybe you've noticed in
On the Road--it's not

00:14:02.252 --> 00:14:06.139
quite so pronounced in On the
Road as it is elsewhere,

00:14:06.139 --> 00:14:09.954
certainly--in the letters that
these figures write to each

00:14:09.954 --> 00:14:13.813
other.
Part of that is the elimination

00:14:13.813 --> 00:14:17.029
of small words,
"the," "and";

00:14:17.029 --> 00:14:21.330
the abbreviation of certain
words, "your" to "yr."

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.309
There are all kinds of little
abbreviations they make,

00:14:24.309 --> 00:14:27.570
and it suggests that language
has to be wrenched out of its

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.500
conventions;
syntax can be set aside;

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:36.265
language needs to move at the
speed of experience and at the

00:14:36.265 --> 00:14:40.056
speed of ecstasy.
So, that's one small way in the

00:14:40.056 --> 00:14:44.352
language that they practiced
tried to imitate the experience

00:14:44.352 --> 00:14:47.409
that they were immersing
themselves in.

00:14:47.409 --> 00:14:54.521
But there were more formulated
ways of capturing that

00:14:54.521 --> 00:15:01.099
experience in language.
Jack Kerouac had a list of

00:15:01.099 --> 00:15:08.268
essentials that he taped up on
his wall when he was writing,

00:15:08.268 --> 00:15:14.234
and this is what they include:
Scribbled secret

00:15:14.234 --> 00:15:18.988
notebooks and wild typewritten
pages for your own joy [and

00:15:18.988 --> 00:15:24.204
that's "yr," your own joy].
Submissive to everything,

00:15:24.204 --> 00:15:28.071
open, listening.
Try never to get drunk

00:15:28.071 --> 00:15:32.268
outside your own house.[Well,
this is a piece of advice

00:15:32.268 --> 00:15:36.700
clearly he never took.]
Be in love with your life.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:40.690
Be crazy dumb saint of the
mind.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.769
Blow as deep as you want to
blow.

00:15:43.769 --> 00:15:47.612
Write what you want
bottomless from bottom of the

00:15:47.612 --> 00:15:51.093
mind.
The unspenspeakable visions

00:15:51.093 --> 00:15:54.950
of the individual.
In tranced fixation

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:58.409
dreaming upon object before
you.

00:15:58.409 --> 00:16:04.929
And then, my favorite one is:
"You're a genius all the time."

00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:06.810
Now, try putting that up in
front of your desk:

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:09.274
"You're a genius all the time."
It will help you to produce a

00:16:09.274 --> 00:16:13.389
lot of writing;
I guarantee.

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:19.355
Kerouac tried over and over
again to write On the

00:16:19.355 --> 00:16:25.755
Road, and it was an effort
to practice this kind of free

00:16:25.755 --> 00:16:30.962
language that would be
uninhibited and that would

00:16:30.962 --> 00:16:37.284
gesture towards some deeper,
bottomless part of the human

00:16:37.284 --> 00:16:42.340
experience, the human soul.
Sometimes it was spiritualized.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.570
In this sense,
this is why I put this quote up

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:49.374
on the board from On the
Road: "We've got to go

00:16:49.374 --> 00:16:54.340
someplace, find something."
There is a relentless seeking

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:58.120
sense that's at the heart of
this work.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.987
Now, for those of you who
don't know, On the Road

00:17:02.987 --> 00:17:07.855
does document pretty closely the
actual road trips that Jack

00:17:07.855 --> 00:17:12.970
Kerouac took with Neal Cassady
and a whole host of others,

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.589
and I can do a little decoding
for you.

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:20.796
Old Bull Lee is William
Burroughs, and his wife,

00:17:20.796 --> 00:17:32.353
Jane, Jane Lee.
So, Allen Ginsberg is Carlo

00:17:32.353 --> 00:17:45.609
Marx, and Ginsberg went to
Columbia.

00:17:45.609 --> 00:17:49.270
He was kicked out of Columbia,
and then sort of went back.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:53.314
He was in and out of school.
So, a lot of them were in this

00:17:53.314 --> 00:17:56.680
little community,
and they picked up wanderers

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.569
and various people who wanted to
learn from them.

00:18:00.569 --> 00:18:05.840
And that's what Neal Cassady
was to them at first,

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:11.971
a kind of wanderer who wanted
to be in their intellectual,

00:18:11.971 --> 00:18:14.660
but bohemian,
circle.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:21.587
So, you see the kind of
language that Neal represents at

00:18:21.587 --> 00:18:27.560
the very beginning of the novel.
First of all,

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:34.109
he's introduced in this very
mysterious way:

00:18:34.109 --> 00:18:40.029
"First reports of him."
This is on the first page of

00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:43.109
Part One, the middle of that
first paragraph:

00:18:43.109 --> 00:18:46.890
"First reports of him came to
me through Chad King,

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.753
who had shown me a few letters
from him, written in a New

00:18:50.753 --> 00:18:54.904
Mexico reform school."
So, his letters come out of

00:18:54.904 --> 00:18:58.878
this western land,
New Mexico, and a land of

00:18:58.878 --> 00:19:04.194
criminality, the reform school.
So, he's exotic just from the

00:19:04.194 --> 00:19:07.569
very beginning,
and it's an exotic language.

00:19:07.569 --> 00:19:13.131
It's the letters that come out
of this exotic place that first

00:19:13.131 --> 00:19:16.633
catch their attention.
I was tremendously

00:19:16.633 --> 00:19:19.479
interested in the letters
because they so naively and

00:19:19.479 --> 00:19:22.873
sweetly asked Chad to teach him
all about Nietzsche and all the

00:19:22.873 --> 00:19:25.609
wonderful intellectual things
that Chad knew.

00:19:25.609 --> 00:19:29.418
At one point Carlo and I talked
about the letters and wondered

00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:32.539
if we would ever meet the
strange Dean Moriarty.

00:19:32.539 --> 00:19:35.825
This is all far back,
when Dean was not the way he is

00:19:35.825 --> 00:19:39.490
today, when he was a young jail
kid shrouded in mystery.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:42.634
Then news came that Dean was
out of reform school and was

00:19:42.634 --> 00:19:44.880
coming to New York for the first
time;

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.495
also there was talk that he had
just married a girl called

00:19:48.495 --> 00:19:51.572
Marylou.
It's that passive sense:

00:19:51.572 --> 00:19:53.950
"There was talk."
Who's talking?

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:57.733
We don't know.
That passive verb,

00:19:57.733 --> 00:20:05.145
"there was talk," gives you the
sense that there is this wide

00:20:05.145 --> 00:20:11.939
community passing word mouth to
mouth of the coming of a

00:20:11.939 --> 00:20:18.980
mysterious spiritual figure:
"first reports of him;"

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:23.599
"news came;"
"there was talk."

00:20:23.599 --> 00:20:30.095
So, language is this communal
set of rumors spiritualized by

00:20:30.095 --> 00:20:34.500
its very vagueness and shared
quality.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:40.720
And then, it's just fascinating
to listen to what Dean says.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.580
Now this on page 2.
This is how he talks: 

00:20:47.849 --> 00:20:50.777
All this time Dean was
telling Marylou things like

00:20:50.777 --> 00:20:52.059
this.
"Now, darling.

00:20:52.059 --> 00:20:55.315
Here we are in New York and
although I haven't quite told

00:20:55.315 --> 00:20:58.512
you everything that I was
thinking about when we crossed

00:20:58.512 --> 00:21:01.883
the Missouri and especially at
the point when we passed the

00:21:01.883 --> 00:21:05.720
Booneville Reformatory which
reminded me of my jail problem,

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.500
it is absolutely necessary now
to postpone all those leftover

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.217
things concerning our personal
love things and at once begin

00:21:13.217 --> 00:21:15.990
thinking of specific worklife
plans ..."

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.801
and so on in,
the way that he had in those

00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:21.945
early days." 
His language is a sort of

00:21:21.945 --> 00:21:29.920
mishmash of poorly used academic
locutions: "worklife plans."

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.480
It sounds almost like corporate
speak, in a way.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:42.058
It has that dry quality to it.
And then, on the top of 3,

00:21:42.058 --> 00:21:45.852
we get another example:
"In other words we've got

00:21:45.852 --> 00:21:48.230
to get on the ball,
darling, what I'm saying,

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:51.690
otherwise it'll be fluctuating
and lack of true knowledge or

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:53.920
crystallization of our
plans."

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:59.265
So, this is not yet that
idealized speech that Kerouac is

00:21:59.265 --> 00:22:04.229
dreaming of when he writes the
list of Essentials for

00:22:04.229 --> 00:22:08.899
Spontaneous Prose.
Dean's language is not that in

00:22:08.899 --> 00:22:14.297
these passages.
His desire for the intellectual

00:22:14.297 --> 00:22:22.482
download from Chad is not what's
going to make him the figure of

00:22:22.482 --> 00:22:29.119
the new language for Sal.
Rather, it is another kind of

00:22:29.119 --> 00:22:35.326
language that he represents that
will be that kind of germ of

00:22:35.326 --> 00:22:40.480
what Sal is looking for.
This is, you see,

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.200
also on 2 at the beginning
here:

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.948
I went to the cold-water
flat with the boys and Dean came

00:22:47.948 --> 00:22:50.571
to the door in his shorts.
Marylou was jumping off the

00:22:50.571 --> 00:22:52.137
couch.
Dean had dispatched the

00:22:52.137 --> 00:22:55.446
occupant of the apartment to the
kitchen probably to make coffee

00:22:55.446 --> 00:22:58.755
while he proceeded with his love
problems for to him sex was the

00:22:58.755 --> 00:23:02.064
one and only holy and important
thing in life although he had to

00:23:02.064 --> 00:23:04.690
sweat and curse to make a living
and so on.

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:07.570
You saw that in the way he
stood bobbing his head,

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:10.450
always looking down,
nodding like a young boxer to

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:14.329
instructions to make you think
he was listening to every word,

00:23:14.329 --> 00:23:19.990
throwing in a thousand "yes"es
and "that's right." 

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:24.688
There is this sense of
enthusiasm, so his response is

00:23:24.688 --> 00:23:29.386
not an articulation of some
thought, but an effusion:

00:23:29.386 --> 00:23:31.150
"Yes;
that's right."

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:37.818
It's a visceral response,
and you see it even more

00:23:37.818 --> 00:23:41.707
clearly on 4.
So, he's staying,

00:23:41.707 --> 00:23:47.359
Dean is staying with Sal,
and Sal has been writing.

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:51.140
And they're ready to go out,
and Sal says:

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.230
"Hold on a minute.
I'll be right with you as soon

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:56.119
as I finish this chapter," and
it was one of the best chapters

00:23:56.119 --> 00:23:58.582
in the book.
Then I dressed and off we flew

00:23:58.582 --> 00:24:00.452
to New York to meet some girls."

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.510
So, I'm going to skip along a
little bit.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.130
("I wasâ€¦"
Oh, let's see.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:08.519
"As weâ€¦"Actually,
I am going to read that part.)

00:24:08.519 --> 00:24:12.553
As we rode in the bus in
the weird phosphorescent void of

00:24:12.553 --> 00:24:15.567
the Lincoln Tunnel,
we leaned on each other with

00:24:15.567 --> 00:24:18.803
fingers waving and yelled and
talked excitedly and I was

00:24:18.803 --> 00:24:21.039
beginning to get the bug like
Dean.

00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:23.869
He was simply a youth
tremendously excited with life

00:24:23.869 --> 00:24:27.031
and though he was a con man he
was only conning because he

00:24:27.031 --> 00:24:30.360
wanted so much to live and get
involved with people who would

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.579
otherwise pay no attention to
him.

00:24:32.579 --> 00:24:36.492
He was conning me and I knew it
for room and board and how to

00:24:36.492 --> 00:24:40.249
write, etc., and he knew I knew.
This had been the basis of our

00:24:40.249 --> 00:24:43.020
relationship but I didn't care
and we got along fine.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.806
No pestering, no catering.
We tiptoed around each other

00:24:45.806 --> 00:24:49.026
like heartbreaking new friends.
I began to learn from him as

00:24:49.026 --> 00:24:51.400
much as he probably learned from
me.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.384
As far as my work was
concerned, he said,

00:24:53.384 --> 00:24:56.089
"Go ahead.
Everything you do is great."

00:24:56.089 --> 00:24:59.207
He watched over my shoulder as
I wrote stories yelling,

00:24:59.207 --> 00:25:03.910
"Yes, that's right.
Wow, man," and "Phew!" 

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:11.645
"Wow" is Dean's word.
"Wow" is the kind of word that

00:25:11.645 --> 00:25:16.641
means nothing,
but it suggests the immediacy

00:25:16.641 --> 00:25:21.615
of Dean's engagement.
So, all that talking on the

00:25:21.615 --> 00:25:25.824
bus, and the way they're moving
their hands, the bug,

00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:29.789
that's all where this language
is rising from.

00:25:29.789 --> 00:25:35.871
That's where the new language
is going to come from,

00:25:35.871 --> 00:25:42.309
and you can see how Sal
assimilates that on page 35.

00:25:42.309 --> 00:25:44.900
This is just as he is coming
into Denver:

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:54.849
I said to myself,
Wow, what'll Denver be like?

00:25:54.849 --> 00:25:58.706
I got on that hot road and off
I went in a brand-new car driven

00:25:58.706 --> 00:26:01.070
by a Denver businessman of about
35.

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.880
He went 70.
I tingled all over.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.369
I counted minutes and
subtracted miles.

00:26:05.369 --> 00:26:09.323
Just ahead over the rolling
wheat fields all golden beneath

00:26:09.323 --> 00:26:13.549
the distant snows of Estes I'd
be seeing old Denver at last.

00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:17.983
I pictured myself in a Denver
bar that night with all the gang

00:26:17.983 --> 00:26:22.272
and in their eyes I would be
strange and ragged and like the

00:26:22.272 --> 00:26:26.633
prophet who has walked across
the land to bring the dark word

00:26:26.633 --> 00:26:30.049
and the only word I had was
"wow." 

00:26:30.049 --> 00:26:37.477
So Neal's--sorry--Dean's
sense (I will do this and please

00:26:37.477 --> 00:26:41.432
forgive me.
I will sometimes slip in to

00:26:41.432 --> 00:26:45.200
calling him Dean because he,
Deanâ€¦

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.759
nevermind.
You know what I'm saying.

00:26:47.759 --> 00:26:55.053
I will sometimes slip in to
calling him Neal when his name

00:26:55.053 --> 00:27:02.346
is Dean.) Dean has already
projected this mode of language

00:27:02.346 --> 00:27:05.804
into Sal,
so even as he's saying to Sal,

00:27:05.804 --> 00:27:09.332
"Teach me how to write," what
he's doing is teaching Sal how

00:27:09.332 --> 00:27:13.607
to write,
how to write this kind of book,

00:27:13.607 --> 00:27:19.289
how to be the prophet of "wow."
This is all over the text.

00:27:19.289 --> 00:27:28.480
If you look at page 62,
it's in these little stories:

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.309
Remi woke up and saw me
come in the window.

00:27:31.309 --> 00:27:35.148
His great laugh,
one of the greatest laughs in

00:27:35.148 --> 00:27:38.220
the world, dinned in my
ear.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:42.769
And then, if you just skip up
to the top of 63:

00:27:42.769 --> 00:27:46.029
The strange thing was
that next door to Remi lived a

00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:48.716
Negro called Mr.
Snow whose laugh I swear on the

00:27:48.716 --> 00:27:52.204
Bible was positively and finally
the one greatest laugh in all

00:27:52.204 --> 00:27:55.592
this world.
The laugh is a lot like the

00:27:55.592 --> 00:27:58.070
"wow."
It's that sound you make just

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:01.884
because you're experiencing
something, just because you're

00:28:01.884 --> 00:28:05.030
having a response to what's in
front of you,

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.700
something someone says.
Okay.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:13.497
That's another example.
And the last one I'll give you

00:28:13.497 --> 00:28:17.694
is on 55.
This is when they've gone up to

00:28:17.694 --> 00:28:23.599
the mountain pass after getting
in fights in the bars in Denver:

00:28:23.599 --> 00:28:27.059
In the whole eastern dark
wall of the divide this night

00:28:27.059 --> 00:28:30.172
there was silence and the
whisper of the wind except in

00:28:30.172 --> 00:28:33.689
the ravine where we roared and
on the other side of the divide

00:28:33.689 --> 00:28:37.091
was the great Western Slope and
the big plateau that went to

00:28:37.091 --> 00:28:40.262
Steamboat Springs and dropped
and led you to the western

00:28:40.262 --> 00:28:43.721
Colorado desert and the Utah
desert all in darkness now as we

00:28:43.721 --> 00:28:46.720
fumed and screamed in our
mountain nook,

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.529
mad, drunken Americans in the
mighty land.

00:28:49.529 --> 00:28:53.673
We were on the roof of America
and all we could do was yell I

00:28:53.673 --> 00:28:57.636
guess across the night,
eastward over the plains where

00:28:57.636 --> 00:29:01.811
somewhere an old man with white
hair was probably walking

00:29:01.811 --> 00:29:06.284
towards us with the word and
would arrive any minute and make

00:29:06.284 --> 00:29:11.255
us silent.
Their yell at the top of the

00:29:11.255 --> 00:29:18.430
world seems to Sal something
that calls for a replacement;

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:23.722
it calls for some other prophet
to come walking ragged towards

00:29:23.722 --> 00:29:27.799
them and make them fall silent
with his word.

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:31.847
But, in the meantime,
what you have is the continual

00:29:31.847 --> 00:29:36.623
reproduction of that yell,
that laugh, that "wow," that

00:29:36.623 --> 00:29:42.185
"yes," that "that's all right,"
all those things that they say

00:29:42.185 --> 00:29:47.564
just to register their existence
and their relation with one

00:29:47.564 --> 00:29:51.591
another.
I want to note something

00:29:51.591 --> 00:29:55.956
else, though,
about the first time that Dean

00:29:55.956 --> 00:30:01.640
and Sal meet and the
contextualizing of that meeting.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.925
When they first meet in that
passage that I read to you,

00:30:04.925 --> 00:30:08.687
he's just rising up from having
sex on the couch with Marylou in

00:30:08.687 --> 00:30:11.598
someone else's apartment.
He sent the owner of the

00:30:11.598 --> 00:30:14.641
apartment into the kitchen so he
could have sex with Marylou on

00:30:14.641 --> 00:30:18.055
the couch.
In other versions he says that

00:30:18.055 --> 00:30:23.420
Dean got up and was naked,
not that he was in his shorts.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.664
There is an immediate sexual
sense that charges the

00:30:26.664 --> 00:30:29.000
relationship between these
people.

00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:37.682
Those relationships take place
in the context of continual

00:30:37.682 --> 00:30:40.620
negotiations of sexual
relationships,

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:45.109
and so the book begins with
that explanation that:

00:30:45.109 --> 00:30:51.009
I first met Dean not long
after my wife and I split up.

00:30:51.009 --> 00:30:53.400
I had just gotten over a
serious illness that I won't

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.297
bother to talk about except that
it had something to do with the

00:30:56.297 --> 00:30:59.148
miserably weary splitting up and
my feeling that everything was

00:30:59.148 --> 00:31:02.159
dead.
Dean's negotiations between

00:31:02.159 --> 00:31:05.958
Marylou and Camille in
Denver--where he has his

00:31:05.958 --> 00:31:08.638
schedule,
and he has his exact time he

00:31:08.638 --> 00:31:12.197
has to get from one hotel to the
other to sleep with each of

00:31:12.197 --> 00:31:15.425
them,
and then he has to meet Carlo

00:31:15.425 --> 00:31:19.969
Ginsberg, Carlo Marx,
in the basement to have his

00:31:19.969 --> 00:31:25.554
conversations to get to the
"bottomlessness" of each other's

00:31:25.554 --> 00:31:30.950
mind--all those negotiations are
absolutely crucial.

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:34.227
It's what they spend their time
talking about,

00:31:34.227 --> 00:31:37.543
often.
It's what they spend their time

00:31:37.543 --> 00:31:40.898
negotiating.
So, the search for the

00:31:40.898 --> 00:31:45.994
immediate language of experience
is part and parcel of a very

00:31:45.994 --> 00:31:51.259
complex negotiation of sexual
ties between multiple people.

00:31:51.259 --> 00:31:54.119
And it's not just between the
men and the women.

00:31:54.119 --> 00:31:55.609
It's between the men and the
men.

00:31:55.609 --> 00:32:00.956
And that moment when Sal meets
Dean at the door,

00:32:00.956 --> 00:32:05.595
and he's naked;
it's reflected when he sees

00:32:05.595 --> 00:32:09.495
Dean with Camille.
Camille opens the door to their

00:32:09.495 --> 00:32:13.036
room when they're in Denver,
and he finally sees Dean in

00:32:13.036 --> 00:32:15.631
Denver.
He opens the door to the room,

00:32:15.631 --> 00:32:19.078
and there is a picture that
Camille has drawn of Dean:

00:32:19.078 --> 00:32:21.549
a portrait of him completely
naked,

00:32:21.549 --> 00:32:27.799
and it notes his penis in that
picture.

00:32:27.799 --> 00:32:33.537
It's as if Sal's first
experience of Dean is already,

00:32:33.537 --> 00:32:38.282
in that scene,
assimilated into the image of

00:32:38.282 --> 00:32:43.910
Dean: the disembodied,
aesthetic image of Dean.

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:48.334
But that aesthetic image of
Dean is all bound up in these

00:32:48.334 --> 00:32:51.174
negotiations.
So, it's a picture that Camille

00:32:51.174 --> 00:32:54.535
has drawn, and of course Camille
doesn't know that he's sleeping

00:32:54.535 --> 00:32:57.150
with Marylou in another hotel on
the same day,

00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:00.686
and so on.
So, all of that is very

00:33:00.686 --> 00:33:06.122
palpable, and Sal's own desire
for Dean is sublimated in those

00:33:06.122 --> 00:33:11.470
scenes, but it's everywhere at
the level of the language.

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:16.076
And, if you note the repeated
presence of that question,

00:33:16.076 --> 00:33:18.880
where was Dean?
Where was Dean?

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:22.972
He's always missing.
When Sal gets to Denver,

00:33:22.972 --> 00:33:27.221
that's what he wants to know.
When he gets back to New York,

00:33:27.221 --> 00:33:31.050
finally, at the end of this
first road trip,

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:36.106
he has missed Dean.
There's always the sense that

00:33:36.106 --> 00:33:41.018
Dean evades him,
and I think part of that sense

00:33:41.018 --> 00:33:44.970
of an evading object of desire
is,

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:50.390
again, the pursuit of sex in
this novel;

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:51.750
it's part of the pursuit of sex.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.604
You might think,
given all this,

00:34:00.604 --> 00:34:05.009
and given the ultimate plot of
On the Road,

00:34:05.009 --> 00:34:10.055
that being on the road is about
pursuing that kind of desire,

00:34:10.055 --> 00:34:13.672
and that it is necessitated by
leaving home:

00:34:13.672 --> 00:34:18.550
you have to leave home in order
to pursue that desire.

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:22.599
But I would suggest to you that
home is absolutely crucial to

00:34:22.599 --> 00:34:27.310
the production of this desire.
And I want to point you to page

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.640
26.

00:34:33.329 --> 00:34:41.331
This is Sal's story about Big
Slim Hazard, a hobo that he once

00:34:41.331 --> 00:34:45.929
knew.
He was a hobo by choice: 

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:48.630
As a little boy,
he'd seen a hobo come up to ask

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:51.687
his mother for a piece of pie
and she had given it to him and

00:34:51.687 --> 00:34:55.000
when the hobo went off down the
road the little boy had said,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.329
"Ma, what was that fellow?"
"Why, that's a hobo."

00:34:58.329 --> 00:35:01.950
"Ma, I want to be a hobo
someday."

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:04.820
"Shut your mouth.
That's not for the like of the

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.443
Hazards."
But he never forgot that day

00:35:07.443 --> 00:35:11.469
and when he grew up after a
short spell playing football at

00:35:11.469 --> 00:35:16.222
LSU he did become a hobo.
Being a hobo is produced in

00:35:16.222 --> 00:35:21.363
this little vignette by the
experience of seeing a hobo get

00:35:21.363 --> 00:35:26.027
pie from your mother.
Now, did any of you notice how

00:35:26.027 --> 00:35:32.387
often Sal eats pie?
Let me just demonstrate the

00:35:32.387 --> 00:35:39.429
litany of pie.
Okay, page 15.

00:35:39.429 --> 00:35:43.269
Actually, let's start on 14,
or perhaps on 13:

00:35:43.269 --> 00:35:47.961
"Along about three in the
morning after an apple pie and

00:35:47.961 --> 00:35:51.630
ice cream in a roadside
standâ€¦."

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:54.099
That's Sal.
Top of 14: 

00:35:54.099 --> 00:35:55.949
I ate another apple pie
and ice cream.

00:35:55.949 --> 00:35:58.969
That's practically all I ate
all the way across the country.

00:35:58.969 --> 00:36:01.920
I knew it was nutritious and it
was delicious.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.531
Fifteen, bottom:
I ate apple pie and ice

00:36:06.531 --> 00:36:09.107
cream.
It was getting better as I got

00:36:09.107 --> 00:36:10.996
deeper in to Iowa,
the pie bigger,

00:36:10.996 --> 00:36:13.823
the ice cream richer.
There were the most beautiful

00:36:13.823 --> 00:36:16.478
bevies of girls everywhere I
looked in Des Moines that

00:36:16.478 --> 00:36:18.744
afternoon.
They were coming home from high

00:36:18.744 --> 00:36:22.024
school but I had no time now for
thoughts like that and promised

00:36:22.024 --> 00:36:26.157
myself a ball in Denver.
And if you look on 107,

00:36:26.157 --> 00:36:31.309
the first thing Sal does when
he gets home is eat.

00:36:31.309 --> 00:36:34.400
When I got home I ate
everything in the icebox.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.630
My mother got up and looked at
me.

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:38.480
"Poor little Salvatore," she
said in Italian.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:42.226
"You're thin. You're thin.
Where have you been all this

00:36:42.226 --> 00:36:44.245
time?"
I had on two shirts and two

00:36:44.245 --> 00:36:46.293
sweaters.
My canvas bag had torn

00:36:46.293 --> 00:36:50.138
cottonfield pants and the
tattered remnants of my huarache

00:36:50.138 --> 00:36:52.900
shoes in it.
My aunt and I decided to buy a

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:56.343
new electric refrigerator with
the money I had sent her from

00:36:56.343 --> 00:36:59.498
California;
it was to be the first one in

00:36:59.498 --> 00:37:02.919
the family.
There is a sense in which

00:37:02.919 --> 00:37:07.803
hunger, the hunger generated by
the road, in Sal's case in this

00:37:07.803 --> 00:37:13.290
last scene--he's been penniless;
all he had was cough drops to

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:18.656
eat at the very end--that the
hunger generated by the road

00:37:18.656 --> 00:37:24.400
exists in a necessary relation
to the consumption of home.

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:28.205
And I would suggest to you that
the consumption of home is

00:37:28.205 --> 00:37:31.210
driven by a certain kind of
desire as well,

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:37.726
that desire to move up in the
American class structure:

00:37:37.726 --> 00:37:43.639
"the first electric
refrigerator in my family."

00:37:43.639 --> 00:37:47.320
He's earned a little money on
the road and sent it home.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:52.910
What it does for him is allow
him to buy his aunt this symbol

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:56.730
of a middle-class American
domesticity,

00:37:56.730 --> 00:38:01.769
and he is a happy participant
in this new purchase.

00:38:01.769 --> 00:38:05.509
This is not exactly just
what the women do while the boys

00:38:05.509 --> 00:38:09.639
are out on the road.
The boys want the pie.

00:38:09.639 --> 00:38:14.949
The boys want to become hobos
because there's a kind of hunger

00:38:14.949 --> 00:38:18.799
that's generated at home;
it's satisfied at home,

00:38:18.799 --> 00:38:20.949
but it's also generated at
home.

00:38:20.949 --> 00:38:26.320
And I want to suggest to you
that part of the misogyny of the

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.885
novel--which I'm sure is
palpable to all of us as we

00:38:30.885 --> 00:38:36.165
read--part of that misogyny is
connected to this consumptive

00:38:36.165 --> 00:38:40.060
ethos.
So, when we talk about desire

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:45.993
for something--"we've got to go
someplace, find something--the

00:38:45.993 --> 00:38:52.218
very vagueness of that desire is
connected with the basic hungers

00:38:52.218 --> 00:38:59.489
of the body for sex,
for food, for sleep even.

00:38:59.489 --> 00:39:04.805
We see Dean sort of begging for
sleep after his conversation

00:39:04.805 --> 00:39:08.769
with Carlo Marx in the basement
in Denver.

00:39:08.769 --> 00:39:14.326
Those kinds of desires are
connected also with that

00:39:14.326 --> 00:39:19.550
American habit of consumption.
This is a consumer society;

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:24.820
in the 1950s it was already
very much so.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:30.900
The mass production after World
War II had already taken hold.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:34.488
Supermarkets,
as we saw in Wise Blood,

00:39:34.488 --> 00:39:38.435
are already something one
can be fond of,

00:39:38.435 --> 00:39:42.654
as Enoch was.
And so, if this is a novel

00:39:42.654 --> 00:39:47.006
whose aura has always said to
us, "Be free,

00:39:47.006 --> 00:39:49.390
be countercultural,"

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:57.619
what I'm suggesting is that
it's structured around a very

00:39:57.619 --> 00:40:02.849
deeply embedded American
cultural trait of consumption.

00:40:02.849 --> 00:40:10.086
It spiritualizes that kind of
desire, and my symbol for it is

00:40:10.086 --> 00:40:10.810
pie.

00:40:22.269 --> 00:40:26.030
I want to show you one last
thing about how the language

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:28.070
works, and this is on page 49.

00:40:38.719 --> 00:40:44.012
To set aside the critique of
that search for a moment,

00:40:44.012 --> 00:40:50.003
I just want to move back into
it in these spiritual terms and

00:40:50.003 --> 00:40:55.080
see what we can see.
When Dean and Carlo are talking

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:58.625
to each other,
there's a lot of anxiety on

00:40:58.625 --> 00:41:03.554
either part about whether they
have actually attained that

00:41:03.554 --> 00:41:06.840
thing that they were looking
for.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:12.900
On 48, their talk is described
as business in the beginning.

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.599
Then they got down to
business.

00:41:14.599 --> 00:41:17.849
They sat on the bed
cross-legged and looked at each

00:41:17.849 --> 00:41:20.210
other.
I slouched in a nearby chair

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:22.904
and saw all of it.
They began with an abstract

00:41:22.904 --> 00:41:25.685
thought, discussed it,
reminded each other of another

00:41:25.685 --> 00:41:28.360
abstract point forgotten in the
rush of events.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.778
Dean apologized but promised he
could get back to it and manage

00:41:31.778 --> 00:41:34.150
it fine, bringing up
illustrations.

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:38.468
And then, they have this very
complicated back-and-forth about

00:41:38.468 --> 00:41:42.291
things that they remembered,
or didn't, and they hashed

00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:45.927
these things over:
Then Carlo asked Dean if

00:41:45.927 --> 00:41:50.009
he was honest and specifically
if he was being honest with him

00:41:50.009 --> 00:41:52.995
in the bottom of his soul.
"Why do you bring that up

00:41:52.995 --> 00:41:54.880
again?"
"There is one last thing I want

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.080
to know.'"
"But dear Sal, you're listening.

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.880
You are sitting there.
We'll ask Sal.

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:04.207
What would he say?"
And I said, "That last thing is

00:42:04.207 --> 00:42:06.800
what you can't get,
Carlo.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.099
Nobody can get to that last
thing.

00:42:09.099 --> 00:42:14.739
We keep on living in hopes of
catching it once for all."

00:42:15.559 --> 00:42:18.935
So, all this language is
produced because you can't ever

00:42:18.935 --> 00:42:21.901
get to that last thing;
you have to keep hashing it

00:42:21.901 --> 00:42:25.605
over.
But if you go to the next page

00:42:25.605 --> 00:42:31.925
you can see--or actually two
pages over--you can see that

00:42:31.925 --> 00:42:38.584
already Sal is taking what he
can get from this language and

00:42:38.584 --> 00:42:44.340
transposing it into his
experience of reality.

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:51.706
So Carlo had earlier--sorry to
flip back and forth so much--had

00:42:51.706 --> 00:42:57.290
read earlier his poem--this is
on 47--to Sal.

00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:03.720
He had been reading poetry.
Carlo woke up in the

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.177
morning and heard the vulgar
pigeons yakking in the street

00:43:06.177 --> 00:43:08.334
outside his cell.
He saw the sad nightingales

00:43:08.334 --> 00:43:11.260
nodding on the branches and they
reminded him of his mother.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.190
A gray shroud fell over the
city.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.848
The mountains,
the magnificent Rockies that

00:43:15.848 --> 00:43:18.697
you can see to the west from any
part of town,

00:43:18.697 --> 00:43:21.481
were papier-mache.
The whole universe was crazy

00:43:21.481 --> 00:43:23.570
and cockeyed and extremely
strange.

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:26.900
So, this is what Carlo
represents in his poetry.

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.817
Well, if you look,
Sal, after witnessing what it

00:43:29.817 --> 00:43:32.860
means--what their business is
with one another,

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:39.361
the way they try to get to the
bottom of each other's soul--he

00:43:39.361 --> 00:43:45.329
looks out, and he sees the world
through Carlo's eyes.

00:43:45.329 --> 00:43:48.000
He's been awake all this time
listening:

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.510
"What were you thinking,
Sal?"

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:54.327
I told them that I was thinking
they were very amazing maniacs

00:43:54.327 --> 00:43:58.081
and that I had spent the whole
night listening to them like a

00:43:58.081 --> 00:44:01.961
man watching the mechanism of a
watch that reached clear to the

00:44:01.961 --> 00:44:05.904
top of Berthoud Pass and was yet
made with the smallest works of

00:44:05.904 --> 00:44:08.720
the most delicate watch in the
world.

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.311
They smiled.
I pointed my finger at them and

00:44:11.311 --> 00:44:14.458
said, "If you keep this up,
you'll both go crazy but let me

00:44:14.458 --> 00:44:16.519
know what happens as you go
along."

00:44:16.519 --> 00:44:20.929
I walked out and took a trolley
to my apartment and Carlo Marx's

00:44:20.929 --> 00:44:25.199
papier-mache mountains grew red
as the great sun rose from the

00:44:25.199 --> 00:44:29.937
eastward plains.
So, the poetry that is part and

00:44:29.937 --> 00:44:35.302
parcel of the conversation
between Dean and Carlo--Carlo's

00:44:35.302 --> 00:44:39.349
poetry--seeps out of that
basement room.

00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:43.678
And there's a real spatial
sense here, that it's being

00:44:43.678 --> 00:44:46.699
generated at the base of the
world,

00:44:46.699 --> 00:44:50.735
and it goes up and it
transforms these mountains into

00:44:50.735 --> 00:44:54.673
papier-mache.
It makes them in one sense

00:44:54.673 --> 00:44:57.829
false;
there is a falseness to the

00:44:57.829 --> 00:45:03.630
overlay that Carlo gives to Sal,
and through which he then sees.

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:06.746
There's a falseness,
a craftedness,

00:45:06.746 --> 00:45:10.230
but it's a kind of folk
craftedness.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:12.570
This is not the craftedness of
modernism.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:17.420
This is papier-mache,
a fairly crude folk art.

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:20.777
Anyone can do it.
Get your strips of newspaper

00:45:20.777 --> 00:45:24.961
and paste them up.
So, it has a quality that is

00:45:24.961 --> 00:45:30.089
different from Humbert's
elaborate world view through

00:45:30.089 --> 00:45:33.639
which we see or don't see
Lolita.

00:45:33.639 --> 00:45:39.077
It's a very different kind of
crafting, but yet it does

00:45:39.077 --> 00:45:44.615
replace reality in a similar
way, or it makes demands on

00:45:44.615 --> 00:45:51.088
reality that push the real back.
And so, even though they

00:45:51.088 --> 00:45:57.599
can never get to the bottom of
their souls--they can never get,

00:45:57.599 --> 00:46:00.090
as Sal says,
that last thing,

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:05.250
that's what you can never
have--even though that's true,

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:13.125
it has this world-making power.
To what end will that power be

00:46:13.125 --> 00:46:15.541
used?
This is one question I want you

00:46:15.541 --> 00:46:18.070
to think about as you finish
this novel.

00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:22.950
What do these figures think
language can be used for?

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:29.829
What's it good for?
What can it do for them?

00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:33.655
What beyond that kind of
economics of desire,

00:46:33.655 --> 00:46:39.365
that accounting?
If you look on 107-108,

00:46:39.365 --> 00:46:49.638
again at the very end of the
section: "I had my home to go

00:46:49.638 --> 00:46:52.818
to,
my place to lay my head down

00:46:52.818 --> 00:46:57.241
and figure the losses and figure
the gain that I knew was in

00:46:57.241 --> 00:47:00.140
there somewhere too."
What are the losses?

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:04.896
What are the gains?
Is it just a representation of

00:47:04.896 --> 00:47:10.141
an imaginative and desireful
economy, or is there some other

00:47:10.141 --> 00:47:14.180
thing being produced here?
What is the something?

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:18.674
What is the someplace?
So, in that relation,

00:47:18.674 --> 00:47:22.643
I'd like you to think about the
representation of America in the

00:47:22.643 --> 00:47:25.525
novel.
What do you see there when you

00:47:25.525 --> 00:47:30.310
think about the America they're
giving us, all these figures?

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:33.359
So, that's for your reading.
In section please bring

00:47:33.359 --> 00:47:35.445
Lolita.
I think you're going to

00:47:35.445 --> 00:47:37.469
spend most of your time talking
about Lolita.

00:47:37.469 --> 00:47:40.729
Section for On the Road
will probably be next week

00:47:40.729 --> 00:47:44.260
unless your TF wants to bring up
some brief questions about it,

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:45.993
but that's all for today.

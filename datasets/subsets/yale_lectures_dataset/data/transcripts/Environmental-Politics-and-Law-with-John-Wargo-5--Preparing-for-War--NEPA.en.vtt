00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.990
Prof: A student,
a former student of mine,

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.120
emailed me last night from Lake
Tahoe,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.097
where they had received six
feet of snow in the past four

00:00:11.097 --> 00:00:11.720
days.
 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.973
Can you imagine that compared
to what seems like an

00:00:15.973 --> 00:00:18.610
interesting day outside here?
 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.670
The western storms are really
quite terrific this year.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.250
If any of you are outdoor
enthusiasts.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.220
So Mammoth Mountain in Southern
California received eight feet

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.213
of snow last week,
Squaw six, Jackson Hole between

00:00:35.213 --> 00:00:36.680
six and seven.
 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.564
It's really quite remarkable,
one storm after another is

00:00:39.564 --> 00:00:40.980
pummeling the West Coast.
 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.462
So today I want to continue and
conclude the discussion about

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:49.944
nuclear experimentation and have
you think a bit more with me

00:00:49.944 --> 00:00:53.604
about guidelines for
experimentation and how those

00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:56.070
might be embedded into law.
 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.289
And I also want to start out by
having you consider the central

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.490
challenges that were faced by
the president,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.329
the Defense Department,
and the Atomic Energy

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:07.170
Commission.
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.944
So that imagine yourself in the
position of trying to figure how

00:01:12.944 --> 00:01:18.170
rapidly to develop the nuclear
testing program and how you

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.120
might guide it and what the
central purposes were.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.366
So underlying the plan and the
research was really the need to

00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:31.263
understand what our resilience
would be in the face of an

00:01:31.263 --> 00:01:32.030
attack.
 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.495
The construction of weaponry
that would be deliverable was

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:38.748
one problem,
but that was more of a

00:01:38.748 --> 00:01:42.241
technical problem,
compared to wondering about how

00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:44.510
we might survive an attack.
 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.927
A central question associated
with that is how to minimize

00:01:48.927 --> 00:01:53.266
human exposure for what periods
of time were necessary to

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:57.180
prevent long-term illness,
and how to decontaminate and

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.530
restore the environment.
 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.417
Also how to convince the public
of the need for continued

00:02:03.417 --> 00:02:08.914
testing as evidence kept leaking
out into the press in a variety

00:02:08.914 --> 00:02:12.441
of ways,
but not in small part because

00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:16.068
of the availability of detection
equipment.

00:02:16.068 --> 00:02:20.970
So Geiger counters were not a
technology that was required to

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.300
be licensed or under the control
of the government.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.474
Also, the x-ray film,
as I described,

00:02:27.474 --> 00:02:30.860
being overexposed when it
arrived at hospitals led people

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.639
to understand that something was
going on.

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:37.459
They also faced the challenge
of how to maintain their

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.180
secrets.
 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.705
And they established a very
large element within their

00:02:42.705 --> 00:02:47.997
bureaucracy to work on different
processes to encourage workers

00:02:47.997 --> 00:02:52.779
to change their behavior in a
way that would minimize the

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:56.280
opportunity for leaking of
secrets.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.794
And then the central question
that we'll look at today is,

00:02:59.794 --> 00:03:03.125
if you have a population that's
been seriously exposed,

00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:04.788
how do you manage them?
 

00:03:04.788 --> 00:03:06.710
How do you manage their
complaints?

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.247
What kind of provisions would
you make for them in terms of

00:03:10.247 --> 00:03:12.258
long-term care or compensation?
 

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:16.816
So in example after example
among the 2,000 tests that were

00:03:16.816 --> 00:03:22.098
conducted during this period,
you find workers and military

00:03:22.098 --> 00:03:25.438
officials being intensely
exposed.

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:28.915
Those closest to the site
experienced the highest degrees

00:03:28.915 --> 00:03:31.711
of radiation,
often without recognition of

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:34.930
what they'd experienced or
without understanding.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.616
And something that was really
quite remarkable following the

00:03:39.616 --> 00:03:43.716
test in the Bikini Atoll,
when you had a hundred ships

00:03:43.716 --> 00:03:47.669
that were lined up encircling
the blast site was that almost

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.169
instantaneously,
they created a massive amount

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:52.660
of hazardous waste.
 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.931
And they had no understanding
of what the implications might

00:03:56.931 --> 00:03:59.318
be for dealing with that waste.
 

00:03:59.318 --> 00:04:02.924
And if you step back and you
think about the location of the

00:04:02.924 --> 00:04:06.038
testing site in the middle of
the Pacific Ocean,

00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:09.223
they were very conscious of
what really has become a

00:04:09.223 --> 00:04:12.469
fundamental principal of
managing the environment and

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:17.060
producing environmental quality,
which is the idea that dilution

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.269
is the solution to pollution.
 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.846
So that the expectation that
the technological danger will

00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:28.502
somehow dissipate as it moves
further and further away from

00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:33.240
the point of release across
space and time to pose no danger

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.569
and eventually go away.
 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:37.389
And one interesting idea behind
this idea,

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.262
behind the presumption that
pollution is just going to go

00:04:41.262 --> 00:04:45.619
away is that it's pretty easy to
conclude that if you don't have

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:48.040
sensitive detection technology.
 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.690
So if you can't see a
pollutant, you can't taste it,

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.569
you can't smell it,
you can't feel it,

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:01.151
if you don't have a
technologically sophisticated

00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:05.593
surveillance system in place,
people presume that it's gone

00:05:05.593 --> 00:05:06.019
away.
 

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:09.117
So gradually,
they realized that they needed

00:05:09.117 --> 00:05:12.360
to understand this
distributional pattern more

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.370
carefully.
 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.910
But the assumption was that the
atmosphere and the oceans

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.045
provided almost an infinite
sink, an opportunity for

00:05:22.045 --> 00:05:23.910
diluting pollution.
 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.778
Interesting idea.
 

00:05:25.778 --> 00:05:29.827
So they looked at billions of
pounds of hazardous waste in the

00:05:29.827 --> 00:05:32.348
form of these ships and
wondered, well,

00:05:32.348 --> 00:05:34.870
what are we going to do with
them?

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.519
It's kind of curious what they
did initially.

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:39.519
They decided they were just
going to spray them with water.

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:43.889
So they brought boats alongside
the ships and they started

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.492
hosing them off,
assuming that the radionuclides

00:05:47.492 --> 00:05:50.560
would somehow wash off into the
sea.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.420
The sailors on the ships
started scrubbing them with

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.949
soap.
 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.250
Then they found that the
nuclides didn't dissipate.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.028
They used solvents.
 

00:06:00.028 --> 00:06:04.100
They started bombing them with
ground up coconut shells.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.160
And nothing seemed to work.
 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.031
It's kind of interesting here
thinking too that these sailors

00:06:10.031 --> 00:06:13.774
are standing on the deck of an
irradiated destroyer with no

00:06:13.774 --> 00:06:17.060
protection gear,
absolutely none.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.310
Actually, in 1987,
in the Chernobyl nuclear power

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.245
plant explosion,
you see a similar degree of

00:06:26.245 --> 00:06:30.303
disregard for worker safety
among those that were brought in

00:06:30.303 --> 00:06:33.949
to put the fire out and also to
clean up the mess.

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:40.480
Dramatic misunderstanding on
the part of those exposed,

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.709
despite the fact that the
technical knowledge,

00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:47.387
understanding the danger,
was pretty well understood

00:06:47.387 --> 00:06:51.281
among the people that were
giving the orders to the GIs

00:06:51.281 --> 00:06:51.930
here.
 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.829
So one of the solutions was,
well, let's bury some of it.

00:06:55.829 --> 00:06:58.238
We'll just sink some of the
boats that are in the worst

00:06:58.238 --> 00:07:00.194
shape,
or we'll find out what parts of

00:07:00.194 --> 00:07:03.408
the ship are most irradiated and
figure out what to do with those

00:07:03.408 --> 00:07:03.910
pieces.
 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.189
Kind of an interesting thought.
 

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:09.346
So you've got this atoll,
which is basically the crater

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:12.656
of an old volcano,
poking out of the Pacific

00:07:12.656 --> 00:07:16.120
Ocean, a few strands of beach
ringing it.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.149
You put a hundred ships in
there.

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:20.810
You explode a bomb underwater.
 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.803
And Michael Oppenheimer,
who was the first director of

00:07:24.803 --> 00:07:29.632
the Los Alamos Laboratory,
responsible for the design of

00:07:29.632 --> 00:07:34.827
the first atomic bomb that was
tested at Los Alamos in New

00:07:34.827 --> 00:07:38.154
Mexico,
Michael Oppenheimer warned very

00:07:38.154 --> 00:07:42.579
vigorously against exploding a
nuclear device underwater,

00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:45.910
especially within an atoll,
because it would create,

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.815
in his words,
a toxic soup that would persist

00:07:49.815 --> 00:07:54.259
and contaminate the coral,
it would contaminate the

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:57.562
underlying sands,
and it would contaminate the

00:07:57.562 --> 00:07:59.839
water and marine life for
decades.

00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:03.839
It would basically make that
fishery no longer suitable for

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:05.220
human consumption.
 

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.230
Quite interesting to see the
moral and ethical arguments

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.406
among the physicists who were
responsible for the design of

00:08:11.406 --> 00:08:13.870
these weapons back at that point
in time.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:19.869
Very compelling arguments not
to use these weapons that were

00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:22.310
above a specific size.
 

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:26.262
Oppenheimer and his close
colleagues and friends were

00:08:26.262 --> 00:08:30.139
branded as Communists and
communist sympathizers.

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:32.350
There was some legitimacy for
that.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.048
He was a Socialist in his own
political thinking,

00:08:35.048 --> 00:08:38.947
but it was quite curious to see
the way the Atomic Energy

00:08:38.947 --> 00:08:43.261
Commission attacked him and sent
up spies to follow him and see

00:08:43.261 --> 00:08:45.490
who he was associating with.
 

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.351
You can now find this out by
going back into this

00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:50.379
declassified documents database.
 

00:08:50.379 --> 00:08:54.360
And then the trials that
eventually were held to remove

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.309
him from the Atomic Energy
Commission.

00:08:57.309 --> 00:08:59.590
So they've got this waste.
 

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.220
They don't really know what to
do with it.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.942
They began to take some of the
ships and drag them back across

00:09:06.942 --> 00:09:08.570
the Pacific to U.S.
 

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:09.428
ports.
 

00:09:09.428 --> 00:09:12.427
So here is an example of an
aircraft carrier that was

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:15.543
dragged into the port of San
Francisco, called Hunter's

00:09:15.543 --> 00:09:16.120
Point.
 

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.048
Anybody here from San Francisco?
 

00:09:18.048 --> 00:09:22.019
Well, you may know this area,
next to the Bayview community.

00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:23.820
It's quite an interesting area.
 

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.668
Well, they didn't really know
what to do there.

00:09:25.668 --> 00:09:28.850
This was an experiment in
progress, an experiment largely

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:29.928
without controls.
 

00:09:29.928 --> 00:09:33.015
But imagine,
bringing the radioactive waste

00:09:33.015 --> 00:09:37.129
into one of the largest cities
on the West Coast that was

00:09:37.129 --> 00:09:41.613
surrounded by people and then
trying to remove the radioactive

00:09:41.613 --> 00:09:45.139
material from the ship by
sandblasting it.

00:09:45.139 --> 00:09:50.504
And sandblasting is a notorious
technology for simply grinding

00:09:50.504 --> 00:09:54.639
away at hard surfaces to remove
the residues.

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:55.860
And what happens to it?
 

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.139
Well basically,
it just goes up into the air.

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:01.529
Or if it's foggy or if it's
raining, it'll rain down and

00:10:01.529 --> 00:10:03.750
then wash into eventually the
Bay.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.580
Hunter's Point sits on the Bay.
 

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:10.674
So you can see Hunter's Point
in this map from Google Earth

00:10:10.674 --> 00:10:11.730
over here.
 

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.052
And you see the Bayview
District right now,

00:10:15.052 --> 00:10:19.009
only probably less than a mile
from Highway 101.

00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:22.360
And like many other ports in
the United States,

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.500
the port at Long Beach,
port at Newport News,

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.065
Virginia, up and down the East
Coast and the West Coast and the

00:10:30.065 --> 00:10:32.917
Gulf Coast,
you really find a contaminated

00:10:32.917 --> 00:10:36.330
soup of a variety of different
toxic substances,

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:42.470
often in rather close proximity
to very densely populated areas.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.373
So in this case,
it's also quite curious that

00:10:45.373 --> 00:10:48.538
this is now the site of a very
active protest.

00:10:48.538 --> 00:10:52.082
Many people that live adjacent
to these military sites are

00:10:52.082 --> 00:10:54.570
quite concerned about their
exposures.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.700
And it also is the subject,
the target of a renewal effort

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.857
in San Francisco,
the San Francisco Redevelopment

00:11:01.857 --> 00:11:04.629
Authority,
hopes to take a 14,000-acre

00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:07.129
tract of land and redevelop it.
 

00:11:07.129 --> 00:11:13.342
This also happens to be a
center of ethnic minorities in

00:11:13.342 --> 00:11:18.538
San Francisco,
especially African Americans.

00:11:18.538 --> 00:11:22.022
And these people are quite
concerned that the same

00:11:22.022 --> 00:11:26.284
redevelopment effect will occur
at Bayview as occurred in the

00:11:26.284 --> 00:11:29.908
Fillmore District when the
government came in,

00:11:29.908 --> 00:11:32.976
took over property,
basically forced out tenants

00:11:32.976 --> 00:11:36.500
and the poorest in the community
and gentrified it,

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:41.206
dramatically changing the socio
and demographic characteristics

00:11:41.206 --> 00:11:42.269
of the area.
 

00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:45.231
So gradually,
by the late 1990s,

00:11:45.231 --> 00:11:50.774
we had a pretty good image of
what happened to all of these

00:11:50.774 --> 00:11:54.119
radionuclides,
at least in the lower

00:11:54.119 --> 00:11:55.840
forty-eight.
 

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.629
So the surveillance was best in
the forty-eight states.

00:11:59.629 --> 00:12:03.576
Also in Alaska,
because Alaska was the site of

00:12:03.576 --> 00:12:07.610
a variety of underground tests
by the U.S.,

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.797
but it also was the recipient
of much of the fallout that came

00:12:10.797 --> 00:12:13.153
across from Siberia,
where a number of the Soviet

00:12:13.153 --> 00:12:14.058
tests were conducted.
 

00:12:14.058 --> 00:12:18.298
So that the understanding of
the distribution of risk was

00:12:18.298 --> 00:12:22.688
really quite sophisticated,
I'd say probably more so than

00:12:22.688 --> 00:12:27.220
any other chemical that has been
studied or regulated in U.S.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.240
history.
 

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.710
So that these data were
aggregated by the National

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.259
Cancer Institute county by
county.

00:12:34.259 --> 00:12:38.605
And you can see the red pattern
indicating areas that residents

00:12:38.605 --> 00:12:43.153
received the highest exposure,
measured in milisieverts,

00:12:43.153 --> 00:12:47.979
and you also see kind of
unusual patterns developing in

00:12:47.979 --> 00:12:53.077
the Northern Rocky region,
but also as far away as

00:12:53.077 --> 00:12:56.475
Indiana, Illinois,
and then as I showed you the

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:59.178
other day,
as the cloud had swirled down

00:12:59.178 --> 00:13:02.808
from Canada and met a rainstorm
in New England,

00:13:02.808 --> 00:13:06.129
the Vermont-New York border as
well.

00:13:06.129 --> 00:13:09.320
So this became the foundation
for a rather interesting

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.450
compensation scheme on the part
of the government.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:16.479
So if you lived in specific
states or in specific counties,

00:13:16.479 --> 00:13:20.370
you were presumed to have a
certain dose of radiation.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.111
That made you eligible for
compensation at specified

00:13:24.111 --> 00:13:27.634
levels, depending upon the
illness that you could

00:13:27.634 --> 00:13:28.808
demonstrate.
 

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:31.787
So you needed a physician's
diagnosis of a particular

00:13:31.787 --> 00:13:32.360
illness.
 

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.370
It might be thyroid disease,
it could be thyroid cancer,

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.370
it could be leukemia,
it could be bone cancer,

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:44.000
it could be different types of
blood disorders.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.840
It could be genetic mutations.
 

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.684
But if you could demonstrate
that you had an illness that was

00:13:49.684 --> 00:13:53.658
plausibly related to exposure to
an array of radionuclides,

00:13:53.658 --> 00:13:57.870
it was matched up against this
map so that that became the

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.678
formula for a level of
compensation.

00:14:00.678 --> 00:14:05.528
The people that lived downwind
are called the down winders,

00:14:05.528 --> 00:14:11.190
and $50,000 became available to
those that met the criteria,

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:15.389
that were physically present,
could demonstrate that they had

00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:19.308
residency in these areas for
specific periods of time.

00:14:19.308 --> 00:14:23.054
The Radiation Exposure
Compensation Act of 1990

00:14:23.054 --> 00:14:27.370
provided for compassionate
payments to individuals who

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:32.010
contracted these cancers and
other diseases as a result of

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:35.350
exposure during the testing
period.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:40.571
And also, for those that were
mining uranium that became the

00:14:40.571 --> 00:14:45.525
predominate fuel that was
enriched to produce the nuclear

00:14:45.525 --> 00:14:49.610
fuels,
those that mined the uranium,

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.259
but also those that
transported,

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:56.807
so that the miners and the
transporters were well

00:14:56.807 --> 00:14:59.988
recognized as anther
occupational group that

00:14:59.988 --> 00:15:03.980
experienced high levels of
exposure as well as elevated

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:08.193
incidence of disease when
compared to individuals that had

00:15:08.193 --> 00:15:11.298
received lower doses of
radiation.

00:15:11.298 --> 00:15:15.793
So a payment of 75,000 was
available to people that were

00:15:15.793 --> 00:15:18.734
on-site participants,
in other words,

00:15:18.734 --> 00:15:21.918
they were actually stationed
there.

00:15:21.918 --> 00:15:25.383
The military officials that you
saw with the goggles sitting in

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:28.846
the lawn chairs with the shorts
on or those on the decks of the

00:15:28.846 --> 00:15:31.481
cruisers,
or those that actually were

00:15:31.481 --> 00:15:35.461
involved in moving into the
region and working on the boats

00:15:35.461 --> 00:15:39.100
and trying to figure out what to
do with the mess.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:43.405
So those that had participated
in restoration efforts also were

00:15:43.405 --> 00:15:44.168
eligible.
 

00:15:44.168 --> 00:15:47.438
Here's an example of a uranium
mine worker spending a good

00:15:47.438 --> 00:15:50.477
amount of time underground and
being dosed at a really

00:15:50.477 --> 00:15:52.830
significant level on a routine
basis.

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:58.259
So $100,000 was available to
those that had been employed,

00:15:58.259 --> 00:16:00.509
either above ground or below
ground,

00:16:00.509 --> 00:16:04.595
if the mines were located in
certain states and if they had

00:16:04.595 --> 00:16:08.609
worked at any time during the
period beginning in 1942 and

00:16:08.609 --> 00:16:10.298
then ending in 1971.
 

00:16:10.298 --> 00:16:13.605
So this is kind of interesting
to me, because it really is an

00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:16.908
example of the government saying
well, here's a trade off.

00:16:16.908 --> 00:16:18.710
You know, we really need to
conduct this test.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:21.808
We know that these damages are
likely to accrue.

00:16:21.808 --> 00:16:27.437
Let's develop a scientific
foundation for understanding the

00:16:27.437 --> 00:16:33.066
probability of the causal link
between the exposure and the

00:16:33.066 --> 00:16:35.590
adverse health effect.
 

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.870
And we've got to figure out a
way of compensating these

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:38.250
people.
 

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:43.456
That this is an approach
Congress thought would subvert

00:16:43.456 --> 00:16:48.470
class-action lawsuits and they
were largely right.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:50.687
My nephew is an example,
works for the Justice

00:16:50.687 --> 00:16:51.330
Department.
 

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:57.288
And he works on Native American
claims for those Native American

00:16:57.288 --> 00:17:02.678
communities that were believed
to be intensely exposed.

00:17:02.678 --> 00:17:06.902
So he goes to the community,
he interviews people using a

00:17:06.902 --> 00:17:09.240
fairly extensive survey form.
 

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:13.160
He tries to figure out their
medical condition.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.228
This is especially problematic,
you can imagine,

00:17:16.228 --> 00:17:19.362
for impoverished groups,
because they do not have

00:17:19.362 --> 00:17:21.058
adequate medical care.
 

00:17:21.058 --> 00:17:26.631
So that they also,
given the absence of routine

00:17:26.631 --> 00:17:29.076
care,
it's very common for the

00:17:29.076 --> 00:17:32.643
poorest in society to develop
illnesses that progress until

00:17:32.643 --> 00:17:35.779
they're quite serious before
they are diagnosed.

00:17:35.779 --> 00:17:39.554
So the wealthier in most
societies have access to medical

00:17:39.554 --> 00:17:42.250
care that allows for early
diagnosis,

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:45.827
early treatment,
so that the ultimate damage is

00:17:45.827 --> 00:17:48.240
often less among the wealthy.
 

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.873
It was a political science
professor who was trained at

00:17:52.873 --> 00:17:58.107
Yale and argued in an article
that being richer is being safer

00:17:58.107 --> 00:18:00.940
in the world quite generally.
 

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:04.586
So that the richer have higher
educations, they have a higher

00:18:04.586 --> 00:18:06.410
capacity to understand risk.
 

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.558
They have also a higher
capacity to take action to

00:18:09.558 --> 00:18:10.460
manage risk.
 

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.442
And in the event of damage,
they either are able to receive

00:18:14.442 --> 00:18:18.357
compensation from insurance
policies that they paid for or

00:18:18.357 --> 00:18:22.203
they have the opportunity to go
out and seek high-quality

00:18:22.203 --> 00:18:23.509
medical care.
 

00:18:23.509 --> 00:18:25.038
It's an interesting kind of an
argument.

00:18:25.038 --> 00:18:29.808
So "Richer is Safer,"
written by Aaron Wildavsky,

00:18:29.808 --> 00:18:32.630
who was a rather famous
political science professor at

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.279
the University of California.
 

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:39.660
So what's happened in terms of
these compensation efforts?

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.273
The down winders,
those that simply lived in the

00:18:42.273 --> 00:18:44.574
area,
have now received about

00:18:44.574 --> 00:18:47.282
$600,000, or excuse me,
$600,000,000,

00:18:47.282 --> 00:18:49.950
about 12,000 different claims
have been approved.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.788
The on-site participants have
been awarded about $91,000,000.

00:18:53.788 --> 00:18:58.597
The uranium miners and the
millers have received about

00:18:58.597 --> 00:19:03.858
$600,000,000 and the ore
transporters about $24,000,000.

00:19:03.858 --> 00:19:09.717
So a total of about 20,000
people have been compensated at

00:19:09.717 --> 00:19:12.390
a level of $1.3 billion.
 

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:15.160
Now, back up and think.
 

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:19.000
Well, how many people actually
were exposed during this period

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:19.630
of time?
 

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:23.959
Well, the Cancer Institute did
an estimate, which was rather

00:19:23.959 --> 00:19:24.838
revealing.
 

00:19:24.838 --> 00:19:29.420
By studying tissue samples from
around the world,

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:33.686
their estimate by the
mid-1990s, when the total world

00:19:33.686 --> 00:19:37.780
population was roughly 5.6,
5.7 billion people,

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:42.759
their estimate of those exposed
was 5 billion people in the

00:19:42.759 --> 00:19:44.220
world exposed.
 

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:49.125
So any sort of a compensatory
scheme such as this would have

00:19:49.125 --> 00:19:52.950
to set boundaries,
would have to set limits.

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:56.834
And our limits were set at our
national border despite the fact

00:19:56.834 --> 00:20:00.593
that we contaminated tracts of
land in different parts of the

00:20:00.593 --> 00:20:01.220
world.
 

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:07.240
And it was not as easily
predicted as you might imagine,

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.155
given the role that climate
played relative to the

00:20:10.155 --> 00:20:13.368
intersection of the rainstorms
with the dust clouds.

00:20:13.368 --> 00:20:16.638
And also the long residency
time of the radionuclides in the

00:20:16.638 --> 00:20:17.358
atmosphere.
 

00:20:17.358 --> 00:20:20.234
So that Mexico,
Canada, parts of Europe,

00:20:20.234 --> 00:20:23.996
were very heavily exposed,
but they did not have any

00:20:23.996 --> 00:20:26.430
compensation scheme in place.
 

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:32.058
Now I'd like to switch gears
for a moment and talk briefly

00:20:32.058 --> 00:20:35.220
about medical experimentation.
 

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:40.085
And you may recall from earlier
history courses that the

00:20:40.085 --> 00:20:45.214
Nuremberg Trial in 1946 produced
eventually consensus about

00:20:45.214 --> 00:20:49.548
ethical guidelines for human
experimentation.

00:20:49.548 --> 00:20:54.979
Well, the Nazis were quite
active at experimenting on

00:20:54.979 --> 00:21:00.617
humans and violating most
principles that now have been

00:21:00.617 --> 00:21:04.900
adopted by nations or among
nations,

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.455
and also principles that have
been adopted by medical

00:21:07.455 --> 00:21:09.028
associations around the world.
 

00:21:09.028 --> 00:21:14.578
So the Nuremberg Trial was
conducted in reaction to

00:21:14.578 --> 00:21:20.348
horrific experimentation without
seeking consent,

00:21:20.348 --> 00:21:24.778
without providing knowledge
about what the purpose was,

00:21:24.778 --> 00:21:28.930
what the risks might be,
without anesthesia.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:34.384
So that there was no sense of
what the humanitarian benefit

00:21:34.384 --> 00:21:35.420
might be.
 

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:39.509
And also, kind of raising a
rather interesting question,

00:21:39.509 --> 00:21:41.990
when you think about medical
experimentation,

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:47.030
how should you conceive of the
locus of the balancing that

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:48.269
would go on?
 

00:21:48.269 --> 00:21:52.343
You know, a fundamental
principle of medicine is the

00:21:52.343 --> 00:21:54.900
first principle is do no harm.
 

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.328
Well, experimentation may do
harm.

00:21:57.328 --> 00:22:00.410
If you conduct a clinical trial
using a new drug,

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:02.338
or you wonder about a new
technology,

00:22:02.338 --> 00:22:06.394
such as a nuclear weapon or
exposure to waste from a nuclear

00:22:06.394 --> 00:22:09.346
reactor,
then you need to think about

00:22:09.346 --> 00:22:12.880
what the net benefit to the
person might be.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.085
Is it okay to think about this
question as one where the

00:22:17.085 --> 00:22:21.750
individual that is exposed
deliberately in the experiment,

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:25.858
whether or not the net benefit
should be balanced against the

00:22:25.858 --> 00:22:27.230
individual damage.
 

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:30.586
In other words,
is it ethically responsible to

00:22:30.586 --> 00:22:34.989
think that a collective benefit
in terms of making the world

00:22:34.989 --> 00:22:36.887
safer,
if you believe that,

00:22:36.887 --> 00:22:40.179
by experimenting with nuclear
weapons and trying to figure out

00:22:40.179 --> 00:22:43.970
what our resiliency would be,
does it make sense to balance

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:48.058
that against harm that would be
accrued by the individual?

00:22:48.058 --> 00:22:53.604
So that now when we think about
the design and license of a new

00:22:53.604 --> 00:22:56.508
drug,
we construct the calculus of

00:22:56.508 --> 00:23:01.432
good versus harm at the level of
the individual as opposed to at

00:23:01.432 --> 00:23:03.308
the level of society.
 

00:23:03.308 --> 00:23:06.035
So for years,
I debated with chemical

00:23:06.035 --> 00:23:10.500
industry officials about the
ethical nature of claiming that

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:14.663
it's okay for us to be exposed
to pesticides in food and

00:23:14.663 --> 00:23:18.903
drinking water or the farm
workers breathing the fumes in

00:23:18.903 --> 00:23:21.778
the air as a plane flies over.
 

00:23:21.778 --> 00:23:24.273
There's a case that we'll talk
about more next-- over the next

00:23:24.273 --> 00:23:25.009
couple of weeks.
 

00:23:25.009 --> 00:23:28.346
Is it okay to justify that
based on the claim that well,

00:23:28.346 --> 00:23:31.442
you know, if you use
pesticides, then we're going to

00:23:31.442 --> 00:23:33.930
produce a lot more food in the
world?

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.720
So that we'll avoid starvation,
we'll avoid diseases.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.502
So that's an example where you
conduct the calculus at a very

00:23:40.502 --> 00:23:43.284
gross scale,
saying yes, the population is

00:23:43.284 --> 00:23:46.637
exposed to these chemicals at
relatively low levels in

00:23:46.637 --> 00:23:49.953
drinking water and food,
occupationally at a higher

00:23:49.953 --> 00:23:50.368
level.
 

00:23:50.368 --> 00:23:52.978
But it's really worth it,
because we want to balance that

00:23:52.978 --> 00:23:55.632
over the net collective benefit
of having a nutritious and

00:23:55.632 --> 00:23:56.890
sufficient food supply.
 

00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:02.969
So that these are the basic
questions that were addressed in

00:24:02.969 --> 00:24:07.940
the Nuremberg trial,
but also surround the question

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.578
about how to manage compensation
efforts.

00:24:11.578 --> 00:24:15.338
So twenty-three medical doctors
were on trial for murder,

00:24:15.338 --> 00:24:19.960
torture, and other atrocities
performed in the broad name,

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.849
in their testimony,
of medical science in

00:24:22.849 --> 00:24:24.440
concentration camps.
 

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.201
Now, in response to this,
the American Medical

00:24:27.201 --> 00:24:30.942
Association eventually adopted
guidelines that included these:

00:24:30.942 --> 00:24:34.380
voluntary and understanding
consent of the subject,

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:39.094
prior animal experimentation,
appropriate medical

00:24:39.094 --> 00:24:40.470
supervision.
 

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:44.749
Those treated were expected to
accrue some benefit or there

00:24:44.749 --> 00:24:48.732
should be some overwhelming
humanitarian purpose that's

00:24:48.732 --> 00:24:53.529
served if the benefit would not
be accrued by the individual.

00:24:53.529 --> 00:24:57.500
So thinking about these
guidelines and then thinking

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:01.781
about the Atomic Energy
Commission's approach themselves

00:25:01.781 --> 00:25:06.220
to experimenting with humans is
an interesting topic.

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.667
And if you go back and take a
look at the Department of Energy

00:25:08.667 --> 00:25:11.075
files,
which you can do on their

00:25:11.075 --> 00:25:15.984
website if you simply take a
look at the release of documents

00:25:15.984 --> 00:25:20.154
that occurred during the 1990s,
many of which had been

00:25:20.154 --> 00:25:23.298
classified, you'll see a whole
array of experiments.

00:25:23.298 --> 00:25:27.260
Here's an example of isotope
injections at Brookhaven

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.181
National Lab,
where the individual being

00:25:30.181 --> 00:25:34.240
injected had no knowledge of
what he was being injected with.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.211
No understanding of the
radioactive tracers that were

00:25:38.211 --> 00:25:42.717
being used to understand how
these compounds get distributed

00:25:42.717 --> 00:25:43.940
in the body.
 

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:48.680
So I mean, one of the concerns
at that point in time was,

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.250
we're releasing this
technology, we're creating all

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:54.244
these new radionuclides,
how do they behave inside the

00:25:54.244 --> 00:25:54.910
human body?
 

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:59.301
Well, we all know that
radioactive tracers now are used

00:25:59.301 --> 00:26:03.856
to track the movement of
different pharmaceuticals to the

00:26:03.856 --> 00:26:08.493
body to make sure that they can
reach the target organ and

00:26:08.493 --> 00:26:13.049
actually cure an illness or a
particular problem,

00:26:13.049 --> 00:26:15.130
such as a bacterial infection.
 

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:18.798
So that being able to
understand the movement of

00:26:18.798 --> 00:26:22.234
chemicals through the body,
where they reside,

00:26:22.234 --> 00:26:26.397
what their persistence is,
what their metabolic rate is,

00:26:26.397 --> 00:26:31.230
how they break down into other
products and whether or not

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:36.403
those are likely to be excreted
by urine and feces or excreted

00:26:36.403 --> 00:26:39.538
by water vapor from your breath.
 

00:26:39.538 --> 00:26:43.327
So these are all questions that
are circulating in their minds

00:26:43.327 --> 00:26:47.178
and provided in their thinking a
rationale for experimenting on

00:26:47.178 --> 00:26:50.160
humans without asking for their
permission,

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.380
without telling them the logic
behind it,

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:56.269
and with no presumption that
the individual would benefit

00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:57.730
from that exposure.
 

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:01.255
So eighty-one studies were
conducted that involved

00:27:01.255 --> 00:27:05.429
children's participation or
participation by pregnant women

00:27:05.429 --> 00:27:07.298
in radiation research.
 

00:27:07.298 --> 00:27:10.182
Twenty-one of these were
supported by federal funds

00:27:10.182 --> 00:27:12.200
determined to be
non-therapeutic.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.249
In other words,
no benefit would accrue to the

00:27:15.249 --> 00:27:17.348
individual that participated.
 

00:27:17.348 --> 00:27:21.904
Now also think about this and
think about the logic of

00:27:21.904 --> 00:27:26.718
employing children and whether
or not it is reasonable to

00:27:26.718 --> 00:27:31.875
assume that a child would have
the capacity to understand the

00:27:31.875 --> 00:27:35.769
nature of the risk,
to understand the perceived

00:27:35.769 --> 00:27:39.210
humanitarian benefit of
participating in the research,

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:43.522
and also to be capable of
self-monitoring for

00:27:43.522 --> 00:27:48.817
physiological effects that might
be associated with the

00:27:48.817 --> 00:27:50.190
exposures.
 

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:53.284
So by the way,
we fall down in this

00:27:53.284 --> 00:27:58.106
expectation that children
somehow should be capable of

00:27:58.106 --> 00:28:02.384
understanding risks via
education or via product

00:28:02.384 --> 00:28:03.750
labeling.
 

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:07.145
Whereas, there are 80,000,000
children in the United States

00:28:07.145 --> 00:28:10.541
today that really have quite
limited capacity to understand

00:28:10.541 --> 00:28:13.470
the nature of the kinds of
environmental threats or

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:16.807
environmental health threats
that we've been discussing so

00:28:16.807 --> 00:28:18.328
far in the course.
 

00:28:18.328 --> 00:28:21.440
Now that to me is quite
interesting.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:26.142
If you choose to educate or to
label as a management strategy

00:28:26.142 --> 00:28:30.296
to contain risk or to manage a
technological hazard or

00:28:30.296 --> 00:28:34.061
pollution --
another good example of that

00:28:34.061 --> 00:28:38.009
would be the way we manage
mercury in fish.

00:28:38.009 --> 00:28:40.781
We don't set a limit for
mercury in fish and then take

00:28:40.781 --> 00:28:43.762
mercury, or take the fish that
are contaminated beyond the

00:28:43.762 --> 00:28:45.490
limit out of the marketplace.
 

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.640
Instead, what do we do?
 

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.836
We post signs on the side of a
riverbank or on the side of a

00:28:50.836 --> 00:28:54.140
lake, and assume that that sign
is going to be sufficient as a

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.170
warning device.
 

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:58.583
Do not consume more than X
amount of fish taken from this

00:28:58.583 --> 00:29:02.180
river, the logic being to
contain their mercury exposure.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:06.336
So the idea that you've got a
large proportion of the public

00:29:06.336 --> 00:29:09.980
that is either illiterate,
that is not technically

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:14.085
competent in order to understand
the technical nature of the

00:29:14.085 --> 00:29:17.744
warning,
or not capable of managing

00:29:17.744 --> 00:29:23.180
their own health in response to
an adverse event.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:26.483
So here are a couple of
examples of the way that the

00:29:26.483 --> 00:29:29.788
Atomic Energy Commission was
thinking about this.

00:29:29.788 --> 00:29:34.247
Here, the AEC medical advisor
is recommending the suppression

00:29:34.247 --> 00:29:37.068
of evidence of plutonium
injections.

00:29:37.068 --> 00:29:41.328
So not informing people that
are part of experiments.

00:29:41.328 --> 00:29:44.701
"There are a large number
of papers (he argued) that do

00:29:44.701 --> 00:29:47.844
not violate national security,
but do cause considerable

00:29:47.844 --> 00:29:48.529
concern.
 

00:29:48.529 --> 00:29:51.266
Papers referring to levels of
soil and water contamination

00:29:51.266 --> 00:29:54.885
surrounding AEC installations,
idle speculation on the future

00:29:54.885 --> 00:29:58.207
genetic effects of radiation,
and papers dealing with

00:29:58.207 --> 00:30:00.959
potential process hazards to
employees are definitely

00:30:00.959 --> 00:30:03.868
prejudicial to the best
interests of the government.

00:30:03.868 --> 00:30:06.837
Every such release is reflected
in an increase in insurance

00:30:06.837 --> 00:30:09.096
claims,
increased difficulty in labor

00:30:09.096 --> 00:30:10.884
relations,
and adverse public

00:30:10.884 --> 00:30:11.890
sentiment."
 

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:13.730
Very, very curious.
 

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:18.358
So they're arguing that a logic
for secrecy, a logic for not

00:30:18.358 --> 00:30:23.067
seeing informed consent is that
it's going to make their life

00:30:23.067 --> 00:30:24.009
tougher.
 

00:30:24.009 --> 00:30:27.549
You could use the same argument
to basically scuttle a

00:30:27.549 --> 00:30:29.019
surveillance system.
 

00:30:29.019 --> 00:30:31.712
So basically argue,
well, let's not monitor where

00:30:31.712 --> 00:30:33.729
this stuff goes,
because if we do then

00:30:33.729 --> 00:30:36.306
somebody's going to find out
about it and it could be used

00:30:36.306 --> 00:30:36.940
against us.
 

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:41.603
It could foster public opinion
that would cause Congress to

00:30:41.603 --> 00:30:44.900
react to their constituency and
argue,

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:46.678
gee, you know,
we shouldn't continue with this

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:47.390
testing program.
 

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:50.211
So they're very deeply into
this line of logic trying to

00:30:50.211 --> 00:30:52.828
figure out how they can maintain
public support,

00:30:52.828 --> 00:30:56.443
but how the very act of
conducting surveillance or

00:30:56.443 --> 00:31:01.240
environmental monitoring could
undermine their long-term plans.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:05.650
In another example,
at Vanderbilt Hospital between

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:10.960
1945 and 1947,829 pregnant women
were fed radioactive tracer

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.220
cocktails.
 

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.949
Another at the University of
Tennessee at the College of

00:31:15.949 --> 00:31:18.730
Medicine and the John Gaston
Hospital,

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:22.675
two African American women ages
twenty-two and thirty-three were

00:31:22.675 --> 00:31:26.372
administered iodine-131 while
they were nursing infants four

00:31:26.372 --> 00:31:27.500
months in age.
 

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.440
And both mothers had been
diagnosed with thyroid cancer.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.500
This is curious.
 

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:36.176
You take mothers that had
thyroid cancer and you would

00:31:36.176 --> 00:31:39.646
dose them with iodine,
which lodges in the thyroid,

00:31:39.646 --> 00:31:41.660
that had been irradiated.
 

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:45.608
Infants continued to nurse,
and levels of iodine-131 were

00:31:45.608 --> 00:31:49.064
monitored in the mothers' breast
milk and thyroid,

00:31:49.064 --> 00:31:51.108
and the infants' thyroid.
 

00:31:51.108 --> 00:31:54.740
The infants' accumulation of
iodine-131 in their thyroids was

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:57.065
significant,
prompting the researchers to

00:31:57.065 --> 00:32:00.200
warn against administration of
iodine-131 to lactating women.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:05.560
So the thinking here that they
understood clearly that the

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:09.230
nuclide moved from mom to the
young,

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:14.414
to the kids via breast milk,
but they really had no concerns

00:32:14.414 --> 00:32:20.038
about what the long-term health
effects might be on the women.

00:32:20.038 --> 00:32:23.192
At Harvard, Boston University,
and Massachusetts General

00:32:23.192 --> 00:32:25.413
Hospital,
there was an experiment

00:32:25.413 --> 00:32:28.813
conducted on what they then
called mentally retarded

00:32:28.813 --> 00:32:32.078
children in 1961 at the Wrentham
State School.

00:32:32.078 --> 00:32:34.782
And it was designed to
understand whether

00:32:34.782 --> 00:32:38.162
nonradioactive iodine could
block thyroid uptake of

00:32:38.162 --> 00:32:40.730
radioactive iodine,
or iodine-131.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:47.041
The National Institute of
Health, the Atomic Energy

00:32:47.041 --> 00:32:50.569
Commission,
and the Quaker Oats Company

00:32:50.569 --> 00:32:54.546
also conducted a similar study
at the Walter Fernald School in

00:32:54.546 --> 00:32:57.627
Massachusetts,
also described by the AEC as

00:32:57.627 --> 00:33:01.308
being a school for the
"mentally retarded."

00:33:01.308 --> 00:33:04.217
And the children were fed
breakfast food containing

00:33:04.217 --> 00:33:06.019
radioactive iron and calcium.
 

00:33:06.019 --> 00:33:07.440
The Quaker Oats Company?
 

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.680
Now that's interesting.
 

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.342
Quaker Oats was extremely
concerned about contaminates

00:33:12.342 --> 00:33:14.828
moving into their processed
foods.

00:33:14.828 --> 00:33:18.229
And they were also worried
about whether or not they might

00:33:18.229 --> 00:33:21.925
be able to block the uptake of
some radionuclides by fortifying

00:33:21.925 --> 00:33:24.608
some of their foods with other
nutrients.

00:33:24.608 --> 00:33:29.509
So could you put calcium in
oatmeal, and would that have an

00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:30.269
effect?
 

00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:33.769
Well, perhaps that's an
interesting study.

00:33:33.769 --> 00:33:38.316
Perhaps you would want to carry
that study out on animals before

00:33:38.316 --> 00:33:40.410
you conduct it on children.
 

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:46.082
And why would you choose the
Wrentham School or the Fernald

00:33:46.082 --> 00:33:50.190
School as a locus of this type
of study?

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:53.688
So nine boys between ten and
fifteen years in age and one

00:33:53.688 --> 00:33:56.250
twenty-one year old served as
subjects.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.779
And they were divided into two
groups,

00:33:57.779 --> 00:34:01.088
one receiving intravenous
injections of calcium-45,

00:34:01.088 --> 00:34:03.329
and the others received it
orally in their breakfast

00:34:03.329 --> 00:34:03.769
cereals.
 

00:34:03.769 --> 00:34:08.882
And they were trying to figure
out where this went in the human

00:34:08.882 --> 00:34:13.418
body and what role it played in
blocking uptake of other

00:34:13.418 --> 00:34:14.489
nuclides.
 

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:17.418
And several letters were sent
to the parents of the students,

00:34:17.418 --> 00:34:20.398
who would become members of the
Science Club if they agreed to

00:34:20.398 --> 00:34:21.179
participate.
 

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:23.865
So the first appeal was made to
the students,

00:34:23.865 --> 00:34:25.820
would you like to participate?
 

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:29.034
And it's kind of interesting to
think about the letter that was

00:34:29.034 --> 00:34:31.525
sent to the parents,
so I'm going to read this to

00:34:31.525 --> 00:34:31.940
you.
 

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.817
It gives you some insight into
their thinking and their

00:34:34.817 --> 00:34:35.349
methods.
 

00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:37.768
"Dear Parent:
In previous years,

00:34:37.768 --> 00:34:40.211
we have done some examination
in connection with the

00:34:40.211 --> 00:34:42.847
nutritional department of the
Massachusetts Institute of

00:34:42.847 --> 00:34:45.864
Technology with the purposes of
helping to improve the nutrition

00:34:45.864 --> 00:34:48.260
of our children and to help them
in general.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:52.092
And for checking up on the
children, we occasionally need

00:34:52.092 --> 00:34:55.719
to take some blood samples which
are then analyzed.

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:58.404
The blood samples are taken
after one test meal which

00:34:58.404 --> 00:35:01.655
consists of a special breakfast
meal containing a certain amount

00:35:01.655 --> 00:35:02.429
of calcium.
 

00:35:02.429 --> 00:35:05.954
(No mention of the
radionuclide) We have asked for

00:35:05.954 --> 00:35:10.126
volunteers to give a sample of
blood once a month for three

00:35:10.126 --> 00:35:12.262
months,
and your son has agreed to

00:35:12.262 --> 00:35:14.454
volunteer,
because the boys who belong to

00:35:14.454 --> 00:35:17.130
the Science Club have many
additional privileges.

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:20.590
They get a quart of milk daily
during that time,

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.739
they're taken to a baseball
game, to the beach,

00:35:22.739 --> 00:35:26.570
and to some outside dinners,
and they enjoy it greatly.

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:29.018
I hope that you have no
objection that your son is

00:35:29.018 --> 00:35:31.119
voluntarily participating in
this study.

00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:33.550
The first study will start on
Monday,

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:36.949
June 8, and if you have not
expressed any objections,

00:35:36.949 --> 00:35:39.079
we will assume that your son
may participate."

00:35:39.079 --> 00:35:40.960
Interesting.
 

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:48.166
So first, the presumption that
they would legitimately ask the

00:35:48.166 --> 00:35:51.239
child before the parent.
 

00:35:51.239 --> 00:35:54.139
The presumption that if they
heard nothing back from the

00:35:54.139 --> 00:35:57.356
parent, who might be traveling
or whatever, that they would go

00:35:57.356 --> 00:35:58.940
ahead with the experiment.
 

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:03.387
So these studies,
once they were released and

00:36:03.387 --> 00:36:08.644
came to the attention of the
Department of Energy and

00:36:08.644 --> 00:36:14.769
President Clinton in 1995,
led the administration to issue

00:36:14.769 --> 00:36:18.630
an executive order on
declassification.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:22.806
So during the 1990s,
the Clinton Administration was

00:36:22.806 --> 00:36:27.483
responsible for declassifying
almost 400,000,000 pages of

00:36:27.483 --> 00:36:28.570
material.
 

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:34.309
Twenty percent or so reduction
in the total backlog,

00:36:34.309 --> 00:36:42.206
but the new classification
programs have been initiated by

00:36:42.206 --> 00:36:44.789
the CIA,
the National Security Agency,

00:36:44.789 --> 00:36:46.250
and the National Reconnaissance
Office.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:50.519
So that this period between
1990 and 2000 was a period where

00:36:50.519 --> 00:36:54.429
we were declassifying more than
we were classifying.

00:36:54.429 --> 00:36:58.164
And following 2001,
September 11th attack on the

00:36:58.164 --> 00:37:01.661
World Trade Center,
we've clearly gone in the

00:37:01.661 --> 00:37:03.489
opposite direction.
 

00:37:03.489 --> 00:37:08.030
The Department of Energy was
extremely embarrassed by the

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:10.219
release of these studies.
 

00:37:10.219 --> 00:37:15.610
And the former Secretary,
Hazel O'Leary,

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:18.940
undertook what she called an
Openness Initiative in 1993 and

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:22.103
went back through all of her
records of the Atomic Energy

00:37:22.103 --> 00:37:22.949
Commission.
 

00:37:22.949 --> 00:37:27.173
And once that was transformed
into the Department of Energy,

00:37:27.173 --> 00:37:30.898
the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, and declassified a

00:37:30.898 --> 00:37:33.190
large amount of information.
 

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:36.983
The National Security
Administration is now the

00:37:36.983 --> 00:37:40.530
largest intelligence agency in
the world.

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:45.831
And it is important to know
that they have power to classify

00:37:45.831 --> 00:37:47.268
at all levels.
 

00:37:47.268 --> 00:37:50.541
And they also are exempt from
the federal Freedom of

00:37:50.541 --> 00:37:53.300
Information Act,
which means that you cannot

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.739
request any information from
them.

00:37:55.739 --> 00:38:00.715
Or they have the ability to
make the judgment to decline any

00:38:00.715 --> 00:38:04.679
request and not give you any
reason for that.

00:38:04.679 --> 00:38:08.282
So last year,
we spent-- this is actually a

00:38:08.282 --> 00:38:12.914
year and a half old now,
we spent almost $25 billion on

00:38:12.914 --> 00:38:14.630
Secret Programs.
 

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:17.295
Secret programs for
surveillance,

00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:21.853
for containment,
technologies to eavesdrop via

00:38:21.853 --> 00:38:26.414
computer reading emails,
also watching the way that

00:38:26.414 --> 00:38:28.309
people surf the internet.
 

00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:30.753
So that the surveillance
efforts on the part of the

00:38:30.753 --> 00:38:33.101
government that remain
classified have never been

00:38:33.101 --> 00:38:34.469
higher in human history.
 

00:38:34.469 --> 00:38:39.577
So let's pause and reflect over
the past couple of lectures and

00:38:39.577 --> 00:38:42.710
think about some of the key
lessons.

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:46.909
One lesson that is extremely
important,

00:38:46.909 --> 00:38:49.079
and I hope five years down the
road,

00:38:49.079 --> 00:38:52.851
if you have- if I have any hope
of you remember anything about

00:38:52.851 --> 00:38:55.858
this course,
I want you to think about one

00:38:55.858 --> 00:38:56.360
issue.
 

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.382
And that is,
if you want to manage the

00:38:58.382 --> 00:39:01.664
environment, you've got to think
a lot about the principle of

00:39:01.664 --> 00:39:02.539
persistence.
 

00:39:02.539 --> 00:39:05.369
How long does a danger persist?
 

00:39:05.369 --> 00:39:07.639
How is it distributed?
 

00:39:07.639 --> 00:39:10.710
How does it move through the
environment?

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:12.742
The atmosphere,
the water, the soils,

00:39:12.742 --> 00:39:13.590
and the food?
 

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:16.436
And I'm struck,
I'm really struck by the

00:39:16.436 --> 00:39:20.599
importance of food as being a
primary route of exposure to

00:39:20.599 --> 00:39:23.739
many of the radionuclides in
this case.

00:39:23.739 --> 00:39:27.672
But it's also the primary route
of exposure to many pollutants

00:39:27.672 --> 00:39:31.349
and other synthetic chemicals in
the food supply today.

00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:36.021
I gave a lecture yesterday
afternoon on regulation of food

00:39:36.021 --> 00:39:40.233
in the United States,
and I came to the conclusion

00:39:40.233 --> 00:39:44.559
that food is often the
predominate route of exposure.

00:39:44.559 --> 00:39:47.592
And you often need to think
about controlling air pollution

00:39:47.592 --> 00:39:50.260
because of how it might get into
the food supply.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:55.833
So really, the strontium-90
story, the iodine-131 story,

00:39:55.833 --> 00:40:00.900
and also the cesium story as
well, is one about air

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:02.320
pollution.
 

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.320
It's about having the idea that
it's okay to release this

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:08.699
material to the environment and
that it's not going to come back

00:40:08.699 --> 00:40:12.130
to haunt us in the form of water
pollution or air pollution.

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:15.744
But where it seems to pose the
greatest amount of threat,

00:40:15.744 --> 00:40:19.230
where it concentrates the most
is in the food chain.

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:23.016
So if it gets into the
atmosphere, it's likely to get

00:40:23.016 --> 00:40:26.730
into every other compartment of
the environment,

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:30.844
and then it's likely to
boomerang back to us in the form

00:40:30.844 --> 00:40:32.639
of a food contaminate.
 

00:40:32.639 --> 00:40:38.360
This case demonstrated also the
length of time,

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.164
the enormous amount of science
that needed to be conducted in

00:40:41.164 --> 00:40:44.108
order to figure out what happens
to these chemicals in the human

00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:44.530
body.
 

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:48.121
Yes, you could think from a
medical researcher's perspective

00:40:48.121 --> 00:40:51.469
that it was legitimate to think
about the need for human

00:40:51.469 --> 00:40:55.121
experimentation to figure out
where these compounds go in the

00:40:55.121 --> 00:40:58.532
human body and also to think
about the need for long-term

00:40:58.532 --> 00:41:02.306
medical surveillance to figure
out what the effects of exposure

00:41:02.306 --> 00:41:04.619
at different doses might be.
 

00:41:04.619 --> 00:41:08.268
But there are experimental
guidelines that you could now

00:41:08.268 --> 00:41:12.048
imagine that you would want in
place before the government

00:41:12.048 --> 00:41:15.829
would have authority to conduct
those types of tests.

00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:19.789
This is a case,
probably the best case in the

00:41:19.789 --> 00:41:23.913
history that we've got,
the history of environmental

00:41:23.913 --> 00:41:26.610
science,
about expert understanding of a

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:31.465
dose-response relationship,
understanding what dose posed a

00:41:31.465 --> 00:41:33.070
specific threat.
 

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:36.748
And also, it is perhaps the
first case in the United States

00:41:36.748 --> 00:41:39.335
at least,
where we had an understanding

00:41:39.335 --> 00:41:43.050
that these chemicals behave very
differently in the fetus.

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:47.320
They behave very differently in
people that have different

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.268
genetic characteristics.
 

00:41:49.268 --> 00:41:52.465
They behave differently in the
young compared to the old,

00:41:52.465 --> 00:41:55.775
and that they concentrate in
different parts of the body at

00:41:55.775 --> 00:41:56.860
different ages.
 

00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:01.494
So this idea of susceptibility
that now has become a hallmark

00:42:01.494 --> 00:42:02.190
of U.S.
 

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:04.599
environmental law and really a
fundamental principle of

00:42:04.599 --> 00:42:07.476
European environmental law,
looking and thinking about

00:42:07.476 --> 00:42:10.961
everybody as not being average
but looking at differences in

00:42:10.961 --> 00:42:13.679
physiology and these other
characteristics.

00:42:13.679 --> 00:42:18.003
Susceptibility is now an
extremely important factor in

00:42:18.003 --> 00:42:21.576
thinking about risk,
and therefore becomes a

00:42:21.576 --> 00:42:26.222
critical foundation for thinking
about different risk management

00:42:26.222 --> 00:42:29.289
strategies,
like setting levels for

00:42:29.289 --> 00:42:33.300
allowable contamination in air,
food, and water.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:38.264
Don't forget in this case as
well that this entire history

00:42:38.264 --> 00:42:42.032
took place between '46,
1945, actually,

00:42:42.032 --> 00:42:44.739
the first test,
and 1963,

00:42:44.739 --> 00:42:49.675
when the atmospheric testing
stopped by the Limited Test Ban

00:42:49.675 --> 00:42:50.429
Treaty.
 

00:42:50.429 --> 00:42:52.840
So in this compressed
eighteen-year period.

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:57.201
What environmental laws did we
have in place to control

00:42:57.201 --> 00:42:58.090
exposure?
 

00:42:58.090 --> 00:42:59.518
We had nothing.
 

00:42:59.518 --> 00:43:02.213
We had no Clean Air Act,
we had no Safe Drinking Water

00:43:02.213 --> 00:43:04.217
Act,
we had no Toxic Substance

00:43:04.217 --> 00:43:06.617
Control Act,
we had no Superfund Act to try

00:43:06.617 --> 00:43:09.719
to figure out what to do with
these highly contaminated sites.

00:43:09.719 --> 00:43:12.126
We had no Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act that

00:43:12.126 --> 00:43:15.119
looked at radionuclide levels in
different foods.

00:43:15.119 --> 00:43:18.751
We had no Food and Drug
Administration that might be

00:43:18.751 --> 00:43:22.954
responsible for looking for
radionuclides in different types

00:43:22.954 --> 00:43:23.880
of foods.
 

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:28.268
We had no understanding of
whether or not the chemicals

00:43:28.268 --> 00:43:33.061
bio-concentrated during the
process of taking a raw corn and

00:43:33.061 --> 00:43:37.612
turning it into corn oil or
extracting the water out of a

00:43:37.612 --> 00:43:39.969
grape to make a raisin.
 

00:43:39.969 --> 00:43:43.779
So that none of this regulatory
authority existed during this

00:43:43.779 --> 00:43:45.239
eighteen-year period.
 

00:43:45.239 --> 00:43:49.175
So at the same time,
what we'll see over the next

00:43:49.175 --> 00:43:53.768
several weeks is that this
history is extremely important

00:43:53.768 --> 00:43:58.197
in providing a paradigm for
understanding environmental

00:43:58.197 --> 00:44:03.364
quality and the distribution of
pollution that was picked up and

00:44:03.364 --> 00:44:06.809
was dropped into food safety
law,

00:44:06.809 --> 00:44:09.949
dropped into air quality law,
dropped into thinking about

00:44:09.949 --> 00:44:11.800
hazardous materials management.
 

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:16.369
So it's become a very important
component of environmental law.

00:44:16.369 --> 00:44:21.038
Also later in the term,
when we think about the current

00:44:21.038 --> 00:44:24.670
status and the future of nuclear
power,

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:28.157
we're not going to move into
this discussion too deeply

00:44:28.157 --> 00:44:31.617
today,
but I want you to think about

00:44:31.617 --> 00:44:36.480
the similarity between what we
learned by 1963,

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.679
and then what we learned from
the Chernobyl event.

00:44:38.679 --> 00:44:44.304
So, Chernobyl is a nuclear
reactor located just outside of

00:44:44.304 --> 00:44:48.449
Kiev in a little village called
Pripyat.

00:44:48.449 --> 00:44:51.849
And it exploded and it caught
on fire.

00:44:51.849 --> 00:44:55.429
And the roof blew off of it
back in 1986.

00:44:55.429 --> 00:44:57.344
And I don't know,
well let's see,

00:44:57.344 --> 00:45:00.936
1986, I suppose that most of
you would not have been alive in

00:45:00.936 --> 00:45:03.750
1986, but your parents would
remember this.

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:06.824
And you are walking around
probably still with

00:45:06.824 --> 00:45:10.855
radionuclides in your body that
resulted from your intake of

00:45:10.855 --> 00:45:14.817
foods that were contaminated as
the amount of material that

00:45:14.817 --> 00:45:19.190
reached the atmosphere also went
into global circulation,

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:23.340
also rained down around the
world and exposed almost

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:27.896
everyone at a lower level than
was experienced during the

00:45:27.896 --> 00:45:30.420
atomic weapons testing era.
 

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:34.130
A couple of key points of
comparison here.

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:37.485
One is that the expectation on
the part of the Soviet

00:45:37.485 --> 00:45:40.137
government,
then responsible for managing

00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:43.199
this site,
was that they needed to manage

00:45:43.199 --> 00:45:47.880
and test for contamination in
close proximity to that site.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:51.228
They were most worried about
getting people out of that zone

00:45:51.228 --> 00:45:54.577
by evacuating them out within
roughly about a ten to fifteen

00:45:54.577 --> 00:45:55.768
kilometer radius.
 

00:45:55.768 --> 00:45:59.518
If you remember that donut,
remember the donut that I had

00:45:59.518 --> 00:46:03.735
up there surrounding the map in
Nevada that demonstrated the way

00:46:03.735 --> 00:46:06.815
that the Atomic Energy
Commission had similarly

00:46:06.815 --> 00:46:10.230
underestimated the movement of
radionuclides.

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:12.239
The same happened here.
 

00:46:12.239 --> 00:46:15.210
Gradually, after they expanded
their testing,

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:19.099
they found that the eventual
distributional pattern is

00:46:19.099 --> 00:46:23.063
designated by the red on this
map as the most intensely

00:46:23.063 --> 00:46:24.679
contaminated zone.
 

00:46:24.679 --> 00:46:29.277
So if you look at this,
you see that certain of these

00:46:29.277 --> 00:46:31.489
zones were confiscated.
 

00:46:31.489 --> 00:46:35.936
Some were confiscated even more
than 150 miles away from the

00:46:35.936 --> 00:46:37.369
site of the fire.
 

00:46:37.369 --> 00:46:41.708
There is a very important story
here about the absence of

00:46:41.708 --> 00:46:45.737
surveillance leading to a
perception of environmental

00:46:45.737 --> 00:46:46.590
purity.
 

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:49.500
So that gradually over a period
of time,

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:52.271
you know, as the Soviet Union
collapsed and the amount of

00:46:52.271 --> 00:46:55.110
surveillance expanded,
the quality of the testing got

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.445
better,
they realized that these

00:46:57.445 --> 00:47:01.311
nuclides had seriously
contaminated a huge tract of

00:47:01.311 --> 00:47:04.789
landscape in the eastern
European nations.

00:47:04.789 --> 00:47:08.929
And they basically made
agricultural productivity

00:47:08.929 --> 00:47:10.050
impossible.
 

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:13.010
They made future forestry in
this area impossible.

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:17.690
The forests surrounding Kiev
now have taken up the

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:19.219
radionuclides.
 

00:47:19.219 --> 00:47:22.559
So if you cut those down and
you build a house of the

00:47:22.559 --> 00:47:25.449
material, you basically would be
exposing you,

00:47:25.449 --> 00:47:28.340
yourself or your family,
to the material.

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:31.300
Or if there is a serious forest
fire in that region today,

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:34.077
and there's been about a six or
seven year drought in eastern

00:47:34.077 --> 00:47:36.067
Europe,
so this is a serious concern,

00:47:36.067 --> 00:47:38.331
that forest fire would
basically cause these

00:47:38.331 --> 00:47:40.860
radionuclides to go back up into
circulation.

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:44.920
Just as on Bikini Atoll,
where they decided,

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.849
well, let's restore the site.
 

00:47:47.849 --> 00:47:51.802
Let's take off the top meter or
two of soil, and we'll bring in

00:47:51.802 --> 00:47:54.800
fresh soil so that they can grow
crops again.

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:58.838
They still thought that this
would be the effective

00:47:58.838 --> 00:48:01.989
restoration technique in the
Ukraine.

00:48:01.989 --> 00:48:06.900
But they found that it was an
overwhelming area that had been

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:12.210
contaminated,
3,200 square kilometers,

00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:22.550
76,000 square kilometers had
detectable levels of radiation,

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:25.039
and 3,000,000 people lived in
these zones.

00:48:25.039 --> 00:48:26.550
So what do you do with it?
 

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:30.862
What do you do with the
structures that have been

00:48:30.862 --> 00:48:32.210
contaminated?
 

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:33.797
What do you do with the
equipment that's been

00:48:33.797 --> 00:48:34.340
contaminated?
 

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:36.644
In this case,
they decided they were going to

00:48:36.644 --> 00:48:37.170
bury it.
 

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:40.670
So they dug deep trenches and
they buried the military

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:42.731
equipment,
they dug trenches,

00:48:42.731 --> 00:48:47.139
they drove the fire trucks into
them and buried the fire trucks,

00:48:47.139 --> 00:48:48.550
they buried cars.
 

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:51.920
So that they basically figured
well, this is one solution to

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:52.719
the problem.
 

00:48:52.719 --> 00:48:55.648
In a slight aside,
it was kind of interesting that

00:48:55.648 --> 00:48:59.164
when they would bury the cars,
people would be watching as

00:48:59.164 --> 00:49:02.034
they buried the cars,
and then they would go and dig

00:49:02.034 --> 00:49:05.141
up the cars and take the car
parts out at night and then sell

00:49:05.141 --> 00:49:07.059
the car parts on the black
market.

00:49:07.059 --> 00:49:10.954
There's really quite a
similarity here between the

00:49:10.954 --> 00:49:15.646
problem of creating hazardous
waste such as this that's been

00:49:15.646 --> 00:49:20.257
contaminated by nuclear debris
in Chernobyl and the idea of

00:49:20.257 --> 00:49:24.867
creating irradiated hulks of
ships and wondering what to do

00:49:24.867 --> 00:49:26.219
about it.
 

00:49:26.219 --> 00:49:29.159
So that once again,
we'll see a kind of a pattern

00:49:29.159 --> 00:49:32.403
of denial followed by a pattern
of gradually increased

00:49:32.403 --> 00:49:36.728
sophistication and surveillance,
leading to a recognition that,

00:49:36.728 --> 00:49:38.699
oh my gosh,
this problem is much bigger

00:49:38.699 --> 00:49:39.659
than we thought it was.
 

00:49:39.659 --> 00:49:44.268
So, a few concluding thoughts
about this section.

00:49:44.268 --> 00:49:48.641
One is that secrecy is a very
important form of social control

00:49:48.641 --> 00:49:49.789
or regulation.
 

00:49:49.789 --> 00:49:53.114
So if we give the government
the right to maintain secrets,

00:49:53.114 --> 00:49:56.094
we're giving them the right to
control our knowledge,

00:49:56.094 --> 00:49:57.929
to control our intelligence.
 

00:49:57.929 --> 00:50:01.527
And this case demonstrates that
secrecy concentrated knowledge

00:50:01.527 --> 00:50:03.829
among those with authority and
power.

00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:07.713
It basically inhibits broad
public literacy and

00:50:07.713 --> 00:50:08.980
intelligence.
 

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:12.023
It undermines democracy,
because if you don't understand

00:50:12.023 --> 00:50:14.467
these issues,
you certainly are not going to

00:50:14.467 --> 00:50:17.478
be an effective participant in
decision making about how to

00:50:17.478 --> 00:50:18.309
manage risks.
 

00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:20.590
And these are often pretty
technical decisions.

00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:22.760
It prevents accountability.
 

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:26.405
So the bureaucrats inside the
Atomic Energy Commission or the

00:50:26.405 --> 00:50:29.809
Defense Department liked this
part about it very much.

00:50:29.809 --> 00:50:32.876
It basically means that they're
not accountable to anybody

00:50:32.876 --> 00:50:35.730
except to those that also have
security clearances.

00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:40.445
It may restrict individual
liberty, as it has,

00:50:40.445 --> 00:50:44.429
restricting rights of 911
detainees.

00:50:44.429 --> 00:50:48.280
It can enhance the persuasive
power of elites.

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.775
It provides them with narrative
advantage to give their

00:50:50.775 --> 00:50:53.911
interpretation of the story,
so if you don't have the

00:50:53.911 --> 00:50:57.530
evidence to test or to contest
their conclusions,

00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:00.840
you have no political power.
 

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:07.690
And also, it turns secrets into
extremely valuable commodities.

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:11.969
So in a sense,
secrecy creates intellectual

00:51:11.969 --> 00:51:13.090
property.
 

00:51:13.090 --> 00:51:17.945
The more valuable that property
is, the shorter its half life

00:51:17.945 --> 00:51:18.349
is.
 

00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:21.849
I'll leave you with one thought
from Albert Einstein.

00:51:21.849 --> 00:51:24.800
"It's not enough for a
handful of experts to attempt

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.802
the solution of a problem,
to solve it,

00:51:26.802 --> 00:51:28.119
and then to apply it.
 

00:51:28.119 --> 00:51:31.235
The restriction of knowledge to
an elite group destroys the

00:51:31.235 --> 00:51:33.706
spirit of society and leads to
its intellectual

00:51:33.706 --> 00:51:35.050
impoverishment."
 

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:37.780
Okay, thank you.
 

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:39.099
Have a good weekend.
 

00:51:39.099 --> 00:51:44.000

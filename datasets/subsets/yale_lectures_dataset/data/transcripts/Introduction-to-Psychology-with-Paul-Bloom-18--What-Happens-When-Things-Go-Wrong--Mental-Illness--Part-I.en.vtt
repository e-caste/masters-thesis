00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.456
Professor Paul Bloom: I
am extremely pleased to

00:00:15.456 --> 00:00:18.900
introduce the fourth and final
guest lecture of the semester.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.044
Professor Susan Nolen-Hoeksema.
Susan is a professor in the

00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:28.930
Department of Psychology and the
Director of Graduate Studies.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.019
She is well known for her work
in clinical psychology and

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:35.940
especially her research in
depression,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.532
the nature and causes of people
with depression,

00:00:39.532 --> 00:00:43.660
with special focus on sex
differences in depression.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.230
She basically does everything
someone can do.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.158
She is a noted scientist,
winning many awards and

00:00:51.158 --> 00:00:54.820
publishing massive amounts of
work in scientific journals.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.893
She is an award-winning teacher
and has authored what,

00:00:58.893 --> 00:01:02.890
in my mind, is the very best
textbook in her area.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.769
And she's a noted popular
writer who has written popular

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:10.578
and accessible books bringing
the message and ideas and

00:01:10.578 --> 00:01:14.670
theories of clinical psychology
to the broader public.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.383
The only other thing I'll
mention before we welcome her is

00:01:17.383 --> 00:01:20.096
that she's going to teach next
year her course in clinical

00:01:20.096 --> 00:01:22.554
psychology,
which has a superb reputation

00:01:22.554 --> 00:01:24.720
as an extremely interesting
course.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.481
If you are interested in what
you hear today and you want to

00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:29.728
learn more about it,
that's the course you should

00:01:29.728 --> 00:01:34.075
take.
So, let's please welcome Dr.

00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:37.307
Susan Nolen-Hoeksema.
[applause]

00:01:37.307 --> 00:01:38.001
Professor Susan
Nolen-Hoeksema: Thank you

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:40.180
Paul.
Can everybody hear me okay?

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.116
Okay.
So, what I want to do today is

00:01:43.116 --> 00:01:46.812
to give you a very brief
overview of how modern clinical

00:01:46.812 --> 00:01:49.500
psychology looks at mental
disorders,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.704
some of the ways we think about
what constitutes a mental

00:01:52.704 --> 00:01:55.737
disorder, some of the
characteristics that kind of cut

00:01:55.737 --> 00:01:59.097
across mental disorders,
and then I'm going to use the

00:01:59.097 --> 00:02:02.310
case of mood disorders,
that is depression and what is

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.708
now called bipolar disorder,
what you may know more

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:09.780
popularly as manic-depression,
as sort of examples of how we

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.990
think about a particular set of
disorders and some of the ways

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.925
we go about researching the
theories -- different theories

00:02:17.925 --> 00:02:21.859
for the disorders and some of
the prominent treatments for

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.729
disorders these days.
Okay?

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:28.028
So, I'm going to do both a fair
amount of lecturing,

00:02:28.028 --> 00:02:31.909
and then I've got lots of video
clips to show you as well.

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:36.105
So, I'm going to be roaming
around and changing venues here

00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:38.857
fairly often.
So, the first and most

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:42.344
fundamental question in clinical
psychology is,

00:02:42.344 --> 00:02:46.126
"What is abnormality?"
Where do we draw the line

00:02:46.126 --> 00:02:49.446
between normal,
healthy, typical behavior and

00:02:49.446 --> 00:02:52.389
what we might want to call
abnormal,

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:57.754
atypical, deviant,
unhealthy, maladaptive mental

00:02:57.754 --> 00:03:01.055
problems?
We tend to have an intuitive

00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:04.928
sense of what we mean by
abnormality, and we'd like to

00:03:04.928 --> 00:03:09.020
believe--a lot of people who
come into my course say,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.889
"Well, of course,
you know, you guys have figured

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.630
it out.
You know where to draw the line.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.259
You have criteria.
You have blood tests, right?

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:18.142
--that tell me whether I have
depression or schizophrenia or

00:03:18.142 --> 00:03:19.949
one of the things I've read
about."

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.770
Well, the reality is that we
don't.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.737
First of all,
there is no biological test for

00:03:25.737 --> 00:03:28.840
any of the known mental
disorders right now.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.195
And instead what we have is a
set of behavioral criteria for

00:03:34.195 --> 00:03:38.280
how to diagnose different mental
disorders.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.376
And what I mean by behavioral
criteria is a set of symptoms

00:03:42.376 --> 00:03:46.120
that the person reports to you
about how they feel,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.567
how they think,
and a set of observations about

00:03:49.567 --> 00:03:53.389
their behavior and how typical
or atypical it is.

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.076
And you take the sort of set of
symptoms the person shows or

00:03:57.076 --> 00:04:00.763
reports, and you match them up
against the existing criteria

00:04:00.763 --> 00:04:05.251
for different mental disorders.
And then it comes down to a

00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:10.449
fairly subjective judgment call
about whether the person meets

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.166
the criteria or not.
Unfortunately,

00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:15.975
these judgment calls,
because they are so subjective,

00:04:15.975 --> 00:04:18.189
can be influenced by a lot of
factors.

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:21.748
And we won't have a chance to
go into these too much today,

00:04:21.748 --> 00:04:24.080
but just to highlight a few of
them.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.347
The first is social norms.
Whether you get labeled as

00:04:28.347 --> 00:04:32.725
having a mental disorder or a
problem depends very heavily on

00:04:32.725 --> 00:04:35.790
what your social or cultural
norms are.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.217
So, a woman wearing a veil in a
Muslim community or culture

00:04:41.217 --> 00:04:45.053
would be seen as typical,
even prescribed,

00:04:45.053 --> 00:04:48.458
behavior.
Whereas a woman wearing a veil

00:04:48.458 --> 00:04:51.885
in a non-Muslim culture,
especially until fairly

00:04:51.885 --> 00:04:56.188
recently, was often looked upon
as very atypical or abnormal

00:04:56.188 --> 00:04:59.429
behavior.
The second kind of thing that

00:04:59.429 --> 00:05:03.868
gets--that influences whether
something is called normal or

00:05:03.868 --> 00:05:07.541
abnormal is certain
characteristics of the target

00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:09.449
person.
In particular,

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.639
I've highlighted here,
gender.

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.405
Whether you're a man or you're
a woman really influences how

00:05:16.405 --> 00:05:22.370
unusual a certain behavior is.
So, crying is a good example.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.401
A man crying in our culture is
seen as fairly unusual,

00:05:26.401 --> 00:05:30.509
whereas a woman crying is seen
as much less unusual.

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:33.996
On the other hand,
a woman beating up someone is

00:05:33.996 --> 00:05:38.446
taken as quite unusual behavior
where it's less unusual for a

00:05:38.446 --> 00:05:41.475
man.
So, we have gender stereotypes,

00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:45.089
gender roles for what is
acceptable behavior,

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:48.595
and our judgments as to whether
something is normal or abnormal

00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:50.800
get influenced by those gender
roles.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.721
And the third thing that can
influence whether something is

00:05:55.721 --> 00:05:59.199
labeled abnormal or not is the
context.

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:02.560
And here I'm giving you the
example of "paranoia."

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.159
If you're paranoid and
hyper-vigilant,

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:08.040
looking for threat in downtown
Baghdad,

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.226
that's considered very adaptive
behavior these days because it

00:06:12.226 --> 00:06:15.519
could prevent you from getting
hurt or killed.

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:19.072
Whereas, if you're in a quiet
little farm in Central

00:06:19.072 --> 00:06:23.112
Connecticut, being extremely
paranoid and believing there's

00:06:23.112 --> 00:06:27.012
someone who's going to shoot you
around the corner is not

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:31.540
considered as normal or as
acceptable or adaptive behavior.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.542
So, the context in which you
exhibit a particular behavior

00:06:35.542 --> 00:06:39.193
also can heavily influence
whether it gets labeled by

00:06:39.193 --> 00:06:44.064
others as normal or abnormal.
In the field of clinical

00:06:44.064 --> 00:06:48.853
psychology we have a number of
different ways,

00:06:48.853 --> 00:06:55.239
kind of heuristics that we use
to label things as abnormal or

00:06:55.239 --> 00:06:59.713
unhealthy or troubling.
And three of these

00:06:59.713 --> 00:07:03.944
characteristics are what we
often call the three Ds:

00:07:03.944 --> 00:07:07.180
distress, dysfunction,
and deviance.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.995
So, behaviors that cause the
individual or others significant

00:07:11.995 --> 00:07:16.329
distress often get labeled as
abnormal or unhealthy.

00:07:16.329 --> 00:07:19.236
Depression is a prime example,
as we'll see when we talk about

00:07:19.236 --> 00:07:22.959
the characteristics of it.
It's a miserable state of being;

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:26.094
you're unhappy,
you're sad, you may even feel

00:07:26.094 --> 00:07:28.730
so badly you want to kill
yourself.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.027
And that very,
very high level of distress is

00:07:32.027 --> 00:07:36.449
part of the reason why it's
labeled as a mental disorder.

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:39.930
Other mental disorders don't
cause the individual distress,

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.509
but they may cause other people
distress.

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:46.006
So, one example of this is
something called "antisocial

00:07:46.006 --> 00:07:50.378
personality disorder,"
where the individual has no

00:07:50.378 --> 00:07:56.432
regard for the rights of other
people, has no hesitation to

00:07:56.432 --> 00:08:01.129
steal or--steal from or hurt
other people,

00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:05.210
has no empathy or sympathy for
other people's feelings and so

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.223
can inflict a lot of harm on
other people and has absolutely

00:08:09.223 --> 00:08:11.740
no distress over this
whatsoever.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.188
But this behavior causes other
people distress,

00:08:15.188 --> 00:08:19.611
and that's one of the reasons
why that's labeled an abnormal

00:08:19.611 --> 00:08:22.610
behavior or a mental health
problem.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.250
The second general criterion is
"dysfunction."

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.996
If a set of behaviors prevents
the person from functioning in

00:08:30.996 --> 00:08:35.742
daily life, then it might be
labeled as abnormal or might end

00:08:35.742 --> 00:08:39.539
up being labeled as a mental
health problem.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:41.639
Again, depression is a good
example.

00:08:41.639 --> 00:08:44.966
People who are depressed often
become completely

00:08:44.966 --> 00:08:47.607
non-functional.
They can't get up and go to

00:08:47.607 --> 00:08:49.549
class;
they can't go to work;

00:08:49.549 --> 00:08:51.700
they can't interact with their
friends;

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.020
they withdraw and become
totally isolated socially.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.129
So, they might lose their job;
they might flunk out of school.

00:08:58.129 --> 00:09:02.728
And this complete decline in
functioning is one of the major

00:09:02.728 --> 00:09:06.625
reasons that we consider
depression one of the most

00:09:06.625 --> 00:09:10.090
debilitating disorders.
And then finally,

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:14.730
"deviance," the behaviors or
feelings are highly unusual.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.015
This is probably the most
controversial of the three

00:09:18.015 --> 00:09:21.107
because it weighs,
it is so heavily influenced by

00:09:21.107 --> 00:09:24.539
the social norms.
What's deviant in one culture

00:09:24.539 --> 00:09:27.049
is not deviant in another
culture.

00:09:27.049 --> 00:09:31.398
But if a set of behaviors is
completely unacceptable to a

00:09:31.398 --> 00:09:35.514
culture, highly unusual,
they're more likely to end up

00:09:35.514 --> 00:09:40.490
getting labeled as abnormal.
Okay.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.940
So, how do we pull this all
together?

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:47.089
Well, these days the manual for
making diagnoses in clinical

00:09:47.089 --> 00:09:51.239
psychology and psychiatry in the
United States is called the

00:09:51.239 --> 00:09:55.670
Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual or the DSM,

00:09:55.670 --> 00:10:01.488
and it's in its fourth revision.
It's been around since the,

00:10:01.488 --> 00:10:05.484
I believe the '50s,
and the early editions in the

00:10:05.484 --> 00:10:10.230
'50s and '60s were highly
subjective and based on Freudian

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.113
theory.
But since 1980 there's been

00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:16.879
real effort to make the criteria
much more objective,

00:10:16.879 --> 00:10:22.202
to make the set of behaviors or
observations that are required

00:10:22.202 --> 00:10:26.740
to diagnose someone be things
that are observable,

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.127
that you can see in other
people that they can report on

00:10:31.127 --> 00:10:36.232
reliably, and that one clinician
and another clinician will agree

00:10:36.232 --> 00:10:38.994
upon.
So, the DSM gives lists

00:10:38.994 --> 00:10:42.809
of symptoms with the required
symptoms for a diagnosis,

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:45.808
the number of symptoms that
have to be present,

00:10:45.808 --> 00:10:49.509
and the notions of deviation,
dysfunction and distress are

00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:52.882
built into these criteria.
And I'm going to give you a

00:10:52.882 --> 00:10:56.647
couple of examples of these
criteria when we talk about the

00:10:56.647 --> 00:10:59.717
specific types of mood disorder.
So as I said,

00:10:59.717 --> 00:11:03.459
I'm going to use mood disorders
as kind of a case example here

00:11:03.459 --> 00:11:06.281
of how we go about diagnosing
and understanding

00:11:06.281 --> 00:11:09.703
psychopathology,
but I also just want to impart

00:11:09.703 --> 00:11:13.829
some information because mood
disorders are one of the most

00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:16.389
common problems that people
face.

00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:20.264
As many as one in four women
will have an episode of serious

00:11:20.264 --> 00:11:22.759
depression at some time in her
life,

00:11:22.759 --> 00:11:26.228
and about 13% of men will have
an episode of serious depression

00:11:26.228 --> 00:11:29.509
in their lives.
So, these are extremely common

00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:34.246
kinds of problems that people
experience, particularly at your

00:11:34.246 --> 00:11:37.097
age.
The college years are one of

00:11:37.097 --> 00:11:40.064
the peak times of onset,
first onset,

00:11:40.064 --> 00:11:45.208
of depression in particular.
And also, for bipolar disorder,

00:11:45.208 --> 00:11:48.548
or manic-depression,
the late adolescent,

00:11:48.548 --> 00:11:53.224
early 20s are the peak onset
times for these disorders as

00:11:53.224 --> 00:11:55.987
well.
So, the mood disorders divide

00:11:55.987 --> 00:11:59.309
into what's called unipolar
depression disorders,

00:11:59.309 --> 00:12:03.149
which is depression only and
then bipolar disorders where the

00:12:03.149 --> 00:12:06.029
person cycles between depression
and mania.

00:12:06.029 --> 00:12:09.919
And here are the DSM
criteria for major depression,

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:12.990
one of the most severe forms of
depression.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.830
And as I said,
the DSM sets up these

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:19.820
relatively observable criteria
and how many you have to have

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.607
and what absolutely has to be
present in order to get the

00:12:23.607 --> 00:12:26.808
diagnosis.
So, the first criterion in the

00:12:26.808 --> 00:12:31.046
DSM for major depression
is that the individual has to

00:12:31.046 --> 00:12:34.930
either show sadness or a
diminished interest or pleasure

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:39.237
in their usual activities,
which is referred to as

00:12:39.237 --> 00:12:41.938
anhedonia.
So, you have to have one or the

00:12:41.938 --> 00:12:44.769
other of these to sort of pass
the first criterion.

00:12:44.769 --> 00:12:49.505
So, you might say that you feel
sad and blue and just--or

00:12:49.505 --> 00:12:54.496
actually say you feel depressed.
Some people feel those feelings

00:12:54.496 --> 00:12:57.392
very strongly.
Other people don't really feel

00:12:57.392 --> 00:13:00.077
so sad or blue,
but what they'll say is that

00:13:00.077 --> 00:13:03.946
nothing interests them anymore.
It's like the emotion has been

00:13:03.946 --> 00:13:06.100
sucked out of their life
altogether.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.657
They don't have any fun doing
the activities they used to do

00:13:09.657 --> 00:13:11.267
before.
They don't want to hang with

00:13:11.267 --> 00:13:13.595
their friends.
They just--they don't care

00:13:13.595 --> 00:13:17.360
about eating.
Just nothing feels right,

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.649
feels good, anymore.
And then the individual has to

00:13:21.649 --> 00:13:25.426
have four of the--at least four
of the following symptoms in

00:13:25.426 --> 00:13:27.730
addition to sadness or
anhedonia.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:31.738
First, they can show
significant weight or appetite

00:13:31.738 --> 00:13:34.046
change.
So, you may completely lose

00:13:34.046 --> 00:13:36.867
your interest in eating and lose
a lot of weight,

00:13:36.867 --> 00:13:39.100
or some people go on eating
binges.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.734
I had a very good friend who
was depressed for about a year,

00:13:41.734 --> 00:13:44.279
and she gained fifty pounds
because she would just eat.

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:48.220
She would binge eat,
especially at night.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.961
There are sleep
disturbances--insomnia,

00:13:50.961 --> 00:13:54.424
which is having trouble
sleeping, or hypersomnia,

00:13:54.424 --> 00:13:58.830
which is sleeping all the time.
There's a particular form of

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.590
insomnia that's especially
likely in depression where you

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.991
can go to sleep at night,
but then you wake up at about

00:14:05.991 --> 00:14:08.930
three or four in the morning
every night and you can't go

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:12.172
back to sleep at all.
You're just up for the rest of

00:14:12.172 --> 00:14:14.399
the night.
But other people want to sleep

00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:16.450
all day long,
and in the clip I'm going to

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:19.200
show you in just a minute the
woman talks about sleeping

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.400
twenty,
twenty-two hours a day,

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.435
getting up, eating a little
bit, and then going back to bed

00:14:25.435 --> 00:14:29.575
because she was exhausted still.
The third criterion is

00:14:29.575 --> 00:14:32.519
psychomotor retardation or
agitation.

00:14:32.519 --> 00:14:35.945
The retardation is much more
common, and what this means is

00:14:35.945 --> 00:14:39.488
that sort of everything about
the person's movement is slowed

00:14:39.488 --> 00:14:43.019
down.
They'll walk more slowly.

00:14:43.019 --> 00:14:46.110
Their reaction times will be
slowed down.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:49.480
And because they're so much
more slow moving,

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.539
depressed people are often more
prone to accidents.

00:14:53.539 --> 00:14:56.221
They just can't react as
quickly as they need to when

00:14:56.221 --> 00:14:59.366
they're driving or when they're
crossing the road and a car is

00:14:59.366 --> 00:15:02.576
coming at them suddenly.
So, they get into more

00:15:02.576 --> 00:15:06.118
accidents.
And their speech may be slowed

00:15:06.118 --> 00:15:08.511
down.
They may talk very,

00:15:08.511 --> 00:15:13.998
very slowly and it's as though
it just takes a tremendous

00:15:13.998 --> 00:15:19.289
amount of energy to get even a
common sentence out.

00:15:19.289 --> 00:15:22.181
A much more,
much smaller number of people

00:15:22.181 --> 00:15:24.720
get agitated instead of slow
down.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.510
They may be hyper and just feel
like they can't sit still and

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:34.700
such, but the agitation is much
more rare than the retardation.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.284
People feel really tired,
fatigued and like they have

00:15:38.284 --> 00:15:41.523
absolutely no energy.
They can't get up and can't get

00:15:41.523 --> 00:15:44.217
moving.
As I said, they may want to

00:15:44.217 --> 00:15:48.255
just sleep all of the time.
Number five is feelings of

00:15:48.255 --> 00:15:50.460
worthlessness or excessive
guilt.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.746
They may feel as though
everything is their fault,

00:15:53.746 --> 00:15:57.770
and the guilt feelings or sense
of worthlessness can even get

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.062
psychotic.
They can lose touch with

00:16:00.062 --> 00:16:02.230
reality.
When a person loses touch with

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.217
reality when they're depressed,
it typically has really

00:16:05.217 --> 00:16:08.918
depressing themes.
They may believe that they are

00:16:08.918 --> 00:16:13.742
Satan and that they have to
commit suicide because they're

00:16:13.742 --> 00:16:18.603
inflicting evil on the world.
They may believe as though

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:23.325
random events are their fault,
you know, that a flood that

00:16:23.325 --> 00:16:26.389
just happened somehow they
caused.

00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:29.705
So, the feelings of
worthlessness and guilt can get

00:16:29.705 --> 00:16:33.019
completely out of touch with
reality, psychotic.

00:16:33.019 --> 00:16:35.240
More commonly,
they're just unrealistic.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:41.162
They're negative self-esteem,
just being down on yourself,

00:16:41.162 --> 00:16:46.149
feeling stupid and worthless
and ugly and bad.

00:16:46.149 --> 00:16:49.602
Number six is diminished
ability to concentrate or

00:16:49.602 --> 00:16:53.064
indecisiveness.
When you are depressed it's

00:16:53.064 --> 00:16:57.478
really hard to pay attention.
You'll read a passage over and

00:16:57.478 --> 00:17:00.580
over again and you just can't
process it at all.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.563
You can't concentrate on a
lecture so going to class is

00:17:04.563 --> 00:17:07.444
just useless.
You have to make a decision

00:17:07.444 --> 00:17:11.323
about what a paper topic is,
and it just seems like the most

00:17:11.323 --> 00:17:14.915
monumental thing on earth.
You just can't decide anything,

00:17:14.915 --> 00:17:18.918
you can't think anything;
your thoughts are completely

00:17:18.918 --> 00:17:23.066
clouded and overwhelmed.
And then suicidal ideation or

00:17:23.066 --> 00:17:24.860
behavior;
it means you think about

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.940
committing suicide,
you think about dying.

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:30.930
And a subset of people actually
take action to try to hurt

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:34.843
themselves or kill themselves.
Now, it should be said that

00:17:34.843 --> 00:17:38.809
suicidal thoughts and behavior
don't only happen in depression.

00:17:38.809 --> 00:17:42.850
They actually happen in all
types of psychopathology,

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.579
but they're particularly common
in depression.

00:17:46.579 --> 00:17:50.341
So, you have to have at least
one--four of those symptoms plus

00:17:50.341 --> 00:17:53.571
sadness or anhedonia,
and these symptoms--it can't

00:17:53.571 --> 00:17:56.029
just be a bad day that you're
having.

00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:59.578
These symptoms have to be
present persistently for at

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:02.240
least two weeks to get the
diagnosis.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.452
Now, truth be told,
most episodes of major

00:18:04.452 --> 00:18:07.420
depression actually last a lot
longer than two weeks.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:11.866
In fact, the average length of
an episode, if it's not treated,

00:18:11.866 --> 00:18:16.059
is at least six months.
So, people stay this miserable

00:18:16.059 --> 00:18:20.779
for a very long period of time,
but the minimum criterion in

00:18:20.779 --> 00:18:23.980
the DSM is at least two
weeks.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:28.187
So, what I want to do is to
just show you a short clip of a

00:18:28.187 --> 00:18:31.960
woman who has had a lot of
episodes of depression.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.950
Fortunately,
at the moment she's not in an

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.267
episode.
But she can speak very

00:18:37.267 --> 00:18:41.379
articulately about what it's
like to be in the midst of an

00:18:41.379 --> 00:18:45.130
episode and some of the
significant symptoms that she

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.619
had.
Okay.

00:18:46.619 --> 00:18:48.309
There are couple of things she
talks about that I just want to

00:18:48.309 --> 00:18:50.660
comment on.
One is this differentiation

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:55.009
between everyday sad mood and
the kind of depressions we all

00:18:55.009 --> 00:18:58.180
experience and the kind of
debilitating,

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.650
overwhelming depression that
she experiences.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.052
And it is true that there is
this continuum from getting

00:19:05.052 --> 00:19:08.827
bummed out because you didn't do
well on a test or because you

00:19:08.827 --> 00:19:12.292
broke up with a boyfriend or
girlfriend or something like

00:19:12.292 --> 00:19:15.200
this and being completely not
functional,

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.066
vegetative, the way that this
woman becomes whenever she gets

00:19:19.066 --> 00:19:22.208
depressed.
And it would be nice if we were

00:19:22.208 --> 00:19:26.868
really sure where the cutoff was
between those normal everyday

00:19:26.868 --> 00:19:30.230
depressions and what's really a
disorder.

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:33.944
But the reality is we don't
really have real clear

00:19:33.944 --> 00:19:37.579
demarcation lines.
There are a lot of people who

00:19:37.579 --> 00:19:41.817
have more moderate forms of
depression than Tara here talks

00:19:41.817 --> 00:19:45.910
about but who still would
qualify for a diagnosis and are

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.710
still suffering and impaired by
their symptoms.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:53.530
So, I don't want you to get the
sense that if you don't have the

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:57.291
kind of horrible version on the
extreme end of the continuum of

00:19:57.291 --> 00:20:00.819
depression that Tara has,
then there's nothing wrong with

00:20:00.819 --> 00:20:02.759
you, because that's not the
case.

00:20:02.759 --> 00:20:07.642
People who are really slowed,
whom their functioning is

00:20:07.642 --> 00:20:12.977
interfered with--they're just
really unhappy with life--have

00:20:12.977 --> 00:20:17.859
problems that can be helped and
do need attention.

00:20:17.859 --> 00:20:20.977
And it is the case that much
more moderate forms of

00:20:20.977 --> 00:20:24.656
depression can morph into more
serious forms if they're left

00:20:24.656 --> 00:20:26.960
untreated.
So, there is this continuum.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.620
The other things I wanted to
comment on that she talks about

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:34.280
early on in this piece is the
fact that she hauls herself up

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.598
and goes through her day,
even when she's feeling really,

00:20:37.598 --> 00:20:39.542
really depressed.
And there is this

00:20:39.542 --> 00:20:43.167
characteristic of a lot of
depressed people that I call the

00:20:43.167 --> 00:20:46.089
"walking wounded."
They just haul themselves

00:20:46.089 --> 00:20:49.564
through the day trying to act
normal, trying not to let

00:20:49.564 --> 00:20:53.039
anybody know that there's
anything wrong with them,

00:20:53.039 --> 00:20:58.839
trying to keep up with their
schoolwork or their employment.

00:20:58.839 --> 00:21:01.400
But they're miserable and
they're not functioning at the

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.309
level that they're capable of
and such.

00:21:03.309 --> 00:21:06.143
And that's something that's
very, very common,

00:21:06.143 --> 00:21:10.111
and it's in part because people
don't feel as though they should

00:21:10.111 --> 00:21:14.078
have to get treatment or they're
ashamed of getting treatment or

00:21:14.078 --> 00:21:18.327
seeking help for depression.
And so, they just keep going on

00:21:18.327 --> 00:21:20.571
and going on,
sometimes for years,

00:21:20.571 --> 00:21:23.494
in a very sorry state
before--sometimes they

00:21:23.494 --> 00:21:27.438
just--they end up actually
falling apart to the point where

00:21:27.438 --> 00:21:31.319
they have to get help.
Okay.

00:21:31.319 --> 00:21:35.720
The other category of mood
disorders that I mentioned is

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.378
bipolar disorders.
And as I said,

00:21:38.378 --> 00:21:41.930
bipolar disorder involves
symptoms or periods of

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:46.163
depression but then also
distinct periods of the opposite

00:21:46.163 --> 00:21:48.970
of depression,
which we call "mania."

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:53.022
So, the person cycles back and
forth between debilitating

00:21:53.022 --> 00:21:57.056
depressions and manic episodes.
So, let me describe manic

00:21:57.056 --> 00:22:00.519
episodes to you now.
So, the first criterion is that

00:22:00.519 --> 00:22:04.006
instead of feeling down,
blue or depressed the person

00:22:04.006 --> 00:22:07.494
has an abnormally and
persistently elevated expansive

00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:10.109
or irritable mood that isn't
just,

00:22:10.109 --> 00:22:15.185
again, a good day because you
won a prize or got an "A," but

00:22:15.185 --> 00:22:18.539
rather, it's this unusually
positive,

00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:24.599
expansive mood for at least one
week persistently.

00:22:24.599 --> 00:22:27.887
And then the person has to have
three or more of the following

00:22:27.887 --> 00:22:30.461
symptoms.
First, inflated self-esteem or

00:22:30.461 --> 00:22:33.468
grandiosity.
The individual may feel as

00:22:33.468 --> 00:22:37.352
though they are the smartest,
the most creative,

00:22:37.352 --> 00:22:39.985
insightful,
powerful person on earth,

00:22:39.985 --> 00:22:42.759
and they are perfectly happy to
tell you this.

00:22:42.759 --> 00:22:46.033
So, there is no problem with
self-esteem, thank you very

00:22:46.033 --> 00:22:48.455
much.
"If you can't keep up with me

00:22:48.455 --> 00:22:51.740
it's your fault."
There's a decreased need for

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.972
sleep;
they may only sleep a couple of

00:22:53.972 --> 00:22:56.140
hours a night and get up raring
to go.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.745
They tend to be more talkative
than usual, and there's a really

00:22:59.745 --> 00:23:02.497
pressure to their talk.
They'll talk really pressured,

00:23:02.497 --> 00:23:04.140
and they'll talk really,
really fast.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.910
And one of the reasons they're
talking really,

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:07.799
really fast is they have this
flight of ideas.

00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:09.728
The thoughts are just racing
through their mind,

00:23:09.728 --> 00:23:11.779
and they can't talk fast enough
to get them out.

00:23:11.779 --> 00:23:13.493
And if you can't follow them,
that--well, that's because

00:23:13.493 --> 00:23:14.769
you're not smart enough to
follow them.

00:23:14.769 --> 00:23:18.448
But they've just got too many
good ideas and they've got to

00:23:18.448 --> 00:23:21.480
get them out.
They're highly distractible.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:25.640
And then there is this increase
in this--what the DSM

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.319
calls this "goal-directed
activity."

00:23:28.319 --> 00:23:32.099
Out of their grandiosity will
come these grand schemes

00:23:32.099 --> 00:23:36.377
for--often for making a lot of
money and they'll pursue these

00:23:36.377 --> 00:23:40.869
with great vigor no matter how
totally irrational they are.

00:23:40.869 --> 00:23:43.967
So, it's not at all uncommon
for them to cash out all the

00:23:43.967 --> 00:23:46.424
family bank accounts,
to sell the house,

00:23:46.424 --> 00:23:49.385
to sell the car,
to sell the kids so that they

00:23:49.385 --> 00:23:53.333
can finance this great scheme
for making a zillion dollars on

00:23:53.333 --> 00:23:55.610
the Internet tomorrow.
Right?

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:58.369
Okay.
And they'll pursue this with

00:23:58.369 --> 00:24:01.298
tremendous vigor.
They'll also get involved in

00:24:01.298 --> 00:24:04.167
all kinds of,
what the DSM discreetly

00:24:04.167 --> 00:24:07.369
calls "pleasurable but dangerous
activities."

00:24:07.369 --> 00:24:11.685
There's a lot of sexual
promiscuity, a lot of drug

00:24:11.685 --> 00:24:14.240
abuse, a lot of,
as I said,

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.409
getting--going and gambling,
believing that you're on a hot

00:24:17.409 --> 00:24:19.539
streak, there's nothing can stop
you.

00:24:19.539 --> 00:24:22.055
You know, you're just so
brilliant and you've got this

00:24:22.055 --> 00:24:24.990
scheme, you've got the plan.
You're going to make it.

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:28.643
Okay?
So, the individual has three of

00:24:28.643 --> 00:24:32.019
more of these kinds of symptoms
plus this elevated,

00:24:32.019 --> 00:24:34.990
expansive and often quite
irritable mood.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.176
It's not just that they're
happy, you know,

00:24:37.176 --> 00:24:40.332
and sort of upbeat.
It's just that they're just

00:24:40.332 --> 00:24:43.539
impatient and irritable and
trigger-fire.

00:24:43.539 --> 00:24:46.843
And sometimes they can become
violent because they're

00:24:46.843 --> 00:24:50.210
just--they're so incredibly
agitated and irritable.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:53.100
So, let me show you a couple of
clips.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.009
I have one really short one.
It's not a real high quality

00:24:56.009 --> 00:24:58.904
clip, but it's a very,
very nice example of an older

00:24:58.904 --> 00:25:01.630
woman who is in the midst of a
manic episode.

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:07.157
And it shows what this kind of
agitation and flight of ideas

00:25:07.157 --> 00:25:10.529
and racing thoughts can look
like.

00:25:10.529 --> 00:25:16.557
And then the other one is--I'll
introduce whenever you--we do

00:25:16.557 --> 00:25:18.781
it.
So while she was at the

00:25:18.781 --> 00:25:22.673
hairdresser's it's a nice
example of how she was just

00:25:22.673 --> 00:25:25.678
pressured to speak.
Nobody was telling her that she

00:25:25.678 --> 00:25:28.405
had to say all of these things.
They were just standing there

00:25:28.405 --> 00:25:31.102
with a camera and she was going
on and on and on about these

00:25:31.102 --> 00:25:33.018
things.
And as you could see she was

00:25:33.018 --> 00:25:36.144
getting more and more agitated
and more and more irritated as

00:25:36.144 --> 00:25:39.579
she was retelling her story.
And then what?

00:25:39.579 --> 00:25:44.067
In the last little bit there
you saw her flip from her mania

00:25:44.067 --> 00:25:47.872
into a more depressed state.
And this poor lady,

00:25:47.872 --> 00:25:51.478
unfortunately,
is having a hard time finding a

00:25:51.478 --> 00:25:54.157
stable point.
He talked about lithium there,

00:25:54.157 --> 00:25:56.720
and I'll talk about it in a
little bit--about the use of

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.470
lithium as a drug to try to
stabilize these mood swings.

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:03.308
But at this point in this
video, it's not working for this

00:26:03.308 --> 00:26:06.074
lady.
And so, she's flipping back and

00:26:06.074 --> 00:26:10.960
forth, but they're having a hard
time finding that middle ground.

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.872
So, I want to show you another
clip--it's a little bit

00:26:13.872 --> 00:26:16.289
longer--of a man who has bipolar
disorder.

00:26:16.289 --> 00:26:21.313
He is not currently in an
episode of either depression or

00:26:21.313 --> 00:26:25.440
mania, but again,
he can talk about some of the

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:30.284
things he got himself into and
how it manifested in his

00:26:30.284 --> 00:26:33.480
behavior.
Okay.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.246
Just a couple of things that
Bernie talks about that I want

00:26:36.246 --> 00:26:38.836
to comment on.
One is that just as in

00:26:38.836 --> 00:26:42.740
depression, mania has--runs
along a continuum.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:48.880
So, it can be relatively mild
all the way to extremely severe

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:53.186
and even psychotic.
So, when a person with mania

00:26:53.186 --> 00:26:57.421
loses touch with reality,
instead of having beliefs that

00:26:57.421 --> 00:27:01.579
they are Satan or they've done
some horrible thing,

00:27:01.579 --> 00:27:06.069
they'll believe that they are
some supernatural being.

00:27:06.069 --> 00:27:09.954
They may believe that they are
the Messiah or that they are

00:27:09.954 --> 00:27:12.933
Albert Einstein,
you know, come back to life,

00:27:12.933 --> 00:27:16.543
or that they have supernatural
powers or something of this

00:27:16.543 --> 00:27:19.058
sort,
so that their false beliefs,

00:27:19.058 --> 00:27:21.928
their delusions and their
hallucinations,

00:27:21.928 --> 00:27:26.018
the things that they see and
hear that aren't really there

00:27:26.018 --> 00:27:29.390
tend to be very grandiose in
their themes.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:33.056
Bernie's mania is not on the
far end of the continuum by any

00:27:33.056 --> 00:27:36.660
stretch, but you can see it
still gets him into trouble.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:40.608
Now, there are people who
have--who cycle between fairly

00:27:40.608 --> 00:27:44.556
low levels of mania and fairly
low levels of depression,

00:27:44.556 --> 00:27:47.877
back and forth.
And there's been some argument

00:27:47.877 --> 00:27:50.878
that people who are kind of
chronically, mildly

00:27:50.878 --> 00:27:54.467
manic--especially if they're
really smart or they have a

00:27:54.467 --> 00:27:57.730
special talent – can make it
work for them.

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:02.112
And there is a wonderful book
by Kay Jamison,

00:28:02.112 --> 00:28:06.495
who is a professor at Johns
Hopkins where she

00:28:06.495 --> 00:28:11.973
chronicles--She does sort of
historical biographies on a

00:28:11.973 --> 00:28:17.849
number of well-known authors and
poets and musicians,

00:28:17.849 --> 00:28:22.567
Robert Schumann and a number of
politicians, Winston Churchill

00:28:22.567 --> 00:28:26.665
and such, arguing that they
actually had mild forms of

00:28:26.665 --> 00:28:31.459
bipolar disorder and that they
were able to sort of channel the

00:28:31.459 --> 00:28:34.939
manic episodes through
extraordinary talent or

00:28:34.939 --> 00:28:39.269
intelligence in ways that made
it work for them.

00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:42.729
There are also a number of
arguments that very,

00:28:42.729 --> 00:28:47.241
very successful CEOs sometimes
are people who are chronically

00:28:47.241 --> 00:28:50.302
slightly manic.
They can go on a couple of

00:28:50.302 --> 00:28:53.691
hours a night of sleep;
they're obviously really quite

00:28:53.691 --> 00:28:57.454
grandiose and self-confident,
and that they can maintain this

00:28:57.454 --> 00:29:01.224
kind of moderate level of mania,
keep it under control and

00:29:01.224 --> 00:29:03.680
channel it in ways that work for
them.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.563
So, if you're interested in
that book, send me an email and

00:29:07.563 --> 00:29:10.509
I'm happy to send you the
citation for it.

00:29:10.509 --> 00:29:14.463
But for the most part,
mania can get people into

00:29:14.463 --> 00:29:17.638
tremendous trouble.
They can, as I said,

00:29:17.638 --> 00:29:21.231
get involved in sexual
promiscuity that puts them at

00:29:21.231 --> 00:29:24.190
risk for sexually transmitted
diseases.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:25.920
They can get involved in drug
activity.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.119
They can get themselves
arrested.

00:29:28.119 --> 00:29:30.845
They can certainly send
themselves and their family into

00:29:30.845 --> 00:29:33.274
bankruptcy.
And these kinds of negative

00:29:33.274 --> 00:29:37.437
consequences of the mania often
are what motivates the person to

00:29:37.437 --> 00:29:41.270
get help because the mania
itself can be rather pleasurable

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:44.109
to have.
Also, what motivates them to

00:29:44.109 --> 00:29:48.140
get help is the plunge into
depression, the knowledge that

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.135
they will,
at some point,

00:29:50.135 --> 00:29:54.819
come out of the mania and go
into a debilitating depression.

00:29:54.819 --> 00:29:57.880
Bipolar disorder is much less
common than depression.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.792
I said that about 22% of women
and about 13% of men will have

00:30:01.792 --> 00:30:05.900
an episode of serious depression
at some time in their lives.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:10.294
Bipolar disorder occurs in only
about 1% of the population,

00:30:10.294 --> 00:30:13.779
and it's equally prevalent in
women and men.

00:30:13.779 --> 00:30:18.626
So, it's a really quite
different disorder in many ways

00:30:18.626 --> 00:30:22.491
from depression alone.
I want to give you some other

00:30:22.491 --> 00:30:25.973
statistics about depression per
se, and this only applies to

00:30:25.973 --> 00:30:29.271
depression.
There are quite large age

00:30:29.271 --> 00:30:33.720
differences in the prevalence of
depression.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.952
These are data from a
nationwide study of people

00:30:36.952 --> 00:30:41.078
between the ages of fifteen and
fifty-five, and these are the

00:30:41.078 --> 00:30:43.829
percentages of people in this
study.

00:30:43.829 --> 00:30:46.240
And there were several thousand
people in the study.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:50.167
These are not people who have
sought treatment for depression

00:30:50.167 --> 00:30:52.589
but just a random community
sample.

00:30:52.589 --> 00:30:55.299
And this is the percentage
who've had an episode of major

00:30:55.299 --> 00:30:58.356
depression in the past month.
And as you can see,

00:30:58.356 --> 00:31:03.269
the fifteen to twenty-four age
range has the highest rates,

00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:07.132
and then they go down somewhat,
although the thirty-five to

00:31:07.132 --> 00:31:10.130
forty-four is fairly high as
well with age.

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:13.646
You might be surprised to learn
that the rates of major

00:31:13.646 --> 00:31:17.227
depression in the elderly are
actually quite low by most

00:31:17.227 --> 00:31:22.050
national statistics.
And that's true up to about age

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:27.221
eighty or eighty-five.
And the arguments for why this

00:31:27.221 --> 00:31:30.339
is the case are very
interesting.

00:31:30.339 --> 00:31:34.688
There are some people who argue
that as you get older you get

00:31:34.688 --> 00:31:38.965
wiser, and so that's why we see
lower rates of depression in

00:31:38.965 --> 00:31:41.530
older age.
There are other people who

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:44.452
argue that current
generation--younger generations

00:31:44.452 --> 00:31:46.555
now;
your generation and the one

00:31:46.555 --> 00:31:50.176
above you--are more prone to
depression and will be for the

00:31:50.176 --> 00:31:53.359
rest of your life compared to
your grandparents,

00:31:53.359 --> 00:31:58.021
because of historical changes
in the kinds of social support

00:31:58.021 --> 00:32:02.840
and family networks available
and a number of other historical

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:06.569
cultural changes.
The other sort of side of the

00:32:06.569 --> 00:32:10.351
argument is that because
depression is known to impact

00:32:10.351 --> 00:32:14.561
negatively your physical health
– depression is associated

00:32:14.561 --> 00:32:18.130
with higher rates of
cardio-vascular disease,

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:21.523
stroke, immune system diseases,
a whole host of diseases that

00:32:21.523 --> 00:32:24.803
people die from--that people who
have a lifelong history of

00:32:24.803 --> 00:32:28.480
depression are actually more
likely to die at an earlier age,

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.321
and that's why we see
relatively low rates in older

00:32:31.321 --> 00:32:33.321
age people.
We don't know yet which of

00:32:33.321 --> 00:32:36.480
these explanations is true.
It may be that they're all true

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.470
to some extent.
There are also gender

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:44.066
differences in depression.
These are data from a

00:32:44.066 --> 00:32:48.609
compilation of hundreds of
studies of children and

00:32:48.609 --> 00:32:51.766
adolescents,
looking at not full-blown

00:32:51.766 --> 00:32:55.228
depression but levels of
depression on self-report

00:32:55.228 --> 00:32:57.802
questionnaires.
Probably most of you have

00:32:57.802 --> 00:33:00.877
filled out these questionnaires,
like the Beck Depression

00:33:00.877 --> 00:33:04.056
Inventory that ask you how
you've been feeling in the last

00:33:04.056 --> 00:33:06.212
month.
And there's a kiddy version of

00:33:06.212 --> 00:33:09.166
this, and these are data from
that, from several thousand

00:33:09.166 --> 00:33:11.408
children.
And as you can see here,

00:33:11.408 --> 00:33:15.027
prior to the age of about
thirteen, boys and girls have

00:33:15.027 --> 00:33:17.910
relatively similar levels of
depression.

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:20.808
But beginning around the
pubertal years,

00:33:20.808 --> 00:33:25.268
girls' rates of depression go
up quite dramatically and boys'

00:33:25.268 --> 00:33:29.134
rates stay the same or go down.
And by the time they're

00:33:29.134 --> 00:33:32.105
eighteen or twenty you get
almost a two-to-one ratio of

00:33:32.105 --> 00:33:34.140
depressed girls to depressed
boys.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:38.269
And then this is true for the
rest of the adult age span.

00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:42.000
There are lots of hypotheses
about this, why it's true.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.079
There are biological hypotheses
that have to do with hormones.

00:33:46.079 --> 00:33:49.805
There are sociological
hypotheses that have to do with

00:33:49.805 --> 00:33:52.828
the kinds of stress,
and particularly abuse,

00:33:52.828 --> 00:33:55.500
in girls' lives relative to
boys'.

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:59.387
We don't know exactly why.
It's probably a lot of these

00:33:59.387 --> 00:34:04.119
things coming together that make
this huge two-to-one ratio true.

00:34:04.119 --> 00:34:07.710
So, let's talk a little bit
about the major theories and

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:10.059
treatments for the mood
disorders.

00:34:10.059 --> 00:34:12.338
There are biological theories
and treatments,

00:34:12.338 --> 00:34:14.928
what are known as cognitive
behavioral theories and

00:34:14.928 --> 00:34:17.259
treatments and then
interpersonal theories and

00:34:17.259 --> 00:34:19.697
treatments.
And I'll walk you through

00:34:19.697 --> 00:34:24.380
examples of each of these.
So, first, genetics.

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:27.972
It's pretty clear that genetics
are involved in the mood

00:34:27.972 --> 00:34:30.650
disorders, especially bipolar
disorder.

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:33.957
There is very strong evidence
in bipolar disorder,

00:34:33.957 --> 00:34:37.737
and there are a number of
ways--Have you talked about how

00:34:37.737 --> 00:34:39.980
you do genetic studies?
Okay.

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:44.093
So, you guys know about twin
studies for example and family

00:34:44.093 --> 00:34:47.068
history studies.
So, this is actually a

00:34:47.068 --> 00:34:49.769
compilation of a group of
studies.

00:34:49.769 --> 00:34:54.500
And here you've got some of
them – twin studies--compared.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:58.328
So, in monozygotic twins,
if your identical twin has

00:34:58.328 --> 00:35:01.782
bipolar disorder,
you have over a 60% chance of

00:35:01.782 --> 00:35:05.073
having the disorder yourself.
In contrast,

00:35:05.073 --> 00:35:09.209
if it's your--if you're just a
fraternal twin of a person with

00:35:09.209 --> 00:35:12.056
bipolar disorder,
you only have about a 12%

00:35:12.056 --> 00:35:16.096
chance of having the disorder.
So, that massive difference

00:35:16.096 --> 00:35:19.862
there is very strong evidence
that there's a genetic component

00:35:19.862 --> 00:35:22.269
to the transmission of the
disorder.

00:35:22.269 --> 00:35:27.658
Similarly, the more distant you
get in terms of your biological

00:35:27.658 --> 00:35:31.570
relation to a person with
bipolar disorder,

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:35.880
the lower your rate or your
risk of the disorder is.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:40.156
So, the second degree relatives
of a person with bipolar

00:35:40.156 --> 00:35:44.900
disorder only have about 2%
chance of getting the disorder.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:48.614
And that's barely above what's
in the general population,

00:35:48.614 --> 00:35:52.130
which is about a 1% chance of
getting the disorder.

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:55.760
So, it's very clear that
bipolar disorder has a genetic

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.739
component to it.
With depression alone,

00:35:58.739 --> 00:36:02.518
major depression,
there are probably versions of

00:36:02.518 --> 00:36:06.780
the disorder that have a
stronger genetic component to

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.897
them than others.
And in particular,

00:36:09.897 --> 00:36:14.314
folks who have what's called
"early onset depression," where

00:36:14.314 --> 00:36:18.357
their first episodes come on in
childhood or very early

00:36:18.357 --> 00:36:21.381
adolescence,
seem to have a form of

00:36:21.381 --> 00:36:25.840
depression that has a stronger
genetic component to it.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:29.420
Whereas, people who have
depression that is clearly

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:33.788
triggered by a major life event
like a trauma or a loss--those

00:36:33.788 --> 00:36:37.654
types of depression are less
clearly linked strongly to

00:36:37.654 --> 00:36:41.052
genetic factors.
There are also a number of

00:36:41.052 --> 00:36:44.838
neurotransmitters that have been
implicated in the mood

00:36:44.838 --> 00:36:46.743
disorders.
And the class of

00:36:46.743 --> 00:36:50.468
neurotransmitters that's been
researched most often is what's

00:36:50.468 --> 00:36:54.043
called the monoamines.
I'm sure you've heard about the

00:36:54.043 --> 00:36:57.634
link between serotonin and
depression, but there are two

00:36:57.634 --> 00:37:00.893
other monoamines,
norepinephrine and dopamine,

00:37:00.893 --> 00:37:04.940
that have also been linked to
both of the mood disorders,

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:09.179
both bipolar disorder and
depression.

00:37:09.179 --> 00:37:12.639
And it used to be thought that
it was just that in people with

00:37:12.639 --> 00:37:15.022
depression they didn't have
enough of these

00:37:15.022 --> 00:37:17.740
neurotransmitters,
enough serotonin,

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:20.163
in particular,
in the system,

00:37:20.163 --> 00:37:24.230
in the brain,
in order to function normally.

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:29.167
But now the theories on what
the role of neurotransmitters is

00:37:29.167 --> 00:37:33.199
have a lot more to do with the
receptors for these

00:37:33.199 --> 00:37:36.820
neurotransmitters and their
functioning.

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:40.544
And the notion is that the
receptors for neurotransmitters

00:37:40.544 --> 00:37:43.420
like serotonin don't function
efficiently.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:48.210
So, even if there's enough of
the chemicals in the synapses in

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:52.608
the brain, the neurons can't
make use of them because the

00:37:52.608 --> 00:37:56.300
receptors aren't functioning
appropriately.

00:37:56.300 --> 00:38:01.222
And so what the drugs that help
relieve depression do is to

00:38:01.222 --> 00:38:05.719
improve the functioning of these
neurotransmitters.

00:38:05.719 --> 00:38:09.706
There's a very interesting line
of work that's going on right

00:38:09.706 --> 00:38:13.426
now looking at the intersection
of genetic predisposition

00:38:13.426 --> 00:38:16.349
neurotransmitter functioning and
stress.

00:38:16.349 --> 00:38:20.836
And we have one of the world's
experts on this kind of work now

00:38:20.836 --> 00:38:22.935
here at Yale,
Julia Kim-Cohen,

00:38:22.935 --> 00:38:25.829
who just joined us in the last
year.

00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:27.539
But there are several recent
studies.

00:38:27.539 --> 00:38:30.002
There's another person in
psychiatry, Joan Kaufman,

00:38:30.002 --> 00:38:33.474
who's done some of this work.
But there are several recent

00:38:33.474 --> 00:38:37.640
studies that find that certain
variations or polymorphisms on

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:41.320
the serotonin transporter gene
predict who will become

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:46.326
depressed in the face of stress.
So, a classic study was done by

00:38:46.326 --> 00:38:51.043
Avshalom Caspi and colleagues,
and they found that people who

00:38:51.043 --> 00:38:55.367
have one or two of what's called
the short allele on the

00:38:55.367 --> 00:39:00.083
serotonin transporter gene--so
this is a particular variation

00:39:00.083 --> 00:39:04.721
on the serotonin transporter
gene--if they had one or two of

00:39:04.721 --> 00:39:09.909
these short alleles and they
were confronted with stress,

00:39:09.909 --> 00:39:17.219
they were more likely to
develop depression.

00:39:17.219 --> 00:39:21.510
But it's important to sort of
dissect this.

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:25.414
So people who had--it didn't
really matter which of these

00:39:25.414 --> 00:39:28.811
genes you had.
If you were never confronted

00:39:28.811 --> 00:39:32.478
with major kinds of stress,
like maltreatment,

00:39:32.478 --> 00:39:35.820
if you weren't confronted with
stress,

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:40.968
you were no more likely to have
depression regardless of what

00:39:40.968 --> 00:39:46.192
kind of serotonin gene you had.
But if you had either one short

00:39:46.192 --> 00:39:50.436
allele or two short alleles and
you were confronted with

00:39:50.436 --> 00:39:53.813
maltreatment as a child,
you had a much greater

00:39:53.813 --> 00:39:56.929
probability of becoming
depressed at some time in your

00:39:56.929 --> 00:39:59.312
life.
And this has been replicated

00:39:59.312 --> 00:40:02.317
with other samples,
with other forms of major

00:40:02.317 --> 00:40:05.243
trauma.
And basically the story is,

00:40:05.243 --> 00:40:10.394
it takes the intersection of a
genetic predisposition and major

00:40:10.394 --> 00:40:15.130
stress to create full-blown
depression in some people.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:18.392
Now, that may not be true for
all genetic predispositions or

00:40:18.392 --> 00:40:21.876
all forms of depression,
but this serotonin finding has

00:40:21.876 --> 00:40:26.309
actually been replicated now in
at least four different studies.

00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:30.360
So, it seems to be a pretty
reliable effect.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:34.544
So again, genes do not
determine the disorder,

00:40:34.544 --> 00:40:40.031
but the intersection of genes
and stress seems to be a major

00:40:40.031 --> 00:40:44.996
risk factor for the disorder.
There are a number of brain

00:40:44.996 --> 00:40:48.999
areas that seem to be involved
in the mood disorders where

00:40:48.999 --> 00:40:52.230
there is just dysregulation or
dysfunction.

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:55.988
The prefrontal cortex,
as you probably have studied,

00:40:55.988 --> 00:41:00.337
is an area of the brain that's
very involved in higher order

00:41:00.337 --> 00:41:04.464
complex thinking and problem
solving and in goal-directed

00:41:04.464 --> 00:41:07.386
behavior.
In people with depression,

00:41:07.386 --> 00:41:10.949
there's lowered activity in the
prefrontal cortex,

00:41:10.949 --> 00:41:16.452
suggesting that--which may play
a role in the difficulties in

00:41:16.452 --> 00:41:20.532
concentration,
in goal-directed behavior,

00:41:20.532 --> 00:41:26.460
in planning and problem solving
and in regulating emotion.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:29.616
The amygdala is an area of the
brain that is involved in the

00:41:29.616 --> 00:41:31.650
processing of emotional
information.

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:37.453
And people with mood disorders
show overactive amygdala

00:41:37.453 --> 00:41:41.429
responses to emotional
information.

00:41:41.429 --> 00:41:47.389
This is true in both bipolar
and in depression.

00:41:47.389 --> 00:41:51.693
The hippocampus is an area of
the brain that's very involved

00:41:51.693 --> 00:41:55.796
in memory and in concentration.
And in people with chronic

00:41:55.796 --> 00:41:59.449
depression, you often see
shrinkage in the hippocampus,

00:41:59.449 --> 00:42:03.783
and this may be related to
their problems in concentration

00:42:03.783 --> 00:42:05.767
and attention.
And then finally,

00:42:05.767 --> 00:42:08.117
the anterior cingulate is an
area of the brain that's

00:42:08.117 --> 00:42:10.150
involved in a lot of different
activities,

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:14.221
but pertinent to the mood
disorders, particularly in

00:42:14.221 --> 00:42:19.012
responses to distress--to stress
and in sort of the choice of

00:42:19.012 --> 00:42:21.338
behaviors.
And it may be that

00:42:21.338 --> 00:42:25.434
dysregulation of the anterior
cingulate may be involved in the

00:42:25.434 --> 00:42:28.724
person's difficulty in
responding appropriately to

00:42:28.724 --> 00:42:30.958
stress,
in choosing good coping

00:42:30.958 --> 00:42:34.189
behaviors and changing their
behaviors whenever their

00:42:34.189 --> 00:42:36.240
behaviors aren't working well.

00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:43.117
So, from the biological
theories come a number of

00:42:43.117 --> 00:42:45.769
different drugs to treat the
mood disorders.

00:42:45.769 --> 00:42:49.151
Two of the older classes are
called the monoamine oxidase

00:42:49.151 --> 00:42:51.989
inhibitors and the tricyclic
antidepressants.

00:42:51.989 --> 00:42:55.750
The tricyclics are still used
these days to some extent.

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:59.133
They're relatively effective.
About 60% of people respond

00:42:59.133 --> 00:43:02.490
well to the tricyclics,
but they have a lot of side

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:05.579
effects, and they can be fatal
in overdose.

00:43:05.579 --> 00:43:09.875
And so there was a--has been
always a search for other

00:43:09.875 --> 00:43:13.217
alternatives to them.
The drugs that have really

00:43:13.217 --> 00:43:16.513
taken over the market are the
selective serotonin re-uptake

00:43:16.513 --> 00:43:19.019
inhibitors or SSRIs.
This is Paxil,

00:43:19.019 --> 00:43:22.529
Prozac and the like.
They were introduced in

00:43:22.529 --> 00:43:26.546
1987--Prozac was--in the U.S.
market and truly took over the

00:43:26.546 --> 00:43:29.762
market in the treatment of
depression and anxiety and a

00:43:29.762 --> 00:43:33.229
number of other disorders.
Now, they're not that much more

00:43:33.229 --> 00:43:36.260
effective than the sort of old
style antidepressants,

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:38.803
but they have fewer side
effects and they tend to be

00:43:38.803 --> 00:43:41.507
easier for people to tolerate.
More recently,

00:43:41.507 --> 00:43:44.910
there are selective
serotonin/norepinephrine

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:47.734
re-uptake inhibitors.
These drugs,

00:43:47.734 --> 00:43:52.278
by the way, what these drugs
supposedly do is to prevent the

00:43:52.278 --> 00:43:56.361
re-uptake of serotonin or
serotonin and norepinephrine

00:43:56.361 --> 00:44:01.099
back into the sending neuron.
So, it creates more of the

00:44:01.099 --> 00:44:04.280
neurotransmitter there in the
synapse.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.304
And these are reasonably
effective drugs,

00:44:06.304 --> 00:44:08.682
although, again,
there's a substantial number of

00:44:08.682 --> 00:44:11.769
people who don't respond to
them, especially immediately.

00:44:11.769 --> 00:44:15.550
And they'll often have to cycle
through a number of drugs before

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:19.161
they find one that works.
Lithium is the drug of choice

00:44:19.161 --> 00:44:21.840
for the treatment of bipolar
disorder.

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:26.155
It seems to stabilize the mood
swings by stabilizing the number

00:44:26.155 --> 00:44:28.940
of different neurotransmitter
systems.

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:34.644
But the lithium is problematic
because there are tremendous

00:44:34.644 --> 00:44:37.646
side effects.
It's also dangerous for women

00:44:37.646 --> 00:44:40.909
to take while they're pregnant
in terms of fetal development.

00:44:40.909 --> 00:44:44.449
So, it's a very tough drug to
stay on.

00:44:44.449 --> 00:44:47.581
There are lots of
gastrointestinal side effects

00:44:47.581 --> 00:44:50.849
and such, and people are often
on lithium and the

00:44:50.849 --> 00:44:54.865
antidepressants because lithium
often only affects the manic

00:44:54.865 --> 00:44:58.949
episodes but it doesn't really
relieve the depression.

00:44:58.949 --> 00:45:02.882
And then finally anti-psychotic
medications, that is those help

00:45:02.882 --> 00:45:05.420
people who've lost touch with
reality,

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:10.591
are sometimes used to treat the
mood disorders whenever the

00:45:10.591 --> 00:45:13.889
person has lost touch with
reality.

00:45:13.889 --> 00:45:18.143
I'm going to go through and
talk about some of the

00:45:18.143 --> 00:45:23.699
psychosocial treatments because
I want to get to them as well.

00:45:23.699 --> 00:45:28.570
The cognitive behavioral
therapies are based on Aaron

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:33.159
Beck's Negative Cognitive Theory
of Depression.

00:45:33.159 --> 00:45:36.647
Aaron Beck is a psychiatrist at
the University of Pennsylvania

00:45:36.647 --> 00:45:39.219
who really founded this whole
line of work.

00:45:39.219 --> 00:45:42.121
And according to Beck,
this--now, this applies to

00:45:42.121 --> 00:45:44.587
depression alone.
It doesn't really apply to

00:45:44.587 --> 00:45:46.903
bipolar disorder.
People who are depressed have a

00:45:46.903 --> 00:45:49.485
negative view of the self,
of the future and of the world,

00:45:49.485 --> 00:45:51.840
and he calls this the "negative
cognitive triad."

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:56.349
And this negative cognitive
triad is fed by specific

00:45:56.349 --> 00:46:00.797
cognitive deficits or biases.
So, depressed people show a lot

00:46:00.797 --> 00:46:04.199
of distortions in thinking.
"All-or-nothing thinking" is

00:46:04.199 --> 00:46:07.719
thinking that things are either
all good or all bad.

00:46:07.719 --> 00:46:11.260
They can't sort of see the gray
areas in between.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:15.547
There's "emotional reasoning,"
and an example of that is just

00:46:15.547 --> 00:46:18.619
if I feel like a loser I must be
a loser.

00:46:18.619 --> 00:46:21.829
Of if I feel stupid,
I must be stupid.

00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:25.342
And then "personalization,"
that is the self-blame that you

00:46:25.342 --> 00:46:29.063
often see in depressed people.
And these kinds of distortions

00:46:29.063 --> 00:46:32.750
in thinking, these distorted
ways of interpreting situations,

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:36.387
feed a kind of general negative
view of the self and

00:46:36.387 --> 00:46:40.412
hopelessness about the future.
People who are depressed also

00:46:40.412 --> 00:46:43.716
make attributions for negative
events that are internal,

00:46:43.716 --> 00:46:46.780
that is, they blame
themselves--that are stable.

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:50.739
They see bad things as lasting
forever and that are global.

00:46:50.739 --> 00:46:54.303
They see bad events as
affecting many areas of their

00:46:54.303 --> 00:46:57.446
life, which, again,
feeds their depression and

00:46:57.446 --> 00:47:01.010
their general assumption that
life is terrible.

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:04.050
And evidence that these--for
these cognitive theories,

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:07.435
that these negative cognitive
styles predict depression--one

00:47:07.435 --> 00:47:10.590
of the best studies predicting
this was a study that was

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:13.688
jointly done at Temple
University and the University of

00:47:13.688 --> 00:47:17.302
Wisconsin where they identified
first year college students with

00:47:17.302 --> 00:47:20.400
a negative cognitive or
attributional style.

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:23.127
But these were people who had
never experienced an episode of

00:47:23.127 --> 00:47:25.696
depression yet.
They then tracked them for the

00:47:25.696 --> 00:47:28.451
next two years,
and the bars here--the red bars

00:47:28.451 --> 00:47:31.985
are the percent of those with a
negative cognitive style who

00:47:31.985 --> 00:47:35.398
developed an episode of major
depression in that two and a

00:47:35.398 --> 00:47:38.752
half years versus the percent of
those without a negative

00:47:38.752 --> 00:47:41.106
cognitive style.
And as you can see,

00:47:41.106 --> 00:47:43.630
there's quite a substantial
difference between the two.

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:47.832
So prospectively,
these characteristics seem to

00:47:47.832 --> 00:47:51.030
predict your risk for
depression.

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:55.062
In turn, there is a cognitive
behavioral therapy that's based

00:47:55.062 --> 00:47:58.080
on Beck's theory.
And the major steps in this

00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:02.013
involve identifying the themes
in a person's negative thoughts

00:48:02.013 --> 00:48:05.623
and triggers for them and in
helping the person challenge

00:48:05.623 --> 00:48:09.427
those thoughts by asking them
what the evidence is for their

00:48:09.427 --> 00:48:12.715
interpretations,
whether there are other ways of

00:48:12.715 --> 00:48:15.801
looking at the situation,
how they could cope with the

00:48:15.801 --> 00:48:18.480
situation if a bad thing really
did happen.

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:22.409
So, the therapist helps the
client recognize negative

00:48:22.409 --> 00:48:26.944
beliefs or assumptions and then
challenges the truth value of

00:48:26.944 --> 00:48:29.261
these,
and then change aspects of the

00:48:29.261 --> 00:48:32.019
environment that are related to
depressive symptoms.

00:48:32.019 --> 00:48:33.998
So, they challenge your
rational thinking,

00:48:33.998 --> 00:48:36.893
but they also recognize that
there are really bad things that

00:48:36.893 --> 00:48:40.030
sometimes are going on the life
of a person who is depressed,

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:43.746
and they help them engage in
more active problem solving to

00:48:43.746 --> 00:48:48.047
change those environments.
They also teach the person ways

00:48:48.047 --> 00:48:52.497
to manage their mood so that
they don't tumble down into

00:48:52.497 --> 00:48:56.261
depression.
And these cognitive behavioral

00:48:56.261 --> 00:49:01.261
therapies have been shown to be
extremely effective and as

00:49:01.261 --> 00:49:05.559
effective in some ways as the
drug treatments.

00:49:05.559 --> 00:49:09.665
So, this is a recent study in
which they had 240 patients with

00:49:09.665 --> 00:49:13.483
major depressive disorder.
They gave them four months of

00:49:13.483 --> 00:49:17.349
acute treatment with either
cognitive behavioral therapy or

00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:20.733
Paxil, which is an SSRI.
And in eight weeks here--they

00:49:20.733 --> 00:49:23.955
also had a placebo control group
where they just got a pill,

00:49:23.955 --> 00:49:26.418
but it was a sugar pill.
At eight weeks,

00:49:26.418 --> 00:49:28.527
the Paxil group,
which is in red,

00:49:28.527 --> 00:49:31.230
and the CBT group,
which is in yellow,

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:33.812
were relatively even,
although the Paxil group had a

00:49:33.812 --> 00:49:35.989
little bit of an edge over the
CBT group.

00:49:35.989 --> 00:49:40.403
But by sixteen weeks the Paxil
and CBT group were absolutely

00:49:40.403 --> 00:49:44.592
even in terms of the percent of
people who were no longer

00:49:44.592 --> 00:49:47.287
depressed.
So, both of them resulted in

00:49:47.287 --> 00:49:49.699
about 60% of people not being
depressed.

00:49:49.699 --> 00:49:52.611
And then one of the things
that's been found over and over

00:49:52.611 --> 00:49:55.574
again with cognitive behavioral
therapy is that it not only

00:49:55.574 --> 00:49:58.639
helps people get out of a
current episode of depression,

00:49:58.639 --> 00:50:02.288
it helps to prevent future
episodes of depression because

00:50:02.288 --> 00:50:06.131
it teaches the person new coping
skills for dealing with new

00:50:06.131 --> 00:50:09.264
stressors that arise.
So, in this same study they

00:50:09.264 --> 00:50:12.329
followed the patients for an
additional twelve months.

00:50:12.329 --> 00:50:15.315
And of the Paxil group,
half were left on full-dose

00:50:15.315 --> 00:50:18.718
medications to see if you could
prevent depression by just

00:50:18.718 --> 00:50:22.450
keeping people on the meds,
and half of the Paxil group

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:26.814
were withdrawn to a placebo.
And let's look at the placebo

00:50:26.814 --> 00:50:30.144
group first here.
This is the sad news about

00:50:30.144 --> 00:50:32.626
depression.
If you just take drugs to get

00:50:32.626 --> 00:50:35.913
out of a current episode and you
go off of the drugs without

00:50:35.913 --> 00:50:37.920
having any kind of
psychotherapy,

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.710
your rate of relapse tends to
be very high.

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:45.105
So, in this group of 240,
almost 80% relapsed in the

00:50:45.105 --> 00:50:49.760
first year after going off of
the active medication.

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.445
Again, these were people who
did not get any cognitive

00:50:52.445 --> 00:50:56.110
behavioral therapy.
Of those people who stayed on

00:50:56.110 --> 00:51:00.762
Paxil alone, about 50% relapsed.
But of those people who got

00:51:00.762 --> 00:51:04.210
cognitive behavioral therapy,
only about 35% relapsed.

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:08.816
And this kind of finding has
been replicated over and over

00:51:08.816 --> 00:51:13.262
again, namely that CBT can
reduce the rate of relapse in

00:51:13.262 --> 00:51:18.326
depression quite dramatically.
I want to give you a flavor for

00:51:18.326 --> 00:51:22.062
what CBT looks like,
and I've got a short clip of a

00:51:22.062 --> 00:51:25.357
therapist who is actually,
interestingly,

00:51:25.357 --> 00:51:29.707
the daughter of Aaron Beck and
his heir in terms of the

00:51:29.707 --> 00:51:34.540
practice and development of
cognitive behavioral therapy.

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:39.472
And she's demonstrating CBT.
This is actually a role play,

00:51:39.472 --> 00:51:43.384
but it's a pretty realistic
role play, of how she goes after

00:51:43.384 --> 00:51:47.030
and helps to challenge a
gentleman's negative cognitions

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:51.377
about himself.
This is a guy in the role who's

00:51:51.377 --> 00:51:57.053
recently lost his job and is
really depressed over his job

00:51:57.053 --> 00:51:58.460
loss.
Okay.

00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:00.079
I'm going to stop there because
we're running out of time.

00:52:00.079 --> 00:52:02.030
But I just want to comment on a
couple of things that she's

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:04.416
doing.
So, you see that she's having

00:52:04.416 --> 00:52:08.723
him generate his own challenges
to his negative thoughts and

00:52:08.723 --> 00:52:12.308
write them down.
And the whole--one of the major

00:52:12.308 --> 00:52:16.493
premises in CBT is it's not just
what goes on in the therapy

00:52:16.493 --> 00:52:20.268
session that is effective.
In fact, that's a minor part of

00:52:20.268 --> 00:52:23.151
it, but what the person
practices in the time between

00:52:23.151 --> 00:52:26.052
therapy sessions.
And so, what she's doing is

00:52:26.052 --> 00:52:29.837
helping him come up with a
series of phrases he can say to

00:52:29.837 --> 00:52:33.489
himself when he feels
discouraged and plunging down.

00:52:33.489 --> 00:52:36.444
She's also helping him do
what's called "anticipatory

00:52:36.444 --> 00:52:39.569
coping," anticipating those
situations that are going to

00:52:39.569 --> 00:52:42.978
trigger negative feelings and
negative thoughts and coming up

00:52:42.978 --> 00:52:46.444
with ways of combating them in
the moment that he can enact at

00:52:46.444 --> 00:52:48.970
the time.
Cognitive behavioral therapy is

00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:51.085
very structured,
it's very focused and it's

00:52:51.085 --> 00:52:53.099
designed to be relatively
short-term.

00:52:53.099 --> 00:52:57.011
The one other major kind of
psychotherapy for depression is

00:52:57.011 --> 00:53:00.471
interpersonal therapy.
It's based on the theory that

00:53:00.471 --> 00:53:04.345
negative views of the self and
expectations about the self and

00:53:04.345 --> 00:53:08.029
relationships are based on
upbringings that really fostered

00:53:08.029 --> 00:53:10.570
these kinds of negative
self-views.

00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:14.786
And so, what you need to do is
to help clients understand their

00:53:14.786 --> 00:53:18.525
negative self-views and how
they're rooted in their past

00:53:18.525 --> 00:53:21.756
relationships.
Interpersonal therapy is less

00:53:21.756 --> 00:53:24.800
structured than cognitive
behavioral therapy,

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.360
and it's more focused on the
past.

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:30.510
CBT is very focused on the
present and dealing with the

00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:33.893
current situation that you're
facing and combating that and

00:53:33.893 --> 00:53:36.110
developing coping styles for
that.

00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:40.352
There are a few studies
comparing interpersonal therapy

00:53:40.352 --> 00:53:45.460
with CBT, but much less research
has been done on IPT than CBT.

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:48.579
But it is a positive
alternative for some people,

00:53:48.579 --> 00:53:52.219
particularly those who find
that their depression is very

00:53:52.219 --> 00:53:56.250
tied-up in recurrent themes in
their relationships that seem to

00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:58.980
happen over and over and over
again.

00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.996
But to end, the good news about
depression is that there are

00:54:01.996 --> 00:54:04.927
these alternative therapies.
There is a number of drug

00:54:04.927 --> 00:54:08.337
therapies and there are at least
two psychotherapies that good

00:54:08.337 --> 00:54:11.300
controlled research has shown
can be very helpful.

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:15.342
So, people have a choice,
and there is absolutely no need

00:54:15.342 --> 00:54:19.889
for people to stay in depression
but rather to seek out the kind

00:54:19.889 --> 00:54:24.220
of therapy that applies to and
appeals to them the most.

00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:26.000
Good.
Thanks very much.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:01.760
All right.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.330
Today, we want to talk about
investment banking, which is

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.860
different from commercial
banking.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:17.080
And today we have a guest, Jon
Fougner, who took this course

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.840
almost 10 years ago and has
been working in investment

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.660
banking since.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.980
I'll introduce him in a few
minutes, but I wanted to start

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.060
with just the elements of
investment banking, and then I

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.730
wanted to talk about changes
in it that came about after

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.720
the financial crisis of
2007 through 2009.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.220
OK.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.785
The topic is investment
banking.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:12.190
And that is a term, a
20th-century term, that first

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.060
became big and important, I'd
say, in the 1930s, but

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.970
preceded that by some years.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:26.140
And it refers to a business of
helping other businesses

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.390
create securities.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.560
If someone wants to issue
stock, they go to an

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.700
investment banker
to help them.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.130
Or if you want issue
bonds, you go to

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.680
an investment banker.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.790
It can be a corporation
that goes to the --

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.220
for-profit, it can be a
non-profit corporation, it can

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.860
be a government.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.930
I suppose even an individual,
who is incorporated, can go to

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.180
an investment bank.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.360
That's the investment
banking business.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.210
Now it's different --

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.320
it shares something with the
consulting business, because

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.600
investment bankers serve
often as consultants.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.410
A company will come to an
investment banker with a

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.010
problem, and they want to raise
money by issuing new

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.700
shares, for example, to
solve that problem.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.700
But if it's a good investment
bank, they will do more than

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.000
just issue shares for them.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.360
They'll talk about their whole
corporate strategy.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.620
So, in that sense an investment
bank looks like a

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.450
consulting firm, but they don't
do pure consulting.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.350
That makes the distinction.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.040
Maybe, they're in many ways a
favored consultant, because

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.800
they bring money.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.750
You can talk to a consultant,
who will bring you no money,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.470
and another consultant,
who has his

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.460
hands on money somewhere.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.470
And that helps a lot.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.770
The advice and the money
together help a lot.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.420
So, investment bankers are
different from traders,

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:25.840
because usually they deal with
creating something --

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.680
about making a corporation or
a government -- making it

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.160
work, enabling them to
do something that

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.240
they want to do.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.250
And then, being realistic about
it, and coming up with

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.470
the money to do it.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.010
And so, that's how investment
banking differs from

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.840
consulting
[correction: trading].

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.350
And it differs from commercial
banking in that a pure

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.660
investment bank does not
accept deposits.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.680
You can't go to your investment
bank and say, I'd

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.920
like to open a savings
account.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.170
They don't do it.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.839
I'm talking about a pure
investment bank.

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:12.580
But let me just give you
something about this business.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.340
I'm going to come in a moment
to pointing out that most

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.660
investment banking businesses
are not pure investment banks.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.310
But let's talk about what a
pure investment bank does.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.055
It does underwriting
of securities.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.120
That means --

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.450
suppose you're a company and
you want to issue shares.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.890
You need someone to go to bat
for you, someone who knows the

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.880
kind of people, who might
buy your shares, and

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.230
can vouch for you.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.150
So in some sense, it's
a reputation thing.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:56.010
The investment bank has contacts
among people who make

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.180
big investments, and they manage
the issuance of your

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.950
new shares, and that's called
an underwriting.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.150
If it's the first time you're
issuing shares, it's called an

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.560
IPO, or ''initial public
offering.'' So, you're a

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.240
private company, it's just you
and a few friends own the

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.120
company, but now you want to go
public, you would generally

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.680
go to an investment bank,
and talk to them

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.540
about how to do it.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.610
And the investment bank would
solve that problem for you by

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.900
doing an underwriting.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.200
So, traditionally there's two
kinds of underwriting --

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.020
Also, there's also something
called a ''seasoned

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:47.540
offering,'' and that means, for
a company that has already

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.780
gone public, and it already has
shares traded, so that the

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.640
shares are seasoned, but you
want to issue more shares.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.550
So, you can go to an
investment bank

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.320
to do that, as well.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.430
OK.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.920
There's two kinds of deals.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:10.190
There's a ''bought deal,''
and then there's a ''best

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:18.320
efforts.'' With a bought
deal, the investment

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.180
bank buys your shares.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.870
They go in and say, you know, we
know that we can market for

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:24.600
your shares.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.460
We will buy them ourselves and
resell them on the market.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.350
A best efforts offering is one,
where the investment bank

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.310
doesn't buy it and doesn't
promise anything.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.790
They say, we'll make
our best efforts

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.040
to place this offering.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.910
So, those are the basic
things that they do.

00:06:51.936 --> 00:06:58.230
The methods that they use are
regulated by the Securities

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.370
and Exchange Commission
in order to make --

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.840
the SEC in the United States,
and regulated similarly in

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.090
other countries.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.150
So, that's the basic investment
banking business.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:22.260
So, if you're thinking of where
to place yourself, I

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:30.020
think investment banking suits
very well people who are --

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.570
it's not good for
autistic people.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.960
If you're autistic,
be a trader.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.990
Then, you just get on the phone,
and you buy and sell

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:42.410
all day, and you can be rude,
and you can have coffee stains

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.680
on your shirt, and you don't
have to know anything about

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.880
classical music.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.910
OK?

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.930
But investment bankers
are a different --

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.340
I see Jon is laughing.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.740
Tell me, what you know
what classical music.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.210
I assume that was a part of
your training at Goldman.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.460
He says no.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:03.580
It's a whole different
industry.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:08.430
So, if you go to the symphony
and look around, you'll see

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.900
lots of investment
bankers there.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.550
But you won't see any traders.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.510
You nod on that
[POINTING AT JON FOUGNER],

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.760
maybe.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.940
We talked about moral hazard.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.539
I think that an important part
of what investment banks do

00:08:24.539 --> 00:08:27.860
is, solve a moral hazard
problem, and that problem is,

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.830
that companies, who issue
shares, don't have a

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.240
reputation.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.330
And so, what do I care, I'll
issue shares, right before

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.800
we're going to go bankrupt.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.600
We know inside that we're going
to go bankrupt, so hey,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.820
let's just see, if we can milk
this company, before the

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.880
public knows it, and
issue shares.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.515
That's a moral hazard.

00:08:48.515 --> 00:08:52.550
And the investment bank
is in business to

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.010
prevent that moral hazard.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:59.880
They do the due diligence, they
check you out, and then

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.880
after that, people are
more trusting of you.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.460
So, I think investment banking
is built around trust, it's

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.940
establishing trust.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.980
So, that's how it differs from
a lot of -- that's why it's

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:21.020
important that these people be
cultivated and impressive.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.650
They tend to be well-spoken.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:27.490
I can ask Jon, whether he agrees
on all this, but it's

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.460
my impression, you can tell when
the investment bankers

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.710
walk in the room.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.240
They dress differently,
they look differently.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.070
I don't know what it is.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.690
It's something about reputation
-- it's what it's

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.940
built around.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:54.260
The investment banking
industry --

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.050
let me just --

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.260
since I'm talking about the
nature of investment banking

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.740
and since we have a Goldman
Sachs representative here.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:14.050
I put on your reading list a
book as an optional reading by

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:29.670
Charles Ellis called The
Partnership, and it's a

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.035
history of Goldman Sachs.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:41.150
Goldman Sachs was an investment
bank until just

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:45.720
very recently, and we'll
talk about that.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.770
They're still in the investment
banking business,

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:52.280
but now they're officially
a commercial bank.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.310
It's an old, venerable firm, and
Goldman Sachs emerged in

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:02.650
the early 21st century, as,
I think, the most highly

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:06.060
respected and esteemed
investment bank in the world.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:13.725
Amazingly successful, and
amazingly well-respected.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:18.740
Ellis wrote a book just
a few years --

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.310
Ellis is on the Yale
Corporation.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:27.250
He's a distinguished businessmen
and author

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:31.200
himself, and he wrote a book
about Goldman Sachs, which is

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.800
largely admiring.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.200
Like, how did this happen?

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.110
How did this phenomenon of
Goldman Sachs come about?

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:43.100
And I suggested --

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:43.585
I didn't assign --

00:11:43.585 --> 00:11:46.240
I suggested, you read one
chapter, which was called

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.460
Principles.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:52.830
And it says something about
Goldman Sachs, and it refers

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:57.400
to, in that chapter, the
chairman of Goldman Sachs,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:03.240
John Whitehead, in the 1970s
wrote down a list of

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.830
principles that guide
Goldman Sachs.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.190
And Ellis seems admiring
of these principles.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:12.610
Not everyone would agree.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.680
It's a matter of taste,
I guess, if anything.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.960
Whitehead is now --

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.150
I just looked it up --

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.820
he's 88 years old, and is
retired from Goldman, must

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.210
have retired some years ago.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.220
What kind of an organization?

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.270
Ellis says, that the thing
that struck him about the

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.770
organization is loyalty.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:35.620
But that's not alone, that
people feel a strong loyalty

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.500
toward their company.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.470
That's not on Whitehead's
list.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.280
So, Whitehead's list.
What is his first

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.670
principle of Goldman Sachs?

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:50.360
"Our client's interests always
come first." These sound a

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.680
little bit like bromides.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:56.420
I'm sorry, but I read them
thinking, it is the most

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.770
successful investment bank in
the world, so maybe there's

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:00.530
something beyond --

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.990
I think, there is something
beyond platitudes here.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:06.760
Second, "our assets are
people, capital, and

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:14.630
reputation." That's a coincident
with what I said.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:17.750
"Uncompromising determination to
achieve excellence." Well,

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:21.370
everybody says that, so maybe
we'll discount that.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:25.830
"We stress creativity and
imagination." Well, those are

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:29.040
sort of bromides, maybe.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.860
Then, Whitehead issued
some guidelines --

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.370
this is also in that
chapter later --

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.790
for Goldman Sachs employees, and
these seem to be a little

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.040
bit more candid.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.930
''The boss usually decides, not
the assistant treasurer.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:50.791
Do you know the boss?'' That's
something I've learned from my

00:13:50.791 --> 00:13:53.260
own interaction with people --

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.050
the boss really does decide,
and Goldman Sachs

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:58.190
goes for the top.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.650
And maybe this is obnoxious, I
don't know -- they don't want

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:03.950
to talk with underlings.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.400
''You never learn anything when
you're talking.'' That

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.440
means, be a good listener.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.250
''The respect of one person
is worth more than the

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:16.580
acquaintance with 100.''
''There's nothing worse than

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.330
an unhappy client.'' The
one thing that --

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.100
I don't if it's on Whitehead's
list --

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.310
but I think it says something
about investment banking, and

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:29.240
that Ellis says, is that
they shun publicity.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.500
They don't want to be in the
newspaper, they want to be

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.200
known by the president.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.830
They want to be known by
a few prominent people.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.520
They're kind of social
climbers, in a way.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:45.530
But it's all built around some
basic principles of service,

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:48.250
and they want to be talking to
the top guy, and they don't

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:49.500
want to be in the newspaper.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:57.000
I'm going to quote
Ellis on this.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.060
Now I'm quoting Charlie Ellis.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:03.850
I call him Charlie.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:04.560
I know him.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.810
He's a friend of mine.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.540
"Making money, always and no
exceptions, was a principle of

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.910
Goldman Sachs.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.460
Nothing was ever done
for prestige.

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.730
In fact, the most prestigious
clients were often charged the

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:24.140
most. Absolute loyalty to the
firm and to the partnership

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.390
was expected.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.950
Personal anonymity was
almost a core value.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:37.250
The real culture of Goldman
Sachs was a unique blend of

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:41.780
drive for making money and the
characteristics of family, in

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.130
ways that the Chinese, Arabs,
and old Europeans would well

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:46.550
understand.''

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:52.410
So, I'm giving you a flavor of
what an investment bank is.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.220
You might be repelled by it.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.390
You know, is making money
so important?

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.210
And if you are repelled by it,
you probably don't want to

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.490
work for Goldman Sachs.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.890
On the other hand, they're
kind of respecting some

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:07.790
economic principles, right?

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:11.200
Working for a firm like this,
you can make huge amounts of

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.770
money, and then at the
end, you can give

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.200
it all away to charity.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.330
And that's the new capitalism,
right?

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.070
So, what's wrong with that?

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:23.210
What are you going to
do with all this?

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:27.060
If you make $100 million, what
are you going to do with it?

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.840
You're going to give
it away, right?

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.090
I mentioned at the beginning, I
mentioned Andrew Carnegie's

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:37.200
book, The Gospel of Wealth.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.270
Maybe that's, what this
is all about.

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.400
On the other hand, some of them
don't give it away, and

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.650
some of them live lavishly.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:48.390
Different people have different
impressions of this

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:49.599
business --

00:16:49.599 --> 00:16:52.569
but I want to make sure I have
time for our guest and I'm

00:16:52.569 --> 00:16:54.105
sort of running out of time.

00:16:54.105 --> 00:16:58.319
I wanted to talk about what has
happened in the crisis.

00:16:58.319 --> 00:17:02.190
There's so much to say
about this topic.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:05.220
Maybe, I should talk first
about the first crisis.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:19.880
In 1933, the US Congress passed
the Glass-Stegall Act,

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:24.480
which forced investment
banks --

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.260
it prevented investment banks
from doing commercial banking,

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.370
or commercial banks from doing
investment banking.

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:37.660
It split them in two, and it
said you have to decide, are

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.350
you a commercial back, or are
you an investment bank?

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:45.940
The Glass-Steagall Act was the
act that created the FDIC, the

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:51.600
Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, the first

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:57.040
successful national deposit
insurance act in the world.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.840
And part of it -- it makes sense
-- if you're going to

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.400
insure the commercial banks, you
better watch what they're

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.120
doing and prevent them from
doing dangerous business.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.520
So, the dangerous business was
investment banking, and they

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.720
forced companies to decide.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:15.740
So, J.P. Morgan, which was doing
both investment banking

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:20.290
and commercial banking in
1933 had to decide.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.160
What is it?

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.300
Investment banking or
commercial banking?

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.960
So, they picked commercial
banking, and that means, they

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.960
fired all their investment
bankers.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:33.000
So, these guys regrouped and
they formed an investment

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.780
bank, called Morgan Stanley.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:43.140
Stanley was a Yale graduate and
Morgan was, I think -- not

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.690
J.P. Morgan, it was
his grandson.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:51.790
Morgan died around 1911.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.250
And so, those were two
separate ones.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:56.080
J.P. Morgan, commercial bank.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.150
Morgan Stanley, investment
bank.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:03.540
But since then, we've repealed
the Glass-Steagall Act, and

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:09.090
that occurred with the
Gramm-Leach Act [correction:

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.340
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act] of --

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.060
what was that --

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.580
1999.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:20.120
Well, Gramm-Leach[-Bliley]

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:29.060
repealed Glass-Steagall, and
now these businesses, they

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.560
generally do the same
business, both

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.900
commercial and --

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.800
yes, Gramm-Leach[-Bliley]

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:44.670
was 1999.

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:50.270
Since then, as you recall, we've
had a financial crisis.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:54.360
And in that financial crisis,
Glass-Steagall got brought up

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.660
again, because it seemed that
the crisis was related to a

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:04.660
number of shenanigans that
firms were undertaking.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:10.670
And the government had to bail
out commercial banks.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.810
We talked about this, and
it's very controversial.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:19.390
So, the question is, did these
banks get in trouble, because

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:20.560
we repealed Glass-Steagall?

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.540
A lot of people came
on saying that.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:28.230
These banks were doing all kinds
of screwy things that

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:33.610
were dangerous, and we're
insuring them, so it can't be.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:35.430
So, a lot of people said,
we have to go back.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:39.000
There was some inherent wisdom
in Glass-Steagall that we've

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.800
lost. And this was debated.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.510
Now incidentally --

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:43.900
I didn't mention this --

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.060
Glass-Steagall was somehow
confined to the United States.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.820
Outside of the United States, I
don't know if there was any

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.060
country, but as far as I know
the U.S. was the only

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.400
one that did it.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.180
So, outside of the United
States they had what was

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.995
called universal banking.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.160
And these banks outside of
the U.S. were doing both

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.500
investment banking and
commercial banking.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.140
They sailed right through the
whole century without being

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.430
divided up.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:17.340
So, the reason why we got
Gramm-Leach[-Bliley]

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:23.400
was, that people started to
say, you know, we're at a

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.120
competitive disadvantage.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.540
We Americans are at a
competitive disadvantage to

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:32.910
Europe, because we can't do
both, and they have more

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:34.370
freedom than we.

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:39.530
And so eventually, in 1999, we
said, they could do both, so

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:44.310
that the U.S. also became a
universal banking country.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:45.875
But then problems arose.

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.810
And the problems were --

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.960
Paul Volcker, who was chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:10.550
in the late '70s, early '80s
proposed something called the

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:13.570
Volcker Rule.

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:32.620
And the Volcker Rule was
not a full return to

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.540
Glass-Steagall, but --

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:38.650
and this is now in the
Dodd-Frank Act.

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:48.550
It's Section 619.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:51.360
It doesn't say Volcker Rule
there, but that's what it is,

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:56.275
and it prohibits proprietary
trading at commercial banks.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:07.330
And it also says, that
commercial banks can't own

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:11.944
hedge funds or private
equity [addition:

00:23:11.944 --> 00:23:13.194
private equity funds].

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:21.240
So, that was the Volcker
Rule that was put in.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:25.450
There was also another rule
added, which is analogous to

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:26.480
the Dodd-Frank Act [correction:
analogous to the

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.490
Volcker Rule], also.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:34.150
And this is in the Dodd-Frank
Act of 2010.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.560
There was a senator.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:46.150
Her name was Blanche Lincoln, a
Democrat from Arkansas, who

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:50.200
proposed the Lincoln Rule --

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.470
unrelated to Abraham Lincoln,
as far as I know.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:57.970
And the Lincoln Rule was --

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:10.660
or Lincoln Amendment, and that
is Section 716 of Dodd-Frank.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.052
It says that --

00:24:12.052 --> 00:24:19.130
it doesn't prohibit banks
dealing in swaps, but it said

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:28.790
swap dealers are barred
access to Fed

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:32.100
window, discount window.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.390
And so effectively, it prevents
banks from dealing in

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:39.210
swaps anymore.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:47.690
As a result of this, Goldman
Sachs has got to shut down --

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:51.110
or it appears that --

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.510
the Volcker Rule says
banks have until

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:56.240
October 2011 to comply.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:01.040
So, it means that Goldman Sachs
has to shut down --

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.780
Goldman Sachs had to become a
commercial bank, too, so it's

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.420
no longer --

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:09.380
it's an official commercial
bank now.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.320
And because of the Volcker Rule,
it appears that it has

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:17.680
to shut down its proprietary
trading, which was a huge part

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.720
of its profits.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.390
And Goldman Sachs will never be
the same again, apparently.

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:29.726
But it's not clear,
what will happen.

00:25:29.726 --> 00:25:33.570
It depends all on how Dodd-Frank
is enforced.

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:36.950
I think, that the people that
are in the banking industry

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.250
are going to try to claim, that
some of the activity that

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.340
was done by their proprietary
traders --

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:49.080
that is, people who were trading
the market on --

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.760
true investment banking
shouldn't involve the

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.620
investment banker buying and
selling securities trying to

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.990
make a profit.

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:57.640
That's not underwriting
of securities,

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.940
that's proprietary trading.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:04.450
The Volcker Rule says, that you
pretty much can't do it

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:07.870
anymore, unless you're a pure
investment bank, but if you're

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.600
a commercial bank, you can't
do it anymore, and they're

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.610
kind of forced to become
a commercial bank.

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:16.500
But they're going to try to
steer around these rules, and

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:17.850
I think that maybe they can.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:21.120
They'll re-define something
that looks something like

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:30.470
proprietary trading, and
then continue to do

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.990
what they're doing.

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:32.060
We'll have to see.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.770
These things are long
and arduous.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:43.270
You know, one thing that strikes
me about finance is,

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:45.520
that it's so rules-based.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:51.770
There are so many laws, there
are so many lawyers, that

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:56.040
nobody can grasp the magnitude
of the regulations that these

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.430
people live under.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.530
And you see these landmark
bills, but none of us

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:04.610
understands them, because the
real content of them is

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:11.270
involved in hundreds of pages of
legal documents, that never

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.560
cease to amaze me with
their complexity.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.000
Let me tell you something about
shadow banking, which is

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.200
relevant here.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:34.665
The term ''shadow banking,'' I
think of that as coming from a

00:27:34.665 --> 00:27:38.550
term that I first heard from
people at Pimco just within

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.800
the last five years or so.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.475
Or maybe it goes back
further than that.

00:27:43.475 --> 00:27:48.330
It refers to a new kind of
semi-banking system.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.260
What are shadow banks?

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.760
These are companies that are
acting like commercial banks,

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.100
but they're technically not.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.920
So, they're not regulated
as commercial banks.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.860
And in many cases,
the investment

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:07.130
banks were shadow banks.

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:13.010
I'll give you an example of
Lehman Brothers, which was a

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:15.030
pure investment bank.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.580
It's now bankrupt, it's gone.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:22.010
It was a pure investment bank,
so it wasn't regulated as a

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:24.210
commercial bank.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:32.750
This was before the Volcker
rule, before Dodd-Frank, and

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:37.640
they went bankrupt in 2008, and
it was the worst moment in

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.260
the financial crisis.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.000
Why did they go bankrupt?

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.470
Well, there's a reading on your
reading list by Professor

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:53.720
Gary Gorton here at Yale, who
argues that Lehman, like many

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:59.740
other investment banks, was
financing a lot of proprietary

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:05.330
investments by issuing repos,
or by dealing in repos.

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:06.220
What is a repo?

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.515
That's short for repurchase
agreement.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:16.900
The banking crisis, that we saw
in 2008, was substantially

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:20.345
a run on the repo.

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.050
So, here's what happened,
according to Gorton and others

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:28.240
who agree with him.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:32.340
Investment banks, like Lehman
Brothers, were not regulated

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.890
like commercial banks, and as
long as they didn't accept

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:38.470
deposits, they didn't
have to be regulated

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:39.420
as commercial banks.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.030
So, they could do what they
want, and they were considered

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:44.280
underwriters, so fine,
do whatever you want.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.710
Well, not quite, but they
weren't heavily regulated, the

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:48.780
way commercial banks were.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.130
And what Lehman Brother started
to do is, to make

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:56.210
heavy investments in subprime
securities and other

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:59.290
securities by effectively
borrowing

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:01.650
through the repo market.

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:03.400
What is the repo market?

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:09.620
It's a market, in which a
company effectively borrows

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:16.900
money by effectively selling
some securities it owns with

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:21.650
an agreement to repurchase the
security at a later date.

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:25.285
They're short-term loans, and
in fact, collateralized by

00:30:25.285 --> 00:30:28.340
some security that they own.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:31.480
What it was, it was almost
the same as a deposit.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.760
They were short-term loans
that someone could

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.040
withdraw at any time.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.470
The someone wouldn't be some
mother and father with their

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:40.350
small savings account.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.520
It would be some bigger,
probably

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.390
institutional investor.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:49.970
But these were acting like
banks, like commercial banks,

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:53.070
because there could be a run
on these banks the same way

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:55.050
there's a run on the
commercial banks.

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:57.450
If anyone starts fearing that
Lehman Brothers is going to

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:00.200
fail, they all want to take
their money out, which means,

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.750
they don't renew their repos.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:07.920
And so Lehman Brothers failed,
when the housing market

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:12.240
declined, the value of its
subprime securities declined.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.665
People, who were lending it
money through repos, got wind

00:31:16.665 --> 00:31:19.870
of this, and they stopped
wanting to do it, so it was

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:21.440
like a run on Lehman Brothers.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:26.180
And Lehman Brothers could
not be saved, if it

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:29.470
weren't for a bailout.

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:34.995
The government had already
bailed out Bear Sterns, and it

00:31:34.995 --> 00:31:41.000
had helped Merrill Lynch, which
was failing as well, and

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.460
they decided not to bail
everybody out, so they let

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:47.630
Lehman Brothers fail.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:52.540
So now, the reaction to that is,
that we can't let shadow

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:58.470
banking go unregulated,
and Dodd-Frank is

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:00.095
part of that reaction.

00:32:04.176 --> 00:32:11.190
So now, investment banking
is substantially

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:14.470
altered by these laws.

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:21.510
And still, of course, it's a
very important business.

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:23.990
The United States has
traditionally been the most

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:27.110
important country in investment
banking, but it

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:35.980
continues that Europe and Asia
are also important, very

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:39.700
important participants in
investment banking.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.260
Growing, I think.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:47.460
The financial crisis has put
something of a damper on the

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.930
business for a while, but
I think, it seems

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:50.730
to be coming back.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:57.170
The latest news is, that the
investment banking business is

00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:03.300
starting to look more stable
and prosperous.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:07.410
So, what I want to do
now is invite --

00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:09.380
let me just do a brief
introduction.

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:14.560
So, Jon Fougner took this class,
I think it was 2002,

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.710
and then, he served as my
research assistant for a book

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:21.355
I was writing, called The New
Financial Order, so I got to

00:33:21.355 --> 00:33:22.605
know him better.

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:30.520
The important thing for this
lecture is, that you worked

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:37.030
for Goldman Sachs, and got to
know people there, and now

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:39.600
he's working for Facebook.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.940
You've heard of this
company, right?

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:45.460
I thought it would be
interesting to have him back

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:49.770
to give his impressions of what
life was like after ECON

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:55.380
252, of what Goldman
Sachs was like --

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:58.310
at least the old
Goldman Sachs.

00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:01.699
And I think, it's interesting
to hear about Facebook, too,

00:34:01.699 --> 00:34:08.060
because it's a different kind of
culture, and I'm interested

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:08.830
in culture.

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:14.260
It's more of a tech business.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:18.110
I'm interested to hear, if they
have anything like the

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:21.730
Goldman Sachs principles,
or they enunciate

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:23.690
them the same way.

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:28.050
So, I'll bring Jon up, and
I'll let him continue.

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:29.659
JON FOUGNER: Very well.

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:30.860
Thank you Professor Shiller.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:34.790
And Professor Shiller has
promised, that I'll be

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:38.830
well-spoken, and well-dressed,
and a bunch of other things,

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:40.840
good, bad, or otherwise.

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.170
I'm not sure, if I'll live up to
any of those expectations,

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:44.700
but hopefully I can
share a little

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:45.950
bit about this business.

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.530
How many of you are considering
going into

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:53.780
investment banking?

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:58.290
Maybe about 30%, or so.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:34:59.040
OK.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:02.070
And how many of you
are on Facebook?

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:03.320
OK.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.200
And how many of you are

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.260
considering working at Facebook?

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.350
OK, so maybe we'll add
a few more to that

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:11.900
by the end of this.

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:14.140
The goal for the next half hour
is really to help you

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.040
think about, whether banking
might be the right next step

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.660
for you after college, and for
those of you who say yes, to

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:23.250
share a few tips on
how to think about

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:25.050
getting into the business.

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:28.450
I'll give a little bit of my
background, kind of a context

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:31.670
for my reflections on the
industry, so you can take them

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:34.950
with a grain of salt, share some
anecdotes from banking

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:39.590
during the debt boom, and then
also give a few tips, or steps

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:42.870
that you could take today, if
you're interested in it.

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:44.470
So, a little bit on
my background.

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:47.790
Junior summer, I went to work
for a large investment bank,

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:50.310
as Professor Shiller mentioned,
and I really

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:53.180
enjoyed the work, knew that
I wanted to go back to it.

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:56.070
But I had never lived abroad,
because, as you all know, your

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:58.520
junior year here at Yale,
there's a lot going on with

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.720
extracurriculars, and so many
people don't go abroad.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.410
I went to see Charles Hill --

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:06.330
now how many folks are familiar
with Charles Hill?

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.900
Fabulous negotiator.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:11.080
And I said, Professor Hill, how
can I negotiate to go back

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.450
to this job a year later,
so I can do a

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:14.530
Fulbright in the meantime?

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:16.840
So, he taught me all this
jiu-jitsu, and it ended up

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:22.350
working out, and I did a year in
Norway, and then came back

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:23.400
full time to banking.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.710
Now, as you probably know,
a lot of analysts go into

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:28.250
banking, they do it for two
years, maybe do private

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:31.360
equity, hedge fund, maybe do
an MBA afterwards, and

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.750
something like 15% might stay
on, get promoted, and become

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:36.710
career-track bankers.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:39.720
When I was working on Wall
Street, this was the peak of

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.570
the most recent private
equity boom and the

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:43.960
associated debt boom.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.820
And so, recruiting to private
equity had reached such a

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:51.750
fever pitch, that literally 16
months before the start date

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:55.360
for these jobs, analysts were
getting calls from recruiters,

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.250
doing interviews, and
actually making

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:59.310
commitments to joining companies.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:02.140
And I knew, I was interested in
tech, and so I became very

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.920
close to signing with a
technology private equity

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:07.450
fund, that I admire still very
much to this day, but I

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:10.750
actually decided that I wanted
to work in tech itself, and so

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:13.240
the last three and a half years,
as you mentioned, I've

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.830
been working at Facebook
working on our social

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:18.560
advertisement strategy.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.880
So, a little bit about inside
the banking role.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.540
It may sound a little bit
funny to talk about the

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:27.020
investment banking division of
an investment bank, but that's

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.820
what we'll do for the
next 15 minutes.

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.990
And by that, I really mean, just
the part of the business

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:34.480
that Professor Shiller
mentioned, giving advice to

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:40.460
CEOs and CFOs about financing,
and mergers and acquisitions.

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:42.300
So if you see this logo--

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:43.720
and that makes you smile --

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:47.180
I see a few smiles, maybe
a couple grimaces --

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.250
if it makes you smile,
it's a good sign that

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:50.720
banking may be for you.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.760
You think about two,
three, four --

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.910
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: They
don't understand that.

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:55.135
That's an Excel logo.

00:37:55.135 --> 00:37:56.156
JON FOUGNER: That's
an Excel logo.

00:37:56.156 --> 00:37:57.995
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
What are you driving at?

00:37:57.995 --> 00:37:59.980
JON FOUGNER: That's an Excel
logo, and these are Excel

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:03.310
models, and they go on and on.

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:04.780
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
You mean, they're

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:05.155
going to be a nerd.

00:38:05.155 --> 00:38:06.080
Is that what you're saying?

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:09.600
JON FOUGNER: Yes, if by that
you mean you want to feel

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.850
comfortable with the technical
aspect of the role, yes,

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:13.100
absolutely.

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:19.980
Especially at the junior
level, where --

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.880
you mentioned some of the
relationship aspects of

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.050
banking, but at the junior
level, really your core

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:27.910
responsibility is building
out these models.

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:30.160
So, if you think about working
on that until 4 in the morning

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:34.300
maybe two nights in a row, maybe
20 nights in a row, and

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:39.100
that's exciting to you,
that's a good sign.

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:44.180
So, how many of you have gone
online to Open Yale to see

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.035
Stephen Schwarzman's talk
from this class

00:38:46.035 --> 00:38:48.300
from three years ago?

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.150
One, two.

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:52.550
Two enterprising users
of the internet.

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:54.395
I would strongly encourage
everyone to do that.

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.487
One of the things, that he
talks about is that in

00:38:59.487 --> 00:39:02.530
banking, there's not a ton of
flexibility for getting the

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:03.670
numbers wrong.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:06.480
As the analyst, you really
need to nail the details.

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.760
And primarily, what we're
talking about there, is

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:12.700
building operating transaction
and valuation models that

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:13.860
describe your clients,
and other

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:15.680
companies, and their industry.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:18.840
And then, the information from
those models, along with

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.400
research you find by hook and by
crook on the internet, from

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.060
your colleague, wherever you
can, kind of comes together

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.360
into presentations, polished
pitch books to help win a

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.790
piece of business.

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:33.190
So, that could be an IPO, a
merger advisory, as you

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:37.400
mentioned, and once you've won
that piece of business, then

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.930
you as the analyst really are
the organizing principal for

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:43.070
getting this deal across
the finish line.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:45.360
Dealing with the accountants,
working with the lawyers,

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.920
other bankers, even competitors
who might also be

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.230
working on the deal, and then,
of course, your client, and

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:52.260
whichever counter-party
your client is selling

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.280
to or buying from.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.170
So, it's a fair amount
of responsibility.

00:39:57.170 --> 00:40:00.190
Typical investment banking deal
team, the core team is

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:01.260
pretty lean.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:06.380
Maybe one each of an analyst,
associate VP, and MD, and if

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:11.190
you decide to and are given the
opportunity to continue

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:14.390
working in investment banking
on a career basis, then you

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:16.720
will gain a little bit more
control over your week to week

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.290
and month to month schedule
as you become more senior.

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:21.810
But even at a senior level,
investment banking is really

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:25.670
considered an always on-call
client service profession.

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:28.750
Now, one of the advantages of
this very lean deal team is,

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:31.840
that there's plenty of
responsibility to go around.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:34.695
So, if you raise your hand and
say, yes, I can take on some

00:40:34.695 --> 00:40:36.880
of this work, that might by
default fall to some of my

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.590
associates, and you do it
without making mistakes,

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:41.520
you're going to be able to get
more and more responsibility,

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.650
learn more and more
on the job.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.420
One of my favorite projects
that I worked on was a

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:49.180
proposed venture capital
transaction, where we were

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.380
looking at investing in eight
different operating companies,

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.780
and because the team was that
lean, I was actually able to

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.800
basically take on leading the
due diligence on these eight

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.005
different companies.

00:40:59.005 --> 00:41:01.960
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: Before
you go ahead, why do

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:06.030
the managing directors
have zero grey hairs?

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:06.685
JON FOUGNER: Well,
I'm just assuming

00:41:06.685 --> 00:41:07.935
it's all gone by then.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:14.500
That's a median, the mean might
be a little bit higher.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:17.300
High variance.

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.840
So, I would --

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.766
Was that the nerdy comment
you were looking for?

00:41:21.766 --> 00:41:26.470
So, I might encourage you to
think about these roles as an

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:30.120
investment in your career,
where what you put in, of

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:33.430
course, is long hours -- maybe
100 hours a week for a couple

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:34.790
of years --

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:38.180
and what you get out, is a
number of things, including a

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.110
skill set that's really valued
and respected, not just in

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:44.270
finance, but around the business
world, exposures to

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:47.910
CFOs and how they think about
problems. If you decide to

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:50.920
continue on as a career banker,
participation and

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.920
success that you'll help create
for your company.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.860
And then, of course, a network
of very smart, eager peers,

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:59.810
like the folks in this room,
who then fan out across the

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:02.220
finance industry.

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.550
So, as I mentioned, I was in
banking during the debt boom,

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:08.020
and there was such a peak in
transaction that people

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.150
started calling it Merger
Mondays, this expectation that

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:13.320
before the bell at the beginning
of the week, there'd

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.070
be a $20 billion, or $30
billion, $40 billion

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:18.100
transaction that would
be announced.

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:20.560
And there was so much enthusiasm
for this sort of

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:24.190
transaction that even financial
institutions, which,

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:26.492
conventional wisdom told
us, couldn't be LBO'ed

00:42:26.492 --> 00:42:27.335
[clarification: LBO stands for
leveraged buyout], because

00:42:27.335 --> 00:42:30.090
their balance sheets were
already so levered, actually

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:33.990
became considered targets
for leveraged buyouts.

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:36.060
And arguably the peak of this
was, when Blackstone

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:39.740
themselves, one of the fathers
of the buyout industry, filed

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.180
an S1, and in fact became a
publicly traded company, which

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:44.250
they are to this day.

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:48.560
Your final task as a banking
analyst is to create a deal

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:51.920
toy, when you successfully
created a transaction.

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.460
Now, this particular one used
to have water in it and

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:58.190
glittering fish, and at the
time I thought it was very

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:00.930
pretty, but I would just invite
you maybe, when you

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:03.970
create your deals toys, don't
picture your client swimming

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:06.440
with the fishes.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:07.650
Not the best idea.

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:11.310
And then, this is a safe for a
bank, which, of course, is

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:13.990
logical, safes are in a bank.

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:15.970
But this is actually an
especially fun toy, because

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:18.270
you pull this handle here,
and then actually

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:21.100
this one opens up.

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:24.280
That was my idea of fun when I
was a banker, so you again

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:25.940
should take it with
a grain of salt.

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:28.690
This is a snow globe -- you
shake it upside down, which is

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:30.550
a lot of fun, as well.

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:33.550
But again, just in terms of the
metaphor, and I have only

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:36.510
myself blame -- maybe I
was sleep deprived --

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:39.380
I guess, maybe don't show your
client's capital structure

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:44.040
literally under water, when
you design your deal toys.

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.890
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: Are
you saying that investment

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:48.090
bankers have a childish side?

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:50.630
You say, deal toys.

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:52.500
I was presenting them as
going to the symphony.

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.510
What are you presenting
them as?

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:57.470
JON FOUGNER: I can't claim, I
ever made it to the symphony,

00:43:57.470 --> 00:44:00.610
when I was an analyst, but a
number of my colleagues were

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:04.110
on the boards, involved
philanthropically with those

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:04.840
organizations.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.580
But yes, I think that we have
this creative energy and

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:08.710
creative spirit.

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:11.310
I think, there's a lot of
creativity in finance that, as

00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:13.930
Stephen Schwarzman mentioned
in his talk, at the senior

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:16.095
levels, when you're dreaming how
to combine companies, how

00:44:16.095 --> 00:44:18.780
to finance companies, how to
deal with new regulation, as

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:19.290
you mentioned.

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:22.180
But at the analyst level,
maybe not quite as much.

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:24.300
So maybe, there is that creative
spark, that's just

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.310
trying to find its way out, one

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:30.190
mischievous way or another.

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:31.020
But anyway, this was the

00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:33.240
landscape, when I left banking.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.020
That was September 2007.

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:38.420
And then six months after that,
as Professor Shiller

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:42.840
mentioned, Bear Sterns sold in
a fire sale to J.P. Morgan,

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:45.690
and then six months after that,
September 2008, we saw

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:50.090
Merrill Lynch narrowly avert
liquidation, become the asset

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:52.445
management brand of
Bank of America,

00:44:52.445 --> 00:44:55.470
which it still is today.

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:59.220
That same week, Lehman Brothers
collapsed under the

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:03.120
weight of those mortgages,
suffered a bank run, and was

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.380
not bailed out, was liquidated,
some of their

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:07.680
investment banking and capital
markets assets sold to

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.790
Barclays in bankruptcy.

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:13.330
A week after that, what a lot of
people thought would never

00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:15.770
happen, did happen, and Goldman
Sachs and Morgan

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:17.880
Stanley went to the Federal
Reserve, and asked to become

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.430
commercial banks, which
technically they still are

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:24.060
today, as Professor
Shiller mentioned.

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:27.600
Now, that having been said, if
you take Charles Gasparino's

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.480
account of this era, this
was the end of an

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.300
era for Wall Street.

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:36.400
That having been said,
investment banking continued

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.380
at firms all around the world,
some of these diversified

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:43.030
conglomerates, and also at a
burgeoning slate of so-called

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:45.340
independent advisory shops.

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:49.360
So, these are folks like
Evercore, Lazard, Greenhill.

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:51.900
And if you're interested in
learning about finance,

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.630
investment banking is not the
only way to get into it.

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:57.240
There are also, for example,
the so-called alternative

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:00.400
asset managers, private
equity hedge funds.

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:03.590
Folks like KKR, Carlyle,
Bridgewater, who I believe

00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:05.650
still recruits here on campus.

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:08.630
And then, out where I live in
California, you have the heart

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:10.960
of the venture capital industry,
especially around

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.110
the information technology
industry.

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:16.250
So, folks like Kleiner,
Sequoia, Benchmark.

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:19.070
They may not be recruiting on
campus, and they may not even

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:21.400
be open to hiring
undergraduates, but some of

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:24.160
their competitors are.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.590
So, if that's interesting to
you, maybe we'll just touch on

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:29.770
a few steps that you
can take today.

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:32.070
Obviously, you're already doing
plenty of this, without

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:33.520
anyone having to remind you.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:37.360
Things like taking the right
classes, doing well in them,

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.570
researching the firms you
want to apply to.

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:41.520
Just three that I'll touch on.

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.010
Taking advantage of the
incredible resource you have

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:47.580
in the professors here today,
which you really don't want to

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.100
take for granted.

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:51.120
Learning a little bit about
yourself -- and I know that

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.760
sounds touchy-feely, but
I'll give a couple

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.320
specifics around that.

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.970
And then, of course, there's no
substitute for trying this

00:46:57.970 --> 00:47:00.260
hands-on to see whether
it suits you.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:03.680
So, this is pretty much exactly
as I remember John

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:04.570
Geanakoplos --

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:11.210
genius mad scientist. You can
find him on Open Yale now, and

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:13.600
if you have not yet taken his
class, and it's offered next

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:17.480
year, I would strongly recommend
that you do so.

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.520
David Swensen, I understand
you've had the distinct

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:22.850
pleasure of hearing from
already, the most successful

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:25.630
endowment manager ever, the
reason that we get to have

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:27.630
nice things here at Yale.

00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:30.420
And I just keep coming back time
and again to Pioneering

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:34.480
Portfolio Management, the
bedrock of core investing

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.230
principles that he articulates
in that book.

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:39.530
Even if you never become an
institutional investor and are

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:42.790
only thinking as a retail
investor, it's still

00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:44.330
incredibly useful stuff.

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:47.100
And he does teach a
senior seminar.

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.520
And then, in addition to this
class, as you probably know,

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.130
Professor Shiller has a graduate
seminar, which I

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:54.430
think you have promised
to let students apply

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:55.435
to, to get into to.

00:47:55.435 --> 00:47:56.676
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
Yes, I had

00:47:56.676 --> 00:47:57.750
about eight last semester.

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:59.250
JON FOUGNER: OK.

00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:01.350
And how did they do?

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:03.070
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: That's
an embarrassing thing.

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:06.930
They did pretty well, against
our graduate students.

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:09.520
I won't rank them.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.422
Embarrassing to our
graduate students.

00:48:12.422 --> 00:48:16.340
JON FOUGNER: But flattering
to all of you.

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:18.750
As Professor Shiller mentioned,
I got to work a

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:20.300
little bit on The New Financial
Order as an

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:24.930
undergraduate, and I just
still consider it such a

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:29.110
rewarding experience, because
the tenets that you talk about

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:31.920
in this book, around how finance
can be a technology

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:34.890
for societal innovation,
everything from the micro

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:37.580
level of personal income
insurance to encouraging

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:40.600
people to take more risks early
on in their careers, to

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.670
the macro level of GDP insurance
are some really

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:45.420
visionary ideas.

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:47.930
I, of course, remain dismayed
that some of them have not

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:50.080
been put into practice yet,
but that really is an

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:53.118
opportunity for all of you who
are interested in Finance for

00:48:53.118 --> 00:48:58.270
Idealists to think about that as
a potential career option.

00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:00.720
Other useful courses, of course,
anything with math,

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.820
probabilities, stats,
econometrics, Excel modeling,

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.970
especially using the three
financial statements, computer

00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:09.550
science, computer programming
is going to serve you well,

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:11.650
not just in investment banking,
which we're talking

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:14.120
about this morning, but also
in those other aspects of

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:17.900
financial services
like trading.

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:19.640
Now, kind of switching
gears a little bit.

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.355
How many you have either
done Myers-Briggs

00:49:21.355 --> 00:49:24.250
or Strengths Finder?

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:25.370
A few.

00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:28.910
Maybe 20 -- maybe 30% or so.

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:32.510
So, these are tools that I think
have become a little bit

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:36.000
more popular in recent years,
which are basically

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.980
psychological inventories
where you spend an hour

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:42.140
answering multiple choice
questions, then they literally

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:45.730
spit out a profile of how
you like to work.

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:47.760
Obviously, there's no right or
wrong answers, they're really

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:49.160
just preferences.

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:52.030
It's a pretty modest investment
of your time --

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:53.470
maybe an hour each --

00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:56.380
to gain insight not just into
what you're good at, but also

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:59.570
to helping you articulate to
potential employers really

00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:02.100
what you can bring
to the table.

00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:04.270
And then, of course, where the
rubber meets the road, is

00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:06.580
actually applying for that
internship or that job, and

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.710
getting your foot in the door.

00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:11.720
Career Services on campus are
a fabulous resource, but

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.510
because of that they are very
scarce resource, because

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:16.970
almost everyone is using them.

00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:20.250
So, if you want to find jobs
that don't get 200 other Yale

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:22.590
resumes coming in their front
door, you want to look a

00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:24.070
little further afield.

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:27.740
So, you've got things like lists
of investment management

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:30.870
firms, from Institutional
Investors, American Banker,

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:31.780
Hedge Fund Research.

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:33.320
There are plenty
of these lists.

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.750
And I'd say, don't be shy
about cold calling, cold

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:37.400
emailing --

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.560
just kind of be persistent.

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.520
We touched on professors here.

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:45.180
I am incredibly grateful to
Professor Shiller, Ray Fair,

00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:48.430
David Swensen, folks who have
helped me in my career, even

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:51.710
at this extremely early stage
in my career, and it was

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:53.600
really just because I asked.

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.870
And I would encourage you to
do the same thing, because

00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:57.920
once you've left campus,
it gets a lot

00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:00.150
harder to get that help.

00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:02.140
And then the alumni
directory --

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:04.840
how many folks have been using
the alumni directory to reach

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:05.760
out for jobs?

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:09.800
Maybe 15%.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.530
I'd encourage you to do so, and
all I would add to that

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:15.300
is, think about what you share
in common with the people

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.390
you're reaching out to, think
about whether you can

00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:19.870
reciprocate the help that you're
asking for, even if

00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:22.750
that might not be obvious now,
because they're established in

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:24.570
their career and you're
just starting out.

00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:26.920
I had a student in this class
reach out to me three weeks

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:29.920
ago interested in advice, and
I was happy to share that.

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.520
And actually, he ended up being
really helpful, helping

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.310
me understand in where you all
are in your decision making

00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:37.200
process and your career
right now.

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.850
So, there are always ways that
you can help, and you'll find

00:51:39.850 --> 00:51:44.650
a much more welcome hand if
you're about to do that.

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:46.480
And then lastly, recruiters.

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:48.980
These large, so-called ''two
and 20'' funds, the

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:52.030
alternative asset managers,
typically use third party

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:55.740
recruiters to find the talent
that they want to interview.

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:59.370
And they are typically targeting
current banking

00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:02.160
analysts and associates, but
there's nothing to say that,

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:05.620
if you have a strong finance and
technical background as an

00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:08.380
undergraduate, that you couldn't
actually get on their

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:11.740
radar and try to use them
for a placement.

00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:15.020
The only caveat I would add to
that is, that you want to be

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.740
really clear and confident when
you speak to them about

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:19.770
what is that you're
looking for.

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:22.190
Because if you go in there
waffling, asking them to sort

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:25.470
of be your mentor and your
career coach, they're really

00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:28.310
not going to get that sense
of confidence for you, and

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:30.860
they're not going to want to
put you in front of one of

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:34.360
their clients, who are the
asset management firms.

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:35.240
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
We're having

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:35.920
questions in just a minute.

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:36.450
JON FOUGNER: Oh, great.

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:37.374
Yes.

00:52:37.374 --> 00:52:40.146
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:52:40.146 --> 00:52:40.970
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: We're
going to open it up for

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:43.580
questions in a minute, but
go ahead and interpose.

00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:44.470
STUDENT: It could probably also
come at the end, I was

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:46.760
just wondering, who
is Keith Ferrazzi?

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.240
JON FOUGNER: How many folks
are familiar with Keith

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.130
Ferrazzi in the room?

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:52.430
Some people are -- their
arms are getting tired.

00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:54.200
Maybe 20%.

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:59.570
So, Keith was the youngest
ever Fortune 500 CMO.

00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:03.590
And he's a fellow Yalie, New
York Times best-selling

00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:06.310
author, written a lot about the
role that relationships

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:07.470
play in business.

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:10.370
And you hear this word
networking, which, I think,

00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:13.400
all of us now get sort of a sort
of unctuous feel around.

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:16.570
It seems very, sort of,
superficial and self-serving,

00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:19.950
and what he's really helped
elucidate is, how the basic

00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:21.700
tenets of psychology --

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.660
and in this respect, he reminds
me of Professor

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:27.090
Shiller -- applying the basic
tenets of psychology to how

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:28.790
you actually build real,
meaningful business

00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:31.030
relationships, and breaking down
this artificial barrier

00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:34.850
between relationships
and business.

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:36.390
Because business is
relationships.

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:38.990
As Professor Shiller mentioned,
one of the things

00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:41.650
that investment bankers try to
do is, establish senior level

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:44.650
relationships, because it's
ultimately individuals, not

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:46.082
entire companies, who are
making decisions.

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:54.740
So, just to share a couple of
anecdotes about my transition

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:57.460
from banking, after banking, as
I said, I knew I wanted to

00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:02.180
work in tech, and I very
fortuitously got a phone call

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:05.130
from a lifelong friend of mine
around that time, who was an

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:07.250
engineer who had started
working at Facebook.

00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:10.730
And what he convinced me was,
that I could help him and his

00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:13.550
colleagues change how
people communicate.

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:19.190
I was pretty sort of anxious
about this, pretty intimidated

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:22.850
by the prospect of being
a business guy doing

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:24.480
engineering.

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:27.000
And what he told me, and I
ultimately think this proved

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.890
true, is that you don't have to
be an engineer in Silicon

00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:33.040
Valley to have an impact, you
just have to be able to think

00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:35.400
rigorously like an
engineer does.

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:37.500
I think the training, that
you're doing here at Yale, and

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:40.430
then the potential training at
investment banking, both have

00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:43.000
the potential to serve you
well in that respect.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.900
So, what we're trying to do at
Facebook is get people the

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:47.790
power to share and make the
world more open and connected.

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:49.840
Pretty simple, in principle.

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:52.680
And our strategy for doing this
is mapping out what we

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.820
call the social graph.

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:54.930
Now, we didn't create this.

00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:58.200
This exists out in the world,
all we're trying to do is draw

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:01.355
a mathematical representation
of it, and that's basically

00:55:01.355 --> 00:55:05.540
who likes whom, and
who likes what?

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:07.970
And then, we push information
as efficiently as possible

00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:10.790
along the edges of
that ground.

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:15.480
So, this is kind of where I
spend most of my day, not just

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:21.380
over here in FarmVille, but also
over here in ads-land.

00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:26.320
And what my role is called is
''local inbound product

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:29.320
marketing.'' So, to kind of
parse that out, what we mean

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:32.340
is basically, I go and talk to
local businesses, restaurants,

00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:37.380
plumbers, understand what their
pain points are, what

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:39.750
other advertising products they
use, what they're trying

00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:42.740
to accomplish as a local
business owner, and then

00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:45.920
basically synthesize that with
data analysis, and ultimately

00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:49.530
present it to the engineers as
a case for what we should

00:55:49.530 --> 00:55:50.060
build next.

00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:52.720
So, these are questions like,
what do the ads that you see

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:54.040
on Facebook look like?

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:56.440
How should they interact with
the rest of the product?

00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:59.830
How can we target them to
make them more relevant?

00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:01.220
A whole bunch more.

00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:05.280
The real guiding precept here
is that, it's basically what

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.800
Henry Ford said, right?

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:09.080
He didn't want to build the
faster horse, even if that's

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:11.240
what his clients might have
asked for, he wanted to build

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.540
something that was dramatically
more useful, and

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.930
for him that was a car, and for
us it's something that we

00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:17.740
call social advertising.

00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:19.620
I am happy to chat a little
bit more about that during

00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:22.840
questions, if folks
are interested.

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:25.880
So finally, just to kind of
compare these two roles, and

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:28.030
how one might have prepared me
for the other, I think the

00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:30.860
three things from banking that
have served me best working on

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:35.030
internet products are: One, this
cross function of process

00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:37.490
management, which is a
ubiquitous part of the

00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:38.670
business world.

00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:42.215
Two, building polished
presentations, this one

00:56:42.215 --> 00:56:43.680
notwithstanding.

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:47.360
And three, being resourceful
about tracking down data

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:49.920
points to help make the
right decisions.

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:51.440
On the other hand, there's some
parts of the job that

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.650
were totally new.

00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:55.360
Thinking from the mindset of the
CMO, the chief marketing

00:56:55.360 --> 00:57:00.070
officer, rather than the CFO,
the chief financial officer,

00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:02.340
just the pace of the
environment, banking is

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:05.780
fast-paced, but the rate at
which products evolve in the

00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:08.640
internet is dramatically
faster.

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:12.010
And the fundamental job itself,
which is basically

00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:14.550
creating new products, building
the business case for

00:57:14.550 --> 00:57:17.740
them, validating that case with
data, trying to actually

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:19.525
mock them up -- and I assure
you, I'm not good

00:57:19.525 --> 00:57:20.980
in Photoshop --

00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:24.110
and then actually use those
mocks and that case to inspire

00:57:24.110 --> 00:57:28.930
engineers and product managers
to want to build them.

00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:31.430
So, it's an environment that
is much more ambiguous.

00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:34.200
The yardsticks for whether or
not you're going in the right

00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:37.000
direction, especially in
the short term, are

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.340
not nearly as clear.

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.120
But if that's actually something
that's appealing to

00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:44.970
you, then I strongly encourage
you to check out jobs around

00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:46.630
Silicon Valley, and especially
at Facebook.

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:49.930
So, you can actually go to
facebook.com/careers --

00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:51.285
quick plug --

00:57:51.285 --> 00:57:53.680
to check out about the
internships and the full time

00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:55.770
jobs that we have available.

00:57:55.770 --> 00:57:57.656
So, Professor Shiller, did you
want to use the rest of the

00:57:57.656 --> 00:57:58.250
time for questions.

00:57:58.250 --> 00:58:00.330
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
Well, yes.

00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:02.495
I'm opening it up to all
of you for questions.

00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:10.350
OK, you have a question
back there.

00:58:18.726 --> 00:58:21.360
STUDENT: Before you did your
junior summer in investment

00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:24.216
banking, how did you even
know you wanted to --

00:58:24.216 --> 00:58:26.835
JON FOUGNER: I caught some of
that, and then the screen

00:58:26.835 --> 00:58:29.220
caught some of it, so just bear
with us for one second,

00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:32.280
and then I'll be
right with you.

00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:35.560
You said, before I did my junior
summer, what did I do?

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:37.280
STUDENT: Before you did
your junior summer.

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:39.329
Or how did you figure out that
investment banking was the

00:58:39.329 --> 00:58:42.032
field you wanted to be in?

00:58:42.032 --> 00:58:45.240
JON FOUGNER: Well, you know, I
knew that some of the stuff on

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:49.710
the right hand column of the
ROI chart was stuff I was

00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:50.380
interested in.

00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:53.670
I was interested in the
technical side of the work,

00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:58.470
working on math, basically,
but also interested in the

00:58:58.470 --> 00:59:01.790
relationship side of it, the
strategic side, thinking about

00:59:01.790 --> 00:59:04.050
basically how you help
these companies

00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:06.990
vet the company decisions.

00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:10.400
And during the first week of
training, one of the partners

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.630
of the firm came in --

00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:14.035
and we use this term partner
kind of as a term of art,

00:59:14.035 --> 00:59:16.020
because, as the professor
mentioned, it's no longer a

00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:17.650
partnership --

00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:20.190
but he came in and said, when
our clients want to do really

00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:23.450
important things,
they come to us.

00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:25.360
And when they want to think
about important things, they

00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:27.485
come to fill-in-the-blank
name of top

00:59:27.485 --> 00:59:29.680
tier consulting company.

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:33.680
And that kind of action, and
actually physically seeing the

00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:35.740
results that you create in
the world was really

00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:37.070
appealing to me.

00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:39.600
And I hadn't done Strengths
Finder yet at the time, but I

00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:42.220
did it subsequently, and found,
not surprisingly, that

00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:46.470
that's where my psychological
reward structure was kind of

00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:47.720
geared towards.

00:59:49.786 --> 00:59:51.036
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: Yes?

00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:56.710
STUDENT: So, Peter Thiel, who
was the first investor in

00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:59.670
Facebook, and is currently on
their board, is now offering

00:59:59.670 --> 01:00:04.170
20 people under the age of 20
each $100,000 to drop out of

01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:06.330
school for two years and start
their own companies.

01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:08.150
And since you actually work for
Facebook, I was wondering

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:09.840
what you thought of that.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.390
JON FOUGNER: Yes, I think
that's fascinating.

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:17.090
And obviously, I don't work
with Peter Thiel.

01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:19.070
Look, I think, whatever
we can do to promote

01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:21.720
innovation is great.

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:23.740
Now, if you're sitting here in
this room and you're saying,

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:27.380
well, do I want to take this
risk of sacrificing this

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:30.330
signaling device of this college
degree, and also

01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:32.670
potentially sacrificing some
structured classroom

01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:36.700
experience, in order to rapidly
accelerate, how

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:37.520
quickly I got into

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.420
entrepreneurship, I don't know.

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:42.990
That's a personal decision that
is for you to make, and I

01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:44.460
don't really have any
opinion on it.

01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:47.100
Ultimately, for me it'll come
down to, do these companies

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.410
actually end up doing really
cool things and building

01:00:49.410 --> 01:00:50.910
really cool stuff?

01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:54.580
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: And
I'd add, it isn't as risky as

01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:57.456
you might think, because Yale
will take you back, if it

01:00:57.456 --> 01:01:01.100
fails in a couple of years.

01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:05.090
JON FOUGNER: One of our very
early employees was a Yalie,

01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:07.630
who had had an undergraduate
experience somewhat like

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:09.500
you're describing, where, I
think, he had actually taken

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.900
some time off to work
on startups.

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:15.460
I think he came back, finished
his degree, and is now a

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:17.575
partner at Benchmark, one
of the firms that

01:01:17.575 --> 01:01:18.825
I had on that slide.

01:01:23.422 --> 01:01:24.790
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: Well,
while they're thinking,

01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:26.220
can I ask you --

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:31.710
I emphasized the core values
at Goldman Sachs, and it

01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:36.580
strikes me that Facebook
is totally different.

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:38.610
Maybe I'm wrong.

01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:42.950
Can you tell me, what are the
core values at Facebook?

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:44.440
If I were to read that list
that I just gave you from

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:48.835
Goldman Sachs, how would it
sound to the Facebook people?

01:01:48.835 --> 01:01:50.960
JON FOUGNER: Yes, so I think
there are similarities and

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.570
differences.

01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:57.430
I think, each of us has a core
constituency, who we wake up

01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:59.760
thinking about them, go to bed
thinking about them, probably

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.440
dream about them, and know that
whether or not we serve

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:05.340
that constituency will determine
the success or

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:06.960
failure of the company.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:11.040
And at Goldman that
was the clients.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:15.430
And at Facebook, our number one
focus is the users and the

01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:16.580
user experience.

01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:18.650
And we care a lot about our
partners, we care a lot about

01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:20.460
our advertisers, we care a
lot about everyone in the

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:23.010
ecosystem, but ultimately
we know we have to

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:24.750
serve the user as well.

01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:28.850
So, each company, I think, has
almost a maniacal focus on

01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:32.650
serving one core constituency,
albeit they're different.

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:34.640
Now, in terms of the day-to-day
experience, I do

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.860
think they're quite different.

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:39.030
I think that what
I'm doing now is

01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:40.875
quite a bit more creative.

01:02:40.875 --> 01:02:43.250
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: You're
not doing spreadsheets.

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:44.725
JON FOUGNER: A little
bit, but --

01:02:44.725 --> 01:02:45.116
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
You're doing it, still.

01:02:45.116 --> 01:02:46.970
JON FOUGNER: Yes, not as much.

01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:49.910
And I really love the creative
side of the work.

01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:55.660
If you think back to Steven
Schwarzman's lecture, where he

01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:58.430
mentions that there's no
flexibility for getting the

01:02:58.430 --> 01:03:01.190
numbers wrong, I mean certainly
we feel the same

01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:04.510
way, all the analysis needs to
be correct, but there's almost

01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:09.410
an ominous tone, when he says
that, whereas the way that we

01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:12.910
operate is knowing that we have
to move really fast in

01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:16.340
order to continue to innovate,
continue to stay relevant.

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:19.330
And so, that means that
sometimes you make mistakes,

01:03:19.330 --> 01:03:21.650
and it's no secret that we've
made mistakes, and some of

01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:23.870
them have been big mistakes.

01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:27.650
And we just try to minimize
the number of times that

01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:31.270
happens, try to fix them as soon
as they do happen, and

01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:34.626
just be honest about them, and
admit them when we make them.

01:03:34.626 --> 01:03:36.670
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: Can I
ask a question of the class?

01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:39.040
You set the example.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.740
How many in this class are
engineering majors?

01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:45.470
Not many.

01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:47.330
Like 5% maybe.

01:03:47.330 --> 01:03:50.820
What about science majors?

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:56.530
That looks like 10%.

01:03:56.530 --> 01:03:58.760
See, you're kind of in an
engineering company, right?

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:03.930
I mean, I don't know exactly
what Facebook is, but is there

01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:05.580
some kind of division here?

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.954
Why aren't there more engineers
in this class?

01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:14.214
JON FOUGNER: That sounds like
a question for the class.

01:04:14.214 --> 01:04:15.299
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
Well, I can't ask them,

01:04:15.299 --> 01:04:15.950
because they're not here.

01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:16.770
JON FOUGNER: All the engineers,
who are not in the

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:18.320
room, why are you
not in the room?

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.970
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: But
I mean, is there a big

01:04:21.970 --> 01:04:22.870
cultural difference?

01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:24.530
I mean, are engineers
prejudiced

01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:26.490
against us finance people?

01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:28.392
You're there, so --

01:04:28.392 --> 01:04:30.700
JON FOUGNER: Look, I think
that product design and

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.840
software engineering is at the
heart of the company, but as I

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:34.720
mentioned, I was pretty
intimidated going in and

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:39.520
saying, huh, I'm going to
be a business guy here.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.910
Am I not really going to be
able to have an impact?

01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:43.670
And I think the things that are
important for the business

01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:47.680
people are: One, to remember
what the core mission of the

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:52.850
company is, which for us is
really all about the users.

01:04:52.850 --> 01:04:56.000
Two, to have a sense of
what is feasible.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.430
So, you don't actually have to
know how to write the code, or

01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:02.060
even necessarily how to mock up
the product, but if you're

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:04.130
making recommendations that we
should build things that are

01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:08.220
simply technologically not
feasible, you're going to

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:10.950
waste people's time and lose
credibility pretty quickly.

01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:13.970
And then, three, I think, when
you do the analysis, engineers

01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:18.100
are going to want to see as
rigorous analysis as possible,

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.270
quantitative analysis when
that's relevant, when that's

01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:23.210
possible, and to the extent that
you can bring that to the

01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:24.930
table, I think that's helpful.

01:05:24.930 --> 01:05:27.700
If you think about the business
world at large, one

01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:29.740
of the things, that's just
going to be increasingly

01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:34.340
important, is the ability to
design, conduct, and interpret

01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:37.320
statistically significant,
valid experiments.

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.720
And this sounds like a pretty
straightforward thing, that

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.250
you might learn by maybe
second or third year of

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:44.610
college, and yet you get out
into the business world, and

01:05:44.610 --> 01:05:46.690
you'll find that many of your
colleagues, whether they're

01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:49.940
coming from MBAs or other
backgrounds, may not actually

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:51.070
have that background.

01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:53.700
So, being able to bring that
sort of rigor to the table,

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:57.590
whether it's at a consumer
internet company or an

01:05:57.590 --> 01:06:01.662
industrial company, anything
else, I think is very helpful.

01:06:01.662 --> 01:06:02.980
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: You
know, I'm thinking, maybe I

01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:05.970
should change the name of
this course to Financial

01:06:05.970 --> 01:06:06.916
Engineering.

01:06:06.916 --> 01:06:09.240
That would bring
in the others.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:14.360
Because to me, engineering and
finance have a certain

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:14.840
connection.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.630
They're both designing
devices.

01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:19.820
I think, we have another
question.

01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:22.340
STUDENT: Have you thought of
going back to graduate school,

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:25.210
and how do you see that playing
into a career like

01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:27.490
investment banking?

01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:29.110
JON FOUGNER: Yes, I have thought
about going back to

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:29.660
graduate school.

01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:32.980
I think that all of us want
to be lifelong learners

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.890
throughout our career.

01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:36.990
There's a number of ways
you can do that.

01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:38.930
Graduate school is
one of them.

01:06:38.930 --> 01:06:41.560
Another is, going into
industries where you're just

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:44.245
confident that everyone you're
working with is really smart,

01:06:44.245 --> 01:06:47.910
and they're going to push you
hard, and not settle for

01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:51.120
mediocrity, so you just know
you're going to learn by that

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:53.020
pressure and that osmosis.

01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.570
And then, I think, there's
some kind of simple,

01:06:54.570 --> 01:06:57.090
structured things that
you can do, as well.

01:06:57.090 --> 01:07:00.770
I threw a slide up of a couple
that you can do in the comfort

01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:02.180
of your own living room
-- the Meyers-Briggs

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:03.830
and Strengths Finder.

01:07:03.830 --> 01:07:08.810
But then also, you can leverage
having a workplace to

01:07:08.810 --> 01:07:10.690
do things like peer
coaching, career

01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:13.330
coaching, executive coaching.

01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:18.530
So, I kind of take a somewhat
agnostic point of view as to

01:07:18.530 --> 01:07:21.240
which of these tools I'm going
to use at any given time.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:24.210
I just know, that I constantly
want to be challenging myself

01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:27.754
and constantly want to
be learning more.

01:07:27.754 --> 01:07:29.004
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: OK.

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.350
STUDENT: I've heard a lot
about issues with

01:07:32.350 --> 01:07:35.520
click-through rates on various
social networking sites, so if

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:38.160
you could talk about, what you
think the putative value of

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.940
Facebook should be, and whether
the current valuation

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:42.330
is appropriate.

01:07:42.330 --> 01:07:44.030
JON FOUGNER: Yes, so, I'm happy
to share a little bit

01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:45.420
about click-through rates.

01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:50.170
I'll probably defer on the
question of how much the

01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:51.420
company should be valued at.

01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:59.300
Is everyone familiar with what
a click-through rate is?

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:00.140
No, not everyone.

01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:00.990
OK.

01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:04.810
So, this is just
a simple ratio.

01:08:04.810 --> 01:08:08.270
Let's say, you show an ad some
number of times to users on

01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:09.630
the internet.

01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:13.479
It's the ratio of the number
of times the user clicks on

01:08:13.479 --> 01:08:16.550
that ad to the total number
of times you showed it.

01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:20.060
So, if you show an ad 100 times,
and you get one click,

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:22.640
you have a 1% click-through
rate.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:28.310
And if you think about, well,
why are people advertising?

01:08:28.310 --> 01:08:30.970
In marketing there's kind of
this concept of this marketing

01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:34.459
funnel, which is a little bit
silly, but it actually conveys

01:08:34.459 --> 01:08:36.140
a useful concept.

01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:39.279
Up here is everyone in the
world, and then here is the

01:08:39.279 --> 01:08:41.180
people we can actually make
aware of our product.

01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:44.394
And then here is the people who
we can actually make have

01:08:44.394 --> 01:08:46.040
an affinity for our product.

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:49.370
And here is the people who we
can actually make consider

01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:50.630
purchasing our product.

01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:53.460
And then people who actually buy
it, and then repeat, loyal

01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:54.550
customers who buy it
more and more.

01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:56.859
So, we get to a narrower
and narrower pool.

01:08:56.859 --> 01:08:59.200
And what marketers are
constantly trying to do is,

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.330
push people through this funnel,
so they can actually

01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:04.380
start with someone, who may not
know about the product at

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:05.460
all, and then actually
get them to buy

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:07.660
it again and again.

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:09.760
So, marketers use a variety
of different tools.

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:13.100
Online advertising is one, but
that represents maybe 15% of

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:15.250
the market, but it's a
relatively new one, and

01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:18.180
there's plenty of others that go
back decades or centuries.

01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:22.350
Things like television,
radio, print.

01:09:22.350 --> 01:09:24.720
These different media play
different roles in getting

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.040
people through this
marketing funnel.

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:30.600
And if you think about, where
online advertising originally

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.380
grew up, it was really
towards the very

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:34.120
bottom of this funnel.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:39.149
Of, OK, I am looking for a blue
iPod at the best price,

01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:41.710
that I can either order online
or that it's within five miles

01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:42.180
of my home.

01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:45.220
So, I search that on a search
engine, I see a list of

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:48.440
vendors, and in that case, it's
really important whether

01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:50.960
I click through, because
that's basically the

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.260
determinant of whether or not
we get them through the next

01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:55.340
stage in the marketing funnel.

01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:57.970
If you think about Facebook
advertising, that is one of

01:09:57.970 --> 01:10:01.140
the roles that it can play, but
it can also actually play

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:03.740
throughout this entire marketing
funnel, where we

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:05.960
have a reach of 500 million
people, and then you can

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:07.660
target within that.

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:09.860
And then you can use things like
social context, telling

01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:12.680
you that your friend might
really love a product, to help

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:16.050
build your affinity for it, on
through this whole funnel.

01:10:16.050 --> 01:10:17.360
So, for some of it,
click-through rate is

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.480
relevant, for other of it,
click-through rate really

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:22.020
isn't relevant, and you need to
think about other sorts of

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:22.570
measurement.

01:10:22.570 --> 01:10:24.860
Things like companies
like Nielsen do.

01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:28.690
Like polling people and asking
them, OK, you saw this media,

01:10:28.690 --> 01:10:30.050
did it increase your

01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:31.420
likelihood to buy this product?

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:34.240
Or did it make you aware of the
message, that the brand is

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.570
trying to convey, that you
weren't aware of before?

01:10:36.570 --> 01:10:39.300
I think, it's one of a number
of metrics that go into

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:41.840
assessing the health of the
business as a whole.

PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: I
think we're essentially out of

01:10:43.930 --> 01:10:47.650
time, but let me just say,
click-through rates and

01:10:47.650 --> 01:10:52.260
marketing sound profit-oriented,
but it seems

01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:54.750
to me they have a social
purpose --

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:57.790
one thing is that capitalism is
being transformed by this

01:10:57.790 --> 01:11:01.100
kind of thing, because it gets
people to buy things that they

01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:01.510
really need.

01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:06.370
It's like your Strengths
Finder or Needs Finder.

01:11:06.370 --> 01:11:09.550
And I have to applaud Facebook
and other companies.

01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:13.860
Finally, I'm going to invite you
back in another 10 years.

01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:15.495
This was great.

01:11:15.495 --> 01:11:17.060
JON FOUGNER: Thanks.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.488
Professor Paul Bloom:
This class today is about

00:00:16.488 --> 00:00:18.785
language.
And language is,

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:23.050
to a large extent,
where the action is.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.494
The study of human language has
been the battleground over

00:00:26.494 --> 00:00:28.730
different theories of human
nature.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.148
So, every philosopher or
psychologist or humanist or

00:00:32.148 --> 00:00:36.036
neuroscientist who has ever
thought about people has had to

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:40.460
make some claim about the nature
of language and how it works.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.785
I'm including here people like
Aristotle and Plato,

00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:45.980
Hume, Locke,
Freud and Skinner.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.686
I'm also including modern-day
approaches to computational

00:00:49.686 --> 00:00:53.261
theory, cognitive neuroscience,
evolutionary theory and

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:56.894
cultural psychology.
If you hope to make it with a

00:00:56.894 --> 00:01:00.066
theory of what people are and
how people work,

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:03.380
you have to explain and talk
about language.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.501
In fact, language is
sufficiently interesting that,

00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:10.060
unlike most other things I'll
talk about in this class,

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.209
there is an entire field
devoted to its study,

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:17.409
the field of linguistics that
is entirely devoted to studying

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.189
the nuances and structures of
different languages.

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.897
Now, I'll first,
before getting into details,

00:01:23.897 --> 00:01:27.867
make a definitional point.
When I'm talking about language

00:01:27.867 --> 00:01:32.072
I'm meaning systems like English
and Dutch and Warlpiri and

00:01:32.072 --> 00:01:36.640
Italian and Turkish and Urdu and
what we've seen and heard right

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.265
now in class in the
demonstration that preceded the

00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:44.694
formal lecture.
Now, you could use language in

00:01:44.694 --> 00:01:47.869
a different sense.
You could use the term

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.567
"language" to describe what dogs
do, or what chimpanzees do,

00:01:51.567 --> 00:01:53.924
or birds.
You could use language to

00:01:53.924 --> 00:01:56.490
describe music,
talk about the--a musical

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.424
language or art,
or any communicative system,

00:01:59.424 --> 00:02:02.239
and there's actually nothing
wrong with that.

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:05.121
There's no rule about how
you're supposed to use the word

00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:07.504
"language."
But the problem is if you use

00:02:07.504 --> 00:02:10.580
the word "language" impossibly,
incredibly broadly,

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.129
then from a scientific point of
view it becomes useless to ask

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.896
interesting questions about it.
If language can refer to just

00:02:17.896 --> 00:02:21.080
about everything from English to
traffic signals,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.715
then we're not going to be able
to find interesting

00:02:23.715 --> 00:02:26.139
generalizations or do good
science about it.

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.510
So, what I want to do is,
I want to discuss the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.718
scientific notion of language,
at first restricting myself to

00:02:32.718 --> 00:02:37.834
systems like English and Dutch
and American sign language and

00:02:37.834 --> 00:02:40.794
Navajo and so on.
Once we've made some

00:02:40.794 --> 00:02:43.992
generalizations about language
in this narrow sense,

00:02:43.992 --> 00:02:46.534
we could then ask,
and we will ask,

00:02:46.534 --> 00:02:51.049
to what extent do other systems
such as animal communication

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.569
systems relate to this narrower
definition.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.509
So we could ask,
in this narrow sense,

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.550
what properties do languages
have and then go on to ask,

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.891
in a broader sense,
what other communicative

00:03:01.891 --> 00:03:04.069
systems also possess those
properties.

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.819
Well, some things are obvious
about language so here are some;

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.250
here are the questions we will
ask.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.159
This will frame our discussion
today.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.750
We'll first go over some basic
facts about language.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.890
We'll talk about what languages
share, we'll talk about how

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.435
language develops,
and we'll talk about language

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:25.639
and communication in nonhumans.
I began this class with a

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:30.442
demonstration of--that
illustrates two very important

00:03:30.442 --> 00:03:35.834
facts about language.
One is that languages all share

00:03:35.834 --> 00:03:39.520
some deep and intricate
universals.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.319
In particular,
all languages,

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.110
at minimum, are powerful enough
to convey an abstract notion

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.992
like this;
abstract in the sense that it

00:03:47.992 --> 00:03:51.821
talks about thoughts and it
talks about a proposition and

00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:55.754
spatial relations in objects.
There's no language in the

00:03:55.754 --> 00:03:59.780
world that you just cannot talk
about abstract things with.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.921
Every language can do this.
But the demonstration also

00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:06.381
illustrated another fact about
language, which is how different

00:04:06.381 --> 00:04:08.560
languages are.
They sound different.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.829
If you know one language,
you don't necessarily know

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.569
another.
It's not merely that you can't

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.762
understand it.
It could sound strange or look

00:04:17.762 --> 00:04:20.620
unusual in the case of a sign
language.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.548
And so, any adequate theory of
language has to allow for both

00:04:25.548 --> 00:04:30.230
the commonalities and the
differences across languages.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.937
And this is the puzzle faced by
the psychology and cognitive

00:04:33.937 --> 00:04:37.082
science of language.
Well, let's start with an

00:04:37.082 --> 00:04:41.100
interesting claim about language
made by Charles Darwin.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.970
So, Darwin writes,
"Man has an instinctive

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.329
tendency to speak,
as we see in the babble of our

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:50.277
young children,
while no child has an

00:04:50.277 --> 00:04:53.819
instinctive tendency to bake,
brew or write."

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:57.014
And what Darwin is claiming
here, and it's a controversial

00:04:57.014 --> 00:05:00.742
and interesting claim,
is that language is special in

00:05:00.742 --> 00:05:04.714
that there's some sort of
propensity or capacity or

00:05:04.714 --> 00:05:09.480
instinct for language unlike the
other examples he gives.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.132
Not everything comes natural to
us but Darwin suggests that

00:05:13.132 --> 00:05:15.645
language does.
Well, why should we believe

00:05:15.645 --> 00:05:18.695
this?
Well, there are some basic

00:05:18.695 --> 00:05:22.350
facts that support Darwin's
claim.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.778
For one thing,
every normal--every human

00:05:25.778 --> 00:05:29.591
society has language.
In the course of traveling,

00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:32.711
cultures encounter other
cultures and they often

00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:36.759
encounter cultures that are very
different from their own.

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:39.830
But through the course of human
history, nobody has ever

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.844
encountered another group of
humans that did not have a

00:05:42.844 --> 00:05:45.678
language.
Does this show that it's built

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:48.300
in?
Well, not necessarily.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.110
It could be a cultural
innovation.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.853
It could be,
for instance,

00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:56.828
that language is such a good
idea that every culture comes

00:05:56.828 --> 00:06:01.010
across it and develops it.
Just about every culture uses

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.191
some sort of utensils to eat
food with, a knife and a fork,

00:06:05.191 --> 00:06:09.163
chopsticks, a spoon.
This probably is not because

00:06:09.163 --> 00:06:13.459
use of eating utensils is human
nature, but rather,

00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:16.932
it's because it's just a very
useful thing that cultures

00:06:16.932 --> 00:06:20.563
discover over and over again.
Well, we know that this

00:06:20.563 --> 00:06:23.910
probably is not true with regard
to language.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.973
And one reason we know this is
because of the demonstrated case

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:34.863
studies where a language is
created within a single

00:06:34.863 --> 00:06:38.889
generation.
And these case studies have

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:43.846
happened over history.
The standard example is people

00:06:43.846 --> 00:06:48.071
involved in the slave trade.
The slave trade revolving

00:06:48.071 --> 00:06:51.524
around tobacco or cotton or
coffee or sugar would tend to

00:06:51.524 --> 00:06:55.410
mix slaves and laborers from
different language backgrounds,

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.182
in part deliberately,
so as to avoid the possibility

00:06:59.182 --> 00:07:01.462
of revolt.
What would happen is these

00:07:01.462 --> 00:07:04.730
people who were enslaved from
different cultures would develop

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.783
a makeshift communication system
so they could talk to one

00:07:07.783 --> 00:07:11.219
another.
And this is called a "pidgin,"

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:15.468
p-i-d-g-i-n, a pidgin.
And this pidgin was how they

00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:17.961
would talk.
And this pidgin was not a

00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:19.854
language.
It was strings of words

00:07:19.854 --> 00:07:22.931
borrowed from the different
languages around them and put

00:07:22.931 --> 00:07:25.019
together in sort of haphazard
ways.

00:07:25.019 --> 00:07:29.233
The question is what happens to
the children who are raised in

00:07:29.233 --> 00:07:32.432
this society.
And you might expect it that

00:07:32.432 --> 00:07:36.370
they would come to speak a
pidgin, but they don't.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.131
What happens is,
in the course of a single

00:07:39.131 --> 00:07:42.230
generation, they develop their
own language.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.096
They create a language with
rich syntax and morphology and

00:07:46.096 --> 00:07:50.029
phonology, terms that we'll
understand in a few minutes.

00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:54.740
And this language that they
create is called a "creole."

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.026
And languages that we know now
as creoles, the word refers back

00:07:59.026 --> 00:08:01.998
to their history.
That means that they were

00:08:01.998 --> 00:08:05.441
developed from pidgins.
And this is interesting because

00:08:05.441 --> 00:08:08.725
this suggests that to some
extent the ability to use and

00:08:08.725 --> 00:08:12.129
understand and learn language is
part of human nature.

00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:14.430
It doesn't require an extensive
cultural history.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:18.404
Rather, just about any normal
child, even when not exposed to

00:08:18.404 --> 00:08:21.649
a full-fledged language,
can create a language.

00:08:21.649 --> 00:08:25.130
And more recently,
there's been case studies of

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.930
children who acquire sign
language.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.995
There's a wonderful case in
Nicaragua in sign language where

00:08:31.995 --> 00:08:36.130
they acquire sign language from
adults who themselves are not

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.770
versed in sign language.
They're sort of second-language

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.638
learners struggling along.
What you might have expected

00:08:42.638 --> 00:08:45.788
would be the children would then
use whatever system their adults

00:08:45.788 --> 00:08:48.409
use, but they don't.
They "creolized" it.

00:08:48.409 --> 00:08:51.110
They take this makeshift
communication system developed

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:52.259
by adults and,
again,

00:08:52.259 --> 00:08:56.667
they turn it into a full-blown
language, suggesting that to

00:08:56.667 --> 00:09:00.466
some extent it's part of our
human nature to create

00:09:00.466 --> 00:09:06.046
languages.
Also, every normal human has

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:09.577
language.
Not everybody in this room can

00:09:09.577 --> 00:09:12.421
ride a bicycle.
Not everybody in this room can

00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:15.744
play chess.
But everybody possesses at

00:09:15.744 --> 00:09:19.173
least one language.
And everybody started to

00:09:19.173 --> 00:09:22.399
possess at least one language
when they were a child.

00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:26.241
There are exceptions,
but the exceptions come about

00:09:26.241 --> 00:09:28.929
due to some sort of brain
damage.

00:09:28.929 --> 00:09:33.900
Any neurologically normal human
will come to possess a language.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:38.677
What else do we know?
Well, the claim that language

00:09:38.677 --> 00:09:42.611
is part of human nature is
supported by neurological

00:09:42.611 --> 00:09:45.347
studies,
some of which were referred to

00:09:45.347 --> 00:09:49.061
in the chapters on the brain
that you read earlier that talk

00:09:49.061 --> 00:09:52.899
about dedicated parts of the
brain that work for language.

00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:56.399
And if parts of these
brains--if parts--if these parts

00:09:56.399 --> 00:10:00.427
of the brain are damaged you get
language deficits or aphasias

00:10:00.427 --> 00:10:04.059
where you might lose the ability
to understand or create

00:10:04.059 --> 00:10:06.701
language.
More speculatively,

00:10:06.701 --> 00:10:11.744
there has been some fairly
recent work studying the genetic

00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:16.022
basis of language,
looking at the genes that are

00:10:16.022 --> 00:10:20.505
directly responsible for the
capacity to learn and use

00:10:20.505 --> 00:10:23.376
language.
And one bit of evidence that

00:10:23.376 --> 00:10:27.154
these genes are implicated is
that some unfortunate people

00:10:27.154 --> 00:10:29.740
have point mutations in these
genes.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.250
And such people are unable to
learn and use language.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.761
So, in general,
there is some support,

00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:39.902
at least at a very broad level,
for the claim that language is

00:10:39.902 --> 00:10:42.549
in some sense part of human
nature.

00:10:42.549 --> 00:10:44.360
Well, what do we mean by
language?

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.559
What are we talking about when
we talk about language?

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:48.975
We don't want to restrict
ourselves, for instance,

00:10:48.975 --> 00:10:53.799
to English or French.
What do all languages share?

00:10:53.799 --> 00:11:00.539
Well, all languages are
creative and this means a couple

00:11:00.539 --> 00:11:04.507
of things.
One meaning is the meaning

00:11:04.507 --> 00:11:09.245
emphasized by Rene Descartes.
When Rene Descartes argued that

00:11:09.245 --> 00:11:12.238
we are more than merely
machines, his best piece of

00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:15.590
evidence for him was the human
capacity for language.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:19.015
No machine could do this
because our capacity for

00:11:19.015 --> 00:11:23.436
language is unbounded and free.
We could say anything we choose

00:11:23.436 --> 00:11:25.740
to say.
We have free will.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.317
And in fact,
language allows us to produce a

00:11:29.317 --> 00:11:33.104
virtual infinity of sentences.
So, we could create and

00:11:33.104 --> 00:11:35.500
understand sentences that we
never heard before.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.049
And there are a lot of
sentences.

00:11:38.049 --> 00:11:44.991
So, if you want to estimate how
many grammatical sentences under

00:11:44.991 --> 00:11:49.177
twenty words in English,
the answer is,

00:11:49.177 --> 00:11:53.279
"a lot."
And what this means is that any

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:58.209
theory of language use and
language comprehension cannot

00:11:58.209 --> 00:12:02.268
simply appeal to a list.
When you understand a sentence

00:12:02.268 --> 00:12:05.053
I said you have to have the
capacity to understand a

00:12:05.053 --> 00:12:07.730
sentence even if you've never
heard it before.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:11.684
And this is because we could
effortlessly produce and

00:12:11.684 --> 00:12:16.019
understand sentences that no
human has ever said before on

00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:18.785
earth.
Would anybody volunteer to say

00:12:18.785 --> 00:12:21.393
a sentence, non obscene,
non derogatory,

00:12:21.393 --> 00:12:24.201
that has never been spoken
before on earth,

00:12:24.201 --> 00:12:24.870
ever?

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:35.799
Here.
I'll start.

00:12:35.799 --> 00:12:39.751
"It's surprisingly easy to get
a purple tie on eBay if you

00:12:39.751 --> 00:12:43.467
don't care much about quality."
I could imagine no one else in

00:12:43.467 --> 00:12:47.361
the world has said this before.
"I am upset that one cannot

00:12:47.361 --> 00:12:52.629
easily download 'Buffy the
Vampire Slayer' through iTunes."

00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:56.931
Now, it's possible somebody
said both these sentences

00:12:56.931 --> 00:13:00.820
before, but you probably have
not heard them.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.480
But you understand them
immediately.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:08.551
So, how do you do it?
Well, you have rules in your

00:13:08.551 --> 00:13:11.424
head.
You've learnt what the words

00:13:11.424 --> 00:13:15.679
mean, but you have abstract and
unconscious rules that take

00:13:15.679 --> 00:13:18.242
these words,
figure out the order,

00:13:18.242 --> 00:13:22.350
and in a fraction of a second,
give rise to understanding.

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:24.649
And that's the sort of thing
linguists study.

00:13:24.649 --> 00:13:30.438
So, take some standard examples
from the linguistic study of

00:13:30.438 --> 00:13:32.976
English.
And bear in mind the rules

00:13:32.976 --> 00:13:36.570
we're talking about here are not
rules you explicitly know.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:40.422
They're automatic rules of the
same sort we're going to talk

00:13:40.422 --> 00:13:44.078
about in the context of visual
perception in that they're

00:13:44.078 --> 00:13:47.604
implicit and unconscious and not
accessible to explicit

00:13:47.604 --> 00:13:50.214
understanding.
So for instance,

00:13:50.214 --> 00:13:55.189
immediately you read "The pig
is eager to eat" versus "The pig

00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:59.512
is easy to eat" and in a
fraction of a second you know

00:13:59.512 --> 00:14:04.254
there's an important difference.
"The pig is eager to eat" means

00:14:04.254 --> 00:14:07.592
the state of affairs that we're
talking about is when the pig

00:14:07.592 --> 00:14:10.303
does the eating.
"The pig is easy to eat" is

00:14:10.303 --> 00:14:14.062
when the pig is being eaten.
You would see a sentence like

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:17.070
"Bill knew that John liked him"
and you know,

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.600
without even knowing how you
know,

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.557
that this could mean that Bill
knew that John liked Bill or it

00:14:24.557 --> 00:14:28.539
could mean that Bill knew that
John liked Fred.

00:14:28.539 --> 00:14:32.789
But it can't mean that Bill
knew that John liked John.

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:35.560
The natural interpretation,
in fact, is that Bill knew that

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.190
John liked Bill.
The two words co-refer.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:42.958
Contrast that with "Bill knew
that John liked himself," which

00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:46.350
only has the meaning Bill knew
that John liked John.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.353
And this is what linguists do
for a living so if you hear me

00:14:49.353 --> 00:14:52.564
talking about this and say,
"I want to spend the next forty

00:14:52.564 --> 00:14:56.090
years of my life studying that,"
you should become a linguist.

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.141
But that's the sort of--those
are the sort of phenomena that

00:14:59.141 --> 00:15:02.090
we're interested in.
Now, it gets more complicated.

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:05.474
Those are examples from syntax,
but language has many

00:15:05.474 --> 00:15:08.344
structures.
Language has structures going

00:15:08.344 --> 00:15:12.638
from the bottom to the top.
All languages--All human

00:15:12.638 --> 00:15:17.900
languages have phonology,
which is the system of sounds

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.840
or signs;
morphology, which is the system

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:26.039
of words or morphemes,
basic units of meaning;

00:15:26.039 --> 00:15:30.068
and syntax, which refer to
rules and principles that put

00:15:30.068 --> 00:15:34.169
together words and phrases into
meaningful utterances.

00:15:34.169 --> 00:15:38.543
And I want to talk briefly
about each of these three parts

00:15:38.543 --> 00:15:42.379
of language before looking at
some other issues.

00:15:42.379 --> 00:15:45.363
I'm indebted here to Steven
Pinker's excellent book The

00:15:45.363 --> 00:15:47.719
Language Instinct which
provides, I think,

00:15:47.719 --> 00:15:49.970
a superb discussion of these
phenomena.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.860
And I'm going to steal some of
my examples from Pinker.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:59.142
So, phonology.
Phonology is the system of

00:15:59.142 --> 00:16:01.580
sounds that languages have.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.066
There's a subset.
There's a list,

00:16:11.066 --> 00:16:13.081
a finite list,
of possible sounds that

00:16:13.081 --> 00:16:15.611
language can use.
I'm going to put aside for the

00:16:15.611 --> 00:16:18.350
moment the question of sign
languages and how they work.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.320
I'm going to talk about them in
a little bit.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:25.879
The idea is that English has
about forty of these phonemes.

00:16:25.879 --> 00:16:29.599
So, if you're a native
monolingual speaker of English

00:16:29.599 --> 00:16:33.604
you hear speech and each sound
you hear is categorized as

00:16:33.604 --> 00:16:37.037
falling into one of those forty
morphemes--sorry,

00:16:37.037 --> 00:16:39.965
phonemes.
So, for example,

00:16:39.965 --> 00:16:46.690
English has a phoneme of "lu,"
"l," and a phoneme of "r."

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:50.302
And so, an English speaker can
hear the difference between

00:16:50.302 --> 00:16:53.598
"lip" and "rip" and that
corresponds to two different

00:16:53.598 --> 00:16:57.305
words in English.
Other languages don't have that

00:16:57.305 --> 00:17:01.518
distinction and so those
distinctions are very difficult

00:17:01.518 --> 00:17:04.890
for non-native English speakers
to learn.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:09.148
So, part of what goes on when
you learn, is you have to learn

00:17:09.148 --> 00:17:12.839
the language--the phonemes that
your language has.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:17.089
Another part of the problem of
learning language is you have to

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:20.859
figure out what the boundaries
are between the words.

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:23.561
You have to use sound signals
to figure out the boundaries

00:17:23.561 --> 00:17:26.319
between the words.
Now that--If the only language

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:29.698
you've ever heard is English,
that's going to seem like a

00:17:29.698 --> 00:17:33.136
really weird example of a
problem because you're listening

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:36.695
to me speak and in between each
of my words you're hearing a

00:17:36.695 --> 00:17:38.993
pause.
You don't have to be very smart

00:17:38.993 --> 00:17:41.680
to figure out where one word
begins and one word ends.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.009
But the pause is a
psychological illusion.

00:17:45.009 --> 00:17:49.017
If you were to just talk into
an oscilloscope that measured

00:17:49.017 --> 00:17:52.679
your sound vibrations,
there are no pauses between the

00:17:52.679 --> 00:17:55.597
words.
Rather, the pauses are inserted

00:17:55.597 --> 00:17:59.692
by your mind as you already know
where one word begins and

00:17:59.692 --> 00:18:03.392
another one ends.
And you insert a pause at that

00:18:03.392 --> 00:18:05.967
point.
You could see this when you

00:18:05.967 --> 00:18:09.000
hear a language you don't
already know.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.261
So, for those of you who have
never heard French before,

00:18:12.261 --> 00:18:15.701
when you hear somebody say,
"Je ne sais pas" you could say,

00:18:15.701 --> 00:18:18.594
"Remarkable!
French has no pauses between

00:18:18.594 --> 00:18:21.270
words."
And you-- And now a French

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.859
speaker, of course,
hears "Je ne sais pas."

00:18:24.859 --> 00:18:28.278
For Hebrew, I know one sentence
in Hebrew: "Sleecha,

00:18:28.278 --> 00:18:31.898
eypho ha-sheeruteem" which I
think is a request for the

00:18:31.898 --> 00:18:35.087
bathroom.
But if you don't know Hebrew

00:18:35.087 --> 00:18:37.869
there's no pauses.
And the truth is,

00:18:37.869 --> 00:18:40.572
when you each gave your
demonstrations,

00:18:40.572 --> 00:18:44.342
nobody spoke properly because
nobody spoke--Here's the

00:18:44.342 --> 00:18:47.329
sentence: "Glorp fendel smug
wuggle."

00:18:47.329 --> 00:18:51.652
Rather, you all sounded like,
"blublublublublub" without any

00:18:51.652 --> 00:18:54.950
pauses because I don't know your
languages.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:59.553
Children come into the world
without knowing any specific

00:18:59.553 --> 00:19:03.170
language and so they have to
learn pauses.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:08.003
They have to learn to interpret
sounds in context and sometimes

00:19:08.003 --> 00:19:11.698
they make mistakes.
They get problems of

00:19:11.698 --> 00:19:13.903
segmentation.
And there are some

00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:16.287
illustrations.
You could see their mistakes if

00:19:16.287 --> 00:19:19.612
they're trying to repeat back
something that's already known

00:19:19.612 --> 00:19:22.640
within a society.
So, songs are a good example.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.460
These are excerpts from
children.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.490
"I'll never be your pizza
burnin'."

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:29.610
Anybody know--figure out what
that corresponds to?

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.948
Student: Beast of burden?
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:19:31.948 --> 00:19:33.690
"Beast of burden."
Very good.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:38.789
"A girl with colitis goes by."
Somebody?

00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:41.029
Student: "A girl with
kaleidoscope eyes."

00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:42.180
Professor Paul Bloom:
"The ants are my friends;

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:48.862
they're blowin' in the wind."
And [laughter]

00:19:48.862 --> 00:19:54.539
this is a religious one.
"Our father with Bart in heaven;

00:19:54.539 --> 00:19:59.444
Harold be they name… Lead us
not into Penn Station…" Now,

00:19:59.444 --> 00:20:04.185
phonological understanding
illustrates all sorts of aspects

00:20:04.185 --> 00:20:08.859
of language processing and,
in fact, of consciousness.

00:20:08.859 --> 00:20:13.414
Because remember I said that,
typically, when you hear a

00:20:13.414 --> 00:20:17.638
sentence you make--you
manufacture in your mind gaps

00:20:17.638 --> 00:20:21.258
between the words.
Typically, when there's

00:20:21.258 --> 00:20:25.325
something which is unclear
you'll fill in the gap and

00:20:25.325 --> 00:20:29.410
figure out what the word is.
And you'll hear it that way.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:32.323
So, the few examples--The best
examples, again,

00:20:32.323 --> 00:20:37.259
are for when it goes wrong.
So, a classic example is from

00:20:37.259 --> 00:20:41.319
the song "Super Freak" by Rick
James.

00:20:41.319 --> 00:20:46.086
I got a big lecture about
copyright laws and this is going

00:20:46.086 --> 00:20:49.270
to violate most of them.
Rick James is going to be

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.533
sitting on the--at--staring at
the web two years from now

00:20:51.533 --> 00:20:53.000
saying, "Hey.
That's my thing."

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.522
Okay.
So, I want you to listen to

00:20:55.522 --> 00:20:59.553
this line.
I'm sure most of you have heard

00:20:59.553 --> 00:21:04.530
this before but I want you to
listen closely.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.050
What was that last line?

00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:17.470
[laughter]
"The kind of girl you read

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:20.521
about--" Well,
it turns out that nobody really

00:21:20.521 --> 00:21:23.687
knows.
And it sounds to many people

00:21:23.687 --> 00:21:28.130
who do top-down interpretation
as--to me as well,

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.490
that "she's the kind of girl
you read about in

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:34.597
Newsweek magazine."
But that makes no sense at all

00:21:34.597 --> 00:21:39.079
given that you don't want to
"bring home to Mama."

00:21:39.079 --> 00:21:42.207
And she's--and it's not
the--and in fact,

00:21:42.207 --> 00:21:46.038
if you check the notes on the
song, she's in fact,

00:21:46.038 --> 00:21:50.730
"the kind of girl you read
about in new wave magazines."

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:57.233
Now, when you listen to it
then, again, knowing that,

00:21:57.233 --> 00:22:02.173
you hear it that way.
Now, this top-down--This is

00:22:02.173 --> 00:22:06.953
known as "top-down" processing.
Top-down processing is an

00:22:06.953 --> 00:22:12.366
example of when you know what
something is you hear it that

00:22:12.366 --> 00:22:16.212
way.
And this is extremely useful

00:22:16.212 --> 00:22:21.230
when it comes to filling in gaps
in sounds.

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:26.290
In normal conversation,
if I'm to say "s-- entence" you

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.570
won't hear that as "s--
entence."

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:32.250
Rather, you hear "sentence."
You fill in the gap.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:36.999
This can lead to problems.
The problem it's led to in my

00:22:36.999 --> 00:22:41.026
life revolves around the song
"Get Crunk" [laughter]

00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:45.685
because I've heard "Get Crunk"
and my children asked me if I

00:22:45.685 --> 00:22:49.160
would buy them "Get Crunk" from
iTunes.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.000
My children are eight and ten.
And now "Get Crunk," as I was

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.090
aware from having heard it
before, involves the consistent

00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:00.319
refrain of "get crunk" extremely
bad word,

00:23:00.319 --> 00:23:04.109
"get crunk" extremely bad word,
and so I said "no."

00:23:04.109 --> 00:23:06.264
And then they said,
"Well, there's a clean version

00:23:06.264 --> 00:23:09.118
of it."
So, I downloaded the clean

00:23:09.118 --> 00:23:10.987
version.
Unfortunately,

00:23:10.987 --> 00:23:14.766
knowing what the clean
version--knowing what the word

00:23:14.766 --> 00:23:18.690
is means to me the clean version
is not very clean.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.896
Now, I will add,
[laughter]

00:23:21.896 --> 00:23:28.680
before people write letters and
stuff, this is the clean

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.348
version.
[laughter]

00:23:31.348 --> 00:23:37.170
Thank goodness they took away
that obscene word.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:42.100
[laughter] Okay.
So, top-down processing affects

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.313
how we hear things,
usually, almost always,

00:23:45.313 --> 00:23:47.395
for the better.
And in fact,

00:23:47.395 --> 00:23:50.804
this is a theme we're going to
return to next class when we

00:23:50.804 --> 00:23:54.213
talk about vision because the
same thing is going to happen

00:23:54.213 --> 00:23:57.686
there.
How we see the world is often

00:23:57.686 --> 00:24:03.730
confusing and befuddled but what
we know can clear things up.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:04.630
Same with sound.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.840
Morphology is the next level up.
Phonology is sounds.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.280
Morphology is words.
And human language uses this

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.812
amazing trick described by
Ferdinand de Saussure,

00:24:19.812 --> 00:24:23.270
the great linguist,
as "the arbitrariness of the

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:26.593
sign."
And what this means is we can

00:24:26.593 --> 00:24:31.880
use--take any arbitrary idea in
the world, the idea of a chair

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:36.704
or a story or a country,
and make a sound or a sign to

00:24:36.704 --> 00:24:40.160
connect to it.
And the link is arbitrary.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.750
You might choose to use a word
for "dog" as "woof woof" because

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:49.044
it sounds like a dog but you
can't use a word for "country"

00:24:49.044 --> 00:24:53.078
that sounds like a country.
You could use a sign language

00:24:53.078 --> 00:24:56.674
thing for "drink" that looks
sort of like the act of drinking

00:24:56.674 --> 00:25:00.031
but you can't use a sign
language word for "country" that

00:25:00.031 --> 00:25:03.780
looks like a country,
or for "idea" that looks like

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.618
an idea.
So, the way languages work is

00:25:06.618 --> 00:25:11.821
it allows for arbitrary naming.
It allows for this map between

00:25:11.821 --> 00:25:17.369
a symbol, say a spoken word,
and any sort of thought we want

00:25:17.369 --> 00:25:20.823
to use.
And those arbitrary mappings,

00:25:20.823 --> 00:25:25.329
as we come to learn them,
make up the vocabulary of a

00:25:25.329 --> 00:25:28.690
language.
I'm talking about words but the

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.309
more technical term is
"morpheme."

00:25:31.309 --> 00:25:35.546
And what a morpheme is is the
smallest meaningful unit in a

00:25:35.546 --> 00:25:38.221
language.
Now often, this is the same

00:25:38.221 --> 00:25:40.789
thing as a word.
So, "dog" is a word.

00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:43.991
And "dog" is also a morpheme,
but not always because there

00:25:43.991 --> 00:25:46.968
are single morphemes and then
there are words that are

00:25:46.968 --> 00:25:51.466
composed of many morphemes.
So, "dogs" and "complained" are

00:25:51.466 --> 00:25:57.069
one word, but two morphemes and
what this means is that you make

00:25:57.069 --> 00:26:01.160
the word by putting together two
morphemes.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.435
To put it differently,
in order to know what "dogs"

00:26:04.435 --> 00:26:07.579
means, you never had to learn
the word "dogs."

00:26:07.579 --> 00:26:11.628
All you had to know is the word
"dog" and the plural morpheme

00:26:11.628 --> 00:26:15.339
's' and you could put them
together to create a word.

00:26:15.339 --> 00:26:20.020
How many morphemes does the
average speaker know?

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:25.217
The answer is fairly startling.
The average speaker knows,

00:26:25.217 --> 00:26:28.970
as a low-ball estimate,
about 60,000 words.

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:34.849
I think the proper estimate is
closer to 80,000 or 100,000.

00:26:34.849 --> 00:26:37.027
What this means,
if you average it out,

00:26:37.027 --> 00:26:40.294
is that since children start
learning their first words at

00:26:40.294 --> 00:26:44.959
about their first year of life,
they learn about nine new words

00:26:44.959 --> 00:26:49.772
a day.
And it's not a continuous nine

00:26:49.772 --> 00:26:54.013
words every day.
It goes up and down depending

00:26:54.013 --> 00:26:56.800
on the age.
But still, the amount of words

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.710
we know is staggering.
How many of you know more than

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:04.891
one language pretty fluently?
Those of you who know other

00:27:04.891 --> 00:27:08.804
languages might have in your
heads 200,000 words or 300,000

00:27:08.804 --> 00:27:12.920
words and you're accessing them
in a fraction of a second.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:18.254
It is--could legitimately be
seen as one of the most

00:27:18.254 --> 00:27:22.020
astonishing things that people
do.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:26.028
Finally, syntax.
So, we have the sound system of

00:27:26.028 --> 00:27:29.381
a language, the phonology.
We have the words of a

00:27:29.381 --> 00:27:33.360
language, the morphology,
but all that gives you is

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.420
"dog," "cup," "chair," "house,"
"story," "idea."

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.299
That won't allow us to
communicate complicated ideas.

00:27:41.299 --> 00:27:45.059
So, the final step in the story
is syntax.

00:27:45.059 --> 00:27:49.423
And syntax refers to those
rules and principles that allow

00:27:49.423 --> 00:27:54.170
us to combine words into phrases
and phrases into sentences.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:59.616
And syntax uses another neat
trick and this is defined by

00:27:59.616 --> 00:28:05.550
Wilhelm von Humboldt as the
"infinite use of finite media."

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:09.170
So, here's the question.
Your vocabulary is finite.

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:12.681
There are just so many words.
You have to learn them one by

00:28:12.681 --> 00:28:16.720
one, but you could produce a
virtual infinity of sentences.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:20.738
How can you do that?
How can you go from a finite

00:28:20.738 --> 00:28:25.359
list of symbols to an infinite
number of sentences?

00:28:25.359 --> 00:28:30.789
And the answer is you have a
combinatorial system.

00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:34.965
Now, language is not the only
thing in culture or nature that

00:28:34.965 --> 00:28:37.750
has this sort of combinatorial
system.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:40.789
Music also has a combinatorial
system.

00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:43.839
There's a finite number of
notes but a limitless number of

00:28:43.839 --> 00:28:47.545
musical compositions.
DNA also has this sort of

00:28:47.545 --> 00:28:53.089
combinatorial system where you
have a finite number of,

00:28:53.089 --> 00:28:57.176
I guess, bases or amino acids
that could combine to a possible

00:28:57.176 --> 00:29:00.810
infinity of strings,
of DNA strings.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:08.233
So, how does this happen?
Well, the infinity mechanism,

00:29:08.233 --> 00:29:11.253
and many of you will be
familiar with this from

00:29:11.253 --> 00:29:14.470
mathematics or computer science,
is recursion.

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:17.744
And there's a lot to be said
about this but it could be

00:29:17.744 --> 00:29:20.170
pretty simply illustrated in
language.

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:22.680
So, here's an example of a
simple language.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:27.001
It's not--It's actually close
to how linguists describe normal

00:29:27.001 --> 00:29:31.089
languages, but it's very simple.
It has three nouns,

00:29:31.089 --> 00:29:34.889
"Fred," "Barney" and "Wilma,"
and two verbs,

00:29:34.889 --> 00:29:38.590
"thinks" and "likes."
A very simple language.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:42.783
And one rule.
And the way to read this rule

00:29:42.783 --> 00:29:47.046
is you make a sentence by taking
a noun, any noun,

00:29:47.046 --> 00:29:51.570
putting a verb after it,
and then following that verb

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:54.849
with a noun.
Now, when you do this,

00:29:54.849 --> 00:29:57.712
how many--And then so,
for instance,

00:29:57.712 --> 00:30:01.230
you get the sentence "Fred
likes Wilma."

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:04.349
When you do this,
how many possible sentences are

00:30:04.349 --> 00:30:06.910
there?
Let me just take a second.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:12.900
Okay.
Any guesses?

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.268
Eighteen.
The sentences are "Fred likes

00:30:16.268 --> 00:30:19.130
Fred," "Fred likes Barney,"
"Fred likes Wilma,"

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:21.976
"Fred thinks Fred," "Fred
thinks Barney," "Fred thinks

00:30:21.976 --> 00:30:25.028
Wilma," and so on.
The three nouns followed by any

00:30:25.028 --> 00:30:28.410
of the two verbs followed by any
of the three nouns.

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.740
That is not a very interesting
language.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:34.777
But now, take a more
complicated language--same

00:30:34.777 --> 00:30:39.341
vocabulary, the same three
nouns, the same two verbs,

00:30:39.341 --> 00:30:43.730
the same sentence,
but now one other sentence.

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:48.529
This sentence expands to a noun
followed by a verb followed by a

00:30:48.529 --> 00:30:51.500
sentence and there you get
recursion.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:57.960
You have one rule invoking
another rule and then you can

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:04.420
get a sentence like "Fred thinks
Barney likes Wilma."

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:09.180
And here you get a potential
infinity of sentences.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:14.201
And this is obviously a toy
example but you could see the

00:31:14.201 --> 00:31:19.134
use of recursion in everyday
life and in everyday use of

00:31:19.134 --> 00:31:21.180
language.
You could say,

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:24.701
"John hates cheese," "My
roommate heard a rumor that John

00:31:24.701 --> 00:31:26.900
hates cheese,"
"It disturbed Mary when I told

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.160
her that my roommate heard a
rumor that John hates cheese,"

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.263
"I was amazed that it disturbed
Mary when I told her that my

00:31:31.263 --> 00:31:33.009
roommate heard a rumor that John
hates cheese,"

00:31:33.009 --> 00:31:34.890
"Professor Bloom had devoted
way too much of his lecture

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:36.258
talking about how I was amazed
[laughter]

00:31:36.258 --> 00:31:38.310
that it disturbed Mary when I
told her that my roommate heard

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:42.119
a rumor that John hates cheese,"
"It really bothered me that--"

00:31:42.119 --> 00:31:46.079
and there's no limit.
There's no longest sentence.

00:31:46.079 --> 00:31:49.213
You could keep producing a
sentence deeper and deeper

00:31:49.213 --> 00:31:52.867
embedded until you die.
And this is part of the power

00:31:52.867 --> 00:31:56.247
of language.
Now, the syntactic rules are

00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:59.136
complicated.
And one of the puzzles of

00:31:59.136 --> 00:32:02.315
syntactic rules,
or one of the issues of them,

00:32:02.315 --> 00:32:06.130
is that different rules can
conspire to create the same

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:08.771
sentence.
So, you take a sentence

00:32:08.771 --> 00:32:12.074
like--This is a classic line
from Groucho Marx:

00:32:12.074 --> 00:32:15.089
"I once shot an elephant in my
pajamas.

00:32:15.089 --> 00:32:17.910
How it got into my pajamas I'll
never know."

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:20.131
And the humor,
such that it is,

00:32:20.131 --> 00:32:24.204
revolves around the ambiguity
of rules that generate it,

00:32:24.204 --> 00:32:29.553
like this versus like this.
Often, to illustrate the issues

00:32:29.553 --> 00:32:33.591
of ambiguity,
people have collected poorly

00:32:33.591 --> 00:32:38.614
thought-out headlines in
newspaper reports that play

00:32:38.614 --> 00:32:42.849
on--that inadvertently have
ambiguity.

00:32:42.849 --> 00:32:45.809
"Complaints about NBA referees
growing ugly."

00:32:45.809 --> 00:32:48.730
So, that's the beauty of that
structure.

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:54.461
"Kids make nutritious snacks."
"No one was injured in a blast

00:32:54.461 --> 00:32:58.314
which was attributed to the
buildup of gas by one town

00:32:58.314 --> 00:33:01.811
official."
Last summer I was in Seoul

00:33:01.811 --> 00:33:07.602
visiting the--visiting Korea
University and the big headline

00:33:07.602 --> 00:33:13.197
there on the front page was
"General arrested for fondling

00:33:13.197 --> 00:33:15.522
privates."
[laughter]

00:33:15.522 --> 00:33:20.126
Now, there actually is--The
ambiguity is actually quite

00:33:20.126 --> 00:33:24.815
difficult to avoid in the
construction and understanding

00:33:24.815 --> 00:33:28.047
of sentences.
It's one of the ways in which

00:33:28.047 --> 00:33:31.089
it's often difficult to write
clearly, and in fact,

00:33:31.089 --> 00:33:36.125
there's a whole sub-field of
the law involving the use of

00:33:36.125 --> 00:33:40.621
linguistic theory to
disambiguate sentences both in

00:33:40.621 --> 00:33:44.357
the Constitution,
in legislation,

00:33:44.357 --> 00:33:48.670
as well as in some criminal
cases.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:51.837
And there was,
several years ago,

00:33:51.837 --> 00:33:57.480
a very serious criminal case
that rested on a sentence.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.438
And here's what happened.
There were two brothers,

00:34:00.438 --> 00:34:03.599
one of them retarded,
and they get into a robbery.

00:34:03.599 --> 00:34:09.289
And a police officer sees them
and points the gun at them.

00:34:09.289 --> 00:34:15.480
And one of the brothers points
a gun at the police officer.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:19.683
The police officer shouts for
the brother, the non-retarded

00:34:19.683 --> 00:34:23.138
brother, to drop the gun.
Actually, he said,

00:34:23.138 --> 00:34:27.294
"Give me the gun."
The retarded brother shouted,

00:34:27.294 --> 00:34:32.532
"Let him have it," whereupon
the brother shot and killed the

00:34:32.532 --> 00:34:35.842
police officer.
Now, the brother who did the

00:34:35.842 --> 00:34:39.347
shooting was plainly a murderer.
What about that brother who

00:34:39.347 --> 00:34:43.448
shouted, "Let him have it"?
Well, it depends on what he--on

00:34:43.448 --> 00:34:47.906
how you interpret that sentence
because the sentence is

00:34:47.906 --> 00:34:52.189
beautifully ambiguous.
It could mean "shoot him,

00:34:52.189 --> 00:34:56.804
let him have it," or it could
mean "give him the gun,

00:34:56.804 --> 00:34:59.167
let him have it."
And in fact,

00:34:59.167 --> 00:35:01.762
the trial, which I think
somebody could--If people out

00:35:01.762 --> 00:35:04.260
there know about this,
please send me an e-mail.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:08.630
My understanding was he was
found guilty but a lot to turn

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:13.349
on the ambiguity of a sentence.
I want to shift now and talk

00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:17.495
about where does all this
knowledge come from but I'll

00:35:17.495 --> 00:35:22.110
stop and answer any questions
about the material so far.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:24.809
What are your questions?
Yes.

00:35:24.809 --> 00:35:27.565
Student: How does syntax
differ from grammar or are they

00:35:27.565 --> 00:35:29.207
exactly the same?
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:35:29.207 --> 00:35:30.718
Syntax--The question is,
"How is syntax different from

00:35:30.718 --> 00:35:33.119
grammar?"
They're exactly the same.

00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:39.451
Syntax is a more technical term
but it means the same thing as

00:35:39.451 --> 00:35:41.510
grammar.
Yes.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:44.590
Student: You said that
every normal human being that's

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:47.619
born uses at some point or
another some kind of language.

00:35:47.619 --> 00:35:52.618
Aren't there people who weren't
born within a culture and grew

00:35:52.618 --> 00:35:57.207
up and who never really spoke a
language though they were

00:35:57.207 --> 00:35:59.561
physically normal?
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:35:59.561 --> 00:36:01.037
Yes.
I'm glad you actually asked me

00:36:01.037 --> 00:36:02.506
about that because,
as I said it,

00:36:02.506 --> 00:36:04.159
I realized it wasn't quite
right.

00:36:04.159 --> 00:36:07.942
The point that was just raised
here is I had said before that

00:36:07.942 --> 00:36:11.536
everybody who's neurologically
normal comes to acquire and

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:14.606
learn a language.
But what about people who are

00:36:14.606 --> 00:36:18.460
neurologically normal but they
don't have language around them?

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.166
And in fact,
there have been,

00:36:20.166 --> 00:36:22.300
historically,
some cases of this.

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.662
There's been,
probably apocryphal,

00:36:24.662 --> 00:36:29.030
stories about children who are
raised by wolves or by dogs.

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:31.525
There are stories,
horrible stories,

00:36:31.525 --> 00:36:35.732
some in the twentieth century,
about children who are locked

00:36:35.732 --> 00:36:40.510
away by insane or evil parents
and have never learned to speak.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:43.738
There are stories of deaf
people who are within certain

00:36:43.738 --> 00:36:47.206
societies where nobody signs to
them, and so they're what's

00:36:47.206 --> 00:36:50.979
known as linguistic isolates.
And they themselves never learn

00:36:50.979 --> 00:36:53.337
to speak.
And those cases are the

00:36:53.337 --> 00:36:57.280
dramatic exception and they do
tell you something.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.118
They tell you that it's not
enough to have a brain for

00:36:59.118 --> 00:37:02.300
language.
Somebody does have to use it

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.500
with you.
Interestingly,

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.929
it doesn't have to be that many
people.

00:37:07.929 --> 00:37:11.533
So, Susan Goldin-Meadow has
studied deaf children that

00:37:11.533 --> 00:37:15.476
nobody signed to but what she
studies is deaf children with

00:37:15.476 --> 00:37:19.420
deaf siblings and these children
don't just sit there.

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:23.052
They create their own language.
It's not a full-blown language

00:37:23.052 --> 00:37:25.656
like American sign-language or
langue des signes

00:37:25.656 --> 00:37:28.260
quebecoise but it's a
language nonetheless,

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:31.030
with words and syntax and
phonology.

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:39.400
It's an interesting question.
Any other questions?

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:46.154
Yes.
Student: Could it be

00:37:46.154 --> 00:37:56.460
argued that there are inherent
limits to grammar?

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:58.059
Professor Paul Bloom:
It's a good question.

00:37:58.059 --> 00:38:00.630
The question is,
"Are there inherent limits in

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:03.030
our abilities to come up with
grammars?"

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:07.180
And most linguists would argue
"yes," that languages are highly

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.590
constrained in how they do
things.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:12.947
So, for instance,
one example is there's no

00:38:12.947 --> 00:38:17.343
language in the world that ever
constructs a question by

00:38:17.343 --> 00:38:21.659
switching the order of words
around in a sentence.

00:38:21.659 --> 00:38:25.731
There's no language in the
world that has a rule that says

00:38:25.731 --> 00:38:29.559
the fifth word has to be a verb.
And linguists have all of these

00:38:29.559 --> 00:38:31.862
conditions they say,
"no language in the world works

00:38:31.862 --> 00:38:33.462
this way."
Now this is--;So,

00:38:33.462 --> 00:38:36.440
these are constraints on
grammar and they're really

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.775
interesting because they tell us
what's a humanly natural

00:38:39.775 --> 00:38:43.289
language versus what's not a
humanly natural language.

00:38:43.289 --> 00:38:46.603
But notice, even if there is
incredible constraints on

00:38:46.603 --> 00:38:50.354
grammars, still--we could still
produce an infinite number of

00:38:50.354 --> 00:38:53.458
sentences.
It's just like if you restrict

00:38:53.458 --> 00:38:57.321
me to only a subset of numbers,
only the odd numbers,

00:38:57.321 --> 00:39:00.590
still there's an infinity of
odd numbers.

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:07.132
So, grammar can be restricted
but still give rise to an

00:39:07.132 --> 00:39:13.204
infinity of possible sentences.
Well, there's a radical claim

00:39:13.204 --> 00:39:17.354
about the origin of language
associated with the guy who we

00:39:17.354 --> 00:39:20.932
met when we talked about
behaviorism who wrote A

00:39:20.932 --> 00:39:24.949
Review of Verbal Behavior,
 the linguist Noam Chomsky.

00:39:24.949 --> 00:39:28.079
And Chomsky makes this radical
claim.

00:39:28.079 --> 00:39:31.297
And this is that we shouldn't
view language learning as

00:39:31.297 --> 00:39:34.230
learning at all.
Instead, we should view it as

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:37.190
something similar to growth.
So he says, 

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:39.880
No one would take
seriously the proposal that a

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.933
human organism learns through
experience to have arms rather

00:39:42.933 --> 00:39:45.138
than wings,
or that the basic structure of

00:39:45.138 --> 00:39:47.710
particular organs results from
accidental experience.

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:49.641
[Language]
proves to be no less marvelous

00:39:49.641 --> 00:39:51.909
and intricate than these
physical structures.

00:39:51.909 --> 00:39:55.329
Why, then, should we not study
the acquisition of a cognitive

00:39:55.329 --> 00:39:58.749
structure like language more or
less as we study some complex

00:39:58.749 --> 00:40:01.775
bodily organ?
So, you might learn to play

00:40:01.775 --> 00:40:05.205
baseball, you might learn about
the American Civil War,

00:40:05.205 --> 00:40:09.079
but if Chomsky is right you
didn't learn to speak English.

00:40:09.079 --> 00:40:12.850
Rather, what happened is you
heard English and--but the

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:17.109
capacity grew in your head and
something a lot more similar to

00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:20.950
the development of arms or legs
or a visual system.

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:25.559
Well, should we believe this?
We know there has to be some

00:40:25.559 --> 00:40:28.828
effect of the environment
shaping language,

00:40:28.828 --> 00:40:31.107
obviously,
because in order to know

00:40:31.107 --> 00:40:34.329
English you have to have heard
English, in order to know Dutch

00:40:34.329 --> 00:40:37.884
you have had to heard,
to--had to have learned and

00:40:37.884 --> 00:40:39.569
heard Dutch.
And in fact,

00:40:39.569 --> 00:40:42.670
languages differ in all the
ways that we were talking about.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:46.708
Some languages like English has
a--have a distinction between

00:40:46.708 --> 00:40:49.440
‘l' and ‘r.'
Other languages do not.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.898
For a language like English,
that creature there is referred

00:40:53.898 --> 00:40:57.655
to with the morpheme "dog."
That's a historical accident of

00:40:57.655 --> 00:41:01.855
English.
In French it's chien and

00:41:01.855 --> 00:41:06.615
in Greek it's something else.
And each of those 6,000

00:41:06.615 --> 00:41:09.724
languages and people in the room
who know another language would

00:41:09.724 --> 00:41:11.539
say,
"Yeah, in Vietnamese it's

00:41:11.539 --> 00:41:14.480
this," "In Urdu it's this," "In
Czech it's that."

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:19.760
Finally, there is syntax.
So, English is what's known as

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:24.292
a subject-verb-object language.
That means if you want to

00:41:24.292 --> 00:41:28.217
convey the idea that Bill hit
John, you would say,

00:41:28.217 --> 00:41:32.099
"Bill hit John."
But not all languages work that

00:41:32.099 --> 00:41:34.139
way.
In fact, the majority of

00:41:34.139 --> 00:41:36.767
languages, more languages,
are actually

00:41:36.767 --> 00:41:40.338
subject-object-verb languages.
So, you would say,

00:41:40.338 --> 00:41:44.632
if you wanted to convey that
Bill was the hitter and John was

00:41:44.632 --> 00:41:48.260
hit, "Bill John hit."
All of this has to be learned.

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.756
And all of this has to be
learned through exposure to

00:41:51.756 --> 00:41:54.499
language users.
On the other hand,

00:41:54.499 --> 00:41:59.741
there is considerable evidence
that the development of these

00:41:59.741 --> 00:42:02.814
language skills,
in some way,

00:42:02.814 --> 00:42:09.159
is similar to growth in the way
that Chomsky suggests.

00:42:09.159 --> 00:42:12.469
So, here are some basic facts
about language development.

00:42:12.469 --> 00:42:15.039
One is something which I had
mentioned before.

00:42:15.039 --> 00:42:21.920
All normal children learn
language.

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:25.019
There can be specific
impairments of language.

00:42:25.019 --> 00:42:28.011
Now, again, we spoke about them
before when talking about the

00:42:28.011 --> 00:42:30.845
brain.
Some of these impairments could

00:42:30.845 --> 00:42:33.360
be due to trauma,
the aphasias.

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:38.159
Trauma, a blow to the head,
a stroke can rid you of your

00:42:38.159 --> 00:42:40.947
language.
But, also, there are genetic

00:42:40.947 --> 00:42:44.731
disorders, some falling under
the rubric of what's known as

00:42:44.731 --> 00:42:49.889
"specific language impairment,"
where children are born without

00:42:49.889 --> 00:42:55.010
the same ability as the rest of
us to learn to speak.

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:58.130
And these are interesting in
many ways.

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:01.347
One reason that they're
interesting is that they

00:43:01.347 --> 00:43:04.360
illustrate something about human
language.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.101
It is not--It would not be
unreasonable for you to think

00:43:08.101 --> 00:43:10.889
before listening to his lecture,
"Look.

00:43:10.889 --> 00:43:14.974
All you need to have to learn a
language is to be smart" or "All

00:43:14.974 --> 00:43:18.151
you need to have to learn a
language is to want to

00:43:18.151 --> 00:43:22.171
communicate" or "All you need to
have to learn a language is to

00:43:22.171 --> 00:43:25.477
be a social person wanting
to--having the ability to

00:43:25.477 --> 00:43:28.590
understand others and deal with
others."

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:32.208
But the cases of specific
language impairments suggest

00:43:32.208 --> 00:43:36.336
that all of that is wrong,
because there are children in

00:43:36.336 --> 00:43:39.470
this world right now who are
plenty smart,

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:44.682
who really want to communicate,
and who are entirely social

00:43:44.682 --> 00:43:48.650
creatures but they can't learn
language.

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:52.522
And this suggests that the
ability to learn language and

00:43:52.522 --> 00:43:56.888
understand language is to some
extent separate from these other

00:43:56.888 --> 00:44:00.763
aspects of mental life.
Continuing on this theme,

00:44:00.763 --> 00:44:05.105
we also know that language is
learnt without any sort of

00:44:05.105 --> 00:44:08.917
feedback or training.
There are many Americans who

00:44:08.917 --> 00:44:12.820
believe that they need to teach
their children language.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:16.151
And there's a huge industry
with DVDs and flash cards and

00:44:16.151 --> 00:44:19.900
all sorts of things designed to
teach your children language.

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:22.392
And I think many parents
believe that if they didn't

00:44:22.392 --> 00:44:25.374
persist in using these things
their children would never learn

00:44:25.374 --> 00:44:28.112
to speak.
But we know that that's not

00:44:28.112 --> 00:44:30.820
true.
We know that this isn't true

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:35.619
because there are communities
where they don't speak to their

00:44:35.619 --> 00:44:37.772
kids.
They don't speak to their kids

00:44:37.772 --> 00:44:40.696
because they don't believe it's
important to speak to their

00:44:40.696 --> 00:44:42.348
kids.
Some linguists would

00:44:42.348 --> 00:44:45.532
interview--Linguists would
interview adults in these

00:44:45.532 --> 00:44:48.528
communities and say,
"Why don't you speak to your

00:44:48.528 --> 00:44:51.523
babies?"
And these adults would respond,

00:44:51.523 --> 00:44:54.340
"It'd be ridiculous to speak to
a baby.

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:58.562
The baby has nothing to say.
You might as well just speak to

00:44:58.562 --> 00:45:00.687
your dog."
And then the American linguist

00:45:00.687 --> 00:45:05.469
would say, "Yeah.
We speak to our dogs."

00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:07.629
[laughter]
Americans and Europeans speak

00:45:07.629 --> 00:45:10.960
to everything and everybody.
Other cultures are more picky

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:14.242
and they don't talk to their
children until their children

00:45:14.242 --> 00:45:17.694
themselves are talking.
This doesn't seem to make much

00:45:17.694 --> 00:45:20.170
of a difference in language
learning.

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:24.188
Some studies have,
motivated by Chomsky's work in

00:45:24.188 --> 00:45:28.206
expressed--sorry,
motivated by Chomsky's critique

00:45:28.206 --> 00:45:33.137
of Skinner's Verbal Behavior,
 have asked even in-- "What

00:45:33.137 --> 00:45:36.599
if we just looked at children
within the United States?

00:45:36.599 --> 00:45:39.830
Don't these children get
feedback?"

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:45.628
And the answer is yes and no.
So your average highly educated

00:45:45.628 --> 00:45:50.425
Western parent does give their
children feedback--do give their

00:45:50.425 --> 00:45:53.829
children feedback based on what
they say.

00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:58.961
But they don't typically give
feedback based on the syntax or

00:45:58.961 --> 00:46:03.730
grammaticality of what they say.
The example given by Brown and

00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:07.326
Hanlon in the classic study in
the 1970s is they did all of

00:46:07.326 --> 00:46:10.860
these studies looking at what
children say and how parents

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:13.859
responded,
and it turns out parents

00:46:13.859 --> 00:46:19.205
respond not to the grammatical
correctness but to the affect or

00:46:19.205 --> 00:46:23.000
cuteness or sociability of the
utterance.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.032
So for instance,
if a child says to his mother,

00:46:26.032 --> 00:46:28.668
"I loves you,
Mommy," it's a very unusual

00:46:28.668 --> 00:46:30.910
parent who would say,
"Oh, no.

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:34.820
The verb agreement is mistaken.
[laughter]

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:38.719
You've added a redundant ‘s.'
It's not appropriate."

00:46:38.719 --> 00:46:42.171
Similarly, if a child is to
say, "I hate your guts,

00:46:42.171 --> 00:46:45.830
Mother," it's an unusual
mother, "That's wonderful.

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:48.852
There's a subject, verb, object.
The whole thing's structurally

00:46:48.852 --> 00:46:51.004
fine."
We respond to our kids like we

00:46:51.004 --> 00:46:54.396
respond to each other based on
the message that's conveyed,

00:46:54.396 --> 00:46:56.969
not the grammaticality of the
utterances.

00:46:56.969 --> 00:47:00.794
Children make grammatical
mistakes all the time but then

00:47:00.794 --> 00:47:04.340
they go away and they go away
without correction.

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:09.143
So those are some basic facts.
What do we know about the time

00:47:09.143 --> 00:47:13.354
course of language?
Well, early on children start

00:47:13.354 --> 00:47:18.260
off and they prefer the melody
of their own language.

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:23.389
These studies were done in
France with four-day-old babies.

00:47:23.389 --> 00:47:26.639
And what they did was they used
a sucking method.

00:47:26.639 --> 00:47:28.860
Remember, there's a limited
number of things babies can do.

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:32.559
One of the things they can do
is suck, and these babies would

00:47:32.559 --> 00:47:34.780
suck on a pacifier to hear
French.

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:41.119
And they would prefer to hear
French than to hear Russian.

00:47:41.119 --> 00:47:45.391
And these investigators claimed
this is because they had been

00:47:45.391 --> 00:47:49.519
exposed to French in the first
four days of their lives.

00:47:49.519 --> 00:47:53.395
Reviewers, mostly from France,
objected and said,

00:47:53.395 --> 00:47:55.429
"No.
Maybe French just sounds better.

00:47:55.429 --> 00:47:57.840
Everybody's going to like
French."

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:00.239
So, they re-did the study in
Russia.

00:48:00.239 --> 00:48:03.893
Russian kids sucked harder to
hear Russian than they did to

00:48:03.893 --> 00:48:06.263
French.
And what they're listening to

00:48:06.263 --> 00:48:08.380
isn't the words.
They don't know words yet.

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:11.539
They don't know of syntax yet.
It's the rhythm of the language.

00:48:11.539 --> 00:48:14.570
For you, French and Russian
sound different.

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:17.123
Even if you're like me and you
don't know a word of either

00:48:17.123 --> 00:48:18.869
language, they still sound
different.

00:48:18.869 --> 00:48:22.079
They sound different to babies
too.

00:48:22.079 --> 00:48:27.295
And a baby being raised in
France or a baby being raised in

00:48:27.295 --> 00:48:32.240
Russia knows enough to tell
what's his language and what

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.738
isn't.
Early on, children are

00:48:35.738 --> 00:48:40.110
sensitive to every phoneme there
is.

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:42.898
So, English-speaking children,
for instance,

00:48:42.898 --> 00:48:46.660
can--English-speaking babies
– babies who are born in the

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:49.773
United States – can
distinguish between English

00:48:49.773 --> 00:48:53.665
phonemes like "lip" and "rip"
but they could also distinguish

00:48:53.665 --> 00:48:58.269
between phonemic contrasts that
are not exemplified in English,

00:48:58.269 --> 00:49:00.920
such as phonemic contrasts in
Czech or Hindi.

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.379
Yes.
Student:

00:49:02.379 --> 00:49:06.035
I'm wondering if you can say
the wrong things to them--to

00:49:06.035 --> 00:49:09.170
infants based on what you were
saying before.

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:11.542
Because I was in France one
summer and I had some neighbors

00:49:11.542 --> 00:49:13.610
there.
I hated these neighbors,

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:18.906
I thought they were stupid.
Not because they were French,

00:49:18.906 --> 00:49:25.100
but they had a baby and it
would gaggle and coo and they

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:30.096
would respond in similar terms.
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:49:30.096 --> 00:49:31.929
They would gaggle and coo back
at the baby.

00:49:31.929 --> 00:49:34.210
Student: [inaudible]
And I hate these people.

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:40.737
[inaudible]
So I don't know if it--Does it

00:49:40.737 --> 00:49:50.449
matter what you say to babies as
long as you say something.

00:49:50.449 --> 00:49:54.510
Professor Paul Bloom:
There's a lot going on in your

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:55.722
question.
[laughter]

00:49:55.722 --> 00:49:57.889
Some raising--Well,
there's a lot going on in your

00:49:57.889 --> 00:50:00.166
question.
The answer to the question--

00:50:00.166 --> 00:50:03.034
The question was,
"your baby's going to coo and

00:50:03.034 --> 00:50:06.402
'ga ga, goo goo,' does it matter
if you coo and 'ga ga,

00:50:06.402 --> 00:50:08.687
goo goo' back?"
No, it doesn't make a

00:50:08.687 --> 00:50:11.929
difference.
Your hatred towards them was

00:50:11.929 --> 00:50:15.089
unmotivated.
You can be relieved of that

00:50:15.089 --> 00:50:18.590
debt, or now you know you feel
bad now, I guess.

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:22.040
[laughter]
If you speak to your children

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:25.579
in perfect English,
it's very strange.

00:50:25.579 --> 00:50:28.170
Nobody speaks to their babies
in, "Hello, Son.

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:31.364
It's time--Oh.
You want to change your diaper

00:50:31.364 --> 00:50:34.090
right now so stay still."
That's bad parenting.

00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:36.379
It sounds kind of silly.
More--What most people do is,

00:50:36.379 --> 00:50:38.000
"Oh.
You're such a cute little baby."

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.612
And it probably--One--T
here's--Evolutionary

00:50:41.612 --> 00:50:46.315
psychologists debate the
function of why we talk funny to

00:50:46.315 --> 00:50:48.863
babies.
And some people have argued

00:50:48.863 --> 00:50:51.449
that it does help their language
learning.

00:50:51.449 --> 00:50:55.085
And some people have argued
instead that what it does is it

00:50:55.085 --> 00:50:57.855
calms them.
They like to hear the music of

00:50:57.855 --> 00:51:01.083
a smooth voice and so on.
But whether or not you do so

00:51:01.083 --> 00:51:03.219
doesn't seem to make a big
difference.

00:51:03.219 --> 00:51:07.440
It is very difficult to find
any effect of how parents talk

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:10.786
to their kids on how their kids
learn language,

00:51:10.786 --> 00:51:13.769
particularly when it comes to
babies.

00:51:13.769 --> 00:51:19.498
So, early on babies can--are
sensitive to all phonemes and

00:51:19.498 --> 00:51:23.202
then that goes away.
Around twelve months of age it

00:51:23.202 --> 00:51:26.144
goes away.
This is one thing you were much

00:51:26.144 --> 00:51:29.929
better at when you were a baby
than you are now.

00:51:29.929 --> 00:51:33.329
When you were a baby you were a
multilingual fool.

00:51:33.329 --> 00:51:38.989
You could understand the sound
differences of every language on

00:51:38.989 --> 00:51:41.180
earth.
Now, if you're like me,

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:43.530
you could barely understand
English.

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:46.313
[laughter]
You narrow down until you're

00:51:46.313 --> 00:51:49.389
sensitive just to the language
you hear.

00:51:49.389 --> 00:51:55.095
And this narrowing down is
largely in place by about twelve

00:51:55.095 --> 00:51:59.710
months of age.
Around seven months is babbling.

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:04.396
And I want to stop at this
point to go back to the issue--I

00:52:04.396 --> 00:52:09.325
promised you I would turn a bit
to sign language and I want to

00:52:09.325 --> 00:52:14.174
describe now a very elegant--I
want to show a little film now

00:52:14.174 --> 00:52:18.457
of a very elegant series of
experiments looking at the

00:52:18.457 --> 00:52:23.386
question of whether babies who
are exposed to a sign language,

00:52:23.386 --> 00:52:26.862
babble.
One of the real surprising

00:52:26.862 --> 00:52:31.634
findings in my field over the
last ten/twenty years has been

00:52:31.634 --> 00:52:36.324
that the acquisition of sign
languages has turned out to be

00:52:36.324 --> 00:52:40.084
almost exactly the same;
in fact, as far as we know,

00:52:40.084 --> 00:52:43.070
exactly the same as the
acquisition of spoken languages.

00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:46.498
It didn't have to be that way.
It could have been just as

00:52:46.498 --> 00:52:50.175
reasonable to expect that
there'd be an advantage for

00:52:50.175 --> 00:52:53.175
speech over sign.
That sign languages may be

00:52:53.175 --> 00:52:56.773
full-blown languages but they
just take--they're just harder

00:52:56.773 --> 00:53:00.128
to learn because the brain and
the body have adapted for

00:53:00.128 --> 00:53:02.260
speech.
It turns out that this just

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:05.069
isn't the case.
It turns out that sign and--the

00:53:05.069 --> 00:53:09.091
developmental milestones of sign
languages and the developmental

00:53:09.091 --> 00:53:12.730
milestones of spoken languages
are precisely the same.

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:14.530
They start babbling at the same
point.

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:17.640
They start using first words,
first sentences,

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:19.989
first complicated
constructions.

00:53:19.989 --> 00:53:23.385
There seems to be no
interesting difference between

00:53:23.385 --> 00:53:27.256
how the brain comes to acquire
and use the spoken language

00:53:27.256 --> 00:53:31.564
versus a sign language.
Around twelve months of age,

00:53:31.564 --> 00:53:35.099
children start using their
first words.

00:53:35.099 --> 00:53:41.396
These are words for objects and
actions like "dog" and "up" and

00:53:41.396 --> 00:53:44.201
"milk."
They start showing some

00:53:44.201 --> 00:53:47.079
sensitivity to the order of
words.

00:53:47.079 --> 00:53:53.178
So they know that "dog bites
cat" is different from "cat

00:53:53.178 --> 00:53:56.209
bites dog."
Around eighteen months of age,

00:53:56.209 --> 00:53:58.010
they start learning words
faster.

00:53:58.010 --> 00:54:02.895
They start producing little,
miniature sentences like "Want

00:54:02.895 --> 00:54:07.360
cookie" or "Milk spill" and the
function morphemes,

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:10.179
the little words,
"in," "of," "a," "the," and so

00:54:10.179 --> 00:54:12.040
on start to gradually appear.

00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:17.929
Then the--Then there's the bad
news.

00:54:17.929 --> 00:54:22.210
Around seven years of age going
up through puberty,

00:54:22.210 --> 00:54:26.489
the ability to learn language
starts to go away.

00:54:26.489 --> 00:54:31.542
The best work on this has been
done by Elissa Newport and Sam

00:54:31.542 --> 00:54:36.425
Supalla who have studied people
who have been in the United

00:54:36.425 --> 00:54:40.419
States for many,
many years – 30,40 years –

00:54:40.419 --> 00:54:44.500
and seeing how well they have
come to speak English.

00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:47.350
And it turns out the big
determinant of how well you

00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:50.480
speak English as an immigrant
isn't how smart you are.

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:53.238
It's not how many family
members you have when you're

00:54:53.238 --> 00:54:55.460
here.
It's not your motivation.

00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:58.530
It's how old you were when you
started.

00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:02.418
It turns out that if you start
learning a language – a second

00:55:02.418 --> 00:55:06.181
language is where most of the
work's been done – within the

00:55:06.181 --> 00:55:08.690
first few years of life you're
fine.

00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:13.027
You'll speak like a native.
But then it starts getting

00:55:13.027 --> 00:55:16.227
worse and worse.
And once you hit puberty,

00:55:16.227 --> 00:55:20.635
suddenly there's huge variation
in the abilities you have to

00:55:20.635 --> 00:55:22.929
learn language.
It is very rare,

00:55:22.929 --> 00:55:25.363
for instance,
for somebody who has learned

00:55:25.363 --> 00:55:28.389
English past puberty to speak
without an accent.

00:55:28.389 --> 00:55:31.530
An accent is very hard to shake
and it's not just an accent.

00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:35.677
It's also other aspects of
phonology, syntax,

00:55:35.677 --> 00:55:39.569
and morphology.
It's like the part of the brain

00:55:39.569 --> 00:55:44.222
that's responsible for language
learning is only around early in

00:55:44.222 --> 00:55:48.949
development and if you don't get
your language by then it'll just

00:55:48.949 --> 00:55:53.616
run out.
I want to begin next class with

00:55:53.616 --> 00:55:58.400
this question,
the question of animals.

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.030
And that will shut down the
language learning part.

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:10.199
But one thing I'll put up here
is your second reading response.

00:56:10.199 --> 00:56:13.353
So, I'll also put this up on
Wednesday, and by Wednesday you

00:56:13.353 --> 00:56:16.667
might have a bit of a better--be
in a better position to answer

00:56:16.667 --> 00:56:19.335
this question.
But I'll continue with language

00:56:19.335 --> 00:56:22.085
on Wednesday and then we'll also
talk about vision,

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.020
All right.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.450
Good morning.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.700
The subject of today's
lecture is options.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.990
And I think, maybe I'd better
first define what an option

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:20.140
is, before I move to say
anything about them.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.579
Because some of you may not have
encountered them, because

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.840
they're not part of everyday
life for most people, although

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.010
they are, in a sense.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.100
I'll get back to that.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.535
Let me just define
the term here.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:47.920
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.090
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: So
there's two kinds of options.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.040
There's a call and a put, OK?

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:05.440
A call option is an option to
buy something at a specified

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:15.430
price, and the price is called
the ''exercise price'' or

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.660
''strike price.'' Those
are synonyms.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.160
And a put option is the right
to sell something at the

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.290
specified exercise price.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:40.170
And it has another term it has
to be specified, and that's

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.890
the exercise date.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.370
OK.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.030
Options go back thousands
of years.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.230
It must have happened before we
have any recorded records.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.510
If you're thinking of buying
something from someone, but

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.100
you don't want to put up the
money today, you go to some

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.010
lawyer, and say, write
up a contract.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.060
I want to buy an option
to buy this thing.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.530
So, for example, if you are
thinking of building a

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.670
building on land that is owned
now by a farmer, but you're

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.650
not ready to do it.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.030
You may be thinking about it.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.550
You can go to the farmer and
say, I'd like to buy that

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.100
corner of that acre there.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.250
I'd like to have the
right to buy it.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.260
I'll pay you now
for the right.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.690
And you get a lawyer and you
write up a contract.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.190
And that's an option.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.530
You have an option to buy at the
exercise price until the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.900
exercise date.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:06.930
Now, in modern terminology,
we have two kinds,

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.660
American and European.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.570
It doesn't refer to geography,
those two terms. The terms

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.810
refer, instead, to when
you can exercise.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.540
So, the American option is
better than the European

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.420
option for the buyer, because
the American option can be

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.970
exercised at any time until
the exercise date.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.520
Whereas the European option can
be exercised only on the

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.230
exercise date.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.770
But you see the American option
has to be better, or

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.070
not worse than --

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.570
I don't know if it's strictly
better -- but not worse than

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.835
the European option, because
you have more options.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.160
I think, we've defined
what they are.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.149
Do you understand well
enough what they are?

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:11.680
They occur naturally in life.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.380
I remember, Avinash Dixit was
writing about options and he

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.570
said, well, when you're dating
someone and you know the

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.030
person will marry you, you have
an option that you can

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.100
exercise at any time by
agreeing to marry.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.750
Now, one of the theorems in
option theory is, you usually

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.010
don't want to exercise
a call option early.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:44.950
And so, Dixit would say, well,
maybe that's why a lot of

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.220
people have trouble
getting married.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.770
They don't want to exercise
their option early.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.680
What we'll see is that options
have option value.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.690
They give you a choice, and so
there's something there.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.080
When you exercise an option,
that is, when you actually buy

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.140
the thing, or in the case of
a put, sell the thing, then

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.740
you're losing the choice.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.275
So, you've given up something.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.980
Of course, you have to also
exercise eventually, if things

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.765
are going to make sense.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.440
Usually, when we talk about
options, we're talking now

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.720
about options to buy a share
of stock, or 100 shares of

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.010
stock, and that's the
usual example.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.800
But they occur all
over the place.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.550
Let me mention some other
examples of options.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.930
The usual story is
the stock option.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.500
You go to your broker and you
say, I'd like to buy an option

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.790
to buy 100 shares
of Microsoft.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.140
I don't want to buy Microsoft, I
want to buy an option to buy

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.800
Microsoft, which happens to be
cheaper, by the way, usually.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.560
Usually, it costs more money to
actually buy the thing than

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.250
to buy the right to buy the
thing at another price.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.810
We'll get back to that.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.800
But in a sense, let's think
about this, stocks themselves

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:17.210
are options in a sense, with
a zero exercise price.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.730
Maybe, I'll have to get
back and explain, but

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.220
what I mean is --

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:29.130
let me get back and explain
that in a minute.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.530
But let me go ahead to other
examples, mortgages.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.890
An ordinary home mortgage has
an option characteristic to

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:42.690
it, in the sense that, if the
price of your home drops a

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:48.880
lot, you can just walk away from
the mortgage, and say,

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.470
I'm out of here.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.430
It's like not exercising
an option.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.120
It's analogous.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.480
Or I can choose to prepay a
mortgage early, and that's

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.145
like exercising an option.

00:07:00.145 --> 00:07:04.430
So, option pricing gets into
all sorts of things.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.220
OK.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.700
I thought I should say something
about the purposes

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:25.550
of options, before I move on to
try to discuss what their

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.640
properties and pricing are,
which is the main subject of

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.200
this lecture.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:42.200
I can give two different
justifications for options.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.250
Why do we have options?

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.180
Some people cynically think
that options are

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.352
just gambling vehicles.

00:07:49.352 --> 00:07:50.650
It's another way to gamble.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.650
You can go to the casino,
you can play poker,

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.940
or you can buy options.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.440
Well, I think for some people
that's just what it is, the

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.090
volatile risky investments
that can make

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.710
you a lot of money.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:10.890
But I think, they have a basic
purpose, or purposes.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:15.064
First of all, theoretical.

00:08:15.064 --> 00:08:20.360
If we were trying to design the
ideal financial system,

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.610
what would we do?

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:34.179
Some people thought of ideal
economic systems without

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:36.970
reference to finance,
like Karl Marx --

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.750
I come back to him -- the great
communist, who thought

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.410
that we would have an ideal
communist state and there'd be

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:44.760
no financial markets.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.500
When they actually tried it
and they tried to do it, I

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.150
think they gradually realized
that not having any financial

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:59.960
markets makes our
entrepreneurship, our

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.380
management of enterprises,
kind of blind.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.050
We can't see, where we're going

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.500
because there's no prices.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.590
We don't know what anything
is worth.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:13.730
There was an old joke that the
communist countries survived

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.830
only because they had prices
from capitalist

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.530
countries to rely on.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.590
Otherwise, they don't know
anything about values or

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.820
profits, right?

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.070
So, we need prices.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.090
Many people have written about
this, but I mentioned, in

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:42.810
1964, Kenneth Arrow, who is an
economic theorist, wrote a

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:48.290
classic paper, in which he
argued that, unless we have

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:52.940
prices for all states of nature,
there's a sense in

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.270
which the economic system
is inefficient.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.490
You really need the price of
everything, including the

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:03.440
price of some possibility.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:10.240
In a sense, that's what options
are giving you, the

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.710
existence of options
is giving you.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:22.680
So, Steven Ross, who used to
teach here at Yale, a friend

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:31.090
of mine, lives here in New
Haven, in 1976, in The

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.490
Quarterly Journal of Economics,
wrote a classic

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:39.500
paper about options, showing
that, in a sense, they

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.930
complete the state space.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:48.850
They create prices for
everything that affects

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.460
decision-making.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.720
I'm not going to get into the
technicalities of the paper,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.670
but I wanted to start with a
theoretical justification for

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.090
options, so you'll see
why we're doing this.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:01.240
I don't want this to come across
as a lecture, on how

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.690
you can gamble in the
options market.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.660
This is about making things work
right for the economic

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.840
system, improving
human welfare.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.510
But a lot of people
don't get that.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.920
That's why Karl Marx
was so successful.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.400
It seems too abstract.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.530
What does this options
market do for us?

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.160
Let me just go back to the
example I started out with.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.410
You're a construction firm,
and you're thinking of

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.280
building something, a new
supermarket, where people can

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.550
buy their food.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:37.880
And you note that there's a pair
of expressways crossing

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.320
somewhere, and you think, that's
the perfect place to

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.970
build a mega supermarket,
because everyone can

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.100
get there by car.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.320
And there's a lot of land,
I can build a big

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.060
parking lot, perfect.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.390
But before you think further,
you go to buy an option on the

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.700
land, right?

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.080
So, you knock on the door at the
farmhouse, and there's a

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.700
farmer with all these acres, and
you say, I'm thinking of

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.340
building a mega supermarket
here.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.520
I'd like to buy an option
on your farm.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.650
You learn something
at that moment.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.950
You might learn that the farmer
says, I've already sold

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:15.220
an option, so I can't do it.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.670
You could try to talk to the
person I sold it to, and see

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.390
if you can buy it from him.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:23.190
Or the farmer might say, I've
had three other offers, and

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:26.320
I'm raising my price
to some millions

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.750
and millions of dollars.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.850
Then, you have second thoughts
about doing it.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.250
You see what I'm saying,
that the price

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.490
discovery is in there?

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.930
It's making things happen
differently.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.570
You're learning something.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.510
The farmer is learning
something.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:42.440
You are learning something from
the options market, and

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:47.390
ultimately it decides where
that supermarket will go.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:50.880
So, that's the theoretical
purpose of options.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.560
I wanted to talk, also, about a

00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:02.590
behavioral purpose of options.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.850
It's a little fuzzier about the
actual benefits of options

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:15.010
from this standpoint.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:24.350
The behavioral theory of
options says that --

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.720
Very many different aspects
of human behavior tie into

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:36.970
options, but I would say it
has something to do with

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:41.520
attention anomalies
and salience.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.330
Psychologists talk about this,
that people make mistakes very

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:52.180
commonly in what they pay
attention to, what strikes the

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.450
fancy of their imagination.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.390
Salience is something
psychologists also talk about.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:07.290
Salient events are events that
tend to attract attention,

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:08.540
tend to be remembered.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.960
Now, when you think of options,
a lot of options are

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.670
what are called incentive
options, OK?

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:26.450
And when you get your first job,
you may discover this.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.310
They'll give you options
to buy shares in the

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.210
company you work for.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.470
Why do they do that?

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.370
I think it's because of certain
human behavioral

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.430
traits that I mention
here, your

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.260
attention and your salience.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.040
It's not necessarily very
expensive for a company to

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:49.300
give you options to buy shares
in the company, but it puts

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.420
you in a situation, where you
start to pay attention to the

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.870
value of the company.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:57.150
It becomes salient for you, and
you start hoping that the

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.630
price of the company will go up,
because you have options

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.190
to buy it, at a strike price.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:05.560
You hope that the company's
price per share goes above

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.170
your strike price,
because then your

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.340
options are worth something.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.190
They're in the money.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:14.140
So, it may change your
motivation and your morale at

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.680
work, or sense of identity
with the company.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.420
All these sorts of
things figure in.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.140
That's why we have incentive
options.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.020
They can also give you
peace of mind.

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:43.170
Insurance is actually related to
options in the sense that,

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:46.570
when you buy insurance on your
house, it's like buying a put

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.540
option on your house, although
it may be not directly

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.660
connected to the home's
value, right?

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.600
When you buy an insurance policy
in your house, and the

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.880
house burns down, you collect
on the insurance policy.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.310
Well, the price of your
house fell to zero.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:04.510
If you had bought a put option
on the house, it would do the

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:05.940
same thing, right?

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:10.040
You would have an option to
sell it at a high price on

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.160
something that's
now worthless.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:17.020
So, insurance is like options,
and insurance gives

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.910
you peace of mind.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:24.040
So, people think in certain
repetitive patterns, and one

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.080
of them is, that I would like to
not worry about something.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.800
So, I can get peace of mind,
if I have a put option on

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.520
something that I might otherwise
worry about.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.860
All right, maybe that's enough
of an introduction, but I'm

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.230
giving you both theoretical
reasons for options and

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.530
behavioral reasons.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.805
I think of them as basically
inevitable.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:52.490
You may have people advising
you not to bother

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.220
with options markets.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:59.290
That might be right for you, in
a sense, but I think that

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:01.750
they're always going to be with
us, and so it's something

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.000
that we have to understand.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:18.440
I have a newspaper clipping
that I cut out.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.170
I've been teaching this course
for over 20 years, so

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.280
sometimes I don't update
my newspaper clippings.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.210
I have a newspaper clipping from
the options page that I

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:31.850
made in 2002, OK?

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.600
So, that's nine years ago.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.880
But I can't update it anymore,
because newspapers don't print

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.110
option prices anymore.

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:41.260
So, I could go on some
electronic trade account and

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.380
get an updated option page.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:48.250
But why don't we just stick with
The Wall Street Journal?

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:54.080
This is a clipping from The
Wall Street Journal, April

00:17:54.080 --> 00:18:00.770
2002, when they used to have
an options page, OK?

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:02.840
I just picked America Online.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:06.940
I don't know why.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:07.830
It's an interesting company.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.305
You remember America Online,
a web presence?

00:18:10.305 --> 00:18:12.170
It used to be bigger
than it is now.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:21.650
And actually, in 2000, America
Online merged with Time

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.400
Warner, OK?

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.030
So, we actually have
two different rows

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.680
corresponding --

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:36.020
Forget Ace Limited, the second
row says AOL.TW.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:40.350
That's America Online Time
Warner, the merged company,

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:44.460
and then below that, they have
America Online itself.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:53.310
These were options that were
issued before the merger, and

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:59.510
they apparently are being
exercised in terms of the same

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.720
AOL Time Warner stock.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.700
AOL, by the way, was spun off
by Time Warner last year, so

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.440
they had a divorce.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.170
They were married in 2000.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.930
They were divorced in 2010.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:19.240
So, you can get back to
it, AOL options, now.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:24.160
So, anyway, it shows
the price of the

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.000
share at $21.85 a share.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:35.610
So, you take any of these rows,
and it shows you, for

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:43.580
various strike prices, what
the options prices are.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.185
So, let's go to the top row.

00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:57.620
A strike price of $20.00,
expiring in May of 2002, which

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.270
is one month into the future.

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:03.310
Remember, it's April
2002 right now.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:06.300
The volume is the number of
options that were traded

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:12.880
yesterday, and the $2.55 up
there is the price of a call

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:18.570
option, the last price of the
option to be traded yesterday.

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:19.825
This is the morning paper.

00:20:19.825 --> 00:20:21.928
It's reporting on yesterday
morning's prices [correction:

00:20:21.928 --> 00:20:24.320
yesterday's prices
at closing].

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.720
And then, there's put
options traded.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.880
A lot more puts were
traded on that day.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:35.100
There were 2000 put options
traded on that day in April

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:42.920
2002, and the last price of
the put option was $0.85.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:51.320
For $0.85, you could buy the
right to sell a share of AOL

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:56.590
Time Warner at $20.00, OK?

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:59.170
And similarly, you could
buy the right to buy it

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.392
at $20.00 for $2.55.

00:21:02.392 --> 00:21:04.990
So, these are different
strike prices and

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:06.290
different exercise dates.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:11.490
This one --

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.020
I can reach it --

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:17.390
is to buy it at, if it's a call,
$25.00 strike price,

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:21.240
costs you $0.45 to buy that.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:26.080
But if you want to buy a put,
it costs you $3.60.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.820
And we want to try to understand
these prices, OK?

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:33.020
That's the purpose here.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:44.900
So, let me say one thing more
before I get into that.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.840
This is presented for the
potential buyers, OK?

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.550
These are options prices.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:53.190
There's also the seller
of the option.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:56.330
They're called the writer
of the option.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:59.450
I gave you an example before,
when I talked about the farmer

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:01.990
and you thinking of building
a supermarket.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:05.410
So, you are the buyer of the
option and the farmer is the

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:06.700
writer of the option.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.780
The farmer is writing
the option to you.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.930
You could also consider buying
an option from someone else,

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:20.835
who's not even the
farmer, right?

00:22:20.835 --> 00:22:23.140
It could be some speculator.

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.470
You don't have to go
to the farmer.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:27.780
You can go to somebody else and
say, I'd like to buy an

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.230
option on that farm
over there.

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:32.810
And someone would say, sure,
I'll sell you an option on it.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:33.640
And then I'm good for it.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.070
That means I have to go and buy
it at whatever price from

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.870
the farmer.

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:38.450
Maybe that's not such
a good idea.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:41.750
He might sense my urgency
to buy it.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.710
But if it's a stock, someone
can write an option, who

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:46.170
doesn't even own the stock.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:50.055
And so, that's called a naked
seller of an option, OK?

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:54.620
Neither the buyer nor the
seller ever have to

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:55.450
trade in the stock.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.390
This is a market by itself.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.870
You could buy an option, and
then you could sell it as an

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.280
option without ever
exercising it.

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:11.660
The writer could write an
option, and then buy an option

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.360
to cancel it out later, and
then, essentially, get out of

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.470
that contract.

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:19.690
So, the option becomes a market
of its own, where

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:23.390
prices of options start to
look like an independent

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:26.475
market, and this is called
a derivatives market.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:36.560
There's an underlying stock
price, but this is a

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.250
derivative of the stock price.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:49.080
The first options exchange was
the Chicago Board Options

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:55.000
Exchange, which came
in in 1973.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.570
Before that, options were
traded, but they were traded

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:02.150
through brokers and they didn't
have the same presence.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:05.640
You didn't see all these options
prices in newspapers.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.840
It's when they opened the market
for options, that the

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.150
options trading became
a big thing.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:16.040
So, options markets are
relatively new, if you

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.990
consider '73 new.

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.090
You weren't born then.

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:23.570
It's not really that long ago.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:28.300
Since then, there are many more
options exchanges, but

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.100
CBOE is the first one.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.010
They're now all over
the world.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:37.860
And we also have options
on futures.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.750
And so, futures exchanges now
routinely trade options on

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.560
their futures contracts.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:49.800
So, that's a derivative on a
derivative, but it's done.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:59.710
So, let me draw a simple picture
of option pricing.

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:11.410
So, this is the stock price
and this is the

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:19.900
option price, OK?

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.610
And I'm going to mark here,
the exercise price.

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:37.620
Let's look at the exercise
date, the last day.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:43.110
The option is about to expire,
and this is your last chance

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.090
to buy the stock.

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:46.070
Then, it doesn't matter, on
that day, whether it's an

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:47.610
American or European option.

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.300
They're both the same
on the last day.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.230
What is the price of the option
as a function of the

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:55.060
stock price?

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:59.460
Well, if the stock price is less
than the exercise price,

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.870
the option is worthless,
right?

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.970
It will not be exercised.

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:09.010
You won't exercise an option
to buy it for more than you

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.290
could just buy it on
the market, right?

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:12.780
STUDENT: You have
to say ''call''.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.080
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
Did I not say call?

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.670
Yes, I'll put it up here.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.630
We're talking about
call options.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.560
Thank you.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:30.370
But if it's above the exercise
price, this is a 45 degree

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:34.570
angle, that's a line with the
slope of one, the option

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.870
prices rises with the stock.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:41.270
In fact, it just equals the
stock price minus the exercise

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:42.990
price, right?

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:47.170
So, this region, we say, is
''out of the money.'' The

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:52.569
option is out of the money,
when its prices

00:26:52.569 --> 00:26:54.300
[clarification: the stock
price], for a call, is less

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.860
than the exercise price.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.490
Here, it's ''in the money.''
I'll put it up

00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:59.740
here, in the money.

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:05.050
And then, on the exercise date,
it will always equal the

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:08.410
stock price minus the
exercise price.

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:10.230
So, it's very simple.

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:13.970
Now, one confusion that's often
made: I gave the example

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:18.200
of building a shopping center
or a supermarket on a farm.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.330
Now, someone might think that
you buy an option on it, so

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:24.650
that you can think about it and
make up your mind later.

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:27.030
Well, in a sense, you
could do that.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:31.070
But the thing is, you will
exercise the option whether or

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:34.870
not you build the shopping mall
or this supermarket, if

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:36.810
it's in the money, right?

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:39.960
Suppose, you changed your mind,
and I don't want to

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.360
build the supermarket.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:45.330
But I'm sitting on an option
that I bought, to buy his land

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.900
for a price, which is less than
the market price for it.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.410
Of course, I'll buy it.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:52.660
So, you're going to buy it,
whether you build the shopping

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.030
center or not.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:57.660
You always exercise the option,
if it's in the money

00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:58.400
on the last day.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.610
That's the assumption.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.590
I mean you could not, I suppose,
if you like the

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:03.610
farmer and you want
to be a nice guy.

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:04.630
I don't know.

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:11.730
But usually, what it is, it's a
non-linear relation between

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.940
the stock price and
the derivative.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:20.020
So, the derivative is a broken
straight line function of the

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:20.890
stock price.

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:24.290
Whereas all the portfolios
we construct, are linear.

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:25.160
They're straight lines.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.790
They don't have a
break in them.

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:30.834
So, the option creates a break
in the function of

00:28:30.834 --> 00:28:33.130
the stock price --

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:35.670
and this is why Ross emphasized
that options price

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:37.880
something very different,
that's not priced

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.060
in the regular --

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:45.380
no portfolio shows you this
broken straight line relation.

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.530
Now, I wanted to then
talk about a put.

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:49.050
What is a put?

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:51.640
Let me erase, where it says
in and out of the money.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.550
I'll show it.

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:59.290
I'll do this with a dashed line,
so that you'll see which

00:28:59.290 --> 00:28:59.650
one is which --

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.470
I'm leaving the call line up.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:04.215
With a put, a put is out
of the money up here --

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.620
I can't really show
it too well --

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:16.340
if the stock price is above the
exercise price, because

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.660
you're selling now.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:23.150
And it's in the money, if the
stock price is less than the

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:24.280
exercise price --

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.670
I didn't draw that very well.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:28.820
That's supposed to be
a 45 degree line.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:32.825
That's a 45 degree angle, has
a slope of minus one, right?

00:29:32.825 --> 00:29:34.075
That's on the exercise date.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.730
Now, it's interesting that
there's a pretty simple

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:48.900
pattern here between
puts and calls.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:56.160
What if I buy one call and I
short one put, all right?

00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:00.070
Or write a put, writing a put
and shorting a put are the

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:03.140
same thing, all right?

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.730
What does that portfolio
look like?

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:15.700
Well, if I put that portfolio
together, I want to have plus

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:20.860
one call minus one
put, all right?

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:28.500
My portfolio relation to the
stock price is going to look

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.290
like that, right?

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:30.540
It's just going to be
a straight line.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:39.710
So, the value of my portfolio
is equal to the stock price

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:41.350
minus the exercise price.

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.220
Simple as that.

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:48.290
And my portfolio can be negative
now, because I've

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:49.110
shorted something.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:51.410
I can have a negative
portfolio value.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:58.520
That's very simple,
can you see that?

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:04.415
This leads us to the put-call
parity equation.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.260
If a put minus a call
[correction: a call minus a

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:13.840
put] is the same thing as the
stock minus the exercise

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.480
price, then the prices should
add up too, right?

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.600
So, put-call parity --

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.120
there's different ways
of writing this.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:46.490
But it says that the stock price
equals the call price

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:58.080
minus put price plus exercise
price on the last day, on the

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.270
exercise day, right?

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:00.520
It's simple.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.160
This is put-call parity
on the exercise date.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:16.420
Now, let's think about some day
before the exercise date.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:17.700
Well, you know this is
going to happen on

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.210
the exercise date.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:23.320
So, at any date before the
exercise date, the same thing

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.810
should hold, except that
we've got to make

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:30.200
this the present value.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:34.890
Present discounted value
of the exercise price.

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:38.580
And also we have to add in, in
case there is any dividends

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:42.060
paid between now and the
exercise date, plus the

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:49.150
present discounted value of
dividends paid between now and

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:50.570
the exercise date.

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.145
Because the stock gets
that, and the option

00:32:52.145 --> 00:32:54.480
holders don't, OK?

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:58.790
So, that's called the put-call
parity relation.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:01.780
And now I can cross out
''exercise date.'' This should

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:05.600
hold on all dates.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.640
Because if it didn't hold, there
would be an arbitrage,

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.430
or profit opportunity.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:17.990
So, it should hold on this
page, except for minor

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:21.620
failures to hold.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.710
It should hold approximately
on this page.

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:25.750
And let me give you
one example.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:28.260
See, if it holds.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:32.390
Let's consider the one
that I can reach.

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:35.790
OK, oh, this is the
stock price.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:36.970
So, what do I have?

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:43.890
The biggest thing here is the
strike price, exercise price.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:45.140
So, we want to do --

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:56.530
we'll do this line, $25.00 plus
$0.45 minus $3.50, and

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:58.040
I'm assuming there's
no dividend paid

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.152
between now and May.

00:34:01.152 --> 00:34:04.030
It comes out very
close to $21.85.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.449
I can't do the arithmetic
in my head.

00:34:06.449 --> 00:34:10.540
It may not hold exactly, because
these prices may not

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:13.050
all have been quoted at exactly
the same time, and

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:18.330
there's some transactional
costs that limit this.

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:19.210
Do you see that?

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:22.755
So, because of the put-call
parity relation, The Wall

00:34:22.755 --> 00:34:26.570
Street Journal didn't even
bother to put the put prices

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:29.989
in, because you can get
one from the other.

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:35.480
But they do put them in, just
because people like to see

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:42.139
them, and some people might be
trying to profit from the

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:45.110
put-call parity arbitrage.

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:48.970
But for our purposes, we only
have to do call pricing.

00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:51.870
Once we've got call pricing,
we've got put prices.

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:54.950
So, I just use the put-call
parity relation and I get put

00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:56.440
price prices.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.930
So, now let's think about
how you would price puts

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:02.220
[correction: calls].

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:08.220
The price of a put
[correction: call],

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:11.050
we know what it is on the
exercise date, right?

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:13.700
I'm going to forget
the dashed lines.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.760
There's no dashed lines
here anymore.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:18.132
We're just talking about
call prices.

00:35:18.132 --> 00:35:28.060
All right, so this shows
the price of a put on

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:29.850
the last day --

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:32.430
of a call on the last day.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:35.390
Now, what about an
earlier day?

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.530
[clarification: The following
argument about price bounds

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:35.630
solely applies to
call options.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:35.790
It also abstracts from dividend
payments of the

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:37.040
underlying stock.]

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:43.870
Well, the price of a call can
never be negative, right?

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:46.680
So, the call price has to
be above this line.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:55.090
It can never be worth less than
the stock price minus the

00:35:55.090 --> 00:36:02.480
exercise price, even before
the exercise date.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.180
And also, it can't be
worth more than

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.430
the stock price itself.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:07.440
I'll draw a 45 degree line
from the origin.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.310
That's supposed to be
parallels of that.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:22.060
It's obvious that the call price
has to be above this

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:25.910
broken straight line, but
not too far above it.

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:28.990
Above this broken straight line,
representing the price

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:31.670
as a function of the stock
price on the last day.

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:35.420
And the closer you get to the
last day, the closer the

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.770
options price will get
to that curve.

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:44.830
So, on some day before the
exercise date, the call option

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:49.910
price will probably look
something like that, right?

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:55.850
It's above the broken straight
line because of option value.

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:59.390
So, think it this way, suppose
an option is out of

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:01.780
the money today --

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:03.405
well, you can see out of
the money options.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.840
For a call, this is out
of the money, right?

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:14.700
Because its stock price is
$21.85, but I've got an option

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:16.960
to buy it for $25.00.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.540
All right, that's going to be
worthless, unless the option

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:19.830
price [correction: stock price]

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:23.840
goes up before it expires.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:26.410
So, it's only worth something,
because there's a chance that

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:30.830
it will be worth something
on the exercise date.

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.070
And what are people paying
for that chance?

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:35.980
$0.45, not much.

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.390
Why are they paying so little?

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:42.070
Well, you can say intuitively,
it's because it's pretty far.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:47.510
$21.85 is pretty far from
$25.00, and this option only

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:48.550
has a month to go.

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:51.460
What's the chance that the price
will go up that much?

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.680
Well, there is a chance,
but it's not that big.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.530
So, I'm only willing
to pay $0.45 to buy

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.800
an option like that.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.150
So, we're somewhere like
here on that row

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:03.400
that I've shown you.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.860
The reason you don't want to
exercise an option early is,

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:16.460
because, if you exercise it
early, your value drops down

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:19.640
to the broken straight
line, right?

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:23.630
It's always worth more than
the broken straight line

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:26.620
indicates before the
exercise date.

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:30.190
So, if you want to get your
money out, sell the option.

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:32.100
Don't exercise it early.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:35.300
So, that's why the distinction
between European and American

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:40.450
options is not as big or as
important as you might think,

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:40.660
at first. [clarification:
American call options should

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:40.710
indeed not be exercised early.

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.780
However, there are circumstances
under which it

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.030
is optimal to exercise an
American put option early.]

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:53.180
So, we can just price European
options, and then we can infer

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:56.400
what other options would
be, what put

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.650
options would be worth.

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:10.390
Let's now talk about
pricing of options.

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:14.490
And the main pricing equation
that we're going to use is the

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:17.640
Black-Scholes Option
Pricing equation.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.930
But, before that, I wanted to
just give you a simple story

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:23.550
of options pricing, just
to give you some

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:26.930
idea, how it works.

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:29.150
And then I'm going to not
actually derive the

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:34.580
Black-Scholes formula, but I'm
going to show it to you.

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:41.880
I'm going to tell you a simple
story, just to give some

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:48.490
intuitive feel about the
pricing of options.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:55.050
And to simplify the story, I'm
going to tell a story about a

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:58.920
world, in which there's only
two possible prices for the

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.800
underlying stock.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.930
That makes it binomial.

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:06.820
There's only two things that can
happen, and you can either

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:10.310
be high or low, all right?

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:12.020
So, let me get my notation.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:19.110
I'm going to use S as the
stock price, all right?

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:26.910
I'm going to assume that the
stock price, that's today --

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.950
this is also a simple world in
that there's only one day.

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:34.380
The option expires tomorrow.

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.940
There's only one more price
we're going to see.

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:40.440
So, the stock is either going
to go up or down.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:47.260
So, u is equal to one plus the
fraction that it goes up.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:50.390
u stands for up.

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:55.060
And d is down, is one plus
the fraction down.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:05.230
So, that means that stock price
either becomes Su, which

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:10.950
means it goes up by a fraction,
multiple u, or it is

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:15.620
Sd, which means it goes
down by a multiple d.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.250
And that's all we know, OK?

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:22.890
But now we have a call option:
Call C the price of the call.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.590
We're going to try to
derive what that is.

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:33.670
But we know, from our broken
straight line analysis, we

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:39.910
know what C sub u is, the price
if the stock goes up.

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:46.880
And we know what C sub d is,
it's the price if down, OK?

00:41:46.880 --> 00:42:02.240
So, suppose the option has
exercise price E, all right.

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.160
Do you understand this world?

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.820
Simple story.

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:10.870
Now, what I want to do is
consider a portfolio of both

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:13.947
the stock and the option,
that is riskless.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:24.980
I'm going to buy a number of
options equal to H. H is the

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:39.350
hedge ratio, which is the number
of shares purchased per

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:40.120
option sold.

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:44.740
So, I'm going to sell a call
option to hedge the stock

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:49.340
price, to reduce the risk
of the stock price, OK?

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:57.720
And so, hedge ratio is shares
purchased over options.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.950
Each option is to buy
one share, OK?

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:04.950
So, what I'm going to
do is, write one

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:08.180
call and buy H shares.

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:11.940
So, let me erase this and
start over again.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:22.075
I'm on my way to deriving the
options price for you --

00:43:22.075 --> 00:43:23.470
a little bit of math.

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:46.780
So, I'm going to write one call
and buy H shares, OK.

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:53.200
If the stock goes up, if we
discover we're in an up world

00:43:53.200 --> 00:44:00.600
next period, my portfolio
is worth uHS

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:04.810
minus C sub u, right?

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:08.370
Because the share price goes
from S to uS, and I've got H

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:15.010
shares, and I've written
a call, so I have

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:18.890
to pay C sub u.

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:28.250
If it's down, then my
portfolio is dHS

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:34.310
minus C sub d, OK?

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:37.050
This is simple enough?

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:40.450
Now, what I want to do is
eliminate all risk.

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:44.980
So, that means I want to choose
H, so that these two

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.560
numbers are the same.

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.550
And if I do that, I've
got a riskless

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:51.170
investment, all right?

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:55.860
So, set these equal
to each other.

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:59.230
And that implies something about
H. We can drive what H

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:04.010
is, if I just put these two
equal to each other and solve

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:15.110
for H. And I get H equals C sub
u minus C sub d, all over

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:21.990
u minus d times S, OK?

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:25.640
So, I've been able to put
together a portfolio of the

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:30.260
stock and the option
that has zero risk.

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:34.410
If I do this, if I hold this
amount of shares in my

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:38.770
portfolio, I've got a
riskless portfolio.

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:43.840
So, that means that the riskless
portfolio has to earn

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.440
the riskless rate, right?

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.752
It's the same thing as a
riskless rate [correction:

00:45:48.752 --> 00:45:49.970
same thing as a riskless
investment], so it has to earn

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:51.130
that [clarification: earn
the riskless rate].

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:53.940
If I can erase this now,
I'm almost there,

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:57.000
through option pricing.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:03.935
The option pricing then says
that, since I'm derived what H

00:46:03.935 --> 00:46:10.040
is, the portfolio has to be
worth one plus the interest

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:20.140
rate times what I put in, which
is HS minus C. And that

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:26.520
has to equal the value of the
portfolio at the end, which is

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:35.840
either uHS minus C sub u,
or dHS minus C sub d,

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.930
the same thing, OK?

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:45.560
So, I've already derived what
H is, and I substituted into

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:54.900
that, and I solved for C. So,
substitute H in and solve for

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:59.880
C, and we get the
call price, OK?

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:06.230
It's a little bit complicated,
but the call option price has

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:17.310
to equal one plus r minus d,
all over u minus d, times C

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:26.540
sub u over one plus r, plus u
minus one minus r, all over u

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:33.410
minus d, times C sub d
all over one plus r.

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:36.870
And I'll put a box around that
because that's our option

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:41.590
price formula, OK?

00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:45.030
Did you follow all that?

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:47.070
This is derived --

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:50.920
This option price formula
was derived from a

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.810
no arbitrage condition.

00:47:57.910 --> 00:48:04.120
Arbitrage, in finance, means
riskless profit opportunity.

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:08.550
And the no arbitrage condition
says, it's never possible to

00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:13.270
make more than the riskless rate
risklessly, all right?

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:16.330
If I could, suppose I had some
way -- suppose the riskless

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:22.870
rate is 5%, and I can make 6%
risklessly, then I will borrow

00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:27.050
at the riskless rate and put
it into the 6% opportunity.

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:29.400
And I'll do that until
kingdom come.

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:31.150
There's no limit to how
much I'll do that.

00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:32.400
I'll do it forever.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:40.090
It's too much of a profit
opportunity to ever happen.

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:43.390
One of the most powerful
insights of theoretical

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:47.190
finance is, that the
no arbitrage

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:49.100
condition should hold.

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.260
It's like saying, there are no
$10 bills on the pavement.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:55.190
When you walk down the street
and you see a $10 bill lying

00:48:55.190 --> 00:49:00.030
there on the street, your first
thought ought to be, are

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:02.530
my eyes deceiving me?

00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:04.500
Because somebody else
would have picked it

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:05.430
up if it were there.

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:06.780
How can it be there?

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:08.490
I once actually had
that experience.

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:11.180
I was walking down the
street in New York.

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:13.000
It was actually a $5 bill.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.850
It was just lying there
in the street.

00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:18.530
And so, I reached down to pick
it up, and then, suddenly, it

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:19.610
disappeared.

00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:22.400
And it was people on one of the
stoops of one of these New

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:25.820
York townhouses playing
a game.

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:28.250
They'd tied a string
to a $5 bill.

00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:31.240
And they would leave it on the
street, and watch people reach

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:33.320
for it, and they'd
snatch it away.

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:36.690
That's the only time in my life
I ever saw a $5 bill on

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:37.980
the pavement.

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:40.860
And so, it's a pretty good
assumption that, if you see

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:43.040
one, it isn't real.

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.390
And that's all this is saying,
that if the option price

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:50.150
didn't follow this formula,
something would be wrong.

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:52.190
And so, it had better followed
this formula.

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:58.160
Now, that is the basic
core option theory.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:02.460
Now, the interesting thing about
this theory is, I didn't

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:07.190
use the probability of up and
the probability of down.

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:10.330
So somebody says, wait a minute,
my whole intuition

00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:13.820
about options is: I'd buy
an option, because it

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:16.330
might be in the money.

00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:20.150
When I was just describing this
here, this is $0.45, I

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:22.110
said, that's not much,
because it probably

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:26.240
won't exceed $25.00.

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:29.880
It's so far below it.

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:34.100
So, it seems like the options
should really be fundamentally

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:39.370
tied to the probability
of success.

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:40.790
But it's not here at all.

00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:42.070
There's no probability in it.

00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:43.600
You saw me derive it.

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.840
Was I tricking you?

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.310
Well, I wasn't.

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:49.280
I don't play tricks.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:50.740
This is absolutely right.

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:54.130
You don't need to know the
probability that it's in the

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:58.210
money to price an option,
because you can price it out

00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:02.930
of pure no-arbitrage
conditions.

00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:08.050
So, that leads me then to the
famous formula for options

00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:12.840
pricing, the Black-Scholes
Option Pricing Formula, which

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:14.420
looks completely different
from that.

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:20.490
But it's a kindred, because it
relies on the same theory.

00:51:20.490 --> 00:51:22.080
And there it is.

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:29.000
This was derived in the late
70's, or maybe the early 70's,

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:35.190
by Fisher Black, who was at MIT
at the time, I think, but

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:45.130
later went to Goldman Sachs, and
Myron Scholes, who is now

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:49.900
in San Francisco,
doing very well.

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:55.115
I see him at our Chicago
Mercantile Exchange meetings.

00:51:58.280 --> 00:51:59.695
Fisher Black passed away.

00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:06.220
It doesn't have the probability
that the option is

00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:09.460
in the money, either, but it
looks totally different from

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:12.795
the formula that I
wrote over there.

00:52:12.795 --> 00:52:20.623
The call price is equal to the
share price, S, times N of d

00:52:20.623 --> 00:52:27.830
sub 1, where d sub 1 is this
equation, minus e to the minus

00:52:27.830 --> 00:52:32.380
r, the interest rate, times time
to maturity, T, times the

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:37.230
exercise price times N of d sub
2, where this is d sub 2.

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:39.780
And the N function is the
cumulative normal

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.676
distribution function.

00:52:41.676 --> 00:52:46.730
I'm not going to derive all
that, because it involves

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:49.650
what's called the calculus
of variations.

00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:52.190
I don't think most of you
have learned that.

00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:58.360
In ordinary calculus, we have
what's called differentials,

00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:01.380
dy, dx, et cetera.

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:04.750
Those are fixed numbers
in ordinary calculus.

00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:09.620
In the mid 20th century,
mathematicians, notably the

00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:14.900
Japanese mathematician Ito,
developed a random version of

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:19.430
calculus, where dx and dy
are random variables.

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:22.130
That's called the stochastic
calculus.

00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:25.320
But I'm not going to use that.

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:26.730
I'm not going to derive this.

00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:34.580
But you can see how to price an
option using Black-Scholes.

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:39.460
But Black-Scholes is derived,
again, by the no-arbitrage

00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:42.210
condition and it doesn't
have the probability.

00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:45.180
Oh, the other variable that's
significant here is sigma,

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:49.290
which is the standard deviation
of the change in the

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:51.050
stock price.

00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:53.930
So, once we put that in, someone
could say, well,

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:58.410
probabilities are getting in
through the back door, because

00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:02.450
this is really a probability
weighted sum of the changes in

00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:04.510
stock prices.

00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:08.340
Well, probability is not really
in here at all, but

00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:11.340
maybe there's something like
standard deviation, even in

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:12.850
this equation.

00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:15.410
Because we had C sub u and C sub
d, and that would give you

00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:16.276
some sense of the variability.

00:54:16.276 --> 00:54:16.332
[clarification: In the binomial
asset pricing model,

00:54:16.332 --> 00:54:16.428
u and d give you some sense
of the variability of the

00:54:16.428 --> 00:54:16.492
underlying stock price,
analogous to sigma in the

00:54:16.492 --> 00:54:17.742
Black-Scholes formula.]

00:54:20.770 --> 00:54:22.530
I'm going to leave this
equation just

00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:25.270
for you to look at.

00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:31.080
But what it does do is, it shows
the option price as a

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:33.350
nice curvilinear relationship,
just like the

00:54:33.350 --> 00:54:36.020
one I drew by hand.

00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:44.250
Which then, as time to exercise
goes down, as we get

00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:48.800
close to the exercise date,
that curve eventually

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:51.090
coincides with the broken
straight line.

00:54:53.630 --> 00:55:01.060
Now, I wanted to tell you about
implied volatility.

00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:04.950
This equation can be used
either of two ways.

00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:10.920
The most normal way to do it,
to use this equation, is to

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.500
get the price that you think
is the right price for an

00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:16.650
option, to decide whether I'm
paying too much or too little

00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:18.770
for an option.

00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:22.850
So with this formula, I can
plug in all the numbers.

00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:26.620
To use this formula, I have to
know what the stock price is.

00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:29.985
That's S. I have to know what
the exercise price is.

00:55:29.985 --> 00:55:32.180
And I have to know what the
time to maturity --

00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:35.900
these are all specified by the
stock price and the contract.

00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:38.110
I have to know with the
interest rate is.

00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:42.190
And if I also have some idea of
the standard deviation of

00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:46.940
the change in the stock
price, then I can

00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:49.700
get an option price.

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:52.080
But I can also turn it around.

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:54.880
If I already know what the
option is selling for in the

00:55:54.880 --> 00:56:01.340
market, I can infer what the
implied sigma is, right?

00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:02.600
Because all the other
numbers in the

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:04.770
Black-Scholes formula are clear.

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:06.200
They're in the newspaper,
or they're

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:08.210
in the option contract.

00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:12.030
There's this one hard to pin
down variable, what is the

00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:15.070
variability of the
stock price?

00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:18.950
And so, what people often use
the Black-Scholes formula to

00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:24.780
is, to invert it and calculate
the implied volatility of

00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:26.090
stock prices.

00:56:26.090 --> 00:56:31.110
So, when call option prices are
high, why are they high

00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:33.150
relative to other times?

00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:35.240
Well, it must be that
people think --

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:37.700
I'm going back to the old
interpretation, that the

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:40.530
probability of exercise
is high, right?

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:43.510
If an out of the money call is
valuable, it must be people

00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:46.200
think that sigma is high.

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:50.140
So, let's actually solve
for how high that is.

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:53.190
I can't actually solve
this equation.

00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:54.740
I have to do it numerically.

00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:59.020
But I can calculate, for any
call price, given the stock

00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:02.830
price, exercise price, time to
maturity, and interest rate.

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:08.590
I can calculate what volatility
would imply that

00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:10.100
stock price.

00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:16.820
And so, that's where we are
with Black-Scholes.

00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:24.670
So, implied volatility is the
options market's opinion as to

00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:30.170
how variable the stock market
will be between now and the

00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:31.420
exercise date.

00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:38.850
So, one thing we can do is
compute implied volatility.

00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:43.430
And I have that here
on this chart here.

00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:49.950
What I have here, from 1986 to
the present, with the blue

00:57:49.950 --> 00:58:00.570
line, is the VIX, V-I-X , which
is computed now by the

00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:03.660
Chicago Board Options
Exchange.

00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:06.220
When the CBOE was founded,
they didn't

00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:07.800
know how to do this.

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:11.290
Black and Scholes invented their
equation in response to

00:58:11.290 --> 00:58:13.370
the founding of the CBOE.

00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:18.760
And now, the CBOE publishes
the VIX.

00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:21.010
And that's where I got this,
off their website cboe.com.

00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:29.140
And so, they have computed,
based on the front month, the

00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:35.520
near options, what the options
market thought the volatility

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:37.100
of the stock market was.

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:39.590
That's the blue line.

00:58:39.590 --> 00:58:43.450
And you can see, it had a lot
of changes over time.

00:58:43.450 --> 00:58:47.020
That means that options prices
were revealing something about

00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:49.820
the volatility of the
stock market.

00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:51.890
Now, the blue line is
from the Chicago

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:53.930
Board Options Exchange.

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:59.190
What I did, and I calculated
this myself, the orange line

00:58:59.190 --> 00:59:05.360
is the standard deviation of
actual stock prices over the

00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:11.460
preceding year, of monthly
changes, annualized.

00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:13.640
That's actual volatility.

00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:17.490
But it's actual past
volatility.

00:59:17.490 --> 00:59:19.380
Let's make it clear,
what this is.

00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:26.080
What the VIX is, is the sigma in
the Black-Scholes equation.

00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:32.890
But it is, in effect, the
market's expected standard

00:59:32.890 --> 00:59:34.620
deviation of stock prices.

00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:38.610
And to get it more precise, it's
the standard deviation of

00:59:38.610 --> 00:59:45.310
the S&amp;P 500 Stock Price Index
for one month, multiplied by

00:59:45.310 --> 00:59:49.110
the square root of 12, because
they want to annualize it.

00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:50.360
It's for the next month.

00:59:57.250 --> 00:59:59.420
Why do they multiply it by
the square root of 12?

00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:02.050
Well, that's because, remember
the square root rule.

01:00:02.050 --> 01:00:04.520
These stock prices are
essentially independent of

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:07.880
each other month to month, so
the standard deviation of the

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:12.240
sum of 12 months is going to be
a square root of 12 times a

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:15.460
standard deviation
of one month.

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.730
And this is in percent
per year.

01:00:17.730 --> 01:00:19.130
So, that means that the implied

01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:25.950
volatility in 1986 was 20%.

01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:31.840
And then, it shot way up to
60%, unimaginably quick.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:36.260
That might be the record high,
I can't quite tell from here.

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:38.660
Remember, I told you the
story of the 1987

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:40.290
stock market crash?

01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:43.260
The stock market fell
over 22% in one day.

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:47.020
Well, actually, on the S&amp;P,
it was only 20%, but

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:48.210
a lot in one day.

01:00:48.210 --> 01:00:50.800
It really spooked the
options markets.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:54.420
So, the call option prices went
way up, thinking that

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:56.190
there's some big volatility
here.

01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:57.570
We don't know, which
way it'll be next.

01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:59.790
Maybe it will be up, maybe
it will be down.

01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:04.080
It pushed the implied
volatility, temporarily, up to

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.400
a huge level.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.050
It came right back down.

01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:12.610
My actual volatility, I
calculated this for each day

01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:14.290
as the volatility of
the market over

01:01:14.290 --> 01:01:16.070
the preceding year.

01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:21.130
Well, since I put October 1987
in my formula, I got a jump up

01:01:21.130 --> 01:01:26.110
in actual volatility, but not
at all as big as the options

01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:26.880
market did.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:31.220
See, the option market is
looking ahead and I have no

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:35.850
way to look ahead, other than to
look at the options market.

01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:39.810
So, to get my actual volatility,
I was obliged to

01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:44.280
look at volatility in the past,
and it went up because

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:47.350
of the 1987 volatility,
but not so much.

01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:50.490
So what this means is,
that, in 1987,

01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:52.320
people really panicked.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:54.380
They thought something
is really going on

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.310
in the stock market.

01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:58.440
They didn't know what it was and
they were really worried,

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.400
and that's why we see this spike
in implied volatility.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:06.290
There's a couple other spikes
that I've noted, the Asian

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:10.610
financial crisis occurred
in the mid 1990's.

01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:16.900
Now, that is something that was
primarily Asian, but it

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.720
got people anxious over
here as well.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:25.350
You know, Korea, Taiwan,
Indonesia, Hong Kong, these

01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:27.790
countries had huge turmoil.

01:02:27.790 --> 01:02:31.810
But it came over here in the
form of a sudden spike in

01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:33.360
expected volatility.

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:36.130
People thought, things could
really happen here.

01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:40.500
So, all the option prices
got more valuable.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:41.770
And then there's this spike.

01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:43.800
This is the one that
you remember.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.850
This is the financial crisis
that occurred in

01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:48.610
the last few years.

01:02:48.610 --> 01:02:55.070
Notably, it peaks in the fall
of 2008, which was the real

01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:58.690
crisis, when Lehman Brothers
collapsed, and it created a

01:02:58.690 --> 01:03:01.090
crisis all over the world.

01:03:01.090 --> 01:03:05.510
There was a sharp and sudden
terrible event.

01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:10.410
And you can see, that actual
volatility shot up to the

01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:14.120
highest since 1986, as
well, at that time.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:20.320
So, implied volatility, you
can't ask easily from this

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.620
chart, whether it was
right or wrong.

01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:27.260
People were responding to the
information, and the response

01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:29.205
felt its way into
options prices.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.520
There's no way to find out, ex
post, whether they were right

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.070
to be worried about that.

01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:44.500
But they were worried about
these events, and it led to

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.110
big jumps in options prices.

01:03:47.110 --> 01:03:53.880
Now, I wanted to show the same
chart going back even further,

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:57.370
but I can't do it with options
prices, because I can show

01:03:57.370 --> 01:04:01.710
volatility earlier, but I can't
show implied volatility

01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:06.470
before around 1986, because the
options markets weren't

01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:07.180
developed yet.

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:14.660
But I computed an actual S&amp;P
Composite volatility.

01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:17.680
Well, in my chart title,
I said S&amp;P 500.

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:21.160
The Standard and Poor's 500
Stock Price Index technically

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:27.400
starts in 1957, but I've got
what they call the Standard

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:32.415
and Poor's Composite
back to 1871.

01:04:32.415 --> 01:04:40.650
And so, these are the actual
moving standard deviations of

01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:46.720
stock prices, all the way back
to the beginnings of the stock

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.840
market in the U.S. Well, not the
very beginnings, but the

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:53.780
earliest that we can get
consistent data for, on a

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.030
monthly basis.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.660
And you can see, this
goes back further

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:02.650
than the other chart.

01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:06.860
You can see that the actual
volatility of stock prices,

01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:11.340
except for one big event, called
the Great Depression of

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:16.240
the 1930s, has been remarkably
stable, right?

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:21.180
The volatility in the late
20th century, early 21st

01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:26.360
century, is just about exactly
the same as the volatility in

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.040
the 19th century.

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:32.070
It's interesting, how stable
these patterns are.

01:05:32.070 --> 01:05:36.250
There was this one really
anomalous event that just

01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:41.350
sticks out, and that is
the Great Depression.

01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:45.260
1929 precedes it, it's
somewhere in here.

01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:49.710
But somehow people got really
rattled by the 1929 stock

01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:51.590
market crash.

01:05:51.590 --> 01:05:54.930
And not just in the U.S. This is
U.S. data, but you'll find

01:05:54.930 --> 01:05:57.080
this all over the world.

01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:02.430
It led to a full decade of
tremendous stock market

01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:09.200
volatility around the world,
that has never

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.850
been repeated since.

01:06:11.850 --> 01:06:17.640
The recent financial crisis
has the second highest

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:21.060
volatility after the
Great Depression.

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.350
This isn't long ago.

01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:25.640
This is well within
your memories.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:33.580
Just a few years ago, we had
another huge impact on

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:36.150
volatility.

01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:38.950
And as you saw on the preceding
slide, it had a big

01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:42.110
impact on implied volatility
as well.

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:48.880
So, I think that we had a near
miss of another depression.

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:52.010
It's really scary what happened
in this crisis.

01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:59.770
Also shown here is the first
oil crisis, which we talked

01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:04.800
about, in 1974, when oil prices
had been locked into a

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.540
pattern because of the
stabilization done by the

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:08.980
Texas Railroad Commission.

01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:13.820
But when that broke, and OPEC
first flexed its muscles, it

01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:16.900
created a sense of
new reality.

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:21.590
And it caused fear, and it
caused a big spike up in the

01:07:21.590 --> 01:07:26.130
volatility of the stock market,
but not quite as big

01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:27.670
as the current financial
crisis.

01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:30.340
So, this is an interesting
chart to me.

01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:37.770
A lot of things I learned from
this chart, and let me

01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:40.910
conclude with some thoughts
about this.

01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:44.000
But what I learned from this
chart is that, somehow,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.170
financial markets are very
stable for a long time.

01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:50.550
So, it would seem like it
wouldn't be that much of an

01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:51.340
extrapolation --

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:53.096
when are you people
going to retire?

01:07:53.096 --> 01:07:56.390
Did you pick a retirement
date yet?

01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:59.470
Well, let's say a half
century from now, ok?

01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:05.720
So, that would be 2060?

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:08.819
So, you're going to retire
out here, all right?

01:08:08.819 --> 01:08:10.740
Your whole life is in here.

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:12.870
What do you think volatility
is going to do

01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:14.689
over that whole period?

01:08:14.689 --> 01:08:16.850
Well, judging from the
plot, it's probably

01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:18.270
pretty similar, right?

01:08:18.270 --> 01:08:20.399
That's not much more history
compared to what

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:21.579
we've already seen.

01:08:21.579 --> 01:08:24.260
It's probably just going
to keep doing this.

01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:26.649
But there's this risk
of something like

01:08:26.649 --> 01:08:28.680
this happening again.

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:38.540
And we saw a near miss here, but
this plot encourages me to

01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:44.090
think that maybe outliers, or
fat tails, or black swan

01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:50.050
events, are the big disruptors
of economic theory.

01:08:50.050 --> 01:08:55.470
Black-Scholes is not a
black swan theory.

01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:59.939
It assumes normality of
distributions, and so, it's

01:08:59.939 --> 01:09:01.320
not always reliable.

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:11.149
So, this leads me to think that
option pricing theory --

01:09:11.149 --> 01:09:13.569
I presented a theory.

01:09:13.569 --> 01:09:18.250
The Black-Scholes theory is a
very elegant and very useful

01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:22.819
tool, especially useful when
things behave normally.

01:09:22.819 --> 01:09:25.439
But I think, one always has to
keep in the back of one's

01:09:25.439 --> 01:09:33.750
mind, the risk of sudden major
changes like we've seen here.

01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:35.710
So, let me just you
give us some final

01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:38.090
thoughts about options.

01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:39.850
I launched this lecture
by saying,

01:09:39.850 --> 01:09:42.040
they're very important.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:51.640
And they affect our lives
in many ways.

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:55.520
I've been trying to campaign
for the expansion of our

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:58.770
financial markets.

01:09:58.770 --> 01:10:03.050
Working with my colleagues and
the Chicago Mercantile

01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:08.260
Exchange, we launched options,
in 2006, on single-family

01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:10.640
homes in the United States.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.580
We were hoping that people
would buy put options to

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:17.770
protect themselves against home
price declines, but the

01:10:17.770 --> 01:10:21.570
market never took off.

01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:25.270
We have, since, seen huge human
suffering because of the

01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:27.360
failure of people to
protect themselves

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.170
against home price declines.

01:10:31.890 --> 01:10:36.700
There were various noises that
were made by people in power,

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:39.840
that suggested that maybe
something could be done.

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:43.190
President Obama proposed
something called Home Price

01:10:43.190 --> 01:10:46.750
Protection Program, and it
sounded like an option, a put

01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:48.160
option program.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.800
But, actually, it was a much
more subtle program than that.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:54.910
It was a program to incentivize
mortgage

01:10:54.910 --> 01:11:00.280
originators to do workouts on
mortgages, if the mortgages

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.350
would default --

01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:03.880
if home prices were to fall.

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.430
And nothing really
happened with it.

01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:09.510
The President can't get things
started, either, not always.

01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:12.070
I've been proposing that
mortgages should have put

01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:14.510
options on the house
attached to them.

01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:17.410
When you buy a house, get
a mortgage, you should

01:11:17.410 --> 01:11:19.010
automatically get
a put option.

01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:21.270
I've got a new paper on that.

01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:23.000
But these are kind
of futuristic

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.250
things at the moment.

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:30.340
I'm just saying this at the end,
just to try to impress on

01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:35.450
you, what I think is the real
importance of options markets.

01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:39.910
People don't manage risks well
in the present world.

01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:42.960
Having options or insurance-like
contracts of an

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:46.910
expanded nature will help people
manage their risks

01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:51.770
better, and it will make
for a better world.

01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:53.830
OK.

01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:56.190
I'll see you on Monday.

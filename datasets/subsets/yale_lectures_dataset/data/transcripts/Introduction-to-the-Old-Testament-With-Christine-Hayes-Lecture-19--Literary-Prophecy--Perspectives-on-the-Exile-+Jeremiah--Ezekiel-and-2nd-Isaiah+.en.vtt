00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.845
Professor Christine
Hayes: I'm going to go ahead

00:00:03.845 --> 00:00:06.768
now and get started with some
sixth-century material

00:00:06.768 --> 00:00:09.462
which--prophetic
literature--which confronts the

00:00:09.462 --> 00:00:13.360
issues that were raised by the
final destruction of Jerusalem.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.922
What was the meaning of this
event and how could it be

00:00:16.922 --> 00:00:20.620
reconciled with the concept of
Israel as God's elect?

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.554
How could such tremendous evil
and suffering be reconciled with

00:00:23.554 --> 00:00:24.880
the nature of God himself?
 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.637
This is going to be a question
that will return in the next

00:00:27.637 --> 00:00:30.347
lecture when we look at the
wisdom literature and the Book

00:00:30.347 --> 00:00:32.621
of Job,
and some other texts as well as

00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:35.050
we proceed through the rest of
the course.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.273
In classical terms,
if God is God,

00:00:37.273 --> 00:00:41.250
then he's not good if all these
terrible things happened,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.328
and if God is good then he
mustn't be all powerful because

00:00:44.328 --> 00:00:46.110
he failed to prevent this evil.
 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.710
That tends to be the dilemma,
the way it's phrased.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.049
Now, Ezekiel was a priest and
he was deported in the first

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:55.483
deportation.
You remember there was a

00:00:55.483 --> 00:00:59.313
deportation of exiles in 597,
and then the final siege and

00:00:59.313 --> 00:01:02.539
destruction and deportation of
exiles in 587.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.439
Ezekiel was among the deportees
of 597.

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.814
He was therefore,
in exile in Babylon during the

00:01:08.814 --> 00:01:12.620
final destruction and the fall
of Jerusalem in 587,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.091
but his priestly background and
his priestly interests are

00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:16.739
clearly reflected in his
prophecies.

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:20.707
He accuses the Israelites of
failing to observe cultic laws,

00:01:20.707 --> 00:01:23.599
ritual laws,
and his promises for the future

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:26.825
and his vision of a restoration,
we will see,

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:30.921
center around a new temple and
a restored Jerusalem and temple

00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:33.083
complex.
There's a striking

00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:37.590
correspondence between Ezekiel
and the priestly sources in

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.991
terms of language and theme,
particularly H,

00:01:40.991 --> 00:01:42.810
the Holiness code.
 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.352
Now, the prophecies in Ezekiel,
conveniently and unlike many of

00:01:46.352 --> 00:01:49.208
the other prophetic books,
actually follow a fairly

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:50.580
chronological order.
 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.088
So the first section of the
book consists of prophecies that

00:01:54.088 --> 00:01:56.230
were before the final
destruction,

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.242
between 597 and 587,
and then beginning in 33,

00:01:59.242 --> 00:02:03.260
it seems we have prophecies
that followed the destruction.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.965
He gets the report of the
destruction, and then we see how

00:02:06.965 --> 00:02:09.240
his tone and his message
changes.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.718
So in those first 24 chapters
where you have prophecies that

00:02:12.718 --> 00:02:15.440
are delivered in Babylon,
before the destruction,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.292
we have three chapters that are
devoted to his call and his

00:02:18.292 --> 00:02:19.620
commission as a prophet.
 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.360
We see his inaugural vision.
 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.314
I'll come back and talk about
that in a minute as well as many

00:02:24.314 --> 00:02:25.669
other visions and symbols.
 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:28.046
Then you have,
from chapters 4 to 24,

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:31.150
oracles that are condemning
Judah and Israel.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.789
There are some interesting
elements within this.

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:37.368
We have the depiction of the
kavod (which represents

00:02:37.368 --> 00:02:40.061
God) departing.
We'll talk about that text in a

00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:41.351
minute.
We also have,

00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:44.539
in chapter 18,
a very interesting emphasis on

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.220
individual responsibility for
sin.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.460
We'll come back and touch on
that as well.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.183
Chapters 25 to 32 contain
oracles against foreign nations

00:02:53.183 --> 00:02:55.910
just as we have in Jeremiah and
Isaiah.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.340
Throughout, Ezekiel refers to
these nations as the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.156
uncircumcised.
The tone here is vengeful and

00:03:02.156 --> 00:03:04.731
very gloating,
and these oracles have exerted

00:03:04.731 --> 00:03:07.539
a very strong influence on the
New Testament,

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:10.349
particularly the Book of
Revelation.

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.955
After 587, Ezekiel prophesied
and those prophecies are

00:03:14.955 --> 00:03:20.689
contained in the latter part of
his book from chapters 33 to 48.

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.815
So in 33 we hear of the fall of
Jerusalem, and then after that,

00:03:24.815 --> 00:03:27.810
oracles of promise and hope for
the future.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.580
The last chapters,
from chapter 40 to 48 are

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.479
visions: Ezekiel's visions of
the restoration,

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:37.280
his vision of a rebuilt Temple
and a rebuilt Jerusalem.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.746
So the book opens with a
narrative account of Ezekiel's

00:03:40.746 --> 00:03:44.468
call in about 593 or so in a
Jewish community that's on the

00:03:44.468 --> 00:03:47.539
River Chebar,
which is a large irrigation

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:50.400
canal off of the Euphrates in
Babylon.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.046
And this is the first time that
we hear of a call of a prophet

00:03:54.046 --> 00:03:55.780
outside the land of Israel.
 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.259
It's a remarkable vision.
 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:00.900
Like many of the visions in the
Book of Ezekiel it has a sort of

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.500
surrealistic,
almost hallucinatory quality.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.863
The vision itself is very
reminiscent of descriptions of

00:04:06.863 --> 00:04:08.819
Baal, the Canaanite storm god.
 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.629
So there's a stormy wind and a
huge cloud, and a flashing fire.

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.659
God is riding on a kind of
throne chariot.

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.560
He's enthroned above four
magnificent creatures.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.881
Each of these has a human body
and then four faces:

00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:24.471
the face of a human,
the face of a lion,

00:04:24.471 --> 00:04:27.660
the face of an ox,
and the face of an eagle.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.105
There are four huge wheels
under this throned-chariot,

00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:34.680
and they are said to gleam like
beryl beneath a vast and

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.060
awe-inspiring expanse or dome,
which gleams like crystal.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.716
Above that is the semblance of
a throne that is like sapphire,

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:48.067
and on the throne was the
semblance of a human form that's

00:04:48.067 --> 00:04:52.570
gleaming like amber,
and its fire encased in a

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.310
frame, which is radiant all
about.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.328
So this kavod,
this cloud that contains or

00:04:59.328 --> 00:05:03.226
hides the fire that is Yahweh's
presence--That is also the term

00:05:03.226 --> 00:05:06.328
that's used in the Torah,
in Exodus and the priestly

00:05:06.328 --> 00:05:09.180
sources to describe the presence
of God among His people,

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.990
this fire that's encased in a
cloud, the kavod.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.484
In Exodus 24 we read that this
kavod had settled on

00:05:15.484 --> 00:05:18.060
Mount Sinai representing God's
presence.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.234
In Exodus 40,
this cloud covers the tent of

00:05:21.234 --> 00:05:23.563
meeting;
it fills the tabernacle,

00:05:23.563 --> 00:05:26.972
so when Ezekiel sees it now he
says, that it "was the

00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:30.839
appearance of the semblance of
the Presence of the Lord.

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:33.946
When I beheld it,
I flung myself down on my face

00:05:33.946 --> 00:05:36.920
and I heard the voice of someone
speaking."

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.460
Notice this language;
it was the "semblance of the

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.899
appearance of the Presence."
 

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:44.802
Ezekiel wants to emphasize the
transcendent nature of the

00:05:44.802 --> 00:05:46.811
deity.
He's having a vision of

00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:50.029
something which cannot in fact
be seen or perceived,

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:53.310
which is a kind of paradox of
all of his visions.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.775
The prophet's humanity is
emphasized in contrast to this

00:05:56.775 --> 00:05:59.736
transcendent divinity,
and that's something that

00:05:59.736 --> 00:06:01.689
happens throughout Ezekiel.
 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:05.980
He emphasizes his humanity with
this phrase "Son of Man," ben

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.670
adam.
Son of Man;

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.925
it simply is the Hebrew term
for a mortal being as opposed to

00:06:10.925 --> 00:06:13.177
divine being.
Son of Man simply means a

00:06:13.177 --> 00:06:14.269
human, a morta.
 

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:16.779
Ben adam,
one who is like Adam.

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:20.659
Now, the call of Ezekiel is
reminiscent of the call of

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:22.269
Jeremiah and Isaiah.
 

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:25.265
He is sent to a nation of
rebels, rebels who will not be

00:06:25.265 --> 00:06:26.300
listening to him.
 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.448
His commission is symbolized by
a scroll that's handed to him,

00:06:30.448 --> 00:06:34.325
and we hear at the end of
chapter 2 that inscribed on this

00:06:34.325 --> 00:06:37.589
scroll are lamentations and
dirges and woes,

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:40.646
and he's commanded to eat of
this scroll and then go to speak

00:06:40.646 --> 00:06:41.920
to the House of Israel.
 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.300
So he swallows this scroll and
all of its dreadful contents.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.553
It tastes to him as sweet as
honey and then his task is

00:06:49.553 --> 00:06:51.680
spelled out in chapter 3.
 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.739
He is to be a watchman,
one who gives warning of

00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:57.930
danger, and people will either
heed him or not,

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.707
but each one of them is
ultimately responsible for his

00:07:01.707 --> 00:07:03.985
or her own fate.
In a vision,

00:07:03.985 --> 00:07:07.552
in chapter 8,
an angel transports Ezekiel to

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:10.870
Jerusalem and into the temple
courts,

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.873
and there he sees and gives a
very vivid description of the

00:07:14.873 --> 00:07:16.529
shocking abominations.
 

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:21.170
These are represented as
justifying or explaining the

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.543
destruction of the city and
these descriptions are

00:07:25.543 --> 00:07:30.452
characterized by more than the
usual amount of prophetic

00:07:30.452 --> 00:07:33.795
hyperbole.
As he watches the slaughter and

00:07:33.795 --> 00:07:37.131
the destruction that's going on
there, Ezekiel sees the

00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:40.380
kavod,
that is the presence of Yahweh,

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.590
arise from the Temple and move
to the east.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:48.054
Chapter 10:18-19:
...the Presence of the

00:07:48.054 --> 00:07:51.042
LORD left the platform of the
House and stopped above the

00:07:51.042 --> 00:07:53.006
cherubs.
And I saw the cherubs lift

00:07:53.006 --> 00:07:56.076
their wings and rise from the
earth, with the wheels beside

00:07:56.076 --> 00:07:58.483
them as they departed;
and they stopped at the

00:07:58.483 --> 00:08:00.980
entrance of the eastern gate of
the House of the Lord,

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.760
with the Presence of the God of
Israel above them.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.674
In chapter 11:23-25:
…The Presence of the

00:08:07.674 --> 00:08:10.495
LORD ascended from the midst of
the city and stood on the hill

00:08:10.495 --> 00:08:11.420
east of the city.
 

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.591
A spirit carried me away and
brought me in a vision by the

00:08:14.591 --> 00:08:17.430
spirit of God to the exiled
community in Chaldea.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.931
[So now he's back to Babylon.]
Then the vision that I had seen

00:08:20.931 --> 00:08:24.489
left me, and I told the exiles
all the things that the Lord had

00:08:24.489 --> 00:08:27.482
shown me.
So this image draws on Ancient

00:08:27.482 --> 00:08:31.098
Near Eastern traditions of gods
abandoning their cities in

00:08:31.098 --> 00:08:34.460
anger, leaving them to
destruction by another god.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.702
The primary difference here is
that God, rather than another

00:08:37.702 --> 00:08:40.340
god, is himself also bringing
the destruction.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.160
Moreover, God doesn't retire to
the heavens.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.230
He doesn't abandon his people.
 

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:50.404
He doesn't remain behind with
those left in Judah,

00:08:50.404 --> 00:08:52.620
but he moves into exile.
 

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.890
In the book of Ezekiel those
left behind are guilty.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:58.017
God does not stay with them;
God moves east with the

00:08:58.017 --> 00:08:59.399
righteous exiles.
 

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:03.748
Then at the end of the Book of
Ezekiel, we're going to see a

00:09:03.748 --> 00:09:07.750
vision of a restored Temple,
this happens in Ezekiel 43,

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.728
and here Ezekiel will see the
kavod returning from the

00:09:11.728 --> 00:09:14.551
east and back to the temple,
…And there,

00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:16.580
coming from the east with a
roar like the roar of mighty

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.247
waters,
was the Presence of the God of

00:09:18.247 --> 00:09:20.410
Israel, and the earth was lit up
by His presence.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.178
…
The Presence of the LORD

00:09:22.178 --> 00:09:24.320
entered the temple by the gate
that faced eastward.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.174
…
…and lo, the Presence of the

00:09:26.174 --> 00:09:29.399
LORD filled the Temple.
That was 43:1-6.

00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:33.009
So just as the presence,
the Divine presence,

00:09:33.009 --> 00:09:37.522
went eastward with the exiles
so it will return with the

00:09:37.522 --> 00:09:41.049
re-establishment of Israel in
her home.

00:09:41.049 --> 00:09:45.436
What is significant here is the
idea that God is not linked to a

00:09:45.436 --> 00:09:48.639
particular place but to a
particular people.

00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:51.571
And the implication then is
that God is with His people,

00:09:51.571 --> 00:09:53.169
even when they are in exile.
 

00:09:53.169 --> 00:09:56.611
So Ezekiel preached a message
of doom and judgment like his

00:09:56.611 --> 00:09:59.460
prophetic predecessors and his
contemporaries,

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.648
but his condemnations tend to
emphasize the people's idolatry

00:10:02.648 --> 00:10:05.678
and their moral impurity and
this of course makes sense of

00:10:05.678 --> 00:10:07.059
his priestly heritage.
 

00:10:07.059 --> 00:10:11.309
His denunciations of Jerusalem
are among the most lurid and

00:10:11.309 --> 00:10:14.240
violent that you'll find in the
Bible.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.098
Again, these prophesies were
likely delivered between the two

00:10:18.098 --> 00:10:20.864
deportations,
between 597 and then the final

00:10:20.864 --> 00:10:23.629
destruction and deportation in
587,586.

00:10:23.629 --> 00:10:27.779
And Ezekiel warns that
Jerusalem will fall deservedly.

00:10:27.779 --> 00:10:31.600
He says that rebellion against
Babylon would be treason against

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.106
God.
He employs all kinds of very

00:10:34.106 --> 00:10:37.769
vivid metaphors to describe
Israel's situation.

00:10:37.769 --> 00:10:41.226
Jerusalem, he says,
is Sodom's sister except even

00:10:41.226 --> 00:10:43.822
more vile.
Jerusalem is a "vine" but a

00:10:43.822 --> 00:10:45.490
wild one or a burned one.
 

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.220
She produces nothing of use.
 

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:51.036
Purity language is employed
metaphorically throughout

00:10:51.036 --> 00:10:53.266
Ezekiel.
Jerusalem has been utterly

00:10:53.266 --> 00:10:56.891
defiled and there are all sorts
of images that inspire revulsion

00:10:56.891 --> 00:10:58.100
in these chapters.
 

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.009
So destruction is the only
possible remedy.

00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:04.919
There are metaphors of sexual
promiscuity throughout the book.

00:11:04.919 --> 00:11:08.786
God's destruction of Israel is
figured as the abuse doled out

00:11:08.786 --> 00:11:11.879
by an insanely jealous husband
who is violent,

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:14.762
and the images are disturbing,
they're haunting,

00:11:14.762 --> 00:11:16.480
they're quite nightmarish.
 

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.744
Ezekiel also engages in various
dramatic signs--prophetic signs

00:11:20.744 --> 00:11:23.220
or actions--to convey his
message.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.559
It's something that we've seen
in some of the other prophets,

00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:29.176
but his are so bizarre and so
extreme sometimes,

00:11:29.176 --> 00:11:31.179
that he was accused of
insanity.

00:11:31.179 --> 00:11:35.192
He cooks his food over a fire
of human excrement as a symbol

00:11:35.192 --> 00:11:39.477
of the fact that those besieged
by Nebuchadnezzar will be forced

00:11:39.477 --> 00:11:41.110
to eat unclean food.
 

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:44.490
He doesn't mourn when his wife
dies in order to illustrate the

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:47.650
fact that Yahweh will not mourn
the loss of His temple.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:51.773
He binds himself in ropes;
he lies on his left side 390

00:11:51.773 --> 00:11:56.070
days to symbolize the 390 years
of exile of Israel,

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:59.070
and then he lies on his right
side for 40 days to symbolize

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:02.110
the length of Judah's captivity,
which he says will be 40years.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:05.373
Neither of these terms of
captivity turn out to be

00:12:05.373 --> 00:12:07.630
correct.
Finally, he shaves his beard

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.926
and his hair and he burns a
third of it, he strikes a third

00:12:10.926 --> 00:12:13.841
of it with his sword,
and he scatters a third of it

00:12:13.841 --> 00:12:16.951
to the winds.
He just keeps a few hairs bound

00:12:16.951 --> 00:12:19.364
up in his robe.
This is to symbolize the

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:22.500
destruction of a third of the
people by pestilence and famine,

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.839
a third of the people by
violence, and the exile of a

00:12:25.839 --> 00:12:30.793
third to Babylon;
only a few will God allow to

00:12:30.793 --> 00:12:34.211
escape.
Ezekiel makes it clear that

00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:37.870
those who ignore the warnings
are doomed.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.603
Those who heed will be spared,
and in this,

00:12:40.603 --> 00:12:43.987
he sounds the theme of
individual responsibility that

00:12:43.987 --> 00:12:46.330
is so characteristic of Ezekiel.
 

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.892
I want you to listen to the
following passage and compare it

00:12:49.892 --> 00:12:52.884
to, or think about,
other verses or terms in the

00:12:52.884 --> 00:12:56.639
Torah that you've studied that
may relate to the same topic.

00:12:56.639 --> 00:13:01.029
How is he modifying those
earlier ideas?

00:13:01.029 --> 00:13:04.299
This is all from chapter 18,
various verses throughout:

00:13:04.299 --> 00:13:07.511
The word of the Lord came
to me: What do you mean by

00:13:07.511 --> 00:13:10.159
quoting this proverb upon the
soil of Israel,

00:13:10.159 --> 00:13:13.582
"Parents eat sour grapes and
their children's teeth are

00:13:13.582 --> 00:13:15.706
blunted"?
As I live--declares the Lord

00:13:15.706 --> 00:13:18.560
GOD--this proverb shall no
longer be current among you in

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.620
Israel.
Consider, all lives are Mine;

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.529
the life of the parent and the
life of the child are both Mine.

00:13:24.529 --> 00:13:26.550
The person who sins,
only he shall die.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.084
…
A child shall not share the

00:13:29.084 --> 00:13:31.680
burden of a parent's guilt,
nor shall a parent share the

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.097
burden of a child's guilt;
the righteousness of the

00:13:34.097 --> 00:13:36.848
righteous shall be accounted to
him alone, and the wickedness of

00:13:36.848 --> 00:13:38.769
the wicked shall be account to
him alone.

00:13:38.769 --> 00:13:41.836
Moreover, if the wicked one
repents of all the sins that he

00:13:41.836 --> 00:13:45.168
committed and keeps all My laws
and does what is just and right,

00:13:45.168 --> 00:13:46.950
he shall live;
he shall not die.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.427
…
Is it My desire that a wicked

00:13:49.427 --> 00:13:51.559
person shall die?--says the Lord
GOD.

00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:54.929
It is rather that he shall turn
back from his ways and live.

00:13:54.929 --> 00:13:57.459
So, too, if a righteous person
turns away from his

00:13:57.459 --> 00:14:00.028
righteousness and does wrong,
practicing the very

00:14:00.028 --> 00:14:02.323
abominations that the wicked
person practiced,

00:14:02.323 --> 00:14:04.742
shall he live?
None of the righteous deeds

00:14:04.742 --> 00:14:08.115
that he did shall be remembered;
because of the treachery he has

00:14:08.115 --> 00:14:10.828
practiced and the sins he has
committed--because of these,

00:14:10.828 --> 00:14:12.549
he shall die.
…

00:14:12.549 --> 00:14:15.947
Be assured, O House of Israel,
I will judge each one of you

00:14:15.947 --> 00:14:18.759
according to his ways --declares
the LORD GOD.

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:21.519
Repent and turn back from all
your transgressions;

00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:24.450
let them not be a stumbling
block of guilt for you.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.844
Cast away all the
transgressions by which you have

00:14:26.844 --> 00:14:29.629
offended, and get yourselves a
new heart and a new spirit,

00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:31.779
that you may not die,
O House of Israel.

00:14:31.779 --> 00:14:35.192
For it is not My desire that
anyone shall die--declares the

00:14:35.192 --> 00:14:37.274
Lord GOD.
Repent, therefore,

00:14:37.274 --> 00:14:40.444
and live!"
It's an important Torah idea

00:14:40.444 --> 00:14:43.620
that Ezekiel is rejecting or
contradicting here.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.524
And that's the Torah principle
of collective or even

00:14:46.524 --> 00:14:48.289
intergenerational punishment.
 

00:14:48.289 --> 00:14:50.938
It's found most famously in the
Second Commandment,

00:14:50.938 --> 00:14:53.797
the declaration that God
punishes children for the sins

00:14:53.797 --> 00:14:56.340
of their fathers unto the fourth
generation.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.611
Now, we need to note that we're
talking about divine justice

00:14:59.611 --> 00:15:01.220
here and not human justice.
 

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.385
As we saw in our study of
biblical law in the sphere of

00:15:04.385 --> 00:15:07.434
human justice,
only the guilty are punished in

00:15:07.434 --> 00:15:11.227
Israelite law.
You don't have literal

00:15:11.227 --> 00:15:13.966
punishment.
Someone kills someone's son,

00:15:13.966 --> 00:15:16.192
then their son is put to
death--that idea is

00:15:16.192 --> 00:15:17.750
rejected in biblical law.
 

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.049
But God operates according to a
different principle--the

00:15:21.049 --> 00:15:23.509
principle of collective
responsibility.

00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:26.461
And that principle is
understood in the early sources

00:15:26.461 --> 00:15:27.539
quite positively.
 

00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:31.372
That the sins of the father's
are visited upon the children is

00:15:31.372 --> 00:15:33.320
an expression of God's mercy.
 

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.861
Exodus 34:6 and 7 describe God
as merciful and gracious,

00:15:37.861 --> 00:15:42.898
slow to anger and abounding in
steadfast love and faithfulness

00:15:42.898 --> 00:15:46.424
and thus tolerating sin,
though not completely clearing

00:15:46.424 --> 00:15:48.871
the guilty.
As a mercy he spreads out the

00:15:48.871 --> 00:15:51.779
punishment over three or four
generations.

00:15:51.779 --> 00:15:55.769
So this notion is tied up with
the aspect of God's mercy.

00:15:55.769 --> 00:15:59.392
But evidently there are some
who found this idea unjust and

00:15:59.392 --> 00:16:02.890
other biblical passages try to
bring a different sense of

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:06.178
justice to this picture,
and they emphasize that the

00:16:06.178 --> 00:16:09.370
third and fourth generations
themselves must be wicked.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.740
That seems to be the case in
Exodus 20:5.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.611
The Book of Chronicles,
which is a rewrite of the

00:16:15.611 --> 00:16:18.663
historical material,
the historical narrative in the

00:16:18.663 --> 00:16:21.533
Book of Kings,
rewrites that material in a

00:16:21.533 --> 00:16:25.186
manner that never explains a
catastrophe on the basis of

00:16:25.186 --> 00:16:29.170
guilt incurred by someone other
than the one experiencing the

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.156
catastrophe.
In other words,

00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:34.523
it rejects the Deuteronomistic
historian's device of delayed

00:16:34.523 --> 00:16:37.320
punishment which you'll remember
we discussed.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.588
It changes the narrative
account so that no one suffers

00:16:40.588 --> 00:16:43.009
for a crime committed by someone
else.

00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:46.777
It isn't the sin of an earlier
generation that's finally

00:16:46.777 --> 00:16:50.750
visited upon a grandson or a
king of a later generation.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:55.158
So it seems that after 586,
or certainly in Ezekiel's case,

00:16:55.158 --> 00:16:59.870
some accepted the idea that the
nation was suffering because of

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:03.670
the accumulated guilt of
previous generations,

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.000
notably the Deuteronomist.
 

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.185
But for others like Ezekiel,
the idea of accumulated guilt

00:17:09.185 --> 00:17:13.444
and intergenerational punishment
seemed to lose some of its

00:17:13.444 --> 00:17:17.144
explanatory power,
perhaps because the destruction

00:17:17.144 --> 00:17:20.642
and the exile seemed
devastatingly severe punishments

00:17:20.642 --> 00:17:23.400
that didn't fit the individual
crimes.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.296
So Ezekiel is one who rejects
the doctrine of collective

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:30.980
responsibility in the operation
of divine justice.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.354
In chapter 18,
he responds to the idea of

00:17:33.354 --> 00:17:37.035
suffering for the sins of one's
ancestors by declaring that God

00:17:37.035 --> 00:17:39.470
isn't going to work that way
anymore.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:42.259
God will no longer punish
people collectively.

00:17:42.259 --> 00:17:44.289
Each one will be judged
individually.

00:17:44.289 --> 00:17:47.883
Only the sinner will be
punished--and that's a major

00:17:47.883 --> 00:17:51.898
departure from Exodus 34 and
even from the contemporaneous

00:17:51.898 --> 00:17:53.660
Deuteronomistic view.
 

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.840
At this point,
I think, we would do well to

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.930
remind ourselves of the nature
of the biblical text.

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.619
In the opening lecture,
I asked you to set aside

00:18:03.619 --> 00:18:06.480
certain presuppositions about
the biblical text.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.070
One of them is that it is a
uniform or unified text with a

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:11.960
single doctrine or theology.
 

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.440
I asked you to remember that
the Bible isn't a book;

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.291
it's a library.
It's a library of works that

00:18:17.291 --> 00:18:20.062
originate in vastly differently
historical periods,

00:18:20.062 --> 00:18:22.390
vastly different historical
situations.

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:25.849
It responds to a variety of
shifting needs and events,

00:18:25.849 --> 00:18:29.244
and reflects a range of
perceptions about God and his

00:18:29.244 --> 00:18:31.789
relation to creation and to
Israel.

00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:34.448
It isn't a book of theology,
that is to say,

00:18:34.448 --> 00:18:37.724
rational argumentation in
support of certain doctrines

00:18:37.724 --> 00:18:40.441
about God.
And it most certainly doesn't

00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:44.080
speak with a single voice on
points of theology or matters

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.230
that are of traditional concern
to the discipline of theology.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.970
Doctrine isn't its concern.
 

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:55.068
Understanding and making sense
of the historical odyssey of the

00:18:55.068 --> 00:18:59.099
nation of Israel in covenant
with God--that is its concern.

00:18:59.099 --> 00:19:02.598
So we're going to find many
different interpretations of the

00:19:02.598 --> 00:19:05.385
meaning of that history,
the nature of that God,

00:19:05.385 --> 00:19:07.579
and the meaning of that
covenant.

00:19:07.579 --> 00:19:10.709
And certainly there are some
basic points of agreement,

00:19:10.709 --> 00:19:14.301
but even some of the most basic
points of agreement do not pass

00:19:14.301 --> 00:19:16.039
without some contestation.
 

00:19:16.039 --> 00:19:19.085
So for example,
the basic point that humans are

00:19:19.085 --> 00:19:20.410
free moral agents.
 

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:23.491
This seems to be clearly
assumed throughout most of the

00:19:23.491 --> 00:19:25.259
books of this little library.
 

00:19:25.259 --> 00:19:28.209
But there are some isolated
episodes that would appear to

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:30.580
contradict even that most basic
assumption.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.250
God hardens Pharaoh's heart.
 

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.303
God seals the people's ears
sometimes so that they will not

00:19:35.303 --> 00:19:38.198
hear the message of the
prophets, or will not understand

00:19:38.198 --> 00:19:39.619
them until a later day.
 

00:19:39.619 --> 00:19:42.692
To be sure, there are only a
few of these contradictory

00:19:42.692 --> 00:19:44.400
passages, but they do exist.
 

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.129
And so here we find also a
major shift in the exilic

00:19:48.129 --> 00:19:52.444
period, away from the tendency
to see divine justice working

00:19:52.444 --> 00:19:56.248
through collective or
intergenerational punishment to

00:19:56.248 --> 00:20:00.490
the idea of the individual's
culpability before God.

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:04.010
I shouldn't say a shift away;
we see arising a dialectic.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:05.430
This isn't a linear progression.
 

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:07.953
These are different ideas
coming out at different times

00:20:07.953 --> 00:20:10.009
and receiving emphasis at
different times.

00:20:10.009 --> 00:20:14.096
But this kind of polyphony
didn't impinge upon the

00:20:14.096 --> 00:20:18.849
authority of the Hebrew Bible
for the nation of Israel,

00:20:18.849 --> 00:20:23.269
because the Bible's authority
doesn't arise from some supposed

00:20:23.269 --> 00:20:25.369
consistency or univocality.
 

00:20:25.369 --> 00:20:29.572
That's a modern notion and it's
based on Hellenistic ideals of

00:20:29.572 --> 00:20:30.950
truth as singular.
 

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:33.819
Western culture,
influenced by Greek

00:20:33.819 --> 00:20:37.920
philosophical traditions,
defines truth in monistic

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.359
terms.
Only that which contains no

00:20:40.359 --> 00:20:43.420
contradiction is true and only
that which is true is

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.625
authoritative.
Those notions are somewhat

00:20:46.625 --> 00:20:50.240
alien to the ancient
non-Hellenized world.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.859
The Bible doesn't strive to
present philosophical truth.

00:20:53.859 --> 00:20:57.566
It presents the best efforts of
sages and prophets,

00:20:57.566 --> 00:21:02.026
and scribes and visionaries,
to respond to and to explain

00:21:02.026 --> 00:21:06.259
the crises of the nation over a
period of centuries.

00:21:06.259 --> 00:21:10.466
And its authority derives from
the explanatory power of its

00:21:10.466 --> 00:21:15.036
insights into and understanding
of God's governance of the world

00:21:15.036 --> 00:21:17.140
and his plans for Israel.
 

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.007
So those insights and those
understandings may shift,

00:21:20.007 --> 00:21:22.819
and even stand in contradiction
with one another,

00:21:22.819 --> 00:21:25.000
but they are not mutually
exclusive and their

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.279
contradictions don't affect
their authority,

00:21:27.279 --> 00:21:30.585
their ability to explain,
to console--their ability to

00:21:30.585 --> 00:21:34.264
nourish the faith of a people
convinced that God would never

00:21:34.264 --> 00:21:37.195
desert them no matter how
difficult it may be to

00:21:37.195 --> 00:21:39.940
understand his interactions with
them.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:44.146
Back to Ezekiel now;
and in chapter 33 we learn that

00:21:44.146 --> 00:21:49.630
a fugitive from Jerusalem brings
news of the fall of Jerusalem.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:54.495
So it's about 587,586;
and when he hears this,

00:21:54.495 --> 00:21:59.549
Ezekiel exchanges his message
of doom for a message of hope.

00:21:59.549 --> 00:22:02.937
Before the fall of the city,
his task had been to shatter

00:22:02.937 --> 00:22:04.450
the people's illusions.
 

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:09.060
He wanted to shake them out of
their complacency,

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:14.440
but now the people are reduced
to despair and remorse,

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.930
and his task is to offer
reassurance and hope.

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:21.559
God is going to initiate a new
beginning.

00:22:21.559 --> 00:22:25.201
Though Israel's punishment was
deserved, it was not,

00:22:25.201 --> 00:22:28.414
according to Ezekiel,
a sign of the end of the

00:22:28.414 --> 00:22:31.769
relationship between Yahweh and
his people,

00:22:31.769 --> 00:22:35.457
and a new Israel would rise
from the remnant of Judah and

00:22:35.457 --> 00:22:38.050
Israel.
He expresses this restoration

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.809
by means of many metaphors and
visions.

00:22:40.809 --> 00:22:43.849
So chapter 34 condemns the
shepherds.

00:22:43.849 --> 00:22:46.309
This is a very common Ancient
Near Eastern metaphor for the

00:22:46.309 --> 00:22:48.993
leadership of a people;
a king is always a shepherd and

00:22:48.993 --> 00:22:51.088
so on.
So chapter 34 condemns the

00:22:51.088 --> 00:22:55.009
shepherds of the people and
promises to set up in the future

00:22:55.009 --> 00:22:58.732
one shepherd of the House of
David to be prince among the

00:22:58.732 --> 00:23:02.301
people.
Chapter 36 uses metaphors of

00:23:02.301 --> 00:23:04.480
purity and cleansing.
 

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.539
Israel will be cleansed from
the impurities of the past.

00:23:07.539 --> 00:23:10.369
She'll be given a new covenant
of the heart.

00:23:10.369 --> 00:23:14.779
This is in verses 24 and 25 in
chapter 36.

00:23:14.779 --> 00:23:17.574
I will take you from
among the nations and gather you

00:23:17.574 --> 00:23:20.416
from all the countries and I
will bring you back to your own

00:23:20.416 --> 00:23:22.313
land.
I will sprinkle clean water

00:23:22.313 --> 00:23:25.240
upon you [pure water upon you],
and you shall be clean:

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.083
[Pure.]
I will cleanse you from all

00:23:27.083 --> 00:23:29.740
your uncleanness and from all
your fetishes.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.889
And I will give you a new heart
and put a new spirit into you:

00:23:32.889 --> 00:23:35.729
I will remove the heart of
stone from your body and give

00:23:35.729 --> 00:23:38.580
you a heart of flesh;
and I will put My spirit into

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.875
you.
Thus I will cause you to follow

00:23:40.875 --> 00:23:43.750
My laws and faithfully to
observe My rules.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.823
[There are echoes here of
Jeremiah also.]

00:23:45.823 --> 00:23:48.518
Then you shall dwell in the
land which I gave to your

00:23:48.518 --> 00:23:50.934
fathers,
and you shall be my people and

00:23:50.934 --> 00:23:54.364
I will be your God.
So we have again this almost

00:23:54.364 --> 00:23:58.380
utopian redesign of human nature
that we heard in Jeremiah.

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:02.946
One in which the problems that
are associated with the exercise

00:24:02.946 --> 00:24:05.230
of free will may be obviated.
 

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:09.226
Another metaphor that's used
for the restoration of a new

00:24:09.226 --> 00:24:12.009
Israel out of the remnant of the
old,

00:24:12.009 --> 00:24:16.533
is the metaphor of revival from
death and this is found in

00:24:16.533 --> 00:24:19.409
chapter 37--a very,
very famous passage:

00:24:19.409 --> 00:24:22.190
Ezekiel's vision of the valley
of dry bones:

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:24.069
The hand of the Lord came
upon me.

00:24:24.069 --> 00:24:27.257
He took me out by the spirit of
the LORD and set me down in the

00:24:27.257 --> 00:24:29.350
valley.
It was full of bones.

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:31.791
He led me all around them;
there were very many of them

00:24:31.791 --> 00:24:33.730
spread over the valley,
and they were very dry.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.779
He said to me,
"O mortal, can these bones live

00:24:36.779 --> 00:24:38.805
again?"
I replied, "O Lord GOD,

00:24:38.805 --> 00:24:41.125
only you know."
[Very diplomatic answer.]

00:24:41.125 --> 00:24:43.690
And He said to me,
"Prophesy over these bones and

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:46.630
say to them: O dry bones,
hear the word of the LORD!

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:49.988
Thus said the Lord GOD to these
bones: I will cause breath to

00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:52.059
enter you and you shall live
again.

00:24:52.059 --> 00:24:54.673
I will lay sinews upon you,
and cover you with flesh,

00:24:54.673 --> 00:24:55.930
and form skin over you.
 

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.470
And I will put breath into you,
and you shall live again,

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.329
and you shall know that I am
the LORD!"

00:25:00.329 --> 00:25:02.980
I prophesied as I had been
commanded.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.967
And while I was prophesying,
suddenly there was a sound of

00:25:05.967 --> 00:25:09.269
rattling, and the bones came
together, bone to matching bone.

00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:11.839
I looked, and there were sinews
on them, and flesh had grown,

00:25:11.839 --> 00:25:13.210
and skin had formed over them.
 

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:14.838
…
The breath entered them,

00:25:14.838 --> 00:25:17.034
and they came to life and stood
up on their feet,

00:25:17.034 --> 00:25:17.950
a vast multitude.
 

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:21.049
And He said to me,
"O mortal, these bones are the

00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:22.599
whole House of Israel.
 

00:25:22.599 --> 00:25:25.650
They say, 'Our bones are dried
up, our house is gone;

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:27.896
we are doomed.'
Prophesy, therefore,

00:25:27.896 --> 00:25:29.742
and say to them:
Thus said the LORD GOD:

00:25:29.742 --> 00:25:32.819
I am going to open your graves
and lift you out of the graves,

00:25:32.819 --> 00:25:34.779
O My people,
and bring you to the land of

00:25:34.779 --> 00:25:35.842
Israel.
You shall know,

00:25:35.842 --> 00:25:37.585
O My people,
that I am the Lord when I have

00:25:37.585 --> 00:25:39.910
opened your graves and lifted
you out of your graves.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:42.805
I will put my breath into you
and you shall live again,

00:25:42.805 --> 00:25:44.950
and I will set you upon your
own soil.

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.793
Then you shall know that I the
LORD have spoken and have

00:25:47.793 --> 00:25:51.040
acted--declares the LORD.
In the interpretation that

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.706
follows the vision,
we are told that the bones

00:25:53.706 --> 00:25:55.780
symbolize Israel now,
in this state,

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.852
in exile.
In their despair they're

00:25:57.852 --> 00:26:00.855
crying: our bones are dried up,
we're dead, now our hope is

00:26:00.855 --> 00:26:02.814
lost.
And God promises to raise

00:26:02.814 --> 00:26:06.150
Israel from the grave,
which is a metaphor for exile,

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.993
and restore her to her own land
as one people,

00:26:08.993 --> 00:26:11.774
north and south,
with one prince to rule over

00:26:11.774 --> 00:26:13.710
her.
This text has often been

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:17.405
de-contextualized and cited as
an Old Testament or Hebrew Bible

00:26:17.405 --> 00:26:20.504
source for the doctrine of
literal resurrection after

00:26:20.504 --> 00:26:22.298
death,
as if it's speaking about

00:26:22.298 --> 00:26:23.299
literal resurrection.
 

00:26:23.299 --> 00:26:26.975
But I think in its context it's
quite clear that it is one of

00:26:26.975 --> 00:26:30.835
many metaphors that Ezekiel uses
throughout this section for the

00:26:30.835 --> 00:26:33.470
redemption of the community from
exile,

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:37.700
the restoration of the people
back in their own land.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:42.126
At the center of the restored
community that Ezekiel envisions

00:26:42.126 --> 00:26:45.681
is a new Jerusalem,
and at its center is a rebuilt

00:26:45.681 --> 00:26:48.125
temple.
And it is described in great

00:26:48.125 --> 00:26:50.829
detail in the last nine chapters
of the book.

00:26:50.829 --> 00:26:54.097
In Ezekiel's utopian vision,
the land is equally allotted,

00:26:54.097 --> 00:26:57.250
it's divided up and equally
allotted among all 12 tribes

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:59.200
now, who will be brought back.
 

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.892
And Jerusalem lies in the
center with 12 great gates,

00:27:02.892 --> 00:27:05.519
one for each tribe,
surrounding it.

00:27:05.519 --> 00:27:09.809
This temple is the source of a
never-ending river that gushes

00:27:09.809 --> 00:27:13.026
forth from it,
a river that will make the Dead

00:27:13.026 --> 00:27:15.599
Sea flow with fresh water again.
 

00:27:15.599 --> 00:27:18.765
Ezekiel sees Zadokite priests
presiding in the Temple,

00:27:18.765 --> 00:27:22.229
they are assisted by Levites
who are just menials (they are

00:27:22.229 --> 00:27:24.319
sort of demoted in his vision).
 

00:27:24.319 --> 00:27:27.900
And he insists no foreigners
will be permitted entry.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.160
We're going to see that that's
a view that wasn't shared by

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.240
others in the post-destruction
era.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:39.034
While Ezekiel believed that God
would restore a purified Israel

00:27:39.034 --> 00:27:42.680
to its land under a Davidic
monarchy,

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.942
and he prophesied to this
effect, he, like Jeremiah,

00:27:45.942 --> 00:27:48.948
also maintained that a
relationship with God was

00:27:48.948 --> 00:27:52.237
possible,
in the meantime--a relationship

00:27:52.237 --> 00:27:54.220
outside the chosen land.
 

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:57.849
And the Jewish diaspora
("diaspora" refers to a

00:27:57.849 --> 00:28:02.662
community living outside of its
homeland)--the Jewish diaspora

00:28:02.662 --> 00:28:06.130
was a new thing;
it was a religious-national

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:09.349
body of a type that had not been
seen before.

00:28:09.349 --> 00:28:12.279
You had a people remaining
loyal to their God,

00:28:12.279 --> 00:28:16.119
while in exile from their own
land (and what was believed to

00:28:16.119 --> 00:28:19.960
be that God's land) without
worshipping him cultically,

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.880
or by means of sacrifice.
 

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.160
Remember the only legitimate
site for an altar or for

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.180
sacrifice to God is Jerusalem.
 

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.972
And in time,
slowly, a new worship will be

00:28:29.972 --> 00:28:32.235
fashioned;
one without sacrifice,

00:28:32.235 --> 00:28:35.716
one that consists of prayer and
confession, and fasts,

00:28:35.716 --> 00:28:38.410
and other kinds of ritual
observances.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:41.579
Three times a day Jews will
pray and they'll pray in the

00:28:41.579 --> 00:28:43.019
direction of Jerusalem.
 

00:28:43.019 --> 00:28:46.175
Worship in synagogues
eventually will come into being,

00:28:46.175 --> 00:28:49.450
and the importance of the
Sabbath will grow--the Sabbath

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:53.319
as a memorial of the covenant
and the symbol of Jewish faith.

00:28:53.319 --> 00:28:56.505
And so you also find,
beginning shortly after this

00:28:56.505 --> 00:29:00.780
period, for the first time,
non-Jews are joining themselves

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:04.559
to Yahweh, adopting this
religion of Israel out of

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:07.928
religious conviction,
not simply because they may be

00:29:07.928 --> 00:29:10.560
residing in the land and have to
follow God's laws.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.019
This is outside the land.
 

00:29:12.019 --> 00:29:14.559
You have people choosing to opt
into this community.

00:29:14.559 --> 00:29:18.488
So again, we see that as the
history of the nation of Israel

00:29:18.488 --> 00:29:21.019
came to an end,
the history of Judaism,

00:29:21.019 --> 00:29:23.349
the "religion" Judaism,
begins.

00:29:23.349 --> 00:29:26.949
So in Ezekiel we've seen one
response to the national

00:29:26.949 --> 00:29:30.549
disaster and the exile:
the idea that while suffering

00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:33.180
and punishment are fully
deserved,

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.369
a relationship with God remains
possible.

00:29:35.369 --> 00:29:38.299
God is with his people even in
exile.

00:29:38.299 --> 00:29:41.651
A second response to the
destruction and exile can be

00:29:41.651 --> 00:29:45.711
found in the anonymous writings
that are appended to the Book of

00:29:45.711 --> 00:29:47.920
Isaiah.
I mentioned these writings

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.921
briefly.
We'll be able to look now at

00:29:49.921 --> 00:29:51.720
what's been called Second
Isaiah.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.325
So there are two discrete units
of material that are appended to

00:29:55.325 --> 00:29:58.381
Isaiah.
Chapters 40 to 55 are referred

00:29:58.381 --> 00:30:02.192
to as Second Isaiah,
and chapters 56 to 66 are

00:30:02.192 --> 00:30:04.480
referred to as 3 Isaiah.
 

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.161
And these chapters differ from
Isaiah proper,

00:30:07.161 --> 00:30:10.269
from the eighth-century
prophet, in several ways.

00:30:10.269 --> 00:30:14.992
It's clear, first of all,
that these parts of Isaiah were

00:30:14.992 --> 00:30:17.269
written after the Exile .
 

00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:21.125
Parts of Third Isaiah were
written after the Exile,

00:30:21.125 --> 00:30:25.058
all of second Isaiah,
(and Isaiah proper was clearly

00:30:25.058 --> 00:30:30.380
written in the eighth century on
into the early seventh century).

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:33.400
Jerusalem is referred to as
destroyed.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.390
The audience that's addressed
is living in exile.

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:39.180
Babylon is the oppressor,
not Assyria.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.319
Assyria was the oppressor in
the time of Isaiah proper.

00:30:42.319 --> 00:30:46.503
The appended materials even
seem to know of the overthrow of

00:30:46.503 --> 00:30:49.888
the Babylonians.
That's going to happen in about

00:30:49.888 --> 00:30:53.630
539 when Cyrus of Persia will
conquer the Babylonians.

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:57.194
We have passages that express
some euphoria over this,

00:30:57.194 --> 00:30:59.009
because Cyrus,
of course,

00:30:59.009 --> 00:31:03.000
authorized the Jews to return
from Babylon to Jerusalem to

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.609
rebuild their temple.
 

00:31:04.609 --> 00:31:08.473
There are also all kinds of
stylistic differences between

00:31:08.473 --> 00:31:11.440
First Isaiah and Second and
Third Isaiah.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.473
Second and Third Isaiah,
for example,

00:31:13.473 --> 00:31:16.920
have no biographical data and
First Isaiah has quite a bit.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.535
These materials also have a
different theology of history,

00:31:20.535 --> 00:31:23.009
a different understanding of
history,

00:31:23.009 --> 00:31:26.420
a different attitude towards
foreign nations and a very

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:29.200
strong and renewed emphasis on
monotheism.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.490
These also mark it as different.
 

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.997
Among the scrolls that were
found in the caves at Qumran

00:31:34.997 --> 00:31:37.995
near the Dead Sea,
we have a very large and very

00:31:37.995 --> 00:31:41.778
famous Isaiah scroll,
which is now in a museum in

00:31:41.778 --> 00:31:44.774
Jerusalem.
On the scroll there is a gap

00:31:44.774 --> 00:31:48.082
after Isaiah 39,
and a new column starts with

00:31:48.082 --> 00:31:50.507
Isaiah 40.
So it seems to signal some sort

00:31:50.507 --> 00:31:53.122
of implicit recognition that
there's a difference between

00:31:53.122 --> 00:31:54.150
these two sections.
 

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:58.079
They are not the same unit,
not the same author perhaps.

00:31:58.079 --> 00:32:01.708
So we're going to talk right
now about Second Isaiah because

00:32:01.708 --> 00:32:04.230
this is a wholly post
destruction work.

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:08.454
The opening or inaugural oracle
that occurs in chapter 40 is an

00:32:08.454 --> 00:32:10.089
oracle of consolation.
 

00:32:10.089 --> 00:32:13.603
It's an oracle of comfort,
and the prophet sees a straight

00:32:13.603 --> 00:32:17.177
and level highway prepared in
the wilderness for a dramatic

00:32:17.177 --> 00:32:20.259
procession of Yahweh the
shepherd who will lead his

00:32:20.259 --> 00:32:22.170
people back to Jerusalem.
 

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:24.892
It's very, very famous--made
very famous by Handel's Messiah

00:32:24.892 --> 00:32:27.263
actually.
So chapter 40 (taking from

00:32:27.263 --> 00:32:30.329
various verses in this chapter):
Comfort,

00:32:30.329 --> 00:32:32.540
oh comfort My people,
Says Your God.

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.789
Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,
And declare to her

00:32:35.789 --> 00:32:37.370
That her term of service is
over,

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:41.023
That iniquity is expiated;
For she has received at the

00:32:41.023 --> 00:32:43.700
hand of the LORD
Double for all her sins.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.770
A voice rings out:
"Clear in the desert

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:48.050
A road for the Lord!
 

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:50.740
Level in the wilderness
A highway for our God!

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:54.140
Let every valley be raised,
Every hill and mount made low.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.160
Let the rugged ground become
level

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.720
And the ridges become a plain.
 

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.450
The Presence of the LORD shall
appear,

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.990
And all flesh,
as one, shall behold--

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:03.660
For the LORD Himself has
spoken."

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.900
A voice rings out: "Proclaim!"
 

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.890
Another asks,
"What shall I proclaim?"

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:10.668
All flesh is grass,
All its goodness like flowers

00:33:10.668 --> 00:33:12.369
of the field:
…

00:33:12.369 --> 00:33:14.060
But the word of our God is
always fulfilled!"

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.173
…
Behold, the Lord GOD comes in

00:33:16.173 --> 00:33:17.160
might,
…

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.080
Like a shepherd He pastures His
flock:

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.769
He gathers the lambs in His arms
And carries them in His bosom;

00:33:22.769 --> 00:33:25.019
Gently he drives the mother
sheep.

00:33:25.019 --> 00:33:28.142
So this highway will appear
leading the exiles straight to

00:33:28.142 --> 00:33:30.596
Jerusalem.
All of the topography will be

00:33:30.596 --> 00:33:34.500
flattened and God will lead them
as a shepherd leads the lamb.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.729
Why?
Because the word of the Lord is

00:33:36.729 --> 00:33:37.940
always fulfilled.
 

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:41.147
So what this voice is
proclaiming is a literal return

00:33:41.147 --> 00:33:43.380
from exile.
God is opening a highway,

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:46.869
he's leading His flock home
like a shepherd in a new exodus.

00:33:46.869 --> 00:33:50.470
And this is an idea that's so
important that it recurs at the

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:53.769
end of the unit as well in
chapter 55: the idea of a new

00:33:53.769 --> 00:33:56.120
exodus.
A second key theme that's

00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:00.448
sounded at the beginning and end
of the unit again (so it happens

00:34:00.448 --> 00:34:04.167
in chapter 40 and again in
chapter 55) is this idea that

00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:07.210
the word of our God is always
fulfilled.

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:10.319
Or in some translations,
the word of our God "stands

00:34:10.319 --> 00:34:13.211
forever."
This idea is the essence of the

00:34:13.211 --> 00:34:17.296
Israelites' hope during the
period of captivity and exile,

00:34:17.296 --> 00:34:20.019
and it appears in the first
oracle.

00:34:20.019 --> 00:34:22.909
It's beautifully restated in
the last oracle,

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:25.469
in chapter 55,
verses 10 through 12:

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:28.560
For as the rain or snow
drops from heaven

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.409
And returns not there,
But soaks the earth

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:33.139
And makes it bring forth
vegetation,

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:35.989
Yielding seed for sowing and
bread for eating,

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:38.500
So is the word that issues from
my mouth:

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.740
It does not come back to Me
unfulfilled,

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:44.769
But performs what I purpose,
Achieves what I sent it to do.

00:34:44.769 --> 00:34:47.690
Yea, you shall leave in joy and
be led home

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:50.448
secure.
Before you, mount and hill

00:34:50.448 --> 00:34:53.394
shall shout aloud,
And all the trees of the field

00:34:53.394 --> 00:34:56.768
shall clap their hands.
So the everlasting word of the

00:34:56.768 --> 00:34:59.549
Lord--it's guaranteed
fulfillment (specifically--to

00:34:59.549 --> 00:35:02.997
bring his people home in a new
exodus)--these are ideas form an

00:35:02.997 --> 00:35:07.071
envelope or an inclusio,
that kind of literary structure

00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:11.148
where something is mentioned at
the beginning and again at the

00:35:11.148 --> 00:35:15.292
end to form an inclusio
or an envelope around the entire

00:35:15.292 --> 00:35:17.030
unit of SecondIsaiah.
 

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:21.019
We see also in Second Isaiah an
extreme monotheism.

00:35:21.019 --> 00:35:24.392
The monotheism is explicit of
course in Isaiah--implicit,

00:35:24.392 --> 00:35:27.945
I'm sorry, implicit in Isaiah,
but it becomes quite explicit

00:35:27.945 --> 00:35:29.210
in Second Isaiah.
 

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:32.497
As we've seen,
to come to terms with the

00:35:32.497 --> 00:35:37.301
destruction of 587 entails the
acceptance of the idea that

00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:40.420
Israel's punishment was
deserved,

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:44.599
and Yahweh's control of history
means he controls not only

00:35:44.599 --> 00:35:49.000
Israel but all other nations as
well and can use them for his

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.530
purpose,
including punishing Israel.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:53.960
There's no power other than
Yahweh.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:58.280
So referring then to the rise
and fall of nations,

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.807
Isaiah 41:4 states,
Who has wrought and

00:36:01.807 --> 00:36:03.574
achieved this?
He who announced the

00:36:03.574 --> 00:36:05.290
generations from the
start--

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:08.467
I, the LORD, who was first
And will be with the last as

00:36:08.467 --> 00:36:10.510
well.
The first and the last--which

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:12.700
is a way of saying everything,
all inclusive.

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.389
There is nothing but me.
 

00:36:14.389 --> 00:36:18.289
And Isaiah 44 satirizes those
nations who make and worship

00:36:18.289 --> 00:36:22.121
idols, and ridicules the folly
and stupidity of ascribing

00:36:22.121 --> 00:36:26.500
divinity to that which one has
created with one's own hands.

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.818
In Isaiah 41,
God states his case against

00:36:29.818 --> 00:36:32.389
these vain and useless idols.
 

00:36:32.389 --> 00:36:36.030
He summons them to answer for
themselves, show that they are

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:38.929
gods by announcing something
that will occur,

00:36:38.929 --> 00:36:41.340
announcing what will occur and
seeing if it comes true.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:45.279
Chapter 41:22-24:
Let them approach and

00:36:45.279 --> 00:36:46.550
tell us what will happen.
 

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:49.340
Tell us what has occurred,
And we will take note of it;

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.910
Or announce to us what will
occur,

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:52.620
That we may know the outcome.
 

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:55.743
Foretell what is yet to happen,
That we may know that you are

00:36:55.743 --> 00:36:57.850
gods!
Do anything, good or bad,

00:36:57.850 --> 00:36:59.800
That we may be awed and see.
 

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.010
Why, you are less than nothing.
 

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:04.349
Your effect is less than
nullity;

00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:07.889
One who chooses you is an
abomination.

00:37:07.889 --> 00:37:11.675
But this is only half the
picture because not only are the

00:37:11.675 --> 00:37:15.461
gods of the nations no gods,
but Yahweh is the true God of

00:37:15.461 --> 00:37:17.519
all of these other nations.
 

00:37:17.519 --> 00:37:20.996
So who raised Cyrus of Persia
from the north to sweep through

00:37:20.996 --> 00:37:24.010
the Ancient Near East and
conquer the Babylonians?

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:25.320
No one but Yahweh.
 

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.121
Isaiah 41:
"I have roused Him from

00:37:28.121 --> 00:37:31.189
the north, and he has come
…And He has trampled rulers

00:37:31.189 --> 00:37:33.590
like mud,
Like a potter treading clay

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:35.710
…The things once predicted to
Zion--

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:38.579
Behold, here they are!" [from
vv 25-29].

00:37:38.579 --> 00:37:41.658
So in these passages,
the author of Second Isaiah is

00:37:41.658 --> 00:37:44.890
drawing the logical conclusion,
perhaps, towards which

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:47.710
Israelite religion has tended
from its inception.

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:50.707
Yahweh, once a Canaanite deity,
then the God of Israel's

00:37:50.707 --> 00:37:53.050
patriarchs, then the national
God of Israel,

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:55.340
is here the Lord of universal
history.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:58.794
The only real God,
Second Isaiah is claiming,

00:37:58.794 --> 00:38:00.599
is the God of Israel.
 

00:38:00.599 --> 00:38:04.650
Second Isaiah is also quite
well known for the Servant Songs

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:07.739
that it contains,
the famous servant songs.

00:38:07.739 --> 00:38:13.148
These occur scattered in
chapter 42, chapter 49,

00:38:13.148 --> 00:38:19.132
chapter 50, and then most
extensively 52:13 to 53:12,

00:38:19.132 --> 00:38:22.010
so much of 52 and 53.
 

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:24.256
The identity of this
servant--I'll read some of these

00:38:24.256 --> 00:38:26.590
passages in a minute,
but it refers to this servant,

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:28.883
God's servant,
and the identity of the servant

00:38:28.883 --> 00:38:31.889
has been a puzzle to biblical
interpreters for centuries.

00:38:31.889 --> 00:38:34.360
Sometimes the servant is
referred to as a collective

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.267
figure, sometimes the servant is
referred to as an individual

00:38:37.267 --> 00:38:39.846
figure.
In chapter 49 the servant is

00:38:39.846 --> 00:38:44.305
referred to or described as a
prophet with a universal message

00:38:44.305 --> 00:38:47.960
rather than a message for the
Israelites alone,

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.179
but then there's some ambiguity
here.

00:38:51.179 --> 00:38:54.478
The servant is first
identified, or the prophet--the

00:38:54.478 --> 00:38:58.360
servant or prophet--is first
identified as Israel herself.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:03.019
So in chapter 49:1-3:
…The Lord appointed me

00:39:03.019 --> 00:39:05.945
before I was born,
He named me while I was in my

00:39:05.945 --> 00:39:08.403
mother's womb.
He made my mouth like a

00:39:08.403 --> 00:39:11.538
sharpened blade,
He hid me in the shadow of His

00:39:11.538 --> 00:39:13.845
hand,
And He made me like a polished

00:39:13.845 --> 00:39:16.219
arrow;
He concealed me in His quiver

00:39:16.219 --> 00:39:18.710
And He said to me,
"You are My servant,

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:23.894
Israel in whom I glory."
Yet, in verse 5 it would seem

00:39:23.894 --> 00:39:28.616
that this prophet/servant has a
mission to Israel to bring her

00:39:28.616 --> 00:39:31.777
back to Yahweh,
and that would imply that the

00:39:31.777 --> 00:39:33.850
servant or prophet is not
Israel.

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:35.570
Verse 5:
And now the LORD has

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:37.303
resolved--
He who formed me in the womb to

00:39:37.303 --> 00:39:38.540
be His
servant--

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:44.709
To bring back Jacob to Himself,
That Israel may be restored to

00:39:44.709 --> 00:39:47.329
Him.
For He has said:

00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:50.030
"It is too little that you
should be My servant

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:52.170
In that I raise up the tribes
of Jacob

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:54.130
And restore the survivors of
Israel:

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:57.170
I will also make you a light of
nations,

00:39:57.170 --> 00:40:01.090
That My salvation may reach the
ends of the earth."

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:05.040
Chapter 50 quite famously
refers to the servant as

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.540
rebellious and as persecuted.
 

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:10.670
Verse 6:
I offered my back to the

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:12.943
floggers,
And my cheeks to those who tore

00:40:12.943 --> 00:40:15.160
out my hair.
I did not hide my face

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:18.634
From insult and spittle.
But it's the famous and

00:40:18.634 --> 00:40:23.254
difficult passage in Isaiah 53
that most movingly describes the

00:40:23.254 --> 00:40:26.310
suffering and sorrow of God's
servant.

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:29.655
53:3-11:
…He was despised,

00:40:29.655 --> 00:40:31.260
we held him of no account.
 

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:34.400
Yet it was our sickness that he
was bearing,

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.260
Our suffering that he endured.
 

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:40.429
We accounted him plagued,
Smitten and afflicted by God

00:40:40.429 --> 00:40:42.480
But he was wounded because of
our sins,

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.559
Crushed because of our
iniquities.

00:40:44.559 --> 00:40:47.289
He bore the chastisement that
made us whole,

00:40:47.289 --> 00:40:50.290
And by his bruises we were
healed.

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:53.510
We all went astray like sheep,
Each going his own way;

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:57.090
And the LORD visited upon him
The guilt of all of us."

00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:59.830
He was maltreated,
yet he was submissive,

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:02.794
He did not open his mouth;
Like a sheep being led to

00:41:02.794 --> 00:41:05.558
slaughter,
Like a ewe, dumb before those

00:41:05.558 --> 00:41:07.950
who shear her,
He did not open his mouth.

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:10.209
…
And his grave was set among the

00:41:10.209 --> 00:41:11.650
wicked,
And with the rich,

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:14.370
in his death--
Though he had done no injustice

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:16.260
And had spoken no falsehood.
 

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:19.159
But the LORD chose to crush him
by disease,

00:41:19.159 --> 00:41:21.630
That, if he made himself an
offering for guilt,

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:24.760
He might see offspring and have
long life,

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.989
And that through him the LORD's
purpose might prosper.

00:41:28.989 --> 00:41:33.063
There have been many attempts
to equate this man of sorrows

00:41:33.063 --> 00:41:35.030
with all kinds of figures.
 

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:39.412
Early on, Jesus' followers saw
Jesus as the suffering servant

00:41:39.412 --> 00:41:40.800
of God in Isaiah.
 

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.905
The New Testament writers
specifically borrowed passages

00:41:43.905 --> 00:41:46.219
from Isaiah, particularly this
chapter,

00:41:46.219 --> 00:41:49.463
chapter 53, when constructing
their narratives of Jesus,

00:41:49.463 --> 00:41:53.059
taking those verses and using
them in describing his story.

00:41:53.059 --> 00:41:56.317
So he is depicted as the
innocent and righteous servant

00:41:56.317 --> 00:41:58.610
who suffered for the sins of
others.

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:01.189
In the teachings of Paul,
however, you have a different

00:42:01.189 --> 00:42:02.239
use of these verses.
 

00:42:02.239 --> 00:42:05.463
Christians, generally,
are identified as the servant

00:42:05.463 --> 00:42:07.550
who suffers with and for Jesus.
 

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:10.897
Despite these later theological
interpretations,

00:42:10.897 --> 00:42:15.100
the anonymous writer of Second
Isaiah wasn't writing about a

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:19.018
remote Nazarean teacher and
charismatic healer who would

00:42:19.018 --> 00:42:22.010
live more than five centuries
later.

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:25.299
Examined in its original
context, it appears most likely

00:42:25.299 --> 00:42:28.768
that the servant is Israel
herself described metaphorically

00:42:28.768 --> 00:42:32.476
as an individual whose present
suffering and humiliation is due

00:42:32.476 --> 00:42:36.591
to the sins of other nations,
but whose future restoration

00:42:36.591 --> 00:42:40.706
and exultation will cause
astonishment among those nations

00:42:40.706 --> 00:42:43.449
who will then be humbled to
Yahweh.

00:42:43.449 --> 00:42:46.490
But there are problems with
even this interpretation and you

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:47.829
should be aware of that.
 

00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:50.090
This has never been solved
satisfactorily.

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:52.754
The main problem with
interpreting Israel as the

00:42:52.754 --> 00:42:55.929
servant is the verse that
describes the servant as having

00:42:55.929 --> 00:42:57.289
a mission to Israel.
 

00:42:57.289 --> 00:43:00.960
It seems a little odd to say
that Israel bears a mission to

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.750
Israel.
But this problem can be solved,

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:07.760
if we remember that Israel was
often divided in prophetic

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.813
rhetoric.
So perhaps the writer envisions

00:43:10.813 --> 00:43:13.714
a mission of one part,
the righteous part,

00:43:13.714 --> 00:43:17.039
to the other,
the part that has gone astray.

00:43:17.039 --> 00:43:20.768
Leaving aside this difficulty,
the more prominent motif in the

00:43:20.768 --> 00:43:24.558
servant song of Isaiah is that
the servant has a mission to the

00:43:24.558 --> 00:43:26.533
world.
That's the more prominent

00:43:26.533 --> 00:43:29.860
motif, and that is a role that
would suit Israel quite well.

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:32.008
Furthermore,
you have the phrase,

00:43:32.008 --> 00:43:35.968
"Israel, My servant," appearing
in Second Isaiah about eight

00:43:35.968 --> 00:43:38.603
times.
So the idea of Israel as God's

00:43:38.603 --> 00:43:41.941
servant to the nations is
clearly a part of Isaiah's

00:43:41.941 --> 00:43:45.075
conceptual world,
and since we're dealing with

00:43:45.075 --> 00:43:48.597
poetry rather than a rigorously
consistent metaphysical

00:43:48.597 --> 00:43:50.718
treatise,
it shouldn't be too surprising

00:43:50.718 --> 00:43:52.905
that sometimes the servant is
spoken of as a group

00:43:52.905 --> 00:43:55.239
collectively,
sometimes as an individual.

00:43:55.239 --> 00:43:57.780
The same holds true of Israel
in general, by the way,

00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:59.539
throughout much of the
literature.

00:43:59.539 --> 00:44:02.634
Sometimes Israel is spoken of
in plural terms and sometimes as

00:44:02.634 --> 00:44:03.750
a single individual.
 

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:07.643
So in its original context it's
likely that the servant refers

00:44:07.643 --> 00:44:08.920
to Israel herself.
 

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:12.848
If the servant is Israel,
then we can see how Second

00:44:12.848 --> 00:44:16.699
Isaiah is another response to
the events of 587.

00:44:16.699 --> 00:44:19.735
And it's ultimately a positive
interpretation,

00:44:19.735 --> 00:44:21.219
a positive response.
 

00:44:21.219 --> 00:44:24.678
The punishment that Israel
suffered even if excessive

00:44:24.678 --> 00:44:28.735
(remember Isaiah 40 claims that
Israel has suffered double for

00:44:28.735 --> 00:44:31.072
her sins,
so it's been an excessive

00:44:31.072 --> 00:44:33.900
punishment)--that punishment
isn't meaningless.

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.849
It will lead to redemption.
 

00:44:35.849 --> 00:44:38.679
Israel will be healed by her
wounds.

00:44:38.679 --> 00:44:41.539
God's word will not be returned
unfulfilled.

00:44:41.539 --> 00:44:44.216
In addition,
suffering leads to a new role

00:44:44.216 --> 00:44:46.239
for Israel among the nations.
 

00:44:46.239 --> 00:44:50.850
Second Isaiah expresses a new
self-awareness that is taking

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:52.440
hold in the exile.
 

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.902
Israel saw itself as the
faithful servant of Yahweh,

00:44:55.902 --> 00:45:00.112
a servant whose loyalty to God
in this dark time would serve to

00:45:00.112 --> 00:45:04.050
broadcast the knowledge of God
throughout the nations.

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:07.973
So Israel was chosen from the
womb to serve God's universal

00:45:07.973 --> 00:45:10.657
purpose.
Israel suffered unobserved by

00:45:10.657 --> 00:45:14.119
others, but eventually this
would make possible the

00:45:14.119 --> 00:45:16.750
recognition of God by those
others.

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:21.075
Where once God covenanted with
David to lead his people,

00:45:21.075 --> 00:45:25.636
Israel, he now covenants with
Israel to lead the nations of

00:45:25.636 --> 00:45:27.760
the world in God's way.
 

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:32.520
It's an expansion of God's
purpose, and this is an idea

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:37.828
that appears in Isaiah 55:3-5:
Incline your ear and come

00:45:37.828 --> 00:45:39.962
to Me;
Harken, and you shall be

00:45:39.962 --> 00:45:41.898
revived.
And I will make with you an

00:45:41.898 --> 00:45:45.034
everlasting covenant,
The enduring loyalty promised

00:45:45.034 --> 00:45:47.082
to David.
[The covenant and loyalty that

00:45:47.082 --> 00:45:49.409
was promised to David I'm now
transferring to you.]

00:45:49.409 --> 00:45:51.610
As I made him a leader of
peoples,

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:53.699
A prince and commander of
peoples,

00:45:53.699 --> 00:45:57.050
So you shall summon a nation
who you did not know,

00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:58.590
And a nation that did not know
you,

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:01.713
Shall come running to you--
For the sake of the LORD your

00:46:01.713 --> 00:46:03.795
God,
The Holy One of Israel who has

00:46:03.795 --> 00:46:06.783
glorified you.
So God makes an eternal

00:46:06.783 --> 00:46:10.380
covenant with Israel,
like that he once concluded

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:13.076
with David.
And the function of the

00:46:13.076 --> 00:46:17.442
institutions of the old order
are transferred to the nation as

00:46:17.442 --> 00:46:19.869
a whole.
What kings and priests,

00:46:19.869 --> 00:46:23.720
and prophets did for Israel,
Israel will now do for the

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:27.068
whole world.
As the mediator between the

00:46:27.068 --> 00:46:32.469
only God and the nations of the
world she is a light unto them,

00:46:32.469 --> 00:46:35.329
and all will ascend to her
because from her will come

00:46:35.329 --> 00:46:38.300
Torah, instruction in the divine
will and salvation.

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:42.064
This is the idea of universal
mission that comes out of Second

00:46:42.064 --> 00:46:43.932
Isaiah.
When we come back on Wednesday,

00:46:43.932 --> 00:46:46.345
we're going to take a look at
what I think is probably the

00:46:46.345 --> 00:46:48.420
single most profound book in the
Hebrew Bible,

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:51.824
the Book of Job.
And again, I'll remind you that

00:46:51.824 --> 00:46:56.033
final paper information will be
available on the Classes server

00:46:56.033 --> 00:46:58.325
tonight.
I want you to have it in time

00:46:58.325 --> 00:47:01.363
to be able to ask questions of
your TF or myself about the

00:47:01.363 --> 00:47:03.451
assignment.
It's pretty detailed so sit and

00:47:03.451 --> 00:47:07.000
read through it carefully;
it'll be there later tonight.

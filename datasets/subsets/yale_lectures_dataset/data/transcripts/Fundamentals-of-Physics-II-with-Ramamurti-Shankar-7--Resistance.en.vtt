00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.197
Prof: When I look at you
guys, I realize that I don't

00:00:04.197 --> 00:00:05.740
know what most of you look like.
 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.350
That's the problem in a big
class like this.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.910
Usually it would be nice if you
know who your students are.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.598
If they say hello,
you can say hello back,

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:19.598
but I don't know what I can do
about it, because if I focus on

00:00:19.598 --> 00:00:22.680
you, I forget what I'm going to
talk about.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.816
But you know what I look like,
and it's kind of an unnerving

00:00:29.816 --> 00:00:36.590
asymmetry, because you might
become my doctor one day.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.712
You'll be wearing a mask and
carrying a knife,

00:00:40.712 --> 00:00:45.293
and you'll be thinking of
problem set number three,

00:00:45.293 --> 00:00:46.210
right?
 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.640
And I won't even know who did
it, so it's very asymmetric.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:59.850
All right.
 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.755
Okay, so anyway,
maybe I'll get to know you if

00:01:03.755 --> 00:01:08.266
you ask a lot of questions,
or your favorite pastime,

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:12.260
finding something wrong on the
blackboard.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.150
Look at that.
 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.890
I didn't do that.
 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.030
I cannot even reach that far.
 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.970
So let me now go back a little
bit,

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.052
because I think I rushed some
of the topics near the end and I

00:01:32.052 --> 00:01:36.550
thought about it some more,
so I think it will be helpful

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.500
to revisit this question about
image charges.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.580
I want you to think about what
the point was.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.489
So here's the main thing:
you all know how to think about

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:47.360
the potential or the field,
right?

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.926
I give you a bunch of charges
and you calculate the potential

00:01:50.926 --> 00:01:53.660
and you take derivatives,
you get the field.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.587
Sometimes that's not the only
kind of problem you have to

00:01:57.587 --> 00:01:58.150
solve.
 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.519
You may have to solve the
following problem.

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:04.489
There is some chunk,
maybe a potato,

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:09.068
and you bring some electric
charge, what does it do?

00:02:09.068 --> 00:02:11.408
That's a meaningful question,
because it does something,

00:02:11.408 --> 00:02:11.750
right?
 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.669
And nature calculates right
away and does something.

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:16.128
But if you want to figure out
what happens,

00:02:16.128 --> 00:02:20.834
it's quite complicated,
so a somewhat easier problem is

00:02:20.834 --> 00:02:24.930
the case of the perfectly
conducting potato,

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.830
which is kind of solid metal,
shaped like whatever you like.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.500
You bring a charge next to it,
what happens?

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.514
That question occurs a lot,
because we do electrical

00:02:35.514 --> 00:02:38.410
experiments in the presence of
many conductors.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.022
And the simple thing about a
conductor is,

00:02:41.022 --> 00:02:43.508
the whole conductor is one
potential.

00:02:43.508 --> 00:02:48.555
So I want to take a simple
problem and see if we can answer

00:02:48.555 --> 00:02:48.990
it.
 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.568
Now most problems,
you cannot answer.

00:02:50.568 --> 00:02:52.639
By "cannot answer"
I don't mean in principle.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.577
In principle,
we know the equations,

00:02:54.577 --> 00:02:57.180
we can solve them,
including the real potato.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.520
You can actually figure out
everything, but it's too hard.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.598
You cannot write it in simple
form.

00:03:02.598 --> 00:03:07.331
There are a few simple textbook
examples where you can ask the

00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:09.658
question and you can answer.
 

00:03:09.658 --> 00:03:15.945
And the question you want to
ask is, here is an infinite

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:20.289
conducting plane and it is
grounded.

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:21.438
Grounded means what?
 

00:03:21.438 --> 00:03:25.658
You take a wire and you connect
it to the earth.

00:03:25.658 --> 00:03:30.646
Now the point of connecting to
the earth is that the earth is

00:03:30.646 --> 00:03:34.720
pretty close to being an object
at 0 potential.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.824
In other words,
if you bring a charge from

00:03:36.824 --> 00:03:39.442
infinity to the earth,
the amount of work you do you

00:03:39.442 --> 00:03:40.520
can take to be 0.
 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.270
And on a daily basis,
people are dumping charge,

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.312
people are taking charge out of
it, but it's so huge,

00:03:46.312 --> 00:03:47.598
it doesn't matter.
 

00:03:47.598 --> 00:03:51.169
It's like one of the reservoirs
you studied in thermodynamics.

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.008
You can take some heat,
you can put some heat.

00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:54.930
It doesn't change its
temperature.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.663
So the earth is a huge
repository where you can take a

00:03:58.663 --> 00:04:01.270
few charges now and put a few
back.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.830
It will always remain at 0.
 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.400
It will force you also to go to
0 potential.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.961
So that is that plane,
and you have another charge,

00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:15.340
q, you slowly bring
towards that plane.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.430
You may like to know what's the
answer to this problem.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.560
What does the field look like
everywhere?

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.908
Now this plane,
for convenience,

00:04:22.908 --> 00:04:24.649
I'm going to be taking to be
infinite.

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:27.829
If you want a side view of that
plane, it looks like this.

00:04:27.829 --> 00:04:30.122
It divides the whole universe
into two parts,

00:04:30.122 --> 00:04:33.459
where you are with your charge
and the rest on the other side.

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:36.389
So what will this plane do?
 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.980
You can see that if it did
nothing, it's in trouble.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.487
If it did nothing,
this charge at that distance

00:04:42.487 --> 00:04:44.449
will produce a positive
potential.

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.656
At that distance,
it will produce an even bigger

00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:48.629
positive potential,
because it's closer.

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.050
So different parts of the sheet
will be at different potentials.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.730
That's not allowed.
 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.060
It's an equipotential.
 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.120
It's a metal.
 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.093
It's got to arrange its
potential to be constant,

00:04:57.093 --> 00:05:00.872
and because it's connected to
the ground, that constant has to

00:05:00.872 --> 00:05:01.430
be 0.
 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.115
So the way it will lower its
potential from your attempts to

00:05:05.115 --> 00:05:08.362
raise it is to suck up some
negative charges from the

00:05:08.362 --> 00:05:09.050
ground.
 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.625
So negative charge will leave
the ground and somehow come and

00:05:12.625 --> 00:05:15.129
stand in front of this positive
charge,

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:19.586
maybe something like this,
over some region roughly

00:05:19.586 --> 00:05:24.670
proportional to the distance
between you and the plane.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.819
Then what will happen is,
the electric field lines,

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:29.220
which normally go through the
metal if it wasn't there,

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.529
will now of course have to come
and terminate on that metal,

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:36.886
and they have to terminate
perpendicularly because the

00:05:36.886 --> 00:05:40.560
electric field is always
perpendicular to the conductor.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.980
You know why, right?
 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.680
Because if you move along the
conductor, the potential cannot

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.315
change, so the line integral of
E must be 0,

00:05:47.315 --> 00:05:49.815
but basically,
you should not feel any force

00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:51.620
as you move along the plane.
 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.350
So E is perpendicular.
 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.370
So some bunch of charges will
be drawn from the ground,

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.720
as necessary,
and this is what will happen.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.874
The question is,
can you say anything more in

00:06:03.874 --> 00:06:04.519
detail?
 

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:09.841
Can you actually calculate the
charge distribution on this

00:06:09.841 --> 00:06:11.430
infinite plane?
 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.185
Can you calculate the force of
attraction between the charge

00:06:15.185 --> 00:06:17.350
you have and the infinite plane?
 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.771
You know there's going to be
attraction because your charge I

00:06:19.771 --> 00:06:21.750
take to be positive,
and this has got negative.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.970
They'll attract.
 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.610
What is the attraction?
 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.119
These are all well-defined
questions and they exist no

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:28.540
matter what this is made of.
 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:34.149
But for this infinite plane,
we can actually answer it

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:37.226
So we answer by the following
device, which is what I was

00:06:37.226 --> 00:06:38.930
trying to tell you last time.
 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.093
If you take that infinite
plane, your conditions are that

00:06:43.093 --> 00:06:47.702
it should be at 0 potential and
to the left of it should be the

00:06:47.702 --> 00:06:50.230
charge q that I put in.
 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.149
These are the requirements.
 

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:55.480
So you dream up another problem.
 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.810
That's a charge -q,
same distance d from

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:00.709
this one.
 

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:02.000
Take out the plane.
 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.550
Forget the plane now.
 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.211
Think of a new problem,
and -q,

00:07:06.211 --> 00:07:09.089
and you've done that many,
many times.

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:12.290
The lines go like this.
 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.009
And you know that on the
perpendicular bisector,

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:16.803
the lines will be
perpendicular,

00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:18.944
because the potential
everywhere is 0,

00:07:18.944 --> 00:07:19.639
right?
 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:22.297
Potential is a scaler and
whatever this guy does,

00:07:22.297 --> 00:07:24.898
that will do - of that,
because it's at the same

00:07:24.898 --> 00:07:26.670
distance, but has -q.
 

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.130
So V is 0,
so E will be

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:31.670
perpendicular.
 

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.666
Now if you take that
arrangement and look what's

00:07:34.666 --> 00:07:38.238
happening to the left of the
plane, it looks like exactly

00:07:38.238 --> 00:07:40.279
what we want in our problem.
 

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:43.406
What we demand in our problem
is in this part of the universe

00:07:43.406 --> 00:07:45.762
where I live,
there should be charge

00:07:45.762 --> 00:07:49.709
q, there should be
infinite plane at 0 potential.

00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:52.913
That condition is satisfied by
this field configuration in the

00:07:52.913 --> 00:07:53.860
following sense.
 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.744
Start with this configuration
and stick in the infinite plane,

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:03.468
but give it the charge it needs
to terminate all these field

00:08:03.468 --> 00:08:04.269
lines.
 

00:08:04.269 --> 00:08:05.410
How much charge will it need?
 

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.370
You can tell right away.
 

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:13.759
What's the total charge on this
plane?

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:17.540
Because all the lines leaving
this have to terminate on this.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.319
You can see it'll be -q.
 

00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:23.036
It won't be point charge;
it'll be spread out,

00:08:23.036 --> 00:08:24.360
but you need -q on this.
 

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.333
So what we say is,
if you brought the plane in and

00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:31.819
either you give it -q in
advance,

00:08:31.819 --> 00:08:34.845
or you connected it to the
ground, in which case it will

00:08:34.845 --> 00:08:36.330
itself suck up -q.
 

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:40.515
It'll form this configuration
here, so the infinite plane is

00:08:40.515 --> 00:08:44.561
able to remain where it is
without disturbing the solution

00:08:44.561 --> 00:08:45.908
to the problem.
 

00:08:45.908 --> 00:08:48.792
Therefore the answer to the
original question of what

00:08:48.792 --> 00:08:52.283
happens when you put a q
in front of an infinite plane is

00:08:52.283 --> 00:08:54.889
that as far as you're on the
left of this,

00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:58.303
you can compute anything you
want by taking q and the

00:08:58.303 --> 00:09:01.048
image charge,
-q.

00:09:01.048 --> 00:09:05.784
The field the two of them will
produce will be exactly the

00:09:05.784 --> 00:09:10.769
field this guy and all these
induced charges will produce.

00:09:10.769 --> 00:09:15.364
So this is a way of taking a
solution for a simple problem

00:09:15.364 --> 00:09:19.009
with an equipotential,
sticking a conductor into the

00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:21.548
equipotential,
and giving it the right charge.

00:09:21.548 --> 00:09:27.504
Then the problem of a charge in
front of a conductor is thereby

00:09:27.504 --> 00:09:28.370
solved.
 

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.306
Now there are some mathematical
theorems--I don't have time to

00:09:31.306 --> 00:09:33.279
prove but they're not too hard
in fact.

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:36.389
I thought of lecturing on that,
but there isn't enough time--

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:39.743
that show that if you can find
one answer that has the right

00:09:39.743 --> 00:09:42.129
behavior at the boundary of the
region,

00:09:42.129 --> 00:09:43.629
that has got the charges in the
right place,

00:09:43.629 --> 00:09:45.610
is the only answer.
 

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:46.860
Yes.
 

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.085
Student:  Is the -q
evenly distributed across

00:09:49.085 --> 00:09:49.529
the plate?
 

00:09:49.529 --> 00:09:50.220
Prof: Let us ask.
 

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.918
Where is the -q, right?
 

00:09:52.918 --> 00:09:55.971
We know that it's got to be
-q because these lines

00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:57.169
are all ending here.
 

00:09:57.169 --> 00:09:58.629
But what's your intuition?
 

00:09:58.629 --> 00:10:00.950
Where do you think it will be?
 

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.009
You think it'll be evenly
distributed?

00:10:04.009 --> 00:10:05.379
Pardon me?
 

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:07.480
Student:  I don't think
so.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.409
Prof: Where will it be?
 

00:10:11.409 --> 00:10:12.610
What's your feeling?
 

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:13.879
Student:  Probably more
towards the middle.

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:16.826
Prof: Yeah,
more towards in front of this

00:10:16.826 --> 00:10:18.769
guy, and less when you go up.
 

00:10:18.769 --> 00:10:21.340
Now we can actually calculate
that quantity.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.442
We can tell you exactly how
much it will be by the following

00:10:25.442 --> 00:10:28.990
trick - we agree that to the
region to the left,

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:32.928
this charge is able to fake the
effect of all these charges.

00:10:32.928 --> 00:10:34.080
That's why it's called a mirror
charge.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.392
When you stand in front of a
mirror, you are here and there

00:10:38.392 --> 00:10:40.918
is another person in the mirror.
 

00:10:40.918 --> 00:10:45.681
And the light bouncing off and
coming here looks like it's

00:10:45.681 --> 00:10:47.769
coming from this image.
 

00:10:47.769 --> 00:10:50.807
So to the left of the mirror,
either you can talk about you

00:10:50.807 --> 00:10:54.056
and the mirror and the reflected
light, or forget the reflected

00:10:54.056 --> 00:10:54.580
light.
 

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.048
It's as if there's another
person behind the mirror.

00:10:58.048 --> 00:11:01.513
Of course, you know there is no
other person behind the mirror,

00:11:01.513 --> 00:11:01.960
right?
 

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.460
I don't want to be the one to
break that news.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.269
There isn't.
 

00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:08.190
But as far as this side is
concerned,

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.558
it's a lot easier to draw a
line from the mirror,

00:11:10.558 --> 00:11:12.836
because that will simulate the
effect of what's happening

00:11:12.836 --> 00:11:13.690
through the mirror.
 

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.182
Similarly, as long as you are
interested only in the left of

00:11:17.182 --> 00:11:19.370
this region,
you cannot tell the difference

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.668
between the infinite plane with
its induced charge,

00:11:21.668 --> 00:11:25.337
and this guy,
versus this guy and just one

00:11:25.337 --> 00:11:26.678
other charge.
 

00:11:26.678 --> 00:11:30.220
Another question was,
where is the charge and how is

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.399
it distributed?
 

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:34.480
You agree that if you knew the
electric field here,

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.830
you can find the charge
density, because if you draw a

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.168
little Gaussian surface like
that,

00:11:40.168 --> 00:11:43.751
then we know the
σ/ε_0 is

00:11:43.751 --> 00:11:45.320
the electric field.
 

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.408
So if you know the electric
field, you can find sigma,

00:11:47.408 --> 00:11:51.246
and I find the electric field
very simply by saying that's the

00:11:51.246 --> 00:11:55.740
repulsion from this q,
there's an attraction from that

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:56.538
q.
 

00:11:56.538 --> 00:11:58.504
If you add the two,
you get the sum,

00:11:58.504 --> 00:12:00.918
which I can calculate,
a very simple sum.

00:12:00.918 --> 00:12:03.058
It's the contribution from two
point charges.

00:12:03.058 --> 00:12:06.089
You can calculate it as a
function of this angle here or

00:12:06.089 --> 00:12:09.337
as the function of the distance
here, and that will tell you

00:12:09.337 --> 00:12:10.440
what σ is.
 

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.168
And it will have the property
you expect.

00:12:12.168 --> 00:12:15.582
It'll be largely in front of
this guy and will vanish very

00:12:15.582 --> 00:12:17.860
quickly when you move away from
him.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:23.515
If you integrate that surface
charge density over the plane,

00:12:23.515 --> 00:12:26.678
you will in fact get -q.
 

00:12:26.678 --> 00:12:29.057
So you've answered some of the
questions, namely,

00:12:29.057 --> 00:12:32.178
how will the charge distribute
itself on this infinite plane?

00:12:32.178 --> 00:12:36.418
Next thing you can ask is,
what's the force of attraction

00:12:36.418 --> 00:12:38.840
between this one and this one?
 

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.990
Now, is it really the same as
this one and this one?

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.836
The answer is yes,
and the reason is the following

00:12:45.836 --> 00:12:47.932
- in this region,
for example,

00:12:47.932 --> 00:12:51.909
the field is due to this guy,
and due to all these,

00:12:51.909 --> 00:12:55.350
but that's the same as this guy
and this guy.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.850
This one of course doesn't
respond to its own field.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.139
It responds to the field of all
of these.

00:13:00.139 --> 00:13:03.602
But all of these precisely have
the same field to the left as

00:13:03.602 --> 00:13:06.201
this one charge,
therefore this will be pulled

00:13:06.201 --> 00:13:07.759
towards the one charge.
 

00:13:07.759 --> 00:13:09.576
It thinks it's falling towards
the other charge,

00:13:09.576 --> 00:13:11.509
but it's not actually falling
towards the plane.

00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:14.878
And the force will be q
times -q over

00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:17.504
4Πε
_0 times

00:13:17.504 --> 00:13:18.919
2d, right?
 

00:13:18.919 --> 00:13:21.210
That's the force of attraction.
 

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.215
It will be
−q^(2)/4

00:13:23.215 --> 00:13:25.610
Πε
_0,

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.409
the distance between them is
2d,

00:13:27.409 --> 00:13:29.918
so you can calculate that too.
 

00:13:29.918 --> 00:13:32.476
Normally it's a difficult
problem, because the image

00:13:32.476 --> 00:13:35.535
charge reduces the problem of a
very complex conductor to that

00:13:35.535 --> 00:13:36.639
of a point charge.
 

00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:37.389
Yes?
 

00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:38.360
Student:  Shouldn't it
be 2d squared?

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:45.639
Prof: Yes, thank you.
 

00:13:45.639 --> 00:13:50.097
Then you can also ask,
what is the energy it takes to

00:13:50.097 --> 00:13:54.395
assemble this distribution,
starting from this one at

00:13:54.395 --> 00:13:59.024
infinity and this one here,
and if you integrate this

00:13:59.024 --> 00:14:03.750
force, you can do the integral
and you'll find

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:07.634
−q^(2)/4
Πε

00:14:07.634 --> 00:14:12.360
_0 divided by
4d.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.408
That will be the energy.
 

00:14:14.408 --> 00:14:16.730
Na�vely, you may have thought
it should be

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.080
(q^(2)/4Πε
_0)2d,

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.049
because 2d is the
distance between them,

00:14:24.049 --> 00:14:27.908
but it's only half as much.
 

00:14:27.908 --> 00:14:31.202
It's half as much because if in
real life you had a and a

00:14:31.202 --> 00:14:33.730
-q and you brought them
together,

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.812
you will be exerting forces on
both of them and calculating the

00:14:36.812 --> 00:14:37.408
work done.
 

00:14:37.408 --> 00:14:41.193
But in this actual example of
an infinite plane,

00:14:41.193 --> 00:14:45.784
you only do work on this guy,
therefore the answer will be

00:14:45.784 --> 00:14:46.509
half.
 

00:14:46.509 --> 00:14:48.990
So not everything is the same.
 

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.245
For example,
the energy in the

00:14:50.245 --> 00:14:52.958
electromagnetic field,
which I'll tell you about later

00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.269
today,
will be half as much as before,

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:59.730
because in the fake problem,
the energy is here and here.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:03.480
In the real problem,
the field is non-zero only

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.029
here, but 0 here.
 

00:15:05.029 --> 00:15:06.250
Yes?
 

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:09.788
Student:  For the
potential energy,

00:15:09.788 --> 00:15:13.070
is it 1 over 4d or 1
over...?

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.863
Prof: You would think
it's 1 over 2d,

00:15:14.863 --> 00:15:15.149
right?
 

00:15:15.149 --> 00:15:16.038
Student:  Yes.
 

00:15:16.038 --> 00:15:17.740
Prof: But I'm telling
you it's 1 over 4d.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:25.240
Student:  Because when
you take the integral,

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.592
you have 2 on...
 

00:15:27.592 --> 00:15:28.769
okay.
 

00:15:28.769 --> 00:15:30.129
Prof: All right.
 

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:36.977
Now what if this plane was not
grounded, it's a standalone

00:15:36.977 --> 00:15:37.940
plane?
 

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.029
So let's not take it to be
infinite in this problem.

00:15:40.029 --> 00:15:42.379
It's 1 million miles in radius,
huge disc.

00:15:42.379 --> 00:15:43.860
You bring the charge in.
 

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.690
What's it supposed to do?
 

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.690
It cannot suddenly acquire a
negative charge.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:52.451
Charge conservation says you
only have the charge you have,

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:53.360
which was 0.
 

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.455
So what do you think you will
do if you have that infinite

00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:56.889
plane?
 

00:15:56.889 --> 00:16:02.710
You have to remain at some
potential.

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:03.658
Yes?
 

00:16:03.658 --> 00:16:05.850
Student:  Push positive
charges out?

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.450
Prof: It will split into
positive and negative charges.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.928
Let's see what to do with the
positive charges in a minute.

00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:14.303
The negative charges,
it will arrange exactly the way

00:16:14.303 --> 00:16:16.639
it wants to in this problem,
okay?

00:16:16.639 --> 00:16:22.009
That takes care of this being
at a constant potential of 0.

00:16:22.009 --> 00:16:25.285
But it's got an equal number of
positive charges,

00:16:25.285 --> 00:16:28.494
which you've got to dump on
this infinite plane,

00:16:28.494 --> 00:16:31.428
without ruining the constant
potential.

00:16:31.428 --> 00:16:35.678
The way to do that is to put it
uniformly on this plane.

00:16:35.678 --> 00:16:38.721
If you spread it uniformly on
the plane, you don't destroy the

00:16:38.721 --> 00:16:39.970
equal potential nature.
 

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:43.129
But it turns out that field
will be very,

00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:44.629
very, very small.
 

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:48.341
It will be very small,
because you're taking a charge

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:51.553
q and you're putting it
on a huge disc,

00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:53.980
like the radius of the galaxy.
 

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.782
That's the charge density and
that over ε_0

00:16:57.782 --> 00:16:59.620
will be the electric field.
 

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.950
You can see that that can be
made vanishingly small.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.792
So the infinite plane,
basically you borrow from

00:17:06.792 --> 00:17:09.880
somewhere a positive charge and
negative charge,

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.250
and you put the negative in
this particular arrangement.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.019
Positive is smeared over the
whole thing uniformly.

00:17:15.019 --> 00:17:17.756
It is so dilute,
because of the size of it,

00:17:17.756 --> 00:17:19.058
it doesn't matter.
 

00:17:19.058 --> 00:17:23.034
But it principle,
that amount of positive charge

00:17:23.034 --> 00:17:25.740
will be a background constant.
 

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.578
That way the infinite plane
will be a little strange,

00:17:27.578 --> 00:17:30.714
because you don't see the
richness of the phenomenon of

00:17:30.714 --> 00:17:34.082
the infinite plane because it
can basically create negative

00:17:34.082 --> 00:17:37.450
charge and not fully account for
the positive charge,

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.170
because it's smeared over a
huge distance.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:44.910
So a problem that's more
interesting would be this one.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:51.830
I take a sphere of radius
a, it's a conducting

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.029
sphere.
 

00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:57.859
And after distance b,
I put a charge q.

00:17:57.859 --> 00:18:00.710
What will happen now?
 

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.364
Again, now let me say this is a
grounded sphere,

00:18:03.364 --> 00:18:05.509
meaning it's connected to the
earth.

00:18:05.509 --> 00:18:08.640
It's maintained at 0 potential.
 

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.055
So it's not very different from
the plane, except you've got a

00:18:11.055 --> 00:18:12.798
huge sphere now instead of an
infinite plane,

00:18:12.798 --> 00:18:13.588
but it's finite.
 

00:18:13.588 --> 00:18:20.142
You come around from infinity,
you can see that some negative

00:18:20.142 --> 00:18:27.240
charges will be induced on this,
and some lines will come here.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.868
And some lines may go past like
this.

00:18:30.868 --> 00:18:34.602
Because this is a finite
sphere, not every line has to

00:18:34.602 --> 00:18:35.798
terminate here.
 

00:18:35.798 --> 00:18:38.824
Now the question is,
what will be the charge

00:18:38.824 --> 00:18:39.880
distribution?
 

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.199
How will it arrange itself,
and what will be the surface

00:18:44.199 --> 00:18:46.318
electric field and so on?
 

00:18:46.318 --> 00:18:49.920
That's what you want to
calculate?

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.088
So what kind of problem do you
think we should try to solve?

00:18:54.088 --> 00:19:01.259
If it had an easy solution,
what form do you think it will

00:19:01.259 --> 00:19:02.140
take?
 

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.380
Yes?
 

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.961
Student:  You could put
a charge on the other side of

00:19:04.961 --> 00:19:05.308
the sphere?
 

00:19:05.308 --> 00:19:06.960
Prof: Okay,
that's not a bad guess.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.108
If you put a charge on the
other side of the sphere,

00:19:11.108 --> 00:19:14.868
then in the universe in which
you're living,

00:19:14.868 --> 00:19:17.289
namely outside the conductor,
things have changed,

00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:19.440
right?
 

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.622
In the image charge problem,
remember, the fake charge was

00:19:21.622 --> 00:19:22.579
never in your universe.
 

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:23.670
It was outside.
 

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:26.272
The problem you defined
yourself should remain the same

00:19:26.272 --> 00:19:28.442
where you are,
but you can do stuff inside the

00:19:28.442 --> 00:19:30.180
region that's excluded from you.
 

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.430
So you're almost right.
 

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.660
We want to put a charge inside
here.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:39.420
And where do you think you
should put it,

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.608
roughly?
 

00:19:40.608 --> 00:19:43.839
Can you make a guess where in
the sphere it will be?

00:19:43.839 --> 00:19:46.470
Student:  Center?
 

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:49.684
Prof: Center is a good
guess, but it turns out,

00:19:49.684 --> 00:19:53.142
if you put it in the center,
this doesn't turn out to be a

00:19:53.142 --> 00:19:53.808
sphere.
 

00:19:53.808 --> 00:19:56.347
But you agree that it should be
on this line,

00:19:56.347 --> 00:19:57.558
just from symmetry.
 

00:19:57.558 --> 00:19:59.000
You don't want to put it
anywhere else.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.140
So I will give you the answer.
 

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.858
It's not very hard to calculate.
 

00:20:01.858 --> 00:20:07.910
If you put a charge q'
at a distance s,

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:15.028
which is a^(2)/b,
and the size of q' is

00:20:15.028 --> 00:20:19.501
-qa/b,
a/b is less than

00:20:19.501 --> 00:20:19.680
1.
 

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:24.117
So q' is less than
q, and is at a distance

00:20:24.117 --> 00:20:28.880
s from the center,
which is a^(2)/b.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.730
This is something you can do
for fun.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.992
You can go and calculate now
the potential of this negative

00:20:33.992 --> 00:20:37.424
and smaller charge together with
this positive charge q

00:20:37.424 --> 00:20:40.560
and you will find,
if you put q'/r

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.800
for that,
and q/r for this

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.948
guy,
it will be exactly 0 on this

00:20:44.948 --> 00:20:50.038
sphere,
centered here.

00:20:50.038 --> 00:20:54.541
So it's another fortunate thing
that you can get a spherical

00:20:54.541 --> 00:20:58.130
equipotential by taking two
unequal charges--

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.019
not two equal,
two unequal charges--

00:21:00.019 --> 00:21:03.400
and putting it slightly off
center by this amount.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.828
Let's not do the algebra now.
 

00:21:04.828 --> 00:21:07.875
You can all imagine doing
q'/r' and you'll

00:21:07.875 --> 00:21:10.088
find it's equal to
q/r,

00:21:10.088 --> 00:21:12.440
up to a sign,
and therefore it will be in

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.248
fact--
you can always make two things

00:21:14.248 --> 00:21:17.037
cancel at one point,
but they cancel over an entire

00:21:17.037 --> 00:21:17.519
sphere.
 

00:21:17.519 --> 00:21:19.299
It's very amazing, but true.
 

00:21:19.299 --> 00:21:20.450
Yes?
 

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.510
Student:  Are the field
lines always perpendicular to

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:23.490
the surface of the sphere?
 

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.279
Prof: They must end up
perpendicular.

00:21:25.279 --> 00:21:28.960
Tell me why.
 

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.650
Can they end up anything but
perpendicular to a conductor?

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.038
Student:  Oh, right, no.
 

00:21:34.038 --> 00:21:35.665
Prof: No,
because if it's got a

00:21:35.665 --> 00:21:37.598
tangential part,
it will move the charges.

00:21:37.598 --> 00:21:39.968
So charges, once they've come
to equilibrium,

00:21:39.968 --> 00:21:43.144
the only force you can apply to
a conductor is normal to the

00:21:43.144 --> 00:21:43.788
surface.
 

00:21:43.788 --> 00:21:47.788
So the lines will terminate in
the normal way.

00:21:47.788 --> 00:21:51.477
So the problem you want to
solve, the fake problem,

00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:54.796
the image problem,
is a −q' and a

00:21:54.796 --> 00:21:57.818
q so located you get a
sphere.

00:21:57.818 --> 00:22:01.069
Now you go and say,
let me take another problem of

00:22:01.069 --> 00:22:02.529
a conducting sphere.
 

00:22:02.529 --> 00:22:05.028
There's nothing in it, grounded.
 

00:22:05.028 --> 00:22:09.086
What it will do is suck from
the ground this charge and

00:22:09.086 --> 00:22:13.068
spread it exactly the way you
want in this problem.

00:22:13.068 --> 00:22:16.359
And then it will come to 0
potential.

00:22:16.359 --> 00:22:19.450
So ground is here, 0 potential.
 

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:22.577
If you want to know,
what is the electrostatic

00:22:22.577 --> 00:22:26.328
potential there in this problem,
we can do that now.

00:22:26.328 --> 00:22:28.868
What's the electrostatic
potential here?

00:22:28.868 --> 00:22:34.134
It is due to this guy at that
distance and the fake charge at

00:22:34.134 --> 00:22:35.538
that distance.
 

00:22:35.538 --> 00:22:37.650
You should add them with the
proper sign.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:41.182
So the problem of the field due
to very complicated distribution

00:22:41.182 --> 00:22:44.210
of charges on a conducting
sphere and a point charge is

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:46.788
reduced to the problem of 2
point charges.

00:22:46.788 --> 00:22:50.799
Very easy to add their
potentials, take the derivative

00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:52.390
and find the field.
 

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.542
If you want to know the surface
charge density,

00:22:54.542 --> 00:22:56.650
you find the electric field at
the surface.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.608
It will come out to be
perpendicular.

00:22:58.608 --> 00:23:01.558
Then
σ/ε_0 =

00:23:01.558 --> 00:23:04.681
E, therefore if you knew
E in magnitude,

00:23:04.681 --> 00:23:08.272
you can find sigma and you can
find the charge distribution on

00:23:08.272 --> 00:23:09.509
the whole sphere.
 

00:23:09.509 --> 00:23:16.683
If you integrate that guy,
what will you get for the

00:23:16.683 --> 00:23:21.890
charge distribution on the
surface?

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:25.660
What should it give for the
total charge?

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.640
Pardon me?
 

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:33.380
Use Gauss's law for the real
problem and the fake problem.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:36.792
In the real problem,
surface integral of E is

00:23:36.792 --> 00:23:38.598
the charge on the sphere.
 

00:23:38.598 --> 00:23:41.499
But the same E is
produced in this combination

00:23:41.499 --> 00:23:42.670
with this guy here.
 

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.548
The surface integral of
E is a charge enclosed,

00:23:45.548 --> 00:23:47.828
which is q',
after some epsilons.

00:23:47.828 --> 00:23:50.652
Therefore the charge on the
sphere will turn out to be

00:23:50.652 --> 00:23:52.568
exactly the same as the
q'.

00:23:52.568 --> 00:23:55.810
Just like in the plane,
there'll be some negative

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:59.729
charge, but it's spread out in a
particular way and you can

00:23:59.729 --> 00:24:00.808
verify that.
 

00:24:00.808 --> 00:24:05.296
Now a more interesting question
is, what if this is not

00:24:05.296 --> 00:24:06.210
grounded?
 

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.810
In other words,
it's an isolated sphere and

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:10.980
you're bringing a charge near
it.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.964
It wants a certain negative
charge to spread on the surface

00:24:13.964 --> 00:24:16.589
to produce a zero potential
here, but you don't have

00:24:16.589 --> 00:24:17.619
negative charge.
 

00:24:17.619 --> 00:24:18.920
You have zero charge.
 

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.078
So what will you do if you are
that sphere?

00:24:21.078 --> 00:24:25.558
You will say 0 = q'
-q'.

00:24:25.558 --> 00:24:28.240
You would split into q'
and −q'.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.692
The q' will arrange
itself on the sphere to exactly

00:24:31.692 --> 00:24:33.509
terminate these field lines.
 

00:24:33.509 --> 00:24:37.368
The only difference is,
now you've got a charge,

00:24:37.368 --> 00:24:39.338
-q', left over.
 

00:24:39.338 --> 00:24:42.073
You have to spread it around
and you don't want to screw up

00:24:42.073 --> 00:24:44.759
the equal potential nature of
the sphere by doing that.

00:24:44.759 --> 00:24:47.348
You can all guess what you
should do.

00:24:47.348 --> 00:24:52.250
You should spread it uniformly
on that sphere.

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:54.707
So it will contain negative
charge distribution,

00:24:54.707 --> 00:24:57.583
which is biased in this
direction, and a positive charge

00:24:57.583 --> 00:24:59.568
distribution that's uniform in
it.

00:24:59.568 --> 00:25:02.650
Then the three of them
together, this one,

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:05.362
the positive charge,
I put here of −q'

00:25:05.362 --> 00:25:08.837
and this one,
three of them together will

00:25:08.837 --> 00:25:12.798
keep the sphere at a constant
potential.

00:25:12.798 --> 00:25:17.130
The potential it ends up with
will however not be 0,

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:20.220
because q' and
q made it 0,

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.430
but you have a −q'
at the center,

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:24.276
therefore you must find the
potential due to

00:25:24.276 --> 00:25:26.380
−q' on the surface
of the sphere,

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.828
which is that.
 

00:25:28.828 --> 00:25:33.440
That's the potential to which
the sphere will come.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.180
So we have answered many
questions.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.401
We have said if you bring a
charge q near the

00:25:37.401 --> 00:25:39.118
sphere, what potential will it
acquire?

00:25:39.118 --> 00:25:42.259
It will acquire exactly this
potential.

00:25:42.259 --> 00:25:44.548
You can predict the charge on
the sphere.

00:25:44.548 --> 00:25:50.132
You can predict the force of
attraction between this and that

00:25:50.132 --> 00:25:50.970
sphere.
 

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:51.769
How?
 

00:25:51.769 --> 00:25:54.486
Because the field that this one
feels generally,

00:25:54.486 --> 00:25:57.896
the field at any point is due
to this one, this one and this

00:25:57.896 --> 00:25:58.358
one.
 

00:25:58.358 --> 00:26:01.391
But if you want the force on
this one, if you'd only find the

00:26:01.391 --> 00:26:03.108
field due to the other two guys.
 

00:26:03.108 --> 00:26:05.875
But the other two guys,
namely the sphere with all the

00:26:05.875 --> 00:26:07.962
charges on it,
is simply equal to 2 point

00:26:07.962 --> 00:26:08.588
charges.
 

00:26:08.588 --> 00:26:10.890
So you must find the force
between these 2,

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:13.792
add to that the force between
these two and you'll get

00:26:13.792 --> 00:26:14.559
something.
 

00:26:14.559 --> 00:26:19.380
That will be the force.
 

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:22.131
It will be a force of
attraction, but you can actually

00:26:22.131 --> 00:26:22.910
calculate it.
 

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:28.365
This is the trick by which you
can solve a variety of problems

00:26:28.365 --> 00:26:32.390
by finding equal potentials of
nice shapes.

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.137
Maybe one will be a nice
ellipsoid, because if it is an

00:26:35.137 --> 00:26:37.480
ellipsoid, you can stick an
ellipsoid there.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.740
And inside the ellipsoid will
be the image charge.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.865
And if the ellipsoid is
grounded, you'll get whatever

00:26:43.865 --> 00:26:46.328
charge is needed to maintain
that at 0.

00:26:46.328 --> 00:26:48.798
If it's not grounded,
it will split into positive and

00:26:48.798 --> 00:26:50.801
negative charges,
where the negative will

00:26:50.801 --> 00:26:52.923
distribute this way,
and the positive will

00:26:52.923 --> 00:26:57.182
distribute itself in some way,
so that the potential is a

00:26:57.182 --> 00:26:58.170
constant.
 

00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:03.038
For a sphere,
we know what that some way is,

00:27:03.038 --> 00:27:05.190
which is uniform.
 

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:08.700
So the reason I took some time
to describe this is that

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.730
problems are not always finding
the potential due to a bunch of

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:13.509
charges.
 

00:27:13.509 --> 00:27:16.461
That's the easiest problem,
but more generally you are

00:27:16.461 --> 00:27:19.580
asked, if you're given a set of
conductors and a bunch of

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.028
charges, what happens?
 

00:27:21.028 --> 00:27:22.828
If the conductors have a nice
shape,

00:27:22.828 --> 00:27:25.818
like a sphere or a plane,
or certain solids of

00:27:25.818 --> 00:27:29.070
revolution,
we can appeal to a different

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:32.470
problem with image charges and
solve it.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:36.540
Now there's a wonderful theorem
that says if you get a solution

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.838
this way, it's the only
solution.

00:27:38.838 --> 00:27:40.461
In other words,
there's a theorem,

00:27:40.461 --> 00:27:42.279
which I'm not going to write
down,

00:27:42.279 --> 00:27:46.390
which says if in all of space
that you're interested in,

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:48.848
or at least in a region bounded
by something,

00:27:48.848 --> 00:27:51.806
if you know the potential of
the boundary and you've got a

00:27:51.806 --> 00:27:54.797
whole bunch of conductors,
each one at a known potential,

00:27:54.797 --> 00:27:56.880
and you've got a whole bunch of
charges,

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.328
there can be only one potential
function,

00:27:59.328 --> 00:28:01.650
V(r),
in this whole region.

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.298
You cannot have two answers.
 

00:28:03.298 --> 00:28:05.970
There's only one answer to that
question.

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:07.728
In other words,
the potential is completely

00:28:07.728 --> 00:28:09.778
determined by knowing the charge
distribution,

00:28:09.778 --> 00:28:14.151
and the potential on the
various conductors you stick

00:28:14.151 --> 00:28:15.160
into that.
 

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.098
They don't all have to be to 0.
 

00:28:17.098 --> 00:28:19.175
This can be at 5 volts,
this can be at 9 volts,

00:28:19.175 --> 00:28:20.348
this can be at 13 volts.
 

00:28:20.348 --> 00:28:23.027
This can be 1 coulomb,
2 coulombs, 3 coulombs,

00:28:23.027 --> 00:28:23.920
-10 coulombs.
 

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.979
This is say this sphere at
infinity of 0 potential,

00:28:26.979 --> 00:28:28.568
there's only one answer.
 

00:28:28.568 --> 00:28:30.298
It's called the uniqueness
theorem,

00:28:30.298 --> 00:28:32.509
which is why,
if you can find some way to

00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:34.608
fudge the answer in a given
region,

00:28:34.608 --> 00:28:40.170
which is completely specified,
that is the answer.

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:44.637
So that is the interlude on
metallic objects called

00:28:44.637 --> 00:28:45.798
conductors.
 

00:28:45.798 --> 00:28:50.907
Now I'm going to go to the
other problem that I did towards

00:28:50.907 --> 00:28:54.960
the end, which is the notion of
a capacitor.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:02.900
So if you take two blobs of
metal, they are both neutral.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.400
Then you grab maybe a coulomb
from this and stick it there,

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.598
so that becomes positive and
this becomes negative.

00:29:09.598 --> 00:29:12.548
Then you want to take more,
you take more stuff,

00:29:12.548 --> 00:29:14.578
you can see that you're going
to run into resistance,

00:29:14.578 --> 00:29:17.140
because these guys are getting
positively charged.

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.038
They don't want more positive
charges.

00:29:19.038 --> 00:29:21.510
Meanwhile the negative charge
you leave behind wants it to

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:23.420
come back, so you're working
against that.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.750
But you do some work and you
start pumping charge into this.

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:29.906
So in the end,
suppose you have a charge

00:29:29.906 --> 00:29:33.470
Q there and charge
-Q there.

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:36.432
Then there will be a potential
energy difference between the

00:29:36.432 --> 00:29:39.546
two, because there's a certain
amount of work needed to go from

00:29:39.546 --> 00:29:40.450
here to there.
 

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:42.782
The potential difference is a
unique number,

00:29:42.782 --> 00:29:45.875
because the whole solid has one
potential, other solid has

00:29:45.875 --> 00:29:47.068
another potential.
 

00:29:47.068 --> 00:29:49.296
No matter where you start and
where you end,

00:29:49.296 --> 00:29:52.093
if you find the work done,
that potential difference we

00:29:52.093 --> 00:29:53.440
like to call V.
 

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:58.173
Therefore V is always
going to be proportional to

00:29:58.173 --> 00:30:03.423
Q and the constants of
proportionality we like to write

00:30:03.423 --> 00:30:06.778
downstairs and call it
capacitance.

00:30:06.778 --> 00:30:10.890
So that's the ability of the
system to hold charge.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:15.488
If you've got any two metal
containers, you can store energy

00:30:15.488 --> 00:30:18.916
by drawing the charges from one
to the other,

00:30:18.916 --> 00:30:20.710
putting them there.
 

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:24.896
I did calculate the capacitance
for a very simple system and I'm

00:30:24.896 --> 00:30:28.817
going to stick to the simple
system because we don't want to

00:30:28.817 --> 00:30:30.680
get lost in the details.
 

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:35.394
It's the parallel plate
capacitor in which I put some

00:30:35.394 --> 00:30:40.833
charge Q on the upper
plate and -Q on the lower

00:30:40.833 --> 00:30:41.740
plate.
 

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.910
Someone says,
what's the capacitance of the

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:45.588
system?
 

00:30:45.588 --> 00:30:49.238
For that, you must find the
voltage difference between the

00:30:49.238 --> 00:30:52.950
two plates, and you want to take
Q over V.

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:56.228
Now there's going to be an
electric field here,

00:30:56.228 --> 00:30:59.577
E, which is
σ/ε_0

00:30:59.577 --> 00:31:00.858
pointing down.
 

00:31:00.858 --> 00:31:03.762
So the voltages difference will
be the electric field times the

00:31:03.762 --> 00:31:06.480
distance, because that's what
the line integral will be.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.778
That's the distance between the
plates.

00:31:10.778 --> 00:31:18.108
And σ is
Q/A.

00:31:18.108 --> 00:31:21.212
Now in a real capacitor,
near the ends there'll be some

00:31:21.212 --> 00:31:22.190
funny business.
 

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:25.262
It's not going to be simply
like this, but we take it to be

00:31:25.262 --> 00:31:28.549
so large in this extent that the
edge effects are neglected.

00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:30.650
Then this formula is valid.
 

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:33.979
Then you can compare it to
Q/C and you can

00:31:33.979 --> 00:31:36.159
see C is
ε_0

00:31:36.159 --> 00:31:39.851
a/d. So this is
what I have done towards the end

00:31:39.851 --> 00:31:40.759
of class.
 

00:31:40.759 --> 00:31:44.480
That's the capacitance of that.
 

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.213
Once again, you can talk about
capacitance, but you cannot

00:31:47.213 --> 00:31:48.269
always calculate it.
 

00:31:48.269 --> 00:31:50.689
You can take two irregular
metallic objects and in

00:31:50.689 --> 00:31:52.960
principle for a transfer of
charge q.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.558
There will be a voltage
v, and the ratio is the

00:31:55.558 --> 00:31:57.568
capacitance, but you cannot
compute it.

00:31:57.568 --> 00:32:01.273
But for a parallel plate
geometry, or another one I did

00:32:01.273 --> 00:32:05.460
in class near the end,
you take two concentric spheres

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:09.933
and put some charge on this one,
maybe and - on that one,

00:32:09.933 --> 00:32:14.420
you all know how to find the
field in the region in between.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.142
You can integrate it and you
can find the potential

00:32:17.142 --> 00:32:17.848
difference.
 

00:32:17.848 --> 00:32:20.891
And then you can see it is
proportional to Q,

00:32:20.891 --> 00:32:23.992
and you take the ratio,
you'll get the capacitance of

00:32:23.992 --> 00:32:24.528
that.
 

00:32:24.528 --> 00:32:28.259
Now the point,
one thing I want to calculate,

00:32:28.259 --> 00:32:30.750
which also I think I started
doing is,

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:37.368
if I take a capacitor and I
charge it,

00:32:37.368 --> 00:32:40.788
from 0 to some charge
Q_0,

00:32:40.788 --> 00:32:47.048
what's the total amount of
energy stored in the capacitor?

00:32:47.048 --> 00:32:50.608
So the way I think about it is,
I take some intermediate

00:32:50.608 --> 00:32:54.362
situation, when there's a charge
Q on the capacitor,

00:32:54.362 --> 00:32:55.980
not the final amount.
 

00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:01.925
Then I want to take a little
amount of charge dQ and I

00:33:01.925 --> 00:33:07.078
want to move it from the
negative to the positive.

00:33:07.078 --> 00:33:10.412
Since at that stage the
potential difference is

00:33:10.412 --> 00:33:14.830
Q/C that potential
difference times dQ is

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:16.278
the work you do.
 

00:33:16.278 --> 00:33:18.557
That's the definition of
potential difference,

00:33:18.557 --> 00:33:21.643
how much work it takes to move
a coulomb from one plate to the

00:33:21.643 --> 00:33:22.150
other.
 

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:24.807
If you're moving dQ
coulombs, that's the work you

00:33:24.807 --> 00:33:25.048
do.
 

00:33:25.048 --> 00:33:29.011
You integrate that from 0 to
some maximum value

00:33:29.011 --> 00:33:32.114
Q_0,
you see you get

00:33:32.114 --> 00:33:35.558
Q_0
^(2)/2C.

00:33:35.558 --> 00:33:38.650
So the energy in a capacitor is
q^(2)/2C.

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:40.450
Forget the 0, subscript 0.
 

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:45.558
Usually Q stands for the
charge of a capacitor.

00:33:45.558 --> 00:33:47.740
But you can also write it in
another way.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:52.365
Since Q = CV,
you can write it as

00:33:52.365 --> 00:33:54.880
½CV^(2) .
 

00:33:54.880 --> 00:34:03.868
There are two ways to write the
energy.

00:34:03.868 --> 00:34:09.099
So the energy in the capacitor
is ½CV^(2),

00:34:09.099 --> 00:34:11.568
but I'm going to play with that
expression and get a very

00:34:11.568 --> 00:34:16.030
interesting result,
very profound.

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:18.961
Capacitance is
ε_0

00:34:18.961 --> 00:34:23.269
A/d,
what about the voltage?

00:34:23.269 --> 00:34:26.929
It is E/d.
 

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:29.590
Sorry, voltage E times
d.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:34.880
E squared,
d squared.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:35.869
So what do you get?
 

00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:43.757
You get ε_0
E^(2)/2 times a

00:34:43.757 --> 00:34:46.070
times d.
 

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:49.650
What is A times d?
 

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:54.922
It's a volume of the region
that contains the electric

00:34:54.922 --> 00:34:55.719
field.
 

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:59.405
Before you charge a capacitor,
there is no energy and there is

00:34:59.405 --> 00:35:00.070
no field.
 

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:03.730
Once you charge the capacitor,
you've got a field.

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:06.418
And if you wish,
you can say I've got to ascribe

00:35:06.418 --> 00:35:09.510
that energy to the fact that
it's a non-zero field,

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:12.411
in which case,
this is the energy per unit

00:35:12.411 --> 00:35:15.300
volume,
due to an electric field.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.530
That's a very interesting
notion.

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:22.664
Little u is the energy
per unit volume and that happens

00:35:22.664 --> 00:35:27.190
to be ε_0
E^(2)/2.

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:29.728
In other words,
it takes energy to establish

00:35:29.728 --> 00:35:30.969
the electric field.
 

00:35:30.969 --> 00:35:33.282
So in this room,
if you've go to a tiny region

00:35:33.282 --> 00:35:36.469
where E is essentially
constant over the tiny region.

00:35:36.469 --> 00:35:40.523
ε_0
E^(2)/2 times the tiny

00:35:40.523 --> 00:35:44.010
volume is the energy in that
tiny region.

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:46.027
So once you've got an electric
field, it just cannot just

00:35:46.027 --> 00:35:46.460
disappear.
 

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:49.429
Law of conservation of energy
will require that you account

00:35:49.429 --> 00:35:51.940
for it, and this is the energy
per unit volume.

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:54.570
It turns out to work even if
you've got radio waves,

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:56.869
electromagnetic waves,
going anywhere,

00:35:56.869 --> 00:35:59.284
to take that energy,
electric field squared times

00:35:59.284 --> 00:36:03.510
epsilon over 2,
that's the energy density.

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:07.974
All right, so this is really
the end of what I wanted to

00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:11.789
finish last time,
but I wanted to go back to the

00:36:11.789 --> 00:36:15.280
study of equipotentials and
conductors.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:26.219
But now I am setting the stage
for electrical circuits.

00:36:26.219 --> 00:36:30.101
Now this is the kind of thing
some of you probably did

00:36:30.101 --> 00:36:32.079
somewhere in high school.
 

00:36:32.079 --> 00:36:36.300
So how many people have done
basic circuits in high school?

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.856
So I'm going to assume you've
done some of it,

00:36:38.856 --> 00:36:41.925
so I won't do it in that
detail, but I will mention all

00:36:41.925 --> 00:36:43.289
the essential facts.
 

00:36:43.289 --> 00:36:47.070
For the few of you that didn't
do it, you have a chance to keep

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:48.289
up with the class.
 

00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:52.041
The first thing in electrical
circuits is, you've got some

00:36:52.041 --> 00:36:55.730
wire and you've got an electric
current flowing in it.

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:58.909
We need a description of the
current.

00:36:58.909 --> 00:37:01.159
The current is defined as
follows.

00:37:01.159 --> 00:37:05.068
Imagine this is the perfect
cylinder, cross section

00:37:05.068 --> 00:37:05.929
A.
 

00:37:05.929 --> 00:37:09.538
You cut it somewhere and you
watch all the charges go by,

00:37:09.538 --> 00:37:13.340
and you see the number of
coulombs that go by per second.

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:19.880
That's called the electric
current and is measured in

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.139
amperes.
 

00:37:21.139 --> 00:37:27.369
So 1 coulomb per second is 1
amp.

00:37:27.369 --> 00:37:31.268
All right, now let us ask,
what's the connection between

00:37:31.268 --> 00:37:35.449
the electric current and what's
going on microscopically?

00:37:35.449 --> 00:37:46.929
So let n = number of
carriers per unit volume.

00:37:46.929 --> 00:37:53.949
Let e be the charge of a
carrier.

00:37:53.949 --> 00:37:56.849
Now here is one of the biggest
nuisances in life.

00:37:56.849 --> 00:38:00.710
As you know,
in a wire, the current is

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:03.110
carried by electrons.
 

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:07.628
Because the charge is negative,
when you draw a picture like

00:38:07.628 --> 00:38:12.224
this, the current to the right,
electrons are actually moving

00:38:12.224 --> 00:38:13.449
to the left.
 

00:38:13.449 --> 00:38:16.918
What we will instead do is to
just keep an eye on the

00:38:16.918 --> 00:38:18.719
direction of the current.
 

00:38:18.719 --> 00:38:20.759
You imagine there are
positively charged objects

00:38:20.759 --> 00:38:23.190
carrying the current in the
direction of the current,

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:26.184
whereas in reality,
it's negatively charged objects

00:38:26.184 --> 00:38:30.079
moving in the opposite direction
that produce the same current.

00:38:30.079 --> 00:38:35.282
So you can ask yourself,
if you wait 1 second,

00:38:35.282 --> 00:38:40.949
how many coulombs will go past
this checkpoint?

00:38:40.949 --> 00:38:44.179
You can see that it's a
cylinder whose length is the

00:38:44.179 --> 00:38:47.726
velocity, because in 1 second,
it will have gone v

00:38:47.726 --> 00:38:48.929
times 1 second.
 

00:38:48.929 --> 00:38:52.530
All those guys have crossed the
finish line.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:57.708
Therefore the current will be
A times v (is the

00:38:57.708 --> 00:39:02.358
volume of stuff that's gone),
that's the number of carriers

00:39:02.358 --> 00:39:04.972
in the volume,
that's the charge of each

00:39:04.972 --> 00:39:05.539
carrier.
 

00:39:05.539 --> 00:39:13.860
That's the total current.
 

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:19.512
So we like to define a quantity
called the current density,

00:39:19.512 --> 00:39:23.119
which is the current per unit
area.

00:39:23.119 --> 00:39:30.429
That will be equal to
nev.

00:39:30.429 --> 00:39:34.351
And actually,
current density is a vector so

00:39:34.351 --> 00:39:39.733
if you want, because velocity is
a vector, you can make it a

00:39:39.733 --> 00:39:41.650
vector like that.
 

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:44.489
In this problem,
the current density is uniform.

00:39:44.489 --> 00:39:46.784
In fact, in any wire,
the current here and the

00:39:46.784 --> 00:39:49.489
current there and the current
there do not change,

00:39:49.489 --> 00:39:52.400
because if it changed,
charges will pile up in some

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.030
places like a traffic jam.
 

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.960
Then it will resist it till
this thing evens out.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.849
Current is constant on a wire.
 

00:39:58.849 --> 00:40:01.168
Need not be uniform across a
cross section of the wire,

00:40:01.168 --> 00:40:02.929
but I'm going to take it to be
uniform.

00:40:02.929 --> 00:40:07.867
But if it's not constant,
then you can have a J

00:40:07.867 --> 00:40:12.664
that's varying with space,
so the current crossing that

00:40:12.664 --> 00:40:15.505
surface will be the surface
integral of

00:40:15.505 --> 00:40:18.050
J⋅dA.
 

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:20.065
In other words,
divide that area into tiny

00:40:20.065 --> 00:40:23.014
little patches,
dA, then as we have seen

00:40:23.014 --> 00:40:25.456
many times,
whenever something is flowing,

00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:28.347
it's the dot product of the
flow rate with the area that

00:40:28.347 --> 00:40:29.820
measures the actual flow.
 

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:33.077
You add it over the surface,
that's the current crossing a

00:40:33.077 --> 00:40:33.650
surface.
 

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:35.219
We won't use this formula very
much.

00:40:35.219 --> 00:40:41.190
I'm just mentioning it for
completeness.

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:46.690
All right, so the next question
is, I've told you there is no

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:49.989
electric field inside a
conductor.

00:40:49.989 --> 00:40:53.105
But if you take a resistor,
even a nice thing like copper,

00:40:53.105 --> 00:40:54.800
it's not a perfect conductor.
 

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:59.489
Actually, there's an electric
field inside a conductor.

00:40:59.489 --> 00:41:02.268
That's what makes a current
flow.

00:41:02.268 --> 00:41:06.614
If you want any wire to carry
current, except for ideal wires

00:41:06.614 --> 00:41:10.597
that have no resistance,
any realistic conductor needs a

00:41:10.597 --> 00:41:12.190
field to drive it.
 

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:16.021
The reason is that if you look
microscopically at these

00:41:16.021 --> 00:41:20.210
carriers, they're all going like
crazy in all directions.

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:22.179
That's precisely why they don't
carry a current.

00:41:22.179 --> 00:41:23.579
They don't have a common
direction.

00:41:23.579 --> 00:41:26.380
They're going very fast but
they're going nowhere.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.309
One of these guys is going to
the right.

00:41:27.309 --> 00:41:29.909
For every one going to the
right, there's one to the left,

00:41:29.909 --> 00:41:32.010
one going northeast and one
going southwest.

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:35.820
The velocity all averages out
to 0.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.989
But if you apply an electric
field to the right,

00:41:38.989 --> 00:41:42.190
you can imagine somehow in the
middle of all this chaos,

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:47.139
there'll be an overall tendency
to drift to the right.

00:41:47.139 --> 00:41:50.130
So let's see how much there is.
 

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:53.480
I found that the current
density was nev.

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.989
Forget about the vector sign
now.

00:41:54.989 --> 00:41:58.179
Just everything is along
x.

00:41:58.179 --> 00:42:03.900
I want to find here an average
velocity.

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:08.139
What's going to be the average
velocity over all the particles

00:42:08.139 --> 00:42:09.389
at a given time?
 

00:42:09.389 --> 00:42:11.579
Now here's the picture of
conduction.

00:42:11.579 --> 00:42:15.492
You should in fact find it very
paradoxical that when you have

00:42:15.492 --> 00:42:18.251
an electric field,
the electric field produces a

00:42:18.251 --> 00:42:21.824
force e times E,
has an acceleration a,

00:42:21.824 --> 00:42:24.940
so the charges should
accelerate.

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:28.163
If they accelerate more and
more, the current should keep on

00:42:28.163 --> 00:42:30.239
growing because velocity is
growing.

00:42:30.239 --> 00:42:34.134
But you get a steady current,
in spite of a force acting to

00:42:34.134 --> 00:42:34.940
the right.
 

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:38.900
Do you know why that happens?
 

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:43.797
Why doesn't everything
accelerate and pick up more and

00:42:43.797 --> 00:42:45.829
more and more speed?
 

00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:47.480
Student:  Resistance.
 

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.719
Prof: It is resistance,
but microscopically,

00:42:50.719 --> 00:42:53.960
why don't these particles pick
up speed forever?

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.159
They collide.
 

00:42:56.159 --> 00:43:00.940
They collide with basically the
impurities in the solid.

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:03.500
And every time they hit their
head on one of the impurities,

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.512
they don't know what happened,
and they bounce off the

00:43:06.512 --> 00:43:08.900
collision in a totally random
direction.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:12.119
So they may go in this
direction, hit an impurity.

00:43:12.119 --> 00:43:14.260
There's no telling which way
they'll come out.

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:16.717
They can come out in any
direction with equal

00:43:16.717 --> 00:43:17.500
probability.
 

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:22.449
So they'll lose all memory of
what they were doing after each

00:43:22.449 --> 00:43:23.440
collision.
 

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:28.400
Now if I look at my clock,
and I look at the entire set of

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.840
electrons and I say,
what's the average velocity?

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:36.175
The average velocity,
which I denote with a bar,

00:43:36.175 --> 00:43:39.510
is obtained by averaging
individual velocity.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:44.260
Individual velocity is the
velocity at time 0 since the

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:48.130
last collision,
plus eE/m times

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:50.329
t_i.
 

00:43:50.329 --> 00:43:52.427
In other words,
let me explain to you slowly

00:43:52.427 --> 00:43:53.110
what I mean.
 

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:56.539
Take particle number i.
 

00:43:56.539 --> 00:43:59.735
Let us say it has been
t_i seconds

00:43:59.735 --> 00:44:01.909
since it had its last collision.
 

00:44:01.909 --> 00:44:04.867
So just after the collision,
it has got initial velocity

00:44:04.867 --> 00:44:07.686
which is completely random,
but since that thing,

00:44:07.686 --> 00:44:10.789
because the electric field it
has been accelerating,

00:44:10.789 --> 00:44:12.349
it has not collided with
anything yet,

00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:15.269
so its velocity will be
eE/m times

00:44:15.269 --> 00:44:16.949
t_i.
 

00:44:16.949 --> 00:44:20.494
Therefore the average velocity,
which you find by the averaging

00:44:20.494 --> 00:44:22.896
of everything,
has the following property -

00:44:22.896 --> 00:44:24.840
the first one will give you 0.
 

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:27.393
If you average over all
possible initial velocities,

00:44:27.393 --> 00:44:29.398
they'll be 0,
because they're pointing in

00:44:29.398 --> 00:44:30.500
random directions.
 

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:34.460
So what you really need is
eE/m times some

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:38.585
τ,
where τ is the name for the

00:44:38.585 --> 00:44:42.960
average time since the last
collision.

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.659
That time will have a range of
values.

00:44:44.659 --> 00:44:46.639
Some guys will have just
collided;

00:44:46.639 --> 00:44:49.159
some won't have collided for a
long time.

00:44:49.159 --> 00:44:51.672
So you have to find that
average, and we don't know how

00:44:51.672 --> 00:44:53.907
to compute it right now,
but that is some average

00:44:53.907 --> 00:44:55.768
t_i for a
material.

00:44:55.768 --> 00:44:57.608
The larger the
t_i is,

00:44:57.608 --> 00:45:00.460
the better the conductor it is,
because it can go for a long

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:02.300
time on average without
colliding.

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:04.813
So the whole idea is,
the minute you collide,

00:45:04.813 --> 00:45:07.327
you lose everything,
because you scatter off,

00:45:07.327 --> 00:45:08.869
forgetting your memory.
 

00:45:08.869 --> 00:45:12.414
So any coherent motion you have
in the direction of the field is

00:45:12.414 --> 00:45:15.059
there only because you have not
yet collided.

00:45:15.059 --> 00:45:18.085
So the net current is a
function of how many seconds

00:45:18.085 --> 00:45:21.230
have elapsed since the last
collision for each guy.

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:23.440
On average, it gives you this.
 

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:28.501
So if you use the symbol tau
for that, therefore the current

00:45:28.501 --> 00:45:33.219
density will be ne times
the average v.

00:45:33.219 --> 00:45:41.909
The average v is
eE/mτ.

00:45:41.909 --> 00:45:47.681
So if you write it as
ne^(2)τ/m

00:45:47.681 --> 00:45:50.929
times the electric field.
 

00:45:50.929 --> 00:45:52.780
So this is the very,
very important result.

00:45:52.780 --> 00:46:03.139
So I'm going to go back and
study this result.

00:46:03.139 --> 00:46:06.943
It tells you that the current
density in a wire is there

00:46:06.943 --> 00:46:10.885
thanks to the electric field and
the number in front of it

00:46:10.885 --> 00:46:13.306
happens to be the number of
carriers

00:46:13.306 --> 00:46:15.590
e^(2)τ/m.
 

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:17.239
Does that formula make sense?
 

00:46:17.239 --> 00:46:19.829
Take a minute to look at that
formula.

00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:21.460
You apply a field.
 

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:23.639
That's why they even know which
way to flow.

00:46:23.639 --> 00:46:25.416
If you don't have a field in a
wire, the current doesn't know

00:46:25.416 --> 00:46:26.010
which way to flow.
 

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:28.760
It's just random motion,
not going anywhere,

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:30.679
like molecules in this room.
 

00:46:30.679 --> 00:46:33.706
They're not going anywhere in
particular, even though they're

00:46:33.706 --> 00:46:34.159
moving.
 

00:46:34.159 --> 00:46:37.085
You are saying that the current
that you're going to get for

00:46:37.085 --> 00:46:40.210
unit area is bigger if you have
a bigger density of carriers.

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:42.773
That makes sense,
because they're the ones

00:46:42.773 --> 00:46:44.150
carrying the charge.
 

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:47.130
This is inversely proportional
to the mass.

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:48.380
You can understand why.
 

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:50.902
The electric field,
whatever force it produces,

00:46:50.902 --> 00:46:54.030
the acceleration is inversely
proportional to the mass.

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:56.730
The bigger the τ,
the bigger the response,

00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:59.744
because they can go for a
longer time on average before

00:46:59.744 --> 00:47:01.806
colliding,
therefore they have more time

00:47:01.806 --> 00:47:04.019
to pick up speed in the
direction of the field.

00:47:04.019 --> 00:47:06.780
e^(2) is interesting.
 

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.873
One e comes because the
force on the carrier is little

00:47:09.873 --> 00:47:11.420
e times big E.
 

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:14.461
The second e comes
because the current it carries

00:47:14.461 --> 00:47:16.510
is itself proportional to
e.

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:17.280
You understand?
 

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.050
The charge of the carrier
affects it in two ways.

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:22.559
Any time it moves,
it carries a charge e.

00:47:22.559 --> 00:47:24.981
How much it moves depends on
the force the electric field

00:47:24.981 --> 00:47:25.630
exerts on it.
 

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:26.969
That's another e.
 

00:47:26.969 --> 00:47:29.369
So this is our expression.
 

00:47:29.369 --> 00:47:34.204
And we write it as σ
times E,

00:47:34.204 --> 00:47:39.039
where sigma is called the
conductivity.

00:47:39.039 --> 00:47:42.307
You notice that this argument
doesn't care what material it

00:47:42.307 --> 00:47:42.590
is.
 

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:44.583
It could be copper,
it could be aluminum,

00:47:44.583 --> 00:47:45.829
it could be some alloy.
 

00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:47.978
For all of them,
the answer depends on

00:47:47.978 --> 00:47:49.719
ne^(2)τ/m.
 

00:47:49.719 --> 00:47:53.675
What depends on the actual
carrier, the mass is just the

00:47:53.675 --> 00:47:55.329
mass of the electron.
 

00:47:55.329 --> 00:47:58.179
τ is what varies from
problem to problem.

00:47:58.179 --> 00:48:00.717
Some materials have very large
τ, some materials are very

00:48:00.717 --> 00:48:01.309
small τ.
 

00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:06.059
That's what decides how good or
bad a conductor it is

00:48:06.059 --> 00:48:07.889
So this is the formula.
 

00:48:07.889 --> 00:48:11.519
Now sometimes you can write it
in another way.

00:48:11.519 --> 00:48:12.179
Let's see now.
 

00:48:12.179 --> 00:48:17.059
Suppose you have a wire.
 

00:48:17.059 --> 00:48:19.159
What is the total current in
the wire?

00:48:19.159 --> 00:48:24.001
The total current in the wire
is the current density times

00:48:24.001 --> 00:48:26.889
area, which is σAE.
 

00:48:26.889 --> 00:48:31.144
Now let us say this E
was obtained by applying the

00:48:31.144 --> 00:48:35.552
voltage difference V
between the two end points of a

00:48:35.552 --> 00:48:37.679
wire of length L.
 

00:48:37.679 --> 00:48:48.590
There is
σAV/L.

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:49.230
Do you understand?
 

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:51.643
The electric field times the
length of the wire is the

00:48:51.643 --> 00:48:53.829
voltage difference between the
two end points.

00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:56.184
So rather than saying the
current is driven by the

00:48:56.184 --> 00:48:58.561
electric field,
let's say the current is driven

00:48:58.561 --> 00:49:01.099
by the voltage difference
between the two ends of the

00:49:01.099 --> 00:49:01.489
wire.
 

00:49:01.489 --> 00:49:05.550
That's why I wrote E as
V/L.

00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:10.184
But now you see it looks like
V/R that R

00:49:10.184 --> 00:49:14.590
is by definition is called the
resistance of that wire.

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:21.039
It's measured in ohms,
as denoted by this symbol.

00:49:21.039 --> 00:49:24.463
This is how you get ohm's law,
because just by going through

00:49:24.463 --> 00:49:28.353
the microscopic equation,
and applying it for a wire of

00:49:28.353 --> 00:49:31.278
length L,
I'm able to find that the

00:49:31.278 --> 00:49:33.590
current is proportional to
V,

00:49:33.590 --> 00:49:35.349
divided by some number.
 

00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:41.760
That number looks like
L/Aσ,

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:44.440
also written as
Lρ/A,

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:49.460
where ρ = 1/σ
is called the resistivity.

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:55.650
It's just the inverse of the
conductivity.

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:59.039
So the bigger the resistivity,
the bigger the resistance,

00:49:59.039 --> 00:50:01.460
but notice, if the wire is
twice as long,

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:04.610
the resistance of the wire will
be twice as big.

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:06.809
Does that make sense to you?
 

00:50:06.809 --> 00:50:09.268
For a given material,
if you double the length of the

00:50:09.268 --> 00:50:10.639
wire, resistance is double.
 

00:50:10.639 --> 00:50:13.795
If you double the area,
resistance is turned into half

00:50:13.795 --> 00:50:16.333
its value,
because if you've got a big

00:50:16.333 --> 00:50:20.188
wire, you can think of it as two
wires that are carrying the

00:50:20.188 --> 00:50:23.396
current together,
therefore the resistance is

00:50:23.396 --> 00:50:24.349
half as much.
 

00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:29.320
So this is the relation between
resistivity and the resistance.

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:32.248
As far as we are concerned,
the main thing for us is just

00:50:32.248 --> 00:50:36.753
ohm's law,
which we are going to use -

00:50:36.753 --> 00:50:41.259
V = IR,
and this is telling you roughly

00:50:41.259 --> 00:50:42.559
where you get it.
 

00:50:42.559 --> 00:50:45.280
So what's the summary of all
this talk?

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:50.070
In a wire, unlike in a perfect
conductor, there is an electric

00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:50.699
field.
 

00:50:50.699 --> 00:50:55.219
And it's the electric field
that keeps the charges moving.

00:50:55.219 --> 00:50:57.503
But whereas an electron,
for example,

00:50:57.503 --> 00:51:00.550
in the vacuum electric field
that will accelerate

00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:01.630
indefinitely.
 

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:04.532
The carriers in the wire do not
accelerate indefinitely because

00:51:04.532 --> 00:51:06.969
they keep bumping into stuff,
and every time they bump into

00:51:06.969 --> 00:51:08.989
stuff,
they lose the gain they had.

00:51:08.989 --> 00:51:10.440
They start all over again.
 

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:13.197
So at any given time,
the activity I have or the

00:51:13.197 --> 00:51:16.719
motion I have depends on how
many guys are still around since

00:51:16.719 --> 00:51:18.070
the last collision.
 

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:21.123
They're the ones who have been
picking up speed,

00:51:21.123 --> 00:51:24.630
and that's how you get
conductivity proportional to the

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:25.800
applied field.
 

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:28.449
So it's hard to get a velocity
proportional to force.

00:51:28.449 --> 00:51:31.382
You always get acceleration
proportional to force,

00:51:31.382 --> 00:51:34.315
but when you've got random
motion, the velocity is

00:51:34.315 --> 00:51:36.590
proportional to the applied
field.

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:39.719
By the way, I should tell you,
in a real solid,

00:51:39.719 --> 00:51:43.530
if you ask what do they collide
into, can you imagine?

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:48.601
You have a mental picture of a
solid where the atoms form a

00:51:48.601 --> 00:51:49.739
nice array.
 

00:51:49.739 --> 00:51:51.880
The nuclei form a nice periodic
array.

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:56.849
The electrons in a metal are
free to travel the length and

00:51:56.849 --> 00:51:58.679
width of the solid.
 

00:51:58.679 --> 00:52:02.331
But who do you think I'm
talking about when I say

00:52:02.331 --> 00:52:03.320
collisions?
 

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.789
Pardon me?
 

00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:05.639
Student:  Other
electrons.

00:52:05.639 --> 00:52:07.260
Prof: Other electrons is
possible.

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:10.380
How about with the nuclei?
 

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:12.239
If you're an electron,
you're going through,

00:52:12.239 --> 00:52:15.096
you see a nuclei every
whatever, 10 to the -8

00:52:15.096 --> 00:52:18.125
centimeters,
there's another nucleus,

00:52:18.125 --> 00:52:20.610
but that's not what matters.
 

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:23.213
This is more advanced theory,
when you try to find the

00:52:23.213 --> 00:52:24.590
conductivity of materials.
 

00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:29.351
A perfectly periodic lattice of
nuclei, electrons have a way to

00:52:29.351 --> 00:52:32.809
travel through them without ever
colliding.

00:52:32.809 --> 00:52:36.166
It's like, if you cannot see
and the furniture is all in a

00:52:36.166 --> 00:52:38.759
certain place,
you can navigate freely around

00:52:38.759 --> 00:52:39.289
them.
 

00:52:39.289 --> 00:52:42.320
But if somebody moves something
and you're not expecting it,

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.119
that's when you have a
collision.

00:52:44.119 --> 00:52:46.768
And that motion comes about
when you heat the solid.

00:52:46.768 --> 00:52:49.391
When you heat the solid,
the nuclei start vibrating,

00:52:49.391 --> 00:52:51.909
so you don't know quite where
somebody will be.

00:52:51.909 --> 00:52:54.811
That gives a small probability
for the electron to collide with

00:52:54.811 --> 00:52:55.139
them.
 

00:52:55.139 --> 00:52:57.943
Therefore the conductivity will
quite often depend on the

00:52:57.943 --> 00:53:00.447
temperature, but it can also
depend on the force of

00:53:00.447 --> 00:53:02.199
interactions between electrons.
 

00:53:02.199 --> 00:53:05.864
But even if electrons don't
interact with each other in a

00:53:05.864 --> 00:53:09.724
serious way, the collision with
the nucleus is controlled by

00:53:09.724 --> 00:53:11.230
lattice vibrations.
 

00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:13.568
But no matter how sophisticated
the calculation is,

00:53:13.568 --> 00:53:16.233
you can go to my office and
ask, what are people doing for

00:53:16.233 --> 00:53:17.030
conductivity?
 

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:20.483
Everyone is trying to compute
this quantity τ

00:53:20.483 --> 00:53:22.929
and
ne^(2)τ/m.

00:53:22.929 --> 00:53:24.534
The n,
the e^(2),

00:53:24.534 --> 00:53:26.619
they're all what you think they
mean.

00:53:26.619 --> 00:53:29.244
τ is more sophisticated,
and you have to calculate it in

00:53:29.244 --> 00:53:30.090
a quantum theory.
 

00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:31.650
But in the end,
after all the work,

00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:34.400
you get a number τ,
you put it in the same formula,

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:40.115
ne^(2)τ/m to
get the conductivity of a

00:53:40.115 --> 00:53:41.260
material.
 

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:44.969
So now I want to do a little
electric circuits for you.

00:53:44.969 --> 00:53:48.079
So here's one simple circuit
I'm going to do.

00:53:48.079 --> 00:53:55.786
I'm going to take a capacitor,
charge it up to some amount

00:53:55.786 --> 00:54:00.938
Q,
then I'm going to put my

00:54:00.938 --> 00:54:09.909
resistor here like this and ask
what happens when I close that

00:54:09.909 --> 00:54:11.380
switch.
 

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:14.300
So when I close the switch,
we can all imagine what will

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:14.780
happen.
 

00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:17.454
These positive guys are dying
to get over to the negative

00:54:17.454 --> 00:54:20.559
side, but they cannot jump the
gap here, because it's a vacuum.

00:54:20.559 --> 00:54:23.639
But if you give them a path,
they will go through that and

00:54:23.639 --> 00:54:25.260
come back to the other side.
 

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:28.771
So charges will start going
round if only I close the

00:54:28.771 --> 00:54:29.380
switch.
 

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:32.349
So when I close the switch,
let me write down an equation

00:54:32.349 --> 00:54:33.570
for what will happen.
 

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:35.909
There's a resistance here.
 

00:54:35.909 --> 00:54:39.250
This is the current I flowing
here.

00:54:39.250 --> 00:54:43.045
The fundamental equation you
write down in any circuit is if

00:54:43.045 --> 00:54:46.315
you start at any point,
you take any closed path and

00:54:46.315 --> 00:54:48.369
find all the changes in
potential,

00:54:48.369 --> 00:54:51.179
the change has to be 0.
 

00:54:51.179 --> 00:54:53.221
Because it's coming from a
conservative field,

00:54:53.221 --> 00:54:55.579
the integral of the electric
field on a loop is 0.

00:54:55.579 --> 00:54:59.711
That means the total change in
potential from anywhere back to

00:54:59.711 --> 00:55:03.099
the same place is 0,
because it's like a height.

00:55:03.099 --> 00:55:06.809
So when I start here and I go
through the capacitor,

00:55:06.809 --> 00:55:11.570
I go up in electrical height by
an amount Q/C.

00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:16.010
This conductor is assumed to be
a perfect conductor,

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:18.690
so there is no electric field
inside here,

00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:23.150
there's no change in potential
until I come to this resistor.

00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:25.632
A resistor will not carry
current unless there's a voltage

00:55:25.632 --> 00:55:26.329
applied to it.
 

00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:28.867
You've seen there,
and this is the higher end of

00:55:28.867 --> 00:55:31.514
the voltage, this is the lower
end of the voltage,

00:55:31.514 --> 00:55:33.349
because it's flowing downhill.
 

00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:36.583
So you have a drop in voltage
by an amount RI,

00:55:36.583 --> 00:55:39.260
then you come back to the
starting point.

00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:43.579
All the changes you had better
add up to 0.

00:55:43.579 --> 00:55:45.565
That's the fundamental
statement that in any electrical

00:55:45.565 --> 00:55:47.063
circuit,
if you start anywhere and go

00:55:47.063 --> 00:55:49.329
through any path in the circuit
and come back to a starting

00:55:49.329 --> 00:55:51.192
point,
the net change in voltage has

00:55:51.192 --> 00:55:53.242
to be 0,
because every point has an

00:55:53.242 --> 00:55:54.369
electrical height.
 

00:55:54.369 --> 00:55:56.380
So this is our equation.
 

00:55:56.380 --> 00:56:02.920
Now we can write it as RI =
Q/C.

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:10.349
But what's the relation between
I and Q?

00:56:10.349 --> 00:56:14.480
Can you find a relation between
I and Q?

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:19.429
Suppose a current flows for a
short time.

00:56:19.429 --> 00:56:22.110
Who's paying for it?
 

00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:26.099
Where is the charge coming from?
 

00:56:26.099 --> 00:56:27.230
Yes?
 

00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:34.449
Student:  Isn't I
Q divided by time?

00:56:34.449 --> 00:56:37.858
Prof: It's not
necessarily divided by time,

00:56:37.858 --> 00:56:39.530
but it's a derivative.
 

00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:43.717
I is dQ /dt,
because in a small time

00:56:43.717 --> 00:56:45.998
dt,
when the current I

00:56:45.998 --> 00:56:48.840
flows, Idt coulombs
flow through here,

00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.739
but they've got to come from
there.

00:56:50.739 --> 00:56:54.730
But the only thing missing is
the - sign.

00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:57.529
Because if I is defined this
way and is positive,

00:56:57.529 --> 00:57:00.269
a positive I depletes the
charge, so I is

00:57:00.269 --> 00:57:01.670
−dQ/dt.
 

00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:08.887
So I have the equation here
that looks like--so go back to

00:57:08.887 --> 00:57:16.739
RI = Q/C and write
it as RdQ/dt.

00:57:16.739 --> 00:57:23.880
This is my equation.
 

00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:32.731
That can be written as
dQ/Q =

00:57:32.731 --> 00:57:37.579
-dt/RC.
 

00:57:37.579 --> 00:57:41.255
Now if you integrate that from
start to finish and start to

00:57:41.255 --> 00:57:43.802
finish,
this will give you log of

00:57:43.802 --> 00:57:48.394
Q over the initial Q
will be - the time divided

00:57:48.394 --> 00:57:49.619
by RC.
 

00:57:49.619 --> 00:57:58.126
Or Q of time t
will be Q_0e^(-t)

00:57:58.126 --> 00:58:01.059
^(/RC).
 

00:58:01.059 --> 00:58:04.018
That means after you close the
switch,

00:58:04.018 --> 00:58:07.128
if you measure the charge and
the capacitor as a function of

00:58:07.128 --> 00:58:09.494
time,
it starts with some

00:58:09.494 --> 00:58:14.610
Q_0 and it
decays exponentially.

00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:17.449
How long does it take for it to
completely discharge?

00:58:17.449 --> 00:58:22.039
The answer is infinite amount
of time.

00:58:22.039 --> 00:58:26.190
Why is the capacitor not able
to discharge it completely?

00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:28.449
Can you think about that?
 

00:58:28.449 --> 00:58:31.268
Why doesn't it just get it over
with, right?

00:58:31.268 --> 00:58:33.820
Just dump all the charge to the
other plate?

00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:34.750
Why is it taking forever?
 

00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:37.579
Student:  There's always
resistance.

00:58:37.579 --> 00:58:39.039
Prof: There is always
resistance.

00:58:39.039 --> 00:58:42.108
There has always been
resistance, so what's happening

00:58:42.108 --> 00:58:43.170
as time goes by?
 

00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:50.090
Student: 
&gt;

00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:53.500
Prof: The voltage on the
capacitor plate is decreasing

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:54.579
with time, right?
 

00:58:54.579 --> 00:58:57.719
That's the voltage driving the
current through the resistor.

00:58:57.719 --> 00:59:01.188
So as it drives current through
the resistor and it begins to

00:59:01.188 --> 00:59:03.733
become empty,
it's able to drive less current

00:59:03.733 --> 00:59:05.179
through the resistor.
 

00:59:05.179 --> 00:59:08.009
So it's trying to work against
itself, but it doesn't have

00:59:08.009 --> 00:59:10.590
enough Q on it to drive
more Q down.

00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:11.300
That's why.
 

00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:13.809
That's the meaning of the
equation.

00:59:13.809 --> 00:59:17.150
The rate of flow of Q is
proportional to Q itself.

00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:18.699
So as long as there is some
Q left,

00:59:18.699 --> 00:59:21.170
it will be decaying,
but it will never come to 0,

00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:24.860
because the driving force for
the decay is Q itself.

00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:26.909
And if you say how long should
I wait?

00:59:26.909 --> 00:59:31.757
There's a certain time called
1/RC, which is called the

00:59:31.757 --> 00:59:33.030
time constant.
 

00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:38.300
But any exponential function,
e^(-t)/t_0,

00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:40.280
if t is much bigger than
t_0,

00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:42.998
then you've got e to the
minus huge number and that's a

00:59:42.998 --> 00:59:43.889
negligible number.
 

00:59:43.889 --> 00:59:46.338
So whenever you say something's
falling exponentially,

00:59:46.338 --> 00:59:48.188
it doesn't mean that it may
take forever,

00:59:48.188 --> 00:59:49.760
or It may happen very quickly.
 

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:52.039
It depends what's up in the
exponent.

00:59:52.039 --> 00:59:55.186
All exponential functions will
look like e to the minus

00:59:55.186 --> 00:59:57.920
time over some other number with
dimension of time.

00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.079
That's the unit in which you
measure time.

01:00:00.079 --> 01:00:02.947
If little t is many
times big t_0,

01:00:02.947 --> 01:00:06.268
then it's e to the minus
big number, which is negligible.

01:00:06.268 --> 01:00:10.485
So you've got to wait many time
constants before a capacitor

01:00:10.485 --> 01:00:11.699
will discharge.
 

01:00:11.699 --> 01:00:14.300
So capacitors are pretty
dangerous.

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.990
In fact, your computer,
if you open it,

01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:20.389
there can be capacitors inside
which are charged,

01:00:20.389 --> 01:00:23.789
even though it's not plugged
into the mains.

01:00:23.789 --> 01:00:26.344
So don't think it's safe to
open an electrical device,

01:00:26.344 --> 01:00:28.610
just because it's not plugged
into the mains.

01:00:28.610 --> 01:00:30.766
Because people tell you,
"Hey, pull the plug,

01:00:30.766 --> 01:00:32.440
then you can do what you
want."

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.581
Not quite, because if you do
that, that's a big fat

01:00:35.581 --> 01:00:38.219
capacitor, that R stands
for you.

01:00:38.219 --> 01:00:42.159
That current is going to go
right through you.

01:00:42.159 --> 01:00:44.679
That's why they always tell
you, "Do not take this

01:00:44.679 --> 01:00:46.780
computer to your bathtub"
for example.

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:48.976
So these warnings,
even though they sound

01:00:48.976 --> 01:00:50.789
ridiculous, part of it is true.
 

01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:52.179
Capacitors are very dangerous.
 

01:00:52.179 --> 01:00:55.239
What you want to do is
discharge all your capacitors

01:00:55.239 --> 01:00:55.719
first.
 

01:00:55.719 --> 01:00:58.639
Even in flash bulbs,
that's what happens.

01:00:58.639 --> 01:01:00.813
You charge up a lot of charge
in a capacitor,

01:01:00.813 --> 01:01:03.876
and the resistance there is the
bulb itself, the little coil in

01:01:03.876 --> 01:01:04.518
the bulb.
 

01:01:04.518 --> 01:01:07.400
When we close the circuit,
the capacitor dumps all its

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.518
charge and then in the brief
moment,

01:01:09.518 --> 01:01:12.929
the coil heats up,
namely R heats up and

01:01:12.929 --> 01:01:15.079
glows and you have a flash.
 

01:01:15.079 --> 01:01:17.489
But there you want time
constant to be very small,

01:01:17.489 --> 01:01:20.639
because how long are you going
to tell people to keep smiling?

01:01:20.639 --> 01:01:24.217
So you've got to get on with
it, so you put in a very quick,

01:01:24.217 --> 01:01:27.612
very rapid time constant,
so R is going to be very

01:01:27.612 --> 01:01:28.219
small.
 

01:01:28.219 --> 01:01:31.110
Sometimes you want the decay to
be very, very slow.

01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:34.320
People are even thinking of
getting rid of batteries and

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.780
just buying capacitors.
 

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.336
With a capacitor,
you can use it to drive

01:01:38.336 --> 01:01:41.469
something, but slowly the
voltage will go down.

01:01:41.469 --> 01:01:44.211
So if your device can operate
over a range of voltage,

01:01:44.211 --> 01:01:46.800
the voltage is just
Q(t)/C.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.610
That's the voltage at a given
time.

01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:52.130
If it can operate up to that
voltage, between that and that

01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:54.559
voltage, you can run it for that
time.

01:01:54.559 --> 01:02:01.619
Okay, so this is the fate of
the current.

01:02:01.619 --> 01:02:04.130
Now what is
Q_0?

01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:07.795
At t = 0,
what is the charge in the

01:02:07.795 --> 01:02:08.869
capacitor?
 

01:02:08.869 --> 01:02:11.989
Well, that's the initial charge
in the capacitor.

01:02:11.989 --> 01:02:14.940
What is the current in this
problem, I?

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:16.150
It's just dQ/dt.
 

01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:20.876
It's −dQ/dt,
and if you do

01:02:20.876 --> 01:02:25.726
−dQ/dt,
you'll find there's

01:02:25.726 --> 01:02:29.210
Q_0/RC.
 

01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:32.824
Just take the derivative of
this function times

01:02:32.824 --> 01:02:34.789
e^(−t/RC).
 

01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:37.157
At t = 0,
Q_0/C is the

01:02:37.157 --> 01:02:39.737
voltage in the capacitor,
divided by R as a

01:02:39.737 --> 01:02:40.369
current.
 

01:02:40.369 --> 01:02:46.532
That's a current it starts
with, but the current also

01:02:46.532 --> 01:02:52.460
decays exponentially,
so with another prefactor.

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:55.896
But there's one calculation I
wanted to do,

01:02:55.896 --> 01:02:58.679
which is the energy
calculation.

01:02:58.679 --> 01:03:05.016
If I had a capacitor that was
charged, I had an energy

01:03:05.016 --> 01:03:09.440
½CV^(2),
or if you want,

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:12.670
Q^(2)/2C.
 

01:03:12.670 --> 01:03:15.286
At the end of the day,
my capacitor's completely

01:03:15.286 --> 01:03:16.010
discharged.
 

01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:19.164
You want to ask yourself,
what happened to the energy I

01:03:19.164 --> 01:03:20.510
had in the capacitor?
 

01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:23.378
And we all know the answer is
that it went through the

01:03:23.378 --> 01:03:26.300
resistor and heated it up,
and the heat energy or light

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:28.518
energy is where you got your
rewards.

01:03:28.518 --> 01:03:32.500
But we've got to make sure that
the energy deposited in the

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:36.548
resistor over all time is equal
to the energy you had in the

01:03:36.548 --> 01:03:37.510
capacitor.
 

01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:41.789
That's the last one thing I
wanted you to check.

01:03:41.789 --> 01:03:46.244
So when current goes through a
resistor--here's a current going

01:03:46.244 --> 01:03:50.554
through a resistor--what is the
rate at which energy is being

01:03:50.554 --> 01:03:51.489
consumed?
 

01:03:51.489 --> 01:03:53.414
So you must think,
let me draw the resistor this

01:03:53.414 --> 01:03:53.659
way.
 

01:03:53.659 --> 01:03:55.170
Its' very suggestive.
 

01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:58.434
You're flowing downhill
electrically through voltage

01:03:58.434 --> 01:03:59.139
V.
 

01:03:59.139 --> 01:04:04.190
Every coulomb that falls down
loses an energy Q times

01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:06.159
V as it falls.
 

01:04:06.159 --> 01:04:09.469
And that's the energy that's
given to the wire by colliding

01:04:09.469 --> 01:04:11.809
with the stuff in it and heating
it up.

01:04:11.809 --> 01:04:15.092
Therefore in 1 second,
the number of coulombs falling

01:04:15.092 --> 01:04:17.679
down is VI and that's the
power.

01:04:17.679 --> 01:04:22.800
So power in the resistor is
VI.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:26.000
That's the rate of energy
consumption.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:33.632
So in this problem,
V is Q/C and I,

01:04:33.632 --> 01:04:43.175
I got somewhere here--I'm too
close to the board to see where

01:04:43.175 --> 01:04:45.719
anything is.
 

01:04:45.719 --> 01:04:47.170
I want to first find the
current.

01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:48.550
Here is my current.
 

01:04:48.550 --> 01:04:50.400
I'm sorry, there's an easier
way to do this.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:53.822
Instead of writing VI,
let me write it as

01:04:53.822 --> 01:04:56.809
I^(2)R,
because 1V is IR.

01:04:56.809 --> 01:05:01.349
So I want to integrate from 0
to infinity the quantity

01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:02.719
I^(2)R.
 

01:05:02.719 --> 01:05:05.409
Now I'm not going to waste your
time, guys.

01:05:05.409 --> 01:05:06.588
First of all,
you know how to do this

01:05:06.588 --> 01:05:06.949
integral.
 

01:05:06.949 --> 01:05:09.298
Square this,
multiply by R and do the

01:05:09.298 --> 01:05:11.594
integral, and believe me,
you will just get

01:05:11.594 --> 01:05:13.780
Q_0
^(2)/2C.

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:17.519
I don't want to spend time
doing that.

01:05:17.519 --> 01:05:18.750
So that's where the energy goes.
 

01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:30.980
 
 

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:32.510
You follow that?
 

01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:35.813
The capacitor discharges
through the resistor and the

01:05:35.813 --> 01:05:39.306
energy you pumped into it comes
out in the form of heat,

01:05:39.306 --> 01:05:41.150
or light if it's glowing.
 

01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:44.070
And we have seen the balance of
energy.

01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:48.103
But now the trouble with this
circuit is that it doesn't last

01:05:48.103 --> 01:05:48.909
very long.
 

01:05:48.909 --> 01:05:50.550
You've done it once,
you're finished.

01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:52.159
The capacitor discharges.
 

01:05:52.159 --> 01:05:57.634
If you want an experiment where
the current can keep on running,

01:05:57.634 --> 01:06:01.980
then you need what's called a
cell or a battery.

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:04.030
I've got to explain to you a
little bit about the cell.

01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:07.976
It's something I did not fully
understand the first time

01:06:07.976 --> 01:06:12.208
around, so I want to share with
you whatever understanding I

01:06:12.208 --> 01:06:14.289
have, how the cell works.
 

01:06:14.289 --> 01:06:17.963
People generally tell you a
cell provides a certain voltage

01:06:17.963 --> 01:06:21.572
difference between the end
points, maybe 1.2 volts between

01:06:21.572 --> 01:06:23.219
this and the terminal.
 

01:06:23.219 --> 01:06:27.016
That's certainly true,
but in light of what we have

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:31.650
learned, here is what is the
correct way to think about it.

01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:33.880
The analogy is with the ski
resort.

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.739
So here is the ski resort.
 

01:06:36.739 --> 01:06:39.170
All these guys are coming down.
 

01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:41.809
Let's follow one person coming
down the ski.

01:06:41.809 --> 01:06:45.331
Gravity's acting down here,
then you sort of loop around

01:06:45.331 --> 01:06:47.190
and you come here for free.
 

01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:52.389
Then there is a lift that takes
you to the top.

01:06:52.389 --> 01:06:58.949
So let's call it the force of
the lift.

01:06:58.949 --> 01:07:01.141
The force of the lift has
nothing to do with gravity,

01:07:01.141 --> 01:07:02.869
driven by some other engines
and so on.

01:07:02.869 --> 01:07:10.217
And we define force of the lift
on the closed loop to be

01:07:10.217 --> 01:07:14.760
something called curly E.
 

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:20.492
This is the mechanical analog
of what's called electromotive

01:07:20.492 --> 01:07:21.268
force.
 

01:07:21.268 --> 01:07:26.300
Now this line integral of this
force is not 0 on a closed loop,

01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:29.460
because on the way up,
it is doing some work,

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:32.750
but it doesn't do anything the
rest of the circuit.

01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:35.789
It's always acting up,
moving a distance h.

01:07:35.789 --> 01:07:40.239
Maybe that force times h is the
electromotor force.

01:07:40.239 --> 01:07:43.367
So you go to the top,
you come down,

01:07:43.367 --> 01:07:48.637
and the electromotive force
comes and pushes you back to the

01:07:48.637 --> 01:07:52.570
top, and again,
gravity brings you down.

01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:54.465
So in a battery,
what you have is the following

01:07:54.465 --> 01:07:56.690
- that's where you have to
follow this very closely.

01:07:56.690 --> 01:08:01.579
Here is an electrical cell.
 

01:08:01.579 --> 01:08:06.603
In an electrical cell,
there are a lot of positive

01:08:06.603 --> 01:08:11.422
charges and there are a lot of
negative charges,

01:08:11.422 --> 01:08:15.730
and the field in fact looks
like this.

01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:17.979
So when a current flows,
it goes like that,

01:08:17.979 --> 01:08:19.908
goes through resistor,
comes down.

01:08:19.908 --> 01:08:22.994
But the current,
you realize,

01:08:22.994 --> 01:08:25.420
has to flow up here.
 

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:28.673
Inside the cell,
if the current flows this way,

01:08:28.673 --> 01:08:31.078
the current has to go like
this.

01:08:31.078 --> 01:08:34.671
The electric field is actually
pointing down between the

01:08:34.671 --> 01:08:35.260
plates.
 

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:39.350
That's not what makes it move,
because there's an extra force.

01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:41.180
This is your electric field.
 

01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:43.859
There's an extra force called
E',

01:08:43.859 --> 01:08:48.247
which is of chemical origin,
which pushes your charges

01:08:48.247 --> 01:08:53.380
against their will from lower
potential to higher potential.

01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:55.310
That is like the ski lift.
 

01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:58.630
Electric field everywhere is
like gravity.

01:08:58.630 --> 01:09:01.798
Its line integral that way and
line integral that way are all

01:09:01.798 --> 01:09:02.380
the same.
 

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:05.390
But this E' has a line
integral,

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:07.788
E'⋅dr
on a closed loop,

01:09:07.788 --> 01:09:12.729
which is not equal to 0 and in
fact is called the emf.

01:09:12.729 --> 01:09:16.289
You can see it's not 0,
because it's non-zero here.

01:09:16.289 --> 01:09:18.340
Everywhere else it is 0.
 

01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:20.648
And in the region where it's
non-zero, there's no

01:09:20.648 --> 01:09:21.368
cancellation.
 

01:09:21.368 --> 01:09:25.520
The displacement and the force
are all in the same direction.

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:28.979
So it's a non-conservative
force sitting inside a battery.

01:09:28.979 --> 01:09:30.710
It's a chemical force.
 

01:09:30.710 --> 01:09:34.662
The usual electric field that
we all like,

01:09:34.662 --> 01:09:40.641
E⋅dr,
in fact has line integral equal

01:09:40.641 --> 01:09:41.510
to 0.
 

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:45.479
But when you're inside this
battery,

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:48.557
if you ask how big is this
E' and how big is this

01:09:48.557 --> 01:09:51.235
E,
what happens inside the battery

01:09:51.235 --> 01:09:53.144
is,
once you start piling up

01:09:53.144 --> 01:09:55.783
charges there,
this electric field opposed to

01:09:55.783 --> 01:09:59.342
the charge is coming,
the chemical force will exactly

01:09:59.342 --> 01:10:02.140
balance the electrical force
inside.

01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:07.034
So inside this region,
the electric field will be -

01:10:07.034 --> 01:10:09.189
that chemical force.
 

01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:18.689
E' is the chemical force
per charge.

01:10:18.689 --> 01:10:22.011
Inside the battery,
there is something that takes

01:10:22.011 --> 01:10:26.301
the charge against its natural
instinct, against gravity if you

01:10:26.301 --> 01:10:28.100
like, and takes it up.
 

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:30.525
You need something like that to
make this thing run,

01:10:30.525 --> 01:10:32.810
otherwise charges will just sit
in the bottom.

01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:34.039
They won't go up.
 

01:10:34.039 --> 01:10:36.069
So you need an external agency.
 

01:10:36.069 --> 01:10:37.939
Sometimes you can have a belt.
 

01:10:37.939 --> 01:10:41.337
In a Van der Graaf generator,
you have a belt that runs up

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:44.380
and down and carries positive
charge to the top,

01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:48.118
even though the top is already
positively charged.

01:10:48.118 --> 01:10:49.775
Left to itself,
a positive charge would never

01:10:49.775 --> 01:10:51.810
like to go to the dome which is
positively charged,

01:10:51.810 --> 01:10:54.970
but you drag it on that belt,
kicking and screaming.

01:10:54.970 --> 01:10:57.630
You've got to do that to charge
it up against its will.

01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:59.658
That's what provides the force
there.

01:10:59.658 --> 01:11:02.988
You can connect that guy to the
resistor and the current will

01:11:02.988 --> 01:11:03.819
keep flowing.
 

01:11:03.819 --> 01:11:06.569
Now here is the interesting
thing.

01:11:06.569 --> 01:11:10.573
Since inside this loop,
the electric field and the

01:11:10.573 --> 01:11:13.680
chemical force are exactly
balanced.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:17.561
Now let's look at
E⋅dr

01:11:17.561 --> 01:11:21.362
between here and here,
between the positive and

01:11:21.362 --> 01:11:23.180
negative terminal.
 

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:26.623
That's the same as
E⋅dr

01:11:26.623 --> 01:11:27.270
inside.
 

01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:32.641
So
E⋅dr

01:11:32.641 --> 01:11:40.029
from the positive to the
negative terminal is

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:47.921
−E'
⋅dr from the

01:11:47.921 --> 01:11:57.323
positive to the negative
terminal is V_-

01:11:57.323 --> 01:12:02.529
- V_ .
 

01:12:02.529 --> 01:12:11.407
Therefore V_ 
- V_- is the

01:12:11.407 --> 01:12:12.310
emf.
 

01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:14.380
So if the chemical force has an
emf,

01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:16.347
which is the line integral of
the chemical force around a

01:12:16.347 --> 01:12:17.957
loop,
which is basically inside a

01:12:17.957 --> 01:12:20.189
battery,
that will be also equal to the

01:12:20.189 --> 01:12:23.670
voltage difference for a person
living outside the battery.

01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:26.117
If a person outside the battery
went on a loop like this from

01:12:26.117 --> 01:12:28.029
here to here,
the line integral done by the

01:12:28.029 --> 01:12:30.738
electric field,
which is the voltage dropped,

01:12:30.738 --> 01:12:33.253
if you want,
the voltage gain between this

01:12:33.253 --> 01:12:37.207
one and this one,
will be exactly equal to the

01:12:37.207 --> 01:12:37.729
emf.
 

01:12:37.729 --> 01:12:43.189
So V_  and
this is V_-.

01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:45.408
Let me just make sure this part
is correct.

01:12:45.408 --> 01:12:48.960
The line integral is 0,
or if you like,

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:52.448
the integral of the electric
field from here to here,

01:12:52.448 --> 01:12:53.988
doesn't matter which path you
take,

01:12:53.988 --> 01:12:55.810
but the electric field is
conservative.

01:12:55.810 --> 01:13:01.779
That's equal to the integral of
-E from here to here,

01:13:01.779 --> 01:13:05.234
but that's the same as being
the polarities reversed in the

01:13:05.234 --> 01:13:08.840
integral,
and that will be the emf.

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:16.559
So that = integral
E⋅dr

01:13:16.559 --> 01:13:18.649
from - to .
 

01:13:18.649 --> 01:13:22.259
And that will = V_
 -

01:13:22.259 --> 01:13:27.038
V_-,
if you write it that way.

01:13:27.038 --> 01:13:29.277
Okay, so the point is,
when you have a battery,

01:13:29.277 --> 01:13:31.612
if you don't want to get into
any of the details,

01:13:31.612 --> 01:13:33.510
this is what you guys have to
know.

01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:36.579
If you don't look under the
hood, just look at those two

01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:37.250
terminals.
 

01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:40.844
There'll be a voltage
difference between them equal to

01:13:40.844 --> 01:13:43.488
what's called the emf of the
battery.

01:13:43.488 --> 01:13:46.536
The subtle thing to remember
is, there are non conservative

01:13:46.536 --> 01:13:48.479
forces at work inside the
battery,

01:13:48.479 --> 01:13:51.184
this is what you may not
realize, whose line integral is

01:13:51.184 --> 01:13:53.536
in fact not 0,
but you don't have to know all

01:13:53.536 --> 01:13:53.840
that.
 

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:56.390
You just have to know the
integral, you have to know what

01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:59.170
happens if I go from here to
here in an electrical circuit.

01:13:59.170 --> 01:14:01.890
I go up in voltage equal to
V .

01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:03.529
That's what I want you to
remember.

01:14:03.529 --> 01:14:06.161
For those of you who want to
know the details,

01:14:06.161 --> 01:14:08.149
this is the reason that
happens.

01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:10.417
From now on,
we won't look inside the

01:14:10.417 --> 01:14:11.109
terminal.
 

01:14:11.109 --> 01:14:14.127
We'll take every battery to
have an emf E,

01:14:14.127 --> 01:14:17.082
meaning if you jump from a
negative to positive,

01:14:17.082 --> 01:14:18.529
you gain a voltage.
 

01:14:18.529 --> 01:14:24.000

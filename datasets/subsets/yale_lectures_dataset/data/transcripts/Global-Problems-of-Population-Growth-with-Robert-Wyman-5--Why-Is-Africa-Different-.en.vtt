00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.510
Prof: I see this is
largely,

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.600
but of course not exclusively a
female class,

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.589
and I know that's because of
the reputation of the class as

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:11.930
being very tough on men.
 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.250
What have we learned about men
so far?

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.438
They're violent,
they contribute only a speck of

00:00:18.438 --> 00:00:22.034
protoplasm to the next
generation, they help hardly at

00:00:22.034 --> 00:00:23.730
all in child rearing.
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.239
In the Tuesday reading you
found that they're even afraid

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.942
of their wives,
and on Thursday how many of you

00:00:31.942 --> 00:00:34.600
did the reading about the Na?
 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.150
What do they believe about
man's role in reproduction?

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.960
Student:  Gardening.
 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.550
Prof: Just do gardening,
they just water it.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.446
That the baby comes totally
from the woman's substance and

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:50.250
men just have to water it
occasionally.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.326
As you know water is water,
is water so it doesn't matter

00:00:54.326 --> 00:00:57.237
which man waters it,
and they have a very

00:00:57.237 --> 00:00:59.130
promiscuous sexuality.
 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.698
Feeling very sorry for the
males, and I don't want them to

00:01:02.698 --> 00:01:05.140
go through too much of an ego
crush,

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.777
I have to tell you that some
cultures indeed give credit to

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:10.218
males in all of this.
 

00:01:10.218 --> 00:01:14.218
In particular,
the Barre tribe of Venezuela,

00:01:14.218 --> 00:01:20.170
who are one of the isolated
tribes in the Venezuelan Amazon,

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.378
and they believe that a woman's
body is just a vessel and that

00:01:24.378 --> 00:01:27.000
men do all the work of
reproduction.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.900
The only limitation--the very
first act of sex must be between

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.050
husband and wife.
 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.494
They have marriages but the
first copulation has to between

00:01:40.494 --> 00:01:44.250
husband and wife because that
plants the seed,

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.610
and it's very important that
the seed belong to the husband.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.800
Once he has planted the seed
the growing fetus is not done

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.265
with male need,
so the fetus obviously has to

00:01:57.265 --> 00:02:00.031
be nourished,
it's keeping to grow has to get

00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:01.030
the nourishment.
 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.683
It doesn't get the nourishment
from the mother,

00:02:03.683 --> 00:02:05.069
it gets it from semen.
 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:11.665
The fetus needs a constant
contribution of semen all along

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:13.750
to make it grow.
 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.739
The Barre claim that this is
very hard work for men to

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:17.979
support a pregnancy.
 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:22.899
They have to have sex all the
time to do this and the women

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:27.310
are worried about wearing out
their poor husbands.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.550
Now this is not just this
cultural-- just dreaming stuff

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.788
up, this has real empirical
basis and the Barre say,

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:38.652
'look it's obvious,
women grow fat during the

00:02:38.652 --> 00:02:41.550
pregnancy,
while men they grow thin from

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.792
all their work,' so they have
good reasons for believing what

00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:46.569
they do.
 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.190
What's the solution?
 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.919
Well they ask other men to help.
 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.513
The husband--they don't want to
wear out their husband,

00:02:53.513 --> 00:02:55.050
he's got to do a lot of stuff.
 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.989
They ask other men to help,
and it's strange,

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.930
even though it is such hard
work, the men seem quite willing

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.598
to pitch in and help.
 

00:03:03.598 --> 00:03:06.717
It's very nice,
it's very heartwarming that men

00:03:06.717 --> 00:03:10.040
can, at least temporarily,
stop all this male/male

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.109
competition and help another guy
when his wife needs a little

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.330
nourishment.
 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.152
When we get to discussing the
reproductive biology that

00:03:21.152 --> 00:03:26.330
relates to abortion much later
in the course,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.507
you will find that actually
Western scientific knowledge

00:03:30.507 --> 00:03:35.065
does not go much beyond what the
Barre understood until about

00:03:35.065 --> 00:03:38.560
1840 and well into the
nineteenth century.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.443
That's--until then what--how a
fetus was formed,

00:03:41.443 --> 00:03:45.065
what the male contribution was,
what the female contribution

00:03:45.065 --> 00:03:47.030
was, was a big hot argument.
 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.521
Some thought it was all woman,
some thought it was all male,

00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:52.180
and they just had no idea.
 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.548
Human fertilization was not
discovered until 1840 in the

00:03:54.548 --> 00:03:54.848
West.
 

00:03:54.848 --> 00:04:01.360
We were having the same
argument that the Barre do.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.435
Furthermore--anybody know
approximately how long it takes

00:04:06.435 --> 00:04:11.782
if a human couple wants to get
pregnant how long it takes on

00:04:11.782 --> 00:04:12.870
average?
 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.188
It's more like five months.
 

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:19.144
You'll hear--again when we
discuss abortion you'll hear the

00:04:19.144 --> 00:04:20.439
reasons for that.
 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:24.278
Actually, in that five months,
the husband gets the first

00:04:24.278 --> 00:04:27.778
copulation,
but thereafter a lot of guys

00:04:27.778 --> 00:04:31.048
have to help,
so by the time five months

00:04:31.048 --> 00:04:33.865
rolls around,
the average for getting

00:04:33.865 --> 00:04:37.351
impregnated,
an awful lot of guys have had

00:04:37.351 --> 00:04:39.120
their seed in there.
 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.379
Again, in actuality,
paternity is totally uncertain.

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:48.459
That is it comes right back to
the chimp story that the

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:52.689
community hangs together,
one reason because no one knows

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:54.879
anything about paternity.
 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:59.973
Okay, last time I was
describing how all cultures have

00:04:59.973 --> 00:05:05.547
mechanisms so that families in
fact only have about half as

00:05:05.547 --> 00:05:10.930
many children of which they're
biologically capable.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.088
Remember we did this
calculation and we found this 69

00:05:15.088 --> 00:05:16.850
number and so forth.
 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.774
I was in the middle of a story
and actually it's in your

00:05:21.774 --> 00:05:22.670
reading.
 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.444
It's reading for last Tuesday
about the Mae Enga of New

00:05:27.444 --> 00:05:28.240
Guinea.
 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.242
They believe,
the males and females both

00:05:31.242 --> 00:05:35.860
believe, that the sexual fluids
and odors and emanations from

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.480
women are dangerous and even
lethal to men.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.800
Hence, the men are terrified of
having sex with the women.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.146
Now you read this in your
reading and you may again throw

00:05:49.146 --> 00:05:54.684
it off as just one of these
cultural practices of primitive

00:05:54.684 --> 00:05:56.860
people,
and that's not the way you

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.970
should approach this class.
 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.459
You should--on the other hand
ask how does such a practice

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:01.949
arise?
 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.480
What are its roots?
 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.870
How does it help their culture
to survive?

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.415
The theory being that most of
the things that people are doing

00:06:10.415 --> 00:06:14.439
have some role in helping them
in a difficult world.

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:17.680
As you know,
in chimps as in most human

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.814
societies,
they're exogamous,

00:06:19.814 --> 00:06:22.490
that instead of the male going
out to mating,

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.740
the males stay together in one
community,

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.778
and the females go out to
mating.

00:06:27.778 --> 00:06:33.675
The same is true with the Mae
Enga, and females transfer

00:06:33.675 --> 00:06:34.639
groups.
 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.028
Also we know that,
as in chimps,

00:06:37.028 --> 00:06:41.266
in New Guinea each of these
tribes is always at constant

00:06:41.266 --> 00:06:43.810
warfare with their neighbors.
 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.899
They are truly enemies.
 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.550
When women are exchanged
between neighboring communities

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.339
they don't travel very far;
they'll get killed if they

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:59.757
travel very far,
so the only people they know

00:06:59.757 --> 00:07:03.165
are the neighboring communities
and someone from this community

00:07:03.165 --> 00:07:06.396
will marry--
will get a woman from a fairly

00:07:06.396 --> 00:07:11.048
neighboring community which
means getting a wife from their

00:07:11.048 --> 00:07:11.769
enemy.
 

00:07:11.769 --> 00:07:16.620
That's again very similar to
the chimp setup.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.319
The Mae Enga are very much
aware of this,

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:22.425
as you've read,
'we marry the people we fight,'

00:07:22.425 --> 00:07:26.610
and there's a lot of distrust
and fear of the enemy wives.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.571
Because of that,
the husband does not sleep in

00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:33.322
the hut with his wife and
children but sleeps in the men's

00:07:33.322 --> 00:07:33.850
hut.
 

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.569
It's a male bonding sort of
thing rather than a male/female

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:39.110
bonding sort of thing.
 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.641
Apparently culture has used
this distrust of the wife,

00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:48.089
this fear of the wife,
as a mechanism for restricting

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:49.800
sexual activity.
 

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.226
Of course, the Mae Enga like
every other human has

00:07:53.226 --> 00:07:57.002
tremendously strong sexual
drives but they're living on

00:07:57.002 --> 00:08:01.550
very fragile ecological land and
they can't overpopulate it,

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:06.519
so they have to have some
mechanism of tamping down

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:08.009
reproduction.
 

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:11.591
This is one of the mechanisms;
the men don't even sleep in the

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:12.838
same house with women.
 

00:08:12.838 --> 00:08:16.497
It's a rare event when the
women--when they visit the

00:08:16.497 --> 00:08:20.083
women, a rare and dangerous
event and that keeps the

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:21.420
birthrate down.
 

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.202
Now in the reading,
there's a third point that's

00:08:24.202 --> 00:08:27.697
very easy to miss because it's
just one little phrase and it

00:08:27.697 --> 00:08:29.889
talks about how dangerous sex
is.

00:08:29.889 --> 00:08:34.730
You remember who it says is
particularly vulnerable?

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.879
The young males are partic--she
remembers that.

00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:41.839
The young males are
particularly vulnerable to these

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:44.740
dangers and so their health will
be undermined,

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.090
not only by frequent
intercourse with women,

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.288
but even by frequent contact
with women.

00:08:51.288 --> 00:08:54.360
Of course the older men are
rather immune;

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.509
as you grow older you gather
immunity to this.

00:08:57.509 --> 00:09:00.340
Now we know younger males are
driven very much sexually,

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.019
older males it cools down
somewhat,

00:09:04.019 --> 00:09:08.028
and so here's this cultural
belief counteracting biology.

00:09:08.028 --> 00:09:10.129
It's the inverse of what you
would expect.

00:09:10.129 --> 00:09:14.403
You would expect the younger
men to have a lot of sex and the

00:09:14.403 --> 00:09:18.889
older men to sort of tail off on
it, but what does it insure?

00:09:18.889 --> 00:09:22.715
It insures the control by the
older, dominant,

00:09:22.715 --> 00:09:23.820
mature men.
 

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.158
Again, it goes right back,
it's the Mae Enga;

00:09:27.158 --> 00:09:32.576
it can be perceived as the Mae
Enga version of dominance

00:09:32.576 --> 00:09:35.629
hierarchy in the chimpanzees.
 

00:09:35.629 --> 00:09:38.298
Well there's an extended
description of this in the

00:09:38.298 --> 00:09:41.178
reading which is wonderful,
which I hope you've already

00:09:41.178 --> 00:09:41.659
done.
 

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.669
The--so far I've been
describing how culture,

00:09:57.669 --> 00:10:00.620
communities push fertility up,
because,

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.298
if you don't get on average
eight or so children from each

00:10:04.298 --> 00:10:05.937
woman,
the culture disappears,

00:10:05.937 --> 00:10:08.557
but they also have to push it
down because if reproduction

00:10:08.557 --> 00:10:10.350
goes too wild the children just
die.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.725
I showed you data about inter
birth interval can't get too

00:10:13.725 --> 00:10:15.678
short or the children just die.
 

00:10:15.678 --> 00:10:19.894
Individuals--that's all from
the community perspective so

00:10:19.894 --> 00:10:23.279
far--but individuals,
and individual families,

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:25.990
they have to adjust these
rules.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.457
There's these cultural rules
which are usually very strongly

00:10:28.457 --> 00:10:30.724
enforced,
but individual families

00:10:30.724 --> 00:10:34.712
have--each has a different
situation and they have to

00:10:34.712 --> 00:10:39.928
adjust the rules somehow to cope
with their individual situation.

00:10:39.928 --> 00:10:42.635
Of course this leads to
conflict between what an

00:10:42.635 --> 00:10:45.629
individual or an individual
family wants and what the

00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:47.298
culture says you must do.
 

00:10:47.298 --> 00:10:51.178
One of these examples,
I mentioned last time,

00:10:51.178 --> 00:10:54.445
is post-partum abstinence,
that in many parts for instance

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:57.081
of Africa,
after a child is born there

00:10:57.081 --> 00:11:01.357
will be three years in which a
woman is not supposed to engage

00:11:01.357 --> 00:11:02.058
is sex.
 

00:11:02.058 --> 00:11:04.928
Obviously, primarily a
mechanism for spacing births,

00:11:04.928 --> 00:11:08.323
so that the children stay alive
and the woman doesn't get killed

00:11:08.323 --> 00:11:10.480
from too much strain on her
resources.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.370
Now if you think about that a
little bit,

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:17.000
you have a young woman,
young husband,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.220
marriage is fairly young
generally,

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.304
the husband will be a good bit
older but still young and he's

00:11:22.304 --> 00:11:23.952
facing--
the wife has a kid,

00:11:23.952 --> 00:11:26.158
he has a kid,
and the wife is face--

00:11:26.158 --> 00:11:29.590
the husband now facing three
years without any sex.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.370
What is he going to do?
 

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.846
He's going to want to take a
second wife or maybe visit a lot

00:11:35.846 --> 00:11:37.759
of prostitutes and spend money.
 

00:11:37.759 --> 00:11:42.663
That's something that often the
wife--the first wife or second,

00:11:42.663 --> 00:11:47.330
or third, or wherever she is in
the chain, will not want.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.274
Sometimes she does want that
and we'll talk about polygamy

00:11:50.274 --> 00:11:53.168
later and why women very often
choose to be in polygamous

00:11:53.168 --> 00:11:56.321
relationships,
but very often she won't want

00:11:56.321 --> 00:12:00.964
him to take another wife unless
he's got a lot of money he just

00:12:00.964 --> 00:12:04.259
won't be able to help more than
one wife.

00:12:04.259 --> 00:12:06.639
What does she do?
 

00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:10.964
She has to figure out of way of
resuming sexual intercourse but

00:12:10.964 --> 00:12:12.289
not get pregnant.
 

00:12:12.289 --> 00:12:13.169
What does she use?
 

00:12:13.169 --> 00:12:16.378
Contraception;
so surprisingly in Africa,

00:12:16.378 --> 00:12:19.421
one of the major reasons for
the people accepting

00:12:19.421 --> 00:12:23.413
contraception is not a desire to
reduce fertility as in most all

00:12:23.413 --> 00:12:27.493
the rest of the world,
but a desire to resume sexual

00:12:27.493 --> 00:12:30.668
relationships without getting
pregnant.

00:12:30.668 --> 00:12:34.889
She has to do this not only to
protect herself because she

00:12:34.889 --> 00:12:39.109
knows that if she has children
too often she wears out her

00:12:39.109 --> 00:12:41.196
body,
and there's a reading on

00:12:41.196 --> 00:12:43.440
exactly what certain groups in
Africa--

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:48.000
one group in Africa considers
this wearing out of the body.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.681
Also, if she gets pregnant
right away the community knows

00:12:51.681 --> 00:12:55.100
that she and her husband have
violated the taboo,

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.730
and there's very strong social
proscriptions against--

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.860
proscriptions against violating
the taboos,

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:08.937
so contraception which you take
privately is sort of the perfect

00:13:08.937 --> 00:13:14.629
solution for women wanting to
return to sexuality but not to

00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:16.269
get pregnant.
 

00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:22.831
Another aspect which we
already--I just mentioned of

00:13:22.831 --> 00:13:29.009
control of fertility is what I
call gerontocracy,

00:13:29.009 --> 00:13:31.840
ruled by old folk.
 

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:37.750
The old folk can
monopolize--the older men,

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:42.340
can monopolize the sexual
activities of younger women,

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.640
and because they're not as
vigorous shall we say that

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.129
reduces--
is one mechanism for reducing

00:13:48.129 --> 00:13:48.808
fertility.
 

00:13:48.808 --> 00:13:53.363
One of the ways which came up
in one of the sections is the

00:13:53.363 --> 00:13:55.090
idea of bride price.
 

00:13:55.090 --> 00:14:00.033
Dowry is more commonly known is
where the wife's family pays the

00:14:00.033 --> 00:14:04.505
husband, the husband or the
husband's family when the wife

00:14:04.505 --> 00:14:05.840
gets married.
 

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.227
The reverse of that is called
bride price and it's much more

00:14:10.227 --> 00:14:12.460
common then dowry in Africa.
 

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.732
In this case,
the man or the man's family,

00:14:15.732 --> 00:14:19.884
or the man's side must pay the
father of the wife for

00:14:19.884 --> 00:14:22.600
the--before he gets the woman.
 

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.542
It's sometimes in the West
considered buying the woman but

00:14:26.542 --> 00:14:29.168
it really is not a buying
situation.

00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:35.660
These bride prices can be very
high and a young man usually

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:40.250
does not have the money to buy a
bride.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.440
Who controls the money of the
village?

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.649
Who controls the resources?
 

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:47.863
Why the older men who are the
village elders and control

00:14:47.863 --> 00:14:48.860
everything.
 

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:57.789
They dole out very sparingly
the bride price to allow men to

00:14:57.789 --> 00:14:59.908
get married.
 

00:14:59.908 --> 00:15:04.710
This is like among the Maasai
of Kenya, very tall people with

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.590
a lot of popular press about
that.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:11.721
And because the young men are
not getting married and there's

00:15:11.721 --> 00:15:14.067
roughly--
equal numbers of males and

00:15:14.067 --> 00:15:16.371
females,
that leaves a lot of excess

00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:18.572
young girls,
fertile young girls,

00:15:18.572 --> 00:15:19.830
and who gets them?
 

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.080
The older men go polygamous and
they can have several wives,

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:27.211
but remember for every man who
has more than one wife that

00:15:27.211 --> 00:15:31.269
means there's another man that
has no wife whatsoever.

00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:34.730
When you read the ethnography
of this,

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:38.386
the anthropologists who go in,
it's very clear that the young

00:15:38.386 --> 00:15:41.923
men are held in a state of
sexual frustration and the young

00:15:41.923 --> 00:15:44.850
men have ways that they talk to
each other,

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.779
and they are just on the verge
of rebellion.

00:15:47.779 --> 00:15:52.245
The strategy of the older guys
is to keep these young men just

00:15:52.245 --> 00:15:55.480
below that--
keep as much sex for themselves

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.759
but keep the young men from
getting together and rebelling.

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:03.639
They co-opt what we now
were--they co-opt the young guys

00:16:03.639 --> 00:16:07.308
when the older more dominant of
the younger guys,

00:16:07.308 --> 00:16:10.019
when things start to get out of
hand a little bit,

00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:14.091
we now have bride price,
and you can go and get married

00:16:14.091 --> 00:16:18.692
and that co-opts him and takes
him out of the cabal that might

00:16:18.692 --> 00:16:20.879
start a small revolution.
 

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:26.653
This is all going on subtly,
often hidden within these

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:28.179
communities.
 

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.129
These are large--affects this
whole polygamist situation.

00:16:36.129 --> 00:16:39.597
In much of West Africa almost
half of all wives are in

00:16:39.597 --> 00:16:43.589
polygamous marriages and that
means about half of the men have

00:16:43.589 --> 00:16:45.158
no wives whatsoever.
 

00:16:45.158 --> 00:16:49.005
And in the 1920s--so a lot of
what I'm describing is

00:16:49.005 --> 00:16:53.080
traditional culture and we all
know that the whole--

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.110
everywhere in the world is
changing very rapidly,

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.700
but you can't understand where
they're going unless you know

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:58.928
where they're coming from.
 

00:16:58.928 --> 00:17:02.277
In the 1920s,
40% of the men got to be 40

00:17:02.277 --> 00:17:06.210
years old without having been
able to marry,

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:09.442
so that's almost half your
population without

00:17:09.442 --> 00:17:13.260
"legitimate sexual
outlet" until they're 40

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.288
years old.
 

00:17:14.288 --> 00:17:17.231
Today, even today,
and this is from a few years

00:17:17.231 --> 00:17:20.430
ago,
the median age of marriage is

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:25.363
still almost 30 and great
pressure and power from the

00:17:25.363 --> 00:17:31.150
older guys is necessary to
maintain a situation like that.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:35.057
They also leave sort of a
pressure valve on this whole

00:17:35.057 --> 00:17:38.892
situation that they don't
totally suppress the sexual

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:40.808
activity of young men.
 

00:17:40.808 --> 00:17:44.108
They turn a blind eye to a fair
amount of prostitution;

00:17:44.108 --> 00:17:49.005
that's reasonably accepted,
and to "discrete access to

00:17:49.005 --> 00:17:53.309
the younger wives of older
brothers or even of their

00:17:53.309 --> 00:17:54.828
fathers."
 

00:17:54.828 --> 00:17:57.986
Again there's the dominant
males who are sort of officially

00:17:57.986 --> 00:18:00.980
in charge, but there's a lot of
extra stuff going on.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.490
Again, it's the great ape kind
of pattern.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:11.431
Even today, this story of the
dominant older males getting the

00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:15.868
most sex has by no means
disappeared.

00:18:15.868 --> 00:18:24.741
Now it gets a little more
unpleasant because this control

00:18:24.741 --> 00:18:33.140
of population by pre- is very
often post-pregnancy.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.999
We've described so far all
kinds of pre-pregnancy

00:18:36.999 --> 00:18:40.886
mechanisms reducing sex,
etc., but women still get

00:18:40.886 --> 00:18:45.146
pregnant and very often they or
their families decide that they

00:18:45.146 --> 00:18:47.140
can't have these children.
 

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:53.182
A lot of this is post-pregnancy
population control and even--and

00:18:53.182 --> 00:18:54.910
post-natal also.
 

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:58.971
Abortion and infanticide are
common among--or have been

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:02.130
recently--among almost all human
groups.

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:06.250
Different communities and
different individual families

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:10.828
have a different amount of
resources and they must match,

00:19:10.828 --> 00:19:14.096
in some way,
match their fertility to the

00:19:14.096 --> 00:19:16.630
resources that are available.
 

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:21.988
This is a very discussed and
studied topic in population

00:19:21.988 --> 00:19:24.990
circles,
so a few years back Karen

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:29.317
Mason, who was president of the
Population Association of

00:19:29.317 --> 00:19:33.875
America gave a wonderful quote
about how people adjust their

00:19:33.875 --> 00:19:35.190
family size.
 

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.769
"Parents kill their
infants,

00:19:37.769 --> 00:19:40.635
abandon them,
neglect them in the hopes that

00:19:40.635 --> 00:19:43.749
they will die,
give them into the care of wet

00:19:43.749 --> 00:19:48.040
nurses where they usually die,
sell them, give them up for

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.721
adoption,
marry them off at a young age,

00:19:50.721 --> 00:19:53.348
loan them to other families for
fostering,

00:19:53.348 --> 00:19:56.519
send them into service,
or into other households,

00:19:56.519 --> 00:19:58.960
send them to the military,
the merchant marine,

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.234
prostitution,
or send them overseas as

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:03.740
migrants."
 

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.983
All of these are very standard
mechanisms for individual

00:20:07.983 --> 00:20:12.615
families controlling the number
of children that they have to

00:20:12.615 --> 00:20:13.308
rear.
 

00:20:13.308 --> 00:20:18.073
In Western culture it's
certainly not unknown,

00:20:18.073 --> 00:20:21.990
the founding myth of Jewish
people?

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:23.819
Moses.
 

00:20:23.819 --> 00:20:25.278
What happened to Moses?
 

00:20:25.278 --> 00:20:27.301
He's a baby;
he's thrown in the basket,

00:20:27.301 --> 00:20:28.578
floated down the Nile.
 

00:20:28.578 --> 00:20:31.077
You go to China,
a very standard way of getting

00:20:31.077 --> 00:20:34.311
rid of children--
everywhere--every culture that

00:20:34.311 --> 00:20:36.734
has a river,
babies are put in baskets and

00:20:36.734 --> 00:20:39.430
floated down the river as a way
of getting rid of them.

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.690
Of course the Bible story that
the Pharaoh's daughter finds

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.894
this baby floating down the
river and you can believe that

00:20:45.894 --> 00:20:47.377
or not,
but obviously,

00:20:47.377 --> 00:20:50.438
that sort of behavior of
putting a newborn infant in a

00:20:50.438 --> 00:20:54.018
basket and floating him down the
river was apparently extremely

00:20:54.018 --> 00:20:57.884
common at that time,
so the story wouldn't have been

00:20:57.884 --> 00:20:58.798
surprising.
 

00:20:58.798 --> 00:20:59.750
Student:  There is one
minor difference.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:03.132
Moses mother didn't want to
kill him, on the contrary,

00:21:03.132 --> 00:21:04.920
she wanted him to survive.
 

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.170
Prof: That's the story.
 

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.040
Student:  Yeah,
because the Pharaoh would have

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.308
had him killed otherwise--as all
the Jewish boys were killed.

00:21:10.308 --> 00:21:11.941
Prof: Yeah,
if you read the

00:21:11.941 --> 00:21:14.462
original--you're completely
correct, if you read the

00:21:14.462 --> 00:21:16.045
original story it reads as if 1.
 

00:21:16.045 --> 00:21:18.863
She wanted to keep him alive
and Pharaoh was going to kill

00:21:18.863 --> 00:21:19.653
them all, and 2.
 

00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:22.472
that she saw the princess sort
of on the other side of the

00:21:22.472 --> 00:21:25.440
river and thought that the
princess would see it,

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.410
so you can interpret the story
as you want,

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:30.817
but it's a very standard
multi--many, many cultures,

00:21:30.817 --> 00:21:34.227
cross-cultural mechanism of
infanticide and there it

00:21:34.227 --> 00:21:35.029
appears.
 

00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:38.730
What is the founding myth of
the Roman people?

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:39.240
Students:
 Romulus and Remus.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.130
Prof: Romulus and Remus;
what's the story of Romulus and

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:42.618
Remus?
 

00:21:42.618 --> 00:21:45.769
Student:  Raised by a
wolf.

00:21:45.769 --> 00:21:48.773
Prof: Raised by a wolf,
so Romulus and Remus

00:21:48.773 --> 00:21:52.077
twins--we'll talk about twins in
a moment, left out on a

00:21:52.077 --> 00:21:54.673
hillside;
standard form everywhere in the

00:21:54.673 --> 00:21:57.432
world of abandonment,
you know some animal will eat

00:21:57.432 --> 00:22:00.160
it, but in this case the wolves
didn't eat the babies,

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.400
they suckled them and they came
up to found the Roman Empire.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:10.195
Sure, so it's quite interesting
how many of the founding myths

00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:14.430
have this abandonment story in
them.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.788
With respect to twins,
for instance,

00:22:16.788 --> 00:22:19.180
the Uwa tribe who were very
traditional,

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.868
isolated people in Columbia and
South America,

00:22:21.868 --> 00:22:25.650
when they have twins they
abandon them in the forest or

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:29.354
toss them into the rivers,
and their cultural belief is

00:22:29.354 --> 00:22:30.910
that they bring bad luck.
 

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:34.553
Of course in this situation
where a mother is undernourished

00:22:34.553 --> 00:22:37.950
she probably is going to have
difficulty bringing up one

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:41.534
child,
and two is just kind of

00:22:41.534 --> 00:22:43.048
impossible.
 

00:22:43.048 --> 00:22:46.371
If she believes,
or the culture has sort of over

00:22:46.371 --> 00:22:50.470
history figured out that the
children are going to die,

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.833
one or both of them,
then the amount of resources

00:22:53.833 --> 00:22:58.037
put into trying to raise a child
who you know is going to die

00:22:58.037 --> 00:23:00.420
anyway is just not acceptable.
 

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:04.769
Of course none of this is a
conscious calculation.

00:23:04.769 --> 00:23:08.250
If you ask the people why
they're doing it,

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.210
they always give some kind of
religious or mystical,

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:13.259
or magical kind of
interpretation to this behavior,

00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:19.102
but we can see it as one of the
mechanisms for having families

00:23:19.102 --> 00:23:25.038
limit their fertility to what
they think they can cope with.

00:23:25.038 --> 00:23:28.190
In addition to controlling the
rate of reproduction,

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:31.278
the control of population
continues after birth.

00:23:31.278 --> 00:23:35.462
We haven't talked about
abortion, but during pregnancy

00:23:35.462 --> 00:23:38.618
via abortion,
we'll get to that later.

00:23:38.618 --> 00:23:43.724
Societies are also really very
careful about controlling the

00:23:43.724 --> 00:23:46.838
number of child bearers and
they--

00:23:46.838 --> 00:23:51.316
in England, for instance,
and we'll talk a little more

00:23:51.316 --> 00:23:55.480
about this at a later time,
people couldn't marry.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:00.642
The peasant on somebody's
estate could not get permission

00:24:00.642 --> 00:24:06.080
to marry unless he had enough
property to support a wife and

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.278
children.
 

00:24:07.278 --> 00:24:10.646
Very often this meant that he
couldn't marry until his father

00:24:10.646 --> 00:24:11.038
died.
 

00:24:11.038 --> 00:24:14.377
The father was living in the
house and he just had to wait

00:24:14.377 --> 00:24:17.892
until the father dies and then
he was owner of this property,

00:24:17.892 --> 00:24:19.650
then he could take a wife.
 

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:24.380
Well the father dies when the
guy is maybe 40 or late 30s,

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:28.108
and so that cuts down his
reproductive potential a lot,

00:24:28.108 --> 00:24:32.078
and of course the wife that he
marries has not been married up

00:24:32.078 --> 00:24:34.969
until then,
so her reproductive potential

00:24:34.969 --> 00:24:36.880
has also been knocked down.
 

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.760
In many ways,
since the fertility of a

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:46.424
society basically does not
depend on the number of men,

00:24:46.424 --> 00:24:51.460
it depends primarily on the
number of women.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:55.625
We saw this--last time we
discussed the permissibility of

00:24:55.625 --> 00:25:00.089
polygamy even with limitations
when a lot of men are dying in

00:25:00.089 --> 00:25:04.343
war,
but this happens in many,

00:25:04.343 --> 00:25:06.778
many situations.
 

00:25:06.778 --> 00:25:10.575
In India, as you know,
traditionally it's almost never

00:25:10.575 --> 00:25:12.078
practiced nowadays.
 

00:25:12.078 --> 00:25:15.779
A man dies, what happens to the
wife?

00:25:15.779 --> 00:25:17.930
Sacrificed on the funeral pyre.
 

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.489
Again, there's all kinds of
religious and cultural

00:25:20.489 --> 00:25:23.308
explanations for it which the
people will tell you,

00:25:23.308 --> 00:25:25.769
but standing back from it among
other things,

00:25:25.769 --> 00:25:31.558
it's a way of controlling the
birthrate of the population.

00:25:31.558 --> 00:25:35.558
Sometimes in a single
geographical setting you can see

00:25:35.558 --> 00:25:38.880
the two different things working
together.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.690
The Mae Enga,
which you've already heard

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:45.221
about in New Guinea,
they live in an overpopulated

00:25:45.221 --> 00:25:46.230
territory.
 

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:50.132
They are pressing up against
the ecological limits of their

00:25:50.132 --> 00:25:50.940
resources.
 

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:57.037
The women are severely degraded;
funerals are held to honor men

00:25:57.037 --> 00:26:01.130
and pigs, but not women or
children.

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:04.210
If a husband dies,
if a man dies,

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:09.410
his widow is strangled within
24 hours of his death.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:13.038
On the same island,
New Guinea, the Fore people

00:26:13.038 --> 00:26:15.170
have a different problem.
 

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.278
They have kuru,
which we now call Creutzfeldt

00:26:18.278 --> 00:26:21.577
Jakob Disease,
a prion that destroys the brain

00:26:21.577 --> 00:26:25.436
so they have a very high death
rate and their territory is

00:26:25.436 --> 00:26:29.190
quite under populated;
they have great difficulty in

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:31.818
getting enough people to stay
alive.

00:26:31.818 --> 00:26:35.301
In that culture,
where everybody is scarce,

00:26:35.301 --> 00:26:39.200
they mourn women and children
as much as men;

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:43.009
they encourage premarital sex,
and widows are not killed but

00:26:43.009 --> 00:26:46.108
immediately courted for
remarriage by the men.

00:26:46.108 --> 00:26:50.300
Again, this is a society when
you're way below the limit,

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:54.867
then you want to keep a woman's
womb full and you want to keep

00:26:54.867 --> 00:26:56.440
them reproducing.
 

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:00.595
I've told you this mechanism
for reducing the number of child

00:27:00.595 --> 00:27:03.809
bearers is severe,
very severe around the world,

00:27:03.809 --> 00:27:06.420
and I mentioned and you'll hear
it again,

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.680
that the estimates that there
are by various mechanisms of

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:13.000
discrimination against women,
there's a hundred million women

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.297
missing in the world and this is
a big part of the global control

00:27:19.297 --> 00:27:20.970
of population.
 

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:24.984
We've seen some people and a
lot of the popular discussion

00:27:24.984 --> 00:27:27.996
thinks that fertility control,
contraception,

00:27:27.996 --> 00:27:30.984
all that is a new thing that's
burst in 1960 or something when

00:27:30.984 --> 00:27:33.815
the pill was invented--
that it just burst on the world

00:27:33.815 --> 00:27:36.675
and some people think it's
wonderful and some people think

00:27:36.675 --> 00:27:38.633
it's immoral,
but in fact,

00:27:38.633 --> 00:27:43.784
cultures have always had
mechanisms for controlling their

00:27:43.784 --> 00:27:44.980
fertility.
 

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:52.650
They've often been more brutal
then what we currently have.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:59.108
I want to shift gears a little
bit.

00:27:59.108 --> 00:28:02.262
It follows along the following
way: so we've been talking about

00:28:02.262 --> 00:28:04.400
the way people regulate their
fertility.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.578
What is the main limitation on
fertility?

00:28:08.578 --> 00:28:11.888
Well it's often food,
and food depends on how much

00:28:11.888 --> 00:28:12.970
land you have.
 

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:17.950
Most of what we read in history
and what we're used to thinking

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:23.011
of human society has to do with
very crowded places from Europe,

00:28:23.011 --> 00:28:24.858
or China, or India.
 

00:28:24.858 --> 00:28:28.490
In historical times all of
these places have had very

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:31.144
high--historically
compared--very high,

00:28:31.144 --> 00:28:33.029
even dense populations.
 

00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:39.618
In all of these cultures you
have masses of peasants without

00:28:39.618 --> 00:28:41.989
any land,
landless peasants,

00:28:41.989 --> 00:28:44.672
called land hunger,
everybody wants land and there

00:28:44.672 --> 00:28:47.098
isn't land for it,
they fight over land,

00:28:47.098 --> 00:28:50.392
if you manage to own land,
you're going to be very rich

00:28:50.392 --> 00:28:51.840
from land,
you don't have to work it

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.376
yourself,
there's always plenty of

00:28:53.376 --> 00:28:55.740
landless peasants that can do
the work for you,

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.858
and so forth.
 

00:28:58.858 --> 00:29:02.645
This is pretty much true
of--pretty much the characters

00:29:02.645 --> 00:29:06.196
of recent human history,
but for most of human history

00:29:06.196 --> 00:29:09.150
that was not true at all,
the opposite was true.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:13.559
The world was open and there
was plenty of land available.

00:29:13.559 --> 00:29:17.584
We were not a numerous species;
we had almost no population

00:29:17.584 --> 00:29:21.450
growth rate, and so what was
scarce was not land,

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:25.395
land was plentiful,
but what was scarce was people

00:29:25.395 --> 00:29:27.410
to fill up the land.
 

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:32.328
Cultures have been aware of
this problem,

00:29:32.328 --> 00:29:34.441
as well as the opposite
problem, but this problem for a

00:29:34.441 --> 00:29:36.838
long time,
so one of the great Chinese

00:29:36.838 --> 00:29:40.281
philosophers,
Mo Zi (Mo Tzu) fifth century

00:29:40.281 --> 00:29:40.710
B.C.
 

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:42.788
wrote, "What is hard to
increase?"

00:29:42.788 --> 00:29:46.712
He's talking about politics and
everything, "Only people

00:29:46.712 --> 00:29:48.608
are hard to increase."
 

00:29:48.608 --> 00:29:52.529
He argues--he says that there
are policies which can increase

00:29:52.529 --> 00:29:53.380
population.
 

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:58.106
"The kings of old required
that all men marry by the age of

00:29:58.106 --> 00:30:01.259
19 and all women marry by the
age of 14.

00:30:01.259 --> 00:30:03.880
Now those who want to marry
early marry at 20;

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.528
those who want to marry late,
marry as late as 40.

00:30:07.528 --> 00:30:12.344
We can expect two or three more
children to survive if we were

00:30:12.344 --> 00:30:14.868
to reduce the age of marriage.
 

00:30:14.868 --> 00:30:18.153
Through universal marriage we
should be able to increase the

00:30:18.153 --> 00:30:19.490
population size."
 

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:23.094
This is his advice to the
rulers on how to increase the

00:30:23.094 --> 00:30:25.230
population in their territory.
 

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:27.880
There's plenty of land,
that's not a problem.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.674
They have to be strong because
there's neighboring warring

00:30:29.674 --> 00:30:31.130
states,
they're always fighting with

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:33.694
each other,
if they don't have a big

00:30:33.694 --> 00:30:38.700
population their neighbors will
come in and wipe them out.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:42.736
Of course this idea that the
government should be an agent of

00:30:42.736 --> 00:30:46.369
control of the population again
has not disappeared;

00:30:46.369 --> 00:30:48.318
China does it now.
 

00:30:48.318 --> 00:30:50.476
In the old days they wanted to
use the government and did

00:30:50.476 --> 00:30:52.710
sometimes use the government to
increase the population.

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:56.342
China now wants to use it to
decrease the population,

00:30:56.342 --> 00:31:00.463
but it's the same idea that
control in one way or another is

00:31:00.463 --> 00:31:02.700
important for every society.
 

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:07.353
In this--the rest of this
lecture, we'll see how long it

00:31:07.353 --> 00:31:10.509
takes;
we're going to talk about under

00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:12.269
population of places.
 

00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:14.558
The examples are largely going
to come from the tropics,

00:31:14.558 --> 00:31:17.220
and especially we're going to
talk about Africa,

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:21.022
and that is because until
recently the tropics have

00:31:21.022 --> 00:31:23.990
generally not had a dense
population.

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:27.480
They have been what you might
call under-populated.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.960
People were scarce.
 

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.608
Up to now we've been talking
about--

00:31:33.608 --> 00:31:37.440
we talked about biological
determinants of population size,

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.685
of reproduction,
we've talked about cultural

00:31:39.685 --> 00:31:40.470
determinants.
 

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:43.348
There's another whole big
factor: geographical

00:31:43.348 --> 00:31:44.308
determinants.
 

00:31:44.308 --> 00:31:48.957
And we're going to talk about
three very important

00:31:48.957 --> 00:31:53.509
geographical determinants of
population size,

00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:57.910
and largely we're using the
tropics as an example of this.

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:01.740
The tropics generally have low
agricultural productivity.

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:05.558
The great granaries of the
world are not in the tropics.

00:32:05.558 --> 00:32:09.396
They have parasitic diseases
which are endemic,

00:32:09.396 --> 00:32:14.151
and geographically they're
often isolated from the rest of

00:32:14.151 --> 00:32:15.818
cultural worlds.
 

00:32:15.818 --> 00:32:27.798
This is the--just a general map
of Africa and what you see is,

00:32:27.798 --> 00:32:31.548
this is very standard,
here is the equator and--

00:32:31.548 --> 00:32:37.640
I'm sorry here is--no this is
the equator up here,

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.818
so what you have is in
Sub-Saharan Africa,

00:32:40.818 --> 00:32:44.108
well in all of Africa,
you have in the center a rain

00:32:44.108 --> 00:32:44.690
forest.
 

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:50.624
This is the very traditional
jungle and it's flanked north by

00:32:50.624 --> 00:32:55.568
the Sahara Desert,
south by the Kalahari Desert.

00:32:55.568 --> 00:33:00.410
Then here is another green zone
right along the ocean and the

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:04.207
very north,
this is Tunisia and Algeria,

00:33:04.207 --> 00:33:08.125
Morocco--
just the coastal sections of

00:33:08.125 --> 00:33:12.259
Africa are green,
they have rain.

00:33:12.259 --> 00:33:15.229
We're not going to talk about
North Africa because that's

00:33:15.229 --> 00:33:18.411
included in the Mediterranean
world, just culturally that the

00:33:18.411 --> 00:33:19.788
Sahara Desert divides.
 

00:33:19.788 --> 00:33:22.880
We're going to talk about
Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.690
You may note that these deserts
continue into Saudi Arabia,

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:30.344
then into the Sind Desert of
Pakistan and the Rajasthan

00:33:30.344 --> 00:33:33.481
Desert of India,
and then the Himalayas

00:33:33.481 --> 00:33:38.028
interrupt it but you get the
Gobi Desert up here and it

00:33:38.028 --> 00:33:42.575
continues across and in the
Americas there's the Amazon

00:33:42.575 --> 00:33:46.618
around the equator,
a very dense jungle,

00:33:46.618 --> 00:33:51.470
and what's the desert to the
north of the Amazon?

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:55.021
The Sonora Desert of Mexico,
New Mexico, Arizona,

00:33:55.021 --> 00:33:59.388
that desert is in the similar
geographical position to this,

00:33:59.388 --> 00:34:01.240
it moves up and down.
 

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:06.150
What's the southern desert in
South America?

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:10.226
The Atacama Desert of Chile and
you go over the Andes and it's

00:34:10.226 --> 00:34:13.099
not quite as desert but it's the
Pampas,

00:34:13.099 --> 00:34:18.869
which is a very dry region in
Argentina,

00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:21.110
so all over the world you have
this--

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:24.210
a central zone around the
equator which is extremely wet,

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:28.898
flanked by desert zones,
and then once out of the desert

00:34:28.898 --> 00:34:32.480
zones you get a moderate
rainfall again.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:36.518
Quickly, the reason for this is
quite simple.

00:34:36.518 --> 00:34:42.420
This is the tropics,
heat comes down,

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:44.494
the hot air rises,
it's the hottest part of the

00:34:44.494 --> 00:34:46.382
earth,
so the hot air rises,

00:34:46.382 --> 00:34:49.489
bringing up the moisture from
the tropics,

00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:54.253
as it rises it cools,
what happens as hot air-- hot

00:34:54.253 --> 00:34:55.969
moist air cools?
 

00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:58.719
Rain, so this is a very rainy
region.

00:34:58.719 --> 00:35:02.130
Now the air has risen,
it's dropped out its moisture,

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:05.505
it's dry air,
the air that continues to rise

00:35:05.505 --> 00:35:09.217
pushes it away,
so it goes either north or goes

00:35:09.217 --> 00:35:11.159
south,
and it now by the time it

00:35:11.159 --> 00:35:13.860
reaches somewhat farther away
it's cooled a lot,

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.911
it's dry because it lost its
rain, so now you have cool dry

00:35:16.911 --> 00:35:18.695
air,
and because this region is

00:35:18.695 --> 00:35:21.690
sucking air back in there's a
little bit of a vacuum,

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:26.710
the air falls back down as cold
from being up here,

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:30.309
cold dry air,
and you get the desert regions.

00:35:30.309 --> 00:35:33.860
They happen in the north and
they happen in the south so you

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.570
get deserts here,
and you get deserts here.

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:39.036
This is just a characteristic
of the whole world,

00:35:39.036 --> 00:35:41.400
and of course this is
interrupted by oceans;

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.742
this is interrupted by
something like the Himalaya

00:35:43.742 --> 00:35:47.628
Mountains so there's a lot of--
it's not a perfect schema but

00:35:47.628 --> 00:35:52.090
it explains an awful lot of the
geography of the earth.

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:54.880
In this schema,
as I've just showed you,

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:59.320
in Africa, look how much of it
is taken up with that schema.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.675
It's from here,
from the north edge of the

00:36:01.675 --> 00:36:04.949
Sahara Desert to the south edge
of the Kalahari Desert.

00:36:04.949 --> 00:36:08.980
It turns out its 97% of Africa
or something;

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:13.880
93% of Africa lies in one of
those regions;

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:18.565
a very wet jungle or too dry
and you just have a very thin

00:36:18.565 --> 00:36:20.916
region here,
and some region here,

00:36:20.916 --> 00:36:23.679
which gets some of the monsoon
circulation of air,

00:36:23.679 --> 00:36:28.349
of warm air out of the ocean.
 

00:36:28.349 --> 00:36:34.090
We have the image of the wet
tropics anyway as extremely lush

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:40.119
and fertile and you think what a
wonderful place for farming.

00:36:40.119 --> 00:36:42.329
It's a tropical paradise.
 

00:36:42.329 --> 00:36:44.900
Actually nothing is farther
from the truth;

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:49.222
the tropics are generally very
difficult to farm and if you do

00:36:49.222 --> 00:36:52.909
farm them, they're very poorly
productive regions.

00:36:52.909 --> 00:36:55.280
Why is this?
 

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.541
How many of you are aware of
that, that the tropics are not

00:36:58.541 --> 00:36:59.610
good for farming?
 

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:02.929
All you Forestry guys ought to
be aware of this.

00:37:02.929 --> 00:37:12.880
The reason is that the soils
are very bad and they're bad for

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:16.530
a number of reasons.
 

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:18.780
Well let's go back a little bit.
 

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:23.518
Plant growth is very rarely
limited by sunlight.

00:37:23.518 --> 00:37:27.230
What the tropics have is plenty
of sunlight but it's very rare

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:30.090
that that is the limitation on
plant growth,

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:34.298
so the most productive part of
the world is in terms of

00:37:34.298 --> 00:37:35.780
bio-productivity?
 

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.197
The ocean around
Antarctica--very,

00:37:38.197 --> 00:37:41.789
very cold region in terms of
intensity of sun,

00:37:41.789 --> 00:37:44.454
every part of the world gets
the same number of hours of

00:37:44.454 --> 00:37:47.029
sunlight in a year,
but the intensity around

00:37:47.029 --> 00:37:50.090
Antarctica is very much less,
so there's very little

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:52.820
sunlight, yet you get these
tremendous algal blooms,

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.670
the krill eat them,
the whales eat the krill,

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:57.590
and it's a tremendous
productive region.

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:57.797
Why?
 

00:37:57.797 --> 00:37:59.679
It has nothing to do with
sunlight;

00:37:59.679 --> 00:38:01.500
it has nothing to do with
temperature.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:04.070
You have Antarctica,
the continent of Antarctica,

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:07.659
which has rock down below it,
it's not like the North Pole,

00:38:07.659 --> 00:38:12.179
there's rock there and the
glaciers slide down to the sea

00:38:12.179 --> 00:38:14.280
and they grind the rock.
 

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.630
Where the glacier is
coming--falling into the sea,

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:22.123
underneath is a layer of what
they call glacier flour and

00:38:22.123 --> 00:38:24.849
that's ground rock,
falls into the sea,

00:38:24.849 --> 00:38:27.065
fertilizes the sea,
tremendously

00:38:27.065 --> 00:38:33.139
valuable--tremendously nutrient
rich and then that circulates up

00:38:33.139 --> 00:38:37.076
the west coast of Chile,
for instance the pacific coast

00:38:37.076 --> 00:38:38.668
of Chile,
the Humboldt current you may

00:38:38.668 --> 00:38:41.085
have heard of,
brings up all these nutrients

00:38:41.085 --> 00:38:44.983
and the richest fishing banks in
the world are off Peru where the

00:38:44.983 --> 00:38:48.514
Humboldt current comes up and
brings all these nutrients to

00:38:48.514 --> 00:38:49.550
the surface.
 

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:53.630
All over the world nutrients
are almost always what limit

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:54.650
agriculture.
 

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:56.909
Well what's the story in the
tropics?

00:38:56.909 --> 00:39:02.594
The soil may have started with
a lot of nutrients at some time

00:39:02.594 --> 00:39:04.855
back,
but the rains come,

00:39:04.855 --> 00:39:08.521
a huge amount of rain,
and what does rain do,

00:39:08.521 --> 00:39:11.070
washes the nutrients back away.
 

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:16.800
In most places nutrients are
recovered by several mechanisms.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:22.434
One is by mountains being
eroded down, that the mountains

00:39:22.434 --> 00:39:23.239
erode.
 

00:39:23.239 --> 00:39:25.659
In February,
I was in the Peruvian Amazon

00:39:25.659 --> 00:39:29.291
and you're sitting there right
in the shadow of the Andes and

00:39:29.291 --> 00:39:33.027
the rains come into the Andes,
erode the rock,

00:39:33.027 --> 00:39:39.170
and parts of the Amazon have
rich water flowing through it

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:42.190
with the Andes nutrients.
 

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:46.880
Most of the Amazon is flat,
does not have any runoff from

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.063
the Andes Mountains,
infertile as hell,

00:39:50.063 --> 00:39:51.989
no nutrients there.
 

00:39:51.989 --> 00:39:55.715
How does the jungle--so you
have this nutrient poor soil,

00:39:55.715 --> 00:39:59.440
if you go there you'll see the
soil is extremely thin.

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:03.280
You take your boot and you kick
it and a few--

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:07.505
an inch or two and there's no
soil left and if you look at the

00:40:07.505 --> 00:40:09.936
trees,
what do the roots of tropical

00:40:09.936 --> 00:40:11.369
trees often look like?
 

00:40:11.369 --> 00:40:14.340
These huge things because
there's not enough soil to

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:17.559
support them on deep roots,
there's nothing down there,

00:40:17.559 --> 00:40:20.391
so they spread out and
hopefully stay upright because

00:40:20.391 --> 00:40:23.829
with these huge,
huge buttressed kind of roots.

00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:27.215
Everything is telling you,
if you know how to look at

00:40:27.215 --> 00:40:31.320
everything, it's telling you
that this is thin and poor soil.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.682
Nevertheless,
there's all this biomass in the

00:40:34.682 --> 00:40:39.576
jungle and the mechanism is that
the whole floor of the jungle is

00:40:39.576 --> 00:40:42.990
covered with a fungus,
with a fungal mat,

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:47.625
when a leaf falls and it's wet,
and so then it's never--cannot

00:40:47.625 --> 00:40:51.289
fall far from a fungus because
they're everywhere.

00:40:51.289 --> 00:40:55.154
The fungal hyphae,
the sort of root of the fungus

00:40:55.154 --> 00:40:59.822
in a sense, invades the leaf and
very rapidly sucks out its

00:40:59.822 --> 00:41:00.949
nutrients.
 

00:41:00.949 --> 00:41:02.570
What does it do with those
nutrients?

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:07.184
Well one end of the fungus is
attached to the decaying leaves

00:41:07.184 --> 00:41:09.800
and other stuff that falls down.
 

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.907
The other end is attached to
the trees, and it gives these

00:41:12.907 --> 00:41:14.269
nutrients to the trees.
 

00:41:14.269 --> 00:41:16.570
Why is it so generous?
 

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:20.400
Well the trees must be giving
something to the fungus.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.090
Well the trees are up there in
sunlight.

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:24.130
The jungle floor is dark.
 

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:27.262
The canopy of the forest let's
very little sunlight in,

00:41:27.262 --> 00:41:30.219
so they can't photosynthesize
down at the bottom.

00:41:30.219 --> 00:41:34.695
It's--there's not a lot of
grass and stuff under jungle

00:41:34.695 --> 00:41:35.360
trees.
 

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:38.969
The trees make the sugars
through photosynthesis,

00:41:38.969 --> 00:41:42.179
they send them down,
pass them to the fungus,

00:41:42.179 --> 00:41:43.864
the fungus decays and
everything else sends the

00:41:43.864 --> 00:41:45.110
nutrients back up into the tree.
 

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:49.409
It's a wonderful cycle and so
basically all the nutrients are

00:41:49.409 --> 00:41:52.346
up in the jungle canopy,
up in the forest,

00:41:52.346 --> 00:41:53.780
not in the soil.
 

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:59.800
This stuff, this decaying
vegetable matter is the source

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:05.929
of fertility and you measure how
much of it there is,

00:42:05.929 --> 00:42:10.090
and the productivity of the
soil depends very closely to the

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:14.333
percent and depth of the humus,
this stuff is called humus in

00:42:14.333 --> 00:42:14.969
the soil.
 

00:42:14.969 --> 00:42:20.083
In tropical soils it's less
than 2% of the soil that things

00:42:20.083 --> 00:42:21.760
live in is humus.
 

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.260
In temperate soils it's always
over 10%;

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:28.074
in upper New York state or Ohio
it's 10% to 12%,

00:42:28.074 --> 00:42:31.969
and the richest Iowa farmlands
it's up to 16%.

00:42:31.969 --> 00:42:35.099
So you can see the productivity
of Iowa is just going to be--

00:42:35.099 --> 00:42:37.641
just from the soil
consideration--there's going to

00:42:37.641 --> 00:42:40.860
be an awful lot greater than the
productivity of the Amazon.

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:46.929
Another thing is the rapidity
of decay aside--

00:42:46.929 --> 00:42:49.090
anything that the fungus
doesn't get,

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:53.273
which is rare,
decays by bacteria and maybe

00:42:53.273 --> 00:42:57.260
other fungi that don't feed the
trees.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:00.827
It's hot, it's hot all the time
in the Amazon,

00:43:00.827 --> 00:43:05.030
and what does temperature do to
chemical reactions?

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:07.793
Speeds them up,
so for every ten degrees warmer

00:43:07.793 --> 00:43:11.039
the chemical reaction in general
goes twice as fast.

00:43:11.039 --> 00:43:14.815
In a jungle floor--in a jungle
you'll have maybe 30 degrees

00:43:14.815 --> 00:43:19.367
higher than New York state,
than Ohio, or Iowa so that's

00:43:19.367 --> 00:43:22.300
two, four,
eight--decay will go eight

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.940
times as fast as in say New York
or in my backyard;

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:29.063
to say nothing of the absence
of the winter where decay

00:43:29.063 --> 00:43:31.030
basically doesn't happen at all.
 

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:34.800
I know I make a mulch pile and
it takes four years.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.949
When I put in a leaf,
four years later it's down to

00:43:37.949 --> 00:43:40.086
good soil,
and then takes more years,

00:43:40.086 --> 00:43:42.974
I don't know how many before
that turns all back to carbon

00:43:42.974 --> 00:43:44.039
dioxide and water.
 

00:43:44.039 --> 00:43:47.230
The whole thing is organic;
the whole thing eventually goes

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.610
away.
 

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:53.260
In a jungle it happens much,
much more quickly.

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:56.193
To summarize all this,
this is--you've got to have

00:43:56.193 --> 00:43:57.989
some biology in this course.
 

00:43:57.989 --> 00:44:04.987
What is--which is more fertile,
the Sahara Desert or the Amazon

00:44:04.987 --> 00:44:05.889
Basin?
 

00:44:05.889 --> 00:44:08.320
The answer is really surprising.
 

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.726
There's a quote,
"Annually millions of tons

00:44:11.726 --> 00:44:15.711
of dust from the Sahara are
blown by the northeast trade

00:44:15.711 --> 00:44:18.543
winds,
thousands of kilometers across

00:44:18.543 --> 00:44:19.900
the Atlantic Ocean.
 

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:23.090
There they settle upon the
Amazon.

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:26.206
Some scientists suggest that
this is one of the major sources

00:44:26.206 --> 00:44:29.219
of soil nutrients for the poor
soil of the Amazon."

00:44:29.219 --> 00:44:34.000
It's really--and not a mild
situation;

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.755
it's very extreme,
if nutrients from the Sahara

00:44:36.755 --> 00:44:39.992
can blow a few thousand miles
and drop in and be a very

00:44:39.992 --> 00:44:43.050
significant source of nutrients
for the Amazon.

00:44:49.079 --> 00:44:52.239
Now, what happens if you try to
farm this place?

00:44:52.239 --> 00:44:54.590
Try to farm in a jungle,
what do you do?

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:56.119
Well you have to chop down the
trees, right?

00:44:56.119 --> 00:44:58.018
Now mind you,
I told you that the forest

00:44:58.018 --> 00:45:00.500
floor is moist and dark,
and if any of you have been

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.739
there, you'd know that it's very
striking.

00:45:02.739 --> 00:45:05.070
You're not boiling at all.
 

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:08.548
Now you cut down the trees;
the sun now beats down,

00:45:08.548 --> 00:45:11.882
the tropical sun can be quite
brutal and it dries out the

00:45:11.882 --> 00:45:13.489
soil, it bakes the soil.
 

00:45:13.489 --> 00:45:15.539
What dies?
 

00:45:15.539 --> 00:45:19.934
The fungi die because fungi
need coolish and moist

00:45:19.934 --> 00:45:21.190
environment.
 

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:25.190
They die, your means of
recycling nutrients is gone;

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:27.650
the soil has very little
nutrients itself.

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:31.949
What have you done with the
trees that you chopped down?

00:45:31.949 --> 00:45:35.094
If you're a commercial
agriculture place you ship them

00:45:35.094 --> 00:45:38.059
down river to a saw mill,
so the nutrients that are

00:45:38.059 --> 00:45:39.840
there, they're taken away.
 

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:42.210
The secret of what's called
Swidden agricultural,

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:46.161
slash and burn agriculture,
is that yes they do chop down

00:45:46.161 --> 00:45:49.875
the trees but in a very local,
very small plot of land,

00:45:49.875 --> 00:45:53.108
and they burn the trees in
place and that puts the ash as

00:45:53.108 --> 00:45:56.630
the mineral nutrients which are
so missing and that fertilizes

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:57.440
the soil.
 

00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:00.505
It's not wonderfully efficient
but it does work if you keep

00:46:00.505 --> 00:46:02.780
your plot small because then the
fungus,

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:06.731
which is killed there,
can reinvade from the

00:46:06.731 --> 00:46:08.570
surrounding trees.
 

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:12.382
You start doing commercial
farming with many,

00:46:12.382 --> 00:46:16.889
many acres of spread then
there's no way that soil is

00:46:16.889 --> 00:46:18.969
going to regenerate.
 

00:46:18.969 --> 00:46:22.050
How does this work out?
 

00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:26.197
For instance,
in the Yucatan of Mexico,

00:46:26.197 --> 00:46:31.000
the Maya lived there for a very
long time.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.974
In the sixteenth century,
a Franciscan bishop Diego de

00:46:34.974 --> 00:46:37.704
Landa,
who was--he wrote everything,

00:46:37.704 --> 00:46:41.673
everything we know about the
pre-colonial Mayan existence

00:46:41.673 --> 00:46:42.949
comes from him.
 

00:46:42.949 --> 00:46:45.193
The Yucatan,
this is from him,

00:46:45.193 --> 00:46:49.217
"The Yucatan is the
country with the least earth

00:46:49.217 --> 00:46:51.740
that I have seen,
since all of it is one living

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:52.806
rock,
and has wonderfully little

00:46:52.806 --> 00:46:53.239
earth."
 

00:46:53.239 --> 00:46:57.789
When you read all these
chronicles they always are--

00:46:57.789 --> 00:47:00.996
they're speaking always of
famines in the Yucatan because

00:47:00.996 --> 00:47:04.144
there's so little productivity
and how do they avoid the

00:47:04.144 --> 00:47:06.347
famines,
and this is again before the

00:47:06.347 --> 00:47:07.179
Spaniards came.
 

00:47:07.179 --> 00:47:12.079
They take care of their--they
have exports which they exchange

00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:14.570
for food from better regions.
 

00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:16.530
What do they export?
 

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:21.250
Honey; which you don't have to
farm, salt which you don't farm,

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:22.239
and slaves.
 

00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:25.197
That's another use for
"excess people"

00:47:25.197 --> 00:47:28.217
and controlling your
population, you sell them as

00:47:28.217 --> 00:47:28.909
slaves.
 

00:47:28.909 --> 00:47:32.626
You look all over the
pre-modern world and of course

00:47:32.626 --> 00:47:35.980
you know it's not gone in the
modern world,

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:40.757
slavery is a very big thing and
a very big part of what happens

00:47:40.757 --> 00:47:41.989
to population.
 

00:47:41.989 --> 00:47:43.639
We'll talk a little bit about
that later.

00:47:43.639 --> 00:47:49.159
Well let me say it now as long
as the topic came up.

00:47:49.159 --> 00:47:51.500
What is slavery a response too?
 

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:54.639
It's very relevant to this
lecture--under population.

00:47:54.639 --> 00:47:58.280
You don't have enough laborers
so you import slaves.

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.768
In the middle of Europe,
where you have teeming

00:48:00.768 --> 00:48:03.635
populations, or India,
or China, are you going to have

00:48:03.635 --> 00:48:05.150
an awful lot of slavery?
 

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:11.460
No, there's no land for them to
be utilized.

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:13.679
Slaves get used,
like in the Roman Empire,

00:48:13.679 --> 00:48:16.150
not as farmers;
there were hordes of Romans,

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:19.030
peasants that would love to
have some land to farm.

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:22.769
They're used in the mines;
there were household slaves,

00:48:22.769 --> 00:48:24.730
sex slaves, in the mines.
 

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:29.349
The Arab countries took a lot
of slaves through Madagascar and

00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:31.967
continental Africa;
household slaves,

00:48:31.967 --> 00:48:35.472
sex slaves, somewhat in the
mines but they didn't have that

00:48:35.472 --> 00:48:36.320
many mines.
 

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:39.860
Slavery is a response to under
population.

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:42.239
Where do you get huge slavery?
 

00:48:42.239 --> 00:48:46.442
When you discover the new world
and how you have this very thin

00:48:46.442 --> 00:48:48.949
Indian population in these
worlds,

00:48:48.949 --> 00:48:52.782
largely because we killed them
with diseases as you either have

00:48:52.782 --> 00:48:54.018
read or will read.
 

00:48:54.018 --> 00:48:57.949
You have an under
populated--two under populated

00:48:57.949 --> 00:49:01.210
huge continents with much good
land,

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:04.521
you first in Western--in
history first you try to enslave

00:49:04.521 --> 00:49:07.141
the Indians,
the Indians don't do very well,

00:49:07.141 --> 00:49:09.615
they die out,
so you stop that and you import

00:49:09.615 --> 00:49:11.780
African slaves who manage to
stay alive.

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:15.630
Slavery itself is a response to
under population.

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:18.389
It fits exactly into what I am
talking about.

00:49:18.389 --> 00:49:20.822
Wherever you see massive
slavery you're going to find

00:49:20.822 --> 00:49:23.998
under-population,
you're going to find areas of

00:49:23.998 --> 00:49:27.429
land that have nobody on them,
and someone can,

00:49:27.429 --> 00:49:33.909
by military force,
capture people and force them

00:49:33.909 --> 00:49:38.280
to work for themselves.
 

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:43.579
There's many other reasons why
the tropics are hard to farm.

00:49:43.579 --> 00:49:48.570
Where are the grain belts in
the world?

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:50.659
What do you know about--where
is grain grown?

00:49:50.659 --> 00:49:58.750
Where is the really rich places?
 

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:00.989
Anybody?
 

00:50:00.989 --> 00:50:01.730
Student:  US.
 

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:03.449
Prof: U.S.,
where in the U.S.?

00:50:03.449 --> 00:50:04.150
Student: Midwest.
 

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:06.192
Prof: Midwest,
upper Midwest,

00:50:06.192 --> 00:50:07.710
Iowa, Kansas,
Minnesota.

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:09.900
Does it go north of the U.S.?
 

00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:10.480
Student:  Yes.
 

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.309
Prof: Yes,
Saskatchewan,

00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:15.545
Alberta, way the heck up there,
you have this fabulous

00:50:15.545 --> 00:50:17.010
production of grain.
 

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:21.251
You see pictures of northern
Saskatchewan in Canada with the

00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:22.690
big grain reapers.
 

00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:26.710
China, where are the great
grain fields of China?

00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:35.719
Wheat--up in Manchuria,
goes up the northeast of China,

00:50:35.719 --> 00:50:37.907
is all grain,
all wheat, way up into

00:50:37.907 --> 00:50:40.824
Manchuria,
and Manchuria goes up it's more

00:50:40.824 --> 00:50:43.949
or less the same as Alberta and
Saskatchewan.

00:50:43.949 --> 00:50:48.204
In the south you don't get your
great grain growing regions in

00:50:48.204 --> 00:50:51.483
the tropical region,
certainly not in the desert

00:50:51.483 --> 00:50:52.320
regions.
 

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.273
You get them--Morocco,
for instance,

00:50:54.273 --> 00:50:57.731
has very productive agriculture
right on the coast where it's a

00:50:57.731 --> 00:50:58.570
wet region.
 

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:01.125
That's not very far north,
and down in South Africa,

00:51:01.125 --> 00:51:03.329
and Africa just doesn't go that
far south.

00:51:03.329 --> 00:51:06.579
In South America you get it
down in Argentina,

00:51:06.579 --> 00:51:10.039
so again--so there's something
that agriculture gets more

00:51:10.039 --> 00:51:12.449
productive the further north you
go,

00:51:12.449 --> 00:51:15.110
with a limit of course,
it doesn't go into the tropics.

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:15.980
Why should that be?
 

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:19.159
That goes contrary to our
expectation.

00:51:19.159 --> 00:51:23.179
Again, the reason is
biologically rather simple.

00:51:23.179 --> 00:51:26.469
During the daytime,
plants take in the sunlight and

00:51:26.469 --> 00:51:28.179
make sugar, make energy.
 

00:51:28.179 --> 00:51:32.581
They also respire,
they also have to run their own

00:51:32.581 --> 00:51:35.231
machinery,
so they're also using energy,

00:51:35.231 --> 00:51:39.831
using sugar all the time,
they use it day and they use it

00:51:39.831 --> 00:51:40.559
night.
 

00:51:40.559 --> 00:51:44.719
Now the sun goes down and
photosynthesis shuts down,

00:51:44.719 --> 00:51:47.382
but respiration continues,
they have to keep themselves

00:51:47.382 --> 00:51:50.938
alive at night just as we do,
we don't stop breathing when we

00:51:50.938 --> 00:51:51.768
go to sleep.
 

00:51:51.768 --> 00:51:55.385
The ratio between daylight and
nighttime, how many hours of

00:51:55.385 --> 00:51:58.692
daylight and how many of
nighttime is a very important

00:51:58.692 --> 00:52:00.750
factor in plant productivity.
 

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:05.771
In the tropics what's the ratio
of daylight to nighttime the

00:52:05.771 --> 00:52:07.389
whole year round?
 

00:52:07.389 --> 00:52:09.264
Student:  1:1
Prof: About 12/12,

00:52:09.264 --> 00:52:09.840
about equal.
 

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:12.929
What is it up in Saskatchewan
or Manchuria?

00:52:12.929 --> 00:52:15.590
Daylight, daylight,
daylight, very little

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:16.389
nighttime.
 

00:52:16.389 --> 00:52:19.411
The plants have so many more
hours in which they're

00:52:19.411 --> 00:52:22.675
photosynthesizing and much
smaller amount of time where

00:52:22.675 --> 00:52:25.940
they're not photosynthesizing
but still respiring.

00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:29.364
That's one big factor why you
get these grain belts going up

00:52:29.364 --> 00:52:29.829
north.
 

00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:33.583
Also temperature,
how much energy does it take

00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:36.420
you to just keep yourself alive?
 

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:38.710
Well we've just said,
all chemical reactions go--

00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:41.320
every ten degrees they more or
less double,

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:44.489
so respiration plants the
warmer they are,

00:52:44.489 --> 00:52:45.719
the more respiration they have.
 

00:52:45.719 --> 00:52:50.659
At nighttime it's still warm,
so everything is working rather

00:52:50.659 --> 00:52:52.469
fast in the tropics.
 

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:55.355
In Canada, it's a lot of sun
during the day,

00:52:55.355 --> 00:52:59.179
but it cools off at night,
and so respiration is at a very

00:52:59.179 --> 00:53:00.119
low level.
 

00:53:00.119 --> 00:53:03.804
The productivity of a plant is
the balance between its

00:53:03.804 --> 00:53:06.672
photosynthetic productions,
it's production,

00:53:06.672 --> 00:53:10.313
and its respiration,
use of that produce for its own

00:53:10.313 --> 00:53:11.139
purposes.
 

00:53:11.139 --> 00:53:15.661
There's a big difference in the
ratio in the north from Iowa to

00:53:15.661 --> 00:53:20.125
Saskatchewan,
or from the Yangtze up into

00:53:20.125 --> 00:53:25.684
Manchuria,
that ratio is just much better

00:53:25.684 --> 00:53:29.369
than it is in the tropics.
 

00:53:29.369 --> 00:53:34.760
We won't continue too much with
this.

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:37.159
We can also talk about the
diseases that--

00:53:37.159 --> 00:53:41.650
in tropical regions you get
Malaria,

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:45.809
you get a whole bunch of insect
borne diseases,

00:53:45.809 --> 00:53:50.840
tsetse flies carry sleeping
sickness, etc.

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:54.918
One to two million Africans die
of Malaria every year and that's

00:53:54.918 --> 00:53:56.989
about the same number as AIDS.
 

00:53:56.989 --> 00:54:01.028
Malaria and Aids are about
equally devastating to a

00:54:01.028 --> 00:54:02.079
population.
 

00:54:02.079 --> 00:54:07.025
It's about 11% to 22% of all
deaths in Africa are Malaria

00:54:07.025 --> 00:54:07.820
deaths.
 

00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:09.954
Yellow fever,
Leishmaniasis,

00:54:09.954 --> 00:54:13.590
bilharzia , roundworm,
hook worm, the number of

00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:18.255
parasites that live in tropical
regions is enormous and very

00:54:18.255 --> 00:54:21.340
often they kill humans and
make--

00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:25.440
they can't go in there to farm
because they'll die.

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:29.951
Why are the tropics so much
more susceptible to disease,

00:54:29.951 --> 00:54:33.806
this kind of disease,
insect born stuff than the

00:54:33.806 --> 00:54:35.530
northern regions?
 

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:40.860
It's a simple factor, winter.
 

00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:43.746
Winter kills insects,
it kills them massively,

00:54:43.746 --> 00:54:47.789
very hard for insects to not
freeze to death over the winter.

00:54:47.789 --> 00:54:51.349
Tropics don't have winter so
it's a whole class of problems;

00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:54.123
they dry out,
the winter is extremely dry,

00:54:54.123 --> 00:54:57.981
they go desiccate and freeze
and it's very--organisms kill

00:54:57.981 --> 00:54:58.590
them.
 

00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:01.244
In the tropics,
nice all the time,

00:55:01.244 --> 00:55:05.188
insects just have a good time
and they can evolve,

00:55:05.188 --> 00:55:10.420
use their evolution to attack
animals and people much better.

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:17.900
All of this really adds up and
geography counts and people have

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:21.280
to adapt to the geography.
 

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:24.494
In this case the adaptation is
to an under-population and I'm

00:55:24.494 --> 00:55:25.619
going to show you--
 

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:43.208
well just to give you an idea
of how densely populated Africa

00:55:43.208 --> 00:55:46.018
is or isn't,
here are some European--some

00:55:46.018 --> 00:55:47.159
non-African places.
 

00:55:47.159 --> 00:55:49.929
Netherlands is one of the most
crowded in the world;

00:55:49.929 --> 00:55:54.010
1,011 people per square mile.
 

00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:58.371
Japan: 870, but that's--in
terms of arable land Japan is

00:55:58.371 --> 00:55:59.880
mostly mountains.
 

00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:02.251
They just have very small areas
where people can land,

00:56:02.251 --> 00:56:04.132
so to compare the Netherlands
are all flat,

00:56:04.132 --> 00:56:05.518
people can live everywhere.
 

00:56:05.518 --> 00:56:08.211
But if you want to compare this
to that they're probably--per

00:56:08.211 --> 00:56:10.860
arable land where it's more
crowded than the Netherlands.

00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:14.945
Belgium same as here,
India, China and again China is

00:56:14.945 --> 00:56:17.668
the same thing,
they have the whole Himalaya

00:56:17.668 --> 00:56:20.791
Mountains in the west,
the whole huge dry regions in

00:56:20.791 --> 00:56:24.003
the north,
Tibet--Mongolia and the

00:56:24.003 --> 00:56:30.329
northwest regions so this is way
an underestimate for China.

00:56:30.329 --> 00:56:34.269
Mexico has a lot of desert,
looks fairly under populated,

00:56:34.269 --> 00:56:37.929
but a lot of that is because
you got desert space.

00:56:37.929 --> 00:56:42.367
Now you go to Africa,
Nigeria one of the most densely

00:56:42.367 --> 00:56:45.440
places is 346,
that's not extreme.

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:51.210
Since Nigeria it's all--no
mountains, no deserts.

00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:54.056
In principle all of this land
could be used so that's a real

00:56:54.056 --> 00:56:56.063
number,
whereas, the Chinese number you

00:56:56.063 --> 00:56:58.130
should multiply it by a factor
of three,

00:56:58.130 --> 00:57:00.518
it's about a third of the
Chinese land that's actually

00:57:00.518 --> 00:57:03.215
arable,
so China is ballpark 1,000 and

00:57:03.215 --> 00:57:05.760
Nigeria is about a third of
that.

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:09.302
Kenya is down--again Kenya is
pretty much all livable,

00:57:09.302 --> 00:57:11.510
and they have a low population.
 

00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:14.269
Madagascar's all livable.
 

00:57:14.269 --> 00:57:15.840
Angola is all livable.
 

00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.949
Mali and Niger have deserts so
those numbers have to be

00:57:18.949 --> 00:57:19.639
corrected.
 

00:57:19.639 --> 00:57:21.780
Congo doesn't have deserts.
 

00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:25.628
The point is that the
population density in Africa is

00:57:25.628 --> 00:57:29.329
a lot less than other places
that we think are--

00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:33.590
we don't think of Holland as
overpopulated,

00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:38.503
but in terms of just a simple
people per arable land it

00:57:38.503 --> 00:57:39.960
definitely is.
 

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:42.956
Africans, again,
we're looking at something that

00:57:42.956 --> 00:57:45.059
has a big historical component.
 

00:57:45.059 --> 00:57:47.630
I have to be careful when I'm
talking--what era of time I'm

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:48.340
talking about.
 

00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:51.695
These are modern numbers I'm
going to show you but they

00:57:51.695 --> 00:57:54.927
reflect people's attitudes that
have changed that are

00:57:54.927 --> 00:57:57.599
appropriate for some time in the
past,

00:57:57.599 --> 00:57:59.018
and only change very slowly.
 

00:57:59.018 --> 00:58:01.940
This is Morocco on the coast,
this is not part of the

00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:03.400
Sub-Saharan Africa zone.
 

00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:07.030
This is very integrated into
the Mediterranean zone.

00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:09.052
Almost everything you can say
about its culture,

00:58:09.052 --> 00:58:10.690
it's really a Mediterranean
culture.

00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:13.768
Look what's happened to its
fertility over time.

00:58:13.768 --> 00:58:15.164
It was very high,
more or less equal to every

00:58:15.164 --> 00:58:18.702
other place,
7.2 children per women and that

00:58:18.702 --> 00:58:22.813
stayed the same,
but in recent times it's gone

00:58:22.813 --> 00:58:25.789
down to less than half of that,
3.2.

00:58:25.789 --> 00:58:27.849
This is not the most recent
data.

00:58:27.849 --> 00:58:30.230
I wanted to show you a little
bit older data.

00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:32.280
It's gone down even further.
 

00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:36.949
That zone of North Africa,
Tunisia is at replacement

00:58:36.949 --> 00:58:40.246
fertility level,
and North Africa has

00:58:40.246 --> 00:58:42.719
characteristic of this.
 

00:58:42.719 --> 00:58:46.927
Now I'm going to show you the
next country to the south which

00:58:46.927 --> 00:58:47.630
is Mali.
 

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:50.974
I'm sorry Niger,
because Mali is also there,

00:58:50.974 --> 00:58:55.798
but Niger is--when you go south
you cross the Sahara Desert and

00:58:55.798 --> 00:58:58.599
you're in Sub-Sahara and Africa.
 

00:58:58.599 --> 00:59:02.014
Now look at its fertility,
this is even a little bit later

00:59:02.014 --> 00:59:04.351
in time, and look at its
fertility rate,

00:59:04.351 --> 00:59:06.030
it hasn't budged at all.
 

00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:08.983
It's again, eight--seven,
eight children,

00:59:08.983 --> 00:59:12.822
middle, eight children,
and it ends up here even more

00:59:12.822 --> 00:59:14.670
then it was in 1950s.
 

00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:17.420
It has not changed.
 

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:21.141
The fertility rate has not
responded to whatever it is

00:59:21.141 --> 00:59:25.072
about modern times and we'll
talk about it a lot what has

00:59:25.072 --> 00:59:27.320
caused fertility to go down.
 

00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:33.364
Now one thing you can say is
how many women don't want to

00:59:33.364 --> 00:59:38.007
have any more children,
and that, of course,

00:59:38.007 --> 00:59:43.190
depends on the number that you
already have.

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:46.030
It gets up too--it starts women
have no children,

00:59:46.030 --> 00:59:49.226
very few, most of them want
children, and they have one

00:59:49.226 --> 00:59:51.119
child that's enough for two.
 

00:59:51.119 --> 00:59:54.326
At two children already you
have like 40% of women already

00:59:54.326 --> 00:59:56.518
saying, two children's enough
for me;

00:59:56.518 --> 00:59:59.320
again this is Morocco in the
Mediterranean zone.

00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:02.023
Then when you get up to six
children almost everybody says

01:00:02.023 --> 01:00:02.449
enough.
 

01:00:02.449 --> 01:00:08.079
The average for the whole
country is--that's like 53.3%.

01:00:08.079 --> 01:00:13.666
More than half of the women
say, okay no more children,

01:00:13.666 --> 01:00:20.079
and again this data is seven
years old, it's even lower now.

01:00:20.079 --> 01:00:25.335
You compare this to Mali and
this is the number of women that

01:00:25.335 --> 01:00:30.208
don't want any more children,
and I think the final there is

01:00:30.208 --> 01:00:32.590
8.6 or something,
an enormous difference.

01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:34.849
That no matter how many
children they have even--

01:00:34.849 --> 01:00:38.780
this is eight--six and more
children,

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:42.057
still only a very few,
about a third of them say six

01:00:42.057 --> 01:00:46.130
or however many I have,
six and over is enough for me.

01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:58.699
This is in respect of those
two, you might say,

01:00:58.699 --> 01:01:04.509
well Niger is a very poor
country, Morocco is not anywhere

01:01:04.509 --> 01:01:07.760
near so poor,
it has something to do with

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.840
infant mortality.
 

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:12.889
This is indeed Morocco,
and look infant mortality has

01:01:12.889 --> 01:01:14.760
come down quite a bit.
 

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:19.364
It's getting there and so you
say, oh well that's why

01:01:19.364 --> 01:01:21.909
Morocco--
Moroccan's want and have fewer

01:01:21.909 --> 01:01:24.836
children because they have a
better situation with infant

01:01:24.836 --> 01:01:29.036
mortality,
but then you look at Niger and

01:01:29.036 --> 01:01:31.927
not--
it's not as good as Morocco but

01:01:31.927 --> 01:01:36.250
it's still come down quite a bit
and since then it's come down

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:37.030
further.
 

01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:41.766
You expect--well you'd see some
response in the fertility levels

01:01:41.766 --> 01:01:45.449
to that but you don't,
you don't see it at all.

01:01:45.449 --> 01:01:47.179
What's the difference?
 

01:01:47.179 --> 01:01:48.518
It's not religion.
 

01:01:48.518 --> 01:01:52.092
So both Niger and Morocco are
Sunni Muslim,

01:01:52.092 --> 01:01:56.601
and as far as I'm aware,
there's no big differences in

01:01:56.601 --> 01:02:00.090
the interpretation of religion
there.

01:02:00.090 --> 01:02:04.353
You see the same story in
Christian Sub-Saharan Africa

01:02:04.353 --> 01:02:05.320
countries.
 

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.947
This is Tanzania,
again about the same years,

01:02:08.947 --> 01:02:13.728
and basically no change in
fertility--a little drop in very

01:02:13.728 --> 01:02:15.130
recent times.
 

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:19.349
Zambia is coming up next,
in Zambia it's--even went

01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:24.496
higher and then it's down back
to where approximately where it

01:02:24.496 --> 01:02:25.510
started.
 

01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:26.579
This is characteristic.
 

01:02:26.579 --> 01:02:27.969
It's not a religious thing.
 

01:02:27.969 --> 01:02:31.659
There's something special about
Sub-Saharan Africa.

01:02:31.659 --> 01:02:35.489
Even South America doesn't look
like this at all.

01:02:35.489 --> 01:02:38.885
If you're in South America the
fertility is way,

01:02:38.885 --> 01:02:39.679
way down.
 

01:02:39.679 --> 01:02:43.952
There is something quite
special about Africa,

01:02:43.952 --> 01:02:49.650
and we're going to have to try
to figure out what that is.

01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:56.268
You'll read a really
interesting article by John

01:02:56.268 --> 01:03:04.860
Caldwell which talks about a
whole culture of reproduction.

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:08.820
Again, Africa is a huge place,
has many different cultures and

01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:11.420
we're just talking Sub-Saharan
Africa.

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.429
North Africa is a different
story;

01:03:13.429 --> 01:03:16.686
South Africa we have the
European settlement,

01:03:16.686 --> 01:03:21.202
that's another different story,
but the bulk of Central Africa

01:03:21.202 --> 01:03:23.349
to some degree fits this.
 

01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:26.597
You have places where you don't
have bad soil,

01:03:26.597 --> 01:03:30.639
so in the tropics Java has
volcanoes, volcanoes replenish

01:03:30.639 --> 01:03:31.289
soil.
 

01:03:31.289 --> 01:03:35.585
The mountain slopes of Kenya
have good soil from--again from

01:03:35.585 --> 01:03:36.750
volcanic soil.
 

01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:39.018
The stories there are a little
different.

01:03:39.018 --> 01:03:42.503
In general, we're talking about
those parts in Africa where it's

01:03:42.503 --> 01:03:46.202
hard to stay alive,
it's hard to get a population

01:03:46.202 --> 01:03:49.501
going that we're--
that places traditionally under

01:03:49.501 --> 01:03:52.250
populated and just now with
Western medicine are the

01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:55.268
population rates coming up to
where you might consider it

01:03:55.268 --> 01:03:55.969
crowded.
 

01:03:55.969 --> 01:03:59.989
A place like Nigeria now is
certainly crowded.

01:03:59.989 --> 01:04:08.675
In Africa, reproduction is at
the core of--the central core of

01:04:08.675 --> 01:04:11.809
traditional culture.
 

01:04:11.809 --> 01:04:15.835
Their religious ideas are all
tied in, very--essentially,

01:04:15.835 --> 01:04:19.717
with reproduction in the
lineage itself that means your

01:04:19.717 --> 01:04:21.300
line of ancestors.
 

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:25.083
The prime duty of a human,
in this cultural setting,

01:04:25.083 --> 01:04:29.090
is to reproduce the lineage,
keep the lineage going.

01:04:29.090 --> 01:04:32.610
This is not at all unique to
Africa.

01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:36.373
In Indonesia I saw there was an
awful lot of this going on and

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:38.780
I'll talk about other examples
of it.

01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:44.518
It's very pronounced in Africa
but not in any sense unique.

01:04:44.518 --> 01:04:47.639
The idea is that--one of the
ideas is that when a man dies he

01:04:47.639 --> 01:04:48.940
doesn't just disappear.
 

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:51.980
We have a nice funeral service
and say bye-bye,

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:55.300
and maybe once a year we come
and give flowers onto the grave,

01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:58.530
but we have no sense that that
person is still around.

01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:02.813
In these traditional parts of
the world the person lives on in

01:05:02.813 --> 01:05:06.465
kind of shadow world,
but he can communicate with his

01:05:06.465 --> 01:05:07.590
descendants.
 

01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:12.063
That's often not very
difficult, and he's dependent on

01:05:12.063 --> 01:05:14.849
his descendants for sustenance.
 

01:05:14.849 --> 01:05:17.992
If they don't feed him and give
him what he needs in the

01:05:17.992 --> 01:05:19.880
afterlife he is in big trouble.
 

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.724
If a man does not have
descendants then he really

01:05:22.724 --> 01:05:24.860
doesn't get anything when he
dies.

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:28.755
Again, I saw this in Bali
enormously, where there was

01:05:28.755 --> 01:05:32.800
enormous effort to bring
offerings to the recently dead

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.849
ancestors.
 

01:05:33.849 --> 01:05:35.579
They're very,
very sensible about it.

01:05:35.579 --> 01:05:38.809
You see in Bali the women
carrying these--

01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:40.630
they're beautiful in their
beautiful dress,

01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:43.228
and they have these huge
platters on their heads filled

01:05:43.228 --> 01:05:46.260
with the most delicious fruits
and arranged just gorgeously,

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:51.068
and they bring them to the
temple and the ancestors can

01:05:51.068 --> 01:05:53.751
partake of them,
and the next day they come and

01:05:53.751 --> 01:05:56.155
take it home and eat it,
because they understand that

01:05:56.155 --> 01:05:58.972
the ancestors are getting
spiritual not the physical

01:05:58.972 --> 01:05:59.469
stuff.
 

01:05:59.469 --> 01:06:02.989
So they leave it there and then
the ancestors can take what they

01:06:02.989 --> 01:06:04.737
get out of it,
and then the humans can take

01:06:04.737 --> 01:06:07.050
what they get out of it,
so it's not wasteful.

01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:10.530
Every store and every house
will have a little--every day a

01:06:10.530 --> 01:06:14.070
little thing out in the front
with a little bit of grain and

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:14.969
everything.
 

01:06:14.969 --> 01:06:16.070
The dogs come by and eat it.
 

01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:19.110
Of course the dogs come by and
eat it, but that's okay.

01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:24.675
The ancestors have taken,
and the spirits have taken what

01:06:24.675 --> 01:06:27.059
they want out of this.
 

01:06:27.059 --> 01:06:34.219
In temperate zones we associate
religion and our culture--

01:06:34.219 --> 01:06:37.157
big empires,
big states, the United States

01:06:37.157 --> 01:06:41.599
is huge and any western country
population is large compared to

01:06:41.599 --> 01:06:45.110
say a Balinese Village or an
African Village.

01:06:45.110 --> 01:06:46.550
Religion is big.
 

01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:49.614
How many billions of Christians
are there, how many billions of

01:06:49.614 --> 01:06:51.692
Muslims are there,
of Buddhists and Hindus,

01:06:51.692 --> 01:06:53.719
we got everything--everything
is big.

01:06:53.719 --> 01:06:57.657
In Africa, in a sense,
each family's ancestors are its

01:06:57.657 --> 01:07:01.371
gods, and both traditional and
political authority,

01:07:01.371 --> 01:07:04.789
and religion are very,
very local affairs.

01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:06.989
They're not agglomerated into
big things.

01:07:06.989 --> 01:07:11.614
No one expects the people in
this village to worship the same

01:07:11.614 --> 01:07:14.389
as the people in the next
village.

01:07:14.389 --> 01:07:18.525
There isn't so much the idea of
a central monotheistic type of

01:07:18.525 --> 01:07:22.050
god which is--that comes up when
you have empires.

01:07:22.050 --> 01:07:24.789
You have a central emperor and
you have a central god.

01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:27.505
When you don't--when your
political thing is just your

01:07:27.505 --> 01:07:30.032
village,
again traditional times,

01:07:30.032 --> 01:07:34.143
there's no concept,
no need to have these either

01:07:34.143 --> 01:07:39.018
central political leaders versus
central religious gods.

01:07:39.018 --> 01:07:43.590
Immortality for you is provided
by your descendants.

01:07:43.590 --> 01:07:46.500
Immortality is very local;
it's your own descendants.

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:50.304
That changes in Western
religion, especially in the

01:07:50.304 --> 01:07:52.969
Muslin Judeo-Christian
tradition.

01:07:52.969 --> 01:07:55.637
It's the religion,
it's God that gives you

01:07:55.637 --> 01:07:56.550
immortality.
 

01:07:56.550 --> 01:07:58.947
It's not your descendants,
so everybody's interested in

01:07:58.947 --> 01:08:01.293
immortality;
it's very important whether you

01:08:01.293 --> 01:08:03.239
go to heaven or hell and so
forth.

01:08:03.239 --> 01:08:06.893
The huge shift is whether it's
given to you by your

01:08:06.893 --> 01:08:09.251
descendants,
whether they take care of you

01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:10.860
and give you a kind of
immortality,

01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:13.880
or its given to you by your big
mega-religion,

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:18.908
which tells you what you have
to do in order to gain

01:08:18.908 --> 01:08:20.288
immortality.
 

01:08:20.288 --> 01:08:22.256
When a person dies,
there again,

01:08:22.256 --> 01:08:24.859
they don't go off to a distant
heaven,

01:08:24.859 --> 01:08:28.128
they stay right locally and
gradually after a few

01:08:28.128 --> 01:08:31.944
generations they kind of
disappear into the mist and they

01:08:31.944 --> 01:08:34.260
have a very careful departure.
 

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:37.349
Again, in Indonesia,
again comparing tropical

01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:41.773
regions, one of the big islands
is called Sulawesi or Celebes as

01:08:41.773 --> 01:08:44.020
we say in Western languages.
 

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.103
Again, in many different
cultures, but in some of them a

01:08:47.103 --> 01:08:50.579
person dies, you don't want to
disturb that person because they

01:08:50.579 --> 01:08:52.149
can do bad stuff to you.
 

01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:55.819
You swaddle them;
he's going to rot,

01:08:55.819 --> 01:08:58.011
so you got problems,
you give him swaddling clothes

01:08:58.011 --> 01:09:00.903
and you sit him in a chair,
him or her, in a chair right in

01:09:00.903 --> 01:09:03.639
his own bedroom,
right where they live in houses

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:05.564
sort of,
thatch houses,

01:09:05.564 --> 01:09:10.849
and they sit there for a long
time and gradually as they

01:09:10.849 --> 01:09:13.171
decay,
they smell, they take off the

01:09:13.171 --> 01:09:15.768
swaddling clothes,
get rid of that and swaddle

01:09:15.768 --> 01:09:18.408
them up again until they're down
to bones.

01:09:18.408 --> 01:09:20.220
And then they're taking up--so
they're not disturbed,

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:21.963
by that time they're ready,
they don't have their flesh

01:09:21.963 --> 01:09:23.471
anymore,
they're ready to leave,

01:09:23.471 --> 01:09:26.680
so they take them to these big
cliffs overlooking the village,

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:29.090
and there's caves,
natural caves in the cliff,

01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:31.210
and the dead bodies are brought
up there to sit,

01:09:31.210 --> 01:09:34.060
and look down over the village,
they're not very far away.

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:36.510
It's really quite wonderful.
 

01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:41.606
I was in Bali stumbling around
under funny circumstances in a

01:09:41.606 --> 01:09:45.260
cemetery, and all these graves
were open.

01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:47.943
I said, what's going on are
they expecting--have they dug an

01:09:47.943 --> 01:09:50.399
awful lot of graves expecting
everybody to die soon?

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:55.899
No, it turns out that a rich
man had just died.

01:09:55.899 --> 01:10:00.435
Now the poor people want to
provide for their ancestors in

01:10:00.435 --> 01:10:03.779
the next life but they don't
have money;

01:10:03.779 --> 01:10:07.167
they don't have any stuff,
so they bury him and they wait

01:10:07.167 --> 01:10:08.618
until a rich man dies.
 

01:10:08.618 --> 01:10:10.710
Then a rich man has this huge
procession.

01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:13.738
They're wonderful things to see
with big caskets,

01:10:13.738 --> 01:10:16.565
and big chariots,
and all this--just wonderful

01:10:16.565 --> 01:10:20.082
preparation and he's very rich
and the rich man's body is

01:10:20.082 --> 01:10:23.725
thrown into the ocean and all
kinds of stuff is thrown into

01:10:23.725 --> 01:10:27.368
the ocean to support this rich
man in his afterlife.

01:10:27.368 --> 01:10:29.762
Well, the poor people,
and it's quite okay because

01:10:29.762 --> 01:10:31.569
it's a very communal culture
Bali,

01:10:31.569 --> 01:10:34.810
very supportive of poor people,
they dig up their bodies,

01:10:34.810 --> 01:10:37.560
and they bring them in the same
time the rich man is put into

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:38.109
the ocean.
 

01:10:38.109 --> 01:10:39.350
Poor people are put into the
ocean.

01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:42.069
They partake of all of this.
 

01:10:42.069 --> 01:10:44.109
What happens the next day,
of course the ocean--

01:10:44.109 --> 01:10:47.537
all the coins and what not have
come up on the beach and the

01:10:47.537 --> 01:10:50.405
rag-pickers,
the really poor people come by

01:10:50.405 --> 01:10:52.270
and collect all this stuff.
 

01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:56.609
It has--this cultural act of
burying the rich,

01:10:56.609 --> 01:11:00.407
not only does it equalize the
afterlife of the rich people and

01:11:00.407 --> 01:11:03.085
the poor people,
but the very poorest people who

01:11:03.085 --> 01:11:06.027
are still alive get some income
out of it as well as of course

01:11:06.027 --> 01:11:07.859
everybody who prepares the
funeral.

01:11:07.859 --> 01:11:10.894
It's a wonderful sort of way
that everything sort of hangs

01:11:10.894 --> 01:11:13.130
together as they usually do in
cultures.

01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:17.829
We will continue next time.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:01.830
Prof: Okay.
 

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.110
Let us start,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.680
We're going to pursue the issue
of musical form today.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.967
It's an important thing to talk
about because it allows us to

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:12.050
follow a particular piece of
music,

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.274
and we'll be--I am using this
metaphor of a musical journey

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:20.571
and wanting to know where we are
in music throughout the day

00:00:20.571 --> 00:00:21.300
today.
 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.050
Form is particularly important
in all types of music--

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.400
popular music as well as
classical music--

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.230
and we have this complex of
material coming at us,

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.480
this sonic material.
 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.418
And we try to make sense of it,
and we say that it has a

00:00:37.418 --> 00:00:38.380
particular form.
 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.226
And we say it could have a
particular structure even,

00:00:41.226 --> 00:00:44.347
so we tend to use metaphors
having to do with architecture

00:00:44.347 --> 00:00:45.880
and things such as this.
 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.056
What we are really doing here
is taking all of this sonic

00:00:49.056 --> 00:00:52.630
information that's coming into
our brain and getting sorted,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.801
and makes us want to dance
around or clap or be sad or

00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:59.511
happy,
and make sense of it in terms

00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:03.119
of a few rather simple patterns.
 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.406
And musicians like to have
forms because oftentimes it

00:01:06.406 --> 00:01:10.251
tells them what they ought to do
next and where--here--I'm here

00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:12.360
but what ought to happen next?
 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.394
Well, if you've got a tried and
true musical form that other

00:01:15.394 --> 00:01:17.349
musicians have used over the
years,

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:20.614
you might be inclined to use it
too because your know your

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:22.790
listener will be able to follow
you.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.912
Now the other day,
I asked early on in the course

00:01:25.912 --> 00:01:30.012
about the form in popular music,
and I threw this out not really

00:01:30.012 --> 00:01:32.420
knowing what the answer would
be.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.013
What's the most common form
that one encounters when dealing

00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:37.050
with pop songs?
 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.569
And for the most part there was
silence across the room,

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.500
but one student--I have tracked
him down--

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.730
Frederick Evans,
gave a very good answer--

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.530
really a better answer than I
could have given.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.172
So, clearly Frederick knew
something about this idea of

00:01:54.172 --> 00:01:58.084
what he I think referred to as
"verse and chorus"

00:01:58.084 --> 00:01:59.030
structure.
 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.039
I might call it "strophe
and refrain,"

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.945
but it's the same thing whether
you have it in a Lied of Franz

00:02:05.945 --> 00:02:09.340
Schubert or in a piece that I
know nothing about.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.866
And Frederick is going to show
us--introduce us--to a piece

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.568
that I know nothing about.
 

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:17.048
I sent him an e-mail last night
saying, "Frederick,

00:02:17.048 --> 00:02:18.490
you gave a really good answer.
 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.592
Why don't you pick a piece,
come up and demonstrate

00:02:20.592 --> 00:02:21.139
this?"
 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:22.939
So this is Frederick Evans.
 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.229
We're going--or excuse me.
 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:25.008
Yeah, Frederick Evans.
 

00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:26.000
He's going to come up here.
 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.647
I'm told we have to give him a
microphone and he is going to

00:02:30.647 --> 00:02:33.800
introduce us to this particular
piece.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.800
Now you probably all know what
this piece is.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.419
How many of you have heard the
piece we were just listening to?

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:40.860
Everybody knows it.
 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.698
Who is the one person in the
room that's never heard this

00:02:43.698 --> 00:02:45.979
piece before--has no clue what's
happening?

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:47.440
Moi. Okay?
 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.035
So Frederick,
tell me about this piece,

00:02:50.035 --> 00:02:50.650
please.
 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.091
Frederick Evans:
All right.

00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:54.318
This is a piece by 'N
Sync--back when I was in fifth

00:02:54.318 --> 00:02:56.206
grade--
and it's "Bye Bye

00:02:56.206 --> 00:02:59.724
Bye," and the pattern that
it follows is really the

00:02:59.724 --> 00:03:02.218
archetype of a lot of popular
songs.

00:03:02.218 --> 00:03:06.384
It's half of the chorus or so
when it starts and then there's

00:03:06.384 --> 00:03:07.861
verse,
chorus, verse,

00:03:07.861 --> 00:03:10.360
chorus and then what I call the
bridge,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.610
which is like an emotional
climax.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.950
And then the last one is a
really powerful chorus where

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.378
they just bring it home and then
the music fades away.

00:03:17.378 --> 00:03:18.607
Prof: Okay.
 

00:03:18.607 --> 00:03:21.128
So it's this idea of changing
text,

00:03:21.128 --> 00:03:23.590
then coming back to familiar
text and familiar music,

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.365
then changing,
going back to the familiar new

00:03:26.365 --> 00:03:28.175
text,
and then coming back to the

00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:29.770
familiar in terms of the chorus.
 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.658
Is that a fair shake?
 

00:03:30.658 --> 00:03:31.198
Frederick Evans:
Yes, Sir.

00:03:31.198 --> 00:03:31.300
Yes.
 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.304
Prof: Okay.
 

00:03:32.304 --> 00:03:35.150
So shall we play--what are we
going to hear first?

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.227
Frederick Evans:
So first you'll hear from

00:03:37.227 --> 00:03:38.568
seconds twenty-four to forty.
 

00:03:38.568 --> 00:03:41.966
This is an example of the verse
where they have the beginning of

00:03:41.966 --> 00:03:44.770
the plot and then you have the
chorus at seconds--

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.348
about fifty-six--and that's
where you get your repeating

00:03:48.348 --> 00:03:50.414
idea,
which is what the piece is

00:03:50.414 --> 00:03:51.008
based on.
 

00:03:51.008 --> 00:03:53.955
And then last but not least,
you have the emotional buildup

00:03:53.955 --> 00:03:56.900
where the background and the
chord progression changes,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.626
a little more solemnly,
and then there's the last

00:03:58.626 --> 00:03:59.848
chorus that just brings it home.
 

00:03:59.848 --> 00:04:01.191
Prof: Okay.
 

00:04:01.191 --> 00:04:01.638
Great.
 

00:04:01.638 --> 00:04:03.650
Let's listen to the-yeah.
 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:20.370
&gt;
 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.110
Okay.
 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.913
Frederick Evans:
Yep.

00:04:23.913 --> 00:04:28.055
So that was the first verse and
that's when they really get you

00:04:28.055 --> 00:04:30.459
into what they're talking about.
 

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:55.269
&gt;
 

00:04:55.269 --> 00:04:57.456
Prof: What really
interests me here is what

00:04:57.456 --> 00:04:59.865
they're using is a baroque
ostinato "Lament

00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:02.937
bass" but that's--
we'll get on to that in another

00:05:02.937 --> 00:05:03.660
week or so.
 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.910
So that's--okay.
 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.040
Now we'll go to the bridge,
Frederick?

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.983
Frederick Evans:
Yes.

00:05:07.983 --> 00:05:09.939
There at the bridge is where
they really sum up all their

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:11.966
emotions and they really just
want to tell you what they're

00:05:11.966 --> 00:05:12.769
building towards.
 

00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:30.649
&gt;
 

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:32.105
Prof: Okay.
 

00:05:32.105 --> 00:05:33.560
That's wonderful.
 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.970
Thank you, Frederick.
 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.560
That's exactly what I wanted.
 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.430
&gt;
 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.860
&gt;
 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.117
Okay.
 

00:05:40.117 --> 00:05:43.161
How many want Craig to continue
teaching this course and how

00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:44.350
many want Frederick?
 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.310
Let's hear it for Craig.
 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.940
&gt;
 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.230
Let's hear it for Frederick.
 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.370
&gt;
 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.250
I knew it.
 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.757
Okay, but that's a good way of
getting introduced to the idea

00:05:54.757 --> 00:05:56.110
of musical form.
 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.329
Let's talk about form now in
classical music.

00:05:59.329 --> 00:06:02.115
The forms are a little more
difficult in classical music

00:06:02.115 --> 00:06:03.939
because the music is more
complex.

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:08.497
And before we launch into a
discussion of these musical

00:06:08.497 --> 00:06:13.562
forms, I want to talk about the
distinction of genre in music

00:06:13.562 --> 00:06:15.420
and form in music.
 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.401
So we're going to go over to
the board over here and you can

00:06:18.401 --> 00:06:21.079
see that I've listed the
standard classical genres.

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:22.810
What do we mean by genre in
music?

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.740
Well, simply musical type.
 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.949
So we've got this type called a
symphony and this type of music

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:30.540
called a string quartet and
concerto, and so on.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.656
We could add other types:
ballet, opera,

00:06:32.656 --> 00:06:33.850
things such as that.
 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.629
In the popular realm we've got
genres too.

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:39.540
We've got--classical New
Orleans jazz would be a genre.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.480
Blues would be a genre.
 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.600
Grunge rock would be another
sort of genre.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.447
A genre presupposes a
particular performing force,

00:06:49.447 --> 00:06:54.887
a particular length of pieces
and even dress and mode of

00:06:54.887 --> 00:06:59.240
behavior of the auditors--the
listeners.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.329
If we were going to listen to
the genre of a symphony,

00:07:02.329 --> 00:07:05.019
we would dress up one
particular way,

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:08.939
go to Woolsey Hall and expect
to be there from eight o'clock

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:10.269
until ten o'clock.
 

00:07:10.269 --> 00:07:13.831
If you were going to hear the
Rolling Stones play at

00:07:13.831 --> 00:07:17.535
Toad's--where they do play
occasionally--obviously one

00:07:17.535 --> 00:07:20.050
would not come at eight o'clock.
 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.464
One would come later,
and one would dress in a

00:07:22.464 --> 00:07:24.771
particular sort of way and one
would behave,

00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:27.079
presumably, in a different sort
of way.

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:30.192
So that's what we mean by
genre, a kind of general type of

00:07:30.192 --> 00:07:30.629
music.
 

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:34.230
Now today we'll start to talk
about form in music,

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.680
and what I need to say here is
that each of these genres is

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.932
made up of a--
of movements,

00:07:40.932 --> 00:07:45.649
and each of the movements is
informed by a particular form.

00:07:45.649 --> 00:07:49.071
So with the symphony we have
four movements there:

00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:51.701
fast,
slow, then either a minuet or a

00:07:51.701 --> 00:07:53.125
scherzo,
and a final,

00:07:53.125 --> 00:07:55.959
fast movement,
and each of these movements can

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:59.485
be in one of the number of
different forms and we'll talk

00:07:59.485 --> 00:08:02.129
about what they are in just a
moment.

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:05.911
So when we come to the string
quartet, same sort of thing:

00:08:05.911 --> 00:08:08.300
fast, slow, minuet,
scherzo, fast.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.829
Any one of those can be in a
particular form.

00:08:10.829 --> 00:08:13.100
Concerto, generally,
as mentioned before,

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.639
has just three movements and
sonata,

00:08:15.639 --> 00:08:18.379
a piano sonata,
something played on a piano,

00:08:18.379 --> 00:08:22.339
or a violin sonata with violin
and piano accompaniment--

00:08:22.339 --> 00:08:25.122
they generally have just three
movements: fast,

00:08:25.122 --> 00:08:25.910
slow, fast.
 

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.444
Okay.
 

00:08:26.444 --> 00:08:29.870
Let's talk about our forms now.
 

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.394
In classical music things go by
very quickly and it's difficult

00:08:34.394 --> 00:08:38.481
to kind of get a handle on it,
and we, generally in life,

00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:40.379
don't like to be lost.
 

00:08:40.379 --> 00:08:43.792
We like to know where we are,
we like to know what is

00:08:43.792 --> 00:08:47.139
happening, and this is what form
allows us to do.

00:08:47.139 --> 00:08:49.900
So that if we're hearing a
piece of music and all this

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.974
stuff is coming at us we want to
make sense of it by knowing

00:08:52.974 --> 00:08:54.590
approximately where we are.
 

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.460
Am I still toward the beginning?
 

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.658
Am I in the middle of this
thing?

00:08:57.658 --> 00:09:00.590
Am I getting anywhere near the
end of it?

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.080
How should I respond at this
particular point?

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.570
Well, if we have in mind what
I've identified here,

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:11.178
we will be referring to as our
six formal types,

00:09:11.178 --> 00:09:16.269
and we can think of these as
templates that,

00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:19.591
when we're hearing a piece of
music we make an educated

00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:22.418
decision about which formal type
is in play.

00:09:22.418 --> 00:09:27.028
And then we drop down the model
of this formal type,

00:09:27.028 --> 00:09:29.230
or the template of this formal
type,

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:33.559
and we sort of filter our
listening experience through

00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:36.408
this template,
or through this model.

00:09:36.408 --> 00:09:40.509
So here are our six models:
ternary form,

00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:44.714
sonata allegro form,
theme and variations,

00:09:44.714 --> 00:09:48.610
rondo, fugue,
and ostinato.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.750
And they developed at various
times in the history of music.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.100
Theme and variations is very
old.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.590
Sonata-allegro is a lot more
recent.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.753
Now of these,
the ones that we'll be working

00:10:00.753 --> 00:10:04.798
with today are ternary form and
sonata-allegro form,

00:10:04.798 --> 00:10:09.070
and sonata-allegro is the
hardest, the most complex,

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:10.879
the most difficult of all of
these forms.

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:16.659
It's so-called because it
usually shows up in the first

00:10:16.659 --> 00:10:20.687
movement of a sonata,
concerto, string quartet,

00:10:20.687 --> 00:10:22.982
symphony,
so--and the first movements are

00:10:22.982 --> 00:10:25.490
fast so that's why we have
allegro out there,

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:30.070
and it most is associated with
this idea of the sonata.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.769
It didn't necessarily originate
there.

00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:36.120
It originated there and in the
symphony,

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.878
but for historical reasons we
call this sonata because of its

00:10:40.878 --> 00:10:45.399
association with the sonata and
the fact that it goes--

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:49.298
and the fact that it goes
fast--sonata-allegro form.

00:10:49.298 --> 00:10:52.216
So that in a symphony,
usually your very first

00:10:52.216 --> 00:10:54.940
movement will be in
sonata-allegro form.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.547
Your slow movement,
well, that could be in theme

00:10:57.547 --> 00:11:00.409
and variations;
it could be in rondo;

00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:01.940
it could be in ternary form.
 

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.155
Your minuet and scherzo is
almost always in ternary form

00:11:06.155 --> 00:11:10.908
and your last fast movement
could be in sonata-allegro form.

00:11:10.908 --> 00:11:12.789
It could also be in theme and
variations;

00:11:12.789 --> 00:11:15.668
could be in rondo;
could be in fugue.

00:11:15.668 --> 00:11:18.129
Sometimes it's even in
ostinato form.

00:11:18.129 --> 00:11:22.341
So you can see that these forms
can show up and

00:11:22.341 --> 00:11:27.287
control--regulate--what happens
inside of each of these

00:11:27.287 --> 00:11:28.570
movements.
 

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.340
Okay?
 

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.879
Are there questions about that?
 

00:11:31.879 --> 00:11:34.210
Does that seem straightforward
enough?

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:38.961
We have a big picture of genre
here, movements within genre,

00:11:38.961 --> 00:11:42.664
and then forms informing each
of the movements.

00:11:42.664 --> 00:11:43.308
Yes.
 

00:11:43.308 --> 00:11:44.788
Student: Did you say
that the ternary form is

00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:45.950
normally used for the second
movement?

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:47.404
Prof: No.
 

00:11:47.404 --> 00:11:52.312
I said it's possible that it
is--could be--used for the

00:11:52.312 --> 00:11:54.038
second movement.
 

00:11:54.038 --> 00:11:58.240
A ternary form is one of the
forms that could be used with

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.230
the slow second movement.
 

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.940
We could also have theme and
variations.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.778
We're going to hear one of
those later in our course.

00:12:05.778 --> 00:12:08.928
It could also be a sort of slow
rondo.

00:12:08.928 --> 00:12:12.875
So it's just one of really
three possibilities there,

00:12:12.875 --> 00:12:15.230
but thanks for that question.
 

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.129
Anything else?
 

00:12:18.129 --> 00:12:18.613
Okay.
 

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:24.120
If not, let's talk then about
ternary form because ternary

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.854
form has much in common with
what we experience in

00:12:28.854 --> 00:12:31.269
sonata-allegro form.
 

00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:34.297
Let me take a very
straightforward example of

00:12:34.297 --> 00:12:35.330
ternary form.
 

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:39.484
It's from Beethoven's
"Für Elise,"

00:12:39.484 --> 00:12:42.618
the piece--
the piano piece that Beethoven

00:12:42.618 --> 00:12:46.299
wrote for one of his paramours
at one time or another.

00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:51.100
 
 

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:51.289
Here.
 

00:12:51.289 --> 00:12:52.889
I'm going to tell you a story
about this.

00:12:52.889 --> 00:12:54.808
My cell phone broke the other
day.

00:12:54.808 --> 00:13:00.250
My cell phone broke the other
day so I had to buy a new one.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.220
I was really happy about that.
 

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:08.690
I hated to lose my old Mozart
theme, but I then had to find a

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:10.740
new Mozart theme.
 

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.558
And nowadays my selections are
more limited.

00:13:14.558 --> 00:13:19.320
So when you go on to these
things--and in truth,

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.798
I actually had my youngest son
do this because I'm hopelessly

00:13:21.798 --> 00:13:23.408
incompetent with this kind of
thing--

00:13:23.408 --> 00:13:27.524
you go on to these things,
and now they only have one

00:13:27.524 --> 00:13:32.759
option for classical music,
one option for--but it's called

00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:35.990
"Mozart"
so good choice.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:40.195
Mozart has become the icon of
classical music and I think it's

00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:44.399
the individual that should be
the icon for classical music.

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:47.613
All classical music now has
been reduced down to just

00:13:47.613 --> 00:13:48.169
Mozart.
 

00:13:48.169 --> 00:13:49.918
Okay.
 

00:13:49.918 --> 00:13:52.413
I have no idea what that was
about, but, well,

00:13:52.413 --> 00:13:53.298
who's calling?
 

00:13:53.298 --> 00:13:54.042
All right.
 

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:57.980
So we have this piece in
ternary form by Beethoven,

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.221
and ternary form is--conveys to
us simply the idea of

00:14:01.221 --> 00:14:05.791
presentation,
diversion, re-presentation or

00:14:05.791 --> 00:14:08.195
statement,
digression,

00:14:08.195 --> 00:14:10.970
restatement--anything like this.
 

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.980
We like to diagram these in
terms of alphabetical letters.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.149
You can think just A, B, A.
 

00:14:16.149 --> 00:14:33.350
&gt;
 

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.823
All right.
 

00:14:33.823 --> 00:14:35.009
I'm going to pause here.
 

00:14:35.009 --> 00:14:36.350
We started out here.
 

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.639
&gt;
 

00:14:37.639 --> 00:14:39.590
We are in this key.
 

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:40.470
Major or minor?
 

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:41.679
What do you think?
 

00:14:41.679 --> 00:14:43.639
Minor. All right.
 

00:14:43.639 --> 00:14:45.759
So were coming to the end of
this A section.

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:53.798
Here--The A section is very
short &lt;&lt;plays

00:14:53.798 --> 00:14:56.418
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:14:56.418 --> 00:15:00.250
but then &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.139
we--major or minor?
 

00:15:02.139 --> 00:15:03.038
Major. Right.
 

00:15:03.038 --> 00:15:03.875
&gt;
 

00:15:03.875 --> 00:15:04.620
So what happened there?
 

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.980
What do we call this?
 

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.340
&gt;
 

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.320
It's a very quick modulation.
 

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.230
We've changed keys.
 

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:17.067
And I'm going to digress here
just for a moment to talk about

00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:20.778
this, which is this concept of
relative major and minor.

00:15:20.778 --> 00:15:24.033
You may have noticed in
music--and it's discussed

00:15:24.033 --> 00:15:27.625
briefly in the textbook--that
there are pairs of keys,

00:15:27.625 --> 00:15:30.879
pairs of keys that have
something in common.

00:15:30.879 --> 00:15:34.879
The members of the pairs have
the same key signature,

00:15:34.879 --> 00:15:36.580
and we could take any key
signature--

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.288
three flats or two sharps,
whatever--

00:15:39.288 --> 00:15:43.139
but there's going to be one
major key with three flats and

00:15:43.139 --> 00:15:45.370
one minor key with three flats.
 

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:49.418
And I think we have up on the
board here an example of just

00:15:49.418 --> 00:15:53.259
that so you can see written in
here the three flats,

00:15:53.259 --> 00:15:57.250
and this is a minor scale with
three flats.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.775
Now we could also have three
flats over here,

00:15:59.775 --> 00:16:03.278
but we encounter three flats
where we have the major scale.

00:16:03.278 --> 00:16:07.230
This happens to work out so
that it's pitched on C.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.158
If we come up three half steps
in the keyboard,

00:16:10.158 --> 00:16:14.080
we come up to E-flat so the
relative major--

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:18.220
the major key in this pair--is
always three half steps--

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.692
&gt;
 

00:16:20.692 --> 00:16:26.278
one, two, three--three half
steps up above its paired minor.

00:16:26.278 --> 00:16:29.306
Here's another one down at the
bottom--happens to have one

00:16:29.306 --> 00:16:30.048
sharp in it.
 

00:16:30.048 --> 00:16:33.405
We have the key of G major here
with one sharp but if we come

00:16:33.405 --> 00:16:36.259
down three half steps
&gt;

00:16:36.259 --> 00:16:40.455
we get its relative minor down
here, and the reason I mentioned

00:16:40.455 --> 00:16:44.110
this is not because we actually
hear this very much.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:47.270
I'm not sure that I hear
modulations to relative major

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:50.850
because I don't have absolute
pitch and I'm not tracking keys

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.772
when I listen to pieces--
and my guess is you're not

00:16:53.772 --> 00:16:54.139
either.
 

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:57.335
So for the average listener,
we may not hear the actual

00:16:57.335 --> 00:17:00.945
pitch relationship but we may
hear that we've had a modulation

00:17:00.945 --> 00:17:03.429
and you can kind of make an
educated guess:

00:17:03.429 --> 00:17:06.862
that about fifty percent of the
time if it's going minor to

00:17:06.862 --> 00:17:09.028
major,
it's coming in this relative

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:10.890
arrangement--
where major down to minor;

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:14.237
it's going in this relative
arrangement, so this happens a

00:17:14.237 --> 00:17:14.588
lot.
 

00:17:14.588 --> 00:17:19.959
So here we are in the mid
section of our ternary form,

00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:20.769
A B A.
 

00:17:20.769 --> 00:17:29.828
Here's the B part &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:17:29.828 --> 00:17:32.240
and then back to &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.910
the minor A.
 

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:41.140
&gt;
 

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.910
Now that's just the opening
section of this piece.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:49.222
It goes on to do other things,
but it's a very succinct

00:17:49.222 --> 00:17:54.348
example of ternary form,
and ternary form is a useful

00:17:54.348 --> 00:17:57.700
way of introducing a larger
concept,

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.558
which is sonata-allegro form.
 

00:18:00.558 --> 00:18:09.284
So let me flip the board here,
and here we go on to this

00:18:09.284 --> 00:18:13.250
rather complex diagram.
 

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:17.327
As I say, it's the most complex
one of all the six forms that

00:18:17.327 --> 00:18:18.960
we'll be working with.
 

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.041
It consists of three essential
parts: exposition,

00:18:23.041 --> 00:18:25.848
development and recapitulation.
 

00:18:25.848 --> 00:18:28.118
So you could think you were
coming out of ternary form.

00:18:28.118 --> 00:18:31.220
You've got an A here,
you've got a B idea here and

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.017
then you've got an A return back
here--but this is a lot more

00:18:35.017 --> 00:18:36.029
complicated.
 

00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:37.740
There are things--lots of
things--going on.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:42.601
And I should say also--in terms
of fairness in advertising--that

00:18:42.601 --> 00:18:43.990
this is a model.
 

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:48.088
This is also something of an
abstraction or an ideal.

00:18:48.088 --> 00:18:52.643
Not every piece written in
sonata-allegro form conforms to

00:18:52.643 --> 00:18:55.358
this diagram in all particulars.
 

00:18:55.358 --> 00:18:58.605
Composers wouldn't want to do
that--they'd have to assert

00:18:58.605 --> 00:19:01.270
their independence or
originality in one way or

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.880
another--but it's a useful sort
of model.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.568
It tells us what the norm is,
what we can generally expect.

00:19:07.568 --> 00:19:12.074
So we've got these three sort
of sine qua non here and

00:19:12.074 --> 00:19:16.278
then we've got two optional
parts of this that we'll talk

00:19:16.278 --> 00:19:18.078
about as we proceed.
 

00:19:18.078 --> 00:19:22.596
So this is the way we set out
then sonata-allegro form:

00:19:22.596 --> 00:19:26.108
exposition, development,
recapitulation.

00:19:26.108 --> 00:19:30.288
So we start out with the first
theme, in the tonic key of

00:19:30.288 --> 00:19:30.960
course.
 

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.765
It might even have subsets to
it so that we could have one A

00:19:34.765 --> 00:19:36.700
and one B and one C up here.
 

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.750
I won't put them up there but
it can happen.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:44.009
Then we have a transition in
which we have a change of key,

00:19:44.009 --> 00:19:46.640
moving to the dominant key.
 

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.630
Transitions tend to be rather
unsettled.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.022
It gives you the sense of
moving somewhere,

00:19:52.022 --> 00:19:53.048
going somewhere.
 

00:19:53.048 --> 00:19:54.618
That's why it's called a
transition.

00:19:54.618 --> 00:19:58.009
It could also--musicians
like--quickly--like to call it a

00:19:58.009 --> 00:19:59.279
"bridge."
 

00:19:59.279 --> 00:20:02.537
It's sort of leading you
somewhere else--and maybe in

00:20:02.537 --> 00:20:06.170
that way it is similar to the
type of bridge that Frederick

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:08.048
was talking about earlier.
 

00:20:08.048 --> 00:20:11.708
So we have a transition or
bridge that takes us to a second

00:20:11.708 --> 00:20:13.980
theme in--now in the dominant
key.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.705
If, however,
our symphony happened to begin

00:20:17.705 --> 00:20:21.432
in a minor key,
then the second theme would

00:20:21.432 --> 00:20:24.450
come in in the relative major.
 

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:28.587
So if we had C minor as
Beethoven does in his Fifth

00:20:28.587 --> 00:20:31.900
Symphony-- &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:37.316
So there we are there in C
minor, but the second theme

00:20:37.316 --> 00:20:40.279
&gt;
 

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:44.059
is in the relative major of
E-flat.

00:20:44.059 --> 00:20:45.970
Both have three flats in it.
 

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:49.005
So if you have the start in
minor, then composers

00:20:49.005 --> 00:20:51.700
traditionally modulate,
not to the dominant,

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.692
but to the relative major--
which is up on the third degree

00:20:54.692 --> 00:20:55.380
of the scale.
 

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.259
That's why there's a big three
(III) there.

00:20:57.259 --> 00:20:59.140
So then the second theme comes
in.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.920
It's usually contrasting,
lyrical, sweeter.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.296
You heard the difference
there--more song-like in the

00:21:05.296 --> 00:21:07.500
Beethoven--
not so much of that musical

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.769
punch in the nose as I like to
refer to it,

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:14.900
but a more relaxed sort of
second theme,

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.394
and there is oftentimes some
filler or what we might call an

00:21:18.394 --> 00:21:21.000
interstice and we come to a
closing theme.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.787
That's abbreviated up here,
just CT, closing theme of the

00:21:23.787 --> 00:21:25.578
exposition, closes the
exposition.

00:21:25.578 --> 00:21:29.441
Closing themes tend to be
rather simple in which they rock

00:21:29.441 --> 00:21:33.641
back and forth between dominant
and tonic so that you could end

00:21:33.641 --> 00:21:37.637
on the tonic and that gives you
a sense of conclusion of the

00:21:37.637 --> 00:21:38.789
exposition.
 

00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:40.259
Now what happens?
 

00:21:40.259 --> 00:21:42.420
Well, you see these dots up on
the board.

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.798
Anybody know what these dots
mean?

00:21:43.798 --> 00:21:48.659
I think we--actually we talk
about this if you read ahead in

00:21:48.659 --> 00:21:53.930
the textbook Can somebody tell
me what the dots mean*&gt;* Jerry?

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:54.819
Student: Repeat?
 

00:21:54.819 --> 00:21:56.470
Prof: Okay. Repeat. Okay.
 

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:58.920
So that's what dots in music
do-- when we have these double

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.455
bars and dots that means repeat
so we got to repeat the whole

00:22:01.455 --> 00:22:02.088
exposition.
 

00:22:02.088 --> 00:22:05.961
If we didn't like it the first
time, we get a second pass at it

00:22:05.961 --> 00:22:06.960
in the repeat.
 

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.167
Then we go on to the
development and as the term

00:22:09.167 --> 00:22:10.858
"development"
suggests,

00:22:10.858 --> 00:22:13.460
we're going to develop the
theme here,

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.598
but it is oftentimes more than
that.

00:22:15.598 --> 00:22:18.034
It could be something other
than just the development and

00:22:18.034 --> 00:22:18.730
the expansion.
 

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:19.910
It could actually be a
contraction.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:24.102
Beethoven likes to strip away
things and sort of play with

00:22:24.102 --> 00:22:28.588
particular subsets of themes or
play with parts of motives.

00:22:28.588 --> 00:22:31.721
Generally speaking,
your development is

00:22:31.721 --> 00:22:36.420
characterized by tonal
instability--moves around a lot.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:40.442
You can't tell what key you're
in--tonal instability--and it

00:22:40.442 --> 00:22:42.963
also tends to be,
in terms of texture,

00:22:42.963 --> 00:22:46.509
the most polyphonic of any
section in the piece.

00:22:46.509 --> 00:22:49.273
There's a lot of counterpoint
usually to be found in the

00:22:49.273 --> 00:22:50.380
development section.
 

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:54.500
Then towards the end of the
development section we want to

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:59.055
get back here to the return and
we want to get back to our first

00:22:59.055 --> 00:23:01.078
theme and our tonic key.
 

00:23:01.078 --> 00:23:06.358
So composers oftentimes will
sit on one chord.

00:23:06.358 --> 00:23:09.930
What they will sit on will
happen to be the dominant.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.940
So I could put that up here.
 

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:17.038
We could put a five (V) up here
because we want a long period of

00:23:17.038 --> 00:23:18.900
dominant preparation.
 

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.720
&gt;
 

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.828
is where we're going,
back over here.

00:23:24.828 --> 00:23:28.402
But we're going to set this up
as preparation in terms of the

00:23:28.402 --> 00:23:31.318
dominant that wants to push us
in to the tonic.

00:23:31.318 --> 00:23:34.536
So there we are back in the
tonic now and all the first

00:23:34.536 --> 00:23:36.798
themes come back as they did
before.

00:23:36.798 --> 00:23:40.950
We also have a bridge but this
time it does not modulate.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.410
It stays in the tonic key.
 

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:46.077
We don't want it to modulate
because we've got to finish in

00:23:46.077 --> 00:23:46.858
the tonic here.
 

00:23:46.858 --> 00:23:49.378
So I was thinking just a moment
ago it's kind of the

00:23:49.378 --> 00:23:50.960
"bridge to nowhere."
 

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.558
It really is a bridge to
nowhere.

00:23:52.558 --> 00:23:55.380
You go right back to where you
were.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.990
You stay in that tonic key and
the second theme material comes

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:02.126
in, your closing theme comes in,
and you could end the

00:24:02.126 --> 00:24:03.368
composition here.
 

00:24:03.368 --> 00:24:07.646
Sometimes Mozart as we will see
in our course will end a piece

00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:12.165
right at this point--
the end, right there--but more

00:24:12.165 --> 00:24:16.720
often than not composers will
throw on a coda.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.680
What's a coda do?
 

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.291
Well, it really says to the
listener that "hey,

00:24:21.291 --> 00:24:24.410
the piece is sort of at an end
here."

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:28.558
Codas generally are very static
harmonically.

00:24:28.558 --> 00:24:30.500
They're--there's not a lot of
movement.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.336
It's--and I keep--maybe I
should have got-- come up a

00:24:33.336 --> 00:24:36.828
different metaphor here--the
idea of throwing an anchor over,

00:24:36.828 --> 00:24:40.489
slowing the whole thing down,
simplifying it to say we're at

00:24:40.489 --> 00:24:41.108
the end.
 

00:24:41.108 --> 00:24:47.660
So you get a lot of the
&gt;

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:51.286
kind of things in the coda just
to tell the listener it's time

00:24:51.286 --> 00:24:54.733
to think about clapping at this
point, or reaching for your

00:24:54.733 --> 00:24:55.269
coat.
 

00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:57.442
And the other
optional--Coda--What's that come

00:24:57.442 --> 00:24:57.779
from?
 

00:24:57.779 --> 00:25:02.500
The Latin cauda (caudae)
I guess.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.954
Italian coda means tail,
and these can be,

00:25:05.954 --> 00:25:08.259
like all tails,
long or short.

00:25:08.259 --> 00:25:10.200
Mozart happened to like short
codas.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.920
Beethoven liked longer codas.
 

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.537
And the other optional
component here is the

00:25:15.537 --> 00:25:16.450
introduction.
 

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.368
My guess is--Jacob,
what would you guess?

00:25:18.368 --> 00:25:21.680
How many--what portion of
classical symphonies--

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.814
you're an orchestral
player--what portion of

00:25:23.814 --> 00:25:26.445
classical symphonies would begin
with an introduction,

00:25:26.445 --> 00:25:27.339
would you say?
 

00:25:27.339 --> 00:25:29.279
Student: Most of them.
 

00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:31.410
Prof: Most of them?
 

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.608
Well, we'll consider that.
 

00:25:34.608 --> 00:25:37.180
Let's go for fifty percent at
the moment.

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:41.710
We'll consider fifty percent at
the moment, so we'll see.

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:48.406
Now let's jump into a classical
composition that begins with a

00:25:48.406 --> 00:25:52.140
movement in sonata-allegro form.
 

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:55.287
We're going to open here with
Mozart's "Eine kleine

00:25:55.287 --> 00:25:57.404
Nachtmusik,"
"A Little Night

00:25:57.404 --> 00:25:58.318
Music."
 

00:25:58.318 --> 00:26:06.230
This is sort of serenade stuff
that he wrote for Vienna--sort

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:10.450
of night music,
evening music.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:12.058
Let's listen to a little of it.
 

00:26:12.058 --> 00:26:15.345
We're going to start with the
first theme idea,

00:26:15.345 --> 00:26:17.915
and before she does let me play
this.

00:26:17.915 --> 00:26:20.130
&gt;
 

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.819
What about that?
 

00:26:21.819 --> 00:26:23.220
Conjunct or disjunct melody?
 

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.660
Students: Disjunct.
 

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:25.672
Prof: Disjunct,
yeah.

00:26:25.672 --> 00:26:27.960
There's a lot of jumping around
&gt;

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:28.910
and that kind of thing.
 

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:30.038
Notice it's mostly
&gt;

00:26:30.038 --> 00:26:33.134
just a major triad with
&gt;

00:26:33.134 --> 00:26:33.940
underneath.
 

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:37.336
So if we were at a concert and
we wanted to remember this,

00:26:37.336 --> 00:26:40.019
we'd probably have a lot of
skippy Xs here.

00:26:40.019 --> 00:26:42.078
We don't have time to get into
the particulars of this,

00:26:42.078 --> 00:26:44.328
but that's why we're doing all
of this diagramming stuff.

00:26:44.328 --> 00:26:46.450
So we got a lot of these
skipping Xs.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:46.990
All right.
 

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:50.026
So let's listen to the first
theme of Mozart's "Eine

00:26:50.026 --> 00:26:51.490
kleine Nachtmusik."
 

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:58.940
&gt;
 

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:10.519
A little syncopation there.
 

00:27:10.519 --> 00:27:14.593
And a sort of a counterpoint to
this, so maybe we've got a

00:27:14.593 --> 00:27:17.809
couple of little ideas in here:
A, B and C.

00:27:17.809 --> 00:27:22.559
&gt;
 

00:27:22.559 --> 00:27:26.150
Ah, agitation, movement.
 

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:32.119
&gt;
 

00:27:32.119 --> 00:27:35.069
Here goes the bass.
 

00:27:35.069 --> 00:27:37.868
&gt;
 

00:27:37.868 --> 00:27:38.329
Pause.
 

00:27:38.329 --> 00:27:42.170
So we had a cadence there,
&gt;.

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:44.002
That would be the end of the
musical phrase,

00:27:44.002 --> 00:27:45.880
a cadence, and the music
actually stopped.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:49.068
I used to like to think of this
in terms of almost a drama.

00:27:49.068 --> 00:27:51.719
We've got a change of scene
here the--where some characters

00:27:51.719 --> 00:27:53.409
have gone off,
the stage is now clear,

00:27:53.409 --> 00:27:55.509
and other characters are going
to come on.

00:27:55.509 --> 00:27:57.308
So what characters are going to
come on?

00:27:57.308 --> 00:28:00.088
Well, a more lyrical second
theme.

00:28:00.088 --> 00:28:01.789
I'm going to play just a bit of
it for you.

00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:07.828
&gt;
 

00:28:07.828 --> 00:28:08.641
What about this?
 

00:28:08.641 --> 00:28:09.959
Is this a conjunct melody?
 

00:28:09.959 --> 00:28:11.430
Obviously, it's descending.
 

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:12.640
Conjunct or disjunct?
 

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.490
&gt;
 

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:15.900
Very conjunct.
 

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.380
Actually, it's just running
down the scale.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.929
Now we don't have time,
because this music is going by

00:28:19.929 --> 00:28:20.410
so fast.
 

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:23.858
We've got our skippy opening
theme going around like that.

00:28:23.858 --> 00:28:27.709
We don't have time to sort of
write down all those Xs so maybe

00:28:27.709 --> 00:28:28.528
just--yeah.
 

00:28:28.528 --> 00:28:29.846
&gt;
 

00:28:29.846 --> 00:28:32.478
And maybe something--
&gt;

00:28:32.478 --> 00:28:33.920
something like that.
 

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.808
So this is our first skippy
theme.

00:28:35.808 --> 00:28:37.868
Our second theme
&gt;

00:28:37.868 --> 00:28:39.650
has a nice sort of fall to it.
 

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:41.210
Okay. Here's the second theme.
 

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:44.539
&gt;
 

00:28:44.539 --> 00:28:45.619
Repeat.
 

00:28:45.619 --> 00:28:55.339
&gt;
 

00:28:55.339 --> 00:28:57.779
Now closing theme already.
 

00:28:57.779 --> 00:29:17.598
&gt;
 

00:29:17.598 --> 00:29:21.119
What's the most noteworthy
aspect of that theme?

00:29:21.119 --> 00:29:24.630
&gt;
 

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:25.838
What do you think?
 

00:29:25.838 --> 00:29:28.329
Thoughts--what would you
remember about that?

00:29:28.329 --> 00:29:30.230
How would you graph that?
 

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:32.269
Yeah.
 

00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:33.058
Student:
&gt;

00:29:33.058 --> 00:29:34.002
Prof: Okay.
 

00:29:34.002 --> 00:29:34.265
Yeah.
 

00:29:34.265 --> 00:29:36.519
It starts out &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:29:36.519 --> 00:29:38.980
and then it's really conjunct,
right,

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.598
because it's staying on one
pitch level,

00:29:41.598 --> 00:29:46.178
sort of the ultimate conjunct
joined to the point that it's a

00:29:46.178 --> 00:29:48.769
unison pitch,
&gt;.

00:29:48.769 --> 00:29:51.588
So I'd remember that just like
this idea.

00:29:51.588 --> 00:29:54.210
So our closing theme,
&gt;

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:56.330
almost is the
"woodpecker"

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:56.634
idea.
 

00:29:56.634 --> 00:29:57.180
Sorry.
 

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.318
But think of that kind of
&gt;

00:29:59.318 --> 00:30:02.708
or maybe even a machine
gun--whatever sort of silly

00:30:02.708 --> 00:30:06.640
analogy you want to construct to
help you remember that.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.124
Okay.
 

00:30:07.124 --> 00:30:12.160
So here we are almost at the
end of the exposition.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.519
Let's listen now to the end of
exposition and then we'll stop.

00:30:15.519 --> 00:30:31.818
&gt;
 

00:30:31.818 --> 00:30:32.295
Okay.
 

00:30:32.295 --> 00:30:35.150
So we're going to stop there.
 

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:37.788
Now on this recording what do
you think?

00:30:37.788 --> 00:30:42.433
Well, I think--reasons for
time--let's go ahead and we'll

00:30:42.433 --> 00:30:47.410
advance it up to the beginning
of the development section.

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:50.700
So now we should listen to this
whole complex once again,

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.640
but we're not going to do that.
 

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.365
We're going to proceed here and
we're going to go in to the

00:30:55.365 --> 00:30:56.400
development section.
 

00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.247
And it's kind of fun the way
Mozart starts the development

00:31:00.247 --> 00:31:01.259
section here.
 

00:31:01.259 --> 00:31:04.089
&gt;
 

00:31:04.089 --> 00:31:05.309
Let me ask you this.
 

00:31:05.309 --> 00:31:06.140
We started here.
 

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.838
&gt;
 

00:31:08.838 --> 00:31:12.039
The development begins higher
or lower?

00:31:12.039 --> 00:31:14.759
&gt;
 

00:31:14.759 --> 00:31:15.950
Yeah?
 

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:16.598
Student: Lower.
 

00:31:16.598 --> 00:31:19.278
Prof: Lower so he's
dropped down to the dominant.

00:31:19.278 --> 00:31:23.200
He's now in the dominant
&gt;

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:28.140
and if he continued as he had,
&gt;

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.548
that's what he would have done.
 

00:31:29.548 --> 00:31:30.450
That's not what he does,
however.

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:38.318
&gt;
 

00:31:38.318 --> 00:31:46.000
He's sitting here &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.259
and he ends up there
&gt;

00:31:47.259 --> 00:31:49.028
so we get this sort of
dissonant shift,

00:31:49.028 --> 00:31:49.960
and it's a signal.
 

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.869
It's like the composer holding
up a sign:

00:31:51.869 --> 00:31:54.450
"development---time for the
development now!"

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:54.880
Okay?
 

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:58.909
So something--we've shifted,
we--or a sort of slap in the

00:31:58.909 --> 00:32:03.009
face telling us that we're at a
new point in our form,

00:32:03.009 --> 00:32:05.509
a new section in our form,
the development section.

00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:08.440
So as we listen to this we'll
hear Mozart move quickly through

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.930
some--lots of different keys.
 

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:12.700
I wouldn't be able to tell you
what keys they are.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:13.568
I really wouldn't.
 

00:32:13.568 --> 00:32:16.278
But I do know that he moves
through different keys.

00:32:16.278 --> 00:32:18.288
Then we will hear a
re-transition start,

00:32:18.288 --> 00:32:21.481
but here is my challenge to you
and why I'm sort of putting all

00:32:21.481 --> 00:32:22.769
these things up here.
 

00:32:22.769 --> 00:32:25.890
Which theme does he choose to
develop here?

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:26.838
Kind of interesting.
 

00:32:26.838 --> 00:32:30.971
Does he go with the first
theme, &gt;

00:32:30.971 --> 00:32:33.154
or the &gt;
 

00:32:33.154 --> 00:32:35.650
or the &gt;?
 

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:36.809
So which one?
 

00:32:36.809 --> 00:32:45.980
&gt;
 

00:32:45.980 --> 00:33:10.098
&gt;
 

00:33:10.098 --> 00:33:11.916
Prof: Now he is all the
way--first of all,

00:33:11.916 --> 00:33:13.279
what's the answer to the
question?

00:33:13.279 --> 00:33:14.568
Which theme did he use here?
 

00:33:14.568 --> 00:33:17.538
We're now at the re-transition,
we're almost finished this

00:33:17.538 --> 00:33:18.579
short development.
 

00:33:18.579 --> 00:33:19.539
Which one did he use?
 

00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:20.859
Who thinks they know?
 

00:33:20.859 --> 00:33:21.630
Raise your hand.
 

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:23.548
Elizabeth?
 

00:33:23.548 --> 00:33:24.490
Student: The closing
theme.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:27.421
Prof: Used just the
closing theme

00:33:27.421 --> 00:33:29.150
&gt;
 

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:32.211
so nothing but the closing
theme in this short development

00:33:32.211 --> 00:33:32.750
section.
 

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.964
Now we are at the re-transition
and you're going to hear the

00:33:35.964 --> 00:33:38.200
violins come down
&gt;

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.669
but if I could sing the
harmony--Maybe we should all

00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:41.588
sing it together.
 

00:33:41.588 --> 00:33:44.230
We'll be singing
&gt;.

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:46.019
It's the implied bass line.
 

00:33:46.019 --> 00:33:47.220
&gt;
 

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.140
Then it's going to go
&gt;

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:50.288
back to the tonic.
 

00:33:50.288 --> 00:33:51.368
Then we're going to go
&gt;.

00:33:51.368 --> 00:33:54.140
Then that first theme is going
to come back in here.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.261
So let's listen to Mozart write
a re-transition,

00:33:57.261 --> 00:34:00.517
and I'm going to sing the
implied--or then sounded

00:34:00.517 --> 00:34:03.640
dominant that's going to lead to
the tonic.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:09.099
&gt;
 

00:34:09.099 --> 00:34:24.409
&gt;
 

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:28.351
So all of the first theme
material coming back--nothing

00:34:28.351 --> 00:34:28.789
new.
 

00:34:28.789 --> 00:34:38.289
&gt;
 

00:34:38.289 --> 00:34:42.340
Here goes our bridge
now--movement.

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:54.320
&gt;
 

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.989
And he just cut it short.
 

00:34:55.989 --> 00:35:02.329
The first time he went there
&gt;.

00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:03.219
That was what the bass did.
 

00:35:03.219 --> 00:35:06.365
This time he just stops the
thing and stays in the tonic

00:35:06.365 --> 00:35:06.710
key.
 

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.913
And then the rest of the
material will come back in in

00:35:09.913 --> 00:35:12.090
the proper order in the tonic
key.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:13.940
All right, but we need not hear
that.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:17.559
Let's go on now to the coda and
we're just going to listen

00:35:17.559 --> 00:35:21.371
generally to what happens in the
coda here--typical coda with

00:35:21.371 --> 00:35:22.070
Mozart.
 

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:31.789
&gt;
 

00:35:31.789 --> 00:35:34.000
Tonic.
 

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.858
&gt;
 

00:35:37.858 --> 00:35:43.369
&gt;
 

00:35:43.369 --> 00:35:45.228
It's almost stereotypical.
 

00:35:45.228 --> 00:35:45.730
Right?
 

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:56.300
&gt;
 

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.768
You could have written that.
 

00:35:57.768 --> 00:36:00.512
I--even I could have written
that--not so hard,

00:36:00.512 --> 00:36:03.193
but as they say,
it's just a load of bricks to

00:36:03.193 --> 00:36:05.400
bring this thing to a
conclusion.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:09.130
But it's a beautiful example of
sonata-allegro form.

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:13.722
It does what our model requires
in all particulars in an

00:36:13.722 --> 00:36:18.983
unusually rapid rate here--about
six minutes for this particular

00:36:18.983 --> 00:36:20.070
movement.
 

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:23.237
Let's go on to a
rather--another famous example

00:36:23.237 --> 00:36:26.134
of sonata-allegro form,
and that's the beginning of

00:36:26.134 --> 00:36:27.690
your own Beethoven's Fifth
Symphony,

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:29.699
Symphony number Five.
 

00:36:29.699 --> 00:36:31.606
We, of course,
worked with this before and you

00:36:31.606 --> 00:36:34.083
know the beginning,
but let's listen to a bit of

00:36:34.083 --> 00:36:37.338
this and we're going to follow
it through now all the way to

00:36:37.338 --> 00:36:38.967
the--
into the exposition and

00:36:38.967 --> 00:36:41.971
development in terms of form--
not some of the issues we were

00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:43.989
working with before,
but in terms of form.

00:36:43.989 --> 00:36:49.340
&gt;
 

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:54.170
So no introduction--just starts
off with his first motive there,

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:55.780
a four-note motive.
 

00:36:55.780 --> 00:37:09.849
&gt;
 

00:37:09.849 --> 00:37:13.489
And now the bridge is going to
start.

00:37:13.489 --> 00:37:14.469
&gt;
 

00:37:14.469 --> 00:37:18.362
You get a sense of moving from
point A to point B or from first

00:37:18.362 --> 00:37:19.869
theme to second theme.
 

00:37:19.869 --> 00:37:36.360
&gt;
 

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:36.603
Okay.
 

00:37:36.603 --> 00:37:38.992
So we'll pause it there,
and the horn sort of says

00:37:38.992 --> 00:37:40.014
&gt;
 

00:37:40.014 --> 00:37:41.331
&gt;
 

00:37:41.331 --> 00:37:43.572
"yes, this is the end of
the bridge,"

00:37:43.572 --> 00:37:44.889
something like that.
 

00:37:44.889 --> 00:37:48.862
This is the end of that,
and then a new lyrical theme

00:37:48.862 --> 00:37:50.010
will come in.
 

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:54.039
&gt;
 

00:37:54.039 --> 00:37:55.887
What interests--always
interested me here,

00:37:55.887 --> 00:37:57.329
sort of like the
"Jaws"

00:37:57.329 --> 00:37:57.780
movie.
 

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:00.230
You never know when it's safe
to go back in the water.

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:05.800
You've got this nice melody of
&gt;

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.570
but underneath you have
&gt;.

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:14.766
Sort of lurking under there is
this pernicious four-note

00:38:14.766 --> 00:38:15.780
motive.
 

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:16.320
All right.
 

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.237
So let's listen to the second
theme as it starts in the

00:38:19.237 --> 00:38:22.210
violins and then we'll build up
with Beethoven here.

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:37.989
&gt;
 

00:38:37.989 --> 00:38:41.679
Building up dynamics and pitch.
 

00:38:41.679 --> 00:38:56.139
&gt;
 

00:38:56.139 --> 00:38:57.873
A little bit of interstice
here, &lt;&lt;music

00:38:57.873 --> 00:38:58.530
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:38:58.530 --> 00:38:59.940
our closing theme.
 

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:09.090
&gt;
 

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:12.347
A couple of points--note
again--sort of breathe the air

00:39:12.347 --> 00:39:14.340
of this particular performance.
 

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.480
Ah. Okay?
 

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:21.106
It's because we're going to
change to a different recording

00:39:21.106 --> 00:39:21.690
now.
 

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:24.429
Let me comment on the closing
theme.

00:39:24.429 --> 00:39:27.675
Notice how in this symphony
Beethoven once again is obsessed

00:39:27.675 --> 00:39:29.268
with this four-note motive.
 

00:39:29.268 --> 00:39:32.449
We heard it underneath
&gt;

00:39:32.449 --> 00:39:35.369
and at the end how does he
create a closing theme?

00:39:35.369 --> 00:39:45.800
&gt;
 

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:50.250
Well, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:54.166
just coming down an
arpeggio--just taking that

00:39:54.166 --> 00:39:54.688
triad.
 

00:39:54.688 --> 00:39:57.300
&gt;
 

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.909
Is this a major triad or a
minor triad?

00:39:58.909 --> 00:40:01.059
&gt;
 

00:40:01.059 --> 00:40:05.710
What is it in relationship to
the opening tonality?

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:08.659
It's the relative major. Okay?
 

00:40:08.659 --> 00:40:13.557
So it just goes from,
&gt;

00:40:13.557 --> 00:40:17.130
up to &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:18.304
short, short,
short, long,

00:40:18.304 --> 00:40:20.326
so everything's sort of short,
short, short,

00:40:20.326 --> 00:40:20.750
long.
 

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:21.393
All right.
 

00:40:21.393 --> 00:40:25.382
So that's how he constructs the
closing theme--just a different

00:40:25.382 --> 00:40:29.050
configuration of that short,
short, short long motive.

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:32.085
Let's go back now and hear a
different recording and tell me

00:40:32.085 --> 00:40:34.039
what you think about this
recording.

00:40:34.039 --> 00:40:36.347
How does it differ from the
preceding one that we were

00:40:36.347 --> 00:40:37.000
listening to?
 

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.170
 
 

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:45.088
Let's start with the repeat of
the beginning if you can get

00:40:45.088 --> 00:40:49.498
there, repeat of the exposition,
that-- &lt;&lt;music

00:40:49.498 --> 00:40:51.110
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:52.159
Perfect.
 

00:40:52.159 --> 00:41:00.650
&gt;
 

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:02.840
Okay. Any thoughts about that?
 

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:06.010
Just on one playing I know it's
hard.

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:08.427
I should sit the two up here
and play this one four times and

00:41:08.427 --> 00:41:09.960
this one four times,
back and forth.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.570
What about this one though?
 

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:12.860
Yeah.
 

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:13.690
Student:
&gt;

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:15.628
Prof: The second one
sounds faster,

00:41:15.628 --> 00:41:15.960
yeah.
 

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:16.920
It's the same music.
 

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.559
You--they have the same score.
 

00:41:18.559 --> 00:41:24.639
One conductor thinks this
should go &gt;.

00:41:24.639 --> 00:41:29.190
That's how Leonard Bernstein
would do it and did do it.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:34.063
Another conductor--still
living, conducting frequently in

00:41:34.063 --> 00:41:36.586
New York also,
Bernard Haitink

00:41:36.586 --> 00:41:38.849
&gt;.
 

00:41:38.849 --> 00:41:41.936
So it gets through this about--
through this exposition--about

00:41:41.936 --> 00:41:44.719
thirty seconds faster than
Leonard Bernstein did--just a

00:41:44.719 --> 00:41:46.389
difference in interpretation.
 

00:41:46.389 --> 00:41:49.697
So let's listen now quickly,
because it does go quickly,

00:41:49.697 --> 00:41:52.824
to Bernard Haitink's
interpretation of the exposition

00:41:52.824 --> 00:41:54.449
of this first movement.
 

00:41:54.449 --> 00:42:40.070
&gt;
 

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:41.155
Prof: &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:42:41.155 --> 00:42:41.289
Okay.
 

00:42:41.289 --> 00:42:42.190
That's probably enough of that.
 

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:45.239
Let's go on to the development
now.

00:42:45.239 --> 00:42:47.690
Development--well,
how does the development of

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:48.889
this symphony start?
 

00:42:48.889 --> 00:42:51.719
Which theme is he using?
 

00:42:51.719 --> 00:42:53.090
Well, you can imagine.
 

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:59.559
 
 

00:42:59.559 --> 00:43:03.353
Prof: &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:43:03.353 --> 00:43:08.219
His four-note motive
&gt;

00:43:08.219 --> 00:43:14.050
&gt;
 

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:15.900
&gt;
 

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:22.579
--then rather quickly
&gt;

00:43:22.579 --> 00:43:25.170
he modulates through different
keys.

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:28.677
Every time you hear the strings
sweep &lt;&lt;plays

00:43:28.677 --> 00:43:29.730
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:34.679
--we're moving to a new key and
then &gt;

00:43:34.679 --> 00:43:37.880
modulating to a higher key
there.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:50.786
Then he begins to build
up--begins to build up in terms

00:43:50.786 --> 00:44:00.110
of pitch, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:06.161
taking it up higher and higher
and higher, and then we get

00:44:06.161 --> 00:44:09.239
&gt;
 

00:44:09.239 --> 00:44:11.010
that sort of sound.
 

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:16.030
Well, first of all,
let's talk about this chord.

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:17.110
What do you think about that
chord?

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:20.110
&gt;
 

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:22.550
Full of tension, dissonance?
 

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:24.018
Yeah, it has a lot.
 

00:44:24.018 --> 00:44:27.820
It's called a diminished triad
and we have put this up here.

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:30.918
Remember we've had major
triads, with major third in the

00:44:30.918 --> 00:44:32.889
bottom, a minor third on the
top.

00:44:32.889 --> 00:44:34.489
And then we had minor triads.
 

00:44:34.489 --> 00:44:37.967
But what would happen if you
constructed a triad with just a

00:44:37.967 --> 00:44:41.447
minor third on the bottom and
then another minor third-- two

00:44:41.447 --> 00:44:42.449
minor thirds?
 

00:44:42.449 --> 00:44:44.081
Well, you get this sort of more
dissonant sound,

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:45.090
&gt;
 

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:46.570
a more biting sound.
 

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:51.425
So that's what Beethoven is
using here, this dissonant

00:44:51.425 --> 00:44:52.159
triad.
 

00:44:52.159 --> 00:44:55.789
There is another thing that's
quite interesting and that is

00:44:55.789 --> 00:44:59.405
that--
this idea of just pounding away

00:44:59.405 --> 00:45:06.268
on one particular chord,
this sound, &lt;&lt;plays

00:45:06.268 --> 00:45:08.650
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:09.530
that sort of thing.
 

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:11.018
Beethoven started doing this.
 

00:45:11.018 --> 00:45:14.195
Did you ever have your CD
player get-- &lt;&lt;plays

00:45:14.195 --> 00:45:15.130
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:16.489
It drives you crazy, right?
 

00:45:16.489 --> 00:45:19.619
Why is he doing this?
 

00:45:19.619 --> 00:45:22.266
So think about how the audience
of that time would have

00:45:22.266 --> 00:45:23.099
perceived this.
 

00:45:23.099 --> 00:45:26.719
The--what did the Germans of
1808?

00:45:26.719 --> 00:45:29.340
"Ludwig,
Ludwig, was tun Sie hier?

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.780
Die ist nicht die Musik.
 

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:34.139
Sind Sie wacklich? Hier
ist die Musik."

00:45:34.139 --> 00:45:40.315
&gt;
 

00:45:40.315 --> 00:45:43.289
--and so on.
 

00:45:43.289 --> 00:45:49.210
So this is a--this kind of
thing-- &lt;&lt;plays

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:51.099
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:45:51.099 --> 00:45:53.529
It's almost like that kind of
thing they used to use in old

00:45:53.529 --> 00:45:55.706
silent movies and then they tied
her up &lt;&lt;plays

00:45:55.706 --> 00:45:56.420
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:57.672
and then they lit the fuse
&gt;

00:45:57.672 --> 00:45:58.570
and then &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:00.130
they're building up tension.
 

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:02.596
If you take this diminished
triad and keep placing it at

00:46:02.596 --> 00:46:04.570
successively higher degrees of
the scale,

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:09.032
you get this extreme of
tension, and what's he done in

00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:11.389
terms of note values here?
 

00:46:11.389 --> 00:46:15.130
Well, we have this
*.

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:18.739
It's almost as if he's stripped
it down to just one note--

00:46:18.739 --> 00:46:22.268
sort of reduced it to its most
elemental,

00:46:22.268 --> 00:46:24.320
and I--well,
I could give you metaphors

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.719
about taking matter and reducing
them down to some sort of their

00:46:27.719 --> 00:46:31.280
densest potential and atomic
explosions and things like that,

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.449
but &gt;
 

00:46:33.449 --> 00:46:35.530
that's kind of what he's done
here.

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:37.679
He hasn't expanded in the
development section.

00:46:37.679 --> 00:46:41.195
He's contracted,
sort of to maximize the

00:46:41.195 --> 00:46:46.244
rhythmic energy--the almost
electrical energy inherent in

00:46:46.244 --> 00:46:48.768
this particular concept.
 

00:46:48.768 --> 00:46:50.976
Well, all right,
so then he backs off of this

00:46:50.976 --> 00:46:52.429
&gt;
 

00:46:52.429 --> 00:46:58.260
and gets sweeping &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:01.317
and then he starts playing
around with just two notes.

00:47:01.317 --> 00:47:02.989
&gt;
 

00:47:02.989 --> 00:47:03.980
Why two notes?
 

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:07.039
Well, his original theme
&gt;

00:47:07.039 --> 00:47:11.099
had just two notes in it,
and then he breaks it down to

00:47:11.099 --> 00:47:14.181
just one note,
once again reaching for the

00:47:14.181 --> 00:47:15.460
essence here.
 

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:21.041
Now this might not sound like
one note, but here's what he's

00:47:21.041 --> 00:47:21.420
got.
 

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:24.260
&gt;
 

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:25.641
That sounds like high,
low, high, low,

00:47:25.641 --> 00:47:28.030
but if you stop and think about
it &gt;

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:30.704
they're just coming down an
octave, so he's really just

00:47:30.704 --> 00:47:32.043
working with one note here.
 

00:47:32.043 --> 00:47:33.530
&gt;
 

00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:37.820
And then he changes it
&gt;

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:42.735
and then the theme
&gt;

00:47:42.735 --> 00:47:45.250
&gt;
 

00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:47.139
but the diminished chord won't
let it in.

00:47:47.139 --> 00:47:48.510
&gt;
 

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:51.983
He just sort of keeps repeating
that one- note idea,

00:47:51.983 --> 00:47:54.981
high, low, high,
low, high, low &lt;&lt;plays

00:47:54.981 --> 00:47:56.139
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:47:56.139 --> 00:48:01.976
--"please let me in,"
and finally this sort of

00:48:01.976 --> 00:48:06.860
insistent motive &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:10.190
just breaks down the door
&gt;

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:16.561
and then the recapitulation can
begin &lt;&lt;plays

00:48:16.561 --> 00:48:18.217
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:48:18.217 --> 00:48:20.130
--and so on.
 

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:22.170
The recapitulation begins at
that point.

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:28.213
So that's the development
section of the Fifth Symphony

00:48:28.213 --> 00:48:30.139
here,
first movement of the Fifth

00:48:30.139 --> 00:48:31.748
Symphony,
where he puts this electrical

00:48:31.748 --> 00:48:33.603
moment right in the--
smack in the middle of the

00:48:33.603 --> 00:48:35.931
development section--
in the middle of the

00:48:35.931 --> 00:48:39.659
movement--and then we get to the
recapitulation.

00:48:39.659 --> 00:48:42.237
So we've heard some music of
Leonard Bernstein's

00:48:42.237 --> 00:48:43.610
interpretation of this.
 

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:46.980
We've heard Bernard Haitink's
interpretation of this.

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:50.518
Now let's go on to--as you go
out, you can use this as kind of

00:48:50.518 --> 00:48:52.871
exit music,
a silly--a bit of silliness

00:48:52.871 --> 00:48:55.612
here--the Bee Gees'
interpretation of Beethoven's

00:48:55.612 --> 00:48:56.639
Fifth Symphony.
 

00:48:56.639 --> 00:49:25.000

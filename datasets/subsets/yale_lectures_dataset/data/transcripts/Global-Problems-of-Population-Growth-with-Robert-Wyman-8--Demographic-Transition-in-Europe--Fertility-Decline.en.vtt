00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.166
Prof: Last time--so last
time we discussed two factors

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:17.220
that limited--that retarded and
limited your progress.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.503
Remember, I'm describing that
Europe was in a pretty bad

00:00:20.503 --> 00:00:21.220
situation.
 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.100
One was sort of
mental--cultural,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.240
there was a mindset that
largely focused on the

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.010
supernatural and did not have
that mindset to question

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.140
received wisdom and to test
whatever they believed against

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.110
what they saw in reality.
 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.228
The second was a food and
population balance that left

00:00:46.228 --> 00:00:51.830
vast numbers of people in
conditions of near starvation.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.444
Around 1750--around 1700,
Europe started to outgrow these

00:00:57.444 --> 00:01:03.259
limitations and we started
talking about that last time.

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:05.959
We saw how the scientific
revolution,

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:09.805
given great impetus by Newton,
he wasn't the only one but the

00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:13.778
fabulous success in explaining
the universe that Newton's three

00:01:13.778 --> 00:01:16.366
very simple laws--
you learned that certainly in

00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.110
high school if not in junior
high school--

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:26.027
explained how all the heavens
work and that was an amazing

00:01:26.027 --> 00:01:34.083
creation of the human mind and
it had tremendous import and

00:01:34.083 --> 00:01:40.890
started what's been called the
Enlightenment.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.403
That sort of changed the mental
set into something more

00:01:44.403 --> 00:01:47.415
progressive,
and then as you've read in--I

00:01:47.415 --> 00:01:51.343
hope in your course packet the
introduction of foods from

00:01:51.343 --> 00:01:55.666
America sort of cut down--
got rid of the physical

00:01:55.666 --> 00:02:01.730
limitation on population and
economic well being in Europe,

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.950
that the amount of food went
way up.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.467
So this--especially the
food--increased the European

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:10.620
population.
 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:16.974
There's all kinds of different
numbers available but anywhere

00:02:16.974 --> 00:02:23.542
from 62% up to a doubling of the
European population due to the

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:27.250
introduction of American foods.
 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.149
Now the standard belief about
population at that time was that

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:34.878
population is a wonderful thing.
 

00:02:34.878 --> 00:02:36.699
Jean-Jacques Rousseau who we've
talked about,

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:40.169
who was abandoning his own
children by the car load to

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:42.460
control his individual
family's--

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.818
the number of children they had
to cope with--

00:02:44.818 --> 00:02:47.098
in terms when he thought about
the grand--

00:02:47.098 --> 00:02:51.911
the political system he said,
"that government under

00:02:51.911 --> 00:02:56.206
which the citizens do most
increase and multiply is

00:02:56.206 --> 00:02:58.270
infallibly the best.
 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.450
Similarly, the government under
which a people diminishes in

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.568
number and wastes away is the
worst."

00:03:05.568 --> 00:03:11.360
He's very clear that not only
is high population good but it's

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.068
infallibly good.
 

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:16.699
Benjamin Franklin,
around 1751,

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:19.120
argues about this.
 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.614
"There were upwards of one
million English souls in

00:03:22.614 --> 00:03:25.598
America,"
This is before the Revolution.

00:03:25.598 --> 00:03:28.847
"This million doubling
supposed but once in 25

00:03:28.847 --> 00:03:32.937
years," which is not a bad
estimate of the doubling time of

00:03:32.937 --> 00:03:35.991
American population at that
time, due largely to

00:03:35.991 --> 00:03:37.160
immigration.
 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.819
"Doubling once every 25
years, within and another--will,

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.169
in another century be more than
the people of England.

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.860
What an accession of power that
will be."

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.264
And the realization of American
increase in numbers and

00:03:53.264 --> 00:03:57.236
therefore increase in power was
very important in the history of

00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:58.120
that time.
 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.750
After the French and Indian
War, before our Revolution that

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.908
you know of,
the settlement that the English

00:04:04.908 --> 00:04:07.485
got Canada,
which was barren wasn't worth

00:04:07.485 --> 00:04:10.961
very much at the time,
and the French kept the islands

00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:13.620
in the Atlantic which were very
rich,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.000
sugar and plantations,
slavery of course.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.079
The French kept those and the
English took Canada.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:20.374
Why?
 

00:04:20.374 --> 00:04:24.494
To keep the Americans in check
because they knew that the

00:04:24.494 --> 00:04:27.069
Americans would get very strong.
 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:31.999
Thomas Jefferson often said,
'population is power,' so in

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:33.759
1800 when the U.S.
 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.117
was only ten years old,
so very fragile in terms of our

00:04:38.117 --> 00:04:41.750
military strength and everything
like that.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.990
Napoleon had recently--Spain
had owned Louisiana which was

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.379
the whole vast territory to the
west of the 13 colonies,

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:56.519
and during the Napoleonic Wars,
Napoleon got charge of them.

00:04:56.519 --> 00:05:00.012
He was going to send French
troops there to occupy Louisiana

00:05:00.012 --> 00:05:03.089
because they were such a big and
important territory,

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:05.338
but the U.S.,
of course, objected.

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:07.560
We were having this huge
population growth,

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.624
immigration,
they were flooding over the

00:05:09.624 --> 00:05:12.110
Appalachian Mountains into the
territories.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.918
The next boundary was the
Mississippi River,

00:05:14.918 --> 00:05:18.642
and America did not want any of
the European powers taking

00:05:18.642 --> 00:05:19.819
control there.
 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.415
The French Ambassador in
America realized that America

00:05:23.415 --> 00:05:27.555
was growing so rapidly in power
and he thought Napoleon's idea

00:05:27.555 --> 00:05:31.009
to send troops was stupid,
that Napoleon would lose the

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:31.250
war.
 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.629
This guy was very clever,
he did one thing,

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:39.699
he sent to Napoleon a summary
of the American Census of 1800.

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.437
Remember that in The
Constitution we have to take a

00:05:42.437 --> 00:05:42.930
census.
 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.817
There was one taken in 1800 and
it showed such a great rate of

00:05:46.817 --> 00:05:50.769
American population increase
that that's all he had to send.

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:52.091
It showed that the U.S.
 

00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:55.197
population was doubling every
22 years, not the 25 that

00:05:55.197 --> 00:05:57.209
Benjamin Franklin had estimated.
 

00:05:57.209 --> 00:06:01.290
Napoleon got the message
immediately;

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.119
there was no way that France
was going to be able to hold

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:06.139
Louisiana against American
objections.

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:08.879
What did Napoleon do?
 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:12.172
Sold it to us for a pittance,
basically a pittance,

00:06:12.172 --> 00:06:14.740
because he knew he could not
hold it;

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.889
the power of population.
 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.009
Now why did governments love
large populations?

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:21.399
Why was it power?
 

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:25.629
Two things, one a lot of men
and what do you do with men?

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:29.240
Take them into the army so you
have big military power,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.581
also more people farm more
land, produce more food,

00:06:32.581 --> 00:06:33.920
and other goods.
 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.339
Then what can you do?
 

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:38.817
You can tax it,
so the governments get a lot of

00:06:38.817 --> 00:06:43.050
tax and a lot of people if they
have a big population.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.242
There was no question in
anyone's mind that a big and

00:06:47.242 --> 00:06:51.759
growing population was just a
wonderful sort of thing.

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:55.331
What they didn't realize is one
of the things that I'm trying to

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:59.567
get across in this class,
that that system works for a

00:06:59.567 --> 00:07:05.338
situation where you have no
limitation on land or resources.

00:07:05.338 --> 00:07:09.101
It's like I've been--I was
describing for Africa where the

00:07:09.101 --> 00:07:11.939
population was small and land
was large,

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:16.829
then population is--can be a
benefit in the way just

00:07:16.829 --> 00:07:17.980
described.
 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.841
The reality,
for Europe especially,

00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:22.189
was different.
 

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:26.788
After 1750, again largely due
to the American foods,

00:07:26.788 --> 00:07:31.567
people filled the European
countrysides to overflowing

00:07:31.567 --> 00:07:32.740
capacity.
 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.230
These are quotes from various
sources back then.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.377
"Mountains spilled over
with people, cities grew and the

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:44.591
plains became full,
but this increase in population

00:07:44.591 --> 00:07:47.110
brought more mouths to feed.
 

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.925
Population rose and the
resources could not match the

00:07:50.925 --> 00:07:52.319
population."
 

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:55.240
When you have more consumers
then goods,

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.209
law of supply and demand,
prices rose,

00:07:58.209 --> 00:08:01.120
people couldn't afford what
they previously could afford,

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.980
and poverty deepened.
 

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:09.065
In this period in Europe people
often moved--migrated seasonally

00:08:09.065 --> 00:08:13.910
to get jobs because they didn't
have enough income from their

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:14.959
own land.
 

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:16.550
They would go to where some
harvest--

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.045
they were needed to harvest or
needed to work on a building

00:08:19.045 --> 00:08:21.146
project,
but at this time this

00:08:21.146 --> 00:08:25.870
population of people wandering
around looking for some sort of

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:30.285
work increased so much that the
line between migration and

00:08:30.285 --> 00:08:33.780
vagabondage,
becoming just a vagabond,

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:38.070
was crossed by hundreds of
thousands of Europeans.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:42.010
They were just wandering around
looking for some kind of work to

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.639
keep them alive for a little bit
longer.

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:47.950
This was written--noticed and
written about a lot at the time.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:52.225
They flooded the highways,
roads were opening up at the

00:08:52.225 --> 00:08:52.779
time.
 

00:08:52.779 --> 00:08:55.341
They flooded the highways of
France, Germany,

00:08:55.341 --> 00:08:58.020
the low countries,
all of these places this was

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:58.720
noticed.
 

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.562
Children at the time--again you
read there's crowded orphanages

00:09:02.562 --> 00:09:05.988
and foundling homes,
women and children--very large

00:09:05.988 --> 00:09:08.519
number of beggars arose at this
time.

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:13.100
Women and children begged on
church steps and on roadsides.

00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:22.629
This problem of poverty as I've
mentioned was much observed,

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:25.090
much worried about,
much commented upon,

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.481
and in fact,
all of the great intellectuals

00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:30.006
of the day,
whose names we still know,

00:09:30.006 --> 00:09:31.269
commented upon it.
 

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:33.690
You all know Edward Gibbon?
 

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.498
Gibbon wrote,
The Decline and Fall of the

00:09:36.498 --> 00:09:39.044
Roman Empire,
one of the most famous

00:09:39.044 --> 00:09:41.070
intellectuals of that time.
 

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.638
Right after that he wrote,
"In the civilized world

00:09:45.638 --> 00:09:50.037
the most numerous class is
condemned to ignorance and

00:09:50.037 --> 00:09:51.559
poverty."
 

00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:52.798
Why were people poor?
 

00:09:52.798 --> 00:09:56.090
Well the general consideration
then: they were poor because

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.019
they were in some way deficient.
 

00:09:58.019 --> 00:10:00.639
The idea was that God had given
some people--

00:10:00.639 --> 00:10:03.998
kings and aristocrats--the
abilities and capability to rule

00:10:03.998 --> 00:10:07.298
and all the others were
relegated to the lower classes.

00:10:07.298 --> 00:10:09.840
They just didn't--they had bad
heredity,

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.282
they were lazy,
they were "the wrong

00:10:13.282 --> 00:10:18.788
sort," they were inherently
incapable that their nature,

00:10:18.788 --> 00:10:21.000
their human nature,
they didn't really have genetic

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.715
ideas back then,
was to be incapable of leading

00:10:24.715 --> 00:10:26.918
the good kind of life.
 

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:30.202
Well, this was a nice theory
and people who are upper class

00:10:30.202 --> 00:10:33.260
enough to get an education to
write about it could live

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.129
comfortably with that theory.
 

00:10:35.129 --> 00:10:38.946
Then America opens up for
colonization and guess what

00:10:38.946 --> 00:10:39.679
happens?
 

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:41.250
Who moves to America?
 

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.808
The poorest people,
especially from England.

00:10:43.808 --> 00:10:47.309
The lower classes moved to
Australia at a somewhat later

00:10:47.309 --> 00:10:49.350
time,
and then they empty out the

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.466
prisons going to Australia so
they have really the lower

00:10:52.466 --> 00:10:53.090
classes.
 

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:53.879
What happens to America?
 

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:56.649
As I've just showed you the
people work hard,

00:10:56.649 --> 00:10:58.700
they're industrious,
they make a lot of money,

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.841
they get ahead,
everything looks very good in

00:11:01.841 --> 00:11:05.840
America and so the theory just
didn't fit observation.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.860
As I've mentioned,
people are, by now,

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.947
paying attention to what's
around them and this idea that

00:11:11.947 --> 00:11:15.888
Americans had been so poor in
England but they moved to

00:11:15.888 --> 00:11:18.370
America and things get better.
 

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.363
The question arose:
why were the poor so poor in

00:11:21.363 --> 00:11:22.000
England?
 

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.825
Kind of an obvious question;
again not the first time that

00:11:27.825 --> 00:11:29.918
this question had been asked.
 

00:11:29.918 --> 00:11:33.811
The Bible, and again sorry
for--keep referring to religion

00:11:33.811 --> 00:11:36.629
but you cannot,
just cannot discuss Western

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:40.159
intellectual history without
going there because that was the

00:11:40.159 --> 00:11:42.220
basis of the way people thought.
 

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.142
What the Bible says,
Ecclesiastes,

00:11:45.142 --> 00:11:50.190
'when goods increase they are
increased that eat them.'

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:53.821
If you have more stuff,
population grows and they eat

00:11:53.821 --> 00:11:54.590
the food.
 

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:59.308
Very close to what we'll see
Malthus says later.

00:11:59.308 --> 00:12:01.940
Edmund Burke,
who as you know is now

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.397
considered the father of
conservative political

00:12:05.397 --> 00:12:09.755
philosophy: "The laboring
people are only poor because

00:12:09.755 --> 00:12:13.695
they are numerous;
numbers in their nature imply

00:12:13.695 --> 00:12:14.798
poverty."
 

00:12:14.798 --> 00:12:18.422
In a fair distribution--what
liberals were saying share

00:12:18.422 --> 00:12:21.123
equally,
"In a fair distribution

00:12:21.123 --> 00:12:24.558
among a vast multitude none can
have much."

00:12:24.558 --> 00:12:27.678
He was talking against
spreading the wealth because

00:12:27.678 --> 00:12:31.234
under that condition if you
spread the wealth everybody is

00:12:31.234 --> 00:12:32.418
extremely poor.
 

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:35.953
Those kind of thoughts started
people thinking about the

00:12:35.953 --> 00:12:39.039
relationship between population
and resources.

00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:40.029
What was that?
 

00:12:40.029 --> 00:12:43.371
There's this sort of a fairly
new way of thinking about

00:12:43.371 --> 00:12:43.929
things.
 

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:45.418
Where did they turn to?
 

00:12:45.418 --> 00:12:47.879
Again, in the spirit of the
Enlightenment,

00:12:47.879 --> 00:12:52.962
science was the leading source
of intellectual new ideas and

00:12:52.962 --> 00:12:57.634
natural history was going on--
was getting going at that time,

00:12:57.634 --> 00:13:01.278
studying of plants and animals
in their natural habitats,

00:13:01.278 --> 00:13:05.908
just like all your TAs for this
course.

00:13:05.908 --> 00:13:09.307
Adam Smith, among others,
paid great attention to what

00:13:09.307 --> 00:13:11.230
the naturalists were saying.
 

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.658
In The Wealth of
Nations,

00:13:12.658 --> 00:13:17.558
1776, "Every species of
animal naturally multiples in

00:13:17.558 --> 00:13:22.886
proportion to the means of their
subsistence and no species can

00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:25.808
ever multiply beyond it."
 

00:13:25.808 --> 00:13:28.936
Then he explicitly says,
"Men, like all other

00:13:28.936 --> 00:13:32.635
animals, naturally multiply in
proportion to their means of

00:13:32.635 --> 00:13:34.038
subsistence."
 

00:13:34.038 --> 00:13:40.809
So he's immediately applying an
ecological law from the study of

00:13:40.809 --> 00:13:42.960
animals to people.
 

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.950
Well how fast can humans
multiply?

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:49.620
David Hume, another one of the
luminous philosophers,

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:54.191
1742: "Almost every man
who thinks he can maintain a

00:13:54.191 --> 00:13:58.533
family will have one,
and the human species at this

00:13:58.533 --> 00:14:02.395
rate of propagation would more
than double every

00:14:02.395 --> 00:14:04.038
generation."
 

00:14:04.038 --> 00:14:07.320
Adam Smith again got some of
the problem;

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:12.235
he realized that if wages
increased, if things started to

00:14:12.235 --> 00:14:17.590
get better and wages increased,
this would lead to an increase

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.168
in population.
 

00:14:19.168 --> 00:14:21.489
He explicitly says,
if people have more money

00:14:21.489 --> 00:14:24.652
they're going to be able to feed
their children more and they

00:14:24.652 --> 00:14:27.216
will stay alive,
and there will be a decline in

00:14:27.216 --> 00:14:30.840
mortality,
and the population will grow.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.190
He--very surprising--did not
close the circle and did not--

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:39.384
never apparently realized that
this growth in the population

00:14:39.384 --> 00:14:44.668
would mean more competitors for
the jobs and would push wages

00:14:44.668 --> 00:14:46.428
back down again.
 

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:49.491
That was the great achievement
of Malthus--and all this

00:14:49.491 --> 00:14:52.894
interest in what is the cause of
poverty, and there were many

00:14:52.894 --> 00:14:53.860
other things.
 

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:58.082
There was an enclosure movement
in England at the time where the

00:14:58.082 --> 00:15:02.172
lands on which the peasants had
lived were being closed in and

00:15:02.172 --> 00:15:05.178
controlled by the squires,
the country squires and so

00:15:05.178 --> 00:15:06.970
forth;
a lot of other things going on.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:11.301
This was the kind of
argumentation that was going on

00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:12.490
at the time.
 

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:16.702
Malthus was the one that
realized that population and

00:15:16.702 --> 00:15:21.322
wages and mortality were in a
negative--what we now call a

00:15:21.322 --> 00:15:23.509
negative feedback loop.
 

00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:27.038
If wages increased,
as I've just said,

00:15:27.038 --> 00:15:30.826
then population grows and if
population grows the competition

00:15:30.826 --> 00:15:34.423
for jobs and for food and for
everything else pushes wages

00:15:34.423 --> 00:15:37.738
back down,
or pushes prices back up so if

00:15:37.738 --> 00:15:41.288
you earn the same you're still
getting less.

00:15:41.288 --> 00:15:45.817
In short, although the
population could grow and the

00:15:45.817 --> 00:15:50.966
economy on a gross scale could
grow, the per capita income,

00:15:50.966 --> 00:15:54.340
he basically said,
could not grow.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.210
In the strongest statement of
this,

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.975
and he went through many
editions with many different

00:15:59.975 --> 00:16:02.869
statements,
but in the strongest statement

00:16:02.869 --> 00:16:05.950
economic progress is basically
impossible;

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:10.048
looked at from the point of
view of per capita income,

00:16:10.048 --> 00:16:13.528
the living standards of the
average person.

00:16:13.528 --> 00:16:17.414
Malthus was very clever and
thought more deeply about it and

00:16:17.414 --> 00:16:20.707
he was aware of two
contradictory changes that were

00:16:20.707 --> 00:16:23.870
happening throughout the
eighteenth century;

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:28.592
he writes in 1798,
at the end of the eighteenth

00:16:28.592 --> 00:16:29.620
century.
 

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.044
As I've mentioned and you've
read there's no question that

00:16:32.044 --> 00:16:34.879
agriculture was improving,
not only American foods,

00:16:34.879 --> 00:16:38.812
but also agronomy was coming in
as a science and people were

00:16:38.812 --> 00:16:40.934
learning,
even with the same crops,

00:16:40.934 --> 00:16:43.605
to improve the crops,
to improve their livestock,

00:16:43.605 --> 00:16:46.668
to fertilize better,
to rotate fields better.

00:16:46.668 --> 00:16:52.269
They were learning to grow more
food.

00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:55.820
Nevertheless,
even though there was more food

00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:00.500
around poverty was growing,
and that was also very clear at

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.548
the time.
 

00:17:01.548 --> 00:17:07.410
His argument is based on a few
very simple kinds of statements.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:11.546
Contrary to some previous
thinkers who envisioned the

00:17:11.546 --> 00:17:16.240
relation between population and
resources as there's a fixed

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.150
amount of resources.
 

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.950
There's a pie.
 

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.207
We now use the expression pie;
there's a pie and depending on

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:26.000
how many people there are you
divide the pie into smaller and

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.140
smaller slices.
 

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.990
The more people,
the smaller slices of the pie.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:34.910
That is completely wrong and
never has been correct.

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:42.124
All people do some kind of work
and the pie grows with each

00:17:42.124 --> 00:17:45.777
person some--
the pie grows to a certain

00:17:45.777 --> 00:17:49.558
degree and the question is how
much does the pie grow?

00:17:49.558 --> 00:17:51.987
For instance again,
in the United States at the

00:17:51.987 --> 00:17:54.530
time,
we had these vast lands to the

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:58.775
west where we were killing or
had killed the Indians and they

00:17:58.775 --> 00:18:02.619
were very few of them anyway,
so that allowed each new

00:18:02.619 --> 00:18:04.950
person--so as the population
grows--

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:08.160
again when you have no
limitation of resources--

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.940
a new family is living on the
frontier,

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.759
the frontier becomes crowded.
 

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:14.818
American population was growing
very fast;

00:18:14.818 --> 00:18:16.810
they were having lots of kids,
lots of immigrants,

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:17.990
where do the new people go?
 

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:21.567
They just move some miles to
the west and they get a

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:25.988
beautiful new farm and the land
is just as good as what was left

00:18:25.988 --> 00:18:29.987
behind and they grow as much as
the farmers that they left

00:18:29.987 --> 00:18:30.900
behind.
 

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:34.690
The population increases,
the gross economy increases,

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:39.744
and the per capita standard of
living does not decrease because

00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:44.309
this guy has the same amount of
resources as the previous

00:18:44.309 --> 00:18:45.858
generation had.
 

00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:49.781
This was not the condition in
Europe, or in England,

00:18:49.781 --> 00:18:53.318
or the rest of--actually all
across Eurasia.

00:18:53.318 --> 00:18:57.595
Here the law of diminishing
returns takes effect because

00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:59.848
land starts to be limiting.
 

00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:02.950
When land is limiting--people
are naturally smart,

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:04.088
what do they do?
 

00:19:04.088 --> 00:19:07.848
If there's beautiful land,
fertile land by a river,

00:19:07.848 --> 00:19:11.451
of course they farm that first,
and so as the population grows

00:19:11.451 --> 00:19:14.768
that gets taken up,
all the good land comes under

00:19:14.768 --> 00:19:16.298
the plow and is good.
 

00:19:16.298 --> 00:19:20.181
Population keeps growing,
well the next set of people

00:19:20.181 --> 00:19:24.296
have to go to less good land,
maybe drier land,

00:19:24.296 --> 00:19:28.372
maybe hillier land,
and their productivity is not

00:19:28.372 --> 00:19:32.390
quite as good as the previous
group that got the best land.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:36.692
Population keeps growing and
people have to move high on the

00:19:36.692 --> 00:19:38.729
mountaintops,
into dry areas,

00:19:38.729 --> 00:19:40.990
into desert areas,
into swampy areas,

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:46.471
in all kinds of areas where
their production is not going to

00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:47.680
be as high.
 

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.420
The average income,
from say farming,

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:58.250
decreases as you use less good
land and so things--

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:02.076
conditions get worse and
finally all the land is used up

00:20:02.076 --> 00:20:05.210
and there's no land for farmers
whatsoever.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:09.960
This is the law of diminishing
returns.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:14.103
If you travel around you can
really see the law of

00:20:14.103 --> 00:20:19.128
diminishing returns happen--
a mix of how people always do

00:20:19.128 --> 00:20:22.298
some work,
but when there isn't much

00:20:22.298 --> 00:20:27.690
resource to take advantage of
they can accomplish very little.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:32.250
Quite a few years ago I was
traveling in the highlands of

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:35.308
Bolivia and Peru,
and a lot of native Indian

00:20:35.308 --> 00:20:37.125
markets there--
very colorful,

00:20:37.125 --> 00:20:41.366
tourists love to go to them--
but you watch the ladies sit

00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:46.241
down and they have a blanket in
front of them and they display

00:20:46.241 --> 00:20:49.933
their wares and they--
it's all agricultural and

00:20:49.933 --> 00:20:53.192
they'll have maybe a few fruits,
and a little bit of this and a

00:20:53.192 --> 00:20:56.231
little bit of that,
and they have almost nothing,

00:20:56.231 --> 00:20:58.848
almost no stock on the blanket.
 

00:20:58.848 --> 00:21:02.259
They've grown this over the
past say months or something;

00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:05.045
they've walked all the way
maybe even days to get to a

00:21:05.045 --> 00:21:07.618
market, and then they have very
little to sell.

00:21:07.618 --> 00:21:10.786
Even if they could sell
everything that they brought at

00:21:10.786 --> 00:21:13.660
some sort of a profit they
didn't have enough--

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:18.412
their total amount that they
would take home was still very,

00:21:18.412 --> 00:21:19.538
very little.
 

00:21:19.538 --> 00:21:23.358
They were producing some,
but not very much.

00:21:23.358 --> 00:21:25.298
In the cities--I have to tell
you one story.

00:21:25.298 --> 00:21:28.848
I was in Lima in Peru,
this same trip,

00:21:28.848 --> 00:21:32.597
and a lot of street vendors
doing stuff and I saw one guy

00:21:32.597 --> 00:21:36.366
had a pair of socks up there,
and he had some sort of a

00:21:36.366 --> 00:21:38.318
knitting needle or something.
 

00:21:38.318 --> 00:21:41.078
He was holding up the sock and
as he was talking to the crowd,

00:21:41.078 --> 00:21:43.700
jabbing the sock with his
knitting needle,

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.194
and he was saying,
'You can't destroy this sock.

00:21:45.194 --> 00:21:46.150
You can't destroy this sock.
 

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.598
It'll last the rest of your
life.' Bash, bash,

00:21:48.598 --> 00:21:48.980
bash.
 

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.431
I'm watching for a while and
I'm skeptical but the socks

00:21:52.431 --> 00:21:53.309
seemed okay.
 

00:21:53.309 --> 00:21:56.140
I thought, the poor guy;
I bought the pair of socks.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.003
Those socks,
I could not destroy them,

00:21:59.003 --> 00:22:01.559
I used them for about 20 years.
 

00:22:01.559 --> 00:22:02.308
It was really true.
 

00:22:02.308 --> 00:22:07.090
He was making some sort of a
meager living but it wasn't

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:07.700
good.
 

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:12.825
If he had a better job,
if there were more resources

00:22:12.825 --> 00:22:18.753
that he could utilize--his low
wages would not drag down the

00:22:18.753 --> 00:22:19.960
average.
 

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.622
You must realize of course that
when one says a phrase like

00:22:22.622 --> 00:22:24.311
that,
that he could--there were

00:22:24.311 --> 00:22:26.108
resources that he could
utilize--

00:22:26.108 --> 00:22:29.880
brings up a vast consideration
of power and everything else.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.651
What other resources and who
gets to utilize them and so

00:22:33.651 --> 00:22:34.200
forth.
 

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.827
It's a much more--of course I
say a little bit and there's

00:22:38.827 --> 00:22:42.970
much, much more to say about all
of these things.

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:49.512
The law of diminishing returns
reduces the average

00:22:49.512 --> 00:22:53.238
productivity,
but there's a counter-veiling

00:22:53.238 --> 00:22:56.470
trend which he also was aware of
that I've just mentioned.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.500
That the productivity of the
land was increasing,

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.538
again through the new foods and
new agricultural technologies.

00:23:03.538 --> 00:23:07.090
These two factors work in
opposite directions,

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:11.746
and Malthus had to make some
sort of a guess as to how these

00:23:11.746 --> 00:23:14.430
two factors would balance out.
 

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.578
Which would predominate?
 

00:23:16.578 --> 00:23:20.604
Would the introduction of new
technology improve faster than

00:23:20.604 --> 00:23:23.808
the law of diminishing returns
decreased it,

00:23:23.808 --> 00:23:27.972
and his conclusion was that
technology would be somewhat

00:23:27.972 --> 00:23:31.833
stronger then the law of
diminishing returns so that

00:23:31.833 --> 00:23:35.021
total productivity--
per capita productivity and

00:23:35.021 --> 00:23:38.848
total productivity--
would indeed keep increasing.

00:23:38.848 --> 00:23:42.988
He thought it would increase
sort of at a constant sort of a

00:23:42.988 --> 00:23:43.480
rate.
 

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:52.093
In graph terms,
let me see if I can get right

00:23:52.093 --> 00:24:04.230
to this graph--here's--this is
the standard kind of graph about

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:06.578
Malthus.
 

00:24:06.578 --> 00:24:08.940
Here is the way he thought that
resources,

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.806
mostly food in his--in the
case--the time that he was

00:24:12.806 --> 00:24:16.086
talking about--
he thought they would increase

00:24:16.086 --> 00:24:20.087
in a more or less regular way,
per every year if you consider

00:24:20.087 --> 00:24:20.890
these years.
 

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:23.880
Every year would increase by
about the same amount.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.490
He called that an arithmetic
growth.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:32.710
We now call it a linear growth.
 

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:37.288
He and everyone else knew that
population can grow faster than

00:24:37.288 --> 00:24:41.943
that, so you probably understand
a little bit about exponential

00:24:41.943 --> 00:24:42.769
growth.
 

00:24:42.769 --> 00:24:45.519
If each couple has four
surviving children,

00:24:45.519 --> 00:24:48.480
not unreasonable when there's a
moderate amount of food,

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.500
and then these children have
four and so on,

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.029
the population does not grow
4,6, 8,

00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:57.519
10,12--a linear kind of thing.
 

00:24:57.519 --> 00:25:01.406
It grows 4,8,
16,32, 64 you're used to

00:25:01.406 --> 00:25:04.558
counting this way from bits.
 

00:25:04.558 --> 00:25:08.343
That's called exponential
growth where each generation

00:25:08.343 --> 00:25:11.269
doubles or improves by some
percentage.

00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:16.278
I've just made this graph at
growing 10% a year.

00:25:16.278 --> 00:25:19.470
No matter where you--and the
growth is like that,

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:22.222
that's an exponential curve,
and all exponential curves look

00:25:22.222 --> 00:25:24.653
like that,
you can change your scales but

00:25:24.653 --> 00:25:26.660
they all look exactly like that.
 

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.288
It doesn't matter where you
start.

00:25:29.288 --> 00:25:34.034
You can start in England where
these two curves would be pretty

00:25:34.034 --> 00:25:38.855
much matched at the time Malthus
was writing or you can start in

00:25:38.855 --> 00:25:42.988
America where resources are way
above population at the

00:25:42.988 --> 00:25:45.609
beginning,
but then you just wait,

00:25:45.609 --> 00:25:48.480
America starts filling up more
and more rapidly,

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.598
as the population grows.
 

00:25:49.598 --> 00:25:53.468
10% of a large population adds
more people in a year then 10%

00:25:53.468 --> 00:25:56.472
of a small population,
so as time goes on the

00:25:56.472 --> 00:25:59.259
increment per year gets bigger
and bigger,

00:25:59.259 --> 00:26:05.818
and eventually it outruns
resource growth.

00:26:05.818 --> 00:26:10.752
This was Malthus' mathematical
formulation of his ideas and he

00:26:10.752 --> 00:26:14.796
believed it to be an
inevitability that this was an

00:26:14.796 --> 00:26:19.167
iron law of economics,
and that you couldn't avoid

00:26:19.167 --> 00:26:24.112
this and so human population was
doomed to a per capita misery

00:26:24.112 --> 00:26:25.490
kind of thing.
 

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:28.934
He put it in this particular
mathematical form,

00:26:28.934 --> 00:26:32.530
but as you can see,
the mathematical form doesn't

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:33.880
really matter.
 

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.810
As long as population can grow
faster than resources you're

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:40.930
eventually going to get into
this situation.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:44.000
Even if population grows
linearly, if it grows at a

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.950
faster pace than resources,
you're back into this

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:47.808
situation.
 

00:26:47.808 --> 00:26:53.907
The idea, the simple idea is
that population can grow

00:26:53.907 --> 00:26:59.798
faster than resources and I
think that's for sure true.

00:26:59.798 --> 00:27:05.980
Malthus was certainly partly
correct.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.630
He was right and he was also
wrong,

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:12.064
and he has been--you've
probably heard Malthus always

00:27:12.064 --> 00:27:16.160
gets discussed since he wrote a
big subject of controversy,

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.970
and I think the current sort of
fashion is to,

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:19.828
is to put him down.
 

00:27:19.828 --> 00:27:23.058
How many people have heard
discussions of Malthus?

00:27:23.058 --> 00:27:26.250
In how many does he come out
well?

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:29.250
How many does he come out badly?
 

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.798
It's about split.
 

00:27:31.798 --> 00:27:37.361
In certain kinds of circles
it's unfashionable to be a

00:27:37.361 --> 00:27:39.670
Malthusian nowadays.
 

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:43.108
He was right and he was wrong,
and what was he right about?

00:27:43.108 --> 00:27:45.403
First he had
apparently--although the

00:27:45.403 --> 00:27:48.269
historians argue about
this--quite an accurate

00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:49.288
description.
 

00:27:49.288 --> 00:27:54.661
This Malthusian situation is an
accurate description of Europe

00:27:54.661 --> 00:27:57.920
from about 1200 to into the
1700s,

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:01.804
so for about 500 years very
strong arguments can be made

00:28:01.804 --> 00:28:05.616
with whatever data is available
that Europe was in this

00:28:05.616 --> 00:28:07.028
Malthusian trap.
 

00:28:07.028 --> 00:28:09.818
It also, as I'll show you in a
minute,

00:28:09.818 --> 00:28:12.720
that as the industrial
revolution took hold,

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.259
he was still right for almost
another century,

00:28:15.259 --> 00:28:18.180
and then things changed.
 

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.497
He didn't have this--he had a
crystal ball,

00:28:20.497 --> 00:28:22.923
he was pretty good,
but he didn't have a real

00:28:22.923 --> 00:28:24.578
modern model crystal ball.
 

00:28:24.578 --> 00:28:31.470
There are two things that he
did not foresee.

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:35.144
He lived at the very beginning
of the industrial revolution and

00:28:35.144 --> 00:28:37.220
didn't really realize it's
power.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.939
So when he saw it,
he thought he thought

00:28:38.939 --> 00:28:41.700
production of all sorts,
not only agriculture,

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:46.185
would increase kind of linearly
but constant increments every

00:28:46.185 --> 00:28:48.474
year,
but in fact the way it has

00:28:48.474 --> 00:28:51.580
turned out is that not only can
population increase

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.238
exponentially,
but production can increase

00:28:54.238 --> 00:28:57.070
exponentially,
and for the same reason

00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.990
basically.
 

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:00.818
When you produce,
if you're in this scientific--

00:29:00.818 --> 00:29:06.720
this post enlightenment era
where we know science makes life

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.082
better--
then as your economy increases

00:29:10.082 --> 00:29:14.650
you have more money and you
devote a certain fraction of it

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:18.103
to research,
to a technology and so as your

00:29:18.103 --> 00:29:22.199
economy grows every year you put
more and more money into

00:29:22.199 --> 00:29:25.309
research,
so in the same way that if it's

00:29:25.309 --> 00:29:27.818
a percentage of your total
income--

00:29:27.818 --> 00:29:30.818
total national income or
something that you invest,

00:29:30.818 --> 00:29:33.338
and you get a good product out
of it then just like population,

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:36.288
every year you will have more
income,

00:29:36.288 --> 00:29:39.769
more gross national product,
more when you invest a certain

00:29:39.769 --> 00:29:44.184
fraction you have more,
and also technology and science

00:29:44.184 --> 00:29:46.118
grows exponentially.
 

00:29:46.118 --> 00:29:51.076
What happened is that
eventually technology

00:29:51.076 --> 00:29:56.268
grew--production--just as fast
as population,

00:29:56.268 --> 00:30:00.044
and in fact,
somewhat faster than

00:30:00.044 --> 00:30:02.048
population.
 

00:30:02.048 --> 00:30:05.354
We sort of realized that when
we say that our economy grows

00:30:05.354 --> 00:30:09.087
like 2% a year we don't say--
we sometimes say it grew by a

00:30:09.087 --> 00:30:11.713
$100 million dollars year,
something like that,

00:30:11.713 --> 00:30:13.671
but more often--
which is a linear statement,

00:30:13.671 --> 00:30:15.269
$100 million,
$100 million,

00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:19.329
$100 million--but if you say 2%
then next year you have 2% of

00:30:19.329 --> 00:30:23.414
102%,
and then next year 2% of 104%,

00:30:23.414 --> 00:30:26.660
it grows faster and faster.
 

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:31.710
Again, this kind of percentage
increase in technology in

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:36.670
production has exactly the same
limit as population.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.440
That there must be no external
limits;

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:42.519
no resources that are limiting.
 

00:30:42.519 --> 00:30:46.607
Now of course we realize we do
have to worry about the limits

00:30:46.607 --> 00:30:48.039
of the environment.
 

00:30:48.039 --> 00:30:51.926
People have multiplied;
people have basically filled up

00:30:51.926 --> 00:30:54.881
the earth and the--
we're using everything that

00:30:54.881 --> 00:30:58.210
looks like we're using virtually
everything that humans can use,

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:00.220
and there's not much left.
 

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:04.593
So the question is,
can we continue to increase our

00:31:04.593 --> 00:31:05.730
production?
 

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:09.838
We don't know the answer to it.
 

00:31:09.838 --> 00:31:14.288
The second thing that Malthus
didn't foresee was a big drop in

00:31:14.288 --> 00:31:15.528
the birth rate.
 

00:31:15.528 --> 00:31:21.614
He again, acting sort of in the
Newtonian mode of pronouncing

00:31:21.614 --> 00:31:25.670
scientific laws that were
inviolable,

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.397
and inevitable,
he said the sex drive was an

00:31:28.397 --> 00:31:31.724
instinct--
people liked sex--and that

00:31:31.724 --> 00:31:36.660
would not go away so they would
keep reproducing.

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:38.637
Now he was also aware of
contraception,

00:31:38.637 --> 00:31:41.240
people were doing various
things even at that time,

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.220
and it was certainly an
awareness.

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.324
He was so--he was a
minister--he was so morally

00:31:46.324 --> 00:31:50.238
opposed to that that he just
would not really consider that

00:31:50.238 --> 00:31:56.653
people would ever do that,
so he dismissed that kind of

00:31:56.653 --> 00:31:57.578
idea.
 

00:31:57.578 --> 00:32:01.211
What happened,
that in some sense makes him

00:32:01.211 --> 00:32:03.972
wrong,
is that after about another 100

00:32:03.972 --> 00:32:07.490
years after he writes,
production increases enough to

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:11.516
keep up with population and the
birth rate starts dropping and

00:32:11.516 --> 00:32:14.420
we're going to talk about both
of these--

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.140
both of those things.
 

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:21.483
When you think about Malthus
getting into these discussions

00:32:21.483 --> 00:32:24.778
that the strict formulation of
his ideas,

00:32:24.778 --> 00:32:29.122
that we can't make any economic
progress and disaster is

00:32:29.122 --> 00:32:32.430
imminent,
that's clearly not the case,

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:36.980
but if you just slightly
rephrase his questions and ask

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:41.868
not whether you have a dead stop
to population growth--

00:32:41.868 --> 00:32:45.536
to economic growth--but that in
those countries and those places

00:32:45.536 --> 00:32:50.260
with very dense populations,
even though economic growth is

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:54.068
present there,
would the people be better off

00:32:54.068 --> 00:32:56.019
with a lesser population?
 

00:32:56.019 --> 00:33:00.894
Is Malthus right not in the
extreme but in the reality that

00:33:00.894 --> 00:33:02.851
you can--
even in very dense

00:33:02.851 --> 00:33:05.660
populations--you can have some
economic growth,

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.990
but would the people be better
off if they had less--

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:12.608
a lower population?
 

00:33:12.608 --> 00:33:19.230
Then instead of asking whether
food is your limiting factor,

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:23.518
asking whether the environment
is your limiting factor and

00:33:23.518 --> 00:33:27.640
that--
with those rather small changes

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:34.910
in what he said makes Malthus as
relevant today as at any time.

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:46.075
Let's look at some of the
things that I've been talking

00:33:46.075 --> 00:33:47.730
about.
 

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:52.699
You've all seen--you've seen
this graph before and you

00:33:52.699 --> 00:33:58.420
remember this is for Roman times
but characteristic up to--

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:01.170
from way, way back almost into
the 1700s.

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:05.490
that 1,000 females are born,
not very different for males,

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:09.210
most of them die--about half of
them die as infants,

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:12.364
then childbirth and they keep
dying and eventually there's

00:34:12.364 --> 00:34:13.250
very few left.
 

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:18.057
This is the number that are
born and the number that are

00:34:18.057 --> 00:34:18.670
left.
 

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:22.155
The reason I show this again is
because there's one number here

00:34:22.155 --> 00:34:25.010
that I didn't describe before,
but is one way of

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:27.309
characterizing this
E_0 is--

00:34:27.309 --> 00:34:31.360
E is for the expectancy of
life, how long you're going to

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.110
live at age 0,
at your birth.

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:37.880
When a child is born how long
do you expect them to live?

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:42.280
Of course that may be say 70
years old nowadays.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.436
My mother, for instance,
is 97 and so her life

00:34:45.436 --> 00:34:49.773
expectancy is like 102,
so the life expectancy depends

00:34:49.773 --> 00:34:54.802
on when you're measuring it and
so this is life expectancy at

00:34:54.802 --> 00:34:59.829
birth and at this time it was
just under 21 years of age.

00:34:59.829 --> 00:35:05.278
We've see here that when the
death rate is such as to have

00:35:05.278 --> 00:35:10.273
this kind of a life expectancy,
that something like a third of

00:35:10.273 --> 00:35:13.583
the women are doing all the
reproducing because the others

00:35:13.583 --> 00:35:15.994
are dead,
and if it's a third they have

00:35:15.994 --> 00:35:18.960
to have six children to keep the
population going,

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.380
but since a lot of that third
is infertile or sick,

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:28.199
or unmarried or whatever,
the average has to be six--

00:35:28.199 --> 00:35:31.753
the women who actually can
reproduce have to produce a lot

00:35:31.753 --> 00:35:32.190
more.
 

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:36.130
It turns out that that's about
the limit.

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:42.530
That much--with an expectancy
of life of much less than that,

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:46.300
much less than 20 or even maybe
get it down to 20,

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:51.500
your group, your population
goes extinct.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:55.601
Think mathematically just a
little bit that if the average

00:35:55.601 --> 00:35:59.920
lifespan is 20 years then in
every one of those 20 years,

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:04.838
an equal number every year,
1/20^(th) of the population is

00:36:04.838 --> 00:36:07.860
going to die and 1/20^(th) is
5%.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:16.219
You can think of a 5% death
rate as sort of the maximum.

00:36:16.219 --> 00:36:20.548
5% of the population dies every
year is kind of a maximum that

00:36:20.548 --> 00:36:22.039
humans can sustain.
 

00:36:22.039 --> 00:36:25.699
More than that and you have a
lower E_0;

00:36:25.699 --> 00:36:32.210
your population goes out of
existence.

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:35.059
As time goes on,
I've shown you this slide also,

00:36:35.059 --> 00:36:39.909
conditions get a little better
so here is the way this graph--

00:36:39.909 --> 00:36:43.409
this is rather stylized,
we don't have great data to

00:36:43.409 --> 00:36:46.052
make such a graph,
but this shows the life

00:36:46.052 --> 00:36:47.989
expectancy between 20 and 25
years,

00:36:47.989 --> 00:36:52.771
which we think is more or less
the characteristic of humans for

00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:55.445
a long time,
and then very slowly over

00:36:55.445 --> 00:36:57.630
thousands of years it gets
better,

00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:01.210
and up here you're maybe at 25.
 

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:04.809
At 20--at 25 years,
so 25 years--if people are

00:37:04.809 --> 00:37:09.289
going to live on average 25
years that means 1/25^(th) of

00:37:09.289 --> 00:37:14.260
them die every year,
1/25^(th) is 4%.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:22.920
When you see a death rate of
4%, which can be expressed as 4

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:28.940
per 100 or 40 per 1,000--did I
say 40%?

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.340
I meant 4%.
 

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:36.648
What has happened over these
thousands of years is that we

00:37:36.648 --> 00:37:40.429
managed to keep 1% more people
alive every year.

00:37:40.429 --> 00:37:44.882
From here we're keeping the
death rate as maybe 5% a year

00:37:44.882 --> 00:37:48.539
and the death rate here is maybe
4% a year,

00:37:48.539 --> 00:37:53.550
so keep those numbers in mind
as a primitive kind of minimum

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:57.489
using say the 25,
that 40 per 1,000 deaths and

00:37:57.489 --> 00:38:01.170
the population is going to be
fairly stable,

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:03.960
so 40 per 1,000 people.
 

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:12.670
That's what was going on
through most of human history.

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:16.179
Now if you look at the actual
numbers for Europe,

00:38:16.179 --> 00:38:25.333
you see that Eastern Europe has
a--this is the death rate of not

00:38:25.333 --> 00:38:30.710
40 per 1,000 but 38 per 1,000
here.

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:35.143
Very, very little bit better
than the rate at which you

00:38:35.143 --> 00:38:39.250
really can't keep your
population alive anymore.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.514
This continues in Eastern
Europe until 1860,

00:38:42.514 --> 00:38:44.260
until Civil War time.
 

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.610
This is the Civil War in
America.

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:50.010
Russia frees its Serfs at about
this time;

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:53.268
you've got a lot of the great
Russian authors and musicians

00:38:53.268 --> 00:38:55.460
who are starting at around that
time.

00:38:55.460 --> 00:39:01.284
So in Eastern Europe if you
measure standard of living by

00:39:01.284 --> 00:39:05.652
the death rate,
the death rate has improved

00:39:05.652 --> 00:39:12.329
very little over the 40 or 50;
50 is from thousands of years

00:39:12.329 --> 00:39:14.280
ago--then the 40.
 

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:19.710
Then modernization takes over
and it falls very slowly.

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:23.300
Western Europe,
where the enlightenment hit

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:26.096
first,
is doing better at this time,

00:39:26.096 --> 00:39:29.239
and the line is sort of where
Genghis Khan--

00:39:29.239 --> 00:39:30.876
the line between Eastern and
Western Europe was basically

00:39:30.876 --> 00:39:34.489
where Genghis Khan--
the Mongols occupied Europe.

00:39:34.489 --> 00:39:39.855
Here in 1800 Western Europe
already has a death rate down to

00:39:39.855 --> 00:39:40.309
28.
 

00:39:40.309 --> 00:39:43.016
Remember I told you in the
1700s the Western foods come in

00:39:43.016 --> 00:39:46.097
and things start getting better,
so the death rate has been

00:39:46.097 --> 00:39:49.315
dropping at least all during the
1700s and depending on what

00:39:49.315 --> 00:39:53.210
historian you read,
possibly before the 1700s.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:58.963
Eastern Europe 100 years later,
this is 1800 and this is 1890,

00:39:58.963 --> 00:40:03.585
Eastern Europe is 100 years
behind Western Europe,

00:40:03.585 --> 00:40:05.849
more than 100 years.
 

00:40:05.849 --> 00:40:11.260
Europe has already--Western
Europe has progressed somewhat

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:17.239
and at this level the population
is increasing quite rapidly.

00:40:17.239 --> 00:40:22.630
During this period,
again population is increasing,

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:25.230
resources and production are
increasing somewhat,

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:30.570
but the balance is not in favor
of standard of living.

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:35.130
For instance food.
 

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:37.170
Grain accounts for,
during this period,

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:40.300
about 80% of the calories of
the poor and even for the upper

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.228
classes who had more meat,
and eggs, and this kind of

00:40:43.228 --> 00:40:44.510
stuff it was about 50%.
 

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:49.416
You can look basically at grain
prices and wages and grain

00:40:49.416 --> 00:40:53.289
prices and tell how the people
were living.

00:40:53.289 --> 00:40:56.534
In Strasburg,
which is very favorably

00:40:56.534 --> 00:41:00.987
situated on land on the Rhine,
just on the border between

00:41:00.987 --> 00:41:04.056
Germany and France,
sometimes it's Germany and

00:41:04.056 --> 00:41:07.123
sometimes it's France,
between 1400 and 1500 for

00:41:07.123 --> 00:41:09.960
instance,
the amount of work needed to

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:14.625
purchase a month's worth of
wheat was in the range of 60 to

00:41:14.625 --> 00:41:15.590
80 hours.
 

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:20.219
This is just before the
Reformation for instance,

00:41:20.219 --> 00:41:21.860
60 to 80 hours.
 

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:25.179
By 1540, populations were
already increasing,

00:41:25.179 --> 00:41:27.920
it had risen to over 100 hours
and it doesn't--

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:32.873
and then it keeps going and it
doesn't come back down to 100

00:41:32.873 --> 00:41:34.889
hours until the 1880s.
 

00:41:34.889 --> 00:41:39.291
We're talking very;
very late the people are not

00:41:39.291 --> 00:41:41.179
living better.
 

00:41:41.179 --> 00:41:44.409
The wages of German workers,
again measured in grain,

00:41:44.409 --> 00:41:47.630
because prices go up and down,
but how much grain can you buy

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:49.940
whether you work is the
important number.

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:54.420
It fell roughly 50% between
1500 and 1650.

00:41:54.420 --> 00:42:00.248
The percentage of males in
Frankfurt in Germany with enough

00:42:00.248 --> 00:42:06.579
property to be citizens fell
from 75% in 1723 to 33% in 1811.

00:42:06.579 --> 00:42:10.590
We're watching the population
get impoverished.

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:13.706
Massive unemployment in Germany
caused wages to fall below

00:42:13.706 --> 00:42:17.012
subsistence levels,
especially in the 1840s,

00:42:17.012 --> 00:42:22.353
and living standards in Germany
showed no signs of improvement

00:42:22.353 --> 00:42:25.070
before 1850 at the earliest.
 

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:29.320
We're talking very modern
times, well into the industrial

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:33.798
revolution, and things are not
getting better if you look at

00:42:33.798 --> 00:42:35.469
per capita income.
 

00:42:35.469 --> 00:42:39.414
Again, population is growing,
the total national economy is

00:42:39.414 --> 00:42:42.610
growing, but per capita you're
not improving.

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:46.907
In England, buying power
started falling in the 1500s and

00:42:46.907 --> 00:42:51.358
didn't recover to that level
until well into the nineteenth

00:42:51.358 --> 00:42:52.280
century.
 

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:57.625
In Paris, bread consumption did
not increase per capita,

00:42:57.625 --> 00:43:01.610
did not increase between 1637
and 1854.

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:05.063
Pastureland didn't increase,
so the same amount of meat

00:43:05.063 --> 00:43:08.835
basically was produced with some
improvement because of some

00:43:08.835 --> 00:43:12.713
cattle breeding,
but now it was divided among

00:43:12.713 --> 00:43:14.969
more people,
and not only that,

00:43:14.969 --> 00:43:18.264
but because potatoes had come
in and potatoes could keep more

00:43:18.264 --> 00:43:21.724
people alive,
a lot of pastureland was taken

00:43:21.724 --> 00:43:26.773
away from pastureland and put
into potatoes so basically meat

00:43:26.773 --> 00:43:30.139
became very scarce in European
diets.

00:43:30.139 --> 00:43:34.045
Again, it decreased between the
Middle Ages and 1800,

00:43:34.045 --> 00:43:36.300
it doesn't start recovering.
 

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:39.442
Forests did not increase,
in fact were cut down to have

00:43:39.442 --> 00:43:42.697
more land for agriculture,
so wood becomes scarce for

00:43:42.697 --> 00:43:44.217
housing,
for heating,

00:43:44.217 --> 00:43:47.661
for heating houses,
for building houses and so

00:43:47.661 --> 00:43:48.349
forth.
 

00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:54.539
What happened during this
period is that people--

00:43:54.539 --> 00:43:57.693
standard of living was going
down, they managed to stay

00:43:57.693 --> 00:43:59.277
alive,
they had to work harder and

00:43:59.277 --> 00:44:02.278
harder,
the hours that they worked to

00:44:02.278 --> 00:44:07.394
get--to maintain themselves
alive kept increasing and yet

00:44:07.394 --> 00:44:10.409
they didn't make any progress.
 

00:44:10.409 --> 00:44:14.393
We're talking about ballpark
100 years into the industrial

00:44:14.393 --> 00:44:17.039
revolution which we now--
that's what you learned in high

00:44:17.039 --> 00:44:18.922
school,
the industrial revolution is

00:44:18.922 --> 00:44:22.485
such a wonderful thing and it
improved incomes and the modern

00:44:22.485 --> 00:44:24.980
world during the industrial
revolution.

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:27.853
But in actual fact the data
shows that's really not the

00:44:27.853 --> 00:44:30.032
case,
that for about 100 years the

00:44:30.032 --> 00:44:33.599
industrial revolution while
making tremendous progress and

00:44:33.599 --> 00:44:36.730
total national economies are
growing very big,

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:40.538
the per capita income of all
but the very upper classes

00:44:40.538 --> 00:44:42.090
doesn't really grow.
 

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:46.275
By this time of course Malthus
is dead and we know he's been

00:44:46.275 --> 00:44:50.389
laughing in his grave because he
was very controversial.

00:44:50.389 --> 00:44:53.802
When he was alive he was very
controversial and it really

00:44:53.802 --> 00:44:56.239
wasn't until the Irish potato
famine,

00:44:56.239 --> 00:45:00.329
about which you have read,
and massive numbers of people

00:45:00.329 --> 00:45:06.289
died for lack of resources,
a bug killing the potatoes.

00:45:06.289 --> 00:45:09.092
Then people said,
'oh yeah Malthus was right,'

00:45:09.092 --> 00:45:10.650
and then it kept going.
 

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:15.320
His idea that progress could
just be eaten up by population

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:19.590
growth turns out to be
characteristic of many hundreds

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:24.501
of years of European history and
the rest of the world also of

00:45:24.501 --> 00:45:25.550
course.
 

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:30.947
Now an amazing thing happens in
this to start changing the story

00:45:30.947 --> 00:45:33.260
and it happens in France.
 

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:34.429
What happens?
 

00:45:34.429 --> 00:45:39.335
The French, which looked up
until about 1800,1750 or so,

00:45:39.335 --> 00:45:43.349
looked like any other
population in Europe.

00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:46.614
They had lots and lots of
children, but then they stopped

00:45:46.614 --> 00:45:48.190
having a lot of children.
 

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:51.130
It just came out of the blue,
and what changed?

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:55.007
The age of marriage didn't
change a lot so that wasn't the

00:45:55.007 --> 00:45:55.960
cause of it.
 

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.663
The age at first birth didn't
change a lot,

00:45:58.663 --> 00:46:02.074
they weren't getting married
then delaying childbirth,

00:46:02.074 --> 00:46:04.070
that stayed about the same.
 

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:09.268
The interval between babies
didn't change very much so they

00:46:09.268 --> 00:46:14.380
were not using much control
within marriage apparently.

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:18.190
Once they got married they just
started popping out babies.

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:22.219
But, they stopped having
children at a young age.

00:46:22.219 --> 00:46:26.512
The age of--the age at first
birth doesn't change much,

00:46:26.512 --> 00:46:30.090
the age at last birth changes
by ten years.

00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:35.168
Families stop having children
about ten years earlier,

00:46:35.168 --> 00:46:40.920
chopping out a very large
fraction of their fertile years.

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:44.539
This behavior is called
"stopping behavior"

00:46:44.539 --> 00:46:47.880
and we see it all around the
world eventually.

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.239
No one understood what was
going on but they were

00:46:50.239 --> 00:46:52.139
horrified,
they knew it was happening,

00:46:52.139 --> 00:46:54.610
it was--
people were well aware of it

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:57.320
and they were quite horrified by
it.

00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:00.755
Any of you that watch
television know that John Adams

00:47:00.755 --> 00:47:04.389
and his wife Abigail went to
Europe about that time,

00:47:04.389 --> 00:47:07.331
I think it was 1782,
and she especially was

00:47:07.331 --> 00:47:11.253
distressed at the French
people's "feeble commitment

00:47:11.253 --> 00:47:14.474
to family life,"
exemplified by the French

00:47:14.474 --> 00:47:18.536
families only having three or
four children rather than the

00:47:18.536 --> 00:47:22.179
eight or ten that you were
supposed to have.

00:47:22.179 --> 00:47:25.820
Americans at the time were
having eight or nine.

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:28.429
They were equally
horrified--this is again from

00:47:28.429 --> 00:47:31.719
the Adams', they were equally
horrified by the French upper

00:47:31.719 --> 00:47:33.989
classes easy acceptance of
adultery.

00:47:33.989 --> 00:47:36.800
This they found was,
and this is John Adams

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:40.815
speaking, "an indication of
the general moral and social

00:47:40.815 --> 00:47:42.489
disintegration."
 

00:47:42.489 --> 00:47:48.710
He said, "The French are
not a moral people."

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:51.614
What happens is all this
behavior which was wildly

00:47:51.614 --> 00:47:55.416
decried by everyone,
within a century after France

00:47:55.416 --> 00:47:59.585
starts doing it,
all of Europe takes off and

00:47:59.585 --> 00:48:02.440
starts doing the same thing.
 

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:09.250
Here is a graph of that.
 

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:11.840
This graph starts in the year,
and we'll talk about it later,

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:15.840
where fertility has already
dropped by about 10% and here's

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:20.347
France and this states that--
when the fertility change has

00:48:20.347 --> 00:48:23.369
already been going on to the
1820s,

00:48:23.369 --> 00:48:25.969
when it's actually started
before that,

00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:29.583
and then every other country in
Europe starts dropping its

00:48:29.583 --> 00:48:31.550
fertility within this period.
 

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:36.842
It goes down by--in this space
of time--by 30%,

00:48:36.842 --> 00:48:39.260
an enormous change.
 

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:46.610
Even though France starts it
early and everybody's horrified

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:52.590
by it, in fact,
everybody starts copying this.

00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:56.690
This is Europe but in another
century, Asia,

00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:59.840
and Latin America--follow suit.
 

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:05.650
This is really a major change
in what it means and how one

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:08.710
lives life as a human being.
 

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:12.021
I've stressed the biology of
reproduction,

00:49:12.021 --> 00:49:16.708
of course we have a biological
drive to keep having sex and

00:49:16.708 --> 00:49:18.889
that produces children.
 

00:49:18.889 --> 00:49:23.471
The culture or the cultural
religion presses upon people to

00:49:23.471 --> 00:49:28.132
keep their birth rates up and
this goes on for thousands and

00:49:28.132 --> 00:49:33.030
thousands of years of human
history until the late 1800s,

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:38.445
early for France and then all
of a sudden all around Europe

00:49:38.445 --> 00:49:44.329
and then later in the world this
very fundamental way of being a

00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:46.010
human changes.
 

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:50.070
The big question in demography,
since this was noticed a long

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:52.440
time ago, what cause this
change?

00:49:52.440 --> 00:50:01.360
Why did all of a sudden with
no--why did this all happen?

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.860
The people at the time were
absolutely dumbfounded,

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:07.130
and dumbfounded especially that
it should happen in France,

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:10.150
because at that time France was
at the height of its power,

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:12.800
it was about the richest
country in Europe,

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:16.253
it was the most powerful,
it was the most advanced in

00:50:16.253 --> 00:50:18.346
learning,
all the Philosophes were there,

00:50:18.346 --> 00:50:21.690
the encyclopedia was there,
it was the top of the world.

00:50:21.690 --> 00:50:28.422
Why should, of all places on
earth, the richest people on

00:50:28.422 --> 00:50:32.030
earth--stop having children?
 

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:34.510
Now--it wasn't important at
that time,

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:35.730
it wasn't considered to be
important,

00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:39.782
but of course France is a
totally Catholic country and so

00:50:39.782 --> 00:50:44.269
why should a Catholic country be
the first one and way ahead of

00:50:44.269 --> 00:50:47.309
everyone else to reduce its
birthrate?

00:50:47.309 --> 00:50:50.605
Historians have come up with
all--we don't know the answer,

00:50:50.605 --> 00:50:52.480
let me tell you that right out.
 

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:56.309
But, historians do have lots of
answer for it.

00:50:56.309 --> 00:51:01.074
One--the reasons for the French
fertility decline lie in the

00:51:01.074 --> 00:51:05.032
moral and religious
reassessments that occurred in

00:51:05.032 --> 00:51:09.070
the tumultuous years of the
French Revolution.

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:15.610
For sure, a moral realignment
was certainly taking place.

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:19.730
How many of you know Madame
Bovary, the novel?

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:25.650
What's the novel--what's the
centerpiece of the novel?

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:28.610
It's an adulterous affair,
right?

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:30.856
Here's a woman,
a young married woman,

00:51:30.856 --> 00:51:33.284
has a child,
and she has a perfectly nice

00:51:33.284 --> 00:51:36.380
husband who adores her and is
quite permissive.

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:40.148
She really has nothing
objective to complain about,

00:51:40.148 --> 00:51:44.367
but she considers him boring
and so she takes an exciting

00:51:44.367 --> 00:51:46.780
lover or a series of lovers.
 

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:50.842
I'm not going to give away the
plot but the book was taken as a

00:51:50.842 --> 00:51:53.989
justification for having
extramarital affairs.

00:51:53.989 --> 00:51:57.099
Now that's okay for men and has
been okay for men,

00:51:57.099 --> 00:52:00.833
but here's a woman,
here's Flaubert justifying a

00:52:00.833 --> 00:52:04.090
woman's having an extramarital
affair,

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:06.150
not because the husband was
beating her or anything,

00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:08.349
he was a perfectly decent guy.
 

00:52:08.349 --> 00:52:12.798
That was considered terrible
and he was promptly arrested and

00:52:12.798 --> 00:52:17.099
prosecuted by the government for
"affronting religious

00:52:17.099 --> 00:52:18.510
morality."
 

00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:22.907
Of course that was very good
for sales of the book,

00:52:22.907 --> 00:52:28.007
so everybody read that book,
including a lot of us still at

00:52:28.007 --> 00:52:28.800
Yale.
 

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:32.175
People were--the rest of Europe
were well aware of the French

00:52:32.175 --> 00:52:35.324
lead in this and in English
speaking countries France was

00:52:35.324 --> 00:52:39.829
blamed for the problem,
and especially French novels,

00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:43.670
and they were corrupting our
people,

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:46.469
they were fomenting
extramarital liaisons,

00:52:46.469 --> 00:52:51.090
and by implication the use of
contraception.

00:52:51.090 --> 00:52:55.697
This spreads very rapidly so
who knows the plot of Anna

00:52:55.697 --> 00:52:56.909
Karenina?
 

00:52:56.909 --> 00:53:01.231
An adulterous affair,
and again, her husband wasn't

00:53:01.231 --> 00:53:03.480
quite as nice as Bovary.
 

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:06.280
He was kind of a stiff guy but
he wasn't beating her;

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:10.606
he wasn't really a bad guy,
she goes off and has a wild

00:53:10.606 --> 00:53:12.762
affair and that--
War and Peace and

00:53:12.762 --> 00:53:14.344
Anna Karenina,
and The Brothers

00:53:14.344 --> 00:53:17.268
Karmazov, one of the three
greatest Russian novels,

00:53:17.268 --> 00:53:23.349
are exactly on this same mode
of Flaubert and they're all

00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:29.427
really talking about this whole
change in attitude toward

00:53:29.427 --> 00:53:36.809
fertility and sexuality that was
overcoming Europe at this time.

00:53:36.809 --> 00:53:39.809
Much later, not that much
later, after the European

00:53:39.809 --> 00:53:43.349
fertility transition was over,
which only lasted until about

00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.889
1930.
 

00:53:43.889 --> 00:53:46.710
It starts in 1870,
you'll see these dates,

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:50.867
the fertility drop out--except
for France starts in about 1870

00:53:50.867 --> 00:53:54.753
and is all over by 1930 and
social sciences start thinking

00:53:54.753 --> 00:53:59.320
about this fertility drop but
not in moralistic terms anymore,

00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:04.222
not how it was ruining our
morals, but in terms of sort of

00:54:04.222 --> 00:54:06.630
quantifiable explanations.
 

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:10.257
The major--again asking this,
which is probably the most

00:54:10.257 --> 00:54:13.489
important question in all the
social sciences,

00:54:13.489 --> 00:54:17.340
the most important change in
how it is to be a human,

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:21.610
and what is the cause of this?
 

00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:24.797
They did a very massive project
and we'll have a guest speaker

00:54:24.797 --> 00:54:26.889
who's one of the main people in
this,

00:54:26.889 --> 00:54:30.197
Michael Teitelbaum,
that they set up what they call

00:54:30.197 --> 00:54:33.440
an office of population research
and they did--

00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:36.210
every graduate student got a
different country in Europe,

00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:39.835
and he went into that country
and looked at all the provincial

00:54:39.835 --> 00:54:43.400
records and dug out everything
they could find and they got a

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:46.907
mass of statistics on everything
they could figure out about

00:54:46.907 --> 00:54:51.032
every province in Europe,
and not only Western Europe but

00:54:51.032 --> 00:54:55.550
all the way across Europe into
Russia and so it was the most--

00:54:55.550 --> 00:55:00.402
probably the most massive
social science investigation

00:55:00.402 --> 00:55:02.510
that ever took place.
 

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:09.335
What had come up by that time
already was kind of a schema of

00:55:09.335 --> 00:55:15.480
what's--what we now call the
demographic transition.

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:18.436
I've shown you how the death
rate, there's no particular

00:55:18.436 --> 00:55:20.344
dates,
this is sort of very

00:55:20.344 --> 00:55:24.197
generalized kind of idea,
that the death rate--the first

00:55:24.197 --> 00:55:27.860
thing that happens in time is
that the death rate falls.

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:32.929
Then at some time later the
birth rate falls--

00:55:32.929 --> 00:55:37.309
there's--early on I described
the drop in the death rate and

00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:41.840
now we see that sometime later
the birth rate fall happens.

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:45.119
Well what happens in between is
this population growth.

00:55:45.119 --> 00:55:48.409
In old times the birth rate was
very high and the death rate was

00:55:48.409 --> 00:55:50.443
very high,
but they pretty nearly matched,

00:55:50.443 --> 00:55:52.059
there's a little bit of
difference,

00:55:52.059 --> 00:55:54.719
the population does grow but it
grows very slowly.

00:55:54.719 --> 00:55:57.253
When it's all over,
the birth rate is low and the

00:55:57.253 --> 00:55:59.577
death rate is low,
and again there's a little

00:55:59.577 --> 00:56:00.369
difference.
 

00:56:00.369 --> 00:56:03.407
Population grows slowly,
or nowadays in a lot of Europe

00:56:03.407 --> 00:56:06.445
the birth rate goes below the
death rate and population

00:56:06.445 --> 00:56:10.074
decreases somewhat slowly,
but there's no super rapid

00:56:10.074 --> 00:56:12.898
change here,
there's no big rapid change

00:56:12.898 --> 00:56:16.400
here, but in between the death--
the time when the death rate

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.570
falls and the time when the
birth rate falls--

00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:23.429
all of this is population
growth because the birth rate is

00:56:23.429 --> 00:56:25.389
above the death rate.
 

00:56:25.389 --> 00:56:28.585
This is the period of the
population explosions and the

00:56:28.585 --> 00:56:31.780
first of these population
explosions was in Europe,

00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:34.860
not in the poor countries,
not in the developing world,

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:38.936
but in the richest part of the
world at that time which was

00:56:38.936 --> 00:56:39.570
Europe.
 

00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:44.840
The same schema is supposed to
apply later on.

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:50.561
This is, as an empirical
generalization …

00:56:50.561 --> 00:56:55.309
medium--that some countries fit
this.

00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:58.887
Nobody is terribly far from
this, the birth rate and the

00:56:58.887 --> 00:57:03.050
death rate always go down in
some relationship to each other,

00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:06.768
but the question which arises
is, is the correlation good

00:57:06.768 --> 00:57:09.360
enough that the death rate
actually--

00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:13.639
the drop in the death rate
actually causes the drop in the

00:57:13.639 --> 00:57:17.114
birth rate,
and the theory runs in a rather

00:57:17.114 --> 00:57:20.322
obvious way,
that parents know how many

00:57:20.322 --> 00:57:21.949
children they want.
 

00:57:21.949 --> 00:57:24.849
They know roughly how many
children they can keep alive,

00:57:24.849 --> 00:57:27.389
how much farmland they have to
give them to inherit,

00:57:27.389 --> 00:57:33.518
how many they need to take care
of them in their old age.

00:57:33.518 --> 00:57:38.123
When the death rate is very
high, and not only high but very

00:57:38.123 --> 00:57:40.465
variable--
I showed you last time in

00:57:40.465 --> 00:57:42.829
Sweden the death rate going up
and down,

00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:45.829
when the death rate is high and
variable you don't know--

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:49.344
if you have a lot of children
you don't how many are going to

00:57:49.344 --> 00:57:49.929
survive.
 

00:57:49.929 --> 00:57:52.585
You need not only as many
children as you want,

00:57:52.585 --> 00:57:55.702
and taking into account the
death rate, but taking into

00:57:55.702 --> 00:57:58.360
account the variability of the
death rate.

00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:02.199
What if an epidemic comes
through when my kids are young?

00:58:02.199 --> 00:58:06.885
So you have to have a lot of
children in order to insure that

00:58:06.885 --> 00:58:11.179
in your old age you'll have some
to take care of you.

00:58:11.179 --> 00:58:14.659
As the death rate falls people
gradually really--

00:58:14.659 --> 00:58:17.911
the theory is that people
gradually realize this and they

00:58:17.911 --> 00:58:21.454
reduce their fertility because
they don't need to bear so many

00:58:21.454 --> 00:58:24.940
children in order to have so
many left at the end because the

00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:27.992
children--
they start getting confidence

00:58:27.992 --> 00:58:30.920
that the children are not going
to die.

00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:34.826
This is a lovely theory and how
many of you have heard that,

00:58:34.826 --> 00:58:36.349
some version of that?
 

00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:39.192
It's one of--you'll see there's
about ten standard

00:58:39.192 --> 00:58:41.744
versions--theories about why
fertility falls,

00:58:41.744 --> 00:58:43.079
this is number one.
 

00:58:43.079 --> 00:58:47.755
That it's the fall in the death
rate causes the fall in the

00:58:47.755 --> 00:58:52.512
birth rate, so now we're going
to--this is--look and see how

00:58:52.512 --> 00:58:54.610
accurate that this is.
 

00:58:54.610 --> 00:59:02.909
This is Norway actually,
and here is the death rate--

00:59:02.909 --> 00:59:08.802
this black line for Norway--and
it starts falling from about

00:59:08.802 --> 00:59:13.434
middle of the 1700s,
and pretty continuous fall

00:59:13.434 --> 00:59:15.409
during all this time.
 

00:59:15.409 --> 00:59:21.552
Here is the birth rate,
pretty constant across here and

00:59:21.552 --> 00:59:27.239
then it finally starts falling
in 1900 I think,

00:59:27.239 --> 00:59:31.331
so there's a long time period
between when the birth rate

00:59:31.331 --> 00:59:34.360
starts falling and--
sorry when the death rate

00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:37.489
starts falling and when the
birth rate starts falling.

00:59:37.489 --> 00:59:40.940
The difference between those
rates is this line here that all

00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:44.688
of this is population growth,
and in this period here where

00:59:44.688 --> 00:59:48.637
the death rate is quite a ways
down but the birth rate hasn't

00:59:48.637 --> 00:59:53.465
responded very much yet,
the Norwegian population grows

00:59:53.465 --> 00:59:55.059
by this amount.
 

00:59:55.059 --> 00:59:57.530
That's standard,
that's the way it's supposed to

00:59:57.530 --> 00:59:57.900
work.
 

00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:03.480
That's the way the schema shows
it working.

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:08.094
Now you look at England,
England and Wales,

01:00:08.094 --> 01:00:11.719
and you don't get this picture.
 

01:00:11.719 --> 01:00:14.175
Here is fertility,
the gray thing,

01:00:14.175 --> 01:00:18.268
and fertility starts dropping
as I said around 1870,

01:00:18.268 --> 01:00:21.190
maybe 18--this shows it a
little bit after 1875 or so,

01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:25.349
and then it drops rather
continuously.

01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:26.739
This is fertility.
 

01:00:26.739 --> 01:00:29.166
Infant mortality,
which is a good measure of

01:00:29.166 --> 01:00:31.666
total mortality,
doesn't really start dropping,

01:00:31.666 --> 01:00:34.119
it's pretty constant,
ups and downs,

01:00:34.119 --> 01:00:39.652
until 1905 or something like
that and it only starts going

01:00:39.652 --> 01:00:40.429
down.
 

01:00:40.429 --> 01:00:45.356
Here it's the reverse situation
that now you have fertility

01:00:45.356 --> 01:00:49.179
falling first and mortality
falling later,

01:00:49.179 --> 01:00:51.670
and you can make a causal
explanation for this,

01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:55.440
that when people are having
lots and lots of kids they can't

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.719
take care of them.
 

01:00:56.719 --> 01:00:58.927
They don't have enough food,
they don't have enough this,

01:00:58.927 --> 01:01:01.016
that and the other thing,
so there's a very high death

01:01:01.016 --> 01:01:02.119
rate among the children.
 

01:01:02.119 --> 01:01:06.742
If you drop your fertility you
have more resources for each

01:01:06.742 --> 01:01:07.380
child.
 

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:13.914
And that's actually as
compelling an explanation--in

01:01:13.914 --> 01:01:20.320
the absence of data--as the
reverse explanation.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.831
If you look across many,
many countries which the

01:01:23.831 --> 01:01:29.724
Princeton project did,
this is the drop in the

01:01:29.724 --> 01:01:34.731
mortality rate,
this graph, and this is the

01:01:34.731 --> 01:01:36.809
drop in the fertility rate.
 

01:01:36.809 --> 01:01:40.860
This is the years,
same year starts in 1825,

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:44.039
this is 1975,
so this is the period when the

01:01:44.039 --> 01:01:48.253
change was happening and for
fertility here this period is

01:01:48.253 --> 01:01:52.983
when birth rate has already come
down by about 10% and you'll see

01:01:52.983 --> 01:01:57.657
that's some kind of threshold,
and when it's down then

01:01:57.657 --> 01:02:02.715
something like 30% I think it
ends and mortality has also its

01:02:02.715 --> 01:02:03.559
limits.
 

01:02:03.559 --> 01:02:06.264
This is the period when
mortality is falling in Norway

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:09.429
and Denmark, and Sweden and
England, and Wales and so forth.

01:02:09.429 --> 01:02:12.219
All you have to do is look at
the order of these things.

01:02:12.219 --> 01:02:15.530
As I've shown you for
fertility, France is the first

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:20.059
one by a long shot it starts--
they put it in the early 1800s,

01:02:20.059 --> 01:02:24.719
it's down by 10% already and
it's all over by 1900 or so,

01:02:24.719 --> 01:02:26.989
France way ahead in time of
anybody else.

01:02:26.989 --> 01:02:29.621
Now you look at the mortality
and you say well where is

01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:30.059
France?
 

01:02:30.059 --> 01:02:32.675
It's not Norway,
it's not Denmark,

01:02:32.675 --> 01:02:35.449
it's not Sweden,
where is France?

01:02:35.449 --> 01:02:38.829
Do I even see France here?
 

01:02:38.829 --> 01:02:40.789
There it is.
 

01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:43.559
Its way in the middle of the
pack, that doesn't fit the

01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:45.510
theory and if you go the other
way,

01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:49.195
Norway is the first one to drop
its mortality rate and where is

01:02:49.195 --> 01:02:51.309
Norway,
more or less in the middle of

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:53.250
the pack when you look at
fertility.

01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:56.670
These two things don't
correlate as nicely.

01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:58.630
Again, this is the Princeton
project;

01:02:58.630 --> 01:03:05.659
don't correlate as nicely as
the theory would have us do.

01:03:05.659 --> 01:03:08.461
The end result of all these
graduate students studying the

01:03:08.461 --> 01:03:10.969
relationship between mortality
and fertility was?

01:03:10.969 --> 01:03:15.632
We don't know what's going on
because we saw everything under

01:03:15.632 --> 01:03:16.409
the sun.
 

01:03:16.409 --> 01:03:21.018
There's no very strong
correlation.

01:03:21.018 --> 01:03:26.123
They were very smart and they
tried all kinds of things and

01:03:26.123 --> 01:03:31.050
another way you can look at it
is to see at what level of

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:34.244
mortality,
maybe looking at years is not

01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:37.090
the right thing but the level of
mortality.

01:03:37.090 --> 01:03:42.137
They looked at infant mortality
levels at the time when the

01:03:42.137 --> 01:03:43.880
fertility dropped.
 

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:47.273
What you have is,
in France, the infant mortality

01:03:47.273 --> 01:03:49.833
was still very high;
just infants it's not total

01:03:49.833 --> 01:03:53.773
mortality just infant mortality,
almost 300 here when France

01:03:53.773 --> 01:03:58.329
starts dropping its fertility
sometime this--

01:03:58.329 --> 01:04:01.670
puts it somewhere in the late
1700s.

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:05.646
The fertility started dropping
and the infant mortality was

01:04:05.646 --> 01:04:06.880
still very high.
 

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:09.672
Then you can go around the
world all different kinds of

01:04:09.672 --> 01:04:12.202
places,
Japan 160, Norway 100,

01:04:12.202 --> 01:04:17.693
that there doesn't seem to be
any kind of commonality here in

01:04:17.693 --> 01:04:22.452
what the infant mortality
actually was when fertility

01:04:22.452 --> 01:04:23.460
drops.
 

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:28.030
Remember the 400 is sort of the
primitive level,

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:33.373
and actually when you go into
Asia you can see that in places

01:04:33.373 --> 01:04:38.445
like Taiwan and Mexico--
Mexico doesn't--that moved from

01:04:38.445 --> 01:04:38.980
Asia.
 

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:43.880
In Mexico and Taiwan the
mortality was 35 ,

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:50.157
so very close to the primitive
level where you can just keep

01:04:50.157 --> 01:04:56.010
your society going and yet
fertility starts dropping.

01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:57.809
Basically you see the whole
range.

01:04:57.809 --> 01:05:01.286
The whole range is something
like 35 or 40 and you don't keep

01:05:01.286 --> 01:05:03.429
your society alive less than
that,

01:05:03.429 --> 01:05:07.293
and modern Japan would be at
this time be about 5 and you see

01:05:07.293 --> 01:05:09.347
that--
the range is what you actually

01:05:09.347 --> 01:05:13.159
see is this whole range,
anywhere in that range of what

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:18.038
mortality levels people actually
achieve can be the range at

01:05:18.038 --> 01:05:20.849
which fertility starts to fall.
 

01:05:20.849 --> 01:05:25.710
There's no real conclusion
possible.

01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:30.619
What's explanation number two
that you all have heard?

01:05:30.619 --> 01:05:34.409
Economic development,
how many have heard that

01:05:34.409 --> 01:05:35.590
explanation?
 

01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:37.681
Not so many,
that's very standard,

01:05:37.681 --> 01:05:40.764
the whole Reagan--
the whole Reagan policy

01:05:40.764 --> 01:05:44.159
was--and for a lot of the world
was that--

01:05:44.159 --> 01:05:46.860
forget about family planning
and pushing that,

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:52.184
that economic development is
what reduces fertility so that's

01:05:52.184 --> 01:05:57.597
a very good theory also and we
can look at it and wow the data

01:05:57.597 --> 01:05:59.550
looks pretty good.
 

01:05:59.550 --> 01:06:05.135
Down here is per capita income
and each of these is a separate

01:06:05.135 --> 01:06:09.166
country here,
for every country as per capita

01:06:09.166 --> 01:06:12.829
income goes up fertility comes
down.

01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:16.172
It can come down a fairly
straight line,

01:06:16.172 --> 01:06:21.146
or it can do some wiggles and
jiggles, but basically as per

01:06:21.146 --> 01:06:25.090
capita income goes up fertility
goes down.

01:06:25.090 --> 01:06:27.250
You like that theory?
 

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:29.730
There's some problems with it.
 

01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:33.702
How much money does it take to
keep people out of bed

01:06:33.702 --> 01:06:34.619
basically?
 

01:06:34.619 --> 01:06:40.610
Well, the French start dropping
their fertility when their per

01:06:40.610 --> 01:06:44.440
capita income is something like
180--

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:50.800
this is in--converted basically
to dollars $180 a year,

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:53.682
50 cents a day,
back then that was more money

01:06:53.682 --> 01:06:57.438
than now,
it keeps the Frenchmen out of

01:06:57.438 --> 01:06:57.949
bed.
 

01:06:57.949 --> 01:07:01.335
Now anybody of Italian
extraction will be very proud to

01:07:01.335 --> 01:07:04.094
realize that it takes Italians
twice as much,

01:07:04.094 --> 01:07:06.980
$360 or something to keep them
out of bed.

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:10.588
We have now scientifically and
quantitatively proven that

01:07:10.588 --> 01:07:13.940
Italians are definitely sexier
then French people.

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:16.978
Then you go along,
here's the Germans a little bit

01:07:16.978 --> 01:07:19.717
stolid here,
and of course who--we are at

01:07:19.717 --> 01:07:23.527
exactly the opposite of what we
presume that the English are

01:07:23.527 --> 01:07:27.530
supposed to be so straight that
they don't do it at all and yet

01:07:27.530 --> 01:07:31.469
in order to keep the British out
of bed you have to really pay

01:07:31.469 --> 01:07:32.889
them awful lot.
 

01:07:32.889 --> 01:07:37.472
They have to be somewhere in
the--between $700 and $800

01:07:37.472 --> 01:07:39.170
dollars in income.
 

01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:44.574
There doesn't seem to be any
particular number of income that

01:07:44.574 --> 01:07:49.168
has a huge range that is
required before people drop

01:07:49.168 --> 01:07:50.969
their fertility.
 

01:07:50.969 --> 01:07:55.204
When you think about it a
little more this whole way of

01:07:55.204 --> 01:07:59.438
looking at it is not very
convincing because here's per

01:07:59.438 --> 01:08:02.460
capita income,
but we're talking about the

01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:06.030
time of industrialization and
after fertility starts dropping.

01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:08.992
So once fertility starts
dropping per capita income does

01:08:08.992 --> 01:08:09.800
start rising.
 

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:12.516
That's sort of the most
important take home message for

01:08:12.516 --> 01:08:15.818
today,
so I'll say it before time runs

01:08:15.818 --> 01:08:18.409
out,
that the industrial revolution

01:08:18.409 --> 01:08:22.219
by itself didn't really improve
the standard of living of

01:08:22.219 --> 01:08:22.899
people.
 

01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:26.167
Up until about 1870 there was
tremendous increase in

01:08:26.167 --> 01:08:28.408
productivity,
tremendous increase in

01:08:28.408 --> 01:08:29.368
population.
 

01:08:29.368 --> 01:08:32.966
They cancelled each other out
and for the average working

01:08:32.966 --> 01:08:35.920
person the standard of living
does not rise.

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:39.927
Starting roughly 1870,
people dropped their fertility

01:08:39.927 --> 01:08:44.475
rates and the standard of living
starts rising and we see it

01:08:44.475 --> 01:08:47.020
starts rising all along here.
 

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:53.435
If you take any dates from 1870
until today or until a few

01:08:53.435 --> 01:08:57.826
months ago anyway,
per capita income is rising

01:08:57.826 --> 01:09:00.979
everywhere in Europe at
different rates,

01:09:00.979 --> 01:09:03.189
but everywhere in Europe.
 

01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:06.242
Anything is for guessing,
in everything that you can

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:08.875
measure about Europe,
changes in what we call

01:09:08.875 --> 01:09:11.029
monotonic in a single direction.
 

01:09:11.029 --> 01:09:14.630
Education goes up,
urbanization goes up,

01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:17.819
the number of the year goes up,
everything,

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:22.833
women's education goes up,
anything that you can think of

01:09:22.833 --> 01:09:26.060
goes up,
and fertility goes down.

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:30.028
So when you make graphs like
that anything that you put on

01:09:30.028 --> 01:09:31.698
this axis is going up.
 

01:09:31.698 --> 01:09:32.819
This happened to be per capita
income,

01:09:32.819 --> 01:09:35.077
it could be education,
industrialization,

01:09:35.077 --> 01:09:37.560
urbanization,
and fertility is falling during

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:40.409
this period--
so any two variables that you

01:09:40.409 --> 01:09:43.930
put together will give you
similar graph to this and it

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:47.645
tells you absolutely nothing
except the only thing you can

01:09:47.645 --> 01:09:50.712
think of that--
well there is no particular

01:09:50.712 --> 01:09:53.649
level of income which causes
people to drop.

01:09:53.649 --> 01:09:58.255
When you get into the
developing worlds the levels are

01:09:58.255 --> 01:10:02.252
way, way below,
they're out here and they start

01:10:02.252 --> 01:10:05.380
dropping their fertility levels.
 

01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:10.761
They repeated this over and
over again for all kinds of

01:10:10.761 --> 01:10:16.542
hypotheses and they always got
the same kind of answer that

01:10:16.542 --> 01:10:20.529
nothing really correlated very
well.

01:10:20.529 --> 01:10:24.601
Literacy is another answer that
people started getting more

01:10:24.601 --> 01:10:29.082
worldly because they can read,
and fertility began to fall and

01:10:29.082 --> 01:10:32.850
literacy rates were very low in
France and Bulgaria,

01:10:32.850 --> 01:10:36.779
in Hungary but literacy was
already very high in England and

01:10:36.779 --> 01:10:38.908
Wales when its fertility fell.
 

01:10:38.908 --> 01:10:42.377
Urbanization,
the British fertility declined

01:10:42.377 --> 01:10:45.279
when it began in Britain in
1870,

01:10:45.279 --> 01:10:50.029
72% of the British were already
in what are called conurbations,

01:10:50.029 --> 01:10:53.831
in urban settings,
but in France when they started

01:10:53.831 --> 01:10:58.479
100 years earlier,
very, very low level.

01:10:58.479 --> 01:11:02.930
I won't continue this but that
Princeton project was a massive,

01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:06.398
massive study of all the--every
socio economic variable that you

01:11:06.398 --> 01:11:08.296
can think of,
all the theories,

01:11:08.296 --> 01:11:11.525
all the ten theories that you
hear around and from your

01:11:11.525 --> 01:11:15.792
friends and think yourself,
none of them really worked out

01:11:15.792 --> 01:11:20.617
as something you could really
nail to fertility drops because

01:11:20.617 --> 01:11:23.868
of infant mortality drops,
or income goes up,

01:11:23.868 --> 01:11:27.010
or education goes up,
or any of these sorts of things.

01:11:27.010 --> 01:11:30.930
Next time we will continue and
tell you at least what the

01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:34.149
Princeton people thought was the
real cause.

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:06.297
Prof: As you know,
one of the long-term themes in

00:00:06.297 --> 00:00:11.110
our course has been intellectual
history,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:17.050
and the impact of epidemic
diseases on that.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.863
And this morning,
in that light,

00:00:18.863 --> 00:00:22.550
I'm going to be looking at one
of the great medical debates--

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.798
in particular,
a great medical debate of the

00:00:25.798 --> 00:00:30.349
nineteenth century--
which was the so-called debate

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.490
between contagionism and
anticontagionism.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.940
Now, why would we be interested
in it?

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.707
First of all,
if we're going to understand

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:44.668
nineteenth-century medicine,
we have to realize that if you

00:00:44.668 --> 00:00:47.318
were to go back,
say, to reading The

00:00:47.318 --> 00:00:50.861
Lancet, one of the major
medical journals of the

00:00:50.861 --> 00:00:54.609
nineteenth century,
or say the Proceedings of

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:57.450
the French Academy of
Medicine,

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.643
you would see that they
were--one of the leading issues

00:01:01.643 --> 00:01:06.150
that was being hotly debated was
the rights and wrongs,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.000
the scientific evidence for and
against,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.209
the idea of contagionism,
and its opponents,

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:16.319
the idea of anticontagionism.
 

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:20.220
This was really a hot-button
topic in nineteenth century

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.000
medicine.
 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.599
It consumed the middle decades
of the century.

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:29.516
So, if we're going to--if part
of our course is to understand

00:01:29.516 --> 00:01:34.433
what was happening in the world
of medicine, well this debate

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:36.810
was really crucial in it.
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.416
Another part of our interest in
this debate is that it brings to

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:50.211
a conclusion much of our
consideration of Asiatic

00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:51.660
cholera.
 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.994
We've talked about the impact
of cholera, and we need to

00:01:56.994 --> 00:02:02.909
recognize that its impact was
partly in the realm of ideas.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:10.438
Its legacy didn't include just
death, fear, social tension.

00:02:10.438 --> 00:02:15.479
It didn't just leave behind it
sewer lines and water pipes,

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:19.824
in Britain, the broad
boulevards of Paris and Lyon,

00:02:19.824 --> 00:02:23.038
the rebuilt Lower City of
Naples;

00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:28.854
in addition it left behind it a
major debate on the causes of

00:02:28.854 --> 00:02:33.410
disease, and epidemic diseases
in particular.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.875
And this is the debate between
contagionism and

00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:39.720
anticontagionism.
 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.660
It's useful for us to turn to
this debate also because it

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.866
helps us to prepare the ground
for one of the most important

00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:53.660
discoveries in the history of
science,

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.661
and certainly medical science,
and that's the establishment of

00:02:57.661 --> 00:03:02.485
the germ theory of disease,
which is our topic for next

00:03:02.485 --> 00:03:03.120
week.
 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.387
So, what we'll want to do then
is we'll be moving towards the

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:10.669
victory of contagionism.
 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:16.280
This is a debate then that
really mattered in medical

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.360
history.
 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.495
Now, in discussing this issue,
there are a couple of pitfalls

00:03:22.495 --> 00:03:25.318
that I think we ought to avoid.
 

00:03:25.318 --> 00:03:29.893
They're distorting and make it
difficult for us really to

00:03:29.893 --> 00:03:34.383
understand history in general,
and history of science in

00:03:34.383 --> 00:03:35.610
particular.
 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.310
Let me point out two pitfalls.
 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.133
The first is a possibility of
what's been called the Whiggish

00:03:44.133 --> 00:03:45.580
view of history.
 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.276
In its application to science,
it sees history of science as a

00:03:51.276 --> 00:03:56.693
linear, upward march of truth,
moving steadily forward over

00:03:56.693 --> 00:04:02.604
ignorance and obscurantism;
that is, a history of constant

00:04:02.604 --> 00:04:03.610
progress.
 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.355
And it's reinforced if our
history of science deals and

00:04:08.355 --> 00:04:13.188
examines exclusively the ideas
that finally triumph,

00:04:13.188 --> 00:04:16.740
so that we study only a
constant progress,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.209
the march from one great idea
to the next.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.528
Another possible danger and
pitfall is what's called

00:04:26.528 --> 00:04:30.130
presentism,
which I might define as the

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.889
rather smug view that science
all along has been striving,

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.509
almost in Lamarckian manner,
to make the benighted people of

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.889
the past finally emerge as smart
as we are,

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.771
and we get to look back
condescendingly on the thinkers

00:04:49.771 --> 00:04:54.571
of past centuries,
giving them marks for how right

00:04:54.571 --> 00:04:58.410
or how wrong we now know that
they were.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.312
So, to avoid those pitfalls,
what I'd like to do is to

00:05:03.312 --> 00:05:06.829
approach this in a different
spirit.

00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:11.564
Next time I will take the more
traditional path of looking at

00:05:11.564 --> 00:05:14.800
the victorious germ theory of
disease,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.627
and at that point we'll pay our
respects to the famous trio of

00:05:19.627 --> 00:05:23.346
nineteenth-century science that
you all know of:

00:05:23.346 --> 00:05:28.540
Louis Pasteur,
Robert Koch, Joseph Lister.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.134
And in doing that,
we'll notice that what

00:05:32.134 --> 00:05:36.990
triumphed wasn't only
disembodied scientific truth--

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.870
I'm not disputing,
let me stress this,

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.726
I'm not going to be disputing
the truth of the germ theory of

00:05:43.726 --> 00:05:44.370
disease.
 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.410
But what I'll want to do is
something a little more subtle,

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.754
which is to notice that what
triumphed wasn't just

00:05:51.754 --> 00:05:55.163
disembodied truth,
but also a worldview,

00:05:55.163 --> 00:05:58.829
and that when that worldview
won out,

00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:04.199
there were some losses as well,
that went with it.

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:08.088
The germ theory of disease is
one of the greatest advances in

00:06:08.088 --> 00:06:09.709
the history of science.
 

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:13.360
But we need to argue that
although true,

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.769
it perhaps wasn't the entirely
of truth,

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:21.160
and that its establishment as a
reigning orthodoxy,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.120
by the end of the nineteenth
century--

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.894
because it does,
in fact, come to be held by the

00:06:27.894 --> 00:06:33.887
entirety of the international
medical community really after

00:06:33.887 --> 00:06:36.629
around the 1890s or so.
 

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:41.720
And that brought with it one of
its consequences--

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.148
an unintended one--was certain
negative impacts on

00:06:46.148 --> 00:06:51.120
understanding of disease that
we'll be talking about.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.579
And to understand and
appreciate this fact,

00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:59.509
I'm going to concentrate this
morning not on the victors--

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:03.389
you know about them already,
to some extent,

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:08.069
and we'll be turning to them
for the whole of next week--

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:12.600
but I'd like to look instead at
someone you probably don't know,

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.259
or maybe not know at all.
 

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:20.055
In fact, just out of curiously,
before we talked about him in

00:07:20.055 --> 00:07:24.132
our course and reading,
how many of you had actually

00:07:24.132 --> 00:07:26.769
heard of Max van Pettenkofer?
 

00:07:26.769 --> 00:07:31.026
See, that's what I suspected,
actually no one had heard of

00:07:31.026 --> 00:07:32.670
Max van Pettenkofer.
 

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.333
All the more reason we're going
to--the good news for you is

00:07:36.333 --> 00:07:40.059
we're going to be dealing with
him for the next forty minutes

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:40.680
or so.
 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:47.547
He's the most sophisticated and
scientifically robust of those

00:07:47.547 --> 00:07:51.600
who were, as we might call,
wrong.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.235
He lived from 1818 to 1901,
and one of the great figures of

00:07:57.235 --> 00:08:00.930
nineteenth century medical
science,

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:07.723
although his scientific defeat
was total and humiliating by the

00:08:07.723 --> 00:08:08.600
1890s.
 

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.273
And, indeed,
that might form part of the

00:08:11.273 --> 00:08:15.250
background to the fact that he
was to commit suicide at the

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:20.209
turn of the twentieth century,
when he shot himself.

00:08:20.209 --> 00:08:24.151
But I'm going to try to
understand that he was not just

00:08:24.151 --> 00:08:26.997
simply wrong,
but I'll argue that he was

00:08:26.997 --> 00:08:30.504
splendidly wrong;
that his mistaken ideas

00:08:30.504 --> 00:08:33.509
actually saved millions of
lives,

00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:37.798
and that their defeat had a
paradoxical consequence,

00:08:37.798 --> 00:08:40.820
not only of advancing medical
science,

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.783
but in some ways impoverishing
it, in ways that are important

00:08:44.783 --> 00:08:47.230
and that we might want to
consider.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.350
Well, who was Max van
Pettenkofer?

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:54.769
And since you hadn't met him
before, let me introduce you to

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:55.220
him.
 

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.330
And here he is, in splendor.
 

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:04.720
And he was a German scientist
and physician.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:11.214
In particular--map of
Germany--Pettenkofer is

00:09:11.214 --> 00:09:16.250
associated with Bavaria,
here in the south of

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.980
Germany--let's look at that a
little more closely--

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:23.298
and he was associated
especially with the city of

00:09:23.298 --> 00:09:24.110
Munich.
 

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.346
And I'm pointing this out to
you, not simply so that you'll

00:09:27.346 --> 00:09:29.960
know where he's from;
although that's nice to know.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.308
But this is extremely
significant in his theories,

00:09:33.308 --> 00:09:38.101
in that he tends to be the
defender of localism and the

00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:43.626
autonomy of Bavaria and Munich,
against the centralizing

00:09:43.626 --> 00:09:47.178
tendencies of Germany as a
whole.

00:09:47.178 --> 00:09:51.192
So, it has a political
significance that we'll be

00:09:51.192 --> 00:09:52.279
turning to.
 

00:09:52.279 --> 00:09:54.649
Now, what were his social
origins?

00:09:54.649 --> 00:09:56.340
Who was he?
 

00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:02.854
He came from a Catholic family
of very modest means but lots of

00:10:02.854 --> 00:10:04.009
children.
 

00:10:04.009 --> 00:10:07.158
And the family,
that is his nuclear family,

00:10:07.158 --> 00:10:11.349
didn't really have the means to
afford him with a higher

00:10:11.349 --> 00:10:14.740
education,
and he gained that because of

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:15.570
an uncle.
 

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:20.278
He had a wealthier uncle,
who was a prominent apothecary,

00:10:20.278 --> 00:10:24.231
but alas, had no sons,
and he wanted his nephew,

00:10:24.231 --> 00:10:27.678
Max, to carry on the family
business.

00:10:27.678 --> 00:10:32.927
So, Max van Pettenkofer started
out life by studying pharmacy

00:10:32.927 --> 00:10:35.726
and chemistry,
and this, in fact,

00:10:35.726 --> 00:10:40.100
was to have an impact on his
medical theories.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:44.486
But he soon discovered that he
hated the subjects he had

00:10:44.486 --> 00:10:50.219
originally enrolled in to study,
and he terminally disappointed

00:10:50.219 --> 00:10:55.019
his uncle when he enrolled as a
medical student.

00:10:55.019 --> 00:10:59.427
And he gained his medical
degree in 1843 from the

00:10:59.427 --> 00:11:01.538
University of Munich.
 

00:11:01.538 --> 00:11:05.201
Thereafter, he had a varied
career for a few years,

00:11:05.201 --> 00:11:08.788
casting about for what he
wanted to do in life.

00:11:08.788 --> 00:11:14.070
He worked for a while for a
mint, and he even had a failed

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:17.220
attempt to become a stage actor.
 

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:21.355
But in 1847,
he gained appointment to the

00:11:21.355 --> 00:11:27.144
medical faculty at Munich,
and became also a professor of

00:11:27.144 --> 00:11:29.418
organic chemistry.
 

00:11:29.418 --> 00:11:32.995
From then on,
he enjoyed a meteoric career as

00:11:32.995 --> 00:11:37.626
one of the rising stars of
science in Bavaria and Germany,

00:11:37.626 --> 00:11:39.740
and Europe in general.
 

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:44.392
He became advisor to the
Bavarian Government,

00:11:44.392 --> 00:11:48.940
and a full Professor of
Medicine in 1853.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:55.888
Now, 1854 changed his life,
and it did so in relationship

00:11:55.888 --> 00:12:01.720
to an outbreak of Asiatic
cholera in Germany.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:06.336
And it's interesting that this
is the very same epidemic that

00:12:06.336 --> 00:12:08.259
Snow studied in London.
 

00:12:08.259 --> 00:12:11.152
But whereas Snow was a
contagionist,

00:12:11.152 --> 00:12:15.450
Pettenkofer reached the exact
opposite conclusion;

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.782
indeed, thereafter he became a
lifelong opponent of Snow's

00:12:19.782 --> 00:12:24.260
ideas and what he referred to,
with scorn, as "the

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.480
English water mania."
 

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.702
The English,
he said, were obsessed with

00:12:30.702 --> 00:12:31.570
water.
 

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:36.408
Well, what was the debate and
why was it so passionately held?

00:12:36.408 --> 00:12:40.653
Now, the debate was obviously
about the issue of whether

00:12:40.653 --> 00:12:43.200
diseases are contagious or not.
 

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.440
But it didn't involve all
disease.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.467
No one doubted,
in the nineteenth century,

00:12:50.467 --> 00:12:53.023
that syphilis,
for example,

00:12:53.023 --> 00:12:54.889
was contagious.
 

00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:59.759
The debate was about a subset
of diseases,

00:12:59.759 --> 00:13:05.778
five in particular:
leprosy, typhus,

00:13:05.778 --> 00:13:09.716
and then what we might call
"the big three":

00:13:09.716 --> 00:13:13.908
plague,
yellow fever and cholera.

00:13:13.908 --> 00:13:16.886
In other words,
the debate centered on the

00:13:16.886 --> 00:13:20.446
diseases that were the most
feared diseases of the

00:13:20.446 --> 00:13:23.662
nineteenth century,
and so the debate was

00:13:23.662 --> 00:13:27.798
passionate because it concerned
diseases that were extremely

00:13:27.798 --> 00:13:28.710
important.
 

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.769
And it wasn't just a matter of
academic disagreement.

00:13:32.769 --> 00:13:38.841
The decision on whether you
defined a disease as contagious

00:13:38.841 --> 00:13:42.610
or not had a practical
importance.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:47.841
It meant what are going to be
the public health strategies

00:13:47.841 --> 00:13:50.870
that you'd devise to combat it?
 

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:55.916
And the European powers were
greatly divided as to whether

00:13:55.916 --> 00:14:00.607
they should defend themselves by
quarantine, the great

00:14:00.607 --> 00:14:03.528
contagionist measure,
or not.

00:14:03.528 --> 00:14:07.140
Well the two sides in the
debate then were contagionism

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.679
and anticontagionism.
 

00:14:08.679 --> 00:14:12.100
Let's start with contagionism.
 

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:17.879
This wasn't a new idea at all
in the nineteenth century.

00:14:17.879 --> 00:14:20.658
But it was unknown to the
Greeks.

00:14:20.658 --> 00:14:23.820
But it was part of biblical
tradition.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.724
And you've heard of its
popularization already by the

00:14:27.724 --> 00:14:31.928
Italian physician Fracastoro in
the sixteenth century.

00:14:31.928 --> 00:14:38.532
Contagionism had a widespread
importance in popular culture as

00:14:38.532 --> 00:14:39.288
well.
 

00:14:39.288 --> 00:14:43.032
The contagionist idea,
by the nineteenth century,

00:14:43.032 --> 00:14:46.620
was that there was some
infectious material.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.240
Some people thought it was a
poison--a chemical,

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.548
in other words.
 

00:14:51.548 --> 00:14:55.298
Others, that it might be--it
was pure speculation--

00:14:55.298 --> 00:14:58.101
a living entity,
an animalcule--you'll see that

00:14:58.101 --> 00:15:00.403
word in John Snow,
for example,

00:15:00.403 --> 00:15:03.480
in one of his speculative
moments--

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.100
that was transmitted in some
manner,

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.730
perhaps person to person,
perhaps through the pores,

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:13.580
perhaps by contact with a sick
person,

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:18.097
perhaps by objects that had
been in contact with that

00:15:18.097 --> 00:15:18.879
person.
 

00:15:18.879 --> 00:15:25.250
And you've just been reading a
very powerful expression of the

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:30.369
contagionist position,
and that's the work of John

00:15:30.369 --> 00:15:31.308
Snow.
 

00:15:31.308 --> 00:15:37.267
But an important thing to
remember was that down to the

00:15:37.267 --> 00:15:40.453
1890s,
contagionism--and this may

00:15:40.453 --> 00:15:44.116
surprise you--
was primarily the standpoint of

00:15:44.116 --> 00:15:48.488
popular culture,
rather than of the medical

00:15:48.488 --> 00:15:49.288
elite.
 

00:15:49.288 --> 00:15:53.631
Whereas anticontagionism
dominated the international

00:15:53.631 --> 00:15:55.418
medical profession.
 

00:15:55.418 --> 00:16:01.195
Most men of science regarded
contagionism as a view held by

00:16:01.195 --> 00:16:04.980
the ignorant and the
superstitious,

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:10.320
and indeed the irony is that
contagionism reached a nadir,

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.196
in respectability,
just before the work of Koch

00:16:15.196 --> 00:16:20.389
and Pasteur demonstrated its
ultimate vitality.

00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:25.535
To understand that,
take an example that by now you

00:16:25.535 --> 00:16:29.860
know extremely well,
and that is plague.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.684
To the layman,
the spread of plague seemed to

00:16:32.684 --> 00:16:35.190
justify the idea that by some
means,

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:37.678
that people still didn't
understand,

00:16:37.678 --> 00:16:41.158
it spread from one person to
another.

00:16:41.158 --> 00:16:47.886
But to the learned physician,
the case for contagion still

00:16:47.886 --> 00:16:49.538
seemed weak.
 

00:16:49.538 --> 00:16:54.206
There wasn't a mechanism to
explain what it was,

00:16:54.206 --> 00:16:56.690
how it was transmitted.
 

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.879
In many cases,
close inspection seemed to

00:16:59.879 --> 00:17:04.105
demonstrate that the disease
spread without the direct

00:17:04.105 --> 00:17:08.808
contact that the contagionist
view seemed to postulate.

00:17:08.808 --> 00:17:13.448
People caught the plague who
hadn't been in immediate contact

00:17:13.448 --> 00:17:15.690
with another plague victim.
 

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.877
Conversely, where there was
such contact,

00:17:18.877 --> 00:17:23.422
often the plague didn't spread,
and people who cared for a

00:17:23.422 --> 00:17:26.930
plague victim sometimes didn't
fall ill.

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:29.750
How could that be explained?
 

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:33.820
Furthermore,
epidemics of plague began and

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:39.085
ended in the most mysterious
manner, that no one could

00:17:39.085 --> 00:17:41.269
plausibly explain.
 

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:45.917
And to strengthen their case,
the contagionists would need to

00:17:45.917 --> 00:17:49.558
discard their theory of
inanimate contagion,

00:17:49.558 --> 00:17:53.670
replacing it with something
that was living.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.171
Furthermore,
there was the need for the idea

00:17:57.171 --> 00:18:01.240
of transmission of over
distance, by water perhaps,

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.009
food supplies,
or later, we'll see,

00:18:04.009 --> 00:18:05.720
insect vectors.
 

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:10.670
But the debate was also fueled
by political conclusions,

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:14.000
by politics,
because major conclusions

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.318
followed from the position that
one adopted.

00:18:18.318 --> 00:18:21.057
Contagionists,
in their scientific

00:18:21.057 --> 00:18:25.619
conclusions, were people who
buttressed the power of the

00:18:25.619 --> 00:18:26.450
state.
 

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:31.088
Because in the name of state
power, one could institute the

00:18:31.088 --> 00:18:34.608
most draconian measures:
cordons, lazarettos,

00:18:34.608 --> 00:18:35.808
quarantine.
 

00:18:35.808 --> 00:18:42.027
You could sequester and confine
individuals, you could limit

00:18:42.027 --> 00:18:46.769
civil liberty,
and you could radically control

00:18:46.769 --> 00:18:50.880
the movement of goods and of
trade.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:58.460
So, one of the results then of
contagionism--you can see here

00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.848
the idea.
 

00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:04.895
Here you have cholera,
yellow fever and plague trying

00:19:04.895 --> 00:19:08.390
to enter the citadel at the
gates.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:13.346
And here we have quarantine and
the draconian measures that

00:19:13.346 --> 00:19:14.970
follow from that.
 

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.131
Cleanliness,
you know--by now,

00:19:17.131 --> 00:19:21.007
you're experts on the filth
theory of disease and the

00:19:21.007 --> 00:19:23.838
measures to be adopted against
it.

00:19:23.838 --> 00:19:29.344
The idea of contagionism
buttressed those ideas of a

00:19:29.344 --> 00:19:33.769
strong, powerful state
interventionism.

00:19:33.769 --> 00:19:37.979
Let's turn then to their
opponents, the

00:19:37.979 --> 00:19:43.185
anticontagionists,
the people who were skeptical

00:19:43.185 --> 00:19:47.838
with regard to the ideas of John
Snow.

00:19:47.838 --> 00:19:53.799
These were largely associated
with the political left.

00:19:53.799 --> 00:19:55.680
Why?
 

00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:01.650
Anticontagionism implied free
trade.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:07.145
It was associated with
liberalism, and with the defense

00:20:07.145 --> 00:20:13.660
of individual liberties against
arbitrary state bureaucracies.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:18.316
It implied opposition to
extreme, and sometimes violent,

00:20:18.316 --> 00:20:21.278
plague measures of public
health.

00:20:21.278 --> 00:20:26.193
So, it wasn't by coincidence
that it was a good idea to look

00:20:26.193 --> 00:20:29.784
at a map of Germany,
because the most important of

00:20:29.784 --> 00:20:32.111
the contagionists,
Robert Koch,

00:20:32.111 --> 00:20:38.161
was an icon and promoter of the
power of the centralized German

00:20:38.161 --> 00:20:39.038
state.
 

00:20:39.038 --> 00:20:42.679
He worked in Berlin,
and that wasn't by chance,

00:20:42.679 --> 00:20:46.160
and he defended the
centralizing and imperial

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.848
interests of the German Reich.
 

00:20:48.848 --> 00:20:52.588
Whereas Pettenkofer was a
liberal,

00:20:52.588 --> 00:20:57.380
who championed the local
interests of Bavaria and Munich,

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:01.779
and indeed his theories
coincided--both medically and

00:21:01.779 --> 00:21:06.410
politically,
they were sometimes referred to

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:07.818
as localism.
 

00:21:07.818 --> 00:21:13.508
Another way of seeing the
stakes in this debate is to

00:21:13.508 --> 00:21:18.978
remember that Britain long
opposed the contagionist

00:21:18.978 --> 00:21:23.951
position,
in part for political and

00:21:23.951 --> 00:21:26.430
economic reasons.
 

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.875
That is to say,
Britain was ranged in the

00:21:29.875 --> 00:21:34.960
international conferences
largely with anticontagionists;

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.784
in part because its interests
prospered best through free

00:21:39.784 --> 00:21:42.549
trade,
and it felt threatened by

00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:47.405
medical arguments that implied
that the state should interfere

00:21:47.405 --> 00:21:51.801
with commerce,
impounding British ships and

00:21:51.801 --> 00:21:56.140
quarantining their crews for
forty days.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:00.491
The anticontagionists also had
the imprimatur,

00:22:00.491 --> 00:22:03.201
should we like,
of tradition,

00:22:03.201 --> 00:22:06.490
of the authority of tradition.
 

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:11.278
Their views were sanctioned by
Hippocrates and Galen,

00:22:11.278 --> 00:22:15.415
and were buttressed by a whole
panoply of ideas that had grown

00:22:15.415 --> 00:22:19.859
up later but were,
if we like, compatible with the

00:22:19.859 --> 00:22:23.269
traditional practice of
medicine,

00:22:23.269 --> 00:22:26.838
with the idea of atmospheric
influences,

00:22:26.838 --> 00:22:30.230
of the epidemic constitution,
as it was called--

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:33.538
a bit of jargon for you--of the
atmosphere.

00:22:33.538 --> 00:22:39.029
And it was compatible with the
filth and miasmic theory.

00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:43.804
Let's also remember that
anticontagionism inspired some

00:22:43.804 --> 00:22:48.490
robust health measures as well,
and it saved lives.

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:52.297
Anticontagionism was the view
of people like Chadwick,

00:22:52.297 --> 00:22:54.883
whom you know now,
and his associate,

00:22:54.883 --> 00:22:56.318
Southwood Smith.
 

00:22:56.318 --> 00:23:00.300
It was the view of Haussmann
and the Second Empire,

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:04.838
and it was the official
doctrine of risanamento;

00:23:04.838 --> 00:23:08.950
that is, the rebuilding of
Naples.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:12.130
Now, in the history of medicine
and public health,

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:17.335
and epidemiology,
the cholera epidemic of 1854

00:23:17.335 --> 00:23:21.707
looms large,
giving rise to two foundational

00:23:21.707 --> 00:23:26.308
texts of epidemiology,
on opposite sides of the debate.

00:23:26.308 --> 00:23:28.740
On the one side we see John
Snow;

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.192
and you've read his On the
Mode of Communication of

00:23:32.192 --> 00:23:35.868
Cholera,
the final version of which--it

00:23:35.868 --> 00:23:41.134
was first drafted in 1849,
but the draft that you have

00:23:41.134 --> 00:23:43.880
appeared after this event.
 

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.215
And this was the classic
statement of the contagionist

00:23:47.215 --> 00:23:50.361
view,
to the extent that it could be

00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:55.467
supported without the definitive
evidence later provided by

00:23:55.467 --> 00:23:56.700
microscopy.
 

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.775
So, Snow did everything that it
was possible to do,

00:24:00.775 --> 00:24:04.848
purely on the basis of
epidemiological evidence.

00:24:04.848 --> 00:24:09.983
There was going to need to be a
conceptual shift in order to

00:24:09.983 --> 00:24:14.857
clinch his view and demonstrate
it so that it was broadly

00:24:14.857 --> 00:24:15.990
accepted.
 

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:20.009
On the other side,
we see a book that's been--it's

00:24:20.009 --> 00:24:24.851
not even on our own reading
list--a book that's been largely

00:24:24.851 --> 00:24:26.000
forgotten.
 

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.546
This is Max van Pettenkofer's
work called Investigations

00:24:31.546 --> 00:24:36.806
and Observations on the Method
of Spread of Cholera,

00:24:36.806 --> 00:24:38.910
published in 1855.
 

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:44.651
And this--I should say that
Pettenkofer was no less rigorous

00:24:44.651 --> 00:24:48.348
as an epidemiologist than John
Snow.

00:24:48.348 --> 00:24:51.855
And this was a major
foundational text in

00:24:51.855 --> 00:24:53.170
epidemiology.
 

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:57.625
It was a study of the 1854
epidemic in Bavaria,

00:24:57.625 --> 00:25:03.436
reaching conclusions that were
diametrically opposed to those

00:25:03.436 --> 00:25:04.598
of Snow.
 

00:25:04.598 --> 00:25:10.826
From 1854, cholera became a
lifelong preoccupation of Max

00:25:10.826 --> 00:25:15.241
van Pettenkofer,
and he devoted himself to the

00:25:15.241 --> 00:25:18.338
epidemiological study of the
disease,

00:25:18.338 --> 00:25:24.502
staking his reputation on high
profile debates with Robert

00:25:24.502 --> 00:25:25.259
Koch.
 

00:25:25.259 --> 00:25:28.750
He was to write some two
hundred articles and books

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:32.240
during his lifetime,
on a whole range of scientific

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.009
topics.
 

00:25:33.009 --> 00:25:36.961
But the largest number,
about sixty,

00:25:36.961 --> 00:25:43.509
were devoted to cholera,
and its transmission and cause.

00:25:43.509 --> 00:25:48.897
So, Pettenkofer--and the reason
we're dealing with him now is he

00:25:48.897 --> 00:25:51.938
was the last major,
and the best,

00:25:51.938 --> 00:25:55.859
defender of the
anticontagionist doctrine,

00:25:55.859 --> 00:25:58.630
of miasmatism, in other words.
 

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:02.652
And he defended it until his
death at the dawn of the

00:26:02.652 --> 00:26:04.200
twentieth century.
 

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:08.368
He adopted the traditional
doctrine, dating back to

00:26:08.368 --> 00:26:12.704
antiquity, but provided it with
a new evidence-based,

00:26:12.704 --> 00:26:15.038
scientific underpinning.
 

00:26:15.038 --> 00:26:20.971
Well, why was Pettenkofer not
convinced by Snow when it came

00:26:20.971 --> 00:26:22.279
to cholera?
 

00:26:22.279 --> 00:26:25.150
Part of the reason you know.
 

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.593
Contagionism,
Pettenkofer said--and in this

00:26:28.593 --> 00:26:33.758
he was right--it didn't produce
a really plausible mechanism for

00:26:33.758 --> 00:26:36.710
the transmission of the disease.
 

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:41.279
It correlated cholera cases
with drinking water.

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:45.441
But to Pettenkofer,
there seemed no means of

00:26:45.441 --> 00:26:50.279
explaining exactly what was
transmitted, or how.

00:26:50.279 --> 00:26:54.729
Also, as you know,
Pettenkofer had been trained as

00:26:54.729 --> 00:26:57.613
a chemist,
and he looked at the

00:26:57.613 --> 00:27:02.381
traditional idea that the
cholera poison was some sort of

00:27:02.381 --> 00:27:06.566
chemical substance,
and he argued that it was

00:27:06.566 --> 00:27:11.643
entirely improbable that a
disease could be spread then in

00:27:11.643 --> 00:27:13.868
the manner postulated.
 

00:27:13.868 --> 00:27:18.957
Looking at London and the River
Thames, how could a poison

00:27:18.957 --> 00:27:23.061
contaminating the Thames,
if it was a chemical,

00:27:23.061 --> 00:27:25.740
not be infinitely diluted?
 

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:29.259
Furthermore,
he said there was a whole

00:27:29.259 --> 00:27:34.680
series of what we might call
cholera mysteries that Snow's

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.390
position didn't help to
illuminate.

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:44.960
Why did an epidemic start,
and why did it end?

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:50.262
Why could doctors provide their
services in the midst of an

00:27:50.262 --> 00:27:55.750
epidemic of cholera and yet not
fall ill of it themselves?

00:27:55.750 --> 00:28:00.058
What caused the pronounced
seasonality of cholera?

00:28:00.058 --> 00:28:04.410
Why was its onset almost
invariably in the spring and the

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:05.108
summer?
 

00:28:05.108 --> 00:28:10.713
And why did an outbreak always
seem to ebb with the onset of

00:28:10.713 --> 00:28:12.140
cold weather?
 

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.626
And then lastly,
for the moment,

00:28:14.626 --> 00:28:18.720
there was what we might call
the problem of Lyon;

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:22.480
that is, the great second city
of France.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:27.236
If cholera is contagious,
and if it follows the great

00:28:27.236 --> 00:28:31.170
routes of trade and population
movement,

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.108
why is it that there are,
nonetheless,

00:28:34.108 --> 00:28:39.009
major centers that escaped
throughout the nineteenth

00:28:39.009 --> 00:28:39.970
century?
 

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:44.750
Lyon was the second largest
city in France,

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:49.538
located at the hub of a network
of trade and transportation,

00:28:49.538 --> 00:28:54.646
and it had all the--it was a
great textile center of

00:28:54.646 --> 00:28:58.756
manufacturing--
and it had all the urban

00:28:58.756 --> 00:29:03.368
problems of an industrial center
at its time.

00:29:03.368 --> 00:29:08.460
If ever, Pettenkofer would say,
there was a city that seemed

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:12.430
primed to be devastated by
Asiatic cholera,

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:16.701
it was Lyon,
and yet it escaped the

00:29:16.701 --> 00:29:22.480
visitations of this exotic
Asiatic outsider.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.250
Well, what was Pettenkofer's
theory?

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:31.773
And it was his delight to
believe that he could provide an

00:29:31.773 --> 00:29:36.352
apparently clear,
epidemiologically-based

00:29:36.352 --> 00:29:42.190
explanation for all of those
cholera mysteries.

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:47.010
Indeed, another aspect of his
theory--that Robert Koch

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:50.650
discovered the Vibrio
cholerae.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:54.069
You've seen a picture of the
Vibrio.

00:29:54.069 --> 00:29:58.440
And he discovered it in 1883.
 

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:03.880
Pettenkofer didn't reject the
idea of the Vibrio.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:09.414
Instead, he incorporated it
elegantly into his larger

00:30:09.414 --> 00:30:12.944
theory,
explaining that it played a

00:30:12.944 --> 00:30:18.392
role in the etiology of cholera,
but that its role and its

00:30:18.392 --> 00:30:23.356
mechanism were completely
different from the ones that

00:30:23.356 --> 00:30:24.950
Koch espoused.
 

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:29.339
Pettenkofer's theory is often
referred to as the groundwater

00:30:29.339 --> 00:30:30.009
theory.
 

00:30:30.009 --> 00:30:32.200
We've seen it can be called
localism.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:36.990
It can be called the
groundwater theory.

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:40.907
The simplest approach to his
method is a very simple

00:30:40.907 --> 00:30:44.442
mathematical equation,
that he was very fond of

00:30:44.442 --> 00:30:47.440
himself, for illustrative
purposes.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:53.863
It was perhaps the simplest of
all mathematical formulas:

00:30:53.863 --> 00:30:55.009
X Y = Z.
 

00:30:55.009 --> 00:30:59.250
What did that mean to Max van
Pettenkofer?

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:03.240
Well, for him,
Z was a cholera outbreak,

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:07.230
the result then of combining X
and Y.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.554
It's produced,
in other words,

00:31:09.554 --> 00:31:13.884
under certain specific
conditions of two other factors,

00:31:13.884 --> 00:31:16.608
the X factor and the Y factor.
 

00:31:16.608 --> 00:31:19.232
The X factor,
he said, was the presence of

00:31:19.232 --> 00:31:21.088
the Vibrio cholerae.
 

00:31:21.088 --> 00:31:26.578
You see, he accepts that the
Vibrio plays a role.

00:31:26.578 --> 00:31:30.439
But for Pettenkofer,
the Vibrio itself,

00:31:30.439 --> 00:31:33.868
on its own, would never make
you sick.

00:31:33.868 --> 00:31:39.220
You could swallow it quite
safely and remain entirely

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.250
healthy.
 

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:43.068
He regarded it as harmless on
its own,

00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:47.089
and as we'll see in a moment,
he carried out a famous

00:31:47.089 --> 00:31:50.723
auto-experiment in which he
tried to demonstrate

00:31:50.723 --> 00:31:53.740
conclusively the truth of his
view.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.915
In other words,
he made himself a cocktail of

00:31:56.915 --> 00:32:00.019
the Vibrio cholerae and
drank it,

00:32:00.019 --> 00:32:02.994
and, in fact,
he remained healthy,

00:32:02.994 --> 00:32:07.862
and therefore persuaded,
to the end of his life,

00:32:07.862 --> 00:32:12.940
that the Vibrio on its
own was harmless.

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:17.645
He was to say that the
Vibrio causes disease in

00:32:17.645 --> 00:32:20.755
an entirely different,
but orthodox,

00:32:20.755 --> 00:32:22.618
miasmatic manner.
 

00:32:22.618 --> 00:32:28.172
The danger doesn't arise when
the Vibrio contaminates

00:32:28.172 --> 00:32:30.619
food and drinking water.
 

00:32:30.619 --> 00:32:32.190
The problem is different.
 

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:36.180
It happens when the
Vibrio gets into the soil

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:37.980
beneath a major city.
 

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:42.721
And there, Pettenkofer used a
horticultural analogy,

00:32:42.721 --> 00:32:46.720
referring to germination or
fermentation.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.029
After the Vibrio gained
access to the soil,

00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:54.440
under certain conditions it
could germinate like a plant and

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.578
give off its poison into the air
above,

00:32:57.578 --> 00:33:02.212
that the population inhaled,
and those who were susceptible

00:33:02.212 --> 00:33:07.689
fell ill in large numbers,
and it was then that you'd have

00:33:07.689 --> 00:33:10.338
the onset of an epidemic.
 

00:33:10.338 --> 00:33:13.460
In nineteenth-century medical
parlance,

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:18.002
cholera was an example of a
whole category of diseases that

00:33:18.002 --> 00:33:24.630
were called zymotic diseases,
diseases caused by fermentation.

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:29.023
So that we see the X factor
involves the Vibrio

00:33:29.023 --> 00:33:30.368
cholerae.
 

00:33:30.368 --> 00:33:36.318
Then the Y factor was simply
those local conditions--

00:33:36.318 --> 00:33:40.727
again localism--that were
necessary for fermentation to

00:33:40.727 --> 00:33:44.605
take place,
and for poison to be given off

00:33:44.605 --> 00:33:46.519
into the atmosphere.
 

00:33:46.519 --> 00:33:49.328
What makes up the Y factor?
 

00:33:49.328 --> 00:33:53.705
Again let's think of
horticulture and the growth of a

00:33:53.705 --> 00:33:54.380
plant.
 

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:59.765
A plant doesn't need only soil
to develop, it also needs

00:33:59.765 --> 00:34:02.410
nutrients and fertilizer.
 

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:07.298
And here was the critical role
of filth and excrement.

00:34:07.298 --> 00:34:12.467
They were, in Pettenkofer's
mind, the nutrients for this

00:34:12.467 --> 00:34:15.849
plant, the Vibrio
cholerae.

00:34:15.849 --> 00:34:21.518
Unsanitary urban conditions
literally fed the Vibrio.

00:34:21.518 --> 00:34:24.963
Sewage was dangerous,
not because it got into the

00:34:24.963 --> 00:34:27.742
water,
but because it seeped into the

00:34:27.742 --> 00:34:31.978
soil beneath the city,
nourishing the Vibrio

00:34:31.978 --> 00:34:34.960
and giving rise to fermentation.
 

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:39.679
But there's more to it,
in Pettenkofer's epidemiology.

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:43.429
Like a plant,
fermentation required a number

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:45.610
of other preconditions.
 

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:49.380
It needed water;
plants always need water.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:52.510
It needed a warm temperature.
 

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:56.989
It needed air and porous soil
in which to grow.

00:34:56.989 --> 00:35:01.469
And it was at this point that
we see why Pettenkofer's theory

00:35:01.469 --> 00:35:04.829
is sometimes called the
groundwater theory.

00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:09.161
Groundwater was important to
his analysis because he

00:35:09.161 --> 00:35:14.172
considered variations in the
water table beneath the city to

00:35:14.172 --> 00:35:19.014
be a measure of the capacity of
a soil beneath the city to

00:35:19.014 --> 00:35:24.280
support fermentation and give
rise to cholera epidemics.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.972
Too high a water table would be
like flooding,

00:35:27.972 --> 00:35:30.599
and that would kill the plant.
 

00:35:30.599 --> 00:35:35.159
Too low a table would be like a
drought or a desert.

00:35:35.159 --> 00:35:40.253
So, for a cholera epidemic,
the ideal was an ebbing water

00:35:40.253 --> 00:35:44.440
table that left moist,
porous soil above it;

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:48.952
a condition that was likely to
be characteristic of the early

00:35:48.952 --> 00:35:49.630
summer.
 

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:53.972
And indeed, Pettenkofer now
thought he understood the

00:35:53.972 --> 00:35:56.059
seasonality of cholera.
 

00:35:56.059 --> 00:36:01.175
He could explain its
seasonality by reference to the

00:36:01.175 --> 00:36:05.489
water table of European and
other cities.

00:36:05.489 --> 00:36:10.003
Armed with this theory,
Pettenkofer proceeded to

00:36:10.003 --> 00:36:14.614
conduct exhaustive
epidemiological studies of the

00:36:14.614 --> 00:36:20.090
local conditions of localities
vulnerable to cholera.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:23.438
For Pettenkofer,
it seemed obvious why

00:36:23.438 --> 00:36:28.690
mountainous areas--the Alps,
for example--weren't afflicted

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:30.230
with cholera.
 

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:34.637
There, there was such a deep
layer of insulation between the

00:36:34.637 --> 00:36:39.047
groundwater and the population,
who were therefore protected

00:36:39.047 --> 00:36:41.139
from the cholera poison.
 

00:36:41.139 --> 00:36:46.621
Similarly, desert areas
provided no conditions for

00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:48.300
fermentation.
 

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:54.480
Pettenkofer also thought that
he had solved the Lyon problem.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:59.862
By investigating and studying
Lyon, he realized that it was

00:36:59.862 --> 00:37:04.409
built on a thick layer of
impenetrable granite.

00:37:04.409 --> 00:37:08.304
It was built on stone,
and therefore provided no

00:37:08.304 --> 00:37:12.199
opportunity for fermentation and
germination.

00:37:12.199 --> 00:37:16.563
The best conditions were
provided by cities that were

00:37:16.563 --> 00:37:19.166
built at sea level,
on alluvial,

00:37:19.166 --> 00:37:20.510
porous soil.
 

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:25.824
This could explain why Naples
was ravaged, Paris,

00:37:25.824 --> 00:37:27.929
London, Calcutta.
 

00:37:27.929 --> 00:37:31.630
And then he decided,
being an honest scientist,

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:34.268
that he should also
investigate, in particular,

00:37:34.268 --> 00:37:37.603
the hard case,
the one that seemed to conflict

00:37:37.603 --> 00:37:41.405
with his theories,
and that was the Island of

00:37:41.405 --> 00:37:42.010
Malta.
 

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:47.184
Malta was built on rock,
but it experienced disaster

00:37:47.184 --> 00:37:51.039
during recurring cholera
pandemics,

00:37:51.039 --> 00:37:53.550
and he thought,
to his own satisfaction,

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:55.530
that he could solve the riddle.
 

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:59.702
Malta, unlike Lyon,
was not built on impermeable

00:37:59.702 --> 00:38:00.590
granite.
 

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:04.849
It had everything to do with
the specifics of the stone

00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:05.559
itself.
 

00:38:05.559 --> 00:38:10.090
Malta was built on porous,
soft limestone,

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:14.409
and that provided infinite
air-filled cavities,

00:38:14.409 --> 00:38:17.619
that if watered and fertilized,
in warm conditions,

00:38:17.619 --> 00:38:21.900
would provide wonderful places
for germination.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.998
You can see Pettenkofer
visiting Malta,

00:38:24.998 --> 00:38:28.670
which he did,
and having his eureka moment.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:30.320
He did core samples.
 

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:34.275
I'm trying to say that
Pettenkofer was a very

00:38:34.275 --> 00:38:38.320
conscientious research
scientist, and a strong

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.030
epidemiologist.
 

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:41.190
And he went further.
 

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:45.750
He argued also that he could
explain not only which cities

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:50.710
were most afflicted by cholera,
but also the very neighborhoods

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:51.989
within them.
 

00:38:51.989 --> 00:38:55.307
Low-lying areas,
close to the water table,

00:38:55.307 --> 00:38:57.980
would be vulnerable to cholera.
 

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:00.909
Neighborhoods built on hills
would be protected.

00:39:00.909 --> 00:39:03.460
Naples was a good example.
 

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:07.135
The Lower City was ravaged,
the Upper City was not,

00:39:07.135 --> 00:39:09.929
and Pettenkofer thought he knew
why.

00:39:09.929 --> 00:39:11.726
Neapolitans,
as you know,

00:39:11.726 --> 00:39:15.847
in fact agreed with him,
and Pettenkofer's theories were

00:39:15.847 --> 00:39:17.570
much admired there.
 

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:23.110
It seemed to explain Neapolitan
history, and it was his theories

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:27.860
that were the very basis for the
rebuilding project.

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:32.599
He saw his great achievement as
that of developing a single

00:39:32.599 --> 00:39:35.440
unified theory,
with no internal

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.954
contradictions,
that could explain all the

00:39:38.954 --> 00:39:44.273
known facts of cholera,
and clarify those puzzling

00:39:44.273 --> 00:39:46.469
cholera mysteries.
 

00:39:46.469 --> 00:39:51.070
Now, an interesting point about
Pettenkofer's theories.

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:54.780
They're now rejected by modern
science.

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:59.599
But during the nineteenth
century, they provided a major

00:39:59.599 --> 00:40:03.630
impetus to undertake needed
sanitary reform.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:08.237
His ideas therefore can be
credited probably with saving

00:40:08.237 --> 00:40:13.097
hundreds of thousands of lives,
from a variety of diarrheal

00:40:13.097 --> 00:40:16.088
illnesses;
cholera, of course,

00:40:16.088 --> 00:40:19.440
but also typhoid,
gastroenteritis.

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:24.190
So, this is a case of an idea
that we now know not to be

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:29.697
robust scientifically,
that nevertheless produced very

00:40:29.697 --> 00:40:35.422
practical results that had a
major impact on combating

00:40:35.422 --> 00:40:37.690
epidemic diseases.
 

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:42.347
Pettenkofer was responsible,
in fact, for bringing the

00:40:42.347 --> 00:40:44.719
sanitary idea to Bavaria.
 

00:40:44.719 --> 00:40:49.121
He wanted to install sewer
systems to take away waste and

00:40:49.121 --> 00:40:52.266
fecal matter,
but not for the reason that

00:40:52.266 --> 00:40:53.840
Snow would have.
 

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:59.070
He wasn't worried that
Bavarians would drink infected

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:02.489
water, or eat contaminated food.
 

00:41:02.489 --> 00:41:06.364
He was afraid that the fecal
matter would get beneath the

00:41:06.364 --> 00:41:09.409
city and would nourish the
Vibrio,

00:41:09.409 --> 00:41:13.788
and thereby give rise to
poisonous fumes that would

00:41:13.788 --> 00:41:15.539
poison the people.
 

00:41:15.539 --> 00:41:21.164
His idea was to make the soil
of Germany's cities infertile,

00:41:21.164 --> 00:41:26.215
and you could do that by
depriving the soil of organic

00:41:26.215 --> 00:41:28.599
matter and excrement.
 

00:41:28.599 --> 00:41:33.409
So, he wanted to supply Germany
with clean water.

00:41:33.409 --> 00:41:36.422
But not specifically clean
drinking water,

00:41:36.422 --> 00:41:40.610
but he wanted to prevent sewage
from gaining access to the

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.989
groundwater and the soil beneath
the city.

00:41:43.989 --> 00:41:48.235
He also championed the idea of
sand filtration of water,

00:41:48.235 --> 00:41:50.090
to ensure clean water.
 

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:55.730
He thought that Snow had been
seriously misled.

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.630
There was a matter of
proportion here.

00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:02.030
Snow, he said,
was really concentrated on the

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:05.630
few liters that a person
consumed.

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:09.224
That water, he argued,
no matter how contaminated,

00:42:09.224 --> 00:42:11.280
would actually do no harm.
 

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:15.619
The real issue was the massive
quantity of water,

00:42:15.619 --> 00:42:19.679
of domestic,
industrial or household waste,

00:42:19.679 --> 00:42:22.739
that carried fertilizer to the
city soil,

00:42:22.739 --> 00:42:25.969
and there dread disease.
 

00:42:25.969 --> 00:42:29.717
Now, Pettenkofer recognized
then that clean water and

00:42:29.717 --> 00:42:32.311
effective sewage,
and waste disposal,

00:42:32.311 --> 00:42:35.340
were essential public health
measures.

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:40.010
So, he had--as his legacy,
Pettenkofer was the founder of

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:42.929
the sanitary movement in
Germany.

00:42:42.929 --> 00:42:46.829
He was also a professor of
hygiene at the University of

00:42:46.829 --> 00:42:47.480
Munich.
 

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:52.170
He founded a journal called
The Archive for Hygiene,

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:55.271
in 1883;
and indeed it's still published

00:42:55.271 --> 00:42:59.634
as The International Journal
of Hygiene and Environmental

00:42:59.634 --> 00:43:00.670
Health.
 

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:04.994
He was the founder of the Max
van Pettenkofer Institute in

00:43:04.994 --> 00:43:09.396
Munich, a world-famous research
institute, dedicated to the

00:43:09.396 --> 00:43:11.750
promotion of public health.
 

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:16.639
He became its director,
and trained people.

00:43:16.639 --> 00:43:19.534
It became a center of research
and training,

00:43:19.534 --> 00:43:20.949
unique at its time.
 

00:43:20.949 --> 00:43:24.914
He was an important figure in
the founding of the Johns

00:43:24.914 --> 00:43:27.409
Hopkins School of Public Health.
 

00:43:27.409 --> 00:43:31.735
And along with his opponent,
John Snow, he was a founding

00:43:31.735 --> 00:43:34.670
father in the field of
epidemiology.

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:38.201
His arguments,
though now largely discredited,

00:43:38.201 --> 00:43:41.420
were supported by prodigious
fieldwork.

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:44.300
You can imagine him going
around Europe,

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:48.050
taking core samples of soil and
rock,

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:52.494
and correlating that with
measurements of the rise and

00:43:52.494 --> 00:43:56.771
fall of groundwater levels,
and correlating all of that

00:43:56.771 --> 00:44:00.500
information with rainfall,
temperature measurements,

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.389
and the history of cholera
outbreaks.

00:44:03.389 --> 00:44:07.934
And Pettenkofer was tireless in
propagating his ideas as a

00:44:07.934 --> 00:44:09.849
lecturer, as a writer.
 

00:44:09.849 --> 00:44:13.927
He was an advisor to the
Bavarian government,

00:44:13.927 --> 00:44:19.579
and he became president of the
Bavarian Academy of Science.

00:44:19.579 --> 00:44:24.106
Another factor was that
Pettenkofer was quite interested

00:44:24.106 --> 00:44:28.880
in something else as well:
what made people susceptible?

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:32.396
And he believed that poor
nutrition was an important

00:44:32.396 --> 00:44:33.570
factor in that.
 

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:38.362
So, his public health policies
also involved attention to diet

00:44:38.362 --> 00:44:39.619
and nutrition.
 

00:44:39.619 --> 00:44:44.920
Of course, some of his
recommendations were misguided.

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:49.434
But one measure he gave great
attention to was also the siting

00:44:49.434 --> 00:44:53.059
of infectious disease hospitals
and cemeteries.

00:44:53.059 --> 00:44:55.726
A cholera hospital,
or a cemetery,

00:44:55.726 --> 00:45:00.494
should be located on a hilltop,
far from the city center and

00:45:00.494 --> 00:45:02.030
downwind of it.
 

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:06.463
That would prevent the cholera
germ from percolating down

00:45:06.463 --> 00:45:09.710
easily into the soil beneath the
city,

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:13.891
and would ensure that any
poisonous miasma that arose

00:45:13.891 --> 00:45:17.190
would be dispersed from the
population.

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:21.039
We can see that he helped the
way--condition--

00:45:21.039 --> 00:45:23.117
-the way Naples,
for example,

00:45:23.117 --> 00:45:26.132
was rebuilt,
and where the infectious

00:45:26.132 --> 00:45:29.619
diseases hospital in that city
was located;

00:45:29.619 --> 00:45:33.690
which was high above the city
and downwind from it.

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:36.487
And as I said,
to prove his theory,

00:45:36.487 --> 00:45:39.860
he tried his dangerous
auto-experiment.

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:45.110
His theory was losing ground by
1892,

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:48.340
when there was a major epidemic
of cholera at Hamburg,

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:53.648
in Germany, and Pettenkofer and
Robert Koch were greatly at

00:45:53.648 --> 00:45:54.289
odds.
 

00:45:54.289 --> 00:45:58.112
To prove his case,
Pettenkofer challenged Koch to

00:45:58.112 --> 00:46:02.733
provide him with a cholera
cocktail, that he volunteered to

00:46:02.733 --> 00:46:03.690
swallow.
 

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:08.349
Koch's collaborator,
Gaffke, duly dispatched a vial

00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:13.755
filled with Vibrio.
There's some interesting ethical

00:46:13.755 --> 00:46:17.630
issues here,
as Gaffke sent Pettenkofer what

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:20.659
he thought was a fatal dose of
cholera,

00:46:20.659 --> 00:46:26.650
and fully expected Pettenkofer
to die an agonizing death.

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:30.199
There are then various accounts
of what happened next.

00:46:30.199 --> 00:46:34.972
One account has it that
Pettenkofer's lab assistants

00:46:34.972 --> 00:46:39.369
intercepted the package and
diluted the dose.

00:46:39.369 --> 00:46:44.210
It's also true that the cholera
cocktail was sent in February,

00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:48.291
and it may well be that the
cold temperature in transit

00:46:48.291 --> 00:46:52.980
attenuated the virulence of the
Vibrio. In any case,

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:56.599
Pettenkofer was a man convinced
of his theory.

00:46:56.599 --> 00:47:01.588
He put his life on the line to
prove it, and he duly swallowed

00:47:01.588 --> 00:47:04.860
the vial that Koch's lab had
provided.

00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:09.289
He fell seriously ill of
diarrhea, but didn't develop the

00:47:09.289 --> 00:47:12.768
symptoms he recognized as
Asiatic cholera.

00:47:12.768 --> 00:47:16.391
He rapidly recovered,
and was convinced that he'd

00:47:16.391 --> 00:47:20.543
proved that the Vibrio
cholerae does not directly

00:47:20.543 --> 00:47:23.940
cause the disease,
not by being ingested.

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:28.380
Well, there was an unhappy
sequel for Pettenkofer.

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:31.197
Koch's microbiology,
by the 1890s,

00:47:31.197 --> 00:47:35.469
convinced the medical world of
the germ theory,

00:47:35.469 --> 00:47:38.010
and miasmatic doctrine of all
kinds,

00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:41.630
including Pettenkoffer's own,
were discredited.

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:45.869
In 1894, he resigned his
university chair.

00:47:45.869 --> 00:47:50.960
In 1899, he resigned from his
other offices.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.851
In the 1890s also,
three of his five children

00:47:54.851 --> 00:47:56.710
died, and his wife.
 

00:47:56.710 --> 00:48:01.793
And on February 9^(th),
1901, Pettenkofer committed

00:48:01.793 --> 00:48:02.809
suicide.
 

00:48:02.809 --> 00:48:07.280
Well, there's a final aspect
I'd like to raise in my last

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:10.438
minute,
and that is to say the defeat

00:48:10.438 --> 00:48:15.239
of anti-contagionism may have
had some negative legacies,

00:48:15.239 --> 00:48:18.268
that it took time to recognize.
 

00:48:18.268 --> 00:48:21.954
One of the strengths of
Pettenkofer's ideas was the

00:48:21.954 --> 00:48:26.599
stress they put on what we would
now call the environmental,

00:48:26.599 --> 00:48:31.469
social and economic
determinants of disease.

00:48:31.469 --> 00:48:36.148
For a time, the germ theory of
disease relegated those aspects

00:48:36.148 --> 00:48:40.521
of medicine to the background,
leading to a narrow-gauge

00:48:40.521 --> 00:48:44.373
stress on microbes,
and the attempt to find magic

00:48:44.373 --> 00:48:46.360
bullets to destroy them.
 

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:50.329
So, Pettenkofer then was
ultimately wrong.

00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:54.289
But I would argue that his
ideas were magnificently wrong,

00:48:54.289 --> 00:48:57.920
and that they contained
important elements of truth,

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:02.362
and important and vital
measures for public health and

00:49:02.362 --> 00:49:03.619
for medicine.
 

00:49:03.619 --> 00:49:08.492
Next time, we'll take the high
road and move on to the victors

00:49:08.492 --> 00:49:11.130
in this debate--
Pasteur, Koch,

00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:15.159
Lister--and the successful
proof of the truth of

00:49:15.159 --> 00:49:19.190
contagionism and the germ theory
of disease.

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:22.170
But I thought you needed a
moment with Max von.

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:28.000

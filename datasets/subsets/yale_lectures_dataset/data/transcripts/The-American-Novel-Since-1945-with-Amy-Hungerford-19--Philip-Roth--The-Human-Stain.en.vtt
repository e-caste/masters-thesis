00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:02.251
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Now,

00:00:02.251 --> 00:00:04.598
what's coming up?
As I mentioned last week,

00:00:04.598 --> 00:00:08.980
on Wednesday I'm going to give
my censorship lecture,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.505
and in preparation for that I
would like you to go to a local

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:19.064
bookstore, any one,
and just observe how it's laid

00:00:19.064 --> 00:00:23.175
out, what you see,
what your attention is called

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:26.013
to,
what your attention is not

00:00:26.013 --> 00:00:29.750
called to, and here's a
difficult question:

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.971
What isn't there?
Think about that,

00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:37.297
and I'll talk a little bit
about what isn't there on

00:00:37.297 --> 00:00:40.449
Wednesday.
Also, in order to keep up,

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.785
please try to read at least to
page 202--that's the next

00:00:44.785 --> 00:00:49.516
chapter division in The Human
Stain--so that you're on

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:54.010
track to finish it--it's 361
pages--for next Monday.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.145
And so, next Monday,
a week from today,

00:00:56.145 --> 00:00:59.180
I will give my second lecture
on The Human Stain.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.856
And I will talk about
The Human Stain a little

00:01:01.856 --> 00:01:04.103
bit on Wednesday,
because some of what I have to

00:01:04.103 --> 00:01:05.920
say about censorship does
pertain,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.880
so that's what's coming up.

00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:15.777
I hope you all thought
about the Identity Plot as you

00:01:15.777 --> 00:01:19.709
read this novel.
It's hard not to.

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:25.330
When I gave that lecture,
I suggested that when a genre

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.821
gains a certain credence,
a certain widespread use in the

00:01:30.821 --> 00:01:36.097
culture, it requires more and
more innovations on it to make a

00:01:36.097 --> 00:01:41.121
fresh story out of it.
It also gets us to the point

00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:47.354
where that set of conventions is
available to writers in a new

00:01:47.354 --> 00:01:51.340
way, to be transcended in a new
way.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.506
So, one thing that I want to
ask about this novel is,

00:01:55.506 --> 00:02:00.106
does it transcend the genre?
Does it do more than provide

00:02:00.106 --> 00:02:04.108
the certain dramas and
satisfactions that we come to

00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:07.090
expect from a novel about
identity?

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.583
In this sense,
because it is so deeply

00:02:10.583 --> 00:02:15.682
embedded in those kinds of
narratives, Roth is taking a

00:02:15.682 --> 00:02:20.261
kind of risk here.
He's playing it safe because he

00:02:20.261 --> 00:02:25.183
knows that this is a topic of
interest, but he's taking a risk

00:02:25.183 --> 00:02:29.459
as an artist because he's
working in very well-trodden

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.282
territory.
I suggested that,

00:02:32.282 --> 00:02:36.582
also, when a genre reaches a
certain point of saturation,

00:02:36.582 --> 00:02:39.500
writers tend to change the
subject.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.999
I didn't say this when we
talked about Blood

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:45.477
Meridian, but I think
in part Blood Meridian is

00:02:45.477 --> 00:02:49.672
that kind of change of subject.
So, this returns to the genre,

00:02:49.672 --> 00:02:53.569
and we want to ask what it's
doing with the genre.

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.288
Before I go in to my meditation
on that question today,

00:02:57.288 --> 00:03:00.868
I just want to call your
attention to another element

00:03:00.868 --> 00:03:04.379
that does relate back to
Blood Meridian,

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:10.569
 and that's its status
as a historical novel.

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.789
This novel places itself with
certain kinds of historical

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:19.718
markers at the very opening.
It was the summer of 1998,

00:03:19.718 --> 00:03:23.824
the summer of the Monica
Lewinsky affair,

00:03:23.824 --> 00:03:29.470
the summer when Viagra takes
off in the marketplace.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.780
Those are very contemporary
historical markers.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.241
Now, think back to the way
Blood Meridian opens with

00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:42.180
its historical markers.
Do you remember this line?

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.620
It's the father talking about
the kid's birth.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.450
He says, "Night of your birth,
'33.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.520
God, how the stars did fall."
I think I've got that correct.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.529
What he's talking about is the
Leonid meteor showers in 1833

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:05.009
that mark the night of the kid's
birth.

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:10.285
For all that McCarthy is
interested in--and mining--the

00:04:10.285 --> 00:04:17.566
historical detail of the 1830s,
'40s, '50s, that novel favors

00:04:17.566 --> 00:04:25.680
historical markers that seem
like cosmic markers of time.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.158
So, contrast the stars falling
in, yes, a historically specific

00:04:32.158 --> 00:04:36.759
meteor shower,
but nevertheless in something

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:41.910
that looks like a cosmic
communication of meaning.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.967
Contrast that with the
relatively mundane,

00:04:45.967 --> 00:04:50.321
debased historical markers that
Roth chooses,

00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:54.279
Viagra, the Monica Lewinsky
scandal.

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:58.997
You want to ask yourself,
what kind of history is each

00:04:58.997 --> 00:05:03.130
writer invoking?
I want to suggest to you

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.829
that if you press on the markers
that Roth chooses,

00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:12.235
you will find something more
than trivia, more than

00:05:12.235 --> 00:05:16.641
contemporary trivia,
that Roth has in his sights an

00:05:16.641 --> 00:05:21.573
equally universal,
trans-historical kind of truth

00:05:21.573 --> 00:05:25.565
in this novel,
that's brought up by those

00:05:25.565 --> 00:05:30.991
little details of history.
And that trans-historical

00:05:30.991 --> 00:05:36.258
history is the history of
desire, of which both those

00:05:36.258 --> 00:05:40.720
things are indicative.
I will say a lot more about

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.151
desire and its relationship to
the history of literature and to

00:05:45.151 --> 00:05:48.440
writing in this novel in my
Monday lecture,

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.988
but as you go on I would like
you to think about how history

00:05:53.988 --> 00:05:59.537
functions as a set of contexts
for the story that Roth tells

00:05:59.537 --> 00:06:02.308
you.
Now I want to talk about

00:06:02.308 --> 00:06:06.669
identity.
So, does this novel conform to

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:13.176
the form of the Identity Plot?
There are certain ways I think

00:06:13.176 --> 00:06:17.569
it does, and it does so in a
very explicit way.

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:23.747
Remember how I mentioned that
tension in the Identity Plot is

00:06:23.747 --> 00:06:29.616
produced by the individual's
relationship to the group and

00:06:29.616 --> 00:06:34.603
the way that's vexed.
It isn't a very exciting

00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:41.039
Identity Plot if the protagonist
just discovers that he or she is

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:45.564
whatever categorizable identity
and says, "Oh,

00:06:45.564 --> 00:06:49.940
good.
I'll be that," and then goes on.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.524
The tension comes from feeling
that either such an

00:06:53.524 --> 00:06:57.473
identification would be
coercion, or that it comes with

00:06:57.473 --> 00:07:00.180
all kinds of attendant
suffering.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.980
There are all kinds of tensions
that are produced in making that

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:10.713
not an easy identification,
and you can see that very

00:07:10.713 --> 00:07:19.735
explicitly in this novel on page
108--106,108--when Coleman talks

00:07:19.735 --> 00:07:24.810
about being at Howard
University,

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.517
and along with that,
the experience of being called

00:07:29.517 --> 00:07:33.840
a "nigger" for the first time.
This is on the top of 106: 

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:41.690
Especially when he began
to think that there was

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.600
something of the nigger about
him,

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.095
even to the kids in the dorm
who had all sorts of new

00:07:47.095 --> 00:07:49.649
clothes, and money in their
pockets,

00:07:49.649 --> 00:07:53.185
and in the summertime didn't
hang around the hot streets at

00:07:53.185 --> 00:07:56.590
home, but went to camp,
and not Boy Scout camp out in

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.508
the Jersey sticks,
but fancy places where they

00:07:59.508 --> 00:08:02.880
rode horses and played tennis
and acted in plays.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.740
What the hell was a cotillion?
Where was Highland Beach?

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.279
What were these kids talking
about?

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:12.468
He was among the very lightest
of the light-skinned in his

00:08:12.468 --> 00:08:14.481
freshman class,
lighter even than his

00:08:14.481 --> 00:08:17.531
tea-colored roommate,
but he could have been the

00:08:17.531 --> 00:08:21.404
blackest, most benighted field
hand, for all they knew that he

00:08:21.404 --> 00:08:24.047
didn't.
He hated Howard from the day he

00:08:24.047 --> 00:08:25.867
arrived.
Within a week he hated

00:08:25.867 --> 00:08:29.187
Washington, and so in early
October, when his father dropped

00:08:29.187 --> 00:08:32.450
dead serving dinner on the
Pennsylvania Railroad dining car

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.882
that was pulling out of 30^(th)
Street station in Philadelphia

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:38.969
for Wilmington,
and Coleman went home for the

00:08:38.969 --> 00:08:42.285
funeral, he told his mother he
was finished with that

00:08:42.285 --> 00:08:45.247
college.
Right there in that sentence,

00:08:45.247 --> 00:08:49.067
in this little set of scenes
about Howard and his experience

00:08:49.067 --> 00:08:52.317
in D.C.,
you see him at first being

00:08:52.317 --> 00:08:58.172
asked by his family to identify
with a certain version of the

00:08:58.172 --> 00:09:03.794
black middle class,
and then finding he is revolted

00:09:03.794 --> 00:09:08.950
by his own difference from that
middle class.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:13.624
He feels like a black field
hand, the darkest of the dark

00:09:13.624 --> 00:09:18.632
field hand, "for all they knew
that he didn't," and on 108 we

00:09:18.632 --> 00:09:23.032
get it in very abstract terms.
"You finally leave home,

00:09:23.032 --> 00:09:25.441
the Ur of we,
and you find another we,

00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:27.980
another place that's just like
that,

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.896
the substitute for
that."The problem of the

00:09:31.896 --> 00:09:36.580
Identity Plot is the problem of
the "I" and the "we."

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:41.072
Here is Coleman laying out
exactly how he feels about that,

00:09:41.072 --> 00:09:44.169
and so what he's going to favor
there,

00:09:44.169 --> 00:09:50.058
again on 108,
is the raw "I," all the

00:09:50.058 --> 00:09:58.472
subtlety of being Silky Silk.
So there you have encapsulated,

00:09:58.472 --> 00:10:04.401
in a very short amount of
prose, a major form--narrative

00:10:04.401 --> 00:10:10.870
form, narrative dynamic--of the
Identity Plot as a genre.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:18.425
On 144, you get another version
of that, slightly more

00:10:18.425 --> 00:10:24.210
personalized to his family.
This is another version of

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.940
identity and what Coleman thinks
about it.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:32.885
This is after we get the
history of Coleman's family,

00:10:32.885 --> 00:10:37.802
his ancestors,
and we're told that he is not

00:10:37.802 --> 00:10:45.005
the first to pass as white or to
disappear from the black family

00:10:45.005 --> 00:10:50.818
in to which he was born:
"Lost himself to all his

00:10:50.818 --> 00:10:54.600
people" was another way they,
the family, put it.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.470
Ancestor worship,
that's how Coleman put it.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:03.187
Honoring the past was one thing.
The idolatry that is ancestor

00:11:03.187 --> 00:11:07.138
worship was something else.
The hell with that

00:11:07.138 --> 00:11:12.099
imprisonment.
So, this version of identity on

00:11:12.099 --> 00:11:17.724
144, this vision of it,
is identity as ancestor worship

00:11:17.724 --> 00:11:24.866
and imprisonment in that family,
imprisonment in that way of

00:11:24.866 --> 00:11:31.798
thinking, a radical un-freedom.
So, this is one version of

00:11:31.798 --> 00:11:38.126
identity, radically individual,
rising out of the difference

00:11:38.126 --> 00:11:44.347
that you feel from the various
"we" groups you are asked to

00:11:44.347 --> 00:11:47.913
join.
But there are other versions of

00:11:47.913 --> 00:11:52.820
identity that are imagined here,
and they track pretty clearly

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:57.485
with scholarly ways of thinking
about identity at this same

00:11:57.485 --> 00:12:00.322
time.
So, in one sense identity

00:12:00.322 --> 00:12:04.317
is this radical individual
humanist version that I've been

00:12:04.317 --> 00:12:10.499
tracing in the last few minutes.
Another is that identity is a

00:12:10.499 --> 00:12:18.860
constantly changing performance,
and we get that too in Coleman.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:24.636
You see it, again,
right in the section about

00:12:24.636 --> 00:12:29.887
Howard on 109,
and I want you to note the

00:12:29.887 --> 00:12:36.075
words that Roth chooses here,
109 in the middle:

00:12:36.075 --> 00:12:42.569
"He could play his skin however
he wanted, color himself just as

00:12:42.569 --> 00:12:45.634
he chose."
"Play his skin any way he

00:12:45.634 --> 00:12:48.186
wanted."
Now, remember that his father

00:12:48.186 --> 00:12:51.314
is a great devotee of
Shakespeare and tries to

00:12:51.314 --> 00:12:55.204
communicate to his children,
not only through their

00:12:55.204 --> 00:12:59.226
Shakespearian middle names,
but through every verbal

00:12:59.226 --> 00:13:03.930
interaction he has with them,
that the grandeur of the

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:09.473
English language will somehow
fill them and make them who they

00:13:09.473 --> 00:13:12.440
are,
that this is the source of

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:19.466
their dignity and their power.
He takes that lesson and

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:25.199
transforms it.
It's about playing on the model

00:13:25.199 --> 00:13:31.359
of drama, but it's about playing
color, and this is an artist's

00:13:31.359 --> 00:13:35.929
vocation, "color himself just as
he chose."

00:13:35.929 --> 00:13:38.769
He's like a painter,
in this sense,

00:13:38.769 --> 00:13:41.860
so this is identity as
performance.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.850
There are many instances of
this.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:51.221
On page 115,116,
there is just a little

00:13:51.221 --> 00:13:58.600
description of Steena's dance
for Coleman.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.270
I'm going to just read a little
bit of it.

00:14:08.549 --> 00:14:11.008
All at once,
with no prompting from him,

00:14:11.008 --> 00:14:13.629
seemingly prompted only by
Eldridge's trumpet,

00:14:13.629 --> 00:14:16.447
she began what Coleman liked to
describe as the single most

00:14:16.447 --> 00:14:19.313
slithery dance ever performed by
a Fergus Falls girl after a

00:14:19.313 --> 00:14:21.500
little more than a year in New
York City.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.003
She could have raised Gershwin
himself from the grave with that

00:14:25.003 --> 00:14:27.490
dance, and with the way she sang
the song,

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.816
prompted by a colored trumpet
player playing it like a black

00:14:30.816 --> 00:14:32.596
torch song.
There to see,

00:14:32.596 --> 00:14:35.573
plain as day,
was all the power of her

00:14:35.573 --> 00:14:38.470
whiteness, that big,
white thing.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.097
"Someday he'll come along,
the man I love,

00:14:41.097 --> 00:14:44.110
and he'll be big and strong,
the man I love."

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.974
The language was ordinary
enough to have been lifted from

00:14:46.974 --> 00:14:48.970
the most innocent first-grade
primer,

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:52.132
but when the record was over,
Steena put her hands up to hide

00:14:52.132 --> 00:14:55.362
her face, half meaning,
half pretending,

00:14:55.362 --> 00:15:01.131
to cover her shame.
The history of jazz that's

00:15:01.131 --> 00:15:06.454
concentrated in to that tiny,
little passage has been

00:15:06.454 --> 00:15:12.289
unpacked by a critic by the name
of Jonathan Freedman.

00:15:12.289 --> 00:15:17.599
He does a whole history,
which I can't produce here,

00:15:17.599 --> 00:15:23.429
of how Artie Shaw and various
players played Gershwin,

00:15:23.429 --> 00:15:27.273
and used black musicians in
their ensembles,

00:15:27.273 --> 00:15:30.759
and how this very dance,
when Steena,

00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:35.519
here, we're told,
in a way, inhabits most fully

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:40.071
her whiteness,
she does that by performing to

00:15:40.071 --> 00:15:43.900
a music that is radically
hybrid,

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:50.532
black and Jewish.
So, Freedman argues that in

00:15:50.532 --> 00:15:57.350
this passage we get identity as
a vision of absolute fluidity,

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:02.103
absolute performance and
fluidity, and that the whole

00:16:02.103 --> 00:16:07.680
history of American jazz stands
behind that imagined state.

00:16:11.049 --> 00:16:17.518
It's the very difference
between the hybrid music and the

00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:23.641
pure whiteness of Steena's body
that creates what's so

00:16:23.641 --> 00:16:29.111
provocative to Coleman,
the spectacle of whiteness in

00:16:29.111 --> 00:16:31.220
the context of hybridity.

00:16:37.549 --> 00:16:42.725
The father's obsession with
the English language,

00:16:42.725 --> 00:16:48.299
though, has taught Coleman to
categorize relentlessly.

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:51.100
Do you remember this little
detail?

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:59.106
This is on page 93 when Coleman
is describing or we're having

00:16:59.106 --> 00:17:06.845
described to us exactly how
Coleman's father taught them to

00:17:06.845 --> 00:17:09.170
speak.
This is on 93.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:11.789
Growing up they never
said, "See the bow-wow."

00:17:11.789 --> 00:17:14.260
They didn't even say,
"See the doggie."

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.590
They said, "See the Doberman.
See the beagle.

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:21.881
See the terrier."
They learned things had

00:17:21.881 --> 00:17:25.970
classifications.
They learned the power of

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:31.948
naming precisely."
The father, for all that he is

00:17:31.948 --> 00:17:37.964
imbuing them with the most elite
version of a white literary

00:17:37.964 --> 00:17:40.567
tradition,
Shakespeare,

00:17:40.567 --> 00:17:45.144
he is also teaching them
relentlessly to see

00:17:45.144 --> 00:17:53.503
classification and categorizing.
In Coleman this comes to mean

00:17:53.503 --> 00:18:02.292
something quite different,
and you see it in this funny,

00:18:02.292 --> 00:18:11.559
little passing moment on 107,
the very top of the page.

00:18:11.559 --> 00:18:14.780
This is talking about his
father's cherished volume of

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.635
Shakespeare's plays,
the oversized book with the

00:18:17.635 --> 00:18:22.678
floppy leather binding that,
when Coleman was a small boy,

00:18:22.678 --> 00:18:27.059
always reminded him of a cocker
spaniel.

00:18:27.059 --> 00:18:29.623
The son felt his father's
majesty as never before,

00:18:29.623 --> 00:18:31.720
the grandeur of both his rise
and his fall,

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.175
the grandeur that as a college
freshman away for barely a

00:18:35.175 --> 00:18:37.952
month.--[And then it quotes from
Shakespeare.]

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:42.853
The cocker spaniel: Why?
Why choose that as what the

00:18:42.853 --> 00:18:47.930
little boy thinks of when he
looks at that floppy volume?

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:52.008
It's a moment when being
trained to classify and to

00:18:52.008 --> 00:18:56.658
categorize causes him to see the
source of that linguistic

00:18:56.658 --> 00:19:00.600
precision,
the book of Shakespeare,

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:06.901
in very demeaning terms,
or reductive terms or--I'm not

00:19:06.901 --> 00:19:14.019
getting quite the precise word I
want--in deflating terms.

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:19.565
So that, instead of grandeur,
the book of Shakespeare becomes

00:19:19.565 --> 00:19:22.799
the source for the names of
dogs.

00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:29.660
And the way the child's
imagination blends grandeur and

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.710
the ordinary,
I think,

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:38.063
gives us Coleman,
who can imagine the details of

00:19:38.063 --> 00:19:42.050
everyday life,
the life he lives,

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.140
as a grand play.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:54.666
Doc Chizner furthers this
transformation of the father's

00:19:54.666 --> 00:19:59.660
lesson in this very crucial
passage,

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:04.326
that I'm going to talk more
about later, when Coleman passes

00:20:04.326 --> 00:20:07.490
as white or Jewish for the first
time.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:12.420
And that's when he's boxing for
the pit coach:

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.846
"If nothing comes up,"
Doc said [this is the bottom of

00:20:15.846 --> 00:20:17.529
98]
"you don't bring it up.

00:20:17.529 --> 00:20:19.840
You're neither one thing or the
other.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.520
You're Silky Silk.
That's enough.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.418
That's the deal."
"You're neither one thing or

00:20:28.418 --> 00:20:31.420
the other.
You're Silky Silk."

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:36.180
This takes the question of
categorization--are you colored?

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:40.686
Are you not?--it negates it:
you're neither one thing nor

00:20:40.686 --> 00:20:44.789
another, but then reinstates it
in a different mode:

00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:49.376
you're Silky Silk.
Make up a new category for

00:20:49.376 --> 00:20:52.769
yourself.
So, Doc Chizner takes that

00:20:52.769 --> 00:20:57.655
transgressing use of precision
that we see in the cocker

00:20:57.655 --> 00:21:01.829
spaniel metaphor in the child's
imagination,

00:21:01.829 --> 00:21:07.678
and he shows Coleman how to
apply that to living race in

00:21:07.678 --> 00:21:11.720
America, living his race in
America.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.069
You are Silky Silk.
You're not a race.

00:21:14.069 --> 00:21:18.956
You're a proper name,
the irreducible singularity of

00:21:18.956 --> 00:21:20.010
a person.

00:21:27.529 --> 00:21:31.060
There is a third way of
thinking about race,

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.839
and that, of course,
is as biology.

00:21:33.839 --> 00:21:36.730
That, too, is present in this
novel.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.272
The body is relentlessly
present, and I hope that you

00:21:39.272 --> 00:21:42.099
picked up on that.
It's not hard to pick up on it.

00:21:42.099 --> 00:21:47.890
The very matter and specificity
of the body is everywhere in

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:53.190
this novel, and so I want to
look back at 21 and 22.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:59.510
This is in that wonderful scene
when Coleman dances with Nathan.

00:22:10.309 --> 00:22:15.348
So, we get a whole description
of Coleman's body and what it is

00:22:15.348 --> 00:22:19.248
that Nathan sees in it,
suddenly, now that he's

00:22:19.248 --> 00:22:23.959
shirtless on this hot summer
night, and also now that he is

00:22:23.959 --> 00:22:27.940
no longer talking about the
"spooks" business.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.140
This is 21.
On display were the

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:38.427
shoulders, arms and chest of a
smallish man still trim and

00:22:38.427 --> 00:22:40.977
attractive,
a belly no longer flat,

00:22:40.977 --> 00:22:44.559
to be sure, but nothing that
had gotten seriously out of

00:22:44.559 --> 00:22:46.736
hand,
altogether the physique of

00:22:46.736 --> 00:22:50.112
someone who had seemed to have
been a cunning and wily

00:22:50.112 --> 00:22:53.680
competitor at sports rather than
an overpowering one.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.059
And all of this had previously
been concealed from me,

00:22:57.059 --> 00:23:02.365
because he was always shirted,
and also because of his having

00:23:02.365 --> 00:23:07.589
been so drastically consumed by
his rage.

00:23:07.589 --> 00:23:11.844
What you see there is the
revelation of certain things we

00:23:11.844 --> 00:23:14.960
will find out to be true about
Coleman,

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:22.228
that he was a cunning and wily
competitor rather than an

00:23:22.228 --> 00:23:27.646
overpowering one,
that he is still fit and

00:23:27.646 --> 00:23:31.877
virile,
that he has himself in hand,

00:23:31.877 --> 00:23:37.829
nothing that had gotten out of
hand, seriously out of hand.

00:23:37.829 --> 00:23:41.220
Coleman very much still has
himself in hand.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:47.041
He is still the maker of
himself, the presenter of

00:23:47.041 --> 00:23:52.150
himself to the world in a
deliberate way.

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:55.852
But then we go on,
and there are some things that

00:23:55.852 --> 00:23:59.710
we see that perhaps tell us
something different.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:04.735
Rather than the body revealing
the truth about Coleman--

00:24:04.735 --> 00:24:08.750
certain kinds of truth,
not a racial truth,

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:13.851
other kinds of truth--we see
marks on his body that don't

00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:18.437
produce that knowledge.
Also previously concealed

00:24:18.437 --> 00:24:21.657
was the small,
Popeye-ish blue tattoo situated

00:24:21.657 --> 00:24:25.950
at the top of his right arm just
at the shoulder joining,

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:28.820
the words "U.S.
Navy" inscribed between the

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.516
hooklike arms of a shadowy
little anchor and running along

00:24:32.516 --> 00:24:35.109
the hypotenuse of the deltoid
muscle,

00:24:35.109 --> 00:24:39.239
a tiny symbol if one were
needed of all the million

00:24:39.239 --> 00:24:42.789
circumstances of the other
fellow's life,

00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:46.688
of that blizzard of details
that constitute the confusion of

00:24:46.688 --> 00:24:50.283
a human biography,
a tiny symbol to remind me why

00:24:50.283 --> 00:24:54.300
our understanding of people must
always be, at best,

00:24:54.300 --> 00:25:00.656
slightly wrong.
What's revealed when Coleman is

00:25:00.656 --> 00:25:06.179
shirtless is the very sign that
he cannot be known in any kind

00:25:06.179 --> 00:25:10.042
of complete way.
It's the mark of a history on

00:25:10.042 --> 00:25:14.252
his body, that he was in the
navy, a history we'll learn a

00:25:14.252 --> 00:25:17.400
little bit about,
but not a lot,

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:24.202
but for Nathan it is the mark
of an irreducible difference

00:25:24.202 --> 00:25:29.527
between persons,
that always there are details

00:25:29.527 --> 00:25:34.797
that are not accessible,
circumstances of the other

00:25:34.797 --> 00:25:36.590
fellow's life.

00:25:40.779 --> 00:25:47.397
In this moment Nathan
recognizes Coleman as a cipher,

00:25:47.397 --> 00:25:55.160
a sign that can be projected
upon with meanings of his own.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.616
I would suggest to you that we
don't see the full flowering of

00:25:58.616 --> 00:26:01.109
this until quite a bit later in
the novel,

00:26:01.109 --> 00:26:04.899
but I think this is the first
moment where,

00:26:04.899 --> 00:26:09.861
in Coleman revealing his body,
he suggests to Nathan the

00:26:09.861 --> 00:26:13.559
possibilities of that body as a
sign.

00:26:13.559 --> 00:26:17.295
So, he is no longer,
in this moment,

00:26:17.295 --> 00:26:22.765
entirely "in hand" anymore.
So, if his physique hasn't

00:26:22.765 --> 00:26:26.786
gotten out of hand,
his circulation as a sign

00:26:26.786 --> 00:26:30.242
certainly has.
In this case,

00:26:30.242 --> 00:26:36.829
he has now become a blank
canvas for Nathan.

00:26:36.829 --> 00:26:41.236
Certainly, up until this moment
at the beginning of the novel,

00:26:41.236 --> 00:26:45.426
what's most on the surface of
the plot is how he has become

00:26:45.426 --> 00:26:49.911
the victim of rumor,
how his self-presentation got

00:26:49.911 --> 00:26:54.749
completely out of hand,
taken over by other people's

00:26:54.749 --> 00:27:01.090
erroneous readings of his words.
So, if the body seems to be in

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:05.519
his control, himself as a
signifier is not.

00:27:05.519 --> 00:27:09.658
Here Nathan is invited into it,
but in a very different way

00:27:09.658 --> 00:27:13.582
than the rumormongers who
surround him at Athena College

00:27:13.582 --> 00:27:15.010
and in the town.

00:27:19.109 --> 00:27:23.039
So, the body is not going to be
a place of revelation.

00:27:23.039 --> 00:27:27.163
Speech, as I've noted,
is a problematic moment of

00:27:27.163 --> 00:27:31.188
revelation, but it can be that.
And on 81,82,

00:27:31.188 --> 00:27:37.905
we see an example of that when
his speech formally in the novel

00:27:37.905 --> 00:27:44.514
touches off what will be some of
the most important revelatory

00:27:44.514 --> 00:27:51.280
passages in the novel.
And this is when Nelson Primus,

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:57.970
having berated Coleman and
advised him in his clever,

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:02.867
authoritative,
arrogant way not to pursue

00:28:02.867 --> 00:28:08.990
anything against Lester Farley
or Delphine Roux,

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:14.738
has offended him and enraged
him so much as to become the

00:28:14.738 --> 00:28:18.503
target of Coleman's rage.
Coleman said,

00:28:18.503 --> 00:28:22.632
"I never again want to hear
that self-admiring voice of

00:28:22.632 --> 00:28:27.215
yours or see your smug,
fucking, lily-white face," and

00:28:27.215 --> 00:28:32.233
the question becomes why--and we
see Nelson ask it the next

00:28:32.233 --> 00:28:38.057
page--why "white,"
why does "lily-white" become

00:28:38.057 --> 00:28:43.210
the insult that he hurls at
Nelson?

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:46.949
And formally,
even though there's a little

00:28:46.949 --> 00:28:52.239
bit of an interlude here about
Athena College and Coleman's

00:28:52.239 --> 00:28:54.959
rage,
this is the moment when we

00:28:54.959 --> 00:28:58.099
launch into the tale of
Coleman's childhood,

00:28:58.099 --> 00:29:02.409
and we learn for the first time
what kind of family he comes

00:29:02.409 --> 00:29:05.947
from,
and what the history of his

00:29:05.947 --> 00:29:10.626
passing has been,
how he made that decision to

00:29:10.626 --> 00:29:15.985
abandon his family of birth.
So, speech can be

00:29:15.985 --> 00:29:21.374
revealing, but only in those
moments when it is out of

00:29:21.374 --> 00:29:25.410
Coleman's control.
Here, in this moment,

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:28.849
"lily-white" is inspired by his
rage.

00:29:28.849 --> 00:29:31.382
He is out of control,
in that sense,

00:29:31.382 --> 00:29:34.421
and of course,
"lily white" is the term his

00:29:34.421 --> 00:29:37.476
brother,
Walt, applies to him in a

00:29:37.476 --> 00:29:42.024
similar moment of anger,
after Walt discovers that he

00:29:42.024 --> 00:29:47.272
has told his mother that he is
essentially estranging himself

00:29:47.272 --> 00:29:52.170
permanently from the family in
order to marry Iris.

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:58.350
Walt says, "Don't ever show
your lily-white face here

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:01.497
again."
So, he's reproducing Walt's

00:30:01.497 --> 00:30:04.575
language, and,
from that, it indicates to

00:30:04.575 --> 00:30:08.344
Nelson Primus and for us,
in the unfolding of the novel,

00:30:08.344 --> 00:30:10.549
that there is a mystery here to
be told.

00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:13.289
And then we get the telling of
that mystery.

00:30:13.289 --> 00:30:18.559
So, from that little word,
all of this unfurls,

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:22.564
and I would just note,
just in passing,

00:30:22.564 --> 00:30:27.940
that this is quite a contrast
to Delphine Roux.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.438
On 38 and 39,
you can look at:

00:30:30.438 --> 00:30:35.608
Coleman is very surprised that
she has made no effort to hide

00:30:35.608 --> 00:30:39.829
the identifying marks of her own
handwriting.

00:30:39.829 --> 00:30:45.748
Delphine Roux--though her name
suggests the Delphic,

00:30:45.748 --> 00:30:48.998
the oracular,
the mysterious,

00:30:48.998 --> 00:30:56.309
the secret--Delphine is someone
who cannot conceal herself.

00:30:56.309 --> 00:31:01.241
The very material of her
language, of her writing,

00:31:01.241 --> 00:31:05.670
of her letters,
puts her identity on the page

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:09.821
to be read,
and it seems as if she hasn't

00:31:09.821 --> 00:31:15.412
even tried to conceal it.
So, Delphine's lack of depth,

00:31:15.412 --> 00:31:20.634
her lack of complexity as a
character, her basic

00:31:20.634 --> 00:31:26.745
despicableness is summed up in
that inability to conceal

00:31:26.745 --> 00:31:31.035
herself,
whereas Coleman only reveals

00:31:31.035 --> 00:31:36.523
himself in moments when he is
unguarded, or when he has

00:31:36.523 --> 00:31:40.151
become,
not a person in control of his

00:31:40.151 --> 00:31:45.026
own representation of himself,
but rather a sign at large

00:31:45.026 --> 00:31:48.160
among other representers
(Nathan,

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.600
Delphine, other people).

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:57.149
Secrecy,
then, is at the very heart of

00:31:57.149 --> 00:32:02.381
what identity means in this
novel, and now I want to get to

00:32:02.381 --> 00:32:05.720
this crucial passage on page
100.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:13.185
For me, this is where we learn
really what identity means in

00:32:13.185 --> 00:32:14.830
this novel.

00:32:23.839 --> 00:32:30.602
So, he says he wants to be in
this fight with--in front of the

00:32:30.602 --> 00:32:34.150
Pitt coach--with Ray Robinson.

00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:39.965
It wasn't just that [This
is on 99.]

00:32:39.965 --> 00:32:43.378
It wasn't just that Coleman
weighed some seven pounds more

00:32:43.378 --> 00:32:46.791
than when he'd boxed on the
amateur card at the Knights of

00:32:46.791 --> 00:32:49.620
Pythias.
It was that something he could

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:53.668
not even name made him want to
be more damaging than he'd ever

00:32:53.668 --> 00:32:56.785
dared before,
to do something more that day

00:32:56.785 --> 00:33:00.734
than merely win.
Was it because the pit coach

00:33:00.734 --> 00:33:06.650
didn't know he was colored?
Could it be because who he

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:11.039
really was was entirely his
secret?

00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:14.624
He did love secrets,
the secret of nobody's knowing

00:33:14.624 --> 00:33:19.228
what was going on in your head,
thinking whatever you wanted to

00:33:19.228 --> 00:33:22.190
think, with no way of anybody's
knowing.

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:25.521
All the other kids were always
blabbing about themselves,

00:33:25.521 --> 00:33:29.210
but that wasn't where the power
was, or the pleasure either.

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:32.992
The power and the pleasure were
to be found in the opposite,

00:33:32.992 --> 00:33:36.517
in being counter-confessional
in the same way you were a

00:33:36.517 --> 00:33:39.750
counter-puncher,
and he knew that with nobody

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:44.000
having to tell him and without
his having to think about it.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.676
That's why he liked shadow
boxing and hitting the heavy

00:33:47.676 --> 00:33:50.059
bag, for the secrecy of
it.

00:33:50.059 --> 00:33:53.250
And I'm going to skip down a
little bit.

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:58.787
He talks about concentrating,
and how the secrecy is produced

00:33:58.787 --> 00:34:01.947
by the concentration,
or is related to the

00:34:01.947 --> 00:34:04.540
concentration on the one thing
that you're doing.

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:10.719
Whatever is to be
mastered, he becomes that thing.

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:14.337
He could do that in biology,
and he could do it in the dash,

00:34:14.337 --> 00:34:17.586
and he could do it in boxing,
and not only did nothing

00:34:17.586 --> 00:34:20.687
external make any difference;
neither did anything

00:34:20.687 --> 00:34:21.550
internal.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:29.070
That little example right
there: He could do it in

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:34.127
biology, on a biology exam he
could focus exclusively on that

00:34:34.127 --> 00:34:37.238
thing,
become that thing,

00:34:37.238 --> 00:34:41.523
in the dash,
in boxing in the ring,

00:34:41.523 --> 00:34:47.020
but why choose that example?
Why not mathematics?

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:51.320
Why not chemistry?
Well, here again,

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.960
it's Roth's craft coming
through.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:02.202
Roth chose that because what
Coleman does is precisely to

00:35:02.202 --> 00:35:07.396
overcome biology.
It's the biology of who his

00:35:07.396 --> 00:35:11.349
parents are, of who their
parents are.

00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:16.320
That biology,
the biology of American race,

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:21.290
is what he takes hold of and
transforms.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:26.851
It becomes his secret.
Biology becomes his secret,

00:35:26.851 --> 00:35:32.130
not as an academic subject,
but as a lived experience.

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:35.352
Boxing is the sport of
concealment for him,

00:35:35.352 --> 00:35:38.267
thinking ahead,
observing his opponent,

00:35:38.267 --> 00:35:41.030
watching how slow the punch is:

00:35:45.949 --> 00:35:48.241
All the answers that you
came up with in the ring,

00:35:48.241 --> 00:35:51.068
you kept to yourself,
and when you let the secret

00:35:51.068 --> 00:35:55.289
out, you let it out through
everything but your mouth.

00:35:55.289 --> 00:36:00.780
For all Coleman's training in
the English language from his

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:06.176
father, his mode of revelation,
his mode of communication,

00:36:06.176 --> 00:36:10.003
is not verbal.
It is somehow physical,

00:36:10.003 --> 00:36:14.435
as a physical performance,
as a damaging physical

00:36:14.435 --> 00:36:15.820
performance.

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:23.601
That term
"counter-confessional,"

00:36:23.601 --> 00:36:26.923
being--the pleasure and the
power were in--being

00:36:26.923 --> 00:36:31.730
counter-confessional in the same
way you were a counter-puncher,

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:38.909
in not telling--this is quite a
remarkable term for Roth to use.

00:36:38.909 --> 00:36:44.467
The history of Roth's writing
from the very first story

00:36:44.467 --> 00:36:50.357
collection, Goodbye,
Columbus published in 1960,

00:36:50.357 --> 00:36:55.172
through the many,
many novels in the next five

00:36:55.172 --> 00:36:57.486
decades,
that trajectory,

00:36:57.486 --> 00:37:01.394
which I'm going to talk a
little bit about on Wednesday,

00:37:01.394 --> 00:37:05.231
is defined by the confessional
quality of many of these

00:37:05.231 --> 00:37:08.703
works.So,
Roth is widely known for

00:37:08.703 --> 00:37:14.186
drawing on his own life in his
fiction, and for making Nathan

00:37:14.186 --> 00:37:19.030
Zuckerman track his biography in
significant ways.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:22.836
And, in this novel,
it happens to be true that

00:37:22.836 --> 00:37:27.489
Philip Roth went through
prostate cancer surgery and now

00:37:27.489 --> 00:37:32.650
lives up in the Berkshires and
has been very secluded up there

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:37.980
and very productive writing
novels in the last ten years.

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:42.450
So, in this novel already,
anybody who knows even those

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:46.507
basic facts knows that Roth
himself as a writer is

00:37:46.507 --> 00:37:50.150
confessional,
in some sense of the word.

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:53.387
One question we might want to
ask is: is he

00:37:53.387 --> 00:37:57.010
counter-confessional the way
that Coleman is,

00:37:57.010 --> 00:38:00.348
the way that you can be a
counter-puncher,

00:38:00.348 --> 00:38:03.280
and what would it mean to be
that?

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.239
Why does it matter?
In fact, does it matter?

00:38:08.239 --> 00:38:12.090
And then, why does it matter,
if it does, that his novels

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:15.136
track his life?
This is a long-term question

00:38:15.136 --> 00:38:17.951
for anyone who thinks about
Roth's writing,

00:38:17.951 --> 00:38:22.040
and I will get more to it in my
second lecture on The Human

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:26.438
Stain next Monday,
but it's something to think

00:38:26.438 --> 00:38:29.173
about.
But let me pause,

00:38:29.173 --> 00:38:32.710
again, on that rhetorical
question.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.829
"Was it because the pit coach
didn't know he was colored?

00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:40.717
Could it be because who he
really was was entirely his

00:38:40.717 --> 00:38:43.498
secret?"
There are two ways of reading

00:38:43.498 --> 00:38:46.639
that last question.
"Who he really was was

00:38:46.639 --> 00:38:50.255
entirely his secret."
If we read that,

00:38:50.255 --> 00:38:57.559
"who he really was" as a
colored guy from East Orange,

00:38:57.559 --> 00:39:03.900
then we'll see it as that being
his secret.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:07.074
But you can read it,
you can parse that grammar,

00:39:07.074 --> 00:39:11.507
a different way.
"Who he really was was his

00:39:11.507 --> 00:39:15.578
secret."
Could it be because who he

00:39:15.578 --> 00:39:20.936
really was was "his secret,"
secrecy as the essence of

00:39:20.936 --> 00:39:24.217
identity?
It doesn't matter what's in

00:39:24.217 --> 00:39:27.913
that hidden box.
It doesn't mean that we have to

00:39:27.913 --> 00:39:29.690
fill it in.
It doesn't mean,

00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:33.549
even, that it can be known.
And you think back to the way

00:39:33.549 --> 00:39:37.144
the anchor on his arm,
the tattoo on his arm,

00:39:37.144 --> 00:39:41.639
reminds Nathan of how little
you can ever know about the

00:39:41.639 --> 00:39:45.011
other fellow.
The very fact of the person's

00:39:45.011 --> 00:39:48.485
other-ness to you means that
there is always something

00:39:48.485 --> 00:39:53.405
fundamentally hidden about them,
and that arises from the simple

00:39:53.405 --> 00:39:57.639
difference between one
consciousness and another.

00:39:57.639 --> 00:40:04.349
This returns the meditation
on identity to a universalist,

00:40:04.349 --> 00:40:09.300
humanist version of what
identity would be.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.940
It's simply private
consciousness.

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:17.236
Private consciousness is what
defines us as persons,

00:40:17.236 --> 00:40:20.269
and then, radiating out from
that,

00:40:20.269 --> 00:40:24.458
all the things that one can do
with a private consciousness,

00:40:24.458 --> 00:40:28.646
which then encompasses these
other modes of identifying that

00:40:28.646 --> 00:40:33.987
the novel rehearses,
and then critiques or sometimes

00:40:33.987 --> 00:40:38.680
endorses, plays with,
jumbles, juggles.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:42.650
We have a private consciousness.
You can decide to decide.

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:46.411
This is something that Coleman
does on a number of occasions,

00:40:46.411 --> 00:40:49.923
and it's a phrase that Roth
repeats when he's deciding to

00:40:49.923 --> 00:40:52.869
decide to be done with the
spooks business,

00:40:52.869 --> 00:40:56.160
deciding to decide not to be
worried about Lester Farley.

00:40:59.559 --> 00:41:04.929
You have the power to form your
self-presentation.

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:08.845
You have the power to make your
identity an artistic

00:41:08.845 --> 00:41:11.896
performance.
That's what private

00:41:11.896 --> 00:41:17.409
consciousness does for you,
but it does a couple other

00:41:17.409 --> 00:41:20.608
things,
too, and I want to track those,

00:41:20.608 --> 00:41:24.019
or suggest them just briefly
before I end today,

00:41:24.019 --> 00:41:27.165
in one sense by following the
theme of difference,

00:41:27.165 --> 00:41:30.761
and in the other sense by
following the word "secrecy" in

00:41:30.761 --> 00:41:34.963
the novel.
First, on the question of

00:41:34.963 --> 00:41:40.204
pure difference,
on 47, in that wonderful scene

00:41:40.204 --> 00:41:43.280
of Faunia with the cows,

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:53.215
this is Nathan reflecting on
the desire that he sees enacted

00:41:53.215 --> 00:41:56.214
there.
And again, remember,

00:41:56.214 --> 00:42:03.610
Coleman is not primarily a man
of words, but a man of being,

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:08.095
and he has just stood in
silence with Nathan watching

00:42:08.095 --> 00:42:10.080
Faunia milk the cows.

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:22.575
It was enough to be able
to conduct themselves like two

00:42:22.575 --> 00:42:25.500
people who had nothing
whatsoever in common,

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:29.205
all the while remembering how
they could distill to an

00:42:29.205 --> 00:42:32.421
orgasmic essence everything
about them that was

00:42:32.421 --> 00:42:36.135
irreconcilable,
the human discrepancies that

00:42:36.135 --> 00:42:40.109
produced all the power.
It was enough to feel the

00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:43.119
thrill of leading a double
life.

00:42:43.119 --> 00:42:46.991
And what this passage,
the sentences above,

00:42:46.991 --> 00:42:51.969
emphasize, is that Faunia is a
woman of thirty-four,

00:42:51.969 --> 00:42:57.154
a "wordless illiterate," and
that Coleman is a man replete

00:42:57.154 --> 00:43:01.429
with the vocabularies of two
ancient tongues,

00:43:01.429 --> 00:43:05.269
as well as his own native
tongue.

00:43:05.269 --> 00:43:09.775
So, the very difference between
them, this time limned in terms

00:43:09.775 --> 00:43:14.003
of education and language,
vocabulary, literacy,

00:43:14.003 --> 00:43:19.955
here it's that difference that
is invoked as the engine of

00:43:19.955 --> 00:43:23.601
desire.
So, if desire is always that

00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:29.269
looking towards the other thing,
the thing that you are not,

00:43:29.269 --> 00:43:33.900
the thing that you do not have,
the thing that is absent from

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.909
you: that's the definition of
desire.

00:43:36.909 --> 00:43:41.360
You can't have desire if you
already have the thing.

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:46.039
Desire is that force that's
always reaching toward something

00:43:46.039 --> 00:43:52.122
that is separate from you.
Difference between human beings

00:43:52.122 --> 00:43:55.486
is just that,
in this scene,

00:43:55.486 --> 00:44:00.002
just the engine of desire.
So, here,

00:44:00.002 --> 00:44:04.027
for all the meditations on
race, the social construction of

00:44:04.027 --> 00:44:07.420
race, race as performance,
race as essence,

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.094
race as biology,
race as secret,

00:44:10.094 --> 00:44:15.357
it's secret that gets to that
over-arching concern with desire

00:44:15.357 --> 00:44:19.277
in the novel.
And this is a moment where I

00:44:19.277 --> 00:44:22.489
think Roth is transcending the
genre.

00:44:22.489 --> 00:44:27.721
He's taking the dramas of the
Identity Plot,

00:44:27.721 --> 00:44:34.900
and he's driving them to an
extreme and pushing them over in

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:40.573
to another subject matter.
So, in this sense,

00:44:40.573 --> 00:44:47.431
identity as secrecy pushes us
over in to the subject matter of

00:44:47.431 --> 00:44:53.360
desire and mortality,
which is at the heart of Roth's

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:58.364
writing from beginning to end.
Now, I will not say that

00:44:58.364 --> 00:45:02.726
identity is not also a subject
matter he's working with from

00:45:02.726 --> 00:45:06.756
beginning to end of his career.
That's definitely true,

00:45:06.756 --> 00:45:10.843
and I'll say more about that on
Wednesday when I talk about the

00:45:10.843 --> 00:45:14.967
shape of his career.
But especially as Roth moves

00:45:14.967 --> 00:45:19.437
later in his career these
questions of desire and

00:45:19.437 --> 00:45:26.079
mortality take the upper hand.
Now, the last thing I want

00:45:26.079 --> 00:45:31.433
to do, just very quickly,
is point to page 44,

00:45:31.433 --> 00:45:37.740
another use of that word
"secret," the very top of the

00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:40.648
page.
The secret to living in

00:45:40.648 --> 00:45:43.966
the rush of the world with a
minimum of pain is to get as

00:45:43.966 --> 00:45:46.811
many people as possible to
string along with your

00:45:46.811 --> 00:45:49.236
delusions.
The trick of living alone up

00:45:49.236 --> 00:45:51.596
here, away from all agitating
entanglements,

00:45:51.596 --> 00:45:53.729
allurements,
and expectations,

00:45:53.729 --> 00:45:58.352
apart especially from one's own
intensity, is to organize the

00:45:58.352 --> 00:46:01.121
silence,
to think of its mountaintop

00:46:01.121 --> 00:46:04.823
plenitude as capital,
silence as wealth exponentially

00:46:04.823 --> 00:46:08.116
increasing,
the encircling silence as your

00:46:08.116 --> 00:46:12.019
chosen source of advantage and
your only intimate.

00:46:12.019 --> 00:46:15.253
The trick is to find
sustenance, this is quoting

00:46:15.253 --> 00:46:17.936
Hawthorne again,
the communications of a

00:46:17.936 --> 00:46:21.632
solitary mind with itself.
The secret is to find

00:46:21.632 --> 00:46:25.983
sustenance in people like
Hawthorne, in the wisdom of the

00:46:25.983 --> 00:46:29.890
brilliant deceased.
Now, one question I,

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:34.647
myself, as a reader have
struggled with about this novel

00:46:34.647 --> 00:46:38.800
is whether Roth imagines that
Nathan's state,

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:44.604
when he describes it that way,
is a false one or a weak one,

00:46:44.604 --> 00:46:50.250
one to be rejected.
Is it a withdrawal from life?

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:55.398
I think that last sentence,
"The secret is to find

00:46:55.398 --> 00:47:02.018
sustenance in people like
Hawthorne," gives us the answer

00:47:02.018 --> 00:47:05.844
that I'm content with.
And that is:

00:47:05.844 --> 00:47:10.861
yes, it's a withdrawal from
life if you don't understand

00:47:10.861 --> 00:47:15.423
Hawthorne as a person,
as someone with whom you can

00:47:15.423 --> 00:47:20.007
become entangled.
It's the very act of thinking

00:47:20.007 --> 00:47:25.074
of a literary forebear as a
person rather than a text that

00:47:25.074 --> 00:47:28.630
allows this to be a productive
state,

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:33.345
one that Nathan will be drawn
out of by Coleman,

00:47:33.345 --> 00:47:37.860
but yet one that the novel does
not reject.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:44.293
It's when Coleman becomes for
Nathan a character,

00:47:44.293 --> 00:47:50.324
the person becomes this living
representation,

00:47:50.324 --> 00:47:55.820
that he is drawn out of his
solitude.

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:58.613
So, in a way,
it's not even Coleman the

00:47:58.613 --> 00:48:02.069
person that draws him out,
but his world when he

00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:04.789
encounters Coleman and his
story,

00:48:04.789 --> 00:48:08.798
when he sees Coleman's body
during that dance as a cipher,

00:48:08.798 --> 00:48:12.526
as the sign of all that you
can't know about the other

00:48:12.526 --> 00:48:15.399
fellow.
When he sees that about

00:48:15.399 --> 00:48:20.786
Coleman, that's when he comes
out of one productive state of

00:48:20.786 --> 00:48:26.081
communing with the brilliant
dead and comes in to the world

00:48:26.081 --> 00:48:30.190
of Coleman who will be
dead very,

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:31.310
very shortly.

00:48:35.989 --> 00:48:41.962
So, on Monday next I will talk
about that relationship between

00:48:41.962 --> 00:48:47.346
desire and the literary,
between persons and characters,

00:48:47.346 --> 00:48:51.473
between life and novel.
Think about those things as you

00:48:51.473 --> 00:48:52.473
read.

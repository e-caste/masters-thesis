00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.528
Professor Robert Shiller:
Today's lecture is about

00:00:05.528 --> 00:00:09.287
portfolio diversification and
about supporting financial

00:00:09.287 --> 00:00:13.920
institutions,
notably mutual funds.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.410
It's actually kind of a crusade
of mine--I believe that the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.670
world needs more portfolio
diversification.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.086
That might sound to you a
little bit odd,

00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:32.124
but I think it's absolutely
true that the same kind of cause

00:00:32.124 --> 00:00:35.370
that Emmett Thompson goes
through,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.493
which is to help the poor
people of the world,

00:00:38.493 --> 00:00:42.034
can be advanced through
portfolio diversification--I

00:00:42.034 --> 00:00:45.540
seriously mean that.
There are a lot of human

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.910
hardships that can be solved by
diversifying portfolios.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.851
What I'm going to talk about
today applies not just to

00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:58.090
comfortable wealthy people,
but it applies to everyone.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.594
It's really about risk.
When there's a bad outcome for

00:01:07.594 --> 00:01:10.769
anyone, that's the outcome of
some random draw.

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:14.595
When people get into real
trouble in their lives,

00:01:14.595 --> 00:01:19.298
it's because of a sequence of
bad events that push them into

00:01:19.298 --> 00:01:23.767
unfortunate positions and,
very often, financial risk

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:28.081
management is part of the thing
that prevents that from

00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:32.988
happening.
The first--let me go--I want to

00:01:32.988 --> 00:01:38.230
start this lecture with some
mathematics.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.632
It's a continuation of the
second lecture,

00:01:42.632 --> 00:01:48.860
where I talked about the
principle of dispersal of risk.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.543
I want now to carry that
forward into something a little

00:01:53.543 --> 00:01:57.290
bit more focused on the
portfolio problem.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.707
I'm going to start this lecture
with a discussion of how one

00:02:01.707 --> 00:02:06.200
constructs a portfolio and what
are the mathematics of it.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.720
That will lead us into the
capital asset pricing model,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.659
which is the cornerstone of a
lot of thinking in finance.

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:20.797
I'm going to go through this
rather quickly because there are

00:02:20.797 --> 00:02:26.020
other courses at Yale that will
cover this more thoroughly,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.949
notably, John Geanakoplos's
Econ 251.

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:33.570
I think we can get the basic
points here.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.611
Let's start with the basic idea.
I want to just say it in the

00:02:42.611 --> 00:02:46.929
simplest possible terms.
What is it that--First of all,

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:49.819
a portfolio,
let's define that.

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.241
A portfolio is the collection
of assets that you

00:02:53.241 --> 00:02:56.809
have--financial assets,
tangible assets--it's your

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.888
wealth.
The first and fundamental

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:03.715
principle is:
you care only about the total

00:03:03.715 --> 00:03:06.926
portfolio.
You don't want to be someone

00:03:06.926 --> 00:03:10.907
like the fisherman who boasts
about one big fish that he

00:03:10.907 --> 00:03:15.250
caught because it's not--we're
talking about livelihoods.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.681
It's all the fish that you
caught, so there's nothing to be

00:03:18.681 --> 00:03:20.930
proud of if you had one big
success.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.630
That's the first very basic
principle.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.030
Do you agree with me on that?
So, when we say portfolio

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.253
management, we mean managing
everything that gives you

00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:34.888
economic benefit.
Now, underlying our theory is

00:03:34.888 --> 00:03:39.641
the idea that we measure the
outcome of your investment in

00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:44.644
your portfolio by the mean of
the return on the portfolio and

00:03:44.644 --> 00:03:48.729
the variance of the return on
the portfolio.

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.990
The return, of course,
in any given time period is the

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.389
percentage increase in the
portfolio;

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.379
or, it could be a negative
number, it could be a decrease.

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.641
The principle is that you want
the expected value of the return

00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:08.732
to be as high as possible given
its variance and you want the

00:04:08.732 --> 00:04:13.314
variance of the return on the
portfolio to be as low as

00:04:13.314 --> 00:04:19.997
possible given the return,
because high expected return is

00:04:19.997 --> 00:04:22.658
a good thing.
You could say,

00:04:22.658 --> 00:04:26.069
I think my portfolio has an
expected return of 12%--that

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.790
would be better than if it had
an expected return of 10%.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.689
But, on the other hand,
you don't want high variance

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.990
because that's risk;
so, both of those matter.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.231
In fact, different people might
make different choices about how

00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:45.069
much risk they're willing to
bear to get a higher expected

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:47.179
return.
But ultimately,

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:51.013
everyone agrees I--that's the
premise here,

00:04:51.013 --> 00:04:55.760
that for the--if you're
comparing two portfolios with

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.226
the same variance,
then you want the one with the

00:04:59.226 --> 00:05:01.646
higher expected return.
If you're comparing two

00:05:01.646 --> 00:05:03.953
portfolios with the same
expected return,

00:05:03.953 --> 00:05:06.779
then you want the one with the
lower variance.

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:11.410
All right is that clear
and--okay.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.300
So let's talk about--why don't
I just give it in a very

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.789
intuitive term.
Suppose we had a lot of

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.430
different stocks that we could
put into a portfolio,

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.032
and suppose they're all
independent of each other--that

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:27.959
means there's no correlation.
We talked about that in Lecture

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:31.309
2.
There's no correlation between

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:37.226
them and that means that the
variance--and I want to talk

00:05:37.226 --> 00:05:41.029
about equally-weighted
portfolio.

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:47.830
So, we're going to have
n independent assets;

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.982
they could be stocks.
Each one has a standard

00:05:57.982 --> 00:06:03.040
deviation of return,
call that σ.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.862
Let's suppose that all of them
are the same--they all have the

00:06:12.862 --> 00:06:17.978
same standard deviation.
We're going to call r

00:06:17.978 --> 00:06:22.880
the expected return of these
assets.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.979
Then, we have something called
the square root rule,

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:39.311
which says that the standard
deviation of the portfolio

00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:45.759
equals the standard deviation of
one of the assets,

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:48.870
divided by the square root of
n.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.420
Can you read this in the back?
Am I making that big enough?

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.175
Just barely, okay.
This is a special case,

00:06:56.175 --> 00:07:01.193
though, because I've assumed
that the assets are independent

00:07:01.193 --> 00:07:05.189
of each other,
which isn't usually the case.

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:08.858
It's like an insurance where
people imagine they're insuring

00:07:08.858 --> 00:07:12.215
people's lives and they think
that their deaths are all

00:07:12.215 --> 00:07:15.179
independent.
I'm transferring this to the

00:07:15.179 --> 00:07:19.750
portfolio management problem and
you can see it's the same idea.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:31.055
I've made a very special case
that this is the case of an

00:07:31.055 --> 00:07:38.830
equally-weighted portfolio.
It's a very important point,

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.810
if you see the very simple math
that I'm showing up here.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:50.863
The return on the portfolio is
r, but the standard

00:07:50.863 --> 00:07:59.060
deviation of the portfolio is
σ/√(n).

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.552
So, the optimal thing to do if
you live in a world like this is

00:08:02.552 --> 00:08:05.650
to get n as large
possible and you can reduce the

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.804
standard deviation of the
portfolio very much and there's

00:08:08.804 --> 00:08:11.170
no cost in terms of expected
return.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:15.574
In this simple world,
you'd want to make n 100

00:08:15.574 --> 00:08:20.650
or 1,000 or whatever you could.
Suppose you could find 10,000

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:24.031
independent assets,
then you could drive the

00:08:24.031 --> 00:08:28.120
uncertainty about the portfolio
practically to 0.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.392
Because the square root of
10,000 is 100,

00:08:30.392 --> 00:08:33.460
whatever the standard deviation
of the portfolio is,

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.590
you would divide it by 100 and
it would become really small.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:42.405
If you can find assets that all
have--that are all independent

00:08:42.405 --> 00:08:45.878
of each other,
you can reduce the variance of

00:08:45.878 --> 00:08:51.386
the portfolio very far.
That's the basic principle of

00:08:51.386 --> 00:08:56.860
portfolio diversification.
That's what portfolio managers

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.890
are supposed to be doing all the
time.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.927
Now, I want to be more general
than this and talk about the

00:09:07.927 --> 00:09:11.578
real case.
In the real world we don't have

00:09:11.578 --> 00:09:15.320
the problem that assets are
independent.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.909
The different stocks tend to
move up and down together.

00:09:18.909 --> 00:09:21.838
We don't have the ideal world
that I just described,

00:09:21.838 --> 00:09:24.709
but to some extent we do,
so we want to think about

00:09:24.709 --> 00:09:26.490
diversifying in this world.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:39.009
Now, I want to talk about
forming a portfolio where the

00:09:39.009 --> 00:09:45.051
assets are not independent of
each other, but are correlated

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:49.761
with each other.
What I'm going to do now--let's

00:09:49.761 --> 00:09:54.310
start out with the case
where--now it's going to get a

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:58.946
little bit more complicated if
we drop the independence

00:09:58.946 --> 00:10:02.026
assumption.
I'm going to drop more than the

00:10:02.026 --> 00:10:04.889
independence assumption,
I'm going to assume that the

00:10:04.889 --> 00:10:07.972
assets don't have the same
expected return and they don't

00:10:07.972 --> 00:10:12.176
have the same expected variance.
I'm going to--let's do the

00:10:12.176 --> 00:10:13.510
two-asset case.

00:10:21.149 --> 00:10:33.769
There's n = 2,
but not independent or not

00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:45.813
necessarily independent.
Asset 1 has expected return

00:10:45.813 --> 00:10:52.012
r_1.
This is different--I was

00:10:52.012 --> 00:10:56.676
assuming a minute ago that
they're all the same--it has

00:10:56.676 --> 00:11:00.908
standard--this is the
expectation of the return of

00:11:00.908 --> 00:11:05.830
Asset 1 and r_2
is the expectation of the

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:13.922
return--I'm sorry,
σ_1 is the

00:11:13.922 --> 00:11:24.600
standard deviation of the return
on Asset 1.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.970
We have the same for Asset 2;

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.260
it has an expected return of
r_2,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:39.390
it has a standard deviation of
return of σ_2.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:43.129
Those are the inputs into our
analysis.

00:11:43.129 --> 00:11:50.144
One more thing,
I said they're not independent,

00:11:50.144 --> 00:11:59.600
so we have to talk about the
covariance between the returns.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.059
So, we're going to have the
covariance between

00:12:03.059 --> 00:12:06.750
r_1 and
r_2,

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:11.093
which you can also call
σ_12 and those

00:12:11.093 --> 00:12:15.822
are the inputs to our analysis.
What we want to do now is

00:12:15.822 --> 00:12:20.714
compute the mean and variance of
the portfolio--or the mean and

00:12:20.714 --> 00:12:24.868
standard deviation,
since standard deviation is the

00:12:24.868 --> 00:12:29.627
square root of the variance--for
different combinations of the

00:12:29.627 --> 00:12:32.962
portfolios.
I'm going to generalize from

00:12:32.962 --> 00:12:37.607
our simple story even more by
saying that, let's not assume

00:12:37.607 --> 00:12:41.328
that we have equally-weighted.
We're going to put

00:12:41.328 --> 00:12:44.444
x_1
dollars--let's say we have $1 to

00:12:44.444 --> 00:12:47.919
invest, we can scale it up and
down, it doesn't matter.

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:53.113
Let's say it's $1 and we're
going to put

00:12:53.113 --> 00:13:00.170
x_1 in asset 1
and that leaves behind

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:05.230
1-x_1 in asset
2,

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:09.549
because we have $1 total.
We're not going to restrict

00:13:09.549 --> 00:13:12.110
x_1 to be a
positive number because,

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.966
as you know or you should know,
you can hold negative

00:13:14.966 --> 00:13:17.730
quantities of assets,
that's called shorting them.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.625
You can call your broker and
say, I'd like to short stock

00:13:21.625 --> 00:13:25.868
number one and what the broker
will do is borrow the shares on

00:13:25.868 --> 00:13:30.250
your behalf and sell them and
then you own negative shares.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:35.474
So, we're not going
to--x_1 can be

00:13:35.474 --> 00:13:40.908
anything and x--this is
x_2 =

00:13:40.908 --> 00:13:45.029
1-x_1,
so x_1 +

00:13:45.029 --> 00:13:46.380
x_2 = 1.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:14:00.060
Now, we just want to compute
what is the mean and variance of

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:06.315
the portfolio and that's simple
arithmetic, based on what we

00:14:06.315 --> 00:14:09.770
talked about before.
I'm going to erase this.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.103
The portfolio mean variance
will depend on

00:14:20.103 --> 00:14:25.116
x_1 in the way
that if you put--if you made

00:14:25.116 --> 00:14:29.943
x_1 = 1,
it would be asset 1 and if you

00:14:29.943 --> 00:14:34.513
made x_1 = 0,
then it would be the same as

00:14:34.513 --> 00:14:36.953
asset 2 returns.
But, in between,

00:14:36.953 --> 00:14:39.489
if some other number,
it'll be some blend of

00:14:39.489 --> 00:14:43.086
the--mean and variance of--the
portfolio will be some blend of

00:14:43.086 --> 00:14:45.740
the mean and variance of the two
assets.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:15:00.235
The portfolio expected return
is going to be given by the

00:15:00.235 --> 00:15:10.031
summation i = 1 to
n, of x_i*r

00:15:10.031 --> 00:15:14.744
_i,.
In this case,

00:15:14.744 --> 00:15:17.737
since n = 2 that's
x_1

00:15:17.737 --> 00:15:20.530
r_1 +
x_2

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:24.777
r_2,
or that's x_1

00:15:24.777 --> 00:15:28.805
r_1 + (1 -
x_1)

00:15:28.805 --> 00:15:30.820
r_2;

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:41.029
that's the expected return on
the portfolio.

00:15:41.029 --> 00:15:48.532
The variance of the portfolio
σ²--this is the

00:15:48.532 --> 00:15:53.534
portfolio variance--is
σ² =

00:15:53.534 --> 00:16:00.482
x_1²
σ_1²

00:16:00.482 --> 00:16:07.707
+ x_2²
σ_2²

00:16:07.707 --> 00:16:13.681
+ 2x_1
x_2

00:16:13.681 --> 00:16:21.333
σ_12;
that's just the formula for the

00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:26.840
variance of the portfolio as a
function of--Now,

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.307
since they have to sum to 1,
I can write this as

00:16:31.307 --> 00:16:36.059
x_1²
σ_1²

00:16:36.059 --> 00:16:39.196
+ (1 -
x_1)²

00:16:39.196 --> 00:16:44.138
σ_2²
+ 2x_1 (1 -

00:16:44.138 --> 00:16:49.081
x_1)
σ_12 and so that

00:16:49.081 --> 00:16:53.358
together traces out--I can
choose any value of

00:16:53.358 --> 00:16:58.840
x_1 I want,
it can be number from minus

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.880
infinity to plus infinity.
That shows me then for any

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:08.329
value of x_1,
I can compute what r is

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:12.960
and what σ²
is and I can then describe the

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:18.589
opportunities I have from
investing that depend on these.

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:26.836
Now, one thing to do is to
solve the equation for r

00:17:26.836 --> 00:17:35.662
and x_1 and I
can then recast the variance in

00:17:35.662 --> 00:17:40.913
terms of r ;
that gives us the variance of

00:17:40.913 --> 00:17:44.627
the portfolio as a function of
the expected return of the

00:17:44.627 --> 00:17:48.328
portfolio.
Let me just solve this

00:17:48.328 --> 00:17:53.489
for--let's solve
x_1 for

00:17:53.489 --> 00:18:00.714
r. I've got--this should
be x--did I make a

00:18:00.714 --> 00:18:07.423
mistake there--so it says that
r_1 -

00:18:07.423 --> 00:18:12.842
r_2 =
x_1

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:19.680
r_1 -
r_2,

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.901
so x_1 =
(r -

00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:26.928
r_2)/(
r_1 -

00:18:26.928 --> 00:18:31.940
r_2) and I can
substitute this into this

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:37.399
equation and I get the portfolio
variance as a function of the

00:18:37.399 --> 00:18:45.171
portfolio expected return r.
 That's all the basic math

00:18:45.171 --> 00:18:48.575
that we need.
If I do that,

00:18:48.575 --> 00:18:54.740
then I get what's called the
frontier for the portfolio.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:59.200
I have an example on the screen
here, but it shows other things.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:05.461
Let me just--rather than--maybe
I'm showing too many things at

00:19:05.461 --> 00:19:07.079
once.
Let me just draw it.

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:09.740
I'll leave that up for now but
we're moving to that.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:18.256
What we're doing here is
the--with two assets,

00:19:18.256 --> 00:19:29.800
if I plot the expected annual
return r on this axis and

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:40.019
I plot the variance of the
portfolio on this axis,

00:19:40.019 --> 00:19:47.123
what we have--I'm sorry,
the standard deviation of the

00:19:47.123 --> 00:19:49.670
portfolio return.

00:19:56.369 --> 00:20:00.732
It tends to look--it looks
something like this--it's a

00:20:00.732 --> 00:20:05.637
hyperbola;
there's a minimum variance

00:20:05.637 --> 00:20:13.773
portfolio where this σ
is as small as possible and

00:20:13.773 --> 00:20:22.662
there are many other possible
portfolios that lie along this

00:20:22.662 --> 00:20:27.078
curve.
The curve includes points on

00:20:27.078 --> 00:20:31.609
it, which would represent the
initial assets.

00:20:31.609 --> 00:20:36.568
For example,
we might have--this is asset

00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:44.130
1--and we might have something
here--this could be asset 2.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:51.585
Depending on where the assets
expected returns are and the

00:20:51.585 --> 00:20:57.711
assets' standard deviations,
we can see that we might be

00:20:57.711 --> 00:21:02.276
able to do better than--have a
lower variance than either

00:21:02.276 --> 00:21:05.147
asset.
The equally-weighted case that

00:21:05.147 --> 00:21:09.207
I gave a minute ago was one
where the two assets had--were

00:21:09.207 --> 00:21:12.982
at the same--had the same
expected return and the same

00:21:12.982 --> 00:21:16.575
variance;
but this is quite a bit more

00:21:16.575 --> 00:21:19.325
general.
So that's the expected return

00:21:19.325 --> 00:21:22.099
and efficient portfolio frontier
problem.

00:21:22.099 --> 00:21:26.757
I wanted to show an example
with real data that I computed

00:21:26.757 --> 00:21:29.779
and that's what's up on the
screen.

00:21:29.779 --> 00:21:36.667
The pink line takes two assets,
one is stocks and the other is

00:21:36.667 --> 00:21:40.619
bonds, actually government
bonds.

00:21:40.619 --> 00:21:45.212
I computed the efficient
portfolio frontier for

00:21:45.212 --> 00:21:50.704
various--it's the efficient
portfolio frontier using the

00:21:50.704 --> 00:21:57.402
formula I just gave you.
The pink line here is the

00:21:57.402 --> 00:22:06.144
efficient portfolio frontier
when we have only stocks and

00:22:06.144 --> 00:22:10.952
bonds to invest.
You can see the different

00:22:10.952 --> 00:22:14.931
points--I've calculated this
using data from 1983 until

00:22:14.931 --> 00:22:19.427
2006--and I computed all of the
inputs to those equations that

00:22:19.427 --> 00:22:22.894
we just saw.
I computed the average return

00:22:22.894 --> 00:22:27.248
on stocks over that time period
and I computed the average

00:22:27.248 --> 00:22:30.380
return on bonds over that time
period.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:34.135
These are long-term government
bonds and I--now these

00:22:34.135 --> 00:22:38.396
are--since they're long-term,
they have some uncertainty and

00:22:38.396 --> 00:22:40.798
variability to them.
I computed the

00:22:40.798 --> 00:22:42.613
σ_1,
σ_2,

00:22:42.613 --> 00:22:44.834
r_1,
and r_2 for

00:22:44.834 --> 00:22:47.290
those and I plugged it into that
formula, which we just showed.

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:52.077
That's the curve that I got out.
It shows the standard deviation

00:22:52.077 --> 00:22:56.716
of the return on the portfolio
as a function of the expected

00:22:56.716 --> 00:23:00.336
return on the portfolio.
I can achieve any

00:23:00.336 --> 00:23:05.440
combination--I can achieve any
point on that by choosing an

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:10.683
allocation of my portfolio.
This point right here is,

00:23:10.683 --> 00:23:15.369
on the pink line,
is a portfolio 100% bonds.

00:23:15.369 --> 00:23:19.565
Over this time period,
that portfolio had an expected

00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:23.840
return of something like a
little over 9% and it had a

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.309
standard deviation of a little
over 9%.

00:23:27.309 --> 00:23:32.467
This is a portfolio,
which is 100% stocks,

00:23:32.467 --> 00:23:39.133
and that portfolio had a much
higher average return or

00:23:39.133 --> 00:23:46.555
expected return--13%--but it
also had a much higher standard

00:23:46.555 --> 00:23:52.089
deviation of return--it was
about 16%.

00:23:52.089 --> 00:23:56.109
So, you can see that those are
the two raw portfolios.

00:23:56.109 --> 00:23:59.844
That could be investor only in
bonds or an investor only in

00:23:59.844 --> 00:24:03.901
stocks, but I also show on here
what some other returns are that

00:24:03.901 --> 00:24:07.766
are available.
The minimum variance portfolio

00:24:07.766 --> 00:24:11.469
is down here.
That's got the lowest possible

00:24:11.469 --> 00:24:16.511
standard deviation of expected
return and that's 25% stocks and

00:24:16.511 --> 00:24:19.520
75% bonds with this sample
period.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.893
I can try other portfolios;
this one right here--I'm

00:24:24.893 --> 00:24:28.653
pointing to a point on the pink
line--that point right there,

00:24:28.653 --> 00:24:33.061
50% stocks, 50% bonds.
You can see–You can also

00:24:33.061 --> 00:24:38.648
go up here, you can go beyond
100% stocks, you can have 150%

00:24:38.648 --> 00:24:42.568
stocks in your portfolio.
That means you'd have a

00:24:42.568 --> 00:24:45.049
leveraged portfolio,
you would be borrowing.

00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:50.644
If you had $1 to invest you can
borrow $.50 and invest in a

00:24:50.644 --> 00:24:55.359
$1.50 worth of stocks.
That would put you out here;

00:24:55.359 --> 00:24:59.982
you would have very much more
return, but you'd have more

00:24:59.982 --> 00:25:02.351
risk.
Borrowing to buy stocks is

00:25:02.351 --> 00:25:05.817
going to be risky.
You could also pick a point

00:25:05.817 --> 00:25:10.370
down here, which is more than
100% bonds--how would you do

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:13.208
that?
Well, you could short in the

00:25:13.208 --> 00:25:16.506
stock market,
you could short $.50 worth of

00:25:16.506 --> 00:25:20.982
stocks and buy $1.50 worth of
bonds and that would put you

00:25:20.982 --> 00:25:23.918
down here.
Any one of those things is

00:25:23.918 --> 00:25:27.910
possible it's just the simple
math that I just showed you.

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:30.506
Do you have any idea what you
would like to do,

00:25:30.506 --> 00:25:33.569
assuming this?
Well if you're an investor,

00:25:33.569 --> 00:25:37.891
you don't like variance.
So, you probably don't want to

00:25:37.891 --> 00:25:41.837
pick any point down here,
because you're not getting

00:25:41.837 --> 00:25:46.635
anything by picking a point down
there because you could have a

00:25:46.635 --> 00:25:50.039
better point by just moving it
up here.

00:25:50.039 --> 00:25:53.380
You'd have a higher expected
return with no more variance.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.109
It's getting kind of
complicated, isn't it?

00:25:55.109 --> 00:25:58.461
We started out with just a
simple idea: that you don't want

00:25:58.461 --> 00:26:01.755
to put all your eggs in one
basket and if you had a lot of

00:26:01.755 --> 00:26:04.760
independent stocks you would
want to just weight them

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.450
equally.
But now, you see there are a

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:11.479
lot of possibilities and the
outcome of your portfolio choice

00:26:11.479 --> 00:26:15.880
can be anything along this line.
I'm not going to tell you what

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.777
you want to do except to say,
you would never pick a point

00:26:19.777 --> 00:26:22.990
below the minimum variance
portfolio, right?

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:27.468
Because, if you did,
then you would always be

00:26:27.468 --> 00:26:29.899
dominated.
You could always find a

00:26:29.899 --> 00:26:32.792
portfolio that had a higher
expected return for the same

00:26:32.792 --> 00:26:35.308
standard deviation.
But beyond that,

00:26:35.308 --> 00:26:39.128
if you were confined to just
stocks and bonds,

00:26:39.128 --> 00:26:44.051
it would be a matter of taste
where along this frontier you

00:26:44.051 --> 00:26:46.463
would be.
You would call it an efficient

00:26:46.463 --> 00:26:49.773
portfolio frontier.
It would be anywhere from here

00:26:49.773 --> 00:26:54.677
to here, depending on how much
you're afraid of risk and how

00:26:54.677 --> 00:27:00.384
much you want expected return.
Now, we can also move to three

00:27:00.384 --> 00:27:04.930
assets and, in fact,
to any number of assets.

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:08.369
The same formula extends to
more assets.

00:27:08.369 --> 00:27:14.018
In fact, I have it--suppose we
have three assets and we want to

00:27:14.018 --> 00:27:19.666
compute the efficient portfolio
frontier, the mean and variance

00:27:19.666 --> 00:27:24.045
of the portfolio.
What I have up there on the

00:27:24.045 --> 00:27:29.340
diagram are calculations I made
for the efficient portfolio

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:34.983
frontier with three assets.
So, now we have n = 3

00:27:34.983 --> 00:27:39.650
and in the chart are stocks,
bonds, and oil.

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:45.851
Oil is a very important asset,
so we want to compute what

00:27:45.851 --> 00:27:50.059
that--so now we have lots of
inputs.

00:27:50.059 --> 00:27:52.237
Let's put the
inputs--r_1,

00:27:52.237 --> 00:27:54.777
r_2,
and r_3 are

00:27:54.777 --> 00:27:57.109
the expected returns on the
three assets.

00:27:57.109 --> 00:28:01.625
Then, we have the standard
deviations of the returns of the

00:28:01.625 --> 00:28:06.141
three assets and we have the
covariance between the returns

00:28:06.141 --> 00:28:10.175
on the three assets.
There are three of them--

00:28:10.175 --> 00:28:13.640
σ_12,
σ_13,

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:19.176
and σ_23.
That's what we have to know to

00:28:19.176 --> 00:28:25.569
compute the efficient portfolio
frontier with three assets.

00:28:25.569 --> 00:28:27.950
To make this picture,
I did that.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:32.546
I computed the returns on the
stocks, bonds,

00:28:32.546 --> 00:28:38.747
and oil for every year from
1983 and I computed the average

00:28:38.747 --> 00:28:41.765
returns,
which I take as the expected

00:28:41.765 --> 00:28:45.112
returns, I took the standard
deviations, and I took the

00:28:45.112 --> 00:28:47.124
covariance.
These are all formulas,

00:28:47.124 --> 00:28:49.912
I just plugged it into formulas
that we did in the second

00:28:49.912 --> 00:28:54.391
lecture.
What is the portfolio expected

00:28:54.391 --> 00:28:56.806
return?
The portfolio expected

00:28:56.806 --> 00:28:59.416
return--we have to choose three
things now:

00:28:59.416 --> 00:29:02.026
x_1,
x_2,

00:29:02.026 --> 00:29:05.357
and x_3.
x_1 is the

00:29:05.357 --> 00:29:08.726
amount that I put into the first
asset, x_2 is

00:29:08.726 --> 00:29:11.279
the amount that I put into the
second asset,

00:29:11.279 --> 00:29:14.549
and x3 is the amount I
put into the third asset.

00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:16.829
I'm going to constrain them to
sum to one.

00:29:16.829 --> 00:29:21.783
The return on the portfolio is
x_1

00:29:21.783 --> 00:29:25.944
r_1 +
x_2

00:29:25.944 --> 00:29:30.105
r_2 +
x_3

00:29:30.105 --> 00:29:36.558
r_3.
The variance of the portfolio,

00:29:36.558 --> 00:29:41.847
σ²,
is x_1²

00:29:41.847 --> 00:29:48.144
σ_1^(2) +
x_2²

00:29:48.144 --> 00:29:54.693
σ_2²
+ x_3²

00:29:54.693 --> 00:30:01.619
σ_3²
-- then we have to the count of

00:30:01.619 --> 00:30:07.916
all of the covariance terms -- +
2x_1x

00:30:07.916 --> 00:30:12.954
_2
σ_12 +

00:30:12.954 --> 00:30:19.880
2x_1x_3
σ_13 +

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:29.200
2x_2x_3
σ_23.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.755
Is that clear enough?
It seems like a logical

00:30:32.755 --> 00:30:37.283
extension of that formula to
three assets and you can easily

00:30:37.283 --> 00:30:40.890
see how to extend it to four or
more assets,

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:43.230
it's just the logical extension
of that.

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:49.100
What I did in this diagram is I
computed the efficient portfolio

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:54.039
frontier--now it's the blue line
with three assets.

00:30:54.039 --> 00:31:00.399
Now, once you have more than
three--more than two assets--it

00:31:00.399 --> 00:31:06.220
might be possible to get points
inside the frontier.

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.870
But I'm talking here--this is
the actually the frontier--the

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:13.150
best possible portfolio
consisting of three assets.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:17.160
You can see that it dominates
the pink line.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.003
When you add another asset,
you do better when you have

00:31:21.003 --> 00:31:24.064
three assets,
you do better than if you just

00:31:24.064 --> 00:31:28.121
had two because there's more
diversification possible with

00:31:28.121 --> 00:31:32.582
three assets than with two.
Oil, bonds, and stocks are all

00:31:32.582 --> 00:31:35.750
independent--somewhat
independent--they're not

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.501
perfectly independent,
but they're somewhat

00:31:38.501 --> 00:31:40.681
independent and,
to the extent that they are,

00:31:40.681 --> 00:31:43.993
it lowers the variance.
You should see that the blue

00:31:43.993 --> 00:31:46.956
line is better than the pink
line because,

00:31:46.956 --> 00:31:50.931
for any expected return,
the blue line is to the left of

00:31:50.931 --> 00:31:52.809
the pink line,
right?

00:31:52.809 --> 00:31:56.238
So, for example,
at an annual expected return of

00:31:56.238 --> 00:31:59.009
12% if I have a portfolio of
stocks,

00:31:59.009 --> 00:32:03.405
bonds, and oil I can get a
standard deviation of something

00:32:03.405 --> 00:32:07.344
like 8% on my portfolio.
But if I would confine myself

00:32:07.344 --> 00:32:11.012
just to stocks and bonds,
then I would get a much higher

00:32:11.012 --> 00:32:13.859
standard deviation.
Are you following this?

00:32:13.859 --> 00:32:17.589
The general principle of
portfolio management is:

00:32:17.589 --> 00:32:21.319
you want to include as many
assets as you can.

00:32:21.319 --> 00:32:24.099
You want to get it--if you keep
adding assets,

00:32:24.099 --> 00:32:27.435
you can do better and better on
your portfolio standard

00:32:27.435 --> 00:32:31.304
deviation.
You can see some of the points

00:32:31.304 --> 00:32:34.910
I've made along the blue line
here.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:41.728
This is--let's see if I have it.
This is a portfolio,

00:32:41.728 --> 00:32:48.349
which has all oil and stocks
and it has no bonds.

00:32:48.349 --> 00:32:53.636
This portfolio,
the minimum variance portfolio,

00:32:53.636 --> 00:32:59.037
is 9% oil, 27% stocks,
and 64% bonds and most of

00:32:59.037 --> 00:33:05.082
the--many choices you can make.
The first--you see,

00:33:05.082 --> 00:33:11.256
the idea here is that in order
to manage portfolios what we

00:33:11.256 --> 00:33:15.940
want to do is calculate these
statistics,

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:19.814
which are the expected returns
on the various assets,

00:33:19.814 --> 00:33:23.390
the standard deviations of the
various assets,

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:27.805
and you've got to know their
covariances because that affects

00:33:27.805 --> 00:33:32.181
the variance of the portfolio.
The more they covary--they move

00:33:32.181 --> 00:33:34.529
together--the less they cancel
out.

00:33:34.529 --> 00:33:38.258
So, the higher the covariance
is, generally,

00:33:38.258 --> 00:33:42.421
the higher--you can see from
here--the higher the

00:33:42.421 --> 00:33:45.370
σ² of the portfolio.

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:57.202
Is that clear?
There's one more thing that we

00:33:57.202 --> 00:33:59.609
can do.
I have three assets shown here.

00:33:59.609 --> 00:34:03.341
I have stocks,
bonds, and oil but I want also

00:34:03.341 --> 00:34:07.921
to add one more final asset,
we'll call it the riskless

00:34:07.921 --> 00:34:09.839
asset,
which is the

00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:15.365
asset–long-term bonds are
somewhat uncertain and variable

00:34:15.365 --> 00:34:19.637
because they're long-term.
If we have an annual return

00:34:19.637 --> 00:34:22.511
that we're looking at,
we can find a completely

00:34:22.511 --> 00:34:26.323
riskless asset with an annual
return--it would be a government

00:34:26.323 --> 00:34:30.835
bond that matures in one year.
Now, assuming that we trust the

00:34:30.835 --> 00:34:34.517
government--I think the U.S.
Government has never defaulted

00:34:34.517 --> 00:34:37.030
on its debt--we'd take that as a
riskless return.

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:40.438
It probably has some risk,
but the way we approximate

00:34:40.438 --> 00:34:43.257
things in finance,
we take the government as

00:34:43.257 --> 00:34:46.480
riskless.
With the government expected

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:51.136
return, we want to make that
expected return as a fourth

00:34:51.136 --> 00:34:55.539
asset--we could call it
r_4 but I'll

00:34:55.539 --> 00:34:58.502
call it
r_f--it's a

00:34:58.502 --> 00:35:02.027
special asset.
So r_f is the

00:35:02.027 --> 00:35:02.960
riskless asset.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:17.719
So, for it, σ_f
= 0.

00:35:17.719 --> 00:35:22.213
It's like a fourth asset but
we're using a special feature of

00:35:22.213 --> 00:35:28.562
this asset: that it has no risk.
Moreover, the correlation--the

00:35:28.562 --> 00:35:35.532
covariance between any of these
σ_1f = 0,

00:35:35.532 --> 00:35:37.860
etc.
It just doesn't have any risk

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:41.999
to it, it has no variability.
If we want to add that asset to

00:35:41.999 --> 00:35:45.761
the portfolio,
what it does is it produces an

00:35:45.761 --> 00:35:50.890
efficient portfolio frontier
that is now a straight line;

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:55.780
I show that on the diagram.
The best possible portfolio

00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:01.309
that you can get would be points
along this straight line.

00:36:01.309 --> 00:36:08.586
That is the final aspect of the
efficient portfolio

00:36:08.586 --> 00:36:12.921
calculations.
Again, I'm not able to give

00:36:12.921 --> 00:36:17.622
this as much of a discussion as
I would like because I don't

00:36:17.622 --> 00:36:20.730
want to spend too much time on
this.

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:24.516
In the review sections I'm
hopeful that your T.A.'s can

00:36:24.516 --> 00:36:28.081
elaborate on this more.
There's a very important

00:36:28.081 --> 00:36:32.913
principle that finally comes out
here, it is that you always want

00:36:32.913 --> 00:36:37.670
to reduce the variance of your
portfolio as much as you can.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:40.770
That means that you want to
pick, ultimately,

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:44.504
a point on this--this line is
tangent to the efficient

00:36:44.504 --> 00:36:48.380
portfolio frontier with all the
other assets in it.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:52.565
Tangent means that it has the
same slope, it just touches the

00:36:52.565 --> 00:36:56.820
efficient portfolio frontier for
risky assets at one point,

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.764
and the slope of the efficient
portfolio frontier,

00:37:00.764 --> 00:37:04.849
including the riskless asset,
is a straight line that goes

00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:06.780
through the tangency point,
here.

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:12.840
That is the--I think that's the
end of my mathematics.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:19.916
What I have shown here is how
you calculate your portfolio

00:37:19.916 --> 00:37:23.659
management.
The way you would go about it,

00:37:23.659 --> 00:37:27.704
if you're a portfolio manager,
is you have to come up with

00:37:27.704 --> 00:37:31.678
estimates of the inputs to these
formulas--that means the

00:37:31.678 --> 00:37:34.664
expected returns,
the standard deviations,

00:37:34.664 --> 00:37:38.461
and the covariances.
You take all the risky assets

00:37:38.461 --> 00:37:43.388
and you analyze them first to
get their--you have to do a

00:37:43.388 --> 00:37:48.139
statistical analysis to get
their expected returns,

00:37:48.139 --> 00:37:49.679
their variances,
and their covariances.

00:37:49.679 --> 00:37:54.067
Once you've got them together,
then you can compute the

00:37:54.067 --> 00:37:58.780
efficient portfolio frontier
without the riskless asset.

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:02.607
Then finally,
the final step is to find what

00:38:02.607 --> 00:38:07.860
is the tangency line that goes
through the riskless rate.

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:12.503
It doesn't show it on this
chart, it goes through 5% at a

00:38:12.503 --> 00:38:18.460
standard deviation of 0,
then it touches the risky asset

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:25.815
efficient portfolio frontier at
one point, then from there it

00:38:25.815 --> 00:38:33.293
goes up above in terms of higher
expected returns for the same

00:38:33.293 --> 00:38:38.479
variance.
That's the theory of efficient

00:38:38.479 --> 00:38:43.860
portfolio calculation.
There's something that--a

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:49.846
fundamental principle--and this
is leading us now to the

00:38:49.846 --> 00:38:56.268
institutional topic of this
course--is that there's only one

00:38:56.268 --> 00:39:02.689
tangency portfolio and that
portfolio is called the tangency

00:39:02.689 --> 00:39:06.848
portfolio,
where a line drawn from the

00:39:06.848 --> 00:39:11.893
risk--from the x-axis at the
riskless rate is tangent to the

00:39:11.893 --> 00:39:22.883
efficient portfolio frontier.
The tangency portfolio is the

00:39:22.883 --> 00:39:36.328
portfolio that one should hold.
The tangency portfolio gives

00:39:36.328 --> 00:39:45.004
rise to what's called the mutual
fund theorem in finance,

00:39:45.004 --> 00:39:54.610
which says that all investors
need is a single mutual fund.

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:56.869
Now, I haven't defined mutual
fund yet.

00:39:56.869 --> 00:40:03.238
A mutual fund is an investment
vehicle that allows investors to

00:40:03.238 --> 00:40:07.655
hold a portfolio.
The theory of mutual funds is:

00:40:07.655 --> 00:40:12.257
nobody is supposed to be
holding anything other than--the

00:40:12.257 --> 00:40:17.106
ideal theory of mutual funds is
holding something other than

00:40:17.106 --> 00:40:21.147
this tangency portfolio.
So, why don't we set up a

00:40:21.147 --> 00:40:25.324
company that creates a portfolio
like that and investors can buy

00:40:25.324 --> 00:40:29.358
into that portfolio.
What this--if my analysis is

00:40:29.358 --> 00:40:33.120
right--namely,
if I've got all of the right

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:37.329
estimates of the expected
returns on stocks,

00:40:37.329 --> 00:40:40.413
bonds, and oil,
and the standard deviations and

00:40:40.413 --> 00:40:43.900
covariances--and assuming the
interest rate is 5%,

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.702
which is what I've assumed
here, that this line,

00:40:46.702 --> 00:40:51.820
if you go to 0 it hits that 5%.
It hits the vertical access at

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:54.714
5%.
Then everyone should be holding

00:40:54.714 --> 00:40:58.054
the tangency portfolio.
What is the tangency portfolio

00:40:58.054 --> 00:41:01.320
in this case?
It's 12% oil,

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:08.738
36% stocks, and 52% bonds.
That's what I got using this

00:41:08.738 --> 00:41:11.247
sample period.
Some people might disagree with

00:41:11.247 --> 00:41:13.090
that, they might not take my
estimates.

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:17.074
They might say my sample period
was off, but that's what the

00:41:17.074 --> 00:41:20.384
theory--using my data for the
sample period that I

00:41:20.384 --> 00:41:24.572
computed--the expected returns
and co-variances says one should

00:41:24.572 --> 00:41:27.894
do.
The theory says everybody

00:41:27.894 --> 00:41:33.866
should be investing in these
proportions and this theory

00:41:33.866 --> 00:41:39.947
then--it doesn't leave any
latitude for individual choice

00:41:39.947 --> 00:41:46.679
except that you can choose which
mixture of the mutual fund and

00:41:46.679 --> 00:41:52.783
the riskless asset you want.
Somebody who is very risk

00:41:52.783 --> 00:41:56.469
averse could say,
I want to hold only the

00:41:56.469 --> 00:42:02.090
riskless assets because I just
don't like any risk at all.

00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:05.171
That person--I should have
maybe included that in the

00:42:05.171 --> 00:42:08.489
diagram--that person could get
5% return with no risk.

00:42:08.489 --> 00:42:11.548
Somebody else might say,
well I want to just hold this

00:42:11.548 --> 00:42:14.260
point, I want to hold the
tangency portfolio.

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:18.401
That's attractive to me because
I could then get a bigger

00:42:18.401 --> 00:42:21.728
expected return,
I could get almost 12% return

00:42:21.728 --> 00:42:24.412
per year,
and I'd sacrifice--I'd have

00:42:24.412 --> 00:42:26.710
some standard deviation of like
8%;

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:30.599
but, if that's what I want,
if I have different tastes

00:42:30.599 --> 00:42:34.708
about risk, then--and that's
what I want--then that's the

00:42:34.708 --> 00:42:38.060
optimal thing to do.
Other people might say,

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.895
well you know,
I'm really an adventurer--I

00:42:40.895 --> 00:42:44.560
don't care too much about
risk--I want the much higher

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.438
return.
Such a person might pick a

00:42:47.438 --> 00:42:52.165
point up here and that would be
a portfolio with--a leveraged

00:42:52.165 --> 00:42:55.128
portfolio.
That would be a portfolio where

00:42:55.128 --> 00:42:58.816
you borrowed at the riskless
rate and you put more than 100%

00:42:58.816 --> 00:43:01.630
of your money into the tangency
portfolio.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:07.280
What you could do is,
say, borrow $.50 on your $1 and

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:13.039
put $1.50 into a portfolio,
which consisted of 9% oil,

00:43:13.039 --> 00:43:17.932
27% stocks, and 64% bonds.
Everyone would do that,

00:43:17.932 --> 00:43:22.048
no one would ever hold some
other portfolio because you can

00:43:22.048 --> 00:43:25.881
see that this line is the
lowest--it's far--you want to

00:43:25.881 --> 00:43:28.719
get to the left as far as
possible.

00:43:28.719 --> 00:43:30.757
You want to,
for any given expected return,

00:43:30.757 --> 00:43:32.989
you want to minimize the
standard deviation,

00:43:32.989 --> 00:43:36.778
so it's the left-most line and
that means that everyone will be

00:43:36.778 --> 00:43:40.588
holding the same portfolio.
I don't find that my analysis

00:43:40.588 --> 00:43:44.664
is profound in the final answer,
I just took some estimates

00:43:44.664 --> 00:43:47.881
using my data and,
again, we could--if someone

00:43:47.881 --> 00:43:51.750
wanted to argue with us they
could argue with my estimates of

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:55.233
the expected returns of the
standard deviations and the

00:43:55.233 --> 00:43:58.430
covariances,
but not with this theory.

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:02.582
This theory is very rigorous.
If you agree with my estimates,

00:44:02.582 --> 00:44:07.497
then you should do this as an
investor, you should hold only

00:44:07.497 --> 00:44:11.079
some mixture of this tangency
portfolio,

00:44:11.079 --> 00:44:15.690
which is 9% oil,
27% stocks, and 64% bonds.

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:18.146
You see what we've got here?
I started out with the

00:44:18.146 --> 00:44:21.488
equally-weighted--I was talking
about stocks--about n

00:44:21.488 --> 00:44:24.943
stocks that all have the same
variance and are all independent

00:44:24.943 --> 00:44:27.225
of each other.
But, I've dropped that

00:44:27.225 --> 00:44:30.623
assumption and now I'm going on
to assuming that they're taking

00:44:30.623 --> 00:44:33.090
account of their dependence on
each other,

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:35.990
taking account of their
different expected returns,

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:39.007
and taking account of their
different covariances and

00:44:39.007 --> 00:44:41.390
variances;
so that's what we've got.

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:44.252
This is a famous framework.
This diagram is,

00:44:44.252 --> 00:44:48.115
I think, the most famous
diagram in all of financial

00:44:48.115 --> 00:44:52.510
theory and it's actually the
first theoretical diagram.

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:56.512
I did it myself using my data,
but it would always look more

00:44:56.512 --> 00:45:00.310
or less like this--slightly
different positions if people

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:04.030
use different estimates.
I actually showed this

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:09.079
diagram--I went to Norway with
my colleague--I actually have a

00:45:09.079 --> 00:45:11.480
couple more pictures here.

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:20.523
That's my colleague,
Ronit Walny,

00:45:20.523 --> 00:45:25.500
and I, we're posing in front of
the Parliament Building in Oslo.

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:29.756
We went to Norway to discuss
the--with the Norwegian

00:45:29.756 --> 00:45:34.273
Government--their portfolio.
This is a slide that I showed

00:45:34.273 --> 00:45:36.913
them.
I showed them the slide that I

00:45:36.913 --> 00:45:40.322
just showed you,
showing the optimal portfolio,

00:45:40.322 --> 00:45:44.769
and then I looked at the
Norwegian Government's position.

00:45:44.769 --> 00:45:51.358
The Norwegian Government has
pension fund assets in the

00:45:51.358 --> 00:45:56.847
amount of, as of 2006,
just under two trillion

00:45:56.847 --> 00:46:03.800
Norwegian Kroner;
but they also own North Sea Oil.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.911
If you know that,
it's kind of divided between

00:46:05.911 --> 00:46:09.016
the UK and Norway.
Norway has a much smaller

00:46:09.016 --> 00:46:14.216
population than the UK and they
have a lot of oil up there in

00:46:14.216 --> 00:46:19.215
the North Sea.
As of then, I calculated the

00:46:19.215 --> 00:46:27.020
value of their oil in the North
Sea and that's what I got--it's

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:32.560
worth about 3.5 billion
Norwegian Kroner.

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:37.135
Do you see the difference?
In fact, the assets that the

00:46:37.135 --> 00:46:41.585
Norwegian Government owns is
about two-thirds oil and

00:46:41.585 --> 00:46:45.349
one-third government pension
fund assets.

00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:48.927
This government pension fund,
I guess, in dollars,

00:46:48.927 --> 00:46:53.043
is about $200 billion.
It's a huge amount of money

00:46:53.043 --> 00:46:57.419
that they're managing,
but I was trying to convince

00:46:57.419 --> 00:47:02.058
them that they should do
something to manage their oil

00:47:02.058 --> 00:47:06.610
risks because they're way
over-invested in oil.

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:08.670
Where are they on the efficient
portfolio frontier?

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:27.410
They have 64% oil in their
portfolio.

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:30.449
Where does that put them?
Well it's not--it's really off

00:47:30.449 --> 00:47:32.939
the diagram.
The furthest point that I

00:47:32.939 --> 00:47:37.452
recorded was 28% oil--that puts
them there--so if they--if you

00:47:37.452 --> 00:47:41.092
wanted to, where would it be?
It would be somewhere over

00:47:41.092 --> 00:47:44.348
there off the charts.
What the Norwegian Government

00:47:44.348 --> 00:47:48.105
is doing wrong is--it's a little
bit controversial,

00:47:48.105 --> 00:47:53.057
my pointing this out to them.
I ended up in the newspaper the

00:47:53.057 --> 00:47:57.658
next day for having argued that
they are way off on their

00:47:57.658 --> 00:48:03.000
investment opportunities because
oil is such a volatile thing.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.460
They've got so much of their
assets tied up in oil.

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:09.866
I got a good hearing.
I went to the Ministry of

00:48:09.866 --> 00:48:13.271
Finance and we went to the
Norges Bank, which is their

00:48:13.271 --> 00:48:16.526
central bank,
and I think the answer I got

00:48:16.526 --> 00:48:19.150
from them was,
yes you're right.

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:23.230
I never got it quite like
that--something like that.

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:26.568
There was a conditional
agreement: yes,

00:48:26.568 --> 00:48:31.312
Norway should manage this oil
risk but it's politically

00:48:31.312 --> 00:48:36.144
difficult and that's the
problem--is that we're not able

00:48:36.144 --> 00:48:40.703
to do our optimal management.
Maybe there are a number of

00:48:40.703 --> 00:48:44.055
structural problems that prevent
them from doing that and they

00:48:44.055 --> 00:48:46.802
think,
maybe, that--I think Norway may

00:48:46.802 --> 00:48:50.290
be moving that way,
so we'll see in the future.

00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:55.952
I went to the Bank of Mexico;
I tried to convince the--I met

00:48:55.952 --> 00:48:59.225
the president of the Bank of
Mexico and tried to tell them

00:48:59.225 --> 00:49:01.349
that Mexico is too reliant on
oil,

00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:03.860
too much oil--they have to get
rid of their risk.

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:06.865
I'm going to the Russian
Stabilization Fund in--I think

00:49:06.865 --> 00:49:09.815
I've got an arrangement to meet
with them in Moscow in

00:49:09.815 --> 00:49:12.320
March--that would be during the
semester.

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:16.739
I'll tell you what reaction I
hope I get from the Russians.

00:49:16.739 --> 00:49:22.208
Oil is very important to the
Russian economy and are they

00:49:22.208 --> 00:49:26.539
managing the risk well?
I bet not.

00:49:26.539 --> 00:49:29.570
I'm going to do a diagram like
this for Russia.

00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:33.963
The countries that really
matter are the ones that--the

00:49:33.963 --> 00:49:37.380
Arabian--are the Persian Gulf
countries;

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:40.743
I was just talking to people at
the World Economic Forum about

00:49:40.743 --> 00:49:43.014
that.
Some of those countries are

00:49:43.014 --> 00:49:46.713
really reliant on oil,
so they really have to do--they

00:49:46.713 --> 00:49:50.343
really should do a calculation
of efficient portfolio

00:49:50.343 --> 00:49:53.065
frontiers.
Well, one of the lessons of

00:49:53.065 --> 00:49:55.609
this course is we have a
wonderful theory,

00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:58.030
but we don't manage it well,
mostly.

00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:00.030
And I don't mean to be
criticizing foreign countries.

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:03.570
The same criticism applies to
the United States as well.

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:06.604
We're in a different position.
Where are we on this frontier

00:50:06.604 --> 00:50:08.559
regarding oil in the United
States?

00:50:08.559 --> 00:50:11.999
Well, we don't have much oil
relative to the size of our

00:50:11.999 --> 00:50:13.710
portfolio.
I don't know what percent;

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:16.566
our oil reserves in the U.S.
are pretty small,

00:50:16.566 --> 00:50:21.106
so we're kind of lying
somewhere inside--maybe on this

00:50:21.106 --> 00:50:24.550
pink line.
So, people in the U.S.

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:26.860
don't have the optimal
portfolio either.

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:32.257
I set up a theoretical
framework here and I wanted to

00:50:32.257 --> 00:50:38.070
give you--I mentioned oil
because it seems to make it,

00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:41.679
to me, so clear what we're
talking about here.

00:50:41.679 --> 00:50:47.578
It's talking about not getting
tied up in risks and so--I was

00:50:47.578 --> 00:50:53.477
talking to someone at the World
Economic Forum from a Persian

00:50:53.477 --> 00:50:59.818
Gulf country and I said,
aren't you worried about

00:50:59.818 --> 00:51:04.182
reliance on oil?
He said, of course we're

00:51:04.182 --> 00:51:07.904
worried on reliance,
so much of our GDP and of our

00:51:07.904 --> 00:51:10.789
government revenues is
oil-related.

00:51:10.789 --> 00:51:13.710
We've seen the price of oil,
lately, move all over the map.

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:17.332
It went up to $100 recently and
it was just as late as late

00:51:17.332 --> 00:51:21.018
1990s that it was under $20 and
people just don't know where

00:51:21.018 --> 00:51:24.697
it's going to go.
I think that these countries

00:51:24.697 --> 00:51:29.855
are somewhat trying to manage
this oil risk but they can't yet

00:51:29.855 --> 00:51:36.307
get onto the frontier.
That's a sign to me that we're

00:51:36.307 --> 00:51:44.260
not there yet and we have a lot
more to do in finance.

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:50.863
There's one more equation that
I wanted to write down and I'm

00:51:50.863 --> 00:51:57.467
going to not--I'm not going to
spend a lot of time explaining

00:51:57.467 --> 00:52:02.199
this because it's going to take
awhile.

00:52:02.199 --> 00:52:07.300
This is the equation that
relates the expected return on

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:11.393
an asset.
It's so called capital asset

00:52:11.393 --> 00:52:16.937
pricing model.
In the capital asset pricing

00:52:16.937 --> 00:52:25.430
model, in finance--this is the
most famous model in finance.

00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:42.125
It's abbreviated as the CAPM
and I'm not going to do it

00:52:42.125 --> 00:52:44.996
justice here,
I'm sorry, but there are so

00:52:44.996 --> 00:52:49.873
many ins and outs of this.
You should really take ECON 251

00:52:49.873 --> 00:52:55.621
to learn this more.
It was--the model divided by

00:52:55.621 --> 00:53:03.320
James Tobin here at Yale,
was the original--who got the

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:09.467
original precursors,
but it was more invented by

00:53:09.467 --> 00:53:12.441
William Sharpe,
John Lintner,

00:53:12.441 --> 00:53:14.460
Harry Markowitz.

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:23.869
Everyone of these,
except Lintner I think,

00:53:23.869 --> 00:53:27.011
won the Nobel Prize.
I think he died too

00:53:27.011 --> 00:53:31.410
young--that's one of the
misfortunes of living.

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:36.486
Did I say that right?
One of the misfortunes of

00:53:36.486 --> 00:53:40.057
scholarship, you have to live
long enough to get your

00:53:40.057 --> 00:53:45.774
accolades.
The asset pricing model--and

00:53:45.774 --> 00:53:55.250
this is critical--assumes
everyone is rational and holds

00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:59.730
the tangency portfolio.

00:54:11.079 --> 00:54:15.069
That is a wild assumption,
but it's fun to make,

00:54:15.069 --> 00:54:19.822
because I know pretty well--I
know very well--that people

00:54:19.822 --> 00:54:23.085
aren't doing this.
They have lots of maybe

00:54:23.085 --> 00:54:25.938
good--maybe it's not because
they're irrational,

00:54:25.938 --> 00:54:29.700
it's that they're political or
they're constrained by tradition

00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:32.599
or laws or regulations,
all sorts of things;

00:54:32.599 --> 00:54:35.670
but, they're not holding the
tangency portfolio.

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:40.382
It's a beautiful theory to
assume, to see what would happen

00:54:40.382 --> 00:54:43.884
if they did.
That would mean that everybody

00:54:43.884 --> 00:54:48.535
is holding that same portfolio
of risky assets and nobody is

00:54:48.535 --> 00:54:51.388
different,
they're only different in

00:54:51.388 --> 00:54:55.339
how--what proportions they hold
the risky--the tangency

00:54:55.339 --> 00:55:00.384
portfolio.
It implies that the tangency

00:55:00.384 --> 00:55:08.866
portfolio has to equal the
actual market portfolio and that

00:55:08.866 --> 00:55:17.639
means then--it's a very simple
implication of the theory.

00:55:17.639 --> 00:55:20.950
In my diagram,
I said that the tangency

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:26.176
portfolio--I estimated that the
tangency portfolio is 9% oil,

00:55:26.176 --> 00:55:30.351
27% stocks, and 64% bonds.
If we're all doing that,

00:55:30.351 --> 00:55:33.280
then that has to be what the
outstanding is.

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:36.986
If we're all holding the same
portfolio, that has to be the

00:55:36.986 --> 00:55:40.630
total, so that would mean that
9% of all wealth is oil,

00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:46.758
9% of all--is oil--27% of all
wealth is stocks,

00:55:46.758 --> 00:55:51.510
and 64% is bonds.
If you accept my estimates and

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:54.619
you accept the capital asset
pricing model,

00:55:54.619 --> 00:55:58.662
that would have to be true.
Again, I don't want to make too

00:55:58.662 --> 00:56:02.129
much of my estimates because
different people would estimate

00:56:02.129 --> 00:56:05.480
these things in different ways,
but that's the theory.

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:09.746
The theory says that the
tangency portfolio equals the

00:56:09.746 --> 00:56:14.817
optimal portfolio and that gives
us the famous equation--I'm not

00:56:14.817 --> 00:56:18.937
going to derive this,
but there is the most famous

00:56:18.937 --> 00:56:22.400
equation in finance--says--can
you read that?

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:26.859
That r_i,
the expected return on the

00:56:26.859 --> 00:56:30.805
ith asset,
is equal to the riskless rate

00:56:30.805 --> 00:56:35.693
plus something called the beta
for the ith asset times the

00:56:35.693 --> 00:56:40.840
expected return on the market
minus the riskless rate.

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:49.530
Again, I'm not going to spend
much time on this,

00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:52.826
but the β
of the ith asset is the

00:56:52.826 --> 00:56:57.020
regression coefficient when you
regress the return on the

00:56:57.020 --> 00:57:01.590
ith asset on the return
of the market portfolio.

00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:12.383
r_m is the
expected return on the market

00:57:12.383 --> 00:57:22.019
portfolio, which is the
portfolio of all assets.

00:57:22.019 --> 00:57:25.425
The market portfolio is,
if you took all the stocks and

00:57:25.425 --> 00:57:27.570
bonds, and oil,
and real estate,

00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:31.091
anything that's available to
invest in, in the whole world,

00:57:31.091 --> 00:57:33.579
put them all together in one
portfolio.

00:57:33.579 --> 00:57:38.019
It's the world portfolio,
it's everything and we compute

00:57:38.019 --> 00:57:41.571
the expected return on that
portfolio, that's

00:57:41.571 --> 00:57:45.969
r_m.
Also, we need to know how much

00:57:45.969 --> 00:57:50.730
individual stocks are correlated
with r_m;

00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:52.889
we measure that by the
regression coefficient.

00:57:52.889 --> 00:57:58.081
The β of a stock is how
much it reacts to movements in

00:57:58.081 --> 00:58:01.395
the market portfolio.
If β = 1,

00:58:01.395 --> 00:58:06.505
it means that if the market
portfolio goes up 10% in value

00:58:06.505 --> 00:58:10.539
then this asset also goes up 10%
in value.

00:58:10.539 --> 00:58:14.871
If β is two,
it means that if the market

00:58:14.871 --> 00:58:19.991
goes up 10% in value,
the stock tends to go up 20% in

00:58:19.991 --> 00:58:24.774
value and so on.
These are the basic theoretical

00:58:24.774 --> 00:58:29.950
structures that you incidentally
need for the problem set,

00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:34.053
the first problem set.
The first problem set--I guess

00:58:34.053 --> 00:58:37.537
you've--you can turn in your
first problem set here before

00:58:37.537 --> 00:58:39.860
you leave because it was due
today.

00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:42.909
The second problem set is about
this model.

00:58:42.909 --> 00:58:46.079
I realize I've given you some
difficult mathematics,

00:58:46.079 --> 00:58:49.560
but--it's not that difficult
actually--but I kind of went

00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:54.464
through it quickly.
So, we are setting up our--you

00:58:54.464 --> 00:59:01.297
have already gotten email and
you've talked about setting up

00:59:01.297 --> 00:59:08.130
your review sessions--so I have
a few more minutes here.

00:59:08.130 --> 00:59:13.347
What I want to do,
I want to talk about Jeremy

00:59:13.347 --> 00:59:18.679
Siegel's book and the equity
premium puzzle.

00:59:18.679 --> 00:59:23.986
Underlying this analysis,
we have estimates of the

00:59:23.986 --> 00:59:30.050
expected returns on assets,
notably, the expected returns

00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:32.650
on stocks and bonds.

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:48.094
Jeremy Siegel,
in his book,

00:59:48.094 --> 00:59:53.962
which is assigned for this
course, is really emphasizing

00:59:53.962 --> 00:59:57.909
this capital asset pricing
model,

00:59:57.909 --> 01:00:00.655
emphasizing the kind of
efficient portfolio frontier

01:00:00.655 --> 01:00:04.494
calculations that I've done.
What Siegel emphasized--the

01:00:04.494 --> 01:00:09.520
book is really about this--he
talks about what is the expected

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:14.710
return of stocks and what is the
expected return of bonds and so

01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:19.079
on.
We're going to call asset one

01:00:19.079 --> 01:00:24.322
stocks in the U.S.
and we're going to call asset

01:00:24.322 --> 01:00:26.563
two bonds.
He estimates,

01:00:26.563 --> 01:00:30.718
for his purposes,
and he shows you calculations

01:00:30.718 --> 01:00:34.239
of the efficient portfolio
frontier.

01:00:34.239 --> 01:00:37.929
I want to just talk a little
bit about his estimate.

01:00:37.929 --> 01:00:46.212
He has data for a very long
time period, 1802 to 2006,

01:00:46.212 --> 01:00:48.400
for the U.S.

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:10.140
Over that very long time
interval, the expected return

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:19.815
that we got for stocks was 6.8%
a year in real terms,

01:01:19.815 --> 01:01:26.699
this is real inflation
corrected;

01:01:26.699 --> 01:01:33.994
whereas, for bonds,
it was, over this whole time

01:01:33.994 --> 01:01:38.340
period, 2.8% a year,
real.

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:39.996
Then he also computes
σ_1 and

01:01:39.996 --> 01:01:42.037
σ_2 and
σ_12 but I'm not

01:01:42.037 --> 01:01:43.539
going to talk about that right
now.

01:01:43.539 --> 01:01:47.860
Then he computes the efficient
portfolio frontier.

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.817
Now, he's using a much longer
sample than I did,

01:01:50.817 --> 01:01:54.719
so he's not going to get this
tangency portfolio that I did.

01:01:54.719 --> 01:02:00.116
The thing that is very
interesting that he finds is the

01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:04.313
difference, 4%,
between the historical real

01:02:04.313 --> 01:02:10.409
return on stocks and the
historical real return on bonds.

01:02:10.409 --> 01:02:12.360
This is called the equity
premium.

01:02:18.519 --> 01:02:21.521
Actually, I should take that
back, this is really

01:02:21.521 --> 01:02:24.210
r_f--he shows
all three.

01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:27.519
r_f that I'm
reporting is the riskless rate.

01:02:27.519 --> 01:02:31.915
There's also--if you look on
Table One in Chapter One,

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:35.150
it shows r_1
stocks,

01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:40.121
r_2 long-term
bonds, and these are short-term

01:02:40.121 --> 01:02:45.754
that I'm recording here.
The equity premium is the--this

01:02:45.754 --> 01:02:51.648
short-term 2.8% is the riskless
return, historically,

01:02:51.648 --> 01:02:55.730
for a period of almost 200
years.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:03:00.398
This is the return on stocks
for a period of almost 200

01:03:00.398 --> 01:03:04.526
years.
Stocks have paid 4% more a year

01:03:04.526 --> 01:03:11.289
over this incredibly long time
period than short-term bonds.

01:03:11.289 --> 01:03:14.764
Also, they've paid much more
than long-term--well it's not so

01:03:14.764 --> 01:03:17.281
different.
I don't have the data in front

01:03:17.281 --> 01:03:20.135
of me, so let's emphasize the
difference between

01:03:20.135 --> 01:03:23.110
r_1 and
r_f.

01:03:23.110 --> 01:03:27.979
It surprises many people that
stocks have paid such an

01:03:27.979 --> 01:03:32.940
enormous premium over the return
on short-term debt.

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:41.230
The theme of Siegel's book is,
can we believe this?

01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:44.742
I mean, do you really--you
might wonder,

01:03:44.742 --> 01:03:50.327
aren't people missing something
if the excess return is so high

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:55.904
of stocks over short-term bonds?
Why would anyone not just hold

01:03:55.904 --> 01:03:59.250
a lot of--a really large number
of stocks?

01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:02.328
That's the theme of his book
and his book is at--his

01:04:02.328 --> 01:04:05.889
conclusion is that he largely
believes that this is true,

01:04:05.889 --> 01:04:10.710
that the returns that we have
seen in the U.S.

01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:16.172
in the stock market have
exceeded those of other assets

01:04:16.172 --> 01:04:21.052
by quite a substantial margin.
That means--his calculations

01:04:21.052 --> 01:04:24.572
are very different than the ones
I have because he has a much

01:04:24.572 --> 01:04:27.878
longer sample period.
I was using only from 1983 to

01:04:27.878 --> 01:04:31.102
the present.
For him, the optimal portfolio

01:04:31.102 --> 01:04:33.949
should be very heavily into
stocks.

01:04:33.949 --> 01:04:37.322
Now, this is a controversial
view, but that is the view that

01:04:37.322 --> 01:04:40.637
he advances in the book and I
think it's a very interesting

01:04:40.637 --> 01:04:44.051
analysis.
So, what it means then is that

01:04:44.051 --> 01:04:49.039
the optimal portfolio should not
be the one I show there,

01:04:49.039 --> 01:04:53.760
but should be one that's very
heavily into stocks.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:05:03.883
This is--I'm showing here U.S.
data, but Siegel also argues in

01:05:03.883 --> 01:05:11.168
the latest edition that the
equity premium is also high for

01:05:11.168 --> 01:05:16.570
advanced countries over the
whole world.

01:05:16.570 --> 01:05:20.473
If you look at his book,
again in the first chapter,

01:05:20.473 --> 01:05:23.917
he gives a list of
countries--it's based on an

01:05:23.917 --> 01:05:28.050
analysis that some others--that
Professors Dimson,

01:05:28.050 --> 01:05:33.480
Marsh, and Stanton used in
their 2002 book.

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:40.127
They show the expected return
on stocks versus bonds or

01:05:40.127 --> 01:05:46.159
short-term debt for a whole
range of countries.

01:05:46.159 --> 01:05:49.743
In every one of these
countries, since 1901,

01:05:49.743 --> 01:05:53.409
there has been a very high
equity premium.

01:05:53.409 --> 01:05:56.617
I'll let you read Siegel and
his discussion of this

01:05:56.617 --> 01:06:00.145
possibility, but I think
that--what I want to get now is

01:06:00.145 --> 01:06:04.251
not necessarily any agreement on
whether you believe that there's

01:06:04.251 --> 01:06:07.010
such a high excess return for
stocks.

01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:10.019
but I just want you to
understand the basic framework.

01:06:10.019 --> 01:06:15.328
The first problem set asked you
to manipulate the model that I

01:06:15.328 --> 01:06:20.463
just presented--the model of how
you form portfolios and the

01:06:20.463 --> 01:06:24.380
model of the capital asset
pricing model.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:27.409
I have one final question,
just about the mutual fund

01:06:27.409 --> 01:06:30.087
industry.
The mutual fund industry is

01:06:30.087 --> 01:06:34.389
supposedly, and according to
theory, doing this for you.

01:06:34.389 --> 01:06:37.394
The ideal thing would be that
the mutual fund does these

01:06:37.394 --> 01:06:40.179
calculations and it puts it all
together for you.

01:06:40.179 --> 01:06:43.646
At least in some approximate
sense that's what they are

01:06:43.646 --> 01:06:45.814
doing.
I asked you in the final

01:06:45.814 --> 01:06:50.226
question to just get on a couple
of websites, The Federal Reserve

01:06:50.226 --> 01:06:53.712
and the ICI,
which is a mutual industry

01:06:53.712 --> 01:06:59.559
website, and write a little bit,
a couple paragraphs about what

01:06:59.559 --> 01:07:05.030
this industry is really
achieving or how it's trending.

01:07:05.030 --> 01:07:08.837
Next Wednesday–well,
there are three lectures this

01:07:08.837 --> 01:07:12.992
week, Wednesday will be about
the insurance industry and I'll

01:07:12.992 --> 01:07:14.725
see you in two days then.

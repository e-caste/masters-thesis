00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.849
Prof: Someone asked me
at the end of class on Tuesday a

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:07.436
very good question,
and the question is:

00:00:07.436 --> 00:00:09.520
what exactly is a broadside?
 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.041
So I was here sort of happily
like: 'oh, yes,

00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:15.135
they're posting broadsides,
don't buy tea,' and I never

00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:18.000
really precisely defined what a
broadside was.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.360
A broadside is actually a
single sheet of paper that

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.833
something is printed on one side
and it would have been posted in

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:33.220
public or handed out in public
in town squares or taverns,

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.646
and usually they were
advertising things or announcing

00:00:36.646 --> 00:00:39.915
things that were of immediate,
pressing importance like

00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:41.594
immediate news,
pressing news,

00:00:41.594 --> 00:00:44.280
political events,
official proclamations,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.160
great entertainment or whatever.
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.033
They were sort of immediate
news and they were not really

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:51.880
seen as great permanent
documents.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.680
They were seen as something
that you posted up,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.525
you handed out,
you read it for the day or

00:00:55.525 --> 00:00:57.460
whatever and then it would be
discarded,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.719
so that was these broadsides
that I was talking about.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.764
'The detested tea has arrived
at our port' would have been

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:05.420
that kind of an announcement.
 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.715
It would have been an immediate
like: 'the tea's here now,

00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:11.549
do something,' kind of an
instant announcement.

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.030
So that's what a broadside is.
 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.623
Okay.
 

00:01:13.623 --> 00:01:20.757
So today we are going to make
our way to what on the syllabus

00:01:20.757 --> 00:01:25.750
I have called the logic of
resistance,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.569
and what I mean by that is the
mindset that contributed to some

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:35.077
of the broad conclusions that
the colonists were drawing as

00:01:35.077 --> 00:01:39.663
events were unfolding in the
1770s as we've seen in the last

00:01:39.663 --> 00:01:41.140
few lectures.
 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.171
But to get to the logic of
resistance we first have to lay

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:48.849
out another event that
contributed to the building of

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:49.910
that logic.
 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.800
And I mentioned it right at the
end of the last lecture--

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.170
and that event is a series of
acts that were passed by

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.753
Parliament in 1774,
and Americans ended up calling

00:02:02.753 --> 00:02:06.338
them the Intolerable Acts,
which will be an easy way to

00:02:06.338 --> 00:02:09.068
remember what they are,
the Intolerable Acts.

00:02:09.068 --> 00:02:11.950
They also were called the
Coercive Acts but intolerable

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.564
would have been what
Americans--what the colonists

00:02:14.564 --> 00:02:16.218
would have considered them.
 

00:02:16.218 --> 00:02:19.740
And I mentioned them right at
the end of the last lecture.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.375
As you remember,
they were a response to the

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:25.008
destruction of the tea in Boston
Harbor,

00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:30.240
which sort of dumbfounded Lord
North who had assumed that his

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.250
Tea Act,
passed in 1773,

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.169
was going to be seen as maybe a
relief by the colonies;

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.976
that North had been trying to
save the East India Company from

00:02:38.976 --> 00:02:41.256
going under;
he had reduced duties on East

00:02:41.256 --> 00:02:44.190
India tea so that people would
be buying that tea,

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.291
passed the act,
thought this would be seen

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:49.747
potentially as a good thing--
only to find that the colonists

00:02:49.747 --> 00:02:53.062
saw it as an attempt of the
British government to have a

00:02:53.062 --> 00:02:56.860
monopoly over what the colonists
had assumed was free trade.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.483
And that's where you get the
broadsides that I was just

00:02:59.483 --> 00:03:02.192
talking about,
telling people not to buy or

00:03:02.192 --> 00:03:04.680
sell East India tea and to act
now,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.818
defend your liberties.
 

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:09.576
And then eventually you end up
with the destruction of tea in

00:03:09.576 --> 00:03:10.580
Boston Harbor.
 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.906
And as I mentioned in the last
lecture, "Boston Tea

00:03:12.906 --> 00:03:15.360
Party" is actually later in
the nineteenth century.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.188
They didn't call it this at the
time.

00:03:17.188 --> 00:03:19.479
They probably called it
"the destruction of the

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:21.320
tea," but it was not a
party [laughs]

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.038
at the time.
 

00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:23.680
That was later they decided it
was a tea party.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.979
So now clearly,
having had that happen,

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:31.348
North felt that something
really needed to be done about

00:03:31.348 --> 00:03:34.586
the colonies,
or obedience to British law and

00:03:34.586 --> 00:03:35.865
order,
in his mind,

00:03:35.865 --> 00:03:37.720
would collapse in the colonies.
 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.188
As he put it,
and I think I quoted this right

00:03:40.188 --> 00:03:42.994
at the end of the lecture,
that if they didn't risk

00:03:42.994 --> 00:03:44.509
something, all is over.
 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:46.038
A dramatic statement.
 

00:03:46.038 --> 00:03:50.280
Thus you get the Intolerable
Acts, which are passed in the

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.964
spring of 1774,
and although there were some in

00:03:53.964 --> 00:03:56.990
Parliament who protested against
them,

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.780
still they passed with a great
majority.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.318
Those who did protest against
them argued that the American

00:04:04.318 --> 00:04:07.610
colonists deserved the same
rights as any other British

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.342
subjects and,
as I describe the acts to you,

00:04:10.342 --> 00:04:13.554
you will understand why these
friends to America were making

00:04:13.554 --> 00:04:14.479
this argument.
 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.533
You'll hear the details and see
that their argument certainly

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:18.959
made sense at that moment.
 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.242
So there were four acts that
get lumped together as the

00:04:23.242 --> 00:04:24.750
Intolerable Acts.
 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.160
The first one:
the Boston Port Act,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.685
which closed the port of Boston
to all shipping until the

00:04:33.685 --> 00:04:38.050
colonists paid for the tea that
they had destroyed,

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.603
and I suppose also hopefully
showed some degree of remorse

00:04:41.603 --> 00:04:43.850
for having destroyed all that
tea.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.142
Now clearly that's a pretty
extreme measure,

00:04:47.142 --> 00:04:50.589
right?--closing the port of
Boston, period.

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:55.697
And North assumed that it would
pretty much crush the opposition

00:04:55.697 --> 00:04:59.831
in Boston and that other
colonies would scramble for

00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:05.019
Boston's lost trade and ignore
what was happening in Boston.

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:06.910
And we'll see this again and
again--

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.233
that there is sort of a
fundamental misunderstanding

00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:11.831
about when and what ends up
seeming like a joint threat to

00:05:11.831 --> 00:05:14.473
the colonists so that they act
together versus what doesn't

00:05:14.473 --> 00:05:16.069
inspire them to act together.
 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:18.745
So here we see Lord North
assuming that if Boston loses

00:05:18.745 --> 00:05:21.619
trade the other colonies will
just sort of gobble it up and

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:24.740
the Boston radicals will sort of
get silenced and that'll be the

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.447
end of this matter,
but he misjudges colonial

00:05:27.447 --> 00:05:29.379
sentiment,
in this case really

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:33.327
underestimating the sense of
unity that arises from something

00:05:33.327 --> 00:05:36.290
that ends up being seen as a
joint threat.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.930
So the British government ends
up being rather stunned when the

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.396
other colonies not only don't
ignore Boston but instead they

00:05:43.396 --> 00:05:45.980
actually support it in its time
of need.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.444
So other colonies responded to
the Boston Port Act and some of

00:05:49.444 --> 00:05:51.490
these other acts by sending
goods.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.584
So Connecticut sent sheep,
Charleston sent rice,

00:05:55.584 --> 00:05:57.850
Philadelphia sent flour.
 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.749
So the other colonies basically
stepped up and did something in

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:05.459
Boston's time of need and a lot
of colonies made June 1,

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:08.420
which is the day that that act
was supposed to take effect,

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.670
a day of fasting and prayer.
 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.619
Now clearly some of this was
because people felt sympathy for

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:19.148
what was happening in Boston;
they saw and felt for Boston

00:06:19.148 --> 00:06:20.569
and its plight.
 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:23.956
But equally if not more
important, people in other

00:06:23.956 --> 00:06:27.064
colonies assumed if it could
happen in Boston,

00:06:27.064 --> 00:06:29.069
it could happen anywhere.
 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:33.759
So in a lot of ways,
Boston's cause was their cause.

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.589
It wasn't something happening
far away.

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:38.483
It was something that there was
no reason why they couldn't see

00:06:38.483 --> 00:06:41.283
it couldn't happen anywhere else
where the British government

00:06:41.283 --> 00:06:43.709
happened to be angry at
something that happened.

00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:47.718
So in essence Lord North's
actions did the precise opposite

00:06:47.718 --> 00:06:52.028
of what they were meant to do,
because they really ultimately

00:06:52.028 --> 00:06:55.812
brought the colonies closer
together in a shared sense of

00:06:55.812 --> 00:06:56.490
crisis.
 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.704
As George Washington put it in
his typical kind of meandering,

00:07:00.704 --> 00:07:04.850
indirect way--Washington is not
always the best wordsmith.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.829
Washington had very good people
writing for him.

00:07:06.829 --> 00:07:09.278
He had good speech makers,
that Washington,

00:07:09.278 --> 00:07:12.060
but he tends to write in kind
of a meandering style,

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.363
and this will be kind of a
typical Washingtonian statement

00:07:15.363 --> 00:07:17.740
full of parenthesis and weird
clauses,

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.459
but his heart's in the right
place.

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:19.692
Okay.
 

00:07:19.692 --> 00:07:21.744
So Washington says,
"The ministry,"

00:07:21.744 --> 00:07:24.139
the British ministry,
"may rely on it,

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:27.769
the Americans will never be
tax'd without their own consent,

00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:31.047
that the cause of Boston,
the despotick Measures in

00:07:31.047 --> 00:07:33.625
respect to it I mean,
now is and ever will be

00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:35.942
considerd as the cause of
America (not that we approve

00:07:35.942 --> 00:07:38.480
their conduct in destroying the
Tea)," this is all one

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.122
sentence [laughs]--
and that "we shall not

00:07:41.122 --> 00:07:44.307
suffer ourselves to be
sacrificed by piece meals though

00:07:44.307 --> 00:07:47.139
god only knows what is to become
of us."

00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:49.151
It's sort of a Washingtonian
sentence but still,

00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:50.819
he's making his point really
clearly.

00:07:50.819 --> 00:07:54.706
So the Boston Port Act,
number one of the Intolerable

00:07:54.706 --> 00:07:55.230
Acts.
 

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.452
The other three--still pretty
largely focused on

00:07:58.452 --> 00:08:01.911
Massachusetts--
included a Quartering Act,

00:08:01.911 --> 00:08:06.232
and the Quartering Act
legalized the quartering of

00:08:06.232 --> 00:08:11.874
British troops not only in empty
buildings or taverns but also in

00:08:11.874 --> 00:08:15.961
private homes;
the Administration of Justice

00:08:15.961 --> 00:08:20.786
Act, which was an attempt to
protect people who were trying

00:08:20.786 --> 00:08:24.028
to suppress revolts in the
colonies.

00:08:24.028 --> 00:08:27.870
So the Administration of
Justice Act said that if a fair

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.851
trial for a British soldier or
official couldn't be had in

00:08:31.851 --> 00:08:36.008
Massachusetts,
the trial could be transferred

00:08:36.008 --> 00:08:39.120
to another colony or to England.
 

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.322
And in Massachusetts,
the land of propaganda,

00:08:42.322 --> 00:08:45.090
this became known as the Murder
Act.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.421
[laughs]
Just in case you want to wonder

00:08:46.421 --> 00:08:47.649
what people are thinking about
it.

00:08:47.649 --> 00:08:49.879
And as someone at the time put
it,

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:52.404
"Every villain who
ravishes our wives or deflowers

00:08:52.404 --> 00:08:54.818
our daughters,
can evade punishment by being

00:08:54.818 --> 00:08:57.897
tried in Britain,
where no evidence can pursue

00:08:57.897 --> 00:08:58.690
him."
 

00:08:58.690 --> 00:08:58.940
Okay.
 

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.496
We're not really talking so
much about ravishing and

00:09:01.496 --> 00:09:02.250
deflowering.
 

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.263
We're really talking about
[laughs]

00:09:04.263 --> 00:09:07.009
taxes and such--
but still, you could understand

00:09:07.009 --> 00:09:10.398
the logic why people feel that--
again--some fundamental

00:09:10.398 --> 00:09:12.830
liberties are being violated
here.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.806
And then finally the last of
these acts is the Massachusetts

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:20.543
Government Act,
and in a lot of ways that ended

00:09:20.543 --> 00:09:24.210
up being the most controversial
act of all,

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.759
because it basically imposed a
new charter on the colony of

00:09:27.759 --> 00:09:28.740
Massachusetts.
 

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.201
From now on,
the governor,

00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:36.251
who was appointed by the King,
could appoint his own council

00:09:36.251 --> 00:09:39.734
rather than having the council
be elected by the colonial

00:09:39.734 --> 00:09:43.155
assembly;
the council could no longer

00:09:43.155 --> 00:09:48.633
veto the governor's decisions;
all town meetings besides the

00:09:48.633 --> 00:09:53.275
one annual meeting for electing
officers now needed to be

00:09:53.275 --> 00:09:57.465
approved by the governor,
and if the governor wanted he

00:09:57.465 --> 00:09:59.620
could simply forbid town
meetings;

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.966
and any additional meeting
besides the one in which

00:10:02.966 --> 00:10:06.849
officers were chosen--that
meeting needed to post an agenda

00:10:06.849 --> 00:10:09.460
in advance and stick to the
agenda;

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.932
and the governor also now could
appoint or remove sheriffs,

00:10:12.932 --> 00:10:15.210
judges, attorney generals,
marshals.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.216
So basically the governor is a
royal official and the governor

00:10:18.216 --> 00:10:20.830
is now in Massachusetts being
given a lot of power.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.274
So I'll repeat the four
Intolerable Acts:

00:10:23.274 --> 00:10:25.794
the Boston Port Act,
the Quartering Act,

00:10:25.794 --> 00:10:27.908
the Administration of Justice
Act,

00:10:27.908 --> 00:10:31.629
and the Massachusetts
Government Act.

00:10:31.629 --> 00:10:35.082
So having described those acts,
you can see why there would

00:10:35.082 --> 00:10:38.655
have been some in Parliament who
were sympathetic to what was

00:10:38.655 --> 00:10:42.168
going on in the colonies who
would have protested that these

00:10:42.168 --> 00:10:45.563
acts were depriving colonists of
some pretty basic British

00:10:45.563 --> 00:10:49.043
constitutional rights,
but these protestors were in

00:10:49.043 --> 00:10:49.860
the minority.
 

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:54.831
Now on top of these acts the
King sent a new governor to

00:10:54.831 --> 00:10:58.592
Massachusetts,
Massachusetts General Thomas

00:10:58.592 --> 00:11:03.038
Gage, commander of the British
forces in North America.

00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:03.293
Okay.
 

00:11:03.293 --> 00:11:05.585
So a military commander was
sent to be the new

00:11:05.585 --> 00:11:08.028
governor--again,
a pretty dramatic statement.

00:11:08.028 --> 00:11:11.129
So now in addition to all of
those acts,

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:14.615
you have the looming threat
certainly to the colonies or the

00:11:14.615 --> 00:11:18.102
colonists in Massachusetts of a
standing army as a source of

00:11:18.102 --> 00:11:20.288
tyranny staring them in the
face.

00:11:20.288 --> 00:11:23.375
So certainly people in
Massachusetts at this moment

00:11:23.375 --> 00:11:26.768
would have been justified in
feeling as though they were

00:11:26.768 --> 00:11:28.620
under military occupation.
 

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:34.442
Now we may look at these pretty
drastic measures and assume that

00:11:34.442 --> 00:11:39.250
reconciliation is pretty
impossible at this point.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:42.416
And I know a few of you came up
to me after class on Tuesday and

00:11:42.416 --> 00:11:44.980
actually were already leaning in
that direction--

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.509
like, 'when are we getting the
independence,

00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:49.320
because how in the world can
they get out of this?'

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:49.666
Right?
 

00:11:49.666 --> 00:11:51.690
[laughs]
'It's looking pretty bad.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.200
Look at these really extreme
measures.'

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.918
Certainly it looks as though
rebellion is on the horizon.

00:11:56.918 --> 00:12:01.840
But independence is not the
natural choice.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.081
That's a really,
really radical move that is not

00:12:05.081 --> 00:12:07.288
at this moment on the horizon.
 

00:12:07.288 --> 00:12:09.513
These are really--And I'm going
to talk more about this in this

00:12:09.513 --> 00:12:10.590
lecture a little further on.
 

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:14.606
These are British subjects
trying to demand the rights of

00:12:14.606 --> 00:12:15.970
British subjects.
 

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.428
That's the logic that's at play
here.

00:12:17.428 --> 00:12:20.129
They're not thinking
independence.

00:12:20.129 --> 00:12:23.647
They're thinking that they need
to find a way to get the British

00:12:23.647 --> 00:12:27.220
imperial system to work in a way
that they see as being right.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.860
They're not trying to break
away.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.370
They're hoping that there's a
way to fix things,

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.148
and that they will get what
they feel they deserve as

00:12:35.148 --> 00:12:36.269
British subjects.
 

00:12:36.269 --> 00:12:43.011
So in 1774, it was in the hope
of maybe figuring out some way

00:12:43.011 --> 00:12:46.692
to settle things,
some way to compromise,

00:12:46.692 --> 00:12:49.870
some way to come to some sort
of a solution that the

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.607
Massachusetts legislature sent a
circular letter to the other

00:12:53.607 --> 00:12:57.159
colonies suggesting that it
might be smart to have a joint

00:12:57.159 --> 00:13:01.023
congress from all the colonies
to discuss their problems and to

00:13:01.023 --> 00:13:04.450
figure out a course of action
that made sense.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:08.626
So what came to be known as the
First Continental Congress,

00:13:08.626 --> 00:13:12.732
right?--the congress of the
continent--met in Philadelphia

00:13:12.732 --> 00:13:15.110
at the end of August in 1774.
 

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:19.315
Most of the delegates to that
Congress already had some

00:13:19.315 --> 00:13:23.210
political experience in their
separate colonies.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:27.591
None of them were absolute
uncompromising radicals who

00:13:27.591 --> 00:13:30.320
wanted to rip everything apart.
 

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.870
It was not a sort of dire
radical body,

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.999
and I'll be talking a little
bit more about the First

00:13:36.999 --> 00:13:40.428
Continental Congress in a
lecture to come but for now,

00:13:40.428 --> 00:13:45.408
I'll just state--I guess--four
significant things about the

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:47.639
meeting of the Congress.
 

00:13:47.639 --> 00:13:48.046
Okay.
 

00:13:48.046 --> 00:13:51.700
First, and it's actually kind
of practical,

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.683
the meeting of the First
Continental Congress forced the

00:13:54.683 --> 00:13:57.668
colonists to make their beliefs
clear to themselves--

00:13:57.668 --> 00:14:01.038
as people from a variety of
different colonies--

00:14:01.038 --> 00:14:04.759
and to Great Britain,
and to explain the motives

00:14:04.759 --> 00:14:09.269
behind their actions as they
debated and drafted petitions

00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:11.960
and resolves and declarations.
 

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.918
The delegates were clarifying
and defining their thoughts,

00:14:15.918 --> 00:14:19.100
and they were doing it in a
room full of delegates from

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.278
other colonies that people
didn't necessarily know that

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:22.808
well.
 

00:14:22.808 --> 00:14:25.129
So it was actually just in and
of itself by collecting all

00:14:25.129 --> 00:14:27.490
these people together in a room
and forcing them to sort of

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.466
think things through,
talk things through and come up

00:14:30.466 --> 00:14:34.174
with some kind of a resolution
they were actually hashing out

00:14:34.174 --> 00:14:38.008
their problems on a broad level
in a way that they had not done

00:14:38.008 --> 00:14:38.750
before.
 

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:43.500
Second, a Continental Congress
forced people from very separate

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.020
colonies--
in a way, really sort of

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.355
separate nation-states--
to meet one another and stay

00:14:49.355 --> 00:14:52.269
with one another for an extended
period of time.

00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:54.832
And for a lot of the people
that were there,

00:14:54.832 --> 00:14:57.991
this was really their first
extended period spent with

00:14:57.991 --> 00:14:59.960
people from faraway colonies.
 

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.519
So not only did this contribute
to a sense of colonial unity,

00:15:04.519 --> 00:15:07.048
but it actually on a really
practical level,

00:15:07.048 --> 00:15:10.673
it gave people a chance to see
how other colonies ran their

00:15:10.673 --> 00:15:12.110
colonial governments.
 

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.306
And John Adams actually--He
writes a great diary at the

00:15:15.306 --> 00:15:17.158
time,
and in his diary he writes

00:15:17.158 --> 00:15:20.236
about how when he's in this
congress he spent a lot of time

00:15:20.236 --> 00:15:22.360
grilling people from other
colonies,

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.820
asking questions about their
charters,

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.028
their laws, the logic behind
them.

00:15:27.028 --> 00:15:30.418
He really wanted to understand
how other colonies worked.

00:15:30.418 --> 00:15:32.879
And it's interesting because in
his letters--

00:15:32.879 --> 00:15:35.620
I think also in his diary but
in his letters for sure--

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:39.899
Adams refers to himself and his
position in the Continental

00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:42.481
Congress as "our
embassy,"

00:15:42.481 --> 00:15:43.220
right?
 

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.720
And by "our embassy,"
what he means is,

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.883
he sees himself as a kind of
diplomat representing

00:15:47.883 --> 00:15:50.851
Massachusetts in a sort of--
today you might

00:15:50.851 --> 00:15:54.340
say--international body,
but he sees the Continental

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.928
Congress as a sort of grouping
of representatives of other

00:15:57.928 --> 00:16:00.700
provinces or other countries or
nations,

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.629
and he's a delegate from our
embassy of Massachusetts.

00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:07.491
So in a way we put a lot of
baggage into the word

00:16:07.491 --> 00:16:09.519
"congress"
as though,

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:12.530
'oh, it's a bunch of Americans
joined in a congress,' but it's

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.950
not a Congress in our modern
sense of the word.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:19.125
It really is in their mind a
sort of delegation of people

00:16:19.125 --> 00:16:22.110
representing different
nation-states,

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.924
which is why it was so
interesting for them to collect

00:16:24.924 --> 00:16:27.048
together and get to exchange
thoughts.

00:16:27.048 --> 00:16:30.700
And then third,
to John Adams and some others,

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.808
the fact that now this Congress
existed seemed to be,

00:16:34.808 --> 00:16:37.330
or at least to hold the
potential for being,

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.940
some kind of a training ground
for American statesmen.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:45.510
And Adams put it at the time,
said that the Congress was

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.533
quote,
"to be a School of

00:16:47.533 --> 00:16:51.370
Political Prophets I suppose--
a Nursery of American Statesmen.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:53.831
May it thrive,
and prosper and flourish and

00:16:53.831 --> 00:16:56.529
from this Fountain may there
issue Streams,

00:16:56.529 --> 00:16:58.683
which shall gladden all the
Cities and Towns in North

00:16:58.683 --> 00:16:59.720
America, forever."
 

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.668
John Adams always has a way of
saying the big,

00:17:01.668 --> 00:17:03.923
broad quotable thing,
which is why I keep coming back

00:17:03.923 --> 00:17:04.400
to him.
 

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:04.644
Hello.
 

00:17:04.644 --> 00:17:06.481
I will provide you the
historian with the big,

00:17:06.481 --> 00:17:08.809
broad, wonderful quote about
the Continental Congress.

00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:10.160
Thank you, John Adams.
 

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.880
"I am for making...
 

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.482
the congress annual,
and for Sending an entire new

00:17:14.482 --> 00:17:17.786
set of delegates every Year,
that all the principal Genius's

00:17:17.786 --> 00:17:19.868
may go to the University in
Rotation--

00:17:19.868 --> 00:17:22.490
that We may have Politicians in
Plenty...

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.532
Our Policy must be to improve
every opportunity and Means for

00:17:25.532 --> 00:17:28.375
forming our People,
and preparing Leaders for them

00:17:28.375 --> 00:17:30.618
in the grand March of
Politicks."

00:17:30.618 --> 00:17:33.409
So he's drawing a lot of big
hopes for the future from the

00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:35.630
meeting of this Congress,
but certainly he's

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.181
thinking--the fact that it
exists and that these people

00:17:38.181 --> 00:17:41.016
will be meeting and talking in
this way on this level will be

00:17:41.016 --> 00:17:44.038
in and of itself a sort of
educational colonial experience.

00:17:44.038 --> 00:17:48.092
And then finally a fourth
significant aspect of the

00:17:48.092 --> 00:17:52.711
meeting of this Congress was
that at least to some back in

00:17:52.711 --> 00:17:57.333
England the Continental Congress
symbolized a move towards

00:17:57.333 --> 00:17:58.630
rebellion.
 

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:01.670
And indeed more about this to
come,

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.931
but in February of 1775,
Lord North passed a resolution

00:18:04.931 --> 00:18:08.493
in Parliament declaring that
Massachusetts was in a state of

00:18:08.493 --> 00:18:09.338
rebellion.
 

00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:12.877
And part of the reason why it's
Massachusetts that he's focusing

00:18:12.877 --> 00:18:15.348
on is because really still in
Parliament,

00:18:15.348 --> 00:18:17.971
they are assuming that
Massachusetts is the ringleader

00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:20.163
of all the trouble;
the real reason for the

00:18:20.163 --> 00:18:23.108
Congress is Massachusetts;
Massachusetts is the problem;

00:18:23.108 --> 00:18:26.528
Massachusetts is moving towards
rebellion;

00:18:26.528 --> 00:18:29.377
and to some people back in
England looking on,

00:18:29.377 --> 00:18:32.288
this Continental Congress looks
treasonable.

00:18:32.288 --> 00:18:36.328
So you can see how things are
evolving here.

00:18:36.328 --> 00:18:39.769
You can see how mutual
misunderstandings are growing.

00:18:39.769 --> 00:18:43.003
Colonists and the British
administration are grappling

00:18:43.003 --> 00:18:46.848
with the real meaning of British
sovereignty in the colonies.

00:18:46.848 --> 00:18:50.781
The British government isn't
really clear on some of the

00:18:50.781 --> 00:18:54.000
logic of colonial thinking on
such matters.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.897
Colonists see an ongoing
attempt to violate their

00:18:56.897 --> 00:19:00.401
fundamental rights as British
subjects as they have come to

00:19:00.401 --> 00:19:03.772
understand them,
which brings us to the perfect

00:19:03.772 --> 00:19:08.118
segue into a discussion of the
logic of colonial resistance,

00:19:08.118 --> 00:19:13.488
the logic driving the colonial
mindset during the passage of

00:19:13.488 --> 00:19:14.578
the 1770s.
 

00:19:14.578 --> 00:19:16.778
And what I'm going to do
now--I'm going to introduce this

00:19:16.778 --> 00:19:18.940
subject by doing something
that's a little bit illogical

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.588
but I just can't resist it
basically,

00:19:20.588 --> 00:19:22.598
so you are going to be subject
to it.

00:19:22.598 --> 00:19:25.731
There actually is a logic to
it, but to talk about the logic

00:19:25.731 --> 00:19:29.154
of resistance in the Revolution,
I'm going to use a story that

00:19:29.154 --> 00:19:31.799
actually dates to a period
significantly after the

00:19:31.799 --> 00:19:33.856
Revolution,
which kind of doesn't make

00:19:33.856 --> 00:19:36.784
sense but it does because the
story actually really wraps up a

00:19:36.784 --> 00:19:37.838
lot of stuff in it.
 

00:19:37.838 --> 00:19:41.789
And this story relates to a
conversation that took place in

00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:44.308
1791, so it's after the
Revolution.

00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:49.234
The United States has only been
in existence for a few years

00:19:49.234 --> 00:19:51.740
when this story takes place.
 

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.308
And Secretary of State Thomas
Jefferson,

00:19:55.308 --> 00:19:58.450
who is almost newly arrived as
Secretary of State,

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:01.182
not there for that long,
decides he's going to have a

00:20:01.182 --> 00:20:04.439
little dinner party to discuss a
political question that's come

00:20:04.439 --> 00:20:06.779
up,
and he invites Vice President

00:20:06.779 --> 00:20:10.092
John Adams and he invites
Secretary of the Treasury

00:20:10.092 --> 00:20:11.548
Alexander Hamilton.
 

00:20:11.548 --> 00:20:14.571
The reason why we know this
story is because Jefferson told

00:20:14.571 --> 00:20:15.509
it a lot, right?
 

00:20:15.509 --> 00:20:18.118
Because as we'll see,
Jefferson draws great,

00:20:18.118 --> 00:20:20.999
deep significance to this
little dinner conversation and

00:20:20.999 --> 00:20:23.669
he repeated it over and over
again in letters and in

00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:24.348
journals.
 

00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:26.737
It's like the story that
reveals the meaning of

00:20:26.737 --> 00:20:28.450
everything--but you'll see why.
 

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.914
It won't sound too dramatic now
that I've set it up that way,

00:20:30.914 --> 00:20:32.558
but to Jefferson it was
earth-shaking.

00:20:32.558 --> 00:20:35.220
So a little dinner party,
Adams, Jefferson,

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.068
Hamilton--and Jefferson,
who tells the story,

00:20:38.068 --> 00:20:40.779
says that after they're done
with their meal,

00:20:40.779 --> 00:20:43.298
quote, "our questions
agreed and dismissed,

00:20:43.298 --> 00:20:46.130
conversation began on other
matters....

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:49.681
The room, being hung around
with a collection of the

00:20:49.681 --> 00:20:53.103
portraits of remarkable men--
among them were those of Bacon,

00:20:53.103 --> 00:20:54.567
Newton,
and Locke--Hamilton asked me

00:20:54.567 --> 00:20:55.390
who they were."
 

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.348
So this is Jefferson's home and
in his home are these portraits,

00:20:58.348 --> 00:21:00.900
Bacon, Newton,
and Locke, and Hamilton,

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.588
sitting there as a dinner
guest, looks up,

00:21:02.588 --> 00:21:05.288
sees the portrait and says,
'Who are they?' Okay.

00:21:05.288 --> 00:21:07.596
Jefferson says,
"I told him they were my

00:21:07.596 --> 00:21:10.270
trinity of the three greatest
men the world had ever

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.904
produced"--
this is Professor Jefferson in

00:21:12.904 --> 00:21:14.950
full gear--
"naming them."

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.048
Lord Francis Bacon,
the philosopher of science,

00:21:18.048 --> 00:21:20.695
Sir Isaac Newton,
the scientist who defined the

00:21:20.695 --> 00:21:23.205
laws of gravity,
John Locke, the philosopher

00:21:23.205 --> 00:21:26.271
of--I suppose you could say,
the philosopher of liberty,

00:21:26.271 --> 00:21:28.538
and as Jefferson recalled
hearing this,

00:21:28.538 --> 00:21:31.160
quote, Hamilton "paused
for some time.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.694
'The greatest man,' said he,
'that ever lived was Julius

00:21:35.694 --> 00:21:37.509
Caesar.'"
Okay.

00:21:37.509 --> 00:21:40.308
Now for reasons that will
become clear in this lecture,

00:21:40.308 --> 00:21:44.970
this shocked Jefferson,
shocked Jefferson,

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.980
so that he told the story again
and again and again,

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.048
remembered it for decades.
 

00:21:49.048 --> 00:21:51.027
In the 1820s,
he's still like,

00:21:51.027 --> 00:21:54.867
'I remember that story,
the dinner with Hamilton 30

00:21:54.867 --> 00:21:57.779
years ago [laughs]
in which he said,

00:21:57.779 --> 00:21:59.829
'The greatest man who ever
lived was Julius Caesar.'

00:21:59.829 --> 00:22:02.019
He repeated it.
 

00:22:02.019 --> 00:22:05.903
To him it was a sign of the
amazing dangerous implications

00:22:05.903 --> 00:22:09.448
of Hamilton's policies,
but I want to pull this story

00:22:09.448 --> 00:22:10.130
apart.
 

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.834
I want to look at this a little
bit as a way not really of

00:22:12.834 --> 00:22:14.588
getting at Jefferson and
Hamilton,

00:22:14.588 --> 00:22:17.361
but to get at something of the
intellectual mindset of

00:22:17.361 --> 00:22:20.444
Americans during this period and
some of this has to do with

00:22:20.444 --> 00:22:23.394
Enlightenment thinking,
and some of this has to do with

00:22:23.394 --> 00:22:27.080
constitutional thinking,
but you'll see why both men

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.980
said what they said.
 

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.230
Now to start with,
I'm not saying that every

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:34.213
single colonist is sitting
around at this point discussing

00:22:34.213 --> 00:22:35.680
Bacon, Newton and Locke.
 

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.910
Okay. That's not what I mean.
 

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:39.939
This is very much a
Jeffersonian parlor with these

00:22:39.939 --> 00:22:44.136
portraits up on the wall,
but those three men--Bacon,

00:22:44.136 --> 00:22:46.166
Newton,
Locke--and others,

00:22:46.166 --> 00:22:49.656
did contribute to an
intellectual atmosphere that the

00:22:49.656 --> 00:22:53.817
American colonists tapped into
that shaped their thoughts about

00:22:53.817 --> 00:22:55.592
rights,
about resistance,

00:22:55.592 --> 00:22:57.608
and then eventually about
revolution.

00:22:57.608 --> 00:23:02.026
So let's start by looking at
Jefferson's trinity of great

00:23:02.026 --> 00:23:02.500
men.
 

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.048
Who were they?
 

00:23:05.048 --> 00:23:05.432
Okay.
 

00:23:05.432 --> 00:23:08.876
Sir Francis Bacon,
man of science who believed

00:23:08.876 --> 00:23:13.163
that truth discovered by reason
through observation could

00:23:13.163 --> 00:23:17.757
promote human happiness as well
as truth communicated through

00:23:17.757 --> 00:23:20.130
God's direct revelation.
 

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:24.066
So basically Bacon's work
suggested that it was in

00:23:24.066 --> 00:23:28.564
humankind's power to discover
truth by reason and that by

00:23:28.564 --> 00:23:31.839
doing that,
humankind could better itself.

00:23:31.839 --> 00:23:34.250
Okay. So that's Bacon.
 

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:37.214
Isaac Newton,
a second man of science who

00:23:37.214 --> 00:23:40.328
studied gravity and the laws of
motion,

00:23:40.328 --> 00:23:45.385
and Newton's work demonstrated
that it was possible through

00:23:45.385 --> 00:23:50.791
reason and study to discover the
laws of nature and of nature's

00:23:50.791 --> 00:23:51.490
God.
 

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:55.143
So Newton's work suggested that
the world is governed by laws

00:23:55.143 --> 00:23:57.640
that you could discover and
understand;

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.442
that there's a cause and
effect, and that through reason

00:24:00.442 --> 00:24:03.500
and study you can figure out the
cause and effect of nature's

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:03.960
laws.
 

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.798
So then on to the third man,
John Locke,

00:24:07.798 --> 00:24:12.480
whose Second Treatise on
Government from 1683

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:17.986
suggested that you could apply
nature's laws to the political

00:24:17.986 --> 00:24:22.108
world as well,
and determine and understand

00:24:22.108 --> 00:24:24.660
natural and political rights.
 

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.565
And I'm going to offer here a
really woefully brief summary of

00:24:27.565 --> 00:24:30.423
Locke's thoughts that'll just be
enough to give us a sense of

00:24:30.423 --> 00:24:32.710
what it is that Jefferson's
getting at here.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:38.118
Basically, Locke believed that
people were born free,

00:24:38.118 --> 00:24:42.538
unhampered by government and
with certain natural rights--

00:24:42.538 --> 00:24:45.616
life, liberty,
and property--and that to

00:24:45.616 --> 00:24:49.957
protect these rights people
decided to voluntarily leave

00:24:49.957 --> 00:24:54.140
this state of nature to form a
civil government,

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.295
contracting some of their
natural rights to this

00:24:57.295 --> 00:24:59.308
government when they did so.
 

00:24:59.308 --> 00:25:04.018
So civil society was created to
protect humankind's three

00:25:04.018 --> 00:25:07.548
natural rights--life,
liberty, property.

00:25:07.548 --> 00:25:10.758
So you could refer to this as
social contract theory,

00:25:10.758 --> 00:25:12.980
a logical enough summing up of
it.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:16.233
If you think about it,
if a civil government is a kind

00:25:16.233 --> 00:25:20.005
of voluntary contract,
this suggests that people have

00:25:20.005 --> 00:25:24.104
a right to pull out of that
contract if their rights are

00:25:24.104 --> 00:25:27.335
being violated,
and obviously that will have an

00:25:27.335 --> 00:25:29.150
important logic down the road.
 

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:31.500
Now if you take all of that
together--

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.086
Bacon, Newton,
Locke, and the logic of their

00:25:34.086 --> 00:25:36.980
thoughts--
you can see the empowering

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.568
aspect of Jefferson's trinity.
 

00:25:39.568 --> 00:25:39.950
Right?
 

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:43.875
All of those men in one way or
another are preaching ideas that

00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:45.650
are empowering humankind.
 

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:49.622
They're suggesting that there
are laws of the universe that

00:25:49.622 --> 00:25:53.390
could be determined by people
and applied to nature,

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:56.128
to government,
to science, to society in the

00:25:56.128 --> 00:25:57.848
hope of bettering things.
 

00:25:57.848 --> 00:26:02.067
They suggested that civil
government is a contract created

00:26:02.067 --> 00:26:05.988
by and maintained by people,
not some kind of a divine

00:26:05.988 --> 00:26:06.950
creation.
 

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:11.278
And if you step back and
consider the implications of

00:26:11.278 --> 00:26:15.910
these really broad ideas,
you can see that they share an

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:19.974
underlying conviction that
humankind could solve God's

00:26:19.974 --> 00:26:22.890
riddles by dissolving--
dissolving?

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:27.611
dissolving his laws,
chaos--discovering and applying

00:26:27.611 --> 00:26:29.368
his natural laws.
 

00:26:29.368 --> 00:26:33.730
And in a sense this is the idea
that's the spirit of the

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:36.601
Enlightenment--
that the world is governed by

00:26:36.601 --> 00:26:38.490
natural laws that can be
detected,

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:41.068
they can be studied,
they can be applied,

00:26:41.068 --> 00:26:45.480
and in a sense the practice of
deism stems from this idea.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:49.150
There were some Founder types
who were basically deists at

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.483
heart,
believing that God was a sort

00:26:51.483 --> 00:26:55.233
of divine clockmaker who made a
world of logic and natural laws

00:26:55.233 --> 00:26:58.500
and then stepped back and
allowed it to operate without

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.181
intervening,
and this kind of God was

00:27:01.181 --> 00:27:04.961
omniscient and all powerful but
it was natural forces that

00:27:04.961 --> 00:27:06.818
governed daily existence.
 

00:27:06.818 --> 00:27:10.837
And things that were governed
by understandable and

00:27:10.837 --> 00:27:15.017
predictable natural laws could
be detected, analyzed,

00:27:15.017 --> 00:27:17.670
critiqued and applied by man.
 

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:21.301
So in this sense you really can
see how some of the spirit of

00:27:21.301 --> 00:27:24.510
the Enlightenment would have
been a kind of empowering

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:25.420
philosophy.
 

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:28.679
So Jefferson's trinity of
portraits reveals a lot about

00:27:28.679 --> 00:27:31.817
this kind of general
Enlightenment spirit and some of

00:27:31.817 --> 00:27:36.634
its intellectual implications,
but what about the other half

00:27:36.634 --> 00:27:37.940
of the story?
 

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.446
What about Hamilton's comment
about Julius Caesar and

00:27:40.446 --> 00:27:43.002
Jefferson's I'm-going-to-be-
shocked-for-three-decades

00:27:43.002 --> 00:27:43.630
response?
 

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:48.299
Well, this aspect of the story
reveals another related aspect

00:27:48.299 --> 00:27:50.868
of the Enlightenment mentality.
 

00:27:50.868 --> 00:27:55.160
It shows how immediate and
relevant the ancient world--

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:59.230
and actually history
generally--was to Enlightenment

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:00.727
thinkers,
and I suppose,

00:28:00.727 --> 00:28:02.338
just in the eighteenth century
generally.

00:28:02.338 --> 00:28:05.967
An idea that's--again--related
to this idea that humankind can

00:28:05.967 --> 00:28:09.000
detect patterns and then apply
them for all time.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.730
Because basically,
if you think about it,

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.528
if you believe in ongoing
natural patterns,

00:28:13.528 --> 00:28:17.210
you're also going to believe
that the study of history,

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:20.969
all of history,
is one way to determine laws

00:28:20.969 --> 00:28:26.038
and patterns of human nature
that apply across all time.

00:28:26.038 --> 00:28:28.400
So basically to people at this
period,

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:32.521
all of history was like a big
grab bag of lessons about

00:28:32.521 --> 00:28:36.108
humankind and civil society:
ancient Greece,

00:28:36.108 --> 00:28:38.018
ancient Rome,
modern nations,

00:28:38.018 --> 00:28:39.788
modern peoples and more.
 

00:28:39.788 --> 00:28:42.208
If you study them,
if you look at rules and

00:28:42.208 --> 00:28:44.797
patterns,
you could find things to apply

00:28:44.797 --> 00:28:48.593
to modern times that ideally
would allow you to better things

00:28:48.593 --> 00:28:51.440
for the present by learning from
the past.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.683
And in a way the ultimate
example of this--I think I've

00:28:53.683 --> 00:28:55.140
mentioned it once before in
here;

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.705
I'm not sure--is James Madison
preparing for the Constitutional

00:28:58.705 --> 00:29:01.753
Convention and he's very
much--he's right in line with

00:29:01.753 --> 00:29:03.250
this kind of thinking.
 

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:06.435
He basically says,
'I'm going to study republics

00:29:06.435 --> 00:29:08.200
across all time,' right?
 

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.588
All of human time--I will study
republican government--

00:29:10.588 --> 00:29:12.678
and thinking,
if he could figure out the

00:29:12.678 --> 00:29:14.448
rules,
if he could figure out what

00:29:14.448 --> 00:29:17.261
works and what doesn't work and
see the patterns and get the

00:29:17.261 --> 00:29:18.950
rules,
he can then apply that

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:22.363
knowledge to the creation of a
new republic that hopefully then

00:29:22.363 --> 00:29:24.838
would benefit from that kind of
knowledge.

00:29:24.838 --> 00:29:27.400
I love the fact that Madison
sets out to do that,

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.000
writes it all down on paper.
 

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.830
So you can see how in this
sense--If you're thinking along

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:35.705
these lines,
you can see how ancient history

00:29:35.705 --> 00:29:39.017
could be really immediate to
this sort of whole founding

00:29:39.017 --> 00:29:41.884
generation,
because it had real lessons for

00:29:41.884 --> 00:29:42.710
the present.
 

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:46.339
And actually one of the most
influential books in educating

00:29:46.339 --> 00:29:49.720
young gentlemen at the time was
Plutarch's Lives.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.038
Has anyone here read
Plutarch?

00:29:52.038 --> 00:29:53.807
There must be some--Oh,
there's a couple of Plutarch

00:29:53.807 --> 00:29:54.480
readers in here.
 

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.930
That's admirable.
 

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:58.813
Plutarch's Lives is
basically a collection of brief

00:29:58.813 --> 00:30:01.140
biographies of great statesmen
and leaders,

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.795
ancient Greece,
ancient Rome,

00:30:02.795 --> 00:30:05.868
and it was aimed at teaching
rules of leadership,

00:30:05.868 --> 00:30:08.630
teaching young men how to model
themselves into great leaders,

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:11.460
or certainly that's how it was
used in the eighteenth century.

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.763
Any young man would have read
Plutarch's Lives and

00:30:13.763 --> 00:30:16.048
would have learned--
the greatest thing I can do is

00:30:16.048 --> 00:30:18.118
to be a great statesman and
found a nation,

00:30:18.118 --> 00:30:21.269
and here are great examples for
me to follow.

00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:24.742
So given this kind of a logic,
there's a good reason why

00:30:24.742 --> 00:30:28.404
Hamilton's comment about Caesar
might have been shocking to

00:30:28.404 --> 00:30:29.288
Jefferson.
 

00:30:29.288 --> 00:30:31.769
It's not just a little
interesting intellectual sort of

00:30:31.769 --> 00:30:33.516
"ha"
on the part of Hamilton:

00:30:33.516 --> 00:30:35.050
'oh,
I think the greatest man that

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:37.670
ever lived was Julius Caesar,
pass the cherries.'

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:40.602
It's not--He didn't see this as
a sort of random idle throwaway

00:30:40.602 --> 00:30:41.690
intellectual comment.
 

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:44.905
It was a declaration about
present day policies to

00:30:44.905 --> 00:30:47.300
Jefferson,
and it wasn't a declaration

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.040
that made Jefferson happy
because think about the

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.694
historical lesson that Jefferson
logically pulled from Hamilton's

00:30:53.694 --> 00:30:55.579
comment about Julius Caesar.
 

00:30:55.579 --> 00:30:57.180
Who was Julius Caesar?
 

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:01.259
In short, he was the man who
destroyed the Roman republic.

00:31:01.259 --> 00:31:01.547
Okay.
 

00:31:01.547 --> 00:31:04.647
He's the guy who marched his
army against the republic,

00:31:04.647 --> 00:31:07.288
who seized power,
who made himself emperor.

00:31:07.288 --> 00:31:11.248
So there we are in 1791 and
Alexander Hamilton in the middle

00:31:11.248 --> 00:31:15.205
of this experiment to create a
new republic--no one knows if

00:31:15.205 --> 00:31:17.898
it's going to work;
it might collapse at any

00:31:17.898 --> 00:31:19.720
second--and Alexander Hamilton
says,

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.432
'The greatest man who ever
lived is Julius Caesar,' the man

00:31:22.432 --> 00:31:24.068
who destroyed the Roman
republic.

00:31:24.068 --> 00:31:24.480
Okay.
 

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:28.088
This is why Jefferson was like
[laughs]: 'oh,

00:31:28.088 --> 00:31:28.910
my God.
 

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:30.029
What does this mean?'
 

00:31:30.029 --> 00:31:30.960
What does this mean?
 

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.348
This is the truth to Hamilton.
 

00:31:32.348 --> 00:31:32.622
Right?
 

00:31:32.622 --> 00:31:35.388
This is a bad moment as far as
relations between Jefferson and

00:31:35.388 --> 00:31:37.839
Hamilton are concerned,
the Jefferson dinner party.

00:31:37.839 --> 00:31:39.848
Hamilton never lived it down.
 

00:31:39.848 --> 00:31:43.348
So to Jefferson this is--to him
this was like he--the scales

00:31:43.348 --> 00:31:45.009
were lifted from his eyes.
 

00:31:45.009 --> 00:31:45.282
Right?
 

00:31:45.282 --> 00:31:47.059
Hamilton wants to be a kind of
Caesar.

00:31:47.059 --> 00:31:48.318
He's dangerously ambitious.
 

00:31:48.318 --> 00:31:50.460
He wants to destroy the
republic.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.064
Maybe he wants to make it back
into a monarchy and then put

00:31:53.064 --> 00:31:55.220
himself into some kind of a
position of power.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.731
He could just see the pathway
laid, all with that one little

00:31:58.731 --> 00:32:01.528
comment that Hamilton tossed out
at a dinner.

00:32:01.528 --> 00:32:03.877
You had to be careful how you
talked [laughs]

00:32:03.877 --> 00:32:06.118
in an age where history meant
that much.

00:32:06.118 --> 00:32:08.561
Now let's stop for a moment
also to think:

00:32:08.561 --> 00:32:10.230
why did Hamilton say that?
 

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.798
Why did he say that?
 

00:32:11.798 --> 00:32:15.845
It's unlikely that what he
meant to say was,

00:32:15.845 --> 00:32:16.410
'Hi.
 

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:17.940
I'm going to be the next Julius
Caesar.

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.747
[laughs]
I'm out to destroy the

00:32:19.747 --> 00:32:20.410
republic.
 

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:21.578
Nice to meet you.'
 

00:32:21.578 --> 00:32:21.876
Okay.
 

00:32:21.876 --> 00:32:25.442
He probably wasn't intending to
signal some big threat to the

00:32:25.442 --> 00:32:26.690
American republic.
 

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:30.660
I think that there are probably
two explanations for it.

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:33.644
No one actually ever absolutely
knows why he said this and that

00:32:33.644 --> 00:32:35.858
says more about Hamilton than
anything else.

00:32:35.858 --> 00:32:37.765
He's a wonderfully
self-destructive individual,

00:32:37.765 --> 00:32:39.794
Alexander Hamilton,
but in this case I think there

00:32:39.794 --> 00:32:41.700
are two possible reasons why he
said this.

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.989
One is he actually just liked
to say things to upset Thomas

00:32:44.989 --> 00:32:45.670
Jefferson.
 

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:48.116
[laughter]
He really did and this was a

00:32:48.116 --> 00:32:49.368
good one,
[laughs]

00:32:49.368 --> 00:32:51.950
better than he thought,
but he liked to push

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:54.519
Jefferson's buttons,
get Jefferson all sort of

00:32:54.519 --> 00:32:56.618
sputtering and mad,
and it worked.

00:32:56.618 --> 00:32:58.950
Aaron Burr did the same thing
to Alexander Hamilton.

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:01.681
He would say sort of shocking,
outrageous things and then

00:33:01.681 --> 00:33:04.267
watch Hamilton sputter,
and then Hamilton would repeat

00:33:04.267 --> 00:33:06.170
them for years and years and
years.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:08.400
'Do you know what he said at
the dinner party?'

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.392
Dinner parties were tricky
places to maneuver in the early

00:33:11.392 --> 00:33:11.970
republic.
 

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:15.776
So part of it might have been
just Hamilton being deliberately

00:33:15.776 --> 00:33:17.983
irritating,
or equally possible,

00:33:17.983 --> 00:33:21.654
it's possible that Hamilton was
referring to Caesar as a

00:33:21.654 --> 00:33:24.380
statesman,
a leader, a founder of a nation.

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.519
Hamilton would have admired
military ability,

00:33:27.519 --> 00:33:30.699
so he would have actually
seriously admired that in Caesar

00:33:30.699 --> 00:33:32.442
too,
but he really could have been

00:33:32.442 --> 00:33:34.538
more thinking of Caesar as great
statesman,

00:33:34.538 --> 00:33:38.003
great leader,
depicted in Plutarch as

00:33:38.003 --> 00:33:38.808
a model.
 

00:33:38.808 --> 00:33:41.230
And certainly in the mind of an
educated gentleman like

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:43.290
Hamilton,
being the founder of a nation,

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:45.269
being someone who's shaping a
nation,

00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:46.828
would have been seen as an
admirable thing,

00:33:46.828 --> 00:33:48.358
so he could have been thinking
along those lines.

00:33:48.358 --> 00:33:51.044
It's interesting when you look
through all of Hamilton's

00:33:51.044 --> 00:33:52.770
writings--
he doesn't really speak in

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:55.941
praise of Caesar anywhere else,
which might lead you to theory

00:33:55.941 --> 00:33:56.630
number one.
 

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:58.384
[laughter]
'Okay, T.J.,

00:33:58.384 --> 00:34:01.019
see how you deal with this one.
 

00:34:01.019 --> 00:34:03.788
[laughs]
I'm all for Julius Caesar.

00:34:03.788 --> 00:34:06.298
[laughs]
What are you going to do?'

00:34:06.298 --> 00:34:06.490
No.
 

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:09.414
It's hard to know,
but at any rate it's unclear

00:34:09.414 --> 00:34:12.309
what Hamilton's logic is,
but you can certainly

00:34:12.309 --> 00:34:14.409
understand Jefferson's shocked
response,

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:16.947
and either way,
both the comment and the

00:34:16.947 --> 00:34:21.112
response reveal the power of the
classical heritage on this early

00:34:21.112 --> 00:34:22.349
American world.
 

00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:26.559
Both men are applying the past
to the present in some way.

00:34:26.559 --> 00:34:29.860
And one of the lessons that
Caesar certainly suggested to

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:33.277
Thomas Jefferson as suggested by
his response is a powerful

00:34:33.277 --> 00:34:37.048
lesson that a lot of people were
focused on in the early years of

00:34:37.048 --> 00:34:40.880
the American republic and in
this colonial period as well,

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.840
and that is the fragility of
liberties--

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:47.059
and in the republic also
obviously how fragile republics

00:34:47.059 --> 00:34:47.518
are.
 

00:34:47.518 --> 00:34:51.226
So the ancient world held
really valuable lessons but so

00:34:51.226 --> 00:34:54.798
did the semi-recent past as
well, particularly for the

00:34:54.798 --> 00:34:56.349
American colonists.
 

00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:59.724
There was another period of
time that seemed to hold special

00:34:59.724 --> 00:35:02.237
lessons for them,
the period of the Glorious

00:35:02.237 --> 00:35:05.215
Revolution in Britain,
which would have been a period

00:35:05.215 --> 00:35:08.588
when opposition to the King's
Court and ministers was on the

00:35:08.588 --> 00:35:11.960
rise in Britain along with a
growing tradition of praise for

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.989
English liberties and the
glories of representation in

00:35:14.989 --> 00:35:16.018
Parliament.
 

00:35:16.018 --> 00:35:19.362
So political rhetoric from the
era of the Glorious Revolution

00:35:19.362 --> 00:35:22.313
would have focused on attacking
corruption and corrupt

00:35:22.313 --> 00:35:24.788
influence,
as when a monarch would try to

00:35:24.788 --> 00:35:27.954
bribe legislators or ministers
with high office or pensions

00:35:27.954 --> 00:35:31.461
granted from the Crown,
thereby subverting the balanced

00:35:31.461 --> 00:35:33.807
British constitution,
which is supposed to be

00:35:33.807 --> 00:35:36.699
balanced between Crown,
Lords and Commons.

00:35:36.699 --> 00:35:40.235
That would have had some real
bearing on this revolutionary

00:35:40.235 --> 00:35:43.769
period as well But whether
talking about history ancient or

00:35:43.769 --> 00:35:47.072
history relatively modern,
history did teach some

00:35:47.072 --> 00:35:50.862
overriding lessons that British
subjects would have taken as

00:35:50.862 --> 00:35:54.907
their own throughout this period
and that at this moment in time

00:35:54.907 --> 00:35:58.570
would seem really relevant in
the American colonies.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:02.443
So--there is going to be an
amazingly brief summary of some

00:36:02.443 --> 00:36:05.219
of these lessons,
but you'll see really clear

00:36:05.219 --> 00:36:08.257
lessons that history would
appear to be teaching generally

00:36:08.257 --> 00:36:11.829
and that the colonists would be
listening to really attentively.

00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:15.282
So history taught basically
that arbitrary power is the

00:36:15.282 --> 00:36:17.650
ultimate threat to good
government.

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:17.911
Okay.
 

00:36:17.911 --> 00:36:20.898
So the 1770s is a moment when
that's certainly going to be

00:36:20.898 --> 00:36:22.469
something that people hear.
 

00:36:22.469 --> 00:36:26.010
History taught that political
liberties were fragile.

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:30.242
History taught that
constitutional principles

00:36:30.242 --> 00:36:35.728
defended customary contractarian
rights against government

00:36:35.728 --> 00:36:39.000
assertions of arbitrary power.
 

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.981
So arbitrary power is the
ultimate threat to good

00:36:40.981 --> 00:36:43.440
government;
political liberties are fragile;

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:47.621
and it's constitutional
principles that defend against

00:36:47.621 --> 00:36:50.699
government asserting arbitrary
power.

00:36:50.699 --> 00:36:54.085
So yes, Rome had been great,
but arbitrary power had sent it

00:36:54.085 --> 00:36:55.518
spiraling into tyranny.
 

00:36:55.518 --> 00:36:58.806
The Glorious Revolution had
been a moment where ancient

00:36:58.806 --> 00:37:02.338
liberties had been restored by
restraining the power of the

00:37:02.338 --> 00:37:03.070
monarch.
 

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:06.320
So clearly history taught
liberty is fragile,

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.190
and power is the natural
enemy--arbitrary power--

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:14.550
and power naturally grows,
by nature power grows,

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:18.179
and as it does it encroaches on
liberties in a free society.

00:37:18.179 --> 00:37:22.804
So power has to be restrained;
British liberties must be

00:37:22.804 --> 00:37:25.643
defended;
and British liberties,

00:37:25.643 --> 00:37:31.409
as defined by generations of
constitutional precedents.

00:37:31.409 --> 00:37:35.474
Now it's important to remember
that the British constitution is

00:37:35.474 --> 00:37:38.949
not a written document like
American state and federal

00:37:38.949 --> 00:37:40.130
constitutions.
 

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:43.297
It's a way of thinking about
authority largely based on

00:37:43.297 --> 00:37:46.130
precedent,
based on existing institutions,

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:50.264
based on laws and customs,
and it was a means of limiting

00:37:50.264 --> 00:37:52.380
power and defending rights.
 

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:56.143
So when British colonial policy
began to change in the

00:37:56.143 --> 00:37:59.621
mid-eighteenth century and
precedents seemed to be

00:37:59.621 --> 00:38:03.670
abandoned and new precedents
perhaps were being set,

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:07.365
when Parliament seemed to be
asserting what certainly to some

00:38:07.365 --> 00:38:09.768
colonists felt like arbitrary
power,

00:38:09.768 --> 00:38:13.347
colonists logically began to
worry about protecting their

00:38:13.347 --> 00:38:17.117
fundamental British liberties
against seemingly increasingly

00:38:17.117 --> 00:38:19.289
arbitrary parliamentary power.
 

00:38:19.289 --> 00:38:20.579
They felt defensive.
 

00:38:20.579 --> 00:38:25.081
They worried about the seeming
inevitability of a rise of

00:38:25.081 --> 00:38:26.530
arbitrary power.
 

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:30.369
Now of course people in
Parliament did not see

00:38:30.369 --> 00:38:34.039
themselves as exercising
arbitrary power.

00:38:34.039 --> 00:38:35.389
They saw themselves as behaving
constitutionally,

00:38:35.389 --> 00:38:37.835
asserting their constitutional
power to govern over the

00:38:37.835 --> 00:38:40.617
colonies,
but as we've seen in this

00:38:40.617 --> 00:38:43.371
course so far,
there were some fundamental

00:38:43.371 --> 00:38:46.065
disagreements on both sides
about the precise meaning of

00:38:46.065 --> 00:38:48.565
Parliament's constitutional
power to govern over the

00:38:48.565 --> 00:38:51.005
colonies,
about the precise way in which

00:38:51.005 --> 00:38:53.449
this imperial system was
supposed to work.

00:38:53.449 --> 00:38:57.585
So acts like the Stamp Act,
which Parliament basically

00:38:57.585 --> 00:39:00.550
intended as a way to raise
revenue,

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:03.806
or the Tea Act,
same idea, could logically seem

00:39:03.806 --> 00:39:08.268
to the colonists like a way of
establishing a new precedent,

00:39:08.268 --> 00:39:12.594
right?--a new precedent that
ultimately would be making some

00:39:12.594 --> 00:39:16.480
kind of inroad against liberty
and property rights.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.277
And particularly,
given that the Stamp Act was

00:39:19.277 --> 00:39:23.380
not ultimately raising enormous
sums of money to the colonists,

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.268
that was a real sign that it
must be about a precedent.

00:39:26.268 --> 00:39:26.557
Right?
 

00:39:26.557 --> 00:39:29.300
It can't really be about
raising enormous sums of money.

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:32.690
It must be a trap,
a precedent-setting trap,

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:35.771
that if they can get us to
accept this precedent then the

00:39:35.771 --> 00:39:39.182
government will be able to set
future taxes along similar lines

00:39:39.182 --> 00:39:41.659
because the precedent will have
been set.

00:39:41.659 --> 00:39:44.224
If your constitution--If you
understand your constitutional

00:39:44.224 --> 00:39:47.262
rights as based on precedent,
when you see new precedents

00:39:47.262 --> 00:39:50.690
potentially being set that's a
potentially scary thing,

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:53.576
so you can kind of get a sense
of why the colonists are

00:39:53.576 --> 00:39:56.570
reacting as they do to a lot of
events in this period.

00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:59.523
As John Dickinson wrote
in--I've mentioned before his

00:39:59.523 --> 00:40:02.931
really well-known pamphlet from
1768 called Letters from a

00:40:02.931 --> 00:40:05.931
Farmer in Pennsylvania.
Dickinson wrote,

00:40:05.931 --> 00:40:08.889
"Nothing is wanted at
home"--

00:40:08.889 --> 00:40:12.400
and by home he means
Britain--"but a precedent,

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.914
the force of which shall be
established by the tacit

00:40:15.914 --> 00:40:18.119
submission of the colonies....
 

00:40:18.119 --> 00:40:20.880
If the parliament succeeds in
this attempt,

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.639
other statutes will impose
other duties.

00:40:23.639 --> 00:40:26.692
And thus the parliament will
levy upon us such sums of money

00:40:26.692 --> 00:40:29.891
as they chuoose to take,
without any other limitation,

00:40:29.891 --> 00:40:31.570
than their pleasure."
 

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:31.858
Right?
 

00:40:31.858 --> 00:40:33.730
He says it's just about the
precedent;

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:34.940
it's all about precedent.
 

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:37.210
That's what we're looking at
here.

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:40.003
The fact that small amounts of
money are being raised in a

00:40:40.003 --> 00:40:42.650
sense is the ultimate proof that
what really matters to

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:45.250
Parliament is the precedent that
they're setting.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:48.117
The same holds true for the
Vice-Admiralty courts I've

00:40:48.117 --> 00:40:50.960
mentioned before,
that were being used as venues

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:54.070
for trying certain crimes
committed in the colonies.

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:56.730
Vice-Admiralty courts were
composed of a single judge,

00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:59.000
they had no jury,
and they were becoming

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.144
responsible for enforcing
parliamentary legislation and

00:41:02.144 --> 00:41:03.309
new legislation.
 

00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:08.050
Logically, many colonists would
have seen this--

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:11.226
again--really dangerous
precedent violating fundamental

00:41:11.226 --> 00:41:15.190
British constitutional rights,
violating past precedents.

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:19.231
The presence of a standing army
in the colonies:

00:41:19.231 --> 00:41:21.400
also,
same kind of threat,

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.724
same kind of fear,
something new is happening

00:41:24.724 --> 00:41:28.838
here, and certainly history
ancient and modern taught about

00:41:28.838 --> 00:41:31.250
the dangers of a standing army.
 

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:35.077
And Samuel Adams summed up
prevailing ideas about standing

00:41:35.077 --> 00:41:39.510
armies in a newspaper essay that
he wrote in 1768 and he wrote,

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:41.630
"It is a very improbable
supposition,

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:44.699
that any people can long remain
free,

00:41:44.699 --> 00:41:48.144
with a strong military power in
the very heart of their country:

00:41:48.144 --> 00:41:51.152
Unless that military power is
under the direction of the

00:41:51.152 --> 00:41:53.342
people,
and even then it is

00:41:53.342 --> 00:41:56.851
dangerous.-- History,
both ancient and modern,

00:41:56.851 --> 00:42:01.052
affords many instances of the
overthrow of states and kingdoms

00:42:01.052 --> 00:42:04.692
by the power of soldiers,
who were rais'd and maintain'd

00:42:04.692 --> 00:42:07.976
at first under the plausible
pretense of defending those very

00:42:07.976 --> 00:42:10.768
liberties which they afterwards
destroyed."

00:42:10.768 --> 00:42:13.920
So in the colonies the fear of
a standing army was bad enough

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.967
at the end of the French and
Indian War when the crown sent

00:42:16.967 --> 00:42:19.909
troops to protect the colonists
against the French,

00:42:19.909 --> 00:42:22.820
the Spanish and the Native
American populations--

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:26.190
but a few years later when
troops began to arrive in Boston

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:28.690
in response to Stamp Act
demonstrations,

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:31.938
it certainly seemed to many
colonists as though it might be

00:42:31.938 --> 00:42:35.018
the first step in what could be
the destruction of their

00:42:35.018 --> 00:42:37.077
liberties,
their colonial charters,

00:42:37.077 --> 00:42:38.550
their constitutional rights.
 

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:41.550
This seemed to be--again--a
scary precedent.

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:44.159
Now in a way it's really
tempting to look at this way of

00:42:44.159 --> 00:42:46.246
thinking like,
these people are worried about

00:42:46.246 --> 00:42:47.860
precedents--'What's happening?
 

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:48.550
What does it mean?
 

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:51.722
It must be a sign that they're
going to do worse'--and think of

00:42:51.722 --> 00:42:54.588
these people as being really
paranoid and illogical like,

00:42:54.588 --> 00:42:55.460
'oh, come on.
 

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:57.554
[laughs]
What if it's just a little

00:42:57.554 --> 00:43:00.079
gesture to raise some money,
colonists?

00:43:00.079 --> 00:43:02.130
Why do you seem so paranoid?'
 

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:04.760
And there--In the past there
actually have been some

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.597
historians who suggested that
the colonists were to some

00:43:07.597 --> 00:43:10.527
degree being paranoid,
were seeing threats of tyranny

00:43:10.527 --> 00:43:12.989
where there actually wasn't any
tyranny at all.

00:43:12.989 --> 00:43:16.954
But as I've just described,
precedents are a fundamental

00:43:16.954 --> 00:43:19.909
part of British constitutional
thought.

00:43:19.909 --> 00:43:22.349
And Enlightenment theory backed
up that idea,

00:43:22.349 --> 00:43:25.289
because Enlightenment science
promised the capacity to

00:43:25.289 --> 00:43:27.840
understand and control nature
and society.

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.427
You're supposed to be looking
for patterns of behavior to

00:43:31.427 --> 00:43:33.349
understand what things mean.
 

00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:36.067
So the British government
seemed to be setting new

00:43:36.067 --> 00:43:39.449
precedents and the colonists
were looking for the pattern,

00:43:39.449 --> 00:43:42.420
trying to figure out the logic
of what was happening.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:43.769
What was Parliament up to?
 

00:43:43.769 --> 00:43:45.500
What were they thinking?
 

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.307
Why were they seemingly
violating fundamental

00:43:48.307 --> 00:43:49.840
constitutional rights?
 

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:53.940
And you can see this logic
again in Dickinson's pamphlet,

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:55.460
in his Letters from a Farmer
in Pennsylvania,

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.090
which he argued was
premised on his desire,

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:01.208
quote, "to discover the
intentions of those who rule

00:44:01.208 --> 00:44:02.099
over us."
 

00:44:02.099 --> 00:44:03.800
Why are they doing what they're
doing?

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:04.670
There's a pattern.
 

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:05.309
What is the pattern?
 

00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:07.110
What does it mean?
 

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:10.489
Colonists ultimately resisted
what they saw as the approach of

00:44:10.489 --> 00:44:13.112
tyranny,
and their resistance stiffened

00:44:13.112 --> 00:44:15.460
the British government's
resolve,

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:18.599
which in turn provoked more of
a reaction in the colonies.

00:44:18.599 --> 00:44:21.775
And eventually down the road,
the colonists would come to see

00:44:21.775 --> 00:44:24.949
their social contract with the
British government broken,

00:44:24.949 --> 00:44:28.795
a conclusion which would seem
to then give them the right of

00:44:28.795 --> 00:44:31.916
community resistance,
but as I've said before it's

00:44:31.916 --> 00:44:35.143
important to recognize that the
colonists at this point see

00:44:35.143 --> 00:44:37.701
their actions not as
revolutionary but just the

00:44:37.701 --> 00:44:38.480
opposite.
 

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.929
They're fighting for their
British rights.

00:44:40.929 --> 00:44:43.579
They're not trying to figure
out how to stage a revolution.

00:44:43.579 --> 00:44:45.110
I think when we hear the phrase
"Continental

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:46.260
Congress,"
we're like: 'ooh,

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.280
one more Continental Congress
and we're there,

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.518
[laughs]
wow, almost at independence,'--

00:44:50.518 --> 00:44:52.945
but that's obviously not the
way that they're thinking at the

00:44:52.945 --> 00:44:53.230
time.
 

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:56.195
They see themselves as fighting
against arbitrary power in

00:44:56.195 --> 00:44:59.985
defense of British liberties,
not as rabid revolutionaries,

00:44:59.985 --> 00:45:03.862
and thus far in the course,
it's Parliament that seems to

00:45:03.862 --> 00:45:07.250
be the main source of arbitrary
power to the colonists.

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:09.280
So as we're going to see in
future lectures,

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:12.329
a logical response to this
conclusion would be for the

00:45:12.329 --> 00:45:15.840
colonists to next turn to the
King to solve their problems.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:16.130
Okay.
 

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:19.561
If Parliament is exercising
arbitrary power we will now turn

00:45:19.561 --> 00:45:22.760
to the King and appeal to him to
solve our problems.

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:26.885
You--We will see that logic go
into effect very soon in future

00:45:26.885 --> 00:45:27.630
lectures.
 

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:31.072
So more has to happen before
the colonists begin to consider

00:45:31.072 --> 00:45:33.000
the ultimate act of resistance.
 

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.768
Actual rebellion would seem to
them as the last resort,

00:45:36.768 --> 00:45:40.050
the last resort of a people
unable to protect their lives,

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:44.768
liberties and properties by
normal constitutional methods,

00:45:44.768 --> 00:45:48.010
and there were some Members of
Parliament that could foresee

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:49.219
this looming threat.
 

00:45:49.219 --> 00:45:51.632
In early 1775,
Edmund Burke gave one of his

00:45:51.632 --> 00:45:53.699
best known speeches in
Parliament.

00:45:53.699 --> 00:45:56.918
It was a three-hour speech and
he argued in his speech that

00:45:56.918 --> 00:45:59.746
Parliament should try to be
conciliatory towards the

00:45:59.746 --> 00:46:02.300
colonies or risk pushing them to
extremes.

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:05.289
And he laid out in this speech
some of the points that actually

00:46:05.289 --> 00:46:07.699
have come up just in the course
of this lecture.

00:46:07.699 --> 00:46:10.389
He said Americans loved their
liberties.

00:46:10.389 --> 00:46:10.699
Why?
 

00:46:10.699 --> 00:46:15.650
Because they're descendants of
liberty-loving English citizens.

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:18.630
To those who argued that giving
concessions to the colonists

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:21.460
would encourage them to demand
even more concessions,

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:23.010
Burke said, he doubted whether,
quote,

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:23.791
"giving...
 

00:46:23.791 --> 00:46:26.605
two millions of my fellow
citizens, some share of those

00:46:26.605 --> 00:46:29.420
rights, which I have always been
taught to value,"

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:31.139
would bring down the empire.
 

00:46:31.139 --> 00:46:32.579
And he had a dramatic
conclusion.

00:46:32.579 --> 00:46:35.402
He said, "Let the colonies
always keep the idea of their

00:46:35.402 --> 00:46:37.710
civil rights associated with
your government;--

00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:40.300
they will cling and grapple to
you;

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.518
and no force under heaven will
be of power to tear them from

00:46:43.518 --> 00:46:46.518
their allegiance But let it once
be understood that your

00:46:46.518 --> 00:46:50.329
government may be one thing,
and their privilege another;

00:46:50.329 --> 00:46:53.489
that these two things may exist
without any mutual relation;

00:46:53.489 --> 00:46:56.889
the cement is gone;
the cohesion is loosened;

00:46:56.889 --> 00:47:00.699
and everything hastens to decay
and dissolution."

00:47:00.699 --> 00:47:02.969
So to the colonists then in a
sense--

00:47:02.969 --> 00:47:05.568
you can hear,
to Burke as well--rebellion

00:47:05.568 --> 00:47:08.880
would be a drastic action only
to be exercised by an

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.713
overwhelming majority of the
community against rulers who so

00:47:12.713 --> 00:47:16.742
completely ignored the terms of
the original social contract as

00:47:16.742 --> 00:47:21.030
to make further allegiance a
crime against God and reason.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:24.550
And it's really only by
grasping this mindset and really

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:28.389
taking it seriously that we can
begin to understand events to

00:47:28.389 --> 00:47:32.230
come that ultimately will lead
to what is seen at the time as

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:35.110
that last dire step towards
revolution.

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:36.469
I will stop there.
 

00:47:36.469 --> 00:47:38.980
I will see you on Tuesday.
 

00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:44.250
Happy paper-completing and have
a good weekend.

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:49.000

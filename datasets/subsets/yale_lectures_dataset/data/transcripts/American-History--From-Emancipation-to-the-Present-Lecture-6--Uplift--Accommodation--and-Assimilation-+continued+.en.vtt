00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:09.700
On Monday we talked about
uplift and its various ways

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.400
one can interpret
uplift--and I know you had a

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.167
lot of that information in
the Tera Hunter reading,

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:18.800
but it's really one of these
sort of foundational issues

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.300
for this class I wanted to
sort of labor over for a

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.300
while.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.600
Another foundational issue
is one of those keywords

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.167
talking about, I
talked about on Monday,

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:29.600
which is race management.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.400
Essentially, that's
what this lecture today is

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.600
about.&nbsp; This is a
lecture looking at Booker T.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.667
Washington, W.

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:37.667
E.

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:38.667
B.

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:39.800
Du Bois and the politics
of accommodation and

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.967
assimilation.&nbsp; It is a
debate that has manifested

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:48.800
itself in many
different forms,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.867
in different voices
throughout so much of the

00:00:51.867 --> 00:00:53.400
post-emancipation
African American experience,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.900
and it's a debate
that's still with us today,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.600
in ways that I'm pretty sure
will be coming back into

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.300
play on and off during the
rest of this term.&nbsp; So the

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.200
historian in me always wants
to contextualize.&nbsp; I want

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.467
you--and I'm not
crazy about dates,

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:16.667
but I want to give you a
timeline.&nbsp; It's important

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:19.100
for you to actually put
down in your notes.&nbsp; I'm not

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.800
putting up on the screen
cause it would be a one

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.867
slide show.&nbsp; It
wouldn't make any sense,

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:26.667
but understand this
timeline.&nbsp; Generally

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:29.300
speaking, at the
post-emancipation moment,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.000
1866 forward, you have the
appearance of a range of Jim

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.367
Crow laws
separating the races.

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:40.100
I can't tell you a
specific start date,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.367
because they vary by state.&nbsp;
But it's important to know

00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:45.300
that they start
with miscegenation,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.300
this fear over
black and white sex,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.800
black male and white female
specifically.&nbsp; So there are

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.800
laws against miscegenation,
at first.&nbsp; Then there are

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.300
laws in some states about
separating the races as far

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.400
as education.&nbsp; "Now we're
going to actually have to

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.167
educate these black folks,
we can't educate them in the

00:02:07.167 --> 00:02:11.000
same space."&nbsp; And then
within about a decade,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.300
now we're talking mid-1870s,
the laws start appearing on

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.200
separating the races
in areas of public

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.667
accommodation,
transportation.&nbsp; And that's

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:23.367
really where most people
point to the start of most

00:02:23.367 --> 00:02:26.500
Jim Crow laws, is around the
mid-1870s.&nbsp; That's the first

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.500
point in the timeline, the
mid-1870s.&nbsp; You already know

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.100
about Reconstruction,
the rise of Redemption,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.900
of course.&nbsp; 1895 I pointed
to in the last lecture as

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.800
being a rather important
year.&nbsp; You have in 1895 the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.267
National Baptist
Convention formed,

00:02:45.267 --> 00:02:49.667
as I talked about on
Monday.&nbsp; You have in that

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:53.100
same year the great
leader of the race,

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.967
Frederick Douglass, dies.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A major political figure in

00:02:56.967 --> 00:03:03.767
black and white America.&nbsp;
You have also in 1895 Booker

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:04.767
T.

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:06.867
Washington, the subject
of half of this lecture,

00:03:06.867 --> 00:03:09.667
giving his famous Atlanta
Cotton Exposition Address.&nbsp;

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.100
So the National Baptist
Convention is formed,

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.700
Frederick
Douglass dies, Booker T.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.267
Washington rises
in prominence,

00:03:18.267 --> 00:03:21.800
all in the same year.&nbsp; 1896,
the National Association of

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.100
Colored Women is formed, a
group I canvassed in the

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.200
latter part of yes--of
Monday's lecture.&nbsp; The same

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.600
year, the Supreme Court
offers its decision in

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.600
Plessey v.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.000
Ferguson.&nbsp; More on that in
today's lecture.&nbsp; In 1897,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.667
the American Negro Academy
is formed and in 1898,

00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:47.100
Alexander Crummell,
with whom I began Monday's

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.100
lecture, dies.&nbsp; So in
this three year window,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.700
you have the
assertion of religious,

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.000
organizational, and secular
independence with the

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.400
National Baptist Convention,
the death of an icon,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.600
Frederick Douglass, the rise
of another icon in Booker T.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.567
Washington, the formation
of a women's political

00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:11.067
organizing association
and social organization,

00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:15.867
a very important
Supreme Court decision,

00:04:15.867 --> 00:04:19.500
the founding of one of these
elitist attempts to solve

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.600
race problems, to
uplift the race,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.967
and in 1898, the death
of one of those icons,

00:04:24.967 --> 00:04:27.067
representing the leaders
in the Talented Tenth.&nbsp;

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.200
Undergirding all of that
are these Jim Crow laws.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.500
&nbsp;So that's the context,
chronological context for

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.100
today's lecture.&nbsp; Let me
begin playing an excerpt.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.867
It's scratchy, I know.

00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:46.800
I'm just going
to play about,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.800
I think about
forty-five seconds of it,

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.500
but it's also
kind of remarkable.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.500
Booker T.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.300
Washington: A ship lost at
sea for many days suddenly

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.967
sighted a friendly vessel.

00:04:58.967 --> 00:05:02.600
From the mast of the
unfortunate vessel was seen

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.800
a signal, "Water,
water; we die of thirst!"

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.867
The answer from the friendly
vessel at once came back,

00:05:09.867 --> 00:05:12.700
"Cast down your
bucket where you are."

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.100
A second time the
signal, "Water,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.300
send us water!"

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.300
ran from the
distressed vessel,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.367
and was answered, "Cast down
your bucket where you are."

00:05:22.367 --> 00:05:26.000
And a third and fourth
signal for water was

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.200
answered, "Cast down
your bucket where you are."

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.667
The captain of the
distressed vessel,

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:33.700
at last heeding
the injunction,

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.100
cast down his bucket, and
it came up full of fresh,

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.767
sparkling water from the
mouth of the Amazon River.

00:05:41.767 --> 00:05:45.800
To those of my race who
depend on bettering their

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.400
condition in a foreign land
or who underestimate the

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.267
importance of cultivating
friendly relations with the

00:05:52.267 --> 00:05:55.500
southern white man, who is
their next-door neighbor,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.900
I would say: "Cast down your
bucket where you are"-- cast

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.400
it down in making friends
in every manly way of the

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.800
people of all races by
whom we are surrounded.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.300
Now that's--that's frankly
just show and tell.&nbsp; That's

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.700
Booker T.&nbsp; Washington,
reading from his famous

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.667
Cotton--Atlanta Cotton
Exposition address.&nbsp; I know

00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:19.700
it's hard to hear, but I'm
going to go over it.&nbsp; And

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.067
it's also in the reading for
this week.&nbsp; But it really

00:06:23.067 --> 00:06:27.800
is--we're entering a new
technological age for the

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.300
whole country, and sound
certainly is part of this

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.500
technological innovation.&nbsp;
And we'll be seeing more of

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.767
this as this
course goes along,

00:06:37.767 --> 00:06:40.000
more sound files
and movie clips,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.100
certainly.&nbsp; Now again, I
know it's in your reading,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.800
but it's important that we
belabor part of the Cotton

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.100
Exposition address, because
it sets up--it lays down

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.200
sort of the political
foundation for so much of

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.500
the late nineteenth century
political philosophy.&nbsp; The

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.467
clip you just
heard, that's Booker T.

00:07:01.467 --> 00:07:04.500
Washington saying, A ship
lost at sea for many days

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.000
suddenly sighted a
friendly vessel.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.200
From the mast of the
unfortunate vessel was seen

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.100
a signal, "Water,
water; we die of thirst!"

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.400
The answer from the friendly
vessel at once came back,

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.900
"Cast down your
bucket where you are."

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.400
A second time the
signal, "Water,

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.900
water, send us water!"

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.367
ran up from the
distressed vessel,

00:07:23.367 --> 00:07:26.667
and was answered, "Cast down
your bucket where you are."

00:07:26.667 --> 00:07:28.700
And a third and fourth
signal for water was

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.900
answered, "Cast down
your bucket where you are."

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.300
The captain of the
distressed vessel,

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.100
at last heeding
the injunction,

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.567
cast down his bucket, and
it came up full of fresh,

00:07:38.567 --> 00:07:41.900
sparkling water from the
mouth of the Amazon River.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.167
To those of my race who
depend on bettering their

00:07:45.167 --> 00:07:48.167
condition in a foreign land
or who underestimate the

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:50.300
importance of cultivating
friendly relations with the

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.200
southern white man, who is
their next-door neighbor,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.667
I would say: "Cast down
your bucket where you are;

00:07:55.667 --> 00:07:58.067
cast it down in making
friends in every manly way

00:07:58.067 --> 00:08:03.400
of the people of all races
by whom we are surrounded.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.900
Cast it down in
agriculture, mechanics,

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.500
in commerce, in
domestic service,

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.300
and in the professions.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.200
And in this connection it
is well to bear in mind that

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.467
whatever other sins the
South may be called to bear,

00:08:15.467 --> 00:08:18.000
when it comes to
business, pure and simple,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
it is in the South that
the Negro is given a man's

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.900
chance in the
commercial world,

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.667
and in nothing is this
Exposition--and in nothing

00:08:26.667 --> 00:08:29.300
is this Exposition is more
eloquent than in emphasizing

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.700
this chance.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.400
Our greatest danger is
that in the great leap from

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.900
slavery to freedom we may
overlook the fact that the

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.367
masses of us are to live
by the productions of our

00:08:38.367 --> 00:08:41.800
hands, and fail to keep in
mind that we shall prosper

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.567
in proportion as we are--as
we learn to dignify and

00:08:44.567 --> 00:08:47.800
glorify common labour, and
put brains and skill into

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:53.000
the common occupations of
life.&nbsp; No race can prosper

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.567
till it learns that there is
as much dignity in tilling a

00:08:55.567 --> 00:08:58.067
field as in writing a poem.

00:08:58.067 --> 00:09:00.400
It is at the bottom
of life we must begin,

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.367
and not at the top.

00:09:02.367 --> 00:09:04.967
Nor should we permit our
grievances to overshadow our

00:09:04.967 --> 00:09:09.700
opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp; To those of
the white race who look to

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.300
the incoming of those of
foreign birth and strange

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.767
tongue and habits for the
prosperity of the South,

00:09:14.767 --> 00:09:17.267
were I permitted I would
repeat what I say to my own

00:09:17.267 --> 00:09:20.300
race, "Cast down your
bucket where you are."

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.700
Cast it down among the eight
millions of Negroes whose

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.600
habits you know, whose
fidelity and love you have

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.500
tested in days when to have
proved treacherous meant the

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.900
ruins of your firesides.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.200
Cast down your bucket
among these people who have,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.667
without strikes
and labor wars,

00:09:34.667 --> 00:09:37.000
tilled your fields,
cleared your forests,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.600
builded your
railroads and cities,

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.700
and brought forth treasures
from the bowels of the

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.067
earth, and helped make
possible this magnificent

00:09:43.067 --> 00:09:46.567
representation of the
progress of the South.

00:09:46.567 --> 00:09:48.800
Casting down your
bucket among my people,

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.067
helping and encouraging them
as you are doing on these

00:09:51.067 --> 00:09:55.100
grounds, and to educate--and
to education of head,

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.700
hand, and heart, you will
find that they will buy your

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.800
surplus land, make blossom
the waste places of your

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.567
fields, and run
your factories.

00:10:03.567 --> 00:10:05.800
While doing this, you
can be sure in the future,

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.100
as in the past, that you
and your families will be

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.000
surrounded by
the most patient,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.100
faithful, law-abiding, and
unresentful people that the

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.600
world has ever seen.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.167
As we have proved our
loyalty to you in the past,

00:10:18.167 --> 00:10:20.767
in nursing your children,
watching by the sick-bed of

00:10:20.767 --> 00:10:23.300
your mothers and fathers,
and often following them

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.400
with tear-dimmed
eyes to their graves,

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.900
so in the future,
in our humble way,

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.400
we shall stand by you with a
devotion that no foreigner

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.700
can approach, ready
to lay down our lives,

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.600
if need be, in
defense of yours,

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.467
interlacing our
industrial, commercial,

00:10:36.467 --> 00:10:39.067
civil, and religious life
with yours in a way that

00:10:39.067 --> 00:10:42.700
shall make the
interests of both races one.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.900
In all things that are
purely social we can be as

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.300
separate as the fingers,
yet one as the hand in all

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.467
things essential
to mutual progress.

00:10:53.467 --> 00:10:56.167
The wisest of my race
understand that the

00:10:56.167 --> 00:10:58.400
agitation of questions
of social equality is the

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.667
extremest folly, and that
progress in the enjoyment of

00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:04.467
all the privileges that
will come to us must be the

00:11:04.467 --> 00:11:07.567
result of severe and
constant struggle rather

00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:09.800
than of artificial forcing.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.000
No race that has anything
to contribute to the modern

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.100
world--to the markets of the
world is long in any degree

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.400
ostracized.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.200
It is important and right
that all privileges of the

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.867
law be ours, but it is
vastly more important that

00:11:23.867 --> 00:11:25.600
we be prepared for
the exercise of these

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.067
privileges.

00:11:27.067 --> 00:11:30.400
The opportunity to earn a
dollar in a factory just now

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.900
is worth infinitely more
than the opportunity to

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.300
spend a dollar in
an opera house.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.000
Three excerpts from
this critical speech,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.700
1895.&nbsp; The clip I played and
the excerpt I began reading

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.500
revolves around the phrase
"cast down your bucket."&nbsp;

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:55.167
It's a compelling
story, a ship lost at sea,

00:11:55.167 --> 00:11:58.700
not realizing it's at the
mouth of the Amazon River,

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.400
thinking it's going to die,
and safety was all around

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.900
it.&nbsp; Washington is
telling the members of the

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.400
Atlanta--Atlanta
Cotton Exposition,

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.100
gathering of
business leaders,

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:19.367
trying to raise
money to save the South,

00:12:19.367 --> 00:12:24.700
or improve the South
in economic terms.&nbsp;

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.900
Washington's telling them
that they need to trust

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:36.500
blacks to do the right
thing.&nbsp; He's telling the

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.500
white industrialists,
the agricultural leaders,

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.200
you know, "You're trying
to import immigrant labor.&nbsp;

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.300
Don't do it.&nbsp; There's a
not a tradition of labor

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.500
organizing,
union organizing,

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:52.400
and strikes among blacks."&nbsp;
That's because they weren't

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.700
allowed in unions.&nbsp; That's
another issue of course.&nbsp;

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.367
But Washington's telling
the white owners of the

00:12:58.367 --> 00:13:00.800
factories, and the
mills, and the fields,

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.300
"This is a
workforce you can trust,

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:08.000
who's toiled by you, who's
nurtured you and nursed you,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.500
and we'll be
faithful.&nbsp; We've proved our

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.000
faithfulness in the
past."&nbsp; So it's a nativist

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.167
argument.&nbsp; "We don't want
foreign labor in here."&nbsp;

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.400
It's also an argument about
race management.&nbsp; He begins

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:26.700
by telling blacks, "Look,
you can't agitate.&nbsp; You need

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.400
to recognize that
this is our home,

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:34.000
the South, and the rural
South.&nbsp; This is where we are

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
and this where we need to
make our futures.&nbsp; And with

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.600
patience, and with time,
as we prove our fidelity,

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.300
we'll be able to demonstrate
that we are worthy of buying

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.300
that land,
tilling our own fields,

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:55.000
becoming economically
independent."&nbsp; As he says

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.200
himself, "The wisest among
our race understand that the

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.467
agitation of questions
of social equality is the

00:13:59.467 --> 00:14:02.200
extremest folly."&nbsp; It's a
take it slow approach.&nbsp;

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:11.400
Now--oh one other very
important phrase to know

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.400
from the Atlanta Cotton
Exposition address is this

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.600
sentence:&nbsp; "That in all
things that are purely

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.367
social, we can be as
separate as the fingers;

00:14:24.367 --> 00:14:26.800
yet one is the hand on all
things essential to mutual

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.967
progress."&nbsp; Critically
important sentence,

00:14:30.967 --> 00:14:37.700
and you'll start to see
why.&nbsp; This is 1895.&nbsp; The

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:42.300
next year, the Supreme Court
hands down its--hands down

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.400
its decision in Plessey v.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.600
Ferguson.&nbsp; The
majority of the court,

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.100
in an eight to one decision,
holds the following: We

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.400
consider the underlying
fallacy of the plaintiff's

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.167
argument to consist in the
assumption that the enforced

00:14:58.167 --> 00:15:01.400
separation of the races
stamps the colored race with

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.300
a badge of inferiority.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.800
If this be so, it is not by
reason of anything found in

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.667
the act, but solely because
the colored race chooses to

00:15:10.667 --> 00:15:12.667
put that construction on it.

00:15:15.267 --> 00:15:17.200
The majority is
saying--claiming that

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.900
separation of the races
stamps the colored race with

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.000
a badge of inferiority, is
all in the colored race's

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.567
head.&nbsp; Badge of
inferiority.&nbsp; The dissent

00:15:29.567 --> 00:15:32.800
written by--well he's
the only person writing

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.500
it--Justice John
Harlan, says that ...

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.767
the arbitrary separation of
the citizens on the basis of

00:15:38.767 --> 00:15:41.067
race, while they're
on a public highway,

00:15:41.067 --> 00:15:44.267
is a badge of servitude,
wholly inconsistent with the

00:15:44.267 --> 00:15:46.000
civil freedom and the
equality before the law

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.400
established by
the Constitution.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:52.000
The majority is saying
the badge of inferiority is

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.400
nonexistent.&nbsp; It's a
construction.&nbsp; It's in their

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.700
minds.&nbsp; And Harlan says
exactly the opposite.&nbsp; It is

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:04.967
a badge of servitude to
force the separation of the

00:16:04.967 --> 00:16:09.000
races in public
accommodations.&nbsp; Now what

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.500
was Plessey?&nbsp; What was this
case about?&nbsp; Many of you

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.900
know, I'm sure, the
outlines of it.&nbsp; June 7th,

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:21.300
1892, Homer Plessey, a U.S.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.900
citizen,
resident of Louisiana,

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:28.400
buys a first class rail
ticket.&nbsp; He boards the train

00:16:30.767 --> 00:16:35.267
and takes a seat in the
first class coach.&nbsp; It's a

00:16:35.267 --> 00:16:38.400
whites only coach.&nbsp; You
wouldn't be surprised,

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:45.800
I imagine, he's asked to
move.&nbsp; Conductor understands

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.267
that he's not white.&nbsp;
And Plessey refuses and is

00:16:50.267 --> 00:16:54.700
thrown off the train and
thrown into jail.&nbsp; He's

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.467
broken the Jim Crow laws of
segregation of the races in

00:16:58.467 --> 00:17:04.467
Louisiana, the statute
established in 1890.&nbsp; Homer

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.500
Plessey argued that such
segregation violated the

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.867
Thirteenth and
Fourteenth Amendments of the

00:17:12.867 --> 00:17:17.000
Constitution.&nbsp; The Supreme
Court said in response,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.767
three years later, that
racial separation did not

00:17:21.767 --> 00:17:23.900
abridge the privileges
or immunities of U.S.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.200
citizens, or deprive persons
of liberty or property

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.800
without the due
process of the laws,

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.600
you know, the tenets of the
Thirteenth and Fourteenth

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.967
Amendment.&nbsp; The Supreme
Court says it doesn't do any

00:17:34.967 --> 00:17:37.400
of these things, separating
the races.&nbsp; There's still

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.400
due process.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.500
You still have rights as
a citizen.&nbsp; Now Plessey,

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.467
it's worth knowing, was
convinced he would win this

00:17:42.467 --> 00:17:46.800
case.&nbsp; He actually pursued
the legal crisis in the

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.300
first place.&nbsp; He didn't just
walk up to the ticket booth

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.567
thinking, "I'm going to buy
a first class rail ticket

00:17:51.567 --> 00:17:53.700
and have a nice
quiet ride," you know,

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.200
"to my destination."&nbsp; He
knew the law.&nbsp; He thought it

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.000
was wrong, and so he
decided to test it,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.100
and he thought he would
win.&nbsp; And Plessey really

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.400
also thought that he
would win it because his own

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:16.500
literal embodiment would
prove how absurd segregation

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.867
practices and laws really
were.&nbsp; Going by the very

00:18:20.867 --> 00:18:25.000
clumsy and messy sort of
dividing one's up one's

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.200
blood by races, Plessey
was seventh--seven-eighths

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.067
white, and was
so fair skinned,

00:18:33.067 --> 00:18:37.100
he could easily pass
for white.&nbsp; In fact,

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.300
he had to confirm
with the conductors,

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.000
"Yeah, I'm black."&nbsp;
The law of the land is,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.067
if you had just one, quote,
"drop of black blood" you

00:18:44.067 --> 00:18:50.067
were black.&nbsp; So Plessey
ostensibly is a white man,

00:18:52.067 --> 00:18:55.700
ostensibly, has
black heritage,

00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:02.100
so he is black
legally.&nbsp; Would only,

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.367
you know, only by declaring
his race would people

00:19:04.367 --> 00:19:06.300
realize that he was breaking
a law in the first place.&nbsp;

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.067
He says, "The
law is ridiculous,

00:19:08.067 --> 00:19:10.600
and I'm going to test it,
and I'm going to win it."

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.800
Well, he misjudged the
justices.&nbsp; So you have,

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.367
starting in 1866 but
speeding up and going from

00:19:18.367 --> 00:19:22.467
miscegenation to
education to transportation,

00:19:22.467 --> 00:19:26.900
generally speaking, a range
of Jim Crow laws separating

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.400
the races.&nbsp; When Plessey v.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.900
Ferguson is decided,
announced in 1895,

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:39.800
separate but equal is
established as in line with

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:46.067
the Constitution, and it
will remain the law until

00:19:46.067 --> 00:19:47.067
Brown v.

00:19:47.067 --> 00:19:50.767
Board of Education's passed,
ah passed?&nbsp; Declared in

00:19:50.767 --> 00:19:56.767
185--1954.&nbsp; So we're talking
about almost sixty years of

00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:04.000
constitutionally
supported federal law,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.367
and then state laws,
established with Plessey v.

00:20:08.367 --> 00:20:10.400
Ferguson.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.867
Now the Supreme Court
offers its decision in 1896,

00:20:17.167 --> 00:20:21.967
but the case had been in
process since 1892.&nbsp; Why

00:20:21.967 --> 00:20:23.900
does this matter?&nbsp; I mean we
all know these things take a

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.300
while to bubble up to the
Supreme Court.&nbsp; It matters

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.567
because there's no
doubt that when Booker T.

00:20:30.567 --> 00:20:34.067
Washington rose to speak at
the Atlanta--Atlanta Cotton

00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:37.400
Exposition in 1895, he knew
that efforts were underway

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.800
to challenge racial
separation.&nbsp; Washington,

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.767
however, openly and famously
accommodated to white

00:20:45.767 --> 00:20:50.167
southern and northern
business interests.&nbsp; This

00:20:50.167 --> 00:20:52.900
was not a little quiet case
kind of trickling its way up

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.000
through the system.&nbsp;
Washington was a well

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.400
educated man.&nbsp; He knew
about race politics,

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:04.700
of course.&nbsp; And so he made a
conscious decision in 1895

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:08.000
to declare that he's on the
side of southern business

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.667
interests and
northern business interests,

00:21:09.667 --> 00:21:12.267
separating the races to
reduce racial anxiety of

00:21:12.267 --> 00:21:17.500
these whites.&nbsp; He
knew that Plessey v.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.700
Ferguson was being fleshed
out--fleshed out in the

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:25.700
legal system.&nbsp; So when
you take these two moments

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:33.600
together, Washington's
speech and Plessey,

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.667
you can see that for many,
this embodies sort of the

00:21:37.667 --> 00:21:39.900
low point that I referenced
in Monday's lecture,

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.867
the low point of the
post-emancipation African

00:21:42.867 --> 00:21:45.700
American experience,
certainly in the realm of

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.367
political
rights, equal rights,

00:21:48.367 --> 00:21:54.100
full citizenship rights.&nbsp;
Now it's pretty easy to

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.167
launch into an extended
critique of Washington,

00:21:57.167 --> 00:22:00.367
especially in light of the
context of the era when he's

00:22:00.367 --> 00:22:04.167
giving this famous speech.&nbsp;
But let me give you a bit of

00:22:04.167 --> 00:22:07.867
biography and put us in his
shoes in a bit to see his

00:22:07.867 --> 00:22:11.400
world view, and see where we
end up.&nbsp; Washington is born

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:16.400
in 1856.&nbsp; He's born a
slave.&nbsp; He worked as a

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:21.600
child, before emancipation
and after emancipation.&nbsp; He

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:28.300
knew--his life was a life
of work.&nbsp; He's out in the

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:33.000
coalfields in West Virginia
and then finds out about

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.200
this school, this
college, called the Hampton

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:40.267
Institute, in the far
east coast of Virginia,

00:22:40.267 --> 00:22:45.000
and he decides this
is the place for him.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.867
And so he literally works
his way there via odd jobs.&nbsp;

00:22:47.867 --> 00:22:50.600
He has no money, so he's
working odd jobs to get some

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:56.100
more money to--to find a
way to get to the next way

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.600
station, before he
finds himself in Hampton,

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.000
Virginia, at the Institute.&nbsp;
And he's working odd jobs

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.467
there, while in school.&nbsp;
And at the end of the term,

00:23:05.467 --> 00:23:06.600
at the end of
the school year,

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.967
he worked his way back home,
literally working his way

00:23:09.967 --> 00:23:11.800
back home.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:16.400
&nbsp;Through his labor
and his intellect,

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.967
he becomes the school's--the
protégé of the school's

00:23:19.967 --> 00:23:24.267
principal.&nbsp; Hampton,
it's important to know,

00:23:24.267 --> 00:23:28.900
was an institute dedicated
to vocational education.&nbsp;

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.800
That was the rationale
of the Hampton--Hampton

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:36.400
Institute.&nbsp; Learning crafts
and skills was critical.&nbsp;

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:41.100
This is about how to become
a better manager of crops,

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:45.800
how to become an expert
cabinetmaker.&nbsp; It was about

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:51.600
trying to develop technical
expertise in agricultural

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:57.200
endeavors, for
instance.&nbsp; The idea of,

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.600
you know, high
culture, elite refinement,

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:06.700
these things
could wait.&nbsp; In 1881,

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.467
Washington is
twenty-one--twenty-five

00:24:08.467 --> 00:24:12.800
years old, and with the
support of his mentor at the

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:17.600
Hampton Institute,
establishes his own

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.267
institute, called the
Tuskegee Institute.&nbsp; Now

00:24:21.267 --> 00:24:23.100
Hampton and Tuskegee are
still around today.&nbsp; They

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.100
are very different than they
were before--they were at

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.600
this, this era.&nbsp; We're
talking about the founding

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.500
moments.&nbsp; So Washington
establishes the Tuskegee

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.400
Institute, in
Tuskegee, Alabama,

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.500
and it's really quite
remarkable.&nbsp; He's--he's

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:40.867
establishing something at
the heart of white farming

00:24:40.867 --> 00:24:45.667
land in Alabama.&nbsp; And
what you see in establishing

00:24:45.667 --> 00:24:49.800
Tuskegee is Washington's
incredible skills at

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:54.767
building coalitions, at not
appearing threatening to a

00:24:54.767 --> 00:24:58.700
white elite, or even
white small farmers,

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.700
yeoman farmers.&nbsp; He starts
buying up land for this

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.900
institute.&nbsp; He--he
gets his first students,

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.200
and they start building,
literally building,

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.000
this institute.&nbsp;
And eventually,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.900
Tuskegee, the institute,
becomes the life blood of

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:19.100
Tuskegee, the community.&nbsp; It
becomes the economic engine

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:23.500
of this town.&nbsp; And this is
in a way a manifestation of

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.500
Booker T.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.067
Washington's long term
strategy.&nbsp; I'm not saying

00:25:28.067 --> 00:25:32.200
Tuskegee was a racial oasis,
or that blacks were fully

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.167
integrated, but
through Washington's model,

00:25:35.167 --> 00:25:40.000
he economically integrated
blacks into Tuskegee,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:47.700
the town.&nbsp; And this is his
long-term plan.&nbsp; Eventually,

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.600
blacks will get
their full rights,

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.400
but they do it
through long, slow,

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:58.600
hard work, through labor,
and becomes--by becoming so

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.300
economically vital
to wherever they are,

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.200
one could not help but
strive to incorporate them

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.967
in society.&nbsp; This
very go-slow approach,

00:26:09.967 --> 00:26:15.400
Washington's great skills
at interacting with and

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.800
negotiating with
white business leaders,

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.400
results in he
becoming the darling of the

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:24.467
philanthropists and starts
getting money thrown at him,

00:26:24.467 --> 00:26:28.600
by especially
northern business interests,

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.700
allowing him to build
up Tuskegee further,

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.800
and allowing him over the
course of the next twenty or

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.100
so years, to build
up--especially after 1895,

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.767
the last twenty years of his
life--he dies in 1915--to

00:26:40.767 --> 00:26:48.567
build up a set of--a
portfolio of power that

00:26:48.567 --> 00:26:51.167
leaves one with no other
conclusion to draw except he

00:26:51.167 --> 00:26:53.200
was the most powerful
black person in the country,

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.967
undisputed leader of the
race.&nbsp; If a newspaper didn't

00:26:58.967 --> 00:27:01.100
like his ideology
and ran editorials,

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.967
he would buy the newspaper
and fire the editors,

00:27:02.967 --> 00:27:04.300
put his own
editors in place,

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.500
kind of like
Rupert--Rupert Murdoch,

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.500
right?

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:13.700
I mean he was a sort of
mogul in black America.&nbsp; An

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.200
advisor to President
Teddy--Teddy Roosevelt,

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.767
much to the great anger and
fear of many people in white

00:27:20.767 --> 00:27:24.000
America.&nbsp; Now time to ask
some critical questions.&nbsp; On

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.700
one side, you can
ask the question,

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:33.600
well why did philanthropists
chip in?&nbsp; Was it because of

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.100
his charm?&nbsp; Well, I mean,
these were businessmen.&nbsp;

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:40.500
They--they had their
interests at heart here.&nbsp;

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.800
They saw that Washington was
training a fantastic worker

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.900
base.&nbsp; He'd follow
the Washington model,

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.800
very smart workers, trained
in certain skills and

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.100
crafts, ideal
for their mills,

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:55.800
factories, and such.&nbsp;
And he's also training a

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.100
permanent second
class citizen,

00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:01.400
so this will be a docile
workforce.&nbsp; That's exactly

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.200
what the factory owners
want.&nbsp; A smart workforce is

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:09.300
not going to raise any
problems.&nbsp; Now asking a

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.467
question from the
other side--I mean,

00:28:10.467 --> 00:28:12.667
it's so easy to sort of
condemn Washington for all

00:28:12.667 --> 00:28:14.167
these different--these
reasons I've outlined just

00:28:14.167 --> 00:28:19.567
now, but let's think
about where he was living,

00:28:19.567 --> 00:28:21.567
what he was advocating.

00:28:21.567 --> 00:28:24.700
What really was possible in
the Deep South in the late

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:29.000
nineteenth century?&nbsp;
We already talked about

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.967
lynching, rise of all kinds
of laws to wipe out the

00:28:33.967 --> 00:28:36.767
black vote.&nbsp; The black vote
is disappearing radically

00:28:36.767 --> 00:28:39.000
during this period in
the very last years of the

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.500
nineteenth century.&nbsp;
Seventy-five percent of

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:45.267
blacks still lived in
the Confederate South,

00:28:45.267 --> 00:28:47.567
and the great majority
of that percentage were

00:28:47.567 --> 00:28:50.900
agricultural workers.&nbsp;
Blacks were on the farms.&nbsp;

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:59.400
Half of the total southern
population was black,

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.067
but blacks owned just over
ten percent of the farms.&nbsp;

00:29:05.267 --> 00:29:07.300
There was essentially no
agricultural education--I

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:11.367
mean the Tuskeegees are--the
Tuskegee kinds of model are

00:29:11.367 --> 00:29:15.467
the exceptions--and black
farm production is low.

00:29:15.467 --> 00:29:17.967
So you have a population
that is an aggrieved

00:29:17.967 --> 00:29:19.767
population
politically, socially,

00:29:19.767 --> 00:29:24.700
economically, with
very limited mobility,

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:30.700
almost no mobility,
living in a--in a state,

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.267
one could make the argument,
of terror.&nbsp; So when you

00:29:34.267 --> 00:29:36.400
think about the lived
conditions of African

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.400
Americans, the
great majority of them,

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.700
what were the alternatives,
except for try to find a way

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.400
to develop
economic independence,

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.800
and then in time
become recognized as fully

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.967
participating in the--in the
citizenship rights of the

00:29:53.967 --> 00:29:56.300
United States.&nbsp; What
might have been a logical

00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:01.200
alternative?&nbsp; Well, the
alternative to Washington

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.100
and his accommodationist
politics is embodied in W.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.100
E.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.100
B.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.600
Du Bois.&nbsp; Now it's important
to remember that Anna Julia

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:12.100
Cooper joined
the debate first,

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.600
arguing in A
Voice from the South,

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.767
published in 1892, that
the race would be saved by

00:30:16.767 --> 00:30:19.967
investing in higher
education.&nbsp; This comes a

00:30:19.967 --> 00:30:21.867
full decade before Du Bois
steps up to the plate and

00:30:21.867 --> 00:30:26.500
challenges Washington.&nbsp;
But the fact is,

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.800
for better and for
worse, the debate has been

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.200
crystallized into a Du
Bois-Washington debate.&nbsp;

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:42.867
Certainly Washington
because he was so powerful,

00:30:42.867 --> 00:30:45.400
and also certainly Du
Bois, partly because gender

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.900
dynamics and our
national culture,

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:52.900
of course, but because the
man plays central roles in

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.467
many different
moments of articulating,

00:30:54.467 --> 00:30:58.200
shifting black politics over
the course of the next sixty

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:03.667
years.&nbsp; Du Bois's
response to Washington was

00:31:03.667 --> 00:31:07.167
straightforward.&nbsp;
He referred to the

00:31:07.167 --> 00:31:11.467
Atlanta--Atlanta Cotton
Exposition address as the

00:31:11.467 --> 00:31:14.800
Atlanta Compromise.&nbsp; And
he said in his very famous

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.100
critique of Washington,
and I quote here,

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.700
that, "manly self respect
is worth more than lands and

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:24.000
houses, and that a people
who voluntarily surrender

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.400
such respect, or
cease striving for it,

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.000
are not worth civilizing."

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.267
Manly self respect is the
most important thing.&nbsp; It's

00:31:32.267 --> 00:31:34.067
more important than
lands and houses,

00:31:34.067 --> 00:31:38.000
and if you don't have the
courage to stand up to the

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.600
system that's fighting,
that's pushing you down,

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.200
you're not worth
civilizing.&nbsp; Now this

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.000
phrasing here is
rather important,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.267
harkening back to the last
two lectures: manliness and

00:31:48.267 --> 00:31:52.500
civilization.&nbsp; Du Bois
embodies this very elitist,

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:59.600
Eurocentric world view that
supports a manly ideal and

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:03.367
thinks it's the--it's the
really--it's the real goal

00:32:03.367 --> 00:32:06.167
to demonstrate one's
capacity to act in a

00:32:06.167 --> 00:32:09.300
civilized fashion,
to be civilized,

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:14.100
if you're really
going to have a chance at

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.867
entertaining full
citizenship rights.&nbsp; Du Bois

00:32:17.867 --> 00:32:21.100
challenged Washington's call
for blacks to give up their

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:25.167
political power, their
insistence on civil rights,

00:32:25.167 --> 00:32:27.067
and their desire for the
higher education of black

00:32:27.067 --> 00:32:30.800
youth.&nbsp; Du Bois advocated
that the Talented Tenth,

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:34.467
this idea he developed
from Henry Morehouse,

00:32:34.467 --> 00:32:36.900
advocated the Talented Tenth
be educated at the finest

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.500
institutions in
order to save the race.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.700
&nbsp;Now why is Du Bois so
invested in this agenda?&nbsp;

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.800
Mainly because it reflected
a large part of his own life

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.100
experience, and a glance
at his biography makes this

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:53.167
much clearer.&nbsp; Du Bois
was born in 1868 in Great

00:32:53.167 --> 00:32:55.767
Barrington, Massachusetts,
just about an hour and a

00:32:55.767 --> 00:32:58.900
half--about an hour and
a half from here.&nbsp; It is

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.767
beginning to be
recognized actually,

00:33:00.767 --> 00:33:03.700
in Great Barrington for
being one of its more famous

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:08.400
sons, as the phrase might
be.&nbsp; He goes to college in

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:13.000
the South at Fisk University
in Nashville and he gets his

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Ph.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
D.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.600
at Harvard in 1895,
again, that important year,

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:22.500
after having studied for
some time at Berlin.&nbsp; He

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.467
publishes the
groundbreaking--groundbreaki

00:33:24.467 --> 00:33:29.100
ng sociological study called
The Philadelphia Negro in

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.300
1898, I believe, essentially
creating the field of urban

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:36.100
sociology in the process,
and he helps establish the

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.500
America Negro Academy.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.400
So just in this--in the
moment when Booker T.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:43.400
Washington's rising up,
and bursts onto the national

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.200
scene with his Atlanta
Cotton Exposition address,

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.767
Du Bois is getting the
finest education in the

00:33:49.767 --> 00:33:51.767
world, quite
literally, gets his Ph.

00:33:51.767 --> 00:33:55.200
D., the very first
generation of African

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.267
Americans to
get that degree,

00:33:58.267 --> 00:34:00.567
establishes the field
of urban sociology,

00:34:00.567 --> 00:34:04.600
helps establish the
American Negro Academy,

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.900
and then starts an academic
career for the very first

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:10.700
phase of his life, teaching
at Atlanta University.&nbsp; So

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:15.767
Du Bois espouses and
embodies the value of higher

00:34:15.767 --> 00:34:18.067
education and the role that
the black intellectual would

00:34:18.067 --> 00:34:23.000
play in the salvation of the
race.&nbsp; He was at the time

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.867
one of the most
educated--highly educated

00:34:24.867 --> 00:34:28.300
people in the world, and he
had a very full sense of his

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.100
own talent--the man had
an ego bigger than this

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:38.500
room--and his sense of value
to the world.&nbsp; He really

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.800
believed that politically
and intellectually engaged

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.367
scholars were the very
best--very best people to

00:34:43.367 --> 00:34:45.300
interpret the white
European world.&nbsp; Again,

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.167
that idea, sort of
that's where the seat of

00:34:47.167 --> 00:34:52.400
civilization is.&nbsp; And
you can see this belief

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:58.467
manifested or in the pages
of what people regard as Du

00:34:58.467 --> 00:35:02.000
Bois's great classic, The
Souls of Black Folk.&nbsp; How

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.900
many of you have read The
Souls of Black Folk?&nbsp; Just a

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.600
handful, well
more than a handful.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.367
About okay about
a sixth of you,

00:35:08.367 --> 00:35:10.900
fifth of you, sixth of you.&nbsp;
Or read in it?&nbsp; Maybe more

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.400
hands would go up.&nbsp;
It's really amazing,

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.500
because when I
started grad school,

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.867
I went to grad school here,
I was introduced to Du Bois

00:35:20.867 --> 00:35:23.400
and The Souls of Black Folk
in the spring of my first

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.867
year in grad school.&nbsp;
He wasn't part of the

00:35:26.867 --> 00:35:29.400
undergraduate curriculum,
except in just a few kind of

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:33.567
strange places.&nbsp; Now it's
the undergraduate curriculum

00:35:33.567 --> 00:35:36.400
like crazy, and I understand
it's even being taught in

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.867
some high schools.&nbsp; I mean
this is a radical change in

00:35:38.867 --> 00:35:43.200
just twenty years, in terms
of Du Bois being brought

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:48.400
back into our national
narrative.&nbsp; Now The Souls of

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.700
Black Folk¸ you have an
excerpt from it in the

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:55.400
Marable and Mullings
reader.&nbsp; I'm not going to

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.767
belabor the history of
that early remarkable book,

00:35:58.767 --> 00:36:02.267
but I do want to focus
on one quick passage,

00:36:02.267 --> 00:36:06.067
really about the most cited
passage of the entire book.&nbsp;

00:36:06.067 --> 00:36:08.700
And it's--it's a passage
that refers to the conundrum

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:14.300
of double-consciousness.&nbsp;
In Souls of Black Folk,

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.467
Du Bois recounts his youth
growing up in a diverse

00:36:16.467 --> 00:36:19.167
community where he never
felt the sting of race until

00:36:19.167 --> 00:36:22.400
his adolescence, this very
famous moment when he was--

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.100
his Valentine's Day card
that he was giving to a

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:30.867
young woman was refused.&nbsp;
He wrote about this dawning

00:36:30.867 --> 00:36:32.600
awareness of the
racial differences in his

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:36.067
community, and his own
physical appearance,

00:36:36.067 --> 00:36:39.800
and he said that this
awareness amounted to,

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.900
or he equated it to, a veil
that separated the races.&nbsp;

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:46.467
And he writes: ...

00:36:46.467 --> 00:36:48.900
the Negro is sort
of a seventh son,

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.900
born with a veil, and gifted
with second-sight in this

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.900
American world, a world
which yields him no true

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:58.700
self-consciousness, but only
lets him see himself through

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.200
the revelation of
the other world.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.767
It is a peculiar
sensation, this

00:37:02.767 --> 00:37:05.000
double-conscious--consciousn
ess,

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
this sense of always looking
to one's self through the

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.300
eyes of others, of measuring
one's soul by the tape of a

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.667
world that looks
through the--excuse me,

00:37:12.667 --> 00:37:15.900
I skipped a line here-- It
is a peculiar sensation,

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.400
this double--consciousness,
this sense of always looking

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.367
to one's self through
the eyes of others,

00:37:20.367 --> 00:37:22.867
of measuring one's soul by
the tape of a world that

00:37:22.867 --> 00:37:26.000
looks on in amused
contempt and pity.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.900
One ever feels his
twoness: an American,

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:32.500
a Negro; two
souls, two thoughts,

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.967
two unreconciled strivings;
two warring ideals in one

00:37:35.967 --> 00:37:39.100
dark body, whose dogged
strength alone keeps it from

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.200
being torn asunder.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:46.867
A veil separating the
races.&nbsp; The passage is

00:37:46.867 --> 00:37:48.700
important for the way in
which Du Bois describes the

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:52.300
differences in perspective
between white and black

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:56.600
worlds.&nbsp; As Ralph Ellison
would mention some forty or

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.567
fifty years
later in his book,

00:38:00.567 --> 00:38:03.300
the differences that
rendered blacks invisible to

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.300
white America.&nbsp; I'm
referencing Ellison's

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:10.667
classic The Invisible
Man here.&nbsp; Du Bois says,

00:38:10.667 --> 00:38:16.700
it is as if this veil keeps
blacks hidden from view.&nbsp;

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:20.400
But veils, as we know, allow
the wearer to see the world

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.500
outside.&nbsp; This is black
America's special gift,

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.900
according to Du Bois, that
they can see America from a

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:31.667
perspective that was all but
invisible to whites.&nbsp; This

00:38:31.667 --> 00:38:35.000
gift, however, was also
a curse.&nbsp; It kept blacks

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.967
removed from the daily
commerce of culture,

00:38:36.967 --> 00:38:39.500
society,
politics, economics,

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:42.900
so forth.&nbsp; Now why do I
linger on this point?

00:38:45.567 --> 00:38:47.167
I linger on it because it
gets to the heart of the

00:38:47.167 --> 00:38:49.700
problem that Du Bois felt
that black scholars like

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:53.100
himself had to deal with.&nbsp;
They were best positioned to

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:57.200
solve these problems, and
yet they couldn't be heard

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.167
and couldn't be seen
by the white world,

00:39:00.167 --> 00:39:01.967
but they were in the best
position to interpret those

00:39:01.967 --> 00:39:04.600
worlds to each
other.&nbsp; And in this way,

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.300
Washington and Du Bois are
actually quite alike.&nbsp; They

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:09.500
both sought to be
interpreters of the black

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.400
experience to white
America.&nbsp; They both sought

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.500
in some ways to control
the means of access of each

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.500
racial cohort to the other.

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.700
In the long run, many of
their goals were the same.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:25.000
The means, however, were
profoundly different.&nbsp; It's

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.900
important to say here
that Washington was a rather

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:34.600
complicated figure.&nbsp;
Washington was very publicly

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:38.400
in support of the
separation of the races,

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.267
accommodating to northern
white business interests.&nbsp;

00:39:41.267 --> 00:39:43.967
As I mentioned before, he
owned all these newspapers,

00:39:43.967 --> 00:39:46.667
would control them if
they said anything bad about

00:39:46.667 --> 00:39:49.100
him.&nbsp; But he also funneled
money to Du Bois and other

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:53.300
activists, knowing that
public support would destroy

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:56.467
him but
recognizing that sometimes,

00:39:56.467 --> 00:39:58.300
not all the
time, but sometimes,

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:01.800
their points had merit.&nbsp; So
he would actually give Du

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.900
Bois--who had no kind of
resource like that--give Du

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:10.100
Bois through third parties
resources to continue the

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:13.200
battle.&nbsp; But in the
arena of public engagement,

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.267
public political engagement,
these two could not have

00:40:16.267 --> 00:40:20.100
been more different.&nbsp; You
can see this in high relief

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:25.900
when in 1905, two years
after Souls of Black Folk

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:29.367
was published, when Du Bois
and other college-educated

00:40:29.367 --> 00:40:32.900
black professionals meet at
Niagara Falls.&nbsp; Now they're

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.900
meeting on the
Canadian side,

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:36.800
not the New York side,
which they intended to do,

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:40.667
since the New York side
refused them lodging.&nbsp; But

00:40:40.667 --> 00:40:44.400
these black, educated black
men and a few women--Ida B.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.167
Wells was one of them--come
together to form an

00:40:47.167 --> 00:40:49.100
organization that
is dedicated to full

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:52.600
citizenship rights for black
America.&nbsp; The so called

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.600
Niagara Movement demanded a
number of things: freedom of

00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:00.800
speech and full citizenship,
manhood suffrage,

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.667
the abolition of all
distinctions based on race,

00:41:03.667 --> 00:41:05.767
the recognition of
basic principles of human

00:41:05.767 --> 00:41:08.800
fellowship, respect for
the working person.&nbsp; I went

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.200
through that quickly.&nbsp;
It's in the reader,

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:15.500
the manifesto, the Niagara
Movement's call to arms.&nbsp;

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:19.400
But it's important
to--we'll look back at that,

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.400
and think of these themes
that it's talked about.&nbsp;

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.100
Full citizenship
rights, the vote,

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:26.167
abolition of
distinctions based on race,

00:41:26.167 --> 00:41:29.800
human fellowship, respect
for the working person.&nbsp; I

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:32.500
want you to think back to
this moment in six or seven

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:33.500
weeks--well, in about three
or four weeks then six or

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:40.767
seven weeks--this is an
abiding theme of political

00:41:40.767 --> 00:41:43.467
organizing in black America
throughout much of the

00:41:43.467 --> 00:41:45.967
twentieth century.&nbsp;
Washington was invited to

00:41:45.967 --> 00:41:50.200
join the Niagara Movement.&nbsp;
He was by far the most

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.200
powerful black person in
the country.&nbsp; He was invited

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.500
mainly out of courtesy
because of his power.&nbsp; He

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:58.967
declines.&nbsp; Some of his
greatest enemies are the

00:41:58.967 --> 00:42:00.900
people organizing
the Niagara movement,

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:06.700
but at least they had to put
out that olive branch.&nbsp; But

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.600
again, Washington knew he
would lose his white support

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:14.300
base if he made that move.&nbsp;
The Niagara Movement meets

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:18.600
annually until
1909.&nbsp; That year,

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.500
some members of the group
were invited to a national

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:23.300
conference on contemporary
race relations and the

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:29.600
struggle for civil
rights.&nbsp; This group of white

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.000
activists, many of them
with abolitionist roots,

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.600
back to the
previous century,

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.100
came together because of a
race riot and a lynching.&nbsp;

00:42:40.467 --> 00:42:44.167
Heretofore popularly felt
to be a southern phenomenon,

00:42:44.167 --> 00:42:47.000
despite like the New York
City draft riots as evidence

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.800
to the contrary, this race
riot and lynching happened

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:54.567
in Springfield, Illinois
in 1908.&nbsp; The riots were

00:42:54.567 --> 00:42:57.167
horrific in their
material significance,

00:42:57.167 --> 00:43:00.100
certainly, loss of
life and property,

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:01.900
but the symbolic
significance was far

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:05.000
greater, at least for
these organizers.&nbsp; The riot

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.167
occurred on the
hundredth anniversary of

00:43:07.167 --> 00:43:09.900
Lincoln's--Abraham
Lincoln's birth,

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:13.000
and several black citizens
in Springfield are lynched

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.567
within a few blocks of
Lincoln's home and within

00:43:15.567 --> 00:43:19.800
two miles of his gravesite.&nbsp;
Now the riot started when a

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.600
white woman accused a black
worker of raping her and

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:27.700
assaulting her.&nbsp;
She later recanted,

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.667
admitting that her white
boyfriend had beat her,

00:43:30.667 --> 00:43:37.000
but it was too late.&nbsp;
Angry mobs formed and

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.267
started--started
looking for the perpetrator,

00:43:39.267 --> 00:43:40.700
who was spirited out of town
quickly.&nbsp; But the mobs start

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:44.400
forming and attacking blacks
under the impression that

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:50.100
they were the ones harboring
the rapist.&nbsp; That the Great

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:53.400
Emancipator's memory could
be so sullied horrified

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:57.100
these whites--these
white liberals,

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.300
some of whom organized
this conference and invited

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:04.100
members of the Niagara
Movement.&nbsp; Together,

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:07.200
these white liberals and
a few representatives,

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.067
these black liberals
from the Niagara Movement,

00:44:10.067 --> 00:44:12.200
decide to form a new social
betterment organization that

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.867
would be dedicated to the
pursuit of civil rights for

00:44:14.867 --> 00:44:17.000
blacks, and that
organization is the National

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.567
Association for the
Advancement of Colored

00:44:18.567 --> 00:44:22.600
people, the
NAACP.&nbsp; Du Bois joined,

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:24.800
was one of the people from
the Niagara Movement who

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.300
met-- went to
this conference,

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:31.600
and he joined the NAACP
upon its founding in 1910,

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:35.767
and serves as its sole
black officer.&nbsp; He was the

00:44:35.767 --> 00:44:37.400
director of research and
publicity for the NAACP,

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.667
and the editor
of its magazine,

00:44:39.667 --> 00:44:43.067
Crisis.&nbsp; And Du Bois would
remain at the NAACP for the

00:44:43.067 --> 00:44:45.600
next twenty-five years.&nbsp; He
would have this very vexed

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:49.500
relationship with the
organization.&nbsp; So from its

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:53.800
inception, the NAACP
needs to be understood as,

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.800
well, one, essentially a
white organization with Du

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.267
Bois as the sole
black officer,

00:45:00.267 --> 00:45:03.800
dedicated to the improvement
of quality of black life,

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:09.800
certainly.&nbsp; But the
people running the NAACP,

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:15.667
left progressives, some of
them considered radicals,

00:45:15.667 --> 00:45:18.300
were all
political agitators,

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.267
but they were agitating
toward an assimilationist

00:45:20.267 --> 00:45:23.800
goal.&nbsp; This is why Du Bois
felt so at home with this

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:30.367
sort of
politics.&nbsp; The NAACP,

00:45:30.367 --> 00:45:34.300
not to make light of the
commitment of these--these

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:36.800
radical progressive
and Du Bois as well,

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:41.000
agitating
towards assimilation,

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.567
believed that with
the proper amount,

00:45:44.567 --> 00:45:46.700
type, and style
of agitation,

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:50.100
blacks would eventually
integrate into white

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:54.700
society, economy, and
politics.&nbsp; Now the phrasing

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.567
of that is very important,
that blacks would integrate

00:45:57.567 --> 00:46:00.500
"into" white
society, economy,

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:04.267
and politics.&nbsp; The process
would not work in reverse.&nbsp;

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:11.367
So just as we can, you
know, get worked up,

00:46:11.367 --> 00:46:15.267
perhaps, about Washington's
accommodationist politics

00:46:15.267 --> 00:46:18.500
and say, you know, we're
really down for the idea of

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:22.200
Du Bois's radical politics
and assimilationist ideals,

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.200
you need to also be aware of
what these assimilationist

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:29.900
ideals were about.&nbsp; Blacks
would integrate into white

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:33.900
society, society
that was civilized,

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:38.600
and that was a descendant
of the height of civilized

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:44.600
culture in the world, and
that's Britain.&nbsp; These are

00:46:47.567 --> 00:46:51.100
complicated narratives,
but we can ask really

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:53.367
interesting questions--or
because they're complicated,

00:46:53.367 --> 00:46:57.267
we can ask really
interesting questions,

00:46:57.267 --> 00:47:00.400
sort of such that when
all is said and done,

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:05.900
with Washington's politics
being open for critique,

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:08.900
is it easier to let the
Niagara Movement's or the

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.700
NAACP's politics be free
from critique?&nbsp; There's

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:14.600
plenty of criticism to be
thrown around and lots of

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.500
critical questions to ask,
and we'll start asking those

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:19.900
questions in section and in
the weeks to come.&nbsp; Thanks

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:21.900
very much.&nbsp; Have
a great weekend.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.029
Professor Mark Saltzman:
So, today I'm going to

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.194
continue to talk about
applications of Biomedical

00:00:20.194 --> 00:00:23.212
Engineering,
so as sort of a way to bring

00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:27.487
together some of the concepts
that we've talked about over the

00:00:27.487 --> 00:00:30.873
last several months.
Tuesday, I focused on

00:00:30.873 --> 00:00:35.212
applications in cancer.
We thought about how imaging

00:00:35.212 --> 00:00:39.342
techniques, how instruments that
deliver radiation,

00:00:39.342 --> 00:00:44.050
how molecules and cells could
be used to treat cancer.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.678
Today we're going to--the focus
is going to be on artificial

00:00:48.678 --> 00:00:50.496
materials.
Biomaterials,

00:00:50.496 --> 00:00:54.138
which are widely used in
medicine now and were produced

00:00:54.138 --> 00:00:58.118
largely through the work of
material scientists and chemical

00:00:58.118 --> 00:01:01.465
engineers,
and biomedical engineers over

00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:05.680
the last 100 years or so.
We'll talk about some of the

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.073
difficulties with creating a
material that can be implanted

00:01:10.073 --> 00:01:13.055
in the body,
and we'll talk about some of

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:16.416
the applications of those
materials, particularly in

00:01:16.416 --> 00:01:21.287
artificial organs,
is where I want to end up for

00:01:21.287 --> 00:01:24.499
the day.
These are two pictures from

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:28.209
the text that I present,
just to show you that the idea

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:32.400
of using artificial materials to
replace tissues that are lost

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.519
for one reason or another,
is not new.

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:42.895
The one picture here shows a
remarkable discovery from a

00:01:42.895 --> 00:01:47.489
mummy that is something like
3,000 years old.

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:51.505
This particular mummy was a
woman who had a toe that was

00:01:51.505 --> 00:01:55.075
amputated for some reason.
The toe was replaced by a

00:01:55.075 --> 00:01:58.187
synthetic--well not a synthetic,
a natural material,

00:01:58.187 --> 00:02:01.930
fashioned to look like a toe.
This is made of wood.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.625
Just to acknowledge that people
have probably tried to use the

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:13.507
materials that were in the world
around them to replace parts of

00:02:13.507 --> 00:02:18.829
the body that were lost to
trauma or disease for thousands

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.191
of years.
We've gotten quite good at it

00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:25.301
in some senses,
but there are still significant

00:02:25.301 --> 00:02:28.334
problems left to solve.
The other slide,

00:02:28.334 --> 00:02:31.775
here, I wanted to show you what
I think is a remarkable

00:02:31.775 --> 00:02:35.154
material.
This clear part here is a lens

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:38.639
that's actually implanted into
the eye.

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:43.713
It's like a contact lens but
it's permanently placed inside

00:02:43.713 --> 00:02:48.606
the eye over your natural lens.
This is for people that have

00:02:48.606 --> 00:02:52.547
very severe difficulty in
vision, because the properties

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:55.270
of their natural lens have
changed.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.374
So, you can put an artificial
material, so it's made of a

00:02:59.374 --> 00:03:03.504
polymer, inside the eye.
It can stay there for the rest

00:03:03.504 --> 00:03:07.581
of their lives restoring their
vision to near normal and

00:03:07.581 --> 00:03:10.770
requiring no other effort on
their part.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.335
They don't have to put in the
contact lens everyday,

00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:15.900
because it's there inside their
eye all the time.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.970
What kinds of materials are
these that we can use now to

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.349
replace or restore the function
of tissues that are damaged?

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.151
Well, many of the materials
that are used,

00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:34.088
most commonly,
and with the most success now

00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:37.540
are polymers or plastics.
We've talked about some

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.120
different aspects of polymers
and medicine throughout the

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.678
course here.
What I wanted to show you on

00:03:43.678 --> 00:03:47.046
this slide is--and again not
that you would memorize or even

00:03:47.046 --> 00:03:49.330
be able to read all the details
here,

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.081
but there are a large number of
different synthetic materials

00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:56.207
that now are produced and
regularly used in medical

00:03:56.207 --> 00:03:59.080
applications.
Polymers,

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.650
as you know,
are manufactured products.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.451
Most of them are made from
products that are derived from

00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:14.190
petroleum or oil.
They're organic molecules,

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.138
typically small units that are
polymerized together to form

00:04:18.138 --> 00:04:20.372
long chains.
Because the individual

00:04:20.372 --> 00:04:23.790
molecules in a polymer are long
chains, when you put a bunch of

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.355
them together in a material,
they entangle together and they

00:04:27.355 --> 00:04:29.449
give you a nice material
property.

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.220
You're not falling down to the
ground now because the plastic

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.300
chairs that you're sitting on
are quite strong.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.269
This polymer material that
makes up the base of the chair

00:04:41.269 --> 00:04:46.770
is able to support your weight,
and does it very reliably for a

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.518
long period of time.
You also notice that these

00:04:50.518 --> 00:04:53.970
chairs, if they were made out of
wood they would be very heavy.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.290
These are quite light,
you can pick them up easily.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.846
If they were made out of metal
they would be much heavier,

00:05:00.846 --> 00:05:04.339
they might be stronger but they
would be much heavier.

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:07.825
One of the advantages of
polymer materials is that you

00:05:07.825 --> 00:05:11.902
can make things that have quite
a lot of strength but are still

00:05:11.902 --> 00:05:14.501
fairly light.
That's one of the advantages of

00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:16.474
polymer materials.
You can also change

00:05:16.474 --> 00:05:19.501
properties of the polymers.
That's one of the things that

00:05:19.501 --> 00:05:23.084
engineers have learned how to do
with quite a large degree of

00:05:23.084 --> 00:05:25.949
sophistication over the last 100
years or so.

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.358
You can make many different
kinds of polymers,

00:05:28.358 --> 00:05:31.194
now, that differ in the
chemistry of the monomers that

00:05:31.194 --> 00:05:33.870
are linked together to make
these long chains.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.009
You can, of course,
change the length of the chain.

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.405
You can make materials that are
made up of polymers that have

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.500
very long chains or shorter
chains.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.178
As you could imagine,
that changes properties,

00:05:44.178 --> 00:05:47.749
like the material property of
elasticity that we talked about

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:50.607
a few weeks ago.
We've discovered,

00:05:50.607 --> 00:05:54.020
mainly through a process of
trial and error,

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.990
that many of these materials
are biocompatible.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.484
That is, you can put them in
contact with tissues of the

00:06:01.484 --> 00:06:05.361
body, and the side effects of
implanting that material are not

00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:07.889
severe.
Now, in a few slides I'm going

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:11.670
to tell you more about how the
body responds to biomaterials.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.470
What you'll see is that the
response can be very mild to

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.201
some materials that inert,
and can be quite vigorous to

00:06:19.201 --> 00:06:23.756
materials that aren't so inert.
One needs to select a material

00:06:23.756 --> 00:06:27.887
that's appropriate for the
application that you want to use

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:30.306
it for,
has the right properties for

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:33.047
the application,
and also has the right extent

00:06:33.047 --> 00:06:36.459
of compatibility in the tissue
you want to use it in.

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:39.256
This is just to show you kind
of the range of materials that

00:06:39.256 --> 00:06:42.053
can be used now in some of the
applications in which they're

00:06:42.053 --> 00:06:44.443
used.
We'll talk about that as we go

00:06:44.443 --> 00:06:48.462
through the lecture today.
One of the applications

00:06:48.462 --> 00:06:52.968
I've already talked about last
week was making tubes of

00:06:52.968 --> 00:06:56.065
polymers,
tubes of polymers that can be

00:06:56.065 --> 00:07:00.040
used to replace the conduits
through which blood flow.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.746
This slide shows you some
examples of arterial grafts,

00:07:03.746 --> 00:07:07.731
so synthetic materials that are
used to replace a segment,

00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:11.448
let's say of the aorta.
This might be needed because

00:07:11.448 --> 00:07:15.367
the patient has had some kind of
trauma where their aorta has

00:07:15.367 --> 00:07:18.959
become ruptured like in a car
accident, for example.

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:21.745
It's deep within your body so
it would have to be a pretty

00:07:21.745 --> 00:07:24.139
significant trauma in order to
hurt your aorta.

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:27.496
More commonly,
sometimes there are diseases of

00:07:27.496 --> 00:07:31.972
the aorta where the wall of the
aorta becomes weak and causes

00:07:31.972 --> 00:07:36.298
what's called an aneurism,
or a weak spot in the artery

00:07:36.298 --> 00:07:39.789
that can balloon out.
Obviously, if that becomes so

00:07:39.789 --> 00:07:42.850
weak that it bursts that's a
medical emergency.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.601
If you diagnose those early
enough then you can replace that

00:07:46.601 --> 00:07:49.459
segment of the aorta with a
synthetic polymer.

00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:52.602
This has been done for decades
now, there are several different

00:07:52.602 --> 00:07:54.680
materials that can be used in
this way.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.868
Because the aorta is a large
caliber vessel it stays patent,

00:07:59.868 --> 00:08:04.704
that is the blood can flow
through continuously for many

00:08:04.704 --> 00:08:08.058
decades.
This is true for vessels that

00:08:08.058 --> 00:08:11.069
are larger than say 5 mm in
diameter.

00:08:11.069 --> 00:08:14.182
As the size goes down,
it becomes more difficult to

00:08:14.182 --> 00:08:17.170
use synthetic materials in these
applications.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.082
You can't use a synthetic
material like this in the

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:21.829
coronary arteries,
for example,

00:08:21.829 --> 00:08:24.169
of the heart.
We talked about that several

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:26.462
weeks ago.
I'll show you some pictures

00:08:26.462 --> 00:08:30.574
that show you why that wouldn't
work in smaller diameter vessels

00:08:30.574 --> 00:08:33.504
in a few moments.
Most of the materials that

00:08:33.504 --> 00:08:36.700
are used here were initially
developed for other purposes.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.419
The two most common materials
that are used in conduits like

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:44.764
this are Dacron,
which is a synthetic polymer

00:08:44.764 --> 00:08:48.573
that was first--was used for
lots of things but it's made

00:08:48.573 --> 00:08:51.179
into clothing,
for example.

00:08:51.179 --> 00:08:55.787
Surgeons like it because it has
nice properties,

00:08:55.787 --> 00:08:59.808
you can sew it easily.
Imagine that a material that's

00:08:59.808 --> 00:09:02.254
going to be used in an
application like this,

00:09:02.254 --> 00:09:05.480
a surgeon has to be able to sew
into it fairly readily.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.123
It has to be able to hold a
suture, and that suture line has

00:09:09.123 --> 00:09:12.520
to make a neat connection or
anastomosis with the native

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.986
vessel.
Surgeons being able to sew into

00:09:14.986 --> 00:09:18.213
the material reliably is,
obviously, an important part of

00:09:18.213 --> 00:09:20.328
the design.
Dacron, a textile,

00:09:20.328 --> 00:09:24.357
has a nice property that way.
The other material that's

00:09:24.357 --> 00:09:28.370
used often is a material you're
familiar with called GORE-TEX.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:33.338
GORE-TEX is basically Teflon,
its Teflon that is treated in a

00:09:33.338 --> 00:09:36.320
special so that it becomes
porous.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.009
One of the properties of
Teflon, you use it as cookware,

00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:42.760
for example,
because things don't stick to

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.759
it.
It's not a sticky polymer,

00:09:44.759 --> 00:09:47.818
it's fairly inert to
particularly proteins that might

00:09:47.818 --> 00:09:50.153
stick on the surface.
On it's own,

00:09:50.153 --> 00:09:54.768
it would not be porous and so
it wouldn't allow any molecules

00:09:54.768 --> 00:09:57.761
to pass through.
GORE-TEX, on the other hand,

00:09:57.761 --> 00:10:00.989
is fashioned--and this is a
picture of GORE-TEX at very high

00:10:00.989 --> 00:10:03.779
magnification here,
so it has small pores in it.

00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:08.735
Pores that are so small that a
droplet of water can't pass

00:10:08.735 --> 00:10:12.039
through, but molecules of water
can.

00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:16.538
That's why GORE-TEX is so
useful as a material for hiking

00:10:16.538 --> 00:10:19.911
for rain gear,
it allows water to evaporate

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:24.490
through it but doesn't allow
drops of water to go in.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.303
You can make a waterproof
material that still allows your

00:10:28.303 --> 00:10:32.457
body to sweat and for vapors to
come off your body but doesn't

00:10:32.457 --> 00:10:35.870
allow water to go in.
That same property makes it

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.149
useful for arterial grafts as
well.

00:10:38.149 --> 00:10:41.413
There's some facts on this
slide that show you how many of

00:10:41.413 --> 00:10:45.021
these operations that use these
kinds of materials are performed

00:10:45.021 --> 00:10:47.667
every year.
Another example of using

00:10:47.667 --> 00:10:51.049
synthetic materials like that is
in the heart valve.

00:10:51.049 --> 00:10:54.101
We talked about how heart
valves function several weeks

00:10:54.101 --> 00:10:56.009
ago.
We talked about how your heart

00:10:56.009 --> 00:10:59.096
becomes very inefficient in its
pumping action if the valves

00:10:59.096 --> 00:11:02.770
don't work properly.
There are diseases of valves

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.703
that are not uncommon.
Many people,

00:11:05.703 --> 00:11:08.641
decades ago,
died because--at relatively

00:11:08.641 --> 00:11:13.159
young ages because their heart
valves would stop working.

00:11:13.159 --> 00:11:15.373
Their heart,
even though it was beating

00:11:15.373 --> 00:11:18.809
properly, could not deliver the
flow rate that was needed to

00:11:18.809 --> 00:11:21.253
sustain life.
Here's an early example of a

00:11:21.253 --> 00:11:23.589
mechanical valve,
a totally synthetic material

00:11:23.589 --> 00:11:26.029
that could be used to replace a
heart valve.

00:11:26.029 --> 00:11:29.727
Now, this is a collar here,
which is made of a textile that

00:11:29.727 --> 00:11:33.127
can be sewn into the spot,
to the ring of tissue where the

00:11:33.127 --> 00:11:36.028
heart valve goes.
You can see that white material

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:39.111
there, there's a metal ring
underneath it and on both sides

00:11:39.111 --> 00:11:43.009
of this ring there's a cage,
a small cage on the bottom and

00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:47.001
a larger cage on the top.
The heart would be down here,

00:11:47.001 --> 00:11:50.169
the ventricle would be down
below this here.

00:11:50.169 --> 00:11:55.169
If there was pressure on this
side, it would force the ball

00:11:55.169 --> 00:11:57.374
up.
When the pressure in the left

00:11:57.374 --> 00:12:01.046
ventricle got to be higher than
the aorta, it would force the

00:12:01.046 --> 00:12:04.082
ball up.
Then, flow would go out because

00:12:04.082 --> 00:12:08.121
the ball sitting in this
position completely seals the

00:12:08.121 --> 00:12:10.873
opening.
When the pressure pushes

00:12:10.873 --> 00:12:14.154
the ball up then it opens up a
pathway around it,

00:12:14.154 --> 00:12:18.187
so blood can come out through
the sides and the ball goes up

00:12:18.187 --> 00:12:22.424
but it doesn't go away because
it's constrained by this cage on

00:12:22.424 --> 00:12:25.102
the top.
Now, when the pressure here

00:12:25.102 --> 00:12:28.712
gets higher than the pressure
down here, the ball falls back

00:12:28.712 --> 00:12:31.836
down and it reseals.
So, it does exactly what we

00:12:31.836 --> 00:12:35.269
wanted or what we described the
heart valve is doing,

00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:38.219
that is opening up when the
pressure difference was right,

00:12:38.219 --> 00:12:41.480
when the pressure was higher in
the ventricle then the aorta,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.065
and then closing again when the
pressure in the aorta was higher

00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:48.126
than the ventricle.
Now, the problem with this

00:12:48.126 --> 00:12:51.735
is you remember how the normal
valve opens, it opens like a

00:12:51.735 --> 00:12:54.950
doorway.
The normal valve opens like a

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:59.139
doorway, so the part that's shut
totally opens.

00:12:59.139 --> 00:13:02.490
There's a very clear path for
flow.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:07.009
In this kind of a ball valve,
the ball is still in the way.

00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:10.631
The fluid has to go around the
ball in order to eject into the

00:13:10.631 --> 00:13:13.600
aorta, for example,
if this was an aortic valve.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:19.613
Because it has to go around it,
there's an obstacle to blood

00:13:19.613 --> 00:13:23.690
flow creates an additional
resistance.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:27.163
Your heart has to work harder
in order to overcome the

00:13:27.163 --> 00:13:31.096
resistance of the flow going
around this large ball that's in

00:13:31.096 --> 00:13:33.859
the center.
It works well as a valve

00:13:33.859 --> 00:13:37.673
but it's not a very efficient
valve, in that it requires your

00:13:37.673 --> 00:13:41.296
heart to work more to get a
certain flow rate because it's

00:13:41.296 --> 00:13:45.110
blocking--this ball is blocking
the center of the flow.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.166
In addition,
you can imagine this ball

00:13:47.166 --> 00:13:49.500
slamming up and then slamming
back down.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.158
Up and down,
could cause mechanical damage

00:13:52.158 --> 00:13:55.537
to the blood and it does.
Blood consists not just of

00:13:55.537 --> 00:13:58.729
water and molecules but cells,
like red blood cells,

00:13:58.729 --> 00:14:02.110
and these cells are sensitive
to mechanical forces.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:06.142
Everytime this valve opens and
closes it breaks a certain

00:14:06.142 --> 00:14:10.512
number of blood cells.
That's also something that you

00:14:10.512 --> 00:14:15.450
can live with but isn't perfect.
The most--a better design

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:19.580
was made in, I think about the
1970s, it's this valve that's

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.862
shown here.
In many ways it's similar,

00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:24.568
it has the same kind of a
textile ring and metal on the

00:14:24.568 --> 00:14:26.810
outside.
Now it's shown sort of end-on,

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:30.023
so you're looking through the
valve and what you don't see

00:14:30.023 --> 00:14:32.389
here are two,
what are called leaflets.

00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:35.750
These are made of metal and
they fold like this,

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:39.110
close like this and then they
open like that.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:43.152
It's more like a swinging door
and also responds to pressure

00:14:43.152 --> 00:14:45.550
because it can only open one
way.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.593
It goes like this;
it won't go like that,

00:14:47.593 --> 00:14:50.161
so it only opens in one
direction in response to a

00:14:50.161 --> 00:14:52.940
pressure drop and then it closes
in the other way.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.139
This is now the most commonly
used design for a totally

00:14:57.139 --> 00:15:00.054
synthetic valve.
Still, a popular valve

00:15:00.054 --> 00:15:03.200
that's used are these two valves
that are shown here.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.097
This is one is from a cow,
this one is from a pig,

00:15:06.097 --> 00:15:09.940
and they're natural valves that
are recovered from the animals.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:14.039
Then, they're treated,
they're cross-linked with a

00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:18.139
chemical so that they become
permanent structures,

00:15:18.139 --> 00:15:22.877
non-living structures now.
These sort of bio-synthetic

00:15:22.877 --> 00:15:26.259
valves, what's called in the
caption here,

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:29.347
a bio-prosthesis.
Prosthesis just means

00:15:29.347 --> 00:15:33.181
replacement, so this is derived
from natural tissue is an

00:15:33.181 --> 00:15:35.919
alternative to this mechanical
valve.

00:15:35.919 --> 00:15:39.451
Physicians will use one of
these types of valves or another

00:15:39.451 --> 00:15:42.740
depending on which of your
valves needs replacement,

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.519
what their own experience is
with people that have diseases

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:50.409
like the ones they're treating.
There are at least several

00:15:50.409 --> 00:15:53.895
options available.
One of the problems when

00:15:53.895 --> 00:15:58.802
you put any synthetic material,
or any material other than your

00:15:58.802 --> 00:16:02.458
own tissues,
in contact with blood is that

00:16:02.458 --> 00:16:07.820
you will start a process called
coagulation or blood clotting.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:13.879
Of course, this natural
reaction is important to our

00:16:13.879 --> 00:16:16.764
lives.
If you damage a blood vessel,

00:16:16.764 --> 00:16:19.100
the blood vessel becomes
ruptured.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.450
All of a sudden,
the blood is exposed to a

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:25.822
surface it's not used to seeing.
You damage a blood vessel and

00:16:25.822 --> 00:16:30.667
instead of the blood flowing
through a nice tube that has a

00:16:30.667 --> 00:16:34.259
very consistent endothelial cell
lining,

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:38.232
it's now exposed to the tissue
outside when the blood vessel

00:16:38.232 --> 00:16:41.651
gets ruptured.
When it's exposed to the tissue

00:16:41.651 --> 00:16:45.879
outside, a series of chemical
reactions gets initiated.

00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:49.227
That series of chemical
reactions is called the

00:16:49.227 --> 00:16:52.739
coagulation cascade.
It involves proteins that are

00:16:52.739 --> 00:16:56.607
also enzymes that go from an
inactive state to an active

00:16:56.607 --> 00:16:59.128
state.
This is described in the book

00:16:59.128 --> 00:17:01.282
in some detail.
I'm not going to ask you

00:17:01.282 --> 00:17:03.460
questions about the molecular
details of this.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.893
I want you to just sort of
understand the concept,

00:17:06.893 --> 00:17:10.958
that a protein in the blood
gets activated by exposure to a

00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:14.714
foreign surface.
It creates an activated enzyme,

00:17:14.714 --> 00:17:19.197
which then activates another
enzyme, which activates another

00:17:19.197 --> 00:17:24.400
enzyme on through this network.
The final result is that a

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.532
molecule in your blood,
called fibrinogen,

00:17:28.532 --> 00:17:33.470
it's converted in to a
cross-linked network called

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.768
fibrin.
Exposure to a foreign surface

00:17:36.768 --> 00:17:39.720
sets off a series of chemical
reactions.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.087
The end result is that a
natural protein in your blood

00:17:43.087 --> 00:17:46.646
that's normally dissolved and
just flowing around in your

00:17:46.646 --> 00:17:50.077
blood called fibrinogen gets
cross-linked into a gel or

00:17:50.077 --> 00:17:55.089
semi-solid material.
This is the formation of a clot.

00:17:55.089 --> 00:17:58.725
Now, when this reaction
happens, this cross-linking of

00:17:58.725 --> 00:18:02.574
fibrinogen into fibrin happens,
they're usually cells that are

00:18:02.574 --> 00:18:05.947
trapped there as well because
these cross-linking reactions

00:18:05.947 --> 00:18:09.552
occur in blood and there's lots
of blood that gets cross-linked

00:18:09.552 --> 00:18:12.709
into this network.
You form a semi-solid

00:18:12.709 --> 00:18:18.080
structural material that seals
off the area of the blood vessel

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.985
that's damaged.
Blood now stays within your

00:18:21.985 --> 00:18:25.460
circulatory system,
the bleeding stops.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:30.549
That seal that gets made is a
chemically cross-linked version

00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:34.026
of fibronectin,
and you know it as a blood

00:18:34.026 --> 00:18:35.588
clot.
You cut yourself,

00:18:35.588 --> 00:18:37.986
you see a clot later,
it looks red because--it looks

00:18:37.986 --> 00:18:40.312
red but it's solid.
It looks red because there's

00:18:40.312 --> 00:18:42.990
blood cells trapped in it,
red blood cells trapped in it.

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:47.003
It's solid because the basis of
it is this cross-linked network

00:18:47.003 --> 00:18:50.172
of proteins.
This happens if you expose

00:18:50.172 --> 00:18:53.235
blood;
anytime you expose blood to a

00:18:53.235 --> 00:18:57.222
foreign material.
It happens if you put a heart

00:18:57.222 --> 00:19:01.630
valve, an artificial heart valve
in the blood pathway,

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:05.539
this clotting reaction will
start to happen.

00:19:05.539 --> 00:19:07.240
That's what's shown in this
slide here.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.856
You can't see it too well but
this surface would ordinarily

00:19:10.856 --> 00:19:13.600
look smooth.
It doesn't look smooth because

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.779
there are proteins coagulated on
the surface here.

00:19:16.779 --> 00:19:20.158
These proteins of fibronectin
that are being converted into a

00:19:20.158 --> 00:19:23.029
fibrin gel.
There are also specialized

00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:26.485
cells that also find these
fibrin networks,

00:19:26.485 --> 00:19:30.269
and they spread out to help
form a barrier.

00:19:30.269 --> 00:19:32.519
These cells are called
platelets, and you know

00:19:32.519 --> 00:19:35.470
platelets are also important in
blood clotting reactions.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:39.106
One of the problems with
every synthetic material that's

00:19:39.106 --> 00:19:42.619
used to replace a component of
your circulatory system,

00:19:42.619 --> 00:19:47.281
like a heart valve,
is that you form a thin layer

00:19:47.281 --> 00:19:51.732
of clot on the surface.
Now, what you hope is that that

00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:55.647
happens within the first few
hours of when the heart valve is

00:19:55.647 --> 00:19:58.396
replaced.
Then doesn't happen anymore

00:19:58.396 --> 00:20:02.694
because it becomes a sort of
natural biological surface now,

00:20:02.694 --> 00:20:08.360
and your body tolerates it.
It requires--this only happens

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:13.964
with certain kinds of materials.
That's one of the criteria for

00:20:13.964 --> 00:20:16.980
selecting materials that are
used as heart valves,

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:22.356
is that they have to be able to
support sort of a mild clotting

00:20:22.356 --> 00:20:24.969
reaction;
a mild, not a severe,

00:20:24.969 --> 00:20:28.495
clotting reaction.
What happens if this clot

00:20:28.495 --> 00:20:32.319
keeps forming on the surface?
The clot gets thicker and

00:20:32.319 --> 00:20:36.261
thicker on the surface and
eventually, since there's blood

00:20:36.261 --> 00:20:39.567
flowing by,
pieces of that clot could be

00:20:39.567 --> 00:20:44.660
expelled from--or detached from
the surface of the material.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:48.388
They would flow into your blood.
If they flowed up into your

00:20:48.388 --> 00:20:51.249
brain, for example,
they could clog smaller

00:20:51.249 --> 00:20:55.062
arteries inside your brain and
cut off blood flow to that

00:20:55.062 --> 00:20:58.450
region.
That process is called embolism.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:02.300
Embolism is when a small
particle is released into your

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:06.294
bloodstream, and embolism can
cause all sorts of unwanted

00:21:06.294 --> 00:21:09.680
effects.
So, a bad heart valve might

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:15.071
give you a stroke in the brain.
This is one kind of

00:21:15.071 --> 00:21:19.172
reaction to a biomaterial.
These other two pictures show

00:21:19.172 --> 00:21:22.089
you other kinds of reactions.
Here's a material labeled as M

00:21:22.089 --> 00:21:24.089
here that's implanted under the
skin.

00:21:24.089 --> 00:21:28.294
What you see is that after time
this unusual layer of tissue

00:21:28.294 --> 00:21:32.569
forms, this is called a part of
the foreign body reaction.

00:21:32.569 --> 00:21:35.660
Your body tries to form a kind
of scar around the material.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:39.000
I'll show you how that happens
in a cartoon in just a minute.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.685
Materials that are very--that
are not so inert can cause

00:21:43.685 --> 00:21:48.286
extensive cellular reactions
like the one I show on the

00:21:48.286 --> 00:21:52.371
bottom here.
These dots here are cells from

00:21:52.371 --> 00:21:55.984
your inflammatory system.
They're neutrophils and

00:21:55.984 --> 00:21:59.095
macrophages that are collecting
at the site of the foreign

00:21:59.095 --> 00:22:01.406
material.
The material here was a mesh

00:22:01.406 --> 00:22:04.247
and you can see where the fibers
of the mesh are,

00:22:04.247 --> 00:22:08.266
where there's clear dots here.
You can see there lots of cells

00:22:08.266 --> 00:22:10.978
that are recruited.
If you showed this to an

00:22:10.978 --> 00:22:14.654
experienced pathologist he would
say these cells are coming in as

00:22:14.654 --> 00:22:16.779
part of the inflammatory
response,

00:22:16.779 --> 00:22:23.470
as part of the unwanted
response to this material.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.599
Every material produces a
different reaction when you put

00:22:26.599 --> 00:22:28.860
it into the body.
The details of the reaction

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.401
depend on the chemistry of the
material, its mechanical

00:22:31.401 --> 00:22:33.545
properties,
how its surface is treated,

00:22:33.545 --> 00:22:35.470
if the surface is rough or
smooth.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:38.492
From an engineering
perspective, those are all

00:22:38.492 --> 00:22:41.180
things that we can potentially
change.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.249
We can design materials
hopefully that minimize the

00:22:44.249 --> 00:22:48.073
response of the body to it.
In general, you can't make the

00:22:48.073 --> 00:22:51.069
response go away,
and the response appears to

00:22:51.069 --> 00:22:53.589
have some general
characteristics.

00:22:53.589 --> 00:22:57.049
There's general ways that your
body responds to all materials

00:22:57.049 --> 00:22:59.990
and those general ways are shown
in this cartoon.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:04.684
In the first few minutes,
seconds, or up to an hour,

00:23:04.684 --> 00:23:09.720
when you put a material into
the body it becomes coated with

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.653
proteins.
Now, where do these proteins

00:23:12.653 --> 00:23:15.218
come from?
If this was a material that we

00:23:15.218 --> 00:23:18.792
used in the--in contact with
blood, those proteins probably

00:23:18.792 --> 00:23:21.434
came from the blood.
If this was a heart valve,

00:23:21.434 --> 00:23:23.317
for example,
then these proteins probably

00:23:23.317 --> 00:23:26.393
came from the blood.
If you looked at the proteins,

00:23:26.393 --> 00:23:29.649
they'd be primarily the
abundant proteins that are

00:23:29.649 --> 00:23:33.569
naturally abundant in blood like
albumin and fibrinogen,

00:23:33.569 --> 00:23:35.349
other kinds of proteins like
that.

00:23:35.349 --> 00:23:38.890
Protein absorption happens very
quickly.

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:44.421
Within the next few days
cells will start to accumulate

00:23:44.421 --> 00:23:48.993
around the material.
It appears that--what we know

00:23:48.993 --> 00:23:53.941
now suggests that these cells
are recruited to the material

00:23:53.941 --> 00:23:57.779
because of the proteins that are
absorbed.

00:23:57.779 --> 00:24:02.232
You can understand that--you
know that proteins are--surround

00:24:02.232 --> 00:24:06.002
all the cells in our body.
We talked about extracellular

00:24:06.002 --> 00:24:09.096
matrix and how there are
concentrated gels or proteins

00:24:09.096 --> 00:24:13.990
that surround almost every cell.
Cells like to stick to protein

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:16.567
layers.
If you have a material that's

00:24:16.567 --> 00:24:19.450
coated with a protein cells will
stick to it.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.984
Now, the first cells that
arrive and that stick are cells

00:24:22.984 --> 00:24:27.595
of the inflammatory response.
In the inflammatory responses,

00:24:27.595 --> 00:24:32.237
the natural process of your
body responding to some

00:24:32.237 --> 00:24:37.213
potentially harmful event,
these cells are moving around

00:24:37.213 --> 00:24:40.414
in your body all the time.
They flow through your

00:24:40.414 --> 00:24:42.685
bloodstream;
they crawl through your

00:24:42.685 --> 00:24:46.668
tissues, they're looking for
something potentially bad to

00:24:46.668 --> 00:24:48.501
happen.
Then when it does,

00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:50.930
they try to start the healing
process.

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:53.750
These cells recognize that
proteins are attached to the

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:56.779
material and they begin to
accumulate at this site here.

00:24:56.779 --> 00:25:00.883
The first cells that arrive are
neutrophils, the second set are

00:25:00.883 --> 00:25:03.248
macrophages.
Now, those are the cells

00:25:03.248 --> 00:25:06.176
that I show accumulating at high
concentration around this

00:25:06.176 --> 00:25:08.941
material here.
What they do is they start the

00:25:08.941 --> 00:25:12.410
healing process and they do that
in a variety of ways.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:17.191
One is that they release
enzymes that try to digest

00:25:17.191 --> 00:25:21.101
whatever is around.
They also send out signals to

00:25:21.101 --> 00:25:23.789
recruit other kinds of cells to
come in.

00:25:23.789 --> 00:25:27.741
That's what's shown in this
second stage here,

00:25:27.741 --> 00:25:31.430
is that the cells condense into
a layer.

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:35.640
They form what are called giant
cells, which are basically

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.630
macrophages that fuse together
to form a giant cell,

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:43.639
which in some circumstances can
completely encapsulate this

00:25:43.639 --> 00:25:46.183
material.
They send out signals to the

00:25:46.183 --> 00:25:49.750
rest of your body that say,
'Something's going on here,

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:55.189
we need your help in healing
whatever is happening at this

00:25:55.189 --> 00:25:58.654
local site.
' If this was a splinter,

00:25:58.654 --> 00:26:01.723
for example,
that you got underneath your

00:26:01.723 --> 00:26:06.480
skin your body's response to it
would be to form a scar all the

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.779
way around it and to try to
digest it.

00:26:09.779 --> 00:26:13.408
If you've ever had a splinter
that you couldn't get out you

00:26:13.408 --> 00:26:16.599
might have waited for a few
days, or a few weeks.

00:26:16.599 --> 00:26:19.853
Eventually, the splinter gets
covered with some kind of a

00:26:19.853 --> 00:26:22.991
tissue and it comes up towards
the top of your skin and

00:26:22.991 --> 00:26:25.490
eventually gets ejected from
your body.

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:29.319
That's one kind of a healing
response that's natural.

00:26:29.319 --> 00:26:32.914
If that splinter was too deep
it would just get totally

00:26:32.914 --> 00:26:35.710
covered with a scar,
scar all around it.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:40.036
The cells that are in the scar
tissue would be secreting

00:26:40.036 --> 00:26:44.757
enzymes and digestive chemicals
inside trying to dissolve the

00:26:44.757 --> 00:26:46.996
splinter.
If it was made of wood,

00:26:46.996 --> 00:26:49.692
eventually it would dissolve
and it would completely

00:26:49.692 --> 00:26:52.453
disappear.
If it's made of a synthetic

00:26:52.453 --> 00:26:56.532
polymer that doesn't respond--or
doesn't get digested by those

00:26:56.532 --> 00:27:00.612
chemicals what happens is that a
stable scar forms around this

00:27:00.612 --> 00:27:05.134
material that never disappears,
but the material is isolated

00:27:05.134 --> 00:27:09.528
now from the rest of your body.
Now, I mentioned that different

00:27:09.528 --> 00:27:13.230
materials produce different
levels of response like this.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:17.555
Some of the responses are very
mild in that you get very little

00:27:17.555 --> 00:27:20.276
protein absorbed,
you get very few cells

00:27:20.276 --> 00:27:23.795
recruited to the site.
You'd get, not a scar,

00:27:23.795 --> 00:27:28.134
but maybe a thin layer of
cellular tissue that would form

00:27:28.134 --> 00:27:31.701
around the outside.
Some responses are mild and

00:27:31.701 --> 00:27:34.044
those are considered
biocompatible,

00:27:34.044 --> 00:27:38.180
and some are more vigorous and
those are considered to be not

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:41.681
so compatible.
It happens with almost every

00:27:41.681 --> 00:27:44.266
material we know.
Let's talk for a few

00:27:44.266 --> 00:27:47.109
minutes about a completely
different kind of application.

00:27:47.109 --> 00:27:50.034
Again, this one that I
mentioned a few weeks ago when

00:27:50.034 --> 00:27:51.946
we were talking about
biomechanics,

00:27:51.946 --> 00:27:54.140
and that is replacement of the
hip.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:58.960
I just showed you this drawing
here to remind of hip anatomy.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.112
The pelvic bone is here,
which form a girdle at the

00:28:02.112 --> 00:28:06.579
level of your waist.
There's a cup inside the pelvic

00:28:06.579 --> 00:28:11.937
girdle called the acetabulum.
Into that cup the head of femur

00:28:11.937 --> 00:28:16.540
fits in a ball-and-socket joint,
so that your hip has all the

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:21.372
range of movement that we talked
about in class and in section a

00:28:21.372 --> 00:28:24.967
few weeks ago.
If there's a disease of this

00:28:24.967 --> 00:28:28.859
bone and this needs to be
replaced, then the general

00:28:28.859 --> 00:28:33.591
procedure now is to replace not
only the part--this part of the

00:28:33.591 --> 00:28:39.116
hip that contains the joint,
the ball, but also to replace

00:28:39.116 --> 00:28:42.679
the socket as well.
So, you create a total hip

00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:46.117
replacement where you've got a
material that you put into the

00:28:46.117 --> 00:28:48.854
socket,
and a material that you put

00:28:48.854 --> 00:28:52.059
onto the femur to fit into that
socket.

00:28:52.059 --> 00:28:57.177
I showed you this picture
before and this was a--this is a

00:28:57.177 --> 00:29:02.378
design of a material like this,
you see a metal cup that serves

00:29:02.378 --> 00:29:06.819
as the new acetabulum.
You see a metal ball that is

00:29:06.819 --> 00:29:10.853
attached to the femur,
and this ball fits into this

00:29:10.853 --> 00:29:13.581
socket.
Now, if you just had metal on

00:29:13.581 --> 00:29:17.688
metal and you tried to move that
metal ball inside that socket,

00:29:17.688 --> 00:29:20.448
that doesn't work so well.
Metal on metal,

00:29:20.448 --> 00:29:22.740
there's some friction between
these two.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.505
If this was a motor and you had
metal on metal,

00:29:25.505 --> 00:29:28.269
you'd put oil in between there
to lubricate.

00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:33.470
This is not possible in this
situation.

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:37.431
You put something else in there
to lubricate and the something

00:29:37.431 --> 00:29:41.017
else is this white material.
It's a layer of polymer,

00:29:41.017 --> 00:29:44.086
a thin layer of polymer that
also forms a cup,

00:29:44.086 --> 00:29:47.019
fits exactly into this
acetabulum piece.

00:29:47.019 --> 00:29:52.189
The ball of the femur,
then, is gliding on this smooth

00:29:52.189 --> 00:29:55.960
polymer piece.
These polymer pieces have been

00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:00.160
made of a variety of different
materials over the years,

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.533
Teflon, and now most of the
pieces now are made of high

00:30:03.533 --> 00:30:07.410
density polyethylene.
Bobby?Student:

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:12.877
[inaudible]Professor Mark
Saltzman: Modern hip

00:30:12.877 --> 00:30:16.150
replacements,
and I'll show you some new

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:20.230
designs, now typically have a
lifetime of closer to 20 years.

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:25.260
I'll tell you why many of them
have to be replaced after about

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.230
10 years, the older designed
ones.

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:31.750
Design has gotten better over
time with these,

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:36.680
and I'll talk about some of the
ways that it's gotten better.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.709
One of the problems is that
this piece here,

00:30:39.709 --> 00:30:42.803
this ball of the femur,
this part that's going to

00:30:42.803 --> 00:30:46.671
replace the hip has to be very
firmly attached to the rest of

00:30:46.671 --> 00:30:49.830
your--to the rest of the bones
of your leg,

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:52.963
to your femur.
If you're standing on one leg,

00:30:52.963 --> 00:30:56.855
all the weight of your body is
really being carried by this

00:30:56.855 --> 00:31:00.317
piece of material here.
That's why they're made out of

00:31:00.317 --> 00:31:03.293
metal because metals are strong
and relatively light,

00:31:03.293 --> 00:31:07.254
and you need a strong material.
Plastic wouldn't work in this

00:31:07.254 --> 00:31:09.973
setting.
Plastic wouldn't work in this

00:31:09.973 --> 00:31:12.859
setting because plastic is too
elastic.

00:31:12.859 --> 00:31:19.125
Most plastics are too elastic,
whereas metal is stiffer and

00:31:19.125 --> 00:31:23.642
can hold your weight.
What you didn't see in that

00:31:23.642 --> 00:31:27.838
previous picture is that there's
a long piece here that goes down

00:31:27.838 --> 00:31:31.510
into the bone and this long
piece that goes into the bone

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:35.247
allows you to fix the ball of
the femur to the rest of the

00:31:35.247 --> 00:31:38.411
femur.
It's fixed because this metal

00:31:38.411 --> 00:31:42.637
part down here goes down into
the shaft of your femur,

00:31:42.637 --> 00:31:46.749
and then is held there.
It's kind of like a long,

00:31:46.749 --> 00:31:51.724
thick nail that goes down into
the length of the bone and what

00:31:51.724 --> 00:31:56.210
you hope is that that large
surface area in contact,

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:59.731
metal to bone,
holds the whole piece into

00:31:59.731 --> 00:32:03.430
place so that the hip operates
smoothly.

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:08.947
Now, one of the goals of
this would be to create a design

00:32:08.947 --> 00:32:13.269
that naturally integrates into
your bone and,

00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:16.920
what's called on this,
a 'self-locking mechanism'.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.980
What would a self-locking
mechanism be like?

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:23.024
Well, maybe you'd put holes in
this material like the holes

00:32:23.024 --> 00:32:26.720
shown here so that your bone
could grow through it.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:31.189
As your bone heals around this
implant what if bone could grow

00:32:31.189 --> 00:32:34.705
though the material,
then you'd have bone on both

00:32:34.705 --> 00:32:38.755
sides sort of locking it in.
That would be the perfect

00:32:38.755 --> 00:32:42.576
design, that would be a--not
perfect, but that would be a

00:32:42.576 --> 00:32:46.267
good design.
The problem is that's going to

00:32:46.267 --> 00:32:49.382
take some time.
You want the person to be

00:32:49.382 --> 00:32:51.832
able to stand up and walk,
and move around,

00:32:51.832 --> 00:32:54.750
and function in the period
before that happens.

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:59.307
What is usually done is that
another material is used to lock

00:32:59.307 --> 00:33:02.269
these materials temporarily in
place.

00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:05.160
That material is called bone
cement;

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:10.072
it's a polymer that can be
polymerized when you shine light

00:33:10.072 --> 00:33:12.786
on it.
It's not too dissimilar from

00:33:12.786 --> 00:33:16.859
the materials that's dentists
use now to fill cavities.

00:33:16.859 --> 00:33:20.885
If you had a cavity filled
recently they put some sort of a

00:33:20.885 --> 00:33:25.119
material into the cavity and
then they shine a light on it.

00:33:25.119 --> 00:33:27.734
They put on the goggles and
they cover up your face and they

00:33:27.734 --> 00:33:30.551
shine a light on it.
The polymer that they put into

00:33:30.551 --> 00:33:33.559
the cavity polymerizes and forms
a hard surface.

00:33:33.559 --> 00:33:37.900
Here, they put the polymer all
around the acetabular cup,

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:42.472
they put the polymer into the
recess that they push the bone

00:33:42.472 --> 00:33:45.385
into.
Then, they shine light on it so

00:33:45.385 --> 00:33:49.388
that it starts to--so that it
polymerizes and hardens and

00:33:49.388 --> 00:33:53.819
forms a very tough material that
fixes this thing in place.

00:33:53.819 --> 00:33:57.563
That's called bone cement and
the material is

00:33:57.563 --> 00:34:02.359
polymethylmethacrylate.
You can see that this now

00:34:02.359 --> 00:34:07.329
involves at least three
different kinds of materials.

00:34:07.329 --> 00:34:09.574
There's the metal that's used
to make the implant,

00:34:09.574 --> 00:34:12.048
there's the polymer lining
that's used to lubricate the

00:34:12.048 --> 00:34:15.406
joint between the two metals,
and there's the other kind of

00:34:15.406 --> 00:34:19.354
polymer, the cement that's used
to fix this in place in the--in

00:34:19.354 --> 00:34:22.809
contact with your natural bone.
Here's an implant that was

00:34:22.809 --> 00:34:25.289
removed from a patient after,
as Bobby mentioned,

00:34:25.289 --> 00:34:28.124
after maybe 10 years they found
out that their hip wasn't

00:34:28.124 --> 00:34:31.212
working so well anymore.
They were starting to get pain

00:34:31.212 --> 00:34:34.698
from their hip joint or they
weren't able to move it through

00:34:34.698 --> 00:34:38.184
the whole range of motion that
they had been able to move it

00:34:38.184 --> 00:34:42.079
through in years past.
In this particular case,

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:45.530
this joint was removed.
Here's the ball,

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:50.620
here's the acetabular cup,
there's no polymer anymore.

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:54.684
Where did the polymer go?
One of the problems with older

00:34:54.684 --> 00:34:58.101
designs of these materials,
particularly when they use

00:34:58.101 --> 00:35:02.698
Teflon and not polyethylene,
is that over time as you used

00:35:02.698 --> 00:35:06.372
your hip while,
there wasn't much friction

00:35:06.372 --> 00:35:11.570
between the metal ball and the
poly--or the Teflon cup,

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:16.400
there was enough friction where
the Teflon would start to wear.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.289
It would start to wear down and
it would get thinner and thinner

00:35:19.289 --> 00:35:21.683
over time.
Eventually, as in this case

00:35:21.683 --> 00:35:25.440
with this particular patient,
could totally disappear.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.986
If it disappeared then you've
got metal on metal now,

00:35:28.986 --> 00:35:32.661
harder to move your hip,
probably causing pain when you

00:35:32.661 --> 00:35:36.083
move it as well because the
pieces aren't lubricated as

00:35:36.083 --> 00:35:37.733
well.
In addition,

00:35:37.733 --> 00:35:41.809
what happens is that when this
metal is moving against the

00:35:41.809 --> 00:35:45.598
polymer, it wears down but the
polymer doesn't vanish,

00:35:45.598 --> 00:35:49.686
it has to go somewhere.
What most people think is

00:35:49.686 --> 00:35:54.025
happening is that tiny particles
of the Teflon or the

00:35:54.025 --> 00:35:57.530
polyethylene are being created
locally.

00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:59.770
As wear happens,
you're wearing down the

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:03.275
material, you're creating many
small particles of the material

00:36:03.275 --> 00:36:06.266
that are released.
Those particles,

00:36:06.266 --> 00:36:10.800
then, can start an inflammatory
response.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.309
Your body will start to respond
to these small particles.

00:36:14.309 --> 00:36:17.770
That can also cause local
inflammation,

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:22.869
can cause reactions of tissue
which also lead to pain.

00:36:22.869 --> 00:36:27.699
This is one of the biggest
problems in design of hips.

00:36:27.699 --> 00:36:30.428
One of the reasons they've
gotten better is that people

00:36:30.428 --> 00:36:33.345
have gotten better about making
materials that resist this kind

00:36:33.345 --> 00:36:35.638
of wear.
That's why they last for 20

00:36:35.638 --> 00:36:39.159
years now instead of 10 years as
they did in the past.

00:36:39.159 --> 00:36:42.583
There are newer kinds of
materials that people are

00:36:42.583 --> 00:36:45.707
beginning to create.
They're new in a variety of

00:36:45.707 --> 00:36:47.839
ways.
One of the ways they're new is

00:36:47.839 --> 00:36:51.159
that they don't require as much
bone cement any longer.

00:36:51.159 --> 00:36:54.758
This acetabular cup for
example, is made of a ceramic

00:36:54.758 --> 00:36:58.842
which is very porous and which
sticks to bone more naturally

00:36:58.842 --> 00:37:02.510
and more easily than the old
metal cups used too.

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:05.762
Another difference in this
design, is instead of having a

00:37:05.762 --> 00:37:08.959
metal head which moves against
the--a metal ball which moves

00:37:08.959 --> 00:37:14.329
against the polymer socket,
this one has a ceramic head.

00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:18.925
The friction between ceramic
and a polymer is even less then

00:37:18.925 --> 00:37:22.429
the friction between a metal and
a polymer.

00:37:22.429 --> 00:37:25.390
These are also much lighter,
ceramics are lighter,

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:28.739
they're very strong.
You can create a joint that

00:37:28.739 --> 00:37:32.030
lasts even longer with materials
like this.

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:36.394
Engineers are continuously
making improvements in the

00:37:36.394 --> 00:37:39.920
materials that go into joints
like this.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:44.671
They're making improvements in
the design to make them easier

00:37:44.671 --> 00:37:49.073
for surgeons to implant.
Now, a total hip replacement,

00:37:49.073 --> 00:37:53.840
putting these pieces into a
patient takes only about an hour

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:58.346
in the operating room,
which is remarkable given the

00:37:58.346 --> 00:38:02.119
amount that has to happen during
that time.

00:38:02.119 --> 00:38:05.351
I want to quickly review
some other kinds of artificial

00:38:05.351 --> 00:38:07.342
materials.
I'm going to talk for just a

00:38:07.342 --> 00:38:09.800
minute about something that we
talked about before;

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:14.183
dialysis for kidney failure.
It's an example of what's

00:38:14.183 --> 00:38:17.878
called an extracorporeal blood
treatment, meaning that

00:38:17.878 --> 00:38:21.772
blood--'extra' means outside,
'corporeal' means body,

00:38:21.772 --> 00:38:24.519
'extracorporeal' is outside the
body.

00:38:24.519 --> 00:38:27.888
You take the blood outside of
the patient, you pass it through

00:38:27.888 --> 00:38:31.257
a device, the treatment device,
and then it goes back into the

00:38:31.257 --> 00:38:34.449
patient.
You know, you saw in section

00:38:34.449 --> 00:38:39.291
what a Dialyzer unit looks like.
It's an example of a treatment

00:38:39.291 --> 00:38:42.579
where blood is passed through
some kind of a device,

00:38:42.579 --> 00:38:45.099
something happens to the blood,
something good happens,

00:38:45.099 --> 00:38:47.340
and then the blood is returned
to the patient.

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:50.867
A Dialyzer might look like
this, there's blood that comes

00:38:50.867 --> 00:38:53.689
into a chamber and that blood
flows through many,

00:38:53.689 --> 00:38:57.195
many different hollow fibers.
So, blood flowing through these

00:38:57.195 --> 00:38:59.155
fibers.
On the outside of the fibers

00:38:59.155 --> 00:39:02.210
you're flowing a second solution
called the dialysate.

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:06.326
Molecules, waste molecules like
urea which are inside the blood

00:39:06.326 --> 00:39:10.510
capillaries diffuse out into the
dialysate, they're removed from

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:13.233
the blood.
Blood with a high concentration

00:39:13.233 --> 00:39:16.589
of urea comes in this side,
blood with lower urea comes out

00:39:16.589 --> 00:39:19.019
this side and goes back to the
patient.

00:39:19.019 --> 00:39:23.142
That urea is removed by the
dialysate that goes around the

00:39:23.142 --> 00:39:25.762
hollow fibers.
Well, what if you changed

00:39:25.762 --> 00:39:28.840
this design slightly and asked
it to do something different?

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.899
Instead of just flowing in a
solution of saline or a balanced

00:39:32.899 --> 00:39:37.230
salt solution that was designed
to pull urea out of the blood,

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:42.153
what if you put cells in the
area around these hollows

00:39:42.153 --> 00:39:44.289
fibers?
What if you put cells in?

00:39:44.289 --> 00:39:47.383
What if they were cells from
the pancreas,

00:39:47.383 --> 00:39:50.278
for example?
Now, blood is flowing through

00:39:50.278 --> 00:39:52.559
this hollow fiber just like
before.

00:39:52.559 --> 00:39:56.710
On the outside there's not just
a solution of salt,

00:39:56.710 --> 00:40:00.030
but there are cells from the
pancreas.

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:03.057
What if this membrane worked
the same way it does in

00:40:03.057 --> 00:40:05.091
dialysis?
It allows for small molecule

00:40:05.091 --> 00:40:08.896
weight molecules to go through.
Then, if blood came in and it

00:40:08.896 --> 00:40:12.273
had sugar in it,
that sugar would diffuse out

00:40:12.273 --> 00:40:17.110
into the fluid in the shell,
what we used to call dialysate.

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:20.167
If blood sugar is high and
these are cells from the

00:40:20.167 --> 00:40:23.564
pancreas, what do cells of the
pancreas do when they see high

00:40:23.564 --> 00:40:27.260
concentrations of blood sugar?
They secrete insulin.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:31.453
That insulin would be secreted
and it would flow back through

00:40:31.453 --> 00:40:35.748
the tube into the blood.
You could make potentially an

00:40:35.748 --> 00:40:40.620
artificial pancreas this way,
that was used to treat blood

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:44.001
outside the body.
A diabetic patient,

00:40:44.001 --> 00:40:48.050
blood comes out,
it goes through this device.

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:50.928
Glucose would stimulate the
cells to secrete insulin,

00:40:50.928 --> 00:40:54.360
the insulin would go back into
the blood, and the insulin would

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.752
be returned to the body.
If these pancreas cells worked

00:40:57.752 --> 00:41:01.130
properly, they would respond
just like a normal pancreas

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:03.779
does: when sugar goes up,
insulin goes up,

00:41:03.779 --> 00:41:05.869
sugar goes down,
insulin goes down.

00:41:05.869 --> 00:41:09.674
It does that automatically
because the cells are responding

00:41:09.674 --> 00:41:12.543
to the glucose.
That would be very

00:41:12.543 --> 00:41:15.204
inconvenient;
it might be a good solution but

00:41:15.204 --> 00:41:17.944
it would be inconvenient if
you're--had diabetes and you

00:41:17.944 --> 00:41:21.033
needed this all the time to be
taking the blood out of the body

00:41:21.033 --> 00:41:24.121
and you'd have this device that
you'd have to carry around with

00:41:24.121 --> 00:41:26.247
you.
What if you made it so you

00:41:26.247 --> 00:41:29.280
could implant it totally inside
the body as well?

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:34.539
That's what this diagram shows
here.

00:41:34.539 --> 00:41:40.609
Here's an example of that
dialysis unit that is--dialysis

00:41:40.609 --> 00:41:45.269
like unit but it's made to be
very small.

00:41:45.269 --> 00:41:48.292
You can see the shell,
the outside shell here is a

00:41:48.292 --> 00:41:51.992
clear plastic.
It's about the size of--smaller

00:41:51.992 --> 00:41:57.329
than a hockey puck but not a lot
smaller than a hockey puck.

00:41:57.329 --> 00:41:59.949
There's a tube that comes
in that brings blood in,

00:41:59.949 --> 00:42:02.570
there's a tube that comes out
and brings blood out.

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:06.864
This tube goes in and then it
wraps around several times

00:42:06.864 --> 00:42:11.626
inside and then it goes back out
and that wrap--those coils of

00:42:11.626 --> 00:42:16.388
tubing that around inside are
all surrounded by cells from the

00:42:16.388 --> 00:42:19.082
pancreas.
If you hook this up inside the

00:42:19.082 --> 00:42:21.872
body such that you have blood
going in one side and then

00:42:21.872 --> 00:42:24.752
coming out the other,
then you've created a device

00:42:24.752 --> 00:42:27.959
that potentially could treat
diabetes automatically and

00:42:27.959 --> 00:42:31.458
continuously,
as long as the cells were alive

00:42:31.458 --> 00:42:34.577
inside this shell.
This was in the design of

00:42:34.577 --> 00:42:37.070
a--what's called a bio-hybrid
pancreas.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:39.740
It's made of synthetic
materials, the kind of materials

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.570
we've been talking about,
polymers.

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:45.886
It's filled with live cells
that are harvested from a

00:42:45.886 --> 00:42:48.247
pancreas.
Now, because there's a

00:42:48.247 --> 00:42:50.918
material that separates the
cells from your body,

00:42:50.918 --> 00:42:54.035
unlike in tissue engineering
where we wanted the cells to

00:42:54.035 --> 00:42:57.118
integrate into the body,
now there's a material that

00:42:57.118 --> 00:43:00.140
separates the cells.
So, I don't have to use cells

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:03.188
that are immunologically matched
with a patient,

00:43:03.188 --> 00:43:06.189
they're separated.
In fact, I don't even have to

00:43:06.189 --> 00:43:09.140
use human cells.
I could use cells from another

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:13.187
animal, as long as they respond
to sugar and make insulin that

00:43:13.187 --> 00:43:16.438
works in the patient.
So, you might be able to use

00:43:16.438 --> 00:43:19.991
cells from a pig and create an
artificial pancreas that works

00:43:19.991 --> 00:43:23.267
in a person.
These designs were made almost

00:43:23.267 --> 00:43:26.769
20 years ago now and they work
fairly well.

00:43:26.769 --> 00:43:30.860
There are several problems that
still have not been solved.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.909
One is that the cells don't
live forever.

00:43:33.909 --> 00:43:37.563
We know from cell culture the
problem with maintaining cells

00:43:37.563 --> 00:43:40.655
outside the body.
Here, you would like cells that

00:43:40.655 --> 00:43:44.240
last for a very long period of
time and continue to secrete

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:48.318
insulin.
They don't last for long enough

00:43:48.318 --> 00:43:53.909
for this to be an effective
therapy in people yet.

00:43:53.909 --> 00:43:57.480
A device that is similar to
that, the same kind of idea,

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:01.050
is used to treat patients that
have severe liver disease.

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:06.166
Now, you might think about an
implantable device like that,

00:44:06.166 --> 00:44:09.577
but unlike the pancreas,
a device that replaced the

00:44:09.577 --> 00:44:11.599
functions of your liver,
we talked about all the

00:44:11.599 --> 00:44:13.190
different functions of your
liver.

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:16.823
To make an artificial device
like that pancreas that provided

00:44:16.823 --> 00:44:20.820
all the functions of your liver
would need a lot of liver cells,

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:22.369
and it would have to be pretty
big.

00:44:22.369 --> 00:44:25.711
People aren't yet thinking
about an implantable device for

00:44:25.711 --> 00:44:27.448
liver.
What they do use it,

00:44:27.448 --> 00:44:30.809
though, is for--as a device to
support the function of

00:44:30.809 --> 00:44:33.098
patients.
If this a patient who has a

00:44:33.098 --> 00:44:35.169
diseased liver,
they're waiting for a liver

00:44:35.169 --> 00:44:37.814
transplant,
how can you keep them alive

00:44:37.814 --> 00:44:41.868
without a functioning liver,
during the time when they're

00:44:41.868 --> 00:44:44.619
waiting for a transplant to
arrive?

00:44:44.619 --> 00:44:48.370
What some hospitals are now
using are devices in which pig

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:51.726
liver cells are suspended in a
hollow fiber reactor,

00:44:51.726 --> 00:44:55.899
very much like a dialysis unit.
The patient is on something

00:44:55.899 --> 00:44:58.669
like dialysis,
but dialysis that not only

00:44:58.669 --> 00:45:02.728
removes waste products,
dialysis that provides liver

00:45:02.728 --> 00:45:06.357
function as well,
because inside this unit are

00:45:06.357 --> 00:45:11.439
liver cells or hepatocytes that
are performing all the functions

00:45:11.439 --> 00:45:15.230
that liver inside your body
would perform.

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:19.139
This is another example of an
artificial organ.

00:45:19.139 --> 00:45:24.307
An artificial organ that's
used in many thousands of times

00:45:24.307 --> 00:45:28.796
around the country everyday is
this unit here called a

00:45:28.796 --> 00:45:33.539
heart/lung bypass or
cardiopulmonary bypass machine.

00:45:33.539 --> 00:45:38.904
This machine can replace the
function of your lungs and your

00:45:38.904 --> 00:45:43.400
heart during an operation.
If surgeons need to operate on

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:47.170
your heart, they can hook you up
to this machine instead.

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:51.288
They can stop your heart,
your own heart and then this

00:45:51.288 --> 00:45:55.794
machine will take over the
functions of both your heart and

00:45:55.794 --> 00:45:58.190
your lungs.
How does it do that?

00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:01.030
It does that because there's a
pump, a mechanical pump.

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:05.005
There's blood being removed
from the body and from the

00:46:05.005 --> 00:46:08.530
venous side, this is blood that
needs oxygen.

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:12.825
It's being pumped at the normal
cardiac output through a device

00:46:12.825 --> 00:46:17.099
that oxygenates it.
The pumps replace the function

00:46:17.099 --> 00:46:20.209
of your heart;
the oxygenater replaces the

00:46:20.209 --> 00:46:23.208
function of your lungs.
Blood is pumped through the

00:46:23.208 --> 00:46:26.515
oxygenater;
it goes from being oxygen-poor,

00:46:26.515 --> 00:46:30.697
carbon dioxide-rich,
to being carbon dioxide-poor,

00:46:30.697 --> 00:46:34.880
oxygen-rich and then goes back
into your body.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:41.101
You can remain on a pump like
this for several hours while the

00:46:41.101 --> 00:46:45.804
surgeon does a heart transplant,
replaces your heart,

00:46:45.804 --> 00:46:48.519
while the surgeon does a valve
replacement.

00:46:48.519 --> 00:46:51.766
While the surgeon replaces a
coronary artery,

00:46:51.766 --> 00:46:54.869
for example.
This machine can keep your--can

00:46:54.869 --> 00:46:59.210
basically serve as an artificial
heart and lungs during surgery.

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:01.739
Of course,
one of the things that you

00:47:01.739 --> 00:47:05.470
would like to do is be able to
do something like this but to

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:09.265
totally replace the function of
the heart and have a--this is

00:47:09.265 --> 00:47:12.679
only valuable when you're in the
operating room.

00:47:12.679 --> 00:47:21.132
It requires an extensive and
talented team to operate it to

00:47:21.132 --> 00:47:24.831
keep you alive.
What has been a goal of

00:47:24.831 --> 00:47:26.850
biomedical engineers,
for many decades,

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:29.665
is to design an artificial
heart that could be totally

00:47:29.665 --> 00:47:33.012
implanted and could replace the
function of your heart when your

00:47:33.012 --> 00:47:36.040
heart begins to fail.
We're not there yet.

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:40.489
There are still problems.
What this slide shows you

00:47:40.489 --> 00:47:44.059
is some of the designs that have
been tested over time.

00:47:44.059 --> 00:47:49.361
This is an early design,
not of an artificial heart but

00:47:49.361 --> 00:47:53.780
of an artificial ventricular
assist device.

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:56.977
This is a device that's
supposed to give your ventricle

00:47:56.977 --> 00:48:00.589
an extra boost when it needs it
if you're heart is failing and

00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:04.319
your normal cardiac muscle isn't
able to create the force to get

00:48:04.319 --> 00:48:07.280
your blood pressure and flow up
high enough.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.139
You can read more about this in
the book.

00:48:09.139 --> 00:48:13.307
These two are cartoons that
show you what was called the

00:48:13.307 --> 00:48:15.780
Jarvik heart,
the Jarvik-7 heart,

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:20.434
which was implanted in a number
of patients and still used in

00:48:20.434 --> 00:48:25.400
some clinical centers around the
world when a patient's own heart

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:29.900
has failed and they're waiting
for a heart transplant.

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.443
The surgeons will sometimes
make the decision,

00:48:32.443 --> 00:48:35.947
the patients not going to live
without some kind of support for

00:48:35.947 --> 00:48:39.207
their heart function.
They'll put an artificial heart

00:48:39.207 --> 00:48:42.546
in just to keep them alive
during the period when they're

00:48:42.546 --> 00:48:44.989
hopefully waiting for a heart to
come.

00:48:44.989 --> 00:48:48.320
This is the most recent of
those.

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:52.529
This is the AbioCor heart.
This made of the same kinds of

00:48:52.529 --> 00:48:55.550
materials we've talking about,
made of polymers.

00:48:55.550 --> 00:49:00.304
A very smooth reliable pump in
a very small form that can be

00:49:00.304 --> 00:49:04.574
hooked up to your normal
vasculature and take over the

00:49:04.574 --> 00:49:08.792
function of the heart.
Many of the problems that

00:49:08.792 --> 00:49:13.109
have been largely solved up to
this point here is to develop

00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:17.133
materials that could be in
continuous contact with blood

00:49:17.133 --> 00:49:21.304
and not have the kinds of
clotting or other reactions that

00:49:21.304 --> 00:49:26.500
could cause problems if you use
this kind of device in a person.

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:28.239
Those problems have,
not entirely,

00:49:28.239 --> 00:49:31.466
but largely been solved.
The major problem with an

00:49:31.466 --> 00:49:34.510
artificial heart now is how to
power it.

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:38.947
Producing all this mechanical
energy that's required to pump

00:49:38.947 --> 00:49:43.309
blood and keep your blood
pressure high requires energy.

00:49:43.309 --> 00:49:47.099
So, all of these hearts have an
external power source with them.

00:49:47.099 --> 00:49:53.488
There are cables that come from
inside the patient outside to a

00:49:53.488 --> 00:49:57.920
system of batteries that power
the heart.

00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:02.134
It's not possible yet to make
that power source small enough

00:50:02.134 --> 00:50:06.420
that it could be conveniently
either implanted or worn by the

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:10.584
patient for chronic use.
That's one of the biggest

00:50:10.584 --> 00:50:16.300
problems with the design of this
particular artificial organ now.

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:21.440
We'll meet this afternoon
in section, course review and

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:24.911
please come with questions.
As I mentioned,

00:50:24.911 --> 00:50:28.214
I'll have some material
prepared to just describe what's

00:50:28.214 --> 00:50:31.818
covered--what we've covered in
the last half of the course on

00:50:31.818 --> 00:50:33.240
the final.
It's been a pleasure.

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:34.240
Thanks.

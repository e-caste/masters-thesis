00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.713
Prof: So we're talking
now about mortgages and how to

00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:08.724
value them,
and if you remember now a

00:00:08.724 --> 00:00:12.022
mortgage--
so the first mortgages,

00:00:12.022 --> 00:00:14.339
by the way,
that we know of,

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.560
come from Babylonian times.
 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.862
It's not like some American
invented the mortgage or

00:00:19.862 --> 00:00:20.640
something.
 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.688
This was 3,500-3,800 years old
and we have on these cuneiform

00:00:26.688 --> 00:00:29.310
tablets these mortgages.
 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.760
And so the idea of a mortgage
is you make a promise,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.830
you back your promise with
collateral,

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.041
so if you don't keep the
promise they can take your

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.612
house,
and there's some way of getting

00:00:43.612 --> 00:00:47.470
out of the promise because
everybody knows the collateral,

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.805
you might want to leave the
home, and then you have to have

00:00:49.805 --> 00:00:51.940
some way of dissolving the
promise because the promise

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.430
involves many payments over
time.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.340
So it's making a promise,
backing it with collateral,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.011
and finding a way to dissolve
the promise at prearranged terms

00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:02.539
in case you want to end it by
prepaying.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.608
And that prepaying is called
the refinancing option.

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:10.088
And because there's a
refinancing option it makes the

00:01:10.088 --> 00:01:12.900
mortgage a much more complicated
thing,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.188
and a much more interesting
thing, and something that,

00:01:16.188 --> 00:01:18.805
for example,
a hedge fund could imagine that

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:20.629
it could make money trading.
 

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:23.796
So I just want to give you a
slight indication of how that

00:01:23.796 --> 00:01:24.629
could happen.
 

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:27.950
So as we said if you have a
typical mortgage,

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.799
say the mortgage rate is 8
percent--

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.970
maybe this is a different
answer than I did--

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.864
so here we have an 8 percent
mortgage with a 6 percent

00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:39.069
interest rate to begin with.
 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:42.325
Now, if it's an 8 percent
mortgage the guy's going to have

00:01:42.325 --> 00:01:45.810
to pay much more than 8 percent
a year because a mortgage,

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.920
remember, there are level
payments.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.560
We're talking about fixed rate
mortgages.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.769
You pay the same amount every
single year for 30 years,

00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:54.433
now you're really paying
monthly and I've ignored the

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:57.455
monthly business because it's
just too many months and there

00:01:57.455 --> 00:01:58.480
are 360 of them.
 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.140
So I'm thinking of it as an
annual payment.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.108
You have to pay,
of course, more than 8 dollars

00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:08.044
a year because if the mortgage
rate were 8 percent and you had

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:12.110
a balloon payment on the end,
you'd pay 8,8, 8,108.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.280
That's the way they used to
work, but they were changed.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.972
So you could imagine the old
fashioned mortgage would pay

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:21.536
8,8, 8,8, 8,108;
if you didn't pay your 8

00:02:21.536 --> 00:02:25.090
somewhere along the line they'd
confiscate your whole house and

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.530
then take what was owed out of
it and you could get out of it

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.620
by paying 100.
 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.697
The new mortgages instead of
paying 8 every year for 30 years

00:02:33.697 --> 00:02:37.706
you pay 8.88 every year for 30
years because if you discount

00:02:37.706 --> 00:02:41.650
payments of 8.8 for 30 years at
8 percent you get 100.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.016
So the present value is 100 at
the agreed upon discounting rate

00:02:46.016 --> 00:02:48.060
or mortgage rate 8 percent.
 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.560
And so you see how important
this discount rate is.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.043
And the remaining balance,
however, goes down because

00:02:56.043 --> 00:03:00.128
every time you're paying you're
paying more than the 8 percent

00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:01.000
interest.
 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.638
You're paying in the first year
8.8 instead of 8 and so that gap

00:03:06.638 --> 00:03:11.830
of .88 is used to reduce the
balance from 100 to 99.117.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.838
And so you see the balance is
going down over time and making

00:03:14.838 --> 00:03:17.396
the lender safer and safer
because the same house is

00:03:17.396 --> 00:03:18.150
backing it.
 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.310
So it's called an amortizing
mortgage.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.610
Now, why is it difficult to
value?

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.818
Because you have the option,
any time you want,

00:03:25.818 --> 00:03:27.960
and there's a good reason for
that option,

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.711
any time you want you have the
option of getting out of the

00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:33.473
mortgage and just saying,
"Okay, I've paid 3

00:03:33.473 --> 00:03:35.970
payments of 8.88,
I don't want to do it anymore.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.419
I want to pay off 97.13 and
then let's call it quits."

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:42.318
And they say,
"Okay,"

00:03:42.318 --> 00:03:43.610
and there's nothing they can do
about it.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.169
Now, when are you going to
exercise that option?

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.465
You're going to exercise that
option either because you have

00:03:49.465 --> 00:03:51.718
to move,
that's the intention of it,

00:03:51.718 --> 00:03:55.240
or you'll exercise it when it's
most advantageous to you.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.910
Now, why could it become
advantageous to exercise it?

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.750
Well, you don't really want to
exercise the option and this is

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.800
the way most people think of it
backwards.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.855
They think, "Oh,
the interest rates are going

00:04:05.855 --> 00:04:06.150
down.
 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.479
That means I'll get a new
mortgage with a lower interest

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:09.030
rate."
 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.038
They're hoping for exactly the
wrong thing.

00:04:12.038 --> 00:04:15.128
If the interest rates go up
what they've got is a much

00:04:15.128 --> 00:04:18.742
better mortgage because they're
continuing to buy at the same 8

00:04:18.742 --> 00:04:21.947
percent interest and maybe
interest rates in the economy

00:04:21.947 --> 00:04:25.620
have become 12 percent and
they're actually making money.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.980
So people who borrow in times
of high inflation do better.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.713
When there are times of
deflation the borrowers get

00:04:32.713 --> 00:04:33.259
crushed.
 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.466
Irving Fisher said one of the
main reasons for the Depression

00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:39.245
being so bad is all the
entrepreneurial people in the

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:41.141
country,
as usual, were borrowing,

00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:43.740
and then there was a deflation
and so they were getting

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.269
crushed.
 

00:04:44.269 --> 00:04:47.225
And the very people who drive
the economy were being hurt the

00:04:47.225 --> 00:04:47.569
most.
 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.531
And so that feedback,
he said, was responsible for

00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:53.009
part of the severity of the
Depression.

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.370
So you see interest rates can
go up or down and what happens?

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.819
When they go up,
if they go up high enough to 19

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:00.540
percent you think,
"My, gosh,

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.939
I've made a fortune holding
this mortgage.

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:08.136
I'm still borrowing at 8
percent and I can invest my

00:05:08.136 --> 00:05:10.990
money at 19 percent."
 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.228
So you've made a fortune and
the poor lender's gotten

00:05:13.228 --> 00:05:13.660
crushed.
 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.170
On the other hand if the
interest rates go way down here,

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.574
so the present value of what
you owe if you kept paying it

00:05:20.574 --> 00:05:23.507
becomes huge,
you don't have to face that big

00:05:23.507 --> 00:05:27.401
loss because you just prepay at
whatever the remaining balance

00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:30.720
is there and then you've
protected your downside.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.105
So by paying attention and
deciding when the optimal time

00:05:34.105 --> 00:05:36.706
to prepay is,
you can save yourself a lot of

00:05:36.706 --> 00:05:39.790
money and thereby cost the bank
a lot of money.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.940
So when exactly should you
prepay?

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.730
When should you exercise your
options?

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.149
Well, in this example if you
never exercised it you'd be

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:47.625
handing the bank,
effectively,

00:05:47.625 --> 00:05:50.206
120 dollars even though they
lent you 20 [correction:

00:05:50.206 --> 00:05:51.050
lent you 100].
 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.610
So the bank would have made a
20 percent profit on you.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:02.716
But if you exercise your option
optimally you're going to make

00:06:02.716 --> 00:06:05.151
not 100--
the bank is not going to get

00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:07.113
100 dollars out of you,
they're going to even get less

00:06:07.113 --> 00:06:07.769
than 100 dollars.
 

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:09.949
They're going to get 98 dollars
out of you.

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:14.560
So when exactly should you be
exercising your option?

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.750
Well, we went over this last
time.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.579
I'll do it once again.
 

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:23.254
So remember,
the payment you owed was

00:06:23.254 --> 00:06:27.930
8.88,8.88, blah,
blah, blah, 8.88.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:34.172
The remaining balance started,
of course, at 100 and then it

00:06:34.172 --> 00:06:40.519
went down to 99.11 and then it
kept going down from there.

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:44.040
So since I can't remember the
numbers let's just call this

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.254
B_1,
the remaining balance which

00:06:46.254 --> 00:06:49.220
happened to be,
you know, it was 99.11 the

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.250
first time.
 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.860
Let's call this B_1,
then I went to B_2,

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:59.110
B_3 etcetera and then
B_30 is equal to 0,

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.379
no remaining balance after that.
 

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.666
So we said, what should you
do--I'm going to do the

00:07:03.666 --> 00:07:05.680
calculation now a little bit
differently--

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.379
I said after every payment of
8.88 you could always say to

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:13.413
yourself,
"Do I want to continue or

00:07:13.413 --> 00:07:15.730
do I want to pay my
option?"

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.649
Now, you notice that if I had
divided this by B_1,

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:23.370
say, if you had a mortgage that
was a little bit smaller,

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:30.670
barely over a 1 dollar for
example,

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.190
that would divide everything by
B_1.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.261
The payments would all be
divided by B_1 and the

00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:39.440
remaining balances would all be
divided by B_1.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.410
So I could always scale this
thing up or down.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.791
There's nothing fancy about
100, nothing important about

00:07:45.791 --> 00:07:46.269
100.
 

00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:49.872
If the original loan was for
200 you just double all your

00:07:49.872 --> 00:07:53.089
payments and double all your
remaining balances.

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:54.440
What could be more obvious than
that?

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.927
So I want to think in those
terms of a mortgage that always

00:07:57.927 --> 00:07:59.129
has 1 dollar left.
 

00:07:59.129 --> 00:08:05.000
So suppose at any stage you had
1 dollar left in your mortgage.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.689
Your remaining balance was 1.
 

00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:18.968
So let's say at any node,
let's ask the question,

00:08:18.968 --> 00:08:30.319
what is the value of 1 dollar
of remaining balance?

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:33.315
So if you start at 100 and you
haven't prepaid,

00:08:33.315 --> 00:08:35.918
here you've got B_2
dollars.

00:08:35.918 --> 00:08:38.586
Of course, whatever the value
of that is divided by

00:08:38.586 --> 00:08:41.038
B_2,
that's the value of 1 dollar.

00:08:41.038 --> 00:08:45.267
So I'm just going to figure out
the value of 1 dollar of

00:08:45.267 --> 00:08:48.803
remaining balance and I'm going
to call that W,

00:08:48.803 --> 00:08:49.879
let's say.
 

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:52.370
I'll call that W of some node S.
 

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.580
So where am I?
 

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:59.254
I'm in some node in this
interest rate tree,

00:08:59.254 --> 00:09:00.308
right?
 

00:09:00.308 --> 00:09:03.528
Here's our interest rate tree,
and I'm anywhere just here,

00:09:03.528 --> 00:09:06.389
and I'm doing backward
induction so for all successor

00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:09.690
nodes I figured out what 1
dollar of remaining balance is.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:16.921
And let's say it's in period
1,2, 3,4, 5, so I'm in period 5,

00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:18.850
B_5.
 

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.620
So what is the remaining
balance at this node which I

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.100
call S?
 

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:27.860
So it's some node right there
of--oh no, I've lost it.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:32.470
So W_S is going to be
what?

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:38.775
It's going to be the minimum of
1, you could just pay it if you

00:09:38.775 --> 00:09:41.928
wanted to, or you could wait.
 

00:09:41.928 --> 00:09:46.923
1 over (1 r_S),
and then what would you have to

00:09:46.923 --> 00:09:50.669
do, you would have to make your
payment.

00:09:50.669 --> 00:09:52.149
Well, what's your payment?
 

00:09:52.149 --> 00:10:08.250
The payment is this 8.88 but
divided by B_5 plus

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:18.418
the remaining balance of 1
dollar.

00:10:18.418 --> 00:10:25.498
So (B_6 over
B_5) times the

00:10:25.498 --> 00:10:30.730
remainder times W_Sup.
 

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.740
Now, why is this right?
 

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.129
I hope it is right by the way.
 

00:10:34.129 --> 00:10:41.798
I should have thought of this a
little before.

00:10:41.798 --> 00:10:44.658
So this is the remainder of 1
dollar left.

00:10:44.658 --> 00:10:47.639
So if I divide by B_5
here I'm not going to have a

00:10:47.639 --> 00:10:49.509
remaining balance of
B_6.

00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:54.274
I'm going to have a remaining
balance of B_6 over

00:10:54.274 --> 00:10:55.590
B_5.
 

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.576
So if I started with 1 dollar
of remaining balance then I know

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:03.431
that in the next period I'm
going to have B_6 over

00:11:03.431 --> 00:11:06.830
B_5 dollars of
remaining balance left.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:16.528
It doesn't sound too
convincing, by the way.

00:11:16.528 --> 00:11:19.053
Well, it's right,
and that happens with

00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:20.450
probability 1 half.
 

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.350
And then with the other
probability 1 half,

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:29.879
plus I make the payment,
but I go down instead of up and

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:35.106
so I have B_6 over
B_5 but I have

00:11:35.106 --> 00:11:41.700
W_Sdown,
and that's also times 1 half.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:48.133
So either I pay off my
remaining dollar or I end up

00:11:48.133 --> 00:11:51.350
with this many dollars.
 

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:55.340
Assuming I had a 1 dollar of
remaining balance I'm either

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.357
going to pay it off,
the remaining balance,

00:11:58.357 --> 00:12:02.240
or I'm going to have this much
left next period and 1 dollar of

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.809
remaining balance is going to be
that.

00:12:04.809 --> 00:12:07.470
So that's it.
 

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:11.599
So I know now by working this
backwards I can tell what 1

00:12:11.599 --> 00:12:14.178
dollar at the beginning is
worth.

00:12:14.178 --> 00:12:17.015
And so it's exactly the same
calculation I did before except

00:12:17.015 --> 00:12:18.408
I'm talking about 1 dollar.
 

00:12:18.408 --> 00:12:21.125
I'm always figuring out 1
dollar of remaining balance

00:12:21.125 --> 00:12:22.639
instead of the whole thing.
 

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:25.779
Present value of callable,
so here's present value of 1

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:27.058
dollar of principal.
 

00:12:27.058 --> 00:12:31.565
And so remember the present
value of a callable mortgage was

00:12:31.565 --> 00:12:32.100
98.8.
 

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.110
Here the present value of 1
dollar,

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:38.171
figuring it out that way,
is .98, obviously it's divided

00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:41.201
by 100,
but the key is that now you can

00:12:41.201 --> 00:12:45.486
see just by looking at it where
the 1s are is where the guy

00:12:45.486 --> 00:12:47.038
decided to prepay.
 

00:12:47.038 --> 00:12:50.219
So it's the same thing as
before, but you see before you

00:12:50.219 --> 00:12:53.918
couldn't tell very easily from
the numbers when I did the 100.

00:12:53.918 --> 00:12:56.190
Sorry, that didn't quite make
it.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.216
Before when I did the present
value with the 100 all these

00:12:59.216 --> 00:13:00.649
numbers were 98s and 97s.
 

00:13:00.649 --> 00:13:02.009
I mean, where has he prepaid?
 

00:13:02.009 --> 00:13:04.028
It's hard to tell where the
prepayment is.

00:13:04.028 --> 00:13:07.105
If I do it all in terms of 1
dollar of remaining balance then

00:13:07.105 --> 00:13:10.230
just by looking at the screen I
can tell where the guy prepaid

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.820
because there are 1s there.
 

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.288
So I know where he's prepaid.
 

00:13:13.288 --> 00:13:15.460
Wherever the 1s are that means
he's prepaid.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.509
So I can tell very easily what
he did.

00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:20.779
All right, that's the only
purpose of doing the same

00:13:20.779 --> 00:13:23.408
calculation in a somewhat
trickier way.

00:13:23.408 --> 00:13:26.085
So if you think about it a
second you see I've just divided

00:13:26.085 --> 00:13:28.899
by--I've always reduced things
to if you had 1 dollar left.

00:13:28.899 --> 00:13:32.101
All right, so this tells us
what to do, when the guy should

00:13:32.101 --> 00:13:34.200
prepay and when he shouldn't
prepay.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.620
So if you're now in the world
looking at what's happening you

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:43.038
can find the historical record
of how people have prepaid.

00:13:43.038 --> 00:13:45.966
So let's just look at the
historical record,

00:13:45.966 --> 00:13:46.918
for example.
 

00:13:46.918 --> 00:13:55.621
Here, if you can see this,
this is blown up as big as it

00:13:55.621 --> 00:13:56.730
goes.
 

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:04.282
So this is what you might see
as the historical record of

00:14:04.282 --> 00:14:10.890
percentage prepayments
annualized from '86 to '99,

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:11.970
say.
 

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:15.101
So you notice that they're very
low here, and then they get to

00:14:15.101 --> 00:14:17.206
be very high,
and then they get low again,

00:14:17.206 --> 00:14:18.899
and then they get high again.
 

00:14:18.899 --> 00:14:20.799
So why do you think that
happened?

00:14:20.799 --> 00:14:21.519
So what is this?
 

00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:24.764
This is prepayments for a
particular mortgage,

00:14:24.764 --> 00:14:25.629
8 percent.
 

00:14:25.629 --> 00:14:29.903
You take all the people in the
country who started in 1986 with

00:14:29.903 --> 00:14:31.418
8 percent mortgages.
 

00:14:31.418 --> 00:14:34.058
There's a huge crowd of those
because that was about what the

00:14:34.058 --> 00:14:35.379
mortgage rate was that year.
 

00:14:35.379 --> 00:14:38.596
So a huge collection of people
got these mortgages in '86 and

00:14:38.596 --> 00:14:41.440
you keep track of what
percentage of them prepaid,

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.019
really every month,
but you write the annualized

00:14:44.019 --> 00:14:46.210
rate,
and then this is the record.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.070
So why do you think it changed
so dramatically like that?

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:49.970
What's the explanation?
 

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:50.629
Student: Stock market.
 

00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:51.309
Prof: What?
 

00:14:51.309 --> 00:14:52.710
Student: Stock market.
 

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:54.368
Prof: It looks like the
stock market,

00:14:54.368 --> 00:14:56.567
but I assure you the stock
market had almost nothing to do

00:14:56.567 --> 00:14:57.029
with it.
 

00:14:57.029 --> 00:14:59.453
Why would prepayments be so
low, and then be so high,

00:14:59.453 --> 00:15:00.759
then be low,
then be high?

00:15:00.759 --> 00:15:01.850
What do you think was happening?
 

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:02.509
Student: Interest rate
change.

00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:03.440
Prof: Interest rate.
 

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.240
We just did that.
 

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.570
We just solved that.
 

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.019
That was the whole point of
what we were doing.

00:15:07.019 --> 00:15:09.844
So you tell me,
what do you think happened in

00:15:09.844 --> 00:15:10.230
'93?
 

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.840
This is September '93.
 

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.259
I don't know if you can read
that.

00:15:14.259 --> 00:15:15.418
What do you think was going on
then?

00:15:15.418 --> 00:15:18.450
Student: Interest rates
got low.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.769
Prof: Interest rates got
low, exactly.

00:15:20.769 --> 00:15:24.490
So you may not remember this
because you were barely born.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:28.270
In the early '90s there was a
recession and then the

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.940
government cut the interest
rates.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.652
In the '90s,
the early '90s there was a

00:15:32.652 --> 00:15:35.131
recession and the government
kept cutting interest rates

00:15:35.131 --> 00:15:36.798
further, and further and
further.

00:15:36.798 --> 00:15:39.913
There was this huge decline in
interest rates through the early

00:15:39.913 --> 00:15:41.370
'90s, and so what happened?
 

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:44.784
All these people who,
in '86, who had these 8 percent

00:15:44.784 --> 00:15:48.660
mortgages--the new interest
rates were lower and so they all

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.450
prepaid.
 

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:51.360
You got this shocking amount of
prepayment.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.918
So this graph,
which seems sort of surprising

00:15:54.918 --> 00:16:00.015
and looks like the stock market,
turns out to have nothing to do

00:16:00.015 --> 00:16:02.120
with the stock market.
 

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.350
It has to do with where the
interest rates are.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:08.799
Well, do you think interest
rates explain everything?

00:16:08.799 --> 00:16:09.519
No.
 

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:15.740
What else could you notice
about the--escape.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:23.158
What else have we learned here
by doing these calculations?

00:16:23.158 --> 00:16:29.413
Well, what we've learned so far
is that if the interest rates in

00:16:29.413 --> 00:16:33.847
the economy are at 6 percent,
that's where they started,

00:16:33.847 --> 00:16:36.654
remember we said they started
at 6 percent and there was 16

00:16:36.654 --> 00:16:37.720
percent volatility.
 

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.909
Here I had 20 percent
volatility.

00:16:39.909 --> 00:16:40.678
It doesn't matter.
 

00:16:40.678 --> 00:16:43.784
I mean, that's a plausible
amount of volatility,

00:16:43.784 --> 00:16:46.230
a little high,
but that volatility.

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:53.721
The mortgage rate of 8 percent
is not going to give a value of

00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:54.460
100.
 

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.422
It's going to cheat the bank if
the homeowners are acting

00:16:57.422 --> 00:16:58.110
rationally.
 

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:01.235
The bank could get 120 if the
people weren't acting

00:17:01.235 --> 00:17:02.048
rationally.
 

00:17:02.048 --> 00:17:04.788
They were just never exercising
their option.

00:17:04.788 --> 00:17:07.865
It they're exercising their
option optimally the thing was

00:17:07.865 --> 00:17:08.730
only worth 98.
 

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.981
Now, I told you at that time
the interest rates should have

00:17:10.981 --> 00:17:12.380
been around 7 and 1 half
percent,

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:15.770
not 8 percent given this 6
percent interest rate in the

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:16.400
economy.
 

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.170
The mortgage rate should be 7
and 1 half percent.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.353
So we deduced last time that
obviously not everybody's acting

00:17:21.353 --> 00:17:21.990
optimally.
 

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:25.220
Well, you can tell that looking
at this diagram.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.838
How do you know that not
everybody's acting optimally?

00:17:28.838 --> 00:17:32.067
Remember these are '86
mortgages, so everybody's taking

00:17:32.067 --> 00:17:35.596
them out at the same time within
a few months of each other,

00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:37.509
the same 8 percent mortgage.
 

00:17:37.509 --> 00:17:42.406
How can you tell from this
graph that they're not

00:17:42.406 --> 00:17:46.079
exercising their option
optimally?

00:17:46.079 --> 00:17:47.410
It's completely obvious.
 

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:49.910
Just looking at it for one
second you can say,

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:53.117
"Oh, these people can't be
exercising their option

00:17:53.117 --> 00:17:54.960
optimally,"
why is that?

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.740
Yes?
 

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.971
Student: They should be
exercising all at the same time

00:17:58.971 --> 00:18:00.720
if they were acting rationally.
 

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.805
Prof: So as he says
we've just done the calculation

00:18:03.805 --> 00:18:05.048
with those 1s and 0s.
 

00:18:05.048 --> 00:18:08.258
I told you when the right time
to exercise the option is,

00:18:08.258 --> 00:18:10.778
so, everybody's got the same
circumstance.

00:18:10.778 --> 00:18:13.986
Every single person if all
they're trying to do is minimize

00:18:13.986 --> 00:18:16.915
the present value of their
payments they should all be

00:18:16.915 --> 00:18:18.630
prepaying at the same time.
 

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.328
Here you see that very few
people are prepaying,

00:18:21.328 --> 00:18:25.826
but it's getting up to almost
10 percent so probably this is a

00:18:25.826 --> 00:18:29.347
stupid time to prepay,
but the point is still 10

00:18:29.347 --> 00:18:31.430
percent of them are prepaying.
 

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:34.684
And over here when presumably
you ought to prepay,

00:18:34.684 --> 00:18:37.740
in the entire year,
right, they have 12 chances

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.068
during the year.
 

00:18:39.068 --> 00:18:42.791
It takes them an entire year
and only 60 percent of them have

00:18:42.791 --> 00:18:45.150
figured out that they should
prepay.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.818
So you know they're not acting
optimally.

00:18:48.818 --> 00:18:50.896
So just from that graph that
would tell you,

00:18:50.896 --> 00:18:52.828
and you have further evidence
of that.

00:18:52.828 --> 00:18:55.960
That's evidence that they
aren't acting optimally.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.407
Furthermore you have evidence
that the banks don't expect them

00:18:59.407 --> 00:19:02.913
to be acting optimally because
the banks aren't charging them 8

00:19:02.913 --> 00:19:06.138
or 9 percent interest,
which is what they would need

00:19:06.138 --> 00:19:08.250
to pay to get the thing worth
100,

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.974
they're charging them 7 and 1
half percent interest which for

00:19:11.974 --> 00:19:15.950
the optimal pre-payer is worth
much less than 100 to the bank.

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:17.259
So the banks wouldn't do that.
 

00:19:17.259 --> 00:19:19.109
They would just go out of
business if they did something

00:19:19.109 --> 00:19:19.750
stupid like that.
 

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:23.265
They wouldn't do that unless
they thought that the homeowners

00:19:23.265 --> 00:19:25.549
weren't acting,
at least not all of them

00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:26.838
acting, optimally.
 

00:19:26.838 --> 00:19:31.582
So suppose you had to predict
how people are going to act in

00:19:31.582 --> 00:19:35.200
the future and you wanted to
trade on that?

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.108
What would you do?
 

00:19:38.108 --> 00:19:40.358
How would you think about
predicting it?

00:19:40.358 --> 00:19:41.750
So this is the data that you
have.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.950
What would you do?
 

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:44.710
You have this data.
 

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.048
These are 8 percent things.
 

00:19:46.048 --> 00:19:48.722
You also have 9 percent
mortgages issued the year

00:19:48.722 --> 00:19:50.564
before,
and then maybe a year before

00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:53.180
that there were 8 and 1 half
percent interest and you have

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.040
that history,
and you've got all these

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.338
different pools and all these
different histories.

00:19:57.338 --> 00:20:03.832
How would you think about
figuring out a prepayment--how

00:20:03.832 --> 00:20:07.608
would you predict prepayments?
 

00:20:07.608 --> 00:20:10.882
Well, the way economists,
macro economists at least in

00:20:10.882 --> 00:20:14.327
the old days,
used to make predictions,

00:20:14.327 --> 00:20:17.520
they would say,
"Hum, the first quarter

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.880
looks pretty good."
 

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.450
What are they predicting now?
 

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:24.058
Now, they're saying
unemployment is probably going

00:20:24.058 --> 00:20:28.183
to keep rising for the next
quarter or two well until the

00:20:28.183 --> 00:20:30.777
next year,
but at that point things are

00:20:30.777 --> 00:20:33.538
going to turn around and we
expect the economy to get

00:20:33.538 --> 00:20:35.991
stronger,
come out of its recession and

00:20:35.991 --> 00:20:39.577
unemployment should gradually
improve from its high which we

00:20:39.577 --> 00:20:43.101
expect will be 10 and 1 half
percent to something back down

00:20:43.101 --> 00:20:45.348
to 6 percent by the end of 2011.
 

00:20:45.348 --> 00:20:47.960
That's more or less the
economists' prediction.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.490
Now, can you make a prediction
like that about prepayments?

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:53.480
Would it make sense to make a
prediction about that?

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:59.460
Why is that an utterly stupid
kind of prediction?

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.940
What is the essence of good
prediction?

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.938
If you wanted to predict
something and you were going to

00:21:06.938 --> 00:21:10.045
lose a lot of money if your
prediction was wrong how would

00:21:10.045 --> 00:21:13.152
you refine your prediction
compared to what I just gave as

00:21:13.152 --> 00:21:14.569
a sample prediction?
 

00:21:14.569 --> 00:21:15.250
Yep?
 

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.682
Student: You have to
have a number of scenarios and

00:21:16.682 --> 00:21:17.311
&gt;
 

00:21:17.311 --> 00:21:17.690
to each one.
 

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:18.680
Prof: Exactly.
 

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.623
So what he said is if you're
even the slightest bit

00:21:22.623 --> 00:21:27.276
sophisticated you're not going
to make a bald non-contingent

00:21:27.276 --> 00:21:28.460
prediction.
 

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.740
Things are going to get worse
the next two quarters,

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.288
then they're going to start
getting better,

00:21:32.288 --> 00:21:36.917
then things are going to get as
well as they're going to get

00:21:36.917 --> 00:21:38.328
after two years.
 

00:21:38.328 --> 00:21:39.618
You'll solve the problem after
two years.

00:21:39.618 --> 00:21:43.339
What happens if another war
breaks out in Iraq?

00:21:43.339 --> 00:21:45.170
What if Iran bombs Israel?
 

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:49.750
What if there's another crash
in commercial real estate?

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:53.009
How could that prediction
possibly turn out to be true?

00:21:53.009 --> 00:21:54.940
It's a sure thing it's going to
be wrong.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.647
It's just impossible that's
going to be right because the

00:21:57.647 --> 00:22:00.500
guy making the prediction has
made no contingencies built in

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.420
his prediction.
 

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.460
You know that guy's making a
prediction for free.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.070
Someone may be paying him to
hear him, but he's not going to

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.930
be penalized if his prediction
is wrong.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:10.930
No one in their right mind
would make such a prediction.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:14.713
So the first thing you should
do in predicting prepayments is

00:22:14.713 --> 00:22:18.308
to realize that you've got a
tree of possible futures,

00:22:18.308 --> 00:22:22.045
and given this tree of possible
futures you're going to predict

00:22:22.045 --> 00:22:25.778
different prepayments depending
on where you go on the tree.

00:22:25.778 --> 00:22:32.113
So you see, prediction is not a
simple one event--it's not a one

00:22:32.113 --> 00:22:33.420
shot thing.
 

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:37.380
Just as he so aptly put it,
it's a many scenario thing.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.001
You have to predict on many,
many scenarios what you think

00:22:40.001 --> 00:22:43.038
will happen and that makes your
prediction much better because,

00:22:43.038 --> 00:22:44.848
of course, if there is a war in
Iraq,

00:22:44.848 --> 00:22:46.680
and if there is a catastrophe
in Afghanistan,

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.837
and if Iran does bomb Israel,
and if the commercial real

00:22:49.837 --> 00:22:53.398
estate market collapses things
are going to be a lot worse than

00:22:53.398 --> 00:22:55.410
this original guy's prediction.
 

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:59.784
So everybody knows that,
so why not make the prediction

00:22:59.784 --> 00:23:01.078
more sensible?
 

00:23:01.078 --> 00:23:06.528
So, on Wall Street that's what
everybody's done for 20 years.

00:23:06.528 --> 00:23:09.140
Now, they haven't done it for
30 years.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.108
It's just 20 years that they've
been doing that.

00:23:12.108 --> 00:23:18.383
So when I got to Kidder Peabody
in 1990 they were making these

00:23:18.383 --> 00:23:21.160
one scenario predictions.
 

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:24.598
It's a long story which I'll
tell maybe Sunday night.

00:23:24.598 --> 00:23:27.663
I ended up in charge of the
Research Department and so we

00:23:27.663 --> 00:23:29.962
made, you know,
other firms were doing this

00:23:29.962 --> 00:23:32.588
already, we made scenario
predictions, okay?

00:23:32.588 --> 00:23:35.025
So now what kind of scenario
predictions are you going to

00:23:35.025 --> 00:23:35.328
make?
 

00:23:35.328 --> 00:23:38.776
When you make contingent
predictions there are an awful

00:23:38.776 --> 00:23:39.670
lot of them.
 

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:43.428
You can't even write them all
down, so what you have to do is

00:23:43.428 --> 00:23:45.118
you have to have a model.
 

00:23:45.118 --> 00:23:49.720
So what kind of model should
you have?

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.890
I'll tell you now what the
standard guys were doing on Wall

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:55.400
Street at the time.
 

00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:00.207
They were saying--here's
interest rate,

00:24:00.207 --> 00:24:01.220
sorry.
 

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.640
Here's the present value of a
mortgage.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.906
Here's the present value of a
callable mortgage,

00:24:04.906 --> 00:24:07.367
present value of 1 dollar of
principal, so realistic

00:24:07.367 --> 00:24:08.140
prepayments.
 

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:12.848
So if we go over here we'll see
that people said,

00:24:12.848 --> 00:24:15.638
"Look, from this graph
it's clear,"

00:24:15.638 --> 00:24:19.653
they would say,
"that when interest rates

00:24:19.653 --> 00:24:25.306
went down people prepay more so
why don't we have a function

00:24:25.306 --> 00:24:28.180
that looks like this?"
 

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:39.529
So, prepay, that's the
percentage of remaining balance

00:24:39.529 --> 00:24:43.599
that is paid off.
 

00:24:43.599 --> 00:24:45.720
So what does that mean?
 

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.407
Remember, after you've made
your coupon payment you have a

00:24:48.407 --> 00:24:50.058
remaining balance,
B_5.

00:24:50.058 --> 00:24:52.846
You could pay all of it,
or none of it,

00:24:52.846 --> 00:24:54.019
or half of it.
 

00:24:54.019 --> 00:24:56.712
So the prepay is what
percentage of the

00:24:56.712 --> 00:25:00.538
B_5--that's just after
you've paid, right?

00:25:00.538 --> 00:25:02.068
So, B_2 lets do that
one.

00:25:02.068 --> 00:25:03.925
B_2,
just after you've paid 8.88 the

00:25:03.925 --> 00:25:06.318
remaining balance has now been
reduced to B_2.

00:25:06.318 --> 00:25:09.204
You could, in addition to the
8.88, pay off all of that

00:25:09.204 --> 00:25:10.058
B_2.
 

00:25:10.058 --> 00:25:12.884
Typically some people who are
alert and think it's a good time

00:25:12.884 --> 00:25:14.828
to prepay will pay all of
B_2.

00:25:14.828 --> 00:25:17.818
Others will pay none of
B_2.

00:25:17.818 --> 00:25:21.169
So if you aggregate over the
whole collection of people the

00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:23.820
prepay percentages,
out of the sums of all their

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.828
B_2s what percentage
of them are going to pay off.

00:25:26.828 --> 00:25:29.730
So we look at the aggregate
prepayment.

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:31.220
That's the old fashioned way.
 

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.763
And we say, "What
percentage of the remaining

00:25:34.763 --> 00:25:36.788
balance is paid off?"
 

00:25:36.788 --> 00:25:38.538
So you'd make a function like
this.

00:25:38.538 --> 00:25:41.576
You'd say, "Well,
prepaid might equal 10

00:25:41.576 --> 00:25:42.680
percent."
 

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.828
Why am I picking 10 percent?
 

00:25:44.828 --> 00:25:51.734
So if you go back to this
picture you see that prepayments

00:25:51.734 --> 00:25:58.519
seem to be around 10 percent
when nothing's happening.

00:25:58.519 --> 00:26:03.273
So you say 10 percent plus
maybe you're going to get some

00:26:03.273 --> 00:26:08.451
more prepayments so you might
write--well, I just wrote down a

00:26:08.451 --> 00:26:10.660
function plus the min.
 

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.252
The min, say,
of .60 because it never seems

00:26:13.252 --> 00:26:16.834
to get over 60 percent if you
look at that you see it never

00:26:16.834 --> 00:26:18.808
gets over 60 percent really.
 

00:26:18.808 --> 00:26:31.750
So the min of 60 and 15 times
the max of 0 and (M -

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:40.548
r_S - sigma over 133).
 

00:26:40.548 --> 00:26:43.130
That would be a kind of
prepayment function.

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:47.769
So what does this say?
 

00:26:47.769 --> 00:26:48.740
What happens?
 

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.784
You're normally going to
pay--so this is this whole

00:26:51.784 --> 00:26:55.239
function here,
so I should write this as .1

00:26:55.239 --> 00:26:58.349
plus, can you see that over
there,

00:26:58.349 --> 00:27:02.970
maybe not, so this plus .1.
 

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:08.464
So there's a baseline of 10
percent and if the interest rate

00:27:08.464 --> 00:27:10.695
is high,
so the interest rate is above

00:27:10.695 --> 00:27:13.316
the mortgage rate no one else is
going to prepay because this is

00:27:13.316 --> 00:27:15.480
going to be a negative number
and this will be 0.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:19.848
So you're just going to do
.1,10 percent.

00:27:19.848 --> 00:27:22.680
On the other hand,
as the interest rate gets low

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.294
and falls far enough below the
mortgage rate people are going

00:27:26.294 --> 00:27:28.486
to say to themselves,
"Ah-ha!

00:27:28.486 --> 00:27:30.470
I have a big incentive to
prepay now.

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.912
Maybe interest rates have gone
down so far I can no longer hope

00:27:32.912 --> 00:27:35.038
they're going to go back up
above the mortgage rate.

00:27:35.038 --> 00:27:37.808
I should start prepaying
more."

00:27:37.808 --> 00:27:41.154
So more people are going to
prepay and this thing is going

00:27:41.154 --> 00:27:41.798
to go up.
 

00:27:41.798 --> 00:27:46.402
I just multiply it by some
constant, but it'll never go up

00:27:46.402 --> 00:27:48.259
more than 60 percent.
 

00:27:48.259 --> 00:27:49.538
That's what this function says.
 

00:27:49.538 --> 00:27:53.134
And sigma, this is the
volatility--all right,

00:27:53.134 --> 00:27:55.828
so let's just leave that aside.
 

00:27:55.828 --> 00:27:58.439
So there's a prepayment
function that seems to sort of

00:27:58.439 --> 00:27:59.720
capture what's going on.
 

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:03.200
It's usually around 10 percent
when there's no incentive.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.450
It never gets above 60 percent,
but as the incentive to prepay,

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.150
as interest rates get lower and
the incentive to prepay

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:10.230
increases,
more and more people prepay.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:12.038
That's kind of the idea.
 

00:28:12.038 --> 00:28:16.240
All right, and then you would
fit fancier curves than that.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.698
You would look at M -
r_T and you would fit

00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:21.759
a curve that looks like this.
 

00:28:21.759 --> 00:28:23.890
So if there's just a little bit
of incentive to prepay,

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.059
the rates are a little bit
lower than the mortgage rate,

00:28:26.059 --> 00:28:26.808
nobody does it.
 

00:28:26.808 --> 00:28:29.700
Then quickly a lot of people do
it and then they stop doing it.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.557
So this is like 60 percent and
most of the time you're around

00:28:33.557 --> 00:28:36.450
10 percent, and you try and fit
this curve.

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:38.865
You're going to have millions
of parameters and since you have

00:28:38.865 --> 00:28:40.450
so much data you could fit
parameters.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:44.497
That was the old fashioned way
and that's how people would

00:28:44.497 --> 00:28:46.058
predict prepayments.
 

00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:48.980
Now, that's not going to turn
out to be such a great way,

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.118
but it certainly teaches you
something.

00:28:51.118 --> 00:28:55.493
So let's look at what happens
if you now--with those realistic

00:28:55.493 --> 00:28:59.078
prepayments you compute the
value of a mortgage.

00:28:59.078 --> 00:29:03.730
So this is the prepayment that
you'd get for the different

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:08.546
rates and so you can see that as
the rates go down the total

00:29:08.546 --> 00:29:10.750
prepayment is going up.
 

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:12.462
And by the way,
it's more than 60 percent

00:29:12.462 --> 00:29:15.118
because you've got this 10
percent added to the 60 percent,

00:29:15.118 --> 00:29:16.819
so the most it could be is 70
percent,

00:29:16.819 --> 00:29:19.019
which it hits over here.
 

00:29:19.019 --> 00:29:22.402
So you get 70 percent as the
maximum prepayments,

00:29:22.402 --> 00:29:26.419
and as interest rates get
higher no one prepays except the

00:29:26.419 --> 00:29:28.038
10 percent of guys.
 

00:29:28.038 --> 00:29:30.702
Now, by the way,
why are people prepaying over

00:29:30.702 --> 00:29:33.009
here even when the rates are so
high?

00:29:33.009 --> 00:29:35.307
It's because some people are
moving or they're getting

00:29:35.307 --> 00:29:37.259
divorced and they have to sell
their house.

00:29:37.259 --> 00:29:40.453
So obviously you're going to
get some prepayments no matter

00:29:40.453 --> 00:29:40.838
what.
 

00:29:40.838 --> 00:29:43.657
People have to prepay,
and why is it that people never

00:29:43.657 --> 00:29:46.529
prepay more than 60 percent
historically or 70 percent,

00:29:46.529 --> 00:29:48.710
because not everybody pays
attention.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:51.103
Now, I called them the dumb
guys last time,

00:29:51.103 --> 00:29:53.269
but as I said,
I probably fit into that

00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:54.009
category.
 

00:29:54.009 --> 00:29:56.220
It's people who are distracted
and doing other things.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.045
They're just not paying
attention and so they don't

00:29:58.045 --> 00:29:58.410
realize.
 

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:00.585
They don't know what's going
on, so they don't realize they

00:30:00.585 --> 00:30:01.410
should be prepaying.
 

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:03.568
So as interest rates go down
more people prepay.

00:30:03.568 --> 00:30:05.348
As interest rates go up less
people prepay.

00:30:05.348 --> 00:30:09.032
And if you did some historical
thing and figured out the right

00:30:09.032 --> 00:30:11.750
parameters you'd get a
prepayment function.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:14.420
So how did I figure out this
was 15?

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.390
How did I figure out this was
.6?

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:18.720
Why should I divide this by 133?
 

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.630
What's sigma?
 

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:23.386
Once you get those parameters
historically you now have a

00:30:23.386 --> 00:30:27.950
well-determined behavior rule of
what people are going to prepay,

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:31.124
and from that you can figure
out what the prices are of any

00:30:31.124 --> 00:30:32.930
mortgage by backward induction.
 

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:35.170
So how would you do it again by
backward induction?

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:36.618
The same we always did it.
 

00:30:36.618 --> 00:30:42.970
Over here, what would you do
over here?

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:54.068
How would you change this rule?
 

00:30:54.068 --> 00:30:57.509
Well, you would just be feeding
in the prepayment function.

00:30:57.509 --> 00:31:09.190
So what would the prepayment
function be?

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.192
Well, people wouldn't be doing
a minimum here,

00:31:11.192 --> 00:31:11.548
right?
 

00:31:11.548 --> 00:31:13.348
They're not deciding whether or
not to prepay,

00:31:13.348 --> 00:31:14.349
they're just prepaying.
 

00:31:14.349 --> 00:31:18.150
So let's get rid of that.
 

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:19.690
They're prepaying.
 

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:24.250
So this is the value of 1
dollars left of principal.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:28.065
So some of them are prepaying
and that's the function,

00:31:28.065 --> 00:31:31.880
so prepay, and that depends on
what node you're at.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.971
And here it says what
percentage of the remaining

00:31:34.971 --> 00:31:36.710
balance is being prepaid.
 

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:39.558
So that tells you,
that rule, who's prepaying,

00:31:39.558 --> 00:31:43.638
and then with the rest of the
money that's going on until next

00:31:43.638 --> 00:31:51.018
time 1 minus that same thing,
1 minus prepay times exactly

00:31:51.018 --> 00:31:54.759
what we had before.
 

00:31:54.759 --> 00:31:57.999
So this part of 1 dollar got
prepaid immediately so that's

00:31:57.999 --> 00:32:00.500
the cash that went to the
mortgage holder.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:07.327
The rest of the cash got saved
until next time and here's what

00:32:07.327 --> 00:32:09.118
happens to it.
 

00:32:09.118 --> 00:32:13.898
You have to make your coupon,
then you have a remaining

00:32:13.898 --> 00:32:18.855
balance, and then whatever is
going to happen is going to

00:32:18.855 --> 00:32:19.828
happen.
 

00:32:19.828 --> 00:32:25.410
So you'll study this and you'll
figure out I'm sure.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:29.068
It takes a little bit of effort
to see that through,

00:32:29.068 --> 00:32:33.133
but with half an hour staring
at it you'll understand how this

00:32:33.133 --> 00:32:36.998
works and you'll read it in a
spreadsheet so you can figure

00:32:36.998 --> 00:32:39.130
out the value of a mortgage.
 

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:41.986
You get a value of a mortgage,
and now we can start doing

00:32:41.986 --> 00:32:44.690
experiments by changing the
parameters and see how the

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:45.660
mortgage works.
 

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:50.396
Now, before I do that I want to
say that there's a better way to

00:32:50.396 --> 00:32:51.150
do this.
 

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:55.460
I mean, maybe these numbers are
estimated--what's a better way

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:56.450
of doing it?
 

00:32:56.450 --> 00:33:00.890
How did I do it at Ellington,
how did we--I mean at Kidder

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:01.670
Peabody?
 

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:03.808
How did we predict prepayments?
 

00:33:03.808 --> 00:33:08.480
What's another way at looking
at prepayments?

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:14.558
Let me tell you something
that's missing.

00:33:14.558 --> 00:33:18.077
I used to ask people who wanted
to work at Kidder Peabody or

00:33:18.077 --> 00:33:20.940
Ellington the following little
simple puzzle,

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:24.183
and most of the genius
mathematicians always got this

00:33:24.183 --> 00:33:25.118
answer wrong.
 

00:33:25.118 --> 00:33:27.996
Of course we hired them anyway,
but they'd always get this

00:33:27.996 --> 00:33:28.400
wrong.
 

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.012
So the question is,
suppose you've got a group of

00:33:32.012 --> 00:33:36.230
people like this and you figure
out what the value of the

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:38.883
mortgage is,
and interest rates have been

00:33:38.883 --> 00:33:40.058
constant all this time.
 

00:33:40.058 --> 00:33:43.648
Let's suppose for one month
interest rates shoot down,

00:33:43.648 --> 00:33:46.425
interest rates collapse and
half the pool,

00:33:46.425 --> 00:33:49.000
60 percent of the pool
disappears.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.780
So now you've only got 40
percent of the people left you

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.713
had before, and then interest
rates return to exactly where

00:33:54.713 --> 00:33:56.130
they were to begin with.
 

00:33:56.130 --> 00:34:00.319
Should the pool that's left be
worth 40 percent of the pool

00:34:00.319 --> 00:34:03.715
that you had just here,
or more than 40 percent,

00:34:03.715 --> 00:34:05.740
or less than 40 percent?
 

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.489
So remember,
you had 100 people here.

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:10.960
You're the bank who's lent them
the money.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.639
You're valuing the mortgage
payments they're going to make

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:15.438
to you,
you're getting a certain amount

00:34:15.438 --> 00:34:18.353
of money from them,
60 percent of them suddenly

00:34:18.353 --> 00:34:21.409
disappeared in 1 month leaving
40 left,

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:25.190
but now interest rates are back
exactly where they were before.

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:27.849
Is the value of the mortgage
starting here with the 40

00:34:27.849 --> 00:34:30.809
percent pool worth 40 percent of
what it was originally,

00:34:30.809 --> 00:34:32.980
more than 40 percent or less
than 40 percent?

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:33.940
What do you think?
 

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:35.780
Yes?
 

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.992
Student: Is it worth
more than 40 percent because

00:34:37.992 --> 00:34:40.284
those people don't understand
interest rates and therefore

00:34:40.284 --> 00:34:41.733
they're not
&gt;

00:34:41.733 --> 00:34:43.503
option properly and
&gt;

00:34:43.503 --> 00:34:44.469
their mortgages?
 

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:45.340
Prof: Exactly.
 

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.900
So that's an incredibly
important point.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:49.900
It's called the opposite of
adverse selection.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:55.233
Every one of these events is
selecting the people left not

00:34:55.233 --> 00:34:57.563
adversely,
not perversely,

00:34:57.563 --> 00:35:00.159
what's the opposite of
adversely,

00:35:00.159 --> 00:35:02.744
favorably to you,
so the guys who are left are

00:35:02.744 --> 00:35:04.605
all losers,
but that's who you want to deal

00:35:04.605 --> 00:35:04.809
with.
 

00:35:04.809 --> 00:35:07.030
You don't want to trade with
the geniuses.

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:09.159
You want to trade with the guy
who's not paying any attention.

00:35:09.159 --> 00:35:12.342
So the guys left are the people
who are never going to prepay or

00:35:12.342 --> 00:35:15.070
hardly ever going to prepay and
so it's much better.

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:18.545
Now, this function doesn't
capture that at all,

00:35:18.545 --> 00:35:19.150
right?
 

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.469
It doesn't say anything.
 

00:35:20.469 --> 00:35:23.739
It just says your prepayment's
depending on where you are.

00:35:23.739 --> 00:35:27.110
So whether you were here or
here you're going to get the

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:29.746
same prepayment,
but we know that that's not

00:35:29.746 --> 00:35:31.280
going to be the case.
 

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.248
In fact, it's clear that over
here there must have been a much

00:35:34.248 --> 00:35:36.440
bigger incentive than there was
over there.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.228
So the prepayments are the
same, but actually interest

00:35:39.228 --> 00:35:42.230
rates here were vastly lower
than interest rates there.

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:45.590
So this is not such a good
function.

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:47.510
So how would you improve?
 

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:50.829
What would you do to take into
account this adverse selection,

00:35:50.829 --> 00:35:52.679
or actually pro-verse
selection?

00:35:52.679 --> 00:35:58.090
What is the opposite of adverse?
 

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:01.269
Well, it doesn't matter.
 

00:36:01.269 --> 00:36:03.710
What would you think to do?
 

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:06.266
Your whole livelihood depends
on it, millions,

00:36:06.266 --> 00:36:08.369
trillions of dollars at stake
here.

00:36:08.369 --> 00:36:11.356
You've got to model prepayments
correctly, so how would you

00:36:11.356 --> 00:36:12.489
think of doing this?
 

00:36:12.489 --> 00:36:15.951
Just give me some sense of what
a hedge fund does or what anyone

00:36:15.951 --> 00:36:17.820
in this market would have to do.
 

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:20.670
Well, most of them did this.
 

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:23.389
So what would you do?
 

00:36:23.389 --> 00:36:24.329
Yeah?
 

00:36:24.329 --> 00:36:29.561
Student: Buy up old
mortgages, because the market is

00:36:29.561 --> 00:36:33.170
probably under estimating their
value.

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:34.619
Prof: Well you would buy
it up when?

00:36:34.619 --> 00:36:36.619
Student: Right after...
 

00:36:36.619 --> 00:36:40.327
Prof: Right here you'd
buy it up, right there,

00:36:40.327 --> 00:36:44.179
but what model would you use to
predict prepayments?

00:36:44.179 --> 00:36:49.599
Not this one,
so how would you imagine doing

00:36:49.599 --> 00:36:50.230
it.
 

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:56.286
You would imagine making a
model just like your intuition,

00:36:56.286 --> 00:36:59.579
so what does that mean doing?
 

00:36:59.579 --> 00:37:01.829
Someone's asking you to run a
research department,

00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:03.760
make a model of forecasting
prepayments.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.170
All the data you have is
aggregate data like that.

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:08.719
You can't observe individual
homeowners in those days.

00:37:08.719 --> 00:37:10.329
They wouldn't give you the
information.

00:37:10.329 --> 00:37:12.489
I'll explain all that Sunday
night.

00:37:12.489 --> 00:37:18.782
So this is the kind of data you
have, what the whole group of

00:37:18.782 --> 00:37:24.760
people is doing every year,
but what would you do to build

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.230
the model?
 

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:29.097
Adverse selection is very
important or pro-verse

00:37:29.097 --> 00:37:29.829
selection.
 

00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:32.380
It's embarrassing I don't
remember the word,

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.110
favorable selection,
a very important thing.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:37.880
So how would you capture that
in your model?

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:38.670
Yep?
 

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:41.628
Student: Would you split
it into two groups and then

00:37:41.628 --> 00:37:42.750
model it separately?
 

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:47.940
Prof: So maybe another
thing you could do,

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:51.706
what if you instead of having
this function that says what the

00:37:51.706 --> 00:37:54.920
aggregate's going to do all the
data's aggregate,

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:57.099
so all you can do is test
against aggregate data.

00:37:57.099 --> 00:38:00.960
But suppose you said,
"The world,

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.831
all we can see is the
aggregate, but the people really

00:38:03.831 --> 00:38:06.659
acting are individuals acting,
not the aggregate.

00:38:06.659 --> 00:38:09.653
It's the sum of individual
activities, so what we should do

00:38:09.653 --> 00:38:12.030
now is have different kinds of
people."

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:15.059
Oh gosh, sorry.
 

00:38:15.059 --> 00:38:19.699
It was there already.
 

00:38:19.699 --> 00:38:27.710
So let's go back to where we
were before, so realistic.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:30.769
What you ought to do is you
ought to say,

00:38:30.769 --> 00:38:35.590
well, 8 percent--remember we
had two kinds of people already.

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:37.579
We've already got two kinds of
people, sorry.

00:38:37.579 --> 00:38:41.900
We've got these guys,
the guys who never call,

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:43.820
so they're people.
 

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.170
That's a kind of person.
 

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:48.331
And suppose you go down here
and you have the people who are

00:38:48.331 --> 00:38:49.510
optimally prepaying?
 

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:52.512
Suppose you imagine that half
the people were optimally

00:38:52.512 --> 00:38:55.070
prepaying and half the people
never prepaid?

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:59.630
Well, would that explain this
favorable selection?

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:02.585
Absolutely it would explain it
because when you went through

00:39:02.585 --> 00:39:04.489
your little tree and you went
here,

00:39:04.489 --> 00:39:09.105
and here, and here,
and here, by the time you got

00:39:09.105 --> 00:39:13.974
down here all those people,
all the optimal pre-payers

00:39:13.974 --> 00:39:15.730
they're all prepaying.
 

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:18.572
So you start off with
half-optimal guys and

00:39:18.572 --> 00:39:19.860
half-asleep guys.
 

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:22.592
Once you get down here all the
optimal guys have disappeared

00:39:22.592 --> 00:39:24.539
and the pool that's left is all
asleep,

00:39:24.539 --> 00:39:27.690
so of course the pool is worth
much more here given the

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:29.909
interest rate than it was over
here.

00:39:29.909 --> 00:39:34.684
In fact, if it goes back then
again to here where it was

00:39:34.684 --> 00:39:37.550
before--sorry that's same line.
 

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:40.349
If it goes back to here--have I
done this right?

00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:42.630
No, I've got to go back twice
here and then here.

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:45.532
So once it goes back to here if
it goes here,

00:39:45.532 --> 00:39:49.291
here, here and here then the
pool is going to be much more

00:39:49.291 --> 00:39:51.929
valuable here than it started
there.

00:39:51.929 --> 00:39:54.744
There are half as many people,
but it's worth much more than

00:39:54.744 --> 00:39:56.079
half of what it was there.
 

00:39:56.079 --> 00:40:00.072
So the way to do this is to
break--so then you're looking at

00:40:00.072 --> 00:40:01.289
the individuals.
 

00:40:01.289 --> 00:40:03.838
You're saying one class of
people is very smart,

00:40:03.838 --> 00:40:07.148
or one class of people is very
alert, it's a much better word,

00:40:07.148 --> 00:40:09.210
one class of people is very
alert.

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:12.010
One class of people is very
un-alert and as you go through

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:14.909
the tree the alert people are
going to disappear faster than

00:40:14.909 --> 00:40:17.710
the non-alert people and that's
why you're going to have a

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:20.610
favorable selection of people
who's left in the pool.

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:24.010
Well, of course,
there are no extremes of

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:29.112
perfectly rational or perfectly
asleep in the economy so what

00:40:29.112 --> 00:40:33.280
you can do is you can make
people in between.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.570
How do you make them in between?
 

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:36.360
Well, suppose that,
for example,

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.690
I only did one thing.
 

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:40.119
Suppose it's costly to prepay?
 

00:40:40.119 --> 00:40:41.887
Some people just say to
themselves, "I'm going to

00:40:41.887 --> 00:40:43.190
have to take a whole day off of
work.

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:45.099
I'm not going to write my paper.
 

00:40:45.099 --> 00:40:48.579
I might lose some business that
I was going to do that day.

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:52.568
A whole bunch of stuff I'm
losing, so I'm going to subtract

00:40:52.568 --> 00:40:53.050
that.
 

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.960
I'm not going to prepay.
 

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:58.023
I'm not going to even think
about doing it unless I can get

00:40:58.023 --> 00:41:00.929
at least a certain benefit from
having done it."

00:41:00.929 --> 00:41:04.161
So you can add a cost of
prepaying and people aren't

00:41:04.161 --> 00:41:07.835
going to prepay unless the gain
that they have by prepaying

00:41:07.835 --> 00:41:10.750
exceeds the cost of doing the
prepayments.

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:14.480
So to take the simplest case
let's suppose the very act of--

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.730
never mind the thinking and all
that--

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:18.983
the very act of prepaying,
going to the bank literally

00:41:18.983 --> 00:41:20.090
costs you money.
 

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:24.586
So if you have a value,
if the thing is 100 and you can

00:41:24.586 --> 00:41:26.802
prepay,
you know, if you do your

00:41:26.802 --> 00:41:30.202
calculations and don't prepay
today it's worth 98 and if you

00:41:30.202 --> 00:41:33.373
prepay today the remaining
balance is 94 you're saving 4

00:41:33.373 --> 00:41:35.664
dollars,
but if the cost of prepayment

00:41:35.664 --> 00:41:37.610
is 5 you're still not going to
do it.

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:39.766
So you get a guy with a high
cost of prepaying,

00:41:39.766 --> 00:41:42.485
an infinite cost of prepaying,
he's going to look like he's

00:41:42.485 --> 00:41:43.469
totally un-alert.
 

00:41:43.469 --> 00:41:46.130
A guy with zero cost of paying
is going to look like he's

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:46.889
totally alert.
 

00:41:46.889 --> 00:41:51.594
So you can have gradations of
rationality, and you can have

00:41:51.594 --> 00:41:53.460
different dimensions.
 

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:58.447
So you can have cost of
prepaying and you can have

00:41:58.447 --> 00:41:59.670
alertness.
 

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:03.246
What's the percentage of time
you're actually paying attention

00:42:03.246 --> 00:42:04.010
that month?
 

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:06.760
What fraction of the months do
you actually pay attention,

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.704
and you can have a distribution
of people, different costs and

00:42:09.704 --> 00:42:10.960
different alertnesses.
 

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:14.269
So that's the model that I
built.

00:42:14.269 --> 00:42:16.380
It's a simplified form of it.
 

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:18.409
It gives you an idea.
 

00:42:18.409 --> 00:42:23.278
So here's this burnout effect
that I showed that if you take

00:42:23.278 --> 00:42:26.625
the same coupons,
but an older one rather than

00:42:26.625 --> 00:42:30.380
a--an older one that's burned
out will always prepay slower,

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.931
so the pink one is always less
than the blue one because it

00:42:33.931 --> 00:42:36.380
went through an opportunity to
prepay.

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:39.961
So here you start with a pool
of guys on the right,

00:42:39.961 --> 00:42:43.757
and then after a while,
after time has gone down a lot

00:42:43.757 --> 00:42:45.550
of them have prepaid.
 

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:48.050
So here's alertness and cost.
 

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:53.154
So you describe a person by
what his cost of prepaying is

00:42:53.154 --> 00:42:55.159
and how alert he is.
 

00:42:55.159 --> 00:42:57.704
The more alert he is and the
lower the cost of prepaying the

00:42:57.704 --> 00:42:58.869
closer to rational he is.
 

00:42:58.869 --> 00:43:01.601
The less alert he is,
the higher the cost of

00:43:01.601 --> 00:43:04.969
prepaying the closer to the
totally dumb guy he is.

00:43:04.969 --> 00:43:07.945
And so you could have a whole
normally distributed

00:43:07.945 --> 00:43:11.650
distribution of people and over
time those groups are going to

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:14.809
be reduced because a lot of them
are prepaying,

00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:17.110
but they won't be reduce
symmetrically.

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:20.547
The low cost high alertness
guys are going to disappear much

00:43:20.547 --> 00:43:24.043
faster and the pool's going to
get more and more favorable to

00:43:24.043 --> 00:43:24.510
you.
 

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:28.213
And so anyway,
all you have to do is

00:43:28.213 --> 00:43:32.226
parameterize the cost,
what the distribution of people

00:43:32.226 --> 00:43:35.255
in the population,
what the standard deviation and

00:43:35.255 --> 00:43:38.369
expectation of cost is and of
alertness is,

00:43:38.369 --> 00:43:40.550
and that tells you what this
distribution looks like.

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:43.376
So you're fitting four numbers
and you've got thousands of

00:43:43.376 --> 00:43:45.610
pools and hundreds and hundreds
of months,

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:50.519
and fitting four parameters you
can end up fitting all the data.

00:43:50.519 --> 00:43:52.019
So look at what happens here.
 

00:43:52.019 --> 00:43:53.780
So here's the same data.
 

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:57.539
So I just tell you I know that
in a population,

00:43:57.539 --> 00:44:01.929
given what I've calculated in
the '90s there,

00:44:01.929 --> 00:44:04.820
I know what fraction of the
people have this cost and that

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.269
alertness,
what fraction of the people are

00:44:07.269 --> 00:44:10.679
so close to dumb that their
costs are astronomical and their

00:44:10.679 --> 00:44:13.882
alertness is tiny,
what fraction of the people

00:44:13.882 --> 00:44:17.320
have almost no cost and a very
high alertness,

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.518
so I'm only estimating four
parameters because I'm assuming

00:44:19.518 --> 00:44:20.579
it's normally distributed.
 

00:44:20.579 --> 00:44:24.554
Given that fixed pool of people
I apply that to the beginning of

00:44:24.554 --> 00:44:28.527
every single mortgage and I just
crank out what would those guys

00:44:28.527 --> 00:44:28.969
do.
 

00:44:28.969 --> 00:44:32.268
In the tree if they knew what
the volatilities were when would

00:44:32.268 --> 00:44:35.210
they decide to prepay,
and then I have to follow a

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:37.510
scenario out in the future and I
say,

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:40.228
"Well, along this path
which guy would prepay and which

00:44:40.228 --> 00:44:42.992
guy wouldn't prepay and what
would the total prepayments look

00:44:42.992 --> 00:44:44.190
along that path?"
 

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:47.130
And so this has generated the
pink line from the model with no

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:50.021
knowledge of the world except I
fit those parameters and look

00:44:50.021 --> 00:44:52.239
how close it is to what actually
happened.

00:44:52.239 --> 00:44:57.329
So it turns out that it was
incredibly easy to predict,

00:44:57.329 --> 00:45:00.773
contingently predict what
prepayments were going to be and

00:45:00.773 --> 00:45:03.309
therefore to be able to value
mortgages.

00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:05.389
And this was a secret that not
many people,

00:45:05.389 --> 00:45:06.789
you know, a bunch of people
understood,

00:45:06.789 --> 00:45:09.472
but not that many understood,
and so for years we were

00:45:09.472 --> 00:45:12.699
trading at our hedge fund,
first at Kidder and then at

00:45:12.699 --> 00:45:16.027
Ellington with this ability to
contingently forecast

00:45:16.027 --> 00:45:18.309
prepayments at a very high rate.
 

00:45:18.309 --> 00:45:21.005
And why was it so stable,
the prediction,

00:45:21.005 --> 00:45:22.219
and so reliable?
 

00:45:22.219 --> 00:45:24.882
It's because the class of
people stayed pretty much the

00:45:24.882 --> 00:45:27.791
same and every year there'd be
the same kinds of people with

00:45:27.791 --> 00:45:29.320
the same kinds of behavior.
 

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:30.320
Some were very alert.
 

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.065
Some were very not alert,
but the distribution of types

00:45:33.065 --> 00:45:36.016
was more or less the same and
you could predict with pretty

00:45:36.016 --> 00:45:39.119
good accuracy what was going to
happen from year to year.

00:45:39.119 --> 00:45:42.876
Of course, then after 2003 or
so the class of people started

00:45:42.876 --> 00:45:46.253
to radically change and many
more people who never got

00:45:46.253 --> 00:45:50.137
mortgages before got them and it
became much harder to predict

00:45:50.137 --> 00:45:52.239
what they were going to do.
 

00:45:52.239 --> 00:45:54.570
But so in the old days it was
pretty easy to predict.

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:55.989
And why was it so easy to
predict?

00:45:55.989 --> 00:46:03.090
Because it was an agent based
model, agent based.

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:05.427
So, by the way,
I added this volatility here,

00:46:05.427 --> 00:46:08.400
so these guys who just ran
regressions they had to have a

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.420
volatility or something
parameter.

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:14.480
So you see as volatility goes
up the prepayments are slower.

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:17.621
Well, they just had to notice
that and build it right into

00:46:17.621 --> 00:46:18.559
their function.
 

00:46:18.559 --> 00:46:20.539
I didn't even have to think of
that or burnout.

00:46:20.539 --> 00:46:23.927
None of those things did I have
to think about because if you're

00:46:23.927 --> 00:46:26.510
a guy optimizing here and
volatility goes up,

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:29.695
so you reset the tree so that
the interest rates can change

00:46:29.695 --> 00:46:30.190
faster.
 

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:32.949
The option is worth more so
you're going to wait longer.

00:46:32.949 --> 00:46:34.961
You're not going to just
exercise it right away because

00:46:34.961 --> 00:46:37.161
you've got a chance that prices
will really go up so you can

00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:39.460
wait a little longer,
afford to wait longer.

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:41.550
So prepayments will slow down.
 

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:43.389
So all I'm saying,
all of this is just to say that

00:46:43.389 --> 00:46:47.353
if you have the right--
so it's agent based,

00:46:47.353 --> 00:46:53.527
it's contingent predictions,
those two things together

00:46:53.527 --> 00:46:57.065
enable you to make quite
reliable predictions about the

00:46:57.065 --> 00:46:59.949
future if you're in a stable
environment.

00:46:59.949 --> 00:47:04.085
And so what seems like a
bewildering amount of stuff

00:47:04.085 --> 00:47:07.409
turns out to be pretty easy to
explain.

00:47:07.409 --> 00:47:11.039
So now what happens?
 

00:47:11.039 --> 00:47:16.440
So do you have any questions
here or should I--yes?

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.639
Student: You said you
assume that those two parameters

00:47:19.639 --> 00:47:21.079
are normally distributed.
 

00:47:21.079 --> 00:47:23.179
Did you select among some sort
of variance?

00:47:23.179 --> 00:47:24.199
Prof: Some sort of what?
 

00:47:24.199 --> 00:47:25.268
Student: Variance.
 

00:47:25.268 --> 00:47:27.159
Prof: I had to figure
out what the mean and the

00:47:27.159 --> 00:47:27.659
variance is.
 

00:47:27.659 --> 00:47:31.373
There's mean and variance of
cost and mean and variance of

00:47:31.373 --> 00:47:33.588
alertness to get that
distribution,

00:47:33.588 --> 00:47:34.239
right?
 

00:47:34.239 --> 00:47:40.789
So how do I know what the
population--so let me just put

00:47:40.789 --> 00:47:43.530
the picture up again.
 

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:46.369
So who are the hyper rational
guys?

00:47:46.369 --> 00:47:48.920
They are the people with the
really high alertness up there

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:51.469
and the really low cost,
so they're the guys back there.

00:47:51.469 --> 00:47:55.246
They're the hyper--or maybe it
was the guys,

00:47:55.246 --> 00:48:00.338
you know, one of these corners
with very high alertness and

00:48:00.338 --> 00:48:01.920
very low cost.
 

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.480
I forgot which way the scale
works.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.630
It might be going down.
 

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:08.315
So anyway, the guys with very
high alertness and very low

00:48:08.315 --> 00:48:10.139
costs are the hyper rational
people.

00:48:10.139 --> 00:48:13.449
At the other corner you've got
the guys who have very low

00:48:13.449 --> 00:48:15.340
alertness and very high costs.
 

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.635
They're the people who you're
going to make a lot of money on

00:48:17.635 --> 00:48:18.440
if you're the bank.
 

00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:21.550
So how do I know how many
people are of each type?

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:22.739
Well, I don't.
 

00:48:22.739 --> 00:48:26.000
I have to fit this distribution.
 

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.960
But you see I have so much data.
 

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:30.340
I've got this kind of curve.
 

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:33.934
This kind of curve I've got for
every starting year for the

00:48:33.934 --> 00:48:37.465
whole history and there's so
many different interest rates

00:48:37.465 --> 00:48:40.681
and so many different--
so I'm applying that same

00:48:40.681 --> 00:48:44.195
population at the beginning of
every single curve and then

00:48:44.195 --> 00:48:47.525
seeing what happens to my
prediction versus what really

00:48:47.525 --> 00:48:48.389
happened.
 

00:48:48.389 --> 00:48:50.648
So I've got thousands,
and thousands,

00:48:50.648 --> 00:48:54.599
and thousands of data points
and only four parameters to fit.

00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:56.940
So I pick the four parameters
to fit the data as much as

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:57.409
possible.
 

00:48:57.409 --> 00:49:01.067
If I assumed everybody was
perfectly alert instead of that

00:49:01.067 --> 00:49:04.501
curve that I showed you,
I put a huge crowd here of

00:49:04.501 --> 00:49:08.492
perfectly rational people then I
would have found that I would

00:49:08.492 --> 00:49:12.353
have gotten prepayments at 100
percent up there and at 0 all

00:49:12.353 --> 00:49:16.409
the way over here and so it
wouldn't have fit that curve.

00:49:16.409 --> 00:49:20.632
So that's how I knew that there
couldn't be that many perfectly

00:49:20.632 --> 00:49:21.860
rational people.
 

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:22.739
Yes?
 

00:49:22.739 --> 00:49:25.452
Student: How can you
know for sure that there are

00:49:25.452 --> 00:49:26.440
only two patterns?
 

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.496
Prof: You mean how do I
know cost and alertness,

00:49:28.496 --> 00:49:29.829
maybe there's some other
factors?

00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:32.719
Yes, well there probably are
other factors.

00:49:32.719 --> 00:49:36.041
So what would you
commonsensically think are the

00:49:36.041 --> 00:49:36.750
factors?
 

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:38.518
What keeps people from
prepaying?

00:49:38.518 --> 00:49:41.561
I think the most obvious one is
it's a huge hassle and they're

00:49:41.561 --> 00:49:42.710
not paying attention.
 

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:44.110
So those are the first two that
I thought of.

00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:45.530
Could you think of another one?
 

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:46.809
Student: Maybe their age.
 

00:49:46.809 --> 00:49:48.480
Prof: Their age, exactly.
 

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.880
So maybe demography has an
effect on it.

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:55.304
So maybe, for example,
you get more sophisticated the

00:49:55.304 --> 00:49:56.360
older you get.
 

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:58.929
So that was another factor we
put in.

00:49:58.929 --> 00:50:04.322
So I'm not telling you all the
factors, but these were the two

00:50:04.322 --> 00:50:05.650
main factors.
 

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:08.050
Another factor was growing
sophistication.

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:12.619
We called it the smart factor.
 

00:50:12.619 --> 00:50:14.670
That's another factor.
 

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:18.349
So over time you get more
sophisticated.

00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:23.657
So anyway, the point is with a
few of these factors you got a

00:50:23.657 --> 00:50:26.846
pretty good fit,
and it was pretty reliable,

00:50:26.846 --> 00:50:30.250
and you could predict what was
going to happen contingently.

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:36.246
So now if you want to trade
mortgages what are some of the

00:50:36.246 --> 00:50:39.719
interesting things that happen?
 

00:50:39.719 --> 00:50:44.907
The first interesting thing to
notice is that what do you think

00:50:44.907 --> 00:50:48.340
happens as the interest rate
goes down?

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:55.521
So the first thing to notice
is--so I'll just ask you two

00:50:55.521 --> 00:50:57.059
questions.
 

00:50:57.059 --> 00:50:58.369
Let's go on the other side.
 

00:50:58.369 --> 00:50:59.260
I'm running out of room.
 

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:03.313
Suppose that you have the
mortgage value,

00:51:03.313 --> 00:51:06.050
what you get in the tree?
 

00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:09.739
So in this tree that we've
built, here's the tree,

00:51:09.739 --> 00:51:13.282
it's going like that,
and at every node we're

00:51:13.282 --> 00:51:16.179
predicting--
for each class of people we're

00:51:16.179 --> 00:51:17.889
predicting where his 1s are.
 

00:51:17.889 --> 00:51:19.710
So that class is prepaying.
 

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:23.085
The other class is not as smart
so they're not prepaying here,

00:51:23.085 --> 00:51:25.797
but maybe when things get
really low they'll start

00:51:25.797 --> 00:51:26.849
prepaying here.
 

00:51:26.849 --> 00:51:30.153
So each class of people,
each cost, alertness type has

00:51:30.153 --> 00:51:31.090
its own tree.
 

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:33.094
They're the same tree,
but it's own behavior on the

00:51:33.094 --> 00:51:34.739
tree, and then I add them all
together.

00:51:34.739 --> 00:51:47.239
So what happens with the
starting interest rate?

00:51:47.239 --> 00:51:52.148
So here we had .06 and this
value was 98 or something,

00:51:52.148 --> 00:51:52.889
right?
 

00:51:52.889 --> 00:51:56.289
Now, suppose the interest rate
went down to .05.

00:51:56.289 --> 00:52:03.449
I drew this picture of interest
and mortgage value.

00:52:03.449 --> 00:52:04.809
What do you think happens?
 

00:52:04.809 --> 00:52:08.730
So the interest starts--this is
'98,6 percent is there.

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:13.596
As the interest rate goes down
what do you think happens to the

00:52:13.596 --> 00:52:15.480
value of the mortgage?
 

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:20.469
If you're a bank and you've
fixed--the mortgage rate is 8

00:52:20.469 --> 00:52:21.360
percent.
 

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.947
That's a fixed mortgage rate,
but now you've moved in the

00:52:24.947 --> 00:52:26.550
tree from here to here.
 

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:34.476
Do you think your mortgage is
going to go up in value or down

00:52:34.476 --> 00:52:35.929
in value?
 

00:52:35.929 --> 00:52:37.829
Student: It's going up.
 

00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:40.351
Prof: It's going to go
up because the interest rates

00:52:40.351 --> 00:52:42.831
are lower and the present value
of the payments is getting

00:52:42.831 --> 00:52:43.309
higher.
 

00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:46.951
So if the interest rate goes
down the mortgage is going to go

00:52:46.951 --> 00:52:48.530
up like that,
typically.

00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:50.559
But will it keep going up like
this and this?

00:52:50.559 --> 00:52:52.449
If it were a bond it would go
up like that,

00:52:52.449 --> 00:52:52.809
right?
 

00:52:52.809 --> 00:52:56.945
A bond, a 1 year bond which
owed 1 over 1 r would keep going

00:52:56.945 --> 00:52:59.889
up and up the value before it
got negative,

00:52:59.889 --> 00:53:00.449
say.
 

00:53:00.449 --> 00:53:02.179
It would go up.
 

00:53:02.179 --> 00:53:06.610
As r got negative it would go
way up like that.

00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:09.440
So does the mortgage keep going
up like that?

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:14.398
As the interest rate goes down
is the value of the mortgage

00:53:14.398 --> 00:53:18.159
going to get higher and higher
and higher?

00:53:18.159 --> 00:53:20.570
Suppose the guy's optimal,
what's going to happen?

00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:23.989
This is 100 here.
 

00:53:23.989 --> 00:53:26.840
What'll happen?
 

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:27.570
Yep?
 

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:29.070
Student: He's going to
prepay.

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:31.583
Prof: He's going to
eventually figure out that he

00:53:31.583 --> 00:53:33.320
should prepay so it'll go like
this.

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:36.309
If he's perfectly optimal he'll
never let it go above 100.

00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:38.018
So it's going to go something
like this.

00:53:38.018 --> 00:53:40.771
As the interest rate gets
higher you get crushed,

00:53:40.771 --> 00:53:44.039
and as the interest rate gets
lower you don't get the full

00:53:44.039 --> 00:53:46.389
upside because he's prepaying at
100.

00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:52.360
He's never letting it go above
100, right?

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:55.878
So if he's not so optimal maybe
your value will go up,

00:53:55.878 --> 00:53:58.070
but not so astronomically high.
 

00:53:58.070 --> 00:54:02.681
So this idea that the mortgage
curve, instead of being like

00:54:02.681 --> 00:54:06.101
this goes like that,
this is what was called

00:54:06.101 --> 00:54:07.929
negative convexity.
 

00:54:07.929 --> 00:54:16.577
Now, the next thing to know is
suppose that the guys are partly

00:54:16.577 --> 00:54:21.739
irrational so it's going above
100.

00:54:21.739 --> 00:54:25.389
So it's starting to go like
this.

00:54:25.389 --> 00:54:26.980
Then what do you think?
 

00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:33.550
As the interest gets really low
what's going to happen?

00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:34.940
All right, you just said it, so.
 

00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:37.730
If the guy was rational,
perfectly rational it would go

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:38.349
like that.
 

00:54:38.349 --> 00:54:42.070
He'd never let it go above 100,
but now suppose guys are not

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:43.268
totally rational?
 

00:54:43.268 --> 00:54:45.340
What's going to happen is
they're going to,

00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:48.001
sort of--as rates get a little
bit low they're going to

00:54:48.001 --> 00:54:50.269
overlook the fact that they
should prepay.

00:54:50.269 --> 00:54:51.750
So now it's advantageous to you.
 

00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:55.202
Things are worth more than 100,
but if rates get incredibly low

00:54:55.202 --> 00:54:58.588
even the dumbest guy,
the highest cost guy is going

00:54:58.588 --> 00:55:02.615
to realize he has an advantage
to prepay and so things are

00:55:02.615 --> 00:55:05.090
going to go back down like that.
 

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:07.469
So the value's going to be
quite complicated.

00:55:07.469 --> 00:55:10.920
So this is the mortgage value
as a function of interest rates.

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:12.489
Just common sense will tell you
this.

00:55:12.489 --> 00:55:16.356
In a typical bond as the
interest rate gets lower the

00:55:16.356 --> 00:55:18.440
present value gets higher.
 

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:21.693
You should expect a curve like
that, but because of the option

00:55:21.693 --> 00:55:25.003
if it were rationally exercised
the curve would never get above

00:55:25.003 --> 00:55:25.429
100.
 

00:55:25.429 --> 00:55:26.920
It would have to go like that.
 

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:28.885
But now if people are
irrational you can take

00:55:28.885 --> 00:55:31.300
advantage of them and get more
than 100 out of them.

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:35.063
But if the situation gets so
favorable to you it becomes

00:55:35.063 --> 00:55:37.579
blindingly obvious,
eventually to them,

00:55:37.579 --> 00:55:40.574
that they're getting screwed,
and eventually they act and

00:55:40.574 --> 00:55:42.570
bring it all the way back to 100
again.

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:44.539
So this value of the mortgage
looks like that.

00:55:44.539 --> 00:55:46.239
So that's a very tricky thing.
 

00:55:46.239 --> 00:55:50.409
I'll even write, very tricky.
 

00:55:50.409 --> 00:55:54.172
So if you don't know what
you're doing you could easily

00:55:54.172 --> 00:55:56.820
get yourself hurt holding
mortgages.

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:59.257
You could suddenly find
yourself losing money holding

00:55:59.257 --> 00:55:59.820
mortgages.
 

00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:02.219
So that's my next subject here.
 

00:56:02.219 --> 00:56:05.809
I want to talk about hedging.
 

00:56:05.809 --> 00:56:09.920
So we know something now about
valuing mortgages.

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:15.487
Now I want to talk about
hedging, and what hedge funds

00:56:15.487 --> 00:56:21.789
do, and what everyone on Wall
Street should be doing which is

00:56:21.789 --> 00:56:23.050
hedging.
 

00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:26.485
So if you hold a mortgage
you're going to hold it because

00:56:26.485 --> 00:56:30.105
maybe you can lend 100 to a
bunch of people but actually get

00:56:30.105 --> 00:56:32.130
a value that's more than 100.
 

00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:35.173
So it looks like you're here,
but if interest rates change a

00:56:35.173 --> 00:56:38.269
little bit suddenly this huge
value you thought you had might

00:56:38.269 --> 00:56:41.333
collapse back down to 100,
or the interest rates might go

00:56:41.333 --> 00:56:43.429
up and it might collapse to way
below 100.

00:56:43.429 --> 00:56:45.831
So you look like you're well
off, but there are scenarios

00:56:45.831 --> 00:56:48.320
where you could lose money and
you want to protect yourself

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:49.050
against that.
 

00:56:49.050 --> 00:56:50.309
So how do you go about doing it?
 

00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:51.550
What does hedging mean?
 

00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:56.820
And I want to put it in the
context, the old context of the

00:56:56.820 --> 00:57:00.820
World Series which we started
with before.

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:02.820
So it's easier to understand
there,

00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:05.800
and so many of you will have
thought about this before so

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:09.726
you'll be able to answer it,
but if I put it in the mortgage

00:57:09.726 --> 00:57:12.809
context it would seem just too
difficult.

00:57:12.809 --> 00:57:13.630
I don't know why I did that.
 

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:17.130
So the World Series--I'm going
to lower it in a second.

00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:21.119
So suppose that the Yankees
have a 60 percent chance,

00:57:21.119 --> 00:57:23.534
I said beating the Dodgers,
I thought the Dodgers would be

00:57:23.534 --> 00:57:26.612
in the World Series,
a 60 percent chance of winning

00:57:26.612 --> 00:57:30.190
any game against the Phillies in
the World Series.

00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:33.985
And you are a bookie and your
fellow bookies all understand

00:57:33.985 --> 00:57:35.489
that it's 60 percent.
 

00:57:35.489 --> 00:57:39.525
So some naive Philly fan comes
to you and says I want to bet

00:57:39.525 --> 00:57:43.150
100 dollars that the Phillies
win the World Series.

00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:46.550
Should you take the bet or not?
 

00:57:46.550 --> 00:57:49.034
Yes you should take the bet
because 60 percent of the time

00:57:49.034 --> 00:57:50.690
you're going to win 100
dollars--no.

00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:52.210
Yes you should take the bet.
 

00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:56.045
If he bet on one game you would
make, with 60 percent

00:57:56.045 --> 00:58:00.177
probability you'd win 100 and
with 40 percent probability

00:58:00.177 --> 00:58:01.579
you'd lose 100.
 

00:58:01.579 --> 00:58:06.679
So that means on average your
expectation is equal to 20.

00:58:06.679 --> 00:58:09.916
So if he's willing to bet 100
dollars on the Phillies winning

00:58:09.916 --> 00:58:12.130
the first game of the series
with you,

00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:15.570
you know that your expected
chance of winning is 20 dollars.

00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:19.090
You're expecting to win 20
dollars from the guy.

00:58:19.090 --> 00:58:21.541
Now, suppose he's willing to
make the same bet,

00:58:21.541 --> 00:58:23.460
100 dollars for the entire
series?

00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:31.681
What's your chance of winning
and what's your expected profit

00:58:31.681 --> 00:58:33.190
from him?
 

00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:36.150
Is it less than 20,20,
or more than 20?

00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:37.800
Student: More than 20.
 

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:39.130
Prof: More than 20.
 

00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:41.777
It's going to turn out to be,
so a 7 game series,

00:58:41.777 --> 00:58:45.197
it's going to turn out to be 42
which we're going to figure out

00:58:45.197 --> 00:58:46.079
in a second.
 

00:58:46.079 --> 00:58:48.610
But what's your risk?
 

00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:49.650
What's your risk?
 

00:58:49.650 --> 00:58:53.250
In either case you might lose
100 dollars.

00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:56.610
The Phillies,
they're probably going to lose,

00:58:56.610 --> 00:58:59.826
but there's a chance something
goes crazy and some unknown guy

00:58:59.826 --> 00:59:02.989
hits five home runs in the first
four games or something,

00:59:02.989 --> 00:59:05.846
and some other unknown guy hits
another four home runs and you

00:59:05.846 --> 00:59:06.969
lose the World Series.
 

00:59:06.969 --> 00:59:09.675
You could lose 100 dollars,
and maybe the guy's not betting

00:59:09.675 --> 00:59:12.289
100 dollars but 100 thousand
dollars or a hundred million

00:59:12.289 --> 00:59:12.849
dollars.
 

00:59:12.849 --> 00:59:15.619
You know you've got a favorable
bet, but you don't want to run

00:59:15.619 --> 00:59:18.344
the risk of losing even though
there's not that high a chance

00:59:18.344 --> 00:59:19.480
you're going to lose.
 

00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:25.030
What can you do about it?
 

00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:28.648
Well, you know that there are
these other bookies out there

00:59:28.648 --> 00:59:31.954
who every game are willing to
bet at odds 60/40 either

00:59:31.954 --> 00:59:35.760
direction on the Phillies or the
Yankees because they just all

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.250
know--
they're just like you.

00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:40.268
You all know that the odds are
60 percent for the Yankees

00:59:40.268 --> 00:59:41.400
winning every game.
 

00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:45.052
So suppose this naive guy,
the Phillies fan,

00:59:45.052 --> 00:59:50.150
comes up to you and bets 100
dollars on the World Series that

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:52.360
the Phillies will win.
 

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:54.750
You don't want to run the risk
of losing 100 dollars.

00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:58.251
You know there are these other
bookies who are willing to take

00:59:58.251 --> 01:00:00.260
bets a game at a time 60/40
odds.

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:02.400
What should you be doing?
 

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:11.909
What would you do?
 

01:00:11.909 --> 01:00:13.170
Yes?
 

01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:15.552
Student: Bet on the
Phillies winning because they

01:00:15.552 --> 01:00:17.980
give you better odds so you're
guaranteed your profit.

01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:19.090
Prof: So what would you
do?

01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:21.432
So this guy's come to you,
and you're not going to be able

01:00:21.432 --> 01:00:23.260
to give the--
we're going to find out exactly

01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:24.630
what you should do in one
second,

01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:27.626
but let's just see how far you
can get by reason without

01:00:27.626 --> 01:00:28.389
calculation.
 

01:00:28.389 --> 01:00:30.818
So this guy's come to you and
said, "I'm betting 100

01:00:30.818 --> 01:00:33.289
dollars on the Phillies winning
the World Series."

01:00:33.289 --> 01:00:36.110
This is the night before the
first game.

01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:41.231
Every bookie is standing by
ready to take bets at 30 to 20

01:00:41.231 --> 01:00:41.860
odds.
 

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:44.489
What would you do?
 

01:00:44.489 --> 01:00:47.128
Student: You'd bet with
the bookie that the Phillies

01:00:47.128 --> 01:00:48.130
would win because...
 

01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:48.820
Prof: That what?
 

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:50.260
Student: That the
Phillies would win.

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:51.230
Prof: Yeah, how much?
 

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:56.039
Student: 100 dollars.
 

01:00:56.039 --> 01:00:57.340
Prof: You'd bet the
whole 100 dollars?

01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:00.307
Student: Well,
you get better odds,

01:01:00.307 --> 01:01:00.670
so.
 

01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:02.556
Prof: But would you bet
the whole 100 dollars on the

01:01:02.556 --> 01:01:02.980
first game?
 

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:05.920
The guy's only bet 100 dollars
on the whole series.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.510
Student: You'd bet 80
&gt;

01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:09.000
dollars.
 

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.451
Prof: So it's not so
obvious what to do,

01:01:11.451 --> 01:01:13.849
right, but he's got exactly the
right idea.

01:01:13.849 --> 01:01:21.420
You can hedge your bet.
 

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:22.530
So here we are.
 

01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:27.269
I shouldn't have put that down.
 

01:01:27.269 --> 01:01:28.920
Don't tell me I turned it off.
 

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:32.880
That would just kill me.
 

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.829
God, I meant to hit mute.
 

01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:39.070
I think I hit off.
 

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:40.510
Oh, how dumb?
 

01:01:40.510 --> 01:01:52.460
So you would bet on the--while
that warms up.

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:56.429
I can see it.
 

01:01:56.429 --> 01:02:00.579
All right, so what happens is
you'll have a tree which looks

01:02:00.579 --> 01:02:04.588
like this and like this,
like this and like this,

01:02:04.588 --> 01:02:09.686
like this and like this and
let's say we go out a few games

01:02:09.686 --> 01:02:10.829
like this.
 

01:02:10.829 --> 01:02:14.480
Now, this is a 1,2,
3 game series.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.289
All right, so I've done it.
 

01:02:15.289 --> 01:02:18.710
Here's the start of World
Series.

01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:21.349
This is the World Series
spreadsheet you had before.

01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:23.159
Now, here's the start.
 

01:02:23.159 --> 01:02:29.099
Here's game 1,2, 3,4, 5,6, 7.
 

01:02:29.099 --> 01:02:39.389
So if the Yankees win the
series they get 100 dollars.

01:02:39.389 --> 01:02:42.039
You get 100 dollars, sorry.
 

01:02:42.039 --> 01:02:51.190
Oh, what an idiot.
 

01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:54.985
So every time you end up above
the start, win more than you

01:02:54.985 --> 01:02:56.820
lose, you get 100 dollars.
 

01:02:56.820 --> 01:03:01.144
On the other hand,
if you lose more than you win

01:03:01.144 --> 01:03:04.181
you lose 100 dollars,
and so ctrl,

01:03:04.181 --> 01:03:05.010
copy.
 

01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:10.489
Here is losing 100 dollars.
 

01:03:10.489 --> 01:03:12.744
So now this tree,
remember from doing it before,

01:03:12.744 --> 01:03:14.280
is just by backward induction.
 

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:18.800
If you look at this thing up
there it says you get,

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:24.043
60 percent I think was the
number we figured out over here,

01:03:24.043 --> 01:03:25.219
so right?
 

01:03:25.219 --> 01:03:27.804
So 60 percent is the
probability of the Yankees

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:28.760
winning a game.
 

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:35.469
So you take any node like this
one you're always taking 60

01:03:35.469 --> 01:03:42.059
percent of the value up here
plus 40 percent of the value

01:03:42.059 --> 01:03:43.119
here.
 

01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:47.155
So if you do that you find out
that the value to you is 42

01:03:47.155 --> 01:03:49.210
dollars, just what we said.
 

01:03:49.210 --> 01:03:52.420
So let's put that in the middle
of the screen.

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:55.340
So the value is 42 dollars.
 

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:59.724
Now, if the Yankees win the
first game you're in much better

01:03:59.724 --> 01:04:00.320
shape.
 

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:04.130
So winning the first game means
you moved up to this node here.

01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:13.559
All of a sudden you went from
42 dollars to 64 dollars.

01:04:13.559 --> 01:04:18.706
And if the Yankees lost the
first game you would have gone

01:04:18.706 --> 01:04:22.768
down to that value which is like
9 dollars.

01:04:22.768 --> 01:04:25.420
Your expected winnings when the
Yankees are down a game,

01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:27.639
you know, they're still a
better team so actually it's

01:04:27.639 --> 01:04:30.150
more likely even after losing
the first game that the Yankees

01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:31.449
would still win the series.
 

01:04:31.449 --> 01:04:34.324
So you see the risk that you're
running and you can calculate

01:04:34.324 --> 01:04:34.659
this.
 

01:04:34.659 --> 01:04:37.829
So what should you do in the
very first game?

01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:41.639
This tells you that your
expected winnings is 42.

01:04:41.639 --> 01:04:50.360
Of course .6 times 64 that's
38.4 .4 times 9 is 3.6.

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.650
That is 42 dollars.
 

01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:56.606
So that's 42 because it's the
average of this and this,

01:04:56.606 --> 01:05:00.489
and 64 is the average of .6 of
this and .4 of that.

01:05:00.489 --> 01:05:04.010
So what should you do?
 

01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:06.820
Well, on average you're going
to make 42 dollars.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.380
What's the essence of hedging?
 

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:11.380
You want to guarantee that you
make 42 dollars no matter what

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:11.880
happens.
 

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:15.414
No matter who wins the series
you want to end up with 42 extra

01:05:15.414 --> 01:05:18.893
dollars assuming the interest
rate is 0 from the beginning to

01:05:18.893 --> 01:05:20.400
the end of the series.
 

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.150
So how can you arrange that?
 

01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:29.360
What can you do?
 

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.750
Well, so that's the mystery.
 

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:34.239
I'll give you one second to try
and think it through.

01:05:34.239 --> 01:05:36.250
You should get this.
 

01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:45.929
What would you do here?
 

01:05:45.929 --> 01:05:51.110
Are there no baseball bookies
in the--yep?

01:05:51.110 --> 01:05:54.347
Student: Didn't we just
bring this up before like with

01:05:54.347 --> 01:05:55.320
our hedge funds?
 

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.822
Can we put something else aside
that you view at a percentage

01:05:58.822 --> 01:06:02.266
rate that you think you can
trust and then you can trust the

01:06:02.266 --> 01:06:05.420
rest of it to whatever the real
probabilities are?

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:07.559
Prof: Well,
you can bet with another bookie

01:06:07.559 --> 01:06:08.389
at 60 to 40 odds.
 

01:06:08.389 --> 01:06:11.630
If the Yankees win the first
game you're just doing great.

01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:15.972
If the Yankees lose the first
game you're looking to be in a

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.739
little bit of trouble.
 

01:06:17.739 --> 01:06:20.161
So the point is you're not
going to get the payoffs until

01:06:20.161 --> 01:06:22.110
the very end either plus 100 or
minus 100,

01:06:22.110 --> 01:06:24.704
but already by the first game
you're either doing better than

01:06:24.704 --> 01:06:26.780
you were before or worse than
you were before.

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:28.893
You're already,
in effect, suffering some risk

01:06:28.893 --> 01:06:30.018
at the very beginning.
 

01:06:30.018 --> 01:06:33.010
So this is one of the great
ideas of finance.

01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:36.210
You shouldn't hedge the final
outcome.

01:06:36.210 --> 01:06:38.230
You should hedge next day's
outcome.

01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:40.679
If you're marking to market
that's what you'd have to do.

01:06:40.679 --> 01:06:44.248
Marking to market you'd have to
say my position now--my bet is

01:06:44.248 --> 01:06:45.360
worth 64 dollars.
 

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:48.065
The Yankees lost the first
game, the bet would be worth 9

01:06:48.065 --> 01:06:48.550
dollars.
 

01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:50.579
So what does it mean to protect
yourself?

01:06:50.579 --> 01:06:53.041
Not just protect yourself
against what's happening at the

01:06:53.041 --> 01:06:54.864
end,
that's really what you want to

01:06:54.864 --> 01:06:57.893
do, but in order to do that you
should protect yourself every

01:06:57.893 --> 01:06:59.559
day against what could happen.
 

01:06:59.559 --> 01:07:02.594
So every day you should end up
with 42 here and 42 there

01:07:02.594 --> 01:07:05.186
because, after all,
that's what you're trying to

01:07:05.186 --> 01:07:05.849
lock in.
 

01:07:05.849 --> 01:07:09.106
No matter who wins the first
game you should still say I'm 42

01:07:09.106 --> 01:07:12.039
dollars ahead because I got
myself in this position.

01:07:12.039 --> 01:07:13.829
So how could you do that?
 

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:22.489
Well, let's bet at 3 to 2 odds,
right, 60/40 is 3 to 2 odds.

01:07:22.489 --> 01:07:29.159
Let's make a bet with another
bookie at 22 and 33 here.

01:07:29.159 --> 01:07:31.599
So 22--I put it in the wrong
place.

01:07:31.599 --> 01:07:38.360
This is the 33 and this is 22,
but plus 33 and minus 22.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:39.869
So what are you doing here?
 

01:07:39.869 --> 01:07:42.880
Notice that this is 2 times 11,
this is 3 times 11.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.349
This is 60/40 odds.
 

01:07:44.349 --> 01:07:46.880
I'm betting on the Phillies.
 

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:49.860
If the Phillies win one game I
collect 33 dollars.

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:51.719
That's what I should do that he
said.

01:07:51.719 --> 01:07:54.862
He said, "Go to the bookie
across the street and bet on one

01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:56.309
game, not the whole series.
 

01:07:56.309 --> 01:08:00.860
Bet on one game with that
bookie across the street,

01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:04.230
33 dollars versus 22
dollars."

01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:06.550
Let's say you can only bet 1
game at a time with the other

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:08.161
bookies,
actually, maybe you were saying

01:08:08.161 --> 01:08:09.510
all along bet on the whole
series,

01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:12.382
but let's say you can only bet
one game at a time with the

01:08:12.382 --> 01:08:13.190
other bookies.
 

01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:16.710
You'd bet 33 dollars on the
Phillies in the first game.

01:08:16.710 --> 01:08:21.078
That naive Philly fan has put
up 100 dollars on the series.

01:08:21.078 --> 01:08:24.569
You're, in the first game,
going to put 33 dollars.

01:08:24.569 --> 01:08:27.106
You've taken his bet so you're
hoping the Yankees win,

01:08:27.106 --> 01:08:29.979
but that's bad to be in a
position where you have to hope.

01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:31.130
You don't want to do that.
 

01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:34.731
So you take his bet on the
Phillies because he's given you

01:08:34.731 --> 01:08:35.868
100 to 100 odds.
 

01:08:35.868 --> 01:08:38.337
That's even odds even though
you know the Yankees have a 60

01:08:38.337 --> 01:08:39.529
percent change of winning.
 

01:08:39.529 --> 01:08:43.082
You go to the bookie across the
street and you bet at 60/40 odds

01:08:43.082 --> 01:08:45.507
on the Phillies,
but you don't bet the whole

01:08:45.507 --> 01:08:45.960
100.
 

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.908
You only bet 33 dollars of it.
 

01:08:47.908 --> 01:08:49.859
So if you win you get 33
dollars.

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:52.279
If you lose you only have to
pay the guy 22.

01:08:52.279 --> 01:08:54.010
So what's going to happen?
 

01:08:54.010 --> 01:08:58.421
After the first day this
position is going to be worth 42

01:08:58.421 --> 01:09:02.046
and this position is also going
to be worth 42,

01:09:02.046 --> 01:09:04.408
exactly where you started.
 

01:09:04.408 --> 01:09:09.018
So because a win in the first
game is going to put you so far

01:09:09.018 --> 01:09:13.319
ahead in your bet with the first
naive Philly better,

01:09:13.319 --> 01:09:16.368
and a loss in the first game is
going to put you so far behind,

01:09:16.368 --> 01:09:22.537
you hedge that possibility by
going 33/22 in favor of the

01:09:22.537 --> 01:09:23.750
Phillies.
 

01:09:23.750 --> 01:09:27.108
You take a big bet on the
Yankees and then you make a

01:09:27.108 --> 01:09:31.177
smaller bet on the Phillies that
cancels out part of the big bet

01:09:31.177 --> 01:09:34.077
on the Yankees,
but you've made the two at

01:09:34.077 --> 01:09:37.478
different odds and so on net
you're still going to be 42

01:09:37.478 --> 01:09:38.529
dollars ahead.
 

01:09:38.529 --> 01:09:42.328
Let's just pause for a second
and see if you got that.

01:09:42.328 --> 01:09:45.960
So by doing this you can't
possibly lose any money.

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:49.260
And now you're going to repeat
this bet down here and here.

01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:54.479
So in the next--you see where
do things go next?

01:09:54.479 --> 01:09:57.050
Here you're down 8 dollars.
 

01:09:57.050 --> 01:10:00.020
If you lost again you'd be down
32 dollars.

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:01.340
Now things would really be bad.
 

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:05.354
After the Yankees lost two
games in a row your original bet

01:10:05.354 --> 01:10:08.400
would look terrible,
but things aren't so bad

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.239
because you bet on the Phillies
here.

01:10:11.239 --> 01:10:14.140
You already made 33 dollars.
 

01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:19.975
So how much money do you think
you should be betting on the

01:10:19.975 --> 01:10:22.090
Phillies down here?
 

01:10:22.090 --> 01:10:26.108
Well, you want to lock in 42
dollars at every node no matter

01:10:26.108 --> 01:10:27.130
what happens.
 

01:10:27.130 --> 01:10:29.923
This 42 dollars,
by making the right offsetting

01:10:29.923 --> 01:10:33.408
bet you can keep 42 everywhere,
here until the very end,

01:10:33.408 --> 01:10:36.899
and so no matter what happened
you can always end up with 42

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:37.550
dollars.
 

01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:39.350
That's the essence of hedging.
 

01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:42.529
So let's just say it again what
the idea is.

01:10:42.529 --> 01:10:44.859
It's a great idea and we don't
have time to go through all the

01:10:44.859 --> 01:10:46.310
details, but the great idea is
this.

01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:49.239
You've made some gigantic bet
with somebody.

01:10:49.239 --> 01:10:51.020
Why do you bet with anybody?
 

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:52.738
Because you think you know more
than they do.

01:10:52.738 --> 01:10:55.789
The whole essence of trading
and finance is you think you

01:10:55.789 --> 01:10:58.460
understand the world better than
somebody else.

01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:01.671
So understand it means you
think something's going to turn

01:11:01.671 --> 01:11:05.109
out one way that the other guy
doesn't really know is going to

01:11:05.109 --> 01:11:05.729
happen.
 

01:11:05.729 --> 01:11:11.038
So you're making a bet on
whether you're right or wrong.

01:11:11.038 --> 01:11:13.319
So when you say you know you
don't know for sure.

01:11:13.319 --> 01:11:16.252
You just have a better idea
than he does,

01:11:16.252 --> 01:11:20.359
so you want to use your idea
without running the risk.

01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:21.529
So how can you do it?
 

01:11:21.529 --> 01:11:26.131
If your idea is really correct
there may be a way so that you

01:11:26.131 --> 01:11:28.050
can eliminate the luck.
 

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:31.180
So here if you really know the
odds are 60/40,

01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:34.060
your class of bookies knows the
odds are 60/40,

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:36.891
and some other guys who doesn't
know thinks the odds are 50/50

01:11:36.891 --> 01:11:38.609
and is willing to bet against
you,

01:11:38.609 --> 01:11:42.399
you can lock in your 42 dollars
for sure.

01:11:42.399 --> 01:11:45.930
You don't just take a bet and
hope you win.

01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:49.814
You can take a bet and then
hedge it to lock in your profit

01:11:49.814 --> 01:11:51.390
for sure,
step by step,

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:54.835
and that's what we have to
explain how that dynamic hedging

01:11:54.835 --> 01:11:55.369
works.
 

01:11:55.369 --> 01:12:05.100
So I have to stop.
 

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:10.000

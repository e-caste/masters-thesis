00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.773
Professor Paul Bloom:
So, most of what we do these

00:00:14.773 --> 00:00:16.172
days – our methods,
our theories,

00:00:16.172 --> 00:00:17.818
our ideas – are shaped,
to some extent,

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:21.001
by Piaget's influence.
And so, what I want to do is

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:25.643
begin this class that's going to
talk about cognitive development

00:00:25.643 --> 00:00:29.696
by talking about his ideas.
His idea was that children are

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.425
active thinkers;
they're trying to figure out

00:00:32.425 --> 00:00:34.807
the world.
He often described them as

00:00:34.807 --> 00:00:37.900
little scientists.
And incidentally,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.470
to know where he's coming from
on this, he had a very dramatic

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.257
and ambitious goal.
He didn't start off because he

00:00:48.257 --> 00:00:51.171
was interested in children.
He started off because he was

00:00:51.171 --> 00:00:54.080
interested in the emergence of
knowledge in general.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.591
It was a discipline he
described as genetic

00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:01.270
epistemology – the origins of
knowledge.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.510
But he studied development of
the individual child because he

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.427
was convinced that this
development will tell him about

00:01:07.427 --> 00:01:10.019
the development of knowledge
more generally.

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:13.026
There's a very snooty phrase
that--I don't know if you ever

00:01:13.026 --> 00:01:15.349
heard it before.
It's a great phrase.

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:19.340
It's "Ontogeny recapitulates
phylogeny."

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.995
And the idea of this--What that
means is that development of an

00:01:23.995 --> 00:01:28.349
individual mimics or repeats
development of the species.

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:32.519
Now, it's entirely not true,
but it's a beautiful phrase and

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:35.566
Piaget was committed to this.
He was very interested in

00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:37.816
saying, "Look.
We'll figure how a kid develops

00:01:37.816 --> 00:01:41.176
and that will tell us about the
development of knowledge more

00:01:41.176 --> 00:01:44.173
generally."
So, Piaget viewed the child as

00:01:44.173 --> 00:01:47.418
a scientist who developed this
understanding,

00:01:47.418 --> 00:01:49.410
these schemas,
these little,

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.140
miniature theories of the
world.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.083
And they did this through two
sorts of mechanisms:

00:01:56.083 --> 00:02:01.296
assimilation and accommodation.
So, assimilation would be the

00:02:01.296 --> 00:02:06.409
act of expanding the range of
things that you respond to.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.593
Piaget's example would be a
baby who's used to sucking on a

00:02:10.593 --> 00:02:14.560
breast might come to suck on a
bottle or on a rattle.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.300
That's changing the scope of
things that you respond to.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.729
Accommodation is changing how
you do it.

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:26.766
A baby will form his mouth
differently depending on what

00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:29.984
he's sucking on.
And so, these processes where

00:02:29.984 --> 00:02:34.050
you take in--I'm giving this in
a very physical way,

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.322
but in a more psychological
sense you have a way of looking

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:38.552
at the world.
You could expand it to

00:02:38.552 --> 00:02:41.240
encompass new things,
assimilation.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.376
But you could also change your
system of knowledge itself –

00:02:45.376 --> 00:02:48.515
accommodation.
And Piaget argued that these

00:02:48.515 --> 00:02:52.803
two mechanisms of learning drove
the child through different

00:02:52.803 --> 00:02:55.150
stages.
And he had a stage theory,

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.890
which was quite different from
the Freudian stage theory that

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.813
we have been introduced to.
So his methods were to ask

00:03:02.813 --> 00:03:07.080
children to solve problems and
to ask them questions.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.978
And his discoveries that--they
did them in different ways at

00:03:10.978 --> 00:03:14.810
different ages led to the
emergence of the Stage Theory.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.193
So, for Piaget,
the first stage is the

00:03:19.193 --> 00:03:24.879
sensorimotor stage or the
sensorimotor period.

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:31.030
For here the child is purely a
physical creature.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.609
The child has no understanding
in any real way of the external

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.184
world.
There's no understanding of the

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:41.368
past, no understanding of the
future, no stability,

00:03:41.368 --> 00:03:45.560
no differentiation.
The child just touches and

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.780
sees, but doesn't yet reason.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.063
And it's through this stage
that a child gradually comes to

00:03:56.063 --> 00:03:57.760
acquire object permanence.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.052
Object permanence is the
understanding that things exist

00:04:05.052 --> 00:04:09.973
when you no longer see them.
So those of you in front,

00:04:09.973 --> 00:04:14.364
you're looking at me and I go.
It occurred to me it'd be a

00:04:14.364 --> 00:04:16.280
great magic trick if I then
appeared in back.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.759
But no, I'm just here.
That's object permanence.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:23.162
If I went under here and then
the people said,

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:27.759
"Where the hell did he go?
Class is over," that would show

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:31.762
a lack of object permanence.
So, adults have object

00:04:31.762 --> 00:04:35.573
permanence.
Piaget's very interesting claim

00:04:35.573 --> 00:04:39.075
is that kids don't.
Before six-month-olds,

00:04:39.075 --> 00:04:42.197
Piaget observed,
you take an object the kid

00:04:42.197 --> 00:04:44.576
likes like a rattle,
you hide it,

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:48.589
you put it behind something,
it's like it's gone.

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:52.149
And he claimed the child really
thinks it's just gone.

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:55.612
Things don't continue to exist
when I'm not looking at them

00:04:55.612 --> 00:04:58.678
anymore.
And so he noticed they--they're

00:04:58.678 --> 00:05:01.872
surprised by peek-a-boo.
And Piaget's claim was one

00:05:01.872 --> 00:05:04.694
reason why they're surprised at
peek-a-boo is you go--you look

00:05:04.694 --> 00:05:06.285
at a kid,
the kid's smiling and go,

00:05:06.285 --> 00:05:08.562
"Oh, peek-a-boo," and you
close--and you cover your face

00:05:08.562 --> 00:05:10.590
and the kid says,
"He's gone."

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.750
"Peek-a-boo."
"Oh, there he is.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.999
He's gone."
And you really--That's the

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:20.798
claim.
Piaget also discovered that

00:05:20.798 --> 00:05:25.419
older children fail at a task
that's known as the A-not-B

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.484
task.
And Peter Gray in his

00:05:27.484 --> 00:05:31.698
psychology textbook refers to it
as the "changing hiding places"

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:35.110
problem, which is probably a
better name for it.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.187
And here's the idea.
You take a nine-month-old and

00:05:38.187 --> 00:05:41.782
for Piaget a nine-month-old is
just starting to make sense of

00:05:41.782 --> 00:05:46.031
objects and their permanence.
You take an object and you put

00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:49.372
it here in a cup where the kid
can't see it,

00:05:49.372 --> 00:05:52.314
but it's in the cup.
So the kid, if you were the

00:05:52.314 --> 00:05:55.580
kid, will reach for it.
You do it again, reach for it.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.879
You do it again, reach for it.
That's point A.

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:01.009
Then you take--you move it over
here.

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:03.970
Piaget observed kids would
still reach for this.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.770
It's like they're not smart
enough to figure out that it's

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.029
not there anymore,
even if they see it move.

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:13.365
And this was more evidence that
they just don't understand

00:06:13.365 --> 00:06:17.929
objects, and that this thing
takes a lot of time and learning

00:06:17.929 --> 00:06:20.554
to develop.
The next stage is the

00:06:20.554 --> 00:06:24.480
preoperational stage.
The child starts off grasping

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.139
the world only in a physical
way, in a sensorimotor way,

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.996
but when he gets to the
preoperational period the

00:06:31.996 --> 00:06:36.077
capacity to represent the world,
to have the world inside your

00:06:36.077 --> 00:06:40.061
head, comes into being.
But it's limited and it's

00:06:40.061 --> 00:06:43.529
limited in a couple of striking
ways.

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:48.610
One way in which it's limited
is that children are egocentric.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.090
Now, egocentrism has a meaning
in common English which means to

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.379
be selfish.
Piaget meant it in a more

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:58.038
technical way.
He claimed that children at

00:06:58.038 --> 00:07:01.734
this age literally can't
understand that others can see

00:07:01.734 --> 00:07:06.395
the world differently from them.
So, one of his demonstrations

00:07:06.395 --> 00:07:09.788
was the three mountains task.
We have three mountains over

00:07:09.788 --> 00:07:11.865
there.
You put a child on one side of

00:07:11.865 --> 00:07:15.192
the mountains and you ask him to
draw it, and a four- or

00:07:15.192 --> 00:07:19.358
five-year-old can do it easily,
but then you ask him to draw it

00:07:19.358 --> 00:07:23.098
as it would appear from the
other side and children find

00:07:23.098 --> 00:07:27.794
this extraordinarily difficult.
They find it very difficult to

00:07:27.794 --> 00:07:31.610
grasp the world as another
person might see it.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:36.797
Another significant finding
Piaget had about this phase of

00:07:36.797 --> 00:07:41.529
development concerns what's
called "conservation."

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:46.635
The notion of conservation is
that there's ways to transform

00:07:46.635 --> 00:07:51.914
things such that some aspects of
them change but others remain

00:07:51.914 --> 00:07:54.646
the same.
So, for instance,

00:07:54.646 --> 00:07:59.936
if you take a glass of water
and you pour it into another

00:07:59.936 --> 00:08:04.261
glass that's shallow or tall,
it won't change the amount of

00:08:04.261 --> 00:08:06.472
water you have.
If you take a bunch of pennies

00:08:06.472 --> 00:08:09.110
and you spread them out,
you don't get more pennies.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.924
But kids, according to Piaget,
don't know that and this is one

00:08:12.924 --> 00:08:16.725
of the real cool demonstrations.
Any of you who have access to a

00:08:16.725 --> 00:08:18.509
four- or five-year-old,
[laughter]

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:21.860
a sibling or something--Do not
take one without permission,

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.177
but if you have access to a
four- or five-year-old you can

00:08:24.177 --> 00:08:26.220
do this yourself.
This is what it looks like.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.111
The first one has no sound.
The second one is going to be

00:08:29.111 --> 00:08:31.069
sound that's going to come on at
the end.

00:08:31.069 --> 00:08:33.059
But there's two rows of
checkers.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:37.370
She asks the kid which one has
more.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:43.162
The kid says they're the same.
Then she says--Now she asks him

00:08:43.162 --> 00:08:47.310
which one has more,
that or that.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.601
So that's really stupid.
And it's an amazing finding

00:08:51.601 --> 00:08:55.120
kids will do that and it's a
robust finding.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.490
Here's another example.
So, they're the same.

00:09:07.529 --> 00:09:11.919
So, it's a cool finding of that
stage, suggesting a limitation

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:15.230
in how you deal and make sense
of the world.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.426
The next phase,
concrete operations,

00:09:17.426 --> 00:09:20.626
from seven to twelve,
you can solve the conservation

00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:23.439
problem,
but still you're limited to the

00:09:23.439 --> 00:09:26.429
extent you're capable of
abstract reasoning.

00:09:26.429 --> 00:09:31.085
So the mathematical notions of
infinity or logical notions like

00:09:31.085 --> 00:09:34.990
logical entailment are beyond a
child of this age.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.370
The child is able to do a lot,
but still it's to some extent

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.641
stuck in the concrete world.
And then finally,

00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:45.929
at around age twelve,
you could get abstract and

00:09:45.929 --> 00:09:50.163
scientific reasoning.
And this is the Piagetian

00:09:50.163 --> 00:09:56.141
theory in very brief form.
Now, Piaget fared a lot better

00:09:56.141 --> 00:10:02.049
than did Freud or Skinner for
several reasons.

00:10:02.049 --> 00:10:05.230
One reason is these are
interesting and falsifiable

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.948
claims about child development.
So claims that--about the

00:10:08.948 --> 00:10:12.702
failure of conservation in
children at different ages could

00:10:12.702 --> 00:10:15.679
be easily tested and
systematically tested,

00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:18.250
and in fact,
there's a lot of support for

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.377
them.
Piaget had a rich theoretical

00:10:20.377 --> 00:10:23.558
framework, pulling together all
sorts of observations in

00:10:23.558 --> 00:10:25.976
different ways,
wrote many, many books and

00:10:25.976 --> 00:10:28.570
articles and articulated his
theory very richly.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.740
And most of all,
I think, he had some really

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.618
striking findings.
Before Piaget,

00:10:32.618 --> 00:10:35.350
nobody noticed these
conservation findings.

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:38.355
Before Piaget,
nobody noticed that babies had

00:10:38.355 --> 00:10:41.769
this problem tracking and
understanding objects.

00:10:41.769 --> 00:10:44.990
At the same time,
however, there are limitations

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:49.343
in Piaget's theory.
Some of these limitations are

00:10:49.343 --> 00:10:52.418
theoretical.
It's an interesting question as

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:55.899
to whether he really explains
how a child goes from a concrete

00:10:55.899 --> 00:10:59.629
thinker to an abstract thinker,
or how he goes from not having

00:10:59.629 --> 00:11:02.850
object permanence to
understanding object permanence.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.519
There's methodological
limitations.

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:08.095
Piaget was really big into
question and answer,

00:11:08.095 --> 00:11:11.342
but one problem with this is
that children aren't very good

00:11:11.342 --> 00:11:13.936
with language,
and this might lead you to

00:11:13.936 --> 00:11:16.009
underestimate how much they
know.

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:20.230
And this is particularly a
problem the younger you get.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:24.493
Methodology is going to loom
heavy in the discussion of any

00:11:24.493 --> 00:11:27.360
science and that includes
psychology.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:32.045
Often 90% of the game is
discovering a clever method

00:11:32.045 --> 00:11:35.720
through which to test your
hypotheses.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.429
We're going to talk a little
bit about that regarding babies.

00:11:38.429 --> 00:11:41.049
I'll give you another example
from a very different domain.

00:11:41.049 --> 00:11:45.970
There was a set of scientists
interested in studying tickling.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:49.196
So, when you tickle somebody,
under what circumstances will

00:11:49.196 --> 00:11:51.106
they laugh?
Where do you have to tickle

00:11:51.106 --> 00:11:52.610
them?
Can you tickle yourself?

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.179
Does it have to be a surprise,
and so on?

00:11:55.179 --> 00:11:58.149
It turns out very difficult to
study this in a lab.

00:11:58.149 --> 00:11:59.529
You're not going to have your
experimental credit.

00:11:59.529 --> 00:12:00.660
You come into the lab and say,
"Okay.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.190
I'm the graduate student.
Ha, ha, ha."

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.305
And [laughter]
in fact, an example of a

00:12:05.305 --> 00:12:08.756
methodological attempt was done
by Henry Gleitman at University

00:12:08.756 --> 00:12:11.751
of Pennsylvania,
who built a tickle machine,

00:12:11.751 --> 00:12:15.514
which was this box with these
two giant hands that went

00:12:15.514 --> 00:12:17.829
"r-r-r-r."
This was a failure because

00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:20.540
people could not go near the
tickle machine without

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.521
convulsing in laughter.
But we will discuss when we

00:12:24.521 --> 00:12:29.950
have a lecture on laughter a bit
of the tickle sciences.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.887
And finally there's factual.
What do infants and children

00:12:33.887 --> 00:12:36.748
really know?
It's possible that due to the

00:12:36.748 --> 00:12:40.730
methodological limitations of
Piaget, he systematically

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:44.269
underestimated what children and
babies know.

00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:46.461
And in fact,
I'll present some evidence

00:12:46.461 --> 00:12:49.750
suggesting that this is in
fact--that this is the case.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:54.555
So, I want to introduce you to
the modern science of infant

00:12:54.555 --> 00:12:57.115
cognition.
Infant cognition has been

00:12:57.115 --> 00:12:59.620
something studied for a very
long time.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.308
And there was a certain view
that has had behind it a

00:13:03.308 --> 00:13:07.210
tremendous philosophical and
psychological consensus.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:11.710
And it's summarized in this
Onion headline here.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:17.068
And the idea is that babies are
stupid, that babies really don't

00:13:17.068 --> 00:13:20.855
know much about the world.
Now, the work that this

00:13:20.855 --> 00:13:23.787
Onion headline is
satirizing is the recent

00:13:23.787 --> 00:13:26.227
studies,
which I'm going to talk about,

00:13:26.227 --> 00:13:29.704
suggested that on the contrary,
babies might be smarter than

00:13:29.704 --> 00:13:31.773
you think.
And to discover the

00:13:31.773 --> 00:13:35.958
intelligence of babies we have
to ourselves be pretty smart in

00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:39.705
developing different techniques.
To study what a baby knows,

00:13:39.705 --> 00:13:43.610
you can't ask your questions.
Babies can't talk.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.638
You could look at what it does
but babies are not very

00:13:46.638 --> 00:13:50.009
coordinated or skilled so you
need to use clever methods.

00:13:50.009 --> 00:13:55.399
One clever method is to look at
their brain waves [laughter].

00:13:55.399 --> 00:13:58.919
This child on the right died
during testing.

00:13:58.919 --> 00:14:01.042
It was a tragic--It was crushed
by the weights [laughter]

00:14:01.042 --> 00:14:03.450
of the electrodes.
He's happy though.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.169
You could study their brain
waves.

00:14:06.169 --> 00:14:09.423
One of the few things babies
can do is they could suck on a

00:14:09.423 --> 00:14:10.867
pacifier.
And you might think,

00:14:10.867 --> 00:14:12.769
well, how could you learn
anything from that?

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:15.569
Well, for instance,
you could build machines that

00:14:15.569 --> 00:14:18.951
when babies suck on a pacifier
they hear music or they hear

00:14:18.951 --> 00:14:21.610
language,
and then you could look at how

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:25.409
much they suck on the pacifier
to determine what they like.

00:14:25.409 --> 00:14:29.910
But undeniably we know most of
our--we got most of our

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:35.090
knowledge about babies from
studies of their looking times.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:39.659
That's one thing babies can do.
They can look.

00:14:39.659 --> 00:14:42.906
And I have up here--This is a
picture of Elizabeth Spelke,

00:14:42.906 --> 00:14:45.981
who is a developmental
psychologist who's developed the

00:14:45.981 --> 00:14:49.227
most research on looking at
babies' looking times and what

00:14:49.227 --> 00:14:52.491
you could learn from them.
And I have here two ways you

00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:55.870
could learn from looking.
One is preference.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.236
So for instance,
suppose you want to know,

00:14:58.236 --> 00:15:00.948
for whatever reason,
do babies like the looks of

00:15:00.948 --> 00:15:03.859
dogs or cats?
Well, you could put a baby

00:15:03.859 --> 00:15:08.236
down, have a picture of a dog
here, a picture of a cat here,

00:15:08.236 --> 00:15:11.129
and see which one the baby
looks at.

00:15:11.129 --> 00:15:14.409
Babies can move their eyes and
that could tell you something.

00:15:14.409 --> 00:15:18.129
Do babies distinguish pretty
faces from ugly faces?

00:15:18.129 --> 00:15:20.650
Well, put a pretty face here,
an ugly face here,

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:23.440
see if the baby prefers to look
at the pretty one.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.480
You could also do habituation
and surprise.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.457
And much of the studies I'm
going to talk about here involve

00:15:31.457 --> 00:15:35.524
habituation and surprise.
Habituation is a fancy word for

00:15:35.524 --> 00:15:38.267
boredom.
What you do is you show a baby

00:15:38.267 --> 00:15:42.393
something over and over again.
Now, remember from behaviorism

00:15:42.393 --> 00:15:45.830
the baby will learn this isn't
very interesting.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.450
Then you show the baby
something different.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:52.124
If the baby really sees it as
different, the baby will look

00:15:52.124 --> 00:15:56.052
longer, and you could use that
as a measure of what babies find

00:15:56.052 --> 00:15:57.605
different.
For instance,

00:15:57.605 --> 00:16:00.779
suppose you want to know if the
baby can tell green from red.

00:16:00.779 --> 00:16:03.438
Well, you could show the baby a
green patch, a green patch,

00:16:03.438 --> 00:16:04.860
a green patch,
a green patch;

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.210
the baby'll get bored,
then a red patch.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:10.730
If they all look the same to
the baby, the baby will just

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:13.935
continue to tune out,
but if the red looks different

00:16:13.935 --> 00:16:16.456
the baby will perk up.
And this is,

00:16:16.456 --> 00:16:20.300
in fact, one way they study
color vision in babies.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:25.105
Surprise is related to this.
You could show babies something

00:16:25.105 --> 00:16:28.802
that shouldn't happen.
If babies are like--If babies

00:16:28.802 --> 00:16:32.110
also think it shouldn't happen,
they might look longer,

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:36.344
and essentially what happens is
scientists do magic tricks to

00:16:36.344 --> 00:16:39.850
explore this very thing.
And to start with some real

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.500
examples, a lot of this infant
research has gone back to the

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.159
Piagetian question of object
permanence,

00:16:46.159 --> 00:16:51.067
asking, "Is it really true
babies don't know that objects

00:16:51.067 --> 00:16:54.659
remain even when they're out of
sight?"

00:16:54.659 --> 00:16:59.118
So one very simple study by
Spelke and Baillargeon:

00:16:59.118 --> 00:17:04.557
Have babies shown a block with
a bar going back and forth like

00:17:04.557 --> 00:17:07.099
that.
So the bar just goes back and

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:09.244
forth.
Now, there's something you do

00:17:09.244 --> 00:17:13.049
that's so obvious you probably
don't even know you're doing it.

00:17:13.049 --> 00:17:15.829
When you see a display like
that, what you assume is there's

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:18.608
a bar there, and what that means
is there's something in the

00:17:18.608 --> 00:17:20.539
middle that you've never seen
before.

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:23.390
But of course,
if you were a simple perceptual

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:27.190
creature, you would just see
that there'd be a bar on top and

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.654
a bar on the bottom.
You wouldn't expect anything in

00:17:29.654 --> 00:17:31.390
the middle because you never saw
anything in the middle.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:35.213
So, what you do then is you
show babies this and then you

00:17:35.213 --> 00:17:39.036
show them either B or C and if
we do this with adults you

00:17:39.036 --> 00:17:42.165
expect B, C is almost a joke.
And, in fact,

00:17:42.165 --> 00:17:46.049
babies respond the same way.
Babies expect there to be an

00:17:46.049 --> 00:17:50.185
entire, complete bar and are
surprised and look longer at the

00:17:50.185 --> 00:17:52.153
broken bar.
Other studies,

00:17:52.153 --> 00:17:55.520
some of them--Well,
here's another study by Rene

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.819
Baillargeon looking at the same
thing in a different way.

00:17:59.819 --> 00:18:03.631
You show the baby,
say a six-month-old,

00:18:03.631 --> 00:18:08.273
a stage with a block on it.
Then a screen rises and

00:18:08.273 --> 00:18:12.261
obscures the block.
Now, if the babies expect the

00:18:12.261 --> 00:18:16.625
block to still be there,
they should think the block

00:18:16.625 --> 00:18:19.822
should stop the screen.
On the other hand,

00:18:19.822 --> 00:18:22.901
if out of sight out of mind,
they should expect the screen

00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:25.523
to keep going.
So, what you do is you set up a

00:18:25.523 --> 00:18:28.380
couple of displays,
one where the block is stopped,

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.968
the other one where you take
this away with a trap door and

00:18:31.968 --> 00:18:34.235
it keeps going.
And, as you see,

00:18:34.235 --> 00:18:36.970
the baby screams when this
happens.

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:41.230
That doesn't really happen,
but they do look longer.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:44.339
One final example of an object
permanence study.

00:18:44.339 --> 00:18:48.053
Some of this work's been done
at Yale in Karen Wynn's lab,

00:18:48.053 --> 00:18:51.637
where they look at babies'
understanding of addition and

00:18:51.637 --> 00:18:54.062
subtraction.
And a lot of it is done with

00:18:54.062 --> 00:18:55.937
real objects,
but there's also animated

00:18:55.937 --> 00:18:58.060
versions so here is an animated
example.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:27.813
Babies are surprised.
They expect 2 - 1 = 1 and when

00:19:27.813 --> 00:19:31.394
2 - 1 = 2 or 3 or 0,
they look longer,

00:19:31.394 --> 00:19:35.390
indicating surprise.
And even six-month-olds are

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.799
sensitive to these rudimentary
facts of arithmetic,

00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:41.377
telling us something about
their mathematical knowledge,

00:19:41.377 --> 00:19:44.236
but also telling us something
about that they expect things to

00:19:44.236 --> 00:19:45.970
remain when they're out of
sight.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:50.678
Now, this research suggests
that infants' understanding of

00:19:50.678 --> 00:19:54.560
the physical world is there from
the very start,

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.700
but at the same time not
entirely.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.290
We know there are certain
things babies don't know.

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:04.789
Here's an example.
Suppose you show babies this.

00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:07.936
You have a block here and then
you have something above there

00:20:07.936 --> 00:20:11.829
floating in mid air.
Babies find this surprising.

00:20:11.829 --> 00:20:14.069
Even six-month-olds find this
surprising.

00:20:14.069 --> 00:20:18.289
It violates gravity,
but six-month-olds aren't smart

00:20:18.289 --> 00:20:22.839
enough to know that a block just
stuck over here is also

00:20:22.839 --> 00:20:25.474
surprising.
Twelve-month-olds will think

00:20:25.474 --> 00:20:27.884
that it should fall.
Six-month-olds don't,

00:20:27.884 --> 00:20:31.849
and even 12-month-olds don't
find anything weird about this,

00:20:31.849 --> 00:20:36.329
while adults are sophisticated
enough to understand that that's

00:20:36.329 --> 00:20:39.869
an unstable configuration and
should fall over.

00:20:39.869 --> 00:20:44.589
So, although some things are
built in, some things develop.

00:20:44.589 --> 00:20:47.482
And this raises the question
of, "How do we explain

00:20:47.482 --> 00:20:50.373
development?"
How do we explain when babies

00:20:50.373 --> 00:20:54.140
come to know things that they
didn't originally know?

00:20:54.140 --> 00:21:00.839
Well, one answer is neural
maturation, growth of the brain.

00:21:00.839 --> 00:21:04.517
Most of the neurons you have
now in your head,

00:21:04.517 --> 00:21:09.339
right now, you had when you
were in your mother's uterus.

00:21:09.339 --> 00:21:12.143
What happens in development
isn't for the most part the

00:21:12.143 --> 00:21:15.289
growth of new neurons.
It's for the most part pruning,

00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:18.320
getting rid of neurons.
So, the neural structures

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.004
change radically as babies kind
of get rid of excess neurons

00:21:22.004 --> 00:21:25.238
through development.
At the same time though,

00:21:25.238 --> 00:21:29.435
connections between neurons
grow like crazy and they--and

00:21:29.435 --> 00:21:34.082
this process of synaptic growth
where there are the connections

00:21:34.082 --> 00:21:38.279
across different synapses peaks
at about two years.

00:21:38.279 --> 00:21:41.276
Finally, remember myelination,
where you sort of get this

00:21:41.276 --> 00:21:44.380
fatty sheath over your neuron to
make it more effective?

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.694
That also happens through
development, and in fact,

00:21:47.694 --> 00:21:51.605
it goes through development and
even teenagers are not fully

00:21:51.605 --> 00:21:53.373
myelinated.
In particular,

00:21:53.373 --> 00:21:56.299
they're not fully myelinated in
their frontal lobes.

00:21:56.299 --> 00:22:00.793
Recall that frontal lobes are
involved in things like

00:22:00.793 --> 00:22:04.921
restraint and willpower.
And so, it could be the problem

00:22:04.921 --> 00:22:07.410
is the baby's brain doesn't
develop yet.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:12.349
Another possibility is there's
problems with inhibition.

00:22:12.349 --> 00:22:15.372
This is related,
again, to the frontal lobes and

00:22:15.372 --> 00:22:18.009
this comes out with the A,
not B error.

00:22:18.009 --> 00:22:22.690
So, remember the baby reaches,
reaches, reaches.

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:27.340
It's moved, reach,
follow, keeps reaching the same

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.232
place.
And it could be that babies

00:22:29.232 --> 00:22:30.700
don't know anything about
objects.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.948
But another possibility is once
you do something it's kind of

00:22:33.948 --> 00:22:36.472
hard to stop.
It takes a bit of control to

00:22:36.472 --> 00:22:38.071
stop.
And there's all sorts of

00:22:38.071 --> 00:22:40.740
independent evidence that babies
lack this control.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:45.839
The part of their brain that
could control certain behaviors

00:22:45.839 --> 00:22:49.136
is just not active yet.
There's a very nice

00:22:49.136 --> 00:22:52.247
illustration of inhibitory
problems from a "Simpsons"

00:22:52.247 --> 00:22:55.777
episode that actually sort of
covers anything you might want

00:22:55.777 --> 00:22:58.470
to know about developmental
differences.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.033
And that basically may sum up
much of developmental

00:23:04.033 --> 00:23:08.250
psychology.
That the child essentially--he

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.770
does A, A, A.
It's moved.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.569
You go, "doh!"
and he keeps going for it.

00:23:13.569 --> 00:23:15.700
And there's some evidence
that's true.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.871
Adele Diamond who studies this
finds that although kids reach

00:23:19.871 --> 00:23:23.630
for A, they look for B,
as if they know it's there but

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.460
they can't stop themselves from
reaching.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.799
And we'll continue this theme a
little bit later.

00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:32.730
Finally, it might be kids don't
know things.

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:36.700
Some things you've got to learn.
And this is true in all sorts

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.730
of domains – in the social
world, in the economic world,

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:43.057
in the political world – and
it's true as well in the

00:23:43.057 --> 00:23:45.712
physical world.
In fact, there's some things

00:23:45.712 --> 00:23:49.366
even adults don't know.
So, here's a study by Michael

00:23:49.366 --> 00:23:54.180
McCloskey with college students.
Here's the idea.

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:58.342
You have a tube,
a transparent--a tube--a hollow

00:23:58.342 --> 00:24:03.833
tube, and at the top of the tube
you throw a ball through so it

00:24:03.833 --> 00:24:07.730
whips through the tube and it
comes out.

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:09.809
The question is,
"What happens to it?"

00:24:09.809 --> 00:24:15.509
Does it go in the path of A,
or does it go in the path of B?

00:24:15.509 --> 00:24:18.810
Without looking around,
who votes for A?

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:22.869
Who votes for B?
Here's the weird thing.

00:24:22.869 --> 00:24:26.608
Whenever I do this at Yale
everybody gets the damn thing

00:24:26.608 --> 00:24:29.808
right [laughter].
At Johns Hopkins,

00:24:29.808 --> 00:24:33.290
50/50, [laughter]
for A and B.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:37.741
I got to get a better demo.
But anyway, college students

00:24:37.741 --> 00:24:42.929
not here, show systematic biases
of incorrect physical

00:24:42.929 --> 00:24:45.391
intuitions.
Here's a twist,

00:24:45.391 --> 00:24:49.394
and if you found people who
were less wonderful than you

00:24:49.394 --> 00:24:53.979
all, and asked them you'd get a
lot of people saying the curving

00:24:53.979 --> 00:24:55.789
thing.
But here's a twist.

00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:58.491
Ask somebody,
"What if you took a tube and

00:24:58.491 --> 00:25:02.400
you squirted water through it?
Where would the water go?"

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.698
Nobody chooses B.
Everybody knows the water would

00:25:05.698 --> 00:25:08.783
continue in a straight line,
suggesting that when you have

00:25:08.783 --> 00:25:12.250
experience that helps you out,
but in absence of experience

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:16.030
you're kind of lost.
We've talked about the physical

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.130
world.
What about the social world?

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:21.614
What about the world of people?
Well, there's a lot of research

00:25:21.614 --> 00:25:24.184
on this as well.
Babies start off with some

00:25:24.184 --> 00:25:26.634
social preferences.
If you take newborn

00:25:26.634 --> 00:25:30.035
babies--It's very hard to do
research with newborn babies

00:25:30.035 --> 00:25:33.680
actually because of the consent
procedure and everything,

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.271
so most of this work is done in
France [laughter],

00:25:37.271 --> 00:25:40.697
where they have no laws at all.
They just rush in to--Women

00:25:40.697 --> 00:25:42.488
give birth and they rush in and
they say, "We are

00:25:42.488 --> 00:25:44.885
psychologists,"
and then we do experiments on

00:25:44.885 --> 00:25:49.577
the babies, and it's terrific.
And this is one of them where

00:25:49.577 --> 00:25:54.390
they compare babies looking at
this versus this.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:57.300
Babies like the one that looks
like a face.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:01.000
These are newborns.
There are some preferences with

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.079
humans and with other primates
to favor faces.

00:26:04.079 --> 00:26:08.450
Babies are also social animals
too, so they're natural mimics.

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.372
Andrew Meltzoff,
for instance,

00:26:10.372 --> 00:26:13.155
has found that if you go to a
newborn baby,

00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:16.999
and if you find a newborn baby,
this is the first thing you

00:26:16.999 --> 00:26:19.979
should do.
Stick your face right up to the

00:26:19.979 --> 00:26:23.509
newborn baby and go like this
and stick your tongue out.

00:26:23.509 --> 00:26:28.443
And Meltzoff finds that babies
more often than not stick their

00:26:28.443 --> 00:26:31.714
tongues out back,
suggesting some sort of social

00:26:31.714 --> 00:26:34.895
connection from one person to
another, and then later on

00:26:34.895 --> 00:26:38.406
babies are mimics.
Babies more often than not will

00:26:38.406 --> 00:26:42.895
copy the face next to them.
Now, these--the nature of these

00:26:42.895 --> 00:26:47.259
responses, this preferring
faces, this sort of mimicry,

00:26:47.259 --> 00:26:49.917
is a matter of debate,
and there's a lot of research

00:26:49.917 --> 00:26:51.950
going on asking how smart are
babies.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:55.813
Can we see--use some of the
same methods that we've looked

00:26:55.813 --> 00:26:59.609
at for the physical world to
look at the social world?

00:26:59.609 --> 00:27:02.984
And to illustrate one of the
studies, I'll tell you about a

00:27:02.984 --> 00:27:06.299
study that I did with Valerie
Kuhlmeier and Karen Wynn.

00:27:06.299 --> 00:27:08.819
And so, what we tested was
nine-month-olds and

00:27:08.819 --> 00:27:11.450
twelve-month-olds,
and we showed them movies.

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:14.144
So, they're sitting down and
they're seeing a movie where one

00:27:14.144 --> 00:27:16.390
character's going to help a ball
achieve a goal,

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:18.400
and another character's going
to hinder the ball.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.184
And then we're going to see
whether they expect the ball to

00:27:22.184 --> 00:27:26.490
approach the one that helped it
versus the one that hindered it.

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:30.069
So, this is what a baby would
see.

00:27:30.069 --> 00:27:32.900
This is literally the same
movie a baby would see in the

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.194
experiment.
The thing is for these sorts of

00:27:35.194 --> 00:27:38.287
experiments there is a lot of
control, so something that's a

00:27:38.287 --> 00:27:41.380
square in one movie will be a
triangle in another movie;

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.407
something that's on the top in
one movie will be on the bottom

00:27:44.407 --> 00:27:46.532
in another movie.
So, this is an example movie

00:27:46.532 --> 00:27:48.010
but this is what babies would
see.

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:08.010
And they'd see this over and
over again and the question is

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:11.671
would they expect babies--would
babies expect the one to

00:28:11.671 --> 00:28:15.331
approach the one that helped it
or approach the one that

00:28:15.331 --> 00:28:17.616
hindered it?
And what we find is,

00:28:17.616 --> 00:28:20.061
statistically,
babies look longer when shown a

00:28:20.061 --> 00:28:23.104
movie where it approaches the
one that hindered it versus

00:28:23.104 --> 00:28:26.775
helped it.
And this we take as preliminary

00:28:26.775 --> 00:28:31.289
evidence that they have a social
interpretation.

00:28:31.289 --> 00:28:34.095
They see this movie as you see
this movie in terms of helping

00:28:34.095 --> 00:28:36.153
and hindering,
and somebody going to somebody

00:28:36.153 --> 00:28:37.930
that helped it versus hindered
it.

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:41.799
You could then ask--This makes
a prediction that babies should

00:28:41.799 --> 00:28:45.415
themselves prefer the creature
who's the helper versus the

00:28:45.415 --> 00:28:47.408
hinderer,
and to explore this,

00:28:47.408 --> 00:28:50.387
a graduate student in this
department, Kiley Hamlin,

00:28:50.387 --> 00:28:53.483
has started a series of studies
where they show babies

00:28:53.483 --> 00:28:56.813
three-dimensional scenes and
then give them the characters

00:28:56.813 --> 00:28:59.150
and see which one they reach
for.

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:01.810
So, here's video so you could
see how this experiment is done.

00:30:01.849 --> 00:30:04.079
Now, the next trial is from a
different study.

00:30:04.079 --> 00:30:08.269
A different thing we use,
and the baby is given a choice.

00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:11.495
One thing to know
methodologically is the person

00:30:11.495 --> 00:30:14.240
giving a choice is blind to the
study.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.682
And blind here is a technical
term meaning she had no idea

00:30:17.682 --> 00:30:20.637
what the baby saw,
and the point about this is to

00:30:20.637 --> 00:30:24.016
avoid either intentional or
unintentional sort of trying to

00:30:24.016 --> 00:30:26.882
get the answer you want.
She couldn't do that because

00:30:26.882 --> 00:30:28.819
she didn't know what the right
answer is.

00:30:28.819 --> 00:30:29.410
So, here's what the baby would
see.

00:30:40.569 --> 00:30:47.524
So, this suggests that some
social understanding may be

00:30:47.524 --> 00:30:52.939
there from the very start.
This evidence is tentative,

00:30:52.939 --> 00:30:57.016
very controversial.
But now, I want to raise a huge

00:30:57.016 --> 00:31:02.313
developmental puzzle and the
puzzle is there are some ways in

00:31:02.313 --> 00:31:05.579
which babies are--not just
babies,

00:31:05.579 --> 00:31:10.336
but young children are very
clueless when it comes to

00:31:10.336 --> 00:31:13.178
people.
And so, I have a film clip here

00:31:13.178 --> 00:31:16.824
of two very nice studies showing
babies' ignorant--sorry,

00:31:16.824 --> 00:31:19.819
young children's ignorance of
other people.

00:31:19.819 --> 00:31:26.161
I'll show you the studies and
then we'll briefly discuss what

00:31:26.161 --> 00:31:28.944
they mean.
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:31:28.944 --> 00:31:32.080
Before discussing that example
in a little bit more detail,

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.910
any questions?
What are your questions?

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:36.551
Yes, in back.
Student: [inaudible]

00:31:36.551 --> 00:31:39.346
Professor Paul Bloom:
Typically--I don't know for

00:31:39.346 --> 00:31:42.860
those particular children,
but typically on those tasks

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:46.869
three-year-olds and young
four-year-olds tend to fail,

00:31:46.869 --> 00:31:50.490
and around the age of four or
five kids tend to succeed.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:53.465
There's sort of a period around
the age of four,

00:31:53.465 --> 00:31:56.377
four and a half,
where kids make the transition

00:31:56.377 --> 00:31:58.765
from failure to success.
The question,

00:31:58.765 --> 00:32:01.178
by the way, was when do
children--in that video when

00:32:01.178 --> 00:32:04.112
were the--what were the ages of
the children who failed and who

00:32:04.112 --> 00:32:04.680
passed?

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:13.855
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

00:32:13.855 --> 00:32:19.231
Professor Paul Bloom:
The question of whether

00:32:19.231 --> 00:32:25.660
discriminant conditioning has
been used with babies to explore

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:31.180
what sort of concepts they have.
I don't know.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.041
Does anybody--It has been--
Graduate Student:

00:32:34.041 --> 00:32:37.014
--It's not as effective--
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:32:37.014 --> 00:32:40.324
Koleen answered and said that
it's not as effective as other

00:32:40.324 --> 00:32:42.945
methods.
Part of the problem with using

00:32:42.945 --> 00:32:46.861
operant conditioning with babies
is it's difficult to get them to

00:32:46.861 --> 00:32:51.889
behave in any systematic way.
So, the looking-time measures

00:32:51.889 --> 00:32:56.100
tend to be more subtle.
Any other questions?

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:03.700
Oh.
Yes.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:09.786
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:33:09.786 --> 00:33:11.644
Oh.
The question of why they

00:33:11.644 --> 00:33:14.958
chose--the baby--the kids chose
the rocket ship one as opposed

00:33:14.958 --> 00:33:17.455
to the Rafael one.
It wasn't what they were

00:33:17.455 --> 00:33:20.974
interested in in the experiment.
And my bet is when they chose

00:33:20.974 --> 00:33:23.714
the stickers they had a pretty
good sense of why,

00:33:23.714 --> 00:33:26.910
of which ones the boys would
prefer in those studies.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:30.593
The question of why a boy might
prefer one sort of sticker,

00:33:30.593 --> 00:33:33.960
and you might get a different
response with a girl,

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.935
is going to come up later when
we discuss different theories of

00:33:36.935 --> 00:33:38.822
sex differences.
But that was something I think

00:33:38.822 --> 00:33:40.970
they were just assuming in the
study to get it off the ground.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:48.820
Okay.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:58.230
There's a huge debate over
what's going on there.

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:02.013
And if you listened at the end
to the psychologist summarizing

00:34:02.013 --> 00:34:05.735
the data, the psychologist had a
very good and very clear and

00:34:05.735 --> 00:34:08.030
strong idea of what was going
on.

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:11.230
It was that children need to
know more about minds.

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:15.886
The children don't know about
that you can do something with

00:34:15.886 --> 00:34:19.816
the intent to deceive.
They don't understand that

00:34:19.816 --> 00:34:24.280
somebody could choose what you
chose in a malicious way.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:29.935
This is possible.
This is one respectable theory,

00:34:29.935 --> 00:34:34.154
but the alternative is they
have the right knowledge,

00:34:34.154 --> 00:34:38.130
but they suffer from problems
with inhibition.

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:40.679
So, consider both studies.
The first study,

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:43.682
the one with the deceptive
dolls with the big shoes and

00:34:43.682 --> 00:34:46.239
little shoes,
is actually fairly difficult.

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:50.445
And it's possible that children
kind of got overwhelmed with it,

00:34:50.445 --> 00:34:53.449
and when asked what would the
mother think,

00:34:53.449 --> 00:34:56.290
who the mother would think
stole the food,

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:59.269
responded with who really stole
the food.

00:34:59.269 --> 00:35:02.371
And that there's some pull
towards the right answer that

00:35:02.371 --> 00:35:06.047
makes this task difficult.
The second one--the second

00:35:06.047 --> 00:35:09.920
study illustrates this issue
even more clearly.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.053
Take the boy who kept failing.
He kept pointing to the rocket

00:35:14.053 --> 00:35:16.969
ship and mean monkey kept taking
it away.

00:35:16.969 --> 00:35:20.839
It's possible that he genuinely
didn't know what to do,

00:35:20.839 --> 00:35:24.995
that he wasn't smart enough to
understand that he needed to

00:35:24.995 --> 00:35:28.820
point to the other one.
But it's also possible that

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:32.460
it's a Homer Simpson-like
effect, where when asked to

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:36.233
point to what he wants,
he just couldn't help but point

00:35:36.233 --> 00:35:40.002
to the one he wanted.
And that the extra work it

00:35:40.002 --> 00:35:45.151
takes to lie was beyond him.
And, in support of the second

00:35:45.151 --> 00:35:50.304
alternative, even adults find
these tasks involving lying and

00:35:50.304 --> 00:35:53.960
deception more difficult.
They were slower at them.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:58.992
We make more mistakes than
tasks that don't involve lying

00:35:58.992 --> 00:36:01.914
and deception.
So, I'm raising this not to

00:36:01.914 --> 00:36:04.799
solve the problem.
You'll read more about it in

00:36:04.799 --> 00:36:08.806
the Peter Gray textbook and more
about it in The Norton

00:36:08.806 --> 00:36:12.885
readings on development,
but just to raise this as an

00:36:12.885 --> 00:36:17.614
interesting area of debate.
Another interesting area of

00:36:17.614 --> 00:36:22.284
debate is, "What's the
relationship between different

00:36:22.284 --> 00:36:27.525
sorts of development?"
So, I started off with Piaget,

00:36:27.525 --> 00:36:31.818
and Piaget, like Freud,
believed in general,

00:36:31.818 --> 00:36:36.809
across the board changes in how
children think.

00:36:36.809 --> 00:36:39.841
An alternative,
though, is that there's

00:36:39.841 --> 00:36:43.750
separate modules,
and this is a view developed,

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:47.331
again, by Noam Chomsky,
and also by the philosopher of

00:36:47.331 --> 00:36:50.575
mind Jerry Fodor,
who claimed that the whole idea

00:36:50.575 --> 00:36:54.360
of a child developing as a
single story is mistaken.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:58.866
What you get instead is there
are separate pre-wired systems

00:36:58.866 --> 00:37:02.981
for reasoning about the world.
These systems have some

00:37:02.981 --> 00:37:06.107
built-in knowledge,
and they have to do some

00:37:06.107 --> 00:37:09.268
learning,
but the learning pattern varies

00:37:09.268 --> 00:37:13.550
from system to system and
there's a separateness to them.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:15.829
Why should we take this view
seriously?

00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:20.077
Well, one reason is that there
are developmental disorders that

00:37:20.077 --> 00:37:24.050
seem to involve damage to one
system but not to another.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:27.650
And the classic case of this is
a disorder known as autism.

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:31.285
And autism is something I've
always found a fascinating

00:37:31.285 --> 00:37:34.644
disorder for many reasons.
It's actually why I entered

00:37:34.644 --> 00:37:37.098
psychology.
I started off working with

00:37:37.098 --> 00:37:40.522
children with autism.
And it could be taken as a

00:37:40.522 --> 00:37:44.913
striking illustration of how the
social part of your brain is

00:37:44.913 --> 00:37:48.059
distinct from other parts of
your brain.

00:37:48.059 --> 00:37:51.900
So, what autism is is a
disorder that strikes about one

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.460
in a thousand people,
mostly boys.

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:59.439
And the dominant problems
concern--consist of a lack of

00:37:59.439 --> 00:38:02.944
social connectedness,
problems with language,

00:38:02.944 --> 00:38:05.833
problems dealing with people,
and more generally,

00:38:05.833 --> 00:38:08.119
a problem of what the
psychologist,

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:12.010
Simon Baron-Cohen has described
as "mind blindness."

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:15.146
In that autistic people show no
impairments dealing with the

00:38:15.146 --> 00:38:17.626
physical world,
they show no impairments

00:38:17.626 --> 00:38:21.700
on--they don't necessarily show
any impairments on mathematical

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:25.477
skills or spatial skills,
but they have a lot of problems

00:38:25.477 --> 00:38:28.791
with people.
Now, many autistic children

00:38:28.791 --> 00:38:31.963
have no language;
they're totally shut off from

00:38:31.963 --> 00:38:33.727
society.
But even some of them who'd

00:38:33.727 --> 00:38:36.755
learned language and who managed
to get some sort of independent

00:38:36.755 --> 00:38:39.489
life,
nevertheless will suffer from a

00:38:39.489 --> 00:38:42.840
severe social impairment.
And this could be shown in all

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:45.617
sorts of ways.
A simple experiment developed

00:38:45.617 --> 00:38:48.280
by Simon Baron-Cohen goes like
this.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.440
You show this to three- and
four-year-olds.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.882
There's four candies there,
and you say,

00:38:52.882 --> 00:38:56.654
"This is Charlie in the middle.
Which chocolate will Charlie

00:38:56.654 --> 00:38:59.128
take?"
For most children and most of

00:38:59.128 --> 00:39:02.659
you, I hope, the answer's pretty
clear: This one.

00:39:02.659 --> 00:39:05.685
Autistic children will often
just shrug, say,

00:39:05.685 --> 00:39:08.268
"How could I know?"
because they don't

00:39:08.268 --> 00:39:11.998
instinctively appreciate that
people's interests and desires

00:39:11.998 --> 00:39:14.969
tend to be attuned to where
they're looking.

00:39:14.969 --> 00:39:18.043
Another sort of task,
which is a task that's been

00:39:18.043 --> 00:39:20.668
done hundreds,
perhaps thousands of times,

00:39:20.668 --> 00:39:24.510
is known as "the false-belief
task" and here's the idea.

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:28.730
You show the child the
following situation.

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:34.054
There's a doll named Maxie and
Maxie puts the ball in the

00:39:34.054 --> 00:39:38.171
cupboard.
Maxie leaves and a second doll

00:39:38.171 --> 00:39:41.471
enters.
The second doll takes the ball

00:39:41.471 --> 00:39:45.360
out of the cupboard and puts it
under the bed.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:49.557
Maxie comes back and the
question is, "Where will Maxie

00:39:49.557 --> 00:39:53.429
look for the ball?"
Now, this is a question about

00:39:53.429 --> 00:39:58.000
your understanding about minds.
The question of where is the

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.900
ball really is a question about
the physical world.

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:05.619
Everyone can solve it,
but this question is hard.

00:40:05.619 --> 00:40:09.888
The right answer is Max
will--Maxie will look in the

00:40:09.888 --> 00:40:15.077
cupboard, even though it's not
really there because Maxie has a

00:40:15.077 --> 00:40:19.409
false belief about the world.
Three-year-olds find this

00:40:19.409 --> 00:40:21.371
difficult.
Two-year-olds find this

00:40:21.371 --> 00:40:23.045
difficult.
Four-year-olds and

00:40:23.045 --> 00:40:25.590
five-year-olds are able to pass
this task.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:28.010
Normal adults are able to pass
this task.

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:30.739
Children with autism have
serious problems.

00:40:30.739 --> 00:40:34.006
And often, people with autism
who are otherwise very high

00:40:34.006 --> 00:40:36.514
functioning will fail this task.
They'll say,

00:40:36.514 --> 00:40:38.873
"Oh, he must think it's
not--He'll--He's going to check

00:40:38.873 --> 00:40:43.690
under the bed."
Any questions about autism?

00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:52.423
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

00:40:52.423 --> 00:40:57.140
Professor Paul Bloom:
Good question.

00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:00.119
It isn't.
They're both experiments

00:41:00.119 --> 00:41:03.550
designed to tap an appreciation
of false belief.

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:07.196
The deception one with the
shoes and everything looked at

00:41:07.196 --> 00:41:10.864
it in the course of deception.
Can you understand that the

00:41:10.864 --> 00:41:14.269
mother might think it's that
person even though it's really

00:41:14.269 --> 00:41:16.489
that person?
And our kid failed.

00:41:16.489 --> 00:41:22.175
This is a sort of stripped-down
version without all the

00:41:22.175 --> 00:41:27.230
fanciness but it tests exactly
the same thing.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:30.666
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

00:41:30.666 --> 00:41:33.136
Professor Paul Bloom:
Nobody knows,

00:41:33.136 --> 00:41:36.510
but there's a theory which
won't answer your question but

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:38.920
will put it into a broader
context.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:42.785
Simon Baron-Cohen argues that
there are certain abilities that

00:41:42.785 --> 00:41:45.320
tend to be more sequestered for
males,

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.089
and other abilities that are
more sequestered,

00:41:48.089 --> 00:41:51.060
more focused on females.
Social abilities,

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:54.690
he argues, tend to be more
female than male.

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:57.543
So, the way Baron puts it,
provocatively,

00:41:57.543 --> 00:42:01.680
is to be a man is to suffer
from a very mild form of autism

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.853
[laughter].
The idea is then that autistic

00:42:04.853 --> 00:42:08.989
individuals suffer from what he
calls extreme male brains,

00:42:08.989 --> 00:42:11.459
and as such,
it stands to reason that they'd

00:42:11.459 --> 00:42:14.618
be more sampled from the male
population than the female

00:42:14.618 --> 00:42:16.922
population.
That's such an interesting

00:42:16.922 --> 00:42:19.474
issue, that again,
when we return to talk about

00:42:19.474 --> 00:42:22.858
sex differences we'll look at
that in a little bit more detail

00:42:22.858 --> 00:42:25.410
to see if it's supported by the
evidence.

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:30.552
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

00:42:30.552 --> 00:42:36.170
Professor Paul Bloom:
I'm sorry.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:41.328
Tell me the--Is the severity of
autism… Student:

00:42:41.328 --> 00:42:44.920
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:49.062
It's an interesting question.
The question is,

00:42:49.062 --> 00:42:52.990
"How do you think about the
severity of autism with regard

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:57.069
to developmental stages?"
And sort of surprisingly,

00:42:57.069 --> 00:43:01.110
autism can't really be thought
of in that way.

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:04.678
So, it's not like an adult with
autism is like a three-year-old

00:43:04.678 --> 00:43:06.688
or a two-year-old.
In some ways,

00:43:06.688 --> 00:43:09.858
somebody with autism isn't like
any child at all,

00:43:09.858 --> 00:43:12.500
any normally developing child
at all.

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:16.462
So, it's not really a
developmental delay in the way

00:43:16.462 --> 00:43:20.736
that it might make sense to
think about certain forms of

00:43:20.736 --> 00:43:22.897
retardation.
On the other hand,

00:43:22.897 --> 00:43:25.954
when we think about how severe
autism is we do look at things

00:43:25.954 --> 00:43:28.349
like how much language does the
person have,

00:43:28.349 --> 00:43:32.750
and in that sense,
it is related to development.

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:34.789
Yes.
Student:

00:43:34.789 --> 00:43:37.772
What are the chances that
someone who's autistic would be

00:43:37.772 --> 00:43:39.849
able to overcome their
deficiencies?

00:43:39.849 --> 00:43:42.110
Professor Paul Bloom:
The majority of people with

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:43.309
autism.
It's a good question.

00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:45.642
The question is,
"What are the chances that

00:43:45.642 --> 00:43:48.420
somebody with autism will be
able to overcome their

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.947
deficiencies?"
Autism is a funny disorder in

00:43:50.947 --> 00:43:53.476
that there's a lot of media
publication and media

00:43:53.476 --> 00:43:55.665
presentation.
Often the people who are

00:43:55.665 --> 00:43:58.579
showcased in the media tend to
be very exceptional.

00:43:58.579 --> 00:44:00.597
So, there's a woman,
Temple Grandin,

00:44:00.597 --> 00:44:04.230
who's autistic and--Has anybody
here heard of Temple Grandin?

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:07.475
She wrote some wonderful books
about her experience as an

00:44:07.475 --> 00:44:09.909
autistic person,
but she's very unusual.

00:44:09.909 --> 00:44:12.522
So a lot depends,
to answer your question,

00:44:12.522 --> 00:44:15.518
how one defines autism,
and whether one includes

00:44:15.518 --> 00:44:18.531
Asperger syndrome,
which is a limited,

00:44:18.531 --> 00:44:22.179
a more mild syndrome,
as a form of autism.

00:44:22.179 --> 00:44:25.587
The answer is that the majority
of people with autism have

00:44:25.587 --> 00:44:27.500
severe problems,
and will not,

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:30.469
and at this stage,
with this level of therapy,

00:44:30.469 --> 00:44:33.664
will not lead a normal life.
Student:

00:44:33.664 --> 00:44:36.499
More specifically,
what I meant was,

00:44:36.499 --> 00:44:41.358
when you showed the example of
Rain Man, ere they exceptional

00:44:41.358 --> 00:44:44.517
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:44:44.517 --> 00:44:48.189
Right.
The question is about so-called

00:44:48.189 --> 00:44:50.395
autistic savants.
So, Rain Man,

00:44:50.395 --> 00:44:53.348
the character played by Dustin
Hoffman, had extraordinary

00:44:53.348 --> 00:44:56.851
mathematical abilities.
And some people with autism

00:44:56.851 --> 00:45:00.958
have extraordinary artistic
abilities or mathematical

00:45:00.958 --> 00:45:05.380
abilities or musical abilities
and these are amazing.

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:09.455
It's an amazing question why
they have it but this is a very

00:45:09.455 --> 00:45:11.706
small minority.
This is a very--It's

00:45:11.706 --> 00:45:15.042
fascinating that it happens at
all, that you have severe damage

00:45:15.042 --> 00:45:17.409
but compensated with some
powerful skill.

00:45:17.409 --> 00:45:20.590
Now, I know I'm answering your
question I think in a better

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:22.510
way, but it's actually very
rare.

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:24.909
Most people with autism do not
have any exceptional abilities

00:45:24.909 --> 00:45:25.870
that go along with it.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:37.018
Another question is if you
believe in modules--If there are

00:45:37.018 --> 00:45:41.396
modules, what are they?
And so far when reviewing the

00:45:41.396 --> 00:45:45.125
developmental data we've talked
about two of them:

00:45:45.125 --> 00:45:49.261
physics and people.
An object module and a social

00:45:49.261 --> 00:45:51.453
module.
But other people have argued

00:45:51.453 --> 00:45:54.697
that there is a special module
in your brain for dealing with

00:45:54.697 --> 00:45:57.366
artifacts,
that is, things like tables and

00:45:57.366 --> 00:46:01.171
chairs and cars and forks.
Some people have argued there's

00:46:01.171 --> 00:46:04.748
a module for sociology,
for dealing with human groups,

00:46:04.748 --> 00:46:08.578
races and classes and so on.
Some have even argued that

00:46:08.578 --> 00:46:12.257
there is an intuitive biology,
a common-sense biological

00:46:12.257 --> 00:46:15.667
understanding of the world
that's separate from your

00:46:15.667 --> 00:46:18.409
understanding of people and
physics.

00:46:18.409 --> 00:46:22.067
And, in fact,
the most dominant proponent of

00:46:22.067 --> 00:46:25.300
the view is our very own Frank
Keil,

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:29.920
Master of Morse College at
Yale, who has strongly defended

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:33.730
the notion of an intuitive
biological module.

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:35.907
Final question,
just to raise:

00:46:35.907 --> 00:46:40.038
I've talked in terms of the
modular view but there might

00:46:40.038 --> 00:46:44.243
also be profound general
differences between children and

00:46:44.243 --> 00:46:46.369
adults,
not just specific to how you

00:46:46.369 --> 00:46:48.790
think about objects or how you
think about people or how you

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:50.760
think about this or how you
think about that,

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.211
but rather more general.
And one claim,

00:46:53.211 --> 00:46:57.094
which we're going to return to
briefly next class when we talk

00:46:57.094 --> 00:46:59.923
about language,
is that there's a very,

00:46:59.923 --> 00:47:03.950
very big difference between a
creature that doesn't have

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:06.659
language and a creature that
does.

00:47:06.659 --> 00:47:09.971
And part of the claim is that
learning a language,

00:47:09.971 --> 00:47:13.282
learning to speak,
reconfigures the human brain in

00:47:13.282 --> 00:47:16.119
such a way that is really
exceptional.

00:47:16.119 --> 00:47:19.369
And that has no parallel in any
other species.

00:47:19.369 --> 00:47:24.570
And this is an interesting
claim and one we'll talk about.

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:29.140
Finally, I want to end with an
example from Stephen Jay Gould.

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:33.485
Suppose you hate development;
you hate developmental

00:47:33.485 --> 00:47:35.030
psychology;
you hate babies;

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:37.280
you hate children;
they're not cute;

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.260
they're ugly;
you don't want to have them;

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:41.722
you don't want to study them;
you're annoyed that we have to

00:47:41.722 --> 00:47:43.739
discuss them.
Fine.

00:47:43.739 --> 00:47:49.294
But there are reasons to study
development even if you are not

00:47:49.294 --> 00:47:54.848
interested in children because
sometimes developmental studies

00:47:54.848 --> 00:48:00.129
and developmental data and
developmental science can inform

00:48:00.129 --> 00:48:03.885
questions about adults.
And Stephen Jay Gould has a

00:48:03.885 --> 00:48:07.302
very nice example of this.
He asked the question "Is a

00:48:07.302 --> 00:48:12.504
zebra a black animal with white
stripes or a white animal with

00:48:12.504 --> 00:48:15.843
black stripes?"
Now, you could look at adult

00:48:15.843 --> 00:48:19.900
zebras all day long and you're
never going to figure this out.

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.360
But if you want to know the
answer, and I knew it,

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.619
but I forget what it is--It
doesn't matter.

00:48:24.619 --> 00:48:26.820
But if you wanted to know it
you could.

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.003
You would look at development
and you'd watch the

00:48:29.003 --> 00:48:31.731
embryological development of a
zebra and that's how you would

00:48:31.731 --> 00:48:33.460
learn the answer to your
question.

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:36.280
In fact, I'll end with a nice
quote.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:40.447
This is by the famous
biologist, D'Arcy Thompson,

00:48:40.447 --> 00:48:44.179
who wrote the book On Growth
and Form,

00:48:44.179 --> 00:48:47.233
 and it's sort of the model
of many developmental

00:48:47.233 --> 00:48:50.229
psychologists and many
evolutionary psychologists so

00:48:50.229 --> 00:48:52.989
I'll end with this:
"Everything is the way it is

00:48:52.989 --> 00:48:55.680
because it got that way."
Okay.

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.280
I'll see you next week.

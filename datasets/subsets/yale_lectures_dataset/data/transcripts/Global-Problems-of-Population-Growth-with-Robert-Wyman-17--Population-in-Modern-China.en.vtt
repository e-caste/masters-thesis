00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.850
Prof: Now in the last
lecture we talked about how

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.144
China has had this very dense
population of very poor

00:00:13.144 --> 00:00:16.120
peasants,
for a very long time,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.404
and we started discussing some
of the possibilities for why

00:00:20.404 --> 00:00:21.660
that would be.
 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.836
We talked about the possibility
that China just had a higher

00:00:26.836 --> 00:00:30.960
fertility rate and roughly that
was not true.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.640
We found that that the
Europeans and the Chinese both

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.780
had methods of controlling their
population.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.115
It doesn't mean the methods
were exactly equal,

00:00:42.115 --> 00:00:43.740
but they were rather opposite.
 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.330
The European method,
as you know was late marriage,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.430
incomplete marriage that half
or so,

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.110
40% or 50% of people never got
married,

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.940
or were unmarried at any given
time,

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.394
a great deal of lack of
marriage and late marriage

00:00:58.394 --> 00:01:01.674
meaning--
but once they got married they

00:01:01.674 --> 00:01:06.100
did not seem to have any
limitation on their fertility

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.694
and so half the people going at
full tilt is sort of one

00:01:10.694 --> 00:01:11.780
aliquot.
 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.555
The Chinese situation,
10% to 25% of the girls were

00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:18.349
done away with basically at
birth,

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:23.122
the rest all got married,
but within marriage they had a

00:01:23.122 --> 00:01:25.900
very low rate of reproduction.
 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.459
At the end, I don't think we'll
have time,

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:35.575
but if we do I'll show you some
of the evidence that this low

00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:39.483
rate of reproduction was not a
conscious effort to control

00:01:39.483 --> 00:01:42.640
fertility but was a result of
the culture.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.453
I discussed--I gave you that
conclusion last time but I

00:01:46.453 --> 00:01:50.054
didn't give you any data,
there's plenty of data for

00:01:50.054 --> 00:01:50.690
that.
 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.221
We're back to what the
difference is between China and

00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:58.300
Europe, why are they so
different?

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.840
Student:  I just have a
question;

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.188
I'm wondering what extent do
you believe that cultural

00:02:03.188 --> 00:02:06.159
programming was designed at some
early stage?

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.557
Prof: When you say
designed do you mean designed

00:02:08.557 --> 00:02:09.180
consciously?
 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.810
No, that I think the people had
no idea.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.611
People obey various cultural
rules, cultural rules happen

00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:16.360
randomly.
 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.105
You can watch-- anthropologists
watch cultures and culture is a

00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:23.430
very flexible thing and it
changes fairly frequently.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.504
If that change works people
retain it and the whole culture

00:02:26.504 --> 00:02:26.930
works.
 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.236
If that doesn't work,
either people change it again

00:02:30.236 --> 00:02:32.090
or the culture disappears.
 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.508
Most cultures over time have
disappeared.

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:37.635
Cultural evolution seems to
follow pretty much the same

00:02:37.635 --> 00:02:39.490
rules as biological evolution.
 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.049
Almost random change--in
biology you have random changes

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.872
in the genome,
the cosmic ray hits you or you

00:02:45.872 --> 00:02:48.869
smoke a cigarette,
or something like that,

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:53.291
and base pair changes or a
piece of chromosome jumps out

00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:55.568
and goes back in,
inserts itself,

00:02:55.568 --> 00:02:56.628
a lot of different things.
 

00:02:56.628 --> 00:03:00.620
These are mostly bad changes
but very rarely there's a good

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.240
change.
 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.864
If it's a good change
presumably that individual will

00:03:03.864 --> 00:03:06.489
have more children and so
there's more copies of that

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.710
genome in the next generation
and so on.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.530
You know the basic story of
evolution.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.378
Culture evolution ca be the
same;

00:03:12.378 --> 00:03:15.733
people change culture on the
basis of fads and who knows

00:03:15.733 --> 00:03:16.158
what.
 

00:03:16.158 --> 00:03:19.397
We've had a lot of evidence
that even the great reduction in

00:03:19.397 --> 00:03:21.812
fertility that we've seen all
over the world,

00:03:21.812 --> 00:03:23.680
has a lot of aspects of a fad.
 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.669
That once a small group adopts
it everybody looks around and

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.120
likes the idea and fertility
drops like a stone,

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.217
way before and rather
independently of economic

00:03:34.217 --> 00:03:36.345
changes,
and educational changes,

00:03:36.345 --> 00:03:39.807
and urbanization changes and a
lot of the lectures have shown

00:03:39.807 --> 00:03:40.270
that.
 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.979
That something is adopted,
for maybe unclear reasons,

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:45.726
by a small group,
people like it,

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:49.000
it's like the kind of clothes
that you wear or something,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.840
there's no rationality to it,
but if it works it gets

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.258
embedded in the culture.
 

00:03:53.258 --> 00:03:57.016
No, I don't think there's any
evidence that any of these

00:03:57.016 --> 00:04:00.842
practices were put into place
for the purpose that we now

00:04:00.842 --> 00:04:03.715
impute to them,
but they're practices that

00:04:03.715 --> 00:04:07.304
worked for that culture within
the rest of their ecological and

00:04:07.304 --> 00:04:10.758
cultural context,
and so it persisted.

00:04:10.758 --> 00:04:13.241
That's a very important--it's a
good question,

00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:16.220
it's a very important way of
thinking about culture.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.415
That it evolves very much in
the same way that biological

00:04:20.415 --> 00:04:23.711
things evolve,
and it's a decent introduction

00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:26.110
to what I want to say today.
 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.028
One of the strong aspects of
culture is family.

00:04:31.028 --> 00:04:33.680
In Chinese cultures,
as in many others,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.100
it's really the very center of
Chinese culture;

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.980
the family and their
responsibilities to each other.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.483
We talked, and I'll go back
over it a little bit,

00:04:44.483 --> 00:04:47.300
about how loosely bound the
families in Europe were.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.480
I'll refer to this later.
 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.019
In China, families are much
more tightly bound.

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:54.410
It's a much more functional
unit.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.677
This binding was ordered by
Confucian doctrine for a long

00:05:00.677 --> 00:05:02.470
time in China.
 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.050
That is, women had to give
absolute deference to men;

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.086
children had to give absolute
deference to parents and elders,

00:05:10.086 --> 00:05:11.079
for instance.
 

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:14.798
The relationship between
parents and children are

00:05:14.798 --> 00:05:19.990
extremely important and in China
children did not leave the home.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.319
In Europe, remember I described
to you that at age seven,

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:26.468
Charles Dickens goes out and
works and people are sent out to

00:05:26.468 --> 00:05:29.459
do service in different places
or would be apprentices.

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:33.322
Of course everything happened
in China, but the most usual

00:05:33.322 --> 00:05:37.524
thing was that the children were
kept at home and worked on the

00:05:37.524 --> 00:05:38.610
family land.
 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.579
The parents chose a spouse for
the child,

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:42.509
again in Europe,
people went out and had what

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.089
they called morganatic
marriages,

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:48.642
marriages presumably for love,
but the parents were not

00:05:48.642 --> 00:05:50.920
involved in the marriage.
 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.136
In China, after marriage,
the son remained living in his

00:05:54.136 --> 00:05:57.293
parent's compound and the
daughter-in-law moved in with

00:05:57.293 --> 00:06:00.050
them;
very, very standard kind of

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.959
situation.
 

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:04.129
There was no separate economic
unit for the married children.

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:08.091
As long as the father lived he
controlled the assets of all the

00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:10.367
family,
the children did not have

00:06:10.367 --> 00:06:13.379
independent stuff and money that
they owned,

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:15.540
it was all under the control of
the father,

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.259
and in old age it was the
children and not the community

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.639
who were responsible for support
of the parents.

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:24.459
That was part of the
tit-for-tat;

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:26.750
again in the culture this is
very closely arranged.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.422
The parents have
responsibilities toward the

00:06:28.422 --> 00:06:29.762
children;
the children have

00:06:29.762 --> 00:06:31.750
responsibilities toward the
parents.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.370
The parents support the
children when they're young,

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.250
provide land for them,
when they inherit the land,

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.879
but in return the children must
support the parents in old age.

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:49.209
Living in the family of your
parents is a very conservative

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:54.173
effect because the older
generation gets to dictate the

00:06:54.173 --> 00:06:58.584
customs and mores and the
behavior of the younger

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:01.653
generation,
and older generations are by

00:07:01.653 --> 00:07:04.838
definition conservative because
they were brought up in an older

00:07:04.838 --> 00:07:08.038
version of things,
and there may be modern things

00:07:08.038 --> 00:07:11.310
going on but they don't
generally accept them.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.629
With respect to fertility,
with respect to son preference,

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:19.259
a boy who may be 17 marries a
girl who may be 13,

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:23.144
14,15--and the boy is under the
thumb of his mother and the girl

00:07:23.144 --> 00:07:26.660
moves into the house and she's
only 13 and she's under the

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.860
thumb of everybody,
and the mother insists that she

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.079
get pregnant right away and have
a boy.

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:35.389
She describes it as:
'for my son's benefit.'

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:38.213
The cultural thing is,
she's doing it so that my son

00:07:38.213 --> 00:07:39.930
will pass on the family name.
 

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:40.949
It's good for my son.
 

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:44.279
But, the son probably doesn't
want it as times modernize.

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:47.666
He wants to enjoy his life and
enjoy his wife and so forth,

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:51.055
but they have little power,
the son and the daughter-in-law

00:07:51.055 --> 00:07:52.339
have little power.
 

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:57.797
It's the grandparents that have
the cultural power in the family

00:07:57.797 --> 00:08:02.040
so it's a very conservative
factor in cultures and

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.680
especially in matters of
reproduction.

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:13.857
In return, as I mentioned,
for children giving up autonomy

00:08:13.857 --> 00:08:15.884
which they give up,
the children are very much

00:08:15.884 --> 00:08:18.281
under control of their parents,
and for living in this absolute

00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:18.778
deference.
 

00:08:18.778 --> 00:08:22.000
Fathers, in a lot of China,
at different times in history

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.509
had the right to kill a child if
the child was disobedient.

00:08:25.509 --> 00:08:27.370
That was not against the law.
 

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.433
In return for this,
they had to support the

00:08:33.433 --> 00:08:35.613
children of all ages,
find spouses,

00:08:35.613 --> 00:08:40.620
and ensure resources for the
next generation and the essence,

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.875
in a sense, is really the only
resource that peasants generally

00:08:43.875 --> 00:08:47.259
have is some land,
that meant giving the children

00:08:47.259 --> 00:08:49.538
land for the next generation.
 

00:08:49.538 --> 00:08:51.856
In England especially,
and in a lot of the rest of

00:08:51.856 --> 00:08:54.120
Europe,
they practiced primogeniture,

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.590
that only the oldest son got
the land,

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.975
and so the holdings,
whatever amount of land the

00:08:59.975 --> 00:09:02.278
parents had was kept together.
 

00:09:02.278 --> 00:09:05.460
The Chinese did not practice
primogeniture.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.535
We're talking about a lot of
places over a long time so I'm

00:09:07.535 --> 00:09:09.288
sure there were some places
where it happened,

00:09:09.288 --> 00:09:11.941
but in general,
they did not practice

00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:13.120
primogeniture.
 

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.248
On the death of the father,
the family land would be

00:09:16.248 --> 00:09:19.500
divided up among however many
sons that there were.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.629
This had the good benefit that
no one was forced,

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:25.788
and one of the cultural reasons
for it,

00:09:25.788 --> 00:09:28.330
that with land you could start
a family,

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.389
you could have children,
you could have sons,

00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:33.311
so no one would be forced into
the situation which was

00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:36.398
unbearable in traditional
Chinese culture of not having a

00:09:36.398 --> 00:09:36.840
son.
 

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.907
You had to have son,
in order to have a son you had

00:09:38.907 --> 00:09:39.610
to have a wife.
 

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.756
In order to have a wife you had
to have means of supporting her

00:09:43.756 --> 00:09:46.567
a little bit,
so the family had to give you

00:09:46.567 --> 00:09:47.168
land.
 

00:09:47.168 --> 00:09:50.534
This factor,
the lack of--the division of

00:09:50.534 --> 00:09:55.077
family land in China had
tremendous impact on the whole

00:09:55.077 --> 00:10:00.113
economic situation of China;
of course, as population grew,

00:10:00.113 --> 00:10:04.721
that guaranteed that the plots
of land would get smaller and

00:10:04.721 --> 00:10:09.408
smaller, and smaller right down
to the subsistence level.

00:10:09.408 --> 00:10:13.009
And the Chinese were very well
aware of this.

00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:16.764
A common Chinese saying,
which summarized this

00:10:16.764 --> 00:10:20.251
phenomenon says,
"fortunes seldom continue

00:10:20.251 --> 00:10:23.230
considerable in the same family
beyond the third

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.500
generation."
 

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.298
If you're Chinese and say that,
we have similar sayings in the

00:10:28.298 --> 00:10:30.789
western world,
but they're very different

00:10:30.789 --> 00:10:31.600
meanings.
 

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.211
In China what it means,
if you have a fortune,

00:10:34.211 --> 00:10:36.823
if you're rich,
you'll be able to keep more of

00:10:36.823 --> 00:10:39.320
your children alive including
the sons.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.965
If you have more sons you have
to divide your land into more

00:10:42.965 --> 00:10:46.548
small pieces and you go right
back to the poverty level.

00:10:46.548 --> 00:10:50.341
When we say things like that in
the West, it means the first

00:10:50.341 --> 00:10:53.620
generation works very hard,
is honorable in a sense,

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.649
makes money.
 

00:10:54.649 --> 00:10:57.509
The second generation have seen
their parents work,

00:10:57.509 --> 00:11:02.418
retains some of that work
ethic, but the children,

00:11:02.418 --> 00:11:06.679
the grandchildren grow up rich
and they're rotters and they

00:11:06.679 --> 00:11:08.370
don't work very hard.
 

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:13.407
The same cultural impression
works in both cultures that

00:11:13.407 --> 00:11:17.620
riches don't last very long in
generations,

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:23.474
but one is due to the scarcity
of the division of land and one

00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:27.889
is due to the personality of the
individual.

00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:31.248
Malthus knew about this saying,
the saying is so popular in

00:11:31.248 --> 00:11:34.269
China,
Malthus knew about this saying

00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:39.019
and wrote about it 200 years ago
and it's still common--

00:11:39.019 --> 00:11:42.398
that I read it as a Chinese
saying in The New York Times

00:11:42.398 --> 00:11:43.679
a few years ago.
 

00:11:47.668 --> 00:11:51.749
Again, this is in contrast to
the European situation where

00:11:51.749 --> 00:11:55.755
children left home early to work
in a succession of other

00:11:55.755 --> 00:11:56.830
households.
 

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:00.139
They chose their own spouses,
very interestingly,

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:03.157
as evidence of this kind of
dissolution that in most of the

00:12:03.157 --> 00:12:05.809
world we have these tight
families when someone gets

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:07.840
married there's some record of
it,

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.698
there's some registry,
a personal family record kept

00:12:10.698 --> 00:12:13.840
as a family treasure or some
governmental or village,

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.190
or religious record,
and in all these countries with

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.933
tight marriages there's a long
list of relatives that have

00:12:20.933 --> 00:12:24.350
witnessed the weddings and say
yes this is true.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:27.061
Not in England,
the list--it's--the two people

00:12:27.061 --> 00:12:28.567
go to church,
or a priest,

00:12:28.567 --> 00:12:31.278
or a minister marries them and
that's it.

00:12:31.278 --> 00:12:35.368
The family can be involved but
need to have nothing to do with

00:12:35.368 --> 00:12:38.918
it and legally doesn't have
anything to do with it.

00:12:38.918 --> 00:12:40.921
After marriage,
unless they are the

00:12:40.921 --> 00:12:43.746
primogeniture son that is
inheriting the father's

00:12:43.746 --> 00:12:46.456
household,
they go and set up their own

00:12:46.456 --> 00:12:49.460
household somewhere else and
live separately.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:53.861
As soon as they get married
they're economically independent

00:12:53.861 --> 00:12:55.279
of their parents.
 

00:12:55.279 --> 00:13:00.477
In one data set,
in 75% of cases in northwest

00:13:00.477 --> 00:13:02.937
Europe,
children didn't even live in

00:13:02.937 --> 00:13:04.990
the same village where their
parents lived,

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:10.903
so it wasn't like they were
really close but they moved

00:13:10.903 --> 00:13:11.668
away.
 

00:13:11.668 --> 00:13:14.452
Now again, in cultures all
these--a lot of things have to

00:13:14.452 --> 00:13:16.740
fit together so the system of
independence,

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.721
the European system,
could only occur if some

00:13:18.721 --> 00:13:20.840
provision is made for support of
the elderly.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:25.134
In China the young--the
children have the responsibility

00:13:25.134 --> 00:13:29.350
to take care of the elderly and
this has to happen,

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.580
all elderly need to be taken
care of,

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:35.152
and the culture would never
evolve successfully if there

00:13:35.152 --> 00:13:38.789
wasn't some way of European
oldsters getting some sort of

00:13:38.789 --> 00:13:39.570
support.
 

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.155
Interestingly,
in Europe it was not the

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:45.967
children who were responsible
for support of the elderly,

00:13:45.967 --> 00:13:49.100
but the community had that
responsibility.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:54.928
From 1598, Parliament--and
that's a long time ago 1598,

00:13:54.928 --> 00:13:58.630
Parliament required overseers
of the poor to be appointed

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.538
every year in every parish in
the country;

00:14:01.538 --> 00:14:05.721
every parish was responsible
for its own poor,

00:14:05.721 --> 00:14:08.230
which was mostly elderly.
 

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:12.796
They not only had the duty to
support anybody that came and

00:14:12.796 --> 00:14:17.126
asked for it who was indeed
poor, they had to go out and

00:14:17.126 --> 00:14:18.860
identify the poor.
 

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.322
They had to--the poor that were
too helpless,

00:14:21.322 --> 00:14:23.057
or too ignorant,
or didn't know,

00:14:23.057 --> 00:14:26.639
they had the responsibility to
go out and identify the poor.

00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:29.740
We have a lot of argumentation
in America,

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.528
especially about our current
welfare state,

00:14:31.528 --> 00:14:36.062
how much effort should the
welfare agencies do to pull in

00:14:36.062 --> 00:14:39.759
clients for their services,
to advertise their services.

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:43.772
Well, 1598 England faced of
course the same issue and the

00:14:43.772 --> 00:14:48.294
Parliament then decided that no,
the responsibility of the

00:14:48.294 --> 00:14:52.730
community was to go out and
identify and find people who

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:53.940
needed help.
 

00:14:53.940 --> 00:15:00.099
These overseers were empowered
to levy taxes sufficient to pay

00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:01.210
for this.
 

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.326
The law was very clear that the
primary responsibility for

00:15:04.326 --> 00:15:06.460
providing relief lay with the
parish;

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.440
that was what happened.
 

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.143
There was no direct obligation
recognized between the child and

00:15:13.143 --> 00:15:13.918
the parent.
 

00:15:13.918 --> 00:15:18.870
A parent could not go and sue
his children for support.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.123
There was a back door,
a little loophole that once the

00:15:22.123 --> 00:15:25.375
parish discharged its
responsibility in supporting the

00:15:25.375 --> 00:15:28.552
poor,
than the parish could go and

00:15:28.552 --> 00:15:33.769
sue the child to reimburse the
parish for its expenses,

00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:37.048
so it wasn't totally that the
children got off the hook.

00:15:37.048 --> 00:15:39.395
That was when the children
lived in a different village and

00:15:39.395 --> 00:15:42.503
this was all very localized,
it was a very hard thing to

00:15:42.503 --> 00:15:44.572
enforce,
and basically it was the

00:15:44.572 --> 00:15:46.879
community that had this
responsibility.

00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:49.639
Colonial America picked up that
same pattern,

00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:53.085
and there are really quite
horrible stories of pregnant

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:55.049
women,
who either got pregnant out of

00:15:55.049 --> 00:15:56.720
wedlock or whose husband had
died,

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.538
or had gone off to a war or
something,

00:15:58.538 --> 00:16:01.816
sort of being chased from
village to village while they

00:16:01.816 --> 00:16:05.517
were pregnant and ready to give
birth because the village knew

00:16:05.517 --> 00:16:09.035
that if that child was born in
that village they would ever

00:16:09.035 --> 00:16:12.918
after have to do poor relief for
the mother and the child.

00:16:12.918 --> 00:16:19.178
There's some really unpleasant
stories from Colonial America.

00:16:19.178 --> 00:16:20.798
Well so you have two different
patterns,

00:16:20.798 --> 00:16:24.990
a Chinese, and of course it's
not limited to China,

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:27.860
where the children are under
the thumb of the grandparents,

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.700
especially the grandmother in
reproductive matters and so

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.168
behavior is not terribly
flexible.

00:16:34.168 --> 00:16:36.610
It's whatever the older
generation believed.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.567
Whereas in Europe,
children go out and form their

00:16:40.567 --> 00:16:45.265
own households and they can
respond more easily to changes

00:16:45.265 --> 00:16:47.080
in cultural norms.
 

00:16:51.048 --> 00:16:52.970
The younger boys,
it's quite interesting,

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:57.496
while one of the results of
primogeniture is that you keep

00:16:57.496 --> 00:17:00.878
the plots together so that,
in the peasantry,

00:17:00.878 --> 00:17:04.578
you don't have this enormous
class of terribly poor peasants,

00:17:04.578 --> 00:17:09.298
the peasants retain a
reasonable amount of land.

00:17:09.298 --> 00:17:14.223
But all the rest of the sons go
off to the cities and they get

00:17:14.223 --> 00:17:16.000
forced off the land.
 

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.321
Demographically they usually
don't require the resources to

00:17:20.321 --> 00:17:24.048
get married because in the
cities it's very hard to

00:17:24.048 --> 00:17:26.210
accumulate the resources.
 

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:29.259
They never get married,
they never have children,

00:17:29.259 --> 00:17:33.229
as I mentioned before the death
rates in the cities were so

00:17:33.229 --> 00:17:37.539
incredibly high that about every
generation about a third of the

00:17:37.539 --> 00:17:41.713
city people died and had to be
replaced by new immigrants from

00:17:41.713 --> 00:17:43.220
the countryside.
 

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:47.180
Still, there was quite a large
population of unemployed or

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.890
barely employed people in the
cities.

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:51.618
What did they do?
 

00:17:51.618 --> 00:17:53.798
They joined armies,
that's one of the big

00:17:53.798 --> 00:17:57.118
employers--especially of men,
big armies--require manpower.

00:17:57.118 --> 00:18:01.670
Some historians believe that
the aggressiveness of Europe,

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.247
all the constant wars that
Europe was in during this period

00:18:04.247 --> 00:18:07.163
and the colonial expansion,
were due to all these young men

00:18:07.163 --> 00:18:09.819
in the army and they had to do
something with them.

00:18:09.819 --> 00:18:13.536
Or reverse, they were available;
all these young men were

00:18:13.536 --> 00:18:17.215
available for the army and so
they were employed to do

00:18:17.215 --> 00:18:20.480
whatever the rulers believed
they should do.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:25.185
They also tried to make a
living in the city and did a lot

00:18:25.185 --> 00:18:29.174
of apprenticeship,
and they would start a small

00:18:29.174 --> 00:18:31.194
trade,
or some hand manufacturing

00:18:31.194 --> 00:18:33.476
operation,
and again some historians

00:18:33.476 --> 00:18:37.359
believe that this excess of
males in the city trying to cope

00:18:37.359 --> 00:18:42.211
on their own--
formed one of the basis for the

00:18:42.211 --> 00:18:44.980
industrial revolution.
 

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.785
The two systems were
really--the European and Chinese

00:18:47.785 --> 00:18:50.859
were sort of diametrically
opposite and the Chinese system

00:18:50.859 --> 00:18:53.720
was in a sense much kinder
because no one would--

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.180
in Europe children were sort of
basically sacrificed,

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.500
goodbye, have a good time in
life, we'll see you.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.871
Whereas, in China,
they were kept at home in the

00:19:01.871 --> 00:19:03.838
security of the family and its
land,

00:19:03.838 --> 00:19:07.277
which is both emotionally more
secure and economically more

00:19:07.277 --> 00:19:09.230
secure,
but very poor.

00:19:16.368 --> 00:19:20.220
It looks like this very
practice, which is the center of

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.031
Chinese culture,
the tightness of the family,

00:19:23.031 --> 00:19:27.115
with respect for elders,
lack of adolescent rebellion,

00:19:27.115 --> 00:19:29.124
etc.,
all the good characteristic

00:19:29.124 --> 00:19:33.390
things that go along with that,
may also be one of the reasons

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:38.001
why China suffered the
Malthusian misery situation for

00:19:38.001 --> 00:19:38.960
so long.
 

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.474
The land parcels on which
people tried to survive were

00:19:42.474 --> 00:19:46.390
just so tiny that they were up
against an absolute limit.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:56.266
All right, we can see in the
statistics, the result of this

00:19:56.266 --> 00:19:59.150
keeping people on the land.
 

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:04.241
China, basically as observed by
Chinese and by everyone else,

00:20:04.241 --> 00:20:08.826
became what was called a vast
sea of impoverished rural

00:20:08.826 --> 00:20:09.930
peasants.
 

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:14.088
As late as 1900,94% of Chinese
lived in villages,

00:20:14.088 --> 00:20:16.950
meaning they were agricultural.
 

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:20.723
In contrast,
in England 100 years earlier in

00:20:20.723 --> 00:20:25.288
1800, the agricultural
population was down to 37%.

00:20:25.288 --> 00:20:30.540
So, China was way more than 100
years behind England,

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:36.400
at least in urbanizing and
industrializing and so forth.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.642
Without enough land,
nonetheless,

00:20:38.642 --> 00:20:42.498
when the plots got so small
that people really could not

00:20:42.498 --> 00:20:45.343
survive on them,
of course even in China they

00:20:45.343 --> 00:20:48.327
had to leave the land,
and you got a class of landless

00:20:48.327 --> 00:20:50.960
laborers,
as there really was everywhere.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:55.519
But the conditions which they
left in Europe--

00:20:55.519 --> 00:20:58.880
The poverty on the farms was so
much worse than,

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.095
say in Europe,
that when they moved to the

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:07.309
cities it was even a step
further down.

00:21:07.309 --> 00:21:10.078
This is really disastrous.
 

00:21:10.078 --> 00:21:14.818
In the 1930s both Americans and
Mao,

00:21:14.818 --> 00:21:18.249
Mao did some of his earliest
scholarly work investigating

00:21:18.249 --> 00:21:20.759
conditions of the rural poor in
China,

00:21:20.759 --> 00:21:27.242
and so there's a fair amount of
data that in the 1930s wages

00:21:27.242 --> 00:21:33.126
that to be paid for a laborer,
what you paid a man to work for

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:35.686
a day,
was the same as it cost you to

00:21:35.686 --> 00:21:37.598
provide fodder for a donkey.
 

00:21:37.598 --> 00:21:41.154
The cost per day of a donkey
and a human were the same,

00:21:41.154 --> 00:21:43.130
it was such absolute misery.
 

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:46.759
Which did people prefer to hire?
 

00:21:46.759 --> 00:21:49.079
Buy a donkey or hire a human?
 

00:21:49.079 --> 00:21:51.990
Same cost per day--what?
 

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:54.568
Student:  Depends on
what you have to do.

00:21:54.568 --> 00:21:56.756
Prof: Okay,
all the things that donkeys or

00:21:56.756 --> 00:21:58.441
humans can do,
but donkeys especially,

00:21:58.441 --> 00:21:59.579
what can a donkey do?
 

00:21:59.579 --> 00:22:00.509
It carries things.
 

00:22:00.509 --> 00:22:03.119
It turns out that they
preferred to hire the human.

00:22:03.119 --> 00:22:04.240
Why?
 

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.288
Because if you have a donkey,
you have to feed him every day,

00:22:07.288 --> 00:22:09.220
even when the donkey is not
working.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.519
If you have a human,
you pay him for that day,

00:22:11.519 --> 00:22:14.799
essentially subsistence wages,
just enough food to keep going

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:17.368
which is more or less the same
as the donkey.

00:22:17.368 --> 00:22:21.711
And when you don't need them,
when the harvest is gone,

00:22:21.711 --> 00:22:25.170
or you don't have anything to
carry, bye.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.346
That's what you see in the
Chinese cities of all this time

00:22:28.346 --> 00:22:30.965
that there was very little
mechanized transport,

00:22:30.965 --> 00:22:33.140
everything was carried by
rickshaw;

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.568
rickshaw is a seat but human
laborers were carrying all the

00:22:36.568 --> 00:22:39.230
goods around the cities and
between cities.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:43.663
On the farms also,
labor was so cheap and there

00:22:43.663 --> 00:22:50.097
were so many humans per land,
that there was no economic

00:22:50.097 --> 00:22:56.410
incentive to get animals to do
your heavy labor.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:59.257
So, there was an absence of
draft animals in China,

00:22:59.257 --> 00:23:02.673
an amazing difference between
Europe and China is the absence

00:23:02.673 --> 00:23:03.868
of draft animals.
 

00:23:03.868 --> 00:23:06.961
It's very interesting,
draft animals not only provide

00:23:06.961 --> 00:23:09.815
you pulling labor,
but they provide manure,

00:23:09.815 --> 00:23:12.960
and Europe had plenty of manure
from all the--

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.940
they had a lot of animals.
 

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.430
The Chinese then had to go to
human manure.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:21.278
The whole industry of spreading
the human manure,

00:23:21.278 --> 00:23:27.038
night soil as they call it,
on the fields is due to a lack

00:23:27.038 --> 00:23:29.160
of draft animals.
 

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:36.763
This continued as late as the
1970s, some parts of China were

00:23:36.763 --> 00:23:41.578
still too poor to have farm
animals.

00:23:41.578 --> 00:23:44.426
You didn't get mechanized
farming, you didn't get any of

00:23:44.426 --> 00:23:47.218
the--
labor was so cheap they didn't

00:23:47.218 --> 00:23:52.076
get any of the mechanization of
either motorized transport in

00:23:52.076 --> 00:23:56.529
cities or agricultural machinery
in the countryside.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:06.578
This kind of--people coming
down to a very,

00:24:06.578 --> 00:24:09.130
very--because the land got so
crowded,

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:13.701
people coming down to a very,
very poor state of existence

00:24:13.701 --> 00:24:16.828
was really a great weakness of
China.

00:24:16.828 --> 00:24:20.048
While, at the top,
the Emperor and the court were

00:24:20.048 --> 00:24:23.335
fabulously wealthy,
that was based on the backs of

00:24:23.335 --> 00:24:26.220
a mass of really,
really poor peasants.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:32.568
When Europe developed good
shipping and modern arms--

00:24:32.568 --> 00:24:36.357
was starting to develop modern
armaments they were able to

00:24:36.357 --> 00:24:40.345
thrust their power all the way
from Europe around most of the

00:24:40.345 --> 00:24:41.009
world.
 

00:24:41.009 --> 00:24:44.223
It's not very easy to get by
sailing ship from Europe to

00:24:44.223 --> 00:24:47.599
China,
but by the early 1800s Europe

00:24:47.599 --> 00:24:53.400
could project enough military
power into China to defeat the

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.170
Chinese armies.
 

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:57.652
As I mentioned last time,
the British were,

00:24:57.652 --> 00:25:00.252
by that time,
having a terrible trade deficit

00:25:00.252 --> 00:25:01.140
with China.
 

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.086
The British were addicted to
tea, and they were losing all

00:25:04.086 --> 00:25:06.930
their money and the tea
addiction would have choked--

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:10.853
the ledgers are very clear
how--England was just basically

00:25:10.853 --> 00:25:15.051
losing all its money and if they
didn't restore the balance of

00:25:15.051 --> 00:25:17.386
trade,
Europe would be bankrupt and

00:25:17.386 --> 00:25:20.259
that would have cut off the
industrial revolution.

00:25:20.259 --> 00:25:23.546
The money that could have
fueled the industrial revolution

00:25:23.546 --> 00:25:26.890
was in fact going to China to
feed a caffeine addiction.

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:29.577
It was really a massive,
massive effect and so the

00:25:29.577 --> 00:25:32.098
British started importing opium
into China,

00:25:32.098 --> 00:25:35.345
from India, in an attempt to
reverse the balance of trade,

00:25:35.345 --> 00:25:36.200
which it did.
 

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.824
I mentioned this,
the Chinese put down their foot

00:25:38.824 --> 00:25:42.268
and said 'no you can't addict my
people,' the British cried free

00:25:42.268 --> 00:25:44.970
trade,
invaded China in the first and

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:46.509
the second opium war.
 

00:25:46.509 --> 00:25:51.361
By about 1840 it was clear that
China was a paper tiger

00:25:51.361 --> 00:25:52.529
militarily.
 

00:25:52.529 --> 00:25:56.518
Though they really had a vast
number of people in a very

00:25:56.518 --> 00:26:00.070
strong autocratic state,
they could not respond to

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:02.028
Western military power.
 

00:26:02.028 --> 00:26:04.548
Once kicked out--for a short
interim there,

00:26:04.548 --> 00:26:07.548
before the opium war,
the Chinese were able to kick

00:26:07.548 --> 00:26:09.230
the opium smugglers out.
 

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:10.009
Where did they go?
 

00:26:10.009 --> 00:26:12.762
To a little rocky island off
the coast of South China,

00:26:12.762 --> 00:26:14.528
and now that's called Hong
Kong.

00:26:14.528 --> 00:26:19.695
It started as a smuggler's den,
and basically the big Jardine

00:26:19.695 --> 00:26:23.480
Matheson,
all the big British fortunes

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:29.084
that stemmed from the China
trade were really opium trade,

00:26:29.084 --> 00:26:30.460
drug trade.
 

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:33.230
The British started controlling
parts of China,

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.670
then the Germans moved in,
the French moved in,

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.884
and the Americans when--in the
periods when China's government

00:26:38.884 --> 00:26:41.890
had some power were very happy
to intermediate in the drug

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:44.580
trade,
and help avoid certain

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.420
restrictions on the Brits and so
forth.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.945
Then the Japanese got
modernized in the early 1900s

00:26:51.945 --> 00:26:56.529
and they invaded China,
and the end result of this,

00:26:56.529 --> 00:27:02.132
is that from the first opium
war for 115 years China was

00:27:02.132 --> 00:27:08.345
basically at the mercy of the
European imperial powers and the

00:27:08.345 --> 00:27:11.910
Japanese newly imperial state.
 

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:14.660
The final chapter on that,
of course,

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.479
is World War II where the
Japanese invaded and were

00:27:17.479 --> 00:27:19.509
incredibly brutal to the
Chinese,

00:27:19.509 --> 00:27:23.347
and I read you sometime back,
a story about the Rape of

00:27:23.347 --> 00:27:25.798
Nanking,
and then after that there was

00:27:25.798 --> 00:27:29.079
the battle between the
communists and the nationalists,

00:27:29.079 --> 00:27:32.950
won by the communists;
a very, very vicious civil war.

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:40.192
Basically China was devastated
by this 115 years of dissolution

00:27:40.192 --> 00:27:46.733
of the government and being
taken advantage of by foreign

00:27:46.733 --> 00:27:48.019
powers.
 

00:27:48.019 --> 00:27:51.548
The scarcity of land,
just as a sort of footnote to

00:27:51.548 --> 00:27:54.583
that history,
the scarcity of land remains a

00:27:54.583 --> 00:27:56.558
major problem for China.
 

00:27:56.558 --> 00:27:59.545
Especially the dry and hilly
land, you may remember last time

00:27:59.545 --> 00:28:02.133
I told you that as American
foods came in and farming

00:28:02.133 --> 00:28:05.094
increased,
that people learned that they

00:28:05.094 --> 00:28:08.528
could grow food on hilly land
and dry land,

00:28:08.528 --> 00:28:12.500
and so the population expanded
into this marginal land.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:16.240
February, the end of February
this year,

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.436
just a month ago,
there was a story in The

00:28:19.436 --> 00:28:23.506
Times. China's now going
through the worst drought in

00:28:23.506 --> 00:28:26.321
half a century,
which also means that they go

00:28:26.321 --> 00:28:29.299
through this every half century,
so it's not really an

00:28:29.299 --> 00:28:31.009
incredibly unusual thing.
 

00:28:31.009 --> 00:28:34.672
In the wheat band,
a farmer's land is 1/3 of an

00:28:34.672 --> 00:28:36.854
acre,
and remember I told you the

00:28:36.854 --> 00:28:39.829
average plot farm size was only
1/10th of an acre,

00:28:39.829 --> 00:28:40.848
so this guy is rich.
 

00:28:40.848 --> 00:28:43.130
He's got 1/3 of an acre,
three times as much.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:44.920
Why does he have so much?
 

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.990
Because it's carved out of a
rocky hillside in a dry region.

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:52.113
You can't survive on a 1/10th
of an acre there,

00:28:52.113 --> 00:28:54.150
you need 3/10ths of an acre.
 

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:56.199
The aquifers have been so
depleted that,

00:28:56.199 --> 00:28:58.931
in some farming regions,
wells have to go down a half

00:28:58.931 --> 00:29:01.872
mile before striking water;
all the water that's less

00:29:01.872 --> 00:29:03.920
further down has already been
used up.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.950
They're going through this
drought.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:07.355
These people,
in good times,

00:29:07.355 --> 00:29:08.759
live on a 1/3 of an acre.
 

00:29:08.759 --> 00:29:10.334
On a hilly, rocky,
dry hillside,

00:29:10.334 --> 00:29:12.009
you're not going to make a lot.
 

00:29:12.009 --> 00:29:15.190
And now, with the economic
collapse in the world,

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:19.906
there's millions of migrant
workers coming back onto the

00:29:19.906 --> 00:29:21.991
farms--
the countryside and they're

00:29:21.991 --> 00:29:25.106
going to have to now,
somehow, be supported on this

00:29:25.106 --> 00:29:27.150
very,
very poor agriculture.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:34.337
Finally, after the Korean War,
I may have forgotten to mention

00:29:34.337 --> 00:29:36.711
the Korean War,
where the--some elements of the

00:29:36.711 --> 00:29:39.130
United States said they were
going to invade China.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.585
This was the time when they
were threatening to bomb China

00:29:42.585 --> 00:29:44.039
back to the Stone Age.
 

00:29:44.039 --> 00:29:46.338
Do you know that expression?
 

00:29:46.338 --> 00:29:49.323
It was Senator William Knoland
from California who was the main

00:29:49.323 --> 00:29:51.730
advocate of bombing China back
to the Stone Age.

00:29:55.858 --> 00:29:56.505
The U.S.
 

00:29:56.505 --> 00:30:01.269
did not invade China and China
fought them in North Korea;

00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:03.450
very, very nasty,
bloody situation.

00:30:06.809 --> 00:30:09.190
They finally got this peace.
 

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:12.578
The data seems to show that in
1952,

00:30:12.578 --> 00:30:16.098
which is at the end of the
Korean War,

00:30:16.098 --> 00:30:19.592
Chinese had a significantly
lower per capita income than

00:30:19.592 --> 00:30:23.147
they had at the end of the Sung
Dynasty in the thirteenth

00:30:23.147 --> 00:30:23.910
century.
 

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:28.883
That there had been 700 years
with--600 or 700 years with no

00:30:28.883 --> 00:30:32.338
progress--real progress for the
people.

00:30:32.338 --> 00:30:34.407
It was a real Malthusian
situation where the population

00:30:34.407 --> 00:30:36.720
had grown up tremendously,
production had increased

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.333
tremendously,
but the two equaled out and no

00:30:40.333 --> 00:30:41.670
net progress.
 

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:44.609
There's the new communist
government which was very

00:30:44.609 --> 00:30:48.196
powerful and not hesitant about
using its power and being very

00:30:48.196 --> 00:30:49.078
autocratic.
 

00:30:49.078 --> 00:30:52.348
Right away they did a number of
very good things,

00:30:52.348 --> 00:30:54.818
they invested very heavily in
public health,

00:30:54.818 --> 00:30:58.720
and introduced the very basic
measures of hygiene,

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.240
disease control and pest
control.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.318
It's a big thing.
 

00:31:02.318 --> 00:31:05.791
Loudspeakers--this period
loudspeakers everywhere in China

00:31:05.791 --> 00:31:08.663
were blaring to the people,
you didn't have any time to

00:31:08.663 --> 00:31:10.868
think because there were
loudspeakers everywhere at you.

00:31:10.868 --> 00:31:15.430
"Honorable elders please
do not spit on the ground."

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:18.089
Any of--you Chinese have heard
this or stories of this?

00:31:18.089 --> 00:31:19.348
You have.
 

00:31:19.348 --> 00:31:22.400
There was a big campaign to
swat flies;

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.380
the flies were spreading
disease from the feces which was

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.019
not in--not flushed away in
toilets.

00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:30.769
So flies would step into the
feces and then step onto you.

00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:34.365
So the same thing,
swat a fly and they killed

00:31:34.365 --> 00:31:36.000
zillions of flies.
 

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.832
The flies eventually did get
controlled in China and whether

00:31:39.832 --> 00:31:42.755
it was due to the swat--a-fly
campaign or not,

00:31:42.755 --> 00:31:43.858
I don't know.
 

00:31:43.858 --> 00:31:47.608
Due to these things,
by 1957, which,

00:31:47.608 --> 00:31:50.173
remember, we have a devastated
country where the government

00:31:50.173 --> 00:31:53.198
takes control in 1949,
in eight years the death rate

00:31:53.198 --> 00:31:55.250
went to half what it had been.
 

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:58.818
That's an amazing,
amazing achievement.

00:31:58.818 --> 00:32:02.779
When you cut the death rate in
half, what happens?

00:32:02.779 --> 00:32:06.621
Population explosion;
so China had its most extreme

00:32:06.621 --> 00:32:10.318
population explosion after the
communists came to power.

00:32:10.318 --> 00:32:16.960
Now these are not ignorant
people.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.089
Were they worried about the
population explosion?

00:32:19.089 --> 00:32:21.519
The answer is: absolutely not.
 

00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:24.420
Marxist theory is very
pronatalist.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.544
Marx hated Malthus,
there's a long literature of

00:32:27.544 --> 00:32:30.603
communist, socialist invective
against Malthus,

00:32:30.603 --> 00:32:33.130
and they're really opposite
poles.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:37.535
Now it's sort of the right wing
and the extreme left thing that

00:32:37.535 --> 00:32:41.016
it opposes Malthus,
and liberals and moderates are

00:32:41.016 --> 00:32:43.288
more predisposed toward him.
 

00:32:43.288 --> 00:32:44.965
At any rate,
the Marxist theory

00:32:44.965 --> 00:32:46.420
is--basically says this.
 

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:50.450
Look, in the capitalist
economy, the capitalist take

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:52.540
workers,
they employ them in factories,

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:56.010
and they make a surplus,
so the capitalist lives very

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:57.818
well on the surplus.
 

00:32:57.818 --> 00:32:59.960
The socialist economy can do
just as well.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:03.644
It can employ the workers,
and they can make a surplus

00:33:03.644 --> 00:33:06.517
over them,
but instead of having big fat

00:33:06.517 --> 00:33:10.087
mansions and cigars,
the socialist government will

00:33:10.087 --> 00:33:13.529
reinvest the money for the good
of the people,

00:33:13.529 --> 00:33:16.308
so the more people the merrier.
 

00:33:16.308 --> 00:33:19.160
Marx--original Marxist doctrine
was very,

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.690
very clear that since the
capitalist can exploit labor,

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:28.205
so can the state and that will
move down to the benefit of the

00:33:28.205 --> 00:33:29.019
people.
 

00:33:29.019 --> 00:33:33.710
The way this was translated
from Marx into China,

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:39.720
they call Malthusian's theory
something like 'ren kou lun,

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:43.297
which means 'man mouth theory,'
which means that every man is

00:33:43.297 --> 00:33:47.298
born with a mouth,
i.e., he's a consumer and that

00:33:47.298 --> 00:33:49.038
splits up the pie.
 

00:33:49.038 --> 00:33:55.681
The Marxist translate their
theory as 'man hand theory,'

00:33:55.681 --> 00:34:03.410
that a man is born not only with
a mouth to consume but a hand to

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:06.286
do work,
and the question is if

00:34:06.286 --> 00:34:09.849
the--that the socialist state
can employ the hands to produce

00:34:09.849 --> 00:34:13.650
more than the mouth require,
so they didn't buy,

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:18.050
they were very in favor of high
population.

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:20.786
In 1949, Mao,
becoming in charge of a very

00:34:20.786 --> 00:34:24.030
devastated country says,
"Revolution plus

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:28.148
production will enable China to
feed and employ the large and

00:34:28.148 --> 00:34:30.070
growing population."
 

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:34.980
No worry; until they got some
facts.

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:38.371
In 1953 the country was stable
enough that they took their

00:34:38.371 --> 00:34:39.800
first national census.
 

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.202
At that time,
they thought they had something

00:34:42.202 --> 00:34:45.643
like 426 million people and that
the number had not been growing

00:34:45.643 --> 00:34:49.030
in the century because of all
the civil and foreign wars,

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:51.070
and natural calamities in China.
 

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:52.706
It was a disaster,
so they thought,

00:34:52.706 --> 00:34:55.260
well, population can't grow
under those situations.

00:34:55.260 --> 00:35:00.001
Then they took a census and
they counted 600 million people,

00:35:00.001 --> 00:35:03.778
which was 50% more,
a third larger than they had

00:35:03.778 --> 00:35:06.110
expected that were there.
 

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:10.615
The error, what they expected
to find and what they did find,

00:35:10.615 --> 00:35:12.643
was equal to the whole U.S.
 

00:35:12.643 --> 00:35:16.400
population at that time,
so it was a big shock.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.990
They finally responded
rationally, and immediately

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:24.389
China passed the contraceptives
and induced abortion act,

00:35:24.389 --> 00:35:28.034
legalizing the importation and
sale of contraceptives and

00:35:28.034 --> 00:35:30.639
legalizing sterilization and
abortion.

00:35:30.639 --> 00:35:32.784
There was one small problem,
they didn't have any

00:35:32.784 --> 00:35:34.509
contraceptives,
they didn't have the

00:35:34.509 --> 00:35:37.208
manufacturing facilities,
so they legalized the

00:35:37.208 --> 00:35:39.639
importation of them and
imported--

00:35:39.639 --> 00:35:42.050
But, the Chinese had no foreign
currency at that time,

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:44.820
it was way, way before any kind
of economic progress,

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:50.050
and so they just didn't have it.
 

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:53.199
The cities got--there was
always some money in the cities,

00:35:53.199 --> 00:35:57.750
so the cities got some of the
foreign contraceptives and--

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.199
but in the countryside where
the vast,

00:36:00.199 --> 00:36:02.612
vast majority of the people
lived at the time and basically

00:36:02.612 --> 00:36:04.581
had no access,
and if they did have access

00:36:04.581 --> 00:36:06.730
they wouldn't have been able to
afford them,

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:10.300
so the government policy was
basically meaningless.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.570
What was the government to do?
 

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:16.322
In 1956 they realized that just
proclaiming something doesn't

00:36:16.322 --> 00:36:19.135
help, so they said,
well let's use traditional

00:36:19.135 --> 00:36:19.949
medicine.
 

00:36:23.949 --> 00:36:29.389
They asked all the traditional
Chinese doctors what to do.

00:36:29.389 --> 00:36:32.480
You must have traditional ways
of contraception,

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:35.110
of keeping women from having
children.

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:41.461
One of these became very well
popularized--popularized in the

00:36:41.461 --> 00:36:42.309
press.
 

00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:45.699
On the third day following her
period,

00:36:45.699 --> 00:36:49.110
a woman should ingest 14 live
tadpoles,

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:54.045
than ten the next day,
and then the woman would be

00:36:54.045 --> 00:36:57.570
assured sterility for five
years.

00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:01.612
If the woman did this twice,
then traditional medicine said

00:37:01.612 --> 00:37:04.820
that the woman would be
permanently sterile.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.126
It's not totally clear whether
this was the policy that the

00:37:07.126 --> 00:37:08.360
government was really behind.
 

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.250
This was the procedure that the
government was doing,

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:13.521
but the press picked up and it
was a very big press thing in

00:37:13.521 --> 00:37:17.380
China,
and it was very much followed

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:19.119
by the people.
 

00:37:19.119 --> 00:37:22.715
The very small ecological
movement in China really got

00:37:22.715 --> 00:37:26.583
worried that in China--that
frogs would go extinct because

00:37:26.583 --> 00:37:29.230
people are eating all the
tadpoles.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:32.309
Finally the Chinese Academy of
Science took it up,

00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:34.550
got the statistics,
did some experiments,

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:36.619
I don't know exactly what they
did but they said,

00:37:36.619 --> 00:37:38.679
no this doesn't work.
 

00:37:38.679 --> 00:37:42.829
Go back to drawing board,
what are we going to do.

00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:45.951
So, the next round 1957/1958
was to use acupuncture as a

00:37:45.951 --> 00:37:46.860
contraceptive.
 

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.603
Remember acupuncture in China
has never been used for the

00:37:49.603 --> 00:37:51.760
kinds of things that it is used
for here,

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.420
and there's no evidence of any
effect from this for anything

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.992
except the spread of hepatitis
because the needles weren't

00:37:56.992 --> 00:37:57.670
sterilized.
 

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:59.989
You can see that throughout
Asia.

00:37:59.989 --> 00:38:03.188
I may have mentioned this in a
previous lecture,

00:38:03.188 --> 00:38:06.320
so they said OK let's try it
for contraception,

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:10.199
and of course that didn't work
any better whatsoever.

00:38:14.518 --> 00:38:16.501
Politically,
the government,

00:38:16.501 --> 00:38:20.686
again it was a very new thing
and the traditional Marxists

00:38:20.686 --> 00:38:24.650
were still opposed to family
planning that other,

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:26.059
more modern aspects of the
government were in favor of,

00:38:26.059 --> 00:38:28.860
so the government was uncertain
and divided on this.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:32.510
But, in 1956 the Premier,
Zhou En-lai,

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:36.036
at the time a very powerful
guy, urged limitations on

00:38:36.036 --> 00:38:40.106
childbirth and he was supported
by influential economists who

00:38:40.106 --> 00:38:43.769
were very much influenced by
Western ideas from Malthus

00:38:43.769 --> 00:38:46.969
onward,
Western ideas on population.

00:38:46.969 --> 00:38:51.170
The very next year--so in 1956
was when they started all this,

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:53.380
really trying to push birth
control,

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:56.539
the very next year there was
one of the Chinese purges.

00:38:56.539 --> 00:39:00.072
In 1957 they had the
campaign--what they called the

00:39:00.072 --> 00:39:03.367
anti-rightist campaign --
and people who were too

00:39:03.367 --> 00:39:06.286
influenced by Western ideas,
and Western economic ideas,

00:39:06.286 --> 00:39:08.989
remember Malthus was considered
the father of Western economics,

00:39:08.989 --> 00:39:16.989
were purged and with them went
the family planning campaign.

00:39:16.989 --> 00:39:21.507
In the end, the early back and
forthing on family planning came

00:39:21.507 --> 00:39:23.867
to no effect;
there were no methods,

00:39:23.867 --> 00:39:27.155
no trained family planning
personnel, and no facilities in

00:39:27.155 --> 00:39:29.750
rural areas, and no tradition of
anything.

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:33.588
In 1958, the Party started
organizing communes,

00:39:33.588 --> 00:39:37.679
and you probably know a fair
amount about them.

00:39:37.679 --> 00:39:41.576
These were giant agricultural
enterprises with something like

00:39:41.576 --> 00:39:43.980
5,000 families in a single
commune.

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:47.594
Commune meaning all the
production from all the farmland

00:39:47.594 --> 00:39:51.010
owned by 5,000 families was
pooled, and they produced

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:53.639
together and they consumed
together.

00:39:53.639 --> 00:39:56.159
That particular summer,
for climatic reasons,

00:39:56.159 --> 00:39:58.469
the harvest turned out to be
excellent,

00:39:58.469 --> 00:40:02.016
and, as the data came in,
the leaders of communist China

00:40:02.016 --> 00:40:05.630
at the time decided that the
communes were the answer.

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:07.855
"Look at how well we've
done under this commune

00:40:07.855 --> 00:40:08.510
system."
 

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:11.152
And the cadres,
the lower down cadres who were

00:40:11.152 --> 00:40:15.030
going to be rewarded or punished
depending on their production,

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:20.469
they of course inflated figures
wildly and they claimed that

00:40:20.469 --> 00:40:25.320
rural production had doubled,
had increased tenfold,

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.480
or even scores of times.
 

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.778
It was really--there was indeed
a good harvest,

00:40:30.778 --> 00:40:34.867
but then that got inflated
enormously due to the--shall we

00:40:34.867 --> 00:40:37.449
say, the weak political process.
 

00:40:37.449 --> 00:40:44.909
In 1958 after a couple of years
of trying this--

00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:48.909
officially pushing family
planning but without any real

00:40:48.909 --> 00:40:51.885
policy that worked,
and with getting rid of the

00:40:51.885 --> 00:40:53.679
rightists who were in favor of
it,

00:40:53.679 --> 00:40:55.730
in 1958 they reversed again.
 

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:59.081
They went away from family
planning and they said the

00:40:59.081 --> 00:41:01.476
central--
the communist party's central

00:41:01.476 --> 00:41:05.141
committee said in 1958 that the
communes were so successful that

00:41:05.141 --> 00:41:08.340
'China no longer had to worry
about overpopulation'.

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:11.405
To the contrary,
the forthcoming problem would

00:41:11.405 --> 00:41:14.811
be "not so much
overpopulation as the shortage

00:41:14.811 --> 00:41:16.309
of manpower."
 

00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:18.639
Basically what they got carried
away with,

00:41:18.639 --> 00:41:20.980
Jonathan Spence,
in his history of China,

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:23.750
talks about this,
and says, "the vision of

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:26.340
utopia was altogether
intoxicating".

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:30.146
Whenever your view of the world
gets out of kilter with the

00:41:30.146 --> 00:41:33.023
reality,
disaster is right behind and

00:41:33.023 --> 00:41:37.559
the disaster is indeed not far
behind and that was the Great

00:41:37.559 --> 00:41:38.789
Leap Forward.
 

00:41:38.789 --> 00:41:41.753
The context of the Great Leap
Forward is that the U.S.,

00:41:41.753 --> 00:41:44.114
in particular,
had threatened China and been

00:41:44.114 --> 00:41:47.248
threatening China with nuclear,
basically annihilation,

00:41:47.248 --> 00:41:50.271
and Mao had answered with this:
'I have so many people if you

00:41:50.271 --> 00:41:52.639
kill a couple of hundred million
who cares';

00:41:52.639 --> 00:41:58.710
very brutal response and
counter response.

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:01.181
The answer, Mao and everybody
in China knew,

00:42:01.181 --> 00:42:04.804
was to industrialize as fast as
they possibly can to catch up to

00:42:04.804 --> 00:42:06.530
America in military might.
 

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:10.516
He decided that China was not
industrializing fast enough and

00:42:10.516 --> 00:42:13.840
had to catch up to the Western
level right away.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:17.630
He told--he ordered--the orders
went out from the central

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:22.030
bureaucracy to put all of their
efforts into industrialization.

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:24.304
Forget about farming,
we have plenty of food,

00:42:24.304 --> 00:42:26.425
the communes are producing
plenty of food,

00:42:26.425 --> 00:42:28.389
we don't have to worry about
that.

00:42:28.389 --> 00:42:33.416
In fact, in your backyard,
put iron smelters in,

00:42:33.416 --> 00:42:39.940
build little furnaces and smelt
your iron in your backyard.

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:43.050
People didn't have any iron
ore, so what they did,

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:45.579
they took their pots and pans,
put them into a smelter,

00:42:45.579 --> 00:42:47.800
then they took their farm
implements and put them into the

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.190
smelter.
 

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:50.588
If you're from China,
do you remember your parents or

00:42:50.588 --> 00:42:52.250
somebody talking about these
days?

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:55.639
Again you do;
we don't have too many

00:42:55.639 --> 00:42:58.420
native-borns here,
but it was very,

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:03.409
very big, the backyard iron and
it resulted in two things.

00:43:03.409 --> 00:43:06.577
One, when you destroy
agricultural implements your

00:43:06.577 --> 00:43:10.391
agriculture really does go to
hell and the iron that you can

00:43:10.391 --> 00:43:13.559
smelt in the backyard is not
very good iron,

00:43:13.559 --> 00:43:15.869
so it's not very--actually very
useful.

00:43:15.869 --> 00:43:19.650
The side result is that
agriculture production crashed,

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:21.119
absolutely crashed.
 

00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:23.844
At the same time,
as part of the communes,

00:43:23.844 --> 00:43:27.699
the communal kitchens were
established where everyone could

00:43:27.699 --> 00:43:28.829
eat together.
 

00:43:28.829 --> 00:43:32.010
The purpose of--the original
purpose was twofold.

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:35.309
One they wanted--Chinese work
very hard to modernize the

00:43:35.309 --> 00:43:37.141
country,
to build up the country,

00:43:37.141 --> 00:43:39.876
and each family going home for
lunch and dinner is a huge

00:43:39.876 --> 00:43:42.219
amount of labor involved in
preparing meals,

00:43:42.219 --> 00:43:45.188
especially with a fairly
primitive food cooking and

00:43:45.188 --> 00:43:47.469
gathering,
preparing technology.

00:43:47.469 --> 00:43:50.922
If you have a staff dedicated
for food and you make food for

00:43:50.922 --> 00:43:53.987
thousands of people,
it can be done very efficiently

00:43:53.987 --> 00:43:56.557
in terms of time,
it's economically a very

00:43:56.557 --> 00:43:58.139
efficient sort of thing.
 

00:43:58.139 --> 00:44:01.572
It also was a pro-feminist
measure that who had to do the

00:44:01.572 --> 00:44:03.349
work at home was the women.
 

00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:06.432
The women were working in the
fields, then the men could come

00:44:06.432 --> 00:44:08.746
home and relax,
but the women had to then take

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:10.699
care of the children and the
food.

00:44:10.699 --> 00:44:14.072
It was both an economic
rationalization measure and it

00:44:14.072 --> 00:44:15.920
was a pro-feminist measure.
 

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.780
The result was that consumption
soared.

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:22.577
Traditionally,
like all poor people around the

00:44:22.577 --> 00:44:26.246
world, the Chinese were very
abstemious, every grain of rice

00:44:26.246 --> 00:44:26.929
counts.
 

00:44:26.929 --> 00:44:30.219
In a poor family,
if there's food available,

00:44:30.219 --> 00:44:33.380
you eat just exactly what you
need to stay alive,

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:36.230
and you store away the rest for
the future,

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:38.550
because the future is always
very uncertain.

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:41.646
When you have a communal
kitchen, it doesn't do any good

00:44:41.646 --> 00:44:44.800
to not eat your fill because,
if you don't eat your fill,

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.039
someone else will.
 

00:44:46.039 --> 00:44:48.777
There's no individual
accounting, no individual

00:44:48.777 --> 00:44:51.737
responsibility,
so everyone ate a lot and

00:44:51.737 --> 00:44:56.195
consumption soared at just the
time that production is going

00:44:56.195 --> 00:44:56.800
down.
 

00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:02.780
The concatenation of those two
things was the disaster.

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.777
As the disaster unfolded,
China was sufficiently

00:45:06.777 --> 00:45:11.882
authoritarian at the time that
the cadres had to pass up good

00:45:11.882 --> 00:45:16.469
news to the higher levels,
so news of the disaster that

00:45:16.469 --> 00:45:20.717
was unfolding before the local
people's eyes was not passed up

00:45:20.717 --> 00:45:22.110
to higher levels.
 

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:25.871
Apparently the higher levels
really believed that the--that

00:45:25.871 --> 00:45:29.440
agriculture was keeping up with
all this consumption.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.862
The higher levels only
received, and especially Mao,

00:45:31.862 --> 00:45:34.523
received only glowing reports
of production--agricultural

00:45:34.523 --> 00:45:36.139
production in the countryside.
 

00:45:36.139 --> 00:45:40.286
What happened was the great
famine of the great leap

00:45:40.286 --> 00:45:41.099
forward.
 

00:45:41.099 --> 00:45:45.793
Several hundred million people
became undernourished during

00:45:45.793 --> 00:45:48.949
this period, and then people
starved;

00:45:48.949 --> 00:45:52.289
source of undernourishment and
then people starved.

00:45:52.289 --> 00:45:55.690
Massive famines from 1959 to
1961;

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:59.449
we don't know how many people
died in these famines.

00:45:59.449 --> 00:46:03.771
The estimates are 20,30,
40,50 million people dying of

00:46:03.771 --> 00:46:07.360
starvation, but what it was we
don't know.

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:11.420
This is--let me show you the
other one first.

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:14.744
This is an old--this is world
population and you can go back

00:46:14.744 --> 00:46:17.842
further, except for the
black--there's no other--you see

00:46:17.842 --> 00:46:18.969
that blip there?
 

00:46:18.969 --> 00:46:23.427
That's the Great Leap Forward
in China as part of world

00:46:23.427 --> 00:46:24.500
population.
 

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.699
There is--if you carry world
population back further you

00:46:27.699 --> 00:46:30.840
don't see any blip like that
except the Black Death.

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:34.440
All the other disasters are not
comparable to this.

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:38.786
This shows sort of a Western
estimate going from something

00:46:38.786 --> 00:46:41.760
like loss of 30 or 40 million
people.

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:46.338
The official Chinese statistics
show the death rate going from

00:46:46.338 --> 00:46:49.494
10 million to 25 million,
and you have to look at the

00:46:49.494 --> 00:46:52.617
area because there's one,
two, three years of it so

00:46:52.617 --> 00:46:57.170
they're estimating more like
maybe 25 million deaths,

00:46:57.170 --> 00:46:59.050
that's the official Chinese
statistics.

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:04.199
Of course in that extreme
poverty, the birthrate just

00:47:04.199 --> 00:47:10.340
crashes and then recovers when
food becomes available again.

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:14.762
So the moral of the story is
that the Chinese seem to

00:47:14.762 --> 00:47:18.760
have--in the early stages of the
commune system,

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:22.760
the Chinese seem to have
eradicated famine.

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.436
They had had 115 years of
miserable history,

00:47:25.436 --> 00:47:28.797
the Communists come in,
things get better very quickly,

00:47:28.797 --> 00:47:29.670
very fast.
 

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:34.128
They decide they have the
answer, they decide they don't

00:47:34.128 --> 00:47:39.154
have to pay attention to basic
realities like population and so

00:47:39.154 --> 00:47:42.639
they get a very unreal view of
reality.

00:47:42.639 --> 00:47:45.690
Meanwhile, the country is
actually still walking on the

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:48.331
edge of disaster,
before they were under the edge

00:47:48.331 --> 00:47:50.869
and falling off to disaster
before the revolution,

00:47:50.869 --> 00:47:52.760
after the revolution they were
still on the edge,

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.010
but that wasn't realized.
 

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:58.157
So it was stupidity,
a political mistake pushes them

00:47:58.157 --> 00:48:02.630
over the edge and you have this
huge amount of death.

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:07.391
You should be aware that when
people talk about environmental

00:48:07.391 --> 00:48:11.599
limits what happens with
population and the world,

00:48:11.599 --> 00:48:14.550
that there are all kinds of
physical limits to the number of

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:15.000
people.
 

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.960
The most delicate thing that
humans make are their social and

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.610
political arrangements.
 

00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:24.735
When things get very tight it's
almost always not an underlying

00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:27.730
fundamental resource problem or
something,

00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:30.690
it's peoples political response
to it,

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:34.646
their interpersonal response to
it that goes out of whack and

00:48:34.646 --> 00:48:38.338
they start making massive
mistakes like this and then the

00:48:38.338 --> 00:48:39.789
world falls apart.
 

00:48:39.789 --> 00:48:43.724
It's the political and social
arrangements that people make

00:48:43.724 --> 00:48:47.525
with each other that are the
most delicate and population

00:48:47.525 --> 00:48:51.530
stress will usually have its
disaster effects through--

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:55.360
acting through the political
and social arrangements.

00:49:00.059 --> 00:49:02.860
Then the Chinese did not have
any rest after this.

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:06.800
From the Great Leap Forward to
the 1960s -- in the early 1960s

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:10.030
got transformed into the
Cultural Revolution of the

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.420
mid-60s and there was more
chaos.

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:16.070
After the great famine the
government learned its lesson

00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:19.789
and again tried to institute
birth control flip flop,

00:49:19.789 --> 00:49:24.018
flip flop, and again the method
was largely propaganda.

00:49:24.018 --> 00:49:28.019
The kind of propaganda this
time was aimed a lot at men and

00:49:28.019 --> 00:49:32.019
the kind of things that the
Chinese press were touting were

00:49:32.019 --> 00:49:35.204
men before the age of 25--
remember again it's a

00:49:35.204 --> 00:49:37.329
restriction on the young men
from sex--

00:49:37.329 --> 00:49:41.161
were described as if you have
sex "excessive dissipation

00:49:41.161 --> 00:49:44.768
of bodily fluids,
sexual neurasthenia,

00:49:44.768 --> 00:49:47.679
low spirits,
headaches,

00:49:47.679 --> 00:49:51.699
discomfort all over the body,
emaciation,

00:49:51.699 --> 00:49:54.090
dizziness, tension,
memory loss,

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:58.215
premature old age,
mental and physical pain,

00:49:58.215 --> 00:50:00.320
and impotence."
 

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.226
Now I've heard this from
students as their problems but

00:50:03.226 --> 00:50:05.650
they usually now attribute to
lack of sex,

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:09.119
but the Chinese at that time
were attributing it to sex,

00:50:09.119 --> 00:50:12.809
so you take your chances.
 

00:50:12.809 --> 00:50:17.436
Nevertheless,
the situation in the cities was

00:50:17.436 --> 00:50:21.952
such that the conditions,
the housing scarcity,

00:50:21.952 --> 00:50:24.650
the poverty were such that
people,

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:28.992
indeed in the cities,
did reduce their fertility and

00:50:28.992 --> 00:50:31.807
by 19--
somewhere in 1964 or 1966

00:50:31.807 --> 00:50:36.643
window, the urban fertility
dropped to a low of three births

00:50:36.643 --> 00:50:37.710
per woman.
 

00:50:41.429 --> 00:50:46.099
By 1974, urban non-agricultural
women,

00:50:46.099 --> 00:50:51.030
their fertility was reduced to
replacement level,

00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:53.867
so, rather rapidly,
urban fertility came down and

00:50:53.867 --> 00:50:58.769
it's continued to come down,
and in 1980 it was 1.1;

00:50:58.769 --> 00:51:03.050
very low urban fertility.
 

00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:06.315
During the Cultural Revolution
it had remained very high

00:51:06.315 --> 00:51:09.699
because it was chaos and nobody
was watching the store.

00:51:09.699 --> 00:51:14.360
In 1970 it was 6.4 among rural
women,

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:18.400
6.4 children which is basically
the traditional number from way,

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:22.498
way back and so there was
basically no conscious fertility

00:51:22.498 --> 00:51:24.800
control among the rural women.
 

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:31.179
By 1969 the population passed
800 million and in 1970,

00:51:31.179 --> 00:51:34.018
21% of births,
one out of five were first

00:51:34.018 --> 00:51:37.016
births,
17% almost the same were second

00:51:37.016 --> 00:51:40.666
births,
but 62% were third or higher

00:51:40.666 --> 00:51:44.931
order births in 1970,
so almost everyone was having

00:51:44.931 --> 00:51:46.429
three or more children.
 

00:51:46.429 --> 00:51:50.869
When political stability was
finally restored after the

00:51:50.869 --> 00:51:55.143
disruption of the Great Leap
Forward and the Cultural

00:51:55.143 --> 00:51:57.585
Revolution,
the government really

00:51:57.585 --> 00:52:00.121
introduced a serious,
vigorous family planning

00:52:00.121 --> 00:52:00.610
program.
 

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:04.891
Starting in 1971 they
introduced the Wan,

00:52:04.891 --> 00:52:08.179
Xhi Shao;
later, longer, fewer.

00:52:08.179 --> 00:52:12.266
What they proposed was later
marriage, longer birth

00:52:12.266 --> 00:52:16.110
intervals, leading to fewer
children overall.

00:52:19.889 --> 00:52:23.751
This was propagandized very
heavily but this is debatable,

00:52:23.751 --> 00:52:27.275
but there was generally
considered to be not an awful

00:52:27.275 --> 00:52:29.239
lot of coercion involved.
 

00:52:29.239 --> 00:52:33.320
It was more or less a voluntary
campaign.

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:39.489
I want to show you one graph if
I can--okay here's a graph of

00:52:39.489 --> 00:52:45.351
the total fertility rate in
China and I have taken out the

00:52:45.351 --> 00:52:46.380
years.
 

00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:48.539
I'll show you the years in a
minute.

00:52:48.539 --> 00:52:50.789
When do you think--so you had
the Wan,

00:52:50.789 --> 00:52:54.304
Xi, Shao, the voluntary policy,
and then that lasted for about

00:52:54.304 --> 00:52:57.820
ten years and then you had the
one-child policy which was,

00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.436
at least in the beginning,
not very voluntary and you've

00:53:00.436 --> 00:53:01.340
heard about that?
 

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:05.539
Where do you think the
one-child policy starts?

00:53:05.539 --> 00:53:07.500
Where in this graph?
 

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:13.139
To show you the effectiveness
of political programs.

00:53:13.139 --> 00:53:14.590
No idea.
 

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:16.909
Well it was--do you think the
one child policy was effective?

00:53:16.909 --> 00:53:18.579
Student:  Yes.
 

00:53:18.579 --> 00:53:21.670
Prof: Yes,
therefore you put it--

00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:23.670
Student:  I don't know
where I'd put it.

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:24.730
Prof: Make a guess.
 

00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:30.079
I know you don't have--right
about there maybe.

00:53:30.079 --> 00:53:34.530
That's the Great Leap Forward
decline.

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:37.980
The one-child policy starts
here, levels off,

00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:42.451
this decline,
taking about ten years was

00:53:42.451 --> 00:53:48.411
during the Wan Xi Shao period
during the more or less

00:53:48.411 --> 00:53:50.820
voluntary period.
 

00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:54.559
That the big drop in Chinese
fertility happens here and then

00:53:54.559 --> 00:53:58.045
they introduce the one-child
policy actually right about

00:53:58.045 --> 00:54:00.213
here,
well I'll just show you the

00:54:00.213 --> 00:54:01.010
actual dates.
 

00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:03.860
Here's 1980,
the one child policy is

00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:07.206
introduced here,
and immediately the fertility

00:54:07.206 --> 00:54:10.860
rises and then stabilizes and
I'll show you later eventually

00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:13.710
it does slow down for all kinds
of reasons.

00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:17.887
Let me go back,
the important thing to know is

00:54:17.887 --> 00:54:22.641
that it was the 19--
that the drop is 1970 to 1980,

00:54:22.641 --> 00:54:25.967
in this ten years,
the ten years before the

00:54:25.967 --> 00:54:30.304
one-child policy,
is when Chinese fertility

00:54:30.304 --> 00:54:34.320
really took this enormous drop.
 

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:39.619
What happened was until the
1970s, as I've described,

00:54:39.619 --> 00:54:42.856
there were really no family
planning services in the vast

00:54:42.856 --> 00:54:46.324
rural areas and only limited
facilities in a few of the large

00:54:46.324 --> 00:54:46.960
cities.
 

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:49.237
Starting in the 1970s,
as part of this policy,

00:54:49.237 --> 00:54:51.110
contraceptives were made
available;

00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:56.099
a huge amount of propaganda was
made to counteract any taboos.

00:54:56.099 --> 00:54:59.297
Peasant people have a lot of
taboos, and established late

00:54:59.297 --> 00:55:02.380
marriage and the small family as
the desirable norm.

00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:10.789
This drop--we've seen drops
something like this fast since

00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:13.579
then, but this drop was,
at the time,

00:55:13.579 --> 00:55:16.760
just incredible to foreign
observers.

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:20.518
That, in one decade,
to go down from six to half

00:55:20.518 --> 00:55:22.692
your--
more than half your fertility

00:55:22.692 --> 00:55:25.974
this is about 2.5 in one decade,
in a place so vast and so

00:55:25.974 --> 00:55:28.349
traditional as China was at that
time,

00:55:28.349 --> 00:55:29.960
just unbelievable.
 

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:33.659
I mean it turned out to be true;
the Chinese statistics were

00:55:33.659 --> 00:55:35.610
indeed quite good on this.
 

00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:41.485
It shows what a family planning
program, in this case,

00:55:41.485 --> 00:55:46.916
introduced with the full effort
of the government,

00:55:46.916 --> 00:55:49.800
can really accomplish.
 

00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:53.568
Scholars said it's the most
extraordinary reduction in

00:55:53.568 --> 00:55:58.190
fertility in a large population
ever recorded in human history.

00:55:58.190 --> 00:56:02.309
In 1979 the results of the
second national census were

00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:06.972
released and it was clear that
the population was approaching

00:56:06.972 --> 00:56:08.760
one billion people.
 

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:11.528
Now to us nowadays,
we're used to hearing China as

00:56:11.528 --> 00:56:13.619
having more than a billion
people,

00:56:13.619 --> 00:56:15.947
but back then,
the idea of a single country

00:56:15.947 --> 00:56:19.050
having a billion people was
absolutely mind boggling,

00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:23.391
and remember 1979 was way
before the Chinese economic

00:56:23.391 --> 00:56:26.735
miracle,
so these were a billion very

00:56:26.735 --> 00:56:30.550
poor people that were going to
be on earth.

00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:33.360
As the Chinese saw it,
very explicitly saw it,

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:36.418
the population they had--they
had had very good economic

00:56:36.418 --> 00:56:38.201
gains,
nothing like the boom that

00:56:38.201 --> 00:56:41.134
happened later,
but they really had made good

00:56:41.134 --> 00:56:45.610
progress but they perceived that
population growth had eaten up

00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:47.199
all of their gains.
 

00:56:47.199 --> 00:56:51.114
For instance,
grain production increased an

00:56:51.114 --> 00:56:55.309
annual rate of 2.3% between 1957
and 1978,

00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:58.539
the year before the census,
but per capita consumption

00:56:58.539 --> 00:57:02.320
which had started extremely low
increased only 0.2% during this

00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:05.175
time,
so it's a very small--huge

00:57:05.175 --> 00:57:09.929
increase in production 2.3% per
year over a ten year--

00:57:09.929 --> 00:57:12.429
20 year period,
21 year period is very,

00:57:12.429 --> 00:57:15.768
very good but when your
population grows at nearly the

00:57:15.768 --> 00:57:19.737
same rate you end up with a very
tiny improvement in standard of

00:57:19.737 --> 00:57:20.429
living.
 

00:57:20.429 --> 00:57:24.483
Housing space increased by half
a billion square meters,

00:57:24.483 --> 00:57:27.432
on the home building,
a poor, small home,

00:57:27.432 --> 00:57:31.119
but something,
a half a billion square meters;

00:57:31.119 --> 00:57:32.530
a meter is like a square yard.
 

00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:37.315
Because--but the per capita
because the population grew,

00:57:37.315 --> 00:57:42.534
the per capita housing was down
from 4.5 square meters to 3.6

00:57:42.534 --> 00:57:44.449
meters per capita.
 

00:57:44.449 --> 00:57:49.251
Three meters is like 9 x 9 and
that was what the per capita

00:57:49.251 --> 00:57:53.835
housing;
down in this period of an

00:57:53.835 --> 00:57:56.690
improving economy.
 

00:57:56.690 --> 00:58:00.922
The arable land fell from a
quarter of an acre in 1949--from

00:58:00.922 --> 00:58:04.867
half an acre in 1949 to a
quarter of an acre in 1983 and

00:58:04.867 --> 00:58:07.018
it's gone down since then.
 

00:58:07.018 --> 00:58:09.829
Also, the government,
from the census,

00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:13.472
realized how young the
population was and a young

00:58:13.472 --> 00:58:16.889
population means,
what's going to happen?

00:58:16.889 --> 00:58:17.860
Student:  Speed.
 

00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:18.849
Prof: Momentum.
 

00:58:18.849 --> 00:58:22.195
There's so many more young
people coming into reproductive

00:58:22.195 --> 00:58:26.340
age than ones leaving it,
that you're going to have a lot

00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:29.809
more child bearers and they
realized this.

00:58:29.809 --> 00:58:34.768
From the 1982 census,
another census they took,

00:58:34.768 --> 00:58:38.306
the population period was 45
million women in their 40s

00:58:38.306 --> 00:58:43.297
leaving reproductive age,
60 million, 1/3 bigger in their

00:58:43.297 --> 00:58:46.166
30s,
80 million in their 20s,

00:58:46.166 --> 00:58:49.739
and 125 million women in their
teens.

00:58:49.739 --> 00:58:52.621
If the teens are coming--just
starting to come into

00:58:52.621 --> 00:58:55.791
reproductive ages that means
basically a tripling of the

00:58:55.791 --> 00:58:58.500
number of child bearing women
coming into--

00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:01.440
three times as many child
bearing women were coming into

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:04.219
reproductive age as were leaving
reproductive age.

00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:15.255
Even though they had achieved
this rather incredible fertility

00:59:15.255 --> 00:59:17.083
decline,
they realized that,

00:59:17.083 --> 00:59:20.518
because of the momentum,
their population would keep

00:59:20.518 --> 00:59:25.909
growing for decades yet and they
were really worried about it.

00:59:25.909 --> 00:59:29.954
At that time the TFR was
something 2.5 when they were

00:59:29.954 --> 00:59:32.289
deciding what to do with it.
 

00:59:32.289 --> 00:59:38.407
If you have--at this age
distribution at this time 2.5

00:59:38.407 --> 00:59:45.677
children per women and if three
times as many women are going to

00:59:45.677 --> 00:59:53.204
enter reproductive age,
what do you have to do to keep

00:59:53.204 --> 00:59:54.780
this down?
 

00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:56.539
You have to go--it's
mathematical--

00:59:56.539 --> 00:59:59.536
you have to have 1/3.-- When
you have three times as many

00:59:59.536 --> 01:00:02.532
women you have to have 1/3 the
number of births they were

01:00:02.532 --> 01:00:03.389
having here.
 

01:00:03.389 --> 01:00:06.465
Three times as many women to
keep the number of children the

01:00:06.465 --> 01:00:08.914
same, and you don't reduce the
number of babies,

01:00:08.914 --> 01:00:11.000
you have to reduce fertility by
1/3.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.389
So 2.5 divided by 3 is 0.8.
 

01:00:14.389 --> 01:00:17.920
So, the demographics of their
current fertility,

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:21.409
a low fertility,
rate--2.5, their current low

01:00:21.409 --> 01:00:25.454
fertility rate but the tripling
of women coming into

01:00:25.454 --> 01:00:28.485
reproductive ages,
the mathematics tells you,

01:00:28.485 --> 01:00:31.070
you have to set--
you have to somehow get your

01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:32.820
fertility rate down to 0.8.
 

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:36.603
They decided that was going to
be very difficult and they

01:00:36.603 --> 01:00:39.780
instituted the one-child policy
at that time.

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:42.498
At the lowest their birth rate
had ever been in,

01:00:42.498 --> 01:00:45.217
probably forever,
in Chinese history was exactly

01:00:45.217 --> 01:00:48.400
the time that they introduced
the one-child policy.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.590
Years after implementation
there were--

01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:55.117
in 1986 which was six years,
seven years after

01:00:55.117 --> 01:00:57.842
implementation,
there's still a million more

01:00:57.842 --> 01:01:00.409
births than there were the year
earlier,

01:01:00.409 --> 01:01:03.250
the number of births kept
rising.

01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:07.907
The policy was not a success in
the extreme sense that the

01:01:07.907 --> 01:01:10.929
Chinese government wanted it to
be.

01:01:10.929 --> 01:01:15.253
They wanted to keep the
year--in the year 2000 they

01:01:15.253 --> 01:01:19.750
wanted to keep their population
under 1.2 billion.

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:21.360
When they started this they
were approaching--

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:24.862
they were like 800 billion and
they were desperately hoping to

01:01:24.862 --> 01:01:27.789
keep it under 1.2 billion and
they didn't do it,

01:01:27.789 --> 01:01:32.969
it was 1.3 billion.
 

01:01:32.969 --> 01:01:39.380
On paper the policy was quite
Draconian.

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:42.822
In the 1982/1983 regulations
included each village would get

01:01:42.822 --> 01:01:46.148
a quota for the number of births
that year and the village

01:01:46.148 --> 01:01:49.300
leaders would have to ration
this out on the basis of a

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.409
waiting list.
 

01:01:50.409 --> 01:01:54.177
Of course only couples with no
prior children could get on the

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:54.610
list.
 

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:58.463
They had a mandatory IUD
insertion for women who already

01:01:58.463 --> 01:02:02.666
had one child and if a woman had
an unauthorized pregnancy an

01:02:02.666 --> 01:02:05.679
abortion was supposed to be
mandatory,

01:02:05.679 --> 01:02:08.219
and you heard the story about
that.

01:02:08.219 --> 01:02:09.768
Although, you should note,
that again,

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:13.311
it wasn't the government--the
abortion that Qing told you

01:02:13.311 --> 01:02:16.039
about had nothing to do--
in one sense had nothing

01:02:16.039 --> 01:02:17.699
immediately to do with the
government.

01:02:17.699 --> 01:02:20.800
She did the abortion way before
anybody knew about it,

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.579
her co-workers didn't know
about it,

01:02:22.579 --> 01:02:23.800
her workplace didn't know about
it,

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.190
government officials didn't
know about it,

01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:27.878
it was the suasion,
it was the effect from other

01:02:27.878 --> 01:02:29.663
people,
it was these village--these

01:02:29.663 --> 01:02:32.135
committees that would keep
visiting you and keep bugging

01:02:32.135 --> 01:02:35.273
you that caused her to say,
'okay I'm going to avoid all

01:02:35.273 --> 01:02:38.762
this pain and just have the
abortion right away,' so in a

01:02:38.762 --> 01:02:42.500
sense the government didn't have
to do anything about it.

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.838
With respect to abortion,
the statistics are very

01:02:44.838 --> 01:02:45.960
interesting in China.
 

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:51.518
Sometime, a little after this,
unmarried sexuality started

01:02:51.518 --> 01:02:54.023
happening;
in traditional China that--at

01:02:54.023 --> 01:02:56.139
least officially -- just plain
didn't happen.

01:02:56.139 --> 01:03:00.735
But, as the country modernizes,
one of the things you get into

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:02.619
is unmarried sexuality.
 

01:03:02.619 --> 01:03:05.708
Girls were getting pregnant in
an unmarried state and this was

01:03:05.708 --> 01:03:07.280
an unthinkable sort of thing.
 

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:10.367
What happened to those girls
that were pregnant and

01:03:10.367 --> 01:03:11.110
unmarried?
 

01:03:11.110 --> 01:03:15.639
Their parents forced them to
have an abortion.

01:03:15.639 --> 01:03:19.018
Some statistics show that the
number of abortions,

01:03:19.018 --> 01:03:22.268
which parents required of their
daughters,

01:03:22.268 --> 01:03:24.159
their unmarried pregnant
daughters to have,

01:03:24.159 --> 01:03:26.693
exceeded the number of
abortions forced under the

01:03:26.693 --> 01:03:28.844
one-child policy,
because the one-child policy

01:03:28.844 --> 01:03:32.067
also pushed contraceptives,
so actually--and contraceptives

01:03:32.067 --> 01:03:35.010
were decent,
so the number of abortions

01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:40.900
while high,
was not off the map.

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:44.476
The one-child policy proceeded
and there were--there's

01:03:44.476 --> 01:03:48.659
absolutely no doubt about it,
major human rights violations.

01:03:48.659 --> 01:03:51.539
You heard about one story,
forced sterilizations,

01:03:51.539 --> 01:03:54.536
forced abortions,
these absolutely happened and

01:03:54.536 --> 01:03:56.769
this was,
as you heard especially true of

01:03:56.769 --> 01:03:59.530
people who had government jobs
or worked in government owned

01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:02.150
factories and that was a big
fraction of the economy.

01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:06.271
Remember this was a socialist
state, and abortion was supposed

01:04:06.271 --> 01:04:08.907
to be mandatory,
and sterilization even,

01:04:08.907 --> 01:04:12.219
for any couple that had two or
more children.

01:04:12.219 --> 01:04:14.769
Student:  Did they have
orphanages at the time?

01:04:14.769 --> 01:04:15.599
Prof: Did they have?
 

01:04:15.599 --> 01:04:19.266
Student:  Orphanages or
was everything increasing the

01:04:19.266 --> 01:04:22.869
number of children dropped off
at these orphanages or--

01:04:22.869 --> 01:04:25.369
Prof: To adopted out
children.

01:04:25.369 --> 01:04:26.340
Student:  Right.
 

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:28.469
I mean just because--I mean a
lot of people weren't supposed

01:04:28.469 --> 01:04:31.090
to have more than one child,
so did people who didn't go

01:04:31.090 --> 01:04:34.586
through with an abortion,
and they were able to manage to

01:04:34.586 --> 01:04:38.710
have another child did they drop
their kid off at an orphanage?

01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:40.858
Prof: Yes I haven't--
yes I haven't seen good

01:04:40.858 --> 01:04:43.186
statistics about that and I
don't know if the Chinese

01:04:43.186 --> 01:04:45.289
government lets out good
statistics on that.

01:04:45.289 --> 01:04:49.550
A huge number of girls,
almost all girls,

01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:56.222
were sent to orphanages and
because of the poverty of the

01:04:56.222 --> 01:04:59.331
orphanages,
I mean it was lot of rural

01:04:59.331 --> 01:05:02.380
orphanages that didn't have much
money to begin with,

01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:04.070
they basically couldn't take
care of the babies,

01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:06.429
huge death rate,
huge maltreatment rate.

01:05:06.429 --> 01:05:09.934
This is when Americans started
adopting Chinese babies kind of

01:05:09.934 --> 01:05:13.552
en mass and many Americans went
over to pick up the baby and the

01:05:13.552 --> 01:05:16.713
stories that came back about
children just tied into the

01:05:16.713 --> 01:05:19.364
cribs,
emaciated, sores over the body

01:05:19.364 --> 01:05:22.000
and really in very,
very bad situations.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.005
Yes, indeed,
as far as we can tell but I

01:05:25.005 --> 01:05:29.244
don't have good statistics,
yes a big surge in daughters

01:05:29.244 --> 01:05:32.789
given--girl babies given up to
orphanages.

01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:42.768
Okay so in this--I guess it's
time to finish.

01:05:42.768 --> 01:05:45.335
We'll just have to continue
this next time,

01:05:45.335 --> 01:05:47.289
cutting into our next lecture.

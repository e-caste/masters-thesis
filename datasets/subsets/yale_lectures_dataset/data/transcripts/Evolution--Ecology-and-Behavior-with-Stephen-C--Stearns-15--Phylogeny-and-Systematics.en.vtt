00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:02.900
Prof: Very good.
 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.390
So today we're going to talk
about phylogenetics and

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.360
systematics, and the lecture has
this kind of structure.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.020
I'll remind you of what the
Tree of Life looks like.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.765
Then I will motivate the
lecture basically by giving you

00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:21.920
some surprising recent results
from molecular systematics,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.660
and then I will go into
basically what phylogenetic

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.550
concepts are and how to build a
phylogenetic tree.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.362
I won't do this in great
detail, but I hope I do enough

00:00:33.362 --> 00:00:37.739
of it so that you at least have
a good feel for the issues that

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.140
are involved when you do this.
 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.542
So this is the same picture of
the Tree of Life that I used

00:00:44.542 --> 00:00:49.105
earlier in the course,
and basically it shows you that

00:00:49.105 --> 00:00:52.200
since about 3.5 billion years
ago,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.360
there have been three large
clades that have developed.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:20.720
&lt;&lt;Technical
Adjustments&gt;&gt;

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.409
Take a moment and look at this
picture,

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.709
and look at the next one--which
is a--

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:33.810
this next one is essentially a
blowup of what's been going on

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.715
since about here--
and think about how much that

00:01:39.715 --> 00:01:42.370
tells us about biology.
 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.391
It provides a very basic
structure, the structure of

00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:46.340
relationships.
 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.753
It tells you which things
shared common ancestors,

00:01:49.753 --> 00:01:54.001
and why we might expect them to
be one way rather than another

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:54.560
way.
 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.230
It sets up thousands of
comparisons in our minds about

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.310
questions that we might ask.
 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.108
It provides an extremely
useful, overarching structure.

00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:08.634
But the question is,
how did phylogenetic biologists

00:02:08.634 --> 00:02:13.960
actually get this picture,
and are they still changing it?

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.217
And the answer is:
they got it with the methods of

00:02:17.217 --> 00:02:19.877
inference that I'm going to
sketch today,

00:02:19.877 --> 00:02:22.139
and they're still changing it.
 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:26.058
It's not written in stone and
it's been changing ever since

00:02:26.058 --> 00:02:29.370
the first time somebody tried to
write it down.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.650
So these things are working
hypotheses,

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.111
and we are able to get a better
and better refinement of them as

00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:43.591
new information comes in,
but there are significant

00:02:43.591 --> 00:02:44.330
changes.
 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.436
Now this is what Darwin had to
say in the Origin about

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.370
the Tree of Life.
 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.319
It's a truly wonderful fact,
the wonder of which we are apt

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.669
to overlook from familiarity,
that all animals and all

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:01.620
plants, throughout all time and
space,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.188
should be related to each other
in groups.

00:03:04.188 --> 00:03:07.210
And he goes on about how these
groups are hierarchical.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.293
He said, "The affinities
of all the beings of the same

00:03:10.293 --> 00:03:13.270
class have sometimes been
represented by a great tree.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.720
I believe this simile is
largely the truth."

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.503
So in this beautiful Victorian
prose, Darwin rhapsodizes a bit

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:26.661
about the Tree of Life,
and it was the only picture he

00:03:26.661 --> 00:03:28.229
had in his book.
 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.420
Okay?
 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.840
So he thought it was real
important.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.610
He made a sketch of it,
and by it, by this sketch,

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.812
he meant to indicate that a lot
of things had gone extinct and

00:03:38.812 --> 00:03:44.270
that through ancestry and shared
common ancestry you could define

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.720
relationship.
 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.181
Now he could see immediately
that the tree isn't given,

00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:50.848
it should be discovered.
 

00:03:50.848 --> 00:03:53.800
He said, "Our
classifications will come to be,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.810
as far as they can be so made,
genealogies;"

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.293
So they will reflect what
actually happened in terms of

00:04:00.293 --> 00:04:03.389
evolutionary history to generate
relationship;

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.231
"and then they will truly
give what may be called the plan

00:04:07.231 --> 00:04:08.098
of creation.
 

00:04:08.098 --> 00:04:11.337
The rules for classifying will
no doubt become simpler when we

00:04:11.337 --> 00:04:13.090
have a definite object in view.
 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.420
We possess no pedigree or
armorial bearings."

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.745
Okay?
 

00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:20.591
That's mid-nineteenth century
code for there's no barcode on

00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:21.569
the species.
 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.812
Okay?
 

00:04:21.812 --> 00:04:24.774
They're not wearing their name
on the forehead and they're not

00:04:24.774 --> 00:04:26.620
telling you who they're related
to.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.420
So we have to discover and
trace these diverging lines.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:38.274
Well it actually has taken a
long time for phylogenetics to

00:04:38.274 --> 00:04:43.240
settle on clear logic and clear
methods.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.649
Up until about oh somewhere
around 19--

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:53.904
the ideas were there but they
weren't really implemented until

00:04:53.904 --> 00:04:57.291
about 1965 to 1970,
and there ensued a huge

00:04:57.291 --> 00:05:01.160
controversy that lasted for
about twenty years.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.738
And now that all--the dust has
settled and that seems to be in

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:08.500
the past,
but many people actually my age

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.480
are still marked by it,
because we witnessed it.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.454
And I'm now going to more or
less summarize what came out of

00:05:16.454 --> 00:05:19.408
it,
but I just want to signal to

00:05:19.408 --> 00:05:23.596
you that this was,
in the not very distant past,

00:05:23.596 --> 00:05:27.269
an extremely controversial area
of science,

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:31.089
and that it was revolutionized
both by the advent of DNA

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:34.800
sequence data,
and by the development of

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.569
powerful mathematical and
computer methods for determining

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:43.733
relationship;
and there was an argument about

00:05:43.733 --> 00:05:45.029
which ones we should use.
 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:50.670
So the first step in that is
taken by a guy named Zimmermann,

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.812
and it's just sketched here,
and it seems very simple:

00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:59.579
Sharing a more recent common
ancestor defines relationship.

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:02.817
So magnolias and apple trees
are more closely related to each

00:06:02.817 --> 00:06:04.759
other than either is to a
gingko,

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:10.670
because this point on the tree
is later in time,

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.750
and connects them,
than this point on the tree,

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.899
which connects them to gingkoes.
 

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:17.810
It seems like a very simple
idea.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.704
It wasn't really clearly
articulated until Zimmermann

00:06:21.704 --> 00:06:24.550
laid it down as a principle in
1931.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.259
Now some of these concepts
you've already been through.

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:31.911
So I'm going to simply mention
these names again,

00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:36.553
just so that they get repeated
and start becoming part of your

00:06:36.553 --> 00:06:38.000
own vocabulary.
 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.800
Monophyletic is a group that
contains all of the descendants

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.151
from a single common ancestor
and nothing that is not

00:06:45.151 --> 00:06:47.730
descended from that common
ancestor;

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.370
paraphyletic groups are groups
that do not contain all of the

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.829
species descended from the most
recent common ancestor;

00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:58.716
and polyphyletic groups really
are a hodgepodge of stuff that

00:06:58.716 --> 00:07:01.050
shouldn't be in that sort of
bin,

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.610
under that category at all,
because they have--

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.016
basically independent
evolutionary lines are being

00:07:08.016 --> 00:07:09.490
incorrectly lumped together.
 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.226
The basis of a lot of this
inference is the concept of

00:07:17.226 --> 00:07:19.648
homology,
and homology and analogy--I'll

00:07:19.648 --> 00:07:22.327
repeat them in a minute when we
get to some slides that

00:07:22.327 --> 00:07:24.711
illustrate them--
but they were defined by

00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:27.439
Richard Owen in the early
nineteenth century,

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:29.949
before Darwin's Origin of
Species.

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:32.860
He was a great morphologist,
in London,

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.336
and basically the idea of
homology is that a trait is

00:07:36.336 --> 00:07:40.548
identical in two or more species
because they are descended from

00:07:40.548 --> 00:07:42.019
a common ancestor.
 

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:45.500
So they got it because their
ancestor had it.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.733
And homoplasy,
or convergence,

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:52.199
is similarity for any reason
other than common ancestry.

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:57.076
So convergence in morphological
traits, mutation to the same

00:07:57.076 --> 00:08:00.629
sequence, in DNA,
will lead to homoplasy.

00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:05.949
So homology is helpful,
and homoplasy is confusing in

00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:08.610
determining phylogenies.
 

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.199
So here's a good monophyletic
group.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:13.759
Okay? This is the dogs.
 

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:16.259
And here the dogs are.
 

00:08:16.259 --> 00:08:19.922
Here's Canis and Lycaon--so the
Lycaon is the African Hunting

00:08:19.922 --> 00:08:23.889
Dog--and their closest relatives
are the South American wolves.

00:08:23.889 --> 00:08:27.435
Canis, by the way,
Canis--the timber wolf is in

00:08:27.435 --> 00:08:31.077
the genus Canis,
and all domestic dogs are

00:08:31.077 --> 00:08:34.640
descended from wolves,
which is a nice example of

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.633
really rapid evolution;
take a wolf,

00:08:36.633 --> 00:08:39.059
turn it into a Saint Bernard
and a Chihuahua.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:40.240
I give you 5000 years.
 

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:40.980
Can you do it?
 

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.908
Well it takes pretty tough
breeding to do that,

00:08:43.908 --> 00:08:44.798
but you can.
 

00:08:44.798 --> 00:08:47.120
And, by the way,
I had a colleague--Armand

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.517
Kuris, who's at Santa Barbara,
decided he was going to create

00:08:50.517 --> 00:08:52.802
his own race;
he wanted to create the ugliest

00:08:52.802 --> 00:08:53.570
dog in the world.
 

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.250
He was going to name it the
Louisiana Swamp Dog.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.269
It took him six generations.
 

00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:59.529
I mean, this dog is really ugly.
 

00:08:59.529 --> 00:09:00.330
&gt;
 

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.340
But it's registered with the
American Kennel Club.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.230
So you can do rapid breeding
with dogs.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.735
That's, of course,
on a timescale up here that you

00:09:07.735 --> 00:09:10.701
couldn't even fit onto that
little white line at the top of

00:09:10.701 --> 00:09:11.519
the picture.
 

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:16.657
Interestingly,
all this stuff over here is

00:09:16.657 --> 00:09:17.908
extinct.
 

00:09:17.908 --> 00:09:19.940
There are a few little marks
here that are kind of

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:20.519
interesting.
 

00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:24.629
Out here, on the branch going
up to the Caninae,

00:09:24.629 --> 00:09:26.970
is digitigrady,
which means that at that point

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.090
they started chasing after
things that were running fast,

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.960
and evolution,
just like it did with horses,

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.830
started to cause them to be
selected to run on their toes.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.495
So they got longer legs by
running on their toe tips,

00:09:39.495 --> 00:09:42.950
rather than on the pads of
their feet directly.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:46.619
And bone cracking came in right
about here, so they could get

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:48.210
the marrow out of bones.
 

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.000
That's a good monophyletic
group.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.840
You probably can't see it up
there.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.710
I'll give you a little bit of
timeline.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:57.681
The whole thing starts taking
off about 40,000,000 years ago,

00:09:57.681 --> 00:09:58.740
in the Eocene.
 

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.644
And Canis, the dog genus
itself, is about 5,000,000 years

00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:05.580
old;
it's about as old as Homo.

00:10:09.639 --> 00:10:12.129
Okay, here are some
paraphyletic groups.

00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:17.970
Reptiles is paraphyletic.
 

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:18.399
Okay?
 

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:22.359
It's got turtles,
lizards and crocodiles in it,

00:10:22.359 --> 00:10:25.200
but it doesn't have the birds.
 

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.808
So reptiles is an inaccurate
term.

00:10:28.808 --> 00:10:31.403
This is the monophyletic
group--lizards,

00:10:31.403 --> 00:10:35.326
crocodiles and birds--and we
don't have an everyday language

00:10:35.326 --> 00:10:36.389
term for it.
 

00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:40.029
Crocodiles, by the way,
build nests and guard them,

00:10:40.029 --> 00:10:42.120
and when the baby crocodiles
hatch out,

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.875
they cheep like birds:
"cheep,

00:10:44.875 --> 00:10:46.009
cheep."
 

00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:51.458
So there are--this relationship
between crocs and birds is well

00:10:51.458 --> 00:10:52.690
established.
 

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.048
Here's a polyphyletic group.
 

00:10:55.048 --> 00:10:59.027
If we define a group called the
homoeothermic tetrapods,

00:10:59.027 --> 00:11:01.918
it contains the birds and the
mammals.

00:11:01.918 --> 00:11:06.721
But look at all of the things
that are more closely related to

00:11:06.721 --> 00:11:09.320
the birds than the mammals are.
 

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.755
So if we were to define the
birds and the mammals as a

00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:13.850
group,
it would be a false group,

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.727
because phylogenetically the
birds have many things which are

00:11:17.727 --> 00:11:21.090
more closely related to them
than the mammals do.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.730
And this group is polyphyletic.
 

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:22.986
Okay?
 

00:11:22.986 --> 00:11:25.509
It has contributions from two
different sources.

00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:28.542
Another good example of a
polyphyletic group would be if

00:11:28.542 --> 00:11:31.849
you decided to link together all
of the things that look like

00:11:31.849 --> 00:11:34.110
cactuses in Africa and South
America.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.833
The ones in South America are
cactuses, but the ones in Africa

00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:41.048
are euphorbs;
they look just like cactuses.

00:11:41.048 --> 00:11:43.149
There's a nice example in the
Peabody Museum.

00:11:43.149 --> 00:11:45.759
You can look at them sitting
next to each other.

00:11:45.759 --> 00:11:46.226
Okay?
 

00:11:46.226 --> 00:11:48.928
That's a polyphyletic group.
 

00:11:48.928 --> 00:11:53.058
They are convergent,
they came together.

00:11:53.058 --> 00:11:56.544
Similarly, the homeothermy in
the birds and mammals is

00:11:56.544 --> 00:11:57.399
convergent.
 

00:11:57.399 --> 00:12:01.450
The ancestor back here did not
have warm blood.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.764
It evolved twice,
once in the line to mammals and

00:12:04.764 --> 00:12:06.700
once in the line to birds.
 

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.030
I know there were some-warm
blooded dinosaurs,

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.120
but that was later.
 

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.375
Warm-bloodedness probably came
in, in this line,

00:12:13.375 --> 00:12:17.379
about here somewhere;
don't know exactly.

00:12:17.379 --> 00:12:23.490
Then this central concept,
homology.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.634
Here are the forelimbs of
turtles, humans,

00:12:26.634 --> 00:12:29.090
horses, birds,
bats and seals.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:33.721
So we've got some stuff here
that's spanning quite a bit of

00:12:33.721 --> 00:12:38.091
the tetrapods;
vertebrates that are living on

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:38.710
land.
 

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:44.221
And you can see that it's
possible to match up sections of

00:12:44.221 --> 00:12:48.090
these structures,
all the way through.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:52.548
And actually if you study that,
and you realize that they were

00:12:52.548 --> 00:12:55.620
all in an ancestral condition
together,

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.759
you can see how evolution has
changed their proportions,

00:12:58.759 --> 00:13:02.129
changed their thickness,
but it hasn't changed their

00:13:02.129 --> 00:13:04.639
spatial relationships to each
other.

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:05.971
And, in fact,
if you go through the

00:13:05.971 --> 00:13:07.985
development,
you'll discover that the same

00:13:07.985 --> 00:13:10.738
nerves coming out of the
backbone are running to the same

00:13:10.738 --> 00:13:13.541
parts of the limb,
and all of those conditions

00:13:13.541 --> 00:13:16.658
have been held together,
over evolutionary time.

00:13:16.658 --> 00:13:19.471
And if you look at the HOX
genes that are controlling their

00:13:19.471 --> 00:13:20.977
development,
you can see,

00:13:20.977 --> 00:13:24.028
as you saw in a lecture a
little bit earlier,

00:13:24.028 --> 00:13:26.730
that the DNA sequences in the
HOX genes,

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.798
that are telling it whether to
make a humerus,

00:13:29.798 --> 00:13:34.620
a radius, an ulna or digits,
are actually homologous in

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.210
their DNA sequence as well.
 

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:41.466
So there's a molecular homology
that underlies the morphological

00:13:41.466 --> 00:13:42.210
homology.
 

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.009
And if you look at molecular
sequences,

00:13:45.009 --> 00:13:47.558
here's a gene called aniridia
in humans,

00:13:47.558 --> 00:13:50.580
and a gene called eye-less in
fruit flies,

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.330
and only six--these are not DNA
sequences,

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.542
this is protein sequence;
so these are amino acids--only

00:13:58.542 --> 00:14:01.450
six of the sixty amino acids are
different.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.908
The two sequences are 90%
identical.

00:14:03.908 --> 00:14:07.028
There are search algorithms,
like BLAST, that go out and

00:14:07.028 --> 00:14:09.240
look for these sorts of
similarities.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.750
So that if you get a candidate
gene or a candidate protein

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.076
sequence,
it's possible simply to put a

00:14:14.076 --> 00:14:16.363
search term in,
to a search engine,

00:14:16.363 --> 00:14:19.480
and have other genes from other
species pop up.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.409
So you can look for molecular
homology that way.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:31.000
A good molecular homology is
the fruit fly homeobox complex

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.325
and the human HOX complex--
we talked about this

00:14:35.325 --> 00:14:40.720
earlier--where the sequence of
the genes along the chromosome,

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.504
and the parts of the body that
are being controlled by those

00:14:44.504 --> 00:14:48.623
genes developmentally,
are similar in humans and in

00:14:48.623 --> 00:14:52.035
fruit flies,
and actually unite everything

00:14:52.035 --> 00:14:53.450
that you see here.
 

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:56.570
So this sort of thing is a
signal of shared ancestry,

00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:00.110
and it's the kind of molecular
information used to construct

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:01.850
the broader Tree of Life.
 

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.865
So this is something that is
linking together arthropods,

00:15:04.865 --> 00:15:07.450
annelids, mollusks,
echinoderms and chordates.

00:15:12.029 --> 00:15:13.639
Now analogy.
 

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:18.690
Analogy or convergence is a
misleading kind of information,

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:23.317
because that means that natural
selection has taken things that

00:15:23.317 --> 00:15:28.457
were evolutionarily independent,
and which have sister groups,

00:15:28.457 --> 00:15:32.187
have relatives,
that don't look anything like

00:15:32.187 --> 00:15:34.881
this,
and then shaped both of those

00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:38.000
things to come together to a
common form.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.043
So the dolphin and the
ichthyosaur have a very similar

00:15:42.043 --> 00:15:44.892
fusiform body,
and this is because of strong

00:15:44.892 --> 00:15:48.317
selection to swim rapidly in the
ocean and to chase down fish and

00:15:48.317 --> 00:15:51.350
squid;
which they both did.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:55.110
And the analogy goes deeper
than that.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:59.248
As you probably know,
the dolphin has live birth,

00:15:59.248 --> 00:16:00.799
it's viviparous.
 

00:16:00.799 --> 00:16:02.658
So is the ichthyosaur.
 

00:16:02.658 --> 00:16:06.860
If you go to a striking museum,
just south of Tübingen,

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.506
in Germany, and look at the
world's largest collection of

00:16:09.506 --> 00:16:13.250
pregnant ichthyosaurs,
you can see an ichthyosaur that

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.710
was giving birth at the point
when it was fossilized.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:23.168
And they often had twins,
or triplets.

00:16:23.168 --> 00:16:28.798
So the definition of analogy is
two things that look very much

00:16:28.798 --> 00:16:31.638
alike,
even though they have many

00:16:31.638 --> 00:16:36.041
relatives that look quite
different and are distant on the

00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:36.658
tree.
 

00:16:36.658 --> 00:16:40.304
So the dolphin is more closely
related to a kangaroo than it is

00:16:40.304 --> 00:16:43.259
to an ichthyosaur,
and an ichthyosaur is more

00:16:43.259 --> 00:16:47.100
closely related to a hummingbird
than it is to a dolphin;

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.480
nevertheless they look similar.
 

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.570
So that's analogy.
 

00:16:52.928 --> 00:16:59.470
So once people got their DNA
sequences and their logic under

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.302
control,
and they started doing a lot of

00:17:02.302 --> 00:17:04.700
molecular systematics,
they discovered some

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.288
relationships that were kind of
surprising,

00:17:07.288 --> 00:17:09.740
because analogy,
convergence,

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.980
had been covering up
relationship,

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:17.255
or because evolution had so
radically changed the external

00:17:17.255 --> 00:17:21.430
appearance of these creatures,
that it was very difficult to

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.190
see who they were related to.
 

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.519
Here are a few of these
insights.

00:17:25.519 --> 00:17:29.396
I'll bet that if I ask Alex or
Jeremy or Katie or the other

00:17:29.396 --> 00:17:32.740
teaching fellows if they've got
a favorite one,

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.680
that they could probably come
up with others as well.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.799
Maybe I will in a minute;
so start thinking.

00:17:37.799 --> 00:17:39.858
Okay?
 

00:17:39.858 --> 00:17:44.212
Pentastomids were a mysterious
group of creatures,

00:17:44.212 --> 00:17:49.098
and they turn out to be closely
related to fish lice.

00:17:49.098 --> 00:17:52.038
I'll show you a pentastomid in
a minute.

00:17:52.038 --> 00:17:54.529
There used to be a group called
carnivorous plants,

00:17:54.529 --> 00:17:56.108
the pitcher plants and the
sundews,

00:17:56.108 --> 00:17:58.214
and people thought that the
pitcher plants and the sundews

00:17:58.214 --> 00:17:58.769
were related.
 

00:17:58.769 --> 00:18:02.403
These are plants that are
adapted to living under very low

00:18:02.403 --> 00:18:05.696
nitrogen conditions,
and they need nitrogen to make

00:18:05.696 --> 00:18:08.568
all of their proteins,
and they get it by killing

00:18:08.568 --> 00:18:09.980
insects and other things.
 

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.240
Some of them can even kill a
small frog.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:17.144
So it was thought that it was
likely that this was a natural

00:18:17.144 --> 00:18:20.914
group and that they had all
evolved these capacities in an

00:18:20.914 --> 00:18:23.482
ancestral condition,
and that they were all related

00:18:23.482 --> 00:18:23.940
to each other.
 

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:24.509
But they're not.
 

00:18:24.509 --> 00:18:27.970
It's happened several times.
 

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:30.828
It wasn't really clear where
the whales had come from.

00:18:30.828 --> 00:18:34.711
One might have thought that
well maybe whales are related to

00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:37.934
seals, or perhaps they're
related to other aquatic

00:18:37.934 --> 00:18:39.578
mammals, like otters.
 

00:18:39.578 --> 00:18:41.400
But seals and otters are
carnivores,

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.730
and it turns out that whales,
including the toothed whales,

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:47.549
the active carnivorous dolphins
and sperm whales,

00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:49.730
are ungulates.
 

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:50.012
Okay?
 

00:18:50.012 --> 00:18:53.472
So there was an ungulate that
used go around eating plants and

00:18:53.472 --> 00:18:56.648
it went into the water and it
started to eat all kinds of

00:18:56.648 --> 00:18:57.670
other things.
 

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:58.038
Okay?
 

00:18:58.038 --> 00:19:01.805
It stopped eating plants and it
started eating fish,

00:19:01.805 --> 00:19:05.479
squid;
and some of them eat a lot of

00:19:05.479 --> 00:19:08.799
crustacea, if they filter feed.
 

00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:10.470
Sycamores.
 

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:14.189
Sycamores, or plane trees,
are the classic tree which is

00:19:14.189 --> 00:19:16.759
used to decorate the European
plaza.

00:19:16.759 --> 00:19:17.281
Okay?
 

00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:23.137
If you like to sit out in the
summer, in Italy or France,

00:19:23.137 --> 00:19:29.202
and watch the people go by,
you're probably sitting under a

00:19:29.202 --> 00:19:31.190
sycamore tree.
 

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.219
And they have a leaf that looks
like a maple leaf,

00:19:34.219 --> 00:19:37.680
and if you just look at a
sycamore--and by the way it has

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.215
a kind of blotchy bark;
so it has sort of white bark

00:19:41.215 --> 00:19:44.464
but with blotches on it--
if you just look at a sycamore

00:19:44.464 --> 00:19:46.740
and you just look at the shape
of the leaf,

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.051
you might think,
"Oh, these are related to

00:19:48.051 --> 00:19:48.480
maples."
 

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.618
They aren't at all.
 

00:19:49.618 --> 00:19:54.308
They are in fact more closely
related to water lilies.

00:19:54.308 --> 00:19:56.960
Now those are some pretty
radical surprises.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.578
Those are things that were
buried in the DNA sequences,

00:19:59.578 --> 00:20:02.298
that were not apparent in the
morphology,

00:20:02.298 --> 00:20:05.825
and they are not only testimony
to the power of molecular

00:20:05.825 --> 00:20:08.798
systematics,
they are testimony to the power

00:20:08.798 --> 00:20:12.858
of natural selection to change
the shape of things in ways that

00:20:12.858 --> 00:20:15.871
are profoundly altering and
create all sorts of

00:20:15.871 --> 00:20:18.490
mis-impressions about
relationship.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.920
So here are some pentastomids.
 

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.195
This set of pentastomid worms
here is actually crawling across

00:20:25.195 --> 00:20:27.578
the roof of a crocodile's mouth.
 

00:20:27.578 --> 00:20:32.640
They tend to live in the noses
of crocodiles and dogs.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.165
They don't tend to live in
humans, this is one of those

00:20:36.165 --> 00:20:40.084
yucky, creepy-crawlies that you
don't have to worry about too

00:20:40.084 --> 00:20:41.259
much yourself.
 

00:20:41.259 --> 00:20:44.487
But it looks--actually it looks
something like a beetle larva,

00:20:44.487 --> 00:20:47.711
or something like that;
it looks kind of like a

00:20:47.711 --> 00:20:48.538
mealworm.
 

00:20:48.538 --> 00:20:53.815
But look, it's got segments in
it, and it has some kind of

00:20:53.815 --> 00:20:56.130
funny structure inside.
 

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.470
It turns out that it's most
closely related to this thing.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:06.618
Here is a fish louse on the
outside of a triggerfish,

00:21:06.618 --> 00:21:09.920
and this is an isopod.
 

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.028
Pentastomids are related to
fish lice.

00:21:13.028 --> 00:21:17.461
They are not related to
beetles, or to nematode worms,

00:21:17.461 --> 00:21:19.970
or to a lot of other things.
 

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:23.185
And, in fact,
they're nested within the fish

00:21:23.185 --> 00:21:23.710
lice.
 

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:28.030
So evolution took something
that looked like that and turned

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.130
it into that.
 

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:33.201
And like a lot of things,
this probably was accomplished

00:21:33.201 --> 00:21:37.048
by things like crocodiles eating
things like fish.

00:21:37.048 --> 00:21:40.279
And when the parasite that was
living on the fish got ingested

00:21:40.279 --> 00:21:42.025
by the crocodile,
it was more or less,

00:21:42.025 --> 00:21:44.362
"Oh my heavens,
how am I going to adapt to the

00:21:44.362 --> 00:21:45.259
crocodile?"
 

00:21:45.259 --> 00:21:48.700
Well if it could fall of the
fish and stay in the mouth of

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.960
the crocodile and crawl up its
nose, it can survive;

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.430
which essentially is what these
things did.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.650
Here are two carnivorous plants.
 

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:02.140
Okay? They are polyphyletic.
 

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.299
Pitcher plants have evolved
independently at least three

00:22:05.299 --> 00:22:07.672
times;
flypaper traps at least five

00:22:07.672 --> 00:22:08.150
times.
 

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:11.092
There are two groups of pitcher
plants that are sister groups to

00:22:11.092 --> 00:22:14.848
two clades of flypaper traps;
but others have other sister

00:22:14.848 --> 00:22:15.509
groups.
 

00:22:15.509 --> 00:22:18.558
So these are actually deeply
cool plants.

00:22:18.558 --> 00:22:22.548
The world hotspot of pitcher
plants,

00:22:22.548 --> 00:22:25.818
if you have a deep desire to go
collect a lot of pitcher plants,

00:22:25.818 --> 00:22:31.854
is Borneo, and it is no
coincidence that Borneo is an

00:22:31.854 --> 00:22:37.048
island that has very,
very nitrogen poor soil,

00:22:37.048 --> 00:22:42.568
and the trees and all the
shrubs that live on Borneo,

00:22:42.568 --> 00:22:46.348
many of them have special
adaptations to dealing with this

00:22:46.348 --> 00:22:48.140
low nutrient environment.
 

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:53.105
Things like flypaper and the
sundews, the flypaper traps,

00:22:53.105 --> 00:22:57.363
they often live in bogs,
which also are extremely

00:22:57.363 --> 00:22:58.960
nutrient poor.
 

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.482
If you go to Bethany Bog here,
you will find these living in

00:23:02.482 --> 00:23:03.318
Bethany Bog.
 

00:23:03.318 --> 00:23:07.295
It's a kettle lake that was
left after the glaciers

00:23:07.295 --> 00:23:08.250
retreated.
 

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.469
There's a mat of vegetation
growing out over it,

00:23:10.469 --> 00:23:13.208
which means that in the middle
of it, the plants are living

00:23:13.208 --> 00:23:14.200
right over water.
 

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:19.229
The water is nutrient poor,
and there are flypaper traps

00:23:19.229 --> 00:23:23.710
catching flies out there,
to get their protein.

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:27.756
This is a chunk of the Tree of
Life that shows you the

00:23:27.756 --> 00:23:29.970
radiation of the ungulates.
 

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:33.291
And you can see that both the
toothed and the baleen whales

00:23:33.291 --> 00:23:36.900
are nested within the ungulates,
and their closest relatives are

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:37.759
the hippos.
 

00:23:37.759 --> 00:23:41.316
So you should think that the
ancestor of the hippo went into

00:23:41.316 --> 00:23:44.940
the ocean,
probably about 35,000,000 years

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:46.865
ago,
and right here,

00:23:46.865 --> 00:23:50.442
marked on the tree,
are some of the genes which

00:23:50.442 --> 00:23:53.748
have changed along these
particular lines and which are

00:23:53.748 --> 00:23:55.829
signals of those relationships.
 

00:24:00.808 --> 00:24:05.480
So the take-home point is that
appearances are deceptive and

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.618
detective work is needed.
 

00:24:07.618 --> 00:24:09.920
Now how do you do the detective
work?

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.420
How do you build a phylogenetic
tree?

00:24:16.098 --> 00:24:18.411
Before I do that,
do you guys have any favorite

00:24:18.411 --> 00:24:21.358
sort of phylogenetic--you have;
Jeremy what's yours?

00:24:21.358 --> 00:24:22.827
Teaching Fellow:
Yes, gnetales,

00:24:22.827 --> 00:24:25.170
not being related to flowering
plants, for me personally.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.759
Because gnetales have double
fertilization,

00:24:27.759 --> 00:24:30.721
which is a very interesting
innovation of plants,

00:24:30.721 --> 00:24:32.509
or flowering plants have.
 

00:24:32.509 --> 00:24:35.531
And actually ginkgos are
gnetales in the gymnosperms,

00:24:35.531 --> 00:24:36.519
the pine trees.
 

00:24:36.519 --> 00:24:40.568
That personally--we learned
that from Burleigh and Mathews .

00:24:40.568 --> 00:24:42.150
Prof: So how recently
was that discovered?

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:43.640
Teaching Fellow:
 Like three years ago;

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.240
three or four years ago.
 

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.349
Prof: Okay,
see, the tree keeps changing.

00:24:46.349 --> 00:24:47.289
It's a moving target.
 

00:24:47.289 --> 00:24:48.848
It gets better.
 

00:24:48.848 --> 00:24:52.116
The basic branches are not
moving too much,

00:24:52.116 --> 00:24:56.630
but out there on the tips
there's still a lot of action.

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:57.519
So how do you get it?
 

00:24:57.519 --> 00:24:58.839
How do you build a phylogenetic
tree?

00:24:58.839 --> 00:25:04.710
Well this is an important point.
 

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:05.789
You need to have some
characters;

00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:07.348
so those are states of traits.
 

00:25:07.348 --> 00:25:09.838
They could be nucleotide
sequences.

00:25:09.838 --> 00:25:13.159
It could be whether the thing
has scales or fur,

00:25:13.159 --> 00:25:17.680
or it could be whether it has a
three or four-chambered heart.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.759
It could be a lot of things.
 

00:25:19.759 --> 00:25:23.607
So you need characters,
and they need to have different

00:25:23.607 --> 00:25:24.250
states.
 

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:29.257
And the characters that are
informative are shared derived

00:25:29.257 --> 00:25:30.400
characters.
 

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.209
I will go into this issue with
a full slide,

00:25:33.209 --> 00:25:37.077
because this is a key point;
the characters that give you

00:25:37.077 --> 00:25:41.369
phylogenetic information are the
ones that everything in a group

00:25:41.369 --> 00:25:44.828
shares with each other,
and it's different from the

00:25:44.828 --> 00:25:45.430
ancestor.
 

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:55.582
Well, you can only define
derived by comparison with

00:25:55.582 --> 00:25:56.630
primitive.
 

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.942
Okay?
 

00:25:56.942 --> 00:26:00.635
So primitive is like what it
used to be, and derived is what

00:26:00.635 --> 00:26:04.017
it is now, somewhere on the
tree, and you can't do that

00:26:04.017 --> 00:26:05.269
without a tree.
 

00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:07.308
So there's kind of a paradox.
 

00:26:07.308 --> 00:26:10.690
You don't have a tree,
and if you don't have it,

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:13.759
you don't have a way to
determine what came first,

00:26:13.759 --> 00:26:16.970
and therefore you don't know
about character polarization.

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:21.892
Character polarization means
knowing which state is primitive

00:26:21.892 --> 00:26:26.915
and which is derived;
that polarizes that series of

00:26:26.915 --> 00:26:28.430
trait states.
 

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.140
So there are number of ways out
of this logical dilemma.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:35.608
One is you look at all possible
trees--

00:26:35.608 --> 00:26:38.318
this is, by the way,
a huge computational problem,

00:26:38.318 --> 00:26:40.473
as you'll see at the end--and
you choose the ones that are

00:26:40.473 --> 00:26:40.890
simplest.
 

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:43.940
So that's the principle of
parsimony.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.647
And it's a logical principle;
it's not an empirical

00:26:46.647 --> 00:26:49.039
principle, and it's not
necessarily the way that

00:26:49.039 --> 00:26:50.160
evolution operates.
 

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:55.338
But given that there are many,
many possible trees,

00:26:55.338 --> 00:26:59.170
choosing the simplest one
basically is a way of saying,

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:03.440
"This is how we're dealing
with our ignorance."

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.965
Or you could choose the tree
that would make it most likely

00:27:06.965 --> 00:27:10.856
that you would have observed the
character data that you actually

00:27:10.856 --> 00:27:14.211
did observe;
that's called the principle of

00:27:14.211 --> 00:27:15.798
maximum likelihood.
 

00:27:15.798 --> 00:27:19.516
And, in fact,
in the computer programs and in

00:27:19.516 --> 00:27:24.328
the theoretical arguments that
go on in phylogenetics,

00:27:24.328 --> 00:27:28.482
these are two of the main
themes, and many of the methods

00:27:28.482 --> 00:27:33.210
combine them,
in various ways.

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:37.930
Okay, so a bit about
shared-derived characters.

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:40.686
Remember that picture with the
different colors,

00:27:40.686 --> 00:27:43.210
with the different parts of the
forelimb?

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:44.759
Having a forelimb that has a
humerus,

00:27:44.759 --> 00:27:47.400
a radius, an ulna,
carpals and metacarpals,

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.656
in that sequence,
really doesn't help us to

00:27:50.656 --> 00:27:53.140
distinguish bats from turtles.
 

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.940
Okay?
 

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:59.140
That trait's shared among all
tetrapods.

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.839
So the fact that you're looking
at a thing, that's got those

00:28:02.839 --> 00:28:06.665
parts to it, doesn't help you to
distinguish bats from turtles

00:28:06.665 --> 00:28:08.358
from whales from seals.
 

00:28:08.358 --> 00:28:10.599
Sure, they've all got it,
but that's not telling you

00:28:10.599 --> 00:28:13.058
whether they're closely related
to each other or not,

00:28:13.058 --> 00:28:16.329
because they all got it from a
common ancestor;

00:28:16.329 --> 00:28:18.588
it's not derived.
 

00:28:18.588 --> 00:28:23.153
However, that structure
distinguishes the tetrapods from

00:28:23.153 --> 00:28:25.230
the lobe-finned fishes.
 

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:29.042
So at that point on the tree it
becomes useful as a

00:28:29.042 --> 00:28:31.788
shared-derived marker,
of a group;

00:28:31.788 --> 00:28:34.000
which is why,
one of the reasons why,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.710
we're pretty confident that the
tetrapods is a good group,

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:41.442
and that things didn't- that
the vertebrates didn't come out

00:28:41.442 --> 00:28:43.848
of the water multiple times.
 

00:28:43.848 --> 00:28:47.147
In this context it's marking a
trait that originated once in

00:28:47.147 --> 00:28:49.828
their common ancestor;
it's shared by all of them;

00:28:49.828 --> 00:28:52.588
it's not found in their closest
relatives.

00:28:52.588 --> 00:28:54.808
The jargon is derived from the
Greek.

00:28:54.808 --> 00:28:57.640
This thing is called a
synapomorphy.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:01.599
Syn means shared;
apo means derived;

00:29:01.599 --> 00:29:03.118
and morph means trait.
 

00:29:03.118 --> 00:29:08.098
So a shared-derived trait is a
synapomorphy.

00:29:08.098 --> 00:29:12.519
Now there's a bunch of
important stuff here.

00:29:12.519 --> 00:29:19.670
Just looking the same isn't
very helpful.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:22.301
The informative traits are the
ones that are shared and

00:29:22.301 --> 00:29:22.788
derived.
 

00:29:22.788 --> 00:29:25.923
And what is shared and what is
derived, and therefore what is

00:29:25.923 --> 00:29:27.910
informative, depends on the
context;

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:29.809
it depends on the part of the
tree that you're sitting in.

00:29:33.058 --> 00:29:37.009
Okay, now a little bit about
building trees.

00:29:37.009 --> 00:29:41.077
You can think--evolution is
real complex and a lot of stuff

00:29:41.077 --> 00:29:42.058
is going on.
 

00:29:42.058 --> 00:29:47.065
But let's suppose that A has
the ancestral state of a trait,

00:29:47.065 --> 00:29:51.730
and that between A and B and C,
a new state of the trait

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:52.750
evolves.
 

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:57.460
So Ancestral is blue and New is
red.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:01.440
And this marks the point where
that trait started to change,

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:05.555
and then it spread through the
population and by this point it

00:30:05.555 --> 00:30:06.500
was fixed.
 

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:10.718
Well this is a cartoon,
and this is a cartoon of a

00:30:10.718 --> 00:30:11.578
cartoon.
 

00:30:11.578 --> 00:30:11.926
Okay?
 

00:30:11.926 --> 00:30:16.165
We're just marking where that
happened, and the only important

00:30:16.165 --> 00:30:20.474
thing about this mark is that it
is between this point and this

00:30:20.474 --> 00:30:22.165
point;
other than that,

00:30:22.165 --> 00:30:24.599
we don't really know exactly
where it is.

00:30:24.599 --> 00:30:26.710
Okay?
 

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:32.009
Now A, B and C would normally
be species.

00:30:32.009 --> 00:30:32.247
Okay?
 

00:30:32.247 --> 00:30:33.769
But they could be other things.
 

00:30:33.769 --> 00:30:36.597
They could be genes,
or they could be genera or

00:30:36.597 --> 00:30:38.690
families or something like that.
 

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:41.380
And 1,2, and 3 are characters.
 

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:45.250
They could be morphological;
they could be molecular.

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:49.205
And, as a convention,
the ancestral state of that

00:30:49.205 --> 00:30:53.904
character will be denoted 0,
and the derived state will be

00:30:53.904 --> 00:30:57.333
denoted 1;
and the arrow indicates going

00:30:57.333 --> 00:30:59.450
from ancestral to derived.
 

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:03.545
And basically what this picture
is telling you is that Trait 1

00:31:03.545 --> 00:31:06.028
changed from ancestral to
derived,

00:31:06.028 --> 00:31:09.626
between A and B,
and then after B split off from

00:31:09.626 --> 00:31:13.630
C,
two more things changed in C.

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:17.944
Okay, so that's the information
that picture is trying to give

00:31:17.944 --> 00:31:18.368
you.
 

00:31:18.368 --> 00:31:23.130
And if you put down a real
interesting vertebrate

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:26.787
phylogeny,
like this, a vertebrate

00:31:26.787 --> 00:31:31.420
phylogeny which has some
unfortunate names,

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:36.144
for certain groups on it--okay?;
like reptiles aren't real--and

00:31:36.144 --> 00:31:39.243
we use these characters,
having a vertebral column,

00:31:39.243 --> 00:31:41.414
having lungs,
having an amniotic egg,

00:31:41.414 --> 00:31:43.832
having lactation,
eggshell absent,

00:31:43.832 --> 00:31:48.051
chorioallantoic placenta,
hooves on distal phalanges,

00:31:48.051 --> 00:31:50.597
a petrosal bulla,
in the skull,

00:31:50.597 --> 00:31:54.623
then what we can see from
plotting those along the line

00:31:54.623 --> 00:31:58.944
basically is which characters
here are distinguishing which

00:31:58.944 --> 00:32:01.694
groups;
what's going on when you go out

00:32:01.694 --> 00:32:04.390
into the ungulates,
the horses and the cows.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:10.076
The vertebral column is a
synapomorphy of the vertebrates,

00:32:10.076 --> 00:32:12.769
of this whole bunch here.
 

00:32:12.769 --> 00:32:17.103
But if we just look at the
mammals, which are from here on

00:32:17.103 --> 00:32:21.143
out, it's an ancestral trait;
it's not a derived trait,

00:32:21.143 --> 00:32:25.117
it's a shared-primitive trait,
and that's a symplesiomorphy,

00:32:25.117 --> 00:32:26.598
not a synapomorphy.
 

00:32:26.598 --> 00:32:31.117
The lungs, which come in right
here, at 2, are a synapomorphy

00:32:31.117 --> 00:32:34.280
of the tetrapods,
but they are an ancestral

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.670
trait, a symplesiomorphy of the
amniotes;

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:42.596
okay, so the amniotes are back
here--excuse me,

00:32:42.596 --> 00:32:45.490
the amniotes are up here.
 

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:48.343
So whether you call a trait one
or the other depends on where it

00:32:48.343 --> 00:32:50.880
sits in the tree and what it
allows you to do with it.

00:32:54.818 --> 00:32:59.354
This is a bit of the
relationship between trees and

00:32:59.354 --> 00:33:00.078
names.
 

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:03.894
Ideally we would like that
relationship to be totally clear

00:33:03.894 --> 00:33:07.380
and unambiguous so that if I
just give you a name,

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.329
you know where that thing sits
in the tree.

00:33:10.329 --> 00:33:12.558
This is a hard thing to do.
 

00:33:12.558 --> 00:33:16.978
It is so hard to do that there
is now a complete overturning of

00:33:16.978 --> 00:33:20.470
the Linnaean System of
Classification going on.

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:23.758
It's being led by a couple of
guys here, Michael Donoghue and

00:33:23.758 --> 00:33:24.798
Jacques Gauthier.
 

00:33:24.798 --> 00:33:28.017
Michael is in our department,
and he's also vice-president of

00:33:28.017 --> 00:33:30.430
the university,
and Jacques Gauthier is a prof

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.200
in G&amp;G - in Paleontology.
 

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:36.551
And they have worked a lot on
how to get a way to name things

00:33:36.551 --> 00:33:40.977
that actually tells you their
complete position on the Tree of

00:33:40.977 --> 00:33:41.630
Life.
 

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.885
Okay?
 

00:33:41.885 --> 00:33:43.838
It's going to be a big computer
code.

00:33:43.838 --> 00:33:47.650
It's not going to be something
nice like Homo sapiens.

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:48.085
Okay?
 

00:33:48.085 --> 00:33:51.130
Homo sapiens is the Linnaean
name.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:54.630
The new method will contain a
lot more information in it,

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:57.973
and will probably only be
something that you can store on

00:33:57.973 --> 00:34:00.304
your iPhone,
or whatever else it is that you

00:34:00.304 --> 00:34:01.599
use to replace your memory.
 

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:10.969
But ideally these terms would
map onto natural relationships;

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:13.449
and these terms actually do map
onto these natural

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:14.260
relationships.
 

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:14.572
Okay?
 

00:34:14.572 --> 00:34:17.831
So this is the primates,
and these are the ungulates,

00:34:17.831 --> 00:34:21.090
and they are nested within the
eutherian mammals.

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:24.449
The therian mammals include the
marsupials, and the mammals

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:27.577
include the monotremes,
which are the spiny echidna and

00:34:27.577 --> 00:34:29.199
the duckbilled platypus.
 

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:32.523
And between them and the
marsupials is where the female

00:34:32.523 --> 00:34:35.784
reproductive tract evolved,
because the monotremes are

00:34:35.784 --> 00:34:37.139
still laying eggs.
 

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:42.150
And then the amniotes would
include the so-called reptiles;

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:45.342
that would actually be
crocodiles, lizards,

00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:46.710
snakes, turtles.
 

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:49.561
The tetrapods include the
amphibians, and then the

00:34:49.561 --> 00:34:51.889
vertebrates include the fish,
as well.

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:55.559
So this is a natural
classification,

00:34:55.559 --> 00:35:01.224
and that's the way all
taxonomic nomenclature should be

00:35:01.224 --> 00:35:05.000
related to all good systematics.
 

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.670
Now, how do you actually infer
a tree from a character matrix?

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:12.626
So here we're just trying to
figure out if things are related

00:35:12.626 --> 00:35:13.070
or not.
 

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:14.340
We don't have a tree yet.
 

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.518
Okay?
 

00:35:15.518 --> 00:35:21.349
And we have three species and
we have three characters;

00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:27.012
and in this case ancestral is
going to be 0 and 1 is going to

00:35:27.012 --> 00:35:28.239
be derived.
 

00:35:28.239 --> 00:35:32.327
Well this particular character
matrix is consistent with

00:35:32.327 --> 00:35:35.969
drawing a tree this way,
and then marking down the

00:35:35.969 --> 00:35:37.530
transitions here.
 

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:43.262
So when 1 went from ancestral
to derived, it changed here in

00:35:43.262 --> 00:35:47.052
both B and C,
and when 2 and 3 went from

00:35:47.052 --> 00:35:51.619
ancestral to derived,
it changed only in C.

00:35:51.619 --> 00:35:56.659
So can you see how the tree
relates to the matrix?

00:35:56.659 --> 00:35:58.139
Okay?
 

00:35:58.139 --> 00:36:00.809
Any question about that at this
point?

00:36:00.809 --> 00:36:02.429
I've made the simplest one I
could.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:13.248
Now if we did it with overall
similarity, A and B share five

00:36:13.248 --> 00:36:15.750
ancestral counts.
 

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:16.719
Okay?
 

00:36:16.719 --> 00:36:21.568
In three traits,
1,2 and 3, A has got the

00:36:21.568 --> 00:36:23.750
ancestral state.
 

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:25.802
In two traits,
two of those,

00:36:25.802 --> 00:36:29.677
in B--B has also got the
ancestral trait in 2 and 3,

00:36:29.677 --> 00:36:32.489
and that would suggest this
tree.

00:36:32.489 --> 00:36:37.449
But if we go by derived
similarity, then we get this

00:36:37.449 --> 00:36:38.130
tree.
 

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:40.150
And you can see what it does to
the tree.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:43.329
So this is overall similarity,
which is misleading,

00:36:43.329 --> 00:36:47.329
and this is shared derived
trait phylogenetics,

00:36:47.329 --> 00:36:51.820
which yields this tree,
and it shifts the sister of B

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.030
from A to C.
 

00:36:56.159 --> 00:36:59.519
Now if life were only so simple.
 

00:36:59.519 --> 00:37:01.079
Life is never simple.
 

00:37:01.079 --> 00:37:05.409
Traits can conflict with each
other in the information they

00:37:05.409 --> 00:37:07.650
give you, and they often do.
 

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:10.864
So here is a character matrix
with no conflict,

00:37:10.864 --> 00:37:14.079
and here's a character matrix
with conflict.

00:37:14.079 --> 00:37:14.900
Okay?
 

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:17.663
So everything was looking
pretty good, as long as we'd

00:37:17.663 --> 00:37:19.750
only measured Trait 1 and 2 down
here.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:24.887
But then we measured Trait 3,
and Trait 3 seemed to indicate

00:37:24.887 --> 00:37:28.719
that C had this ancestral trait
over here.

00:37:28.719 --> 00:37:32.905
It was beginning to look like C
was going to be a highly derived

00:37:32.905 --> 00:37:33.570
species.
 

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:36.253
But then we've looked at
another trait and it wasn't like

00:37:36.253 --> 00:37:36.590
that.
 

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:37.760
What do you do?
 

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.320
Right?
 

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.179
What do you do?
 

00:37:39.179 --> 00:37:42.980
Well you can choose the
simplest tree.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:45.659
You can choose the one that
implies the least change.

00:37:45.659 --> 00:37:51.715
So here are all trees which are
consistent with this character

00:37:51.715 --> 00:37:52.610
matrix.
 

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:59.112
And if you go back and try,
I think you will see that you

00:37:59.112 --> 00:38:03.989
can plot all of these changes
onto here.

00:38:03.989 --> 00:38:08.215
So basically this tree is
saying that third trait down

00:38:08.215 --> 00:38:12.023
here, it changed twice;
it changed once in A and it

00:38:12.023 --> 00:38:13.300
changed once in B.
 

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:17.163
So it went from an ancestral
state up to a derived state,

00:38:17.163 --> 00:38:18.750
along these branches.
 

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:22.106
And these traits up here,
1 and 2, they changed between

00:38:22.106 --> 00:38:24.840
A, on the one hand,
and B and C on the other,

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.400
here.
 

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:28.480
So you could do that also,
and you would find that all of

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.449
these trees are actually
consistent with that character

00:38:31.449 --> 00:38:35.161
matrix,
but this one takes five changes

00:38:35.161 --> 00:38:38.409
and these only take 4:
1,2, 3,4;

00:38:38.409 --> 00:38:40.840
1,2, 3,4, 5.
 

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:45.404
Therefore, we come to the
conclusion that one of these

00:38:45.404 --> 00:38:49.451
traits, one of these trees,
is probably correct,

00:38:49.451 --> 00:38:52.809
just by the principle of
parsimony.

00:38:52.809 --> 00:38:56.445
And the only way that we really
resolve this kind of issue is by

00:38:56.445 --> 00:38:57.599
getting more data.
 

00:38:57.599 --> 00:39:00.532
The more data you get,
the more likely it is that that

00:39:00.532 --> 00:39:02.360
will converge on the real tree.
 

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:05.641
I would like to point out that
there probably is not enough

00:39:05.641 --> 00:39:09.036
data in the world to do that,
for all of the creatures on the

00:39:09.036 --> 00:39:09.659
planet.
 

00:39:09.659 --> 00:39:11.237
In other words,
at the end of the process there

00:39:11.237 --> 00:39:12.539
will still be some unresolved
stuff.

00:39:15.989 --> 00:39:19.590
Now what about--let me just put
that in--what about this?

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.389
Where does the root come from?
 

00:39:21.389 --> 00:39:24.889
Well these are unrooted trees,
up here,

00:39:24.889 --> 00:39:29.597
and the choice of where you
decide the ancestral state is

00:39:29.597 --> 00:39:34.219
actually makes quite a bit of
difference to the tree.

00:39:34.219 --> 00:39:37.047
I'm sorry that in translating
this has gotten screwed up a

00:39:37.047 --> 00:39:37.940
little bit here.
 

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.742
This is actually A over here,
and then it goes D,

00:39:41.742 --> 00:39:43.090
B, C over here.
 

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:46.309
Choosing this as the root,
rather than this,

00:39:46.309 --> 00:39:50.130
changes the relationship from B
and D to B and C;

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:54.550
this is B and this is C;
this is B and this is D.

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:57.907
So where do you get the
outgroup, how do you decide

00:39:57.907 --> 00:39:59.719
where the root should be?
 

00:39:59.719 --> 00:40:08.878
Well, that issue can only be
decided in the context of a

00:40:08.878 --> 00:40:11.210
bigger tree.
 

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:14.777
So you must have some other
kind of information to suggest

00:40:14.777 --> 00:40:16.719
what your out group might be.
 

00:40:16.719 --> 00:40:19.373
And, when this is actually
done, sometimes people see

00:40:19.373 --> 00:40:22.231
whether the choice of an
outgroup is actually going to be

00:40:22.231 --> 00:40:24.630
changing the shape of their tree
very much.

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:26.706
They will report,
"We tried this and this

00:40:26.706 --> 00:40:29.153
and this as the out group,
and these were the results,

00:40:29.153 --> 00:40:30.170
to our tree."
 

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:33.409
Okay?
 

00:40:33.409 --> 00:40:36.829
Now, you get your trait matrix,
you want to find the simplest

00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:37.230
tree.
 

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:41.018
One of them is to do an
exhaustive search.

00:40:41.018 --> 00:40:45.760
So here are two terminal taxa,
B and C.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:46.670
Okay?
 

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.409
We've chosen A as the ancestral
condition;

00:40:49.409 --> 00:40:51.550
it's not an existing species
now.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:54.170
A, we say, is going to be the
out group;

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:56.579
that's going to be link to the
ancestors.

00:40:56.579 --> 00:40:58.909
Only one tree possible.
 

00:40:58.909 --> 00:41:05.565
If we have three terminal taxa,
we can have either B as the

00:41:05.565 --> 00:41:10.199
closest relative of D;
C as the closest relative of D;

00:41:10.199 --> 00:41:12.469
or B and C as being their
closest relative.

00:41:12.469 --> 00:41:14.829
So there are three
possibilities there.

00:41:14.829 --> 00:41:17.766
If we have four terminal taxa,
oh my goodness,

00:41:17.766 --> 00:41:19.659
suddenly we have this many.
 

00:41:19.659 --> 00:41:21.449
Oh that's confusing.
 

00:41:21.449 --> 00:41:27.445
If we have 500 terminal taxa,
we have 1 times 10^(1280

00:41:27.445 --> 00:41:29.369
)possibilities.
 

00:41:29.369 --> 00:41:33.030
This is a combinatorial
explosion of possibilities.

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:38.639
And about, oh say about
2003,2004,

00:41:38.639 --> 00:41:44.847
it took nine months of runtime
on a supercomputer to sort out

00:41:44.847 --> 00:41:51.262
all of the possible trees for a
reasonable number of characters

00:41:51.262 --> 00:41:54.159
for something like this.
 

00:41:54.159 --> 00:41:57.050
So if you have 500 species and
you wanted--

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:59.570
and you had a reasonable number
of characters,

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:03.469
you would only get a tiny
fraction of those trees covered,

00:42:03.469 --> 00:42:05.860
and you would wait nine months
to get your answer.

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.422
It's gotten a little better
than that recently,

00:42:08.422 --> 00:42:09.260
but not much.
 

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:09.849
Okay?
 

00:42:09.849 --> 00:42:11.510
So there are ways to get around
this problem.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.824
There are all kinds of
heuristic ways to get around

00:42:13.824 --> 00:42:14.150
this.
 

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:17.358
There are ways of jumping into
tree space and doing local

00:42:17.358 --> 00:42:20.340
approximations and then
branching things together.

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:23.077
So that, for example,
when the New York Times

00:42:23.077 --> 00:42:25.887
reported last week,
on Darwin's birthday,

00:42:25.887 --> 00:42:30.382
that biologists had recently
been able to publish a tree of

00:42:30.382 --> 00:42:33.367
11,000 plant species,
which was done here,

00:42:33.367 --> 00:42:35.829
by Stephen Smith and Michael
Donoghue's group;

00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:39.375
he did that as a super-tree,
using these approximation

00:42:39.375 --> 00:42:42.920
techniques to patch together
lots of smaller trees.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:46.438
And there are all kinds of
criteria that get applied to how

00:42:46.438 --> 00:42:47.349
good that is.
 

00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:49.760
By the way, one of the things
that Stephen turned up is that

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.559
hey, the ferns are still
evolving rapidly;

00:42:51.559 --> 00:42:52.599
which is kind of neat.
 

00:42:52.599 --> 00:42:53.590
Lots of other stuff is in that.
 

00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:00.309
So, the Tree of Life is not
given.

00:43:00.309 --> 00:43:03.239
We have to discover it.
 

00:43:03.239 --> 00:43:06.217
The informative characters in
the Tree of Life are those that

00:43:06.217 --> 00:43:07.460
are shared and derived.
 

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:09.429
So appearances deceive.
 

00:43:09.429 --> 00:43:13.639
Simply looking similar is
insufficient information.

00:43:13.639 --> 00:43:16.820
You can make a lot of trees
with the same character matrix.

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.420
You would prefer either the
simplest,

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:22.150
which implies the least change,
or the tree that maximizes the

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:25.210
probability of observing what
you actually see,

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:27.230
or some combination of those
criteria.

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:28.409
Okay?
 

00:43:28.409 --> 00:43:31.876
Next time we'll take these
methods and see how we can infer

00:43:31.876 --> 00:43:32.952
history with them.

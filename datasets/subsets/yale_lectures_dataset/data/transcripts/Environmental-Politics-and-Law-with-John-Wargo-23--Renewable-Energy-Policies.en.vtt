00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.955
Today, I want to continue
talking about energy futures and

00:00:04.955 --> 00:00:07.660
alternative choices that we have
to face.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.212
And I think about this as a
problem of being on the horns of

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:13.370
a quad-lemma.
 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.450
And after I put this slide
together,

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.850
I was on my way to lecture this
morning,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.320
I was saying to myself it's not
really a quad-lemma,

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.630
the analogy being a dilemma.
 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.810
It really has many more
dimensions to it.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.595
But the way that it's being
characterized to the public by

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:32.581
politicians and those that are
concerned about energy futures

00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:36.300
is predominately a choice
between renewables and existing

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.020
production capacity with respect
to fossil fuels,

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.720
particularly coal,
and also our nuclear future

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.520
that we discussed last week.
 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.400
But the topic that really does
not make it onto the agenda,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.960
which is one that I think is
crucial,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.781
is energy efficiency and what
we could achieve by altering our

00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:56.410
patterns of consumption.
 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.895
And I think as well,
our capacity to read the energy

00:00:59.895 --> 00:01:03.722
demands of our own daily
behaviors in the marketplace and

00:01:03.722 --> 00:01:07.959
in our daily lives make it
extremely difficult to do that.

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:10.890
So that today,
I want to concentrate

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.159
predominately on the problem of
renewables, but also

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.510
specifically talk about wind
energy.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.498
So the National Academy of
Sciences prepared a publication

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:24.152
that you read,
hopefully, up on the Classes

00:01:24.152 --> 00:01:27.470
server for this week,
on the potential of renewables,

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.220
particularly wind and solar.
 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.066
And solar and wind,
they concluded,

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:33.834
renewable resources offer
significantly larger total

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:37.310
energy potential than do other
domestic renewable resources.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.390
Solar intensity obviously
varies across the nation.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.277
The land-based solar resource
exceeds by several thousand-fold

00:01:45.277 --> 00:01:46.959
present annual U.S.
 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:48.459
electrical energy demand.
 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:51.254
So wind is capable is providing
at least ten percent to twenty

00:01:51.254 --> 00:01:53.616
percent,
and in some regions of the

00:01:53.616 --> 00:01:56.183
country,
potentially higher percentages

00:01:56.183 --> 00:01:58.470
of current electrical energy
demand.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.879
Think about installed capacity.
 

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:05.222
In the world,
Germany is clearly the leader

00:02:05.222 --> 00:02:09.485
in terms of megawatt production,
but also percentage of their

00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:12.439
total electrical energy demands
at about twenty-three,

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.669
twenty-four percent.
 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:14.740
The U.S.
 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.476
follows in second at about
eighteen percent,

00:02:16.476 --> 00:02:17.930
then Spain, India,
China, Denmark.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.153
But this ranking is shifting
quite rapidly,

00:02:21.153 --> 00:02:25.683
particularly in China and India
and other rapidly developing

00:02:25.683 --> 00:02:27.449
parts of the world.
 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:32.402
Well, there was a statute that
was passed back in 2005 that has

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:35.440
really provided a lot of
incentive,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.611
economic incentive to the
private sector and to government

00:02:39.611 --> 00:02:44.370
agencies as well to think about
new forms of providing energy,

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.180
particularly from renewable
resources.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.280
So income from activity may be
excluded from gross income and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.378
not taxed if it's expended on
renewable energy facilities.

00:02:54.378 --> 00:02:58.080
Income may be taxed at a lower
rate.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.968
The expense from the activity
may be deducted more quickly.

00:03:01.968 --> 00:03:06.075
And those of you that filed
your income taxes last week

00:03:06.075 --> 00:03:09.270
probably do not itemize your
deductions.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.777
But deductions are set up in
ways that you may depreciate

00:03:12.777 --> 00:03:15.408
property over different lengths
of time.

00:03:15.408 --> 00:03:20.199
You may be able to depreciate a
car,

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.171
for example,
over eight or ten years or a

00:03:22.171 --> 00:03:25.507
truck over that period of time,
a house is thirty-two years,

00:03:25.507 --> 00:03:28.348
and other kinds of products
that you might buy.

00:03:28.348 --> 00:03:31.181
You could depreciate those
fully in the first year,

00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:34.240
meaning that you can get a
total deduction on its value

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.620
during the year that you
purchased it.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.020
So that these expenses may be
eligible for tax credits as

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.568
well.
 

00:03:41.568 --> 00:03:43.628
A deduction is different than a
tax credit.

00:03:43.628 --> 00:03:49.217
A deduction is an itemization
that you would use to reduce

00:03:49.217 --> 00:03:54.020
your total estimated or adjusted
gross income,

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.156
whereas a tax credit would be a
reduction in your taxes at the

00:03:58.156 --> 00:03:59.580
end of your return.
 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.305
Most people would favor taking
a tax credit,

00:04:01.305 --> 00:04:02.830
it would be more to their
advantage.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.566
So that these production tax
credits that came into being in

00:04:06.566 --> 00:04:10.430
2005 really have been quite
successful, as is demonstrated.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:17.105
There were previous production
credits back in 1999 and 2001

00:04:17.105 --> 00:04:18.350
and 2003.
 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.740
And then they expired at the
end of those years.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.605
So that if you can see this
chart, you can see the rather

00:04:25.605 --> 00:04:30.295
dramatic decline in the
populations taking advantage of

00:04:30.295 --> 00:04:31.860
these credits.
 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.454
There is a business solar tax
credit that offers a thirty

00:04:34.454 --> 00:04:36.863
percent tax credit for the
purchase of equipment that

00:04:36.863 --> 00:04:38.300
produces solar electricity.
 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.593
Business fuel cell credits are
available that are produced even

00:04:44.593 --> 00:04:49.769
using chemicals that are created
by fossil fuels.

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:54.259
There's a residential efficient
property credit,

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:57.600
which is a personal tax credit
for eligible technology,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.088
such as water heaters,
furnaces, boilers,

00:05:01.088 --> 00:05:03.528
heat pumps, central air
conditioners,

00:05:03.528 --> 00:05:05.529
building insulation,
windows, doors,

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:06.449
and roofs.
 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.329
In my income taxes this year,
I installed a new energy

00:05:10.329 --> 00:05:14.795
efficient water heater that I
was able to take a tax credit of

00:05:14.795 --> 00:05:20.720
thirty percent of $2000,
which is a substantial savings.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.569
Also, many states are acting on
their own.

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:27.254
And a topic that we've
discussed repeatedly in the

00:05:27.254 --> 00:05:30.759
course is if you're thinking
about trying to change behavior,

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.785
what level of government is the
appropriate government to

00:05:33.785 --> 00:05:35.190
establish law or policy?
 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.221
And the federal government has
been clearly behind the eight

00:05:40.221 --> 00:05:40.819
ball.
 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:45.298
They've been delinquent or
neglectful of passing renewable

00:05:45.298 --> 00:05:50.012
energy standards and creating
incentives in a way that really

00:05:50.012 --> 00:05:54.096
had a strong influence on
renewable energy production

00:05:54.096 --> 00:05:58.339
relative to particularly fossil
fuel production.

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:02.278
So states have jumped into this
problem by creating their own

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:04.838
renewable energy portfolio
standards.

00:06:04.838 --> 00:06:07.995
So for example,
Massachusetts has a standard

00:06:07.995 --> 00:06:12.180
that is targeting fifteen
percent renewable of their total

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.088
energy demand by 2020.
 

00:06:14.088 --> 00:06:18.281
Ohio is twenty-five percent by
2025, New Mexico is twenty

00:06:18.281 --> 00:06:19.629
percent by 2020.
 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:24.673
California is 20 percent by
2010, and Washington is fifteen

00:06:24.673 --> 00:06:26.240
percent by 2020.
 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.096
So that these are legally
binding standards and the states

00:06:30.096 --> 00:06:33.952
are required to figure out how
to reduce their reliance on

00:06:33.952 --> 00:06:37.742
fossil fuels while increasing
their reliance on renewable

00:06:37.742 --> 00:06:38.690
sources.
 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.509
So if you look at the problem
of wind and you think about its

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:45.894
distribution in the nation,
Texas, perhaps not

00:06:45.894 --> 00:06:48.845
surprisingly,
has the largest current

00:06:48.845 --> 00:06:53.384
installed capacity,
almost 9,000 megawatts,

00:06:53.384 --> 00:06:56.781
followed by Iowa,
California, Minnesota,

00:06:56.781 --> 00:06:58.999
Oregon, Washington,
New York, Colorado,

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:00.519
Illinois, and then Kansas.
 

00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:07.932
You can also see the effect in
this graph of the recession on

00:07:07.932 --> 00:07:13.370
installation of wind-provided
electricity.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.923
So 2008 was far higher in new
installations than 2009,

00:07:18.923 --> 00:07:24.896
so that this industry also is
subject to the same kinds of

00:07:24.896 --> 00:07:28.670
limitations as any other sector.
 

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.300
The cost of wind and
transmission that is

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.985
economically available might be
broken into two different

00:07:34.985 --> 00:07:37.420
categories, onshore and
offshore.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.656
It's quite obviously more
expensive to develop further

00:07:40.656 --> 00:07:41.329
offshore.
 

00:07:41.329 --> 00:07:46.466
And the less expensive areas
are those that are closest to

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:47.910
the coastline.
 

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.211
And what we see,
we'll see a case in a few

00:07:51.211 --> 00:07:56.204
moments known as Cape Wind that
is being proposed for Nantucket

00:07:56.204 --> 00:07:57.009
Sound.
 

00:07:57.009 --> 00:08:01.130
And the advantage obviously is
that this is in federal

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:06.028
territory so that no private
property needs to be purchased,

00:08:06.028 --> 00:08:12.266
so that the quantity available
offshore is believed to be just

00:08:12.266 --> 00:08:15.129
about the same as onshore.
 

00:08:15.129 --> 00:08:19.233
But the difficulty of getting a
wind project off the ground on

00:08:19.233 --> 00:08:23.156
private property,
as we'll see in a few moments,

00:08:23.156 --> 00:08:27.449
compared to offshore is really
quite significant.

00:08:27.449 --> 00:08:34.558
So many people are now arguing
for a twenty percent target by

00:08:34.558 --> 00:08:39.178
2030 as a goal for wind-based
energy.

00:08:39.178 --> 00:08:42.490
If we choose this as a target,
how do we get there?

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.804
And what would be the influence
on our use of alternative

00:08:45.804 --> 00:08:46.990
sources of energy?
 

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.606
So if we have no new wind,
you can see in this chart then

00:08:50.606 --> 00:08:53.359
our reliance on natural gas,
coal, nuclear,

00:08:53.359 --> 00:08:56.409
hydro, and current wind would
look something like this,

00:08:56.409 --> 00:08:57.658
with wind in the green.
 

00:08:57.658 --> 00:09:01.010
But a twenty percent wind
scenario would predominately

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.730
cause us to reduce our reliance
on coal,

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:08.309
but also some of our reliance
on natural gas and nuclear.

00:09:08.309 --> 00:09:09.600
And why nuclear?
 

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.360
Well, because many of the
reactors are going to be

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.009
approaching the end of their
license periods.

00:09:15.009 --> 00:09:17.989
And many of them,
as we discussed last week,

00:09:17.989 --> 00:09:21.940
are beyond their thirty to
forty-year licensing period.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.528
So we're going to be phasing
out nuclear,

00:09:24.528 --> 00:09:27.830
and depending upon the
incentives for investment in new

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.609
nuclear plants,
the future growth is going to

00:09:31.609 --> 00:09:35.138
be impeded,
not just by the extraordinary

00:09:35.138 --> 00:09:39.072
capital costs and the
incremental cost of securing

00:09:39.072 --> 00:09:42.080
loans for nuclear,
given its uncertainty.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.158
But also, the problems of
simply the amount of time it

00:09:47.158 --> 00:09:50.320
takes to build a nuclear plant.
 

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.832
If we rely more heavily on
wind, we need to think about how

00:09:54.832 --> 00:09:58.945
to get transmission facilities,
transmission lines,

00:09:58.945 --> 00:10:02.570
in close proximity to the key
sources of wind.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.426
So that obviously,
as you look at the United

00:10:05.426 --> 00:10:09.080
States, you find wind capacity
varies geographically.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.067
The coastal areas,
Washington, Oregon,

00:10:12.067 --> 00:10:16.264
California, the East Coast and
the Gulf Coast are the

00:10:16.264 --> 00:10:20.058
predominant sites for offshore
development.

00:10:20.058 --> 00:10:24.227
And the Midwestern United
States is the predominant

00:10:24.227 --> 00:10:28.230
location for development in
non-coastal areas.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:32.177
And this creates a problem,
particularly for the Midwest,

00:10:32.177 --> 00:10:36.620
because the Midwest is not a
population center in the nation.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.875
So that transmissions needed to
relieve congestion in the

00:10:39.875 --> 00:10:42.898
existing system to improve
system reliability for all

00:10:42.898 --> 00:10:45.817
customers,
to increase access to

00:10:45.817 --> 00:10:50.322
lower-cost energy,
but also to access new and

00:10:50.322 --> 00:10:53.168
remote generation resources.
 

00:10:53.168 --> 00:10:58.960
So that if the twenty percent
scenario by 2030 is followed,

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.706
this is going to have a very
significant effect on Co2

00:11:01.706 --> 00:11:03.778
emissions from the electricity
sector.

00:11:03.778 --> 00:11:09.668
So that this is thought of as a
really important type of

00:11:09.668 --> 00:11:11.058
investment.
 

00:11:11.058 --> 00:11:17.080
Now siting often creates an
enormously complex set of rules

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:22.893
and regulations that have to be
followed in order to gain

00:11:22.893 --> 00:11:27.149
permits from the federal
government,

00:11:27.149 --> 00:11:29.490
state governments,
and local governments.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:33.769
The predominant concerns about
development include visual

00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:36.288
impacts,
property value impacts,

00:11:36.288 --> 00:11:39.210
effects on local wildlife and
habitat,

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.678
turbine or rotor noise and land
use,

00:11:43.678 --> 00:11:47.980
potential effects on adjacent
land uses.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.912
So wind generation is,
for example,

00:11:50.912 --> 00:11:55.741
responsible for about 0.003
percent of human-caused avian

00:11:55.741 --> 00:12:00.399
mortality, particularly among
passerines and bats.

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:02.793
And bat mortality has been
found to be higher than

00:12:02.793 --> 00:12:04.927
expected,
but only in certain areas of

00:12:04.927 --> 00:12:08.410
the world,
in certain high elevation

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:13.129
zones, mountain peaks,
and also mountain passes.

00:12:13.129 --> 00:12:18.138
So that these are the
predominant concerns that cause

00:12:18.138 --> 00:12:19.389
litigation.
 

00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:23.102
People are also worried about
the amount of area that it's

00:12:23.102 --> 00:12:27.207
going to take in order to reach
this objective of twenty percent

00:12:27.207 --> 00:12:27.990
by 2030.
 

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:32.538
And the actual footprint that
has been measured and is being

00:12:32.538 --> 00:12:37.320
used by the proponents of wind
energy is really quite small.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.139
So total acreage of about
fifteen million acres,

00:12:41.139 --> 00:12:45.529
roughly about the size of Rhode
Island or Anchorage.

00:12:45.529 --> 00:12:50.984
So that the deceptive aspect of
that statistic is that the

00:12:50.984 --> 00:12:56.341
conflict that surrounds this is
not generated by the site

00:12:56.341 --> 00:13:00.168
development and the amount of
area,

00:13:00.168 --> 00:13:03.106
the land area or the ocean area
that has to be disturbed in

00:13:03.106 --> 00:13:06.186
order to put the facilities in,
it's generated by its

00:13:06.186 --> 00:13:10.062
visibility, predominantly by
people's impressions that I find

00:13:10.062 --> 00:13:12.000
to be really quite curious.
 

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.179
I was driving to work this
morning and admiring the wind

00:13:16.179 --> 00:13:20.970
turbine that was just put up
over here next to the Q-Bridge,

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.702
and was thinking about that and
thinking about people's

00:13:24.702 --> 00:13:28.711
acceptance or preferences to
view landscapes without towers

00:13:28.711 --> 00:13:29.678
generally.
 

00:13:29.678 --> 00:13:32.918
And as I kind of surveyed the
landscape quickly,

00:13:32.918 --> 00:13:36.075
I was looking at the old
coal-fired power plant next to

00:13:36.075 --> 00:13:38.860
the Q-Bridge,
then I was looking at the

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.820
transmission lines that lie next
to it.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.470
I was looking at the bridge
itself.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.250
Really an industrialized
landscape.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.967
Probably not a good thing to
say to people here for Yale

00:13:47.967 --> 00:13:48.710
Bulldog Days.
 

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:53.211
There are very beautiful parts
of New Haven and the university

00:13:53.211 --> 00:13:56.460
is a central source of New
Haven's beauty.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.462
But that part of New Haven is
not, it's one of the most

00:14:00.462 --> 00:14:03.278
industrialized zones in
Connecticut.

00:14:03.278 --> 00:14:07.610
But there stands this new wind
turbine, gleaming white.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.774
And actually,
it's dwarfed by other stacks,

00:14:10.774 --> 00:14:14.389
smokestacks and the
transmission lines nearby.

00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:17.190
But people have problems with
towers generally,

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.200
and I was wondering about that.
 

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.200
And I've worked on tower siting
problems in the past.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.710
And I used the example when we
had the lecture on land

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:29.419
preservation of the controversy
over the Olympic Games in

00:14:29.419 --> 00:14:33.129
northern New York where the
ninety- and seventy-meter ski

00:14:33.129 --> 00:14:37.104
jump were proposed that almost
brought the Olympic Games to a

00:14:37.104 --> 00:14:41.408
halt because of threatened
litigation by the Sierra Club.

00:14:41.408 --> 00:14:45.335
And the aversion there was the
loss of the sense of a natural

00:14:45.335 --> 00:14:46.120
landscape.
 

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.139
And this is very much a
prominent part of the argument

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:54.993
on the part of landowners in the
coastal area that looks out over

00:14:54.993 --> 00:14:56.509
Nantucket Sound.
 

00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:58.548
They're worried about the view.
 

00:14:58.548 --> 00:15:00.178
They're worried about the
visibility.

00:15:00.178 --> 00:15:02.893
Somehow, they think it's going
to diminish the sense of

00:15:02.893 --> 00:15:05.655
naturalness of that landscape,
and that's provoked their

00:15:05.655 --> 00:15:06.408
litigation.
 

00:15:06.408 --> 00:15:10.990
So that there are other kinds
of towers that we seem to

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.260
accept,
but it may be a function of

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.418
whether or not we can get up
into the tower to take a look.

00:15:16.418 --> 00:15:19.955
Many people up in Lake Placid
eventually accepted a 300-foot

00:15:19.955 --> 00:15:23.130
tower as a ski jump that was
immediately adjacent to a

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.330
wilderness area.
 

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.558
But part of the fascination was
well,

00:15:27.558 --> 00:15:30.339
this is for sport,
but it also is going to give

00:15:30.339 --> 00:15:33.721
the opportunity to create an
observation deck that people

00:15:33.721 --> 00:15:34.870
could go up to.
 

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.594
I was thinking about other
towers that we seem to readily

00:15:37.594 --> 00:15:39.590
accept in more urbanized
environments,

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.730
residential towers,
office buildings,

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.370
or even the Eiffel Tower.
 

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:47.652
So that what is it about towers
and our sense of naturalness

00:15:47.652 --> 00:15:50.408
that provokes this kind of
reaction?

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:53.654
I've also worked on
communication towers and

00:15:53.654 --> 00:15:57.879
electrical transmission lines
that demand high towers.

00:15:57.879 --> 00:16:04.524
And these are commonly fought
with great energy just as people

00:16:04.524 --> 00:16:08.120
are fighting the wind turbines.
 

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.732
So that that would be the
subject of a great senior essay,

00:16:11.732 --> 00:16:15.028
by the way, if anybody is
looking around for one next

00:16:15.028 --> 00:16:15.600
year.
 

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:21.183
Think about also the nature of
property rights to wind and to

00:16:21.183 --> 00:16:22.860
solar radiation.
 

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.379
So does the developer,
for example,

00:16:25.379 --> 00:16:29.998
have the right to block access
to a resource such as wind or

00:16:29.998 --> 00:16:33.932
solar radiation or water,
if you live upstream and you

00:16:33.932 --> 00:16:36.610
decide you want to put a dam in
the river?

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:41.870
Or sand, remember the shifting
sands on barrier islands,

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.566
and remember,
if you fly out of New Haven

00:16:44.566 --> 00:16:48.678
over the coastline and you see
these groins that are set up to

00:16:48.678 --> 00:16:51.779
trap sand as it moves along the
coastline.

00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:55.448
And that causes a sand deficit
downstream so that the person

00:16:55.448 --> 00:16:59.056
that lives next to you has to
build a groin so he can catch

00:16:59.056 --> 00:17:01.980
sand to prevent his shoreline
from eroding.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.230
The same basic principle here.
 

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:08.540
So that if I build a structure,
perhaps a high rise building

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:12.998
that blocks your access to wind
or even if I build a high rise

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:17.308
building and it blocks your
access to solar radiation,

00:17:17.308 --> 00:17:22.257
do you have the right to take
me to court and either to

00:17:22.257 --> 00:17:27.755
prevent the development or do I
have the right to demand that

00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:32.519
you compensate me for my
property loss in value?

00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:35.008
Well common law,
law passed by courts,

00:17:35.008 --> 00:17:38.707
is really unclear on the matter
unless there's clear and

00:17:38.707 --> 00:17:40.118
malicious intent.
 

00:17:40.118 --> 00:17:43.832
So unlike underground minerals,
no one can extract wind or

00:17:43.832 --> 00:17:47.608
solar radiation from your
property without your consent.

00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:52.059
Now, I want you to think back
about the lecture several weeks

00:17:52.059 --> 00:17:56.732
ago when I considered the Horse
Whisperer out in Wyoming and the

00:17:56.732 --> 00:18:00.589
extraordinarily rapid
development of coal bed methane

00:18:00.589 --> 00:18:05.188
gas being extracted because the
federal government sold off the

00:18:05.188 --> 00:18:09.490
underlying property rights to
private corporations who then

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:13.272
basically had the right to
transfer their production

00:18:13.272 --> 00:18:17.650
equipment to build towers on
people's ranches,

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:20.970
on their private lands.
 

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:23.393
So the story was the Horse
Whisperer woke up to

00:18:23.393 --> 00:18:26.450
construction crews bulldozing
roads over their property.

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.682
And outraged,
thought that he had the right

00:18:28.682 --> 00:18:31.180
to call the police and stop the
development,

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.656
when he didn't,
because those gas extraction

00:18:33.656 --> 00:18:36.825
companies had purchased the
rights legitimately from the

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:37.690
government.
 

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:42.678
Well, in this case are the wind
or solar radiation rights

00:18:42.678 --> 00:18:46.952
similarly owned as common
property by the federal

00:18:46.952 --> 00:18:48.289
government?
 

00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:49.818
And the answer is no.
 

00:18:49.818 --> 00:18:53.848
So that you would have the
opportunity to prevent somebody

00:18:53.848 --> 00:18:57.880
from coming onto your land and
building a wind turbine.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.500
But kind of an interesting
comparison here,

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:04.326
the way that law is structured
to allocate common property

00:19:04.326 --> 00:19:08.900
rights to the private sector for
energy development.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:12.666
So think about wind capacity
and the desirability of

00:19:12.666 --> 00:19:16.903
different areas of the country,
and also think about the nature

00:19:16.903 --> 00:19:19.348
of private development in the
coastal zone.

00:19:19.348 --> 00:19:24.238
And I remember the California
oil spills and how the tar and

00:19:24.238 --> 00:19:27.470
the oil would wash up on the
beaches.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:31.130
And it was kind of interesting,
you'd go for a run on the beach

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:34.790
and you get back to your house
or wherever you were staying and

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.740
your feet are covered by tar.
 

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.951
Even today in some parts of
California, they're covered by

00:19:39.951 --> 00:19:43.220
tar from the Santa Barbara oil
spills back in the 1970s.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:48.394
So that these tend to be highly
developable properties,

00:19:48.394 --> 00:19:50.788
highly valued property.
 

00:19:50.788 --> 00:19:55.467
And if they are the site of
residential structures,

00:19:55.467 --> 00:20:00.330
you're guaranteed to have a
fight for any significant

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.670
offshore development.
 

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:07.273
So there's an interesting kind
of coincidence here of high-end

00:20:07.273 --> 00:20:10.398
property,
people that are likely to have

00:20:10.398 --> 00:20:15.134
values that are instinctively to
protect the coastal zone as well

00:20:15.134 --> 00:20:19.574
as to protect the naturalness of
the views from their private

00:20:19.574 --> 00:20:20.608
property.
 

00:20:20.608 --> 00:20:26.991
So that this conflict is the
source of litigation and also

00:20:26.991 --> 00:20:28.558
legislation.
 

00:20:28.558 --> 00:20:36.298
Here are the top ten states for
wind energy potential.

00:20:36.298 --> 00:20:40.217
The last slide I showed you was
top ten states for current

00:20:40.217 --> 00:20:41.730
generating capacity.
 

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.759
So Texas, Kansas,
Montana and Nebraska,

00:20:44.759 --> 00:20:48.881
Midwestern states and Texas
particularly in the coastal as

00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:50.329
well,
South Dakota,

00:20:50.329 --> 00:20:52.339
North Dakota,
Iowa, Wyoming,

00:20:52.339 --> 00:20:53.798
Oklahoma, New Mexico.
 

00:20:53.798 --> 00:20:57.154
So very interesting that these
have the highest capacity,

00:20:57.154 --> 00:21:00.750
but they tend not to be close
to where the majority of people

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:01.410
in the U.S.
 

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:02.009
live.
 

00:21:02.009 --> 00:21:05.808
I'm going to jump ahead here.
 

00:21:05.808 --> 00:21:08.574
So here is the scenario,
offshore development versus

00:21:08.574 --> 00:21:09.930
land-based development.
 

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:13.267
The projections are that the
majority of new capacity will

00:21:13.267 --> 00:21:16.955
come from onshore or land-based
development that creates all the

00:21:16.955 --> 00:21:20.353
political conflict because of
questions about how to manage

00:21:20.353 --> 00:21:22.108
private property rights.
 

00:21:22.108 --> 00:21:27.346
So that if you look at the
quantity available offshore and

00:21:27.346 --> 00:21:32.398
onshore and you look at the
relative wind speed in these

00:21:32.398 --> 00:21:35.863
areas,
you see that the land-based is

00:21:35.863 --> 00:21:40.690
going to likely generate more
gigawatts than the offshore.

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:42.700
So what are the key benefits
here?

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.864
Well, benefits to the
environment, benefits in terms

00:21:46.864 --> 00:21:50.618
of reduced air pollution from
fossil fuels,

00:21:50.618 --> 00:21:54.113
and there's no question about
the fact that we'll be facing

00:21:54.113 --> 00:21:57.365
increased coal generation,
coal power generation,

00:21:57.365 --> 00:22:00.717
that is going to give us
problems with particulate

00:22:00.717 --> 00:22:03.278
matter,
sulfur and nitrogen oxides.

00:22:03.278 --> 00:22:06.848
And remember that statistic
that I told you last week,

00:22:06.848 --> 00:22:09.868
that this is a really important
statistic,

00:22:09.868 --> 00:22:14.170
particularly relative to the
health effects of coal.

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.846
Between 30,000 and 60,000
people are estimated in a

00:22:17.846 --> 00:22:22.700
variety of peer-reviewed and I
think highly defensible studies,

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:28.362
they suffer premature death in
the United States every year due

00:22:28.362 --> 00:22:30.278
to coal production.
 

00:22:30.278 --> 00:22:34.566
So that you compare that to
nuclear, you compare that to

00:22:34.566 --> 00:22:38.461
mortality estimates from wind or
solar development,

00:22:38.461 --> 00:22:41.190
and there really is no contest.
 

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:45.448
In terms of climate,
the reduced CO_2

00:22:45.448 --> 00:22:50.817
emissions are estimated to be
about 825 million metric tons

00:22:50.817 --> 00:22:56.373
per year if the twenty percent
of our electricity is produced

00:22:56.373 --> 00:22:57.670
by 2030.
 

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:59.936
Reduced water,
reduced coal use,

00:22:59.936 --> 00:23:04.105
reduced cost per kilowatt hour,
and also the increased tax

00:23:04.105 --> 00:23:08.130
revenues that'll be generated to
local communities.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.196
So if you build a wind turbine
on your property,

00:23:11.196 --> 00:23:15.243
you're going to have to pay the
local government property taxes

00:23:15.243 --> 00:23:16.548
on your revenue.
 

00:23:16.548 --> 00:23:19.576
And also you're going to be
paying the federal government

00:23:19.576 --> 00:23:20.818
taxes on the revenue.
 

00:23:20.818 --> 00:23:24.990
So the future of wind,
as I mentioned earlier,

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:28.663
is likely to have the greatest
influence on our reliance on

00:23:28.663 --> 00:23:31.267
coal,
but could also affect our

00:23:31.267 --> 00:23:33.029
reliance on nuclear.
 

00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:37.917
There's a lot of concern among
environmentalists over avian

00:23:37.917 --> 00:23:38.930
mortality.
 

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.857
So it's important to think
about the different causes of

00:23:41.857 --> 00:23:45.034
avian mortality,
and it's quite striking that

00:23:45.034 --> 00:23:48.048
mortality from buildings and
windows,

00:23:48.048 --> 00:23:52.950
and these are avian deaths,
so that you see that the

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:58.619
majority are being caused by
birds flying into buildings and

00:23:58.619 --> 00:24:01.321
windows,
followed by housecats,

00:24:01.321 --> 00:24:04.910
high transmission lines,
vehicles, pesticides.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.720
Actually, the pesticide
estimate is low.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:12.460
I worked on a panel that
addressed the question about

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:18.436
several of the largest,
most produced insecticides in

00:24:18.436 --> 00:24:22.188
the world,
and they are responsible for

00:24:22.188 --> 00:24:24.690
very significant avian losses.
 

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:28.941
Communication towers and wind
turbines, if they reach this

00:24:28.941 --> 00:24:32.595
twenty percent by 2030,
are projected to be really

00:24:32.595 --> 00:24:33.640
quite low.
 

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.055
Now, that doesn't mean that we
don't pay attention to them,

00:24:36.055 --> 00:24:37.930
and legally we have an
obligation to do so.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:40.890
And that's because of the
Endangered Species Act.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:45.550
And this will come to play when
we talk in a few minutes about

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:49.755
the Nantucket Sound case that
might influence the piping

00:24:49.755 --> 00:24:53.500
plover that nests in the
adjacent shorelines.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:59.877
Also, there are concerns about
noise, how noisy are they

00:24:59.877 --> 00:25:04.170
compared to other sources of
noise?

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:08.170
So if you look at jet aircraft
at 250 meters,

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:11.670
you look a pneumatic drill,
you look at a truck,

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:15.673
an office, a car at forty
meters, then you find a

00:25:15.673 --> 00:25:20.680
wind-power plant at 350 meters
would be about equivalent to a

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:25.852
quiet bedroom or perhaps a car
operating at forty miles an hour

00:25:25.852 --> 00:25:29.440
that drives by a hundred meters
away.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:34.799
So the implications of this are
kind of interesting in terms of

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:36.269
managing noise.
 

00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:37.910
How might you do that?
 

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:40.108
Well, you could think about
using zoning.

00:25:40.108 --> 00:25:43.318
You could demand very large lot
zoning.

00:25:43.318 --> 00:25:46.877
And remember the case in the
Adirondacks where one new house

00:25:46.877 --> 00:25:50.980
for perhaps forty percent of the
private land in the Adirondacks,

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:54.180
forty percent of two and a half
million acres.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.095
So one new house requires
forty-three acres up in the

00:25:57.095 --> 00:25:57.880
Adirondacks.
 

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.961
So what would it take you to
get a buffer between the turbine

00:26:01.961 --> 00:26:05.500
location on land and a
separation distance that would

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:09.038
reduce the decibel level on
adjacent properties?

00:26:09.038 --> 00:26:11.866
Well, you could imagine
designing a zoning ordinance

00:26:11.866 --> 00:26:15.304
that would allow you to control
noise on adjacent lands in that

00:26:15.304 --> 00:26:15.970
fashion.
 

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:23.296
Well, it's important for you to
think too about the structure of

00:26:23.296 --> 00:26:24.460
the U.S.
 

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:25.548
utility industry.
 

00:26:25.548 --> 00:26:28.329
There are about two hundred
investor-owned utilities in the

00:26:28.329 --> 00:26:30.743
nation,
seventy large municipal and

00:26:30.743 --> 00:26:33.926
federal or state systems,
fifty rural generation and

00:26:33.926 --> 00:26:36.880
transmission cooperatives,
and three thousand local

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.490
distribution companies.
 

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:43.471
Think also about who are the
dominant consumers of energy in

00:26:43.471 --> 00:26:45.160
the United States.
 

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.749
Turns out that the federal
government is the largest single

00:26:47.749 --> 00:26:49.490
consumer of electricity in the
world.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:54.749
The federal agency electricity
consumption in 2005 was more

00:26:54.749 --> 00:26:58.673
than 55,000 gigawatt hours,
which would equate to

00:26:58.673 --> 00:27:01.598
approximately eighteen gigawatts
of wind capacity.

00:27:01.598 --> 00:27:05.035
So federal agencies were
encouraged to meet an executive

00:27:05.035 --> 00:27:08.781
order goal of two point five
percent of site electricity from

00:27:08.781 --> 00:27:12.028
new renewable energy sources by
the end of 2005.

00:27:12.028 --> 00:27:15.060
By the way, we've not talked
about executive orders in the

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:17.278
class,
but I'm going to pause here

00:27:17.278 --> 00:27:21.269
just to point out that law may
be established at very different

00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:24.710
levels of government,
state, local, federal.

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:27.630
But also it may be established
by regulation,

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:31.480
so EPA has the legal authority
to establish regulations.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.190
And the Executive Branch of the
government,

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:37.352
the office of the President,
has the legal authority to

00:27:37.352 --> 00:27:41.040
establish executive orders that
must be complied with within the

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.558
federal government by federal
agencies.

00:27:43.558 --> 00:27:48.064
So that in this case,
to meet the ordered goal of two

00:27:48.064 --> 00:27:52.094
point five percent,
this goal was actually exceeded

00:27:52.094 --> 00:27:55.656
with a final tally of about six
point nine percent of

00:27:55.656 --> 00:27:59.700
electricity consumed was derived
from renewable sources.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.288
So that's kind of an
interesting idea.

00:28:01.288 --> 00:28:04.534
So figure out who are the
largest consumers and then set

00:28:04.534 --> 00:28:06.775
goals for them and then
challenge them,

00:28:06.775 --> 00:28:08.250
set up a competition.
 

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:12.175
And we've seen that competitive
spirit work here in the college

00:28:12.175 --> 00:28:12.808
as well.
 

00:28:12.808 --> 00:28:18.067
So that colleges are trying to
not just reduce their waste and

00:28:18.067 --> 00:28:21.430
to increase their rate of
recycling,

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.558
but they're also trying to
reduce their energy consumption.

00:28:24.558 --> 00:28:27.730
So that now the federal
agencies are all challenged to

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:30.959
try to figure out how they can
increase their renewable

00:28:30.959 --> 00:28:34.130
component of their energy
consumption portfolios.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:38.352
There's also the concept of
renewable energy credits and

00:28:38.352 --> 00:28:40.808
renewable energy certificates.
 

00:28:40.808 --> 00:28:44.528
And these are tradable
non-tangible energy commodities

00:28:44.528 --> 00:28:45.440
in the U.S.
 

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:49.010
that represent proof that one
megawatt hour of electricity was

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:52.288
generated from an eligible
renewable energy resource,

00:28:52.288 --> 00:28:55.630
which would include solar,
wind, geothermal,

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:59.904
hydro, biomass or energy
derived from hydrogen fuel

00:28:59.904 --> 00:29:00.588
cells.
 

00:29:00.588 --> 00:29:06.358
Now, I want to talk for a few
moments about the problem up in

00:29:06.358 --> 00:29:08.088
Nantucket Sound.
 

00:29:08.088 --> 00:29:12.980
And this is a project,
Cape Wind, that was initiated

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:18.353
in 2001 when this company
decided that they wanted to put

00:29:18.353 --> 00:29:22.670
up about 130 turbines in
Nantucket Sound.

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:26.568
And the state of Rhode Island,
by the way,

00:29:26.568 --> 00:29:28.839
has taken a very different
path, not just reacting to a

00:29:28.839 --> 00:29:32.186
developer's proposal,
but Rhode Island has taken the

00:29:32.186 --> 00:29:36.240
initiative to zone parts of its
offshore territory.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.558
And they have designated a
company, a developer,

00:29:40.558 --> 00:29:45.521
as a preferred developer,
and have now proposed about a

00:29:45.521 --> 00:29:49.750
$1.5 billion farm in eastern
Rhode Island.

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:54.906
So states could basically be
reactive in their approach to

00:29:54.906 --> 00:29:57.170
developing wind energy.
 

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:59.098
Just wait for the developers to
show up.

00:29:59.098 --> 00:30:03.114
But Rhode Island is taking a
very different approach to this,

00:30:03.114 --> 00:30:06.326
so that they are in a way
acting as the developer

00:30:06.326 --> 00:30:07.328
themselves.
 

00:30:07.328 --> 00:30:12.547
So if you take a look at this
wind map of the southern New

00:30:12.547 --> 00:30:16.276
England coastline,
you see that there are areas,

00:30:16.276 --> 00:30:19.763
particularly off of Rhode
Island and particularly here in

00:30:19.763 --> 00:30:23.211
Nantucket Sound,
which are really quite suitable

00:30:23.211 --> 00:30:27.334
in terms of the amount of wind
energy that is available for

00:30:27.334 --> 00:30:28.400
development.
 

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:33.380
So the Cape Wind proposal would
involve, as I said,

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:35.868
130 different turbines.
 

00:30:35.868 --> 00:30:39.554
On average, it would provide
about seventy-five percent of

00:30:39.554 --> 00:30:42.785
the entire electrical
requirements for the Cape and

00:30:42.785 --> 00:30:43.818
the islands.
 

00:30:43.818 --> 00:30:48.509
So I don't know if this is
going to work.

00:30:48.509 --> 00:30:54.940
But let me see if I can show
you a YouTube video here,

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:56.759
just briefly.
 

00:30:56.759 --> 00:31:01.913
Here is a scene that shows a
boat of sightseers just moving

00:31:01.913 --> 00:31:06.180
through a wind farm off the
coast of Denmark,

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.420
just to give you a sense of
what it would be like.

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:12.828
Now, there are questions here
about navigation.

00:31:12.828 --> 00:31:15.321
There are questions about
interference with others'

00:31:15.321 --> 00:31:16.220
property rights.
 

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:19.423
So offshore waters,
if you're beyond the three-mile

00:31:19.423 --> 00:31:22.818
jurisdictional limit then it
becomes federal lands.

00:31:22.818 --> 00:31:26.440
If you're between the mean high
water mark and the three-mile

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.068
zone, that is state land.
 

00:31:28.068 --> 00:31:32.017
And what this means is because
these power lines will have to

00:31:32.017 --> 00:31:35.964
lie beneath the surface as they
run from the turbines back to

00:31:35.964 --> 00:31:39.061
the mainland,
that they clearly will cross

00:31:39.061 --> 00:31:41.588
from federal lands into state
lands.

00:31:41.588 --> 00:31:43.720
And then they will cross
private lands.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.890
Or in some instances,
they will require dredging of

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:52.058
wetland areas up onto local
government property.

00:31:52.058 --> 00:31:53.678
So that local,
state, federal,

00:31:53.678 --> 00:31:56.970
and private property rights are
all at play in this case.

00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:02.788
So that there are also issues
that arise from conflicts with

00:32:02.788 --> 00:32:08.608
fishermen who may have the right
to lobster in this area.

00:32:08.608 --> 00:32:13.824
Perhaps they use a form of
fishing that drags over the

00:32:13.824 --> 00:32:14.710
bottom.
 

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:18.619
These are known as the
Nantucket Shoals,

00:32:18.619 --> 00:32:22.230
known to be former clamming
areas.

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:26.153
The Nantucket area,
the Buzzard's Bay area,

00:32:26.153 --> 00:32:30.823
has a long and rich history as
being important as a

00:32:30.823 --> 00:32:34.279
commercially viable fishing
area.

00:32:34.279 --> 00:32:39.829
So that there are also
potential conflicts here with

00:32:39.829 --> 00:32:44.509
air rights with respect to
flight paths,

00:32:44.509 --> 00:32:47.140
so that the Federal Aviation
Administration is also involved.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:52.740
So that this is really a legal
quagmire in a way,

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.647
it's a cobweb of rights that
touch off jurisdiction on the

00:32:56.647 --> 00:33:00.625
part of three different levels
of government and many local

00:33:00.625 --> 00:33:04.464
jurisdictions and different
state and federal agencies as

00:33:04.464 --> 00:33:05.220
well.
 

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:10.234
So the location in the Sound
that is being proposed is pretty

00:33:10.234 --> 00:33:14.078
much between and to the north of
Nantucket,

00:33:14.078 --> 00:33:16.750
which lies over here on the
right side on the bottom,

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:20.330
and Martha's Vineyard,
roughly five to six miles

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:21.170
offshore.
 

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:24.550
Now, this has become most
controversial because that is

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:28.432
close enough so that the towers
would be visible from shoreline

00:33:28.432 --> 00:33:29.058
areas.
 

00:33:29.058 --> 00:33:33.483
So they've completed six years
of environmental studies of the

00:33:33.483 --> 00:33:37.167
surface and subsurface geology,
wind, tide, waves,

00:33:37.167 --> 00:33:41.483
sediment transport patterns,
benthic infauna and shellfish

00:33:41.483 --> 00:33:43.071
resources,
fish habitat,

00:33:43.071 --> 00:33:45.048
commercial and recreational
fisheries,

00:33:45.048 --> 00:33:48.257
and marine mammals and
threatened and endangered

00:33:48.257 --> 00:33:48.940
species.
 

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:53.616
And what's interesting about
this is also that they've been

00:33:53.616 --> 00:33:55.150
quite successful.
 

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:57.977
Cape Wind, the corporation,
has been successful in federal

00:33:57.977 --> 00:33:58.920
court litigation.
 

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:03.707
So that all of the permitting
on the part of local governments

00:34:03.707 --> 00:34:07.160
and the state government,
is now complete.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.650
This also fell under the
requirements of the National

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:14.612
Environmental Policy Act that
demanded that an environmental

00:34:14.612 --> 00:34:16.829
impact statement be prepared.
 

00:34:16.829 --> 00:34:23.483
And this was done with great
care and it also pointed to all

00:34:23.483 --> 00:34:28.023
of the possible effects on fish,
on wildlife,

00:34:28.023 --> 00:34:31.739
on endangered species,
but also was clear in

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:38.487
identifying conflicts between
the developers and the wind

00:34:38.487 --> 00:34:45.114
turbines with the various
interest groups that currently

00:34:45.114 --> 00:34:49.090
have rights to use the area.
 

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:55.304
So that state permitting status
is complete as of the Fall of

00:34:55.304 --> 00:34:56.030
2008.
 

00:34:56.030 --> 00:35:00.889
And there's a Facility Siting
Board in Massachusetts.

00:35:00.889 --> 00:35:05.260
There is a state environmental
quality permitting process that

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:07.768
was required to be complied
with.

00:35:07.768 --> 00:35:12.088
There also are state wetlands
laws in Massachusetts that are

00:35:12.088 --> 00:35:16.260
particularly protective of
coastal wetlands so that all of

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.190
these permits have been now
granted.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:22.322
The federal permitting status
is managed by the Minerals

00:35:22.322 --> 00:35:24.773
Management Service,
and that sits within the

00:35:24.773 --> 00:35:26.539
Department of the Interior.
 

00:35:26.539 --> 00:35:33.572
So that a favorable draft
impact statement was prepared in

00:35:33.572 --> 00:35:40.233
2004 and then it released a
favorable final Environment

00:35:40.233 --> 00:35:45.539
Impact Statement on January 15
of 2008.

00:35:45.539 --> 00:35:49.039
Favorable comments on the part
of different organizations,

00:35:49.039 --> 00:35:50.829
including the Natural Resources
Defense Council,

00:35:50.829 --> 00:35:54.371
known for being very protective
of coastal areas around the

00:35:54.371 --> 00:35:58.340
nation and being very concerned
about issues of climate change.

00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:01.166
"Cape Wind (NRDC argued)
is to our knowledge the largest

00:36:01.166 --> 00:36:03.806
single source of supply-side
reductions in CO_2

00:36:03.806 --> 00:36:06.351
currently proposed in the United
States and perhaps the

00:36:06.351 --> 00:36:07.199
world."
 

00:36:07.199 --> 00:36:10.619
And the Department of Energy
assistant secretary said,

00:36:10.619 --> 00:36:13.550
"As the first
shallow-water offshore project

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:15.809
under review in the United
States,

00:36:15.809 --> 00:36:18.268
utility-scale projects like
Cape Wind are important to our

00:36:18.268 --> 00:36:20.686
national interests and a crucial
first step to building a

00:36:20.686 --> 00:36:22.929
domestic globally competitive
wind supply."

00:36:22.929 --> 00:36:26.409
And another former
U.S. Department of Energy

00:36:26.409 --> 00:36:30.701
assistant secretary and now
Massachusetts Secretary of

00:36:30.701 --> 00:36:34.836
Environmental Officers,
Susan Tierney commented,

00:36:34.836 --> 00:36:38.751
"The Cape Wind draft
environmental impact statement

00:36:38.751 --> 00:36:40.670
is thorough,
it's detailed.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:44.195
It identifies and analyzes and
describes a wide array of

00:36:44.195 --> 00:36:47.849
impacts with great care,
detail, and comprehensiveness.

00:36:47.849 --> 00:36:49.929
Indeed, it's one of the most
thorough that I've ever

00:36:49.929 --> 00:36:50.460
seen."
 

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.280
So wide support among a variety
of different agencies.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:59.056
Now, right now the Cape Wind
Company is awaiting a decision

00:36:59.056 --> 00:37:04.434
on the part of Ken Salazar,
who is the Secretary of the

00:37:04.434 --> 00:37:05.730
Interior.
 

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:11.572
And Ken Salazar is responsible
for the National Park Service

00:37:11.572 --> 00:37:17.018
that also sits within the
Department of the Interior.

00:37:17.018 --> 00:37:20.320
And you might ask the question,
well, what does the Park

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:23.500
Service have to do with
permitting for a facility such

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:24.219
as this?
 

00:37:24.219 --> 00:37:27.603
Well, the Park Service
curiously is responsible because

00:37:27.603 --> 00:37:30.360
of the National Historic
Preservation Act.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:34.414
This requires that historic
facilities in the United States

00:37:34.414 --> 00:37:38.469
be identified and ranked for
their relative importance,

00:37:38.469 --> 00:37:40.630
and if they're found to be of
national significance,

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:43.996
they are eligible to be placed
on the National Registry of

00:37:43.996 --> 00:37:45.059
Historic Places.
 

00:37:45.059 --> 00:37:50.106
So that the Secretary of the
Interior-- I'm going to have to

00:37:50.106 --> 00:37:52.760
jump ahead here for a second.
 

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:58.097
The Secretary of the Interior
had the ability to decide that

00:37:58.097 --> 00:38:03.342
either the national significance
of this as Native American

00:38:03.342 --> 00:38:08.498
burial grounds was so high that
it would be designated and

00:38:08.498 --> 00:38:14.469
therefore this wind farm would
not be allowed to go forward.

00:38:14.469 --> 00:38:17.748
And he's committed to reaching
a conclusion about this within

00:38:17.748 --> 00:38:20.454
the next two weeks,
so pay attention to the press,

00:38:20.454 --> 00:38:22.559
it will turn out to be quite
interesting.

00:38:22.559 --> 00:38:26.786
So the Secretary went out and
took a look at the site several

00:38:26.786 --> 00:38:30.521
months ago and has held a
variety of press conferences

00:38:30.521 --> 00:38:34.467
over the past couple of weeks
that demonstrate that he is

00:38:34.467 --> 00:38:38.644
really on the edge,
not knowing whether or not he

00:38:38.644 --> 00:38:43.335
should be pursuing the national
objective of increasing the

00:38:43.335 --> 00:38:47.460
renewable energy portfolio of
the United States.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.197
I'm going to have to jump ahead
here, because I've got way too

00:38:50.197 --> 00:38:51.590
much material,
so forgive me.

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:56.797
I wanted to talk just a moment
about comparing this case to

00:38:56.797 --> 00:39:02.186
other kinds of problems that
we've discussed in class or that

00:39:02.186 --> 00:39:06.672
you may be familiar with,
and the idea of the government

00:39:06.672 --> 00:39:09.480
role of providing either credits
or subsidies.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:14.193
I want you to think about the
relative historical absence of

00:39:14.193 --> 00:39:18.905
federal subsidy of renewable
energy sources and compare that

00:39:18.905 --> 00:39:23.780
to the subsidies that have
occurred for the oil industry.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:28.134
And perhaps the greatest
subsidy that I can think of is

00:39:28.134 --> 00:39:32.971
in part a reflection on what
happened when a major automobile

00:39:32.971 --> 00:39:36.614
company,
tire company and oil companies

00:39:36.614 --> 00:39:41.201
in the early 1900s went around
to different cities and

00:39:41.201 --> 00:39:45.710
purchased up the trolley lines,
the tram lines.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:50.402
They purchased them up as a way
of diminishing the public's

00:39:50.402 --> 00:39:54.934
ability to use public transit
and to develop an increased

00:39:54.934 --> 00:39:57.199
reliance on automobiles.
 

00:39:57.199 --> 00:40:02.186
Now think also about the
national cost to maintain and

00:40:02.186 --> 00:40:06.610
build or rebuild our national
highway system.

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:10.559
And where would the auto
industry and the oil industry be

00:40:10.559 --> 00:40:14.793
in the United States if that
were not accomplished by our tax

00:40:14.793 --> 00:40:15.639
dollars?
 

00:40:15.639 --> 00:40:20.065
So now I think about the
highway system as being really

00:40:20.065 --> 00:40:25.230
an enormous subsidy for the oil
industry as well as for the auto

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:26.460
industries.
 

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:31.474
Think also about how we have in
the past year subsidized the

00:40:31.474 --> 00:40:36.574
auto industry and banks as well,
so that how do we come to

00:40:36.574 --> 00:40:41.760
choose to subsidize certain
private ventures and not others?

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.630
We have a clear problem that we
need to deal with there.

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:48.992
I also want you think about a
variety of different conclusions

00:40:48.992 --> 00:40:51.710
with respect to land use
regulation.

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:55.114
We've looked at land use
regulation and we've looked at

00:40:55.114 --> 00:40:58.835
problems of controlling private
behavior, taking away rights

00:40:58.835 --> 00:41:01.170
from individuals on private
land.

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:05.947
And I want you to think about
the opportunities for a variety

00:41:05.947 --> 00:41:10.724
of new land use regulation and
subdivision regulation schemes

00:41:10.724 --> 00:41:14.070
that might zone lands for wind
farms,

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:16.592
so that if you think back on
the Adirondack Park zoning

00:41:16.592 --> 00:41:19.045
scheme,
where they did zone certain

00:41:19.045 --> 00:41:21.179
areas for industrial growth.
 

00:41:21.179 --> 00:41:24.813
They zoned other areas for
agricultural growth,

00:41:24.813 --> 00:41:29.079
food farms, that why not the
concept of zoning for wind

00:41:29.079 --> 00:41:29.869
farms?
 

00:41:29.869 --> 00:41:33.317
Now, you could argue that well,
if you're going to zone for

00:41:33.317 --> 00:41:35.367
wind farms,
you need to think about how

00:41:35.367 --> 00:41:37.847
you're going to manage the
externalities that might fall

00:41:37.847 --> 00:41:39.110
onto adjacent landowners.
 

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:42.710
Well, that could be dealt with,
as I mentioned a few moments

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:44.420
ago, in a variety of ways.
 

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:49.447
And these might include
offering development credits to

00:41:49.447 --> 00:41:54.289
adjacent landowners to increase
density elsewhere.

00:41:54.289 --> 00:41:57.096
In other words,
transferable development rights

00:41:57.096 --> 00:42:00.329
might be a component of these
land use regulations.

00:42:00.329 --> 00:42:04.510
So that the adjacent landowners
are actually given a bonus,

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:08.485
they're given a development
right that would be assignable

00:42:08.485 --> 00:42:12.460
to an area that was zoned to
receive increased density.

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:14.786
These would be bankable,
so they wouldn't have to

00:42:14.786 --> 00:42:15.949
physically develop it.
 

00:42:15.949 --> 00:42:18.702
They could put the credit into
a bank and somebody else,

00:42:18.702 --> 00:42:21.856
another developer who wanted to
build in that high-density zone,

00:42:21.856 --> 00:42:23.409
could purchase that credit.
 

00:42:23.409 --> 00:42:27.849
So there's a potential here to
tie zoning for wind farms to

00:42:27.849 --> 00:42:30.530
transferrable development
rights.

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:32.936
Require minimum acreages,
a hundred acres,

00:42:32.936 --> 00:42:34.992
two hundred acres,
a thousand acres,

00:42:34.992 --> 00:42:36.460
whatever it would be.
 

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:38.469
And regulate lot dimensions.
 

00:42:38.469 --> 00:42:42.192
So you could imagine a thousand
acres in a relatively narrow

00:42:42.192 --> 00:42:44.400
strip of land going on for
miles.

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:48.369
But you could also think about
how you might design lot

00:42:48.369 --> 00:42:52.998
dimension requirements in a way
that would ensure that you would

00:42:52.998 --> 00:42:57.262
have a separation distance from
the turbine to the adjacent

00:42:57.262 --> 00:43:00.349
landowners that might sense a
fence.

00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:03.387
We also need to think carefully
about zoning for new

00:43:03.387 --> 00:43:04.639
transmission lines.
 

00:43:04.639 --> 00:43:09.853
And zoning in corridors has
always been a part of local and

00:43:09.853 --> 00:43:12.460
state land use regulations.
 

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:15.969
So think about where the
corridors are right here in New

00:43:15.969 --> 00:43:16.480
Haven.
 

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.103
We have a rail corridor that
also serves as a highway

00:43:19.103 --> 00:43:19.659
corridor.
 

00:43:19.659 --> 00:43:21.829
It's also a power line corridor.
 

00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:25.456
So that building new
transmission lines in areas

00:43:25.456 --> 00:43:30.007
where rail and highway corridors
already exist make a lot of

00:43:30.007 --> 00:43:30.780
sense.
 

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:34.056
If we have to buy new land to
create new transmission lines,

00:43:34.056 --> 00:43:36.612
that's going to be an
extraordinarily expensive

00:43:36.612 --> 00:43:37.280
venture.
 

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:42.326
And think about again this
problem of having the production

00:43:42.326 --> 00:43:47.632
being located in large distance
away from the points of higher

00:43:47.632 --> 00:43:51.199
population densities and
consumption.

00:43:51.199 --> 00:43:57.043
So another conclusion that I
want you to walk away with here

00:43:57.043 --> 00:44:00.710
is with respect to property
rights.

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:04.574
So that offshore development is
going to be much easier to

00:44:04.574 --> 00:44:07.150
accomplish than onshore
development.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:10.818
Now here we are in 2010,
the Cape Wind developers made

00:44:10.818 --> 00:44:12.550
their proposal in 2001.
 

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:15.731
They've wandered their way
through this regulatory

00:44:15.731 --> 00:44:18.070
permitting process for nine
years.

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:20.400
There's a lesson there.
 

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:24.170
The lesson has been followed in
a variety of other regulatory

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:26.809
contexts and it's called
one-stop shopping,

00:44:26.809 --> 00:44:29.010
one-stop shopping for a permit.
 

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:33.628
What if we had one renewable
agency, renewable energy agency

00:44:33.628 --> 00:44:37.780
that had all of the authority to
grant the permits?

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.927
And yes, they would have to
consult with state

00:44:39.927 --> 00:44:42.168
representatives,
they would have to consult with

00:44:42.168 --> 00:44:43.409
local representatives.
 

00:44:43.409 --> 00:44:46.603
But a developer could go
through this process perhaps in

00:44:46.603 --> 00:44:49.159
three or four years instead of
nine years.

00:44:49.159 --> 00:44:53.177
The capital carrying costs that
are involved here when you're

00:44:53.177 --> 00:44:56.994
purchasing property and trying
to figure out what state of

00:44:56.994 --> 00:44:59.539
technology you're going to
apply,

00:44:59.539 --> 00:45:02.550
capital costs here are enormous
and can be discouraging.

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:05.918
I mentioned the coal bed
methane issue and think

00:45:05.918 --> 00:45:10.146
distinctively about how that
coal bed methane property right

00:45:10.146 --> 00:45:14.090
was allowed to be purchased by
the private sector,

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:17.811
whereas the wind property
right, like the solar property

00:45:17.811 --> 00:45:20.452
right,
is generally assigned with the

00:45:20.452 --> 00:45:21.469
surface lands.
 

00:45:21.469 --> 00:45:24.050
So who has the right to block
wind?

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:25.420
Who has the right to block
solar radiation?

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:29.159
And are these legitimate bases
for civil actions as nuisances?

00:45:29.159 --> 00:45:32.875
Now, I'd like to close by
having you think about damages

00:45:32.875 --> 00:45:34.969
and how we calculate damages.
 

00:45:34.969 --> 00:45:38.094
And as you think about every
case that we've discussed in

00:45:38.094 --> 00:45:39.777
this term,
when we think about

00:45:39.777 --> 00:45:42.365
environmental effects,
you should be thinking about

00:45:42.365 --> 00:45:45.463
the magnitude of the effect and
you should be thinking about the

00:45:45.463 --> 00:45:46.940
distribution of the effect.
 

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:51.400
So think about this comparison
between nuclear power on the one

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.989
hand and wind energy on the
other.

00:45:53.989 --> 00:45:57.708
What are the adverse
environmental effects from wind

00:45:57.708 --> 00:45:59.239
power likely to be?
 

00:45:59.239 --> 00:46:01.621
Well, we've gone through a
variety of them,

00:46:01.621 --> 00:46:04.402
biological resources,
land area that's going to be

00:46:04.402 --> 00:46:05.139
required.
 

00:46:05.139 --> 00:46:09.320
But they all pale in response
to the problems associated with

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:13.152
constructing and operating
nuclear power plants and then

00:46:13.152 --> 00:46:16.150
figuring out what to do with the
waste.

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:19.130
And one way to think about
distribution is just to think

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:21.570
about how something spreads
geographically.

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:25.349
But think about distribution in
a temporal way as well.

00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:29.693
So that the fact that the
Environmental Protection Agency

00:46:29.693 --> 00:46:34.657
is required to develop a nuclear
waste disposal plan to cover one

00:46:34.657 --> 00:46:39.387
million years for the management
of the Yucca Mountain storage

00:46:39.387 --> 00:46:43.266
facility that has to do with the
persistence of the

00:46:43.266 --> 00:46:50.289
radionuclides,
particularly plutonium isotopes.

00:46:50.289 --> 00:46:53.239
I mean, think about that,
the persistence of the problem

00:46:53.239 --> 00:46:56.030
over time is another way to
consider distribution.

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:59.777
So the consideration of
magnitude and distribution as

00:46:59.777 --> 00:47:02.876
well, by thinking about
questions of equity,

00:47:02.876 --> 00:47:06.119
who are these damages going to
fall onto?

00:47:06.119 --> 00:47:08.400
How should they be managed?
 

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.637
And some people are much more
capable of managing risk than

00:47:11.637 --> 00:47:12.699
other people are.
 

00:47:12.699 --> 00:47:17.811
So they can buy higher quality
insurance than poorer people

00:47:17.811 --> 00:47:18.340
can.
 

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:21.179
So once again,
magnitude and distribution for

00:47:21.179 --> 00:47:23.889
a variety of different kinds of
effects.

00:47:23.889 --> 00:47:28.889
So the effect in my opinion on
wildlife and fish,

00:47:28.889 --> 00:47:31.039
on noise, on esthetics and
vibration,

00:47:31.039 --> 00:47:35.849
on the shadow and flicker
effects that are being studied,

00:47:35.849 --> 00:47:38.184
along with the vibration
effects right here in the Yale

00:47:38.184 --> 00:47:38.920
Medical School.
 

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.300
There is a claim,
by the way, that these wind

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:47.141
turbine farms create vibrations
that you can't actually feel but

00:47:47.141 --> 00:47:51.751
they're strong enough if you are
in close enough proximity to

00:47:51.751 --> 00:47:55.440
these fields to have your sleep
disturbed.

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.960
And also on property values and
on recreational access,

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.699
these are the core points of
contention.

00:48:01.699 --> 00:48:05.047
But compared to managing
nuclear waste over hundreds of

00:48:05.047 --> 00:48:07.835
thousands of years,
these seem like relatively

00:48:07.835 --> 00:48:08.889
minor issues.
 

00:48:08.889 --> 00:48:11.230
And I'd like to close with just
one thought,

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:15.289
and that is as you think about
difficult tradeoffs such as

00:48:15.289 --> 00:48:18.253
this,
I encourage you to consider the

00:48:18.253 --> 00:48:20.030
idea of reversibility.
 

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:24.369
Reversibility is a concept that
has been built into a variety of

00:48:24.369 --> 00:48:25.539
different laws.
 

00:48:25.539 --> 00:48:29.478
So that under many different
statutes, the government is

00:48:29.478 --> 00:48:33.989
required to consider whether or
not the effect is reversible.

00:48:33.989 --> 00:48:39.074
So plutonium,
the creation of plutonium is

00:48:39.074 --> 00:48:44.655
not a reversible decision,
given the length of

00:48:44.655 --> 00:48:46.639
persistence.
 

00:48:46.639 --> 00:48:50.213
The construction of a
coal-fired power plant such as

00:48:50.213 --> 00:48:54.280
you see here in the upper left,
yeah, that's reversible.

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:55.829
You could pull that apart.
 

00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:58.905
But if we look at our history
of rehabilitation of damaged

00:48:58.905 --> 00:49:01.550
sites and industrial facilities
in the nation,

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:04.079
they tend not to be rebuilt
because they're so highly

00:49:04.079 --> 00:49:04.809
contaminated.
 

00:49:04.809 --> 00:49:08.963
Think about the disassembly of
a turbine farm or the

00:49:08.963 --> 00:49:13.362
disassembly of a solar
generating facility such as this

00:49:13.362 --> 00:49:16.050
out in the New Mexico desert.
 

00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:18.469
These are easily disassembled.
 

00:49:18.469 --> 00:49:23.018
So just consider the idea of
reversibility as you think about

00:49:23.018 --> 00:49:26.280
how these kinds of choices might
be made.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.389
Okay.
 

00:49:27.389 --> 00:49:29.545
Well, that is the end of
lecture twenty-three,

00:49:29.545 --> 00:49:31.940
and we'll wrap with a final
lecture on Thursday.

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:32.659
Thank you.
 

00:49:32.659 --> 00:49:38.000

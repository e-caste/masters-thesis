00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.180
Prof: So back to
business.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.580
We're in a really great
position here because we've gone

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.980
from one dimension to three
dimensions, to get something

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.740
real, a real atom.
 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.780
And if you take that table from
last time,

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.120
that we got from the old-time
mathematicians,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.200
and plug in according to what
you can use together,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.790
you get the exact wave function
that's a solution of the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.120
Schrödinger equation for
the hydrogen atom,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.920
or any atom that has only one
electron.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.080
It can have any nuclear charge
you want, right?

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.020
So it's the real thing.
 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.375
People have shown you pictures,
which are some kinds of

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.534
approximations of this,
but you have the equation,

00:00:44.534 --> 00:00:47.820
the actual formula,
for the true wave function,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.450
and no one has a better one
than you have.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.000
That's the real McCoy.
 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.830
Okay?
 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.993
And you can check these
pictures that people have drawn

00:00:56.993 --> 00:00:59.220
to see if they're realistic
graphs,

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.820
or whether they're just some
kind of artist's impression,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.060
or somebody who doesn't know
anything's impression;

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.046
maybe he's not even an artist.
 

00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:07.510
Right?
 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.819
So you can actually do these.
 

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:13.528
And many of them are very
simple functions,

00:01:13.528 --> 00:01:16.000
like e^(-r),
right?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.810
You can hardly get easier than
that.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.379
Okay, but you can also draw
pictures that look just like

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:24.950
what you could see if the
electron had a color to it.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.080
They're done by ray tracing
where the computer pretends it's

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.140
your eye and sees how much
density it would go through,

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.080
if it went through this point
or that point or that point,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.340
along a certain ray from your
eye, and puts a color here

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.840
that's proportional to how much
electron density it sees.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.515
It's not the wave function;
it's the square of the wave

00:01:44.515 --> 00:01:47.181
function, the electron density,
that Atom-in-a-Box

00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:47.610
plots.
 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.700
Okay?
 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.650
So that's what it would really
look like,

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.265
if you could see it and if
there weren't problems with

00:01:54.265 --> 00:01:58.562
wavelength and photons knocking
electrons to kingdom come and so

00:01:58.562 --> 00:01:59.040
on.
 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.849
That's what it would look like,
right?

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:04.296
But it'll be colored;
it'll be colored according to

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:06.049
the sign the wave function has.
 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.941
It's not the wave function;
it's the square of the wave

00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:08.240
function.
 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.908
So it would be positive.
 

00:02:09.908 --> 00:02:12.610
But it's colored to say the
wave function in this region

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.919
would be positive or in this
region negative.

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:18.048
And I'll show it to you in just
a second, but first let's -- or

00:02:18.048 --> 00:02:20.419
a few minutes -- but first let's
describe it.

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:24.145
So there's lots of information
on the screen that you get with

00:02:24.145 --> 00:02:25.550
Atom-in-a-Box.
 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.490
How many of you have tried it?
 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.689
Okay, all of you should.
 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:31.770
Okay?
 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.990
Okay, first you have the
Schrödinger equation.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.902
That always appears and it's
sort of silly but if you need

00:02:36.902 --> 00:02:39.102
the Schrödinger equation
for reference,

00:02:39.102 --> 00:02:39.919
there it is.
 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:44.562
Then up at the top is the
particular function that's being

00:02:44.562 --> 00:02:47.147
plotted,
and it's given as n,

00:02:47.147 --> 00:02:50.297
l and m,
and also the nickname

00:02:50.297 --> 00:02:53.199
1s, for this particular
one,

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:57.150
which is 1,0,0 for n,
l and m.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.406
And then there's the formula
that that particular wave

00:03:00.406 --> 00:03:02.566
function has,
and you know what it is,

00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:06.144
it's a bunch of constants,
which we can forget,

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:08.788
but it's e^(-r).
 

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:10.818
He's not using Ï 
here, notice.

00:03:10.818 --> 00:03:15.596
He uses actual r and
puts in explicitly the Z

00:03:15.596 --> 00:03:20.289
and the a_o,
and the two is cancelled.

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.990
Okay?
 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.431
And then he says what the
energy would be,

00:03:23.431 --> 00:03:25.158
in units of electron volts.
 

00:03:25.158 --> 00:03:28.961
An electron volt is 23.06 times
as big as a kilocalorie,

00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:31.378
which is what we usually talk
in.

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:35.407
Now, you can look at these
pictures and ask questions,

00:03:35.407 --> 00:03:39.589
some fairly simple questions,
like where is the electron

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:41.110
density highest?
 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.211
The nucleus is in the center of
this picture,

00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:44.120
not surprisingly.
 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.810
So this is not a hard question.
 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.650
Where's the electron density
highest?

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.990
Prof: In the middle,
right?

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.289
No big surprise there.
 

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:54.160
Okay, how do you know?
 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.615
You take the wave function,
you square it and find out

00:03:57.615 --> 00:04:01.340
where it has a maximum,
and e^(-distance) has a

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.710
maximum when the distance is
zero;

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.219
the value is one.
 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:06.688
It falls off from there.
 

00:04:06.688 --> 00:04:09.441
Okay, so you just,
to find where the density is

00:04:09.441 --> 00:04:13.090
highest, you just square the
wave function and maximize it.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.007
Okay, now but here's a slightly
different question:

00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:21.449
What is the most likely
distance?

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.860
Can you see why that's a
different question than where --

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.894
you might think the most likely
distance is wherever the density

00:04:27.894 --> 00:04:30.069
is highest,
but that's not quite true.

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:30.959
Do you see why?
 

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:40.339
Student: 
&gt;

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:41.529
Prof: Because what's
most-- yes?

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:43.709
Student:  It could be
moving very quickly in the area.

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:44.632
Prof: No,
it doesn't have to do with

00:04:44.632 --> 00:04:44.829
motion.
 

00:04:44.829 --> 00:04:45.569
Yes Lucas?
 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:47.490
Student:  There's almost
no volume in the center.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.040
Prof: There's almost no
volume in the center.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.519
If you take--say if you talk
about a point,

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:56.170
then there's no volume at all.
 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.480
Okay?
 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.629
But take a little box and put
it in the center,

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:02.528
or actually a sphere of a
certain radius,

00:05:02.528 --> 00:05:05.720
a small radius,
0.0001 Å

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.305
say,
and put it in the center,

00:05:08.305 --> 00:05:10.920
and see how much density is
inside.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.500
Okay?
 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.153
But then you could look at one
angstrom out,

00:05:15.153 --> 00:05:19.915
and now you're looking at a
little spherical shell that's

00:05:19.915 --> 00:05:22.040
0.0001 Å
thick.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.209
Is everybody clear?
 

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:26.574
So there could be different
directions in which you have

00:05:26.574 --> 00:05:29.574
this electron density,
which is at that particular

00:05:29.574 --> 00:05:31.410
distance from the nucleus.
 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:37.459
And the further out you go,
the more volume this shell has.

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:41.339
It's always the same thickness,
but as you move out there's

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:42.610
more stuff in it.
 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:43.769
You see what I mean?
 

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:45.430
More volume in it.
 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.259
What's it proportional to?
 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:50.050
As you increase r,
how does the volume of the

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.980
shell increase?
 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.079
How does the surface of the
sphere increase as you go out?

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:55.160
Student:  r^(3).
 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.089
Prof: No,
volume is r^(3).

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:58.100
Student:  r^(2).
 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.170
Prof: It goes with
r^(2).

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.007
The surface goes with
r^(2).

00:06:01.007 --> 00:06:01.439
Right?
 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:06.750
So you have to multiply the
probability density by

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.410
r^(2),
to see at what radius you have

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.470
the most stuff.
 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.480
Is that clear to everyone?
 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.653
Because you want to count
everything that's at that

00:06:18.653 --> 00:06:19.776
radius,
not only in that direction but

00:06:19.776 --> 00:06:21.452
also in that direction,
that direction,

00:06:21.452 --> 00:06:23.509
that direction,
and so on,

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:25.839
and the sphere gets bigger as
you go out.

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:30.858
So you'll notice that what's
given in this plot here on the

00:06:30.858 --> 00:06:36.310
bottom right is r^(2)
times the wave function squared.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.040
Okay?
 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:43.250
So that'll tell you what's the
most likely distance.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.110
Okay?
 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.370
So you have to do surface
weighting by r^(2),

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.654
and it's not at zero,
it's at the unit that we use to

00:06:51.654 --> 00:06:55.586
measure distance in,
a_0, which turns out to

00:06:55.586 --> 00:07:00.009
be half an angstrom,
0.53 Å.

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:03.829
Okay, now here's a 2s
orbital.

00:07:03.829 --> 00:07:04.680
Right?
 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:10.471
Here we'll draw two different
shells of the same thickness,

00:07:10.471 --> 00:07:11.269
right?
 

00:07:11.269 --> 00:07:15.016
We'll number them one and two,
and we're going to ask the

00:07:15.016 --> 00:07:17.759
question, which one has higher
density?

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:29.339
&lt;&lt;Technical adjustments
of room lighting&gt;&gt;

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:32.269
Okay, which shell has higher
density, one or two?

00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:32.920
Student:  One.
 

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.639
Prof: One, clearly, okay?
 

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:38.839
Now, here's a different
question -- okay,

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:43.480
it shows one -- which shell
contains more electron density,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.680
more stuff?
 

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.829
Which one has more probability?
 

00:07:46.829 --> 00:07:47.720
Students:  Two.
 

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.103
Prof: It's not obvious,
because one has higher density

00:07:52.103 --> 00:07:53.930
but two is much bigger.
 

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:54.810
Okay?
 

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:59.964
And in fact,
the two has about three times

00:07:59.964 --> 00:08:02.228
the radius of one.
 

00:08:02.228 --> 00:08:03.360
Right?
 

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.120
So how much more volume does
that shell have?

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.329
Student:  Nine times.
 

00:08:08.329 --> 00:08:10.240
Prof: About nine times
more volume;

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.660
not of the sphere but of the
shell.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.910
Okay?
 

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.930
So it's about nine times the
volume.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.427
So it turns out that actually
two has more stuff,

00:08:19.427 --> 00:08:21.613
and you see that in this plot.
 

00:08:21.613 --> 00:08:22.269
Right?
 

00:08:22.269 --> 00:08:27.807
The red for two is bigger than
the green for one.

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:28.730
Right?
 

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:33.106
So depending on what question
you ask, you have to decide

00:08:33.106 --> 00:08:37.952
whether you have to weight it by
r^(2) to get the answer

00:08:37.952 --> 00:08:38.970
you need.
 

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.990
Okay, now here's another way of
looking at a wave function.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:49.870
This happens to be the -- it's
actually a 3D wave function;

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.230
as you see, not from here,
but from here,

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:54.070
it's 3D.
 

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.346
This is the picture in three
dimensions, using that ray

00:08:57.346 --> 00:08:59.350
tracing, the way we talk about.
 

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.317
But you can do it,
if you click "Slice"

00:09:02.317 --> 00:09:05.100
down here, then you get a slice
through it.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.340
Okay?
 

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.210
So that's 2-dimensional,
more like the contour plots

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.278
we've been using.
 

00:09:10.278 --> 00:09:12.288
It's just a slice through the
3D thing.

00:09:12.288 --> 00:09:15.140
So this is a 2D,
not a projection,

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.894
but an actual slice of it,
and with this slider here you

00:09:19.894 --> 00:09:22.919
can control where the slice is.
 

00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:25.570
It's in the middle there;
so it goes through the nucleus.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.142
But if you want,
you can slide it down and see

00:09:28.142 --> 00:09:31.629
what the slice would be if it
were in front of the screen that

00:09:31.629 --> 00:09:33.230
you sliced this picture.
 

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:34.750
Everybody got it?
 

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.724
So you can look at different
levels that way,

00:09:36.724 --> 00:09:38.519
if you want to,
or you can pretend you're

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:39.909
looking at the whole thing.
 

00:09:39.909 --> 00:09:42.418
So it can be near or far.
 

00:09:42.418 --> 00:09:48.418
Okay, now let's look at these
two different,

00:09:48.418 --> 00:09:52.027
the 2D and the 3D pictures,
and look at the pattern of

00:09:52.027 --> 00:09:55.081
nodes,
the shape and the energy of the

00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:56.580
3d orbital.
 

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:02.950
You see here that there are
diagonal nodes in this 3d

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.029
orbital.
 

00:10:04.029 --> 00:10:04.980
Okay?
 

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.690
So that's 3d.
 

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:12.990
Let's look at this one.
 

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.139
Now we still have those two
diagonal nodes.

00:10:16.139 --> 00:10:22.178
In fact, it turns out that the
nodes are actually cones.

00:10:22.178 --> 00:10:27.080
This is a slice through a cone,
on the top, and on the bottom.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:27.798
Okay?
 

00:10:27.798 --> 00:10:32.037
So the nodal surface -- bear in
mind that in one dimension a

00:10:32.037 --> 00:10:35.764
node is a point;
in two dimensions a node is a

00:10:35.764 --> 00:10:38.552
line;
in three dimensions a node is a

00:10:38.552 --> 00:10:39.140
surface.
 

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:39.730
Right?
 

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:43.635
So we're slicing it and see an
intersection of the conical

00:10:43.635 --> 00:10:46.788
surface here,
but the actual node is a cone.

00:10:46.788 --> 00:10:50.793
Okay, but is that the only node
that you see in that picture on

00:10:50.793 --> 00:10:51.570
the right?
 

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.110
Student:  There's a
circular--

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.957
Prof: Ah-ha,
Angela says she sees a circle

00:10:55.957 --> 00:10:56.195
too.
 

00:10:56.195 --> 00:10:56.730
Right?
 

00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:00.100
So there are two kinds of nodes
in this orbital.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:05.139
There's both a conical node,
which we had in the previous

00:11:05.139 --> 00:11:07.615
one;
the 3d orbital had a

00:11:07.615 --> 00:11:08.620
conical node.
 

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:12.629
That's what makes it a d
orbital, having a conical node.

00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:15.674
But this one also has a
spherical node,

00:11:15.674 --> 00:11:18.639
which is a circle when we slice
it.

00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:19.918
Okay?
 

00:11:19.918 --> 00:11:24.119
So is this higher energy or
lower energy than the one we

00:11:24.119 --> 00:11:25.570
looked at before?
 

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:26.240
Students:  Higher.
 

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.029
Prof: How do you know
it's higher?

00:11:28.029 --> 00:11:28.509
Student:  Nodes.
 

00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:29.048
Student:  More nodes.
 

00:11:29.048 --> 00:11:30.706
Prof: It has more nodes.
 

00:11:30.706 --> 00:11:33.753
Did you ever see a situation
before where you can have two

00:11:33.753 --> 00:11:35.250
different kinds of nodes?
 

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.335
Here you have both,
in this section,

00:11:39.335 --> 00:11:42.370
both a circle and lines.
 

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.220
You ever see anything like that
before?

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.080
Student:  Chladni plates.
 

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.629
Prof: Right.
 

00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:50.270
Anyhow it's higher energy,
it's 4d,

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.947
not 3d,
as you said,

00:11:51.947 --> 00:11:53.879
and it's like this,
right?

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:56.265
You have both circular and
diameter nodes,

00:11:56.265 --> 00:11:59.525
but this is three-dimensional
so you have both sphere and

00:11:59.525 --> 00:12:00.048
cone.
 

00:12:00.048 --> 00:12:06.460
So can you guess what a
5d orbital would look

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.340
like?
 

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.070
We looked at a 3d
orbital.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.250
This is a 4d orbital.
 

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:11.269
How about a 5d orbital?
 

00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:12.200
Lucas?
 

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.460
Student:  It would have
a third layer of nodes.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.639
Prof: Not a third layer
of nodes.

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:20.509
It would have how many more
nodes?

00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:21.120
Student:  One.
 

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.509
Prof: One more node.
 

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:24.110
Student:  A circle,
a sphere.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.150
Prof: And it would be --
in the section it would be

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:28.702
another circle;
or actually it's another sphere

00:12:28.702 --> 00:12:30.269
of a different diameter.
 

00:12:30.269 --> 00:12:31.570
Okay?
 

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:36.654
So you see how you can combine
cones in this case--or it can be

00:12:36.654 --> 00:12:39.378
planes too;
you have planes for p

00:12:39.378 --> 00:12:45.879
orbitals--
you can combine spheres with

00:12:45.879 --> 00:12:50.976
planes,
or cones, and you can combine

00:12:50.976 --> 00:12:56.190
them in different ways to get
the same energy.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.405
For example,
you can have a sphere and a

00:12:59.405 --> 00:13:03.482
cone that has a certain energy--
that's 4d,

00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:09.049
the one we're looking at here--
or you could have two sets of

00:13:09.049 --> 00:13:13.860
-- forget the sphere but have
another cone.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.750
Does that remind you of
anything?

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.470
And get the same energy.
 

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:24.580
Or you can have a plane and a
cone,

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:29.899
or you could have a sphere and
a plane,

00:13:29.899 --> 00:13:32.668
or you can have a sphere and a
cone --

00:13:32.668 --> 00:13:35.379
I said that already -- or you
could have two spheres,

00:13:35.379 --> 00:13:37.389
or you could have two planes.
 

00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:40.471
All those are two nodes--does
everybody see what I'm

00:13:40.471 --> 00:13:43.129
saying--and they all have the
same energy.

00:13:43.129 --> 00:13:45.048
Does that remind you of
anything?

00:13:45.048 --> 00:13:48.686
It's not exactly the same,
but it should remind you of

00:13:48.686 --> 00:13:49.509
something.
 

00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:52.988
That's what Chladni saw;
remember, you could get

00:13:52.988 --> 00:13:55.085
different combinations,
in his case,

00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:57.960
of circles and lines,
and get the same frequency.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.620
Right?
 

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:03.168
So that's why the 2s and
the 2p have the same

00:14:03.168 --> 00:14:07.248
energy, or the 3s,
the 3p and 3d

00:14:07.248 --> 00:14:09.210
have the same energy.
 

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:16.070
Okay, now let's talk about
scaling -- H-like.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:18.190
What do we mean by H-like?
 

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.720
Student:  One electron.
 

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.044
Prof: It's one electron;
any nuclear charge,

00:14:23.044 --> 00:14:25.220
but one electron.
 

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.019
Why incidentally do we want it
to be one electron?

00:14:28.019 --> 00:14:30.700
Zack?
 

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.658
Student:  Repulsion.
 

00:14:32.658 --> 00:14:34.399
Prof: That will turn out
to be the case,

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:36.933
but even if that weren't the
case, there's a good reason to

00:14:36.933 --> 00:14:38.070
start with one electron.
 

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:39.450
Yeah?
 

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:41.402
Student:  You get a
Coulombic interaction between

00:14:41.402 --> 00:14:41.970
the electrons.
 

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.024
Prof: Yeah,
it's true that we don't want --

00:14:44.024 --> 00:14:46.625
well we'll get into big trouble
when we get Coulomb interaction

00:14:46.625 --> 00:14:47.549
between electrons.
 

00:14:47.549 --> 00:14:48.460
It's absolutely right.
 

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.320
But we want to walk before we
try to run;

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.962
work with three variables,
not six variables,

00:14:53.962 --> 00:14:57.267
which you'd have with two
electrons, or 3n if you

00:14:57.267 --> 00:14:58.649
had n electrons.
 

00:14:58.649 --> 00:14:59.308
Right?
 

00:14:59.308 --> 00:15:01.308
So we want simple functions at
the beginning.

00:15:01.308 --> 00:15:05.111
So that's what an H-like wave
function is, just one electron,

00:15:05.111 --> 00:15:07.327
just three variables;
Ï ,

00:15:07.327 --> 00:15:10.013
Î¸,
Ï† are the convenient

00:15:10.013 --> 00:15:10.480
ones.
 

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.589
Okay, but now we want to see
how we scale it as we change the

00:15:13.589 --> 00:15:14.470
nuclear charge.
 

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.136
We already started talking
about that last time when we

00:15:17.136 --> 00:15:21.573
talked about Ï ,
but we're going to talk about

00:15:21.573 --> 00:15:23.894
size,
also about electron density,

00:15:23.894 --> 00:15:26.745
and also about energy and how
the energies of these

00:15:26.745 --> 00:15:30.278
one-electron atoms change as you
change the nuclear charge.

00:15:30.278 --> 00:15:33.379
Okay, this is what we talked
about last time,

00:15:33.379 --> 00:15:36.048
that if you make the table up,
the formulas,

00:15:36.048 --> 00:15:38.418
in Ï ,
instead of in r,

00:15:38.418 --> 00:15:41.610
then you could use it for any
hydrogen-like atom,

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:47.932
because the distance scale gets
multiplied by the nuclear

00:15:47.932 --> 00:15:49.791
charge;
that is to say,

00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:51.808
if you have a given
Ï  --

00:15:51.808 --> 00:15:55.259
that's a given size of the
function we're talking about --

00:15:55.259 --> 00:16:00.644
a given Ï ,
then you have that value at

00:16:00.644 --> 00:16:06.139
shorter r,
if you have a higher Z;

00:16:06.139 --> 00:16:07.350
a tradeoff between Z and
r.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:11.635
If you double Z,
you get the same value at half

00:16:11.635 --> 00:16:12.850
the r.
 

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.700
Does that make sense,
that as you get Z

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.779
bigger, the distances get
smaller?

00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:21.250
Does that make sense?
 

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:22.028
Why?
 

00:16:22.028 --> 00:16:23.639
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:16:23.639 --> 00:16:27.032
Prof: Because the
nucleus pulls the electron in

00:16:27.032 --> 00:16:27.480
more.
 

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.620
And notice that it's linear,
right?

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.239
If you double the nuclear
charge, you shrink by a factor

00:16:33.239 --> 00:16:34.950
of two, in the distance.
 

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.509
Okay?
 

00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:39.089
So increasing Z shrinks
the wave function,

00:16:39.089 --> 00:16:41.830
makes r smaller for the
same Ï ;

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:44.038
that is, the same height of the
wave function,

00:16:44.038 --> 00:16:47.149
or the same position in the
shape of the wave function,

00:16:47.149 --> 00:16:52.168
because you have to renormalize
if you shrink the wave function.

00:16:52.168 --> 00:16:57.335
Okay, so let's compare
hydrogen, carbon^(+6),

00:16:57.335 --> 00:16:59.682
and potassium^(+19).
 

00:16:59.682 --> 00:17:00.740
Right?
 

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:05.119
So the distance scale will go
1,1/6th, 1/19th.

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:07.118
So this is what it looks like.
 

00:17:07.118 --> 00:17:11.763
If a hydrogen atom is that big,
this is how big the carbon

00:17:11.763 --> 00:17:14.872
one-electron atom is,
and that's how big the

00:17:14.872 --> 00:17:20.049
potassium one-electron is,
1/19th as the linear distance

00:17:20.049 --> 00:17:22.608
that's in hydrogen.
 

00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:25.170
Now, how much does the electron
density change?

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:30.076
I think that's the next thing;
yeah, scaling electron density

00:17:30.076 --> 00:17:31.368
with Z.
 

00:17:31.368 --> 00:17:34.950
You can see that just from what
we just talked about.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:40.284
If you shrink the distance by a
factor of two,

00:17:40.284 --> 00:17:44.670
how much do you change the
density?

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:47.933
Factor of two,
does the density get twice as

00:17:47.933 --> 00:17:51.349
high if you make the distance
half as long?

00:17:51.349 --> 00:17:53.109
Ryan?
 

00:17:53.109 --> 00:17:54.130
Student:  2^(3).
 

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:56.346
Prof: It's got to be
2^(3), because you shrink it

00:17:56.346 --> 00:17:58.038
this way and this way and also
this way.

00:17:58.038 --> 00:18:00.195
So it goes up with
Z^(3),

00:18:00.195 --> 00:18:01.170
the density.
 

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.440
That means if you have a
hydrogen atom,

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.288
the electrons are every
which-a-way,

00:18:05.288 --> 00:18:08.750
all over, but if you have even
a carbon atom,

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:12.509
six times the nuclear charge
for the same 1s orbital,

00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:17.519
the density is 6^(3) as big.
 

00:18:17.519 --> 00:18:18.538
What's 6^(3)?
 

00:18:18.538 --> 00:18:21.588
Thirty-six -- ~fourty five --
over 200, right?

00:18:21.588 --> 00:18:24.329
So you have 200 times the
electron density for the

00:18:24.329 --> 00:18:27.351
1s electron in carbon,
compared to the 1s

00:18:27.351 --> 00:18:28.750
electron in hydrogen.
 

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:32.680
Where does that crop up in
experiment --

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:36.943
that you have so much higher
electron density for carbon than

00:18:36.943 --> 00:18:39.901
you do for hydrogen --
and other things are even more

00:18:39.901 --> 00:18:41.914
so,
like potassium -- where does it

00:18:41.914 --> 00:18:42.440
crop up?
 

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:42.890
Yeah?
 

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:43.900
Student:  The contour
plots.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:44.420
Prof: Of what?
 

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.779
Student:  Of the
molecules, the bond lengths.

00:18:46.779 --> 00:18:47.910
Prof: What experiment?
 

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:48.720
Student:  I forget.
 

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.670
Prof: Close.
 

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.470
What?
 

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:52.269
Student:  I forget.
 

00:18:52.269 --> 00:18:53.970
Prof: You can do it by
calculation and you'd see much

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:54.460
higher density.
 

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:58.299
That's what we're talking about
is theory, but where do you see

00:18:58.299 --> 00:18:59.539
it experimentally?
 

00:18:59.539 --> 00:19:00.078
Lucas?
 

00:19:00.078 --> 00:19:01.750
Student:  Refraction
difference diagrams.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.086
Prof: Not to do --
well you can do it in the

00:19:03.086 --> 00:19:05.276
difference,
but if you look at the total

00:19:05.276 --> 00:19:08.019
electron density you don't see
hydrogens,

00:19:08.019 --> 00:19:10.920
unless you look -- work --
really hard,

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.417
because the density of
electrons, which is what you're

00:19:13.417 --> 00:19:16.470
seeing,
is so much higher for other

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.140
atoms.
 

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:21.038
Okay, so the normalization has
to be one.

00:19:21.038 --> 00:19:24.028
So if you shrink it,
and that's where that comes in.

00:19:24.028 --> 00:19:27.434
We talked about that
Z/a_o to the

00:19:27.434 --> 00:19:30.818
3/2 that gets squared before,
and so that the

00:19:30.818 --> 00:19:34.759
Î¨^(2) is proportional
to Z^(3),

00:19:34.759 --> 00:19:37.730
and the density of the
1s electron,

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:42.559
as you go across these atoms,
goes from one to 216 to 7000;

00:19:42.559 --> 00:19:45.078
potassium is 7000 times higher.
 

00:19:45.078 --> 00:19:49.898
Remember where we saw that in
X-ray, what a very dark atom

00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:50.828
that was.
 

00:19:50.828 --> 00:19:55.900
Okay, so it helps X-rays find
heavier atoms more easily.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.140
Now how about the kinetic
energy?

00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:58.700
Right?
 

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:03.646
So Î¨ is a function
of r, some kind of

00:20:03.646 --> 00:20:08.318
function of r,
but it includes a Z;

00:20:08.318 --> 00:20:11.473
Z times r,
because Ï  is

00:20:11.473 --> 00:20:13.220
Z times r.
 

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:18.117
So now, how does that influence
the derivative,

00:20:18.117 --> 00:20:18.970
right?
 

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:23.009
If you have a function of
Zr, the derivative of it

00:20:23.009 --> 00:20:26.977
is Z times the function of Z,
by the derivative of -- oh

00:20:26.977 --> 00:20:30.230
what's it?;
blah-blah.

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:33.940
I got that wrong,
or do I have it right?

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:34.568
Student:  That's right.
 

00:20:34.568 --> 00:20:36.220
Prof: That's right,
yeah I got it right.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:37.859
Okay, now about how about the
second derivative?

00:20:37.859 --> 00:20:39.348
Student:  Z^(2).
 

00:20:39.348 --> 00:20:42.279
Prof: It's going to have
a Z^(2 )in it,

00:20:42.279 --> 00:20:42.730
right?
 

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:48.288
So the curvature is going to be
Z^(2 )times what the

00:20:48.288 --> 00:20:51.958
curvature was before,
but the value of the wave

00:20:51.958 --> 00:20:55.970
function is the same at some --
the corresponding Ï .

00:20:55.970 --> 00:21:00.900
So what's going to happen to
the kinetic energy?

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.731
If you have a bigger nuclear
charge, what's going to happen

00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:06.661
to the kinetic energy at any
point, at a corresponding point?

00:21:06.661 --> 00:21:07.150
Right?
 

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.670
It's going to be proportional
to Z^(2),

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.750
the curvature divided by the
value of the wave function.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:13.308
Right?
 

00:21:13.308 --> 00:21:17.023
So the kinetic energy is going
to really zoom up for a

00:21:17.023 --> 00:21:20.318
hydrogen-like atom,
when you get a heavier atom.

00:21:20.318 --> 00:21:21.019
Right?
 

00:21:21.019 --> 00:21:23.558
So let's summarize what we did
so far.

00:21:23.558 --> 00:21:27.750
So distance will shrink
according to Z,

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:31.019
electron density will go up
according to Z^(3),

00:21:31.019 --> 00:21:34.480
and the kinetic energy will go
with Z^(2).

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.410
Okay?
 

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:40.203
Now how about the potential
energy, how will it change as we

00:21:40.203 --> 00:21:42.480
change the nuclear charge?
 

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.578
Well if we change the nuclear
charge;

00:21:44.578 --> 00:21:48.144
Coulomb's law includes the
nuclear charge,

00:21:48.144 --> 00:21:48.838
right?
 

00:21:48.838 --> 00:21:56.347
So at the same distance you'll
have Z times whatever it

00:21:56.347 --> 00:21:59.777
was for hydrogen,
much higher,

00:21:59.777 --> 00:22:02.598
or indeed lower potential
energy,

00:22:02.598 --> 00:22:06.058
more negative,
further from zero.

00:22:06.058 --> 00:22:10.803
Okay, but at a fixed-- that's--
so at a fixed distance the

00:22:10.803 --> 00:22:15.130
potential energy will be
proportional to Z;

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:19.538
but the distance shrinks, right?
 

00:22:19.538 --> 00:22:22.700
So if you look at corresponding
positions in the wave function,

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:26.358
or you look at the average
potential energy,

00:22:26.358 --> 00:22:29.480
it's going to go-- it's going
to also be,

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.618
take into account that the
distance gets smaller,

00:22:32.618 --> 00:22:36.318
r gets smaller,
because the thing got shrunken

00:22:36.318 --> 00:22:38.170
by a factor of Z.
 

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:42.140
So what happens to the average
potential energy?

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:44.339
How does it it scale with
Z?

00:22:44.339 --> 00:22:47.130
Maria, you got an idea?
 

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:50.490
At a given distance,
the energy, according to

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.209
Coulomb's law,
will be multiplied by Z,

00:22:53.209 --> 00:22:55.269
because you've got a bigger
nuclear charge,

00:22:55.269 --> 00:23:01.269
but every distance gets shrunk
by a factor of Z.

00:23:01.269 --> 00:23:02.160
Right?
 

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:06.740
So if you average everything,
what are you going to get?

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.486
There are two factors of
Z that are increasing (or

00:23:10.486 --> 00:23:13.497
decreasing, making more
favorable) the energy,

00:23:13.497 --> 00:23:15.170
the potential energy.
 

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.650
Got that?
 

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:18.319
Two factors.
 

00:23:18.319 --> 00:23:19.809
So what's it going to be?
 

00:23:19.809 --> 00:23:21.858
Student:  Z^(2).
 

00:23:21.858 --> 00:23:25.338
Prof: Z^(2),
right?

00:23:25.338 --> 00:23:30.890
So the potential energy--what
did the kinetic energy go with?

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:35.339
Remember how the kinetic energy
scaled?

00:23:35.339 --> 00:23:36.950
Student:  Z^(2).
 

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:37.608
Prof: Z^(2).
 

00:23:37.608 --> 00:23:40.509
How does the potential energy
scale?

00:23:40.509 --> 00:23:42.460
Student:  Z^(2).
 

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.435
Prof: How about the
average potential energy,

00:23:46.435 --> 00:23:49.009
if I double the nuclear charge?
 

00:23:49.009 --> 00:23:51.526
How much lower is the --
obviously if I increase the

00:23:51.526 --> 00:23:53.336
charge,
the average energy of the

00:23:53.336 --> 00:23:56.401
electrons is going to get lower,
but for two reasons,

00:23:56.401 --> 00:23:58.880
because the nuclear charge is
bigger,

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.569
and because the electron is
twice as close.

00:24:02.569 --> 00:24:03.700
Okay?
 

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.500
So how does it scale,
the potential energy average?

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.640
 Z^(2).
 

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.796
So the kinetic energy scales
with Z^(2),

00:24:11.796 --> 00:24:15.089
the potential energy scales
with Z^(2).

00:24:15.089 --> 00:24:16.279
How about the total energy?
 

00:24:16.279 --> 00:24:17.630
This is a hard one.
 

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:20.432
Student:  Z^(2).
Prof:  Z^(2),

00:24:20.432 --> 00:24:21.038
right?
 

00:24:21.038 --> 00:24:24.444
Okay, so the potential energy
goes as Z^(2),

00:24:24.444 --> 00:24:27.374
and the total energy,
here's a big surprise,

00:24:27.374 --> 00:24:29.690
it goes with Z^(2) too.
 

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:33.605
It also happens to be
1/(n^(2)).

00:24:33.605 --> 00:24:34.430
Right?
 

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:41.068
So the energy gets -- yeah,
so as you go up in n,

00:24:41.068 --> 00:24:44.568
you get less stable,
right?

00:24:44.568 --> 00:24:47.750
Now R turns out to be
about 300 kilocalories/mole,

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:50.588
if you want to really get what
the energies are.

00:24:50.588 --> 00:24:52.519
And here is a plot of the
energies.

00:24:52.519 --> 00:24:56.038
Here's the 1s,
2s or 2p,

00:24:56.038 --> 00:24:59.720
3s or 3p or
3d, 4s,

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.759
p, d,
f and so on,

00:25:02.759 --> 00:25:03.720
right?
 

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.568
But the distance from zero,
the amount of stabilization,

00:25:07.568 --> 00:25:10.230
is proportional to
1/(n^(2));

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:16.056
and we saw the same thing if we
did-- in the one-dimensional

00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:19.215
Coulomb case,
the energy was also

00:25:19.215 --> 00:25:21.289
1/(n^(2)).
 

00:25:21.289 --> 00:25:23.710
Okay.
 

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:28.180
Notice it's independent of
l and m;

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:31.098
3s is the same as
3p is the same as

00:25:31.098 --> 00:25:31.828
3d.
 

00:25:31.828 --> 00:25:35.759
Does that square with what you
have learned before?

00:25:35.759 --> 00:25:36.298
Student:  No.
 

00:25:36.298 --> 00:25:41.750
Prof: What did you learn
before?

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.242
Lexy, did you learn anything
about that before,

00:25:44.242 --> 00:25:46.519
about the energies of
3s, 3p,

00:25:46.519 --> 00:25:47.279
3d?
 

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:49.039
No.
 

00:25:49.039 --> 00:25:55.099
Anybody?
 

00:25:55.099 --> 00:25:58.640
Shai?
 

00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.930
Student:  s,
p, d.

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.532
Prof: Yes,
s is lower than p

00:26:02.532 --> 00:26:03.890
is lower than d.
 

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:08.084
Now how can both these things
be true, that you heard

00:26:08.084 --> 00:26:12.520
something that was true,
and I'm telling you they're all

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.568
the same?
 

00:26:13.568 --> 00:26:19.140
Student:  There are more
electrons.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.660
Prof: Ah-ha!
 

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:24.996
What you heard about was real
atoms, things that have many

00:26:24.996 --> 00:26:25.910
electrons.
 

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:29.130
I'm telling you about if the
atom has only one electron,

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:32.349
then s and p and
d are the same.

00:26:32.349 --> 00:26:32.818
Okay?
 

00:26:32.818 --> 00:26:35.970
But it'll be different when you
have many electrons,

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:37.700
and we'll see why shortly.
 

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.798
Okay, because this is
one-electron atoms.

00:26:40.798 --> 00:26:43.380
Okay, so we've -- this just
summarizes --

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.077
the size goes with 1/Z,
the electron density is

00:26:47.077 --> 00:26:50.343
proportional to Z^(3),
and the energy goes with

00:26:50.343 --> 00:26:53.078
Z^(2),
whether you're talking

00:26:53.078 --> 00:26:56.500
potential, kinetic or total
energy.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:02.500
Okay, and it's also
1/n^(2).

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:07.009
And the size happens to be
n/Z as well.

00:27:07.009 --> 00:27:10.795
Okay, now here's a really
pretty one, and to do this,

00:27:10.795 --> 00:27:14.578
to see this right,
you want to see the real thing.

00:27:14.578 --> 00:27:17.970
So notice that this is a
2p orbital;

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:20.559
n, l,
m are 2,1,1.

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:22.308
Everybody see that?
 

00:27:22.308 --> 00:27:25.220
I want to show you the real
program that does that.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:30.566
&lt;&lt;Technical adjustments
to show 3d orbital in

00:27:30.566 --> 00:27:34.130
Atom-in-a-Box
program&gt;&gt;

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:39.656
Okay, now what I want for the
display -- this display is just

00:27:39.656 --> 00:27:43.250
as if electrons were all white,
okay?

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:47.557
But we want to color them
according to the color of the --

00:27:47.557 --> 00:27:51.186
&lt;&lt;Technical Adjustments of
Atom-in-a-Box

00:27:51.186 --> 00:27:52.848
format&gt;&gt;
 

00:27:52.848 --> 00:28:04.083
-- we want to color them with
the phase, plus,

00:28:04.083 --> 00:28:06.079
minus.
 

00:28:06.079 --> 00:28:07.960
That's 3d.
 

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.960
The phase keeps changing.
 

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:14.519
That has to do with time
dependence, which we're not

00:28:14.519 --> 00:28:15.950
talking about.
 

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:16.630
Okay?
 

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:19.338
Now, that's a 3d orbital.
 

00:28:19.338 --> 00:28:21.289
We want to have -- what did we
have before?

00:28:21.289 --> 00:28:22.910
We had 2p, right?
 

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:24.828
So I'll make this instead of a
three, a two.

00:28:24.828 --> 00:28:31.117
So there's a 2p orbital,
a particular 2p orbital,

00:28:31.117 --> 00:28:31.930
2,1,0.
 

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:34.118
Which one is that?
 

00:28:34.118 --> 00:28:36.874
Notice you have a coordinate
system next door there,

00:28:36.874 --> 00:28:40.059
and I can rotate this thing,
I can grab it and rotate it;

00:28:40.059 --> 00:28:41.480
the coordinate system rotates.
 

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.329
See that?
 

00:28:42.329 --> 00:28:43.578
Student: Cool!
 

00:28:43.578 --> 00:28:46.046
Prof: So I can look at
it end-on if I want to,

00:28:46.046 --> 00:28:47.470
or look at it from the side.
 

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:48.868
Which p orbital is that?
 

00:28:48.868 --> 00:28:49.799
Students:
2p_z.

00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:51.980
Prof: How do you know?
 

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.650
Prof: Points along the
z axis.

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:54.318
Okay?
 

00:28:54.318 --> 00:28:57.482
Now, let's look at another
2p orbital,

00:28:57.482 --> 00:29:01.150
because we can make m
one instead of zero.

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:04.259
So the 2,1,0 is
2p_z.

00:29:04.259 --> 00:29:10.390
Now what's 2,1,1?
 

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:14.440
Let me look at it this way.
 

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.190
That's time-dependence,
right, and that's weird.

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:22.654
And physicists love this sort
of thing, because they deal with

00:29:22.654 --> 00:29:26.776
atoms in isolation,
and atoms in isolation have

00:29:26.776 --> 00:29:30.538
angular momentum,
things going around.

00:29:30.538 --> 00:29:32.650
But atoms, when they're in
molecules,

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:36.645
when they're with other atoms,
or in other things that distort

00:29:36.645 --> 00:29:38.951
it,
like in an electric field,

00:29:38.951 --> 00:29:41.009
they don't behave that way.
 

00:29:41.009 --> 00:29:45.078
So chemists use a different way
of doing it, right?

00:29:45.078 --> 00:29:48.838
It's not that physicists are
right and chemists are wrong,

00:29:48.838 --> 00:29:51.769
or that chemists are right and
physicists are wrong,

00:29:51.769 --> 00:29:53.799
it's if you're dealing with
isolated atoms,

00:29:53.799 --> 00:29:56.622
you use one thing;
if you're dealing with atoms

00:29:56.622 --> 00:29:59.818
interacting with other atoms you
should use something else.

00:29:59.818 --> 00:30:02.923
And the way you do this,
dealing with something else --

00:30:02.923 --> 00:30:04.130
I'll show you here.
 

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:07.650
You do what's called
superposition;

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:14.460
that is, you add two functions
in order to get a new function,

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.630
and the two functions I'm going
to add,

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:18.339
when I click
"Superposition"

00:30:18.339 --> 00:30:23.615
here,
are 2,1,1, and the other one

00:30:23.615 --> 00:30:28.519
I'm going to use is 2,1,-1.
 

00:30:28.519 --> 00:30:31.098
And now what's that?
 

00:30:31.098 --> 00:30:32.160
Students:
 2p_y.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.118
Prof: That's the
2p_y orbital.

00:30:35.118 --> 00:30:37.230
Okay, does everybody see what I
did?

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:40.964
So I can combine two of the
physicist's orbitals to get the

00:30:40.964 --> 00:30:43.670
chemist's 2p_y
orbital.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:45.151
Dean Dauger,
who wrote this,

00:30:45.151 --> 00:30:47.182
is a physicist,
so he writes physicist

00:30:47.182 --> 00:30:48.279
programs, right?
 

00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:51.750
But we can trick it to be
chemistry by adding two of his

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.960
together, or by subtracting
them;

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:57.682
and when you subtract them you
have to put an i in --

00:30:57.682 --> 00:30:58.440
imaginary.
 

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.210
So I'm not going to do it right
now.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:01.009
You can do it yourself.
 

00:31:01.009 --> 00:31:04.038
You can see down here,
you can do the phase and so on;

00:31:04.038 --> 00:31:07.650
the phase of p makes it
imaginary.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:09.390
I won't do that now.
 

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:13.828
We'll go back to the PowerPoint.
 

00:31:13.828 --> 00:31:29.640
&lt;&lt;Technical Adjustment to
change program&gt;&gt;

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.415
So superposition of that kind,
when you add two functions

00:31:33.415 --> 00:31:37.026
together to get a new function,
for whatever purpose,

00:31:37.026 --> 00:31:39.660
is a kind of what's called
hybridization.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.925
Now there are other kinds of --
have you heard about hybrid

00:31:42.925 --> 00:31:43.432
orbitals?
 

00:31:43.432 --> 00:31:43.940
Right.
 

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.892
What that is is adding two
orbitals together to get a new

00:31:46.892 --> 00:31:47.420
orbital.
 

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:49.858
And let's look about when that
would be.

00:31:49.858 --> 00:31:52.523
As we said, this is the
physicist's 2p,

00:31:52.523 --> 00:31:54.951
m=1, with orbital
angular momentum,

00:31:54.951 --> 00:31:57.318
and it has complex numbers
involved.

00:31:57.318 --> 00:32:00.859
And the chemist's 2p is
that sum.

00:32:00.859 --> 00:32:01.578
Okay.
 

00:32:01.578 --> 00:32:04.528
Now multiplying and adding wave
functions.

00:32:04.528 --> 00:32:08.769
We've already seen a case where
you multiply functions.

00:32:08.769 --> 00:32:12.230
Do you remember where we've
seen things be multiplied?

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:16.250
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:17.259
Prof: Alison,
do you remember?

00:32:17.259 --> 00:32:18.088
No.
 

00:32:18.088 --> 00:32:20.880
Student:  You multiplied
the wave functions.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.608
Prof: Multiplied which
wave functions?

00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:26.498
Let me tell you one place we
already multiplied was squaring

00:32:26.498 --> 00:32:28.895
a wave function is a kind of
multiplication to get

00:32:28.895 --> 00:32:29.680
probability.
 

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.118
But I want a different one.
 

00:32:31.118 --> 00:32:33.890
Student:  When we,
for different variables --

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:35.978
Prof: Ah,
for separating the variables,

00:32:35.978 --> 00:32:38.019
r, Î¸ and
Ï†;

00:32:38.019 --> 00:32:39.650
we had an R function,
a Î˜ function,

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:42.713
a Î¦ function,
and we multiplied these pieces

00:32:42.713 --> 00:32:46.118
together to get the total wave
function for the electron,

00:32:46.118 --> 00:32:47.558
the three-dimensional wave
function.

00:32:47.558 --> 00:32:51.413
So that's one place you
multiply, to get a one-electron

00:32:51.413 --> 00:32:54.838
wave function,
which is -- we call an orbital.

00:32:54.838 --> 00:32:59.079
An orbital is a one-electron
wave function;

00:32:59.079 --> 00:33:00.818
that's what an orbital is.
 

00:33:00.818 --> 00:33:06.440
Now, you can add orbitals to
create a hybrid orbital;

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.982
that's what we just did,
we took two physicist's

00:33:09.982 --> 00:33:14.130
orbitals, added them together,
and got a new orbital.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:15.470
Okay?
 

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:19.650
2p_y +
2p_z is a

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:20.920
hybrid orbital.
 

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.609
An orbital is a one-electron
wave function.

00:33:23.609 --> 00:33:26.890
What's it a function of?
 

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:29.990
What variables do you put in,
in order to get a value out?

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:32.539
How many variables?
 

00:33:32.539 --> 00:33:33.319
Sophie?
 

00:33:33.319 --> 00:33:33.750
Student:  Three.
 

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:34.769
Prof: Three.
 

00:33:34.769 --> 00:33:35.789
What are they?
 

00:33:35.789 --> 00:33:37.390
Student:  Those.
 

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:40.211
Prof: The position of
that electron,

00:33:40.211 --> 00:33:41.490
the one electron.
 

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:45.057
If it's a one-electron orbital,
you can write the orbital as

00:33:45.057 --> 00:33:47.720
many pieces -- here are two
pieces, right?

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.923
But it still is a function of
just the position of one

00:33:50.923 --> 00:33:52.945
electron;
it's not a function of six,

00:33:52.945 --> 00:33:55.538
or eighteen,
or whatever number of

00:33:55.538 --> 00:33:58.960
variables, it's just a function
of --

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.838
it's an orbital,
a one-electron function,

00:34:00.838 --> 00:34:03.650
so it's a position of one
electron that you plug in.

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:08.789
Now, you can change orientation
of orbitals by hybridization.

00:34:08.789 --> 00:34:10.039
Let's look at that.
 

00:34:10.039 --> 00:34:12.610
So here's the 2p_z
orbital.

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:14.577
I've rotated the coordinate
system so z is

00:34:14.577 --> 00:34:15.110
horizontal.
 

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:16.860
Okay?
 

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.543
And here's the 2py_
orbital,

00:34:19.543 --> 00:34:22.896
which we already made by adding
two physicist's orbitals

00:34:22.896 --> 00:34:23.690
together.
 

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:24.429
Okay?
 

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:27.590
Now what happens -- and notice
the 2p_y ,

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:29.719
surprise, is pointed along the
y axis,

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:32.179
2p_z was
pointed along the z axis.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:38.449
What if I add the two together?
 

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:41.360
What if I add 2p_z
and 2p_y?

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.518
Now let's go back and look at
2p_z a second.

00:34:43.518 --> 00:34:45.900
Notice it's red on the left,
blue on the right;

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:49.318
say positive numbers on the
left, negative numbers on the

00:34:49.318 --> 00:34:51.090
right -- everybody with me?
 

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:54.918
-- because it assigns numbers
to different points in space,

00:34:54.918 --> 00:34:58.284
positive numbers on the left,
negative on the right,

00:34:58.284 --> 00:34:59.210
let's say.
 

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:03.297
Now this one assigns positive
numbers on the top,

00:35:03.297 --> 00:35:06.110
negative numbers on the bottom.
 

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:10.920
Suppose I add together,
what am I going to get?

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.090
Andrew?
 

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:13.659
Student:  You get
diagonal.

00:35:13.659 --> 00:35:16.106
Prof: Ah,
they should reinforce in the

00:35:16.106 --> 00:35:18.329
top left where they're both
positive,

00:35:18.329 --> 00:35:21.070
and in the bottom right where
they're both negative,

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:25.179
but in the bottom left and the
top right they should cancel.

00:35:25.179 --> 00:35:26.610
Okay?
 

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:30.463
So if we add them together to
make a weighted sum -- we don't

00:35:30.463 --> 00:35:33.547
have to add them 50:50,
but we'll start by adding

00:35:33.547 --> 00:35:34.190
50:50.
 

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:35.300
Okay?
 

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:40.773
So if we add them,
a 50:50 mixture will give that,

00:35:40.773 --> 00:35:43.119
just what you said.
 

00:35:43.119 --> 00:35:48.322
Okay, so we changed the
orientation of the p

00:35:48.322 --> 00:35:50.820
orbital by adding two.
 

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:56.318
Okay, now suppose we didn't use
50%, suppose we used another

00:35:56.318 --> 00:35:59.860
mixture, suppose we used 75%,
right?

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:04.289
Or there's 50%, or 25%.
 

00:36:04.289 --> 00:36:05.010
Okay?
 

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:10.313
So you can get any orientation
you want by mixing -- within

00:36:10.313 --> 00:36:16.260
that plane, within the yz
plane, by adjusting the ratio.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.039
Okay, there's
2p_y.

00:36:18.039 --> 00:36:24.349
Now, what would happen with a
2s orbital if you put it

00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:26.768
in an electric field?
 

00:36:26.768 --> 00:36:29.480
You're changing the rules,
you're changing the potential,

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:32.940
because now the electron has --
doesn't just --

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.809
its energy doesn't depend just
on its distance from the

00:36:34.809 --> 00:36:37.657
nucleus,
it also depends on where it is

00:36:37.657 --> 00:36:38.809
in the field.
 

00:36:38.809 --> 00:36:44.804
So we're changing the
definition of the potential

00:36:44.804 --> 00:36:45.929
energy.
 

00:36:45.929 --> 00:36:47.880
So it's a different quantum
mechanical problem.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.240
But I don't want you to think
about quantum mechanics,

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.958
I just want you to think about
what would happen if you put an

00:36:52.958 --> 00:36:53.940
electric field on.
 

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.679
What do you think?
 

00:36:55.679 --> 00:36:56.150
Student:  It shouldn't
--

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:58.039
Prof: Would it move the
atom?

00:36:58.039 --> 00:36:58.530
Student:  Yes.
 

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:01.349
Prof: No,
because the atom is neutral,

00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.989
overall.
 

00:37:01.989 --> 00:37:04.070
We'll do a hydrogen atom here.
 

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:05.690
The atom's neutral,
so it won't move.

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:07.059
But what will happen?
 

00:37:07.059 --> 00:37:08.280
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.704
Prof: The electrons will
move one way and the nucleus

00:37:10.704 --> 00:37:14.018
will move the other,
and if you've preserved the

00:37:14.018 --> 00:37:16.768
center of mass,
then the nucleus will hardly

00:37:16.768 --> 00:37:19.186
move at all,
and the electrons will do most

00:37:19.186 --> 00:37:20.079
of the moving.
 

00:37:20.079 --> 00:37:21.300
Okay.
 

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:25.130
So you can change the shape by
hybridization.

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:28.090
We can get something that will
work in an electric field,

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:31.052
describe an atom in an electric
field, by mixing the ones

00:37:31.052 --> 00:37:32.480
without electric field.
 

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.730
Now let's look how we do that.
 

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:37.519
We make an sp^(n) hybrid
orbital.

00:37:37.519 --> 00:37:40.110
Have you ever seen that?;
n is a number.

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:41.750
Can you give me an example?
 

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:44.010
two, sp^(2) or?
 

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:45.010
Student:  sp^(3).
 

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:48.119
Prof: sp^(3) or
sp, where n is

00:37:48.119 --> 00:37:48.829
one, right?
 

00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:50.260
Or sp^(0).
 

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.260
Have you ever seen that?
 

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.980
Student:  No.
 

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.789
Prof: sp^(0) is
just s.

00:37:54.789 --> 00:37:58.719
This is how much p there
is in it, after you square it.

00:37:58.719 --> 00:38:01.829
That is, it's a weighted sum,
this thing you're using.

00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:03.860
You have different values of
a and b,

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:08.849
and it's weighted such that --
so when you square it,

00:38:08.849 --> 00:38:12.086
you get a^(2),
a fraction of 2s

00:38:12.086 --> 00:38:14.876
squared;
that's the distribution

00:38:14.876 --> 00:38:18.168
2s would have;
b^(2) of the way

00:38:18.168 --> 00:38:21.440
p_y would be
when squared.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.951
But you also get a cross-term,
2ab times 2s

00:38:24.951 --> 00:38:26.079
times 2p.
 

00:38:26.079 --> 00:38:29.056
Okay, now so n,
the number you put in to talk

00:38:29.056 --> 00:38:32.019
about sp^(2),
 sp^(3) and so on,

00:38:32.019 --> 00:38:34.420
is the square of
b^(2)/a^(2).

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.489
So if you have an sp
hybrid,

00:38:36.489 --> 00:38:40.639
it means equal parts of
s and p,

00:38:40.639 --> 00:38:44.737
and if you have sp^(3) ,
it means three times as much

00:38:44.737 --> 00:38:48.849
p as s,
after squaring.

00:38:48.849 --> 00:38:51.666
Okay, so it's what fraction you
have of something that looks

00:38:51.666 --> 00:38:54.340
like 2s squared and
2p squared;^( )and then

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:55.630
there's also that part.
 

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:57.860
Okay, so now let's just look at
some examples here.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:02.338
Suppose n is zero;
then you have just pure

00:39:02.338 --> 00:39:03.070
s.
 

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:03.849
Okay?
 

00:39:03.849 --> 00:39:07.882
Now suppose you put an electric
field that wants to shift the

00:39:07.882 --> 00:39:08.690
electrons.
 

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:13.253
It would push a positive charge
to the right but it will push

00:39:13.253 --> 00:39:15.079
electrons to the left.
 

00:39:15.079 --> 00:39:19.896
Okay, so let's -- here we went
to 0.02, just a tiny amount of

00:39:19.896 --> 00:39:20.780
p.
 

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:25.298
But see how it -- here's back
to s, and there's

00:39:25.298 --> 00:39:26.920
sp^(0.02).
 

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.909
It shifted the electrons to the
left.

00:39:28.909 --> 00:39:33.268
What if I go to a higher value?
 

00:39:33.268 --> 00:39:44.909
0.4 0.04,0.06,0.09,0
.11,0.18,0.25,0.33.

00:39:44.909 --> 00:39:48.420
So what I'm doing is turning up
a dial to make the electron --

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:51.440
electric field stronger -- and
the electron is shifting,

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.139
by changing the hybridization.
 

00:39:53.139 --> 00:39:57.760
Okay, 0.5,1.
 

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.719
There's an sp hybrid.
 

00:40:00.719 --> 00:40:04.733
Now what'll happen if I keep on
going, make it sp^(2),

00:40:04.733 --> 00:40:05.670
for example.
 

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:07.619
What do you think will happen?
 

00:40:07.619 --> 00:40:08.480
Guess.
 

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.800
Student:  It'll get more
and more to the right.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.530
Prof: It'll keep going
to the right.

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:13.070
Wrong!
 

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:14.530
Watch this.
 

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:18.579
That's the maximum extension is
sp.

00:40:18.579 --> 00:40:20.690
That's the most you can extend.
 

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:22.699
Now watch what happens if I
make it bigger;

00:40:22.699 --> 00:40:26.563
sp^(2),
sp^(3),

00:40:26.563 --> 00:40:30.427
sp^(4),
sp^(9),

00:40:30.427 --> 00:40:35.119
sp^(24),
pure p.

00:40:35.119 --> 00:40:35.630
Right?
 

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:39.429
Because both pure s and
pure p are symmetrical.

00:40:39.429 --> 00:40:43.873
The 50:50 mixture is the one
that shifts the most to the

00:40:43.873 --> 00:40:44.440
left.
 

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:49.972
Okay, now we're going to close
here with trying to go beyond

00:40:49.972 --> 00:40:52.409
what we've already seen.
 

00:40:52.409 --> 00:40:56.610
What we've seen is one-electron
atoms, hydrogen-like atoms.

00:40:56.610 --> 00:41:00.510
So we find that we can multiply
pieces,

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:01.610
R, Î˜,
Î¦,

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:03.809
to create this one-electron
wave function,

00:41:03.809 --> 00:41:06.239
the orbital,
and we can furthermore add

00:41:06.239 --> 00:41:09.755
these things to make hybrids
that shift things around in

00:41:09.755 --> 00:41:10.780
useful ways.
 

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.346
We can add orbitals to make an
sp hybrid,

00:41:13.346 --> 00:41:15.422
for example,
as what would happen in an

00:41:15.422 --> 00:41:16.460
electric field.
 

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:20.789
But it's still an orbital,
so it allows adjusting to new

00:41:20.789 --> 00:41:22.614
situations --
for example,

00:41:22.614 --> 00:41:25.623
an electric field -- while
preserving the virtues of real

00:41:25.623 --> 00:41:27.719
solutions of the nuclear
potential,

00:41:27.719 --> 00:41:32.684
because you never put on a
field as strong as the field

00:41:32.684 --> 00:41:36.179
felt by the electron near a
nucleus.

00:41:36.179 --> 00:41:39.389
Adding the external field by
turning up your dial is just a

00:41:39.389 --> 00:41:40.219
small change.
 

00:41:40.219 --> 00:41:43.485
So you want things to look
pretty much like what they

00:41:43.485 --> 00:41:45.682
looked originally,
with the nucleus,

00:41:45.682 --> 00:41:48.384
just a little change,
and you can do that by

00:41:48.384 --> 00:41:49.639
hybridization.
 

00:41:49.639 --> 00:41:53.663
Okay, the big deal is the
nuclear potential at small

00:41:53.663 --> 00:41:54.610
distances.
 

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:58.590
Now, let's try to go to a
two-electron wave function.

00:41:58.590 --> 00:41:59.409
Okay?
 

00:41:59.409 --> 00:42:01.829
So what's it a function of?
 

00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:05.492
What's a two-electron wave
function going to be a function

00:42:05.492 --> 00:42:07.099
of, how many variables?
 

00:42:07.099 --> 00:42:08.980
Students:  Six.
 

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:11.440
Prof: Right, six, right?
 

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.710
x,y,z for
one electron,

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:16.000
and x,y,z
for the other electron,

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.376
or r,
Î¸,

00:42:17.376 --> 00:42:19.492
Ï† of electron one,
and r,

00:42:19.492 --> 00:42:21.239
Î¸,
Ï† of electron two,

00:42:21.239 --> 00:42:23.612
and they're on the same
nucleus, so you measure the

00:42:23.612 --> 00:42:26.166
distances from the same point,
but they're two different

00:42:26.166 --> 00:42:27.782
distances,
one to electron one,

00:42:27.782 --> 00:42:29.210
another to electron two.
 

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:32.123
They could be the same,
but they don't need to be,

00:42:32.123 --> 00:42:33.670
they could be different.
 

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:36.489
Okay?
 

00:42:36.489 --> 00:42:40.514
Now wouldn't it be neat --
that's the question mark -- if

00:42:40.514 --> 00:42:45.329
we could get that by multiplying
two one-electron wave functions?

00:42:45.329 --> 00:42:47.940
Because we have one-electron
wave functions cold;

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:50.619
we look in the table and we've
got the exact thing.

00:42:50.619 --> 00:42:54.030
If we could take two of those
and multiply them together,

00:42:54.030 --> 00:43:00.974
so orbital A for electron one
times orbital B for electron two

00:43:00.974 --> 00:43:03.172
--
remember, what these things are

00:43:03.172 --> 00:43:04.130
is just numbers.
 

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:07.661
If you put in some value of
position of electron one and

00:43:07.661 --> 00:43:10.360
some value of position of
electron two,

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.110
this first thing will give you
a number,

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:13.980
the second thing will give you
a number.

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.947
If you could multiply those two
numbers together and get the

00:43:16.947 --> 00:43:18.860
number for the total wave
function,

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:22.429
that would be really great,
because then you'd know how to

00:43:22.429 --> 00:43:22.929
do it.
 

00:43:22.929 --> 00:43:25.010
The question is,
can you do that?

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:27.940
Remember, an orbital is a
one-electron wave function.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:32.744
So can we multiply orbitals in
order to get a many-electron

00:43:32.744 --> 00:43:34.070
wave function?
 

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:38.405
If we could -- and then,
of course, we would square it

00:43:38.405 --> 00:43:40.780
to get probability density.
 

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.469
Now it would be a different
probability.

00:43:42.469 --> 00:43:45.393
In the first case it was
probability of electron one

00:43:45.393 --> 00:43:46.139
being here.
 

00:43:46.139 --> 00:43:49.434
Now it's the joint probability
of electron one is here,

00:43:49.434 --> 00:43:52.119
and electron two at the same
time is here;

00:43:52.119 --> 00:43:55.809
that's the probability when you
have six variables.

00:43:55.809 --> 00:43:56.480
Okay?
 

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.539
Wouldn't that be great?
 

00:43:58.539 --> 00:44:02.239
It's just paradise, right?
 

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:05.440
Because if we had many
electrons we could just multiply

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:08.637
all those orbitals together,
a certain orbital for electron

00:44:08.637 --> 00:44:10.050
one,
another orbital for electron

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:11.559
two, another one for electron
three.

00:44:11.559 --> 00:44:14.068
We know how to write those;
multiply them together,

00:44:14.068 --> 00:44:15.030
we get the thing.
 

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:18.231
We find the total energy is
whatever energy electron one

00:44:18.231 --> 00:44:20.849
had, plus whatever energy
electron two had.

00:44:20.849 --> 00:44:22.119
That's great.
 

00:44:22.119 --> 00:44:24.679
We find the total electron
density.

00:44:24.679 --> 00:44:27.090
We know how to find the
electron density of each

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:28.219
individual electron.
 

00:44:28.219 --> 00:44:31.518
So the total electron density
should be just the sum of those.

00:44:31.518 --> 00:44:34.554
So if we were interested in the
total electron density at this

00:44:34.554 --> 00:44:37.170
particular point,
we'd see what the electron

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:39.849
density of electron one is at
that point,

00:44:39.849 --> 00:44:42.882
and what the electron density
of electron two is at that

00:44:42.882 --> 00:44:44.539
point,
and we'd add them together and

00:44:44.539 --> 00:44:46.280
that would give the total
electron density,

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.619
at that point.
 

00:44:47.619 --> 00:44:50.507
So the total electron density
is a function of x,

00:44:50.507 --> 00:44:51.130
y, z.
 

00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:53.025
It's whatever this is,
evaluated at x,

00:44:53.025 --> 00:44:54.664
y, z,
plus whatever this,

00:44:54.664 --> 00:44:55.699
plus all the others.
 

00:44:55.699 --> 00:44:58.489
Absolutely wonderful. Right?
 

00:44:58.489 --> 00:45:00.170
And then you could write things.
 

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:03.400
So the whole is the sum of the
parts.

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:04.119
Right?
 

00:45:04.119 --> 00:45:06.260
And you could write things like
this at the top,

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.266
that Neon has the
configuration:

00:45:08.266 --> 00:45:11.447
two electrons in 1s,
two electrons in 2s,

00:45:11.447 --> 00:45:13.190
two electrons in
2p_x,

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:14.201
2p_y.
 

00:45:14.201 --> 00:45:14.659
Right?
 

00:45:14.659 --> 00:45:15.239
Things like that.
 

00:45:15.239 --> 00:45:17.079
You've seen things like that.
 

00:45:17.079 --> 00:45:20.583
So those are the orbitals in
which electrons are,

00:45:20.583 --> 00:45:22.481
to describe the neon atom.
 

00:45:22.481 --> 00:45:23.139
Right?
 

00:45:23.139 --> 00:45:29.989
Now, this is a problem in joint
probability.

00:45:29.989 --> 00:45:35.820
So it's like tossing two coins
to try to get to two heads.

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:39.911
So I don't know if I can do
these at the same time,

00:45:39.911 --> 00:45:42.449
but I have two quarters here.
 

00:45:42.449 --> 00:45:45.079
Need your back of your hand.
 

00:45:45.079 --> 00:45:46.300
Okay, so I got tails.
 

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:46.900
What did you get?
 

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:47.340
Student:  Heads.
 

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.420
Prof: How often?
 

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:49.960
Student:  Half the time.
 

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.039
Prof: Half the time.
 

00:45:51.039 --> 00:45:54.673
Actually if I get tails and you
get heads, that's a quarter of

00:45:54.673 --> 00:45:55.329
the time.
 

00:45:55.329 --> 00:45:55.920
Student:  Yes,
that's a quarter of the time.

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.045
Prof: But a quarter of
the time you'll get tails and

00:45:58.045 --> 00:45:58.670
I'll get heads.
 

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:01.239
So heads/tails is half the time.
 

00:46:01.239 --> 00:46:03.690
How about heads/heads,
how often?

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:04.409
Student:  Heads/heads.
 

00:46:04.409 --> 00:46:04.989
Still a quarter.
 

00:46:04.989 --> 00:46:05.849
Prof: A quarter of the
time.

00:46:05.849 --> 00:46:09.766
Now I'll bet you,
I'll bet you that I can get

00:46:09.766 --> 00:46:14.840
head/head half the time,
actually doing the experiment.

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:15.949
Student:  Yes.
 

00:46:15.949 --> 00:46:17.619
Prof: You want to take
the bet?

00:46:17.619 --> 00:46:19.059
I would advise against it.
 

00:46:19.059 --> 00:46:20.059
&gt;
 

00:46:20.059 --> 00:46:25.590
Prof: Okay,
here's what I'm going to do.

00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:34.369
&lt;&lt;Professor McBride tapes
the quarters together&gt;&gt;

00:46:34.369 --> 00:46:36.420
Prof: Two tails, I lose.
 

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:39.750
&gt;
 

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:41.030
Prof: Whoops.
 

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.289
&gt;
 

00:46:41.289 --> 00:46:42.849
Prof: Two tails,
I lost again.

00:46:42.849 --> 00:46:46.193
But I think you can see that if
I do it a lot of times I'm going

00:46:46.193 --> 00:46:47.307
to win half the time.
 

00:46:47.307 --> 00:46:47.679
Why?
 

00:46:47.679 --> 00:46:51.289
Why was the rule wrong?
 

00:46:51.289 --> 00:46:53.599
Prof: Because they
weren't independent,

00:46:53.599 --> 00:46:54.010
right?
 

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:58.880
If they're independent,
the probability of both A and

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.322
B,
that is, the probability that A

00:47:01.322 --> 00:47:04.570
will be here and at the same
time B will be here,

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:06.719
is the product of the
probabilities;

00:47:06.719 --> 00:47:11.583
but if you do this,
that's not true anymore.

00:47:11.583 --> 00:47:12.489
Right?
 

00:47:12.489 --> 00:47:15.639
So if you have a two-electron
wave function,

00:47:15.639 --> 00:47:19.940
you square it to get the joint
probability,

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:23.135
that electron one will be here
and electron two will be here at

00:47:23.135 --> 00:47:23.960
the same time.
 

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:26.170
So is that valid,
to multiply -- here I'm

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:29.376
multiplying the individual
probabilities that electron A is

00:47:29.376 --> 00:47:32.019
at a certain position,
electron B is at another

00:47:32.019 --> 00:47:32.500
position.
 

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.018
Do I get the joint probability
that way?

00:47:35.018 --> 00:47:37.878
Well under what conditions do I
get the joint probability that

00:47:37.878 --> 00:47:38.159
way?
 

00:47:38.159 --> 00:47:38.789
Students:
 If they're independent.

00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:39.679
Prof: If they're
independent.

00:47:39.679 --> 00:47:41.610
Now, here's the big question.
 

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:42.639
Are they independent?
 

00:47:42.639 --> 00:47:43.409
Students:  No.
 

00:47:43.409 --> 00:47:44.380
Prof: Why not?
 

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:46.534
Prof: Because of
Coulomb's law,

00:47:46.534 --> 00:47:47.989
they repel one another.
 

00:47:47.989 --> 00:47:50.639
There's no way they can be
independent, they repel one

00:47:50.639 --> 00:47:51.139
another.
 

00:47:51.139 --> 00:47:55.983
So orbitals,
one-electron wave functions,

00:47:55.983 --> 00:48:03.130
to express many-electron wave
functions, cannot be right.

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:08.132
Orbitals are a fiction,
except for one-electron

00:48:08.132 --> 00:48:09.110
problems.
 

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:10.090
Right?
 

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:13.949
hydrogen-like atoms fine;
we've got hydrogen atoms cold.

00:48:13.949 --> 00:48:20.050
But if you got more than one
electron, orbitals won't work.

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:23.340
But still we're going to use
them.

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:23.820
&gt;
 

00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:24.739
Prof: Right?
 

00:48:24.739 --> 00:48:27.010
And that's what you're going to
find out after the exam.

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:32.561
Okay, good luck on -- so that
doesn't work -- good luck on the

00:48:32.561 --> 00:48:33.199
exam.

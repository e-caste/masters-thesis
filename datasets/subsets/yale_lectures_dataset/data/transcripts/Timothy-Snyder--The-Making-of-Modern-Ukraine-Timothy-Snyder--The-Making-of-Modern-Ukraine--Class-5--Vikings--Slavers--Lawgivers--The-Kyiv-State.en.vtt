00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.843
(somber music)

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:14.370
- All right, everybody, greetings.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.330
Happy Tuesday.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.580
It's good to see you all.

00:00:19.194 --> 00:00:20.070
I'm used to being wired

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.360
and I'm used to teaching classes,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.590
but I'm not used to being wired

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.700
while I teach classes.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.810
And so this has led me

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.120
to a certain number already of missteps.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.460
Like, for example, in
the previous lecture,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.160
when I unwittingly doxxed my TFs

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.750
by telling, saying what their name was

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.670
and making them stand up and turn around,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.010
as a result of which, they're
all now getting thousands

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.110
of emails from the admirers

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.428
of all of the stages of
their short lives, right?

00:00:43.428 --> 00:00:44.520
(students laugh)
So I didn't think

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.353
of that, guys.

00:00:45.353 --> 00:00:46.203
I'm sorry.

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:50.430
The other interesting
feature of doing it this way

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.380
is that like for every one of you,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.510
there are literally like 10,000

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.310
other people watching, or 1,000,

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.982
let's not exaggerate, but
there's like behind you,

00:00:58.982 --> 00:01:00.240
there are like 1,000 people out there

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.440
who are watching.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.270
And it turns out they also have views,

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.950
which is interesting.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.420
And like they're just writing.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.190
You know, they're not
coming to office hours.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.900
Oh, speaking of which,
come to office hours.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.100
Some of you have come to office hours.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.450
It's really nice to be able to get

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.733
to know you personally,
if only for a moment.

00:01:15.584 --> 00:01:16.590
And it helps me teach,

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.360
if I figure out what
you're actually getting

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.640
and what you're actually not getting.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.680
Okay, I promise you that by the end

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.750
of this lecture, something's gonna happen.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.710
In the previous lectures,

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.630
we've been mainly trying to set things up.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.460
We've been thinking about what history is.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.630
We've been thinking about

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.160
basic problems of history.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.800
We've been working on
the colonial perspective,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.180
and how you work your way out

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.580
from under a colonial perspective.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.050
By the end of this lecture, I promise

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.543
there will be a state which is in Kyiv.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.390
I'm going to deliver on that promise.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.800
That is definitely gonna happen.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.320
But I'm gonna begin with one more remark

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.580
about what we're doing,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.380
because it's really important.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.030
Like, as we're in the middle of a war

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.430
in which crimes are being committed

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.890
and people are dying and killing

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.000
because of certainties

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.130
about what had to happen in the past,

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.750
or what has to happen in the future,

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.580
it's very important to understand

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.290
that history is not that.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.570
History is not about predetermination.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.760
It's not about what has to be.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.000
History can do, is it can be a kind

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.760
of guide to what was possible, right?

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.700
So there is a Ukrainian society

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.110
and Ukrainian state today,

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.780
which means that it
must have been possible.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.460
The most we can do

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.960
is we can guide ourselves

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.490
towards a greater understanding

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.770
of how such a thing was possible.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.600
But when we get to that border

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.130
of how much we can understand,

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.870
there always has to be room

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.600
for what the people actually did, right?

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.620
Not just the people today,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.553
but the people all the way back

00:02:42.553 --> 00:02:44.010
1,000 years ago or more,

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.330
that we'll be talking about today.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.640
Had their choices been somewhat different,

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.870
then other things also

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.490
would have been somewhat different.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.130
So even as we push our
understanding forward

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.300
as far as it can go,

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.560
we're always keeping in mind

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.960
that what people do and the
choices that people make

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.110
are beyond our ability to predict.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.390
And that's why history is, in a way,

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.680
like it's a science,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.060
we're trying to figure things out,

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.380
but it's also a humanity,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.150
where we leave room for human agency.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.010
We try to understand human agency.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.170
At the same time, we
know that human agency,

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.670
you don't understand it
with the same methods

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.070
that you understand mountains and rivers.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.000
Okay.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.030
So the big idea today

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.220
is how you get to a state.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.110
And that is a big idea, right?

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.150
I mean, like you might have noticed

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.740
that whenever there's a country,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.940
whenever there's a state,

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.230
there's always a legend

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.700
about how it came to be.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.160
Like, for example,
there's an American legend

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.780
of how America came to be.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.800
This isn't my strong suit.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.660
You guys can correct me, but
I think George Washington

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.100
felled the cherry tree.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.780
And then 13 cherries fell,

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.890
and from each of them

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.190
came a colony, something like that.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.390
I don't know, but everyone has a.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.724
Thank you. Okay.

00:03:49.724 --> 00:03:50.557
(laughs) Good.

00:03:50.557 --> 00:03:51.690
We have an American studies student here

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.310
who says, "Yep, that's what it was."

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.480
All right.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.760
So, but everyone has an origin story,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.650
which mixes usually some element

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.300
of what happened with some element

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.380
of what it would be nice

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.430
to think about what happened.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.830
And the reason why everybody
has an origin story

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.440
is that it's hard to explain

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.350
how you get from no polity to a polity.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.910
And it's usually complicated,

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.070
and it's best to have a
story about us and them,

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.970
and how it's very simple.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.380
And those stories are never true.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.300
But it is authentically hard.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.800
So in this lecture today,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.820
we're gonna be talking about

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.490
some general causal forces

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.600
which made it likely

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.150
that there would be
states coming into being

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.640
in Eastern Europe around the year 1000.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.530
And those general causal forces

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.200
are things like Christianity,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.200
and what Christianity could do for people,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.093
for rulers and for others.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.090
Secondly, the fact that Christianity

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.860
was not a singularity,

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.630
but Christianity was a plurality.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.060
There were two versions of Christianity

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.050
that were emerging.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.490
From our point of view,

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.993
a Western version and a Southern version,

00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:55.530
a Frankish version and
a Byzantine version.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.210
And those two versions of Christianity,

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.710
it wasn't their theological differences

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:59.543
that mattered so much.

00:04:59.543 --> 00:05:01.080
It was that they were represented

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.420
by two strong political units

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.120
that were pushing outward imperially

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.520
into our region,

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.070
in competition with one another.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.113
In competition with one another.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.480
And then underlying all this

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.000
is the basic economic status

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.470
of the place we're talking about,

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.350
where nomads are still coming and going,

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.950
where slavery is still very prominent.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.990
And when you think of what statehood does

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.060
for people, one of the things

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.077
that statehood does for people,

00:05:31.077 --> 00:05:33.210
and this is not just
true in Eastern Europe,

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.280
this is a sort of general characterization

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.540
of what a state is,

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.330
statehood protects the people

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.950
that the state recognizes

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.963
from being enslaved by other people.

00:05:46.244 --> 00:05:49.020
So the basic economics

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.960
of the globalization that
we're in at this point,

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.480
circa 800, 900, 1000,

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.270
is a globalization of a slave trade,

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.460
in which the human beings
of our part of the world

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.220
are being shipped, very
far distances sometimes,

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.930
in order to be enslaved.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.550
That is a form of global economics.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.860
It persists and expands and continues

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.090
well beyond our region,

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.500
well beyond this time.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.560
What a state can do is put
a stop to that locally.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.308
A state can say, "We recognize you.

00:06:16.308 --> 00:06:17.617
"We have the coercive means to make sure

00:06:17.617 --> 00:06:19.387
"that you will not be sold into slavery.

00:06:19.387 --> 00:06:22.297
"We also have the
coercive means to tax you.

00:06:22.297 --> 00:06:25.297
"So we prefer," making
a very long story short,

00:06:25.297 --> 00:06:27.847
"We prefer that you stay
here and work the land,

00:06:27.847 --> 00:06:29.557
"and we tax you,

00:06:29.557 --> 00:06:31.777
"rather than we capture you

00:06:31.777 --> 00:06:33.240
"and sell you into slavery."

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.670
And, you know, not to make you too cynical

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.050
about the world, because I know

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.750
you're, you know, young and naive,

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.930
but the same people who do the enslaving

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.270
are also often the same
people who start the state.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.670
And that's gonna be true
in our case as well, right?

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.170
The people who are doing the enslaving

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.670
are also gonna be the same people who,

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.890
by the end of the story,
are gonna start the state.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.350
So there's a general story

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.970
about causality here,

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.290
but then there's a particular story

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.310
that I want you to keep in mind, too,

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.080
and be thinking about, which is, okay,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.910
maybe Professor Snyder is right,

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.060
that Christianity, the
clash of two Christianities,

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.120
this economic and human issue

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.980
of slavery, that these made it likely

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.270
that there would be states.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.630
Fine, but why some states and not others?

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.150
Why some states and not others?

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.040
From the point of view of
a national historiography,

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.170
this question never arises, right?

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.490
Your state is always inevitable.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.230
Others people's states
might be questionable,

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.670
but yours is always inevitable,

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.080
but it's a real question.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.750
Why some states and not others?

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.150
Why Kyivan Rus'? Why Kyivan Rus'?

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.740
And here, we're gonna
get into particularities,

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.260
which involve Vikings,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.000
which involve rivers,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.550
which involve Khazars,
and which also involve,

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:42.720
and this is very important,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.060
the presence of other Slavic states.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.230
So a huge amount of politics is copying.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.210
A huge amount of politics is taking things

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.590
which someone else has already done

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:53.940
in a neighboring place,

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.560
and applying them yourself.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.620
So it's very important for Kyivan Rus',

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.720
that there was already Moravia

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.120
and that there was already Bulgaria.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.630
Okay, so you remember the basic setup

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:07.863
of where we are.

00:08:10.943 --> 00:08:11.910
We've tried to set up

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.810
this period in various different ways.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.350
Europe is being created, right?

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.270
So again, Europe seems self-evident,

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.287
but the difference between Europe

00:08:19.287 --> 00:08:20.790
and the classical world

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.340
is that Europe is north
of the Mediterranean,

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.350
and the classical world goes around

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.660
the Mediterranean, right?

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.630
So when the classical world

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.310
blends into Europe

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:35.220
is when Islam begins, in the 7th century,

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.840
and the line between Europe

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.420
and what's not Europe then
becomes a Christendom,

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.700
non-Christendom sort of divide, right?

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.070
There are famous, you know, examples

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.570
of when we should think of this.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.000
The 720s, when the French

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.980
stop Arab armies in Poitiers.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.730
The 750s, when the
Khazars stop Arab armies

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:54.750
in the Caucuses.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.130
Those are kind of symbolic.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.350
But the basic idea is that Europe

00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.730
is now north of something,

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:00.750
whereas the classical world

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.000
encircled something, right?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.460
So Europe is coming into being,

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.110
and is coming into being

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.690
as the failure of Christianity

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:10.770
south of the Mediterranean,

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.420
or the serious decline of Christianity

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.253
south of Mediterranean,

00:09:13.253 --> 00:09:15.060
and the spread of Christianity

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.530
north of the Mediterranean,

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.590
up into, eventually into Scandinavia,

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:20.730
around the year 1000,

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.850
and into Eastern Europe,
around the year 1000.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.000
Remembering that these are territories,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.680
Scandinavia, Eastern Europe,

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.300
which were not directly part

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.130
of the classical world, right?

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.130
So they're going from their
own versions of paganism,

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.670
which we've talked
about, into Christianity.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.240
Okay, so this brings us to the question,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.130
which we're gonna look at
now in a little more depth,

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:48.510
of what is Christianity
at this time, right?

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.040
And this is tough because,

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.080
I mean, many of you will
have been raised Christians

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.060
or have some contact with Christianity.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.310
And the Christianity that
we have in the third decade

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.960
of the 21st century

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.370
has all kinds of varieties.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.050
And these varieties all
have their traditions,

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:02.130
some of them going back to this thing

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.630
called the Reformation or
the Counter Reformation.

00:10:06.304 --> 00:10:08.280
We need to sort of clear
our minds of all that,

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.010
and try to think what
Christianity looked like

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.680
to pagans, from the point of view

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.440
of the 9th and 10th and 11th centuries.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.483
And to make a long story short,

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.630
it's almost always true

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.910
that when you convert as a ruler,

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.790
you're not converting because you believe.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:27.753
I'm sorry.

00:10:30.478 --> 00:10:32.460
You might believe, I'm not
saying it's impossible,

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.990
but you're generally converting

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.090
because the religion in question

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.980
is bringing something to you

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:41.640
that your native cult does not have.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.550
Like, for example, a written language,

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.110
a set of elites who can use

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.190
that written language,

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.890
who can be your ambassadors
and your bureaucrats,

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.530
like legitimacy with other states, right?

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.320
So from the point of view of pagan rulers

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.450
looking outward at this world,

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.210
the math was working against them.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.740
What do I mean by the math?

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.720
The math of slavery, okay?

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.493
So if you're a pagan,

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.400
everyone can enslave you.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.687
And for a while, you might say,

00:11:10.687 --> 00:11:13.263
"Well, I can enslave everyone else.

00:11:15.206 --> 00:11:16.039
"I can enslave other pagans.

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:17.910
"I can enslave Christians.
I can enslave Muslims."

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.760
And so long as the power
balance is on your side,

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.070
that may seem like an acceptable answer.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.840
And for the Grand Duchy of Lithuania

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.780
that we'll be talking about next lecture,

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.950
that was an acceptable answer

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.810
all the way until the 14th century.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:32.280
They did much more enslaving

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.810
than people did,
enslaving of their people.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:35.670
They stayed pagans for a very long time.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:36.690
It worked for them.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.840
But what I mean by the
math is that Christians

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.610
are not supposed to enslave Christians.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.350
Muslims are not supposed
to enslave Muslims.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.952
When Christian and Muslim states fight,

00:11:45.952 --> 00:11:47.130
they'll do exchanges and so on.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.810
But so long as you're a pagan,

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.700
you're fair game for everyone.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.220
And so territorially,

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.610
as Christianity spreads into Europe,

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.960
there are more and more of them,

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.910
and fewer and fewer of you, right?

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:02.910
So every time some other state converts

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.550
to Christianity, the math is getting worse

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.750
for you as a pagan.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.370
There are more and more situations

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.050
where you can be enslaved,

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.190
and fewer and fewer situations

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:12.450
where you're gonna find it practicable

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.700
to enslave other people.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.780
It's just kind of a general logic.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.220
Okay, I realize that's a strange answer

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.560
to the question of what is Christianity,

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.700
but what is Christianity

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.090
is fundamentally a way of
joining a Christian order

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.340
of states in which you're not supposed

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.660
to enslave the other people,

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.270
who are also subjects of a
Christian order of state.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:33.690
More specifically, Christianity means

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.370
these two varieties of Christianity.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.140
So when I say that Christianity is a power

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.060
and that it brings with it recognition,

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.400
okay, recognition by whom?

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.590
Recognition by the Franks

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.543
coming from the west,

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.930
or recognition from the Byzantines

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.430
coming from the south?

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.410
As you know, the Franks and the Byzantines

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.660
have two different
accounts of what happened

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.100
to the Roman Empire.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.720
It fell, and we rebuilt it.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.400
Very beautiful. That's the Franks.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.800
Or it never fell. We are it.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.003
Also very beautiful.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.820
That's the Byzantines.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.160
So these are two relationships

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.073
to the classical world,
but more importantly,

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.850
these are two powers

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.160
that are moving into Eastern Europe.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.487
The Franks, so let's get
some more detail about this.

00:13:20.487 --> 00:13:21.540
The great leader of the Franks.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.610
So this is not a course in French history,

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:25.500
but you'll find that we have to talk about

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.120
what the French, 'cause France, frankly,

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.410
was very important, okay?

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.740
So we will keep coming back to things

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.180
that happened in what's
now France and Germany

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.643
because France and Germany
are very important.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:38.400
The turning point here,

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.350
the coronation of Charlemagne

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.690
as king of the Franks on Christmas Day

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:43.650
of the year 800.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:44.730
Very easy to.

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:45.693
He calls it the.

00:13:48.074 --> 00:13:48.907
(indistinct)

00:13:48.907 --> 00:13:51.150
He calls it the restoration of empire.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.653
Christmas Day, 800.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.690
Charlemagne just means Charles the Great.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:59.700
And incidentally, the word Charles.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.620
So there's now another
king called Charles, right?

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:02.880
Am I up on my news?

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.800
So the word Charles

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.880
in Slavic languages.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.230
Well, how do you say like Charles

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.283
in a Slavic language?

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.413
Any Slavic language.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:12.683
Hm?
- Karel.

00:14:12.683 --> 00:14:14.220
- Karel. Karel is good.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.520
Okay, so that name Charles

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.050
becomes the Slavic word,

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.123
or a Slavic word, for king,

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.600
which is, I mean, that's
kind of impressive, right?

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.620
Like, I mean, that's the sort of thing,

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.510
like if you were a rapper,

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.954
you would want your name to become

00:14:29.954 --> 00:14:31.290
the word for king, right?

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:32.640
And I'm just gonna say now,

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.950
no rapper is ever going
to achieve that, right?

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.040
I mean, no rapper is ever
gonna outdo Charlemagne

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.600
on this front, I don't think.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.530
Okay.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:41.670
I mean, I'm just, I'm happy to have

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.440
that prediction on tape.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.530
So Charles, in French,

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.290
Charles, Charles, becomes Karl

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.680
or Karol in Slavic languages,

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.910
which is the word for king.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:55.230
In Polish, it's Karol.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.340
Ukrainian, Karl.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.950
So the very idea of kingship

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:00.870
is coming from this kingdom

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.300
of the Franks established in 800.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.550
And it is a new model state.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:06.660
It's the model state

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.520
which is then going to prevail in Europe,

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:12.810
very importantly, where the king accepts

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.000
that he is a Christian ruler,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.260
and he accepts, for example,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.540
that he can be crowned by a pope,

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.480
but he's not subordinate to the pope.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.380
Whereas in the south, in Byzantium,

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.440
the idea of kingship is
going to be very different.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.470
The idea is that

00:15:32.463 --> 00:15:36.000
the secular ruler and the religious power

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.830
are very much in alignment.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.093
We'll return to that.

00:15:41.228 --> 00:15:44.430
So the word for ruler in
much of Eastern Europe

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.880
is czar, which comes from Caesar, right,

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.230
which comes from Rome.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:50.730
That's the Byzantine tradition.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.560
So the very words that you have

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.570
for the supreme leader
in a political system

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.610
are coming from these two rival powers.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.520
Okay, so what can we say about the south?

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.780
We've already said a lot of it.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.240
Byzantium, the Byzantine empire.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.650
Capital in Constantinople,

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.570
which is today Istanbul.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.700
There's a song by They
Might Be Giants about that,

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.350
which I'm sure those of you
who are into oldies know.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.830
It's been the capital of the Roman Empire

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.900
since the 4th century.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.520
From the point of view of Byzantium,

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.140
there's an unbroken succession

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.820
of legitimate Roman emperors

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.080
the entire time.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.570
They refer to themselves as the Romans.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:26.013
They do so speaking Greek.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.950
That's Byzantium.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:30.903
That city, Constantinople,

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.070
is unparalleled in the Europe of the time.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:37.593
It's 10, 20, 30 times bigger than.

00:16:39.645 --> 00:16:41.245
It's 30 times bigger than Paris.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:43.980
You know, we don't know exactly how big,

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.840
but maybe something like a million people.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.200
A tremendous scale of a city for the time.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.480
And gloriously beautiful in a way

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.310
which no European city

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:56.580
can vaguely think of rivaling.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.290
And still worth a visit, by the way.

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:00.090
Still lovely, Istanbul.

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:01.620
Worth a visit.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.060
I was there on my honeymoon.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.500
It was worth it. Okay.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.660
So the differences between the Franks

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:07.620
and the Byzantines.

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.180
We've listed several of them.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.700
Two claims to the Roman
inheritance, right?

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.200
Two varieties of Christianity,

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.000
although the theology's not so important.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.560
Two different relationships between state

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.390
and secular power, where in Byzantium,

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:21.420
state and, sorry, state
and religious power,

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.070
state and spiritual power

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:24.720
are much more carefully lined up.

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:27.903
Two relationships between
lords and vassals.

00:17:29.623 --> 00:17:31.050
In the Frankish political tradition,

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.180
the vassals are gonna be lined up

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.800
in something which we think
of as a feudal system,

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.390
where they have the right to property

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.490
and have a certain amount of autonomy.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.980
That is going to be
less true in Byzantium.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.320
But both of them are in Europe,

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.640
and both of them are in a Europe

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.730
which is pushing into the pagan world.

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:50.580
There are the Scandinavians
to be converted,

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.310
there are the Celts to be converted

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.863
and there are the Slavs to be converted.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.353
The Celts.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.450
The Celts, you know, the Scots,

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.270
the Irish, they're out
of reach of Byzantium.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.190
The Scandinavians, it turns out,

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.680
are also out of reach of Byzantium,

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.401
except for the Scandinavians
who travel to Kyiv,

00:18:10.401 --> 00:18:11.640
which we're gonna get to,

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.830
but the Slavs are not out of reach.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.210
And the Slavs are the biggest group,

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:16.590
the Slavs are the biggest prize,

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.210
and the Slavs are an object

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.730
of direct and explicit competition

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.743
between these two powers.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.050
Byzantium is already there,

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:26.760
with its missionary activity.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.170
We mentioned Cyril and Methodius.

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:32.190
That's an example of missionary
activity from Byzantium.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:35.220
The Franks set up an archbishopric

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.180
in the German city of Magdeburg

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.053
in 962.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.930
And that is a kind of outpost

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:50.130
of missionary activity.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.770
So when you think of these archbishoprics.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.020
So the way that the
Christian Church in the West

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.800
is set up, there are
bishops, and the bishop

00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.940
of Rome is the highest bishop,

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.100
and he's known as the pope, right?

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.960
Underneath the pope,
there are archbishops,

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.860
who have territory.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.330
Underneath the archbishops,
there are bishops,

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.350
and they have territory.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:08.730
Underneath the bishops, there are priests,

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:09.990
and the priests have territory.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.063
And that territory is known as a parish.

00:19:13.689 --> 00:19:15.270
It's all beautifully organized.

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.867
But when you think of
these archbishoprics,

00:19:16.867 --> 00:19:19.980
you should be thinking of
imperial expansion, too.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.340
Magdeburg is about imperial
expansion to the west.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.140
And Bremen, by the way,

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.120
is about imperial expansion to the north.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.390
So when the German speakers
are trying to convert

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:32.490
the Scandinavians, they're
doing it from Bremen.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:34.080
In the meantime, people
are also trying to convert

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.060
the Scandinavians from England.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.980
But the Scandinavians are out of reach.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.406
I just mentioned this as another example.

00:19:40.406 --> 00:19:41.783
This is also a nice place to visit.

00:19:43.418 --> 00:19:46.110
The Scandinavians are out of
reach, but the Slavs are not.

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.730
Okay.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.950
This all hooks together.

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:51.960
It all connects when everyone.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.144
And, you know, if you try to think, like,

00:19:54.144 --> 00:19:56.280
what is the one thing which causes this?

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.260
Things are always connecting, right?

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.200
So if I say, "What does
religion have to do with it?"

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.510
Well, religion has to do
with creating a state,

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.220
but it also has to do
with not being enslaved,

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.330
and eventually, it has
to do with what people

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.300
actually believe, and these
things are all connected.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:10.747
If I say, at this part of the lecture,

00:20:10.747 --> 00:20:12.510
"What do the Vikings have to do with it?"

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:14.670
The Vikings come in

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:17.280
to the history of both the Franks

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.290
and the Byzantines, right?

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.960
Because this period
that we're talking about

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.400
is the Viking age.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.620
The Viking age begins in 793.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.500
That's when the Vikings
first make themselves known.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.000
And if you say the Viking age,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.290
it's like now we cut

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.510
to a completely different movie, right?

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:34.620
We forget everything else.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.060
It's just the wooden ships

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.190
with their beautiful
brows and the burly men

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:39.780
and the beards and the horns

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.370
and the throwing the
spears over the enemy,

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.650
which probably is a myth,
and the berserker thing,

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:45.090
which is also probably a myth.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.910
But we're cutting to a completely
different story, right?

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:49.560
And that's what we can't do,

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.740
because the Viking age is
happening simultaneously

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.360
with the expansion of the Franks

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.920
and with the expansion of the Byzantines,

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.990
and it's related to these two things.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.490
It is the expansion of the Franks

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:01.560
which probably provokes the Vikings

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.080
to test out their own naval technology

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.000
by plundering the Franks. (laughs)

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.590
And then, realizing they can do this,

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:08.610
they can get down rivers,

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:09.840
they can do interesting things,

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.000
they can also go out to sea
and do interesting things.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.810
So the Vikings are
probably best understood

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:18.840
as a reaction to Charlemagne.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.210
And in their reaction,

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:23.220
as they realize that
there are an awful lot

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.530
of rivers they could go
down in river in Europe,

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.240
and there's an awful lot
that could be plundered,

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.230
or looking at it more sympathetically,

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.823
trade routes to be established,

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:37.620
this brings them to Eastern Europe

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:38.970
and to Byzantium.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:40.410
And I know you guys are wondering why

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:41.970
I keep obsessing about the mountains

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.140
and the rivers and all these things

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.790
that don't matter anymore
because the internet,

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:48.300
I know, but you can't figure out

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.530
what the Vikings are up to

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.510
without knowing where the rivers are.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.580
The Vikings are trying to
get from north to south,

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.010
because they're trying to
make a huge amount of money.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:58.710
There's a lot of silver
down there with the Arabs,

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:00.150
and they can get that silver,

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:01.890
and they can bury it in big hoards,

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:04.403
which is what they like to
do, for mysterious reasons.

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:08.100
It's really great for
archeologists and for historians,

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.247
because we can say, "Okay, look,

00:22:09.247 --> 00:22:11.197
"here is a hoard of coins,

00:22:11.197 --> 00:22:12.700
"which were clearly minted

00:22:14.292 --> 00:22:16.627
"in an Arab-speaking place at this time.

00:22:16.627 --> 00:22:19.140
"But look, it's in Northwestern Russia."

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.130
And how do we explain that?

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:21.840
And we explain it with the Vikings, right?

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.540
So the Vikings are trying
to make a lot of money

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.580
by trading from north to south.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.650
And they do that with their technology,

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:30.240
which is the boat,

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.310
but they have to find a way, right?

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:33.960
So they try to get down with the Volga,

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.950
which doesn't work.

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:37.380
They try to get down with the Dnipro,

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.330
which does work, right,
the river which runs

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:40.290
through the middle of Ukraine.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:41.640
They eventually find their way down

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.840
and they eventually start to trade.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:46.140
But this means that our
Vikings, these Vikings,

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.460
who are known as the Rus',

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.650
these Vikings come into contact

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:52.560
with Byzantium.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.570
They come into contact
with Byzantium, right?

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:56.760
Byzantium is the big economic

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.100
and political power
down there in the south.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.930
And they're aiming for Byzantium.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.700
They're trying to get down to Byzantium.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.760
And a midpoint, a beautiful trading post

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.210
along the way, is Kyiv, right?

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:10.770
So our Viking age

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.590
is not just like, you know,
Erik the Red and Iceland

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:15.030
and the sagas, all of which is cool.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:17.760
And by the way, some of
our Ukrainian figures

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.380
actually appear in Icelandic sagas,

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.560
which gives you a sense
of how it's all connected.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.480
But the Viking age is about the Franks,

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.280
and it's also about Byzantium,

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.630
because the Vikings are trying

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:29.250
to make their way down to Byzantium,

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.470
and that's why they get to Kyiv,

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:34.170
which has already existed
for several centuries.

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:35.003
Okay.

00:23:36.626 --> 00:23:38.913
So Eastern Europe, what is Eastern Europe?

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.540
One is always struggling for a reason

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.180
to explain why Eastern Europe,
and not Western Europe.

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.310
What's special about our little zone,

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.980
which includes Kyiv and
what's gonna be Ukraine,

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:53.340
in this context, is that it is between

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.200
these two different kinds of Christianity.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.790
Not just in some kind of metaphorical way,

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:58.560
like lands in between, blah, blah.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.790
It's between them in the sense

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.920
that the Franks and the Byzantines

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.370
are striving to control these territories.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.250
But it's also in between, in the sense

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:09.870
that it's Eastern Europe, or at least

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:10.920
our part of Eastern Europe,

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.810
where the Vikings, who
have been in contact

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:14.880
with both the Franks and want contact

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.130
with the Byzantines, make their way.

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:20.130
Okay, so those are a lotta
the important pieces,

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:23.370
the Franks, the Byzantines, Vikings.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.290
Oh, how the Vikings make their money,

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:26.828
they are slavers.

00:24:26.828 --> 00:24:27.870
I mean, it's not really romantic.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:28.703
That's what they do.

00:24:28.703 --> 00:24:30.930
They sell other things, as well,

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:31.950
but they're slavers.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:34.050
And so when they go from
the north to the south,

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:35.310
they are enslaving people

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:37.620
as they go down and they're trading.

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:38.700
Now, I probably told you this already,

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:42.900
but the Vikings, although
they were marvelous seamen,

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.060
could not actually deal with the rapids.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:45.893
I told you this, right?

00:24:45.893 --> 00:24:47.040
They couldn't actually
deal with the rapids

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:47.873
of the Dnipro.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:50.070
So how did they pass them?

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:51.920
They made the slaves carry the boats.

00:24:53.045 --> 00:24:54.990
And at their places where they failed

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:57.000
to ride the rapids,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.030
they left runic markers
of the Vikings who died,

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:01.803
some of which we still have, right?

00:25:03.177 --> 00:25:04.500
The first people who could
actually deal, to my knowledge,

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.360
with the rapids are the Cossacks,

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.193
who we're gonna get to.

00:25:07.193 --> 00:25:08.610
Don't worry, we'll get to them six

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.320
or seven centuries down the line.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.153
Okay.

00:25:12.528 --> 00:25:14.370
So we have many of the pieces here.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:16.080
We have the Franks, we have the Byzantines

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.820
and we have the Vikings, who have to do

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.820
with both the Franks and the Byzantines.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.170
What we also need

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:25.110
are the other Slavic states.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:27.630
So, as I said before,
every state is gonna tell

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:31.290
a story about how it
emerged from nothing, right?

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:32.430
It emerged from nothing.

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.980
Our people came from a
mysterious place over the sea.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.750
You know, there was a
city on a hill, whatever.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.460
Like, our people came from nothing.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:39.870
That's how it always starts.

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:40.800
There's a blank slate.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.750
There were our people. It's wonderful.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.030
In fact, there's always
a tremendous amount

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:46.800
of copying, which is very awkward

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.790
for the national legends,

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.320
but very important for history.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.990
So the state that emerges in Kyiv

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:53.820
could not have come into existence.

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:55.950
Again, we're talking about
possibility, not necessity.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.330
Could not have come into existence

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:00.480
without Moravia and without Bulgaria.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.430
Okay. What's Moravia?

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:04.860
Moravia is so hugely important

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:09.030
because Moravia was
the first Slavic state.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:10.800
It's the first one we know about.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.120
Early 9th century.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.880
The first mention of it is in 822.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.590
Quite a long time ago.

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:20.760
Moravia is where the Czech
Republic is now, roughly.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.640
And it was heavily under the influence

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.263
of the Franks.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.470
To make a long story short,

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:30.120
and I've mentioned this before,

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.630
Moravia sets up the classic
geopolitical situation,

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:36.660
which is, okay, you're
a little Slavic state.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.830
You have to be Christian.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:38.850
Why do you have to be Christian?

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.313
Because you need to be recognized, right?

00:26:42.647 --> 00:26:44.430
If Islam had come further north.

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:47.220
And remember, of like from
the point of view of 822,

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.720
this almost happened, right?

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.820
If Islam had come further north,

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.160
then you could be
recognized by Muslim states,

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.450
and that would also have worked,

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.120
but that just barely didn't happen.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.610
And because it just barely didn't happen,

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:01.530
the states you wanna be
recognized are the ones

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:03.210
that are around you, namely
the Christian states,

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:04.440
namely the Franks.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.273
Okay.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.590
The Moravians are heavily
under the influence

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:11.490
of the Franks.

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:14.763
Their ruler, who's a man called Rostislav,

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.570
Rostislav does the natural thing,

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:22.950
which is he sends an embassy to Byzantium.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.300
By the way, it's only very recently

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:25.830
that embassies are buildings.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:27.510
It used to be that embassies were people

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:30.030
who were sent with missions,

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.260
with diplomatic missions.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.650
So they sent an embassy to Byzantium.

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:36.360
Why? To balance.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.220
And this is the story everywhere.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.320
Maybe you have to be Christian,

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.780
but you wanna get the
best deal possible, right?

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:44.640
If you didn't wanna get
the best deal possible,

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.133
you would be a terrible
ruler of your people.

00:27:48.402 --> 00:27:49.620
You'd be a terrible power calculator.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.590
And it's this conjuncture, this rivalry

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:54.570
between the Franks and the Byzantines

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:56.880
in Moravia, which generates the mission

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.273
of those two gentlemen who
we mentioned before, namely.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.675
What was their names again?

00:28:02.675 --> 00:28:03.930
- Cyril and Methodius.
- Cyril and Methodius.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:06.311
Right, Cyril and Methodius.

00:28:06.311 --> 00:28:09.780
So Cyril and Methodius
are Slavs, probably,

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.850
and they are Slavs who create

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:14.130
a written language for other Slavs.

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:16.740
That is another huge breakthrough

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.140
and also an act of
human creativity, right?

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.740
It's an act of human creativity,

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.360
the importance of which lasts right down

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.300
to the present day.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.180
If they had made it up differently,

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.010
any little thing they had done differently

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.080
would have meant an entirely
different cultural history

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.580
for all of our region, right?

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.410
At this point, these two men

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:36.510
are the ones who lay it down.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:38.460
Now, they're laying it down for a purpose.

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.410
They're translating parts of the Bible.

00:28:41.474 --> 00:28:43.110
They're missionaries.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:44.580
There's a distinct
reason why they're doing

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:45.540
what they're doing,

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:47.400
but they're the ones who lay down

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.360
a Slavic written language,

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.400
which we now call Church Slavonic

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.770
or Old Church Slavonic.

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:54.630
They're the ones who make, in principle,

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:55.590
the Bible accessible

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:59.520
for a much larger group of people.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.000
Okay, so this mission

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.450
to Moravia fails,

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:07.800
as missions will,

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.080
but it has two long-term consequences,

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.490
which I want you to note.

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:15.600
The first consequence of
its failure is Poland.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.670
So this is not a course in Polish history,

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:19.290
but as it will become clear over time,

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.300
you can't really do
Ukraine without Poland.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.940
And a very important
thing to know about Poland

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:27.030
is that it is a Western Christian country.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:30.150
So why is Poland a
Western Christian country?

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:31.590
It's a Western Christian country

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.030
because of the Czechs,

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:35.100
because the Czechs got there first.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.800
The Czechs were a Western
Christian country.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.800
In Poland, just like in other
Eastern European countries,

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.723
there is Old Church Slavonic.

00:29:44.951 --> 00:29:45.784
There is a Polish declension

00:29:47.662 --> 00:29:48.660
of Old Church Slavonic.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.490
It was not fated that Poland was gonna

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.170
be a Western Christian country,

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:53.610
but it became one

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:55.530
when a Polish ruler married a Czech

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:56.670
who was already a Christian,

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:58.080
and that leads to conversion.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.410
So that's a consequence
of the failure in Moravia.

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:03.030
So the Czechs, but also the Poles,

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:05.850
are Western Christians,
and they still are, right?

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:07.500
That's the way it's gonna be.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.970
The other consequence of this failure

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:11.010
is that the followers
of Cyril and Methodius

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:13.470
have to run, as one does.

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:15.150
They and their students

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:18.420
end up in Bulgaria.

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.430
And it's in Bulgaria

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:24.240
where the Glagolitic script,

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.740
which Cyril and Methodius invented,

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.810
was shifted over to a Cyrillic script,

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:32.280
which is much easier to read

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.380
and which is basically the alphabet

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.480
that, you know, a bunch
of people in this room

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.600
were educated to learn when
they were in kindergarten,

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.800
with some minor changes.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.140
So by the time Cyrillic
script was created,

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:49.140
which is around the year 893,

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.760
we now have an availability

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.900
of an alphabet and a language

00:30:53.916 --> 00:30:55.410
for other states.

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:59.040
The most important one of
these states is Bulgaria.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.590
Again, Bulgaria, not our subject.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:03.570
I couldn't personally do a
whole semester on Bulgaria,

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:06.209
but one could do a whole
semester on Bulgaria.

00:31:06.209 --> 00:31:07.459
It's a fascinating place.

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.380
Who were the Bulgars?

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.240
I know that when you woke up this morning,

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.110
you were thinking,

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:16.050
I hope Professor Snyder
gets to this question

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:17.340
of who were the Bulgars.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.690
I know this has been troubling you.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:21.903
And it is authentically confusing.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.380
The Bulgars are a Turkic people,

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:28.440
some of whom stayed in what's now

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.990
kind of south-central Russia

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.300
and converted to Islam.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.280
So there are Turkic people

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:38.130
who stay in Russia, become Muslim.

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:40.260
And just, if we were doing
the history of Russia,

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:41.310
and we'll do a little history of Russia,

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:42.180
this is very important.

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:44.010
A lotta the territory
of Russia is inhabited

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:45.873
by people who are Muslim.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.930
When I was in Ukraine last week,

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:52.280
I was talking to a woman who had,

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.390
in Chernihiv oblast, who
had five Russian soldiers

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:55.860
in her basement.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.530
And, of course, none of them
were from European Russia.

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:01.020
And two of them, I think, were Muslims.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.220
That's Russia, right?

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.440
Russia has been a Muslim country

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.630
from the get-go, among other things.

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:08.850
But some of the Bulgars, okay,

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:10.360
some of the Bulgars migrate

00:32:12.254 --> 00:32:14.340
and come to dominate part of the Balkans.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.100
And they seem to convert to Christianity

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.570
around the year 865.

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:21.630
And that's the prehistory
of the Bulgarian nation

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.700
that we know and love today.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:27.420
And the Bulgarian found a state

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.760
which is Orthodox,

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.350
Eastern Christian, that is,

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:33.870
but which is in rivalry with Byzantium.

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:36.510
And that's a very important model, right?

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:39.750
That you can be Orthodox and Christian,

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.880
but not be actually part

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.640
of the Byzantine Empire.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.080
That's a model of statehood.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.670
Very important, right?

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:49.140
The Bulgarian get there first.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.940
And part of the way they get there

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:54.150
is that they use the legacy
of Cyril and Methodius.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:55.830
They use Old Church Slavonic.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:58.630
They develop, you know, a
slightly national version

00:32:59.494 --> 00:33:01.350
of Eastern Christianity,

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:05.070
but they're also creating
a model of statehood.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:06.483
Okay, by the way,

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:09.930
you've probably been
wondering like, you know,

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:11.760
the Russian president's name is Vladimir,

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.470
and the Ukrainian president's
name is Volodymyr.

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:15.360
So like is Volodymyr a Ukrainian name

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.280
or is it a Russian name?

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.710
It's a Bulgarian name. (laughs)

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:21.360
It's a Bulgarian name.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.400
The Volodymyr who's gonna
convert to Christianity

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.450
at the end of this lecture,

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:27.060
his name was actually a Bulgarian name.

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.700
It's a cultural borrowing from Bulgaria.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.350
Copying is really important.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:32.790
It's much more important than we think.

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:35.250
Okay, this brings us to the special case

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:36.870
that we're gonna land on,

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:38.820
which is the case of the Rus'.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.560
And when we talk about the Rus'

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.240
and the creation of Kyivan Rus',

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.210
we need to now know who
the local competitors

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:46.410
for power are.

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:48.480
The local competitors for power

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.910
in the 8th, 9th and 10th century here

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:53.910
are the Rus', who we've
talked about a little bit,

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:55.620
these Scandinavian slavers who come down

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:59.126
from the Baltic Sea, and the Khazars.

00:33:59.126 --> 00:34:01.412
The Khazars are already present,

00:34:01.412 --> 00:34:04.173
and the Rus' are on their way down.

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.270
So let's talk first about the Rus',

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:10.930
and then let's talk about the Khazars.

00:34:10.930 --> 00:34:14.310
Okay, so some of you have
asked me about names,

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:16.260
and it is very, I mean,

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.340
names are very powerful.

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.830
What we name things does
have a certain power,

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:21.840
and there's a tendency to say

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:23.160
what something is named now,

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:26.340
it must reveal something
essential about it.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.600
And, you know, we all have names

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.100
and like we're called by our names,

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.233
and it runs very deep.

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:34.230
But one has to be a
little careful about this.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.810
So like America is called America,

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:40.480
but we're not all Italian mapmakers

00:34:43.668 --> 00:34:45.180
and so on and so on and so on, right?

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:48.273
But we still unproblematically
call ourselves America.

00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:52.440
Rossiya, Russia is called Russia

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.177
as a reference to Rus',

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.840
but Rus' is itself the
name of a Scandinavian,

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.700
probably a Scandinavian trading company.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.743
In any event, a group of Vikings.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.800
So, and the reason they were called Rus',

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.970
no one is quite sure.

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:07.830
It's close to a Finnish word

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:09.513
which means rudder.

00:35:11.588 --> 00:35:13.050
So our best guess is that modern Russia

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:14.760
is named after an old Finnish word

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.830
for our rudder, right?

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:18.120
But that doesn't mean that the Russians

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:21.300
are actually medieval Finnish rudders.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.240
So the name that something has now

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.260
and like working it back

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:28.260
doesn't actually have any
magical quality, right?

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.540
So, you know, why Belarus
is called Belarus,

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.370
or Ukraine is called
Ukraine, is interesting,

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:35.760
but it doesn't necessarily
reveal anything essential

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.990
about the country.

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.823
Okay.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.673
Right.

00:35:40.673 --> 00:35:43.290
So that's the Rus'.

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:44.790
So what do we know about them?

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:49.830
As I said, they're seeking
a trade route south.

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:51.450
The first mention we have of them

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:52.440
in our part of the world

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:56.220
is in the 840s, 850s, 860s.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.080
They're mentioned as Scandinavians

00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.700
engaged in the slave trade

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.590
in order to gain silver.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:03.570
As I mentioned before, we
have these silver hoards,

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:06.379
which is part of the evidence

00:36:06.379 --> 00:36:07.629
for what they were doing.

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:11.160
They are still nomads, right?

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.240
They're marine nomads.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.670
They move mainly by
sea, but they're nomads.

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:17.733
And one of the big
underlying transitions here,

00:36:18.893 --> 00:36:20.793
I've emphasized it in terms of slavery

00:36:22.744 --> 00:36:24.330
versus peasantry, right?

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:25.500
But another way to think about this

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.680
is nomadism versus settlement.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.020
When the people in power are still moving,

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.460
that's one situation.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.290
When the people in power settle

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:36.570
and build cities, or take
over someone else's cities,

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:38.070
that's a different situation.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:40.620
So what the Vikings did

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:44.280
was they overwhelmed
sedentary civilizations.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.960
They took cities.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.180
They negotiated trade
terms, which is what you do.

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:49.593
That's just normal.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.760
What's special is that they
end up settling in Kyiv,

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.620
and that's when we get a state,

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.850
and I'll talk about that.

00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:59.040
So as I mentioned, they tried

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.720
to go down the Volga River,

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.950
which is in the middle of Russia.

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:04.710
They were blocked by the Bulgars,

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:05.760
the Muslim Bulgars.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.160
And then they went down the Dnipro.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.270
And went down the Dnipro,

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:12.270
then we're setting up
the history where we are.

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:15.360
The people who dominated Kyiv and Ukraine

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.300
at the time were the Khazars.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.760
The Khazars are tough to figure out.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.920
We have no written documents at all

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.650
that are directly from their state.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:29.400
It was a multiethnic and
multi-confessional realm,

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.320
which had some Christians and some Jews

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.794
and some Muslims in it, but also had lots

00:37:34.794 --> 00:37:37.590
of non-monotheistic believers

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:39.930
in it as well.

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:42.270
The Khazars came to an end in a way

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:45.540
which is also incredibly confusing.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.760
There was rivalry among
the various monotheisms

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.980
about which monotheism
they all converted to.

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:52.470
And it's actually not clear
they converted to any of them.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:53.790
There's a beautiful novel, though,

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:55.620
about this called "The
Dictionary of the Khazars"

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.813
by a Croatian writer called Pavic,

00:37:59.837 --> 00:38:00.937
which I don't know if you like read

00:38:00.937 --> 00:38:02.730
"Choose Your Own Adventure"
stories as a kid,

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:04.770
but it's like, it's a novel,

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:06.450
which is set up as three dictionaries,

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:07.510
a Christian, a Jewish

00:38:08.358 --> 00:38:10.320
and a Muslim, where you kind of choose

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.390
like in what order you read it.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.410
It's very beautiful.

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:15.630
But it gets across the
kind of lack of narrative

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:17.190
that we actually have about the Khazars.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:18.723
We have very little.

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:22.740
Oh, Cyril visited them.

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:23.730
That's interesting,

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:26.700
Cyril, our same Cyril who went to Moravia,

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:30.300
also visited Khazaria in 860,

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:32.580
in order to try to spread Christianity.

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:36.960
So we know that they weakened

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.720
and we know that they faded into,

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.020
married into the Rus' in some way.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.750
We know this partly because of language.

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:47.760
When the Rus' settle down and start

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.023
to try to rule Kyiv,

00:38:50.092 --> 00:38:52.773
they called their leader a khagan,

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:55.380
and that's a Turkic word, right?

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:57.630
That's a word that they
got from the Khazars.

00:38:58.835 --> 00:39:01.110
Their ruler is first called a khagan.

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:01.943
Okay.

00:39:03.832 --> 00:39:07.290
So the Rus' are settling into Kyiv,

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:10.140
late 800s, early 900s.

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.003
We know they dominate Podil.

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:17.073
That's the part of Kyiv
from which you would trade.

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.397
We know they dominate, they control Kyiv

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:25.230
by about the year 900.

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:28.410
They're basically taking over
what the Khazars left them.

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:30.000
They're taking tribute from the people

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.610
who used to be paying the Khazars tribute.

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:34.050
That's a sign of who's in charge

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:36.090
that historians can follow pretty well,

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:37.410
is who's getting the tribute, right?

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:40.233
Who can make other people
regularly pay money.

00:39:41.533 --> 00:39:45.660
By 911, a ruler of the Rus', called Oleg,

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:48.510
is signing a treaty with Byzantium, right?

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.640
They're reaching Byzantium,
but not with violence.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.250
They're now reaching
Byzantium with diplomacy.

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:55.320
But you can tell that they're still,

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.340
they're not just traders.

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:57.840
They're people who are feared.

00:39:59.215 --> 00:40:01.080
A provision of this treaty with Byzantium

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.750
is that the Rus' are only
allowed to go through

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:05.820
one gate of the city, a specified gate,

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.160
and they can't come in more
than 50 at a time, right?

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.140
So there's a sense that
perhaps these people,

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:11.940
you know, might cause a
certain amount of trouble

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:14.640
if you just let them
come in in large numbers.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.473
Okay.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.080
To put this back into perspective,

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.700
we're getting towards the year 1000.

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.470
I'm gonna deliver the promised conversion

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:24.270
of Volodymyr before this is all over.

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:26.460
But I want you to notice that in this time

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.530
in the 900s, the 10th century,

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:31.680
this is the time of a lot of
other conversions as well.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:32.860
This is the time

00:40:35.096 --> 00:40:36.990
when the Vikings in Scandinavia

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:39.120
are starting to move towards establishing

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.480
the Danish and the Swedish
and the Norwegian states,

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.870
which are also associated

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:47.013
with Christian conversions.

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.670
The 10th century is a time

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:52.440
when the Vikings are settling down

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.170
and founding states everywhere,

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:56.430
including in continental Europe.

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:58.680
So in 911, the same year of this treaty,

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.650
is when Charles the Simple of France

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:04.170
grants Duke Rollo, who's a descendant

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:06.690
of the Vikings, Normandy.

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:07.860
Normandy being Northern France.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:09.420
Normandy also being the launching point

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:12.180
for the Normans, who then
control Great Britain.

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:14.280
So this is a time of Viking conversion,

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.620
a time of Viking state creation.

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:19.110
Our story is special
because it's taking place

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:20.880
amidst different kinds of people,

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.200
amidst the Khazars.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.420
It's taking place with
different kinds of models,

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:25.650
the Slavic models.

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:27.540
And fundamentally,
because it's taking place

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.070
at a time when there was a choice

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:32.490
between two different
versions of Christianity.

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:34.053
The first time. Okay.

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:36.093
When you convert.

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:39.543
The story always goes, you convert.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.910
You believe it.

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:43.170
All of your people convert.

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:45.300
It's like everything (snaps
fingers) changes all at once.

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.220
That's not how it happens.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:51.420
Olga, who rules from 945 to 962,

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.210
does convert, but her kids don't convert

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:55.800
and her grandchildren don't convert,

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.810
and her people don't really convert.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:00.453
She converts to Eastern Christianity,

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.270
but then she asks for
some German missionaries

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:05.790
to come a couple of years later.

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:09.510
Her son, Sviatoslav,
which is a great name,

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:12.003
still borne by many lovable people.

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:17.100
Sviatoslav rules from 962 to 972.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:18.210
He's a pagan.

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:19.290
Her kid is a pagan.

00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:20.970
We have few sources about why,

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:23.130
but I really like one of them,

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:24.810
where he basically says,

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:27.135
he's asked why he can't
convert to Christianity,

00:42:27.135 --> 00:42:28.237
and he says, "Well, like my crew

00:42:28.237 --> 00:42:31.015
"would all make fun of me." (laughs)

00:42:31.015 --> 00:42:33.061
(students laugh)

00:42:33.061 --> 00:42:34.890
And that is kind of what Sviatoslav did.

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:36.900
He, in the 960s,

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.760
he seems to have destroyed the remnants

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.050
of the Khazar state.

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:42.360
And then in the late 960s, early 970s,

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.010
he campaigned in the Balkans

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:48.870
to try to gain control of
the Balkans, and failed.

00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:49.890
When he was leaving,

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:51.690
this is one of the reasons
we know he was a pagan,

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:54.150
in 971, he invoked

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:56.970
two Slavic pagan gods, Perun,

00:42:56.970 --> 00:43:00.060
who's the god of thunder, and Veles,

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.610
who is the god of the
earth and of the harvest.

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:05.310
And by the way, in the Slavic mythology,

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:06.960
which is kind of like the Scandinavians

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.460
are clearly influencing it.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:10.667
But in the Slavic
mythology, Perun and Veles

00:43:10.667 --> 00:43:12.330
are in this kind of embrace,

00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:15.424
where you explain the
change of the seasons

00:43:15.424 --> 00:43:16.950
by battles between the sky,

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:19.620
which is Perun, and the
earth, which is Veles.

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:22.053
It's actually kind of beautiful. Okay.

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:25.950
So in 972, on his way back,

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:27.750
Sviatoslav is killed

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:31.530
on the Dnipro by Pechenegs,

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:33.240
who make a cup from his skull,

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.013
as one did in the time and place.

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:40.200
So that leaves us open.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:43.170
There's then a very complicated
succession struggle,

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:44.790
at the end of which

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:48.120
the person who comes
to power is Volodymyr,

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:49.980
who's remembered as Volodymyr the Great,

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:52.770
who is the person who actually converts.

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:54.420
So I'm gonna read you the passage

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:57.930
from a primary source, which
is the "Primary Chronicle."

00:43:57.930 --> 00:43:59.640
It's from about 100 years later.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:00.750
The story goes like this.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:02.430
This is after the fact.

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:03.990
It's 100 years after the fact.

00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:05.790
So just think about, I mean,

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:08.250
how reliable a source
100 years after the fact

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:09.513
is generally going to be.

00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:12.840
It sketches things out in a way

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.010
that makes them seem plausible,

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:15.150
but it's kind of more revealing

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:16.560
about how things look in retrospect,

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.580
but it's still fun to read.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:18.413
Okay.

00:44:18.413 --> 00:44:22.560
So this is about how you make
a choice for Christianity,

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:25.290
and it aestheticizes it and
makes it all very clear.

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:28.350
The Bulgars, means the Muslims, right?

00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:29.940
The Bulgars bow down and sit

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:31.080
and look hither and dither,

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.370
and there is no joy among them,

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:34.260
but only a dreadful stench.

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.540
Their religion is not good.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.310
Then we went to the Germans,

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:40.140
the Western Christians, the Franks.

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:41.760
Then we went to the
Germans, and we saw them

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.950
celebrating many services
in their churches,

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:45.960
but we saw no beauty there, right?

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.510
Eternal complaint about
Germans and their churches.

00:44:50.537 --> 00:44:52.050
Then we went to the
Greeks, the Byzantines.

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:53.250
Then we went to the Greeks,

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:55.230
and they led us to the place
where they worship God,

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:56.810
and we knew not whether we
were on heaven or Earth, right?

00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:57.930
So it's all very clear.

00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:59.580
It's all very aestheticized.

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:01.290
But having gotten this far in the class,

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:04.011
you know that it has to
do with other things.

00:45:04.011 --> 00:45:05.220
It's gonna have to do with power.

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:06.120
It's gonna have to do with the choices

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.950
of a particular ruler.

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:11.373
Volodymyr himself, no particular
religious preferences.

00:45:12.311 --> 00:45:14.820
Maybe flirted with Islam
at one stage in his life.

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:18.000
Certainly tolerant of,
encouraging of pagan worship

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.810
in Kyiv when he took power in Kyiv in 980.

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:25.050
We know that Perun, the god
of thunder, was worshiped.

00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:27.660
What he had was an opportunity,

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:28.980
and he took it.

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:30.690
The great power in the south,

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:33.423
the Byzantines, were in internal turmoil.

00:45:36.303 --> 00:45:38.310
There was a rebel who sought to take power

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:39.780
from the Byzantine emperor,

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.760
and Volodymyr threw the power of Rus'

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.810
on the side of the Byzantine emperor

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:48.270
and helped to win, helped
the Byzantine emperor

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:50.850
to preserve power in a campaign in,

00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:52.233
you guessed it, Crimea.

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:56.857
So Volodymyr, having done this, then says,

00:45:56.857 --> 00:45:58.867
"I would now like to marry

00:45:58.867 --> 00:46:00.030
"the sister of the emperor,"

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:02.310
which is a big ask, but the circumstances

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:03.310
were what they were.

00:46:04.162 --> 00:46:06.907
And the Byzantines
answered, not surprisingly,

00:46:06.907 --> 00:46:09.097
"Yes, but there's a little proviso,

00:46:09.097 --> 00:46:11.853
"which is that you must
convert to Christianity," okay?

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:16.560
It's a little power play,

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.960
the Rus' helped the Byzantine ruler,

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.550
but then there's the larger power play,

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:22.500
which is happening all
over Eastern Europe,

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:25.350
which is that one or the
other of these large states

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:26.670
is eventually gonna get you to convert

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:28.530
to its version of Christianity.

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:31.740
This time, the conversion sticks.

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.180
There's a permanent link now

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:35.760
between Byzantium and Rus'.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.520
Rus' soldiers remain in Constantinople

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.560
as an imperial guard.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.790
The Byzantine emperor

00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:45.570
sends Greek-speaking churchman to Kyiv.

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:48.090
Churches are built, most
famously Saint Sophia,

00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:50.820
which still stands in the center of Kyiv,

00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:52.260
in all of its beauty.

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:55.680
Volodymyr ensures that the
population of Kyiv converts.

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.140
Idols and temples that
he himself had raised,

00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:59.670
or allowed to be built, he destroys,

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:02.880
has thrown into the river.

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:03.903
And as a result,

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.800
Rus' becomes part of the Byzantine world,

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.350
and in a couple of ways,

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:13.230
part of the classical world.

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:15.150
One way is continuity.

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:17.790
The continuity of Greece, Rome,

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:20.277
Byzantium and Rus'.

00:47:23.012 --> 00:47:24.720
That's one way.

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.340
But the other way

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:29.310
is that Rus' is now going

00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:33.033
to extend territorially northwards,

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:35.130
this classical civilization,

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:36.720
which had never gotten so far north.

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:39.420
Which is, it's a big part of the history

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:41.760
of the Slavs in general, of
Eastern Europe in general,

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.100
is that, sure, there are these models

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:45.420
that come from the south,

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.730
and now they are going further north,

00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:49.440
which brings me to Serhii Plokhy.

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.940
So we've been doing this little derby

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:54.600
about whether there are
any other lecture classes

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:57.000
on Ukraine in the United
States of America.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.530
And so far, this is the only one,

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:00.300
but alert people have pointed out

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:02.070
that there's like, in
some provincial university

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:05.133
in Boston area, there is actually one,

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:08.100
but it starts in 1500.

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:09.480
So I'm gonna say that we're still

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.040
the only survey lecture class,

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.660
because we're five lectures in,

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:15.540
and we're not even close
to 1500 yet, right?

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:16.980
So we're still five centuries,

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:18.540
five good centuries away.

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:19.830
But in all seriousness, that class

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:21.390
is taught by Serhii Plokhy,

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:23.400
who is a giant among historians of Ukraine

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.860
and Ukrainian historians,
and who is the author

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:27.480
of the book that you're
reading "Gates of Europe."

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:30.600
And he makes the very
important geographical point,

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.490
which I hope you've been following,

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:34.590
about how the creation of Ukraine

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:36.213
is not about east and west.

00:48:37.089 --> 00:48:38.670
That's a much later point of view.

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:40.650
But about south to north.

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:43.440
It's about south to
north, and north to south,

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:44.970
where south to north has to do

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:47.790
with the ancient world, the Greeks,

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:50.790
the Byzantines, the Black Sea,

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:52.710
and the northern coast of the Black Sea,

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:56.190
and things moving up towards Kyiv.

00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:58.710
And now the north to south has to do

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:00.900
with the Vikings.

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:04.530
They're moving down the Dnipro
River, seeking Byzantium.

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:06.240
And the Kyivan state, you know,

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.520
putting it very grandly,
is a kind of encounter

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.870
of a movement from north to south,

00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:11.940
and another movement from south to north,

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:13.620
which meet each other in the city

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.360
which already existed and was dominated

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.390
at the time by the Khazars.

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:20.700
Okay, so that's gotten us

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:22.500
as far as I thought we could get.

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:24.270
Volodymyr has converted.

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:26.640
The state of Kyivan Rus' has been founded.

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:28.620
A state in the sense that
it will be recognized

00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:29.790
by other states.

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:31.230
A state in the sense that it belongs

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:33.750
to a monotheistic religion, Christianity,

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:35.490
the Eastern version,
which will be recognized

00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:36.750
by other Christians.

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:38.970
A state in the sense
that it has a language,

00:49:38.970 --> 00:49:42.210
a written language, and people
who are literate to use it.

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:43.860
A state in the sense that it is building,

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:45.870
and a state in the sense
that it's gonna recognize

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:47.910
its subjects, which we're
going to talk about.

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:49.320
The weakness of the system,

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.340
which I'm just gonna leave you with,

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:51.630
because it's important,

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:53.700
the weakness of this system.

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:54.690
And it's important, also,

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:56.820
when you think about the heritage of Rus'

00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:59.730
and people who claim the
heritage of Rus' today,

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:02.370
the weakness of the system was
the principle of succession,

00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:04.380
or the absence of a
principle of succession.

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:05.880
There was no idea that, for example,

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:08.430
the oldest son would inherit
or anything like that.

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:11.250
Basically, parts of Rus' were given out

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:12.840
to various sons,

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.420
and there tended to be lots of sons.

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:18.090
Volodymyr managed to keep
seven different districts

00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:20.403
under his control by wit,

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:23.490
but it wasn't simple, this
business of having sons.

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:24.810
So just to keep this in perspective,

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:28.260
before he married Anna,
his most famous wife.

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:30.690
She was not the only one, I'm afraid.

00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:31.950
There were about half a dozen others.

00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:34.200
But before he married Anna,

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:35.520
the sister of the Byzantine emperor,

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:38.250
he already had 800 concubines.

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:39.083
Presumably, he didn't mention that

00:50:39.083 --> 00:50:41.130
to the Byzantine emperor, nor
would the Byzantine emperor

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:42.780
have been impressed by the number.

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:44.070
I mean, just for the record,

00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:44.903
but
(students laughs)

00:50:44.903 --> 00:50:47.970
that gives you a sense of
the succession problems

00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:48.810
that you might have.

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:51.450
There are going to be a
lot of male offspring.

00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:53.070
And when the father is weak

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:55.200
or the father leaves the scene,

00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:56.430
there's gonna be competition.

00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:59.430
So next time, we're gonna
start talking about law

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:01.680
and how this state
recognized its citizens,

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:04.020
and how the state found a particular,

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:05.640
citizen subjects, how the state found

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.260
a particular way to do so,

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:10.380
which then becomes a legacy
that goes on for centuries.

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:12.450
But in this tradition of law,

00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:14.550
the weak point was succession.

00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:16.440
The weak point was how the state

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.870
actually reproduces itself over time.

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:19.890
We'll talk more about that.

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:20.790
All right. Thanks.

00:51:24.208 --> 00:51:26.958
(soothing music)

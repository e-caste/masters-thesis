00:00:00.201 --> 00:00:03.118
(foreboding music)

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.840
- Okay. Greetings, everyone.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.530
One of the things you learn
when you become a historian

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.250
is that most of the great quotations

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.460
that people cite were never
actually said by the person.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.190
So, and the internet
has only made this worse

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.580
because the internet filters
for what sounds right,

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.740
and what sounds right is very difficult

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.410
from what a specific person actually said

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.420
at the specific time.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.300
So, if you track down, like
the 100 most quoted things,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.000
especially by people
like Einstein in general,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.610
they didn't ever actually
say those things.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.220
Somebody said they said those
things, it sounded right.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.770
So the example I'm thinking of,

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.560
I don't think Stalin ever actually said

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.010
that a million lives is a statistic,

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.990
and one life is a tragedy,

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.230
or a million deaths is a
statistic, one death's a tragedy.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.600
He's quoted to that effect all the time,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.940
but I have never actually seen the source

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.450
where Stalin says that,
the primary source,

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.640
and this is by the way,
this is how historians work,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.040
is that we are always working our way back

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.330
towards the primary sources

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.790
and then building our
way back up to stories.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.420
So if I, like everything
that I tell you here

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.430
is the product of,

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.690
almost everything is the product

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.020
of somebody else's research at some time

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.580
in some archive,

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.230
finding things out, making new arguments,

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.840
working it into a book, right?

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.673
So the things that,

00:01:37.673 --> 00:01:39.000
the things that I'm trying
to present to you here

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.020
is general arguments,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.230
are the result of the work of
an awful lot of historians,

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.420
generally Ukrainian historians.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.160
And then we try to make it all make sense

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.750
in a big class.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.120
But the reason I'm thinking about this

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.360
is the difficulty of the subject today.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.240
So our subject today is
the death by starvation,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.400
or malnutrition,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.710
or hunger-related disease

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.270
of about 4 million people

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.370
in the Soviet Republic of Ukraine

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.510
between the middle of
1932 and the end of 1933.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.850
One of the worst manmade
famines in modern history,

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.683
at least,

00:02:15.683 --> 00:02:18.750
and a turning point in
history of the Soviet Union.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.570
But it's inherently hard to think about.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.403
It's,

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.610
even the number 4 million
is hard to think about.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.903
But then also,

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.980
unless you've had very specific
kinds of life experiences,

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.870
the idea of one person starving to death

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.380
is also very difficult
to think about, right?

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.770
And so the combination of
those things, 1 million person,

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.370
one person starving to
death, but 4 million times,

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.930
4 million different people.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.030
So it's a very hard
reality to try to imbibe,

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.017
but I'm not asking you to imbibe
it now, as I speak to you,

00:02:50.017 --> 00:02:52.260
you know, just for a couple of minutes,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.300
I'm just trying to give you a sense that

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.000
there are certain kinds of subjects that,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
you know, as humanists,
we don't just blur over.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.250
As scientists, we go
to the primary sources,

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.960
and we check those quotations,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.970
and we work our way up to arguments.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.790
But as humanists, we have to
be attentive to human life

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.020
and the meaning of human life

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.210
and the way that human life ends.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.800
And this is largely a lecture about

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.963
how human life ends.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.350
I'm gonna begin it with
an authentic quotation

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.130
from the period, from January of 1933.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.560
I'll tell you where it came
from a little bit later.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.643
The quotation is,

00:03:27.847 --> 00:03:30.150
"There are villages in
which a significant part

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.730
of the adult population
has left for the towns

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.350
to seek money and bread,

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.660
leaving the children alone to their fate.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.450
In many villages, the
tremendous majority of kholkoz,'

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.047
that's collective farm workers,

00:03:41.047 --> 00:03:42.930
"and their families are starving.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.850
And among them are many
who are sick and swollen

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.350
as a result of hunger.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.240
And a series of cases
no help is given them

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.730
since there are no reserves whatsoever.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.110
in connection with this,
many people die every day."

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.800
So that is not from,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.730
a letter from a Ukrainian
to a family member abroad.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.790
It's not from a Ukrainian

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.790
talking to another Ukrainian in Ukraine.

00:04:08.936 --> 00:04:11.400
It's actually from a report,

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.100
it's a handwritten note
appended to a report

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.000
to the head of the
secret police in Ukraine.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.680
The authorities in Ukraine knew
exactly what was happening.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.760
They were there watching it,

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.780
they were there carrying it out,

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.860
they were there talking about it,

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.690
reporting on it to one another.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.090
It's a handwritten
appendage to the report,

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.490
because it's not essential.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.870
The lives of the people concerned,

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.240
the deaths are not really essential.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.300
It's not important to the
overall five-year plan

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.460
collectivization, the Soviet project.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.373
It's just noted, so it will be known.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.850
Which leads me to the first point

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.710
that I want you to understand,

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.660
which I'm sure many of you do,

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.270
it's that famines are political.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.390
Very rarely do you confront a situation

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.730
where a famine is a direct result

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.860
of a physical lack of food.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.860
It's the result of a political
decision about distribution,

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.030
which is based upon priorities,

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.370
where the priority of
preserving human life

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.780
may be very low,

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.780
or as in this case, it
may not exist at all.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.350
It may not be a priority.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.423
And so, if famines are political,

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.450
then you know, that opens one's eyes

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.450
to the possibility of how
famines can be created

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.130
in the present or in the future, right?

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.420
So if, for example, a country
invades another country

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.260
and blockades its ports

00:05:36.338 --> 00:05:38.610
and says that food will
not pass from these ports

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.900
out into the rest of the world,

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.240
that is not a lack of food, right?

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.910
It's not that Ukraine right
now isn't growing food,

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.680
it's that a political
decision has been made

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.900
to try to block the export of that food.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.473
And therefore, in the
Sahel, or in Ethiopia,

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.160
or in Lebanon, there
might be food shortages

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.370
as a result of political decisions, okay.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.203
So,

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.200
from the point of view of the Soviets,

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.073
the decision to have people
starve in Soviet Ukraine,

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.070
we see it as political, right?

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.903
From their point of view,

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.040
what they think is that

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.720
everything should be yielding to politics.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.920
So this is, I mean,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.140
I'm gonna get into the
details, and the backdrop,

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.460
and all the arguments about this,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.170
but there are a few fundamental
things to understand

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.900
about the way Soviet
leaders understood the world

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.480
in the early 1930s that are crucial here.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.433
One is the Leninist idea that
everything yields to politics.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.950
That an elite party, a
small group of people

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.310
with the right ideas
can push history forward

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.080
in the right direction.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.900
That there's a natural direction
that history is moving,

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.490
it's moving towards socialism,

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.770
it's moving toward the
domination of the proletariat,

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.100
and the right people can push it forward.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.720
And as they push it forward,

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.810
everything else has to
yield because we know

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.310
that this is the correct
way that history has to go.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.960
Within this worldview,

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.050
it's very important to
see that the individuals

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:17.700
who actually exist in the
world do not have any value.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.100
So, you know, you might have been exposed

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.110
to some sort of human rights framework

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.310
or civil rights framework,

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.470
or you might think that
that's natural, right?

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.720
All these things are
historically contingent,

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.130
and we learn them or unlearn them,

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.540
take them in or not,

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.550
in this way of seeing the world,

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.710
an any individual, any
particular individual,

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.150
doesn't really matter.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.740
Because what matters is,

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.080
where we're all going to get together.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.050
Not necessarily us even,
but some future generation.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.740
At some point, humanity is
going to be restored to itself.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.480
Alienation's gonna come to an end,

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.220
private property is gonna come to an end,

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.840
that's everything, right?

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.070
That is everything.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.663
The goal is everything.

00:07:56.879 --> 00:08:00.750
And means are generally justified.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.770
And this has,

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.720
this has another implication for truth,

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.880
which is really important when
we talk about this famine.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.580
So this famine is one of
the blunter bigger truths

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.830
of the 20th century in European history,

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.960
but nevertheless, extremely controversial,

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.160
at least for decades,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.200
and one of the reasons for that,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.030
is that the people who carried it out,

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.220
had a specific idea about truth.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.390
And their specific idea about truth

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:24.870
is that just as these
individuals don't matter,

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.860
also the facts as such, don't matter.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.170
They matter selectively

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:34.500
insofar as they can
help a narrative, right?

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.000
That's what facts are for.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.890
But facts as such are not so interesting.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.480
And the narrative has a shape,

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.520
and it's the shape of history
that I've described before,

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.590
which is that there's a revolution,

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:44.760
the revolution is going to bring,

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.340
eventually going to
bring about human harmony

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.570
and solidarity.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.270
That overall shape is what matters.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:55.380
And if it so happens that
millions of people die

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.520
along the way,

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.340
those individual facts are less important

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.840
than the overall shape.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.520
In fact, if we have to,

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.160
if those individual
facts amount to something

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.660
that we can't ignore,

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.940
which is what happened in 1932 and 1933,

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.260
the scale of the famine was so great,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.730
it couldn't really be ignored,

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:15.900
then you have to argue that
this was necessary, right?

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.930
So at the Congress of Victors,

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.570
the Party Congress of 1934,

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.710
the argument that was made
to great success and fanfare,

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.840
was that the famine in Ukraine

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.000
was part of breaking the back

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.920
of the international Bourgeoisie

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.860
by way of its Polish agents,

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.870
and its Ukrainian nationalists,

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.310
that the very,

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:41.580
all of the pain and suffering
actually demonstrates

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.100
that the revolution has been successful.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.660
And that's a form of argument,

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.580
which I'm sure is not
entirely unknown to you.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.860
The idea that precisely
because there was pain,

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.270
it was therefore,

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.650
it was therefore worth it,

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.590
but on a grand scale.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.350
And then related to this,

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.210
again, before we get into the details,

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.940
one has to remember that
if you are a Bolshevik

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.463
in the 1920s and 1930s,

00:10:04.463 --> 00:10:07.260
you are taking for granted
that whole groups of people

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.233
who exist on the earth
will soon not exist anyway.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.910
So, you know, you shouldn't
be caring about individuals,

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.770
you should be caring about
the future proletariat.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:18.990
But in caring about
the future proletariat,

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.660
you have to understand that the peasants,

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.330
for example, are going to cease to exist.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.340
That's just the way history works.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.460
And so if they cease to
exist a few years earlier

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.970
or a few years later, that's
not your fault, right?

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.230
It doesn't really mean anything,

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.840
whether they cease to exist
at one point or another.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.580
So it, so this is, I mean,

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.140
it's hard to get these things across now

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.050
because, you know, there
are some capitalists

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.820
who have this kind of confidence

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.140
about the way the world works,

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.730
but there's nobody on the left anymore

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:48.780
who has this kind of confidence

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:49.830
about how the way the world works,

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.320
so it's hard to sort of think
your way back into this,

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.870
but if you are sure that
the world works this way,

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.970
and has to work this way
and should work this way,

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.340
then the conclusion that, you know,

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.100
yes, the peasantry is
doomed, I know it's doomed.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.480
Science says it's doomed.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.190
This is the way history has to work,

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:06.570
then you're going to look differently

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.060
upon the deaths of millions of peasants

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.140
than you would otherwise,

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.140
because that group was
doomed anyway, as you see it.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.330
It's not you, you're not
exercising the agency,

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.520
history was gonna move in this direction,

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.013
You know, you're just playing your part.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.630
So those are just, those are
general things to keep in mind.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:29.380
The second thing that I wanna
get across is the background

00:11:30.395 --> 00:11:31.770
of the 1920s.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.020
So one way to think about the famine

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.037
is the way that I've just given you,

00:11:35.037 --> 00:11:38.890
you know, let's see the
world a little bit the way

00:11:39.763 --> 00:11:41.363
a Bolshevik leader might see it.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.190
Taking a step downwards,

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:45.330
a little bit less abstract,

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.600
another way to see the
famine is as a contrast

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.350
from the 1920s to the 1930s.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.540
So the Soviets, after
the revolution of 1917,

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.150
were trying to do something in the 1920s,

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.120
which didn't quite work
out the way they expected.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.173
And that leads to harsh
repressive policies in the 1930s.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.350
Or,

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:11.460
in the 1920s, the Soviets
were taking a kind of pause

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.600
from a revolution,

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.940
which they always knew
they had to carry out,

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.380
by the end of the 1920s,

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.210
they knew that they had to carry it out.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:19.800
And that revolution,

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.540
the economic part of the revolution

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.520
is what brought collectivization,

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.700
the end of private
agriculture, and famine.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.850
So I want you to think now
about this kind of contrast

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.060
between the 1920s and the 1930s.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.180
The trick to the Bolshevik
revolution in 1917,

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.980
as I mentioned to you before,

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.640
is that it was never meant
to be a Russian revolution.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.420
It only became a Russian
revolution in retrospect

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.670
after it failed to be a world revolution.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.350
And that sets up the tension,

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.150
which is inside this revolution,

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.420
and indeed inside this state,
from the very beginning.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.950
It was, the idea was,

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:58.290
we are going to set off
the powder keg in Russia,

00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.820
the rest of the world will join in,

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.340
and then the rest of the
world will help us take care

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.930
of the rest of the revolution.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:06.840
Because let's face it,

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.660
the political part is
the easiest part, right?

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.170
Transforming the political
system, overthrowing a regime,

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.240
is easier under almost any circumstances

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.310
than transforming an entire economy.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:18.390
It involves fewer people,

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.420
you can take advantage of
war, and so on, and so forth.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.190
So you have a world
revolution, which doesn't help,

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:24.450
which doesn't happen.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:29.450
And you have then the need
for socialism in one country.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.790
So how do you build
socialism in one country

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.440
to take the slogan?

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.273
How do you,

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:37.650
now that there's not a world revolution,

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.960
how do you carry out your own blueprint

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.980
on the scale of the Soviet Union?

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.050
So there are a few parts to this.

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.750
One part of this is you
barricade yourself off

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:49.680
from the rest of the world.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.170
So the Soviet Union, as
of the Treaty of Riga,

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.180
is is a state with borders,

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.770
and as we're gonna see over
the course of this lecture,

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.240
these borders will become stronger,

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.440
and stronger, and stronger,

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.870
one way to do this is to
not let the outside in,

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.970
not let the bourgeois world corrupt you,

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.073
not let in all the spies and the wreckers.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.030
The second thing that you do is that,

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:12.210
you take advantage of the
scale of your own country.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.167
So the Soviet Union was not,

00:14:14.167 --> 00:14:16.230
you know, the Azore Islands,

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.610
it was not, you know,

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.950
the Soviet Union covered,

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.990
you know, a sixth of the earth,

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.840
the Soviet Union was the
largest country on the planet.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.130
And so when you look at the Soviet Union,

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.100
you can say, well, some
of these places are,

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.680
will be like the colonial periphery,

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.720
and some, it'll be more like
the Metropolitan Center.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.580
That's not the way they usually
talked about themselves,

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.413
I should caution you,

00:14:36.413 --> 00:14:39.030
because that's the capitalist
way of talking about things.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.550
But Stalin occasionally did forget himself

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:42.780
and say things like,

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.580
What we have to do is carry out a policy

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.070
of internal colonization.

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.440
The French and the British, says Stalin,

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.540
have far-flung maritime colonies

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:52.373
that they can exploit,

00:14:52.373 --> 00:14:55.050
we don't have that, but we
do have all of this landmass.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.180
And so we can exploit parts of it

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.000
to industrialize other parts of it.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.650
So you don't have the whole world anymore,

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.810
but you do have a very big country

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.790
with more and less developed parts,

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:09.600
and you can exploit the
less developed parts.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.877
And then the third thing that you can do

00:15:11.877 --> 00:15:14.010
is that you can make a play for time.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:16.890
So the play for time is the 1920s.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:21.060
The play for time is
the New Economic Policy,

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.430
the trick of which in Ukraine,

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.650
to make it very, you know,
to simplify a little bit,

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:29.460
is that Ukrainian peasants
get to keep the land

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.010
they took from Polish landlords, right?

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:33.600
That was their revolution.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.400
Where Ukrainian peasants get to keep land

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.640
that somehow they ended up
with after the revolution.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.980
The revolution didn't
make that happen directly,

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.860
like, no Bolshevik in
Petersburg made that happen,

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.240
but it happened.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.280
And they get to keep the land now.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.460
And of course, they're pleased with that.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:54.780
The second way you buy time
is the national question.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.800
You're aware that there
is a Ukrainian nation,

00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.640
as I think I've said before,

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.540
this kind of odd difference
between the 1920s and the 2020s,

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.530
is even the Bolsheviks,

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:05.550
I mean, even the most, you know,

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.173
radical, ruthless,

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.830
doctrine error internationalist,

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:11.663
of the early 1920s,

00:16:11.663 --> 00:16:13.980
like, they were aware that
there was some Ukraine there

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.330
that they had to somehow deal with,

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.470
they disagreed with how they're gonna,

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.780
but they were aware that it was there.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.550
And then weirdly, 100 years on,

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.440
when Ukraine is much more clearly there,

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.720
it's existence is denied.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.160
But so you try to buy time
with the national question.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.560
And this was not, I mean,
this is an interesting policy,

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.970
and it didn't happen just in Ukraine.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:36.723
I mean, around the Soviet
Union, it was called like,

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:40.800
"Korenizatsiya," like rooting,

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.537
in Ukraine, It was usually
called, "Ukrainizatsiya,"

00:16:43.537 --> 00:16:44.940
"Ukrainizing."

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.230
The idea was,

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.630
yeah, maybe the nations are hostile to us,

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:49.470
or they don't know,

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:50.880
or they don't see the benefit.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.550
But what we will do is we will give them

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.040
a kind of capitalist stage of development.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.200
We're giving the peasant a
capitalist stage of development,

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.150
we're gonna let them keep
the land, they'll like that.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:03.030
We're gonna give the
nationally-minded elites

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.320
a capitalist stage of development,

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.735
because we're gonna give
them university education,

00:17:07.735 --> 00:17:09.990
we're gonna give them
jobs in the bureaucracy.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.450
They're gonna have social advancement,

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:13.980
you know, they're gonna
move from the countryside

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.170
into the cities, right?

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.270
Ukrainian writer, Valerian Pidmohylny

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.400
wrote a whole novel about this.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.750
So, we're gonna give them

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.480
the capitalist stage of
development, basically.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.680
'Cause remember, the whole scheme here

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.810
is that the Soviet Union
has to find its way

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:29.370
on its own to socialism.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.950
So this has a kind of coherence.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:35.400
So in the 1920s, inside Soviet Ukraine,

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.400
you have affirmative action for Ukrainians

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.880
as against Russians and Jews, chiefly,

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.650
the Ukrainians moving
in from the countryside

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.873
to the cities up, up through the ranks,

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:50.880
and then you also have
a very sophisticated,

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.150
very interesting movement
in Ukrainian culture.

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.243
Just to name one person, if I
can name, I'll just name one,

00:17:58.419 --> 00:18:02.760
which is, Mykola Khvylovy, who
was from the Kharkiv region.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.650
Again, remember, like in general,

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.630
the Ukrainian nation comes from the east,

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:07.800
that's kind of the default.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.903
He comes from Kharkiv, the Kharkiv region,

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:14.760
a little town, Trostyanets, I think.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.933
In the Kharkiv region.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.200
I should never say like, "I
think," in front of the camera,

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.360
'cause now like there will
be a million Ukrainians,

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.000
did Khvylovy become from a
place called Trostyanets or not?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.580
And is one of my TFs,
checking that online right now

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.520
as we speak, perhaps, yes.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.440
So I can be corrected in real time.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.380
Anyway, but the point about Khvylovy

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.080
is that he was a wonderful writer,

00:18:37.473 --> 00:18:39.360
he was in charge of a series
of literary organizations

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.010
who carried out, or was
in the center of something

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:42.510
called the Literary Discussion,

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.550
which was about what is the orientation

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.080
of Ukrainian literature gonna be?

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.210
World literature, European literature,

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:49.650
Western literature,

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.450
Khvylovy's big thing for which he later,

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.190
as you can imagine, got
in trouble was that,

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.110
it shouldn't have a colonial relationship

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.450
to Russian literature, right?

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:00.330
It should be a literature on its own.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.700
The second major figure of this period,

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.720
whose name is on your sheet,

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.580
is Mykola Skrypnyk,

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.790
who was a fairly orthodox
Bolshevik in most respects,

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.490
but who took the Ukrainian
question more seriously.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:16.490
He was the commissar for
education from 1927 to 1929.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.140
He was from Bakhmut, which is,

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.220
you might have heard that name,

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.140
just because it's where
there's a lot of engagement

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.080
between Ukrainian army
and Russian mercenaries

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.220
from Wagner right now,

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.990
that's where a big part of the front is,

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.270
in Donetsk, Bakhmut.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:34.200
So in the 1920s, there was a play for time

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.460
with the national question,

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.850
and the idea was, if we
make our version of Ukraine,

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.010
that will bring people into the system,

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.870
and they will be loyal,

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.330
and then also it will
make Ukraine attractive

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:46.680
to those Ukrainians in Poland,

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.970
who you remember from the last lecture,

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:49.830
those five or 6 million
people who had reasons

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:53.970
to be often disenchanted
with Poland. Okay?

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:54.803
The problem with this play for time

00:19:54.803 --> 00:19:57.043
is that this play for time
had to come to an end.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:01.470
And it had to come to an
end as the Bolshevik saw it,

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.240
in a certain way,

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.790
which was with the
collectivization of agriculture.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.660
You know, it's, again,
it's hard to get yourself

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.670
into this mindset
because I realize the way

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.650
that we see things a
century later is different.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:14.483
But,

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:17.940
if you really think that history's on it,

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.080
actually, it's not so different.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.490
Like there are a lot of people after,

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.870
I mean, this is a kind of loose analogy,

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:23.400
but just stay with me for a second.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.110
There are a lot of people after 1989

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:27.630
who thought that absolutely, for sure,

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.370
capitalism was gonna lead to democracy.

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:30.960
Like, 100%, we know it,

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.520
Like, that's the way it's gonna work.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.070
That's a little, that's
of course, not true.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.500
I mean, as an empirical
matter, just not true.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.030
It's been a great century for capitalism,

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.950
but not so much for democracy.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:41.790
If you've, you know,

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:43.590
like I'm talking about
like your lifetimes,

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.870
or since you got out of
kindergarten, basically.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.160
Since you got outta kindergarten,

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.780
democracy has been going down.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.894
Coincidence? I ask you, right?

00:20:50.894 --> 00:20:51.930
(students laugh)

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:56.130
So that, like, but if you've
ever been in that groove

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:57.180
where people say that

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.830
like, a certain kind of economics

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.930
has to lead to a certain kind of politics.

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:04.470
That will help you see what they thought,

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:05.303
which is that,

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.610
there was one form of
capitalist development

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.733
and they had to get through
it at an accelerated rate.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.360
And so, and they could
not imagine any other way

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.900
to do that besides extracting
from the countryside,

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.250
and building up in the cities,

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.410
building the factories,
building the mines.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:26.010
And the way to do that was
to collectivize agriculture

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:26.843
as they saw it.

00:21:26.843 --> 00:21:28.680
Again, they couldn't think
of any other way to do it.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.620
And by the way, like these
things which seem inevitable,

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.000
although they're not,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.020
I mean, you could have gotten,

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.030
Ukrainian agriculture would've
been much more profitable

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.520
had it never been
collectivized, obviously,

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.870
they could have taxed probably,

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:41.370
and made more money from it.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:42.990
But, you know, the things which,

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:44.580
things seem inevitable and happened

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.770
because people think they're
inevitable then become models.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.600
So just a little excursus here,

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.000
the whole Chinese
Revolution does not happen

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.880
in the form that it happens
without the Soviet Revolution,

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.110
And that the whole idea

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:56.520
that you have to collectivize agriculture

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.840
as a form of development,

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.160
that wouldn't have happened in China

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.960
without the Soviet model.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.030
And likewise, without the famine

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.410
that we're talking about here,

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:05.910
there wouldn't have been a similar famine,

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:07.710
although on a much greater scale in China,

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.360
a couple of decades later on.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.770
Okay, close excursus.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:11.603
So,

00:22:13.465 --> 00:22:16.687
the only argument at the
top of the Soviet state was,

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.060
at what time to do this, and how quickly.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.160
And this is a very interesting juncture

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.740
because in the second half of the 1920s,

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.450
after Lenin is dead,

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:30.300
and Stalin and others
are jockeying for power,

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.780
Stalin shows the intimate relationship

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.770
between bureaucratic politics

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.180
and theories of everything, right?

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.620
Because what,

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:41.453
we don't have this anymore,

00:22:41.453 --> 00:22:42.570
we just have bureaucratic politics,

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:43.860
we don't have theories
of everything, right?

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.110
That's why everything seems so blah.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.390
But so when Stalin is arguing,

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:49.263
what he says is,

00:22:50.407 --> 00:22:52.200
"You know, these comrades,

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.800
these comrades are saying that, you know,

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.833
that collectivization
should happen too soon.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.530
And these colleagues or
these comrades are saying

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.690
it should happen too late, right?

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.750
And I'm right in the middle,
I've got it just right."

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.400
And so this is an argument about

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.230
who is the best scientist of history

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:13.080
because it has to be done
in exactly the right way.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.430
But in fact, what he's doing is,

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.170
he's getting rid of some rivals,

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.090
and then getting rid of some other rivals,

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:20.310
defining himself as being in the middle,

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:23.493
which is, that is how this
kind of politics works.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.480
The party is supposed
to represent history.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.353
So okay, here,

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.720
the sequence would be,

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.960
there's history, which
brings you the proletariat,

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.150
and the proletariat brings you the party,

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:38.250
and the party brings you
the central committee,

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.470
and the central committee
brings you the politburo.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:42.450
And then the politburo is then dominated

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:45.240
by one individual or occasionally
a small group, right?

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.270
And so the who gets to
be that one individual

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:49.860
is then determined by these,

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.750
like, who is the best
at these kinds of games,

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:52.920
which was Stalin.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.650
But the way you make the argument is,

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:56.490
we're talking all,

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:58.440
and you believe it
probably to some degree.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.810
You're talking about the whole
development of human history,

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:03.660
and who is right about how
to advance human history.

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.903
Those are the terms in
which the argument is made.

00:24:07.373 --> 00:24:10.290
So Stalin on the argument
of collectivization,

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:11.760
manages to consolidate power.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.590
And this is very important because,

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.000
and there's nothing solely about this,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.970
this is just normal politics,
normal tyrannical politics.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:21.330
Once you're attached to a
policy that is disastrous,

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:23.013
what do you do? Right?

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.500
You don't say it's disastrous,

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.560
you say, actually it's the
triumph of human history

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.300
and civilization, and so on, and so forth.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.830
It had to be this bad.

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:34.950
So the fact that this is
Stalin's signature policy

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:35.820
is very important.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.830
This is the policy on which
he rides to the top position

00:24:39.968 --> 00:24:40.801
in the Soviet,

00:24:40.801 --> 00:24:43.950
in the party, and therefore
in the Soviet state.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:48.950
But collectivization as
such, doesn't go very well.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:51.010
They start off slowly in '28, '29,

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:54.090
in early 1930, they race
forward in a couple months,

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:57.750
in early 19, in early, sorry, early 1930,

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.460
they collectivize,

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:00.750
at least according to
their own statistics,

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.550
about half the country.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:03.930
And that led to, as we saw before,

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:05.133
a lot of resistance.

00:25:07.306 --> 00:25:09.360
In Ukraine, you had a
million acts of resistance

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.560
recorded in this period,

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.500
you had whole villages walking
towards the Polish border,

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.580
trying to leave,

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.568
a lot of resistance,
including armed resistance

00:25:16.568 --> 00:25:19.380
and attacks on party members.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.940
As we saw before,

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.047
it's in March where Stalin gives this

00:25:23.047 --> 00:25:24.450
"Dizzy With Success" speech,

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:26.820
it's in March of 30 when the Red Army

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.230
is placed in full battle readiness

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:33.120
on the western front for
fear of a Polish attack.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.890
But there is no Polish attack, right?

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:36.990
There is no Polish attack,

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:38.310
as we saw last time,

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.987
the Poles react to the
five-year plan by saying,

00:25:40.987 --> 00:25:43.917
"Wow, the Soviets state is
stronger than we thought."

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:49.320
When the Soviets propose
peace talks, they accept,

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.730
there's a draft of the treaty

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:53.610
between Poland and the Soviet
Union in August of 1931,

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:57.600
the treaty is signed in July of 1932.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.810
I mention this again because
it's gonna be important

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:02.910
for how the famine is discussed.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:04.980
And so now I'm gonna
let you in on a secret

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.963
about how totalitarians do things.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:13.790
it's really smart to talk about threats,

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.430
which you have already resolved, right?

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:20.760
You don't talk about a threat
which is actually a threat,

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.320
because a threat which
is actually a threat

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.370
is a problem for you,

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:25.590
which you don't wanna have
out there in the world.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:29.130
But talking about threats
that you've just resolved

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:32.730
is very helpful because they're
under your control already,

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:35.190
and so they only exist discursively.

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:37.110
So that's stuff that we talked
about in the last lecture,

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:38.190
The Volhynia Experiment,

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:39.390
the spies going across the borders,

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:40.650
that was all very real.

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:44.340
But by the end of 1931,

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.570
latest early 1932,

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:46.770
that had all been taken care of,

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:48.330
those people had gently been arrested.

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.790
The Soviets were running more
spies in the other direction,

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.580
they were not afraid of Poland,
they signed a peace treaty.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.020
That was pretty much done for,

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.950
I mention all of this because
when the famine comes,

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.260
what is Stalin going to blame it on?

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.200
He's not gonna blame it
on a real threat, right?

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.450
You don't talk about real threats

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.670
because real threats are
actually out of your control.

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.080
You talk about fake threats,

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.130
or you talk about threats

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:14.250
that you've already mastered
because then they become,

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.460
at least you think ,purely
under your control.

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.160
Although, and this is now not a trick,

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.900
but a reality of totalitarian systems,

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.010
but not only.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:27.570
Once you inject a very big
lie into the system like that,

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:28.920
like for example,

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.350
that the Polish nationalists
and the Polish spies

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.910
are ultimately behind the famine,

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:34.980
once you get that into the system,

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.290
and people live and die on that lie,

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:39.690
that lie can then take on
a life of its own, right?

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:41.970
As we're gonna get to by the end.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.493
Okay, so how does the famine happen?

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:48.120
Partly, the famine happens
because of expectations.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.233
1930 was a very good crop,

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.200
the requisitions targets for the next year

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.050
were therefore set very high.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:01.650
And 1931 agricultural conditions, weather,

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.030
was all worse,

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:05.940
and most of the farms have
by then been collectivized,

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:08.130
and collective agriculture
just doesn't work

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:09.570
as well as private agriculture,

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.280
especially in the transition year,

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.410
when you're doing it for the first time.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.450
So the famine begins in late '31

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:18.420
as the peasants refused
to surrender grain.

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.730
Local party activists in Ukraine,

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:23.040
completely, truthfully report up the ranks

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.810
that there is famine, there are shortages,

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:27.300
they ask that requisitions targets be,

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.420
so requisition is when you
take grain away, right?

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.020
They ask that the requisitions
targets be decreased.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:36.390
At this point,

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:40.440
the crucial thing is
interpretation, right?

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.250
And here we get to a big
irony about these systems,

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:49.250
which is that they end up
relying on personal explanations.

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:54.060
So the irony of that is that supposedly,

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.920
Marxism-Leninism is a science, right?

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.320
It's a science of society,
a science of history.

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:02.760
But then if something doesn't go your way,

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.120
doesn't go the way you predicted,
who do you have to blame?

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.210
You can't blame yourself, you
can't really blame science,

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:10.170
you can't blame the method

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:11.820
because that would call
Marxism into question,

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.740
and therefore, your legitimacy.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:18.120
So you have to somehow imagine
that particular individuals

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.220
have almost superhuman powers.

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:21.840
And this happens over
and over and over again,

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.910
those categories that I
mentioned half-ironically earlier

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:25.533
of like the spy and the wrecker,

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.673
certain individuals turn
out to have, you know,

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.010
in order to explain these things,

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:34.713
extraordinary, extraordinary power.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:37.710
You might catch this in
things that seem like

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.480
conspiracy theories, right?

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.313
Or the notion,

00:29:40.313 --> 00:29:43.170
you know, that people are
crossing borders, right?

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:45.870
Or that one or two spies inside the party

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:46.830
can make a whole system.

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:49.380
You see this there examples all over,

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.480
but in the show trials later on,

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.710
when like people would confess

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:54.453
to doing a whole range
of impossible things

00:29:54.453 --> 00:29:57.060
that you have to be a super-villain to do,

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.340
to be both a Nazi and a
Zionist at the same time.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.173
You know, these,

00:30:00.173 --> 00:30:02.160
and then, or you know, when Khrushchev

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.960
says that the whole problem
with the Stalin period

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.280
was Stalin himself.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.960
Like even that's not true, right?

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.760
Even Stalin is not responsible

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.730
for all the problems of
the Stalin period, right?

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:13.860
And so the way the system
deals with things going wrong

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:15.450
is actually, ironically,

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:19.410
to give superpowers to evil individuals

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:21.450
and to call them names, and so on.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:22.680
So I'm pressing that point home

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.080
because this is the way
that Stalin handles in 1932,

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.150
the famine in 1932.

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:29.910
He says that like it's
somebody's fault, right?

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:31.650
So it starts with,

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:33.480
it's the Ukrainian party's fault,

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.680
they've gotta work harder.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.360
They're not going out
there to get the food,

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.840
but it's the fault of the
individuals in the party.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.370
Stalin says they have to be held,

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:46.140
I'm quoting from July 1932,
"Personally responsible."

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:50.310
So this is, you know, this
is detached from reality.

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:51.600
They're doing the best they can,

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.120
but they're an impossible situation.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:58.140
He then moves from there to the reason why

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.330
these individuals in Ukraine

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:01.710
are not doing what they should do.

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:04.890
And the reason why they're
not doing what they should do

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:05.723
is Poland.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.390
It's that they're corrupted
by Ukrainian nationalists,

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:11.880
and Ukrainian nationalists
are in turn running,

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.620
you know, they're being
run from the Polish state,

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.667
and actually, Pilsudski
is in the back of it,

00:31:15.667 --> 00:31:18.190
you know, with his
hands on the marionettes

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.013
running everything.

00:31:20.013 --> 00:31:21.330
Which, you know,

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:22.560
in "Sketches From A Secret War,"

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.570
I make the point, this would've
been news to Pilsudski,

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:25.680
because at this time,

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.480
the Poles were not really
able to do anything

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.680
that they wanted to do in Soviet Ukraine,

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.570
and they were appalled and confused

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:32.820
by the spectacle of the
starvation that they saw

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.013
in 1932 and 1933,

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:39.240
In August of '32, Stalin
writes an important letter

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.830
to his,

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:43.260
to one of the two other important members

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:46.290
in the politburo, Molotov and Kaganovich,

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:49.680
Stalin referred to them
as "Our ruling group."

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.233
He wrote to Kaganovich,
his trusted collaborator,

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:54.720
and the great thing about
this period, by the way,

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.460
is that people still wrote letters.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.020
So,

00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:58.853
alright, I won't,

00:31:58.853 --> 00:32:00.270
I don't have time to wax nostalgic

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:02.130
about the 1930s and the typewriters,

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:04.207
but Stalin wrote to Kaganovich,

00:32:04.207 --> 00:32:05.760
"The chief thing now is Ukraine.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.990
Things in Ukraine are terrible,

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:08.610
it's terrible in the party,

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:10.620
they say that in two Ukrainian Oblast,

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.930
I believe, Kyiv and Dnipropetrovsk,

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.850
that around 50 Raikom may have spoken out

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:16.440
against the grain requisitions plans

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.880
considering unrealistic.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.713
In other Raikom,"

00:32:18.713 --> 00:32:21.457
meaning, local regional party commissions.

00:32:21.457 --> 00:32:23.940
"It appears situation's no
better, what's this like?

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.590
It's not a party, but a parliament,

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:27.060
a caricature of a parliament.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.100
It's terrible in the Soviet organs,

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.090
Chubar is not a leader,

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:33.187
It's terrible in the GPU," secret police.

00:32:33.187 --> 00:32:34.650
"And Redens is not leading,

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.690
is not up to leading the
fight with counterrevolution

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:38.700
in such a large and unique
republic as Ukraine,

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.230
If we don't make an effort now to improve

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:42.720
the situation in Ukraine,
we may lose Ukraine.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.670
Keep in mind that Pilsudki
is not daydreaming,

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:46.800
and his agents in Ukraine
are many times stronger

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.480
than Redens or Kosior think,

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.917
keep in mind that
Ukrainian Communist party,

00:32:49.917 --> 00:32:52.620
500,000 members, haha,

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.110
even includes a few, yes, not a few,

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:56.610
not a few rotten elements,

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:58.500
conscious and non-conscious Petlurites

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.450
as well as direct agents of Pilsudski.

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:01.740
As soon as things get worse,

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:02.790
these elements will not be slow

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:04.560
in opening a front within
and without the party,

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.670
against the party."

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:08.820
So this is Stalin's
personalist interpretation.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.260
It's Ukrainian party members,

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.330
so it's not the laws of history,
and of course it's not him,

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:14.040
it's not the policy of collectivization,

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.650
it is that these guys are deliberately

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:21.650
sabotaging the harvest in
order to break Ukraine off

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.310
from the Soviet Union.

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:26.910
Now, this interpretation is very important

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:27.870
because it's not,

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:29.993
I mean, it's not,

00:33:29.993 --> 00:33:34.380
it's not everyday reality
which drives policies, right?

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.640
It's, and this is true in any system,

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.560
it's the elite interpretation

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.600
that's going to drive policies.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.010
And in a system like this one

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:42.420
where there is no, like,

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.880
there's no not much
feedback to the politburo,

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.020
the feedback to the politburo

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.660
would've been local
party secretaries, right?

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.490
And that feedback has been cut off

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:52.800
because Stalin says we can't trust them.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.170
They're precisely the people
who didn't take responsibility.

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:57.420
They're the ones who're the
agents of Pilsudski, right?

00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.253
We can't trust them.

00:33:58.253 --> 00:33:59.130
So now there's no way,

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:01.740
there's no informational feedback
to the top of the system.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.590
This interpretation is
what's going to drive policy.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:06.930
And the policy, I broke
this up into seven,

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:08.580
It's on the other side of your notes.

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:12.570
There are seven specific
policies which I think,

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:15.720
clearly authorize us to characterize this

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.490
as a political famine.

00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:19.860
Seven particular things that happen

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:23.490
in just a few weeks in
late 1932 and early 1933,

00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:26.220
which mean that rather than

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:28.410
a few hundred thousand people dying,

00:34:28.410 --> 00:34:29.460
which was at this point,

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.950
like in late fall of
'32, is still possible,

00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:33.990
4 million people die.

00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:36.510
Again, these are political choices

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:38.340
about what to do with available food.

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.950
During this time, the
Soviets had food reserves,

00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:43.140
during this time, the
Soviets were exporting food,

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:46.020
they were exporting food
from ports in Soviet Ukraine

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:47.070
at this time.

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:48.780
People could have been fed
from the food that was,

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.550
it's not that there was a lack of food,

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:53.310
it's a decision about how
you treat particular people.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:55.563
So this cluster of policies,

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:59.340
it's kind of extraordinary
condensation of things

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:02.640
that happen from the end of November 1932

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.793
to the end of January 1933.

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.933
At the first is the
return of grain advances,

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:12.753
this meant that,

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:17.733
if you had met your grain
requisitions targets that year,

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.580
you were then given some grain back

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.953
to live on and to plant for the next year.

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:27.240
In November of 32, this was reverse,

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.600
which meant that suddenly,
everybody was vulnerable.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.590
But also, you have to think about

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:32.670
what this means in practice,

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:34.530
which is a hard thing to convey.

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:37.053
The famine is being carried out by,

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.020
by local party members,

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.840
local state officials, policemen,

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:46.050
enthusiastic university
students coming back,

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:47.850
people who believed in the revolution,

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:48.960
coming back to their villages,

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.490
sometimes their very own villages,

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:52.140
it's being carried out by people.

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.440
The food is being physically
taken away by people.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.780
So every one of these
measures, or most of them,

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.330
it involves people rushing to the village,

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:01.860
rushing to a collective farm

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.780
with the authorization
to take things away,

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.150
and in practice, this often
just meant taking everything.

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.400
Right? Just taking everything.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.323
Second measure is the meat penalty.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:12.513
it's 20 November,

00:36:14.009 --> 00:36:15.513
if you didn't make the quota,

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:20.340
then you had to pay your tax in meat.

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:23.490
And so if any of you have
any kind of rural background,

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:24.360
do you understand what that means?

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:27.000
Like, if you are living on a farm,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.390
the goat or the cow is
the kind of last resort,

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:31.650
so you'll slaughter that goat

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:33.810
or you'll slaughter
that cow if you have to,

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:34.650
but in the meantime,

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:35.997
you're gonna take the
milk, but if you have to,

00:36:35.997 --> 00:36:38.610
you have that meat that might
get you through the winter.

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:41.190
Everyone, so all of
these collective farms,

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.380
villages that couldn't make the quotas

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.063
then had to turn in their goats,

00:36:46.354 --> 00:36:47.253
or their cows.

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:52.087
Just to quote a peasant girl
from "Bloodlands," who says,

00:36:52.087 --> 00:36:55.140
"Whoever had a cow didn't starve." Right?

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.280
It's a kind of basic,

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.430
but then they lost
their cows in late 1932.

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:03.333
Third specific policy, the
blacklists of 28 November,

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.063
according to the blacklist,

00:37:07.318 --> 00:37:09.120
if you hadn't met your target,

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.600
then you had to surrender
15 times as much grain,

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.010
which of course is impossible,

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:18.510
and was a complete
authorization of all the party

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:20.340
and state forces to come and take

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.470
literally whatever was there.

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:25.170
The blacklists also meant
that you were cut off

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:26.550
from the rest of the Soviet economy,

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:28.290
so it was illegal for you to exchange

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:30.240
in any kind of way with any part

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.670
of the rest of the Soviet economy.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.860
Number four is maybe the most diffuse,

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:36.180
but it's incredibly important.

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:39.603
It's the national
interpretation of the famine.

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:43.590
And this has to do with this
character of Vsevolod Balyts'kyi,

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:46.650
who was the head of the
state police in Ukraine

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:48.270
at this time.

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:50.370
And at this time, later it was different,

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:52.590
but this time, quite close to Stalin

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:56.220
and had personal conversations
with Stalin about all this.

00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:00.000
He comes back to Ukraine
in December with a message,

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.200
that Ukrainization has been
carried out in the wrong way,

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.040
right?

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.800
Ukrainization has been carried
out on in the wrong way,

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.272
Ukrainization has
promoted the wrong people,

00:38:10.272 --> 00:38:13.200
Ukrainization has been dangerous,

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.033
and there are a bunch of,

00:38:14.033 --> 00:38:16.170
so there are a bunch of
details involved with this.

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:19.770
Like party commissions now
come from outside of Ukraine

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:20.880
to run the party.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.940
Stalin sends in about a hundred
of his own trusted people

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:26.520
from the outside to run the party.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.083
But the gist of it is that,

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:33.870
now, if you are in favor of Ukrainization,

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:35.520
you're in danger,

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.680
but also if you're not being enthusiastic

00:38:39.609 --> 00:38:41.820
about requisitioning the grain,

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.920
you'll be called a Ukrainian nationalist,

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.080
and then you'll be sent
to a concentration camp.

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.580
Or perhaps worse, right?

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.580
So this whole, a right-wing nationalist

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.650
deviation is being defined.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:54.540
And the method which every party member

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:55.800
would've understood was,

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.950
if you don't go through with
requisitioning the grain,

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:00.930
even in these conditions,

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:03.360
you will yourself be punished personally,

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.960
and you will likely be sent
to a concentration camp.

00:39:07.067 --> 00:39:08.617
That was a standard punishment.

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.043
And you know, this.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.510
and then with this, with
the whole plot that like,

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:17.400
also the Ukrainian communists are informed

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:21.630
that many of them are in
fact, secretly Polish agents,

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:23.730
there's the Ukrainian
military organization,

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:26.520
which is run by the Polish
military organization,

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.897
the Ukrainian military
organization doesn't exist.

00:39:27.897 --> 00:39:30.690
The Polish military organization
hasn't existenced since 1921,

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:34.293
but Balyts'kyi, who was a
very creative individual,

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:37.470
explained the existence
of all of these groups.

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:38.580
So right around,

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:42.170
so that's December-January '32, '33,

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:45.030
at this point, about 1
million people are dead.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:46.440
But this interpretation,

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:50.160
which says the you and the
party will be punished.

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.150
That's one of the big things,

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:54.033
which turns it from 1
million into about 4 million.

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:57.900
Fifth measure, 20 December, 1932

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:01.380
is the affirmation of
the existing grain quota.

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:04.920
So they could have reduced the quota,

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.840
nothing in the scheme of things,

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.010
that wouldn't have meant anything

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:10.680
except that fewer
Ukrainians would've died.

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.690
Maybe they would've exported
a little bit less grain.

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:15.030
They could have reduced
the quota, they didn't,

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:17.250
they forced it upon the protesting

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:21.960
Ukrainian party leadership
in late December 1932.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.570
Number six, January of '33,

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:27.810
the peasants were banned
from going to the cities.

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:30.120
This is an unusual situation.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.580
In general in a famine, or in any, like,

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:36.480
let's say there's a food
shortage caused by bad weather.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.060
You wanna be in the countryside, right?

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.740
It's always better in those situations,

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:41.700
almost always,

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:45.330
to be a farmer than it
is to be in the city.

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:46.710
But this famine was different

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:48.540
because the state had taken total control

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.460
over the countryside and
had been very successful

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.200
in extracting food from the countryside,

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.790
so you actually had this unusual situation

00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:57.033
where peasants were fleeing
to cities to beg for food.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:02.340
Or peasants, and this
happened over and over again.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:05.760
Peasants would send their
children to the cities to beg,

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.663
to beg for food.

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:08.670
Thinking that that was the only chance

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:10.290
their children had of surviving.

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:11.850
So as of the middle of January,

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:14.910
peasants were banned from doing this.

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:17.163
And then at the end of
January, 22nd January,

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:20.470
the Ukrainian Republic of the Soviet Union

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:26.610
was separated from its
neighbors, Belarus and Russia,

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:30.060
it became illegal to leave
the Ukrainian Republic.

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.190
So again, a natural response to hunger

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:34.290
is to go somewhere else.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:37.290
This blocking, the internal
board of the Soviet Union,

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:38.940
made this impossible.

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.440
It also clarifies to what extent

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.440
this is a specifically
Ukrainian event, by the way.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.880
The fact that Ukrainians knew

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.670
that if they went north
to Belarus or to Russia,

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:50.220
they'd be more likely to be fed.

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:51.570
And it has the same kind of irony

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:53.040
as begging in the cities does, by the way,

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.920
because Ukraine produces food for Belarus,

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.630
it produces food for Russia.

00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:59.613
But Ukrainians in this situation,

00:42:00.663 --> 00:42:01.800
were going to Ukraine,

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.110
were going to Belarus and to Russia.

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:07.113
So by the summer of 1933,

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.010
and again, we don't have time,

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:12.180
you know, and maybe there are words,

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.700
it'd be very difficult to
describe what this means.

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.200
But by the summer of 1933,

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.880
we're at about 3 million
inhabitants of Soviet Ukraine dead.

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:25.230
In addition to this, the
Ukrainian party itself,

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:26.910
the Ukrainian party has been purged.

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:30.513
About 120,000 people are forced
out of the Ukrainian party.

00:42:32.648 --> 00:42:34.980
and particular focus is on the people

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:37.980
who had carried out the
Ukrainization policies of the 1920s.

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:43.500
Mykola Khvylovy commits suicide

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:47.880
on the 13th of May 1933
after learning of the arrest,

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.433
he was this very important writer,

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.340
the one who led the Literary Discussion.

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.980
After he learned of the
arrest of one of his friends,

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.233
another writer, he committed suicide.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.290
He would certainly have
been killed otherwise,

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:02.943
he was not wrong to believe that.

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.610
The Ukrainian writers were taken

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:09.480
to a specific concentration
camp in Karelia,

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.303
where a number of them
were later executed.

00:43:13.536 --> 00:43:14.370
There's a term for this,

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:16.527
which is the "Executed Renaissance,"

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.900
captures the phenomenon very nicely

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.310
'cause there was a renaissance.

00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:22.650
The 1920s really were a renaissance.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:26.160
It was the most interesting
decade in Ukrainian culture,

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.870
at least until 1914,

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:29.070
at least until 2014,

00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:30.750
to the present, which is
also very interesting.

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:33.330
But the 1920s were
extraordinarily productive

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:34.950
in basically all fields of culture.

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:36.600
And then almost everybody who was,

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:37.433
not almost everybody,

00:43:37.433 --> 00:43:39.813
most of the people involved were executed.

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:44.190
Okay, and then a few weeks
later, Mykola Skrypnyk,

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:47.010
the guy who had been the
commissar for education

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:49.360
is himself accused the national deviation

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.380
and also commits suicide.

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:53.550
So those two suicides

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:57.780
are symbolic of, you know,
the end of the 1920s,

00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:59.880
the end of this idea that
Ukraine could somehow

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.213
move forward into a communist future.

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:05.670
The postscript to this,

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:07.740
as I wanted to suggest
at the very beginning,

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.573
is the Great Terror.

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:13.440
So the Great Terror is a
separate chapter in "Bloodlands,"

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.670
and you'll read about it.

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:19.670
But there are a couple of
odd ways in which the Terror,

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:23.850
the mass shootings and
deportations of 1937, 1938,

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:28.410
are actually kind of an
afterword to the famine.

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:31.260
Or they're another example
of this principle that,

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.020
especially in conditions
of extreme tyranny,

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:36.720
you will find yourself doubling down

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.820
on the terrible policies that you made

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.470
rather than altering them,

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:41.310
rather than, you know,

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:43.800
rather than taking some
kind of responsibility.

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.420
I mean, you could say, I mean,

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:47.190
from an ethical point of view,

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:48.750
one of the most interesting things about

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:50.400
this kind of ideology is that

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.730
it allows you never to have
to take responsibility, right?

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:56.400
The word responsibility never appears

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.020
or to put in the converse way,

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:02.160
when people in the sixties
and seventies begin to,

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.760
in the communist world,
say interesting things

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.077
in opposition to communism,

00:45:07.077 --> 00:45:11.220
the the moral vocabulary
which they draw from

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:13.440
is centered around the
word responsibility.

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.390
Which I mean, if you just
sort of flip that around,

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:18.360
you can see one of the attractions

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.010
of being on the inside of this, right?

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:21.900
That you don't have to
take responsibility.

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:22.733
Okay.

00:45:22.733 --> 00:45:24.690
So the Terror.

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:27.810
In two ways, the Terror is
connected to the famine.

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:31.660
The first is that the five-year plan

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:36.510
includes in February 1930,

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:39.360
the idea of "de-kulakization."

00:45:40.976 --> 00:45:44.370
So a "Kulak" is a more prosperous peasant,

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:47.910
or somebody whose neighbor
says he's more prosperous,

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:51.150
and de-kulakization means
a kind of artificial

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:53.370
class conflict in the countryside

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:56.880
where the middle peasants
and the poorer peasants

00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:00.270
are supposed to denounce
the better off peasants,

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:01.890
and then the better off peasants are sent

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:04.740
to this emerging system
of concentration camps

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.180
in the Soviet periphery,

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:07.950
which we know is the gulag.

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:12.480
So as a result of de-kulakization
beginning the 1930,

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.730
a lot of peasants,

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:16.770
the disproportionate Ukrainian peasants

00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:21.030
were sent thousands of
kilometers away to Siberia,

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:24.303
to camps, for five-year terms.

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:26.273
Where,

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:31.440
Stalin gets the idea,

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:33.240
they were vulnerable to being recruited

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.073
by Japanese military intelligence.

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:41.040
Not quite as crazy as it seems,

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:42.270
Japanese military intelligence

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:44.430
was actually quite active and skillful,

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.650
and they were thinking
about the national question

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:48.210
inside the Soviet Union.

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:50.460
So it's not pulled from nowhere, right?

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:51.990
I mean, the thing about all of these ideas

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:53.640
behind the Terror is that they're not,

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.800
they're never pulled from nowhere,

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.110
they just take some element of reality

00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:00.630
and exaggerate it to
grotesque proportions.

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:03.000
But so the idea was these peasants

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.440
are serving five year terms,

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.990
they're gonna be coming back
to the Western Soviet Union,

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.730
and they may cause trouble, right?

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:09.960
1931,

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.363
so 1935, 36, 37.

00:47:14.041 --> 00:47:17.310
This is one of the origins
of the peasant action,

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:19.800
which is the major action
in the Great Terror.

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.820
So when you think of the Great Terror,

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:21.653
if you think about it at all,

00:47:21.653 --> 00:47:23.490
you might be thinking
of the intellectuals,

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:25.650
and the show trials of the party members.

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:27.840
That was about 60,000.

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:30.180
The Great Terror was about 700,000 people.

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:32.040
The biggest group affected
by the Great Terror

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.330
were actually the peasants,

00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:36.060
and the suspicion of the peasants

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:38.640
goes back to collectivization.

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.387
Or, you know, if you
like, the notion that,

00:47:40.387 --> 00:47:43.260
"We did something drastic
and terrible to them,

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.760
maybe it wouldn't be so surprising

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.760
if at some point they might
wanna do something to us."

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.860
That's the fundamental logic.

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:53.580
The second set of major
actions in the Terror

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.560
are the national actions.

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.720
Again, the details are
all in "Bloodlands."

00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:59.760
And the most important
of the national actions,

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.930
the bloodiest one,

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:03.000
which more than 100,000
people are executed,

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.920
which is a big number.

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:06.720
Is the Polish action.

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:10.350
And the roots of the Polish
action go back to the famine.

00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:14.430
Because the explanation that
was given for the famine was,

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:15.630
there's the Polish state,

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:17.010
there are Polish espionage,

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:19.050
the Poles have recruited
the Ukrainian communists,

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:21.720
that's why they're carrying
out all this sabotage.

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:25.800
That is not true in anything
like social reality,

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.010
but it remains true inside
the Soviet apparatus

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:30.840
of repression.

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:34.110
That story, if I can torture you,

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:35.520
that's not how I want to put it,

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:38.310
if people are tortured
on a very large scale,

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:40.770
according to a scheme in which the idea

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:42.750
is to get them to repeat a certain story,

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:45.210
like, "When were you recruited
by Poland?" And so on.

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:47.160
then those documents become part

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:48.750
of the internal bureaucratic reality

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:50.300
of the apparatus of repression.

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:53.160
And then the Polish, or the Polish plot,

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.080
although it didn't
really exist in reality,

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:59.040
only gets bigger in the
internal bureaucratic reality

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.620
of the apparatus of repression.

00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:04.317
To the point that this fellow Balyts'kyi,

00:49:04.317 --> 00:49:05.820
who I mentioned earlier,

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:08.820
the guy who made it up in
the first place, right?

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:11.640
The creative intelligence
chief who made it up,

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:15.817
he was then caught himself
according to this logic.

00:49:15.817 --> 00:49:18.660
"If the Polish penetration of
Ukraine and the Soviet Union

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:21.273
was so incredibly
important, comrade Balyts'kyi,

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:24.363
why weren't you onto it earlier?

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.850
Perhaps that's because you yourself

00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:28.770
are a Polish spy, right?"

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:30.540
So the person who invented this idea

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:33.690
was himself executed as a Polish spy.

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:34.523
But that's just a,

00:49:34.523 --> 00:49:36.780
that's an individual example
of a much larger phenomenon,

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:39.690
which is that in the national actions,

00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:41.490
roughly 100,000 people will be killed

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:44.550
as being a spy, as spies for Poland.

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:48.300
And this, although it's a
horrifying event in its own right,

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:51.180
in some sense also goes
back to this original

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:52.350
set of collectivization.

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:54.300
But it's the suspicion of Poland,

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:57.000
the story of Poland, and the inability

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.460
of the regime to admit mistakes,

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:00.810
take responsibility,

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:03.240
and the way that a big
lie then metastasizes

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:05.640
and remains inside a system,

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:08.040
all of that lead us towards these events

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.000
in the Great Terror.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.383
Okay, Thank you very much.

00:50:14.878 --> 00:50:17.295
(calm music)

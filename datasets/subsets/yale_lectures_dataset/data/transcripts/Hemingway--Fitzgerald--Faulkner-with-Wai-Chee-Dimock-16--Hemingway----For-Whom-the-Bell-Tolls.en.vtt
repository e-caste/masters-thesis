00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:05.333
WAI CHEE DIMOCK: We're
starting today on Hemingway's

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.000
For Whom the Bell Tolls.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.933
And as is frequently the case,
the title comes from a very

00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:17.200
well known classic, in this case
John Donne's poem, which

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.200
is actually included
in the text of For

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.367
Whom the Bell Tolls.

00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:24.433
So you guys can just go and
read it for on your own.

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:28.767
But I just thought that we'll
talk about it together, a very

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:31.967
famous phrase from a
very famous poem--

00:00:31.967 --> 00:00:35.400
"No man is an island,
entire of itself.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.233
Each is a piece of the
continent, a part of the main.

00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:46.567
If a clod be washed away by the
sea, Europe is the less.

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:50.733
Each man's death diminishes
me, for I

00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.833
am involved in mankind.

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:57.700
Therefore, send not for whom the
bell tolls, it tolls for

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.633
thee."

00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:02.700
So a number of issues come
up in this poem--

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.600
justly famous poem--

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.100
that even though we
have separate

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.633
bodies, Donne's argument--

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:14.133
and in fact throughout his
entire poetic corpus--

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:19.167
is that our separate bodies
sometimes become optical

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:22.800
illusion and also experiential
illusion as well.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.633
We feel that we're just one
unit, but we are actually tied

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:29.467
in so many different ways
to other people.

00:01:29.467 --> 00:01:34.400
So the death of other people
would diminish me in the sense

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.500
that those ties will be cut
when those people die.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.400
But also there's a more
disturbing sense that the

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.067
manner of death of other people
is in some sense also a

00:01:50.067 --> 00:01:54.733
kind of a prelude, and an
analogy, and a suggestion of

00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:57.033
the way that we would die.

00:01:57.033 --> 00:02:01.033
So the bell is tolling for
someone else right now, but

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:04.433
sooner or later it's
going to toll for

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:08.300
myself, for you and me.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.567
Death is central.

00:02:09.567 --> 00:02:13.167
It's absolutely central to
For Whom the Bell Tolls.

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:16.500
It's not just a general argument
about the importance

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.867
of interconnections.

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:20.733
It's really about our
interconnections and death.

00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:26.333
No other work by Hemingway is so
centrally meditating on the

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:29.400
phenomenon of dying and what
it is to die a good death.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.700
So we'll come back to this.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.333
But today that wouldn't
be the focus.

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:39.300
And instead today we'll be
talking mostly about the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.667
Spanish Civil War, which is a
very important context for

00:02:42.667 --> 00:02:43.767
this novel.

00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:46.167
And it's very important
to get some historical

00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:47.667
facts under our belt.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:51.067
So basically, the two sides of
The Spanish Civil War are the

00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:53.700
Republicans and the
Nationalists.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.133
The Republicans are sometimes
referred to as the Loyalists.

00:02:57.133 --> 00:03:00.633
And this phrase is sometimes
misleading, because it

00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:03.167
suggests that maybe the
Loyalists are on the right.

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:04.667
But this is actually
not the case.

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:11.633
The Republicans are on the left,
but they're loyal to the

00:03:11.633 --> 00:03:14.600
legitimately elected
government.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.767
The Spanish Republic had
an elected government.

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:22.933
And so the Loyalists
were loyal to that.

00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:25.467
They were protecting the
Spanish Republic.

00:03:25.467 --> 00:03:28.500
And the reason we know that they
are on the left is that

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.567
they're backed by Mexico, which
is understandable given

00:03:31.567 --> 00:03:33.267
the Spanish connection.

00:03:33.267 --> 00:03:36.667
But they were also backed by the
Soviet Union So there are

00:03:36.667 --> 00:03:40.500
lots of references to Russians
in this novel, from Russian

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.933
planes, to Russian cigarettes,
to Russians

00:03:43.933 --> 00:03:45.467
at the Hotel Gaylord--

00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:49.300
so lots and lots of Russians,
a Russian general in the

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.200
opening pages of the novel.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.033
So the Soviet Union was a
central presence in his novel.

00:03:58.033 --> 00:04:02.133
But more than that, the reason
that the Spanish Civil War has

00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:05.633
gone down in history as such
an important war is that it

00:04:05.633 --> 00:04:10.633
was supported by 30,000
international volunteers

00:04:10.633 --> 00:04:14.300
making up the international
brigades, including people

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.900
from Poland, France, England,
and lots of volunteers from

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:20.733
the United States.

00:04:20.733 --> 00:04:24.100
So the United States volunteers
were called the

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.333
Abraham Lincoln Brigade.

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:30.033
And then so all this is on the
Republican side, on the side

00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:32.033
of the Spanish Republic.

00:04:32.033 --> 00:04:36.367
And then opposing that, fighting
that, and eventually

00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:39.733
triumphant in prevailing
over them would be the

00:04:39.733 --> 00:04:41.233
Nationalists.

00:04:41.233 --> 00:04:45.700
In this novel, Hemingway does
not refer to the Nationalists

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.433
as the Nationalists.

00:04:46.433 --> 00:04:48.667
The word never comes up.

00:04:48.667 --> 00:04:51.633
He refers to them as Fascists.

00:04:51.633 --> 00:04:55.667
And the word has such a
pejorative ring now that it

00:04:55.667 --> 00:04:58.300
seems as if he's condemning
them ahead of time.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.200
But actually, in the
1930s fascist was

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.133
just a neutral word.

00:05:03.133 --> 00:05:05.400
That was the party,
the Fascist Party.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.533
So even though now historians
would refer to that side as

00:05:09.533 --> 00:05:13.433
the Nationalist side, in my
lectures I'll be referring to

00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:15.367
them as Fascists, just because
that's the word

00:05:15.367 --> 00:05:17.733
that Hemingway uses.

00:05:17.733 --> 00:05:22.700
And the Fascists were backed
by Germany and Italy.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.100
So we see lots of German
planes as well,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.700
Italian planes as well.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.900
And the victory of the
Fascists led to the

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.233
dictatorship of General Franco,
who would go on to

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:36.767
rule Spain for many years.

00:05:36.767 --> 00:05:39.133
So we know the outcome
of that war.

00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:41.633
And it's a very tragic outcome
according to many people.

00:05:44.133 --> 00:05:50.033
One of the great photographers
of the war was Robert Capa.

00:05:50.033 --> 00:05:53.967
And fortunately, many of his
images are now available in

00:05:53.967 --> 00:05:55.367
the public domain.

00:05:55.367 --> 00:05:57.867
So this is Robert Capa
photographing the

00:05:57.867 --> 00:05:59.300
Spanish Civil War.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.000
And this is the most
iconic image.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.967
It's 1936 the death of a
Loyalist Republican soldier.

00:06:07.967 --> 00:06:13.133
And most of Capa's pictures tend
to be about the death of

00:06:13.133 --> 00:06:18.467
just one person, a kind of a
visceral reaction to the death

00:06:18.467 --> 00:06:20.300
that person.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.567
And kind of blurry as well,
because that's probably how

00:06:24.567 --> 00:06:26.667
death will feel when
it comes to us.

00:06:26.667 --> 00:06:30.467
It's that we don't have a very
distinct sensation of that

00:06:30.467 --> 00:06:32.700
condition when we're
going through it.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.833
At least I think that's the
rationale behind it, other

00:06:36.833 --> 00:06:39.167
than the fact that he was just
on site taking the picture

00:06:39.167 --> 00:06:41.133
right there.

00:06:41.133 --> 00:06:45.967
Here is another picture by
Robert Capa, again 1936, at

00:06:45.967 --> 00:06:49.367
the very beginning of the war.

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.567
And these people were just
college students.

00:06:51.567 --> 00:06:53.867
This was University
City in Madrid.

00:06:53.867 --> 00:06:57.300
Most of the people who
fought in the Spanish

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.933
Civil War were civilians.

00:07:00.933 --> 00:07:05.167
They were just students,
lots of women actually.

00:07:05.167 --> 00:07:09.767
This was a war known for the
presence of women fighting.

00:07:09.767 --> 00:07:15.433
So in many ways, because these
were just volunteers, it

00:07:15.433 --> 00:07:18.367
wasn't a very high tech war.

00:07:18.367 --> 00:07:21.900
And Robert Capa had a lot
of footage about this

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.400
very low tech war.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.600
And basically this is the war
that we see in For Whom the

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.167
Bell Tolls.

00:07:28.167 --> 00:07:31.233
Just one or two people walking
through the mountains just

00:07:31.233 --> 00:07:35.600
trudging along talking to
small groups of people,

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.967
completely kind of local
initiative, and not just in

00:07:39.967 --> 00:07:43.767
the cities but also in
the countryside.

00:07:43.767 --> 00:07:46.267
And we should remember that in
For Whom the Bell Tolls it's

00:07:46.267 --> 00:07:47.833
actually behind the lines.

00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:52.200
They are behind the
enemy lines.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.567
One possibility would be to go
back to the Spanish Republic,

00:07:55.567 --> 00:07:58.533
to cross the enemy lines
and go back and join

00:07:58.533 --> 00:07:59.767
with the main forces.

00:07:59.767 --> 00:08:03.000
But the people that we see in
For Whom the Bell Tolls were

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.367
the guerrillas, who would be in
conditions such as these.

00:08:07.367 --> 00:08:11.900
So this is the kind of the
iconic images of just

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.467
civilians fighting to defend
the Spanish Republic.

00:08:15.467 --> 00:08:22.033
But the reason that it was such
a big global event was

00:08:22.033 --> 00:08:25.967
that it was actually an
incredibly high-tech war.

00:08:25.967 --> 00:08:29.767
So it was a very important link
between the First World

00:08:29.767 --> 00:08:31.767
War and the Second World War.

00:08:31.767 --> 00:08:36.200
And we know that the alliances
in the Spanish Civil War,

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.067
Germany and Italy, would go on
to become the Axis Powers in

00:08:39.067 --> 00:08:40.100
the Second World War--

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.267
so a very, very important
link between those

00:08:43.267 --> 00:08:44.600
two great world wars.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.100
Itself the Spanish Civil War
was a world war of sorts,

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.633
given the number of
international participants.

00:08:51.633 --> 00:08:53.533
So tanks are very important.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:58.267
And the Republicans actually
used tractors, but the

00:08:58.267 --> 00:09:00.400
Fascists had real tanks.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.667
And we see them, the tanks,
in full force.

00:09:05.667 --> 00:09:09.200
And this is the final image of
the triumph of the tanks.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.800
The fascists entering
Madrid March, 1939.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.700
And the next month the
republic, the Spanish

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.933
Republic, surrendered
to the Fascists.

00:09:19.933 --> 00:09:21.000
So we know the outcome
very well.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.200
It was basically a
very short war.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.467
But because they were
defending an elected

00:09:28.467 --> 00:09:32.700
government, the international
sentiment was on the side of

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.067
the Spanish Republic.

00:09:34.067 --> 00:09:39.133
And this is a very famous
painting by the Spanish

00:09:39.133 --> 00:09:41.200
painter Joan Miro.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.167
But you'll notice that the
language is actually not

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:48.733
Spanish, "Aidez Espagne." That's
French, because he

00:09:48.733 --> 00:09:53.400
couldn't stay in Spain anymore
after the outbreak of the war.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.367
So he had to flee to France,
and this was actually in

00:09:57.367 --> 00:09:58.900
exhibition in Paris.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.767
So that's why the language
was in French.

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:05.433
And French will actually come
up a little bit in For Whom

00:10:05.433 --> 00:10:08.767
the Bell Tolls as well
-- or as France.

00:10:08.767 --> 00:10:11.233
So it's kind of an interesting
side reference that we'll be

00:10:11.233 --> 00:10:13.633
talking about next time.

00:10:13.633 --> 00:10:18.033
But lots and lots of images
of international aid--

00:10:18.033 --> 00:10:21.433
once again, mostly very
nonmilitary looking people

00:10:21.433 --> 00:10:24.667
were giving aid to do the
Spanish Republic.

00:10:24.667 --> 00:10:27.633
So these were artists
in London just

00:10:27.633 --> 00:10:30.367
giving medical supplies.

00:10:30.367 --> 00:10:35.467
But the Americans were there in
full force, and this is the

00:10:35.467 --> 00:10:37.867
Abraham Lincoln Brigade.

00:10:37.867 --> 00:10:44.167
They're actually the best
equipped volunteers.

00:10:44.167 --> 00:10:47.100
There were pictures of
volunteers from Poland.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:52.067
And they actually looked kind
of sad, to begin with, even

00:10:52.067 --> 00:10:53.300
without the fighting.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.933
But the Americans were very well
equipped, and they looked

00:10:55.933 --> 00:10:58.733
very healthy and
ready to fight.

00:10:58.733 --> 00:11:00.467
And they were also
very, very young.

00:11:00.467 --> 00:11:03.233
So it was a very glamorous war,
in one sense, because of

00:11:03.233 --> 00:11:06.600
all young people who
were fighting.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.833
And women there, as we can see,
and in the beginning of

00:11:11.833 --> 00:11:13.867
the war there was lots of
musical entertainment.

00:11:13.867 --> 00:11:16.933
And it seemed like
fun, initially.

00:11:16.933 --> 00:11:22.900
It quickly stopping being fun,
as we can tell from the novel.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.400
So Hemingway was there.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.667
He was a war correspondent.

00:11:25.667 --> 00:11:30.600
He was covering the war with the
Republicans here and this

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.867
rare image of him actually
holding a gun.

00:11:34.867 --> 00:11:36.433
He wasn't supposed
to fight them.

00:11:36.433 --> 00:11:39.000
I don't think he actually
fought, but just in case he

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.067
needed to do something.

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:47.067
So it oddly suggests that one
way to think about the novel

00:11:47.067 --> 00:11:50.967
would be to think about a kind
of divide in the novel --

00:11:50.967 --> 00:11:53.300
a kind of structural
principle --

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.733
in terms of voluntary
association versus involuntary

00:11:57.733 --> 00:12:00.333
association.

00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:02.867
Voluntary association, obviously
the International

00:12:02.867 --> 00:12:08.100
Brigades, all these people did
not have to fight in the war.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:13.933
They all voluntarily put
themselves in danger for

00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:17.800
political reasons, so very much
voluntary association.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:23.700
And there's lots of glory, and
honor, and pleasure from that,

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.633
pride from that.

00:12:25.633 --> 00:12:29.067
And then on the opposite side
would be involuntary

00:12:29.067 --> 00:12:30.633
association.

00:12:30.633 --> 00:12:33.467
Now we get labeled
as foreigners.

00:12:33.467 --> 00:12:36.533
The Americans get labeled
as foreigners.

00:12:36.533 --> 00:12:39.967
Robert Jordan gets labeled
as a foreigner.

00:12:39.967 --> 00:12:43.033
He's not even given the dignity
of being an American.

00:12:43.033 --> 00:12:46.600
He's referred to as the Ingles,
the English, so they

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.333
even get his national
identity wrong.

00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:51.200
But it doesn't really matter.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.000
He's just one of those
foreigners.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.933
So foreigner is a kind of
involuntary association, a

00:12:55.933 --> 00:12:57.867
generic type.

00:12:57.867 --> 00:13:00.800
And then the ultimate
involuntary association would

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.500
be the company of the dead.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:08.367
It's a very large company, and
very few of us are ready to

00:13:08.367 --> 00:13:12.100
join them, right now, but we
are put in that company.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:16.400
So going back to Donne,
obviously --

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.833
but also going back to pretty
much all the text that we've

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:23.300
been talking about
all semester.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:27.733
So we've been talking about this
phenomenon of involuntary

00:13:27.733 --> 00:13:31.067
association, in terms of
individual and type.

00:13:31.067 --> 00:13:33.633
So I just want to go back, very
quickly, to refresh your

00:13:33.633 --> 00:13:36.033
memory about all this text.

00:13:36.033 --> 00:13:40.433
In To Have and Have Not,
Harry's involuntary

00:13:40.433 --> 00:13:44.000
association would be with all
the other "have nots." And

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.433
there were plenty of them during
the Great Depression.

00:13:47.433 --> 00:13:50.967
That would be an involuntary
association for him.

00:13:50.967 --> 00:13:57.400
But luckily for him, he actually
can qualify that

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.633
involuntary association when
he's mediated by the presence

00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:07.000
of Marie, when he becomes this
very wonderful and long

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.167
lasting, not perishing,
figure in her mind.

00:14:11.167 --> 00:14:16.200
And when he's mediated in
contrast to Richard Gordon.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.900
In the Fitzgerald stories "Rich
Boy" and "Bernice Bobs

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:23.400
Her Hair," we have the
involuntary association

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.600
through type.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.267
So rich boy Anson Hunter,
he has as an involuntary

00:14:29.267 --> 00:14:32.200
association with the title of
the story "Rich Boy." But he

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.700
deviates so much.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.067
I mean, he's such an extreme
example that

00:14:36.067 --> 00:14:37.533
he's almost a deviation.

00:14:37.533 --> 00:14:41.733
And Bernice reverts to
a much more ancient

00:14:41.733 --> 00:14:44.467
type, the Native American.

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:47.733
So they all have a kind of
qualified involuntary

00:14:47.733 --> 00:14:50.900
association to the immediate
surroundings.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.067
And As I Lay Dying, which we
just finished discussing, is

00:14:54.067 --> 00:14:57.333
Faulkner's version of To
Have and Have Not.

00:14:57.333 --> 00:15:02.667
And actually there it seems that
the concept of "have not"

00:15:02.667 --> 00:15:11.467
is most tenacious and in many
ways victorious at the end,

00:15:11.467 --> 00:15:13.267
triumphant at the end.

00:15:13.267 --> 00:15:18.433
In the sense that Darl really
is involuntarily confined to

00:15:18.433 --> 00:15:25.733
Jackson, he has an involuntary
sojurn in a mental

00:15:25.733 --> 00:15:27.300
institution.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.333
So that is--

00:15:29.333 --> 00:15:33.733
in many ways Faulkner is the
most pessimistic of those

00:15:33.733 --> 00:15:35.633
three writers.

00:15:35.633 --> 00:15:40.833
Today we'll look at the
complicated sevenfold

00:15:40.833 --> 00:15:44.900
permutations in For Whom
the Bell Tolls.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.067
And we won't be talking about
all of them today.

00:15:47.067 --> 00:15:52.333
So this pretty much is the
pattern or the structure for

00:15:52.333 --> 00:15:55.633
the next four lectures.

00:15:55.633 --> 00:15:58.700
But I just want to give you a
sense of what we're talking

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:03.567
about, individuals versus type
obviously, voluntary versus

00:16:03.567 --> 00:16:06.333
involuntary, and given the
fact that the setting is

00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:10.500
Spain, foreign versus
not foreign.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:14.233
And the question of language
brings up the question of

00:16:14.233 --> 00:16:17.233
literacy and illiteracy.

00:16:17.233 --> 00:16:22.600
And the relation between the
distant home and the on-site

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.667
environment is going to be very
important, because the

00:16:25.667 --> 00:16:28.700
United States actually has quite
an important presence in

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.233
this novel.

00:16:29.233 --> 00:16:32.633
So that's the relation between
the United States and Spain.

00:16:32.633 --> 00:16:34.900
And something that we've been
talking about all the way

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.700
through, comic versus tragic,
and finally, to

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.700
have and have not.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.900
So all of this we'll
be talking about in

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.733
the next two weeks.

00:16:44.733 --> 00:16:49.167
But today we'll concentrate on
the concept of involuntary

00:16:49.167 --> 00:16:51.067
foreigners.

00:16:51.067 --> 00:16:55.000
And it turns out that there are
actually two classes of

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.433
involuntary foreigners, one
completely counterintuitive.

00:16:59.433 --> 00:17:02.467
We would think that the
involuntary foreigners would

00:17:02.467 --> 00:17:03.600
just be Americans.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.800
They are the obvious
foreigners.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:10.067
And Hemingway gives us multiple
instances of when one

00:17:10.067 --> 00:17:13.067
could be an involuntary
foreigner.

00:17:13.067 --> 00:17:19.333
But I think that he is an astute
enough reader of the

00:17:19.333 --> 00:17:23.767
future and of the global
dimension of the Spanish Civil

00:17:23.767 --> 00:17:29.900
War to know that the Spanish
could also be involuntary

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.967
foreigners in their
own country.

00:17:32.967 --> 00:17:35.533
This is happening all
the time now.

00:17:35.533 --> 00:17:38.267
Lots and lots of people are
involuntary foreigners in

00:17:38.267 --> 00:17:38.933
their country.

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:42.100
It is one of the most common
phenomena of the

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.067
twenty-first century.

00:17:44.067 --> 00:17:49.733
And Hemingway is portraying some
of that already during

00:17:49.733 --> 00:17:53.467
the Spanish Civil War, because
of the phenomena of print

00:17:53.467 --> 00:17:57.367
illiteracy and because of
technological illiteracy that,

00:17:57.367 --> 00:17:59.700
again, is a very, very common.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.200
So let's just start on
the American side.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:10.133
We know that Hemingway is
actually very, very good in

00:18:10.133 --> 00:18:14.267
being considerate of those of
us who don't know Spanish or

00:18:14.267 --> 00:18:18.133
who just know a few
words in Spanish.

00:18:18.133 --> 00:18:22.133
When he uses a Spanish word
phrase, he would give us the

00:18:22.133 --> 00:18:23.700
translation almost right away.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.967
So we have no trouble
understanding the

00:18:26.967 --> 00:18:29.367
Spanish in the novel.

00:18:29.367 --> 00:18:33.933
But he does have this
interesting stylistic

00:18:33.933 --> 00:18:39.167
innovation of inflecting the
English language in the

00:18:39.167 --> 00:18:40.833
direction of Spanish.

00:18:40.833 --> 00:18:47.300
So the classic example is the
unidiomatic expression, "How

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.200
are you called?" It is
what's your name.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.100
We don't go around asking
people, how are you called,

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:58.967
because Spanish is not really
the reference point for most

00:18:58.967 --> 00:19:02.600
of us at any rate, in this
country, not yet.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:09.600
But in Spain that's the form
English would take, even in

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.900
your own head.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:16.467
What you would ask people all
the time is, "Como se llama

00:19:16.467 --> 00:19:19.867
Usted?" "How are you
called," literally

00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:22.300
translated from that.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.867
And it's a more formal
expression.

00:19:26.867 --> 00:19:29.800
"Tu" is not to someone
that you know well.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.033
It's a more formal expression,
addressing someone that maybe

00:19:34.033 --> 00:19:38.100
you're meeting for the first
time, someone who's older,

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.433
showing more respect
for the person or

00:19:40.433 --> 00:19:43.467
distance from the person.

00:19:43.467 --> 00:19:50.300
What is the effect of this
kind of English, not

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.567
translated into Spanish
words but translated

00:19:54.567 --> 00:19:58.000
into Spanish syntax?

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.000
It is not the actual translation
into Spanish words

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
but translation using
the syntactical

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.400
structure of Spanish.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.833
I think that there are many
effects, depending on your

00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:15.167
degree of knowledge of
Spanish, really.

00:20:15.167 --> 00:20:16.433
It could be irritating--

00:20:16.433 --> 00:20:21.500
I imagine actually-- for
a Spanish speaker.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.500
But I think that for people
who actually have a very

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.200
slight acquaintance with Spanish
the effect is the kind

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.667
of a double alienation.

00:20:30.667 --> 00:20:33.833
We should take note of
the fact that this

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:36.867
is unidiomatic English.

00:20:36.867 --> 00:20:41.033
And we're struggling to think of
the Spanish equivalent for

00:20:41.033 --> 00:20:45.300
that that would be the origin
for the English phrase.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:53.167
In any case, it makes us aware
of how English actually is not

00:20:53.167 --> 00:20:58.467
translatable word for word
into the Spanish.

00:20:58.467 --> 00:21:01.467
What's your name cannot
be translated word

00:21:01.467 --> 00:21:02.967
for word into Spanish.

00:21:02.967 --> 00:21:04.100
So it highlights the

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.800
non-translatability of English.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.067
And the fact that there really
are very important

00:21:10.067 --> 00:21:15.300
cross-cultural barriers, not
least of all in language as a

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.267
the cross-cultural barrier.

00:21:17.267 --> 00:21:20.367
Certain things cannot
get across easily.

00:21:20.367 --> 00:21:24.067
They cannot get across
without modification.

00:21:24.067 --> 00:21:29.333
So Hemingway gives us no
illusion that you can fit

00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:33.533
easily into a different
environment.

00:21:33.533 --> 00:21:36.700
He gives us no illusion that
there could be this immediate

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.833
communion between people from
different cultural and

00:21:39.833 --> 00:21:42.033
linguistic backgrounds.

00:21:42.033 --> 00:21:45.833
I think that the effect of this
double alienation is also

00:21:45.833 --> 00:21:52.067
to make us aware of sometimes
how strange the English

00:21:52.067 --> 00:21:54.633
language would be.

00:21:54.633 --> 00:21:58.067
So every time you know more
than one language, you're

00:21:58.067 --> 00:22:03.300
aware of how each of those
languages is actually quite

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.800
strange in peculiar instances.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:14.167
So it makes everyone a sort
of involuntary foreigner.

00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:17.500
Even though you're still
at home, really.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.667
You're still a native speaker
of one language.

00:22:20.667 --> 00:22:24.100
The fact that you're aware of
other languages into which

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:28.167
your own native language
cannot be automatically

00:22:28.167 --> 00:22:34.267
translated makes you almost a
foreigner, a slight foreigner

00:22:34.267 --> 00:22:37.500
in your own native language.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:42.367
But this is a very mild and
really not painful form, I

00:22:42.367 --> 00:22:44.833
think, of being a foreigner.

00:22:44.833 --> 00:22:49.867
Things start getting more
painful, very fast actually,

00:22:49.867 --> 00:22:51.633
in For Whom the Bell Tolls.

00:22:51.633 --> 00:22:53.033
But people still
joke about it.

00:22:53.033 --> 00:22:57.133
So here is Robert Jordan
talking to the Russian

00:22:57.133 --> 00:22:59.067
general, Golz.

00:22:59.067 --> 00:23:02.467
I don't actually know it's
pronounced in Russian.

00:23:02.467 --> 00:23:05.100
But they were talking
about the bridge.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.267
And we know that Robert
is supposed

00:23:07.267 --> 00:23:08.600
to blow-up the bridge.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.467
So they were actually
talking business.

00:23:11.467 --> 00:23:15.600
And Robert Jordan is assuring
the Russian general that he

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:22.533
knows exactly what to do, that
he's a very good engineer.

00:23:22.533 --> 00:23:26.000
He is very good with
explosives.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.867
And this is what Golz says,
"'I believe you do.'"--

00:23:28.867 --> 00:23:30.167
do know how to blow-up
the bridge--

00:23:30.167 --> 00:23:32.667
"'I will not make you
any little speech.

00:23:32.667 --> 00:23:34.133
Let us have a drink.

00:23:34.133 --> 00:23:37.000
So much talking makes
me very thirsty.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.533
Commrade Hordan.

00:23:38.533 --> 00:23:43.800
You have a funny name in Spanish
Comrade Hordown.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.833
How do you say Golz in Spanish,
Comrade General?'

00:23:47.833 --> 00:23:52.400
'Holze,' said Golz, grinning,
making the sound deep in his

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.833
throat as though hawking
with a bad cold.

00:23:55.833 --> 00:23:57.567
'Hotze,' he croaked.

00:23:57.567 --> 00:24:00.167
'Comrade Heneral Khorze.

00:24:00.167 --> 00:24:06.567
If I had known how they
pronounce Golz in Spanish I

00:24:06.567 --> 00:24:09.700
would pick me out a better
name before I come to war

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:10.133
here.'"

00:24:10.133 --> 00:24:14.633
So the Spanish "G" and "J"
sounds are pronounced as "H."

00:24:14.633 --> 00:24:19.400
So that's why it's especially
disconcerting when you have

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.133
the combination of those, as
in Comrade General Golz.

00:24:24.733 --> 00:24:24.867
I can't even say it now.

00:24:24.867 --> 00:24:26.133
I'm so confused.

00:24:28.867 --> 00:24:31.033
It is really totally
alienating.

00:24:31.033 --> 00:24:33.900
Your own name becomes
unrecognizable

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.967
in a foreign language.

00:24:36.967 --> 00:24:38.333
Most of the time it
doesn't happen.

00:24:38.333 --> 00:24:42.467
But it just so happens that in
this one instance, there

00:24:42.467 --> 00:24:47.733
really is kind of a double
alienation going on for Golz.

00:24:47.733 --> 00:24:51.133
So what does it mean when your
own name is not pronounceable?

00:24:51.133 --> 00:24:55.667
There's just no equivalent
sound in Spanish.

00:24:55.667 --> 00:25:01.433
It could be a really innocent
and completely innocuous or

00:25:01.433 --> 00:25:03.967
trivial occurrence.

00:25:03.967 --> 00:25:10.500
But for something like that,
one is almost involuntarily

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:14.933
tempted to read more
meaning into that.

00:25:14.933 --> 00:25:17.033
There's just no Spanish

00:25:17.033 --> 00:25:20.100
equivalent for my own identity.

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.867
In that language there's
no room.

00:25:22.867 --> 00:25:24.300
There's no place.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.833
There's just no slot that
is waiting for me

00:25:26.833 --> 00:25:28.533
that I can fit in.

00:25:28.533 --> 00:25:32.933
There's just no sound that will
reproduce a necessary

00:25:32.933 --> 00:25:35.600
sound in English.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.400
So it really raises the question
of what kind of a

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.867
place Robert Jordan could have
in the Spanish community.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.767
If there's no linguistic, if
there's no phonetic slot for

00:25:51.767 --> 00:25:56.900
him in the Spanish language,
would there be a social slot

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.167
for him in that Spanish
community?

00:25:59.167 --> 00:26:01.533
Would there be a
functional slot

00:26:01.533 --> 00:26:03.433
for him in that community?

00:26:03.433 --> 00:26:06.433
He has a very, very well-defined
function.

00:26:06.433 --> 00:26:08.667
He's there to blow
up the bridge.

00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:12.700
And as long as he sticks to that
very limited function.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.233
He's probably OK.

00:26:14.233 --> 00:26:18.567
There's room for someone who
will blow up bridges and

00:26:18.567 --> 00:26:19.900
leave.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.667
But the thing is people can't
actually just confine

00:26:22.667 --> 00:26:25.967
themselves to that very,
very narrow definition.

00:26:25.967 --> 00:26:28.533
It would be unbearable,
actually, to be no more than

00:26:28.533 --> 00:26:30.900
just someone who's there to
blow up the bridge and do

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:31.700
nothing else.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:35.167
You can't just have that very,
very narrow existence.

00:26:35.167 --> 00:26:37.033
So Robert Jordan has
got to have some

00:26:37.033 --> 00:26:38.700
relations to the people.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:43.867
And once he wanders away from
that very straight, very

00:26:43.867 --> 00:26:47.533
narrow definition things
will get problematic.

00:26:47.533 --> 00:26:49.633
And that's why there's
so much tension

00:26:49.633 --> 00:26:53.200
between him and the Spanish.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.133
So one other instance of
involuntary association and

00:26:58.133 --> 00:27:02.267
being an involuntary
foreigner--

00:27:02.267 --> 00:27:05.233
and the word foreigner is
actually used by the Spanish a

00:27:05.233 --> 00:27:09.667
lot, probably to
insult Robert.

00:27:09.667 --> 00:27:13.933
So Pablo is actually the one
who's especially aggressive

00:27:13.933 --> 00:27:16.100
when it comes to that.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.433
"'There was a foreigner with us
who made the explosions. '

00:27:19.433 --> 00:27:20.367
Pablo said.

00:27:20.367 --> 00:27:22.100
'Do you know him?' 'What was he

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.633
called?' 'I do not remember.

00:27:24.633 --> 00:27:28.333
It was a very rare name.' "What
did he look like?' 'He

00:27:28.333 --> 00:27:33.500
was fair, as you are, but not as
tall with large hands and a

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:37.400
broken nose.' 'Kashkin,"
Robert Jordan said.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.367
"That would be Kashkin."
'Yes,' said Pablo.

00:27:41.367 --> 00:27:43.133
'It was a very rare name.

00:27:43.133 --> 00:27:46.467
Something like that.' 'What
became of him?' 'He is dead

00:27:46.467 --> 00:27:48.567
since April.'"

00:27:48.567 --> 00:27:50.533
A number of things--

00:27:50.533 --> 00:27:54.567
we actually don't know if
Pablo remembers the name

00:27:54.567 --> 00:27:56.700
Kashkin or not.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.767
For all we know, he might
actually be able to remember

00:27:59.767 --> 00:28:02.000
name very well.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.433
They don't have foreigners
every day among them and

00:28:05.433 --> 00:28:08.167
Kashkin is not such a hard
name to remember.

00:28:08.167 --> 00:28:10.333
He probably knows the name.

00:28:10.333 --> 00:28:14.533
He's emphatic about not knowing
the name, not being

00:28:14.533 --> 00:28:16.133
able to recall the name.

00:28:16.133 --> 00:28:19.433
Even when offered the name, he
refuses to repeat the name--

00:28:19.433 --> 00:28:20.867
"Something like that"--

00:28:20.867 --> 00:28:23.467
just a generic foreigner.

00:28:23.467 --> 00:28:28.167
So nothing can be more
aggressive indirectly, by way

00:28:28.167 --> 00:28:32.733
of talking dismissively
about Kashkin as

00:28:32.733 --> 00:28:34.467
a forgettable foreigner.

00:28:34.467 --> 00:28:38.533
Because he's just a generic
type, he's just there to make

00:28:38.533 --> 00:28:40.433
the explosions.

00:28:40.433 --> 00:28:45.633
So in all these ways, he's
making this forgettable,

00:28:45.633 --> 00:28:51.233
unimportant, probably not
liked foreigner the

00:28:51.233 --> 00:28:53.933
predecessor for Robert Jordan.

00:28:53.933 --> 00:28:57.933
And there's a kind of an
unforeseen consequence of

00:28:57.933 --> 00:29:01.300
making Kashkin the predecessor
for Robert.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.633
And Pablo probably doesn't
know that, but Kashkin

00:29:03.633 --> 00:29:06.067
actually had died.

00:29:06.067 --> 00:29:08.933
And we know later on that he
had died he had died by

00:29:08.933 --> 00:29:11.167
killing himself.

00:29:11.167 --> 00:29:17.133
His job is to blow up bridges
or blow up trains.

00:29:17.133 --> 00:29:20.933
But he's just terrified of doing
it, and so he killed

00:29:20.933 --> 00:29:24.900
himself, which Robert
only knows.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:31.367
So a combination of deliberate
aggression from Pablo, in

00:29:31.367 --> 00:29:35.433
turning the foreigner into a
generic type into which both

00:29:35.433 --> 00:29:38.933
Kashkin and Robert would
be inserted.

00:29:38.933 --> 00:29:44.700
That deliberate aggression from
Pablo combined with a

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:48.967
circumstance that he probably
wouldn't have known--

00:29:48.967 --> 00:29:51.600
that Kashkin is dead
at this point--

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.033
all of this made the dead
foreigner, not just a

00:29:55.033 --> 00:29:59.600
foreigner but a dead foreigner,
the sort of

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.000
scripted future for
Robert Jordan.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.133
It's not just that
foreigners cannot

00:30:06.133 --> 00:30:08.333
assimilate into the community.

00:30:08.333 --> 00:30:12.400
But they also have a tendency
to die very soon.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.333
That seems to be the forecast
for Robert Jordan.

00:30:15.333 --> 00:30:20.667
And so we don't know if
this forecast will

00:30:20.667 --> 00:30:23.433
actually become reality.

00:30:23.433 --> 00:30:26.300
It's just a possibility
at this point.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:31.233
But it's a very, very emphatic
possibility that is

00:30:31.233 --> 00:30:34.000
underscored numerous times
actually by other people,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.933
every time Kashkin comes up, how
he died and the fact that

00:30:38.933 --> 00:30:41.700
he's like Robert
in many ways --

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.367
fair haired foreigner --

00:30:44.367 --> 00:30:46.433
all those things come up.

00:30:46.433 --> 00:30:49.000
So it's the kind
of a signature.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.333
It's kind of a structural
signature, narrative signature

00:30:53.333 --> 00:30:58.933
in terms of the punctuation that
Hemingway puts into his

00:30:58.933 --> 00:31:03.100
novel, all those places when
we stop and wonder is a

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:08.467
similar fate awaiting Robert
Jordan, similar to Kashkin.

00:31:08.467 --> 00:31:10.033
So the company of the dead--

00:31:10.033 --> 00:31:12.133
I think it's fair to say--

00:31:12.133 --> 00:31:13.367
is never very far.

00:31:13.367 --> 00:31:15.000
It's always on the horizon.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.400
In fact, it's not even
on the horizon.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.700
It's a looming presence
in that community.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.467
And it's a looming presence,
especially for foreigners in

00:31:22.467 --> 00:31:24.633
that community.

00:31:24.633 --> 00:31:29.500
So that's pretty bad
for Americans.

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.700
We don't actually see
a lot of Americans.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.633
We just see one,
Robert Jordan.

00:31:34.633 --> 00:31:37.767
So it's pretty bad.

00:31:37.767 --> 00:31:40.133
The signs and omens
are not good.

00:31:40.133 --> 00:31:45.300
But it seems that the signs and
omens are also not great

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.233
for the Spanish, as well.

00:31:48.233 --> 00:31:54.400
And we can look at the ways in
which they are involuntary

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.333
foreigners in their
own countries.

00:31:56.333 --> 00:31:59.967
And actually Robert Jordan is
also quite aggressive in

00:31:59.967 --> 00:32:03.933
making sure that the Spanish can
sometimes feel like they

00:32:03.933 --> 00:32:06.800
don't quite own their
own country.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.667
They don't know how things are
done in their own country.

00:32:10.667 --> 00:32:15.600
Robert has a piece of paper to
prove his credentials, which

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.433
is necessary given the fact
that no one knows

00:32:17.433 --> 00:32:18.500
anything about him.

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.900
So how would people know
he's on their side?

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:25.800
So he has pieces of documents to
prove that he is, in fact,

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.533
well credentialed.

00:32:27.533 --> 00:32:30.700
"He handed it to the man who
opened it, looked at it

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:34.200
doubtfully, and turned
it in his hands.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:38.700
So he cannot read, Robert
Jordan noted.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.800
'Look at the seal,' he said.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:44.600
The old man pointed to the seal,
and the man with the

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:49.100
carbine studied it, turning
it in his fingers.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.600
'What seal is that?' 'Have you
never seen it?' 'No' 'There

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.567
are two,' said Robert Jordan.

00:32:54.567 --> 00:32:58.400
'One is the SIM, the Service of
the Military Intelligence.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.167
The other is the General Staff.'
'Yes, I've seen that

00:33:02.167 --> 00:33:08.300
seal before, but here no one
commands but me,' the man said

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:08.500
solemnly."

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:13.667
So there obviously is a struggle
for authority here.

00:33:13.667 --> 00:33:16.767
It is a shock to us
that Pablo --

00:33:16.767 --> 00:33:21.033
and in fact all the people that
we see in this novel --

00:33:21.033 --> 00:33:25.633
all the Spanish they
are all illiterate.

00:33:25.633 --> 00:33:30.567
And usually we don't even have
to specify it's print

00:33:30.567 --> 00:33:31.867
illiteracy.

00:33:31.867 --> 00:33:36.567
But here it seems especially
important to point it out,

00:33:36.567 --> 00:33:39.733
because they're very literate
in other senses.

00:33:39.733 --> 00:33:48.233
We know that Anselmo actually
speaks a classical Spanish, or

00:33:48.233 --> 00:33:51.600
Castilian Spanish, which is very
pure in this language of

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.833
literature, of Quevedo.

00:33:53.833 --> 00:33:57.667
So they are actually very
literate in the sense of

00:33:57.667 --> 00:34:00.367
having a very, very
distinguished literary

00:34:00.367 --> 00:34:03.533
tradition behind them,
but oral tradition.

00:34:03.533 --> 00:34:06.133
So they can't read writing.

00:34:06.133 --> 00:34:11.533
But obviously in the twentieth
century, early in the

00:34:11.533 --> 00:34:15.233
twentieth century, not to be
able to read and write is a

00:34:15.233 --> 00:34:17.267
tremendous liability.

00:34:17.267 --> 00:34:21.067
So right, there's one strike
against all of these Spanish

00:34:21.067 --> 00:34:24.533
who cannot read their own
language in writing.

00:34:24.533 --> 00:34:27.633
It is Robert, the foreigner, who
can actually read Spanish

00:34:27.633 --> 00:34:30.233
writing, Spanish script.

00:34:30.233 --> 00:34:35.533
But there's another level
of print illiteracy.

00:34:35.533 --> 00:34:39.133
And it goes even beyond
language, in the fact that

00:34:39.133 --> 00:34:42.067
there are two seals
on that document.

00:34:42.067 --> 00:34:45.633
Pablo recognizes only
one of the seals.

00:34:45.633 --> 00:34:47.233
He doesn't recognize
the other one.

00:34:47.233 --> 00:34:49.933
He doesn't recognize the other
one because he's not high

00:34:49.933 --> 00:34:53.800
enough on the military hierarchy
to have come across

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.100
the other seal before.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:00.500
So in many ways, it is Robert's
way of putting him

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.733
down, showing that he actually
has more knowledge of the

00:35:03.733 --> 00:35:08.167
military infrastructure
than Pablo does.

00:35:08.167 --> 00:35:12.300
So that's why Pablo's very
sullen, angry response--

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:16.633
and completely understandable
response-- is no one commands

00:35:16.633 --> 00:35:19.000
here but me.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:19.833
Pablo's hope--

00:35:19.833 --> 00:35:23.700
and actually this is a very
interesting hope--

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:27.233
that will be tested, and I think
to some degree supported

00:35:27.233 --> 00:35:31.500
in the novel, is that it doesn't
really matter how high

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:36.033
up you are on the general
military infrastructure.

00:35:36.033 --> 00:35:39.533
That in many ways, people who
actually know a community well

00:35:39.533 --> 00:35:42.367
would be able to have command
of that community.

00:35:42.367 --> 00:35:45.033
I'm just saying this now
as a possibility.

00:35:45.033 --> 00:35:51.200
But certainly the contest of
authority between Pablo and

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.700
Robert will be played out
throughout the entire novel.

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:56.867
It's one of the most important
structural

00:35:56.867 --> 00:35:58.333
features of this novel.

00:36:02.133 --> 00:36:08.767
But print illiteracy is both
very nameable and it basically

00:36:08.767 --> 00:36:11.033
defines who you are.

00:36:11.033 --> 00:36:13.300
But it's kind of a general
condition.

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:17.433
But there are more specific
instances of illiteracy that I

00:36:17.433 --> 00:36:21.033
would call technological
illiteracy.

00:36:21.033 --> 00:36:24.533
And it has to do with the
high-tech warfare that we've

00:36:24.533 --> 00:36:29.467
seen is also a central feature
of the Spanish Civil War.

00:36:29.467 --> 00:36:30.933
He is talking about--

00:36:30.933 --> 00:36:34.867
And I found myself actually
looking for images for lots of

00:36:34.867 --> 00:36:41.033
military websites to find the
images for these weapons.

00:36:41.033 --> 00:36:45.033
"'Hell, it's a Lewis gun,
Robert Jordan thought.

00:36:45.033 --> 00:36:47.200
'Do you know anything about
a machine gun?' he

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.333
asked the old man.

00:36:48.333 --> 00:36:52.067
'Nada,' said Anselmo.
'Nothing.'" Here is an

00:36:52.067 --> 00:36:55.200
instance of Hemingway doing
instantaneous translation.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.533
"'Nada,' said Anselmo
'Nothing.' 'And

00:36:57.533 --> 00:36:58.933
thou?' to the gypsy.

00:36:58.933 --> 00:37:04.733
'That they fire with such
rapidity and become so hot the

00:37:04.733 --> 00:37:07.600
barracks burn the hand
that touches it.'

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.333
the gypsy said proudly.

00:37:09.333 --> 00:37:14.567
'Unless they jam, run out of
ammunition, or get so hot the

00:37:14.567 --> 00:37:18.733
melt,' Robert Jordan
said in English.

00:37:18.733 --> 00:37:21.233
'What did you say?'
Anselmo asked him.

00:37:21.233 --> 00:37:23.833
'Nothing,' Robert Jordan said.

00:37:23.833 --> 00:37:28.733
'I was only looking into the
future in English.'"

00:37:28.733 --> 00:37:33.333
This is a very aggressive moment
on the side of Robert.

00:37:33.333 --> 00:37:36.400
Every time someone switches into
a language they know the

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.833
other person doesn't understand
it signals

00:37:38.833 --> 00:37:40.000
intentionality.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.200
It signals aggression.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:47.000
But we'll stay away from that
for a moment and just look at

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.367
the Lewis gun.

00:37:49.367 --> 00:37:53.633
This was a major innovation,
actually during World War I.

00:37:53.633 --> 00:37:58.033
It started in World War I. And
it's a very complicated piece

00:37:58.033 --> 00:37:58.733
of machinery.

00:37:58.733 --> 00:38:05.233
So nobody would have
a kind of intuitive

00:38:05.233 --> 00:38:07.100
command of this weapon.

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:09.967
And so here is just
one instance of

00:38:09.967 --> 00:38:11.333
the Lewis gun drill.

00:38:11.333 --> 00:38:13.600
You have to learn
to use the gun.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.033
And we can see it's a
very, very big gun.

00:38:17.033 --> 00:38:18.433
It's very unwieldy.

00:38:18.433 --> 00:38:19.667
It's heavy.

00:38:19.667 --> 00:38:22.167
And also, you just can't
hold it in your hand.

00:38:22.167 --> 00:38:25.333
You have to put it on your
shoulder and carry it around.

00:38:25.333 --> 00:38:30.000
It really is a major hindrance
to any kind of movement.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.067
And here is an image of how
inconvenient actually, what a

00:38:35.067 --> 00:38:38.100
pain it is actually
to use that gun.

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:43.133
It is a weapon that actually
creates, brings, produces that

00:38:43.133 --> 00:38:48.900
facial expression on a person
who is trying to use that gun.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:56.933
So it is understandable that
even Robert Jordan himself

00:38:56.933 --> 00:39:00.800
would take note when he notices
that is a Lewis gun.

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:05.133
That is not just any
ordinary weaponry.

00:39:05.133 --> 00:39:07.000
It's a special kind
of equipment.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.867
And it signals a certain level
of fighting, a certain scale

00:39:10.867 --> 00:39:15.300
of warfare, when the Lewis
gun is involved.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:19.200
And it's because it signals a
certain scale of fighting,

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:23.900
that it's no longer a strictly
local affair, no longer

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:28.300
strictly based on local
knowledge and intuitive use of

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.700
small weapons.

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:34.600
I think that it's because of
all these reasons that he

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:39.700
would suddenly switch to
English, as if just giving

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:46.200
himself the license to think
out loud to himself in a

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.333
different language
at that point.

00:39:49.333 --> 00:39:53.167
He doesn't think very highly of
the Lewis gun, even though

00:39:53.167 --> 00:39:57.900
it's such an impressive looking,
cumbersome weapon.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:01.000
It actually can jam or run
out of ammunition and

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.500
get so hot they melt.

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:06.533
So it's not a great weapon
to use, all around.

00:40:06.533 --> 00:40:08.933
That's part of the reason he's
saying this in English, so

00:40:08.933 --> 00:40:12.300
that the Spanish wouldn't know
all these drawbacks of these

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:15.167
high-tech weapons.

00:40:15.167 --> 00:40:20.800
But also that people who use
the Lewis gun really have a

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:25.667
different relation to the future
than people who don't.

00:40:25.667 --> 00:40:31.433
It's similar in the civilian
setting in the

00:40:31.433 --> 00:40:32.867
twenty-first century.

00:40:32.867 --> 00:40:37.167
People who don't have a computer
at this point, people

00:40:37.167 --> 00:40:40.300
who've never used a computer,
have very different relation

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.900
to the future and to the present
than people who do.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.233
It really is a sharp
dividing line.

00:40:47.233 --> 00:40:51.100
So in the context of the Spanish
Civil War, people who

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:54.067
have never seen the Lewis gun,
have never handled one, have a

00:40:54.067 --> 00:40:56.200
different relation
to the future.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:01.133
So the gun itself is a
kind of a doorkeeper.

00:41:01.133 --> 00:41:05.467
Various people are admitted in
having a viable relation to

00:41:05.467 --> 00:41:09.400
the future and various people
are banned from having a

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.633
viable relation to the future.

00:41:10.633 --> 00:41:13.167
Or they have a very diminished
and marginal

00:41:13.167 --> 00:41:14.500
relation to the future.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:17.367
So the gun is the doorkeeper.

00:41:17.367 --> 00:41:22.033
And the English language, as far
as Robert understands it,

00:41:22.033 --> 00:41:25.000
is lined up with the
gun in that way.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:34.500
The gun is what is
on the ground.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:38.167
And there's another weapon that
has wings that is also

00:41:38.167 --> 00:41:40.767
very important to the
Spanish Civil War.

00:41:40.767 --> 00:41:46.233
And we see the next installment
of this

00:41:46.233 --> 00:41:49.267
technological illiteracy on
the side of the Spanish in

00:41:49.267 --> 00:41:51.667
this exchange.

00:41:51.667 --> 00:41:55.333
"--high in the evening sky,
three monoplanes in V

00:41:55.333 --> 00:42:00.700
formation, showing minute and
silvery at that height where

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:04.833
there still was sun, passing
unbelievably quickly across

00:42:04.833 --> 00:42:08.967
the sky, their motors now
throbbing steadily.

00:42:08.967 --> 00:42:12.567
'Ours?' 'The seem so,' Robert
Jordan said but knew that at

00:42:12.567 --> 00:42:15.233
that height you never
could be sure.

00:42:15.233 --> 00:42:17.700
'They are Moscows,'
Anselmo said.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:21.633
Robert Jordan could have put the
glasses on and been sure

00:42:21.633 --> 00:42:24.533
instantly, but he preferred
not to.

00:42:24.533 --> 00:42:28.133
It made no difference to him who
they were tonight and if

00:42:28.133 --> 00:42:31.667
it pleased the old man to have
them be ours he did not want

00:42:31.667 --> 00:42:33.333
to take them away.

00:42:33.333 --> 00:42:37.333
Now as they moved out of sight
towards Segovia did not look

00:42:37.333 --> 00:42:41.733
to be the green and red wing
tip low wing Russian

00:42:41.733 --> 00:42:45.667
conversion of the Boeing
P32 that the

00:42:45.667 --> 00:42:47.533
Spaniards called Moscows.

00:42:47.533 --> 00:42:51.167
You could not see the colors
but the cut was wrong.

00:42:51.167 --> 00:42:51.600
No.

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.733
It was a Fascist Patrol
coming home."

00:42:55.733 --> 00:42:58.800
So knowledge of airplanes,
knowledge that actually I

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:02.367
think most of us in this room
probably don't have, but

00:43:02.367 --> 00:43:05.633
anyway, this is the Moscow.

00:43:05.633 --> 00:43:08.900
It's a Boeing P32.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:13.300
And I don't know what else to
say about it, except that it

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.633
looks kind of primitive.

00:43:19.967 --> 00:43:23.833
Actually, I did read somewhere
that this is the last of that.

00:43:23.833 --> 00:43:27.900
There were various previous
incarnations, the Boeing P29

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:28.400
or something.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.833
This is the last, and
then Boeing just

00:43:29.833 --> 00:43:31.100
stopped developing this.

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.600
This is the last of the line.

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.033
If we look at actually the
German planes, the Heinkels,

00:43:37.033 --> 00:43:40.533
were very, very effective
bombers.

00:43:40.533 --> 00:43:45.233
They actually look much more
impressive than the Moscows.

00:43:45.233 --> 00:43:49.000
You can see that this is a plane
that anyone can see can

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.400
do serious damage.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:57.700
And here is the Italian Fiat and
Anselmo is to be forgiven

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:02.967
for mistaking the Italian Fiat
for the Boeing P32, because

00:44:02.967 --> 00:44:05.800
actually they are short,
and they are

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.133
kind of clumsy looking.

00:44:08.133 --> 00:44:11.533
And we can see right away that,
even though this is the

00:44:11.533 --> 00:44:15.667
Spanish Civil War, the Nazi
insignia is there.

00:44:15.667 --> 00:44:19.633
So this really is the Second
World War intruding into the

00:44:19.633 --> 00:44:21.233
Spanish Civil War.

00:44:21.233 --> 00:44:25.233
No question that Hemingway is
using the word Fascist in a

00:44:25.233 --> 00:44:28.267
very deliberate way.

00:44:28.267 --> 00:44:34.333
And this is a much more
effective version of the

00:44:34.333 --> 00:44:37.533
Spanish bombers.

00:44:37.533 --> 00:44:44.633
We'll be talking about all
of this and the actual

00:44:44.633 --> 00:44:49.967
destruction of some of the
people in this novel, what the

00:44:49.967 --> 00:44:53.833
bombers, what the Italian
bombers can do to a local

00:44:53.833 --> 00:44:55.667
population.

00:44:55.667 --> 00:45:03.200
But I just want to go back to
that phrase about looking into

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:06.067
the future in English.

00:45:06.067 --> 00:45:09.033
We've talked a lot about
tomorrows and the future,

00:45:09.033 --> 00:45:12.467
beginning with The Sound
and the Fury.

00:45:12.467 --> 00:45:18.500
And the way in which the
tomorrow of Benjy, and the

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:25.433
tomorrow of Jason, and the
tomorrow of Quentin are in

00:45:25.433 --> 00:45:30.167
many ways very pale versions
of the present.

00:45:30.167 --> 00:45:34.633
That it's not a future
that one can inhabit.

00:45:34.633 --> 00:45:40.367
And here it raises the question
of whether the future

00:45:40.367 --> 00:45:45.300
can be inhabited by Spanish
speakers who don't know

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.667
English at all.

00:45:47.667 --> 00:45:53.133
In this context there's just
no way that the Spanish

00:45:53.133 --> 00:45:56.067
could-- note that this local
community, they can't really

00:45:56.067 --> 00:45:58.800
read Spanish in writing--

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:05.700
there's almost no way they can
read the future in English.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:11.067
But it also doesn't feel like
this is a future that, even if

00:46:11.067 --> 00:46:15.833
you were able to read, that
you would want to live in,

00:46:15.833 --> 00:46:20.633
even if you have the ability to
read that future, even if

00:46:20.633 --> 00:46:25.567
that future is writ-large
by the Lewis

00:46:25.567 --> 00:46:28.333
gun and by the planes.

00:46:28.333 --> 00:46:33.700
That is a very legible future,
written on the

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:35.800
sky and on the ground.

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.133
Even though that's such a
legible future and you can

00:46:39.133 --> 00:46:44.333
read it, it might still not be
a future that you would want

00:46:44.333 --> 00:46:47.367
to move into, not a
future that you

00:46:47.367 --> 00:46:49.267
would want to inhabit.

00:46:49.267 --> 00:46:52.367
So this is a way in which
there's also a kind of a

00:46:52.367 --> 00:46:54.800
double alienation going on.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.567
The Spanish are banned from
that future, because they

00:46:57.567 --> 00:46:59.400
simply cannot read it.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.467
It is illegible to them.

00:47:01.467 --> 00:47:06.800
Robert Jordan, who can read
just fine, is also in many

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:11.033
ways, an outsider to that
future because it's not

00:47:11.033 --> 00:47:12.767
anything that he would
like to live in.

00:47:12.767 --> 00:47:15.767
It's not a world that he
would like to live in.

00:47:15.767 --> 00:47:21.900
And I just want to give you
two final images of what

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:26.967
happens to the Spanish
historically because of the

00:47:26.967 --> 00:47:30.967
use of bombers in the
Spanish Civil War.

00:47:30.967 --> 00:47:34.067
This is the most famous town.

00:47:34.067 --> 00:47:38.567
It was completely destroyed by
Italian bombers, Guernica.

00:47:41.633 --> 00:47:51.733
And this is the famous Picasso
painting, and we can see this

00:47:51.733 --> 00:47:56.567
is really the response of
a low-tech population to

00:47:56.567 --> 00:47:58.900
high-tech warfare.

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.900
You've just never seen anything
like that before.

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:03.267
So it is nightmarish.

00:48:03.267 --> 00:48:07.867
It is surreal in the sense that
the world has turned into

00:48:07.867 --> 00:48:10.333
a different kind of reality.

00:48:10.333 --> 00:48:13.933
It just has no relation to
reality as you know it.

00:48:13.933 --> 00:48:15.633
And that's why it is surreal.

00:48:15.633 --> 00:48:20.200
And that's why Cubism is, in
many ways, a response to the

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:24.833
surreal scenarios conjured up
by the high-tech weaponry

00:48:24.833 --> 00:48:26.700
of world wars.

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:31.967
So we'll come back to this and
talk more about, basically,

00:48:31.967 --> 00:48:36.467
the phenomenon of dying both in
isolation but also of dying

00:48:36.467 --> 00:48:38.700
as a result of something
that is large and that

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:39.933
is coming at you.

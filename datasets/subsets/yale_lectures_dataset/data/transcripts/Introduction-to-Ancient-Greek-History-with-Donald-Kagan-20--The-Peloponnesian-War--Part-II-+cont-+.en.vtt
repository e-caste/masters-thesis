00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.240
Professor Donald
Kagan: Why aren't you all

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.260
home like the rest of the class?

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:20.160
My subject today is Pericles as
general.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.070
I don't expect that it will
take up all our time.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.118
So, if you like when I'm
through I'd be glad to respond

00:00:27.118 --> 00:00:31.540
to any questions or comments
that you want to make about the

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.698
Peloponnesian War.
So, if you think of any as I'm

00:00:35.698 --> 00:00:39.210
talking, I hope you'll have a
shot at it.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.205
Near the end of his
biography of Pericles,

00:00:44.205 --> 00:00:50.532
Plutarch describes this great
Athenian leader on his death

00:00:50.532 --> 00:00:54.224
bed.
The best men of Athens and his

00:00:54.224 --> 00:01:00.115
personal friends are gathered in
his room and are discussing the

00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:04.790
greatness of his virtues and the
power he held.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.943
Thinking he was asleep,
they added up his achievements

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:14.424
and the number of his trophies,
for as general he had set up

00:01:14.424 --> 00:01:19.799
nine commemorating a victory on
behalf of the city.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.351
Now, we are inclined to
think of Pericles primarily as a

00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:28.111
great political leader,
a brilliant orator,

00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:33.415
a patron of the arts and
sciences, the man whose work in

00:01:33.415 --> 00:01:39.392
the peaceful arts shaped what is
often called the Golden Age of

00:01:39.392 --> 00:01:42.466
Athens.
So, it's useful for us to

00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:46.683
remember that the office to
which the people elected him

00:01:46.683 --> 00:01:49.980
almost every year for some
thirty years,

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.564
from which he carried on all of
these activities,

00:01:53.564 --> 00:01:58.483
was that of strategos,
a general and that foremost

00:01:58.483 --> 00:02:03.978
responsibility of Athenian
generals was to lead armies and

00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:08.858
navies into battle.
From his own time until modern

00:02:08.858 --> 00:02:14.466
times, Pericles' talents as a
general have been criticized and

00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:17.057
defended.
In the first year of the

00:02:17.057 --> 00:02:19.909
Peloponnesian War,
when his strategy called for

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.566
the Athenians to huddle behind
the walls of their city while

00:02:23.566 --> 00:02:27.720
the invading Peloponnesian army
ravaged their lands in Attica,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.099
Thucydides says the city was
angry with Pericles.

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.661
They abused him,
because as their general he did

00:02:35.661 --> 00:02:40.055
not lead them out into battle
and they held him responsible

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:43.815
for all they were suffering.
In the next year,

00:02:43.815 --> 00:02:47.377
after another invasion and
destruction of their crops and

00:02:47.377 --> 00:02:50.337
farms,
and after a terrible plague had

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:53.649
struck the city,
again, Thucydides says they

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:58.348
blamed Pericles for persuading
them to go to war and they held

00:02:58.348 --> 00:03:01.659
him responsible for their
misfortunes.

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.886
At a lower level,
the poet Hermippus,

00:03:04.886 --> 00:03:09.368
one of the comic poets whose
work we don't have but

00:03:09.368 --> 00:03:14.030
occasionally we have a quotation
and here's one.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.104
Hermippus presented one of his
comedies in the spring of 430,

00:03:18.104 --> 00:03:21.839
the second year of the war,
that simply charged Pericles

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:25.474
with cowardice.
He addresses Pericles as

00:03:25.474 --> 00:03:31.336
follows: "King of the satyrs,
why don't you ever lift a spear

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:36.710
but instead only use dreadful
words to wage the war,

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.470
assuming the character of the
cowardly Telius.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.026
But if a little knife is
sharpened on a wet stone you

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:49.970
roar as though bitten by the
fierce Cleon."

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.402
Cleon, as you know,
was his major opponent in the

00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:59.687
last years of his life and Cleon
was hawkish and an advocate of

00:03:59.687 --> 00:04:04.387
aggressive active fighting.
Now, the title of this talk,

00:04:04.387 --> 00:04:07.913
Pericles as General,
is also the name of the most

00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:11.659
vehement modern attack on
Pericles as a general.

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.461
I say modern,
of course, I'm talking about

00:04:14.461 --> 00:04:17.486
the nineteenth century.
When you're an ancient

00:04:17.486 --> 00:04:20.120
historian things take on those
proportions.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.661
The author, Dr.
Julius von Pflugk-Harttung,

00:04:23.661 --> 00:04:27.541
was a veteran of the
Franco-Prussian war and an

00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:32.854
appreciative student of what he
took to be the lessons taught by

00:04:32.854 --> 00:04:37.829
the great military historian and
theorist Clausewitz.

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:40.941
He believed that he had
acquired some useful knowledge

00:04:40.941 --> 00:04:43.540
of the science of war,
as he put it,

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.666
that led him vigorously and
entirely to condemn Pericles'

00:04:48.666 --> 00:04:51.886
generalship,
and Pericles' conduct of the

00:04:51.886 --> 00:04:55.005
Peloponnesian War.
He says that we see

00:04:55.005 --> 00:04:59.708
expeditions without inner unity,
without the possibility of

00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:03.520
greater results,
and I'm quoting Pflugk-Harttung

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.459
now.
"To avoid danger,

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:09.089
Pericles regularly gave away
important advantages.

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:14.126
Overall, we find the effort to
lose no battle but nowhere to

00:05:14.126 --> 00:05:17.307
win one.
As much as Pericles' personal

00:05:17.307 --> 00:05:21.160
courage operated in battle and
in the assembly,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.278
so little did he have of the
courage proper to a general,

00:05:26.278 --> 00:05:31.304
which boldly risks the life of
thousands at the decisive

00:05:31.304 --> 00:05:34.702
moment.
As such, he belongs to those

00:05:34.702 --> 00:05:39.914
when they say a philosophical
group which brings everything as

00:05:39.914 --> 00:05:43.930
neatly as possible into the
system and plan,

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.699
instead of acting openly and
vigorously.

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:52.334
It is a fact that Pericles,
the chief advocate of the

00:05:52.334 --> 00:05:57.325
anti-Spartan policy never
offered a single battle against

00:05:57.325 --> 00:06:01.195
the Spartans."
At the higher level of

00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:05.899
strategy, the critique of
Pericles is no less severe.

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:11.515
"Pericles was a good minister
of war who made farsighted

00:06:11.515 --> 00:06:14.680
preparations,
but as general,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.337
he did not know how to make
good use of the existing

00:06:18.337 --> 00:06:20.555
situation."
Again I quote,

00:06:20.555 --> 00:06:24.412
"He was a great
burgermeister," this

00:06:24.412 --> 00:06:27.841
means mayor.
It was not a very friendly

00:06:27.841 --> 00:06:31.629
thing to call the great general
who led Athens.

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:35.250
"He was a burgermeister
in the true sense of the word;

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.814
there is the rich many
sidedness of his nature which

00:06:38.814 --> 00:06:41.610
was then by that which came into
play.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.884
His superiority to corruption,
everything petty and paltry,

00:06:46.884 --> 00:06:52.067
yet he lacked the prophet's
vision and the certain luck of

00:06:52.067 --> 00:06:56.500
the borne statesman.
Above all, he lacked the

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:02.034
recklessness which is often
needed to lead what has begun to

00:07:02.034 --> 00:07:06.177
the goal.
As the leader of foreign policy

00:07:06.177 --> 00:07:09.974
he was not comparable to a
Themistocles,

00:07:09.974 --> 00:07:13.770
as a general not even
approximately to a

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.929
Cimon."So,
that's the harshest of the

00:07:17.929 --> 00:07:22.903
critics of Pericles over the
years, but Pericles has been

00:07:22.903 --> 00:07:26.990
very lucky over the years in his
defenders.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.434
In antiquity,
his performance was justified

00:07:30.434 --> 00:07:34.125
and praised by Thucydides,
who was after all a

00:07:34.125 --> 00:07:36.941
contemporary,
a general himself,

00:07:36.941 --> 00:07:41.442
and the historian of the period
whose interpretations have

00:07:41.442 --> 00:07:44.680
dominated opinion ever since he
wrote.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.578
For all the objectivity of
Thucydides' styles,

00:07:48.578 --> 00:07:53.430
he tells the story very much
from Pericles' viewpoint.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.032
For instance,
when he describes the revolt

00:07:56.032 --> 00:07:59.839
against the Athenian leader in
the second year of the war,

00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:03.871
and the Athenians' unsuccessful
effort to make peace,

00:08:03.871 --> 00:08:07.050
this is how he describes the
aftermath.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.539
"Being totally at a loss as
to what to do,

00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:14.339
they -- the Athenian people --
attack Pericles,

00:08:14.339 --> 00:08:18.290
and when he saw that they were
exasperated and doing everything

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.689
as he had anticipated,
he called an assembly,

00:08:21.689 --> 00:08:26.053
since he was still general;
he wanted to put confidence

00:08:26.053 --> 00:08:30.315
into them and leading them away
from their anger to restore

00:08:30.315 --> 00:08:34.756
their calm and their courage."
He reports three of Pericles,

00:08:34.756 --> 00:08:38.718
that is to say Thucydides does,
reports three of Pericles'

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:42.542
speeches at length without
reporting any of the speeches

00:08:42.542 --> 00:08:45.740
made by his opponents on those
occasions,

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.160
with the result that the reader
is made to see the situation

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.889
through Pericles' eyes.
Finally, he makes his own

00:08:52.889 --> 00:08:57.138
judgment perfectly clear;
coming down firmly and

00:08:57.138 --> 00:09:01.920
powerfully on the side of
Pericles and against all of his

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.180
critics.
Here's what Thucydides

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:10.536
says, "As long as he led the
state in peace time he kept to a

00:09:10.536 --> 00:09:13.750
moderate policy and kept it
safe.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:18.277
It was under his leadership
that Athens reached her greatest

00:09:18.277 --> 00:09:22.651
heights, and when the war came
and it appears that he also

00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:27.569
judged its power correctly.
Pericles lived for two years

00:09:27.569 --> 00:09:32.830
and six months after the war
began, and after his death his

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:37.820
foresight about the war was
acknowledged still more.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.678
For he had said that if the
Athenians stayed on the

00:09:41.678 --> 00:09:44.379
defensive, maintained their
navy,

00:09:44.379 --> 00:09:48.726
and did not try to expand their
empire in wartime thereby

00:09:48.726 --> 00:09:52.750
endangering the state,
they would win out.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:57.206
But they acted opposite to his
advice in every way,

00:09:57.206 --> 00:10:02.553
and when their efforts failed
they harmed the state's conduct

00:10:02.553 --> 00:10:05.913
of the war."
Now, in spite of his

00:10:05.913 --> 00:10:10.827
successor's departure from his
strategy and the disasters that

00:10:10.827 --> 00:10:15.660
resulted in spite of the entry
of the Persian Empire into the

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.593
enemy ranks,
the Athenians held out for ten

00:10:19.593 --> 00:10:24.122
years after the disastrous
Sicilian Expedition and for

00:10:24.122 --> 00:10:28.480
twenty-seven years with
interruption altogether.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.568
Here's Thucydides final word on
this subject,

00:10:32.568 --> 00:10:37.678
"So more than abundant was
Pericles' reasons for his own

00:10:37.678 --> 00:10:43.068
predictions that Athens would
have won in a war against the

00:10:43.068 --> 00:10:47.599
Peloponnesians alone."
Thucydides makes it absolutely

00:10:47.599 --> 00:10:49.934
clear;
Pericles was right in the

00:10:49.934 --> 00:10:54.381
strategy that he had adopted,
and if the Athenians had stuck

00:10:54.381 --> 00:10:57.169
to it they would have won the
war.

00:10:57.169 --> 00:11:00.997
Plutarch accepted Thucydides'
judgment and added further

00:11:00.997 --> 00:11:05.311
defense against the charges of
cowardice and lack of enterprise

00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:09.000
that his enemies were launching
against Pericles.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.129
To Plutarch,
the actions that provoked such

00:11:13.129 --> 00:11:16.720
accusations instead revealed
prudence,

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.900
moderation, and a desire to
protect the safety of Athenian

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.636
soldiers.
In 454, we're back now in the

00:11:25.636 --> 00:11:30.070
first Peloponnesian War,
Pericles led a seaborne

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.750
expedition into the Corinthian
Gulf.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:38.194
Thucydides merely reports that
he defeated the Sicyonians in

00:11:38.194 --> 00:11:42.940
battle and ravaged the territory
and besieged the important city

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.663
of Oeniada,
though he failed to take it and

00:11:46.663 --> 00:11:50.132
then sailed home.
Obviously, answering later

00:11:50.132 --> 00:11:54.584
criticism, Plutarch concludes
his account of these events by

00:11:54.584 --> 00:11:57.830
saying that Pericles returned to
Athens,

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:01.764
and now I quote him,
"Having showed himself to be

00:12:01.764 --> 00:12:06.682
formidable to the enemy but a
safe and effective commander to

00:12:06.682 --> 00:12:11.234
his fellow citizens,
for no misfortune struck the

00:12:11.234 --> 00:12:16.088
men on the expedition."
In 437, he sailed into the

00:12:16.088 --> 00:12:20.660
Black Sea on a mission of
imperial consolidation that

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:25.673
amounted to little more than
showing the flag to the local

00:12:25.673 --> 00:12:28.577
barbarians.
An action that was too

00:12:28.577 --> 00:12:31.708
insignificant to be even noticed
by Thucydides,

00:12:31.708 --> 00:12:35.656
but Plutarch does not miss the
chance to meet the criticism

00:12:35.656 --> 00:12:38.720
that had been directed against
his hero.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.494
On this campaign,
according to Plutarch,

00:12:41.494 --> 00:12:45.265
Pericles displayed the
magnitude of his forces and the

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:49.249
fearlessness and confident
courage with which they sailed

00:12:49.249 --> 00:12:53.233
wherever they liked and placed
the entire sea under their

00:12:53.233 --> 00:12:56.401
power.
In 446, when Boeotia was in

00:12:56.401 --> 00:13:00.342
rebellion, the bold and
ambitious General Tolmides

00:13:00.342 --> 00:13:05.088
convinced the assembly to send
him at the head of an army to

00:13:05.088 --> 00:13:09.571
put down the uprising.
Plutarch reports that

00:13:09.571 --> 00:13:14.750
Pericles tried to restrain and
to persuade him to end the

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.944
assembly,
making his famous remark that

00:13:17.944 --> 00:13:21.897
if he would not listen to
Pericles he would not go wrong

00:13:21.897 --> 00:13:25.622
in waiting for time,
the wisest counselor,

00:13:25.622 --> 00:13:31.445
but Tolmides didn't listen and
he went, and the result was a

00:13:31.445 --> 00:13:34.724
disaster.
The Athenians suffered many

00:13:34.724 --> 00:13:38.990
casualties, Tolmides was killed,
and Boeotia was lost.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:44.031
Plutarch's comment is that this
incident brought great fame and

00:13:44.031 --> 00:13:48.830
goodwill to Pericles as a man of
prudence and patriotism.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:53.529
Later in the same year,
rebellion broke out in Euboea

00:13:53.529 --> 00:13:58.501
and Megara revolted opening the
road for a Peloponnesian

00:13:58.501 --> 00:14:02.497
invasion of Attica.
Pericles, on this occasion had

00:14:02.497 --> 00:14:05.078
no choice;
he led an Athenian army out to

00:14:05.078 --> 00:14:08.085
meet the invading army,
but instead of fighting a

00:14:08.085 --> 00:14:11.529
battle he convinced the Spartans
to withdraw and then to

00:14:11.529 --> 00:14:14.174
negotiate a peace.
In retrospect,

00:14:14.174 --> 00:14:17.923
no doubt, his critics accused
him of missing a chance for

00:14:17.923 --> 00:14:21.342
victory in the field.
Thucydides reports the

00:14:21.342 --> 00:14:26.039
Peloponnesian withdrawal without
comment or explanation.

00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:30.768
But Plutarch uses this action
to respond in almost poetic

00:14:30.768 --> 00:14:35.581
language to later charges that
accompany the Peloponnesian

00:14:35.581 --> 00:14:39.510
invasion in 431.
Reporting that his enemies,

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:43.327
Pericles' enemies,
threatened and denounced him

00:14:43.327 --> 00:14:47.309
and choruses sang mocking songs
to his shame,

00:14:47.309 --> 00:14:52.074
and insulted his generalship
for its cowardice and for

00:14:52.074 --> 00:14:55.399
abandoning everything to the
enemy.

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:58.230
The Peloponnesians,
Plutarch tells us,

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:02.590
expected the Athenians to fight
out of anger and pride.

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:06.903
But to Pericles,
it appeared terrible to fight a

00:15:06.903 --> 00:15:11.216
battle against 60,000
Peloponnesian and Boeotian

00:15:11.216 --> 00:15:13.927
hoplites,
for that was the number of

00:15:13.927 --> 00:15:15.970
those who made the first
invasion.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:21.633
I'm still quoting Plutarch,
and to stake the city itself on

00:15:21.633 --> 00:15:25.003
the outcome.
He reports Pericles'

00:15:25.003 --> 00:15:29.928
calming language to the excited
Athenians in 431 saying that

00:15:29.928 --> 00:15:32.726
trees,
though cut and lopped,

00:15:32.726 --> 00:15:36.541
grew quickly,
but if men were destroyed it

00:15:36.541 --> 00:15:40.169
was not easy to get them back
again.

00:15:40.169 --> 00:15:43.990
Here he turned to the charges
of cowardice and lack of

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:48.243
enterprise and he turned them on
their heads and did so more

00:15:48.243 --> 00:15:51.992
fully in a passage that sums up
his view of Pericles'

00:15:51.992 --> 00:15:55.100
generalship,
and I'll read it to you.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:59.489
"In his generalship he was
especially famous for his

00:15:59.489 --> 00:16:03.084
caution.
He never willingly undertook a

00:16:03.084 --> 00:16:07.460
battle that involved great risk
or uncertainty,

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:11.841
nor did he envy or emulate
those who took great risks with

00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:16.070
brilliant success and were
admired as great generals.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:21.389
He always said to his fellow
citizens that as far as it was

00:16:21.389 --> 00:16:25.334
in his power,
they would live forever and be

00:16:25.334 --> 00:16:29.190
immortals."
Of the many modern scholars who

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:33.429
have been persuaded by this
view, none has argued more

00:16:33.429 --> 00:16:38.789
forcefully in favor of Pericles'
generalship than Hans Delbruck,

00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:43.101
perhaps the most renowned
military historian of his day,

00:16:43.101 --> 00:16:46.629
and still a respected figure in
that field.

00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:49.715
He and Pflugk-Harttung were
contemporaries,

00:16:49.715 --> 00:16:53.388
they lived in--well,
they did their writing on this

00:16:53.388 --> 00:16:57.649
subject in the last decades of
the nineteenth century.

00:16:57.649 --> 00:17:01.611
Annoyed by the critiques
rather, lately leveled at

00:17:01.611 --> 00:17:05.250
Pericles and especially by
Pflugk-Harttung,

00:17:08.559 --> 00:17:12.844
he wrote a thorough defense in
1890 under the title,

00:17:12.844 --> 00:17:17.127
The Generalship of Pericles
Explained Through the

00:17:17.127 --> 00:17:20.740
Generalship of Frederick the
Great.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:26.473
His main effort and at work
is to justify Pericles' conduct

00:17:26.473 --> 00:17:31.206
of the war that began in 431,
the subject of the greatest

00:17:31.206 --> 00:17:34.180
criticism leveled at the
Athenian general.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:39.395
Pericles' strategy did not aim
at defeating the Spartans in

00:17:39.395 --> 00:17:44.251
battle, but was meant to
convince them that war against

00:17:44.251 --> 00:17:47.833
Athens was futile.
His strategic goals,

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:50.720
therefore, were entirely
defensive.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.476
He told the Athenians that if
they would remain quiet,

00:17:54.476 --> 00:17:58.307
take care of their fleet,
refrain from trying to extend

00:17:58.307 --> 00:18:02.340
their empire in wartime and so
putting their city in danger,

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:06.343
they would prevail.
The Athenians were to reject

00:18:06.343 --> 00:18:09.724
battle on land,
abandon their fields and homes

00:18:09.724 --> 00:18:13.932
in the country to Spartan
devastation, and retreat behind

00:18:13.932 --> 00:18:17.492
their walls.
Meanwhile, their navy would

00:18:17.492 --> 00:18:21.887
launch a series of commando
raids on the coast of the

00:18:21.887 --> 00:18:24.672
Peloponnesus.
This strategy would

00:18:24.672 --> 00:18:28.099
continue until the frustrated
enemy was prepared to make

00:18:28.099 --> 00:18:30.782
peace.
The naval raids and landings

00:18:30.782 --> 00:18:35.103
were not meant to do serious
harm, but merely to annoy the

00:18:35.103 --> 00:18:39.880
enemy and to suggest how much
damage the Athenians could do,

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.909
if they chose.
The strategy was not to exhaust

00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:49.230
the Peloponnesians physically or
materially, but psychologically.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:54.106
No such strategy had ever been
attempted in Greek history,

00:18:54.106 --> 00:18:58.726
for no state before the coming
of the Athenian imperial

00:18:58.726 --> 00:19:03.860
democracy ever had the means for
trying such a strategy.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:08.806
To do so was not easy.
For this unprecedented strategy

00:19:08.806 --> 00:19:12.391
ran directly across the grain,
as you know,

00:19:12.391 --> 00:19:16.072
of Greek tradition.
Willingness to fight,

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:20.963
bravery, and steadfastness in
battle, became the essential

00:19:20.963 --> 00:19:25.339
characteristics of the free man
and the citizen.

00:19:25.339 --> 00:19:28.866
Pericles' strategy of
passivity, therefore,

00:19:28.866 --> 00:19:33.400
ran counter to the teachings of
the Greek tradition.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:38.550
But most Athenians were
farmers, whose lands and homes

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:43.857
were outside the walls.
The Periclean strategy required

00:19:43.857 --> 00:19:48.379
them to look on idly while their
houses, crops,

00:19:48.379 --> 00:19:54.769
and vines, and olive trees were
damaged or entirely destroyed.

00:19:54.769 --> 00:19:58.867
In the face of these facts,
as well as of the power of

00:19:58.867 --> 00:20:02.809
tradition, and the cultural
values of the Greeks,

00:20:02.809 --> 00:20:07.825
it is hard to understand even
in retrospect how Pericles could

00:20:07.825 --> 00:20:11.690
convince the Athenians to adopt
his strategy.

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:16.691
Delbruck keenly aware of
Athens' numerical inferiority on

00:20:16.691 --> 00:20:22.049
land was convinced of the
soundness of Pericles' approach.

00:20:22.049 --> 00:20:25.595
Here's what Delbruck wrote,
"The structure of the

00:20:25.595 --> 00:20:29.754
Peloponnesian War obliges us to
give him a position not simply

00:20:29.754 --> 00:20:33.707
among the great statesmen,
but also among the great

00:20:33.707 --> 00:20:36.490
military leaders of world
history.

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:41.273
It is not his war plan as such
that bestows this right on him,

00:20:41.273 --> 00:20:45.744
for the fame of the commander
is gained not by word but by

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:48.886
deed,
but rather the gigantic power

00:20:48.886 --> 00:20:54.296
of decision that accompanied it.
Not to halt with a half measure

00:20:54.296 --> 00:20:59.568
but to plunge in whole heartedly
and to give up completely what

00:20:59.568 --> 00:21:04.329
had to be sacrificed -- the
entire Attic countryside.

00:21:04.329 --> 00:21:06.941
In addition,
the strength of personal

00:21:06.941 --> 00:21:11.365
authority that was able to make
such a decision understandable

00:21:11.365 --> 00:21:14.992
to a democratic national
assembly and to gain their

00:21:14.992 --> 00:21:19.296
approval.
The execution of this decision

00:21:19.296 --> 00:21:25.513
is a strategic deed that can be
compared favorably with any

00:21:25.513 --> 00:21:29.579
victory."
Take that, critics.

00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:35.154
Delbruck was pulling no punches
and if you said he was a bum I

00:21:35.154 --> 00:21:39.559
say he was the greatest.
Delbruck tries to bolster his

00:21:39.559 --> 00:21:43.130
case by comparing Pericles with
Frederick the Great,

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:46.279
King of Prussia in the
eighteenth century.

00:21:46.279 --> 00:21:50.920
During the Seven Years' War
Frederick applied what Delbruck

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.649
calls a strategy of exhaustion;
instead of the strategy of

00:21:55.649 --> 00:22:00.551
annihilation in which one army
seeks out the other to bring it

00:22:00.551 --> 00:22:05.211
to decisive battle with the goal
of destroying its nation's

00:22:05.211 --> 00:22:09.835
ability to resist.
Such a strategy is sometimes

00:22:09.835 --> 00:22:15.288
adopted by or forced upon the
weaker side in a conflict,

00:22:15.288 --> 00:22:19.650
because no other choice
promises success.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:23.425
In the twentieth century,
the North Vietnamese communists

00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:26.730
used it with success against the
United States.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:30.638
Superior fire power brought the
Americans victory in set

00:22:30.638 --> 00:22:34.049
battles, but was not so
effective in dealing with

00:22:34.049 --> 00:22:36.750
various forms of guerilla
warfare.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.930
The communists,
therefore, usually avoided

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:44.407
battles throughout the war.
Continuing warfare over years

00:22:44.407 --> 00:22:48.631
without a decisive result fed
division and discontent in

00:22:48.631 --> 00:22:53.470
America and ultimately exhausted
the American will to fight.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:58.042
In the Second Punic War,
Rome repeatedly suffered

00:22:58.042 --> 00:23:02.789
crushing defeats in battle at
the hands of Hannibal.

00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:06.587
The Romans, therefore,
chose the tactics of Quintus

00:23:06.587 --> 00:23:09.170
Fabius Maximus,
avoiding battle,

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:12.657
harassing the enemy with
guerilla warfare,

00:23:12.657 --> 00:23:15.549
until they grew stronger and
he,

00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:20.785
far from home and cut off from
it by sea, grew weaker and was

00:23:20.785 --> 00:23:24.891
compelled to withdraw.
Pericles' strategy,

00:23:24.891 --> 00:23:30.289
however, was unlike these
strategies in many ways.

00:23:30.289 --> 00:23:34.250
Unlike the Vietnamese
communists and the Romans,

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:37.789
he never attempted a set battle
on land.

00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:41.404
The Vietnamese wore down
America's resolve by inflicting

00:23:41.404 --> 00:23:45.815
casualties on their forces.
The Romans avoided battle only

00:23:45.815 --> 00:23:49.759
so long as they had to.
Their ultimate aim was to

00:23:49.759 --> 00:23:54.335
defeat the enemy in standard
battles, which finally they did

00:23:54.335 --> 00:23:56.740
in Italy, Spain,
and Africa.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:01.754
Delbruck's comparison with
Frederick's strategy seems to me

00:24:01.754 --> 00:24:05.414
no less faulty.
The Prussian Monarch was driven

00:24:05.414 --> 00:24:09.688
to it by combat losses in set
battles fought over two years

00:24:09.688 --> 00:24:12.710
and by the absence of any
alternative.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:16.519
He needed to avoid battle to
survive.

00:24:16.519 --> 00:24:21.181
Only good fortune,
not calculated war plans could

00:24:21.181 --> 00:24:24.177
save him.
Britain came to his aid with

00:24:24.177 --> 00:24:28.101
financial assistance and then
the most incalculable of all

00:24:28.101 --> 00:24:31.480
things happened,
the death of the Russian

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:36.311
Empress who was a great fan,
who was hostile to Frederick

00:24:36.311 --> 00:24:41.400
broke up the coalition of his
enemies allowing him to escape

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:46.425
from the war unbeaten;
she was succeeded by a czar who

00:24:46.425 --> 00:24:51.119
loved Frederick the Great and
thereby saved his neck.

00:24:51.119 --> 00:24:55.904
The situation confronting
Pericles was entirely different

00:24:55.904 --> 00:25:00.348
from these cases.
No helpful allies stood in the

00:25:00.348 --> 00:25:06.400
wings and no fortunate accident
came to divide his opponents.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.142
Since he avoided all fighting
on land against the Spartans,

00:25:11.142 --> 00:25:15.393
he inflicted no casualties,
as the Vietnamese and the

00:25:15.393 --> 00:25:18.595
Romans did.
They and Frederick moreover,

00:25:18.595 --> 00:25:22.687
aimed finally at fighting and
winning battles when the odds

00:25:22.687 --> 00:25:26.382
were in their favor.
The core of Pericles' plan,

00:25:26.382 --> 00:25:30.528
however, was to avoid all land
battles to show that the

00:25:30.528 --> 00:25:35.134
Peloponnesians could do Athens
no serious harm and to exhaust

00:25:35.134 --> 00:25:39.051
them psychologically,
to make them see reason and

00:25:39.051 --> 00:25:43.321
understand that their efforts
were futile and could not bring

00:25:43.321 --> 00:25:48.630
them victory.
His plan did not work.

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:53.057
The element of chance,
the unexpected and incalculable

00:25:53.057 --> 00:25:58.069
intervened against Pericles and
against Athens in the form of

00:25:58.069 --> 00:26:02.748
the terrible plague that
ultimately killed a third of the

00:26:02.748 --> 00:26:05.834
Athenian population.
Of course,

00:26:05.834 --> 00:26:09.427
all this encouraged the
Peloponnesians who refused to be

00:26:09.427 --> 00:26:11.910
discouraged and continued to
fight.

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:17.410
When Pericles died in 429 the
Athenian treasury was running

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:22.721
dry, his plan lay in ruins,
and there was no prospect for

00:26:22.721 --> 00:26:26.449
victory.
Only when his successors turned

00:26:26.449 --> 00:26:31.128
to a more aggressive strategy
did the Athenians level the

00:26:31.128 --> 00:26:34.470
playing field and achieve a
position,

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.696
which allowed them to hold out
for twenty-seven years,

00:26:37.696 --> 00:26:40.070
and indeed on more than one
occasion,

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:44.120
almost brought victory.
So, it's not surprising that

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:48.017
Pericles' strategy in the
Peloponnesian War has brought

00:26:48.017 --> 00:26:52.564
criticism that raises questions
about his capacity as a military

00:26:52.564 --> 00:26:56.451
leader,
even from sober and friendly

00:26:56.451 --> 00:26:58.502
scholars.
Georg Busolt,

00:26:58.502 --> 00:27:02.915
a very distinguished German
historian, regarded his strategy

00:27:02.915 --> 00:27:07.488
as fundamentally right,
but even he thought that it was

00:27:07.488 --> 00:27:11.303
somewhat one-sided and
doctrinaire, and in its

00:27:11.303 --> 00:27:16.135
execution it was lacking an
energetic procedure and in the

00:27:16.135 --> 00:27:20.599
spirit of enterprise;
that's from a very good friend.

00:27:20.599 --> 00:27:23.632
Hermann Bengston,
as you can see,

00:27:23.632 --> 00:27:28.769
the Germans have dominated this
entire field of discussion,

00:27:28.769 --> 00:27:33.744
defends the plan against its
critics, but concedes that the

00:27:33.744 --> 00:27:38.548
carrying out of the offensive
part of the plan appears to

00:27:38.548 --> 00:27:43.180
modern viewers as not very
energetic and resolute;

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:46.774
I'll say.
Their influence no doubt,

00:27:46.774 --> 00:27:50.036
these critics are,
by the knowledge that Pericles'

00:27:50.036 --> 00:27:53.830
successors took some actions
that did not risk significant

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:56.559
land battles or numerous
casualties,

00:27:56.559 --> 00:27:59.559
and yet produced important
successes.

00:27:59.559 --> 00:28:03.314
In the spring of 425,
the brilliant and daring

00:28:03.314 --> 00:28:07.401
general Demosthenes,
conceived and executed a plan

00:28:07.401 --> 00:28:11.572
to seize and fortify the
promontory of Pylos at the

00:28:11.572 --> 00:28:15.160
southwestern tip of the
Peloponnesus.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.936
From there, the Athenians could
launch raids at will and

00:28:18.936 --> 00:28:22.163
encourage the escape or
rebellion of the helots,

00:28:22.163 --> 00:28:26.209
Sparta's enslaved population.
His success panicked the

00:28:26.209 --> 00:28:30.437
Spartans who allowed several
hundred of their troops to be

00:28:30.437 --> 00:28:33.996
trapped and captured on the
Island of Sphacteria,

00:28:33.996 --> 00:28:38.197
just off Pylos.
He immediately proposed a

00:28:38.197 --> 00:28:42.039
peace, which the Athenians then
refused.

00:28:42.039 --> 00:28:45.747
Later in the same spring,
the Athenians seized and

00:28:45.747 --> 00:28:50.590
garrisoned the Island of Cythera
just off the southeastern tip of

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:54.282
the Peloponnesus,
and immediately they began to

00:28:54.282 --> 00:28:56.819
launch raids against the
mainland.

00:28:56.819 --> 00:29:01.033
Thucydides reports that the
Spartans suffered what I think

00:29:01.033 --> 00:29:03.990
of as pretty much a nervous
breakdown.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:06.575
Here's the account
Thucydides gives,

00:29:06.575 --> 00:29:10.354
"The Spartans sent garrisons
here and there throughout the

00:29:10.354 --> 00:29:13.210
country,
deciding the number of hoplites

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:15.869
by what seemed necessary at each
place.

00:29:15.869 --> 00:29:18.664
In other respects,
they were very much on guard

00:29:18.664 --> 00:29:21.823
for fear that there would be a
revolution against the

00:29:21.823 --> 00:29:25.313
established order,
and from every direction a war

00:29:25.313 --> 00:29:29.549
rose up around them which was
swift and defied precaution.

00:29:29.549 --> 00:29:33.960
In military affairs they now
became more timid than ever

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:39.011
before since they were involved
in a naval contest outside their

00:29:39.011 --> 00:29:42.700
normal conceptions of
preparation for war,

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:46.349
and in this unaccustomed area
they fought against the

00:29:46.349 --> 00:29:50.489
Athenians to whom the omission
of an enterprise was always a

00:29:50.489 --> 00:29:54.559
loss in respect to what they had
expected to achieve."

00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:56.310
In other words,
whatever victories the

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:57.634
Athenians won,
however great,

00:29:57.634 --> 00:30:00.473
they were always disappointed,
because they had expected more

00:30:00.473 --> 00:30:02.589
than that.
At the same time the

00:30:02.589 --> 00:30:05.307
misfortunes that had struck them
in such numbers,

00:30:05.307 --> 00:30:07.630
unexpectedly and in such a
short time,

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:12.424
caused great terror and they
were afraid, the Spartans were,

00:30:12.424 --> 00:30:17.220
that another calamity might
against strike them sometime,

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:19.559
like the one on the island of
Spachteria.

00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:23.158
For this reason they were less
daring in going into battle,

00:30:23.158 --> 00:30:26.819
and they thought that whatever
they undertook would turn out

00:30:26.819 --> 00:30:29.141
badly,
because they had no self

00:30:29.141 --> 00:30:33.607
confidence as a result of having
little previous experience with

00:30:33.607 --> 00:30:36.079
misfortune.
Let me just remind you of the

00:30:36.079 --> 00:30:39.090
enormous confidence with which
they entered the war thinking

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:41.029
that it would be no problem at
all,

00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:43.712
all they had to do was walk
into Attica, and either the

00:30:43.712 --> 00:30:46.593
Athenians would come out to
fight them as they had done the

00:30:46.593 --> 00:30:48.730
last time and be destroyed
immediately,

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:52.716
or they would surrender rather
than see their lands destroyed

00:30:52.716 --> 00:30:55.440
and look to what they had been
reduced,

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:59.659
not by Pericles' strategy of
exhaustion, but by the rejection

00:30:59.659 --> 00:31:04.160
of that strategy and the effort
at a more aggressive approach.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:09.208
In the light of results
such as these,

00:31:09.208 --> 00:31:16.227
it is natural to ask why did
the enterprises that produced

00:31:16.227 --> 00:31:20.801
these successes,
why did they need to wait until

00:31:20.801 --> 00:31:25.413
the fifth year of the war?
Why didn't Pericles use them at

00:31:25.413 --> 00:31:28.463
once?
His failure to do so is the

00:31:28.463 --> 00:31:32.840
most weighty of the charges
brought against him,

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:38.519
and Delbruck uses much effort
and ingenuity to defend him.

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:41.444
He is forced to concede,
however, that a more

00:31:41.444 --> 00:31:45.099
aggressive, offensive effort
would have been helpful.

00:31:45.099 --> 00:31:49.056
He believes that the attack
Pericles led against Epidaurus

00:31:49.056 --> 00:31:53.151
in the second year of the war,
in 430, was meant to take and

00:31:53.151 --> 00:31:55.983
hold that city.
Quote from Delbruck,

00:31:55.983 --> 00:31:59.766
"If any such conquest had
succeeded, any success in

00:31:59.766 --> 00:32:02.932
Acarnania,
any campaign of devastation,

00:32:02.932 --> 00:32:06.673
however intensive,
any fortification of a coastal

00:32:06.673 --> 00:32:10.569
spot in Mycenae would disappear
in comparison."

00:32:10.569 --> 00:32:13.146
Taking Epidaurus,
he says, would have threatened

00:32:13.146 --> 00:32:15.339
the neighboring states near the
coast,

00:32:15.339 --> 00:32:20.199
it might bring peace at once,
or at least cool the ardor for

00:32:20.199 --> 00:32:25.274
war amongst Sparta's allies.
So, why did Pericles wait

00:32:25.274 --> 00:32:31.484
and then do so little?
Delbruck's answer is "we do not

00:32:31.484 --> 00:32:34.496
know."
The failure by so learned,

00:32:34.496 --> 00:32:38.648
clever, and determined a
scholar and by as many other

00:32:38.648 --> 00:32:43.039
defenders to explain Pericles'
behavior in this way,

00:32:43.039 --> 00:32:47.457
I think, is a powerful sign
that they have taken the wrong

00:32:47.457 --> 00:32:50.185
path.
Pericles did not mean to use

00:32:50.185 --> 00:32:55.023
any serious offensive measures
to wear down the enemy's ability

00:32:55.023 --> 00:32:57.700
to fight.
His goal, as I have said

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.890
before, was psychological and
intellectual.

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:05.072
To convince the Spartans and
their allies that victory was

00:33:05.072 --> 00:33:09.401
impossible, that the Athenians
could easily sustain the only

00:33:09.401 --> 00:33:15.182
damage the enemy could inflict,
the ravishing of Attica,

00:33:15.182 --> 00:33:22.947
and to show to them and the
allies that the Athenians could

00:33:22.947 --> 00:33:28.250
do them considerable harm,
if they chose.

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:33.461
Athens' carefully calculated
limited offensive efforts were

00:33:33.461 --> 00:33:38.404
meant to deliver a message
without inciting the enemy to

00:33:38.404 --> 00:33:43.355
fight and to fight harder.
Just as the carefully

00:33:43.355 --> 00:33:48.587
calculated limited attacks by
American forces against North

00:33:48.587 --> 00:33:51.623
Vietnam,
aimed at putting pressure on

00:33:51.623 --> 00:33:56.440
the enemy, without causing their
Chinese supporters to intervene,

00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:02.019
that kind of strategy calls for
very delicate action and very

00:34:02.019 --> 00:34:05.519
delicate judgment,
and of course there's no

00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:10.902
guarantee that it would work.
The offensive part of Pericles'

00:34:10.902 --> 00:34:15.309
plan was deliberately to do
little harm.

00:34:15.309 --> 00:34:20.291
For actions that were too
aggressive might anger the enemy

00:34:20.291 --> 00:34:25.509
and harden his determination.
The goal was to depress the

00:34:25.509 --> 00:34:30.994
enemies' spirit by showing that
there was no way for them to

00:34:30.994 --> 00:34:34.619
win, to destroy their will to
fight.

00:34:34.619 --> 00:34:39.059
Just a little footnote here,
that's always a critical issue

00:34:39.059 --> 00:34:43.269
in any strategy that anybody
adopts in a war--really,

00:34:43.269 --> 00:34:50.908
the two fundamental goals and
they do not always produce the

00:34:50.908 --> 00:34:55.087
same strategy.
One is to make it impossible

00:34:55.087 --> 00:34:58.776
for the enemy to fight,
to destroy his capacity to

00:34:58.776 --> 00:35:02.539
fight, if you do that you have
certain victory.

00:35:02.539 --> 00:35:05.884
The other is to destroy his
will to fight,

00:35:05.884 --> 00:35:10.779
and of course if you do that
you win, but his will may not be

00:35:10.779 --> 00:35:13.390
responsive to your approach.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.518
If they could destroy the
Spartan will,

00:35:19.518 --> 00:35:23.196
they could be expected to make
a negotiated peace that would

00:35:23.196 --> 00:35:25.940
return to the status quo before
the war,

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:31.594
only made more secure by the
demonstration that it could not

00:35:31.594 --> 00:35:37.205
be overthrown by force.
That was Pericles' aim in the

00:35:37.205 --> 00:35:39.980
war.
That strategy failed,

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:46.111
as had Pericles' diplomatic
maneuvers in the period leading

00:35:46.111 --> 00:35:50.852
to war from 433 to 431.
When civil war in Epidamnus,

00:35:50.852 --> 00:35:54.340
a remote town on the fringes of
the Greek world,

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.843
threatened to bring a great war
between the Peloponnesian League

00:35:57.843 --> 00:36:02.127
and the Athenian Empire,
Pericles, as I have argued to

00:36:02.127 --> 00:36:07.606
you, pursued a policy of
restrained, limited intervention

00:36:07.606 --> 00:36:12.271
meant to deter Corinth,
Sparta's important ally without

00:36:12.271 --> 00:36:16.307
driving the Spartans and all
their Peloponnesian allies into

00:36:16.307 --> 00:36:20.208
a war against Athens.
That effort also failed,

00:36:20.208 --> 00:36:25.572
and resulted in a terrible war
that Pericles had wanted to

00:36:25.572 --> 00:36:29.188
avoid.
Do these great strategic

00:36:29.188 --> 00:36:34.329
failures fully make the case for
Pericles' critics?

00:36:34.329 --> 00:36:38.610
Were they the result of
cowardice, lack of enterprise

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:42.063
and resolution?
I think that a fair examination

00:36:42.063 --> 00:36:45.838
of his performance throughout
his life as general suggests

00:36:45.838 --> 00:36:48.585
otherwise.
The charge of personal

00:36:48.585 --> 00:36:53.042
cowardice is ludicrous,
even Pflugk-Harttung concedes

00:36:53.042 --> 00:36:57.670
that his personal courage
operated in battle and in the

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:00.817
assembly.
No Athenian who led armies and

00:37:00.817 --> 00:37:04.193
navies in many battles
repeatedly setting up trophies

00:37:04.193 --> 00:37:07.179
of victory could have escaped
condemnation,

00:37:07.179 --> 00:37:10.526
had he shown any sign of
cowardice, nor could he have

00:37:10.526 --> 00:37:13.230
been re-elected general year
after year,

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:18.426
if that was the picture of him.
Nor did he fail to demonstrate

00:37:18.426 --> 00:37:23.496
boldness and enterprise.
In 446, the very survival

00:37:23.496 --> 00:37:27.849
of Athens and her empire were
threatened.

00:37:27.849 --> 00:37:32.010
The most menacing rebellions
broke out close to home,

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.650
in Euboea, Megara,
and Boeotia.

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:38.966
Pericles swiftly took an army
to put down the Euboean

00:37:38.966 --> 00:37:44.280
rebellion, and just as swiftly
withdrew on news of the second,

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.365
which opened the door to a
Peloponnesian invasion of

00:37:47.365 --> 00:37:49.612
Attica.
He arrived, you remember,

00:37:49.612 --> 00:37:53.699
just in time to persuade the
Spartans to withdraw and then he

00:37:53.699 --> 00:37:57.989
returned at once to Euboea to
suppress the rebellions there.

00:37:57.989 --> 00:38:02.685
Again, when the island of Samos
launched a dangerous rebellion

00:38:02.685 --> 00:38:06.150
back in 440, Pericles took
personal charge,

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:10.935
acting promptly and decisively,
and catching the Samian rebels

00:38:10.935 --> 00:38:13.760
unprepared for his swift
reaction,

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:17.886
taking them by surprise,
ultimately forcing them to

00:38:17.886 --> 00:38:21.269
surrender by means of a naval
blockade.

00:38:21.269 --> 00:38:25.900
These expeditions,
however, show that Pericles'

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:31.364
frequent caution did not derive
chiefly from a temperamental

00:38:31.364 --> 00:38:37.032
tendency or a character flaw,
but from thought and

00:38:37.032 --> 00:38:41.865
calculation.
The main reason he avoided land

00:38:41.865 --> 00:38:47.530
battles against their Spartan
and Peloponnesian allies is

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:53.244
because he was certain to lose;
the numbers were decisively

00:38:53.244 --> 00:38:57.239
against him.
Yet, he was more careful than

00:38:57.239 --> 00:39:01.348
were bolder generals.
No polis in the Greek

00:39:01.348 --> 00:39:04.619
world was prodigal with its
citizens in battle,

00:39:04.619 --> 00:39:08.687
and it behooved the general,
especially in a democratic

00:39:08.687 --> 00:39:12.829
state, to keep the casualty
lists as low as possible.

00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:17.119
We need to remember that
Athenian generals were not only

00:39:17.119 --> 00:39:21.331
military leaders but also
politicians, who needed to be

00:39:21.331 --> 00:39:24.530
re-elected to their posts every
year.

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:28.794
No doubt Pericles sincerely
took pride in the prudence and

00:39:28.794 --> 00:39:32.766
economy of his leadership,
but it could not have hurt his

00:39:32.766 --> 00:39:36.331
political popularity when he
boasted to the Athenians what

00:39:36.331 --> 00:39:39.895
I've quoted before that as far
as it was in his power they

00:39:39.895 --> 00:39:42.460
would live forever and be
immortals.

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:46.343
Such considerations help
explain his cautious

00:39:46.343 --> 00:39:51.439
performance, and yet there is no
evidence to suggest that he was

00:39:51.439 --> 00:39:55.808
one of those rare military
geniuses who belonged in the

00:39:55.808 --> 00:40:00.340
ranks of Hannibal,
Caesar, Alexander the Great,

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:05.059
a lesser but still worthy
example in our own time,

00:40:05.059 --> 00:40:08.950
George Patton,
who understand the limits of

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:14.138
rational calculation and war and
the need boldly to seize

00:40:14.138 --> 00:40:19.875
opportunity when it offers.
Pericles was what--a term that

00:40:19.875 --> 00:40:25.511
was used in the Second World
War, a soldier's general as the

00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:30.860
PR forces of Omar Bradley
attached that title to him.

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:35.890
He was no George Patton,
or perhaps, even a Bernard

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:41.424
Montgomery, who seeks battle
only when the odds are very

00:40:41.424 --> 00:40:46.417
heavily in his favor.
He lacked the flair and the

00:40:46.417 --> 00:40:50.730
boldness of a Cimon,
the daring and ruthlessness

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:55.921
that seeks victory at any cost.
Another element has been

00:40:55.921 --> 00:40:59.250
suggested to explain the
Periclean strategy.

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:02.210
Pericles himself,
says one critic,

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:05.710
was rather an admiral than a
general.

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:09.564
The Athenian admiralty it was
which framed the strategy out

00:41:09.564 --> 00:41:12.390
the outset of the war,
not Pericles the

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:15.850
burgermeister,
but Pericles the admiral

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:18.849
invented the strategy of
exhaustion,

00:41:18.849 --> 00:41:22.735
a strategy which came near to
ruining Athens in a couple of

00:41:22.735 --> 00:41:25.750
years and could never have won
the victory.

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:28.730
Well, there is some merit in
this analysis;

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:33.265
the Athenians under Pericles
had built a grand strategy that

00:41:33.265 --> 00:41:37.724
was based on naval power that
might seem to suit a maritime

00:41:37.724 --> 00:41:40.598
empire,
whose homeland was an island

00:41:40.598 --> 00:41:44.148
such as Great Britain,
or a power that dominates a

00:41:44.148 --> 00:41:48.640
continent and is separated from
other great powers by two great

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.429
oceans,
like the United States.

00:41:51.429 --> 00:41:55.007
Athens' geographical
situation was not so fortunate,

00:41:55.007 --> 00:41:57.869
for the city was attached to
the mainland,

00:41:57.869 --> 00:42:02.222
offering targets of coercion
not available to the enemies of

00:42:02.222 --> 00:42:06.943
the great Anglo-Saxon countries.
Pericles tried to cancel that

00:42:06.943 --> 00:42:11.369
disadvantage by building the
long walls connecting the city

00:42:11.369 --> 00:42:15.883
to its fortified harbor,
thereby in effect turning the

00:42:15.883 --> 00:42:19.466
city into an island.
It was an extraordinary

00:42:19.466 --> 00:42:24.416
strategy, far ahead of its time,
in its reliance on human reason

00:42:24.416 --> 00:42:29.366
and technology and its rejection
of traditional ways of fighting

00:42:29.366 --> 00:42:33.530
that cost lives and gave the
enemy an advantage.

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:37.362
At the same time,
he abandoned all ideas of

00:42:37.362 --> 00:42:43.110
further expansion and devised a
policy aimed at preserving peace

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:47.490
and the status quo that
perfectly suited Athenian

00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:51.899
interests.
Such a policy depended for

00:42:51.899 --> 00:42:57.684
success on an extraordinary
amount of rationality on

00:42:57.684 --> 00:43:02.248
everyone's part.
The Athenians must be content

00:43:02.248 --> 00:43:07.232
with what they had and abandoned
hopes for extension of their

00:43:07.232 --> 00:43:09.903
power.
There were always the

00:43:09.903 --> 00:43:14.674
Athenians who objected to that,
but while he lived Pericles had

00:43:14.674 --> 00:43:19.290
the wisdom and the political
strength to restrain and control

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:22.657
them.
What he could not control were

00:43:22.657 --> 00:43:26.380
the other states and especially
the enemy.

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:30.651
Unexpected changes and shifts
in power are the normal

00:43:30.651 --> 00:43:33.690
condition of international
history.

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:38.471
These changes have always taken
place, because international

00:43:38.471 --> 00:43:42.929
relations are guided only
partially and spasmodically by

00:43:42.929 --> 00:43:46.820
rational calculations of
material advantage.

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:53.132
Always at work as well are
greed, ambition,

00:43:53.132 --> 00:43:58.392
jealousy, resentment,
anger, hatred,

00:43:58.392 --> 00:44:04.554
and Thucydides' famous triad,
fear, honor,

00:44:04.554 --> 00:44:08.569
and interest.
In the world,

00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:12.404
as it has been,
therefore, a state satisfied

00:44:12.404 --> 00:44:17.933
with its situation and wishing
to preserve peace cannot rely on

00:44:17.933 --> 00:44:22.659
a reason that responds to its
reasoned policies,

00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:27.500
but must anticipate challenges
that seem unreasonable.

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:31.672
The Spartans and their allies
ought to have recognized that

00:44:31.672 --> 00:44:35.484
they had no realistic strategy
to promise victory over

00:44:35.484 --> 00:44:39.585
Pericles' reliance on defense
and refusal to fight a major

00:44:39.585 --> 00:44:43.368
land battle.
But resentment and anger at

00:44:43.368 --> 00:44:48.264
Athenian power and the fear that
it might ultimately undermine

00:44:48.264 --> 00:44:53.000
their own alliance and their
security led them to fight.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.224
As I find it usual in human
history, they were more

00:44:57.224 --> 00:45:02.294
influenced by the memory of the
Athenians' failure to fight a

00:45:02.294 --> 00:45:06.773
traditional battle and
negotiating a peace in 446 than

00:45:06.773 --> 00:45:11.843
by the recognition that the new
technology in the form of the

00:45:11.843 --> 00:45:17.082
long walls made it unnecessary
for Athens to risk such a battle

00:45:17.082 --> 00:45:20.681
in the future.
To deter a war in such

00:45:20.681 --> 00:45:23.537
circumstances,
which is what Pericles was

00:45:23.537 --> 00:45:28.004
trying to do,
requires some offensive threat

00:45:28.004 --> 00:45:33.324
to the Peloponnesians,
whose menace was great and

00:45:33.324 --> 00:45:39.000
impossible to underestimate,
that would make the fear of

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.896
immediate consequences of war
stronger than all the emotions

00:45:43.896 --> 00:45:48.309
leading to war,
but Pericles had come to think

00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:54.049
of Athens as an invulnerable
island since the acquisition of

00:45:54.049 --> 00:45:57.433
a fleet,
a vast treasury to support it,

00:45:57.433 --> 00:46:01.699
and defensible walls.
For such a state to adopt a

00:46:01.699 --> 00:46:06.621
defensive strategy is natural.
It had developed a unique and

00:46:06.621 --> 00:46:10.920
enviable way of fighting that
used these advantages,

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:15.788
and avoided much of the danger
and unpleasantness of ordinary

00:46:15.788 --> 00:46:18.755
warfare.
It allowed the Athenians to

00:46:18.755 --> 00:46:23.705
concentrate their forces quickly
and attack islands and coastal

00:46:23.705 --> 00:46:26.659
enemies before they were
prepared.

00:46:26.659 --> 00:46:30.249
It had permitted them to strike
others without danger to their

00:46:30.249 --> 00:46:33.606
own city and population.
Success in this style of

00:46:33.606 --> 00:46:38.097
warfare made it seem the only
one necessary and defeats with

00:46:38.097 --> 00:46:42.360
great losses on land made the
Athenians reluctant to take

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:46.178
risks by fighting on land.
Offensive action,

00:46:46.178 --> 00:46:49.523
in their view,
should be taken as a last

00:46:49.523 --> 00:46:52.902
resort only;
only when it was absolutely

00:46:52.902 --> 00:46:56.760
unavoidable.
Pericles carried this approach

00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:02.460
to its logical conclusion by
refusing to use a land army even

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:07.614
in defense of the homeland,
much less by using it in

00:47:07.614 --> 00:47:12.989
offensive efforts that might do
the enemy serious harm.

00:47:12.989 --> 00:47:17.909
The enemy's passionate
refusal to see reason made what

00:47:17.909 --> 00:47:22.828
might be called the Athenian way
of warfare inadequate and

00:47:22.828 --> 00:47:28.179
Pericles' strategy a form of
wishful thinking that failed.

00:47:28.179 --> 00:47:33.243
For a state like Athens in 431,
satisfied with the situation,

00:47:33.243 --> 00:47:36.449
capable of keeping the enemy at
bay,

00:47:36.449 --> 00:47:40.747
the temptation to avoid the
risks of offensive action is

00:47:40.747 --> 00:47:44.030
great, but as people often don't
notice,

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:48.148
it contains great dangers.
It tends to create a rigid way

00:47:48.148 --> 00:47:52.358
of thinking that leads men to
apply a previously successful

00:47:52.358 --> 00:47:55.413
strategy,
or one supported by a general

00:47:55.413 --> 00:47:59.480
theory to a situation in which
it is not appropriate.

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:02.349
But it may have other
disadvantages as well;

00:48:02.349 --> 00:48:07.929
its capacity to deter potential
enemies from provoking a war is

00:48:07.929 --> 00:48:11.564
severely limited.
Deterrence by standing behind a

00:48:11.564 --> 00:48:15.227
strong defensive position and
thereby depriving the enemy of

00:48:15.227 --> 00:48:19.786
the chance of victory,
assumes a very high degree of

00:48:19.786 --> 00:48:26.006
rationality and some degree of
imagination on the part of the

00:48:26.006 --> 00:48:29.920
enemy.
Spartans invaded Attica in 431.

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.505
They must have thought they
were risking little,

00:48:32.505 --> 00:48:34.760
even if the Athenians refused
to fight,

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:38.206
even if they persisted in that
refusal for a long time,

00:48:38.206 --> 00:48:41.780
both of which they thought was
unlikely and unnatural.

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:46.243
The Spartans would still be
risking little more than time

00:48:46.243 --> 00:48:48.557
and effort.
In any case,

00:48:48.557 --> 00:48:52.599
their lands and city would be
safe.

00:48:52.599 --> 00:48:57.283
Had the Athenians possessed the
capacity to strike where the

00:48:57.283 --> 00:49:01.808
enemy was vulnerable and had
that capacity been obvious to

00:49:01.808 --> 00:49:04.439
everybody,
Pericles' strategy of

00:49:04.439 --> 00:49:07.190
deterrence might have been
effective.

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:10.732
Once the war came,
there was no way to win without

00:49:10.732 --> 00:49:15.360
abandoning the Athenian way of
war and the Periclean strategy.

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:20.977
As Pericles lay dying in the
fall of 429, his strategy was a

00:49:20.977 --> 00:49:23.725
failure.
After three campaigning

00:49:23.725 --> 00:49:28.332
seasons, the Peloponnesians
showed no signs of exhaustion of

00:49:28.332 --> 00:49:30.475
any kind.
On the contrary,

00:49:30.475 --> 00:49:34.845
they had just lately refused an
Athenian offer of peace and

00:49:34.845 --> 00:49:39.140
fought on with the determination
to destroy Athenian power

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:41.053
forever.
The Athenians,

00:49:41.053 --> 00:49:44.254
on the other hand,
had seen their lands and homes

00:49:44.254 --> 00:49:47.589
ravaged repeatedly,
their crops and trees burnt and

00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:50.449
destroyed.
They were also suffering from

00:49:50.449 --> 00:49:53.848
the plague which was killing
great numbers of them and

00:49:53.848 --> 00:49:57.913
destroying their moral fiber.
In the anecdote that I

00:49:57.913 --> 00:50:02.173
quoted at the beginning of this
talk, Plutarch speaks of

00:50:02.173 --> 00:50:06.820
Pericles' response to the praise
of his military prowess,

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:09.909
you'll remember.
He expressed astonishment--you

00:50:09.909 --> 00:50:12.543
know they thought he was
sleeping, it turned out he

00:50:12.543 --> 00:50:14.676
wasn't.
He was hearing what they were

00:50:14.676 --> 00:50:17.110
saying.
He expressed astonishment that

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:21.158
they should be praising what was
the result of good fortune as

00:50:21.158 --> 00:50:24.705
much as his own talents,
and what many others had

00:50:24.705 --> 00:50:27.546
accomplished.
Instead, he said,

00:50:27.546 --> 00:50:33.851
they should be praising the
finest and the most important of

00:50:33.851 --> 00:50:40.583
his claims to greatness -- that
no Athenian now alive has put on

00:50:40.583 --> 00:50:45.796
mourning clothes because of me.
That assertion,

00:50:45.796 --> 00:50:49.530
the last words of Pericles
reported to us,

00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:52.809
must have astounded his
audience,

00:50:52.809 --> 00:50:57.219
even his friends would have had
to admit that his policy had

00:50:57.219 --> 00:51:01.637
contributed, at least something,
to the coming of the war and

00:51:01.637 --> 00:51:05.795
that his strategy had something
to do with the intensity of the

00:51:05.795 --> 00:51:08.210
destruction caused by the
plague.

00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:14.154
His final words show deeply
how he felt the wounds caused by

00:51:14.154 --> 00:51:19.061
the widespread accusations
hurled against him and his

00:51:19.061 --> 00:51:25.099
stubborn refusal to admit that
he had been wrong in any way.

00:51:25.099 --> 00:51:28.884
He had applied his great
intelligence to his city's

00:51:28.884 --> 00:51:33.501
needs, and reason told him that
he was not responsible for the

00:51:33.501 --> 00:51:36.305
results,
which he must have believed to

00:51:36.305 --> 00:51:39.343
be temporary.
He must have thought in time

00:51:39.343 --> 00:51:42.190
his expectations would be
fulfilled.

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:46.502
If his fellow citizens would
have the wisdom and courage to

00:51:46.502 --> 00:51:49.699
hold to his strategy,
they would win out.

00:51:49.699 --> 00:51:55.550
So he believed and so did his
contemporary Thucydides.

00:51:55.550 --> 00:52:00.020
More than two millennia
later, Clausewitz saw war

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:03.903
through very different eyes.
I quote him,

00:52:03.903 --> 00:52:09.767
"War is more than a true
chameleon that slightly shapes

00:52:09.767 --> 00:52:14.219
its characteristics to the given
case.

00:52:14.219 --> 00:52:19.522
As a total phenomenon,
its dominant tendencies always

00:52:19.522 --> 00:52:26.150
make war a paradoxical trinity
composed of primordial violence,

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:31.855
hatred, and enmity,
which are to be regarded as a

00:52:31.855 --> 00:52:36.614
blind natural force.
Of the play of chance and

00:52:36.614 --> 00:52:41.762
probability, within which the
creative spirit is free to roam

00:52:41.762 --> 00:52:45.966
and its elements of
subordination as an instrument

00:52:45.966 --> 00:52:50.599
of policy which makes it subject
to reason alone.

00:52:50.599 --> 00:52:55.304
These three tendencies are like
three different codes of law,

00:52:55.304 --> 00:52:59.460
deep rooted in their subject
and yet variable in their

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:04.374
relationship to one another.
A theory that ignores any one

00:53:04.374 --> 00:53:09.100
of them, or seeks to fix an
arbitrary relationship between

00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:14.323
them would conflict with reality
to such an extent that for this

00:53:14.323 --> 00:53:18.219
reason alone it would be totally
useless."

00:53:18.219 --> 00:53:23.592
Like most generals in
history, and unlike its few

00:53:23.592 --> 00:53:28.654
military geniuses,
Pericles saw war as essentially

00:53:28.654 --> 00:53:33.688
a linear phenomenon subject,
as Clausewitz said,

00:53:33.688 --> 00:53:37.872
to reason alone and too little,
in my judgment,

00:53:37.872 --> 00:53:41.420
did he understand its other
aspects;

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:46.639
for that he and his people paid
a very great price.

00:53:46.639 --> 00:53:50.355
Okay, well, we do have some
time and I'd be very glad to

00:53:50.355 --> 00:53:54.679
hear any questions or comments
that any of you'd like to make.

00:53:54.679 --> 00:53:57.618
After all we only have a
twenty-seven year war and we've

00:53:57.618 --> 00:54:00.290
got twenty minutes to talk about
it, no problem.

00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:06.462
Anybody have anything to say?
Yes?Student:

00:54:06.462 --> 00:54:11.283
[inaudible]Professor
Donald Kagan: That's a

00:54:11.283 --> 00:54:16.560
fairly long story but I think
the best answer I can give is

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:22.200
the one I gave last time when I
spoke about Thucydides' reasons

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:25.929
for writing the story that he
did.

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:30.988
He had been a supporter of
Pericles and things hadn't

00:54:30.988 --> 00:54:34.704
worked out well.
The state had gone a direction

00:54:34.704 --> 00:54:38.896
very different from the one that
he favored, including a strategy

00:54:38.896 --> 00:54:41.320
that was the opposite of
Pericles.

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:45.650
The average guy in the street,
who was a guy that he didn't

00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:48.412
approve of very much,
thought wrongly,

00:54:48.412 --> 00:54:51.324
he believed,
that Pericles had been dead

00:54:51.324 --> 00:54:53.490
wrong.
It was Pericles' fault they

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:56.079
went to war, it was Pericles'
fault they lost the war,

00:54:56.079 --> 00:54:58.955
and Thucydides associated
himself, I think,

00:54:58.955 --> 00:55:01.900
with Pericles and his approach
to things,

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:04.984
and so he had to make the case,
that he believed the case that

00:55:04.984 --> 00:55:07.020
he made.
I mean, it's very important

00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:08.683
to realize that.
And Plutarch,

00:55:08.683 --> 00:55:11.408
coming many centuries later,
like everybody,

00:55:11.408 --> 00:55:14.639
who has ever spoken about the
Peloponnesian War,

00:55:14.639 --> 00:55:19.038
once Thucydides had written,
was powerfully influenced by

00:55:19.038 --> 00:55:21.627
Thucydides.
I think just about everybody

00:55:21.627 --> 00:55:25.041
who has ever considered the war
has come away pretty much with

00:55:25.041 --> 00:55:27.280
Thucydides' judgment of these
things.

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.510
So, I think that's the answer
to that.

00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:42.621
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:55:42.621 --> 00:55:51.387
Donald Kagan: The question
is, "can I think of any modern

00:55:51.387 --> 00:55:59.570
generals who did use Pericles'
approach as a model."

00:55:59.570 --> 00:56:04.032
I think the answer is not
anybody--well yeah,

00:56:04.032 --> 00:56:10.219
General McClellan in the Civil
War and it was a very analogous

00:56:10.219 --> 00:56:14.725
situation.
McClellan did not want to fight

00:56:14.725 --> 00:56:17.705
Lee's army.
He wasn't all that crazy about

00:56:17.705 --> 00:56:20.800
the anti-slavery stuff anyway,
but apart from that,

00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:24.506
he didn't want to pay the
price, which was a tremendous

00:56:24.506 --> 00:56:28.898
price fighting the Civil War and
so he wanted to avoid battle and

00:56:28.898 --> 00:56:32.330
pretty much Lincoln couldn't get
him to fight.

00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:39.062
So, that's one example.
Now, the next thing I would

00:56:39.062 --> 00:56:43.363
offer you as something to chew
on at least--it is not

00:56:43.363 --> 00:56:49.214
identical, it's only similar.
I think the strategy

00:56:49.214 --> 00:56:56.159
undertaken by the Secretary of
Defense in the current

00:56:56.159 --> 00:57:04.171
administration in launching the
attacks on Afghanistan and on

00:57:04.171 --> 00:57:10.340
Persia--I mean Iraq.
I got Greeks on my mind;

00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:17.110
I have to fight Persians.
Iraq reflected an aspect of it.

00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:21.157
They were both,
for reasons I don't have to

00:57:21.157 --> 00:57:25.204
explain to you,
desperately eager to reduce

00:57:25.204 --> 00:57:31.372
casualties to a minimum and they
were desperately eager to choose

00:57:31.372 --> 00:57:37.539
an approach that would limit the
time that the war lasted,

00:57:37.539 --> 00:57:42.800
because of the political
situation in the last decades in

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:48.623
American history and they had an
advantage technologically that

00:57:48.623 --> 00:57:53.132
seemed to make that
possible--America's fantastic

00:57:53.132 --> 00:57:58.426
advantage in fire power,
the capacity to deliver the

00:57:58.426 --> 00:58:03.195
fire power at a distance with
very little risk to the

00:58:03.195 --> 00:58:06.151
deliverers,
with the notion of doing

00:58:06.151 --> 00:58:10.121
tremendous harm when it got
there, but I don't know if any

00:58:10.121 --> 00:58:13.309
of you remember any of this,
some of you were too young to

00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:15.921
even think about it I guess.
Originally, remember--what was

00:58:15.921 --> 00:58:18.926
that phrase that they had,
what was that great strategy we

00:58:18.926 --> 00:58:22.090
were going to use by bombing the
hell out of the Iraqi's?

00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:24.300
Shock and awe;
it was the same thing.

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:28.199
Shock and awe was meant to say
oh my God this is going to

00:58:28.199 --> 00:58:31.960
happen to us and we quit,
was what they had in mind.

00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:36.990
They deliberately chose not
to have ground forces that would

00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:41.701
have been capable of doing the
kinds of things that it turns

00:58:41.701 --> 00:58:45.933
out you need to do to be
successful in these wars just

00:58:45.933 --> 00:58:49.847
like other wars.
So, when it happened that it

00:58:49.847 --> 00:58:54.163
was clear things were not
working out, according to their

00:58:54.163 --> 00:58:56.890
plan,
they stubbornly clung to that

00:58:56.890 --> 00:59:01.329
plan, even as the evidence was
that it wasn't going to work.

00:59:01.329 --> 00:59:04.260
So, that would be a candidate I
suggest.

00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:17.868
Yes?Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:59:17.868 --> 00:59:29.300
Donald Kagan: Yeah,
the question is,

00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:32.098
"do I think that recent
Athenian history or the

00:59:32.098 --> 00:59:34.896
structure--you mean the
democratic society--the

00:59:34.896 --> 00:59:38.850
democracy had anything to do
with the adoption of this plan?"

00:59:38.850 --> 00:59:41.800
Perhaps.
You're absolutely right;

00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:46.338
there must have been a very
clear and painful memory of what

00:59:46.338 --> 00:59:50.030
happened to Tolmides,
when he invaded Boeotia.

00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:52.417
There were very,
very heavy casualties there for

00:59:52.417 --> 00:59:54.326
the Athenians.
That's the only one in which

00:59:54.326 --> 00:59:56.167
they did have a lot,
but they did have those and

00:59:56.167 --> 00:59:58.983
they were unusual.
So, it may have persuaded

00:59:58.983 --> 01:00:03.129
Pericles that the Athenian
people would find it hard,

01:00:03.129 --> 01:00:06.079
but on balance I really think
not.

01:00:06.079 --> 01:00:09.843
I don't think that the Athenian
democracy was very different

01:00:09.843 --> 01:00:13.416
from the oligarchies of the
other Greek cities in the way

01:00:13.416 --> 01:00:17.391
they thought about things.
They would have much preferred

01:00:17.391 --> 01:00:19.857
to fight it out.
It was only Pericles'

01:00:19.857 --> 01:00:23.379
incredible command of the
political situation that allowed

01:00:23.379 --> 01:00:26.159
him to take the strategy that
people said,

01:00:26.159 --> 01:00:27.840
what in the world is this guy
doing?

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.559
They turned against it very
swiftly.

01:00:31.559 --> 01:00:34.010
So, no I don't think that
democracy was especially

01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:36.352
important.
Now, the enemies of Pericles

01:00:36.352 --> 01:00:40.023
and the enemies of democracy--I
shouldn't say the enemies of

01:00:40.023 --> 01:00:42.786
Pericles,
I mean the ancient enemies of

01:00:42.786 --> 01:00:46.888
democracy do say that it was the
Athenian democracy's way of

01:00:46.888 --> 01:00:50.365
running the war,
which guaranteed disaster and

01:00:50.365 --> 01:00:54.380
they fix on something that comes
later down the road,

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:58.412
the Sicilian Expedition,
which was a dangerous

01:00:58.412 --> 01:01:02.900
undertaking as it turned out,
although the Athenians didn't

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:05.969
think so at the time,
and they think only a democracy

01:01:05.969 --> 01:01:09.449
could have done anything as
stupid as that.They are,

01:01:09.449 --> 01:01:11.749
in that way,
following precisely what

01:01:11.749 --> 01:01:14.687
Thucydides says,
but if you read my account you

01:01:14.687 --> 01:01:18.199
will see that there's another
way of looking at it,

01:01:18.199 --> 01:01:22.630
but that's what the ancient
anti-democratic view was.

01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:25.164
Democracies are idiots;
they don't know how to conduct

01:01:25.164 --> 01:01:27.969
war or do anything else right.
They will bring disaster.

01:01:27.969 --> 01:01:31.369
I think you can get disaster a
lot of ways.

01:01:31.369 --> 01:01:38.127
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

01:01:38.127 --> 01:01:46.500
Donald Kagan: It's very
clear that so long as Pericles

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:55.019
was in charge everybody did what
Pericles wanted done.

01:01:55.019 --> 01:01:58.786
Part of the reason was that we
know pretty well,

01:01:58.786 --> 01:02:03.193
from the evidence that at least
a good number of the ten

01:02:03.193 --> 01:02:07.360
generals in any one year were
close to Pericles,

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:11.539
so that his political influence
spread.

01:02:11.539 --> 01:02:14.862
Very unusual thing in the
ancient world for anybody in

01:02:14.862 --> 01:02:18.560
ancient Athens for anybody to
have that kind of a carry-over

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.434
effect,
but we see there's always

01:02:20.434 --> 01:02:23.039
several generals that we know
are friends of Pericles,

01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:26.730
and I think the rest of the
story is that you see the

01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:31.130
generals don't get to decide
what they do in ancient Athens.

01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:32.869
This is the part that blows
your mind.

01:02:32.869 --> 01:02:37.484
When you send an army out,
that army gets a general or

01:02:37.484 --> 01:02:42.180
more, it gets an assigned amount
of money and equipment and

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:45.304
stuff,
and it gets orders and all of

01:02:45.304 --> 01:02:50.013
those things are decided by the
assembly after a debate by a

01:02:50.013 --> 01:02:53.452
majority vote.
And what I would suggest to you

01:02:53.452 --> 01:02:57.079
is that Pericles did not lose
any of those arguments,

01:02:57.079 --> 01:02:59.972
except in the one case when
they came after him and nailed

01:02:59.972 --> 01:03:02.510
him, and then they put him back
in office again.

01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:05.460
So, does that take care of your
question?

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:12.614
Student:
[inaudible]

01:03:12.614 --> 01:03:27.400
Professor Donald Kagan:
The heart of the question is,

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:31.018
"was Pericles wise to adopt a
strategy no matter how good a

01:03:31.018 --> 01:03:34.529
strategy it might have been,
which he knew the Athenians

01:03:34.529 --> 01:03:37.080
didn't like," and I think the
answer--well,

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.858
the outcome is obvious.
No, he wasn't wise,

01:03:39.858 --> 01:03:43.329
but that's I think more because
the strategy was faulty,

01:03:43.329 --> 01:03:46.610
not so much because the
Athenians didn't like it.

01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:50.313
He had proven over the years,
and he proved now in the most

01:03:50.313 --> 01:03:52.966
delicate of times,
that essentially he could get

01:03:52.966 --> 01:03:54.866
the Athenians to do what he
wanted to do,

01:03:54.866 --> 01:03:57.430
whether in fact they liked it
to begin with or not;

01:03:57.430 --> 01:04:01.232
he persuaded them to do it.
So, I don't think that was

01:04:01.232 --> 01:04:04.090
really a flaw.
The problem was that things

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:08.107
went wrong almost immediately
and then such terrible things

01:04:08.107 --> 01:04:11.710
were happening as did shake his
power for awhile,

01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:15.855
but even then he came back into
power and still his strategy

01:04:15.855 --> 01:04:18.150
wasn't working.
I think the problem,

01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:21.449
therefore--I think you could
say he knew what he was doing.

01:04:21.449 --> 01:04:24.531
He thought he could get away
with it and he could have if the

01:04:24.531 --> 01:04:25.970
strategy had been correct.

01:04:29.289 --> 01:04:39.998
Yes?Student:
[inaudible]Professor

01:04:39.998 --> 01:04:51.348
Donald Kagan: Oh yes,
yes, the question is ancient

01:04:51.348 --> 01:05:03.769
writers--Plutarch is whom you're
really talking about.

01:05:03.769 --> 01:05:08.116
They give Pericles credit for
being a great general,

01:05:08.116 --> 01:05:11.440
but they say bad things about
Nicias,

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:16.484
who was involved in the great
defeat in Sicily and yet,

01:05:16.484 --> 01:05:21.809
Nicias pursued something like
the strategy of Pericles,

01:05:21.809 --> 01:05:24.329
which was avoiding these
conflicts.

01:05:24.329 --> 01:05:29.999
I think the first thing I want
to point out is that Thucydides

01:05:29.999 --> 01:05:33.728
didn't do that.
Not only does Thucydides

01:05:33.728 --> 01:05:38.741
thoroughly support the strategy
of Pericles, he writes an

01:05:38.741 --> 01:05:44.292
encomium on the death of Nicias
that raises him to the level of

01:05:44.292 --> 01:05:48.409
Pericles or higher in his own
estimation.

01:05:48.409 --> 01:05:51.837
But in the case of Nicias it
was, in a way,

01:05:51.837 --> 01:05:56.000
even worse than what Pericles
did because Nicias,

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.250
first of all,
was against the war,

01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:01.320
against going to Sicily in the
first place,

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:05.183
then when he was chosen to be
general he went,

01:06:05.183 --> 01:06:09.303
but before he did that,
he tried to convince that

01:06:09.303 --> 01:06:12.480
having lost the vote shall we
go.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:16.096
He then decided to trick
the Athenians into not going

01:06:16.096 --> 01:06:19.909
anyway by saying to them,
oh well, if you're going to go

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:23.634
all right, but it'll be
perfectly safe if you just sort

01:06:23.634 --> 01:06:27.842
of take this--the original fleet
was going to have sixty ships

01:06:27.842 --> 01:06:31.024
period.
Well, they ended up having a

01:06:31.024 --> 01:06:35.649
130 ships, 5000 hoplites,
raising the risk of that thing

01:06:35.649 --> 01:06:40.862
to the level that finally made
it seem like they could lose the

01:06:40.862 --> 01:06:44.309
war by losing the Sicilian
campaign,

01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:47.596
and he didn't--the Athenians,
instead of saying what he

01:06:47.596 --> 01:06:50.273
expected, oh no,
no if that's what we have to

01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:51.412
do,
let's not go,

01:06:51.412 --> 01:06:53.822
Instead they said,
right on, yes you can have

01:06:53.822 --> 01:06:57.250
everything you ask for Nicias,
what would you like,

01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:59.726
and off they went.
Thereafter,

01:06:59.726 --> 01:07:03.033
his performance on that
expedition is one of somebody,

01:07:03.033 --> 01:07:06.590
who doesn't really want to
carry out his instructions.

01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:11.389
What he would have liked to do
was, having lost the argument

01:07:11.389 --> 01:07:16.107
twice now--he went out and did
everything he could to avoid

01:07:16.107 --> 01:07:20.663
confronting any battle in
Syracuse and was finally driven

01:07:20.663 --> 01:07:24.987
to fight at Syracuse,
very much against his will and

01:07:24.987 --> 01:07:29.243
then I could go back and read
it, but he screws up the detail

01:07:29.243 --> 01:07:34.523
of it over and over again,
and so I think there are good

01:07:34.523 --> 01:07:40.079
grounds for condemning him as a
general, whereas,

01:07:40.079 --> 01:07:44.967
the grounds on which Pericles
should be criticized,

01:07:44.967 --> 01:07:50.540
I think, is as a strategist
rather than as a commander.

01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:54.602
Anybody else?
Yeah?Student:

01:07:54.602 --> 01:07:59.671
[inaudible]
Professor Donald Kagan:

01:07:59.671 --> 01:08:04.875
No, but I think they--well,
I'll make one little exception

01:08:04.875 --> 01:08:08.588
to that, but I think they could
have had a very good chance to

01:08:08.588 --> 01:08:12.239
come out of the war in the way
Pericles hoped they would.

01:08:12.239 --> 01:08:17.015
If they had pursued the limited
aggressive program that was

01:08:17.015 --> 01:08:21.380
undertaken by Cleon and
Demosthenes after the death of

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:23.760
Pericles--so,
taking Pylos,

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.775
building a fort at Pylos,
taking Cythera,

01:08:26.775 --> 01:08:30.644
building a fort there,
and perhaps even a few other

01:08:30.644 --> 01:08:34.614
places on the periphery of the
Peloponnesus and launching

01:08:34.614 --> 01:08:38.803
attacks from those places,
but not staying to fight the

01:08:38.803 --> 01:08:43.300
Spartans at any great battle,
just causing that to happen.

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:47.238
If they had been able to do
that for a stretch of time,

01:08:47.238 --> 01:08:51.541
then the hope that Cleon had
that the helots might escape to

01:08:51.541 --> 01:08:56.210
these forts and ultimately bring
about an internal upheaval,

01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:59.348
which the Spartans panicked
might happen,

01:08:59.348 --> 01:09:02.880
would have led the Spartans to
offer peace,

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:05.340
and in fact they do.
The Spartans offer peace.

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:08.958
You could argue that if the
Athenians had simply accepted

01:09:08.958 --> 01:09:12.965
the Spartan peace offer in 425
the war would have been over and

01:09:12.965 --> 01:09:16.454
the Athenian Empire would have
been intact just the way

01:09:16.454 --> 01:09:19.423
Pericles wanted it.
So, not only could they have

01:09:19.423 --> 01:09:22.179
done it--and they would have
done it, if they had accepted

01:09:22.179 --> 01:09:23.914
it.
They wouldn't accept victory

01:09:23.914 --> 01:09:26.029
you could argue,
as many a scholar does.

01:09:26.029 --> 01:09:29.655
The only other point I want to
make is after that didn't

01:09:29.655 --> 01:09:33.413
happen, and finally a peace was
drawn up and signed and in

01:09:33.413 --> 01:09:36.085
effect in 421,
which is another evidence that

01:09:36.085 --> 01:09:38.909
they could achieve what they
wanted by the techniques that

01:09:38.909 --> 01:09:42.002
were put forward,
but after that happened that

01:09:42.002 --> 01:09:46.432
peace broke down and now the
Athenians found themselves part

01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:50.752
of a new alliance of states,
Athenians with three

01:09:50.752 --> 01:09:56.828
Peloponnesian democracies who
produce a big land battle in the

01:09:56.828 --> 01:10:01.510
Peloponnesus and the Athenians
come--I mean,

01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:05.371
the enemies of Sparta come that
close to defeating the Spartan

01:10:05.371 --> 01:10:08.318
army in the Peloponnesus.
Had they done that,

01:10:08.318 --> 01:10:11.601
they would have finished Sparta
off as a dominant power of the

01:10:11.601 --> 01:10:12.991
Greeks.
So the answer is,

01:10:12.991 --> 01:10:15.946
they actually had it in their
hands a couple of times and on

01:10:15.946 --> 01:10:18.199
another time they missed by
about an inch.

01:10:18.199 --> 01:10:20.020
Yeah they could have won that
way.

01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:22.926
I think we're out of time.
Let me wish you all a very

01:10:22.926 --> 01:10:25.000
happy holiday.
Bye-bye.

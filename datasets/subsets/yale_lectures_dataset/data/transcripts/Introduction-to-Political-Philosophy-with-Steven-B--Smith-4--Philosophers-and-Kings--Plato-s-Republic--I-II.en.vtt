00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.014
Professor Steven Smith:
There is one person in here,

00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:11.627
I don't know who it is,
and you will not know who it is

00:00:11.627 --> 00:00:16.668
yet, but there is one person in
here for whom the reading of

00:00:16.668 --> 00:00:21.964
Plato's Republic will be
the most important intellectual

00:00:21.964 --> 00:00:25.040
experience you have at Yale.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.345
It is a book that one of you
will go back to time and time

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:37.310
again and it will stick with you
forever.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.906
What I would like you to do is
to remember this and four years

00:00:41.906 --> 00:00:45.750
from now, when most of you are
ready to graduate,

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.713
if that one person in here
would email me and let me know

00:00:51.713 --> 00:00:53.630
who it is, okay?

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.790
Maybe it will be you.
Maybe?

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.750
Possibly.
Or you.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.122
Okay.
This is the book that started

00:01:07.122 --> 00:01:09.413
it all.
The Apology,

00:01:09.413 --> 00:01:13.368
the Crito,
these are warm-ups to the big

00:01:13.368 --> 00:01:17.409
theme, to the big book,
the Republic.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.153
Every other book in this
political science that has since

00:01:22.153 --> 00:01:25.456
been written,
beginning with Aristotle's

00:01:25.456 --> 00:01:30.200
Politics and moving on to
the present day is,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.688
in one way or another,
an answer, a response to

00:01:35.688 --> 00:01:42.440
Plato's Republic.
It started the whole thing.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.031
The first and most obvious
thing to say about the

00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:51.239
Republic is that it is a
long book.

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:55.849
Not the longest book you will
ever read, but long enough.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.791
In fact, in part,
because of this,

00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:02.980
we are only reading
approximately half the book,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.079
the first five books,
to be more specific.

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:13.176
The first five books that deal
with and culminate in the best

00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:17.843
city, Plato's ideal city,
what he calls Kallipolis,

00:02:17.843 --> 00:02:20.382
the just city,
the beautiful city,

00:02:20.382 --> 00:02:25.083
ruled by philosopher-kings.
The second half of the book

00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:29.958
turns in somewhat different,
certainly equally important

00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:33.090
directions,
but would take us much more

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.590
time than the time we have
allotted to deal with.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.400
So you will read that on your
own.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.080
You can take another course,
what have you.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.860
The Republic is a very
perplexing book,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.361
you will find out.
Its meaning will not be evident

00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:57.368
to you on a first reading.
It may not be clear to you on a

00:02:57.368 --> 00:03:01.256
tenth reading,
unless you approach it with the

00:03:01.256 --> 00:03:05.490
proper questions and the proper
frame of mind.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.710
So let's start by asking a
simple question.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.220
What is the Republic
about?

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.220
What does this book deal with?

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.422
This is a question that has
perplexed and divided readers of

00:03:23.422 --> 00:03:29.824
Plato almost from the beginning.
Is it a book about justice,

00:03:29.824 --> 00:03:34.460
as the subtitle of the book
suggests?

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.612
Is it a book about what we
today might call moral

00:03:39.612 --> 00:03:45.410
psychology and the right
ordering of the human soul,

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.620
which is a prominent theme
addressed in this work?

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.595
Is it a book about the power of
poetry and myth,

00:03:55.595 --> 00:04:01.948
what we would call the whole
domain of culture to shape souls

00:04:01.948 --> 00:04:07.437
and to shape our societies?
Or is it a book about

00:04:07.437 --> 00:04:12.377
metaphysics and the ultimate
structure of being,

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:18.473
as certainly many of the later
books of the Republic

00:04:18.473 --> 00:04:21.462
suggest?
The theory of the forms,

00:04:21.462 --> 00:04:24.910
the image of the divided line
and so on and so on.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.029
Of course, it is about all of
these things and several others

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:34.230
as well.
But at least at the beginning,

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.300
when we approach the book,
we should stay on its surface,

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.279
not dig at least initially too
deeply.

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:46.831
As one of the great readers of
Plato of the last century once

00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:51.919
said, "Only the surface of
things reveals the essence of

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.500
things."
The surface of the

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.340
Republic reveals that it
is a dialogue.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:05.009
It is a conversation.
We should approach the book,

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.924
in other words,
not as we might a treatise,

00:05:08.924 --> 00:05:14.329
but as we might approach a work
of literature or drama.

00:05:14.329 --> 00:05:20.394
It is a work comparable in
scope to other literary

00:05:20.394 --> 00:05:24.725
masterworks--Hamlet,
Don Quixote,

00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:30.790
War and Peace,
others you might think of.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.023
As a conversation,
as a dialogue,

00:05:34.023 --> 00:05:38.368
it is something the author
wants us to join,

00:05:38.368 --> 00:05:43.062
to take part in.
We are invited to be not merely

00:05:43.062 --> 00:05:46.337
passive onlookers of this
conversation,

00:05:46.337 --> 00:05:51.423
but active participants in that
dialogue that takes place in

00:05:51.423 --> 00:05:55.820
this book over the course of a
single evening.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.882
Perhaps the best way to read
this book is to read it aloud,

00:06:05.882 --> 00:06:09.872
as you might with a play,
to yourself or with your

00:06:09.872 --> 00:06:10.850
friends.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.302
Let's go a little further.
The Republic is also a

00:06:19.302 --> 00:06:25.064
utopia, a word that Plato does
not use, was not coined until

00:06:25.064 --> 00:06:29.850
many, many centuries later by
Sir Thomas More.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:36.240
But Plato's book is a utopia.
It is a kind of extreme.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.800
He presents an extreme vision
of politics.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.800
He presents an extreme vision
of the polis.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.658
The guiding thread of the book
is the correspondence,

00:06:45.658 --> 00:06:50.036
and we will look at this in
some length and you will discuss

00:06:50.036 --> 00:06:52.560
it in your sections,
no doubt.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.804
The guiding thread of the book
is the correspondence,

00:06:56.804 --> 00:07:01.865
the symmetry between the parts
of the city and the parts of the

00:07:01.865 --> 00:07:04.717
soul.
Discord within the city,

00:07:04.717 --> 00:07:09.129
just as discord within the
soul, is regarded as the

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:13.188
greatest evil.
The aim of the Republic

00:07:13.188 --> 00:07:18.135
is to establish a harmonious
city, based on a conception of

00:07:18.135 --> 00:07:20.618
justice that,
so to speak,

00:07:20.618 --> 00:07:26.209
harmonizes the individual and
society, how to achieve that.

00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:31.823
The best city would necessarily
be one that seeks to produce the

00:07:31.823 --> 00:07:35.120
best or highest type of
individual.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.256
Plato's famous answer to this
is that this city--any

00:07:39.256 --> 00:07:42.420
city--will never be free of
conflict,

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.045
will never be free of factional
strife until,

00:07:46.045 --> 00:07:50.247
in his famous formula,
kings become philosophers and

00:07:50.247 --> 00:07:52.720
philosophers become kings.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.403
The Republic asks us to
consider seriously,

00:08:04.403 --> 00:08:08.950
what would a city look like
ruled by philosophers?

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.361
In this respect,
it would seem to be the sort of

00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:18.120
perfect bookend to the
Apology.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.281
Remember, the Apology
viewed the dangers posed to

00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:26.896
philosophy and the philosopher
and the philosophical life from

00:08:26.896 --> 00:08:30.478
the city.
The Republic asks us,

00:08:30.478 --> 00:08:35.674
what would a city be like if it
were ruled by Socrates or

00:08:35.674 --> 00:08:38.615
someone like him?
What would it be like for

00:08:38.615 --> 00:08:41.322
philosophers to rule?
Such a city would require,

00:08:41.322 --> 00:08:44.759
so Socrates tells us throughout
the opening books,

00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:49.396
the severe censorship of poetry
and theology,

00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:54.769
the abolition of private
property and the family,

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:58.260
at least among the guardian
class of the city,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.440
and the use of selected lies
and myths,

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.460
what would today probably be
called ideology or propaganda,

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:12.016
as tools of political rule.
It would seem that far from

00:09:12.016 --> 00:09:18.447
utopia, the Republic
represents a radical dystopia,

00:09:18.447 --> 00:09:23.750
a satire, in some sense,
of the best polity.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:29.470
In fact, much of modern
political science is directed

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.640
against Plato's legacy.
The modern state,

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:38.739
as we have come to understand
it, is based upon the separation

00:09:38.739 --> 00:09:42.500
of civil society from governing
authority.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:47.633
The entire domain of what we
call private life separated from

00:09:47.633 --> 00:09:51.320
the state.
But Plato's Republic

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:57.036
recognizes no such separation or
no such independence for a

00:09:57.036 --> 00:10:00.338
private sphere.
For this reason,

00:10:00.338 --> 00:10:06.167
Plato has often been cast as a
kind of harbinger of the modern

00:10:06.167 --> 00:10:08.270
totalitarian state.

00:10:11.289 --> 00:10:16.535
A famous professor at a distant
university was said to have

00:10:16.535 --> 00:10:21.419
begun his lectures on the
Republic by saying,

00:10:21.419 --> 00:10:23.580
"Now we will consider Plato,
the fascist."

00:10:27.029 --> 00:10:30.398
This was, in fact,
the view popularized by one of

00:10:30.398 --> 00:10:34.397
the most influential books about
Plato written in the last

00:10:34.397 --> 00:10:37.947
century,
a book written by a Viennese

00:10:37.947 --> 00:10:43.459
émigré by the name of Karl
Popper, who in the very early

00:10:43.459 --> 00:10:46.568
1950s,
right at the height of the Cold

00:10:46.568 --> 00:10:51.044
War and of course the end of the
conclusion of the Second World

00:10:51.044 --> 00:10:53.683
War,
wrote a book called The Open

00:10:53.683 --> 00:10:58.544
Society and Its Enemies.
He wanted to know what were the

00:10:58.544 --> 00:11:03.256
causes or who was responsible
for the experiences of

00:11:03.256 --> 00:11:07.507
totalitarianism,
both in Stalin's Russia and in

00:11:07.507 --> 00:11:11.798
Hitler's Germany.
In the course of this inquiry,

00:11:11.798 --> 00:11:16.166
he concluded that not only
Hegel and Marx were important in

00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:21.120
that particular genealogy,
but this went back to Plato as

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:26.831
well, Plato principally.
Plato, who Popper accuses in a

00:11:26.831 --> 00:11:32.159
passionate, albeit not very well
written book,

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:37.625
accuses Plato of being the
first to establish a kind of

00:11:37.625 --> 00:11:42.929
totalitarian dictatorship.
Is that true?

00:11:42.929 --> 00:11:49.138
Plato's Republic is,
we will discover as you read,

00:11:49.138 --> 00:11:53.129
a republic of a very special
kind.

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:59.087
It is not a regime like ours
devoted to maximizing individual

00:11:59.087 --> 00:12:04.449
liberties, but it is one that
puts the education of its

00:12:04.449 --> 00:12:08.071
citizens,
the education of its members,

00:12:08.071 --> 00:12:09.760
as its highest duty.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:18.147
The Republic,
like the Greek polis,

00:12:18.147 --> 00:12:21.730
was a kind of tutelary
association.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:25.422
Its principal good,
its principal goal,

00:12:25.422 --> 00:12:30.474
was the education of citizens
for positions of public

00:12:30.474 --> 00:12:35.430
leadership and high political
responsibilities.

00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:44.084
It is always worthwhile to
remember that Plato was,

00:12:44.084 --> 00:12:49.730
above all, a teacher.
He was the founder of the first

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:54.429
university, the Academy,
the Platonic Academy,

00:12:54.429 --> 00:12:58.141
where we will find out later
Aristotle came to study,

00:12:58.141 --> 00:13:02.210
among many others--Aristotle
being but the most famous.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.590
Plato was the founder of this
school.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:08.299
This, in turn,
spawned other philosophical

00:13:08.299 --> 00:13:12.280
schools throughout the Greek
world and later,

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.209
the Roman world.
With the demise of Rome,

00:13:16.209 --> 00:13:20.801
in the early Christian
centuries, these philosophical

00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:23.979
academies,
these philosophical schools,

00:13:23.979 --> 00:13:27.240
were absorbed into the medieval
monasteries.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.092
These, in turn,
became the basis of the first

00:13:32.092 --> 00:13:36.944
European universities in places
like Bologna,

00:13:36.944 --> 00:13:41.038
Paris, Oxford.
These were, in turn,

00:13:41.038 --> 00:13:47.260
later transplanted to the New
World and established in towns

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.899
like Cambridge and,
of course, New Haven.

00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:57.821
We can say today that this
university is a direct ancestor

00:13:57.821 --> 00:14:02.600
of the platonic republic of
Plato's Academy.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:06.410
We are all here the heirs of
Plato.

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:11.590
Think of that.
Without Plato, no Yale.

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.750
We would not be here today.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.490
I think that is a fact.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.700
Just ponder that for a moment.

00:14:32.659 --> 00:14:36.059
In fact, let me even say a
little more about this.

00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:40.125
The institutional and
educational requirements of

00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:45.207
Plato's Republic share
many features with a place like

00:14:45.207 --> 00:14:47.129
Yale.
For example,

00:14:47.129 --> 00:14:51.574
in both the Platonic
Kallipolis, the just city,

00:14:51.574 --> 00:14:56.681
as well as this place,
men and women--men and

00:14:56.681 --> 00:15:03.408
women--are selected at a
relatively early age because of

00:15:03.408 --> 00:15:09.431
their capacities for leadership,
for courage,

00:15:09.431 --> 00:15:15.379
for self-discipline,
and responsibility.

00:15:15.379 --> 00:15:23.505
They spend several years living
together, eating together in

00:15:23.505 --> 00:15:28.980
common mess halls,
exercising together,

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:35.100
and studying together,
of course, far from the

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:42.349
oversight of their parents.
The best of them are winnowed

00:15:42.349 --> 00:15:49.017
out to pursue further study and
eventually assume positions of

00:15:49.017 --> 00:15:53.389
public leadership and
responsibility.

00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:57.237
Throughout all of this,
they are subjected to a course

00:15:57.237 --> 00:16:01.665
of rigorous study and physical
training that will lead them to

00:16:01.665 --> 00:16:06.165
adopt prominent positions in the
military and other branches of

00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:10.996
public service.
Does this sound at all familiar

00:16:10.996 --> 00:16:13.340
to you?
It should.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:18.254
Let me put it another way.
If Plato is a fascist,

00:16:18.254 --> 00:16:20.510
what does that make you?

00:16:26.509 --> 00:16:29.980
Plato, of course,
is an extremist.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.720
He pushes his ideas to their
most radical conclusions.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.179
That's what it is to be a
philosopher.

00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:40.399
But he is also defining a kind
of school.

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:44.423
He regards the Politea
or the Republic,

00:16:44.423 --> 00:16:48.446
because that is the original
Greek title of the book,

00:16:48.446 --> 00:16:52.992
Politea or regime.
He regards the politea

00:16:52.992 --> 00:16:57.677
as a school whose chief goal is
preparation for guidance and

00:16:57.677 --> 00:17:02.055
leadership of a community.
If you don't believe me about

00:17:02.055 --> 00:17:05.918
this, maybe you will consider
the words of Jean-Jacques

00:17:05.918 --> 00:17:09.067
Rousseau, one of the great
readers of Plato's

00:17:09.067 --> 00:17:12.031
Republic.
Rousseau wrote in his

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:14.953
Emile,
"To get a good idea of public

00:17:14.953 --> 00:17:18.710
education," he says,
"read Plato's Republic.

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:22.276
It is not a political treatise,
as those who merely judge books

00:17:22.276 --> 00:17:25.468
by their title think,
but it is the finest,

00:17:25.468 --> 00:17:29.740
most beautiful work on
education ever written."

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:35.580
Rousseau.
So, there we go.

00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:46.410
Let's now peek into the book
itself.

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:51.050
Just peek.
We won't go too far.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:51.900
Let's start with the first line.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.050
Who remembers what the first
line is?

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.920
Oh, come on.
You should know this.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.820
You're looking at the book.
You're cheating.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:08.470
"I went down to the Piraeus."
I went down to the Piraeus.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:12.110
Why does Plato begin with this
line?

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:15.480
There's a story that I heard.
I'm not sure if it's altogether

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.929
true, but it's a good story,
at least, about the famous

00:18:18.929 --> 00:18:21.420
German philosopher Martin
Heidegger,

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:25.225
who said that on his first
teaching of the Republic,

00:18:25.225 --> 00:18:30.892
he went through the whole book,
taught the whole book in one

00:18:30.892 --> 00:18:35.516
seminar, one semester.
The last time he taught it,

00:18:35.516 --> 00:18:39.203
the final time he taught it,
he never got beyond the first

00:18:39.203 --> 00:18:41.920
sentence, "I went down to the
Piraeus."

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:45.380
What does it mean?
Why does he begin with this?

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:49.054
"I went down," a going down.
The Greek word for this is

00:18:49.054 --> 00:18:53.630
catabasis.
"I had made a descent."

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.640
There is a book by a famous
contemporary to Plato.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.111
It's a man named Xenophon,
who wrote a book called the

00:19:00.111 --> 00:19:03.478
Anabasis.
The anabasis means a

00:19:03.478 --> 00:19:07.986
going up, an ascent.
But Plato begins this dialogue

00:19:07.986 --> 00:19:12.650
with this stigma.
"I went down."

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:17.322
The descent to the Piraeus.
It is clearly modeled on

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:22.349
Odysseus' descent to Hades in
the Odyssey.

00:19:22.349 --> 00:19:27.222
In fact, the work is a kind of
philosophical odyssey that both

00:19:27.222 --> 00:19:31.112
imitates Homer,
but also anticipates other

00:19:31.112 --> 00:19:36.177
great odysseys of the human
mind, works by those like

00:19:36.177 --> 00:19:39.694
Cervantes or Joyce.
The book is full,

00:19:39.694 --> 00:19:42.930
you will see,
of a number of descents and

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:45.982
ascents.
The most famous climb upward,

00:19:45.982 --> 00:19:50.680
although we will not actually
read these parts for this class,

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.590
concerns the climb to the
divided line,

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:57.420
the famous image of the divided
line in Book VI,

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:01.529
and the ascent to the world of
the imperishable forms.

00:20:01.529 --> 00:20:04.757
Then, in the last book of the
Republic,

00:20:04.757 --> 00:20:07.984
Book X, there is,
once again, a descent to the

00:20:07.984 --> 00:20:10.710
underworld, to the world of
Hades.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:14.073
The work is not,
in a sense, written simply as a

00:20:14.073 --> 00:20:17.079
sort of timeless philosophical
treatise,

00:20:17.079 --> 00:20:23.018
but as a dramatic dialogue with
a setting, a cast of characters

00:20:23.018 --> 00:20:26.849
and a firm location in time and
place.

00:20:26.849 --> 00:20:32.238
Let's say a little more about
that time and place already

00:20:32.238 --> 00:20:37.819
indicated in the sentence,
"I went down to the Piraeus."

00:20:37.819 --> 00:20:44.057
Plato was born in 427,
which is four years after the

00:20:44.057 --> 00:20:48.950
commencement of the
Peloponnesian War.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:54.366
He was a young man of 23 when
the democracy in Athens was

00:20:54.366 --> 00:20:57.569
defeated.
He was only 28 when the

00:20:57.569 --> 00:21:02.219
restored democracy executed his
friend and teacher,

00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:04.080
Socrates, in 399.

00:21:08.279 --> 00:21:11.944
Almost immediately after the
trial of Socrates,

00:21:11.944 --> 00:21:16.883
Plato left Athens and traveled
extensively throughout the Greek

00:21:16.883 --> 00:21:19.070
world.
Upon his return,

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:24.109
he established this school at
Athens he called the Academy,

00:21:24.109 --> 00:21:26.889
for the training of
philosophers,

00:21:26.889 --> 00:21:33.600
statesmen, and legislators.
Plato lived a long time.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:38.282
He lived until the age of 80.
Except for two expeditions to

00:21:38.282 --> 00:21:43.314
Sicily, where he went at the
request of Dionysius to help try

00:21:43.314 --> 00:21:47.759
to establish a philosophical
kingship in Syracuse,

00:21:47.759 --> 00:21:52.890
he remained in Athens teaching
and writing.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:58.949
The Republic belongs to
that period of Plato's work

00:21:58.949 --> 00:22:04.158
after his return to Athens,
after the execution of

00:22:04.158 --> 00:22:08.187
Socrates.
The dominant feature of Plato's

00:22:08.187 --> 00:22:10.664
political theory,
David Grene,

00:22:10.664 --> 00:22:15.459
a great reader of Plato,
has said is "the root and

00:22:15.459 --> 00:22:20.937
branch character of the change
it advocates and existing

00:22:20.937 --> 00:22:25.011
institutions."
Plato's desire for a kind of

00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:29.093
radical makeover,
of Athenian and Greek political

00:22:29.093 --> 00:22:35.379
institutions and cultures,
grew out of his experience of

00:22:35.379 --> 00:22:41.918
political defeat and despair.
The utopianism of the book is,

00:22:41.918 --> 00:22:45.543
in many ways,
the reverse side of the sense

00:22:45.543 --> 00:22:51.066
of profound disillusionment that
he felt at the actual experience

00:22:51.066 --> 00:22:57.483
of the Athenian polis.
This was not only true of his

00:22:57.483 --> 00:23:03.129
experience at home,
but of his failed efforts to

00:23:03.129 --> 00:23:10.216
turn Dionysius' kingship in
Sicily into a successful example

00:23:10.216 --> 00:23:15.900
of philosophical rule.
In fact, we have--and I want to

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:20.624
read to you in just a moment--a
lengthy transcript of Plato's

00:23:20.624 --> 00:23:25.269
own account of why he came to
write the Republic.

00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:27.491
One thing, of course,
you note in the

00:23:27.491 --> 00:23:29.959
Republic,
is that Plato is nowhere

00:23:29.959 --> 00:23:32.534
present.
He is not a participant in his

00:23:32.534 --> 00:23:34.612
own dialogue.
He is the author,

00:23:34.612 --> 00:23:38.909
but not the participant.
We don't know precisely what

00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:41.766
Plato thought,
but we are helped,

00:23:41.766 --> 00:23:46.497
at least, by a kind of
intellectual autobiography that

00:23:46.497 --> 00:23:52.370
he wrote and that we still have,
in what is conventionally

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:55.970
referred to as The Seventh
Letter.

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:59.269
Plato wrote a series of letters
that we have.

00:23:59.269 --> 00:24:02.355
People have argued over the
authenticity of them,

00:24:02.355 --> 00:24:06.339
although I think by now it is
established that they are his.

00:24:06.339 --> 00:24:10.135
In the most famous of these
letters, the lengthy seventh

00:24:10.135 --> 00:24:11.930
one, he gives us,
again,

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:15.930
something of an autobiography
and tells us a little bit about

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:20.250
why he came to write this book.
Isn't this amazing that

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:24.861
2,000-2,500 years ago,
we still have the letters of

00:24:24.861 --> 00:24:29.774
the man who wrote this book?
Let me read to you what Plato

00:24:29.774 --> 00:24:32.819
says about how he came to write
this book.

00:24:32.819 --> 00:24:36.998
"When I was a young man," he
said--and this is written as he

00:24:36.998 --> 00:24:39.611
is very old.
"When I was a young man,

00:24:39.611 --> 00:24:41.839
I felt as yet many young men
do.

00:24:41.839 --> 00:24:46.387
I felt at the very moment I
attained my majority I should

00:24:46.387 --> 00:24:50.954
engage in public affairs.
And there came my way an

00:24:50.954 --> 00:24:55.210
opportunity that I want to tell
you about.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:58.774
The democratic constitution,
then loudly decried by many

00:24:58.774 --> 00:25:01.861
people, was abolished.
And the leaders of the

00:25:01.861 --> 00:25:05.898
revolution set themselves up as
a government of 30 men with

00:25:05.898 --> 00:25:09.952
supreme authority."
He's referring to the Tyranny

00:25:09.952 --> 00:25:14.650
of the Thirty that existed after
the Athenian defeat.

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:18.845
"Some of these men ,
you must understand,

00:25:18.845 --> 00:25:23.670
were relatives of mine and well
known to me.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:27.037
And what is more,
they actually invited me at

00:25:27.037 --> 00:25:30.788
once to join them,
as though politics and I were a

00:25:30.788 --> 00:25:34.080
fit match.
I was very young then and it is

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.730
not surprising that I felt as I
did.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:40.514
I thought that the city was
then living a kind of life which

00:25:40.514 --> 00:25:44.235
was unjust and that they would
bend it to a just one and so

00:25:44.235 --> 00:25:48.486
administer it more justly.
So I eagerly watched to see

00:25:48.486 --> 00:25:51.819
what they would do.
And you must know,

00:25:51.819 --> 00:25:55.931
as I looked on,
I saw those men in a short time

00:25:55.931 --> 00:26:00.670
make the former democracy look
like a golden age."

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:05.918
He is referring to his
relatives, men like Critias and

00:26:05.918 --> 00:26:11.960
Charmides, who turned Athenian
politics into a tyranny and,

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.717
which he says,
makes the "democracy look like

00:26:14.717 --> 00:26:18.438
a golden age."
Let me continue in Plato's

00:26:18.438 --> 00:26:20.286
words.
"I looked at this,

00:26:20.286 --> 00:26:23.015
you see, and at the men who
were in politics,

00:26:23.015 --> 00:26:26.852
at the laws and customs.
And the more I looked and the

00:26:26.852 --> 00:26:30.134
older I grew,
the more difficult it seemed to

00:26:30.134 --> 00:26:33.490
me to administer political
affairs justly.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:37.444
For you cannot do so without
friends and comrades you can

00:26:37.444 --> 00:26:39.734
trust.
In such men it was not easy to

00:26:39.734 --> 00:26:41.236
find.
For the city,

00:26:41.236 --> 00:26:47.019
you see, no longer lived in the
fashion and ways of our fathers.

00:26:47.019 --> 00:26:49.749
Eager as I had once been to go
into politics,

00:26:49.749 --> 00:26:53.532
as I look at these things and
saw everything taking any course

00:26:53.532 --> 00:26:56.200
at all with no direction or
management,

00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:00.802
I ended up feeling dizzy.
I did not abandon my interest

00:27:00.802 --> 00:27:04.224
in politics to discover how it
might be bettered in other

00:27:04.224 --> 00:27:07.829
respects, and I was perpetually
awaiting my opportunity.

00:27:07.829 --> 00:27:11.329
But at last,
I saw that as far as all states

00:27:11.329 --> 00:27:16.049
now existing are concerned,
they are all badly governed.

00:27:16.049 --> 00:27:21.224
For the condition of their laws
is bad almost past cure,

00:27:21.224 --> 00:27:24.799
except for some miraculous
accident.

00:27:24.799 --> 00:27:29.178
So I was compelled to say,
in praising true philosophy,

00:27:29.178 --> 00:27:34.450
that it was from it alone that
was able to discern any justice.

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:38.425
And so I said that the nations
of the world will never cease

00:27:38.425 --> 00:27:42.535
from trouble until either the
true breed of philosophers shall

00:27:42.535 --> 00:27:46.779
come to political office or
until that of the rulers shall,

00:27:46.779 --> 00:27:50.638
by some divine law,
take the pursuit of

00:27:50.638 --> 00:27:55.981
philosophy."
There you see in that wonderful

00:27:55.981 --> 00:28:02.307
and a kind of probing
self-examination of his early

00:28:02.307 --> 00:28:09.492
motives and expectations,
you see the disillusionment of

00:28:09.492 --> 00:28:16.049
the older Plato looking on what
the Tyranny had done.

00:28:16.049 --> 00:28:21.162
But also looking at the states,
the nations of his time,

00:28:21.162 --> 00:28:26.336
seeing their management,
seeing their decay and conflict

00:28:26.336 --> 00:28:31.849
and saying and suggesting that
no justice will ever be expected

00:28:31.849 --> 00:28:34.266
until,
as he says at the end,

00:28:34.266 --> 00:28:37.793
kings become philosophers and
philosophers kings,

00:28:37.793 --> 00:28:41.100
a direct reference to the
Republic.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:48.068
This little autobiography,
goes on at considerably greater

00:28:48.068 --> 00:28:51.252
length, I should say.
But this provides a kind of

00:28:51.252 --> 00:28:53.092
introduction,
as it were, to the

00:28:53.092 --> 00:28:56.818
Republic.
We have in Plato's own words

00:28:56.818 --> 00:29:01.922
here, the way he viewed politics
and his reasons for his

00:29:01.922 --> 00:29:05.996
political philosophy.
Yet, in many respects,

00:29:05.996 --> 00:29:11.115
if the Republic was the
result of comprehensive despair

00:29:11.115 --> 00:29:15.480
and disillusionment with the
prospects of reform,

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:20.469
the dialogue itself points back
to an earlier moment in Plato's

00:29:20.469 --> 00:29:23.849
life and the life of the city of
Athens.

00:29:23.849 --> 00:29:28.981
This remarkable letter was
written when Plato was very old,

00:29:28.981 --> 00:29:33.759
approximately 50 years after
the trial and execution of

00:29:33.759 --> 00:29:36.378
Socrates.
But the action of the

00:29:36.378 --> 00:29:40.574
Republic takes place long
before the defeat of Athens,

00:29:40.574 --> 00:29:44.910
before the rise of the Thirty
and the execution of Athens .

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:49.989
It refers to that period that
Plato says in the letter looked

00:29:49.989 --> 00:29:53.544
like "a golden age,
when many things seemed

00:29:53.544 --> 00:29:56.723
possible."
That brings us back to the

00:29:56.723 --> 00:29:59.559
opening, the descent to the
Piraeus.

00:29:59.559 --> 00:30:04.414
The action of the dialogue
begins at the Piraeus,

00:30:04.414 --> 00:30:10.180
the port city of Athens,
somewhere around the year 411,

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.381
during what was called the
Peace of Nicias,

00:30:13.381 --> 00:30:16.736
that is to say,
the peace that endured a kind

00:30:16.736 --> 00:30:19.920
of respite,
truce that was established

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.609
during the fighting between
Sparta and Athens.

00:30:23.609 --> 00:30:27.906
At the very beginning of the
dialogue, we see Socrates and

00:30:27.906 --> 00:30:31.430
his friend Glaucon.
What are they doing?

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.830
What are they doing?

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:39.608
Do you remember?
What are they doing at the very

00:30:39.608 --> 00:30:42.438
beginning?
Student: Professor

00:30:42.438 --> 00:30:45.095
Steven Smith: Where?
Student: [inaudible]

00:30:45.095 --> 00:30:46.299
Professor Steven Smith:
Right.

00:30:46.299 --> 00:30:49.807
Let me put it a slightly--yes,
they are walking back to Athens

00:30:49.807 --> 00:30:53.784
from the Piraeus.
But maybe to put it a slightly

00:30:53.784 --> 00:30:57.053
different way,
they're trolling the

00:30:57.053 --> 00:31:00.900
waterfront.
What is the Piraeus?

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:05.830
It is the harbor of Athens.
What do you expect from harbors?

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:13.122
What are harbor cities like?
What do you find down at

00:31:13.122 --> 00:31:15.140
harbors?
Student: [inaudible]

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:15.890
Professor Steven Smith:
Water, yeah.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:20.387
They're seedy, aren't they?
You find various kinds of

00:31:20.387 --> 00:31:25.309
disreputable and maybe unseemly
things going on there.

00:31:25.309 --> 00:31:29.858
We are forced to ask ourselves:
What are Socrates and Glaucon

00:31:29.858 --> 00:31:33.340
doing there?
Why are they there together?

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:38.890
What are they doing?
What do they expect to find?

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:42.630
These seem to be questions that
immediately come to mind.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:47.247
We learn shortly afterwards
that they have taken this

00:31:47.247 --> 00:31:52.930
descent to the Piraeus to view a
festival, a kind of carnival.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:58.186
It sounds like something one
might expect to see in a Fellini

00:31:58.186 --> 00:32:00.356
film.
A kind of carnival,

00:32:00.356 --> 00:32:02.978
a carnivale,
a Mardi Gras,

00:32:02.978 --> 00:32:06.799
where a festival is going on.
What's more,

00:32:06.799 --> 00:32:12.099
a new goddess is being
introduced into the pantheon of

00:32:12.099 --> 00:32:14.670
deities.
This seems to suggest

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:17.609
that--referring back to the
Apology,

00:32:17.609 --> 00:32:22.694
that it is not Socrates,
but the Athenians who innovate,

00:32:22.694 --> 00:32:26.609
who create and introduce new
deities.

00:32:26.609 --> 00:32:31.576
Socrates remarks that the
Thracians, the display of the

00:32:31.576 --> 00:32:35.855
Thracians, put on a good show,
showing that his own

00:32:35.855 --> 00:32:39.259
perspective is not simply bound
by that of a city.

00:32:39.259 --> 00:32:41.245
It suggests,
from the beginning,

00:32:41.245 --> 00:32:44.446
a kind of loftiness and
impartiality of perspective

00:32:44.446 --> 00:32:46.880
characteristic of the
philosopher,

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:52.335
but not necessarily the citizen.
On their way back from this

00:32:52.335 --> 00:32:57.286
festival, from this carnival,
on their way back they're

00:32:57.286 --> 00:33:01.668
accosted, you remember.
They're accosted by a slave

00:33:01.668 --> 00:33:05.517
who's been sent on by
Polemarchus and his friends and

00:33:05.517 --> 00:33:08.700
who orders Socrates and Glaucon
to wait.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:14.640
"Polemarchus orders you to
wait," the slave says.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.600
He orders you to wait.
He is coming up behind you.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.860
Just wait.

00:33:22.759 --> 00:33:25.759
"Of course we'll wait," Glaucon
replies.

00:33:25.759 --> 00:33:29.058
When Polemarchus and his
friends arrive,

00:33:29.058 --> 00:33:32.950
we find that his friends
include Adeimantus,

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:37.070
who is Glaucon's brother and
Niceratus, who is the son of

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:41.779
Nicias, the general who has just
brokered the peace that they are

00:33:41.779 --> 00:33:45.369
now enjoying.
That's the famous Peace of

00:33:45.369 --> 00:33:48.119
Nicias.
They challenge Socrates.

00:33:48.119 --> 00:33:51.720
"Stay with us or prove
stronger."

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.390
Stay with us or prove stronger.
"Could we not persuade you?"

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:58.111
Socrates asked.
"Could we not persuade you to

00:33:58.111 --> 00:34:01.501
let us go?"
"Not if we won't listen,"

00:34:01.501 --> 00:34:05.791
Polemarchus says.
Instead, they reach a

00:34:05.791 --> 00:34:09.540
compromise.
But Socrates and Glaucon come

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:14.521
with Polemarchus and the others
to the home of Polemarchus'

00:34:14.521 --> 00:34:17.764
father,
where dinner will be provided

00:34:17.764 --> 00:34:21.874
for them, and later,
a return to the festival where

00:34:21.874 --> 00:34:27.493
there will be a horseback race.
"It seems," Glaucon says,

00:34:27.493 --> 00:34:33.199
"we must stay."
And Socrates concurs.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:37.325
Why does the book begin with
this, let's say,

00:34:37.325 --> 00:34:42.342
opening gambit?
Is it simply a ruse to get the

00:34:42.342 --> 00:34:49.073
reader's attention in some sense
or to rope you in with some

00:34:49.073 --> 00:34:55.223
promise of what's to follow?
Already from the very opening

00:34:55.223 --> 00:35:00.268
lines we see in this a clue to
the theme that is going to

00:35:00.268 --> 00:35:03.860
follow.
Who has the title to rule?

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.990
Is it Polemarchus and his
friends who claim to rule by

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:10.199
strength of numbers?
"Can we persuade you?"

00:35:10.199 --> 00:35:13.039
"Not if we don't listen," he
says.

00:35:13.039 --> 00:35:16.924
Or Socrates and Glaucon,
who hope to rule by the powers

00:35:16.924 --> 00:35:19.370
of reason, speech,
and argument?

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:23.670
Can we convince you?
Can we persuade you?

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:27.021
Can democracy that expresses
the will of the majority,

00:35:27.021 --> 00:35:30.878
the will of the greater number
be rendered compatible with the

00:35:30.878 --> 00:35:34.419
needs of philosophy and the
claims to respect only reason

00:35:34.419 --> 00:35:38.637
and a better argument?
That seems to be the question

00:35:38.637 --> 00:35:41.760
already posed in this opening
scene.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.349
Can a compromise be reached
between the two?

00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:50.110
Can the strength of numbers,
as well as respect for reason

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:53.367
and a better argument be,
in some sense,

00:35:53.367 --> 00:35:58.019
harmonized?
Can they be brought together?

00:35:58.019 --> 00:36:01.706
Is the just city,
perhaps, that Socrates will

00:36:01.706 --> 00:36:05.476
later consider,
a combination of these two--of

00:36:05.476 --> 00:36:10.518
both force and persuasion?
That will be something left to

00:36:10.518 --> 00:36:14.028
see.
But I think you can see the big

00:36:14.028 --> 00:36:20.205
themes of the book already very
present in the opening scene of

00:36:20.205 --> 00:36:25.052
the dialogue.
The first book is really a kind

00:36:25.052 --> 00:36:29.250
of preamble to everything that
follows.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:39.340
Okay?
Are you with me so far on this?

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:43.762
Let's talk a little bit about
the participants in this

00:36:43.762 --> 00:36:46.710
dialogue.
It is a dialogue.

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:53.401
It has a fairly large number of
characters, although only a

00:36:53.401 --> 00:36:59.170
relatively few number of them
speak in the book.

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:03.917
Yet, it's something very
important, as we would want to

00:37:03.917 --> 00:37:07.170
know in any play or novel or
movie.

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:13.165
We want to note something about
the particular people who

00:37:13.165 --> 00:37:19.588
inhabit this dinner party that
Socrates and Glaucon have been

00:37:19.588 --> 00:37:23.249
promised.
Who are they and what do they

00:37:23.249 --> 00:37:24.110
represent?

00:37:28.659 --> 00:37:32.920
There is Cephalus,
who we will see very quickly,

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:38.539
the father of Polemarchus and
whose home they are attending.

00:37:38.539 --> 00:37:41.058
The venerable
paterfamilias,

00:37:41.058 --> 00:37:43.800
the venerable father of the
family.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:47.048
Polemarchus,
his son, a solid patriot who

00:37:47.048 --> 00:37:51.840
defends not only his father's
honor, but that of his friends

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:56.586
and fellow citizens.
We will also see Thrasymachus,

00:37:56.586 --> 00:38:01.807
a cynical intellectual who
rivals Socrates as an educator

00:38:01.807 --> 00:38:07.115
of future leaders and statesmen.
Of course, it is the exchange

00:38:07.115 --> 00:38:10.711
between Socrates and
Thrasymachus that is one of the

00:38:10.711 --> 00:38:15.374
most famous moments of the book.
There is, in the first set of

00:38:15.374 --> 00:38:18.929
dialogues, a distinct hierarchy
of characters,

00:38:18.929 --> 00:38:22.538
you might say,
who we see later on express

00:38:22.538 --> 00:38:27.289
those distinctive features of
the soul and the city.

00:38:27.289 --> 00:38:31.187
Cephalus, we learn,
has spent his life in the

00:38:31.187 --> 00:38:33.864
acquisitive arts.
That is to say,

00:38:33.864 --> 00:38:37.026
he's a businessman.
He's been concerned with

00:38:37.026 --> 00:38:40.929
satisfying the needs of his body
and making money.

00:38:40.929 --> 00:38:45.161
He represents what will later
be called in the Republic

00:38:45.161 --> 00:38:48.559
the appetitive part of the soul,
the appetites.

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:52.426
Polemarchus,
whose name actually means

00:38:52.426 --> 00:38:56.650
"warlord."
Think of that.

00:38:56.650 --> 00:39:02.539
The warlord is preoccupied with
questions of honor and loyalty.

00:39:02.539 --> 00:39:04.943
He tells us,
to get a little bit ahead of

00:39:04.943 --> 00:39:08.428
ourselves, that justice is
helping your friends and harming

00:39:08.428 --> 00:39:11.099
your enemies.
He seems to represent what

00:39:11.099 --> 00:39:14.715
Plato or Socrates will later
call the spirited part of the

00:39:14.715 --> 00:39:17.570
soul, something that we want to
return to.

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:19.994
Thrasymachus,
a visiting sophist,

00:39:19.994 --> 00:39:24.162
seeks to teach and educate,
anticipating what the

00:39:24.162 --> 00:39:27.800
Republic will call the
rational soul,

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.267
the rational part of the soul.
Each of these figures,

00:39:31.267 --> 00:39:34.442
in many ways,
prefigure the relatively

00:39:34.442 --> 00:39:39.590
superior natures of those who
come later in the dialogue.

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:43.025
The two brothers,
Glaucon and Adeimantus,

00:39:43.025 --> 00:39:46.460
whose exchange with Socrates
occupies,

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.955
for the most part,
the rest of the dialogue from

00:39:49.955 --> 00:39:52.929
Book Two onward,
the two brothers who,

00:39:52.929 --> 00:39:57.210
incidentally,
are the brothers of Plato.

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:59.879
I should say,
to my knowledge,

00:39:59.879 --> 00:40:04.757
we know nothing more about
Glaucon and Adeimantus from

00:40:04.757 --> 00:40:09.360
history, but Plato put them into
his dialogue.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.878
They will always be remembered
as the two brothers in the

00:40:12.878 --> 00:40:15.838
dialogue.
Again, they seem to represent

00:40:15.838 --> 00:40:19.990
something quite different.
Bear this in mind as you are

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:23.342
reading the book,
because it is easy to kind of

00:40:23.342 --> 00:40:26.840
forget who's talking and what
they represent.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:32.586
Adeimantus is,
we will find,

00:40:32.586 --> 00:40:37.699
the kind of hedonistic and
pleasure-seeking brother.

00:40:37.699 --> 00:40:43.346
Glaucon, whose name means
something like "gleaming",

00:40:43.346 --> 00:40:49.989
"shining," is the fierce and
war-like of the two brothers.

00:40:49.989 --> 00:40:53.059
Of course, there is the
philosophically-minded Socrates.

00:40:53.059 --> 00:40:57.346
Again, each of them seems to
represent, in a superior way,

00:40:57.346 --> 00:41:00.280
the key components of the human
soul,

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.473
the appetitive,
the war-like or spirited,

00:41:03.473 --> 00:41:08.457
and the rational.
Together, these figures form a

00:41:08.457 --> 00:41:14.216
kind of microcosm of humanity.
Each of the participants in the

00:41:14.216 --> 00:41:18.499
dialogue represents one of the
specific classes or groups that

00:41:18.499 --> 00:41:22.853
will eventually occupy the just
city to which Plato or Socrates

00:41:22.853 --> 00:41:26.540
gives the name Kallipolis,
the beautiful city.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:29.970
Alright?

00:41:36.059 --> 00:41:40.793
In the five minutes or so that
remain, let's just talk for a

00:41:40.793 --> 00:41:44.884
moment about the first
conversation with the head of

00:41:44.884 --> 00:41:48.781
the family, Cephalus.
We don't need to look at this

00:41:48.781 --> 00:41:51.612
at great length.
You can, I'm sure in your

00:41:51.612 --> 00:41:55.745
sections, you might want to talk
about the arguments a little

00:41:55.745 --> 00:41:59.809
more specifically that are used
in these first three sets of

00:41:59.809 --> 00:42:04.639
conversations between Cephalus,
Polemarchus, and Thrasymachus.

00:42:04.639 --> 00:42:06.265
The question,
more importantly-- the

00:42:06.265 --> 00:42:08.679
question, I don't know that it's
more importantly,

00:42:08.679 --> 00:42:12.822
but the question that I want us
to examine a little bit here in

00:42:12.822 --> 00:42:16.153
the time remaining is what,
again, these characters

00:42:16.153 --> 00:42:19.534
represent.
Cephalus, as his name implies,

00:42:19.534 --> 00:42:21.030
Cephalus.
What does that mean?

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:24.221
Do you know?
Head, yes, Cephalus,

00:42:24.221 --> 00:42:30.388
head, the head of the
household, but also clearly the

00:42:30.388 --> 00:42:33.591
claims of age,
of tradition,

00:42:33.591 --> 00:42:36.799
of family.
At the beginning of the

00:42:36.799 --> 00:42:40.278
dialogue when Polemarchus
brought his friends back to the

00:42:40.278 --> 00:42:42.949
house, we see the aged father,
Cephalus.

00:42:42.949 --> 00:42:45.679
He is just returning from
prayer.

00:42:45.679 --> 00:42:49.687
He has just returned from
performing certain acts of

00:42:49.687 --> 00:42:52.683
ritual sacrifice.
He greets Socrates,

00:42:52.683 --> 00:42:55.690
in many ways,
as a long, lost friend.

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:59.512
Perhaps you have had this
experience yourself,

00:42:59.512 --> 00:43:02.739
always a slightly uncomfortable
one.

00:43:02.739 --> 00:43:07.590
When you bring a group of your
friends back to your house,

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:10.909
you're expecting to have a good
time,

00:43:10.909 --> 00:43:14.185
and your grandparent is there
and says, "Oh,

00:43:14.185 --> 00:43:17.690
it's so good to see a bunch of
young people.

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:21.718
I want to talk with you."
It's always a slightly

00:43:21.718 --> 00:43:24.809
uncomfortable moment,
you might say.

00:43:24.809 --> 00:43:29.690
We all have experienced this
kind of thing.

00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:32.730
Everybody knows it from either
end.

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:34.730
I'm not a grandparent,
thank god.

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:39.762
But I feel the same thing often
when my son brings his friends,

00:43:39.762 --> 00:43:43.010
maybe that I've known for a
long time.

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:48.829
"Oh, how are you doing?"
and they want to get away.

00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:53.380
Socrates does something rather
abrupt.

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:58.809
"Tell me, Cephalus,
what's it like to be so old?"

00:43:58.809 --> 00:44:01.500
"What is it like to be like
you?"

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:06.159
"Do you still feel the need for
sex?"

00:44:06.159 --> 00:44:11.019
Can you imagine saying that to
someone's grandfather?

00:44:11.019 --> 00:44:14.280
It gives you a little idea of
the character of Socrates.

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:19.584
Cephalus is so happy.
"Oh, thank god I'm past that,"

00:44:19.584 --> 00:44:22.322
he says.
"Thank god I no longer feel

00:44:22.322 --> 00:44:24.955
this erotic desire.
At my old age,

00:44:24.955 --> 00:44:28.687
I can spend my time--" "When I
was a young man,

00:44:28.687 --> 00:44:31.753
that's all I did.
I was thinking about sex all

00:44:31.753 --> 00:44:34.125
the time and when I wasn't
thinking about that,

00:44:34.125 --> 00:44:37.732
I was making money.
But now I've had my fill of

00:44:37.732 --> 00:44:43.409
both and I can spend my later
years, the twilight of my life,

00:44:43.409 --> 00:44:47.595
turning to the things about the
gods, performing sacrifices

00:44:47.595 --> 00:44:52.769
commanded by the gods."
Why does Plato begin this way?

00:44:52.769 --> 00:44:56.031
Well, Cephalus is,
as should be clear,

00:44:56.031 --> 00:44:59.469
the very embodiment of the
conventional,

00:44:59.469 --> 00:45:03.792
in both senses of that term.
He's not a bad man,

00:45:03.792 --> 00:45:06.533
by any means.
But he is a thoroughly

00:45:06.533 --> 00:45:10.532
unreflective one.
In attacking Cephalus as he

00:45:10.532 --> 00:45:15.659
does, Socrates attacks the
embodiment of conventional

00:45:15.659 --> 00:45:19.800
opinion, the Nomos supporting
the city.

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:24.194
Note the way Socrates
manipulates the dialogue,

00:45:24.194 --> 00:45:28.511
the conversation.
Cephalus says that the pious

00:45:28.511 --> 00:45:33.515
man, the just man practices
justice by sacrificing to the

00:45:33.515 --> 00:45:36.434
gods.
Socrates turns that into the

00:45:36.434 --> 00:45:41.079
statement that justice means
paying your debts and returning

00:45:41.079 --> 00:45:44.717
what is owed to you.
Cephalus, in an easygoing

00:45:44.717 --> 00:45:49.030
manner, agrees and then Socrates
says, "What would you think

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:53.343
about returning a weapon that
you had borrowed from a friend

00:45:53.343 --> 00:45:57.290
or someone who was in a very
depressed"--we might say a

00:45:57.290 --> 00:46:01.480
depressed "frame of mind.
Would that be just?

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:05.066
How do you explain that?
Would you do that if justice

00:46:05.066 --> 00:46:08.300
means paying your debts and
giving back to each what is

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.373
owed?"
At that moment,

00:46:10.373 --> 00:46:15.589
Cephalus excuses himself from
the dialogue and says,

00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:20.293
rather abruptly,
"I have to go out and continue

00:46:20.293 --> 00:46:25.701
my sacrifices in the garden."
Socrates, in other words,

00:46:25.701 --> 00:46:29.331
has broken the bond of
tradition and traditional

00:46:29.331 --> 00:46:33.888
authority that holds the ancient
city and the ancient family

00:46:33.888 --> 00:46:36.851
together.
Cephalus is banished from the

00:46:36.851 --> 00:46:40.189
dialogue.
Tradition is banished and we

00:46:40.189 --> 00:46:46.239
never hear another word about it
for the next 400 or so pages.

00:46:46.239 --> 00:46:50.463
That's the way Socrates begins
this dialogue,

00:46:50.463 --> 00:46:55.070
or that's the way Plato has
Socrates begin it.

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:59.846
We'll look a little more at
some of these in our class for

00:46:59.846 --> 00:47:04.874
next time and then move into the
characters of Adeimantus and

00:47:04.874 --> 00:47:07.910
Glaucon.
Anyway, start your reading.

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:11.663
Continue your reading.
Your sections are going on this

00:47:11.663 --> 00:47:13.463
week, so enjoy yourselves.

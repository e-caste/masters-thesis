00:00:02.067 --> 00:00:03.900
PAUL FREEDMAN: Now we're
going to talk about Islam.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.400
And here we enter into a segment
that, in a sense, is

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.300
the most relevant, if relevance
is a criterion, sort

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.167
of is, to today's world.

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:20.200
Because these controversies
that play out today Shiism

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.800
versus Sunni, for example, the
nature of Islam, its appeal as

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.300
a religion on a world scale are
obviously established in

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.967
the period that we're
talking about.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:35.533
They were established slowly.

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.400
One of the things that you'll
have noticed from the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.467
assignment is that the author,
Berkey, emphasizes very much

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:48.800
that Islam is slow in formation,
that it's not fully

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.833
grown as this militant movement
with a set of rules

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:58.333
in 632, the year that
Mohammed dies.

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.833
And because of that, then, it's
not to be understood as

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:06.233
some militant,
conversion-oriented,

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:10.133
jihado-centric religion
from the start.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:17.833
I said at one point when we were
summarizing the end of

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:20.400
the Roman Empire that there
were three heirs

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.300
to the Roman Empire.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.533
One was the Church--

00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:30.533
ironic because, of course, the
Church had grown up persecuted

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:31.833
by the Empire.

00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:34.133
The other was the Byzantine
Empire, the

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:37.367
Eastern Roman Empire.

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:42.300
Remember that it called itself
simply "the Roman Empire." So

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.400
that's the most clear claim
being staked to succession to

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.400
the Roman Empire.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.733
And that the third was Islam.

00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:53.033
And a couple of you said, well
Islam, that's the most

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:54.300
surprising of all, actually.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.567
And I didn't really elaborate
at that time.

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:58.467
And that's not the center
of what we're going

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:00.767
to be talking about.

00:02:00.767 --> 00:02:01.800
Because time moves on.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.900
We're in the seventh century,
the collapse of the Roman

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.733
Empire in the west is
established two and a half,

00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:12.233
two centuries earlier.

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:19.300
But Islam, although developed
in Arabia, outside of the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.367
Roman empire, and although very
strong in places like

00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:29.233
Persia or the western part of
India, would in many respects

00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:34.267
take up the inheritance of the
Roman and Byzantine Empires.

00:02:34.267 --> 00:02:38.200
The conquests on the
Mediterranean, in the east,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.500
and in the south; its
architectural and artistic

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.733
style; its administrative
structure; and not least, the

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:52.133
translation and elaborations
of Greek science, medicine,

00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:57.833
and other academic forms,
including, for example, the

00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:01.267
translation of Aristotle and
the influence of Aristotle

00:03:01.267 --> 00:03:06.300
would be signs of,
evidence of the

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.933
significance of Islam within--

00:03:10.933 --> 00:03:13.067
it's pointless to debate whether
it's the Western

00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:16.233
tradition or what the Western
tradition means--

00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:20.900
but within the classical legacy,
within what it means

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.067
to say that Rome as a polity
ceased to exist in the west

00:03:26.067 --> 00:03:30.667
and yet the classical world
has continued to influence

00:03:30.667 --> 00:03:34.500
society and ideas to this day.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.500
So in talking about the history
of Islam, one is

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:48.767
inevitably going to
be emphasizing its

00:03:48.767 --> 00:03:50.367
revolutionary nature.

00:03:50.367 --> 00:03:53.700
And so I'm going to go against
the reading in some sense.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.533
Or the reading is intended to
go against the conventional

00:03:57.533 --> 00:04:00.567
way of presenting the early
history of Islam.

00:04:00.567 --> 00:04:03.167
And that can be sometimes
annoying.

00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:07.533
The writer is cautioning you
against views you never had.

00:04:07.533 --> 00:04:11.067
Or the writer keeps on saying,
"Well, we should not think

00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:14.200
that this"-- and I hadn't
thought that.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.033
Just tell me what you think
happened in early Islam.

00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:19.100
My apologies for that.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.233
Writers are always writing
against other writers.

00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:19.367
Scholars are always writing
against a prevailing

00:04:19.367 --> 00:04:20.600
interpretation.

00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:28.600
Berkey is a continuist, and
that is the scholarly

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.600
consensus now, arguing against
this notion of Islam bursting

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:42.633
forth like some kind of pent-up
explosion in Arabia.

00:04:42.633 --> 00:04:45.000
But Arabia is off the map.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.733
Islam as a movement, and
certainly the Arab conquests,

00:04:49.733 --> 00:04:54.500
are unpredictable events.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.300
They may be understandable later
in terms of developments

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.867
in the Near East, both religious
and cultural, but up

00:05:06.867 --> 00:05:10.267
until the seventh century Arabia
was on the periphery of

00:05:10.267 --> 00:05:15.167
the two great controlling
empires to its north, namely

00:05:15.167 --> 00:05:19.133
Persia and Rome.

00:05:19.133 --> 00:05:21.833
And we are taking Byzantium
as the heir of

00:05:21.833 --> 00:05:24.600
Rome in this sense.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.267
The problem with Arabia is
that it is really dry.

00:05:30.267 --> 00:05:36.833
And before the discovery of oil,
or more precisely, before

00:05:36.833 --> 00:05:40.833
the discovery that oil was
useful, important, and

00:05:40.833 --> 00:05:46.600
valuable, it was a strikingly
impoverished land in terms of

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.233
natural resources.

00:05:48.233 --> 00:05:52.767
"A terrible land," as Isaiah
the prophet says.

00:05:52.767 --> 00:05:57.333
Isaiah 21:1; "the burden of
the desert of the sea.

00:05:57.333 --> 00:06:00.800
As whirlwinds in the south pass
through it, so it cometh

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.567
from the desert, from
a terrible land."

00:06:04.567 --> 00:06:07.000
Now, Isaiah actually grew up
in what most of us would

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.133
consider to be pretty
dry circumstances.

00:06:11.133 --> 00:06:15.400
The eastern Mediterranean,
modern-day Israel, Lebanon,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:22.233
Syria are hot and dry compared
to bounteous

00:06:22.233 --> 00:06:23.700
climes like New Haven.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.800
So the Eastern Mediterranean,
however, is a land of fertile

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.500
oases, river valleys like the
famed Tigris/ Euphrates/

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:43.867
Fertile Crescent area, coastal
cities with commerce, whereas

00:06:43.867 --> 00:06:48.633
Arabia is essentially
a vast expanse of

00:06:48.633 --> 00:06:52.567
barely habitable terrain.

00:06:52.567 --> 00:06:56.500
It is isolated by the
sea on three sides.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.900
It has very few natural
harbors.

00:07:03.433 --> 00:07:10.267
There are no lakes, no forest,
no grasslands, even, and no

00:07:10.267 --> 00:07:11.767
rivers that run year-round.

00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:23.100
The only intrinsically favorable
part of it is the

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.867
southwest corner,
modern Yemen.

00:07:26.867 --> 00:07:29.700
This was in the ancient world,
or at least to the Roman

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.833
geographers, "Arabia Felix,"
Happy Arabia.

00:07:33.833 --> 00:07:34.933
Nice Arabia.

00:07:34.933 --> 00:07:37.533
And indeed, there were two
kingdoms that emerged here

00:07:37.533 --> 00:07:39.567
around 1000 BC.

00:07:39.567 --> 00:07:45.967
Harbors, oases, and these two
kingdoms controlled the spice

00:07:45.967 --> 00:07:52.267
and incense trade from India and
from the Horn of Africa.

00:07:52.267 --> 00:07:56.233
These are two extremely valuable
kinds of products for

00:07:56.233 --> 00:08:01.333
religious, gastronomic, and
medicinal purposes.

00:08:01.333 --> 00:08:04.300
And most of the spices
come from India.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:10.667
And most of the incense comes
from modern Somalia, Ethiopia,

00:08:10.667 --> 00:08:12.667
places along the Red Sea.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.800
By the time of Mohammed,
however, southern Arabia's

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.533
best days had passed.

00:08:21.533 --> 00:08:27.333
And Mohammed is, of course, from
central, and in the sense

00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:29.567
of its orientation, really,
northern Arabia.

00:08:33.033 --> 00:08:33.200
The worst desert in Arabia
is the south.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.100
So just when you get out of
Yemen going northeast you come

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:41.800
to an area that still bears
the not really encouraging

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.633
name, the Empty Quarter.

00:08:44.633 --> 00:08:48.100
This is really serious,
no-oases desert.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.000
Further north, however, in
places like Mecca or Medina,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.900
there is enough water for
settlement, though not enough

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.133
for agriculture.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.100
A key event in the history of
Arabia is the domestication of

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:13.733
the camel, which can be situated
around 1000 BC.

00:09:13.733 --> 00:09:18.300
Arabia, outside of the Yemenite
kingdoms, was mostly

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.900
nomadic, though there were
trading cities of which the

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.333
most famous are Mecca
and Medina.

00:09:29.433 --> 00:09:32.800
These cities were rather
cosmopolitan.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.133
They had Arabs and
other peoples.

00:09:35.133 --> 00:09:38.300
They had Christians, some of
whom were Arabs, some of whom

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.633
were not, and Jews, many of
whom were also Arabs.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.400
They controlled overland trade,
again, from further

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:56.300
east, bearing exotic products
like spices from India,

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.567
organizing caravans.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.033
At times they would form
kingdoms, at times there would

00:10:04.033 --> 00:10:07.500
be Arab kingdoms in the north,
but generally these are

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.567
feuding societies organized
along tribal lines.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.967
Looked at from the Roman or
Persian empire, Arabia was a

00:10:17.967 --> 00:10:23.233
little bit like the forests of
Germany: a hostile terrain--

00:10:23.233 --> 00:10:26.667
from the Roman point of view,
Persian point of view--

00:10:26.667 --> 00:10:31.167
inhabited by useful but
presumably barbarian and

00:10:31.167 --> 00:10:36.233
presumably not very interesting
people.

00:10:36.233 --> 00:10:40.500
This is the point of view
of the Bible as well.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:45.100
They are primitive people
bearing interesting products,

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.667
inhabiting a land that's
not worth having.

00:10:47.667 --> 00:10:50.333
Not worth invading, not
worth owning, not

00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:52.633
worth dealing with.

00:10:52.633 --> 00:10:58.267
The first mention of Arabs
seems to be 854 BC when,

00:10:58.267 --> 00:11:01.900
according to a Syrian
inscription, a certain

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:06.133
Gindibu, the Arab, contributed
1,000 camels to forces

00:11:06.133 --> 00:11:09.100
revolting against
the Assyrians.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.400
The Arabs, henceforth, after
854 mentioned often in

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.233
Babylonian and Persian texts.

00:11:16.233 --> 00:11:20.467
They're always frontiersmen or
people inhabiting a land

00:11:20.467 --> 00:11:21.700
beyond a frontier.

00:11:25.633 --> 00:11:28.867
Questions so far?

00:11:28.867 --> 00:11:30.867
OK.

00:11:30.867 --> 00:11:36.000
Not all Arabs are nomads, but
the Bedouin, Bedouin in this

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.167
sense meaning Arab nomad, is
sort of the Ur Arab, the

00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:44.533
original Arab, the defining
archetype and the original

00:11:44.533 --> 00:11:49.233
colloquial meaning
of the word Arab.

00:11:49.233 --> 00:11:51.633
In a way the Bedouins are a
little like the Germanic

00:11:51.633 --> 00:11:54.167
tribes, an analogy I'll mention
but I don't want to

00:11:54.167 --> 00:11:55.667
push too hard.

00:11:55.667 --> 00:12:02.900
They form extended kinship
units, that is to say they

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:07.900
know who their second cousins
are and care about them.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:13.800
And these extended kinship
units form a

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.067
kind of tribal structure.

00:12:18.933 --> 00:12:24.067
This notion of tribe remains
important to this day.

00:12:24.067 --> 00:12:28.033
You'll have seen, in accounts
of post-Qaddafi Libya, for

00:12:28.033 --> 00:12:32.333
example, the cliche and probably
accurate, is there is

00:12:32.333 --> 00:12:34.067
no tradition of government.

00:12:34.067 --> 00:12:38.367
Qaddafi didn't govern,
he just tyrannized.

00:12:38.367 --> 00:12:40.800
And there are no civil
institutions.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.933
It is divided by tribal
loyalties.

00:12:44.933 --> 00:12:47.967
What does tribe mean in that?

00:12:47.967 --> 00:12:51.200
I actually don't know
in terms of Libya.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.667
It is a way of saying the people
do not have loyalty to

00:12:54.667 --> 00:13:00.800
the state, but to some extended
kinship group, or

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.733
what's sometimes called "fictive
kinship group." I'm

00:13:03.733 --> 00:13:08.467
not really related to you, but
we have either the same name

00:13:08.467 --> 00:13:13.767
or we're from the same place or
we consider each other kin

00:13:13.767 --> 00:13:16.700
and therefore have a
certain protective

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.633
sense about each other.

00:13:18.633 --> 00:13:21.400
This is very useful if you
don't have a government.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.167
We've already spoken about this
in terms of our question

00:13:24.167 --> 00:13:28.000
of what held Merovingian
society together.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.167
Your second cousin becomes
important to you if there's no

00:13:31.167 --> 00:13:34.933
police force, if there's no
way of making sure that

00:13:34.933 --> 00:13:38.467
someone is not going to kill
you just for fun or because

00:13:38.467 --> 00:13:42.067
they got angry at you.

00:13:42.067 --> 00:13:46.033
Under the circumstances we live
in, we don't care about

00:13:46.033 --> 00:13:46.967
our second cousins.

00:13:46.967 --> 00:13:48.533
We don't know who they are.

00:13:48.533 --> 00:13:51.467
We don't expect anything
from them.

00:13:51.467 --> 00:13:55.033
In a society in which family
is not just a sentimental

00:13:55.033 --> 00:13:59.967
attachment, but it actually is
what is protecting your life,

00:13:59.967 --> 00:14:01.733
kinship is very important.

00:14:01.733 --> 00:14:04.133
Bedouins as well as
Germans, then.

00:14:04.133 --> 00:14:07.833
The problem with kinship is that
while it's a very solid

00:14:07.833 --> 00:14:12.200
attachment, it's also
an irritant.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:17.033
And here we're not talking about
arguments over whose

00:14:17.033 --> 00:14:23.767
Christmas is better or who gets
the Venetian glass vase

00:14:23.767 --> 00:14:28.600
after Mom and Dad's death, we're
talking about terrible

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:34.933
arguments, feuds that are
within a kinship group.

00:14:34.933 --> 00:14:40.600
So you have feuds within the
kin groups or tribes, and

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.100
feuds between tribes,
accentuated in this

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.867
case often by water.

00:14:45.867 --> 00:14:50.533
Water, a scarce resource,
obviously, and one that people

00:14:50.533 --> 00:14:54.667
fight about a lot in terms
of territorial feuds.

00:14:54.667 --> 00:15:00.600
So the Bedouins tend to have
more feuds than the Germans.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.933
There's no Bedouin equivalent
of wergild.

00:15:02.933 --> 00:15:08.100
Remember, the wergild is the
price that you have to pay to

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.700
make someone have peace with
you, even if you've killed

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:13.333
their relatives.

00:15:13.333 --> 00:15:16.067
It's the worth of a person.

00:15:16.067 --> 00:15:18.067
It's compensation.

00:15:18.067 --> 00:15:22.467
And then other people can
be assessed on the

00:15:22.467 --> 00:15:24.267
basis of some tariff.

00:15:24.267 --> 00:15:30.000
So women may be 2/3 of a man,
a pregnant woman may be one

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.700
and a half times a man,
and so forth.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.800
We saw this in the
Burgundian Code.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.367
Key to the Burgundian Code is
this notion of compensation,

00:15:37.367 --> 00:15:42.433
that money related to the
nature of the loss.

00:15:42.433 --> 00:15:47.067
One finger, two fingers, right
hand, left hand, is

00:15:47.067 --> 00:15:48.033
compensation.

00:15:48.033 --> 00:15:50.700
Bedouin don't have that idea of
compensation, of tariffs,

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.167
of wergild.

00:15:52.167 --> 00:15:55.233
In both the Bedouin and the
German societies, the ruler

00:15:55.233 --> 00:15:58.900
has a limited amount of power.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.967
These are, I wouldn't want to
say democratic societies in

00:16:02.967 --> 00:16:05.400
terms of some theory of
representation, but they're

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:11.100
not societies in which one
person's will is obeyed

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.133
unquestionably.

00:16:12.133 --> 00:16:13.800
They are consultative.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.867
They are more like gangs
in that sense.

00:16:15.867 --> 00:16:21.933
There's a leader, but his
control is conditional on the

00:16:21.933 --> 00:16:25.600
loyalty of his most powerful
subordinates.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.767
And his most powerful
subordinates are quite capable

00:16:27.767 --> 00:16:29.500
of overthrowing him.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.967
The Bedouin sheik is a
little different from

00:16:33.967 --> 00:16:35.600
the Germanic king.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.600
And by Germanic king I mean not
the kings that we've seen

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.900
in the settled post-Roman,
Merovingian empire, but the

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:47.800
kings as described by Tacitus
with possible greater or

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.100
lesser accuracy.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:53.100
In the Germanic tradition,
the king is a war leader.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:58.800
In the Bedouin tradition, the
sheik is an arbiter, a settler

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.100
of disputes.

00:17:04.167 --> 00:17:08.400
Both societies exalted custom,
and both had an exacting

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.633
standard of masculinity.

00:17:12.533 --> 00:17:13.533
The Germans practiced

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:15.900
agriculture and herded animals.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.533
The Bedouins don't have
agriculture, and they

00:17:19.533 --> 00:17:24.933
supplement their herding
of animals by raids

00:17:24.933 --> 00:17:26.600
on wealthier society.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:33.800
These raids, called "razzia,"
are important because the

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.133
Islamic conquests that we're
going to be talking about on

00:17:37.133 --> 00:17:43.033
Wednesday may be said
to begin as raids.

00:17:43.033 --> 00:17:46.967
They begin as raids, and then
they discover that there's

00:17:46.967 --> 00:17:48.267
almost nobody there.

00:17:48.267 --> 00:17:54.133
That the Byzantine army and the
Persian army are crippled

00:17:54.133 --> 00:17:56.400
by fighting against
each other.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.500
So what begins by raids
becomes conquests.

00:18:03.133 --> 00:18:04.367
So we come to Mohammed.

00:18:07.667 --> 00:18:12.233
At first glance it would seem
that Mohammed is a religious

00:18:12.233 --> 00:18:19.167
leader whose career takes place
in what a French scholar

00:18:19.167 --> 00:18:26.867
of religion called "the full
light of history." 620s AD may

00:18:26.867 --> 00:18:31.400
not seem like the full light of
history, but Mohammed as a

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.333
historical figure at least seems
to emerge more clearly

00:18:35.333 --> 00:18:42.200
than Abraham or Moses
or Jesus.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.600
But, as you have read,
Mohammed's biography is

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.533
hopelessly entwined
with legend.

00:18:53.533 --> 00:19:00.633
What we know about Mohammed is
what later Islamic and Arab

00:19:00.633 --> 00:19:04.733
commentators wanted to have
happened to Mohammed.

00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:15.500
There are several sources for
the life of Mohammed, and for

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.200
thus the early years of Islam.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:26.167
There are formal biographies,
called sira, S-I-R-A. The

00:19:26.167 --> 00:19:29.000
problem with these is they
were written long after

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.833
Mohammed's death-- a hundred
years, at least.

00:19:34.833 --> 00:19:39.833
There are collections of oral
tradition, called hadith,

00:19:39.833 --> 00:19:46.367
H-A-D-I-T-H, to which,
similarly, there

00:19:46.367 --> 00:19:49.133
are sayings, proverbs.

00:19:54.833 --> 00:20:00.200
These are also questionable,
because although they were put

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.033
together within fifty years of
Mohammed's death, they're very

00:20:04.033 --> 00:20:08.500
heavily influenced by the first
civil war of the 650s,

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:13.600
which we will be talking about
the day after tomorrow.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:22.767
And then there's the Koran,
which is supposed to represent

00:20:22.767 --> 00:20:34.267
the words of Mohammed as
composed by divine

00:20:34.267 --> 00:20:35.500
inspiration.

00:20:37.767 --> 00:20:41.467
The Koran itself is a text that
scholars outside of the

00:20:41.467 --> 00:20:43.733
Islamic tradition have
questioned in terms of when it

00:20:43.733 --> 00:20:46.833
was put together, how
much by Mohammed,

00:20:46.833 --> 00:20:48.433
how soon after Mohammed.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.433
The problem with all these
sources is not that they are

00:20:57.433 --> 00:21:00.800
unreliable in the sense of
fabrication, but that they

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:07.067
tend to shape events in light
of what the writers already

00:21:07.067 --> 00:21:12.400
know happens and in light of
what they think should happen.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.933
So that, as an example, we'll
be talking about this in a

00:21:16.933 --> 00:21:20.467
moment, but you're all aware
that in 622 Mohammed moves

00:21:20.467 --> 00:21:23.933
suddenly from Mecca to Medina.

00:21:23.933 --> 00:21:29.933
He maybe can be said
to flee Mecca.

00:21:29.933 --> 00:21:35.433
This is called the Hegira, or
Hijra in the Berkey book.

00:21:35.433 --> 00:21:43.100
H-E-G-I-R-A or H-I-J-R-A,
depending on just how faithful

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.667
you think you're being
to the Arab original.

00:21:45.667 --> 00:21:48.733
The Hegira is a key event
in Islamic history.

00:21:48.733 --> 00:21:53.067
It is the point from which
Islamic dating is done.

00:21:53.067 --> 00:21:55.833
That is to say the
Islamic calendar

00:21:55.833 --> 00:21:58.233
starts with the Hegira.

00:21:58.233 --> 00:22:03.000
So this year is the year of
the Hegira such and such.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.633
I can't do 2011 minus 622
immediately, but that's the

00:22:07.633 --> 00:22:08.900
Islamic year.

00:22:12.133 --> 00:22:21.333
According to the traditional
historical record, the Meccans

00:22:21.333 --> 00:22:26.800
tried to assassinate Mohammed,
and he escaped,

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.800
narrowly, this attempt.

00:22:31.867 --> 00:22:35.367
There's no real evidence of this
degree of hostility on

00:22:35.367 --> 00:22:37.967
the part of people in Mecca.

00:22:37.967 --> 00:22:40.667
There's no evidence of an
assassination attempt, or at

00:22:40.667 --> 00:22:42.300
least independent evidence.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.067
And the assassination attempt
seems to be something that is

00:22:46.067 --> 00:22:51.133
important for the story, for
the way that the story is

00:22:51.133 --> 00:22:56.667
presented later, to dramatize
something that may not have

00:22:56.667 --> 00:23:00.233
been at the time as dramatic
as it seemed.

00:23:00.233 --> 00:23:02.533
It may have been that the
Meccans simply didn't listen

00:23:02.533 --> 00:23:04.300
to Mohammed and then
he accepted an

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.700
invitation to Medina.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:09.733
It may be that they were trying
to sort of shut his

00:23:09.733 --> 00:23:12.167
movement down.

00:23:12.167 --> 00:23:15.333
But that they resorted to
assassination does not seem to

00:23:15.333 --> 00:23:16.600
be very likely.

00:23:19.133 --> 00:23:22.733
OK, so having given you all of
these fatiguing caveats about

00:23:22.733 --> 00:23:27.167
what we do and do not know,
let's say Mohammed was born

00:23:27.167 --> 00:23:29.467
between 570 and 580.

00:23:29.467 --> 00:23:34.600
He was born into a reasonably
prominent but not really very

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.900
affluent family of Mecca.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:42.233
He may have been a merchant.

00:23:42.233 --> 00:23:46.467
It is usually assumed he was,
and this is partly because the

00:23:46.467 --> 00:23:51.133
Koran has a lot of mercantile
similes.

00:23:51.133 --> 00:23:57.000
In order to elucidate various
points, comparison is made

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.833
with trade, but there's
no real evidence.

00:24:01.833 --> 00:24:04.233
We don't really know what
he did for a living.

00:24:04.233 --> 00:24:06.867
We know that he married well.

00:24:06.867 --> 00:24:15.067
His first wife, Khadija,
K-H-A-D-I-J-A, was from a

00:24:15.067 --> 00:24:21.067
wealthy family, a higher class
family than Mohammed's own.

00:24:21.067 --> 00:24:25.500
And we also know that Mohammed
got his start as a religious

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:31.567
thinker, as a prophet, at the
age of forty, an encouragement

00:24:31.567 --> 00:24:34.300
to those of us who are
slow to get our

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.033
careers off the ground.

00:24:39.833 --> 00:24:42.733
The discouraging part is that
his career only lasts a

00:24:42.733 --> 00:24:44.333
relatively brief time.

00:24:44.333 --> 00:24:47.900
He dies ten years after the
Hegira, but he does accomplish

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.367
an awful lot.

00:24:50.367 --> 00:24:53.467
What was his religious
experience?

00:24:53.467 --> 00:24:58.267
What was the revelation
vouchsafed to him that he

00:24:58.267 --> 00:25:02.567
preached to the citizens
of Mecca beginning

00:25:02.567 --> 00:25:10.667
around 615 to 620?

00:25:10.667 --> 00:25:15.467
It is certainly a message of
monotheism against what was

00:25:15.467 --> 00:25:20.833
considered to be a prevailing
paganism, or polytheism on the

00:25:20.833 --> 00:25:27.533
part of the merchants and
tribesmen of Arabia.

00:25:27.533 --> 00:25:30.767
But as we've said, Arabia
had lots of Jews and

00:25:30.767 --> 00:25:32.467
Christians as well.

00:25:32.467 --> 00:25:35.733
And it's a little tricky to tell
how much Mohammed would

00:25:35.733 --> 00:25:39.100
have known about Judaism
and Christianity.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.033
But it looks as if he did.

00:25:41.033 --> 00:25:48.100
And indeed, it looks as if his
preaching begins as a kind of

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.167
biblical monotheism
for the Arabs.

00:25:51.167 --> 00:25:56.300
It is a message to the Arabs
congruent with the message of

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.400
Judaism and Christianity, the
message of Judaism and

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:05.600
Christianity being understood as
a statement of the unity of

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:11.100
God and a progressive
interpretation of God's

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:15.733
message by a series of prophets,
a series of prophets

00:26:15.733 --> 00:26:26.700
beginning with Abraham,
including Moses, Isaiah,

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:32.033
Jesus, according to Islam,
and Mohammed.

00:26:32.033 --> 00:26:37.833
Mohammed is then in the
line of prophets.

00:26:37.833 --> 00:26:42.267
The degree to which this means
that Islam takes on its own

00:26:42.267 --> 00:26:45.067
identity is hard to say.

00:26:45.067 --> 00:26:49.000
And the tendency of scholars
outside of the Islamic

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.033
tradition, that is people like
Berkey, is to say it takes

00:26:52.033 --> 00:26:53.433
quite a while.

00:26:53.433 --> 00:26:56.267
Takes quite a while for there
to be the confidence that

00:26:56.267 --> 00:26:59.900
Islam is a religion that is
different from Judaism and

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.933
Christianity, while it is clear
from the start that the

00:27:03.933 --> 00:27:08.933
people who are embracing it
are different, even though

00:27:08.933 --> 00:27:12.300
there are Arab and Jewish
Christians, and we'll see what

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.500
that means in a moment.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:19.500
Mohammed's first converts are
his family circle and a group

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.500
of key friends.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.300
And they're all important
historically.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:31.433
His wife, his cousin Ali, who
would marry his daughter

00:27:31.433 --> 00:27:47.033
Fatima, a merchant named Abu
Bakr, a powerful member of one

00:27:47.033 --> 00:27:53.167
of the leading clans or family
groups of Mecca, Uthman,

00:27:53.167 --> 00:27:54.133
sometimes spelled--

00:27:54.133 --> 00:27:57.500
I think in the Berkey book
spelled with a U, so we'll use

00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:58.900
the U.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:03.267
Uthman, right, Ali, I've
mentioned, Abu Bakr.

00:28:09.333 --> 00:28:12.233
Uthman is a member of
the Umayyad family.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.400
And Omar.

00:28:24.633 --> 00:28:28.933
These are sort of considered
to be the inner circle of

00:28:28.933 --> 00:28:30.167
very, very early converts.

00:28:33.667 --> 00:28:36.233
As I said, according to
tradition the ruling circles

00:28:36.233 --> 00:28:40.900
of Mecca became fearful as
what had been a fringe

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:45.467
movement started to gain
more converts.

00:28:45.467 --> 00:28:52.000
The people who ruled Mecca
feared that their control was

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.167
slipping from their grasp, and
they feared that this new

00:28:55.167 --> 00:28:58.967
movement was popular
with a lower class.

00:28:58.967 --> 00:29:04.300
The leading clan of Mecca
were the Quraish.

00:29:06.867 --> 00:29:11.067
These are the people who are
most powerful in Mecca and

00:29:11.067 --> 00:29:15.600
begin as the enemies of Mohammed
and are responsible

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:20.133
for driving him out, if indeed
he was driven out.

00:29:20.133 --> 00:29:27.067
In 622 the city of Medina,
another merchant center,

00:29:27.067 --> 00:29:36.067
invited Mohammed to come as a
kind of arbiter or ruler who

00:29:36.067 --> 00:29:38.700
was above factions and who
could then settle their

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.000
internecine disputes.

00:29:42.933 --> 00:29:43.167
This is not an uncommon
pattern.

00:29:43.167 --> 00:29:45.000
You'll see it in late
medieval and

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.533
Renaissance Italy, in fact.

00:29:46.533 --> 00:29:54.533
The podesta in Italian cities
is an outsider who is

00:29:54.533 --> 00:30:00.467
empowered with very extensive
police powers to quell feuds.

00:30:00.467 --> 00:30:03.100
In Romeo and Juliet, for
example, there's a podesta,

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:07.367
but he's not able to
solve the feud.

00:30:07.367 --> 00:30:12.500
But that's the kind of scene
that we can imagine as the

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.900
western equivalent of Medina.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:20.833
Muhammad is invited as a wise
man, as an arbiter, as a

00:30:20.833 --> 00:30:24.600
reconciler to the city
of Medina, an

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.833
offer that he accepts.

00:30:28.433 --> 00:30:33.100
And it is in Medina that we
really start to see emerge

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.900
what can be called an
Islamic identity.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:41.900
I tend to think a little bit
earlier than Berkey, because

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:46.133
here Islam starts to
differentiate itself from

00:30:46.133 --> 00:30:47.733
Judaism and Christianity.

00:30:47.733 --> 00:30:52.933
And indeed, the period at Medina
culminates with the

00:30:52.933 --> 00:30:57.433
expulsion of Jewish groups who
refuse to accept Mohammed.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:05.167
What he does at Medina also is
to preach that the religious

00:31:05.167 --> 00:31:10.167
loyalty is more important than
loyalty to the tribal group.

00:31:10.167 --> 00:31:14.967
The religious loyalty therefore
is not simply a

00:31:14.967 --> 00:31:20.267
accompaniment to your already
existing identity; it is the

00:31:20.267 --> 00:31:22.233
most important aspect
of your identity.

00:31:26.567 --> 00:31:31.933
It's at Medina that Mecca
replaces Jerusalem as the

00:31:31.933 --> 00:31:35.533
point of orientation
for prayer.

00:31:35.533 --> 00:31:42.267
It's at Medina that Mohammed
stopped celebrating Yom Kippur

00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:48.633
and institutes a month-long
fast during the daylight

00:31:48.633 --> 00:31:50.033
hours, Ramadan.

00:31:52.533 --> 00:31:56.733
At Medina, Friday becomes
the Sabbath,

00:31:56.733 --> 00:31:59.000
not Saturday or Sunday.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.100
And the Jews are expelled
from Medina.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:09.333
And by Jews I don't mean some
kind of foreign community of

00:32:09.333 --> 00:32:12.967
non-Arabs who happen to be
living in Medina, but rather

00:32:12.967 --> 00:32:15.833
Jews, some of whom came
from elsewhere, many

00:32:15.833 --> 00:32:17.100
of whom were Arabs.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:25.433
And it's also here that Mohammed
perfects this notion

00:32:25.433 --> 00:32:29.133
as against the Christians and
Jews who have scorned him that

00:32:29.133 --> 00:32:32.633
he is the Seal of the Prophets,

00:32:32.633 --> 00:32:34.333
the last of the prophets.

00:32:40.433 --> 00:32:43.233
From Abraham to Jesus,
now to Mohammad.

00:32:43.233 --> 00:32:44.933
This is the last prophecy.

00:32:44.933 --> 00:32:50.467
God's message has not been
packaged into one deal, one

00:32:50.467 --> 00:32:54.367
file too large for one
email attachment.

00:32:54.367 --> 00:32:57.967
And it's come in a bunch of
them, and this is it.

00:32:57.967 --> 00:33:02.233
Here are all the cute cat
pictures and all of the--

00:33:02.233 --> 00:33:05.567
whole file, which you now can
download in segments.

00:33:05.567 --> 00:33:06.667
But it's over.

00:33:06.667 --> 00:33:08.333
This is it.

00:33:08.333 --> 00:33:12.767
The Jews and Christians are
wrong to think that either it

00:33:12.767 --> 00:33:18.067
ended with Elijah or that the
be all and end all of all

00:33:18.067 --> 00:33:20.133
prophecy was Jesus.

00:33:20.133 --> 00:33:22.200
No.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:22.767
No.

00:33:22.767 --> 00:33:25.200
This is the truth.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:31.000
But keep in mind that Islam did,
and at least is supposed

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.967
to, respect Judaism and
Christianity as not merely

00:33:34.967 --> 00:33:39.000
precursors, but as part
of the same tradition.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.233
"People of the Book" is the term
often used in Islam to

00:33:43.233 --> 00:33:45.633
describe Judaism and
Christianity.

00:33:45.633 --> 00:33:51.700
They share the same, if not
scripture exactly, but the

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:57.300
same kind of historical
religious orientation.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.800
The criticism that Islam can
make against Christianity is

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.067
that it tends to be
polytheistic.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:09.467
And as you know, Islam expands
great care to make sure that

00:34:09.467 --> 00:34:11.767
the human form does
not appear in art.

00:34:11.767 --> 00:34:13.733
And in some forms of Islamic
art that not

00:34:13.733 --> 00:34:16.367
even animals appear.

00:34:16.367 --> 00:34:19.433
Depiction of the human
figure is proscribed.

00:34:19.433 --> 00:34:23.633
Great care is made in
differentiating Mohammed from

00:34:23.633 --> 00:34:28.000
what Muslims see as the
exaggerated stature of Jesus.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.667
Mohammed is a prophet.

00:34:30.667 --> 00:34:35.433
He is a messenger of Allah,
not to be identified with

00:34:35.433 --> 00:34:36.667
Allah himself.

00:34:36.667 --> 00:34:38.833
There is no depiction
of Mohammed.

00:34:38.833 --> 00:34:41.900
People do not have pictures
of him in their houses.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.767
There are no statues to him.

00:34:49.433 --> 00:34:52.667
Mohammed's greatest challenge
was to overcome these tribal

00:34:52.667 --> 00:34:57.067
loyalties in favor of the umma,
U-M-M-A, the community

00:34:57.067 --> 00:34:58.333
of the faithful.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:06.000
He allowed property and marriage
to be decided still

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.200
by tribal tradition, but
prohibited feuds and required

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:16.367
that disputes be arbitrated
in religious courts.

00:35:16.367 --> 00:35:17.233
This is important.

00:35:17.233 --> 00:35:21.700
Because Mohammed, like the
rabbis of the Diaspora in

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:26.200
Judaism, is both a religious
leader and a judge.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.933
He is a community leader
and a spiritual leader.

00:35:29.933 --> 00:35:34.733
And indeed, these two things are
not really distinguished.

00:35:34.733 --> 00:35:37.133
I emphasize this because it's
really different from

00:35:37.133 --> 00:35:38.733
Christianity.

00:35:38.733 --> 00:35:43.633
In Christianity, there's a
church and there's a legal,

00:35:43.633 --> 00:35:45.900
secular state.

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.667
Sometimes, and of course the
Middle Ages to some extent

00:35:48.667 --> 00:35:51.933
defined by this, the Church
will have what look like

00:35:51.933 --> 00:35:53.000
secular powers.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.533
We've talked about this with
regard to the bishops and

00:35:55.533 --> 00:35:57.833
Gregory of Tours.

00:35:57.833 --> 00:36:02.000
At times the papacy, later,
would claim all sorts of

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.100
political powers.

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:06.333
But conceptually in
Christianity, because

00:36:06.333 --> 00:36:10.767
Christianity was an illegal
religious brotherhood within

00:36:10.767 --> 00:36:16.533
the Roman Empire for over two
centuries, church and state

00:36:16.533 --> 00:36:17.800
are different.

00:36:19.833 --> 00:36:24.833
In Islam, one can't really talk
about church or clergy.

00:36:24.833 --> 00:36:30.367
There are religious leaders who
have political authority,

00:36:30.367 --> 00:36:34.500
but their authority is what we
would call that of a judge and

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.400
that of a religious leader
at the same time.

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.900
The political order
and the religious

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.067
community are the same.

00:36:44.067 --> 00:36:47.600
That's why when we talk about
the Arab conquest or the

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.467
Islamic conquest, we're talking
about something in

00:36:50.467 --> 00:36:56.200
which the new territories are
taken over by a state that's

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.933
not a theocracy in the sense
of the church's ruling the

00:36:59.933 --> 00:37:02.667
state, but something in which
the church and state are not

00:37:02.667 --> 00:37:03.900
to be distinguished.

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:10.033
We'll talk about this more when
we come to the conquests.

00:37:10.033 --> 00:37:14.833
Within two years of the
Hegira, 622, so by 624

00:37:14.833 --> 00:37:20.067
Mohammed was planning to take
over Mecca, to re-enter in

00:37:20.067 --> 00:37:23.433
triumph the city that he had
fled, if not under cover of

00:37:23.433 --> 00:37:26.100
darkness at least under
murky circumstances.

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:34.067
A victory in battle in 624 gave
Mohammed the confidence

00:37:34.067 --> 00:37:39.800
to expel Jews and Christians
from Medina and to take on

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.800
this title of Seal
of the Prophets.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:49.800
And by 627 Medina gained the
upper hand, and in 630 Mecca

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.000
fell to Mohammed
and his forces.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.567
And all of the tribes of Mecca
and of the surrounding areas

00:37:57.567 --> 00:38:00.300
submitted to Mohammed.

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:04.567
They recognized him as
a political as well

00:38:04.567 --> 00:38:05.933
as religious leader.

00:38:05.933 --> 00:38:10.233
Again, the two things not easily
to be distinguished.

00:38:10.233 --> 00:38:12.633
And then Mohammed died.

00:38:12.633 --> 00:38:18.200
In 632 he died, and what is
remarkable is that the

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.733
momentum he established was able
to survive his demise.

00:38:21.733 --> 00:38:25.067
Because most of the tribes
probably thought that their

00:38:25.067 --> 00:38:28.700
loyalty was to him as a prophet
and a person, and not

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:32.500
to some sort of institution that
would survive his death.

00:38:37.533 --> 00:38:41.033
And indeed, his death would
usher in a period of

00:38:41.033 --> 00:38:42.800
incredibly rapid expansion.

00:38:46.333 --> 00:38:49.000
Within a few years of Mohammed's
death, Damascus,

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.233
the great city of the eastern
Mediterranean, Byzantine

00:38:52.233 --> 00:38:56.133
Damascus, would fall to the
Arabs, the first of many such

00:38:56.133 --> 00:39:00.733
conquests that we will be
marching through on Wednesday.

00:39:03.233 --> 00:39:08.133
But this question of religious
loyalty would be exacerbated

00:39:08.133 --> 00:39:11.367
by splits within Islam, which
we'll also be describing.

00:39:14.667 --> 00:39:21.367
The tenets of Islam, just to
close by way of our last

00:39:21.367 --> 00:39:25.900
remarks for the day Islam means
"surrender." And to

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.400
surrender oneself to the power
of Allah is the beginning of

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.100
wisdom, beginning of faith.

00:39:34.133 --> 00:39:38.100
Acknowledgement of Allah is
acknowledgement a strict

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:43.400
monotheism, acknowledgement of
Mohammed as the messenger

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:48.933
prophet of Allah, and
as the last prophet.

00:39:48.933 --> 00:39:55.133
The so-called "five pillars of
Islam" are duties incumbent on

00:39:55.133 --> 00:39:57.667
the believer.

00:39:57.667 --> 00:40:00.767
And these are the confession
of faith that I just

00:40:00.767 --> 00:40:09.167
mentioned, daily prayers, five
times a day, the giving of

00:40:09.167 --> 00:40:18.533
alms, the observance of Ramadan,
and the performance

00:40:18.533 --> 00:40:23.000
of the pilgrimage to Mecca
if that's possible.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.133
What's not there is
interesting, too.

00:40:27.133 --> 00:40:34.433
What's not intrinsic to Islam
is a strong sense of sin.

00:40:34.433 --> 00:40:38.933
The Arabs do not like the
Confessions of Saint

00:40:38.933 --> 00:40:42.967
Augustine, are not interested
in this particular form of

00:40:42.967 --> 00:40:44.200
spiritual investigation.

00:40:49.233 --> 00:40:52.700
The believer can pray
directly to Allah.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:56.533
There is really no Islamic
clergy in the sense of

00:40:56.533 --> 00:40:59.667
presiding over sacraments
or channels of grace.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:07.567
The mosque is a gathering
place.

00:41:07.567 --> 00:41:13.933
it is not a place that has some
kind of powerful holy

00:41:13.933 --> 00:41:17.900
objects in it, in the sense
that a church in this era

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:23.000
would have relics or Eucharistic
hosts and other

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.967
very powerful, sacred things.

00:41:28.867 --> 00:41:33.567
Islam is a religion of conduct
and law, not of mortification

00:41:33.567 --> 00:41:36.033
and purgation.

00:41:36.033 --> 00:41:39.433
It emphasizes upright behavior:
no drinking, no

00:41:39.433 --> 00:41:42.433
gambling, certain dietary
restrictions.

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:45.700
Not the renunciation of the
world-- it does not say, "Sell

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.933
everything you have and give
it to the poor." It says,

00:41:47.933 --> 00:41:49.400
"Give alms."

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:52.233
It is a moderate religion,
actually.

00:41:52.233 --> 00:41:56.933
It is a "do-able" religion.

00:41:56.933 --> 00:42:02.233
These obligations may be
somewhat inconvenient at

00:42:02.233 --> 00:42:07.267
times, Ramadan for example, but
there is nothing in here

00:42:07.267 --> 00:42:10.100
to the degree that the New
Testament, for example,

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.167
prescribes behavior that
most people are

00:42:12.167 --> 00:42:13.333
not going to follow.

00:42:15.567 --> 00:42:19.567
Or that traditional
Judaism, possible

00:42:19.567 --> 00:42:21.933
but certainly onerous.

00:42:21.933 --> 00:42:23.167
Lots of obligations.

00:42:27.767 --> 00:42:30.967
The other difference, more
important, with Judaism is

00:42:30.967 --> 00:42:36.667
that Islam would be very
quickly universal.

00:42:36.667 --> 00:42:40.933
In other words, it would
encourage conversion, although

00:42:40.933 --> 00:42:47.033
not, as we will see, with
great enthusiasm.

00:42:47.033 --> 00:42:50.367
It is completely erroneous to
think that these armies that

00:42:50.367 --> 00:42:53.533
burst forth from Arabia after
the death of Mohammed were

00:42:53.533 --> 00:42:56.933
intent of getting everybody
to follow Mohammed.

00:42:56.933 --> 00:43:01.100
They were intent on conquest,
all right.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.800
But we'll see that their goals
were a little more complicated

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:08.900
than that of orienting everybody
towards this new

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:10.967
faith, whatever we're
going to call it.

00:43:10.967 --> 00:43:13.267
And we'll see more about that
the day after tomorrow.

00:43:13.267 --> 00:43:14.500
Thanks.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.620
Prof: Last time we
introduced the way in which the

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.005
preoccupation with literary and
other forms of theory in the

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:17.390
twentieth century is shadowed by
a certain skepticism,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.969
but as we were talking about
that we actually introduced

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:24.548
another issue which isn't quite
the same as the issue of

00:00:24.548 --> 00:00:27.570
skepticism--
namely, determinism.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.062
In other words,
we said that in intellectual

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:32.648
history,
first you get this movement of

00:00:32.648 --> 00:00:36.220
concern about the distance
between the perceiver and the

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.339
perceived,
a concern that gives rise to

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:44.390
skepticism about whether we can
know things as they really are.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.808
But then as a kind of aftermath
of that movement in figures like

00:00:51.808 --> 00:00:54.280
Marx,
Nietzsche and Freud--and you'll

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.244
notice that Foucault reverts to
such figures when he turns to

00:00:57.244 --> 00:00:59.120
the whole question of
"founders of

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.590
discursivity,"
we'll come back to that--

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.623
in figures like that,
you get the further question of

00:01:05.623 --> 00:01:10.510
not just how we can know things
in themselves as they really are

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.623
but how we can trust the
autonomy of that which knows:

00:01:14.623 --> 00:01:18.599
in other words,
how we can trust the autonomy

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:22.280
of consciousness if in fact
there's a chance--

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.319
a good chance,
according to these writers--

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.849
that it is in turn governed by,
controlled by,

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:32.019
hidden powers or forces.
 

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:37.792
This question of determinism is
as important in the discourse of

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:42.190
literary theory as the question
of skepticism.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.941
They're plainly interrelated in
a variety of ways,

00:01:45.941 --> 00:01:50.534
but it's more to the question
of determinism I want to return

00:01:50.534 --> 00:01:51.300
today.
 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.958
Now last time,
following Ricoeur,

00:01:55.958 --> 00:02:00.789
I mentioned Marx,
Nietzsche and Freud as key

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.921
figures in the sort of secondary
development that somehow

00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:08.628
inaugurates theory,
and then I added Darwin.

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:13.482
It seems particularly important
to think of Darwin when we begin

00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:18.180
to think about the ways in which
in the twentieth century,

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.400
a variety of thinkers are
concerned about human agency--

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.679
that is to say,
what becomes of the idea that

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:30.397
we have autonomy,
that we can act or at least

00:02:30.397 --> 00:02:35.349
that we can act with a sense of
integrity and not just with a

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.550
sense that we are being pulled
by our strings like a puppet.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.970
In the aftermath of Darwin in
particular,

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.169
our understanding of natural
selection,

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:50.330
our understanding of genetic
hard-wiring and other factors,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.593
makes us begin to wonder in
what sense we can consider

00:02:54.593 --> 00:02:58.300
ourselves,
each of us, to be autonomous

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.250
subjects.
 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.348
And so, as I say,
the question of agency arises.

00:03:04.348 --> 00:03:06.908
It's in that context,
needless to say,

00:03:06.908 --> 00:03:11.049
that I'd like to take a look at
these two interesting passages

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.848
on the sheet that has Anton
Chekhov on one side and Henry

00:03:14.848 --> 00:03:16.409
James on the other.
 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:17.780
Let's begin with the Chekhov.
 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.180
The Cherry Orchard,
you know,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.120
is about the threat owing to
socioeconomic conditions,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.742
the conditions that do
ultimately lead to the Menshevik

00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:32.276
Revolution of 1905,
to a landed estate,

00:03:32.276 --> 00:03:38.119
and the perturbation and
turmoil into which the cast of

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:42.340
characters is thrown by this
threat.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.470
Now one of the more interesting
characters,

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.800
who is not really a protagonist
in the play for class reasons,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.300
is a house servant named
Yepihodov,

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.240
and Yepihodov is a character
who is,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.460
among other things,
a kind of autodidact.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.493
That is to say,
he has scrambled into a certain

00:04:00.493 --> 00:04:02.870
measure of knowledge about
things.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.740
He is full of a kind of
understandable self-pity,

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.121
and his speeches are in some
ways more characteristic of the

00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:17.682
gloomy intellectual
milieu that is reflected

00:04:17.682 --> 00:04:22.699
in Chekhov's text really than
almost anyone else's.

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:25.920
I want to quote to you a couple
of them.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.331
Toward the bottom of the first
page, he says,

00:04:29.331 --> 00:04:31.579
"I'm a cultivated man.
 

00:04:31.579 --> 00:04:36.136
I read all kinds of remarkable
books and yet I can never make

00:04:36.136 --> 00:04:38.870
out what direction I should
take,

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.389
what it is that I want,
properly speaking."

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.901
As I read, pay attention to the
degree to which he's constantly

00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:51.413
talking about language and about
the way in which he himself is

00:04:51.413 --> 00:04:53.379
inserted into language.
 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:57.199
He's perpetually seeking a mode
of properly speaking.

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:04.000
He is a person who is somewhat
knowledgeable about books,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.901
feels himself somehow to be
caught up in the matrix of book

00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:09.867
learning--
in other words,

00:05:09.867 --> 00:05:13.341
a person who is very much
preoccupied with his

00:05:13.341 --> 00:05:17.565
conditioning by language,
not least when perhaps

00:05:17.565 --> 00:05:21.269
unwittingly he alludes to
Hamlet.

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:25.103
"Should I live or should I
shoot myself?"--properly

00:05:25.103 --> 00:05:27.850
speaking, "To be or not to
be?"

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.449
In other words,
he inserts himself into the

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:36.935
dramatic tradition to which as a
character he himself belongs and

00:05:36.935 --> 00:05:42.250
shows himself to be in a debased
form derived from one of those

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.478
famous charismatic moments in
which a hero utters a comparable

00:05:47.478 --> 00:05:48.850
concern.
 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.362
So in all sorts of ways,
in this simple passage we find

00:05:53.362 --> 00:05:58.459
a character who's caught up in
the snare--if I can put it that

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:01.050
way--the snare of language.
 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.752
To continue,
he says at the top of the next

00:06:06.752 --> 00:06:09.603
page,
"Properly speaking and

00:06:09.603 --> 00:06:14.680
letting other subjects alone,
I must say"--everything in

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.291
terms of what other discourse
does and what he himself can

00:06:20.291 --> 00:06:21.536
say,
and of course,

00:06:21.536 --> 00:06:22.680
it's mainly about
"me"--

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.990
"regarding myself among
other things,

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.305
that fate treats me mercilessly
as a storm treats a small

00:06:31.305 --> 00:06:32.540
boat."
 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.766
And the end of the passage is,
"Have you read

00:06:34.766 --> 00:06:35.449
Buckle?"
 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:39.500
Now Buckle is a forgotten name
today, but at one time he was

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.278
just about as famous as Oswald
Spengler who wrote The

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:47.675
Decline of the West.
He was a Victorian historian

00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:52.660
preoccupied with the dissolution
of Western civilization.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.175
In other words,
Buckle was the avatar of the

00:06:55.175 --> 00:06:58.451
notion in the late nineteenth
century that everything was

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:00.439
going to hell in a handbasket.
 

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:06.180
One of the texts that Yepihodov
has read that in a certain sense

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.639
determines him is Buckle.
 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:10.220
"Have you read Buckle?
 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:16.300
I wish to have a word with you
Avdotya Fyodorovna."

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.444
In other words,
I'm arguing that the saturation

00:07:20.444 --> 00:07:24.139
of these speeches with signs of
words,

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:27.601
language, speaking,
words, books,

00:07:27.601 --> 00:07:31.819
is just the dilemma of the
character.

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:35.045
That is to say,
he is in a certain sense book-

00:07:35.045 --> 00:07:39.668
and language-determined,
and he's obscurely aware that

00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:45.230
this is his problem even as it's
a source of pride for him.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.286
Turning then to a passage in a
very different tone from James's

00:07:49.286 --> 00:07:50.399
Ambassadors.
 

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:52.230
An altogether charming
character,

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.440
the elderly Lambert Strether,
who has gone to--

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:01.064
most of you know--has gone to
Paris to bring home the young

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:04.105
Chad Newsome,
a relative who is to take over

00:08:04.105 --> 00:08:07.880
the family business,
the manufacture of an unnamed

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.482
household article in Woollett,
Massachusetts,

00:08:11.482 --> 00:08:12.899
probably toilet paper.
 

00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:15.716
In any case,
Lambert Strether,

00:08:15.716 --> 00:08:20.382
as he arrives in Paris,
has awakened to the sheer

00:08:20.382 --> 00:08:23.199
wonder of urbane culture.
 

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:26.569
He recognizes that he's missed
something.

00:08:26.569 --> 00:08:30.120
He's gone to a party given by a
sculptor,

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.332
and at this party he meets a
young man named Little Bilham

00:08:34.332 --> 00:08:37.277
whom he likes,
and he takes Little Bilham

00:08:37.277 --> 00:08:41.614
aside by the lapel,
and he makes a long speech to

00:08:41.614 --> 00:08:45.090
him, saying,
"Don't do what I have done.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.460
Don't miss out on life.
 

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.440
Live all you can.
 

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.149
It is a mistake not to.
 

00:08:52.149 --> 00:08:55.210
And this is why,"
he goes on to say,

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.662
"the affair,
I mean the affair of

00:08:57.662 --> 00:08:59.620
life"--
it's as though he's

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.090
anticipating the affair of Chad
Newsome and Madame de Vionnet,

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.899
which is revealed at the end of
the text--

00:09:04.899 --> 00:09:10.109
"couldn't,
no doubt, have been different

00:09:10.109 --> 00:09:14.220
for me for it's"--
"it" meaning life--

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.243
"[life is]
at the best a tin mold either

00:09:18.243 --> 00:09:23.182
fluted or embossed with
ornamental excrescences or else

00:09:23.182 --> 00:09:29.246
smooth and dreadfully plain,
into which, a helpless jelly,

00:09:29.246 --> 00:09:35.696
one's consciousness,
is poured so that one takes the

00:09:35.696 --> 00:09:38.090
form,
as the great cook says"--

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:39.514
the great cook,
by the way, is

00:09:39.514 --> 00:09:41.884
Brillat-Savarin--
"one takes the form,

00:09:41.884 --> 00:09:45.979
as the great cook says,
and is more or less compactly

00:09:45.979 --> 00:09:47.080
held by it.
 

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.798
One lives, in fine, as one can.
 

00:09:50.798 --> 00:09:55.379
Still one has the illusion of
freedom."

00:09:55.379 --> 00:09:58.686
Here is where Strether says
something very clever that I

00:09:58.686 --> 00:10:00.308
think we can make use of.
 

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:04.951
He says, "Therefore,
don't be like me without the

00:10:04.951 --> 00:10:07.230
memory of that illusion.
 

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:13.628
I was either at the right time
too stupid or too intelligent to

00:10:13.628 --> 00:10:14.659
have it.
 

00:10:14.659 --> 00:10:17.940
I don't quite know which."
 

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.336
Now if he was too stupid to
have it, then of course he would

00:10:22.336 --> 00:10:25.840
have been liberated into the
realm of action.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.538
He would have been what
Nietzsche in an interesting

00:10:28.538 --> 00:10:31.240
precursor text calls
"historical man."

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:36.456
He simply would have plunged
ahead into life as though he had

00:10:36.456 --> 00:10:41.847
freedom, even though he was too
stupid to recognize that it was

00:10:41.847 --> 00:10:43.240
an illusion.
 

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.558
On the other hand,
if he was too intelligent to,

00:10:48.558 --> 00:10:54.090
as it were, bury the illusion
and live as though he were free,

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.500
if he was too intelligent to do
that,

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.830
he's a kind of an avatar of the
literary theorist--

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:03.546
in other words,
the sort of person who can't

00:11:03.546 --> 00:11:08.818
forget long enough that freedom
is an illusion in order to get

00:11:08.818 --> 00:11:12.190
away from the preoccupations
that,

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.375
as I've been saying,
characterize a certain kind of

00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:17.668
thinking in the twentieth
century.

00:11:17.668 --> 00:11:21.945
And it's rather charming at the
last that he says--because how

00:11:21.945 --> 00:11:26.220
can we know anything--"I
don't quite know which."

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:31.397
That, too, strikes me as a
helpful and also characteristic

00:11:31.397 --> 00:11:36.120
passage that can introduce us to
today's subject,

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.480
which is the loss of authority:
that is to say,

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.022
in Roland Barthes' terms,
"the death of the

00:11:42.022 --> 00:11:44.240
author,"
and in Foucault's terms,

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.480
the question "What is an
author?"

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.926
In other words,
in the absence of human agency,

00:11:51.926 --> 00:11:57.048
the first sacrifice for
literary theory is the author,

00:11:57.048 --> 00:11:59.658
the idea of the author.
 

00:11:59.658 --> 00:12:04.269
That's what will concern us in
this second, still introductory

00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:06.158
lecture to this course.
 

00:12:06.158 --> 00:12:10.581
We'll get into the proper or at
least more systematic business

00:12:10.581 --> 00:12:14.570
of the course when we turn to
hermeneutics next week.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:18.000
Now let me set the scene.
 

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.370
This is Paris.
 

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:20.808
It wouldn't have to be Paris.
 

00:12:20.808 --> 00:12:23.470
It could be Berkeley or
Columbia or maybe Berlin.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:28.916
It's 1968 or '69,
spilling over in to the

00:12:28.916 --> 00:12:30.548
seventies.
 

00:12:30.548 --> 00:12:33.878
Students and most of their
professors are on the

00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:37.280
barricades,
that is to say in protest not

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:42.269
only against the war in Vietnam
but the outpouring of various

00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:46.261
forms of authoritative
resistance to protest that

00:12:46.261 --> 00:12:48.840
characterized the sixties.
 

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:54.073
There is a ferment of
intellectual revolt which takes

00:12:54.073 --> 00:13:00.113
all sorts of forms in Paris but
is first and foremost perhaps

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:05.749
organized by what quickly in
this country became a bumper

00:13:05.749 --> 00:13:10.379
sticker: "Question
authority."

00:13:10.379 --> 00:13:16.403
This is the framework in which
the then most prominent

00:13:16.403 --> 00:13:23.339
intellectual in France writes an
essay at the very peak of the

00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:27.274
student uprising,
entitled "What is an

00:13:27.274 --> 00:13:28.080
Author?"
 

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.660
and poses an answer which is by
no means straightforward and

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:33.360
simple.
 

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.720
You're probably a little
frustrated because maybe you

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.899
sort of anticipated what he was
going to say,

00:13:37.899 --> 00:13:39.889
and then you read it and you
said, "Gee,

00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:41.399
he really isn't saying that.
 

00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:44.331
In fact, I don't quite know
what he is saying"

00:13:44.331 --> 00:13:47.437
and struggled more than you're
expected to because you

00:13:47.437 --> 00:13:50.898
anticipated what I've just been
saying about the setting and

00:13:50.898 --> 00:13:54.240
about the role of Foucault and
all the rest of it,

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.283
and were possibly more confused
than you might have expected to

00:13:58.283 --> 00:13:58.610
be.
 

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.620
Yet at the same time,
you probably thought "Oh,

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.544
yeah, well, I did come out
pretty much in the place I

00:14:04.544 --> 00:14:07.865
expected to come out in despite
the roundabout way of having

00:14:07.865 --> 00:14:09.158
gotten there."
 

00:14:09.158 --> 00:14:11.576
Because this lecture is
introductory,

00:14:11.576 --> 00:14:15.471
I'm not going to spend a great
deal of time explicating the

00:14:15.471 --> 00:14:18.360
more difficult moments in his
argument.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.590
I am going to emphasize what
you perhaps did anticipate that

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.315
he would say,
so that can take us along

00:14:25.315 --> 00:14:26.750
rather smoothly.
 

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:28.610
There is an initial issue.
 

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:33.032
Because we're as skeptical
about skepticism as we are about

00:14:33.032 --> 00:14:37.302
anything else we're likely to
raise our eyebrows and say,

00:14:37.302 --> 00:14:38.370
"Hmm.
 

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.470
Doesn't this guy Foucault think
he's an author?

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:44.629
You know, after all,
he's a superstar.

00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:48.928
He's used to being taken very
seriously.

00:14:48.928 --> 00:14:52.798
Does he want to say that he's
just an author function,

00:14:52.798 --> 00:14:56.846
that his textual field is a
kind of set of structural

00:14:56.846 --> 00:15:00.970
operations within which one can
discover an author?

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.870
Does he really want to say
this?"

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:06.164
Well, this is the question
raised by the skeptic about

00:15:06.164 --> 00:15:09.770
skepticism or about theory and
it's one that we're going to

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.836
take rather seriously,
but we're going to come back to

00:15:12.836 --> 00:15:15.038
it because there are ways,
it seems to me,

00:15:15.038 --> 00:15:17.700
of keeping this question at
arm's length.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.961
In other words,
Foucault is up to something

00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:22.831
interesting,
and probably we should meet him

00:15:22.831 --> 00:15:26.054
at least halfway to see,
to measure, the degree of

00:15:26.054 --> 00:15:27.730
interest we may have in it.
 

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:31.630
So yes, there is the
question--there is the fact that

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:36.133
stands before u--that this very
authoritative-sounding person

00:15:36.133 --> 00:15:38.610
seems to be an author,
right?

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:43.346
I never met anybody who seemed
more like an author than this

00:15:43.346 --> 00:15:45.615
person,
and yet he's raising the

00:15:45.615 --> 00:15:48.240
question whether there is any
such thing,

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.094
or in any case,
the question how difficult it

00:15:51.094 --> 00:15:53.558
is to decide what it is if there
is.

00:15:53.558 --> 00:15:58.916
Let me digress with an anecdote
which may or may not sort of

00:15:58.916 --> 00:16:03.817
help us to understand the
delicacy of this relationship

00:16:03.817 --> 00:16:08.192
between a star author,
a person undeniably a star

00:16:08.192 --> 00:16:12.480
author, and the atmosphere of
thought in which there is,

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.990
in a certain sense,
no such thing as an author.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:19.374
An old crony and former
colleague of mine was taking a

00:16:19.374 --> 00:16:22.600
course at Johns Hopkins in the
1960s.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:27.600
This was a time when Hopkins
led all American universities in

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.600
the importing of important
European scholars,

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.918
and it was a place of
remarkable intellectual ferment.

00:16:35.918 --> 00:16:40.355
This particular lecture course
was being given by Georges

00:16:40.355 --> 00:16:44.000
Poulet, a so-called
phenomenological critic.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.785
That's one of the
"isms"

00:16:45.785 --> 00:16:47.788
we aren't covering in this
seminar.

00:16:47.788 --> 00:16:50.820
In any case,
Poulet was also a central

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.850
figure on the scene of the
sixties.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.341
Poulet would be lecturing
along, and the students had

00:16:57.341 --> 00:17:00.500
somehow formed a habit of from
time to time--

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.139
by the way, you can form this
habit,

00:17:02.139 --> 00:17:05.798
too--of raising their hand,
and what they would do is they

00:17:05.798 --> 00:17:08.751
would utter a name--
at least this is what my friend

00:17:08.751 --> 00:17:09.200
noticed.
 

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.469
They would raise their hand and
they would say,

00:17:11.469 --> 00:17:12.950
"Mallarmé."
 

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:15.416
And Poulet would look at them
and say, "Mais,

00:17:15.416 --> 00:17:15.720
oui!
 

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.799
Exactement!
 

00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:19.380
A mon avis aussi!"
 

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:25.368
And then he would go on and
continue to lecture for a while.

00:17:25.368 --> 00:17:26.868
Then somebody else would raise
his hand and say,

00:17:26.868 --> 00:17:27.538
"Proust."
 

00:17:27.538 --> 00:17:31.319
"Ah,
précisément!

00:17:31.319 --> 00:17:31.859
Proust.
 

00:17:31.859 --> 00:17:32.559
Proust."
 

00:17:32.559 --> 00:17:35.029
And then he'd continue along.
 

00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:37.226
So my friend decided he'd give
it a try

00:17:37.226 --> 00:17:38.730
&gt;
 

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:42.578
and he raised his hand and he
said,

00:17:42.578 --> 00:17:45.606
"Voltaire,"
and Poulet said "Quoi

00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:48.376
doncâ€¦ Je ne vous
comprends pas,"

00:17:48.376 --> 00:17:52.176
and then paused and hesitated
and continued with his lecture

00:17:52.176 --> 00:17:55.720
as though my friend had never
asked his question.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.566
Now this is a ritual of
introducing names,

00:17:59.566 --> 00:18:04.162
and in a certain sense,
yes, the names of authors,

00:18:04.162 --> 00:18:07.991
the names of stars;
but at the same time,

00:18:07.991 --> 00:18:12.692
plainly names that stand for
something other than their mere

00:18:12.692 --> 00:18:16.882
name,
names that stand for domains or

00:18:16.882 --> 00:18:20.691
fields of interesting
discursivity:

00:18:20.691 --> 00:18:24.663
that is to say--
I mean, Poulet was the kind of

00:18:24.663 --> 00:18:28.352
critic who believed that the
oeuvre of an author was a

00:18:28.352 --> 00:18:31.301
totality that could be
understood as a structural

00:18:31.301 --> 00:18:34.172
whole,
and his criticism worked that

00:18:34.172 --> 00:18:34.538
way.
 

00:18:34.538 --> 00:18:40.032
And so yes, the signal that
this field of discursivity is on

00:18:40.032 --> 00:18:45.154
the table is introduced by the
name of the author but it

00:18:45.154 --> 00:18:47.390
remains just a name.
 

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:52.904
It's an author without
authority, yet at the same time

00:18:52.904 --> 00:18:58.314
it's an author who stands for,
whose name stands for,

00:18:58.314 --> 00:19:02.058
an important field of
discourse.

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:04.070
That's of course what my
friend--because he knew

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.339
perfectly well that when he said
"Voltaire,"

00:19:06.339 --> 00:19:08.009
Poulet would
&gt;

00:19:08.009 --> 00:19:12.685
have nothing to do with
it--that's the idea that my

00:19:12.685 --> 00:19:15.960
friend wanted to experiment
with.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.907
There are relevant and
interesting fields of discourse

00:19:18.907 --> 00:19:22.190
and there are completely
irrelevant fields of discourse,

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:26.376
and some of these fields are on
the sides of angelic discourse

00:19:26.376 --> 00:19:30.358
and some of these fields are on
the side of the demonic.

00:19:30.358 --> 00:19:33.965
We simply, kind of
spontaneously,

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:36.220
make the division.
 

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.386
Discursivity,
discourse: that's what I forgot

00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:41.259
to talk about last time.
 

00:19:41.259 --> 00:19:45.131
When I said that sometimes
people just ultimately throw up

00:19:45.131 --> 00:19:49.068
their hands when they try to
define literature and say,

00:19:49.068 --> 00:19:51.769
"Well, literature's just
whatever you say it is.

00:19:51.769 --> 00:19:53.038
Fine.
 

00:19:53.038 --> 00:19:56.690
Let's just go ahead,"
they are then much more likely,

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:00.394
rather than using the word
"literature,"

00:20:00.394 --> 00:20:03.117
to use the word
"discourse"

00:20:03.117 --> 00:20:07.578
or "textual field,"
"discursivity."

00:20:07.578 --> 00:20:10.515
You begin to hear,
or perhaps smell,

00:20:10.515 --> 00:20:15.799
the slight whiff of jargon that
pervades theoretical writing.

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:17.680
It often does so for a reason.
 

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.480
This is the reason one hears so
much about discourse.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:27.066
Simply because of doubt about
the generic integrity of various

00:20:27.066 --> 00:20:28.990
forms of discourse.
 

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:32.400
One can speak hesitantly of
literary discourse,

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.000
political discourse,
anthropological discourse,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.400
but one doesn't want to go so
far as to say literature,

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.250
political science, anthropology.
 

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:48.733
It's a habit that arises from
the sense of the permeability of

00:20:48.733 --> 00:20:53.500
all forms of utterance with
respect to each other,

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:58.122
and that habit,
as I say, is a breakdown of the

00:20:58.122 --> 00:21:04.152
notion that certain forms of
utterance can be understood as a

00:21:04.152 --> 00:21:07.930
delimited,
structured field.

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:11.506
One of the reasons this
understanding seems so

00:21:11.506 --> 00:21:16.511
problematic is the idea that we
don't appeal to the authority of

00:21:16.511 --> 00:21:20.883
an author in making our mind
about the nature of a given

00:21:20.883 --> 00:21:22.868
field of discourse.
 

00:21:22.868 --> 00:21:28.074
We find the authority of the
author instead somewhere within

00:21:28.074 --> 00:21:30.278
the textual experience.
 

00:21:30.278 --> 00:21:33.737
The author is a signal,
is what Foucault calls a

00:21:33.737 --> 00:21:35.430
"function."
 

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:39.654
By the way, this isn't at all a
question of the author not

00:21:39.654 --> 00:21:40.470
existing.
 

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.584
Yes, Barthes talks about the
death of the author,

00:21:43.584 --> 00:21:47.281
but even Barthes doesn't mean
that the author is dead like

00:21:47.281 --> 00:21:48.579
Nietzsche's God.
 

00:21:48.579 --> 00:21:50.848
The author is there, sure.
 

00:21:50.848 --> 00:21:55.548
It's a question rather of how
we know the author to be there,

00:21:55.548 --> 00:22:00.385
firstly, and secondly,
whether or not in attempting to

00:22:00.385 --> 00:22:03.578
determine the meaning of a
text--

00:22:03.578 --> 00:22:05.630
and this is something we'll be
talking about next week--

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:09.578
we should appeal to the
authority of an author.

00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:13.920
If the author is a function,
that function is something that

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.630
appears,
perhaps problematically

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:20.348
appears, within the experience
of the text,

00:22:20.348 --> 00:22:23.940
something we get in terms of
the speaker,

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.858
the narrator,
or--in the case of plays--

00:22:26.858 --> 00:22:30.961
as the inferred orchestrator of
the text: something that we

00:22:30.961 --> 00:22:33.650
infer from the way the text
unfolds.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:39.305
So as a function and not as a
subjective consciousness to

00:22:39.305 --> 00:22:44.960
which we appeal to grasp a
meaning, the author still does

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.970
exist.
 

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:50.368
So we consider a text as a
structured entity,

00:22:50.368 --> 00:22:53.551
or perhaps as an entity which
is structured and yet at the

00:22:53.551 --> 00:22:56.680
same time somehow or another
passes out of structure--

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.009
that's the case with Roland
Barthes.

00:22:59.009 --> 00:23:04.298
Here I want to appeal to a
couple of passages.

00:23:04.298 --> 00:23:08.374
I want to quote from the
beginning of Roland Barthes'

00:23:08.374 --> 00:23:10.410
essay,
which I know I only suggested,

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:13.115
but I'm simply going to quote
the passage so you don't have to

00:23:13.115 --> 00:23:15.210
have read it,
The Death of the Author.

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:18.116
It's on page 874 for those of
you who have your texts,

00:23:18.116 --> 00:23:19.160
as I hope you do.
 

00:23:22.538 --> 00:23:25.972
Barthes, while writing
this--he's writing what has

00:23:25.972 --> 00:23:30.038
perhaps in retrospect seemed to
be his most important book,

00:23:30.038 --> 00:23:31.650
it's called S/Z.
 

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:35.917
It's a huge book which is
all about this short story by

00:23:35.917 --> 00:23:40.185
Balzac, "Sarrasine,"
that he begins this essay by

00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:41.068
quoting.
 

00:23:41.068 --> 00:23:44.068
This is what he says here about
"Sarrasine":

00:23:44.068 --> 00:23:45.626
In his story
"Sarrasine"

00:23:45.626 --> 00:23:48.522
Balzac,
describing a castrato disguised

00:23:48.522 --> 00:23:51.695
as a woman,
writes the following sentence:

00:23:51.695 --> 00:23:54.140
"This was woman
herself,

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.890
with her sudden fears,
her irrational whims,

00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:00.220
her instinctive worries,
her impetuous boldness,

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:04.267
her fussings and her delicious
sensibility."

00:24:04.267 --> 00:24:07.769
[Barthes says,]
"Who is speaking thus?

00:24:07.769 --> 00:24:11.933
Is it the hero of the story
bent on remaining ignorant of

00:24:11.933 --> 00:24:14.910
the castrato hidden beneath the
woman?

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:19.805
Is it Balzac the individual,
furnished by his personal

00:24:19.805 --> 00:24:23.500
experience with a philosophy of
Woman?

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:28.814
Is it Balzac the author
professing "literary"

00:24:28.814 --> 00:24:30.980
ideas on femininity?
 

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.140
Is it universal wisdom?
 

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.670
Romantic psychology?
 

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:40.096
We shall never know,
for the good reason that

00:24:40.096 --> 00:24:46.032
writing is the destruction of
every voice, of every point of

00:24:46.032 --> 00:24:47.140
origin.
 

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:50.779
Writing is that neutral,
composite,

00:24:50.779 --> 00:24:55.190
oblique space where our subject
[and this is a deliberate pun]

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:57.648
slips away ["our
subject"

00:24:57.648 --> 00:25:01.769
meaning that we don't quite
know what's being talked about

00:25:01.769 --> 00:25:04.874
sometimes,
but also and more importantly

00:25:04.874 --> 00:25:07.782
the subject,
the authorial subject,

00:25:07.782 --> 00:25:12.519
the actual identity of the
given speaking subject--

00:25:12.519 --> 00:25:17.511
that's what slips away]
the negative where all identity

00:25:17.511 --> 00:25:21.439
is lost,
starting with the very identity

00:25:21.439 --> 00:25:23.410
of the body writing.
 

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:27.582
So that's a shot fired across
the bow against the author

00:25:27.582 --> 00:25:31.223
because it's Barthes'
supposition that the author

00:25:31.223 --> 00:25:35.928
isn't maybe even quite an author
function because that function

00:25:35.928 --> 00:25:40.404
may be hard to identify in a
discrete way among myriad other

00:25:40.404 --> 00:25:41.769
functions.
 

00:25:41.769 --> 00:25:47.594
Foucault, who I think does take
for granted that a textual field

00:25:47.594 --> 00:25:52.308
is more firmly structured than
Barthes supposes,

00:25:52.308 --> 00:26:04.818
says on page 913 that when we
speak of the author function,

00:26:04.818 --> 00:26:08.711
as opposed to the author--and
here I begin quoting at the

00:26:08.711 --> 00:26:11.910
bottom of the left-hand column
on page 913--

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:16.140
when we speak in this way we no
longer raise the questions:

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.561
"How can a free subject
penetrate the substance of

00:26:19.561 --> 00:26:21.400
things and give it meaning?
 

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.626
How can it activate the rules
of a language from within and

00:26:25.626 --> 00:26:29.709
thus give rise to the designs
which are properly own- its

00:26:29.709 --> 00:26:30.730
own?"
 

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.387
In other words,
we no longer say,

00:26:33.387 --> 00:26:38.539
"How does the author exert
autonomous will with respect to

00:26:38.539 --> 00:26:42.279
the subject matter being
expressed?"

00:26:42.279 --> 00:26:45.111
We no longer appeal,
in other words,

00:26:45.111 --> 00:26:49.803
to the authority of the author
as the source of the meaning

00:26:49.803 --> 00:26:52.150
that we find in the text.
 

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:55.832
Foucault continues,
Instead, these questions will

00:26:55.832 --> 00:26:59.532
be raised: "How,
under what conditions,

00:26:59.532 --> 00:27:04.155
and in what forms can something
like a subject appear in the

00:27:04.155 --> 00:27:05.880
order of discourse?
 

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:10.243
What place can it occupy in
each type of discourse,

00:27:10.243 --> 00:27:14.432
what functions can it assume,
and by obeying what

00:27:14.432 --> 00:27:15.828
rules?"
 

00:27:15.828 --> 00:27:18.634
In short, it is a matter of
depriving the subject (or its

00:27:18.634 --> 00:27:20.588
substitute)â€¦
[That is to say,

00:27:20.588 --> 00:27:23.588
when we speak in this way of an
author function,]

00:27:23.588 --> 00:27:27.402
it is a matter of depriving the
subject (or its substitute) [a

00:27:27.402 --> 00:27:29.570
character,
for example,

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:33.779
or a speaker,
as we say when we don't mean

00:27:33.779 --> 00:27:40.039
that it's the poet talking but
the guy speaking in "My

00:27:40.039 --> 00:27:43.529
Last Duchess"
or whatever]

00:27:43.529 --> 00:27:49.487
of its role as originator,
and of analyzing the subject as

00:27:49.487 --> 00:27:53.150
a variable and complex function
of discourse.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:56.136
"The subject"
here always means the

00:27:56.136 --> 00:28:00.278
subjectivity of the speaker,
right, not the subject matter.

00:28:00.278 --> 00:28:03.978
You'll get used to it because
it's a word that does a lot of

00:28:03.978 --> 00:28:06.606
duty,
and you need to develop context

00:28:06.606 --> 00:28:09.009
in which you recognize that
well,

00:28:09.009 --> 00:28:11.558
yeah, I'm talking about the
human subject or well,

00:28:11.558 --> 00:28:12.900
I'm talking about the subject
matter;

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:18.998
but I trust that you will
quickly kind of adjust to that

00:28:18.998 --> 00:28:20.440
difficulty.
 

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.640
All right.
 

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.664
So with this said,
it's probably time to say

00:28:25.664 --> 00:28:29.130
something in defense of the
author.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:32.796
I know that you wish you could
stand up here and say something

00:28:32.796 --> 00:28:36.528
in defense of the author,
so I will speak in behalf of

00:28:36.528 --> 00:28:40.333
all of you who want to defend
the author by quoting a

00:28:40.333 --> 00:28:44.137
wonderful passage from Samuel
Johnson's Preface to

00:28:44.137 --> 00:28:48.528
Shakespeare, in which
he explains for us why it is

00:28:48.528 --> 00:28:53.650
that we have always paid homage
to the authority of the author.

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:56.276
It's not just a question,
as obviously Foucault and

00:28:56.276 --> 00:28:59.832
Barthes are always suggesting,
of deferring to authority as

00:28:59.832 --> 00:29:03.804
though the authority were the
police with a baton in its hand,

00:29:03.804 --> 00:29:04.390
right?
 

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:07.760
It's not a question of
deferring to authority in that

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.278
sense.
 

00:29:08.278 --> 00:29:12.724
It's a question,
rather, of affirming what we

00:29:12.724 --> 00:29:15.150
call the human spirit.
 

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:19.453
This is what Johnson says:
There is always a silent

00:29:19.453 --> 00:29:22.970
reference of human works to
human abilities,

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:27.385
and as the inquiry,
how far man may extend his

00:29:27.385 --> 00:29:32.490
designs or how high he may rate
his native force,

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:37.663
is of far greater dignity than
in what rank we shall place any

00:29:37.663 --> 00:29:42.156
particular performance,
curiosity is always busy to

00:29:42.156 --> 00:29:47.578
discover the instruments as well
as to survey the workmanship,

00:29:47.578 --> 00:29:52.415
to know how much is to be
ascribed to original powers and

00:29:52.415 --> 00:29:56.130
how much to casual and
adventitious help.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.618
So what Johnson is saying is:
well,

00:29:58.618 --> 00:30:01.220
it's all very well to consider
a textual field,

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:05.193
the workmanship,
but at the same time we want to

00:30:05.193 --> 00:30:07.900
remind ourselves of our worth.
 

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.494
We want to say,
"Well, gee,

00:30:10.494 --> 00:30:13.509
that wasn't produced by a
machine.

00:30:13.509 --> 00:30:16.461
That's not just a set of
functions--variables,

00:30:16.461 --> 00:30:18.430
as one might say in the lab.
 

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:22.190
It's produced by genius.
 

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:26.403
It's something that allows us
to rate human ability

00:30:26.403 --> 00:30:27.500
high."
 

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.948
And that, especially in this
vale of tears--and Johnson is

00:30:30.948 --> 00:30:34.518
very conscious of this being a
vale of tears--that's what we

00:30:34.518 --> 00:30:35.910
want to keep doing.
 

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:40.710
We want to rate human potential
as high as we can,

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:43.740
and it is for that reason in a
completely different spirit,

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:48.230
in the spirit of homage rather
than cringing fear,

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:52.868
that we appeal to the authority
of an author.

00:30:52.868 --> 00:30:55.609
Well, that's an argument for
the other side,

00:30:55.609 --> 00:30:57.650
but these are different times.
 

00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:02.433
This is 1969,
and the purpose that's alleged

00:31:02.433 --> 00:31:08.220
for appealing to the author as a
paternal source,

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:11.834
as an authority,
is, according to both Barthes

00:31:11.834 --> 00:31:16.000
and Foucault,
to police the way texts are

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:16.640
read.
 

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.816
In other words,
both of them insist that the

00:31:19.816 --> 00:31:23.913
appeal to the author--
as opposed to the submersion of

00:31:23.913 --> 00:31:28.038
the author in the functionality
of the textual field--

00:31:28.038 --> 00:31:36.790
is a kind of delimitation or
policing of the possibilities of

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:38.250
meaning.
 

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:43.421
Let me just read two texts to
that effect, first going back to

00:31:43.421 --> 00:31:45.880
Roland Barthes on page 877.
 

00:31:52.529 --> 00:31:55.567
Barthes says,
"Once the Author is

00:31:55.567 --> 00:32:01.068
removed, the claim to decipher a
text becomes quite futile."

00:32:01.068 --> 00:32:03.558
By the way, once again there's
a bit of a rift there between

00:32:03.558 --> 00:32:04.528
Barthes and Foucault.
 

00:32:04.528 --> 00:32:06.549
Foucault wouldn't say
"quite futile."

00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:07.470
He would say, "Oh, no.
 

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:10.135
We can decipher it,
but the author function is just

00:32:10.135 --> 00:32:12.588
one aspect of the deciphering
process."

00:32:12.588 --> 00:32:16.316
But Barthes has entered a phase
of his career in which you

00:32:16.316 --> 00:32:20.239
actually think that structures
are so complex that they cease

00:32:20.239 --> 00:32:24.227
to be structures and that this
has a great deal to do with the

00:32:24.227 --> 00:32:26.450
influence of deconstruction.
 

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:29.420
We'll come back to that much
later in the course.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.430
In any case, he continues.
 

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:36.839
To give a text an Author is to
impose a limit on that text,

00:32:36.839 --> 00:32:42.529
to furnish it with a final
signified, to close the writing.

00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:46.282
Such a conception suits
criticism [and criticism is a

00:32:46.282 --> 00:32:48.973
lot like policing,
right--"criticism"

00:32:48.973 --> 00:32:51.284
means being a critic,
criticizing]

00:32:51.284 --> 00:32:57.559
very well, the latter then
allotting itself the important

00:32:57.559 --> 00:33:03.050
task of discovering the Author
(or its hypostases:

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:05.855
society,
history, psyché,

00:33:05.855 --> 00:33:09.078
liberty) beneath the work:
when the Author has been found,

00:33:09.078 --> 00:33:11.820
the text is
"explained"-- a

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.650
victory to the critic.
 

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:16.609
In other words,
the policing of meaning has

00:33:16.609 --> 00:33:20.980
been accomplished and the critic
wins, just as in the uprisings

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.660
of the late sixties,
the cops win.

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:28.676
This is, again,
the atmosphere in which all of

00:33:28.676 --> 00:33:33.318
this occurs--
just then to reinforce this

00:33:33.318 --> 00:33:39.368
with the pronouncement of
Foucault at the bottom of page

00:33:39.368 --> 00:33:41.794
913,
right-hand column:

00:33:41.794 --> 00:33:46.940
"The author is therefore
the ideological figure by which

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:51.829
one marks the manner in which we
fear the proliferation of

00:33:51.829 --> 00:33:53.460
meaning."
 

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.420
Now once again,
there is this sort of the

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.640
skepticism about skepticism.
 

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.288
You say, "Why shouldn't I
fear the proliferation of

00:34:01.288 --> 00:34:01.769
meaning?
 

00:34:01.769 --> 00:34:04.278
I want to know what something
definitely means.

00:34:04.278 --> 00:34:06.368
I don't want to know that it
means a million things.

00:34:06.368 --> 00:34:10.349
I'm here to learn what things
mean in so many words.

00:34:10.349 --> 00:34:13.425
I don't want to be told that I
could sit here for the rest of

00:34:13.425 --> 00:34:15.679
my life just sort of parsing one
sentence.

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:17.530
Don't tell me about that.
 

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:20.554
Don't tell me about these
complicated sentences from

00:34:20.554 --> 00:34:21.920
Balzac's short story.
 

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.139
I'm here to know what things
mean.

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:27.079
I don't care if it's policing
or not.

00:34:27.079 --> 00:34:29.360
Whatever it is,
let's get it done."

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.963
That, of course,
is approaching the question of

00:34:32.963 --> 00:34:37.510
how we might delimit meaning in
a very different spirit.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:44.210
The reason I acknowledge the
legitimacy of responding in this

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:50.690
way is that to a certain extent
the preoccupation with--

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:55.550
what shall we say?--the misuse
of the appeal to an author is

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:58.599
very much of its historical
moment.

00:34:58.599 --> 00:35:01.329
That is to say,
when one can scarcely say the

00:35:01.329 --> 00:35:03.751
word "author"
without thinking

00:35:03.751 --> 00:35:06.853
"authority,"
and one can definitely never

00:35:06.853 --> 00:35:08.902
say the word
"authority"

00:35:08.902 --> 00:35:11.510
without thinking about the
police.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:16.007
This is a structure of thought
that perhaps pervades the lives

00:35:16.007 --> 00:35:20.505
of many of us to this day and
has always pervaded the lives of

00:35:20.505 --> 00:35:24.719
many people,
but is not quite as hegemonic

00:35:24.719 --> 00:35:30.947
in our thinking today perhaps as
it was in the moment of these

00:35:30.947 --> 00:35:34.420
essays by Barthes and Foucault.
 

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:35.659
All right.
 

00:35:35.659 --> 00:35:39.684
With all this said,
how can the theorist recuperate

00:35:39.684 --> 00:35:42.983
honor for certain names like,
for example,

00:35:42.983 --> 00:35:43.949
his own?
 

00:35:43.949 --> 00:35:45.559
"All right.
 

00:35:45.559 --> 00:35:46.590
It's all very well.
 

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:49.675
You're not an author,
but I secretly think I'm an

00:35:49.675 --> 00:35:51.090
author, right?"
 

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:56.914
Let's suppose someone were
dastardly enough to harbor such

00:35:56.914 --> 00:35:58.039
thoughts.
 

00:35:58.039 --> 00:36:02.840
How could you develop an
argument in which a thought like

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.840
that might actually seem to
work?

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.360
After all, Foucault--setting
himself aside,

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.132
he doesn't mention
himself--Foucault very much

00:36:13.132 --> 00:36:15.480
admires certain writers.
 

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.639
In particular,
he admires, like so many of his

00:36:18.639 --> 00:36:22.219
generation and other
generations, Marx and Freud.

00:36:22.219 --> 00:36:29.360
It's a problem if we reject the
police-like authority of

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.784
authors,
of whom we may have a certain

00:36:32.784 --> 00:36:36.311
suspicion on those grounds,
when we certainly don't feel

00:36:36.311 --> 00:36:38.010
that way about Marx and Freud.
 

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:39.768
What's the difference then?
 

00:36:39.768 --> 00:36:46.724
How is Foucault going to mount
an argument in which privileged

00:36:46.724 --> 00:36:48.936
authors--
that is to say,

00:36:48.936 --> 00:36:52.251
figures whom one cites
positively and without a sense

00:36:52.251 --> 00:36:56.086
of being policed--
can somehow or another stay in

00:36:56.086 --> 00:36:57.170
the picture?
 

00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:00.079
Foucault, by the way,
doesn't mention Nietzsche,

00:37:00.079 --> 00:37:02.675
but he might very well because
Nietzsche's idea of

00:37:02.675 --> 00:37:04.952
"genealogy"
is perhaps the central

00:37:04.952 --> 00:37:06.699
influence on Foucault's work.
 

00:37:06.699 --> 00:37:10.715
Frankly, I think it's just an
accident that he doesn't mention

00:37:10.715 --> 00:37:11.110
him.
 

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:14.927
It would have been a perfect
symmetry because last time we

00:37:14.927 --> 00:37:18.679
quoted Paul Ricoeur to the
effect that these authors,

00:37:18.679 --> 00:37:21.447
Marx, Nietzsche,
and Freud, were--and this is

00:37:21.447 --> 00:37:23.900
Ricoeur's word--
"masters."

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:24.650
Whoa!
 

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:26.710
That's the last thing we want
to hear.

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:29.030
They're not masters.
 

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:33.083
Foucault couldn't possibly
allow for that because plainly

00:37:33.083 --> 00:37:37.280
the whole texture of their
discourse would be undermined by

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.480
introducing the notion that it's
okay to be a master,

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:46.074
and yet Ricoeur feels that
these figures dominate modern

00:37:46.074 --> 00:37:47.829
thought as masters.
 

00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:49.730
How does Foucault deal with
this?

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:52.018
He invents a concept.
 

00:37:52.018 --> 00:37:55.719
He says, "They aren't
authors.

00:37:55.719 --> 00:37:59.014
They're founders of
discursivity,"

00:37:59.014 --> 00:38:04.215
and then he grants that it's
kind of difficult to distinguish

00:38:04.215 --> 00:38:08.552
between a founder of
discursivity and an author who

00:38:08.552 --> 00:38:11.760
has had an important influence.
 

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.199
Right?
 

00:38:12.199 --> 00:38:15.494
And then he talks about the
gothic novel and he talks about

00:38:15.494 --> 00:38:18.106
Radcliffe's, Anne
Radcliffe's--he's wrong about

00:38:18.106 --> 00:38:19.300
this, by the way.
 

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.818
The founder of discursivity in
the gothic novel is not Anne

00:38:21.818 --> 00:38:23.360
Radcliffe;
it's Horace Walpole,

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:27.496
but that's okay--
he talks about Anne Radcliffe

00:38:27.496 --> 00:38:32.710
as the person who establishes
certain tropes,

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:36.385
topoi, and
premises that govern the writing

00:38:36.385 --> 00:38:39.800
of gothic fiction for the next
hundred years and,

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.380
indeed, even in to the present,
so that she is,

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:45.722
Foucault acknowledges,
in a certain sense a person who

00:38:45.722 --> 00:38:48.773
establishes a way of talking,
a way of writing,

00:38:48.773 --> 00:38:49.989
a way of narrating.
 

00:38:49.989 --> 00:38:53.960
But at the same time she isn't
a person,

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:59.798
Foucault claims,
who introduces a discourse or

00:38:59.798 --> 00:39:04.860
sphere of debate within which
ideas,

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:08.090
without being attributable
necessarily,

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:10.750
can nevertheless be developed.
 

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:12.550
Well, I don't know.
 

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:16.641
It seems to me that literary
influence is not at all unlike

00:39:16.641 --> 00:39:20.449
sort of speaking or writing in
the wake of a founder of

00:39:20.449 --> 00:39:23.380
discursivity,
but we can let that pass.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.038
On the other hand,
Foucault is very concerned to

00:39:26.038 --> 00:39:29.487
distinguish figures like this
from scientists like Galileo and

00:39:29.487 --> 00:39:30.110
Newton.
 

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:32.612
Now it is interesting,
by the way, maybe in defense of

00:39:32.612 --> 00:39:35.271
Foucault,
that whereas we speak of people

00:39:35.271 --> 00:39:39.938
as Marxist or Freudian,
we don't speak of people as

00:39:39.938 --> 00:39:44.130
Radcliffian or Galilean or
Newtonian.

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:45.876
We use the adjective
"Newtonian"

00:39:45.876 --> 00:39:48.476
but we don't speak of certain
writers who are still interested

00:39:48.476 --> 00:39:50.949
in quantum mechanics as
"Newtonian writers."

00:39:50.949 --> 00:39:56.251
That's interesting in a way,
and may somehow or another

00:39:56.251 --> 00:40:02.141
justify Foucault's understanding
of the texts of those author

00:40:02.141 --> 00:40:05.969
functions known as Marx and
Freud--

00:40:05.969 --> 00:40:10.268
whose names might be raised in
Poulet's lecture class with an

00:40:10.268 --> 00:40:14.487
enthusiastic response--
as place holders for those

00:40:14.487 --> 00:40:16.449
fields of discourse.
 

00:40:16.449 --> 00:40:21.413
It may, in some sense,
reinforce Foucault's argument

00:40:21.413 --> 00:40:26.280
that these are special
inaugurations of debate,

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:30.983
of developing thought,
that do not necessarily

00:40:30.983 --> 00:40:35.268
kowtow to the originary
figure--

00:40:35.268 --> 00:40:39.016
certainly debatable,
but we don't want to pause over

00:40:39.016 --> 00:40:42.250
it in the case either of Marx or
of Freud.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:44.989
Plainly, there are a great many
people who think of them as

00:40:44.989 --> 00:40:47.391
tyrants,
right, but within the

00:40:47.391 --> 00:40:50.530
traditions that they
established,

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:54.898
it is very possible to
understand them as instigating

00:40:54.898 --> 00:40:59.601
ways of thinking without
necessarily presiding over those

00:40:59.601 --> 00:41:02.710
ways of thinking
authoritatively.

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:07.635
That is the special category
that Foucault wants to reserve

00:41:07.635 --> 00:41:12.135
for those privileged figures
whom he calls founders of

00:41:12.135 --> 00:41:13.579
discursivity.
 

00:41:13.579 --> 00:41:14.360
All right.
 

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:18.490
Very quickly then to conclude:
one consequence of the death of

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:21.679
the author,
and the disappearance of the

00:41:21.679 --> 00:41:27.384
author into author function is,
as Foucault curiously says in

00:41:27.384 --> 00:41:31.677
passing on page 907,
that the author has no legal

00:41:31.677 --> 00:41:32.239
status.
 

00:41:32.239 --> 00:41:33.860
And you say, "What?
 

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:34.829
What about copyright?
 

00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:36.949
What about intellectual
property?

00:41:36.949 --> 00:41:40.067
That's a horrible thing to say,
that the author has no legal

00:41:40.067 --> 00:41:40.860
status."
 

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.110
Notice once again the
intellectual context.

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:48.630
Copyright arose as a bourgeois
idea.

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:51.780
That is to say,
"I possess my writing.

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:54.481
I have an ownership
relationship with my

00:41:54.481 --> 00:41:55.590
writing."
 

00:41:55.590 --> 00:42:00.807
The disappearance of the
author, like a kind of corollary

00:42:00.807 --> 00:42:04.349
disappearance of bourgeois
thought,

00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:08.661
entails, in fact,
a kind of bracketing of the

00:42:08.661 --> 00:42:13.070
idea of copyright or
intellectual property.

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:16.744
And so there's a certain
consistency in what Foucault is

00:42:16.744 --> 00:42:20.018
saying about the author having
no legal status.

00:42:20.018 --> 00:42:24.000
But maybe at this point it
really is time to dig in our

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:24.590
heels.
 

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:29.829
"I am a lesbian Latina.
 

00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:37.793
I stand before you as an author
articulating an identity for the

00:42:37.793 --> 00:42:44.192
purpose of achieving freedom,
not to police you,

00:42:44.192 --> 00:42:53.018
not to deny your freedom,
but to find my own freedom.

00:42:53.018 --> 00:42:57.280
And I stand before you
precisely, and in pride,

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.670
as an author.
 

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:02.309
I don't want to be called an
author function.

00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:05.927
I don't want to be called an
instrument of something larger

00:43:05.927 --> 00:43:09.670
than myself because frankly
that's what I've always been,

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:15.769
and I want precisely as an
authority through my authorship

00:43:15.769 --> 00:43:21.978
to remind you that I am not
anybody's instrument but that I

00:43:21.978 --> 00:43:25.510
am autonomous and free."
 

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:29.132
In other words,
the author, the traditional

00:43:29.132 --> 00:43:32.563
idea of the author--
so much under suspicion in the

00:43:32.563 --> 00:43:35.170
work of Foucault and Barthes in
the late sixties--

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:39.739
can be turned on its ear.
 

00:43:39.739 --> 00:43:46.530
It can be understood as a
source of new-found authority,

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:52.623
of the freedom of one who has
been characteristically not free

00:43:52.623 --> 00:43:58.619
and can be received by a reading
community in those terms.

00:43:58.619 --> 00:44:04.458
It's very difficult to think
how a Foucault might respond to

00:44:04.458 --> 00:44:08.585
that insistence,
and it's a problem that in a

00:44:08.585 --> 00:44:11.708
way dogs everything,
or many of the things we're

00:44:11.708 --> 00:44:14.579
going to be reading during the
course of this semester--

00:44:14.579 --> 00:44:17.608
even within the sorts of
theorizing that are

00:44:17.608 --> 00:44:21.340
characteristically called
cultural studies and concern

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:24.300
questions of the politics of
identity.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:30.023
Even within those disciplines
there is a division of thought

00:44:30.023 --> 00:44:35.164
between people who affirm the
autonomous integrity and

00:44:35.164 --> 00:44:41.177
individuality of the identity in
question and those who say any

00:44:41.177 --> 00:44:46.610
and all identities are only
subject positions discernible

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:52.429
and revealed through the matrix
of social practices.

00:44:52.429 --> 00:44:57.353
There is this intrinsic split
even within those forms of

00:44:57.353 --> 00:45:00.094
theory--
and not to mention the kinds of

00:45:00.094 --> 00:45:03.485
theory that don't directly have
to do with the politics of

00:45:03.485 --> 00:45:06.784
identity--
between those for whom what's

00:45:06.784 --> 00:45:11.659
at stake is the discovery of
autonomous individuality and

00:45:11.659 --> 00:45:17.056
those for whom what's at stake
is the tendency to hold at arm's

00:45:17.056 --> 00:45:21.670
length such discoveries over
against the idea that the

00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:26.110
instability of any and all
subject positions is what

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:31.313
actually contains within it--
as Foucault and Barthes thought

00:45:31.313 --> 00:45:35.099
as they sort of sat looking at
the police standing over against

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:38.208
them--
those for whom this alternative

00:45:38.208 --> 00:45:42.668
notion of the undermining of any
sense of that which is

00:45:42.668 --> 00:45:46.880
authoritative is in its turn a
possible source,

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.260
finally, of freedom.
 

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:53.143
These sorts of vexing issues,
as I say, in all sorts of ways

00:45:53.143 --> 00:45:57.612
will dog much of what we read
during the course of this

00:45:57.612 --> 00:45:58.690
semester.
 

00:45:58.690 --> 00:45:59.199
All right.
 

00:45:59.199 --> 00:46:03.996
So much for the introductory
lectures which touch on aspects

00:46:03.996 --> 00:46:07.900
of the materials that we'll keep
returning to.

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:11.547
On Tuesday we'll turn to a more
specific subject matter:

00:46:11.547 --> 00:46:13.804
hermeneutics,
what hermeneutics is,

00:46:13.804 --> 00:46:17.518
how we can think about the
nature of interpretation.

00:46:17.518 --> 00:46:21.373
Our primary text will be the
excerpt in your book from

00:46:21.373 --> 00:46:25.518
Hans-Georg Gadamer and a few
passages that I'll be handing

00:46:25.518 --> 00:46:29.010
out from Martin Heidegger and
E.D. Hirsch.

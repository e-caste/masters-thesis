00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.722
Prof: Last time we
talked about the Book of

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:08.013
Revelation,
and I ended up by trying to

00:00:08.013 --> 00:00:12.403
place Revelation in the context
of Roman politics in the

00:00:12.403 --> 00:00:13.760
imperial cult.
 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.630
Clearly this author,
whoever wrote Revelation,

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.053
and it is somebody named John,
although as we said it's not

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:22.560
the same John who wrote the
Gospels or wrote the letters,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.189
it's not John son of Zebedee,
it's just some other guy named

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.620
John.
 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.920
John was a very common name for
Jews in the first century,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.636
so it's not uncommon that we
have a guy named John but don't

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:35.030
know exactly who he is in
relation to anybody else in

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.090
early Christianity.
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.477
One of the things that I ended
was by saying,

00:00:39.477 --> 00:00:41.710
let's imagine his politics.
 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.480
This is clearly an anti-Roman
document.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.500
That's the one thing we can say
about it for sure.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.627
Who would write this and why
would he write these seven

00:00:51.627 --> 00:00:55.160
letters to these seven churches
that we have in Revelation?

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.837
One way to think about this is
if this document was written

00:00:58.837 --> 00:01:01.689
toward the last part of the
first century,

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:05.209
as a lot of scholars think it
is, he may--

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:10.239
and I said remember his Greek
is bad.

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:12.953
He doesn't write Greek well,
sometimes it's even

00:01:12.953 --> 00:01:16.174
grammatically wrong in places,
and it's just bad Greek--even

00:01:16.174 --> 00:01:18.715
though we don't have really good
Greek in most of the New

00:01:18.715 --> 00:01:20.489
Testament,
but this is the worst.

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:23.575
What do you think of someone
who is against eating meat

00:01:23.575 --> 00:01:27.552
sacrificed to idols,
seems to think of himself as a

00:01:27.552 --> 00:01:30.081
true Jew,
and the Jews who are occupying

00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:33.340
synagogues in different parts of
Asia Minor as not true Jews,

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.120
and is anti-women as far as
their roles in the churches?

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.563
There's nothing we know about
this woman he calls Jezebel

00:01:41.563 --> 00:01:45.131
except that he's using this
nickname from the Old Testament

00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:47.530
for a whore-like idolatress
woman,

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.209
Jezebel, and labeling some
Christian woman,

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:52.790
who's a leader in one of these
churches.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.300
He's labeling her with this
terrible term.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.303
I suggested maybe he's actually
writing against the kind of

00:01:59.303 --> 00:02:03.030
Christianity we see represented
by Paul's churches,

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.853
which were right there in these
places such as Ephesus and

00:02:05.853 --> 00:02:08.753
Smyrna that he's writing too,
because Paul's churches

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:12.125
actually have people in them who
are fairly well off in some

00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:12.639
cases.
 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.120
They seem to be fairly
comfortable with Roman culture.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.480
They may have their own
businesses, they have their own

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.780
slaves, there are women leaders
in Paul's churches.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.090
Paul allows that sort of thing,
as some of you have pointed out

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.146
in your papers on that,
and they believe it's okay to

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:31.271
eat meat sacrificed to idols,
which this author seems to

00:02:31.271 --> 00:02:33.530
think is idolatrous in itself.
 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.745
I've suggested that maybe this
guy is writing Revelation

00:02:37.745 --> 00:02:42.497
precisely to attack the kind of
Christianity we see represented

00:02:42.497 --> 00:02:44.490
in Paul's own letters.
 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.250
What kind of person might this
be?

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.977
One way is just to imagine,
and this is pure speculation,

00:02:49.977 --> 00:02:53.104
pure imagination,
what if this guy had come from

00:02:53.104 --> 00:02:54.568
Palestine himself?
 

00:02:54.568 --> 00:02:57.811
Maybe he lived through the
Jewish war of 70 C.E.,

00:02:57.811 --> 00:02:59.500
remember it was 70 C.E.
 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.413
when the temple of Jerusalem
was destroyed and Jerusalem was

00:03:02.413 --> 00:03:03.598
overrun by the Romans.
 

00:03:03.598 --> 00:03:07.719
Thousands of Jews were taken
into slavery and taken to Rome

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.698
and sold off to be slaves,
and the land was devastated to

00:03:11.698 --> 00:03:13.188
a certain extent.
 

00:03:13.188 --> 00:03:17.923
Maybe he lived through that war
and that increased his hatred of

00:03:17.923 --> 00:03:18.900
the Romans.
 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.235
He gets to western Asia Minor,
he's travelling around other

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:24.419
parts of the eastern
Mediterranean,

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.611
he gets to western Asia Minor,
and here he doesn't see

00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:30.788
followers of Jesus who are,
like him, poor,

00:03:30.788 --> 00:03:35.777
not very well educated perhaps,
hateful of the Roman Empire and

00:03:35.777 --> 00:03:39.288
see themselves as being
oppressed by the Roman Empire.

00:03:39.288 --> 00:03:42.217
He sees Christians who think
that they're followers of Jesus

00:03:42.217 --> 00:03:44.848
also but they're fairly
comfortable in their world.

00:03:44.848 --> 00:03:48.543
They live in comfortable Greek
and Greco Roman urban

00:03:48.543 --> 00:03:49.628
environments.
 

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:52.748
So he writes Revelation to try
to shake them up,

00:03:52.748 --> 00:03:56.199
to get them to hate Rome as
much as he hates Rome.

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:00.900
To get them to be just as wary
of the imperial cult as he is.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.615
So that's one picture
definitely of early Christianity

00:04:04.615 --> 00:04:07.770
that we see an anti-Roman kind
of politics.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.092
The live question this week,
and the question you'll be

00:04:10.092 --> 00:04:12.930
talking about in your discussion
groups on Thursday and Friday,

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.830
and some of you will be writing
papers about,

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.439
is what is the politics of
early Christianity?

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:21.887
In the old Hollywood days,
the idea was that early

00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:25.610
Christianity was a movement of
slaves,

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.617
or all completely poor people,
and Rome was always going

00:04:28.617 --> 00:04:31.079
around persecuting early
Christian groups,

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:33.617
and there was these little
bands of early Christians

00:04:33.617 --> 00:04:35.459
huddled in dining rooms
somewhere,

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:37.019
or huddled in the catacombs in
Rome,

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:38.529
or huddled in caves.
 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:40.389
Well, that's Hollywood.
 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.483
The Romans actually didn't pay
that much attention to the early

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:46.129
Christian groups at all until
much later than this.

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.041
There was no coherent
persecution attempt by the

00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:54.620
Romans against the Jesus
movement at any time until much

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.370
later in history.
 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.062
You don't have Rome even taking
notice of most of these little

00:05:01.062 --> 00:05:05.833
house churches founded by Paul
and other Christian missionaries

00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:08.449
for the first several decades.
 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.196
You had actually a variety of
ways that these people

00:05:12.196 --> 00:05:16.750
themselves related to Rome as an
empire, and so we see that.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.050
With Revelation we see this
heavily anti-Roman view.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.610
But remember what Paul said in
Romans 13:

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.959
Let every person be subject to
the governing authorities,

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:29.470
for there is no authority
except from God,

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.454
and those authorities that
exist have been instituted by

00:05:32.454 --> 00:05:32.779
God.
 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:36.387
Therefore whoever resists
authority resist what God has

00:05:36.387 --> 00:05:37.190
appointed.
 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.870
[God has appointed the Roman
governors,

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.007
according to what Paul is
saying here.]

00:05:42.007 --> 00:05:44.259
Those who resist will incur
judgment,

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.680
for rulers are not a terror to
good conduct but too bad.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.901
Roman governors are a threat
only to people who are bad not

00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:52.629
to good?
 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:55.685
The writer of Revelation would
have disagreed with at

00:05:55.685 --> 00:05:56.449
completely.
 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:58.079
He would think this is crazy.
 

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:00.519
Do you wish to have no fear of
the authority?

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:03.088
Then do what is good and you
will receive its approval.

00:06:03.088 --> 00:06:08.149
For it is God's servant for
your good, but if you do what is

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:13.122
wrong you should be afraid,
for the authority does not bear

00:06:13.122 --> 00:06:15.009
the sword in vain.
 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.110
It is the servant of God to
execute wrath on the wrongdoer.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.482
The Roman governor,
from Paul's perspective,

00:06:20.482 --> 00:06:23.738
at least as he puts in there in
Romans 13, is actually God's

00:06:23.738 --> 00:06:25.560
servant to punish wrongdoing.
 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.968
Completely different view of
Roman power than we had in

00:06:29.968 --> 00:06:31.028
Revelation.
 

00:06:31.028 --> 00:06:33.850
So where do the different
documents of early

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.300
Christianity--
remember we've stressed in the

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.680
whole course the diversity of
early Christianity,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.300
its different Christianities in
the first century.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.822
Where do the different
documents line up on their

00:06:44.822 --> 00:06:45.629
politics?
 

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:49.230
Are they revolutionary or are
they accommodating to power?

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.370
Are they pro-Roman or are they
anti-Roman?

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:58.029
We've already got now two
seemingly opposite positions.

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:01.399
Except look over at 1
Corinthians now.

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:08.293
Remember, you have to have your
Bible's with you,

00:07:08.293 --> 00:07:13.360
1 Corinthians 2:6:
Yet among the mature we do

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.593
speak wisdom,
though it is not a wisdom of

00:07:16.593 --> 00:07:20.853
this age or of the rulers of
this age who are doomed to

00:07:20.853 --> 00:07:21.800
perish.
 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.375
But we speak God's wisdom
secret and hidden,

00:07:24.375 --> 00:07:27.370
which God decreed before the
ages for our glory.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.261
None of the rulers of this age
understood this,

00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:33.781
for if they had they would not
have crucified the Lord of

00:07:33.781 --> 00:07:34.410
glory.
 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:39.610
Now Paul knows that the Romans
crucified Jesus.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.452
Crucifixion is not a Jewish
punishment, that would be

00:07:42.452 --> 00:07:43.000
stoning.
 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.245
So when the Jewish leaders
wanted to punish somebody with

00:07:46.245 --> 00:07:49.781
death in Jerusalem they got a
mob together and they stoned the

00:07:49.781 --> 00:07:50.420
person.
 

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.879
Stoning was the Jewish means of
capital punishment;

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:56.678
crucifixion was the Roman means
of capital punishment,

00:07:56.678 --> 00:07:57.839
and Paul knows this.
 

00:07:57.839 --> 00:08:02.589
Is he here talking about these
authorities who crucified Jesus,

00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:04.199
that is the Romans?
 

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:07.723
Pilate obviously is the
governor of Judea at the time,

00:08:07.723 --> 00:08:11.514
but Pilate was simply the
representative of the Senate and

00:08:11.514 --> 00:08:12.579
the emperor.
 

00:08:12.579 --> 00:08:16.857
Is Paul blaming the Senate and
the Emperor for the crucifixion

00:08:16.857 --> 00:08:17.980
of Jesus here?
 

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.620
What does he mean by rulers?
 

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.370
You have some scholars who use
this text to say,

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.139
well even in spite of what Paul
says in Romans 13,

00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:28.509
Paul doesn't have any great
love in his heart for Rome.

00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:33.250
He still believes that they are
evil powers who crucified Jesus;

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.678
they're in the process of
perishing as we speak,

00:08:36.678 --> 00:08:39.239
and they will certainly be
destroyed by God when Jesus

00:08:39.239 --> 00:08:41.750
comes back on the clouds with
his holy angel army.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.626
Other scholars say no,
the word here for

00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:50.500
"ruler,"
archon in the Greek,

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.970
could refer to superhuman
angelic kinds of powers,

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.269
what we would call supernatural
powers.

00:08:57.269 --> 00:09:04.269
Is Paul talking here about sort
of satanic angelic powers that

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:06.450
ruled the cosmos?
 

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.408
Because remember we talked
about apocalyptic world view,

00:09:09.408 --> 00:09:12.537
and one of the aspects of an
apocalyptic world view is that

00:09:12.537 --> 00:09:15.178
different countries have these
angelic forces,

00:09:15.178 --> 00:09:18.624
these angelic leaders that are
the true power behind their

00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:20.759
government,
behind their nation.

00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:25.509
In Daniel we've got the Prince
of Persia is understood as this

00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:27.379
angel who runs Persia.
 

00:09:27.379 --> 00:09:32.105
Every nation has these angelic
powers or satanic powers,

00:09:32.105 --> 00:09:37.004
because of course Satan is
himself depicted as an angel in

00:09:37.004 --> 00:09:38.808
the Jewish Bible.
 

00:09:38.808 --> 00:09:43.374
So is Satan just one of many
kinds of powers like this or

00:09:43.374 --> 00:09:47.306
rulers of the cosmos,
and is Paul actually talking

00:09:47.306 --> 00:09:51.681
angelic superhuman powers here
that crucified Jesus rather than

00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:52.668
the Romans?
 

00:09:52.668 --> 00:09:56.993
Or, as some scholars would say,
and I'm in this last camp,

00:09:56.993 --> 00:09:59.418
maybe he's talking about both.
 

00:09:59.418 --> 00:10:03.717
Maybe Paul is including the
Romans in these rulers who

00:10:03.717 --> 00:10:08.178
ignorantly crucified Jesus and
so will be destroyed,

00:10:08.178 --> 00:10:12.684
but maybe Paul also believes
that the Romans are themselves

00:10:12.684 --> 00:10:16.570
controlled by superhuman satanic
angelic powers.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.129
If that's how you read I
Corinthians 2,

00:10:19.129 --> 00:10:22.519
then Paul's view of Rome isn't
quite as positive,

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:25.331
just straight forwardly
positive, as you would get from

00:10:25.331 --> 00:10:26.899
Romans 13,
right?

00:10:26.899 --> 00:10:32.085
When you ask scholars this
question, is early Christianity

00:10:32.085 --> 00:10:36.269
politically revolutionary
against Rome or is it

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:39.000
politically accommodating?
 

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.820
You're going to get scholars
lining up on both sides of this.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.381
Some of them say,
no, they read early

00:10:43.381 --> 00:10:46.158
Christianity for the most part
as revolutionary and anti-Rome.

00:10:46.158 --> 00:10:48.158
Others say, no,
it was accommodating;

00:10:48.158 --> 00:10:49.980
they were fairly conservative
and comfortable.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.644
We assign this topic for your
papers this week because this is

00:10:53.644 --> 00:10:57.488
actually something where there's
a live debate that goes on among

00:10:57.488 --> 00:10:58.928
scholars themselves.
 

00:10:58.928 --> 00:11:01.620
There's not one correct answer
to this question.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.668
It's complicated,
and so it's a good thing for

00:11:04.668 --> 00:11:05.820
you to look at.
 

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.567
Of course we've already read
Luke and Acts,

00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:08.960
too.
 

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.153
In Luke and Acts that author
seems to present Rome in kind of

00:11:13.153 --> 00:11:14.970
a strange ambiguous way.
 

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.601
On the one hand,
the author goes out of his way

00:11:17.601 --> 00:11:21.035
to have Roman governor after
Roman governor say that Jesus is

00:11:21.035 --> 00:11:21.778
innocent.
 

00:11:21.778 --> 00:11:24.124
Paul is innocent,
this movement is innocent,

00:11:24.124 --> 00:11:25.870
and they're not revolutionary.
 

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:29.356
Paul is eventually taken to
Rome, but it's after the

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:31.667
governor said,
well I could release him,

00:11:31.667 --> 00:11:33.779
I don't see anything that this
guy has done,

00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:35.019
it's just a dispute among Jews.
 

00:11:35.019 --> 00:11:38.758
Yet Paul appeals to the
emperor, so he is sent to Rome

00:11:38.758 --> 00:11:40.308
in the Book of Acts.
 

00:11:40.308 --> 00:11:45.027
All these Roman governors
declare that Christianity is not

00:11:45.027 --> 00:11:47.509
politically insurrectionist.
 

00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:50.573
It looks like the author is
actually writing almost a more

00:11:50.573 --> 00:11:52.509
apologetic book about the
Romans,

00:11:52.509 --> 00:11:54.243
except in that,
and as other people have

00:11:54.243 --> 00:11:56.568
pointed out,
all of these Roman rulers come

00:11:56.568 --> 00:11:59.279
across looking like they're
rather incompetent and

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:00.000
powerless.
 

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.947
They almost can't seem to
control the mobs that are around

00:12:02.947 --> 00:12:03.308
them.
 

00:12:03.308 --> 00:12:06.721
They can't seem to really
resist the Jewish leaders who

00:12:06.721 --> 00:12:09.690
want to accuse Paul of being
insurrectionist.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.855
So is Rome presented in the
Book of Acts,

00:12:13.855 --> 00:12:19.480
and the Gospel of Luke,
as a good force or a bad force,

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.190
or an ambiguous force?
 

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:28.788
Now what we've got is the
documents we're going to look at

00:12:28.788 --> 00:12:29.600
here.
 

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.000
First let's look at 2
Thessalonians.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.667
We've looked already at some of
these documents that seem

00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:39.399
clearly to be anti-Rome such as
the Book of Revelation.

00:12:39.399 --> 00:12:43.892
2 Thessalonians is one of these
letters of Paul that some

00:12:43.892 --> 00:12:48.865
scholars believe Paul actually
wrote and other scholars believe

00:12:48.865 --> 00:12:50.548
he did not write.
 

00:12:50.548 --> 00:12:53.774
I tend to be in the camp that
said he probably did not write 2

00:12:53.774 --> 00:12:54.620
Thessalonians.
 

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.929
But unlike Ephesians and
Colossians and the Pastoral

00:12:57.929 --> 00:13:00.344
Epistles,
where it's much clearer that

00:13:00.344 --> 00:13:03.496
they're written in a very
different style of Greek than

00:13:03.496 --> 00:13:07.543
Paul's seven undisputed letters,
the Greek of 2 Thessalonians

00:13:07.543 --> 00:13:10.740
actually looks pretty much like
Paul's Greek.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.538
So you can't throw 2
Thessalonians out of the

00:13:13.538 --> 00:13:17.167
authentic Epistles of Paul on
the basis of the Greek style

00:13:17.167 --> 00:13:21.048
like we can I think some of the
other letters that claim to be

00:13:21.048 --> 00:13:21.940
by Paul.
 

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.171
Why is it that I say I don't
think 2 Thessalonians is by

00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:26.710
Paul?
 

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.379
Well, for one thing,
this is not so important,

00:13:29.379 --> 00:13:32.304
but we'll get to it a minute,
he actually has a message in 2

00:13:32.304 --> 00:13:34.884
Thessalonians about the coming
of Jesus that seems to

00:13:34.884 --> 00:13:37.759
contradict what he had been
saying in 1 Thessalonians.

00:13:37.759 --> 00:13:40.629
In 1 Thessalonians he says,
it's coming very soon,

00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:44.600
get ready, don't go to sleep,
Jesus is coming back,

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.058
and the parousia will
happen--

00:13:46.058 --> 00:13:47.250
is all going to happen very
soon.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.730
He says, now we don't know
exactly when it's going to

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.830
happen but it's going to happen
very soon.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.761
In 2 Thessalonians,
as we'll see,

00:13:53.761 --> 00:13:56.422
he actually says,
no, no, no, no don't quit work

00:13:56.422 --> 00:13:58.595
or anything,
don't quit your day job,

00:13:58.595 --> 00:14:01.399
because some of the people in
Thessalonica,

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:03.902
according to this author,
seem to have quit their jobs

00:14:03.902 --> 00:14:06.500
because they're ready for Jesus
to come back so soon.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.408
He says, no,
no you should still be working,

00:14:08.408 --> 00:14:11.623
there are going to be a few
things that will happen first

00:14:11.623 --> 00:14:14.263
before the end comes,
and then he lays out a timeline

00:14:14.263 --> 00:14:15.690
of what he's expecting to
happen,

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.788
and I'm going to walk you
through that timeline in a

00:14:17.788 --> 00:14:18.158
minute.
 

00:14:18.158 --> 00:14:21.809
Some scholars have said what 2
Thessalonians teaches about the

00:14:21.809 --> 00:14:25.461
end time and the coming back of
Jesus differs enough from what

00:14:25.461 --> 00:14:29.231
Paul had actually said about it
in 1 Thessalonians that it might

00:14:29.231 --> 00:14:32.583
be written by a different person
at a different time in a

00:14:32.583 --> 00:14:34.259
different situation.
 

00:14:34.259 --> 00:14:35.710
That's one argument.
 

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.500
I think the more convincing
argument,

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:43.206
to me, is if you take the
beginning of 2 Thessalonians and

00:14:43.206 --> 00:14:48.967
the end of 2 Thessalonians,
and put them side by side with

00:14:48.967 --> 00:14:52.830
parts of 1 Thessalonians they
look very,

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:54.940
very much alike.
 

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.152
Now wait a minute,
they look alike,

00:14:57.152 --> 00:14:59.950
so that means they're
not by Paul?

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.028
This is what I'm thinking.
 

00:15:02.028 --> 00:15:06.370
If Paul is going to sit down
and write another letter to 2

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:10.330
Thessalonians is he going to do
so with the copy of 1

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.918
Thessalonians in front of him?
 

00:15:12.918 --> 00:15:15.783
Is he going to do so even
recalling the same words and

00:15:15.783 --> 00:15:18.269
phrases that he used in the
previous letter?

00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:19.840
I don't think so.
 

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.683
In other words,
I think 2 Thessalonians,

00:15:22.683 --> 00:15:26.621
in certain parts of it,
look suspiciously too much like

00:15:26.621 --> 00:15:30.558
1 Thessalonians to be an
authentic letter by Paul.

00:15:30.558 --> 00:15:33.102
Because when people write
another letter they use

00:15:33.102 --> 00:15:35.880
different words,
you don't sit down and

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:40.230
basically repeat words and
phrases and things from your

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.759
previous letter.
 

00:15:41.759 --> 00:15:45.307
The one place where you don't
find those words and phrases

00:15:45.307 --> 00:15:48.606
being the same is precisely in
the second chapter of 2

00:15:48.606 --> 00:15:50.993
Thessalonians,
that middle part,

00:15:50.993 --> 00:15:55.383
where this author is teaching a
different time line for the end

00:15:55.383 --> 00:15:57.720
time than 1 Thessalonians had.
 

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.469
In my mind I'm thinking okay if
you want to write a pseudonymous

00:16:01.469 --> 00:16:05.100
letter and claim to be Paul,
how do you make it convincing?

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.692
Well if you knew 1
Thessalonians as a letter you

00:16:07.692 --> 00:16:09.788
might actually take that as a
model.

00:16:09.788 --> 00:16:13.461
Read 1 Thessalonians carefully
and imitate the style and

00:16:13.461 --> 00:16:16.544
imitate even what's said,
but then you stick in the

00:16:16.544 --> 00:16:18.830
second chapter of 2
Thessalonians where you give

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.649
your own timeline to what you
think is going to happen.

00:16:21.649 --> 00:16:24.360
That's why I think it's
probably not by Paul.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.735
But scholars kind of divide up
on 2 Thessalonians in a lot of

00:16:27.735 --> 00:16:29.491
different ways,
with many scholars,

00:16:29.491 --> 00:16:31.759
even critical scholars who
don't believe Paul wrote all the

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:33.870
letters that are in his name in
the New Testament,

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.336
and they'll say they still
think Paul did write 2

00:16:36.336 --> 00:16:37.158
Thessalonians.
 

00:16:37.158 --> 00:16:41.868
Now what's the goal of writing
and let's look at the chapter 2,

00:16:41.868 --> 00:16:44.830
the first twelve verses of
chapter 2.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.644
Now read along with me so
you'll know I'm not lying to

00:16:47.644 --> 00:16:50.990
you, because every time I get a
chance I like to lie to students

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:52.320
and lead them astray.
 

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.960
As to the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ,

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.149
and our being gathered together
to him,

00:16:58.149 --> 00:17:01.880
we beg you brothers [again,
it doesn't say sisters in the

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.680
original Greek]
not to be quickly shaken in

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.682
mind or alarmed,
either by spirit or by word,

00:17:07.682 --> 00:17:11.057
or by letter as though from us
to the effect that the day of

00:17:11.057 --> 00:17:12.660
the Lord is already here.
 

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.876
He's mentioning there may have
been a letter circulated in

00:17:15.876 --> 00:17:18.868
Paul's name claiming that the
resurrection has already

00:17:18.868 --> 00:17:20.740
happened,
the day of the Lord has already

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:20.950
come.
 

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.544
Notice how if this letter is
pseudonymous as I claim,

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:28.000
there's a reference to a
pseudonymous letter in the

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.660
pseudonymous letter.
 

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:33.890
That's actually not unusual in
the ancient world.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.426
Sometimes if you're writing a
pseudonymous letter you'll put a

00:17:36.426 --> 00:17:38.719
reference saying,
well now some people have been

00:17:38.719 --> 00:17:41.930
circulating pseudonymous letters
by me and I condemn them for it.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.950
Of course it's in a letter that
probably itself is pseudonymous.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.328
That's an irony we see in some
of these ancient letters.

00:17:48.328 --> 00:17:51.490
Let no one deceive you in any
way.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:55.586
For that day will not come
unless the rebellion comes first

00:17:55.586 --> 00:17:59.460
and the lawless one is revealed,
[Okay, the lawless one,

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.506
what's he talking about here?]
the one destined for

00:18:02.506 --> 00:18:03.420
destruction.
 

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:07.135
He opposes and exalts himself
above every so-called god or

00:18:07.135 --> 00:18:10.981
object of worship so that he
takes his seat in the temple of

00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:13.328
God declaring himself to be God.
 

00:18:13.328 --> 00:18:17.461
This is something like another
sort of antichrist figure that

00:18:17.461 --> 00:18:19.940
we've seen in the Book of
Daniel,

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.220
Jesus and his own little
apocalypse in Mark 13,

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.123
and other places talk about the
abomination of desolation being

00:18:26.123 --> 00:18:27.200
set up in the temple.
 

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.969
This author is saying this
person is going to call himself

00:18:31.969 --> 00:18:36.318
God and set himself up in the
temple in Jerusalem.

00:18:36.318 --> 00:18:39.057
Do you not remember that I told
you these things when I was

00:18:39.057 --> 00:18:39.858
still with you?
 

00:18:39.858 --> 00:18:43.461
And you know what is now
restraining him so that he may

00:18:43.461 --> 00:18:45.730
be revealed when his time comes.
 

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:48.846
The thing restraining him comes
from one Greek word,

00:18:48.846 --> 00:18:51.597
katecho,
and it means something holding

00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:54.348
back or something holding back
something.

00:18:54.348 --> 00:18:58.799
We can't tell necessarily here
whether this is talking about a

00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:00.990
thing, a power,
or a person.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:06.244
Is there a person who's keeping
this guy back in the wings,

00:19:06.244 --> 00:19:11.681
who's not letting this divine
self-promoter set himself up in

00:19:11.681 --> 00:19:12.950
Jerusalem?
 

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:15.866
"For the mystery of
lawlessness is already at work,

00:19:15.866 --> 00:19:19.048
but only until the one who now
restrains is removed."

00:19:19.048 --> 00:19:23.930
This restraining force or
restraining thing,

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:27.906
or restraining person is at
some point going to be removed

00:19:27.906 --> 00:19:31.814
from the political scene and
then this other character is

00:19:31.814 --> 00:19:33.279
going to come in.
 

00:19:33.279 --> 00:19:37.981
And then the lawless one will
be revealed whom the Lord Jesus

00:19:37.981 --> 00:19:41.509
will destroy with the breath of
his mouth,

00:19:41.509 --> 00:19:44.400
annihilating him by the
manifestation of his coming.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.454
The coming of the lawless one
is apparent in the working of

00:19:47.454 --> 00:19:49.087
Satan,
who uses all power,

00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:51.842
signs, lying wonders,
every kind of wicked deception

00:19:51.842 --> 00:19:54.501
for those who are perishing
because they refused to love the

00:19:54.501 --> 00:19:55.630
truth and so be saved.
 

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.796
For this reason,
God sends them a powerful

00:19:57.796 --> 00:19:59.920
delusion,
leading them to believe what is

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.564
false so that all who have not
believed the truth but to

00:20:02.564 --> 00:20:04.920
pleasure in unrighteousness will
be condemned.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.930
What's going on here?
 

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:11.519
Well, to some extent your guess
is as good as mine,

00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:13.792
except that I know a bit more
about ancient Jewish

00:20:13.792 --> 00:20:16.837
apocalyptic,
and so I have a few resources

00:20:16.837 --> 00:20:17.808
to draw on.
 

00:20:17.808 --> 00:20:19.991
For one thing,
though, I think what's going on

00:20:19.991 --> 00:20:22.806
here is this author is referring
to some kind of antichrist

00:20:22.806 --> 00:20:23.338
figure.
 

00:20:23.338 --> 00:20:26.505
He doesn't use the term here
but he's clearly saying this is

00:20:26.505 --> 00:20:29.348
someone who's setting himself up
as divine as God,

00:20:29.348 --> 00:20:31.420
he's going to take a seat in
the temple in Jerusalem,

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.700
and he's going to proclaim
himself to be God,

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.170
or perhaps he's also referring
to a messianic pretender.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:40.718
Maybe he's thinking that this
will be another Messiah,

00:20:40.718 --> 00:20:44.200
a false Messiah of sorts,
that is, the antichrist.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.798
If that's true then what was he
imaging going on?

00:20:48.798 --> 00:20:50.848
I think what he's doing,
and this is my speculation,

00:20:50.848 --> 00:20:55.423
I think he's actually imagining
a Jewish false messiah that's

00:20:55.423 --> 00:20:58.212
somewhere hidden,
he knows not where,

00:20:58.212 --> 00:21:01.934
there's some guy somewhere in
Palestine or someplace else

00:21:01.934 --> 00:21:06.323
who's hiding in the wings,
waiting for the moment when he

00:21:06.323 --> 00:21:09.580
can come out,
declare himself as the messiah,

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:13.702
and enter the Jerusalem temple
and set himself up as the divine

00:21:13.702 --> 00:21:14.900
messiah figure.
 

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.740
If so, what's keeping him from
doing it now?

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.884
Well maybe it's just some
supernatural force,

00:21:20.884 --> 00:21:23.320
maybe it's even God,
and maybe God has just decided

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.318
it's not yet time for this to
happen.

00:21:25.318 --> 00:21:29.040
What if the thing that's
keeping him from doing it now is

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.568
precisely the Romans?
 

00:21:30.568 --> 00:21:33.760
In other words,
the force that's keeping any

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.140
Jewish messiah figure down now
would be the Roman Empire.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.750
They're not allowing kings,
look what they did with Jesus.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:44.607
They also executed other
messiah figures in the first

00:21:44.607 --> 00:21:45.348
century.
 

00:21:45.348 --> 00:21:48.740
The author therefore sees the
Roman emperor at work,

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.807
and the Roman Empire,
and that's the thing

00:21:51.807 --> 00:21:55.771
restraining this false messiah
from setting up shop in

00:21:55.771 --> 00:21:56.818
Jerusalem.
 

00:21:56.818 --> 00:21:59.740
But he says,
that's going to be taken away.

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.759
How is that going to happen?
 

00:22:01.759 --> 00:22:03.098
Again we don't know.
 

00:22:03.098 --> 00:22:05.674
But in my mind,
it's the idea that somehow the

00:22:05.674 --> 00:22:09.108
Roman emperor is going to be
moved out of the way by God when

00:22:09.108 --> 00:22:11.568
the time comes for this all to
happen,

00:22:11.568 --> 00:22:14.535
and then this Jewish messiah
will set himself up and then

00:22:14.535 --> 00:22:16.763
Jesus will come in,
destroy the false messiah,

00:22:16.763 --> 00:22:19.220
and that's when we'll have the
setting up of the real Kingdom

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:19.630
of God.
 

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:22.046
Now, as I said,
that's speculation,

00:22:22.046 --> 00:22:26.025
but what I'm doing is saying,
what kind of scenario is he

00:22:26.025 --> 00:22:27.660
possibly imagining?
 

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.300
The reason I do this little
scenario is because what would

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:35.006
be this guy's view of Rome and
the relationship between the

00:22:35.006 --> 00:22:38.000
Christian movement,
the Jesus movement, and Rome?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.750
If my little scenario is right,
he doesn't see Rome as simply a

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.720
wholeheartedly negative thing.
 

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.608
Rome actually has a purpose in
God's plan.

00:22:49.608 --> 00:22:53.233
Rome's purpose is to keep back
this false Jewish messiah from

00:22:53.233 --> 00:22:56.433
appearing,
and then when that purpose is

00:22:56.433 --> 00:23:01.597
done God will remove the Roman
Empire from being a geopolitical

00:23:01.597 --> 00:23:05.595
force and then the real
beginning of the end time

00:23:05.595 --> 00:23:09.930
schedule will kick into gear,
and Jesus will come through,

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.628
destroy this lawless one,
the false messiah,

00:23:12.628 --> 00:23:15.876
also destroy the Romans,
perhaps, and set up the Kingdom

00:23:15.876 --> 00:23:16.220
of God.
 

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:20.548
What that does is that gives us
another look at what an author

00:23:20.548 --> 00:23:22.818
may have conceived Rome to be.
 

00:23:22.818 --> 00:23:26.890
It's not nearly as negative as
the Revelation author.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.892
It may not also be completely
positive either because he still

00:23:30.892 --> 00:23:34.368
sees Rome apparently as being
destroyed in the end.

00:23:34.368 --> 00:23:38.316
2 Thessalonians,
therefore, looks like a case

00:23:38.316 --> 00:23:42.890
where someone's writing a letter
in Paul's name,

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:47.160
precisely to counter the idea
that Jesus is coming back

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.029
tomorrow.
 

00:23:48.029 --> 00:23:51.135
Because he believes you have to
have a certain number of things

00:23:51.135 --> 00:23:52.490
that are going to happen.
 

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.200
It still is fairly soon in the
future,

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.460
he's not expecting a thousand
years or anything like that,

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.525
but he seems to believe that
there's going to be a timeline

00:24:00.525 --> 00:24:03.960
of geopolitical events that take
place before Jesus comes back.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.170
So that's II Thessalonians.
 

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:10.217
Any questions,
comments, or outbursts about

00:24:10.217 --> 00:24:12.529
that before I move on?
 

00:24:12.529 --> 00:24:13.970
Yes sir.
 

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:16.614
Student:  Is it possible
that given the cult of the Roman

00:24:16.614 --> 00:24:19.048
emperor he might be referring to
the Roman emperor here?

00:24:19.048 --> 00:24:20.935
Prof: That he might be
referring to the Roman Emperor

00:24:20.935 --> 00:24:21.160
here?
 

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.338
It could be.
 

00:24:22.338 --> 00:24:25.970
In fact that's possibly the way
some things have been set up.

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.445
The reason I don't think it's
the Roman Emperor here is

00:24:28.445 --> 00:24:31.105
because he talks about this
character as if he's hidden for

00:24:31.105 --> 00:24:34.467
the moment,
it's a mystery and he's not

00:24:34.467 --> 00:24:35.440
revealed.
 

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.854
The Roman emperor,
you could have never said here

00:24:37.854 --> 00:24:38.808
was not revealed.
 

00:24:38.808 --> 00:24:41.576
The Roman emperor was visible
everywhere you looked in the

00:24:41.576 --> 00:24:43.420
Mediterranean at the time:
statues,

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.396
inscriptions,
temples so I think he's

00:24:45.396 --> 00:24:48.803
probably not talking about the
Roman emperor as the lawless one

00:24:48.803 --> 00:24:51.880
because the Roman Emperor wasn't
hidden at the time.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.858
Any other questions?
 

00:24:55.858 --> 00:24:59.038
Now, though,
let's look at 1 Peter.

00:24:59.038 --> 00:25:02.690
So we're going to another
little text that's asking again

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:05.565
the same question,
what is the politics of the

00:25:05.565 --> 00:25:08.180
early Christian movement,
the early Jesus movement?

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:15.565
Most of us scholars don't
believe Peter actually wrote 1

00:25:15.565 --> 00:25:16.640
Peter.
 

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.212
The reasons are,
again, numerous,

00:25:19.212 --> 00:25:22.670
and, notice,
this is not an anonymous letter

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:27.334
like the letters of John are
that don't claim to be written

00:25:27.334 --> 00:25:28.460
by John.
 

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.577
This one actually claims to be
written by Peter the Apostle,

00:25:31.577 --> 00:25:32.528
as does 2 Peter.
 

00:25:32.528 --> 00:25:35.148
Why do we think Peter,
the actual apostle,

00:25:35.148 --> 00:25:36.298
didn't write it?
 

00:25:36.298 --> 00:25:40.255
Well for one thing Peter was,
even as the New Testament

00:25:40.255 --> 00:25:44.210
several times lets us know,
an illiterate fisherman.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:47.048
He probably couldn't read or
write.

00:25:47.048 --> 00:25:50.746
If he could read or write it's
almost certain that he couldn't

00:25:50.746 --> 00:25:54.382
read or write Greek at the level
of Greek that this letter is

00:25:54.382 --> 00:25:55.108
written.
 

00:25:55.108 --> 00:25:58.241
There are all those things in
the letter that make us think

00:25:58.241 --> 00:26:00.835
that it looks like a
Christianity in a little bit

00:26:00.835 --> 00:26:04.130
later stage than the very
primitive area of Christianity.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:06.627
The development of doctrine,
the development of the notions

00:26:06.627 --> 00:26:09.556
of Peter himself,
the idea that certain theology

00:26:09.556 --> 00:26:13.894
of the letter seem to look later
than the most primitive time of

00:26:13.894 --> 00:26:15.410
early Christianity.
 

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:18.932
Most of us would just,
say simply on the basis of the

00:26:18.932 --> 00:26:21.574
language itself,
we don't believe Peter,

00:26:21.574 --> 00:26:24.420
the actual Apostle,
wrote this letter.

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:28.348
Look what he's writing,
he says:

00:26:28.348 --> 00:26:31.861
Peter an Apostle of Jesus
Christ to the exiles of the

00:26:31.861 --> 00:26:34.696
dispersion in Pontius,
Galatia, Cappadocia,

00:26:34.696 --> 00:26:36.250
Asia, and Bithynia.
 

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:38.875
Again he's writing too--he
calls them exiles of the

00:26:38.875 --> 00:26:42.025
dispersion, so some people might
think, well, he's talking to

00:26:42.025 --> 00:26:43.808
Jews then, the dispersed Jews.
 

00:26:43.808 --> 00:26:47.170
But he's clearly including
Gentile Christians in this too,

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:51.368
so he's talking about followers
of Jesus who live in all this

00:26:51.368 --> 00:26:55.448
different geographical area,
and again, this is sort of what

00:26:55.448 --> 00:26:58.660
we would now call Turkey,
the area of Turkey.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.419
Both Asia Minor,
which proper was just the

00:27:01.419 --> 00:27:04.917
western side of Turkey,
but pretty much all that area

00:27:04.917 --> 00:27:06.868
that occupies Turkey now.
 

00:27:06.868 --> 00:27:09.590
He calls them exiles,
though, and I don't think he's

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.259
talking about this in an actual
political sense.

00:27:12.259 --> 00:27:15.535
He's spiritualizing the notion
that followers of Jesus are

00:27:15.535 --> 00:27:16.799
exiles in our world.
 

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:18.798
We don't belong here, he says.
 

00:27:18.798 --> 00:27:28.140
He says also in 1:17,
"If you invoke his father,

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.858
the one who judges all people
impartially according to these,

00:27:30.858 --> 00:27:34.088
live in reverent fear during
the time of your exile."

00:27:34.088 --> 00:27:36.558
Again, followers of Jesus are
exiles--

00:27:36.558 --> 00:27:40.699
2:11 "Beloved I urge you
as aliens and exiles to abstain

00:27:40.699 --> 00:27:44.424
from the desires of the flesh
that wage war against the

00:27:44.424 --> 00:27:45.460
soul."
 

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:48.778
These are Greek terms that
would have mean in the ancient

00:27:48.778 --> 00:27:52.155
context precisely what illegal
alien means in contemporary

00:27:52.155 --> 00:27:55.608
American context,
you're here illegally.

00:27:55.608 --> 00:27:58.269
All the followers of Jesus,
according to this writer,

00:27:58.269 --> 00:28:02.490
live in the Roman Empire as
illegal aliens basically,

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:04.910
or not illegal aliens but
definitely as aliens.

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:10.528
Maybe they're legal aliens but
they don't really belong.

00:28:10.528 --> 00:28:13.848
I said he's talking not just to
Jews, he says in 1:18:

00:28:13.848 --> 00:28:17.535
You know that you were ransomed
from the futile ways inherited

00:28:17.535 --> 00:28:20.980
from your ancestors not with
perishable things like silver

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.818
and gold with the precious blood
of Christ.

00:28:23.818 --> 00:28:27.688
The ancestors referred to here,
he's clearly referring to

00:28:27.688 --> 00:28:31.970
Gentiles who have come into the
church as Gentiles and then now

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.769
occupy their role as part of
this alien people too.

00:28:35.769 --> 00:28:38.509
Now what's this guy's politics?
 

00:28:38.509 --> 00:28:42.295
Look at 2:13:
"For the Lord's sake,

00:28:42.295 --> 00:28:47.730
accept the authority of every
human institution."

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:51.163
Now we're pretty clear that
authority here is not at least

00:28:51.163 --> 00:28:54.720
just referring to angelic type
supernatural authorities,

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.890
but he's referring to the human
rulers,

00:28:56.890 --> 00:29:02.368
"Whether of the emperor as
supreme or of governors,

00:29:02.368 --> 00:29:04.930
as sent by him to punish those
who do wrong,

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:06.500
and to praise those who do
right."

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.130
Of course the governors of the
different parts of the Roman

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:11.805
Empire were appointed either by
the Senate or by the emperor

00:29:11.805 --> 00:29:12.348
himself.
 

00:29:12.348 --> 00:29:16.210
This author is not too neat
about the actual politics of the

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:20.134
first century so he seems to
believe that all Roman governors

00:29:20.134 --> 00:29:24.028
are appointed by the emperor,
which was in fact not the case,

00:29:24.028 --> 00:29:26.329
but some of them were,
and many of them were appointed

00:29:26.329 --> 00:29:26.818
by the Senate.
 

00:29:26.818 --> 00:29:29.259
He doesn't care about those
kinds of niceties.

00:29:29.259 --> 00:29:33.189
For it is God's will that by
doing right you should silence

00:29:33.189 --> 00:29:35.288
the ignorance of the foolish.
 

00:29:35.288 --> 00:29:38.676
As servants of God live as free
people yet do not use your

00:29:38.676 --> 00:29:40.578
freedom as a pretext for evil.
 

00:29:40.578 --> 00:29:44.218
Honor everyone,
love the family of believers,

00:29:44.218 --> 00:29:46.700
fear God, honor the emperor.
 

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:51.009
Can you imagine the author of
Revelation saying that?

00:29:51.009 --> 00:29:55.759
It would have broken his jaw to
say "honor the

00:29:55.759 --> 00:29:57.279
emperor."
 

00:29:57.279 --> 00:29:59.586
He also doesn't seem to have a
whole lot of love for just

00:29:59.586 --> 00:30:00.410
people in general.
 

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:04.201
The Book of Revelation seems to
have a lot of loyalty for the

00:30:04.201 --> 00:30:07.579
people who are in the group,
but there seems to be a lot of

00:30:07.579 --> 00:30:10.088
despising for pretty much
anybody outside the group.

00:30:10.088 --> 00:30:15.180
That's the political
conservatism of 1 Peter,

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.893
he's writing a letter to
followers of Jesus who live

00:30:17.893 --> 00:30:21.085
throughout the area of Turkey,
and he's trying to get them to

00:30:21.085 --> 00:30:23.190
see that they don't really
belong to Rome,

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.715
they're not Romans,
and he doesn't address them as

00:30:25.715 --> 00:30:26.180
Romans.
 

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.315
They don't really belong to the
political situations they're

00:30:28.315 --> 00:30:28.750
living in.
 

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.680
They should see themselves as
aliens,

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.898
as exiles, and yet they should
see themselves as properly

00:30:34.898 --> 00:30:38.866
subservient,
honorable, well behaved exiles

00:30:38.866 --> 00:30:40.759
in a Roman context.
 

00:30:40.759 --> 00:30:45.895
That plays itself out also in
some of the other social justice

00:30:45.895 --> 00:30:48.759
issues in this,
in the politics.

00:30:48.759 --> 00:30:53.075
Look at 2:18 right where we
stopped, after he says honor the

00:30:53.075 --> 00:30:55.765
emperor:
Slaves accept the authority of

00:30:55.765 --> 00:30:57.838
your masters with all deference.
 

00:30:57.838 --> 00:31:00.397
Not only those who are kind and
gentle but also those who are

00:31:00.397 --> 00:31:00.740
harsh.
 

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:04.275
For it is a credit to you if
being aware of God you endure

00:31:04.275 --> 00:31:06.259
pain while suffering unjustly.
 

00:31:06.259 --> 00:31:08.780
If you endure when you are
beaten for doing wrong what

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:09.588
credit is that?
 

00:31:09.588 --> 00:31:12.423
If you endure when you do right
and suffer for it you have God's

00:31:12.423 --> 00:31:12.920
approval.
 

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.470
This is ideologically very
problematic.

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:18.967
Telling slaves,
just submit,

00:31:18.967 --> 00:31:23.868
and if you're being beaten
don't blame your master for

00:31:23.868 --> 00:31:26.828
beating you, just endure it.
 

00:31:26.828 --> 00:31:29.381
I mean, if you do wrong and
your master beats you then you

00:31:29.381 --> 00:31:31.950
deserve to get beaten,
but you should endure it even

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.450
when you get beaten for things
you don't deserve.

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:38.750
Talk about "the opiate of
the masses"!

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:43.666
This is precisely the kind of
religion that classical Marxism

00:31:43.666 --> 00:31:48.093
critiques: a religion that
exists to keep the slave the

00:31:48.093 --> 00:31:50.880
slave, to keep the poor,
poor;

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.759
to keep the downtrodden,
downtrodden.

00:31:52.759 --> 00:31:56.334
Part of the honoring of the
emperor is to teach slaves just

00:31:56.334 --> 00:31:59.601
to submit, and if you can't
enjoy it when you're being

00:31:59.601 --> 00:32:01.818
beaten, at least put up with it.
 

00:32:01.818 --> 00:32:04.313
Look at 3:1-7,
"Wives,

00:32:04.313 --> 00:32:08.436
in the same way except the
authority of your

00:32:08.436 --> 00:32:10.259
husbands."
 

00:32:10.259 --> 00:32:13.394
My mom used to always hate it
when they would read out these

00:32:13.394 --> 00:32:14.509
passages in church.
 

00:32:14.509 --> 00:32:18.327
We'd have a very loud
discussion of such passages over

00:32:18.327 --> 00:32:19.480
Sunday dinner.
 

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.269
Then, after this.
 

00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:24.118
Wives in the same except the
authority of your husband's so

00:32:24.118 --> 00:32:26.380
that even if some of them do not
obey word,

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.210
they may be won over without a
word by their wives conduct.

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:30.894
Some of these women are
followers of Jesus,

00:32:30.894 --> 00:32:32.538
and their husband's are not
Christians.

00:32:32.538 --> 00:32:35.058
They should still obey them
though he says,

00:32:35.058 --> 00:32:38.855
he doesn't allow women to use
their Christian allegiance and

00:32:38.855 --> 00:32:42.525
the Lordship of Christ over them
to get out from under the

00:32:42.525 --> 00:32:44.519
lordship of their husbands.
 

00:32:44.519 --> 00:32:47.890
Do not adorn yourselves
outwardly by braiding your hair,

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:50.710
by wearing gold ornaments,
or fine clothing.

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:53.286
Rather let your adornment be
the inner self with the lasting

00:32:53.286 --> 00:32:55.819
beauty of a gentle and quiet
spirit, which is very precious

00:32:55.819 --> 00:32:56.650
in God's sight.
 

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:59.098
My mom especially hated that
"gentle and quiet

00:32:59.098 --> 00:33:01.685
spirit" part;
she had no intentions of being

00:33:01.685 --> 00:33:03.400
a very gentle and quiet spirit.
 

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.667
"It was in this way long
ago that the holy women who

00:33:06.667 --> 00:33:09.761
hoped in God used to adorn
themselves by accepting the

00:33:09.761 --> 00:33:11.688
authority of their
husbands,"

00:33:11.688 --> 00:33:13.789
and then it goes on like that.
 

00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:17.223
Now look at 5:5:
In the same way you who are

00:33:17.223 --> 00:33:20.648
younger must accept the
authority of elders and all of

00:33:20.648 --> 00:33:24.590
you must clothe yourselves with
humility and the dealings with

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:25.690
one another.
 

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:28.588
For God opposes the proud but
gives grace to the humble.

00:33:28.588 --> 00:33:32.167
In all of this stuff,
this author is basically

00:33:32.167 --> 00:33:35.108
telling people,
stay in your place.

00:33:35.108 --> 00:33:37.030
No revolution,
no rebellion,

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:40.803
don't even resent the people
who are over you and have

00:33:40.803 --> 00:33:42.440
authority over you.
 

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:45.618
This is quite clearly political
quietism,

00:33:45.618 --> 00:33:52.186
political accommodation,
and one of the reasons he's

00:33:52.186 --> 00:33:55.701
doing this,
as scholars will point out,

00:33:55.701 --> 00:33:59.314
is that he seems to believe
that Christians can help their

00:33:59.314 --> 00:34:02.038
reputation if they don't rock
the boat,

00:34:02.038 --> 00:34:06.807
so you get verses like this,
2:12: "Conduct yourselves

00:34:06.807 --> 00:34:09.849
honorably among the
Gentiles."

00:34:09.849 --> 00:34:13.130
Now notice these are converted
Gentiles themselves,

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:15.172
but he doesn't call them
Gentiles because "the

00:34:15.172 --> 00:34:16.766
Gentiles"
is still a term for those

00:34:16.766 --> 00:34:18.360
people outside the body of
Christ,

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.349
outside of Christianity.
 

00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:22.059
Conduct yourselves honorably
among the Gentiles so that

00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:24.719
though they malign you as evil
doers they may see your

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:27.679
honorable deeds and glorify God
when he comes to judge.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:34.445
And in 3:15:
In your heart sanctify Christ

00:34:34.445 --> 00:34:36.231
as Lord,
always be ready to make your

00:34:36.231 --> 00:34:38.597
defense to anyone who demands
from you an accounting for the

00:34:38.597 --> 00:34:41.704
hope that is in,
yet do it with gentleness and

00:34:41.704 --> 00:34:42.579
reverence.
 

00:34:42.579 --> 00:34:46.929
He's basically very
conservative in his politics and

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:48.210
his ideology.
 

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:51.431
For one reason,
he wants these groups of

00:34:51.431 --> 00:34:56.139
followers of Jesus not to be
disrespected by outsiders.

00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:59.554
He wants them to develop a good
reputation so that they can't be

00:34:59.554 --> 00:35:03.079
persecuted, so that they can't
be opposed by local authorities.

00:35:03.079 --> 00:35:06.965
Here we have a clear case of a
totally different ideological

00:35:06.965 --> 00:35:10.719
take on early Christianity,
but it's still apocalyptic.

00:35:10.719 --> 00:35:11.670
This is what's interesting.
 

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:15.295
This author hasn't thrown away
the Christian apocalyptic that

00:35:15.295 --> 00:35:18.679
we saw working so much in
Revelation to be anti-Roman.

00:35:18.679 --> 00:35:19.719
He still has it.
 

00:35:19.719 --> 00:35:20.710
You can see places.
 

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:23.362
He says in 4:7,
"The end of all things is

00:35:23.362 --> 00:35:25.543
near," well that's
apocalyticism,

00:35:25.543 --> 00:35:26.960
and the end is near.
 

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.393
"Therefore be serious and
discipline yourselves for the

00:35:29.393 --> 00:35:30.590
sake of your prayers."
 

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:34.860
In 4:12:
Beloved do not be surprised by

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.728
the fiery ordeal that is taking
place among you to test you as

00:35:37.728 --> 00:35:40.079
though something strange were
happening to you.

00:35:40.079 --> 00:35:43.552
Any suffering that you have,
he says, chalk it up to the

00:35:43.552 --> 00:35:46.456
suffering that comes with the
apocalyptic fire,

00:35:46.456 --> 00:35:49.360
this is testing you,
again just endure it.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.974
In 4:17:
For the time has come for

00:35:51.974 --> 00:35:54.190
judgment to begin with the
household of God,

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:56.864
if it begins with us what will
be the end for those who do not

00:35:56.864 --> 00:35:57.960
obey the Gospel of God?
 

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.449
He does believe that the people
who are persecuting them now,

00:36:01.449 --> 00:36:03.565
or dissing them now,
I'm not so sure that sometimes

00:36:03.565 --> 00:36:05.724
it was actual physical
persecution these communities

00:36:05.724 --> 00:36:07.751
were enduring,
he may just believe that

00:36:07.751 --> 00:36:10.293
they're being disrespected,
that they're being

00:36:10.293 --> 00:36:12.360
discriminated against in some
way.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.860
But his solution to this is for
them not to rock the boat,

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.030
not to rebel,
not to fight back,

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:21.320
but actually to just be good
boys and girls,

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:24.016
be submissive slaves,
be submissive women to your

00:36:24.016 --> 00:36:25.963
husbands,
and then, if possible,

00:36:25.963 --> 00:36:29.552
people will see your submission
and it'll make them respect the

00:36:29.552 --> 00:36:31.000
message of the Gospel.
 

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.181
If not, those people will be
destroyed, but we have to endure

00:36:34.181 --> 00:36:36.409
our own punishment and serving
now also.

00:36:36.409 --> 00:36:39.907
The apocalyptic material there
serves a different purpose than

00:36:39.907 --> 00:36:43.579
it did in Revelation and some
other Christian and Jewish text.

00:36:43.579 --> 00:36:48.199
It's not particularly to
explain your suffering,

00:36:48.199 --> 00:36:51.108
it's just there to be endured,
and it's just there because

00:36:51.108 --> 00:36:53.610
it's part of the message of
early Christianity.

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:56.786
It doesn't really help fight
against injustice in any way,

00:36:56.786 --> 00:36:59.630
as you might be able to see it
do in other texts.

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:02.059
Now how does this happen in 2
Peter?

00:37:02.059 --> 00:37:04.976
We'll just look at this briefly
because we're almost out of

00:37:04.976 --> 00:37:07.289
time, but I want to show you one
more thing.

00:37:07.289 --> 00:37:09.289
I believe 2 Peter was written
by someone else,

00:37:09.289 --> 00:37:12.030
not Peter again,
for some of the same reasons,

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.568
but I also believe it was not
written by the same person who

00:37:14.568 --> 00:37:16.550
wrote 1 Peter because it's
rather different.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:20.182
In fact, I believe 2 Peter was
written sometime in the second

00:37:20.182 --> 00:37:22.431
century,
maybe even decades after the

00:37:22.431 --> 00:37:25.987
letters of Paul and the Book of
Revelation and these others were

00:37:25.987 --> 00:37:26.610
written.
 

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:29.297
It seems to me to show a
different stage in the

00:37:29.297 --> 00:37:31.050
development of Christianity.
 

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:33.722
Christianity now looks
different in the second century

00:37:33.722 --> 00:37:35.539
than it did in the first
century,

00:37:35.539 --> 00:37:38.445
and I'll walk you through this
and show why I say that and how

00:37:38.445 --> 00:37:38.969
it works.
 

00:37:38.969 --> 00:37:42.099
First look at 2 Peter 3:2.
 

00:37:42.099 --> 00:37:45.599
We'll start reading right at
the beginning of chapter 3.

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:49.000
This is now beloved the second
letter I am writing to you.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.193
[He seems to know about the
existence of the first letter of

00:37:52.193 --> 00:37:54.143
Peter.]
In them I am trying to arouse

00:37:54.143 --> 00:37:57.231
your sincere intention by
reminding you so that you should

00:37:57.231 --> 00:38:00.534
remember the words spoken in the
past by the holy prophets and

00:38:00.534 --> 00:38:03.621
the commandment of the Lord and
Savior spoken through your

00:38:03.621 --> 00:38:04.650
apostles.
 

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:10.280
This is already something like
a post-apostolic letter.

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:13.445
He's harkening back to the
beginning of the Christian

00:38:13.445 --> 00:38:16.429
movement when there were
prophets and apostles.

00:38:16.429 --> 00:38:19.072
Even though he's setting
himself up as Peter the Apostle

00:38:19.072 --> 00:38:21.981
in the letter,
the tone of the letter makes it

00:38:21.981 --> 00:38:26.097
sound like the apostolic era is
somewhere in the past for this

00:38:26.097 --> 00:38:29.539
guy's version of Christianity
for his community.

00:38:29.539 --> 00:38:33.420
We read 2 Peter as actually a
really good example of

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:36.389
post-apostolic New Testament
writing.

00:38:36.389 --> 00:38:38.710
He also has references to the
Gospels themselves.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:44.570
Look at 1:17,
I'll start reading at 1:16:

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:48.126
For we did not follow cleverly
devised myths when we made known

00:38:48.126 --> 00:38:51.340
to you the power and coming of
our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.260
but we had been eyewitnesses of
his majesty.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:57.670
For he received honor and glory
from God the Father when that

00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:00.969
voice was conveyed to him by the
majestic glory saying,

00:39:00.969 --> 00:39:02.010
"This is my Son,
my Beloved,

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:03.610
with whom I am well
pleased."

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:06.579
We ourselves heard this voice
come from heaven when we were

00:39:06.579 --> 00:39:08.219
with him on the holy mountain.
 

00:39:08.219 --> 00:39:09.659
What is he referring too?
 

00:39:09.659 --> 00:39:11.719
What's the event?
 

00:39:11.719 --> 00:39:12.860
Student:  The
transfiguration.

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.400
Prof: Exactly,
the transfiguration.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:17.610
He's read his Gospels,
at least one of them,

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:21.826
and he's harkening back to the
story of the transfiguration of

00:39:21.826 --> 00:39:25.489
Jesus on the mountain with Moses
and Elijah there,

00:39:25.489 --> 00:39:27.420
and of course who were the
apostles,

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.340
the disciples that were with
Jesus at the time?

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:31.842
Peter was one of them,
there were three of them,

00:39:31.842 --> 00:39:34.400
so Peter was there,
and he's recalling that scene

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.518
from the Gospels.
 

00:39:35.518 --> 00:39:38.367
There's reference to Gospel
traditions here,

00:39:38.367 --> 00:39:42.009
and he's even actually read
some written Gospels that we

00:39:42.009 --> 00:39:43.400
have in our text.
 

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:48.039
He also says something like a
reference to 1 Peter,

00:39:48.039 --> 00:39:49.779
as I already said that,
but he says I've already

00:39:49.779 --> 00:39:52.065
written to you once,
that could be a reference to 1

00:39:52.065 --> 00:39:52.400
Peter.
 

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.849
Then he talks about Paul's
letters, so he knows Paul's

00:39:55.849 --> 00:39:56.500
letters.
 

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.480
3:15.
 

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:05.244
Start reading at 3:14:
Therefore beloved while you are

00:40:05.244 --> 00:40:07.782
waiting for these things,
strive to be found by him at

00:40:07.782 --> 00:40:11.157
peace without spot or blemish
and regard the patience of our

00:40:11.157 --> 00:40:12.360
Lord as salvation.
 

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:16.570
So also our brother Paul wrote
to you according to the wisdom

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:20.710
given him speaking of this as he
does in all his letters.

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:23.304
There are some things in them,
hard to understand,

00:40:23.304 --> 00:40:26.532
which the ignorant and unstable
twist to their own destruction

00:40:26.532 --> 00:40:28.440
as they do the other scriptures.
 

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.559
You therefore, beloved ...
 

00:40:30.559 --> 00:40:32.440
So he goes on to admonish them.
 

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.097
Notice what he's doing,
he actually calls Paul's

00:40:35.097 --> 00:40:36.230
letters scripture.
 

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:39.760
Now Paul, when he was writing
his letters,

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.199
he thought he was writing
authoritative letters,

00:40:42.199 --> 00:40:45.248
but they were authoritative
because he was an apostle who

00:40:45.248 --> 00:40:46.719
had founded the churches.
 

00:40:46.719 --> 00:40:49.313
Most of the time he was writing
to churches he himself founded,

00:40:49.313 --> 00:40:51.570
so he felt like he had
authority over these churches to

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:52.909
write authoritative letters.
 

00:40:52.909 --> 00:40:55.059
But Paul didn't think he was
writing scripture.

00:40:55.059 --> 00:40:58.434
When Paul talks about scripture
in his letters he's talking

00:40:58.434 --> 00:41:01.460
about Jewish scripture,
the Greek translations of the

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:02.449
Hebrew Bible.
 

00:41:02.449 --> 00:41:05.427
This guy, though,
is far enough removed from

00:41:05.427 --> 00:41:09.445
Paul's own day that he can
actually refer to Paul's letters

00:41:09.445 --> 00:41:11.940
as themselves part of scripture.
 

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.800
That's one of the reasons we
think this took awhile to

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.340
develop.
 

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.010
You just don't have in early
Christianity,

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:21.170
the automatic acceptance of
Paul's occasional letters,

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:23.610
because they were letters
written to real situations,

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:27.820
being elevated now to the
status of holy writing,

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:28.809
scripture.
 

00:41:28.809 --> 00:41:32.552
This author is living now in a
post-apostolic age and a

00:41:32.552 --> 00:41:35.820
post-Pauline age,
and he obviously--he's probably

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.019
by this time--
they don't have a New Testament

00:41:38.019 --> 00:41:40.083
yet,
but probably by this time he's

00:41:40.083 --> 00:41:43.530
already familiar with maybe a
collection of Paul's letters

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:46.735
that are being circulated as
scripture among different

00:41:46.735 --> 00:41:48.429
churches in Asia Minor.
 

00:41:48.429 --> 00:41:51.327
He also may,
as I said, be familiar with

00:41:51.327 --> 00:41:55.340
some Gospels that are being
circulated as authoritative

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.719
texts in early Christianity.
 

00:41:57.719 --> 00:42:00.331
He's clearly living in a later
time, like I said,

00:42:00.331 --> 00:42:03.052
maybe in the second century,
when these things have

00:42:03.052 --> 00:42:03.760
happened.
 

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:07.130
Then one last thing that is
interesting to talk about,

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:12.403
keep your finger there in 2
Peter but we're going to look at

00:42:12.403 --> 00:42:15.197
Jude,
so flip over to Jude which is

00:42:15.197 --> 00:42:16.989
right before Revelation.
 

00:42:16.989 --> 00:42:23.590
Jude is a short little letter,
Jude 14,

00:42:28.559 --> 00:42:32.215
"It was also about
these," he's talking about

00:42:32.215 --> 00:42:34.789
evil angels or angels of some
sort,

00:42:34.789 --> 00:42:37.804
"that Enoch,"
remember Enoch is that

00:42:37.804 --> 00:42:40.936
character in the very,
very early part of Genesis who

00:42:40.936 --> 00:42:42.829
was only a few generations from
Adam,

00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:46.295
but there were apocalypses
written in Enoch's name and

00:42:46.295 --> 00:42:49.630
published just in the century or
so before this,

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:52.150
two or three centuries before
this.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:55.963
So we have different documents
called the Apocalypse of Enoch

00:42:55.963 --> 00:42:58.949
or the Revelations of Enoch,
or Enoch itself.

00:42:58.949 --> 00:43:02.750
Enoch, in the seventh
generation from Adam,

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.340
prophesied saying,
"See the Lord is coming

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:09.000
with ten thousand of his holy
ones to execute judgment on all,

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.077
and to convict everyone of the
deeds of ungodliness that they

00:43:12.077 --> 00:43:14.179
have committed in such an
ungodly way,

00:43:14.179 --> 00:43:16.932
and of all the harsh things
that ungodly sinners have spoken

00:43:16.932 --> 00:43:17.400
against.
 

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:21.467
Notice what he's doing,
he's quoting Enochic

00:43:21.467 --> 00:43:26.954
literature, which isn't in our
Bible, as if it is also true

00:43:26.954 --> 00:43:30.550
prophecy and scripture from
Enoch.

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:33.773
Now that's what Jude does,
it's important because he's

00:43:33.773 --> 00:43:35.659
having a debate about angels.
 

00:43:35.659 --> 00:43:38.949
Now look over at 2 Peter 2:10.
 

00:43:51.579 --> 00:43:56.614
I'm not going to read all of
this but if you read 2 Peter

00:43:56.614 --> 00:44:02.010
2:10-22, you have a bunch of
material that 2 Peter is getting

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:03.449
out of Jude.
 

00:44:03.449 --> 00:44:06.306
In other words,
the author of 2 Peter doesn't

00:44:06.306 --> 00:44:09.898
only know the letters of Paul,
he knows Jude also,

00:44:09.898 --> 00:44:12.489
and he's using Jude as a
source,

00:44:12.489 --> 00:44:14.590
and he copies some of that out.
 

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:18.336
What's interesting enough,
he takes out the quotation from

00:44:18.336 --> 00:44:20.309
Enoch, he doesn't have that.
 

00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:22.519
In other words,
he takes Jude as a good

00:44:22.519 --> 00:44:25.951
Christian source but he takes
out the stuff he found in Jude

00:44:25.951 --> 00:44:29.498
that he doesn't consider good
Christian material and Christian

00:44:29.498 --> 00:44:30.429
scripture.
 

00:44:30.429 --> 00:44:33.289
He edits out of Jude stuff,
that by that time,

00:44:33.289 --> 00:44:36.849
he believes is not really part
of Christian scripture.

00:44:36.849 --> 00:44:40.599
Again, what this shows us is
that the author of 2 Peter is

00:44:40.599 --> 00:44:44.085
living in a time when we
actually see the beginning of

00:44:44.085 --> 00:44:46.518
Christian scripture coming
about.

00:44:46.518 --> 00:44:49.190
This is a very different time
from the apostolic period when

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:51.650
they were just writing letters,
occasional letters for

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:54.543
different purposes--
not having any idea that they

00:44:54.543 --> 00:44:57.460
were creating a New Testament
themselves.

00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:01.231
This author is not living in
the time by which we have a New

00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:02.000
Testament.
 

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.969
That'll take another few
centuries to come about,

00:45:03.969 --> 00:45:06.226
as I talked about the first
lecture, when I talked about

00:45:06.226 --> 00:45:07.130
Canon development.
 

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:08.659
That's going to happen.
 

00:45:08.659 --> 00:45:11.672
But he's certainly living in a
time that's between the

00:45:11.672 --> 00:45:14.210
apostolic period,
when everything is much more

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:15.650
chaotic,
and there's not any Christian

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:18.603
scripture,
and now you do have Christian

00:45:18.603 --> 00:45:22.849
scripture on its way to becoming
its own Canon.

00:45:22.849 --> 00:45:25.750
This is in a post-apostolic
period.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:28.077
So the last thing is:
what does the apocalyptic do

00:45:28.077 --> 00:45:28.409
here?
 

00:45:28.409 --> 00:45:34.418
Look at 2 Peter 3:3,
because there is apocalyptic

00:45:34.418 --> 00:45:35.920
here also.
 

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.949
First you must understand this,
that in the last days scoffers

00:45:38.949 --> 00:45:42.030
will come scoffing and indulging
their own lust and saying,

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:43.518
where is the promise of his
coming?

00:45:43.518 --> 00:45:46.128
For ever since our ancestors
died all things continue as they

00:45:46.128 --> 00:45:47.780
were from the beginning of
creation.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:49.530
Notice that's got to be
post-Peter,

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:52.224
Peter in his own time would
never have talked about the

00:45:52.224 --> 00:45:54.820
beginning of the Jesus movement
as happening way,

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:57.199
way--with our ancestors."
 

00:45:57.199 --> 00:46:00.268
They deliberately ignore this
fact that by the Word of God,

00:46:00.268 --> 00:46:02.525
the heavens existed long ago,
and an earth was formed out of

00:46:02.525 --> 00:46:05.152
water and by means of water,
through which the world of that

00:46:05.152 --> 00:46:07.110
time was deluged with water and
perished.

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:09.224
By the same word,
the present heavens and earth

00:46:09.224 --> 00:46:11.936
have been reserved for fire,
have been kept until the Day of

00:46:11.936 --> 00:46:13.960
Judgment and destruction of the
godless.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:16.702
He believes this end is coming,
this end of fire,

00:46:16.702 --> 00:46:18.929
the destruction of the current
world.

00:46:18.929 --> 00:46:21.103
But do not ignore this one
fact, beloved,

00:46:21.103 --> 00:46:23.876
that with the Lord one day is
like a thousand years,

00:46:23.876 --> 00:46:26.159
and a thousand years are like
one day.

00:46:26.159 --> 00:46:28.594
The Lord is not slow about his
promises as some think of

00:46:28.594 --> 00:46:31.293
slowness, but he is patient with
you not wanting any to perish

00:46:31.293 --> 00:46:32.800
but all to come to repentance.
 

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.909
But the day of the Lord will
come like a thief,

00:46:34.909 --> 00:46:37.518
and then the heavens will pass
away with a loud noise,

00:46:37.518 --> 00:46:39.340
the elements will be dissolved
with fire,

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:41.688
and the earth and everything
that is done on it will be

00:46:41.688 --> 00:46:42.210
disclosed.
 

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:46.280
He does have an apocalyptic
scenario.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.050
What does it do for him?
 

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:50.673
Nothing, it's just something
that's part of Christian

00:46:50.673 --> 00:46:52.289
doctrine that he's passing on.
 

00:46:52.289 --> 00:46:55.239
There's no franticness here,
there's no idea that it's going

00:46:55.239 --> 00:46:56.340
to happen right now.
 

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:58.989
In fact he says it could happen
in a thousand years.

00:46:58.989 --> 00:47:04.702
We're no longer with this
letter in a kind of Christianity

00:47:04.702 --> 00:47:08.309
that has apocalyptic fervor to
it.

00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:11.460
We're in a kind of Christianity
that is starting to have its own

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.023
Christian scripture,
that's fairly conservative

00:47:14.023 --> 00:47:16.713
again politically,
that you don't see a lot of

00:47:16.713 --> 00:47:19.369
stuff against Rome,
and that sort of thing,

00:47:19.369 --> 00:47:22.496
and the function of the
apocalyticism here is simply

00:47:22.496 --> 00:47:25.989
it's just something you believe
if you're a Christian.

00:47:25.989 --> 00:47:28.340
Again, it's another example.
 

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:33.266
Apocalyptic is a political
ideology, but what kind of

00:47:33.266 --> 00:47:39.518
politics it teaches in the early
times of Christianity can vary.

00:47:39.518 --> 00:47:42.635
Apocalyptic can be something
that strengthens you against

00:47:42.635 --> 00:47:46.391
Roman oppression,
that labels Rome for you as a

00:47:46.391 --> 00:47:47.907
whore,
and Jezebel,

00:47:47.907 --> 00:47:50.867
and a monster,
or it can teach you to be quiet

00:47:50.867 --> 00:47:52.840
and go about your business.
 

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:56.829
One of the things that you're
going to be talking about in

00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:59.952
your sections is,
which kinds of text in early

00:47:59.952 --> 00:48:03.027
Christianity that we've looked
at function what way

00:48:03.027 --> 00:48:03.949
politically?
 

00:48:03.949 --> 00:48:06.849
Apocalyptic is one of those
political kinds of forces in

00:48:06.849 --> 00:48:09.487
early Christianity,
although certainly not the only

00:48:09.487 --> 00:48:09.909
one.
 

00:48:09.909 --> 00:48:12.574
You're supposed to look at
these texts and say,

00:48:12.574 --> 00:48:15.010
what politics is assumed by
these texts?

00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:17.659
See you next week.

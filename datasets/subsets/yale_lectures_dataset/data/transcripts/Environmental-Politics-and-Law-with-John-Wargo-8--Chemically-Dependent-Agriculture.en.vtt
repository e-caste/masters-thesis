00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.022
Prof: This is one of my
favorite topics in the course,

00:00:05.022 --> 00:00:06.160
food, agriculture.
 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.931
And I'm deeply interested in
everybody's personal connection

00:00:10.931 --> 00:00:11.740
to food.
 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.532
You are what you eat,
you are what you breathe,

00:00:14.532 --> 00:00:16.050
you are what you drink.
 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.767
And we often don't have a very
good understanding of what's in

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:23.120
our food, what's in our air,
and what's in our water.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.161
So hopefully,
this will sensitize you to that

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:32.121
problem and also to get you to
understand hopefully the

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:34.050
structure of U.S.
 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.450
environmental law that applies
to food and agriculture.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.250
And this is an interesting area
of law.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.189
Food, like plastics,
like energy,

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:47.425
it really does not have a
distinctive specific body of law

00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:54.380
that applies to it,
as opposed to air and water or

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.280
pesticides.
 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.070
So that's kind of curious.
 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.475
It's a problem that cuts across
many different areas,

00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:03.899
many different types of
regulation.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.415
And the management of food in
the U.S., and the management of

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:11.049
agriculture, is really fractured
among a number of agencies.

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.875
Great Britain recently
centralized their regulatory

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:20.989
program and created a single
agency to manage food.

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:23.616
And we'll think about the
wisdom of doing that,

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:26.985
and some of the strengths and
weaknesses of the European and

00:01:26.985 --> 00:01:28.069
British system.
 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:31.257
So to begin,
I want you to think about the

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:36.001
percentage of the world that is
used to grow crops or to graze

00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:37.090
livestock.
 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.840
So there are thirty billion
acres of land in the world,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.730
and about four billion acres of
those are in cropland.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.672
So roughly about one-seventh or
one-eighth of the world is used

00:01:48.672 --> 00:01:49.690
to grow crops.
 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.592
Within the United States,
it's about 400 million acres of

00:01:53.592 --> 00:01:54.080
land.
 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.459
It's an enormous area.
 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:00.405
And it's dispersed increasingly
in more remote areas as cities

00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:04.378
grow, as suburbs sprawl,
and as farmers are pushed

00:02:04.378 --> 00:02:06.730
further and further away.
 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.972
And this has really interesting
and important implications for

00:02:10.972 --> 00:02:14.449
environmental quality and also
for human health.

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.020
So here are four crops
represented in these pictures.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.330
Wheat in the upper left, corn.
 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.438
Many of you are probably
unaware that on a daily basis

00:02:24.438 --> 00:02:28.626
most of us consume cotton in a
variety of foods without

00:02:28.626 --> 00:02:30.099
recognizing it.
 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.270
Anybody know in what form?
 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.060
Oil, cottonseed oil.
 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.324
It's part of many pastries,
many different kinds of

00:02:40.324 --> 00:02:44.930
cereals, so that many breads
rely on cottonseed oil.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.310
And the bottom, rice.
 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.533
These are four major grains in
the world that take up hundreds

00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:55.960
of millions of acres of the
landscape.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.667
Corn alone in the United States
is almost eighty million acres

00:02:58.667 --> 00:02:59.910
that is currently planted.
 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.188
Increasingly,
in the United States,

00:03:02.188 --> 00:03:05.675
farm size is increasing,
meaning that there are fewer

00:03:05.675 --> 00:03:07.150
and fewer farmers.
 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.147
And surprisingly,
the diversity of crops that are

00:03:10.147 --> 00:03:13.210
planted on individual farms is
also going down.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.793
So what that means is that
farming is becoming more highly

00:03:17.793 --> 00:03:22.938
specialized, that farmers are
knowledgeable about fewer crops.

00:03:22.938 --> 00:03:29.050
They have less capacity to
manage problems such as pests,

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.324
fungi, insects of different
sorts, because they really don't

00:03:33.324 --> 00:03:36.875
have the fundamental
understanding of ecology that

00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:41.149
many farmers had to have in
order to survive in a world that

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:44.699
was not as chemically dependent
as ours is.

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:48.565
Current industrialized
agriculture could be successful

00:03:48.565 --> 00:03:52.721
on a parking lot if you brought
in soil and you brought in

00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:56.877
fertilizer and you brought in
water and artificially added

00:03:56.877 --> 00:03:58.410
organic matter.
 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.759
So basically,
the more you control your

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.419
environment using industrial
technology,

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.453
the more expensive it becomes,
but the less you have to worry

00:04:07.453 --> 00:04:09.468
about understanding ecology.
 

00:04:09.468 --> 00:04:13.963
So it's curious that as
centralization has occurred in

00:04:13.963 --> 00:04:17.208
ownership patterns,
the farms got larger,

00:04:17.208 --> 00:04:20.776
the crop specialty diminished,
our dietary patterns have

00:04:20.776 --> 00:04:22.420
followed a similar pattern.
 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.449
We've relied on fewer and fewer
crops.

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.288
So now most people's diet is
comprised of between thirty to

00:04:30.288 --> 00:04:33.209
forty different individual
crops.

00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:36.487
So I want to talk today about
what the central problems in

00:04:36.487 --> 00:04:38.040
food and agriculture are.
 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.829
And these include food
availability.

00:04:40.829 --> 00:04:43.908
And I think most of us
understand that the role of

00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:47.300
government has often been
perceived as one of trying to

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.629
make sure that we have a
productive food supply,

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:54.000
that our agriculture is as
productive as it possibly could

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.430
be so we could maximize our
exports to other countries,

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.550
so that our balance of trade
would be helped,

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.454
but also so we could deal with
undernourished and impoverished

00:05:02.454 --> 00:05:05.550
parts of the world that do not
have the capacity to grow food,

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.670
for whatever reason.
 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.824
Food prices are going up,
particularly in the last

00:05:09.824 --> 00:05:12.238
decade,
they've taken up an increasing

00:05:12.238 --> 00:05:14.889
percentage of the average
household income,

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.850
meaning that people are looking
to buy lower cost foods.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.319
And lower cost foods are often
higher calorie foods.

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.889
They're often foods that come
in bulk packages.

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:30.014
So people are more prone to buy
the liter and a half bottles of

00:05:30.014 --> 00:05:33.240
soda than they would individual
cans.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.720
And that has had an influence
on patterns of food consumption.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.093
As I mentioned,
species dependence has gone

00:05:39.093 --> 00:05:39.490
down.
 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.120
We're relying on fewer and
fewer crops.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.790
We're genetically engineering
those crops more and more.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.355
A very high proportion of corn
that's planted in the United

00:05:48.355 --> 00:05:50.079
States is now genetically
engineered.

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:53.389
The same goes for the other
major grains that we produce.

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.408
Also a serious problem that we
have is that our tastes are

00:05:57.408 --> 00:06:00.439
being cultivated by other
organizations,

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:03.947
particularly food processors,
that are adding ingredients

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:07.829
that we don't really pay much
attention to in terms of fat,

00:06:07.829 --> 00:06:11.129
in terms of salt,
in terms of sugar,

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:16.012
and a variety of artificial
flavors and colors that they do

00:06:16.012 --> 00:06:21.569
very careful social surveys to
understand what kinds of tastes,

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:24.783
what kinds of colors,
what kinds of flavors people

00:06:24.783 --> 00:06:25.899
enjoy the most.
 

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:30.324
I use the example of Salmofan,
so that salmon is now colored

00:06:30.324 --> 00:06:34.000
in thirty-five to thirty-six
different shades,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.319
ranging from a really deep red
to a very light coral.

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:42.122
So they did their focus groups
and conducted surveys,

00:06:42.122 --> 00:06:46.509
and figured out that most
people like number thirty-three.

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:51.490
So that type of thinking is
pervading the food industry.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.560
We as buyers tend to respond.
 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:01.019
We respond by basically looking
for the lower cost foods,

00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:07.365
but also those that seem to
provide either taste or some

00:07:07.365 --> 00:07:10.480
other aesthetic appeal.
 

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.769
We also are consuming more
calories than we ever have

00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:14.338
before.
 

00:07:14.338 --> 00:07:17.865
We are consuming on average in
the United States about 3,900

00:07:17.865 --> 00:07:19.180
calories per person.
 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.696
Only fifteen years ago,
we were consuming about 3,200

00:07:22.696 --> 00:07:23.439
calories.
 

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:30.079
And that's up from perhaps
2,700,2,800 calories per person.

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:33.387
And the average person with the
average weight,

00:07:33.387 --> 00:07:37.127
say a 165-pound male,
could survive extremely well on

00:07:37.127 --> 00:07:40.220
a diet of about 2,400 calories
per day.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.310
Now this would vary
tremendously.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.060
I know some of you are athletes.
 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.793
Some of you may run ten miles a
day, some of you may swim four

00:07:47.793 --> 00:07:49.139
or five miles a day.
 

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:54.699
For those of you that exercise
a great deal will obviously need

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:57.480
a much higher caloric intake.
 

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.017
But if you combine knowledge
about what's happened to our

00:08:01.017 --> 00:08:04.430
behavior and our increasingly
sedentary lifestyles,

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.949
sitting behind computers,
watching video games.

00:08:07.949 --> 00:08:11.281
The latest report came out only
last week demonstrating that

00:08:11.281 --> 00:08:14.048
kids are now spending seven
hours a day looking at

00:08:14.048 --> 00:08:16.759
electronic equipment in one form
or another.

00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:19.180
This is really quite striking.
 

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.259
In my generation,
we had televisions.

00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:25.610
But television wasn't that big
a thing when I grew up.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.439
And we spent a whole lot more
time outdoors.

00:08:28.439 --> 00:08:32.652
People are spending time
indoors, they're not burning up

00:08:32.652 --> 00:08:37.629
as much energy as they used to,
so we're all putting on weight.

00:08:37.629 --> 00:08:39.038
Water consumption.
 

00:08:39.038 --> 00:08:41.421
Water consumption,
especially in arid parts of the

00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:43.615
word,
irrigation necessary for

00:08:43.615 --> 00:08:46.115
agriculture,
this is a critical problem,

00:08:46.115 --> 00:08:48.308
particularly related to climate
change,

00:08:48.308 --> 00:08:53.210
which is causing experts to
predict that it's going to be

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:58.808
increasingly expensive to move
water into dryer environments,

00:08:58.808 --> 00:09:03.791
meaning that it's going to be a
requirement to ship those foods

00:09:03.791 --> 00:09:07.870
from longer distances,
demanding higher energy.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:12.206
Most of us don't really have
much knowledge of the energy it

00:09:12.206 --> 00:09:16.469
takes to produce say a bowl of
peas as opposed to a bowl of

00:09:16.469 --> 00:09:18.159
oatmeal or a steak.
 

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:20.278
And that's quite curious.
 

00:09:20.278 --> 00:09:24.640
The amount of energy obviously
increases with distance from the

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.298
source of production to the
source of consumption.

00:09:28.298 --> 00:09:30.782
But we really don't pay any
attention to that,

00:09:30.782 --> 00:09:33.210
and we don't have any way of
measuring it.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.186
This by the way would be a
terrific term paper,

00:09:35.186 --> 00:09:37.677
if somebody's still thinking
about a research topic for the

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:38.149
course.
 

00:09:38.149 --> 00:09:39.658
Just take one food.
 

00:09:39.658 --> 00:09:42.005
Just take apples,
figure out where apples are

00:09:42.005 --> 00:09:45.962
produced in the world,
figure out where Yale buys its

00:09:45.962 --> 00:09:48.355
apples,
and try to come up with a

00:09:48.355 --> 00:09:52.337
metric for the energy involved
in moving an apple from point of

00:09:52.337 --> 00:09:54.779
production to point of
consumption.

00:09:54.779 --> 00:09:58.460
So you could imagine a society
decades into the future where

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:02.202
you could take your iPhone and
you could walk up to a grocery

00:10:02.202 --> 00:10:05.945
store shelf and you could hold
the bar code on the food or on

00:10:05.945 --> 00:10:08.940
the side of the shelf next to
your phone,

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.940
and you could call up
information on where the food

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:11.418
came from.
 

00:10:11.418 --> 00:10:13.850
You could call up information
on its energy.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.879
Was it produced using
artificial chemicals?

00:10:16.879 --> 00:10:21.038
Or what kinds of fertilizers
were used to produce it?

00:10:21.038 --> 00:10:25.278
So we could get a whole new
level of understanding of energy

00:10:25.278 --> 00:10:29.158
and the environmental health of
different products,

00:10:29.158 --> 00:10:32.250
including issues such as
protein content,

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.330
fat content,
type of fat,

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.220
amount of salt,
et cetera.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.047
Right now, most of us walk
through the marketplace really

00:10:40.047 --> 00:10:43.158
blind to these issues,
blind to the environmental

00:10:43.158 --> 00:10:47.827
effects of food production,
blind also to the energy

00:10:47.827 --> 00:10:49.240
consumption.
 

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.772
We also have very little
understanding of food

00:10:51.772 --> 00:10:53.812
processing,
and I want you to think about a

00:10:53.812 --> 00:10:56.320
couple of commodities that you
experience on a routine basis.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.629
You take cotton,
for example,

00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:59.408
that I just showed you a
picture of.

00:10:59.408 --> 00:11:05.870
Cotton seeds are put into a
machine.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:09.182
They are ground up,
then they are sprayed by a

00:11:09.182 --> 00:11:09.918
solvent.
 

00:11:09.918 --> 00:11:13.802
The solvent extracts the oils,
and the oil drips down into

00:11:13.802 --> 00:11:14.278
vats.
 

00:11:14.278 --> 00:11:19.697
It gets mixed with other kinds
of vegetable oils and winds its

00:11:19.697 --> 00:11:21.830
way into supermarkets.
 

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.788
How about grapes?
 

00:11:23.788 --> 00:11:26.470
Well grapes have water
extracted from them.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.759
And they are turned into
raisins.

00:11:28.759 --> 00:11:31.639
You can think of a variety of
different foods.

00:11:31.639 --> 00:11:33.330
Corn as another example.
 

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.649
Oil is extracted from corn.
 

00:11:35.649 --> 00:11:36.909
How is it done?
 

00:11:36.909 --> 00:11:37.889
It's done using a solvent.
 

00:11:37.889 --> 00:11:39.370
Well, what happens to the
solvent?

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:40.279
Where does it go?
 

00:11:40.279 --> 00:11:42.019
Are there residues of the
solvent in corn oil?

00:11:42.019 --> 00:11:45.187
And the answer is often yes,
the residues do persist,

00:11:45.187 --> 00:11:47.320
they do get into the food
supply.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.606
But we have very little
understanding of what happens to

00:11:51.606 --> 00:11:56.440
food when it leaves the farm on
its way to our dinner table.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.110
Food packaging is a topic that
we'll take on in a few weeks,

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.600
particularly with respect to
plastics.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.753
In the absence of our
understanding the origin of the

00:12:05.753 --> 00:12:07.759
plastic,
the content of the plastic,

00:12:07.759 --> 00:12:10.240
the energy that it takes to
produce the plastic,

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.918
is really quite striking.
 

00:12:11.918 --> 00:12:15.822
All of the plastic waste that
surrounds most of the meats that

00:12:15.822 --> 00:12:19.788
are produced and available in
grocery stores is thrown away.

00:12:19.788 --> 00:12:22.184
And there's almost no hope that
any of that plastic is ever

00:12:22.184 --> 00:12:22.639
recycled.
 

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:24.879
It's simply discarded and it's
burned.

00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:27.484
And many of the plastics
contain chemicals that you

00:12:27.484 --> 00:12:29.100
really don't want to breathe.
 

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.769
Or if they're buried in
landfills, they will leach.

00:12:31.769 --> 00:12:34.827
They will break down gradually
and they will leach into soils

00:12:34.827 --> 00:12:36.460
and underlying water supplies.
 

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.759
And as I mentioned in an
earlier lecture,

00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:42.538
in every landfill,
among the 300,000 that exist in

00:12:42.538 --> 00:12:45.312
the nation,
you can find these residues of

00:12:45.312 --> 00:12:48.639
plastic in the soil and the
underlying groundwater supply.

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:52.327
So the key environmental and
health problems associated with

00:12:52.327 --> 00:12:55.580
our methods of food production
include pesticides.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.513
And I'll talk a bit about
pesticides today and the

00:12:58.513 --> 00:13:00.250
structure of pesticide law.
 

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:04.957
There are now some 25,000
pesticides that are packaged in

00:13:04.957 --> 00:13:09.581
different ways and sold in
different combinations in the

00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:11.600
United States alone.
 

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.681
In the world marketplace,
there are 75,000 different

00:13:14.681 --> 00:13:18.063
pesticide products that have
been registered by different

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:18.789
nations.
 

00:13:18.789 --> 00:13:20.418
How about fertilizers?
 

00:13:20.418 --> 00:13:22.836
Well, in some parts of the
world, human waste is used as

00:13:22.836 --> 00:13:24.418
fertilizers, animal waste is
used.

00:13:24.418 --> 00:13:29.432
But also, there are fossil-fuel
based fertilizers that are very

00:13:29.432 --> 00:13:30.158
common.
 

00:13:30.158 --> 00:13:34.192
So increasingly,
we find fertilizer being used

00:13:34.192 --> 00:13:39.121
as farmers continually plant and
replant the same field,

00:13:39.121 --> 00:13:42.080
they don't let it lie fallow.
 

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.937
They don't plant crops that can
fix nitrogen into the soil,

00:13:46.937 --> 00:13:50.120
so they have to add it
artificially.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.921
Coloring agents,
most of you probably do not pay

00:13:52.921 --> 00:13:56.080
too much attention to coloring
agents in your food.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.620
But there's a very interesting
history of coloring agents.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.879
And different nations have
different laws.

00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:05.908
And some of these agents are
natural, others are artificial.

00:14:05.908 --> 00:14:09.308
But that would be another great
paper topic.

00:14:09.308 --> 00:14:13.932
Just take a look carefully at
what we know about different

00:14:13.932 --> 00:14:17.990
kinds of chemicals that are used
to color foods.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:21.884
Flavors also,
artificial flavors and natural

00:14:21.884 --> 00:14:22.789
flavors.
 

00:14:22.789 --> 00:14:24.418
What do you know about them?
 

00:14:24.418 --> 00:14:27.519
They do not have to be labeled
under federal food law.

00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:31.672
So natural flavors is an
umbrella category,

00:14:31.672 --> 00:14:34.539
artificial flavors also is.
 

00:14:34.539 --> 00:14:37.990
And this is a huge industry.
 

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.270
If you decided you wanted to
produce say a new concoction,

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.149
maybe it would be a
coconut-flavored applesauce.

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:48.878
Well, you could basically get
some sort of pureed fruit of

00:14:48.878 --> 00:14:52.196
different sorts,
maybe pear, maybe apple,

00:14:52.196 --> 00:14:53.690
maybe peaches.
 

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.490
You could grind the pulp up,
and by processing it,

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:58.720
you would likely lose all the
flavor.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.830
So you'd have to figure out how
to put the flavor back into it.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.918
Well, you could do that really
easily.

00:15:02.918 --> 00:15:06.610
I encourage you to go online
and take a look at the

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:10.230
International Flavors and
Fragrances Institute.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.200
And it will give you a list of
firms,

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.408
chemical companies all over the
world that will allow you to

00:15:14.408 --> 00:15:17.125
say,
"Yes, I want to make a

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:22.037
coconut-lime applesauce or a
root beer flavored chewing

00:15:22.037 --> 00:15:23.220
gum."
 

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.110
They will give you the chemical
company's name and they will

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:31.330
provide you with the essences
necessary to create the product.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.313
Also, you may not know,
but fragrances are commonly

00:15:34.313 --> 00:15:37.368
used in food,
because fragrances will trigger

00:15:37.368 --> 00:15:41.565
the same nerve response in your
mouth and in your mind that the

00:15:41.565 --> 00:15:43.190
flavors will trigger.
 

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:46.211
So to create a sense that
you're eating say,

00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:50.287
root beer flavored oatmeal,
they could simply use a drop of

00:15:50.287 --> 00:15:53.379
a fragrance to give you that
impression.

00:15:53.379 --> 00:15:57.000
So packaging materials,
processing effects,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.460
contamination of air,
water, and food,

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.830
and genetic modification,
these are all critical,

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.730
highly debated topics around
the world,

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:07.750
given the fact that many
nations have different

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:08.538
standards.
 

00:16:08.538 --> 00:16:11.158
Whereas the marketplace,
the global marketplace,

00:16:11.158 --> 00:16:15.349
clearly is moving commodities
at a lightening pace across

00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:20.133
national boundaries,
creating serious legal problems

00:16:20.133 --> 00:16:25.467
for firms that have to
understand the difficult problem

00:16:25.467 --> 00:16:31.200
of having different regulations
in different countries.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:35.138
And there are deeper problems
here associated with the food

00:16:35.138 --> 00:16:35.750
supply.
 

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:39.172
And they include really a
fractured legal and regulatory

00:16:39.172 --> 00:16:40.230
responsibility.
 

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:43.408
And I'll talk more about that
in a few moments.

00:16:43.408 --> 00:16:47.014
Private science,
the fact that the majority of

00:16:47.014 --> 00:16:51.258
science that underlies
understanding the environmental

00:16:51.258 --> 00:16:53.360
effects,
the health effects,

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.657
the energy consumption required
in order to produce and move

00:16:56.657 --> 00:16:59.485
food,
the energy required to deal

00:16:59.485 --> 00:17:02.089
with the waste,
that the science is being

00:17:02.089 --> 00:17:05.182
conducted in the private sector,
it's often not available to the

00:17:05.182 --> 00:17:05.930
public sector.
 

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:09.807
So trade secrecy law is quite
important in this case in that

00:17:09.807 --> 00:17:13.355
it often prevents you from
understanding in detail what

00:17:13.355 --> 00:17:17.233
you'd really need to know in
order to take control over your

00:17:17.233 --> 00:17:18.220
own diet.
 

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:22.217
Worker safety is another deeper
problem that we don't pay much

00:17:22.217 --> 00:17:23.200
attention to.
 

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.861
If you look at the farm worker
poisoning data,

00:17:26.861 --> 00:17:30.930
it becomes apparent that
workers are often not well

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.069
protected.
 

00:17:32.069 --> 00:17:36.618
They're often not monitored.
 

00:17:36.618 --> 00:17:40.894
They often do not have
insurance and healthcare,

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:44.348
so that it's a neglected
population.

00:17:44.348 --> 00:17:48.342
Migrant workers traditionally
have been exploited in almost

00:17:48.342 --> 00:17:50.269
every nation in the world.
 

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:52.990
But even in our country,
where we think we have highly

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:55.795
sophisticated law,
workers really are not

00:17:55.795 --> 00:17:59.640
protected nearly the same as you
or I would be,

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.191
so that there are different
standards for allowable risk for

00:18:04.191 --> 00:18:07.200
workers than there are for you
or I,

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.450
say from purchasing food in the
marketplace,

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.470
different contamination limits.
 

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:16.836
Another deeper problem is the
narrative advantage of the

00:18:16.836 --> 00:18:17.788
producers.
 

00:18:17.788 --> 00:18:20.895
If you look at the scale of the
advertising industry and their

00:18:20.895 --> 00:18:23.528
methods of advertising--
and this also would be a great

00:18:23.528 --> 00:18:25.957
topic for a paper--
what are their dominant

00:18:25.957 --> 00:18:26.769
strategies?
 

00:18:26.769 --> 00:18:31.690
How do they make claims of
product benefit?

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.843
Either that it is natural,
that it is healthful,

00:18:34.843 --> 00:18:36.318
how far can they go?
 

00:18:36.318 --> 00:18:38.460
And what laws restrict what
they can claim?

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:43.044
What about their requirements
to disclose risks that are known

00:18:43.044 --> 00:18:45.750
to be associated with their
foods?

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:51.160
So it's interesting that the
organic food industry evolved,

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.580
basically growing from a
strategy that proclaims that a

00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:00.740
certain class of chemicals is
not present in the food supply.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.917
So synthetic organic pesticides
are not allowed to be used in

00:19:05.917 --> 00:19:07.298
organic foods.
 

00:19:07.298 --> 00:19:10.266
Now, that doesn't mean that
those that are producing

00:19:10.266 --> 00:19:13.930
non-organic foods have to label
what synthetic organic chemicals

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:15.210
are in their food.
 

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.902
So you can think about
different legal strategies that

00:19:17.902 --> 00:19:20.645
might be employed in order to
provide the consumer with

00:19:20.645 --> 00:19:23.593
knowledge that would be really
necessary to understand what

00:19:23.593 --> 00:19:24.660
they're eating.
 

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:30.471
Public subsidies also are a
worthy topic for somebody

00:19:30.471 --> 00:19:36.619
interested in trying to
transform the international food

00:19:36.619 --> 00:19:37.848
system.
 

00:19:37.848 --> 00:19:41.509
So if you look at the subsidies
carefully,

00:19:41.509 --> 00:19:43.989
and you can do this now because
there is a group in Washington

00:19:43.989 --> 00:19:46.306
called the Environmental Working
Group that put together a

00:19:46.306 --> 00:19:47.160
terrific website.
 

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.715
So you can go to the website
and you can find your home state

00:19:51.715 --> 00:19:54.068
and your county or your town.
 

00:19:54.068 --> 00:19:56.596
And you can figure out which
farmers are getting which

00:19:56.596 --> 00:19:57.170
subsidies.
 

00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:00.554
And what you'll see is that
industrialized commodities,

00:20:00.554 --> 00:20:04.001
such as corn and wheat and
cotton, they're receiving the

00:20:04.001 --> 00:20:06.509
bulk of the subsidies in the
nation.

00:20:06.509 --> 00:20:10.961
As opposed to the organic
farmers or farmers that are

00:20:10.961 --> 00:20:14.301
beyond organic,
who basically receive no

00:20:14.301 --> 00:20:15.328
subsidy.
 

00:20:15.328 --> 00:20:19.121
So that government funds could
be used to innovate,

00:20:19.121 --> 00:20:23.214
to really transform the
structure of agriculture in the

00:20:23.214 --> 00:20:24.048
nation.
 

00:20:24.048 --> 00:20:28.220
But this is not likely in the
near future.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.770
Land values,
how do land values play into

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:34.279
the pattern of farming and
agriculture that we currently

00:20:34.279 --> 00:20:34.788
see?
 

00:20:34.788 --> 00:20:39.211
Well, what I suggested earlier
in the talk was that as urban

00:20:39.211 --> 00:20:43.858
areas and suburban areas sprawl
out into undeveloped lands,

00:20:43.858 --> 00:20:48.907
they commonly will cause
property values in lands that

00:20:48.907 --> 00:20:51.288
are nearby to increase.
 

00:20:51.288 --> 00:20:54.551
Their commercial value,
their residential value,

00:20:54.551 --> 00:20:58.787
or their industrial value may
shoot up quite quickly as a city

00:20:58.787 --> 00:20:59.618
expands.
 

00:20:59.618 --> 00:21:04.865
So that the value of the land
in terms of its productivity for

00:21:04.865 --> 00:21:09.250
different crops often can't
compete with this rising

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:13.318
property value,
so the farmer sells out.

00:21:13.318 --> 00:21:17.160
Also, the agricultural land,
it's flat generally.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.480
It also is not forested.
 

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.808
And what this means is that
it's really easy to develop.

00:21:24.808 --> 00:21:28.461
So you can imagine the problem
of developing in a forested

00:21:28.461 --> 00:21:31.920
area, it's much more expensive
for a land developer.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:37.515
So you find the rate of
transformation of farmland,

00:21:37.515 --> 00:21:41.880
especially in rural parts of
the U.S.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.681
that are in the target zone for
urban expansion,

00:21:45.681 --> 00:21:50.534
these lands are being shifted
into residential and commercial

00:21:50.534 --> 00:21:52.880
use at a very rapid rate.
 

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:58.167
So the fundamental problem that
I think we face right now is one

00:21:58.167 --> 00:21:59.680
of intelligence.
 

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.637
And I don't mean to imply that
it's an absence of capacity to

00:22:03.637 --> 00:22:07.002
understand these things,
it's an absence of producing

00:22:07.002 --> 00:22:09.887
the knowledge and making it
publically accessible to

00:22:09.887 --> 00:22:13.224
consumers in a way that really
could empower you to react in

00:22:13.224 --> 00:22:16.392
the marketplace in a way that
would send messages back to

00:22:16.392 --> 00:22:19.929
corporations,
messages that I think really

00:22:19.929 --> 00:22:24.878
are often much more powerful and
often more listened to than

00:22:24.878 --> 00:22:27.480
messages sent by regulators.
 

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:33.554
So I'd like you to think about
corn and ethanol for just a

00:22:33.554 --> 00:22:37.397
moment,
and the increasing subsidy for

00:22:37.397 --> 00:22:42.955
the production of ethanol that
it will oxygenate fuels and is

00:22:42.955 --> 00:22:47.308
required by different levels of
government,

00:22:47.308 --> 00:22:49.160
including the Environmental
Protection Agency,

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.480
as a way of improving air
quality.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.690
But what is increasingly
apparent is that the ethanol

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:01.224
subsidy has caused corn prices
to rise quite dramatically

00:23:01.224 --> 00:23:06.326
because more of the farmers are
putting these ethanol production

00:23:06.326 --> 00:23:10.941
plants on their property and
they're not shunting the corn

00:23:10.941 --> 00:23:13.288
into the food supply.
 

00:23:13.288 --> 00:23:17.556
Now, there also was an
overabundance of enthusiasm

00:23:17.556 --> 00:23:21.298
among the farmers to produce the
ethanol.

00:23:21.298 --> 00:23:26.915
So the ethanol market started
to collapse, and this has hurt

00:23:26.915 --> 00:23:31.009
the farmers throughout the
United States.

00:23:31.009 --> 00:23:35.737
Think now about one area,
and the area of chemical

00:23:35.737 --> 00:23:39.500
application, particularly
pesticides.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:43.798
This is an interesting area in
that it demands that you think

00:23:43.798 --> 00:23:46.019
about a real variety of laws.
 

00:23:46.019 --> 00:23:48.990
The Federal Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act,

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.940
on the top here,
the Federal Insecticide,

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.784
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act,
and the Food Quality Protection

00:23:54.784 --> 00:23:55.058
Act.
 

00:23:55.058 --> 00:23:58.895
These are the dominant statutes
in the United States that apply

00:23:58.895 --> 00:24:00.318
to pesticide control.
 

00:24:00.318 --> 00:24:04.785
But other laws as well are
necessary to understand,

00:24:04.785 --> 00:24:09.786
and have some control over
pesticides, including the Safe

00:24:09.786 --> 00:24:11.838
Drinking Water Act.
 

00:24:11.838 --> 00:24:14.648
In other words,
one would need to worry about

00:24:14.648 --> 00:24:18.288
the application of billions of
pounds of pesticides in the

00:24:18.288 --> 00:24:22.247
United States every year because
pesticides often don't just go

00:24:22.247 --> 00:24:22.950
away.
 

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.756
They often will move down
through soils and into

00:24:25.756 --> 00:24:27.130
groundwater supplies.
 

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:31.928
So we'll talk a bit later in
the week about the problem

00:24:31.928 --> 00:24:34.950
managing drinking water quality.
 

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:38.376
By the way, the government,
in its food intake surveys,

00:24:38.376 --> 00:24:42.185
concludes that the number one
food that everybody eats in the

00:24:42.185 --> 00:24:43.900
United States is water.
 

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.460
Water is classified as a food
under the Food,

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.789
Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
so that worrying about water

00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:53.730
contamination is a really
important issue,

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:57.500
and understanding the way that
chemical release into the

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.886
atmosphere,
as well as onto plants and into

00:25:00.886 --> 00:25:04.994
the landscape,
that could contaminate drinking

00:25:04.994 --> 00:25:05.640
water.
 

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.426
Even if it goes through a
filtration plant,

00:25:08.426 --> 00:25:11.480
that often is the case for many
urban areas.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.607
Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act that we talked a

00:25:14.607 --> 00:25:16.577
bit about last week,
and Superfund,

00:25:16.577 --> 00:25:19.588
most of these sites have
pesticides within them.

00:25:19.588 --> 00:25:23.300
And they are classified as
hazardous sites in part because

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.578
of the pesticides that are
there.

00:25:25.578 --> 00:25:30.153
Pesticides were in the RCRA
sites and the CERCLA sites on

00:25:30.153 --> 00:25:30.970
Vieques.
 

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:35.002
Predominately chemicals that
are persistent were applied back

00:25:35.002 --> 00:25:37.019
in the '30s, '40s,
and '50s.

00:25:37.019 --> 00:25:41.410
The Toxic Substance Control Act
does deal with pesticides.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:45.250
The Hazardous Material
Transportation Act does as well.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.884
The National Environmental
Policy Act that we talked about

00:25:47.884 --> 00:25:48.440
last week.
 

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.570
Endangered Species Act--if you
have an endangered species and

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:56.634
its habitat has been defined,
it's normally illegal to apply

00:25:56.634 --> 00:25:58.769
pesticides in that habitat.
 

00:25:58.769 --> 00:26:02.785
The Wilderness Act would
prevent pesticides from being

00:26:02.785 --> 00:26:05.210
applied within its boundaries.
 

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:09.221
And the manufacture of
pesticides often produces

00:26:09.221 --> 00:26:13.916
airborne residues that are
regulated under the Clean Air

00:26:13.916 --> 00:26:14.598
Act.
 

00:26:14.598 --> 00:26:19.528
And also the release via pipes
from those plants is regulated

00:26:19.528 --> 00:26:21.828
under the Clean Water Act.
 

00:26:21.828 --> 00:26:25.307
But as well,
you can imagine the problem of

00:26:25.307 --> 00:26:29.365
spraying chemicals year after
year on a landscape,

00:26:29.365 --> 00:26:33.920
and then you have rain storms
coming in the Spring.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.519
Give you a good example of that.
 

00:26:35.519 --> 00:26:37.885
Atrazine, which is an
herbicide, it's a pre-emergent

00:26:37.885 --> 00:26:39.726
herbicide,
so they plant the corn,

00:26:39.726 --> 00:26:42.694
but before the corn sprouts,
they'll spray the landscape

00:26:42.694 --> 00:26:45.788
with the atrazine,
often in the spring.

00:26:45.788 --> 00:26:49.063
Always in the spring,
actually, and particularly in

00:26:49.063 --> 00:26:49.980
the Midwest.
 

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.434
After the spring rains come,
you can measure spikes in

00:26:53.434 --> 00:26:57.281
atrazine in the Mississippi
River and most of the Midwestern

00:26:57.281 --> 00:26:58.000
rivers.
 

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.365
And these rivers in the Midwest
provide water supplies for tens

00:27:01.365 --> 00:27:02.670
of millions of people.
 

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.130
And the filtration of the
plants will not take it out.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:09.271
So both the Clean Water Act and
the Safe Drinking Water Act come

00:27:09.271 --> 00:27:10.519
into play in that case.
 

00:27:10.519 --> 00:27:14.711
And the Occupational Safety and
Health Act also is designed to

00:27:14.711 --> 00:27:16.358
protect worker safety.
 

00:27:16.358 --> 00:27:20.106
But as I said earlier,
it often sets standards that

00:27:20.106 --> 00:27:25.130
are far above standards that are
set for non-worker environments.

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:28.058
So it's a very complicated body
of law.

00:27:28.058 --> 00:27:31.377
But for this reason,
pesticides becomes a good

00:27:31.377 --> 00:27:33.368
window to understand law.
 

00:27:33.368 --> 00:27:38.439
One way to think about this is
that it's driven by two things

00:27:38.439 --> 00:27:39.200
really.
 

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:43.500
One is that pesticides are
intentionally toxic substances.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.361
They're not like say,
just some new chemical that

00:27:47.361 --> 00:27:52.348
somebody designs to be added to
plastic to make it stronger.

00:27:52.348 --> 00:27:56.443
That wasn't designed to kill a
different species,

00:27:56.443 --> 00:28:00.538
it was designed to provide some
functionality.

00:28:00.538 --> 00:28:03.712
But pesticides,
as a group of chemicals,

00:28:03.712 --> 00:28:07.863
were specifically designed to
injure either a plant,

00:28:07.863 --> 00:28:10.630
an insect, some other species.
 

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:14.692
In fact, some of the nerve
gases that were designed during

00:28:14.692 --> 00:28:19.470
World War II and in the 1920s by
Great Britain and Nazi Germany,

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:23.328
they were designed specifically
to harm humans.

00:28:23.328 --> 00:28:27.144
And many of these nerve gases
have been diluted down for

00:28:27.144 --> 00:28:28.808
agricultural purposes.
 

00:28:28.808 --> 00:28:32.813
So that all species have been
targets for the development of

00:28:32.813 --> 00:28:34.509
this class of biocides.
 

00:28:34.509 --> 00:28:37.105
So number one,
they're intentionally toxic

00:28:37.105 --> 00:28:37.930
substances.
 

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:39.615
And number two,
to get their effect,

00:28:39.615 --> 00:28:42.166
they've got to be released to
the environment in great

00:28:42.166 --> 00:28:42.890
quantities.
 

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.715
So you release a chemical to
the environment,

00:28:45.715 --> 00:28:49.249
the atomic weapons testing
history tells us you'd better

00:28:49.249 --> 00:28:52.140
understand something about where
it goes.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:55.501
And pesticide history is
replete with examples where

00:28:55.501 --> 00:28:57.808
people paid too little
attention.

00:28:57.808 --> 00:29:03.278
Now I want to step back and
take you into the earlier part

00:29:03.278 --> 00:29:04.910
of the century.
 

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:09.131
And I want you to think about a
very serious problem at that

00:29:09.131 --> 00:29:13.710
point in time and a problem that
persists, and that's malaria.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:18.788
Malaria is an illness that's
transmitted by a parasite.

00:29:18.788 --> 00:29:24.922
The anopheles mosquito and all
of its variants had the capacity

00:29:24.922 --> 00:29:31.054
to take the parasite up from the
blood of an infected animal or

00:29:31.054 --> 00:29:33.230
an infected human.
 

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:38.348
So if you had malaria and an
insect came and landed on you,

00:29:38.348 --> 00:29:42.428
the anopheles mosquito would
first spit a little bit of an

00:29:42.428 --> 00:29:46.507
anticoagulant through its
proboscis into your body to help

00:29:46.507 --> 00:29:48.440
you bleed a little bit.
 

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:53.019
And then it would suck your
blood into its stomach cavity.

00:29:53.019 --> 00:29:55.942
And with that blood,
it would pull in malaria

00:29:55.942 --> 00:29:58.200
parasites that are in your body.
 

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.932
Then perhaps assume I didn't
have malaria,

00:30:00.932 --> 00:30:03.798
that mosquito flew over and
landed on me.

00:30:03.798 --> 00:30:08.392
It would bite me and when it
would insert its anticoagulant

00:30:08.392 --> 00:30:12.113
in its saliva in me,
it would transmit parasites

00:30:12.113 --> 00:30:13.460
into my body.
 

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.920
And that's the way that this
illness is transmitted from

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:16.769
person to person.
 

00:30:16.769 --> 00:30:21.549
The parasite has the capacity
to live for nine to eleven days

00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:24.098
inside the body of a mosquito.
 

00:30:24.098 --> 00:30:26.200
And this is kind of an
interesting issue,

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.051
that the encephalitis virus
lasts from ten to twenty-five

00:30:29.051 --> 00:30:31.615
days,
and thank god the AIDS virus

00:30:31.615 --> 00:30:33.769
lasts only one to two days.
 

00:30:33.769 --> 00:30:39.127
So the longevity of different
viruses or bacteria or parasites

00:30:39.127 --> 00:30:44.400
inside different insects affects
the rate of transmission.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.537
So I want you to also
understand the scale of this

00:30:47.537 --> 00:30:49.009
problem in the world.
 

00:30:49.009 --> 00:30:52.565
And today, there are about
between 300 and 500 million

00:30:52.565 --> 00:30:55.920
people that are clinically
disabled by malaria,

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.615
meaning that they're walking
around with this parasite in

00:30:58.615 --> 00:31:00.880
their bodies that is sapping
them of energy,

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.910
that is giving them periodic
fevers,

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:05.440
that makes them more
susceptible to other kinds of

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.058
illnesses.
 

00:31:06.058 --> 00:31:09.383
And forty percent of the
world's population live in areas

00:31:09.383 --> 00:31:12.198
that are at risk,
meaning that the mosquitoes in

00:31:12.198 --> 00:31:15.019
that area are capable of
transmitting the parasite.

00:31:15.019 --> 00:31:18.746
And you've got a large
population percentage that also

00:31:18.746 --> 00:31:21.769
is carrying the parasite in
their bodies.

00:31:21.769 --> 00:31:25.972
The core of the problem for
malaria in the world is really

00:31:25.972 --> 00:31:29.660
in tropical regions and
particularly in Africa,

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:33.000
where ninety percent of the
incidents and mortality exist.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.472
And the estimate right now by
the World Health Organization is

00:31:36.472 --> 00:31:39.777
that roughly one to one and a
half million people die every

00:31:39.777 --> 00:31:41.029
year from malaria.
 

00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:44.451
And the estimate over the
twentieth century is about 100

00:31:44.451 --> 00:31:47.250
million people have died from
this illness.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:50.534
It's quite striking that many
people have not understood the

00:31:50.534 --> 00:31:51.868
scale of this problem.
 

00:31:51.868 --> 00:31:57.223
So it's also clear if you read
much military history that

00:31:57.223 --> 00:32:01.910
malaria was a very serious
problem in all wars.

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:07.720
So that if you go back to the
time of Napoleon or if you look

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:12.076
at the history of World War I or
World War II,

00:32:12.076 --> 00:32:13.528
as the U.S.
 

00:32:13.528 --> 00:32:16.130
or other countries moved into
tropical parts of the world,

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:20.772
more casualties commonly
occurred, more lost days among

00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:26.190
GIs occurred due to malaria than
it did to the direct effects of

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:27.480
casualties.
 

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.971
There are also susceptible
populations, kids in endemic

00:32:30.971 --> 00:32:31.490
areas.
 

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:35.240
Although in epidemics,
all age groups are affected.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.869
Refugees and migrant
populations, and those living in

00:32:38.869 --> 00:32:42.990
tents, such as those that are
fighting in armed conflict.

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:46.357
It's all related to heightened
exposure, being out in an

00:32:46.357 --> 00:32:49.421
environment where you're
exposing yourself to being

00:32:49.421 --> 00:32:51.318
bitten by infected insects.
 

00:32:51.318 --> 00:32:55.606
So you could also imagine that
those that work in mines or

00:32:55.606 --> 00:33:00.118
those that work in forestry in
tropical parts of the world or

00:33:00.118 --> 00:33:03.808
agriculture workers,
they are also more at risk.

00:33:03.808 --> 00:33:07.784
People that spend time outdoors
in the tropics in endemic areas

00:33:07.784 --> 00:33:10.476
are more at risk,
as are those with reduced

00:33:10.476 --> 00:33:11.309
immunity.
 

00:33:11.309 --> 00:33:12.609
Who has reduced immunity?
 

00:33:12.609 --> 00:33:14.048
Well, pregnant women.
 

00:33:14.048 --> 00:33:17.565
Pregnant women are extremely
susceptible to very serious

00:33:17.565 --> 00:33:20.568
illness from pregnancy and also
miscarriages.

00:33:20.568 --> 00:33:24.190
Also the very young,
young children.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:27.338
Those that already have their
immune system compromised.

00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:31.470
Or in the poorest parts of the
world,

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:35.441
you often have the background
high incidence of acute

00:33:35.441 --> 00:33:39.718
respiratory infections or
diarrheal diseases that reduces

00:33:39.718 --> 00:33:43.540
strength and immunity,
and makes one more susceptible

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:44.538
to this illness.
 

00:33:44.538 --> 00:33:47.568
Well, one of the ways of
controlling malaria,

00:33:47.568 --> 00:33:51.567
including pesticides,
and here's an example of a

00:33:51.567 --> 00:33:55.140
worker in 1939 in an outbreak in
Natal,

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:59.548
Brazil, when a mosquito
actually hitchhiked from Africa

00:33:59.548 --> 00:34:03.336
on a mail boat,
an anopheles gambiae

00:34:03.336 --> 00:34:07.410
mosquito,
not indigenous to Brazil.

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:12.989
So they finally figured out
that it hitchhiked on this mail

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:16.550
freighter, or a number of them
did.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:19.869
And they were able to establish
a fairly large and robust

00:34:19.869 --> 00:34:20.639
population.
 

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:24.451
And it occurred during a rainy
season when they had exactly the

00:34:24.451 --> 00:34:26.909
right pool of water standing on
areas.

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:30.967
Some mosquitoes actually are
interesting, in that they prefer

00:34:30.967 --> 00:34:34.347
streams or rivers that are
moving really quickly as

00:34:34.347 --> 00:34:35.159
habitat.
 

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:37.050
Others like very still water.
 

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:38.739
Others like shallow water.
 

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:41.898
So there are hundreds and
hundreds of different species of

00:34:41.898 --> 00:34:44.889
mosquitoes capable of
transmitting these illnesses,

00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:49.800
such as malaria or dengue fever
or yellow fever.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.429
So understanding the ecology
here is really important.

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:57.097
One way of dealing with the
problem and not understanding

00:34:57.097 --> 00:35:00.898
the ecology is basically to
simply spray broad areas of the

00:35:00.898 --> 00:35:04.670
landscape with pesticides,
which is what they did in this

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:05.018
case.
 

00:35:05.018 --> 00:35:06.063
When U.S.
 

00:35:06.063 --> 00:35:13.139
troops invaded islands in the
Pacific in the war against Japan

00:35:13.139 --> 00:35:18.360
in the mid-1940s,
the incidence among U.S.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:22.119
GIs was often 3,000 per 1,000
per year, as it was reported.

00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:25.860
Meaning that everybody on the
island had on average malaria at

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.559
least three times,
so that the casualty rates here

00:35:28.559 --> 00:35:31.199
caused them to have to move
troops in and out of the island

00:35:31.199 --> 00:35:33.518
much more rapidly than they
normally would have.

00:35:33.518 --> 00:35:39.014
The development of the chlorine
industry is a very important

00:35:39.014 --> 00:35:42.762
part of the story,
because chlorine is a key

00:35:42.762 --> 00:35:46.632
component of many pesticides
that were developed in the

00:35:46.632 --> 00:35:49.400
1940s,
including DDT.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:54.809
Chlorinated hydrocarbons
include aldrin,

00:35:54.809 --> 00:35:57.650
dieldrin, heptachlor,
chlordane, chemicals curiously

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:00.990
that became the target of the
Environmental Protection Agency

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:03.329
as soon as it was formed in the
1970s.

00:36:03.329 --> 00:36:05.139
And why is that?
 

00:36:05.139 --> 00:36:07.963
Well, because all of the
properties that made

00:36:07.963 --> 00:36:10.340
strontium-90 a dangerous
compound,

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:14.907
it persisted,
it moved widely through the

00:36:14.907 --> 00:36:18.702
environment,
it would contaminate virtually

00:36:18.702 --> 00:36:21.791
every compartment,
and it would build up in food

00:36:21.791 --> 00:36:24.021
chains,
marine food chains as well as

00:36:24.021 --> 00:36:28.170
in ecosystems,
in terrestrial ecosystems.

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:31.641
It would get in people's bodies
and it would be transmitted via

00:36:31.641 --> 00:36:33.489
breast milk across generations.
 

00:36:33.489 --> 00:36:37.807
So the search was on during
this explosion in the chemical

00:36:37.807 --> 00:36:42.052
industry in the 1940s for a
variety of new chemicals that

00:36:42.052 --> 00:36:46.639
would replace the older metals,
like Paris Green.

00:36:46.639 --> 00:36:51.228
In the previous shot here,
this gentleman is mixing Paris

00:36:51.228 --> 00:36:53.360
Green, which is arsenic.
 

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.039
He's mixing it by hand and he's
basically just throwing it out

00:36:56.039 --> 00:36:56.829
across a stream.
 

00:36:56.829 --> 00:37:00.065
So that the heavy metals used
earlier in the century were

00:37:00.065 --> 00:37:02.550
replaced by the chlorinated
hydrocarbons.

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:07.302
And gradually they figured out
that DDT in particular was

00:37:07.302 --> 00:37:11.885
exceptionally effective at
controlling the insects that

00:37:11.885 --> 00:37:16.300
would transmit the parasite that
causes malaria.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:21.063
So this was first tried as
refugees moved through Europe

00:37:21.063 --> 00:37:22.969
during World War II.
 

00:37:22.969 --> 00:37:26.742
And here's an example of taking
basically a variant on a bicycle

00:37:26.742 --> 00:37:28.239
pump and taking a hose.
 

00:37:28.239 --> 00:37:31.974
And the drill that was followed
was there was one shot down the

00:37:31.974 --> 00:37:35.193
back of the neck,
there was one shot down the

00:37:35.193 --> 00:37:38.273
waistband,
and then up into the lower part

00:37:38.273 --> 00:37:40.221
of the shirt,
front and back,

00:37:40.221 --> 00:37:42.300
and then up both of the pant
legs.

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.329
So that tens of thousands of
people were lined up in Rome,

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:49.539
walking through these stations
as people that were sanitation

00:37:49.539 --> 00:37:54.030
workers then would basically man
these pumps and spray people.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:56.239
This attempt brought the typhus
epidemic,

00:37:56.239 --> 00:38:02.480
that is transmitted by fleas,
to a close extremely rapidly,

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:06.202
within a matter of a couple
weeks, when it was anticipated

00:38:06.202 --> 00:38:08.489
to go on for months if not
years.

00:38:08.489 --> 00:38:12.730
Another example of a child at
the time being sprayed.

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:15.565
So gradually,
they recognized that DDT would

00:38:15.565 --> 00:38:19.260
kill so many different species
that it was sprayed across

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.239
marshlands and landscapes.
 

00:38:21.239 --> 00:38:24.001
And they realized at the end of
World War II that they should

00:38:24.001 --> 00:38:25.980
also release it for agriculture
purposes.

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:31.014
So by 1950, DDT was being
marketed as an effective way to

00:38:31.014 --> 00:38:35.871
control pests that would
threaten just about every crop

00:38:35.871 --> 00:38:37.849
you could imagine.
 

00:38:37.849 --> 00:38:41.639
More than 300 different crops,
critical components of U.S.

00:38:41.639 --> 00:38:44.418
agriculture,
were recommended to be treated

00:38:44.418 --> 00:38:46.139
by this single chemical.
 

00:38:46.139 --> 00:38:49.076
So DDT is good for me,
there's a little jingle that

00:38:49.076 --> 00:38:51.659
went along with this that kids
would sing.

00:38:51.659 --> 00:38:55.639
There was no understanding of
its bioaccumulation capacity.

00:38:55.639 --> 00:38:58.871
Even though they understood
that they only had to spray it

00:38:58.871 --> 00:39:01.442
once in an area,
whereas other compounds they

00:39:01.442 --> 00:39:04.320
would have to kind of come back
and keep on spraying.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.230
So I'll tell that story in just
a moment.

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:12.039
But here's another example of
Jones Beach in New York,

00:39:12.039 --> 00:39:17.170
where the County Public Health
Department is driving down the

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:21.960
beach and the sign that is on
the side of this truck,

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.219
you can't read it I'm sure,
but it's telling,

00:39:24.219 --> 00:39:27.289
it says, "DDT,
powerful insecticide,

00:39:27.289 --> 00:39:28.730
harmless to humans."
 

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:32.230
Very little understanding of
what they were doing.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:34.721
Kids were running down,
people were eating their

00:39:34.721 --> 00:39:35.409
hamburgers.
 

00:39:35.409 --> 00:39:38.494
Trucks would come by,
kids would be sitting at picnic

00:39:38.494 --> 00:39:39.030
tables.
 

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:40.664
The picnic table,
all the food,

00:39:40.664 --> 00:39:42.900
and the kids included would be
sprayed.

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:46.391
Very little understanding of
kind of the basic ecology of

00:39:46.391 --> 00:39:47.389
this compound.
 

00:39:47.389 --> 00:39:50.846
So it persists in the soil,
it was later discovered,

00:39:50.846 --> 00:39:54.641
ten to thirty-five years,
and in the atmosphere for three

00:39:54.641 --> 00:39:55.320
years.
 

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.918
And just as an aside,
they decided that they were

00:39:57.918 --> 00:39:59.489
going to just test the air.
 

00:39:59.489 --> 00:40:00.286
Just by chance,
somebody said,

00:40:00.286 --> 00:40:01.661
"Well, you know,
this is a ridiculous thing to

00:40:01.661 --> 00:40:02.018
do."
 

00:40:02.018 --> 00:40:06.094
But thirty meters off the ocean
on a freighter halfway between

00:40:06.094 --> 00:40:09.490
San Francisco and Tokyo,
they took air measurements and

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:12.516
found that DDT was present in
the air in the middle of the

00:40:12.516 --> 00:40:15.699
Pacific Ocean and that there was
a latitudinal gradient,

00:40:15.699 --> 00:40:19.260
so that as you approached the
Equator,

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:22.445
you would have a higher
concentration of DDT than if you

00:40:22.445 --> 00:40:23.199
moved away.
 

00:40:23.199 --> 00:40:24.369
And why was that?
 

00:40:24.369 --> 00:40:26.675
Well, it's because of the
increase number of pests that

00:40:26.675 --> 00:40:29.409
you get closer to the Equator in
tropical parts of the world,

00:40:29.409 --> 00:40:32.360
led those nations to spray more
DDT,

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:35.420
both for sanitation and public
health purposes,

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.090
but also for crop protection
purposes.

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:40.889
It was also found in human
tissues.

00:40:40.889 --> 00:40:43.929
And it probably is still
detectable in your tissue.

00:40:43.929 --> 00:40:47.672
In fact, I was looking at the
Food and Drug Administration's

00:40:47.672 --> 00:40:50.909
records on pesticide residues in
the food supply.

00:40:50.909 --> 00:40:54.719
It's kind of striking in that
even today, DDT is one of the

00:40:54.719 --> 00:40:57.150
most detected chemicals in the
U.S.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:59.449
food supply,
particularly in milk products,

00:40:59.449 --> 00:41:00.929
at very, very low levels.
 

00:41:00.929 --> 00:41:04.574
But it's a good indicator of
the long-term persistence of

00:41:04.574 --> 00:41:06.918
this compound,
and why we need to pay

00:41:06.918 --> 00:41:08.349
attention to that.
 

00:41:08.349 --> 00:41:12.480
Also, like strontium,
it was detected in breast milk,

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.090
meaning that if you were breast
fed,

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:19.179
your mom probably had a higher
concentration than you do,

00:41:19.179 --> 00:41:24.733
but any body burden that you've
got is coming from probably just

00:41:24.733 --> 00:41:28.429
stores from your mom,
because this compound binds to

00:41:28.429 --> 00:41:30.148
body fat,
it's lipophilic,

00:41:30.148 --> 00:41:32.070
as opposed to hydrophilic.
 

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:38.099
And that's the way that you'd
be exposed.

00:41:38.099 --> 00:41:41.199
Your grandmother probably had
residues far higher than your

00:41:41.199 --> 00:41:41.679
mother.
 

00:41:41.679 --> 00:41:44.994
But this kind of
trans-generational effect is

00:41:44.994 --> 00:41:46.199
quite curious.
 

00:41:46.199 --> 00:41:51.304
In 1971, the effort to regulate
it was really pioneered by

00:41:51.304 --> 00:41:52.199
Vermont.
 

00:41:52.199 --> 00:41:55.840
Vermont passed a law banning
DDT use in the state.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.525
And they had formerly been
spraying it on their forests to

00:41:58.525 --> 00:41:59.750
control for gypsy moths.
 

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:04.876
That was followed in Wisconsin
in 1970 by a ban,

00:42:04.876 --> 00:42:08.260
in New York in 1971 by a ban.
 

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:11.655
And finally,
actually, the British also

00:42:11.655 --> 00:42:15.050
decided that this was not a
problem.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:18.155
That the support for
agriculture and the control of

00:42:18.155 --> 00:42:21.820
public health was so important
that it should continue to be

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:22.380
used.
 

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:26.349
Whereas the Soviets found that
it was worthy of a ban.

00:42:26.349 --> 00:42:29.179
They came out strongly in favor
of a ban.

00:42:29.179 --> 00:42:31.858
Finally, in 1972,
and remember,

00:42:31.858 --> 00:42:36.414
EPA was created in 1969,
it actually physically came

00:42:36.414 --> 00:42:38.469
into being in 1970.
 

00:42:38.469 --> 00:42:41.956
In 1972, William Ruckelshaus,
who was the former

00:42:41.956 --> 00:42:46.110
administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency,

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:49.501
decided that they should move
ahead because of the effects on

00:42:49.501 --> 00:42:52.583
wildlife,
but also the cancer threat to

00:42:52.583 --> 00:42:56.809
humans he felt was significant
enough to justify its

00:42:56.809 --> 00:42:57.969
regulation.
 

00:42:57.969 --> 00:43:02.530
And I know you can't read this,
but there's an interesting

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:04.715
phrase,
and this is in the New York

00:43:04.715 --> 00:43:10.253
Times,
that "Effective December

00:43:10.253 --> 00:43:11.800
31,1972.
 

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.989
In the meantime (he explained),
growers of cotton,

00:43:13.989 --> 00:43:15.922
peanuts, soybeans,
the three crops that account

00:43:15.922 --> 00:43:17.768
for almost the total domestic
use of DDT,

00:43:17.768 --> 00:43:20.313
will get instructions in the
handling of a substitute

00:43:20.313 --> 00:43:22.639
pesticide,
methyl parathion.

00:43:22.639 --> 00:43:27.751
The substitute is nontoxic,
but unlike DDT,

00:43:27.751 --> 00:43:31.159
it degrades quickly."
 

00:43:31.159 --> 00:43:34.914
So they're trading off a
persistent chemical for one that

00:43:34.914 --> 00:43:38.400
degrades quite quickly,
not really understanding what

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.679
the long-term effect might be.
 

00:43:40.679 --> 00:43:46.454
Curiously, the companies that
manufactured DDT said to

00:43:46.454 --> 00:43:49.135
themselves,
"Well, you know,

00:43:49.135 --> 00:43:52.434
is there a way that we could
modify the chemical structure of

00:43:52.434 --> 00:43:55.295
the compound and sell something
that would be a minor

00:43:55.295 --> 00:43:56.340
variant?"
 

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:59.929
And they produced a compound
known as dicophal that was only

00:43:59.929 --> 00:44:01.449
a little bit different.
 

00:44:01.449 --> 00:44:05.753
And lo and behold,
in all the parts of the country

00:44:05.753 --> 00:44:09.695
where dicophal was sprayed,
they found similar effects in

00:44:09.695 --> 00:44:11.570
wildlife,
particularly among large

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:12.090
raptors.
 

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:16.188
So in the Southwest and in the
South, where cotton is grown,

00:44:16.188 --> 00:44:20.010
they found dicophal building up
just the way DDT had.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:23.699
So it was lipophilic,
it was bio-accumulative,

00:44:23.699 --> 00:44:28.456
and basically became equally
worrisome to the Environmental

00:44:28.456 --> 00:44:30.260
Protection Agency.
 

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.139
So they banned DDT in '72.
 

00:44:32.139 --> 00:44:37.652
They got around to recognizing
that not only was dicophal

00:44:37.652 --> 00:44:42.331
having the same effects,
but it also was contaminated by

00:44:42.331 --> 00:44:46.376
DDT at a level of about fifteen
percent and that they needed to

00:44:46.376 --> 00:44:49.898
get that chemical out of the
food supply and out of the

00:44:49.898 --> 00:44:51.530
environment as well.
 

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:56.112
So it took until 1986 for them
to actually move ahead with the

00:44:56.112 --> 00:44:57.090
regulation.
 

00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:00.659
And then to work its way out of
production took until the early

00:45:00.659 --> 00:45:01.119
1990s.
 

00:45:01.119 --> 00:45:03.780
So this is the ban that wasn't
a ban.

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:08.557
The ban that took effect in '72
that really was not effective

00:45:08.557 --> 00:45:10.469
until the early 1990s.
 

00:45:10.469 --> 00:45:14.300
Now, if you then jump ahead,
fast forward to 1999,

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:18.157
you'll see that EPA is getting
around to studying methyl

00:45:18.157 --> 00:45:20.632
parathion--
the recommended substitute by

00:45:20.632 --> 00:45:25.152
William Ruckelshaus in 1972--
in 1999, EPA decided this

00:45:25.152 --> 00:45:30.260
chemical is more dangerous than
we thought.

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.132
In fact, methyl parathion is
responsible for more farm worker

00:45:33.132 --> 00:45:35.909
deaths and poisoning than any
other chemical in history.

00:45:35.909 --> 00:45:40.097
Not only is it far more acutely
toxic than DDT,

00:45:40.097 --> 00:45:44.650
but it also persisted longer
than they believed.

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:49.615
So one of the concerns that we
have today is what are we going

00:45:49.615 --> 00:45:53.849
to do with respect to the
persistence of malaria,

00:45:53.849 --> 00:45:58.730
but also its likely migration
into parts of the world where it

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:00.889
had been well controlled?
 

00:46:00.889 --> 00:46:03.130
And if you look at where
malaria exists now,

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:07.300
you'll see that malaria is a
problem predominately in the

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.882
tropical parts of the world,
also the poorest parts of the

00:46:10.882 --> 00:46:11.190
world.
 

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:14.878
And you'll see that the
expected range of malaria,

00:46:14.878 --> 00:46:18.793
of the different species of
mosquitoes that carry it,

00:46:18.793 --> 00:46:20.150
it's widening.
 

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:24.032
It's widening right now in
response to changing climatic

00:46:24.032 --> 00:46:24.949
conditions.
 

00:46:24.949 --> 00:46:28.226
So that the habitat is becoming
more favorable for disease

00:46:28.226 --> 00:46:29.090
transmission.
 

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:32.403
Now, the World Health
Organization recognized this and

00:46:32.403 --> 00:46:36.030
they called together a group of
people that were experts in

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:36.969
pesticides.
 

00:46:36.969 --> 00:46:39.820
And I'd worked on pesticides
for maybe fifteen years.

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:42.764
I'd worked with a group of
about seven other people,

00:46:42.764 --> 00:46:45.826
some from African nations,
to try to understand how to

00:46:45.826 --> 00:46:48.309
manage malaria,
particularly in Africa.

00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:51.596
WHO had gone along with the
bans of EPA and most other

00:46:51.596 --> 00:46:55.130
high-income nations in the world
and had phased it out.

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:59.170
It did not recommend the use of
DDT in any part of the world as

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:00.409
of the mid-1970s.
 

00:47:00.409 --> 00:47:03.925
But they wanted to reconsider
this, because it was so

00:47:03.925 --> 00:47:07.641
inexpensive, and it was so
effective, in part because it

00:47:07.641 --> 00:47:09.130
was so persistent.
 

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:11.697
They realized that if it was
sprayed both indoors and

00:47:11.697 --> 00:47:13.942
outdoors,
it would cause the insects to

00:47:13.942 --> 00:47:17.304
evolve resistant strains that
would be harder and harder for

00:47:17.304 --> 00:47:18.329
them to manage.
 

00:47:18.329 --> 00:47:22.907
In fact, many mosquitoes have
developed a resistance to DDT so

00:47:22.907 --> 00:47:26.809
that if they sprayed it on a
wall inside a house,

00:47:26.809 --> 00:47:30.039
the anopheles mosquito would
land on the wall,

00:47:30.039 --> 00:47:33.590
but it could sense it through
its feet and it would take off.

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:37.507
So it's a new behavioral
response that prevented it from

00:47:37.507 --> 00:47:39.360
absorbing a lethal dose.
 

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:42.452
So gradually,
the World Health Organization

00:47:42.452 --> 00:47:46.431
became concerned about
increasing incidence of malaria,

00:47:46.431 --> 00:47:48.420
particularly in Africa.
 

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:52.726
And it convened this group to
try to figure out whether or not

00:47:52.726 --> 00:47:56.539
it made sense to get behind DDT
and to use it again.

00:47:56.539 --> 00:48:02.038
And the next most effective
pesticide cost four times the

00:48:02.038 --> 00:48:05.047
level of DDT,
so this was a problem,

00:48:05.047 --> 00:48:08.840
and the aid agencies were not
willing to pay this increased

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:09.559
expense.
 

00:48:09.559 --> 00:48:16.320
So that WHO finally,
in 2006, gave DDT a clean bill

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.960
of health,
so to speak,

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:23.219
even though this group of
experts that convened in 2004,

00:48:23.219 --> 00:48:27.762
this group found that well,
using DDT is really not a good

00:48:27.762 --> 00:48:28.320
idea.
 

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:31.512
You should use a less toxic
chemical, one that is less

00:48:31.512 --> 00:48:34.101
persistent, that would be
equally effective,

00:48:34.101 --> 00:48:35.909
even though it costs more.
 

00:48:35.909 --> 00:48:39.561
So it's a matter of finding the
money in order to pay for the

00:48:39.561 --> 00:48:43.030
chemical that would protect
human health and environmental

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:46.317
quality at the same time it
would deal with the malaria

00:48:46.317 --> 00:48:47.170
problem.
 

00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:50.489
So, I'm at time and I'm going
to stop there.

00:48:50.489 --> 00:48:54.125
And we'll come back on Thursday
and take a closer look at the

00:48:54.125 --> 00:48:57.639
variety of laws that apply to
food safety in the nation.

00:48:57.639 --> 00:48:59.360
Thank you.
 

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:05.000

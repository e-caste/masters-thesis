00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.030
Prof: Okay,
let's start up.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.150
So remember we were talking
about configuration,

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.319
about handedness,
which was introduced - the idea

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:15.150
was introduced - in the context
of a tetrahedral carbon.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.892
But you don't need a
tetrahedral carbon in order to

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:18.880
have handedness.
 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.926
And an example is shown by the
oxidation of a sulfide to a

00:00:24.926 --> 00:00:26.200
sulfoxide.
 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.080
So let's first talk about the
mechanism.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.350
What makes the sulfide reactive
in this case?

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.340
What do you see for an orbital
that would make the compound on

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.190
the top left?
 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.910
Russell?
 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.400
Student:  High HOMO.
 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.230
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.330
Student:  High HOMO.
 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.900
Prof: High HOMO,
the unshared pair on sulfur.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.290
And how about the peroxy?
 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.670
Notice that's not a normal
benzoic acid.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.540
It's got two oxygens in a row.
 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.210
What reactivity does that
confer on it?

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.500
Devin, you got an idea,
two oxygens in a row?

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.450
What's going to be unusual in
terms of an orbital?

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.750
We're looking,
obviously, for a low LUMO.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.319
Student:  It's probably
going to be a higher HOMO.

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:08.691
Prof: Yeah,
it'll have -- it has unshared

00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:09.599
pairs, no doubt.
 

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:12.575
But we want it to react with
the sulfur that has unshared

00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:13.000
pairs.
 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.379
So we're looking for a low LUMO.
 

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:15.489
Anybody got an idea?
 

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:18.250
Russell?
 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.366
Student: 
σ*,

00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:20.855
between --
Prof: σ* of

00:01:20.855 --> 00:01:22.659
the oxygens, because oxygen's
got a big nuclear charge,

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:22.959
right?
 

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:24.129
So its orbitals are low.
 

00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:26.549
Okay, so we have the unshared
pair on sulfur,

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.738
σ* on the oxygen,
and we get one of these where

00:01:29.738 --> 00:01:32.110
we make a bond and break a bond
at the same time,

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.360
which puts on oxygen onto the
sulfur.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.816
And notice that,
as you said Devin,

00:01:37.816 --> 00:01:44.120
the oxygen has unshared pairs,
the n electrons there.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.802
But those won't give
stabilization by mixing with an

00:01:47.802 --> 00:01:49.680
unshared pair on sulfur.
 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.760
But sulfur's in the next row of
the periodic table.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.510
So it has a vacant d
orbital that can overlap with

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.980
that.
 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.506
So you can get partial
stabilization there,

00:01:59.506 --> 00:02:02.875
of the unshared pair on oxygen,
which you could denote by

00:02:02.875 --> 00:02:04.438
drawing a double bond.
 

00:02:04.438 --> 00:02:04.789
Right?
 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.468
So we sometimes draw a double
bond to sulfur.

00:02:07.468 --> 00:02:12.105
And we can lose the proton from
that, and we get what's called a

00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:12.990
sulfoxide.
 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.300
So there's the mechanism of
making a sulfoxide.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.430
And notice that it's not planar
at the sulfur.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.348
Even though the sulfur has only
three substituents,

00:02:21.348 --> 00:02:22.400
it's not planar.
 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.650
So it's asymmetric.
 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.360
It's hande;, it's chiral.
 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.723
Right?
 

00:02:27.723 --> 00:02:31.051
And obviously you could easily
well have reacted the top

00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:34.685
unshared pair of the starting
material, as well as the bottom

00:02:34.685 --> 00:02:35.229
one.
 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:38.319
So when you do the reaction you
get a racemate,

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.740
a 50:50 mixture of the
sulfoxides.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.960
Okay, now we mentioned
omeprazole last time.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.400
Here's the chemical structure
of omeprazole.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.930
What will make it reactive?
 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.440
Anybody got a hint for what
might make it reactive?

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.780
Elizabeth?
 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.210
Student:  A lone pair on
nitrogen.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.720
Prof: It's got a lone
pair on two nitrogens.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.189
Student:  Right.
 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:01.699
Prof: Right? Okay.
 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:06.388
Now one way to discriminate
between them is to protonate one

00:03:06.388 --> 00:03:07.024
of them.
 

00:03:07.024 --> 00:03:07.740
Right?
 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.935
Because when you do that,
you now have this

00:03:10.935 --> 00:03:13.064
carbon-nitrogen double bond.
 

00:03:13.064 --> 00:03:13.750
Right?
 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.294
And the π* will be
unusually low because of the

00:03:17.294 --> 00:03:20.080
positive charge that came from
the proton.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.250
So acid is the stuff that's
going to activate this.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.125
So now you've got a low LUMO
and also the high HOMO,

00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:28.550
from the other unshared pair on
nitrogen.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.836
So bingo, you can add,
just as the nitrogen would add

00:03:32.836 --> 00:03:35.639
to a C=O double bond,
like that.

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.266
Then you get this thing with
now four bonds to that central

00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:39.830
carbon.
 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.622
Protonate again,
and now this compound has two

00:03:45.622 --> 00:03:48.068
positive charges.
 

00:03:48.068 --> 00:03:50.319
That's not so great,
to have a dication.

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.870
So you get rid of it.
 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.550
You can get rid of it by losing
that original proton.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.268
But there's another proton you
can lose, just as easily,

00:03:59.268 --> 00:04:00.468
in this way.
 

00:04:00.468 --> 00:04:01.006
Right?
 

00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:05.741
So lose the proton on the
nitrogen and then have those

00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:10.030
electrons re-form the double
bond to carbon,

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.919
and the electrons go out on
sulfur,

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.270
and you get this thing.
 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.629
Now, that happens -- remember
it's the acid coming along;

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:21.660
the H+^( )is what caused this
to happen to omeprazole.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.425
So if you have a pH,
an acid pH between one and

00:04:24.425 --> 00:04:27.372
three, omeprazole will undergo
this acid-catalyzed

00:04:27.372 --> 00:04:29.598
rearrangement,
with a half-life of two

00:04:29.598 --> 00:04:30.439
minutes.
 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:33.440
So in no time at all it's
converted to this form,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.129
which is the active form.
 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:37.360
Now active to what?
 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.529
Well suppose you have an enzyme
that has a sulfur on it,

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:43.870
that's got an unshared pair of
electrons, that will make it

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:44.620
reactive.
 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.846
What will make the drug,
in this form,

00:04:46.846 --> 00:04:47.509
reactive?
 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.800
Anybody got an idea?
 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.773
Russell, I'm going to go to you
again, because you answered the

00:04:54.773 --> 00:04:56.990
same question before.
 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.889
We just made this group here.
 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.439
Student:  Yes,
that's right.

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:01.970
Prof: What's going to
make it reactive?

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.240
Student:  π*
makes it --

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.709
Prof: Not π*,
no.

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:07.870
Student: 
&gt;.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.220
Prof: It's the same as
O-O, right?

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.819
Sulfur is right below oxygen.
 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:12.500
Student:  I meant to say
σ*,

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.487
Prof: Can you see that?
 

00:05:13.487 --> 00:05:14.276
So it's σ*.
 

00:05:14.276 --> 00:05:15.430
Oh, that's what you meant to
say.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.862
Student:  Yeah..
 

00:05:15.862 --> 00:05:16.519
Prof: σ*
S-O.

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:19.769
Okay, so we got that low LUMO
and the high HOMO on the sulfur

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:20.420
coming in.
 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.939
So we can do exactly the same
reaction as before,

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:23.360
right?
 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.560
Make a bond, break a bond.
 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.149
OH- goes away.
 

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.567
Right?
 

00:05:26.567 --> 00:05:30.754
And we have this thing where
we've now formed a covalent bond

00:05:30.754 --> 00:05:32.079
with the enzyme.
 

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:35.295
So the enzyme can't do its
stuff anymore,

00:05:35.295 --> 00:05:35.940
right?
 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.889
Because it's tied up.
 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.139
Okay?
 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.142
So the pump,
the pump which takes acid

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:48.012
that's made in the cells that
line the stomach and transports

00:05:48.012 --> 00:05:51.766
the acid into the stomach,
doesn't work anymore,

00:05:51.766 --> 00:05:54.300
because that enzyme is what did
the trick.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.069
So the pump enzyme is
inactivated and the flow of HCl

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:00.100
to the stomach is stopped.
 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.610
Okay?
 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.923
And, in fact,
this is an interesting problem

00:06:04.923 --> 00:06:10.437
in the design of the drug,
because it's acid that causes

00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:13.110
this to happen,
in two minutes,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.459
to become the active form.
 

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:17.387
But you don't want it to happen
until it gets into the cells

00:06:17.387 --> 00:06:18.579
that line the stomach.
 

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:21.500
So you take the pill orally,
it goes into the stomach.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.461
What problem are you suffering
from, when you put the -- when

00:06:24.461 --> 00:06:25.500
you take this pill?
 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.709
Student: Acid.
 

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:28.610
Prof: Acid,
in your stomach.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.428
So bingo, it's going to happen
in the stomach,

00:06:30.428 --> 00:06:32.290
not in the cells in the wall of
the stomach.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.754
So they have to coat it with
something that'll make it get

00:06:35.754 --> 00:06:39.160
through the stomach first
without doing its reaction,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.470
and so they say don't grind the
pill up --

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.459
right?
 

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:43.209
-- before you take it.
 

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:44.339
Let it get through.
 

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:47.009
Then it gets through the liver,
into the bloodstream,

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:50.949
and comes back to the wall of
these cells in the stomach,

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:54.062
and then it gets activated by
acid and does this trick and

00:06:54.062 --> 00:06:56.629
stops the acid from pumping into
the stomach.

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:57.690
So that's the idea.
 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.153
Okay, now should a chiral
switch, to a single enantiomer

00:07:02.153 --> 00:07:05.238
-- omeprazole,
Prilosec, is a racemate,

00:07:05.238 --> 00:07:08.810
it's a 50:50 mixture of the
enantiomers;

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.298
enantiomers,
remember, at sulfur,

00:07:11.298 --> 00:07:12.387
not at carbon.
 

00:07:12.387 --> 00:07:13.009
Okay?
 

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:17.052
Now, if you go to a single
enantiomer, will the drug be

00:07:17.052 --> 00:07:19.750
twice as good,
or at least better?

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.790
Can anybody see a problem that
you would have?

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.370
Right?
 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.845
When something interacts with
an enzyme, the enzyme is a

00:07:31.845 --> 00:07:32.730
single hand.
 

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.214
So the complex,
the reacting complex,

00:07:35.214 --> 00:07:38.874
between the enzyme and the
stuff that you're reacting,

00:07:38.874 --> 00:07:42.050
is diastereomeric if that stuff
is handed;

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.560
if it's right or left-handed.
 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.300
The enzyme say is all
right-handed.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.779
So you have right-right,
or right-left.

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:49.490
One of them will be better than
the other.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.910
Right?
 

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.589
So is that going to be
something that'll be important

00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.949
here?
 

00:07:53.949 --> 00:07:57.105
If we make a single enantiomer
of omeprazole -- remember,

00:07:57.105 --> 00:07:59.810
we talked about thalidomide,
ibuprofen before.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.778
Will a single enantiomer likely
help?

00:08:02.778 --> 00:08:05.968
There's an interesting
observation about this compound,

00:08:05.968 --> 00:08:08.565
the active form,
that makes it different from

00:08:08.565 --> 00:08:10.220
the original omeprazole.
 

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.209
Do you see what it is?
 

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.423
Incidentally,
notice, that's the original

00:08:17.423 --> 00:08:18.278
omeprazole.
 

00:08:18.278 --> 00:08:21.658
All that that mechanism I
showed you did was to change

00:08:21.658 --> 00:08:25.548
that bond from there to there,
and the proton from nitrogen to

00:08:25.548 --> 00:08:26.250
sulfur.
 

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.410
Let's go back again.
 

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.589
That's all that happened during
the activation.

00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:34.149
But it did something crucial
with respect to stereochemistry.

00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:36.049
How about that original form?
 

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:36.950
Was it chiral?
 

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:37.809
Student:  Yes.
 

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.019
Prof: Why? Angela?
 

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:43.279
What made it chiral? Yeah?
 

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:48.655
Student:  The bond is
going -- like it can either go

00:08:48.655 --> 00:08:50.509
inside or outside.
 

00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:51.274
Prof: Right.
 

00:08:51.274 --> 00:08:53.687
The bond -- the oxygen on the
sulfur could be either going in

00:08:53.687 --> 00:08:56.658
or out;
the sulfur is pyramidal.

00:08:56.658 --> 00:08:58.750
What happened when we activated
it?

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.090
Student:  It gets bigger.
 

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.558
Prof: Now it's not
chiral anymore.

00:09:02.558 --> 00:09:05.597
So this thing is not going to
discriminate between anything,

00:09:05.597 --> 00:09:07.350
because it's not chiral
anymore.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:08.480
Okay?
 

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.970
So this thing is achiral.
 

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:12.264
Okay?
 

00:09:12.264 --> 00:09:15.325
So it shouldn't make any
difference which hand you're

00:09:15.325 --> 00:09:16.678
using at this stage.
 

00:09:16.678 --> 00:09:20.057
Now, so there's no difference
after omeprazole has been

00:09:20.057 --> 00:09:21.308
activated by acid.
 

00:09:21.308 --> 00:09:23.798
Notice it's not activated by an
enzyme,

00:09:23.798 --> 00:09:26.460
because if it were activated by
an enzyme,

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.535
then it could discriminate
between the two hands and one

00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:31.830
would be more activated than the
other.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.138
Right?
 

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:33.730
So that could be a difference.
 

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:35.048
But that's not true.
 

00:09:35.048 --> 00:09:38.908
It's just acid that does the
activation and makes it achiral.

00:09:38.908 --> 00:09:41.408
So at first glance one would
think it'd make no difference at

00:09:41.408 --> 00:09:41.658
all.
 

00:09:41.658 --> 00:09:45.111
Still, it could be that one
enantiomer is better at getting

00:09:45.111 --> 00:09:48.682
through the digestive system and
getting back to the stomach,

00:09:48.682 --> 00:09:50.409
in order to do the trick.
 

00:09:50.409 --> 00:09:52.259
So it's still possible.
 

00:09:52.259 --> 00:09:55.250
How could you tell whether it's
better or not?

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:59.230
This is getting pretty
complicated -- right?

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.628
-- all the different things it
would go through to get from

00:10:01.628 --> 00:10:02.288
here to there.
 

00:10:02.288 --> 00:10:05.638
How would you find out whether
it's worth using a single

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:06.429
enantiomer?
 

00:10:06.429 --> 00:10:07.840
What would you do?
 

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.870
Student:  Test it.
 

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.299
Prof: Test it. How?
 

00:10:11.299 --> 00:10:12.158
Student:  Clinical trial.
 

00:10:12.158 --> 00:10:13.975
Prof: You'd do a
clinical trial.

00:10:13.975 --> 00:10:14.308
Okay.
 

00:10:14.308 --> 00:10:17.876
So you need -- but in order to
do that, you need a single

00:10:17.876 --> 00:10:21.445
enantiomer in order to do the
laboratory and the clinical

00:10:21.445 --> 00:10:22.210
testing.
 

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.649
And we're going to talk about
that in just a second.

00:10:24.649 --> 00:10:28.570
But first let's talk just a bit
about the economics of this.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:32.567
These things called proton pump
inhibitors are the newest

00:10:32.567 --> 00:10:35.710
generation of things to treat
acid reflux.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:40.380
And here's data from Wellmark,
which is the Blue Cross/Blue

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:44.898
Shield of Iowa and South Dakota;
so a pretty small population

00:10:44.898 --> 00:10:45.279
area.
 

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:48.976
And this is how many
prescriptions they wrote for

00:10:48.976 --> 00:10:52.288
Prilosec in the period from 1999
to 2003;

00:10:52.288 --> 00:10:56.389
just went up by 250% to a
quarter of a million.

00:10:56.389 --> 00:11:00.828
And if you go world -- so 15%
of the members of Wellmark got

00:11:00.828 --> 00:11:07.789
this stuff, as of 2003;
and 600 million worldwide.

00:11:07.789 --> 00:11:10.210
That's a big market. Right?
 

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:14.220
So now here's cost comparison
for things that treat acid

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:14.950
stomach.
 

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.860
So the first stuff is Tums and
Rolaids and so on.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.548
Those cost three or four cents
apiece.

00:11:20.548 --> 00:11:24.330
Okay, then there are these
over-the-counter H_2 blockers,

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.029
like Zantac,
which are now very cheap;

00:11:27.029 --> 00:11:28.259
like thirty-seven cents.
 

00:11:28.259 --> 00:11:31.508
But they didn't used to be,
because they used to be covered

00:11:31.508 --> 00:11:33.634
by patent, and were prescription
drugs.

00:11:33.634 --> 00:11:34.139
Okay.
 

00:11:34.139 --> 00:11:37.640
Then there are prescription
versions you see of these H_2

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.642
blockers, and Zantac,
when it's for prescription,

00:11:40.642 --> 00:11:42.080
costs $4.27 apiece.
 

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.639
Okay, but now these proton pump
inhibitors come along.

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:52.379
And in 1988 Prilosec came on
the market at $4.61 a pop.

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:56.120
You take one every day. Okay?
 

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.908
But in 2002 the patent ran out.
 

00:12:00.908 --> 00:12:04.918
So now generic people started
selling the generic version of

00:12:04.918 --> 00:12:07.407
omeprazole for $2.76,
and AstraZeneca,

00:12:07.407 --> 00:12:10.370
the manufacturer of Prilosec,
said we can do better than that;

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.352
we've been making this stuff
for years, so we'll make an OTC

00:12:13.352 --> 00:12:15.778
version and have Proctor &amp;
Gamble sell it.

00:12:15.778 --> 00:12:19.450
And so in 2003 they introduced
Prilosec OTC;

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.206
which was actually exactly the
same stuff but seventy-nine

00:12:22.206 --> 00:12:22.833
cents a pill.
 

00:12:22.833 --> 00:12:23.269
Right?
 

00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:25.926
But you can still get the
prescription form,

00:12:25.926 --> 00:12:28.830
if you want the real thing,
for $4.61 a pill.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.820
Okay, but so now you're losing
a big market.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.490
If your pills are costing only
something like what?;

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.570
1/6th or 1/7th of what they
originally cost.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:43.827
So in 2000, AstraZeneca
introduced Nexium,

00:12:43.827 --> 00:12:46.839
which is a single enantiomer.
 

00:12:46.839 --> 00:12:47.668
Okay?
 

00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:50.548
And now that's $4.87 a pill.
 

00:12:50.548 --> 00:12:51.269
Right?
 

00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:53.460
And that process,
to go from the R/S to

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.476
the S,
to go from the racemate to a

00:12:55.476 --> 00:12:57.405
single enantiomer,
is called a "chiral

00:12:57.405 --> 00:12:59.509
switch",
in the industry;

00:12:59.509 --> 00:13:03.313
to go from a racemate to a
single enantiomer.

00:13:03.313 --> 00:13:03.918
Okay.
 

00:13:03.918 --> 00:13:07.380
Now this was touted,
within AstraZeneca,

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.778
as the most successful U.S.
 

00:13:09.778 --> 00:13:11.110
launch ever.
 

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.427
And here you can see the graph
of how much better it is than

00:13:14.427 --> 00:13:16.960
Viagra, Vioxx,
Lipitor, Celebrex and so on.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.741
Over this little more than
three-year period it went up to

00:13:20.741 --> 00:13:22.798
eight billion dollars in sales.
 

00:13:22.798 --> 00:13:23.330
Okay?
 

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:28.032
And you can see that there's
been a lot of integration of

00:13:28.032 --> 00:13:32.399
clinical and commercial
enterprise at AstraZeneca.

00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:35.549
This is from a website that you
can see there.

00:13:35.549 --> 00:13:38.596
In December 2003 they say:
"…the executive

00:13:38.596 --> 00:13:41.475
director and development brand
leader" (at AstraZeneca)

00:13:41.475 --> 00:13:44.110
"adds the clinical and
scientific proficiency as a

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:45.720
research gastroenterologist.
 

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.674
As Levine and his staff put
together clinical development

00:13:48.674 --> 00:13:51.096
plans,
such as additional indications

00:13:51.096 --> 00:13:53.985
or line extensions,
they get commercial input at

00:13:53.985 --> 00:13:55.019
every stage."
 

00:13:55.019 --> 00:13:58.913
Well I don't know if you
noticed I drink water every once

00:13:58.913 --> 00:14:01.210
awhile because my mouth is dry.
 

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.513
And just before -- when I
learned that the class was going

00:14:04.513 --> 00:14:07.322
to be filmed this year,
I realized that I'd been

00:14:07.322 --> 00:14:09.820
suffering from hoarseness since
last spring,

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.720
and I figured that wouldn't be
good for the recording.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.469
So I went to see a doctor to
find out if I could do anything

00:14:15.469 --> 00:14:17.658
about this, whether there was
anything wrong.

00:14:17.658 --> 00:14:23.604
Now there's something you can
do for this, and Nexium has been

00:14:23.604 --> 00:14:27.990
the most intensively advertised
stuff ever.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.580
Right? That was for the public.
 

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.970
This is for doctors.
 

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:32.860
Okay?
 

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:37.471
So if you go to that website,
you can see a seven-part,

00:14:37.471 --> 00:14:42.511
seven-scene description of why
Nexium is so much better than

00:14:42.511 --> 00:14:44.048
anything else.
 

00:14:44.048 --> 00:14:48.662
And what I'd like you to do for
a homework problem for Wednesday

00:14:48.662 --> 00:14:52.908
is to go through that show and
evaluate whether this series

00:14:52.908 --> 00:14:55.908
shows that Nexium is superior or
not.

00:14:55.908 --> 00:14:58.929
Is it worth paying five times
as much for a pill,

00:14:58.929 --> 00:15:01.070
or six times as much for a
pill?

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:10.090
Now, this is the FDA-approved
label for Nexium.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.210
And so they did clinical
trials, just as we said they

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:13.928
should do.
 

00:15:13.928 --> 00:15:18.970
Okay, so here they tried to
heal erosive esophagitis.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.841
So what they tested,
you can see,

00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:23.298
is the healing rate for this
condition,

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:27.548
from 40 mg of Nexium,
20 mg of Nexium --

00:15:27.548 --> 00:15:29.860
so that's the single enantiomer
in two different doses --

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.730
or the traditional omeprazole,
the racemic stuff.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:37.432
So, "These were evaluated
in patients with endoscopically

00:15:37.432 --> 00:15:40.649
diagnosed erosive esophagitis in
four multicenter,

00:15:40.649 --> 00:15:42.798
double-blind,
randomized studies.

00:15:42.798 --> 00:15:45.682
The healing rates after 4 and 8
weeks were evaluated and shown

00:15:45.682 --> 00:15:46.960
in the table below."
 

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.860
Now suppose you were in charge
of designing this test.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.340
How much of the racemate,
omeprazole --

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:59.668
so 40 mg and 20 mg of Nexium --
but compared to omeprazole,

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:03.370
how much would you have
administered to compare with --

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:05.529
so there are the single
enantiomer,

00:16:05.529 --> 00:16:07.330
40 mg or 20 mg.
 

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.769
How much omeprazole would you
use?

00:16:09.769 --> 00:16:11.419
Student:  Forty and
twenty.

00:16:11.419 --> 00:16:13.750
Prof: And why?
 

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.629
Lucas, what do you say?
 

00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:19.110
Student:  20 mg,
as little as possible.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.580
Prof:
&gt;

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:20.840
Why?
 

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.086
Student:  To show the
best distinction between the new

00:16:23.086 --> 00:16:24.058
stuff and the old stuff.
 

00:16:24.058 --> 00:16:25.918
Prof: Okay.
 

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:29.330
Does everybody agree with
Lucas?

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:30.808
Kate, what would you choose?
 

00:16:30.808 --> 00:16:36.110
Student:  Well I'd want
to do both twenty and forty.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.830
But it looks like there's only
one omeprazole.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.750
Prof: Okay,
but if you were designing the

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.139
test, you'd do twenty and forty.
 

00:16:42.139 --> 00:16:45.059
We'll have an auction here.
 

00:16:45.059 --> 00:16:46.659
Do I hear eighty from anyone?
 

00:16:46.659 --> 00:16:49.072
Rick you --
Student:  I would do

00:16:49.072 --> 00:16:49.750
eighty and forty.
 

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:51.129
Prof: eighty and forty.
 

00:16:51.129 --> 00:16:51.360
Why?
 

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.105
Student:  Because that
way -- because so omeprazole is

00:16:54.105 --> 00:16:54.700
a racemate.
 

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.548
If you do eighty and forty of
those, you would get forty and

00:16:57.548 --> 00:16:58.899
twenty of the active form.
 

00:16:58.899 --> 00:16:59.758
Prof: Okay.
 

00:16:59.758 --> 00:17:01.620
Does everybody see what Rick's
saying?

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.468
If you want the same amount of
what is ostensibly the active

00:17:04.468 --> 00:17:07.220
stuff, you should have double
the amount of omeprazole.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.599
Now this is what the label
says, what was actually used;

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:10.869
20 mg.
 

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:12.150
You win Lucas.
 

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.259
Okay? Now why?
 

00:17:15.259 --> 00:17:19.640
It's because that's the
approved dose for that disease.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.086
Right?
 

00:17:20.086 --> 00:17:22.838
That's what the FDA approved,
right?

00:17:22.838 --> 00:17:27.077
But we'll give twice or four
times as much of what we think

00:17:27.077 --> 00:17:31.609
to be the active ingredient to
the other people in the test.

00:17:31.609 --> 00:17:32.750
Okay, so that's the test.
 

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.368
There were four different
tests, and this shows it.

00:17:35.368 --> 00:17:38.213
But let's summarize it with a
graph that'll show it I think

00:17:38.213 --> 00:17:38.950
more clearly.
 

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:43.424
So after four weeks and after
eight weeks, these are what

00:17:43.424 --> 00:17:47.182
fraction of healing there was
with the racemate,

00:17:47.182 --> 00:17:49.980
which is shown in open figures.
 

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.150
And the shapes are different
studies;

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:53.750
remember, there were four
different studies.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:57.346
And this is what you get if you
use the single enantiomer,

00:17:57.346 --> 00:17:59.987
is 20 mg;
which remember is twice the

00:17:59.987 --> 00:18:02.440
dose, if that one form is
active.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.368
What would you conclude from
this?

00:18:05.368 --> 00:18:09.230
Is it worth paying seven times
as much, or six times as much?

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.210
Student:  No.
 

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.858
Prof: Okay now -- or you
could use 40 mg.

00:18:13.858 --> 00:18:16.741
Now I think we would probably
agree that it's better,

00:18:16.741 --> 00:18:19.182
just eyeballing this thing,
even if we aren't

00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:20.180
statisticians.
 

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:20.726
Okay?
 

00:18:20.726 --> 00:18:25.318
So four times the dose does a
better job.

00:18:25.318 --> 00:18:27.548
Now, then this was heavily
advertised.

00:18:27.548 --> 00:18:29.990
You may have seen these things
for the purple pill.

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:36.529
So you get this grey-haired guy
here who says,

00:18:36.529 --> 00:18:39.317
"If I told you
prescription Nexium heals acid

00:18:39.317 --> 00:18:41.650
reflux damage better,
you'd want proof.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:44.990
And now your doctor has that
proof.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.086
Recent medical studies prove
Nexium heals better than the

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:50.519
other leading prescription
medicine."

00:18:50.519 --> 00:18:52.798
(Now notice,
he says prescription medicine.

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:55.859
The OTC stuff isn't a
prescription medicine.

00:18:55.859 --> 00:18:58.298
So this is a different test.)
 

00:18:58.298 --> 00:19:01.140
"No wonder they call
Nexium the healing purple pill.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.394
So call your doctor today,
because if left untreated the

00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:06.230
damage could get worse."
 

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:09.450
So you can get a purple pill
there.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.243
Okay, this is the test he was
referring to,

00:19:12.243 --> 00:19:15.038
which compared esomeprazole,
that's Nexium,

00:19:15.038 --> 00:19:16.368
to lansoprazole.
 

00:19:16.368 --> 00:19:19.400
But again it's 40 mg versus 30
mg.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.606
I don't know anything about
lansoprazole,

00:19:21.606 --> 00:19:23.650
but that's what they tested
anyhow.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:26.189
But notice incidentally,
in the acknowledgements,

00:19:26.189 --> 00:19:28.940
this study was supported by a
grant from AstraZeneca,

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.210
Wayne, Pennsylvania.
 

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.964
So these are not completely
disinterested people,

00:19:32.964 --> 00:19:36.180
at least some of them,
who are involved in this study.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.250
And it says,
"So call your doctor today

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.598
to learn about this."
 

00:19:39.598 --> 00:19:44.048
And fortunately we have my
doctor here, Dr. Duffey.

00:19:44.048 --> 00:19:45.523
So she's going to give you her
perspective

00:19:45.523 --> 00:19:46.460
&gt;
 

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.440
on Nexium and omeprazole.
 

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.720
Thank you for coming.
 

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.358
Dr. Dianne Duffey:
 My pleasure Professor

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:51.637
McBride.
 

00:19:51.637 --> 00:19:52.650
Thank you for having me.
 

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:57.450
&lt;&lt;Technical
adjustments&gt;&gt;

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.428
Dr. Dianne Duffey:
 Well I can remember

00:19:59.428 --> 00:20:01.538
sitting in organic chemistry
classe as a pre-med,

00:20:01.538 --> 00:20:04.308
wondering why it was I needed
to learn how to make paint.

00:20:04.308 --> 00:20:07.200
So this is a real treat for me
to be here today,

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.238
to be able to talk to you about
some clinical aspects of why

00:20:10.238 --> 00:20:13.173
it's important to study and do
well in Professor McBride's

00:20:13.173 --> 00:20:13.690
class.
 

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.430
Sorry.
 

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.355
All right, so I'm a
otolaryngologist,

00:20:18.355 --> 00:20:22.907
I'm an ear, nose and throat
physician, and I work here at

00:20:22.907 --> 00:20:23.640
Yale.
 

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.200
Some of you may recognize me
from the health plan.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.108
And Professor McBride did give
me permission today to talk a

00:20:29.108 --> 00:20:30.490
little bit about his case.
 

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:34.064
So I'm not going to show you
any confidential pictures,

00:20:34.064 --> 00:20:36.910
but I may allude to him here in
the talk.

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:38.690
So first of all the disclosure.
 

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.077
I don't have any financial
interest in any of the drugs or

00:20:41.077 --> 00:20:42.250
companies discussed today.
 

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.858
I'm not on any speakers'
bureaus.

00:20:43.858 --> 00:20:46.374
So, in a word,
I don't really have a vested

00:20:46.374 --> 00:20:48.769
interest in anything shown here
today.

00:20:48.769 --> 00:20:51.534
But I will discuss some
off-label or experimental uses

00:20:51.534 --> 00:20:52.630
of these compounds.
 

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:56.798
And the opinions presented by
me are mine and no one else's.

00:20:56.798 --> 00:21:00.655
So as you've heard testified
here today, Professor McBride

00:21:00.655 --> 00:21:03.430
took Prilosec and actually did
improve.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.434
So he sent me an email and was
very excited that I could come

00:21:06.434 --> 00:21:09.339
and speak to you all today,
and said, "By the way,

00:21:09.339 --> 00:21:11.298
my symptoms were improved."
 

00:21:11.298 --> 00:21:16.460
So Prilosec fixes symptoms of
GE reflux disease,

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.968
gastroesophageal reflux
disease, and laryngopharyngeal

00:21:19.968 --> 00:21:22.593
reflux disease,
which is the entity that I

00:21:22.593 --> 00:21:22.980
treat.
 

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.909
GE reflux disease is in the
domain primarily of the

00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:27.140
gastroenterologist.
 

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:31.556
So I'm going to refer mostly to
LPR today, laryngopharyngeal

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:32.230
reflux.
 

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.930
So we've heard that Prilosec
works.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:37.130
Or does it?
 

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:38.558
We really need to know.
 

00:21:38.558 --> 00:21:40.618
How is it we know these drugs
work?

00:21:40.618 --> 00:21:42.940
Someone talked about clinical
trials today,

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.940
and I'm going to focus a little
bit more closely on that,

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.460
because that's -- we rely on
these,

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.088
and they come primarily from
pharma.

00:21:49.088 --> 00:21:52.036
Yale University,
my clinic, doesn't really have

00:21:52.036 --> 00:21:55.880
the money to run extensive
clinical trials on my patients.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.461
Sometimes some centers are able
to do it, or you may have a

00:21:59.461 --> 00:22:02.240
grant to do something that looks
at a drug.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.719
But primarily we're relying on
what the pharmaceutical

00:22:04.719 --> 00:22:06.450
companies tell us in terms of
data.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:10.375
So about Prilosec working in
him, all we know is that his

00:22:10.375 --> 00:22:14.451
symptoms are improved --
they were in his body -- eating

00:22:14.451 --> 00:22:16.414
his diet,
and living his life,

00:22:16.414 --> 00:22:18.980
and taking the drug at the
prescribed dose.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.134
But there are a lot of
variables that we may not know

00:22:22.134 --> 00:22:24.054
about,
and some of these variables are

00:22:24.054 --> 00:22:26.450
what the pharma companies need
to take into account,

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:27.940
when they're doing these
clinical trials,

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:28.900
when they're designing them.
 

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.190
Are we taking other patient
variables into account?

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:35.037
For example, diet;
does he take a large number of

00:22:35.037 --> 00:22:37.400
herbal supplements we don't know
about, for example?

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.170
This could affect the
pharmacodynamics.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:43.038
It could affect the
pharmacokinetics of the drug in

00:22:43.038 --> 00:22:43.670
his body.
 

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:47.000
Did he take the prescribed
medication on an empty stomach,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.450
as it's supposed to be taken,
so that the acid will activate

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:51.210
it early?
 

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.490
In other words,
was he compliant?

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:56.337
And these are all things that I
need to be taking into account

00:22:56.337 --> 00:22:58.160
when I prescribe a drug to a
patient.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.829
For example,
these studies were done in

00:22:59.829 --> 00:23:02.028
patient populations,
but they may have been done on

00:23:02.028 --> 00:23:03.832
the West Coast,
they may have been done in

00:23:03.832 --> 00:23:04.358
China.
 

00:23:04.358 --> 00:23:07.558
Is that patient population
representative of my patient

00:23:07.558 --> 00:23:08.328
population?
 

00:23:08.328 --> 00:23:11.840
So when they're designing these
trials, they try to control for

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.730
as many patient individual
variables as possible.

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:16.737
In addition,
these studies have to be

00:23:16.737 --> 00:23:19.775
statistically sound,
because biostatistics drive

00:23:19.775 --> 00:23:22.440
these clinical trials and their
design,

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.824
so that if differences are
actually observed between

00:23:25.824 --> 00:23:28.685
Prilosec and a placebo,
or Prilosec versus

00:23:28.685 --> 00:23:31.462
esomeprazole,
we have to be able to determine

00:23:31.462 --> 00:23:35.250
with reasonable certainty if
these differences are real or if

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.650
they're due to just chance
alone.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:39.358
So that's where biostatistics
comes in.

00:23:39.358 --> 00:23:43.730
And I submit -- and I think
Professor McBride,

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:45.598
who helped write some of these
slides,

00:23:45.598 --> 00:23:48.838
probably also feels -- that
there is some duty on the part,

00:23:48.838 --> 00:23:52.578
not only of the manufacturers,
but of academic institutions,

00:23:52.578 --> 00:23:54.348
who are also running their own
clinical trials,

00:23:54.348 --> 00:23:58.680
to actually design the studies
so that it's easy to understand;

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.915
the data are there and they're
very clear, so that they can

00:24:01.915 --> 00:24:04.538
make also very legitimate
head-to-head marketing

00:24:04.538 --> 00:24:07.048
comparisons between competitor
compounds.

00:24:07.048 --> 00:24:09.460
So I think this is very
important.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:12.009
As a physician,
I feel that I have a duty to

00:24:12.009 --> 00:24:14.618
really evaluate the literature
critically.

00:24:14.618 --> 00:24:16.890
Sometimes I actually need to go
back and pull the studies.

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:19.229
I can look at the package
insert, for these drugs,

00:24:19.229 --> 00:24:21.759
but how do I know -- how can I
actually believe it?

00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:25.334
So sometimes I actually go back
and I'll pull the study off

00:24:25.334 --> 00:24:26.690
PubMed, and read it.
 

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:29.688
And we have to be able to
ascertain the validity of the

00:24:29.688 --> 00:24:32.519
research that supports our
choices as clinicians.

00:24:32.519 --> 00:24:34.450
There's a lot of marketing out
there;

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.425
as we heard,
there's a lot of money to be

00:24:36.425 --> 00:24:37.759
made off these compounds.
 

00:24:37.759 --> 00:24:41.768
And I think I'm going to also
propose today that we as a

00:24:41.768 --> 00:24:43.567
society,
we as patients,

00:24:43.567 --> 00:24:47.505
we as members of the society,
perhaps a society who may one

00:24:47.505 --> 00:24:50.349
day have a single-payer
healthcare system,

00:24:50.349 --> 00:24:52.118
we need to be educated also.
 

00:24:52.118 --> 00:24:54.309
And this information's
available.

00:24:54.309 --> 00:24:55.348
It's available on the web.
 

00:24:55.348 --> 00:24:57.766
You've already seen some of it
from Professor McBride this

00:24:57.766 --> 00:24:58.190
morning.
 

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:00.568
This website is a fantastic
resource.

00:25:00.568 --> 00:25:02.588
If you have a question about
any medication you're taking,

00:25:02.588 --> 00:25:05.140
you want to look at the
chemical compound of it,

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.450
the chemical structure and how
they designed it,

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.608
how they make it,
how it's marketed,

00:25:10.608 --> 00:25:13.789
how it's distributed,
all this is available on the

00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:14.440
website.
 

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.465
So you can just plug in the
drug that you're taking,

00:25:16.465 --> 00:25:18.452
or the drug of interest,
and that information's all

00:25:18.452 --> 00:25:18.849
there.
 

00:25:18.849 --> 00:25:19.849
It's public domain.
 

00:25:19.849 --> 00:25:22.190
So use that as a resource.
 

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:26.868
But direct-to-patient marketing
can be really effective.

00:25:26.868 --> 00:25:30.538
And this is also referred to as
direct-to-consumer marketing.

00:25:30.538 --> 00:25:32.805
You saw some of it in the
earlier slides,

00:25:32.805 --> 00:25:35.636
but all you have to do is turn
on the evening news,

00:25:35.636 --> 00:25:37.618
and these ads are there,
right?

00:25:37.618 --> 00:25:40.632
Every time there's a commercial
break, you see some happy person

00:25:40.632 --> 00:25:42.640
walking around,
talking about this drug.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.480
And you just hear the drug name.
 

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.930
You don't hear anything more
about it.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:47.799
You may not hear anything about
the studies.

00:25:47.799 --> 00:25:50.930
But it can be very effective.
 

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.736
So I think we need to look
critically at some of the

00:25:53.736 --> 00:25:56.817
claims, and we need to think,
is this really actually the

00:25:56.817 --> 00:25:58.798
right thing for me to be taking?
 

00:25:58.798 --> 00:26:02.579
So my specialty -- so back to
our clinical model -- my

00:26:02.579 --> 00:26:04.720
specialty is otolaryngology.
 

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:08.599
I'm focusing on the larynx with
laryngopharangeal reflux.

00:26:08.599 --> 00:26:10.720
The larynx is the voice box.
 

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.630
It's where your vocal cords are.
 

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:14.220
It's what we use when we're
speaking.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:17.009
Ear, nose and throat is another
name for my specialty.

00:26:17.009 --> 00:26:19.868
But we're talking about
laryngopharangeal reflux,

00:26:19.868 --> 00:26:21.537
which is reflux,
acid reflux,

00:26:21.537 --> 00:26:23.980
that primarily affects the
voice box.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.460
It's under-diagnosed.
 

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.752
It's also a significant source
of morbidity and decreased

00:26:28.752 --> 00:26:31.644
quality of life --
hoarseness, feeling like you

00:26:31.644 --> 00:26:34.931
have a frog in your throat,
sore throat -- and it's

00:26:34.931 --> 00:26:38.808
frequently associated with other
forms of reflux disease,

00:26:38.808 --> 00:26:41.528
like GE reflux disease,
gastroesophageal reflux

00:26:41.528 --> 00:26:42.118
disease.
 

00:26:42.118 --> 00:26:44.519
So it's a significant public
health problem.

00:26:44.519 --> 00:26:48.892
And this is a very busy slide,
but just to point out some

00:26:48.892 --> 00:26:53.576
statistics: that up to 10% of
patients who present to the ENT

00:26:53.576 --> 00:26:55.660
practice,
for any reason,

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:59.359
may actually have symptoms or
findings related to LPR,

00:26:59.359 --> 00:27:00.750
laryngopharyngeal reflux.
 

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:04.090
It's also increasingly
recognized as a problem that can

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:06.690
be associated with non-allergic
asthma,

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:10.125
and a great number of these
patients also present with a

00:27:10.125 --> 00:27:12.500
history of acid reflux from
other --

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.588
where their symptoms are coming
from other sources,

00:27:16.588 --> 00:27:18.539
such as the esophagus,
for example.

00:27:18.539 --> 00:27:20.569
So reflux is a very big problem.
 

00:27:20.569 --> 00:27:22.180
I see a lot of patients.
 

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.520
It's estimated that up to 40%
of the adult population in this

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.788
country may have reflux;
and some studies say even more.

00:27:28.788 --> 00:27:31.009
So there's a lot of money to be
made.

00:27:31.009 --> 00:27:33.480
What is its treatment?
 

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.837
In the year 2008,
what we're doing is we're

00:27:35.837 --> 00:27:38.308
treating this with proton pump
inhibitors.

00:27:38.308 --> 00:27:41.569
But I have to also put in a
disclaimer that there was a

00:27:41.569 --> 00:27:44.089
recent meta-analysis,
within the last couple of

00:27:44.089 --> 00:27:46.058
years, looking critically at the
literature,

00:27:46.058 --> 00:27:48.680
and at a number of different
studies.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.423
It evaluated about ten
different studies,

00:27:50.423 --> 00:27:52.779
and there is also a significant
placebo effect here.

00:27:52.779 --> 00:27:56.085
So the jury's not completely
out, but there are plenty of

00:27:56.085 --> 00:27:59.390
studies, in my literature,
that support it to use for the

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:00.630
treatment of LPR.
 

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:02.220
I'm not going to go into all
that today.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:05.990
But the reality is that PPIs
are FDA approved.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.925
They're out there.
 

00:28:06.925 --> 00:28:08.019
They're easy to get.
 

00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:10.893
All you have to do practically
is ask your physician for a

00:28:10.893 --> 00:28:11.650
prescription.
 

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.578
So what are we trying to target?
 

00:28:13.578 --> 00:28:16.480
Here is a reasonably
good-looking larynx.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.990
So these are the vocal cords.
 

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:20.048
This is the anterior portion.
 

00:28:20.048 --> 00:28:22.691
This is the posterior portion,
back where your esophagus is,

00:28:22.691 --> 00:28:23.990
and there's left and right.
 

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:27.240
So this is what I see when I'm
looking with a scope.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.574
I pass it very carefully
through the nose and we get a

00:28:29.574 --> 00:28:30.940
very nice look at the larynx.
 

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:32.849
And this is a patient with
moderately severe

00:28:32.849 --> 00:28:34.048
laryngopharyngeal reflux.
 

00:28:34.048 --> 00:28:36.411
You can see that there's a lot
of swelling here,

00:28:36.411 --> 00:28:38.170
compared to these other
pictures.

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:41.068
This area back here is all
beefed up, and this area down

00:28:41.068 --> 00:28:42.808
here also looks quite reddened.
 

00:28:42.808 --> 00:28:45.402
So this is what we're treating
with these proton pump

00:28:45.402 --> 00:28:46.048
inhibitors.
 

00:28:46.048 --> 00:28:48.344
And we're hoping to take a
patient that looks like this,

00:28:48.344 --> 00:28:50.680
and turn their larynx into
something more that looks like

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.640
this normal larynx.
 

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.470
You can see the sharpened edges
here.

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:55.308
So data is out there.
 

00:28:55.308 --> 00:28:58.430
We can follow this clinically,
and that's usually what we do.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:02.287
So another reality,
when you're considering these

00:29:02.287 --> 00:29:06.625
drugs that are being developed,
as we're hearing about today,

00:29:06.625 --> 00:29:09.497
and being prescribed,
is that really only about one

00:29:09.497 --> 00:29:12.691
in a 1000 of these compounds
that enter preclinical testing

00:29:12.691 --> 00:29:15.059
will actually make it to human
testing,

00:29:15.059 --> 00:29:16.390
what we call clinical trials.
 

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:20.394
And out of these only about a
fifth may actually be deemed

00:29:20.394 --> 00:29:24.608
safe and effective enough by the
FDA to gain FDA approval.

00:29:24.608 --> 00:29:28.664
FDA approval is the Holy Grail
for a pharmaceutical company

00:29:28.664 --> 00:29:32.859
interested in developing drugs
and getting these drugs on the

00:29:32.859 --> 00:29:33.630
market.
 

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:36.029
Without FDA approval they can't
market the drug.

00:29:36.029 --> 00:29:39.250
Without FDA approval they can't
put out ads on the evening news.

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:43.196
So this is an example of one of
those documents that's available

00:29:43.196 --> 00:29:45.390
on the website that I showed
you.

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:48.222
And this is the approval letter
for Prilosec OTC,

00:29:48.222 --> 00:29:49.700
which came out in 2003.
 

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.118
It was written to Proctor and
Gamble by the FDA.

00:29:52.118 --> 00:29:54.880
And I just want to point out
this area down here.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:00.023
This is an approval letter for
this drug, given at this dose,

00:30:00.023 --> 00:30:02.339
used for this indication.
 

00:30:02.339 --> 00:30:03.538
So they're very, very specific.
 

00:30:03.538 --> 00:30:07.077
The drug companies can't --
they're not allowed to market

00:30:07.077 --> 00:30:09.098
its use for other indications.
 

00:30:09.098 --> 00:30:11.615
But this is really,
really important information

00:30:11.615 --> 00:30:14.503
for the company in order to be
able to put this out and

00:30:14.503 --> 00:30:17.500
actually start to see some
return on their investment for

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.160
research and development.
 

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.576
So again I just want to point
out, this is for omeprazole

00:30:22.576 --> 00:30:25.808
twenty mg, for the treatment of
frequent heartburn.

00:30:25.808 --> 00:30:29.318
Now here's some information
that -- you saw a different form

00:30:29.318 --> 00:30:30.390
of this earlier.
 

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:33.967
Esomeprazole also has approval
by the FDA for a number of

00:30:33.967 --> 00:30:37.223
different indications,
but also for the treatment of

00:30:37.223 --> 00:30:38.630
GE reflux disease.
 

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:42.539
And what I want to point out
here is that in the design of

00:30:42.539 --> 00:30:45.970
these clinical trials they look
very carefully,

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.116
strategically,
at how can we show that our

00:30:48.116 --> 00:30:50.160
drug is better than the
competitor's?

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.404
So clinical trials,
when they're designing these,

00:30:53.404 --> 00:30:56.376
are generally broken down into
three phrases:

00:30:56.376 --> 00:30:58.000
phase I, II and III.
 

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.942
We have phase IV,
which usually occurs after the

00:31:01.942 --> 00:31:05.298
FDA has given approval for a
compound.

00:31:05.298 --> 00:31:07.970
Phase I is used in healthy
volunteers.

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:09.500
The endpoint is really safety.
 

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.348
They want to know what are the
side-effects.

00:31:11.348 --> 00:31:13.640
Is this a drug that we can
actually give to the public?

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.910
And they also use a lot of
studies to determine metabolism

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:20.180
and excretion of the drug at
this point in development.

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.789
And these are usually smaller
studies, and they usually only

00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:25.180
need anywhere from twenty to 100
patients for these.

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.262
And then once they pass into
phase I -- oh sorry,

00:31:28.262 --> 00:31:31.088
let me say just a little bit
about safety.

00:31:31.088 --> 00:31:36.101
Some of the side-effects -- in
the industry they call these

00:31:36.101 --> 00:31:37.568
adverse events.
 

00:31:37.568 --> 00:31:39.800
This is a terminology that the
FDA uses as well,

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.460
and it really is just something
to mean a side-effect.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.434
Somebody had something that was
out of the ordinary and they

00:31:45.434 --> 00:31:47.098
happened to be taking the drug.
 

00:31:47.098 --> 00:31:49.442
So you have to at least
consider that it may have been

00:31:49.442 --> 00:31:52.048
considered by the -- it may have
been caused by the drug.

00:31:52.048 --> 00:31:55.086
A serious adverse event
would've led to some sort of

00:31:55.086 --> 00:31:57.825
damage to the patient,
or extended care such as

00:31:57.825 --> 00:31:59.788
hospitalization or a surgery.
 

00:31:59.788 --> 00:32:01.582
And these AEs,
adverse events,

00:32:01.582 --> 00:32:05.288
need to be reported to the FDA
during the clinical trials.

00:32:05.288 --> 00:32:07.644
So they're watched very
carefully, and they can't

00:32:07.644 --> 00:32:10.340
proceed through to the next
phase of clinical studies if

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.743
there are too many adverse
events or, for example,

00:32:12.743 --> 00:32:15.837
if they have deaths;
those usually tend to raise

00:32:15.837 --> 00:32:17.318
really big red flags.
 

00:32:17.318 --> 00:32:19.890
And again, all this
information's available on that

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:20.608
FDA website.
 

00:32:20.608 --> 00:32:23.372
So if you want to see how a
drug was developed and what

00:32:23.372 --> 00:32:25.726
adverse events occurred during
its development,

00:32:25.726 --> 00:32:28.078
you can see that there,
for the most part.

00:32:28.078 --> 00:32:30.548
There's a lot of internal stuff
that's not going to be on there,

00:32:30.548 --> 00:32:33.655
but for the most part they have
to report these AEs to the FDA

00:32:33.655 --> 00:32:34.930
as they're going along.
 

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:38.538
In phase II they're looking for
effectiveness or efficacy.

00:32:38.538 --> 00:32:42.174
The preliminary data generated
generally is for effectiveness

00:32:42.174 --> 00:32:45.690
of the compound for a particular
disease or a condition.

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:48.786
So this is where we start to
get into specifics about which

00:32:48.786 --> 00:32:52.095
dose of omeprazole am I going to
choose if I'm going to compare

00:32:52.095 --> 00:32:53.430
this to esomeprazole?
 

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:56.420
They can compare it also to
placebo.

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:58.328
They can compare it to a
different drug.

00:32:58.328 --> 00:33:00.221
And again they're looking at
adverse events,

00:33:00.221 --> 00:33:02.598
they're looking at safety,
but they're also starting to

00:33:02.598 --> 00:33:04.798
now look, am I actually
targeting the disease?

00:33:04.798 --> 00:33:06.509
The study sizes are usually
bigger.

00:33:06.509 --> 00:33:09.103
And then finally,
if it gets past phase II,

00:33:09.103 --> 00:33:10.769
you can get to phase III.
 

00:33:10.769 --> 00:33:13.451
And if anybody watches the
stock market,

00:33:13.451 --> 00:33:16.615
looking at drug companies or
biotech companies,

00:33:16.615 --> 00:33:20.192
phase III is where things
really -- you'll hear about

00:33:20.192 --> 00:33:20.950
this.
 

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:23.288
When Wall Street hears a
whisper that a drug's not going

00:33:23.288 --> 00:33:24.990
to make it through phase III
studies,

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:28.325
or it may not get FDA approval,
you can tank the price of the

00:33:28.325 --> 00:33:28.769
stock.
 

00:33:28.769 --> 00:33:31.660
It's really quite remarkable to
watch, as a clinician.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:35.869
Because again I don't really
have any vested interest in any

00:33:35.869 --> 00:33:39.446
particular company,
but I just find it fascinating

00:33:39.446 --> 00:33:43.061
that even just a suggestion will
actually impact things

00:33:43.061 --> 00:33:45.640
economically,
so importantly.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:48.473
So here again we continue to
look at safety and

00:33:48.473 --> 00:33:49.460
effectiveness.
 

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.338
We may study different patient
populations.

00:33:52.338 --> 00:33:55.058
They may look abroad to do some
of these studies.

00:33:55.058 --> 00:33:58.404
India is a place where a lot of
studies are being done these

00:33:58.404 --> 00:34:00.220
days - Eastern Europe as well.
 

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.823
They may look at different
dosages, and they may combine

00:34:02.823 --> 00:34:03.960
this with other drugs.
 

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.150
These are usually very large
studies.

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:08.880
By this time they've gotten to
-- they want to see clinical

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.563
differences that are so subtle
that they have to have very

00:34:11.563 --> 00:34:14.530
large numbers of patients to
make this statistically sound.

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:17.807
So they cost -- these studies
cost millions and millions of

00:34:17.807 --> 00:34:18.599
dollars too.
 

00:34:18.599 --> 00:34:20.460
So these companies are very,
very invested.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.324
They want to make sure that
they get return on their

00:34:22.324 --> 00:34:22.800
investment.
 

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:27.619
And then phase IV occurs after
the FDA has approved a drug.

00:34:27.619 --> 00:34:30.250
These are post-marketing study
commitments,

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:32.449
and these are commitments by
the sponsor,

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:35.483
the person actually doing the
studies and marketing the drug

00:34:35.483 --> 00:34:37.559
and selling it,
that they will provide

00:34:37.559 --> 00:34:40.750
additional information to the
FDA about the product safety,

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:43.090
efficacy or perhaps its optimal
use.

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:46.226
And more recently we're hearing
about phase zero trials in the

00:34:46.226 --> 00:34:49.369
cancer research literature --
my area of research is in

00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:52.088
cancer --
and phase zero trials are

00:34:52.088 --> 00:34:55.110
exploratory, first-in-human
trials.

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:58.262
So these are designed to speed
up development of promising

00:34:58.262 --> 00:34:58.760
agents.
 

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.836
As we know, cancer is a very
big problem in this country,

00:35:01.836 --> 00:35:04.969
especially with the population
aging, and it can kill very

00:35:04.969 --> 00:35:05.630
quickly.
 

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:09.081
So these trials are designed to
establish very early on whether

00:35:09.081 --> 00:35:12.255
an agent behaves in human
subjects differently than it was

00:35:12.255 --> 00:35:14.650
expected from the pre-clinical
studies.

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:15.900
And that does happen sometimes.
 

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.724
So you can imagine if you spent
months and months planning a

00:35:18.724 --> 00:35:20.443
phase I trial,
only to find out,

00:35:20.443 --> 00:35:23.420
when you put it into humans,
that it reacts -- it doesn't

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.579
behave the way you expected,
based on how it looked in mice,

00:35:26.579 --> 00:35:29.829
you can lose a lot of money and
you lose a lot of momentum.

00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:33.746
So these phase zero trials are
being put more and more into

00:35:33.746 --> 00:35:34.219
play.
 

00:35:34.219 --> 00:35:36.579
So back to our clinical model.
 

00:35:36.579 --> 00:35:39.336
So some of the studies that we
already heard about from

00:35:39.336 --> 00:35:42.094
Professor McBride were to
determine whether these drugs

00:35:42.094 --> 00:35:44.699
actually worked in patients with
reflux or not.

00:35:44.699 --> 00:35:48.050
So, and I'm not showing all the
studies, by the way.

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:49.389
I just have to disclose that.
 

00:35:49.389 --> 00:35:51.239
I'm only showing you a few
studies,

00:35:51.239 --> 00:35:54.525
just to demonstrate what type
of data I have to actually take

00:35:54.525 --> 00:35:56.452
into consideration,
as a clinician,

00:35:56.452 --> 00:35:59.250
when I'm looking critically at
how the studies were done;

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:02.045
whether I think the drug's
actually going to be helpful for

00:36:02.045 --> 00:36:03.010
my patient or not.
 

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:06.657
So this was in a group of
patients, a particular patient

00:36:06.657 --> 00:36:10.570
population, with already
established erosive esophagitis;

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:12.889
sounds pretty bad.
 

00:36:12.889 --> 00:36:14.079
It's pretty uncomfortable.
 

00:36:14.079 --> 00:36:17.123
They studied these patients
with esomeprazole and

00:36:17.123 --> 00:36:20.420
omeprazole, at similar doses,
with similar numbers of

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.070
patients in both arms.
 

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:25.650
They found no statistically
significant difference in the

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:28.527
symptoms of heartburn,
sustained resolution of

00:36:28.527 --> 00:36:31.659
heartburn symptoms in this group
of patients.

00:36:31.659 --> 00:36:35.380
Now if you read the
esomeprazole package insert,

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.226
they state that they chose
omeprazole twenty as the

00:36:38.226 --> 00:36:40.722
competitor dose,
because it's the FDA approved

00:36:40.722 --> 00:36:42.760
dose for this indication;
which it is.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.949
So then I went to the Prilosec
package insert to find that they

00:36:45.949 --> 00:36:48.880
did look at 40 mg when they were
looking at these types of

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:49.550
symptoms.
 

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:52.740
They found that there was
really no improve -- no benefit

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.280
to using the higher dose.
 

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:57.327
So they went with the lower
dose when they went for FDA

00:36:57.327 --> 00:36:57.949
approval.
 

00:36:57.949 --> 00:37:00.760
So that's, I think,
partly why they chose 20 mg.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.059
And then also,
if you look more closely,

00:37:03.059 --> 00:37:06.623
there's also they lose some
linearity between plasma

00:37:06.623 --> 00:37:09.840
concentration versus areas under
the curve,

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.610
which is plasma concentration
in the patient over time.

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:16.280
So it becomes less and less
predictable, as you go up on the

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.074
dose, how much drug is actually
being seen physiologically for

00:37:20.074 --> 00:37:21.070
the patient.
 

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:23.815
So once they get out of that
predictable linearity,

00:37:23.815 --> 00:37:26.947
things become a little bit
iffy, and you could potentially

00:37:26.947 --> 00:37:28.539
get into adverse effects.
 

00:37:28.539 --> 00:37:31.289
So I think that's part of the
logic for why they chose that.

00:37:31.289 --> 00:37:35.222
But again, I'm not trying to
make an exhaustive argument for

00:37:35.222 --> 00:37:38.690
what should've been done or
against what was done;

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:42.307
just to give you some idea for
what we have to deal with as

00:37:42.307 --> 00:37:43.119
clinicians.
 

00:37:43.119 --> 00:37:45.793
So then finally these are some
of the three studies that

00:37:45.793 --> 00:37:48.664
Professor McBride has already
alluded to, showing that there

00:37:48.664 --> 00:37:49.880
are variable results.
 

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.143
This one showed a definite
statistically significant

00:37:53.143 --> 00:37:56.213
improvement in healing of
erosive esophagitis for

00:37:56.213 --> 00:37:59.666
esomeprazole over --
any dose of esomeprazole over

00:37:59.666 --> 00:38:00.460
omeprazole.
 

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.538
But two other studies actually
showed that there was no

00:38:03.538 --> 00:38:04.280
difference.
 

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.751
So there's another bigger study
as well that's not included

00:38:07.751 --> 00:38:08.170
here.
 

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:10.590
Prof: Actually it's the
next one.

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:11.581
Dr. Dianne Duffey:
 Oh I'm sorry,

00:38:11.581 --> 00:38:12.268
yeah there it is,
okay.

00:38:12.268 --> 00:38:16.184
Yeah, so again you just kind of
have to look at the literature

00:38:16.184 --> 00:38:18.561
and say okay,
I'm convinced or I'm not

00:38:18.561 --> 00:38:19.460
convinced.
 

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.518
I don't know that there's any
right or wrong.

00:38:21.518 --> 00:38:23.579
But the FDA also has a role to
play here,

00:38:23.579 --> 00:38:27.550
and they really vet these
studies quite well,

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:29.677
and they're not allowed to
market if they don't feel that

00:38:29.677 --> 00:38:31.251
--
if the FDA doesn't feel that

00:38:31.251 --> 00:38:33.739
there's sufficient evidence
there to support it.

00:38:33.739 --> 00:38:37.519
So in my patient population,
who have LPR,

00:38:37.519 --> 00:38:42.130
a large number of these
patients have heartburn.

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:44.510
They may or may not be treated
for the heartburn already.

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:47.090
I may be the first physician
they see, and I may say,

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:49.820
"Well do you also have
heartburn symptoms?"

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:52.719
Those would be GE reflux type
of symptoms.

00:38:52.719 --> 00:38:56.599
So I can end up treating both
of those if I put my patient on

00:38:56.599 --> 00:38:59.768
one of these PPIs for
laryngopharyngeal reflux.

00:38:59.768 --> 00:39:03.028
So if I've just told you that
these drugs are approved for a

00:39:03.028 --> 00:39:05.800
specific indication,
maybe at a specific dose,

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.099
how is it I'm able to use it
for something that it's not

00:39:09.099 --> 00:39:10.780
really even approved for?
 

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:14.000
And this is where we get into
off-label use of drugs.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.269
So once a drug is approved by
the FDA for any indication,

00:39:17.269 --> 00:39:20.072
I as a clinician can write it,
as a prescription,

00:39:20.072 --> 00:39:21.650
for another indication.
 

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:24.989
But the FDA has put out these
guidelines,

00:39:24.989 --> 00:39:28.028
such that good medical practice
and the best interests of the

00:39:28.028 --> 00:39:31.260
patient should prevail here,
so that we're using legally

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:33.795
available drugs --
it's an important term --

00:39:33.795 --> 00:39:36.572
according to the --
and devices -- according to my

00:39:36.572 --> 00:39:39.039
best knowledge and judgment as a
clinician.

00:39:39.039 --> 00:39:41.782
If we use a product for an
indication that's not in the

00:39:41.782 --> 00:39:44.275
approved labeling,
I have the responsibility to be

00:39:44.275 --> 00:39:47.264
well-informed about the product,
to base its use on firm

00:39:47.264 --> 00:39:50.349
scientific rationale,
and on sound medical evidence.

00:39:50.349 --> 00:39:53.682
Now in my literature there's a
lot of sound medical evidence

00:39:53.682 --> 00:39:56.960
supporting the use for PPIs in
laryngopharyngeal reflux.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.371
But I just also --
Prof: Can I ask you a

00:39:58.371 --> 00:39:58.768
question about that?
 

00:39:58.768 --> 00:39:59.420
Dr. Dianne Duffey:
 Yeah.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.268
Prof: You say you have a
--

00:40:01.268 --> 00:40:04.125
it's not underlined there but
you say there's a responsibility

00:40:04.125 --> 00:40:06.699
to maintain records of the
product's use and effects.

00:40:06.699 --> 00:40:07.070
Dr. Dianne Duffey:
 Uh-hum.

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:09.686
Prof: Does anyone come
around and collect those records

00:40:09.686 --> 00:40:11.230
and try to make something of
them?

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:12.775
Dr. Dianne Duffey:
 I've never been contacted

00:40:12.775 --> 00:40:13.230
by anybody.
 

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:17.280
Prof: Are people pretty
conscientious about doing that?

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.898
Dr. Dianne Duffey:
 I think that we're

00:40:19.898 --> 00:40:22.876
conscientious about recording
whether there've been

00:40:22.876 --> 00:40:25.079
side-effects at the given dose.
 

00:40:25.079 --> 00:40:27.797
We're conscientious about
recording whether there's been

00:40:27.797 --> 00:40:29.280
improvement in the symptoms.
 

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.297
But I don't have a detailed
questionnaire,

00:40:32.297 --> 00:40:33.106
in general.
 

00:40:33.106 --> 00:40:34.688
So --
Prof: Yeah.

00:40:34.688 --> 00:40:37.550
Because one would think that
this would be sort of like a

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:39.534
wiki,
that even though you can't

00:40:39.534 --> 00:40:42.541
afford to do a big study,
that if you collect enough

00:40:42.541 --> 00:40:46.056
observations from enough people,
you could make something out of

00:40:46.056 --> 00:40:46.268
it.
 

00:40:46.268 --> 00:40:47.750
Dr. Dianne Duffey:
 We could,

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:48.300
we could.
 

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.070
But then you're in to
experimenting,

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:53.052
if you're doing it with the
intention of actually showing or

00:40:53.052 --> 00:40:54.469
disproving a hypothesis.
 

00:40:54.469 --> 00:40:56.385
Prof: Well but you said
you have a responsibility to

00:40:56.385 --> 00:40:57.079
maintain the records.
 

00:40:57.079 --> 00:40:57.210
Why?
 

00:40:57.210 --> 00:40:58.070
&gt;
 

00:40:58.070 --> 00:40:59.048
Dr. Dianne Duffey:
 We do.

00:40:59.048 --> 00:40:59.722
No, I agree with that.
 

00:40:59.722 --> 00:41:00.119
I agree.
 

00:41:00.119 --> 00:41:03.980
But we're not really obligated
to submit it to an IRB.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.771
If we were doing it with the
intention of definitely showing

00:41:06.771 --> 00:41:09.657
a difference one way or another,
then that would be considered

00:41:09.657 --> 00:41:10.510
an experiment.
 

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:13.431
So I would be obligated to run
that through the institutional

00:41:13.431 --> 00:41:15.193
review board,
which is there for the

00:41:15.193 --> 00:41:18.030
protection of human subjects,
and to make sure that any

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:20.699
studies that we're designing are
legitimate,

00:41:20.699 --> 00:41:23.675
that they're ethical,
that the patient has been given

00:41:23.675 --> 00:41:25.679
the opportunity to ask
questions.

00:41:25.679 --> 00:41:28.449
They can refuse,
they can drop out of the study.

00:41:28.449 --> 00:41:31.719
So, but they're all important
issues that I think would be in

00:41:31.719 --> 00:41:33.190
the realm of,
at that point,

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:34.989
doing actual experimentation.
 

00:41:34.989 --> 00:41:38.340
But it's a really important --
it's an important point.

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:41.820
But we can use these drugs for
off-label marketed uses.

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.717
Now the drug companies
importantly are not allowed to

00:41:44.717 --> 00:41:46.550
market;
they're not allowed to

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:49.150
advertise for off-label uses of
compounds.

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:53.250
So again I have a duty,
as a physician,

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:56.713
to evaluate this literature
critically and to really be able

00:41:56.713 --> 00:42:00.059
to validate or ascertain the
validity of the research that

00:42:00.059 --> 00:42:01.469
supports my choices.
 

00:42:01.469 --> 00:42:03.500
So just a very quick word about
marketing.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.572
As I mentioned,
my research area is in

00:42:05.572 --> 00:42:06.190
oncology.
 

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:09.052
I've been involved in some
clinical trials with oncologic

00:42:09.052 --> 00:42:10.739
drugs for head and neck cancer.
 

00:42:10.739 --> 00:42:13.170
And I get these emails all the
time.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:16.257
Marketing is a really big deal
when it comes to these

00:42:16.257 --> 00:42:16.969
compounds.
 

00:42:16.969 --> 00:42:21.800
Just to give you an idea,
this one in particular is about

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:25.510
how do you market your oncology
products?

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:28.960
And this is an actual meeting,
to which I was invited.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.992
And one of the teasers here is
that "in such a crowded and

00:42:31.992 --> 00:42:34.630
competitive market,
the ability to differentiate

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:37.420
your product has never been more
important."

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:40.836
So this just gives you some
idea of what the thought process

00:42:40.836 --> 00:42:42.980
is and what the general culture
is.

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:46.206
And this is again a wordy
slide, but just to point out --

00:42:46.206 --> 00:42:48.570
and this comes from Nature
News;

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:51.402
it's fairly recent -- that
industry is really starting

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:53.380
shift attention now to other
areas.

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:57.195
So cardiovascular drugs,
which cardiovascular disease is

00:42:57.195 --> 00:43:01.010
really the foremost killer in
our country right now,

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:04.114
but they're really shifting
their attention now to drugs

00:43:04.114 --> 00:43:07.219
where perhaps they can make
another blockbuster drug;

00:43:07.219 --> 00:43:09.701
and that's usually always what
the impetus is,

00:43:09.701 --> 00:43:10.969
return on investment.
 

00:43:10.969 --> 00:43:14.126
So oncology drugs;
immunology, which would be

00:43:14.126 --> 00:43:17.099
something for rheumatoid
arthritis, for example;

00:43:17.099 --> 00:43:20.581
and neurology are going to be a
very, very big focus of

00:43:20.581 --> 00:43:22.579
attention of pharma industry.
 

00:43:22.579 --> 00:43:25.527
So as you watch the evening
news, or whichever channel you

00:43:25.527 --> 00:43:28.286
might be tuning into,
you'll be hearing a lot more

00:43:28.286 --> 00:43:30.693
about this,
and I think a lot more direct

00:43:30.693 --> 00:43:33.340
to patient marketing is going to
take place.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:36.920
So again, this has been a lot
of fun for me to participate,

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:40.382
and I thank Professor McBride
also for stimulating me to think

00:43:40.382 --> 00:43:43.902
a little bit more deeply about
proton pump inhibitors and how I

00:43:43.902 --> 00:43:44.639
use them.
 

00:43:44.639 --> 00:43:46.650
Prof: Great. Thank you.
 

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:49.469
&gt;
 

00:43:49.469 --> 00:43:52.030
Prof: Leave it on,
there might be some questions.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:55.010
Are there some questions for
Dr. Duffey?

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:56.514
Dr. Dianne Duffey:
 I'd be happy to try to

00:43:56.514 --> 00:43:57.954
field any questions,
as long as they're not too

00:43:57.954 --> 00:43:58.300
hard.
 

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.429
Yeah?
 

00:44:01.429 --> 00:44:04.170
Student:  I am an
international student,

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:08.190
and I have noticed in the
marketing for drugs that they

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:12.510
have on television here that
they always give the full,

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:15.507
like two paragraphs about the
side-effects of the drugs,

00:44:15.507 --> 00:44:16.380
on television.
 

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:18.210
Is that required, and why?
 

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:20.050
How is that regulated?
 

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:22.315
Prof: Right,
so the question is from -- you

00:44:22.315 --> 00:44:24.119
said you're an international
student?

00:44:24.119 --> 00:44:24.880
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:24.920
Prof: She's from
Australia.

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.190
Student:  I'm not used
to that at all.

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:27.000
So it's sort of like whoa.
 

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.567
Dr. Dianne Duffey:
 Right.

00:44:28.567 --> 00:44:31.456
So she's noted when these ads
come on TV that there's a very

00:44:31.456 --> 00:44:34.199
long disclaimer afterwards about
the side-effects.

00:44:34.199 --> 00:44:37.802
And I'm not actually an expert
on how the marketing of these

00:44:37.802 --> 00:44:38.780
drugs is done.
 

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:41.998
I'm going to speculate here,
but I'm pretty confident that

00:44:41.998 --> 00:44:44.650
this is correct,
that the FDA mandates that they

00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:45.949
put that out there.
 

00:44:45.949 --> 00:44:49.338
So if you're going to make a
claim about a compound and how

00:44:49.338 --> 00:44:52.494
great it is, you also better
tell the other side of the

00:44:52.494 --> 00:44:53.079
story.
 

00:44:53.079 --> 00:44:54.371
You better tell them,
"Listen,

00:44:54.371 --> 00:44:56.157
we might fix your reflux but
you're going to get

00:44:56.157 --> 00:44:56.880
diarrhea."
 

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:57.300
You know?
 

00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.829
And it's kind of funny
actually, because if you look at

00:44:59.829 --> 00:45:02.206
these and you say,
"Okay, I'm going to take

00:45:02.206 --> 00:45:05.034
that drug to fix my runny nose,
but I'm going to get diarrhea

00:45:05.034 --> 00:45:07.309
and muscle pains and all these
other things."

00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:11.961
So it really -- I think it's
probably mandated by the FDA,

00:45:11.961 --> 00:45:16.369
and the FCC also may have
something to do with that.

00:45:16.369 --> 00:45:20.300
But that would be my
speculation.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.409
Yes?
 

00:45:21.409 --> 00:45:24.010
Prof: Sam?
 

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:27.168
Student:  I was
wondering what your opinion is

00:45:27.168 --> 00:45:30.753
about -- I know recently one of
the big things was like that

00:45:30.753 --> 00:45:32.030
Vioxx isn't safe.
 

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:35.353
Do you think that clinical
trials, they should do longer

00:45:35.353 --> 00:45:36.260
term studies?
 

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:39.695
Because I think -- I don't know
of other specific examples,

00:45:39.695 --> 00:45:43.132
but a lot of drugs like it
comes through after a long time,

00:45:43.132 --> 00:45:45.762
long-term use problems --
Dr. Dianne Duffey:

00:45:45.762 --> 00:45:47.509
 Right, and then we wonder
as consumers,

00:45:47.509 --> 00:45:48.239
is this safe?
 

00:45:48.239 --> 00:45:51.079
If I'm going to keep taking
this drug for years and years,

00:45:51.079 --> 00:45:53.469
am I safe, or are my progeny
going to be safe?

00:45:53.469 --> 00:45:54.530
It's a good question.
 

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:57.197
And that's where some of these
phase IV studies -- they're

00:45:57.197 --> 00:45:59.210
called post-marketing studies --
come in.

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:02.481
I was involved with one
clinical trial where a phase IV

00:46:02.481 --> 00:46:04.300
study actually was mandated.
 

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:07.489
And so for years afterwards
that drug company had to

00:46:07.489 --> 00:46:11.115
continue to pour resources into
contacting patients who had

00:46:11.115 --> 00:46:13.690
taken the drug --
"Are you still taking it?

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:15.567
If you're still taking it,
what side-effects are you

00:46:15.567 --> 00:46:16.119
having?"
 

00:46:16.119 --> 00:46:19.179
So those are mandated on some
level.

00:46:19.179 --> 00:46:21.829
And the FDA really plays the
key role there.

00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:25.940
And that's been my experience.
 

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:27.639
But it definitely raises
questions.

00:46:27.639 --> 00:46:30.940
And the Vioxx trial just was
devastating for Merck.

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:33.780
And I think a lot -- they
didn't see a lot of that coming.

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:36.949
So I think for the pharma
companies -- correct me if I'm

00:46:36.949 --> 00:46:38.688
wrong;
you may have more insights --

00:46:38.688 --> 00:46:40.630
it's probably,
it's a decision that they have

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:41.159
to weigh.
 

00:46:41.159 --> 00:46:44.630
How much resources are they
going to continue to pour in?

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:46.833
And that would,
on paper, it would take away

00:46:46.833 --> 00:46:47.909
from their profits.
 

00:46:47.909 --> 00:46:52.059
So I'm sure there's a lot of
internal debate about it.

00:46:52.059 --> 00:46:55.936
But yeah, that's where we're
thankful that we have the FDA

00:46:55.936 --> 00:46:56.889
looking out.
 

00:46:56.889 --> 00:47:00.099
A lot of countries don't have
an organization such as the FDA.

00:47:00.099 --> 00:47:03.315
You can market anything you
want, for almost any indication,

00:47:03.315 --> 00:47:04.679
and whatever dose goes.
 

00:47:04.679 --> 00:47:07.789
So I think we're very fortunate
in that respect.

00:47:07.789 --> 00:47:10.139
I'm going to turn the mike over.
 

00:47:10.139 --> 00:47:11.257
Prof: Well Dana's got a
question.

00:47:11.257 --> 00:47:12.260
Dr. Dianne Duffey:
 Oh sorry,

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:12.719
I'm sorry.
 

00:47:12.719 --> 00:47:15.168
Student:  I've heard
there can be cases where a drug

00:47:15.168 --> 00:47:17.829
was actually more effective for
a certain off-label use than the

00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:19.730
use that it's actually FDA
approved for,

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:23.186
but it's been FDA approved for
something that has a bigger

00:47:23.186 --> 00:47:25.793
patient population,
so you can potentially make

00:47:25.793 --> 00:47:26.360
more money.
 

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.152
If off-label uses can't be
advertised, how do you as

00:47:29.152 --> 00:47:31.780
doctors find out about that and
evaluate that?

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:34.940
Dr. Dianne Duffey:
 So the question is if an

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:38.668
off-label use for a drug can't
be advertised by the company,

00:47:38.668 --> 00:47:41.449
how do I as a physician hear
about it?

00:47:41.449 --> 00:47:45.396
I would hear about it from
other clinical trials that were

00:47:45.396 --> 00:47:49.619
done, maybe have -- may have
been supported by the company;

00:47:49.619 --> 00:47:53.199
so as we saw an example of
earlier.

00:47:53.199 --> 00:47:56.179
But I look for literature
within my field.

00:47:56.179 --> 00:47:59.170
So laryngopharyngeal reflux is
a perfect example of that.

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:01.619
It works pretty well,
for this drug,

00:48:01.619 --> 00:48:03.369
but you do have to take it for
a longer time period,

00:48:03.369 --> 00:48:06.248
and sometimes you actually have
to take it for higher doses than

00:48:06.248 --> 00:48:07.940
is recommended for GE reflux
alone.

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:10.938
But it works pretty well,
and I hear patients all the

00:48:10.938 --> 00:48:12.380
time say that it works.
 

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:14.780
I have other patients who say
it doesn't work.

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:19.840
So yeah, we just have to look
at our own literature.

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.233
And there are smaller studies;
they may have fifty,

00:48:22.233 --> 00:48:23.280
seventy patients.
 

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:27.300
But in an academic institution,
somebody who,

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.130
with an interest in that
particular area,

00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:31.242
may run their own study,
because they want that

00:48:31.242 --> 00:48:33.539
information and the
information's not out there.

00:48:33.539 --> 00:48:38.349
So we look for good solid data
to help guide our choices that

00:48:38.349 --> 00:48:38.829
way.
 

00:48:41.969 --> 00:48:42.539
Prof: Kevin?
 

00:48:42.539 --> 00:48:45.909
Student:  As a
physician, about off-label use,

00:48:45.909 --> 00:48:51.001
do you ever use drugs in an
off-label use and take advantage

00:48:51.001 --> 00:48:55.110
of their side-effects,
in that sense?

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:56.914
Dr. Dianne Duffey:
 Okay.

00:48:56.914 --> 00:48:59.300
I'll give you -- well yeah
there was.

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:02.686
So when -- I don't,
I don't really have any drugs

00:49:02.686 --> 00:49:04.239
that I use that for.
 

00:49:04.239 --> 00:49:08.929
But there's one drug in my
field;

00:49:08.929 --> 00:49:10.659
Botox, for example.
 

00:49:10.659 --> 00:49:16.980
Botox was being used to help
weaken the vocal cords.

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:18.239
Okay?
 

00:49:18.239 --> 00:49:21.467
It's been used for that for
years, in patients who have

00:49:21.467 --> 00:49:24.994
speech problems and don't have
good control over their vocal

00:49:24.994 --> 00:49:26.610
cords and the function.
 

00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:28.659
So you can use Botox injections.
 

00:49:28.659 --> 00:49:31.976
Then Botox injections came
along for use in the face,

00:49:31.976 --> 00:49:35.038
and you read about this on page
six all the time;

00:49:35.038 --> 00:49:36.250
it's hilarious.
 

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:41.842
But what they've also noticed
was that migraine headaches got

00:49:41.842 --> 00:49:43.239
a lot better.
 

00:49:43.239 --> 00:49:46.137
So you can use that,
you can use Botox to treat

00:49:46.137 --> 00:49:47.460
migraine headaches.
 

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:51.108
And there actually are phase
III trials going on right now by

00:49:51.108 --> 00:49:54.514
a colleague of mine down in
Manhattan, looking at exactly

00:49:54.514 --> 00:49:55.610
that question.
 

00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:59.255
So yeah, you can use them for
-- and you can take advantage of

00:49:59.255 --> 00:50:00.989
some of these side-effects.
 

00:50:00.989 --> 00:50:04.797
But I don't know of any
specific negative side-effects

00:50:04.797 --> 00:50:06.018
that were used.
 

00:50:06.018 --> 00:50:07.117
But that just happened.
 

00:50:07.117 --> 00:50:09.840
You may see some beneficial
positive side-effects that the

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.989
pharma companies didn't even
know existed;

00:50:11.989 --> 00:50:13.239
they didn't even target that.
 

00:50:13.239 --> 00:50:16.297
So we continue -- so that's
where it's important to do

00:50:16.297 --> 00:50:18.260
clinical trials,
as a clinician.

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:20.018
So I'm involved in clinical
trials as well.

00:50:20.018 --> 00:50:22.630
And that's sort of an ongoing
duty I think,

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:26.050
certainly being an academic
institution, that we need to

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:28.039
also play an important role.
 

00:50:28.039 --> 00:50:30.539
Okay? Thanks.
 

00:50:30.539 --> 00:50:32.625
Prof: So if you have a
few more questions,

00:50:32.625 --> 00:50:33.190
come on up.
 

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.579
Dr. Dianne Duffey:
 Yeah.

00:50:33.579 --> 00:50:35.699
Prof: I'm sure you have
to get back to your practice.

00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:38.340
But the time's up now,
and thanks again Dr. Duffey.

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:38.894
Dr. Dianne Duffey:
 My pleasure.

00:50:38.894 --> 00:50:39.099
Thank you.
 

00:50:39.099 --> 00:50:41.800

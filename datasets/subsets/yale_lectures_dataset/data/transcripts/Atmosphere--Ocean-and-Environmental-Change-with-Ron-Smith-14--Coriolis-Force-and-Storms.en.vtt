00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.967
RONALD SMITH: Well, we're getting into weather,

00:00:02.967 --> 00:00:06.667
and so I'm going to be paying a
bit more attention to what's

00:00:06.667 --> 00:00:09.333
going on around us.

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:12.367
And this the--

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:17.167
a weather map from the
00Z soundings.

00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:18.467
In other words, the
soundings--

00:00:18.467 --> 00:00:22.167
the balloons that were launched
yesterday evening at

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:29.100
8:00 PM here would be
00Z Greenwich time.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.433
And each of these little
clusters of data represents a

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:34.900
balloon that was launched.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.300
And this is the 500 millibar
map, so when data is analyzed

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.700
above the Earth's surface, it's
normally done on constant

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.500
pressure surfaces.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.900
It's not exactly constant
altitude, but it's more or

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.133
less a flat, horizontal
surface.

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:57.400
And what's contoured in
black is actually

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.100
the altitude itself.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.600
So that constant pressure
surface is

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.700
a little bit rolling.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.133
But the thing to understand is
that the level of constant

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:14.967
altitude on a pressure surface
is very much analogous to an

00:01:14.967 --> 00:01:18.900
isobaric curve on
a level surface.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.000
So you can think of
these as isobars,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.767
these heavy black lines.

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:25.833
The temperture-- lines of
constant temperature, the

00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:31.067
isotherms, are in the
dashed blue lines.

00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:34.067
But the data from which
it is all derived are

00:01:34.067 --> 00:01:35.067
these little clusters.

00:01:35.067 --> 00:01:37.000
So there is the--

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.700
to the right of the symbol is
the altitude of the 500

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.967
millibar surface with
one zero left off.

00:01:45.967 --> 00:01:51.100
So at that station, the 500
millibar surface is 5,870

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.100
meters above sea level.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.733
The temperature is 27
Celsius, and the dew

00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:02.433
point is minus 11 Celsius.

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:06.400
So each of those balloons, as
they cross that surface, you

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.200
have the data there.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.267
And then the contours are
laid on by the computer.

00:02:10.267 --> 00:02:14.400
The winds are given too in a
little wind barb using the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.767
convention of a short feather
being five knots, a long

00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:23.500
feather being 10 knots, and
a thick feather like

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.433
that being 50 knots.

00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:28.400
So we're talking about
geostrophic balance.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.500
And I showed you a diagram like
this last time, but I

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.633
wanted to bring it up
to date by showing

00:02:32.633 --> 00:02:34.133
you the current one.

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:38.067
So this is the soundings
again from last night.

00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:41.767
It shows this rather interesting
little circular

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:44.600
pattern over the East Coast.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.267
And if you look at
these values--

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:51.733
560, 550, I guess, 549--

00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:54.467
so this is a low-pressure
center, so this would be

00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:56.533
called a cyclone.

00:02:56.533 --> 00:02:58.567
It's not at the Earth's
surface, necessarily.

00:02:58.567 --> 00:03:02.167
It's about five kilometers
up in the atmosphere.

00:03:02.167 --> 00:03:03.333
But that would be a cyclone.

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:07.500
So higher pressure around it,
lower pressure in the center.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.033
And just like we derived
theoretically, the winds go

00:03:13.033 --> 00:03:15.367
counterclockwise around that
because we're in the Northern

00:03:15.367 --> 00:03:16.100
Hemisphere.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.367
And notice how well the winds
parallel the isobars.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:26.333
And so these conclusions have
followed from the geostrophic

00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:29.167
balance assumption.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:33.867
And the closer the isobars are
together, the stronger the

00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:35.300
wind will be.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.700
Here's another system over the
West Coast, a strong jet

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.067
stream coming up here.

00:03:39.067 --> 00:03:42.967
Winds reaching to about 65 knots
where the isobars are

00:03:42.967 --> 00:03:45.700
closer together, and then where
the isobars are further

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.233
apart, the winds are
considerably weaker.

00:03:48.233 --> 00:03:54.733
So those general rules about
geostrophic balance are seen

00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:57.467
to hold on this kind
of a diagram.

00:03:57.467 --> 00:04:01.667
Are there any questions on this
one before I go back to

00:04:01.667 --> 00:04:02.933
the main lecture?

00:04:05.867 --> 00:04:09.133
So these maps are easy to find,
and I encourage you to

00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:12.800
check in with them from time to
time see what's going on.

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:23.300
Let me just get rid of this and
go back to where we were.

00:04:29.733 --> 00:04:31.333
Yeah, let me just go
back for a second.

00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:34.633
So we're in the geostrophic
discussion.

00:04:34.633 --> 00:04:39.367
I showed you these little
bullet points about

00:04:39.367 --> 00:04:42.267
geostrophic force balance.

00:04:42.267 --> 00:04:44.867
These formulas, we
went through.

00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:47.033
This is the map that I showed
you last Friday.

00:04:47.033 --> 00:04:50.367
This was from that moment.

00:04:50.367 --> 00:04:51.933
And of course, things
have changed a bit

00:04:51.933 --> 00:04:54.100
between now and then.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.000
It may be that that same trough
is the one that's slid

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.733
east and become a cut-off
cyclone the way we saw, or

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:03.133
maybe some other thing happened

00:05:03.133 --> 00:05:04.233
between the two dates.

00:05:04.233 --> 00:05:08.567
But I suspect it's just that
that slid over to the east and

00:05:08.567 --> 00:05:13.833
filled out to form a full, round
cyclone the way we saw.

00:05:13.833 --> 00:05:18.733
I think I ended with this one,
which was just an example of

00:05:18.733 --> 00:05:23.433
an isobaric map at the
surface of the Earth.

00:05:23.433 --> 00:05:26.000
These values are sea-level
pressure, so wherever the

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.633
pressure was measured, it was
reduced to a common altitude,

00:05:30.633 --> 00:05:33.367
sea level, and then the contours
were laid on it.

00:05:33.367 --> 00:05:36.500
So you can use this
to analyze then.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.867
And here we had an anticyclone
and a cyclone.

00:05:39.867 --> 00:05:43.233
There are no winds given on
this, but now, knowing the

00:05:43.233 --> 00:05:46.600
geostrophic law, we can say
quite a bit about this.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.533
The only problem is that this
is down close to the surface

00:05:49.533 --> 00:05:52.167
of the Earth, and in some cases
even below the surface

00:05:52.167 --> 00:05:52.667
of the Earth.

00:05:52.667 --> 00:05:54.200
This is kind of a fictitious--

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.067
there's no--

00:05:56.067 --> 00:05:58.067
these mountains are a kilometer
or two above sea

00:05:58.067 --> 00:06:01.767
level, so producing a sea-level
map is a little bit

00:06:01.767 --> 00:06:04.033
odd for that.

00:06:04.033 --> 00:06:05.267
But that's OK.

00:06:05.267 --> 00:06:06.433
We can still interpret it.

00:06:06.433 --> 00:06:08.733
But the other problem is that
when you're right down near

00:06:08.733 --> 00:06:12.267
the surface of the Earth, there
is some friction added

00:06:12.267 --> 00:06:16.667
to the winds as well, and that
will break the geostrophic

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:20.133
constraint maybe not too badly,
but it'll break it a

00:06:20.133 --> 00:06:20.933
little bit.

00:06:20.933 --> 00:06:25.800
What tends to happen when you're
near the surface is

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.067
that the winds, instead of
blowing right along the

00:06:28.067 --> 00:06:31.733
isobars, tend to rotate
in a little bit.

00:06:31.733 --> 00:06:34.900
So they're mostly going along
the isobars, but they're

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.667
crossing it a little bit from
high pressure to low.

00:06:38.667 --> 00:06:40.933
So the winds tend to rotate
a little bit like that.

00:06:43.467 --> 00:06:45.433
That subject is called
the Ekman layer.

00:06:45.433 --> 00:06:48.300
The Ekman layer is a description
of how those winds

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.300
turn in the boundary layer.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.367
And when you're analyzing
your pilot

00:06:53.367 --> 00:06:54.600
balloon data in the lab--

00:06:56.567 --> 00:07:01.033
in lab number two, you might
find some hint of that, some

00:07:01.033 --> 00:07:05.167
rotation of the wind in the
boundary layer due to that

00:07:05.167 --> 00:07:09.567
breaking of the geostrophic
law due to friction.

00:07:09.567 --> 00:07:11.500
So keep-- you may not see it or
you may see it, but keep an

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:17.267
eye open for it in that data
that you're analyzing from the

00:07:17.267 --> 00:07:20.200
pilot balloon launch.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.567
So what more can I say?

00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:23.767
Well, we're going to be talking
about mid-latitude

00:07:23.767 --> 00:07:28.433
cyclones probably next time, and
this is an example where

00:07:28.433 --> 00:07:31.733
in addition to sketching in
the isobars, they've also

00:07:31.733 --> 00:07:34.833
drawn in their interpretation
of where the cold fronts and

00:07:34.833 --> 00:07:37.133
the warm fronts are on
this particular day.

00:07:37.133 --> 00:07:38.867
But that's more of an
interpretive thing.

00:07:38.867 --> 00:07:41.033
The isobars are just
cut and dry.

00:07:41.033 --> 00:07:46.633
If you know the pressure data,
you can contour those in.

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:49.167
If you expand out to look
at most of the Northern

00:07:49.167 --> 00:07:55.467
Hemisphere, you can see that at
any given time, there are

00:07:55.467 --> 00:08:00.933
lots of highs and lows, cyclones
and anticyclones.

00:08:00.933 --> 00:08:04.067
And again, no wind is given on
this, but you can get a pretty

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:06.033
good idea of what the wind is.

00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:08.633
Each one of these lows has the
wind going around this way.

00:08:08.633 --> 00:08:12.300
Each one of the highs has the
wind going around that way.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.867
And the speed of the wind
is related to the

00:08:14.867 --> 00:08:18.867
packing of the isobars.

00:08:18.867 --> 00:08:22.700
So the mid-latitude and
high-latitude atmosphere is

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.567
just loaded with these eddies.

00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:32.600
And one of their jobs is to pump
heat northward to balance

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.933
the heat budget of the high
latitudes and low latitudes,

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:40.267
which I spoke about last time.

00:08:40.267 --> 00:08:41.733
If you go to the Southern
Hemisphere-- here's

00:08:41.733 --> 00:08:42.300
Australia--

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.700
of course, now everything is
backwards, because the

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.433
Coriolis force is reversed in
the Southern Hemisphere.

00:08:49.433 --> 00:08:52.900
It acts to the left of
the motion vector.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.633
And so those relationships that
we derived have to be

00:08:55.633 --> 00:08:56.733
reversed also.

00:08:56.733 --> 00:09:00.067
So here is a low-pressure
center.

00:09:00.067 --> 00:09:02.667
We would call it a cyclone.

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:06.867
And the sea-level pressure is
given there, 968 millibars,

00:09:06.867 --> 00:09:09.567
976, getting higher
as you go away.

00:09:09.567 --> 00:09:12.733
And they've indicated the arrow
here indicating the

00:09:12.733 --> 00:09:17.567
direction of circulation, and
indeed, it is clockwise.

00:09:17.567 --> 00:09:22.100
So the circulation around this
cyclone is opposite to what it

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.533
would be if we were in the
Northern Hemisphere, because

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:29.367
the-- well, the Coriolis force
has a reversed sign.

00:09:33.233 --> 00:09:37.633
And again, if you look at a
larger map with the Southern

00:09:37.633 --> 00:09:42.067
Hemisphere, here's Antarctica,
Australia, Cape Horn, Cape of

00:09:42.067 --> 00:09:46.600
Good Hope, filled with
highs and lows.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.300
And again, all the circulations
are the opposite

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.533
to what they would be in the
Northern Hemisphere.

00:09:57.233 --> 00:09:58.533
So a few things.

00:09:58.533 --> 00:10:02.933
To finish up the discussion, I
wanted to mention these four

00:10:02.933 --> 00:10:06.933
items and also see if you
have any questions.

00:10:06.933 --> 00:10:10.200
So try to think up some
questions before we finish

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.033
this subject.

00:10:11.033 --> 00:10:13.833
First of all, geostrophic
adjustment.

00:10:13.833 --> 00:10:19.467
It's fine to claim that the
Earth's atmosphere is in

00:10:19.467 --> 00:10:21.667
geostrophic balance
most of the time.

00:10:21.667 --> 00:10:24.767
But I think an even more
fundamental question is how

00:10:24.767 --> 00:10:28.600
does it come to be in
geostrophic balance?

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.900
And that process is called
geostrophic adjustment.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.767
And one way to imagine it--

00:10:35.767 --> 00:10:38.667
but you can do these
calculations on your own-- is

00:10:38.667 --> 00:10:41.800
to imagine you've got some
isobars drawn on a map.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.400
In this case, they've been drawn
east-west, and they've

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.733
been labeled with pressure.

00:10:48.733 --> 00:10:51.333
And let's assume at the
beginning moment that you've

00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:56.167
got a parcel of air sitting
there not moving.

00:10:56.167 --> 00:10:59.633
Well, you know that's not in
geostrophic balance, because

00:10:59.633 --> 00:11:02.467
it's in a region that has
a pressure gradient.

00:11:02.467 --> 00:11:05.233
So it's going to have a pressure
gradient force.

00:11:05.233 --> 00:11:09.033
But if it's not moving, it can't
have a Coriolis force,

00:11:09.033 --> 00:11:11.600
so those two forces cannot
possibly be in balance.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.133
So here's your parcel
not moving.

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:19.200
I release it, and it's going
to immediately feel the

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.400
pressure gradient force pushing
it towards the north.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.133
It's going to start to
accelerate in that direction.

00:11:26.133 --> 00:11:30.100
So as the minutes and hours tick
by, starting with zero

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.267
speed, it's going to have then
maybe one meter per second,

00:11:33.267 --> 00:11:35.700
two meters per second, three
meters per second.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.967
But now, as it picks up speed,
it's going to start to feel a

00:11:39.967 --> 00:11:43.200
Coriolis force, small at first,
because remember, the

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.433
Coriolis force is proportional
to the wind speed.

00:11:47.433 --> 00:11:51.333
So after some time, it may have
moved to here, and it

00:11:51.333 --> 00:11:53.967
will have developed a little
bit of Coriolis force, and

00:11:53.967 --> 00:11:55.267
it'll start to turn.

00:11:55.267 --> 00:11:58.333
The Coriolis force is
a deflecting force.

00:11:58.333 --> 00:11:59.467
It'll start to turn.

00:11:59.467 --> 00:12:02.233
Throughout all this time,
however, because I've drawn

00:12:02.233 --> 00:12:06.233
these isobars equally spaced,
the pressure gradient force on

00:12:06.233 --> 00:12:08.633
that parcel will remain
the same.

00:12:08.633 --> 00:12:12.100
So it's always being pushed to
the north by the pressure

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.967
gradient force, but as it moves
and accelerates, it

00:12:15.967 --> 00:12:20.733
turns and accelerates and
eventually ends up moving east

00:12:20.733 --> 00:12:25.967
with a speed that will give it
an equal and opposite Coriolis

00:12:25.967 --> 00:12:27.233
force and pressure gradient.

00:12:27.233 --> 00:12:31.667
So that will-- that process of
geostrophic adjustment usually

00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:35.767
takes about 12 hours
in the atmosphere.

00:12:35.767 --> 00:12:38.867
Parcels could be disturbed
by getting caught up in a

00:12:38.867 --> 00:12:39.567
thunderstorm.

00:12:39.567 --> 00:12:42.533
They could be disturbed by
running against a mountain

00:12:42.533 --> 00:12:45.867
range and being deflected,
running against a building and

00:12:45.867 --> 00:12:47.267
getting deflected.

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:51.267
But then, as the hours pass, it
naturally tends to want to

00:12:51.267 --> 00:12:54.467
return to a state of geostrophic
balance.

00:12:54.467 --> 00:12:59.000
It's a natural tendency in the
atmosphere for the wind to try

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.700
to readjust itself to
geostrophic balance.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.933
What you might do is leave a
couple of inches in your notes

00:13:05.933 --> 00:13:10.200
and either redraw the isobars
with some other orientation

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.767
and repeat the experiment.

00:13:12.767 --> 00:13:18.733
Or to be even more confusing,
perhaps, start that parcel off

00:13:18.733 --> 00:13:23.433
in some arbitrary direction and
imagine what's going to

00:13:23.433 --> 00:13:24.633
happen to it.

00:13:24.633 --> 00:13:26.733
If you start it off with some
speed, it's going to have a

00:13:26.733 --> 00:13:29.667
Coriolis force, but it's going
to be in the wrong direction

00:13:29.667 --> 00:13:31.500
for geostrophic balance.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.000
Then follow that parcel just
with your little sketch, and

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.867
see how it is that it loops
around and eventually

00:13:38.867 --> 00:13:41.000
reestablishes geostrophic
balance.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:41.867
It'll always get there.

00:13:41.867 --> 00:13:45.033
No matter what direction you
start that parcel, it'll loop

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:48.000
around in such a way that it'll
eventually end up in

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.033
geostrophic balance.

00:13:49.033 --> 00:13:51.233
So do some practice on that.

00:13:51.233 --> 00:13:54.667
Any questions on this process
of geostrophic adjustment?

00:13:57.367 --> 00:14:01.200
The same thing happens in
the oceans, by the way.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.933
The Coriolis force acts on
ocean currents, and ocean

00:14:05.933 --> 00:14:13.100
currents are even in a more
rigorous state of geostrophic

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.367
balance than is the
atmosphere.

00:14:15.367 --> 00:14:18.933
So these same principles we're
learning now apply to ocean

00:14:18.933 --> 00:14:21.833
currents as well.

00:14:21.833 --> 00:14:25.367
It's ironic that this Coriolis
force, which is so small that

00:14:25.367 --> 00:14:31.000
we don't notice it in our
everyday lives, yet has this

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.733
dominant force on
a larger scale.

00:14:33.733 --> 00:14:34.100
Yes.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.967
STUDENT: What do the arrows
going up and down and then

00:14:37.967 --> 00:14:40.433
right by "air flow"-- it's
starting to curve-- what do

00:14:40.433 --> 00:14:40.933
those represent?

00:14:40.933 --> 00:14:41.567
PROFESSOR: These?

00:14:41.567 --> 00:14:43.133
STUDENT: No, on the Coriolis--

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:45.533
PROFESSOR: So this one is the pressure

00:14:45.533 --> 00:14:47.700
gradient force.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.367
And I don't know why
they've changed it.

00:14:50.367 --> 00:14:51.733
The artist wasn't
careful here.

00:14:51.733 --> 00:14:52.833
But this pressure gradient--

00:14:52.833 --> 00:14:55.600
because these isobars are
equally spaced, four millibars

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.900
and four millibars, this
pressure gradient force should

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.233
be the same always
in this diagram.

00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:03.033
And this one is the
Coriolis force.

00:15:03.033 --> 00:15:06.800
Notice it's always at right
angles to the motion vector.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.333
So when the parcel's moving in
that direction, the Coriolis

00:15:09.333 --> 00:15:10.967
force is like that.

00:15:10.967 --> 00:15:14.233
When the parcel's moving in that
direction, the Coriolis

00:15:14.233 --> 00:15:15.133
force is like this.

00:15:15.133 --> 00:15:17.867
So you need to adhere to that
when you're constructing these

00:15:17.867 --> 00:15:20.633
little cartoons, to be sure
you're always drawing the

00:15:20.633 --> 00:15:25.067
Coriolis force perpendicular
to the motion vector.

00:15:25.067 --> 00:15:27.867
And in this simple case, the
pressure gradient force will

00:15:27.867 --> 00:15:31.567
always be towards the north,
because the pressure decreases

00:15:31.567 --> 00:15:32.833
towards the north.

00:15:36.267 --> 00:15:38.700
Good question.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:45.000
Now, this reversal in the two
hemispheres, I think it's

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.200
pretty clear why it happens.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.033
I wanted to show you these
two satellite images of

00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:51.733
hurricanes.

00:15:51.733 --> 00:15:53.000
This one, you know
where it is.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.733
There's Florida and Cuba.

00:15:55.733 --> 00:15:57.633
So this is in the Northern
Hemisphere.

00:15:57.633 --> 00:16:01.300
Now, to be honest with you,
looking at the top of a

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:05.033
hurricane with a satellite, even
if it's in motion, it's a

00:16:05.033 --> 00:16:07.767
little bit hard to tell what
direction the winds are going

00:16:07.767 --> 00:16:09.633
near the surface.

00:16:09.633 --> 00:16:12.567
Because what you're seeing are
these high anvil clouds that

00:16:12.567 --> 00:16:16.667
are spreading out near the
tropopause and covering most

00:16:16.667 --> 00:16:21.233
everything, and these clouds
tend to rotate maybe in this

00:16:21.233 --> 00:16:23.333
direction near the center, but
then further out, they're

00:16:23.333 --> 00:16:25.367
rotating in the opposite
direction.

00:16:25.367 --> 00:16:27.933
So it's a little bit
complicated, so I'm not going

00:16:27.933 --> 00:16:31.300
to try to convince you that you
can determine which way

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.700
that thing is spinning from
that still picture.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.400
I'm not going to claim that.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.667
But nevertheless, I will ask
you to notice that, in

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:45.600
general, these two photographs
are opposite.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:45.633
Right?

00:16:45.633 --> 00:16:49.767
The spiral bands go off outwards
and to the right

00:16:49.767 --> 00:16:52.867
here, outwards to
the left below.

00:16:52.867 --> 00:16:56.200
But here, outwards to the left
and outwards to the right.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:01.133
So that general spiral pattern
is reversed in the two

00:17:01.133 --> 00:17:01.967
hemispheres.

00:17:01.967 --> 00:17:04.267
That, you can see
for yourself.

00:17:04.267 --> 00:17:08.233
And were you to look, were you
to have some data about the

00:17:08.233 --> 00:17:10.733
winds near the surface of the
Earth, you would find the

00:17:10.733 --> 00:17:14.033
winds moving very rapidly in a
counterclockwise direction

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:17.400
here and in the clockwise
direction there.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.333
So they really are reversed
in the two hemispheres.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:26.133
We'll talk about hurricanes
probably starting next time or

00:17:26.133 --> 00:17:29.433
the time after that, and
we'll struggle with

00:17:29.433 --> 00:17:29.933
this a little bit.

00:17:29.933 --> 00:17:35.467
For example, you might ask
what would happen if a

00:17:35.467 --> 00:17:39.033
hurricane tried to cross
the Equator?

00:17:39.033 --> 00:17:46.200
Well, would it have to switch
its direction of rotation?

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:50.767
The answer is probably
so, but it's never

00:17:50.767 --> 00:17:52.033
been observed to happen.

00:17:52.033 --> 00:17:53.500
A hurricane has never

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.333
successfully crossed the Equator.

00:17:56.333 --> 00:17:57.700
It would be in a foreign
country, right?

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.100
In other words, it's constructed
itself to be

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.233
appropriate with the sense of
the Coriolis force in the

00:18:04.233 --> 00:18:05.433
Northern Hemisphere.

00:18:05.433 --> 00:18:07.667
If you tried to push that into
the Southern Hemisphere, it

00:18:07.667 --> 00:18:12.633
would have to really fall apart
and then rebuild itself

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:15.400
in the opposite direction.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.900
That's never been
seen to happen.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.000
We'll talk more about things
like that when we get into

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.233
hurricanes.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.133
Let's see.

00:18:24.133 --> 00:18:27.000
I was going to talk about
toilet bowl mythology.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.500
So how many of you heard
the legend of the

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.733
toilet bowls in Australia?

00:18:34.733 --> 00:18:38.733
So the legend is that if you
flush the toilet bowl in

00:18:38.733 --> 00:18:42.567
Australia, the water will swirl
down in the opposite

00:18:42.567 --> 00:18:46.667
direction to that in the
Northern Hemisphere.

00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:49.433
Well, I don't think
that's true.

00:18:49.433 --> 00:18:55.633
I have tested it on occasion,
but the problem is that the

00:18:55.633 --> 00:18:58.733
Coriolis force acting on a small
scale is a rather small

00:18:58.733 --> 00:19:02.700
force, and other things
may dominate.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.633
And here's what would dominate
in the case of a toilet bowl

00:19:05.633 --> 00:19:08.600
or any small body of water.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.900
If you take a tank of water and
fill it and you're even

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.200
the least little bit careless,
you're going to be pouring the

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.500
water into that off-center a
little bit, and you're going

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:23.200
to be giving it a little bit of
swirl to begin with, just

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.900
from the way you filled
the basin.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.767
Now, when you pull a plug at
the bottom and that water

00:19:31.767 --> 00:19:35.367
begins to move towards the
center and then drain out, the

00:19:35.367 --> 00:19:40.133
conservation of angular momentum
will amplify whatever

00:19:40.133 --> 00:19:42.567
little swirl is in there.

00:19:42.567 --> 00:19:45.833
And so it'll end up swirling
faster and faster as you draw

00:19:45.833 --> 00:19:49.100
the water out, but in the
direction of the swirl that

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.867
you gave it initially.

00:19:51.867 --> 00:19:56.067
And in almost every case, that's
going to dominate over

00:19:56.067 --> 00:19:59.800
that weak Coriolis force acting
on such a small scale.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.367
Now, this idea was tested some
years ago up at the Woods Hole

00:20:04.367 --> 00:20:05.667
Oceanographic Institution.

00:20:05.667 --> 00:20:08.967
They took a large tank of water,
about this size and

00:20:08.967 --> 00:20:13.233
about my height, and they filled
it ever so carefully to

00:20:13.233 --> 00:20:14.933
avoid swirl.

00:20:14.933 --> 00:20:16.000
But that wasn't good enough.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.033
They then lowered into it a
kind of a honeycomb set of

00:20:20.033 --> 00:20:25.200
dividers that, once it was down
in there, would stop any

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.167
swirl that was existing.

00:20:28.167 --> 00:20:30.800
They then pulled it out
carefully and waited for

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:37.167
several days to get rid of any
other remaining swirl.

00:20:37.167 --> 00:20:41.100
Then they pulled the plug in
the middle at the bottom.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:45.967
And it took several hours to see
it, but gradually, there

00:20:45.967 --> 00:20:50.333
was a swirl observed, and it was
due to the Coriolis force.

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:53.333
In other words, as the air
moved-- as the water moved in

00:20:53.333 --> 00:20:55.900
towards the center, the
deflecting force took the

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.700
water that way, this one took
the water that way, acting to

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:03.400
the right of that motion towards
the center, and lo and

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.033
behold, they did get
a cyclonic swirl--

00:21:07.033 --> 00:21:10.033
that is, a counterclockwise
swirl--

00:21:10.033 --> 00:21:11.733
due to the Coriolis force.

00:21:11.733 --> 00:21:15.967
But I tell that story because
of the extent you have to go

00:21:15.967 --> 00:21:18.733
to to get that effect
to dominate

00:21:18.733 --> 00:21:22.667
over the initial swirl.

00:21:22.667 --> 00:21:27.967
So don't expect to find that
as you switch hemispheres.

00:21:27.967 --> 00:21:28.733
You'd have to do the

00:21:28.733 --> 00:21:29.800
experiment much more carefully.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.467
Now, that leads me
to this story.

00:21:32.467 --> 00:21:37.500
So years ago, I was in Kenya,
driving north to south across

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.400
the Equator.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:45.800
And there's a number of souvenir
shops at the Equator,

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.033
with signs like this out front
or other signs on the building

00:21:49.033 --> 00:21:52.467
that say, get your Equator
souvenirs here.

00:21:52.467 --> 00:21:54.233
And we stopped at one of
them, and the owner

00:21:54.233 --> 00:21:54.933
came running out.

00:21:54.933 --> 00:21:59.467
And before he allowed us to go
in the store, he wanted to

00:21:59.467 --> 00:22:03.733
prove to us that his store was
the one that was really right

00:22:03.733 --> 00:22:06.300
on the Equator, and all those
others we could see up and

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.533
down the road were fake.

00:22:09.533 --> 00:22:11.467
And so he did a little
experiment for us.

00:22:11.467 --> 00:22:12.133
You can see that.

00:22:12.133 --> 00:22:15.600
But he's got a little red
plastic dish with a hole in

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.600
the bottom, and then a blue
bucket beneath that.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:23.367
Now, here I am watching him like
a hawk, because this is

00:22:23.367 --> 00:22:24.233
my subject, right?

00:22:24.233 --> 00:22:29.367
So this is a little toward the
end of the experiment.

00:22:29.367 --> 00:22:36.100
First, he walked a few tens of
yards north of the sign, and

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.700
he put his finger under the
hole on the red dish and

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:43.867
poured the water into it, put
a few matchsticks on the top

00:22:43.867 --> 00:22:47.667
so we could see the swirl that
was developed, and when he

00:22:47.667 --> 00:22:51.100
took his finger off the hole,
the water rushed out the hole.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.200
And indeed, it did swirl down.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.633
He then walked several meters
south of his sign and repeated

00:22:59.633 --> 00:23:03.067
the experiment, and indeed,
it swirled down in

00:23:03.067 --> 00:23:04.300
the opposite direction.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.067
He then went right under the
sign-- and that's the picture

00:23:09.067 --> 00:23:10.400
you see there--

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.667
and I noticed that
his protocol was

00:23:12.667 --> 00:23:13.467
a little bit different.

00:23:13.467 --> 00:23:17.567
He poured in most of the water
and then waited for a few

00:23:17.567 --> 00:23:22.733
seconds, then poured in the
rest, then took his finger off

00:23:22.733 --> 00:23:26.667
the hole, and the water ran
right down without a swirl.

00:23:26.667 --> 00:23:30.100
He did a very nice job
on this experiment.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.967
And of course, the point was
that the Coriolis force has

00:23:32.967 --> 00:23:35.600
one sign to the north of the
Equator, another sign to the

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.533
south of the Equator, and
there's no Coriolis force

00:23:38.533 --> 00:23:40.933
right at the Equator.

00:23:40.933 --> 00:23:44.567
However, I didn't have the heart
to tell him that he had

00:23:44.567 --> 00:23:45.400
it backwards.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.367
Did you notice the way
I moved my hand?

00:23:47.367 --> 00:23:50.233
When he was north of the
Equator, he had it swirling

00:23:50.233 --> 00:23:53.400
down this way, and when he was
south of the Equator, he had

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.967
it swirling down this way, just
the opposite of what the

00:23:55.967 --> 00:23:57.967
Coriolis force would do.

00:23:57.967 --> 00:24:00.133
Nevertheless, we were so pleased
we went in and bought

00:24:00.133 --> 00:24:01.033
lots of souvenirs.

00:24:01.033 --> 00:24:03.467
So he won the day.

00:24:03.467 --> 00:24:07.800
But it makes my point that there
is this odd situation

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:12.367
that the Coriolis force is such
a small force that you

00:24:12.367 --> 00:24:15.567
won't see it on small-scale
experiments like this, because

00:24:15.567 --> 00:24:18.933
other effects-- for example,
this initial swirl--

00:24:18.933 --> 00:24:22.833
is going to dominate over that
small Coriolis force.

00:24:22.833 --> 00:24:26.267
But on the large scale,
it'll dominate.

00:24:26.267 --> 00:24:28.667
Questions on the
Coriolis force?

00:24:28.667 --> 00:24:32.133
We have a few minutes where
I'd be happy to take your

00:24:32.133 --> 00:24:33.900
questions about the
Coriolis force.

00:24:37.833 --> 00:24:39.100
Anything?

00:24:51.367 --> 00:24:52.933
Well, we're going
to switch gears.

00:24:52.933 --> 00:24:56.767
We're going to start talking
about storm types.

00:24:56.767 --> 00:25:05.867
And I want to start out by
showing you a picture that

00:25:05.867 --> 00:25:09.667
Jude gave me, our videographer
in the back of the room here.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.500
In New Haven a few days ago,
he took this nice shot of a

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.667
mammatus cloud.

00:25:16.667 --> 00:25:18.467
We're going to be talking about
thunderstorms in just a

00:25:18.467 --> 00:25:21.400
minute in this course.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.333
By the way, if anybody else has
nice pictures of clouds

00:25:24.333 --> 00:25:26.633
that you've taken yourself,
don't hesitate to

00:25:26.633 --> 00:25:27.667
send them to me.

00:25:27.667 --> 00:25:32.200
I may even put them up
on our class website.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.400
But that's a real nice one.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.233
Remember, this kind of cloud
occurs underneath a

00:25:36.233 --> 00:25:37.433
thunderstorm anvil.

00:25:37.433 --> 00:25:41.033
So cumulonimbus builds up, hits
the tropopause, the anvil

00:25:41.033 --> 00:25:43.500
spreads out, and then underneath
that, you get these

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:49.567
falling pendants of cloud that
take on this appearance of a

00:25:49.567 --> 00:25:51.933
mammatus cloud.

00:25:51.933 --> 00:25:53.533
But now we're going to talk
about storms, and we're going

00:25:53.533 --> 00:25:55.800
to stay on this subject
for a day or two.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.967
It's a huge subject.

00:25:56.967 --> 00:26:00.367
Your book is really good and
voluminous on this subject,

00:26:00.367 --> 00:26:02.467
and I assume you've
already read a

00:26:02.467 --> 00:26:03.300
number of these chapters.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.133
I hope you're doing that.

00:26:06.133 --> 00:26:11.967
But the tough thing is
to define a storm.

00:26:11.967 --> 00:26:14.033
The word "storm," what the
heck does it mean?

00:26:14.033 --> 00:26:14.100
I honestly--

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.833
I didn't look it up in the
dictionary, but my

00:26:17.833 --> 00:26:20.767
definition would be--

00:26:20.767 --> 00:26:23.933
a meteorologist's definition
would be that it represents

00:26:23.933 --> 00:26:27.667
some kind of a local energy
transformation, a

00:26:27.667 --> 00:26:31.167
transformation from one kind of
an energy to another, for

00:26:31.167 --> 00:26:36.233
example, maybe potential energy
to wind energy, to

00:26:36.233 --> 00:26:38.867
kinetic energy of motion,
or something like that.

00:26:41.867 --> 00:26:43.933
It's not an object.

00:26:43.933 --> 00:26:46.100
It's not a physical object.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.233
In fact, the air that's involved
in a storm might even

00:26:49.233 --> 00:26:51.367
be flowing through it.

00:26:51.367 --> 00:26:55.567
The air that's in a storm today,
that storm may still

00:26:55.567 --> 00:26:57.533
exist tomorrow, but it may have
a whole different set of

00:26:57.533 --> 00:26:58.800
air that comprises it.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.900
So it's not a physical object.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:08.333
It's a pattern of winds, of
vertical motions of clouds, of

00:27:08.333 --> 00:27:10.000
precipitation in the air.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.800
This is what makes it so
fascinating to study, because

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.733
its a little bit--

00:27:14.733 --> 00:27:17.100
all these things are a little
bit mysterious.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.300
They're not exactly objects.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.533
They're patterns of complicated
fluid motion

00:27:21.533 --> 00:27:25.900
within a larger atmosphere.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.900
Now, they may be dangerous,
but I don't want to

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:28.833
define it that way.

00:27:28.833 --> 00:27:32.467
I don't want to define a storm
as something that necessarily

00:27:32.467 --> 00:27:36.933
causes damage or takes
human lives.

00:27:36.933 --> 00:27:40.567
In fact, in some cases, it may
be the only thing that brings

00:27:40.567 --> 00:27:41.833
needed rain.

00:27:43.833 --> 00:27:47.767
Most types of storms produce
precipitation in some way, and

00:27:47.767 --> 00:27:51.133
in many climates, that
is the rain producer.

00:27:51.133 --> 00:27:53.733
So storms should not be
considered all bad.

00:27:53.733 --> 00:27:55.767
Typically, they are short-lived,
however.

00:27:55.767 --> 00:28:00.533
I can't think of any examples
where a storm of any of the

00:28:00.533 --> 00:28:04.967
types I will define in just a
moment exists more than three

00:28:04.967 --> 00:28:05.867
or four days.

00:28:05.867 --> 00:28:10.767
Now, there may be other storms
nearby that grow as that one

00:28:10.767 --> 00:28:14.600
decays, but if you try to track
an individual storm,

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:19.433
like a hurricane, normally, a
few days, and they've gone

00:28:19.433 --> 00:28:22.000
through their life cycle.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.433
Some of these have natural life
cycles, and some of them

00:28:24.433 --> 00:28:27.333
just die for other reasons.

00:28:27.333 --> 00:28:33.033
And I've indicated that we're
interested in climate in this

00:28:33.033 --> 00:28:34.567
course as well.

00:28:34.567 --> 00:28:36.467
But you can't define
climate without

00:28:36.467 --> 00:28:37.767
understanding storms either.

00:28:37.767 --> 00:28:40.933
Because the storms that occur
in a particular location are

00:28:40.933 --> 00:28:43.000
part of the definition
of the climate.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.800
For example, here in New Haven,
we get a certain amount

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:52.700
of rain in the summertime, and
almost all of that comes from

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:57.933
thunderstorms. We get rain in
the wintertime, and almost all

00:28:57.933 --> 00:29:01.433
of that comes from mid-latitude
frontal cyclones.

00:29:01.433 --> 00:29:05.067
So without knowing something
about storm types, you really

00:29:05.067 --> 00:29:08.233
don't have much to say
about climate either.

00:29:08.233 --> 00:29:13.100
They really are part of the
recurring patterns of

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:16.200
temperature and precipitation
and wind that occur in any

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.000
particular location.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.833
Any questions about what I
mean by a storm, then?

00:29:21.833 --> 00:29:23.067
I'm using it very broadly.

00:29:26.433 --> 00:29:29.600
Now, with those definitions, I
want to break them down into

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:34.267
two broad categories, convective
and frontal.

00:29:34.267 --> 00:29:38.533
And convective clouds--
convective storms are those

00:29:38.533 --> 00:29:42.000
that are driven by latent
heat release.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.967
We're going to talk about two
or three different kinds of

00:29:44.967 --> 00:29:50.533
convective storms, but they all
share the property that

00:29:50.533 --> 00:29:55.633
the energy that drives them is
the heat that's released when

00:29:55.633 --> 00:30:02.100
water vapor condenses to
form liquid or ice.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.900
And because they depend on
latent heat release, you need

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:10.833
to have a lot of water vapor to
begin with in the air, and

00:30:10.833 --> 00:30:15.600
that means these are going to
be warm-season storms--

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.267
warm air can hold more
water vapor--

00:30:18.267 --> 00:30:22.300
or storms that occur in the
tropics, where you have lots

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.800
of water vapor all the time.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.733
But anyway, they're warm storms.
You're not going to

00:30:27.733 --> 00:30:29.933
get thunderstorms in--

00:30:29.933 --> 00:30:32.433
very rarely would you get
a thunderstorm in high

00:30:32.433 --> 00:30:34.600
latitudes, up in the arctic,
for example.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.267
It's not unheard of, but
it's quite rare.

00:30:37.267 --> 00:30:40.300
And when you do get it, it's
only because there's been a

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.800
big push of warm air temporarily
up into the high

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:48.767
latitudes that has allowed a
thunderstorm to occur there.

00:30:48.767 --> 00:30:53.033
A frontal storm, the other broad
category, their energy

00:30:53.033 --> 00:30:57.567
source is the horizontal
gradient in temperature.

00:30:57.567 --> 00:31:03.600
If I have cold air next to warm
air, that represents a

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:08.633
potential source of energy
because the warm air would

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:12.800
like to rise, and the cold
air would like to sink.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:18.000
So holding them side by side
is only a temporary thing.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.133
When I release it in some way,
motion is going to begin to

00:31:21.133 --> 00:31:23.333
occur, and in some cases,
that'll develop

00:31:23.333 --> 00:31:27.067
into a frontal storm.

00:31:27.067 --> 00:31:31.000
I say cold season because,
remember, due to the tilt of

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.867
the Earth, it's in the
wintertime in mid-latitudes

00:31:36.867 --> 00:31:39.300
when you've got the big
differential heating.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:43.333
The pole is getting no sunlight,
the Equator is

00:31:43.333 --> 00:31:48.033
getting a lot, and so it's in
the cold season of each year

00:31:48.033 --> 00:31:52.900
for the respective hemispheres
that you get the strong

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.200
temperature differences,
which will then allow

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.267
frontal storms to form.

00:31:57.267 --> 00:31:59.867
Now, this is easy to remember,
because the definition of a

00:31:59.867 --> 00:32:05.633
front itself is a region of
strong temperature gradient.

00:32:05.633 --> 00:32:10.267
So it's easy to remember what
is the energy source for a

00:32:10.267 --> 00:32:11.533
frontal storm.

00:32:14.067 --> 00:32:22.767
So first, we're going to talk
about convective storms. And

00:32:22.767 --> 00:32:24.867
I'm just going to talk
about three.

00:32:24.867 --> 00:32:29.733
Airmass thunderstorms, severe
thunderstorms, your book does

00:32:29.733 --> 00:32:31.467
a good job on these.

00:32:31.467 --> 00:32:34.667
I'm not going to say much about
the different types of

00:32:34.667 --> 00:32:38.800
severe thunderstorms, but there
are subcategories within

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.800
the general domain of severe
thunderstorms. And then

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.433
hurricanes fall into that
category as well.

00:32:45.433 --> 00:32:48.633
So what I'm saying is that all
of these storms are driven by

00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:50.567
the energy from latent
heat release.

00:32:50.567 --> 00:32:55.567
And remember, that number is
about 2 and 1/2 million joules

00:32:55.567 --> 00:32:58.367
per kilogram of water vapor.

00:32:58.367 --> 00:33:02.067
So for every kilogram of water
vapor that you condense, you

00:33:02.067 --> 00:33:05.400
get 2 and 1/2 million joules
of energy added to the

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.700
atmosphere in the
form of heat.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.900
But then that may make that air
rise, and that'll get the

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.067
whole storm going.

00:33:14.067 --> 00:33:19.800
So it all goes back to this
rather large latent heat

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.600
that's present when water
vapor condenses.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:29.300
So the first and the most benign
of these is the airmass

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.033
thunderstorm.

00:33:31.033 --> 00:33:36.367
It's called an airmass
thunderstorm because basically

00:33:36.367 --> 00:33:38.967
there's a property of the
atmosphere that would allow

00:33:38.967 --> 00:33:39.767
them to form.

00:33:39.767 --> 00:33:43.767
And so when we say that a warm,
tropical air mass has

00:33:43.767 --> 00:33:50.000
moved into New England with the
properties of being warm,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.967
not very stable, and not very
strongly sheared, then

00:33:55.967 --> 00:33:57.667
thunderstorms can occur.

00:33:57.667 --> 00:34:01.433
So we've kind of included here
the fact that it's the nature

00:34:01.433 --> 00:34:04.667
of the air mass that is going
to control whether or not

00:34:04.667 --> 00:34:06.767
these thunderstorms occur.

00:34:06.767 --> 00:34:09.733
And that's why they're called
airmass thunderstorms.

00:34:09.733 --> 00:34:11.633
So they go through
a life cycle.

00:34:11.633 --> 00:34:17.733
They start as a fair-weather
cumulus cloud, but there is

00:34:17.733 --> 00:34:21.733
enough water vapor in the
atmosphere so that as the air

00:34:21.733 --> 00:34:26.100
begins to rise, the latent heat
addition is sufficient to

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.800
keep that air moving upwards.

00:34:32.267 --> 00:34:34.767
It'll keep going, under many
circumstances, all the way

00:34:34.767 --> 00:34:38.067
until it reaches
the tropopause.

00:34:38.067 --> 00:34:40.933
It'll flatten out at the
tropopause, maybe overshoot it

00:34:40.933 --> 00:34:43.533
a little bit, but generally
flatten out.

00:34:43.533 --> 00:34:46.467
And about the time it gets
there, it'll start to rain

00:34:46.467 --> 00:34:47.700
heavily out the bottom.

00:34:51.067 --> 00:34:55.900
The process by which the
raindrops are made is almost

00:34:55.900 --> 00:35:00.500
always the ice phase mechanism
in these clouds.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.067
Remember, it may be very warm
at the surface-- after all,

00:35:03.067 --> 00:35:06.433
this is a summertime
phenomenon--

00:35:06.433 --> 00:35:08.900
but nevertheless, because it
gets colder as you go up-- and

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.700
here's the zero degrees
Celsius line--

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:14.533
once that cloud gets above the
zero degrees Celsius line,

00:35:14.533 --> 00:35:19.000
you've got supercooled water
that'll then start the ice

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.200
phase process going to generate
at first snowflakes.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:27.167
Then they'll melt as they fall,
and they'll fall as rain

00:35:27.167 --> 00:35:28.600
out the bottom.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:32.100
There may be some lightning
coming out of those clouds.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:36.300
If they are moving rapidly
across the landscape, they

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.267
will just give you a brief
shower, which won't be too

00:35:39.267 --> 00:35:40.033
much of a problem.

00:35:40.033 --> 00:35:42.933
If they happen to be stationary,
even though they

00:35:42.933 --> 00:35:46.367
may only last for an hour, if
they're stationary, they might

00:35:46.367 --> 00:35:48.933
cause some local flooding.

00:35:48.933 --> 00:35:52.533
So whether they cause flooding
depends not only on the rain

00:35:52.533 --> 00:35:55.333
rate from these systems but how
fast they're moving across

00:35:55.333 --> 00:35:57.700
the landscape, whether they're
distributing that

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:02.700
rain as they move.

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.033
There might also be some-- of
course, the lightning can

00:36:04.033 --> 00:36:04.733
cause damage.

00:36:04.733 --> 00:36:07.067
You could be struck by
lightning, or it

00:36:07.067 --> 00:36:08.033
could cause a fire.

00:36:08.033 --> 00:36:12.867
But normally, these are
not so damaging.

00:36:12.867 --> 00:36:16.500
In fact, they bring us most of
the summertime rainfall that

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:21.133
we count on in New Haven and
most of the rest of the world.

00:36:21.133 --> 00:36:24.733
In the warm season or the warm
climate zones, this is the

00:36:24.733 --> 00:36:26.833
primary rain producer.

00:36:26.833 --> 00:36:32.333
So it's definitely
a positive thing.

00:36:32.333 --> 00:36:34.000
Questions on airmass
thunderstorms?

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.767
I'll show you the distribution
of these in just a minute.

00:36:36.767 --> 00:36:41.067
But first I want to start
talking about the severe

00:36:41.067 --> 00:36:44.233
thunderstorms. Now, severe
thunderstorms require some of

00:36:44.233 --> 00:36:46.133
the same ingredients.

00:36:46.133 --> 00:36:51.367
You need to have a warm, moist
atmosphere, no strong

00:36:51.367 --> 00:36:55.033
inversions, because you've got
to get the air moving upwards.

00:36:55.033 --> 00:37:00.300
But the additional element
determining that you will get

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.933
a severe thunderstorm instead
of just an airmass

00:37:02.933 --> 00:37:06.900
thunderstorm is wind shear
in the troposphere.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.233
And here they've drawn up
on the right axis--

00:37:09.233 --> 00:37:14.233
the artist has drawn in a sense
of that, some low-level

00:37:14.233 --> 00:37:17.267
southeasterlies, weak
southeasterlies near the

00:37:17.267 --> 00:37:19.633
surface of the Earth, turning
to a jet stream

00:37:19.633 --> 00:37:21.133
from the west aloft.

00:37:21.133 --> 00:37:24.300
That's the kind of shear I'm
talking about, shear across

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.600
the whole tropopause.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:31.767
So now, instead of getting
this-- instead of getting this

00:37:31.767 --> 00:37:39.133
thunderstorm building up and
retaining a kind of symmetry,

00:37:39.133 --> 00:37:43.967
instead, as it builds up, it
gets tipped over by the shear.

00:37:43.967 --> 00:37:46.200
And that changes everything.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:46.533
Let me go back.

00:37:46.533 --> 00:37:49.267
I forgot to mention something
which is needed now in this

00:37:49.267 --> 00:37:52.933
argument, so let me go back for
a moment and point out to

00:37:52.933 --> 00:37:59.100
the fact that the air that is
rising is generally converging

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:03.833
into this storm until
the rain begins.

00:38:03.833 --> 00:38:04.300
Sorry.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.467
I forgot to mention this.

00:38:05.467 --> 00:38:06.400
This is important.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:12.900
Once the rain begins, the rain
falls below cloud base into

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:17.133
air that has a relative humidity
less than 100%, and

00:38:17.133 --> 00:38:20.867
some fraction of the raindrop
water mass is going to

00:38:20.867 --> 00:38:25.667
evaporate before those raindrops
hit the surface.

00:38:25.667 --> 00:38:31.367
That evaporation causes some
cooling in this area.

00:38:31.367 --> 00:38:35.633
And once that is well
established, the cooling by

00:38:35.633 --> 00:38:39.367
evaporation of raindrops, that
cool air begins to fall to the

00:38:39.367 --> 00:38:42.600
surface and spread out.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:46.033
When it does that, it shuts
off the inflow.

00:38:46.033 --> 00:38:49.100
Here we needed inflow to
keep that cloud going.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:53.000
Once the downburst begins, once
the cool air begins to

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.600
flow down and out, the supply of
warm air rising is cut off,

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.667
and this storm dies.

00:39:00.667 --> 00:39:03.700
And normally, that whole
sequence takes between an hour

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:06.500
and two hours, and
then it's gone.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:10.233
There may be other thunderstorms
popping up in

00:39:10.233 --> 00:39:13.433
the vicinity, but this one has
a very short lifetime,

00:39:13.433 --> 00:39:15.033
typically less than two hours.

00:39:15.033 --> 00:39:16.367
And it kills itself off.

00:39:16.367 --> 00:39:19.267
It's a form of suicide, where
the rain that falls out the

00:39:19.267 --> 00:39:24.333
bottom partially evaporates,
causes cool air, which rushes

00:39:24.333 --> 00:39:28.633
down to the surface, spreads
out, and cuts off the inflow

00:39:28.633 --> 00:39:30.833
to that storm.

00:39:30.833 --> 00:39:31.900
You will feel that.

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:36.067
If you are a few miles away
from this storm, you might

00:39:36.067 --> 00:39:40.667
hear the thunder coming
from the lightning.

00:39:40.667 --> 00:39:44.033
And then several minutes later,
there may be a cool

00:39:44.033 --> 00:39:49.200
gust of wind that comes to you
from the direction of that

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.300
thunderstorm.

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.267
That's this cool air
falling out of the

00:39:52.267 --> 00:39:54.200
bottom of the cloud.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:59.167
So watch for that, because if
you're aware, you can tell the

00:39:59.167 --> 00:40:02.833
outflows coming from each of
these storms as it progresses

00:40:02.833 --> 00:40:04.567
through the afternoon
or the evening.

00:40:04.567 --> 00:40:07.600
You'll feel these outflows
reaching you.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:12.100
Now, what's different about a
severe thunderstorm is that

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:16.500
because it's tipped over and
made more complicated, the

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:21.133
inflow continues on one side of
the storm, while the rain

00:40:21.133 --> 00:40:23.800
and the outflow is on the
other side of the storm.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.467
They don't cancel each other.

00:40:26.467 --> 00:40:30.333
Because it's sheared in this
way, you get air coming in

00:40:30.333 --> 00:40:34.767
from the back that gets caught
up in the rain, brought down

00:40:34.767 --> 00:40:38.667
to the surface to form the cool
air and the gust front.

00:40:38.667 --> 00:40:41.967
And then out ahead of the gust
front comes the warm air,

00:40:41.967 --> 00:40:45.933
which is the fuel for the
thunderstorm, that'll rise up

00:40:45.933 --> 00:40:48.933
in this way and spread out
to the right and a

00:40:48.933 --> 00:40:50.100
little bit to the left.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:56.867
So the downdraft caused by
evaporation and the updraft,

00:40:56.867 --> 00:41:01.033
which is generating the cloud,
do not-- they're not in the

00:41:01.033 --> 00:41:03.933
same place, so they don't
cancel each other.

00:41:03.933 --> 00:41:06.733
So this can be a long-lived
storm.

00:41:06.733 --> 00:41:10.833
This can exist for many hours,
just trucking across the

00:41:10.833 --> 00:41:15.933
landscape, sucking up air from
one side, spitting it out the

00:41:15.933 --> 00:41:18.667
back along with rain, and
continuing to kind of move

00:41:18.667 --> 00:41:23.833
along like that until conditions
change, until it

00:41:23.833 --> 00:41:29.133
encounters air that's too dry
or whatever might change,

00:41:29.133 --> 00:41:30.233
might eventually
kill the storm.

00:41:30.233 --> 00:41:31.933
But it could even
last overnight.

00:41:31.933 --> 00:41:35.267
In other words, it could start
this afternoon, and the same

00:41:35.267 --> 00:41:38.333
storm could exist through the
night-- in some cases, even

00:41:38.333 --> 00:41:40.433
into the next day--

00:41:40.433 --> 00:41:44.867
because it doesn't have a way to
naturally kill itself off.

00:41:44.867 --> 00:41:46.300
Also, these are much
more severe.

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.000
They are broader in extent.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.767
The updrafts are quite
a bit stronger.

00:41:51.767 --> 00:41:54.867
Instead of being two or three
or four meters per second

00:41:54.867 --> 00:41:58.800
updraft, they could be 10 or
even 15 meters per second

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.333
updraft speed.

00:42:00.333 --> 00:42:05.533
And this gives rise to a whole
set of new dangers that come

00:42:05.533 --> 00:42:08.833
along with this storm.

00:42:08.833 --> 00:42:11.333
Here's a picture of one.

00:42:11.333 --> 00:42:15.600
The updraft is back in here,
coming right up through there.

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.367
And there's the rain
back in the rear.

00:42:19.367 --> 00:42:22.167
The anvil-- you can't see the
top of it, but the anvil is up

00:42:22.167 --> 00:42:23.433
here somewhere.

00:42:26.633 --> 00:42:28.833
There's one from a distance.

00:42:28.833 --> 00:42:30.133
We can't see much.

00:42:30.133 --> 00:42:33.133
I think this is where the air
is coming up, on this side.

00:42:33.133 --> 00:42:35.100
The rain is back here.

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:37.467
There's the anvil
spreading out.

00:42:37.467 --> 00:42:37.867
Yes.

00:42:37.867 --> 00:42:40.233
STUDENT: What drives what
direction the storm moves?

00:42:40.233 --> 00:42:43.500
PROFESSOR: So it's going to move by the

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.967
direction of the winds in the
middle of the troposphere.

00:42:46.967 --> 00:42:49.733
Typically, the winds around 500
millibars will determine

00:42:49.733 --> 00:42:51.600
how that storm moves.

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.267
That's a good question.

00:42:53.267 --> 00:42:58.233
So normally, from west to east,
but it'll depend on the

00:42:58.233 --> 00:42:59.867
local conditions.

00:42:59.867 --> 00:43:02.433
Could be in some other direction
if the regional

00:43:02.433 --> 00:43:06.833
winds are from a different
direction.

00:43:06.833 --> 00:43:10.533
Here's a picture from space
showing the anvil clouds

00:43:10.533 --> 00:43:11.767
popping up on this side.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:20.533
So this list is probably not
inclusive, but I want to

00:43:20.533 --> 00:43:23.133
mention at least these things.

00:43:23.133 --> 00:43:25.167
What damage do you get from
severe thunderstorms?

00:43:25.167 --> 00:43:28.733
Well, heavy rain and flooding.

00:43:28.733 --> 00:43:31.733
The rain rates can
be very high.

00:43:31.733 --> 00:43:34.667
And again, if they're moving--
if the storm's moving slowly,

00:43:34.667 --> 00:43:36.800
that's the most dangerous
situation, because it'll put a

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:41.167
lot of water into
each watershed.

00:43:41.167 --> 00:43:45.000
Because the updraft speeds are
so large and there's a lot of

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.167
supercooled water above the zero
degrees Celsius line, you

00:43:49.167 --> 00:43:53.267
can develop riming, which will
then grow and grow and grow,

00:43:53.267 --> 00:43:57.433
and that hailstone can be
suspended for maybe 15 or 20

00:43:57.433 --> 00:44:01.033
minutes, even as it grows,
because of the very strong

00:44:01.033 --> 00:44:03.033
updraft speed.

00:44:03.033 --> 00:44:05.800
So it'll continue to grow until
it finally gets too big,

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.167
and then it'll finally
fall out.

00:44:07.167 --> 00:44:11.200
But by that time, it may be
quite a chunk of ice that has

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.200
grown by riming.

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.700
And then as that falls to Earth,
it picks up a lot of

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:17.133
speed, and that could cause
damage to crops,

00:44:17.133 --> 00:44:18.900
buildings, or people.

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:24.233
There will be usually hundreds
if not thousands of lightning

00:44:24.233 --> 00:44:27.467
strikes from these severe
thunderstorms, and that's a

00:44:27.467 --> 00:44:30.400
real danger.

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.833
And so these are big lightning
producers.

00:44:33.833 --> 00:44:35.933
Your book describes how
lightning is produced.

00:44:35.933 --> 00:44:39.667
It has to do with ice crystals
bouncing into each other and

00:44:39.667 --> 00:44:42.700
then being carried off by
different vertical motions.

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:45.967
When they strike into each
other, they separate charge.

00:44:45.967 --> 00:44:49.400
And electrical charges of
one sign get carried up,

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:52.300
developing a big voltage
difference between the upper

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.267
part of the cloud and
the lower, or the

00:44:54.267 --> 00:44:55.767
cloud and the ground.

00:44:55.767 --> 00:44:58.800
And then you get-- when that
breaks down, you'll get

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.733
lightning strikes.

00:45:01.733 --> 00:45:02.600
Tornadic winds.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:08.933
Tornadoes are formed by severe
thunderstorms. This is a very

00:45:08.933 --> 00:45:12.000
important aspect of them.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.500
Unfortunately, one of the
least well understood.

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:18.367
There have been a number of
recent field projects, one

00:45:18.367 --> 00:45:26.500
just summer of 2010, in which,
once again, we mobilized

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:31.000
dozens of radars on mobile
trucks and all kinds of

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.067
sophisticated instruments to
try to measure tornadoes at

00:45:36.067 --> 00:45:37.667
the moment of generation.

00:45:37.667 --> 00:45:39.800
It's so difficult to do, because
they're random, and

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:40.967
they're hard to predict.

00:45:40.967 --> 00:45:43.333
So how do you get the trucks
and the people and the

00:45:43.333 --> 00:45:46.800
instruments together right at
the point where that tornado

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.067
is going to form?

00:45:48.067 --> 00:45:49.767
We're working very
hard at that.

00:45:49.767 --> 00:45:51.400
And the literature on
this is fascinating.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:55.067
People are being so clever about
developing new ways to

00:45:55.067 --> 00:45:56.000
do these measurements.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.467
And yet today, we don't quite
understand how tornadoes form.

00:45:59.467 --> 00:46:04.933
We do understand this, however,
that these large,

00:46:04.933 --> 00:46:10.833
severe thunderstorms generate
a slow rotation within them.

00:46:10.833 --> 00:46:16.033
That's called the mesocyclone
or the mesovortex.

00:46:16.033 --> 00:46:18.467
We understand how that
forms, but that's a

00:46:18.467 --> 00:46:22.067
slow, large-scale vortex.

00:46:22.067 --> 00:46:26.533
It might be 40 or 50 kilometers
across and with

00:46:26.533 --> 00:46:31.433
wind speeds of only 4 or
5 meters per second.

00:46:31.433 --> 00:46:36.567
That certainly isn't the tornado
itself, but it may be

00:46:36.567 --> 00:46:40.000
that somehow that rotation
gets amplified near the

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.700
surface of the Earth in certain
spots that would

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:44.767
generate tornadoes.

00:46:44.767 --> 00:46:49.700
So it may be the mesovortex is
the precursor of the tornado

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:53.200
itself, but that's one of the
things we've been unable to

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.500
determine with scientific
certainty.

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:59.567
So this is a very open question,
and I'm not going to

00:46:59.567 --> 00:47:00.667
say much more about it.

00:47:00.667 --> 00:47:04.500
But if you want to dig in or
read about this, there's a lot

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.400
going on in research meteorology
today to try to

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.600
understand that question.

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.900
Now, here's another issue that
I'm going to mention

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.300
and then drop it.

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.433
Because there is-- speaking of
toilet bowl mythology, there

00:47:17.433 --> 00:47:20.200
is a little bit of
mythology here.

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.433
Some people will say if a
tornado is approaching your

00:47:23.433 --> 00:47:26.033
house, you should open
the windows.

00:47:26.033 --> 00:47:32.500
And the reason for that is that
there's low pressure in

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:33.500
the center of a tornado.

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.767
We know that's true.

00:47:35.767 --> 00:47:38.267
And if this low-pressure center
suddenly moves over

00:47:38.267 --> 00:47:41.133
your house, you've still got
high pressure inside your

00:47:41.133 --> 00:47:47.167
house, low pressure around it,
and your house will explode.

00:47:47.167 --> 00:47:49.200
And the way to prevent that,
of course, is to open the

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:53.000
windows so that pressure can
equalize more rapidly.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.033
Well, that little bit of advice
has been around for

00:47:56.033 --> 00:47:58.100
many, many years.

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:01.600
But I know that the recent
recommendation from the

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.900
National Weather Service is
that that probably is not

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.733
valid, or at least it's not--

00:48:06.733 --> 00:48:09.800
probably, by opening the
windows, the chances are

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.867
you'll do more damage to
your house than by

00:48:12.867 --> 00:48:14.033
keeping them closed.

00:48:14.033 --> 00:48:16.167
Either the wind will come in
or rain will come in and

00:48:16.167 --> 00:48:17.933
you'll get damage that way.

00:48:17.933 --> 00:48:21.433
There's no real strong evidence
that this pressure

00:48:21.433 --> 00:48:24.333
difference has an effect on
exploding your house.

00:48:24.333 --> 00:48:26.700
So I'm not going to say anything
categorical about

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:30.600
this except that, generally,
this is not considered to be

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:31.400
part of the story.

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:32.500
But I will say this one.

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:37.200
The gust front winds, so that
cool air that's generated by

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:41.367
evaporation below cloud base,
will fall to the surface of

00:48:41.367 --> 00:48:45.500
the Earth and then spread out
at speeds that can almost

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:48.933
approach the speed of
the tornadic winds.

00:48:48.933 --> 00:48:51.233
So the first thing that a
meteorologist will do when

00:48:51.233 --> 00:48:53.667
there's been a severe
thunderstorm and damage has

00:48:53.667 --> 00:48:56.867
been reported, he'll get in
his car or he'll get in a

00:48:56.867 --> 00:49:01.100
helicopter and he'll scout the
area and try to figure out was

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:05.300
the damage due to the gust
front winds or from the

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:06.400
tornadic winds?

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.500
That's question number
one whenever these

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:13.067
kind of storms occur.

00:49:13.067 --> 00:49:16.833
Can you separate the damage
caused by that cool downburst

00:49:16.833 --> 00:49:20.833
of air from the damage caused
by the tornado itself?

00:49:20.833 --> 00:49:22.300
We're out of time, but
we'll continue in

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:24.367
this theme on Wednesday.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.123
Prof: The first thing I
want to say is that there's a

00:00:05.123 --> 00:00:08.894
thesis to the course,
that you don't have to share,

00:00:08.894 --> 00:00:13.517
but that I'd like to test for
the next twelve or thirteen

00:00:13.517 --> 00:00:14.260
weeks.
 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.975
And that thesis is that
infectious diseases are too

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:23.030
important to leave solely to the
doctors.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.037
Epidemics, in other words,
have had an impact on history

00:00:28.037 --> 00:00:32.679
that I would regard as equal to
that of revolutions,

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:35.320
wars and economic crises.
 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.055
They are part of the big
picture of historical change,

00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:43.540
and not some exotic special
interest.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.480
Epidemic diseases have had an
enormous impact on religion,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.930
on the arts,
on the colonial expansion,

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.880
on the establishment of New
World slavery,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.497
on the rise of modern medicine,
and on strategies of public

00:01:01.497 --> 00:01:02.369
health.
 

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:07.539
To examine this thesis,
we won't be looking at all

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:08.700
diseases.
 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.319
We'll be looking only at a
subset of high impact infectious

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:17.700
diseases that have affected
Europe and North America.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.510
So this means certain
exclusions.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.774
We won't be looking at chronic
diseases, such as cancer,

00:01:25.774 --> 00:01:28.741
heart disease,
diabetes, asthma,

00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:29.890
obesity.
 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.275
We won't be examining
occupational diseases such as

00:01:35.275 --> 00:01:38.400
miner's lung or asbestosis.
 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.077
We'll eliminate also a whole
range of tropical diseases that

00:01:43.077 --> 00:01:47.280
haven't had a major impact on
the industrial West,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.090
such as dengue,
or sleeping sickness,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.300
or Chagas disease.
 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.780
All of these,
and other diseases,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.430
I would agree entirely are
important and worthy of study,

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.870
but it would take far more than
a semester to examine them all,

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.282
and lumping all diseases
together would lose all

00:02:08.282 --> 00:02:09.408
coherence.
 

00:02:09.408 --> 00:02:13.119
Epidemic diseases-- that is,
high impact,

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:18.591
infectious diseases--make sense
intellectually as a separate

00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:20.908
category of analysis.
 

00:02:20.908 --> 00:02:24.177
That is to say they were,
and still are,

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:27.865
experienced differently from
chronic disease,

00:02:27.865 --> 00:02:32.139
and give rise to distinctive
fears and anxiety.

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:36.794
As you can see in your own day,
having heart disease can be a

00:02:36.794 --> 00:02:40.128
frightening and even a lethal
experience.

00:02:40.128 --> 00:02:45.977
But it's qualitatively distinct
from being diagnosed with

00:02:45.977 --> 00:02:48.645
HIV/AIDS,
or, up to the middle of our

00:02:48.645 --> 00:02:50.339
century,
with syphilis,

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:53.680
or being stricken with Asiatic
cholera.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.729
Cardiovascular disease can have
massive impact,

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:01.419
but it doesn't give rise to
scapegoating,

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:05.879
to mass hysteria,
to outbursts of religiosity,

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.408
to works of literature and art.
 

00:03:08.408 --> 00:03:12.520
So, epidemic diseases are
distinctive and have left a

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.210
particular legacy in their wake.
 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.590
And since our interest is in
history,

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.870
we need to note that throughout
human history,

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.164
until the twentieth century,
and still today in the

00:03:23.164 --> 00:03:26.330
twenty-first century in the
developing world,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.521
infectious diseases have been
the most important cause of

00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:32.169
suffering and death.
 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:37.687
Infectious diseases today are
the leading cause worldwide of

00:03:37.687 --> 00:03:42.643
death, and one of the jobs of
our course is to give an

00:03:42.643 --> 00:03:45.729
explanation of why that's so.
 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:49.611
Furthermore,
we've had a number of recent

00:03:49.611 --> 00:03:53.980
scares from new diseases like
SARS, avian flu,

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.340
swine flu.
 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.413
We're living in the midst of a
global experience with the

00:04:00.413 --> 00:04:04.021
persistence of HIV/AIDS,
tuberculosis,

00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:08.763
malaria--and these events
remind us that epidemics are

00:04:08.763 --> 00:04:13.370
still major threats,
even in the industrial world.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.555
Indeed, how we deal with them
may be an important factor in

00:04:18.555 --> 00:04:22.310
whether and how we survive as a
species.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.267
So, the course will raise the
question of how prepared we are

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:27.930
today.
 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.240
What are our major defenses
against microbial disasters?

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.300
How do they evolve?
 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.690
How robust are they?
 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.269
And what are the most important
sources of vulnerability today?

00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:47.870
Well, then, let's think about
the geography of our course.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.879
Our focus will be primarily on
Europe and North America;

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:57.810
and I wish to say entirely for
reasons of manageability.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.985
And you'll be grateful because
if we attempted to include the

00:05:01.985 --> 00:05:05.050
whole of the world throughout
the period,

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.175
and all tropical diseases,
you'd have a reading list that

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:13.449
would be four or five times as
long as the one you have.

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.980
But I would also say that when
we come to the twentieth and

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.377
twenty-first century,
and deal with such global

00:05:23.377 --> 00:05:27.413
pandemics as HIV/AIDS,
malaria and tuberculosis,

00:05:27.413 --> 00:05:31.120
we will look quickly a little
further afield.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.649
It would be perverse to discuss
HIV/AIDS without paying

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:39.571
attention to Africa,
which is its place of origin,

00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:43.216
its epicenter,
and the place where the disease

00:05:43.216 --> 00:05:48.310
is causing almost unimaginable
burdens of suffering and loss.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.538
We're inescapably part of a
global world in which microbes

00:05:52.538 --> 00:05:56.766
refuse to recognize political
borders, and we have to take

00:05:56.766 --> 00:05:58.399
that into account.
 

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:02.783
So, that's the geography,
focusing on Europe and North

00:06:02.783 --> 00:06:07.500
America, but branching out for
the very modern part of the

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.410
course.
 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.730
Chronology: when,
what period do we cover?

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.456
Well, really we look at the
centuries from 1600 to the

00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:19.350
present.
 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.730
We'll start with everyone's
idea of a worst case scenario in

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.172
terms of epidemic disease;
and by that I mean bubonic

00:06:28.172 --> 00:06:28.899
plague.
 

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:33.923
And we'll end with the current
situation and the latest threats

00:06:33.923 --> 00:06:37.651
to have emerged,
like SARS, avian flu and swine

00:06:37.651 --> 00:06:38.300
flu.
 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.348
As a student,
I always felt disappointed when

00:06:41.348 --> 00:06:45.435
history classes on the modern
period didn't come right up to

00:06:45.435 --> 00:06:46.060
date.
 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:52.365
So I feel a motivation to bring
us up to the newest papers

00:06:52.365 --> 00:06:53.250
today.
 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.120
In fact, one of the goals of
the class is to help equip

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.846
ourselves with the critical
tools we need to confront

00:07:00.846 --> 00:07:04.072
today's events,
in a more informed and

00:07:04.072 --> 00:07:05.620
productive manner.
 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.353
Since I've mentioned influenza,
we'll certainly ask in

00:07:09.353 --> 00:07:11.672
passing--
and I hope some of you will

00:07:11.672 --> 00:07:14.528
answer the question--
why it is that the most

00:07:14.528 --> 00:07:18.975
threatening pandemic afflictions
of the twenty-first century seem

00:07:18.975 --> 00:07:21.060
to be respiratory diseases?
 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.980
Why is that?
 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.180
How did that come about?
 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.410
Then I want to talk with you
for a couple of minutes about

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.620
the diseases that we'll be
examining.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.589
I've told you so far the ones
we mostly won't be looking at.

00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:37.963
Well, first,
what are the criteria by which

00:07:37.963 --> 00:07:39.490
I've chosen them?
 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.858
First, I'm going to be looking
at epidemic diseases that had

00:07:43.858 --> 00:07:47.041
the greatest social,
scientific and cultural

00:07:47.041 --> 00:07:47.930
effects.
 

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.699
We'll call them high-impact
infectious diseases.

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:54.769
That's a first criterion,
their impact.

00:07:54.769 --> 00:07:58.788
Second, I'll be looking at
diseases that have had the most

00:07:58.788 --> 00:08:02.244
important role in the
development of public health

00:08:02.244 --> 00:08:04.430
strategies to contain them.
 

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:09.896
A major concern throughout the
course is the variety of efforts

00:08:09.896 --> 00:08:13.776
that societies have made to
prevent, contain,

00:08:13.776 --> 00:08:17.569
cure and eradicate infectious
diseases.

00:08:17.569 --> 00:08:22.483
Our course is not only about
disease, but also about public

00:08:22.483 --> 00:08:26.889
health, and so we'll give that a
privileged place;

00:08:26.889 --> 00:08:32.288
to that and to those diseases
that stimulated various styles

00:08:32.288 --> 00:08:36.678
of organized and effective
societal responses.

00:08:36.678 --> 00:08:41.335
A next criterion is that we're
going to look at those diseases

00:08:41.335 --> 00:08:45.686
that were the most feared
killers of each of the centuries

00:08:45.686 --> 00:08:47.058
that we study.
 

00:08:47.058 --> 00:08:51.888
We'll also want a varied diet,
in other words diversity,

00:08:51.888 --> 00:08:56.628
and to that end some of our
diseases will be bacterial,

00:08:56.628 --> 00:08:59.350
some viral, some parasitic.
 

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:03.369
Some will be transmitted
sexually, some through the air,

00:09:03.369 --> 00:09:07.243
others through food and water,
and some are carried by

00:09:07.243 --> 00:09:08.120
insects.
 

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.846
And by these criteria,
we'll focus in particular on

00:09:11.846 --> 00:09:15.701
bubonic plague,
on Asiatic cholera,

00:09:15.701 --> 00:09:20.155
smallpox, syphilis,
tuberculosis,

00:09:20.155 --> 00:09:24.668
polio, HIV/AIDS and yellow
fever,

00:09:24.668 --> 00:09:28.850
with influenza bringing us
right up to date.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:33.409
So, those are the diseases
we'll be concentrating on.

00:09:33.409 --> 00:09:35.049
Well how do we deal with them?
 

00:09:35.049 --> 00:09:36.710
What's our strategy?
 

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.399
What's our way forward?
 

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:43.375
And I want to stress that this
is not a biology course but a

00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:44.808
history course.
 

00:09:44.808 --> 00:09:49.139
Epidemic diseases are
biological events,

00:09:49.139 --> 00:09:52.908
and we'll need to have some
understanding of what they are,

00:09:52.908 --> 00:09:56.470
where they come from,
how they were transmitted,

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.649
how they affect the human body.
 

00:09:58.649 --> 00:10:02.725
It would be inconceivable to
study the history of medicine

00:10:02.725 --> 00:10:07.157
without coming to terms with the
medical and biological aspects

00:10:07.157 --> 00:10:08.230
of disease.
 

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:13.221
Indeed, one of our goals will
be to examine major changes in

00:10:13.221 --> 00:10:16.100
medical thinking and philosophy.
 

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.909
But the biology will be
throughout in the background,

00:10:19.909 --> 00:10:24.160
and the exams and the papers
will not test you specifically

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.580
on that aspect of the course.
 

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:32.158
Our concern will be with the
impact of disease on society,

00:10:32.158 --> 00:10:34.408
religion and culture.
 

00:10:34.408 --> 00:10:39.011
But we want to do a lot more
than examine a series of ghastly

00:10:39.011 --> 00:10:42.620
biological invaders;
although we will do that.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.830
And so the course will stress a
number of long-term themes.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.605
The first of those I've already
told you about,

00:10:49.605 --> 00:10:51.899
and that's public health
strategies.

00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:55.049
We'll look at vaccination as a
strategy;

00:10:55.049 --> 00:11:00.557
quarantine and sanitary cordons;
urban cleanups and sanitary

00:11:00.557 --> 00:11:05.009
movements;
sanatoria, as for tuberculosis;

00:11:05.009 --> 00:11:10.048
magic bullets like quinine,
penicillin, antibiotics.

00:11:10.048 --> 00:11:13.508
And we'll also look at an
unfortunate public health

00:11:13.508 --> 00:11:16.363
policy,
by which I mean concealment,

00:11:16.363 --> 00:11:18.990
to hide the presence of
disease,

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:23.174
as China did during SARS,
but following a long precedent

00:11:23.174 --> 00:11:27.740
in which other governments have
a history of adopting similar

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.977
policies;
and we'll be looking at that

00:11:30.977 --> 00:11:31.379
too.
 

00:11:31.379 --> 00:11:34.320
Then we'll be looking at
intellectual history.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.788
Epidemic diseases,
in other words,

00:11:36.788 --> 00:11:40.527
had a leading role in the
development of the modern

00:11:40.527 --> 00:11:45.365
biomedical paradigm of disease,
with the germ theory and such

00:11:45.365 --> 00:11:49.658
disciplines as tropical medicine
and infectious diseases.

00:11:49.658 --> 00:11:53.038
And I'll want to argue,
or at least will be testing the

00:11:53.038 --> 00:11:55.688
idea,
that perhaps medical ideas,

00:11:55.688 --> 00:11:59.668
one of their aspects is that
they're ideologies,

00:11:59.668 --> 00:12:01.960
held not only for scientific
reasons,

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.985
although that's true,
but also because of the kinds

00:12:05.985 --> 00:12:10.226
of societies they promote,
or the power they convey to

00:12:10.226 --> 00:12:13.899
nations or strategically placed
elites within them.

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:16.840
That will be a question we'll
be examining.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.832
Then we'll be looking at
ethical issues:

00:12:19.832 --> 00:12:23.440
What are the ethics of human
experimentation?

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.179
And we'll be looking at some
horrific failures in ethical

00:12:28.179 --> 00:12:32.750
standards, and in particular
we'll examine the Tuskegee

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.360
Syphilis Study.
 

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.909
We'll also be looking and
thinking about diseases as a

00:12:38.909 --> 00:12:43.547
tool for the historian:
as a means of casting revealing

00:12:43.547 --> 00:12:47.240
light on how societies are
constructed;

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.330
on the relations of human
beings to one another;

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:54.740
on the moral priorities of
statesmen and religious leaders;

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.330
on the relationship of human
beings with their environment,

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.644
by which I mean both the
natural environment and the

00:13:01.644 --> 00:13:05.311
built environment,
the cities in particular in

00:13:05.311 --> 00:13:06.759
which they live.
 

00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:11.259
Responses to epidemic diseases
will be important to us.

00:13:11.259 --> 00:13:12.970
How did people respond?
 

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.913
And we'll be looking at
stigmatization,

00:13:15.913 --> 00:13:21.460
witch-hunting and scapegoating;
at flight and mass hysteria;

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:27.926
at upsurges in religiosity;
at changes in art and in

00:13:27.926 --> 00:13:29.690
philosophy.
 

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:35.140
The course will also try to
provide some understanding of a

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:40.779
number of major concepts and
terminology in public health.

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:44.337
By the end of the class,
you should be fluent in using

00:13:44.337 --> 00:13:47.897
words like etiology,
case fatality rate,

00:13:47.897 --> 00:13:50.836
nosology;
and you should know the

00:13:50.836 --> 00:13:55.211
difference between incidence and
prevalence, between an epidemic

00:13:55.211 --> 00:13:57.849
and a pandemic,
between inoculation and

00:13:57.849 --> 00:13:59.029
vaccination.
 

00:13:59.029 --> 00:14:02.177
And then another theme will be
an assessment,

00:14:02.177 --> 00:14:05.971
as I said, of where we stand
today in the twenty-first

00:14:05.971 --> 00:14:06.830
century.
 

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:11.120
What have we learned as a
society from the experience of

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.866
the past four centuries of
recurring and dreadful

00:14:14.866 --> 00:14:15.960
epidemics?
 

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:20.984
In 1969, the U.S. Surgeon
General had a premature surge of

00:14:20.984 --> 00:14:25.918
optimism in the age of
antibiotics and he declared,

00:14:25.918 --> 00:14:29.298
as he put it,
"We've turned the page on

00:14:29.298 --> 00:14:31.418
infectious disease."
 

00:14:31.418 --> 00:14:34.844
And medical schools and the
public health community taught

00:14:34.844 --> 00:14:38.327
that it would be possible to
eradicate one epidemic disease

00:14:38.327 --> 00:14:42.756
after another,
like smallpox or polio as

00:14:42.756 --> 00:14:43.808
models.
 

00:14:43.808 --> 00:14:48.509
But our Surgeon General turned
out to be spectacularly wrong.

00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:52.851
Today, in 2010,
infectious diseases are the

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:56.779
number one cause of death
worldwide.

00:14:56.779 --> 00:15:01.011
It's also clear that it will be
impossible to write the history

00:15:01.011 --> 00:15:04.288
of the twentieth and
twenty-first century without

00:15:04.288 --> 00:15:07.990
giving a central place,
at the very least,

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:12.470
to HIV/AIDS,
and to other pandemics as well.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.519
Furthermore,
we know too that there's a

00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:18.889
whole host of emerging diseases:
Ebola,

00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:21.518
Lassa fever,
West Nile virus,

00:15:21.518 --> 00:15:24.570
SARS,
avian flu, AIDS and,

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.100
of course, swine flu.
 

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:31.150
And familiar diseases have
re-emerged in resistant and

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:35.517
threatening manners,
such as drug resistant

00:15:35.517 --> 00:15:42.070
tuberculosis or malaria,
and other diseases as well.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:47.035
So, the threat has been made
clear in dress rehearsals we've

00:15:47.035 --> 00:15:50.655
had in our new century:
SARS, avian flu and,

00:15:50.655 --> 00:15:52.928
as we speak,
swine flu.

00:15:52.928 --> 00:15:57.345
And indeed, the nature of
modern society may make us more

00:15:57.345 --> 00:16:01.129
vulnerable, rather than less,
to such threats.

00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:04.797
We'll want to think about some
of the factors that may make

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:07.639
that true,
such as a high and ever-growing

00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:11.769
world population density,
as we rapidly reach a figure of

00:16:11.769 --> 00:16:15.250
seven-billion people,
before very long;

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:18.957
rapid movements of population
by rail, road,

00:16:18.957 --> 00:16:22.580
cruise ship,
but above all the airplane;

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.716
rapid and chaotic urbanization,
with the appearance of ever

00:16:26.716 --> 00:16:29.999
more mega cities,
with populations in excess of

00:16:29.999 --> 00:16:33.388
ten-million people;
places like Tokyo,

00:16:33.388 --> 00:16:35.815
Mexico City,
Lagos, Delhi,

00:16:35.815 --> 00:16:39.894
Mumbai, New York,
Jakarta, Buenos Aires and

00:16:39.894 --> 00:16:41.058
others.
 

00:16:41.058 --> 00:16:44.730
These, many of them,
conjure up images of

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:47.994
overcrowding,
of poverty, substandard

00:16:47.994 --> 00:16:51.350
housing, inadequate access to
healthcare,

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.960
extensive illiteracy,
open sewers.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.144
Then there's the perennial
problem of warfare,

00:16:58.144 --> 00:17:02.322
and the terrible dislocations
that wars leave in their wake:

00:17:02.322 --> 00:17:05.259
Displaced people;
refugee camps;

00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:09.470
the collapse of health systems
and sanitation;

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:14.380
extensive poverty and widening
social inequalities;

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:18.170
climatic change and
environmental devastation;

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:22.858
and the failure to provide such
basics as safe and adequate

00:17:22.858 --> 00:17:26.902
water supplies for untold
millions of people in the

00:17:26.902 --> 00:17:28.598
developing world.
 

00:17:28.598 --> 00:17:32.375
Unfortunately,
not one of those factors seems

00:17:32.375 --> 00:17:37.096
likely to abate in the near
future, and some of them are

00:17:37.096 --> 00:17:40.098
gathering momentum as we speak.
 

00:17:40.098 --> 00:17:42.848
Well, it's possible,
and reasonable even,

00:17:42.848 --> 00:17:47.913
to ask whether it is true that
the way we handle epidemic

00:17:47.913 --> 00:17:52.980
diseases will be crucial to our
survival as a society.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.750
In addition,
I would argue,

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.088
that it's important to examine
these diseases,

00:17:58.088 --> 00:18:00.190
the ones that have been most
prevalent,

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:05.048
as they hold up a mirror to
ourselves.

00:18:05.048 --> 00:18:09.961
I would argue that every
disease, and epidemic disease in

00:18:09.961 --> 00:18:12.991
particular--
these are not random

00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:17.948
events--that every society has
its own specific types of

00:18:17.948 --> 00:18:21.068
affliction,
and to study them is to learn

00:18:21.068 --> 00:18:25.194
about its living conditions,
its moral priorities and

00:18:25.194 --> 00:18:26.630
relationships.
 

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:30.230
For all of these reasons we
could argue that epidemic

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.068
diseases are great bearers of
meaning,

00:18:33.068 --> 00:18:37.300
and our job is to decipher the
meaning embedded in them as

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:41.958
contemporaries experienced them,
and to understand them

00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:43.548
retrospectively.
 

00:18:43.548 --> 00:18:47.442
Well, then, that brings us to
our first couple of weeks,

00:18:47.442 --> 00:18:49.068
and where we go next.
 

00:18:49.068 --> 00:18:54.500
On Wednesday we'll roll up our
sleeves and get down to work,

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.404
looking at the meanings that
Europeans gave to epidemic

00:18:58.404 --> 00:19:02.814
diseases when they first struck
the continent and as they were

00:19:02.814 --> 00:19:07.078
seen through the lens of the
reigning medical doctrine;

00:19:07.078 --> 00:19:11.580
that is, the humoralism
philosophy developed by

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.930
Hippocrates and Galen.
 

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:17.250
At the time of plague in the
seventeenth century,

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:22.164
humoralism, which was the first
embodiment of what we might call

00:19:22.164 --> 00:19:26.122
scientific medicine,
was still the dominant medical

00:19:26.122 --> 00:19:30.367
paradigm for disease,
as it had been for nearly two

00:19:30.367 --> 00:19:31.348
millennia.
 

00:19:31.348 --> 00:19:34.772
And so our first task will be
to examine a topic in

00:19:34.772 --> 00:19:37.170
intellectual history of
medicine;

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.093
a topic that will help us to
understand how the first

00:19:40.093 --> 00:19:42.680
epidemic disease that we're
going to study,

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.015
bubonic plague,
was understood,

00:19:45.015 --> 00:19:48.130
how it was experienced by
physicians,

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:51.618
statesmen and educated laymen.
 

00:19:51.618 --> 00:19:56.132
We'll also be in a position
then to understand that epidemic

00:19:56.132 --> 00:20:00.108
diseases fundamentally challenge
humeral notions,

00:20:00.108 --> 00:20:04.604
and help to lead to a major
intellectual paradigm shift that

00:20:04.604 --> 00:20:07.500
we'll discuss later in the
semester.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.426
So, our course then will begin
with the legacy of two of the

00:20:11.426 --> 00:20:14.288
most influential doctors who
ever lived,

00:20:14.288 --> 00:20:17.694
both Greeks:
Hippocrates from the fifth

00:20:17.694 --> 00:20:21.513
century B.C.,
and Galen from the second

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:24.088
century of the Common Era.
 

00:20:24.088 --> 00:20:27.911
Looking at their philosophy of
medicine will give us a

00:20:27.911 --> 00:20:32.238
framework to understand the ways
in which the experience of a

00:20:32.238 --> 00:20:34.690
plague was a tremendous shock.
 

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:40.140
Most obviously it was a shock
in terms of death and suffering,

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:45.021
but it was also a shock because
it undermined the foundations of

00:20:45.021 --> 00:20:49.130
medical and intellectual
understandings of disease.

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:53.708
The passage of bubonic plague
through European society was not

00:20:53.708 --> 00:20:56.710
only a biological and material
event,

00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:02.192
but also a major intellectual,
religious and psychological

00:21:02.192 --> 00:21:02.769
one.
 

00:21:02.769 --> 00:21:07.371
Having done that,
next week what we'll do is turn

00:21:07.371 --> 00:21:09.960
to bubonic plague itself.
 

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:14.997
Now, the plague is everyone's
candidate for the worst-case

00:21:14.997 --> 00:21:15.970
scenario.
 

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:19.690
A plague is synonymous with
terror.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:24.030
One reason was that it was an
extraordinarily rapid and

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:27.861
excruciating killer,
with symptoms that were

00:21:27.861 --> 00:21:32.429
dehumanizing and agonizing,
with no effective therapy,

00:21:32.429 --> 00:21:36.567
and a kill rate that ensured
that the majority of its

00:21:36.567 --> 00:21:38.318
sufferers perished.
 

00:21:38.318 --> 00:21:41.123
It was also readily
transmissible,

00:21:41.123 --> 00:21:45.796
so that it seemed poised at
various times to destroy the

00:21:45.796 --> 00:21:48.430
whole population of Europe.
 

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:52.450
And it did kill an enormous
proportion of the population;

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.950
up to half in major European
cities.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:22:00.714
So, here was the origin of a
terrifying cliche about plague:

00:22:00.714 --> 00:22:05.480
that it struck down so many
that there weren't enough people

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.579
left to bury the dead.
 

00:22:07.579 --> 00:22:09.430
So, what will we do next week?
 

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:14.256
Well we'll look at symptoms of
plague, its horrifying effects

00:22:14.256 --> 00:22:16.750
on the individual human body.
 

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:20.614
We'll look at its devastating
impact on society,

00:22:20.614 --> 00:22:25.135
and at the responses of whole
populations to the time of

00:22:25.135 --> 00:22:28.240
plague: mass flight;
scapegoating;

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.650
social disorder;
upsurges in religion;

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:36.808
new cults of saints;
new iconographies in the arts.

00:22:36.808 --> 00:22:38.890
But there's more to it than
that.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:43.634
The plague led also to the
first successful strategies of

00:22:43.634 --> 00:22:46.769
public health to combat
pestilence;

00:22:46.769 --> 00:22:51.431
strategies that were often
draconian, in direct proportion

00:22:51.431 --> 00:22:54.130
to the magnitude of the threat.
 

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:57.261
These strategies included,
as we'll see,

00:22:57.261 --> 00:23:00.876
boards of health,
with almost unlimited powers

00:23:00.876 --> 00:23:03.848
during the emergency:
quarantine;

00:23:03.848 --> 00:23:08.415
military lines and naval
blockades to isolate cities,

00:23:08.415 --> 00:23:13.438
or even whole countries;
and we'll see pest houses to

00:23:13.438 --> 00:23:17.348
confine and isolate the sick and
dying.

00:23:17.348 --> 00:23:21.098
As a guide to our experience we
have this book,

00:23:21.098 --> 00:23:24.930
which is Daniel Defoe's
Journal of the Plague

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:27.405
Year;
which is the first reading

00:23:27.405 --> 00:23:28.058
assignment.
 

00:23:28.058 --> 00:23:32.001
And I want to talk about it for
a minute, because some of you

00:23:32.001 --> 00:23:34.960
may want to start reading it
straight away.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.247
I'm not too good as a salesman,
but I do think it's appropriate

00:23:39.247 --> 00:23:41.529
to make a plug for great books.
 

00:23:41.529 --> 00:23:44.882
And in this case,
of Defoe, I want to introduce

00:23:44.882 --> 00:23:49.037
one of the classics of a whole
genre of what you'll become

00:23:49.037 --> 00:23:51.880
familiar with as plague
literature.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:56.056
Defoe's masterpiece is a
powerful description by a

00:23:56.056 --> 00:23:59.843
contemporary--
in fact a survivor--of the most

00:23:59.843 --> 00:24:04.221
dreadful outbreak of bubonic
plague in the history of the

00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:09.357
British Isles;
the catastrophic visitation of

00:24:09.357 --> 00:24:10.118
1665.
 

00:24:10.118 --> 00:24:14.352
Plague had returned in
successive waves in European

00:24:14.352 --> 00:24:18.670
history, ever since the first
visitation of 1347.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:22.092
But one of the terrible
features about it is that over

00:24:22.092 --> 00:24:24.740
the centuries it didn't become
milder,

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:28.079
and some of its last
visitations were the most

00:24:28.079 --> 00:24:33.520
violent and horrendous of all,
including the epidemic that

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.180
ravaged London in 1665.
 

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:42.404
Now, a possible issue for some
may be overcoming the barrier of

00:24:42.404 --> 00:24:43.509
language.
 

00:24:43.509 --> 00:24:45.848
So I want to throw out a
challenge.

00:24:45.848 --> 00:24:50.279
The book, I will admit,
can start out a bit slowly for

00:24:50.279 --> 00:24:51.450
some of you.
 

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:54.942
So I want you to think not so
much at the outset,

00:24:54.942 --> 00:24:58.363
as you open it up,
as to whether you immediately

00:24:58.363 --> 00:25:01.318
enjoy it;
although I'm hoping that you

00:25:01.318 --> 00:25:01.750
will.
 

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:06.190
But I want you to think instead
about why it's so important.

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:10.192
I'd like you to think about
what you can learn from being in

00:25:10.192 --> 00:25:14.400
the company of someone who had
the experience of living through

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.588
the worst of all public health
calamities,

00:25:17.588 --> 00:25:22.575
and to ask yourselves why this
book has been read avidly for

00:25:22.575 --> 00:25:24.348
four hundred years.
 

00:25:24.348 --> 00:25:28.897
It may interest you also to
know that during the SARS

00:25:28.897 --> 00:25:33.578
outbreak in Toronto in 2003,
thousands of people were

00:25:33.578 --> 00:25:38.018
quarantined in their homes,
and at the top of their list of

00:25:38.018 --> 00:25:42.002
books that they read to pass the
time and make sense of their

00:25:42.002 --> 00:25:43.988
experience,
was this one:

00:25:43.988 --> 00:25:47.259
Defoe's Journal of the
Plague Year.

00:25:47.259 --> 00:25:50.381
Well, history,
after all, is in part about

00:25:50.381 --> 00:25:53.730
sharing a common culture and
common memories,

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:58.068
and reading this book then is
certainly part of that.

00:25:58.068 --> 00:26:02.116
And if you think of it in those
ways, with those questions in

00:26:02.116 --> 00:26:05.961
mind, I think--and this is my
secret agenda--you'll really

00:26:05.961 --> 00:26:06.838
enjoy it.
 

00:26:06.838 --> 00:26:11.624
I also think that you'll find
that it's a wonderful account of

00:26:11.624 --> 00:26:15.702
how a society responded to one
of the greatest of all

00:26:15.702 --> 00:26:16.880
challenges.
 

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.382
Defoe recounts the flight of
the king and other authorities

00:26:21.382 --> 00:26:24.410
from London, in fear for their
lives.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:27.759
He tells us about religious
enthusiasm;

00:26:27.759 --> 00:26:31.682
about how people understood the
catastrophe they were

00:26:31.682 --> 00:26:34.548
experiencing,
what it meant to them.

00:26:34.548 --> 00:26:39.776
He tells us about the hunt that
was on for witches and

00:26:39.776 --> 00:26:42.338
scapegoats and culprits.
 

00:26:42.338 --> 00:26:45.259
He talks about plague-induced
crime;

00:26:45.259 --> 00:26:49.660
the helplessness of physicians;
about popular culture;

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:54.009
and desperate attempts of
people to save themselves;

00:26:54.009 --> 00:26:58.346
and then about the extreme
measures of shutting people up

00:26:58.346 --> 00:27:02.990
in their homes by government
authorities, or taking them away

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:05.160
by force to pest houses.
 

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:10.284
And since this is a comparative
course, I'll hope that you'll

00:27:10.284 --> 00:27:14.980
begin to reflect on how far
we've changed and progressed

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:17.970
from the time that Defoe wrote.
 

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:20.548
And I'll draw your attention,
for example,

00:27:20.548 --> 00:27:24.618
to the early years of the
HIV/AIDS epidemic,

00:27:24.618 --> 00:27:29.616
and we'll think together about
some possibly very troubling

00:27:29.616 --> 00:27:30.910
similarities.
 

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:34.515
In fact, one of the constants
in the centuries since the

00:27:34.515 --> 00:27:36.618
plague itself,
in the West,

00:27:36.618 --> 00:27:41.646
has been a tendency in times of
public health crises to resort

00:27:41.646 --> 00:27:44.779
to plague measures of
self-defense.

00:27:44.779 --> 00:27:47.671
We'll see that very
dramatically in the nineteenth

00:27:47.671 --> 00:27:49.919
century,
in the time of cholera,

00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:53.952
when the desperate attempt was
made to stop Asiatic cholera

00:27:53.952 --> 00:27:57.358
with measures that had worked
against plague,

00:27:57.358 --> 00:28:01.558
but turned out to be entirely
counter-productive.

00:28:01.558 --> 00:28:05.775
And we'll see it again in the
early years of the AIDS

00:28:05.775 --> 00:28:10.640
pandemic, and in that case too
with haunting consequences.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:15.472
So, now you know where we'll
begin: on Wednesday with medical

00:28:15.472 --> 00:28:18.589
science,
in its first but long-lasting

00:28:18.589 --> 00:28:21.857
embodiment,
and the way that Europeans

00:28:21.857 --> 00:28:26.211
experienced plague,
through the lens of humoral

00:28:26.211 --> 00:28:26.960
theory.
 

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.759
And then next week we'll deal
with the most devastating

00:28:30.759 --> 00:28:34.630
epidemic to strike the Western
world, bubonic plague;

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:38.969
and in Daniel Defoe you have a
really good guide to accompany

00:28:38.969 --> 00:28:40.559
you on your journey.
 

00:28:40.559 --> 00:28:42.339
So, I'll see you next time.
 

00:28:42.339 --> 00:28:48.000

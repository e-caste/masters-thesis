00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.480
Prof: Okay, let's start.
 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.973
I'm going to do some leftover
stuff from circuits,

00:00:07.973 --> 00:00:11.550
because I didn't finish it last
time.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.068
So I want you to remember the
following things about a

00:00:17.068 --> 00:00:18.110
circuit.
 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.300
I'm always thinking of
different ways to explain it.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.640
So the things we normally learn
is,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.270
if you've got some battery
here, some number of volts,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.974
let's give it the symbol
E, and you have a

00:00:31.974 --> 00:00:36.057
resistor,
we just say there's a 1.5 volt

00:00:36.057 --> 00:00:37.320
difference.
 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.780
So you can say this is 0 this
is 1.5.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.130
Current goes around and comes
back.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.447
And we say the work is done,
because the battery is somehow

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:49.220
making the current go around.
 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.696
But we look under the hood and
found it's somewhat more

00:00:52.696 --> 00:00:53.340
complex.
 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.250
It is not done entirely with
the electrostatic force.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.405
The electrostatic force is due
to these charges here,

00:01:02.405 --> 00:01:06.402
sitting on the plate,
but they cannot do work for a

00:01:06.402 --> 00:01:09.360
charge that goes round and
round.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.421
Because if you go round in a
full loop in an electrostatic

00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:14.840
field, the net work done by the
field is 0.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.531
That's because the net work
done is the integral of the

00:01:17.531 --> 00:01:19.971
electrostatic field and because
it's conservative,

00:01:19.971 --> 00:01:20.819
you'll get 0.
 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:23.658
Yet when charges go round and
round the circuit,

00:01:23.658 --> 00:01:27.040
they are doing some work,
because the resistor is heating

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.489
up, delivering heat.
 

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:32.569
And the hidden secret of course
is not the electrostatic force,

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:36.519
but another force inside the
battery that's doing the job.

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:40.010
So I gave an analogy which I
think is worth repeating.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:47.110
So here is a ski slope and you
start here and you come down.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.312
Let's imagine on the way down
you bump into a lot of trees,

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:56.260
that you pretty much come down
at 0 speed.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.968
Then you stagger back to the
foot of this ski lift.

00:02:00.968 --> 00:02:04.140
Now that's the end of your
skiing.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.090
There's nothing else,
because gravity is not going to

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.813
help you anymore,
because gravity is not going to

00:02:09.813 --> 00:02:11.800
help you go from here to there.
 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.080
So it's not obviously run by
just gravity.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.870
That's when you have the ski
lift, which I'm going to portray

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.474
as a vertical thing,
where you've got a lot of

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:24.159
chairs, so you can sit on one of
them and you can ride to the

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:24.590
top.
 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.280
So that ski lift exerts a force.
 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.020
Gravity, which is acting down
here,

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.960
is also acting down here,
and the ski lift,

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.140
F_ski and
F_gravity, ski

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.030
lift cancels gravity here and
takes you to the top.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.126
So if you define the analog of
an emf, there is no

00:02:43.126 --> 00:02:44.710
"electro"
about this one.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.280
Let's just call it emf.
 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.220
As the integral of the forces
acting on this one skier,

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.733
as he or she goes around the
loop, you can write that as the

00:02:57.733 --> 00:03:03.694
force due to gravity â‹…
dr and the force due to the

00:03:03.694 --> 00:03:08.949
lift--
or what did I call it?

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.129
Hey guys, you know what this
was called?

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.060
Student:  Ski.
 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.930
Prof: Ski.
 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.280
Okay, ski dot dr.
 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.628
this is no good.
 

00:03:19.628 --> 00:03:22.985
Gravity does something to you
when you come down and takes it

00:03:22.985 --> 00:03:24.438
all back when you go up.
 

00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:28.437
This guy, the force inside the
ski, has a non-zero line

00:03:28.437 --> 00:03:32.508
integral, because it's a
non-zero force only in here.

00:03:32.508 --> 00:03:36.744
The line integral's basically
the ski force times the

00:03:36.744 --> 00:03:37.639
distance.
 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.419
The ski force is just
mg, the magnitude.

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.128
That times the distance is
mgh.

00:03:42.128 --> 00:03:45.263
That's why you can say this
point is a potential mgh

00:03:45.263 --> 00:03:46.560
that lifts up to that.
 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.397
But inside this region,
gravity is pointing down and

00:03:49.397 --> 00:03:52.960
the machine takes you against
gravity and puts you on the top.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.620
And that's the non-conservative
force that does the work.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.460
So the main point was,
electrostatics is conservative,

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.538
and yet when a charge goes
around and around the loop,

00:04:03.538 --> 00:04:07.030
the line integral of the total
force is not 0,

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.508
so it's not entirely driven by
electrostatics,

00:04:09.508 --> 00:04:11.500
but electrostatic forces are
important.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.293
Just like gravity's important
here, because gravity's what

00:04:15.293 --> 00:04:17.089
helps you come down here.
 

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:22.005
The ski lift is all hidden
inside, and then it takes you

00:04:22.005 --> 00:04:22.899
back up.
 

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:25.286
So I'm going to draw the
circuit in a way that really

00:04:25.286 --> 00:04:27.028
indicates the gravitational
analogy.

00:04:27.028 --> 00:04:29.269
So I'm going to draw it not
this way but this way.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:33.185
Here's the top plate and here's
the bottom plate and you may

00:04:33.185 --> 00:04:36.970
directly visualize the height
here to be the potential.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.920
Then there is a wire that has
no resistance.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.290
It's going to be flat.
 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.557
Potential doesn't have to be up
or down for current to flow down

00:04:44.557 --> 00:04:44.920
this.
 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.050
Then here is a resistor.
 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.379
Then there's another little
wire, which is pretty much flat

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:53.319
and joins at the bottom.
 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:57.028
There are charges piled up
here, there are charged piled up

00:04:57.028 --> 00:04:58.759
here,
and they will produce an

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.350
electrostatic field that will do
something there,

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.588
but inside, they're bad.
 

00:05:03.588 --> 00:05:08.240
Electrostatic field goes down
here.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.709
So if this is the whole story,
you cannot do anything,

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:12.560
because maybe if you charged it
once,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.850
it will go round and come back
here and it's stuck,

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.629
because it cannot go up.
 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:20.396
That's when the tiny little
hands of the chemical forces

00:05:20.396 --> 00:05:23.959
will come and drag the charge,
against this field.

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:27.939
That's the F_chemical
force.

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:31.680
And it's the line integral of
the chemical force around a

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.819
closed loop that's called emf.
 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:38.028
If you write the chemical force
per unit charge,

00:05:38.028 --> 00:05:43.399
integrate over a closed loop,
that's what we call the emf.

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:44.889
But that's very easily computed.
 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.425
That's what I didn't realize,
a much easier way to do the

00:05:47.425 --> 00:05:48.060
computation.
 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.839
This thing is just a product of
that force times the distance,

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:54.781
but in magnitude,
that force precisely cancels

00:05:54.781 --> 00:05:58.603
the downward electric force,
just like the lift cancels the

00:05:58.603 --> 00:05:59.680
force of gravity.
 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.274
So the line integral in
magnitude is just the electric

00:06:04.274 --> 00:06:08.348
field times the distance between
the two plates,

00:06:08.348 --> 00:06:11.209
and that is just the voltage.
 

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:14.673
Therefore the voltage
difference between this point

00:06:14.673 --> 00:06:16.959
and this point will be the emf.
 

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:18.939
Now if you don't want to know
the whole details,

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:20.910
you can go back to drawing
pictures this way,

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.028
and if you have a circuit like
this,

00:06:23.028 --> 00:06:26.545
and maybe there's a switch
here, you can be assured that

00:06:26.545 --> 00:06:28.910
between this point and this
point,

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.910
if you go around and measure
the voltage difference,

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.579
that will be the emf of the
battery.

00:06:33.579 --> 00:06:35.920
That's all you really need to
know.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.052
The way it comes out is that
this battery is like a pump that

00:06:39.052 --> 00:06:42.079
lifts you up by an electrical
height equal to 1.5 volts.

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:45.160
The emf is literally the
voltage difference.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.490
Yes?
 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.596
Student:  What's the
symbol under

00:06:48.596 --> 00:06:50.540
F_c in the
first?

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.000
Prof: Charge.
 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.620
Because electric field is the
force per unit charge.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.923
We should take whatever force
there is and write it as a force

00:07:00.923 --> 00:07:02.490
per unit charge.
 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.350
All right, so I wanted to do
some simple problems.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.663
This stuff you've done already
in high school,

00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:14.565
but I want to go over it in
view of everything we have

00:07:14.565 --> 00:07:15.449
learned.
 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:18.029
So here's the simplest circuit
in the world.

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:20.189
You have an emf.
 

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:24.879
There is a resistor and it
comes right back.

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:27.639
You want to know what current
is flowing in the circuit.

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:30.154
So the logic,
there are two equations you

00:07:30.154 --> 00:07:30.910
write now.
 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.290
One equation is,
if you start at any point on

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.899
the circuit and you go around a
path and you come back to the

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:41.810
same point,
the change in voltage should be

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.959
zero,
because voltage is like height.

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:46.740
You can go anywhere you want
and you can come back,

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.519
then the change in height
should add up to zero.

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:52.382
If you want,
sum of all the change in

00:07:52.382 --> 00:07:56.040
voltage should be zero around a
closed loop.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.930
Second thing is,
current is conserved.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.430
These are the only equations
you need.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.790
Current doesn't disappear.
 

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.040
It's uniform here.
 

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.024
So current I comes here,
drops through the resistor and

00:08:09.024 --> 00:08:11.240
comes out of the other side.
 

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.439
So I'm going to write the
following equation.

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:16.670
I'm going to start at this
point and keep track of all the

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:17.860
changes in voltage.
 

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.629
First when I go around this
battery, I told you many times,

00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:24.620
the change in voltage will be
just E.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.500
When I come here,
current flows downhill.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.625
I know the voltage drop here is
RI, but if I follow it,

00:08:31.625 --> 00:08:33.519
I'm dropping in potential.
 

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:35.548
It's a skier;
it's going downhill.

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:38.320
It's a ski lift where it's
going up.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.428
And then you come back here to
where you started,

00:08:42.428 --> 00:08:44.909
the total change must be 0.
 

00:08:44.909 --> 00:08:46.320
Now this is pretty trivial.
 

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.380
You probably wrote this without
any further thought,

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:56.740
but we then just say we get
from that E = IR.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.153
Then we're going to do a more
complicated problem,

00:09:01.153 --> 00:09:03.765
one resistor,
second resistor,

00:09:03.765 --> 00:09:08.000
R_1,
R_2.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.761
Again, if you apply an emf
here, that current is going to

00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:14.918
go through this guy and go
through that guy,

00:09:14.918 --> 00:09:17.519
and it's the same current
because it has nowhere to go.

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:20.705
So the equation now will be
E, which is increased

00:09:20.705 --> 00:09:21.980
when you go up here.
 

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.775
Then you drop
R_1 times

00:09:24.775 --> 00:09:29.008
I R_2
times I and that equals

00:09:29.008 --> 00:09:30.476
0,
so current is

00:09:30.476 --> 00:09:33.970
E/(R_1
R_2).

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:37.587
That means if you put two
resistors in series,

00:09:37.587 --> 00:09:41.850
it's equal to a single resistor
equal to their sum.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.485
In other words,
if these two were enclosed in a

00:09:44.485 --> 00:09:46.404
black box,
you didn't know what's inside,

00:09:46.404 --> 00:09:48.399
you've got two leads coming out
and someone says,

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:51.048
"Hey, what's inside the
black box?

00:09:51.048 --> 00:09:52.690
What's the resistor
inside?"

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.803
you will apply voltage,
you will measure the current

00:09:56.803 --> 00:10:00.028
and that ratio you will call
R.

00:10:00.028 --> 00:10:03.562
E/I = R,
but here, you can see

00:10:03.562 --> 00:10:06.034
E/I =
R_1

00:10:06.034 --> 00:10:07.590
R_2.
 

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.855
So that's the value you will
ascribe to the two guys in

00:10:10.855 --> 00:10:11.399
series.
 

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:14.429
Now if you put them in
parallel--I think again I'm

00:10:14.429 --> 00:10:17.937
repeating it,
but maybe it's harmless right

00:10:17.937 --> 00:10:22.850
now--so here is one resistor,
here's the second resistor.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:29.950
This is R_1,
this is R_2.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.428
This is some E.
 

00:10:33.428 --> 00:10:35.725
If you put this inside a black
box and someone says,

00:10:35.725 --> 00:10:37.433
"Hey, tell me what's
inside,"

00:10:37.433 --> 00:10:38.288
you don't know.
 

00:10:38.288 --> 00:10:41.024
It may not be this,
but there'll be some effective

00:10:41.024 --> 00:10:41.750
resistance.
 

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:45.421
And we compute that by saying
let a current I leave this

00:10:45.421 --> 00:10:48.224
battery here,
do whatever it wants and come

00:10:48.224 --> 00:10:49.960
out of the other side.
 

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.759
Inside the box,
this current will split into an

00:10:52.759 --> 00:10:54.158
I_1.
 

00:10:54.158 --> 00:10:55.279
I can call it
I_2,

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:57.649
but I'm just going to call it
I - I_1,

00:10:57.649 --> 00:11:04.879
because that's what
I_2 should be.

00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:10.440
And it comes out of this side.
 

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:17.250
So let me say the total current
= I_1--I

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.169
changed my mind,
guys.

00:11:20.169 --> 00:11:21.058
Sorry.
 

00:11:21.058 --> 00:11:22.678
Let me call this
I_2.

00:11:22.678 --> 00:11:26.157
The total current is
I_1

00:11:26.157 --> 00:11:28.090
I_2.
 

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:31.576
But I_1 is
V/R_1 because

00:11:31.576 --> 00:11:34.940
the voltage V is acting
across these two ends.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.250
The voltage V is also
acting across those two ends,

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.370
so it will be
V/R_2,

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.572
and that's going to be equal to
V divided by whatever the

00:11:43.572 --> 00:11:47.038
resistance inside the box is,
by definition.

00:11:47.038 --> 00:11:50.543
If you compare the two,
you find 1/R is

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:54.279
1/R_1
1/R_2.

00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:57.077
I mention this just to tell you
that it comes from current

00:11:57.077 --> 00:11:58.797
conservation,
where I used I,

00:11:58.797 --> 00:12:00.860
is I_1
I_2.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.729
We might as well deal with the
two others, one other circuit

00:12:04.729 --> 00:12:06.960
element, which is the capacitor.
 

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:14.210
So suppose someone takes two
capacitors.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:15.620
This guy is
C_1,

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.210
this guy is
C_2,

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:21.356
puts them in a black box and
says, "Tell me what's

00:12:21.356 --> 00:12:22.509
inside."
 

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:28.875
So you will take your battery,
apply voltage E,

00:12:28.875 --> 00:12:34.399
then see how much charge leaves
the battery.

00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:39.177
Then the capacitance will be
the charge that leaves the

00:12:39.177 --> 00:12:43.070
battery divided by the emf or
the voltage.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:45.947
If a charge comes from here,
a charge Q_1

00:12:45.947 --> 00:12:48.524
will go from there and
-Q_1 will go

00:12:48.524 --> 00:12:49.029
there.
 

00:12:49.029 --> 00:12:52.621
 Q_2 will go
there and -Q_2

00:12:52.621 --> 00:12:53.580
will go there.
 

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:59.607
So the Q that's going in
will be Q_1

00:12:59.607 --> 00:13:02.019
Q_2...
 

00:13:02.019 --> 00:13:04.149
over E.
 

00:13:04.149 --> 00:13:09.629
But Q_1 = C_1
times E.

00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:11.544
Q_2 =
C_2 times

00:13:11.544 --> 00:13:12.058
E.
 

00:13:12.058 --> 00:13:17.496
So divided by E, you'll
get C_1 

00:13:17.496 --> 00:13:19.629
C_2.
 

00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:23.705
This will tell you that the two
capacitors in parallel will act

00:13:23.705 --> 00:13:27.649
like a single capacitor whose
value is the sum of the two.

00:13:27.649 --> 00:13:34.118
That's actually very easy to
understand because here's one

00:13:34.118 --> 00:13:35.480
capacitor.
 

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.450
Here's another guy.
 

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.019
Let me just glue those plates
together.

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:43.009
It doesn't matter because they
are the same voltage.

00:13:43.009 --> 00:13:44.340
And you don't need these two
wires.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.860
You can just dump that and dump
that.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.340
Current can just come in this
way.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.841
You've got a single capacitor
with the area equal to the sum

00:13:50.841 --> 00:13:51.970
of the two areas.
 

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.027
Capacitance was
Îµ_0

00:13:54.027 --> 00:13:55.168
A/d.
 

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:59.130
They have the same d,
but the areas add up so

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.840
capacitances add up.
 

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.629
And the final thing which I
don't want to do,

00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:05.519
because I don't want to move
onto more interesting things,

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:08.769
is when you put two capacitors
in series,

00:14:08.769 --> 00:14:11.807
what happens is,
you can take it as a homework

00:14:11.807 --> 00:14:13.729
problem,
that if you put a charge

00:14:13.729 --> 00:14:16.384
Q on this guy,
and a -Q comes out of

00:14:16.384 --> 00:14:19.344
the other terminal,
these two guys have no choice

00:14:19.344 --> 00:14:21.658
but to take -Q and
Q,

00:14:21.658 --> 00:14:24.590
because these two plates are
isolated from the world.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.214
The charge they can have has to
be equal and opposite,

00:14:27.214 --> 00:14:29.837
but -Q has to balance
this, and Q has to

00:14:29.837 --> 00:14:30.678
balance that.
 

00:14:30.678 --> 00:14:34.537
Now if you use the fact that
the voltage drop on this one the

00:14:34.537 --> 00:14:37.428
voltage drop on that one is the
total emf,

00:14:37.428 --> 00:14:44.432
you will find 1/C =
1/C_1_

00:14:44.432 --> 00:14:48.658
 1/C_2.
 

00:14:48.658 --> 00:14:52.184
So capacitors and resistors
combine in exactly the opposite

00:14:52.184 --> 00:14:52.548
way.
 

00:14:52.548 --> 00:14:54.460
This is just in series,
they're additive;

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.769
capacitors in parallel are
additive.

00:14:56.769 --> 00:14:58.750
Whereas for resistance in
parallel,

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:02.269
you add their inverse to get
the inverse of the total,

00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:07.145
and capacitors in series,
you add the inverses to get the

00:15:07.145 --> 00:15:09.149
inverse of the total.
 

00:15:09.149 --> 00:15:12.120
So now I want to do one
slightly more interesting

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:12.740
problem.
 

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.470
It looks like this.
 

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:18.340
You have a voltage E
here.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:25.086
Then you have a capacitor C
and a resistor R,

00:15:25.086 --> 00:15:31.365
and there's a little switch
which we will close at some

00:15:31.365 --> 00:15:32.528
point.
 

00:15:32.528 --> 00:15:35.149
So we want to know what will
happen here.

00:15:35.149 --> 00:15:38.342
Initially you are told the
capacitor's empty,

00:15:38.342 --> 00:15:40.230
there's no charge on it.
 

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:44.572
Once you close the switch,
you should sort of imagine what

00:15:44.572 --> 00:15:45.639
will happen.
 

00:15:45.639 --> 00:15:47.549
This plate is full of positive
charges.

00:15:47.549 --> 00:15:51.639
They don't want to be there.
 

00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:52.679
And this is full of negative
charges.

00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:53.830
They don't want to be there.
 

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.250
So positive charges would like
to go there, negative would like

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.928
to come around,
but the switch did not allow

00:15:57.928 --> 00:15:58.279
that.
 

00:15:58.279 --> 00:16:03.080
But now that it's closed,
some charges will leave this

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:08.604
and some negative charges will
be formed on the other side and

00:16:08.604 --> 00:16:11.048
they'll come back here.
 

00:16:11.048 --> 00:16:14.666
It's very interesting to note
that current doesn't really flow

00:16:14.666 --> 00:16:16.090
through the capacitor.
 

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:19.104
Instead what happens is,
positive charges come here,

00:16:19.104 --> 00:16:22.708
and positive charges leave that
plate, leaving behind negative

00:16:22.708 --> 00:16:23.360
charge.
 

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.945
And that current will come
here, that's the current

00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:29.240
I, and goes back there.
 

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.581
But once the capacitor begins
to charge, it bites the hand

00:16:32.581 --> 00:16:34.985
that feeds it,
because it's then trying to

00:16:34.985 --> 00:16:36.509
drive its own current.
 

00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:37.884
If you ask this guy,
"What do you want to

00:16:37.884 --> 00:16:38.220
do?"
 

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.370
he'll say, "I want to
drive the current that

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:40.908
way."
 

00:16:40.908 --> 00:16:44.870
The capacitor will start
opposing the external voltage,

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.720
and as it charges up more and
more and more,

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.154
eventually, its voltage will
equal the applied voltage and

00:16:51.154 --> 00:16:53.408
then the current will stop.
 

00:16:53.408 --> 00:16:57.303
And when that's happened,
the charge on this capacitor at

00:16:57.303 --> 00:16:58.638
the end,
I'm going to call it

00:16:58.638 --> 00:17:01.432
Q_infinity,
you'll see why,

00:17:01.432 --> 00:17:05.710
will be C times
E.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:11.460
Then the current would stop.
 

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.749
So let's understand in detail
what happens to current from the

00:17:14.749 --> 00:17:16.259
time you close the switch.
 

00:17:16.259 --> 00:17:19.816
So you write down the basic
equation which says start here,

00:17:19.816 --> 00:17:23.617
go around and keep track of the
change in voltage and equate it

00:17:23.617 --> 00:17:24.170
to 0.
 

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.690
So I get a E when I go
through this battery.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:32.391
When I come from here to here,
I drop by an amount

00:17:32.391 --> 00:17:34.308
Q/C.
 

00:17:34.308 --> 00:17:37.250
Then I drop by an amount
RI.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:41.779
Then I'm back to where I
started, which was my 0.

00:17:41.779 --> 00:17:44.180
That's the equation.
 

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:48.731
So now you can write this
equation as--now what's the

00:17:48.731 --> 00:17:52.759
relation between I and
Q here?

00:17:52.759 --> 00:17:55.568
You should think about it.
 

00:17:55.568 --> 00:17:58.913
When we drain the capacitor,
remember, I did a problem

00:17:58.913 --> 00:18:02.509
earlier on where I only had a
capacitor and a resistor.

00:18:02.509 --> 00:18:05.087
There the current was
âˆ’dQ/dt

00:18:05.087 --> 00:18:07.941
because as the current flows,
the capacitor's getting

00:18:07.941 --> 00:18:08.598
drained.
 

00:18:08.598 --> 00:18:10.744
Here actually the current is
dQ/dt,

00:18:10.744 --> 00:18:12.980
so if you're not careful,
you'll get in trouble.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.210
It's dQ/dt,
because any charge that piles

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.961
up on the capacitor leaves the
other plate and goes through

00:18:17.961 --> 00:18:18.390
this.
 

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:22.612
So the current flow is the
charging of the capacitor so

00:18:22.612 --> 00:18:25.348
I is in fact
dQ/dt.

00:18:25.348 --> 00:18:28.281
Otherwise if I is
positive and the current is

00:18:28.281 --> 00:18:30.755
going this way,
charge is building up on the

00:18:30.755 --> 00:18:31.558
capacitor.
 

00:18:31.558 --> 00:18:37.810
So if you remember that,
you get the equation E

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:41.348
= Q/C R dQ/dt.
 

00:18:41.348 --> 00:18:49.288
So that's the equation you want
to solve.

00:18:49.288 --> 00:18:51.190
So how do we think of this
equation?

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:53.750
We tell ourselves if we wait a
long,

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:58.140
long time, until the capacitor
is completely loaded,

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.740
so that it doesn't allow any
more current to flow,

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.390
its voltage will equal this one
and at that point,

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:07.009
dQ/dt will vanish.
 

00:19:07.009 --> 00:19:08.717
And let me call that final
charge

00:19:08.717 --> 00:19:11.704
Q_infinity,
because you will find out it

00:19:11.704 --> 00:19:13.680
happens only after infinite
time.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:20.364
That
Q_infinity/C =

00:19:20.364 --> 00:19:21.509
emf.
 

00:19:21.509 --> 00:19:23.838
So the capacitor is empty to
begin with.

00:19:23.838 --> 00:19:25.380
After infinite time,
it's fully charged,

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.980
meaning this battery cannot
charge it to any higher voltage,

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.987
because its voltage is
precisely balancing that of

00:19:32.987 --> 00:19:33.558
this.
 

00:19:33.558 --> 00:19:36.284
So let me solve--our goal is
still to find Q as the

00:19:36.284 --> 00:19:38.769
function of t,
starting with this equation.

00:19:38.769 --> 00:19:41.787
So we are going to write
Q as a function of

00:19:41.787 --> 00:19:44.250
t, as
Q_infinity,

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:47.700
which is the asymptotic value
some Q twiddle.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.813
You can always write your
answer as 96 something else,

00:19:50.813 --> 00:19:54.220
and something else will adjust
itself to make this true.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:58.259
But let's find the equation for
Q twiddle.

00:19:58.259 --> 00:20:01.255
So take this Q,
put that into the equation and

00:20:01.255 --> 00:20:02.349
see what you get.
 

00:20:02.349 --> 00:20:04.568
Left hand side is E.
 

00:20:04.568 --> 00:20:07.473
Right hand side is
Q/C,

00:20:07.473 --> 00:20:11.105
Q_infinity
/C Q

00:20:11.105 --> 00:20:12.798
twiddle/C.
 

00:20:12.798 --> 00:20:16.920
And when you take dQ/dt,
this is a constant.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.980
So this is just dQ
twiddle/dt. But

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:25.041
Q_inf
inity/C is exactly

00:20:25.041 --> 00:20:29.492
equal to E,
so these terms cancel,

00:20:29.492 --> 00:20:34.869
and the equation I get is this
combination = 0.

00:20:34.869 --> 00:20:35.440
Right?
 

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:44.880
This says dQ/dt,
dQ twiddle/dt =

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:51.779
-RC--I'm sorry,
-Q/RC.

00:20:51.779 --> 00:20:53.460
Q twiddle/RC.
 

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.609
And we know how to integrate
this.

00:20:54.609 --> 00:20:56.160
We've done it many times.
 

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:02.865
With Q twiddle =
Q twiddle at time 0 times

00:21:02.865 --> 00:21:08.230
e to the
âˆ’t/RC.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:14.027
Now Q twiddle at time 0
has to be chosen to satisfy the

00:21:14.027 --> 00:21:18.778
following condition:
what is Q at time 0?

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:22.380
You guys know what charge is on
the capacitor at time 0?

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.009
Do you know?
 

00:21:24.009 --> 00:21:26.740
Student:  Sorry,
my mind is elsewhere.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:27.329
Prof: Okay.
 

00:21:27.329 --> 00:21:28.750
Welcome back here.
 

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.678
So what is the charge on the
capacitor when I started

00:21:31.678 --> 00:21:32.410
everything?
 

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:36.098
Student:  Charge on the
capacitor.

00:21:36.098 --> 00:21:37.920
Prof: At the beginning
of the experiment.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:43.272
Student:  The charge on
the capacitor should equal the

00:21:43.272 --> 00:21:43.630
0.
 

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:44.880
Prof: No,
where I just started.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.230
Anybody know?
 

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.119
Yes?
 

00:21:48.119 --> 00:21:48.960
Student:  0?
 

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.365
Prof: 0,
because I told you the

00:21:51.365 --> 00:21:54.160
capacitor started out with
nothing on it.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.549
That's not a mathematical
result.

00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:56.880
It's a historical fact.
 

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.730
You can't begin an experiment
with charge on the capacitor.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:02.750
I told you today that the
charge on the capacitor is 0.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:10.013
So I've got to get 0 at t =
0 and this guy is E/C Q

00:22:10.013 --> 00:22:16.190
twiddle, that's Q
twiddle of 0 over C.

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:19.140
I'm sorry.
 

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.769
Q_infinity is
EC.

00:22:20.769 --> 00:22:25.420
Is that right?
 

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:31.385
Yes, Q_infinity
= EC Q twiddle

00:22:31.385 --> 00:22:34.368
of 0 and that's got to be 0.
 

00:22:34.368 --> 00:22:38.890
Therefore Q twiddle of 0
= -EC.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:42.761
That means Q(t) =
Q_infinity 

00:22:42.761 --> 00:22:44.009
Q twiddle.
 

00:22:44.009 --> 00:22:54.180
That becomes EC times 1
- e^(-t/RC).

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:58.148
So if you draw the graph of
this, it will satisfy all the

00:22:58.148 --> 00:22:59.779
expectations we have.
 

00:22:59.779 --> 00:23:02.827
If you draw Q as a
function of time,

00:23:02.827 --> 00:23:05.950
at t = 0,
e to the -0 is 1.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:10.088
1 cancels the 1,
you start with 0 charge.

00:23:10.088 --> 00:23:13.250
At Q = infinity,
this guy is gone.

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:19.509
It is EC, which is just
that value.

00:23:19.509 --> 00:23:23.839
So the charge builds up to that
value, but it never quite

00:23:23.839 --> 00:23:26.160
reaches the value EC.
 

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.612
In other words,
the voltage in the capacitor is

00:23:27.612 --> 00:23:28.970
never quite equal to that of the
battery.

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:30.319
There's always some left over.
 

00:23:30.319 --> 00:23:31.380
Yes?
 

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.730
Student:  Where does the
negative come from?

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:34.599
Prof: Here?
 

00:23:34.599 --> 00:23:35.539
Student:  Yes.
 

00:23:35.539 --> 00:23:36.608
Prof: Okay.
 

00:23:36.608 --> 00:23:39.873
I said Q at time 0 is
this guy at times

00:23:39.873 --> 00:23:44.152
Q_infinity,
which is EC Q twiddle at

00:23:44.152 --> 00:23:44.950
time 0.
 

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:46.750
But that had to be equal to 0.
 

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:47.980
Student:  Oh, okay, yeah.
 

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.298
Prof: So that's how I
got that.

00:23:51.298 --> 00:23:52.710
This is a trick to solve the
equation.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:56.000
See, we all sort of know how to
solve this equation.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.280
You may not know how to solve
an equation with an extra term

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.220
here, so this is a trick for
solving that.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.953
So this is the part that's
interesting, in the sense that

00:24:08.953 --> 00:24:12.556
once you write the basic rules
of physics, you get some

00:24:12.556 --> 00:24:13.490
equations.
 

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:16.416
You've got to solve the
equations and it's no longer up

00:24:16.416 --> 00:24:17.990
to you to see what happens.
 

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:21.180
The mathematics rules after
that point.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:25.279
And whatever it tells you,
you rush out to the lab and see

00:24:25.279 --> 00:24:26.358
if it's true.
 

00:24:26.358 --> 00:24:28.582
And with the capacitor,
whose capacitance you have

00:24:28.582 --> 00:24:30.711
measured carefully,
and a resistor which you have

00:24:30.711 --> 00:24:32.846
measured carefully,
you put them together,

00:24:32.846 --> 00:24:36.259
here's a nice prediction on
what will happen as it charges

00:24:36.259 --> 00:24:36.618
up.
 

00:24:36.618 --> 00:24:38.645
For example,
you may want your capacitor to

00:24:38.645 --> 00:24:41.828
hold 80 percent of its maximum
charge and you may like to know,

00:24:41.828 --> 00:24:44.118
"How long should I
wait?"

00:24:44.118 --> 00:24:46.720
If you want it to hold 100
percent of the maximum charge,

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.160
it's never going to get done.
 

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.910
So pick some number.
 

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:54.219
They'll tell you,
if you want 75 percent,

00:24:54.219 --> 00:24:57.990
that's how many seconds you
wait.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:01.020
So this is how you're supposed
to have interplay between

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.845
mathematics and physics,
because what happened was,

00:25:03.845 --> 00:25:07.028
you got into a situation where
you have to solve an equation.

00:25:07.028 --> 00:25:09.913
So this is a differential
equation, but differential

00:25:09.913 --> 00:25:12.684
equations are just questions
which are opposite of

00:25:12.684 --> 00:25:13.588
derivatives.
 

00:25:13.588 --> 00:25:17.842
You're trying to guess a
function about whose derivative

00:25:17.842 --> 00:25:20.779
you know something,
namely this one.

00:25:20.779 --> 00:25:22.288
And it's all guess work.
 

00:25:22.288 --> 00:25:25.699
You keep on guessing and keep
on guessing and you make a table

00:25:25.699 --> 00:25:28.828
of integrals where people tell
you what they guessed,

00:25:28.828 --> 00:25:30.579
and that big fat table of
integrals,

00:25:30.579 --> 00:25:31.818
you can turn to.
 

00:25:31.818 --> 00:25:35.348
But in easy cases,
you can solve it yourself.

00:25:35.348 --> 00:25:39.238
Okay, now there's a homework
problem I'm going to give you

00:25:39.238 --> 00:25:42.650
guys, but I'll tell you what's
in store for you.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:47.765
We want to ask ourselves,
what happens to the energetics

00:25:47.765 --> 00:25:49.440
in this problem.
 

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:57.357
When I started,
how much energy did I have,

00:25:57.357 --> 00:26:00.940
and where was it?
 

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:07.338
Anybody know?
 

00:26:07.338 --> 00:26:11.089
Was there any charge in the
capacitor?

00:26:11.089 --> 00:26:11.759
Nothing.
 

00:26:11.759 --> 00:26:13.087
There's nothing to begin with.
 

00:26:13.087 --> 00:26:13.308
Yes.
 

00:26:13.308 --> 00:26:15.210
Student:  It's all in
your battery.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:16.722
Prof: Yes,
the battery had some internal

00:26:16.722 --> 00:26:17.019
energy.
 

00:26:17.019 --> 00:26:18.690
That's correct.
 

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:21.924
But now, during this
experiment, once I close the

00:26:21.924 --> 00:26:25.834
switch, I think of the battery
as outside my universe so it

00:26:25.834 --> 00:26:27.519
gives me some energy.
 

00:26:27.519 --> 00:26:31.529
How much energy did the battery
give me during the whole

00:26:31.529 --> 00:26:32.259
process?
 

00:26:32.259 --> 00:26:33.460
Yes?
 

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:38.374
Student:  Equal to the
potential energy stored in the

00:26:38.374 --> 00:26:42.538
capacitor the energy dissipated
by the resistor.

00:26:42.538 --> 00:26:43.151
Prof: Right.
 

00:26:43.151 --> 00:26:44.150
So let me repeat what he said.
 

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:47.544
He said it's got to be = to the
energy stored in the capacitor

00:26:47.544 --> 00:26:49.769
the energy dissipated in the
resistor.

00:26:49.769 --> 00:26:52.269
And that's got to be equal to
the work done by the battery.

00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:55.414
It's like saying,
how much work did the ski lift

00:26:55.414 --> 00:26:55.750
do?
 

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:58.851
Well, the work done by the ski
lift is the work it takes to

00:26:58.851 --> 00:27:01.203
carry each person from the
bottom to the top,

00:27:01.203 --> 00:27:03.289
multiplied by the number of
people.

00:27:03.289 --> 00:27:05.230
That's the work done.
 

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:07.792
In electrical language,
that just means the charge

00:27:07.792 --> 00:27:10.880
transported from the bottom to
the top times the voltage.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:20.365
That means the total work done
by the battery = the emf times

00:27:20.365 --> 00:27:28.269
I(t) dt
from 0 to infinity.

00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:30.890
I(t)dt is
a charge that flows in a small

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:33.029
time dt,
and I is not a constant.

00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:35.425
In fact, we can find
I(t) by the

00:27:35.425 --> 00:27:37.130
formula of Q(t).
 

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:42.451
Remember, Q(t) =
EC times 1 - E to

00:27:42.451 --> 00:27:47.032
the âˆ’t/RC.
Then I, which is

00:27:47.032 --> 00:27:51.357
dQ/dt,
you can calculate is EC

00:27:51.357 --> 00:27:56.690
divided by RC times
e^(âˆ’t/RC).

00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:03.068
It becomes E/R times
e^(âˆ’t/RC).

00:28:03.068 --> 00:28:10.568
So the current falls
exponentially in this form.

00:28:10.568 --> 00:28:13.843
At t = 0 the current is
as if the capacitor were not

00:28:13.843 --> 00:28:16.891
even there, because the
capacitor's inert at t =

00:28:16.891 --> 00:28:17.230
0.
 

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:18.240
It has got no charge.
 

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.759
It's not opposing you.
 

00:28:20.759 --> 00:28:22.470
And eventually,
the current goes to 0.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.689
So take that formula for the
current, put it here and do some

00:28:25.689 --> 00:28:26.279
integral.
 

00:28:26.279 --> 00:28:28.259
You get some answer.
 

00:28:28.259 --> 00:28:32.250
That's the energy given by the
battery to us.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:33.890
And what have you done with it?
 

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:38.954
You charge the capacitor to
Â½Q^(2)/2C,

00:28:38.954 --> 00:28:41.924
where Q in the end
should be

00:28:41.924 --> 00:28:44.720
Q_infinity.
 

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.761
The resistor burns power at the
rate VI,

00:28:48.761 --> 00:28:50.960
which is I^(2)R.
 

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.463
So you take this I^(2),
take this I,

00:28:54.463 --> 00:28:57.682
square it, do the integral from
0 to infinity,

00:28:57.682 --> 00:28:59.470
multiply by R.
 

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:04.413
That is the work done in the
resistor, or work dissipated in

00:29:04.413 --> 00:29:05.670
the resistor.
 

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:09.209
You should make sure that this
energy delivered by the battery

00:29:09.209 --> 00:29:12.343
= what is stored by the
capacitor what is dissipated in

00:29:12.343 --> 00:29:13.329
the resistor.
 

00:29:13.329 --> 00:29:15.618
That's your homework.
 

00:29:15.618 --> 00:29:17.776
That just means doing these
integrals and making sure

00:29:17.776 --> 00:29:18.730
everything works out.
 

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:19.930
Yes?
 

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:23.922
Student:  Shouldn't it
be negative, negative

00:29:23.922 --> 00:29:25.039
t/RC?
 

00:29:25.039 --> 00:29:25.809
Prof: Here?
 

00:29:25.809 --> 00:29:27.660
Student:  Yes.
 

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:31.400
Prof: Okay,
finally I have a chance.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.539
This negative sign is going to
cancel that.

00:29:35.539 --> 00:29:36.588
Student:  Oh, okay.
 

00:29:36.588 --> 00:29:38.460
Prof: Look,
don't give up,

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.910
okay, because just like you
thought, I make mistakes too.

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:45.470
So I never mind it when you
guys do that.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:48.431
In this case,
I'll tell you why I sort of

00:29:48.431 --> 00:29:50.430
knew what the answer was.
 

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:53.096
I know the answer's positive
because the current's going to

00:29:53.096 --> 00:29:53.740
be positive.
 

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.438
So if I'd kept the extra -
sign, it will mean the current's

00:29:56.438 --> 00:29:59.368
going against the battery and I
would know that doesn't work.

00:29:59.368 --> 00:30:02.112
Quite often,
we're allowed to use the sign

00:30:02.112 --> 00:30:04.788
of the answer,
we're allowed to guess the

00:30:04.788 --> 00:30:05.390
sign.
 

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:07.630
For example,
what's the height of a person?

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:11.599
You said the answer was 6 feet,
but I don't know if it's or -.

00:30:11.599 --> 00:30:13.048
Well, you should know it's .
 

00:30:13.048 --> 00:30:15.240
You're talking about the height
of a person.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.920
What's the depth to which he
sank?

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.828
Well, there it can be negative.
 

00:30:18.828 --> 00:30:21.480
So you should know by context
whether the answer is positive

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.108
or negative.
 

00:30:22.108 --> 00:30:25.618
That's a very useful check as
far as signs go.

00:30:25.618 --> 00:30:29.307
Now as far as overall formulas
go, you can always take extreme

00:30:29.307 --> 00:30:32.269
limits of every answer and see
if it's correct.

00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:35.174
In the beginning,
just when you close the switch,

00:30:35.174 --> 00:30:37.656
there's the battery,
there's the resistor,

00:30:37.656 --> 00:30:41.288
the capacitor doesn't oppose
you, so you get e/R.

00:30:41.288 --> 00:30:43.380
At the end of the day,
the capacitor's fully charged,

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.467
it's neutralizing the battery
by driving the current in the

00:30:46.467 --> 00:30:49.539
opposite way with equal voltage,
so the current should vanish.

00:30:49.539 --> 00:30:55.130
These are some tests.
 

00:30:55.130 --> 00:31:00.419
All right, so let's continue
now to the last thing in

00:31:00.419 --> 00:31:02.711
circuits,
which I'm not going to do any

00:31:02.711 --> 00:31:04.740
more,
but I'll tell you the kind of

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.390
stuff people throw at you.
 

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:10.380
So here is some guy,
some resistor,

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:16.483
branches into two other
branches, some other voltage,

00:31:16.483 --> 00:31:18.480
join it here.
 

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.778
This is E,
this is R_1,

00:31:21.778 --> 00:31:24.528
R_2,
R_3.

00:31:24.528 --> 00:31:28.058
This is E_2,
let's say.

00:31:28.058 --> 00:31:30.555
You've done stuff like this
before, but let me remind you

00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:31.089
the trick.
 

00:31:31.089 --> 00:31:32.369
The trick is very ancient.
 

00:31:32.369 --> 00:31:34.230
We all know what the trick is.
 

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:38.210
First is, you've got to know
how many unknowns there are.

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:42.410
If you can say the current here
is I_1.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:43.849
I don't know what
I_1 is;

00:31:43.849 --> 00:31:45.440
that's an unknown.
 

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.712
The current flowing through
this guy is

00:31:47.712 --> 00:31:49.088
I_2.
 

00:31:49.088 --> 00:31:51.145
The current flowing through
this guy is

00:31:51.145 --> 00:31:53.095
I_3,
but I know that

00:31:53.095 --> 00:31:56.180
I_3 = I_1
- I_2.

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:56.849
Do you agree?
 

00:31:56.849 --> 00:31:58.400
I_1 comes here.
 

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.008
If I_2 goes
there, I_1 -

00:32:00.008 --> 00:32:00.950
I_2 goes there.
 

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:02.907
So I'm actually solving one of
the equations,

00:32:02.907 --> 00:32:04.910
which is that I_1
= I_2

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:05.890
I_3.
 

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:09.088
Let's put that into the
equation.

00:32:09.088 --> 00:32:11.269
Then you have to write,
so how many unknowns do I have?

00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:13.612
I have two unknowns,
I_1 and

00:32:13.612 --> 00:32:16.753
I_2. So I have
to get two equations for two

00:32:16.753 --> 00:32:18.877
unknowns,
and one equation will be--you

00:32:18.877 --> 00:32:19.828
can do many things.
 

00:32:19.828 --> 00:32:23.690
You can start here,
go around like this and say the

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:25.618
change in voltage is 0.
 

00:32:25.618 --> 00:32:32.192
That would tell me
E_1 - R_1

00:32:32.192 --> 00:32:39.289
I_1 - R_2
I_2 = 0.

00:32:39.289 --> 00:32:40.980
Are you guys with me now?
 

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.384
You drop here,
you drop here,

00:32:43.384 --> 00:32:45.190
then you come back.
 

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:49.160
Then you can take another loop
that goes like this.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.125
Then you will say
E_1 - R_1

00:32:53.125 --> 00:32:57.739
I_1 - R_3
times I_1 -

00:32:57.739 --> 00:32:59.519
I_2.
 

00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:01.640
Now let's look here.
 

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:06.201
You keep going the same way,
but here you drop by an amount

00:33:06.201 --> 00:33:08.009
E_2.
 

00:33:08.009 --> 00:33:16.742
Then you've come over here and
you come to the other end and

00:33:16.742 --> 00:33:18.519
you get 0.
 

00:33:18.519 --> 00:33:21.553
Now somebody can say,
"Hey, why don't I start

00:33:21.553 --> 00:33:25.207
here, go around that loop and
say that voltage difference is

00:33:25.207 --> 00:33:25.950
0?"
 

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:30.057
I'm getting the third equation,
but there are only two

00:33:30.057 --> 00:33:30.910
unknowns.
 

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:36.605
So you math-minded people
should sort of know what will

00:33:36.605 --> 00:33:40.509
happen if I write a third
equation.

00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:42.109
What do you think will happen?
 

00:33:42.109 --> 00:33:47.180
Student:  Nothing.
 

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.288
Prof: What do you mean,
nothing will happen?

00:33:50.288 --> 00:33:52.288
Student:  It's not going
to help you get any more.

00:33:52.288 --> 00:33:55.500
Prof: In what manner
will it prove to be useless?

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.950
Student:  It will be a
combination of the other two.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:00.009
Prof: Right.
 

00:34:00.009 --> 00:34:02.964
You can deduce the third
equation by fiddling with the

00:34:02.964 --> 00:34:03.690
other two.
 

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:07.396
Maybe 9 times one equation - 6
times the second equation will

00:34:07.396 --> 00:34:08.880
be the third equation.
 

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.679
Therefore it's not an
independent equation.

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:14.746
It will always turn out that if
you've got two unknowns,

00:34:14.746 --> 00:34:16.809
you need two independent
equations.

00:34:16.809 --> 00:34:19.101
If you can get three and four
and five, you will find out

00:34:19.101 --> 00:34:21.719
they're not telling you anything
new, so that's when you stop.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:24.373
If you don't know that,
you may start writing all kinds

00:34:24.373 --> 00:34:25.110
of equations.
 

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:27.059
You may think,
here's another loop.

00:34:27.059 --> 00:34:29.820
Here's another guy who wants to
do this.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.710
You can do all that,
but you'll keep getting the

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:33.510
same stuff.
 

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:48.679
Okay, now we will really start
new topic: magnetism.

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:52.003
Well, you start this because
every time you think you're done

00:34:52.003 --> 00:34:54.784
with physics,
somebody does some experiment

00:34:54.784 --> 00:34:57.070
and it doesn't fit what you
know,

00:34:57.070 --> 00:35:00.050
so you've got to make up new
stuff.

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:04.250
So magnetism you know was
discovered in Ancient Greece,

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:08.114
when parents noticed kids are
sticking stuff on the

00:35:08.114 --> 00:35:11.670
refrigerator using some little
black things.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:13.280
So more experiments.
 

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.960
I obviously don't know all the
details.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.150
But it was discovered in many
ways.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:21.677
One was in little compass
needles which told you which way

00:35:21.677 --> 00:35:22.420
was north.
 

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.235
So I'm going to give you a
string of things that happened

00:35:25.235 --> 00:35:28.403
that tell you there is something
going on that is not covered by

00:35:28.403 --> 00:35:31.119
anything I've written down so
far in this course,

00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:33.260
new phenomena that don't make
sense.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.250
Here's the simplest one.
 

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:38.719
There's a wire carrying some
current.

00:35:38.719 --> 00:35:41.260
There's a little charge sitting
here.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.630
Nothing happens.
 

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:45.463
Because the wire is
electrically neutral,

00:35:45.463 --> 00:35:48.440
the charge Q doesn't do
anything.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:53.179
Now the charge begins to move
at velocity v.

00:35:53.179 --> 00:35:57.119
Then you suddenly find the
charge attracted to the wire.

00:35:57.119 --> 00:36:00.179
It starts bending in.
 

00:36:00.179 --> 00:36:03.027
That is not the electrical
force, because the electrical

00:36:03.027 --> 00:36:03.699
force is 0.
 

00:36:03.699 --> 00:36:05.768
The wire is electrically
neutral.

00:36:05.768 --> 00:36:09.556
It doesn't care if the charge
is moving or not,

00:36:09.556 --> 00:36:11.449
so it is a new force.
 

00:36:11.449 --> 00:36:15.989
And if the charge goes this
way, the force is repulsive.

00:36:15.989 --> 00:36:19.420
That's just one phenomenon you
notice.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:24.822
Another thing you notice is
there are little things called

00:36:24.822 --> 00:36:26.150
bar magnets.
 

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:29.059
They seem to have a north and a
south.

00:36:29.059 --> 00:36:32.157
And if you bring it next to
another bar magnet,

00:36:32.157 --> 00:36:35.862
which has got a north and
south, you find they repel and

00:36:35.862 --> 00:36:37.750
south and north attract.
 

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:41.228
Then you take this compass
needle that people use to find

00:36:41.228 --> 00:36:44.829
the north direction for the
earth, and you put it somewhere

00:36:44.829 --> 00:36:45.389
here.
 

00:36:45.389 --> 00:36:48.474
You find that it swings,
if it's free to pivot,

00:36:48.474 --> 00:36:50.889
and points in a certain
direction.

00:36:50.889 --> 00:36:53.327
And if you use that as a
direction of a certain field,

00:36:53.327 --> 00:36:56.226
you can draw these pictures and
you sort of know what it's going

00:36:56.226 --> 00:36:57.010
to look like.
 

00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:01.940
They look like this.
 

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.467
So this means if you put a
compass needle here,

00:37:04.467 --> 00:37:06.280
the north will point like that.
 

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:09.800
That's what I mean.
 

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.699
That's another phenomenon.
 

00:37:11.699 --> 00:37:15.230
Then once you found out about
electric currents,

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:18.639
you also found that if you took
a coil of wire,

00:37:18.639 --> 00:37:23.184
then a compass needle somewhere
here began to respond to a

00:37:23.184 --> 00:37:26.510
magnetic field,
which if you plot,

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:29.239
seemed to look like this.
 

00:37:29.239 --> 00:37:33.518
It seemed to look just like a
magnet with a north pole here

00:37:33.518 --> 00:37:35.289
and a south pole here.
 

00:37:35.289 --> 00:37:36.280
There are no magnets at all.
 

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:40.505
You just had a coil of wire
carrying the current in a

00:37:40.505 --> 00:37:42.130
certain direction.
 

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:44.349
It goes like this.
 

00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:49.503
Then the magnetic field lines,
which you plot by moving the

00:37:49.503 --> 00:37:52.260
compass needle,
they do this.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.670
So all I'm trying to say is
there are several phenomena

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:58.829
going on,
and the clue that you get is,

00:37:58.829 --> 00:38:03.630
why didn't I need this before,
and why do I need it now?

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:07.231
What is new in this problem
compared to the problems I've

00:38:07.231 --> 00:38:07.809
solved?
 

00:38:07.809 --> 00:38:12.541
Can you see what's making this
problem outside the realm of

00:38:12.541 --> 00:38:14.010
what we studied?
 

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:16.400
What's the one feature you
notice from electrostatics?

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.219
Yes?
 

00:38:17.219 --> 00:38:18.440
Student:  The charges
are moving.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:21.639
Prof: Everything is
moving.

00:38:21.639 --> 00:38:26.123
The wire carries charges which
are moving and this little guy

00:38:26.123 --> 00:38:29.860
who got attracted or repelled,
he's also moving.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:35.268
So magnetism is caused by
moving charges and it's felt by

00:38:35.268 --> 00:38:36.909
moving charges.
 

00:38:36.909 --> 00:38:39.590
They've got to move to play
this game.

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:48.536
So magnetism is caused by
moving charges and it's felt by

00:38:48.536 --> 00:38:55.086
moving charges,
whereas in electrostatics,

00:38:55.086 --> 00:39:00.039
we didn't have that motion.
 

00:39:00.039 --> 00:39:01.030
Yes?
 

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:03.780
Student:  What about
reference frames?

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:06.159
Prof: Yes,
her question was,

00:39:06.159 --> 00:39:09.869
how about reference frames,
namely moving according to

00:39:09.869 --> 00:39:10.989
whom, right?
 

00:39:10.989 --> 00:39:14.150
So I will come to that near the
end when we do relativity,

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:17.793
when I remind you of some ideas
of relativity and see what that

00:39:17.793 --> 00:39:20.440
has to say about electricity and
magnetism.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.702
But you are free,
even in the relativistic

00:39:22.702 --> 00:39:25.518
theory, to take the view that
you are not moving.

00:39:25.518 --> 00:39:28.710
As long you're an inertial
frame, that means a frame in

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:32.702
which Newton's laws are valid,
you can apply all the laws of

00:39:32.702 --> 00:39:35.170
physics as if you were not
moving.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:38.400
I'm just saying for that
observer, who's inertial,

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.478
it's found that when charges
are moving according to him or

00:39:41.478 --> 00:39:43.715
her,
they produce currents which

00:39:43.715 --> 00:39:47.449
produce a field,
and the charges in that field

00:39:47.449 --> 00:39:49.079
will also respond.
 

00:39:49.079 --> 00:39:51.780
Now you can say,
"What's so special about

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:52.139
you?
 

00:39:52.139 --> 00:39:55.380
I will go to a new frame of
reference,right?"

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:57.998
I'll come back to that later,
but I cannot resist telling you

00:39:57.998 --> 00:40:00.050
at least the answer to some of
the questions.

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:03.771
For example,
if this charge is moving at a

00:40:03.771 --> 00:40:08.126
speed v and I'm
completely stymied by this

00:40:08.126 --> 00:40:13.119
velocity, because I don't know
how to deal with it.

00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:16.932
There's one way to deal with
it, which is to get on a train

00:40:16.932 --> 00:40:20.090
that goes at the same velocity
as this charge.

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:24.987
Then this charge is at rest and
if it still bends towards the

00:40:24.987 --> 00:40:27.050
wire,
which it will--you agree that

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:29.976
if you go on a moving train,
a charge attracted to the wire

00:40:29.976 --> 00:40:32.079
will continue to be attracted to
the wire.

00:40:32.079 --> 00:40:33.550
You've got to say,
"How come?

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:35.268
How do you explain that?"
 

00:40:35.268 --> 00:40:39.510
Neutral wire attracting a
charge.

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:41.827
Either you can say it's all
happening because you're in a

00:40:41.827 --> 00:40:44.835
moving train,
but relativity tells you,

00:40:44.835 --> 00:40:50.092
people in a moving train are
entitled to the same laws of

00:40:50.092 --> 00:40:54.130
physics as people in a
non-moving train.

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:55.659
Now it's true for Amtrak.
 

00:40:55.659 --> 00:40:58.123
As long as you can get the
train to move,

00:40:58.123 --> 00:41:00.219
you can make the same
statement.

00:41:00.219 --> 00:41:03.869
So how does a person in a
moving train explain it?

00:41:03.869 --> 00:41:04.909
What do you think happens?
 

00:41:04.909 --> 00:41:05.619
Yes?
 

00:41:05.619 --> 00:41:07.911
Student:  The wire looks
like it's moving back in that

00:41:07.911 --> 00:41:08.369
direction.
 

00:41:08.369 --> 00:41:10.400
Prof: The wire may look
as though it's moving backwards,

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:14.784
but still, a neutral thing
moving forwards or backwards

00:41:14.784 --> 00:41:19.960
shouldn't matter,
right?

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:23.980
A neutral rod, let it move.
 

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.599
Why does it matter?
 

00:41:26.599 --> 00:41:28.018
So what do you think happens?
 

00:41:28.018 --> 00:41:31.063
First of all,
do you think it will be

00:41:31.063 --> 00:41:35.289
attracted to the wire,
even in the moving train?

00:41:35.289 --> 00:41:36.780
Yes, no?
 

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.072
It will be attracted,
because if I see it moving

00:41:39.072 --> 00:41:40.976
towards the wire,
you can go on a train,

00:41:40.976 --> 00:41:43.369
you can go on a plane,
you will also see it's moving

00:41:43.369 --> 00:41:43.940
towards it.
 

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.202
Maybe the rate will be
different and so on,

00:41:46.202 --> 00:41:48.951
but the fact that it's getting
closer to the wire is

00:41:48.951 --> 00:41:49.760
undeniable.
 

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.619
And there's going to be no new
physics.

00:41:51.619 --> 00:41:54.173
You're just going to rely on
good old electromagnetism,

00:41:54.173 --> 00:41:57.059
because electromagnetism is
supposed to work for everybody.

00:41:57.059 --> 00:42:00.440
In fact, that's how the
relativity--

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.376
even though electromagnetism
was discovered before

00:42:02.376 --> 00:42:04.422
relativity,
it obeys all the principles

00:42:04.422 --> 00:42:06.250
demanded by relativistic theory.
 

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:09.670
So everybody should have the
same laws of motion.

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:12.809
So have you found a way out now?
 

00:42:12.809 --> 00:42:13.690
Yes?
 

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:17.010
Student:  Would the wire
look like a bar magnet?

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:19.164
Prof: No,
because bar magnet means you're

00:42:19.164 --> 00:42:20.449
going to magnetism,
right?

00:42:20.449 --> 00:42:23.851
So let's say I don't know any
magnetism, because the charge is

00:42:23.851 --> 00:42:24.409
at rest.
 

00:42:24.409 --> 00:42:27.239
A charge at rest doesn't care
if it's near a bar magnet.

00:42:27.239 --> 00:42:27.989
Yes?
 

00:42:27.989 --> 00:42:29.530
Student:  ________ lines.
 

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:31.007
Prof: So what should be
happening to the wire,

00:42:31.007 --> 00:42:31.320
you guys?
 

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.050
Tell me?
 

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.130
Yes?
 

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:37.099
Student:  If you're
moving and then the charges in

00:42:37.099 --> 00:42:39.882
the wire are moving,
say you're moving at the same

00:42:39.882 --> 00:42:41.769
speed as the charges on the
wire,

00:42:41.769 --> 00:42:42.889
it would seem stationary.
 

00:42:42.889 --> 00:42:46.862
So it's just like the point
charge being attracted to a

00:42:46.862 --> 00:42:48.360
bunch of--
Prof: Right.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.139
Why is the point charge
attracted to a neutral wire?

00:42:51.139 --> 00:42:55.929
That is my question.
 

00:42:55.929 --> 00:42:56.840
Yes?
 

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.018
Student:  The wire isn't
neutral,

00:42:59.018 --> 00:43:02.530
because you're moving along
with the negative charges,

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:05.923
so they stay there,
but then the positive charges

00:43:05.923 --> 00:43:07.465
keep--
Prof: That's correct.

00:43:07.465 --> 00:43:08.579
So let me explain what he said.
 

00:43:08.579 --> 00:43:12.760
In fact, the answer is,
the wire will not be neutral.

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.809
So how did that happen?
 

00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:16.655
You might say,
"Oh, there's a Lorentz

00:43:16.655 --> 00:43:18.500
contraction,"
meaning the lengths get

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.456
contracted,
but if the wire is neutral,

00:43:20.456 --> 00:43:22.699
the positives and negatives all
get compressed,

00:43:22.699 --> 00:43:26.679
it still should look neutral,
but that's not how it is.

00:43:26.679 --> 00:43:29.552
Remember, in a real conductor
you've got positive charges,

00:43:29.552 --> 00:43:32.626
which are at rest and negative
charges which are moving in the

00:43:32.626 --> 00:43:34.139
opposite direction,
right?

00:43:34.139 --> 00:43:38.206
So I do that by taking a rod,
which is positively charged,

00:43:38.206 --> 00:43:41.847
and I take another rod,
which is negatively charged,

00:43:41.847 --> 00:43:44.059
and I simply move this rod.
 

00:43:44.059 --> 00:43:46.860
That will produce a current.
 

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:50.090
Now if the wire is neutral,
I think you guys can understand

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:52.731
that the density on this,
in its own rest frame,

00:43:52.731 --> 00:43:55.340
will be different from the
density of charges here,

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:57.550
because lengths get contracted.
 

00:43:57.550 --> 00:44:01.938
It is a contracted wire that
should have the same density as

00:44:01.938 --> 00:44:05.266
the positive wire,
therefore in reality,

00:44:05.266 --> 00:44:07.952
the contracted wire,
length contracted with

00:44:07.952 --> 00:44:11.025
increased density,
should match the density of

00:44:11.025 --> 00:44:11.539
this.
 

00:44:11.539 --> 00:44:16.023
But if I go to the moving
frame, what will happen is this

00:44:16.023 --> 00:44:19.387
guy will freeze,
and that guy will move the

00:44:19.387 --> 00:44:20.750
opposite way.
 

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:22.983
This guy will stop moving;
the other will move the

00:44:22.983 --> 00:44:23.699
opposite way.
 

00:44:23.699 --> 00:44:26.327
But then you can show--I will
do that calculation for you

00:44:26.327 --> 00:44:28.300
later--
that the densities that

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.268
previously canceled will no
longer cancel,

00:44:31.268 --> 00:44:33.280
and the wire will have a net
positive charge.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.230
The point is,
there's a lack of symmetry

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:37.280
between the positive and
negative charges,

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.980
because one of them is moving.
 

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:42.501
In fact, if you took the simple
example where the charges in the

00:44:42.501 --> 00:44:45.239
wire are moving at the same
speed as this guy--

00:44:45.239 --> 00:44:47.449
let's imagine positive charges
can move--

00:44:47.449 --> 00:44:49.590
and if they're moving at the
same speed as this guy,

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:51.650
if you stop this,
you will also stop those,

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:53.780
and they will go the opposite
way.

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:57.119
But if they go the opposite
way, they will contract,

00:44:57.119 --> 00:44:59.519
and when they contract,
they will no longer be balanced

00:44:59.519 --> 00:45:01.719
by this,
and the positive charge will be

00:45:01.719 --> 00:45:05.110
attracted to the negative wire,
and not only attracted.

00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:09.829
It will be the same force that
you will get when you learn

00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:11.320
about magnetism.
 

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:14.835
So I'll do this in detail,
but I'm just telling you that

00:45:14.835 --> 00:45:18.672
you don't have to worry about
which frame of reference you're

00:45:18.672 --> 00:45:19.119
in.
 

00:45:19.119 --> 00:45:21.914
The laws of physics are
guaranteed to work for all

00:45:21.914 --> 00:45:24.710
frames of reference in uniform
relative motion.

00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:27.460
So when I say velocity is
v, I mean according to

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:28.429
any one observer.
 

00:45:28.429 --> 00:45:31.750
That could be you.
 

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:34.150
So you've got all this
phenomena.

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:38.331
Now I'm going to give you the
fundamental equations of

00:45:38.331 --> 00:45:41.409
magnetostatics,
that will explain to you

00:45:41.409 --> 00:45:44.329
everything I've described so
far.

00:45:44.329 --> 00:45:45.909
So it will have two parts.
 

00:45:45.909 --> 00:45:50.356
The first part will be,
what is the force felt by a

00:45:50.356 --> 00:45:54.449
charge that's in motion in a
magnetic field?

00:45:54.449 --> 00:45:57.559
The next thing is,
how do you produce a magnetic

00:45:57.559 --> 00:45:58.090
field?
 

00:45:58.090 --> 00:45:59.670
Well, the answer is electric
currents.

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:01.878
Then you can ask,
how does a current here produce

00:46:01.878 --> 00:46:03.030
a magnetic field there?
 

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:05.500
What's the analog of Coulomb's
law?

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.920
Coulomb's law is charges here
producing the electric field

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:09.400
there.
 

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.400
Magnetism is a current here
producing a magnetic field

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:14.780
there, so you will have the
second part.

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:18.322
So I'm saying that this
formula, q times E

00:46:18.322 --> 00:46:19.869
is the electric force.
 

00:46:19.869 --> 00:46:22.842
Then there's the fact that the
E here due to this guy is

00:46:22.842 --> 00:46:24.666
1/r^(2) times the
q here,

00:46:24.666 --> 00:46:25.050
etc.
 

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:27.440
You need both parts.
 

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.530
I'm going to give the two parts.
 

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:31.188
The second part will come
later, but first is,

00:46:31.188 --> 00:46:34.143
if you have a charged particle
in a magnetic field,

00:46:34.143 --> 00:46:35.739
what's the force on it?
 

00:46:35.739 --> 00:46:37.960
So here's the answer.
 

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:42.925
The total force of a charge
particle q is this guy

00:46:42.925 --> 00:46:46.918
that we already know,
the cross product of the

00:46:46.918 --> 00:46:50.199
velocity with the magnetic
field.

00:46:50.199 --> 00:46:53.731
The direction of the field is
determined by the compass

00:46:53.731 --> 00:46:54.320
needle.
 

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:56.909
That's how the B is
directed.

00:46:56.909 --> 00:47:00.952
But if you want,
this force is called the

00:47:00.952 --> 00:47:02.570
Lorentz force.
 

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:05.974
It is not invented by Lorentz,
but he did so many things in

00:47:05.974 --> 00:47:08.030
this field, it's named after
him.

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:11.289
You can take this to be a
postulate,

00:47:11.289 --> 00:47:12.909
the summary of years of
experiment,

00:47:12.909 --> 00:47:14.690
and you can say,
"I want to begin

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:16.280
here," you can begin here.
 

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.088
You're never going to derive
this, but this is an

00:47:19.088 --> 00:47:20.260
experimental fact.
 

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:22.349
So if I go to a part of the
room and say,

00:47:22.349 --> 00:47:25.536
"Find the electric field
here," I think you all know

00:47:25.536 --> 00:47:26.320
what to do.
 

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:27.989
We've done it many times.
 

00:47:27.989 --> 00:47:29.929
Take a coulomb and put it there.
 

00:47:29.929 --> 00:47:34.047
Find the force on it,
and that's actually the

00:47:34.047 --> 00:47:35.639
electric field.
 

00:47:35.639 --> 00:47:38.228
If you put 5 coulombs,
you divide the force by 5 and

00:47:38.228 --> 00:47:39.650
that's the electric field.
 

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:41.960
If I tell you,
what's a magnetic field,

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:45.418
you can take a coulomb there,
but you still have to find

00:47:45.418 --> 00:47:47.099
out--
by the way, the electric field

00:47:47.099 --> 00:47:49.945
problem's very easy,
because the direction of the

00:47:49.945 --> 00:47:53.469
electric field is simply the
motion of the charge.

00:47:53.469 --> 00:47:56.291
In the magnetic problem,
there are lots of directions

00:47:56.291 --> 00:47:56.889
involved.
 

00:47:56.889 --> 00:47:59.880
There's the velocity of the
charge.

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.684
There's a magnetic field,
there's a magnetic force,

00:48:02.684 --> 00:48:04.480
and they form a cross product.
 

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:07.630
v x B is the
force.

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:10.257
So if someone says,
"Which way is B

00:48:10.257 --> 00:48:11.230
pointing?"
 

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:15.077
you'll have to shoot a few
particles and find out how they

00:48:15.077 --> 00:48:15.550
bend.
 

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:19.043
If you shot it exactly parallel
to B it won't bend at

00:48:19.043 --> 00:48:19.400
all.
 

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.420
That's the direction of
B.

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:24.195
If you sent it perpendicular to
B, it will bend the most,

00:48:24.195 --> 00:48:26.309
because the cross product will
be the biggest.

00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:30.143
Then you can slowly determine
by some experiments what the

00:48:30.143 --> 00:48:31.690
value of B is.
 

00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:35.869
So let's do a couple of simple
problems where we just use this

00:48:35.869 --> 00:48:37.789
part, v x B.
 

00:48:37.789 --> 00:48:41.179
But there's a very important
aspect of v x B.

00:48:41.179 --> 00:48:44.706
Wherever a force acts on a
body, you know force dot

00:48:44.706 --> 00:48:48.800
velocity is the power or the
rate at which work is done.

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.719
If you take the electromagnetic
force dot velocity,

00:48:51.719 --> 00:48:58.789
you get q times v â‹…
E q times v

00:48:58.789 --> 00:49:04.219
â‹… v x B and
that is 0.

00:49:04.219 --> 00:49:07.320
So you know why v â‹…
v x B is 0?

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.949
It's again a purely
mathematical result.

00:49:09.949 --> 00:49:10.889
Yes?
 

00:49:10.889 --> 00:49:12.764
Student:  Because
v cross B is going

00:49:12.764 --> 00:49:14.753
to be perpendicular to--
Prof: v x

00:49:14.753 --> 00:49:17.489
B is orthogonal to both
v and to B,

00:49:17.489 --> 00:49:19.601
so it's coming out--in this
case, if B and v are in the

00:49:19.601 --> 00:49:21.414
blackboard,
v x B is outside

00:49:21.414 --> 00:49:22.090
the blackboard.
 

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:25.849
Its dot product with anything
in the blackboard is 0.

00:49:25.849 --> 00:49:30.065
So whenever you have a vector
dotting itself cross something

00:49:30.065 --> 00:49:31.780
else, the answer is 0.
 

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:35.376
That means the magnetic field
is always perpendicular to the

00:49:35.376 --> 00:49:36.900
motion of the particle.
 

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:40.019
That means it doesn't do any
work, never.

00:49:40.019 --> 00:49:41.389
Not just weekends.
 

00:49:41.389 --> 00:49:44.329
The magnetic field doesn't do
any work.

00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:46.199
So you can say,
"Who cares about such a

00:49:46.199 --> 00:49:46.809
thing?"
 

00:49:46.809 --> 00:49:48.150
Electric fields do a lot of
work.

00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:49.869
They speed up particles,
they slow down.

00:49:49.869 --> 00:49:52.684
The kinetic energy of a
particle will never change due

00:49:52.684 --> 00:49:53.960
to the magnetic field.
 

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:56.601
And yet you will see,
even though it's not able to do

00:49:56.601 --> 00:49:58.905
anything by itself,
it's extremely useful in

00:49:58.905 --> 00:50:01.750
getting a lot of things done,
like generators and so on.

00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:03.489
They rely on the magnetic field.
 

00:50:03.489 --> 00:50:05.920
So we'll see that,
but at the moment,

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:06.730
it's fact.
 

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:10.664
The force is always
perpendicular to the velocity

00:50:10.664 --> 00:50:12.550
for a magnetic field.
 

00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:17.869
So now we are going to do one
or two simple problems.

00:50:17.869 --> 00:50:21.050
First problem,
let me take the easiest one.

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:24.668
I want to find a way to select
from a beam of particles,

00:50:24.668 --> 00:50:28.418
which are all going from left
to right, those which have a

00:50:28.418 --> 00:50:29.800
certain velocity.
 

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:33.349
I want a velocity filter,
and I cannot seem them

00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:35.579
microscopically;
they are little guys.

00:50:35.579 --> 00:50:38.289
But they're moving,
they're all moving like this.

00:50:38.289 --> 00:50:42.070
Here is how we can make a
velocity filter.

00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:47.606
You take two parallel plates,
charge them up so the electric

00:50:47.606 --> 00:50:49.860
field looks like this.
 

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:56.630
This particle q will then bend
like this in the electric field.

00:50:56.630 --> 00:51:01.280
Now put a magnetic field into
the paper.

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:05.840
Let me make sure I got this
right.

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:08.340
Yes.
 

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:11.449
Put a magnetic field into the
board that's shown by this

00:51:11.449 --> 00:51:11.960
symbol.
 

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:16.905
Magnetic field coming out
towards you is shown by dots,

00:51:16.905 --> 00:51:21.485
and coming away from
you--coming towards you is the

00:51:21.485 --> 00:51:25.699
dot, and going away from you is
the cross.

00:51:25.699 --> 00:51:26.920
That comes from the arrow.
 

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:29.704
If you have an arrow,
if you look at the arrow from

00:51:29.704 --> 00:51:32.655
behind, it looks like this,
and if it looks like this,

00:51:32.655 --> 00:51:33.880
you run like hell.
 

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:36.530
These are the two things.
 

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:39.202
So I want to show you that
B is going into the

00:51:39.202 --> 00:51:39.869
blackboard.
 

00:51:39.869 --> 00:51:42.179
Now what's the force due to
B?

00:51:42.179 --> 00:51:44.126
Take the cross product--that's
what I was trying to do in my

00:51:44.126 --> 00:51:45.445
head,
make sure I got it

00:51:45.445 --> 00:51:48.672
right--v x B is
turning a screwdriver from

00:51:48.672 --> 00:51:50.079
v to B.
 

00:51:50.079 --> 00:51:55.304
Let's see, B is into the
board, v x B will

00:51:55.304 --> 00:51:56.570
be like this.
 

00:51:56.570 --> 00:52:03.309
Therefore the total force on a
charge will be q times

00:52:03.309 --> 00:52:06.786
E,
which is downstairs--I mean,

00:52:06.786 --> 00:52:11.610
pointing down,
and v x B which

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:13.610
is pointing up.
 

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:17.981
You can see then for a given
value of E and B,

00:52:17.981 --> 00:52:21.983
for any randomly chosen
velocity, these forces will not

00:52:21.983 --> 00:52:22.800
cancel.
 

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:27.679
So some guys may bend like
this, some guys may bend like

00:52:27.679 --> 00:52:31.760
this, or some guys will go
straight through.

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:36.990
They are the ones for whom
E = v x B

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:43.250
or the magnitude of the velocity
is E divided by B.

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:47.429
So only those particles with
that velocity will make it.

00:52:47.429 --> 00:52:51.085
In other words,
imagine this thing is very,

00:52:51.085 --> 00:52:52.130
very long.
 

00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:55.710
Some things will go hit it
there, others may hit it here.

00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:59.436
If you are just right,
you will make it to the other

00:52:59.436 --> 00:53:01.920
side, so it's a velocity filter.
 

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.969
Now you should be able to
answer the following question

00:53:04.969 --> 00:53:06.889
without doing long calculations.
 

00:53:06.889 --> 00:53:09.541
The guys hitting the top,
are they faster than the

00:53:09.541 --> 00:53:10.949
desired speed or slower?
 

00:53:10.949 --> 00:53:16.090
Student:  Faster.
 

00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:20.190
Prof: Because what?
 

00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:21.110
You understand that?
 

00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:24.289
If they're going up,
the magnetic force is winning.

00:53:24.289 --> 00:53:27.007
The magnetic force is the only
one who cares about your

00:53:27.007 --> 00:53:28.969
velocity, so the velocity is too
big.

00:53:28.969 --> 00:53:31.340
If they're falling down,
electric force is winning.

00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:35.041
Electric force is a constant,
magnetic force is velocity

00:53:35.041 --> 00:53:35.849
dependent.
 

00:53:35.849 --> 00:53:40.655
So the fast guys go here,
slow and the right one comes

00:53:40.655 --> 00:53:41.289
here.
 

00:53:41.289 --> 00:53:43.599
Here's another exercise you can
do.

00:53:43.599 --> 00:53:50.425
There is a magnetic field
coming out of the blackboard and

00:53:50.425 --> 00:53:53.539
it's uniform in density.
 

00:53:53.539 --> 00:54:01.719
And I send a particle here with
the velocity like this.

00:54:01.719 --> 00:54:05.710
What will it do?
 

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:09.510
So B is coming towards
me.

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:10.199
B is here.
 

00:54:10.199 --> 00:54:12.480
v x B is a force
in this direction.

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:15.590
It will bend;
it will go there.

00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:18.527
So it's constantly being
applied a force perpendicular to

00:54:18.527 --> 00:54:20.940
its velocity,
so it's like planetary motion.

00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:26.170
It will go in a circle.
 

00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:28.860
Never speeding up.
 

00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:30.963
It's not speeding up,
because the force is always

00:54:30.963 --> 00:54:32.190
perpendicular to velocity.
 

00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:35.409
You don't change the kinetic
energy, but you change the

00:54:35.409 --> 00:54:37.139
actual direction of motion.
 

00:54:37.139 --> 00:54:38.730
So this is the way to trap a
particle.

00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:41.244
If you want to trap particles,
you put them in a magnetic

00:54:41.244 --> 00:54:42.949
field, you don't have to touch
them.

00:54:42.949 --> 00:54:44.199
They will not go anywhere.
 

00:54:44.199 --> 00:54:48.250
They'll form an orbit.
 

00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:51.639
So let's find out what we can
say about this orbit.

00:54:51.639 --> 00:54:56.344
If that distance is R,
the dynamical equation is

00:54:56.344 --> 00:54:59.844
mv^(2)/R,
is the force you need to bend

00:54:59.844 --> 00:55:02.710
something into a circle of
radius R,

00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:05.219
if it's going at speed v.
 

00:55:05.219 --> 00:55:08.038
And we can take V to be
constant, because v is

00:55:08.038 --> 00:55:09.090
not going to change.
 

00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:13.768
And that's going to be equal to
the magnetic force,

00:55:13.768 --> 00:55:18.449
which is v times
B times q.

00:55:18.449 --> 00:55:20.719
I didn't write the cross
product, because everything is

00:55:20.719 --> 00:55:21.980
perpendicular to everything.
 

00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:23.898
The magnetic field and v are
perpendicular,

00:55:23.898 --> 00:55:26.456
so the cross product and
magnitude is just v times

00:55:26.456 --> 00:55:27.050
B.
 

00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:30.518
The direction of the force is
of course towards the center.

00:55:30.518 --> 00:55:37.152
If you balance these two
equations, you find

00:55:37.152 --> 00:55:43.630
v/R is
qB/m.

00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:45.199
So what is v/R?
 

00:55:45.199 --> 00:55:49.750
Let's look at what's v
over R.

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:57.766
If the particle has a velocity
v, the time period due in

00:55:57.766 --> 00:56:02.809
orbit will be
2Î R/v.

00:56:02.809 --> 00:56:07.130
The distance divided by speed
is the time period.

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:15.340
So v/R = 2Î /T
or 2Î f.

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:18.940
That's called the omega or the
angular speed.

00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:23.614
It goes around and around the
circle with an angular speed,

00:56:23.614 --> 00:56:24.420
Ï‰.
 

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:34.960
So v/R = Ï‰.
 

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.860
So this fact was known for some
time.

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:39.489
It's not very hard to find.
 

00:56:39.489 --> 00:56:44.768
But do you know who made a
living out of this?

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:47.010
Notice something very
interesting.

00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:52.804
The angular frequency does not
depend on the speed or on the

00:56:52.804 --> 00:56:53.690
radius.
 

00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:57.811
It just depends on the charge
to mass ratio of the particle in

00:56:57.811 --> 00:56:59.500
a given magnetic field.
 

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.929
So that circle,
that circle,

00:57:01.929 --> 00:57:05.349
they all go around at the same
rate.

00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:07.429
As long as the particle has a
given charge,

00:57:07.429 --> 00:57:09.570
a given mass,
it's in a given magnetic field,

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:12.269
you can launch them in orbits
of various velocities,

00:57:12.269 --> 00:57:16.550
they will all be in synch.
 

00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:19.079
Now do you know who used this?
 

00:57:19.079 --> 00:57:26.050
Does it look like anything,
these guys?

00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:32.050
That person was actually
associated with Yale.

00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:34.909
That tell you anything?
 

00:57:34.909 --> 00:57:37.239
Okay, his name was Lawrence.
 

00:57:37.239 --> 00:57:40.639
Do you know what Lawrence
invented?

00:57:40.639 --> 00:57:43.159
No?
 

00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:44.309
Pardon me?
 

00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:46.949
He invented the cyclotron.
 

00:57:46.949 --> 00:57:50.510
I'll tell you what--in fact,
he had the ideas when he was a

00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:54.010
young faculty member here,
but he didn't build it here.

00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:57.050
He went off to Berkeley and he
built the cyclotron there.

00:57:57.050 --> 00:57:59.309
Then he built bigger and bigger
cyclotrons.

00:57:59.309 --> 00:58:04.019
And I want to tell you what the
idea is behind a cyclotron.

00:58:04.019 --> 00:58:05.280
Here's what you want to do.
 

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:08.271
You want to accelerate
particles so you can smash them

00:58:08.271 --> 00:58:09.570
against other things.
 

00:58:09.570 --> 00:58:15.467
So one thing you can do is you
can take a little battery here,

00:58:15.467 --> 00:58:18.079
connect it to two plates.
 

00:58:18.079 --> 00:58:21.639
This is positive,
this is negative.

00:58:21.639 --> 00:58:25.166
If you release a proton here,
for example,

00:58:25.166 --> 00:58:28.090
it will fall down the
potential.

00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:32.369
So it will lose a potential
energy, q times V.

00:58:32.369 --> 00:58:34.768
That will turn into
Â½Mv^(2).

00:58:34.768 --> 00:58:36.329
And just when it hits the
bottom plate,

00:58:36.329 --> 00:58:39.054
if you have a hole there,
it'll go through the hole and

00:58:39.054 --> 00:58:42.083
you have a particle accelerator
whose output velocity will be

00:58:42.083 --> 00:58:47.030
v,
given by this equation.

00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:51.123
But now if you want to
accelerate it to a higher and

00:58:51.123 --> 00:58:54.655
higher energies,
you've got to get bigger and

00:58:54.655 --> 00:58:56.179
bigger voltage.
 

00:58:56.179 --> 00:58:58.840
So how are we going to do that?
 

00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:01.539
Here's what Lawrence did.
 

00:59:01.539 --> 00:59:04.730
So take a magnetic field.
 

00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:08.751
In fact, there are two metallic
halves called Ds,

00:59:08.751 --> 00:59:11.018
because of the way they look.
 

00:59:11.018 --> 00:59:15.449
You send a particle here and at
the instant you release it,

00:59:15.449 --> 00:59:17.797
imagine that this plate is
positive and this plate is

00:59:17.797 --> 00:59:20.023
negative,
and the particle is positively

00:59:20.023 --> 00:59:20.530
charged.
 

00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:23.353
That means the whole plate has
one potential,

00:59:23.353 --> 00:59:26.369
and the other plate has a
negative potential.

00:59:26.369 --> 00:59:32.260
So this particle will speed up
when it comes here.

00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:34.713
Now the whole thing is immersed
in a magnetic field,

00:59:34.713 --> 00:59:36.059
which I'm not showing you.
 

00:59:36.059 --> 00:59:42.030
So this guy will bend and come
out of this side.

00:59:42.030 --> 00:59:45.539
Now what will happen to it?
 

00:59:45.539 --> 00:59:49.250
What will it do now?
 

00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:50.994
If you don't do anything,
what will happen to the

00:59:50.994 --> 00:59:51.539
particle now?
 

00:59:51.539 --> 00:59:53.159
Student:  It will slow
down.

00:59:53.159 --> 00:59:55.489
Prof: It will slow down,
so that's not the accelerator.

00:59:55.489 --> 00:59:58.219
You've got one gain and
immediately lost it.

00:59:58.219 --> 01:00:02.960
But suppose when it's here,
you very cleverly change the

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.599
polarity of this?
 

01:00:04.599 --> 01:00:07.844
Just when it's leaving this
hole and going to the other

01:00:07.844 --> 01:00:11.389
D, you change the
polarity, so it's falling again.

01:00:11.389 --> 01:00:14.250
So it picks up a lot of speed
and goes on a bigger spiral.

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:19.487
Here is doesn't experience any
field, goes around and comes

01:00:19.487 --> 01:00:20.119
here.
 

01:00:20.119 --> 01:00:24.813
When it comes there,
you quietly change it one more

01:00:24.813 --> 01:00:28.570
time, so it's always falling
downhill.

01:00:28.570 --> 01:00:30.599
So every time it's ready to
cross the gap,

01:00:30.599 --> 01:00:31.739
you flip the voltage.
 

01:00:31.739 --> 01:00:33.429
How do you do that?
 

01:00:33.429 --> 01:00:36.085
You're not going to stand there
with the battery and keep

01:00:36.085 --> 01:00:37.460
switching the wires,
right?

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:38.909
So what do you think you do?
 

01:00:38.909 --> 01:00:43.010
Student:  Alternating
current?

01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:44.768
Prof: Put an alternating
voltage.

01:00:44.768 --> 01:00:49.588
Take the power supply from your
house, 60 cycle a second,

01:00:49.588 --> 01:00:53.976
denoted by this symbol,
AC voltage, will reverse its

01:00:53.976 --> 01:00:56.300
polarity automatically.
 

01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:00.306
And the beauty of this process
is the following:

01:01:00.306 --> 01:01:03.460
once it's got a certain
frequency,

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:07.094
it will produce a cyclotron
orbit whose omega matches that

01:01:07.094 --> 01:01:07.860
frequency.
 

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:09.239
Even though the particle is
speeding up--

01:01:09.239 --> 01:01:12.773
here's the whole point--even
though the particle is speeding

01:01:12.773 --> 01:01:16.514
up and going in bigger circles,
the ratio of the speed to the

01:01:16.514 --> 01:01:20.039
radius is such that it takes the
same time to go around these

01:01:20.039 --> 01:01:22.228
semicircles,
no matter how big they are,

01:01:22.228 --> 01:01:24.170
no matter how fast the
particle's moving.

01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:28.048
It's the fact that v
over R does not depend on

01:01:28.048 --> 01:01:30.219
R, R on v.
 

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:33.670
So that's the omega that you
will take for this guy.

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:37.034
Then it will keep on picking up
speed and at the very end,

01:01:37.034 --> 01:01:40.043
it will do a few more such
things, then it will come

01:01:40.043 --> 01:01:41.518
shooting out of here.
 

01:01:41.518 --> 01:01:43.666
So you don't need--in the end,
you can get 1 million volts,

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:45.369
but you don't have a 1 million
volt battery.

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:47.260
You have a 1 volt battery.
 

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:49.449
It gives it a kick a million
times.

01:01:49.449 --> 01:01:50.989
A million times you cross the
midpoint.

01:01:50.989 --> 01:01:55.860
It's a very clever way to make
the particle accelerate.

01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:59.260
The Stanford linear accelerator
is somewhat different.

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:03.039
There you have a lot of
cylinders and charged particles

01:02:03.039 --> 01:02:04.929
go from one to the other.
 

01:02:04.929 --> 01:02:07.548
But once again,
the polarity is reversed,

01:02:07.548 --> 01:02:10.887
so every time it goes there,
it's constantly falling

01:02:10.887 --> 01:02:11.739
downhill.
 

01:02:11.739 --> 01:02:15.641
It's just this thing taken out
and made into a straight line,

01:02:15.641 --> 01:02:19.090
that's about two miles long,
I think, in Palo Alto.

01:02:19.090 --> 01:02:22.634
And that was the machine that
discovered a lot of great

01:02:22.634 --> 01:02:25.849
things, including what's called
the J particle.

01:02:25.849 --> 01:02:30.610
So the linear accelerator's
one, but this is the cyclotron.

01:02:30.610 --> 01:02:36.934
So the next question you want
to ask is--these are all

01:02:36.934 --> 01:02:43.974
examples of forces on a single
charge--what's the force on a

01:02:43.974 --> 01:02:45.050
wire?
 

01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:49.420
Sometimes you do microscopic
experiments with tiny particles.

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:53.268
Other times you do macroscopic
experiments with wires carrying

01:02:53.268 --> 01:02:53.900
current.
 

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:55.268
So I want to look at that
problem.

01:02:55.268 --> 01:03:04.510
So let's look at the wire
carrying current.

01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:09.139
So here's a piece of wire,
and I want to find just a

01:03:09.139 --> 01:03:12.588
little segment,
which I write as vector

01:03:12.588 --> 01:03:13.860
dl.
 

01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:17.010
There's some current going here
and the whole thing is bathed in

01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:19.860
a magnetic field B,
which is constant over the tiny

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:20.460
segment.
 

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:23.469
We want to know what's the
force on the little segment.

01:03:23.469 --> 01:03:25.382
There's going to be a force
because there are guys moving in

01:03:25.382 --> 01:03:25.739
the wire.
 

01:03:25.739 --> 01:03:26.650
That's it.
 

01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:28.519
Each one feels a v x
B force.

01:03:28.519 --> 01:03:31.940
You've got to add it up.
 

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:35.391
So if this has got length
dl, how many charges am I

01:03:35.391 --> 01:03:36.360
talking about?
 

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:40.144
The number of charges is the
density of carriers times the

01:03:40.144 --> 01:03:41.539
charge of each one.
 

01:03:41.539 --> 01:03:44.929
That's the number of charges,
per unit volume.

01:03:44.929 --> 01:03:47.724
If the cross section of the
wire is A,

01:03:47.724 --> 01:03:50.965
the length is dl,
that's how many charges are

01:03:50.965 --> 01:03:52.110
involved here.
 

01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:53.170
Do you understand?
 

01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:55.280
This cross section is A.
 

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:58.260
A times dl is the
volume of the cylinder.

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.405
That times the number per
volume times the charge for each

01:04:01.405 --> 01:04:02.840
guy is the total charge.
 

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:10.697
And each one of them
experiences the force v x

01:04:10.697 --> 01:04:12.360
B.
 

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.989
Now I'm going to do a little
switch here.

01:04:13.989 --> 01:04:20.155
I'm going to write it as
Anev dl x

01:04:20.155 --> 01:04:21.599
B.
 

01:04:21.599 --> 01:04:23.550
So you see if you follow that.
 

01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:27.018
The velocity of the carriers is
along the wire.

01:04:27.018 --> 01:04:29.480
dl is also along the
wire.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.248
Therefore either you can take
the magnitude of this vector

01:04:32.248 --> 01:04:34.775
times the vector v,
or the magnitude of vector

01:04:34.775 --> 01:04:36.380
v times the dl.
 

01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:37.449
It's the same thing.
 

01:04:37.449 --> 01:04:40.809
They're both the vector
parallel to either one.

01:04:40.809 --> 01:04:44.875
But if you write it this way,
if you go back to what we did

01:04:44.875 --> 01:04:48.239
earlier, this is just the
current in the wire.

01:04:48.239 --> 01:04:53.971
So we have a nice formula that
says the force on a segment of

01:04:53.971 --> 01:04:59.608
wire carrying current I
is I times dl x

01:04:59.608 --> 01:05:00.849
B.
 

01:05:00.849 --> 01:05:01.768
So here's an example.
 

01:05:01.768 --> 01:05:05.489
Suppose you've got a magnetic
field like this.

01:05:05.489 --> 01:05:06.409
And I've got a wire.
 

01:05:06.409 --> 01:05:08.108
I don't know where it's coming
from, I don't know where it's

01:05:08.108 --> 01:05:08.340
going.
 

01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:10.940
Let's say it's just carrying a
current.

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:14.000
And imagine this is in the real
vertical plane,

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.260
so that there are some weights
hanging from it.

01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:19.329
It's trying to fall down.
 

01:05:19.329 --> 01:05:24.585
You can balance that by
applying a force of magnetism to

01:05:24.585 --> 01:05:29.936
that wire, because the magnetic
force will be dl x

01:05:29.936 --> 01:05:31.179
B.
 

01:05:31.179 --> 01:05:35.802
Let's see, so dl is this
way, B is out of the

01:05:35.802 --> 01:05:39.389
board, so let me set the current
like this.

01:05:39.389 --> 01:05:45.753
Then dl is this way,
cross B will be a force

01:05:45.753 --> 01:05:46.869
upwards.
 

01:05:46.869 --> 01:05:50.802
There'll be an upward force of
B times the length of the

01:05:50.802 --> 01:05:52.389
wire times the current.
 

01:05:52.389 --> 01:05:55.409
And if that's equal to the mass
of the wire times g,

01:05:55.409 --> 01:05:57.389
then the wire won't fall up or
down;

01:05:57.389 --> 01:06:00.268
it will just stay there.
 

01:06:00.268 --> 01:06:03.313
So you can hold up a piece of
wire by driving a current

01:06:03.313 --> 01:06:05.849
through it and putting in a
magnetic field.

01:06:05.849 --> 01:06:08.891
But here's another simple
homework problem,

01:06:08.891 --> 01:06:12.150
or some problem you can find in
a textbook.

01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:15.099
This is a semicircular wire.
 

01:06:15.099 --> 01:06:18.038
Now this wire cannot just start
and end here because the current

01:06:18.038 --> 01:06:20.277
has to come from somewhere and
go from somewhere,

01:06:20.277 --> 01:06:21.630
so maybe it's doing this.
 

01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:25.280
But I'm just focusing on this
section.

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:29.719
And imagine there is a magnetic
field going like this.

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:31.789
I want to find the force on the
semicircle.

01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:33.530
This is supposed to be a
semicircle.

01:06:33.530 --> 01:06:38.179
What's the force on it?
 

01:06:38.179 --> 01:06:40.809
So take a portion of the wire
here.

01:06:40.809 --> 01:06:42.960
This is my dl.
 

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.340
This is my B.
 

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:46.219
Take the cross product of dl
with B.

01:06:46.219 --> 01:06:48.090
Can you see which way it will
go?

01:06:48.090 --> 01:06:50.789
Do the old screwdriver,
your favorite thing.

01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:51.849
Do this.
 

01:06:51.849 --> 01:06:56.500
It's coming out of the
blackboard.

01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:00.630
And what's the force that's
coming out of the blackboard due

01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:04.969
to the little section = I
times dl times B

01:07:04.969 --> 01:07:07.630
times the angle between these
two.

01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:11.090
And that will turn out to be a
sine theta.

01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:13.775
If you want,
you can measure theta from here

01:07:13.775 --> 01:07:16.710
and you can see that dl
is like that,

01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:19.557
B is like that,
and the angle between the

01:07:19.557 --> 01:07:23.255
horizontal and the radial is the
same as the angle between the

01:07:23.255 --> 01:07:26.588
perpendicular to the radial and
the perpendicular to the

01:07:26.588 --> 01:07:27.619
horizontal.
 

01:07:27.619 --> 01:07:30.570
So this theta is the same as
that theta.

01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:36.018
Then you integrate the force,
you get I.

01:07:36.018 --> 01:07:39.891
dl will be just
2Î R,

01:07:39.891 --> 01:07:41.719
times B.
 

01:07:41.719 --> 01:07:45.710
Sorry, dl will be
Î R time B,

01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:49.083
times integral of
sinÎ¸

01:07:49.083 --> 01:07:53.701
dÎ¸,
which is -cosÎ¸

01:07:53.701 --> 01:08:02.409
from 0 to Î ,
that will give you a 2.

01:08:02.409 --> 01:08:07.559
So that will be the force
coming out of the blackboard on

01:08:07.559 --> 01:08:08.940
this section.
 

01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:24.210
I should say theta from 0 to
Î .

01:08:24.210 --> 01:08:26.880
I think there's something wrong
with this formula.

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.970
Hold on for a second, guys.
 

01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:30.939
It should not be done this way.
 

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:36.380
dl = RdÎ¸.
 

01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:42.136
There's I times B
and RdÎ¸

01:08:42.136 --> 01:08:48.344
sinÎ¸ from 0 to
Î , and that will give you

01:08:48.344 --> 01:08:50.149
2IBR.
 

01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:52.990
Do you understand that the
length of the wire,

01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:55.516
this segment dl,
is R times

01:08:55.516 --> 01:08:56.779
dÎ¸.
 

01:08:56.779 --> 01:08:59.670
Theta is measured in radians.
 

01:08:59.670 --> 01:09:07.045
Anyway that is a force and this
section tells you how to

01:09:07.045 --> 01:09:10.130
calculate that force.
 

01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:13.287
All right, the last thing which
I will start but which I will

01:09:13.287 --> 01:09:16.188
not finish today,
and you can try to look at some

01:09:16.188 --> 01:09:19.170
good pictures before you come to
class next time.

01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:21.970
There is just no way I can get
this right.

01:09:21.970 --> 01:09:25.409
So here is a current loop.
 

01:09:25.409 --> 01:09:28.930
And the current goes like this.
 

01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:32.328
And it's in a magnetic field
like this.

01:09:32.328 --> 01:09:37.470
The question is,
what happens to it?

01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:40.796
So you've got to go to the four
sides of the loop,

01:09:40.796 --> 01:09:44.737
in this side the v x
B, your current is going

01:09:44.737 --> 01:09:45.619
this way.
 

01:09:45.619 --> 01:09:46.840
B is going straight up.
 

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:48.868
v x B will act
like this.

01:09:48.868 --> 01:09:50.649
There the v x B
will act like this.

01:09:50.649 --> 01:09:55.640
Here it will act like this and
here it will act like this.

01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:01.189
And this is the normal to the
plane, it's the area vector.

01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:04.095
So let me draw you a side view,
because that's the only thing I

01:10:04.095 --> 01:10:05.078
can even try to do.
 

01:10:05.078 --> 01:10:09.408
In the side view,
it looks like this.

01:10:09.408 --> 01:10:12.979
These two edges are getting
pulled.

01:10:12.979 --> 01:10:15.673
This edge that you can see here
is getting pulled out of the

01:10:15.673 --> 01:10:16.038
board.
 

01:10:16.038 --> 01:10:18.220
The other one's getting pulled
away from the board.

01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:20.916
They just try to distort the
loop, but they cancel each other

01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:22.220
and they don't do anything.
 

01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:26.658
But these two are equal as
forces, but as a torque,

01:10:26.658 --> 01:10:31.630
they are not equal and
opposite, but they're additive.

01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:35.315
So they together produce a
torque and let's find out what

01:10:35.315 --> 01:10:36.368
the torque is.
 

01:10:36.368 --> 01:10:40.353
The force on this segment is
B times l times

01:10:40.353 --> 01:10:42.800
I, where l is
this.

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:45.962
Let the other dimension be
w, which stands for

01:10:45.962 --> 01:10:46.449
width.
 

01:10:46.449 --> 01:10:48.908
This is w here.
 

01:10:48.908 --> 01:10:55.439
Then the torque will be that
times wsinÎ¸.

01:10:55.439 --> 01:11:00.100
That is the torque.
 

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:04.109
But l times w is
the area of the loop.

01:11:04.109 --> 01:11:07.939
B times A times
sinÎ¸.

01:11:07.939 --> 01:11:10.770
If I represent the area as a
vector,

01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:15.743
pointing on this direction,
then the torque is simply given

01:11:15.743 --> 01:11:20.414
by Î¼ x B,
where Î¼ is a vector

01:11:20.414 --> 01:11:25.239
whose magnitude is equal to the
current in the loop times area.

01:11:25.239 --> 01:11:30.520
I forgot the I.
 

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:37.538
And this is called the magnetic
moment of the loop.

01:11:37.538 --> 01:11:40.215
You call it a magnetic moment,
because it's just like a dipole

01:11:40.215 --> 01:11:40.609
moment.
 

01:11:40.609 --> 01:11:42.649
You might remember,
if I take a dipole,

01:11:42.649 --> 01:11:46.430
put it in a field,
the torque on it is p x

01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:51.078
E and the energy of it is
-pâ‹…E.

01:11:51.078 --> 01:11:55.470
So magnetic loop looks like a
dipole in a magnetic field.

01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:58.938
In other words,
if there were magnetic charges

01:11:58.938 --> 01:12:01.465
in nature,
which there aren't,

01:12:01.465 --> 01:12:06.201
then this guy behaves exactly
like a magnetic charge and a -

01:12:06.201 --> 01:12:08.850
on the other side of the loop.
 

01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:12.457
So if magnetic charges existed,
this would be simply a magnetic

01:12:12.457 --> 01:12:14.034
dipole,
aligning itself with the

01:12:14.034 --> 01:12:15.686
magnetic field,
but in reality,

01:12:15.686 --> 01:12:17.520
there are no magnetic poles.
 

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:21.050
But there is just the loop that
behaves like a dipole.

01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:24.631
And the dipole moment of the
loop, which is the analog of

01:12:24.631 --> 01:12:28.340
distance times the charge is the
current times the area.

01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:30.979
So we'll take it from here next
time.

01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:36.000

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:08.703
Prof: As we approach the
episode of Camacho's wedding it

00:00:08.703 --> 00:00:13.550
should be readily apparent that
it was--

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.370
the story was going to be a
play.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.895
It has a beginning,
a conflict or climax,

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:21.570
and a resolution.
 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.380
Given that it has a happy
ending its safe to assume that

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.550
it was going to be a comedy.
 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.987
Actually, scholars have
ferreted around and discovered

00:00:34.987 --> 00:00:38.336
evidence that,
indeed, it was a play that

00:00:38.336 --> 00:00:41.350
Cervantes was planning to write.
 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.446
And Cervantes,
it seems, found in the

00:00:45.446 --> 00:00:51.329
Quixote a book where he
could sort of dump all of his

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.177
work in progress,
the stories,

00:00:55.177 --> 00:00:59.152
some of which wound up,
of course, in the book

00:00:59.152 --> 00:01:02.320
Exemplary Stories,
but some of the stories in the

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.584
book,
of course, were written

00:01:04.584 --> 00:01:08.909
independently and had actually
circulated independently.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.680
The novel, as it is being
developed in the Quixote,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.930
will be an inclusive kind of
literary work,

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.104
with a lose format,
not following the strict rules

00:01:26.104 --> 00:01:31.453
of literary forms,
genres, derived from the

00:01:31.453 --> 00:01:38.550
classical tradition where these
liberties were not available,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.141
but the Quixote does
allow for this kind of

00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:47.640
incorporation of stories and of
various texts.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.244
It is a feature that the novel
will continue to have and that

00:01:53.244 --> 00:01:58.101
in the modern period,
of course, will be exploited to

00:01:58.101 --> 00:01:59.970
the very limits.
 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:08.062
Let us also notice how this
love story is neatly integrated

00:02:08.062 --> 00:02:14.330
into the plot of the novel,
as opposed to the more

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.722
tangential way in which such
stories were inserted in Part

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:20.288
II.
 

00:02:20.288 --> 00:02:25.555
Here, Don Quixote and Sancho
are more or less involved in the

00:02:25.555 --> 00:02:29.151
developments,
and certainly Don Quixote is

00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:31.610
involved in the outcome.
 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.080
Of course, given that this was
going to be a play,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.637
there is a great deal of
theatricality in the whole

00:02:39.637 --> 00:02:42.991
episode,
which includes theater within

00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:47.247
the theater as these
celebrations for the wedding

00:02:47.247 --> 00:02:48.490
take place.
 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.180
Even nature has been
artistically arranged,

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.430
so much so, that the outdoors
now has a roof.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.371
You may recall that,
when they enter the meadow

00:03:01.371 --> 00:03:05.400
where the celebration of the
wedding is going to take place,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.028
it is noted that the trees have
been arranged in such a way as

00:03:12.028 --> 00:03:18.657
to provide a canopy that the sun
can barely penetrate to reach

00:03:18.657 --> 00:03:20.180
the grass.
 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.653
That is, is nature turned into
architecture,

00:03:25.653 --> 00:03:27.310
as it were.
 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.635
The play within the play is a
way of underlining that

00:03:34.635 --> 00:03:41.485
everything is theatrical;
that there is no real action

00:03:41.485 --> 00:03:44.639
that is not already theater.
 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.348
That is, life is already
theater in Part II,

00:03:48.348 --> 00:03:52.532
and this is part of the theme
of desengaño that

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:56.160
I have been underlining for the
past few lectures.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.689
Let us also take notice of the
abundance that prevails here and

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:07.640
in the second part,
in general, in contrast with

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.800
Part I.
 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.312
Whereas, in Part I,
the characters ate frugally,

00:04:13.312 --> 00:04:18.495
now Sancho has so much food
before him that he scarcely

00:04:18.495 --> 00:04:21.278
knows what to do with it.
 

00:04:21.278 --> 00:04:27.485
Compare this with the very
frugal meal that Don Quixote had

00:04:27.485 --> 00:04:33.262
at that very first inn,
when he ate fish because it was

00:04:33.262 --> 00:04:34.440
Friday.
 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.913
Abundance, contrasted with the
starkest want is typical of the

00:04:38.913 --> 00:04:45.132
aesthetics of the Baroque,
this clash, and abundance ties

00:04:45.132 --> 00:04:49.910
in with the notion of
sensuality,

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.406
the sensuality of Cervantes's
art that Auerbach spoke about in

00:04:54.406 --> 00:04:57.060
the essay that you have all
read,

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.360
and that he says is the
hallmark of Cervantes' work.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.687
The sensual,
the tangible,

00:05:04.687 --> 00:05:09.156
in all its abundance,
turns into a simulacrum and

00:05:09.156 --> 00:05:14.370
reveals its opposite,
which is quite literary death.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.610
This is the
desengaño aspect.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.562
So we have Sancho's speech
about death being the devourer

00:05:24.562 --> 00:05:25.680
of all.
 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.857
As I said, the overarching plot
and the plot within the work in

00:05:30.857 --> 00:05:35.617
these stories follows this
pattern of engaño

00:05:35.617 --> 00:05:38.290
and desengaño.
 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:44.529
Now, we may ask when we come to
this episode,

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:49.060
why are weddings so important
in fiction,

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.879
including film,
of course, the theater too,

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:56.110
but in film,
there are many films that you,

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:02.778
I'm sure, can remember,
that center on a wedding.

00:06:02.778 --> 00:06:09.389
Weddings mark a moment of
social union and renewal,

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:13.620
both of society and of nature.
 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.781
They are a transition marked by
feasting, particularly,

00:06:18.781 --> 00:06:19.930
by eating.
 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:26.024
In fiction, weddings tend to be
conclusions: 'they married and

00:06:26.024 --> 00:06:32.319
lived happily ever after,' is a
common and traditional ending to

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:33.519
stories.
 

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:42.182
In the wedding celebrations the
world is consumed in a way that

00:06:42.182 --> 00:06:48.329
leads to the consummation of the
marriage.

00:06:48.329 --> 00:06:54.166
The story--and we will see much
more about this in a very short

00:06:54.166 --> 00:06:57.053
time--
the story of Camacho's wedding,

00:06:57.053 --> 00:07:01.600
like the myth of Pyramus and
Thisbe on which it is based,

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:07.160
is a conjunction of love and
death of Eros and Thanatos,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:13.149
or love that struggles against
death for continuity and

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:14.259
renewal.
 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:19.129
There are intimations of the
death scene,

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:24.105
the culminating death scene,
which is really not a death

00:07:24.105 --> 00:07:27.838
scene,
but a contrived theatrical

00:07:27.838 --> 00:07:31.483
death scene,
but there are intimations of

00:07:31.483 --> 00:07:35.634
that death scene in the calf
that is impaled to be cooked

00:07:35.634 --> 00:07:39.709
that our protagonists find as
they arrive at the wedding

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:40.970
celebration.
 

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:47.629
One could also see in that
impaled calf a scapegoat,

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:54.029
which is typical of feasts and
of celebrations.

00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:58.184
Now, Camacho is rich and
powerful like Don Fernando in

00:07:58.184 --> 00:07:58.889
Part I.
 

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:05.646
But Basilio's abilities and
skills prevail over social and

00:08:05.646 --> 00:08:07.778
economic forces.
 

00:08:07.778 --> 00:08:16.209
His industria,
his abilities win the day,

00:08:16.209 --> 00:08:19.850
and there is much made of how
many skills he has,

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:24.079
he can play the guitar,
he is an athlete,

00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:28.665
we later find out that he's
quite an actor,

00:08:28.665 --> 00:08:29.430
also.
 

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:34.700
Now, the episode is a prose
epithalamium,

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:42.320
and I think better write
this--a poem or song in praise

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:48.389
of the bride or groom or both
from the Greek

00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:53.751
"epi,"
"at,"

00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:58.268
and
"thalamium,"

00:08:58.268 --> 00:09:05.802
"nuptial chamber"--
and a verse epithalamium is

00:09:05.802 --> 00:09:10.600
actually performed as part of
the wedding celebration,

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.110
if you remember,
quite an elaborate one at that.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:23.149
This episode of a wedding with
such celebrations is common in

00:09:23.149 --> 00:09:30.714
the literature of the period;
the most prominent one is in

00:09:30.714 --> 00:09:35.158
the great poem by Luis de
Góngora,

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:37.399
whose name I may not have
mentioned before,

00:09:37.399 --> 00:09:44.620
who is the great Baroque poet;
it is from him that you get the

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.586
word in English
"gongoristic"

00:09:47.586 --> 00:09:51.178
as something very baroque and
complicated,

00:09:51.178 --> 00:09:55.721
and he is famous for many
poems, but the most famous one

00:09:55.721 --> 00:10:02.191
is called the Soledades,
and in the Soledades

00:10:02.191 --> 00:10:09.106
there is quite an elaborate
wedding ceremony that is

00:10:09.106 --> 00:10:10.870
described.
 

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:17.600
It is like a spring ritual,
a celebration of nature's

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:25.236
replenishment--remember that
Part II, vaguely begins sort of

00:10:25.236 --> 00:10:27.048
in spring.
 

00:10:27.048 --> 00:10:32.144
But in the whole episode one
wonders, is nature corrected by

00:10:32.144 --> 00:10:34.649
art or does nature prevail?
 

00:10:34.649 --> 00:10:38.658
I think the answer is obvious
that art prevails.

00:10:38.658 --> 00:10:41.615
That art corrects nature,
and this is,

00:10:41.615 --> 00:10:45.530
again, one of the main themes
in Part II of the

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:46.808
Quixote.
 

00:10:46.808 --> 00:10:53.418
Don Quixote is on the side of
Basilio,

00:10:53.418 --> 00:10:58.279
not of Camacho and in this the
episode is very remindful of

00:10:58.279 --> 00:11:02.220
Marcela's and
Grisóstomo's in Part I,

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.780
when Don Quixote,
again, is on the side of

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.649
Marcela.
 

00:11:06.649 --> 00:11:12.538
Perhaps this episode is the
kind of ending that the

00:11:12.538 --> 00:11:19.134
Marcela-Grisóstomo
episode should have had in Part

00:11:19.134 --> 00:11:21.966
I,
the reminiscences of that

00:11:21.966 --> 00:11:25.899
episode also in the attempted or
faked suicide,

00:11:25.899 --> 00:11:30.263
in Part I Grisóstomo,
as we saw, had actually

00:11:30.263 --> 00:11:31.720
committed suicide.
 

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.692
Now, the story's a version of
the myth of Pyramus and

00:11:34.692 --> 00:11:38.605
Thisbe,
which had been anticipated by

00:11:38.605 --> 00:11:45.244
Lorenzo de Miranda's sonnet on
the topic during the episode at

00:11:45.244 --> 00:11:49.500
Diego de Miranda's house,
his father's house,

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.619
the man in green,
and it's mentioned directly by

00:11:53.619 --> 00:11:58.450
one of the students on the road
to the wedding.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:03.278
It is also acted out in the
danza hablada,

00:12:03.278 --> 00:12:06.698
the spoken dance,
the epithalamium,

00:12:06.698 --> 00:12:10.220
during the wedding festivities.
 

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:14.383
So the myth of Pyramus and
Thisbe hangs heavily over

00:12:14.383 --> 00:12:15.460
this episode.
 

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:20.846
John Sinnegan writes, quote:
"The occurrence of the

00:12:20.846 --> 00:12:23.214
ceremony in a theater [theater
like]

00:12:23.214 --> 00:12:26.798
implies that the wedding is but
one more artifice.

00:12:26.798 --> 00:12:31.980
Therefore, when Basilio appears
we become caught up with the

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.440
spectators at the wedding.
 

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.268
They, like the audience at the
play were 'suspensos

00:12:37.268 --> 00:12:40.308
esperando,' [they were
waiting in suspense to see what

00:12:40.308 --> 00:12:41.269
would happen].
 

00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:45.681
The heralded star of the play
has just stepped on stage and

00:12:45.681 --> 00:12:49.558
everyone is anxious to see what
he will do."

00:12:49.558 --> 00:12:53.889
Sinnegan adds,
comparing this episode,

00:12:53.889 --> 00:12:58.763
which is the only one on love
on the second part with the

00:12:58.763 --> 00:13:03.908
Cardenio tale of the first part,
and he writes the following.

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:08.712
This is rather a lengthy quote,
but I think a useful quote from

00:13:08.712 --> 00:13:10.340
this John Sinnegan.
 

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:14.749
It goes; "The final result
of the action of Camacho's

00:13:14.749 --> 00:13:19.390
wedding is the confirmation of
the propriety of romantic love

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:23.490
and the rejection of the
illegitimate claim on love by

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.418
greed.
 

00:13:24.418 --> 00:13:30.870
The same conclusion was
provided by Cardenio's tale.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.054
There are, however,
important differences between

00:13:34.054 --> 00:13:35.250
the two stories.
 

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:40.364
Cardenio's tale ends in an inn,
to which the hand of fate had

00:13:40.364 --> 00:13:44.908
led the two couples;
the Camacho wedding episode

00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:50.941
however ends in a stage and the
conclusion is brought about by

00:13:50.941 --> 00:13:52.820
Basilio's skill.
 

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.279
The difference between these
two endings reflects a

00:13:56.279 --> 00:13:59.879
significant difference between
Part I and Part II.

00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:04.971
In Part I, only Don Quixote and
the priest acted as authors in

00:14:04.971 --> 00:14:09.730
the sense that they tried to
impose fiction on reality.

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:13.528
The role of art was of
secondary concern to the other

00:14:13.528 --> 00:14:14.480
characters.
 

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.711
In Part II, however,
art and artifice are extremely

00:14:17.711 --> 00:14:20.750
important and a larger number of
characters,

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.788
from Sancho Panza to the Duke
and Duchess and,

00:14:23.788 --> 00:14:25.778
of course, Sansón
Carrasco,

00:14:25.778 --> 00:14:30.791
act as authors by using fiction
to impose their wills on other

00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:31.860
characters.
 

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:36.998
In Camacho's wedding Basilio
acts as author because he is not

00:14:36.998 --> 00:14:41.279
content to let fate decide the
end of the story.

00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:46.023
Therefore he imposes his will
on the other characters by using

00:14:46.023 --> 00:14:50.767
fiction to alter the course of
the story away from its natural

00:14:50.767 --> 00:14:51.778
ending."
 

00:14:51.778 --> 00:14:52.788
Unquote.
 

00:14:52.788 --> 00:14:58.019
He's the author but he's also
the actor of this play that he

00:14:58.019 --> 00:14:59.259
has made up.
 

00:14:59.259 --> 00:15:04.629
But another way to look at the
episode is to see it a modern

00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:10.182
version of the Pyramus and
Thisbe myth which is clearly

00:15:10.182 --> 00:15:14.937
in the background and looming,
as I've just said over the

00:15:14.937 --> 00:15:15.360
story.
 

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.547
The Pyramus and Thisbe
story in Ovid's

00:15:18.547 --> 00:15:23.038
Metamorphoses highlights
the pagan theme of suicide,

00:15:23.038 --> 00:15:26.548
which Cervantes,
in his Catholic environment,

00:15:26.548 --> 00:15:31.580
uses for dramatic effect but
ultimately avoids.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:37.490
Now, Ovid, we all know who he
was,

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:41.181
and I gave you some information
in the sheet that I passed

00:15:41.181 --> 00:15:43.900
around with the copy of this
episode in the

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:49.144
Metamorphoses;
he was a Roman poet of the last

00:15:49.144 --> 00:15:52.524
Augustan age,
he's known for his Ars

00:15:52.524 --> 00:15:55.389
Amatoria,
which someone called "the

00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:58.538
most immoral work written by a
man of genius,"

00:15:58.538 --> 00:16:02.981
it's on love--
don't rush out now to get the

00:16:02.981 --> 00:16:03.678
book.
 

00:16:03.678 --> 00:16:08.158
But the Metamorphoses is
his most important work,

00:16:08.158 --> 00:16:12.918
which is a long narrative poem,
book,

00:16:12.918 --> 00:16:20.424
which recounts legends in which
the miraculous transformations

00:16:20.424 --> 00:16:22.639
of matter occur.
 

00:16:22.639 --> 00:16:26.991
In fact, the poem begins:
"My intention is to tell

00:16:26.991 --> 00:16:30.620
of bodies changed to different
forms."

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:36.582
And it begins with the change
from chaos to cosmos,

00:16:36.582 --> 00:16:43.620
and goes on to the moment to
Julius Caesar being transformed

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.529
into a star.
 

00:16:45.529 --> 00:16:49.264
So the Middle Ages took the
Metamorphoses to be kind

00:16:49.264 --> 00:16:51.970
of a pagan bible,
like an old testament.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:57.178
If the Old Testament tells the
story of the universe,

00:16:57.178 --> 00:17:01.285
so does the
Metamorphoses using the

00:17:01.285 --> 00:17:03.288
classical myths.
 

00:17:03.288 --> 00:17:09.416
His influence in the
Renaissance was tremendous,

00:17:09.416 --> 00:17:13.980
and even in the late Middle
Ages.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:20.278
He was kind of the thesaurus of
myths that artists,

00:17:20.278 --> 00:17:25.569
both painters,
sculptures, and writers used

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:27.460
very often.
 

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:35.698
Now, in Spanish literature he
was very influential as he was,

00:17:35.698 --> 00:17:43.250
of course, in English
literature throughout the ages.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:53.806
He competes with Virgil in
importance as a classical author

00:17:53.806 --> 00:17:56.900
to be followed.
 

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:01.596
Now, there are deeper more
disturbing aspects in this

00:18:01.596 --> 00:18:06.423
story,
in Camacho's wedding linking

00:18:06.423 --> 00:18:09.909
deflowering,
blood and the connection

00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:14.288
between life and death,
into which I will go in some

00:18:14.288 --> 00:18:15.098
detail.
 

00:18:15.098 --> 00:18:19.650
Love appears as a mock death to
promote life.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:24.997
Violence and love are complicit
because violence is the subtext

00:18:24.997 --> 00:18:25.858
of love.
 

00:18:25.858 --> 00:18:32.336
The issue here is of classical
mythologies, version of this,

00:18:32.336 --> 00:18:36.400
contrasted with Christian
doctrine.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.690
The question for artists of the
Renaissance,

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.568
deeply interested in the
classical world,

00:18:42.568 --> 00:18:47.664
but living in a Christian one,
was what to do with the ancient

00:18:47.664 --> 00:18:48.250
gods.
 

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:53.558
The most common answer was
allegory;

00:18:53.558 --> 00:19:00.355
the myths were seen as moral
allegories, they told a moral

00:19:00.355 --> 00:19:01.190
tale.
 

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:06.272
But in the case of the episode
of Camacho's wedding what

00:19:06.272 --> 00:19:11.818
Cervantes seems to be proposing
is a modern reenactment of an

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:16.996
ancient reoccurring dilemma
concerning love and using for

00:19:16.996 --> 00:19:22.450
that the classical myth of
Pyramus and Thisbe.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:27.115
Basilio's arts are used here to
steer the story away from its

00:19:27.115 --> 00:19:31.742
pagan ending,
suicide, to a victory of love

00:19:31.742 --> 00:19:36.928
and Christian marriage--
you have read the story in the

00:19:36.928 --> 00:19:40.180
handout that I gave you in the
last class.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:45.857
The pagan ending is turned into
theater, into representation,

00:19:45.857 --> 00:19:46.900
into art.
 

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:51.538
Don Quixote has referred
earlier to marriage as an

00:19:51.538 --> 00:19:56.057
irreparable accident,
in something that sounds very

00:19:56.057 --> 00:20:00.578
funny to us today,
he is just using scholastic

00:20:00.578 --> 00:20:05.568
terminology to refer to it,
and always in the context of

00:20:05.568 --> 00:20:09.170
these debates about marriage
that I will revisit today.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:14.464
Basilio makes the accidental
the result of choice,

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:15.868
his choice.
 

00:20:15.868 --> 00:20:19.791
The point is that skill and
wiliness lead to a virtuous

00:20:19.791 --> 00:20:20.808
result here.
 

00:20:20.808 --> 00:20:25.807
The whole of the second part of
the Quixote is an apology

00:20:25.807 --> 00:20:27.903
for art,
for the artificial,

00:20:27.903 --> 00:20:30.691
for the constructed,
for the contrived,

00:20:30.691 --> 00:20:33.890
for art helping nature attend
good ends,

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:39.059
after going through the process
of desengaño that

00:20:39.059 --> 00:20:43.230
I have been underlining in the
past few classes.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:47.883
It is a way of turning deceit,
which would normally lead to

00:20:47.883 --> 00:20:51.252
disillusionment,
into a positive force that

00:20:51.252 --> 00:20:53.500
leads to a happy ending.
 

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:59.315
As I said, Basilio's skills
prevail over the economic

00:20:59.315 --> 00:21:03.900
forces, the social and economic
forces;

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.150
his craftiness wins the day.
 

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:13.880
Now, what I claim is beneath
all of that a kind of substory,

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.250
a subtext.
 

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:21.237
The story is a rewriting of the
love stories of Part I that turn

00:21:21.237 --> 00:21:26.463
on unequal marriage and that
involve the issue of secret

00:21:26.463 --> 00:21:29.173
marriages,
which, as I said,

00:21:29.173 --> 00:21:33.250
were the hot topic of the day
which was taken up by the

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.759
Council of Trent.
 

00:21:34.759 --> 00:21:38.857
Having read Elliott you know
now what the Council of Trent

00:21:38.857 --> 00:21:39.288
was.
 

00:21:39.288 --> 00:21:44.419
I spoke about these issues when
speaking about the episode in

00:21:44.419 --> 00:21:49.890
which Dorotea allows herself to
be deflowered by Don Fernando.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:54.977
The difference here is the
lurking presence of classical

00:21:54.977 --> 00:21:59.140
myth, typical,
more typical of the Baroque.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:05.428
In Part I the stories about all
of these young people seem to be

00:22:05.428 --> 00:22:09.618
drawn from contemporary legal
archives,

00:22:09.618 --> 00:22:14.601
contemporary stories about
conflicts involving social

00:22:14.601 --> 00:22:18.019
issues,
states and legacies.

00:22:18.019 --> 00:22:24.028
Here the source is much more
imposing and ancient,

00:22:24.028 --> 00:22:27.470
the myth of Pyramus and
Thisbe,

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:33.400
but true to the political
character of Part II there is,

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.615
in addition,
a protracted discussion of the

00:22:35.615 --> 00:22:37.618
issue of marriage by the
characters.

00:22:37.618 --> 00:22:40.361
The issue of marriage was a
political issue,

00:22:40.361 --> 00:22:44.018
not just a religious issue;
it's impossible to separate the

00:22:44.018 --> 00:22:44.308
two.
 

00:22:44.308 --> 00:22:50.118
Other echoes of Part I are
Basilio's madness,

00:22:50.118 --> 00:22:54.288
when he hears of Quiteria's
impending marriage,

00:22:54.288 --> 00:22:58.714
which recalls both
Grisóstomo and Cardenio

00:22:58.714 --> 00:23:02.661
when they go mad--
in the case of Cardenio mostly,

00:23:02.661 --> 00:23:06.390
we don't see Grisóstomo
actually act that out--

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.374
and, of course,
the issue of suicide which

00:23:09.374 --> 00:23:11.338
evokes Grisóstomo.
 

00:23:11.338 --> 00:23:13.780
This is another case,
I emphasize,

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.519
of rewriting episodes from Part
I,

00:23:16.519 --> 00:23:21.770
so the rewritings involve here
both episodes in Part I and

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:24.990
classical myth,
which is being rewritten.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:31.191
But there is a deeper take on
marriage at the level of

00:23:31.191 --> 00:23:34.348
material transformations.
 

00:23:34.348 --> 00:23:39.111
The story of Camacho's wedding
is about the issue of marriage

00:23:39.111 --> 00:23:44.113
as a sacrament,
a transformation of matter for

00:23:44.113 --> 00:23:49.696
transcendental purposes,
that of creating a new human

00:23:49.696 --> 00:23:54.049
life and how it is
institutionalized through civil

00:23:54.049 --> 00:23:58.165
and canon law,
that is, by society and

00:23:58.165 --> 00:23:59.259
religion.
 

00:23:59.259 --> 00:24:04.992
The law is based on
prohibition: 'thou shall not,'

00:24:04.992 --> 00:24:08.289
here,
the ban instituted by

00:24:08.289 --> 00:24:14.807
Quiteria's parents once she and
Basilio have reached sexual

00:24:14.807 --> 00:24:18.403
maturity,
which is quite evident,

00:24:18.403 --> 00:24:23.691
if you read the story their
prohibition comes up when they

00:24:23.691 --> 00:24:26.660
have reached sexual maturity.
 

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:30.594
She has begun to menstruate and
he is now capable of

00:24:30.594 --> 00:24:32.058
impregnating her.
 

00:24:32.058 --> 00:24:36.660
Her parents are reluctant to
have her reproduce with an

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.578
impecunious Basilio who,
for all of his skills,

00:24:40.578 --> 00:24:42.880
has no profitable ones.
 

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.337
But that stands also as does
simply the prohibition:

00:24:47.337 --> 00:24:49.000
'that shall not.'
 

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:56.220
As we saw when discussing the
issue regarding Dorotea,

00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:01.011
clandestine marriages--which is
lurking here in the background

00:25:01.011 --> 00:25:05.176
because we must assume that
there had been one between

00:25:05.176 --> 00:25:09.961
Basilio and Quiteria,
clandestine marriages could

00:25:09.961 --> 00:25:11.788
lead to polygamy.
 

00:25:11.788 --> 00:25:17.009
And I could say to any girl
that I was involved with,

00:25:17.009 --> 00:25:22.920
yes, yes, I will marry you,
and then if it took,

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:27.440
as it were, you could be
married to several such women.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:35.136
And also, how can a vow hastily
made in the heat of passion yoke

00:25:35.136 --> 00:25:40.880
partners for life in what Don
Quixote calls,

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.930
again using scholastic
terminology,

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.155
"un accidente
irreparable,"

00:25:45.155 --> 00:25:47.588
meaning something that cannot
be taken back,

00:25:47.588 --> 00:25:49.910
in the Catholic Church you
cannot take it back.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:55.939
That is, how can such--how can
words uttered in these

00:25:55.939 --> 00:25:59.650
circumstances make a marriage?
 

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:04.618
How can freewill be so easily
surrendered?

00:26:04.618 --> 00:26:08.624
The Council of Trent proclaimed
that the church abhorred

00:26:08.624 --> 00:26:12.263
clandestine marriages and
ordered the clergy not to

00:26:12.263 --> 00:26:16.486
celebrate weddings without
published bands and the presence

00:26:16.486 --> 00:26:17.868
of witnesses.
 

00:26:17.868 --> 00:26:22.037
This was incorporated by Philip
the Second into Spanish

00:26:22.037 --> 00:26:26.203
statutory law in 1564 and
remained as the foundation of

00:26:26.203 --> 00:26:30.140
marriage in Spain until the
nineteenth century.

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:35.660
The conflict is dealt with very
subtly in this story.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:39.653
Basilio is proficient in canon
and civil law,

00:26:39.653 --> 00:26:45.099
and he puts it to good use in
his trick to marry Quiteria.

00:26:45.099 --> 00:26:46.818
How does he do that?
 

00:26:46.818 --> 00:26:50.660
Well, he threatens to die
without confession.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.720
I have to underline this
because, even if you are a

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:59.349
Catholic, this is very difficult
to conceive from a modern

00:26:59.349 --> 00:27:00.650
perspective.
 

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:03.269
So, you want to die without
confession?

00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:05.250
So what?
 

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:06.480
Go ahead, be my guest!
 

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:15.221
But, by threatening to do that,
he his accusing them of sending

00:27:15.221 --> 00:27:22.204
him irrevocably to hell,
because suicide is a mortal

00:27:22.204 --> 00:27:29.380
sin, and if he dies without
confession and commits suicide,

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.308
he's going to hell,
no matter what.

00:27:31.308 --> 00:27:34.048
This is how he convinces
everyone;

00:27:34.048 --> 00:27:37.720
he knows canon law and he knows
civil law.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:44.082
So to die without confession if
she will not give in would

00:27:44.082 --> 00:27:47.990
condemn him to eternal
damnation.

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:53.604
Quiteria and the others would
have done more harm to this way

00:27:53.604 --> 00:27:57.914
than murdering him;
murdering him would be nothing

00:27:57.914 --> 00:28:00.338
compared to eternal damnation.
 

00:28:00.338 --> 00:28:05.567
Then he has both Quiteria and
himself utter the words about

00:28:05.567 --> 00:28:10.346
free consent that would
legitimize the marriage before

00:28:10.346 --> 00:28:12.420
church and society.
 

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:16.988
I'm sure you remember the
episode in which he insists,

00:28:16.988 --> 00:28:20.952
and the proper words,
the legal words are used,

00:28:20.952 --> 00:28:22.848
affirming consent.
 

00:28:22.848 --> 00:28:27.252
She confirms later her
determination afterwards to

00:28:27.252 --> 00:28:32.464
dispel any doubt about her
desires and make void any future

00:28:32.464 --> 00:28:37.270
claims to dissolve the marriage;
that is, she confirms it

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:40.936
afterwards, so it wasn't just in
the spare of the moment,

00:28:40.936 --> 00:28:44.078
she confirms that she wants to
marry Basilio.

00:28:44.078 --> 00:28:50.596
All of these are very carefully
constructed episodes to show

00:28:50.596 --> 00:28:53.690
Basilio's lawyerly skills.
 

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:58.628
But, as I am suggesting,
in this story Cervantes probes

00:28:58.628 --> 00:29:03.292
deeper into the issue of
marriage, deeper than legal

00:29:03.292 --> 00:29:04.298
issues.
 

00:29:04.298 --> 00:29:08.929
He goes back to marriage as a
kind of transubstantiation,

00:29:08.929 --> 00:29:13.890
a transcendental metamorphosis
of matter, a transformation of

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:14.798
matter.
 

00:29:14.798 --> 00:29:18.998
The blending of bloods,
literally, that makes the union

00:29:18.998 --> 00:29:21.019
indivisible, presumably.
 

00:29:21.019 --> 00:29:25.186
In looking at the episode with
this background in mind it

00:29:25.186 --> 00:29:29.429
appears that Cervantes is
favoring the clandestine "I

00:29:29.429 --> 00:29:33.150
do" that Quiteria must have
articulated,

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:38.560
while at the same time having
her and Basilio observe the

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.910
rituals prescribed by the
Council of Trent.

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:47.477
It seems to be a middle course:
the sacramental nature of

00:29:47.477 --> 00:29:52.452
marriage lurks in the subtext of
the story through the myth of

00:29:52.452 --> 00:29:54.900
Pyramus and Thisbe.
 

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:59.616
It is a tragic story the myth
of Pyramus and Thisbe in

00:29:59.616 --> 00:30:03.941
which a cruel fate befalls the
young lovers because of a

00:30:03.941 --> 00:30:08.395
misinterpretation,
although it could be read as an

00:30:08.395 --> 00:30:12.578
admonitory tale about the
recklessness of youth.

00:30:12.578 --> 00:30:16.147
The myth goes back to the
conjunction of love and death at

00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:20.278
the moment when love ripens and
is about to become regenerative.

00:30:20.278 --> 00:30:23.794
Driven by desire,
the young lovers are to meet at

00:30:23.794 --> 00:30:26.209
the tomb of Ninus,
where they die,

00:30:26.209 --> 00:30:30.088
not killed by the lioness but
by their own hands.

00:30:30.088 --> 00:30:33.940
The bloody veil can be seen as
an image of the hymen,

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:37.118
rent in the act of love,
a bloody event,

00:30:37.118 --> 00:30:41.284
the renting of the hymen,
that also recalls the onset of

00:30:41.284 --> 00:30:44.413
menstruation;
that is, the beginning of the

00:30:44.413 --> 00:30:48.400
capacity for reproduction but
also the recurrent death of a

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.500
woman's ovum.
 

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:54.336
The red of the tree's fruit is
both a symbol of resurrection

00:30:54.336 --> 00:30:57.778
and of death,
as it recalls menstruation in

00:30:57.778 --> 00:31:00.318
their reoccurring coloring.
 

00:31:00.318 --> 00:31:05.086
The myth reenacts a tragic
human predicament symbolized by

00:31:05.086 --> 00:31:08.348
the spilling of blood at
conception,

00:31:08.348 --> 00:31:12.154
birth and death,
leaving open the possibility

00:31:12.154 --> 00:31:15.643
that the law,
here the parent's disapproval,

00:31:15.643 --> 00:31:19.640
can overcome or forestall the
fatality of the situation.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.077
But the prohibition is also
allied to death because it is

00:31:23.077 --> 00:31:26.210
instrumental in bringing about
the tragic ending.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:31.290
In Ovid, the conflict appears
to resolve itself in beauty,

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:34.589
the gorgeous red fruit of the
tree.

00:31:34.589 --> 00:31:37.338
In Cervantes it goes further.
 

00:31:37.338 --> 00:31:43.950
By way of contrast and
comparison we will later see how

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:49.460
Velázquez deals with
classical myth.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:53.029
In Cervantes the myth of
Pyramus and Thisbe is

00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:55.707
given in chards,
fragments, with a faint

00:31:55.707 --> 00:31:58.108
outline, like a distant memory.
 

00:31:58.108 --> 00:32:01.578
It looks forward towards Joyce,
the Ulysses,

00:32:01.578 --> 00:32:04.847
where these fragments appear,
more than backwards to the

00:32:04.847 --> 00:32:08.176
Middle Ages and the Renaissance
where the myths were more

00:32:08.176 --> 00:32:08.950
coherent.
 

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:12.606
I am inclined to believe,
however, that Cervantes had

00:32:12.606 --> 00:32:16.476
Ovid's text in front of him,
or that he had a prodigious

00:32:16.476 --> 00:32:17.250
memory.
 

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:20.546
For instance,
when Basilio feigns being near

00:32:20.546 --> 00:32:23.460
death, his eyes are part of the
act.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:28.009
If you remember:
'his eyes already turn in his

00:32:28.009 --> 00:32:28.818
head.'
 

00:32:28.818 --> 00:32:32.996
He's playing that he's about to
die so he has his eyes turned

00:32:32.996 --> 00:32:36.332
into his head,
which recalls the moment when

00:32:36.332 --> 00:32:39.450
Thisbe asks Pyramus to answer
whereupon--

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:42.807
I'm not going to read you the
Latin because then I'm going to

00:32:42.807 --> 00:32:45.160
really sound like a priest
saying mass--

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.703
the translation:
"He heard the name of

00:32:48.703 --> 00:32:53.683
Thisbe and he lifted his eyes
with the weight of death heavy

00:32:53.683 --> 00:32:56.788
upon them,
and saw her face and closed his

00:32:56.788 --> 00:32:57.500
eyes."
 

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.373
So the eyes,
the element,

00:32:59.373 --> 00:33:03.900
this is one of the chards that
I say remain of the myth.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:08.130
My argument follows what I
would like to call or what I

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:11.970
like to call an "itinerary
of blood."

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:15.791
From the pregnant calf on the
spit that Sancho sees when they

00:33:15.791 --> 00:33:19.295
arrive at the wedding which
foretells of the sacrificial

00:33:19.295 --> 00:33:23.078
victim,
the groom, which he replaces.

00:33:23.078 --> 00:33:26.773
It also recalls the violence at
weddings, Romeo and Juliet being

00:33:26.773 --> 00:33:29.588
the most famous example in
western literature.

00:33:29.588 --> 00:33:32.622
The violence,
the blood, announce gestation

00:33:32.622 --> 00:33:36.449
and the spilling of more blood
as the new human being,

00:33:36.449 --> 00:33:40.420
the most elemental purpose of
marriage is produced.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:44.491
The consumption of the animals,
the wine and the bread have

00:33:44.491 --> 00:33:46.950
obvious Christian symbolism,
too.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:50.154
To consume and to consummate go
together in a wedding

00:33:50.154 --> 00:33:52.190
celebration, as I said earlier.
 

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:57.239
They consume the world around
them including the earth through

00:33:57.239 --> 00:33:58.150
the wine.
 

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:01.038
It is a form,
again, of transubstantiation.

00:34:01.038 --> 00:34:04.959
Transubstantiation is the word
for the Eucharist,

00:34:04.959 --> 00:34:09.940
when the body of Christ is
transformed into bread and wine.

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:14.893
That is of transforming one
substance into another through

00:34:14.893 --> 00:34:18.980
actions that involve both
pleasure and violence:

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.840
hunting,
butchering, squashing the

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:23.780
grapes and, of course,
sex.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:27.074
Basilio's intervention
postpones the blood Quiteria

00:34:27.074 --> 00:34:31.030
would have shed in Camacho's bed
substituting it for the fake

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:33.139
blood that he has concealed.
 

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:38.677
This blood stains his garment;
the proxy blood suspends the

00:34:38.677 --> 00:34:41.429
real blood that would seal the
marriage.

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:45.360
But I contend that there is
another hidden blood that

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:49.820
forestalls the consummation of
the intended marriage between

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.710
Camacho and Quiteria.
 

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:57.076
And you don't have to follow me
on this or be persuaded if you

00:34:57.076 --> 00:34:58.219
don't want.
 

00:34:58.219 --> 00:35:01.773
To put it bluntly,
I think that Quiteria is

00:35:01.773 --> 00:35:04.650
menstruating on her wedding day.
 

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:08.090
In the Spanish original,
it says: "Venía la

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:11.338
hermosa Quiteria algo
descolorida y debía ser

00:35:11.338 --> 00:35:15.032
de la mala noche que siempre
pasan las novias en componerse

00:35:15.032 --> 00:35:18.409
para el día venidero de
sus bodas."

00:35:18.409 --> 00:35:22.333
Jarvis: "The fair Quiteria
looked a little pale occasioned

00:35:22.333 --> 00:35:25.815
perhaps by want of rest the
preceding night which brides

00:35:25.815 --> 00:35:29.297
always employ in setting
themselves off and dressing for

00:35:29.297 --> 00:35:31.829
their wedding day
following."

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:35.938
"Descolorida"
in the Spanish does not just

00:35:35.938 --> 00:35:37.619
mean pale,
a little pale,

00:35:37.619 --> 00:35:41.726
but to have lost one's color,
because of an illness,

00:35:41.726 --> 00:35:43.159
or a fright.
 

00:35:43.159 --> 00:35:45.904
And "componerse"
means to dress up,

00:35:45.904 --> 00:35:48.960
of course, but also to recover
from an illness.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.929
Why mention that she's pale?
 

00:35:50.929 --> 00:35:53.710
I believe that the suggestion
is that she's menstruating.

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:57.824
Menstruation is fraught with
all kinds of prohibitions and

00:35:57.824 --> 00:36:01.505
lore in all cultures,
in ours going back all the way

00:36:01.505 --> 00:36:03.309
to the Old Testament.
 

00:36:03.309 --> 00:36:05.802
Now, menstruation,
in this case,

00:36:05.802 --> 00:36:10.543
would have been a providential
blood that would have impeded

00:36:10.543 --> 00:36:15.286
the consummation of Camacho's
marriage postponing Quiteria's

00:36:15.286 --> 00:36:19.869
hymeneal blood and preserving it
for Basilio's bed.

00:36:19.869 --> 00:36:24.500
Quiteria's menstruation,
her regla,

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.510
which is another word of saying
menstruation in Spanish,

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:30.099
and it means,
"rule,"

00:36:30.099 --> 00:36:34.070
simply "rule"
would be a superior law

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:39.335
inherent in the blood itself in
determining the outcome of the

00:36:39.335 --> 00:36:40.630
conflict.
 

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:45.510
Marriage is seen as ordained by
God part of a divine plan that

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:49.909
supersedes custom or law and
overrides considerations of

00:36:49.909 --> 00:36:51.989
unequal social status.
 

00:36:51.989 --> 00:36:55.855
The process of marriage is
embedded in bloods itself,

00:36:55.855 --> 00:37:00.166
in the general transformation
of matter according to divine

00:37:00.166 --> 00:37:00.909
grace.
 

00:37:00.909 --> 00:37:04.117
In the Bible,
man and woman would become one

00:37:04.117 --> 00:37:05.400
flesh in marriage.
 

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:10.969
In Ovid's pagan version there
is no salvation possible,

00:37:10.969 --> 00:37:15.449
the lover's fusion is only
achieved as ashes in a funerary

00:37:15.449 --> 00:37:19.460
urn or in the beauty of a
mulberry tree in bloom.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:22.827
In Cervantes,
a form of justice has been

00:37:22.827 --> 00:37:24.887
made,
and that is every reason to

00:37:24.887 --> 00:37:27.418
believe that the commingling of
bloods will lead to

00:37:27.418 --> 00:37:31.059
regeneration,
to the birth of a new human

00:37:31.059 --> 00:37:31.780
being.
 

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:37.099
This is a kind of conclusion
that we did not find in Part I,

00:37:37.099 --> 00:37:41.726
where marriages are yet to
occur, except in the tale about

00:37:41.726 --> 00:37:46.840
foolish curiosity where there is
also a great deal of blood,

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.059
if you remember.
 

00:37:49.059 --> 00:37:52.898
I think that in a deep sense
Cervantes is true to Ovid and to

00:37:52.898 --> 00:37:55.329
the spirit of
Metamorphoses,

00:37:55.329 --> 00:37:57.449
"meta,"
movement

00:37:57.449 --> 00:38:00.829
"morphoses"
the change of form,

00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:07.077
but has given it a Christian
twist and translated it into the

00:38:07.077 --> 00:38:08.119
present.
 

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:12.554
In Cervantes,
the myth is not retold with a

00:38:12.554 --> 00:38:17.518
didactic satirical or even
aesthetic purpose.

00:38:17.518 --> 00:38:20.639
In fact, it is not so much
retold, as recycled.

00:38:20.639 --> 00:38:34.760
It is not an Ovide
Moralisé,

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:40.313
which was--from 1340--was a
book in French by Pierre

00:38:40.313 --> 00:38:44.038
Bersuire,
which influenced many writers,

00:38:44.038 --> 00:38:47.529
including Chaucer,
and into which fifteen books or

00:38:47.529 --> 00:38:50.317
chapters of the
Metamorphoses are turned

00:38:50.317 --> 00:38:53.268
into allegories,
as I mentioned before,

00:38:53.268 --> 00:38:54.690
moral allegories.
 

00:38:54.690 --> 00:39:01.878
Here this is not what Cervantes
does at all either on the level

00:39:01.878 --> 00:39:07.909
of marriage as a social
institution and so forth,

00:39:07.909 --> 00:39:14.175
or that deeper level that I'm
claiming is told in this

00:39:14.175 --> 00:39:21.150
substory or subtext that I
called the itinerary of blood.

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:25.818
Now in this use of myth
Cervantes resembles

00:39:25.818 --> 00:39:27.929
Velázquez.
 

00:39:27.929 --> 00:39:34.000
So let us turn to
Velázquez again,

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:41.409
and now we have to douse the
lights or put the curtains down,

00:39:41.409 --> 00:39:44.949
and Elena is going to be good
enough to be showing us some

00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:48.614
paintings by Velázquez
that I just want to discuss in

00:39:48.614 --> 00:39:49.670
this context.
 

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:55.157
So if you wait a minute for the
theatrical part of the

00:39:55.157 --> 00:40:00.130
presentation today to be
prepared, as it were.

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:05.840
All the way down,
all the way down.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.630
Over there it cannot go all the
way down...

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:09.889
Okay, that's good enough.
 

00:40:09.889 --> 00:40:19.603
And then we turn off the lights
and I have to let my eyes adjust

00:40:19.603 --> 00:40:24.230
so that I can read my notes.
 

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:27.760
Let's go to Los
borrachos.

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.210
Ok.
 

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:32.219
The Spanish philosopher
José Ortega y Gasset,

00:40:32.219 --> 00:40:36.768
whom I have mentioned before,
but I think that I want you to

00:40:36.768 --> 00:40:40.329
remember him as part of--
can you see from this side?

00:40:40.329 --> 00:40:41.269
No.
 

00:40:41.269 --> 00:41:08.059
 
 

00:41:08.059 --> 00:41:11.356
I mentioned him before;
he's the most important Spanish

00:41:11.356 --> 00:41:12.989
philosopher of the twentieth
century,

00:41:12.989 --> 00:41:16.858
known in this country mostly
for his book The Revolution

00:41:16.858 --> 00:41:20.789
of the Masses,
but also--he also should be

00:41:20.789 --> 00:41:24.050
read for many books,
but one is The

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:28.034
Dehumanization of Art,
which is about the avant-garde

00:41:28.034 --> 00:41:28.369
art.
 

00:41:28.369 --> 00:41:31.766
In any case,
the Spanish philosopher Ortega

00:41:31.766 --> 00:41:36.458
y Gasset claimed that what
Velázquez meant by mixing

00:41:36.458 --> 00:41:41.393
classical gods with unsavory or
ordinary characters from every

00:41:41.393 --> 00:41:46.083
day reality is that there are no
gods and no transcendental

00:41:46.083 --> 00:41:49.556
meaning,
if we take the gods to be the

00:41:49.556 --> 00:41:53.605
representation of the higher
sense of things when seen in

00:41:53.605 --> 00:41:55.630
connection to each other.
 

00:41:55.630 --> 00:42:02.219
Velázquez,
he says is, I quote now Ortega:

00:42:02.219 --> 00:42:09.179
"...an atheistic giant,
a colossal impious man.

00:42:09.179 --> 00:42:14.625
With his brush he banishes the
gods as if smacking them with a

00:42:14.625 --> 00:42:19.356
broom [I love this simile
because you can think of the

00:42:19.356 --> 00:42:24.264
brush as a little broom]
in his Bacanal [which is

00:42:24.264 --> 00:42:29.853
this painting,
known in Spanish as Los

00:42:29.853 --> 00:42:34.425
borrachos,
The Drunks]

00:42:34.425 --> 00:42:43.710
there is not only no Baccus but
a rascal impersonating Baccus.

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:46.635
Bacanal has nine
figures, two of which seem to be

00:42:46.635 --> 00:42:49.969
dressed,
rather undressed for a bacanal

00:42:49.969 --> 00:42:53.820
[bacanals are feasts in honor of
Baccus,

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:57.012
the god of wine,
celebrated in the spring and

00:42:57.012 --> 00:42:57.518
fall.
 

00:42:57.518 --> 00:43:02.530
These two guys who are near
naked].

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:07.119
The others are lusty peasants
roughly clothed in contemporary

00:43:07.119 --> 00:43:11.402
dress and with the same sort of
casual not posed air that

00:43:11.402 --> 00:43:15.838
characterized the naturalistic
genre scenes called in Spain

00:43:15.838 --> 00:43:20.121
"bodegones"
[which is simply "still

00:43:20.121 --> 00:43:23.653
lifes" in English,
in Spanish they're called

00:43:23.653 --> 00:43:25.000
"bodegones"].
 

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:34.409
 
 

00:43:34.409 --> 00:43:37.650
This painting sought and
achieved the effect of a

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:39.809
casually chosen slice of life.
 

00:43:39.809 --> 00:43:43.768
But Bacanal is carefully
composed around the light flesh

00:43:43.768 --> 00:43:46.449
of the bogus Baccus at the
center."

00:43:46.449 --> 00:43:52.873
Jonathan Brown says--he's one
of the great experts on

00:43:52.873 --> 00:43:58.342
Velázquez;
he wrote a book with Elliott on

00:43:58.342 --> 00:44:04.467
Spanish architecture,
that attempts to interpret that

00:44:04.467 --> 00:44:08.173
painting,
quote: "as a parody of the

00:44:08.173 --> 00:44:13.110
Olympian gods or as a sermon on
the evils of drink have failed,

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:17.246
and instead Velázquez
intended to represent Baccus as

00:44:17.246 --> 00:44:21.384
a giver of the gift of wine
which freed man temporarily from

00:44:21.384 --> 00:44:24.820
the harsh unforgiving struggle
of daily life.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:28.840
Deprived of the beneficent
liquid, the beggar finds no

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:33.621
respite from the hardships which
in sober moments will be shared

00:44:33.621 --> 00:44:36.050
by all of the company."
 

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:42.409
This marvelous painting hangs
at the Prado Museum,

00:44:42.409 --> 00:44:48.041
and if you remember the words
by Auerbach about the subtle

00:44:48.041 --> 00:44:51.599
plastic nature of Cervantes'
art,

00:44:51.599 --> 00:44:56.840
of his depiction of things and
of sensuous,

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.731
you can see that there is,
besides the connection I'm

00:44:59.731 --> 00:45:04.164
trying to establish here,
a kinship between Cervantes'

00:45:04.164 --> 00:45:07.760
art and that of
Velázquez,

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:11.677
and you can imagine these
characters as appearing in

00:45:11.677 --> 00:45:15.980
episodes of the Quixote,
I'm sure.

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:23.710
Look at the face of stupor on
this drunk, he has sort of a

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:30.356
grin of stupidity and
drunkenness, and the others,

00:45:30.356 --> 00:45:32.119
you know?
 

00:45:32.119 --> 00:45:42.099
The Spinners,
Las hilanderas,

00:45:42.099 --> 00:45:51.840
was painted around 1657,
it is thus a very late work,

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.909
contemporaneous with Las
Meninas,

00:45:54.909 --> 00:45:58.349
and nearly as complex and as
ambitious.

00:45:58.349 --> 00:46:03.414
In it, Velázquez has
combined two subjects,

00:46:03.414 --> 00:46:08.996
one from the classical
mythology and the other from his

00:46:08.996 --> 00:46:10.340
own time.
 

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:14.059
It is a commonplace work scene,
as you can see.

00:46:14.059 --> 00:46:18.128
There are, in fact,
two stories from classical

00:46:18.128 --> 00:46:22.289
mythology combined in the
picture: the fable of

00:46:22.289 --> 00:46:28.440
Arachne and the story of
Jupiter's Rape of Europa.

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.938
In the foreground we have the
activities of tapestry

00:46:31.938 --> 00:46:36.260
manufacturing as was done in the
factories under royal patronage

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:38.554
in Madrid,
and in the alcove,

00:46:38.554 --> 00:46:41.155
in the back,
the classical tale of the

00:46:41.155 --> 00:46:42.420
weaver Arachne.
 

00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:46.972
The scene takes place at
Arachne's shop,

00:46:46.972 --> 00:46:52.695
where, as a great artist,
she's visited by elegant

00:46:52.695 --> 00:46:53.980
ladies.
 

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:58.190
The tapestry hanging on the
back wall of the alcove,

00:46:58.190 --> 00:47:02.485
which is presumably Arachne's
work, is the key to the

00:47:02.485 --> 00:47:05.789
relationship between the two
scenes.

00:47:05.789 --> 00:47:10.331
It is a woven copy of Tizian's
The Rape of

00:47:10.331 --> 00:47:14.429
Europa--Could you give me
that painting?

00:47:14.429 --> 00:47:20.644
This is the actual painting by
Tizian, The Rape of

00:47:20.644 --> 00:47:27.936
Europa which--back to the
Hilanderas--which we find

00:47:27.936 --> 00:47:32.000
in the back, in that tapestry.
 

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.766
The Rape of Europa is
one of the most celebrated of

00:47:36.766 --> 00:47:40.780
Jupiter's erotic adventures with
mortal women;

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:44.469
Arachne has challenged Minerva,
patroness of weavers and

00:47:44.469 --> 00:47:47.219
goddess of wisdom to a weaving
contest.

00:47:47.219 --> 00:47:50.784
It was called a draw,
but because Arachne's tapestry

00:47:50.784 --> 00:47:53.789
was judged to be the equal of
Minerva's,

00:47:53.789 --> 00:47:56.297
and further,
because it depicted such a

00:47:56.297 --> 00:48:00.686
scandalous act by her father,
the goddess punished Arachne by

00:48:00.686 --> 00:48:02.670
turning her into a spider.
 

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:08.018
The story is also drawn from
Ovid's Metamorphoses,

00:48:08.018 --> 00:48:09.070
book six.
 

00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:14.570
This is the reason Minerva is
shown gesturing angrily.

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:20.898
Jonathan Brown,
again, believes that by,

00:48:20.898 --> 00:48:23.876
quote:
"by inserting a quotation

00:48:23.876 --> 00:48:26.297
from this famous work,
The Rape of

00:48:26.297 --> 00:48:29.693
Europa into the composition
Velázquez implies his

00:48:29.693 --> 00:48:33.030
believe in the nobility and
transcendental value of the art

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:34.010
of painting.
 

00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:37.610
In The Spinners,
Velázquez seeks to

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:42.260
reconcile the artificial world
of myth with a palpable world of

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:46.309
visual reality without
sacrificing the decorum required

00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:50.059
by the one and the
verisimilitude by the other [the

00:48:50.059 --> 00:48:54.710
decorum by the classical myth
and the verisimilitude,

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:57.010
the realism by the other].
 

00:48:57.010 --> 00:49:00.753
The contrast [he goes on]
between the foreground where

00:49:00.753 --> 00:49:05.204
sturdy women toil at burdensome
tasks and the refined atmosphere

00:49:05.204 --> 00:49:08.454
of the artist's atelier [the
scene in the back]

00:49:08.454 --> 00:49:12.621
is perhaps Velázquez's
way of implying his conviction

00:49:12.621 --> 00:49:16.719
about the distinction between
craft and art."

00:49:16.719 --> 00:49:20.744
While this is fine--that's the
end of the quote by Jonathan

00:49:20.744 --> 00:49:23.577
Brown--
and at the time there was a

00:49:23.577 --> 00:49:28.237
raging dispute as to whether
painters were artists or mere

00:49:28.237 --> 00:49:32.969
artisans;
this may seem strange to us but

00:49:32.969 --> 00:49:34.300
there was.
 

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:36.507
And, of course,
Tizian had been a favorite

00:49:36.507 --> 00:49:39.284
painter of Charles the Fiftg,
the previous century,

00:49:39.284 --> 00:49:43.052
and Philip the Second,
so the painting is in homage to

00:49:43.052 --> 00:49:45.231
him,
and there is no doubt that by

00:49:45.231 --> 00:49:48.887
inserting Tizian's painting into
his Velázquez is putting

00:49:48.887 --> 00:49:50.570
himself at the same level.
 

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:54.610
But there is a lot more to it,
it seems to me,

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:58.385
as in Las Meninas there
seems to be a revelation of the

00:49:58.385 --> 00:50:02.844
act of artistic creation,
which in the painting has to do

00:50:02.844 --> 00:50:07.375
with Minerva and Arachne,
but that taking the whole work

00:50:07.375 --> 00:50:11.327
into consideration has to do
with Velázquez's own

00:50:11.327 --> 00:50:12.190
creation.
 

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:17.130
Creation appears as a layered
process that involves the real--

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:21.655
this is the real--either
because art is a reflection of

00:50:21.655 --> 00:50:25.510
reality or because art
illuminates reality,

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:31.041
but also because reality
unveils the artificiality of

00:50:31.041 --> 00:50:31.679
art.
 

00:50:31.679 --> 00:50:35.719
In The Spinners we have
paintings within paintings,

00:50:35.719 --> 00:50:38.050
and the presence in the
foreground--

00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:41.041
and the present,
this is the present in the

00:50:41.041 --> 00:50:45.469
foreground--
appears as a repetition of the

00:50:45.469 --> 00:50:47.300
classical past.
 

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:51.572
But it is a repetition that is
also a comedown:

00:50:51.572 --> 00:50:56.960
can the present day spinners
recall the myth of Arachne?

00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:00.579
It seems to me that what
Velázquez is doing,

00:51:00.579 --> 00:51:04.949
as Ortega y Gasset suggested
about the Bacanal this

00:51:04.949 --> 00:51:09.632
diminishing the gods,
and also by showing Minerva's

00:51:09.632 --> 00:51:15.396
studio within the weaving shop,
he's showing the inner recesses

00:51:15.396 --> 00:51:18.900
of representation:
it's backstage tricks,

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:24.210
as it were, and as he showed in
Las Meninas.

00:51:24.210 --> 00:51:27.407
The whole painting is a
desengaño, is in

00:51:27.407 --> 00:51:29.820
other words is what I'm trying
to say.

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:33.768
What we take to be gods are
like today's spinners.

00:51:33.768 --> 00:51:38.061
The weaver's shop is no
different from Minerva's studio

00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:42.670
in both the deception of art are
created to deceive man.

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:46.130
We see the contemporary weavers
in relation to the classical

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:48.134
fable,
and we see at the center of

00:51:48.134 --> 00:51:51.409
Velázquez's painting a
quotation from a masterpiece.

00:51:51.409 --> 00:51:53.949
It is, again,
an infinitely receding

00:51:53.949 --> 00:51:56.643
sequence,
a play of mirrors within this

00:51:56.643 --> 00:52:00.289
workshop of representation that
we are being given here,

00:52:00.289 --> 00:52:02.623
which is like giving us a
workshop of

00:52:02.623 --> 00:52:05.905
engaño,
therefore by giving us that

00:52:05.905 --> 00:52:10.929
workshop,
it is a desengaño.

00:52:10.929 --> 00:52:18.369
Now, the process is similar to
what Cervantes does in Camacho's

00:52:18.369 --> 00:52:23.409
wedding episode,
and of the whole of the

00:52:23.409 --> 00:52:27.489
Quixote dealing with myth.
 

00:52:27.489 --> 00:52:30.771
The fable of Pyramus and
Thisbe takes place in

00:52:30.771 --> 00:52:33.804
fabulous Babylon;
Camacho's wedding takes place

00:52:33.804 --> 00:52:36.210
in an insignificant village in
Spain.

00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:40.751
What Basilio does is to use the
artistry of the fable to deceive

00:52:40.751 --> 00:52:44.059
those in attendance,
particularly Camacho and his

00:52:44.059 --> 00:52:46.094
friends,
but also Don Quixote,

00:52:46.094 --> 00:52:49.565
Sancho and even the reader,
who does not know what is

00:52:49.565 --> 00:52:53.166
happening until the moment that
the trick is revealed to bring

00:52:53.166 --> 00:52:56.059
the story to a climax and
eventual resolution.

00:52:56.059 --> 00:52:59.268
There is a mirroring of myth
and present reality,

00:52:59.268 --> 00:53:01.829
and the elaboration of a deceit
through artistry,

00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:08.500
acting, playing the role of the
mythological Pyramus--

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:12.039
Basilio playing that role,
acting it out.

00:53:12.039 --> 00:53:13.777
It is both an
engaño and a

00:53:13.777 --> 00:53:16.139
desengaño,
making up the whole story.

00:53:16.139 --> 00:53:19.893
The backstage of representation
is displayed as in Las

00:53:19.893 --> 00:53:23.099
Meninas,
and as we shall soon see in the

00:53:23.099 --> 00:53:27.268
episode involving Maese Pedro,
Ginés de Pasamonte as

00:53:27.268 --> 00:53:31.268
puppeteer and most revealingly
in the culminating episode in

00:53:31.268 --> 00:53:36.423
the whole of the Quixote,
the one about Montesinos cave,

00:53:36.423 --> 00:53:41.853
in which we are given the whole
underpinning of Don Quixote's

00:53:41.853 --> 00:53:45.210
madness,
his actual subconscious.

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:49.340
Now, whereas in Part I
Cervantes seems to be addressing

00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:53.625
the romances of chivalry and the
picaresque as models and

00:53:53.625 --> 00:53:55.909
sources,
in Part II he takes up the

00:53:55.909 --> 00:53:58.739
grand tradition of Homer,
Ovid, Virgil and Dante,

00:53:58.739 --> 00:54:02.496
particularly in episodes such
as the cave of Montesinos and

00:54:02.496 --> 00:54:06.190
the pageant in the forest that
we will be seeing soon.

00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:08.630
This is very significant.
 

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:13.539
It seems to me that he now
knows that he is in their league

00:54:13.539 --> 00:54:18.025
and that he has created a
literary character that will

00:54:18.025 --> 00:54:22.594
endure like theirs and like the
characters in classical

00:54:22.594 --> 00:54:23.949
mythology.
 

00:54:23.949 --> 00:54:30.000

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.094
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Okay,

00:00:02.094 --> 00:00:03.560
welcome back for more
cosmology.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.043
What I want to do today is
quickly review what we were

00:00:08.043 --> 00:00:12.866
doing about magnitudes and make
a comment or two about the

00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:16.162
problem set,
and then, go back and talk

00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:20.198
about the implications of the
Hubble Law and the Hubble

00:00:20.198 --> 00:00:24.067
Diagram,
which are formidable,

00:00:24.067 --> 00:00:28.340
to put it mildly.
Okay, magnitudes.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.030
There's a couple of these
magnitude equations.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.619
I'm just going to write them
down.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.280
The first of them looks like
this.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:52.453
And this equation is used--okay.
So, this equation is used to

00:00:52.453 --> 00:00:56.520
relate magnitudes of two
different objects to each other.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.710
So, we've got two different
objects.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.092
And it can be used for either
kind of magnitude--either

00:01:04.092 --> 00:01:10.072
absolute or apparent magnitude,
just so long as you don't mix

00:01:10.072 --> 00:01:13.302
them.
So, it's two different objects,

00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:22.420
but only one of the magnitudes.
One kind of magnitude.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.417
And depending on which kind of
magnitude you use,

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:28.977
this brightness ratio--it's
either the ratio of how bright

00:01:28.977 --> 00:01:32.225
it looks or the ratio of how
bright it is--whatever's

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:35.213
appropriate.
Now, on the help sheet on the

00:01:35.213 --> 00:01:38.684
web, I have this equation in a
somewhat different form,

00:01:38.684 --> 00:01:42.090
and it's important to realize
that it's the exact same

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.980
equation.
Watch this.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.260
Let's see.
Let's multiply both halves by -

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.358
2/5 which is - 0.4.
So, this is -0.4

00:01:51.358 --> 00:01:55.447
(M_1 –
M_2) = log

00:01:55.447 --> 00:01:59.300
(b_1 /
b_2).

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.720
And then, let's take 10 to the
power of that.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.682
That gets rid of the log.
And this is now the form that

00:02:06.682 --> 00:02:09.689
it is on the help sheet on the
web.

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:12.318
So, it's exactly the same
equation, just expressed

00:02:12.318 --> 00:02:15.841
differently.
And you can use either form,

00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:19.599
whichever is more convenient.
Okay.

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.710
The other equation looks like
this.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:32.014
5 log (D/10 parsecs).
And this relates one object,

00:02:32.014 --> 00:02:37.750
but it relates both kinds of
magnitude to each other.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.425
So, the first one is two
different objects,

00:02:43.425 --> 00:02:46.693
but only one of the magnitudes.
The other is one object and it

00:02:46.693 --> 00:02:50.003
relates the two different kinds
of magnitudes to each other,

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.080
and to the distance to the
object.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.298
And as you can see,
this--both of these equations,

00:02:55.298 --> 00:02:58.740
actually, have three unknowns.
One, two, three.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.323
That means you've got to know
two things in order to find out

00:03:02.323 --> 00:03:05.324
the third.
And that brings me to the

00:03:05.324 --> 00:03:10.808
comment I want to make about
problem 2a on the current

00:03:10.808 --> 00:03:14.260
problem set.
You are asked in this problem

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.349
to determine the difference
between the absolute magnitude

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.558
of one kind of star,
called Type 1 Cepheid,

00:03:21.558 --> 00:03:25.774
so I label it C1.
And another kind of star,

00:03:25.774 --> 00:03:29.879
Type 2 Cepheids,
which I label C2.

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.590
And if you're asked to--and
this difference is called,

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.530
I don't know,
delta M_C or

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.778
something like that.
And having been asked to do

00:03:39.778 --> 00:03:43.090
this, the logical thing that you
might try to do is say,

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.116
all right, I'm going to use one
or the other of these

00:03:45.116 --> 00:03:47.399
equations--I'm not sure,
in advance, which,

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:50.491
to compute this one.
Then I'm going to compute this

00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:51.939
one.
And I'm going to subtract the

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:53.770
two, and that's going to give me
the answer.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.139
That approach will fail.
Okay?

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.304
That doesn't work in this
particular case,

00:03:59.304 --> 00:04:02.473
because you don't actually have
enough information to compute

00:04:02.473 --> 00:04:06.409
either one of these things.
You do have enough information

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:11.165
to compute the difference.
And let me just give you a very

00:04:11.165 --> 00:04:15.410
brief hint on how you might go
about doing that.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.694
Let's see.
Let me take a new piece of

00:04:18.694 --> 00:04:20.434
paper here.
Write down

00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:26.854
m_C1 -
M_C1 = 5 log

00:04:26.854 --> 00:04:31.670
(D_C1 /
10parsecs).

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.444
And now write the exact same
equation down for C2,

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:43.013
where the two different
distances are the distances you

00:04:43.013 --> 00:04:49.510
get by assuming one or the other
kinds of these magnitudes.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.550
This is equation one.
This is equation two.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.240
Now, let's subtract.
1 – 2.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.780
So, then, you get
m_C1 -

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:06.290
m_C2 -
[M_C1 -

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:13.492
M_C2]
= 5 (log D_C1

00:05:13.492 --> 00:05:19.600
- log D_C2).
Okay, now.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.600
Here's the trick.
Turns out for reasons that you

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.290
had better tell me--and TFs
[teaching fellows],

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.138
take note that we really want
them to say why this is true,

00:05:31.138 --> 00:05:34.170
now that I've told them it is.
This is zero.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.899
The two apparent magnitudes are
the same.

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:41.679
And so, that means that this
side of the equation is what you

00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:44.169
want.
It's the difference between

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.519
these two magnitudes.
And then, over here,

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:52.474
you have to use one of these
log rules: log (x) - log

00:05:52.474 --> 00:05:55.896
(y),
if you remember back to

00:05:55.896 --> 00:06:00.389
eleventh grade,
is log (x / y).

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:03.554
And if you use that,
it turns out that you have

00:06:03.554 --> 00:06:07.405
information elsewhere in the
problem, which will tell you

00:06:07.405 --> 00:06:10.570
what you need to know about the
distances.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.376
And so, in this way,
you can solve for the

00:06:20.376 --> 00:06:23.430
difference without actually
being able to determine either

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.152
one of these two things.
So, we'll just leave it at that

00:06:27.152 --> 00:06:30.507
for the moment.
If you have problems there's

00:06:30.507 --> 00:06:34.212
the usual forum,
there's the usual office hours,

00:06:34.212 --> 00:06:38.958
but ponder this.
That's basically how the

00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:46.150
problem has to go.
Okay?

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.350
Problems with magnitudes?

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.872
Okay.
If you do have some,

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:57.486
let us know,
because this is going to be

00:06:57.486 --> 00:07:01.933
critical for solving,
basically, problems for the

00:07:01.933 --> 00:07:05.610
whole rest of the class.
All right.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.685
Yes go ahead.
Student: What is the

00:07:07.685 --> 00:07:10.101
location--the last thing in
green-- Professor Charles

00:07:10.101 --> 00:07:12.884
Bailyn: This?
Student: --5 log--is it

00:07:12.884 --> 00:07:15.247
over log?
Professor Charles

00:07:15.247 --> 00:07:19.567
Bailyn: This is log
(D_C1 / 10

00:07:19.567 --> 00:07:23.110
parsecs) - log
(D_C2 / 10

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.832
parsecs).
That's just subtracting the two

00:07:25.832 --> 00:07:27.540
right-hand sides of this
equation.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:33.444
But then, you get to do the log
thing and divide them instead,

00:07:33.444 --> 00:07:38.090
which is this to this on this
log subtraction.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.546
Okay.
Let me remind you why we're

00:07:40.546 --> 00:07:42.790
putting ourselves through this
pain.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.105
Okay?
Recall why we started doing

00:07:46.105 --> 00:07:51.056
this in the first place.
The goal was to figure out how

00:07:51.056 --> 00:07:55.766
to measure the Hubble Diagram.
The Hubble Diagram is this

00:07:55.766 --> 00:07:58.604
diagram of velocity,
which you can measure by

00:07:58.604 --> 00:08:01.980
redshift versus distance.
And the whole reason we

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.076
embarked on this adventure in
magnitudes was because that's a

00:08:06.076 --> 00:08:09.899
critical component in how you
determine the distance.

00:08:09.899 --> 00:08:13.899
But if you've got a bunch of
galaxies and you measure these

00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:16.519
two quantities for each one of
them,

00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:19.897
what you discover--what Hubble
discovered--what Edwin Hubble

00:08:19.897 --> 00:08:23.660
discovered many years ago,
is that they line up.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.098
You get this perfect;
well, not quite perfect,

00:08:27.098 --> 00:08:30.900
but close to it--this beautiful
straight line,

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.450
if you measure a bunch of these
things.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:41.848
And the way you represent that
straight line is with this

00:08:41.848 --> 00:08:48.190
equation, where H is
Hubble's Constant.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.695
And so, that's the purpose of
all this magnitude stuff,

00:08:50.695 --> 00:08:53.480
is to be able to determine the
y-axis of this plot.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:58.035
What I now want to do is talk
about the implications of this

00:08:58.035 --> 00:09:02.360
observational fact that galaxies
line up on this line.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.643
It turns out,
this is one of the most

00:09:04.643 --> 00:09:06.990
profound plots in all of
astrophysics,

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:12.145
and possibly all of science.
Because what this implies is,

00:09:12.145 --> 00:09:16.888
first of all,
that the Universe is expanding,

00:09:16.888 --> 00:09:23.033
and hence, it's the basis for
the whole Big Bang Theory of

00:09:23.033 --> 00:09:26.843
cosmology.
And by performing relatively

00:09:26.843 --> 00:09:30.759
simple calculations using this
quantity H,

00:09:30.759 --> 00:09:35.128
you can determine the age of
the Universe,

00:09:35.128 --> 00:09:39.390
and the ultimate fate of the
Universe.

00:09:43.929 --> 00:09:48.150
Not bad for a relatively simple
algebraic equation.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.872
Yes?
Student: [Inaudible]

00:09:49.872 --> 00:09:51.100
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Huh?

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:51.858
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:09:51.858 --> 00:09:52.230
Bailyn: Oh,
fate.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.732
I'll get back to that.
The big question in cosmology

00:09:55.732 --> 00:09:58.700
is, you know--the Universe is
now expanding.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.229
The question is,
will it continue to expand,

00:10:01.229 --> 00:10:03.758
in which case,
the Universe just gets sparse

00:10:03.758 --> 00:10:06.785
and cold and boring,
and expands forever until

00:10:06.785 --> 00:10:09.628
there's, you know,
one pathetic hydrogen atom

00:10:09.628 --> 00:10:13.506
every cubic megaparsec of space.
Or, alternatively,

00:10:13.506 --> 00:10:17.456
it could stop,
slow down, and recollapse into

00:10:17.456 --> 00:10:21.964
something called a Big Crunch,
which is sort of the Big Bang

00:10:21.964 --> 00:10:24.255
run backwards,
and basically the whole thing

00:10:24.255 --> 00:10:27.977
turns into a massive black hole.
These are--you know,

00:10:27.977 --> 00:10:31.970
this is ending in fire or in
ice, I guess.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:38.110
And it can be computed in ways
we'll describe later.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.769
Okay, so, here's what I want to
do.

00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:45.256
I want to start understanding
how this plot and this little

00:10:45.256 --> 00:10:48.970
equation gives you all these
wonderful things.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.909
I'm going to go on for a little
while, then we'll pause,

00:10:51.909 --> 00:10:54.260
and we'll do one of these Q
&amp; A sessions,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.519
because this is sort of the
heart of the Big Bang Theory.

00:10:57.519 --> 00:11:00.240
And so, we'll do one of these
things that we did when we were

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.644
talking about relativity,
where you talk to each other

00:11:02.644 --> 00:11:05.766
and come up with questions.
So, if you've got questions

00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:07.482
along the way,
by all means,

00:11:07.482 --> 00:11:11.105
ask them, but we will have a
specific moment a little ways

00:11:11.105 --> 00:11:15.299
down the line where we actually
pause and do this on purpose.

00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:17.580
So, everybody,
keep thinking as we go along,

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.587
what are your questions?
What don't you understand or

00:11:20.587 --> 00:11:24.132
what questions could you ask to
understand more than what I've

00:11:24.132 --> 00:11:26.860
just told you?
Okay.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:33.503
Here we go.
Imagine a one-dimensional

00:11:33.503 --> 00:11:39.340
Universe, just because it's easy
for me to write down.

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.400
And here's our one-dimensional
Universe.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.490
It's all strung out on a line.
Here's the line.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.580
And it's got a bunch of
galaxies on it.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.623
Let's label these galaxies,
A, B,

00:11:50.623 --> 00:11:53.600
C, D,
E, and F.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.830
And these galaxies are spaced
evenly, let us imagine.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:02.056
And we'll give them coordinates.
So this is at 0,1,

00:12:02.056 --> 00:12:05.879
2, and so forth.
Okay?

00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:10.674
Now, next thing we're going to
do: the Universe is going to

00:12:10.674 --> 00:12:13.578
double in size.
So, we're just going to stretch

00:12:13.578 --> 00:12:15.187
the thing.
The whole thing is going to get

00:12:15.187 --> 00:12:17.120
stretched.
So, here's our Universe.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.117
And now A,
B, C,

00:12:20.117 --> 00:12:25.363
D, E and F
are further apart by a factor of

00:12:25.363 --> 00:12:26.987
two.
A, B,

00:12:26.987 --> 00:12:29.413
C, D, E,
F. And if A,

00:12:29.413 --> 00:12:33.053
we imagine stays at the same
coordinate--if our coordinate

00:12:33.053 --> 00:12:37.060
system starts with A,
this means B is now at 2.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.379
C is 4--6,8 and 10.
Okay.

00:12:41.379 --> 00:12:45.275
And let us imagine that it
takes one time unit--one year or

00:12:45.275 --> 00:12:48.298
something like that,
for this doubling to take

00:12:48.298 --> 00:12:50.479
place.
Now, we're going to ask,

00:12:50.479 --> 00:12:53.121
if you sit--if you live in
galaxy A,

00:12:53.121 --> 00:12:57.026
if you live on planet A,
and you observe the distance

00:12:57.026 --> 00:13:00.749
and velocity of all these other
galaxies, what's it going to

00:13:00.749 --> 00:13:06.690
look like?
So, observer on A.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:11.000
And so, we're going to observe
a particular galaxy--one of

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.260
these other galaxies.
We're going to write down the

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.992
distance.
We'll choose the distance at

00:13:17.992 --> 00:13:20.720
the start, because it's going to
change.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:28.644
Then we're going to evaluate
how that galaxy has moved,

00:13:28.644 --> 00:13:34.245
and then the distance changed.
And then, over here,

00:13:34.245 --> 00:13:35.740
we're going to get the
velocity.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:41.676
The velocity is going to be the
change in distance divided by

00:13:41.676 --> 00:13:46.424
the change in time,
which we've defined to be one

00:13:46.424 --> 00:13:51.780
time unit.
Okay?

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:55.200
So, galaxy B.
Galaxy B starts at a

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.340
distance of 1 away from us,
because it starts 1.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:02.222
A starts at 0.
It moved from 1 to 2,

00:14:02.222 --> 00:14:07.972
and that gives it a change in
distance of 1 and therefore its

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:12.765
velocity over this time,
it's changed in distance by 1,

00:14:12.765 --> 00:14:17.652
it's taken 1 time unit.
The velocity is 1 divided by 1,

00:14:17.652 --> 00:14:20.470
equals 1.
Okay?

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:25.790
The algebra is easy.
Okay, so, how about C?

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:30.790
C starts 2 away.
Its motion--it goes from 2 away

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.414
to 4 away, and so,
the change in its distance is

00:14:34.414 --> 00:14:37.689
2.
And since it takes 1 time unit

00:14:37.689 --> 00:14:42.409
to do, its velocity is 2/1,
which is equal to 2.

00:14:42.409 --> 00:14:45.440
See, the algebra is simple,
but I screw it up.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:51.333
Bethany is laughing at me and
well she might,

00:14:51.333 --> 00:14:55.220
but I caught myself.
All right.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.188
And so on down the line.
I could repeat this simple

00:14:58.188 --> 00:15:00.358
exercise.
D, E,

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:02.820
F start at 3,4,
and 5.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:06.009
Goes from 3 to 6,
from 4 to 8,

00:15:06.009 --> 00:15:10.629
from 5 to 10,
and their velocities are 3,4,

00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:15.467
and 5, respectively.
And so, if I plot distance

00:15:15.467 --> 00:15:19.271
versus velocity,
I'll get points lined up just

00:15:19.271 --> 00:15:21.229
like this.
And so, basically,

00:15:21.229 --> 00:15:24.336
what happens is this.
If you take a set of points on

00:15:24.336 --> 00:15:28.174
a coordinate system and you
simply stretch the coordinate

00:15:28.174 --> 00:15:30.701
system,
what happens is that the

00:15:30.701 --> 00:15:34.690
further away you start,
the greater the stretch is.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:39.948
And so, there is a correlation
between how far away you start

00:15:39.948 --> 00:15:43.629
and how fast the thing recedes
from you.

00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:51.289
Now, this is true regardless of
which point you sit on.

00:15:51.289 --> 00:15:58.953
Let's imagine that we sit on
point--that the observer is on

00:15:58.953 --> 00:16:04.897
point E.
So, on point E, we're

00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:10.708
now going to--which galaxy,
initial distance,

00:16:10.708 --> 00:16:14.847
motion, velocity.
So, this is the same

00:16:14.847 --> 00:16:17.995
plot--chart as before.
E--let's look at

00:16:17.995 --> 00:16:21.840
F, starts at a distance
of 1 because it's 1 unit away.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:26.814
The motion--okay,
at the start it's--let's take a

00:16:26.814 --> 00:16:30.960
quick look at how this is set up
here.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.921
Yes, E is at 4.
So, at the start,

00:16:33.921 --> 00:16:37.179
the distance is between 4 and
5, which is 1.

00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:41.725
And it goes to a distance of 8,
which is where E ends

00:16:41.725 --> 00:16:45.270
up, and 10, which is where
F ends up.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:52.590
So that is a change of 2.
No a change of 1, right?

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:56.738
Because it's gone from 1 away
to 2 away, and the velocity is

00:16:56.738 --> 00:16:59.149
1.
If we look at D,

00:16:59.149 --> 00:17:03.965
it starts at a distance of 1,
goes--starts at 4 to 3,

00:17:03.965 --> 00:17:07.560
that's one separation.
Goes to 8 to 6,

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.660
that's a separation of 2.
Delta D is again equal

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.869
to 1.
Velocity is equal to 1.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:17.040
Let's look, for example,
at B.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:24.275
That starts 3 away.
And it starts from 4--B,

00:17:24.275 --> 00:17:32.200
C, yeah--from 4 to 1.
And it goes from 8 to 2.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:36.160
So, that's a difference of 6
here, a difference 3 there.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.059
And so delta D is equal
to 3.

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:41.349
And so, the velocity is once
again 3.

00:17:41.349 --> 00:17:44.283
And so, you get the exact same
plot with different galaxies,

00:17:44.283 --> 00:17:46.569
because you're sitting in a
different place.

00:17:46.569 --> 00:17:50.940
So, it doesn't matter which
galaxy you're sitting on.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:55.566
You see the exact same ratio of
distance to velocity and you

00:17:55.566 --> 00:18:00.192
create the exact same Hubble
flow no matter which galaxy you

00:18:00.192 --> 00:18:03.250
sit on in this little toy
Universe.

00:18:06.779 --> 00:18:11.157
So, that's the key point--that
if you take a coordinate system

00:18:11.157 --> 00:18:14.027
and you expand it,
you naturally get this

00:18:14.027 --> 00:18:17.400
relationship between distance
and velocity.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.696
Or to turn it around,
if you observe this

00:18:19.696 --> 00:18:22.279
relationship between distance
and velocity,

00:18:22.279 --> 00:18:25.955
then what you're looking at is
a system in which all the

00:18:25.955 --> 00:18:30.164
coordinates are--in which you've
simply stretched the coordinate

00:18:30.164 --> 00:18:32.240
system.
Okay.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:38.696
Now, this gives rise to--this
analogy, with these stretching

00:18:38.696 --> 00:18:45.700
one-dimensional lines gives rise
to two questions people have,

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.806
which I like to call
un-questions,

00:18:47.806 --> 00:18:51.318
because they're actually
questions that arise because of

00:18:51.318 --> 00:18:53.751
the analogy,
not because of the way the

00:18:53.751 --> 00:18:57.615
Universe works.
One question is,

00:18:57.615 --> 00:19:05.490
Q1: "Where is the center?"
You know, here's your line.

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:10.170
It's expanding.
But somewhere in the middle

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.300
here, around C or
D in our thing,

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.940
is the center away from which
everything is expanding.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:19.300
So that's one question.
And the second question is,

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.470
"What is it expanding into?"

00:19:27.619 --> 00:19:31.172
You know, here you have a
little Universe and it's moving

00:19:31.172 --> 00:19:33.220
outwards.
And so, what's going on over

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.969
here?
What was there before the

00:19:34.969 --> 00:19:38.950
Universe moved into it?
These kinds of questions.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:45.035
And those kinds of questions
come about because this is

00:19:45.035 --> 00:19:51.119
actually a bad analogy--this
straight line Universe.

00:19:51.119 --> 00:19:53.769
So, let me give you a slightly
better one.

00:19:53.769 --> 00:19:57.423
We'll stick with the
one-dimensional Universe,

00:19:57.423 --> 00:20:00.843
but now we'll do it this way.
Here's a one-dimensional

00:20:00.843 --> 00:20:02.980
Universe.
You have to stay on the line.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:08.769
So here's A,
B, C, D, E, F,

00:20:08.769 --> 00:20:12.670
whatever.
And it's going to expand.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:17.912
And it's going to expand into
something that looks like this:

00:20:17.912 --> 00:20:22.295
A, B, C, D,
E, F. And all of what we

00:20:22.295 --> 00:20:26.667
just did about the velocity,
and so forth,

00:20:26.667 --> 00:20:32.859
remains the same.
But, notice that this system is

00:20:32.859 --> 00:20:38.400
unbounded.
There's no edge.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.941
There's no edge.
There's no place where you can

00:20:40.941 --> 00:20:43.477
say, this is the end of the
Universe, because if you

00:20:43.477 --> 00:20:46.509
traveled around it you'd just
come back to where you were,

00:20:46.509 --> 00:20:48.460
and therefore,
there's also no center.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.799
And where does it expand into?
It expands into a dimension

00:20:55.799 --> 00:20:57.960
that, if you're a
one-dimensional creature,

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.996
you can't experience because
the whole thing is being pushed

00:21:00.996 --> 00:21:03.286
out.
But if you're forced to live on

00:21:03.286 --> 00:21:06.997
this circle you can't even--you
have no comprehension of what it

00:21:06.997 --> 00:21:09.208
expands into.
It expands into a higher

00:21:09.208 --> 00:21:09.790
dimension.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:25.352
But all of this stuff about,
you know, velocity and

00:21:25.352 --> 00:21:28.599
distance, remains basically the
same.

00:21:28.599 --> 00:21:32.769
Here's a two-dimensional
analogy.

00:21:32.769 --> 00:21:36.491
Let's see, this is--so,
I made a little diagram of the

00:21:36.491 --> 00:21:39.440
Old Campus [an area of the Yale
campus].

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.183
Here's Linsley–Chittenden [a
classroom building]

00:21:41.183 --> 00:21:42.500
where we're sitting right now,
yes?

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.589
Here's the statue of Abraham
Pierson.

00:21:45.589 --> 00:21:48.543
This is the gate between Durfee
and Wright [two undergraduate

00:21:48.543 --> 00:21:49.892
dorm buildings].
Here's Phelps Gate [a classroom

00:21:49.892 --> 00:21:50.519
building and the entrance to Old
Campus].

00:21:50.519 --> 00:21:51.859
Here's Vanderbilt [a dorm
building].

00:21:51.859 --> 00:21:54.029
This is Harkness Tower and
here's Starbucks.

00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:57.240
Okay, that's all that's
important, right?

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.959
So, you following me with that?
And what I did was,

00:22:00.959 --> 00:22:04.463
I took this little picture and
I took it to the Xerox machine

00:22:04.463 --> 00:22:08.704
and I blew it up by 20%.
So, here's the exact same

00:22:08.704 --> 00:22:12.781
diagram blown up by 20%.
So, now, supposing we're

00:22:12.781 --> 00:22:16.309
sitting in Linsley-Chittenden,
which we happen to be doing,

00:22:16.309 --> 00:22:20.947
and the Universe expanded by
20%--or, our little corner of

00:22:20.947 --> 00:22:24.740
the Universe expanded by 20%,
here's what would happen.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:28.151
Now, notice what's happening.
Every object in the Universe is

00:22:28.151 --> 00:22:31.710
moving away from us.
See?

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.503
Here's where Harkness was,
and now it's moved a little

00:22:34.503 --> 00:22:36.769
further, in a straight line away
from us.

00:22:36.769 --> 00:22:39.808
Here is Pierson,
and he's moved a little

00:22:39.808 --> 00:22:43.727
further, straight away from us.
And here's Phelps,

00:22:43.727 --> 00:22:47.920
and it's moved a little
further, straight away from us.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.468
And let me erase those lines,
because what I want to

00:22:51.468 --> 00:22:55.643
demonstrate is that if you're
anywhere else in this Universe,

00:22:55.643 --> 00:23:00.276
the exact same thing happens.
Here we're now sitting on that

00:23:00.276 --> 00:23:04.560
statue, and Linsley-Chittenden
is moving away from us.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.150
Harkness is moving away from us.
Phelps is moving away from.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:11.089
Starbucks is moving away from
us, and so forth.

00:23:11.089 --> 00:23:15.477
Similarly, if you're sitting in
Starbucks, waiting for students

00:23:15.477 --> 00:23:19.440
to come by or something,
the exact same thing happens.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.880
And now, because the distances
are greater, you can see the

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.380
effect that the velocity is
greater at greater distances.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.485
If I'm looking down at
Vanderbilt, it moves straight

00:23:29.485 --> 00:23:31.799
away from me,
but only a little bit.

00:23:31.799 --> 00:23:34.445
If I'm looking all the way
across Old Campus,

00:23:34.445 --> 00:23:36.670
this gate moves a lot away from
me.

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:40.592
And so, once again,
you have a situation in which

00:23:40.592 --> 00:23:44.023
the further away
some--everything is moving

00:23:44.023 --> 00:23:49.444
straight away from you,
but the further away it is,

00:23:49.444 --> 00:23:53.730
the faster it's moving away,
right?

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:59.540
And that's just a consequence
of the fact that you have taken

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:05.187
this geometry and expanded it.
And so, wherever you sit in an

00:24:05.187 --> 00:24:09.178
expanding geometry,
every object you see will be

00:24:09.178 --> 00:24:13.491
moving directly away from you.
And the further away it is,

00:24:13.491 --> 00:24:16.460
the faster it will be moving,
which is Hubble's law.

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:30.230
Oh, and one other thing about
this nice analogy,

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:33.632
here.
Let us imagine for a second

00:24:33.632 --> 00:24:39.782
that this tiny piece of a tiny
Universe is actually not a flat

00:24:39.782 --> 00:24:42.349
plane,
but is sitting on a curved

00:24:42.349 --> 00:24:46.180
surface, which is curved all the
way round into a big ball.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.940
That's actually not so hard to
imagine because it's true.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.500
This sits on the surface of the
Earth.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.922
And so, what is happening when
this thing blows up by 20% is,

00:24:55.922 --> 00:25:00.566
basically, somebody has taken a
valve to the Earth and has blown

00:25:00.566 --> 00:25:05.160
the Earth up by a factor of 20%.
And that would have this effect.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:09.143
And it would have the exact
same effect everywhere else on

00:25:09.143 --> 00:25:12.430
the surface of the Earth.
And the Earth,

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:18.329
you know--where is the center
of the surface of the Earth?

00:25:18.329 --> 00:25:21.054
You can answer the question:
"Where is the center of the

00:25:21.054 --> 00:25:22.635
Earth?"
But you can't answer the

00:25:22.635 --> 00:25:25.519
question of where is the center
of the surface of the Earth.

00:25:25.519 --> 00:25:28.556
Because wherever you sit,
whether you're sitting at

00:25:28.556 --> 00:25:31.969
Starbucks or in Phelps Gate or,
you know, in Los Angeles

00:25:31.969 --> 00:25:34.904
somewhere or wherever,
if they blow the Earth up by

00:25:34.904 --> 00:25:37.839
20% you're going to see this
exact same effect.

00:25:37.839 --> 00:25:39.460
Everything will be moving away
from you.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.310
The further away something is
the faster it will be moving.

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:50.150
So that's the one--yes,
go ahead.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.850
Student: Someone in the
back apparently [inaudible]

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:54.603
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yeah,

00:25:54.603 --> 00:25:56.389
talk.
Student: If something's

00:25:56.389 --> 00:25:59.064
far enough away from you would
it appear to be moving at the

00:25:59.064 --> 00:26:00.560
speed of light?
Professor Charles

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.819
Bailyn: Yes,
yes, good question.

00:26:01.819 --> 00:26:04.834
If something's far away from
you, will it appear to be moving

00:26:04.834 --> 00:26:06.929
at the speed of light?
Yes, it will,

00:26:06.929 --> 00:26:10.489
and that's one of the
fundamental differences between

00:26:10.489 --> 00:26:14.869
the motion of an object due to
what's called the Hubble Flow,

00:26:14.869 --> 00:26:18.849
due to the expansion,
and ordinary motion of objects.

00:26:18.849 --> 00:26:21.863
Now, if something's moving
faster than the speed of light,

00:26:21.863 --> 00:26:25.375
of course, you can't see it,
because the light from that is

00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:28.839
redshifted down to greater than
infinite wavelengths.

00:26:28.839 --> 00:26:31.400
So, the photons don't have any
energy left.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.410
But, let me come back to the
question after I do one more

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:35.720
thing.
That's a good question.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.400
Here's the thing I want to do.
So, we've had the

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.460
one-dimensional case,
the circle.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.480
We've had the two-dimensional
case, the expanding sphere.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.799
Of course, what we want is the
three-dimensional space.

00:26:47.799 --> 00:26:50.150
Okay, here we are in three
dimensions.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:53.541
Someone is expanding the
Universe, so everywhere we look,

00:26:53.541 --> 00:26:57.175
everything is going away from
us, and the further away it is,

00:26:57.175 --> 00:27:01.839
the faster it's going.
What's it expanding into?

00:27:01.839 --> 00:27:04.507
Well, that, we have a little
more trouble visualizing,

00:27:04.507 --> 00:27:06.092
right?
Because in one dimension,

00:27:06.092 --> 00:27:08.740
you can visualize this circle
expanding onto the plane.

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.761
In two dimensions,
you can imagine this spherical

00:27:11.761 --> 00:27:14.077
surface expanding.
In three dimensions,

00:27:14.077 --> 00:27:16.350
we can't imagine what it's
expanding into.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:20.105
That's beyond us.
And so, having had this failure

00:27:20.105 --> 00:27:22.690
of the imagination,
what do you do?

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:25.819
You resort to mathematics.
That's what we always do.

00:27:25.819 --> 00:27:33.167
And so, imagine that every
object has a position,

00:27:33.167 --> 00:27:39.289
which is denoted by three
coordinates,

00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:44.132
three spatial coordinates
x, y,

00:27:44.132 --> 00:27:49.195
and z. But now,
let's imagine that every

00:27:49.195 --> 00:27:55.469
object's position has this
coordinate system times a scale

00:27:55.469 --> 00:27:58.410
factor,
which is a function of T.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:06.080
So, it's a scale factor times a
coordinate position.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:15.006
And there are two ways that
things can change their

00:28:15.006 --> 00:28:17.509
position.
One is, they can move;

00:28:17.509 --> 00:28:19.259
they can change their x,
y, z position.

00:28:19.259 --> 00:28:21.965
This is the equivalent of
somebody walking across the Old

00:28:21.965 --> 00:28:24.025
Campus.
You walk from Starbucks to

00:28:24.025 --> 00:28:27.839
Phelps Gate, or something like
that, and you change your x,

00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:31.339
y, z coordinate position by
moving through space.

00:28:31.339 --> 00:28:36.244
So, changes in position,
which is to say,

00:28:36.244 --> 00:28:41.640
velocity, can be accomplished
in two ways.

00:28:47.869 --> 00:28:53.703
One is motion through the
coordinate system--that is to

00:28:53.703 --> 00:28:58.780
say, changing your x,
y, and z.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:03.099
This is called peculiar motion.
That's a jargon.

00:29:03.099 --> 00:29:07.172
And it's called peculiar
because one object can have a

00:29:07.172 --> 00:29:10.630
different peculiar motion from
every other.

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:13.136
It's peculiar in the
old-fashioned sense meaning

00:29:13.136 --> 00:29:16.199
specific to one object.
So, you have a peculiar motion

00:29:16.199 --> 00:29:18.976
that's all your own.
I have one that's all mine as

00:29:18.976 --> 00:29:21.299
we move through x,
y, and z.

00:29:21.299 --> 00:29:27.549
But the other is just the
effect of the change.

00:29:27.549 --> 00:29:30.704
And in particular,
in the case of the current

00:29:30.704 --> 00:29:33.930
Universe, the increase in the
scale factor.

00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:45.444
And these two kinds of velocity
are conceptually different from

00:29:45.444 --> 00:29:48.980
each other.
Because you don't have to do

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:52.580
anything to change your position
in this way.

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.349
You just sit there.
You don't expend any energy.

00:29:55.349 --> 00:29:59.317
You don't have any requirement
to expend energy or to exert a

00:29:59.317 --> 00:30:03.152
force or to do any of these
things that we ordinarily do to

00:30:03.152 --> 00:30:06.285
change our position.
You just sit there and the

00:30:06.285 --> 00:30:09.140
Universe expands you,
or expands your position.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.932
And that's why,
going back to your question,

00:30:11.932 --> 00:30:15.633
that's why it's possible for
this kind of velocity to turn

00:30:15.633 --> 00:30:18.619
out to be greater than the speed
of light,

00:30:18.619 --> 00:30:21.804
if it's far enough away,
whereas, it's not possible

00:30:21.804 --> 00:30:24.056
here.
What the effect of having this

00:30:24.056 --> 00:30:27.490
kind of velocity be faster than
the speed of light does,

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:30.652
is it makes the object
impossible to see,

00:30:30.652 --> 00:30:35.002
because photons coming off them
would be redshifted into

00:30:35.002 --> 00:30:38.163
oblivion.
And so, you can't actually see

00:30:38.163 --> 00:30:40.407
them.
And this imposes a kind of

00:30:40.407 --> 00:30:43.832
cosmic event horizon,
similar in kind to the event

00:30:43.832 --> 00:30:47.411
horizons around black holes.
You can't see events on the

00:30:47.411 --> 00:30:52.164
other side of these horizons.
All right, let me go backwards

00:30:52.164 --> 00:30:56.479
in time.
Back in time to when this scale

00:30:56.479 --> 00:31:01.140
factor A of T is
equal to 0.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.852
So, if the scale factor is
expanding, you know,

00:31:03.852 --> 00:31:06.269
the Old Campus,
whatever, is expanding,

00:31:06.269 --> 00:31:09.603
and you reverse time and you
think about what happened long

00:31:09.603 --> 00:31:13.126
ago, it must have been smaller.
So this A factor must

00:31:13.126 --> 00:31:16.184
have been smaller.
And if you go back a sufficient

00:31:16.184 --> 00:31:19.020
amount in time,
you go back to the point where

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.078
A is equal to 0.
So then, what does the Old

00:31:22.078 --> 00:31:25.609
Campus look like?
Looks like this, right?

00:31:25.609 --> 00:31:32.457
It's all been--imagine I take a
Xerox machine and I de-magnify

00:31:32.457 --> 00:31:37.060
the thing down to 0% of its
original size,

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:40.539
or 0 plus epsilon,
perhaps.

00:31:40.539 --> 00:31:43.370
What does that little diagram
look like?

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:46.814
It looks like a tiny little dot.
A single point,

00:31:46.814 --> 00:31:51.380
except it isn't a single point.
What it is, is it's many points

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:55.129
superposed on each other.
And not only is the Old Campus

00:31:55.129 --> 00:31:58.608
in there--imagine you've taken
this sphere that is the Earth

00:31:58.608 --> 00:32:00.849
and collapsed its radius down to
0.

00:32:00.849 --> 00:32:04.439
Not only the Old Campus is
there, but so is the rest of New

00:32:04.439 --> 00:32:06.930
Haven, so is Connecticut,
so is Los Angeles,

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:09.210
so is the whole rest of the
surface of the Earth.

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:14.075
All of the points that will
eventually make the surface of

00:32:14.075 --> 00:32:17.660
the Earth are superposed on one
another.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:22.469
And yet, the whole geometry of
the Earth, of the Old Campus,

00:32:22.469 --> 00:32:26.789
whatever, is already somehow
encoded in that point.

00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:31.200
Because, you know,
you're taking 0 times x,

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.529
y, z for every
point.

00:32:34.529 --> 00:32:39.070
But then, if you increase this
so that it becomes epsilon or

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:41.872
some non-zero number,
times x,

00:32:41.872 --> 00:32:45.932
y, z, then you
already get the geometry of the

00:32:45.932 --> 00:32:50.200
Old Campus and everything else
on the surface of the Earth.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:55.013
So, it is wrong to think of the
Big Bang as starting at a point

00:32:55.013 --> 00:32:59.250
and expanding into space.
That's kind of the impression

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:01.759
that word the Big Bang gives
you.

00:33:01.759 --> 00:33:04.128
And you think,
naturally enough,

00:33:04.128 --> 00:33:07.337
of an explosion,
where something at a point

00:33:07.337 --> 00:33:10.809
explodes into empty space.
But that's not right.

00:33:10.809 --> 00:33:13.620
All the space,
all the empty space is

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:17.069
contained in that point.
It's all in there.

00:33:17.069 --> 00:33:21.154
It's just, it's all multiplied
by 0, so it all comes out to be

00:33:21.154 --> 00:33:23.900
on top of each other in the same
place.

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:30.529
How are we doing?
Wonderful.

00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:36.023
Okay, that's the essence of the
Big Bang--the whole idea of the

00:33:36.023 --> 00:33:41.340
Big Bang--that what is happening
is that the whole coordinate

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:46.480
system of the Universe is
multiplied by this constant.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.710
And that constant changes in
time.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:54.792
It gets bigger.
And that fact is inferred from

00:33:54.792 --> 00:33:59.319
the observations of these
galaxies.

00:33:59.319 --> 00:34:02.230
That you observe galaxies,
and that they're moving away

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:04.156
from us.
But more than that--that

00:34:04.156 --> 00:34:07.449
there's a linear relationship
between how far away from us

00:34:07.449 --> 00:34:09.760
they are and how fast they're
moving.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.440
That implies this kind of
coordinate expansion.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:18.463
And if you run it in reverse,
it implies an origin to the

00:34:18.463 --> 00:34:22.500
Universe at some specific time
in the past.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.171
All right.
Let's have questions.

00:34:24.171 --> 00:34:25.900
I'll tell you what.
Talk to each other.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:30.369
Come up with good questions,
and remember how we do this.

00:34:30.369 --> 00:34:33.071
When you come up with a
question--a question can be

00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:35.989
either to explain some of this
or to expand upon it.

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:37.940
When you're ready with a
question, put your hand up.

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.707
I'll answer a few of them while
other people are getting their

00:34:40.707 --> 00:34:43.403
questions together.
And then we'll answer as many

00:34:43.403 --> 00:34:46.950
of them as we have time for in
the remainder of the class.

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:48.989
So, talk to each other.
Talk amongst yourselves.

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:51.130
Come up with a question,
any question.

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:54.889
All questions are good,
and see what you can do.

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:56.880
I'll come around and try and
answer some of these.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:00.193
Yeah – so,
talk to each other by all

00:35:00.193 --> 00:35:01.400
means.
Yes?

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.683
Student: There is a
center of the Universe,

00:35:02.683 --> 00:35:03.322
isn't there?
Professor Charles

00:35:03.322 --> 00:35:04.841
Bailyn: No.
Student: Well,

00:35:04.841 --> 00:35:07.381
I mean, like,
there's got to be a point in

00:35:07.381 --> 00:35:10.514
the Universe at which,
like, all other points--or all

00:35:10.514 --> 00:35:13.366
other points that are furthest
away from that point are

00:35:13.366 --> 00:35:15.110
expanding equally fast,
right?

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:15.900
Professor Charles
Bailyn: No.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.780
Well, that's true of every
point in the Universe.

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.320
That's true of every point in
the Universe.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:24.046
If you're sitting on the statue
of Pierson, everything at the

00:35:24.046 --> 00:35:27.710
same distance is moving away
from you by the same amount.

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:29.599
That's true of every point.
Student: Oh, I see.

00:35:29.599 --> 00:35:30.369
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yeah.

00:35:30.369 --> 00:35:32.060
Student: So,
wait, so, like,

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:33.602
is it, like,
in four dimensions,

00:35:33.602 --> 00:35:34.886
then?
Professor Charles

00:35:34.886 --> 00:35:36.726
Bailyn: Imagine a
three-dimensional thing

00:35:36.726 --> 00:35:39.110
expanding into the fourth
dimension the way the surface of

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:41.579
a sphere expands into three.
Student: Okay, thank you.

00:35:41.579 --> 00:35:44.509
Student: If you switched
from the expansion to getting

00:35:44.509 --> 00:35:46.360
close together,
would it precipitate the point

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.481
at which the expansion
[inaudible]

00:35:47.481 --> 00:35:49.215
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Oh we'll talk about

00:35:49.215 --> 00:35:51.705
that later.
You can imagine that gravity is

00:35:51.705 --> 00:35:53.840
going to slow the expansion
down.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.774
But at the moment I'm just
thinking about running backwards

00:35:56.774 --> 00:35:57.842
in time.
Student: Okay,

00:35:57.842 --> 00:35:59.234
and at some point you got to do
expansion [inaudible]

00:35:59.234 --> 00:36:00.225
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yeah,

00:36:00.225 --> 00:36:03.900
or could.
Yeah?

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.671
Student: I don't
think--so have you had like one

00:36:05.671 --> 00:36:07.378
of those fake event horizons
where something could be

00:36:07.378 --> 00:36:09.380
like--appear to be moving faster
than the speed of light?

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:11.897
Could you then like--in like a
normal event horizon you can't

00:36:11.897 --> 00:36:13.575
pass information between them
[inaudible]

00:36:13.575 --> 00:36:15.380
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Right.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.480
Student: But could you,
like relay information?

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.398
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yes,

00:36:19.398 --> 00:36:22.170
but by the time you had done
that--that is to say,

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:25.582
the Universe is expanding
faster than the information

00:36:25.582 --> 00:36:27.656
would get to you.
So, you know,

00:36:27.656 --> 00:36:31.410
by the time you've moved your
information from here to here,

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:34.400
the distance from here to here
has expanded.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.560
And so, it's not actually
getting any closer.

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:47.699
Okay, let's have a few of these.
Yes, go ahead.

00:36:47.699 --> 00:36:49.924
Student: Well I
have--first, just simply,

00:36:49.924 --> 00:36:52.480
I didn't understand why it's 0
times the coordinate,

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.659
why there's a point at all and
why there's just nothing.

00:36:55.659 --> 00:36:59.087
Why there's not [inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:36:59.087 --> 00:37:00.909
Bailyn: Well,
okay.

00:37:00.909 --> 00:37:10.099
So, if A is equal to 0
here, then all events are at

00:37:10.099 --> 00:37:13.330
0,0, 0.
So, that point of 0,0,

00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:16.973
0 is occupied,
if you want to think of it that

00:37:16.973 --> 00:37:19.556
way.
It's the point--the point in

00:37:19.556 --> 00:37:21.789
question is the one at 0,0,
0.

00:37:21.789 --> 00:37:23.764
And if you have anything in
here times 0,

00:37:23.764 --> 00:37:25.639
that's where you're going to
end up.

00:37:25.639 --> 00:37:29.648
And as you go backwards and run
this scale factor down to 0 as

00:37:29.648 --> 00:37:32.079
you think about going back in
time,

00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:39.489
everything's going to end up
closer and closer to 0.

00:37:39.489 --> 00:37:41.661
And then, at the moment when
this equals 0,

00:37:41.661 --> 00:37:43.420
it's all piled on top of
itself.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:47.880
Does that make sense?
Yeah go ahead.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:53.038
Student: Everything has
to be equidistant [Inaudible]

00:37:53.038 --> 00:37:56.098
Professor Charles
Bailyn: No,

00:37:56.098 --> 00:37:59.471
no, no, no, no.
Imagine-- Student:

00:37:59.471 --> 00:38:01.594
[Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:38:01.594 --> 00:38:04.470
Bailyn: Oh,
in the other dimension.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:05.583
Student: Yes.
Professor Charles

00:38:05.583 --> 00:38:06.199
Bailyn: Yeah,
okay.

00:38:06.199 --> 00:38:08.540
In the higher dimension,
that's true.

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:12.874
Well, okay, let me back off.
That's true if you have

00:38:12.874 --> 00:38:16.399
constant curvature.
You could imagine something

00:38:16.399 --> 00:38:18.304
that, you know,
looks like this,

00:38:18.304 --> 00:38:21.070
that also expands in exactly
the same way.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:24.370
And what creates the curvature
of space-time?

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:26.859
Gravity.
And so, we're going to end up

00:38:26.859 --> 00:38:30.741
in a situation where we're going
to be able to determine what the

00:38:30.741 --> 00:38:34.260
curvature of space is by seeing
how much mass there is.

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.889
So, this actually relates back
to part two of the course.

00:38:36.889 --> 00:38:39.059
Student: So,
is that why time could move

00:38:39.059 --> 00:38:40.265
differently?
Professor Charles

00:38:40.265 --> 00:38:41.462
Bailyn: Huh?
Student: Time could move

00:38:41.462 --> 00:38:42.173
differently.
Professor Charles

00:38:42.173 --> 00:38:43.100
Bailyn: Time could move
differently, too.

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:46.949
Yep.
Yes?

00:38:46.949 --> 00:38:50.007
Student: Isn't--in the
one-dimensional circle and you

00:38:50.007 --> 00:38:53.323
said that thing's expanding to a
higher dimension--what does that

00:38:53.323 --> 00:38:54.153
mean?
Professor Charles

00:38:54.153 --> 00:38:55.475
Bailyn: Okay.
So, imagine you're a

00:38:55.475 --> 00:38:58.409
one-dimensional creature.
You can only go on a line.

00:38:58.409 --> 00:39:00.481
But your line,
unbeknownst to you,

00:39:00.481 --> 00:39:02.930
is curved, so that it ends on
itself.

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:07.190
That then--the line expands.
The circle expands.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:10.556
What do you think is happening?
You think suddenly all the

00:39:10.556 --> 00:39:13.131
distances are greater,
but you can't perceive what

00:39:13.131 --> 00:39:15.419
it's expanding into,
because that's a second

00:39:15.419 --> 00:39:18.000
dimension, and you're
constrained to move on the line.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.924
Similarly, if you're an ant,
or something moving on the

00:39:20.924 --> 00:39:23.883
surface of the Earth,
and you have no understanding

00:39:23.883 --> 00:39:26.659
that there's up and down,
and the Earth suddenly

00:39:26.659 --> 00:39:30.382
increases in size,
you have no perception of the

00:39:30.382 --> 00:39:34.005
dimension you're moving into.
Student: So then,

00:39:34.005 --> 00:39:36.030
they just keep moving into
higher dimensions?

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.875
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Well,

00:39:37.875 --> 00:39:40.469
our perception is of a
three-dimensional Universe.

00:39:40.469 --> 00:39:44.298
So, if you say,
okay, what happens when the

00:39:44.298 --> 00:39:47.706
scale factor gets bigger?
You can write it down

00:39:47.706 --> 00:39:49.598
mathematically into all these
calculations,

00:39:49.598 --> 00:39:52.552
and what you have to imagine,
if you want to have a

00:39:52.552 --> 00:39:56.370
conceptual understanding of
this, is that there's some

00:39:56.370 --> 00:40:00.477
fourth spatial dimension into
which this three-dimensional

00:40:00.477 --> 00:40:03.739
space is moving into.
But we can't perceive that.

00:40:03.739 --> 00:40:06.113
So, it's better to do it
mathematically,

00:40:06.113 --> 00:40:09.277
because it's hard on the brain
to imagine that fourth

00:40:09.277 --> 00:40:11.818
dimension.
And there's basically two ways

00:40:11.818 --> 00:40:14.300
to think about this.
One is by analogy.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.204
You think of the
one-dimensional creature and

00:40:16.204 --> 00:40:18.110
what it thinks about the second
dimension,

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:20.028
or the two-dimensional
creature--what it thinks about

00:40:20.028 --> 00:40:21.839
the third dimension.
And then, you just,

00:40:21.839 --> 00:40:24.733
sort of, take this leap of
faith into us moving into the

00:40:24.733 --> 00:40:26.511
fourth.
Or, you have to write things

00:40:26.511 --> 00:40:28.582
down mathematically.
Those are the only two options

00:40:28.582 --> 00:40:30.689
you have.
Actually picturing this is not

00:40:30.689 --> 00:40:33.039
going to happen.
Yes?

00:40:33.039 --> 00:40:36.732
Student: If we were to
speed up this process would we

00:40:36.732 --> 00:40:40.050
be able to see things getting
farther away from us?

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:40.888
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Ah,

00:40:40.888 --> 00:40:43.182
interesting question.
Would we, if we cranked up this

00:40:43.182 --> 00:40:44.924
process some,
would we actually,

00:40:44.924 --> 00:40:48.353
you know, be able to take out
our tape measure and notice that

00:40:48.353 --> 00:40:51.670
the distance between here and
Starbucks has increased?

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:53.869
No.
Here's why.

00:40:53.869 --> 00:40:57.826
We are not--we--that is to say,
you, me, our bodies,

00:40:57.826 --> 00:41:02.713
whatever--are not participating
in the expansion of the Universe

00:41:02.713 --> 00:41:05.070
at the moment.
Why?

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:08.389
Because the molecules in our
body are being held together by

00:41:08.389 --> 00:41:12.530
other forces--chemical forces.
We are being--the Earth is held

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:17.134
together by gravitational forces
and those forces have stopped

00:41:17.134 --> 00:41:20.230
the expansion of the Universe
locally,

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:23.384
but not globally.
And that's why you have to go

00:41:23.384 --> 00:41:25.099
out and measure this stuff with
galaxies.

00:41:25.099 --> 00:41:30.010
Otherwise, you'd be able to,
you know, measure it with this.

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:31.745
Now, of course,
then, there's the problem,

00:41:31.745 --> 00:41:33.820
the ruler also expands,
all this kind of stuff.

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.958
But, in fact,
what happens is that

00:41:36.958 --> 00:41:40.667
locally--local objects,
by which I mean,

00:41:40.667 --> 00:41:45.993
our own galaxy and anything
smaller, are held together by

00:41:45.993 --> 00:41:49.310
other forces.
Picture a balloon expanding,

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:52.440
so that's the two-dimensional
case, this balloon expands.

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:55.329
And put a bunch of leather
patches on the balloon.

00:41:55.329 --> 00:41:58.644
So, those leather patches don't
expand, but the distance

00:41:58.644 --> 00:42:02.260
between--because they're held
together by something else--but

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:05.610
the distance between them does.
Yes?

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:07.510
Student: So,
what causes the expansion?

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:09.182
Professor Charles
Bailyn: What causes the

00:42:09.182 --> 00:42:12.250
expansion?
Oh, that's theology.

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:16.289
No, no, seriously,
it's an initial condition.

00:42:16.289 --> 00:42:22.970
Something at the start,
at T equals 0,

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:28.701
where this A is 0.
So, you're starting with

00:42:28.701 --> 00:42:32.712
A of--with this scale
factor of 0, but the derivative

00:42:32.712 --> 00:42:34.263
isn't 0.
It's expanding,

00:42:34.263 --> 00:42:36.280
A is increasing.
Why?

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:39.380
Why is it increasing by the
particular amount it is?

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:43.069
You have to think of that as
being a parameter of the

00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:45.084
Universe.
It's one of the things about

00:42:45.084 --> 00:42:46.760
the--sort of like the speed of
light.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:50.790
Why is that the quantity it is?
Or why is the gravitational

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:55.233
constant the value it is?
It's one of the parameters that

00:42:55.233 --> 00:42:59.989
governs our Universe.
Why those particular parameters?

00:42:59.989 --> 00:43:05.330
That's not quite a science
question, and we don't know.

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:07.481
You can turn it around.
You can make the following

00:43:07.481 --> 00:43:09.620
interesting point.
If it wasn't expanding at

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:13.054
approximately the rate it is,
we wouldn't be here to notice

00:43:13.054 --> 00:43:15.995
it.
Because if it was expanding a

00:43:15.995 --> 00:43:20.274
whole lot slower,
then it would never have gotten

00:43:20.274 --> 00:43:23.840
big enough for stars to condense
out.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:27.917
If it was expanding a whole lot
faster, all the atoms would be

00:43:27.917 --> 00:43:31.659
spread out so far that,
again, stars could never form.

00:43:31.659 --> 00:43:34.214
So, you can make this
interesting argument that while

00:43:34.214 --> 00:43:36.670
you don't know why it has this
particular value,

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:39.837
it's very important that it
does, because otherwise we

00:43:39.837 --> 00:43:43.551
wouldn't be here to observe it.
This is a form of argumentation

00:43:43.551 --> 00:43:47.470
called the anthropic principle.
It is highly debated among

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:52.120
scientists whether this is a
scientific argument or not.

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:55.059
But it's amusing either way.
So--yes?

00:43:55.059 --> 00:43:57.735
Student: So if
derivative A is positive,

00:43:57.735 --> 00:44:00.309
then A should have been
0 for that, right?

00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:01.802
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Well,

00:44:01.802 --> 00:44:03.900
you go back before A and
you're in trouble.

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:05.690
So - Student: What's
that mean?

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:06.530
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Okay.

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:09.989
So, this is another one of
these un-questions.

00:44:09.989 --> 00:44:13.394
It's usually phrased as,
well, what happened before the

00:44:13.394 --> 00:44:16.679
Big Bang, right?
That's the equivalent question.

00:44:16.679 --> 00:44:20.400
And, again, that's a
theological question.

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.667
It's like asking the question:
"What's going on inside an

00:44:23.667 --> 00:44:25.970
event horizon?"
You can write down equations.

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:28.759
You can talk about it.
But it's un-testable by its

00:44:28.759 --> 00:44:31.628
very nature.
And so, something– This,

00:44:31.628 --> 00:44:35.396
by the way, is why the
Catholics like the Big Bang

00:44:35.396 --> 00:44:38.902
Theory so much.
In fact, the mathematics,

00:44:38.902 --> 00:44:43.827
the relativistic mathematics
that describe the Big Bang and

00:44:43.827 --> 00:44:48.973
the expansion of the Universe,
were worked out by a man named

00:44:48.973 --> 00:44:53.269
Lemaitre, who was a Catholic
priest, who was a Jesuit.

00:44:53.269 --> 00:44:58.539
They love this because it gives
you a creation moment.

00:44:58.539 --> 00:45:01.471
It kind of gives you a
scientifically verified creation

00:45:01.471 --> 00:45:03.880
moment.
John Paul was very enthusiastic

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.454
about astrophysics.
He used to throw big

00:45:06.454 --> 00:45:10.190
conferences in the Vatican,
give after-dinner speeches.

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:12.932
There's a thing called the
Vatican Astrophysical

00:45:12.932 --> 00:45:14.950
Observatory.
They have a bunch of Jesuits.

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:17.840
They run a telescope in Arizona.
They do research into this.

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:21.956
And so, you know,
if you want to see science and

00:45:21.956 --> 00:45:25.722
religion converge,
you want to run away from

00:45:25.722 --> 00:45:30.889
biology as fast you can and talk
to us about cosmology.

00:45:30.889 --> 00:45:34.037
And what I don't understand is
why the, sort of,

00:45:34.037 --> 00:45:37.184
fundamentalist type worry so
much about biology,

00:45:37.184 --> 00:45:40.599
where all the science is
dead-set against them.

00:45:40.599 --> 00:45:42.935
Whereas, in the case of
astrophysics--now,

00:45:42.935 --> 00:45:46.126
of course, it is possible,
if you take an atheistic point

00:45:46.126 --> 00:45:48.181
of view,
to come up with all kinds of

00:45:48.181 --> 00:45:50.239
clever ways to avoid this
creation event.

00:45:50.239 --> 00:45:54.559
But again, it stops being
science at a certain point.

00:45:54.559 --> 00:45:57.893
It becomes another odd kind of
theology, and we'll talk about

00:45:57.893 --> 00:45:59.559
that, perhaps,
a little bit.

00:45:59.559 --> 00:46:03.723
But if you want a place where
science turned out to be the

00:46:03.723 --> 00:46:05.550
congruent to,
at least,

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:08.355
certain kinds of
non-fundamentalist religious

00:46:08.355 --> 00:46:12.244
beliefs, you're way better off
in astrophysics than you are in

00:46:12.244 --> 00:46:16.360
biology.
Yeah, go ahead.

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:18.421
Student: Back to the
fourth dimension,

00:46:18.421 --> 00:46:20.670
is that a time dimension or a
space dimension?

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:21.716
Professor Charles
Bailyn: No,

00:46:21.716 --> 00:46:23.361
that's a fourth spatial
dimension that I'm talking about

00:46:23.361 --> 00:46:25.043
in this case.
Student: So,

00:46:25.043 --> 00:46:27.759
in other words,
spatial dimension [Inaudible]

00:46:27.759 --> 00:46:30.908
Professor Charles
Bailyn: It's expanding into

00:46:30.908 --> 00:46:33.440
a dimension which we don't
perceive.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.281
Or, at least,
that's one way of

00:46:35.281 --> 00:46:39.138
conceptualizing it.
We don't get to deal with that

00:46:39.138 --> 00:46:42.349
dimension.
So, again, it's a concept.

00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:46.570
It's not necessarily a physical
thing.

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:49.021
Yes?
Student: Back to that

00:46:49.021 --> 00:46:51.251
one point, I was just wondering,
is that like anything that will

00:46:51.251 --> 00:46:52.525
ever [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:46:52.525 --> 00:46:55.101
Bailyn: Right.
Student: [inaudible]

00:46:55.101 --> 00:46:57.449
and anything that will ever
expand?

00:46:57.449 --> 00:46:58.019
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yeah,

00:46:58.019 --> 00:46:59.349
yeah, yeah.
It has to be.

00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:02.769
Think of all the points that
now exist in the Universe.

00:47:02.769 --> 00:47:09.346
Multiply them by 0,
and they're all on top of each

00:47:09.346 --> 00:47:11.480
other.
Yes?

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:13.435
Student: So if you were
to go really,

00:47:13.435 --> 00:47:15.710
really fast in a straight line
in any direction,

00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:17.487
would it eventually end at a
[Inaudible]

00:47:17.487 --> 00:47:19.219
Professor Charles
Bailyn: So,

00:47:19.219 --> 00:47:22.750
this is the question of what is
the curvature of the Universe.

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:24.490
Is it, in fact,
like this analogy,

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:26.969
with the circle or the surface
of the sphere.

00:47:26.969 --> 00:47:29.311
If you go forever,
do you come back to where you

00:47:29.311 --> 00:47:30.934
are?
That depends on what the

00:47:30.934 --> 00:47:33.750
overall curvature of the
Universe turns out to be.

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:37.737
That depends on how much mass
it contains, because mass curves

00:47:37.737 --> 00:47:40.221
space.
And so, that is a question

00:47:40.221 --> 00:47:46.139
that's empirically answerable.
We think the answer is no.

00:47:46.139 --> 00:47:48.315
In any case,
though, it would take you

00:47:48.315 --> 00:47:51.901
longer, at the speed of light,
than the age of the Universe to

00:47:51.901 --> 00:47:54.727
accomplish it.
So, even if it were positively

00:47:54.727 --> 00:47:57.377
curved, in this sense that it
rejoined itself,

00:47:57.377 --> 00:48:00.500
you wouldn't actually be able
to make that voyage.

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:03.628
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:48:03.628 --> 00:48:06.744
Bailyn: No.
Student: [Inaudible]

00:48:06.744 --> 00:48:09.464
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Well,

00:48:09.464 --> 00:48:12.699
you might, eventually,
unless the Universe is

00:48:12.699 --> 00:48:15.639
expanding faster than you can
move.

00:48:15.639 --> 00:48:18.851
This goes back to the question
of can parts of it expand faster

00:48:18.851 --> 00:48:21.390
than the speed of light,
and the answer is yes.

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:23.656
So, yeah.
You take off on this voyage to

00:48:23.656 --> 00:48:26.291
the back of your own head.
Going in that direction,

00:48:26.291 --> 00:48:29.087
you're going to end up
here--except the Universe is

00:48:29.087 --> 00:48:31.099
expanding faster than you can
go,

00:48:31.099 --> 00:48:34.660
and so, you don't necessarily
end up back there.

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:36.294
Yes?
Student: How does the

00:48:36.294 --> 00:48:37.019
Big Crunch happen in the
expansion?

00:48:37.019 --> 00:48:39.543
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Oh,

00:48:39.543 --> 00:48:43.291
one of the things that we
haven't talked about is the

00:48:43.291 --> 00:48:47.440
expansion rate constant.
Might it be that the Universe

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:50.380
is expanding,
but perhaps slowing down?

00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:52.450
Why would it slow down?
It's full of mass.

00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:55.384
Gravity slows things down.
And so, in principle,

00:48:55.384 --> 00:48:58.496
if you've got enough mass,
the Universe will stop,

00:48:58.496 --> 00:49:00.719
turn around,
and fall backwards.

00:49:00.719 --> 00:49:04.024
And you can compute from--we
will compute,

00:49:04.024 --> 00:49:07.490
next period,
how fast you have to go to make

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:09.377
that happen.
Or contrary,

00:49:09.377 --> 00:49:11.619
how dense the Universe has to
be to stop it.

00:49:11.619 --> 00:49:15.690
And so, what you expect is the
Universe is slowing down.

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:18.126
Because you know you don't know
how much it's slowing down,

00:49:18.126 --> 00:49:19.847
whether it will stop the
expansion or not,

00:49:19.847 --> 00:49:21.570
but you expect it to be slowing
down.

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:24.019
The punch line of this whole
part of the course,

00:49:24.019 --> 00:49:26.260
in order to anticipate where
we're going,

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:29.011
is that, in fact,
we can measure the change in

00:49:29.011 --> 00:49:31.640
the expansion rate,
and it's speeding up,

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:35.225
not slowing down.
This is very disturbing,

00:49:35.225 --> 00:49:38.109
because it means there's some
kind of pervasive cosmic

00:49:38.109 --> 00:49:40.548
anti-gravity,
which we call dark energy,

00:49:40.548 --> 00:49:42.599
because we don't know what it
is.

00:49:42.599 --> 00:49:45.648
And that's basically the punch
line of this whole section of

00:49:45.648 --> 00:49:48.486
the course.
But you could imagine that

00:49:48.486 --> 00:49:51.736
there is a change in the
expansion rate,

00:49:51.736 --> 00:49:55.654
either positive or negative,
and that, therefore,

00:49:55.654 --> 00:49:58.390
various different outcomes are
possible.

00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:00.323
Yeah?
Student: Would a

00:50:00.323 --> 00:50:02.691
hypothetical of the Big Crunch
be sort of different from Big

00:50:02.691 --> 00:50:05.099
Bang in that the Big Bang sort
of expanded the whole geometry

00:50:05.099 --> 00:50:07.387
of the Universe where as the Big
Crunch being motivated by

00:50:07.387 --> 00:50:09.233
gravity would only cause the
object [inaudible]

00:50:09.233 --> 00:50:11.040
Professor Charles
Bailyn: No,

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:14.310
no, no, no, no.
It turns out it--you might

00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:16.730
imagine that,
but you'd be wrong.

00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:20.178
It turns out that this scale
factor--you can write down a

00:50:20.178 --> 00:50:22.949
differential equation for the
scale factor,

00:50:22.949 --> 00:50:26.642
and that it's the scale factor
that stops, turns around and

00:50:26.642 --> 00:50:29.576
comes back.
Now, it is the case that when

00:50:29.576 --> 00:50:32.553
it's going out,
the particular objects the

00:50:32.553 --> 00:50:37.420
Universe contains are different
because of the peculiar motions.

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:41.085
It starts out much more evenly
spread, and then gradually stuff

00:50:41.085 --> 00:50:44.160
accumulates due to gravity,
and you get--when you're coming

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.916
back, you get a lot of
individual points,

00:50:45.916 --> 00:50:47.980
rather than a smooth
distribution of matter.

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:50.128
But that has to do with
peculiar motions,

00:50:50.128 --> 00:50:52.329
not the overall motion of the
Universe.

00:50:52.329 --> 00:50:55.810
One more and then we got to
continue this next time.

00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:59.117
Yes, go ahead.
Student: Before the Big

00:50:59.117 --> 00:51:02.521
Bang, what happens when the
minus--negative number did

00:51:02.521 --> 00:51:04.512
[Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:51:04.512 --> 00:51:07.501
Bailyn: Right.
So, before the Big Bang,

00:51:07.501 --> 00:51:10.650
can you put a negative number
into that A?

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:14.219
This gets you into exactly the
same kind of mathematical

00:51:14.219 --> 00:51:17.269
difficulty as moving inside an
event horizon.

00:51:17.269 --> 00:51:20.739
You can actually write down a
metric for the whole Universe

00:51:20.739 --> 00:51:23.670
and you change all the signs
when that happens.

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:27.059
And you get into a very similar
kind of problem.

00:51:27.059 --> 00:51:30.597
So, mathematically,
you could compute a bunch of

00:51:30.597 --> 00:51:33.699
stuff.
The physical meaning of that is

00:51:33.699 --> 00:51:37.570
not--first of all,
the fact that that mathematics

00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:42.650
actually works in the real world
is impossible to determine,

00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:47.642
and the physical nature of
consequences of that are

00:51:47.642 --> 00:51:51.000
questionable.
All right, stop.

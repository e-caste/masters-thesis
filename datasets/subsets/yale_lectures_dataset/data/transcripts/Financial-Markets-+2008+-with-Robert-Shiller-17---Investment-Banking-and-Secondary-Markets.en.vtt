00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.970
Professor Robert
Shiller: I wanted to talk

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.411
today about investment banking,
which is a subject of some

00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:14.672
interest around here.
First, I thought I

00:00:14.672 --> 00:00:19.040
would--there's been so much
news;

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.070
I want to just briefly comment
about what's going on in the

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.230
world today with our financial
crisis.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.723
Notably, I think that this is
the--it could be the biggest

00:00:34.723 --> 00:00:40.602
financial crisis since The Great
Depression and as evidence of

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:43.136
that,
we're seeing a lot of talk

00:00:43.136 --> 00:00:45.380
about what changes should be
made.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.697
I think it reminds me of the
very basic fact that we live in

00:00:49.697 --> 00:00:53.942
a financial world that was
created in the wake of The Great

00:00:53.942 --> 00:00:56.939
Depression.
So many of our financial

00:00:56.939 --> 00:01:01.765
institutions were created in the
1930s because that was a time

00:01:01.765 --> 00:01:06.829
when everything was being shaken
up and it was a time when people

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:11.340
were willing to consider
something really different.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.486
If you just look back where
various of our

00:01:14.486 --> 00:01:19.015
institutions--when they were
created--it's most likely to be

00:01:19.015 --> 00:01:23.533
in the 1930s.
We are not yet at such a

00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:27.583
crossroads.
The financial situation is not

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:32.388
as bad as it was in the 1930s,
but it's getting bad and as a

00:01:32.388 --> 00:01:37.030
result we're starting to see
proposals for big change.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.891
Notably, on Monday,
the Treasury Department,

00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:45.739
under Secretary Henry Paulson,
announced a proposal for

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:50.050
fundamental change in our
financial markets.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.519
This proposal,
if implemented,

00:01:53.519 --> 00:02:00.340
might be the biggest change
since The Great Depression.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.260
However, the news is calling it
dead on arrival;

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.112
it's unlikely that the Paulson
proposal will be implemented

00:02:12.112 --> 00:02:17.057
partly because it's being
proposed by a Republican

00:02:17.057 --> 00:02:20.656
administration--well,
not just Republican,

00:02:20.656 --> 00:02:23.616
just an administration that's
coming to an end and we're

00:02:23.616 --> 00:02:27.266
having an election.
This Paulson proposal probably

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:31.460
has very little chance of being
implemented as is,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.679
but it's put in to change the
discussion and it's going to be

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:42.419
talked about a lot and I suppose
it will influence what happens.

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:46.333
The interesting thing is that
the next President of the United

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:49.669
States will likely have a
mandate for big changes.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:54.250
Maybe it's just as well that
Fabozzi, et al.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.301
are slow to do a second edition
of their book because if they

00:02:57.301 --> 00:03:00.556
got it out this year it would be
a bad year to get it out because

00:03:00.556 --> 00:03:04.405
everything is changing.
I studied the Paulson proposal

00:03:04.405 --> 00:03:09.439
carefully, since I'm writing a
New York Times column about it,

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.397
which will appear Sunday.
Reading the various

00:03:13.397 --> 00:03:18.685
commentaries about the proposal,
I had the impression that not

00:03:18.685 --> 00:03:23.539
many of them are very--thinking
very deeply about it.

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:27.465
They typically--they like to
talk about the politics of it

00:03:27.465 --> 00:03:30.427
and this thing,
that it's dead on arrival or

00:03:30.427 --> 00:03:33.940
it's--someone said it's an
amateurish proposal.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.164
All the groups that stand to
win or lose from it are all

00:03:37.164 --> 00:03:40.388
figuring out what it does to
them and they're taking the

00:03:40.388 --> 00:03:45.015
positions out of self-interest.
So, I wanted to write something

00:03:45.015 --> 00:03:49.419
that was more perspicacious,
if I could manage that.

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:53.686
The interesting thing is,
actually everyone calls it the

00:03:53.686 --> 00:03:57.176
Paulson proposal,
but it was apparently mostly

00:03:57.176 --> 00:04:01.520
written by a young man who is in
his early thirties.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.640
You may not consider that
young, but I think that is

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.498
young.
He could have taken this course

00:04:06.498 --> 00:04:07.910
from me ten
years–actually,

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.150
he didn't go to Yale.
I looked it up;

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.178
he went to American University,
both undergraduate and--his

00:04:14.178 --> 00:04:17.303
name is David
Nason--undergraduate and then he

00:04:17.303 --> 00:04:20.360
got a law degree at American
University.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.490
Then he just went to work for
the government.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.089
As far as I know,
he doesn't publish;

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:29.379
he's not in the newspapers,
but he's gotten the ear of the

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:32.850
Treasury Secretary.
They spent many weekends

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.339
together figuring out what
should be done about the system

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:43.490
and they wrote up a proposal.
I like many aspects of it;

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.550
actually, it's an interesting
proposal.

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.694
It's not so much what's in the
proposal as it is that this is

00:04:54.694 --> 00:04:59.481
the time for reconsideration.
One interesting thing that they

00:04:59.481 --> 00:05:05.214
proposed is that we should have
what they call "objectives based

00:05:05.214 --> 00:05:06.580
regulation."

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.791
We have--this is David Nason
and Henry Paulson,

00:05:23.791 --> 00:05:30.157
although it's not signed by
them, it's signed by The

00:05:30.157 --> 00:05:35.055
Treasury.
So, The Treasury–it's

00:05:35.055 --> 00:05:40.878
called a blueprint,
a blueprint for reform of our

00:05:40.878 --> 00:05:43.790
financial regulation.

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:57.168
It's built around what they
call "objectives based

00:05:57.168 --> 00:06:01.799
regulation."
That means that the different

00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:05.786
regulators should each have
their own objective,

00:06:05.786 --> 00:06:09.009
so they have a three-part
proposal.

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:15.463
The market stability regulator,
which would make sure that the

00:06:15.463 --> 00:06:21.176
markets don't freeze up on
us--we don't have a systemic

00:06:21.176 --> 00:06:26.533
crisis.
There would be a prudential

00:06:26.533 --> 00:06:34.611
financial regulator and then,
three, there would be a

00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:43.465
business conduct regulator,
so that's the main part of the

00:06:43.465 --> 00:06:48.413
proposal.
What they're doing is

00:06:48.413 --> 00:06:55.279
emphasizing the different
objectives of regulators.

00:06:55.279 --> 00:07:00.106
The market stability is going
to be the Fed,

00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:05.675
but it's not just banking.
They want it to be--the Fed's

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:10.192
role would be broadened so that
it's not just a banking

00:07:10.192 --> 00:07:14.040
regulator, it's the whole
financial system.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.069
It's supposed to be maintaining
the stability of the system.

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:25.092
Then the prudential financial
regulator is supposed to

00:07:25.092 --> 00:07:32.379
regulate--it's supposed to aim
at protecting the U.S.

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:37.069
interest in various
institutions that are guaranteed

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:40.748
by the government,
such as banks that are

00:07:40.748 --> 00:07:46.541
federally-insured or enterprises
that have government guarantees

00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:50.220
or apparent government
guarantees,

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.677
like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Then the business conduct

00:07:55.677 --> 00:08:02.660
regulator is supposed to
regulate--what I saw is it would

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.149
be aimed at--consumer
protection;

00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:14.688
that it would make sure that
businesses are protecting

00:08:14.688 --> 00:08:20.141
individuals.
I find this interesting because

00:08:20.141 --> 00:08:25.948
it calls to mind some of the
problems we had with the

00:08:25.948 --> 00:08:30.744
subprime crisis.
One very important problem was,

00:08:30.744 --> 00:08:35.299
in the U.S.
we have regulation divided up

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:39.937
in crazy archaic ways.
Different agencies were formed

00:08:39.937 --> 00:08:43.139
at different times and they have
specific missions.

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:46.751
For example,
we have the Office of the

00:08:46.751 --> 00:08:53.018
Comptroller of the Currency.
The OCC was founded in 1863 to

00:08:53.018 --> 00:09:00.139
supervise national banks but it
only supervises national banks.

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:03.434
Well, why not state chartered
banks or why not credit unions

00:09:03.434 --> 00:09:06.924
or other things?
Well, it's just an accident of

00:09:06.924 --> 00:09:10.611
history.
So, what these people are

00:09:10.611 --> 00:09:17.434
proposing is that we merge
various agencies so that--define

00:09:17.434 --> 00:09:24.141
new agencies of the government
that are separated by these

00:09:24.141 --> 00:09:29.803
different objectives;
so, an objective defines an

00:09:29.803 --> 00:09:32.600
agency--a regulatory agency.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:45.770
What they want to do is merge
the OCC and the OTS merger;

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:49.788
that's one of the proposals.
I wonder why they don't carry

00:09:49.788 --> 00:09:52.440
it further, but that's the thing
they emphasized.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.055
The OCC is Office of the
Comptroller of the

00:09:56.055 --> 00:09:59.240
Currency--regulates national
banks.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.390
The OTS is the Office of Thrift
Supervision;

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.908
it regulates savings banks.
So, we put the two

00:10:06.908 --> 00:10:09.410
together--that sounds sensible,
I guess.

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:13.306
Why are they separate?
Various other things that they

00:10:13.306 --> 00:10:17.959
talked about had that form.
They want to merge the

00:10:17.959 --> 00:10:22.826
Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Commodity

00:10:22.826 --> 00:10:27.750
Futures Trading Commission.
The Securities and Exchange

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.641
Commission is the principal
government regulator for

00:10:31.641 --> 00:10:34.094
securities.
They make sure that everything

00:10:34.094 --> 00:10:35.710
is on the level and working
right.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:39.407
They help prevent fraud,
misrepresentation,

00:10:39.407 --> 00:10:43.809
manipulation of information in
stocks and bonds.

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:49.261
The CFTC is the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission and

00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:52.730
it regulates our futures
markets.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.186
There has been,
over the years,

00:10:55.186 --> 00:10:59.854
a lot of turf battles between
the SEC and the CFTC because

00:10:59.854 --> 00:11:04.603
it's sometimes unclear whether
something is a security or a

00:11:04.603 --> 00:11:06.547
futures.
For example,

00:11:06.547 --> 00:11:09.536
when they started trading stock
index futures,

00:11:09.536 --> 00:11:13.390
both these agencies thought it
was in their turf because it

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.379
involved both stock indexes and
futures.

00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:21.029
Anyway, Paulson is proposing
merging these.

00:11:21.029 --> 00:11:25.893
That makes sense and it seems
like getting rid of some of this

00:11:25.893 --> 00:11:30.120
division of regulatory agencies
is very beneficial.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:35.555
The division is what hampered
regulators from dealing with the

00:11:35.555 --> 00:11:39.819
financial subprime crisis.
People knew that a lot of bad

00:11:39.819 --> 00:11:43.420
loans were being made or loans
were being made to people who

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:47.216
shouldn't be getting them.
Low-income people were being

00:11:47.216 --> 00:11:51.485
given adjustable rate mortgages
with very low starter rates,

00:11:51.485 --> 00:11:55.899
called "teaser rates," that
would be raised in the future.

00:11:55.899 --> 00:11:59.958
They were given them with--in
such a way that after the rates

00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:03.340
were raised, they likely
couldn't afford to pay the

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.398
mortgage anymore or they'd be
under great stress in trying to

00:12:07.398 --> 00:12:09.789
do so.
So, a family that bought a

00:12:09.789 --> 00:12:13.493
house--a low-income family buys
a house they can barely afford

00:12:13.493 --> 00:12:15.679
it, then the rates go up on
them.

00:12:15.679 --> 00:12:18.956
The parents would have to take
out second jobs to try

00:12:18.956 --> 00:12:22.610
to--they're just going to go
bankrupt when that happens.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:27.673
It was, in some cases,
unethical and it was plainly a

00:12:27.673 --> 00:12:32.542
problem and yet the regulatory
agencies in the U.S.

00:12:32.542 --> 00:12:36.517
weren't stopping it.
Another reason why the

00:12:36.517 --> 00:12:40.537
regulatory agencies weren't
stopping these problems was

00:12:40.537 --> 00:12:44.929
because they often saw their
mission in different terms.

00:12:44.929 --> 00:12:49.975
When I gave a talk at the OCC
in 2005, I was asking them

00:12:49.975 --> 00:12:54.470
about, why aren't you policing
these mortgages?

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:58.451
Their first answer was,
well you have to remember we

00:12:58.451 --> 00:13:02.667
were set up in Abe Lincoln's day
to manage the national

00:13:02.667 --> 00:13:06.950
banks--that's our mission.
I may be overstating their

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:10.009
answer, but I got that flavor
from them.

00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:12.441
You want us to go out and
protect consumers,

00:13:12.441 --> 00:13:15.551
well of course that's a nice
mission, but that's not our

00:13:15.551 --> 00:13:16.230
mandate.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:26.076
I think that what Paulson and
Nason want to do is to create a

00:13:26.076 --> 00:13:31.430
separate business conduct agency
that is aimed at consumer

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.538
protection.
So, it would be working

00:13:34.538 --> 00:13:38.747
parallel with these other
agencies to--but their job would

00:13:38.747 --> 00:13:43.399
be to represent the consumer and
that sounds like a good idea to

00:13:43.399 --> 00:13:46.431
me.
The thing I stressed in my

00:13:46.431 --> 00:13:52.159
column was the market stability
regulator, which is the Fed.

00:13:52.159 --> 00:13:55.268
What they want to do is expand
the actions of the Fed,

00:13:55.268 --> 00:13:58.728
so that they're not--you can
describe the Federal Reserve or

00:13:58.728 --> 00:14:00.972
any central bank,
traditionally,

00:14:00.972 --> 00:14:04.259
as a banker's bank.
Remember, I told you the story

00:14:04.259 --> 00:14:07.816
of how the first--the Bank of
England was the first central

00:14:07.816 --> 00:14:11.679
bank and it made banks keep
deposits at the Bank of England.

00:14:11.679 --> 00:14:14.396
In other words,
the banks were like customers

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:17.981
of the Bank of England;
they had to keep deposits there

00:14:17.981 --> 00:14:22.131
and the Bank of England watched
them to make sure that they were

00:14:22.131 --> 00:14:25.951
behaving responsibly and had
authority over them because it

00:14:25.951 --> 00:14:30.630
had market power.
Well, the Fed is like that now,

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:36.258
but what Paulson and Nason
wanted to do is make it more

00:14:36.258 --> 00:14:40.077
than a banker's bank.
They want it to be a bank for

00:14:40.077 --> 00:14:43.379
the whole financial system.
That's what's already happening.

00:14:43.379 --> 00:14:47.860
In fact, it's just happening
rapidly as we speak.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.720
I mean, in this last month,
things have changed.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:55.058
The Fed has never given loans
to anyone other then a

00:14:55.058 --> 00:14:59.652
depository institution that is a
bank until last month,

00:14:59.652 --> 00:15:03.139
except they did so in the
Depression.

00:15:03.139 --> 00:15:04.960
There was this long gap in the
1930s;

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:09.213
the Fed was making loans to
private companies that were not

00:15:09.213 --> 00:15:13.539
banks and then they stopped
doing that, until last month.

00:15:13.539 --> 00:15:16.920
They created the--I mentioned
it last time,

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:21.670
the Term Securities Lending
Facility and the Primary Dealers

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.368
Credit Facility,
which are lending outside the

00:15:25.368 --> 00:15:29.603
banking system.
What Paulson wants to do is

00:15:29.603 --> 00:15:36.226
make that official that the Fed
is no longer just a central

00:15:36.226 --> 00:15:38.506
bank;
it's a market stability

00:15:38.506 --> 00:15:40.551
regulator.
This is going to be very

00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:43.044
controversial,
but I think it's a good thing

00:15:43.044 --> 00:15:45.176
to raise.
In my opinion,

00:15:45.176 --> 00:15:51.230
this is the trend anyway and I
think we're going that way.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:55.596
The problem is that in a modern
financial economy,

00:15:55.596 --> 00:16:01.875
we have so much instability,
which is already built into the

00:16:01.875 --> 00:16:08.271
system, that we rely on
something like a central bank to

00:16:08.271 --> 00:16:13.040
do things that help stabilize
markets.

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:26.138
I think that we're probably
going that way anyway and I

00:16:26.138 --> 00:16:29.386
think that in the next
presidential administration

00:16:29.386 --> 00:16:32.700
we'll see an expansion of the
role of the Fed.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.403
I wish the Fed had behaved
better in the recent crisis in

00:16:36.403 --> 00:16:40.306
the sense--they didn't seem to
recognize the bubbles that we

00:16:40.306 --> 00:16:44.076
had in the stock market in the
'90s and the housing in the

00:16:44.076 --> 00:16:45.982
2000s.
If they are our market

00:16:45.982 --> 00:16:48.561
stability regulator,
you'd hope that they could do a

00:16:48.561 --> 00:16:52.412
better job.
But, they're what we have and I

00:16:52.412 --> 00:16:58.291
think that we should probably
give them the authority to do

00:16:58.291 --> 00:17:03.360
that job and I think that's what
we need to do.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:08.390
I was generally positive about
their Treasury proposal.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:12.133
Another thing that they want to
do, which has been talked about

00:17:12.133 --> 00:17:13.940
for some time.
Yes?

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:26.666
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Robert

00:17:26.666 --> 00:17:34.277
Shiller: Yeah.
He asked, why do the news media

00:17:34.277 --> 00:17:36.890
think that the crisis is already
over?

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:41.277
Secondly, why do they think we
can prevent--that's

00:17:41.277 --> 00:17:45.225
paraphrasing.
I don't know if the news media

00:17:45.225 --> 00:17:49.307
are concluding anything,
but you do see--we have

00:17:49.307 --> 00:17:54.660
seen---over recent years,
we've seen a lot of suggestions

00:17:54.660 --> 00:18:00.311
that the turning point is just
around the corner and the news

00:18:00.311 --> 00:18:04.266
media report that.
I think there's a bias towards

00:18:04.266 --> 00:18:07.626
optimism among business
economists or among business

00:18:07.626 --> 00:18:10.868
people in general.
It's not considered good form

00:18:10.868 --> 00:18:14.779
to say, I think we're about to
have a crisis of confidence and

00:18:14.779 --> 00:18:17.920
the whole house of cards is
going to collapse.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.118
It's also not--it's generally
not in a business person's

00:18:22.118 --> 00:18:25.549
interest to suggest that,
so we're all instinctively

00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:28.500
trying to promote each other's
confidence and that's what

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.911
business people do.
They carry it a little further

00:18:30.911 --> 00:18:35.328
than that.
I was asked to be on Kudlow and

00:18:35.328 --> 00:18:42.606
Cramer--Kudlow and Company
show--I guess it was two nights

00:18:42.606 --> 00:18:45.207
ago.
I turned them down,

00:18:45.207 --> 00:18:50.239
but they wanted to put me on
opposite the CEO of Coldwell

00:18:50.239 --> 00:18:55.990
Banker, who is claiming that the
crisis is just about to end.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:19:00.397
I did a little research,
thinking I still might go on

00:19:00.397 --> 00:19:04.044
the show.
I looked up CEO of Coldwell

00:19:04.044 --> 00:19:10.177
Banker, but I found that there
was another CEO--this is a real

00:19:10.177 --> 00:19:14.315
estate broker's firm.
There was another CEO a year

00:19:14.315 --> 00:19:17.519
ago who was on TV--just exactly
a year ago--saying,

00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:21.595
I think this is the best time
ever--the best time in at least

00:19:21.595 --> 00:19:27.509
ten years to buy a house.
He said, the inventory is high;

00:19:27.509 --> 00:19:32.609
the market is bottoming out and
so on.

00:19:32.609 --> 00:19:36.385
He was spectacularly wrong,
but I notice he's also no

00:19:36.385 --> 00:19:39.790
longer CEO;
so, these things happen.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:43.305
There is a general bias.
On the other hand,

00:19:43.305 --> 00:19:47.322
I have to respect these people
that usually financial crises

00:19:47.322 --> 00:19:50.246
end okay.
There are repeated scares and

00:19:50.246 --> 00:19:54.220
usually it's all right.
We had a big scare in 1998;

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.971
it started with the Asian
financial crisis and then it

00:19:57.971 --> 00:20:02.360
spread to Russia and there was
this terrible collapse in Russia

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.844
in 1998,
when the government couldn't

00:20:04.844 --> 00:20:07.250
pay its debts.
Then that spread to the U.S.

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:09.456
and people were very fearful,
but the Fed,

00:20:09.456 --> 00:20:12.148
under Alan Greenspan,
was very quick to respond and

00:20:12.148 --> 00:20:15.269
the whole thing didn't turn out
to be anything so bad.

00:20:15.269 --> 00:20:18.410
The Fed again did like what
it's doing now;

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:23.140
it rescued this company called
Long Term Capital Management.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:28.113
Your question about whether we
can prevent this kind of thing

00:20:28.113 --> 00:20:33.335
in the future is a deep question
and I think that the problem is

00:20:33.335 --> 00:20:38.640
that our financial markets are
inherently somewhat unstable.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.798
When we start thinking up
really important new ways of

00:20:42.798 --> 00:20:47.819
doing financial business they
start to grow and they get huge.

00:20:47.819 --> 00:20:50.434
They get bigger and bigger
before you know it and it's just

00:20:50.434 --> 00:20:53.274
amazing how things can suddenly
grow and then nobody understands

00:20:53.274 --> 00:20:55.960
them;
so there's a vulnerability.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.210
I was just--got the latest
number--do you know how much

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.920
credit default swaps there are
outstanding?

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.606
According to the Bank for
International Settlements,

00:21:05.606 --> 00:21:09.581
there are now fifty-two
trillion dollars worth of credit

00:21:09.581 --> 00:21:14.494
default swaps outstanding;
fifty-two trillion dollars with

00:21:14.494 --> 00:21:19.009
the GDP of the United States is
fourteen trillion.

00:21:19.009 --> 00:21:21.926
How can there be fifty-two
trillion dollars of--these

00:21:21.926 --> 00:21:24.730
things only came in in the last
ten years or so.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:27.856
I called an economist at the
BIS and said,

00:21:27.856 --> 00:21:30.450
can you please explain it to
me?

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.140
Where is this fifty-two
trillion coming from?

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:37.399
I got a note from him and I'm
still trying to figure it all

00:21:37.399 --> 00:21:39.150
out.
That's what happens;

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:45.740
the system performs very well
and then it becomes vulnerable.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.550
Nobody understands all of it,
so that's the problem.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.100
The other side of it,
though, is there was a recent

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.196
study that looked at financial
crises and compared countries

00:22:00.196 --> 00:22:04.569
that have had financial crises
with countries that haven't.

00:22:04.569 --> 00:22:08.407
The conclusion was that
countries that have experienced

00:22:08.407 --> 00:22:11.890
financial crises are generally
more successful,

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:16.079
on average, over the long haul,
than countries that haven't.

00:22:16.079 --> 00:22:19.899
In that sense,
a financial crisis is a sign

00:22:19.899 --> 00:22:25.720
just that you're moving with the
times and you're making a lot of

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.471
money.
Then things suddenly blow up on

00:22:28.471 --> 00:22:31.918
you, but you'll recover and
you'll figure something out and

00:22:31.918 --> 00:22:36.502
then you'll move from there.
I don't know that Paulson's

00:22:36.502 --> 00:22:42.394
proposal--I kind of like them,
but I think that they're not

00:22:42.394 --> 00:22:44.364
enough;
that's why I'm writing a book

00:22:44.364 --> 00:22:46.416
about this.
I think there's a lot more to

00:22:46.416 --> 00:22:48.830
be done.
Even if you did everything that

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:52.446
I would do, we would still have
a vulnerability to financial

00:22:52.446 --> 00:22:55.123
crises.
Part of the reason why I'm

00:22:55.123 --> 00:22:59.964
endorsing this market stability
regulator is that I think that

00:22:59.964 --> 00:23:04.964
there's no way that we can just
guarantee--there's no way we can

00:23:04.964 --> 00:23:09.409
set up a system that is both
very effective in allocating

00:23:09.409 --> 00:23:13.059
resources and that is also very
stable.

00:23:13.059 --> 00:23:17.119
Just like when we went to the
moon--when we sent people up

00:23:17.119 --> 00:23:20.680
into space--one of those space
shuttles blew up.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.998
Well, that's what happens,
but most of them made it all

00:23:23.998 --> 00:23:28.147
right.
So, that's the way it is in

00:23:28.147 --> 00:23:32.463
finance as well.
Anyway, I'm here to talk today

00:23:32.463 --> 00:23:35.952
about investment banking,
which of course is relevant

00:23:35.952 --> 00:23:39.039
to--this is all part of this
general thing.

00:23:39.039 --> 00:23:45.499
Let me--I said earlier that
investment banking seems to be a

00:23:45.499 --> 00:23:49.549
great interest of students at
Yale;

00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:54.640
that's because they get some
really great jobs there.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:58.912
It's a--investment banking is a
very important economic

00:23:58.912 --> 00:24:02.711
institution and it's
fundamental--what they do is

00:24:02.711 --> 00:24:06.430
fundamental to what happens in
our economy.

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:12.622
So, as a result,
people who work for them have a

00:24:12.622 --> 00:24:17.630
chance for a great economic
success.

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:22.269
I'm not saying you want a job
at an investment bank because

00:24:22.269 --> 00:24:25.150
it's also demanding and
difficult.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:29.550
I've talked to some of our
students who have taken jobs at

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:34.029
investment banks and sometimes I
think they're probably too

00:24:34.029 --> 00:24:36.270
demanding.
As a young person,

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:40.076
you should be enjoying your
youth and not getting dragged in

00:24:40.076 --> 00:24:44.127
to some huge investment bank.
There are some terrible

00:24:44.127 --> 00:24:48.880
stories--young people who
took--who left college five,

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.961
ten years ago and they got a
job at Bear Stearns and Bear

00:24:52.961 --> 00:24:56.460
Stearns demand--I'm just making
this story up,

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.861
but it must be something like
this for somebody--demanded

00:24:59.861 --> 00:25:03.079
eighty-hour, hundred-hour week
devotion to the job,

00:25:03.079 --> 00:25:05.819
but they kept paying in Bear
Stearns stock.

00:25:05.819 --> 00:25:10.789
The student was making millions
every year.

00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:16.847
Meanwhile, his youth was going
away and now this imaginary

00:25:16.847 --> 00:25:22.692
student is now thirty-three
years old, never had time to

00:25:22.692 --> 00:25:27.736
marry or start a normal life.
Then, the whole thing blows up

00:25:27.736 --> 00:25:30.809
and all the Bear Stearns stock
is worth just about nothing;

00:25:30.809 --> 00:25:34.400
so, that's the kind of mistake
you don't want to make.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.910
I find the industry very
interesting.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:41.499
You have to form some kind of
balance in your life and not let

00:25:41.499 --> 00:25:44.559
anyone demand a hundred hours a
week of your time.

00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:48.935
If they do, you should sell the
stock they give as soon as you

00:25:48.935 --> 00:25:53.681
can and diversify.
I also like investment banking

00:25:53.681 --> 00:25:58.187
because I created one.
We have--my colleagues and I

00:25:58.187 --> 00:26:02.263
founded an investment bank
called Macro Markets and I'm not

00:26:02.263 --> 00:26:05.881
actually running it,
I'm co-found--it's named after

00:26:05.881 --> 00:26:08.349
a book I wrote called Marco
Markets.

00:26:08.349 --> 00:26:11.681
We're not a very big,
important bank yet,

00:26:11.681 --> 00:26:15.680
but it makes me interested in
the whole field.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.406
We have only hired one Yale
student so far,

00:26:20.406 --> 00:26:27.270
we're too tiny to--so we're not
hiring, in case you wonder.

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:33.763
It was a student in this class
that we hired,

00:26:33.763 --> 00:26:35.300
but again, that's all history.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.554
Anyway, what is investment
banking, which is the subject of

00:26:43.554 --> 00:26:47.244
this?
Investment banking means the

00:26:47.244 --> 00:26:50.470
underwriting of securities.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:00.814
That is, arranging for the
issuance by corporations of

00:27:00.814 --> 00:27:05.885
stocks and bonds.
The term bank is misleading

00:27:05.885 --> 00:27:14.162
because we often use it.
A depository institution is an

00:27:14.162 --> 00:27:22.887
institution that accepts
deposits and makes loans or

00:27:22.887 --> 00:27:29.559
invests the money from the
deposits.

00:27:29.559 --> 00:27:31.210
Do you know what I mean by a
deposit?

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:33.819
If you go to a savings bank,
or a savings and loan,

00:27:33.819 --> 00:27:36.534
or a commercial bank and you
say, I want to open up a

00:27:36.534 --> 00:27:38.569
checking account--that's a
deposit;

00:27:38.569 --> 00:27:42.009
or, I want to open up a saving
account--that's a deposit.

00:27:42.009 --> 00:27:46.764
The thing about a deposit is
you deposit your money as an

00:27:46.764 --> 00:27:51.094
individual and there are
millions of people that all

00:27:51.094 --> 00:27:54.490
deposit in a depository
institution.

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:56.894
Then, later on,
whenever you want,

00:27:56.894 --> 00:28:00.528
you can take your money out.
Meanwhile, they invest the

00:28:00.528 --> 00:28:04.038
deposits some way or another at
a higher interest rate than they

00:28:04.038 --> 00:28:07.269
pay on the deposits and they
make the difference and that's

00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:11.476
how they make a profit.
I often use the word bank to

00:28:11.476 --> 00:28:16.960
refer--and so does everyone--to
a depository institution.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.237
If you look at what the law
says, they tend to use the word

00:28:20.237 --> 00:28:23.106
depository institution.
An investment bank,

00:28:23.106 --> 00:28:27.397
if it's doing a pure investment
banking business is not a

00:28:27.397 --> 00:28:30.940
depository institution.
If you go into an investment

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.209
bank and say,
I want to open up a deposit,

00:28:33.209 --> 00:28:36.160
they'll say,
you should go next door to the

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.339
credit union or something--we
don't do that.

00:28:39.339 --> 00:28:42.750
So, the word bank is somewhat
misleading.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:47.279
On the other hand,
historically,

00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:53.390
most institutions do both.
If you go around the world,

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:57.729
most banks--most depository
institutions--are also involved

00:28:57.729 --> 00:29:01.318
in investment banking.
Let me just write over

00:29:01.318 --> 00:29:05.850
here--investment banking does
underwriting of securities.

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:12.987
What does that mean?
That means they arrange for the

00:29:12.987 --> 00:29:19.660
issuance by other institutions
of securities.

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.706
For example,
if Ford Motor Company wants to

00:29:22.706 --> 00:29:26.839
issue corporate bonds or they
want to issue new shares,

00:29:26.839 --> 00:29:30.746
they would go to an investment
bank and the investment bank

00:29:30.746 --> 00:29:33.710
would say, okay we can
underwrite for you,

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:38.218
but we'll do it for you.
A pure investment bank is not a

00:29:38.218 --> 00:29:43.974
depository institution and it's
also--a pure investment bank is

00:29:43.974 --> 00:29:47.942
not a broker-dealer either.
They're not trading in

00:29:47.942 --> 00:29:51.275
securities, although they would
deal in securities as a part of

00:29:51.275 --> 00:29:54.786
the underwriting process.
But, they're not--you wouldn't

00:29:54.786 --> 00:29:57.663
go to a pure investment bank
either and say,

00:29:57.663 --> 00:30:01.410
I want to buy a hundred shares
of Ford Motor Company,

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:04.493
where is your stockbroker?
They wouldn't be dealing with

00:30:04.493 --> 00:30:07.361
that.
They wouldn't--they deal--their

00:30:07.361 --> 00:30:12.190
customers are companies and they
wouldn't do that either.

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:16.909
But in many cases firms do a
mixture of different activities,

00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:19.819
one of which is investment
banking.

00:30:19.819 --> 00:30:27.227
There's a peculiar story that
refers particularly to

00:30:27.227 --> 00:30:36.087
America--the United States--and
that is the Glass-Steagall Act

00:30:36.087 --> 00:30:38.514
of 1933.
Again, you see,

00:30:38.514 --> 00:30:40.019
everything happened in the
'30s.

00:30:40.019 --> 00:30:45.292
The stock market crash in 1929
caused tremendous chaos in the

00:30:45.292 --> 00:30:50.383
financial markets.
Carter Glass was a Senator from

00:30:50.383 --> 00:30:54.576
Virginia and he and,
I think it's Henry,

00:30:54.576 --> 00:31:00.704
Steagall put together a bill
which passed Congress and was

00:31:00.704 --> 00:31:07.263
signed by President Roosevelt
that said that we want to make a

00:31:07.263 --> 00:31:13.176
law saying that investment banks
cannot be combined with

00:31:13.176 --> 00:31:19.650
commercial banks or insurance.
Investment banking had to be a

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:23.880
separate firm.
This is what they said in 1933.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:28.559
You could not be both a
depository institution and an

00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:31.436
investment bank.
So, they said,

00:31:31.436 --> 00:31:36.640
after this Act every bank has
to choose one or the other.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.029
Do you want to be an investment
bank or a commercial bank?

00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:42.652
For example,
then JP Morgan in the United

00:31:42.652 --> 00:31:47.904
States was founded by a man
named James Pierpont Morgan and

00:31:47.904 --> 00:31:52.160
it was one of the biggest banks
in the U.S.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.750
In 1933, it was told,
you got to make a choice;

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:59.690
are you an investment bank or a
commercial bank?

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:05.749
JP Morgan made a choice and
said, well we'll go to be a

00:32:05.749 --> 00:32:09.901
commercial bank,
so they stopped their

00:32:09.901 --> 00:32:14.390
investment banking business in
1933.

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:18.775
They've since gotten back into
it, but that's--but for a long

00:32:18.775 --> 00:32:21.480
time they became a commercial
bank.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:26.358
What happened?
They had a lot of people at JP

00:32:26.358 --> 00:32:33.473
Morgan who were doing investment
banking and they were upset

00:32:33.473 --> 00:32:38.779
because JP Morgan was shutting
them down.

00:32:38.779 --> 00:32:42.151
There was a Mr.
Stanley--I forget his first

00:32:42.151 --> 00:32:47.450
name now--who was--I mention him
because he was a Yale graduate.

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:52.358
He got the guys together from
JP Morgan who did investment

00:32:52.358 --> 00:32:55.890
banking and JP Morgan was dead
already,

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:59.013
but his son,
the young Morgan,

00:32:59.013 --> 00:33:05.328
and he created Morgan Stanley.
I have the suspicion that Mr.

00:33:05.328 --> 00:33:10.868
Stanley put the son of JP
Morgan on just for the prestige

00:33:10.868 --> 00:33:16.309
of the name--it sounds a lot
better, Morgan Stanley.

00:33:16.309 --> 00:33:23.180
This became an investment bank
and now JP Morgan and Morgan

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:30.049
Stanley, over seventy-five years
later, are competitors.

00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:37.630
That is the important history
of Glass-Steagall.

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:42.322
The problem is that,
as the years went on,

00:33:42.322 --> 00:33:45.287
in the U.S.
we had a division between

00:33:45.287 --> 00:33:47.711
investment banking and
commercial banking,

00:33:47.711 --> 00:33:50.490
but in Europe and other places
in the world,

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:53.829
banks were under no such
restriction.

00:33:53.829 --> 00:33:56.803
So, there was a lot of
complaints that our laws in the

00:33:56.803 --> 00:34:01.402
U.S.
were handicapping the U.S.

00:34:01.402 --> 00:34:07.503
banks.
Finally, Glass-Steagall was

00:34:07.503 --> 00:34:15.210
repealed and it didn't happen
until 1999;

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:27.658
so we have the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999,

00:34:27.658 --> 00:34:39.253
which repealed Glass-Steagall.
That led then to a whole wave

00:34:39.253 --> 00:34:44.493
of mergers of investment banks.
JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley

00:34:44.493 --> 00:34:48.130
could presumably have merged but
they didn't;

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:53.804
they've become too much of
competitors and they just

00:34:53.804 --> 00:35:00.368
developed their own--they just
internally adopted more broad

00:35:00.368 --> 00:35:07.170
definition of their business.
There are lots of mergers that

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:13.222
we can talk about that came
either--sometimes they occurred

00:35:13.222 --> 00:35:15.310
just before 1999.

00:35:28.949 --> 00:35:32.305
For example,
Travelers--The new

00:35:32.305 --> 00:35:38.680
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also
allowed insurance companies to

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:47.019
merge with commercial banks.
So, Traveler's Insurance and

00:35:47.019 --> 00:35:52.669
Citigroup merged in 1998.
I know that's before the bill,

00:35:52.669 --> 00:35:54.760
but that was as the bill was
just about to happen.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:36:10.329
Then JP Morgan and Chase merged
in 2000;

00:36:10.329 --> 00:36:26.050
and then UBS and Paine Webber
merged in 2000;

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:31.314
and Credit Suisse,
a Swiss bank,

00:36:31.314 --> 00:36:35.899
and Donaldson,
Lufkin, &amp;

00:36:35.899 --> 00:36:45.918
Jenrette--Donaldson was the
Dean of our business school here

00:36:45.918 --> 00:36:53.220
at SOM--that merger occurred in
2000.

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:01.680
Those are some examples.
So, now we're seeing a movement

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.754
back toward--so that a bank has
an investment banking business

00:37:05.754 --> 00:37:09.160
within it, but it's not just an
investment bank.

00:37:16.159 --> 00:37:18.130
It's sometimes hard to define
what something is.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:22.976
There's been a lot of news just
in the last year or even more

00:37:22.976 --> 00:37:28.145
recently, like yesterday or this
morning's paper about investment

00:37:28.145 --> 00:37:32.668
banks because under the current
financial crisis they are

00:37:32.668 --> 00:37:36.834
buckling;
a lot of them are in trouble

00:37:36.834 --> 00:37:42.770
and that's why it's big news.
I'll give you some examples.

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:46.200
I mentioned Bear Stearns;

00:37:52.309 --> 00:38:05.641
Bear Stearns was founded in
1923 by Joseph Bear and Robert

00:38:05.641 --> 00:38:09.664
Stearns.
I tried to find something out

00:38:09.664 --> 00:38:12.800
about them and they don't seem
to be very well-known.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:16.610
They're not on the Web--there's
no Bear Stearns--there's no

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:20.553
Joseph Bear admirer club on the
Web, but whatever they set up

00:38:20.553 --> 00:38:25.397
was really big for a while.
From 1923 to 2008,

00:38:25.397 --> 00:38:33.663
when it went bust--so it lasted
eighty-five years--so,

00:38:33.663 --> 00:38:39.590
it has investment banking
business,

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:43.960
but it also has private equity
business and private banking.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:49.678
It started to get in trouble
during the current--in fact,

00:38:49.678 --> 00:38:55.784
it was maybe the first U.S.
investment bank to get in

00:38:55.784 --> 00:39:03.457
trouble in the current financial
crisis because it was in June

00:39:03.457 --> 00:39:09.369
2007--they had some of their
funds collapse.

00:39:09.369 --> 00:39:14.061
They had funds that were
investing in subprime mortgages

00:39:14.061 --> 00:39:17.900
and this is a sign there's
something wrong.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:22.138
The names of these funds were
the Bear Stearns High-Grade

00:39:22.138 --> 00:39:25.769
Structured Credit Fund.
Notice they say "high-grade."

00:39:25.769 --> 00:39:28.010
You know what high-grade is
supposed to mean in finance?

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:30.269
That it's not going to fail on
you.

00:39:30.269 --> 00:39:35.747
They had another one called the
Bear Stearns High-Grade

00:39:35.747 --> 00:39:40.210
Structured Credit Enhanced
Leveraged Fund.

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:42.760
Now, that sounds a little bit
like a contradiction.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.455
You should, as a consumer of
financial products,

00:39:45.455 --> 00:39:48.667
wonder when they put both
high-grade and leveraged in the

00:39:48.667 --> 00:39:51.358
same name.
High-grade is supposed to mean

00:39:51.358 --> 00:39:54.128
safe, but leveraged sounds like
the opposite,

00:39:54.128 --> 00:39:56.719
doesn't it?
If you--leverage means that

00:39:56.719 --> 00:40:00.710
they borrowed a lot of money to
buy risky subprime securities.

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:04.643
So, if they borrowed 80% of the
money, the securities only have

00:40:04.643 --> 00:40:07.880
to lose 20% of the value for you
to be wiped out;

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.000
so that shouldn't be high-grade
if it's so leveraged.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.555
Anyway, these two funds were
wiped out and Bear Stearns had

00:40:17.555 --> 00:40:22.190
to give--deal out $3.2 billion
dollars;

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:26.268
that was last summer,
but the news kept getting worse

00:40:26.268 --> 00:40:30.094
and worse.
Apparently, Bear had invested a

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:35.399
lot in its securities that were
unstable and so it finally

00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:40.889
became where rumors started
developing that Bear was--it was

00:40:40.889 --> 00:40:45.989
really rumors that killed Bear.
The rumors started going that

00:40:45.989 --> 00:40:48.946
Bear is in trouble,
so you're going to be--they're

00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:51.300
going to be in bankrupt before
long.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.824
This is exactly the market
stability problem that Paulson

00:40:54.824 --> 00:40:57.861
is talking about.
Once the rumors get started,

00:40:57.861 --> 00:41:01.150
everybody is saying,
don't do anything with Bear;

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:05.130
don't lend them any money;
just stay away from them.

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:08.189
Even young people who are
getting jobs--and they were

00:41:08.189 --> 00:41:11.659
right to think this--don't even
take a job with them because

00:41:11.659 --> 00:41:14.659
you're going to be on the street
again shortly.

00:41:14.659 --> 00:41:18.389
It's that kind of rumor that
killed Bear Stearns.

00:41:18.389 --> 00:41:24.209
They couldn't pay their bills
and they were finding it

00:41:24.209 --> 00:41:29.918
difficult to sell their assets
to come up with money,

00:41:29.918 --> 00:41:34.310
so the Fed decided to bail them
out.

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:42.047
This was a huge Fed bailout.
Well, they didn't want--the Fed

00:41:42.047 --> 00:41:48.860
didn't want to bail out the
stockholders;

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.956
they didn't want to just give
money to people who had invested

00:41:50.956 --> 00:41:52.710
because firms are supposed to be
allowed to fail.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:58.114
So, what the Fed did is it gave
a line of credit to JP Morgan--a

00:41:58.114 --> 00:42:02.489
non-recourse line of credit--to
buy Bear Stearns.

00:42:02.489 --> 00:42:07.340
What it amounted to was that
the Fed would take troubled

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:11.309
securities that Bear Stearns
couldn't sell.

00:42:11.309 --> 00:42:14.912
It would take that as
collateral for a twenty-nine

00:42:14.912 --> 00:42:19.250
billion dollar loan to JP Morgan
under the condition that JP

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:23.974
Morgan would buy Bear Stearns.
It was supposed to be at two

00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:27.708
dollars a share,
so that left the total value of

00:42:27.708 --> 00:42:31.920
Bear Stearns at a little over
two hundred million,

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:35.451
which is pretty tiny compared
to what they were worth,

00:42:35.451 --> 00:42:39.050
which was in the tens of
billions a short while ago.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:43.769
The Fed didn't want a
disorderly collapse.

00:42:43.769 --> 00:42:50.756
So, it was a twenty-nine
billion dollar loan to JP

00:42:50.756 --> 00:42:55.099
Morgan;
this is highly controversial

00:42:55.099 --> 00:43:01.546
these days because the Fed isn't
normally doing this sort of

00:43:01.546 --> 00:43:04.410
thing.
Why would it be lending money

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:06.809
to JP Morgan to buy another
company?

00:43:06.809 --> 00:43:11.352
You say, how is that benefiting
the average person in this

00:43:11.352 --> 00:43:14.118
country?
It does benefit them because if

00:43:14.118 --> 00:43:17.292
they didn't do this,
Bear Stearns would have dumped

00:43:17.292 --> 00:43:21.460
its assets on the market.
It would go down in flames;

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:24.967
lots of its debts would
become--lots of people who had

00:43:24.967 --> 00:43:29.003
accounts with Bear Stearns would
find that their accounts were

00:43:29.003 --> 00:43:29.930
destroyed.

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:35.377
Then what would it do?
It might lead to contagion to

00:43:35.377 --> 00:43:37.601
other financial institutions.
People would say,

00:43:37.601 --> 00:43:39.550
well it happened to Bear--who's
next?

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:42.219
There would be this huge
pulling back.

00:43:42.219 --> 00:43:47.061
So, the Fed decided to bail
them out and that's what they

00:43:47.061 --> 00:43:49.441
did.
Now, it's not clear that it's

00:43:49.441 --> 00:43:52.010
over, if you read this morning's
paper.

00:43:52.010 --> 00:44:00.679
Lehman Brothers is another
investment bank that is rumored

00:44:00.679 --> 00:44:05.996
to be in trouble,
so it's got to do something

00:44:05.996 --> 00:44:11.570
about these rumors because it
can kill them--just the rumors.

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:13.590
No one will want to do anything
with them;

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:20.317
it was in this morning's paper
or yesterday's news that they

00:44:20.317 --> 00:44:25.789
have arranged to raise capital
on the markets.

00:44:25.789 --> 00:44:29.545
It was not entirely clear--that
means, they're getting people

00:44:29.545 --> 00:44:32.988
who are willing to invest give
them money--invest in the

00:44:32.988 --> 00:44:35.759
company.
It's a sign of confidence in

00:44:35.759 --> 00:44:39.942
Lehman Brothers that someone
would do that at this critical

00:44:39.942 --> 00:44:42.691
time.
Another story that came in

00:44:42.691 --> 00:44:45.532
yesterday--UBS,
I mentioned before,

00:44:45.532 --> 00:44:48.790
was a Swiss bank but it's not
Swiss;

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:52.557
it's international now.
It started out as the Union

00:44:52.557 --> 00:44:58.331
Bank of Switzerland--that's what
it stands for--Union Bank of

00:44:58.331 --> 00:45:03.719
Switzerland--which was the
result of a merger between two

00:45:03.719 --> 00:45:08.369
Swiss banks around 1900.
Then it, as I mentioned,

00:45:08.369 --> 00:45:12.707
merged with Paine Webber and
it's become an international

00:45:12.707 --> 00:45:16.126
corporation;
so they just call themselves

00:45:16.126 --> 00:45:19.583
UBS.
In this morning's newspaper,

00:45:19.583 --> 00:45:25.909
it said that UBS announced that
it has lost--what was it?

00:45:25.909 --> 00:45:28.309
Does someone remember what the
numbers were?

00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:29.784
Student:
[Inaudible]

00:45:29.784 --> 00:45:32.279
Professor Robert
Shiller: They've lost

00:45:32.279 --> 00:45:33.470
nineteen billion?

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:42.917
That's a huge loss--nineteen
billion dollars is a substantial

00:45:42.917 --> 00:45:47.653
part of their market cap,
but they are also announcing

00:45:47.653 --> 00:45:52.000
that they are arranging to raise
capital as well.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.003
The news that these firms,
which are rumored to be in

00:45:56.003 --> 00:46:00.777
trouble, are managing to raise
capital buoyed markets yesterday

00:46:00.777 --> 00:46:04.550
and we had a big upsurge in the
stock market.

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:08.119
It was, well,
yesterday was the first day of

00:46:08.119 --> 00:46:12.768
the second quarter and the
newspapers were reporting that

00:46:12.768 --> 00:46:17.832
it was the biggest upsurge on
the market on the first day of a

00:46:17.832 --> 00:46:21.907
new quarter since 1938.
I looked at that with some

00:46:21.907 --> 00:46:25.628
curiosity because 1938 was not
such a great year after all,

00:46:25.628 --> 00:46:29.973
it was still in the Depression.
I think the market didn't do

00:46:29.973 --> 00:46:33.835
great after that then,
so this doesn't predict much

00:46:33.835 --> 00:46:35.690
one way or the other.

00:46:41.639 --> 00:46:44.199
Anyway, this is where we are
now, it's an interesting

00:46:44.199 --> 00:46:47.399
situation.
If you are thinking of taking a

00:46:47.399 --> 00:46:52.364
job at one of these companies,
you might consider looking at

00:46:52.364 --> 00:46:57.667
their situation because some of
these companies could follow the

00:46:57.667 --> 00:47:00.949
way of Bear Stearns at this
point.

00:47:00.949 --> 00:47:04.198
We have the Fed aggressively
lending and trying to prevent

00:47:04.198 --> 00:47:06.706
another thing,
but you know the Fed is not in

00:47:06.706 --> 00:47:10.239
the business of making sure that
your career is a success.

00:47:10.239 --> 00:47:13.530
They're in the business of
preventing a systemic failure;

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:18.759
so, while the Fed arranged for
an orderly dissolution of Bear

00:47:18.759 --> 00:47:23.813
Stearns, it didn't do a whole
lot of good to Bear employees

00:47:23.813 --> 00:47:27.909
who--we'll see what happens to
all of them.

00:47:27.909 --> 00:47:32.189
I don't know the whole story,
but it's a tumultuous world out

00:47:32.189 --> 00:47:34.710
there;
it's not like you live in an

00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:39.027
academic environment where Yale
University has been in business

00:47:39.027 --> 00:47:42.510
for over 300 years and it looks
so stable here.

00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:44.519
Well, this is a very stable
business;

00:47:44.519 --> 00:47:47.150
these other businesses are not
so stable.

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:53.676
Anyway, I wanted to talk about
the underwriting process and

00:47:53.676 --> 00:47:57.963
what it's done.
I think underwriting of

00:47:57.963 --> 00:48:02.505
securities is--it's
analogous--the investment

00:48:02.505 --> 00:48:08.800
banking business is analogous to
the business done by ordinary

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:14.477
commercial banks in the sense
that it deals with a moral

00:48:14.477 --> 00:48:20.670
hazard problem and an asymmetric
information problem.

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:27.750
We were talking about what
banks do--commercial banks.

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:32.029
Remember, I was telling the
story that the big problem with

00:48:32.029 --> 00:48:36.309
lending to companies is that
it's hard to tell whether they

00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:39.039
are deserving of the loan or
not.

00:48:39.039 --> 00:48:42.817
So, a commercial banker is
someone who lives in a business

00:48:42.817 --> 00:48:46.860
community, and keeps abreast of
everything that's going on,

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:49.927
and plays golf with all the
local business people,

00:48:49.927 --> 00:48:53.308
and has a sense--hears the
gossip--has a sense of who's

00:48:53.308 --> 00:48:55.635
responsible,
who will pay back a loan,

00:48:55.635 --> 00:48:57.755
who's got a business that's
really going,

00:48:57.755 --> 00:49:00.670
who's got a business that's
sick and on the way out;

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:05.081
that's what a bank does.
Everyone else who wants to

00:49:05.081 --> 00:49:09.114
invest doesn't know this,
but they put their money in the

00:49:09.114 --> 00:49:13.270
bank and then that's the idea.
The moral hazard is the moral

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:16.586
hazard that the company,
which receives a loan from the

00:49:16.586 --> 00:49:18.920
bank, would take the money and
run.

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:22.591
The asymmetric information
problem is that you,

00:49:22.591 --> 00:49:26.902
as an investor--if you were to
make loans directly to a

00:49:26.902 --> 00:49:30.106
company,
you would be suffering at a

00:49:30.106 --> 00:49:34.599
disadvantage because you know
less than other people.

00:49:34.599 --> 00:49:40.102
You don't play golf with these
people and so you would end up

00:49:40.102 --> 00:49:44.780
taking on the worst loans--loans
that would fail.

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:48.053
The same thing applies to
underwriting because--but they

00:49:48.053 --> 00:49:52.928
do it in a different way.
Instead of certifying--instead

00:49:52.928 --> 00:49:59.574
of creating deposits at a bank,
they underwrite securities and

00:49:59.574 --> 00:50:04.696
they are not taking the money;
they're just an intermediary

00:50:04.696 --> 00:50:07.585
between you the public and the
issuer of the security,

00:50:07.585 --> 00:50:14.815
but it's much the same thing.
It's the reputation of the bank

00:50:14.815 --> 00:50:24.369
that makes it possible for firms
to issue securities.

00:50:24.369 --> 00:50:30.853
The underwriting process is
very important to understand

00:50:30.853 --> 00:50:37.690
because it's a process that
allows issuers of securities to

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:44.409
take advantage of the reputation
of the underwriters.

00:50:44.409 --> 00:50:49.940
The issuer of the security may
not be so well-known or not so

00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:53.626
well-understood,
so the--what happens is,

00:50:53.626 --> 00:50:57.590
the underwriter--what's a good
analogy?

00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:00.136
I was going to say,
it's like a dating service,

00:51:00.136 --> 00:51:02.406
but I guess dating services
don't do this,

00:51:02.406 --> 00:51:06.119
right?
They don't testify to the moral

00:51:06.119 --> 00:51:08.730
character;
they should.

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:11.360
Do they do that?
Does anyone do that?

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:14.684
They probably can't, right?
That's an even bigger moral

00:51:14.684 --> 00:51:17.092
hazard problem.
When you're looking for a

00:51:17.092 --> 00:51:20.308
spouse, you have a huge moral
hazard problem and there's

00:51:20.308 --> 00:51:22.940
nobody there to help you as far
as I know.

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:25.850
At least in the business world
we have professionals;

00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:29.977
they're matchmakers in a sense.
They're trying to match up a

00:51:29.977 --> 00:51:33.734
company that's issuing
securities to buyers of the

00:51:33.734 --> 00:51:37.338
securities and this is an
important reason for a

00:51:37.338 --> 00:51:41.709
difference between investment
banking and other aspects of

00:51:41.709 --> 00:51:44.978
finance.
Investment bankers,

00:51:44.978 --> 00:51:51.223
compared particularly to
traders, investment bankers like

00:51:51.223 --> 00:51:57.133
to cultivate an image of sober
responsibility and good

00:51:57.133 --> 00:52:03.489
citizenship because they thrive
on their reputation.

00:52:03.489 --> 00:52:08.047
So they--to be successful as an
investment banker,

00:52:08.047 --> 00:52:13.255
you have to be so impressive
and such high character that

00:52:13.255 --> 00:52:19.114
companies like Ford and GM will
come to you to represent them in

00:52:19.114 --> 00:52:23.186
the sale of their securities.
As a result,

00:52:23.186 --> 00:52:26.179
investment bankers tend to be
well dressed;

00:52:26.179 --> 00:52:32.130
they tend to be patrician in
their appearances and manner.

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:37.008
In contrast,
traders tend to have vulgar

00:52:37.008 --> 00:52:39.970
accents;
they shout on the phone;

00:52:39.970 --> 00:52:42.739
they slam the phone down;
they roll up their sleeves;

00:52:42.739 --> 00:52:44.730
they dribble food on their
shirt.

00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:47.829
I may be putting them down too
much.

00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:52.072
I, personally,
think that we have a strength

00:52:52.072 --> 00:52:57.992
at Yale because of our patrician
image in providing people to

00:52:57.992 --> 00:53:02.995
work for this field.
Typically, investment bankers

00:53:02.995 --> 00:53:06.449
go to the symphony on Saturday
night.

00:53:06.449 --> 00:53:09.228
But beyond that,
if you open up the program at

00:53:09.228 --> 00:53:11.697
the symphony,
you'll see their name under

00:53:11.697 --> 00:53:15.940
platinum sponsor on the program.
That's the kind of people that

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:20.048
go into investment banking and
they do it because they have to

00:53:20.048 --> 00:53:22.809
manage this underwriting process
well.

00:53:22.809 --> 00:53:24.860
What is the underwriting
process?

00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:30.199
Well, what happens is a company
that is thinking of issue--let's

00:53:30.199 --> 00:53:34.267
say you're any company,
a big company--it doesn't

00:53:34.267 --> 00:53:36.391
matter.
People don't trust big

00:53:36.391 --> 00:53:39.369
companies even if they've been
around a hundred years.

00:53:39.369 --> 00:53:42.670
So, if Ford Motor Company--it's
been around since when?

00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:46.871
Something like around 1900.
But people sure don't trust it

00:53:46.871 --> 00:53:49.269
anymore because it's had a
history of trouble.

00:53:49.269 --> 00:53:51.449
It's not a question just of
morality or anything;

00:53:51.449 --> 00:53:53.878
it's a question of,
are you willing to buy their

00:53:53.878 --> 00:53:56.481
securities.
So, they would go to an

00:53:56.481 --> 00:54:00.010
investment banker and say,
we need money;

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:04.357
we'd like to raise it by,
say, issuing shares in our

00:54:04.357 --> 00:54:07.259
company.
Then they would probably

00:54:07.259 --> 00:54:12.469
contact a number of investment
banks and try to make a deal.

00:54:12.469 --> 00:54:15.969
Now, there are two kinds of
deals;

00:54:15.969 --> 00:54:21.600
there's a "bought deal" and a
"best efforts."

00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:29.812
The difference is,
some investment bankers will

00:54:29.812 --> 00:54:33.628
tell the company,
we will--you want to issue

00:54:33.628 --> 00:54:35.670
these shares,
fine;

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:38.040
sell them to us;
we'll take it;

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:40.715
we'll give you a price.
Of course, the investment bank

00:54:40.715 --> 00:54:44.147
doesn't want to hold these
shares, but the investment bank

00:54:44.147 --> 00:54:48.059
knows the public well enough to
know which shares it can sell.

00:54:48.059 --> 00:54:52.511
In a bought deal the investment
bank is taking the risk that

00:54:52.511 --> 00:54:57.190
they might not be able to sell
the shares at a decent price;

00:54:57.190 --> 00:55:01.588
they might lose on it.
Also, there's a different kind

00:55:01.588 --> 00:55:06.769
of offering, which may be the
best you could get;

00:55:06.769 --> 00:55:08.880
it's called a best efforts
offering.

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:13.006
Here, the investment banker
will not buy the deal,

00:55:13.006 --> 00:55:17.807
but it will say that we will
use our best efforts to place

00:55:17.807 --> 00:55:21.260
this and if you have a minimum
price,

00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:24.125
we hope we can get above that;
otherwise, the deal will fall

00:55:24.125 --> 00:55:27.808
through.
The underwriting process

00:55:27.808 --> 00:55:35.732
is--takes the form of--it's
actually very much regulated by

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:41.470
the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:47.767
So, the process is formalized.
In order to issue securities,

00:55:47.767 --> 00:55:53.967
you--we're talking about public
securities here--you have to

00:55:53.967 --> 00:55:59.183
register them with the SEC.
So, the SEC then becomes a

00:55:59.183 --> 00:56:03.309
partner or an adversary in your
effort to issue these

00:56:03.309 --> 00:56:06.462
securities.
The SEC, the Securities and

00:56:06.462 --> 00:56:10.698
Exchange Commission--all this
might be changed next year,

00:56:10.698 --> 00:56:14.480
who knows, but this is the way
it is right now.

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:20.739
The law says,
there's a pre-filing period;

00:56:20.739 --> 00:56:26.787
you have to file with the SEC
to get your securities

00:56:26.787 --> 00:56:29.971
effective.
The idea--say Ford Motor

00:56:29.971 --> 00:56:32.539
Company wants to issue new
shares.

00:56:32.539 --> 00:56:36.930
They go to the investment bank,
then the investment bank

00:56:36.930 --> 00:56:41.240
negotiates with the firm--with
Ford--about what kind of

00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:46.190
securities it wants to issue and
what price is reasonable.

00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:51.183
During this period,
the SEC says there's no talk to

00:56:51.183 --> 00:56:58.005
the public about the shares.
During this period,

00:56:58.005 --> 00:57:01.630
no talk publicly;

00:57:05.719 --> 00:57:09.196
the SEC wants to manage the
process so that everything is

00:57:09.196 --> 00:57:12.144
done appropriately.
At this point,

00:57:12.144 --> 00:57:18.723
during the pre-filing period,
the investment bank forms a

00:57:18.723 --> 00:57:26.125
syndicate of other underwriters
and they sign an agreement among

00:57:26.125 --> 00:57:30.872
underwriters.
Usually, one investment bank is

00:57:30.872 --> 00:57:35.967
not big enough to handle a big
issue and it wants to get help

00:57:35.967 --> 00:57:41.427
of other investment banks,
so they form a syndicate of

00:57:41.427 --> 00:57:46.199
underwriters during the
pre-filing period.

00:57:46.199 --> 00:57:51.186
There's a lead underwriter,
which Ford Motor Company

00:57:51.186 --> 00:57:55.195
approached first,
and the lead underwriter

00:57:55.195 --> 00:58:00.137
promised to take on the issue,
but the lead underwriter

00:58:00.137 --> 00:58:04.057
doesn't want to do it itself.
The reason it doesn't want to

00:58:04.057 --> 00:58:07.722
do it just itself is that in
order to sell and issue to a

00:58:07.722 --> 00:58:11.740
broad public,
you have to make use of a broad

00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:17.107
network of contacts with the
public and no one investment

00:58:17.107 --> 00:58:21.897
bank has them all.
So, they form a syndicate--a

00:58:21.897 --> 00:58:27.650
group of investment banks that
are all participating in the

00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:33.304
issue of the security--and then
they file and then there's

00:58:33.304 --> 00:58:37.470
what's called a "cooling off
period,"

00:58:41.969 --> 00:58:46.550
when the security is in
registration.

00:58:46.550 --> 00:58:49.429
They file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission a

00:58:49.429 --> 00:58:51.990
prospectus for this--a
preliminary prospectus.

00:59:00.719 --> 00:59:05.829
This goes to the Securities and
Exchange Commission for

00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:09.203
approval;
it's not really approval of the

00:59:09.203 --> 00:59:12.440
issue, but it's registration of
the issue.

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:19.510
The preliminary prospectus is
called the "red herring."

00:59:27.079 --> 00:59:32.070
The "red herring"--it's lost in
history why they call it that;

00:59:32.070 --> 00:59:33.809
there's different theories
about it.

00:59:33.809 --> 00:59:38.525
A herring, of course,
is a type of fish and the best

00:59:38.525 --> 00:59:43.980
explanation that I can get for
this name for the preliminary

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:48.973
prospectus is that it was
referring to an activity that

00:59:48.973 --> 00:59:53.610
hunters used to do with dogs.
I don't know if I should tell

00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:55.782
you these stories,
but I like to know why they

00:59:55.782 --> 00:59:58.866
call it a red herring.
If you have hunting dogs,

00:59:58.866 --> 01:00:03.519
they're supposed to track down
a fox by their sense of smell.

01:00:03.519 --> 01:00:09.076
So, one pace you can put your
dogs through is to try to

01:00:09.076 --> 01:00:12.807
confuse them.
They would take a red herring,

01:00:12.807 --> 01:00:17.035
which is a very smelly kind of
fish, and they would drag it

01:00:17.035 --> 01:00:19.659
around over the trail of the
fox;

01:00:19.659 --> 01:00:25.633
it's very difficult for dogs to
still smell the fox over that

01:00:25.633 --> 01:00:28.791
smell.
The word red herring became

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:33.690
known as a euphemism for
something trying to distract and

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:38.126
confuse and so it was a joke.
I think it was a joke on Wall

01:00:38.126 --> 01:00:41.287
Street that the prospectus is
really just there to try to

01:00:41.287 --> 01:00:44.110
confuse you, so they called it
the red herring.

01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:48.314
The preliminary prospectus is
now often printed with red

01:00:48.314 --> 01:00:52.824
borders on it to indicate that
it's the red herring and it's

01:00:52.824 --> 01:00:57.781
only preliminary.
Finally, the Fed evaluates the

01:00:57.781 --> 01:01:04.929
prospectus and makes sure that
it accords with all regulations.

01:01:04.929 --> 01:01:09.493
It puts it up on its website at
the SEC while it's in

01:01:09.493 --> 01:01:13.644
registration.
Again, during the "cooling off"

01:01:13.644 --> 01:01:18.489
period, firms are allowed to
circulate the preliminary

01:01:18.489 --> 01:01:22.007
prospectus.
Underwriters are allowed to

01:01:22.007 --> 01:01:26.151
circulate the preliminary
prospectus with potential

01:01:26.151 --> 01:01:29.265
buyers,
but they're not supposed to say

01:01:29.265 --> 01:01:33.320
anything besides what's in the
preliminary prospectus.

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.787
What they're concerned
about--the SEC is concerned

01:01:36.787 --> 01:01:40.680
about people overselling
securities and they might point

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.289
out advantages of it and not the
disadvantages.

01:01:44.289 --> 01:01:47.619
The idea of a pro--what's in a
prospectus?

01:01:47.619 --> 01:01:51.604
A prospectus is a document that
completely tells everything

01:01:51.604 --> 01:01:54.640
about a security.
The whole idea of the SEC is

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:58.349
that we're not letting anyone
pull the wool over your eyes;

01:01:58.349 --> 01:02:00.530
that's why it really shouldn't
be called a "red herring."

01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:02.030
It's not supposed to deceive
you;

01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:04.889
it's supposed to pour out
everything about the security.

01:02:04.889 --> 01:02:08.230
One thing that's in a
prospectus--a preliminary or

01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:12.389
final prospectus--is the company
thinks of everything bad that

01:02:12.389 --> 01:02:15.453
could ever happen.
If you read prospectuses,

01:02:15.453 --> 01:02:18.476
they'll say awful things.
If you read them carefully,

01:02:18.476 --> 01:02:21.476
they'll say this company could
lose everything--we could be

01:02:21.476 --> 01:02:23.389
sued;
we could be going to jail;

01:02:23.389 --> 01:02:26.787
we might have done all
sorts--maybe I'm exaggerating,

01:02:26.787 --> 01:02:30.708
but the lawyers put everything
imaginable that could go wrong

01:02:30.708 --> 01:02:34.085
with this investment in there.
They do it--of course,

01:02:34.085 --> 01:02:37.025
it's in kind of fine print,
but it's all in there so that

01:02:37.025 --> 01:02:39.642
it's disclosed.
So later, if someone loses

01:02:39.642 --> 01:02:42.536
money in the investment and
wants to sue them,

01:02:42.536 --> 01:02:44.980
then they'll say,
well look it's in our

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:48.080
prospectus.
The reason that the SEC doesn't

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.420
want them to talk about
securities at this point,

01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:55.571
except to give the prospectus,
is so that they can't conceal

01:02:55.571 --> 01:03:00.050
and hide these things.
This is the SEC process;

01:03:00.050 --> 01:03:03.896
the process says that the
underwriters have to give out

01:03:03.896 --> 01:03:07.030
the prospectus and that's all
they can do;

01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:09.349
they can't have a separate
brochure.

01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:13.393
They can't--your broker can't
say, well we're thinking of

01:03:13.393 --> 01:03:16.239
issuing a security;
we've got this prospectus,

01:03:16.239 --> 01:03:19.360
but I'm going to send you a
brochure instead--that's easier.

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:22.328
The SEC says,
no way, because that brochure

01:03:22.328 --> 01:03:26.639
will be a sales job and it won't
have all of this in there.

01:03:26.639 --> 01:03:32.356
Anyway, then eventually the SEC
approves it and when it's

01:03:32.356 --> 01:03:38.787
approved then it's effective and
then the underwriters can start

01:03:38.787 --> 01:03:42.629
selling the security.
At that point,

01:03:42.629 --> 01:03:47.050
they actually say it's a
best-efforts offering;

01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:51.950
then they go around and they
try to--they get buyers of the

01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:55.475
security lined up.
Now, you have to understand

01:03:55.475 --> 01:03:58.670
that there's a problem issuing a
new security.

01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:01.695
Securities that are already out
there and trading--everybody

01:04:01.695 --> 01:04:04.915
knows about them.
There's a market for them,

01:04:04.915 --> 01:04:09.839
but if you're issuing a new
security, especially if it's a

01:04:09.839 --> 01:04:15.195
company that is issuing shares
for the first time--an IPO is an

01:04:15.195 --> 01:04:20.258
initial public offering.
An IPO is the first time that a

01:04:20.258 --> 01:04:24.549
company issues shares,
so the company is not known to

01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:29.501
the public and it's very hard to
get IPOs started because the

01:04:29.501 --> 01:04:34.940
company is just not known.
It's very important that the

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:40.699
underwriters are able to get
attention and get the market

01:04:40.699 --> 01:04:45.645
going for the IPO.
During the "cooling off"

01:04:45.645 --> 01:04:52.725
period, firms also are allowed
to place, according to the SEC,

01:04:52.725 --> 01:05:01.376
something called a tombstone;
that is an ad in the newspaper,

01:05:01.376 --> 01:05:06.789
which will announce the
security.

01:05:06.789 --> 01:05:10.314
It's a very dignified ad
because it has to meet with the

01:05:10.314 --> 01:05:13.710
approval of the Securities and
Exchange Commission,

01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:20.614
but a tombstone will say,
Ford Motor Company--one million

01:05:20.614 --> 01:05:24.943
shares offered.
Then it will list all of the

01:05:24.943 --> 01:05:29.251
underwriting syndicate,
so it will be a list of all the

01:05:29.251 --> 01:05:33.320
investment banks that
participated in the issue.

01:05:41.489 --> 01:05:45.199
That's the basic process that
underwriters go through to issue

01:05:45.199 --> 01:05:49.459
securities.
Now, part of the thing is--I

01:05:49.459 --> 01:05:53.672
just want to close
with--basically,

01:05:53.672 --> 01:06:01.107
I think that investment banks
are very similar to impresarios

01:06:01.107 --> 01:06:07.165
in what they do.
What I mean by an impresario is

01:06:07.165 --> 01:06:13.184
someone who manages a singer or
a musician in concerts,

01:06:13.184 --> 01:06:19.136
but it's a little different.
An underwriter is managing the

01:06:19.136 --> 01:06:23.297
career of a security,
just like somebody else would

01:06:23.297 --> 01:06:26.460
be managing the career of a
singer;

01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:30.366
they're very concerned about
their reputation and they're

01:06:30.366 --> 01:06:34.342
very concerned about getting
sold out performances all the

01:06:34.342 --> 01:06:36.975
time.
Now, one thing about IPOs is

01:06:36.975 --> 01:06:41.488
that they are very hard--to get
a new security for a new company

01:06:41.488 --> 01:06:44.639
going--because nobody knows this
company.

01:06:44.639 --> 01:06:51.464
The price movements of an IPO
tend to be very volatile and

01:06:51.464 --> 01:06:58.050
it's because of the difficulty
in getting IPOs going;

01:06:58.050 --> 01:07:03.900
underwriters have peculiar
practices in issuing them.

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:09.607
It tends to go like this:
underwriters tend--and there's

01:07:09.607 --> 01:07:15.730
been a lot of documentation of
this--to under price IPOs.

01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:21.531
That is, they sell them for
less then they could get and

01:07:21.531 --> 01:07:26.699
that means that IPOs tend to be
oversubscribed.

01:07:26.699 --> 01:07:32.060
This sounds strange--why would
it work this way?

01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:35.109
You can try this;
call your broker,

01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:38.920
if you have a broker--does
anyone here have a broker?

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:42.524
Maybe somebody does.
Think about this anyway--you

01:07:42.524 --> 01:07:47.700
could call a broker and inquire
and say, hey I hear about IPOs;

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:51.356
I'd like to get in on some.
What do you think the broker

01:07:51.356 --> 01:07:53.978
will say?
Well, the broker will say,

01:07:53.978 --> 01:07:56.990
okay let me see what I can do
for you.

01:07:56.990 --> 01:08:01.010
And he doesn't call you back.
You wonder, well why does this

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:05.077
person not want my business?
Well, the reason is that you

01:08:05.077 --> 01:08:08.203
haven't been a good guy;
you haven't been giving the

01:08:08.203 --> 01:08:11.861
broker other business.
And you hear stories about

01:08:11.861 --> 01:08:17.679
IPO's that did spectacularly
well--it jumped 30% on the first

01:08:17.679 --> 01:08:21.170
day and you say,
hey I want that.

01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:26.359
But it becomes sort of a game
that they're playing.

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:28.752
It's a little bit like trying
to get tickets to some rare

01:08:28.752 --> 01:08:30.664
concert.
I mean, people will

01:08:30.664 --> 01:08:35.352
sometimes--or there's someone
coming to Toad's whose--I don't

01:08:35.352 --> 01:08:38.089
go there,
but if you know about someone

01:08:38.089 --> 01:08:41.501
who is very famous coming to
Toad's and you have trouble

01:08:41.501 --> 01:08:43.439
getting tickets.
Is that right?

01:08:43.439 --> 01:08:45.039
Has anything like this happened
here?

01:08:45.039 --> 01:08:48.030
It happened somewhere anyway
and so you might end up standing

01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:50.921
in line for hours for the first
time when the ticket office

01:08:50.921 --> 01:08:53.884
opens.
Then it sets up rumors going

01:08:53.884 --> 01:08:58.460
that, wow, this is a difficult
concert to get into.

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:02.845
People start trading the
tickets afterwards or someone's

01:09:02.845 --> 01:09:07.390
out there asking more money than
it says on the ticket.

01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:11.202
Well, you have to understand
that that whole event was staged

01:09:11.202 --> 01:09:14.053
by an impresario.
So, there's someone who's

01:09:14.053 --> 01:09:17.340
responsible for the reputation
of this performer.

01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:20.831
This guy says there's no way
that our performer is going to

01:09:20.831 --> 01:09:23.360
go in and perform to a half
empty house;

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.825
we've got to pack them in;
we want people lining up on the

01:09:26.825 --> 01:09:30.516
streets because it gives a sense
of excitement that this person

01:09:30.516 --> 01:09:32.619
is a star.
You know this, right?

01:09:32.619 --> 01:09:36.918
These stars are managed and
they're not just spectacularly

01:09:36.918 --> 01:09:39.993
good singers;
the impresario is critically

01:09:39.993 --> 01:09:43.740
important in maintaining the
career of a singer and the

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:47.210
impresario is very concerned
about appearances.

01:09:47.210 --> 01:09:51.433
So, you don't want to charge a
really high price to get into

01:09:51.433 --> 01:09:54.106
Toad's because,
then it would only be wealthy

01:09:54.106 --> 01:09:56.869
people from the suburbs who
would be coming and it would

01:09:56.869 --> 01:09:59.130
destroy the whole atmosphere of
the place.

01:09:59.130 --> 01:10:02.474
So, you've got to charge
reasonably low-priced tickets

01:10:02.474 --> 01:10:06.135
and then a lot of people will
come flocking to you and then

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:08.470
that would create the
excitement.

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:11.484
The underwriters do the same
thing with IPOs,

01:10:11.484 --> 01:10:15.047
so they underprice them
typically and it creates this

01:10:15.047 --> 01:10:18.609
huge excitement about,
can I get in on this IPO?

01:10:18.609 --> 01:10:25.540
That excitement generates more
business and it also generates a

01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:31.668
reputation for the underwriter.
People see the tombstone and

01:10:31.668 --> 01:10:35.500
they know that this IPO did
extremely well;

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:39.506
it jumped a high amount in the
first day and people think this

01:10:39.506 --> 01:10:43.039
underwriter is really something.
I want to get in on other

01:10:43.039 --> 01:10:46.252
offerings of that underwriter.
So, the reputation of the

01:10:46.252 --> 01:10:49.140
underwriter grows;
it's really a reputation

01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:52.899
business and these people know
something about investor

01:10:52.899 --> 01:10:56.727
psychology and you might
consider it some kind of market

01:10:56.727 --> 01:11:00.398
manipulation.
It's all perfectly legal

01:11:00.398 --> 01:11:05.939
because the SEC allows this kind
of thing but--anyway,

01:11:05.939 --> 01:11:10.067
coming back to--the problem
that we're having now is that

01:11:10.067 --> 01:11:14.489
I'm emphasizing that investment
bankers need a reputation.

01:11:14.489 --> 01:11:17.699
Their whole business is a
reputation business.

01:11:17.699 --> 01:11:21.502
When something happens to Bear
Stearns, it's critical for the

01:11:21.502 --> 01:11:24.350
whole industry.
Now, when it's happening

01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:28.406
repeatedly to various other
banks, it becomes a critical

01:11:28.406 --> 01:11:31.935
turning point.
The stock market went up a lot

01:11:31.935 --> 01:11:35.954
yesterday because of the
encouraging news that some of

01:11:35.954 --> 01:11:40.657
these investment banks were able
to raise more capital and it's

01:11:40.657 --> 01:11:43.852
an ongoing saga,
but it's all a saga that's

01:11:43.852 --> 01:11:46.010
played out in terms of
investment.

01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:49.574
So, I find it difficult to
predict what's going to happen

01:11:49.574 --> 01:11:52.229
next.
It's very hard to know.

01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:55.891
Right now--as of yesterday,
we had some encouraging news

01:11:55.891 --> 01:12:00.020
but this is something that we'll
just have to keep watching.

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:02.539
I think this will play out over
years.

01:12:02.539 --> 01:12:05.004
This thing is not going to be
over tomorrow,

01:12:05.004 --> 01:12:08.501
so we'll have more interesting
things to talk about later this

01:12:08.501 --> 01:12:11.826
semester and there will be
things to watch--to follow up on

01:12:11.826 --> 01:12:15.046
over the years.
Okay, so we're going to talk

01:12:15.046 --> 01:12:18.000
next period about investment
management.

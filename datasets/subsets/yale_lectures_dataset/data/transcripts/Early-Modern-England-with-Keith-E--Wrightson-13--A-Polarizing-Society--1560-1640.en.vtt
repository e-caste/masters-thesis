00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.142
Prof: Okay.
 

00:00:03.142 --> 00:00:06.470
Well last time I was presenting
a kind of panorama of economic

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.659
expansion;
on the whole,

00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:11.050
a very upbeat story.
 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.422
It helps to explain how the
long population growth of the

00:00:15.422 --> 00:00:19.638
late sixteenth and early
seventeenth centuries was able

00:00:19.638 --> 00:00:21.200
to be sustained.
 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.230
And yet, as the final table on
last-time's handout showed,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.433
there's also reason to doubt
whether the expansion was

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:32.250
sufficient,
or whether the new wealth that

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.130
was being created was well
enough distributed in society,

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.680
to avoid some real problems.
 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.937
Especially, real wages
continued to fall and there were

00:00:42.937 --> 00:00:47.510
complaints of a growing problem
of poverty and vagrancy.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.000
So there are paradoxes in the
situation.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.840
And to get the economic
expansion into perspective,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.145
we have to look a little more
closely at how it actually

00:00:57.145 --> 00:01:01.060
impacted on people from
different social groups.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.527
Inevitably that involves a
certain amount of generalization

00:01:04.527 --> 00:01:07.635
but I'll also try to give you
examples of people from

00:01:07.635 --> 00:01:11.402
different groups which will help
to give it something of a human

00:01:11.402 --> 00:01:12.060
face.
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.296
So, let's start by looking,
as usual, at the top and at

00:01:16.296 --> 00:01:19.985
what was happening to the
landlords, the gentry,

00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:21.319
the nobility.
 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:25.995
It's really one of the striking
features of English society in

00:01:25.995 --> 00:01:30.441
this period that many of the
nobility and gentry identified

00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:34.580
themselves very closely with
economic innovations.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.670
Their imperative was to
maintain and,

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.358
if possible,
expand their estate incomes and

00:01:41.358 --> 00:01:45.647
in doing so they became very
deeply involved in the

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:50.280
commercial restructuring of the
country's economy.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.800
That's rather unusual for a
traditional ruling class.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.784
On the whole,
such people tend to rely more

00:01:56.784 --> 00:02:00.691
upon their social privileges
than upon trying to improve

00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:02.540
their competitiveness.
 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.608
But, certainly,
the gentry and the aristocracy,

00:02:05.608 --> 00:02:08.609
or many of them,
did make real efforts of that

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:09.210
kind.
 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.866
And you get,
basically, an acceleration of

00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:15.043
the trends which had already
become visible in the

00:02:15.043 --> 00:02:18.348
mid-sixteenth century:
a lot more careful management

00:02:18.348 --> 00:02:21.978
of their estates in order to
produce more from their home

00:02:21.978 --> 00:02:25.608
farms for the market and in
order to get a greater rental

00:02:25.608 --> 00:02:26.710
income.
 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.044
That often involved extending
the use of leasehold tenure,

00:02:31.044 --> 00:02:34.240
tenure of land just like a
modern lease;

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.997
and wiping away the old,
rather inflexible,

00:02:36.997 --> 00:02:40.937
customary tenures so that they
had a more flexible management

00:02:40.937 --> 00:02:42.710
of their rental income.
 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.669
There was also something I
touched on last time:

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:49.073
a good deal of reorganizing
their estates into enclosed

00:02:49.073 --> 00:02:52.160
farms, for which they could get
better rents.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.186
And in general,
every effort being made to edge

00:02:56.186 --> 00:02:59.598
rents upwards when opportunity
arose.

00:02:59.598 --> 00:03:03.075
And in general,
the landlord class did pretty

00:03:03.075 --> 00:03:03.628
well.
 

00:03:03.628 --> 00:03:07.044
Of course a lot depended upon
the fortunes of particular

00:03:07.044 --> 00:03:10.770
individuals and their personal
quirks and characteristics.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.699
To take, for example,
the Verney family,

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.500
who had substantial estates in
Buckinghamshire,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.240
just to the north-west of
London: Sir Edmund Verney,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.128
who lived in the late sixteenth
and early seventeenth centuries,

00:03:22.128 --> 00:03:25.431
was a man who was principally
interested in forging a

00:03:25.431 --> 00:03:27.210
political career at court.
 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.560
That was very expensive.
 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.478
He had to sink a lot of his
income into fortifying his

00:03:33.478 --> 00:03:37.619
position at the centre and as a
result he incurred pretty

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:39.319
considerable debts.
 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.877
He succeeded quite well;
he became King Charles I's

00:03:42.877 --> 00:03:43.970
Standard Bearer.
 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.562
In fact, he died in one of the
earliest battles of the English

00:03:47.562 --> 00:03:49.919
Civil War bearing the King's
Standard.

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.160
But his son,
Sir Ralph, was of a rather

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.907
different nature;
he actually took a different

00:03:54.907 --> 00:03:56.710
side in the English Civil War.
 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.079
And when the War was over he
devoted himself assiduously to

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.525
restoring and improving the
rather depleted inheritance he'd

00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:09.183
received from his father;
involved in all the kinds of

00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:12.288
measures of estate management
that I've briefly mentioned.

00:04:12.288 --> 00:04:16.516
Indeed, Sir Ralph was so keen
to rebuild the family's fortunes

00:04:16.516 --> 00:04:20.189
that when his first wife died he
remained celibate;

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:22.250
he didn't remarry.
 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.180
He didn't want any more
children.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.891
He didn't want the risk of the
estate having to be divided

00:04:27.891 --> 00:04:31.211
amongst more children,
since he already had a number

00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:33.100
who had survived infancy.
 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.180
So, different personalities,
different outcomes;

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.370
but all part of the same
process.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.665
In general, the income of the
gentry and the nobility was

00:04:44.665 --> 00:04:45.800
expanding.
 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.064
And much of it was spent,
not only upon extending and

00:04:51.064 --> 00:04:56.024
improving their estates,
but upon various kinds of

00:04:56.024 --> 00:04:58.860
conspicuous consumption.
 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.245
It's a great age for the
rebuilding of the manor house's

00:05:01.245 --> 00:05:01.939
of the gentry.
 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:04.620
Many of the lovely country
houses which still survive were

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.505
built in this period,
or rebuilt, as well as some of

00:05:07.505 --> 00:05:09.790
the great 'prodigy houses' of
the age.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.939
The great mansions:
Burghley House near Stamford

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:16.461
which is up here in East Anglia;
or Kirkby Hall in

00:05:16.461 --> 00:05:19.966
Northamptonshire,
it's another very good example,

00:05:19.966 --> 00:05:23.398
that's over here,
the splendid mansion from this

00:05:23.398 --> 00:05:25.370
period which survives.
 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.589
They went in for more elaborate
furnishing and lifestyles and,

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:31.908
in addition,
this was a period when many of

00:05:31.908 --> 00:05:34.386
the gentry and nobility,
the wealthier ones,

00:05:34.386 --> 00:05:36.620
began to spend part of the year
in London.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.583
It sees the beginnings of the
development of what became known

00:05:40.583 --> 00:05:43.701
as the 'London Season':
the habit of spending the

00:05:43.701 --> 00:05:47.339
winter in town and being absent
from their estates,

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:51.149
which were run by stewards for
long periods of the year.

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:54.812
This resulted in something of
an urbanization of gentry

00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:56.815
culture,
something which has been,

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:59.339
recently,
very well studied by Julia

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:03.430
Merritt in a book on the
emerging West End of London;

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.350
the elite aristocratic enclaves
around the royal palaces.

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.771
To give you an idea of the kind
of proportion of these people

00:06:10.771 --> 00:06:14.182
who might be in town,
in 1632 King Charles I,

00:06:14.182 --> 00:06:19.069
in the circumstances of a
harvest emergency,

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:23.161
ordered the gentry to return to
their estates to keep order and

00:06:23.161 --> 00:06:25.670
to see to the needs of local
people.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.706
He had to fine 250 members of
the nobility and gentry who were

00:06:29.706 --> 00:06:33.807
resident in London and didn't go
home when they were ordered to

00:06:33.807 --> 00:06:34.470
do so.
 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.190
Given that the great gentry and
nobility numbered,

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.059
perhaps, 2,000 families,
that's a very significant

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:45.322
proportion of them who were
resident in London and were

00:06:45.322 --> 00:06:47.930
fined for failing to go home.
 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.250
Well, if this was a good time
on the whole,

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.610
for landlords,
if they used the opportunity

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.130
sensibly,
if we turn to their tenantry,

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.459
to the yeomen and husbandman,
one finds a more checkered

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:01.379
picture.
 

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:05.485
Opportunities to improve
incomes were also common amongst

00:07:05.485 --> 00:07:07.759
the more substantial farmers.
 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:12.680
Those who had a big farm with a
substantial surplus to market,

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.908
were actually very well placed
to benefit from rising prices

00:07:16.908 --> 00:07:20.850
and for the growth of the market
for their products,

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:24.889
be it food-stuff or
agricultural raw materials.

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:29.319
Many of these yeomen were
extremely commercially astute.

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:32.312
A very good example is a man
called Robert Loder,

00:07:32.312 --> 00:07:34.995
here's his name,
whose farm accounts survive

00:07:34.995 --> 00:07:36.180
from the 1610s.
 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.000
He lived just to the west of
London in the county of

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.899
Berkshire.
 

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:45.315
Robert Loder calculated every
year exactly how much money he

00:07:45.315 --> 00:07:47.860
was making from different crops.
 

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.699
He took decisions about how to
vary his cropping pattern in

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:55.411
accordance with price trends,
especially the prices which he

00:07:55.411 --> 00:07:57.759
could get in London,
and so forth.

00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:00.146
He even went so far,
at one point,

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:04.052
as to actually calculate the
value of the dung that his

00:08:04.052 --> 00:08:07.019
pigeons deposited in his pigeon
loft.

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:10.324
He figured it out,
what it was worth to him if he

00:08:10.324 --> 00:08:13.009
used it as fertilizer in his
gardens.

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:16.959
This is commercial rationality
of a high order.

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:21.137
He also calculated how much
money his horses made for him

00:08:21.137 --> 00:08:24.269
over and above what he had to
feed them.

00:08:24.269 --> 00:08:27.494
He then proceeded to do the
same calculation for his

00:08:27.494 --> 00:08:28.189
servants.
 

00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:32.359
Well, Robert Loder had nothing
to learn about economic

00:08:32.359 --> 00:08:36.686
rationality and his basic
attitudes are not untypical of

00:08:36.686 --> 00:08:40.070
this kind of substantial yeomen
farmer.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.167
Many such people were willing
to expand their operations if

00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:46.067
they got the opportunity;
if land came available on the

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:48.129
local land market they would
snap it up.

00:08:48.129 --> 00:08:51.100
They were able to pay higher
rents.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.048
They were in an excellent
competitive position and as a

00:08:54.048 --> 00:08:57.380
result, you get a general shift
in lowland England towards the

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.129
building up of larger farms.
 

00:08:59.129 --> 00:09:01.179
In the county of Essex,
for example,

00:09:01.179 --> 00:09:04.168
here to the east of London,
it was very commercially

00:09:04.168 --> 00:09:04.928
oriented.
 

00:09:04.928 --> 00:09:07.250
By the early seventeenth
century, nine percent,

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.729
approximately,
of the tenants held sixty-one

00:09:10.729 --> 00:09:15.783
percent of the land,
built up in these large yeomen

00:09:15.783 --> 00:09:16.850
holdings.
 

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.432
And there's abundant evidence
of the prosperity of the

00:09:19.432 --> 00:09:19.970
yeomanry.
 

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:21.700
It was a great age for them.
 

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.549
This period has been described
by historians of housing as the

00:09:25.549 --> 00:09:27.570
age of the 'Great Rebuilding'.
 

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.254
And by that they mean not only
the houses of the gentry,

00:09:30.254 --> 00:09:33.330
which I've already mentioned,
but the houses of the yeomanry.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.307
It was a period when many of
the farm houses inherited from

00:09:37.307 --> 00:09:40.600
the late medieval period were
being remodeled.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.360
It was very common,
for example,

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.371
they tended in the late
medieval period to be what was

00:09:45.371 --> 00:09:49.116
known as a 'hall house',
which was basically one large

00:09:49.116 --> 00:09:52.298
room with some partitions and a
fireplace,

00:09:52.298 --> 00:09:56.601
the smoke from which would just
be emitted through a whole in

00:09:56.601 --> 00:09:57.389
the roof.
 

00:09:57.389 --> 00:10:00.009
This is a period when you see
people building great,

00:10:00.009 --> 00:10:02.725
central chimney stacks,
so that they could have

00:10:02.725 --> 00:10:05.028
fireplaces and get rid of the
smoke,

00:10:05.028 --> 00:10:07.399
making the whole of the
interior more comfortable.

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:11.142
They tended to divide off the
top of the house and to make

00:10:11.142 --> 00:10:13.494
separate,
private chambers above,

00:10:13.494 --> 00:10:16.419
and frequently they would add
staircases,

00:10:16.419 --> 00:10:18.340
of course, to get up there.
 

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.269
They might extend their homes
in all kinds of ways.

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:25.144
Many of these houses,
the great yeomen houses of this

00:10:25.144 --> 00:10:27.379
period, survive to this day.
 

00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:31.200
When you look at the
inventories of these people,

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.684
which were taken when they
died, they also reveal a marked

00:10:34.684 --> 00:10:38.110
increase in the value of their
household goods and in the

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:41.779
elaboration of the types of
goods that people possessed.

00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:44.402
William Harrison,
a clergyman who described all

00:10:44.402 --> 00:10:47.879
of this happening in the later
years of Elizabeth's reign,

00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:51.440
said that despite the fact that
higher rents were being paid,

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.294
many of the villagers in his
area--the yeomen farmers are the

00:10:55.294 --> 00:10:59.389
ones he was thinking of--
were able, he said "yet to

00:10:59.389 --> 00:11:03.427
find the means to obtain and
achieve such furniture as

00:11:03.427 --> 00:11:06.548
heretofore hath been
unpossible."

00:11:06.548 --> 00:11:09.504
And he went on to specify what
that involved:

00:11:09.504 --> 00:11:13.065
joined furniture made by
joiners, proper joined chairs

00:11:13.065 --> 00:11:15.649
rather than stools;
nice tables;

00:11:15.649 --> 00:11:18.788
bedsteads;
soft furnishings.

00:11:18.788 --> 00:11:22.794
There's a proliferation in
inventories of cushions and of

00:11:22.794 --> 00:11:23.940
carpet cloths.
 

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.595
Carpets were--these were
oriental carpets being imported

00:11:27.595 --> 00:11:29.190
by the Levant Company.
 

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.846
They were put on tables,
you didn't put a carpet on the

00:11:31.846 --> 00:11:33.130
floor;
it was far too valuable for

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:33.330
that.
 

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.210
You put it on the table,
to decorate the table.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:40.094
Some representations of
interior scenes in this period

00:11:40.094 --> 00:11:43.100
show that: the carpet across the
table.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.096
And you find them also having
more elaborate table-wear and

00:11:46.096 --> 00:11:49.173
more elaborate kitchen-wear,
all sorts of odd products

00:11:49.173 --> 00:11:52.120
turning up in their inventories:
apple toasters,

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.490
for example.
 

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.967
An apple toaster,
something Crate and Barrel

00:11:55.967 --> 00:11:59.253
should perhaps try to imitate,
to hold in the fire with an

00:11:59.253 --> 00:12:02.379
apple in it, and so on;
all kinds of things.

00:12:02.379 --> 00:12:05.379
It's been described by one
historian of material culture as

00:12:05.379 --> 00:12:07.136
"a new household
culture"

00:12:07.136 --> 00:12:10.686
with much greater comfort,
much greater convenience,

00:12:10.686 --> 00:12:13.100
being enjoyed by these people.
 

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.716
They could also put their money
into other things:

00:12:15.716 --> 00:12:18.548
bigger dowries for their
daughters so they could marry

00:12:18.548 --> 00:12:19.028
well.
 

00:12:19.028 --> 00:12:22.553
A study of Kent shows that in
the reign of Elizabeth,

00:12:22.553 --> 00:12:26.418
the dowries being paid by
yeomen with their daughters rose

00:12:26.418 --> 00:12:29.129
six-fold in the course of her
reign.

00:12:29.129 --> 00:12:31.941
And they could also spend the
money to have their sons

00:12:31.941 --> 00:12:34.489
apprenticed into trade,
into professions,

00:12:34.489 --> 00:12:37.240
sent to school,
in some cases even to the

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.759
universities,
something that I'll return to

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:42.460
on another occasion.
 

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:49.548
Well, the yeomanry were the big
fish of village society.

00:12:49.548 --> 00:12:52.788
Things were a little more
difficult for the little

00:12:52.788 --> 00:12:56.690
minnows--the smaller guys,
the family-farming husbandman.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:58.200
Some of them did fine.
 

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.575
If they lived near a city they
might have good marketing

00:13:00.575 --> 00:13:02.764
opportunities,
they could specialize in

00:13:02.764 --> 00:13:05.794
producing fruit or
market-gardening or dairying and

00:13:05.794 --> 00:13:07.250
could do pretty well.
 

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:10.259
You also get a lot of
husbandman diversifying their

00:13:10.259 --> 00:13:13.149
activities into part-time
industrial activity.

00:13:13.149 --> 00:13:16.629
Over in the West Midlands,
in the metal working districts,

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:19.788
the inventories of scythe
makers, for example,

00:13:19.788 --> 00:13:23.572
can be quite interesting,
indicating that these people

00:13:23.572 --> 00:13:27.378
were engaged in farming,
but also in producing scythe

00:13:27.378 --> 00:13:31.000
blades on the side;
they had forges.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.277
Generally, they would work at
that in the slack periods of the

00:13:35.277 --> 00:13:36.678
agricultural year.
 

00:13:36.678 --> 00:13:40.775
But for many of these small
guys, the period was fraught

00:13:40.775 --> 00:13:41.668
with risk.
 

00:13:41.668 --> 00:13:45.456
The crucial issue was whether
they could sustain their small

00:13:45.456 --> 00:13:48.279
farming economy under changing
conditions.

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:51.707
These were the people who would
have most difficulty meeting

00:13:51.707 --> 00:13:52.580
higher rents.
 

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.860
They might have a poor
competitive position.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.980
One agricultural writer
described them as "weak and

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.230
un-stocked husbandmen."
 

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:05.700
They lacked capital;
they produced smaller crops;

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.509
they made smaller profits;
they had fewer livestock.

00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:13.307
They couldn't really,
seriously contemplate indulging

00:14:13.307 --> 00:14:16.629
in expensive or risky
innovations.

00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:20.010
And they were also very
vulnerable to temporary crises

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.500
like those produced by bad
harvests,

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.235
which could wipe out their
surplus and force them into

00:14:26.235 --> 00:14:26.730
debt.
 

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.972
Some of these people became
vulnerable and were driven to

00:14:30.972 --> 00:14:34.989
the wall and their land was
taken up by more ambitious

00:14:34.989 --> 00:14:36.048
neighbors.
 

00:14:36.048 --> 00:14:37.854
And, in general,
there's a diminution in the

00:14:37.854 --> 00:14:39.240
numbers of these small farmers.
 

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.491
As the big farms are growing,
many of the small ones are

00:14:42.491 --> 00:14:43.379
disappearing.
 

00:14:43.379 --> 00:14:46.825
A whittling away of small
tenancies, which,

00:14:46.825 --> 00:14:51.173
in turn, made it rather
difficult for the young to get

00:14:51.173 --> 00:14:54.620
onto the land to establish a
foothold.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.490
More of the young people from
rural families,

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.365
after their period as servants
in the households of larger

00:15:01.365 --> 00:15:04.230
farmers,
were more likely to spend their

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:08.330
lives as agricultural wage
laborers than getting land of

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:09.298
their own.
 

00:15:09.298 --> 00:15:14.799
So, the fortunes of different
groups in rural society varied.

00:15:14.799 --> 00:15:17.080
They're broadly fairly clear.
 

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.190
One can generalize with some
confidence.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:23.330
In the towns the picture's a
little less clear.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:27.139
Clearly there was a lot of
commercial development and

00:15:27.139 --> 00:15:30.585
business opportunity,
but this was a period when

00:15:30.585 --> 00:15:33.149
business was fraught with risk.
 

00:15:33.149 --> 00:15:36.308
Finding the capital to set up
could be difficult.

00:15:36.308 --> 00:15:40.874
Keeping businesses going could
be difficult in a period when

00:15:40.874 --> 00:15:43.658
cash flow could be hard to
manage.

00:15:43.658 --> 00:15:46.417
People had to keep a good
balance between their debts and

00:15:46.417 --> 00:15:48.529
credits;
that could be very difficult.

00:15:48.529 --> 00:15:51.808
Accumulation of wealth was
often very slow.

00:15:51.808 --> 00:15:55.596
And even the successful could
be wiped out by temporary

00:15:55.596 --> 00:15:57.658
economic crises;
by fraud;

00:15:57.658 --> 00:16:00.058
by fire--there's no fire
insurance;

00:16:00.058 --> 00:16:03.379
by shipwreck--there's no marine
insurance;

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:06.620
and so forth.
 

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.759
It was to try to counter some
of these insecurities that some

00:16:10.759 --> 00:16:14.899
of the principal merchants of
England's cities preferred,

00:16:14.899 --> 00:16:17.514
if possible,
to be members of chartered

00:16:17.514 --> 00:16:18.889
trading companies.
 

00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:22.269
Those companies which had a
monopoly of particular branches

00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:24.990
of trade,
the ones I mentioned last time,

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:28.639
and which laid down rules for
the conduct of the trade;

00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:32.607
rules which were generally
aimed at securing stable profits

00:16:32.607 --> 00:16:35.139
for all the members of the
company.

00:16:35.139 --> 00:16:40.447
And to restrict the numbers of
people who were involved in

00:16:40.447 --> 00:16:42.308
particular trades.
 

00:16:42.308 --> 00:16:45.604
It's true that no trading
monopoly could protect a

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:50.303
merchant from shipwreck,
or piracy, or the collapse of

00:16:50.303 --> 00:16:52.499
demand,
but, nonetheless,

00:16:52.499 --> 00:16:55.250
one can generalize to some
degree,

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.178
about the way in which they
fared.

00:16:58.178 --> 00:17:00.988
For some, who were members of
established companies,

00:17:00.988 --> 00:17:02.639
things could go pretty well.
 

00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:05.798
Take, for example,
the Levant Company.

00:17:05.798 --> 00:17:09.236
The Levant Company traded to
the Mediterranean,

00:17:09.236 --> 00:17:12.150
especially the eastern
Mediterranean.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.130
In 1570 it was founded.
 

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.941
By the early seventeenth
century to become a member of

00:17:17.941 --> 00:17:21.282
the Levant Company meant laying
down two to three hundred pounds

00:17:21.282 --> 00:17:24.238
as membership fee;
quite a substantial sum of

00:17:24.238 --> 00:17:24.720
money.
 

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.930
By the early seventeenth
century also,

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.900
this company has been described
as,

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.851
I'm quoting,
"a highly ramified network

00:17:31.851 --> 00:17:34.939
of interconnecting family
relationships,"

00:17:34.939 --> 00:17:38.851
the members of which were often
related to one another and

00:17:38.851 --> 00:17:41.940
controlling a great share of the
trade.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:46.632
One contemporary described them
as "born rich and adding

00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:51.558
wealth to wealth by trading in a
beaten road to wealth."

00:17:51.558 --> 00:17:56.076
In 1627 there were only
twenty-four men who controlled

00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:59.568
fifty-four percent of the Levant
trade.

00:17:59.568 --> 00:18:01.890
So, members of the great
companies,

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:06.737
having established the trade,
could restrict it in various

00:18:06.737 --> 00:18:11.328
ways in order to ensure some
stability in their trading

00:18:11.328 --> 00:18:12.180
lives.
 

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.921
It was members of that company
who were later to go on to found

00:18:15.921 --> 00:18:17.430
the East India Company.
 

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.441
Well, in addition,
though, there were certain

00:18:20.441 --> 00:18:22.288
additional opportunities.
 

00:18:22.288 --> 00:18:26.136
Another way to prosper,
if you had the nerve and would

00:18:26.136 --> 00:18:28.823
take the risks,
was to get involved in

00:18:28.823 --> 00:18:31.509
pioneering altogether new
trades.

00:18:31.509 --> 00:18:35.000
And the most significant of
those were the American trades.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.130
With the early establishment of
colonies in America,

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:43.529
the initial opportunities were
not obviously good and many

00:18:43.529 --> 00:18:47.930
members of established trading
companies were reluctant to

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:48.779
invest.
 

00:18:48.779 --> 00:18:51.759
That left the path open for
those who were prepared to take

00:18:51.759 --> 00:18:53.970
the risks of involvement and
very often,

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.810
those who got involved in the
American trades were men of

00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:00.058
lesser standing in the merchant
community: smaller merchants,

00:19:00.058 --> 00:19:01.873
even shopkeepers,
ships captains,

00:19:01.873 --> 00:19:04.819
people like that who were
willing to get involved;

00:19:04.819 --> 00:19:08.170
new men, you could say.
 

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.057
They built up,
as you know,

00:19:10.057 --> 00:19:14.557
a very substantial trade in the
course of the early seventeenth

00:19:14.557 --> 00:19:15.430
century.
 

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:18.045
To just give you an example of
one of these people,

00:19:18.045 --> 00:19:19.720
a man called Maurice Thompson.
 

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:23.240
Maurice Thompson was the
younger son of a gentry family.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.692
He got a little bit of capital
from his family but not much

00:19:25.692 --> 00:19:27.452
more;
he didn't inherit the family

00:19:27.452 --> 00:19:27.868
estate.
 

00:19:27.868 --> 00:19:31.710
He came from Hertfordshire,
just to the north of London.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:34.710
How he came to go to Virginia
is uncertain,

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:38.278
but he was there by the time he
was in his mid-teens and he got

00:19:38.278 --> 00:19:41.442
involved on the ground floor
with the development of the

00:19:41.442 --> 00:19:42.480
tobacco trade.
 

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.263
Pretty soon he owned land,
he owned a ship,

00:19:45.263 --> 00:19:49.375
he became involved in the trade
in tobacco and in the supply of

00:19:49.375 --> 00:19:51.630
goods needed by the colonists.
 

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.558
He expanded his operations;
he married well;

00:19:54.558 --> 00:19:57.529
he became a significant figure
amongst the leaders of the

00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:59.598
Virginia colony as quite a young
man.

00:19:59.598 --> 00:20:03.643
By the time he was in his early
thirties he was back in London,

00:20:03.643 --> 00:20:07.490
managing much of the--a good
part of the Virginia trade from

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:08.730
his base there.
 

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.066
And, indeed,
he went on to expand his

00:20:11.066 --> 00:20:15.026
operations to become involved in
the Indian Ocean and in other

00:20:15.026 --> 00:20:15.868
ventures.
 

00:20:15.868 --> 00:20:18.866
If you're interested in that
kind of person and that kind of

00:20:18.866 --> 00:20:20.710
development,
Robert Brenner's book,

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:22.380
Merchants and
Revolution,

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:28.048
the first section is a splendid
depiction of these shifts and

00:20:28.048 --> 00:20:33.905
developments in the last years
of Elizabeth and under the early

00:20:33.905 --> 00:20:35.038
Stuarts.
 

00:20:35.038 --> 00:20:38.463
At lower levels in the urban
hierarchy, the capital that

00:20:38.463 --> 00:20:42.200
people needed to set up in
business was gradually growing.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.590
That made it a little more
difficult to establish yourself

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.981
as an independent master and a
great many people had to be

00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:52.910
content with serving as skilled
craftsmen working for others,

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:56.474
whereas previously they might
have hoped to become independent

00:20:56.474 --> 00:20:57.058
masters.
 

00:20:57.058 --> 00:21:01.476
Even skilled employees were
often forced to work longer and

00:21:01.476 --> 00:21:04.750
more intensively,
if the work was available,

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:08.328
in order to sustain their
living standards.

00:21:08.328 --> 00:21:12.258
To give you a specific example
of this, I've got some figures

00:21:12.258 --> 00:21:15.989
here relating to building
craftsmen from the town of Hull,

00:21:15.989 --> 00:21:17.430
on the east coast.
 

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:20.699
Donald Woodward,
in a very imaginative piece of

00:21:20.699 --> 00:21:24.038
research, worked out the price
of foodstuffs;

00:21:24.038 --> 00:21:28.500
found the wages being paid to
craftsmen of different kinds;

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.515
and then figured out how many
days you would need to work to

00:21:31.515 --> 00:21:33.558
feed husband,
wife and three children.

00:21:33.558 --> 00:21:35.410
So, here are some of his
figures.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:38.330
The best paid men in the 1560s
could have fed their families

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.460
with a hundred and fifty-three
days work.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.801
By the 1630s,
with rising prices,

00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:46.901
and wages not rising so fast,
two hundred and twenty-nine

00:21:46.901 --> 00:21:47.558
days.
 

00:21:47.558 --> 00:21:51.246
The worst paid,
a hundred and ninety-two days

00:21:51.246 --> 00:21:54.682
in the 1560s,
three hundred and six by the

00:21:54.682 --> 00:21:55.519
1630s.
 

00:21:55.519 --> 00:22:00.977
So, this was the experience of
some of the craftsmen of the

00:22:00.977 --> 00:22:01.730
towns.
 

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:04.184
In short then,
urban manufactures and the

00:22:04.184 --> 00:22:07.990
urban manufacturing system was
becoming less small master-based

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:11.000
and rather more capitalistically
structured,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.277
with a larger proportion of
urban craftsmen having to cope

00:22:15.277 --> 00:22:18.803
with the difficulties and
uncertainties of their

00:22:18.803 --> 00:22:21.130
dependence upon wage labor.
 

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:26.230
Well, much of the same was true
of the industries of the

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.528
countryside.
 

00:22:27.528 --> 00:22:30.009
In Somersetshire,
in the West Country,

00:22:30.009 --> 00:22:34.058
where the cloth industry was
the major industry in the 1620s,

00:22:34.058 --> 00:22:36.813
one contemporary described the
"multitudes of poor

00:22:36.813 --> 00:22:39.006
cottages"
which were to be found in the

00:22:39.006 --> 00:22:40.230
cloth-weaving areas.
 

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.932
And he continued they are
"stuffed with poor people

00:22:43.932 --> 00:22:47.029
which get most of their living
by spinning,

00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:50.671
by carding, and such
employments about wool and

00:22:50.671 --> 00:22:51.779
cloth."
 

00:22:51.779 --> 00:22:55.909
And they gained their living
most of the time,

00:22:55.909 --> 00:23:01.415
but he added that when trade
was dead "they know not how

00:23:01.415 --> 00:23:05.155
to live,"
In town and country alike,

00:23:05.155 --> 00:23:09.457
then, what contemporaries
described as the "laboring

00:23:09.457 --> 00:23:12.528
poor" was emerging as a
larger,

00:23:12.528 --> 00:23:15.450
more wage-dependent population
emerged;

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:20.119
probably half the population by
the mid-seventeenth century,

00:23:20.119 --> 00:23:23.048
to judge by surviving tax
listings.

00:23:23.048 --> 00:23:27.308
Agricultural intensification
and a diversification of

00:23:27.308 --> 00:23:32.141
industry and urban growth all
meant that there was more work

00:23:32.141 --> 00:23:33.779
for such people.
 

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:38.558
But the work was often seasonal;
it was often insecure;

00:23:38.558 --> 00:23:40.601
there was a lot of
under-employment,

00:23:40.601 --> 00:23:43.109
difficulty finding five days
work a week;

00:23:43.109 --> 00:23:45.420
and so forth.
 

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:49.523
And there was the constant
pressure of greater numbers of

00:23:49.523 --> 00:23:51.650
people on the labor market.
 

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:54.435
And it was this,
really, that issued in what's

00:23:54.435 --> 00:23:58.088
sometimes described as a problem
of 'structural poverty'.

00:23:58.088 --> 00:24:03.808
A large number of people whose
very way of life on a day to day

00:24:03.808 --> 00:24:09.160
basis meant periodic hardship
was almost inevitable some of

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.536
the time;
people who faced a situation in

00:24:12.536 --> 00:24:16.467
which the rate of pay for their
labor was such as to mean

00:24:16.467 --> 00:24:20.680
declining capacity to meet the
needs of their households.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.406
And that produced a distinct
life cycle amongst the laboring

00:24:24.406 --> 00:24:24.848
poor.
 

00:24:24.848 --> 00:24:27.854
They could manage pretty well
until they had,

00:24:27.854 --> 00:24:29.630
say, two children or so.
 

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:32.803
They might even have a little
bit of disposable income to

00:24:32.803 --> 00:24:36.162
spend on manufactured goods,
but once they had too many

00:24:36.162 --> 00:24:39.450
mouths to feed,
or if the chief breadwinners

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:42.461
fell sick or injured,
or if there was a trading

00:24:42.461 --> 00:24:44.750
depression,
they could be plunged

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.308
immediately into real hardship.
 

00:24:47.308 --> 00:24:50.810
And in old age,
if they reached old age,

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:55.930
they almost inevitably would be
dependent upon charity.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.972
Many of these people survived
by what's been described as

00:24:58.972 --> 00:25:00.929
"an economy of
makeshifts,"

00:25:00.929 --> 00:25:02.940
it's a phrase of Olwen
Hufton's,

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.740
"an economy of
makeshifts."

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.150
You get by as best you can,
doing what you can.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:12.115
Cottaging where they could;
using the commons if they were

00:25:12.115 --> 00:25:14.606
available;
gleaning the fields after the

00:25:14.606 --> 00:25:18.202
harvest, the poor were allowed
to glean for grains of corn in

00:25:18.202 --> 00:25:21.320
the fields after harvest;
and finding various kinds of

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.000
assistance from their family,
from their neighbors;

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.819
moving around when there seemed
to be better opportunities to

00:25:28.819 --> 00:25:30.910
piece together a living.
 

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.407
And for that reason,
they tended to become

00:25:33.407 --> 00:25:36.698
concentrated in certain areas
where those opportunities

00:25:36.698 --> 00:25:37.430
existed.
 

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:41.308
It was a rather unsettled life
for many of them.

00:25:41.308 --> 00:25:44.391
I'll give you a couple of
examples of these people:

00:25:44.391 --> 00:25:47.595
Margaret Knowsley she came from
Nantwich in Cheshire,

00:25:47.595 --> 00:25:48.890
there's her name.
 

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:54.910
She's visible in the records
between 1613 and 1629.

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:57.328
She was married to a laborer.
 

00:25:57.328 --> 00:26:02.078
We know that she had ten
children between 1613 and 1629.

00:26:02.078 --> 00:26:05.680
Five of her children died in
infancy.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:10.450
Something of her working life
survives in various records.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:16.328
She worked as an ale wife,
making and selling ale;

00:26:16.328 --> 00:26:20.400
she worked as an agricultural
laborer during the appropriate

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.368
seasons;
she did some stocking knitting;

00:26:23.368 --> 00:26:27.000
she acted as a cleaner for the
minister of the parish;

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.270
she's thought to have practiced
some forms of medical skills,

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:34.332
she had some skills in aspects
of midwifery,

00:26:34.332 --> 00:26:35.400
apparently.
 

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.948
She was alleged also,
from time to time,

00:26:37.948 --> 00:26:40.170
to have solicited men for
money.

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:43.574
So, that's "an economy of
makeshifts"

00:26:43.574 --> 00:26:44.240
indeed.
 

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:47.144
Or, another such person,
Henry Savery,

00:26:47.144 --> 00:26:51.230
he's visible in the records
between 1629 and 1636.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:56.440
He came from Stow Bardolph in
the county of Suffolk.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.789
We know a little bit about
Henry.

00:26:57.789 --> 00:27:01.940
In 1629 he was a servant.
 

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.597
He left service and instead of
engaging himself to a new

00:27:05.597 --> 00:27:07.858
master, decided to go to London.
 

00:27:07.858 --> 00:27:11.511
Once he got to London he found
it difficult to find regular

00:27:11.511 --> 00:27:14.220
work so he signed-on for a
voyage on a ship,

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.548
but he wasn't a very good
sailor.

00:27:16.548 --> 00:27:20.083
By the time the ship had got
out into the Thames estuary he

00:27:20.083 --> 00:27:23.434
was suffering from chronic
seasickness and his legs were

00:27:23.434 --> 00:27:24.410
swelling up.
 

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:28.865
So, finding him no use to him,
the shipmaster put him to shore

00:27:28.865 --> 00:27:31.859
and just landed him and
discharged him.

00:27:31.859 --> 00:27:35.000
He went back to London.
 

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.532
There, he was taken by the
constables as a vagrant and sent

00:27:39.532 --> 00:27:41.410
home to Stow Bardolph.
 

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:45.019
In 1635 he decided to try at
his fortunes again.

00:27:45.019 --> 00:27:48.473
He left Stow Bardolph after
haymaking where he'd earned a

00:27:48.473 --> 00:27:51.952
total of seven shillings;
he had seven shillings in his

00:27:51.952 --> 00:27:52.390
purse.
 

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:55.269
He went to the county of
Suffolk--further into the County

00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:58.153
of Suffolk--
and worked in various farms

00:27:58.153 --> 00:28:03.038
there for three months and then
he went off to London again.

00:28:03.038 --> 00:28:05.252
Once again, he found it
difficult to find regular work

00:28:05.252 --> 00:28:07.548
so he began working "up and
down the country,"

00:28:07.548 --> 00:28:08.509
as he described it.
 

00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:13.098
He got as far north as York and
then made his way back again.

00:28:13.098 --> 00:28:16.685
Back in London,
he found himself once again

00:28:16.685 --> 00:28:20.868
arrested as a vagrant and sent
home to Norfolk.

00:28:20.868 --> 00:28:23.359
And there we lose track of
Henry Savery;

00:28:23.359 --> 00:28:27.460
he vanishes from the records.
 

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.210
That's exactly the kind of
person,

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:32.500
moving around,
trying to earn a living where

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.053
he could,
who might have been the sort of

00:28:35.053 --> 00:28:38.695
person who would've signed-on
with a shipmaster in London to

00:28:38.695 --> 00:28:42.585
become an indentured servant in
the new colonies in Virginia and

00:28:42.585 --> 00:28:43.450
Maryland.
 

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:46.787
And indeed, many people who
found their way to London but

00:28:46.787 --> 00:28:49.410
couldn't find a place there did
just that.

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:54.202
In London, there was an
institution charged with the

00:28:54.202 --> 00:28:58.618
oversight of the vagrant poor,
the Bridewell.

00:28:58.618 --> 00:29:03.102
And the governors of the
Bridewell actually dispatched

00:29:03.102 --> 00:29:08.259
over 1,100 people to Virginia
and the West Indies between 1618

00:29:08.259 --> 00:29:09.358
and 1658.
 

00:29:09.358 --> 00:29:13.218
At first they were mostly men,
about ninety percent men,

00:29:13.218 --> 00:29:17.356
but by the 1630s about a third
of them, or close to a third,

00:29:17.356 --> 00:29:18.410
were women.
 

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:22.698
Two thirds of these people who
were sent had been taken by the

00:29:22.698 --> 00:29:25.230
officers on the streets of
London.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:28.229
Some of them were accused of
crime, they might have been

00:29:28.229 --> 00:29:30.519
accused of being pickpockets or
thieves;

00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:32.858
but most of them were simply
out on the streets.

00:29:32.858 --> 00:29:35.605
They were described as
"out after curfew"

00:29:35.605 --> 00:29:38.685
or "nightwalkers"--
that was just loitering

00:29:38.685 --> 00:29:40.960
suspiciously on the streets at
night.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.865
Some of them were former
servants who had no place and

00:29:44.865 --> 00:29:48.182
were on the streets,
and they were sent by the

00:29:48.182 --> 00:29:50.690
Bridewell to the new colonies.
 

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:54.723
One of those who was sent gave
his occupation as "Ballad

00:29:54.723 --> 00:29:58.625
Singer" which makes me
wonder if that's the origins of

00:29:58.625 --> 00:30:01.450
country music
&gt;

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:04.108
I'm serious
&gt;

00:30:04.108 --> 00:30:08.670
In the early twentieth century,
songs collected by folklorists

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:11.646
in the Appalachians,
many of those songs can

00:30:11.646 --> 00:30:14.763
actually be traced back to
printed ballads which are known

00:30:14.763 --> 00:30:18.045
to be sung on the streets of
London in the late sixteenth and

00:30:18.045 --> 00:30:19.848
early seventeenth centuries.
 

00:30:19.848 --> 00:30:25.990
They passed into the oral
culture of the Appalachian area.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:28.868
Well, one can go on about these
people.

00:30:28.868 --> 00:30:31.703
There's a wonderful recent book
by Paul Griffiths called Lost

00:30:31.703 --> 00:30:34.450
Londons which looks closely
at them through the records of

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:35.259
the Bridewell.
 

00:30:35.259 --> 00:30:37.240
The Bridewell kept excellent
records;

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:40.362
they even kept physical
descriptions of some of the

00:30:40.362 --> 00:30:43.921
people they dealt with so they
could identify them if they

00:30:43.921 --> 00:30:45.170
turned up again.
 

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:47.871
And so, we have descriptions
of, you know,

00:30:47.871 --> 00:30:50.309
their stature:
"slender;"

00:30:50.309 --> 00:30:52.720
"well-set;"
"thick-set;"

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.548
one was described as
"great-gutted."

00:30:56.548 --> 00:30:58.670
Their complexion:
"sallow;"

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:01.160
"high-colored;"
"bright;"

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.940
"sad,"
a sad complexion was described.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.930
Their hair color:
"flaxen;"

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:09.515
"dark brown;"
"betwixt auburn and

00:31:09.515 --> 00:31:10.259
flaxen."
 

00:31:10.259 --> 00:31:11.940
All of these descriptions are
entered in the books.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.288
Their clothing:
a woman found on the streets

00:31:15.288 --> 00:31:19.259
wearing a red petticoat and a
white upper-bodice;

00:31:19.259 --> 00:31:22.338
so, poor but colorfully dressed.
 

00:31:22.338 --> 00:31:24.492
Some, of course,
were beggars who were

00:31:24.492 --> 00:31:25.250
near-naked.
 

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:28.057
You get descriptions also of
their medical condition:

00:31:28.057 --> 00:31:30.108
"pock-marked in his
face";

00:31:30.108 --> 00:31:32.088
"a small scar upon his
forehead;"

00:31:32.088 --> 00:31:36.030
"burned in the hand,"
that means someone had been

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:39.087
found guilty of a crime and
branded for future

00:31:39.087 --> 00:31:40.380
identification.
 

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:44.208
And sometimes they were
suffering from disease:

00:31:44.208 --> 00:31:47.798
"palsied;"
"scurvy;"

00:31:47.798 --> 00:31:49.930
"scalded-headed,"
that was very common.

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.880
It meant a kind of scalp
condition.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.558
One man, well,
a boy actually,

00:31:55.558 --> 00:32:00.548
described as "his toes
almost rotted off."

00:32:00.548 --> 00:32:04.309
Others were mentally ill:
"crack-brained;"

00:32:04.309 --> 00:32:06.339
"silly;"
"simple."

00:32:06.339 --> 00:32:08.368
That's how they're described.
 

00:32:08.368 --> 00:32:12.305
One description that arrested
me when reading this was:

00:32:12.305 --> 00:32:15.221
"a Northern man by his
speech,"

00:32:15.221 --> 00:32:19.155
"high-colored,"
"beard close-cut mingled

00:32:19.155 --> 00:32:23.528
with white hair,"
"in a manner crazed."

00:32:23.528 --> 00:32:27.788
And then you get those people
on the streets of London who had

00:32:27.788 --> 00:32:30.862
no known identity,
they turn up in the parish

00:32:30.862 --> 00:32:31.700
records.
 

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.973
The parish of Saint
Bartholomew's,

00:32:33.973 --> 00:32:36.936
for example,
gave assistance to a beggar who

00:32:36.936 --> 00:32:39.970
turned up at the church who had
no name.

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:43.487
They put him down in their
account books as money given to

00:32:43.487 --> 00:32:45.400
"Bartholomew Need."
 

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.186
"Bartholomew Need"
because he came to Saint

00:32:48.186 --> 00:32:49.420
Bartholomew's church.
 

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.798
And you find the children who
were left on the streets.

00:32:51.798 --> 00:32:55.710
Often when they were taken in
by parish authorities,

00:32:55.710 --> 00:33:00.078
they would give them a name:
"Michael Found;"

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:03.588
"Joan Foundbasket"
(a baby found in a

00:33:03.588 --> 00:33:06.573
basket);"
"Porch Wall,"

00:33:06.573 --> 00:33:11.019
she was found in porch of the
church of Saint Andrew by the

00:33:11.019 --> 00:33:13.349
Wall,
so they baptized her

00:33:13.349 --> 00:33:16.919
"Porch Wall";
and so one could go on,

00:33:16.919 --> 00:33:18.450
"Joan Mad."
 

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:21.459
Or those who were sometimes
buried in the parishes,

00:33:21.459 --> 00:33:24.710
found dead on the streets:
"John No Name";

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:32.048
"Jane Nobody."
 

00:33:32.048 --> 00:33:39.108
So, England's increasing income
was very unevenly distributed.

00:33:39.108 --> 00:33:43.467
It was an expanding economy but
one with an expanding problem of

00:33:43.467 --> 00:33:44.920
structural poverty.
 

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.309
It was a commercializing
society in which there were

00:33:48.309 --> 00:33:51.790
great opportunities,
but many of those who had

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:56.240
nothing to sell but their labor
were in a poor competitive

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.298
position and in an exceedingly
risky environment.

00:34:00.298 --> 00:34:03.025
Of course, some aspects of
those insecurities were

00:34:03.025 --> 00:34:06.528
perennial, but at times they
could become particularly acute.

00:34:06.528 --> 00:34:09.500
And the times that stand out
are the 1590s,

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:13.128
which was a time when the
harvest failed four years in a

00:34:13.128 --> 00:34:15.041
row,
food prices rocketed,

00:34:15.041 --> 00:34:18.219
the weaknesses in the economy
were revealed,

00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:20.070
and there was widespread misery.
 

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:24.545
Indeed, in the years 1596 to
1598 there was actual famine in

00:34:24.545 --> 00:34:28.264
the most vulnerable areas;
parts of the far north,

00:34:28.264 --> 00:34:31.940
north-west in particular,
and parts of the far west.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:35.340
There's evidence of actual
death from starvation.

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:40.132
The 1620s was another decade
when there were bad harvests,

00:34:40.132 --> 00:34:44.840
combined, in this case,
with an industrial depression.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.733
War in Europe had dislocated
the markets for some of the

00:34:47.733 --> 00:34:50.309
goods that England exported,
leading to industrial

00:34:50.309 --> 00:34:51.099
depression.
 

00:34:51.099 --> 00:34:54.981
There was widespread
unemployment and poverty in many

00:34:54.981 --> 00:34:56.699
of the weaving areas.
 

00:34:56.699 --> 00:35:00.932
And again, some sinister
evidence of actual famine in

00:35:00.932 --> 00:35:03.619
some of the most exposed areas.
 

00:35:03.619 --> 00:35:06.760
These were the hardest years.
 

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.784
Really acute crises of that
kind, of course,

00:35:09.784 --> 00:35:12.456
were exceptional,
but they revealed the

00:35:12.456 --> 00:35:15.340
weaknesses within society as a
whole.

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:18.469
So, how to conceptualize all of
this?

00:35:18.469 --> 00:35:21.429
Very often historians talk
about these decades,

00:35:21.429 --> 00:35:24.351
these generations at the turn
of the sixteenth and early

00:35:24.351 --> 00:35:27.536
seventeenth centuries,
as witnessing a process of

00:35:27.536 --> 00:35:31.893
"social polarization"
and there's some obvious truth

00:35:31.893 --> 00:35:32.679
in that.
 

00:35:32.679 --> 00:35:37.246
There's a real divergence going
on in living standards and in

00:35:37.246 --> 00:35:40.976
life chances in a more
competitive, commercialized

00:35:40.976 --> 00:35:41.889
economy.
 

00:35:41.889 --> 00:35:43.719
But it's also,
in some ways,

00:35:43.719 --> 00:35:47.380
more complex than simply the
notion of polarization.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.351
In many ways,
the social structure was

00:35:50.351 --> 00:35:54.369
rearticulating into a,
sort of, three-part form.

00:35:54.369 --> 00:35:56.657
There were greater
opportunities,

00:35:56.657 --> 00:35:59.873
on the one hand,
to acquire and to consolidate

00:35:59.873 --> 00:36:00.659
wealth.
 

00:36:00.659 --> 00:36:04.230
There was a greater population
of laboring poor on the other

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:06.530
hand, both of which we've looked
at.

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:08.971
But there was also the
elaboration of what

00:36:08.971 --> 00:36:12.545
contemporaries were beginning to
describe as the "middle

00:36:12.545 --> 00:36:15.344
sort of people,"
between the gentry and the

00:36:15.344 --> 00:36:16.000
poor.
 

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.280
Successful manufacturers and
tradesman,

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:21.784
substantial yeomen farmers,
increasing numbers of people

00:36:21.784 --> 00:36:25.355
involved in professions like the
law and medicine and the

00:36:25.355 --> 00:36:28.670
offering of services of other
kinds: surveyors,

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:32.139
clerks, land agents and so
forth.

00:36:32.139 --> 00:36:36.650
So, it all depends on how one
looks at it.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:40.949
You can focus your attention
upon the real polarization;

00:36:40.949 --> 00:36:44.331
you can also take account of
these middling groups who are

00:36:44.331 --> 00:36:45.460
doing quite well.
 

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:48.320
But, whichever way one looks at
it,

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.577
it's clear that the old
medieval conception of a

00:36:51.577 --> 00:36:54.621
society,
simply describable in terms of

00:36:54.621 --> 00:36:58.260
three estates,
had gradually decomposed under

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:01.889
the pressure of economic and
social change,

00:37:01.889 --> 00:37:05.489
and society was gradually
recomposing itself;

00:37:05.489 --> 00:37:11.487
adopting a new shape under the
pressure of various economic

00:37:11.487 --> 00:37:13.349
fields of force.
 

00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:18.871
And that transition involved
not only shifts in the structure

00:37:18.871 --> 00:37:24.670
of society, but also shifts in
peoples' attitudes and values.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:28.621
By the early seventeenth
century, decades of cumulative

00:37:28.621 --> 00:37:33.231
economic and social change meant
that economic relationships and

00:37:33.231 --> 00:37:37.181
forms of behavior which had
previously appeared new and

00:37:37.181 --> 00:37:41.280
rather threatening were becoming
more normalized,

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.159
more taken for granted.
 

00:37:44.159 --> 00:37:47.871
And some traditional values
were losing some of their older

00:37:47.871 --> 00:37:51.199
moral force and you can see that
in various ways,

00:37:51.199 --> 00:37:54.887
but a good example is to look
very briefly at the problem of

00:37:54.887 --> 00:37:58.465
enclosure,
the classic issue of great

00:37:58.465 --> 00:38:03.039
symbolic significance in
agrarian society.

00:38:03.039 --> 00:38:04.829
As you know,
in the mid-sixteenth century,

00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:08.862
enclosure had been demonized as
something which was damaging to

00:38:08.862 --> 00:38:13.425
the well-being of the ploughman,
to the strength of the nation,

00:38:13.425 --> 00:38:17.309
destructive of households and
of the Commonwealth.

00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:19.510
And throughout the later
sixteenth and early seventeenth

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:22.106
centuries,
actual enclosure schemes were

00:38:22.106 --> 00:38:26.405
very often opposed by coalitions
of tenants and commoners who

00:38:26.405 --> 00:38:30.846
tried to defend their customary
ways against the initiatives of

00:38:30.846 --> 00:38:34.847
landlords and others,
and we look at that again when

00:38:34.847 --> 00:38:36.710
I look at popular protest.
 

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:40.054
But, meanwhile,
the debate over enclosure was

00:38:40.054 --> 00:38:41.650
gradually shifting.
 

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.090
You get that shift reflected in
Parliament.

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:48.248
In 1601 there was a debate on
the enclosure laws and whether

00:38:48.248 --> 00:38:49.940
or not to repeal them.
 

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:52.789
Sir Robert Cecil,
son of William Cecil,

00:38:52.789 --> 00:38:56.998
Elizabeth's chief minister,
speaking on behalf of the privy

00:38:56.998 --> 00:38:59.972
council said,
"I think that whosoever

00:38:59.972 --> 00:39:03.579
doth not maintain the plough,
destroyeth this kingdom.;"

00:39:03.579 --> 00:39:06.050
very much the traditional
attitude towards enclosure.

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:08.179
He was opposed by Sir Walter
Raleigh,

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:09.989
yes, the Sir Walter
Raleigh,

00:39:09.989 --> 00:39:17.277
who said he agreed that there
was a situation which must be

00:39:17.277 --> 00:39:22.179
faced regarding agricultural
change,

00:39:22.179 --> 00:39:25.184
but he argued that there were
lots of countries in Europe

00:39:25.184 --> 00:39:28.349
which could produce corn cheaper
than England could and,

00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:31.963
therefore, it should be
imported rather than insisting

00:39:31.963 --> 00:39:34.760
upon maintaining land under the
plough.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:38.375
He argued that every man should
use his land to its best

00:39:38.375 --> 00:39:41.400
advantage and should be at
liberty to do so.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.536
"Leave every man
free," he said,

00:39:43.536 --> 00:39:45.309
to pursue his economic
interest.

00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:50.030
So we have the voice of
economic individualism opposing

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:50.730
Cecil.
 

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:54.039
Debates like that in Parliament
reveal a gradual process of

00:39:54.039 --> 00:39:58.092
transition in attitudes,
tensions and shifts between

00:39:58.092 --> 00:40:03.052
older and newer attitudes,
and that tension was resolved

00:40:03.052 --> 00:40:06.460
in various ways:
sometimes by authoritative

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:09.391
adjudication,
by government decisions in

00:40:09.391 --> 00:40:13.677
Parliament or the privy council;
often by sheer expediency,

00:40:13.677 --> 00:40:18.581
by people gradually adjusting
themselves, voluntarily or

00:40:18.581 --> 00:40:23.130
reluctantly, to the demands of a
changing world.

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:26.393
In the case of enclosure,
gradually most of the gentry

00:40:26.393 --> 00:40:30.518
and many leading tenant farmers
came to accept its desirability,

00:40:30.518 --> 00:40:35.619
and the laws against it were in
fact repealed in 1624,

00:40:35.619 --> 00:40:38.940
leaving people free to use
their land as they saw best,

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:43.159
as Raleigh had argued.
 

00:40:43.159 --> 00:40:48.358
Well, the attempts to stabilize
and channel change by the use of

00:40:48.358 --> 00:40:53.393
the law gave way gradually to
attempts simply to alleviate the

00:40:53.393 --> 00:40:58.509
worst manifestations of change
where it had led to major social

00:40:58.509 --> 00:41:02.159
distress,
and the greatest monument to

00:41:02.159 --> 00:41:05.570
efforts of that kind were the
Poor Laws.

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:09.606
The crisis years of the 1590s
led to the overhaul and

00:41:09.606 --> 00:41:14.266
consolidation and extension by
Parliament of earlier measures

00:41:14.266 --> 00:41:17.449
which had been taken in poor
relief,

00:41:17.449 --> 00:41:24.159
resulting in great consolidated
statutes of 1598 and 1601.

00:41:24.159 --> 00:41:28.451
Under those statues,
a full national system of poor

00:41:28.451 --> 00:41:32.333
relief was created,
based upon compulsory local

00:41:32.333 --> 00:41:35.139
taxation at the level of the
parish,

00:41:35.139 --> 00:41:40.510
administered by officers to be
appointed in every parish.

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:44.286
Under the laws,
vagrants were to be punished

00:41:44.286 --> 00:41:46.860
and restrained;
those who were deemed the

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.405
"impotent poor"--
the aged, the sick,

00:41:49.405 --> 00:41:53.130
the orphaned--were to be
relieved by being paid weekly

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:55.795
pensions in their parishes;
and finally,

00:41:55.795 --> 00:41:59.014
the "laboring poor"--
those who could get by most of

00:41:59.014 --> 00:42:01.329
the time but needed occasional
relief--

00:42:01.329 --> 00:42:04.853
were to be periodically
relieved by the parish to enable

00:42:04.853 --> 00:42:07.929
their families to get through
hard times and,

00:42:07.929 --> 00:42:12.088
where possible,
work was to be created for

00:42:12.088 --> 00:42:12.800
them.
 

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:18.315
So what you have in the Poor
Laws is a mixture of charity and

00:42:18.315 --> 00:42:19.510
discipline.
 

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:22.329
In some ways,
the system was quite well

00:42:22.329 --> 00:42:26.262
devised to deal with the
periodic life-cycle crises of

00:42:26.262 --> 00:42:30.268
the laboring population,
though rarely generously.

00:42:30.268 --> 00:42:34.704
It was a system which in many
ways demonstrated England's

00:42:34.704 --> 00:42:36.130
relative wealth.
 

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:38.610
There was a tax base there to
pay for it.

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:41.152
But it was one,
of course, which also

00:42:41.152 --> 00:42:45.179
demonstrated how unequally
distributed that wealth was.

00:42:45.179 --> 00:42:46.639
In one parish,
for example,

00:42:46.639 --> 00:42:48.659
the parish of Cawston in
Norfolk,

00:42:48.659 --> 00:42:51.960
where the laws were put into
operation very early,

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:56.057
there were sixty-eight people
in the parish out of one hundred

00:42:56.057 --> 00:42:59.954
and sixty households who were
able to pay the poor rates to

00:42:59.954 --> 00:43:01.500
support the system.
 

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:05.963
At the other end of the scale
there were twenty households who

00:43:05.963 --> 00:43:07.940
received weekly pensions.
 

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.889
So, sixty-eight are paying,
twenty are receiving pensions,

00:43:10.889 --> 00:43:14.309
all the ones in between are
neither paying nor in receipt of

00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:17.766
relief,
though in bad times some of

00:43:17.766 --> 00:43:22.670
those families might receive
occasional help.

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:27.606
So, the Poor Laws,
in a way, are both a response

00:43:27.606 --> 00:43:33.802
to and enshrine some of the
changes which had taken place in

00:43:33.802 --> 00:43:37.059
society at the local level.
 

00:43:37.059 --> 00:43:39.547
I've surveyed,
then, a process of

00:43:39.547 --> 00:43:44.369
redistribution of wealth in a
changing economic environment.

00:43:44.369 --> 00:43:47.139
Economic development had
enabled the population of

00:43:47.139 --> 00:43:50.802
England to grow faster,
for longer than was usually the

00:43:50.802 --> 00:43:54.130
case in other European countries
at this time.

00:43:54.130 --> 00:44:02.295
But the benefits of economic
growth were poorly distributed

00:44:02.295 --> 00:44:04.829
and that showed.
 

00:44:04.829 --> 00:44:09.034
Population, at last,
began to stabilize in the third

00:44:09.034 --> 00:44:13.567
decade of the seventeenth
century and that began to slow

00:44:13.567 --> 00:44:17.030
down this long-term process of
change.

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:19.730
The reasons for that
stabilization were,

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:23.268
partly, shifts in
mortality--the evidence is that

00:44:23.268 --> 00:44:27.326
life expectation at birth was
deteriorating in the early

00:44:27.326 --> 00:44:31.387
seventeenth century--
but it was restrained even more

00:44:31.387 --> 00:44:34.750
by shifts that were taking place
in fertility;

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:37.090
quite significant shifts.
 

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:40.952
In the early seventeenth
century, the rates of fertility

00:44:40.952 --> 00:44:45.096
that can be calculated from the
parish registers of parishes

00:44:45.096 --> 00:44:49.170
show that marital fertility was
falling quite sharply.

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:52.041
That was produced,
in part, by a rising age at

00:44:52.041 --> 00:44:56.190
marriage, people were marrying
later and having fewer children.

00:44:56.190 --> 00:45:01.014
But it was also produced by a
larger proportion of the

00:45:01.014 --> 00:45:04.199
population never marrying at
all.

00:45:04.199 --> 00:45:07.157
It was startling when
historical demographers

00:45:07.157 --> 00:45:10.519
discovered that of the people
who were coming up to

00:45:10.519 --> 00:45:14.773
marriageable age,
from the 1620s through to the

00:45:14.773 --> 00:45:18.307
1650s,
people who'd been born around

00:45:18.307 --> 00:45:21.152
1600 to 1610,
or thereabouts,

00:45:21.152 --> 00:45:26.313
as many as twenty percent,
or sometimes even more,

00:45:26.313 --> 00:45:27.960
never married.
 

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.889
It's a quite extraordinary
figure;

00:45:29.889 --> 00:45:34.380
a very large proportion of the
population remaining unmarried.

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:37.936
What we seem to have here is
evidence of a situation in

00:45:37.936 --> 00:45:40.960
which,
for those who were doing least

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:44.199
well in the circumstances of the
time,

00:45:44.199 --> 00:45:47.940
life was too insecure,
or living standards were too

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.954
marginal,
for them to be able to marry

00:45:50.954 --> 00:45:54.809
and establish independent
households of their own.

00:45:54.809 --> 00:46:01.329
As a result, fertility declined;
population gradually stabilized.

00:46:01.329 --> 00:46:06.659
As population stabilized,
so did prices.

00:46:06.659 --> 00:46:12.813
The great underlying dynamic of
change from the second quarter

00:46:12.813 --> 00:46:19.068
of the sixteenth century through
to the mid-seventeenth century

00:46:19.068 --> 00:46:20.380
was over.
 

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.659
But that long dynamic of
population growth,

00:46:22.659 --> 00:46:26.554
inflation and its many
consequences in economy and

00:46:26.554 --> 00:46:30.085
society,
had unleashed economic changes

00:46:30.085 --> 00:46:34.779
which would not be reversed and
they had significantly

00:46:34.779 --> 00:46:39.826
reconfigured the structure of
society and the relationship

00:46:39.826 --> 00:46:42.039
between its members.
 

00:46:42.039 --> 00:46:45.351
So, with that,
I've tried to briefly set the

00:46:45.351 --> 00:46:48.847
scene for you,
and now we can go on to look at

00:46:48.847 --> 00:46:52.449
a number of other aspects of
society and culture,

00:46:52.449 --> 00:46:58.422
starting next week with the
issues of witchcraft and popular

00:46:58.422 --> 00:47:00.550
literacy and crime.
 

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:06.000

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.470
- So today we're gonna talk
about what I advertised

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.600
on last Thursday as the backstory behind

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.540
the South African transition.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.159
Or at least part of the
backstory that involved business.

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:23.340
And this is the first of
several classes in the second

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.350
half of the course where
we gonna turn the lights

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.970
up on business.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.370
We talked a lot about the
declining fortunes of labor

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.880
in this course, and how
that's played out in politics.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.020
But we haven't spent
much time on business,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.480
just generally treating as a black box.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.610
Obviously the power,
relative power of business

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.040
has increased in the capitalist

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.340
world since the collapse of communism.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.320
And that's brought new dynamics.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.640
It also, as a normative
matter tends when capitalism

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.500
is the only game in town,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.750
it tends to make the old
Marxist critiques of capitalism

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.160
a little beside the point.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.210
The more interesting questions
about business and capital

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.240
are what are the conditions
under which they play

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.540
a progressive role in politics?

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.740
What are the conditions under
which they play a predatory

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.580
role in politics?

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.580
And how might they be shifted
from a less predatory role,

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.300
of the sort we saw in
Russia in particular?

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.676
How might business be induced to play

00:01:29.676 --> 00:01:33.680
more constructive roles in politics?

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.773
Even in very difficult politics.

00:01:36.773 --> 00:01:39.750
So that's one theme that's
gonna come back several times

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.323
in the latter part of the course.

00:01:43.323 --> 00:01:46.763
But let's begin by going back
to Johannesburg in the 1990s.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.350
- [Tertius] All of a sudden,
I saw the security people

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.343
running out.

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:56.029
And I said, "what's up?"

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:58.879
And I said, "they've broken
through, and they're coming."

00:01:59.732 --> 00:02:01.610
(chanting)

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.326
And my own security man simply
grabbed hold of me and ran.

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:08.576
(chanting)

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.220
- [Cyril] Pandemonium just broke out

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.998
in the entire building.

00:02:16.998 --> 00:02:20.090
Many people on the ANC side,
from the government side,

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.346
all huddled into the government offices.

00:02:24.346 --> 00:02:27.560
We thought that the
right-wingers would never dare

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.570
this much into government offices,

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.000
and start accosting
people, or assaulting them.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.673
And in fact, we even feared
that we would be shot at.

00:02:38.673 --> 00:02:40.118
(yelling)

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:42.230
- [Narrator] The AWB overwhelmed
the police who retreated

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.662
before them.

00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:44.495
(yelling)

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:45.400
- [Mac] Signs of glass,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.340
and everything chattering, and everything.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.173
And reports coming through
that they are looking for us.

00:02:52.215 --> 00:02:53.520
Particularly -------

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.680
- [Narrator] Terrified
delegates barricaded

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.670
themselves in their offices.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.750
(chanting)

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.640
In the conference chamber, the AWB chanted

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.299
and dubbed slogans demanding
a separate white state.

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:06.750
(yelling)

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.730
Soon after the invasion,
the negotiators agreed that

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.100
an election should be
held the following April.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.606
- I have the demands up here.

00:03:14.606 --> 00:03:17.200
- [Narrator] With the
ANC growing in confidence

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.560
and looking certain to win the election,

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.680
the national party had
retreated bit by bit

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.100
on nearly all its power sharing demands.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.220
As the conference wound
up the ANC triumphant,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.490
Ramaphosa celebrated his 41st birthday .

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.797
- I was able to see Roelf Meyer
for the first time dancing

00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:39.170
on the floor where we
were having this party.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.900
He was quite happy, he was quite jovial.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.469
And I kept wondering
whether I would have been

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:49.900
as happy as he was if
I was in his position,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.900
having finally given in
in the way that they had.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.090
- [Narrator] Key national
party negotiators were

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.570
satisfied they'd struck
a workable deal with

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.160
an adversary they had grown to trust.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.445
Now the election could proceed.

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.880
(cheering)

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.130
Terre'Blanche threw all his

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.280
weight into stopping the election.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.550
He summoned a rally at
the Pretoria Monument

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.490
to the Africana pioneers.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.645
He said if Mandela wanted
war, he would get war.

00:04:18.645 --> 00:04:21.030
(yelling)

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.280
(drumming)

00:04:25.993 --> 00:04:28.180
Terre'Blanche then persuaded
the folks to boycott

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.383
and oppose election.

00:04:31.142 --> 00:04:35.225
- [Terra] (in foreign language).

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.290
(cheering)

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.267
(in foreign language)

00:04:42.267 --> 00:04:44.504
(cheering)

00:04:44.504 --> 00:04:47.671
(in foreign language)

00:05:10.263 --> 00:05:14.140
- Pretty frightening
stuff you might think.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.388
And the reason I put it up
there is just to emphasize

00:05:18.388 --> 00:05:23.388
that when Mandela and de Klerk
negotiated their agreement,

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.960
that was not the end of the matter,

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.960
it was to quote trachelism; it
was the end of the beginning.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.110
And there was a lot that had
to happen for the transition

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.000
to actually to be consummated.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.710
And it was enormously fragile.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.060
And I am just gonna walk you
though a bit of a timeline

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.340
to give you a sense of how fragile it was.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.293
We saw last Thursday that on
the 2nd of February, 1990,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.110
the government announced
it was unilaterally freeing

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.570
all political prisoners, and
banning all organizations,

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.930
and planning to negotiate with the ANC.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.650
Three months later, the ANC
unilaterally suspended its

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.986
armed struggle, and began
serious negotiations.

00:06:14.986 --> 00:06:19.940
That led in December 1991,
and then May of 1992,

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.983
to two rounds of round-table negotiations,

00:06:24.983 --> 00:06:26.659
the so-called CODESA;

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:29.920
Conscience on a Democratic
South African negotiations,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.350
where all of the stakeholders,
there were 19 stakeholders

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.800
initially, all the political parties,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.994
all social movements
had a seat at the table

00:06:38.994 --> 00:06:43.690
as a way of trying to
negotiate the transition

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.340
to democracy.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.810
As I said to you in the last lecture,

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.762
democratic path to democracy
is difficult because

00:06:52.762 --> 00:06:57.080
democratic political
orders are public good,

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.650
and it's very difficult
to do that to provide them

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.133
democratically.

00:07:03.133 --> 00:07:05.960
And indeed, there were
people and groups that didn't

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.430
want to see this transition;

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.700
the far-right we've talked about.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.500
And we'll see it in other
groups were not so interested

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.850
in seeing this transition
to a unified democratic

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:18.700
South Africa.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.560
So they became spoilers and
they perpetually interrupted

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.703
the negotiations,
stone-walled the settlement.

00:07:26.703 --> 00:07:31.480
And in May of 1992, they
were sort of reconstituted

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.603
having been floundering
since previous year.

00:07:37.218 --> 00:07:40.130
But a month later, there
was a massacre at a place

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:45.130
called Boipatong, which where
about 45 people were shot

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.360
dead apparently, allegedly,
by Zulu supporters

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.196
of the Inkatha Freedom Party,

00:07:54.196 --> 00:07:56.740
an ethnic separatist party that I'll tell

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.540
you more about shortly.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.500
But it was widely believed
that the South African

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.830
security police were
behind the seeds involved

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.380
in the Boipatong Massacre.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.685
The result was CODESA collapsed,

00:08:11.685 --> 00:08:15.683
and the violence escalated dramatically.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.366
So dramatically, that the
ANC and the government

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:21.860
started having secret talks.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.913
But they weren't really secret;

00:08:23.913 --> 00:08:25.532
everybody knew they were going on.

00:08:25.532 --> 00:08:27.850
I was in South Africa that year
and everyday on the evening

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.120
news, there would be
reports of what had gone on

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.120
in the secret talks between
the ANC and the government.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:39.360
And eventually, they signed a deal;

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.110
an elite pact, if you like,
in September that was called

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:47.540
a Record of Understanding
about how things would move

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.130
forward.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.570
This then led them to
create something called

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:54.620
a Multiparty Negotiating Forum.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.540
And in the Multiparty Negotiating Forum,

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.120
basically the ANC and
government told the other

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.380
players what was going
to happen to give them

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.390
time to accommodate themselves and adjust.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:12.600
But they did not really treat
it anymore as multiparty

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.710
negotiation as far as the
government and the ANC

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:16.943
was concerned.

00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:22.130
It was a done deal, and people
had to get with the program

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.323
so to speak, or be left behind.

00:09:27.809 --> 00:09:31.937
Later in that same month,
a young, charismatic ANC

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.680
member, very much on the
radical flank of the ANC,

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.600
was assassinated; Chris Hani.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.120
Very extremely charismatic,
also in the communist party.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:50.120
And the result of this, he
was assassinated by a right,

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.923
I think it was Polish
extraction white South African.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.380
And the whole country seemed

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.363
to be on the verge of exploding.

00:10:02.391 --> 00:10:04.743
The violence escalated hugely.

00:10:07.087 --> 00:10:11.140
And the talks were in danger
again of falling apart.

00:10:13.494 --> 00:10:14.710
And I put up on the slide there

00:10:15.852 --> 00:10:17.223
that the election date was set.

00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:21.310
And the reason for that was
that Mandela and Ramaphosa

00:10:22.936 --> 00:10:26.780
came to declare conventionally
and said that the only

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.103
way they could temp down the violence,

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.630
was if it was a non-negotiable
agreed that the election

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:39.240
would take place within a
year of Chris Hani's death.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.110
So that the election had
to be held in April of 1994

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.110
became a hard deadline, if you like,

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.700
a non-negotiable item,

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.633
and that turned out to be important later.

00:10:52.495 --> 00:10:57.495
Realizing that they had
been handed a fait accompli,

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.283
Buthelezi who was the head of
this Inkatha Freedom Party,

00:11:04.849 --> 00:11:09.093
walked out of the talks.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.310
And essentially the
Multiparty Negotiating Forum

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:14.993
collapsed at that point.

00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:19.050
And true to the divided dollar
story we've been talking

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.660
about earlier in the course,

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.170
even though he was a leader
of an ethnic Zulu party,

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:29.812
he joined forces with the
right-wing Africans Whites.

00:11:29.812 --> 00:11:34.812
And also the heads of the
traditional homelands,

00:11:36.073 --> 00:11:37.080
so the Bantustans,

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.630
who saw themselves as losing
their power in the new

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.270
South Africa, and they
announced that they were gonna

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.133
be boycotting the elections.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.230
And that was important
because most people who know

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.140
a little bit about the
South African conflict,

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.230
know the story behind this pie chart.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.963
That as you can see,

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.470
the Black African majority
of the country was 79%,

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:05.230
the Whites were fewer than 10%,

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:10.230
and the rest were mixed-race,
or Indians and Asian groups.

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.440
What is less well-known outside

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.390
of the South African context,

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:19.320
is the ethnic breakdown of
the non-White population.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.320
And there you can see that
Zulu were a plurality of a 28%,

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.893
but the next race group,
almost 20% were the Xhosa.

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:35.850
And why this matters is that
the Xhosa were more or less

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.663
a 100% committed to the ANC.

00:12:40.632 --> 00:12:45.632
The ANC probably won, not 100%,
but over 90% of their vote.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:51.940
But the Zulu were deeply
divided nationally between

00:12:53.233 --> 00:12:54.700
the ANC and Inkatha,

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.630
but in the Eastern part of the country,

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.170
which was then called Natal,

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:01.453
today is called KwaZulu-Natal,

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:07.180
they controlled the
majority of the Zulu vote,

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.423
the Inkatha Freedom Party.

00:13:11.296 --> 00:13:13.196
And so from Buthelezi's point of view,

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.750
a much better outcome
would've been a partition

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.853
at the end of the day of some sort,

00:13:19.755 --> 00:13:22.320
where Inkatha could be in a majority,

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:27.320
and so actually control
what is today KwaZulu-Natal.

00:13:28.634 --> 00:13:31.120
So he didn't really want
a transition to a country

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.150
in which all the polls
told them that they ANC

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:38.673
would win a two-thirds
overall national majority.

00:13:40.416 --> 00:13:42.840
And so, Buthelezi here was not just,

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.890
even though we talk about the deal between

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.910
the ANC and the government,

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:52.470
Buthelezi was the potential
spoiler of this settlement.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.731
And why did this matter?

00:13:54.731 --> 00:13:58.590
It mattered because the civil war in Natal

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.770
would have made the transition impossible.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:07.440
The levels of violence
by 1992 in KwaZulu-Natal,

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.290
had already reached civil war proportions.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.180
And the notion that the
country could really have

00:14:15.374 --> 00:14:18.770
a successful election, which
was boycotted by Inkatha,

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.573
was not credible.

00:14:22.517 --> 00:14:25.003
And so, it was a huge
problem going forward.

00:14:25.905 --> 00:14:27.655
So just going back to the timeline.

00:14:29.348 --> 00:14:34.348
In June 1993, one of the far
right-wing groups torpedoed

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.450
the negotiations yet again,

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.102
similar to the clip I showed you,

00:14:41.102 --> 00:14:43.503
but a different meeting in Kempton Park,

00:14:44.735 --> 00:14:45.910
they just drove armed vehicles

00:14:46.786 --> 00:14:50.240
through the plate glass
windows and constantly

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.163
were trying to upset and
harass the negotiators.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:59.070
All of the time this
election that had to occur

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:04.070
in April of 1994, lest the
deal between the government

00:15:04.526 --> 00:15:07.503
and the ANC come unstuck, was approaching.

00:15:08.688 --> 00:15:11.770
And indeed, a month before
the election, in March,

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.940
it all came to a head
in one of the homelands.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:19.590
The homelands had been
sometimes called Bantustans,

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:23.910
as I said, these were the
nominally independent states

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.780
under apartheid migrant labor system.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.530
Violence exploded when
the leader of one of these

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.120
said he was not participating
in the election.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.820
And some of the right-wing
Africanas went ostensibly

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:42.560
to support him in the hope
that this would precipitate

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.800
a military coup;

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:48.202
that the military would get behind,

00:15:48.202 --> 00:15:52.713
would get behind the
uprising in Bophuthatswana,

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:55.710
and there would be a takeover,

00:15:55.710 --> 00:16:00.710
and the impending election
would be stamped out.

00:16:03.199 --> 00:16:05.960
And so, there were these people
went there in power model

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.940
uniforms, lot of people were killed,

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.800
including four white Africanas were killed

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.410
and it was filmed on national television

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.883
and shown over and over again.

00:16:18.854 --> 00:16:21.292
And it really seemed,
this now we're a month

00:16:21.292 --> 00:16:22.675
before the election,

00:16:22.675 --> 00:16:25.020
it seemed like the whole
world was going up in smoke.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.350
If you think about April 1994,

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:32.053
those of you who are
old enough to remember,

00:16:32.903 --> 00:16:37.570
this is when the Rewandan
genocide was in full swing

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:38.933
to the North.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.930
These were the kinds of
pictures that South Africans

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:47.063
were seeing on television and
in the newspapers every night.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.920
And so the idea that you
could have some horrific

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:58.280
bloodbath, it wasn't an academic thought,

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.870
you know, we're seeing it every
night on the evening news.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.400
And just literally weeks
before the election;

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.210
three weeks before the election.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.500
This is what was
happening in Johannesburg.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.790
- [Narrator] Johannesburg,
the commercial heart

00:17:12.182 --> 00:17:14.532
of South Africa paralyzed
by gunfire, and fear.

00:17:16.257 --> 00:17:17.911
(explosions)

00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:20.110
Chaos erupted on the
streets as thousands of Zulu

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:23.210
supporter of the Inkatha
Freedom Party protested

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.523
against the election.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.600
The rattle of AK-47s
echoed around the banks

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.850
of the business district.

00:17:32.118 --> 00:17:33.133
(gun shots firing)

00:17:33.133 --> 00:17:34.952
As security forces tried to keep control.

00:17:34.952 --> 00:17:37.160
(explosions)

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.450
Tear gas and stun grenades filled

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.463
the normally quite squares.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.490
There were running gun battles
as police tried to force

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:48.528
back gun-wielding demonstrators
using rubber bullets

00:17:48.528 --> 00:17:49.823
and buckshot.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.750
At least eight people were
killed by African National

00:17:54.597 --> 00:17:57.660
Congress guards when the
Inkatha crowds reportedly tried

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.699
to attack the ANC headquarters.

00:18:00.699 --> 00:18:02.470
(explosions)

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.990
Bodies littered the streets
as mayhem brought central

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:08.063
Johannesburg to a standstill.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.648
- So it didn't look like
we were three weeks from

00:18:12.648 --> 00:18:16.466
a democratic national election.

00:18:16.466 --> 00:18:18.943
And at that point, Henry Kissinger,

00:18:20.097 --> 00:18:22.211
and Lord Carrington of Briton,

00:18:22.211 --> 00:18:24.100
were brought in to try
and mediate a solution.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.700
They spent all of two
and a half days there,

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.010
concluded the situation was hopeless,

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:30.814
packed up, and left.

00:18:30.814 --> 00:18:35.814
And so then again, the
newspapers were just full

00:18:37.517 --> 00:18:39.547
of poor taint of failures.

00:18:39.547 --> 00:18:42.620
This is an article which you
can peruse at your leisure.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:46.470
But basically detailing the
way in which Zulu militias

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:50.715
were preparing to escalate the civil war.

00:18:50.715 --> 00:18:53.690
And then, miraculously, we
turn on the evening news

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:54.890
ad this is what we hear.

00:18:57.274 --> 00:18:59.560
- In South Africa, a
breakthrough may be imminent

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.890
to stem recent political violence.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.710
Political leaders appear
to have found a way to end

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:08.390
the standoff over the country's
first all-race elections.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.690
Another meeting is set for
Tuesday to finalize the deal.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.873
CNN's Pete Arnet reports.

00:19:16.329 --> 00:19:19.180
- [Pete] Following six
hours of talk in Pretoria

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.940
aimed at ending a major political
standoff in South Africa,

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.870
the official line was guidedly optimistic.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.493
- Our talks today are going very well.

00:19:29.116 --> 00:19:31.660
- [Pete] So well, in fact,
that sources tell CNN

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.450
that details of a plan to bring
the Zulus into the election

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:38.150
had been okayed by
negotiators for the government

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:40.270
and for the Zulu chief.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.150
And a document has been
drawn up that must now only

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:46.483
be approved by ANC leader Nelson Mandela.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:52.550
- And Mandela did approve
the document and the election

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:53.733
went forward,

00:19:55.799 --> 00:20:00.799
and Ikatha did indeed
not boycott the election,

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:05.800
and it occurred as planned
on the 27th of April, 1994.

00:20:08.084 --> 00:20:12.730
The ANC won almost more
than 62.5% of the vote.

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.794
The National Party came in second,

00:20:15.794 --> 00:20:19.510
and Inkatha came in
with 10.5% of the vote,

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:24.450
and enough votes to get
control of the regional

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.830
legislature in the new KwaZulu-Natal,

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:31.500
as well as three seats in the cabinet.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:36.500
And so, that's the timeline
up through the election.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.830
Today's agenda is to talk about
business and the back story.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:45.460
You could see just from
what I went through,

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.872
there were many points at which

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:49.322
this might have fallen apart.

00:20:50.171 --> 00:20:52.921
And business had a great deal
to do with why it didn't.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:55.930
And in the course of considering

00:20:57.274 --> 00:20:58.610
the role of business in this transition,

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:03.610
we're going to revisit some
of our earlier, briefer,

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:07.680
glancing visits with modernization theory,

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.560
and look at what we should
think about businesses'

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:16.040
attitudes toward authoritarian
and democratic systems.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:21.040
And then we'll also, part of
our theme is to think about

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.540
the role not only that business
played during this crisis,

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:30.540
but also before and after to
get a more panoramic historical

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.280
sense.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:37.280
So, just to be clear
as to what I am saying,

00:21:37.592 --> 00:21:38.710
and what I am not saying.

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:43.040
I am not arguing, and it
wouldn't be plausible to argue

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.250
that business caused the
transition from apartheid

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:47.673
in South Africa.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:52.275
Apartheid was caused by many things,

00:21:52.275 --> 00:21:55.360
not least the negotiations
we talked about last time

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.423
between leaders,

00:21:57.366 --> 00:22:00.060
and not least the activities
of the liberation movement.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:04.080
Business, however, did have
a great deal to do with

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.760
the fact that the transition was peaceful,

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.690
substantially peaceful,

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:12.610
and that it ended up in a democracy.

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:17.390
That is to say it is clear
that apartheid's days

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:19.190
were numbered.

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:22.707
The status quo as it
existed in South Africa

00:22:22.707 --> 00:22:25.700
in the 1980s was not going to survive.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:29.700
But that didn't mean you were
gonna end up with a democracy.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.781
There could've been a military coup,

00:22:32.781 --> 00:22:34.800
there could've been an ongoing civil war,

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.098
there could've been
multiple other outcomes.

00:22:38.098 --> 00:22:40.705
There could've just been
a massive crack down

00:22:40.705 --> 00:22:42.980
of an apartheid authoritarian state.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.350
But so the role that business played

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:50.920
was in facilitating a peaceful
transition to a democracy,

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.253
rather than some other
more bloody denouement.

00:22:55.804 --> 00:22:58.658
And I am gonna focus on
four areas where business

00:22:58.658 --> 00:23:00.239
had an impact.

00:23:00.239 --> 00:23:02.230
The first is in getting
negotiations started

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.660
in the first place.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:08.521
By the time Mandela in the
late 1980s was secretly talking

00:23:08.521 --> 00:23:12.851
to de Klerk in messages,

00:23:12.851 --> 00:23:15.591
various things had been actually

00:23:15.591 --> 00:23:20.040
been going on for some time
that made it propitious

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.583
for those talks to begin.

00:23:23.559 --> 00:23:25.713
And I'll say something about that,

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.840
then I am going to talk
about the role business

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.430
played in actually brokering the deals

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:34.860
between the government
and the ANC initially,

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.610
and then between the
two of them and Inkartha

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:39.973
toward the end.

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:43.980
I am going to talk about
the role business played

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.460
in managing potential spoilers.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.600
When I put that stylized
diagram up of transition

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.840
negotiations last time,

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:56.516
I mentioned that the people on the flanks

00:23:56.516 --> 00:23:59.920
of the government and the opposition,

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.343
potential spoilers,

00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:05.340
and had to be convinced,
co-opted, or marginalized

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.863
if the transition is not to be scuttled.

00:24:09.863 --> 00:24:11.959
And business played a role in that.

00:24:11.959 --> 00:24:13.780
And I also mentioned
that it's very important

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:17.220
in the conversations about
from above and from below

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.810
to build support for the new dispensation,

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:23.700
which does not have a
constituency in the old order,

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.800
because it's a deeply polarized situation.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.603
So those will be the four
areas that we'll focus on.

00:24:34.913 --> 00:24:36.830
Now, let's go back to the 1970s,

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:38.357
this is the, you know,

00:24:39.475 --> 00:24:41.675
national party had come to power in 1948,

00:24:41.675 --> 00:24:45.540
it had spend much of the
1960s creating the apartheid

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:49.790
order with compulsory segregation,

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:54.440
forcing force removals of
Africans from the cities

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.590
into these homelands,

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:59.360
where they then worked
as migrant laborers.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:04.360
And by the 1970s, it
was firmly established

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:08.320
that the government had
been in power fore more

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.293
than a decade,

00:25:11.101 --> 00:25:13.137
there was no meaningful
white opposition party,

00:25:13.137 --> 00:25:14.870
and they seemed to be entrenched.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:17.150
In a setting like that,

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:22.150
why might business decide
that it should start

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:25.781
talking to the leadership
of the liberation movement?

00:25:25.781 --> 00:25:28.170
Liberation movement was illegal,

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:29.530
it was underground,

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:34.420
after 1963 many of them including Mandela

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:36.700
were imprisoned, and Jacob Zuma.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:40.950
Others were like Mbeki,
were in exile in London,

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:44.750
or elsewhere in Eastern Europe.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.580
Why would business leaders,

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.050
now I am talking about big business,

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:50.733
white big business.

00:25:51.605 --> 00:25:56.605
Why would they wanna start
talking to the leadership

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:59.963
of the liberation movement?

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:02.673
Yeah.

00:26:08.771 --> 00:26:10.551
- [Student] Thinking
about, like, business.

00:26:10.551 --> 00:26:11.468
- Speak up.

00:26:15.108 --> 00:26:16.507
(tapping on microphone)

00:26:16.507 --> 00:26:17.580
- [Student] Hi.

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:18.868
No?

00:26:18.868 --> 00:26:19.999
- Or just yell.

00:26:19.999 --> 00:26:21.250
(laughter)

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:22.570
- [Student] From a business perspective,

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:25.706
80% of the population,
if you empower them,

00:26:25.706 --> 00:26:28.570
80% of the population
have to be democracy.

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:31.280
- Okay, so business might
have a bigger market

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.700
if they could do better business.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:39.700
And it was certainly a view
that apartheid was produced

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:43.274
inefficient labor markets, and so on.

00:26:43.274 --> 00:26:44.850
We'll come back to that.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:48.470
But we should notice
this is quite unusual.

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:51.240
Typically in authoritarian systems,

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.070
business does not get
involved in politics.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:57.183
If we look at China, business,

00:26:58.153 --> 00:27:00.964
when we talked about the rule
of law in China and so on,

00:27:00.964 --> 00:27:03.290
business might go to court
over business issues,

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:07.010
but typically they keep
their heads low in politics

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:08.890
in authoritarian systems.

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.403
You know, they may be
interested in the market,

00:27:12.249 --> 00:27:14.802
but that doesn't mean you
have to have a democracy

00:27:14.802 --> 00:27:16.960
to sell in the South African market.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.040
And indeed, Carles Boix, who
I put up on an earlier slide

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.623
where we were talking
about modernization theory.

00:27:24.473 --> 00:27:26.190
His argument about,

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:29.315
his modern version of
modernization theory,

00:27:29.315 --> 00:27:33.134
if you go back and look at that slide,

00:27:33.134 --> 00:27:35.886
you'll see I had him on
the slide which said,

00:27:35.886 --> 00:27:39.845
"modernization comes as a
result of pressure from below."

00:27:39.845 --> 00:27:42.730
And so this might seem
inconsistent with what I am about

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:44.000
to say now, but it's not,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.170
because many people
have made this argument,

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.940
I am just giving him as an illustration,

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:55.040
is the thought was that in
an authoritarian setting

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.970
business is gonna resist democratization

00:27:58.878 --> 00:28:02.040
until they think that they're
pretty sure they can leave.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.393
It's a Hershman story.

00:28:05.538 --> 00:28:08.240
So, if I think I can't leave,

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.340
and I give every body the vote,

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:13.479
it's the, you know, the
median voter problem.

00:28:13.479 --> 00:28:14.312
They're gonna tax me,

00:28:14.312 --> 00:28:16.121
they're gonna expropriate my assets

00:28:16.121 --> 00:28:17.799
once they have the votes.

00:28:17.799 --> 00:28:20.630
So I have a strong incentive
to resist democratization.

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:24.597
But once I can, if I can
leave with my capital,

00:28:24.597 --> 00:28:27.740
and with my assets,
then the threat of exit,

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:31.660
my threat of exit makes
it less likely that

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:34.940
they will be willing to
risk the economy's future

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:36.580
by taxing me.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:40.520
So this variant of
modernization, as I said,

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:45.360
it assumes the pressure to
democratize is coming from below,

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.900
but the argument is
businesses can align up

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.210
with authoritarian systems
so long as there's what

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.920
economists refer to as
high asset specificity .

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.773
That is, you can't take it with you.

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:02.820
You know, if it's a world
revolving around human capital,

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:06.271
I can just walk out of the
door with my human capital

00:29:06.271 --> 00:29:09.583
in my cranium, and, you
know, set up shop elsewhere.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.901
But if what I own is a goldmine,

00:29:12.901 --> 00:29:14.060
I can't take the goldmine with me.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.714
Right?

00:29:15.714 --> 00:29:17.743
I can't take the diamond mines with me.

00:29:17.743 --> 00:29:18.817
Right?

00:29:18.817 --> 00:29:20.670
And so this is why it
seems counter-intuitive,

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:24.570
at least form the standpoint
of those traditional theories,

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:28.520
it seems counter-intuitive
that business would actually

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:33.520
favor an opening to the
liberation movement,

00:29:33.778 --> 00:29:35.760
because very high asset specificity,

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.780
there were big business
was invested in big mining,

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.650
and the diamond mining, and so on.

00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:44.840
They were also invested
elsewhere in the economy,

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:48.150
but they didn't have
much credible capacity

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:49.943
to threaten exit.

00:29:52.412 --> 00:29:54.490
And so that's initially a passall
and we'll come back to it.

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:58.220
But it means that there must
have been sticks and carrots.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:02.100
There must have been
sticks to make business

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.870
think that they needed to start talking,

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:06.370
and there must have also been

00:30:07.744 --> 00:30:08.870
carrots to make it look appealing.

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:11.163
And I wanna start with the sticks.

00:30:12.414 --> 00:30:15.334
Sticks matter because things,

00:30:15.334 --> 00:30:19.964
if people don't have to change,

00:30:19.964 --> 00:30:21.673
they're probably not gonna change,

00:30:21.673 --> 00:30:22.854
for the most part.

00:30:22.854 --> 00:30:25.195
Particularly, I said most
politicians are risk-averse,

00:30:25.195 --> 00:30:29.101
and most business people
are also risk-averse

00:30:29.101 --> 00:30:31.020
in that sense,

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.889
they might wanna take business risks,

00:30:32.889 --> 00:30:36.280
but they're not gonna
get involved in trying

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.150
to shape the political future unless

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:42.192
they start to feel that the status quo

00:30:42.192 --> 00:30:46.050
is as what an economist
would call a wasting asset.

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:50.460
That things are changing
in ways that are not likely

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.887
to be good for them.

00:30:52.887 --> 00:30:57.433
So, what could the sticks have been?

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.922
Yeah.

00:31:00.922 --> 00:31:03.010
- [Student 2] To avoid collapse.

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:03.843
- Sanctions.

00:31:03.843 --> 00:31:05.210
Okay, so sanctions,

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:07.874
the difficulty with sanctions,

00:31:07.874 --> 00:31:10.157
and this was the era of boycotts,

00:31:10.157 --> 00:31:10.990
disinvestment.

00:31:12.162 --> 00:31:15.283
David Swensen who's managed
the Yale endowment since

00:31:15.283 --> 00:31:20.283
1985 will tell you a story
if you have lunch with him.

00:31:20.588 --> 00:31:24.958
That he came to Yale
from Wall Street in 1985,

00:31:24.958 --> 00:31:26.410
and he went to the investment office,

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:29.570
and he found it occupied
by anti-apartheid student

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:32.957
demonstrators, and he said,
"right then I knew I left

00:31:32.957 --> 00:31:33.917
"Wall Street."

00:31:35.121 --> 00:31:36.436
(laugher)

00:31:36.436 --> 00:31:41.436
There were boycotts,
past over Reagan's veto,

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:46.360
the truth about sanctions is
that they don't work though.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.530
Industrial sanctions don't work,

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:50.320
and in South Africa they didn't work,

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.600
because, you know, Kodak
left, but AGFA came,

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.770
Ford left but Toyota came.

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:57.850
And indeed,

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:02.850
the sanctions led to
stimulation of the indigenous

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:07.170
capital markets in the growth
of the South African economy.

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:12.170
So, industrial sanctions didn't
really make any difference.

00:32:15.592 --> 00:32:17.980
I'll come back to financial
sanctions in a bit.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:22.980
But a principle stick
here was that South Africa

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:27.590
had illegal black trade unions.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:31.200
They had outlawed black
trade unions under apartheid.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.330
And this hadn't mattered
that much to business,

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:38.850
because there had been labor
quiescence through the 1970s,

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.000
as you can see from that slide.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.810
There'd been almost no industrial action.

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:48.193
In the early 1970s that starts to change,

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.959
and although it's child's play

00:32:51.959 --> 00:32:54.107
compared to what's coming later,

00:32:54.107 --> 00:32:55.322
as you can see,

00:32:55.322 --> 00:32:56.523
if you look at what happened in the 1980s,

00:32:57.787 --> 00:33:02.787
as compared with what they were used to,

00:33:02.852 --> 00:33:06.041
there were these big
outbreaks of wildcat strikes

00:33:06.041 --> 00:33:10.640
and the mine owners didn't
know who was running them,

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.223
and they wanted to be able
to negotiate with them.

00:33:14.141 --> 00:33:17.500
They wanted to be able to
negotiate industrial peace,

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.646
because they' were
trying to run the mines.

00:33:19.646 --> 00:33:20.553
So in the first instance,

00:33:21.387 --> 00:33:24.770
they wanted unions to be
legalized so that they could have

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:29.679
basically a corporatist
arranged where the management

00:33:29.679 --> 00:33:32.051
and labor could negotiate
industrial deals,

00:33:32.051 --> 00:33:34.201
and they could be
enforced by a government.

00:33:36.379 --> 00:33:39.200
The government was strongly
apposed to this for the obvious

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.510
reason that with all
political opposition illegal,

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:45.178
if you legalized unions,

00:33:45.178 --> 00:33:47.350
they would become magnets
for political activism.

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:49.727
The mine owners said, "yes, we know that,

00:33:49.727 --> 00:33:52.177
"but we should do this,
we have to do this.

00:33:52.177 --> 00:33:53.970
"We can't run the mines."

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:57.440
And there was something of
a standoff for several years

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:01.010
in the mid 1970s, but eventually,

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:04.883
the business leaders beat the
government into submission.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.680
And something called the
Wiehahn Commission was appointed

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.220
that was nominally gonna look at it,

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.805
but it was run by a man, Wiehahn,

00:34:14.805 --> 00:34:17.500
who was an academic, who
was known to be a supporter

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.330
of legal trade unions for blacks.

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:23.040
Anglo-American, the biggest multi-national

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.062
in South Africa, and one
of the biggest in the world

00:34:26.062 --> 00:34:27.300
at that time, actually had someone

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.030
on the Wiehahn Commission.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:32.150
It recommended the
legalization of trade unions,

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:37.150
and they became, indeed,
magnets for political activism,

00:34:39.461 --> 00:34:43.110
and many people criticized Anglo-America

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:46.140
and big business for
having supported this.

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.480
But they did it anyway.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.992
And from the point of view of the economy,

00:34:51.992 --> 00:34:54.472
it worked for them.

00:34:54.472 --> 00:34:57.830
They did have to deal with
very dramatic strikes later,

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:02.830
but they did create first the
National Mineworkers Unions,

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.650
then something called COSATU,

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:09.990
the Conference of South
African Trade Unions;

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:13.993
one of the most powerful
union movements in the world

00:35:13.993 --> 00:35:14.993
was finally created,

00:35:16.187 --> 00:35:17.740
and certainly one of the
most powerful union movements

00:35:18.751 --> 00:35:20.010
in the world today.

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:22.400
So, that turned out to be important.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.470
It also led to the
development of relationships,

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:28.710
personal relationships
between business leaders,

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.530
and people who were widely represented

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:33.900
in the libration movement;

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.957
something that had not previously existed.

00:35:36.957 --> 00:35:40.690
I said that industrial
sanctions didn't work.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:44.033
The same was not true
of financial sanctions.

00:35:45.351 --> 00:35:50.351
In the mid 1980s, amidst all the pressure,

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:55.440
eventually Chase and Citi
Bank refused to roll over

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.120
South Africa's debt, and
they couldn't pay it,

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:01.650
so it was a massive run on the banks.

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:06.650
And huge capital outflows,
and that created a crisis

00:36:07.378 --> 00:36:11.353
in the financial sector
that was not resolved.

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:16.617
What the leaders, and you can
see this if you go on the case

00:36:16.617 --> 00:36:19.350
and look at the interview
with Sidney Frankel,

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:20.493
now deceased,

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:26.660
they responded to this
by running junkyards,

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:30.280
and bringing business
people to the country

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.660
to try and convince them that South Africa

00:36:34.744 --> 00:36:36.896
was worth investing in,
that they shouldn't leave,

00:36:36.896 --> 00:36:38.040
and they had set up meetings for them

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.353
with government officials,

00:36:40.294 --> 00:36:42.367
and took them around plants, and so forth,

00:36:42.367 --> 00:36:44.511
and weekends in Cougar National Park.

00:36:44.511 --> 00:36:48.080
And they also had them meet
with leaders of the liberation

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.130
movement, which the
government didn't like but

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:52.878
they tolerated it.

00:36:52.878 --> 00:36:56.357
It was complete failure form
the point of view of either

00:36:56.357 --> 00:37:00.990
stopping capital outflows,
or bringing capital in.

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:03.320
But again, it was a way in which leaders

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.410
of the South African
financial sector developed

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:09.080
personal relationships with people

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.040
in the liberation movement

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:15.713
that would turn out to be important later.

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:21.873
So, these relationships were built,

00:37:22.869 --> 00:37:27.869
and they had the effect of
breaking down the barriers,

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:29.823
at least at the elite level,

00:37:30.777 --> 00:37:32.720
between the leaders of
the liberation movement,

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:36.970
and the leaders of both
the big mining companies,

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:40.513
and South Africa's financial sector.

00:37:41.968 --> 00:37:42.918
What about carrots?

00:37:43.798 --> 00:37:45.103
Why might carrots matter?

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:53.373
Carrots are important
because even if people think

00:37:53.373 --> 00:37:57.600
the status quo is not an option anymore,

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.220
they may nonetheless dig in their heels.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:05.220
So for instance in the
1960s, and 70s, in Rhodesia

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:11.480
as it then was, the white
farmers didn't see any

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:14.330
good future, and so they dug in behind the

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:16.790
Ian smith government until the very end,

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:20.920
until basically the British
pulled the plug on him.

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:24.952
We're gonna talk more about
Israel Palestine in a few

00:38:24.952 --> 00:38:26.843
classes from now.

00:38:27.774 --> 00:38:30.338
But I can't tell you how
many Israeli businessmen

00:38:30.338 --> 00:38:33.377
I have interviewed who say,
"the status quo is terrible

00:38:33.377 --> 00:38:38.077
"we hate it, it sucks, and the
alternatives are all worse."

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:40.363
And they mean it,

00:38:41.403 --> 00:38:42.236
they believe it,

00:38:42.236 --> 00:38:43.069
that's how the world looks to them.

00:38:44.654 --> 00:38:47.700
So in addition to thinking
that the status quo is bad,

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.193
maybe even untenable,

00:38:50.222 --> 00:38:53.110
people have to be able to see
a possible future that has

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:54.878
some appeal,

00:38:54.878 --> 00:38:57.690
at least greater appeal
that then status quo.

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:01.713
And the important thing here
was the collapse of communism.

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:06.240
Because the leadership of
the ANC and the leadership

00:39:07.076 --> 00:39:08.740
of the South African
communist party had pretty

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.088
much been the same people;

00:39:11.088 --> 00:39:14.045
the same actual individuals,
people like Joe Slovo.

00:39:14.045 --> 00:39:18.060
And believe me, these people were not like

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:21.180
Euro-communist in expensive Italian suits.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.980
Just to give you a sense of
what kind of communist party

00:39:25.137 --> 00:39:27.783
it was, during that coup in Moscow,

00:39:28.648 --> 00:39:30.020
or failed coup in Moscow,

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.880
that I talked about in the first class

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.000
on the collapse of the Soviet Union,

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.090
those three days when
Gorbachev was locked up in his

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:39.703
dasher on the Black Sea.

00:39:41.197 --> 00:39:44.530
Three communist parties in
the world recognized the coup,

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.560
one of which was the good old SACP.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:51.190
So these were hard-lined
Stalinist communists,

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:53.180
and known to be such.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.853
Why are they known to be such?

00:39:55.709 --> 00:39:59.090
And in fact, the leader
of the South African

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:01.020
communist party, Bram Fischer,

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.510
had been an Africana judge,

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:05.250
and a son of the state president,

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:10.140
and was caught and horribly tortured

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.360
for the rest of his life in prison.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.860
So you know their gloves
were off with the communists,

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.920
and people, and as far
as white business elites

00:40:19.317 --> 00:40:23.015
were concerned, the big
fear was that if you had a

00:40:23.015 --> 00:40:26.170
transition to majority rule,
there would be communism.

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:27.544
Right?

00:40:27.544 --> 00:40:30.271
The ANC and the South
African communist party were

00:40:30.271 --> 00:40:33.582
were wanting the same thing
from their point of view.

00:40:33.582 --> 00:40:35.823
Once communism started
to go off the table,

00:40:36.872 --> 00:40:38.360
that reality changed.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:43.360
As one business man I interviewed put it,

00:40:52.071 --> 00:40:55.590
he said, "I woke up one
day and realized we do not

00:40:56.624 --> 00:40:59.477
"have to be Cuba, we can be Brazil."

00:41:01.308 --> 00:41:05.654
And when that light bulb went off for him,

00:41:05.654 --> 00:41:08.550
it was an epiphany,

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:10.978
because they suddenly realized

00:41:10.978 --> 00:41:13.720
that there was a possible future for them

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.123
in a new order.

00:41:16.332 --> 00:41:21.240
And particularly once you see
the status quo is collapsing,

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:26.240
you wanna get to a better
future if once you can

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:29.703
see that possibility.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:35.940
So, an important fact about
South African business

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:40.630
is that the ownership of
the economy was highly

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:42.493
concentrated at this time.

00:41:44.552 --> 00:41:46.952
Mining had long been
dominated by a small number

00:41:48.054 --> 00:41:50.580
huge companies: Anglo-American
and DeBeers being

00:41:51.598 --> 00:41:52.703
the two most important.

00:41:53.937 --> 00:41:56.387
Just to give you a sense, in 1985,

00:41:56.387 --> 00:41:58.614
Anglo controlled more than
half of the capitalization

00:41:58.614 --> 00:42:00.700
of the whole Johannesburg Stock Exchange,

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:04.586
and the top five corporate
groups controlled 80% of it.

00:42:04.586 --> 00:42:08.020
Concentration in manufacturing
had been increasing

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:13.020
since the 70s, and by 1985,
the largest 5% of firms

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:17.519
contributed at least 50% of output.

00:42:17.519 --> 00:42:22.519
So, even though the South
African economy is not an

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.232
oil curse kind of a story,

00:42:26.232 --> 00:42:28.093
it was a pretty diversified economy.

00:42:29.165 --> 00:42:32.350
It was owned by a small
number of large conglomerates.

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:36.164
Mike Spica who is the
general manager of Anglo

00:42:36.164 --> 00:42:37.970
that I interviewed in one of those videos,

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:39.783
which you can see in the case,

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:44.981
he said, "you can get nine
people around a table,

00:42:44.981 --> 00:42:46.727
"would have been nine men,

00:42:46.727 --> 00:42:48.563
"you can get nine men around the table,

00:42:48.563 --> 00:42:50.907
"and you basically had
the whole South African

00:42:50.907 --> 00:42:52.240
"economy there."

00:42:53.363 --> 00:42:54.822
So, this is just, again,

00:42:54.822 --> 00:42:56.637
you can peruse this at your leisure,

00:42:56.637 --> 00:43:00.560
but this captures the
conglomerate quality of Anglo,

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.054
all the bits and pieces that it owned,

00:43:04.054 --> 00:43:05.104
and its subsidiaries.

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:09.074
Why did that matter?

00:43:09.074 --> 00:43:10.800
It mattered because it meant

00:43:11.939 --> 00:43:14.160
that business could act together.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.020
This is a picture of what economists,

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:20.863
or political economists,

00:43:22.297 --> 00:43:23.130
have referred to as a K Group.

00:43:25.041 --> 00:43:28.600
So if you have a lot of actors
who need something together,

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.992
there's a collective action problem.

00:43:30.992 --> 00:43:31.825
Right?

00:43:31.825 --> 00:43:35.200
How do you get them to
coordinate and pay the costs

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:38.330
of coordinating to provide
some good from which

00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:39.723
they will all benefit.

00:43:40.657 --> 00:43:42.699
A classic collective action problem,

00:43:42.699 --> 00:43:45.370
for which man sir Olsen is famous.

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:49.130
So the idea of a K Group is,
is if there's a sub group

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:53.810
within that group that has
the quality that if they

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:56.930
can solve their own
collective action problems

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:58.820
within the sub group,

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.070
and provide the collective good,

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:04.762
it's worth it to them to
let everybody else freeride.

00:44:04.762 --> 00:44:09.430
The benefits of providing
it for them are such

00:44:10.463 --> 00:44:12.020
that it's worth it let
everybody else freeride.

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:15.830
So these big corporate players
like Anglo, and DeBeers,

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:20.680
and Paula Rand, and the
other major companies

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.133
formed a K Group,

00:44:23.416 --> 00:44:26.800
and they get and meet at
somebody's house and talk about

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.242
what business was going to do,

00:44:29.242 --> 00:44:34.242
and that made it possible
first to solve their collective

00:44:34.669 --> 00:44:37.700
action problem,

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:40.750
but it also made it possible
for them to intimidate

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:41.623
the government.

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:48.370
If you read Adam Tooze, a
former colleague sadly lost

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:50.720
to Columbia, he's fantastically good.

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.740
Economic history of the third Reich;

00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:55.193
The Wages of Destruction.

00:44:56.430 --> 00:45:00.370
You know, part of Tooze's
story is that when German

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:02.840
big business started
giving Hitler trouble,

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.870
he threw a couple of people in prison,

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:07.040
and everybody else fell into line.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:10.050
A bit like the story
of Putin and Tarkovsky

00:45:11.007 --> 00:45:12.757
that I talked to you about earlier.

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:17.257
I think it would be too much
to say that in the 1980s,

00:45:19.001 --> 00:45:22.260
South African government
were country bumpkins.

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:27.136
But they basically, their
big base of voter support

00:45:27.136 --> 00:45:30.810
was Africans farmers, they
were not very involved

00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:32.623
in the commercial sector,

00:45:33.531 --> 00:45:36.082
that changed over the course of the 1980s;

00:45:36.082 --> 00:45:39.450
Africanas began moving
in significant numbers

00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:41.480
into the corporate sector.

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:44.505
But certainly at the
beginning of the 1980s,

00:45:44.505 --> 00:45:48.360
if they had tried to
take over Anglo-American,

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.480
the government wouldn't
have had the first clue

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.540
to what to do with.

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:55.950
So business was in a
strategically strong position

00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:57.500
vis-a-vis the government,

00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.903
and they could act together,

00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:02.170
the big players could set the tone,

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:06.160
and maybe the terms of
what was going to happen.

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:10.213
And, they had a double agenda,

00:46:12.043 --> 00:46:15.526
they wanted, first of all,
not to have a civil war,

00:46:15.526 --> 00:46:18.380
or some massive repressive
outcome that would be horrific

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:22.521
to live in, but they also,

00:46:22.521 --> 00:46:24.364
so they wanted a transition,

00:46:24.364 --> 00:46:26.547
and they maybe thought
some kind of transition

00:46:26.547 --> 00:46:27.890
was more or less inevitable,

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:31.350
but they also wanted to have
a big influence on the ANC.

00:46:32.838 --> 00:46:34.760
Because the ANC, who were
were the ANC leaders?

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.700
After all, they were either living in,

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.363
they were either imprisoned
on Robben Island,

00:46:41.758 --> 00:46:43.653
Mandela and his friends,

00:46:43.653 --> 00:46:45.891
or, you know, they were scattered around,

00:46:45.891 --> 00:46:47.601
some in London, some in East Europe.

00:46:47.601 --> 00:46:49.370
What they knew about economics,

00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:51.713
they had learned from reading, you know,

00:46:53.167 --> 00:46:54.760
summaries of Das Capitale
and the Communist Manifesto

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.550
in East European Guerrilla Training Camps.

00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:01.556
And, you know, the leaders
of South African business

00:47:01.556 --> 00:47:03.295
knew this.

00:47:03.295 --> 00:47:06.223
So what they wanted to do was, you know,

00:47:06.223 --> 00:47:09.830
they like everybody else
were reading the Economist

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:13.570
every week, and drinking up
the Washington Consensus,

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:15.570
and all of that, South African Business.

00:47:16.497 --> 00:47:18.504
They wanted the new South Africa

00:47:18.504 --> 00:47:20.540
to be part of that new story.

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:24.105
And so a big part of their
agenda was to influence the ANC.

00:47:24.105 --> 00:47:27.271
This is why I said dual-agenda;

00:47:27.271 --> 00:47:32.271
to be handmaidens for a peaceful
transition to democracy,

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:38.070
and to disabuse the ANC of
its traditional positions,

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:40.580
which were about nationalizing the command

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:42.343
during the heights of the economy.

00:47:44.287 --> 00:47:45.500
And so they acted first.

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:49.490
In 1985, the head of
Anglo-American, Gavin Relly,

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:54.490
just went to Lusaka and
met with the leadership

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:58.770
of the ANC in exile himself.

00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:00.310
And the government as furious,

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:02.530
they criticized him,
and they attacked him,

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:04.610
but they couldn't stop him.

00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:06.723
When student groups, and church groups,

00:48:07.836 --> 00:48:09.537
and others said, "we're gonna do it too,"

00:48:09.537 --> 00:48:11.100
they said, "we'll throw you
in jail if you do that."

00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:14.130
But they didn't stop business groups,

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:17.420
and this became known as the Lusaka trek.

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:19.670
These business elites
started going backwards

00:48:20.653 --> 00:48:24.500
and forwards to Lusaka and to Mozambique,

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:29.260
and eventually a whole second
set of business leaders

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:33.020
started meeting thanks to
Kans Gold Consolidated Gold

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:37.202
Company in London, with the
leadership in exile in London.

00:48:37.202 --> 00:48:41.413
And so they started having these talks.

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:47.080
And they then also decided
they had better start

00:48:48.218 --> 00:48:50.768
talking to the ANC,
underground ANC in the country.

00:48:52.201 --> 00:48:54.720
The ANC was banned, but there
was a front organization

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.930
called The United
Democratic Fund, the UDF,

00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:00.560
and they started having
secret meetings with them.

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.320
In people's living rooms.

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.830
This is stuff for which you
could be thrown in prison

00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:08.700
without trial, for 90 days,
and then later for 180 days.

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:09.650
And what they would do,

00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:14.230
they would throw you in prison
for 90 days, or 180 days,

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:16.800
without trial, and as you
were walking out the door,

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.560
they would throw you
in for another 180 days

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.393
without trial.

00:49:19.393 --> 00:49:21.510
There were people who
were in there for years,

00:49:23.142 --> 00:49:25.258
many years, under these detention laws.

00:49:25.258 --> 00:49:28.330
So these people were taking
huge risks meeting with

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.140
the leaders of the UDF in the mid 1980s.

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:39.610
And after a while, the UDF got, you know,

00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:41.965
irritated with this, they said,

00:49:41.965 --> 00:49:45.017
"well, you know, it's cool
to have nice conversations

00:49:45.017 --> 00:49:48.297
"in people's living rooms,
but we need an organization

00:49:48.297 --> 00:49:51.610
"to deal with; we need
you to form a group."

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:54.082
And so eventually they did,

00:49:54.082 --> 00:49:54.990
they formed this group called

00:49:56.159 --> 00:49:58.480
the Consulted Business Movement in 1988.

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:02.200
And what was hugely important
about this group was

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:05.407
that they were the first
group of white elites to say,

00:50:05.407 --> 00:50:10.407
"we favor majority rule
democracy for South Africa;

00:50:10.547 --> 00:50:12.650
"one person, one vote."

00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:14.940
Because all the white
parties in government,

00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:18.560
including the white opposition
had been talking about

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:23.560
power sharing deals, you know,
vetos for minority groups,

00:50:23.912 --> 00:50:28.620
educational qualifications
for the franchise,

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:29.453
you name it.

00:50:30.953 --> 00:50:33.317
But the CBM was the first group to say,

00:50:33.317 --> 00:50:35.780
"we are for a normal."

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:39.277
ANC had kept calling it,
"we want a normal democracy

00:50:39.277 --> 00:50:41.519
"in South Africa."

00:50:41.519 --> 00:50:44.130
So that solved their credibility problem.

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:47.404
They didn't say, "we're
neutral about the politics.

00:50:47.404 --> 00:50:49.360
"If we're committed to
a democratic transition,

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:53.297
"then we will work to bring it about."

00:50:55.029 --> 00:50:57.860
And that meant they were
the only credible brokers.

00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.121
Church groups were all aligned

00:51:00.121 --> 00:51:01.790
with different political parties.

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:05.730
There was nobody else that
could be credible brokers

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:09.183
between the government an the ANC.

00:51:10.666 --> 00:51:15.666
And so, just to give you
one pointed illustration

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:18.743
of how they broke it,

00:51:20.279 --> 00:51:23.150
this is a famous Sidney Frankel story.

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:26.450
He thought it was important
that the two chief

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:31.255
negotiators, who would be
the two deputies of the ANC

00:51:31.255 --> 00:51:33.881
and the government, should
get to know each other.

00:51:33.881 --> 00:51:36.143
They turned out to be the
two chief negotiators,

00:51:37.032 --> 00:51:41.123
Ramaphosa and South African
deputy president Roelf Meyer.

00:51:42.777 --> 00:51:45.350
So the took them fishing
on this trout farm.

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:48.580
He arranged for them to
be brought in helicopters.

00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:53.360
So the story goes, they went
fishing and Ramaphosa got

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:56.045
a fish hook stuck in this finger,

00:51:56.045 --> 00:52:00.470
and I am sorry, Meyer got a
fish hook stuck in his finger,

00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:02.907
and Ramaphosa said, "I
Know how to fix that,

00:52:02.907 --> 00:52:05.347
"bring me some pliers,
and a bottle of brandy."

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:08.809
And they did, and he said,
"you drink the brandy,

00:52:08.809 --> 00:52:11.567
"give me the pliers, but
you have to trust me."

00:52:13.517 --> 00:52:16.270
And so the story goes that
this was the bonding moment

00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:19.270
between, who knows whether it's true,

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:23.550
but it stands for the proposition
that the business elites

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:27.342
were facilitating the
personal interaction between

00:52:27.342 --> 00:52:29.893
the government and the ANC.

00:52:32.093 --> 00:52:33.640
They formed the Consultative
Business Movement,

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:34.853
as I've said to you.

00:52:35.863 --> 00:52:39.452
And then once the CODESA
talks were planned,

00:52:39.452 --> 00:52:43.170
there was no other group
that could be trusted

00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:47.693
to function as a
secretariat for the groups,

00:52:47.693 --> 00:52:50.357
for the CODESA talks.

00:52:50.357 --> 00:52:55.357
So, the CBM became essentially
the convener the round table

00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:02.570
talks between, among, the 19 parties.

00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:06.501
And when CODESA I collapsed,
it was the CBM people

00:53:06.501 --> 00:53:11.485
who did all the running around
to get CBM reconstituted

00:53:11.485 --> 00:53:13.503
the following May, CODESA
reconstituted the following May,

00:53:17.108 --> 00:53:18.570
as CODESA II.

00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:23.570
And when CODESA II collapsed
after Boipatong and all that,

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:29.903
it was they who became the back channel,

00:53:31.268 --> 00:53:33.116
walkers in the woods, so to speak,

00:53:33.116 --> 00:53:36.350
keeping the conversation going.

00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:41.113
So hugely important role
that business played in

00:53:41.113 --> 00:53:46.113
convening the talks and
then picking up the pieces

00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:50.993
when they fell apart.

00:53:53.754 --> 00:53:57.583
So, managing spoilers.

00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:03.483
I talked earlier about the
Kissinger Carrington visit.

00:54:06.008 --> 00:54:09.360
That was also organized
at the behest of the CMB,

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:13.623
but more importantly, once it fell apart,

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:19.520
it was then that the Consultative
Business Movement people

00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:23.830
who decided that they had to
act to pick up the pieces.

00:54:23.830 --> 00:54:27.880
And if you look at the
interview with Colin Coleman

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:32.304
in the video.

00:54:32.304 --> 00:54:34.270
Colin Coleman is an interesting man.

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:38.594
He was an architecture student at Wits,

00:54:38.594 --> 00:54:40.150
University of Witwatersrand,

00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:43.573
came of age, he just
graduated in mid 1980s,

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:48.497
and was the first full-time
employee of the CBM,

00:54:48.497 --> 00:54:52.090
and they hired him right out of college

00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:56.877
to work in facilitating
the talks with the ANC.

00:54:58.722 --> 00:55:01.380
Today, he's, by the way,
the head of Goldman Sachs

00:55:02.613 --> 00:55:03.500
for Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:07.254
But in those days he was
actually a member of the ANC,

00:55:07.254 --> 00:55:10.340
young ANC member, although
he was white was unusual,

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:13.580
and so he had a certain
amount of street credibility

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:15.803
in talking to the ANC.

00:55:16.714 --> 00:55:21.470
And he was he one after
the Kissinger people

00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:22.893
packed up and left,

00:55:23.862 --> 00:55:28.030
who went racing around
trying to figure out

00:55:29.512 --> 00:55:34.512
what would get Buthelezi to
participate in the election,

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:37.299
what would get Inkartha to participate?

00:55:37.299 --> 00:55:42.299
And they basically, they
wanted various guarantees

00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:47.130
for the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini,

00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:52.130
they wanted protections of
property in KwaZulu-Natal,

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:56.410
they wanted a variety assurances

00:55:56.410 --> 00:55:59.960
that they were gonna have
some say in the politics.

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:04.630
And so, it was crisis
management and shuttle diplomacy

00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:09.630
that defused the violence
that you saw in the final

00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:12.890
run up to the election.

00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:17.643
There were also just massive
issues of election mechanics.

00:56:20.138 --> 00:56:25.138
So, one interesting tidbit
here is because the election

00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:33.090
date was non-negotiable,
it had to occur in April,

00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:35.170
or the country would have really descended

00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:37.839
into a complete civil war.

00:56:37.839 --> 00:56:41.560
The ballots had already been
printed when it was clear that

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:44.214
Inkatha was not going to participate.

00:56:44.214 --> 00:56:49.214
And finally, virtually
Coleman and others had gotten

00:56:53.828 --> 00:56:56.860
Inkatha to agree to
virtually to virtually all,

00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:00.880
gotten the government and the ANC to agree

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:03.649
to virtually of Inkatha's demands.

00:57:03.649 --> 00:57:05.594
But one of the wants, they said,

00:57:05.594 --> 00:57:07.385
"we've gotta push the election back,

00:57:07.385 --> 00:57:09.117
"cause we haven't been campaigning."

00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:12.850
You know, so they wanted
to push the election back.

00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:15.560
And of course, both the
government and the ANC

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:17.783
knew that that was a non-starter.

00:57:18.817 --> 00:57:23.140
And so, finally, they were
confronted with the problem,

00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:27.130
again, tiny things, you know.

00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:29.400
The person who said don't
let small things bother

00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:31.150
you, has never spent the night in a tank

00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:32.283
with a mosquito.

00:57:33.411 --> 00:57:36.060
So, the problem was
that the national party

00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:38.400
was on the bottom of the ballot,

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:41.472
and they had been
campaigning on the slogan:

00:57:41.472 --> 00:57:44.021
"Vote the bottom line,
vote the bottom line."

00:57:44.021 --> 00:57:46.510
But there was no other
place to put a stick on,

00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:47.663
on the ballots.

00:57:48.597 --> 00:57:50.733
And these stick-ons had to be printed and,

00:57:51.891 --> 00:57:53.508
you know, in record time.

00:57:53.508 --> 00:57:54.740
And this is a developing country,

00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:57.630
it's not you know, I mean
I know we have our issues

00:57:57.630 --> 00:58:00.020
with butterfly ballots
and election interfering

00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:00.853
and all that,

00:58:01.943 --> 00:58:04.200
but this was a huge logistical operation.

00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:08.000
So first, the national
party had to be convinced

00:58:09.599 --> 00:58:12.381
that it was so dangerous
not to have Inkatha

00:58:12.381 --> 00:58:13.214
on the ballot,

00:58:14.052 --> 00:58:15.996
that they had to not withstand it.

00:58:15.996 --> 00:58:18.520
Their "vote the bottom line"
slogan on all their literature,

00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:19.930
that had to,

00:58:19.930 --> 00:58:22.730
there was no other place for
the stick-on but to go there.

00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:25.397
Then the stick-ons had to be printed,

00:58:25.397 --> 00:58:26.730
they had to be flown around the country.

00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:31.440
Business played a role in all of that.

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:34.830
And so you get the election result.

00:58:34.830 --> 00:58:38.170
And, the election as I
said to you last time,

00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:41.108
was widely declared to be free and fair.

00:58:41.108 --> 00:58:46.108
And there is a wrinkle to that though

00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:49.922
that's always struck me.

00:58:49.922 --> 00:58:52.516
I've never seen reporting upon on it,

00:58:52.516 --> 00:58:56.272
which is that the election
results took several days

00:58:56.272 --> 00:58:58.790
to, you know, finally offer the case.

00:58:58.790 --> 00:59:02.120
And when you got paper
ballots being counted by hand,

00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:04.400
it took three or four
days to get the final

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:06.240
election results.

00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:08.328
But at the end of the first day,

00:59:08.328 --> 00:59:10.440
it was declared that KwaZulu,

00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:14.660
that Inkatha had won KwaZulu-Natal

00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:16.524
regional parliament,

00:59:16.524 --> 00:59:19.280
and that they had enough
votes for three seats

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:20.373
in the cabinet.

00:59:21.548 --> 00:59:23.873
And so, you know, I could never prove it,

00:59:23.873 --> 00:59:26.250
but I have sneaking
suspicion that that part

00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:29.870
of the election results
was negotiated in advance

00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:30.703
of the election.

00:59:34.331 --> 00:59:35.881
Building civil society support.

00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:40.940
Again here, business
worked with church groups

00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:44.190
and others to put together
hundreds and hundreds

00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:45.520
of meetings,

00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:48.960
where they would come
and talk about scenarios,

00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:53.960
they would come and talk about
how the economy might unfold

00:59:54.219 --> 00:59:55.950
in the future.

00:59:55.950 --> 00:59:57.813
They would do this,

00:59:58.826 --> 01:00:01.720
part of their effort to influence the ANC.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:04.290
Which, by the way, they
succeeded in doing.

01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:06.950
When the ANC came to power,

01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:10.264
it still articulated a
pretty staunch socialist

01:00:10.264 --> 01:00:13.042
economic program.

01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:16.740
They had a manifesto called

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:19.583
Reconstruction and Development,

01:00:20.517 --> 01:00:24.563
and it talked about nationalization.

01:00:25.874 --> 01:00:27.570
Mandela's first international visit

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:29.613
when he came out of prison was to Cuba;

01:00:30.625 --> 01:00:32.719
heavily criticized by the Americans.

01:00:32.719 --> 01:00:37.719
Yet, but within months of coming to power,

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.578
the ANC had largely repudiated its RDP,

01:00:41.578 --> 01:00:45.240
Reconstruction and Development Plan,

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:48.200
and instead embraced something called

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:53.200
GIER, Growth In Economic Reconstruction.

01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:56.480
I forgot what it stood for,

01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:00.250
but basically it was a shift
to the Washington Consensus

01:01:00.250 --> 01:01:01.853
to a very large extent.

01:01:04.324 --> 01:01:08.430
It basically put off massive
transformation of the economy,

01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:12.953
the effects of which I'll talk
about briefly in a minute.

01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:16.597
They created an election fund,

01:01:16.597 --> 01:01:18.130
they helped with the
logistics of the election,

01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:22.683
and ensured that the elections
would be free and fair.

01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:29.500
So, quite a remarkable story in many ways.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.723
Business does not normally
behave in this way.

01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:39.310
And there were undeniably
notable achievements.

01:01:39.310 --> 01:01:43.205
The first is that they
avoided catastrophe.

01:01:43.205 --> 01:01:47.660
I think that it is a fair
retrospective judgment

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:51.253
that but for the things that
businesses were able to do,

01:01:52.155 --> 01:01:55.857
both in creating relationships
and networks in serving

01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:03.300
as through the consultant of
business movement convener

01:02:04.959 --> 01:02:07.930
of talks, and picking up the
pieces when they repeatedly

01:02:07.930 --> 01:02:09.630
failed, helping to manage the spoilers,

01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:11.600
and getting them to participate.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.940
In all of those ways, there
were important achievements.

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:18.957
They really did help abolish
apartheid in a peaceful way.

01:02:18.957 --> 01:02:21.430
End the country's pariah status.

01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:25.561
And had a lot to do with the
resurgence of the economy;

01:02:25.561 --> 01:02:27.870
this was the era where people
were talking about the BRIC

01:02:29.049 --> 01:02:30.185
countries, right?

01:02:30.185 --> 01:02:32.032
Brazil, India, China.

01:02:32.032 --> 01:02:34.700
Brazil, Russia, India, China.

01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.620
They started talking about
the BRICs because South Africa

01:02:38.729 --> 01:02:40.840
had a big economic resurgence.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:45.136
If you look at sort of
macro-economic and social indicators,

01:02:45.136 --> 01:02:50.136
in the first 12 years or so,

01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:54.050
the number of people living
in poverty went down no

01:02:55.195 --> 01:02:56.430
in a non-trivial way.

01:02:56.430 --> 01:03:01.080
And they did create a black middle class.

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:05.417
Between 1995 and 2009,
half a billion Rand,

01:03:05.417 --> 01:03:07.630
and that was when the
Rand was worth a lot more

01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:10.020
than it is today,

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:13.890
was transferred from white
business to black business.

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:17.090
So, in all of these respects,

01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:20.390
you could say there was a
significant achievement.

01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:24.849
And business deserves considerable credit,

01:03:24.849 --> 01:03:27.850
some of these business
leaders for taking big risks

01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:31.873
and being willing to do what they did.

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:35.471
But on the other side of the ledger there,

01:03:35.471 --> 01:03:38.683
pretty challenging legacies
of the way things unfolded.

01:03:40.278 --> 01:03:43.700
We still have a limited democracy;

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:46.220
single party dominant democracy,

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:48.713
as I talked about last week.

01:03:50.097 --> 01:03:52.440
Those tend to be very corrupt,

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.353
South Africa is not special in this.

01:03:55.206 --> 01:03:59.917
Go to Russia, go to Mexico,
go to India for a long time,

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.855
single party dominant system,

01:04:03.855 --> 01:04:05.910
very high levels of corruption come with

01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:08.420
single party dominant systems.

01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:11.280
The politically entrenched
labor movement has been

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:15.060
very costly for the country over time

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:19.990
because it protects, and
this is the South African

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:23.660
variant of the story we were
walking about in Germany

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:27.540
and in the advance
capitalist countries earlier

01:04:28.434 --> 01:04:29.844
in the course.

01:04:29.844 --> 01:04:33.310
We have very high wage
economy in the formal sector,

01:04:33.310 --> 01:04:36.718
but we have huge unemployment;

01:04:36.718 --> 01:04:40.563
we have 30% unemployment,

01:04:41.492 --> 01:04:43.884
and almost 50% youth unemployment,

01:04:43.884 --> 01:04:46.859
one of the highest youth
unemployment rates in the world.

01:04:46.859 --> 01:04:49.050
South Africa homages
textile jobs to Lo Soto,

01:04:49.050 --> 01:04:50.980
even to China.

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:55.973
So you have the downstream
effect of this very powerful

01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:03.880
entrenched organized labor
movement that's wired

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:05.003
into the government.

01:05:05.977 --> 01:05:09.340
By the way, that all exploded in 2012,

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:14.340
at a platinum mine in a
place called Marikana.

01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:19.080
Where again, ironically
in view of the 1970s,

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:22.510
wildcat strikes were
organized against the unions

01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:25.450
and existing managements
for sweetheart deals

01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:27.350
that they believed were excluding them,

01:05:27.350 --> 01:05:31.830
and about 34, I think it
was, people were shot dead

01:05:31.830 --> 01:05:33.820
by the police, many in the back.

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:37.227
Huge blood on Cyril Ramaphosa's character,

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:43.070
because it made it much
harder for him to win the ANC

01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:46.780
leadership in 2018 because
he was one of the directors

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:48.903
of Marikana mine.

01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:55.210
Since the transition, businesses
completely disengaged.

01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:59.253
While they were very proactive
at this time of crisis;

01:06:00.299 --> 01:06:02.270
it's much harder to get people's attention

01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:04.990
a chronic problem, than for a crisis.

01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:08.900
And after the transition,
South Africa's problems back

01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:10.950
from being crisis to chronic:

01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:15.410
The inequality, the poverty,
the lack of racial integration,

01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:18.170
except for elites.

01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:22.401
And so if you look,
this is a Lorenz Curve,

01:06:22.401 --> 01:06:26.160
which a Lorenz Curve is just
another way of depicting

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:29.429
the Gini Coefficient
measure of inequality.

01:06:29.429 --> 01:06:33.130
You can see the dotted line is 2009,

01:06:39.988 --> 01:06:41.950
the blue line is 1996.

01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:44.600
So in the first decade and
a half after apartheid,

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:48.439
the overall structure of
inequality in the economy

01:06:48.439 --> 01:06:49.970
has not changed.

01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:53.552
And a decade later, it
would be much different.

01:06:53.552 --> 01:06:57.023
This was in the Wall Street Journal,

01:06:58.436 --> 01:06:59.830
four years ago now.

01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:01.702
But these numbers wouldn't have

01:07:01.702 --> 01:07:04.430
substantially different today.

01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:06.133
On the left-hand column there,

01:07:06.994 --> 01:07:08.690
you can see, again Gini Coefficients,

01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:11.170
you can see South Africa is one of

01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:14.370
the most unequal countries
even decades after

01:07:14.370 --> 01:07:18.480
the end of apartheid in the world.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:21.000
It's actually got the
highest Gini Coefficient

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.710
of countries for which we have data.

01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:26.434
That doesn't mean the
highest in the world,

01:07:26.434 --> 01:07:29.510
I suspect if we had data for
places like Saudi Arabia,

01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:32.524
it might have a higher Gini Coefficient.

01:07:32.524 --> 01:07:35.520
But in any event, it's basically 0.7,

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:38.221
enormously unequal,

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:40.878
even more unequal than, you can see there,

01:07:40.878 --> 01:07:43.890
than countries like
Columbia, Brazil, and Mexico.

01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:46.840
So, unemployment, I
already told you the story.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.410
But you break unemployment down by race,

01:07:49.410 --> 01:07:53.450
and you can see that, you
know, a third of the black

01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:55.870
population is unemployed.

01:07:55.870 --> 01:08:00.047
Half of the black youth
population is unemployed.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:09.702
If you look at other social indicators,

01:08:09.702 --> 01:08:12.045
if you look at people living in poverty,

01:08:12.045 --> 01:08:15.223
half the black population
is still living in poverty.

01:08:16.689 --> 01:08:18.763
Adults with high school only education.

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:25.380
Again, you've got, you
know, 15% of that black

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:28.133
population has a high school education.

01:08:30.101 --> 01:08:31.810
Private health insurance,

01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:33.960
and the public health
insurance is not very good,

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.640
10% of the black population.

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:40.230
Indoor plumbing, you know,
we're living in the richest

01:08:40.230 --> 01:08:45.230
country in Africa, this is in 2014,

01:08:45.639 --> 01:08:48.210
but not much different today,

01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:50.206
a third of the black population

01:08:50.206 --> 01:08:52.383
does not have indoor plumbing.

01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:55.640
And so, you know,

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:59.970
this is one way of saying
that good things don't

01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:01.243
all go together.

01:09:02.741 --> 01:09:04.333
So you avoided civil war,

01:09:05.548 --> 01:09:10.225
the outcome really would
have been catastrophic.

01:09:10.225 --> 01:09:13.640
Very few historians would
dispute the proposition

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.810
that hundred of thousands,
probably millions of people

01:09:16.810 --> 01:09:17.963
would have been killed.

01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:21.553
And it would have gone on for a long time,

01:09:21.553 --> 01:09:23.608
and it's not clear, at all,

01:09:23.608 --> 01:09:26.218
what would have come out
of the other end of it.

01:09:26.218 --> 01:09:28.600
But we are in a world in which, you know,

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:33.430
there's very substantial
disillusionment as politics

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:38.140
now normalizes and revolutionary
generation passes from

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:43.140
the scene, and we face the
run of the mill problems

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:49.020
that many developing countries face.

01:09:52.657 --> 01:09:54.807
Cyril Ramaphosa, you
saw him as a young man

01:09:55.690 --> 01:09:57.610
in that very first video that I showed,

01:09:57.610 --> 01:10:01.043
where he was a leader of the
National Union of Mineworkers,

01:10:01.891 --> 01:10:04.160
and then COSATU, the chief
negotiator for the ANC,

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:08.154
and he was worried when
in that video talking

01:10:08.154 --> 01:10:10.100
about being shot at.

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:14.633
You know, his story is a
very interesting depiction

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:19.980
of the interaction between
business and politics

01:10:21.154 --> 01:10:22.778
in South Africa over time.

01:10:22.778 --> 01:10:24.690
He begins as an ANC activist,

01:10:24.690 --> 01:10:26.140
he then becomes the head

01:10:27.319 --> 01:10:30.089
of the National Union of
Mineworkers and COSATU,

01:10:30.089 --> 01:10:32.427
eventually the secretary
general of COSATU and chief

01:10:32.427 --> 01:10:35.295
negotiator for the ANC.

01:10:35.295 --> 01:10:39.850
He was edged out of the
succession to Mandela by Mbeki

01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:42.610
when he was the heir apparent,

01:10:43.754 --> 01:10:45.644
so he decided to go off and get rich,

01:10:45.644 --> 01:10:48.793
he became South Africa's
first black billionaire;

01:10:48.793 --> 01:10:51.170
hugely successful.

01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:54.880
Then he came back into
politics as Zuma's deputy,

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.503
and in a very bitter fight,

01:10:59.894 --> 01:11:04.233
finally won the leadership of the ANC.

01:11:05.232 --> 01:11:10.232
But it would be another
entire lecture to go through

01:11:13.699 --> 01:11:16.619
the slandiness of his grip
on the ANC which is partly

01:11:16.619 --> 01:11:19.790
a result of the way in
which it's governed.

01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:23.110
But that will be a topic
for later in the course.

01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:26.440
Next, we will be talking about the ICC and

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:29.693
the Doctrine of Responsibility to Protect.

01:11:32.607 --> 01:11:35.440

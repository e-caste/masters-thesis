00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.860
Prof: So today is Jean
Jacques Rousseau--

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.639
I mean, one of the most
fascinating people in terms of

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.309
his life and his ideas and the
way how he reasons.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.302
He is a provocative,
a provocateur,

00:00:22.302 --> 00:00:30.050
and an extraordinary genius,
in more than one ways.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.962
There are few people whom I
disagree so strongly than in

00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:40.800
many propositions of Jean
Jacques Rousseau.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.584
But there are few people who
turn my mind on so much than

00:00:48.584 --> 00:00:50.670
Jean Jacques.
 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.280
So who was this character?
 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.650
Let me just give you a very
brief overview.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:04.658
He was born in Geneva,
which was a city-state at that

00:01:04.658 --> 00:01:12.610
time--ruled by Calvin for
awhile, a Calvinist stronghold.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.735
We will talk about this when it
comes to Max Weber and The

00:01:17.735 --> 00:01:19.700
Protestant Ethic.
 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.040
Calvin ruled Geneva with an
iron hand.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.909
That's where he was born.
 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.450
His father was Isaac Rousseau.
 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.560
He was a watchmaker and a
Calvinist.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.080
Well he did run into some
trouble.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.000
I don't know exactly what the
trouble was.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.922
I think he was in debt,
so he jumped the boat and went

00:01:48.922 --> 00:01:53.738
to Istanbul, disappeared;
we don't know much about him

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:54.810
beyond that.
 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.849
So at a very early age of ten
he was a kind of orphan.

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:06.140
Then in 1728 he moved to France.
 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.437
And there was a wonderful lady,
about ten years his senior,

00:02:13.437 --> 00:02:18.470
Mrs. Warens,
who was running a home.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:41.574
&lt;&lt;Professor
Szelényi invites students

00:02:41.574 --> 00:02:52.419
to take seats&gt;&gt;
 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.937
Prof: Anyway,
so he met Mrs. Warens,

00:02:55.937 --> 00:03:02.598
who was a Roman Catholic,
and her mission was to convert

00:03:02.598 --> 00:03:08.270
these Calvinists to their proper
faith,

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:15.908
Roman Catholicism-- and took
young boys into her home.

00:03:15.908 --> 00:03:19.937
But who knows,
it looks like she had more

00:03:19.937 --> 00:03:24.370
interests in people,
rather than religion.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.933
So he arrived '28 to Annency.
 

00:03:31.933 --> 00:03:33.758
Right?
 

00:03:33.758 --> 00:03:37.430
Age of 16, a good-looking,
nice guy.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.580
Madame Warens is still a
younger lady.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.473
Here you can see,
you know, Madame Warens and

00:03:48.473 --> 00:03:52.759
Jean Jacques,
meeting in 1728.

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:56.229
Very romantic stuff, right?
 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:04:05.129
Well and here well another
picture.

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.000
You know?
 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.848
Well I don't blame Jean
Jacques,

00:04:09.848 --> 00:04:11.400
&gt;
 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.958
at the age of 16,
to convert to Roman Catholicism

00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:23.209
from the cold Calvinist
religion, and meanwhile being a

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:24.716
bit romantic.
 

00:04:24.716 --> 00:04:25.990
Right?
 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.583
Well Jean Jacques is one of
those few people who wrote a

00:04:31.583 --> 00:04:35.550
Confession--a very funny
book.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.459
He has a sense of self-irony
and self-criticism.

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:43.410
Whether this is genuine,
or he thought this will be the

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.410
way how to sell the book--hard
to tell.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.440
But it's worth reading.
 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.410
It actually was published
posthumously.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.209
And he said Madame de Warens
shaped his character;

00:04:57.209 --> 00:04:59.810
undoubtedly she did.
 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:07.232
And this affair--affair,
who knows, but it looks like it

00:05:07.232 --> 00:05:13.170
was an affair--fascinated people
later on.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:19.160
I think I already cracked this
joke in the introductory

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.269
lecture.
 

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:25.079
A wonderful French writer,
Stendhal,

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:33.360
in his superb novel,
Le Rouge et la Noir,

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.800
was inspired by this
interesting affair--

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.740
a sixteen -year -old boy and a
twenty-eight -year -old woman.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.230
And, in fact,
the story of Julien Sorel--it

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:58.334
means Jean Jacques Rousseau--and
Madame de Renal--de Warens--is

00:05:58.334 --> 00:06:02.649
really the core of the story.
 

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:08.389
So if you have not read Le
Rouge et la Noir,

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:13.439
this is a must for an Ivy
League graduate.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:19.641
You don't want to get a degree
from Yale not having read

00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:24.040
Stendhal, Le Rouge et la
Noir.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.680
It's, of course, in English.
 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.420
But, you know, enough is enough.
 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:37.533
In '42, several years later,
Rousseau has now bigger aims

00:06:37.533 --> 00:06:41.009
and he moves to Paris.
 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:48.273
And he becomes the secretary of
Comte de Montaigue who is a

00:06:48.273 --> 00:06:52.029
French ambassador to Venice.
 

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:57.363
And there are a lot of nice
things--interesting

00:06:57.363 --> 00:07:03.163
things--about Rousseau,
but he was not an easy guy,

00:07:03.163 --> 00:07:08.149
and somehow he always ran into
trouble.

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:13.932
So he ran into trouble in
Venice, and in order to avoid

00:07:13.932 --> 00:07:18.315
arrest and trouble--
I don't know exactly what he

00:07:18.315 --> 00:07:22.370
did, probably something
financially not quite correct--

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:30.278
he had to jump and leave Venice
and Comte de Montaigue.

00:07:30.278 --> 00:07:34.963
He moves to Paris,
and he knows how to find good

00:07:34.963 --> 00:07:35.959
friends.
 

00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:41.636
He also will know how to make
great enemies from his good

00:07:41.636 --> 00:07:42.649
friends.
 

00:07:42.649 --> 00:07:45.329
So he meets Diderot.
 

00:07:45.329 --> 00:07:48.283
And we already know Diderot,
and we know already

00:07:48.283 --> 00:07:51.930
Encyclopédie and
the French Enlightenment.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:58.439
And he was asked to write an
article on music for the

00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:02.069
Encyclopédie.
 

00:08:02.069 --> 00:08:04.569
And this is Diderot.
 

00:08:04.569 --> 00:08:10.310
Okay, and then he meets
Thérèse Lavasseur.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:16.137
He was staying in a hotel,
and Thérèse

00:08:16.137 --> 00:08:20.480
Lavasseur was a maid in this
hotel,

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:27.649
and a long-lasting relationship
develops between the two which--

00:08:27.649 --> 00:08:30.742
well I already told you,
don't worry if you don't marry

00:08:30.742 --> 00:08:31.430
instantly.
 

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.558
He was not married instantly
either.

00:08:34.558 --> 00:08:42.285
It took him some time to decide
that this date should actually

00:08:42.285 --> 00:08:46.340
culminate in a legal marriage.
 

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:51.779
She became a companion for all
of his life.

00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:56.734
Well I would not bet my life
that she was,

00:08:56.734 --> 00:09:02.534
for the rest of life,
the only woman in his life,

00:09:02.534 --> 00:09:07.370
but certainly she was his
companion.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.059
I don't know about her.
 

00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:12.418
They married in '68.
 

00:09:12.418 --> 00:09:16.085
So you can see it took some
time for Rousseau to say,

00:09:16.085 --> 00:09:19.750
"Well this is something
which should end up in a

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.090
marriage."
 

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.605
And here is--okay,
here you can see that,

00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:26.690
right?--Thérèse
and Jean Jacques.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:31.070
Well I hope you don't mind I
show you these pictures;

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.269
they don't tell all that much.
 

00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:38.854
Well Jean Jacques,
as I said, was an extraordinary

00:09:38.854 --> 00:09:39.879
genius.
 

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:45.335
He is not only a philosopher,
not only a social scientist,

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:50.886
not only a scientist--he was
writing on science as well--he

00:09:50.886 --> 00:09:52.610
was an artist.
 

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.928
And well, you know,
anybody can write a novel,

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:56.519
right?
 

00:09:56.519 --> 00:10:01.669
I am sure half of this class
considered at one point in your

00:10:01.669 --> 00:10:06.645
life that you will write poetry
or you will write a novel.

00:10:06.645 --> 00:10:07.519
Right?
 

00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:11.118
It's easy;
you sit down and you write a

00:10:11.118 --> 00:10:11.539
novel.
 

00:10:11.539 --> 00:10:13.769
My life is a novel, right?
 

00:10:13.769 --> 00:10:16.000
Most people say that.
 

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.778
But Jean Jacques wrote an opera.
 

00:10:21.778 --> 00:10:25.902
Probably few of you considered
to write an opera.

00:10:25.902 --> 00:10:26.590
Right?
 

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.058
That needs skills. Right?
 

00:10:29.058 --> 00:10:33.657
And he did one,
Le Devin du Village.

00:10:33.657 --> 00:10:35.080
I own a CD.
 

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.559
It's a wonderful opera.
 

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:40.570
He's a great composer. Right?
 

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:43.288
Well that's quite unusual.
 

00:10:43.288 --> 00:10:46.408
And, to make it even more
interesting,

00:10:46.408 --> 00:10:52.895
he was in an intense debate--he
was always in an intense debate

00:10:52.895 --> 00:10:57.202
with everybody--
but he was in an intense debate

00:10:57.202 --> 00:10:58.220
with Rameau.
 

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:04.878
And those of you who are a
little familiar with music,

00:11:04.878 --> 00:11:07.139
you know Rameau.
 

00:11:07.139 --> 00:11:14.618
Rameau was the greatest French
composer of the eighteenth

00:11:14.618 --> 00:11:22.495
century, and they had a big
debate because Rousseau believed

00:11:22.495 --> 00:11:25.301
in the Italian opera.
 

00:11:25.301 --> 00:11:26.769
Right?
 

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:35.774
He believed that the melody
should have precedence over

00:11:35.774 --> 00:11:41.379
harmony,
and Rameau wanted to create a

00:11:41.379 --> 00:11:48.125
French opera in which,
you know, melody is not so

00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:53.379
important,
and in fact the harmony is more

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:54.649
important.
 

00:11:54.649 --> 00:11:57.899
It was a revolutionary break.
 

00:11:57.899 --> 00:12:03.129
Rameau paves,
you know--creates a new space

00:12:03.129 --> 00:12:05.620
for the new music.
 

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.812
In some ways he's beginning to
pave the way,

00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:15.761
what we eventually will know as
modern music--an extraordinary

00:12:15.761 --> 00:12:17.028
composer.
 

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:23.224
Well and Rousseau believed in
bel canto,

00:12:23.224 --> 00:12:24.840
Pavarotti.
 

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.558
I know, of course there was no
Pavarotti at that time.

00:12:28.558 --> 00:12:31.662
But you know what bel
canto is--Ave Maria.

00:12:31.662 --> 00:12:32.178
Right?
 

00:12:32.178 --> 00:12:34.884
You create a cry,
you can sing it.

00:12:34.884 --> 00:12:35.538
Right?
 

00:12:35.538 --> 00:12:42.097
That's what he really believed
in, unlike Rameau who was much

00:12:42.097 --> 00:12:46.580
more analytical and emphasized
harmony.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:52.421
Interestingly,
the person whom I think is the

00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:57.200
greatest composer of all
history,

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:03.658
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,
loved Rousseau,

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:10.120
and he wrote an opera what can
be very rarely seen--

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:15.433
occasionally you can catch it
in the Metropolitan Opera of

00:13:15.433 --> 00:13:19.126
Arts,
once in a decade-- Bastien

00:13:19.126 --> 00:13:24.610
und Bastienne,
which was actually inspired by

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.830
Le Devin du Village.
 

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:33.639
Go on amazon.com,
you can buy Rameau,

00:13:33.639 --> 00:13:37.740
you can buy Bastien und
Bastienne,

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.990
and you can buy Le Devin du
Village,

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:44.250
and you can see the differences.
 

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.491
And he, of course,
publishes a novel,

00:13:47.491 --> 00:13:51.995
Julie, or La Nouvelle
Héloise,

00:13:51.995 --> 00:13:56.320
which at that time was an
influential novel.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.120
I don't think too many people
read it today.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:05.899
Well this is Rameau,
and Rameau shadowed modern

00:14:05.899 --> 00:14:07.080
music.
 

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:12.139
Gluck, in particular,
follows from Rameau.

00:14:12.139 --> 00:14:16.451
In fact, you know,
Mozart will be changing in his

00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:17.440
lifetime.
 

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:23.717
We will talk--well I
thought--if there is a musician

00:14:23.717 --> 00:14:28.149
you can read a little Rameau
here.

00:14:28.149 --> 00:14:33.803
Interestingly,
you know, Mozart did not stick

00:14:33.803 --> 00:14:39.330
quite to the Italian opera over
his life.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:47.110
You've probably heard
Zauberflöte;

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:52.519
The Magic Flute, is the
first German opera.

00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:57.210
The earlier Mozart is very much
Italian opera.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.796
Later in life,
Mozart tried to create German

00:15:00.796 --> 00:15:04.883
opera, which has some
similarities with the French

00:15:04.883 --> 00:15:08.970
music--not quite,
because it's more romantic.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:14.043
Okay, he is also a philosopher,
scientist, political

00:15:14.043 --> 00:15:19.116
theorist--I also would say
sociologist and political

00:15:19.116 --> 00:15:20.509
scientist.
 

00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:25.700
The first piece of work is
actually science,

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.080
art, and study of society.
 

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:35.120
Then in 1755,
he writes a very interesting

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.705
book--
if you have spare time,

00:15:37.705 --> 00:15:41.190
read it--Discourse on the
Origins of Inequality--

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:45.139
Again, a very provocative book.
 

00:15:45.139 --> 00:15:51.500
In some ways there is some sort
of Hobbesian idea behind that.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:59.125
He said, well it starts with
love, but if you are really in

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:03.465
love, well you tend to be
jealous.

00:16:03.465 --> 00:16:04.778
Right?
 

00:16:04.778 --> 00:16:10.264
If you are deeply in love,
passionately in love,

00:16:10.264 --> 00:16:17.268
then you don't like that the
person who is the object of your

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:22.169
love may have a love in somebody
else;

00:16:22.169 --> 00:16:24.649
then you are jealous.
 

00:16:24.649 --> 00:16:29.090
And the idea is--this is the
origins of inequality;

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.450
we are jealous, right?
 

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:36.360
There is one precious good--to
put it with Hobbes--

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.426
we all desire,
and if somebody else desires it

00:16:40.426 --> 00:16:43.342
as well,
and has a shot at it,

00:16:43.342 --> 00:16:47.190
to get it, then we become
jealous, right?

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.120
We want to grab it,
we want to monopolize it.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:54.360
So this is a source of
inequality, right?

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:58.470
Well an interesting idea, right?
 

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:02.399
Have you ever experienced that?
 

00:17:02.399 --> 00:17:07.565
Did you have occasionally a
little sense of jealousy in you,

00:17:07.565 --> 00:17:11.593
and thinking no,
this other one should not have

00:17:11.593 --> 00:17:13.519
the one I do have?
 

00:17:13.519 --> 00:17:18.759
I think you probably did.
 

00:17:18.759 --> 00:17:20.500
I did.
 

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:24.528
Okay.
 

00:17:24.528 --> 00:17:28.298
And then comes the big year:
'62.

00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:33.692
He publishes two major books in
one year, two big scandals:

00:17:33.692 --> 00:17:38.250
Social Contract and
Émile.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:42.588
And I will talk to Social
Contract today,

00:17:42.588 --> 00:17:44.990
and Émile.
 

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:49.020
Social Contract is
really a culmination of the

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.960
contractarian argument.
 

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:58.803
Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau did
some extraordinary important new

00:17:58.803 --> 00:18:00.320
innovations.
 

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.460
Right?
 

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:07.713
As we have seen,
in the first contractarian,

00:18:07.713 --> 00:18:15.858
Hobbes had a somewhat limited
idea of social contract;

00:18:15.858 --> 00:18:22.190
probably realistic but not what
you necessarily like.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:27.357
He said a social contract is
not something what you concluded

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:29.769
with the authority,
right?

00:18:29.769 --> 00:18:33.290
Social contract,
what you entered by fear,

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:38.102
and social contract which was
done previously because you

00:18:38.102 --> 00:18:42.138
wanted to have a new contract is
binding on you.

00:18:42.138 --> 00:18:43.170
Right?
 

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:51.003
Locke tended to see a social
contract as sort of between the

00:18:51.003 --> 00:18:55.519
individual and the commonwealth.
 

00:18:55.519 --> 00:18:59.779
This is a nice idea,
that you are bound by a

00:18:59.779 --> 00:19:01.960
contract you signed.
 

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.755
But, you know,
those of you at least who were

00:19:05.755 --> 00:19:10.413
born in these United States,
never signed a contract to

00:19:10.413 --> 00:19:12.829
accept the Constitution.
 

00:19:12.829 --> 00:19:15.730
I am a naturalized citizen.
 

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:17.994
You can say I signed a
contract.

00:19:17.994 --> 00:19:18.578
Right?
 

00:19:18.578 --> 00:19:22.190
I had to swear allegiance to
the United States.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.308
At that time I was supposed to
read the Constitution.

00:19:25.308 --> 00:19:28.618
I have not read it from cover
to cover.

00:19:28.618 --> 00:19:32.551
But anyway, I signed a contract
somewhat unseen--you

00:19:32.551 --> 00:19:36.640
know?--suspecting what the
contract is I'm signing.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.913
But most of you,
born in the States,

00:19:38.913 --> 00:19:40.473
never signed a contract.
 

00:19:40.473 --> 00:19:41.058
Right?
 

00:19:41.058 --> 00:19:42.792
It's still binding on you.
 

00:19:42.792 --> 00:19:43.259
Right?
 

00:19:43.259 --> 00:19:46.880
Unless you decide to abandon
the U.S.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.126
citizenship and become a
citizen of North Korea.

00:19:50.126 --> 00:19:50.680
Right?
 

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:54.180
Then you are bound by this
social contract.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:58.825
So that is, you know,
the difference between Hobbes

00:19:58.825 --> 00:20:01.519
and Locke, as we discussed.
 

00:20:01.519 --> 00:20:04.067
Now Rousseau,
as we will see,

00:20:04.067 --> 00:20:07.160
adds a new, interesting
element.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.673
He said, well,
it's not quite the individuals,

00:20:11.673 --> 00:20:16.390
and he introduces the notion of
general will.

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:22.325
There is a general will which
is well above the

00:20:22.325 --> 00:20:30.325
individuals--extremely important
idea, has a degree of insights

00:20:30.325 --> 00:20:32.390
and realism.
 

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:36.088
It's also a very dangerous idea.
 

00:20:36.088 --> 00:20:40.868
Totalitarian regimes very often
advocate it.

00:20:40.868 --> 00:20:48.736
General will that you--and I
will quote Jean Jacques for you

00:20:48.736 --> 00:20:54.058
when he said,
"the individuals will have

00:20:54.058 --> 00:20:59.967
to be forced to be free";
that follows from the idea of

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:01.278
general will.
 

00:21:01.278 --> 00:21:05.883
Well he's a complex thinker--
liberal on one hand,

00:21:05.883 --> 00:21:11.049
a contractarian on the other
hand, and paves the road to

00:21:11.049 --> 00:21:12.930
totalitarianism.
 

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:19.067
He was loved by many liberals,
and he was loved by many

00:21:19.067 --> 00:21:23.752
totalitarians--
like Karl Marx loved him,

00:21:23.752 --> 00:21:28.049
like Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
loved him,

00:21:28.049 --> 00:21:30.380
because of the general will.
 

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:35.250
But Durkheim loved him too,
and he was a liberal.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.980
So there he is.
 

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.990
Émile--I will
talk about this.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:42.733
I already mentioned,
any one of you,

00:21:42.733 --> 00:21:46.890
and there are probably a few
people who will end up in

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:51.358
education, you have to read this
book cover to cover.

00:21:51.358 --> 00:21:55.930
This is no modern major
education theory without the

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.348
book Émile.
 

00:21:58.348 --> 00:22:02.578
This is the foundation of
modern educational theory.

00:22:02.578 --> 00:22:08.795
Okay, he had a big impact:
a big impact on the American

00:22:08.795 --> 00:22:13.630
Constitution,
and the French Revolution.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:19.890
He's one of the path-breakers
on the French Revolution.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:25.865
He was also the first who
advocated popular sovereignty,

00:22:25.865 --> 00:22:31.515
the abolishment of the Third
Estate, and creating one

00:22:31.515 --> 00:22:34.013
popularly elected body.
 

00:22:34.013 --> 00:22:35.210
Right?
 

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:39.546
Strong conflict with
Montesquieu who wanted to have

00:22:39.546 --> 00:22:43.362
two chambers,
one for the aristocracy and one

00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:47.500
for the people;
Rousseau wanted to have one.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.890
Universal suffrage,
except for women;

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:54.338
well he was a male chauvinist
pig in one way.

00:22:54.338 --> 00:22:59.269
Well, and as we will see,
the idea of general will were

00:22:59.269 --> 00:23:04.200
picked up by the radicals of the
French Revolution,

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:09.346
the Jacobins,
and was picked up by later

00:23:09.346 --> 00:23:16.509
Communists of various types,
be it Leninists or Maoists.

00:23:16.509 --> 00:23:21.762
Well the general will and
French radicalism led to

00:23:21.762 --> 00:23:23.048
bloodshed.
 

00:23:23.048 --> 00:23:28.948
Robespierre,
the major disciple and believer

00:23:28.948 --> 00:23:35.670
of general will,
his head was also chopped off.

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:39.980
Well, so much about it.
 

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:43.130
Now Rousseau did not live the
French Revolution;

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.660
his ideas did, and informed it.
 

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:51.170
He had to move in '62 in exile
because both books created an

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:54.720
outrage, particularly by the
church.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:59.751
First he went back to Geneva,
but figured out he doesn't like

00:23:59.751 --> 00:24:01.430
Geneva any longer.
 

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:05.529
So David Hume,
the conservative philosopher

00:24:05.529 --> 00:24:10.900
who admired his work,
invited him to come to England.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:16.573
And like with everybody else
who was his friend,

00:24:16.573 --> 00:24:20.920
he had a fall-out with David
Hume.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.920
He was really a difficult guy,
right?

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.798
This is David Hume.
 

00:24:26.798 --> 00:24:32.387
And therefore he left England
and he returned to France--lived

00:24:32.387 --> 00:24:38.251
for a long time under an assumed
name to make sure he doesn't get

00:24:38.251 --> 00:24:39.808
into trouble.
 

00:24:39.808 --> 00:24:42.007
Finally, '68,
he married

00:24:42.007 --> 00:24:44.298
Thérèse.
 

00:24:44.298 --> 00:24:47.338
I will talk about this,
Émile.

00:24:47.338 --> 00:24:51.864
They had several children,
and the greatest educational

00:24:51.864 --> 00:24:55.550
theorist who tells you how to
raise children,

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:59.490
he put all of his children in
an orphanage.

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:02.930
He was a real bastard,
to put it another way.

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:09.646
And then he was writing his
Confessions,

00:25:09.646 --> 00:25:14.319
which was published
posthumously,

00:25:14.319 --> 00:25:19.140
and he died in '78,
July 2nd.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:25.349
So this is the author we will
be discussing today,

00:25:25.349 --> 00:25:31.180
and we will also be also
discussing Tuesday.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:38.957
And I hope I will have enough
time between I get home and

00:25:38.957 --> 00:25:46.363
before the limo comes,
so I can put this on the

00:25:46.363 --> 00:25:54.230
internet, so you can read this
on the internet.

00:25:54.230 --> 00:26:01.910
This is, if right,
the Social Contract.

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:06.549
Yes.
 

00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:11.930
Social Contract, 1782.
 

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:15.875
And I don't know why,
but I like to show you the

00:26:15.875 --> 00:26:21.164
first editions-- doesn't take me
too much time to find it on the

00:26:21.164 --> 00:26:24.440
internet, but occasionally it
does.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.970
Okay, so what the Social
Contract is all about?

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:34.287
Book I is a description how you
move from natural right--from

00:26:34.287 --> 00:26:38.710
the state of nature--to
political right.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:45.150
The second book is the
sovereign and how the sovereign

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:49.160
should be constructed,
created.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:53.763
This is an issue which Locke
did not pay much attention to.

00:26:53.763 --> 00:26:54.400
Right?
 

00:26:54.400 --> 00:27:00.644
We will see,
you know, Rousseau himself

00:27:00.644 --> 00:27:05.248
likes elected,
selected aristocracy,

00:27:05.248 --> 00:27:10.154
but he's beginning to think
about universal suffrage and a

00:27:10.154 --> 00:27:13.598
proper constitution of the
sovereign.

00:27:13.598 --> 00:27:19.202
Then he has a big section on
government, a section on ancient

00:27:19.202 --> 00:27:21.630
Rome and civil religion.
 

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:26.696
I will talk--well I don't have
much time--I will try to talk

00:27:26.696 --> 00:27:29.359
about civil religion as well.
 

00:27:29.359 --> 00:27:31.038
So what are the major themes?
 

00:27:31.038 --> 00:27:35.838
One question is what is
legitimate rule?

00:27:35.838 --> 00:27:41.660
And he said rule is only
legitimate when it is arrived at

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:42.700
consent.
 

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:49.115
But, he said,
justice has to be diluted

00:27:49.115 --> 00:27:55.529
because general will has to
prevail.

00:27:55.529 --> 00:28:00.230
I will have to talk a little
about justice being diluted.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:05.559
The problem is there is no
universal justice--what you can

00:28:05.559 --> 00:28:09.019
arrive at from the individual
will.

00:28:09.019 --> 00:28:15.307
There is a general will,
and a conception of the common

00:28:15.307 --> 00:28:18.669
good,
and the individual-- whether

00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:21.880
the individual is done justice
to,--

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:27.086
it has to be diluted,
it has to be restricted by the

00:28:27.086 --> 00:28:32.140
demands of the collective will,
of the collective good.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.440
Now this is a provocative
statement.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.038
It certainly has a kernel of
truth.

00:28:38.038 --> 00:28:43.462
It's also a very dangerous
argument because it opens up the

00:28:43.462 --> 00:28:47.914
rule for a totalitarian state,
which will tell you,

00:28:47.914 --> 00:28:50.848
"Oh, you think this is
your interest?

00:28:50.848 --> 00:28:54.088
What you think is your interest
is not really your interest.

00:28:54.088 --> 00:28:58.357
Me, the sovereign,
knows what is in your interest,

00:28:58.357 --> 00:29:01.318
and I will force you to be
free.

00:29:01.318 --> 00:29:05.368
I will force you to understand
what is in your interest."

00:29:05.368 --> 00:29:10.116
That is a bit of a tricky
argument which has been abused

00:29:10.116 --> 00:29:11.240
in history.
 

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:15.900
That's what the notion diluted
refers to.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:21.678
Now he advocates for popular
sovereignty and the need for

00:29:21.678 --> 00:29:23.019
convention.
 

00:29:23.019 --> 00:29:27.560
Well the argument is the
individual express only

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:33.797
individual interests,
and therefore the general will

00:29:33.797 --> 00:29:39.720
is not the will of--
not simply the sum total of

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.838
individual wills.
 

00:29:41.838 --> 00:29:46.373
He is a methodological
collectivist,

00:29:46.373 --> 00:29:49.868
as I already pointed out.
 

00:29:49.868 --> 00:29:52.910
And then it comes to the
lawgiver.

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:59.038
Well it is the lawgiver who
actually can inspire what he

00:29:59.038 --> 00:30:02.160
calls amour-propre.
 

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:07.630
You need a lawgiver--he sees
himself as a lawgiver--

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:13.916
who actually will be able to
tell you why your selfishness is

00:30:13.916 --> 00:30:17.596
no good--
why the love of your country

00:30:17.596 --> 00:30:21.386
and the community is the right
thing to go.

00:30:21.386 --> 00:30:22.108
Okay.
 

00:30:22.108 --> 00:30:27.778
And a good government means a
popularly elected legislature.

00:30:27.778 --> 00:30:32.272
And the executive is still by
an aristocracy,

00:30:32.272 --> 00:30:38.298
by the wise man--that's what he
really means by aristocracy,

00:30:38.298 --> 00:30:43.098
an intellectual aristocracy who
is elected.

00:30:43.098 --> 00:30:46.728
Well we have somewhat this
notion, that people in

00:30:46.728 --> 00:30:49.450
government should be smart,
right?

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:53.670
And we have a bit of concern
with--you know,

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:57.048
in the past there were some
presidents in the United States,

00:30:57.048 --> 00:31:01.307
some people in the United
States thought they are not all

00:31:01.307 --> 00:31:02.144
that smart.
 

00:31:02.144 --> 00:31:02.828
Right?
 

00:31:02.828 --> 00:31:07.364
I don't want to name names,
but you can think probably of

00:31:07.364 --> 00:31:12.060
some--why some people thought
they are a little on the dumb

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:12.788
side.
 

00:31:12.788 --> 00:31:18.815
And they did not earn very much
respect by those who think they

00:31:18.815 --> 00:31:20.369
are not smart.
 

00:31:20.369 --> 00:31:21.900
Anyway, that's it.
 

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.808
So legitimate rule.
 

00:31:24.808 --> 00:31:29.266
Well legitimate rule cannot be
based on natural title,

00:31:29.266 --> 00:31:30.778
not aristocracy.
 

00:31:30.778 --> 00:31:35.500
It has to be authorized by
consent.

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:41.017
Well I'll leave the family
issue, that's--family,

00:31:41.017 --> 00:31:45.500
he said, is the only natural
society.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:52.088
But he said even the family
does not come simply from

00:31:52.088 --> 00:31:53.230
nature.
 

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:56.900
There is a social contract in
the family,

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:02.813
and in fact when you grow
up--when you are not a small

00:32:02.813 --> 00:32:07.126
child anymore--
then you will realize how much

00:32:07.126 --> 00:32:08.818
of a contract it is.
 

00:32:08.818 --> 00:32:13.640
Eventually--I hope there is
nobody in this room,

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:19.077
but I suspect there are
probably a very few who at one

00:32:19.077 --> 00:32:24.752
point thought enough was enough;
you know, my mother and father

00:32:24.752 --> 00:32:27.795
is really a pain,
and therefore I don't want to

00:32:27.795 --> 00:32:30.571
do much with them--will break
the contract,

00:32:30.571 --> 00:32:31.298
right?
 

00:32:31.298 --> 00:32:34.338
It does happen to some people
in their life.

00:32:34.338 --> 00:32:37.240
As a father,
I hope it would never happen,

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.140
but unfortunately it
occasionally does.

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:44.661
When people are teenagers,
that's when you're beginning to

00:32:44.661 --> 00:32:49.500
think about the natural right of
the family as a contract,

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:53.141
and you're beginning to
enter--or some people begin to

00:32:53.141 --> 00:32:57.208
enter--
some kind of a new relationship

00:32:57.208 --> 00:33:03.325
in the parents and try to
convert the natural dependence

00:33:03.325 --> 00:33:09.108
on parents on a contractual
relationship saying,

00:33:09.108 --> 00:33:10.637
"Well how come?
 

00:33:10.637 --> 00:33:15.221
What do you mean I have to be
back home by eleven p.m.?"

00:33:15.221 --> 00:33:15.910
Right?
 

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:17.910
You remember that?
 

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:20.309
Anybody ever questioned that?
 

00:33:20.309 --> 00:33:20.890
Right?
 

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:22.778
Tried to negotiate it out.
 

00:33:22.778 --> 00:33:24.894
"Oh not eleven."
 

00:33:24.894 --> 00:33:27.009
You want it to be one a.m.
 

00:33:27.009 --> 00:33:27.660
Right?
 

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:32.400
"I am already sixteen or
seventeen."

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.029
You know?
 

00:33:34.029 --> 00:33:37.308
That's when you are converting
natural right.

00:33:37.308 --> 00:33:42.816
Okay, now there is a transition
from state of nature to the

00:33:42.816 --> 00:33:45.095
nature of civil society.
 

00:33:45.095 --> 00:33:45.950
Right?
 

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:54.088
Well there is the transition
from the state of nature to

00:33:54.088 --> 00:34:01.352
civil society is necessary--
this is a remarkable change,

00:34:01.352 --> 00:34:05.567
right?--
where you substitute justice

00:34:05.567 --> 00:34:11.974
for instinct of contact--
with morality which was lacking

00:34:11.974 --> 00:34:15.739
previously in the state of
nature.

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:21.168
And in civil society,
you know, we deprive ourselves

00:34:21.168 --> 00:34:27.449
from some of the advantages,
what we enjoyed in the state of

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:28.619
nature.
 

00:34:28.619 --> 00:34:31.896
Nevertheless,
this is a great progress,

00:34:31.896 --> 00:34:34.139
what has to be taken on.
 

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:37.460
We will see this also in
Émile.

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:46.690
Well, the second theme is about
the question of diluted justice.

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:51.043
And he said,
you know, the order to admit

00:34:51.043 --> 00:34:55.070
justice among us has to be
diluted.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:59.974
And diluted means,
you know, our individual sense

00:34:59.974 --> 00:35:05.389
of justice has to be overruled
by the general will.

00:35:05.389 --> 00:35:12.467
And a sovereign needs no
guarantor, and the individuals

00:35:12.467 --> 00:35:20.268
will have to be constrained;
otherwise we are in trouble.

00:35:20.268 --> 00:35:29.637
And here is the argument why
the individual will have to be

00:35:29.637 --> 00:35:31.900
constrained.
 

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:37.411
Individuals cannot just follow
their self-interests,

00:35:37.411 --> 00:35:42.059
because the general will have
to prevail.

00:35:42.059 --> 00:35:46.762
The common good has to overrule
the selfish individual

00:35:46.762 --> 00:35:52.085
interests--a very different type
of argument from the British

00:35:52.085 --> 00:35:53.239
liberals.
 

00:35:53.239 --> 00:35:58.297
Then he argues for popular
sovereignty, and he prefers to

00:35:58.297 --> 00:35:59.018
do so.
 

00:35:59.018 --> 00:36:05.119
And this is his single most
important contribution.

00:36:05.119 --> 00:36:10.606
This has to be based on a
convention, and a convention has

00:36:10.606 --> 00:36:15.130
to be arrived at by the rule of
the majority.

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:21.467
There must be an assembly of
people and--this is also a very

00:36:21.467 --> 00:36:26.945
radical, controversial
argument--that they must pool

00:36:26.945 --> 00:36:28.880
the resources.
 

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:34.163
It is almost a Communist idea
of having common property of

00:36:34.163 --> 00:36:38.518
major resources--a very
problematic argument.

00:36:38.518 --> 00:36:44.030
And he also makes this
interesting claim that in the

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:47.920
state of nature we are not
equal--

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.268
that's a very different view
from Hobbes--

00:36:51.268 --> 00:36:55.800
but we are being made equal by
convention,

00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:00.349
what we do with each other.
 

00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:05.336
And the problem is this is
really--does it lead to

00:37:05.336 --> 00:37:07.170
totalitarianism?
 

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:13.447
He's also advocating for public
possessions as a superior form

00:37:13.447 --> 00:37:18.489
of possession--state possession
over resources.

00:37:18.489 --> 00:37:22.806
A very problematic
argument--again paves the

00:37:22.806 --> 00:37:28.230
foundation towards Marxism and
Communist ideologies.

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:35.222
And well many of the--you know,
all the citations will be on

00:37:35.222 --> 00:37:37.000
the internet.
 

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.659
So you can read it much more
carefully than you can do it

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:42.159
now.
 

00:37:42.159 --> 00:37:46.730
Well then we arrive at the idea
of the general will.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:51.757
Individual--if this is
something, you believe in Adam

00:37:51.757 --> 00:37:56.126
Smith or you believe in Locke,
you will be very

00:37:56.126 --> 00:38:00.099
disturbed--individuals express
only private interest.

00:38:00.099 --> 00:38:03.260
So there must be a public
interest.

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:08.550
And the general will is sort
of--it's unclear where it is

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:13.938
coming from, but it is certainly
coming over and above the

00:38:13.938 --> 00:38:15.449
individuals.
 

00:38:15.449 --> 00:38:21.485
And this is the general will,
which is represented in what we

00:38:21.485 --> 00:38:23.900
call the commonwealth.
 

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:28.923
The federal authority,
the federal interest expresses

00:38:28.923 --> 00:38:30.760
the general will.
 

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.110
It is not the will of all.
 

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:37.472
It is the will which serves the
interests of everybody,

00:38:37.472 --> 00:38:40.380
rather than the view of
everybody.

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:44.342
Well, as I said,
you know, there is an element

00:38:44.342 --> 00:38:45.840
of truth to it.
 

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.690
In discussion sections we can
talk about this.

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:53.911
The class will be divided
whether this is acceptable or

00:38:53.911 --> 00:38:54.380
not.
 

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:59.692
But those of you who believe in
methodological collectivism will

00:38:59.692 --> 00:39:04.329
have to take very seriously the
idea of general will.

00:39:04.329 --> 00:39:07.702
And now comes the question of
the lawgivers,

00:39:07.702 --> 00:39:10.840
and this is a very important
argument.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:16.157
Well we are only free when we
obey the law.

00:39:16.157 --> 00:39:17.170
Right?
 

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:21.280
That freedom is under
self-imposed law.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:31.744
Hegel said that freedom is--you
are free when you recognize

00:39:31.744 --> 00:39:42.210
necessity, and therefore you
will have to go by the law.

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:46.494
And this will inspire
amour-propre,

00:39:46.494 --> 00:39:51.405
the love of the country,
rather than amour de

00:39:51.405 --> 00:39:54.750
soi, which is self-love.
 

00:39:54.750 --> 00:40:01.233
He makes this distinction
where--I'm afraid I will have to

00:40:01.233 --> 00:40:06.090
come back to this Tuesday;
I will have to leave it

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:10.447
now--the distinction between
amour-propre and amour

00:40:10.447 --> 00:40:13.860
de soi is a very important
distinction,

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:17.429
and I'll have to elaborate on
this Tuesday.

00:40:17.429 --> 00:40:22.447
So I will come back to
Social Contract,

00:40:22.447 --> 00:40:27.019
before we go on to
Émile.

00:40:27.019 --> 00:40:33.000

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:02.320
Professor John Merriman:
Well, I'm not working today.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.140
Moi, je chome aujourd'hui,
je ne fais rien.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.538
It's a great pleasure to have
my wonderful colleague and great

00:00:07.538 --> 00:00:10.446
friend Bruno Cabanes,
who is going to do give a

00:00:10.446 --> 00:00:13.830
lecture today on "The Great War,
Grief and Memory;"

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.626
and he's the author of a really
terrific book called,

00:00:17.626 --> 00:00:21.350
in English, Victory Plunged
into Mourning,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.315
on what happened at the end of
the war to the soldiers and to

00:00:26.315 --> 00:00:28.591
France.
And he has just published-- I

00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:31.601
just received it a few minutes
ago-- the Larousse de la

00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:34.802
Grande Guerre,
under his editorship,

00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:39.058
along with Anne Duménil.
Voilà,

00:00:39.058 --> 00:00:41.570
je te prête la machine
là.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.910
Professor Bruno Cabanes:
Thanks, John.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.964
This is my pleasure to give
this class today on the "The

00:00:55.964 --> 00:01:00.266
Great War, Grief and Memory."
As a kind of introduction I

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:04.597
would like to start with a book
that Sigmund Freud wrote in

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:08.780
1915, Thoughts for the Times
on War and Death.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.398
And according to me this is
probably one of the most

00:01:12.398 --> 00:01:16.157
fascinating works written on
mass death and collective

00:01:16.157 --> 00:01:19.581
mourning during the Great War.
Freud described,

00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:22.932
and I would like to quote,
"the complete collapse when

00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:25.840
death has struck down someone
whom we love,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.893
a parent or a partner in
marriage, a brother or a sister,

00:01:30.893 --> 00:01:35.161
a child or a close friend.
Our hopes," he says,

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:40.213
"our hopes, desires and our
pleasures lie in the grave with

00:01:40.213 --> 00:01:43.121
them.
We will not become souls,

00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:46.660
we will not fill the lost one's
place."

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.394
Actually, mass death and its
consequence, generalized

00:01:51.394 --> 00:01:56.129
mourning, appeared well before
the end of the war.

00:01:56.129 --> 00:02:00.691
To give you only one example,
around fifty percent of the

00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:05.497
French soldiers killed during
the Great War lost their lives

00:02:05.497 --> 00:02:10.303
in a seventeen-month period
between August 1914 and December

00:02:10.303 --> 00:02:12.659
1915.
Four years later,

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:16.264
in 1918/1919,
so in the immediate aftermath

00:02:16.264 --> 00:02:21.329
of war, death was basically
everywhere--the names written on

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.449
the war memorials built in the
early 1920s,

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:30.250
the black dresses of the war
widows, the empty spaces left by

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.932
so many young men,
all over Europe and all over

00:02:33.932 --> 00:02:35.613
the world.
We all know,

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:38.707
you all know,
from a demographic perspective

00:02:38.707 --> 00:02:43.645
how deadly the Great War was.
Around nine million soldiers

00:02:43.645 --> 00:02:48.258
killed: two million Germans,
1.8 million Russians,

00:02:48.258 --> 00:02:52.323
1.4 million French.
And to the dead of the Great

00:02:52.323 --> 00:02:56.593
War one must also add all those
killed by the pandemic of the

00:02:56.593 --> 00:03:01.007
Spanish flu--maybe two or three
times more murderous than World

00:03:01.007 --> 00:03:04.193
War I;
probably twenty million people

00:03:04.193 --> 00:03:08.840
were actually killed by the
Spanish flu epidemic in 1918.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.021
So, we all know these figures.
But, according to me,

00:03:12.021 --> 00:03:16.290
they mean nothing if one does
not consider them in the

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.560
relationship with private and
collective mourning;

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.080
and that's the topic of today's
class.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.187
Studying private and collective
mourning is, of course,

00:03:26.187 --> 00:03:29.180
much more difficult than
studying mass death from the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.539
perspective of historical
demography,

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:36.486
because most of the time this
personal, very personal,

00:03:36.486 --> 00:03:41.526
very intimate and family
experience of mourning has not

00:03:41.526 --> 00:03:45.019
left many sources.
So, the challenge for

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.995
historians is actually to grasp
the mourning process in its

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:52.080
reality,
something equivalent to what

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.405
the German sculptress Käthe
Kollwitz did when she made these

00:03:57.405 --> 00:04:01.400
two granite statues representing
her husband,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.658
Karl, and herself,
mourning their son Peter who

00:04:05.658 --> 00:04:11.490
was killed in Belgium near the
city of Ypres in October 1914.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.109
Of course, historians are not
sculptors, historians are not

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.426
artists, unfortunately.
So, how do we study private and

00:04:21.426 --> 00:04:25.515
collective mourning?
That's what I would like to

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:29.100
examine with you in this class.
In the first part of my

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.535
discussion I would like to--my
perspective will be rather

00:04:32.535 --> 00:04:35.340
general.
In the aftermath of World War

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.868
One, who were the people in
mourning, I will ask,

00:04:38.868 --> 00:04:41.440
and how many of them were
there?

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.758
But otherwise this question
touches on the possibility of

00:04:45.758 --> 00:04:49.690
studying what Jay Winter once
called "communities in

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.951
mourning,"
a very forward-looking concept

00:04:52.951 --> 00:04:57.170
that he's using mostly for Great
Britain and for the U.S.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.592
In the second part of this
class I will examine the

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:04.699
specificity of mourning in the
aftermath of World War One.

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.276
In doing so I hope to show you
that mourning can be studied

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:13.575
from a comparative perspective,
and that despite their

00:05:13.575 --> 00:05:17.969
personal, emotional dimensions,
war bereavements after the

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:22.439
Great War actually have some
characteristics in common.

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:25.542
And lastly, I will end my class
by examining the mourning

00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:28.802
process in itself,
and in doing so I would like to

00:05:28.802 --> 00:05:32.413
study the relationship between
personal suffering and

00:05:32.413 --> 00:05:35.119
collective mourning;
in other words,

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:39.040
the transformation of grief
into a cultural process.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.410
So, let's start with my first
point.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.389
Who were the persons in
mourning after World War One?

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:51.040
Well, from the perspective of
historical demographics this

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.630
question is actually a very
difficult one.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.422
Why?
Because in France,

00:05:57.422 --> 00:06:02.430
in the '20s and '30s,
war widows who remarried lost

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:08.540
their benefits and so simply
vanished from the statistics.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.373
And if you take the case of the
orphans, they got some help from

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:18.206
the French state when they were
children, but not when they came

00:06:18.206 --> 00:06:21.486
of age;
consequently the number you

00:06:21.486 --> 00:06:26.811
find in most textbooks of around
600,000 widows and at least

00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:32.406
760,00 orphans in France in the
1920s is of course only a rough

00:06:32.406 --> 00:06:35.824
estimate.
And this is not to mention the

00:06:35.824 --> 00:06:37.691
grandparents,
the brothers,

00:06:37.691 --> 00:06:39.629
the sisters,
the uncles,

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:43.524
the aunts, the nephews or
cousins who were in mourning,

00:06:43.524 --> 00:06:47.420
too, and sometimes expressed in
very moving diaries,

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.245
in very moving letters,
in very moving other sources

00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:55.160
their sufferings.
So, the concept of communities

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.893
in mourning, coined by Jay
Winter, is a very useful one as

00:06:59.893 --> 00:07:04.875
a means to grasp the scale of
mourning after World War One in

00:07:04.875 --> 00:07:08.924
its entirety.
Actually, every institution,

00:07:08.924 --> 00:07:14.125
every social structure went
into mourning in the aftermath

00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:17.284
of World War One.
The French high schools,

00:07:17.284 --> 00:07:19.008
the French
lycées,

00:07:19.008 --> 00:07:22.049
the French universities,
the French companies,

00:07:22.049 --> 00:07:25.934
the French businesses,
as well as let's say the French

00:07:25.934 --> 00:07:29.379
athletic clubs or the French
football teams,

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:33.697
the dead might have their names
inscribed in a number of

00:07:33.697 --> 00:07:37.356
places-- their schools,
their former colleges,

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:41.012
their parish churches.
The social structures were

00:07:41.012 --> 00:07:44.632
themselves communities of
mourning, were themselves

00:07:44.632 --> 00:07:48.758
composed of various groups
affected by mourning in varying

00:07:48.758 --> 00:07:51.953
degrees,
depending on their relationship

00:07:51.953 --> 00:07:55.079
with the deceased when he was
still alive.

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:57.950
And that's the second notion
that I would like actually to

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.519
introduce, what the French
historian Stéphane

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:03.389
Audoin-Rouzeau once called "the
circles of mourning."

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:09.533
The first circle of mourning
was composed of soldiers

00:08:09.533 --> 00:08:12.935
themselves.
For obvious reasons,

00:08:12.935 --> 00:08:17.224
on November 11th,
1918, the French Army was not

00:08:17.224 --> 00:08:22.259
only a victorious one but also
an army in mourning;

00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:26.879
mourning the dead as much as
rejoicing for victory.

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:30.648
What did the soldiers do on
Armistice Day,

00:08:30.648 --> 00:08:32.669
November 11th,
1918?

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:37.909
They first tried to find the
bodies of those who had been

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:43.352
abandoned in an immense land.
They buried them and they

00:08:43.352 --> 00:08:47.523
decorated with flowers the
wooden crosses,

00:08:47.523 --> 00:08:51.897
like this one,
that marked individual graves

00:08:51.897 --> 00:08:57.445
on the battlefields.
I wanted to quote a letter of a

00:08:57.445 --> 00:09:02.971
French soldier sent to his wife:
"my regiment has suffered

00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:06.985
terrible losses."
So, it was written on Armistice

00:09:06.985 --> 00:09:09.260
Day.
"My regiment has suffered

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.750
terrible losses.
Many of my friends have been

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.470
killed without ever knowing the
joy of victory.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:21.769
Thinking about those poor souls
I feel terrible."

00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:25.516
Those who are still waiting for
news from members of their

00:09:25.516 --> 00:09:29.460
family, who were still fighting,
wanted first to be reassured

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:34.051
before being able to rejoice.
Take the example of Henri

00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:40.057
Fauconnier, who volunteered in
the summer of 1914 at the age of

00:09:40.057 --> 00:09:43.188
thirty-five,
and whose fascinating

00:09:43.188 --> 00:09:48.062
correspondence with his young
fiancée Madeline has been

00:09:48.062 --> 00:09:51.568
published just a few years ago,
Lettres à

00:09:51.568 --> 00:09:53.087
Madeline.
And I quote,

00:09:53.087 --> 00:09:56.836
"how I am longing now to have
some news of Calot,

00:09:56.836 --> 00:10:00.742
of Jean," he wrote,
"I will not be completely happy

00:10:00.742 --> 00:10:04.119
until then."
And those who had lost friends,

00:10:04.119 --> 00:10:07.889
those who had lost brothers,
who also had lost comrades in

00:10:07.889 --> 00:10:11.701
arms during the war,
often expressed what has been

00:10:11.701 --> 00:10:15.021
later diagnosed as the
survivor's syndrome,

00:10:15.021 --> 00:10:20.000
a notion coined in the 1960s by
the psychiatrist Niederland.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.911
And here I would like to quote
Pierre Drieu la Rochelle in his

00:10:22.911 --> 00:10:24.964
novel La Comédie de
Charleroi,

00:10:24.964 --> 00:10:28.373
published just after the war.
"At certain moments I

00:10:28.373 --> 00:10:33.524
experienced a kind of shame,
as though I had torn the days I

00:10:33.524 --> 00:10:38.064
was enjoying now from those
young men whom I had left

00:10:38.064 --> 00:10:40.625
behind."
Guilt, shame,

00:10:40.625 --> 00:10:45.009
anxiety, sadness,
these were actually the

00:10:45.009 --> 00:10:50.820
feelings of most French soldiers
in November 1918.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.950
So, that's the first circle of
mourning.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:57.352
And this first circle of
mourning was actually in close

00:10:57.352 --> 00:11:02.162
contact with a second circle of
mourning, relatives of their

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:04.755
dead comrades.
The soldiers,

00:11:04.755 --> 00:11:08.739
as you may know,
used to inform the families of

00:11:08.739 --> 00:11:12.549
the precise location of the
burial place,

00:11:12.549 --> 00:11:16.294
including sometimes the
photographs, sometimes a map,

00:11:16.294 --> 00:11:20.615
sometimes a description so that
the bodies could be found and

00:11:20.615 --> 00:11:24.449
reburied after the war.
They described the dead

00:11:24.449 --> 00:11:28.475
soldier's last moments,
they described the funeral

00:11:28.475 --> 00:11:32.328
tribute that had been made.
Actually, in doing so,

00:11:32.328 --> 00:11:35.799
the first circle of mourning,
the small primary group,

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:41.093
worked as a kind of fictitious
family, a substitute for the

00:11:41.093 --> 00:11:46.659
relatives who were not present
when the soldier was killed.

00:11:46.659 --> 00:11:49.439
And the second circle of
mourning was composed of the

00:11:49.439 --> 00:11:51.470
soldier's parents,
the grandparents,

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.615
the children,
the wife and also larger family

00:11:55.615 --> 00:11:58.630
group, uncles,
aunts, cousins,

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.502
nieces, nephews.
Most of the time,

00:12:02.502 --> 00:12:06.463
I must admit,
this larger family group has

00:12:06.463 --> 00:12:12.163
been underestimated because
actually it appears in very rare

00:12:12.163 --> 00:12:14.796
sources.
And just to mention one of

00:12:14.796 --> 00:12:18.078
these very interesting sources,
that's the war diary written by

00:12:18.078 --> 00:12:20.090
the young Françoise
Marette.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.793
You probably don't know her,
but you know probably a name

00:12:23.793 --> 00:12:27.894
when she will become one of the
most famous child psychiatrists

00:12:27.894 --> 00:12:30.500
in France,
Françoise Dolto.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.566
So, the young Françoise
Marette had actually been

00:12:34.566 --> 00:12:38.706
educated in a very Catholic
family and she was brought up

00:12:38.706 --> 00:12:42.920
with the idea that she should
pray every day for her young

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:46.100
uncle who had been sent to the
front.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:50.472
So, she had been brought up
with the idea that in some ways

00:12:50.472 --> 00:12:53.765
it was her duty,
as a child, and I would say as

00:12:53.765 --> 00:12:56.024
a young girl,
which is not the same,

00:12:56.024 --> 00:12:58.789
as a young girl,
to do so.

00:12:58.789 --> 00:13:04.659
But it was actually her way to
take part in the conflict.

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:09.771
And, as you can imagine,
the death of her dear uncle

00:13:09.771 --> 00:13:14.583
adds a traumatic impact in the
life of this young

00:13:14.583 --> 00:13:20.128
Françoise Marette.
In a diary she presents herself

00:13:20.128 --> 00:13:24.214
comme une veuve de
guerre, as a war widow,

00:13:24.214 --> 00:13:28.639
and her grief is presented as a
personal tragedy.

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:31.860
So, that's a second circle of
mourning.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.079
And you've got actually a third
one, which is of course much

00:13:35.079 --> 00:13:38.080
more difficult to study,
which is made up of friends.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.429
I don't know if you will be
interested.

00:13:40.429 --> 00:13:43.967
I think the history of
friendship, especially the

00:13:43.967 --> 00:13:47.357
history of friendship in
wartime, is actually a

00:13:47.357 --> 00:13:51.190
fascinating one which still
needs to be written.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.935
So, if you have a theory or
something to write about that,

00:13:53.935 --> 00:13:56.392
it's a wonderful topic,
the history of friendship in

00:13:56.392 --> 00:13:58.524
wartime;
and especially from the

00:13:58.524 --> 00:14:01.429
perspective of her history of
bereavement.

00:14:01.429 --> 00:14:05.525
It has been only partially
studied for a small group of

00:14:05.525 --> 00:14:07.831
students;
in the English case for

00:14:07.831 --> 00:14:11.156
students from Oxford and
Cambridge, and in the French

00:14:11.156 --> 00:14:14.099
case for students from the
École Normale

00:14:14.099 --> 00:14:17.552
Supérieure who lost
actually hundreds of friends

00:14:17.552 --> 00:14:21.501
during the war,
and who used to write short but

00:14:21.501 --> 00:14:26.340
very personal biographies in the
École's year book.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.199
Take, for example,
this obituary written by the

00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:32.750
novelist Maurice Genevoix.
You must already know him,

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:36.509
he's one of the most famous
writers of the Great War.

00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:39.815
So, it was written by the
novelist Maurice Genevoix for

00:14:39.815 --> 00:14:43.120
one of his friends killed at the
age of twenty-five,

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.058
in January 1915,
and I quote,

00:14:46.058 --> 00:14:51.200
"what so often during those
long months of war,

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:57.149
and each engagement had created
voids around me.

00:14:57.149 --> 00:15:01.736
All the good friends at the
beginning whom I'd chosen,

00:15:01.736 --> 00:15:06.841
who had lightened my hours and
to whom I wanted to give back

00:15:06.841 --> 00:15:13.189
the strength they had given me,
had fallen, one after the one,

00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:17.947
all of them,
until I was alone in a crowd of

00:15:17.947 --> 00:15:22.759
indifferent men.
And among those whose support I

00:15:22.759 --> 00:15:27.480
wished for, to make this cult of
the dead more fervent,

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:32.549
was Benoit, dearest to my heart
and most valued friend.

00:15:32.549 --> 00:15:35.714
I said to myself,
'he, at least,

00:15:35.714 --> 00:15:39.029
will be saved.'
And I believed it.

00:15:39.029 --> 00:15:43.997
Then one morning in the white
hospital room the male orderly

00:15:43.997 --> 00:15:49.050
handed me a card and on this
card I read 'Benoit is dead.'

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:54.856
I felt a crushing sorrow.
I could not understand it,

00:15:54.856 --> 00:15:58.340
it did not make sense."
Well, of course,

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:02.331
this absence of meaning,
this absurdity can be explained

00:16:02.331 --> 00:16:06.540
by the experience of war itself
but it also leads us to the

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:10.241
second point I would like to
discuss with you today:

00:16:10.241 --> 00:16:13.217
the specificity,
if there is any,

00:16:13.217 --> 00:16:16.159
of the experience of World War
One.

00:16:16.159 --> 00:16:18.996
The first specificity,
according to me,

00:16:18.996 --> 00:16:23.027
is that for the first time
death in combat reversed the

00:16:23.027 --> 00:16:25.789
normal succession of
generations;

00:16:25.789 --> 00:16:29.395
and not on a limited scale,
rather on the scale of the

00:16:29.395 --> 00:16:32.457
whole generation,
la generation perdue,

00:16:32.457 --> 00:16:36.168
the lost generation.
There were often feelings of

00:16:36.168 --> 00:16:40.844
shame, feelings of guilt towards
the younger men who were almost

00:16:40.844 --> 00:16:44.629
exclusively bearing the burden
of war and death.

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:47.530
As my colleague Jay Winter
pointed out in a

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:51.397
thought-provoking article on
wartime demography published

00:16:51.397 --> 00:16:55.161
some years ago,
many older people in Paris,

00:16:55.161 --> 00:16:59.791
in London, in Berlin,
were suffering from depression

00:16:59.791 --> 00:17:04.619
during the Great War.
And you've got the very famous

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:09.829
case of the sociologist Emile
Durkheim, who died of grief;

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:14.960
he died of grief only one year
after his son's death in

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.253
December 1915.
So, the reverse of the normal

00:17:18.253 --> 00:17:21.190
succession of generations was
seen as shocking,

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:24.478
not only during the war,
not only in the immediate

00:17:24.478 --> 00:17:27.230
aftermath of war,
but also years later.

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:31.383
I want to quote an amazing page
from the last novel--you

00:17:31.383 --> 00:17:34.857
probably know it,
it's probably one of the most

00:17:34.857 --> 00:17:38.180
wonderful books written by
Albert Camus,

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.784
Le Premier Homme,
The First Man,

00:17:40.784 --> 00:17:42.809
a copy of which,
as you may know,

00:17:42.809 --> 00:17:47.184
was filmed in a briefcase near
the car in which the novelist

00:17:47.184 --> 00:17:50.430
died in January 1960,
at the age of forty-six.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:56.882
In 1953 Albert Camus made a
pilgrimage to the cemetery in

00:17:56.882 --> 00:18:01.902
Brittany where his father lay.
He filmed the grave,

00:18:01.902 --> 00:18:05.367
in the first row of the
military section of the Saint

00:18:05.367 --> 00:18:10.578
Michel Cemetery at Saint-Brieuc,
and there he read the date,

00:18:10.578 --> 00:18:15.055
and I quote,
"1885-1914," and automatically

00:18:15.055 --> 00:18:20.000
he did the arithmetic,
twenty-nine years.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.720
Suddenly he was struck by an
idea that shook his very being.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:30.785
He was forty-years-old.
The man buried under that slab

00:18:30.785 --> 00:18:35.579
who had been his father was
actually younger than him,

00:18:35.579 --> 00:18:39.773
and the wave of tenderness and
pity that once filled his heart

00:18:39.773 --> 00:18:44.173
was not the stirring of the soul
that leads the son to the memory

00:18:44.173 --> 00:18:48.892
of the vanished father,
but the overwhelming compassion

00:18:48.892 --> 00:18:53.970
that a grown man feels for an
unjustly murdered child;

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:57.704
something here was not in the
natural order,

00:18:57.704 --> 00:19:03.089
and in truth there was no order
but only madness and chaos when

00:19:03.089 --> 00:19:06.390
the son was older than the
father.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:09.761
Second specificity:
death was also experienced by

00:19:09.761 --> 00:19:12.430
the soldiers in a very solitary
way.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:17.289
Well, you'll tell me it's of
course very common in wartime.

00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:21.230
But here it must be seen
specifically in the light of

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:25.776
both the extreme violence of
this war and in the light of the

00:19:25.776 --> 00:19:30.549
religious rituals that were
still very important in France,

00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:33.240
before the outbreak of World
War One.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.844
One of the most striking fears
experienced by the soldiers of

00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:40.529
the Great War was of dying
alone,

00:19:40.529 --> 00:19:44.499
in the midst of an immense
land, abandoned by their

00:19:44.499 --> 00:19:48.390
comrades because of the violence
of the battle,

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:52.309
without a truce for
stretcher-bearers;

00:19:52.309 --> 00:19:56.460
or because the short,
unofficial truces were too

00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:01.581
precarious, soldiers who fell
wounded between the lines lay

00:20:01.581 --> 00:20:04.759
dying for hours,
sometimes days.

00:20:04.759 --> 00:20:09.455
According to the military
historian John Keegan,

00:20:09.455 --> 00:20:15.849
one-third of the 20,000 men who
died on the Somme on July 1st,

00:20:15.849 --> 00:20:21.025
1916, might have been saved had
the wounded soldiers been aided,

00:20:21.025 --> 00:20:25.789
as they probably would have
been half a century earlier.

00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:30.131
So, this fear of dying alone
was something many relatives

00:20:30.131 --> 00:20:33.309
actually imagined for their
loved ones,

00:20:33.309 --> 00:20:35.996
and which added,
of course, another torment to

00:20:35.996 --> 00:20:39.432
their bereavement.
Imaging their loved ones dying

00:20:39.432 --> 00:20:43.319
in almost animal solitude was
something unbearable.

00:20:43.319 --> 00:20:48.176
And I would like to quote a war
diary published in 1919 by a war

00:20:48.176 --> 00:20:52.029
widow: "He dies all alone over
there like a dog,

00:20:52.029 --> 00:20:56.370
and this horrible,
pitiful death we call death on

00:20:56.370 --> 00:21:00.625
the field of honor.
He will lie for days and days

00:21:00.625 --> 00:21:05.498
forgotten, on the bare earth,
with a smashed skull and chest,

00:21:05.498 --> 00:21:10.210
and German crows will steal
away his dearest memories."

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:15.149
Obviously, this solitary death
was all the more unbearable as

00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:19.841
dying was not the socially
invisible reality it has become

00:21:19.841 --> 00:21:24.598
in the late twentieth century,
but something accepted,

00:21:24.598 --> 00:21:29.793
something experienced at home,
in the company of relatives and

00:21:29.793 --> 00:21:32.993
friends.
And if you want to understand

00:21:32.993 --> 00:21:37.365
this process you have to read
the work by the sociologist

00:21:37.365 --> 00:21:41.190
Norbert Elias which is probably
his last book,

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:45.463
published I think in 1982,
The Loneliness of Dying,

00:21:45.463 --> 00:21:49.362
in which he presents this
process from once again the

00:21:49.362 --> 00:21:54.010
death experienced at home to a
kind of invisible and a solitary

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:57.980
death we experience right now,
today.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.277
So, before World War One only
those who had no family,

00:22:01.277 --> 00:22:04.762
only those who had no home,
will die alone or will die in

00:22:04.762 --> 00:22:08.773
the hospital.
The funeral vigil was also very

00:22:08.773 --> 00:22:14.300
important and a very respected
ritual in a Catholic country

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.457
like France.
Industrialized warfare,

00:22:17.457 --> 00:22:20.686
World War One,
changed this tradition in the

00:22:20.686 --> 00:22:23.690
most violent and the most brutal
way.

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:29.199
All the stages-- and they are
very important--all the stages

00:22:29.199 --> 00:22:34.429
that used to prepare a person
for bereavement were simply

00:22:34.429 --> 00:22:37.508
eliminated.
All the rituals that in

00:22:37.508 --> 00:22:41.888
ordinary life accompanied the
first moments of loss were also

00:22:41.888 --> 00:22:46.334
eliminated.
The first specificity was the

00:22:46.334 --> 00:22:51.883
absence of the dead bodies
during World War One,

00:22:51.883 --> 00:22:58.962
and that for two main reasons.
The first one was the complete

00:22:58.962 --> 00:23:05.116
destruction of around thirty
percent of those killed during

00:23:05.116 --> 00:23:10.049
the Great War,
whose bodies were destroyed by

00:23:10.049 --> 00:23:14.640
the explosions and could not be
identified.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:21.216
In the context of total war,
direct heat from large-caliber

00:23:21.216 --> 00:23:28.359
shells could literally pulverize
the body, leaving absolutely no

00:23:28.359 --> 00:23:31.643
remains;
hence the great number of

00:23:31.643 --> 00:23:34.720
missing in action during the
Great War.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.792
If you want to understand the
experience of shelling and if

00:23:38.792 --> 00:23:42.303
you want to understand the
psychological sufferings

00:23:42.303 --> 00:23:46.746
inflicted to the soldiers,
you must read what the Jesuit

00:23:46.746 --> 00:23:49.485
Paul Dubreuil,
a veteran of Verdun,

00:23:49.485 --> 00:23:53.029
wrote about the Battle of
Verdun in 1916,

00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:56.971
and I quote,
"when one heard the whistle in

00:23:56.971 --> 00:24:02.321
the distance one's whole body
contracted to resist the two

00:24:02.321 --> 00:24:07.390
excessively important vibrations
of the explosion,

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:12.109
and at each repetition it was a
new attack, a new fatigue,

00:24:12.109 --> 00:24:16.051
a new suffering.
Under this regime the most

00:24:16.051 --> 00:24:19.539
solid nerves cannot resist for
long.

00:24:19.539 --> 00:24:23.690
Perhaps the best comparison is
that of seasickness,

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:27.923
and that's my point,
to die from bullets seems to be

00:24:27.923 --> 00:24:31.394
nothing.
Parts of our being remain

00:24:31.394 --> 00:24:35.749
intact but to be dismembered,
torn to pieces,

00:24:35.749 --> 00:24:40.058
reduced to pulp,
this is a fear that flesh

00:24:40.058 --> 00:24:44.914
cannot support and which is
fundamentally the great

00:24:44.914 --> 00:24:50.220
suffering of the bombardment."
But there is also another

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:54.923
reason for the absence of dead
bodies which is often less

00:24:54.923 --> 00:24:59.021
known.
After 1918, the bodies remained

00:24:59.021 --> 00:25:04.194
on the battlefields,
until the French governments

00:25:04.194 --> 00:25:08.289
gave permission to repatriate
them.

00:25:08.289 --> 00:25:13.073
But this did not happen before
a special decree was passed in

00:25:13.073 --> 00:25:17.220
1920, so two years after the end
of World War One.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:22.286
Why did it take so much time to
allow the French families to get

00:25:22.286 --> 00:25:26.789
their loved one's bodies back
home for private burial?

00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:30.033
Nobody knows,
but the enormous amount of

00:25:30.033 --> 00:25:34.357
energy many French families
spent to have this decree

00:25:34.357 --> 00:25:39.181
finally signed shows in itself
the psychological sufferings

00:25:39.181 --> 00:25:43.089
caused by distance and prolonged
absence.

00:25:43.089 --> 00:25:46.490
Well, that's something we all
know from everyday life.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:50.208
For example,
in the case of the sailors lost

00:25:50.208 --> 00:25:55.309
at sea or from recent events,
for example the victims of the

00:25:55.309 --> 00:25:59.897
9/11 attacks,
ending the mourning process

00:25:59.897 --> 00:26:04.400
without having seen,
touched, or kissed,

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.500
or buried a body,
is extremely difficult,

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.119
almost impossible.
And that's actually something

00:26:12.119 --> 00:26:16.398
thousands and thousands of
families experienced after World

00:26:16.398 --> 00:26:18.960
War One.
That's also something the

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.160
French politician Louis Barthou
explained before the National

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.380
Commission on Military Burials
on May 31st,

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:30.031
1919, when the government,
the French government still

00:26:30.031 --> 00:26:33.200
opposed the return of the
soldiers' remains.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.487
And I quote,
"fine, it's all very well to

00:26:36.487 --> 00:26:40.349
say that our children will be
equal in death.

00:26:40.349 --> 00:26:45.503
But I don't see what principle
of equality requires that a hard

00:26:45.503 --> 00:26:50.740
and fast rule be established as
far as families is concerned.

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:54.693
Where is my son?
He was killed in 1914,

00:26:54.693 --> 00:26:57.710
five years ago.
He's in a tomb.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:01.839
His mother and I are waiting
for him.

00:27:01.839 --> 00:27:05.952
And because horrors have not
been found you tell me that you

00:27:05.952 --> 00:27:09.020
forbid me to take my son and
bring him to the

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:13.155
Père-Lachaise Cemetery,"
which is, as you may know one

00:27:13.155 --> 00:27:15.259
of the largest cemeteries in
Paris.

00:27:15.259 --> 00:27:18.950
"Well, I tell you that you have
no right to do so.

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:22.446
You explain it by saying that
hundreds of thousands of

00:27:22.446 --> 00:27:26.470
soldiers have been killed and
you have not identified them.

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:30.560
But mine was.
You speak of identification.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:35.279
Well mine was identified.
Of the transportation shortage;

00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:39.670
but I can bring back my son on
my own, without asking anything

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:43.381
of the government.
This is not what I understand

00:27:43.381 --> 00:27:47.768
by equality and I think the
proposed government bill is a

00:27:47.768 --> 00:27:49.865
mistake.
That's why I,

00:27:49.865 --> 00:27:52.809
for my part,
won't accept it."

00:27:52.809 --> 00:27:57.688
As a consequence of the
specificities I have just

00:27:57.688 --> 00:28:03.481
presented, the mourning process
after World War One was an

00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:07.750
incredibly difficult and
tortuous one,

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:12.467
and it gave birth to a new
commemorative activity,

00:28:12.467 --> 00:28:16.607
new languages,
new rituals that I would like

00:28:16.607 --> 00:28:20.170
to present now in my third
point.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:25.491
Up to now I've addressed the
notion of grief from the

00:28:25.491 --> 00:28:29.380
perspective of personal
bereavement.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:33.811
But the expense of mass death,
the absence of so many dead

00:28:33.811 --> 00:28:38.475
bodies, the violence of the war
experience itself also needed

00:28:38.475 --> 00:28:43.217
new forms of representation so
that the dead soldiers could be

00:28:43.217 --> 00:28:47.960
remembered and so that a tribute
could be paid to them.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.208
That's what Stéphane
Andoin-Rouzeau and Annette

00:28:52.208 --> 00:28:55.494
Becker explain in their book
1914-1918,

00:28:55.494 --> 00:28:58.380
Understanding the Great
War.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:03.169
The words spoken at ceremonies,
the images offered in

00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:07.130
inscriptions and commemorative
monuments,

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:12.091
the stained-glass windows,
the cemeteries and usuries have

00:29:12.091 --> 00:29:15.889
lasted to this day,
and through them we as

00:29:15.889 --> 00:29:20.812
historians can recall these
endless commemorations where

00:29:20.812 --> 00:29:26.630
political liturgy and private
bereavements were complementary.

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:31.003
Political liturgy ends private
bereavement, in other words

00:29:31.003 --> 00:29:34.150
collective mourning and personal
grief.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:37.324
My point here is not to present
you, of course,

00:29:37.324 --> 00:29:41.190
the war of commemorative
activity after World War One;

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:44.230
that will be almost impossible
and useless.

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:48.489
I would prefer to focus on two
major cultural processes that

00:29:48.489 --> 00:29:52.387
deal with the transformation of
the personal grief into

00:29:52.387 --> 00:29:57.386
collective mourning.
The first one can be presented

00:29:57.386 --> 00:30:01.960
as a kind of nationalization of
mourning.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:10.175
In the 1920s and 1930s the
battlefields were converted into

00:30:10.175 --> 00:30:19.099
commemorative sites through a
network of military cemeteries,

00:30:19.099 --> 00:30:24.747
landscaped memorial parks,
and large battlefield

00:30:24.747 --> 00:30:29.624
monuments.
A kind of war tourism appeared

00:30:29.624 --> 00:30:36.950
during the conflict itself and
develops in the 1920s and 1930s;

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:41.112
just refer, if you're
interested by that topic,

00:30:41.112 --> 00:30:44.460
to the book written by David
Lloyd,

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.958
Battlefield Tourism:
Pilgrimage and the

00:30:46.958 --> 00:30:49.640
Commemoration of the Great War
in Britain,

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:53.940
Australia and Canada,
published in 1998.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.885
These new sites of memory,
or to use the famous

00:30:56.885 --> 00:30:59.190
terminology coined by Pierre
Nora,

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:01.768
these new lieux de
mémoire,

00:31:01.768 --> 00:31:04.089
were often represented on
objects,

00:31:04.089 --> 00:31:08.276
paintings and pictures,
and a number of ceremonies were

00:31:08.276 --> 00:31:11.299
organized to pay tribute to the
dead,

00:31:11.299 --> 00:31:13.759
especially on Armistice Day
each year.

00:31:13.759 --> 00:31:16.839
And that's an object which I
like very much.

00:31:16.839 --> 00:31:21.062
It's a bit kitsch,
of course, but it's the usury

00:31:21.062 --> 00:31:23.577
in Douaumont,
so near Verdun,

00:31:23.577 --> 00:31:27.710
in Verdun, which is represented
on a tray.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:30.860
Can you imagine to have that at
home all the time?

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:36.204
Anyway, it's on a tray.
And you see exactly what

00:31:36.204 --> 00:31:42.887
Douaumont is about.
It's a huge necropolis which

00:31:42.887 --> 00:31:49.352
was inaugurated in summer 1932.
It's aim was at the same time

00:31:49.352 --> 00:31:54.717
to bring together most of the
identified bodies of the Battle

00:31:54.717 --> 00:31:59.545
of Verdun.
The cemetery here contains more

00:31:59.545 --> 00:32:04.495
than 15,000 bodies.
And the other aim was to

00:32:04.495 --> 00:32:10.312
contain the remains of those who
remained unidentified,

00:32:10.312 --> 00:32:15.160
estimated as here,
estimated 32,000 inside the

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:20.550
building, 32,000.
So, the cemetery which appears

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:26.289
also in the famous 1937 remake
of J'accuse! by Abel

00:32:26.289 --> 00:32:30.530
Gance where dead soldiers,
here the cemetery,

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:35.006
rise from it--can you imagine
that, too?--arise from the grave

00:32:35.006 --> 00:32:38.160
in Douaumont,
at the Douaumont Cemetery to

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.130
haunt the living and prevent
another war.

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:44.180
That's really a fascinating
film.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:47.475
So, the cemetery,
this cemetery of Douaumont,

00:32:47.475 --> 00:32:51.069
and three other ones at Notre
Dame de Lorette,

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:53.825
in the Pas-de-Calais,
at Douaumont,

00:32:53.825 --> 00:32:57.309
the Marne, and at [inaudible],
in Alsace,

00:32:57.309 --> 00:33:01.267
became places of family
pilgrimage for those who had

00:33:01.267 --> 00:33:05.690
lost a relative or for those who
had no grave to go to.

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:10.222
According to me,
all these commemorative sites

00:33:10.222 --> 00:33:16.266
of memory must be considered in
the perspective of the French

00:33:16.266 --> 00:33:19.765
national unity.
The sites of memory which

00:33:19.765 --> 00:33:23.190
became sites of mourning for the
whole French nation,

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:27.963
like this one,
Douaumont, and also the 36,000

00:33:27.963 --> 00:33:34.473
war memorials built in each of
the 36,000 communes into which

00:33:34.473 --> 00:33:39.789
France was divided-- in every
French commune.

00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:45.548
So, even in the smallest
village, the same day of the

00:33:45.548 --> 00:33:49.646
year, November 11th,
at the same hour,

00:33:49.646 --> 00:33:54.630
11 a.m., the mayor used to name
the dead.

00:33:54.630 --> 00:34:00.653
For the lost generation,
a new entity was created that

00:34:00.653 --> 00:34:06.904
obeyed the classical precepts of
tragedy--unity of time,

00:34:06.904 --> 00:34:12.139
November 11th;
unity of space, the memorials;

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:15.909
unity of action,
the commemorative ceremony.

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:19.516
Naming the dead served,
as you can imagine,

00:34:19.516 --> 00:34:24.410
another important function for
the living-- inscribing the

00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:29.314
names of the dead,
reading them and then touching

00:34:29.314 --> 00:34:35.643
the inscription served to bring
the dead out of the anonymity of

00:34:35.643 --> 00:34:38.912
mass death.
And if you've been to

00:34:38.912 --> 00:34:43.612
Washington, DC you know that
it's exactly what happens

00:34:43.612 --> 00:34:47.677
nowadays with the VVM,
with the Vietnam Veterans

00:34:47.677 --> 00:34:50.855
Memorial in Washington DC,
made by Maya Lin,

00:34:50.855 --> 00:34:55.290
where the Vietnam Vets go to
touch the inscriptions and mourn

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:58.273
their comrades in arms.
Le lieu de

00:34:58.273 --> 00:35:01.788
mémoire,
the oversight of memory related

00:35:01.788 --> 00:35:04.739
to this nationalization of
mourning is,

00:35:04.739 --> 00:35:08.835
of course, the commemorative
invention par excellence of the

00:35:08.835 --> 00:35:11.960
Great War, the cult of the
Unknown Soldier.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:15.919
In most countries,
except Germany and except

00:35:15.919 --> 00:35:21.720
Russia, the cult of the Unknown
Soldier was extremely popular in

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.941
the 1920s.
It appeared almost at the same

00:35:24.941 --> 00:35:27.130
time in Paris and London in
1920;

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:31.579
in Washington,
DC, Rome and Brussels in 1921;

00:35:31.579 --> 00:35:35.210
and in Prague and Belgrade in
1922.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:37.065
But, of course,
I would like to focus on the

00:35:37.065 --> 00:35:40.449
French case.
What happens in November 1920?

00:35:40.449 --> 00:35:44.570
On November 10th,
1920, the Unknown Soldier's

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:49.719
coffin arrived in Paris by
special train from Verdun.

00:35:49.719 --> 00:35:53.535
The coffin was placed for one
night--and every step is

00:35:53.535 --> 00:35:57.710
important--the coffin was placed
for one night at the Place

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:01.309
Denfert-Rochereau which is of
course symbolic;

00:36:01.309 --> 00:36:03.965
and you know probably why,
because it was named,

00:36:03.965 --> 00:36:08.608
the Place Denfert-Rochereau,
was named for a heroic French

00:36:08.608 --> 00:36:12.879
commander of 1871,
and so it symbolized the

00:36:12.879 --> 00:36:17.150
revenge of the French over the
Germans.

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:19.641
The next day,
November 11th,

00:36:19.641 --> 00:36:24.809
1920, the Unknown Soldier was
brought to the Pantheon,

00:36:24.809 --> 00:36:28.576
which was first considered the
natural place to bury it,

00:36:28.576 --> 00:36:32.480
because as you may know it's
the burial place dedicated to

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:36.218
the nation's great men.
But according to most veterans

00:36:36.218 --> 00:36:39.304
the Unknown Soldier was not
un grand homme,

00:36:39.304 --> 00:36:42.829
was not a great man in the
usual meaning of the word.

00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:46.473
So, after a brief ceremony at
the Pantheon the coffin was

00:36:46.473 --> 00:36:51.209
brought to the Arc de Triomphe.
It had been draped with the

00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:56.099
French flag, it had been placed
on a gun carriage,

00:36:56.099 --> 00:37:00.432
and it was surrounded by
mutilated veterans who were

00:37:00.432 --> 00:37:06.039
there to symbolize the destroyed
man and the destroyed families.

00:37:06.039 --> 00:37:09.115
Furthermore,
and this is my point,

00:37:09.115 --> 00:37:14.707
the coffin was also accompanied
by a fictitious family--a war

00:37:14.707 --> 00:37:18.150
widow,
a mother and father who had

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:24.099
lost a son, and a child who had
lost his father during the war.

00:37:24.099 --> 00:37:29.241
This as if each French man,
each French woman,

00:37:29.241 --> 00:37:35.296
was to adopt the Unknown
Soldier as a member of his or

00:37:35.296 --> 00:37:39.292
her family.
And the ceremonies of November

00:37:39.292 --> 00:37:44.084
11th, 1920, brought hundreds of
thousands of weeping people into

00:37:44.084 --> 00:37:48.330
the streets of Paris,
many encouraged to believe that

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:53.093
the coffin that passed actually
before them contained the body

00:37:53.093 --> 00:37:56.387
of the man they had lost.
In other words,

00:37:56.387 --> 00:38:00.521
the Unknown Soldier was the
dead relative of every French

00:38:00.521 --> 00:38:03.691
family,
as well as a symbol of the loss

00:38:03.691 --> 00:38:07.219
experienced by the French nation
as a whole.

00:38:07.219 --> 00:38:10.000
So, that's also a kind of
nationalization of mourning.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.719
Nationalization of mourning,
but also--and this is the

00:38:14.719 --> 00:38:19.972
second major cultural process--a
kind of spiritualization of

00:38:19.972 --> 00:38:23.379
mourning.
Well, I could give you many

00:38:23.379 --> 00:38:28.710
examples of the spiritual flavor
that characterized the 1920s and

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:31.465
1930s.
I could also discuss,

00:38:31.465 --> 00:38:37.289
as Jay Winter did remarkably in
his book Sites of Memory,

00:38:37.289 --> 00:38:40.871
Sites of Mourning,
whether the spirituality of the

00:38:40.871 --> 00:38:44.926
Great War and of the aftermath
of the Great War was something

00:38:44.926 --> 00:38:48.913
new or something rooted in the
European religious traditions

00:38:48.913 --> 00:38:51.969
and rituals.
I will only give you one

00:38:51.969 --> 00:38:55.420
emblematic example,
and actually I will end my

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:59.937
presentation with it.
This is the case of Maurice

00:38:59.937 --> 00:39:05.788
Gallais--that's the portrait
here--a young officer cadet who

00:39:05.788 --> 00:39:09.528
died in Bouchavesne,
on the Somme,

00:39:09.528 --> 00:39:15.250
on September 25th,
1916, at the age of twenty-two.

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:19.822
Actually, he was sent on a
reconnaissance mission and,

00:39:19.822 --> 00:39:24.571
as he was just back from leave,
he probably didn't know the

00:39:24.571 --> 00:39:28.725
area very well and lost his way,
and he was shot by a German

00:39:28.725 --> 00:39:32.248
patrol.
Maurice was the only child of

00:39:32.248 --> 00:39:37.012
Berthe and Auguste Gallais,
who owned a factory in

00:39:37.012 --> 00:39:41.677
Creil--that's in
département of the

00:39:41.677 --> 00:39:43.954
Oise,
close to Paris,

00:39:43.954 --> 00:39:47.000
only thirty kilometers from
Paris.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.719
He was unmarried,
had only a few relatives.

00:39:50.719 --> 00:39:54.814
His immediate family included
probably seven people,

00:39:54.814 --> 00:39:58.427
and his death was,
of course, experienced as a

00:39:58.427 --> 00:40:02.039
terrible emotional shock for all
of them.

00:40:02.039 --> 00:40:06.703
It actually took almost six
months before Maurice Gallais's

00:40:06.703 --> 00:40:10.803
parents received the
confirmation that their son had

00:40:10.803 --> 00:40:14.208
been killed.
He was first considered missing

00:40:14.208 --> 00:40:18.309
in action, and his body was
identified only in spring 1917.

00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:23.619
Berthe and Auguste Gallais
could not wait until the end of

00:40:23.619 --> 00:40:28.182
the war to see the place where
their son, Maurice,

00:40:28.182 --> 00:40:31.430
was buried.
Despite the obvious danger,

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:34.651
despite the restrictions
imposed by the military

00:40:34.651 --> 00:40:37.520
authorities,
they drove to Bouchavesne,

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:41.273
in 1917--can you imagine that,
in 1917?--they drove to

00:40:41.273 --> 00:40:45.379
Bouchavesne as soon as they
could and they took pictures of

00:40:45.379 --> 00:40:49.739
the temporary grave.
In 1922, almost four years

00:40:49.739 --> 00:40:54.519
after the armistice,
they decided to bury Maurice

00:40:54.519 --> 00:40:58.157
for the second time.
Auguste Gallais,

00:40:58.157 --> 00:41:01.948
his father, wrote to the mayor
of Bouchavesne,

00:41:01.948 --> 00:41:07.002
and convinced him to build a
huge roadside cross dedicated to

00:41:07.002 --> 00:41:10.539
the memory of the men of
Bouchavesne,

00:41:10.539 --> 00:41:13.219
and dedicated to Maurice
himself.

00:41:13.219 --> 00:41:18.031
So, as you can see at this
stage the personal grief is

00:41:18.031 --> 00:41:23.570
already deeply inter-twined with
the public collective one.

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:32.563
In 1922 Berthe Gallais decided
also to transform Maurice's room

00:41:32.563 --> 00:41:39.006
into a kind of mausoleum.
Some ground from the

00:41:39.006 --> 00:41:46.207
battlefield, from the Somme,
was brought back to Creil and

00:41:46.207 --> 00:41:51.260
exposed in a room,
along with--I don't know if you

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:55.907
can see that here clearly--with
fragments of shells and other

00:41:55.907 --> 00:41:58.849
material souvenir of the Great
War.

00:41:58.849 --> 00:42:04.311
Behind the cabinet's window,
Maurice Gallais' uniform with

00:42:04.311 --> 00:42:08.909
the ruby-red pants of 1914,
some photographs here

00:42:08.909 --> 00:42:14.333
representing the young man.
It's a curious gathering of

00:42:14.333 --> 00:42:19.514
personal belongings and remains
from the war which reveal,

00:42:19.514 --> 00:42:23.150
according to me,
a kind of fetishism.

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:26.794
But that's not all.
In this room,

00:42:26.794 --> 00:42:32.952
transformed into a kind of
chapel, Maurice was represented

00:42:32.952 --> 00:42:36.949
like a saint who had saved
France;

00:42:36.949 --> 00:42:39.496
and as his own grandmother
wrote in a prayer,

00:42:39.496 --> 00:42:42.216
the whole universe,
l'univers entier--not

00:42:42.216 --> 00:42:44.590
only France, l'univers
entier.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:49.585
Maurice's personal belongings
were described by Berthe

00:42:49.585 --> 00:42:54.110
Gallais, his mother,
as some religious relics.

00:42:54.110 --> 00:43:00.294
And this is actually what many,
many Catholic French people

00:43:00.294 --> 00:43:04.538
felt in the '20s and '30s.
At this time,

00:43:04.538 --> 00:43:08.893
as my colleague,
Annette Becker is explaining,

00:43:08.893 --> 00:43:13.349
in one of her books,
the Christian soldier was

00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:18.522
likened in his sacrifice to
Christ in a kind of imitatio

00:43:18.522 --> 00:43:21.837
christi,
and his mother to a new Virgin

00:43:21.837 --> 00:43:26.522
Mary, a mater dolorosa.
Until her death in 1927,

00:43:26.522 --> 00:43:32.909
Maurice Gallais's grandmother
went every day to the room,

00:43:32.909 --> 00:43:36.699
and recited the prayer she had
composed for him,

00:43:36.699 --> 00:43:41.780
thanking God for having given
her such a courageous grandson,

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:44.111
"parce que vous l'avec
accordé

00:43:44.111 --> 00:43:47.099
la plus belle des morts et
ouvert votre paradis,

00:43:47.099 --> 00:43:50.720
où je l'imagine comme un
saint"--like a saint--"je

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.503
vous remercie,
Signor",

00:43:52.503 --> 00:43:57.557
the prayer says at the end.
Well, when did the mourning

00:43:57.557 --> 00:44:02.787
process end?
Is the war of 1914/1918 over,

00:44:02.787 --> 00:44:09.671
as many felt in the early
1990s, after the fall of the

00:44:09.671 --> 00:44:13.085
Wall of Berlin?
Paradoxically,

00:44:13.085 --> 00:44:17.234
in the last few years we have
witnessed a new emotional

00:44:17.234 --> 00:44:20.999
investment in the conflict,
the first and the fourth

00:44:20.999 --> 00:44:24.649
generation, the generations of
the veterans' grandchildren or

00:44:24.649 --> 00:44:27.204
great-grandchildren--my
generation and your

00:44:27.204 --> 00:44:30.792
generation--are more and more
aware of the importance of the

00:44:30.792 --> 00:44:34.260
Great War in the history of the
twentieth century,

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.717
and the First World War tends
to be ever more present in the

00:44:37.717 --> 00:44:41.137
minds of successive generations.
According to most historians,

00:44:41.137 --> 00:44:44.090
and according especially to
Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau,

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:49.651
this renewed interest in the
1990s is related to the

00:44:49.651 --> 00:44:55.956
unfinished process of mourning,
and actually explains that by

00:44:55.956 --> 00:45:01.090
the number of many missing in
action in World War One.

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:05.481
At the end of the 1920s,
after the death of Maurice's

00:45:05.481 --> 00:45:10.547
father, Berthe Gallais decided
to transform her house so that

00:45:10.547 --> 00:45:14.770
it could be transformed into a
kind of museum.

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:20.153
So, she was living--she moved.
She lived in a small house just

00:45:20.153 --> 00:45:25.070
opposite what had become the
Musée Maurice Gallais,

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:29.159
founded in the 1930s;
and she died in 1956.

00:45:29.159 --> 00:45:35.212
Was this transformation of the
house into a museum a way for

00:45:35.212 --> 00:45:40.239
her to show that the mourning
process was over,

00:45:40.239 --> 00:45:44.973
or on the contrary was it a way
to prolong the mourning process

00:45:44.973 --> 00:45:48.717
eternally?
Anyway, after so many years

00:45:48.717 --> 00:45:55.419
Maurice's room remains unchanged
as a kind of private chapel in a

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:58.000
public museum.
Thanks.

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.080
Prof: Okay,
I need two volunteers here at

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.040
the beginning,
while we're waiting for

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.630
everybody else to come in.
 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.460
You have to come up here and do
something.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.230
Come on up.
 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.550
Okay.
 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.020
So each of you -- actually I
don't want two people that are

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.830
sitting together.
 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.800
So Lucas, you;
and Julia stay.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.970
But Rick, why don't you come up?
 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.020
So here, come here, come here.
 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.400
So your job is to grind -- this
is a spice -- so you grind it up

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.619
good, and then we're going to
take it back and show it to the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:42.130
people around you;
we're going to smell it.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.210
Okay?
 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.060
See if you can -- you have to
really grind it,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.000
like this, look.
 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.060
Okay?
 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.980
So we've got two spices here
that we need to identify.

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.355
Okay, you can go back and grind
them at your seat and then show

00:01:08.355 --> 00:01:09.260
it your neighbors.
 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.299
Later on I'm going to ask you
whether you know what it is.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.998
Okay, so here's how we're going
through the history of organic

00:01:20.998 --> 00:01:24.200
chemistry and the development of
the molecular model.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.860
So generation by generation.
 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.810
And last time we got up to
students of Kekulé,

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.330
who actually did experiments to
allow people to figure out

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.730
something about structure,
not only what was connected to

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.800
what --
that's constitution;

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.560
remember, the nature and the
sequence of bonds.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.250
So we had composition,
what elements are there,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.590
what ratio they're in,
how many atoms.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.660
Right?
 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.849
Then constitution,
the nature and sequence in

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:53.430
bonds.
 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.447
And now we're going to see if
you can go beyond that,

00:01:56.447 --> 00:01:59.000
without cheating and using
X-ray diffraction,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.959
to figure out how things are
arranged in space;

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:02.930
so structure.
 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.113
And we talked last time about
Koerner's proof of positions in

00:02:07.113 --> 00:02:09.675
benzene,
and his proof that all the

00:02:09.675 --> 00:02:13.340
positions in benzene were
equivalent to one another.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.740
And today we're going to go
really to the next generation.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.703
Koerner wasn't all that much
younger than -- or he was at

00:02:18.703 --> 00:02:20.818
least halfway in the generation
there.

00:02:20.818 --> 00:02:24.669
But van't Hoff is a full
generation beyond.

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:25.938
So we're going to look at him.
 

00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:28.514
It says under him
"tetrahedron",

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:31.970
and it says down here
"tetrahedral carbon".

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.187
And also we'll see something
about Albert Ladenburg and about

00:02:39.187 --> 00:02:42.916
your, whatever,
great-great-chem

00:02:42.916 --> 00:02:48.449
ical-grandfather,
Peter Kohler at Harvard.

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.543
Okay, so as we were closing
last time we were looking at

00:02:51.543 --> 00:02:55.030
this definite picture of the
arrangement of atoms in space,

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.470
where the models are clearly
real models,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.430
held together by rubber tubing,
and they're tetrahedral,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.687
and it explains why there can
be three isomers of

00:03:04.687 --> 00:03:09.478
disubstituted --
symmetrically disubstituted --

00:03:09.478 --> 00:03:10.430
ethane.
 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.270
Of course it was wrong.
 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.337
Do you know why it was wrong,
why there are not three

00:03:15.337 --> 00:03:16.460
different models?
 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.568
Yeah.
 

00:03:17.568 --> 00:03:20.788
Because you can rotate about
the middle bond freely;

00:03:20.788 --> 00:03:23.650
it's not frozen in one rotation
here.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.680
Or is it?
 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.870
We'll see something about that
later on.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.370
That turns out to be what's
called conformation.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.479
Remember, that's one of the C's.
 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:36.514
But now we're in configuration,
how things are attached to the

00:03:36.514 --> 00:03:37.440
tetrahedron.
 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.990
Okay, so after Paternó
had published that,

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.500
he got a letter from his former
sponsor,

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.300
who had moved on,
Adolf Lieben,

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.410
an Austrian who was at this
time in Italy;

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.666
first in Palermo and then,
at this time I think he was in

00:03:56.666 --> 00:04:00.911
Northern Italy,
I think, in Pisa -- oh,

00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:03.360
Torino;
it says up at the top,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.802
"Torino,
25th of June,

00:04:04.802 --> 00:04:05.580
1869."
 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.900
And you can see a translation
there if you click.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.560
But anyhow it says:
"My dear Emmanuele."

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.133
(They corresponded,
like several of these people

00:04:13.133 --> 00:04:16.879
who were great friends;
were for a very long time.)

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:20.064
"Permit me to make an
observation regarding the

00:04:20.064 --> 00:04:23.500
isomerism pointed out by you and
by Cannizzaro."

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.377
(It's a little bit misleading
to say "by

00:04:25.377 --> 00:04:26.189
Cannizzaro."
 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:29.315
He was very cautious about
this, as you know,

00:04:29.315 --> 00:04:31.519
but he introduced the paper.)
 

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:33.500
"Between"
(and he shows those two

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.350
structures here.
 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.990
Which look like type
structures, with those brackets.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.968
And you can see what's fastened
on the two carbons is H^2Cl

00:04:42.968 --> 00:04:45.199
H^2Cl, and H^2Cl,
H^2Cl.

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.218
But he wrote the Cl's
differently, obviously meaning

00:04:48.218 --> 00:04:51.180
to denote this difference in
phase of rotation.)

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.509
"Certainly it's not
absurd, this kind of isomerism,

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.761
even without any differences
among the four valences of

00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:01.100
carbon."
 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.990
(Remember one could've been
straight, one crooked,

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.009
short, long or something like
that.)

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.697
"I believe, however,
that I don't err when I suppose

00:05:11.697 --> 00:05:15.865
that the same cause which keeps
me from accepting it will also

00:05:15.865 --> 00:05:19.009
keep all the other chemists from
doing so,

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:22.899
in a silent agreement with one
another.

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:26.985
You perhaps haven't thought
that accepting this kind of

00:05:26.985 --> 00:05:31.225
isomerism crosses the Rubicon
which separates speculation

00:05:31.225 --> 00:05:35.766
that's considered legitimate
about the mode of combination of

00:05:35.766 --> 00:05:40.004
atoms from speculation which is
less legitimate about the

00:05:40.004 --> 00:05:43.410
position of the atoms in
space."

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.863
(And notice here that he added
as an afterthought,

00:05:46.863 --> 00:05:50.178
vero;
the true position of the atoms

00:05:50.178 --> 00:05:53.593
in space, rather than just
chemical position.

00:05:53.593 --> 00:05:54.370
Right?)
 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.410
"In all speculations that
have been made up to this time,

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.682
people have always been careful
never to let enter in either the

00:06:02.682 --> 00:06:07.454
relative positions in space
(Distances and surroundings of

00:06:07.454 --> 00:06:08.709
the atoms).
 

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:12.076
This idea doesn't even enter
into the speculations of

00:06:12.076 --> 00:06:14.406
Kekulé
about isomerism and the

00:06:14.406 --> 00:06:16.088
aromatic series."
 

00:06:16.088 --> 00:06:22.000
(So he draws the picture of the
hexagon and numbers 1 to 6.)

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.680
"Kekulé
believes that chlorine 1,

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.072
chlorine 2 positions is
different from chlorine 1,3 and

00:06:29.072 --> 00:06:31.733
from 1,4,
because in the first case the

00:06:31.733 --> 00:06:34.812
two carbon chlorines find
themselves combined with one

00:06:34.812 --> 00:06:37.216
another,
but in the second case they're

00:06:37.216 --> 00:06:39.985
separated by CH,
and in the third case they're

00:06:39.985 --> 00:06:41.370
separated by two CH's.
 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.838
And to accept this,
one has no need to make

00:06:44.838 --> 00:06:49.379
hypotheses about the
surroundings of the atoms."

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:51.680
That's really weird isn't it?
 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.968
He says in one case they're
connected to one another,

00:06:53.968 --> 00:06:56.564
in another case there's a CH in
between, and in another case

00:06:56.564 --> 00:06:58.060
there are two CH's in between.
 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.740
But to talk about this you
don't have to talk about the

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.129
surroundings of the atoms.
 

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:05.649
That doesn't make sense to us,
right?

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:08.105
But it's the difference between
drawing a graph,

00:07:08.105 --> 00:07:10.718
which is just a graph,
and drawing something that's

00:07:10.718 --> 00:07:12.810
supposed to show something in
space.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.363
He goes on and says,
"It could be that the two

00:07:17.363 --> 00:07:21.242
chlorines in positions 1,
2 are in truth more distant

00:07:21.242 --> 00:07:24.629
from one another than the ones
in positions 1,4!"

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:29.250
(And he draws an exclamation
point there.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.290
Right?)
 

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.839
"This just doesn't enter
into Kekulé's hypothesis.

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:37.497
Making hypotheses about the
relative positions of the atoms

00:07:37.497 --> 00:07:41.470
in space would make possible two
isomers of dichloromethane,

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.055
even accepting the symmetry of
the four valencesâ€¦"

00:07:47.055 --> 00:07:49.214
(That is,
that all the valences of a

00:07:49.214 --> 00:07:51.839
single carbon are equal to one
another.)

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:55.009
"â€¦and the existence
of a single isomer of methyl

00:07:55.009 --> 00:07:55.600
chloride.
 

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.894
For example,"
And he draws the two structures

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:00.206
here, the ones where the
chlorines are far from one

00:08:00.206 --> 00:08:02.290
another and when they're near
one another;

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:06.035
but that's just the graph,
that's not where they are in

00:08:06.035 --> 00:08:06.588
space.
 

00:08:06.588 --> 00:08:07.023
Okay.
 

00:08:07.023 --> 00:08:11.353
He added as an afterthought
between the lines here,

00:08:11.353 --> 00:08:15.596
"There would also result
two isomers of ethyl

00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:17.329
chloride."
 

00:08:17.329 --> 00:08:23.528
"I repeat that I don't
consider this kind of isomerism

00:08:23.528 --> 00:08:24.490
absurd.
 

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:29.196
But since we have no means to
know the topographic position of

00:08:29.196 --> 00:08:31.709
the atoms,
while we have many to know how

00:08:31.709 --> 00:08:33.519
they are connected to one
another,

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:38.090
I consider it a bit dangerous
for science.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.092
Shooting off into space in
search of atoms,

00:08:41.092 --> 00:08:44.740
one risks losing the ground
under his feet."

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:45.397
(Right?
 

00:08:45.397 --> 00:08:48.308
So be careful former student.)
 

00:08:48.308 --> 00:08:50.426
"Greeting to Cannizzaro,
and Koerner,

00:08:50.426 --> 00:08:50.840
Amato.
 

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.279
I'll write soon to Compisi.
 

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:55.870
Your friend, Adolf Lieben."
 

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.408
Okay, so be careful.
 

00:08:57.408 --> 00:08:59.980
This isn't what structures are
about, right?

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.070
They're just graphs that show
constitution.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.674
So here's Koerner,
you remember,

00:09:04.674 --> 00:09:07.418
before he went south,
in Ghent, with Kekulé.

00:09:07.418 --> 00:09:10.899
And on the right of this group
is Albert Ladenburg who,

00:09:10.899 --> 00:09:13.450
once you know,
once you've read what he wrote,

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.658
you can sort of read into his
attitude there,

00:09:16.658 --> 00:09:20.710
that he was a hard guy to deal
with.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:21.034
Okay?
 

00:09:21.034 --> 00:09:24.099
He thought he knew a lot,
and he did know a lot,

00:09:24.099 --> 00:09:26.250
but not as much as he thought.
 

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.778
So he published this paper the
next year, in 1869;

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:32.340
or the same year that
Paternó

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.950
published his thing.
 

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.942
"Kekulé
adopts two hypotheses:

00:09:36.942 --> 00:09:41.250
(1) The 6 hydrogen atoms of
benzene are equivalent;"

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:45.475
(that's what Koerner actually
proved) "and (2) Each

00:09:45.475 --> 00:09:50.085
hydrogen atom of benzene has two
sets of two others which are

00:09:50.085 --> 00:09:53.620
symmetrically arranged with
respect to it;

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:59.942
that is, 1.2 is the same as
1.6, and 1.3 is the same as 1.5,

00:09:59.942 --> 00:10:04.980
although 4 is unique with
respect to 1."

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:05.364
(Okay?
 

00:10:05.364 --> 00:10:08.629
So there are two that are
symmetrically arranged.)

00:10:08.629 --> 00:10:12.480
"Already several years ago
I had occasion to make

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.169
Kekulé
aware that his graphical

00:10:15.169 --> 00:10:18.149
formula for benzene is not
adequate,

00:10:18.149 --> 00:10:21.720
since here 1.2 and 1.6 must be
inequivalent,

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.991
while one could have various
views about whether positions 3

00:10:25.991 --> 00:10:28.600
and 5 are equivalent or
not."

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.551
Why would one and two be
certainly -- two and six,

00:10:31.551 --> 00:10:33.599
that is, be certainly
inequivalent,

00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:36.129
but three and five might or
might not?

00:10:40.379 --> 00:10:41.779
Yeah, Kate?
 

00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:45.981
Student:  Because
between one and two is a double

00:10:45.981 --> 00:10:49.649
bond and between one and six is
a single bond.

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.669
Prof: Both have a single
and a double.

00:10:51.669 --> 00:10:55.850
But what about 1.3 and 1.5?
 

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.168
Are they 100% equivalent?
 

00:10:58.168 --> 00:11:00.918
Student: 
&gt;.

00:11:00.918 --> 00:11:01.615
Prof: Ah ha!
 

00:11:01.615 --> 00:11:03.777
because one is single-double
and the other is double-single,

00:11:03.777 --> 00:11:04.620
going the other way.
 

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.440
So that might or might not be
equivalent, Ladenburg says.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.519
"Both conditions could,
however, be fulfilled through

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:14.385
alternative formulas which,
so far as I know,

00:11:14.385 --> 00:11:16.600
have not been proposed
before."

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.960
So here are Ladenburg's
formulas.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.548
And the one in the middle,
the triangular prism,

00:11:23.548 --> 00:11:26.048
actually came to be called,
100 years later,

00:11:26.048 --> 00:11:28.972
or a little,
seventy years later,

00:11:28.972 --> 00:11:31.440
Ladenburg benzene,
right?

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.279
Because someone was able to
synthesize that.

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:37.480
It's also called prismane,
because it looks like a prism,

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.080
right?
 

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.788
And then there's this funny
structure on the right.

00:11:41.788 --> 00:11:48.240
Okay, so this is 1872,
and we're going to --

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.467
there's van't Hoff,
who is an eighteen-year-old

00:11:52.467 --> 00:11:55.779
student,
come to Bonn to see the great

00:11:55.779 --> 00:11:56.970
Kekulé.
 

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:02.086
And he writes,
in 1876, at the age of 24,

00:12:02.086 --> 00:12:05.028
a reply to Ladenburg.
 

00:12:05.028 --> 00:12:07.581
"Proof that the prism
formula"

00:12:07.581 --> 00:12:11.248
(of Ladenburg) "suffers
from the same problem as the

00:12:11.248 --> 00:12:15.306
hexagon with fixed double bonds
removes the previously asserted

00:12:15.306 --> 00:12:18.514
superiority from the
former" (from the prism)

00:12:18.514 --> 00:12:21.197
"and makes the original
Kekulé

00:12:21.197 --> 00:12:25.565
notation not only simpler,
but also the presentation with

00:12:25.565 --> 00:12:27.899
which the facts conform
best."

00:12:27.899 --> 00:12:31.264
Because Kekulé
had the idea that what these

00:12:31.264 --> 00:12:35.038
lines really meant was how often
the bonds collide --

00:12:35.038 --> 00:12:37.620
how often the atoms collide
with one another.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.990
They collide more often,
he thought, when it's a double

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:41.570
bond than when it's a single
bond.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.744
So he thought that in this
case, although you would draw

00:12:43.744 --> 00:12:44.841
single,
double, single,

00:12:44.841 --> 00:12:47.551
double, that the number of
collisions actually was the same

00:12:47.551 --> 00:12:48.720
one way and the other.
 

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.852
So you'd draw both formulas to
be in between what we would call

00:12:52.852 --> 00:12:54.519
now resonance formulas.
 

00:12:54.519 --> 00:12:57.899
So anyhow, this young student,
twenty-four years old now,

00:12:57.899 --> 00:13:01.139
says Ladenburg's off base in
saying the prism is better,

00:13:01.139 --> 00:13:05.586
because it has the same problem
and you can't get out of it with

00:13:05.586 --> 00:13:07.210
this vibration thing.
 

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:11.865
Okay, "The 1,2; 5,6;
and 3,4 derivatives are

00:13:11.865 --> 00:13:15.519
completely similar,
although differing from 4,5;

00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:17.139
2,3; 6,1."
 

00:13:17.139 --> 00:13:22.039
So 1,2; 5,6;
and 3,4 are completely similar.

00:13:22.039 --> 00:13:28.840
So here's 1,2; 3,6;
-- 1 5,6; and 3,4.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.211
Right?
 

00:13:29.211 --> 00:13:32.181
And you can see that just by
rotating by 120°

00:13:32.181 --> 00:13:34.100
you go from one to the next.
 

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.754
So those he says "are
completely similar,

00:13:37.754 --> 00:13:41.490
although differing from 4,5;
2,3; 6,1."

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:45.294
Do you see how they differ?
 

00:13:45.294 --> 00:13:47.409
4,5; 2,3; 6,1.
 

00:13:47.409 --> 00:13:50.129
4,5; 2,3; 6,1.
 

00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:54.408
Now are the red and the blue
different or not?

00:13:54.408 --> 00:13:57.360
The reds, obviously you just
rotate and you get from one to

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:57.919
the next.
 

00:13:57.919 --> 00:13:59.100
How about from a red to a blue?
 

00:14:03.019 --> 00:14:06.726
Can you rotate to get from one
to the other,

00:14:06.726 --> 00:14:08.710
from a red to a blue?
 

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:11.860
Say the one's in front?
 

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.820
What happens if you rotate to
put a red line on a blue line?

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.830
Student:  It's sitting
on a square face.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:20.038
Prof: Sam?
 

00:14:20.038 --> 00:14:22.070
Student:  It's sitting
on a square face instead of --

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.166
Prof: Ah,
then it's sitting on a square

00:14:24.166 --> 00:14:25.750
face instead of triangular face.
 

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.500
It's not the same anymore.
 

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.918
Everybody see that?
 

00:14:29.918 --> 00:14:30.325
Right?
 

00:14:30.325 --> 00:14:33.158
This, as drawn,
it has a triangle on top.

00:14:33.158 --> 00:14:37.291
If you turn it 180°
, so as to superimpose the blue

00:14:37.291 --> 00:14:40.808
in front, on the red,
then you no longer have a

00:14:40.808 --> 00:14:42.340
triangle on top.
 

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:47.517
It's not the same thing,
van't Hoff, twenty-four years

00:14:47.517 --> 00:14:48.690
old, says.
 

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:53.190
What do you think Ladenburg
would say about that?

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:54.419
Well we'll see.
 

00:14:54.419 --> 00:14:57.080
But van't Hoff goes on.
 

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.719
He says: "A 1,3 product is
different according to whether A

00:15:01.719 --> 00:15:04.149
or B occupies position 1."
 

00:15:04.149 --> 00:15:07.302
(In the right,
there's single double,

00:15:07.302 --> 00:15:10.365
double single,
when you go from A to

00:15:10.365 --> 00:15:11.678
B.***Okay?)
 

00:15:11.678 --> 00:15:14.716
"Exactly the same thing
happens in Ladenburg's

00:15:14.716 --> 00:15:15.690
formula."
 

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.418
(With the prism.)
 

00:15:17.418 --> 00:15:21.192
"An adequate consideration
shows that I and II are

00:15:21.192 --> 00:15:23.220
absolutely different."
 

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.889
So one.
 

00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:28.289
And notice he puts dashed lines
in.

00:15:28.289 --> 00:15:31.320
Why?
 

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.710
Why is one bond shown dashed?
 

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.308
Says so, right?
 

00:15:35.308 --> 00:15:37.470
Because it's behind,
it's hidden.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.629
So he's definitely showing this
in three dimensions.

00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:43.826
And if it's in three
dimensions, then AB goes left to

00:15:43.826 --> 00:15:45.493
right,
in one, and right to left in

00:15:45.493 --> 00:15:47.772
the other,
and you can't superimpose them,

00:15:47.772 --> 00:15:51.460
they're not the same thing;
according to van't Hoff.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.110
Now what would Ladenburg say
about this?

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:56.279
He wouldn't take it lying down.
 

00:15:56.279 --> 00:16:00.046
He wrote back and said,
"van't Hoff finds the two

00:16:00.046 --> 00:16:03.668
formulas below absolutely
different."

00:16:03.668 --> 00:16:09.230
How is what he wrote different
from what van't Hoff wrote?

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.149
How are Ladenburg's formulas
different from van't Hoff's?

00:16:19.179 --> 00:16:20.929
Pardon me?
 

00:16:20.929 --> 00:16:21.980
It's not what?
 

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.480
Student:  It isn't in 3D.
 

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.759
Prof: How do you know
whether it's in 3D or not?

00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:27.360
Student:  Well,
then he'd use a dashed line.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.928
Prof: Ah,
he doesn't use the dashed line.

00:16:30.928 --> 00:16:31.264
Okay?
 

00:16:31.264 --> 00:16:35.005
So he says they're absolute --
that van't Hoff finds them

00:16:35.005 --> 00:16:36.610
absolutely different.
 

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:39.042
But he's just drawing
constitution,

00:16:39.042 --> 00:16:40.759
what's linked to what.
 

00:16:40.759 --> 00:16:42.990
Right?
 

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.529
"I cannot agree with him
in this.

00:16:45.529 --> 00:16:49.389
Van't Hoff is dragging
something into the formulas

00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:53.960
which I, together with most
chemists, expressly exclude.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.799
I refer to the arrangement in
space."

00:16:57.799 --> 00:17:02.028
(Right? So keep that out. Okay?)
 

00:17:02.028 --> 00:17:05.192
"The formula takes account
of the composition,

00:17:05.192 --> 00:17:07.787
molecular weight,
and mode of union of the

00:17:07.787 --> 00:17:08.799
atoms."
 

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:11.849
So composition and what else?
 

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:13.390
What other C?
 

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.028
Student:
&gt;.

00:17:15.028 --> 00:17:18.695
Prof: Composition,
that's composition of molecular

00:17:18.695 --> 00:17:21.141
weight he says;
and the "mode of

00:17:21.141 --> 00:17:22.410
union," right?
 

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:23.920
Which is constitution.
 

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.819
It doesn't talk about
arrangement in space.

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:27.980
Right?
 

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.337
"If van't Hoff's view of
space really will not tolerate

00:17:31.337 --> 00:17:33.730
the two formulas above to be
identical,

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:37.400
then I invite him,
for his own special purposes,

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.490
to use a different benzene
formula,

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:43.328
which was proposed by me in the
year 1869,

00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:46.490
when I compared the hexagon and
the prism for the first time,

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:51.440
together with the prism,
to which it is for me certainly

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.519
identical.
 

00:17:52.519 --> 00:17:56.130
It is the so-called Cross of
David.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:00.605
Even van't Hoff will have to
find that these two formulas are

00:18:00.605 --> 00:18:02.769
absolutely identical."
 

00:18:02.769 --> 00:18:09.349
Okay, now how could the prism
be identical to this?

00:18:09.349 --> 00:18:10.190
There's the prism.
 

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.420
They certainly don't look
identical.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.609
But watch this.
 

00:18:13.609 --> 00:18:15.717
Let's twist it;
keep all the bonds,

00:18:15.717 --> 00:18:16.150
but twist it.
 

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.848
Right?
 

00:18:21.848 --> 00:18:27.071
So as long as you don't have
dashed lines for 3D,

00:18:27.071 --> 00:18:32.019
they're the same;
one is just twisted.

00:18:32.019 --> 00:18:32.285
Okay?
 

00:18:32.285 --> 00:18:34.618
So Ladenburg is expressly
keeping this out.

00:18:34.618 --> 00:18:37.720
Now this point of view survived
for quite awhile.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.711
Here's some notes taken by a
former Yale colleague,

00:18:41.711 --> 00:18:43.627
R.M. Fuoss,
in the 1920s,

00:18:43.627 --> 00:18:48.259
when he was a student at
Harvard in Kohler's course.

00:18:48.259 --> 00:18:51.190
His notes say:
"Benzene gives one

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:55.230
monosubstitution product and
three disubstituted.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.114
Cyclohexatriene"
(if you had the ring with

00:18:58.114 --> 00:19:01.366
double single,
double single) "apparently

00:19:01.366 --> 00:19:04.118
requires four disubstitution
products.

00:19:04.118 --> 00:19:10.180
should be different,
it was argued."

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.678
But then he shows another
example of an experiment that's

00:19:13.678 --> 00:19:15.990
been done here,
with this molecule.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:21.740
Now these hydrogens can be --
it turns out that those

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:27.048
hydrogens we'll call later
Î± hydrogens,

00:19:27.048 --> 00:19:30.328
because they're the first,
next to a carbonyl group.

00:19:30.328 --> 00:19:32.635
So here's a carbon-oxygen
double bond, and then a C that

00:19:32.635 --> 00:19:34.479
has the H;
carbon-oxygen double bond,

00:19:34.479 --> 00:19:35.509
a C that has the H.
 

00:19:35.509 --> 00:19:37.279
Those are called Î±.
 

00:19:37.279 --> 00:19:41.038
And it was known that it's
possible to easily substitute

00:19:41.038 --> 00:19:43.500
Î± carbons with other
things;

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.660
more easily than other carbons
typically, other hydrogens.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.200
So you'd expect to get two
possible structures.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.373
You could do this Î±
one and get the R in that

00:19:52.373 --> 00:19:55.609
position, or this one and get R
in that position.

00:19:55.609 --> 00:19:57.980
So you'd get two products.
 

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.980
Right?
 

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.910
Those two.
 

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.189
"We can alkylate"
(that is, put the R group on)

00:20:05.189 --> 00:20:07.588
"glutaconic acid in several
ways,

00:20:07.588 --> 00:20:10.910
but we always get the same
product 1.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:14.519
2 cannot be made,
no matter how we go.

00:20:14.519 --> 00:20:18.722
Hence it is not surprising that
only one ortho disubstituted

00:20:18.722 --> 00:20:20.788
product for benzene exists.
 

00:20:20.788 --> 00:20:24.328
The double bonds shift until
the stable system is

00:20:24.328 --> 00:20:25.509
reached."
 

00:20:25.509 --> 00:20:27.848
Right? So you can't make one.
 

00:20:27.848 --> 00:20:29.703
Or if you make it,
it immediately transforms to

00:20:29.703 --> 00:20:30.348
the other one.
 

00:20:30.348 --> 00:20:33.160
So there could be two,
but there aren't.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.190
Okay? So this is what?
 

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:39.719
This is forty years later,
almost half a century later,

00:20:39.719 --> 00:20:42.990
and he's still saying the same
thing.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.910
Okay?
 

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.078
Now, is it really that?
 

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:49.353
Well you can calculate by
Spartan that the minimum energy

00:20:49.353 --> 00:20:52.099
really is symmetrical with equal
bond distances,

00:20:52.099 --> 00:20:53.269
but it vibrates.
 

00:20:53.269 --> 00:20:57.029
It can vibrate like this --
right?

00:20:57.029 --> 00:21:00.403
-- in and out,
and the frequency of that is

00:21:00.403 --> 00:21:01.930
1276 wavenumbers.
 

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.460
You've taken spectra,
you've seen that kind of thing.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.890
Although this particular one is
not active in the infrared.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:09.029
You can't see it in IR.
 

00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:10.359
It's called breathing.
 

00:21:10.359 --> 00:21:12.640
&gt;
 

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.970
Right?
 

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.452
Okay, but there's another way
it can vibrate,

00:21:16.452 --> 00:21:19.217
like this: distort in that
direction, then back to

00:21:19.217 --> 00:21:21.700
symmetrical, and in the other
direction.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.369
See what that is?
 

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.571
That's distorting in the
Kekulé

00:21:27.571 --> 00:21:29.720
direction, single double,
single double.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.278
Right?
 

00:21:31.278 --> 00:21:35.559
So that one is at 1367
wavenumbers;

00:21:35.559 --> 00:21:36.950
the Kekulé distortion.
 

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:39.328
But it's around a single
minimum.

00:21:39.328 --> 00:21:43.259
So at any given time the thing
is probably vibrating.

00:21:43.259 --> 00:21:45.500
So it is single double,
single double.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:50.858
But the lowest energy is all
the same intermediate distance.

00:21:50.858 --> 00:21:55.392
Okay, now might you be able to
push on benzene and make it

00:21:55.392 --> 00:21:59.368
favor the Kekulé
structure, with alternating

00:21:59.368 --> 00:22:00.880
bond distances?
 

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.210
Well that's a challenge.
 

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:09.646
So a chemist named Jay Siegel
and his colleagues synthesized

00:22:09.646 --> 00:22:12.969
this one,
which you'll notice has a

00:22:12.969 --> 00:22:16.309
four-membered ring,
with funny bond angles,

00:22:16.309 --> 00:22:19.240
attached to one side of the
benzene.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.759
That means those angles are
going to be stretched and so on.

00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:25.630
So they're going to distort and
make that bond different.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.930
And indeed that bond,
1,6, is a little

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:29.828
different.
 

00:22:29.828 --> 00:22:33.096
But on the other sideâ€¦
if it made that one -- let's

00:22:33.096 --> 00:22:35.773
say it's a little bit long;
make it single and the

00:22:35.773 --> 00:22:37.836
neighbors double,
because of the way it's being

00:22:37.836 --> 00:22:40.944
stretched --
then if that propagated around

00:22:40.944 --> 00:22:42.483
the ring,
single double,

00:22:42.483 --> 00:22:43.798
single double,
single double,

00:22:43.798 --> 00:22:47.099
the ones on the left would be
different lengths.

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:49.240
But in fact they're the same.
 

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.359
Right?
 

00:22:50.359 --> 00:22:52.650
So it doesn't happen here.
 

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:56.413
So that's the kind of thing
that people sometimes do to test

00:22:56.413 --> 00:22:59.220
out the limits of these kinds of
theories.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:03.098
Okay, so we've seen the
position determination.

00:23:03.098 --> 00:23:07.130
And now more about tetrahedral
carbon.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:13.023
And to get there we're going to
step back just a bit to look at

00:23:13.023 --> 00:23:17.208
Louis Pasteur,
who was in a different line of

00:23:17.208 --> 00:23:19.680
business at this time.
 

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.114
Now it's hard to prove that two
samples are identical because

00:23:23.114 --> 00:23:26.721
there could always be some other
test in which they appear to be

00:23:26.721 --> 00:23:29.318
different,
even though everything you've

00:23:29.318 --> 00:23:31.298
done so far shows them the same.
 

00:23:31.298 --> 00:23:34.318
But let's take carvone as an
example.

00:23:34.318 --> 00:23:38.578
Here's a sample of carvone,
a bottle of carvone.

00:23:38.578 --> 00:23:41.700
And if I crack it a little bit,
I can smell it.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.579
It has a very nice smell.
 

00:23:43.579 --> 00:23:46.289
Here, I'll pass it around here.
 

00:23:46.289 --> 00:23:49.380
Don't spill it obviously.
 

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:52.098
Do you recognize the odor?
 

00:23:52.098 --> 00:23:54.039
Actually I have another bottle
too.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.170
Here let's start this one over
here.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:01.819
I'll start it with Catherine.
 

00:24:01.819 --> 00:24:04.278
So just smell that one.
 

00:24:04.278 --> 00:24:05.720
Don't put your nose right down
in it.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.730
But it's not that strong.
 

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:11.098
It's very pleasant actually.
 

00:24:11.098 --> 00:24:14.858
Now, this stuff is called
carvone.

00:24:14.858 --> 00:24:17.509
There's a reason it's called
carvone.

00:24:17.509 --> 00:24:21.000
How are you doing Rick,
with your grinding?

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.038
Can you smell anything on it?
 

00:24:23.038 --> 00:24:24.410
Student:  Definitely can
smell it.

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:25.910
Prof: What does it smell
like?

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:29.402
Student:  It smells to
me like -- I'm not sure if I

00:24:29.402 --> 00:24:33.140
know the exact name but it's a
little like sesame seeds --

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.690
Prof: A little like
sesame seeds.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.462
But there's another -- pass it
to Shai next to you here,

00:24:37.462 --> 00:24:38.269
let him smell.
 

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.019
Is it familiar?
 

00:24:45.019 --> 00:24:45.720
How about anybody?
 

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.269
How about the bottle here
coming?

00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:48.289
Do you notice it?
 

00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:50.078
Is it a familiar scent?
 

00:24:50.078 --> 00:24:51.538
Student:  Smells like
peppermint.

00:24:51.538 --> 00:24:53.819
Prof: It's spearmint,
not peppermint.

00:24:53.819 --> 00:24:55.529
But you're close.
 

00:24:55.529 --> 00:24:56.480
Shai, how are you doing?
 

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.618
Does it smell like peppermint
to you?

00:24:59.618 --> 00:25:04.368
Student:  I couldn't say
what kind mint it smells like.

00:25:04.368 --> 00:25:05.549
Prof: A little bit like
mint.

00:25:05.549 --> 00:25:08.450
Okay, how are doing Yoonjoo?
 

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.108
You're grinding up a different
stuff.

00:25:10.108 --> 00:25:14.700
You're grinding dill seed,
in fact.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.539
Does it smell?
 

00:25:16.539 --> 00:25:18.618
Student:  Yes it does.
 

00:25:18.618 --> 00:25:20.509
Prof: What does it smell
like?

00:25:20.509 --> 00:25:22.700
Dill seed maybe, right?
 

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:28.519
But carvone comes from -- this
is a familiar scent.

00:25:28.519 --> 00:25:30.460
I'm surprised you didn't get
it, Shai.

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.259
Did anybody else recognize?
 

00:25:33.259 --> 00:25:35.569
Did you get it, Andrew?
 

00:25:35.569 --> 00:25:36.700
No.
 

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.391
How about the bottle that's
coming along the back row there,

00:25:39.391 --> 00:25:40.349
that little bottle?
 

00:25:40.349 --> 00:25:42.190
Yeah, notice it?
 

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:43.190
Student:  Rye.
 

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.019
Prof: It's rye.
 

00:25:44.019 --> 00:25:45.078
Rye bread has that.
 

00:25:45.078 --> 00:25:47.740
It's caraway,
those seeds are caraway.

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:53.599
And caraway is -- carv
is the Latin root for it.

00:25:53.599 --> 00:25:55.170
It's like caraway, right?
 

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:58.602
So carvone, this substance
we're passing around,

00:25:58.602 --> 00:25:59.990
carvone, caraway.
 

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.950
Okay?
 

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.709
Now, so let's look at the --
suppose we took these two

00:26:03.709 --> 00:26:06.730
bottles and you distilled them,
found the boiling point.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:10.369
Both bottles have 230-231°.
 

00:26:10.369 --> 00:26:11.808
Right?
 

00:26:11.808 --> 00:26:15.960
The densities are exactly the
same.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.344
The refractive indices for
those two bottles,

00:26:18.344 --> 00:26:20.781
how much they bend light when
it goes through,

00:26:20.781 --> 00:26:21.920
exactly the same.
 

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.269
The infrared spectra are
identical;

00:26:24.269 --> 00:26:27.328
to the extent that any IR
spectra are identical.

00:26:27.328 --> 00:26:30.395
You know from experiment that
if you put more in one sample

00:26:30.395 --> 00:26:32.670
than in another they don't look
the same.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:33.160
Right?
 

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.450
Did you notice that in lab?
 

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:38.300
If you ground up more stuff and
less stuff, the spectra don't

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:40.723
really look the same,
but then you can find there is

00:26:40.723 --> 00:26:44.058
a peak to peak correspondence;
the intensities are never going

00:26:44.058 --> 00:26:45.390
to be exactly the same.
 

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.969
But to the extent IR spectra
can be the same,

00:26:47.969 --> 00:26:49.200
these are the same.
 

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.880
If you take their NMR spectra
they're the same.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.618
So they must be the same.
 

00:26:53.618 --> 00:26:58.798
Or is there any property in
which they differ?

00:26:58.798 --> 00:27:01.460
Any property that those two
bottles differ in?

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:02.558
Students:  Smell.
 

00:27:02.558 --> 00:27:04.910
Prof: The smell is
different.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:08.521
Now, those bottles -- they're
in dark bottles,

00:27:08.521 --> 00:27:10.848
to protect them from light.
 

00:27:10.848 --> 00:27:13.867
But if I poured them out --
they should be colorless liquids

00:27:13.867 --> 00:27:16.118
but I bet anything they're brown
-- right?

00:27:16.118 --> 00:27:18.730
-- because they've sat around
and a little bit is oxidized.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:21.652
So it's very difficult with
scent, because little bits of

00:27:21.652 --> 00:27:24.470
other things can make them smell
a little different.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.801
Right?
 

00:27:24.801 --> 00:27:27.960
You don't need much stuff for
scent of the proper thing.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:31.643
So it's hard to be confident
that this difference,

00:27:31.643 --> 00:27:35.777
that one of them is rye bread,
caraway, and the other is

00:27:35.777 --> 00:27:38.057
spearmint;
it's hard to be sure that

00:27:38.057 --> 00:27:39.088
that's a difference.
 

00:27:39.088 --> 00:27:42.486
But it turns out there's
another property you can measure

00:27:42.486 --> 00:27:42.848
too.
 

00:27:42.848 --> 00:27:46.519
And Karo syrup has that
property.

00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:48.720
And I'm going to show it to you.
 

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.940
It's the ability to rotate
polarized light.

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.170
Now -- oh, did I bring?
 

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:59.420
-- oh I forgot to bring my
Polaroids.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:04.660
So what I'm going to do is ask
a TA to go back to my office,

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:08.037
and on the table in my office
there's a brown package about

00:28:08.037 --> 00:28:10.890
that big that has two sheets of
Polaroid in it.

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:15.059
There's the key.
 

00:28:19.119 --> 00:28:20.059
Yeah, it's not here.
 

00:28:20.059 --> 00:28:22.519
Sorry.
 

00:28:22.519 --> 00:28:27.480
Let me think a second,
what we can go on to.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:32.317
I'll tell you the measure of
this, which is you have light

00:28:32.317 --> 00:28:33.930
that's polarized.
 

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:35.690
Have you all dealt with
polarized light?

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:38.636
You probably have polarized
sunglasses and you can turn it

00:28:38.636 --> 00:28:41.119
and see different light
reflecting off things.

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:42.640
Have you done that?
 

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.847
Okay, and that's why you have
polarized sunglasses,

00:28:44.847 --> 00:28:47.010
because light that reflects
doesn't go through the

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.220
particular direction that's in
the sunglasses.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.318
So you get rid of reflected
light.

00:28:52.318 --> 00:28:56.452
Okay, so but what you measure
is -- when light goes through a

00:28:56.452 --> 00:28:59.113
polarized filter,
it's as if it were -- you were

00:28:59.113 --> 00:29:01.509
shaking a rope and it was going
through a picket fence.

00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:04.309
It can vibrate one way but it
can't vibrate the other way.

00:29:04.309 --> 00:29:07.279
What vibrates in light?
 

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:09.769
What is vibrating?
 

00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:11.119
What's light?
 

00:29:11.119 --> 00:29:12.730
We went through this before.
 

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:13.740
Student: 
Electromagnetic --

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.890
Prof: Electromagnetic
radiation.

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:16.650
What's vibrating?
 

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.328
Prof: The electric field.
 

00:29:18.328 --> 00:29:21.291
And it's set up so one of
these, if you have a Polaroid

00:29:21.291 --> 00:29:23.760
filter, gets absorbed,
and the other one comes

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.420
through.
 

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.868
Okay, so light that comes
through is vibrating this way.

00:29:26.868 --> 00:29:30.042
And if you put another one,
that's crossed with it,

00:29:30.042 --> 00:29:33.089
like this, what do you get --
what do you see?

00:29:33.089 --> 00:29:34.088
Student:  Nothing.
 

00:29:34.088 --> 00:29:36.114
Prof: Nothing,
because the first one stops one

00:29:36.114 --> 00:29:37.710
and the second one stops the
other one.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:41.319
If you turn it like this,
then it goes on through.

00:29:41.319 --> 00:29:42.140
Okay?
 

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.702
But suppose that you put
something in the middle that

00:29:45.702 --> 00:29:48.170
rotated the plane of
polarization.

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:50.819
So the light's vibrating like
this.

00:29:50.819 --> 00:29:53.058
Suppose it's going like this.
 

00:29:53.058 --> 00:29:53.337
Right?
 

00:29:53.337 --> 00:29:55.979
Suppose by the time it gets to
the second filter it's like

00:29:55.979 --> 00:29:56.348
this.
 

00:29:56.348 --> 00:29:56.760
Right?
 

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.440
Now you have the second one
like this.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.298
What do you see?
 

00:30:02.298 --> 00:30:04.788
Light comes right on through,
because that's the way it's

00:30:04.788 --> 00:30:07.415
vibrating now;
if you rotated the plane of

00:30:07.415 --> 00:30:08.410
polarization.
 

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:08.693
Okay?
 

00:30:08.693 --> 00:30:10.458
That's what
"rotation"

00:30:10.458 --> 00:30:10.970
means.
 

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:19.618
Okay, now you measure this
property of a substance and call

00:30:19.618 --> 00:30:25.455
it specific rotation;
which is how many degrees it

00:30:25.455 --> 00:30:26.230
rotates.
 

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:33.577
And you have to say what light
rotates, so that the units of

00:30:33.577 --> 00:30:39.803
Î± are degrees -- how many
degrees it changes,

00:30:39.803 --> 00:30:43.288
per gram per milliliter.
 

00:30:43.288 --> 00:30:48.108
If you put more stuff in,
then you get a bigger effect.

00:30:48.108 --> 00:30:48.448
Right?
 

00:30:48.448 --> 00:30:50.480
So it depends on the
concentration.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.068
So how many degrees per mole,
you might say.

00:30:54.068 --> 00:30:54.404
Okay?
 

00:30:54.404 --> 00:30:58.357
But then it's per decimeter,
because the longer path you go,

00:30:58.357 --> 00:31:00.769
if it's rotating,
the further you go,

00:31:00.769 --> 00:31:02.578
the further it twists.
 

00:31:02.578 --> 00:31:09.140
So the old style cells were --
oh, no, that's not it.

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:13.240
Nice try.
 

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.759
This is really embarrassing.
 

00:31:14.759 --> 00:31:16.470
It's an envelope.
 

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:17.874
Teaching Assistant:
Oh it's an envelope.

00:31:17.874 --> 00:31:18.180
Oh okay.
 

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.450
Prof: Did you see it?
 

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:20.690
Teaching Assistant:
 I can take another look.

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:25.400
Prof: Okay,
good &gt;

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:29.220
Okay, let me show you the other
things I'm going to show you.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:32.509
Okay here -- actually here's --
we'll do a trick.

00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:37.069
Here are models of carvone.
 

00:31:37.069 --> 00:31:38.170
Okay?
 

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:42.148
Now I'm going to give them to
you guys, and I want you to

00:31:42.148 --> 00:31:44.848
compare and see if they're the
same.

00:31:44.848 --> 00:31:48.837
Stand up and let people see
what -- so decide how you --

00:31:48.837 --> 00:31:52.318
start maybe at the top,
with the methyl group.

00:31:52.318 --> 00:31:55.410
Each of you -- turn -- both of
you turn and face the thing,

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:56.368
so they can see.
 

00:31:56.368 --> 00:31:58.779
Now hold -- start with the
methyl group at the top.

00:31:58.779 --> 00:32:00.250
It starts with the methyl group.
 

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:04.397
Now Russell,
you describe it and then check

00:32:04.397 --> 00:32:09.731
and see whether -- Eric,
you check and see whether your

00:32:09.731 --> 00:32:13.190
model is the same as Russell's.
 

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.990
Okay?
 

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:18.309
While you're doing that,
I'll go help find the thing.

00:32:18.309 --> 00:32:21.808
So tell me when I get back.
 

00:32:21.808 --> 00:33:37.680
&lt;&lt;Professor McBride
leaves the class briefly&gt;&gt;

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.779
Prof: Okay what's the
answer?

00:33:39.779 --> 00:33:40.980
Are they the same?
 

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.692
Student:  One of them's
pointing down.

00:33:43.692 --> 00:33:45.788
I can't see it on the other
one.

00:33:45.788 --> 00:33:48.640
Prof: So is that real,
do you think?

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:54.654
Is that just a peculiarity of
the models, or does that relate

00:33:54.654 --> 00:33:56.160
to molecules?
 

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.881
Student:  I think it
should relate to the smell of

00:33:57.881 --> 00:33:58.250
the thing.
 

00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:59.615
Prof: Okay.
 

00:33:59.615 --> 00:34:04.170
Well anyhow -- if I can catch
my breath -- these are Polaroid

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:04.930
sheets.
 

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:10.210
So here you see me,
and here you don't.

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:12.449
Students:  Ohhh.
 

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:13.699
Prof: Okay?
 

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:17.500
Now, let's see a case of
rotation.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:29.836
So here you see crystals and
I'll put this -- I'll get light

00:34:29.836 --> 00:34:32.429
coming through.
 

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:37.731
And there's the Polaroid
filter, and here's another

00:34:37.731 --> 00:34:39.639
Polaroid filter.
 

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:41.949
Right? So I turn it 90°.
 

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:46.179
And now let me put the crystals
in there.

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:51.590
Now, so there,
most of it's coming through.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:55.269
But now watch.
 

00:34:55.269 --> 00:34:57.420
What do you notice?
 

00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:05.909
Student:
&gt;.

00:35:05.909 --> 00:35:10.159
Prof: What's happening?
 

00:35:10.159 --> 00:35:18.639
Student:
&gt;.

00:35:18.639 --> 00:35:20.670
Prof: What's surprising
about this?

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:24.699
Obviously they're rotating the
plane of polarization -- right?

00:35:24.699 --> 00:35:27.773
-- so that I have to set a
different angle in order to stop

00:35:27.773 --> 00:35:28.409
the light.
 

00:35:28.409 --> 00:35:31.059
But what's special about this
set of crystals?

00:35:31.059 --> 00:35:35.018
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:35:35.018 --> 00:35:37.902
Prof: Some are
right-handed and some are

00:35:37.902 --> 00:35:38.780
left-handed.
 

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:40.820
Right?
 

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:41.909
That's sodium chlorate.
 

00:35:41.909 --> 00:35:45.000
That's the stuff that
Gay-Lussac used.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:45.380
Right?
 

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:48.175
So this property was
discovered, of crystals,

00:35:48.175 --> 00:35:49.699
early in the century.
 

00:35:49.699 --> 00:35:51.280
Now how about liquids?
 

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.400
Will liquids do it?
 

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.179
Well here's glass.
 

00:35:56.179 --> 00:36:01.442
Glass doesn't do anything
special, it's just like the air

00:36:01.442 --> 00:36:02.570
around it.
 

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:08.697
But let me pour water in here,
and see if water does the

00:36:08.697 --> 00:36:09.590
trick.
 

00:36:14.429 --> 00:36:16.949
Nothing special, right?
 

00:36:16.949 --> 00:36:18.800
So let's try Karo syrup.
 

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.340
It's not quite January,
but it takes a little while.

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:35.969
It's a little bit yellow.
 

00:36:35.969 --> 00:36:37.739
It sat around awhile.
 

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:51.539
What's happening?
 

00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.699
Well there's an underlying
yellow that biases this.

00:37:00.699 --> 00:37:03.139
But we can get different colors.
 

00:37:03.139 --> 00:37:07.739
So different colors in the
spectrum are being blocked out.

00:37:07.739 --> 00:37:12.206
How can that be,
for different angles different

00:37:12.206 --> 00:37:13.079
colors?
 

00:37:13.079 --> 00:37:17.269
So the Karo syrup is rotating
the polarization,

00:37:17.269 --> 00:37:22.280
but it's rotating different
colors different amounts.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.260
Right?
 

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.309
So we block off different
colors at different angles.

00:37:30.039 --> 00:37:34.829
Okay, so if we're going to make
a measurement of the angle,

00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:39.041
how much it rotates,
we're going to have to say what

00:37:39.041 --> 00:37:41.519
color we're talking about.
 

00:37:41.519 --> 00:37:45.000
And that's what the D is.
 

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.469
The D is the color.
 

00:37:46.469 --> 00:37:49.699
There's a so-called D line of
sodium, a yellow color.

00:37:49.699 --> 00:37:52.480
The yellow street lights are
that color.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:52.760
Right?
 

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.382
So that's the color that was
used, because it was easy to

00:37:55.382 --> 00:37:56.739
generate in the old times.
 

00:37:56.739 --> 00:38:00.836
And twenty is how many degrees;
because it's different for

00:38:00.836 --> 00:38:02.340
different temperatures.
 

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:06.289
Okay, so you can measure the
specific rotation of a sample.

00:38:06.289 --> 00:38:09.750
And if it's in a solvent,
you have to say what solvent it

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:12.159
is, because it can vary with
solvent.

00:38:12.159 --> 00:38:14.150
So anyhow, back to our
comparison.

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:17.389
These odors were the same,
but we might not believe it.

00:38:17.389 --> 00:38:21.144
But if we measure the specific
rotation, it's equal and

00:38:21.144 --> 00:38:21.909
opposite.
 

00:38:21.909 --> 00:38:27.539
One is +62°
and the other is -62°.

00:38:27.539 --> 00:38:32.409
So these things somehow are
mirror images of one another.

00:38:32.409 --> 00:38:34.710
Now here is what you've already
seen.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:38.262
You can write the structure of
carvone, either longhand or

00:38:38.262 --> 00:38:39.010
shorthand.
 

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:40.360
And there are the two models.
 

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:43.422
And you correctly identified a
difference between them,

00:38:43.422 --> 00:38:46.543
that one has a hydrogen
pointing backwards and the other

00:38:46.543 --> 00:38:48.019
coming out toward you.
 

00:38:48.019 --> 00:38:50.780
And is this difference real?
 

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:53.831
Of course there were
differences in the sausage

00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:56.420
formulas too,
but those weren't real;

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.978
remember, those two compounds
turned out to be the same

00:38:58.978 --> 00:38:59.500
compound.
 

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:02.539
The question is,
is this difference real?

00:39:02.539 --> 00:39:07.172
Are there two carvones,
but with different impurities

00:39:07.172 --> 00:39:12.250
in them, so they smell
different, or is there just one?

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:14.525
Oh pardon me,
vice-versa from what I said

00:39:14.525 --> 00:39:14.980
there.
 

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:18.309
Okay, so tartaric acid turns
out to be the same thing.

00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:22.817
Remember, Berzelius coined the
name isomer to talk about

00:39:22.817 --> 00:39:27.079
tartaric acid and racemic acid,
which both came as byproducts

00:39:27.079 --> 00:39:29.300
of the wine industry and had
very,

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.219
very different melting points.
 

00:39:31.219 --> 00:39:33.929
So obviously they're quite
different from one another.

00:39:33.929 --> 00:39:36.860
And one of them turns out to
rotate light;

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.719
if you make an experiment like
this.

00:39:38.719 --> 00:39:43.554
It rotates light to the right,
by 13° per gram,

00:39:43.554 --> 00:39:46.650
per milliliter,
per decimeter.

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:47.130
Okay.
 

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:51.932
But if you heat it,
you get another compound called

00:39:51.932 --> 00:39:56.159
pyrotartaric acid,
or sometimes meso-tartaric

00:39:56.159 --> 00:39:57.119
acid.
 

00:39:57.119 --> 00:40:00.889
Meso doesn't mean anything,
except "between".

00:40:00.889 --> 00:40:05.170
Do you know any cases where
meso means between?

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:08.443
Mesopotamia means between the
Tigris and the Euphrates River,

00:40:08.443 --> 00:40:08.880
right?
 

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.989
So it just means in between.
 

00:40:09.989 --> 00:40:13.182
So there was another one in
between tartaric and racemic

00:40:13.182 --> 00:40:13.590
acid.
 

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:15.960
It wasn't between in melting
point;

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.320
it had 140°
as its melting point.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.539
And it didn't rotate light
either.

00:40:20.539 --> 00:40:23.402
So there were these three
different forms of tartaric

00:40:23.402 --> 00:40:27.090
acid, but all were found to have
the same constitutional formula;

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:30.690
the same things linked to the
carbons.

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:34.626
So here's a problem with the
model, in terms of isomer

00:40:34.626 --> 00:40:35.369
numbers.
 

00:40:35.369 --> 00:40:35.702
Okay?
 

00:40:35.702 --> 00:40:39.835
Sometimes too many isomers are
predicted, like Paternó's

00:40:39.835 --> 00:40:40.969
dibromoethane.
 

00:40:40.969 --> 00:40:42.719
He had different phases of
rotation;

00:40:42.719 --> 00:40:44.079
said those were different.
 

00:40:44.079 --> 00:40:45.711
In fact, they weren't
different, it was just

00:40:45.711 --> 00:40:48.179
experimental errors of someone
who thought they were different.

00:40:48.179 --> 00:40:52.250
So sometimes the model predicts
too many isomers.

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:56.440
But often, or sometimes at
least, it predicts too few;

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.900
as in the case of maleic and
fumaric acid where you have a

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:00.750
double bond.
 

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:03.960
There are two different
substances with different

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.099
melting points and properties.
 

00:41:06.099 --> 00:41:10.561
With lactic acid -- remember
that Scheele had found lactic

00:41:10.561 --> 00:41:15.018
acid from milk,
but Liebig had found it from

00:41:15.018 --> 00:41:17.673
meat --
and they were the same,

00:41:17.673 --> 00:41:22.329
it was found out about this
time by a guy named Wislicenus.

00:41:22.329 --> 00:41:25.856
They had the same constitution,
but one rotated to the right

00:41:25.856 --> 00:41:28.010
and the other rotated to the
left.

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:30.320
There was tartaric and racemic
acid;

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.893
which was even more complicated
because there was also

00:41:33.893 --> 00:41:38.072
meso-tartaric and also what came
to be called l-tartaric

00:41:38.072 --> 00:41:38.679
acid.
 

00:41:38.679 --> 00:41:41.349
And that was the discovery of
Pasteur.

00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:45.940
So in 1848, which was another
revolutionary time in France,

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:49.498
Pasteur was twenty-six years
old and was becoming an

00:41:49.498 --> 00:41:52.429
interdisciplinary scientist:
chemistry,

00:41:52.429 --> 00:41:55.460
physics, crystallography,
all he was studying.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:59.451
And he wrote a paper called
"On the relations that can

00:41:59.451 --> 00:42:03.235
exist among crystalline
form," (so crystallography)

00:42:03.235 --> 00:42:05.436
"chemical
composition,"

00:42:05.436 --> 00:42:08.672
(chemistry) "
and the direction of rotatory

00:42:08.672 --> 00:42:10.530
polarization."
 

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:15.476
That is this stuff we're
talking about,

00:42:15.476 --> 00:42:17.949
which is physics.
 

00:42:17.949 --> 00:42:21.527
Now remember we talked about
Mitscherlich and the ability to

00:42:21.527 --> 00:42:25.228
measure angles on crystals and
tell -- distinguish crystals by

00:42:25.228 --> 00:42:26.260
their angles.
 

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:32.619
So these are pictures that
Pasteur was using to draw his

00:42:32.619 --> 00:42:35.510
salts of tartaric acid.
 

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:39.063
In particular sodium -- it's a
diacid, and so you can have

00:42:39.063 --> 00:42:42.170
different cations;
sodium ammonium tartrate is

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:42.860
this one.
 

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.280
And there's his picture that he
drew of it.

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.376
And he said -- mostly you see
the faces that are shown in that

00:42:51.376 --> 00:42:55.139
picture, but sometimes you can
see other little faces.

00:42:55.139 --> 00:42:56.320
Right?
 

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:59.849
And you notice that the
crystals have symmetry.

00:42:59.849 --> 00:43:03.606
They have a horizontal plane of
symmetry and also a vertical

00:43:03.606 --> 00:43:04.880
plane of symmetry.
 

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.300
Right?
 

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:09.159
So if you can see one of those
edges,

00:43:09.159 --> 00:43:12.313
you should see the others that
are related by symmetry this

00:43:12.313 --> 00:43:14.016
direction,
symmetry this direction,

00:43:14.016 --> 00:43:15.429
and also symmetry this
direction.

00:43:15.429 --> 00:43:20.139
So you should see all eight,
in the tartrate.

00:43:20.139 --> 00:43:23.228
But always only four of them
are observed,

00:43:23.228 --> 00:43:27.050
in sodium ammonium tartrate;
not all eight.

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:29.938
Mitscherlich had studied this
stuff, and he was sort of the

00:43:29.938 --> 00:43:31.880
father of measuring angles like
this.

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.652
But when Pasteur was trying to
learn the technique and repeat

00:43:34.652 --> 00:43:36.380
it,
he noticed that you don't very

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.170
often get these edges all
together,

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:39.489
these little tiny ones.
 

00:43:39.489 --> 00:43:41.630
It usually looks like the
original picture did.

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:45.567
But when those sharp edges are
truncated by little additional

00:43:45.567 --> 00:43:48.980
faces, you only see four,
you don't see all eight.

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.719
So Mitscherlich had reported
that the -- now howâ€¦?

00:43:52.719 --> 00:43:55.219
-- That was tartrate, right?
 

00:43:55.219 --> 00:43:57.719
Now they had the idea that
racemate,

00:43:57.719 --> 00:43:59.768
which remember didn't rotate
light --

00:43:59.768 --> 00:44:03.396
Pasteur's idea was that
molecules were twisted in a

00:44:03.396 --> 00:44:06.079
right-hand or a left-handed
helix,

00:44:06.079 --> 00:44:08.460
and therefore they had this
effect on light,

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.789
to make it twist.
 

00:44:09.789 --> 00:44:10.739
Right?
 

00:44:10.739 --> 00:44:15.000
But one's that aren't twisted,
like racemic acid --

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.880
Where the molecules aren't
twisted,

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:20.130
then, at least in those,
you should see all eight,

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:23.039
because you will have mirror
images.

00:44:23.039 --> 00:44:24.030
Okay?
 

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:26.601
So he thought untwisted
molecules would be what's called

00:44:26.601 --> 00:44:29.780
"holohedral";
that is, have all their faces.

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:34.347
So he studied the sodium
ammonium racemate and was quite

00:44:34.347 --> 00:44:39.000
surprised to find that sometimes
he saw the red ones,

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.809
sometimes he saw the green
ones, but never on the same

00:44:42.809 --> 00:44:43.530
crystal.
 

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:47.467
Some crystals were right,
red, and some were left,

00:44:47.467 --> 00:44:48.110
green.
 

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:51.800
So he separated those crystals,
the right ones from the left

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:52.239
ones.
 

00:44:52.239 --> 00:44:54.931
He wrote: "I carefully
separated the right from the

00:44:54.931 --> 00:44:57.869
left crystals and observing
their dissolution separately,

00:44:57.869 --> 00:45:00.795
with Monsieur Biot's
polarization apparatus"

00:45:00.795 --> 00:45:04.086
(the thing that measures the
rotation) "I saw with

00:45:04.086 --> 00:45:07.501
surprise and delight that the
right crystals deviated the

00:45:07.501 --> 00:45:10.731
plane of polarization to the
right and the left to the

00:45:10.731 --> 00:45:11.889
left."
 

00:45:11.889 --> 00:45:15.869
So why did racemic acid not
rotate light?

00:45:15.869 --> 00:45:19.268
Student:
&gt;

00:45:19.268 --> 00:45:21.617
Prof: Because it was a
50:50 mixture of things that

00:45:21.617 --> 00:45:24.146
would rotate it one way --
it's not that it was untwisted

00:45:24.146 --> 00:45:26.853
-- it was that some of them
would rotate it one way and some

00:45:26.853 --> 00:45:29.079
would rotate it the other,
and they'd cancel out.

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.987
Okay.
 

00:45:32.987 --> 00:45:37.967
Oops I improved this and forgot
to take that one out;

00:45:37.967 --> 00:45:38.829
sorry.
 

00:45:38.829 --> 00:45:41.389
Okay, so now he knows what's
going on,

00:45:41.389 --> 00:45:45.739
that racemic acid is actually a
50:50 mixture of right-handed,

00:45:45.739 --> 00:45:49.530
dextro-tartaric acid,
d, that has a plus

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:53.072
rotation,
and left-handed tartaric acid,

00:45:53.072 --> 00:45:55.438
l,
levo, which has a minus

00:45:55.438 --> 00:45:57.860
rotation, but the same melting
point,

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:01.949
the same rotation,
but opposite in direction.

00:46:01.949 --> 00:46:04.570
So those are mirror images of
one another.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:07.320
And the racemic acid is a 50:50
mixture.

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:09.510
Now this was 1848.
 

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:12.360
So that's a long time from
where we've gotten to.

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:12.773
Right?
 

00:46:12.773 --> 00:46:15.880
That was ten years before the
idea of bonds.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:19.469
Okay?
 

00:46:19.469 --> 00:46:21.601
So that was
"resolution",

00:46:21.601 --> 00:46:24.989
the separation of a mixture
into the two components.

00:46:24.989 --> 00:46:25.476
Right?
 

00:46:25.476 --> 00:46:28.070
But what is meso-tartaric acid?
 

00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:30.059
Why doesn't it rotate?
 

00:46:30.059 --> 00:46:33.186
So now we go forward,
twenty-four years,

00:46:33.186 --> 00:46:37.914
to Bonn, and there's van't Hoff
studying with Kekulé,

00:46:37.914 --> 00:46:39.920
at the age of twenty.
 

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.949
So that's a quarter of a
century.

00:46:42.949 --> 00:46:44.389
That's a long time, right?
 

00:46:44.389 --> 00:46:46.440
It's longer than you've lived.
 

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:47.769
So here's van't Hoff.
 

00:46:47.769 --> 00:46:51.110
He had some opinion of himself.
 

00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:56.617
He won the first Nobel Prize --
I mean, he had a high opinion

00:46:56.617 --> 00:47:02.309
that was completely justified --
in 1901, the first Nobel Prize

00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:03.869
in Chemistry.
 

00:47:03.869 --> 00:47:06.262
And he didn't get it for this,
which he should've gotten it

00:47:06.262 --> 00:47:06.510
for.
 

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:09.280
He got for inventing physical
chemistry.

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:16.360
The most admired trait he had
was imagination.

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:18.139
So he liked poets and artists.
 

00:47:18.139 --> 00:47:22.460
In fact, his hero was Lord
Byron.

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:26.329
Look at that.
 

00:47:26.329 --> 00:47:28.630
Okay?
 

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:32.659
And in 1874,
as we said, he was a student.

00:47:32.659 --> 00:47:36.460
And he wrote this,
a pamphlet, in Dutch,

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:40.103
which was then translated into
German and called "The

00:47:40.103 --> 00:47:43.492
Arrangement of Atoms in
Space," and was published

00:47:43.492 --> 00:47:44.260
in 1877.
 

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:47.820
It was fifty-three pages long
and heavily illustrated.

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:50.340
And look at the website for
this.

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:53.940
One of the Wikis I've assigned
is that website.

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:59.208
And also this website about
criticism of van't Hoff by a guy

00:47:59.208 --> 00:48:00.460
named Kolbe.
 

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:01.730
So here's Hermann Kolbe.
 

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:04.956
He was twice,
more than twice van't Hoff's

00:48:04.956 --> 00:48:08.500
age, and a pillar of traditional
chemistry.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:12.030
He wrote, in a review of this
book: "It is completely

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:15.561
impossible to criticize this
booklet in any detail because

00:48:15.561 --> 00:48:19.030
the fancy trifles in it are
totally devoid of any factual

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:22.067
reality and are completely
incomprehensible to any

00:48:22.067 --> 00:48:24.050
clear-minded researcher.
 

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:27.996
The brochure begins with the
words: 'The modern chemical

00:48:27.996 --> 00:48:29.969
theory has two weak points.
 

00:48:29.969 --> 00:48:33.228
It says nothing either about
the relative position or the

00:48:33.228 --> 00:48:36.195
motion of the atoms within the
molecules.'"

00:48:36.195 --> 00:48:37.710
This is absurd,
right?

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:40.659
But he was wrong.
 

00:48:40.659 --> 00:48:41.679
Right?
 

00:48:41.679 --> 00:48:44.059
Now am I like Kekulé?
 

00:48:44.059 --> 00:48:46.550
Because I'm more than twice as
old as you are.

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:46.940
Right?
 

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:50.599
So those are three websites you
should read about this.

00:48:50.599 --> 00:48:53.416
But, in fact,
it's not true that van't Hoff

00:48:53.416 --> 00:48:55.900
was devoid of any factual
reality,

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:57.900
because we've already seen some
of his evidence,

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.420
and we'll see more next time.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.062
Prof: Today we're going
to talk about adaptive

00:00:03.062 --> 00:00:05.456
evolution,
and that means that today is

00:00:05.456 --> 00:00:09.093
going to be all about the
different kinds of natural

00:00:09.093 --> 00:00:11.090
selection that there are.
 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.359
It's going to be about the
vocabulary that evolutionary

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:16.720
biologists use to describe
selection.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.360
It's going to be about rates of
evolution,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.590
why evolution is sometimes very
fast,

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.507
sometimes very slow,
and it's going to be about the

00:00:26.507 --> 00:00:31.130
different contexts in which
selection occurs.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.200
So we'll talk a little bit
about sexual selection.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.005
We'll talk a little bit about
group and species selection,

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:36.940
things like that.
 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.392
All of these things that I
mention today are going to be

00:00:40.392 --> 00:00:42.150
coming up again and again.
 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.023
So this is just part of the
intellectual toolkit for dealing

00:00:47.023 --> 00:00:48.510
with the course.
 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.658
This is an outline of the
lecture, and since it's a whole

00:00:51.658 --> 00:00:54.975
lecture it's in pretty small
type, and I don't expect you to

00:00:54.975 --> 00:00:56.550
read that off the board.
 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.244
But I do want you to have it so
it makes it easy for you to

00:00:59.244 --> 00:01:01.938
review this when you download it
and you look at it in your

00:01:01.938 --> 00:01:03.844
notes,
because it does summarize the

00:01:03.844 --> 00:01:04.468
main points.
 

00:01:04.468 --> 00:01:08.665
Basically what I'm going to do
is tell you that evolution can

00:01:08.665 --> 00:01:11.742
be either adaptive,
in which case it has been

00:01:11.742 --> 00:01:14.959
driven by and shaped by natural
selection.

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:17.525
It can be neutral,
in which case it's been

00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:18.840
dominated by drift.
 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.319
Or it can be maladaptive.
 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:26.360
So evolution does not only
produce things that work well.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.965
Evolution produces things in
which stuff can go wrong,

00:01:31.965 --> 00:01:36.830
and sometimes evolution just
wanders around.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:43.200
Now adaptive evolution is not
about the survival of the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.379
fittest.
 

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:46.943
That is a phrase invented by
Herbert Spencer,

00:01:46.943 --> 00:01:50.263
in the nineteenth century,
that has had a long shelf life,

00:01:50.263 --> 00:01:51.370
and it's wrong.
 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.830
Adaptive evolution is about a
design for reproductive success.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.013
It's all about how many
children and grandchildren you

00:01:59.013 --> 00:02:02.558
have, and whether you do it
better than somebody else that's

00:02:02.558 --> 00:02:03.879
in the population.
 

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:05.790
It's always relative.
 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.546
Natural selection is like the
tale about the Buddhist monk and

00:02:10.546 --> 00:02:15.147
the disciple who were attacked
by the tiger and the disciple

00:02:15.147 --> 00:02:17.827
says to his master,
"Oh Master,

00:02:17.827 --> 00:02:20.348
we're going to be killed
because we cannot possibly

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:22.770
outrun the tiger,"
and the master says,

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.930
"No, I just have to run
faster than you."

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.580
Well, selection is always
relative;

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.098
it always depends on what the
picture is of reproductive

00:02:32.098 --> 00:02:37.110
success in that population at
the time that it's happening.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.842
Now I'm then going to discuss
when selection is strong and

00:02:40.842 --> 00:02:44.197
when it can be slow,
and I will tell you something

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:47.193
about the rate--
the units in which evolutionary

00:02:47.193 --> 00:02:50.866
rates are measured,
and then I'll run through types

00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:51.940
of selection.
 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.022
Now there are going to be two
questions that pose puzzles that

00:02:57.022 --> 00:02:59.190
come up in this lecture.
 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.658
One is going to be what will
happen,

00:03:01.658 --> 00:03:05.598
if directional selection
continues for a long time,

00:03:05.598 --> 00:03:08.289
can that continue,
and if it has to stop,

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:10.030
then why should it stop?
 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.073
And the other question will be
how can we explain that even

00:03:14.073 --> 00:03:17.490
though evolution can really be
extremely fast,

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.355
that sometimes things don't
change for hundreds of millions

00:03:21.355 --> 00:03:22.090
of years?
 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.015
So you have to be able to come
up with enough intellectual

00:03:26.015 --> 00:03:29.597
tools to be able to handle that
range of variation in

00:03:29.597 --> 00:03:31.318
evolutionary outcome.
 

00:03:31.318 --> 00:03:36.539
Both of those things really do
happen: nothing for a long

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:39.990
period of time,
or incredibly fast.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.258
So here's incredibly fast:
antibiotic resistance.

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:50.050
It is a curious and striking
cultural fact that in the United

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.986
States,
when people talk about

00:03:51.986 --> 00:03:54.313
antibiotic resistance in
television and in the

00:03:54.313 --> 00:03:56.538
newspapers,
they almost never mention the

00:03:56.538 --> 00:03:57.440
word 'evolution.'
 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.460
They say it emerges or it
develops.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.366
But, in fact,
this is the poster child for

00:04:07.366 --> 00:04:09.520
rapid evolution.
 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.435
You can see here roughly the
years in which antibiotic

00:04:14.435 --> 00:04:18.980
resistance emerged,
evolved, in these diseases.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:25.778
If we develop a new drug and
release it in the UK in 2009,

00:04:25.778 --> 00:04:30.677
resistant strains of bacteria
will have evolved and will be in

00:04:30.677 --> 00:04:33.970
hospitals in the UK within six
months,

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.255
and those resistant strains of
bacteria will be observed in

00:04:38.255 --> 00:04:41.360
hospitals in Hong Kong within
two years.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.514
The bacteria will have moved
around the earth as people move

00:04:44.514 --> 00:04:45.529
around the earth.
 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:48.262
The drug industry is in a
co-evolutionary arms race to try

00:04:48.262 --> 00:04:50.899
to keep up with the bacteria
that evolve resistance,

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:53.000
and we have gradually been
losing the arms race.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.329
So if you read in the
newspapers about multiply

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:59.658
resistant staphylococcus aureus,
which is MRSA,

00:04:59.658 --> 00:05:03.639
it is starting to crop up now
out in the community.

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.228
It's not just confined to
hospital emergency wards and

00:05:07.228 --> 00:05:11.019
intensive care units anymore,
it's starting to spread.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:16.040
And if staph aureus picks up
resistance to vancomycin,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.110
which is one of our last lines
of resistance against it,

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.132
it's going to be very difficult
for surgeons to do operations in

00:05:22.132 --> 00:05:24.915
the confidence that they can
keep their patients from dying

00:05:24.915 --> 00:05:26.259
after they have surgery.
 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.490
So this is serious stuff.
 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.800
Most resistant bacteria live in
hospitals,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.600
because that's where most
antibiotics are used,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.326
and the number of hospital
acquired infections is about two

00:05:42.326 --> 00:05:44.959
million per year in the United
States,

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:48.327
and it's estimated that about
90,000 people who did not have a

00:05:48.327 --> 00:05:51.420
bacterial infection when they
went into the hospital,

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.136
got into the hospital and then
died from that bacterial

00:05:54.136 --> 00:05:54.740
infection.
 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.870
And, in fact,
it looks like this is a serious

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.440
underestimate because this is
the official report,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.149
but if you look at what the
hospitals asked for,

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:03.750
in terms of money from the
insurance industry,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.439
it's about ten times higher
than that,

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:08.329
OK?
 

00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:11.862
So, by comparison,
this is how many people are

00:06:11.862 --> 00:06:15.629
dying in 2005 from AIDS in the
United States,

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:19.968
influenza and breast cancer,
and you take that and you

00:06:19.968 --> 00:06:24.797
multiply it to the planet and
you can see that the evolution

00:06:24.797 --> 00:06:29.300
of antibiotic resistance is a
pretty serious issue.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.035
The economic burden in the US
four years ago was eighty

00:06:33.035 --> 00:06:36.319
billion a year,
and this is a problem which is

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:39.649
caused by strong directional
natural selection,

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.970
eliciting a rapid evolutionary
response.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.935
So in the next few slides I'm
going to be talking about what I

00:06:45.935 --> 00:06:48.990
mean by directional and what I
mean by rapid.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.555
By rapid, in this case,
if you have a normal sized

00:06:59.555 --> 00:07:03.906
bacterial population in your
body and I give you an

00:07:03.906 --> 00:07:07.497
antibiotic,
the probability is that if you

00:07:07.497 --> 00:07:10.939
don't do your antibiotic
treatment correctly,

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:15.367
within about a week or two you
will have resistant bacteria in

00:07:15.367 --> 00:07:16.240
your body.
 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.232
Finish your antibiotic
treatments, never stop in the

00:07:20.232 --> 00:07:23.399
middle, OK;
kill them all off.

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:31.615
Here's a good example of rapid
evolution in nature in a fish in

00:07:31.615 --> 00:07:34.000
ecological time.
 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.072
It's one of a series of cases
that accumulated in the 1970s

00:07:39.072 --> 00:07:44.057
and 1980s that demonstrated that
evolution isn't all about

00:07:44.057 --> 00:07:47.237
dinosaurs,
and millions of years,

00:07:47.237 --> 00:07:49.360
and slow, steady change.
 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:55.680
Evolution in stuff like the
color of the male's body,

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.610
the number of babies the female
has,

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:02.471
how fast they grow--all kinds
of ecologically and behaviorally

00:08:02.471 --> 00:08:06.060
important properties can happen
real quick.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.790
This was done by doing an
experiment in which guppies

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.800
interacted with predators.
 

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.170
This is a cichlid fish
Crenicichla.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:18.663
This is the pike killifish
Rivulus, and it was done in

00:08:18.663 --> 00:08:22.819
Trinidad, by David Reznick who
is at Riverside.

00:08:22.819 --> 00:08:26.701
Now the setup in Trinidad
basically is that there is a

00:08:26.701 --> 00:08:30.290
mountain range on the north end
of the island,

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.735
and there are lots of little
streams that are going down the

00:08:33.735 --> 00:08:37.178
mountain range into a river and
they go over a waterfall.

00:08:37.178 --> 00:08:40.759
And the fact that the stream
goes over a waterfall has

00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:44.405
prevented the large predators
from getting up above the

00:08:44.405 --> 00:08:46.607
waterfall,
and above some of the

00:08:46.607 --> 00:08:48.759
waterfalls there were no fish at
all.

00:08:48.759 --> 00:08:52.299
So what Reznick did was he took
fish that had evolved for a long

00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:53.807
time,
with predators below the

00:08:53.807 --> 00:08:55.221
waterfalls,
and he put them above the

00:08:55.221 --> 00:08:57.220
waterfalls,
and he did replicates.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.220
It was a nice system.
 

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.000
There were lots of streams.
 

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.660
You could do it four or five
times, to make sure it was a

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:02.659
consistent pattern.
 

00:09:02.659 --> 00:09:04.288
And these are the results.
 

00:09:04.288 --> 00:09:06.942
The life history traits--that
means how big they are when

00:09:06.942 --> 00:09:09.994
they're born,
how old, and how large they are

00:09:09.994 --> 00:09:13.047
when they mature,
how many babies they have and

00:09:13.047 --> 00:09:17.600
how long they live--
all evolved rapidly.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.690
So they responded quickly.
 

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:23.844
The fastest rates of evolution
were measured in things that

00:09:23.844 --> 00:09:25.418
occur early in life.
 

00:09:25.418 --> 00:09:29.514
So the number of babies in the
first brood, how big the babies

00:09:29.514 --> 00:09:32.803
were in the first brood,
how fast the babies grew,

00:09:32.803 --> 00:09:34.750
that all changed quickly.
 

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.519
And basically the pattern was
this.

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:40.830
If the guppies are under a high
predation regime,

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.990
they mature earlier and they
have more smaller offspring,

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:47.865
they have a shorter life--this
all has something to do with the

00:09:47.865 --> 00:09:50.990
evolution of aging and why we
grow old and die--

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.070
and they had more smaller
offspring.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.500
Okay?
 

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.885
The males were less colorful
and they displayed more

00:09:58.885 --> 00:09:59.750
discretely.
 

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:03.129
Guppy courtship is normally a
fairly elaborate thing.

00:10:03.129 --> 00:10:06.250
The male, who you can see is
really brightly colored,

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.440
also has an elaborate display
behavior,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.975
and he will dance up in front
of the female and he will wave

00:10:13.975 --> 00:10:17.990
his fins back and forth and then
he will dart in and try to mate.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:23.788
And the females prefers males
who have bright orange spots.

00:10:23.788 --> 00:10:25.996
The bright orange spots
probably were originally a

00:10:25.996 --> 00:10:28.293
direct indication that the male
was good at catching

00:10:28.293 --> 00:10:30.525
crustaceans,
because crustaceans have

00:10:30.525 --> 00:10:31.808
carotenoids in them.
 

00:10:31.808 --> 00:10:34.836
So they catch amphipods and
shrimp and things like that,

00:10:34.836 --> 00:10:37.533
and then reprocess the
chemicals and they can make

00:10:37.533 --> 00:10:38.580
orange with it.
 

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.100
That was an indication that a
male was a good forager,

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.187
and so the female might select
that male because then her

00:10:44.187 --> 00:10:46.668
babies also would be good at
catching food.

00:10:46.668 --> 00:10:50.690
However, the male is dancing in
front of the female,

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.614
and that makes him a sitting
duck for Crenicichla (Pike

00:10:53.614 --> 00:10:57.080
Cichlids) And as we'll see a
little bit later in the lecture,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.111
sexual selection involves a
direct tradeoff between mating

00:11:00.111 --> 00:11:03.525
success and survival,
and these guys were displaying

00:11:03.525 --> 00:11:06.090
frantically to get mating
success,

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.879
at the risk of being snapped up
by a predator,

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:11.341
and the ones that survived were
the ones that simplified their

00:11:11.341 --> 00:11:12.419
display behavior.
 

00:11:12.419 --> 00:11:14.600
Okay?
 

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.570
So this all happened pretty
quick.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.450
Now how do we measure it?
 

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.307
Well currently--and there's
been a bit of controversy about

00:11:24.307 --> 00:11:26.586
this--
but currently the preferred

00:11:26.586 --> 00:11:28.850
unit of measurement is a
haldane,

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:34.115
and a haldane is a change in
the mean value of the population

00:11:34.115 --> 00:11:37.889
by one standard deviation per
generation.

00:11:37.889 --> 00:11:41.227
So I'm going to tell you what a
standard deviation is,

00:11:41.227 --> 00:11:44.000
and I'm going to tell you who
Haldane was.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.976
Haldane was the son of the Lord
Admiral of the British Navy who

00:11:49.976 --> 00:11:54.409
commanded the British Navy in
World War One.

00:11:54.409 --> 00:11:57.178
And he was a brilliant polymath.
 

00:11:57.178 --> 00:12:01.154
He was fluent in Greek and
Latin, as well as mathematics

00:12:01.154 --> 00:12:04.232
and biology,
and he did foundational work in

00:12:04.232 --> 00:12:06.870
biochemistry and on the origin
of life,

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.940
as well as in population
genetics.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.643
For many years he was a
professor at University College,

00:12:13.643 --> 00:12:14.250
London.
 

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:18.570
He was a Communist and a
Socialist,

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.676
and a social reformer,
who had a romance with the

00:12:21.676 --> 00:12:25.431
Soviet Union and then became
bitterly disillusioned when he

00:12:25.431 --> 00:12:29.250
discovered what had gone on in
the gulags in the 1950s.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:34.383
When he got intestinal cancer
he retired from his position in

00:12:34.383 --> 00:12:39.004
London and he took a job in
India and he taught a whole

00:12:39.004 --> 00:12:43.624
generation of population
geneticists in India before he

00:12:43.624 --> 00:12:45.250
died in 1962.
 

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:48.851
A very interesting guy,
and actually there is a lot

00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:52.957
about the social impact of
science that you can learn from

00:12:52.957 --> 00:12:55.480
reading about J.B.S. Haldane.
 

00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:02.100
The biography is just called
JBS.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.940
This is a standard deviation.
 

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:10.495
It is an empirical observation,
supported by an elementary

00:13:10.495 --> 00:13:14.200
theorem of mathematical
statistics,

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:19.028
called the Central Limit
Theorem, that most population

00:13:19.028 --> 00:13:23.220
distributions look like a
bell-shaped curve.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.620
It's called the normal
distribution.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.945
It was formalized by Gauss;
sometimes it's called a

00:13:30.945 --> 00:13:32.440
Gaussian distribution.
 

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:37.423
And the shape of the curve and
its spread are basically

00:13:37.423 --> 00:13:40.840
measured by the standard
deviation.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.461
So the mean value is at the
center here and the distribution

00:13:45.461 --> 00:13:49.205
is theoretically symmetrical--
in practice it's

00:13:49.205 --> 00:13:53.660
quasi-symmetrical--
and the degree of spread is

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:58.190
measured by the standard
deviation units.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:02.212
So within 1 standard deviation
you will find,

00:14:02.212 --> 00:14:06.236
on each side,
34.1, or with both 68.2% of all

00:14:06.236 --> 00:14:10.808
of the individuals observed in
the population.

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:16.217
So 1 haldane basically would
take a population that say had a

00:14:16.217 --> 00:14:20.250
mean value--
suppose it was for body size,

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:25.520
maybe a body size of 10 grams--
and if it had a standard

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.754
deviation of 2 grams,
and it was evolving at a rate

00:14:29.754 --> 00:14:32.442
of 1 haldane,
it would move that mean from

00:14:32.442 --> 00:14:35.152
here to here;
1 standard deviation unit up,

00:14:35.152 --> 00:14:38.184
and the population mean in the
next generation,

00:14:38.184 --> 00:14:41.350
instead of being 10 grams,
would be 12 grams.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.460
So that's the meaning of the
haldane.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.009
Here are some measured haldanes.
 

00:14:47.009 --> 00:14:48.250
Okay?
 

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.208
So for those guppies in
Trinidad, that were evolving

00:14:51.208 --> 00:14:54.167
pretty fast,
the number of spots in the area

00:14:54.167 --> 00:14:57.980
of orange spots--
when you took away the predator

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.931
and suddenly being brightly
colored wasn't risky anymore and

00:15:02.931 --> 00:15:06.571
females liked it;
so it was good to be brightly

00:15:06.571 --> 00:15:09.750
colored--those spot numbers
increased quickly.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:13.840
They were increasing at about
.7 haldanes.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.168
In the Galapagos finches that
Peter and Rosemary Grant

00:15:17.168 --> 00:15:19.940
studied,
they go through El Nino,

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.384
and during El Nino--
it's a strong selective event,

00:15:23.384 --> 00:15:26.418
so about every ten years
there's a strong selective event

00:15:26.418 --> 00:15:30.197
on the Galapagos finches--
and during El Nino they were

00:15:30.197 --> 00:15:33.669
evolving at about .7 haldanes in
body size;

00:15:33.669 --> 00:15:34.980
they're getting bigger.
 

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.990
And then in the other years
they were getting smaller.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.389
So they fluctuate,
they go up and down,

00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:42.990
depending upon the El Nino
conditions in the Galapagos.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:47.058
There have also been lots of
measurements of slower rates;

00:15:47.058 --> 00:15:49.666
for example,
since the extinction of their

00:15:49.666 --> 00:15:53.163
competitors in the late
nineteenth century the surviving

00:15:53.163 --> 00:15:57.106
Hawaiian honeycreeper,
the I'iwi has been evolving a

00:15:57.106 --> 00:16:01.869
shorter bill,
and that's been a very slow

00:16:01.869 --> 00:16:04.408
rate of evolution.
 

00:16:04.408 --> 00:16:07.725
The migratory timing of
Columbia River salmon has been

00:16:07.725 --> 00:16:10.980
changing as a result of the
human fishery on them.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:15.206
All of the fished populations
of the world are evolving under

00:16:15.206 --> 00:16:17.460
the pressure of human fishing.
 

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.330
Most of the fish in the world
are getting smaller.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.798
Many of the stocks are
collapsing.

00:16:21.798 --> 00:16:25.241
It's producing a change in the
time of year that the Columbia

00:16:25.241 --> 00:16:27.250
River salmon run up the
Columbia.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:30.244
This is also due to the
building of dams on the

00:16:30.244 --> 00:16:30.960
Columbia.
 

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.360
So this is a human induced
selection process.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.870
These are fairly slow rates.
 

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:40.466
So what does this mean,
if we just try to think about

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:44.450
these rates and evolutionary
times?

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:49.011
A Galapagos finch is about 25
grams, about the size of a house

00:16:49.011 --> 00:16:49.759
sparrow.
 

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:57.330
They evolved during El Nino at
about half a gram a year.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.899
What if the El Nino conditions
persisted forever?

00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:03.783
What if it wasn't the southern
oscillation that was driving the

00:17:03.783 --> 00:17:05.460
rainfall pattern in the
Galapagos?

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:10.383
What if it just stayed warm and
wet for a long time in the

00:17:10.383 --> 00:17:11.420
Galapagos?
 

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.887
Well that would produce
directional selection,

00:17:14.887 --> 00:17:19.589
and if you did it for a hundred
years, it would turn a 25 gram

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.980
finch into a 75 gram finch.
 

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.279
Basically it would take a finch
and turn it into a small robin.

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:27.038
Okay?
 

00:17:27.038 --> 00:17:32.308
If you did it for 10,000 years,
it would turn it into a turkey.

00:17:32.308 --> 00:17:40.506
Now finches as big as turkeys
don't do very well in a finch

00:17:40.506 --> 00:17:41.920
habitat.
 

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.940
They are living in a place
where they hop around in bushes.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.273
They are living in an
environment in which food is

00:17:49.273 --> 00:17:51.519
sometimes very hard to come by.
 

00:17:51.519 --> 00:17:55.179
I've been observing the turkeys
that live near my garden in

00:17:55.179 --> 00:17:57.419
Hamden,
trying to get up into the trees

00:17:57.419 --> 00:18:00.637
next to Lake Whitney to pick the
berries off as winter has come

00:18:00.637 --> 00:18:02.299
on and it's gotten very cold.
 

00:18:02.299 --> 00:18:05.420
They're pretty clumsy.
 

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:13.883
So what will happen if you keep
a strong directional selection

00:18:13.883 --> 00:18:16.519
going on finches?
 

00:18:16.519 --> 00:18:20.086
What would happen to humans if
there were strong directional

00:18:20.086 --> 00:18:22.930
selection on humans to increase
in body size?

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:29.550
What would happen if we got
turned from say 50 to 80 kilo

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:33.690
primates into three-ton
primates?

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:36.460
How long could that go on?
 

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.226
One of the fastest rates of
evolution ever measured in the

00:18:39.226 --> 00:18:41.943
fossil record was when elephants
went onto islands in the

00:18:41.943 --> 00:18:44.807
Mediterranean and turned from
twelve-ton elephants down into

00:18:44.807 --> 00:18:47.088
things about the size of a Saint
Bernard.

00:18:47.088 --> 00:18:47.586
Okay?
 

00:18:47.586 --> 00:18:51.558
They did it in less than
100,000 years.

00:18:51.558 --> 00:18:54.595
They did it because they were
food limited and they'd been

00:18:54.595 --> 00:18:56.460
released from predation
pressure.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.789
Okay?
 

00:18:57.789 --> 00:19:01.818
So how far can that process go?
 

00:19:01.818 --> 00:19:04.940
These are quick changes that
we're describing.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.548
The finches are moving pretty
fast.

00:19:06.548 --> 00:19:07.808
The guppies are moving pretty
fast.

00:19:07.808 --> 00:19:09.318
The elephants change pretty
quickly.

00:19:09.318 --> 00:19:12.558
But if you look over the whole
spread of evolutionary time,

00:19:12.558 --> 00:19:13.940
over hundreds of millions of
years,

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:18.460
things stay within a fairly
narrow envelope of body sizes.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.680
Why does that happen?
 

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.402
So if we look at
microevolutionary rates--and by

00:19:25.402 --> 00:19:28.568
the way there are good papers on
this.

00:19:28.568 --> 00:19:31.048
If you're interested in rates,
this is a good paper topic.

00:19:31.048 --> 00:19:35.769
Umm, lots of measurements,
lots of argument about why.

00:19:35.769 --> 00:19:40.269
They vary from very fast to
very slow.

00:19:40.269 --> 00:19:44.098
The fastest are in the finches
and in the Trinidad guppies.

00:19:44.098 --> 00:19:46.656
There have been lots of rates
measured in Hawaiian

00:19:46.656 --> 00:19:48.848
mosquitofish and Hawaiian
honeycreepers.

00:19:48.848 --> 00:19:51.098
So there are lots of estimates
available.

00:19:51.098 --> 00:19:54.184
And interestingly,
the shorter the period over

00:19:54.184 --> 00:19:58.230
which the rate is measured,
the greater the maximum rate.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.751
So if you measure a rate by
making comparisons between two

00:20:00.751 --> 00:20:03.273
populations that have been
separated for hundreds of years

00:20:03.273 --> 00:20:06.403
or hundreds of generations,
it's usually fairly slow,

00:20:06.403 --> 00:20:10.380
and if you focus in and you
just look at a brief period,

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:14.789
it can be very fast.
 

00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:19.308
Why do you think that might be?
 

00:20:19.308 --> 00:20:22.755
Why might we measure a faster
rate when we do so over a

00:20:22.755 --> 00:20:24.349
shorter period of time?
 

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.859
If we measure it over a short
period of time,

00:20:45.859 --> 00:20:47.170
sometimes it's faster.
 

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.553
If we measure it over a long
period of time,

00:20:49.553 --> 00:20:50.328
it's slower.
 

00:20:50.328 --> 00:20:52.516
Does that suggest anything
about what the pattern might

00:20:52.516 --> 00:20:54.460
look like that I'm about to draw
on the board?

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:54.970
Yes?
 

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:56.847
Student: 
&gt;

00:20:56.847 --> 00:20:59.460
So it can go up and down,
and &gt;

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.359
Prof: You got it,
that's all it takes.

00:21:01.359 --> 00:21:04.430
It just has to go up and down.
 

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:09.528
If I measure it over this
period, it looks pretty fast.

00:21:09.528 --> 00:21:14.859
If I measure it over this
period, it looks pretty slow.

00:21:14.859 --> 00:21:19.700
That's all it is.
 

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:28.512
Okay, the take-home message,
from many studies done in the

00:21:28.512 --> 00:21:30.924
'70s,
'80s and '90s,

00:21:30.924 --> 00:21:35.962
is that evolution can be very
fast when populations are large

00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:38.230
and selection is strong.
 

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.777
And the reason for that is that
big populations have lots of

00:21:41.777 --> 00:21:42.980
genetic variation.
 

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:46.660
So there's a potential for a
big response to selection.

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:50.180
Small populations don't have so
much genetic variation.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:56.209
So even though selection might
be strong, they can't respond so

00:21:56.209 --> 00:21:56.890
well.
 

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:00.056
This point, the shorter the
time interval over which you

00:22:00.056 --> 00:22:02.818
measure the rate,
the higher the maximum rate.

00:22:02.818 --> 00:22:06.981
And here's one reason why you
can't take Galapagos finches and

00:22:06.981 --> 00:22:11.212
turn them into turkeys and then
turn the turkeys into ostriches

00:22:11.212 --> 00:22:15.580
and then turn the ostriches into
moas and then have the moas turn

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.559
into tyrannosaurus rex.
 

00:22:17.559 --> 00:22:21.400
Okay?
 

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.818
As you push things very far,
in any direction,

00:22:24.818 --> 00:22:29.074
there's an internal process
that converts the directional

00:22:29.074 --> 00:22:32.190
selection into stabilizing
selection.

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.750
And those are the tradeoffs,
the linkages among traits.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:37.720
If you try to make a finch very
large,

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:43.700
then although it may be gaining
something in terms of say food

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.910
capturing ability,
it is giving up maneuverability.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:55.798
If you try to take elephants
and make them very small,

00:22:55.798 --> 00:22:59.824
then at some point they are not
going to be able to compete with

00:22:59.824 --> 00:23:03.488
other elephants for food supply,
even though there may not be

00:23:03.488 --> 00:23:04.558
any predators there.
 

00:23:04.558 --> 00:23:08.141
There are all kinds of
biomechanical linkages within

00:23:08.141 --> 00:23:10.808
bodies where tradeoffs are
involved.

00:23:10.808 --> 00:23:13.470
So if you look within the
organism,

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.608
you see that it's a bundle of
linkages and compromises,

00:23:16.608 --> 00:23:21.136
and every time you try to
change one trait you have a

00:23:21.136 --> 00:23:24.281
byproduct,
you have an implicit selection

00:23:24.281 --> 00:23:26.019
going on,
on other traits.

00:23:26.019 --> 00:23:30.890
So although you may be
realizing a benefit in one,

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:35.858
or a place, you are paying a
cost in the others.

00:23:35.858 --> 00:23:40.711
The most striking example we've
seen of it in the lecture so far

00:23:40.711 --> 00:23:43.098
is the guppy,
the male guppy.

00:23:43.098 --> 00:23:47.452
If he evolves to be bright and
a wonderful dancer,

00:23:47.452 --> 00:23:51.182
so that females just love to
mate with him,

00:23:51.182 --> 00:23:54.470
he will get killed by a
predator.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.455
That is about as
straightforward and brutal a

00:23:57.455 --> 00:23:59.355
tradeoff as you can imagine.
 

00:23:59.355 --> 00:23:59.900
Okay?
 

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.342
But these go on all over the
place and some of them are very

00:24:04.342 --> 00:24:05.019
subtle.
 

00:24:05.019 --> 00:24:10.634
Now why is it that sometimes
traits evolve very fast and

00:24:10.634 --> 00:24:12.880
sometimes very slow?
 

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.660
This is a picture of clubmoss,
lycopodium.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.839
If I were to take you out into
the woods of Connecticut in the

00:24:19.839 --> 00:24:21.786
springtime,
you would see them all over the

00:24:21.786 --> 00:24:23.540
place,
and if I were to put you a time

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.680
machine and take you back 400
million years,

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.838
they wouldn't look any
different.

00:24:30.838 --> 00:24:33.769
This is latimeria,
this is a Coelacanth.

00:24:33.769 --> 00:24:37.642
If I were to put you into a
research submarine off the

00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:41.441
Comoro Islands in the strait
between South Africa and

00:24:41.441 --> 00:24:44.452
Madagascar,
between Malawi and Madagascar,

00:24:44.452 --> 00:24:48.261
and we went down at night to a
depth of 300 to 600 feet off the

00:24:48.261 --> 00:24:51.453
volcanic slope of the island,
we would find these guys

00:24:51.453 --> 00:24:52.910
cruising around in mid-water.
 

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:57.180
They have spent the day in
caves and they come out at

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.509
night,
into the mid-waters of the

00:24:59.509 --> 00:25:03.759
earth's oceans,
and apparently they have been

00:25:03.759 --> 00:25:08.960
doing this now for going on 150
million years.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.769
They haven't changed at all.
 

00:25:11.769 --> 00:25:15.940
By the way, they have an egg
the size of an orange.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.200
They're interesting.
 

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.220
They're, they're pretty
effective predators too.

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:23.028
They are, uh, ambush predators.
 

00:25:23.028 --> 00:25:26.915
They drift around and then they
suck things into their mouths by

00:25:26.915 --> 00:25:29.259
a big kind of vacuum suction
device.

00:25:29.259 --> 00:25:31.009
It's a common method of fish
feeding.

00:25:31.009 --> 00:25:33.450
So they're living fossils.
 

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:36.180
Now why haven't they changed?
 

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:41.920
Look at what's happened to
their relatives.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:47.259
The clubmosses had relatives at
the time that looked about like

00:25:47.259 --> 00:25:50.019
them,
that since then have turned

00:25:50.019 --> 00:25:56.546
into redwood trees,
orchids, wheat fields--you name

00:25:56.546 --> 00:25:59.890
it,
these guys still look the same.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:09.221
Latimeria had relatives that
since then have turned into

00:26:09.221 --> 00:26:16.180
marlin and reptiles and birds,
mammals;

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.900
it hasn't changed.
 

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.098
So we have these two things to
understand.

00:26:22.098 --> 00:26:26.423
We have to understand how
evolution can go really

00:26:26.423 --> 00:26:31.196
fast--antibiotic resistance,
guppies, finches--and why

00:26:31.196 --> 00:26:33.720
sometimes it is so slow.
 

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.220
Any ideas on this one?
 

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:49.805
Is this the first time you've
hit this problem of why

00:26:49.805 --> 00:26:52.759
evolution is sometimes so slow?
 

00:26:52.759 --> 00:26:56.471
Student:  It finds a
pretty stable way of living and

00:26:56.471 --> 00:27:00.182
surviving, and sometimes way
down below depths of the ocean

00:27:00.182 --> 00:27:01.846
&gt;.
 

00:27:01.846 --> 00:27:05.108
Might not that change the
effect of latimeria?

00:27:05.108 --> 00:27:06.960
And the clubmoss are in
&gt;

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.393
for hundreds of millions of
years, while

00:27:09.393 --> 00:27:11.140
&gt;.
 

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.568
Prof: Right.
 

00:27:12.568 --> 00:27:15.356
Okay, that's one kind of
explanation, and I think it's

00:27:15.356 --> 00:27:16.828
certainly a plausible one.
 

00:27:16.828 --> 00:27:19.190
It's not the only one,
but it's certainly one kind.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:22.616
So his argument is the reason
these guys haven't changed is

00:27:22.616 --> 00:27:26.045
that they're really good at
always finding the same kind of

00:27:26.045 --> 00:27:29.018
environment,
so that they are never exposed

00:27:29.018 --> 00:27:29.740
to change.
 

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.417
So if their environment moves
around the globe,

00:27:32.417 --> 00:27:33.348
they track it.
 

00:27:33.348 --> 00:27:36.053
Now remember,
between 140 million years ago

00:27:36.053 --> 00:27:39.594
and now, the earth went through
a huge meteorite strike,

00:27:39.594 --> 00:27:41.588
the dinosaurs went extinct.
 

00:27:41.588 --> 00:27:45.128
Heavy stuff happened back there
at the end of the cretaceous,

00:27:45.128 --> 00:27:48.314
and latimeria just cruised
around and it hasn't changed

00:27:48.314 --> 00:27:49.140
very much.
 

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.871
Now the argument is actually
probably most convincing for

00:27:52.871 --> 00:27:55.767
marine invertebrates,
that make larvae that can go

00:27:55.767 --> 00:27:58.640
out and spread through the ocean
for thousands of kilometers.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.817
And, in fact,
we know from the behavior of

00:28:00.817 --> 00:28:03.742
marine invertebrate larvae--
so now I'm talking about worms,

00:28:03.742 --> 00:28:06.073
barnacles,
clams, stuff like that--that

00:28:06.073 --> 00:28:09.763
they like to settle on places
where there are successfully

00:28:09.763 --> 00:28:12.288
growing adults of their own
species.

00:28:12.288 --> 00:28:15.150
They smell that out very
carefully, and that's where they

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:15.608
settle.
 

00:28:15.608 --> 00:28:18.834
So basically the larvae are
selecting the habitat in which

00:28:18.834 --> 00:28:21.720
the adults will be selected by
natural selection.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:25.095
That means that they manage
themselves to generate

00:28:25.095 --> 00:28:29.160
stabilizing selection over
hundreds of millions of years.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:34.078
That's, and arguably latimeria
has done the same thing.

00:28:34.078 --> 00:28:37.787
It's been living in lava tubes
on the sides of submarine

00:28:37.787 --> 00:28:40.887
volcanoes at 300 to 1000 feet,
for a long time,

00:28:40.887 --> 00:28:43.720
and that habitat's always been
around.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:48.058
Any idea for another
explanation of stasis?

00:28:48.058 --> 00:28:51.078
That's an externalist
explanation.

00:28:51.078 --> 00:28:51.720
Okay?
 

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.885
It relies on aspects of the
habitat and the way natural

00:28:54.885 --> 00:28:57.348
selection is operating on the
organisms.

00:28:57.348 --> 00:29:00.500
Anybody got an idea for an
internalist explanation?

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.808
Yes?
 

00:29:01.808 --> 00:29:06.578
Student: There are
genetic mechanisms that will

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:11.710
regulate DNA copying and improve
&gt;

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:13.150
application.
 

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:16.499
Prof: I very much doubt
that a lack of mutations was

00:29:16.499 --> 00:29:19.038
ever the reason that things
didn't change.

00:29:19.038 --> 00:29:26.174
You've got 4.6 in you that're
new since your mom and dad,

00:29:26.174 --> 00:29:27.960
for example.
 

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.278
Yes?
 

00:29:29.278 --> 00:29:32.028
Student: All populations
are a &gt;

00:29:32.028 --> 00:29:33.984
Prof: Well,
yeah, the problem with that

00:29:33.984 --> 00:29:36.636
over a long period of time Greg
is that if it's really a small

00:29:36.636 --> 00:29:38.680
population it's more likely to
go extinct,

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.494
and these things are out there
for hundreds of millions of

00:29:40.494 --> 00:29:40.750
years.
 

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:43.619
So that one's a little
difficult.

00:29:43.619 --> 00:29:47.740
Other ideas?
 

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.805
Well there's a whole school of
thought that says that this kind

00:29:50.805 --> 00:29:53.130
of thing is due to developmental
constraints;

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:58.059
that development has
constrained the organisms so

00:29:58.059 --> 00:30:02.578
that they couldn't evolve in
certain ways.

00:30:02.578 --> 00:30:06.192
And that's plausible for
certain major features of the

00:30:06.192 --> 00:30:08.631
body plan,
that are determined very early

00:30:08.631 --> 00:30:11.193
in development,
and involve developmental

00:30:11.193 --> 00:30:14.160
tissue relationships and things
like that,

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.200
that are obviously hard to
change.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:20.846
It's not so plausible for some
of the smaller details of these

00:30:20.846 --> 00:30:21.759
creatures.
 

00:30:21.759 --> 00:30:26.355
So I think that the actual
explanation is probably a

00:30:26.355 --> 00:30:28.700
mixture of these things.
 

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.855
There probably is some
phylogenetic or developmental

00:30:31.855 --> 00:30:32.660
constraint.
 

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.348
Things that happened a long
time ago,

00:30:34.348 --> 00:30:37.279
in the way organisms were
built, are hard to change,

00:30:37.279 --> 00:30:40.424
and they've been constraining
the things that can change more

00:30:40.424 --> 00:30:40.950
rapidly.
 

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:44.108
But I think you'll find,
if you get into this,

00:30:44.108 --> 00:30:47.900
that it's a huge and
controversial literature on it.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.750
Okay.
 

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:53.798
Kinds of selection.
 

00:30:53.798 --> 00:30:57.795
Now we go through another one
of these vocabulary building

00:30:57.795 --> 00:31:01.650
exercises, and I'll try to
illustrate a few of these.

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:04.997
But I just want to get these
words out there and I want to

00:31:04.997 --> 00:31:08.755
get them into your minds so that
you can start to think about the

00:31:08.755 --> 00:31:11.866
fact that natural selection
comes in lots of different

00:31:11.866 --> 00:31:12.690
flavors.
 

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:15.967
We can talk about directional,
stabilizing and disruptive

00:31:15.967 --> 00:31:18.289
selection;
natural and sexual selection;

00:31:18.289 --> 00:31:21.305
frequency dependent selection;
and then selection acting on

00:31:21.305 --> 00:31:24.048
individuals, on kin,
on groups and on species.

00:31:24.048 --> 00:31:28.208
So each of these is cutting the
selection cake in a different

00:31:28.208 --> 00:31:31.348
direction;
but it is all of these

00:31:31.348 --> 00:31:33.240
different things.
 

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:36.690
So, directional,
stabilizing and disruptive.

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:40.604
Basically what's going on with
directional selection,

00:31:40.604 --> 00:31:44.142
that's making the Galapagos
finch into a turkey,

00:31:44.142 --> 00:31:47.380
is that the fitness gradient is
linear.

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:51.315
That means that if the fitness
of something over here is low

00:31:51.315 --> 00:31:54.006
and up here is high,
that means that natural

00:31:54.006 --> 00:31:56.368
selection is selecting for say
bigger things--

00:31:56.368 --> 00:31:59.880
this body size on the X-axis is
going to the right--

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.461
and it will take a distribution
that looks like this and it will

00:32:03.461 --> 00:32:04.769
move it to the right.
 

00:32:04.769 --> 00:32:09.942
So if this is 1 standard
deviation, then this amount of

00:32:09.942 --> 00:32:13.390
movement is 1 haldane,
right here.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:17.192
Stabilizing selection is
actually what we were just

00:32:17.192 --> 00:32:21.298
invoking to argue that the
coelacanth didn't change.

00:32:21.298 --> 00:32:23.990
It was living in a habitat
where it was always good to be

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:26.702
like a coelacanth,
and natural selection was

00:32:26.702 --> 00:32:30.519
selecting out things that didn't
look like coelacanths;

00:32:30.519 --> 00:32:32.622
whether they were larger or
smaller, or their fins were

00:32:32.622 --> 00:32:34.180
different shapes,
or things like that.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.650
So they tended to stay the same.
 

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:39.362
That means that we were
selecting for the mean of the

00:32:39.362 --> 00:32:43.288
population and we were
discarding the extreme values.

00:32:43.288 --> 00:32:50.210
Who in the room is under 5'5,
and also who in the room is

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:51.569
over 6'1?
 

00:32:51.569 --> 00:32:53.509
Raise your hands please.
 

00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:56.262
Okay, if there's stabilizing
selection on human height--you

00:32:56.262 --> 00:32:57.640
guys have no grandchildren.
 

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.410
Can I see the hands of
everybody else?

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:03.539
Hey, you made it.
 

00:33:03.539 --> 00:33:04.259
Okay?
 

00:33:04.259 --> 00:33:06.940
That's stabilizing selection.
 

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:11.682
It means selection for the mean
value, and it's selection

00:33:11.682 --> 00:33:13.630
against the extremes.
 

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:16.894
Be happy that that doesn't
appear to be the only thing

00:33:16.894 --> 00:33:18.190
going on in humans.
 

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:21.391
Disruptive selection is
selection against the mean and

00:33:21.391 --> 00:33:25.086
for the extremes,
and it will take a bell-shape

00:33:25.086 --> 00:33:28.526
curve like this,
it will knock out the mean

00:33:28.526 --> 00:33:32.611
value, and then the next
generation it will push it apart

00:33:32.611 --> 00:33:33.559
like that.
 

00:33:33.559 --> 00:33:34.538
Okay?
 

00:33:34.538 --> 00:33:38.486
So if we look for examples,
strong directional selection

00:33:38.486 --> 00:33:41.068
will produce very rapid
evolution.

00:33:41.068 --> 00:33:44.579
We saw that with antibiotic
resistance and the guppies.

00:33:44.579 --> 00:33:46.960
It can't continue.
 

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:50.190
It usually gets converted into
stabilizing selection.

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:54.198
Disruptive selection causes,
historically,

00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:59.771
things like the conversion of
similar looking gametes into

00:33:59.771 --> 00:34:02.509
quite different gametes.
 

00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:06.019
So disruptive selection was
involved in the origin of eggs

00:34:06.019 --> 00:34:08.132
and sperm,
back in the day,

00:34:08.132 --> 00:34:12.418
about a billion years ago,
and it may play a role in

00:34:12.418 --> 00:34:17.152
sympatric speciation;
which we will come to,

00:34:17.152 --> 00:34:21.219
um, probably in mid-February.
 

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:24.460
So just remember that.
 

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.934
Disruptive selection is
selection to take a population

00:34:27.934 --> 00:34:31.932
that has a certain mean value
and split it in half and turn it

00:34:31.932 --> 00:34:33.900
into two different things.
 

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.429
Now, natural and sexual
selection.

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:40.780
We've referred to sexual
selection with the guppy.

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:45.079
The classic example of sexual
selection is a peacock's tail.

00:34:45.079 --> 00:34:47.710
This is actually what inspired
Darwin to come up with the

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:48.179
concept.
 

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:49.539
He said, "Look at that
peacock.

00:34:49.539 --> 00:34:52.108
There isn't any reason,
from the point of view of

00:34:52.108 --> 00:34:54.532
survival,
for a male peacock to be that

00:34:54.532 --> 00:34:56.581
colorful,
and have that big a tail,

00:34:56.581 --> 00:34:59.929
and have this absolutely exotic
behavior of dancing around,

00:34:59.929 --> 00:35:01.300
waving its tail."
 

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.907
And, in fact,
if you look at the birds of

00:35:03.907 --> 00:35:06.262
paradise,
the amazing thing about the

00:35:06.262 --> 00:35:09.119
birds of paradise is not really
their feathers,

00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:11.500
it's what they do with their
feathers.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.619
They do fan dances with their
feathers.

00:35:14.619 --> 00:35:16.188
They can do the rumba,
they can shake,

00:35:16.188 --> 00:35:17.250
they can rock and roll.
 

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:20.239
They do all kinds of stuff,
and they're all dangerous,

00:35:20.239 --> 00:35:23.340
because they're out there
displaying and predators could

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.920
come along and eat them.
 

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.219
Okay?
 

00:35:26.219 --> 00:35:29.445
In fact, peacocks are eaten by
tigers, or they were eaten by

00:35:29.445 --> 00:35:32.670
tigers before the tiger just
about went extinct in India;

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:35.860
they're down to a few hundred
in India, and the Siberian tiger

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.900
is under threat right now in
Siberia.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.360
But the tigers traditionally
ate peacocks.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.929
They really did.
 

00:35:41.929 --> 00:35:44.619
So the display behavior was
dangerous.

00:35:44.619 --> 00:35:49.875
So what the male was doing was
he was trading off survival for

00:35:49.875 --> 00:35:51.340
mating success.
 

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:54.579
He was a victim of female
preferences.

00:35:54.579 --> 00:35:58.480
&gt;
 

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.992
Don't tell that to the
fraternity guys,

00:36:01.992 --> 00:36:02.639
okay?
 

00:36:02.639 --> 00:36:08.179
So, sexual selection is a
component of natural selection.

00:36:08.179 --> 00:36:10.380
Natural selection is all about
variation in reproductive

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.010
success,
and you can achieve

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:15.706
reproductive success by mating
and by surviving and by doing

00:36:15.706 --> 00:36:16.710
other things.
 

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:20.679
Okay, so it's a component of
natural selection.

00:36:20.679 --> 00:36:25.780
And the tradeoff involved is
survival versus mating.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.820
It's driven by two things.
 

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:32.849
Either ma--either the males are
competing with each other for

00:36:32.849 --> 00:36:36.206
access to females,
or the females are conniving

00:36:36.206 --> 00:36:39.059
against each other for access to
males--

00:36:39.059 --> 00:36:42.472
one of those processes may
drive intelligence a little bit

00:36:42.472 --> 00:36:46.813
more than the other--
and it's also driven by members

00:36:46.813 --> 00:36:51.018
of one sex choosing mates of the
other sex.

00:36:51.018 --> 00:36:53.570
So we're going to have a whole
lecture on sexual selection.

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:56.199
It's often fun to write a paper
on this topic.

00:36:56.199 --> 00:37:02.103
There are several criteria that
one sex might use in choosing a

00:37:02.103 --> 00:37:02.769
mate.
 

00:37:02.769 --> 00:37:05.289
One is a direct benefit.
 

00:37:05.289 --> 00:37:08.605
So with birds that would be,
"Oh, that male's got a

00:37:08.605 --> 00:37:11.860
really good territory,
it's got a lot of food in it;

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.715
therefore I could have a lot of
babies and raise them there,

00:37:14.715 --> 00:37:16.750
so I'll go live in that
territory."

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:19.054
Not so directly looking at the
male, just saying,

00:37:19.054 --> 00:37:21.550
"Oh, he happens to hold
that territory."

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:23.719
That would be a direct benefit.
 

00:37:23.719 --> 00:37:27.097
Or you could say,
"Oh my goodness,

00:37:27.097 --> 00:37:28.518
isn't he sexy?
 

00:37:28.518 --> 00:37:32.382
If I mate with him,
my sons are going to be sexy

00:37:32.382 --> 00:37:33.369
too."
 

00:37:33.369 --> 00:37:34.849
&gt;
 

00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:37.340
That's called the sexy-son
hypothesis,

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:41.876
and actually it does appear to
drive some of the more

00:37:41.876 --> 00:37:46.681
extravagant displays,
and is probably responsible for

00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:50.880
the evolutionary shaping of the
peacock's tail.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:55.695
A third hypothesis is,
"Oh he's resistant to

00:37:55.695 --> 00:38:00.688
disease,
and he happens to be wearing a

00:38:00.688 --> 00:38:05.889
piece of morphology,
that I can detect externally,

00:38:05.889 --> 00:38:09.619
that tells me that he's
resistant to disease;

00:38:09.619 --> 00:38:13.264
because it's expensive to
produce and only resistant males

00:38:13.264 --> 00:38:16.590
are capable developmentally of
producing it."

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:18.750
There's an interesting
principle involved in that.

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:24.139
Basically it is that honest
signals are costly.

00:38:24.139 --> 00:38:25.980
Okay?
 

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:29.469
And if disease resistance is
costly and you can advertise

00:38:29.469 --> 00:38:33.460
your resistance with a signal
that you are disease resistant,

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:38.565
then that could be something
that a female preference might

00:38:38.565 --> 00:38:40.679
then evolve to notice.
 

00:38:40.679 --> 00:38:44.186
We'll go into that,
but you can see immediately

00:38:44.186 --> 00:38:46.929
that if the signal is not
costly,

00:38:46.929 --> 00:38:49.739
then it can be invaded by
cheaters,

00:38:49.739 --> 00:38:53.300
and then as soon as there was
cheating going on,

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:56.657
the female preference would
erode, because there wouldn't be

00:38:56.657 --> 00:38:58.820
any point to having that
preference;

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:00.650
you were getting cheated on too
frequently.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:01.510
Yes?
 

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:03.601
Student:  I just have a
question about the sexy-son

00:39:03.601 --> 00:39:04.079
hypothesis.
 

00:39:04.079 --> 00:39:04.599
Prof: Yes.
 

00:39:04.599 --> 00:39:09.057
Student:  It seems like
it implies a certain psychology

00:39:09.057 --> 00:39:12.639
in the mother that's kind of
expensive to have.

00:39:12.639 --> 00:39:14.289
Prof: Yes it does,
doesn't it?

00:39:14.289 --> 00:39:18.822
And isn't it interesting that
things that we find beautiful

00:39:18.822 --> 00:39:23.514
evidently are also preferred by
female birds and by bees that

00:39:23.514 --> 00:39:27.110
are locating flowers and things
like that?

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:31.239
It implies a whole set of
innate preferences in choice.

00:39:31.239 --> 00:39:33.719
It doesn't imply necessarily
consciousness;

00:39:33.719 --> 00:39:36.070
I mean, you can build robots
that will do this.

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:42.623
But it does imply a fairly
costly choice apparatus,

00:39:42.623 --> 00:39:46.820
which appears to have evolved.
 

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:50.070
Frequency dependent selection
is another kind of selection,

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:52.800
and that happens whenever the
advantage of doing one thing

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.820
depends on what the other people
in the population are doing.

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.268
Okay?
 

00:39:57.268 --> 00:39:59.599
There are some classical
examples of this.

00:39:59.599 --> 00:40:03.514
One is the classical 50:50 sex
ratio, and another is genetic

00:40:03.514 --> 00:40:05.440
diversity for immune genes.
 

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.592
I'll just say a few words about
genetic diversity for immune

00:40:08.592 --> 00:40:11.800
genes, because we're going to
come back to sex ratios when we

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.349
do sex allocation theory.
 

00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:18.518
Let's suppose that you have a
gene that is resistant to a

00:40:18.518 --> 00:40:22.141
particular disease,
and therefore your offspring

00:40:22.141 --> 00:40:24.929
survive better and you have more
grandchildren,

00:40:24.929 --> 00:40:28.132
and this gene then spreads
through the population until

00:40:28.132 --> 00:40:31.929
eventually most of the people in
the population are resistant.

00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:35.530
That means that there's
selection operating on the

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:39.574
disease to come up with a
variant that can overcome that

00:40:39.574 --> 00:40:42.641
resistance,
and when that variant comes up,

00:40:42.641 --> 00:40:44.840
it will spread until it is
common,

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.019
and it creates selection to
cause the same thing going on in

00:40:48.019 --> 00:40:51.650
the host population,
and back and forth it goes.

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:54.730
The more frequent something
becomes,

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:58.650
the more it's subject to very
strong negative selection,

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:01.230
and the less frequent it
becomes, the more it's protected

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:04.585
from being selected,
because things that are rare

00:41:04.585 --> 00:41:08.197
aren't very good resources;
things that are common are

00:41:08.197 --> 00:41:09.059
great resources.
 

00:41:09.059 --> 00:41:13.320
And so what happens is that you
get what is now recognized as a

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:17.168
classical oscillation of
virulence and resistance between

00:41:17.168 --> 00:41:19.230
the host and the pathogen.
 

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:23.713
One of the most interesting
things about a human immune

00:41:23.713 --> 00:41:28.693
system is that the MHC or HLA
genes that mediate this kind of

00:41:28.693 --> 00:41:33.675
resistance against pathogens
have some of the highest genetic

00:41:33.675 --> 00:41:36.829
diversity of any genes anywhere.
 

00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:39.449
It looks like variants,
rare variants,

00:41:39.449 --> 00:41:42.780
have been selected again and
again and again.

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.119
So every time something becomes
frequent,

00:41:44.119 --> 00:41:46.710
it becomes useless and another
rare one is selected,

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:50.032
and eventually a huge supply of
variation builds up in the

00:41:50.032 --> 00:41:50.789
population.
 

00:41:50.789 --> 00:41:55.985
So this principle really has
had quite a role to play in the

00:41:55.985 --> 00:41:59.860
selection of the vertebrate
immune system.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:04.699
Okay, group selection and
species selection.

00:42:04.699 --> 00:42:07.159
I'll go through this fairly
quickly.

00:42:07.159 --> 00:42:11.711
We're going to come back to
this issue when we do behavior

00:42:11.711 --> 00:42:12.989
in, um, April.
 

00:42:12.989 --> 00:42:14.380
Okay?
 

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:19.320
But group selection--here's an
example of group selection.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:24.460
A bunch of partridges get
together in Scotland in late

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:25.139
fall.
 

00:42:25.139 --> 00:42:26.989
They look around.
 

00:42:26.989 --> 00:42:30.360
They notice that there are just
a tremendous number of

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.840
partridges in Scotland in late
fall,

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:39.550
and they think--you know,
speaking anthropomorphically--

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:41.849
they think, "Oh,
there are too many partridges.

00:42:41.849 --> 00:42:44.728
Therefore we will all cut back
on our reproduction so that our

00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:46.570
population does not go
extinct."

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:50.230
That's an example of group
selection.

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:52.688
It won't work because over in
the corner is sitting Joe

00:42:52.688 --> 00:42:54.965
Partridge, who looks at all of
these guys and says,

00:42:54.965 --> 00:42:56.059
"You're idiots.
 

00:42:56.059 --> 00:42:58.059
You're cutting back on your
reproduction.

00:42:58.059 --> 00:42:59.670
I'm going to have 50
babies."

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:02.800
&gt;
 

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.000
Group selection is vulnerable
to selfish mutations;

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.059
selfish mutants invade.
 

00:43:08.059 --> 00:43:09.150
Okay?
 

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:12.297
So they invade for a variety of
reasons, and we'll work through

00:43:12.297 --> 00:43:13.010
all of that.
 

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:15.469
But group selection is not
stable.

00:43:15.469 --> 00:43:16.750
Selfish mutants invade.
 

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:17.619
They do so.
 

00:43:17.619 --> 00:43:20.463
There's a lot of selective
events in genes and individuals

00:43:20.463 --> 00:43:22.659
for each selective event of a
whole group.

00:43:22.659 --> 00:43:26.719
And if you extend group
selection up to species--

00:43:26.719 --> 00:43:29.179
how many times have you guys
ever heard,

00:43:29.179 --> 00:43:33.090
perhaps on Discovery Channel or
BBC or National Geographic,

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:39.291
that behavior X or morphology Y
exists for the good of the

00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:40.380
species?
 

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.659
Have you ever heard that?
 

00:43:42.659 --> 00:43:44.320
Yes, it happens a lot.
 

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:47.389
It's bullshit,
just plain bullshit.

00:43:47.389 --> 00:43:48.518
Okay?
 

00:43:48.518 --> 00:43:51.719
Things don't exist for the good
of the species.

00:43:51.719 --> 00:43:55.686
Things exist because
individuals outperformed other

00:43:55.686 --> 00:44:00.289
individuals in the competition
for reproductive success.

00:44:00.289 --> 00:44:06.505
Now there is some large-scale
differential species selection

00:44:06.505 --> 00:44:10.719
that occurs on the phylogenetic
tree,

00:44:10.719 --> 00:44:15.449
and it shapes patterns at a big
macro scale across the tree.

00:44:15.449 --> 00:44:16.960
One of them is sex.
 

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:21.983
Virtually all asexual things
are relatively young and they

00:44:21.983 --> 00:44:24.010
had sexual ancestors.
 

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:28.590
It appears that sex reduces the
probability of extinction,

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:32.449
and that asex makes you more
extinction prone.

00:44:32.449 --> 00:44:35.670
So that is a kind of species
selection.

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:39.469
But it's not a selection for a
precise adaptation.

00:44:39.469 --> 00:44:41.719
There's no way that species
selection could have ever

00:44:41.719 --> 00:44:45.041
designed the vertebrate eye,
the vertebrate brain,

00:44:45.041 --> 00:44:48.958
any of the detailed,
precise, complicated mechanisms

00:44:48.958 --> 00:44:50.619
that we know of in biology.
 

00:44:50.619 --> 00:44:54.061
All that stuff has gone on
because of individual and gene

00:44:54.061 --> 00:44:54.800
selection.
 

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:58.023
Some of the big macro
evolutionary patterns have been

00:44:58.023 --> 00:45:00.690
generated by a kind of species
selection.

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:02.934
For example,
the fact that dinosaurs aren't

00:45:02.934 --> 00:45:06.141
here anymore and that mammals
dominate the earth is a kind of

00:45:06.141 --> 00:45:06.889
selection.
 

00:45:06.889 --> 00:45:09.780
It doesn't tell you about how
fast the mammals run,

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:12.500
why they are warm-blooded,
ta-da da-da da-da.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.369
Dinosaurs were warm-blooded too.
 

00:45:15.369 --> 00:45:21.230
Okay, we can classify selection
a number of different ways.

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:26.507
Each one, each of the methods
of classification,

00:45:26.507 --> 00:45:29.539
highlights a distinction.
 

00:45:29.539 --> 00:45:33.081
Selection can be strong and the
response can be fast,

00:45:33.081 --> 00:45:36.010
but some traits evolve very,
very slowly.

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:40.472
And you need to be able to hold
those two facts in your mind,

00:45:40.472 --> 00:45:44.862
and have intellectual tools
that will allow you to deal with

00:45:44.862 --> 00:45:46.349
both situations.
 

00:45:46.349 --> 00:45:52.800
Okay, next time Neutral and
Maladaptive Evolution.

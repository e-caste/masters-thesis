00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.581
Prof: Now today we're
going to be talking about some

00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:08.910
of the major events in the
geological theater.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.424
This is the second of three
ways that we're looking at the

00:00:13.424 --> 00:00:14.850
history of life.
 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.898
The first was rather abstract;
it had to do with major

00:00:18.898 --> 00:00:22.164
transitions and with
reorganization of genetic

00:00:22.164 --> 00:00:26.010
information, units of selection,
things like that.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.170
That was last time.
 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.331
Today we're going to talk about
how life shaped the planet and

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.310
how the planet shaped life.
 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:42.130
So this is a quick run through
a 4.5 billion year process.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.016
And then next time we're going
to talk about major lessons from

00:00:46.016 --> 00:00:47.270
the fossil record.
 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.654
There are a lot of ways of
trying to construct a diagram

00:00:52.654 --> 00:00:58.920
that will give you a feel for
deep time, and it's not so easy.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.853
I once did a kindergarten class
where I took a bunch of

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:05.168
kindergartners and I tried to
get them to step off 100 million

00:01:05.168 --> 00:01:07.780
years at a time,
or 10 million years at a time.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.802
I think I did 10 million years
so that we could take six steps

00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:12.140
and then meet a dinosaur.
 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.549
And there are a lot of ways of
doing this,

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.400
but this is not a bad one
because it gives you a diagram

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.956
that shows you about how much of
the existence of the planet has

00:01:26.956 --> 00:01:32.327
been occupied by life;
about how much of it has been a

00:01:32.327 --> 00:01:36.000
story that's mostly of
prokaryotes,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.962
in other words about half of
the time that life has been on

00:01:39.962 --> 00:01:42.004
the planet,
there have only been

00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:45.629
prokaryotes;
and about how much of it has

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:50.010
been complicated multicellular
organisms.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.854
And, of course,
we show up just briefly before

00:01:52.854 --> 00:01:55.129
midnight, on that kind of a
scale.

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:57.040
So that's one way of looking at
it.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.203
And learning to think about
deep time is really important if

00:02:03.203 --> 00:02:07.280
you have a taste for
macroevolution,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.090
and it's certainly important if
you have a taste for geology.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:20.294
Now, at the beginning,
we had a reducing atmosphere,

00:02:20.294 --> 00:02:29.500
and the source of O2 was
photosynthetic bacteria.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.789
I'm just going to check
something here;

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:34.650
yes, okay.
 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.470
So we start off with a reducing
atmosphere,

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.500
and then we have to fill up
essentially,

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.440
once the photosynthetic
bacteria get going--

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.247
and, by the way,
some of them were

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:03.990
chemosynthetic as well as
photosynthetic--

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.252
once the photosynthetic
bacteria get going and start

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:09.887
producing a lot of oxygen,
there's a tremendous mass of

00:03:09.887 --> 00:03:15.086
stuff on the face of the earth
that has to be oxygenated before

00:03:15.086 --> 00:03:17.349
there's any free oxygen.
 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.340
So that takes quite awhile.
 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.092
So until about half of the age
of the planet,

00:03:24.092 --> 00:03:29.042
the concentration of oxygen in
the atmosphere was less than

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:29.810
0.4%.
 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.262
You would all die within a
minute, at that oxygen

00:03:35.262 --> 00:03:37.080
concentration.
 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.276
And the evidence that we have
of when there was free oxygen in

00:03:41.276 --> 00:03:45.472
the atmosphere is essentially
the age of the iron mines of the

00:03:45.472 --> 00:03:46.160
world.
 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.878
So there was ferrous oxide--it
can dissolve in water--

00:03:52.878 --> 00:03:55.654
floating around in the ocean,
and when the oxygen level of

00:03:55.654 --> 00:03:59.230
the atmosphere got high enough,
it oxidized to ferric oxide,

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.250
and the ferric oxide fell out
of solution,

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.609
and when it fell out of
solution it made the iron mines

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:07.818
of the world.
 

00:04:07.818 --> 00:04:11.038
That happened 2.3 billion years
ago.

00:04:11.038 --> 00:04:15.908
This kind of process continued
with other sorts of elements.

00:04:15.908 --> 00:04:19.646
So we have copper coming out at
about 1.7 billion years,

00:04:19.646 --> 00:04:22.230
at a higher concentration of
oxygen.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.690
And the consequences of free
oxygen are that an ozone layer

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.139
forms in the atmosphere.
 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:35.567
That screens ultraviolet light
and that drops the mutation

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:38.310
rate,
and it's probably only because

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.745
the mutation rate dropped
significantly with an ozone

00:04:41.745 --> 00:04:45.509
layer that we could evolve large
long-lived organisms.

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.377
Once you have oxygen in the
atmosphere, you can start

00:04:49.377 --> 00:04:50.790
getting nitrates.
 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.889
Nitrates are oxygenated
nitrogen.

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.369
So you won't really have
nitrogen fertilizer until you

00:04:57.369 --> 00:05:00.519
have free oxygen,
and that then also became a key

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:02.028
nutrient for algae.
 

00:05:02.028 --> 00:05:06.519
So there's a whole sequence of
important chemistry that goes on

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:11.081
over a period of about 3 billion
years that starts to set up the

00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:14.050
environment that we're familiar
with.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.569
There are a number of ways of
looking at this.

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:18.680
This is from Don Desmirais,
at the Ames Research Center.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.411
He's an astrobiologist and has
specialized in trying to examine

00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:24.819
the question of life on other
planets;

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:28.254
and they have tried to make
diagrams like this for other

00:05:28.254 --> 00:05:29.379
planets as well.
 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:35.230
So in our early environment,
the sun was only about 70% as

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.952
hot as it is now,
and by about 500 million year

00:05:39.952 --> 00:05:42.519
ago it was up to 95%.
 

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:46.502
The early environment of the
earth was a meteorite

00:05:46.502 --> 00:05:47.639
bombardment.
 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.000
So if you were out looking at
the night sky--

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.915
which, of course,
you wouldn't have been able to

00:05:52.915 --> 00:05:55.156
do because the meteorite
bombardment was so intense that

00:05:55.156 --> 00:05:57.519
you would've been standing on a
boiling lake of lava--

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:59.600
but, if you were out,
looking at the night sky,

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.151
on your boiling lake in lava,
in your terminator suit or

00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:06.451
whatever,
you would've seen lots and lots

00:06:06.451 --> 00:06:11.399
of big meteorites coming in
every night;

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:14.269
and that gradually tailed off.
 

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:15.290
Okay?
 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:20.031
The heat flow out of the molten
mass forming the core of the

00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:23.649
earth has tended to drop off and
stabilize.

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:26.754
So it has a continuous
radioactive input,

00:06:26.754 --> 00:06:31.413
but the original heat from the
entire planet being molten has

00:06:31.413 --> 00:06:33.199
gradually radiated.
 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:36.298
So we're stabilizing at about
the heat flow from the

00:06:36.298 --> 00:06:38.060
radioactivity in the earth.
 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:45.148
And the continents formed and
stabilized at about 1.8 to 2

00:06:45.148 --> 00:06:50.139
billion years ago,
and these things called major

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:54.901
orogenies are major chunks of
continent coming up and major

00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:57.610
mountain ranges getting built.
 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.213
Now the collision of plate
tectonics has continued to form

00:07:01.213 --> 00:07:04.966
mountain ranges since then,
but this just stabilizing the

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:07.910
continental crust took about 2
billion years.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.100
If you look at the history of
the atmosphere,

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.795
of course we're currently
worried about the costs:

00:07:16.795 --> 00:07:19.654
carbon taxes,
and global warming,

00:07:19.654 --> 00:07:23.562
and anthropogenic effects on
the CO2 concentration in the

00:07:23.562 --> 00:07:24.540
atmosphere.
 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.810
But at the origin,
the CO2 level was much,

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.610
much higher.
 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.264
The atmosphere was more than
what we would call 100% CO2,

00:07:35.264 --> 00:07:38.920
because it was thicker at that
point, and it blew off.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:44.420
This has dropped down here to
about 3 times 10^(-4)

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.829
atmospheric pressure for CO2.
 

00:07:47.829 --> 00:07:49.819
It's actually a small component.
 

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:56.053
Oxygen rose and probably
reached present levels at about

00:07:56.053 --> 00:07:59.339
5 or 600 million years ago.
 

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:03.384
It's interesting that if it
went up a little bit more,

00:08:03.384 --> 00:08:07.889
a room like this could catch on
fire, just spontaneously.

00:08:07.889 --> 00:08:10.879
At about 27%,
wood will catch on fire

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:13.786
spontaneously,
at current atmosphere

00:08:13.786 --> 00:08:14.949
pressures.
 

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.069
So this is another way of
looking at that process.

00:08:21.069 --> 00:08:23.358
At the beginning,
we had water,

00:08:23.358 --> 00:08:26.639
hydrogen, carbon monoxide,
lots of steam;

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:30.720
a lot of that escaped to space.
 

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.399
There were meteorite impacts.
 

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:34.179
The CO2 curve has gone down.
 

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:37.784
The oxygen curve has done up;
there's some indications it's

00:08:37.784 --> 00:08:38.590
gone up stepwise.
 

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.875
Temperature,
we don't really know accurately

00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:46.308
what the temperature was back
before 3.5 billion years,

00:08:46.308 --> 00:08:51.538
but we can be pretty sure that
at and after the origin of life,

00:08:51.538 --> 00:08:54.879
water was liquid on the surface
of the planet;

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:58.269
so that sets an upper limit of
100 degrees Centigrade.

00:08:58.269 --> 00:09:03.327
And temperature has gone up and
down in a number of cycles over

00:09:03.327 --> 00:09:07.489
a fairly long period,
and there have been some major

00:09:07.489 --> 00:09:08.549
Ice Ages.
 

00:09:08.549 --> 00:09:11.168
How do you recover that?
 

00:09:11.168 --> 00:09:16.220
Well one of the ways that you
can do it is you can look,

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.558
if you have leaves of fossil
plants--

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:21.452
so if you've already got plants
that evolved and they have

00:09:21.452 --> 00:09:24.456
leaves;
so maybe about the last 300

00:09:24.456 --> 00:09:29.924
million years or so--you can
look at the stomatal ratios on

00:09:29.924 --> 00:09:30.679
them.
 

00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:33.480
So this has been calibrated.
 

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.288
Plants have to make more holes
in their leaves;

00:09:36.288 --> 00:09:38.791
if there's less carbon,
they have to have a bigger

00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:41.190
mouth so that they can feed more
efficiently.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.729
And they can have fewer holes
in their leaves if--and they can

00:09:44.729 --> 00:09:47.918
be smaller--if there's more
carbon in the atmosphere.

00:09:47.918 --> 00:09:52.692
And so basically this allows
you to plot and estimate a

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:53.399
curve.
 

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:56.791
And it looks like there was
massive withdrawal of carbon

00:09:56.791 --> 00:09:59.690
dioxide from the atmosphere from
the Ordovician,

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.908
through the Permian,
right here.

00:10:01.908 --> 00:10:04.740
And then there was a
re-injection here,

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.511
going into the Triassic--and
when we come to the Permian Mass

00:10:07.511 --> 00:10:10.248
Extinction,
I want you to remember this dip

00:10:10.248 --> 00:10:12.326
here,
and this re-injection--and then

00:10:12.326 --> 00:10:15.283
there's been a more gradual
withdrawal down to the current

00:10:15.283 --> 00:10:15.750
level.
 

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:24.561
So the earth was much more of a
greenhouse in the past than it

00:10:24.561 --> 00:10:26.149
is today.
 

00:10:26.149 --> 00:10:29.336
And if we look at where the
carbon dioxide went,

00:10:29.336 --> 00:10:33.538
a lot of it got locked up in
limestone, in sedimentary rock.

00:10:33.538 --> 00:10:36.570
Then a lot of it is in organic
carbon.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.240
A lot of it is in the ocean,
is bicarbonate.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.283
These are by far the largest
sinks, but there's a lot of

00:10:43.283 --> 00:10:45.000
bicarbonate ion in the ocean.
 

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.389
This is all the fossil fuel on
the planet right here;

00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:50.408
so this is all the coal and oil.
 

00:10:50.408 --> 00:10:53.952
And you can see that of the
original amount of carbon that

00:10:53.952 --> 00:10:57.928
was in the earth's atmosphere,
that's a pretty small fraction;

00:10:57.928 --> 00:11:05.200
it's a bit less than
1/1000^(th) of 1%.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.004
And in living biomass,
there's a very,

00:11:08.004 --> 00:11:09.370
very small part.
 

00:11:12.528 --> 00:11:17.288
So basically if you look at
that, you can see that the

00:11:17.288 --> 00:11:22.673
carbon balance of the planet is
extremely dependent upon what

00:11:22.673 --> 00:11:27.270
happens in rocks,
and that if there are small

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:33.096
geological changes in the cycle
of how carbon is going in and

00:11:33.096 --> 00:11:35.883
out of rock,
and whether it's being

00:11:35.883 --> 00:11:38.519
subducted as plate tectonics
proceeds or not,

00:11:38.519 --> 00:11:42.166
is going to make a much bigger
difference to the amount of

00:11:42.166 --> 00:11:46.067
carbon in the atmosphere than
the amount of fossil fuel that's

00:11:46.067 --> 00:11:51.615
being burned,
or the tree cover of the planet

00:11:51.615 --> 00:11:54.975
in forests,
which would be the living

00:11:54.975 --> 00:11:56.428
biomass term down here.
 

00:11:56.428 --> 00:12:00.821
However, this is a slow
process, and this is a fast

00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:01.700
process.
 

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.434
So on the scale of human
lifespans, this is in fact more

00:12:05.434 --> 00:12:06.250
important.
 

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:10.725
But on the scale of say
somewhere out at around 100,000,

00:12:10.725 --> 00:12:15.770
out into the millions of years,
what's happening in sedimentary

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.048
rock is really critical.
 

00:12:18.048 --> 00:12:23.618
Now if we look at the way that
life structures the planet,

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:28.794
one of the very important
things that life has done is

00:12:28.794 --> 00:12:31.139
that it's made soil.
 

00:12:31.139 --> 00:12:34.240
And we don't really start to
get soil,

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:40.494
which is a big complicated
piece, an engineered niche that

00:12:40.494 --> 00:12:45.063
plants create,
until we get complicated plants

00:12:45.063 --> 00:12:45.850
on land.
 

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:49.340
So the first ones on land are
probably things like liverworts,

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.950
and our first fossils are club
mosses,

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:56.552
and that's happening back at
around 400 to 500 million years

00:12:56.552 --> 00:12:57.019
ago.
 

00:12:57.019 --> 00:13:01.347
There are fossil soils,
and those fossil soils have

00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:04.946
roots in them,
and those roots suggest that

00:13:04.946 --> 00:13:09.500
the first time that there were
real trees was at about 350 to

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.399
400 million years ago.
 

00:13:11.399 --> 00:13:12.970
Remember back to that clock.
 

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.320
This is relatively recent,
in terms of the age of the

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:16.899
planet.
 

00:13:16.899 --> 00:13:21.568
So we get really modern soils
with layering,

00:13:21.568 --> 00:13:27.649
and with evidence of seed
plants in the Carboniferous.

00:13:27.649 --> 00:13:31.307
So that is the age at which
most of the coal mines of the

00:13:31.307 --> 00:13:34.226
earth were laid down;
it's about 300 million years

00:13:34.226 --> 00:13:34.480
ago.
 

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.190
If you take Interstate 80,
west of New York,

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.908
and you go out to where it
crosses from New Jersey into

00:13:41.908 --> 00:13:44.873
Pennsylvania,
at the Delaware Water Gap,

00:13:44.873 --> 00:13:48.168
there's a cut there that you
can look up at,

00:13:48.168 --> 00:13:51.831
and what you're looking at is
the outwash of rivers that were

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:54.759
coming down off of the Taconic
mountain range.

00:13:54.759 --> 00:14:02.850
And if you look into that cut,
it's remarkably clean.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:08.121
It's a preservation of what was
coming down rivers 500 million

00:14:08.121 --> 00:14:12.616
years ago, and it's an
indication that there was very

00:14:12.616 --> 00:14:14.000
little soil.
 

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.038
It is basically at or before
this process occurs.

00:14:19.038 --> 00:14:23.200
And that mountain range was
formed when Pangaea formed,

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:28.740
which is at around 550 to 600
million years ago,

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.077
and caused the Taconic orogeny,
and that put up a mountain

00:14:32.077 --> 00:14:35.356
range on the border between
Connecticut and New York that

00:14:35.356 --> 00:14:37.700
was about as high as the
Himalayas,

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.850
but it didn't have any forests
on it,

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.100
and it had a very high erosion
rate because there weren't

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.899
plants to stabilize the soil.
 

00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:47.541
And we can see,
in the Delaware Water Gap,

00:14:47.541 --> 00:14:49.990
what washed off that mountain
range.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.549
It's all worn down now,
and if we come back in another

00:14:53.549 --> 00:14:56.774
500 million years,
the Himalayas will all be worn

00:14:56.774 --> 00:14:57.379
down.
 

00:14:57.379 --> 00:15:01.073
But, with the Himalayas,
there will be a bit more soil

00:15:01.073 --> 00:15:02.259
in the outwash.
 

00:15:07.259 --> 00:15:12.080
The guys that have really in
the past engineered the planet,

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.918
and that continue to do so,
are the bacteria;

00:15:15.918 --> 00:15:19.509
and by that I mean both the
archaea and the eubacteria.

00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:25.590
They are the ones that play a
huge role in the carbon cycle.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.710
They're producing and
oxygenating methane.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.600
They're fixing carbon dioxide.
 

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.731
In the nitrogen cycle,
the bacteria are fixing

00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:36.288
nitrogen from the atmosphere;
they fix it as ammonia.

00:15:36.288 --> 00:15:37.970
They oxygenate ammonia to
nitrate;

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.090
they de-nitrify nitrates to
ammonia.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:43.234
And this is a kind of
biochemistry that just about

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:44.389
nobody else has.
 

00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:48.789
So these are essential things;
the nitrogen in all of the

00:15:48.789 --> 00:15:52.539
proteins on the planet is
essentially originating through

00:15:52.539 --> 00:15:54.080
bacterial processes.
 

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.629
So that's how it's getting from
the abiotic world into the

00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:57.299
living world.
 

00:16:01.278 --> 00:16:06.759
There are sulfur bacteria that
are arguably extremely ancient,

00:16:06.759 --> 00:16:10.133
and which evolved in an
environment in which much of the

00:16:10.133 --> 00:16:13.506
energy coming into living
systems was coming from things

00:16:13.506 --> 00:16:16.037
like sulfur,
rather than from sunlight,

00:16:16.037 --> 00:16:18.668
and they oxidize hydrogen
sulfide to sulfate;

00:16:18.668 --> 00:16:20.820
they reduce sulfate to hydrogen
sulfide.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.426
And iron bacteria are
converting ferrous to ferric

00:16:24.426 --> 00:16:28.768
iron, and they're influencing a
degradation of manganese and

00:16:28.768 --> 00:16:30.240
copper deposits.
 

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.269
A lot of this is now going on
at spreading centers at

00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:37.801
mid-ocean ridges,
or it is going on where there

00:16:37.801 --> 00:16:41.696
is heat flow which is taking
ocean water through the ocean

00:16:41.696 --> 00:16:44.124
crust,
and there are bacteria that are

00:16:44.124 --> 00:16:47.217
sitting just below the ocean
crust that are sitting in a

00:16:47.217 --> 00:16:50.820
stream of basically hot chemical
soup that's coming through,

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.333
and when they do these
reactions, often they leave a

00:16:54.333 --> 00:16:57.636
metal deposit behind;
which is why the floor of the

00:16:57.636 --> 00:17:01.071
Pacific Ocean is covered with
manganese nodules that people

00:17:01.071 --> 00:17:04.920
are thinking about mining at a
depth of about five kilometers.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.890
If you go down into the earth's
crust, it turns out that the

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:14.440
biosphere extends below our feet
several kilometers;

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.269
bacteria are active that far
down into the soil,

00:17:17.269 --> 00:17:19.980
and they are carrying out
things like this.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:25.318
So they are really key players
in structuring the environment

00:17:25.318 --> 00:17:29.090
in which we live,
and they do a lot of services

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:33.347
that we simply take for granted
and frankly hadn't even noticed

00:17:33.347 --> 00:17:36.368
until about the last hundred
years of so.

00:17:36.368 --> 00:17:41.988
Okay, so those are all aspects
of how life has modified the

00:17:41.988 --> 00:17:42.858
planet.
 

00:17:42.858 --> 00:17:46.588
How has the planet modified
life?

00:17:46.588 --> 00:17:50.720
Well there are at least three
or four big chapters here.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.069
One is through continental
drift;

00:17:52.069 --> 00:17:54.470
another is glaciation;
mass extinction;

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:55.838
and then local catastrophes.
 

00:17:55.838 --> 00:17:59.750
And continental drift and mass
extinctions are both out there

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.880
at the scale of hundreds of
millions of years.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.009
Glaciation has two scales.
 

00:18:07.009 --> 00:18:09.800
There are times in the planet's
history when it's been

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.553
relatively cold;
basically there've been at

00:18:12.553 --> 00:18:16.160
least three times when it's been
really quite cold.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.555
But within those longer periods
that are cold,

00:18:18.555 --> 00:18:20.950
the glaciers have come and gone
many times.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:24.153
So the North American
glaciation lasted 2.5 million

00:18:24.153 --> 00:18:27.483
years, and the glaciers came and
went about 15 times,

00:18:27.483 --> 00:18:28.828
in North America.
 

00:18:28.828 --> 00:18:33.569
The local catastrophes,
it all depends on which

00:18:33.569 --> 00:18:36.250
particular kind that is.
 

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.470
You'll see that they occur at
different time scales.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:43.237
The point of all of this is
that often the past

00:18:43.237 --> 00:18:48.676
configuration of the planet,
whether it's the location of

00:18:48.676 --> 00:18:52.481
the continents,
or the temperature of the

00:18:52.481 --> 00:18:57.680
earth, or whether you could
expect to live in a secure

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.430
environment,
have at times been extremely

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.390
different from what we currently
see.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:07.201
And so it is not only
important, if you want to

00:19:07.201 --> 00:19:10.487
understand evolution,
to cultivate a sense of deep

00:19:10.487 --> 00:19:14.250
time, it's also important to
cultivate a sense of different

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.491
time;
sometimes deep time was really

00:19:16.491 --> 00:19:19.190
different, and that's what I'm
trying to get at,

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.970
by showing you these things.
 

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:25.558
So here's the last 400 million
years of continental drift.

00:19:25.558 --> 00:19:28.352
And, by the way,
people are producing models

00:19:28.352 --> 00:19:32.118
that can now take this back to
about oh a billion years.

00:19:32.118 --> 00:19:34.519
Of course, the further you go
back,

00:19:34.519 --> 00:19:36.269
the harder it is to reconstruct
it,

00:19:36.269 --> 00:19:38.950
because the continents have
come together and come apart,

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.948
and come together and come
apart, in a long-term cycle

00:19:41.948 --> 00:19:44.673
several times,
and in so doing they kind of

00:19:44.673 --> 00:19:47.068
wipe out the traces of their
history.

00:19:47.068 --> 00:19:50.298
So it's really quite a feat to
try to reconstruct it.

00:19:50.298 --> 00:19:52.539
And I'd just like to point out
a couple of things here.

00:19:52.539 --> 00:19:53.990
This is Gondwana.
 

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:56.788
So Pangaea was a little bit
earlier than this;

00:19:56.788 --> 00:19:59.240
that was when all of the
continents were together.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.450
South America and Africa and
Antarctica and Australia stuck

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.788
together--and India--stuck
together for awhile,

00:20:06.788 --> 00:20:08.750
before they came apart.
 

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.680
There is an interesting thing
going on right here.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.608
Here's New Haven.
 

00:20:13.608 --> 00:20:16.288
If you go out to Lighthouse
Park in New Haven,

00:20:16.288 --> 00:20:19.753
you'll see some rocks there,
and if you trace where the

00:20:19.753 --> 00:20:22.318
closest relatives of those rocks
are,

00:20:22.318 --> 00:20:26.109
on the other side of the ocean,
they're in Rabat,

00:20:26.109 --> 00:20:26.900
Morocco.
 

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.650
Okay?
 

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:31.040
So you can actually see the
same kind of rock on the other

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:31.880
side of the ocean.
 

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.328
And that's when that happened;
that's 250 million years old.

00:20:35.328 --> 00:20:37.670
Anybody know how old East Rock
is?

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.460
East Rock's 225 million years
old.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.032
When the Atlantic opened--you
see the Atlantic opening

00:20:46.032 --> 00:20:48.413
here--there were a series of
rifts that opened up,

00:20:48.413 --> 00:20:50.210
one of which became the
Atlantic;

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:54.380
another one became the
Connecticut River Valley.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.588
It didn't open,
but it went part way,

00:20:56.588 --> 00:20:59.407
and then it had a valley
filling lava flow that filled it

00:20:59.407 --> 00:21:02.099
up,
and then the flow tipped,

00:21:02.099 --> 00:21:07.174
and it tipped pointing west,
and it cracked in a number of

00:21:07.174 --> 00:21:09.125
places,
and that's what's East Rock,

00:21:09.125 --> 00:21:10.987
West Rock,
and all the other such

00:21:10.987 --> 00:21:14.162
formations that go up through
central Massachusetts to

00:21:14.162 --> 00:21:15.359
southern Vermont.
 

00:21:15.359 --> 00:21:19.640
That was a big lava flow;
filled up a big rift valley.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.700
So that happened right here.
 

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:30.795
Now when Gondwana split up,
it had some things living on

00:21:30.795 --> 00:21:31.440
it.
 

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:35.055
The ratite birds,
and they are flightless and

00:21:35.055 --> 00:21:38.916
they don't swim,
and essentially they got rafted

00:21:38.916 --> 00:21:41.298
around on pieces of rock.
 

00:21:41.298 --> 00:21:44.730
And it's interesting,
if you think about when

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:48.328
Gondwana split up,
it indicates that the ancestor

00:21:48.328 --> 00:21:52.444
of these birds was already alive
and living across that range of

00:21:52.444 --> 00:21:55.480
geography,
at that point.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:00.243
And you can lay a molecular
phylogeny of the ratites onto

00:22:00.243 --> 00:22:05.009
these continents and it just
ties them right together.

00:22:05.009 --> 00:22:06.578
Okay?
 

00:22:06.578 --> 00:22:11.455
There's another thing that
happened with the breakup of

00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:12.358
Pangaea.
 

00:22:12.358 --> 00:22:14.970
Laurasia went north,
Gondwana went south.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.905
In between, for awhile,
there was a thing called the

00:22:18.905 --> 00:22:19.910
Tethys Sea.
 

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:22.794
And this is the configuration
of the continents about 50

00:22:22.794 --> 00:22:24.630
million years ago,
in the Eocene.

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:26.170
By the way, the Eocene was
quite warm;

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.930
it was really a very tropical
period.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.798
And at that time there was
either--

00:22:32.798 --> 00:22:37.304
there was a warm kind of
Mediterranean coastline that

00:22:37.304 --> 00:22:40.769
stretched from eastern North
America,

00:22:40.769 --> 00:22:43.146
through Nepal,
what is now Nepal,

00:22:43.146 --> 00:22:45.598
into what is now eastern China.
 

00:22:45.598 --> 00:22:50.113
This was before India rafted
north and Africa came north and

00:22:50.113 --> 00:22:51.950
closed off South Asia.
 

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:56.654
And this is what is thought to
have accounted for some of the

00:22:56.654 --> 00:23:01.201
similarities in the plants that
you find in the Appalachian

00:23:01.201 --> 00:23:03.318
Mountains and in China.
 

00:23:03.318 --> 00:23:05.500
And there are many affinities
here.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:10.491
The rhododendrons, viburnum;
there are a number of tree

00:23:10.491 --> 00:23:15.636
species that share a
phylogenetic relationship across

00:23:15.636 --> 00:23:21.078
that huge geographical distance,
and it's thought to have been

00:23:21.078 --> 00:23:24.837
the signature of a corridor
along which seeds could move 50

00:23:24.837 --> 00:23:26.200
million years ago.
 

00:23:29.279 --> 00:23:31.170
Now how about glaciers?
 

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:35.730
Well here is a fairly deep
timescale.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.731
So this is the Phanerozoic;
the Phanerozoic is the term for

00:23:38.731 --> 00:23:41.630
everything that's happened since
the Cambrian started.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.058
So this is the Phanerozoic here.
 

00:23:44.058 --> 00:23:46.200
So this is at about 500 million
years.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.118
This is about 600 million
years, and there's evidence for

00:23:50.118 --> 00:23:53.480
one which is deeper,
at about a billion years.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.740
So this is an Ice Age,
this is an Ice Age.

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.328
It looks there was an
Ordovician Ice Age,

00:23:58.328 --> 00:24:00.983
it looks like there was a
Permian Ice Age,

00:24:00.983 --> 00:24:04.740
and then there was an Ice Age
just in the Pleistocene.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:09.950
So about five Ice Ages.
 

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:12.936
Interestingly,
this one, which came before the

00:24:12.936 --> 00:24:16.587
Cambrian, may have been a time
when the earth was almost

00:24:16.587 --> 00:24:18.578
entirely covered with ice.
 

00:24:18.578 --> 00:24:22.684
There are signatures you can
find in the rocks of what

00:24:22.684 --> 00:24:25.304
latitude you're at,
whether you're close to the

00:24:25.304 --> 00:24:27.817
equator or not,
and there are other signatures

00:24:27.817 --> 00:24:31.500
you can find in the rocks that
give you how cold it was.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.952
These are usually in the form
of isotope ratios for things

00:24:34.952 --> 00:24:37.680
like oxygen and carbon and stuff
like that.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.680
And at this point the entire
earth may have been a snowball,

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.380
and only the things that were
very,

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.558
very close to the equator may
have come through,

00:24:48.558 --> 00:24:51.368
because if it really was a
snowball,

00:24:51.368 --> 00:24:56.450
then there was ice covering the
world's oceans.

00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:00.057
That is an interesting issue,
and it's one that will probably

00:25:00.057 --> 00:25:03.305
cause people to speculate and
publish for quite awhile,

00:25:03.305 --> 00:25:05.470
because it's so hard to
resolve;

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:08.259
there's not too much data,
it's a long time ago.

00:25:08.259 --> 00:25:12.686
The Permian glaciation,
however, is much better

00:25:12.686 --> 00:25:13.650
studied.
 

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:18.098
Remember that in the Permian,
Gondwana is still together.

00:25:18.098 --> 00:25:21.589
It breaks up at about 225
million years ago;

00:25:21.589 --> 00:25:24.339
somewhere between 225 and 250.
 

00:25:24.339 --> 00:25:31.009
Well the Permian is at 250;
about 251 I think.

00:25:31.009 --> 00:25:35.305
And there was a southern ice
cap that was on- actually

00:25:35.305 --> 00:25:40.250
connected, and actually these
continents were all together;

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.096
and you can see from the arrows
the direction in which the ice

00:25:43.096 --> 00:25:43.750
was flowing.
 

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:47.865
And I think it's really cool
that you can find rocks,

00:25:47.865 --> 00:25:51.030
from Africa,
that were scraped off by the

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:53.960
glaciers and deposited in
Brazil.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:57.358
Before plate tectonics came
along, nobody had any idea how

00:25:57.358 --> 00:25:58.970
that could have happened.
 

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:01.640
And if you stand on the top of
Table Mountain,

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.489
in Cape Town today--which is
something I recommend that any

00:26:04.489 --> 00:26:07.288
of you that have the opportunity
to go to Cape Town do;

00:26:07.288 --> 00:26:10.125
it's really a very beautiful
place--you can still see the

00:26:10.125 --> 00:26:13.064
grooves in the rock from where
the glaciers moved over Cape

00:26:13.064 --> 00:26:16.210
Town;
they're 250 million years old.

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:25.078
The climate since then has
actually mostly been warm.

00:26:25.078 --> 00:26:29.467
So this, if you look on this
set of maps--this is 50 million

00:26:29.467 --> 00:26:31.930
years ago;
35 million years ago;

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:35.163
15 million years ago;
middle of the Pleistocene,

00:26:35.163 --> 00:26:39.321
about 1.5 million years ago;
and very close to today,

00:26:39.321 --> 00:26:43.838
mid-Holocene would be say about
5000 years ago--

00:26:43.838 --> 00:26:47.374
and you look at how much of the
planet is temperate and

00:26:47.374 --> 00:26:51.681
tropical,
look at how tropical the Eocene

00:26:51.681 --> 00:26:52.250
was.
 

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:55.480
That was all tropical
rainforest, and the Oligocene

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.647
was still- there was still a
huge area of tropics,

00:26:58.647 --> 00:27:01.880
and the Miocene still had
pretty good tropics.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.181
But at the last glacial
maximums, the tropical

00:27:05.181 --> 00:27:08.410
rainforests were reduced to a
few patches.

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:15.064
We're living today in a
relatively cold,

00:27:15.064 --> 00:27:16.890
relatively dry world.
 

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:18.490
That's what we think is normal.
 

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:27.884
If we were to come in a polar
orbiting satellite and look down

00:27:27.884 --> 00:27:31.400
at the planet say 20,000 years
ago,

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:35.363
30,000 years ago,
we would've seen that where

00:27:35.363 --> 00:27:40.587
we're sitting right here is
under probably about a mile and

00:27:40.587 --> 00:27:42.210
a half of ice.
 

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:46.084
The leading edge of it is
pushing stuff off of the

00:27:46.084 --> 00:27:50.353
continent that becomes Long
Island and Block Island and

00:27:50.353 --> 00:27:54.747
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket;
that's the terminal moraine of

00:27:54.747 --> 00:27:55.470
this glacier.
 

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:05.383
Scandinavia and Northern
England are completely under

00:28:05.383 --> 00:28:08.329
ice, as is the North Sea.
 

00:28:08.329 --> 00:28:10.460
The Sahara Desert was humid.
 

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.785
You can go into the middle of
the Sahara Desert and you can

00:28:12.785 --> 00:28:14.588
see rock paintings that humans
made there,

00:28:14.588 --> 00:28:17.804
where they're recording
hippopotamuses and things like

00:28:17.804 --> 00:28:19.301
that,
living in the middle of the

00:28:19.301 --> 00:28:24.019
Sahara,
at this time.

00:28:24.019 --> 00:28:28.017
And we'll see in a minute that
the major tropical forests

00:28:28.017 --> 00:28:28.660
shrank.
 

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:32.019
So this is more or less the
global pattern.

00:28:32.019 --> 00:28:34.440
The grey now is ice.
 

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.318
The green is tropical forest.
 

00:28:37.318 --> 00:28:46.220
The red and orange are--excuse
me, the green is grassland;

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:50.798
the orange is rainforest.
 

00:28:50.798 --> 00:28:55.088
So there are tropical forest
refugia, in certain places.

00:28:55.088 --> 00:29:00.400
And if you were to go into the
south,

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.945
what is now the South China
Sea, which is currently covered

00:29:03.945 --> 00:29:06.932
by water,
elephants and tigers could walk

00:29:06.932 --> 00:29:09.536
out,
over that, because it was dry

00:29:09.536 --> 00:29:11.263
land--
enough water had been tied up

00:29:11.263 --> 00:29:13.338
in the ice to drop the sea level
down that much--

00:29:13.338 --> 00:29:15.900
and that is how they got to
Borneo.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:22.577
So they could actually just
move down from Asia and get out

00:29:22.577 --> 00:29:26.650
as far as Borneo,
but they couldn't make it

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:29.826
across Wallace's Line--
there is a deep-water passage

00:29:29.826 --> 00:29:32.983
there that Alfred Russel Wallace
documented in the biogeography

00:29:32.983 --> 00:29:35.539
of Indonesia--
and they couldn't make it to

00:29:35.539 --> 00:29:37.048
Australia or New Guinea.
 

00:29:37.048 --> 00:29:40.973
So the sea level has gone up
and down, and that's changed

00:29:40.973 --> 00:29:45.108
continental margins and the
ability of things to move around

00:29:45.108 --> 00:29:45.950
in them.
 

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:48.569
So that's impact of glaciations.
 

00:29:48.569 --> 00:29:52.019
What about mass extinctions?
 

00:29:52.019 --> 00:29:57.338
There've been two biggies,
end-Permian and end-Cretaceous.

00:29:57.338 --> 00:30:04.050
And at the end of the Permian
not only did the trilobites

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:07.644
disappear,
but in fact the estimate is

00:30:07.644 --> 00:30:11.713
that 97% of all marine
invertebrate species disappeared

00:30:11.713 --> 00:30:13.900
at the end of the Permian.
 

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:18.307
That is an extremely close
brush with sterilizing the

00:30:18.307 --> 00:30:22.058
planet;
it came pretty close.

00:30:22.058 --> 00:30:26.058
At the end of the Cretaceous
the things that disappeared,

00:30:26.058 --> 00:30:30.500
that we probably would like to
have around to look at,

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.260
if we possibly
could--ammonites,

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.087
dinosaurs--
almost everything that lived on

00:30:35.087 --> 00:30:37.261
land,
that was bigger than five

00:30:37.261 --> 00:30:40.156
kilos, went extinct,
and about 70% of the marine

00:30:40.156 --> 00:30:41.970
invertebrate species went
extinct.

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:44.474
So this was a big one,
but the biggest was the Permian

00:30:44.474 --> 00:30:45.089
extinction.
 

00:30:45.089 --> 00:30:47.750
So these are the trilobites.
 

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:52.529
They had been around since the
late-Cambrian--

00:30:52.529 --> 00:30:55.383
mid-Cambrian to
late-Cambrian--so they had been

00:30:55.383 --> 00:30:57.740
around for about 250 million
years,

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:02.009
and they went extinct at the
end of the Permian.

00:31:02.009 --> 00:31:04.460
And these are ammonites.
 

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:09.830
In fact, the chambered nautilus
is fairly close to being an

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:12.617
ammonite;
it would be sort of a modern

00:31:12.617 --> 00:31:14.259
survivor of this lineage.
 

00:31:14.259 --> 00:31:18.133
So they were squid-like
creatures that had curved

00:31:18.133 --> 00:31:18.858
shells.
 

00:31:18.858 --> 00:31:24.243
And if we look at the diversity
curve for--so this is the number

00:31:24.243 --> 00:31:28.798
of families that you could find;
these are mostly marine

00:31:28.798 --> 00:31:30.450
invertebrate families.
 

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:31.318
Okay?
 

00:31:31.318 --> 00:31:32.838
So the number of families of
organisms.

00:31:32.838 --> 00:31:36.818
This scale goes from 0 up to
about 1000.

00:31:36.818 --> 00:31:39.769
This is the beginning of the
Cambrian, right here.

00:31:39.769 --> 00:31:42.971
This is the Vendian,
and then the Cambrian begins

00:31:42.971 --> 00:31:43.440
here.
 

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.048
This is the Ordovician,
the Silurian,

00:31:46.048 --> 00:31:49.093
Devonian, Carboniferous,
Permian, Triassic,

00:31:49.093 --> 00:31:51.630
Jurassic, Cretaceous,
Tertiary.

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:54.930
So this is the Age of Dinosaurs
here;

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:56.630
this is the Age of Mammals here.
 

00:31:56.630 --> 00:32:00.416
And you can see that most of
the last 550 million years of

00:32:00.416 --> 00:32:03.538
history is a history of marine
invertebrates.

00:32:03.538 --> 00:32:06.630
This is a mass extinction at
the Ordovician.

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:08.769
This is a mass extinction at
the Devonian.

00:32:08.769 --> 00:32:11.771
This is the Permian mass
extinction, and this is the

00:32:11.771 --> 00:32:13.480
Cretaceous mass extinction.
 

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:21.713
The red is the modern fauna,
the green is the Cambrian

00:32:21.713 --> 00:32:30.723
creatures, and the blue is the
stuff that originated in the

00:32:30.723 --> 00:32:32.900
Paleozoic.
 

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.970
So you can see that we still
have--almost all the Cambrian

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:36.940
things are gone.
 

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.881
We still have families of
things that originated in the

00:32:40.881 --> 00:32:43.959
Paleozoic,
and what we think of as the

00:32:43.959 --> 00:32:48.373
modern creatures really started,
some of them started way back

00:32:48.373 --> 00:32:51.404
in the Cambrian,
but they built up a lot in the

00:32:51.404 --> 00:32:56.551
Carboniferous and Permian,
and then radiated again in the

00:32:56.551 --> 00:32:57.660
Triassic.
 

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:02.858
So what caused that big
extinction?

00:33:02.858 --> 00:33:10.509
Well Gondwana was breaking up,
and so--Laurasia was also

00:33:10.509 --> 00:33:18.160
separating from Gondwana--so
Pangaea was breaking up.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.832
At that time there was
large-scale volcanism,

00:33:21.832 --> 00:33:26.838
and at that time there was a
lack of oxygen in the oceans.

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:29.864
If you go to the Black Sea
today--the Black Sea is sort of

00:33:29.864 --> 00:33:32.200
the model for what this ocean
looked like.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:36.761
The top oh twenty meters or so
of the Black Sea is oxygenated

00:33:36.761 --> 00:33:38.358
and has fish in it.
 

00:33:38.358 --> 00:33:42.470
The Black Sea at its deepest
point is about two miles deep,

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:47.119
and everything from twenty
meters, down to the bottom of

00:33:47.119 --> 00:33:50.559
the ocean,
is anoxic, and it stinks like

00:33:50.559 --> 00:33:51.609
rotten eggs.
 

00:33:51.609 --> 00:33:53.279
Okay?
 

00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:57.213
Imagine the entire world's
ocean being in that state:

00:33:57.213 --> 00:34:00.618
a very thin,
oxygenated, clear upper layer;

00:34:00.618 --> 00:34:03.642
and everything below it
basically anoxic:

00:34:03.642 --> 00:34:07.849
no vertebrates can live in it;
it's dominated by bacteria;

00:34:07.849 --> 00:34:09.070
and it stinks like rotten eggs.
 

00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:19.172
Some people have suggested that
there were extraterrestrial

00:34:19.172 --> 00:34:20.820
influences at the time.
 

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:26.795
It's been difficult to find a
meteorite crater of exactly the

00:34:26.795 --> 00:34:27.989
right age.
 

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:32.134
It doesn't mean there aren't
any--absence of evidence is not

00:34:32.134 --> 00:34:34.931
evidence of absence--
but plate tectonics has

00:34:34.931 --> 00:34:38.070
remodeled the surface of the
planet extensively since then,

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:40.824
and it's quite possible that
there was a big meteorite crater

00:34:40.824 --> 00:34:42.889
but it got subducted and it's
been erased,

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:44.510
so that we can't see it.
 

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:47.871
At any rate,
this is a fertile area for

00:34:47.871 --> 00:34:50.110
speculation,
and people have thought of

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:52.992
asteroids,
comets and supernovas that

00:34:52.992 --> 00:34:58.489
might have affected the planet
at the end of the Permian.

00:34:58.489 --> 00:35:02.702
It seems likely that it's the
breakup of the continents and

00:35:02.702 --> 00:35:06.150
large-scale volcanism,
but I can't really claim that

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:08.570
we really know what caused the
extinction.

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:12.588
If you go to Siberia,
you can find what are called

00:35:12.588 --> 00:35:14.309
the Siberian traps.
 

00:35:14.309 --> 00:35:17.496
These are among the largest
flood basalt lava flows on the

00:35:17.496 --> 00:35:19.900
planet, and they have just the
right age;

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.619
they're at about 251 million
years.

00:35:22.619 --> 00:35:30.579
And we know that the extinction
lasted not too long;

00:35:30.579 --> 00:35:32.070
it was a few 10,000 years.
 

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:34.199
It happened both on land and in
the oceans,

00:35:34.199 --> 00:35:39.204
and the organisms that went out
in the oceans were the ones that

00:35:39.204 --> 00:35:44.050
were particularly susceptible to
changes in the gas regime.

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:46.230
So that would suggest very high
CO2 levels.

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:53.139
So one idea is this:
there were massive volcanic

00:35:53.139 --> 00:35:54.920
outbreaks in Siberia.
 

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.550
That caused global warming.
 

00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:00.795
That global warming then
triggered the release of a huge

00:36:00.795 --> 00:36:04.579
amount of methane that was
stored in the ocean.

00:36:04.579 --> 00:36:05.460
Okay?
 

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.789
This is this Black Sea-like
world ocean.

00:36:07.789 --> 00:36:11.387
The methane then gets oxidized
to carbon dioxide,

00:36:11.387 --> 00:36:15.135
and essentially extinctions
happen by poisoning and

00:36:15.135 --> 00:36:16.409
asphyxiation.
 

00:36:16.409 --> 00:36:20.338
We do see a signature in the
rocks that indicate that there

00:36:20.338 --> 00:36:24.606
was an amount of carbon that was
oxidized at that point equal to

00:36:24.606 --> 00:36:28.130
several times the current
biomass of the planet.

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:32.559
So carbon levels really dropped.
 

00:36:32.559 --> 00:36:36.315
I didn't list it here,
but I believe that at the end

00:36:36.315 --> 00:36:40.291
of this process the percentage
of oxygen in the earth's

00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:42.280
atmosphere is about 7%.
 

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.844
Well that's as though I took
you suddenly in an elevator

00:36:45.844 --> 00:36:48.179
right to the top of Mount
Everest;

00:36:48.179 --> 00:36:51.510
that's hard to deal with.
 

00:36:54.989 --> 00:37:00.030
Okay, that's one of the more
plausible hypotheses for the

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:02.280
end-Permian extinction.
 

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:06.650
The Cretaceous extinction is at
just about 65 million years ago;

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:09.032
slightly less,
63 and a half,

00:37:09.032 --> 00:37:10.989
64 million years ago.
 

00:37:10.989 --> 00:37:15.092
And we do know that there was a
big meteorite that hit the

00:37:15.092 --> 00:37:17.539
Yucatan right at the right time.
 

00:37:17.539 --> 00:37:19.989
It probably did trigger
extinctions.

00:37:19.989 --> 00:37:22.518
Mechanisms aren't completely
clear.

00:37:22.518 --> 00:37:24.349
It wasn't necessarily the sole
cause.

00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:27.610
That meteorite in the Yucatan
could have set off massive

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:30.340
volcanism in India,
and the reason is this:

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.137
The earth is a spherical lens,
and if you throw a big rock

00:37:33.137 --> 00:37:36.295
into one side of the earth,
the energy from the impact

00:37:36.295 --> 00:37:38.829
radiates out,
reflects off the walls of the

00:37:38.829 --> 00:37:40.724
earth,
and comes back together at a

00:37:40.724 --> 00:37:42.400
single point on the other side.
 

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:46.226
That single point on the other
side was focused into western

00:37:46.226 --> 00:37:49.923
India, at the time that India
was moving across the Indian

00:37:49.923 --> 00:37:51.869
Ocean, before it hit Asia.
 

00:37:51.869 --> 00:37:54.110
It was just in the right spot,
on the other side.

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:57.003
And that's where those lava
flows are, and those lava flows

00:37:57.003 --> 00:37:58.500
have exactly the right date.
 

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.304
So there's some reason to think
that this might actually have

00:38:01.304 --> 00:38:01.820
happened.
 

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:05.358
If you go to the Hindu and
Buddhist cave temples of the

00:38:05.358 --> 00:38:08.503
Western Ghats in India,
you will be in those lava

00:38:08.503 --> 00:38:09.159
flows.
 

00:38:09.159 --> 00:38:14.340
They are massively thick and
they cover a huge area.

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:18.382
So that's not demonstrated,
but certainly the meteorite is

00:38:18.382 --> 00:38:19.659
well-documented.
 

00:38:19.659 --> 00:38:22.510
It probably looked something
like this.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:27.510
So this is about a 30 kilometer
wide meteorite.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:31.644
It's coming in probably at
about 100,000 miles an hour,

00:38:31.644 --> 00:38:36.239
and of course it completely
fragments and sends up ejecta.

00:38:36.239 --> 00:38:41.182
And since it's hitting into a
shallow sea, it sends up a large

00:38:41.182 --> 00:38:43.289
tsunami, a mega-tsunami.
 

00:38:43.289 --> 00:38:47.802
There is evidence in Texas and
Oklahoma that the waves crossing

00:38:47.802 --> 00:38:52.461
the southern coast of the United
States at that point were one to

00:38:52.461 --> 00:38:54.210
two kilometers high.
 

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:59.135
So a big event;
and burning debris rains down

00:38:59.135 --> 00:39:00.579
across the planet.
 

00:39:00.579 --> 00:39:03.824
If you go to Mexico now,
you can see the outer ring of

00:39:03.824 --> 00:39:04.619
the crater.
 

00:39:04.619 --> 00:39:08.376
It's a series of freshwater
wells in the cracked limestone

00:39:08.376 --> 00:39:10.090
pavement of the Yucatan.
 

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:14.532
If you look with geological
probes under water,

00:39:14.532 --> 00:39:18.010
you can see the rim of the
crater.

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:22.130
This is a distance here of
about 200 miles across.

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:23.500
It's a big crater.
 

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:28.527
So this is Simon Conway
Morris's reconstruction of what

00:39:28.527 --> 00:39:29.460
happens.
 

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.418
Of course, when the rock falls
on your head,

00:39:32.418 --> 00:39:34.760
everything's killed right
there.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.250
There are giant earthquakes.
 

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:40.539
Then within ten minutes,
the rock falling out of the air

00:39:40.539 --> 00:39:43.289
ignites all of the forests of
North America.

00:39:43.289 --> 00:39:48.402
About ten hours later tsunamis
are pretty much covering the

00:39:48.402 --> 00:39:53.338
planet, taking out anything
within one kilometer vertical

00:39:53.338 --> 00:39:55.630
distance of the ocean.
 

00:39:55.630 --> 00:40:00.096
Probably the first extinctions
of things that have a broad

00:40:00.096 --> 00:40:03.780
geographic range are occurring
within a week.

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.478
There's a very,
very dusty atmosphere for about

00:40:06.478 --> 00:40:10.117
nine months, and that induces a
nuclear winter that lasts about

00:40:10.117 --> 00:40:10.940
ten years.
 

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:13.534
We know it probably didn't go
on much more than ten years,

00:40:13.534 --> 00:40:15.630
because the plants do not
notice this event.

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:18.985
The animals get killed,
but the plants have a seed bank

00:40:18.985 --> 00:40:22.030
in the soil, and the seeds can
make it through.

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:24.570
So the plants don't notice this
event very much.

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:28.510
Continental vegetation starts
to recover.

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:32.204
The planet is pretty much
covered with ferns for about

00:40:32.204 --> 00:40:36.177
1000 years, but within 1000
years we start getting forests

00:40:36.177 --> 00:40:38.268
back and things like that.
 

00:40:38.268 --> 00:40:47.753
Then it takes the deep water in
the ocean several thousand years

00:40:47.753 --> 00:40:49.710
to recover.
 

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:53.974
It takes about 50 to 100,000
years for the oceans to become

00:40:53.974 --> 00:40:55.739
well oxygenated again.
 

00:40:55.739 --> 00:40:58.469
It's thought that some
populations of dinosaurs,

00:40:58.469 --> 00:41:01.052
some places in the world,
managed to go on for about

00:41:01.052 --> 00:41:03.934
another 100,000 years,
before they all died out,

00:41:03.934 --> 00:41:07.039
and that the ammonites,
the last ammonites went out

00:41:07.039 --> 00:41:09.929
about 300,000 years later;
and then you can see the rest

00:41:09.929 --> 00:41:10.800
of this going on.
 

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.856
It took about 15 to 25 million
years after the extinction to

00:41:14.856 --> 00:41:18.775
repopulate the planet to the
level of biodiversity it had,

00:41:18.775 --> 00:41:22.478
before the meteorite hit;
and that is an estimate of how

00:41:22.478 --> 00:41:26.010
long it might take the planet to
recover from the current human

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:29.534
caused mass extinction,
which is going to be roughly an

00:41:29.534 --> 00:41:33.250
extinction of the same size as
one caused by a meteorite.

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:36.018
This is just a bit of evidence.
 

00:41:36.018 --> 00:41:38.213
This is a section--I'm not
going to run through all of

00:41:38.213 --> 00:41:40.449
this, I just wanted you to have
this, if you wanted to,

00:41:40.449 --> 00:41:42.190
so you could see some of the
evidence.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:48.159
This is a deep sea core off of
the Florida Coast,

00:41:48.159 --> 00:41:51.632
and it marks the boundary
between the Cretaceous and the

00:41:51.632 --> 00:41:54.954
Tertiary,
and in this chunk of it right

00:41:54.954 --> 00:41:59.445
here are the impact ejecta;
so there is basically glassy,

00:41:59.445 --> 00:42:03.405
tectite globules and things
like that, and shocked quartz,

00:42:03.405 --> 00:42:04.170
in here.
 

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:08.159
And the iridium--the famous
iridium anomaly--

00:42:08.159 --> 00:42:10.637
iridium is enriched in
meteorites and poor on the

00:42:10.637 --> 00:42:13.460
earth's surface,
and you pick up a lot of that

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:14.920
element right in here.
 

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.367
So this is the kind of evidence
from around the world that

00:42:17.367 --> 00:42:19.000
indicates that this was a big
event.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.382
So that's the end-Cretaceous
extinction, and it seems to be

00:42:22.382 --> 00:42:25.137
linked to the meteorite;
and may not only have been

00:42:25.137 --> 00:42:27.420
caused by the meteorite,
there were also volcanic

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:28.039
eruptions.
 

00:42:28.039 --> 00:42:32.280
I'd now like to do a little bit
of local catastrophe--

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.599
this is on a more frequent
timescale--

00:42:34.599 --> 00:42:37.539
just to convince you that
sometimes,

00:42:37.539 --> 00:42:42.360
on a shorter time period,
conditions are quite unusual.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:47.085
So major earthquakes;
I mean, we've all experienced,

00:42:47.085 --> 00:42:51.099
in 2006, the big tsunami in
Indonesia.

00:42:51.099 --> 00:42:52.739
There's several of those per
century.

00:42:52.739 --> 00:42:56.673
We haven't really had a
volcanic eruption in our

00:42:56.673 --> 00:43:01.780
lifetimes that came anywhere
close to Santorini or Tambora.

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.980
Krakatoa was much smaller than
Tambora;

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:07.530
and these things caused
tsunamis and global cooling.

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:12.590
Then there are the gigantic
eruptions.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:16.215
Eruptions that were occurring
in the Cascade Mountains during

00:43:16.215 --> 00:43:19.842
the Pliocene would do things
like drop clouds of volcanic ash

00:43:19.842 --> 00:43:23.469
onto wandering herds of wooly
rhinoceroses in Nebraska,

00:43:23.469 --> 00:43:25.699
2000 miles away.
 

00:43:25.699 --> 00:43:28.952
And when the Phlegrean Fields
at Naples went up,

00:43:28.952 --> 00:43:31.719
they dropped ash into Kiev,
in Russia.

00:43:31.719 --> 00:43:35.222
The Phlegrean Fields are still
active, and they're a rather

00:43:35.222 --> 00:43:38.059
heavily populated suburb of
Naples right now.

00:43:38.059 --> 00:43:40.932
As a property owner,
you have to kind of wonder what

00:43:40.932 --> 00:43:42.059
you're sitting on.
 

00:43:42.059 --> 00:43:47.739
These come fairly rarely,
every 10,000 to 1000,000 years.

00:43:47.739 --> 00:43:50.492
Then there are undersea
landslides, and these can

00:43:50.492 --> 00:43:52.268
produce really huge tsunamis.
 

00:43:52.268 --> 00:43:56.590
So if the Nile Delta,
or the Mississippi River Delta,

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:59.610
or the Amazon Delta loses
structural stability and sloughs

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:02.657
off into deep water,
dropping cubic kilometers of

00:44:02.657 --> 00:44:05.610
sediment at one go,
you get a very big tsunami.

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:06.719
I'll show you one in a minute.
 

00:44:06.719 --> 00:44:07.699
Okay?
 

00:44:07.699 --> 00:44:10.195
And then there are super
floods, and we've had some of

00:44:10.195 --> 00:44:11.610
those in Eastern Washington.
 

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:13.530
They've occurred in Siberia and
Manitoba.

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:16.677
They happen at the ends of Ice
Ages, when the glaciers are

00:44:16.677 --> 00:44:17.230
melting.
 

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:20.809
So here is an example of a mega
tsunami,

00:44:20.809 --> 00:44:25.079
and this is what happened when
the West Coast of the Island of

00:44:25.079 --> 00:44:28.789
Hawaii fell into the water about
125,000 years ago.

00:44:28.789 --> 00:44:32.054
It dropped a chunk of rock that
was probably about 20 kilometers

00:44:32.054 --> 00:44:33.902
wide,
by about 1 or 2 kilometers

00:44:33.902 --> 00:44:35.829
deep, by about 8 kilometers
high,

00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:39.298
onto the floor of the ocean,
and by the time it had gotten

00:44:39.298 --> 00:44:41.737
this far,
it was moving 500 kilometers

00:44:41.737 --> 00:44:45.320
per hour,
and it shoved blocks of island

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:50.659
that were about 1 kilometer long
out into deep water,

00:44:50.659 --> 00:44:52.239
about 200 kilometers away.
 

00:44:52.239 --> 00:44:55.882
And that's just about the right
velocity, in that depth of

00:44:55.882 --> 00:44:57.800
ocean, to entrain a tsunami.
 

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:02.650
And this is a geological model
of how high this tsunami was.

00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:07.590
So the landslide is here,
and then the tsunami goes out;

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:11.250
it actually goes well up into
the top of Lanai here.

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:13.230
This is in meters.
 

00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:16.853
So when you start getting red,
you are up at 1000 feet above

00:45:16.853 --> 00:45:17.590
sea level.
 

00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:21.306
The highest point of the run-up
of this tsunami was right here

00:45:21.306 --> 00:45:22.159
at Ho'okena.
 

00:45:22.159 --> 00:45:26.150
It went up 2400 feet,
according to that.

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:27.940
And there had been previous
ones;

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:30.599
other pieces of island had
fallen off at various points.

00:45:30.599 --> 00:45:35.347
There is a ring of coral that
goes up to about 1500 feet

00:45:35.347 --> 00:45:37.965
elevation,
right here, from an earlier

00:45:37.965 --> 00:45:40.240
tsunami,
and perched on top of the

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:44.579
island of Lanai is a lake of sea
water that was deposited on top

00:45:44.579 --> 00:45:47.659
of the island,
by a mega tsunami.

00:45:47.659 --> 00:45:51.309
So sometimes the surf is really
up.

00:45:51.309 --> 00:45:54.659
These are big waves.
 

00:45:54.659 --> 00:45:58.367
This is a recent volcanic
eruption, just to show you what

00:45:58.367 --> 00:45:59.230
it will do.
 

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:03.239
This is pumping an awful lot of
ash into the atmosphere.

00:46:03.239 --> 00:46:07.018
This is at 22 kilometers
elevation, and this actually

00:46:07.018 --> 00:46:11.014
caused global cooling and
beautiful sunsets for a couple

00:46:11.014 --> 00:46:11.960
of years.
 

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:15.806
And then these are the super
floods of eastern Washington

00:46:15.806 --> 00:46:18.349
that went down the Columbia
River,

00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:22.891
about a kilometer high,
and took an awful lot of the

00:46:22.891 --> 00:46:25.829
soil of eastern Washington off.
 

00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:29.385
And that's what happened when a
giant lake suddenly caused a

00:46:29.385 --> 00:46:32.159
glacial dam to burst and the
flood went out.

00:46:32.159 --> 00:46:32.860
Okay?
 

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:36.597
This is the kind of a boulder
that could be easily moved by a

00:46:36.597 --> 00:46:37.719
flood that size.
 

00:46:37.719 --> 00:46:41.710
So basically the idea of this
lecture was to show you that

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:45.559
life changed the planet,
and mainly it was bacteria that

00:46:45.559 --> 00:46:48.469
did it;
that the planet and the

00:46:48.469 --> 00:46:53.402
extraterrestrial environment
have had occasional major

00:46:53.402 --> 00:46:55.170
impacts on life.
 

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:58.324
This big picture view,
this macroevolutionary view,

00:46:58.324 --> 00:47:02.300
describes a world that's really
qualitatively different from our

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:03.690
normal experience.
 

00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:07.014
And we're going to reconstruct
what happened to some of those

00:47:07.014 --> 00:47:09.230
things next time in the fossil
record.

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.760
Prof: Good morning
everybody.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.189
We will be returning the exams
on Thursday.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.348
They're being graded now and
we'll return them to you on

00:00:11.348 --> 00:00:11.980
Thursday.
 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.940
And I've always found,
I've found in the past,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.860
that having--once we finish the
midterm exam,

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.005
and all of you have had a
chance to go back over the

00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:21.605
material,
mastered it,

00:00:21.605 --> 00:00:26.719
is the ideal time to begin to
talk about a selection of a

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:30.190
paper topic,
a term paper topic.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.108
And I'm going to concentrate on
that particular issue in today's

00:00:34.108 --> 00:00:36.410
class, the choice of a paper
topic.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.092
Right before Spring Break is
also a good time to begin

00:00:40.092 --> 00:00:43.200
thinking about this,
because there are a lucky few

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.700
of you in here who are actually
going to Rome,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.447
for Spring Break,
and there are others that are

00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:51.914
heading home to California,
possibly near Malibu -- might

00:00:51.914 --> 00:00:54.340
have a chance to go to the Getty
Museum,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.320
in Malibu, which is based on an
important villa,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.000
ancient Roman villa at
Herculaneum,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.179
as well as other travels that
may give you some ideas about

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:05.549
potential paper topics.
 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.477
And don't underestimate just
the experience of architecture

00:01:09.477 --> 00:01:11.956
of any period,
in terms of inspiring you,

00:01:11.956 --> 00:01:14.510
as you go to whatever city
you're headed toward,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.349
or even whatever small town
you're headed toward.

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:22.415
Looking at what's around you
can be a stimulation to making a

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.379
selection on a paper topic.
 

00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:28.030
So I want to go over that with
you today.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.176
Also I'm going to show you some
magnificent parts of the Roman

00:01:32.176 --> 00:01:36.186
Empire, as a prelude to what
we'll be doing when we get back

00:01:36.186 --> 00:01:37.750
after Spring Break.
 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.397
And that is,
although we'll spend--we'll do

00:01:40.397 --> 00:01:43.110
one lecture on Hadrian and the
Pantheon,

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.610
and Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli,
and one on a colony in Italy,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.290
namely Ostia, the port of Rome.
 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.080
From that point on we'll make
our way around the rest of the

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.790
Roman Empire.
 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.540
We'll go to North Africa,
we'll go to Jordan.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.420
We'll go to other parts of the
Middle East.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.159
We'll go to France and Spain.
 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.399
So we'll be spending spring
going around the Roman Empire to

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.340
some extraordinary spots.
 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.848
And I think by introducing you
to some of those today,

00:02:10.848 --> 00:02:13.960
vis-à-vis the paper
topics,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.436
will get you in the mood,
I hope, for that kind of

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:21.692
whirlwind tour that we're going
to take in the second half of

00:02:21.692 --> 00:02:22.970
this semester.
 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.281
Now I'd like to spend the rest
of the time again showing you

00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:28.258
some magnificent places,
giving you a sense of the three

00:02:28.258 --> 00:02:31.846
options for the paper topics,
and specific monuments and

00:02:31.846 --> 00:02:35.241
sites that I hope you'll
consider as possibilities for

00:02:35.241 --> 00:02:36.139
your paper.
 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.704
And again, as I mentioned,
it's also a good chance for us

00:02:39.704 --> 00:02:43.460
to begin to experience the
provinces of the Roman Empire.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.377
Obviously I've chosen topics
that are ones that for the most

00:02:47.377 --> 00:02:48.852
part--
there's one or two

00:02:48.852 --> 00:02:51.783
exceptions--but for the most
part are not topics that I'm

00:02:51.783 --> 00:02:55.703
going to be going over in class,
to give you an opportunity to

00:02:55.703 --> 00:03:00.120
look into a part of the world
that we may not cover in class,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.167
but also to be able to use what
you have learned about Roman

00:03:05.167 --> 00:03:10.471
buildings in general to decipher
buildings that you haven't yet

00:03:10.471 --> 00:03:11.840
seen before.
 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.128
The first of these--well the
first option;

00:03:14.128 --> 00:03:16.680
there are three options,
as I mentioned before--

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.561
and Option 1 is a
straightforward research paper

00:03:19.561 --> 00:03:22.227
that is comparable,
obviously, to research papers

00:03:22.227 --> 00:03:24.168
that you've done,
not only in other Art History

00:03:24.168 --> 00:03:26.163
courses,
but in other History courses

00:03:26.163 --> 00:03:27.918
and other--
whatever courses,

00:03:27.918 --> 00:03:31.013
even science courses--
a straight research paper in

00:03:31.013 --> 00:03:34.458
which you have a topic that you
do a considerable amount of

00:03:34.458 --> 00:03:36.484
reading on,
focused reading,

00:03:36.484 --> 00:03:40.169
on that particular topic,
and I give you bibliography for

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:40.970
all of these.
 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.637
And, by the way,
all of these,

00:03:42.637 --> 00:03:45.742
pretty much all of these
bibliographical sources are on

00:03:45.742 --> 00:03:48.274
reserve, in the Art and
Architecture Library,

00:03:48.274 --> 00:03:49.538
for this course.
 

00:03:49.538 --> 00:03:53.311
With a group this size,
obviously if a number of you

00:03:53.311 --> 00:03:56.567
choose the same topic,
I don't want a situation and

00:03:56.567 --> 00:03:58.474
whoever--
the early bird catches the

00:03:58.474 --> 00:04:01.719
worm--whoever gets the book out
of Sterling has it and nobody

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:02.908
else can get to it.
 

00:04:02.908 --> 00:04:05.860
So I have put the books on
reserve for this course.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.788
I know that creates other
challenges,

00:04:07.788 --> 00:04:09.908
because you can't take it home
with you,

00:04:09.908 --> 00:04:11.360
but--and it means you do need
to share--

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.099
but it will mean that it will
be there for you,

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.199
in the library.
 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.670
In some instances there are
second copies at the University.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.762
So again, in that sense,
the early bird can catch the

00:04:20.762 --> 00:04:24.274
worm, if there is a second or
third copy that can be checked

00:04:24.274 --> 00:04:24.750
out.
 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.817
So I do urge you,
if you have a pretty good sense

00:04:26.817 --> 00:04:28.800
of what it is that you may want
to work on,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.982
and want to pick up a book or
two before you leave for Spring

00:04:31.982 --> 00:04:34.353
Break,
the next couple of days would

00:04:34.353 --> 00:04:35.920
be the time to do that.
 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.680
So the first topic--so under
Research Paper,

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.375
again a straightforward
research paper in which you do

00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:44.173
some reading,
you do some looking,

00:04:44.173 --> 00:04:47.901
you think about this monument;
you think about its own special

00:04:47.901 --> 00:04:51.096
characteristics,
as well as where it fits into

00:04:51.096 --> 00:04:54.079
in the evolution of Roman
architecture.

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:57.000
And one hopes,
of course, that you'll do both

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.894
synthetic --
once you've done your reading

00:04:58.894 --> 00:05:02.500
and your research,
that you will present this work

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.439
of architecture synthetically.
 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:08.220
But at the same time I hope
that you will have a thesis,

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.764
that there will be something
that you will come up with on

00:05:10.764 --> 00:05:12.127
your own,
a major point,

00:05:12.127 --> 00:05:14.613
a major focus,
that you'll want to have and

00:05:14.613 --> 00:05:16.269
that you'll want to make.
 

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:19.976
And that you'll want to use the
paper toward arguing some thesis

00:05:19.976 --> 00:05:21.502
of your own--
even though,

00:05:21.502 --> 00:05:24.072
for the most part,
it will be a synthesis of what

00:05:24.072 --> 00:05:26.057
you read,
what's understood--and a

00:05:26.057 --> 00:05:26.970
placement of it.
 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.850
Since you now know Rome itself
particularly well,

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.949
if you choose a topic of a
building,

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:33.720
or a group of buildings that
are outside Rome,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.970
the relationship of what's
going on,

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.199
on the periphery,
to what is going on in the

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.084
center,
and the relationship of center

00:05:42.084 --> 00:05:43.079
to periphery.
 

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:46.702
So the first topic I give you
under Research Paper is the

00:05:46.702 --> 00:05:49.550
Roman city of Corinth,
which is in Greece.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.896
This would be a good paper
topic for the classicists among

00:05:52.896 --> 00:05:54.920
you;
and I know there are some.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.649
Anyone who's into--who's fairly
well steeped in Greek culture,

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:01.649
as well as Roman culture and
civilization,

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:05.600
who might want to look back at
a Greek city,

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.959
a city that was already very
built up under the Greeks,

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:12.180
as early as the Archaic Period.
 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.803
This is a view,
for example,

00:06:14.803 --> 00:06:18.790
of the Greek Archaic Temple at
Corinth.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.211
So a Greek city,
a very well developed Greek

00:06:21.211 --> 00:06:23.970
city, that is eventually taken
over by the Romans,

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.730
and the Romans remake it in the
Roman manner.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.252
They add typical Roman
buildings to it,

00:06:29.252 --> 00:06:31.910
create a kind of mini Rome,
in Greece.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.132
But it's interesting to see the
way in which those new buildings

00:06:35.132 --> 00:06:37.639
blend with those that were built
there earlier.

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:42.762
I also mention here not only
the Archaic Temple at Corinth,

00:06:42.762 --> 00:06:46.649
but also the so-called Isthmus
at Corinth.

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:49.029
You might remember,
from our conversation about

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:51.720
Julius Caesar and the
architecture that he built,

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.745
that Julius Caesar was the one
who built a canal at the Isthmus

00:06:56.745 --> 00:06:57.800
of Corinth.
 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.125
And the canal that is still
visible and used at Corinth

00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:02.983
today--
which you see an excellent view

00:07:02.983 --> 00:07:04.709
of on the left-hand side of the
screen--

00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:09.338
is essentially the same canal
that was built initially,

00:07:09.338 --> 00:07:12.550
or begun initially,
by Julius Caesar.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.500
So that gives you some sense of
a Roman addition to the scene.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.670
And I show you just one other
example.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.408
There are quite a number of
buildings preserved from

00:07:21.408 --> 00:07:22.860
Corinth, Roman buildings.
 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.959
So one could do--for a paper
like this,

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:28.810
one could do an overview of the
Roman city,

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.375
all the pieces of the Roman
city, how the urban fabric

00:07:31.375 --> 00:07:33.608
worked,
or you could choose one or two

00:07:33.608 --> 00:07:35.884
buildings at Corinth,
at Roman Corinth,

00:07:35.884 --> 00:07:36.930
to concentrate on.
 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.353
I show you, for example,
a view of the remains of the

00:07:40.353 --> 00:07:42.000
Roman Baths at Corinth.
 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.029
And what's interesting about
these--

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:46.310
and you can pick this out on
your own already,

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.634
just by looking at this one
view--what's interesting about

00:07:49.634 --> 00:07:53.310
these is although they look back
to Roman bath architecture,

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:57.288
in Italy, you can see that this
bath is made entirely of

00:07:57.288 --> 00:08:00.892
cut-stone construction,
which is quite different from

00:08:00.892 --> 00:08:03.449
either the small baths we saw at
Pompeii,

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:06.009
the Stabian Baths or the Forum
Baths,

00:08:06.009 --> 00:08:09.019
or the later imperial baths --
the Baths of Titus,

00:08:09.019 --> 00:08:11.759
for example,
that we've already explored,

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:13.889
where concrete construction was
used.

00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:14.980
Here stone was used.
 

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.470
Why was stone used?
 

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.259
Because there was a very long
tradition,

00:08:18.259 --> 00:08:20.947
already begun in Greece,
from the Archaic Period through

00:08:20.947 --> 00:08:23.389
the Classical Period to the
Hellenistic Period,

00:08:23.389 --> 00:08:25.528
of using stone for architecture.
 

00:08:25.528 --> 00:08:28.934
And the architects,
in this particular part of the

00:08:28.934 --> 00:08:31.365
world,
because stone was so readily

00:08:31.365 --> 00:08:33.730
available--
and especially marble,

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.259
but other kinds of stone as
well--

00:08:36.259 --> 00:08:40.077
so readily available,
and because the architects and

00:08:40.077 --> 00:08:44.645
designers in this part of the
world were so skilled at carving

00:08:44.645 --> 00:08:47.635
stone,
it was natural for them to use

00:08:47.635 --> 00:08:49.730
stone in their construction.
 

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.864
So we see that they are not
seduced by concrete domes and

00:08:53.864 --> 00:08:56.157
the like--
don't use concrete in their

00:08:56.157 --> 00:08:57.950
architecture,
which you're going to see,

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.309
not only today but in the
future,

00:08:59.309 --> 00:09:02.070
is really an Italian phenomenon.
 

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:05.653
Concrete is picked up very
sparingly in the Roman

00:09:05.653 --> 00:09:06.548
provinces.
 

00:09:06.548 --> 00:09:10.288
Stone construction tends to be
the norm, for the most part,

00:09:10.288 --> 00:09:12.158
and we see that at Corinth.
 

00:09:12.158 --> 00:09:15.345
So the whole question of
building materials becomes very

00:09:15.345 --> 00:09:16.038
important.
 

00:09:16.038 --> 00:09:18.524
But one would ask oneself,
if one looked at the Baths at

00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:20.558
Corinth for example,
what is the plan like?

00:09:20.558 --> 00:09:24.668
How similar is it to the small
baths that we saw at Pompeii?

00:09:24.668 --> 00:09:28.192
How similar is it to the
imperial bath building,

00:09:28.192 --> 00:09:32.691
that we saw the symmetrical and
axial--imperial bath building

00:09:32.691 --> 00:09:35.840
that we saw, for example,
under Titus.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.970
What kinds of materials was it
made of?

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.822
What is the layout of rooms;
the men's section,

00:09:39.822 --> 00:09:40.580
women's section?
 

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:45.673
All the obvious questions that
you would want to put to this

00:09:45.673 --> 00:09:47.658
particular structure.
 

00:09:47.658 --> 00:09:53.428
Also in the eastern part of the
Empire, the city of Ephesus,

00:09:53.428 --> 00:09:57.827
in what was ancient Asia Minor,
modern Turkey,

00:09:57.827 --> 00:10:01.250
on the western coast of Turkey.
 

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.629
An extraordinary place.
 

00:10:02.629 --> 00:10:07.576
It too had a very long history,
not only historical and

00:10:07.576 --> 00:10:11.881
cultural and political,
but also in terms of its

00:10:11.881 --> 00:10:15.169
architecture;
built up already in the Greek

00:10:15.169 --> 00:10:17.259
period, just as Greece itself
was.

00:10:17.259 --> 00:10:22.644
And one of the most famous
temples at Ephesus was the

00:10:22.644 --> 00:10:25.960
Temple of Artemis,
at Ephesus.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.278
And I show you a coin of that
temple here.

00:10:28.278 --> 00:10:31.855
It was renowned worldwide,
and pilgrims came from all over

00:10:31.855 --> 00:10:34.678
the Hellenistic and Roman world,
to see it.

00:10:34.678 --> 00:10:38.256
And I show you a representation
on this coin of what the Temple

00:10:38.256 --> 00:10:40.450
of Artemis, in Ephesus,
looked like.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:44.202
And you can see here that it
had eight columns across the

00:10:44.202 --> 00:10:44.740
front.
 

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.860
They were Ionic columns;
at least at one point.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.642
It was rebuilt over a number of
years and that got changed over

00:10:50.642 --> 00:10:51.070
time.
 

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.590
But we see it here,
with its Ionic columns,

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.851
with its pedimental decoration,
and with the columns spread out

00:10:57.851 --> 00:11:01.683
in the center,
in order to reveal the cult

00:11:01.683 --> 00:11:03.559
statue of Artemis.
 

00:11:03.559 --> 00:11:05.690
And what a statue it was.
 

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.980
I show it to you, a copy of it.
 

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.702
A very well endowed Artemis,
as you can see here,

00:11:10.702 --> 00:11:12.860
on the left-hand side of the
screen.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.110
And there are tons and tons of
copies of these,

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:19.200
and this is one of those that
gives us a very good sense of

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.740
what this cult statue of
Artemis,

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.940
in this famous temple,
looked like.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.830
And you can see that she's had
a very long afterlife.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.990
It's very tempting to use her
in all kinds of later ways.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.471
And as you can see in this
wonderful view of the Villa

00:11:34.471 --> 00:11:37.061
d'Este,
at Tivoli, in Italy--which is

00:11:37.061 --> 00:11:39.860
very close to Hadrian's Villa at
Tivoli--

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:46.980
a Renaissance area with lots of
fountains and so on,

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.000
and you can see how they've
taken Artemis,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.460
or Diana of Ephesus,
and made her into a fountain.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:57.359
So she comes up in all kinds of
later contexts,

00:11:57.359 --> 00:11:58.798
as you can see.
 

00:11:58.798 --> 00:12:03.263
With regard to the Roman city,
the city of--the Roman city of

00:12:03.263 --> 00:12:06.090
Ephesus is extremely well
preserved.

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.533
It's one of the best preserved
Roman cities today,

00:12:09.533 --> 00:12:13.190
up there with places like
Pompeii and Herculaneum.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:16.577
But, as you can see from two
buildings from Ephesus,

00:12:16.577 --> 00:12:20.428
it is very different from
either Pompeii or Herculaneum.

00:12:20.428 --> 00:12:23.854
It is essentially a marble
city, and it's another example

00:12:23.854 --> 00:12:26.788
of the fact that in Greece and
in Asia Minor,

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:30.951
marble construction and using
the traditional language of

00:12:30.951 --> 00:12:33.365
architecture,
as developed by the

00:12:33.365 --> 00:12:37.043
Greeks--columns and pediments
and walls and the roofs that

00:12:37.043 --> 00:12:40.491
they support--
remains the way of going about

00:12:40.491 --> 00:12:41.590
construction.
 

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.270
And I show you here,
for example,

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:48.879
the very well-preserved Arch of
Augustus at Ephesus,

00:12:48.879 --> 00:12:54.385
which gives you the sense of
the kind of stone construction

00:12:54.385 --> 00:12:56.759
that was used for that.
 

00:12:56.759 --> 00:13:00.070
And perhaps more interesting is
the shrine that I show you--

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.330
the shrine or the temple--that
I show you here on the right,

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.250
which is the Temple of Hadrian,
the emperor Hadrian,

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.678
at Ephesus, that was put up in
honor of Hadrian.

00:13:09.678 --> 00:13:12.928
It's a very small temple,
more a shrine.

00:13:12.928 --> 00:13:16.684
And what's interesting about it
is again that it is made out of

00:13:16.684 --> 00:13:19.177
stone;
think of this in relationship

00:13:19.177 --> 00:13:20.833
to the--
we haven't looked at it,

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:22.860
but I know it's a building you
all know well--

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:27.116
the Pantheon in Rome,
which of course is one of the

00:13:27.116 --> 00:13:31.460
greatest concrete buildings the
Romans produced,

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.190
or is the greatest concrete
building the Romans produced.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.860
If you compare that with its
very large scale,

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.000
with its concrete construction,
to this,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.969
you get a very good sense of
the difference between Rome and

00:13:42.969 --> 00:13:45.370
Ephesus,
in the Hadrianic period.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.120
This is again a very small
building.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.269
You can see it's made entirely
of stone.

00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:52.129
It has columns,
it has pilasters.

00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:56.386
It is very highly decorated;
in fact, almost overly ornate,

00:13:56.386 --> 00:13:59.005
with that decoration almost
dematerializing the

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:00.428
architectural members.
 

00:14:00.428 --> 00:14:03.860
And you can also see a motif
that we have seen before in

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.115
painting,
but never before in built

00:14:06.115 --> 00:14:09.263
architecture,
and that is a straight lintel,

00:14:09.263 --> 00:14:12.178
and then the arcuation of the
lintel,

00:14:12.178 --> 00:14:14.480
and then the straight lintel
again;

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.682
and that is housed in a
pediment, or least part of a

00:14:18.682 --> 00:14:19.590
pediment.
 

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.335
We can't tell,
but you can see on both sides

00:14:23.335 --> 00:14:28.038
the pediment begins to rise,
but it's not completed.

00:14:28.038 --> 00:14:30.971
Now whether it's just broken
off, or whether it was what we

00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:33.500
would call a partial or broken
triangular pediment,

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.168
we're not absolutely certain.
 

00:14:35.168 --> 00:14:38.058
My guess is it was a broken
triangular pediment.

00:14:38.058 --> 00:14:41.366
So we have this arcuated lintel
emerging from the broken

00:14:41.366 --> 00:14:42.690
triangular pediment.
 

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.830
We're going to see that this
motif of straight,

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:49.038
arcuated lintel is very popular
in the Hadrianic period,

00:14:49.038 --> 00:14:52.340
and even brought to Italy from
these experiments in the East.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.360
But again we saw this in
painting.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.037
We saw this in that painting
that was on the midterm,

00:14:58.037 --> 00:14:59.803
Cubiculum 16,
for example,

00:14:59.803 --> 00:15:01.288
already in paint.
 

00:15:01.288 --> 00:15:03.740
Now we see it in built
architecture.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.436
But what we see in the eastern
part of the Empire is the way in

00:15:07.436 --> 00:15:10.655
which architects used the
traditional language of Greek

00:15:10.655 --> 00:15:12.839
architecture--
columns, pediments,

00:15:12.839 --> 00:15:16.110
lintels--and do something
entirely different with them.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:19.815
And it's very different from
built architecture in Rome,

00:15:19.815 --> 00:15:21.230
of the same period.
 

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.908
Now the building that I
recommend,

00:15:23.908 --> 00:15:25.467
if you want to work on Ephesus
-- there are other

00:15:25.467 --> 00:15:27.351
possibilities,
you could work on that Temple

00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:29.951
of Hadrian,
for example--but the one that I

00:15:29.951 --> 00:15:33.374
think has the richest
opportunities for an outstanding

00:15:33.374 --> 00:15:35.668
paper,
and an interesting paper as

00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:38.480
well, and an interesting
research adventure,

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:43.029
is the Library of Celsus in
Ephesus.

00:15:43.029 --> 00:15:46.008
You're students,
you spend a lot of time,

00:15:46.008 --> 00:15:49.508
I hope, in libraries,
and so you have a sense of

00:15:49.508 --> 00:15:53.400
Sterling and the way it works;
if you're not always online,

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.590
instead of going to the library
these days,

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:59.940
which is a temptation that even
I fall into the trap of,

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:03.462
on a fairly regular basis
but--using the Internet instead

00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:06.610
of taking that extra step to get
to the library.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.583
But I really urge you,
it's very important for this

00:16:08.583 --> 00:16:08.899
topic.
 

00:16:08.899 --> 00:16:12.491
You will not find--for these
papers, you will not find--you

00:16:12.491 --> 00:16:15.774
will find a lot of interesting
things on the Internet,

00:16:15.774 --> 00:16:18.190
and I really do urge you to use
it.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.222
But, at the same time,
you will find that you really

00:16:21.222 --> 00:16:24.851
do need to go to the library and
get out a variety of books to

00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:27.288
help you do a good job on this
paper.

00:16:27.288 --> 00:16:29.532
The Library of Celsus,
because of your general

00:16:29.532 --> 00:16:32.124
interest in libraries and
because of the fact that we

00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:34.408
haven't been able to talk,
in this course,

00:16:34.408 --> 00:16:36.330
about libraries in the ancient
world,

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.320
the most famous of which,
of course,

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.511
was the library at Alexandria,
upon which all other ancient

00:16:42.511 --> 00:16:47.163
libraries appear to have tried--
appear to have measured

00:16:47.163 --> 00:16:48.308
themselves.
 

00:16:48.308 --> 00:16:52.030
But we see lots of libraries in
Rome and around Italy and around

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.620
the Empire;
Greek and Latin libraries.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.408
Libraries that are either part
of private villas sometimes--

00:16:58.408 --> 00:17:00.908
we'll see that at Hadrian's
Villa, for example,

00:17:00.908 --> 00:17:05.180
or in fora, like Trajan's
Forum, which we'll look at on

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.048
Thursday.
 

00:17:06.048 --> 00:17:09.650
But also large enterprises that
served a city,

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:11.170
such as this one.
 

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.598
This is the Library of Celsus,
in Ephesus.

00:17:14.598 --> 00:17:18.357
It is called after Celsus,
because Celsus--a man by the

00:17:18.357 --> 00:17:21.558
name of Celsus,
C-e-l--s-u-s--was the patron of

00:17:21.558 --> 00:17:24.900
this particular library that
bears his name.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:29.132
He was the benefactor who
wanted to splash his own name on

00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:32.145
this library,
the purpose of the library

00:17:32.145 --> 00:17:35.798
being a library for everybody
who lived in Ephesus.

00:17:35.798 --> 00:17:39.077
We see a plan--these are both
from Ward-Perkins--a plan,

00:17:39.077 --> 00:17:41.700
and also a restored view,
of the interior.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.670
In the plan you see its inside.
 

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.586
It's a rectangular space with a
niche, with columns in that

00:17:46.586 --> 00:17:48.992
niche;
columns around the perimeter of

00:17:48.992 --> 00:17:50.730
the room;
and then columns,

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.259
as well as a staircase,
on the front of the structure.

00:17:54.259 --> 00:17:57.933
In this restored view you get a
better sense of what it would've

00:17:57.933 --> 00:17:59.160
looked like inside.
 

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.670
You see that niche here.
 

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:03.285
You can see now that it's a
two-storied niche,

00:18:03.285 --> 00:18:06.365
with columns on two stories,
and with a semi-dome with

00:18:06.365 --> 00:18:07.759
coffers, at the top.
 

00:18:07.759 --> 00:18:12.869
And then a series of tiers,
with rectangular storage areas

00:18:12.869 --> 00:18:16.096
here, with shelves,
where they placed

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:19.234
those--remember,
there were scrolls,

00:18:19.234 --> 00:18:20.670
not books.
 

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:24.009
So they piled the scrolls on
these shelves,

00:18:24.009 --> 00:18:27.925
and then each of these
rectangular areas had a wooden

00:18:27.925 --> 00:18:31.561
door that would cover--
would close and keep those

00:18:31.561 --> 00:18:34.980
scrolls protected,
unless someone wanted to check

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.710
them out,
or consult them, or whatever.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.868
We see it also had a flat roof
with a coffered ceiling.

00:18:41.868 --> 00:18:44.858
Now what's also very
interesting about this library,

00:18:44.858 --> 00:18:48.704
and essentially unique,
is that Celsus not only wanted

00:18:48.704 --> 00:18:51.970
to give this as a benefaction to
his city,

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:55.309
for the public good,
he decided he also wanted it to

00:18:55.309 --> 00:18:56.618
serve as his tomb.
 

00:18:56.618 --> 00:18:59.311
Now I've told you that people
made strange choices

00:18:59.311 --> 00:19:01.838
vis-à-vis their last
resting places,

00:19:01.838 --> 00:19:05.094
and Celsus decided that he
wanted to be buried in his

00:19:05.094 --> 00:19:05.720
library.
 

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.622
So he provided--beneath that
central niche there was a burial

00:19:09.622 --> 00:19:12.940
chamber, and he was indeed
buried in his library.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.611
So this is not only a library,
it's also a tomb,

00:19:15.611 --> 00:19:18.624
which again makes it a
particularly interesting topic,

00:19:18.624 --> 00:19:19.420
I believe.
 

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.669
It had fallen,
the building had fallen down,

00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:26.372
and about in the 1970s it was
still on the ground,

00:19:26.372 --> 00:19:28.108
in bits and pieces.
 

00:19:28.108 --> 00:19:31.608
In more recent decades they
have taken those pieces--

00:19:31.608 --> 00:19:34.432
there were tons of them,
hundreds and hundreds of

00:19:34.432 --> 00:19:35.891
pieces--
and the authorities,

00:19:35.891 --> 00:19:38.751
the archaeological authorities,
have put this building back

00:19:38.751 --> 00:19:39.279
together.
 

00:19:39.279 --> 00:19:42.454
But they've put it back
together with its own

00:19:42.454 --> 00:19:44.910
architectural members and so on.
 

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.900
And this is what you see today,
if you go to Ephesus.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.598
It's an extraordinary structure.
 

00:19:50.598 --> 00:19:53.180
You can see that it's entirely
made out of marble.

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.670
This is the façade of
the Library of Celsus;

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:57.390
it's entirely made out of
marble.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:00.457
We can see that it is
two-tiered, with columns

00:20:00.457 --> 00:20:04.595
supporting straight lintels,
down below, and then in the

00:20:04.595 --> 00:20:07.368
upper tier a combination of
arched--

00:20:07.368 --> 00:20:15.819
of arcuated pediments and
rectangular pediments up above,

00:20:15.819 --> 00:20:17.380
to give it some variety.
 

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.210
And you'll also see something
very interesting here,

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:23.534
which is although the architect
has used the traditional

00:20:23.534 --> 00:20:27.362
language of Greek architecture--
columns and pediments and the

00:20:27.362 --> 00:20:29.375
like,
which is very traditional,

00:20:29.375 --> 00:20:32.611
when you compare it to the
sorts of concrete buildings

00:20:32.611 --> 00:20:35.499
going up Rome--
but at the same time has

00:20:35.499 --> 00:20:38.630
injected motion into this
façade,

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:41.818
by having a series of
projecting bays,

00:20:41.818 --> 00:20:43.578
receding bays,
projecting bay,

00:20:43.578 --> 00:20:46.567
receding bay,
creating a kind of undulating

00:20:46.567 --> 00:20:49.509
in-and-out effect,
across the façade.

00:20:49.509 --> 00:20:51.990
And then has done something
quite interesting,

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:55.118
which is to place the columns
in the second tier,

00:20:55.118 --> 00:20:57.868
not immediately above those in
the lower tier,

00:20:57.868 --> 00:21:00.730
but straddling the spaces in
between them,

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.818
above the receding bays rather
than the projecting bays,

00:21:03.818 --> 00:21:08.624
which injects still more motion
into the upper part of the

00:21:08.624 --> 00:21:12.200
structure,
in contrast to the lower part.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:16.586
And you can see also the--again
marble construction here,

00:21:16.586 --> 00:21:19.799
variegated marble used for the
columns;

00:21:19.799 --> 00:21:23.259
so very much a marble building.
 

00:21:23.259 --> 00:21:27.010
And marble, very high quality
marble was more readily

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:31.555
accessible in Greece and in Asia
Minor than anywhere else in the

00:21:31.555 --> 00:21:32.710
Roman world.
 

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.480
This is another wonderful view.
 

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.512
We're standing below,
looking up from the first tier

00:21:37.512 --> 00:21:40.250
to the second tier of the
Library of Celsus.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.502
And as you look at this,
you probably are thinking:

00:21:42.502 --> 00:21:44.625
"Hey,
architectural cages at the top

00:21:44.625 --> 00:21:46.828
of Fourth Style Roman wall
painting."

00:21:46.828 --> 00:21:50.140
We've seen this before,
but only in painting.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.990
We haven't seen anything like
it.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:55.858
The closest we got is our look
at the Forum Transitorium,

00:21:55.858 --> 00:21:58.876
or the Forum of Nerva,
in Rome, where I showed you

00:21:58.876 --> 00:22:01.710
those columns that project out
of the wall,

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.434
and have projecting
entablatures,

00:22:03.434 --> 00:22:05.430
and that kind of in-and-out
effect.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.644
I said that was the first
example in Rome of what we might

00:22:08.644 --> 00:22:12.028
call the "baroque"
trend in Roman architecture,

00:22:12.028 --> 00:22:16.048
where this motion is injected
into the façade.

00:22:16.048 --> 00:22:18.990
But we see this very naturally
in Asia Minor,

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:20.460
over and over again.
 

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.598
We see it here.
 

00:22:21.598 --> 00:22:24.865
So an example of something in
built architecture that we've

00:22:24.865 --> 00:22:27.118
seen earlier in painted
architecture,

00:22:27.118 --> 00:22:29.778
and which is going to have--as
we'll see,

00:22:29.778 --> 00:22:33.099
I have an entire lecture on the
baroque architecture of Roman

00:22:33.099 --> 00:22:35.520
antiquity,
where we look at a series of

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.288
buildings around the provinces
that all make use of traditional

00:22:39.288 --> 00:22:41.982
vocabulary,
but use it in a very vibrant

00:22:41.982 --> 00:22:43.640
way, as you can see here.
 

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.563
And then there are,
as you probably already

00:22:45.563 --> 00:22:47.944
noticed, statues that are placed
in the niches on the

00:22:47.944 --> 00:22:51.009
façade;
in this case of two women.

00:22:51.009 --> 00:22:52.751
The interesting question,
for anyone working on it,

00:22:52.751 --> 00:22:53.308
who are these?
 

00:22:53.308 --> 00:22:57.161
Their names are given,
or they have inscriptions down

00:22:57.161 --> 00:22:59.680
below, identification,
in Greek.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.788
And you can also see,
with these details,

00:23:02.788 --> 00:23:04.818
how elaborate these were,
how they,

00:23:04.818 --> 00:23:07.160
just like in the shrine,
in the Temple of Hadrian,

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.684
in Ephesus, the use of
decoration covers almost every

00:23:10.684 --> 00:23:14.890
available space and helps to not
only decorate or ornament,

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:18.140
but dematerialize the
architecture elements.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:21.349
Something again we saw in
painting, Third Style Roman

00:23:21.349 --> 00:23:22.028
painting.
 

00:23:22.028 --> 00:23:23.558
Here we see it--and on the Ara
Pacis;

00:23:23.558 --> 00:23:26.042
so we have seen it in
architecture--here we see it in

00:23:26.042 --> 00:23:27.808
architecture in the Western
Empire.

00:23:27.808 --> 00:23:34.020
Another very interesting city,
and issue, is in the Roman City

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:38.910
of Gerasa, or Jerash,
in what is today Jordan.

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:43.268
I show you--we will look at a
couple of buildings in Jordan,

00:23:43.268 --> 00:23:47.108
later in the term,
but not at this particular one.

00:23:47.108 --> 00:23:51.981
I show you a plan of what the
Roman City of Jerash looked

00:23:51.981 --> 00:23:56.420
like, and where the Roman
buildings were located.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.819
You can pick out all the
obvious components of a

00:23:59.819 --> 00:24:01.048
miniature Rome.
 

00:24:01.048 --> 00:24:03.378
You see a hippodrome,
for example,

00:24:03.378 --> 00:24:05.920
over here, with its hairpin
shape.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.778
There was an Arch of Hadrian
over here.

00:24:08.778 --> 00:24:12.328
There were two theaters,
the North Theater over here,

00:24:12.328 --> 00:24:15.265
and there's another theater
somewhere there,

00:24:15.265 --> 00:24:17.450
the South Theater,
up there.

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:20.759
And you can see that they
conform to the shape of a

00:24:20.759 --> 00:24:22.348
typical Roman theater.
 

00:24:22.348 --> 00:24:26.960
You also see there was a temple
to Artemis here as well.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.930
There are a couple of
tetrapylons.

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:33.223
We haven't seen tetrapylons in
Rome, and in fact the Romans

00:24:33.223 --> 00:24:35.440
didn't build tetrapylons in the
city.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:40.169
A tetrapylon is a four-sided
arch that is made specifically

00:24:40.169 --> 00:24:44.246
to span two streets,
so that you can go through the

00:24:44.246 --> 00:24:44.980
arch.
 

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:48.055
And the arch is right over the
intersection of those two

00:24:48.055 --> 00:24:50.693
streets,
so that you can drive your

00:24:50.693 --> 00:24:54.079
cart, or walk,
right through the arch on

00:24:54.079 --> 00:24:56.848
either street,
either of the two streets.

00:24:56.848 --> 00:25:01.247
These tetrapylons were very
popular in the eastern part of

00:25:01.247 --> 00:25:02.250
the Empire.
 

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:05.073
We'll see a number--we'll see a
couple of them today,

00:25:05.073 --> 00:25:08.440
and others in the course of the
term, and you see that here.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.446
And for anybody interested,
both in Jerash and in

00:25:12.446 --> 00:25:15.828
tetrapylons,
I recommend--I'm not going over

00:25:15.828 --> 00:25:19.116
the specific references here,
but if you don't--you probably

00:25:19.116 --> 00:25:21.964
didn't bring this today,
but on the web portal you will

00:25:21.964 --> 00:25:24.980
find bibliography for each one
of these topics,

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.816
and again, as I mentioned,
most of these are on reserve

00:25:27.816 --> 00:25:28.710
for the course.
 

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:30.296
I recommend,
in particular,

00:25:30.296 --> 00:25:33.826
the book by William MacDonald,
called The Architecture of

00:25:33.826 --> 00:25:35.685
the Roman Empire,
Volume 2,

00:25:35.685 --> 00:25:38.019
in which he focuses
specifically--

00:25:38.019 --> 00:25:39.818
anyone working on one of the
cities in the East,

00:25:39.818 --> 00:25:42.732
the eastern provinces,
will find this book very

00:25:42.732 --> 00:25:43.430
valuable.
 

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:47.019
Because he, in very poetic
language,

00:25:47.019 --> 00:25:51.213
he is able to conjure up the
way in which these cities were

00:25:51.213 --> 00:25:53.183
planned,
the way in which these

00:25:53.183 --> 00:25:55.960
buildings interacted with the
streets of the city,

00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:03.673
and the kind of vistas and
visual kind of views that were

00:26:03.673 --> 00:26:11.798
carefully orchestrated by the
designers of these cities,

00:26:11.798 --> 00:26:14.548
as well as the ways in which
they wanted to move people

00:26:14.548 --> 00:26:15.670
around those cities.
 

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:19.318
I think you'll find that book
particularly valuable.

00:26:19.318 --> 00:26:22.450
Let me just go back for a
moment.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:24.598
I just want to show you that
plan one more time,

00:26:24.598 --> 00:26:29.108
because eventually I am going
to show you the Forum of Gerasa,

00:26:29.108 --> 00:26:31.210
which you see is located right
over here,

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:35.480
and the shape of that forum is
particularly interesting,

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.568
as we shall see.
 

00:26:36.568 --> 00:26:39.328
Just a couple of buildings from
Gerasa.

00:26:39.328 --> 00:26:42.540
On the left-hand side of the
screen, the Arch of Hadrian,

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.292
which you can see,
once again, stone construction

00:26:45.292 --> 00:26:49.539
here;
with large projecting columns;

00:26:49.539 --> 00:26:53.557
niches on the second story;
contrast between larger order

00:26:53.557 --> 00:26:54.710
and smaller order.
 

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:58.328
Here we again see projecting
columns with projecting

00:26:58.328 --> 00:27:02.019
entablature, but then a pediment
that is recessed.

00:27:02.019 --> 00:27:05.651
So again, this playing around
with the traditional language of

00:27:05.651 --> 00:27:08.211
architecture,
in a way the Greeks themselves

00:27:08.211 --> 00:27:09.640
would not have done.
 

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.058
Same happens up here.
 

00:27:11.058 --> 00:27:14.409
You have tall projecting
columns with a triangular

00:27:14.409 --> 00:27:17.086
pediment,
but a triangular pediment that

00:27:17.086 --> 00:27:20.058
is made up of projecting wings
on either side,

00:27:20.058 --> 00:27:27.288
and then the central part of
the pediment is placed in depth.

00:27:27.288 --> 00:27:30.838
Here a view of the fountain,
or the nymphaeum,

00:27:30.838 --> 00:27:34.602
of the city of Gerasa,
where you can see again the

00:27:34.602 --> 00:27:36.412
use--
just as the Library of

00:27:36.412 --> 00:27:39.616
Celsus--the use of columns,
in this case sets of columns

00:27:39.616 --> 00:27:41.910
that are placed one on top of
the other,

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.118
in two tiers.
 

00:27:43.118 --> 00:27:45.642
There would've been a columnar
display here,

00:27:45.642 --> 00:27:49.336
probably--certainly also in two
stories, on the interior of this

00:27:49.336 --> 00:27:50.098
building.
 

00:27:50.098 --> 00:27:54.604
Now this is the part of Gerasa
that I think is most

00:27:54.604 --> 00:27:59.380
interesting, and that is that it
has an oval forum;

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.038
an oval forum,
a forum in an oval shape.

00:28:02.038 --> 00:28:06.140
Now we've seen ovals before,
for amphitheater architecture,

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.848
the elliptical plan of an
amphitheater,

00:28:07.848 --> 00:28:10.920
but we have not seen--and we've
seen octagonal rooms,

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:15.618
and we've seen round rooms--but
we have not seen the Romans in

00:28:15.618 --> 00:28:19.779
Italy use the oval for anything
other than amphitheater

00:28:19.779 --> 00:28:21.088
architecture.
 

00:28:21.088 --> 00:28:25.479
And yet we see here this
wonderful forum in Gerasa that

00:28:25.479 --> 00:28:29.625
consists of an oval,
which is defined essentially by

00:28:29.625 --> 00:28:32.470
a series of columns on a curve.
 

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:35.865
So placing of columns,
placing of the traditional

00:28:35.865 --> 00:28:38.979
language of Greek architecture
along a curve,

00:28:38.979 --> 00:28:40.960
which we've seen before.
 

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.169
We saw that at Palestrina,
for example,

00:28:43.169 --> 00:28:45.670
but we see it here,
with this oval shape.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:47.618
And the other thing that you
see in this view,

00:28:47.618 --> 00:28:50.529
that is so interesting,
is the fact that many--

00:28:50.529 --> 00:28:54.656
most of the streets in the
cities in the eastern provinces

00:28:54.656 --> 00:28:58.311
are colonnaded streets,
are streets that have columns

00:28:58.311 --> 00:28:59.288
all along them.
 

00:28:59.288 --> 00:29:02.759
We never, ever see this in
Italy.

00:29:02.759 --> 00:29:09.019
There is no ancient Roman town
in Italy that has a colonnaded

00:29:09.019 --> 00:29:09.960
street.
 

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.755
So we begin to see these
interesting differences between

00:29:13.755 --> 00:29:15.480
Rome and the provinces.
 

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.538
Why is this?
 

00:29:16.538 --> 00:29:18.380
It's interesting to ask
ourselves why this might be.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.542
I think again it probably has
to do with the fact that there

00:29:21.542 --> 00:29:24.945
was a long tradition,
in Greece and in Asia Minor,

00:29:24.945 --> 00:29:28.952
for Greek architecture:
Greek architecture made out of

00:29:28.952 --> 00:29:31.063
stone,
using columns,

00:29:31.063 --> 00:29:32.900
for the most part.
 

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.808
And that was something that
they were used to.

00:29:35.808 --> 00:29:38.358
They liked it,
and they continued it on.

00:29:38.358 --> 00:29:40.930
But they began to do it in a
different way.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:44.762
The Greeks would never have
built an oval meeting or

00:29:44.762 --> 00:29:47.769
marketplace, but here we see the
oval.

00:29:47.769 --> 00:29:50.230
So this combination of the idea
of the oval,

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.200
probably from amphitheater
architecture,

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.730
combined with the traditional
language,

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:59.470
the traditional vocabulary,
of Greek marble architecture.

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:05.759
Another extraordinary site is
the site of Palmyra,

00:30:05.759 --> 00:30:10.636
which is
in--P-a-l-m-y-r-a--which is in

00:30:10.636 --> 00:30:12.818
modern Syria.
 

00:30:12.818 --> 00:30:17.378
And I show you a view of the
ancient remains of Palmyra,

00:30:17.378 --> 00:30:19.118
as they look today.
 

00:30:19.118 --> 00:30:21.769
And you can immediately see
that Palmyra,

00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:24.619
just like Gerasa,
has colonnaded streets.

00:30:24.619 --> 00:30:25.910
Here's the street.
 

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.000
You can see all of the columns
along it,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.144
as well as a series of large
buildings that are part of the

00:30:33.144 --> 00:30:38.380
Roman structures that were added
to the city of Palmyra,

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.329
in Roman times.
 

00:30:39.329 --> 00:30:41.130
Here's an example of one.
 

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.942
This is a stone arch at
Palmyra, and you can see that

00:30:44.942 --> 00:30:49.490
the stone arch has been made
part of that colonnaded street.

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:54.423
And the columns that lead up to
it create a very interesting

00:30:54.423 --> 00:30:56.430
vista toward the arch.
 

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:58.690
And then you can see--this is
very interesting,

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.565
we also see this quite commonly
in the eastern part of the

00:31:01.565 --> 00:31:03.565
Empire--
not only do they have columns,

00:31:03.565 --> 00:31:05.710
but they place brackets on
those columns,

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:09.983
that project out from them,
and those brackets were meant

00:31:09.983 --> 00:31:13.952
to hold honorific statuary:
so statues of some of the

00:31:13.952 --> 00:31:18.204
famous people of the city,
or magistrates or whatever,

00:31:18.204 --> 00:31:20.298
of the city of Roman Palmyra.
 

00:31:20.298 --> 00:31:24.797
I mentioned a tetrapylon,
a four-sided arch that would

00:31:24.797 --> 00:31:26.410
span two streets.
 

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:29.732
We see one of those here,
a very well-preserved

00:31:29.732 --> 00:31:31.538
tetrapylon, in Palmyra.
 

00:31:31.538 --> 00:31:34.779
And you see that once again
they've used the traditional

00:31:34.779 --> 00:31:37.548
language of architecture:
made out of stone,

00:31:37.548 --> 00:31:40.200
with columns supporting
straight lintels,

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.588
that serve--and placed on stone
bases,

00:31:43.588 --> 00:31:48.086
as you can see here--that serve
as the four sides of that

00:31:48.086 --> 00:31:49.130
tetrapylon.
 

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:51.240
There would've been some roof
on top of this,

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.779
of some sort;
or maybe not,

00:31:52.779 --> 00:31:55.180
I've forgotten whether that was
the--

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.385
I've forgotten what people
think about this particular

00:31:57.385 --> 00:31:59.578
arch,
whether there was--some of them

00:31:59.578 --> 00:32:01.740
have roofs and some of them do
not.

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.640
I don't actually recall what
the case is with this one.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.364
But it gives you again a very
good idea of this tetrapylon

00:32:08.364 --> 00:32:12.348
arch that was so popular in the
eastern part of the Empire.

00:32:12.348 --> 00:32:14.509
But the building again in
Palmyra,

00:32:14.509 --> 00:32:17.318
that I think is by far the most
intriguing,

00:32:17.318 --> 00:32:21.368
and makes a perfect paper
topic--because one can try to

00:32:21.368 --> 00:32:26.095
decode which aspects of this are
Roman and which aspects of this

00:32:26.095 --> 00:32:28.855
are local,
and that's essentially the name

00:32:28.855 --> 00:32:31.765
of the game when you try--
when you go out into the Roman

00:32:31.765 --> 00:32:34.650
provinces,
to try to determine what it is;

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:38.806
in what ways has what's going
on in the capital had impact on

00:32:38.806 --> 00:32:41.368
what's happening in the
provinces,

00:32:41.368 --> 00:32:46.186
and what local traditions are
so strong that they continue to

00:32:46.186 --> 00:32:48.074
exist,
and even resurface,

00:32:48.074 --> 00:32:49.788
in some of these buildings?
 

00:32:49.788 --> 00:32:52.038
It's usually a coming together
of both of those elements--

00:32:52.038 --> 00:32:54.380
elements from Rome and local
elements--

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:58.346
and the way in which those
co-exist and end up creating an

00:32:58.346 --> 00:33:01.548
entirely different architectural
phenomenon;

00:33:01.548 --> 00:33:03.740
which is what we see in this
building here.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:08.554
This is called the Temple of
Bel, B-e-l, at Palmyra,

00:33:08.554 --> 00:33:10.818
again in modern Syria.
 

00:33:10.818 --> 00:33:13.750
And you say to yourself,
"Well who is Bel?"

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:16.714
Well Bel is a god,
and that tells you something

00:33:16.714 --> 00:33:17.359
already.
 

00:33:17.359 --> 00:33:19.200
Bel is a local god.
 

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.403
So this is not a temple to
Jupiter or to Jupiter,

00:33:22.403 --> 00:33:23.740
Juno, and Minerva.
 

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:24.910
This is a temple to Bel.
 

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:28.130
So that already tells us
something about this structure,

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:31.470
as it goes up in Rome,
that they are--

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:33.848
as it goes up in Palmyra,
during Roman times,

00:33:33.848 --> 00:33:37.830
that they are interested in
commemorating and honoring a

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:38.700
local god.
 

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.590
If we look at the plan--and
maybe you can help me here with

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:43.699
this--
if we look at the plan,

00:33:43.699 --> 00:33:47.640
and we think back to what we
know of typical Greek,

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.700
Etruscan, and Roman temple
architecture,

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.319
we should be struck by this
plan.

00:33:52.319 --> 00:33:53.400
What is it that strikes us?
 

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.740
What elements strike us about
this particular plan?

00:33:59.839 --> 00:34:01.568
Anyone? Yes?
 

00:34:01.568 --> 00:34:04.798
Student:  The porch goes
all the way around.

00:34:04.798 --> 00:34:12.510
Prof: The porch,
the staircase?

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:14.389
The podium you mean?
 

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.710
The podium.
 

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:15.559
Student:  The podium.
 

00:34:15.559 --> 00:34:16.400
Prof: The podium.
 

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.369
The podium goes all the way
around,

00:34:18.369 --> 00:34:23.860
and the columns go all the way
around,

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:27.030
and--you can see in this
restored view--

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:30.219
the staircase goes all the way
around.

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:32.471
So the podium,
the staircase and the

00:34:32.471 --> 00:34:36.523
columns--which are freestanding,
as you can see here--go all the

00:34:36.523 --> 00:34:37.489
way around.
 

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:40.021
So that is characteristic of
what kind of temple

00:34:40.021 --> 00:34:40.829
architecture?
 

00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:45.119
Greek: Greek temple
architecture.

00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:48.889
However, what else do we see
that's curious?

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:52.559
This is not entirely a Greek
temple type, it's--yes?

00:34:52.559 --> 00:34:55.061
Student:  The side
entrance into the

00:34:55.061 --> 00:34:56.670
&gt;
 

00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:57.179
Prof: The cella.
 

00:34:57.179 --> 00:34:58.079
Student:  The cella.
 

00:34:58.079 --> 00:34:59.409
Prof: The cella is here.
 

00:34:59.409 --> 00:35:00.409
We have a single cella.
 

00:35:00.409 --> 00:35:04.496
We have a staircase,
an additional staircase,

00:35:04.496 --> 00:35:08.117
on one side,
which leads into the cella,

00:35:08.117 --> 00:35:10.753
from the side;
not from the end,

00:35:10.753 --> 00:35:11.829
as we usually see.
 

00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:15.146
You usually enter from one end,
one short end,

00:35:15.146 --> 00:35:18.833
and you have the apse,
or the place where the god's

00:35:18.833 --> 00:35:21.710
statue was kept,
on the other side.

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:24.980
But here we see a staircase
that's placed in the center--

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.219
and it isn't even quite in the
center,

00:35:26.219 --> 00:35:29.311
it's actually slightly
off-center--on one of the long

00:35:29.311 --> 00:35:32.829
sides of the temple,
which we have never seen before.

00:35:32.829 --> 00:35:37.510
So we have this interesting
location of the other staircase,

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:41.469
but also this combination of a
staircase that goes all the way

00:35:41.469 --> 00:35:43.251
around,
in the Greek manner,

00:35:43.251 --> 00:35:45.909
but then a kind of
façade-orientation,

00:35:45.909 --> 00:35:50.018
by the placement of an
additional staircase on one side

00:35:50.018 --> 00:35:51.389
of the monument.
 

00:35:51.389 --> 00:35:54.079
So a very schizophrenic
building, in that regard.

00:35:54.079 --> 00:35:55.739
And the list goes on and on.
 

00:35:55.739 --> 00:35:57.610
Let's look at the restored view.
 

00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:00.159
What do we see here that's
curious?

00:36:00.159 --> 00:36:07.989
Anyone?
 

00:36:07.989 --> 00:36:10.969
We have tall columns,
with capitals.

00:36:10.969 --> 00:36:13.179
Look at the doorway.
 

00:36:13.179 --> 00:36:14.070
Can you see?
 

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:16.920
I don't know how clear it is to
you, from where you sit.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.349
What's happening above the
doorway?

00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:23.007
We have additional--we have the
upper part of the column and the

00:36:23.007 --> 00:36:26.780
capital, truncated,
placed on top of the doorway.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:27.309
That's strange.
 

00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:29.510
How are we meant to read that
exactly?

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:30.750
We've never seen that before.
 

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:31.679
And look at the top.
 

00:36:31.679 --> 00:36:35.130
We have crenulations on the top
of the monument.

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:39.289
And at the very top we have
some kind of a deck up there,

00:36:39.289 --> 00:36:43.597
that may have been used for
something having to do with the

00:36:43.597 --> 00:36:45.010
worship of Bel.
 

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:49.490
So one asks--so we see this
interesting combination of the

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:52.478
influence of Greek temple
architecture,

00:36:52.478 --> 00:36:56.409
Roman temple architecture,
and local practice.

00:36:56.409 --> 00:36:57.929
And so one would want to ask
oneself,

00:36:57.929 --> 00:37:00.230
or one would try to find out
what one could,

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:02.717
about the worship of Bel,
and about whether there were

00:37:02.717 --> 00:37:06.054
any earlier temples of Bel here,
and whether any of these

00:37:06.054 --> 00:37:08.949
features have to do with local
practice.

00:37:08.949 --> 00:37:11.416
The building still stands,
or part of it,

00:37:11.416 --> 00:37:13.018
and you can see it here.
 

00:37:13.018 --> 00:37:16.110
Here you see that doorway that
we were looking at just before,

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:19.487
some of the columns,
and you can see the kind of

00:37:19.487 --> 00:37:24.005
very nice honey-colored stone,
out of which the Temple of Bel

00:37:24.005 --> 00:37:24.719
was made.
 

00:37:24.719 --> 00:37:29.275
Another terrific topic--and for
anybody who lives on the West

00:37:29.275 --> 00:37:33.150
Coast and is going home to the
LA area for break.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:36.460
You probably have already been
to the Getty Museum.

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:37.880
You can go again.
 

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.503
But if you have never been,
it's an extraordinary--this

00:37:40.503 --> 00:37:42.059
would be a perfect time to go.
 

00:37:42.059 --> 00:37:45.440
The Villa of the Papyri in
Herculaneum,

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.961
a villa comparable to some of
the villas that we've looked at

00:37:48.961 --> 00:37:51.858
this semester,
whether it's Boscotrecase,

00:37:51.858 --> 00:37:56.222
or the Villa Jovis on Capri,
a very important villa in

00:37:56.222 --> 00:38:00.480
Campania,
of the early Roman period.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:04.971
The Villa of the Papyri is
so-called because of papyrus

00:38:04.971 --> 00:38:07.800
fragments that were found there.
 

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:11.155
The owner of this particular
villa had his own library--we're

00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:12.610
back to libraries again.
 

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:14.960
And by the way,
on the bibliography,

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.659
there's a particularly good
book by Lionel Casson,

00:38:18.659 --> 00:38:22.239
C-a-s-s-o-n,
on the libraries of the ancient

00:38:22.239 --> 00:38:24.472
world,
that anybody who works either

00:38:24.472 --> 00:38:27.389
on Ephesus or this will probably
want to take a look at.

00:38:27.389 --> 00:38:31.510
He has his own library here,
and there were scrolls from

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:34.010
that library,
especially from one specific

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.945
author,
that were found there,

00:38:35.945 --> 00:38:39.938
and it is because of those
papyrus fragments that the villa

00:38:39.938 --> 00:38:42.873
got its name,
the Villa of the Papyri,

00:38:42.873 --> 00:38:44.050
in Herculaneum.
 

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:49.536
The excavations--excavations
were done some time ago of this

00:38:49.536 --> 00:38:50.280
villa.
 

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.239
A plan was drawn of the villa
at that particular time,

00:38:54.239 --> 00:38:58.059
but the excavators found that
noxious gasses were starting to

00:38:58.059 --> 00:39:01.715
be emitted from the ground,
and there was a great--it was a

00:39:01.715 --> 00:39:02.559
health hazard.
 

00:39:02.559 --> 00:39:05.565
And so after they unearthed it,
after they drew it,

00:39:05.565 --> 00:39:07.610
they covered it back over
again.

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:10.833
And it's only been in very
recent years that excavation has

00:39:10.833 --> 00:39:12.280
again begun on the site.
 

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.577
And I show you a couple of
views of the excavation that is

00:39:15.577 --> 00:39:18.519
currently underway,
that is once again revealing

00:39:18.519 --> 00:39:21.976
some of the original walls,
as well as some of the stucco

00:39:21.976 --> 00:39:24.179
and paintings of the original
villa.

00:39:24.179 --> 00:39:26.030
Now what's particularly
interesting,

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.139
and where the Getty Museum
comes in,

00:39:28.139 --> 00:39:31.532
is John Paul Getty,
when he designed his villa at

00:39:31.532 --> 00:39:32.838
Malibu--
which serves,

00:39:32.838 --> 00:39:34.679
of course, as a museum of
antiquities--

00:39:34.679 --> 00:39:38.532
when he was building that,
he used the Villa of the Papyri

00:39:38.532 --> 00:39:41.529
as a model,
and I mean as an exact model,

00:39:41.529 --> 00:39:45.202
he really duplicated quite
precisely the Villa of the

00:39:45.202 --> 00:39:45.909
Papyri.
 

00:39:45.909 --> 00:39:48.286
This is the plan of the Villa
of the Papyri,

00:39:48.286 --> 00:39:50.385
as it was drawn,
when it was originally

00:39:50.385 --> 00:39:51.159
excavated.
 

00:39:51.159 --> 00:39:54.268
And you can see--I guess of the
structures we looked at,

00:39:54.268 --> 00:39:57.690
it's probably most like the
House of Loreius Tibertinus,

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:00.786
where you'll remember there's a
small amount of space given to

00:40:00.786 --> 00:40:04.514
the house on two stories,
and most of it given to a large

00:40:04.514 --> 00:40:05.110
garden.
 

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:07.570
We see the same idea here,
where we have--

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:09.909
and you can see it better over
here--

00:40:09.909 --> 00:40:12.780
where we have one area around a
court,

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.320
that has living spaces on the
second story,

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.260
and then the rest of the villa
is taken up,

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:20.610
in this case,
by a huge, hugely long pool,

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:24.059
that has statuary and the like
around it.

00:40:24.059 --> 00:40:28.221
Now John Paul Getty decided
again to use this Villa of

00:40:28.221 --> 00:40:31.518
Papyri as the model for the
Getty Villa.

00:40:31.518 --> 00:40:34.657
And this is actually the Getty
Villa that you're looking at

00:40:34.657 --> 00:40:37.255
here, from the air:
a painting of the Getty Villa

00:40:37.255 --> 00:40:39.150
that you see from the air here.
 

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:42.380
And you can see that it is
almost exactly the same,

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:45.289
in plan, as the actual Villa of
the Papyri.

00:40:45.289 --> 00:40:48.510
So going to the Getty
Villa--and this is,

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:51.760
of course, a view of that long
pool at the Getty Villa--

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.269
going to the Getty Villa is
like going back in time,

00:40:54.269 --> 00:40:56.130
to the Villa of the Papyri.
 

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:59.362
And I know a lot of people
think this is sort of Disneyland

00:40:59.362 --> 00:41:01.760
in Malibu, a Roman version of
Disneyland.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.309
Yes, to a certain extent.
 

00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:07.960
But the truth of the matter is
you will get a better sense of

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.143
what a Roman villa looked like,
in Roman antiquity,

00:41:11.143 --> 00:41:14.543
from going and looking at the
Getty Villa than you will get

00:41:14.543 --> 00:41:17.710
from going and looking at the
Villa of the Mysteries at

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:19.989
Pompeii --
only because they have

00:41:19.989 --> 00:41:23.873
restored, and because it is in
such good condition and because

00:41:23.873 --> 00:41:27.121
they have added to it--
the kind of plants that would

00:41:27.121 --> 00:41:28.329
have been used there.
 

00:41:28.329 --> 00:41:30.539
The paintings are in good shape.
 

00:41:30.539 --> 00:41:33.186
They've placed statuary,
actual copies of the ancient

00:41:33.186 --> 00:41:36.190
statuary that would have been at
the Villa of the Papyri;

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:39.621
because hundreds of statues
from the Villa of the Papyri

00:41:39.621 --> 00:41:42.429
have survived,
and they have--you can see them

00:41:42.429 --> 00:41:43.739
all at the Getty.
 

00:41:43.739 --> 00:41:45.726
I'm going to show you a few
views of this,

00:41:45.726 --> 00:41:48.099
because I think it's such an
interesting topic.

00:41:48.099 --> 00:41:51.172
I think one could write a very
interesting paper on the

00:41:51.172 --> 00:41:53.791
original villa,
as seen through the eyes of the

00:41:53.791 --> 00:41:54.760
Getty Museum.
 

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.271
For those of you who have
either been there,

00:41:57.271 --> 00:42:00.949
or have not been--or have never
been there, just a few views.

00:42:00.949 --> 00:42:03.489
The entranceway into the villa
today;

00:42:03.489 --> 00:42:05.849
one of the ramps.
 

00:42:05.849 --> 00:42:08.032
They have just--if you saw this
a few years ago and haven't been

00:42:08.032 --> 00:42:09.871
back,
they have made some additions

00:42:09.871 --> 00:42:14.061
in the last several years,
including their version of a

00:42:14.061 --> 00:42:16.501
theater--
and you can see it here--an

00:42:16.501 --> 00:42:18.487
ancient theater,
which you can see here,

00:42:18.487 --> 00:42:20.659
with the cavea and with
the cunei,

00:42:20.659 --> 00:42:22.159
or wedge-shaped sections of
seats.

00:42:22.159 --> 00:42:24.119
Two very good restaurants,
up above.

00:42:24.119 --> 00:42:27.045
And then this is a view,
standing up on the top of the

00:42:27.045 --> 00:42:29.224
cavea,
looking down toward the

00:42:29.224 --> 00:42:31.420
orchestra, toward the stage
building,

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:33.809
which is of course part of the
Getty Villa itself.

00:42:33.809 --> 00:42:37.768
And you see also that it's very
accurate--

00:42:37.768 --> 00:42:41.469
it looks a little too new--but
it's very accurate,

00:42:41.469 --> 00:42:45.195
in that they have even used
here the typical columns with

00:42:45.195 --> 00:42:47.590
the white top and the red
bottom,

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:52.190
that we saw so characteristic
of architecture in Pompeii,

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:54.329
and also in Herculaneum.
 

00:42:54.329 --> 00:42:58.268
A view of another pool,
with some famous copies of some

00:42:58.268 --> 00:43:01.260
famous bronze dancers from
Herculaneum;

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.179
I'll show you the originals in
a moment.

00:43:03.179 --> 00:43:07.126
This is the Getty's version of
First Style Roman wall painting,

00:43:07.126 --> 00:43:09.610
along the walls,
as you can see here.

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:12.958
It's not quite the same,
but nonetheless it conjures up

00:43:12.958 --> 00:43:16.804
what one of these walls would've
looked like, if you had it all

00:43:16.804 --> 00:43:18.789
the way along your corridor.
 

00:43:18.789 --> 00:43:21.909
And they have Second Style
Roman wall painting as well,

00:43:21.909 --> 00:43:24.710
and these of course based--they
looked mostly at the villa,

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:26.619
but when it came to the
paintings, they certainly used

00:43:26.619 --> 00:43:27.159
other models.
 

00:43:27.159 --> 00:43:29.318
And if you walk around the
villa you'll able to say:

00:43:29.318 --> 00:43:31.179
"Oh yes,
that comes from the--".

00:43:31.179 --> 00:43:35.773
This is a very Ara Pacis like
motif, with the garland and the

00:43:35.773 --> 00:43:39.983
columns and so on here -- so
Second Style wall painting,

00:43:39.983 --> 00:43:42.280
in these particular cases.
 

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.559
Here's another example of
Second Style wall painting at

00:43:44.559 --> 00:43:46.824
the Getty,
where they have wonderfully

00:43:46.824 --> 00:43:49.809
incorporated the door and two of
the windows,

00:43:49.809 --> 00:43:53.179
into this Second Style scheme,
as you can see here.

00:43:53.179 --> 00:43:56.789
And here we're dealing with an
atrium,

00:43:56.789 --> 00:43:59.590
in the Getty Museum,
which is based,

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:03.032
I think, on a building that I'm
sure you all know and learned

00:44:03.032 --> 00:44:06.219
for the exam,
which is which house,

00:44:06.219 --> 00:44:09.139
the atrium of which house?
 

00:44:09.139 --> 00:44:10.159
Which?
 

00:44:10.159 --> 00:44:11.420
Student:  The Vettii.
 

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:13.190
Prof: Vettii,
do you think Vettii?

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:15.820
What about this second story up
here?

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:16.530
Student:  Samnite.
 

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:18.652
Prof: Samnite, Samnite;
the Samnite House,

00:44:18.652 --> 00:44:22.110
with its second story in the
loggia, and then with its

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:25.110
impluvium and its
compluvium.

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:27.650
This is really good stuff.
 

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:30.427
And then here,
here you see a view of one of

00:44:30.427 --> 00:44:33.268
the pools, looking back through
the doors.

00:44:33.268 --> 00:44:35.179
They would've had the wooden
door jambs.

00:44:35.179 --> 00:44:37.159
We saw those in Herculaneum,
preserved.

00:44:37.159 --> 00:44:38.579
Through that,
to the pool,

00:44:38.579 --> 00:44:40.000
with the dancing women.
 

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.900
And then at the very end you
see a fountain that is based

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:46.061
exactly on the large fountain--I
showed it to you earlier this

00:44:46.061 --> 00:44:47.150
term--at Pompeii.
 

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:49.659
And here this whole concept of
vista,

00:44:49.659 --> 00:44:52.199
panorama, from one part of the
house to another,

00:44:52.199 --> 00:44:54.733
taking advantage of light
streaming through the

00:44:54.733 --> 00:44:56.818
compluvium,
onto the pool,

00:44:56.818 --> 00:44:59.210
reflections in that pool,
statuary.

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:02.603
This really conjures up,
as I said, better than anything

00:45:02.603 --> 00:45:05.195
I can show you,
what an ancient Roman villa

00:45:05.195 --> 00:45:06.739
actually looked like.
 

00:45:06.739 --> 00:45:08.739
There are rooms like this at
the Getty,

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:11.804
with marble incrustation,
that is very much like both

00:45:11.804 --> 00:45:15.487
marble incrustation we've seen,
and also like First Style Roman

00:45:15.487 --> 00:45:16.300
wall painting.
 

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:20.086
Areas like this,
where you can see again columns

00:45:20.086 --> 00:45:24.518
surrounding a garden,
with rooms on the second story;

00:45:24.518 --> 00:45:26.860
paintings, First Style
paintings on the wall;

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:29.110
statuary in the center.
 

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:31.210
And all of this,
again, based on the actual

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:34.262
statuary that was found;
a great--a huge collection of

00:45:34.262 --> 00:45:36.739
statues that this particular
owner had,

00:45:36.739 --> 00:45:40.409
that are now on view in the
Archaeological Museum in Naples,

00:45:40.409 --> 00:45:42.250
were copied for this here.
 

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:45.260
And then just another view
showing that they too,

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:48.452
at the Getty Villa at Malibu,
were very cognizant of the

00:45:48.452 --> 00:45:51.413
siting of the structure,
placing it on a cliff,

00:45:51.413 --> 00:45:54.581
so that you can have a
beautiful panorama down from

00:45:54.581 --> 00:45:58.318
there: very much in line with
the way the Romans sited their

00:45:58.318 --> 00:45:59.268
buildings.
 

00:45:59.268 --> 00:46:02.009
And then just quickly,
just to give you a sense of how

00:46:02.009 --> 00:46:04.489
compelling some of the sculpture
is from here.

00:46:04.489 --> 00:46:05.449
These are the originals.
 

00:46:05.449 --> 00:46:10.702
This is the head of an original
athlete or gladiatorial figure

00:46:10.702 --> 00:46:12.340
from Herculaneum.
 

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:14.777
You can see how vivid it is,
especially--it's done in

00:46:14.777 --> 00:46:17.730
bronze--but especially with the
inlaid eyes, that were customary

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:19.090
for statues of this type.
 

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:22.820
This has got to be the best
hair in Roman Art.

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:23.949
I love this one.
 

00:46:23.949 --> 00:46:28.954
It's a fantastically dramatic
photo of this particular head

00:46:28.954 --> 00:46:33.010
that also comes from the Villa
of the Papyri.

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:34.250
And here are dancing ladies.
 

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:38.246
These are the original versions
of the dancing women that would

00:46:38.246 --> 00:46:42.179
have surrounded a pool in the
actual villa at Herculaneum,

00:46:42.179 --> 00:46:46.570
extremely well preserved,
and in every possible posture,

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:47.530
as you can see here.
 

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:50.679
If villa architecture is your
thing,

00:46:50.679 --> 00:46:54.670
but you're not interested in
the Getty or in Herculaneum,

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:58.559
but are an Anglophile and want
to do something in England,

00:46:58.559 --> 00:47:00.510
I've got two topics,
two British topics.

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:02.349
We're not going to look at
Roman Art in Britain.

00:47:02.349 --> 00:47:05.235
So for any of you who are
particularly interested in art

00:47:05.235 --> 00:47:07.909
in the British Isles,
this might be a good topic for

00:47:07.909 --> 00:47:08.329
you.
 

00:47:08.329 --> 00:47:11.000
I have both a villa and a bath.
 

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.119
This is the Roman Villa at
Fishbourne, in Sussex,

00:47:14.119 --> 00:47:14.768
England.
 

00:47:14.768 --> 00:47:17.670
It's a model of what that villa
would've looked like.

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:20.876
And you can see that it has a
lot in common with the Templum

00:47:20.876 --> 00:47:23.172
Pacis in Rome,
with its great rectangular

00:47:23.172 --> 00:47:26.079
space and one of the buildings
pushed back against it.

00:47:26.079 --> 00:47:28.469
But one of the questions one
would ask for this,

00:47:28.469 --> 00:47:31.722
as for any buildings that were
done somewhere other than Rome:

00:47:31.722 --> 00:47:34.425
What is based,
and how close is this to what's

00:47:34.425 --> 00:47:36.570
going on in Rome,
contemporaneously?

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:37.750
And what is different?
 

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:39.170
What has to do with local
practice?

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:43.815
If one visits the Fishbourne
Villa today, you can still see

00:47:43.815 --> 00:47:47.739
the mosaic floors that are well
preserved here.

00:47:47.739 --> 00:47:50.809
And you can also--here's a
detail of one of them,

00:47:50.809 --> 00:47:55.610
which is touted as the oldest
to be seen,

00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:58.079
the earliest to be seen
anywhere in Britain,

00:47:58.079 --> 00:47:59.510
as you can see from the label.
 

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:02.710
And you can even see at the
Fishbourne Villa,

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:04.675
for example,
a private bath,

00:48:04.675 --> 00:48:06.349
with the hypocaust.
 

00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:09.179
So clearly the impact of Rome
is clear here.

00:48:09.179 --> 00:48:13.514
And they even have such
elements preserved as these roof

00:48:13.514 --> 00:48:17.768
tiles that you can see here,
on the right-hand side.

00:48:17.768 --> 00:48:22.402
Another British topic is the
Roman Bath at Bath,

00:48:22.402 --> 00:48:24.766
Aquae Sulis,
now in Avon,

00:48:24.766 --> 00:48:25.949
England.
 

00:48:25.949 --> 00:48:29.056
This is a view of the
magnificent city of Bath itself,

00:48:29.056 --> 00:48:30.230
as it looks today.
 

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:34.893
And here's a view of part of
what is preserved of the Roman

00:48:34.893 --> 00:48:37.914
Bath at Bath;
the water as green as the

00:48:37.914 --> 00:48:40.530
Tiber, as you can see in this
view.

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:43.840
But this is part of the bath
structure,

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.940
and again what one would ask
oneself is--

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:47.518
and there are,
there's enough there,

00:48:47.518 --> 00:48:51.050
that plans of what this bath
would've looked like exist--

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:53.639
and one would ask oneself,
"What is this--

00:48:53.639 --> 00:48:57.300
how does this compare to baths
that we saw in Italy?

00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:01.190
What is it--how does it compare
to the bath at Pompeii,

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:05.295
the Forum Baths or the Stabian
Baths, to the imperial bath

00:49:05.295 --> 00:49:07.170
architecture of Titus?
 

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:08.449
Are there similar kinds of
rooms?

00:49:08.449 --> 00:49:11.059
What is the construction
technique?

00:49:11.059 --> 00:49:12.050
Who was this used for?
 

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:13.250
Who did this belong to?
 

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:14.210
Who put this up?
 

00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:18.188
And what part did it play in
the social and cultural

00:49:18.188 --> 00:49:23.179
environment of the city of Aquae
Sulis in ancient Roman times?

00:49:23.179 --> 00:49:26.018
Another view of that,
where you can see some of the

00:49:26.018 --> 00:49:27.210
stone construction.
 

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:31.342
And then, once again,
a very well-preserved hypocaust

00:49:31.342 --> 00:49:35.239
at the bath at Bath,
as well as a very interesting

00:49:35.239 --> 00:49:38.260
brick arch, that you can see
here.

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:39.789
So the whole question of
technology.

00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:43.351
What kind of technology is used
in buildings like this is an

00:49:43.351 --> 00:49:44.679
intriguing question.
 

00:49:44.679 --> 00:49:48.159
Another great topic,
if you want to make your way to

00:49:48.159 --> 00:49:50.139
the Middle East,
to Masada.

00:49:50.139 --> 00:49:52.530
This is the famous cliff at
Masada.

00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:54.340
I don't know how many of you
have climbed.

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:55.969
How many of you have climbed
Masada?

00:49:55.969 --> 00:49:56.800
Anyone climbed Masada?
 

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.480
A couple of you.
 

00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.670
Did you go on the Snake Path?
 

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:00.650
Students:  Yes.
 

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:03.561
Prof: See you're so--I
didn't go on the--and I was

00:50:03.561 --> 00:50:04.809
there a long time ago.
 

00:50:04.809 --> 00:50:07.409
So I should've gone on the
Snake Path, but I didn't.

00:50:07.409 --> 00:50:08.590
I went on the cable car.
 

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:11.152
So here--this is what you do
when you go and you take the

00:50:11.152 --> 00:50:11.840
easy way out.
 

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.179
You take the cable car up.
 

00:50:13.179 --> 00:50:15.637
But you can get some good
pictures of other cable cars,

00:50:15.637 --> 00:50:17.960
as well as of the mountain,
as you make your way.

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:21.721
But the thing to do is
definitely to take the Snake

00:50:21.721 --> 00:50:26.233
Path up to the top of the peak
of Masada, which is steeped in

00:50:26.233 --> 00:50:28.039
history, as we know.
 

00:50:28.039 --> 00:50:32.922
The particular aspect that
would be at issue here would be

00:50:32.922 --> 00:50:36.800
to look at the Herod's Palace,
the great Herod,

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:40.606
about whom much is known --
a very interesting historical

00:50:40.606 --> 00:50:42.860
character,
who was around in the first

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:45.260
century B.C.,
the time of Julius Caesar and

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:46.420
Cleopatra and so on.
 

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:49.364
His palace at Masada,
which was built on the top of

00:50:49.364 --> 00:50:51.719
the peak, is particularly
interesting.

00:50:51.719 --> 00:50:54.119
Given its date,
it's roughly contemporary to

00:50:54.119 --> 00:50:56.800
the sorts of things we saw going
on in Italy,

00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:02.800
at Palestrina,
and at Tivoli the placement

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.418
of--
well in that case,

00:51:04.418 --> 00:51:06.309
the pouring of concrete on a
tiered hillside;

00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:10.539
in this case use of different
materials, as you can see here.

00:51:10.539 --> 00:51:15.108
But two views of what the
Palace of Herod on Masada would

00:51:15.108 --> 00:51:16.659
have looked like.
 

00:51:16.659 --> 00:51:20.061
Again, a tiered structure,
multi-tiered structure,

00:51:20.061 --> 00:51:21.590
roughly three tiers.
 

00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:24.789
So the question here is,
what did he have in mind?

00:51:24.789 --> 00:51:25.710
Why did he put it here?
 

00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:28.996
Why did he choose to represent
it as a kind of cascading

00:51:28.996 --> 00:51:30.909
structure, from top to bottom?
 

00:51:30.909 --> 00:51:33.269
How does it compare to
Palestrina and Tivoli?

00:51:33.269 --> 00:51:36.561
What is it made of;
is it made of concrete or is it

00:51:36.561 --> 00:51:37.530
made of something else?
 

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:39.639
And why in each instance?
 

00:51:39.639 --> 00:51:42.617
What kind of architectural
elements are used in this

00:51:42.617 --> 00:51:43.670
particular case?
 

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:45.518
And if I show you a couple of
details,

00:51:45.518 --> 00:51:47.440
you will see that Rome is not
too far away,

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:50.963
in the sense that once again we
see a hypocaust system being

00:51:50.963 --> 00:51:53.949
used to heat the floor of this
particular room,

00:51:53.949 --> 00:51:54.929
in Herod's Palace.
 

00:51:54.929 --> 00:51:56.469
Was this a bath or was this
something else?

00:51:56.469 --> 00:52:01.081
Remember, we saw the hypocaust
also used to heat the floor of

00:52:01.081 --> 00:52:03.927
Domitian's dining room,
in his palace,

00:52:03.927 --> 00:52:04.849
in Rome.
 

00:52:04.849 --> 00:52:07.552
And then over here,
look--wall painting:

00:52:07.552 --> 00:52:12.059
very similar to what we see in
Italy, at roughly the same time.

00:52:12.059 --> 00:52:14.985
This is again B.C.,
so we're talking about First

00:52:14.985 --> 00:52:18.159
and especially Second Style
Roman wall painting,

00:52:18.159 --> 00:52:21.159
or the transition between First
and Second Style Roman wall

00:52:21.159 --> 00:52:21.730
painting.
 

00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:25.269
Tombs, we've seen tombs are
particularly interesting as a

00:52:25.269 --> 00:52:27.217
topic,
because they're so varied,

00:52:27.217 --> 00:52:30.027
and have so much to do with the
particular patrons who

00:52:30.027 --> 00:52:31.139
commissioned them.
 

00:52:31.139 --> 00:52:34.789
I showed you fleetingly the two
tomb streets at Pompeii,

00:52:34.789 --> 00:52:37.730
the Via dei Sepolcri and the
Via Nucera,

00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:41.179
and I told you that we would
concentrate instead on tombs in

00:52:41.179 --> 00:52:41.590
Rome.
 

00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:44.260
But they make a very
interesting paper topic,

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.909
for someone who'd like to think
further about Pompeii,

00:52:46.909 --> 00:52:50.820
and to think about the variety
of tomb architecture in Pompeii.

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:54.090
That varies from house--tombs
that look like houses,

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:56.929
to tombs that have columns in
the second story,

00:52:56.929 --> 00:52:59.599
with statues interspersed among
them,

00:52:59.599 --> 00:53:04.599
to tombs that again have a
niche in the center,

00:53:04.599 --> 00:53:06.750
with statuary--unfortunately
headless here--

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:09.530
but preserved inscriptions.
 

00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:11.969
So if you want to get into who
these people were,

00:53:11.969 --> 00:53:14.460
what we know about them,
a kind of cultural study,

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:15.579
you could do that.
 

00:53:15.579 --> 00:53:18.710
And this is my favorite tomb on
the Via Nucera in Pompeii,

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:21.643
because it should remind you of
something we saw earlier when we

00:53:21.643 --> 00:53:23.320
looked at Roman tomb
architecture.

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:24.429
What was that?
 

00:53:24.429 --> 00:53:25.159
Student:  Columbarium.
 

00:53:25.159 --> 00:53:27.240
Prof: The columbarium,
the columbarium,

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.119
the Vigna Codini.
 

00:53:28.119 --> 00:53:32.760
But you'll remember that scheme
of placing niches on a wall was

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:36.130
for subterranean tomb
architecture in Rome.

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:38.929
And here we see--it's just a
great idea.

00:53:38.929 --> 00:53:42.012
They took the idea of the
columbarium and they slapped it

00:53:42.012 --> 00:53:44.599
on the front,
on the façade of a tomb.

00:53:44.599 --> 00:53:46.909
So you see two tiers here of
niches.

00:53:46.909 --> 00:53:50.402
Same kind of portraits that we
saw, or urns that we saw,

00:53:50.402 --> 00:53:53.260
in the Vigna Codini
columbarium, brought above

00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:53.960
ground.
 

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:56.768
Same kind of inscriptions in
front of each of them,

00:53:56.768 --> 00:53:58.590
and made into the
façade,

00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:01.269
this very interesting
façade of a tomb,

00:54:01.269 --> 00:54:04.300
on the Via Nucera in Pompeii.
 

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:07.690
Residential architecture in the
Roman provinces.

00:54:07.690 --> 00:54:13.340
The houses in France at a place
called Vaison-la-Romaine;

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:15.639
Vasio Vocontiorum in antiquity.
 

00:54:15.639 --> 00:54:22.369
The French tout this as the
French Pompeii.

00:54:22.369 --> 00:54:25.157
It is far from the French
Pompeii, unfortunately,

00:54:25.157 --> 00:54:28.409
because it doesn't have all of
those public buildings.

00:54:28.409 --> 00:54:32.306
It doesn't have an amphitheater
or a theater or an odeon or a so

00:54:32.306 --> 00:54:33.420
on and so forth.
 

00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:35.440
But it does have some
interesting houses.

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:38.280
The houses are not as well
preserved as those in Pompeii.

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:40.130
But it's interesting to look at
them.

00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:43.635
This is a model of one of them,
showing the same sort of

00:54:43.635 --> 00:54:46.949
elements that we've seen in
Italy: the peristyle--

00:54:46.949 --> 00:54:48.400
this is the Hellenized
domus type--

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.659
the peristyle court over here.
 

00:54:50.659 --> 00:54:53.599
The compluvium of the
atrium over here.

00:54:53.599 --> 00:54:57.670
So it gives you--and then down
on this end, a colonnade with a

00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:59.139
pool in front of it.
 

00:54:59.139 --> 00:55:02.920
So very similar to the kinds of
things that we saw in Pompeii.

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:06.768
This is a view of some of the
ancient houses,

00:55:06.768 --> 00:55:10.833
as they look today,
and as they make up part of the

00:55:10.833 --> 00:55:15.230
modern town that surrounds them,
in Vaison-la-Romaine.

00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:17.721
You can see that they're
not--they're preserved,

00:55:17.721 --> 00:55:20.320
only the foundations
essentially are preserved.

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:23.688
But enough of them are to give
us a very good sense of the

00:55:23.688 --> 00:55:26.170
plans, the architectural plans
of these.

00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:29.675
And it can be interesting to
look at these in connection to

00:55:29.675 --> 00:55:33.128
what we have from Pompeii,
and to see how they stack up,

00:55:33.128 --> 00:55:35.880
and to whether they are
different in any way,

00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:39.329
because of the fact that they
were put up in what was ancient

00:55:39.329 --> 00:55:40.710
Gaul and not in Italy.
 

00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:45.869
And here a view of one of the
peristyle courts of one of

00:55:45.869 --> 00:55:48.590
those, as well as a mosaic.
 

00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:51.775
And if you look at what remains
of the wall painting,

00:55:51.775 --> 00:55:54.840
you can see that that is
completely consistent with

00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:57.659
what's going on in Italy at the
same time.

00:55:57.659 --> 00:56:00.643
Option 2 I'm not going to go
into in any detail,

00:56:00.643 --> 00:56:04.389
but you'll see when you look on
the website for Option 2;

00:56:04.389 --> 00:56:06.547
that that's called "Select
a Building, Select a

00:56:06.547 --> 00:56:07.139
Theme."
 

00:56:07.139 --> 00:56:09.760
If there is nothing here that
you liked,

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.760
but you do want to do a
research paper,

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:15.260
and there is some building that
you've seen on your travels,

00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:16.889
that we haven't talked about in
this course,

00:56:16.889 --> 00:56:19.800
or even a building that we have
talked about in this course,

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:21.409
but talked about in a few
minutes time,

00:56:21.409 --> 00:56:24.190
that you would like to write a
paper on,

00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:26.980
for some reason,
you may do that;

00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:29.840
and you would do it in the same
way that you do the first one.

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.018
It would be a research paper.
 

00:56:31.018 --> 00:56:34.398
You'd do--you will need to get
permission from me,

00:56:34.398 --> 00:56:36.260
for which one you choose.
 

00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:38.682
You can do this either directly
to me, by email,

00:56:38.682 --> 00:56:41.942
or via the teaching fellows;
you can go to them and they

00:56:41.942 --> 00:56:45.809
will likely be able to be my
surrogate, if the idea is good.

00:56:45.809 --> 00:56:48.280
And if they have any concerns,
they will let me know and we'll

00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:49.900
talk about it,
and we'll let you know.

00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:52.757
It would only be--the reason I
want you to come to us is just

00:56:52.757 --> 00:56:55.139
because if we think that there's
absolutely no--

00:56:55.139 --> 00:56:58.393
there's nothing to read on it,
it's going to be very hard for

00:56:58.393 --> 00:57:00.800
you to do,
we want to alert you to that.

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:04.755
We want to make sure you choose
something where there's a lot to

00:57:04.755 --> 00:57:08.585
think about and a lot to do that
will be a fruitful experience

00:57:08.585 --> 00:57:09.340
for you.
 

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.739
So that's Option 2.
 

00:57:10.739 --> 00:57:13.675
And then Option 3 is by
far--oh, I forgot one,

00:57:13.675 --> 00:57:14.460
I'm sorry.
 

00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:18.108
Very quickly,
the last topic under Number 1,

00:57:18.108 --> 00:57:22.021
the Tower Tombs at Palmyra;
we already talked about Palmyra

00:57:22.021 --> 00:57:22.489
in Syria.
 

00:57:22.489 --> 00:57:25.393
You see that these tombs here
are very distinctive,

00:57:25.393 --> 00:57:28.590
these tall tower-like tombs,
which is why they're called

00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:29.518
tower tombs.
 

00:57:29.518 --> 00:57:32.369
Here's one of them here,
made out of local stone,

00:57:32.369 --> 00:57:36.849
very stark, usually with a
niche in the center,

00:57:36.849 --> 00:57:39.952
that sometimes has a
representation of a deceased

00:57:39.952 --> 00:57:42.409
member of the family lying on a
bed.

00:57:42.409 --> 00:57:46.268
And here the interior of one of
these: very ornate;

00:57:46.268 --> 00:57:49.338
a coffered ceiling with
paintings, with portrait

00:57:49.338 --> 00:57:52.632
paintings in the top;
and then a series of niches

00:57:52.632 --> 00:57:56.481
where you see either single
portraits or group portraits of

00:57:56.481 --> 00:58:00.177
members of the same family,
sort of like what we saw on the

00:58:00.177 --> 00:58:02.079
outside of tombs on the Via
Appia,

00:58:02.079 --> 00:58:04.110
in this case on the inside of
tombs.

00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:06.494
This would be an interesting
topic for someone who would also

00:58:06.494 --> 00:58:07.885
like to use,
to go actually look at

00:58:07.885 --> 00:58:09.190
something at the Yale Art
Gallery,

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:12.730
because we have some of the
portraits that come from these

00:58:12.730 --> 00:58:15.340
Palmyrene tombs in the Yale Art
Gallery.

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:18.550
I show you one example of one
of those here.

00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:21.460
The last topic,
my favorite by far,

00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:24.230
and I really urge--this is a
tremendous amount of fun--

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:26.280
so I really urge as many of you
as possible,

00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:28.909
who would like to be truly
creative,

00:58:28.909 --> 00:58:30.809
to choose this topic.
 

00:58:30.809 --> 00:58:32.809
It's "Design Your Own
Roman City."

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:34.673
You're an architect,
city planner,

00:58:34.673 --> 00:58:38.119
you're competing for the major
commission of your lifetime.

00:58:38.119 --> 00:58:40.619
I'll let you read the rest of
that on the website.

00:58:40.619 --> 00:58:43.809
A colony of 10,000 people.
 

00:58:43.809 --> 00:58:47.940
You can build this anywhere in
the Roman world that you want.

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:50.643
So if there's a particular
place you've enjoyed vacationing

00:58:50.643 --> 00:58:53.253
and you want to put it there,
because you know that place

00:58:53.253 --> 00:58:54.280
well, that's fine.
 

00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:57.219
And you can almost do anything
that you want to do.

00:58:57.219 --> 00:59:00.605
You can be as creative and zany
as you want to be,

00:59:00.605 --> 00:59:01.780
as you do this.
 

00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:05.498
The only thing that I ask--and
you do need to do a paper along

00:59:05.498 --> 00:59:08.791
with this as well,
which is a paper that you'll

00:59:08.791 --> 00:59:11.559
see from the--
so there need to be drawings,

00:59:11.559 --> 00:59:14.530
which are either hand drawn or
computer generated.

00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:18.036
That would usually include the
city plan itself--although it

00:59:18.036 --> 00:59:20.889
doesn't have to--and a selection
of buildings.

00:59:20.889 --> 00:59:22.610
So it's going to take you some
time to do.

00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:25.101
Obviously if you're skilled at
drawing, or you're an

00:59:25.101 --> 00:59:27.445
Architecture major,
you're going to be able to do

00:59:27.445 --> 00:59:29.400
this more readily than someone
else.

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.159
But I just want to urge those
who don't--we had one project

00:59:32.159 --> 00:59:35.300
basically with stick figures one
time that was really fantastic.

00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:37.722
So even if your drawing skills
are not great,

00:59:37.722 --> 00:59:38.659
it's the ideas.
 

00:59:38.659 --> 00:59:40.840
Will we be impressed by great
drawings?

00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:42.000
You bet we will.
 

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.737
But I don't want to discourage
anyone for whom drawing is not

00:59:45.737 --> 00:59:48.253
your forte,
because I think it's really the

00:59:48.253 --> 00:59:52.150
ideas that count,
the creativity that counts here.

00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:55.599
But you can choose any
location--oh,

00:59:55.599 --> 00:59:57.449
I mentioned that there's a
paper that has to describe the

00:59:57.449 --> 00:59:58.898
colony,
the reason for its

00:59:58.898 --> 01:00:00.889
construction,
giving its name--

01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:03.719
and again, be very creative
here--its date,

01:00:03.719 --> 01:00:05.590
its location:
Italy or the provinces.

01:00:05.590 --> 01:00:08.054
You can pretty much put
anything you want in these

01:00:08.054 --> 01:00:10.670
cities, but in that paper you
have to explain why.

01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:14.195
For example,
if you were to build a town in

01:00:14.195 --> 01:00:17.329
Asia Minor,
and it were to be filled with

01:00:17.329 --> 01:00:20.076
concrete buildings--
which none of these towns

01:00:20.076 --> 01:00:23.206
were--you have to explain why
this particular town is filled

01:00:23.206 --> 01:00:24.639
with concrete buildings.
 

01:00:24.639 --> 01:00:28.431
And you can come up with as
crazy an explanation of that as

01:00:28.431 --> 01:00:30.539
possible;
in fact, the crazier the better.

01:00:30.539 --> 01:00:34.268
But you need to explain
something like that,

01:00:34.268 --> 01:00:37.070
so that we understand that you
know there was no concrete

01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:39.170
architecture in this part of the
world,

01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:43.110
but this particular town is
special because of the following

01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:43.780
reasons.
 

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:46.260
So I think you can see how your
creative juices can flow.

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:47.719
I just want to show you very
quickly,

01:00:47.719 --> 01:00:50.010
in the few, five or six minutes
that remain,

01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:53.119
a series of these that were
done by students over time,

01:00:53.119 --> 01:00:55.800
just to serve as a--I hope they
won't be intimidating--

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.840
but rather to serve as an
inspiration.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:00.248
There are a couple of them
along the way that were done by

01:01:00.248 --> 01:01:02.530
students of Architecture,
that are particularly good in

01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:03.630
terms of the drawings.
 

01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:08.110
But others you'll see are quite
simple, and I want to show you

01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:11.710
to not be intimidated by this
particular topic.

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:14.769
This is a wonderful city that
someone created on a harbor.

01:01:14.769 --> 01:01:16.050
You can see the docks.
 

01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:18.596
You can also see the Port
Authority that has been added

01:01:18.596 --> 01:01:20.199
here, as well as the warehouses.
 

01:01:20.199 --> 01:01:22.958
There's some misspellings,
like cenaculae over

01:01:22.958 --> 01:01:24.217
here;
Livian Baths,

01:01:24.217 --> 01:01:25.650
I guess after Livia.
 

01:01:25.650 --> 01:01:28.056
But look at this wonderful
forum where we have a temple

01:01:28.056 --> 01:01:29.929
pushed up against one of the
back walls.

01:01:29.929 --> 01:01:32.793
For some reason there's a
tetrapylon in the middle of the

01:01:32.793 --> 01:01:35.965
forum, which kind of works for
this street, but I'm not exactly

01:01:35.965 --> 01:01:37.449
sure where it goes,
here;

01:01:37.449 --> 01:01:39.210
but it's an interesting motif.
 

01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:41.664
And then this market,
this sort of interesting

01:01:41.664 --> 01:01:44.336
circular market that kind of
projects on one side,

01:01:44.336 --> 01:01:46.409
creating a very interesting
shape;

01:01:46.409 --> 01:01:47.929
gives you some idea.
 

01:01:47.929 --> 01:01:50.358
And a very regular plan,
as you can see for this

01:01:50.358 --> 01:01:51.289
particular city.
 

01:01:51.289 --> 01:01:53.211
This was done by a graduate
student actually,

01:01:53.211 --> 01:01:56.056
in the Architecture School;
very extraordinary drawings,

01:01:56.056 --> 01:01:57.409
and it was a huge plan.
 

01:01:57.409 --> 01:02:00.179
But just to show you again how
creative it was,

01:02:00.179 --> 01:02:02.467
the City of Ultorium,
after Mars Ultor,

01:02:02.467 --> 01:02:03.309
of course.
 

01:02:03.309 --> 01:02:08.280
And you can see some wonderful
motifs, and all of them

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.969
identified here.
 

01:02:09.969 --> 01:02:12.047
This large temple,
a tetrapylon,

01:02:12.047 --> 01:02:15.534
there's always a fascination
with tetrapylons in this

01:02:15.534 --> 01:02:18.088
project;
some other structures over

01:02:18.088 --> 01:02:20.510
here, including a marketplace at
7.

01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:24.360
But I love, at 6, the curia;
you never see a round curia,

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.739
but this is a round curia,
which is absolutely terrific,

01:02:27.739 --> 01:02:30.858
opening off the basilica,
which you see over here,

01:02:30.858 --> 01:02:34.152
which is very closely based on
basilican architecture of the

01:02:34.152 --> 01:02:36.420
Trajanic Period,
and into the Severan period.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.190
Some interesting wedge shaped
shops over here.

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:42.449
So again, it gives you some
sense of what's possible.

01:02:42.449 --> 01:02:46.896
This, not by an Architecture
student, but another one of

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:51.909
these port cities that has--I
love this--the sunken theater;

01:02:51.909 --> 01:02:54.688
you can see the sunken theater
that goes right into the sea,

01:02:54.688 --> 01:02:57.090
over here, on this side,
but as well as the port.

01:02:57.090 --> 01:02:59.246
You can see this was a
Flavian--so again,

01:02:59.246 --> 01:03:01.510
you got to decide where you
want to put it,

01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:04.800
which period--the Flavian
period, so a Flavian port city.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.224
This, another one,
also I think from that same

01:03:08.224 --> 01:03:12.030
project, where you can see the
Flavian basilica;

01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:15.221
a Capitolium with a Temple to
Jupiter, Juno,

01:03:15.221 --> 01:03:16.260
and Minerva.
 

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:19.581
And then Titus is honored over
here, with his statue,

01:03:19.581 --> 01:03:23.030
and a couple of victory
statues, one on either side.

01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:24.980
Again, I think from the same
project,

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:28.427
this is the city itself,
where you can see it has an

01:03:28.427 --> 01:03:31.275
amphitheater,
it has a basilica and a forum,

01:03:31.275 --> 01:03:33.690
and it also has a colonnaded
courtyard,

01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:35.050
a colonnaded street.
 

01:03:35.050 --> 01:03:37.791
If you build a colonnaded
street in a town in Italy,

01:03:37.791 --> 01:03:41.123
you've got to explain why this
is the only colonnaded street in

01:03:41.123 --> 01:03:42.199
a town in Italy.
 

01:03:42.199 --> 01:03:45.000
If you put it in the East,
it's obvious.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.643
Same project I think again,
the--it should be the Thermae

01:03:48.643 --> 01:03:50.139
Titi and the Library.
 

01:03:50.139 --> 01:03:53.489
But I love this because the
person has identified the stone.

01:03:53.489 --> 01:03:56.831
In the amphitheater here,
stone has been imported from

01:03:56.831 --> 01:03:59.795
all over the world,
from Syria and from Ephesus,

01:03:59.795 --> 01:04:02.570
to be used in this particular
structure.

01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:05.309
An arch--again I think also;
this was a very ambitious

01:04:05.309 --> 01:04:08.478
project--an arch from that same
project, with a victory at the

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:09.829
top and an inscription.
 

01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:11.827
And then this,
the victory gate,

01:04:11.827 --> 01:04:14.920
again with the amphitheater in
the background.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:18.590
This was something simpler but
interesting: a small fountain;

01:04:18.590 --> 01:04:21.840
composite capitals;
coffered, misspelled; apse;

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:24.639
a philosopher pose of Titus;
scalloped pool,

01:04:24.639 --> 01:04:25.969
with a triple basin.
 

01:04:25.969 --> 01:04:29.300
This one, very simple and very
derivative in a way;

01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:30.909
but I love this one anyway.
 

01:04:30.909 --> 01:04:33.989
This house plan shows us that
the person was basing it on

01:04:33.989 --> 01:04:34.760
which house?
 

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.501
It was actually on the exam,
although you didn't see the

01:04:37.501 --> 01:04:37.849
plan.
 

01:04:37.849 --> 01:04:39.960
Student:  Mosaic.
 

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.739
Prof: House of the
Mosaic Atrium,

01:04:41.739 --> 01:04:45.230
because remember up at the top,
the entranceway,

01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:48.219
the atrium and the oecus
at the far end,

01:04:48.219 --> 01:04:49.610
in the form of a basilica.
 

01:04:49.610 --> 01:04:51.139
So a very derivative plan.
 

01:04:51.139 --> 01:04:54.807
But I just love this touch;
just this touch did it for me,

01:04:54.807 --> 01:04:59.248
sticking those two palm trees
in the center of the peristyle

01:04:59.248 --> 01:05:00.679
court was great.
 

01:05:00.679 --> 01:05:02.929
And I forget again exactly
where this town was,

01:05:02.929 --> 01:05:04.809
but it had something to do with
that particular--

01:05:04.809 --> 01:05:07.789
the kinds of flora and fauna of
that particular part of the

01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:08.199
world.
 

01:05:08.199 --> 01:05:09.820
This was another wonderful one.
 

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:12.972
A big city plan;
a huge piece of oak tag,

01:05:12.972 --> 01:05:16.737
with the entire city,
a city of the Severan period,

01:05:16.737 --> 01:05:20.157
Septimius Severus,
with buildings honoring him and

01:05:20.157 --> 01:05:22.369
his son,
Caracalla, for example.

01:05:22.369 --> 01:05:24.853
But this one,
because Septimius Severus' wife

01:05:24.853 --> 01:05:28.240
was particularly interested in
astrological signs and used to

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:31.460
tell him each day what his day
was going to be like,

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:35.092
based on those signs,
the student incorporated

01:05:35.092 --> 01:05:38.159
elements of the Mithraic
Mysteries,

01:05:38.159 --> 01:05:40.909
and those astrological signs,
as you can see here,

01:05:40.909 --> 01:05:43.750
in many of these buildings:
a Mithraic garden,

01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:46.670
and so on and so forth,
which was really wonderful.

01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:47.606
This was great.
 

01:05:47.606 --> 01:05:51.039
This was someone who made a
book, and included in it was

01:05:51.039 --> 01:05:54.472
kind of a treasure map that
included a preamble to where

01:05:54.472 --> 01:05:55.659
this city was.
 

01:05:55.659 --> 01:05:59.157
And interspersed within
this--and it was made to look

01:05:59.157 --> 01:06:02.791
very old, as if it was just
discovered by Harrison Ford

01:06:02.791 --> 01:06:03.599
himself.
 

01:06:03.599 --> 01:06:10.313
And we see these wonderful
plans interspersed with the

01:06:10.313 --> 01:06:11.199
text.
 

01:06:11.199 --> 01:06:15.128
Then this, a small simple
house, again with some wonderful

01:06:15.128 --> 01:06:18.230
wall paintings,
of I guess the Third Style.

01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:20.760
And this, my absolute favorite,
still to this day.

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:24.780
This was done probably in the
early '80s,

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:28.302
when I began teaching a version
of this course in the early

01:06:28.302 --> 01:06:31.706
'80s,
by a student who is Petrus

01:06:31.706 --> 01:06:34.807
Greenburgius,
Peter Greenberg,

01:06:34.807 --> 01:06:39.329
who presented his project in
the form of a scroll.

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:41.300
He knew very well there were no
books at this time,

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.130
there were scrolls.
 

01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:44.150
And so he presented this long
scroll.

01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:47.992
I can't even imagine how long
this text took him to write on

01:06:47.992 --> 01:06:50.722
this scroll,
but it was a long scroll and it

01:06:50.722 --> 01:06:54.003
came and it was tied up with a
nice ribbon and so on and so

01:06:54.003 --> 01:06:56.590
forth,
and you unfurled it and it had

01:06:56.590 --> 01:06:58.610
the text, all about his town.
 

01:06:58.610 --> 01:07:01.291
He was the architect,
if I remember correctly,

01:07:01.291 --> 01:07:03.853
the designer,
and he was presenting his case

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:05.820
to the emperor,
or to the empress,

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:07.369
in my--you know,
me.

01:07:07.369 --> 01:07:08.420
&gt;
 

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:11.532
So he was presenting his case
to me about this city that he

01:07:11.532 --> 01:07:13.840
wanted to build,
and was I going to give him

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:15.289
permission to build it?
 

01:07:15.289 --> 01:07:18.588
So interspersed with this text
were these wonderful drawings of

01:07:18.588 --> 01:07:19.760
what he had in mind.
 

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.146
So, I mean, there are so
many--this is one of many,

01:07:22.146 --> 01:07:24.010
many wonderful ones that I've
gotten.

01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:25.659
I hope this will be
inspirational to you.

01:07:25.659 --> 01:07:27.599
I can't say,
"Have a great break"

01:07:27.599 --> 01:07:29.768
quite yet, because we have
class on Thursday.

01:07:29.768 --> 01:07:32.630
But I know you're all looking
forward to it,

01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:35.679
and I hope that your travels
can in some way include--

01:07:35.679 --> 01:07:38.420
even if you're just going to
the beach in Cancun--

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:40.389
I hope it can include,
in some way,

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:43.639
thinking about buildings and
about this project.

01:07:43.639 --> 01:07:44.500
Thank you.

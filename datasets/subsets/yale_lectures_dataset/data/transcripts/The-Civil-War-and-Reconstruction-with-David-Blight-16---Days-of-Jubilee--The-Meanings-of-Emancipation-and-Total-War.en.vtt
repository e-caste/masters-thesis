00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.326
Professor David Blight:
The first formally recognized or

00:00:17.326 --> 00:00:22.199
organized black regiment in the
Civil War was known as the First

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.149
South Carolina Volunteers.
It was organized entirely and

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:32.681
exclusively among freed slaves,
along the Sea Islands of South

00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:36.031
Carolina.
It had an amazing

00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:43.083
non-commissioned officer whose
name was Prince Rivers,

00:00:43.083 --> 00:00:49.869
a man who'd been a slave
yesterday but a free man by

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:53.848
1862,
and whose white commanding

00:00:53.848 --> 00:00:57.922
officer, Thomas Wentworth
Higginson said,

00:00:57.922 --> 00:01:00.672
"in another land,
in another time,

00:01:00.672 --> 00:01:02.500
he could command any army in
the world."

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.133
Thomas Wentworth Higginson was
an abolitionist from Worcester,

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:13.778
Massachusetts who ended up the
colonel and the commander of

00:01:13.778 --> 00:01:18.196
that regiment.
Nearly 1,000 freed slaves were

00:01:18.196 --> 00:01:24.659
recruited among the roughly 35
to 40,000 former slaves along

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.370
the Georgian/South Carolina Sea
Islands.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.115
Higginson went on to write a
great book about it called

00:01:33.115 --> 00:01:35.819
Army Life in a Black
Regiment,

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:40.576
and among the remarkable
descriptions he left in that

00:01:40.576 --> 00:01:45.790
classic is this description from
Thanksgiving Day 1862;

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.888
so it's November '62.
The preliminary Emancipation

00:01:50.888 --> 00:01:55.902
Proclamation is in place but the
final Emancipation Proclamation

00:01:55.902 --> 00:02:00.023
hasn't quite happened yet.
It was actually the first

00:02:00.023 --> 00:02:02.779
formally, legally,
federally recognized

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:05.920
Thanksgiving Day;
so decreed by Abraham Lincoln.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.107
And Higginson had his
headquarters in an old

00:02:11.107 --> 00:02:15.631
plantation house.
He looked out of broken

00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:21.259
windows, at this abandoned
plantation in the Sea Islands,

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:26.453
through what he described as
"the great avenues of great live

00:02:26.453 --> 00:02:29.569
oaks," and he observed that
quote,

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.210
"All this is a universal
southern panorama,

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.064
but five minutes walk beyond
the hovels and the live oaks

00:02:38.064 --> 00:02:42.832
will bring one to something so
unsouthern that the whole

00:02:42.832 --> 00:02:47.859
southern coast at this moment
trembles at the suggestion of

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.702
such a thing,
a camp of a regiment of freed

00:02:52.702 --> 00:02:53.640
slaves."

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.217
Almost two years later one of
those freed slaves named George

00:03:02.217 --> 00:03:06.689
Hatton wrote a couple of letters
from the front.

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.560
George Hatton was a former
slave.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.396
He had lived part of his life
in Washington,

00:03:13.396 --> 00:03:16.760
DC, part of his life in
Virginia, North Carolina;

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.458
he'd been around.
He was at this point,

00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:24.684
by April of 1864,
a non-commissioned sergeant in

00:03:24.684 --> 00:03:29.990
Company C, First Regiment,
United States Colored Troops.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.843
They were in camp New Bern,
North Carolina,

00:03:32.843 --> 00:03:36.376
and he sat down to write a
letter to reflect upon the

00:03:36.376 --> 00:03:39.229
circumstance that he found
himself in.

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:45.383
Hatton, his fellow soldiers,
and their families had lived

00:03:45.383 --> 00:03:52.860
generations as slaves.
And this is what he wrote.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.908
He says, "Though the government
openly declared that it did not

00:03:56.908 --> 00:03:59.259
want the Negroes in this
conflict,

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:03.097
I look around me and see
hundreds of colored men armed

00:04:03.097 --> 00:04:06.789
and ready to defend the
government at any moment.

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:12.269
And such are my feelings that I
can only say the fetters have

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.062
fallen, our bondage is over."
A month later Hatton's regiment

00:04:17.062 --> 00:04:20.544
was in camp near Jamestown,
Virginia--and he didn't miss

00:04:20.544 --> 00:04:27.199
the irony of being at Jamestown,
the founding site of Virginia.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:33.665
And into his lines came several
black freed women who all

00:04:33.665 --> 00:04:40.940
declared they had recently been
severely whipped by a master.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.530
Members of Hatton's company
managed to capture that slave

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.481
owner, a Mr.
Clayton, the man who had

00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:52.990
allegedly administered the
beatings on these women.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.850
The white Virginian was
stripped to the waist.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.018
He was tied to a tree and he
was given 20 lashes by one of

00:05:02.018 --> 00:05:06.461
his own former slaves,
a man named William Harris,

00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:10.360
who was now a member of the
Union Army.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.978
In turn, each of the women that
Clayton had beaten were given

00:05:16.978 --> 00:05:23.817
the whip and their chance to lay
the lash on this slaveholder's

00:05:23.817 --> 00:05:27.181
back.
"The women were given leave,"

00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:31.759
said Sergeant Hatton--his
words--"to remind him that they

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:36.583
were not longer his but safely
housed in Abraham's bosom and

00:05:36.583 --> 00:05:41.652
under the protection of the Star
Spangled Banner and guarded by

00:05:41.652 --> 00:05:47.589
their own patriotic,
though once downtrodden race."

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:53.127
In Hatton's letter he once
again felt lost for words to

00:05:53.127 --> 00:05:58.050
describe the transformation he
was witnessing.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.227
"Oh that I had the tongue to
express my feelings," he wrote,

00:06:02.227 --> 00:06:06.546
"while standing on the banks of
the James River on the soil of

00:06:06.546 --> 00:06:09.944
Old Virginia,
the mother-state of slavery,

00:06:09.944 --> 00:06:13.000
as a witness of such a sudden
reverse.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.029
The day is clear,
the fields of grain are

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:25.072
beautiful and the birds are
singing sweet melodious songs

00:06:25.072 --> 00:06:29.850
while poor Mr.
Clayton is crying to his

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.688
servants for mercy."
That's a revolution,

00:06:34.688 --> 00:06:37.825
described in the words of a
former slave,

00:06:37.825 --> 00:06:42.138
words that were trying to
capture the transformations of

00:06:42.138 --> 00:06:46.843
history at the same time his
actions were trying to transform

00:06:46.843 --> 00:06:48.020
history.

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:57.008
Words.
Now, we will forever debate in

00:06:57.008 --> 00:07:05.540
this society the meaning of the
Emancipation Proclamation.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.053
Over and over and over again we
debate: did it really free

00:07:09.053 --> 00:07:11.304
anybody?
Why did it only free the slaves

00:07:11.304 --> 00:07:14.317
in the states in rebellion?
Why was Lincoln so bloody

00:07:14.317 --> 00:07:17.912
legalistic in this document?
Was Richard Hofstadter right

00:07:17.912 --> 00:07:21.538
when he said it had all the
eloquence of a bill of lading

00:07:21.538 --> 00:07:26.569
(which means a grocery list)?
Why was it written like it was

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:31.799
a legal brief in court,
here and there laced with some

00:07:31.799 --> 00:07:36.131
remarkable phrases?
Why was he so careful not to

00:07:36.131 --> 00:07:40.455
free the slaves in the Border
States that hadn't left the

00:07:40.455 --> 00:07:44.819
union?
And on and on.

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:48.517
But I think we should make no
mistake, the Emancipation

00:07:48.517 --> 00:07:52.420
Proclamation is a terribly
important American document.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.839
Emancipation is not just the
story of great documents,

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:59.129
as I'm trying to argue,
but this one's important.

00:07:59.129 --> 00:08:05.656
The second paragraph reads--and
this is, by the way,

00:08:05.656 --> 00:08:10.958
Lincoln's own handwriting;
this is a facsimile of the

00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.515
original;
he wrote some three or four

00:08:13.515 --> 00:08:17.657
originals--"that on the First
Day of January in this year of

00:08:17.657 --> 00:08:20.793
Our Lord,
One Thousand Eight Hundred and

00:08:20.793 --> 00:08:25.226
Sixty-Three, all persons held as
slaves within any state or

00:08:25.226 --> 00:08:29.940
designated part of a state,
the people whereof shall then

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:34.029
be in rebellion against the
United States"--God,

00:08:34.029 --> 00:08:39.665
is this legalistic--"shall be
then"--this is not

00:08:39.665 --> 00:08:45.899
legalistic--"then,
thenceforward and forever free.

00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:50.415
And the Executive governments
of this United States,

00:08:50.415 --> 00:08:55.284
including the military and
naval authority thereof"--the

00:08:55.284 --> 00:09:00.773
Army and Navy are now bound to
do this it says--"will recognize

00:09:00.773 --> 00:09:06.174
and maintain the freedom of such
persons and will do no act or

00:09:06.174 --> 00:09:11.989
acts to repress such persons,
or any of them,

00:09:11.989 --> 00:09:21.470
in any efforts they may make
for their actual freedom."

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.910
Actual freedom.

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:40.179
Now, yes, it was a limited
document.

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:43.956
It didn't free as many slaves
as the Second Confiscation Act

00:09:43.956 --> 00:09:46.260
had legally already set in
motion.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:51.305
That's true.
But this is the most important

00:09:51.305 --> 00:09:54.029
thing to remember about the
Emancipation Proclamation.

00:09:54.029 --> 00:10:00.090
Most black folks didn't care
about the details of it.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:06.404
What they cared about is that
the United States Government had

00:10:06.404 --> 00:10:10.960
acted and said they were going
to be free.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.367
There were at least four
immediate and visible effects of

00:10:14.367 --> 00:10:17.045
the Proclamation,
once it went into effect on

00:10:17.045 --> 00:10:20.791
January^( )1.
Every forward step of the Union

00:10:20.791 --> 00:10:25.165
armies now would be,
whether some of those officers

00:10:25.165 --> 00:10:28.490
liked it or not,
a liberating step.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:32.467
Secondly, news of this
Proclamation,

00:10:32.467 --> 00:10:37.240
whatever the details and the
fine print,

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.733
would spread like wildfire
across the South,

00:10:41.733 --> 00:10:46.749
and it would bring
about--there's no question--it

00:10:46.749 --> 00:10:50.929
will bring about increased
activity,

00:10:50.929 --> 00:10:54.228
increased flight,
increased movement toward Union

00:10:54.228 --> 00:10:57.389
lines by freed people,
where they can do it.

00:10:57.389 --> 00:11:01.926
And there's all over the record
we have testimony of Confederate

00:11:01.926 --> 00:11:04.250
soldiers themselves,
of Southerners,

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.063
white Southerners themselves
saying they first heard about

00:11:07.063 --> 00:11:09.580
the Emancipation Proclamation
from their slaves.

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:17.774
Third, it committed the United
States Government in the eyes of

00:11:17.774 --> 00:11:20.977
the world--and that's terribly
important when we remember that

00:11:20.977 --> 00:11:23.654
Great Britain was on the verge
of recognition of the

00:11:23.654 --> 00:11:26.700
Confederacy--more on that a bit
later in the course,

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.548
of how that foreign
relationship and the problem of

00:11:29.548 --> 00:11:33.080
Civil War diplomacy is being
managed by the two governments,

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.545
Union and Confederate.
And fourth, on the second page

00:11:37.545 --> 00:11:40.989
of the Emancipation
Proclamation--or is it the

00:11:40.989 --> 00:11:44.815
third--in another very
legalistic paragraph Lincoln

00:11:44.815 --> 00:11:48.029
formally authorizes once and for
all,

00:11:48.029 --> 00:11:52.808
although it's already begun to
happen, the recruitment of black

00:11:52.808 --> 00:11:55.659
men into the Union Armies and
Navy,

00:11:55.659 --> 00:12:03.178
and it authorizes a formal
process now to recruit black men

00:12:03.178 --> 00:12:09.046
to the Union uniform.
And before the war will end

00:12:09.046 --> 00:12:13.750
about ten percent of all Union
forces will be

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:20.485
African-American-- approximately
180,000--eighty percent of whom

00:12:20.485 --> 00:12:25.509
were former slaves,
from the slave states.

00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:30.179
Now, in that fall of 1862,
Frederick Douglass put down his

00:12:30.179 --> 00:12:35.013
cudgel that he'd been beating
Lincoln with for a year in his

00:12:35.013 --> 00:12:39.110
editorials--and he beat him
bitterly at times.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:43.127
At one point in late '61 he
called Abraham Lincoln the most

00:12:43.127 --> 00:12:45.759
powerful slave catcher in the
world.

00:12:45.759 --> 00:12:49.243
That was Douglass's opinion of
that denial of asylum policy

00:12:49.243 --> 00:12:52.607
which said fugitive slaves
escaping Union lines had to be

00:12:52.607 --> 00:12:55.009
returned if their owners were
loyal.

00:12:55.009 --> 00:13:00.145
Douglass, like many others,
saw the nonsense in that policy

00:13:00.145 --> 00:13:04.047
early on.
Douglass finally put down the

00:13:04.047 --> 00:13:07.783
cudgel and he said,
with lovely irony,

00:13:07.783 --> 00:13:12.342
"It is really wonderful,"
said Frederick Douglass,

00:13:12.342 --> 00:13:16.456
"how all efforts to evade,
postpone and prevent its coming

00:13:16.456 --> 00:13:21.220
have been mocked and defied by
the stupendous sweep of events";

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:25.850
its coming meaning black
freedom.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:31.316
And I'll just say lastly,
add a fifth to that,

00:13:31.316 --> 00:13:37.389
emancipation transformed the
purpose of the war.

00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:40.772
Emancipation more than anything
else will make the Civil War a

00:13:40.772 --> 00:13:44.112
war of conquest,
a war of near totality,

00:13:44.112 --> 00:13:47.268
on both sides,
and it meant now,

00:13:47.268 --> 00:13:53.480
now that this was going to be a
war of conquest on the South's

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:57.350
social and economic
institutions,

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:04.769
it meant it would probably only
end in unconditional surrender.

00:14:04.769 --> 00:14:08.600
Now, it's a complicated story
as to how this'll be enforced,

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.678
of course.
And I strongly urge you to read

00:14:11.678 --> 00:14:15.980
certain of those Lincoln
documents in the Johnson reader,

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.987
and more importantly,
to read at least that greatest

00:14:19.987 --> 00:14:24.938
hits selection I provided in the
reading packet of the documents

00:14:24.938 --> 00:14:27.335
on emancipation;
which, by the way,

00:14:27.335 --> 00:14:29.120
come out of a book called
Free at Last,

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:34.445
which is itself a 500 page
collection of the greatest hits

00:14:34.445 --> 00:14:38.929
of the documents of the American
emancipation,

00:14:38.929 --> 00:14:43.840
which are now published in five
volumes, all of which are in the

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.604
National Archives.
But one of those Lincoln

00:14:46.604 --> 00:14:49.414
documents I don't want you to
miss, I said the other day,

00:14:49.414 --> 00:14:53.059
was the James Conkling letter.
It comes in August of '63.

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:58.049
One of the reasons that letter
is interesting is that it shows

00:14:58.049 --> 00:15:02.629
us that though Lincoln could be
one crafty politician;

00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:06.765
and whether emancipation will
ever truly succeed in this war,

00:15:06.765 --> 00:15:10.970
of course, depends on the Union
winning on the battlefield.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:15.559
It really depended on all those
deaths at Gettysburg and at

00:15:15.559 --> 00:15:19.200
Vicksburg and so many other
horrible places.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.214
And yes, it's true that large,
large numbers of those Union

00:15:23.214 --> 00:15:26.882
soldiers who died didn't
necessarily believe they were

00:15:26.882 --> 00:15:30.169
fighting to free slaves,
nor did they even want to.

00:15:30.169 --> 00:15:34.254
But sometimes history is ahead
of anyone's basic human,

00:15:34.254 --> 00:15:36.600
individual motives,
isn't it?

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.953
But in this Conkling letter,
so called, it's a public letter

00:15:40.953 --> 00:15:45.159
that--Lincoln mastered this
presidential art of the public

00:15:45.159 --> 00:15:49.660
letter more than any previous
president and it was his version

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:53.405
of the news conference,
which didn't happen in those

00:15:53.405 --> 00:15:55.760
days.
It was his version of an

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.111
exclusive interview with
Anderson Cooper,

00:15:59.111 --> 00:16:02.629
or whatever the hell it would
be today.

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:05.444
He wrote letters aimed at
certain newspapers which would

00:16:05.444 --> 00:16:07.440
then be reprinted across the
country.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.368
This was a letter to James
Conkling, Congressman from

00:16:11.368 --> 00:16:16.023
Illinois, of his own party,
who was opposing emancipation,

00:16:16.023 --> 00:16:20.129
who was at least wary of it and
worried about it.

00:16:20.129 --> 00:16:23.301
The great worry about the
emancipation policy,

00:16:23.301 --> 00:16:27.529
of course, was that white
Northerners would not accept it,

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:29.883
that white northern soldiers
would thrown down their arms and

00:16:29.883 --> 00:16:31.610
say, "I ain't fighting to free
the slaves.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.710
I'm fighting to preserve the
Union, thank you very much."

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.730
Lincoln had that great fear
himself.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:46.141
But God, read that letter.
It's one of Lincoln's--it's

00:16:46.141 --> 00:16:51.489
Lincoln the ironist;
it's also Lincoln the

00:16:51.489 --> 00:16:55.600
persuasive lawyer.
On the second page of it he

00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.210
says to Conkling--he's really
saying this to white northerners

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:02.053
now,
because this letter got

00:17:02.053 --> 00:17:04.909
published everywhere--"You
dislike the Emancipation

00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:07.758
Proclamation,"
he says, "and perhaps would

00:17:07.758 --> 00:17:11.850
have it retracted.
You say it is unconstitutional.

00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:15.797
I think differently.
I think the Constitution

00:17:15.797 --> 00:17:19.416
invests its commander-in-chief
with the law of war,

00:17:19.416 --> 00:17:23.374
in time of war.
The most that can be said,

00:17:23.374 --> 00:17:27.970
if so much, is that the slaves
are property.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:33.091
Is there, has there ever been
any question that by law of war

00:17:33.091 --> 00:17:37.785
property, both of enemies and
friends, may be taken when

00:17:37.785 --> 00:17:40.970
needed?"
So there's that argument.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:43.140
Whatever you think of the
morality of this,

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.310
folks, slaves are property of
the enemy;

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:50.150
I'm taking their assets.
It's a legal argument.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:53.142
Then you go to the next
page--he's also beginning to

00:17:53.142 --> 00:17:56.595
make there an argument,
if you read that part of the

00:17:56.595 --> 00:18:00.140
letter carefully,
it's an argument for total war,

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:04.750
to unconditional surrender,
and he's trying to condition

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:09.890
public opinion for this.
Then you go to the next page.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:13.660
"You say you will not fight to
free Negroes.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:17.930
Some of them seem wiling to
fight for you.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.663
But no matter,
fight you then,

00:18:20.663 --> 00:18:25.417
exclusively to save the Union.
I issued the Proclamation on

00:18:25.417 --> 00:18:27.900
purpose to aid you in saving the
Union.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.844
Whenever you shall have
conquered all resistance to the

00:18:30.844 --> 00:18:33.569
Union, if I shall urge you to
continue fighting,

00:18:33.569 --> 00:18:38.070
it will be an apt time then for
you to declare you will not

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.010
fight to free Negroes."

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:49.746
All right, crawl into your
cul-de-sac and say you're only

00:18:49.746 --> 00:18:54.638
fighting to save the Union,
but here's another way to save

00:18:54.638 --> 00:18:58.250
the Union.
And then he goes on.

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:01.348
"I thought that in your
struggle for the Union,

00:19:01.348 --> 00:19:05.660
to whatever extent the Negroes
should cease helping the enemy,

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:10.120
to that extent it weakened the
enemy in his resistance to you.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.620
Do you think differently?
I thought that whatever Negroes

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.747
can be got to do as soldiers
leaves just so much less for

00:19:16.747 --> 00:19:19.260
white soldiers to do in saving
the Union."

00:19:22.259 --> 00:19:26.473
It's almost as if he's
appealing to Conkling's racial

00:19:26.473 --> 00:19:31.119
self-interest;
does it appear otherwise to you?

00:19:31.119 --> 00:19:34.826
And then Lincoln says,
"But Negroes,

00:19:34.826 --> 00:19:38.849
like other people,
act upon motives.

00:19:38.849 --> 00:19:43.525
Why should they do anything for
us if we will do nothing for

00:19:43.525 --> 00:19:46.189
them?
If they stake their lives for

00:19:46.189 --> 00:19:49.754
us, they must be prompted by the
strongest motive,

00:19:49.754 --> 00:19:55.450
even the promise of freedom.
And the promise being made must

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:56.560
be kept."

00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:04.336
Okay, blah, blah,
blah, lots of words,

00:20:04.336 --> 00:20:09.900
right?
Words, words, words, words.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:16.132
Yes, but meanings are almost
always somewhere,

00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:21.373
somehow embedded in words.
Now, as I said,

00:20:21.373 --> 00:20:26.643
now every forward step of the
Union armies is going to be a

00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:30.082
liberating step.
And I want to show just a quick

00:20:30.082 --> 00:20:31.960
map here to illustrate
something.

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.498
And I can zoom in on that.
I hope you can see the colors

00:20:52.498 --> 00:20:57.259
here to some extent.
The simple point of this map is

00:20:57.259 --> 00:20:59.603
this.
It's a map that shows the

00:20:59.603 --> 00:21:03.230
conquest of the South by Union
forces, it's the movement,

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:07.980
generally speaking,
of Union lines into the South

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.950
in what becomes now,
by '62,

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:14.765
'63 and '64,
a war of conquest,

00:21:14.765 --> 00:21:19.151
West and East.
But I want to especially stress

00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:23.779
that the most important factor
in when and where a slave might

00:21:23.779 --> 00:21:27.897
attain his or her freedom;
the first factor had everything

00:21:27.897 --> 00:21:30.000
to do with where the armies
went.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.203
It was proximity to the war
that made emancipation possible

00:21:34.203 --> 00:21:37.767
in northern Virginia in 1862;
Sea Islands of Georgia,

00:21:37.767 --> 00:21:38.970
South Carolina,
'62;

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:42.109
around the whole New Orleans
region in '62;

00:21:42.109 --> 00:21:45.550
but not possible at all in
southern Georgia until after the

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:48.123
war was over;
not possible really at all in

00:21:48.123 --> 00:21:51.549
the southern half of Alabama
until the whole war was over;

00:21:51.549 --> 00:21:55.448
not possible at all in parts of
Mississippi until the whole war

00:21:55.448 --> 00:21:58.669
was over.
Hence, that's why the large

00:21:58.669 --> 00:22:04.572
majority of American slaves were
not actually within Union lines

00:22:04.572 --> 00:22:08.789
or technically free,
in any way, until the war

00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:13.590
ended.
I'll make one other point about

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.864
this.
There's a nice book by a

00:22:15.864 --> 00:22:20.347
historian named Stephen Ash.
It's called When the Yankees

00:22:20.347 --> 00:22:25.582
Came, and it's all about the
process of Union occupation of

00:22:25.582 --> 00:22:29.528
parts of the South.
He goes in and studies towns in

00:22:29.528 --> 00:22:33.571
Tennessee and towns in northern
Georgia and towns in northern

00:22:33.571 --> 00:22:35.587
Virginia,
and tries to understand,

00:22:35.587 --> 00:22:37.700
so what happened when an area
of the South,

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.769
an area of the Confederacy,
came under Union control?

00:22:40.769 --> 00:22:43.410
And he divides the South
usefully here;

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:47.861
and it's very useful in
understanding how emancipation

00:22:47.861 --> 00:22:52.900
actually happened on the ground
as a human, sometimes brutal,

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.839
ugly, chaotic,
painful process.

00:22:55.839 --> 00:23:00.896
He divides the South into what
he calls three regions:

00:23:00.896 --> 00:23:04.140
one, the "Confederate
frontier";

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.210
the second he calls "no-man's
land";

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:10.150
and the third he calls
"garrisoned towns."

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:12.200
Now that's pretty easy to
understand.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.609
If you think of--just take
Tennessee, up there in the

00:23:15.609 --> 00:23:19.484
middle.
By 1862 Nashville became a--it

00:23:19.484 --> 00:23:26.599
was the capital of Tennessee--it
became a garrisoned Union town;

00:23:26.599 --> 00:23:29.824
that is, it's occupied,
its resources,

00:23:29.824 --> 00:23:32.264
its railroad,
its everything,

00:23:32.264 --> 00:23:35.750
were taken over by the Union
forces.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:39.528
And then there's the so called
no-man's land,

00:23:39.528 --> 00:23:43.565
the region say between a
Nashville and where the

00:23:43.565 --> 00:23:48.279
Confederate forces were,
the land between the armies,

00:23:48.279 --> 00:23:52.900
which of course fluctuated a
great deal back and forth.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.680
And then lastly he calls it the
Confederate frontier,

00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:00.680
or at times he'll call it the
Confederate hinterland,

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:05.315
that is the land behind the
lines that was never taken by

00:24:05.315 --> 00:24:08.957
Union forces,
the land behind the lines where

00:24:08.957 --> 00:24:13.007
Confederate resources,
relatively speaking,

00:24:13.007 --> 00:24:17.354
remained intact.
They're still producing cotton

00:24:17.354 --> 00:24:21.819
crops, in the summer of '64 and
the fall of '64,

00:24:21.819 --> 00:24:24.644
and they're still planting in
the whole southern half of

00:24:24.644 --> 00:24:27.160
Georgia and the whole southern
half of Alabama,

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.960
by and large,
right on into 1865.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:38.280
But where you happen to be
geographically was the first

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:43.240
important factor of where and
how emancipation might occur,

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:48.039
in proximity particularly to
the armies.

00:24:48.039 --> 00:24:52.086
Now, a second factor that would
determine when and if slaves

00:24:52.086 --> 00:24:56.064
would be free was the character
of the slave society in any

00:24:56.064 --> 00:24:58.779
given region.
Were they in a densely

00:24:58.779 --> 00:25:03.216
populated slave region like the
Sea Islands, parts of the cotton

00:25:03.216 --> 00:25:07.169
belt?
Or were they in sparsely

00:25:07.169 --> 00:25:12.965
populated areas?
And again, it had to do with

00:25:12.965 --> 00:25:15.562
geography.
Were you in the Lower

00:25:15.562 --> 00:25:18.630
Mississippi Valley,
huge concentrations of slaves?

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:24.755
When Grant's forces move down
the Mississippi and eventually

00:25:24.755 --> 00:25:29.788
take Vicksburg by July 1863,
this entire region--in fact it

00:25:29.788 --> 00:25:32.089
is in the Lower Mississippi
Valley;

00:25:32.089 --> 00:25:34.015
this is why some people argue
that the war,

00:25:34.015 --> 00:25:36.400
the Civil War was really won
and lost in the West.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.586
And I'll engage that argument
after the break when we talk

00:25:39.586 --> 00:25:42.325
about Union victory and
Confederate defeat and the

00:25:42.325 --> 00:25:45.680
various debates among historians
trying to explain this.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.876
A lot of people have argued
that the war is won and lost in

00:25:48.876 --> 00:25:52.183
the West because of the great
significance of the Mississippi

00:25:52.183 --> 00:25:54.766
Valley,
which had become the great

00:25:54.766 --> 00:25:58.869
cotton kingdom of the world.
And when Union forces truly

00:25:58.869 --> 00:26:02.458
conquer the Mississippi River by
the summer of 1863,

00:26:02.458 --> 00:26:06.470
there are thousands of slaves
coming into Union lines.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:09.467
The reason that Grant and
Sherman and other officers in

00:26:09.467 --> 00:26:13.019
the West began to create these
things called contraband camps,

00:26:13.019 --> 00:26:15.535
for freed slaves,
is because they didn't know

00:26:15.535 --> 00:26:18.589
what to do with them.
And there are these amazing

00:26:18.589 --> 00:26:21.940
dispatches written by Grant,
to the War Department,

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.260
saying what am I going to do
with all these people,

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.210
how do I feed them,
where do I put them?

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.200
What is their status,
what are they legally?

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.063
And eventually that's why you
get the largest contraband camps

00:26:33.063 --> 00:26:35.138
anywhere.
The largest ones were not in

00:26:35.138 --> 00:26:37.943
Virginia--although there was a
huge one around Washington,

00:26:37.943 --> 00:26:40.995
DC--the largest of them were in
northern Mississippi at a place

00:26:40.995 --> 00:26:43.379
called Corinth.
You can see it on the map right

00:26:43.379 --> 00:26:45.276
here.
There was a huge contraband

00:26:45.276 --> 00:26:47.981
camp at Memphis.
There was eventually one in

00:26:47.981 --> 00:26:51.643
Cairo, Illinois.
All up and down this region,

00:26:51.643 --> 00:26:56.850
this is where conquest really
happened first and the true

00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:01.964
disruption of southern society
and the beginnings of the

00:27:01.964 --> 00:27:06.843
destruction of plantations.
It will lead even to the

00:27:06.843 --> 00:27:11.522
beginnings--it's going to take
another year for it to happen

00:27:11.522 --> 00:27:15.170
along the East Coast,
but it begins in '63;

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:19.150
even in '62 but especially
'63--where many plantation

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:23.208
owners in Louisiana and
Mississippi started refugeeing

00:27:23.208 --> 00:27:25.624
their slaves.
They would flee their

00:27:25.624 --> 00:27:27.958
plantations in the face of the
Yankee armies,

00:27:27.958 --> 00:27:31.518
often going west toward Texas,
sometimes just further inland,

00:27:31.518 --> 00:27:34.652
or wherever they could go,
and they would try to take

00:27:34.652 --> 00:27:38.200
their slaves with them;
it was called refugeeing them.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.711
And often what that meant--I'll
cite some examples of that after

00:27:41.711 --> 00:27:45.299
the break.
There's a famous diary memoir

00:27:45.299 --> 00:27:50.435
by a southern woman,
Kate Stone, who kept a diary of

00:27:50.435 --> 00:27:54.059
her plantation called
Brokenburn.

00:27:54.059 --> 00:27:56.390
At any rate,
she left with some

00:27:56.390 --> 00:28:00.894
hundred-and-some slaves to try
to get out of Louisiana over

00:28:00.894 --> 00:28:04.085
into Texas.
By the time she got there half

00:28:04.085 --> 00:28:07.259
of them were gone,
and she kept wondering why.

00:28:07.259 --> 00:28:14.069
Gee, why would they leave,
what happened to their loyalty?

00:28:14.069 --> 00:28:17.678
Then thirdly,
the third factor that would

00:28:17.678 --> 00:28:22.730
determine when and how and if a
slave became free was,

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:27.430
indeed, what policy was
actually being enforced,

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:31.730
at any given time,
by those Union troops,

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.339
or for that matter by the
Confederate troops in terms of

00:28:34.339 --> 00:28:36.569
freeing the slaves or not
freeing the slaves,

00:28:36.569 --> 00:28:40.063
taking them into their lines or
not taking them into their

00:28:40.063 --> 00:28:43.250
lines, and establishing some
kind of legal status.

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:48.858
And then the fourth factor,
of course--and this one you

00:28:48.858 --> 00:28:52.461
can't measure;
you can know it when you read

00:28:52.461 --> 00:28:56.008
it and you see it and you hear
it, and there's so many

00:28:56.008 --> 00:28:59.355
wonderful documents that
demonstrate it--the fourth

00:28:59.355 --> 00:29:03.572
factor in when and how American
slaves became free was their own

00:29:03.572 --> 00:29:06.011
ingenuity,
their own initiative,

00:29:06.011 --> 00:29:08.242
their own cunning,
their own bravery,

00:29:08.242 --> 00:29:10.970
their own willingness to risk
everything,

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:15.150
to try to get to something
called freedom.

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:19.012
And not knowing what that
freedom would be when they got

00:29:19.012 --> 00:29:23.109
there -- would they be employed?
Would they have shelter?

00:29:23.109 --> 00:29:25.170
Were they going to be able to
feed their children?

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:28.480
Could they get their wives and
husbands out with them?

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:33.225
What about women with three
children, where would they go,

00:29:33.225 --> 00:29:37.039
what would their status be?
Would they actually have any

00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:37.440
rights?

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:44.732
We learn so much about
this--and please in the reading

00:29:44.732 --> 00:29:48.951
packet have a close look.
I included some of those

00:29:48.951 --> 00:29:53.324
documents from the contraband
camps where these

00:29:53.324 --> 00:29:58.363
superintendents of the
contraband camps were all asked

00:29:58.363 --> 00:30:02.514
a series of questions.
They were asked things about

00:30:02.514 --> 00:30:05.740
the motives of the slaves that
escaped into their camps.

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:09.049
They were asked to describe why
had these people come.

00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:11.180
They were asked to describe
their physical conditions.

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.551
They were asked to describe
what they thought,

00:30:13.551 --> 00:30:15.289
what they felt,
what they said.

00:30:15.289 --> 00:30:20.559
And all these superintendents
of all these contraband camps

00:30:20.559 --> 00:30:25.829
are just stunned at the way that
black folk keep coming,

00:30:25.829 --> 00:30:29.280
in spite of the hardships,
half clothed,

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:33.052
half fed--if that.
And they're stunned at the

00:30:33.052 --> 00:30:37.059
religiosity of escaped slaves.
These superintendents write

00:30:37.059 --> 00:30:39.759
back and they say,
"These people sing and they

00:30:39.759 --> 00:30:41.920
worship all night
long--strange."

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.068
But almost to a man,
these superintendents of

00:30:45.068 --> 00:30:48.575
contraband camps when asked what
were the motives,

00:30:48.575 --> 00:30:52.440
they simply fall back on the
most basic of things.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:56.080
They say things like,
"They wanted their freedom."

00:31:01.859 --> 00:31:04.973
Now, emancipation also would
depend, here and there,

00:31:04.973 --> 00:31:07.049
on a whole lot of other
factors,

00:31:07.049 --> 00:31:11.274
but again they come under these
categories I've already given

00:31:11.274 --> 00:31:13.950
you--the close proximity to the
war.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:18.044
Now, for example,
when the war moved into Georgia

00:31:18.044 --> 00:31:21.797
in '63 and '64,
when Sherman invaded northern

00:31:21.797 --> 00:31:26.829
Georgia and the war really went
to the deep hinterland,

00:31:26.829 --> 00:31:30.029
the heart of the southeast,
Confederates were all

00:31:30.029 --> 00:31:33.630
ready--and they were already
doing this in Virginia,

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:36.776
they were beginning to do it
out in the West,

00:31:36.776 --> 00:31:41.138
they surely did it in the city
of Mobile and other Confederate

00:31:41.138 --> 00:31:45.500
held cities--Confederates had
begun to employ or impress their

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:49.029
slaves into service,
thousands of them.

00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:51.802
About 3000 slaves were put to
work in Mobile,

00:31:51.802 --> 00:31:54.259
Alabama, building its
fortifications.

00:31:54.259 --> 00:31:57.188
Slaves, hundreds upon hundreds
of slaves, were put to work

00:31:57.188 --> 00:31:59.140
building fortifications of
Richmond.

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:04.417
An estimated 5,000 slaves were
put to work building the

00:32:04.417 --> 00:32:08.913
fortifications all around
Atlanta, by late '63,

00:32:08.913 --> 00:32:12.530
to try to stop Sherman's
advance.

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:16.253
Very often they were hired out;
that is, they were supposed to

00:32:16.253 --> 00:32:19.428
be paid--or their owners were
supposed to be paid--for their

00:32:19.428 --> 00:32:21.997
service.
They were used as teamsters and

00:32:21.997 --> 00:32:26.016
nurses and cooks and boatmen and
blacksmiths and laundresses and

00:32:26.016 --> 00:32:29.090
so on and so forth.
If you saw a Confederate Army

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:31.624
from 1862 to '64,
you'd see hundreds of black

00:32:31.624 --> 00:32:32.200
people.

00:32:36.569 --> 00:32:40.685
Well, and as those armies
moved, sometimes those slaves

00:32:40.685 --> 00:32:45.424
had opportunities to flee.
In the wake of battles,

00:32:45.424 --> 00:32:50.519
on any scale,
some slaves would always flee.

00:32:50.519 --> 00:32:56.998
They were often used as the
burial crews,

00:32:56.998 --> 00:33:01.361
on both sides.
They were also hired out--and

00:33:01.361 --> 00:33:04.966
this was really significant in
Virginia--to the ironworks in

00:33:04.966 --> 00:33:07.389
Richmond.
The Tredagar Ironworks at one

00:33:07.389 --> 00:33:10.652
point employed almost 4,000
slaves who tended to be hired

00:33:10.652 --> 00:33:14.090
out from the western parts of
Massachusetts and the northern

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:17.804
parts of North Carolina.
That movement of people,

00:33:17.804 --> 00:33:21.348
movement of slaves,
on this scale had never

00:33:21.348 --> 00:33:25.228
happened in the South,
and in the midst of that

00:33:25.228 --> 00:33:28.237
movement.
Linda Morgan wrote a fine book

00:33:28.237 --> 00:33:31.892
on emancipation in Virginia and
she showed this for the first

00:33:31.892 --> 00:33:34.277
time,
that all this movement of hired

00:33:34.277 --> 00:33:37.400
out slaves to Richmond--and
other small ironworks,

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.446
by the way, over in the
Shenandoah Valley--meant a

00:33:40.446 --> 00:33:43.120
certain percentage of them began
to flee,

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:48.259
and escape, further north.
They worked on railroad crews.

00:33:48.259 --> 00:33:52.572
It was estimated that in
northern Georgia,

00:33:52.572 --> 00:33:57.200
during Sherman's campaign
against Atlanta,

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:01.459
that about forty percent of all
the women working as nurses in

00:34:01.459 --> 00:34:05.650
Confederate hospitals all over
the state were slave women.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:08.174
That means they'd been taken
off their plantations,

00:34:08.174 --> 00:34:09.992
their farms,
or out of their domestic

00:34:09.992 --> 00:34:11.728
situations,
wherever they were,

00:34:11.728 --> 00:34:13.480
and put to work in the
hospitals.

00:34:17.019 --> 00:34:20.866
So the point is,
movement of the armies meant

00:34:20.866 --> 00:34:25.849
movement of slaves as well,
and that moment of freedom,

00:34:25.849 --> 00:34:28.903
that moment of escape,
that opportunity might come

00:34:28.903 --> 00:34:33.332
when you would least expect it.
And that American slave had to

00:34:33.332 --> 00:34:36.653
make a choice,
every time--do I go and risk

00:34:36.653 --> 00:34:40.410
everything or do I not?
Let me tell one little story

00:34:40.410 --> 00:34:42.979
amidst that.
It's the other half of this

00:34:42.979 --> 00:34:47.892
book I just did.
This young slave named Wallace

00:34:47.892 --> 00:34:52.142
Turnage.
He was born on a little tobacco

00:34:52.142 --> 00:34:56.760
farm in North Carolina in 1846,
Green County,

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.244
North Carolina,
sold by his indebted owner to a

00:35:00.244 --> 00:35:04.260
Richmond, Virginia slave-trader
named Hector Davis,

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:07.458
who was one of the largest
slave-traders in the United

00:35:07.458 --> 00:35:09.570
States and kept enormous
records.

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:14.061
He spent about six months in
1860 working in the three-story

00:35:14.061 --> 00:35:17.030
slave jail/auction house in
Richmond.

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:20.624
His job every day was preparing
the slaves in what was called

00:35:20.624 --> 00:35:23.560
the dressing room,
to take them out to the auction

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.057
floor.
And one day he's simply told,

00:35:26.057 --> 00:35:29.839
"Boy, you're in the auction."
And he was sold to an Alabama

00:35:29.839 --> 00:35:32.159
cotton planter named James
Chalmers.

00:35:32.159 --> 00:35:35.597
Seventy-two hours later by
train he found himself on a huge

00:35:35.597 --> 00:35:37.789
cotton operation near
Pickensville,

00:35:37.789 --> 00:35:43.912
Alabama, which is right about
there, right on the Mississippi

00:35:43.912 --> 00:35:49.320
border, a plantation with about
eighty-five slaves.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.446
And the narrative he left us,
which was discovered and lopped

00:35:53.446 --> 00:35:57.663
into my lap a few years ago,
the extraordinary narrative he

00:35:57.663 --> 00:36:01.897
left, is the story largely of
his five attempts to escape in

00:36:01.897 --> 00:36:05.495
the midst of the war,
from the age of fourteen to

00:36:05.495 --> 00:36:07.370
seventeen.
He was one

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:12.476
passionate--half-crazy,
one might say--no doubt

00:36:12.476 --> 00:36:19.360
traumatized--teenage slave who
just couldn't be controlled.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:23.289
He ran away four times into
Mississippi, the second two of

00:36:23.289 --> 00:36:27.122
which, certainly at least,
he was always trying to get up

00:36:27.122 --> 00:36:30.420
to northern Mississippi to get
to the Union armies,

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:34.009
which he knew had controlled
the whole northern tier of

00:36:34.009 --> 00:36:37.644
Mississippi by late spring 1862;
in fact three of his escapes

00:36:37.644 --> 00:36:40.706
over there were really--.
He would always go up the

00:36:40.706 --> 00:36:44.174
Mobile and Ohio Railway Line.
And one time he was at large

00:36:44.174 --> 00:36:46.777
for four and a half months,
hiding in other slave cabins

00:36:46.777 --> 00:36:49.616
and hiding in woods and forests
and gullies wherever he could

00:36:49.616 --> 00:36:51.909
hide,
and he was always captured.

00:36:51.909 --> 00:36:55.153
He was trying to actually get
to Corinth, and the big

00:36:55.153 --> 00:36:58.584
contraband camp in Corinth,
and he almost made it on his

00:36:58.584 --> 00:37:02.305
fourth try.
He kept being captured by slave

00:37:02.305 --> 00:37:05.900
patrols, Confederate patrols and
so on.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:10.458
His master would always come
after him because he was so

00:37:10.458 --> 00:37:12.219
valuable.
He'd been sold,

00:37:12.219 --> 00:37:15.619
by the way, for $950 the first
time, out of North Carolina.

00:37:15.619 --> 00:37:18.849
He was sold for $1000 to old
Chalmers in Richmond.

00:37:18.849 --> 00:37:23.498
And Chalmers now got fed up in
early '63 of constantly trying

00:37:23.498 --> 00:37:27.600
to retrieve this kid,
and he took him down to Mobile,

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.643
Alabama and sold him at the
slave jail in Mobile in the

00:37:31.643 --> 00:37:37.226
spring of 1863 for $2000.
That's about the price today of

00:37:37.226 --> 00:37:41.059
a good Mercedes-Benz;
well as opposed to a bad

00:37:41.059 --> 00:37:43.440
Mercedes-Benz,
I'm not sure what that would

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:43.780
be.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:51.570
And Wallace's fifth and final
escape attempt,

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:55.170
the one that succeeded,
came after a vicious beating.

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:58.440
He'd been beaten many more
times than he could count and

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:02.186
he'd been put in neck braces and
leg chains and ankle chains and

00:38:02.186 --> 00:38:05.694
wrist chains and every kind
of--he'd experienced about every

00:38:05.694 --> 00:38:09.440
kind of brutality slavery could
wreak upon a teenage kid.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:13.619
One day, he crashed his
master's carriage and the master

00:38:13.619 --> 00:38:17.420
got so angry that he took him to
the slave jail,

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:21.356
hired the jailer to give him
thirty lashes with the ugliest

00:38:21.356 --> 00:38:24.342
whip they had,
this contraption they had that

00:38:24.342 --> 00:38:26.989
would make you bleed on every
lash.

00:38:26.989 --> 00:38:29.687
At the end of it he's standing
there naked, bleeding,

00:38:29.687 --> 00:38:31.400
and his master says,
"Go home."

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.351
And instead of going home he
put his clothes back on and he

00:38:34.351 --> 00:38:36.590
walked right through the
Confederate Army,

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:40.017
a garrison of 10,000 troops,
where he was no doubt simply

00:38:40.017 --> 00:38:42.650
mistaken for yet another black
camp hand,

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:46.398
and at dusk he just crossed
through the Confederate camp and

00:38:46.398 --> 00:38:50.618
he walked out of Mobile.
And his final escape is a

00:38:50.618 --> 00:38:55.447
three-week trek,
which he narrates in remarkable

00:38:55.447 --> 00:38:57.844
ways,
a three-week trek down the

00:38:57.844 --> 00:39:01.358
western shore of Mobile Bay for
twenty-five miles through a

00:39:01.358 --> 00:39:03.659
snake and alligator invested
swamp,

00:39:03.659 --> 00:39:06.769
now known as the Fowl River
Estuary.

00:39:06.769 --> 00:39:09.742
I've been there,
I've seen the alligators and

00:39:09.742 --> 00:39:12.310
the snakes, from a large ferry
boat.

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:18.422
And he describes one day
praying especially hard when he

00:39:18.422 --> 00:39:20.199
got out to the tip of Mobile
Bay,

00:39:20.199 --> 00:39:23.355
and the tide brought in an old
rickety rowboat,

00:39:23.355 --> 00:39:27.417
and he tipped over the rowboat,
took a plank of wood and he

00:39:27.417 --> 00:39:30.079
just started rowing out into the
ocean.

00:39:30.079 --> 00:39:33.644
And in quite dramatic form
he--which is no doubt a little

00:39:33.644 --> 00:39:37.271
embellished--he describes how a
wave is about to swamp his

00:39:37.271 --> 00:39:39.900
little boat,
and he hears oars,

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:44.730
and the oars were a Union
gunboat with eight sailors.

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:47.360
They said, "Jump in."
He jumped in.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:52.395
And he said as he sat down in
their boat, he said the Yankee

00:39:52.395 --> 00:39:57.260
sailors were struck with silence
as they looked at him.

00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:00.668
And I don't know if that's true
or not, but I don't doubt it,

00:40:00.668 --> 00:40:04.019
they probably were struck with
silence, wondering who he was

00:40:04.019 --> 00:40:07.395
and how he got there.
They took him to a Sand Island

00:40:07.395 --> 00:40:11.111
fort and clothed him and fed
him, the first kind acts by a

00:40:11.111 --> 00:40:14.501
white person that seventeen
year-old Turnage had ever

00:40:14.501 --> 00:40:17.241
experienced.
And the next day they took him

00:40:17.241 --> 00:40:20.070
to Fort Gaines on Dauphin
Island, which is the big,

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:23.352
beautiful sandbar island out at
the mouth of Mobile Bay,

00:40:23.352 --> 00:40:26.994
and he was brought before the
Union commander of all forces in

00:40:26.994 --> 00:40:28.702
the area,
Gordon Granger,

00:40:28.702 --> 00:40:31.747
who interrogated him,
probably because they wanted

00:40:31.747 --> 00:40:35.913
intelligence about Mobile,
and Granger gave him two

00:40:35.913 --> 00:40:38.719
choices.
He could either join a black

00:40:38.719 --> 00:40:42.834
regiment that they were forming
at that very time in the Gulf

00:40:42.834 --> 00:40:46.880
region, or he could become a
servant to a white officer.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:51.838
And Wallace chose the latter;
didn't tell us why but probably

00:40:51.838 --> 00:40:55.099
because he'd had enough
suffering.

00:40:55.099 --> 00:41:00.429
He'd seen enough of his own war
with the Confederates.

00:41:00.429 --> 00:41:04.752
And he served out the war for
another year as the mess cook

00:41:04.752 --> 00:41:09.150
for a captain from a Maryland
regiment whose name was Junius

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:11.841
Turner.
And Wallace was with that

00:41:11.841 --> 00:41:15.808
regiment in Baltimore,
Maryland in August of 1865 when

00:41:15.808 --> 00:41:19.252
it was mustered out.
He lived three years in

00:41:19.252 --> 00:41:23.672
Baltimore and then moved to New
York City where he lived the

00:41:23.672 --> 00:41:26.070
rest of his life,
until 1916.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:30.641
But by 1870 I found him in a
census manuscript living in the

00:41:30.641 --> 00:41:35.290
300-block of Thompson Street in
what you and I call Greenwich

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:37.937
Village.
He got his mother,

00:41:37.937 --> 00:41:42.611
his four siblings,
somehow, out of North Carolina,

00:41:42.611 --> 00:41:47.190
and they were all living in a
tenement house,

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:52.459
surviving, as part of the first
generation of a black working

00:41:52.459 --> 00:41:56.860
class, former slaves,
in a northern city.

00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:00.764
He lived till 1916.
He's buried in Cyprus Hill

00:42:00.764 --> 00:42:02.800
Cemetery in Brooklyn,
New York.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:07.214
The point of all of that is
that these slaves escaping were

00:42:07.214 --> 00:42:10.335
real people, with real names,
real family,

00:42:10.335 --> 00:42:14.993
real hopes and desires.
And those who--some of those

00:42:14.993 --> 00:42:18.340
who survived told us what it
meant.

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:24.277
Now, the war,
of course, raged on,

00:42:24.277 --> 00:42:32.734
and at the end of the day--this
is a photograph,

00:42:32.734 --> 00:42:42.449
by the way, taken in 1862,
I believe, in Virginia.

00:42:42.449 --> 00:42:46.780
The photographer simply called
it "A Group of Contrabands."

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:54.014
The war raged on.
And of course in the spring of

00:42:54.014 --> 00:42:58.239
1863 the Union armies will
invade Virginia again.

00:42:58.239 --> 00:43:02.999
I'll come back to lots of this
after the break when we get back

00:43:02.999 --> 00:43:07.605
to the military history and try
to explain how the Union side

00:43:07.605 --> 00:43:11.245
won this war.
They'll fight a horrible battle

00:43:11.245 --> 00:43:13.807
at a place called
Chancellorsville,

00:43:13.807 --> 00:43:16.670
near Fredericksburg in May of
1863,

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:20.359
which will be another smashing
victory by Robert E.

00:43:20.359 --> 00:43:24.491
Lee and Stonewall Jackson,
over a Union Army commanded by

00:43:24.491 --> 00:43:28.835
Joseph Hooker.
It will give Lee his occasion

00:43:28.835 --> 00:43:34.969
for his second invasion of the
North, the riskiest of all,

00:43:34.969 --> 00:43:37.459
which will lead him up through
northern Virginia,

00:43:37.459 --> 00:43:40.052
across into Maryland,
and eventually all the way in

00:43:40.052 --> 00:43:42.822
to Pennsylvania,
and will lead to the fateful

00:43:42.822 --> 00:43:45.915
battle at Gettysburg,
the first three days of July,

00:43:45.915 --> 00:43:48.626
1863;
arguably the most important

00:43:48.626 --> 00:43:51.500
military turning point of the
war.

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:55.615
But it is in those same first
six and seven months of 1863

00:43:55.615 --> 00:43:59.298
that this war has now been
transformed into a war of

00:43:59.298 --> 00:44:04.406
unconditional surrender,
a war of all out attempt,

00:44:04.406 --> 00:44:11.568
at least, all out mobilization
at home, and conquest in the

00:44:11.568 --> 00:44:14.500
South.
It is during this period that

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.760
black soldiers are being
recruited.

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.155
The 54^(th) Massachusetts,
the famous regiment from

00:44:19.155 --> 00:44:22.030
Massachusetts about which the
movie Glory was made,

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:27.124
was recruited that winter,
and spring, of course,

00:44:27.124 --> 00:44:32.854
and marched off to South
Carolina to its fate in May of

00:44:32.854 --> 00:44:36.641
1863.
They will reach their fate at

00:44:36.641 --> 00:44:42.501
Fort Wagner within a week of the
Battle of Gettysburg back up

00:44:42.501 --> 00:44:45.730
north.
But just as a way to take this

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:49.178
out today, go back with me to
January 1^(st),

00:44:49.178 --> 00:44:53.958
1863, the day the Emancipation
Proclamation actually went into

00:44:53.958 --> 00:44:56.615
place.
I said at the outset that for

00:44:56.615 --> 00:45:00.206
most black folk they didn't
really care about what actually

00:45:00.206 --> 00:45:03.239
the details or the words of the
document were.

00:45:03.239 --> 00:45:08.346
The point was that now somehow
the United States government was

00:45:08.346 --> 00:45:10.570
sanctioning emancipation.

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:18.699
And go back with me to Thomas
Wentworth Higginson.

00:45:18.699 --> 00:45:22.809
This is Higginson's description
of Emancipation Day.

00:45:22.809 --> 00:45:26.354
On Hilton Head Island,
in South Carolina,

00:45:26.354 --> 00:45:28.924
near Beaufort,
South Carolina,

00:45:28.924 --> 00:45:34.507
he was given orders to read the
Emancipation Proclamation to the

00:45:34.507 --> 00:45:37.809
people,
to the freedmen.

00:45:37.809 --> 00:45:40.511
And this, by the way,
became a policy throughout the

00:45:40.511 --> 00:45:42.524
Union Army.
Thousands of copies of the

00:45:42.524 --> 00:45:45.681
Emancipation Proclamation were
given to Union officers who were

00:45:45.681 --> 00:45:47.769
ordered to spread it around the
South.

00:45:47.769 --> 00:45:51.070
Higginson not only spread it,
he held a ceremony.

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:56.346
They build a little stage.
And this is his description of

00:45:56.346 --> 00:45:59.612
what happened.
He's describing the scene:

00:45:59.612 --> 00:46:04.610
"All this was according to the
program," writes Higginson.

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:08.485
"Then followed an incident so
simple and so touching,

00:46:08.485 --> 00:46:12.509
so utterly unexpected and
startling that I can scarcely

00:46:12.509 --> 00:46:17.239
believe it on recalling it,
though it gave the key note to

00:46:17.239 --> 00:46:20.918
the whole day.
The very moment the speaker had

00:46:20.918 --> 00:46:24.659
ceased, and just as I took and
waved the flag,

00:46:24.659 --> 00:46:28.988
which now for the first time
meant anything to these poor

00:46:28.988 --> 00:46:33.239
people, there suddenly arose
close beside the platform a

00:46:33.239 --> 00:46:36.690
strong male voice,
but a little cracked and

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:40.920
elderly, into which two women's
voices instantly blended,

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:46.241
singing, as if by an impulse
that could no more be repressed

00:46:46.241 --> 00:46:50.030
than the morning note of a song
sparrow.

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:55.301
'My country 'tis of thee,
sweet land of liberty,

00:46:55.301 --> 00:46:59.528
of thee I sing.'
People looked at each other,

00:46:59.528 --> 00:47:03.710
and then at us on the platform
to see whence came this

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:07.260
interruption,
not put down in the program.

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:11.534
Firmly and irrepressibly the
quavering voices sang on,

00:47:11.534 --> 00:47:15.002
verse after verse,
'my country 'tis of thee,

00:47:15.002 --> 00:47:18.824
sweet land of liberty.'
Others of the colored people

00:47:18.824 --> 00:47:20.781
joined in.
Some whites on the platform

00:47:20.781 --> 00:47:22.920
began, but I motioned to them to
be silent.

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.910
I never saw anything so
electric.

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:31.614
It made all words cheap.
It seemed the choked voice of a

00:47:31.614 --> 00:47:34.596
race at last unloosed.
Nothing could be more

00:47:34.596 --> 00:47:38.840
wonderfully unconscious.
Art could not have dreamed of a

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:43.840
tribute to the day of jubilee;
it should be so affecting.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:48.370
History will not believe it.
And when I came to speak of it,

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:51.590
after it was ended,
tears were everywhere.

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:57.780
If you could've heard how
quaint and innocent it all was.

00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:00.857
Just think of it,
the first day they'd ever had a

00:48:00.857 --> 00:48:04.320
country, the first flag they'd
ever seen which promised

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:08.314
anything to their people.
And here, while mere spectators

00:48:08.314 --> 00:48:11.550
stood in silence,
waiting for my stupid words,

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:16.994
these simple souls burst out in
their way, as if they were by

00:48:16.994 --> 00:48:20.900
their own hearths,
at home.

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:25.568
When they stopped there was
nothing to do but to try to

00:48:25.568 --> 00:48:28.170
speak.
And I went on.

00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:35.122
But the life of that whole day
was in those unknown people's

00:48:35.122 --> 00:48:39.000
simple song."
Have a good spring break.

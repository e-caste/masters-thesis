00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:06.177
Well, last time looking at the
household provided a point of

00:00:06.177 --> 00:00:10.416
entry to some of the basic
realities and priorities that

00:00:10.416 --> 00:00:15.040
shape people's lives at the most
basic level in the sixteenth

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.120
century.
 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.489
But as is already apparent,
I hope, these households of

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:23.240
course didn't live in isolation.
 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.965
On the contrary,
every family was conducting its

00:00:26.965 --> 00:00:31.166
affairs in the context of a
larger landscape of social

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:35.335
institutions and relationships,
and what I want to do this

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:38.270
week, in concluding the sort of
contextual introduction,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.061
is to talk about some of these
connections that bound people

00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:44.760
together and bound the country
together.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.253
And I'll start by looking at
some of the more localized

00:00:49.253 --> 00:00:54.413
institutions and relationships,
those which bound them together

00:00:54.413 --> 00:00:56.660
into local communities.
 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.270
But as soon as I use that word,
"community,"

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.620
I have to pause because it's a
very loaded term.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.399
Its use tends to beg an
important question about society

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:11.790
in the period.
 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.896
Put simply, people in
sixteenth-century England didn't

00:01:15.896 --> 00:01:18.840
live in entities called
communities.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.998
They lived in places they
described as manors or parishes,

00:01:23.998 --> 00:01:26.170
villages or townships.
 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.485
They very rarely used the term
"community"

00:01:29.485 --> 00:01:30.069
at all.
 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:33.890
When we talk about communities,
as we often do,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.733
we're actually introducing a
concept which is largely a

00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:42.680
construct of sociologists and
historians,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.404
and more than that we're also
implying something about the

00:01:47.404 --> 00:01:51.881
nature and the quality of the
social relationships that

00:01:51.881 --> 00:01:56.025
existed in the manors and
parishes and villages and

00:01:56.025 --> 00:01:59.010
townships of the distant past.
 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.814
The very word
"community"

00:02:02.814 --> 00:02:06.510
carries a great deal of warmth.
 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.675
It's a good word to co-opt in
the cause of any argument as we

00:02:11.675 --> 00:02:14.688
see constantly in political
life.

00:02:14.688 --> 00:02:18.500
It vibrates with a certain
moral resonance,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.378
and when that term gets adopted
by historians and sociologists

00:02:23.378 --> 00:02:28.098
it often also invokes a certain
nostalgia about the past.

00:02:28.098 --> 00:02:32.155
Community always seems to be
just out of reach,

00:02:32.155 --> 00:02:36.740
something that belongs to a
generation or two ago;

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.800
just over the hill;
in decline or under threat.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.008
It's sort of the before of
which we are the after;

00:02:45.008 --> 00:02:49.596
tantalizing,
warm, the attractive feature of

00:02:49.596 --> 00:02:52.050
a world we have lost.
 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.330
And that shouldn't surprise us.
 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.238
The very term
"community"

00:02:57.238 --> 00:03:02.542
has very old roots derived from
the Latin and meaning literally

00:03:02.542 --> 00:03:05.280
the quality of being at one.
 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.037
But the concept as it was
developed by nineteenth- and

00:03:09.037 --> 00:03:13.078
twentieth-century sociologists
was often used by them as a

00:03:13.078 --> 00:03:16.340
point of reference from which to
examine,

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.937
and often to judge,
the rapid social changes taking

00:03:20.937 --> 00:03:22.870
place at that time.
 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.812
So the traditional or the folk
community was very commonly

00:03:27.812 --> 00:03:33.276
envisaged by the founders of the
social sciences as being almost

00:03:33.276 --> 00:03:38.739
everything that modern European
and American society was ceasing

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:39.780
to be.
 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.349
It's rural.
 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.099
It's small scale.
 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.788
It's economically simple.
 

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:52.702
It's introverted and deeply
rooted and warm and personal and

00:03:52.702 --> 00:03:56.919
homogeneous in values and
stable--

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.317
embodying indeed,
one could say,

00:03:59.317 --> 00:04:03.030
some of the traditions of
pastoral literature.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.674
I don't know if you know Thomas
Gray's eighteenth-century poem

00:04:06.674 --> 00:04:09.363
the "Elegy in a Country
Churchyard,"

00:04:09.363 --> 00:04:12.650
but it's a good example of that
kind of literature.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.163
Gray envisaged what he called
the "rude Forefathers of

00:04:16.163 --> 00:04:18.829
the hamlet"
buried in the churchyard.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.252
He described them as having
bent themselves to "useful

00:04:22.252 --> 00:04:24.730
toil" and "homely
joys",

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.206
"far from the madding
crowd," living in a

00:04:27.206 --> 00:04:30.060
"cool,
sequester'd vale of life."

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.533
These are all phrases from the
poem, many of which have become

00:04:34.533 --> 00:04:35.560
widely used.
 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.550
Okay.
 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.855
Well, it's easy to appreciate
why historians exposed to that

00:04:40.855 --> 00:04:45.305
long tradition of thinking about
small communities in the past

00:04:45.305 --> 00:04:49.538
are sometimes apt to imagine the
past and to assume certain

00:04:49.538 --> 00:04:53.916
things about the quality of life
in the past in those morally

00:04:53.916 --> 00:04:55.449
loaded terms.
 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.160
To one historian,
for example,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.579
the late fifteenth- and early
sixteenth-century village was

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:03.045
like--
he describes it as--"a

00:05:03.045 --> 00:05:06.800
family embracing and composed of
many families."

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.980
Another describes how,
to quote him,

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.975
"the unchanging
traditional life of the peasant

00:05:13.975 --> 00:05:18.125
system flowed on uninterrupted
like a deep underground

00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:19.379
river."
 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:22.742
It had flowed thus for a
thousand years and it

00:05:22.742 --> 00:05:27.300
"would continue to flow for
another two hundred."

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.482
Now in contrast you get some
historians who react violently

00:05:31.482 --> 00:05:35.303
against what they see as a
sentimentalization of these

00:05:35.303 --> 00:05:36.889
rural communities.
 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.930
One in particular has described
a Tudor village as being,

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.485
to quote him,
"a place filled with

00:05:43.485 --> 00:05:47.223
malice and hatred,
its only unifying bond being

00:05:47.223 --> 00:05:51.153
the occasional episode of mass
hysteria which temporarily bound

00:05:51.153 --> 00:05:55.081
together the majority in order
to harry and persecute the local

00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:56.160
witch."
 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.427
So that's how he sees it,
but both of these positions

00:06:00.427 --> 00:06:04.259
derive from a concept,
the concept of community,

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.175
which is so emotionally
powerful that it tends to seduce

00:06:08.175 --> 00:06:12.377
some scholars into a kind of
sentimentality and on the other

00:06:12.377 --> 00:06:16.791
hand it enrages others into an
equally distorted cynicism about

00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:18.430
human relations.
 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.468
Some have suggested that it
might be better if we just

00:06:21.468 --> 00:06:24.220
stopped talking about
communities altogether,

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.949
but to do that would surely be
to throw out the baby with the

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:31.064
bath water,
because the concept of

00:06:31.064 --> 00:06:34.940
community is very hard to do
without.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.127
It does describe a certain
aspect of social relationships

00:06:40.127 --> 00:06:45.129
in local society which is not
just a nostalgic myth;

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:49.413
a certain intensity of
connectedness amongst people

00:06:49.413 --> 00:06:52.670
focused on their local
institutions;

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.240
certain qualities of
recognition of one another,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.886
of reciprocity in relationships
with one another,

00:06:59.886 --> 00:07:02.240
of mutuality,
of identification,

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.759
of obligation.
 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:06.846
As historians,
we mustn't assume uncritically

00:07:06.846 --> 00:07:10.848
that particular settlements or
localities in the past were

00:07:10.848 --> 00:07:14.706
communities in the classical
sense with all the positive

00:07:14.706 --> 00:07:19.410
characteristics traditionally
believed to go along with them.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.819
Community isn't a thing or a
place.

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:26.009
It's a quality of living.
 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:27.790
It varies.
 

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.040
It's not always present.
 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.089
It waxes and wanes over time.
 

00:07:33.089 --> 00:07:34.930
It's subject to change.
 

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.892
It exists in different forms
and it doesn't simply,

00:07:38.892 --> 00:07:41.430
of course, belong to the past.
 

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.829
It's a perennial aspect of the
human situation,

00:07:45.829 --> 00:07:49.923
but if you want to consider it
in the past then we can best do

00:07:49.923 --> 00:07:53.750
so by trying to carefully
reconstruct the actual ties,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.069
institutional and personal,
that linked people together,

00:07:57.069 --> 00:08:00.680
the ties through which they
mapped out their social world,

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.730
so to speak;
the ties through which they

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.720
made it legible and
understandable.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:13.305
Well, such relationships and
the institutions that embodied

00:08:13.305 --> 00:08:19.276
them could be thought of as the
connective tissue of society at

00:08:19.276 --> 00:08:24.379
the most basic level and they
were of many kinds.

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:27.250
Some were relationships of
authority.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:33.073
We've already encountered these
in a social order imagined in

00:08:33.073 --> 00:08:39.190
terms of hierarchical ties of
obligation and differentiation.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.769
In rural society,
more broadly,

00:08:41.769 --> 00:08:47.188
the basic defining relationship
was a relationship of authority,

00:08:47.188 --> 00:08:51.058
the relationship of lordship
and tenancy.

00:08:51.058 --> 00:08:53.976
You can imagine
sixteenth-century England as

00:08:53.976 --> 00:08:56.960
being like a myriad of small
settlements,

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.580
most of them of less than 500
people,

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:04.240
scattered over a landscape of
considerable diversity.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.056
In the early sixteenth century
that landscape hadn't even been

00:09:08.056 --> 00:09:08.620
mapped.
 

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.926
The first county maps,
which county by county

00:09:12.926 --> 00:09:18.601
attempted to survey and map
England, were actually produced

00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:21.928
by Christopher Saxton in 1576.
 

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:25.610
It was such an important
publication that as the maps

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:30.001
were pulled from the press some
of them were taken still wet to

00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:33.330
Elizabeth I's chief minister
Lord Burghley.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.700
He saw the political potential
of having accurate maps of the

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.330
country for the first time.
 

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:42.668
But in the early sixteenth
century they didn't yet exist.

00:09:42.668 --> 00:09:45.946
Nonetheless,
the landscape was mapped and

00:09:45.946 --> 00:09:50.860
structured in another sense by
the realities of lordship,

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:57.240
the possession of the land and
the authority over tenants that

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.808
went with it.
 

00:09:58.808 --> 00:10:03.340
So, late medieval,
early sixteenth-century,

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:07.291
social organization was
inscribed on the land through

00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:11.926
lordship and the characteristic
unit of lordship was what they

00:10:11.926 --> 00:10:16.768
called the 'manor',
a unit of land under the

00:10:16.768 --> 00:10:19.408
authority of a lord.
 

00:10:19.408 --> 00:10:23.195
Some lords held only a single
manor, the petty gentlemen of

00:10:23.195 --> 00:10:24.370
the countryside.
 

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.389
Some of them held many.
 

00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:28.083
One for example,
Lord Berkeley,

00:10:28.083 --> 00:10:30.740
which is spelled Berkeley as in
our college,

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.870
pronounced "Barkley"
in England,

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.557
Lord Berkeley owned so much of
the county of Gloucestershire

00:10:36.557 --> 00:10:40.245
down here that he was described
by one contemporary as being

00:10:40.245 --> 00:10:43.808
"embowelled into the soil
of that country."

00:10:43.808 --> 00:10:46.750
But whatever the case,
whether their land holdings

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:50.129
were small or great,
the fact of lordship over

00:10:50.129 --> 00:10:54.769
manors was fundamental to the
structure of local society.

00:10:54.769 --> 00:10:59.594
The people who cultivated the
land usually did so as tenants

00:10:59.594 --> 00:11:03.514
of such manorial lords,
and the forms in terms of their

00:11:03.514 --> 00:11:06.815
tenancies determined their
relationship to their lords and

00:11:06.815 --> 00:11:10.000
in many respects their
relationships to one another.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.676
Now these forms of tenancy were
many and varied but there were

00:11:15.676 --> 00:11:17.908
some general patterns.
 

00:11:17.908 --> 00:11:20.591
The terminology is a little
tricky so I've put all the

00:11:20.591 --> 00:11:22.110
definitions on your handout.
 

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.533
You've probably got more
definitions of sixteenth-century

00:11:25.533 --> 00:11:29.139
land ownership and land holding
than you will ever need,

00:11:29.139 --> 00:11:32.928
but they're down there in case
you ever want to refer to them.

00:11:32.928 --> 00:11:37.120
Basically, each manor was
divided into what was described

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.639
as the demesne land and what was
tenant land.

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:44.378
If you look at your handout,
there's a map there of the

00:11:44.378 --> 00:11:46.940
manor of Laxton in
Nottinghamshire.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:50.779
That's almost right in the
center of England.

00:11:50.779 --> 00:11:55.104
And you'll see on one side at
the top the demesne land and the

00:11:55.104 --> 00:11:59.216
village and then around it the
great fields of the manor in

00:11:59.216 --> 00:12:01.909
which the tenants held their
land;

00:12:01.909 --> 00:12:05.038
the demesne and the tenant land.
 

00:12:05.038 --> 00:12:09.004
Demesne land in the Middle Ages
had been mostly cultivated by

00:12:09.004 --> 00:12:11.866
serf labor,
that's to say the labor of

00:12:11.866 --> 00:12:16.113
tenants who were not free and
who held their land from the

00:12:16.113 --> 00:12:19.690
lord in return for labor service
on his land.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.928
By 1500, serfdom had died out
in most parts of England.

00:12:23.928 --> 00:12:25.879
It died out in the course of
the late fourteenth and

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:29.340
fifteenth centuries,
still left to some extent over

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:33.470
in parts of East Anglia but it
was mostly gone.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:38.523
By 1500, the demesne land
tended to be let out by lords in

00:12:38.523 --> 00:12:41.360
large units to yeoman farmers.
 

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.182
As for the tenant land,
some of it was held by

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:50.788
freehold, probably about a fifth
overall.

00:12:50.788 --> 00:12:55.110
A freeholder owned his land,
he could leave it in his will,

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.481
he could sell it,
but he owed the duty of

00:12:58.481 --> 00:13:02.950
'recognition of lordship' to the
lord of the manor;

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:07.918
he had to pay a small annual
sum to recognize such lordship.

00:13:07.918 --> 00:13:11.052
Most tenants,
however, held their land by

00:13:11.052 --> 00:13:14.418
what was described as 'customary
tenure'.

00:13:14.418 --> 00:13:18.542
That's to say the land was
granted out to them in the court

00:13:18.542 --> 00:13:21.333
of the manor,
which would meet two or three

00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:23.442
times a year,
and they held it on terms

00:13:23.442 --> 00:13:25.950
"according to the custom of
the manor".

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.259
"According to the custom
of the manor";

00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:31.700
that's a phrase that's often
used.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.700
The custom of the manor laid
down their terms.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.917
These customary tenants were
usually described as

00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:39.658
"copyholders".
 

00:13:39.658 --> 00:13:42.804
They held their land according
to a copy of an entry in the

00:13:42.804 --> 00:13:46.330
records of the manor court which
was given to them as a record.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.095
Sometimes if you go back
through the deeds of a very old

00:13:50.095 --> 00:13:53.115
house you will find,
by the time you get back to

00:13:53.115 --> 00:13:55.308
sixteenth- and fifteenth-century
deeds,

00:13:55.308 --> 00:13:59.557
a little strip of parchment
which is actually a copy of the

00:13:59.557 --> 00:14:03.880
original grant of the land on
which that house is built to a

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.980
copyholder.
 

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:05.899
Okay.
 

00:14:05.899 --> 00:14:09.009
Copyholders paid a down payment
to their lord called a fine.

00:14:09.009 --> 00:14:11.178
They paid an annual rent.
 

00:14:11.178 --> 00:14:15.168
They might hold their land for
a period of years like a modern

00:14:15.168 --> 00:14:18.570
lease or they might hold it for
a period of lives.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:22.235
That was a customary form by
which you would take land for

00:14:22.235 --> 00:14:25.256
the life of yourself,
your wife, and your eldest

00:14:25.256 --> 00:14:25.899
child.
 

00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:29.023
The terms on which they held
their land might be fixed

00:14:29.023 --> 00:14:31.379
according to the custom of the
manor,

00:14:31.379 --> 00:14:33.490
in which case they were usually
very fortunate,

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:37.751
or they might be 'arbitrary';
that's to say they could be

00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:38.548
changed.
 

00:14:38.548 --> 00:14:41.885
So lordship and the
relationship between lords and

00:14:41.885 --> 00:14:45.086
tenants was a defining
relationship in any rural

00:14:45.086 --> 00:14:46.038
community.
 

00:14:46.038 --> 00:14:51.408
It created a local map of
rights and of obligations.

00:14:51.408 --> 00:14:55.302
The particular pattern
represented usually a particular

00:14:55.302 --> 00:14:59.697
local working out of a kind of
accommodation between the power

00:14:59.697 --> 00:15:04.600
of the lord and what his tenants
had been able to win with him--

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.928
win from him--or negotiate with
him,

00:15:06.928 --> 00:15:14.808
and those terms were enshrined
in their local custom.

00:15:14.808 --> 00:15:19.601
So, given those realities,
custom, and the notion of

00:15:19.601 --> 00:15:24.298
custom, not surprisingly,
is another keyword of the

00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:27.678
period, a very important notion.
 

00:15:27.678 --> 00:15:33.020
Custom, a word they use
constantly, was an accumulation

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.110
of rules.
 

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:38.047
An accumulation of rules about
what was considered to be right

00:15:38.047 --> 00:15:42.048
and proper in a particular place
and the correct procedures for

00:15:42.048 --> 00:15:44.759
maintaining and enforcing those
rules.

00:15:44.759 --> 00:15:46.928
Custom laid down,
as I've already said,

00:15:46.928 --> 00:15:50.125
the respective rights of the
lord and the tenant over the

00:15:50.125 --> 00:15:50.639
land.
 

00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:54.741
It also laid down the rules for
the use of the common grazing

00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:56.110
land of the manor.
 

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:59.678
It laid down the rules for the
settlement of disputes if they

00:15:59.678 --> 00:16:03.246
arose between the tenants of the
manor or between tenants and

00:16:03.246 --> 00:16:04.139
their lord.
 

00:16:04.139 --> 00:16:08.739
It's been described as a
lived-in environment of

00:16:08.739 --> 00:16:13.730
expectations which had grown up
slowly over time.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:18.101
Generally, people tended to
argue when there was any dispute

00:16:18.101 --> 00:16:21.731
that customs had existed
"time out of mind of

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:23.952
man";
that's another phrase that's

00:16:23.952 --> 00:16:24.460
often used.
 

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.078
Custom had governed their rules
in that locality "time out

00:16:28.078 --> 00:16:31.019
of mind of man",
and when there was a dispute

00:16:31.019 --> 00:16:34.101
they usually recruited the
oldest tenants they could find

00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:37.403
in order to pronounce on what
they had known throughout their

00:16:37.403 --> 00:16:40.773
sixty or seventy years of life,
on what they'd heard from their

00:16:40.773 --> 00:16:45.232
fathers or their grandfathers,
and so on to confirm the

00:16:45.232 --> 00:16:46.389
customs.
 

00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:48.863
In practice,
in fact, custom could be

00:16:48.863 --> 00:16:49.548
changed.
 

00:16:49.548 --> 00:16:54.042
It was subject to gradual
modification over time if all

00:16:54.042 --> 00:16:59.033
the tenants consented and it was
malleable in accordance with

00:16:59.033 --> 00:17:01.278
changing circumstances.
 

00:17:01.278 --> 00:17:06.251
Nevertheless,
it carried this aura of

00:17:06.251 --> 00:17:07.910
antiquity.
 

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.659
So at any one time the
operative custom in a particular

00:17:11.659 --> 00:17:15.548
place was the outcome of a kind
of adjustment amongst the

00:17:15.548 --> 00:17:19.088
tenants and between the tenants
and their lord.

00:17:19.088 --> 00:17:23.311
To this extent custom was seen
as being essentially the

00:17:23.311 --> 00:17:26.048
property of the tenant
community.

00:17:26.048 --> 00:17:30.868
It presupposed a community of
interest amongst them,

00:17:30.868 --> 00:17:34.513
and it set the pattern of
expectations that provided the

00:17:34.513 --> 00:17:38.223
criteria for judging their
relationships with one another

00:17:38.223 --> 00:17:41.140
and their relationships with
their lord.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.385
Was that relationship with
their lord equitable and

00:17:44.385 --> 00:17:46.529
legitimate according to custom?
 

00:17:46.529 --> 00:17:48.390
The word they often used was
"reasonable."

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:49.788
Was it reasonable?
 

00:17:49.788 --> 00:17:53.906
Was it maintaining custom or,
on the other hand,

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:57.848
was it becoming oppressive or
exploitative?

00:17:57.848 --> 00:18:01.720
And as a result of all of this,
in times of economic stress,

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.868
such as were to come later in
the sixteenth century,

00:18:04.868 --> 00:18:09.156
custom could very often become
a field of contest in which

00:18:09.156 --> 00:18:13.292
lords and tenants staked
competing claims about what the

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:15.548
customs were or should be.
 

00:18:15.548 --> 00:18:19.219
And this was very often to
happen in the later sixteenth

00:18:19.219 --> 00:18:22.756
and seventeenth centuries as
we'll see when we come to

00:18:22.756 --> 00:18:27.160
consider peasant rebellion and
popular protest in this period.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.539
Very often it revolves around
custom.

00:18:30.539 --> 00:18:34.009
Okay.
 

00:18:34.009 --> 00:18:40.325
Well, let's turn now to another
aspect of the tenant community,

00:18:40.325 --> 00:18:43.279
the community of neighbors.
 

00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:46.887
If custom was one key word in
rural society,

00:18:46.887 --> 00:18:51.420
"neighborliness"
was emphatically another.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:56.324
Neighborliness was recognized
as being a critically important

00:18:56.324 --> 00:19:00.002
social virtue,
and the word is constantly used

00:19:00.002 --> 00:19:03.108
as a kind of norm of good
conduct.

00:19:03.108 --> 00:19:07.778
It was of course based on
residence near one another.

00:19:07.778 --> 00:19:10.257
The very word
"neighbor"

00:19:10.257 --> 00:19:12.960
derives from an Anglo-Saxon
word,

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.689
"neah-gebur,"
which means "near

00:19:16.689 --> 00:19:19.508
dweller,"
literally "near

00:19:19.508 --> 00:19:21.000
dweller."
 

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.528
Neighborliness was based upon
residence,

00:19:23.528 --> 00:19:27.306
then, and it was conducted and
developed through frequent

00:19:27.306 --> 00:19:31.419
interaction amongst those who
lived near one another and their

00:19:31.419 --> 00:19:34.790
mutual recognition of
obligations to one another of

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.140
certain kinds.
 

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.561
In part it was created by the
institutions and the customs of

00:19:39.561 --> 00:19:43.212
the manor which fostered a sense
of place and a sense of identity

00:19:43.212 --> 00:19:45.608
associated with that particular
place.

00:19:45.608 --> 00:19:48.996
For example,
the manor court served as an

00:19:48.996 --> 00:19:53.990
instrument of self-regulation
especially in the organization

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:57.038
of agriculture within the manor.
 

00:19:57.038 --> 00:19:59.740
If you look at the other side
of the handout,

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:06.178
you'll see the portrayal by the
surveyor of Laxton of one of the

00:20:06.178 --> 00:20:10.182
fields,
and look at how those fields

00:20:10.182 --> 00:20:16.358
are--the field is divided up
into little strips of land,

00:20:16.358 --> 00:20:19.960
each of one is numbered--each
one of which is numbered.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:24.949
The tenants held their land
scattered in strips across the

00:20:24.949 --> 00:20:25.650
field.
 

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.903
The numbers are there so that
the surveyor could put down

00:20:28.903 --> 00:20:32.271
which pieces of land were held
by particular tenants in his

00:20:32.271 --> 00:20:35.147
survey book,
and there at the edge of the

00:20:35.147 --> 00:20:38.923
field is an area of common land
which was used by all the

00:20:38.923 --> 00:20:41.420
tenants for grazing their
animals.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:45.500
The surveyor has portrayed
various sheep grazing on it.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.556
It's a particularly beautiful
map, this map of Laxton,

00:20:48.556 --> 00:20:51.440
which was done in the early
seventeenth century.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.924
Well, that kind of arrangement,
that kind of scattering of land

00:20:54.924 --> 00:20:58.583
around the field,
that sharing of common grazing

00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:03.311
land inevitably meant that there
had to be a good deal of

00:21:03.311 --> 00:21:08.380
cooperative organization of
agriculture in such a place,

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:13.135
and the manor court provided
the opportunities to pass bylaws

00:21:13.135 --> 00:21:18.050
which enabled people to draw up
the rules for their cooperative

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.318
agriculture.
 

00:21:19.318 --> 00:21:23.614
Bylaws were described in one
contemporary law book as being

00:21:23.614 --> 00:21:27.613
made for the "common profit
and with the assent of

00:21:27.613 --> 00:21:28.650
all."
 

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:32.053
Ideally, you should have
unanimity about what they were

00:21:32.053 --> 00:21:35.708
and they governed not only
cooperative agriculture but also

00:21:35.708 --> 00:21:38.670
the mediation of disputes which
arose and,

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.721
if necessary,
the punishment of recalcitrant

00:21:41.721 --> 00:21:42.358
people.
 

00:21:42.358 --> 00:21:45.630
The aim, as one manor court
book describes it,

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.208
was that--I'm quoting
it--"all should concur in

00:21:49.208 --> 00:21:53.700
the keeping of good neighborhood
one with another in tilling,

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.509
in laboring,
in sowing, in shearing,

00:21:56.509 --> 00:22:01.138
in pasturing and all other
things pertaining to good and

00:22:01.138 --> 00:22:03.579
thrifty neighborhood."
 

00:22:03.579 --> 00:22:04.769
Okay.
 

00:22:04.769 --> 00:22:06.380
That was the ideal.
 

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:09.314
Of course, it wasn't simply a
happy world of peasant

00:22:09.314 --> 00:22:10.118
cooperation.
 

00:22:10.118 --> 00:22:13.542
In any manor the bigger
tenants, the ones who held the

00:22:13.542 --> 00:22:15.608
most land, tended to dominate.
 

00:22:15.608 --> 00:22:19.680
There were plenty of disputes
and arguments,

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:23.327
but the constant stress that
they placed on the value of

00:22:23.327 --> 00:22:26.354
neighborhood,
the constant appeals that were

00:22:26.354 --> 00:22:30.241
made to that ideal,
were certainly part and parcel

00:22:30.241 --> 00:22:34.180
of ensuring that these arguments
got resolved.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:38.868
One historian of this period
has described community as being

00:22:38.868 --> 00:22:43.010
in one sense belonging to the
same argument and to the

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:46.450
institutions which helped to
resolve it.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:50.198
There was a very strong
expectation that ultimately

00:22:50.198 --> 00:22:54.994
people would conform to a system
which was ruled by custom in the

00:22:54.994 --> 00:22:58.442
interests of ensuring the
sustainability of the

00:22:58.442 --> 00:23:03.016
agriculture of the community as
a whole and the subsistence of

00:23:03.016 --> 00:23:05.490
its component households.
 

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:09.763
Well, so much for the immediate
economic dimension of

00:23:09.763 --> 00:23:13.251
neighborhood,
but in addition neighborhood

00:23:13.251 --> 00:23:17.597
involved of course much more
than simply engaging in that

00:23:17.597 --> 00:23:21.688
kind of communal agriculture,
and in fact there were some

00:23:21.688 --> 00:23:25.253
areas of the country where that
kind of communal agriculture was

00:23:25.253 --> 00:23:26.670
much less significant.
 

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.798
Already in the sixteenth
century there were some counties

00:23:29.798 --> 00:23:33.153
in which land wasn't held in
great open fields like at Laxton

00:23:33.153 --> 00:23:36.673
but was already divided up into
the kinds of fields we associate

00:23:36.673 --> 00:23:38.910
with the English landscape
today,

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:42.880
enclosed with hedges and
ditches, each farmer owning a

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:47.075
certain number of fields or
holding as a tenant a certain

00:23:47.075 --> 00:23:51.046
number of fields and farming
them according to his own

00:23:51.046 --> 00:23:52.019
wishes.
 

00:23:52.019 --> 00:23:56.220
That kind of agriculture,
enclosed agriculture,

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.068
was already widely practiced in
Kent,

00:23:59.068 --> 00:24:02.201
in parts of the north of
England, and in some parts of

00:24:02.201 --> 00:24:05.451
eastern England in the counties
of Suffolk and Essex for

00:24:05.451 --> 00:24:07.460
example,
long established there,

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.750
and it was to become the norm
throughout the whole country,

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.778
as we will see.
 

00:24:12.778 --> 00:24:16.844
So the economic structure of
the manor and of neighborhood

00:24:16.844 --> 00:24:19.910
was of less significance in such
places,

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:24.277
but everywhere neighborliness
also found its expression in

00:24:24.277 --> 00:24:25.348
other forms.
 

00:24:25.348 --> 00:24:30.707
One form, a very important
form, was the ecclesiastical

00:24:30.707 --> 00:24:31.598
parish.
 

00:24:31.598 --> 00:24:35.130
England was divided up not only
into units of lordship,

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:39.671
the manor, but also into about
ten thousand ecclesiastical

00:24:39.671 --> 00:24:43.893
parishes which provided an
additional unit of identity

00:24:43.893 --> 00:24:48.115
expressed through people's
collective worship in their

00:24:48.115 --> 00:24:49.710
parish church.
 

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:56.730
Duties to one's neighbor were
of course a central element in

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:59.230
Christian teaching.
 

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:04.048
They implied a certain
universal moral obligation.

00:25:04.048 --> 00:25:06.695
Children were asked when they
were taught the church

00:25:06.695 --> 00:25:08.980
catechism, "who is my
neighbor?"

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:12.894
Everyone was your neighbor,
not only those who lived by

00:25:12.894 --> 00:25:15.960
you;
a universal moral obligation.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:20.250
And they were taught also that
the second part of the Ten

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.166
Commandments,
four to ten,

00:25:22.166 --> 00:25:25.078
involved duties to one's
neighbor;

00:25:25.078 --> 00:25:29.560
the second table were duties to
one's neighbor just as the first

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.618
table, the first few,
were duties to God.

00:25:32.618 --> 00:25:36.532
The church taught that one
should love one's neighbor as

00:25:36.532 --> 00:25:39.458
one's self,
which was of course exceedingly

00:25:39.458 --> 00:25:43.059
hard to do sometimes,
but the duty to try was

00:25:43.059 --> 00:25:45.420
reinforced in many ways.
 

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:50.390
At the ritual of the mass,
the kiss of peace was part of

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:55.361
the ritual which expressed
symbolically being in charity

00:25:55.361 --> 00:25:57.529
with your neighbors.
 

00:25:57.529 --> 00:26:02.016
Those who were known to be out
of charity with their neighbors

00:26:02.016 --> 00:26:05.914
could actually be excluded from
church services and in

00:26:05.914 --> 00:26:09.665
particular from the communion
service until they had

00:26:09.665 --> 00:26:14.429
reconciled themselves,
reentered charity with their

00:26:14.429 --> 00:26:19.220
neighbors and were then allowed
to take communion.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.913
The parish also stimulated
neighborly sentiments in other

00:26:21.913 --> 00:26:22.250
ways.
 

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:26.009
The fifteenth and the early
sixteenth centuries saw a

00:26:26.009 --> 00:26:29.913
remarkable flowering of what's
been described as parish

00:26:29.913 --> 00:26:33.554
communalism;
a whole world of activity

00:26:33.554 --> 00:26:35.940
centered on the church.
 

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.608
It involved the rebuilding and
beautification of many churches.

00:26:39.608 --> 00:26:42.410
Some of the most beautiful
parish churches surviving today

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:44.670
were actually reconstructed in
this period,

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:48.869
a period of relative prosperity
in which parishioners invested

00:26:48.869 --> 00:26:50.730
in their parish churches.
 

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:54.868
It was a period of the founding
of many parish religious guilds.

00:26:54.868 --> 00:26:58.467
These were associations of
parishioners sometimes drawn

00:26:58.467 --> 00:27:02.244
from the entire community,
sometimes particular sections:

00:27:02.244 --> 00:27:06.030
associations for the women,
associations for the young,

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:09.589
associations for those
associated with particular

00:27:09.589 --> 00:27:13.405
manors and so forth,
who maintained altars in the

00:27:13.405 --> 00:27:16.250
parish church,
maintained candles on those

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:19.541
altars,
had patron saints and owed

00:27:19.541 --> 00:27:21.960
duties to one another.
 

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.529
They prayed for one another.
 

00:27:23.529 --> 00:27:25.618
They looked after one another.
 

00:27:25.618 --> 00:27:29.522
It was also a period which saw
a flowering of elaborate ritual

00:27:29.522 --> 00:27:30.740
and festive life.
 

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:34.882
A great many of the traditional
seasonal festivals which are

00:27:34.882 --> 00:27:38.111
recorded in early
sixteenth-century England had

00:27:38.111 --> 00:27:42.253
actually emerged in the course
of this relatively prosperous

00:27:42.253 --> 00:27:44.150
late medieval period.
 

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.546
If this kind of aspect of
traditional popular culture

00:27:46.546 --> 00:27:49.214
interests you,
there's a wonderful book on the

00:27:49.214 --> 00:27:52.865
subject by Ronald Hutton called
The Rise and Fall of Merry

00:27:52.865 --> 00:27:56.453
England in which he goes in
to a great deal of detail on

00:27:56.453 --> 00:27:57.608
these matters.
 

00:27:57.608 --> 00:28:01.403
So whatever the framework,
whether we're talking about the

00:28:01.403 --> 00:28:05.328
manor or the parish or just
living close to one another,

00:28:05.328 --> 00:28:10.292
neighborhood found expression
and it found expression also of

00:28:10.292 --> 00:28:14.430
course in persistent
face-to-face daily contact.

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:18.630
The neighborhood was a primary
group.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.568
People knew each other
exceedingly well.

00:28:21.568 --> 00:28:24.965
They knew one another's
business exceedingly well as was

00:28:24.965 --> 00:28:28.672
often revealed when they were
called upon to give evidence in

00:28:28.672 --> 00:28:29.288
court.
 

00:28:29.288 --> 00:28:33.258
Households interpenetrated one
another in all kinds of ways:

00:28:33.258 --> 00:28:36.434
assisting one another,
borrowing from one another,

00:28:36.434 --> 00:28:39.642
lending to one another,
and a host of small-scale

00:28:39.642 --> 00:28:41.098
buying and selling.
 

00:28:41.098 --> 00:28:44.451
We get constant glimpses of
these interactions in the

00:28:44.451 --> 00:28:46.318
records that survive to us.
 

00:28:46.318 --> 00:28:50.160
One I recently saw for example
involved a woman who described

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:54.126
how on one day she went 'round
to her neighbor to borrow a bowl

00:28:54.126 --> 00:28:57.776
of flour because she'd run out
and couldn't get any at the

00:28:57.776 --> 00:28:58.480
mill.
 

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.988
On another day she went 'round
to see her neighbor to get some

00:29:01.988 --> 00:29:05.324
burning coals from her fire so
that she could start her own

00:29:05.324 --> 00:29:08.630
fire more easily,
this kind of constant little

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:11.180
small change of daily
interaction.

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:14.653
We know about these things
because she happened to notice

00:29:14.653 --> 00:29:18.501
on her visits that her neighbor
was a little over-friendly with

00:29:18.501 --> 00:29:22.101
her lodger which resulted in an
adultery case in the church

00:29:22.101 --> 00:29:24.083
courts,
and these little details of

00:29:24.083 --> 00:29:27.846
their relationship,
both positive and negative,

00:29:27.846 --> 00:29:29.348
are revealed.
 

00:29:29.348 --> 00:29:32.640
We find neighbors involved in
arbitrating quarrels,

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.272
in child minding,
in visiting one another when

00:29:36.272 --> 00:29:38.797
sick,
in giving one another advice,

00:29:38.797 --> 00:29:43.519
in gossiping with one another,
in reproving one another.

00:29:43.519 --> 00:29:48.200
It's all well documented,
involved in one another's

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:53.910
business to an extent which
would be very unfamiliar today.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:30:00.118
It all adds up to a tangled web
of interpersonal obligation.

00:30:00.118 --> 00:30:03.420
Christopher Dyer,
who has written a wonderful

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:06.420
book about part of the west
Midlands,

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.950
over here on the border with
Wales,

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:14.696
did one study of the wills of
fifteen families in a village in

00:30:14.696 --> 00:30:18.088
that region between 1513 and
1540.

00:30:18.088 --> 00:30:22.384
He found that of the fifteen
families some of them were

00:30:22.384 --> 00:30:27.075
linked to as many as seven of
the others by ties of debt and

00:30:27.075 --> 00:30:29.415
credit,
of god parenthood,

00:30:29.415 --> 00:30:32.190
of witnessing one another's
wills,

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:36.259
of leaving things to one
another in their wills,

00:30:36.259 --> 00:30:38.666
all adding up,
as he describes it,

00:30:38.666 --> 00:30:41.440
to "a close web of
friendship,

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.601
of mutual regard,
and of shared

00:30:43.601 --> 00:30:46.709
responsibility"--
and those are just the

00:30:46.709 --> 00:30:50.471
relationships which happen to
have left recorded evidence for

00:30:50.471 --> 00:30:51.788
historians to see.
 

00:30:51.788 --> 00:30:58.698
Well, drawing on these ties
could be crucial at times of

00:30:58.698 --> 00:31:00.960
particular need.
 

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.000
This is a period which lacks,
as I've said before,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.538
any form of life insurance or
other forms of insurance.

00:31:07.538 --> 00:31:12.259
Neighbors could provide a kind
of social insurance.

00:31:12.259 --> 00:31:14.338
You find them backing one
another up.

00:31:14.338 --> 00:31:16.461
For example,
when a couple were to be

00:31:16.461 --> 00:31:20.056
married it was common for the
neighborhood to gather to hold a

00:31:20.056 --> 00:31:21.000
'bride-ale'.
 

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.760
Ale would be brewed,
people would come along,

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.527
they would pay for the ale and
the proceeds would be given to

00:31:27.527 --> 00:31:28.720
the new couple.
 

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.540
You also get 'help-ales' when
someone was in need in another

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:32.930
way.
 

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:36.878
One from the late sixteenth
century for example describes

00:31:36.878 --> 00:31:41.181
how a help-ale was organized for
a widow whose cow had died to

00:31:41.181 --> 00:31:47.196
provide her with a new animal,
which was important to her

00:31:47.196 --> 00:31:49.380
family economy.
 

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.680
Because these ties could be so
supportive,

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.219
at best, there was a strong
imperative amongst people to

00:31:56.219 --> 00:32:00.078
maintain what they described as
their "credit",

00:32:00.078 --> 00:32:02.618
to maintain their credit in the
neighborhood,

00:32:02.618 --> 00:32:06.750
by which they meant their
reputation in general,

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:10.289
their reputation for
reliability, for honesty,

00:32:10.289 --> 00:32:12.028
for good conduct.
 

00:32:12.028 --> 00:32:15.413
It involved much more than
simply a sort of credit rating

00:32:15.413 --> 00:32:18.798
in a financial sense as we are
familiar with it today.

00:32:18.798 --> 00:32:21.526
It was a form,
as I've said,

00:32:21.526 --> 00:32:25.970
of social insurance in an
insecure world,

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:30.165
and the price of good credit,
the price of that element of

00:32:30.165 --> 00:32:33.376
security,
was conformity,

00:32:33.376 --> 00:32:40.980
conformity to the standards of
the neighborhood.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:46.022
So ties of neighborhood were
something which one could also

00:32:46.022 --> 00:32:50.720
extend from the countryside in
to urban communities.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.984
In the town of Folkestone,
which is down here on the south

00:32:53.984 --> 00:32:55.578
coast in Kent,
for example,

00:32:55.578 --> 00:32:58.626
one young woman who had been
recently married and was coming

00:32:58.626 --> 00:33:01.932
to the town with her husband for
the first time found that in the

00:33:01.932 --> 00:33:04.722
street where they were going to
live the neighbors were

00:33:04.722 --> 00:33:05.548
gathered.
 

00:33:05.548 --> 00:33:07.993
When she arrived they called
out, "where is she that

00:33:07.993 --> 00:33:09.259
will be our neighbor?"
 

00:33:09.259 --> 00:33:10.788
and drank to her.
 

00:33:10.788 --> 00:33:14.000
They had a barrel of beer ready
to welcome her.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.911
It matters in towns too,
often at the level of the

00:33:17.911 --> 00:33:18.630
street.
 

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:22.528
The towns also had distinctive
institutions which you wouldn't

00:33:22.528 --> 00:33:24.190
find in the countryside.
 

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:30.568
Most towns had a very strong
sense of identity as autonomous,

00:33:30.568 --> 00:33:34.106
self-governing communities,
especially those of them which

00:33:34.106 --> 00:33:37.644
actually had a charter from the
king which laid down their

00:33:37.644 --> 00:33:41.425
rights of self-government,
those which were chartered

00:33:41.425 --> 00:33:42.140
boroughs.
 

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:46.432
The core members of these
communities were the citizens

00:33:46.432 --> 00:33:51.442
who held the freedom of the city
and as freemen of the city were

00:33:51.442 --> 00:33:55.180
enabled to participate in civic
government.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.098
So in the city of York for
example,

00:33:57.098 --> 00:34:00.248
up here in the north,
about half the male household

00:34:00.248 --> 00:34:03.961
heads of the city had the status
of freemen and were able to

00:34:03.961 --> 00:34:07.298
participate in the city's
political institutions.

00:34:07.298 --> 00:34:10.467
In the city of Norwich,
over here in the east,

00:34:10.467 --> 00:34:14.059
it was about a third of the
male household heads.

00:34:14.059 --> 00:34:18.159
Citizenship was usually
contingent on having served an

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:21.099
apprenticeship in a craft or
trade,

00:34:21.099 --> 00:34:26.568
having served it to its end,
become a member of a craft

00:34:26.568 --> 00:34:31.936
fellowship or guild and
consequently being admitted to

00:34:31.936 --> 00:34:35.280
the full freedom of the city.
 

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.088
And the great men in the
political life of the cities

00:34:38.088 --> 00:34:41.331
were usually the chief officers
of those craft fellowships or

00:34:41.331 --> 00:34:45.182
guilds,
especially the most powerful

00:34:45.182 --> 00:34:45.869
ones.
 

00:34:45.869 --> 00:34:50.000
Guilds varied in number.
 

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.809
The city of York had sixty-four.
 

00:34:52.809 --> 00:34:55.742
The much smaller city of
Carlisle over here in the

00:34:55.742 --> 00:34:57.360
northwest only had eight.
 

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:01.378
It all depended on the size and
complexity of the urban economy,

00:35:01.378 --> 00:35:04.440
but their functions were
essentially the same.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:07.610
They regulated particular
trades.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.813
They governed the taking on of
apprentices, how many

00:35:10.813 --> 00:35:13.639
apprentices could be admitted to
the trade.

00:35:13.639 --> 00:35:17.311
They tried to keep nonmembers
of the guild out of practicing

00:35:17.311 --> 00:35:18.059
the trade.
 

00:35:18.059 --> 00:35:20.976
Such people were usually
described as foreigners,

00:35:20.976 --> 00:35:24.682
those who were not members of
the guild and were trying to get

00:35:24.682 --> 00:35:26.750
in on its particular activity.
 

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.500
They controlled the business
practices of masters.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.809
They laid down the rules for
good business practice and they

00:35:32.809 --> 00:35:35.110
controlled labor relations and
labors--

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:39.940
and wages--between masters and
those who worked for them.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:44.648
But in addition the guilds had
a host of social and religious

00:35:44.648 --> 00:35:45.590
functions.
 

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:49.570
Members of the guild were under
obligation to relieve other

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:52.110
members of the guild who fell
sick.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:55.469
They provided them with medical
care.

00:35:55.469 --> 00:35:58.940
They were under obligation to
relieve members of the guild who

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:00.079
became unemployed.
 

00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:04.603
They provided for widows and
orphans from charitable funds

00:36:04.603 --> 00:36:06.429
that they maintained.
 

00:36:06.429 --> 00:36:10.514
It was obligatory for members
of the guild to attend one

00:36:10.514 --> 00:36:13.039
another's funerals and weddings.
 

00:36:13.039 --> 00:36:17.452
They were obliged also to pray
for the souls of dead brothers

00:36:17.452 --> 00:36:21.500
and sisters of the guild and
they were obliged to attend

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.516
annual feastings and
"drinkings"

00:36:24.516 --> 00:36:28.635
at which members of the guild
would assemble to celebrate

00:36:28.635 --> 00:36:30.989
their common fraternity.
 

00:36:30.989 --> 00:36:35.166
All of this fostered a very
strong sense of fraternity or

00:36:35.166 --> 00:36:36.210
brotherhood.
 

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:39.445
They constantly referred to one
another as brothers and sisters

00:36:39.445 --> 00:36:42.472
of the guild,
the sisters being the wives and

00:36:42.472 --> 00:36:45.018
daughters of members of the
guild,

00:36:45.018 --> 00:36:48.572
and it created a strong sense
of identity both within a

00:36:48.572 --> 00:36:52.123
particular sector of urban
economies and in the citizen

00:36:52.123 --> 00:36:53.440
body as a whole.
 

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.547
And in the citizen body as a
whole it would be periodically

00:36:56.547 --> 00:36:59.548
displayed in processions on
important feast days in which

00:36:59.548 --> 00:37:02.550
the members of the guild arrayed
in their liveries--

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:05.690
the colors of their guild,
gowns in particular colors--

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:09.869
would parade in order;
generally in order with their,

00:37:09.869 --> 00:37:13.119
of their, precedence and
importance within the city.

00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:16.827
When Queen Elizabeth I made her
first entry into the city of

00:37:16.827 --> 00:37:18.963
London in 1559,
for example,

00:37:18.963 --> 00:37:23.393
the streets were lined by the
city guilds all in their

00:37:23.393 --> 00:37:26.320
liveries to greet the new queen.
 

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:31.532
Finally, the fraternity and the
brotherhood which was much

00:37:31.532 --> 00:37:36.925
stressed by the guilds and the
friendship which was fostered

00:37:36.925 --> 00:37:41.465
amongst neighbors,
ideally, could both be

00:37:41.465 --> 00:37:47.775
described as being extensions
into social relations of the

00:37:47.775 --> 00:37:49.989
idiom of kinship.
 

00:37:49.989 --> 00:37:52.836
"Friend"
was often used in the sense we

00:37:52.836 --> 00:37:56.039
use it, a personal friend,
but it also in the sixteenth

00:37:56.039 --> 00:37:57.760
century meant a relative.
 

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:01.059
It's still used in that sense
in parts of Ireland today.

00:38:01.059 --> 00:38:07.219
A friend was commonly a cousin,
a brother-in-law and so forth.

00:38:07.219 --> 00:38:12.083
Brotherhood and fraternity
obviously involve comparison to

00:38:12.083 --> 00:38:13.789
a bond of kinship.
 

00:38:13.789 --> 00:38:18.110
When one turns to actual
kinship, be it by birth or be it

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:21.969
by marriage, that was,
of course, another bond that

00:38:21.969 --> 00:38:24.440
held together local society.
 

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:28.806
The gentry of the countryside
were much linked together within

00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:31.599
particular counties by
intermarriage.

00:38:31.599 --> 00:38:35.780
A close social network can
often be uncovered amongst

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:40.443
gentry families who not only
lived within easy reach of one

00:38:40.443 --> 00:38:43.579
another but also sometimes
formed,

00:38:43.579 --> 00:38:46.514
through their marriage
alliances, political alignments

00:38:46.514 --> 00:38:48.730
within the politics of their
counties.

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:51.697
And we get the same sort of
thing going on in the cities too

00:38:51.697 --> 00:38:53.960
especially amongst the elite of
the cities.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:57.681
In the city of Coventry,
which is the greatest city of

00:38:57.681 --> 00:39:01.885
the Midlands at this time,
in Coventry there were

00:39:01.885 --> 00:39:07.887
twenty-four men who served as
sheriff of the city between 1517

00:39:07.887 --> 00:39:09.070
and 1547.
 

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:12.115
On closer examination,
it turns out that six of them

00:39:12.115 --> 00:39:15.925
were either fathers,
sons or brothers of others who

00:39:15.925 --> 00:39:19.382
served as sheriff,
nine of them were interlinked

00:39:19.382 --> 00:39:22.039
by marriage into one another's
families,

00:39:22.039 --> 00:39:25.449
and another four were
interlinked by ties of

00:39:25.449 --> 00:39:26.719
godparenthood.
 

00:39:26.719 --> 00:39:31.003
They'd acted as godparents of
one another's children,

00:39:31.003 --> 00:39:34.380
establishing a bond of fictive
kinship.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.918
And more generally,
as you know from the reading

00:39:37.918 --> 00:39:41.221
for this week,
the extent to which people in

00:39:41.221 --> 00:39:45.123
any given settlement were
actually related to one another

00:39:45.123 --> 00:39:46.170
was limited.
 

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:50.789
People moved around a good deal
more than used to be thought.

00:39:50.789 --> 00:39:54.900
In most rural communities one
finds little knots of people

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:58.938
related to one another but
within the context of a larger

00:39:58.938 --> 00:40:01.679
neighborhood of unrelated
people,

00:40:01.679 --> 00:40:06.592
and beyond that there would be
a scattering of kin over a

00:40:06.592 --> 00:40:09.050
significantly larger area.
 

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:11.543
Nevertheless,
if it wasn't the case that most

00:40:11.543 --> 00:40:14.320
village communities were heavily
interrelated,

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:18.005
those close kin scattered
around over what can be

00:40:18.005 --> 00:40:22.306
described as a social area
around a particular settlement

00:40:22.306 --> 00:40:26.760
undoubtedly possessed quite a
strong sense of obligation to

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.679
assist one another.
 

00:40:28.679 --> 00:40:33.181
And across even larger areas
one's kin could form a broad

00:40:33.181 --> 00:40:37.364
resource of people who could be
called upon with some

00:40:37.364 --> 00:40:40.500
expectation of a positive
response.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.800
If you hoped to apprentice one
of your sons to a nearby city

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.275
for example,
one of the best ways of doing

00:40:46.275 --> 00:40:49.773
that was to activate kin living
there who could help to prepare

00:40:49.773 --> 00:40:52.650
the way by finding a master to
whom the boy could be

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:53.610
apprenticed.
 

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:57.487
Kin also helped one another in
finding suitable marriage

00:40:57.487 --> 00:40:59.179
partners and so forth.
 

00:40:59.179 --> 00:41:06.940
So kinship was also one of the
bonds which tied together social

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:10.070
areas into communities.
 

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:13.094
To give just a small,
petty example of the way in

00:41:13.094 --> 00:41:17.021
which kinship could function,
we have the record from the

00:41:17.021 --> 00:41:20.280
1550s of an old lady called
Christian Hatton.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:24.588
In her old age when she was
unable to take care of herself

00:41:24.588 --> 00:41:27.413
fully,
she was cared for in turn by

00:41:27.413 --> 00:41:31.853
kinsmen who lived in a number of
settlements within walking

00:41:31.853 --> 00:41:33.920
distance of one another.
 

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.378
They shared the responsibility
and periodically she walked

00:41:37.378 --> 00:41:41.201
between the different households
where she was going to live for

00:41:41.201 --> 00:41:45.769
a few months at a time,
taking with her her two cows.

00:41:45.769 --> 00:41:47.619
She had two cows.
 

00:41:47.619 --> 00:41:52.639
They were called Browny and
Fillpale.

00:41:52.639 --> 00:41:56.949
Fillpale was presumably a very
good milker.

00:41:56.949 --> 00:42:00.155
We know about these
arrangements about Christian

00:42:00.155 --> 00:42:04.250
Hatton and her two cows because
after her death the relatives

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:08.208
who had been helping her fell
out over who was going to get

00:42:08.208 --> 00:42:12.264
the cows,
and so by this little accident

00:42:12.264 --> 00:42:17.996
of human frailty Browny and
Fillpale have entered the pages

00:42:17.996 --> 00:42:19.380
of history.
 

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:21.690
&gt;
 

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:25.550
So let's put all this together.
 

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:28.023
It's been said that in late
medieval and early modern

00:42:28.023 --> 00:42:30.449
society "the most
fundamental of all bond...

00:42:30.449 --> 00:42:33.619
was that of mutual
obligation."

00:42:33.619 --> 00:42:36.309
That's what I've been talking
about obviously.

00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:39.980
We have been looking at the
realities of those bonds.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.934
The institutions and the
relationships that I've been

00:42:43.934 --> 00:42:47.811
surveying provided the basic
coordinates of people's

00:42:47.811 --> 00:42:50.550
identities beyond the household.
 

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:55.585
They bound them together into
networks of relationships in

00:42:55.585 --> 00:42:58.759
guilds,
in manors, amongst neighbors,

00:42:58.759 --> 00:43:03.103
amongst kinsmen,
which provided those

00:43:03.103 --> 00:43:06.760
coordinates of identity.
 

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:11.746
Those ties were mostly local
and they gave a strong flavor of

00:43:11.746 --> 00:43:16.400
local particularity to the
society and the culture of the

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.048
time;
a particularity of place,

00:43:19.048 --> 00:43:22.239
a particularity of custom in
that place,

00:43:22.239 --> 00:43:26.190
a particularity of known faces
and those with whom you

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:30.902
regularly interacted,
a particularity of assumptions

00:43:30.902 --> 00:43:34.900
about shared values and proper
behavior.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:39.114
In such a context people's
everyday dealings were very

00:43:39.114 --> 00:43:43.568
closely bound up with these
direct, face-to-face personal

00:43:43.568 --> 00:43:45.000
relationships.
 

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.409
They were rarely anonymous.
 

00:43:47.409 --> 00:43:52.268
Indeed, they can be said to
have taken on a very strong

00:43:52.268 --> 00:43:56.860
moral character implicitly,
sometimes explicitly.

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:59.090
People were expected to meet
their obligations.

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:03.079
They were enjoined to live in
charity with one another.

00:44:03.079 --> 00:44:06.090
They were reproved if they
failed to do so.

00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:09.766
In many ways it's a very
attractive ideal and has some

00:44:09.766 --> 00:44:13.097
features,
which clearly bear out some of

00:44:13.097 --> 00:44:16.847
the assumptions of the
sociological notions of

00:44:16.847 --> 00:44:17.929
community.
 

00:44:17.929 --> 00:44:21.840
But one should also never
forget that it could also be

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:25.389
very demanding,
very restrictive,

00:44:25.389 --> 00:44:30.349
very excluding as well as
including,

00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:33.233
and it was something which
certainly couldn't be taken for

00:44:33.233 --> 00:44:33.739
granted.
 

00:44:33.739 --> 00:44:37.934
Community insofar as it existed
was always threatened with

00:44:37.934 --> 00:44:39.480
potential conflict.
 

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.800
It had to be worked at.
 

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:47.679
It has been described as being
a form of constantly negotiated

00:44:47.679 --> 00:44:52.210
community amongst a set of
well-known people.

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:55.217
Well, that's a very important
aspect of the world I'm trying

00:44:55.217 --> 00:44:56.340
to introduce to you.
 

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:59.670
We should certainly never
sentimentalize it.

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:03.344
If it was attractive in some
ways, it could be very

00:45:03.344 --> 00:45:05.550
demanding, very restrictive.
 

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:08.969
It wasn't an idyllic pre-modern
world.

00:45:08.969 --> 00:45:10.260
There was plenty of conflict.
 

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:14.293
There was personal rivalry and
of course there were differences

00:45:14.293 --> 00:45:15.010
of power.
 

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:18.769
But at the same time it was a
world that gave priority to the

00:45:18.769 --> 00:45:22.657
needs of these collectivities as
well as to those of individual

00:45:22.657 --> 00:45:25.570
households,
and the restraining bonds of

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:29.460
these interpersonal obligations
could have a very powerful

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:33.079
influence on how people
conducted themselves and could

00:45:33.079 --> 00:45:36.900
have a very powerful influence
on how they understood and

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:40.586
perceived and responded to
various of the changes which

00:45:40.586 --> 00:45:44.545
were to come in the course of
the sixteenth and seventeenth

00:45:44.545 --> 00:45:45.980
centuries.
 

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:47.170
Okay.
 

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:50.213
I'll leave it there,
and next time I'll go on to

00:45:50.213 --> 00:45:54.230
look at urban society more fully
and the network of connections

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:57.340
which bound together the kingdom
as a whole.

00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:03.000

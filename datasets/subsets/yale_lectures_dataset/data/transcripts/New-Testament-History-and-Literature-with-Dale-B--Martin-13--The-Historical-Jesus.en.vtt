00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.444
Prof: Okay,
we've already talked about the

00:00:03.444 --> 00:00:05.840
problems of using these texts
historically.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.206
If you remember,
early in the semester we talked

00:00:09.206 --> 00:00:12.887
about Galatians 1 and 2,
and Acts, and we tried to

00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:17.500
compare exactly when did Paul go
where with regard to Jerusalem,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.020
Damascus, Antioch.
 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.808
And we saw that it's very,
very difficult to harmonize

00:00:22.808 --> 00:00:26.454
Galatians 1 and 2 with the
account of Acts in Paul's

00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:28.670
movements around Jerusalem.
 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.194
We've also got a lot of other
situations where this would be

00:00:32.194 --> 00:00:33.210
very difficult.
 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.310
I mentioned the differences
between Matthew and Luke as far

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.700
as the birth narratives.
 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.580
Just to try to figure out how
this would work,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.374
if you took the birth
narratives of Matthew and Luke

00:00:44.374 --> 00:00:47.126
it would be very,
very difficult to find out

00:00:47.126 --> 00:00:48.910
historically what happened.
 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.643
For example,
if you just take Matthew,

00:00:51.643 --> 00:00:55.262
as I've said before,
Jesus' family seems to simply

00:00:55.262 --> 00:00:56.740
be in Bethlehem.
 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.370
It doesn't say they're from
Galilee,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.980
it doesn't say they're
originally from Nazareth,

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.938
they're just in Bethlehem,
and they're in Bethlehem well

00:01:02.938 --> 00:01:06.165
before Jesus is born because the
wise men in the East see the

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:09.500
star and it takes them enough
time to travel from Persia,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.438
we're supposed to understand
from the narrative because

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:14.807
they're called Magi,
and those are wise men from

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:17.110
Persia,
all the way to Jerusalem.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.438
They meet up with King Herod
the Great,

00:01:19.438 --> 00:01:22.388
he gets his wise men to
consult, they then find out

00:01:22.388 --> 00:01:24.688
they're supposed to go to
Bethlehem,

00:01:24.688 --> 00:01:27.677
they journey to Bethlehem,
and then they get there not

00:01:27.677 --> 00:01:29.200
long after Jesus is born.
 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.194
So according to Matthew,
you don't have any time

00:01:32.194 --> 00:01:35.765
actually in the narrative of
Matthew for the whole moving

00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:39.271
from Nazareth to Bethlehem
narrative that you get in the

00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:40.610
Gospel of Luke.
 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.430
You just don't have time in
Matthew, they're just there.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.870
And then the angel appears to
Joseph in a dream and says,

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.730
Herod's going to kill all the
babies,

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.550
so Joseph takes the family,
they move to Egypt for a while.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.640
He gets another dream years
later, how many years,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.810
who knows, saying that Herod
the Great is now dead,

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.245
so they go back--they start to
go back to Bethlehem because it

00:02:04.245 --> 00:02:06.049
says that's their home,
right?

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.488
They go back home,
they're going to go to

00:02:07.488 --> 00:02:07.920
Bethlehem.
 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.471
Instead they move to Galilee to
avoid Herod's son,

00:02:11.471 --> 00:02:14.370
who is at the time,
according to Matthew,

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.819
ruling in Judea.
 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.310
That's the sort of narrative.
 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.889
You get to Luke and it's very
different.

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.964
They're from Nazareth,
that's sort of Mary's hometown,

00:02:24.964 --> 00:02:25.810
Nazareth.
 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.688
All the pregnancy of Mary takes
place with Mary in Nazareth.

00:02:29.688 --> 00:02:33.250
She even goes to Judea to visit
her kinswoman Elizabeth,

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.789
who is the mother of John the
Baptist according to the Gospel

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:38.419
of Luke,
and then she goes back to

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:40.167
Nazareth,
and then it's according to this

00:02:40.167 --> 00:02:42.157
census,
the world census that they go

00:02:42.157 --> 00:02:44.390
to Bethlehem,
and it's while they're in

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.236
Bethlehem in the stable,
because you don't have a stable

00:02:47.236 --> 00:02:49.985
in Matthew,
they're just maybe in a home or

00:02:49.985 --> 00:02:53.128
according to a lot of traditions
Jesus was--

00:02:53.128 --> 00:02:56.460
there was a cave somewhere that
Jesus was born in.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.109
It's in Luke that you get the
whole story about--the Christmas

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.670
story about the stable that
Jesus is born in because there's

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.669
no room in the inn.
 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:05.460
They stay in that area for a
month,

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.889
we know that because it says
that they first have Jesus

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.050
circumcised on the eighth day
from his birth,

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.550
and then the time of
purification takes place,

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.628
according to Leviticus,
which is about a month long,

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:16.127
they take Jesus to the
presentation of the temple in

00:03:16.127 --> 00:03:16.479
Jerusalem.
 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.316
And it's after that,
so a month or so after his

00:03:19.316 --> 00:03:22.400
birth that they then move back
home to Nazareth.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.228
Now there's no way you can
basically get these two

00:03:26.228 --> 00:03:31.150
narratives to fit together in
any respectable historical way.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.160
Does that mean that nobody's
ever tried to do it?

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.020
No, of course you've got all
kinds of very,

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.337
very smart fundamentalists who
believe that the New Testament

00:03:38.337 --> 00:03:41.599
has to be accurate in every
historical and scientific detail

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.199
or they believe then it can't be
scripture.

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:47.229
They will figure out some way
to try to make sure that both

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:49.318
these narratives can be fit
together,

00:03:49.318 --> 00:03:52.182
but what I'm telling you is
that no reputable historian will

00:03:52.182 --> 00:03:54.853
accept this because you just
have to fudge the stuff too

00:03:54.853 --> 00:03:56.639
much;
you have to fudge the data.

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.910
What do we believe about the
birth of Jesus?

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.171
Most of us think we don't know
anything about the birth of

00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:02.628
Jesus.
 

00:04:02.628 --> 00:04:05.080
All the Christmas stories are
later tradition,

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.479
probably the one thing most of
us would say is that Jesus

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:11.598
probably was from Nazareth,
his family was simply from

00:04:11.598 --> 00:04:14.000
Nazareth because he's called
Jesus of Nazareth.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.560
And the traditions that got him
to Bethlehem for his birth are

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.829
probably later pietistic
traditions that Matthew and Luke

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.339
later developed for different
reasons,

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:26.958
but to get Jesus born in
Bethlehem for fulfillment of

00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.278
prophecy reasons.
 

00:04:28.278 --> 00:04:32.990
If you take the birth of Jesus
in Luke and Matthew,

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.401
it's--from a historical point
of view it's impossible really

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:39.985
to harmonize them without coming
up with fantastic unbelievable

00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:43.398
conjugations of Jesus moving
back and forth to Egypt and the

00:04:43.398 --> 00:04:46.000
holy family and all this sort of
thing.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.629
We get lots of other kinds of
things about this too.

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:53.930
What are some obvious
historical problems with the

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.209
historical Jesus?
 

00:04:55.209 --> 00:04:58.990
Well one of the things is the
trial of Jesus.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.451
There are different versions of
the trial of Jesus in the

00:05:02.451 --> 00:05:03.069
Gospels.
 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:06.692
Unfortunately,
basically most scholars will

00:05:06.692 --> 00:05:11.697
say that we don't really know
what happened at the trial of

00:05:11.697 --> 00:05:12.560
Jesus.
 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.113
We don't even know for sure
whether there was any kind of

00:05:15.113 --> 00:05:15.889
official trial.
 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.781
It may have been that he was
just arrested in the middle of

00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:20.843
the night,
he was just then--they give him

00:05:20.843 --> 00:05:23.670
permission to be crucified and
he was crucified the next day.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.360
That would be the sensible way
of doing things.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.735
You didn't have to have--the
Romans didn't need elaborate

00:05:29.735 --> 00:05:33.413
trials in order to crucify Jews
who were rabble rousers in the

00:05:33.413 --> 00:05:35.959
first century,
they did it all the time.

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:38.677
If you look at some of the
details of the trial notice how

00:05:38.677 --> 00:05:39.870
they're very different.
 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.009
Mark 14, get your Bibles out.
 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.800
Today we are talking about the
historical Jesus but I'm not

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.788
just going to tell you what I
believe or what scholars believe

00:05:50.788 --> 00:05:54.399
about the historical Jesus,
I'm going to try to show you

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:56.949
why scholars come up with ideas
that we have,

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:59.976
how we get there,
what is our method for arriving

00:05:59.976 --> 00:06:02.120
at historical Jesus discussions.
 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.379
Look at Mark 14:53:
 

00:06:17.028 --> 00:06:19.093
They took Jesus to the high
priest and all the chief

00:06:19.093 --> 00:06:21.278
priests, the elders,
and the scribes were assembled.

00:06:21.278 --> 00:06:23.468
Peter had followed him at a
distance right into the

00:06:23.468 --> 00:06:25.922
courtyard of the high priest,
and he was sitting with the

00:06:25.922 --> 00:06:27.629
guards warming himself at the
fire.

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:30.026
Now the chief priests and the
whole council were looking for

00:06:30.026 --> 00:06:32.343
testimony against Jesus to put
him to death but they found

00:06:32.343 --> 00:06:32.709
none.
 

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:35.478
Many gave false testimony
against him and their testimony

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:36.269
did not agree.
 

00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:38.870
Some stood up and gave false
testimony against him saying,

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.949
"We have heard him say,
'I will destroy this temple

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:43.410
that is made with hands and in
three days I will build another

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.629
not made with hands.'"
But even on this point their

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:46.800
testimony did not agree.
 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.228
Then the high priest stood up
before them and asked Jesus,

00:06:49.228 --> 00:06:50.379
"Have you no answer?
 

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:52.470
What is it that they testify
against you?"

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.139
But he was silent and did not
answer.

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:57.377
Again the high priest asked
him, "Are you the Messiah,

00:06:57.377 --> 00:06:58.730
the Son of the Blessed
One?"

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.250
Jesus said, "I am.
 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.904
And you will see the Son of Man
seated at the right hand of

00:07:02.904 --> 00:07:05.240
power and coming with the clouds
of heaven."

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.269
[That's a quotation from
Daniel, so Jesus basically just

00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:09.911
says,
"I am,"

00:07:09.911 --> 00:07:13.730
and then quotes Daniel.]
The high priest accused him of

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:14.649
blasphemy.
 

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:17.815
Then look at chapter 15,
beginning of chapter 15,

00:07:17.815 --> 00:07:19.415
"
As soon as it was morning,

00:07:19.415 --> 00:07:21.583
the chief priests held a
consultation with the elders and

00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:22.860
scribes and the whole council.
 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.480
They bound Jesus,
led him away,

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.209
and handed him over to Pilate.
 

00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:27.745
Pilate asked him,
"Are you the King of the

00:07:27.745 --> 00:07:28.180
Jews?"
 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.910
He answered him,
"You say so."

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.040
Then the chief priest accused
him of many things.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.940
Pilate asked him again,
"Have you no answer?

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.879
See how many charges they bring
against you."

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:40.389
But Jesus made no further reply
so that Pilate was amazed.

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:43.930
Now notice all Jesus says at
his trial,

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.997
according to Mark,
the oldest of our written

00:07:45.997 --> 00:07:47.889
testimonies,
is "I am"

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:50.600
and a quotation of scripture at
one point,

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.827
and then, "so you
say," in the next trial

00:07:53.827 --> 00:07:54.860
before Pilate.
 

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.379
Now compare that to what goes
on in the Gospel of John.

00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:01.668
I mentioned this a bit in my
lecture on the Gospel of John,

00:08:01.668 --> 00:08:05.129
how its narrative details are
very different from the synoptic

00:08:05.129 --> 00:08:05.810
Gospels.
 

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.480
One of the places where this is
really different is the trial of

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:08.819
Jesus.
 

00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:12.867
John 18:19, I'm not going to
read all of this because it's

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:15.514
just way too long,
there's a part of--the

00:08:15.514 --> 00:08:18.504
interesting thing is that the
trial of Jesus goes on for a

00:08:18.504 --> 00:08:20.339
long time in the Gospel of John.
 

00:08:20.339 --> 00:08:22.851
The high priest questioned
Jesus about his disciples and

00:08:22.851 --> 00:08:23.810
about his teaching.
 

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.088
Jesus answered,
"I have spoken openly to

00:08:26.088 --> 00:08:26.709
the world.
 

00:08:26.709 --> 00:08:28.932
I have always taught synagogues
near the temple where all the

00:08:28.932 --> 00:08:29.709
Jews come together.
 

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:30.870
I have said nothing in secret.
 

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:31.759
Why do you ask me?"
 

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:35.393
Already Jesus has said a ton
more now than he has said in the

00:08:35.393 --> 00:08:37.149
other Gospels at his trial.
 

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:41.158
Then he just keeps going on,
he says more things:

00:08:41.158 --> 00:08:43.096
When he had said this,
one of the police standing

00:08:43.096 --> 00:08:44.788
nearby struck Jesus in the face
saying,

00:08:44.788 --> 00:08:46.230
"Is that how you answer
the high priest?"

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.143
Jesus answered,
"If I have spoken wrongly,

00:08:48.143 --> 00:08:49.100
testify to the wrong.
 

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.740
But if I have spoken rightly,
why do you strike me?"

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.168
Then Annas sent him down to
Caiaphas the high priest.

00:08:54.168 --> 00:08:56.964
So according to John,
Annas and Caiaphas are kinfolk,

00:08:56.964 --> 00:08:59.758
and they're sort of both
members of the high priestly

00:08:59.758 --> 00:09:00.350
family.
 

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:01.750
You can go on and on.
 

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:09.408
At verse 28 is the trial--they
took Jesus to Pilate.

00:09:09.408 --> 00:09:12.383
Pilate went out to them and
said, "What accusation do

00:09:12.383 --> 00:09:14.210
you bring against this
man?"

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:15.370
They answered,
"If this man were not a

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.000
criminal, we would not have
handed him over to you."

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.380
Pilate said to them,
"Take him yourselves and

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.509
judge him according to your
law."

00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:20.451
The Jews answered,
"We are not

00:09:20.451 --> 00:09:20.950
permitted."
 

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.230
It goes on, Pilate talks to
Jesus,

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.418
"Are you the King of the
Jews?"

00:09:25.418 --> 00:09:27.081
Jesus answered,
"Do you ask this on your

00:09:27.081 --> 00:09:28.778
own, or did others tell you
about it?"

00:09:28.778 --> 00:09:30.710
Pilate said,
"I am not a Jew,

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:31.120
am I?
 

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.350
Your own nation and the chief
priests handed you over to me.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:34.240
What have you done?"
 

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.320
Jesus said, "My kingdom
is--"

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.313
Jesus just has a whole
conversation with Pilate which

00:09:38.313 --> 00:09:41.480
leads to that wonderfully
quotable phrase that everybody

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.879
knows about where finally Jesus
talks about truth and Pilate

00:09:44.879 --> 00:09:48.104
says in a phrase that could be
sincere or a lot of people

00:09:48.104 --> 00:09:51.230
answered as being cynical,
"What is truth?"

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.308
Very famous quotation from the
Gospel of John.

00:09:54.308 --> 00:09:57.211
Then of course there's the
whole passage,

00:09:57.211 --> 00:09:59.969
any of you seen
the--"Jesus Christ

00:09:59.969 --> 00:10:03.090
Superstar,"
the play or the movie?

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.907
There's a whole scene where
Herod, this is actually the son

00:10:05.907 --> 00:10:08.917
of Herod the Great now,
but there's a trial before

00:10:08.917 --> 00:10:11.269
Herod also in the Gospel of
John,

00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:14.013
not really in Mark at all,
but in the Gospel of John you

00:10:14.013 --> 00:10:15.808
get this whole trial before
Herod.

00:10:15.808 --> 00:10:17.846
And according to "Jesus
Christ Superstar"

00:10:17.846 --> 00:10:20.168
this is when Herod kind of
dances around on this raft,

00:10:20.168 --> 00:10:22.149
and has showgirls,
and they all do this,

00:10:22.149 --> 00:10:25.451
"so you are the Christ,/
you're the great Jesus Christ,/

00:10:25.451 --> 00:10:28.533
prove to me that you're no
fool,/ walk across my swimming

00:10:28.533 --> 00:10:30.899
pool," and all this sort of
thing.

00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:33.081
There's a whole scene,
and "Jesus Christ

00:10:33.081 --> 00:10:35.163
Superstar"
the whole scene wouldn't be

00:10:35.163 --> 00:10:38.038
possible without the Gospel of
John because it's not in the

00:10:38.038 --> 00:10:39.029
other Gospels.
 

00:10:39.029 --> 00:10:41.399
This is a famous scene.
 

00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:44.889
All of that's different in
John, so what's historical?

00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:47.429
How do scholars decide--you
have these very,

00:10:47.429 --> 00:10:50.679
very different--was Jesus
completely silent at his trial

00:10:50.679 --> 00:10:53.279
as it seems to be in the Gospel
of Mark?

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:56.518
Did he not offer any reasons
for what he did,

00:10:56.518 --> 00:11:00.934
or did he have theological and
philosophical discussions with

00:11:00.934 --> 00:11:03.070
Pilate about his message?
 

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:04.418
What's historical?
 

00:11:04.418 --> 00:11:08.400
In that case,
basically most historians are

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.149
going to say none of it is.
 

00:11:11.149 --> 00:11:15.070
None of the trial stuff can you
be confident would be

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.048
historical.
 

00:11:16.048 --> 00:11:18.485
For one thing,
we just have these very varied

00:11:18.485 --> 00:11:21.750
differences but there's one very
little interesting piece of

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.080
evidence about this.
 

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:29.510
According to all the Gospels
where were the disciples after

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.840
Jesus was arrested?
 

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.669
Anybody remember?
 

00:11:33.669 --> 00:11:36.779
They vamoosed.
 

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:41.230
The Gospels say the disciples
ran away at the arrest of Jesus.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.787
So maybe according to some
traditions--according to these

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:48.279
traditions maybe Peter was there
sort of in a courtyard,

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:50.250
out removed from the trial.
 

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.152
But none of the disciples of
Jesus would have been allowed to

00:11:54.152 --> 00:11:58.119
be present at any trial whether
it was with his high priest or

00:11:58.119 --> 00:12:00.946
Pilate,
they wouldn't have been allowed

00:12:00.946 --> 00:12:01.210
in.
 

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.360
These were peasants from
Galilee, they're fishermen,

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.019
they don't go walking into
Pilate's headquarters,

00:12:06.019 --> 00:12:10.756
so who would have been there to
report these different trial

00:12:10.756 --> 00:12:11.480
things?
 

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.344
There are no stenographers in
the ancient world sitting down

00:12:14.344 --> 00:12:15.850
taking notes of these trials.
 

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:20.168
There are no court records,
there are no journalists,

00:12:20.168 --> 00:12:24.730
nobody was there who later
Christians had access to so that

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:29.370
they could possibly have known
what went on in the trial.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.225
According to most historians
who just say,

00:12:32.225 --> 00:12:35.917
all of this trial stuff was
very much made up by later

00:12:35.917 --> 00:12:36.682
Christians.
 

00:12:36.682 --> 00:12:37.308
Why?
 

00:12:37.308 --> 00:12:40.328
Because they figured you had to
have a trial if you're going to

00:12:40.328 --> 00:12:43.299
have Jesus condemned and so they
figured, well what would have

00:12:43.299 --> 00:12:44.080
taken place?
 

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.788
These Gospel writers,
or maybe they're using

00:12:45.788 --> 00:12:47.418
traditions that developed before
them,

00:12:47.418 --> 00:12:49.873
they're using traditions that
developed because people just

00:12:49.873 --> 00:12:52.615
say,
well what would have happened

00:12:52.615 --> 00:12:54.049
at Jesus' trial?
 

00:12:54.049 --> 00:12:56.048
What's likely to have happened?
 

00:12:56.048 --> 00:12:58.534
Then they make up that
likeliness and they put that

00:12:58.534 --> 00:12:59.379
into the story.
 

00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:03.110
Now so you've got a couple of
different situations where we

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:06.346
historians are very,
very skeptical about some of

00:13:06.346 --> 00:13:09.860
the basic aspects of the
Gospels' accounts as far as what

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.558
they tell us about the
historical Jesus.

00:13:12.558 --> 00:13:17.129
The birth narratives,
we just throw up our hands.

00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:22.004
The trials before Pilate,
nope probably none of it rises

00:13:22.004 --> 00:13:24.308
to the level of history.
 

00:13:24.308 --> 00:13:27.190
This leads to a couple of
different problems.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:30.340
The first one I'm going to talk
about is, so what?

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.264
And I'm saying this because
once critical scholars start

00:13:34.264 --> 00:13:38.190
talking about the historical
Jesus, we immediately start

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.259
stepping into sand traps.
 

00:13:40.259 --> 00:13:45.009
On the one hand we have good
Christian people who are a bit

00:13:45.009 --> 00:13:49.102
afraid that if you start
questioning the historical

00:13:49.102 --> 00:13:54.178
reliability of the Gospels then
you're going to undermine every

00:13:54.178 --> 00:13:56.798
aspect of Christian faith.
 

00:13:56.798 --> 00:14:00.649
If the birth narratives are not
as they say they are in the

00:14:00.649 --> 00:14:04.298
Gospels, then how can you trust
any of it to be true?

00:14:04.298 --> 00:14:07.933
If none of it is true,
how do you even know that Jesus

00:14:07.933 --> 00:14:09.580
actually even existed?
 

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:14.215
Or even if he did exist how do
you know that he wasn't a liar

00:14:14.215 --> 00:14:16.610
or a magician,
or just a bum?

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.370
How do you--and if that's true,
why have faith?

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.970
Why not just give up the whole
thing?

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:26.423
On the one hand,
you've got Christians who are

00:14:26.423 --> 00:14:31.260
very threatened by using typical
historical tools on the Gospels

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.100
and the very question of the
historical Jesus.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.441
On the other hand,
we have just as many people who

00:14:38.441 --> 00:14:42.668
are anti-Christian and they want
to grab onto this and say,

00:14:42.668 --> 00:14:47.178
aha, notice how reputable
scholars like Dale Martin,

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:50.370
Woolsey Professor or Religious
Studies at Yale University,

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:53.339
points out that not everything
in the Gospels is reliably

00:14:53.339 --> 00:14:53.870
history.
 

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.533
Well that means it's all a
bunch of bunk,

00:14:56.533 --> 00:15:00.264
and every Christian in the
world is basing their faith on

00:15:00.264 --> 00:15:03.528
things that are known by
scholars to be lies.

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:07.038
Well that's not exactly right
either is it?

00:15:07.038 --> 00:15:10.230
But on both sides you get some
people who say--

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.575
who grab onto any sort of idea
that historians would say these

00:15:13.575 --> 00:15:15.769
are the discrepancies in the
Gospels,

00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:19.245
or these are places where we
don't have historical evidence

00:15:19.245 --> 00:15:22.961
to back us up and they want to
run with that precisely in order

00:15:22.961 --> 00:15:25.240
to impugn the faith of
Christians.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.710
So scholars have to be very
careful.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:31.123
What we basically want to
say--there was actually one or

00:15:31.123 --> 00:15:33.730
two scholars in the nineteenth
century,

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.279
reputable scholars,
Bruno Bauer was one of them,

00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:39.080
a German scholar who denied
that Jesus ever existed.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.730
He just said it was all--even
the person of Jesus was a myth

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:42.808
created by the church.
 

00:15:42.808 --> 00:15:46.379
You'll find every once in a
while somebody on the web,

00:15:46.379 --> 00:15:50.625
or the internet,
or something or in some crazy

00:15:50.625 --> 00:15:52.827
blog,
saying that Jesus never

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:56.038
existed, but reputable
historical scholars all admit

00:15:56.038 --> 00:15:58.178
that Jesus of Nazareth existed.
 

00:15:58.178 --> 00:16:00.548
There was a guy back there,
Jesus of Nazareth.

00:16:00.548 --> 00:16:03.798
There's just too much evidence
that he existed and it's just

00:16:03.798 --> 00:16:07.490
not controvertible when it comes
to reliable historical evidence.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.720
That's a big difference from
saying,

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.918
yes, we believe he existed and
there are some things we think

00:16:11.918 --> 00:16:14.649
we can say about him,
to accepting all of the Gospel

00:16:14.649 --> 00:16:16.070
materials as reliable.
 

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.847
Scholars basically are caught
in the middle of saying we

00:16:18.847 --> 00:16:20.918
believe there was a Jesus of
Nazareth,

00:16:20.918 --> 00:16:24.812
we believe we might even be
able to say some things as

00:16:24.812 --> 00:16:27.724
historians about who he was,
what he said,

00:16:27.724 --> 00:16:29.919
what he did,
why he may have been executed,

00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:31.580
and that sort of thing.
 

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:35.957
That means we have to use
critical historical tools to

00:16:35.957 --> 00:16:40.808
analyze these faith-based texts,
these theological texts,

00:16:40.808 --> 00:16:43.102
what are indeed,
in some cases,

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:44.279
mythological texts.
 

00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:47.048
We read theological texts to
try to figure out what we could

00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:47.940
say historically.
 

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.908
That leads to the other issue.
 

00:16:49.908 --> 00:16:52.260
I keep saying "the
historical Jesus"

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.344
because a whole lot of people
have the idea that once I give

00:16:55.344 --> 00:16:58.480
you the historical Jesus then
you've got the real Jesus.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.407
You've got Jesus as he really
was and so therefore Jesus as he

00:17:02.407 --> 00:17:03.178
really is.
 

00:17:03.178 --> 00:17:07.066
Now the problem with that is
that theologians and I can put

00:17:07.066 --> 00:17:11.288
on my historical hat most of the
time, because I actually have a

00:17:11.288 --> 00:17:12.828
job as a historian.
 

00:17:12.828 --> 00:17:15.776
I don't really have a job as a
theologian so I kind of a call

00:17:15.776 --> 00:17:17.788
myself sometimes an amateur
theologian.

00:17:17.788 --> 00:17:20.346
If I want to put on my amateur
theologian hat,

00:17:20.346 --> 00:17:23.642
I can make a case for you why
the historical Jesus is not a

00:17:23.642 --> 00:17:26.200
very good foundation for
Christian faith.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.002
It's not reliable as a
foundation of Christian faith,

00:17:29.002 --> 00:17:32.130
it's not sufficient as a
foundation for Christian faith.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:35.246
The theological Jesus,
the Jesus of Christian

00:17:35.246 --> 00:17:38.150
confession is not the historical
Jesus.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.701
The Jesus of theological
confession is the Jesus that

00:17:41.701 --> 00:17:45.457
matches what the church has
traditionally believed about

00:17:45.457 --> 00:17:46.140
Jesus.
 

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.440
For example,
Jesus that matches the creeds,

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.750
a Jesus that matches Christian
confessions,

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.308
so one of the most important
things for Christian confession,

00:17:53.308 --> 00:17:55.527
for example,
is--would you lose your faith

00:17:55.527 --> 00:17:58.664
if you believed that Jesus
wasn't born in Bethlehem but was

00:17:58.664 --> 00:18:00.180
rather born in Nazareth?
 

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.621
Probably most Christians would
say, well, no that's not really

00:18:03.621 --> 00:18:04.578
that important.
 

00:18:04.578 --> 00:18:07.231
What's the most central thing
for most Christians of the

00:18:07.231 --> 00:18:08.098
Christian faith?
 

00:18:08.098 --> 00:18:12.151
Do you believe that somehow God
was in Jesus Christ reconciling

00:18:12.151 --> 00:18:15.401
the world to himself,
to quote the Apostle Paul,

00:18:15.401 --> 00:18:18.440
or do you believe that Jesus
Christ is divine?

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.259
Do you believe that Jesus is
God?

00:18:20.259 --> 00:18:22.711
Do you believe that Jesus is
God incarnate,

00:18:22.711 --> 00:18:23.818
God in the flesh?
 

00:18:23.818 --> 00:18:27.010
That's a fundamental aspect of
Christian faith for most

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:27.778
Christians.
 

00:18:27.778 --> 00:18:30.890
Notice that's not something
that historians can pronounce

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:32.390
about one way or another.
 

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:36.502
There's no possible way that I
practicing history by the normal

00:18:36.502 --> 00:18:40.218
historiographical tools of
history could tell you whether

00:18:40.218 --> 00:18:42.740
God was in Jesus Christ,
is there?

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.430
I mean just think about it,
how would I test that?

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.828
How would I figure it out?
 

00:18:46.828 --> 00:18:49.400
What would count as a positive
proof?

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.098
What would count as a
non-controvertible negative

00:18:52.098 --> 00:18:52.549
truth?
 

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:53.720
There's no such thing.
 

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.604
When I'm talking about the
historical Jesus I have to get

00:18:57.604 --> 00:18:59.200
over several hurdles.
 

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.106
One of the hurdles is trying to
show you that the historical

00:19:03.106 --> 00:19:06.816
Jesus is a construction made by
historians practicing the

00:19:06.816 --> 00:19:09.400
typical trade of modern
historians.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.125
It's just like,
for example,

00:19:11.125 --> 00:19:13.808
if I say what's the historical
Socrates?

00:19:13.808 --> 00:19:17.353
We don't have direct access to
Socrates either,

00:19:17.353 --> 00:19:17.970
right?
 

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.568
Socrates left no writings.
 

00:19:19.568 --> 00:19:23.439
All we know about Socrates are
mainly the things that either

00:19:23.439 --> 00:19:24.721
Plato,
his disciple,

00:19:24.721 --> 00:19:27.652
said about him or Xenophon
another of his disciples said

00:19:27.652 --> 00:19:29.569
about him and a few other
things.

00:19:29.569 --> 00:19:31.798
You know what?
 

00:19:31.798 --> 00:19:34.538
Plato and Xenophon don't give
the same picture of Socrates,

00:19:34.538 --> 00:19:38.000
so figuring out what this--who
is the historical Socrates is

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.403
also a difficult historical
question that historians debate

00:19:41.403 --> 00:19:41.990
about.
 

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:45.670
That's the one thing is just
using typical historical data.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.854
For example,
if I say, we're going to talk

00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:50.837
about George Washington and
we're going to talk about the

00:19:50.837 --> 00:19:53.483
George Washington of history,
the George Washington that

00:19:53.483 --> 00:19:55.980
historians will come up with,
that's a different George

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.972
Washington than say,
let's talk about the George

00:19:58.972 --> 00:20:01.328
Washington of popular American
piety.

00:20:01.328 --> 00:20:04.378
The George Washington of
popular American piety threw a

00:20:04.378 --> 00:20:05.960
dollar across the Potomac.
 

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.590
No historian believes that
George Washington threw a dollar

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.971
across the Potomac,
at least not at Mt.

00:20:11.971 --> 00:20:12.660
Vernon.
 

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.224
If you've been to Mt.
 

00:20:14.224 --> 00:20:17.430
Vernon you know that's a super
human feat.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:20.046
In popular American piety,
George Washington as a little

00:20:20.046 --> 00:20:23.090
boy chopped down the cherry tree
and when his father got onto him

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.358
he said,
I cannot tell a lie father,

00:20:25.358 --> 00:20:25.910
it is I.
 

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.930
That's a George Washington,
it's the George Washington of

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:32.058
American popular tradition,
and it's important to know that

00:20:32.058 --> 00:20:33.568
about George Washington.
 

00:20:33.568 --> 00:20:36.188
No historian believes that
George Washington as a child

00:20:36.188 --> 00:20:39.048
actually chopped down the cherry
tree and that happened,

00:20:39.048 --> 00:20:42.000
and mainly because we actually
found the preacher who made up

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.230
the story for a sermon.
 

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:47.000
It made a good sermon point.
 

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.838
Remember my motto,
what's the motto of the class?

00:20:50.838 --> 00:20:55.253
De omnibus dubitandum,
especially when you're

00:20:55.253 --> 00:20:58.630
listening to preachers or
professors.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:02.953
The historical Jesus is not the
same thing as the theological

00:21:02.953 --> 00:21:05.910
Jesus, so that's one point to
remember.

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.678
Another--this is another
theoretical issue and this is

00:21:08.678 --> 00:21:11.759
very confusing for some people
when you first start thinking

00:21:11.759 --> 00:21:12.440
about it.
 

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.878
We often use the word
"history"

00:21:16.878 --> 00:21:21.538
in two different ways in common
English.

00:21:21.538 --> 00:21:27.118
We often use the word history
to refer simply to stuff in the

00:21:27.118 --> 00:21:27.769
past.
 

00:21:27.769 --> 00:21:33.759
For example,
the Civil War is historical.

00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:36.410
That just means it happened in
the past.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:38.972
That's one way we use the word
"history"

00:21:38.972 --> 00:21:42.821
but it's kind of a sloppy way,
because if I want to say the

00:21:42.821 --> 00:21:47.229
history of the Civil War,
I'm not really talking in that

00:21:47.229 --> 00:21:50.058
case of the whole Civil War,
right?

00:21:50.058 --> 00:21:53.640
A historical account of the
Civil War is something--

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:57.742
is a narrative that will be
constructed by a historian to

00:21:57.742 --> 00:22:01.920
represent a story about whatever
happened in the past,

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.558
but it can't replicate the
past, right?

00:22:04.558 --> 00:22:09.705
In order to replicate the Civil
War you would have to actually

00:22:09.705 --> 00:22:13.838
have the full four years--wasn't
it four years?

00:22:13.838 --> 00:22:17.452
However long the Civil War took
to fight you would have to have

00:22:17.452 --> 00:22:20.308
that amount of time because
every tiny detail,

00:22:20.308 --> 00:22:21.855
every action,
every person,

00:22:21.855 --> 00:22:23.246
every word,
every letter,

00:22:23.246 --> 00:22:25.991
everything anybody said all--
every tiny battle,

00:22:25.991 --> 00:22:30.703
every ant that crawled over a
decomposing corpse is part of

00:22:30.703 --> 00:22:33.058
the past of the Civil War.
 

00:22:33.058 --> 00:22:37.940
That's not the history of the
Civil War, that's the Civil War

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.298
as it occurred in the past.
 

00:22:40.298 --> 00:22:43.959
The history of the Civil War is
an account of whatever happened

00:22:43.959 --> 00:22:47.558
in the past that a historian
constructs and then tells you.

00:22:47.558 --> 00:22:49.329
When we use the word
"history"

00:22:49.329 --> 00:22:50.920
in that more professional
sense,

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.211
we're not talking about the
past, we're talking about an

00:22:54.211 --> 00:22:55.529
account of the past.
 

00:22:55.529 --> 00:22:59.997
Often philosophers of history
like to separate these two words

00:22:59.997 --> 00:23:01.865
out,
and they'll use the word

00:23:01.865 --> 00:23:04.461
"past"
for the event that occurred in

00:23:04.461 --> 00:23:05.140
the past.
 

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.430
They'll use the word
"history"

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:10.720
for an account of the event
that occurred in the past.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.730
Now notice what that means.
 

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.348
Histories are accessible to us,
right?

00:23:15.348 --> 00:23:18.679
You can go to the store and buy
a history of the Civil War,

00:23:18.679 --> 00:23:22.122
you can buy a history of George
Washington, and you can buy a

00:23:22.122 --> 00:23:23.730
history of Jesus Christ.
 

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:27.678
Does the history of the Civil
War that you buy in the store

00:23:27.678 --> 00:23:29.380
give you the Civil War?
 

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:33.779
No, it gives you an account of
the Civil War.

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:37.990
The actual Civil War is
radically inaccessible to you.

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.798
It's inaccessible,
you can't get it.

00:23:39.798 --> 00:23:44.402
Think about this,
how would you actually recover

00:23:44.402 --> 00:23:47.829
the actual past of the Civil
War?

00:23:47.829 --> 00:23:50.618
How would you do it?
 

00:23:50.618 --> 00:23:54.773
Let's say you can't travel in
time like in TV,

00:23:54.773 --> 00:23:58.190
let's just say that
hypothetically.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:01.702
Does the Civil War exist
somewhere in space where the

00:24:01.702 --> 00:24:05.824
light that emitted from it is
still flying off in the universe

00:24:05.824 --> 00:24:06.769
somewhere?
 

00:24:06.769 --> 00:24:08.907
If you could faster,
than the speed of light,

00:24:08.907 --> 00:24:11.824
fly out to that thing you could
actually experience the Civil

00:24:11.824 --> 00:24:13.380
War as it actually happened.
 

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:17.893
Well maybe theoretically,
but for any of us sitting here

00:24:17.893 --> 00:24:21.338
in this room,
that's not possible is it?

00:24:21.338 --> 00:24:25.656
In other words,
this is a radical thought to

00:24:25.656 --> 00:24:31.380
some people, but the past no
longer exists for you and me,

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.788
it's radically gone.
 

00:24:33.788 --> 00:24:40.398
The past is non-existent when
it comes to our experiences of

00:24:40.398 --> 00:24:40.960
it.
 

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.750
All we can experience are
different accounts of the past.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.710
We can experience different
constructions of the past.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.609
We cannot experience the past
itself.

00:24:50.609 --> 00:24:54.298
It's gone;
it's lost to us forever.

00:24:54.298 --> 00:24:59.430
That means the historical
Jesus, as Jesus actually existed

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:02.759
in history, is inaccessible to
you.

00:25:02.759 --> 00:25:05.532
You will not find him,
you cannot find him,

00:25:05.532 --> 00:25:07.250
you will never find him.
 

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:10.740
What you can do is using
the trades--

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.358
the tricks of the trade of
modern historiography,

00:25:14.358 --> 00:25:17.854
you can play by the rules of
modern historiography and you

00:25:17.854 --> 00:25:20.000
can construct a historical
Jesus.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.980
That means a Jesus of Nazareth
constructed using the same kinds

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.867
of historical tools as
historians would use to

00:25:26.867 --> 00:25:29.950
construct the historical George
Washington,

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:33.059
the historical Socrates,
the historical Plato,

00:25:33.059 --> 00:25:35.420
the historical Abraham Lincoln.
 

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:39.180
That's a construction though.
 

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:42.573
Those theoretical points are
very important because when I

00:25:42.573 --> 00:25:45.670
talk about the historical Jesus
you cannot think,

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:49.298
like most popular people think,
that what I'm talking about is

00:25:49.298 --> 00:25:52.280
the real Jesus,
the Jesus as he really was,

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.608
or certainly not the Jesus of
Christian faith.

00:25:55.608 --> 00:25:59.077
What I'm giving you is an
account of Jesus that modern

00:25:59.077 --> 00:26:02.546
historians construct using the
typical tools of modern

00:26:02.546 --> 00:26:03.788
historiography.
 

00:26:03.788 --> 00:26:07.232
That's a lot of theoretical
philosophy of history stuff that

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:10.210
I tried to boil down in
straightforward language.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:14.211
Is there any questions or
comments about that before I go

00:26:14.211 --> 00:26:14.568
on?
 

00:26:14.568 --> 00:26:17.470
All that stuff is necessary,
though,

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.946
because people,
especially when they turn to

00:26:19.946 --> 00:26:21.943
objects of faith,
that you start asking

00:26:21.943 --> 00:26:26.030
historical questions,
people's minds start turning

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:27.160
into mud.
 

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.642
All right, now let's just jump
right in, what could we say

00:26:30.642 --> 00:26:33.269
about the historical Jesus as
historians?

00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:35.950
Today I can't give you the
whole thing.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:41.230
If you want the whole thing,
all the answers to life--

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:44.380
well I won't give you cooking
recipes and that kind of thing,

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:47.401
but if you want all the answers
to historical Jesus stuff as it

00:26:47.401 --> 00:26:50.770
comes from the expert,
moi, you can take my

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:55.392
seminar in the fall that I'll be
teaching on the historical

00:26:55.392 --> 00:26:58.078
Jesus;
a whole semester just on the

00:26:58.078 --> 00:27:02.019
historical Jesus question,
so I'll do that in the fall.

00:27:02.019 --> 00:27:06.528
I'm going to give you the next
twenty minutes a little version

00:27:06.528 --> 00:27:09.403
of sort of the results,
I'll show you some of the

00:27:09.403 --> 00:27:11.204
results that we--
that I would say about the

00:27:11.204 --> 00:27:13.650
historical Jesus and I would
also say that Bart Ehrman,

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:16.586
the author of your textbook,
will agree with most of this in

00:27:16.586 --> 00:27:18.130
his chapter in your textbook.
 

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:20.722
If you want more of that,
Bart Ehrman has a book on the

00:27:20.722 --> 00:27:23.233
historical Jesus called--
I think it's called,

00:27:23.233 --> 00:27:26.148
Jesus of Nazareth or
Apocalyptic Prophet of a New

00:27:26.148 --> 00:27:27.000
Millennium.
 

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
It's also published by Oxford
Press and its several years old,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.150
but he and I agree to a great
extent about this sort of thing.

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:35.874
If you want more of this you
can look at Bart's book and

00:27:35.874 --> 00:27:38.894
it'll pretty much agree with a
lot of the stuff that I'm going

00:27:38.894 --> 00:27:40.939
to say,
or you can take my seminar next

00:27:40.939 --> 00:27:41.220
fall.
 

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.660
Here are some things that I
think we can agree about,

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.717
most historians might agree
about, the historical Jesus and

00:27:47.717 --> 00:27:49.720
then I'll tell you how we got
there.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.654
We're going to talk about first
some results and then some

00:27:51.654 --> 00:27:52.130
methodology.
 

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:58.946
First, the sign on the cross,
does anybody remember what the

00:27:58.946 --> 00:28:04.609
sign on the cross when Jesus is
crucified says?

00:28:04.609 --> 00:28:05.450
Pardon?
 

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:06.319
Student: 
&gt;

00:28:06.319 --> 00:28:07.410
Prof: Say it again.
 

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:08.640
Student: 
&gt;

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.099
Prof: Jesus of Nazareth,
King of the Jews.

00:28:11.099 --> 00:28:12.950
Anybody else?
 

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:13.630
Student: 
&gt;

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:15.170
Prof: What did you say?
 

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:15.858
Student: 
&gt;

00:28:15.858 --> 00:28:18.411
Prof: Not "here
lies" but there's one verse

00:28:18.411 --> 00:28:20.442
that says "this is Jesus of
Nazareth,"

00:28:20.442 --> 00:28:22.864
and it's because the four
different Gospels have slightly

00:28:22.864 --> 00:28:25.242
different wording but they all
have something version of

00:28:25.242 --> 00:28:27.971
"Jesus of Nazareth,
King of the Jews,"

00:28:27.971 --> 00:28:31.143
which is of course why you
sometimes see this abbreviated

00:28:31.143 --> 00:28:33.848
from the Latin,
right?

00:28:33.848 --> 00:28:40.246
If you've seen it in churches,
INRI, have you ever seen that

00:28:40.246 --> 00:28:45.450
on a cross or something like
that in a church?

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:50.461
Jesus of Nazareth in Latin,
rex King

00:28:50.461 --> 00:28:54.160
Iudaeorum of the Jews.
 

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.970
Notice how though it's slightly
different.

00:28:55.970 --> 00:29:00.420
Let's look--if you've got your
Bibles it's Mark 15:26,

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.858
if you've got a parallel
version, I'm going to be looking

00:29:03.858 --> 00:29:07.358
at Throckmorton because it has
the synoptic parallels,

00:29:07.358 --> 00:29:11.041
it's Throckmorton paragraph
249, but somebody put your

00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:12.640
finger on Mark 15:26.
 

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:25.621
It's also Matthew 27:37,
it's also Luke 23:38,

00:29:25.621 --> 00:29:33.410
and it's also John 19:19.
 

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:37.940
Now in Mark 15:26 it says,
"The inscription of the

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:42.134
charge against him read the King
of the Jews,"

00:29:42.134 --> 00:29:43.308
that's it.
 

00:29:43.308 --> 00:29:45.029
Then it goes on about other
stuff.

00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:47.890
Look over right next to it on
Matthew,

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:50.116
it says, "Over his head
they put the charge against him

00:29:50.116 --> 00:29:51.678
said,
'This is Jesus,

00:29:51.678 --> 00:29:56.460
the King of the Jews,'"
so it's slightly different.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:04.747
Luke 23:38, there it is,
"There was also an

00:30:04.747 --> 00:30:10.347
inscription over him,
'This is the King of the

00:30:10.347 --> 00:30:12.798
Jews,'" and who has the
John version?

00:30:12.798 --> 00:30:19.910
John 19:19, did anybody put
their finger on John 19:19?

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:21.968
"Jesus of Nazareth,
King of the Jews,"

00:30:21.968 --> 00:30:24.728
and doesn't it say in John that
it was in different languages or

00:30:24.728 --> 00:30:25.894
am I--
Student: 

00:30:25.894 --> 00:30:27.009
&gt;
 

00:30:27.009 --> 00:30:28.222
Prof: That's right;
Hebrew, Latin,

00:30:28.222 --> 00:30:31.440
and Greek in the Gospel of
John, so that's what we've got.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:36.369
One of the things that most
scholars will say is,

00:30:36.369 --> 00:30:39.349
we think that's historical.
 

00:30:39.349 --> 00:30:41.740
Why do we think it's historical?
 

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.015
Well, for one thing,
it comes from at least two

00:30:45.015 --> 00:30:47.078
independent sources,
right?

00:30:47.078 --> 00:30:49.818
What are the two independent
sources that it comes from?

00:30:49.818 --> 00:30:52.849
It's in all four Gospels but
all four Gospels aren't

00:30:52.849 --> 00:30:54.574
independent sources are they?
 

00:30:54.574 --> 00:30:54.990
Why?
 

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:58.106
Because we believe that Matthew
and Luke used Mark,

00:30:58.106 --> 00:31:00.726
so if Matthew and Luke copied
it from Mark,

00:31:00.726 --> 00:31:02.660
that makes Mark one source.
 

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.660
Did the author of John use the
Gospel of Mark?

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.288
Not according to the theory
we're using in this class.

00:31:08.288 --> 00:31:10.588
Some people might say yes,
some scholars might say yes,

00:31:10.588 --> 00:31:13.380
but in this class we're going
on the theory that the Gospel of

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.848
John probably didn't use Mark as
one of his sources.

00:31:15.848 --> 00:31:18.308
You've got the Gospel of John
as one source for this;

00:31:18.308 --> 00:31:20.940
you've got the Gospel of Mark
as another source for this,

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.344
so you have two of what
scholars are willing to treat as

00:31:23.344 --> 00:31:25.766
independent sources,
which both have this nice

00:31:25.766 --> 00:31:29.068
little piece of data,
this data right there.

00:31:29.068 --> 00:31:31.280
Now the other thing is
that--might be interesting for

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:34.182
you to know,
"King of the Jews"

00:31:34.182 --> 00:31:39.112
is not a Christological title
that early Christians used about

00:31:39.112 --> 00:31:39.838
Jesus.
 

00:31:39.838 --> 00:31:43.853
Remember in the Gospels we've
seen a lot of different titles

00:31:43.853 --> 00:31:44.670
for Jesus.
 

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:47.011
He's the teacher,
he's the Son of God,

00:31:47.011 --> 00:31:49.987
he's the Messiah,
he's the Holy one of Israel we

00:31:49.987 --> 00:31:50.808
just saw.
 

00:31:50.808 --> 00:31:53.820
He was a lot of things,
and these things are obviously

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.909
things--
early Christians call him Lord,

00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:59.643
they called him Son of God,
but they didn't call him King

00:31:59.643 --> 00:32:00.680
of the Jews.
 

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:04.325
It was one of the titles of
Jesus that apparently the

00:32:04.325 --> 00:32:07.690
earliest followers of Jesus
didn't latch onto.

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:10.807
So we don't see it in the
letters of Paul and we don't see

00:32:10.807 --> 00:32:12.450
it elsewhere in the Gospels.
 

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:14.598
So what scholars have said is,
look,

00:32:14.598 --> 00:32:17.547
this thing King of the Jews
doesn't look like a

00:32:17.547 --> 00:32:21.134
Christological confessional
title that Christians made up

00:32:21.134 --> 00:32:23.250
and then put into the Gospel.
 

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:28.492
It goes against the tendency of
the Christian writers themselves

00:32:28.492 --> 00:32:31.740
because it's not one of their
titles.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:33.537
If it had said,
"This is Jesus of

00:32:33.537 --> 00:32:35.377
Nazareth,
the Lord of heaven and

00:32:35.377 --> 00:32:37.608
earth," then scholars would
say,

00:32:37.608 --> 00:32:39.180
well that sounds like a
Christian confession.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.585
But saying, "Jesus of
Nazareth, King of the

00:32:41.585 --> 00:32:44.808
Jews," doesn't sound like a
Christian confession so it goes

00:32:44.808 --> 00:32:47.727
against the tendency of the
writers themselves and then we

00:32:47.727 --> 00:32:49.172
say,
well maybe then it's

00:32:49.172 --> 00:32:51.817
historical, maybe it's a little
glimpse of history sitting in

00:32:51.817 --> 00:32:53.500
there,
so that's one thing.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.977
The sign on the cross,
most scholars say that's

00:32:56.977 --> 00:32:57.960
historical.
 

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.680
Now I'll talk about why that's
important;

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.760
it's a very small detail but it
could be very important.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.140
Yes sir?
 

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:08.028
Student: 
&gt;

00:33:08.028 --> 00:33:09.798
Prof: It could have,
exactly.

00:33:09.798 --> 00:33:11.904
In other words in the--the
questions was,

00:33:11.904 --> 00:33:14.799
didn't this come from the
mocking terms in the trial?

00:33:14.799 --> 00:33:15.818
That's exactly right.
 

00:33:15.818 --> 00:33:17.575
The Christians,
if you notice,

00:33:17.575 --> 00:33:21.268
it's the people who are mocking
Jesus who call him King of the

00:33:21.268 --> 00:33:24.434
Jews and so why--
this is not something that the

00:33:24.434 --> 00:33:27.721
Christians writers want to
invent and then put in the

00:33:27.721 --> 00:33:28.288
story.
 

00:33:28.288 --> 00:33:33.037
That supports that point,
so that is a nice little

00:33:33.037 --> 00:33:33.910
detail.
 

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:38.026
One other thing that scholars
often say may well be

00:33:38.026 --> 00:33:42.390
historical: Jesus was baptized
by John the Baptist.

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:45.568
Why would scholars say this is
historical?

00:33:45.568 --> 00:33:49.750
Well there's not complete
agreement about how it happened.

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:53.492
The Gospel of John doesn't
exactly tell you about the

00:33:53.492 --> 00:33:58.029
baptism of Jesus by John but it
has Jesus and his disciples,

00:33:58.029 --> 00:34:00.558
also baptized in the Jordan,
and it has Jesus very much

00:34:00.558 --> 00:34:03.509
connected to John the Baptist in
the beginning of its Gospel.

00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:06.976
The other Gospels do have Jesus
baptized by John,

00:34:06.976 --> 00:34:09.719
but notice how the story goes
along.

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:14.846
All of the writers who have
Jesus baptized by John the

00:34:14.846 --> 00:34:17.367
Baptist,
they have Jesus come to John

00:34:17.367 --> 00:34:19.920
the Baptist and they say I want
to be baptized,

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:23.230
and John the Baptist says,
oh no I shouldn't baptize you,

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:27.820
you're the big kahuna,
you're bigger then I am.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:31.099
I'm not worthy to untie your
sandals,

00:34:31.099 --> 00:34:33.190
so I should be baptized by you,
you shouldn't--

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:35.530
I shouldn't be baptizing you
and Jesus says,

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:38.150
no, no, no, it's okay baptize
me and so he does it and then

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:40.952
you have the confession and the
voice from heaven and that sort

00:34:40.952 --> 00:34:41.539
of thing.
 

00:34:41.539 --> 00:34:43.909
Notice what's going on here.
 

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:48.217
The Gospel writers are very
concerned because they know that

00:34:48.217 --> 00:34:52.527
it could be interpreted that
John baptizing Jesus makes John

00:34:52.527 --> 00:34:56.690
superior to Jesus and makes
Jesus a disciple of John.

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:59.643
And they're not comfortable
with that because of course they

00:34:59.643 --> 00:35:02.597
believed Jesus is the Messiah
and so he's therefore superior

00:35:02.597 --> 00:35:05.655
to John the Baptist,
and John the Baptist was just a

00:35:05.655 --> 00:35:07.579
prophet or a precursor to Jesus.
 

00:35:07.579 --> 00:35:12.465
The story is told to play down
this baptism a bit and make

00:35:12.465 --> 00:35:16.409
Jesus come out as insisting on
the baptism,

00:35:16.409 --> 00:35:20.472
wanting to do it for the right
kinds of reasons but not making

00:35:20.472 --> 00:35:22.268
Jesus a disciple of John.
 

00:35:22.268 --> 00:35:25.918
And also this tradition about
the baptism of Jesus is in

00:35:25.918 --> 00:35:28.440
different sources in different
ways.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:32.005
Again, scholars say,
the baptism of John the Baptist

00:35:32.005 --> 00:35:36.130
baptizing Jesus doesn't look
like something early Christians

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:37.389
would make up.
 

00:35:37.389 --> 00:35:40.509
In fact, you can even see that
they try to tone down its

00:35:40.509 --> 00:35:41.360
implications.
 

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.570
It's not something they're
likely to make up,

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:47.380
it kind of goes against their
tradition of raising Jesus up

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.333
completely,
and therefore,

00:35:49.333 --> 00:35:50.960
it may be historical.
 

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.210
Notice what we've got then.
 

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:55.349
We've got two very small
details that a lot of scholars

00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:58.373
would say probably are
historical because they seemed

00:35:58.373 --> 00:36:02.036
to be witnessed by more than one
source and they also seem to go

00:36:02.036 --> 00:36:05.349
against the theological tendency
of the documents in which

00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:06.630
they're found.
 

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.130
And they frame the Gospel of
Jesus.

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:12.784
The baptism of Jesus,
the beginning of his ministry,

00:36:12.784 --> 00:36:16.655
and the charge on the cross at
the end of his ministry,

00:36:16.655 --> 00:36:19.018
and now I'm going to back up.
 

00:36:19.018 --> 00:36:21.514
Those two events,
let's just say I'm going to

00:36:21.514 --> 00:36:25.146
argue that those two are certain
historical events in the life of

00:36:25.146 --> 00:36:26.925
Jesus,
and then we'll fill in some of

00:36:26.925 --> 00:36:27.889
the other details later.
 

00:36:27.889 --> 00:36:30.429
Right now let's talk about
method, how did I get here?

00:36:30.429 --> 00:36:32.385
First method,
first little rule,

00:36:32.385 --> 00:36:36.045
and this is something that a
lot of people use when they do

00:36:36.045 --> 00:36:37.940
historical Jesus research.
 

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.596
It took all of the twentieth
century for people kind of to

00:36:40.596 --> 00:36:43.577
develop these rules and to spell
them out in scholarship but this

00:36:43.577 --> 00:36:45.070
is kind of where we are now.
 

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:47.460
The first rule,
multiple attestation,

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:59.949
that means when you have more
than one independent source that

00:36:59.949 --> 00:37:02.860
has a saying or an event about
Jesus,

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.480
you tend to give it a little
more weight.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:08.869
Now of course what are
independent sources?

00:37:08.869 --> 00:37:12.193
If you have something in both
Matthew and Luke that doesn't

00:37:12.193 --> 00:37:14.599
count as two independent
sources, right?

00:37:14.599 --> 00:37:16.820
Because both Matthew and Luke
could have gotten it from Mark

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.289
or they could have gotten it
from Q,

00:37:18.289 --> 00:37:23.114
but if you have something in
Mark and you have something in

00:37:23.114 --> 00:37:25.079
John,
well those are two independent

00:37:25.079 --> 00:37:25.469
sources.
 

00:37:25.469 --> 00:37:28.291
If you also have something in
the Gospel of Thomas then most

00:37:28.291 --> 00:37:30.931
of us scholars would say,
well some people say the Gospel

00:37:30.931 --> 00:37:32.820
of Thomas may have known the
other Gospels,

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:35.346
but most of us would say,
we're going to treat him as an

00:37:35.346 --> 00:37:38.148
independent source because he's
not verbatim quoting the other

00:37:38.148 --> 00:37:39.480
Gospels most of the time.
 

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:43.192
If you have an event or a
saying that occurs in Mark and

00:37:43.192 --> 00:37:46.635
John, and Q, and Thomas those
are three [correction:

00:37:46.635 --> 00:37:48.659
four]
independent sources.

00:37:48.659 --> 00:37:51.010
What if it also occurs in Paul,
Paul's letters?

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:52.010
There's another independent
source.

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:55.373
As we'll see there are some
places where Paul gives us a

00:37:55.373 --> 00:37:57.210
little clue about something.
 

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:00.579
Then obviously you can take Q
as being one of those sources,

00:38:00.579 --> 00:38:03.809
so if something is in both
Matthew and Luke but it's not in

00:38:03.809 --> 00:38:07.463
Mark then you can say it's in Q,
and sometimes people would even

00:38:07.463 --> 00:38:10.978
say you have one form of parable
that seems to have occurred in Q

00:38:10.978 --> 00:38:14.440
and you have a different form of
that parable that seems to have

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:15.650
occurred in Mark.
 

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:18.626
Then you can say,
okay we have this one parable

00:38:18.626 --> 00:38:21.942
in two independent sources,
one is Q and one is Mark,

00:38:21.942 --> 00:38:25.014
but that's kind of complicated
because of course the very

00:38:25.014 --> 00:38:28.307
definition of what's in Q is
something that's in both Matthew

00:38:28.307 --> 00:38:30.860
and Luke but not in Mark,
usually.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:34.413
If something is in more than
one source it fits this

00:38:34.413 --> 00:38:35.250
criterion.
 

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:39.862
Now remember criteria is the
plural, criterion is the

00:38:39.862 --> 00:38:40.840
singular.
 

00:38:48.199 --> 00:38:50.630
Let me illustrate this again.
 

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:53.514
One of the things is the sign
on the cross,

00:38:53.514 --> 00:38:56.469
the divorce sayings is another
situation.

00:38:56.469 --> 00:39:00.699
According to Mark 10 and
Matthew 19 you have this saying,

00:39:00.699 --> 00:39:03.253
"What God has joined
together let no man put

00:39:03.253 --> 00:39:05.541
asunder,"
and then you have a few other

00:39:05.541 --> 00:39:06.179
sayings.
 

00:39:06.179 --> 00:39:07.860
Clearly Jesus,
in this passage,

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:11.164
is teaching no divorce for his
disciples, no divorce at all,

00:39:11.164 --> 00:39:13.179
period, none,
against the rule to get

00:39:13.179 --> 00:39:14.018
divorced.
 

00:39:14.018 --> 00:39:17.960
Then Matthew 5:32 has a
parallel with Luke 16:18 which

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:22.349
makes it look like a Q source
and that has this wording,

00:39:22.349 --> 00:39:25.150
"Every man who divorces
his wife and marries another

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:27.628
commits adultery,
and whoever marries a woman who

00:39:27.628 --> 00:39:30.349
has been divorced by her husband
commits adultery."

00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:31.920
In other words,
there's another teaching on

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.931
divorce here,
both of which forbid--it also

00:39:33.931 --> 00:39:37.237
forbids divorce and remarriage,
but it's not the same wording

00:39:37.237 --> 00:39:38.942
as in Mark,
so scholars say,

00:39:38.942 --> 00:39:42.300
that looks like a Q saying on
divorce in which Jesus still

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:45.952
forbids divorce and remarriage
but it's not the same wording as

00:39:45.952 --> 00:39:49.469
the Mark saying,
so we have two separate sayings

00:39:49.469 --> 00:39:52.369
and different wordings,
but they both have Jesus

00:39:52.369 --> 00:39:55.719
forbidding divorce,
at least divorce and remarriage;

00:39:55.719 --> 00:39:58.989
one in Q, one in Mark,
two independent sources.

00:39:58.989 --> 00:40:03.237
It's really neat then when we
find Paul in 1 Corinthians

00:40:03.237 --> 00:40:05.956
7:10-11 says this,
so this is Paul,

00:40:05.956 --> 00:40:09.172
a quotation from Paul,
"To those who are married

00:40:09.172 --> 00:40:11.739
I command,"
that is Paul and then he says,

00:40:11.739 --> 00:40:13.670
"Not I but the Lord."
 

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:18.518
Paul even knows he's quoting a
saying of the Lord Jesus,

00:40:18.518 --> 00:40:20.567
so he goes onto say,
"That the woman must not

00:40:20.567 --> 00:40:23.260
separate from her husband,
if indeed she does separate let

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.889
her remain unmarried or be
reconciled to her husband,

00:40:25.889 --> 00:40:28.110
and a man must not put away his
wife."

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:30.510
Now most of us believe that's
Paul's wording because you can

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:32.791
tell the way he's kind of
fudging around with some of the

00:40:32.791 --> 00:40:33.849
details of the saying.
 

00:40:33.849 --> 00:40:38.286
At least Paul gives a witness
that he knows of an anti-divorce

00:40:38.286 --> 00:40:39.960
saying by Jesus also.
 

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:44.885
Three separate independent
witnesses that Jesus taught

00:40:44.885 --> 00:40:46.559
against divorce.
 

00:40:46.559 --> 00:40:51.170
One from Mark that Matthew
copies, one from Q that both

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:54.585
Matthew and Luke have,
and one from Paul,

00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:58.768
so that passes the multiple
attestation rule.

00:40:58.768 --> 00:41:02.829
It also passes the next rule,
which is dissimilarity.

00:41:07.889 --> 00:41:10.320
When you find something in a
source,

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:13.909
the early Christian source,
that seems to go against the

00:41:13.909 --> 00:41:16.260
very inclinations of that
source,

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:19.791
or of early Christianity,
it's more likely to be

00:41:19.791 --> 00:41:20.768
historical.
 

00:41:20.768 --> 00:41:25.025
Something that swims against
the tide of early Christian

00:41:25.025 --> 00:41:26.110
expectation.
 

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:29.230
Now why does the--divorce
saying is multiply attest--

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:31.757
it also passes the
dissimilarity thing because

00:41:31.757 --> 00:41:34.356
almost all of these authors,
except for Mark,

00:41:34.356 --> 00:41:37.083
they both seem to know that
Jesus prohibited divorce

00:41:37.083 --> 00:41:40.402
entirely but then they go on to
modify the rule a bit because I

00:41:40.402 --> 00:41:42.809
mean let's face it people get
divorced,

00:41:42.809 --> 00:41:44.739
early Christians got divorced.
 

00:41:44.739 --> 00:41:46.882
So Paul says,
well you're not supposed to get

00:41:46.882 --> 00:41:49.510
divorced, but if you do get
divorced then you should do

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.949
this.
 

00:41:49.949 --> 00:41:55.300
The very writers who pass on an
anti-divorce saying also fudged

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:59.405
the saying just a bit,
which shows that the saying is

00:41:59.405 --> 00:42:02.000
more radical than their own
ethics are.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.492
In other words,
the anti-divorce saying is

00:42:04.492 --> 00:42:08.199
dissimilar to the very practices
of these early Christians.

00:42:08.199 --> 00:42:11.514
It's more radical then they are
themselves practicing and that's

00:42:11.514 --> 00:42:14.460
a clue that the saying itself
goes back to the historical

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:16.949
Jesus,
according to this method.

00:42:16.949 --> 00:42:21.556
Dissimilarity is any kind of
thing that doesn't fit early

00:42:21.556 --> 00:42:23.449
Christian tendencies.
 

00:42:23.449 --> 00:42:25.353
The sign on the cross,
I already talked about that,

00:42:25.353 --> 00:42:26.650
it wasn't a confession of
Jesus.

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:29.190
The baptism of John,
it's not something they likely

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:30.309
would have invented.
 

00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:33.250
There's another one,
the swords at Jesus' arrest,

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:36.956
and according to Mark 14:47 and
it's followed by Matthew and

00:42:36.956 --> 00:42:39.621
Luke,
somebody had a sword at Jesus'

00:42:39.621 --> 00:42:43.429
arrest in the garden,
and somebody used it.

00:42:43.429 --> 00:42:45.719
According to the different
traditions it was Peter,

00:42:45.719 --> 00:42:47.789
according to John and somebody
made--

00:42:47.789 --> 00:42:50.780
the others don't name,
somebody whacked off the high--

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.719
the ear of the high priest's
slave,

00:42:52.719 --> 00:42:57.077
but there are these different
stories about somebody in Jesus'

00:42:57.077 --> 00:43:00.650
entourage was armed and in some
of the sources--

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:02.239
one of the sources there are
two of them--

00:43:02.239 --> 00:43:04.500
or there were two
swords--others say one sword.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.090
Now I think this is historical.
 

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:07.510
Why?
 

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:10.710
Because all the Gospel writers
want to go out of their way to

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:13.380
say Jesus was not mounting a
violent revolution.

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:15.969
He was not a criminal,
this was not an armed

00:43:15.969 --> 00:43:19.525
rebellion, he is completely
innocent of any political charge

00:43:19.525 --> 00:43:20.730
of insurrection.
 

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:25.056
But if Jesus' disciples were
armed with swords at his arrest,

00:43:25.056 --> 00:43:29.094
in the middle of the night,
at the Passover in Jerusalem,

00:43:29.094 --> 00:43:31.329
that's insurrection,
folks.

00:43:31.329 --> 00:43:35.146
The Romans did not allow Jews
just to go around in the middle

00:43:35.146 --> 00:43:37.820
of the night in gardens carrying
swords.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.030
For a Jew to be armed,
at the Passover,

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:44.005
an especially dangerous time,
that the Romans were really

00:43:44.005 --> 00:43:46.438
worried about,
for a Jew to be armed following

00:43:46.438 --> 00:43:49.346
around a guy who some people
were saying was the King of the

00:43:49.346 --> 00:43:52.259
Jews,
you can be arrested for that,

00:43:52.259 --> 00:43:54.900
you can be crucified for that.
 

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:58.179
I don't think early Christians
invented it.

00:43:58.179 --> 00:44:02.255
I think some of these early
Christians knew that at least

00:44:02.255 --> 00:44:06.478
one and possibly more of Jesus'
disciples were armed at his

00:44:06.478 --> 00:44:07.280
arrest.
 

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.590
Why do I think that?
 

00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:09.780
Because it's not something they
would have invented.

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.789
In fact, it goes against their
tendency.

00:44:11.789 --> 00:44:17.726
There's another passage,
Mark 10:18 which is also in

00:44:17.726 --> 00:44:19.239
Luke 18:19.
 

00:44:19.239 --> 00:44:22.260
You may have come across this,
the man comes and asks Jesus

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:24.710
about what should I do to have
eternal life,

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:25.909
what's the good thing for me to
do,

00:44:25.909 --> 00:44:28.697
and Jesus says,
why do you ask me about the

00:44:28.697 --> 00:44:33.239
good,
there's no one good but God.

00:44:33.239 --> 00:44:37.429
Now, apparently,
Mark writing that didn't have a

00:44:37.429 --> 00:44:42.869
theological hiccup but now let
me--I'm a good Episcopalian.

00:44:42.869 --> 00:44:48.556
Why should you ask Jesus about
the good, God's the only who is

00:44:48.556 --> 00:44:49.210
good.
 

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:51.920
Sound weird?
 

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:57.190
If Jesus is actually God then
you wouldn't say it like that.

00:44:57.190 --> 00:45:01.389
In other words,
this sounds like Jesus himself

00:45:01.389 --> 00:45:03.909
is denying that he's God.
 

00:45:03.909 --> 00:45:07.552
Don't ask me about the good,
the only one who knows about

00:45:07.552 --> 00:45:11.130
good is God, and Jesus goes and
answers the question.

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:14.735
I think this saying was
actually--something like this

00:45:14.735 --> 00:45:16.954
was said by the historical
Jesus.

00:45:16.954 --> 00:45:17.510
Why?
 

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:20.905
Because early followers of
Jesus believed Jesus was God in

00:45:20.905 --> 00:45:21.679
some sense.
 

00:45:21.679 --> 00:45:24.429
I don't think this is something
they would invent.

00:45:24.429 --> 00:45:27.300
It goes against their
confession.

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:31.143
It goes against their theology,
so it's one of these cases

00:45:31.143 --> 00:45:33.840
where it's dissimilar to their
faith,

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:38.123
and therefore,
we tend to give it a higher

00:45:38.123 --> 00:45:41.989
grade when it comes to
historicity.

00:45:41.989 --> 00:45:45.300
A couple of other criteria are
a bit weaker,

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.610
these are the two strongest.
 

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:52.219
Social coherence.
 

00:45:52.219 --> 00:45:55.646
This is when you say--when you
use something that is either

00:45:55.646 --> 00:45:59.072
anachronistic and it doesn't
look like it would fit in with

00:45:59.072 --> 00:46:02.500
the life of Jesus or it does fit
very well with the life of

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:03.210
Jesus.
 

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:04.259
If I decide,
for example,

00:46:04.259 --> 00:46:06.664
on lots of different other
sayings that I've decided are

00:46:06.664 --> 00:46:08.719
historical because of these
other reasons,

00:46:08.719 --> 00:46:11.286
and then something looks like
it--a saying of Jesus looks like

00:46:11.286 --> 00:46:13.601
it's apocalyptic and I've
already established that Jesus

00:46:13.601 --> 00:46:16.811
was an apocalyptic prophet,
then I'm going to say well it

00:46:16.811 --> 00:46:19.827
coheres with the social
situation of Jesus as an

00:46:19.827 --> 00:46:22.010
apocalyptic prophet in Galilee.
 

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:25.594
Or take a negative example,
in Matthew 18 there are a lot

00:46:25.594 --> 00:46:28.860
of rules about what you should
do in the church,

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:30.356
the very word
"church"

00:46:30.356 --> 00:46:30.840
is used.
 

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.760
Almost all of us scholars would
say a lot of that stuff in

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.983
Matthew 18 about the church,
the church rules,

00:46:35.983 --> 00:46:39.320
the church leadership,
that's not historical. Why?

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.039
Because the church didn't exist
in Jesus' lifetime.

00:46:42.039 --> 00:46:45.992
Jesus sounds like he's giving
rules about a constitution for a

00:46:45.992 --> 00:46:48.780
church but we think that's
anachronistic.

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.817
The church is something that
developed after Jesus' death

00:46:51.817 --> 00:46:54.909
when his followers came to
believe that he had been raised

00:46:54.909 --> 00:46:58.056
from the dead and then they
should continue doing things in

00:46:58.056 --> 00:46:58.869
his name.
 

00:46:58.869 --> 00:47:01.659
In Jesus' own lifetime,
traveling around Galilee,

00:47:01.659 --> 00:47:04.148
talking about--now when you
have the church you should meet

00:47:04.148 --> 00:47:06.364
on Sundays,
I think for Easter you should

00:47:06.364 --> 00:47:11.369
wear white--
Jesus didn't do this sort of

00:47:11.369 --> 00:47:12.440
thing.
 

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:16.393
All of that stuff in Matthew 18
that looks very much like later

00:47:16.393 --> 00:47:19.233
church life,
we believe was read back into

00:47:19.233 --> 00:47:23.130
the life of Jesus by the author
of Matthew or other people.

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:26.907
Then the last thing is,
the last criterion is rather

00:47:26.907 --> 00:47:30.389
weak, it's called the criterion
of coherence.

00:47:30.389 --> 00:47:33.989
This basically just says,
if you've established something

00:47:33.989 --> 00:47:37.460
as being historical about Jesus
by these other stronger

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.844
criteria,
and then something else seems

00:47:39.844 --> 00:47:42.474
to cohere with it,
then you can kind of throw it

00:47:42.474 --> 00:47:43.139
in the pot.
 

00:47:43.139 --> 00:47:48.514
It's a very loose kind of
criterion to use for historical

00:47:48.514 --> 00:47:49.570
purposes.
 

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:51.400
Now--so where are we?
 

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.280
That's the methodology.
 

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.974
If we're going to come up with
some basic ideas about Jesus

00:47:55.974 --> 00:47:58.159
here's where I would say I would
end up with.

00:47:58.159 --> 00:48:01.030
There's some of this that's
very controversial.

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:03.302
I would say,
though, that Jesus was an

00:48:03.302 --> 00:48:06.559
apocalyptic prophet,
an apocalyptic Jewish prophet.

00:48:06.559 --> 00:48:10.141
One of the reasons is that
Jesus' life was framed by two

00:48:10.141 --> 00:48:11.510
apocalyptic events.
 

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:14.139
If Jesus was baptized by John
the Baptist,

00:48:14.139 --> 00:48:16.748
and John the Baptist seems
clearly to have been preaching

00:48:16.748 --> 00:48:19.590
some kind of apocalyptic message
about the coming kingdom,

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:22.096
that means I think,
that Jesus was originally a

00:48:22.096 --> 00:48:24.927
follower of John the Baptist,
although the later Gospel

00:48:24.927 --> 00:48:26.190
writers will play that down.
 

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:29.650
If Jesus was a follower of an
apocalyptic Jewish prophet I

00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:32.443
think that,
at least the beginning of his

00:48:32.443 --> 00:48:34.793
own ministry,
was wreathed in that

00:48:34.793 --> 00:48:37.750
apocalyptic Jewish prophecy kind
of world,

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:43.025
and he was executed on a charge
of sedition as being the King of

00:48:43.025 --> 00:48:45.449
the Jews,
against the law.

00:48:45.449 --> 00:48:47.929
Only the Roman senate got to
make kings,

00:48:47.929 --> 00:48:50.550
and if Jesus was going around
claiming--

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:51.920
and I'm not saying he was
claiming,

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.275
but if other people were
claiming that he was the King of

00:48:54.275 --> 00:48:56.387
the Jews,
the only way to understand that

00:48:56.387 --> 00:48:59.295
I think in this situation is
that he believed that he was

00:48:59.295 --> 00:49:02.253
going to be the Messiah that
would come at the end of time

00:49:02.253 --> 00:49:03.809
and overthrow the Romans.
 

00:49:03.809 --> 00:49:07.469
So his death was also
apocalyptic.

00:49:07.469 --> 00:49:09.539
The temple incident,
we could talk about that,

00:49:09.539 --> 00:49:12.253
did Jesus go in and throw the
money changers out and cleanse

00:49:12.253 --> 00:49:13.449
the temple as it said?
 

00:49:13.449 --> 00:49:14.590
I think that's historical.
 

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:18.117
It goes against the tendency of
the Gospels to portray Jesus as

00:49:18.117 --> 00:49:20.849
violent and confrontational in
that last week.

00:49:20.849 --> 00:49:22.969
I think he therefore did it.
 

00:49:22.969 --> 00:49:24.090
What did it mean?
 

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:25.659
I think it--this is more
debatable,

00:49:25.659 --> 00:49:29.079
I think it was a prophecy meant
to enact what he saw would be

00:49:29.079 --> 00:49:32.670
the coming future destruction of
the temple by God and some kind

00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:35.179
of apocalyptic event at the end
of time.

00:49:35.179 --> 00:49:40.769
I think Jesus was therefore a
lower class Jewish peasant who

00:49:40.769 --> 00:49:42.949
spoke mainly Aramaic.
 

00:49:42.949 --> 00:49:46.429
I think he had a group of
disciples of twelve,

00:49:46.429 --> 00:49:49.440
I won't go into some of these,
but I think he actually did

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:52.449
form twelve of his disciples to
be an inner core group.

00:49:52.449 --> 00:49:54.170
I think even that's apocalyptic.
 

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:56.199
Why would he have twelve
disciples?

00:49:56.199 --> 00:49:57.570
Why did he choose the number
twelve?

00:49:57.570 --> 00:50:00.418
Because there were twelve
tribes of Israel that would be

00:50:00.418 --> 00:50:03.889
reconstituted at the end of time
according to Jewish expectation.

00:50:03.889 --> 00:50:07.646
I think there are also women
that were part of his inner

00:50:07.646 --> 00:50:09.800
circle,
and this is because women later

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:12.364
in early Christianity were
marginalized from leadership

00:50:12.364 --> 00:50:14.239
positions,
but there's all kinds of

00:50:14.239 --> 00:50:16.460
evidence from the resurrection
narratives,

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:19.057
to the presence of Mary
Magdalene, to other women that

00:50:19.057 --> 00:50:21.510
they were part of his inner
circle of disciples.

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:25.016
I think that he never taught
the end of the Jewish law but I

00:50:25.016 --> 00:50:28.226
think he did teach what was
something of a liberalizing

00:50:28.226 --> 00:50:30.010
version of the Jewish law.
 

00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:33.324
In other words,
that the ethical treatment of

00:50:33.324 --> 00:50:37.920
your fellow human beings counted
as more important than actual

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:41.010
details of observing the Jewish
law,

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:43.559
such as keeping kosher,
washing your hands,

00:50:43.559 --> 00:50:45.070
keeping the Sabbath.
 

00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:48.190
Did Jesus think he was the
Messiah?

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:50.409
I think this is a really big
problem.

00:50:50.409 --> 00:50:51.429
I don't know.
 

00:50:51.429 --> 00:50:54.963
There seem to be places where
he makes no open claim to

00:50:54.963 --> 00:50:58.628
Messiahship in his ministry,
except in the Gospel of John

00:50:58.628 --> 00:50:59.480
remember.
 

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.143
So the Gospel of John actually
we tend to treat that as less

00:51:02.143 --> 00:51:04.762
historically reliable in these
things because it looks very

00:51:04.762 --> 00:51:07.110
much more like Christian
theological confession.

00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:11.583
In the Synoptic Gospels,
Jesus doesn't make open claims

00:51:11.583 --> 00:51:13.489
to being the Messiah.
 

00:51:13.489 --> 00:51:16.237
On the other hand,
he was executed for being King

00:51:16.237 --> 00:51:17.039
of the Jews.
 

00:51:17.039 --> 00:51:20.501
The Romans at least thought he
was claiming to be the Messiah,

00:51:20.501 --> 00:51:23.735
or they thought that other
people were claiming that about

00:51:23.735 --> 00:51:24.190
him.
 

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:27.460
What he thought himself is very
difficult.

00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:29.684
One of the things,
though, and I think we can say

00:51:29.684 --> 00:51:31.768
for sure, and this is where I'll
end today.

00:51:31.768 --> 00:51:35.855
Jesus, himself,
I believe, never saw himself as

00:51:35.855 --> 00:51:38.518
the founder of Christianity.
 

00:51:38.518 --> 00:51:43.110
He didn't think about himself
as starting a new religion.

00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:47.501
I believe he saw himself as
preparing the people of Israel

00:51:47.501 --> 00:51:51.815
to make them ready for the
apocalyptic in-breaking of God

00:51:51.815 --> 00:51:55.130
that was to happen at the end of
time,

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:58.858
or at the end of our time,
and the setting up of a new

00:51:58.858 --> 00:52:02.346
time of the Kingdom of God,
the Kingdom of Israel that

00:52:02.346 --> 00:52:04.199
would incorporate the whole
world.

00:52:04.199 --> 00:52:08.253
The way I would do this is
Jesus was an apocalyptic Jewish

00:52:08.253 --> 00:52:12.518
prophet who was executed because
the Romans at least believed

00:52:12.518 --> 00:52:16.784
that he or his disciples were
making dangerous claims that he

00:52:16.784 --> 00:52:18.989
was the King of the Jews.
 

00:52:18.989 --> 00:52:21.980
That's all you get on the
historical Jesus,

00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:22.550
sorry.
 

00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:25.039
Next time we start on Paul.
 

00:52:25.039 --> 00:52:27.690
See you next time.

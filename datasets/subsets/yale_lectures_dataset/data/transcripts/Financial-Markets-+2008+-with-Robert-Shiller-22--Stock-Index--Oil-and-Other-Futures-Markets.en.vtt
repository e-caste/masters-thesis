00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.790
Professor Robert
Shiller: First thing,

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.778
I wanted just to--I forgot to
show--I don't know how exciting

00:00:06.778 --> 00:00:08.720
this is, but this is a ticker
tape.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.974
They weren't brown.
This tape is about a

00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:16.491
half-century old.
It came from the attic of the

00:00:16.491 --> 00:00:19.792
New York Stock Exchange.
When I was at a conference

00:00:19.792 --> 00:00:22.350
there a year ago,
I mentioned to the vice

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.994
president there that I had told
my class about ticker tape

00:00:25.994 --> 00:00:29.703
machines and they had never
heard of them--didn't know what

00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:31.916
they were;
well, at least some of them

00:00:31.916 --> 00:00:33.440
hadn't.
So, he sent me this.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.197
This was never used,
but normally it would go into a

00:00:39.197 --> 00:00:45.520
machine and it would print out
stock prices at trades.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.886
I was giving a talk yesterday
at the New York Stock Exchange

00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:51.910
and I met him again and I said,
thank you for this;

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.478
my class was happy to see it.
He said, well I could have

00:00:55.478 --> 00:00:57.560
given you a whole ticker tape
machine.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.545
He said, well the attic at the
New York Stock Exchange was

00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:04.622
filled with them,
but they finally threw them

00:01:04.622 --> 00:01:09.704
out, so it's too late.
I think it is--this is evidence

00:01:09.704 --> 00:01:15.286
that information technology
really has dominated stock

00:01:15.286 --> 00:01:18.200
prices.
We didn't really have active

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.792
stock markets before the
electronic age,

00:01:20.792 --> 00:01:24.448
which is an interesting thing
to think about because the

00:01:24.448 --> 00:01:28.170
ticker tape machine was invented
by Edison in 1867.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.582
In 1867, there were hardly
any--there were stock markets,

00:01:32.582 --> 00:01:36.941
but they were very small.
It was really the electronic

00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:40.129
communications that made it what
it is.

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:45.212
It's exciting to think about
the future and where electronic

00:01:45.212 --> 00:01:49.950
communication is going to take
markets going forward.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.220
I wanted to continue today
about our futures markets.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.170
Let me just step back and
think, what is a futures market?

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.053
Today, I'm going to talk about
how it has expanded to cover

00:02:04.053 --> 00:02:07.670
lots of other things,
notably financial instruments.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.150
Let's just think,
what is a futures market?

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.083
If you read Holbrook Working,
who's on your reading list,

00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:21.165
and his half-century old paper,
back in those days that he was

00:02:21.165 --> 00:02:25.443
writing, he says that the name
"futures" is a bit misleading

00:02:25.443 --> 00:02:29.939
because that suggests that it's
talking about the future rather

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.270
than today.
If you listen to the news about

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.419
any commodity price,
it's always talking about

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:39.918
futures price.
They don't talk about the price

00:02:39.918 --> 00:02:42.120
today.
The futures price is the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.250
interesting--the point that
Working made is not so much that

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.800
it's in the future is that it's
well-defined and standardized.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.029
For agricultural futures,
it's true that the contract

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:59.550
doesn't mature for a month or
so,

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.031
but as Working points out,
any contract for delivery of

00:03:05.031 --> 00:03:09.322
something has some term.
They don't just deliver it

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:12.562
instantly and Working says,
there are times when the

00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:16.502
so-called spot price is actually
further in the future than the

00:03:16.502 --> 00:03:19.337
futures price.
If you look at the way things

00:03:19.337 --> 00:03:22.200
are traded--I'm going to be
talking a lot about oil,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.669
but let me just talk generally
about oil.

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.071
What is the price of oil and
how does anybody know what it

00:03:28.071 --> 00:03:31.128
is?
If you go to people who buy and

00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:36.379
sell oil, they will tell you,
well we don't just sell oil;

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.690
we don't just have it ready to
go.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.664
Almost all of the oil is sold
in long-term contracts,

00:03:43.664 --> 00:03:49.499
so an oil company will sell a
contract to deliver regularly to

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:51.699
some refinery,
oil.

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:55.302
They'll have these tankers
appear and we sign a five-year

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:58.840
contract--or whatever--and it
has all kinds of terms.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.456
If you read the contract it
would be fifty pages long and it

00:04:02.456 --> 00:04:06.380
would specify all kinds of "what
we'll do if we don't deliver" or

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.120
"what happens if we can't
deliver the grade we promised."

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.685
Lots of uncertainties are
defined, so who knows what the

00:04:13.685 --> 00:04:17.769
price of oil is when it's being
part of a long-term contract.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.589
That's why you need a futures
market and the futures market is

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:27.329
the market that's free of--it
has a standardized contract.

00:04:27.329 --> 00:04:32.215
We know exactly what the price
means and attention focuses on

00:04:32.215 --> 00:04:36.693
the futures market because the
trade there is--everybody

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:39.642
understands it;
everyone knows exactly what's

00:04:39.642 --> 00:04:41.904
being traded.
The minute-to-minute changes

00:04:41.904 --> 00:04:45.302
reflect something;
they reflect something real,

00:04:45.302 --> 00:04:50.031
namely change in the market not
any change in what's being

00:04:50.031 --> 00:04:53.683
delivered.
Anyway, it used to be that the

00:04:53.683 --> 00:04:57.544
only futures markets were for
commodities--for

00:04:57.544 --> 00:05:03.034
things--typically it was thought
that futures markets are good to

00:05:03.034 --> 00:05:08.181
have for things that are not
standardized--that are difficult

00:05:08.181 --> 00:05:11.268
to define.
So, we want rice futures and we

00:05:11.268 --> 00:05:14.525
want wheat futures because there
are so many different kinds of

00:05:14.525 --> 00:05:16.889
rice in different areas and
different--so,

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.220
we want to have a standardized
price.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.603
There were no financial futures
until the 1970s and people felt

00:05:27.603 --> 00:05:32.206
back then that we don't need
futures contracts because

00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:35.680
there's a standardization of
shares.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.310
Every share in a given company
is exactly identical.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.407
When you say,
I'd like to buy a hundred

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:44.002
shares of a company,
you're not going to ask the

00:05:44.002 --> 00:05:46.210
broker, well which shares did I
get?

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.797
And can I look at them?
Your broker would say in

00:05:49.797 --> 00:05:52.230
disbelief, look you've got
shares;

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.100
they're all absolutely
identical.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.091
You might think there's no need
for a futures market because the

00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:02.449
prices are already standardized
in the cash market.

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:05.921
Moreover, the prices that you
see traded on the stock exchange

00:06:05.921 --> 00:06:08.880
floor--you know exactly when the
trade took place;

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.040
they're not future-traded.
Why did we get futures markets?

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.835
Let me come back to that.
Let me just first--why did we

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:21.024
get stock futures markets?
Let me come back to that and

00:06:21.024 --> 00:06:24.449
talk about--let's be clear what
they are.

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:30.071
Stock index futures markets
came in around 1980 and one of

00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:35.693
the very first was the Standard
&amp; Poor 500 Stock Index

00:06:35.693 --> 00:06:41.709
Futures Market traded at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:47.577
It was a radical innovation
when it came in because people

00:06:47.577 --> 00:06:52.877
thought, what's the point?
I can see farmers delivering

00:06:52.877 --> 00:06:57.972
their corn or their oats or
whatever, but stocks--what's the

00:06:57.972 --> 00:07:00.307
point?
Well, it turned out to be

00:07:00.307 --> 00:07:03.795
absolutely right because--the
CME was absolutely right to

00:07:03.795 --> 00:07:06.910
create this market
because--within a few years,

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.783
there was more trade on the
futures market than there was on

00:07:10.783 --> 00:07:14.034
the stock market itself.
Let's be clear what they

00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:18.089
created--and this is the terms
of the contract as it is today.

00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:22.721
The S&amp;P 500 is an index of
stock prices produced by

00:07:22.721 --> 00:07:25.809
Standard &amp;
Poor's Corporation and

00:07:25.809 --> 00:07:30.527
it's--they take the prices of
500 stocks and they form a

00:07:30.527 --> 00:07:34.016
weighted average.
It's an arithmetic average

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:37.573
where the weights correspond to
the amounts outstanding of the

00:07:37.573 --> 00:07:40.490
various stocks,
so it's a value-weighted index.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:47.434
It's just a number published by
the American Stock Exchange--no,

00:07:47.434 --> 00:07:50.410
by Standard &amp;
Poor's.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:55.848
All it is at--just as with
agricultural futures--I don't

00:07:55.848 --> 00:08:00.200
know how clear I was about this
yesterday.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.543
If you--maybe I didn't say this.
Let me say that it applies to

00:08:04.543 --> 00:08:08.300
both agricultural futures and
financial futures.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.729
If you want to trade in the
futures market,

00:08:12.729 --> 00:08:19.161
you have to put up margin and
there's a margin requirement for

00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:22.914
each contract.
The margin is there to

00:08:22.914 --> 00:08:27.129
eliminate counterparty risk with
other contracts.

00:08:27.129 --> 00:08:31.822
When you sign a contract with
another person you have to worry

00:08:31.822 --> 00:08:34.899
whether that person will come
through,

00:08:34.899 --> 00:08:40.700
but with the exchange that
counterparty risk is eliminated.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.721
The way the exchange eliminates
it is it takes the other side

00:08:45.721 --> 00:08:50.324
itself--of every contract
who--it stands between you and

00:08:50.324 --> 00:08:55.679
the counterparty and it protects
itself by demanding margin.

00:08:55.679 --> 00:09:00.693
You have to,
up front, put up margin for any

00:09:00.693 --> 00:09:06.639
futures contract and the margin
is settled daily.

00:09:06.639 --> 00:09:12.283
Every day, they look at your
margin account and they adjust

00:09:12.283 --> 00:09:14.708
it.
So, if--let me go back to wheat

00:09:14.708 --> 00:09:18.271
futures because that's the
simpler--I don't think I really

00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:22.376
explained this well.
If you buy--when we say "buy

00:09:22.376 --> 00:09:25.899
wheat futures," what does that
mean?

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:30.349
That means--the word buy or
sell has a different meaning in

00:09:30.349 --> 00:09:33.642
futures markets.
When you buy wheat futures or,

00:09:33.642 --> 00:09:36.128
for that matter,
S&amp;P 500 in futures,

00:09:36.128 --> 00:09:38.360
it means that you put up
margin.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.210
You did not pay the price for
the contract;

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:46.350
you only paid margin,
which might be 5% or less than

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.222
the price.
If you're buying wheat futures,

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:54.124
what are you doing?
You're putting up margin and

00:09:54.124 --> 00:09:58.182
standing ready to see your
margin account credited or

00:09:58.182 --> 00:10:03.097
debited depending on the change
in the futures price from day to

00:10:03.097 --> 00:10:05.721
day.
If the price of wheat in the

00:10:05.721 --> 00:10:08.809
futures market goes up and you
bought futures,

00:10:08.809 --> 00:10:12.857
they will increase your margin
account by the amount that it

00:10:12.857 --> 00:10:15.838
went up.
If the price of wheat goes

00:10:15.838 --> 00:10:20.576
down, they will decrease your
margin account balance by that

00:10:20.576 --> 00:10:22.350
amount.
How do they get the money?

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:26.215
Well, that's because for every
buyer there's a seller in the

00:10:26.215 --> 00:10:29.360
futures market,
so somebody else sold futures.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.352
Both of you put up margin;
if you are buying,

00:10:32.352 --> 00:10:34.705
you put up margin;
if you are selling,

00:10:34.705 --> 00:10:38.150
you put up margin.
So, the result is that they

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:42.781
have a place to get the money.
If the price goes up and you

00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:45.870
bought, your margin account will
go up.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.338
The exchange will get the money
by taking it from the margin

00:10:49.338 --> 00:10:52.983
account of the guy who sold and
they've always fixed it so that

00:10:52.983 --> 00:10:56.570
the number of buyers always
equals the number of sellers.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.540
You see how the exchange can't
lose and you can't lose;

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:07.224
this is a guaranteed thing.
The only problem is that what

00:11:07.224 --> 00:11:13.227
if a margin account runs dry?
Both buyer and seller have put

00:11:13.227 --> 00:11:16.983
up margin and then the
price--let's say the price drops

00:11:16.983 --> 00:11:19.710
a lot;
the futures price drops a lot.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:28.606
Then, that means that the
buyer's margin account is wiped

00:11:28.606 --> 00:11:31.547
out.
What will happen then is that

00:11:31.547 --> 00:11:35.864
the futures commission merchant
will go to the person who bought

00:11:35.864 --> 00:11:41.035
the futures and say,
do you want to post more margin

00:11:41.035 --> 00:11:45.210
or do you want me to close you
out?

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:49.476
That person has a decision to
make and if he or she puts up

00:11:49.476 --> 00:11:53.301
more margin, then that
replenishes the margin account

00:11:53.301 --> 00:11:57.937
and the person can keep trading.
That's how the exchanges

00:11:57.937 --> 00:12:02.573
eliminate counterparty risk,
by daily resettlement of the

00:12:02.573 --> 00:12:05.126
contracts.
It's an invention--actually

00:12:05.126 --> 00:12:07.356
goes back to Japan;
although, it was slightly

00:12:07.356 --> 00:12:09.797
different in form.
It's an invention that

00:12:09.797 --> 00:12:13.812
eliminates any risk of the
counterparty not performing so

00:12:13.812 --> 00:12:17.820
that risk doesn't affect price.
So it's the same--are you clear

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.000
on that now--how the margin
account works?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.343
You might not enjoy this.
Depends on how much of a

00:12:23.343 --> 00:12:26.539
gambling instinct for how much
fun this is.

00:12:26.539 --> 00:12:30.744
If you buy or sell futures,
you can expect a phone call

00:12:30.744 --> 00:12:33.470
from your broker sooner or
later;

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:37.330
well, not necessarily,
unless you have incredibly good

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:38.851
luck.
Hillary Clinton,

00:12:38.851 --> 00:12:41.317
when she invested in the
futures market,

00:12:41.317 --> 00:12:45.019
she had incredibly good luck.
You know this story?

00:12:45.019 --> 00:12:47.525
When her husband,
Bill Clinton,

00:12:47.525 --> 00:12:51.032
was Governor,
she got a call from--a friend

00:12:51.032 --> 00:12:56.125
recommended to her a very good
broker who knew how to trade in

00:12:56.125 --> 00:13:00.706
commodity futures.
So, she put up something like

00:13:00.706 --> 00:13:06.302
$1,000 of her own money and then
the broker kept calling her and

00:13:06.302 --> 00:13:09.500
asking her what she wanted to
do.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:15.722
She just never lost anything;
she turned it into a $100,000

00:13:15.722 --> 00:13:19.710
within a year and then she
stopped.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.850
We don't know why--I'm not
anti-Hillary Clinton;

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.889
this is just a futures market
story.

00:13:24.889 --> 00:13:28.461
I like her a lot,
but what do you think happened

00:13:28.461 --> 00:13:30.506
there?
Her margin account just kept

00:13:30.506 --> 00:13:31.840
going up, and up,
and up.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.980
I mean, it went up amazingly.
You could conclude that she is

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.538
a brilliant trader and she ought
to be President of the United

00:13:39.538 --> 00:13:42.980
States, but then the next
question is, why did she stop?

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.680
Why did she run it for a
hundred-fold increase and stop?

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.376
Does anyone have any idea?
Is this common knowledge--this

00:13:50.376 --> 00:13:51.760
story?
Well, the story ends there;

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:57.057
nobody knows what happened.
Futures traders are willing to

00:13:57.057 --> 00:14:00.240
exercise a guess of what
happened.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.649
Does anyone have any guess what
you think happened?

00:14:04.649 --> 00:14:07.990
Well, I shouldn't say things so
political.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:11.653
I do like Hillary Clinton,
but what likely happened is

00:14:11.653 --> 00:14:15.731
some futures commission merchant
was thinking of bribing the

00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:19.281
Governor.
Maybe he didn't--never actually

00:14:19.281 --> 00:14:24.071
did it--but let's do a little
favor for his wife and then

00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:27.750
maybe I can ask him for
something later.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:31.873
So, the futures merchant just
didn't listen carefully to what

00:14:31.873 --> 00:14:33.942
she said.
He just--well,

00:14:33.942 --> 00:14:39.849
he sort of cooked the books and
gave her money by making it look

00:14:39.849 --> 00:14:42.771
like a trade.
When she found out--what

00:14:42.771 --> 00:14:45.081
finally likely happened is
someone said,

00:14:45.081 --> 00:14:48.279
do you think you're making so
much money in the futures

00:14:48.279 --> 00:14:50.828
market?
Remember who your husband is

00:14:50.828 --> 00:14:54.990
and this guy--do you trust him?
This is a likely guess.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.080
She finally wondered,
what is going on here?

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.990
And she stopped because she
didn't know what was happening

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:03.872
either.
Somehow money was coming in

00:15:03.872 --> 00:15:08.807
and--that's the very--now,
maybe she was just very savvy

00:15:08.807 --> 00:15:12.805
in her investing ability,
but usually your futures

00:15:12.805 --> 00:15:16.210
accounts go both up and down and
you get margin calls.

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:25.938
Anyway, the last day of the
contract there's a settlement

00:15:25.938 --> 00:15:30.141
and--in agricultural futures,
the last day there's delivery

00:15:30.141 --> 00:15:35.566
if you're still in the contract.
If you are a seller on the last

00:15:35.566 --> 00:15:40.564
day, you must deliver the
specified number of barrels or

00:15:40.564 --> 00:15:44.977
bushels of whatever it is.
Or, if you are a buyer,

00:15:44.977 --> 00:15:49.177
you must take delivery of them.
With stock futures it's

00:15:49.177 --> 00:15:54.059
different because nobody expects
you to deliver shares of stock.

00:15:54.059 --> 00:16:00.805
What happens on the last day is
there's a final settlement and

00:16:00.805 --> 00:16:07.108
that is in dollars in this
case--250 times the S&amp;P 500

00:16:07.108 --> 00:16:13.854
Index on the last day minus the
futures price of the preceding

00:16:13.854 --> 00:16:17.480
day;
that's the settlement.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.939
Of course, you have been
gaining the changes in the

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:23.500
futures prices every preceding
day.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:28.956
If you--this is what you
receive as a buyer if you bought

00:16:28.956 --> 00:16:34.023
the contract and this is what
you pay if you sold the

00:16:34.023 --> 00:16:37.245
contract.
Everyday between the time you

00:16:37.245 --> 00:16:40.278
originally bought,
you've been getting--if you

00:16:40.278 --> 00:16:44.526
were a buyer--the change in the
futures price and at the end you

00:16:44.526 --> 00:16:47.558
get this.
If you sum all those up--all

00:16:47.558 --> 00:16:51.883
the settlements you got since
you bought the contract until

00:16:51.883 --> 00:16:55.687
the expiration of the
contract--you would be getting

00:16:55.687 --> 00:17:00.610
the index at time T minus
the futures when you bought.

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.479
That defines it.
Everyday you get the change in

00:17:04.479 --> 00:17:07.756
the futures price;
those all add up into your

00:17:07.756 --> 00:17:11.819
margin account and on the last
day you get this.

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:13.170
What is it, really,
you're doing?

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:16.630
You could say--and they
wouldn't like to put this way at

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.970
the futures exchanges;
they don't like gambling

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:24.849
analogies, but I make gambling
analogies freely in this course.

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:29.170
It's like placing a bet on the
stock market.

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:32.040
If you think the stock market
is going to go up,

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.093
you buy the futures,
and if you think it's going to

00:17:35.093 --> 00:17:39.259
go down, you sell the futures.
If you buy one contract,

00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:42.727
how much money do you get?
You get, in total,

00:17:42.727 --> 00:17:46.018
over the total interval,
between the purchase date and

00:17:46.018 --> 00:17:50.333
the expiration of the contract,
you get the stock index minus

00:17:50.333 --> 00:17:53.980
the initial futures price you
paid, times $250;

00:17:53.980 --> 00:18:00.012
that's the gamble.
If you sell,

00:18:00.012 --> 00:18:08.981
it's just exactly the opposite.
Now, there's something called

00:18:08.981 --> 00:18:13.259
fair value and you'll see this
talked about a lot in futures.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:16.569
This is what the futures price
should be;

00:18:16.569 --> 00:18:20.160
we talked about it in terms of
wheat.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:25.024
Remember, the fair value of a
wheat futures was equal to the

00:18:25.024 --> 00:18:29.393
price of wheat today times one
plus the interest rate,

00:18:29.393 --> 00:18:33.417
plus the storage costs;
that was the formula we had

00:18:33.417 --> 00:18:36.279
last time.
That was the fair value because

00:18:36.279 --> 00:18:40.605
we concluded that somebody who's
storing grain has to make their

00:18:40.605 --> 00:18:42.965
expenses,
they have to make the interest

00:18:42.965 --> 00:18:45.319
cost and they have to make the
storage costs,

00:18:45.319 --> 00:18:49.819
so the futures price should be
equal to fair value.

00:18:49.819 --> 00:18:53.599
It's the same here with stock
index futures.

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:59.591
The fair value F of a
futures contract is equal to the

00:18:59.591 --> 00:19:05.183
stock price plus the stock price
times the interest rate,

00:19:05.183 --> 00:19:09.998
plus the storage cost.
The storage cost for stocks is

00:19:09.998 --> 00:19:14.730
negative because it doesn't cost
you anything to store a stock.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.759
Well, you don't even have to
store certificates anymore;

00:19:16.759 --> 00:19:19.390
your name will be held
electronically.

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:23.569
It's negative because you get
dividends.

00:19:23.569 --> 00:19:29.240
So, y is the dividend
yield that you get on the stock.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:33.670
So r minus y is
the adjustment you have to make.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:37.652
You see this--to get from stock
price to fair value--you see

00:19:37.652 --> 00:19:40.960
this is the same formula that we
had for wheat,

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.866
except that you understand that
storage costs for stocks are

00:19:45.866 --> 00:19:49.109
negative because they pay a
dividend.

00:19:49.109 --> 00:19:52.879
So, all I've done is I've--the
way I wrote it before was P x

00:19:52.879 --> 00:19:55.920
(1 + r + s) in the
preceding lecture;

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:01.503
now it's P x (1 + r
– y) because s =

00:20:01.503 --> 00:20:07.033
-y.
That's the fair value of a

00:20:07.033 --> 00:20:13.031
stock index futures.
Now, we said last time that

00:20:13.031 --> 00:20:17.989
sometimes prices deviate from
fair value--or maybe they don't

00:20:17.989 --> 00:20:21.460
depending on how you define fair
value.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:25.029
But, if you define fair value
as 1 + r + s, where

00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:27.819
s is just the cost of a
warehouse,

00:20:27.819 --> 00:20:31.954
then sometimes that formula
doesn't work because we talked

00:20:31.954 --> 00:20:35.052
about last time,
at the end of the growing

00:20:35.052 --> 00:20:37.920
season nobody is storing wheat
anymore.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:44.699
So, the wheat market falls into
backwardation and the futures

00:20:44.699 --> 00:20:49.639
price gets low.
Other than that--normally wheat

00:20:49.639 --> 00:20:53.924
is being stored,
so normally wheat prices are

00:20:53.924 --> 00:20:59.671
essentially equal to fair value,
but stocks are always being

00:20:59.671 --> 00:21:03.169
stored.
There's no--it would be unusual

00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:05.950
to see backwardation in this
market;

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:09.420
it would be abnormal because
we're always storing stocks.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.859
That's what we do with them is
we hold them.

00:21:11.859 --> 00:21:15.300
Dividend yield--you can have
backwardation,

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:20.052
however, if the dividend yield
is greater than the interest

00:21:20.052 --> 00:21:24.968
rate because then the adjustment
would make the futures price

00:21:24.968 --> 00:21:29.448
below the cash price.
Otherwise, you can't have

00:21:29.448 --> 00:21:34.619
backwardation in this market,
so price should always equal

00:21:34.619 --> 00:21:39.009
fair value.
Right now, we're in an unusual

00:21:39.009 --> 00:21:45.458
circumstance where the interest
rate and the dividend yield are

00:21:45.458 --> 00:21:49.363
about the same.
Right now, the Fed has cut

00:21:49.363 --> 00:21:53.116
short-term interest
rates--federal funds rate--to

00:21:53.116 --> 00:21:56.281
2.25%;
that's very close to the

00:21:56.281 --> 00:21:59.869
dividend yield on the S&amp;P
500.

00:21:59.869 --> 00:22:04.140
So, at this point of time,
the futures price is very close

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.737
to the spot price,
so fair value calculations are

00:22:07.737 --> 00:22:10.970
relatively unimportant.
Are there any questions?

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:14.672
Do you understand this?
I have a clipping from--I took

00:22:14.672 --> 00:22:18.421
it from yesterday's Wall
Street Journal and this is

00:22:18.421 --> 00:22:22.564
to prove that The Wall Street
Journal is still publishing

00:22:22.564 --> 00:22:26.049
financial data even though
they've cut way back.

00:22:26.049 --> 00:22:32.410
This used to be a longer entry,
but this is what they have as

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:35.934
of yesterday.
This says the Standard &amp;

00:22:35.934 --> 00:22:39.871
Poor 500--this is under futures
prices--Chicago Mercantile

00:22:39.871 --> 00:22:44.085
Exchange--and they're reminding
you that the settlement is 250

00:22:44.085 --> 00:22:47.470
times the index and they show
two contracts,

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:53.270
one expiring in June and one
expiring in December.

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:56.429
These are the prices;
this is the opening price at

00:22:56.429 --> 00:22:59.676
the beginning of the day;
this is the highest price for

00:22:59.676 --> 00:23:01.579
the day that the contracts
traded;

00:23:01.579 --> 00:23:05.000
this is the lowest price traded
for the day;

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.084
and this is the settled price,
which is essentially the last

00:23:09.084 --> 00:23:12.506
price of the day.
This is the change in the

00:23:12.506 --> 00:23:17.730
settled from the preceding day
and this is the open interest;

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:23.955
it's 550,000 contracts.
Do you understand what all this

00:23:23.955 --> 00:23:25.741
means?
Now, interesting,

00:23:25.741 --> 00:23:28.939
it looks like there's
backwardation because the

00:23:28.939 --> 00:23:33.039
December futures at open is
lower than the June futures,

00:23:33.039 --> 00:23:35.369
but I think this must be--it's
not much lower.

00:23:35.369 --> 00:23:40.089
I think it may have something
to do with timing of the trades.

00:23:40.089 --> 00:23:43.842
If you look at the settled
price over here they are almost

00:23:43.842 --> 00:23:46.870
exactly identical between June
and December.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:51.990
It's not backwardation;
it's contango--the futures is

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:56.210
above--it's going up as the
horizon goes out.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:07.859
That's where we are today and
they talk an awful lot about

00:24:07.859 --> 00:24:12.375
futures--stock index futures.
If you watch CNBC,

00:24:12.375 --> 00:24:18.596
they're always talking about it
and the reason is is that it's

00:24:18.596 --> 00:24:23.300
such a big and liquid market.
In fact, the futures

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.541
market--the S&amp;P futures
market--as I said,

00:24:26.541 --> 00:24:29.927
it's gotten bigger than the
stock market itself,

00:24:29.927 --> 00:24:34.402
at least at certain times.
It's also just a more

00:24:34.402 --> 00:24:40.917
trustworthy number and it moves
faster, so it's gotten a great

00:24:40.917 --> 00:24:46.290
deal of attention.
Why does the future market move

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:51.240
so fast and why is it such a
popular instrument?

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:57.487
I think the main reason is that
it is a market that--it's like a

00:24:57.487 --> 00:25:03.239
wholesale market for antiques
rather than the local antique

00:25:03.239 --> 00:25:06.076
dealer.
If you went to an antique

00:25:06.076 --> 00:25:09.987
dealer in New Haven to try to
buy some furniture for your

00:25:09.987 --> 00:25:13.339
apartment who knows what price
you would get;

00:25:13.339 --> 00:25:17.161
it would be very erratic and
you'd be dealing one-on-one with

00:25:17.161 --> 00:25:21.074
the dealer.
Well, that's what happens in

00:25:21.074 --> 00:25:25.700
the futures--in the stock market
as well.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.926
Remember, I was telling you
that a dealer has to have a

00:25:27.926 --> 00:25:30.969
bid-asked spread.
An antique dealer--they'll buy

00:25:30.969 --> 00:25:35.562
the chest of drawers at a lower
price then they'll sell it and

00:25:35.562 --> 00:25:40.156
the difference between bid and
asked is their bid-asked spread

00:25:40.156 --> 00:25:43.912
and that's their profit.
Dealers have to keep a wide

00:25:43.912 --> 00:25:47.407
bid-asked spread because they
have a lot of expenses and they

00:25:47.407 --> 00:25:50.960
have the risk of being ripped
off by more knowledgeable people

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.280
who really know antiques and
will buy their best stuff and

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:58.075
leave behind the junk.
Because they're constantly

00:25:58.075 --> 00:26:02.529
exposed to this risk antique
dealers keep wide bid-asked

00:26:02.529 --> 00:26:05.862
spreads.
It's the same with the stock

00:26:05.862 --> 00:26:08.787
market.
The people--the specialists or

00:26:08.787 --> 00:26:13.241
the dealers who trade on the
stock market with customers have

00:26:13.241 --> 00:26:16.765
the same concerns,
so they keep relatively wide

00:26:16.765 --> 00:26:19.888
bid-asked spreads.
In the futures market,

00:26:19.888 --> 00:26:23.910
there is--it's cleaner.
There's a huge volume of trade;

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:27.439
it's very competitive;
and there's less fear about

00:26:27.439 --> 00:26:30.926
being ripped off by someone who
has special knowledge because

00:26:30.926 --> 00:26:33.890
who knows what this index is
going to do anyway.

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:38.471
So, dealers have narrow
bid-asked spreads in the futures

00:26:38.471 --> 00:26:43.053
market and, as a result,
the futures market is where the

00:26:43.053 --> 00:26:46.000
action is.
The people who doubted that

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.825
back in 1980--who doubted that
financial futures would ever

00:26:49.825 --> 00:26:53.620
take off--were really wrong.
Even though stocks are

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:58.475
perfectly standardized--every
share is the same as every other

00:26:58.475 --> 00:27:01.500
share--we do need a futures
market,

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:08.490
so the futures market is very
important.

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:10.319
Anyway, I wanted to talk about
oil.

00:27:10.319 --> 00:27:13.410
Are there any questions about
oil--about stock futures?

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:18.260
I went through it kind of
quickly, but the important thing

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.920
to know is just to understand
fair value.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.589
It's actually a very simple
market to understand.

00:27:24.589 --> 00:27:28.836
Once you know this formula you
pretty much know the price for

00:27:28.836 --> 00:27:31.989
any future date.
Remember the r again,

00:27:31.989 --> 00:27:35.949
as in the preceding lecture,
is not the annual interest rate

00:27:35.949 --> 00:27:39.708
unless we're talking about a
contract that matures in one

00:27:39.708 --> 00:27:43.705
year.
It's the interest between now

00:27:43.705 --> 00:27:50.470
and the expiration date and the
same thing with dividends.

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:53.254
This is the dividend yield
where we're not talking about

00:27:53.254 --> 00:27:56.921
annual dividend yield,
but the dividends as a fraction

00:27:56.921 --> 00:28:01.269
of the price between now and
maturity of the contract.

00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:06.119
That's the only formula that we
really need.

00:28:06.119 --> 00:28:08.980
Let's think of the stock index
futures market;

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.563
it's where you really look to
see where the stock market is

00:28:12.563 --> 00:28:15.018
moving.
It's faster than the stock

00:28:15.018 --> 00:28:18.450
price index itself that the
S&amp;P publishes.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:23.026
The S&amp;P 500 is a little bit
behind the thing that it's

00:28:23.026 --> 00:28:25.170
trading on.
Why is that?

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:29.610
Well, that's because some of
the stocks in the S&amp;P 500

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:33.816
Index don't trade really
minute-by-minute with the same

00:28:33.816 --> 00:28:37.904
speed that you'd think,
so the S&amp;P 500 is always

00:28:37.904 --> 00:28:40.809
catching up on itself--the
actual index.

00:28:40.809 --> 00:28:44.033
This market has all the
smartest traders trading it and

00:28:44.033 --> 00:28:47.435
they kind of know when the
S&amp;P 500 is lagging and they

00:28:47.435 --> 00:28:50.299
immediately correct it in the
futures price.

00:28:50.299 --> 00:28:55.664
The futures price is the place
to look for what the stock

00:28:55.664 --> 00:28:59.922
market is really doing.
I'll move to oil futures,

00:28:59.922 --> 00:29:04.021
which is a matter of great
interest right now because of

00:29:04.021 --> 00:29:08.751
the turmoil in the oil market.
Oil futures actually go

00:29:08.751 --> 00:29:14.579
back--they're not so old either
compared to wheat or corn;

00:29:14.579 --> 00:29:16.220
they developed in the early
1980s.

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:34.091
This is the NYMEX oil futures
market and there are many

00:29:34.091 --> 00:29:38.792
futures markets for oil,
but the NYMEX is the most

00:29:38.792 --> 00:29:42.567
important one.
They are trading--this is

00:29:42.567 --> 00:29:46.991
different--it's a physical
delivery oil futures market,

00:29:46.991 --> 00:29:50.759
no different from the
agricultural futures.

00:29:50.759 --> 00:29:58.167
They define a particular grade
of oil and they call it light,

00:29:58.167 --> 00:30:02.897
sweet crude oil.
Sweet oil is better than sour

00:30:02.897 --> 00:30:06.423
oil.
I wouldn't try tasting it,

00:30:06.423 --> 00:30:11.540
but the refiners like it better
generally.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:15.504
So, it's a grade of oil;
it's also called West Texas

00:30:15.504 --> 00:30:19.570
Intermediate.
You have to--if you buy a

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:26.485
contract and you hold it to
maturity, you are going to have

00:30:26.485 --> 00:30:31.492
to take delivery of 1,000
barrels of light,

00:30:31.492 --> 00:30:36.500
sweet crude oil in Cushing,
Oklahoma.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.612
They pick Cushing,
Oklahoma as kind of central to

00:30:39.612 --> 00:30:43.281
the country.
You could call your broker and

00:30:43.281 --> 00:30:48.990
buy a contract today and then
you could get the May contract.

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:53.355
Then, in May you'd have to take
a trip down to Cushing and get

00:30:53.355 --> 00:30:57.720
your 1,000 barrels or you could
sell in the futures market and

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:02.086
that would mean that you would
have--you would be promising to

00:31:02.086 --> 00:31:05.475
deliver 1,000 barrels.
As I said last time,

00:31:05.475 --> 00:31:09.216
almost nobody who trades these
contracts actually takes

00:31:09.216 --> 00:31:13.096
delivery or makes delivery
because almost everyone closes

00:31:13.096 --> 00:31:15.590
out their contract before that.

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:27.539
It's the same idea as all the
other oil contracts.

00:31:27.539 --> 00:31:32.660
You have contracts maturing in
each month, there's one--we're

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:37.440
already--we've already passed
the expiration of the April

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.791
contract,
so it's May,

00:31:39.791 --> 00:31:44.859
June, July, August,
etc., and this is the price.

00:31:44.859 --> 00:31:49.272
These are--well actually,
they make a distinction between

00:31:49.272 --> 00:31:52.483
last and settled.
The settled price is the

00:31:52.483 --> 00:31:56.624
important price because that
determines the changes in your

00:31:56.624 --> 00:32:01.765
margin account.
The settled price as of

00:32:01.765 --> 00:32:12.160
yesterday reached $113.44 per
barrel, which is a record high.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:19.027
You can see that as delivery
dates go out the settled price

00:32:19.027 --> 00:32:26.250
goes down, so the oil market is
currently in backwardation.

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:30.557
Now, remember what we said
about futures is that normally

00:32:30.557 --> 00:32:34.355
they're in contango.
Remember, the futures price

00:32:34.355 --> 00:32:38.412
fair value tends to equal the
price today, times one,

00:32:38.412 --> 00:32:42.000
plus the interest rate,
plus storage costs.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.859
Storage costs for oil are
substantial;

00:32:44.859 --> 00:32:47.569
this is a thick,
bulky commodity.

00:32:47.569 --> 00:32:49.619
You've got to have one of those
storage tanks;

00:32:49.619 --> 00:32:51.810
you see them out there in New
Haven Harbor.

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:55.747
They cost money;
it's expensive to store,

00:32:55.747 --> 00:32:59.250
so storage costs are not
negligible for oil;

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:01.250
plus, interest rates are
positive.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:06.549
We would think that oil should
have contango normally.

00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:10.712
Its price should be going up,
but very frequently oil is not

00:33:10.712 --> 00:33:14.200
in contango;
right now it is not.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:19.825
You can see that oil prices are
lower by October,

00:33:19.825 --> 00:33:23.809
according to the futures
market.

00:33:23.809 --> 00:33:31.034
I wanted to reflect a little
bit on what oil--what is going

00:33:31.034 --> 00:33:35.229
on in the oil market.
The thing you have to

00:33:35.229 --> 00:33:38.900
understand in terms of what--you
understand the contract;

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.039
it's exactly the same as a
wheat contract.

00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:45.307
It's just a contract to deliver
1,000 barrels or receive it and

00:33:45.307 --> 00:33:49.300
if you do that you don't have to
come up with oil today.

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.004
You probably never come up oil;
you just have to come up with

00:33:52.004 --> 00:33:55.269
margin today and your margin
account will reflect the change

00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:58.048
in oil prices.
This is the number you see in

00:33:58.048 --> 00:34:00.391
the newspaper.
This is when they talk about

00:34:00.391 --> 00:34:02.130
the price of oil in the
newspaper;

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:06.986
this is it.
There's also something called

00:34:06.986 --> 00:34:11.798
Platts, which is a company
that--I guess it's a McGraw-Hill

00:34:11.798 --> 00:34:15.199
Company--that does cash prices
of oil.

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:19.564
It's not quoted as much because
I don't think it's as reliable

00:34:19.564 --> 00:34:24.030
as this.
The problem with--you might

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:29.030
say, this is a month in the
future.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:33.485
Isn't that--that's not today's
price, but that's what people

00:34:33.485 --> 00:34:37.864
are quoting as today's price
because it's the most accurate

00:34:37.864 --> 00:34:41.420
price.
Now, why is it going into

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:45.374
backwardation?
I wanted to think about storage

00:34:45.374 --> 00:34:49.335
of oil because we were saying
that everything should be

00:34:49.335 --> 00:34:52.630
generally in contango.
Aren't they storing oil?

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.928
As I said, if you drive out to
New Haven Harbor you see all

00:34:55.928 --> 00:35:00.170
these storage tanks.
Don't they have oil in them?

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:03.480
I wanted to think a little bit
about where the oil is.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:08.513
Most of the oil is still in the
ground in the Persian Gulf,

00:35:08.513 --> 00:35:12.153
in Mexico, in Russia,
and all sorts of places,

00:35:12.153 --> 00:35:16.126
but we don't count that as
storage of oil because it has to

00:35:16.126 --> 00:35:20.510
be extracted and it's not just
there for sale--there's a lag.

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:24.612
So, we have to consider oil
that's above ground and ready to

00:35:24.612 --> 00:35:27.170
go.
It is stored and it's stored

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:30.602
here in New Haven.
In fact, the Government of the

00:35:30.602 --> 00:35:34.596
United Stated has created what
they call a "strategic petroleum

00:35:34.596 --> 00:35:37.056
reserve."
It has taken oil and it's

00:35:37.056 --> 00:35:40.495
storing it in caverns,
in caves, and this is in case

00:35:40.495 --> 00:35:44.610
of a national emergency where we
suddenly really need oil.

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:49.104
That isn't going to affect this
market because it's being held

00:35:49.104 --> 00:35:53.230
by the Government for some war
or some terrible event.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:56.520
It's not on the market,
so that doesn't affect

00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:00.981
the--even though the market is
in backwardation the Government

00:36:00.981 --> 00:36:03.760
is not going to sell off this
oil,

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.989
so it's not affecting the
market.

00:36:05.989 --> 00:36:09.772
The other thing that's happened
is there's a heating oil

00:36:09.772 --> 00:36:14.493
reserve;
this was created by President

00:36:14.493 --> 00:36:19.550
Clinton in the year 2000.
That is actually in two places;

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:24.060
it's in New York and New Haven.
So, we are the storage place

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.823
for heating oil.
This is not a strategic

00:36:26.823 --> 00:36:29.404
petroleum reserve,
but it's the reserve that the

00:36:29.404 --> 00:36:32.590
Government can use to stabilize
the heating oil market.

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:36.987
They were concerned about
spikes in heating oil affecting

00:36:36.987 --> 00:36:41.150
people who are in difficult
economic circumstances.

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:45.201
That reserve could ultimately
affect the market if the

00:36:45.201 --> 00:36:49.481
government chooses to sell it
off, but they only have two

00:36:49.481 --> 00:36:52.309
million barrels,
so it's not big.

00:36:52.309 --> 00:36:56.393
I think the first thing to
recognize about the oil market

00:36:56.393 --> 00:37:01.059
is that there isn't much storage
compared to the flow through.

00:37:01.059 --> 00:37:05.889
Basically, what we have in oil
is we have those wells all over

00:37:05.889 --> 00:37:09.619
the world pumping oil.
They put it into tankers;

00:37:09.619 --> 00:37:13.708
the tankers take it across the
ocean to various countries where

00:37:13.708 --> 00:37:17.730
it goes into temporary storage
at harbors, but it doesn't stay

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:20.613
there long.
It keeps flowing through,

00:37:20.613 --> 00:37:25.158
then it's put on oil trucks and
it's driven to refineries and

00:37:25.158 --> 00:37:31.421
then it ends up in gas stations.
So, there's not a lot of oil in

00:37:31.421 --> 00:37:34.721
storage.
That's why the oil market is

00:37:34.721 --> 00:37:38.902
very often in backwardation,
because the price of oil

00:37:38.902 --> 00:37:42.440
reflects the temporary
scarcities of oil.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.998
If there's any shortage of oil,
if something happens,

00:37:45.998 --> 00:37:50.104
then the oil price can jump up
and everybody knows it's going

00:37:50.104 --> 00:37:55.070
to come back down;
so, you can have backwardation.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:58.904
Basically, you don't have
people selling off their stores

00:37:58.904 --> 00:38:03.150
when there's a backwardation
like we talked about last time.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:07.100
It's not like at the end of the
harvest people know--when the

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:10.490
wheat harvest is coming in,
people know that wheat prices

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:12.890
should go down and they sell off
their stores;

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:17.452
it's not like that here.
The stores that we have of oil

00:38:17.452 --> 00:38:21.945
are--have a convenience yield,
so it's something that

00:38:21.945 --> 00:38:26.869
doesn't--backwardation doesn't
quickly correct itself.

00:38:26.869 --> 00:38:30.375
I think that what this means
here--this backwardation in the

00:38:30.375 --> 00:38:33.940
oil market--is that people think
that oils have spiked up,

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:37.659
there's a temporary shortage,
and that prices are going to

00:38:37.659 --> 00:38:43.829
come down somewhat,
although not a whole lot here.

00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:48.920
This is a futures term
structure;

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.880
I have it plotted for a number
of years.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.680
I should have made this a
little bigger;

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:58.300
it's a little hard to read.
This is today.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:04.070
What this is for--all of these
are from today's news on this

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:09.736
top line and what it shows is,
for every maturity out to six

00:39:09.736 --> 00:39:12.710
years, what the futures price
is.

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:17.720
Right now, we're at $114 a
barrel, but the market is

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:22.570
predicting a decline.
Not a huge decline,

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:30.070
but back to something like $108
a barrel in six years.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:35.806
You can see that the futures
market has often been predicting

00:39:35.806 --> 00:39:40.471
either increases or declines.
You can look at different times

00:39:40.471 --> 00:39:46.383
in history;
particularly of interest here I

00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:55.195
have Hurricane Katrina and I
can't--this is Hurricane

00:39:55.195 --> 00:39:59.856
Katrina.
Right after the hurricane,

00:39:59.856 --> 00:40:05.126
in August of 2005,
the hurricane destroyed some of

00:40:05.126 --> 00:40:12.010
our refining capability and some
of our storage tanks because New

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:18.571
Orleans is an oil center where
tankers come and they go up the

00:40:18.571 --> 00:40:22.924
Mississippi River.
We destroyed--the hurricane

00:40:22.924 --> 00:40:25.144
destroyed part of our
infrastructure,

00:40:25.144 --> 00:40:28.966
so everybody in the market knew
that that means that oil prices

00:40:28.966 --> 00:40:31.975
are temporarily high;
so, you can see the

00:40:31.975 --> 00:40:36.617
backwardation in the market.
We see even more backwardation

00:40:36.617 --> 00:40:39.233
today;
that's an indication that

00:40:39.233 --> 00:40:43.870
there's something going on in
the short run in our market,

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:48.519
if you believe the market.
What do I have?

00:40:48.519 --> 00:40:53.510
I have here--this goes way
back--this one is 1990.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:55.909
You notice it stops after
eighteen months;

00:40:55.909 --> 00:40:58.603
that's because in 1990 the
futures market wasn't as

00:40:58.603 --> 00:41:01.290
developed as it is now;
it only went out eighteen

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:03.875
months.
You can see there was strong

00:41:03.875 --> 00:41:07.201
backwardation.
This was when Saddam Hussein

00:41:07.201 --> 00:41:11.698
invaded Kuwait and it caused a
tremendous disruption of oil

00:41:11.698 --> 00:41:15.420
supply and everybody knew that
was temporary,

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:18.400
so the futures prices were
lower.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:22.502
That was about the most
backward-dated futures market

00:41:22.502 --> 00:41:25.409
we've seen in oil.
Today it's pretty

00:41:25.409 --> 00:41:28.380
backward-dated,
but not so dramatically

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.820
percentage-wise,
as it was after Katrina.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:36.420
This is a plot of oil prices in
the United States.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:41.090
This is West Texas Intermediate.
Well actually,

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:44.085
I'm not sure it's all the way
back--is West Texas--no,

00:41:44.085 --> 00:41:47.192
it's not all the way because
Texas Oil wasn't discovered

00:41:47.192 --> 00:41:49.000
until around 1900,
I think;

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.300
I'm not sure about that date
exactly.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.810
This is Pennsylvania Oil back
here;

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:58.056
I've got it going way back.
The interesting thing about

00:41:58.056 --> 00:42:02.739
this--this is of interest at the
moment--that oil prices now are

00:42:02.739 --> 00:42:07.570
higher than they've ever been
and this is in real terms--real,

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:13.093
inflation-corrected terms.
Very interesting what this

00:42:13.093 --> 00:42:20.041
means for our lives;
just ten years ago oil was at a

00:42:20.041 --> 00:42:24.909
record low.
We were at a little over $10 a

00:42:24.909 --> 00:42:27.610
barrel.
So, what is going on here?

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:33.167
We've seen the oil price jump
up something close to ten-fold

00:42:33.167 --> 00:42:38.330
in ten years;
it's a huge surprise.

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:45.266
There are other surprises.
One thing I wanted to do was to

00:42:45.266 --> 00:42:54.907
go through just a few--go
through a few stories about oil

00:42:54.907 --> 00:42:59.782
prices here.
This was a period when oil was

00:42:59.782 --> 00:43:03.192
generally very stable.
In the post World War II

00:43:03.192 --> 00:43:06.840
period, there was a Texas
Railroad Commission that was

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.407
stabilizing oil prices.
At that time,

00:43:09.407 --> 00:43:11.800
the U.S.
was not a big importer of oil;

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:17.080
we had our own oil supply and
we tended to--we had sort of a

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:22.630
monopoly that tried to stabilize
the price and they were pretty

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:26.300
successful for this long time
period.

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:32.093
The huge shock came--and this
is called the first oil

00:43:32.093 --> 00:43:38.179
shock--and that was in 1973-74.
Oil went up;

00:43:38.179 --> 00:43:42.889
it more than doubled--almost
three times increase in oil

00:43:42.889 --> 00:43:47.570
prices all of a sudden.
That was associated with a

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:52.552
particular--it's called the
first oil crisis--and it

00:43:52.552 --> 00:43:58.414
coincides with the Yom Kippur
War between Israel and her Arab

00:43:58.414 --> 00:44:02.100
neighbors.
It caused a--Israel quickly

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:05.883
triumphed in that war,
but it left a lot of bad

00:44:05.883 --> 00:44:10.241
feelings among the surrounding
Arab countries who were

00:44:10.241 --> 00:44:13.860
sympathetic with the Palestinian
cause,

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:18.090
so they cut back on their oil
production.

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:28.032
We have an organization called
OPEC--that's the Organization of

00:44:28.032 --> 00:44:34.447
Petroleum Exporting
Countries--and it was

00:44:34.447 --> 00:44:44.389
established in 1960 with a small
number of Arab countries,

00:44:44.389 --> 00:44:53.233
but it has gradually grown and
has more and more countries that

00:44:53.233 --> 00:44:57.528
are members.
It was OPEC that constrained

00:44:57.528 --> 00:45:01.139
the supply of oil for the first
oil crisis.

00:45:01.139 --> 00:45:08.690
This is the second oil crisis
here and that was in 1979-80.

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:12.516
This again had its origin--at
least the common story and there

00:45:12.516 --> 00:45:17.675
must be some truth to the story.
It had its origin in another

00:45:17.675 --> 00:45:23.943
crisis in the Middle East and
that was the war between Iraq

00:45:23.943 --> 00:45:27.731
and Iran.
There was an Iranian revolution

00:45:27.731 --> 00:45:32.795
in 1979, where the Shah of Iran
was thrown out and the Ayatollah

00:45:32.795 --> 00:45:37.779
Khomeini came in and Iraq used
this as an opportunity to try to

00:45:37.779 --> 00:45:43.511
grab some oil from Iran.
This war completely disrupted

00:45:43.511 --> 00:45:50.550
oil supplies and we had this
huge spike in oil prices then.

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:53.340
A lot of these spikes seem to
have political causes;

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:59.969
this spike in the oil price is
caused by the 1991 invasion of

00:45:59.969 --> 00:46:06.929
the--well, the United States was
the primary invader of Iraq.

00:46:06.929 --> 00:46:13.512
This was after September 11th
and this disrupted oil supplies

00:46:13.512 --> 00:46:16.570
again.
All these times were periods of

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:20.580
backwardation in the oil market
because people saw them as

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:24.449
crises that were limiting the
supply of oil for now,

00:46:24.449 --> 00:46:30.660
but would eventually correct
themselves.

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:36.949
What's happening now?
This is just an amazing spike

00:46:36.949 --> 00:46:40.587
of oil right now.
There isn't--we have this war

00:46:40.587 --> 00:46:45.364
in Iraq, but it's not a sudden,
intense thing that--it's not

00:46:45.364 --> 00:46:50.739
disrupting oil supplies.
So, why are we seeing this huge

00:46:50.739 --> 00:46:54.309
spike in oil?
That is an interesting question.

00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:58.675
Part of it has to do with the
fact that we have a rapidly

00:46:58.675 --> 00:47:03.041
growing world economy and
developing countries are moving

00:47:03.041 --> 00:47:06.159
forward faster than was
anticipated.

00:47:06.159 --> 00:47:10.485
So, there's a lot of demand for
oil from India,

00:47:10.485 --> 00:47:15.000
China, and other rapidly
developing countries.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.674
They say that China builds a
new city the size of Houston,

00:47:20.674 --> 00:47:25.353
Texas every month,
so they're consuming an awful

00:47:25.353 --> 00:47:30.211
lot of energy to do this.
The other side of it is that

00:47:30.211 --> 00:47:33.309
discoveries of oil have been
disappointing.

00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:37.354
I was just down in Mexico and
the President Calderon is

00:47:37.354 --> 00:47:41.923
talking about privatizing the
Mexican oil--or at least part of

00:47:41.923 --> 00:47:46.491
it--oil industry because they
have been disappointing in their

00:47:46.491 --> 00:47:49.795
exploration.
They're not finding oil,

00:47:49.795 --> 00:47:55.090
so the reserves that Mexico has
been actually declining rapidly.

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:59.960
This brings up another thing
about the ownership of oil.

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:05.280
I just wanted to mention
nationalization.

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:10.389
It used to be that most of the
oil in the world was owned by

00:48:10.389 --> 00:48:13.420
private companies or
individuals,

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:18.186
but nationalization began in
1938 in Mexico,

00:48:18.186 --> 00:48:25.169
where a left-leaning government
decided that all the Mexican oil

00:48:25.169 --> 00:48:31.598
that was owned by foreigners
really belonged to the Mexican

00:48:31.598 --> 00:48:35.985
people.
So, the Mexican government just

00:48:35.985 --> 00:48:40.614
said, it's ours.
That was an outrageous thing to

00:48:40.614 --> 00:48:46.449
say then, but it was greeted by
shock by international law.

00:48:46.449 --> 00:48:50.380
They just took the oil in their
country, saying that it wasn't

00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:56.554
fair the way it was sold.
It was followed up in 1951 by

00:48:56.554 --> 00:49:03.130
Iran and other countries
followed as well.

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:07.204
Now we're seeing a reverse.
Mexico nationalized its oil in

00:49:07.204 --> 00:49:11.688
1938, but now that the supply is
dwindling, President Calderon

00:49:11.688 --> 00:49:17.219
wants to reverse the process;
this is controversial now.

00:49:17.219 --> 00:49:21.087
In yesterday's newspaper--I
don't know if you read The

00:49:21.087 --> 00:49:25.438
Wall Street Journal--it had
a story saying that Russian--for

00:49:25.438 --> 00:49:29.140
the first quarter of 2008,
Russian production of oil

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:31.880
declined for the first time in
ten years.

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:36.199
There's worry now that Russia
is running out of oil.

00:49:36.199 --> 00:49:40.889
I think it's these--this impact
of--news like this is having a

00:49:40.889 --> 00:49:45.579
psychological effect on the
market and it's causing a huge,

00:49:45.579 --> 00:49:50.181
well, you might consider this a
bubble in oil prices,

00:49:50.181 --> 00:49:53.810
but I'm not so sure that it's a
bubble.

00:49:53.810 --> 00:49:59.733
It's certainly unprecedented.
It seems like we're entering a

00:49:59.733 --> 00:50:01.369
period of great market
volatility.

00:50:01.369 --> 00:50:06.786
We've seen an unprecedented
bubble in home prices and now

00:50:06.786 --> 00:50:12.300
the economy is reeling from the
effects of this bubble.

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:15.190
Look what's happening,
as well, in oil prices.

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:17.450
Once again, there's no war
right now;

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:22.230
there's nothing really dramatic.
We do have--you could call it a

00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:27.329
war, but it's not something that
has shut down the Persian Gulf

00:50:27.329 --> 00:50:33.170
and closed off oil supplies.
So, it seems like it's

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:40.019
something more systemic.
It's something more to do with

00:50:40.019 --> 00:50:45.305
the economic situation than
before or it's something

00:50:45.305 --> 00:50:48.157
speculative.
We have--so we have

00:50:48.157 --> 00:50:50.958
backwardation,
but it's not a whole lot of

00:50:50.958 --> 00:50:55.361
backwardation.
They're still predicting oil

00:50:55.361 --> 00:51:02.424
prices to come down to something
like there--well over $100 in

00:51:02.424 --> 00:51:09.718
eight years--so it's not a--it's
not something that's related to

00:51:09.718 --> 00:51:15.969
a particular crisis that is
going to end quickly.

00:51:15.969 --> 00:51:22.082
I wanted to go--this just is a
clipping I got from--this was

00:51:22.082 --> 00:51:27.780
the day that Saddam Hussein
announced an oil embargo.

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:36.690
This was his reaction to the
United States' pressure on him

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:43.603
and so oil prices spiked up.
It seemed dramatic when I made

00:51:43.603 --> 00:51:47.059
this clipping,
but now oil is $100 a barrel;

00:51:47.059 --> 00:51:51.078
that's only six years ago,
but at that time people

00:51:51.078 --> 00:51:56.327
thought--the market thought that
oil prices were coming back down

00:51:56.327 --> 00:51:58.530
by '03.
They were really wrong;

00:51:58.530 --> 00:52:01.450
people didn't get it.
All this time,

00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:05.386
people thought that oil--a
large part of the time it was in

00:52:05.386 --> 00:52:08.172
backwardation.
They thought there was some

00:52:08.172 --> 00:52:12.041
special event occurring--this is
Saddam Hussein--but it turns out

00:52:12.041 --> 00:52:14.579
that there was something driving
it up.

00:52:14.579 --> 00:52:17.800
This is again--this is natural
gas on that same date.

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:21.142
This is still in contango
because the prices are going up

00:52:21.142 --> 00:52:23.529
through time,
so that kind of explains if

00:52:23.529 --> 00:52:27.050
Saddam Hussein was selectively
hitting on the oil market and

00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:30.800
not the natural gas market;
that explains those two markets.

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.949
I wanted to talk briefly about
other futures.

00:52:32.949 --> 00:52:37.725
There's a gold futures market
and the gold futures

00:52:37.725 --> 00:52:43.767
market--this is an old clipping
I had of a very steady contango

00:52:43.767 --> 00:52:46.534
market.
That's because gold is very

00:52:46.534 --> 00:52:50.280
different than oil.
Gold is in storage.

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.190
There's nothing to do with gold
except hold it.

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:54.789
You don't burn it.
That's the difference;

00:52:54.789 --> 00:52:58.335
oil you burn it and it's gone,
so we don't have much around

00:52:58.335 --> 00:53:01.880
and we're always vulnerable to
some supply interruption.

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:04.080
But with gold,
there's no supply interruption;

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:07.002
we don't burn gold;
it just sits there and we're

00:53:07.002 --> 00:53:10.742
holding this stuff.
We don't know what to do with

00:53:10.742 --> 00:53:13.238
that.
It can't really be in contango

00:53:13.238 --> 00:53:17.128
for very long because someone
who's holding gold is going to

00:53:17.128 --> 00:53:19.137
say,
hey if it's going down in the

00:53:19.137 --> 00:53:21.860
futures market I'm not going to
sit on this stuff;

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:27.730
I'm going to sell it.
It stays in--did I say contango?

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:30.739
If it's in backwardation people
would sell it.

00:53:30.739 --> 00:53:34.310
It stays very nicely in
contango and it's going up at

00:53:34.310 --> 00:53:37.700
the rate of interest.
The storage--there's a storage

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:40.234
cost as well,
but I don't know how big that

00:53:40.234 --> 00:53:43.176
is for gold.
I guess you'd have to pay for a

00:53:43.176 --> 00:53:46.789
police force to defend your
gold--something like that.

00:53:46.789 --> 00:53:52.648
So, it must have some storage
costs, but it's a very simple

00:53:52.648 --> 00:53:57.800
market because it stays in
contango all the time.

00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:02.449
Copper futures--now copper is
different from gold because it's

00:54:02.449 --> 00:54:05.269
not--this is a 2004 clipping
again.

00:54:05.269 --> 00:54:09.456
Copper is an industrial
commodity that gets used up,

00:54:09.456 --> 00:54:13.806
so it suffers from supply
disruptions and it can--like

00:54:13.806 --> 00:54:17.090
oil--it can fall into
backwardation.

00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:23.239
Here, I should write these--did
I ever write these down?

00:54:23.239 --> 00:54:28.133
Contango, just to make sure,
is when futures prices are

00:54:28.133 --> 00:54:31.940
going up as the maturity--with
maturity;

00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:34.920
higher prices for more future
dates.

00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:43.599
Backwardation is when it's
going down.

00:54:43.599 --> 00:54:49.130
This is an example of a
backwardated market.

00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:53.070
The prices as we go out to
further and further--this is

00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:56.354
2004--when we go out to December
of that year,

00:54:56.354 --> 00:55:02.583
it's down from $139 to $136.
When we go out to December of

00:55:02.583 --> 00:55:07.820
the following year,
it's down to $118.

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:10.780
Gold, by the way,
has gone up a lot too.

00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:13.423
There's been a lot of commodity
price increases that surprised

00:55:13.423 --> 00:55:15.240
us.
This is the federal funds

00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:19.534
futures--another clipping.
There's a futures market for

00:55:19.534 --> 00:55:25.120
the federal funds rate and it's
cash-settled because you can't

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:30.568
deliver federal funds.
The settlement--the price shown

00:55:30.568 --> 00:55:34.440
is $100 minus the federal funds
rate.

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:42.730
So back then--this is 2004--the
federal funds rate was about 5%.

00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:52.780
So, this looks like 5.25%,
so $100 minus $94.74 is 5.25%;

00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:58.029
that's what the federal funds
rate was expected to be in March

00:55:58.029 --> 00:56:01.886
of 2004.
Here you see that the federal

00:56:01.886 --> 00:56:07.363
funds rate was expected to
continue to decline at that

00:56:07.363 --> 00:56:09.859
time.
This market can go either way

00:56:09.859 --> 00:56:13.428
because you don't store federal
funds, so there's no fair value

00:56:13.428 --> 00:56:16.480
calculation like there are with
the other markets.

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:21.929
It reflects the expectations of
future interest rates.

00:56:21.929 --> 00:56:24.967
Right now, I don't--I should
have gotten today's,

00:56:24.967 --> 00:56:28.574
but I think the federal funds
futures market is predicting

00:56:28.574 --> 00:56:32.738
right now,
with the federal funds rate at

00:56:32.738 --> 00:56:38.750
2.25%, the federal funds
market--this would be $97.75,

00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:41.116
or $100 minus 2.25%;
or it would be close to that

00:56:41.116 --> 00:56:43.039
and it would be going down with
time.

00:56:43.039 --> 00:56:47.821
People are expecting the Fed to
cut interest rates--I'm sorry,

00:56:47.821 --> 00:56:51.897
these numbers would be going
up, but I don't have the

00:56:51.897 --> 00:56:56.422
clipping for today.
I just finally wanted to talk

00:56:56.422 --> 00:57:01.305
about home price futures,
which is a market that I've

00:57:01.305 --> 00:57:07.690
gotten involved with creating at
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:10.309
I got involved with them
because I have a price index.

00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:14.644
My colleague and I,
Karl Case, who's a professor at

00:57:14.644 --> 00:57:18.632
Wellesley College--he and I,
in the late 1980s,

00:57:18.632 --> 00:57:23.110
created a home price index.
This was our research;

00:57:23.110 --> 00:57:29.805
we put it out as a working
paper here at Yale twenty years

00:57:29.805 --> 00:57:31.760
ago.
From the beginning,

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:35.115
we thought that the real
importance of having a home

00:57:35.115 --> 00:57:40.420
price index is for trading.
We live in a world where people

00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:46.005
don't trade--there's no
international market for real

00:57:46.005 --> 00:57:49.857
estate.
It's quite remarkable that

00:57:49.857 --> 00:57:55.840
there is not because real estate
is a huge asset class.

00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:01.619
The value of single-family
homes in this country is about

00:58:01.619 --> 00:58:07.502
30% bigger than the value of the
stock market in the U.S.;

00:58:07.502 --> 00:58:12.869
yet, we see so much talk about
the stock market.

00:58:12.869 --> 00:58:17.431
When we started in 1988 we
realized not only was there no

00:58:17.431 --> 00:58:22.467
market for single family homes,
except the very local market,

00:58:22.467 --> 00:58:26.920
there was also no price index
for single family homes.

00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:32.050
It's just sometimes amazing how
undeveloped things are.

00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:35.344
Here we are in the twentieth
century, everything is

00:58:35.344 --> 00:58:39.401
computerized and all that,
but you just want to know what

00:58:39.401 --> 00:58:43.750
home prices have been doing in
the United States in the late

00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:48.420
1980s and you couldn't find out.
There were some indexes,

00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:52.774
but they were rather poor,
we thought, and not very

00:58:52.774 --> 00:58:57.213
reliable.
We did our econometric work and

00:58:57.213 --> 00:59:04.110
devised a method of repeat sales
method of home price indexes.

00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:09.358
I wrote a book in 1993 called
Macro Markets about--it

00:59:09.358 --> 00:59:13.539
talked a lot about index number
construction.

00:59:13.539 --> 00:59:17.422
I said in the book that we need
to devise a home price index

00:59:17.422 --> 00:59:21.700
that is as close as possible to
something like the S&amp;P 500,

00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:26.034
which is a stock price index.
The problem with home prices is

00:59:26.034 --> 00:59:29.440
we have a much bigger
non-trading problem.

00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:33.988
The S&amp;P 500 is not very
out-of-date because stocks

00:59:33.988 --> 00:59:39.224
usually don't go untraded for
more than a few minutes or maybe

00:59:39.224 --> 00:59:43.447
a few hours at times.
With homes, the typical home

00:59:43.447 --> 00:59:47.823
doesn't trade every ten years,
so we have a huge non-trading

00:59:47.823 --> 00:59:50.773
problem.
What we did is we created an

00:59:50.773 --> 00:59:55.117
index that was as close as
possible to a stock price index

00:59:55.117 --> 00:59:59.079
so that it could be traded on a
financial market.

00:59:59.079 --> 01:00:01.676
Then I had a student here,
Allan Weiss,

01:00:01.676 --> 01:00:05.434
who said, why don't we get
going and get--my student was

01:00:05.434 --> 01:00:08.926
graduating;
he was an SOM student--MBA

01:00:08.926 --> 01:00:12.021
student.
He was graduating and he

01:00:12.021 --> 01:00:17.439
thought we should produce these
indexes for sale for use in

01:00:17.439 --> 01:00:21.550
financial markets,
so he wanted to do it.

01:00:21.550 --> 01:00:24.408
He set up our company,
Case Shiller Weiss,

01:00:24.408 --> 01:00:26.500
Incorporated,
and he ran it.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.049
Now, Case and I were just on
the advisory--well,

01:00:29.049 --> 01:00:31.761
we were on the board of
directors, but we were just

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:34.329
advising the operations.
I was so proud of him;

01:00:34.329 --> 01:00:38.933
my student created the
Case-Shiller Home Price Indexes

01:00:38.933 --> 01:00:43.375
and we started publishing them.
Then in early 1990s,

01:00:43.375 --> 01:00:48.178
we traveled to all the futures
markets, proposing to them that

01:00:48.178 --> 01:00:52.510
they create home price futures
based on our indexes.

01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:59.840
It was disappointing;
we couldn't get anyone to do it.

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:01.840
I thought we had such a strong
case.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:04.679
Shouldn't there be a futures
market?

01:01:04.679 --> 01:01:07.986
We went to the--I mentioned the
coffee, sugar,

01:01:07.986 --> 01:01:11.812
cocoa--we tried them all.
So, we'd go to these guys and

01:01:11.812 --> 01:01:14.480
they're trading coffee,
sugar, and cocoa.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:19.789
I said, look coffee is nice,
everyone wants their cup in the

01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:25.010
morning, but we're talking about
twenty trillion dollars of

01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:28.055
unhedged risk.
Most households in the United

01:01:28.055 --> 01:01:31.210
States--that's what they own.
The typical household--they

01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:35.370
don't own much stock;
they own real estate and they

01:01:35.370 --> 01:01:38.813
can't hedge it.
I think we had the most

01:01:38.813 --> 01:01:42.289
progress with the Chicago Board
of Trade;

01:01:42.289 --> 01:01:45.989
they actually did some research
with us.

01:01:45.989 --> 01:01:49.052
The funny thing that happened
was that CBOT did research in

01:01:49.052 --> 01:01:51.902
1994 on whether they should set
up a futures market for

01:01:51.902 --> 01:01:54.713
single-family homes.
The basic conclusion--they made

01:01:54.713 --> 01:01:57.552
a lot of phone calls--that's how
they did research--asking

01:01:57.552 --> 01:01:59.940
people,
are you worried about your home

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:03.782
price falling and would you like
to be able to hedge the risk in

01:02:03.782 --> 01:02:07.198
the futures market the way
farmers do in the agricultural

01:02:07.198 --> 01:02:10.319
market?
Basically, the answer was no

01:02:10.319 --> 01:02:13.989
and people said,
I don't worry about my home

01:02:13.989 --> 01:02:17.482
price falling.
So, they didn't want to start a

01:02:17.482 --> 01:02:21.304
market because they thought--but
I was going around saying,

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:24.050
don't you know?
There's no law of economics

01:02:24.050 --> 01:02:26.130
saying that home prices don't
fall.

01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:29.233
They did--they have fallen;
they fell a lot in the

01:02:29.233 --> 01:02:32.289
Depression and they could do it
again.

01:02:32.289 --> 01:02:36.471
So, why don't people want to
have a market that would--they

01:02:36.471 --> 01:02:39.159
don't just go steadily up.
But people said,

01:02:39.159 --> 01:02:40.960
well the Depression--that was
so long ago;

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:44.858
we can't remember that.
So, we couldn't seem to get

01:02:44.858 --> 01:02:49.131
anyone focused on it.
I think there's something about

01:02:49.131 --> 01:02:54.447
this that we learned about the
origins of our current economic

01:02:54.447 --> 01:02:57.187
situation.
We went around to a lot of

01:02:57.187 --> 01:03:00.339
people trying to get them
interested in hedging real

01:03:00.339 --> 01:03:03.133
estate prices.
Remember, the purpose of

01:03:03.133 --> 01:03:06.660
futures markets is not gambling;
it's hedging;

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:10.198
it's protecting yourself.
I should write that term on the

01:03:10.198 --> 01:03:16.309
board as well.
Hedging--I hope I made this

01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:18.980
clear.
If you are running--let's go

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:22.304
back to wheat.
If you have a warehouse full of

01:03:22.304 --> 01:03:26.556
wheat, you are a wheat
warehouser and you are like a

01:03:26.556 --> 01:03:29.730
stable business.
So, what do you do?

01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:31.989
You don't know what the price
of wheat is going to do;

01:03:31.989 --> 01:03:33.760
it goes up and down
internationally.

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.692
So, what do you do?
You sell it in the futures

01:03:36.692 --> 01:03:40.324
market and that means you've
hedged your risk of wheat

01:03:40.324 --> 01:03:42.474
prices.
If wheat prices go down,

01:03:42.474 --> 01:03:46.258
true the value of the stuff in
storage that you own is going to

01:03:46.258 --> 01:03:48.791
go down,
but offsetting that is your

01:03:48.791 --> 01:03:51.549
futures contract price,
which will go up,

01:03:51.549 --> 01:03:54.099
and that hedging will protect
you.

01:03:54.099 --> 01:03:58.860
You have reduced risk of your
business and this is done a lot.

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:00.535
Holbrook Working,
in the reading,

01:04:00.535 --> 01:04:03.320
talks about that.
So, farmers also can hedge;

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:06.927
they've got wheat growing in
the fields and they're worried

01:04:06.927 --> 01:04:10.969
about the price they can sell it
at, so let's lock it in today;

01:04:10.969 --> 01:04:13.630
let's sell in the futures
market.

01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:17.627
If the price of wheat declines,
your short position in the

01:04:17.627 --> 01:04:21.205
futures market will appreciate
and offset your loss,

01:04:21.205 --> 01:04:26.901
so you want to hedge your risk.
We went around asking people,

01:04:26.901 --> 01:04:33.719
don't you want to hedge your
risk in the real estate market?

01:04:33.719 --> 01:04:35.844
Unfortunately,
people are rather confused

01:04:35.844 --> 01:04:38.500
about that and they're not used
to hedging that.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:46.036
Anyway, with the recent boom in
home prices, we were able--we

01:04:46.036 --> 01:04:53.699
finally approached the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in 2006 and

01:04:53.699 --> 01:04:56.426
said,
we want to work with you to

01:04:56.426 --> 01:05:00.270
create--try to create--a futures
market for single family homes.

01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:07.340
They said, okay let's try it.
So, this was what we did in May

01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:10.023
of 2006;
we created a futures

01:05:10.023 --> 01:05:14.823
market--not the very first,
there was an attempt in London

01:05:14.823 --> 01:05:19.103
in 1991 that failed,
but we were essentially the

01:05:19.103 --> 01:05:23.444
first futures market for
single-family homes in the

01:05:23.444 --> 01:05:27.417
United States.
This market has been in

01:05:27.417 --> 01:05:31.869
backwardation almost from the
first day.

01:05:31.869 --> 01:05:36.474
When we opened the market in
May of 2006, our market maker,

01:05:36.474 --> 01:05:40.920
who was brought in by the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange,

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:44.890
thought like everyone else who
reads the newspapers--well,

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:49.845
home prices just always go up.
So, the market maker put out a

01:05:49.845 --> 01:05:55.477
bid-asked that implied contango
in the market--that home prices

01:05:55.477 --> 01:05:59.086
would go up.
The market maker quickly

01:05:59.086 --> 01:06:03.860
learned that there was no
market--contango market.

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:09.035
After losing a huge amount of
money, he pushed his bid-asked

01:06:09.035 --> 01:06:14.122
spreads into the backwardation
range and left it there ever

01:06:14.122 --> 01:06:17.227
since.
This shows the backwardation in

01:06:17.227 --> 01:06:21.252
the futures market recently,
but it's been this way for a

01:06:21.252 --> 01:06:24.051
couple years now.
So, what's going on in the

01:06:24.051 --> 01:06:26.788
housing market?
I think that what has been

01:06:26.788 --> 01:06:30.730
happening is that newspapers,
and real estate agents,

01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:34.442
and lots of
commentators--people you see on

01:06:34.442 --> 01:06:40.010
the news--have been telling us
that home prices always go up;

01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:45.719
they've never fallen and don't
worry.

01:06:45.719 --> 01:06:48.701
A lot of casual people have
believed that,

01:06:48.701 --> 01:06:52.845
but the kind of people who
trade in futures markets didn't

01:06:52.845 --> 01:06:56.190
believe it, even going back to
early 2006.

01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:59.580
People who are ready to put
their money on the line have

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:03.340
been predicting a decline in
home prices now for two years.

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:07.129
You can see what dramatic
declines are being predicted in

01:07:07.129 --> 01:07:09.930
our futures market.
I have it for various

01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:12.099
cities--Boston,
Chicago, Denver.

01:07:12.099 --> 01:07:16.014
We have separate markets for
each of the ten--of these ten

01:07:16.014 --> 01:07:18.074
cities--Las Vegas,
Los Angeles,

01:07:18.074 --> 01:07:21.440
Miami, New York,
San Diego and San Francisco.

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:27.343
The worst market of them all is
Miami and this market is

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:33.353
predicting almost a 35% home
price decline by November of

01:07:33.353 --> 01:07:36.903
2012.
The second worst--what is the

01:07:36.903 --> 01:07:39.195
second worst?
I can't quite read it;

01:07:39.195 --> 01:07:43.885
they kind of merged here.
There's a bunch of cities where

01:07:43.885 --> 01:07:48.010
the prediction is for a 20-25%
drop;

01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:52.203
the best city of all is
Chicago, but even there they're

01:07:52.203 --> 01:07:55.461
predicting a 7% drop.
So, we've seen a lot of

01:07:55.461 --> 01:07:59.175
backwardation in that market.
I think this is reflecting the

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:01.570
unusual economic circumstance
we're in.

01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:06.570
Finally, this is my last slide;
this shows the S&amp;P

01:08:06.570 --> 01:08:12.036
Case-Shiller Home Price Index.
That line is the actually home

01:08:12.036 --> 01:08:15.179
price index and it has these
jumps in it every month;

01:08:15.179 --> 01:08:17.659
that's because it's a monthly
index.

01:08:17.659 --> 01:08:21.685
We only publish it every month,
but you can see that it's been

01:08:21.685 --> 01:08:24.260
smooth.
It was increasing until around

01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:27.957
the time we started the futures
market and then it's been

01:08:27.957 --> 01:08:30.399
declining at an accelerating
rate.

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:36.160
We are now down in real terms
about 15% nationwide on home

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:39.899
prices, which peaked in early
2006.

01:08:39.899 --> 01:08:44.343
This is the futures price that
we've had and that's for the

01:08:44.343 --> 01:08:48.479
closest futures contract--the
nearest to expiration.

01:08:48.479 --> 01:08:51.100
We're hoping to get a lot of
publicity for this because we

01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:53.170
thought this was a very
interesting number.

01:08:53.170 --> 01:08:57.599
This is futures market price
for homes and it moves around

01:08:57.599 --> 01:09:00.111
day by day.
All those little wiggles

01:09:00.111 --> 01:09:03.739
reflect new information that
came in on a particular day.

01:09:03.739 --> 01:09:06.680
Unfortunately,
we have not been able to get

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:10.600
much attention for this number,
but there's been a lot of

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:14.449
attention to the S&amp;P
Case-Shiller Home Price Indexes

01:09:14.449 --> 01:09:17.314
now.
In fact, we're getting

01:09:17.314 --> 01:09:23.020
newspaper stories all the time
written about our indexes,

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:26.518
but they don't write about our
market, so we've had trouble

01:09:26.518 --> 01:09:28.630
getting a futures market
started.

01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:32.170
It's going, but it's going only
at a low level.

01:09:32.170 --> 01:09:35.944
I think that in the future this
will take off eventually and I

01:09:35.944 --> 01:09:39.720
think that we'll have futures
markets for many more things.

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.851
Eventually, we'll have a
futures market for New Haven as

01:09:42.851 --> 01:09:44.913
well.
Right now, New Haven is too

01:09:44.913 --> 01:09:47.439
small to warrant its own futures
market.

01:09:47.439 --> 01:09:50.145
So, I was thinking,
well someone in New Haven could

01:09:50.145 --> 01:09:52.850
just buy two--if you wanted to
hedge your house,

01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:56.164
you'd sell two New York
contracts and one Boston

01:09:56.164 --> 01:09:58.587
contract.
I'm sort of interpolating

01:09:58.587 --> 01:10:02.276
between New York and Boston,
but eventually we have to do

01:10:02.276 --> 01:10:06.361
better than that and I'm hopeful
that there will be a day in my

01:10:06.361 --> 01:10:10.050
lifetime when we'll see all
cities of the world traded on

01:10:10.050 --> 01:10:12.667
futures market.
In my new book,

01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:15.626
Subprime Solution,
I also claim,

01:10:15.626 --> 01:10:19.130
and I think I have some basis
to say this,

01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:22.102
that it will help reduce
bubbles and help reduce this

01:10:22.102 --> 01:10:24.128
kind of instability.
Next period,

01:10:24.128 --> 01:10:27.588
we're going to talk about
options and then we have only

01:10:27.588 --> 01:10:31.634
one more lecture;
the last lecture on the

01:10:31.634 --> 01:10:33.500
democratization of finance.

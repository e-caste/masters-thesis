00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.753
(solemn music)

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.160
- But today is a kind of
second introductory lecture

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.530
where we're gonna be thinking about

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.940
the origins of the nation in
particular, as with last time,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.160
I'm gonna toss you some
what I think are softballs,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.640
but also feel free to raise
your hand and interrupt,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.530
because that can help me when I understand

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.210
that something's really not coming across

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.200
or something is unclear.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.310
So just feel free to interrupt

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.770
and ask a question anytime you want.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.510
So this lecture is called
The Genesis of Nations,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.350
and it's about a question,
which I raised last time,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.044
which has kind of been a
question puzzling philosophers

00:00:46.044 --> 00:00:47.910
from the beginning of philosophy,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.493
which is how do you get
from something to nothing?

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.700
At some point there
wasn't a Ukrainian nation

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.447
and at some point there
is a Ukrainian nation.

00:00:56.447 --> 00:00:58.020
How does that happen?

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.590
How do you get social forms
to come into existence

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.840
that didn't exist before?

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.080
It's a really interesting question.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.503
And you can ask it with other
social formations as well.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.290
There didn't used to be classes,

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.090
but now we don't have any difficult--

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.230
I don't mean the classes that you're in.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.570
I mean, social classes,
right? Economic classes.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.920
Those didn't use to exist either,

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.350
but now we don't have
much trouble identifying,

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.520
oh, he's middle class.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.270
Actually we're in America,
so everybody's middle class.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.920
Thinking that everyone's middle class

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.800
is part of the class struggle,
I'm sure you know that.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.180
So if you all think you're middle class,

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.530
that means you're already in, okay.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.270
Sorry that wasn't our
subject today at all.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.190
We're gonna move back to nations.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.023
Although the Marxists

00:01:39.023 --> 00:01:40.740
are gonna get a little shout out later on

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.510
because actually Marxists
were some of the first people

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.580
to think about the nation.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.500
But when we're thinking
about this social form

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.130
of the nation, what makes
it particularly tricky

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.130
is that the nation, once it
exists, lays claim to the past.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.620
So the nation didn't always exist

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.560
but once it comes into existence,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.470
it tells a story about the past

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.853
and the story that the nation
tells about the past is wrong.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.000
That's the short version.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.850
It tells a story which clears out the past

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.910
and that story calls itself history.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.300
Although it's not really
history, it calls itself history.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.230
And so this new social form has a story

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.130
about how it's very old and
that confusion is confusion

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.220
that basically everyone
lives their whole life with.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.270
Unless you're American.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.100
If you're American,
then your national story

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.960
is that you're new and you're fresh

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.130
and you're all about the future,

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.200
which is ironic because
the American nation

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.050
is actually comparatively
speaking, quite old.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.040
It's funny, right?

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.110
It's actually older than
most of the European nations,

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.290
but don't tell the Europeans
and don't tell the Americans,

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.700
'cause that would mess everybody up.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.700
So the trick though is
that the nation is modern,

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.410
but it lays claim to the past

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.520
in a way which if we ourselves
are at all nationally minded

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.050
and many of us probably are,
feels comfortable and right.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.840
And that makes it very hard
to answer this question

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.430
of where the nation came from

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.313
because the nation is
already giving you an answer.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.210
The nation comes equipped with an answer.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.490
It comes equipped in the most banal

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.930
and obvious practical sense,

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.810
which you've already encountered
in your lives probably,

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.520
which is that as you're educated,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.930
as you go through elementary school,

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.340
middle school, high school,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.130
if you're in anything like a
national educational system,

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.110
you're given answers to these questions,

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.380
which seem self-evident as
to where the nation came from.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.960
But of course, there's a
circular phenomenon here,

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.540
which is that once there's
a national consciousness,

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.160
once there's a national identity,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.210
then the educational system
takes on a national character

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.690
and then reproduces that national
consciousness and identity

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.690
in a way which then starts
to seem unproblematic

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.370
and commonsensical.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.680
So there's a circular quality about this,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.600
which is very hard to break out of

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.490
when you're seven years old.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.130
I mean, I'm sure all of you
are smarter than average

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.140
and each one of you is smarter
than the person next to you.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.820
I'm aware of this, you're Yale students,

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.700
but when you were seven, you pro--

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.260
Okay, six.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.690
When you were six, you probably
weren't raising your hand

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.300
and talking about the constructed
character of national--

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.500
Right? You probably weren't.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.840
You were probably, I don't know.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.430
Correct me, but I imagine

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.500
that what they told you about
the past in your schools,

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.060
you were probably either ignoring it

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.700
or somehow taking it in
to some extent, right?

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.317
Thank you for those nods.
That's very affirming.

00:04:32.317 --> 00:04:36.240
So the obvious way that this happens

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.170
is the institutional way.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.490
The nation takes over the state,

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.750
the state takes over the education,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.240
the education takes over the kids

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.650
and then the kids believe the things

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.040
which are commonsensical and
99 times out of a hundred

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.240
and I say this as a historian

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.030
who gets trapped in cocktail
parties all the time in corners

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.280
with people who know what
really happened in the past,

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.970
99 times out of a hundred,
you never break free, right?

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.050
99 times out of a hundred,

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.750
you're basically trapped
where they pinned you down

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.750
when you were seven.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.190
The less obvious way that the
nation gets hold of the past

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.800
has to do not with the institutions,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.840
but with the form of the story.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.940
And I'm gonna tell you a
couple forms of the story

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.670
and try to make them
seem less commonsensical

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.580
or less obvious, less
natural than they are.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.340
I called this maybe a
little bit too preciously,

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.800
I called this lecture
The Genesis of Nations,

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.680
because now I'm gonna talk about Genesis.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.500
A great story about the nation

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.010
is that there once was innocence
and the innocence was lost.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.990
That is a big story about the nation,

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.380
especially nations that
emerge out of empires.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.768
Especially nations like the Russian.

00:05:42.768 --> 00:05:44.610
I'm not gonna talk about
too much about America,

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.140
but it's certainly true of America too.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.910
There's an American imperial story

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.310
about how things were at some point,

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.250
the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, 1950s.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.960
At some point, things were fine.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.790
At some point, things were good.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.360
And then somehow the immigrants
got in and we lost control

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.950
and now things aren't so good.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.170
That's a story of innocence.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.940
If you're about making
the country great again,

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:06.900
like a cycle.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.910
You go back to a cycle
where there's a point

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.400
or the founders are another
good example of this.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.913
So some people think that
the moment of 1776 or 1789

00:06:14.913 --> 00:06:17.400
is a kind of moment of innocence.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.350
The founders got it basically right.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.270
That's a very attractive idea.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.530
The founders thought of everything,

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.580
they're kind of demigods.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.790
They walk the earth, leaving
huge footprints behind them

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.500
and the footprints were
filled with the water

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.790
and residue of righteousness.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.050
And that's all you have to know.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.000
That's a very attractive view.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.460
Somebody got everything right
at one point in time.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.260
Most of the Supreme Court now

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.243
pretends to believe this at this point.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.530
By the way, you know what the
problem with originalism is?

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.880
I realize this is not our subject at all

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.870
so you don't have to take notes.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.660
But there's a school of
thought called originalism

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.250
about the American Constitution,

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.100
which says that you have
to take the Constitution

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.320
only in terms of what it actually says.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.050
But you know what the
Constitution doesn't say?

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.940
It doesn't say that you have
to take the Constitution

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.440
the way that the
Constitution actually says.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.360
That is to say the originalist position

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.520
is self-contradictory
because the originalist position

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.893
is not actually in the
Constitution, right?

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.830
Okay. I've blown your minds, right?

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.860
All right.
(students laughing)

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.320
But I'm only saying this by way

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.130
of this general imperial nation problem

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.170
of wanting to go back to a moment

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.360
where somehow we got everything right.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.240
In Russia today, this is very evident

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.473
in the thought of a
character called Ivan Ilyin,

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.120
who for several years Putin read

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.040
and who takes a view like
this, that the world is flawed.

00:07:44.187 --> 00:07:49.187
The world itself is flawed, but
Russia has a kind of mission

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.163
of restoring the innocence of the world.

00:07:54.203 --> 00:07:55.830
I mean, it's kind of ironic,

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.930
but very often it's the imperial nations,

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:00.630
the post-imperial nations
that are focused on innocence.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.173
They're focused on a time
when everything was all right.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.780
Nations that are peripheral

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.720
or are anti-colonial, anti-imperial

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.240
very often have a different
structure of story,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.890
which I wanna try to make seem

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.780
both familiar and
unfamiliar to you if I can.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.780
And that's a three part story.
And again, it's biblical.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.790
So the story of lost
innocence is of course,

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.800
the story of Adam and
Eve, the garden of Eden.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.160
There's also a longer
story in the Hebrew Bible,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.540
the Old Testament about a
people which had a state,

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.490
but then that mistakes were made

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.490
or bad people came and
they lost their state.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.980
But at some point they're
gonna get their state back.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.210
And when they get their state back,

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:43.762
everything's gonna be fine.

00:08:43.762 --> 00:08:48.210
That's a structural story
that's inside the Bible.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:49.140
People have different views

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.150
about how it's gonna be right again.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.120
The Christians say Jesus came
and then everything was fine.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.640
Zionists might say we made
Israel, then everything was fine.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.770
You can be in disagreement
about when everything is fine,

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.290
but there's still the
basic three part story

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:06.290
of everything was once good,
then we lost it somehow.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.760
Probably not our fault,
probably somebody else's fault,

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.810
but we lost it.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.720
But then there will be
a moment of redemption.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.720
So the nation takes over
this story very easily.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:18.750
You've probably heard phrases

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:23.703
like national renaissance, a rebirth.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:25.620
The whole idea of rebirth

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.020
is if you think about
it just for a second,

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.473
in some kind of literal
way, it's a very weird idea.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.233
It's very weird.

00:09:33.233 --> 00:09:35.760
If you just think for
a quarter of a second,

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.170
what it would be like to be reborn,

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.213
wouldn't that be strange, right?

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.120
Okay, this may be a little too Freudian,

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.743
you just left home, I know.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.950
But a rebirth is a strange idea

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.400
if you think about it at all.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.480
So the idea of a national rebirth

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.820
is that you're going back to that time

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.560
when everything was right.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.200
You're going back to that golden age.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.780
Usually the nation says we're
in some kind of middle period

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.980
where things have gone wrong,

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.110
but everything used to be right.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.840
And if you're an anti-colonial
or a post-colonial nation,

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.670
the story usually has
to do with the people.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:12.324
The people were right and good.

00:10:12.324 --> 00:10:14.850
They're still somehow
basically right and good

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.190
and we're gonna restore
that rightness and goodness

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:20.070
by giving them a state and
then things are gonna be fine.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.210
There's been a middle period,

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.760
which involves a diaspora or an empire

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.290
or something messing things up.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.450
But in the future,
things are gonna be good.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.700
So notice the three part story.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.300
The three part story is very
widespread. Very widespread.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.940
Classical examples are
the Jewish national story,

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.980
the Greek national story.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.350
And I mentioned in the last
lecture, the Jews and Greeks

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.240
are actually the oldest
documented inhabitants

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.890
of the territory of Ukraine.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.750
But basically, every national story

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.720
has cottoned onto this,
has followed this pattern.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.150
So I'm gonna say the obvious thing now.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.280
It's not that this is true.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.410
It's not that there
ever was a pure nation.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:00.270
It's not that there was an ethnicity

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.790
which existed a thousand years
ago and still exists today.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.380
I hope I'm not shattering
anybody's illusions,

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.993
but that never actually happens.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.870
I know I'm breaking something to you now,

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.340
but somebody has to at some point.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.433
Relationships are a lot more
complicated than that, right?

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.220
Fatherhood and motherhood and sex.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.320
It's a lot more complicated
than a straight line

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.150
from a thousand years to now.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.748
Okay. I'm glad we had this moment.

00:11:27.748 --> 00:11:30.720
I feel like this awkwardness
has now been dealt with.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.833
Okay, good.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.940
So I'm not gonna surprise you

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.010
when I say that that's not
how history actually works.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.960
There isn't really a three part.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.140
There isn't really a golden
age, diaspora return to gold.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.910
That doesn't really happen.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.870
But the story is reflecting something.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.210
It's reflecting a change
that is happening.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:55.290
It's a way of handling a
change which is happening.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:12:00.290
And that change is the entrance
of the people into politics.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.040
So the nation and the way
we're talking about the nation

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.350
is a modern form of politics,

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.090
which involves, if not everybody,

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.340
it's meant to involve the masses.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.900
It's not feudalism.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.120
It's not the nobility
being in charge, right?

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.020
It's not monarchy, it's not
aristocracy, it's not oligarchy,

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.730
it's not rule by the few.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.530
The nation means rule by the many.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:23.790
Doesn't necessarily mean democracy,

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.920
but the nation means a form of politics

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.200
in which the subject of politics

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.409
is supposed to be the people.

00:12:31.409 --> 00:12:34.380
That's an idea which seems
very commonsensical now.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.910
I mean, even the people who are against it

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:38.550
say that they're for it
as you might have noticed.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.950
Basically everybody in the world,

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.351
as they do away with democracy,
they talk about how, yes,

00:12:43.351 --> 00:12:45.360
the only way to have democracy

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.060
is to suppress all of these votes.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.220
Only if I count the votes
it's a demo-- you know.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.700
But very rarely people say,
oh, I'm against democracy.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.910
It's commonsensical. But
that's very new, right?

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.520
The idea that the people
are the subject of politics

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.749
is only a couple hundred years old.

00:13:01.749 --> 00:13:06.749
So these stories are a way
of handling a transformation.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.640
They're a way of handling change.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.860
So now I'm moving from what
they say about themselves

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.870
to how they actually work.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.280
The reason that they actually work

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.330
is that in the 19th century,
let's say, more or less,

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.150
there comes a time when you have to handle

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:25.500
a form of politics in which
the people now matter,

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.540
large numbers of people now matter.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.720
And so you need some version of the past

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.310
which accounts for that.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:34.740
And the version of the
past that you can give

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.010
is the one that says way back when,

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:39.600
the people were in charge

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.730
and now the people are
gonna be in charge again.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.070
Or way back when, the people were virtuous

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.380
and now they're gonna be virtuous again

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.170
once we do away with the
empire or the diaspora

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:51.030
or one of the things which was in the way

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.440
of this pattern from happening.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.160
So the story is a way of
making sense of something,

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.610
making sense of a challenge,
which actually had to be met.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.710
And the challenge is what do you do

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.450
as the people enter politics?

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.760
That's a challenge which was
met in all kinds of other ways.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.190
Like the Marxists who we're
still gonna talk about

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:10.650
met the challenge in a certain way.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.470
So the people are entering politics,

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.420
there is some kind of transformation.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.863
And I want you to mark this.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.800
We'll get to this part of the
course here in a few weeks,

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.340
but think about what is changing.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.850
Is it that there's now
a big capitalist economy

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.640
and so people are encountering
each other in new ways.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.940
Is it that there's now a functional state,

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.440
which is able to collect taxes

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.750
and make people perform military service.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.570
These are some of the
changes that are associated

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:41.310
with modernization.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.260
But something is changing

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.283
so that it no longer seems normal to say

00:14:46.283 --> 00:14:49.430
that the king is just in charge

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.060
or the nobility is just in charge.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.500
Something is changing so that

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.380
that no longer seems plausible.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.900
There's still kings and queens,

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.690
but they basically serve as
the kind of rhetorical cover

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.089
for welfare states.

00:15:02.089 --> 00:15:04.923
They're not what they used to be.

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:11.197
Fascinating as they are, the
adventures of Harry and Meghan,

00:15:11.197 --> 00:15:15.423
that's not what royalty used to be like.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.060
It was a little like that,

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.970
but that was never the essence of it.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:24.480
So at a certain point, it
stopped seeming plausible

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.860
that a few people should be in charge

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:26.970
and how do you handle that?

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.773
Well, you handle that with a story.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.330
So you have modern politics

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.060
and modern politics has to have a story

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.120
about how the people are
coming into politics,

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.950
why the people should come into politics.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:43.560
And this story is
displacing other stories.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.910
Okay, here comes question time.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.500
What's another story?

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.500
What kind of story would
that have been displacing?

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.750
What's a story that
would've made sense? Yeah.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.310
- [Student] So a king is chosen

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:55.560
by some religious, like God, right?

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.170
Now I'm the king and I control society.

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:00.270
- Yeah, okay. So divine right.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:02.880
Or you're the king,
because how about this?

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.063
You're the king because
your father was king.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:08.460
I mean, that seems ridiculous, right?

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.370
Just because his father was
king he gets to be king?

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.530
Doesn't that seem insane?

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.000
Was your father king?
- No.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.080
- Okay good.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:16.913
'Cause I get in trouble

00:16:16.913 --> 00:16:19.560
if I get into revealing
your personal life.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.420
So if anybody's father is king,

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:24.453
I need to know now or in an
email preferably, all right.

00:16:26.722 --> 00:16:29.250
It could be. All right.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:34.154
So that notion, so his father
was king and his father,

00:16:34.154 --> 00:16:36.900
it's absurd, doesn't it seem?

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.630
But in other historical circumstances,

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:41.490
it could have made perfect sense.

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.200
It obviously did make perfect sense,

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.480
but not in modern historical circumstances

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.510
it somehow seems not to make
sense, but it's a story.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:49.620
The story of genealogy,

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.540
the story that his family is
better than other families.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:56.400
Perhaps they're half
gods, something, right?

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.213
What's another kind of story
that this could have displaced?

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.880
Yeah.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.713
- [Student] Something related,

00:17:03.713 --> 00:17:07.260
but just like landowning
people or landowning--

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.720
- Good. Excellent.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.330
Excellent. That's a very
good example as well.

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:15.240
But it can be related
because the right to property

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.430
is inherited.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.220
I mean, that's something which
is still true in our system.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.350
And it's commonsensical.

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.943
If Zhenya has a bunch of land.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.130
If I have a million acres,

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:27.810
why shouldn't my children
have a million acres?

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.300
It still seems commonsensical.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.723
But the idea that there's a property class

00:17:33.723 --> 00:17:37.860
and the right to own property
is something special.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.500
So you people over here have
the right to own property

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.330
and the rest of you have the right

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.683
to work on their property.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.660
That seemed plausible
for hundreds of years,

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.010
but at a certain point around again,

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.230
around the 19th century, it
stopped seeming plausible.

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.420
But that story that
not just that a person,

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.730
but that a group is maybe
different from another group.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.620
Maybe the nobility thinks
that it's descended

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.020
from other people, it often did, right?

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.510
Or the nobility has earned
rights because historically,

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.000
the nobility fought the wars or something,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.901
but they're different,
they have the right to rule

00:18:07.901 --> 00:18:09.810
and they have the right to own land.

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.240
So those are different
stories which are displaced

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.760
by the national story or
challenged by the national story.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.610
And they represent different
kinds of political systems.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.920
For example, let's imagine
an absolute monarchy

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.110
or let's imagine a system
that we'll come to,

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:23.970
like the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth,

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.310
where the noble class gets to vote

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.380
and the noble class gets to own land,

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.813
but other people don't.

00:18:29.813 --> 00:18:32.613
And at a certain point, that
starts to seem problematic.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.790
So we have a story that brings the people

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.730
to the center of politics,

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.434
but doesn't say that directly, right?

00:18:41.434 --> 00:18:46.434
It seems to make all
of history make sense.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:49.320
It's a story that brings
people to the center.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.690
And this is where I have
to talk about Marxism

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:55.260
because it might have occurred
to you that this whole,

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.153
I'm not gonna check you on this.

00:18:58.712 --> 00:19:00.450
And I don't know how many of you

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.520
know very much about Marxism

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.133
or how much that comes
across your education.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.770
When I ask this in graduate classes,

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.320
there's the guy who raises his
hand or the woman, it's like,

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.540
yeah, I grew up in the
People's Republic of China

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.313
and we studied Marxism.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.730
So you might have noticed

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:21.363
that Marxism also has a three part story.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.740
Marxism also has a
story about a golden age

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:27.330
and about transformation

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.340
and about the people coming
to the center of politics.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.020
In the Marxist story,

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.200
it used to be that none
of us owned any property

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.250
and that was fine.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.530
And then technology came along

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:41.880
and technology created
new social relations.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.910
And along with them came private property.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.670
Private property alienated
us from ourselves, bad.

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:52.080
But one day we will get
rid of private property

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.610
and we will all seize it together

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:54.690
and that will be good again.

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:58.500
Okay, I'm simplifying this a lot.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.220
But there's also a three part
story. Interestingly, right?

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.230
Marxism and the modern idea of the nation

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:05.760
actually emerge at about the same time,

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.530
around the middle of the 19th century.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.140
And they're very much in
dialogue with one another.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.840
And they're actually very similar,

00:20:13.015 --> 00:20:15.420
one difference being
that the Marxist story

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.650
is about the class.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:20.040
It's about a non-national
class, a working class.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.220
Whereas the national story
is about particular nations.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.230
It's about particularities.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:30.000
Or to put it in a different
way, the national story...

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.416
Don't hide your phone
behind your computer.

00:20:32.416 --> 00:20:34.920
The national...

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.300
Don't use electronics at all.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.773
The national story is
pretends to be just about you.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.440
But in fact, everybody's
national story is very similar.

00:20:46.004 --> 00:20:49.473
The Marxist story is supposed
to be about everyone,

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.620
but in fact, the Marxists
had a terrible time

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.873
getting the various nations to line up.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.550
So the two stories are our
in tension with one another.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:03.333
Does anyone know what the
Marxists say about the nation?

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:05.880
What the Marxists
thought about the nation,

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.833
especially at the beginning?

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.173
Or wanna take a guess?

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.200
Or not.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.033
Yeah?
- [Student] Did they think

00:21:14.033 --> 00:21:15.870
it was gonna be a transitional state?

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:17.730
- Good, true.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.730
They associated the nation with capital--

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.800
either with feudalism or with capitalism,

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.910
but not with socialism.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:25.800
So we're gonna get over it. Yeah.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.120
Jack?

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.160
- [Student] Political
and economic revolution.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.890
So transition to this socialism movement.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.530
- That's in the Soviet Union. Yeah.

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:34.920
So the Soviet Union is an attempt

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.020
to go through all the stages very quickly.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.110
And so in the Soviet Union,
the idea is that first,

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:43.200
we're gonna do the capitalist
style modernization.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.420
And with that, will come
the nation, that's in 1920s.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.430
And then in the 1930s we'll
have an economic revolution

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.230
where maybe we'll get through the nation

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.060
very quickly that way.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.310
So the basic idea that the Marxists have

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:54.968
is that the nation is associated

00:21:54.968 --> 00:21:57.183
with a period of history that's passing.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.690
And this is where they have trouble.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.420
But if there's capitalism
and the capitalism advancing,

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.580
and there's more nationalism,

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:08.010
that's a kind of misunderstanding.

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:12.720
So Marx and Engels had
a tremendous problem

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.970
with actual workers because actual workers

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.600
were very often in favor of
imperialism, for example.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.210
They had a tremendous
problem with actual workers

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:24.390
who were influenced by
the national politics,

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:25.800
who had turned out,

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.260
were as nationally oriented
or more nationally oriented

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:32.580
than the middle classes or the nobility.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.370
So nationalism has a
tremendous problem or sorry,

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.980
Marxism has a tremendous
problem with nationalism.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.230
And as a result of this,

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:45.180
some of the first people who
theorized about the nation

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.560
in an interesting way,

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:51.560
were Marxists who were trying
to deal with this problem.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.370
Around the year 1900,

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:59.610
there were several Marxists
who said essentially,

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:03.000
look, modernization isn't doing away

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.450
with the national
question, on the contrary,

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:08.620
modernization is bringing about the nation

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.651
and we have to deal with that.

00:23:11.651 --> 00:23:15.000
The nation isn't actually
part of the feudal past,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.230
it's part of the modern,
even the proletarian future.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:21.840
And so this was a Pole,
his name was Kelles-Krauz.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.890
And then he was in dialogue

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.740
with several people
called Austro-Marxists.

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.500
They made the argument,
an interesting argument,

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:32.867
that if you have capitalism
that uproots people

00:23:32.867 --> 00:23:35.970
from their local traditions

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.600
and forces them into a kind
of melting pot in the city

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.870
where the lowest common denominator
might be their language.

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:44.730
And so on the basis of their language

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:47.310
and feeling alienated
because they're uprooted,

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:50.160
they might seem to think,
okay, we're part of a nation

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.320
or they'd be vulnerable to politicians

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.790
who made that argument.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:56.970
They also said the modernizing state,

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:59.940
the modernizing state is
going to make people literate.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.920
This is what the modernizing state does.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.110
It educates people. It
makes people literate.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:06.330
At the end of the 19th
century, early 20th century

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.970
in European countries, you
go from very low literacy

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:11.940
to very, very high rates
of literacy very quickly.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.310
But literacy can also mean

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:16.950
not identifying with an imperial center,

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:18.630
but identifying with a nation

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:20.700
because you're reading
perhaps in your own language

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.533
or you learn to read in one language,

00:24:21.533 --> 00:24:23.100
then you learn to read
in a different language.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.550
And so these guys made this argument,

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:29.520
which was then repeated in the 1980s

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.870
by a number of national theorists

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:33.840
or these kinds of arguments
were made in the 1980s

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.320
by some important interesting
national theorists

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.743
called Ernest Gellner
and Benedict Anderson.

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:44.910
Who also said that the
nation is not ancient,

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:49.563
but it's a result of certain
kinds of modernization.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:55.200
So that's the short course on the theories

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.823
of where nations come about.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.000
What I'm trying to say
is that this argument

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.570
about the theory of
how nations come about,

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:06.510
goes back almost as far
as the nation, right?

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:10.623
So the position that nations
aren't old, they're new.

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:14.440
People have been saying that
for more than a hundred years.

00:25:17.698 --> 00:25:20.280
National theorists will generally say

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.950
oh, everyone who talks about
the nation, they're stupid.

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:24.600
They're unaware of the fact

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.980
that it's politically constructed.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:26.813
No, no, no.

00:25:26.813 --> 00:25:27.660
There's been awareness

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.100
that it might be politically constructed

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.700
for almost as long as there's
been the nation itself.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.040
This discussion that we're
having now has been going on

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.020
for almost as long as
the nation has existed.

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.730
Oh, by the way, this Kelles-Krauz guy.

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:41.700
I mention him partly because

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:46.007
he gives two interesting
examples for his argument

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.240
that the nation is all about modernity

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.563
and not about tradition.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.400
And his examples are the
Jews and the Ukrainians.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.400
So at the time when he was writing,

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.560
which was the early years
of the 20th century,

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.580
he died in 1905.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.980
So the very early years
of the 20th century,

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.110
the idea that Jews were a nation

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:09.030
was generally seen as absurd

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:11.070
because they lacked what
were thought of then

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:14.550
as the objective attributes of a nation.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:16.590
For example, territory.

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:18.960
And so Jews can't be a nation.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.660
Ukrainians were thought not to be a nation

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.210
because they lacked another
objective attribute,

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:27.510
which was a historical political class.

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.580
So if your theory of the nation

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:32.640
is that there is certain durable stuff,

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.580
like land or like a political class,

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.080
and that those make up the nation,

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.720
then you look at the
Ukrainians and the Jews in 1904

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.610
and you'd say, no, they're not nations.

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.380
The Hungarians maybe, the Poles maybe,

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.440
the Germans certainly, but not
the Ukrainians and the Jews.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.490
What Kelles-Krauz said is think
about it in a different way.

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:52.710
Bracket what you think about the past,

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:57.060
look at the way modernization
affects people right now

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.880
and it turns out it
doesn't matter he argues,

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.447
whether or not there are these

00:27:01.447 --> 00:27:03.450
"objective attributes" or not.

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.340
All that matters is that modernization

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.760
is gonna generate the
processes, the alienation,

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.310
the urbanization, which
are gonna lead people

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:15.810
to these new forms of solidarity.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.120
And so when he said that
the Jews and the Ukrainians

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.060
were gonna be modern nations
in the early 20th century,

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.000
that was a very radical argument,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.310
but it was consistent with
the theory of the nation,

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:30.213
which says that the nation
is a result of modernization.

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:35.010
So that ends the part about
the theory of the nation.

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:37.680
I want to close by talking about

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:42.680
how some of our Ukrainians
thought about the nation.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:46.020
So we've talked about
the nation in general,

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.880
we've talked about theories of the nation.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.140
Now we're gonna talk about

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.990
some of how the Ukrainians
thought about the nation.

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:55.110
And it's important to be clear

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:59.550
that this whole thing is a
very self-conscious process.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:04.550
The people who made nations
knew what they were doing.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.240
They knew what they were doing.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.130
The way they talked about it
might be a little different

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:09.390
than how we would talk about it,

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:13.140
but no one slept-walked into nationhood.

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.583
That didn't happen that way.

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.990
There were larger processes
in the background, I think.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.100
We can keep talking about this.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:22.470
I think the modernization
people are right,

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:26.130
that larger processes in the
background like urbanization,

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:30.360
like capitalism, like
literacy made it likely

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.630
that some new form of
solidarity would emerge.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:38.630
But where, and for whom?

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.520
Where and for whom?

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:46.060
Why these nations and not other nations?

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:49.860
So again, going back to the
point I made at the beginning,

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.516
nations mess with the past.

00:28:52.516 --> 00:28:56.640
Once they're created,
they mess with the past.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.733
They make it very hard for
people to process the past.

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:02.550
It's like the periodic table's invented

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.140
and then it says everybody do alchemy.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.610
They mess with the past.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.710
And one of the ways the
nations mess with the past,

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:10.920
maybe the most profound one
is that they convince everyone

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.203
that their own existence is self-evident.

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:16.110
So if you're in Poland

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.970
and you grow up in the
Polish educational system,

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.530
many things might be uncertain,

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:23.700
but the existence of Poland
is not called into question.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:24.690
Even in the United States

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.420
where there's so many
obvious contingencies.

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:29.730
So many obvious contingencies.

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:32.220
It's very difficult to argue
that the United States,

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.920
that the revolution of 1776 had to happen

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.450
or that the Americans had to win

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.070
or in 1812, they had to win.

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:39.420
I mean, they should have lost in 1812.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.910
We, sorry, should have lost in 1812.

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:43.260
You know, the Louisiana Purchase.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:46.953
All this stuff, it obviously
didn't have to happen,

00:29:48.118 --> 00:29:50.583
or the border with
Canada, totally arbitrary.

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:52.700
I don't mean that in an aggressive way,

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.750
if there are any Canadians out there.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:56.820
It's cool. It's cool.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.720
It's fine with me.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:03.150
But even if you come to
an American school system,

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:04.650
the existence of America

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:06.030
isn't gonna be called
into question, right?

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:10.350
The first class, the teacher's
not gonna say, "By the way,

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.790
America didn't have to be.

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:14.550
Maybe it shouldn't have been.
Maybe that would've been cool.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:16.590
What if the British Empire
had been here longer?

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:18.600
Maybe that would've been better."

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.830
I'm gonna guess that didn't happen

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:22.650
in any of your classes, right?

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:25.013
All right. So we'll find out
where you went to school.

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:31.080
But the basic idea is the nation
makes itself self-evident.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.570
But it isn't, right? It isn't.

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:34.890
So when we study Ukraine,

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:37.950
we're gonna be studying the
formation of a political nation.

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:40.200
But what I don't want to think is,

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.690
wow, Ukraine is really
special 'cause it's political

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:44.463
and all the other nations are real.

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:48.540
That's a lesson that I
don't want you to draw.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.940
I want you to think 'hah, this is interesting'

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.560
how the Ukrainian nation

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.870
is maybe a little more
self-consciously political

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:56.850
or maybe it's been
forced into circumstances

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:59.040
which reveal the political
character of the nation

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.900
to our eyes a little more clearly

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.210
than with the French or
the Americans or whatever.

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:04.043
But I don't want you to think,

00:31:04.043 --> 00:31:05.580
oh yeah, the Ukrainians are kind of funky,

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:08.400
but everyone else has
a rock solid tradition.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.390
I don't want you to think that.

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:10.500
I want you to think, oh,

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.910
as we've studied the Ukrainian nation,

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:13.830
we're gonna see patterns
which maybe actually help us

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:17.040
to understand the Poles
better or the Russians better,

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.500
or even the Americans and the
British and the French better.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.323
So how did the Ukrainians
think about themselves?

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:27.153
In the 19th century,

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:32.550
the main move in the Russian
Empire and don't worry,

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:33.810
this is all gonna become clear

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:36.270
when the Russian Empire starts
and when it ends and so on.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:39.180
For now I just need you to
know that in the 19th century,

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:43.230
most people who spoke
the Ukrainian language

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:45.060
were in the Russian Empire.

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.830
And in the Russian Empire
in the 19th century,

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:50.850
the second half, there was this
idea of going to the people

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:52.350
which was called populism.

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:54.270
So not populism in the
sense that you're used to,

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:57.690
populism now means, I don't
know what it means, honestly,

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:00.090
but it means something like if you...

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:02.280
Okay, I'm not gonna go down that road.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.260
When people say populism,
they generally mean something

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.050
that's not liberalism that we don't like.

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:10.080
But populism in this sense
meant going to the people

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.700
and trying to figure
out who the people were.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:16.470
It was an urban movement
in the Russian Empire

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:18.600
associated with the science
of what was then called

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.210
ethnography that we now call anthropology.

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:23.430
Very influential in literature.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.410
Dostoevsky starts out being this way

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.330
and then goes to prison
and actually meets people

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:28.890
and changes his mind
about how great they are,

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:30.390
which is an interesting story.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.200
So going to the people

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.920
and so one source of the
Ukrainian national identity

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.640
is this empirical contact with the people

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.530
in the Russian Empire where you realize,

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:49.440
huh, their folklore and their songs

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.153
and their language are different.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.743
They're different.

00:32:53.743 --> 00:32:58.290
They just are different than
the peoples further north,

00:32:58.290 --> 00:32:59.730
the people who we now call the Russians.

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:02.190
And so you go to the people

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:05.400
and you discover that the society,

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.470
if you take it on its own terms,

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:08.610
is just a little bit different

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:11.037
and you start thinking about that.

00:33:11.037 --> 00:33:15.690
That populism leads to something

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:17.610
which we now call social history,

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:22.023
where you locate the nation.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.070
That's the Ukrainian
historian who did this,

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:37.070
where you locate the nation in
its own self-understanding,

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:38.610
in its customs, in its songs,

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:40.533
in its stories, in its language.

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:45.270
So in the 19th century,
that's a very strong movement.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:49.260
And so you then say, okay, the
nation has always been there

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.940
or it's been there for a really long time,

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:54.300
but it's not politically
represented and that's the problem.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.010
That's the problem.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:58.590
So you're replacing the kinds of

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:01.230
legitimating political
stories we talked about before

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:03.090
with a different political
legitimating story.

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:07.770
So it's not the czar
or the Polish landlords

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.890
who should control politics,
it should be the people

00:34:10.890 --> 00:34:12.000
because they've been here for a long time

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.380
and look how numerous they are.

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:15.360
And if you look at their customs,

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.880
you can see that they're in fact a unity.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.280
That's populism, that's social history,

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.540
that's going to the people.

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.040
And of course Mykhailo Hrushevs'kyi

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:27.180
wrote the very, very long
history which justifies all this.

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:28.710
There's a stage in the 19th century

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:31.770
where you have to write
a very long history

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:33.000
in order to esta--

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.350
I don't mean to make it sound like a joke,

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:37.500
'cause it's not easy, but you
have to write a long history

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.180
to document the continuity of the people

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:42.900
where social history is in the foreground

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:44.370
and the political history
is in the background

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:45.873
and that's a radical reversal.

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:48.810
Until then, generally
you could write history

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:49.710
with just the politics

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:53.463
and the people didn't have
to be present really at all.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:59.430
Now, the weakness of this
or a tendency within this

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.500
is that it will tend to move you

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.290
towards an ethnic understanding
of what the nation is.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:06.780
Because where you're
identifying the nation

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.810
is in its customs and
its language and so on.

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:11.340
Well, what if there are other people,

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:12.690
I've already mentioned
the Greeks and the Jews,

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:15.030
there are probably others in
Ukraine, we'll get to them.

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.990
But what if there are other people

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:17.700
who don't speak the same language

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.290
or who have markedly different customs?

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:20.933
What do you do with them?

00:35:20.933 --> 00:35:24.420
That's the problem of ethnicity.

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.340
That if you define the
nation in terms of customs,

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:28.140
then that always is going
to raise the question

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.303
of what about the other people?

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:33.270
And then here comes the interesting part.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:36.330
It's not that nobody
noticed this at the time.

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:40.533
The people who came up with the
ethnic notion of the nation,

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:43.920
this is a little logical point here,

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:48.300
but ethnicity didn't exist,
it was being created.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.320
So the people who came up

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.090
with the ethnic notion of the nation

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:52.980
were not ethnic themselves.

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:53.820
They couldn't have been

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.940
because the idea was just
kind of coming into being.

00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:00.030
And even if you don't buy
that and you believe, okay,

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:02.100
there was a thing called
ethnicity at the time,

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:05.490
they were very often
themselves coming from

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:08.250
what we would think of
as a minority position.

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:09.660
So Hrushevs'kyi,

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:12.030
as the Ukrainian historians
might not tell you,

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:17.030
had a Polish mom and that is very typical.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.510
Very typical.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:21.570
If you look at the people
who invented the populism,

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:22.403
the social history,

00:36:22.403 --> 00:36:24.720
and sometimes later
the ethnic nationalism,

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.340
all across Eastern Europe,

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:30.723
it is very often people who
were from a Jewish minority

00:36:30.723 --> 00:36:34.200
or a German minority,
or some kind of minority

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.320
who themselves adopt the ethnic position

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.820
or create the ethnic position.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.290
I say that not because
it's like a clever paradox,

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:47.850
but I say that to alert you to
the fact that the very thing

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:50.980
which is supposed to be the
most eternal and unchanging

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:53.283
is not, right?

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.660
The very notion of the eternity
and the unchangingness,

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.460
is created by people who are very often

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:02.280
changing themselves in some way.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.290
Not that they dropped
all the sophistication

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:06.570
that came from the
background that they had.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:08.730
Being multicultural and multilingual

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:12.063
certainly helps you as a
historian to write history books.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:14.760
But they're keeping that

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.920
and they're saying history is really about

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.590
the people who are in this one language.

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:23.163
So that leads us to a debate.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.040
That's a position, that's a debate.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:30.780
And on the other side of
this debate is a character,

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.730
Okay, I really should have made
a sheet for today, I guess.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:42.660
Is a character called
Viacheslav Lypyn'skyi.

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.120
And Lypyn'skyi says basically,

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:48.450
hey, Hrushevs'kyi, look at Ukraine.

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:51.450
The cities are full of Russian speakers,

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:54.548
lots of Jews, lots of Polish nobles.

00:37:54.548 --> 00:37:58.170
How are you gonna make
your state out of that?

00:37:58.170 --> 00:37:59.520
You're not just gonna be able to say

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.150
the Ukrainian people, the
masses and the peasants.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:06.150
You need this very commonsensical point.

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:10.290
We need the cities and
we need the taxpayers

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:11.730
and those traditional historical,

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:13.650
going back to these traditional stories,

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:15.690
the people who are from
the traditional stories,

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:17.010
what are we gonna do with them?

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:18.930
Are we just gonna eliminate them?

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:21.570
Or maybe we should give
them a different role.

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:26.130
So Lypyn'skyi answers
Hrushevs'kyi by saying fine,

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.230
the people are coming into politics,

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:30.600
but if we're going to have a nation,

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:34.350
the nation itself is going to have to be

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:37.590
politically savvy enough to say, okay,

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:39.300
there's a place for the Polish nobility.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.920
Maybe they don't get to
own the land anymore,

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.731
but they get something.

00:38:42.731 --> 00:38:45.570
There has to be a place for the Jews.

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:46.770
There has to be a place for the people

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:47.760
who used to own the land.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.833
We can't just imagine them away.

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:54.450
It's beautiful to say that
the essence of the nation

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:57.060
is in the countryside and the
people who tilled the soil

00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.237
and look at the sunset and
the beautiful mounds of hay.

00:39:00.237 --> 00:39:04.170
You've seen the art that
arises from all this.

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:05.880
Look at that beautiful image.

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.310
There's a beautiful woman and
there's her beautiful daughter

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:09.810
and look, they've have a scythe

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:11.460
and that's the nation, right?

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:13.020
It's beautiful, it's very persuasive.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:14.760
But what are you gonna do about

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:15.990
the people who live in the cities?

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:18.430
What do you do about all the other people

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:21.147
and you can't have a
nation without the cities.

00:39:21.147 --> 00:39:24.570
So what do you do? So Lypyn'skyi
has an answer to this.

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:26.490
Lypyn'skyi has an answer.

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:28.110
Lypyn'skyi in his turn, and don't worry,

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:31.293
we're gonna do all this
history many, many times over.

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:37.020
Lypyn'skyi in turn--

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:39.720
Oh, did I mention he was
from a Polish noble family?

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.310
He was from a Polish noble family.

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:45.363
Lypyn'skyi in turn is answered
by a guy called Dontsov.

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:50.389
Now we're getting into the 1920s and 1930s

00:39:50.389 --> 00:39:53.910
and Dontsov is the most
important ideologist

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:57.300
of Ukrainian far right wing politics.

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.980
In fact, fascism.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:03.980
And Dontsov is very much
inspired by the Italians.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.340
Dontsov says no, no, it is
really all about the people

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.320
and the people really
should be homogenous.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.490
And the people really should rebel

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:13.240
against all these other traditions.

00:40:15.834 --> 00:40:16.667
Dontsov...

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.127
I'm gonna let you guess.
Okay, I won't let you guess.

00:40:20.127 --> 00:40:24.150
He had a brother who was a Bolshevik

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:26.850
and that Bolshevik brother
was a Russian, right?

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:28.680
So it's an example of how the people

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.170
who are maybe even the most radical

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:33.060
on the ethnic side of things,

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:35.070
they're not coming from the ethnicity.

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:36.930
They're choosing something,

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:39.540
at the beginning you have to choose.

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:40.373
Because at the beginning,

00:40:40.373 --> 00:40:42.300
the nation is still coming into being,

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:43.413
so you have to choose.

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:47.310
So Dontsov is answering Lypyn'skyi.

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:49.180
These guys are enemies

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:58.260
and the Dontsov tradition of
what we call ethnic nationalism

00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.760
is important.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.640
It matters in Ukrainian political life.

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.430
And it matters in Ukrainian diaspora,

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:07.713
it continues in North America.

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:13.780
But Dontsov in turn was answered

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:20.820
by this guy that we're
supposed to be reading.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.410
Now, I'm aware that his book turns out

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:23.430
not to be in the bookstore.

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:25.890
I put the first essay up online

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:28.590
and we will keep putting
the essays up online.

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:31.620
And we're reading Ivan Rudnyts'kyi

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:35.520
because he is a foundational
political historian of Ukraine

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.000
and he lays out some of the major issues.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000
But in context, Ivan Rudnyts'kyi

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:48.510
is trying to handle this argument

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:50.700
which says that the Ukrainian nation

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.710
is only about people who speak Ukrainian.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:55.710
And that somewhere out there,
at least aspirationally,

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:57.633
there's a homogenous Ukrainian nation.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:00.650
Ivan Rudnyts'kyi is trying to handle that.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:05.460
What he's arguing, and as you read him,

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.600
I want you to read him

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.490
to learn about Ukrainian
history, obviously.

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:10.830
He's good at setting
up the major questions,

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:13.260
but he's also coming into this debate

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.710
about what the nation
actually is supposed to be.

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:18.570
And Ivan Rudnyts'kyi takes the position

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:23.040
that the nation is
fundamentally a political act.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.620
It's fundamentally about
political commitment.

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.423
So modernization matters,

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.273
modernization matters, sure.

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:35.340
The traditional landowning
classes, they matter, sure.

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:36.840
The presence of the Jews matters.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:37.980
This all matters,

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:41.610
but the nation is
fundamentally a political act

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:44.340
directed towards the future.

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:46.950
That doesn't mean it's voluntarist
and you can do anything.

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:48.750
You can't make it up.

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:50.700
You can only act on the
basis of what really is

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.500
and he mostly wrote about the past.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.690
But the nation itself was a political act

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:56.070
directed towards the future,

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:59.508
which means that in principle,
anyone can take part in it.

00:42:59.508 --> 00:43:02.010
Anyone can take part.

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:04.740
So I'm now just gonna say one word

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:08.340
about who Ivan Rudnyts'kyi was.

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:10.290
So, oh, very important.

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:11.940
He wins.

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:16.620
He wins the argument, which
is kind of fascinating.

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.770
If there's any person
who wins the argument,

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:22.200
I mean, maybe in the 22nd
century it will look different,

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.900
but looking at it from the point of 2022,

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:28.060
he wins the argument in North America

00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:32.910
and he also wins the argument in Ukraine.

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:35.550
Although as we'll see, there
are many reasons in Ukraine

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:37.770
why his arguments are
gonna seem plausible.

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:41.580
But he wins the argument about
what Ukraine should be like.

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:45.180
And that in turn has very
important implications

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:47.550
for what Ukraine is like,

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:51.870
because theorizing the nation
is not an abstract action.

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:55.530
It's also about how you form the nation.

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:58.020
So 30 seconds and I'll tell
you who Ivan Rudnyts'kyi is

00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:59.270
and we'll return to that.

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:02.913
So Ivan Rudnyts'kyi was
Halachically Jewish.

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:08.780
His grandmother was born Ida Spiegel

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.090
in the Habsburg monarchy.

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:17.090
She married a Ukrainian
and they had five children.

00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:22.110
He died early, the husband,

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:26.070
and Ida Spiegel, who was
alienated from her family

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:29.850
and took the name Olga, raised
the children to be Ukrainian.

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:32.570
The common language in the family was...

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:35.330
Anybody wanna take a shot at that?

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:37.623
Common language?

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.060
We're in the Habsburg monarchy.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.600
Not bad.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.000
We're in Galicia in the Habsburg monarchy.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.470
- Polish?
- Polish.

00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:52.140
Polish, Polish. Common language between--

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:54.030
I mean, her mother tongue was Yiddish

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:56.370
and his mother tongue was Ukrainian.

00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:58.620
Although he had Polish grandparents,

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:00.990
but their language between
themselves was Polish.

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:03.690
The kids' best language for
a long time was also Polish.

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:08.253
So there were five kids
with this Jewish mother.

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.880
All five of them became
very important figures

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.190
in Ukrainian national movement,
we'll talk about that.

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:17.250
But there was one daughter, Milena.

00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:22.250
Milena was a feminist and a
very prominent parliamentarian

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.000
in the Polish parliament.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.410
She did some extraordinary things

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:27.120
that we'll talk about later on,

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:32.120
but Milena Rudnyts'ka was the
mother of the Ivan Rudnyts'kyi.

00:45:33.018 --> 00:45:38.018
So his mother's mother was
self-identifying Jewish.

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.140
Everybody who's taking part
in these conversations,

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.000
regardless of their position,

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.980
is coming from all over the place.

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:51.090
But there's a conversation
where Rudnyts'kyi

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:52.950
ends up being the most influential figure

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:56.310
and that conversation
shapes not only this class,

00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:58.050
it very much shapes the way

00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:02.190
that Ukrainians are talking
about nationality now.

00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:03.210
I'll leave you with that

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:06.030
and I'll see you again in a week's time,

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:07.440
map quiz on Thursday.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.273
Thanks.

00:46:09.989 --> 00:46:13.322
(upbeat rhythmic chime)

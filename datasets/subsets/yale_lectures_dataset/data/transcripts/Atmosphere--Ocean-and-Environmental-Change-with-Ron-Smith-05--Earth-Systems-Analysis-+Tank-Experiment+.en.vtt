RONALD SMITH: We're going to be
talking

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:08.667
about a simple example
of systems analysis.

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:10.167
I put the term up here.

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:18.100
Almost everything we deal with
in science, engineering, even

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.167
everyday life, has
some elements of

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:24.000
system analysis to it.

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:31.633
The simplest kind of a system,
like the one I have here,

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:37.600
consists of a reservoir, where
you store things, and inputs

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.000
and outputs.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.767
With that definition, I think
you can imagine a wide variety

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:46.500
of things that might
resemble this.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.133
For example, the heat budget of
the Earth, which we'll be

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:56.700
speaking about next week, you
can store heat in the Earth's

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.100
solid parts and the
atmosphere.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.733
You can have heat coming from
the Sun, which is the input.

00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:06.600
You can have heat radiating
to space.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.200
And it's the nature of that
systems analysis that will

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.233
help to understand the
climate of the Earth.

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:18.967
If you look at the hydrologic
cycle--

00:01:18.967 --> 00:01:21.433
for example, let's look at
the atmospheric part--

00:01:21.433 --> 00:01:25.167
how much water vapor do you have
stored in the atmosphere?

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:26.567
What are the inputs?

00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:28.200
What are the outputs?

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.900
Only by understanding that way
can we really understand how

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.400
water vapor is handled in
the Earth's atmosphere.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.400
The same thing for lakes.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.600
A lake has a storage
capability.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.233
It has inputs.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:41.967
It has outputs.

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:45.400
The carbon cycle, there's
carbon in the atmosphere

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.500
stored there, inputs
and outputs.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.333
In other words, almost
everything we deal with in

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:54.267
life has some elements of a
simple system like the one

00:01:54.267 --> 00:01:55.233
we're dealing with today.

00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:57.100
So this is meant to be--

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.533
nothing special about it.

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:02.767
It's just an analogue for many
of the things that we'll be

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:05.800
dealing with in this course and
you may run into in other

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.867
circumstances as well.

00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:12.033
So we have to first understand
those three

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:14.700
components, the storage--

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.600
the reservoir itself--

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.600
the input, and the output.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.000
So this is a thin tank
made of Plexiglas.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.333
And the dimensions you will
need, the dimensions are here.

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:34.333
The inside dimensions of that
are 59 centimeters in length,

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:40.633
two centimeters in width, and
25 centimeters in depth.

00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:43.033
So if you need to compute the
volume of this, you can do it

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:47.433
easily from those dimensions.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:50.933
It has a little pipe-- a little
hole in the end at this

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:53.167
end-- you can't see it from
where you're sitting--

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:58.067
a short little pipe, a valve,
and then it flows out into the

00:02:58.067 --> 00:03:00.300
sink and down into the drain.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.400
We'll need to know that that
valve is about six centimeters

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.433
below the bottom of the tank.

00:03:08.433 --> 00:03:12.767
I'll explain why that's
important in just a moment.

00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:17.967
The input is this little
rubber hose right here.

00:03:17.967 --> 00:03:23.000
It's controlled by a faucet, and
I can change the rate at

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
which water is flowing in just
by twisting that valve.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.500
And then the output comes
out the valve.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.667
And that's a controllable valve,
but I'm going to leave

00:03:36.667 --> 00:03:39.967
it set where it is for right
now, and we're going to just

00:03:39.967 --> 00:03:45.800
leave it and deal with it in
the form that it's in.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.967
Any questions yet about this
simple system I have here?

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:57.567
Now, the inputs and the outputs,
we're going to use

00:03:57.567 --> 00:04:00.200
capital Q for this.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.400
It's the volume flow rate.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.567
And it'll have units of
milliliters per second.

00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:10.367
Or if you like, a milliliter
is a cubic centimeter.

00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:14.700
It's a centimeter by a
centimeter by a centimeter.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.567
And the way we're going to
measure that-- and Patrick has

00:04:17.567 --> 00:04:20.133
agreed to help me with this.

00:04:20.133 --> 00:04:25.767
If you can come on up, try that
stopwatch, try starting

00:04:25.767 --> 00:04:30.633
it, stopping it, and then
resetting it over here.

00:04:30.633 --> 00:04:31.533
OK, is that going to work?

00:04:31.533 --> 00:04:36.033
So I'm going to pull
out this pipe.

00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:47.467
This is a 400-milliliter
container,

00:04:47.467 --> 00:04:49.267
400-millilier container.

00:04:49.267 --> 00:04:52.767
So we're going to time how long
it takes to fill that up,

00:04:52.767 --> 00:04:56.567
and then we will just get
the flow rate from that.

00:04:56.567 --> 00:04:59.800
So I will give you
a countdown.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.867
Three, two, one, start.

00:05:02.867 --> 00:05:05.200
And as soon as that reaches the
top there, you can stop.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.867
So the flow rate coming out of
the valve right now is--

00:05:16.867 --> 00:05:20.867
Q is 400 milliliters
divided by--

00:05:20.867 --> 00:05:22.933
STUDENT: 7.41

00:05:22.933 --> 00:05:24.800
PROFESSOR: 7.41.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.300
Can you do that calculation
for me?

00:05:30.533 --> 00:05:34.033
400 by 7.41.

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:36.500
STUDENT: 53.98.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.700
PROFESSOR: 53.98.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.867
And the units on that
are going to be

00:05:40.867 --> 00:05:44.500
milliliters per second.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.167
So we're going to be doing this
over and over again with

00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:48.567
different flow configurations.

00:05:48.567 --> 00:05:51.733
Now, you can sit for
a few minutes.

00:05:51.733 --> 00:05:53.400
It'll take a while now
to get this set.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:01.300
I'm going to try to determine
the nature of the valve.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.200
How easily is the valve letting
water out of the tank?

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.367
That's going to be a critical
part of our understanding of

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:08.400
this system.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:18.067
And I'm going to tell you that
Q Out will take the form of

00:06:18.067 --> 00:06:25.700
some constant times the square
root of Z Effective, where Z

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.500
is the depth of the water.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.400
I think you would expect that
the deeper the water, the more

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.200
pressure there is trying to push
water through the valve,

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:41.300
and so the faster Q Out will be,
the larger Q Out will be.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.100
So we have to determine the--

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.433
well, this constant.

00:06:46.433 --> 00:06:48.667
This constant will depend
on how I have

00:06:48.667 --> 00:06:51.400
that exit valve set.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.500
And if I were to change it,
I'd have to redo the

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.833
calculation of K again.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.367
But I'm going to leave
it like it is.

00:06:58.367 --> 00:07:01.400
We're going to let this come
to a steady state for a

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.533
minute, and then we'll
do a calculation.

00:07:05.533 --> 00:07:07.800
Now, what is Z Effective?

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:13.967
If the water depth is here, we
measure Z as the height from

00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:17.933
the bottom of the tank up to the
water top, and then we add

00:07:17.933 --> 00:07:19.167
six centimeters to it.

00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:26.500
So Z Effective is Z plus
six centimeters.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.733
Because that gives us the depth
all the way to the valve

00:07:29.733 --> 00:07:31.400
itself, and that's what's
going to be

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.500
pushing the water out.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.433
The point is, even when the tank
is empty, if there's a

00:07:36.433 --> 00:07:40.000
little bit of water in that
pipe, that vertical pipe,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.433
you're still going to be getting
some water running out

00:07:42.433 --> 00:07:44.833
until all the water in
the pipe is gone.

00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:47.400
And then of course, Z Effective
would be zero, and

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.733
then of course Q Out
would be zero.

00:07:50.733 --> 00:07:51.867
So we're going to
determine this.

00:07:51.867 --> 00:07:52.567
How are we going to do it?

00:07:52.567 --> 00:07:56.400
We're going to simply solve this
for K. So it's going to

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.800
be Q Out divided by the square
root of Z Effective.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.367
So let's do, Patrick, let's do
this calculation again now.

00:08:13.133 --> 00:08:15.667
Let's do the Q Out first.
Are you ready?

00:08:15.667 --> 00:08:17.000
Are you set?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.567
One, two, three, start.

00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:38.300
STUDENT: 8.37.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.167
PROFESSOR: So what is Q Out?

00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:42.700
You do the--

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.933
you do that.

00:08:47.733 --> 00:08:50.133
STUDENT: 47.79.

00:08:50.133 --> 00:08:52.267
PROFESSOR: 47.79.

00:08:52.267 --> 00:08:55.600
Could you now measure the depth
of this, please, in

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.533
centimeters.

00:08:56.533 --> 00:08:59.967
Come around and measure it from
the top of the plastic

00:08:59.967 --> 00:09:01.633
there-- not from the
table, but from

00:09:01.633 --> 00:09:02.967
the top of the plastic--

00:09:02.967 --> 00:09:04.200
and get the depth.

00:09:07.633 --> 00:09:10.100
STUDENT: It's about
10 centimeters.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.000
PROFESSOR: 10 centimeters.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.833
So that means Z Effective
is going to be 16.

00:09:16.833 --> 00:09:19.367
So if you could do one more
calculation for me, then.

00:09:19.367 --> 00:09:27.067
I need to get 47.79 divided
by the square root of 16.

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:28.100
Well, that's easy, isn't it?

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.733
The square root of 16
is four, so it's--

00:09:31.733 --> 00:09:33.767
STUDENT: 11.95.

00:09:33.767 --> 00:09:39.333
PROFESSOR: 11.95.

00:09:39.333 --> 00:09:40.533
So the valve constant K--
thanks, we're done.

00:09:40.533 --> 00:09:42.700
So the valve constant K
for that particular

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:47.900
valve setting is 11.95.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.633
The units on that are weird.

00:09:49.633 --> 00:09:52.133
You'd have to work out the units
from the flow rate here

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:55.167
and the fact that the Z is
inside a square root sign, but

00:09:55.167 --> 00:09:58.367
we'll just leave it as
a number without

00:09:58.367 --> 00:09:59.767
the units on it.

00:09:59.767 --> 00:10:05.067
So we've characterized
the inflow

00:10:05.067 --> 00:10:07.700
controlled by my faucet.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.633
We've characterized the
reservoir, characterized by

00:10:11.633 --> 00:10:13.533
its dimensions.

00:10:13.533 --> 00:10:19.167
And we've characterized the
outflow by finding this valve

00:10:19.167 --> 00:10:22.933
constant K. So now we know for
any fluid depth, we can

00:10:22.933 --> 00:10:29.100
compute what the outflow
will be.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.100
So we're off to a good start.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:38.700
Now, we have to do a little bit
of calculation to protect

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.800
against disaster here.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:50.367
So let's try to compute from
these formulas what flow

00:10:50.367 --> 00:10:53.433
rate--what's the maximum flow
rate I could use before the

00:10:53.433 --> 00:10:54.700
tank would overflow?

00:10:56.967 --> 00:10:58.433
So let's see.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.033
We're going to use--we're
going to assume a steady

00:11:03.033 --> 00:11:14.000
state, in which case Q
In will equal Q Out.

00:11:17.533 --> 00:11:22.300
And so I'm going to specify
some particular Q In.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.867
And then the Q Out is going to
be given by this, the valve

00:11:25.867 --> 00:11:30.767
constant times the square
root of Z Effective.

00:11:30.767 --> 00:11:34.067
Now, what's the maximum value
Z Effective could be?

00:11:34.067 --> 00:11:39.267
It's the depth of the tank, 25
centimeters, plus the six

00:11:39.267 --> 00:11:40.900
centimeters to get down
to the valve.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:47.467
So this is going to be K times
the square root of 31, if I've

00:11:47.467 --> 00:11:49.567
done that calculation
correctly.

00:11:49.567 --> 00:11:52.533
And could you do that
for me, Patrick?

00:11:52.533 --> 00:11:53.833
What's that?

00:11:53.833 --> 00:12:04.133
Use the valve constant here
and then times the

00:12:04.133 --> 00:12:10.300
square root of 31.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.200
STUDENT: 66.53.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:18.000
PROFESSOR: 66.53.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.767
So we're going to have to watch
out for that number.

00:12:19.767 --> 00:12:21.167
We're not going to want
to put more water in

00:12:21.167 --> 00:12:23.567
there than that value.

00:12:23.567 --> 00:12:25.900
That's in milliliters
per second.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:30.033
We predict a faster flow rate
than that would make the whole

00:12:30.033 --> 00:12:31.867
system overflow.

00:12:31.867 --> 00:12:36.467
So now let's see if we can
predict the level that the

00:12:36.467 --> 00:12:42.900
water will come to when I change
the input flow rate.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.700
So let's--

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.067
I'll take this out of here.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.667
Let's see.

00:12:50.667 --> 00:12:51.900
I'll decrease it a little bit.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.767
We'll do a measurement,
Patrick, on the

00:12:54.767 --> 00:12:57.800
new flow rate here.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.933
You ready?

00:12:58.933 --> 00:13:01.133
One, two, three, start.

00:13:22.233 --> 00:13:23.200
What's the time on it?

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:23.933
STUDENT: 10.75.

00:13:23.933 --> 00:13:24.800
PROFESSOR: Say again?

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.700
STUDENT: 10.75.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.333
PROFESSOR: 10.75.

00:13:28.333 --> 00:13:29.567
What's that flow rate?

00:13:33.333 --> 00:13:35.800
STUDENT: 37.21.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.867
PROFESSOR: 37.21.

00:13:37.867 --> 00:13:40.667
So here's a proposal.

00:13:40.667 --> 00:13:45.900
If I stick that flow back in
the tank, what water depth

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.400
will we get when it reaches
a steady state?

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.800
Let's do the calculation first.
Well, no, I guess we

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.333
can plug it in there
and get it running.

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:57.633
It'll take a while for
this to work out.

00:13:57.633 --> 00:13:59.400
So let's do the calculation.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.800
We're going to now solve
for Z Effective.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.967
So again using the steady state
assumption, I'm going to

00:14:06.967 --> 00:14:20.033
say Z Effective will be
Q In over K squared.

00:14:20.033 --> 00:14:23.033
Is that right?

00:14:23.033 --> 00:14:26.500
Yeah, I've just taken this and
solved for Z Effective.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:36.800
So that's going to be
37.21 over 11.95.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.467
And we will square that and
see what we get for our

00:14:40.467 --> 00:14:42.100
prediction for the
water depth.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.600
Can you do that for me?

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.500
STUDENT: 9.70.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:09.633
PROFESSOR: 9.70 centimeters.

00:15:09.633 --> 00:15:11.800
Well, now, that doesn't look
like it's going to work out

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.967
too well, does it?

00:15:13.967 --> 00:15:15.200
Let's do a quick measurement
here.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.667
I'll do it.

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:20.667
Has that reached
a steady state?

00:15:20.667 --> 00:15:21.900
Yeah.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.100
Right now, we've got three
centimeters in there, so our

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.767
prediction looks pretty
poor at this stage.

00:15:37.767 --> 00:15:38.367
Oh, wait.

00:15:38.367 --> 00:15:39.633
That was Z Effective.

00:15:41.667 --> 00:15:45.500
So Z we predict would be six
centimeters less than that, so

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.633
that would be 3.7.

00:15:47.633 --> 00:15:50.900
My Z Measured was three.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.633
That's a pretty good prediction,
actually.

00:15:52.633 --> 00:15:55.267
I forgot about that offset.

00:15:55.267 --> 00:15:57.667
Well, let's do it one more
time just to be sure this

00:15:57.667 --> 00:15:58.767
system works.

00:15:58.767 --> 00:16:01.033
I'm going to crank up the flow
rate a little bit, and we're

00:16:01.033 --> 00:16:02.800
going to repeat the
experiment.

00:16:09.233 --> 00:16:10.467
One, two, three.

00:16:25.467 --> 00:16:28.433
STUDENT: 6.06.

00:16:28.433 --> 00:16:29.900
PROFESSOR: And what's that for
a flow rate?

00:16:33.467 --> 00:16:35.333
STUDENT: 66.0.

00:16:35.333 --> 00:16:42.733
PROFESSOR: 66.0.

00:16:42.733 --> 00:16:46.000
I remind you of our warning.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.133
Well, let's give it
a try, shall we?

00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:52.067
It looks like that's right
on the margin of

00:16:52.067 --> 00:16:53.067
what's going to happen.

00:16:53.067 --> 00:16:58.567
So we will take a look and see
what happens with this 66.

00:16:58.567 --> 00:17:01.333
The units again on this are
milliliters per second.

00:17:09.533 --> 00:17:12.833
While we're doing this, we might
talk about a few other

00:17:12.833 --> 00:17:14.067
elements of the problem.

00:17:16.867 --> 00:17:18.233
Let's see.

00:17:18.233 --> 00:17:24.867
Would anything up here change
if I made this tank wider?

00:17:24.867 --> 00:17:28.100
What if this tank, instead of
being two centimeters wide,

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.267
were 10 or 20 or 30
centimeters wide?

00:17:34.467 --> 00:17:40.567
Would, let's see, would this
calculation for the maximum

00:17:40.567 --> 00:17:43.200
possible flow rate change?

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.333
It's a wider tank.

00:17:44.333 --> 00:17:45.933
The reservoir is much larger.

00:17:45.933 --> 00:17:47.933
It can hold a lot more water.

00:17:47.933 --> 00:17:51.733
Would that still be the maximum
flow rate the system

00:17:51.733 --> 00:17:54.633
could handle, or would
it change?

00:17:54.633 --> 00:17:55.900
Any thoughts on that?

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.433
What do you think?

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:03.933
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:11.133 --> 00:18:14.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
nothing would change.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.700
However, it would take a
lot longer to reach the

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.200
equilibrium state.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.067
If you get the water up to a new
depth or to drain it down

00:18:24.067 --> 00:18:26.700
to a new depth, it would take--
instead of just a few

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.533
minutes, it could take maybe 20
or 30 minutes if that tank

00:18:30.533 --> 00:18:32.233
were wider.

00:18:32.233 --> 00:18:35.533
But in terms of the equilibrium
states, for this

00:18:35.533 --> 00:18:39.167
particular system, it is
independent of this depth.

00:18:39.167 --> 00:18:43.133
Remember, the pressure that is
pushing water out the bottom

00:18:43.133 --> 00:18:46.133
depends on the depth only.

00:18:46.133 --> 00:18:48.267
It doesn't depend on how
wide the tank is.

00:18:48.267 --> 00:18:50.600
That's the key.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:56.400
This formula here does not need
to take into account the

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.400
horizontal dimensions
of the box.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.933
So the equilibrium states would
be-- now, that's a very

00:19:05.933 --> 00:19:09.067
interesting result and something
that would be

00:19:09.067 --> 00:19:12.567
interesting to understand in
all the other contexts that

00:19:12.567 --> 00:19:15.733
we'll approach in this course,
like the water budget, the

00:19:15.733 --> 00:19:17.900
heat budget, the CO2 budget.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:21.900
What is the role of the size
of the reservoir on the

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:29.300
equilibrium states and/or the
rate at which you approach the

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.200
equilibrium states?

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.000
In this case, the width does not
influence the equilibrium

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.767
states, but it does influence
the rate at which you approach

00:19:38.767 --> 00:19:41.500
an equilibrium state.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.467
Now, it looks like we've
almost reached

00:19:44.467 --> 00:19:45.700
an equilibrium there.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.567
And I wonder--it doesn't look
like we're in danger of

00:19:49.567 --> 00:19:50.500
overflowing.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.633
So let's do a quick test
to see if maybe

00:19:52.633 --> 00:19:54.833
the flow rate changed.

00:19:54.833 --> 00:19:57.233
Now remember, there are errors
in this calculation,

00:19:57.233 --> 00:19:58.167
everything we're doing.

00:19:58.167 --> 00:20:05.200
For example, there's a potential
error in this valve

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.333
constant, K. If that's off by
a few percent-- we just did

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:10.567
one test. We didn't do
a lot of tests and

00:20:10.567 --> 00:20:11.500
find the best value.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.100
We just did one quick test.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.933
So when I see something that
doesn't quite make sense like

00:20:15.933 --> 00:20:18.100
this, I'm wondering, well, maybe
there's an error in the

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.033
valve constant.

00:20:19.033 --> 00:20:21.800
But maybe also there's been
some change in the rate at

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.567
which we're putting water in.

00:20:23.567 --> 00:20:27.100
So, Patrick, let's just
check that flow rate.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.367
In fact, let's do
it off the exit.

00:20:29.367 --> 00:20:31.933
We'll do it off the exit.

00:20:31.933 --> 00:20:33.400
One, two, three.

00:20:45.133 --> 00:20:48.467
STUDENT: 6.34.

00:20:48.467 --> 00:20:49.733
PROFESSOR: And what's that?

00:20:52.733 --> 00:20:54.633
STUDENT: 63.10.

00:20:54.633 --> 00:20:56.800
PROFESSOR: So that's a
little bit less than

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.333
we thought.

00:20:58.333 --> 00:21:00.900
Maybe the system's not quite
in steady state.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.267
Maybe it's still filling.

00:21:02.267 --> 00:21:05.600
Or maybe the line pressure in
the building has changed

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.533
slightly, and there's a
little bit less water

00:21:07.533 --> 00:21:08.467
coming into the system.

00:21:08.467 --> 00:21:10.067
But it is pretty high.

00:21:10.067 --> 00:21:12.733
It may still be rising slowly.

00:21:12.733 --> 00:21:17.033
And so I think we're not too far
off in our estimate that a

00:21:17.033 --> 00:21:20.733
66 milliliter per second thing
would bring it pretty much to

00:21:20.733 --> 00:21:23.300
the top of the tank.

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:27.200
So I think I'd call that a
success, even though we

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.867
haven't quite proven that
it's going to come right

00:21:28.867 --> 00:21:31.100
up to the very top.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:34.133
I'm going to talk about a few
other aspects of this.

00:21:34.133 --> 00:21:36.200
But before I do that, I want to
see if you have questions

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.000
on how this system works.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
We've looked at it from several
points of view.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.200
There must be something, some
part of it, you didn't fully

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.400
grasp when I went through it.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.100
So let's have some questions
about what's

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.933
really going on here.

00:21:54.333 --> 00:21:55.600
Anything?

00:21:59.267 --> 00:22:00.167
STUDENT: I have a question.

00:22:00.167 --> 00:22:01.533
PROFESSOR: Yeah, question.

00:22:01.533 --> 00:22:03.333
STUDENT: What, exactly,
is K, again?

00:22:03.333 --> 00:22:05.667
PROFESSOR: The
question is what is K?

00:22:05.667 --> 00:22:07.300
I'm calling it the
valve constant.

00:22:10.167 --> 00:22:11.400
I've got an exit valve here.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:16.733
Let me lift it up and show it
to you, if I can do this.

00:22:16.733 --> 00:22:19.733
You see that valve there?

00:22:19.733 --> 00:22:20.300
Uh-oh.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.467
Sprung a leak.

00:22:21.467 --> 00:22:23.767
Sorry about that.

00:22:23.767 --> 00:22:25.300
I got you down there,
didn't I?

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.767
It's always a danger to sit
in front like that.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.133
So there's a valve there that
I could adjust by hand.

00:22:32.133 --> 00:22:37.467
And if I close that valve down,
K would be smaller.

00:22:37.467 --> 00:22:39.733
If I open it up more,
K would be larger.

00:22:39.733 --> 00:22:42.900
It has to do with the area
of the pipe that's

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.167
closed off by the valve.

00:22:45.167 --> 00:22:52.033
I can derive this formula, by
the way, from Bernoulli's Law.

00:22:52.033 --> 00:22:55.400
You may have heard of
Bernoulli's Law.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:59.933
It relates pressure and velocity
in moving fluids.

00:22:59.933 --> 00:23:03.233
And here I can compute the
pressure by knowing the depth

00:23:03.233 --> 00:23:05.133
of the water.

00:23:05.133 --> 00:23:07.567
And then knowing something about
the velocity and the

00:23:07.567 --> 00:23:10.467
area of the valve, I can
compute the flow rate.

00:23:10.467 --> 00:23:12.200
So this formula can
be derived.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.733
But without knowing the area,
without going in there with a

00:23:14.733 --> 00:23:17.967
microscope and measuring how
much area is open in that

00:23:17.967 --> 00:23:21.767
valve, I have to treat K as
an empirical constant.

00:23:21.767 --> 00:23:24.167
I have to determine
it experimentally,

00:23:24.167 --> 00:23:25.400
which is what we did.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.233
Other questions?

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.900
So let's see.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.033
The formula's on the
board there.

00:23:39.033 --> 00:23:41.567
Let's try to think about what
some of the analogies might be

00:23:41.567 --> 00:23:42.800
with this system then.

00:23:45.933 --> 00:23:48.633
The most obvious one
is with a lake.

00:23:48.633 --> 00:23:54.467
If you have rainfall coming into
rivers that's providing a

00:23:54.467 --> 00:23:58.733
certain amount of input, where
the lake exits into a river,

00:23:58.733 --> 00:24:02.200
there's probably some
kind of a control.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.067
Maybe it's a low dam, maybe it's
just rocks in the stream,

00:24:05.067 --> 00:24:08.300
but the outflow is going to be
controlled by the depth of the

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:11.367
water, typically, in a lake.

00:24:11.367 --> 00:24:13.967
Therefore, it'll reach an
equilibrium state very much

00:24:13.967 --> 00:24:15.000
the way this one does.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.100
The exit law will be a
little bit different.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.300
It won't be this formula
exactly.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.967
But there'll be some
relationship between the depth

00:24:21.967 --> 00:24:25.367
of the water and the rate
at which water leaves.

00:24:25.367 --> 00:24:28.800
Then equilibrium will be
very much analogous to

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.633
what we have here.

00:24:29.633 --> 00:24:31.133
What about the transience?

00:24:31.133 --> 00:24:36.467
Well, if you get a drought, that
would be equivalent to

00:24:36.467 --> 00:24:42.833
closing this valve down a little
bit, and the water will

00:24:42.833 --> 00:24:45.833
continue to exit from
the lake, but the

00:24:45.833 --> 00:24:48.267
lake level will drop.

00:24:48.267 --> 00:24:51.033
There's still water going in,
but it's not enough to support

00:24:51.033 --> 00:24:54.033
the rate at which the water
is flowing out.

00:24:54.033 --> 00:24:57.333
You might reach a new
equilibrium, or depending how

00:24:57.333 --> 00:25:01.533
much I've closed that, this
might actually come right down

00:25:01.533 --> 00:25:02.800
to the bottom.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.667
We'll watch and see what
happens with that.

00:25:05.667 --> 00:25:06.633
What's another analogy?

00:25:06.633 --> 00:25:09.533
How about water vapor
in the atmosphere?

00:25:09.533 --> 00:25:10.833
Now, it's not a liquid
anymore.

00:25:10.833 --> 00:25:12.633
It's a vapor.

00:25:12.633 --> 00:25:20.733
The input would be evaporation
from lakes and from trees.

00:25:20.733 --> 00:25:21.967
The output would be rain.

00:25:21.967 --> 00:25:26.967
Now, the rain, which forms in
clouds and falls to the Earth,

00:25:26.967 --> 00:25:29.200
probably the rain rate is
going to be proportional

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.700
roughly to how much water
vapor you have.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:36.467
So the loss of water vapor from
the atmosphere is going

00:25:36.467 --> 00:25:37.767
to work a little bit
like this too.

00:25:37.767 --> 00:25:39.800
You're going to have a constant
input, which is going

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.600
to be the evaporation, and then
as the humidity in the

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.900
atmosphere approaches 100% and
you begin to form clouds with

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:52.633
precipitation, that Q Out is
going to increase, and you're

00:25:52.633 --> 00:25:54.800
going to reach a steady state.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.967
And that's what we have most
of the time in the Earth's

00:25:56.967 --> 00:26:00.100
atmosphere there's a
kind of a balance--

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.367
yeah, that one almost
bottomed out--

00:26:04.333 --> 00:26:06.967
kind of a balance between
inputs and outputs.

00:26:06.967 --> 00:26:11.933
Let's think about the heat
budget of the Earth.

00:26:11.933 --> 00:26:16.800
So this is perhaps more
difficult to imagine, but let

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:20.500
the amount of water in that tank
represent the amount of

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:24.067
heat stored in the atmosphere
and the ocean.

00:26:27.067 --> 00:26:30.200
It's getting heat
from the Sun.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.567
The Earth is losing heat by
radiating it to space.

00:26:36.067 --> 00:26:38.433
The hotter--of course, the
amount of heat that the Earth

00:26:38.433 --> 00:26:42.167
is receiving is not particularly
sensitive to its

00:26:42.167 --> 00:26:43.233
own temperature.

00:26:43.233 --> 00:26:45.833
That's just how hot
is the Sun?

00:26:45.833 --> 00:26:47.867
How far is the Sun
from the Earth?

00:26:47.867 --> 00:26:49.500
How much of the Sun's radiation

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.567
reflects off the Earth?

00:26:51.567 --> 00:26:54.533
Let's say that's a given.

00:26:54.533 --> 00:26:58.433
Then the temperature of the
Earth is going to determine,

00:26:58.433 --> 00:27:01.033
though, how much radiates
to space.

00:27:01.033 --> 00:27:05.267
The hotter the Earth is, the
faster will be the rate at

00:27:05.267 --> 00:27:07.367
which energy is lost to space.

00:27:07.367 --> 00:27:11.267
So again, it's analogous
to this.

00:27:11.267 --> 00:27:13.100
You're going to reach
an equilibrium.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:17.800
The temperature of the Earth
is going to rise until the

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:21.867
rate of energy lost to space
matches the rate of energy

00:27:21.867 --> 00:27:23.100
gained from the Sun.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.533
Then you'll have an equilibrium

00:27:24.533 --> 00:27:26.467
temperature for the Earth.

00:27:26.467 --> 00:27:29.933
And if the Sun were to increase
its temperature--

00:27:29.933 --> 00:27:32.100
let's say that's the temperature
of the Earth--

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:37.667
if the Sun were to increase its
temperature or for some

00:27:37.667 --> 00:27:39.933
other reason we were adding
more heat to the Earth's

00:27:39.933 --> 00:27:45.567
system, suddenly, we'd go
into a transient stage.

00:27:45.567 --> 00:27:47.733
You wouldn't come to a new
equilibrium right away.

00:27:47.733 --> 00:27:50.033
There would be a transient stage
where the temperature

00:27:50.033 --> 00:27:53.367
builds up to a new value,
where once again an

00:27:53.367 --> 00:27:57.833
equilibrium can be sustained.

00:27:57.833 --> 00:27:59.067
And we'll see that here.

00:27:59.067 --> 00:28:04.267
Every time I change this input
valve setting, we go through a

00:28:04.267 --> 00:28:06.800
transient stage and
then approach to

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:07.767
a new steady state.

00:28:07.767 --> 00:28:12.467
So that's the way climate works
on the Earth, as well.

00:28:12.467 --> 00:28:13.267
Questions on that one?

00:28:13.267 --> 00:28:13.567
Yes.

00:28:13.567 --> 00:28:14.800
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:24.433 --> 00:28:25.333
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:28:25.333 --> 00:28:26.667
Let's do that calculation.

00:28:26.667 --> 00:28:30.000
The question is whether we can
compute the flow rate that

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.733
would bring it to zero.

00:28:31.733 --> 00:28:34.600
Now, by zero, we mean empty the
tank, but there'd still be

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.500
some water in the little pipe
down at the bottom.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.167
So Q--

00:28:40.167 --> 00:28:48.300
to minimize or to empty the
tank, let's say, Q In to empty

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:57.033
the tank would be K times the
square root of the minimum

00:28:57.033 --> 00:28:59.033
value of Z Effective.

00:28:59.033 --> 00:29:03.000
When the tank is empty, Z is
zero, so Z Effective is six.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.667
So I'll put six centimeters
in there.

00:29:05.667 --> 00:29:09.100
And, Patrick, could you do
that calculation for me?

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:13.667
It's the valve constant, 11.9,
times the square root of six.

00:29:22.867 --> 00:29:22.967
STUDENT: 29.15.

00:29:22.967 --> 00:29:24.233
STUDENT: What is the K value?

00:29:33.233 --> 00:29:35.267
PROFESSOR: Right there.

00:29:35.267 --> 00:29:37.200
So that's a good question.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.300
Now, whether that has any
analogue in these other

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.200
systems I'm talking about,
I'm not so sure.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.100
For example, what
would it mean--

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:48.433
well, of course, a lake
could empty out.

00:29:48.433 --> 00:29:50.500
We can imagine that.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:55.433
Could we imagine the Earth
storing no heat?

00:29:55.433 --> 00:29:55.900
Not really.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.233
It'd have to be at
absolute zero.

00:29:58.233 --> 00:30:02.167
So I don't think that minimum
could be carried over to find

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:04.433
an analogy in the Earth's
heat budget.

00:30:04.433 --> 00:30:06.333
Probably not the maximum,
either.

00:30:06.333 --> 00:30:09.800
I mean, there's no such thing
as overflowing the Earth's

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.233
heat budget.

00:30:11.233 --> 00:30:12.067
Where's the heat going to go?

00:30:12.067 --> 00:30:13.767
It's going to have
to escape again.

00:30:13.767 --> 00:30:17.100
So not everything here has an
analogue with every system

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.433
that we're talking about, but
the basic elements of how an

00:30:19.433 --> 00:30:23.367
equilibrium is reached, I think
that's the one that

00:30:23.367 --> 00:30:25.500
carries over fairly
dramatically.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:30.900
So let's imagine what would
determine for the Earth's heat

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:36.800
budget, what would determine the
rate of approach to a new

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.133
equilibrium?

00:30:39.133 --> 00:30:42.133
I think in this case it would be
probably the heat capacity

00:30:42.133 --> 00:30:44.000
of the Earth.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.400
How much heat can you store?

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.533
And so we'd have to do a
calculation taking into

00:30:48.533 --> 00:30:52.533
account the thermal heat
capacity of the oceans, the

00:30:52.533 --> 00:30:56.867
thermal heat capacity of the
land surface, and that would

00:30:56.867 --> 00:30:59.767
determine the rate at which
you'd approach the new

00:30:59.767 --> 00:31:00.500
equilibrium.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.167
Those things would not enter
into what the new equilibrium

00:31:03.167 --> 00:31:08.100
state would be, but those would
enter into the rate at

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.267
which you reach that
new equilibrium.

00:31:11.267 --> 00:31:12.567
So these nuances--

00:31:12.567 --> 00:31:15.000
I call them nuances-- they're
actually of central

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
importance.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.800
The difference between the
nature of the steady state and

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.433
the nature of the transient
state is quite important in

00:31:22.433 --> 00:31:22.700
all of

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.100
these systems. Yes.

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.333
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:37.167 --> 00:31:38.567
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:31:38.567 --> 00:31:41.467
The question is is there
analogue in the systems I

00:31:41.467 --> 00:31:43.400
mentioned to the out valve?

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.400
And yeah, I think there would
be one, and it's one that I

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.100
should've thought about
to mention.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:32:07.633
If we're talking about the heat
budget analogue, the heat

00:32:07.633 --> 00:32:13.200
budget analogue is the Earth
receiving heat from the Sun,

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.633
storing some of it, and then
radiating it to space.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.633
If I add-- if I have an
atmosphere with a greenhouse

00:32:23.633 --> 00:32:28.000
gas and I add more greenhouse
gas, then for the same

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
temperature, it's harder to
get the radiation out.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.533
So adding a greenhouse gas like
CO2 is essentially like

00:32:37.533 --> 00:32:40.633
closing down this valve
a little bit.

00:32:40.633 --> 00:32:41.433
So let me try that.

00:32:41.433 --> 00:32:43.500
We'll do a little greenhouse
experiment here.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.467
We'll pretend that this is an
analogue to the surface heat

00:32:46.467 --> 00:32:48.733
budget of our planet.

00:32:48.733 --> 00:32:52.433
And I'm going to add more
absorbing gas to the

00:32:52.433 --> 00:32:55.900
atmosphere so that as the planet
tries to radiate, it

00:32:55.900 --> 00:33:00.700
can't get that radiation out
because of the greenhouse gas.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:02.400
So I'll close this valve down.

00:33:09.833 --> 00:33:12.233
And watch what happens then.

00:33:12.233 --> 00:33:13.400
I haven't changed the input.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.367
Notice, I'm not changing
the Sun.

00:33:15.367 --> 00:33:18.000
I'm not changing what radiation
is coming in, but

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.033
I'm changing the output.

00:33:21.033 --> 00:33:24.067
I'm changing the output law,
so I've just changed K by

00:33:24.067 --> 00:33:26.533
closing that valve down
a little bit.

00:33:26.533 --> 00:33:28.400
So we're out of equilibrium.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.300
We're in a transient stage.

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.833
The climate is out of balance.

00:33:33.833 --> 00:33:40.033
And it looks like I may have
made a tactical error here.

00:33:40.033 --> 00:33:42.033
It looks like I've closed that
valve down too much,

00:33:42.033 --> 00:33:43.200
and we're going to--

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.767
of course, we have a new value
for the maximum now, because

00:33:45.767 --> 00:33:47.133
I've closed the valve.

00:33:47.133 --> 00:33:49.100
It looks like I'm going
to exceed that.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.833
But anyway, that's
the transient.

00:33:50.833 --> 00:33:52.500
I'm going to have to
open this up a bit.

00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:58.900
I put too much greenhouse gas
in the atmosphere there.

00:34:02.233 --> 00:34:03.633
So it reached a new
equilibrium.

00:34:03.633 --> 00:34:05.500
It took a while to do that.

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.133
But we heated up the Earth.

00:34:07.133 --> 00:34:09.600
Now it can get rid of radiation
at the same rate

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:13.867
that it's coming in, and we've
achieved a new balance.

00:34:13.867 --> 00:34:15.733
So maybe that's--

00:34:15.733 --> 00:34:18.767
thanks for that question,
because that provides another

00:34:18.767 --> 00:34:21.900
way to think about the analogy
between this and the Earth and

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:22.167
the heat budget.

00:34:22.167 --> 00:34:25.200
Was there a question
back here?

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:25.700
Yes.

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:26.933
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:30.900
PROFESSOR: No, that's right.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:31.933
That's the remarkable thing.

00:34:31.933 --> 00:34:35.367
So the gases we normally think
of as greenhouse gases, like

00:34:35.367 --> 00:34:39.233
carbon dioxide, methane, and
water vapor, they actually

00:34:39.233 --> 00:34:43.633
don't do very much to the
Sun's radiation at all.

00:34:43.633 --> 00:34:48.367
Those molecules do not absorb
those short wavelengths coming

00:34:48.367 --> 00:34:52.533
from the Sun, but they do absorb
the longer wavelengths

00:34:52.533 --> 00:34:54.133
that the Earth is
radiating at.

00:34:54.133 --> 00:34:56.700
We'll talk about this
in class next week.

00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.767
So this is a pretty good analogy
of that, because

00:34:58.767 --> 00:35:03.433
adding greenhouse gas doesn't
change the input, but it does

00:35:03.433 --> 00:35:05.767
change the output law.

00:35:05.767 --> 00:35:10.500
It changes the relationship
between heat you've stored and

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.933
the rate at which you're
getting rid of heat by

00:35:12.933 --> 00:35:13.933
radiating it to space.

00:35:13.933 --> 00:35:18.900
So it's a pretty good analogy
to the greenhouse effect.

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:19.133
Yeah.

00:35:19.133 --> 00:35:21.967
STUDENT: But so then once it
leaves the equilibrium then,

00:35:21.967 --> 00:35:23.867
you'll still have the
same radiation?

00:35:23.867 --> 00:35:25.200
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:28.833
This radiation leaving will be
equal to this once again, but

00:35:28.833 --> 00:35:30.600
now the Earth will be hotter.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.867
The Earth will have
to be hotter to

00:35:31.867 --> 00:35:33.400
maintain that balance.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.233
That's exactly the point.

00:35:35.233 --> 00:35:35.533
Yes.

00:35:35.533 --> 00:35:38.567
You'll go back to a steady state
again where Q In equals

00:35:38.567 --> 00:35:40.567
Q Out, but in order to do--

00:35:40.567 --> 00:35:45.033
just like here, the new steady
state, Q In equals Q Out, but

00:35:45.033 --> 00:35:47.400
now the water depth
is greater.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.000
There's more heat stored in the
system for this analogue,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.133
and that means the Earth
is a hotter place, a

00:35:53.133 --> 00:35:55.500
hotter place to be.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.733
Other questions on this?

00:35:59.933 --> 00:36:06.533
Well, let me just do one sketch
then to make this

00:36:06.533 --> 00:36:08.833
transient thing a little
bit more clear

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:10.067
before we quit today.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.367
I want to get this
in your notes.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:39.000
Thinking about this tank, if I
plotted versus time Q In and I

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.867
plotted beneath that the depth
of the water in the tank

00:36:41.867 --> 00:36:49.700
versus time, let's say we
established some flow rate,

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.700
and it was in steady state,
and so the water depth was

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:53.933
constant as well.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.533
Let's do a couple little
experiments here.

00:36:59.533 --> 00:37:06.967
If I suddenly increase the
inflow rate, what would happen

00:37:06.967 --> 00:37:09.367
to the water depth?

00:37:09.367 --> 00:37:10.567
Does it jump as well?

00:37:10.567 --> 00:37:11.667
Well, no, we did that
experiment.

00:37:11.667 --> 00:37:14.233
Actually, it begins to
rise immediately.

00:37:14.233 --> 00:37:17.400
There's a kink in the curve, but
not a jump in the curve.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:23.533
So it rises like this and then
ultimately approaches a new

00:37:23.533 --> 00:37:24.767
steady state.

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:37.500
And as we've talked about, the
time it takes to come to a new

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:41.133
steady state, the length of this
transient period in this

00:37:41.133 --> 00:37:46.067
case would depend on the
width of the tank.

00:37:46.067 --> 00:37:49.967
If the tank happened to be
twice as wide, say four

00:37:49.967 --> 00:37:54.067
centimeters instead of two
centimeters, this curve would

00:37:54.067 --> 00:37:57.200
look something like this.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.633
It would take about twice
as long to get to

00:38:00.633 --> 00:38:01.900
the new steady state.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:09.000
To make matters even more
complicated, what if I slowly

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:15.000
increased the Q In?

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.367
Well then, this would
be even slower.

00:38:19.367 --> 00:38:24.667
But that's because I've gone
slow on changing the inputs.

00:38:24.667 --> 00:38:29.000
But eventually, sometime after
the new steady state for Q In

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.200
was reached, eventually the
new steady state for the

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.600
system would be reached.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.833
So we're going to want
to understand--

00:38:39.133 --> 00:38:42.167
in the case of global warming
later in the course, we're

00:38:42.167 --> 00:38:45.800
going to want to understand
the rate at which we're

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:50.933
changing the properties of the
system, Q In or Q Out, and the

00:38:50.933 --> 00:38:52.533
nature of the transient
response.

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:57.833
And I think that'll
do it for the day.

00:38:57.833 --> 00:38:58.900
We'll finish a little
bit early, and

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:00.900
I'll see you on Monday.

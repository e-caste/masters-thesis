00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.850
Prof: Good morning
everyone.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.574
Back to Rome today,
back to Rome,

00:00:06.574 --> 00:00:10.660
which was beginning to emerge
as the world's,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.980
or the ancient world's,
greatest superpower,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.883
an emergence that we're going
to see had a profound impact on

00:00:18.883 --> 00:00:20.600
Roman architecture.
 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.517
And we'll also see that there
were a number of men who

00:00:24.517 --> 00:00:27.400
effected this superstardom for
Rome,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.540
and they're men that I'm going
to talk about with you today.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.070
These included Julius Caesar,
Pompey the Great,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.020
Mark Antony,
and Octavian Augustus,

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.660
especially Octavian Augustus:
Augustus,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.337
first emperor of Rome,
and it's the reason that I have

00:00:46.337 --> 00:00:50.015
decided to call this lecture
today "From Brick to

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:52.930
Marble: Augustus Assembles
Rome."

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.907
You see on the left-hand side
of the screen a portrait of

00:00:57.907 --> 00:00:59.330
Julius Caesar.
 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.530
It's a green diabase portrait
of Caesar.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.977
It's now in Berlin,
and I believe actually that it

00:01:05.977 --> 00:01:09.284
is a portrait that was
commissioned by Cleopatra

00:01:09.284 --> 00:01:10.129
herself.
 

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:13.796
She commissioned it for a
building that she and Caesar

00:01:13.796 --> 00:01:18.102
were putting up in Alexandria,
called the Caesareum that

00:01:18.102 --> 00:01:21.403
honored Caesar,
and you can see that he is

00:01:21.403 --> 00:01:24.780
represented as he was--
it's a quite realistic portrait

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.825
with the lines and wrinkles,
with his receding hairline and

00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:31.819
so on accentuated in this
portrait.

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:35.803
On the right hand-side of the
screen we see an image of Pompey

00:01:35.803 --> 00:01:39.656
the Great, a marble portrait
that is now in the Ny Carlsberg

00:01:39.656 --> 00:01:41.550
Glyptotek, in Copenhagen.
 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.721
And a portrait that shows that
Pompey the Great very much

00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:47.610
wanted to ally himself with
Alexander the Great,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.069
because if you look at his very
full head of hair,

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.610
you can see that he wears it in
the center,

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.587
pushed up in a kind of
pompadour, which is a reference

00:01:57.587 --> 00:02:03.879
to the same kind of upsweep that
was worn by Alexander the Great.

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:08.068
I want to give you a little bit
of information about Caesar,

00:02:08.068 --> 00:02:09.480
about his life,
about some of his

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.460
accomplishments,
because these are going to have

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.866
an impact on the architecture,
on our discussion of the

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:18.008
architecture that he
commissioned in Rome.

00:02:18.008 --> 00:02:22.848
We know that Caesar was elected
consul, in 59 B.C.

00:02:22.848 --> 00:02:26.994
He then joined with Pompey the
Great, and with a man by the

00:02:26.994 --> 00:02:30.138
name of Crassus,
to form what is known as the

00:02:30.138 --> 00:02:31.710
First Triumvirate.
 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.864
The result of that First
Triumvirate was in part that

00:02:36.864 --> 00:02:40.729
Caesar received a consulship in
Gaul.

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:45.870
But despite all good
intentions, just a few years

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.008
later, in 54 B.C.,
the Triumvirate fell apart.

00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:56.008
Difficult times were the case
in Rome between 53 and 50 B.C.

00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:59.840
There were food shortages and
riots in the city,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.407
and the Senate was very
concerned that these uprisings

00:03:04.407 --> 00:03:09.150
would lead to a takeover by the
populace of the city.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.889
Pompey took charge.
 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.199
He took control of the Senate
and he restored order,

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:18.438
and his reward for so doing is
that the Senate was willing to

00:03:18.438 --> 00:03:21.759
work with him to try to
overthrow his rival,

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:24.030
that is, Julius Caesar.
 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.720
Crassus, the other member of
the Triumvirate,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.758
had since died.
 

00:03:27.758 --> 00:03:31.758
But Caesar got the upper hand,
at the end of the day,

00:03:31.758 --> 00:03:34.889
and it was Caesar who defeated
Pompey the Great at a very

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.775
famous battle,
the Battle of Pharsalos,

00:03:38.775 --> 00:03:42.199
which took place in 48 B.C.
 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:46.220
After the Battle of Pharsalos
and his defeat by Julius Caesar,

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.620
Pompey fled to Egypt where he
was murdered,

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.889
and in fact the Egyptians slit
Pompey's head,

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.410
put it on a plate and presented
it to Caesar.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.639
Now you'd think Caesar would
have been happy about that.

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.200
He wasn't, because although he
was thrilled to have defeated

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.162
Pompey the Great,
he did not like seeing the head

00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:09.848
of a fellow Roman delivered to
him on a plate.

00:04:09.848 --> 00:04:13.699
Caesar, at that point,
despite his victory,

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:17.259
what was foremost in his mind
was his affair with Cleopatra,

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:21.939
and he stayed in Egypt with
Cleopatra for a period of time.

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:26.189
But in 45 B.C.,
by 45 B.C., he had returned to

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.850
Rome.
 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.019
He was acclaimed Dictator in
that year,

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:35.379
in 45, and after that he
pursued fiscal reforms for Rome,

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:39.387
and also he commissioned a
number of very important public

00:04:39.387 --> 00:04:41.704
works,
and that's where Roman

00:04:41.704 --> 00:04:44.769
architecture obviously comes
into play.

00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:48.836
Despite the fact that he
initiated those reforms and

00:04:48.836 --> 00:04:53.699
built buildings and built up the
city in interesting ways,

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.550
the aristocrats in Rome
considered Caesar a tyrant.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.699
They considered him a tyrant
because they felt that the

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.966
influence of Cleopatra had
rubbed off too much on him and

00:05:03.966 --> 00:05:06.300
his ambitions were too
monarchical,

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.180
and the aristocrats encouraged
his murder.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.778
And he was assassinated,
as all of you know,

00:05:13.778 --> 00:05:17.920
by Cassius and Brutus in the
year 44 B.C.,

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.113
on the Ides of March,
and he was divinized by the

00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:24.303
Senate,
he was made a god by the

00:05:24.303 --> 00:05:27.250
Senate, in the year 42 B.C.
 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.310
In his biography of Julius
Caesar,

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.173
the writer Suetonius,
who was a secretary and a

00:05:34.173 --> 00:05:38.709
biographer to the emperor
Hadrian in the second century

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:42.007
A.D.,
Suetonius wrote a biography of

00:05:42.007 --> 00:05:45.406
the Twelve Caesars,
a very famous biography that

00:05:45.406 --> 00:05:48.882
many of you may know served as
the basis for Robert Graves'

00:05:48.882 --> 00:05:52.805
very well-known Claudius,
which also accentuates again

00:05:52.805 --> 00:05:55.769
the biographies of those first
Twelve Caesars.

00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:58.949
And although Caesar himself was
dictator, not emperor,

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.610
he is the first of the Caesars
who is covered by Suetonius.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.939
And in Suetonius' biography of
Julius Caesar,

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:10.634
he tells us about some of these
major architectural commissions

00:06:10.634 --> 00:06:13.360
that Caesar embarked on in Rome.
 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.363
And it's interesting to read
about these because we'll see

00:06:17.363 --> 00:06:21.790
that all of them seem to have
been the best and the greatest.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.045
And I think one of the
explanations for this is the

00:06:25.045 --> 00:06:28.041
time that Caesar spent in
Alexandria, in Egypt,

00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:29.278
with Cleopatra.
 

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:33.961
She wanted to show him the
sites, and in fact they went on

00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:37.000
a very famous barge trip
together,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.579
down the Nile,
in which she showed him the

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:43.040
pyramids and the sphinxes that
were there to be seen.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.899
And he was extremely impressed
by what he saw in Egypt,

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:48.531
and decided that one of the
most important things that he

00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:50.744
could do,
that he could contribute to

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:54.473
posterity vis-à-vis Rome,
was to make Rome into a city

00:06:54.473 --> 00:06:56.879
that was the equal of
Alexandria,

00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:00.648
that had similar large-scale
buildings and impressive

00:07:00.648 --> 00:07:03.610
monuments,
the way Alexandria did.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.632
So he came back to Rome,
he undertook this major

00:07:06.632 --> 00:07:10.288
building project,
and Suetonius tells us that he

00:07:10.288 --> 00:07:12.151
built--
he wanted to build,

00:07:12.151 --> 00:07:16.235
he started to build a Temple to
Mars that Suetonius describes as

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:18.050
the biggest in the world.
 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.970
Why?
 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.970
To compete with the buildings
of Alexandria.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.120
A vast--not just a theater--a
vast theater.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.649
Greek and Latin public
libraries.

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:29.384
We know, of course,
that the greatest library in

00:07:29.384 --> 00:07:32.641
the ancient world at this
particular time was the Library

00:07:32.641 --> 00:07:33.690
at Alexandria.
 

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.738
So he wanted libraries in Rome
that could compete with the

00:07:37.738 --> 00:07:39.870
great Library of Alexandria.
 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.874
And he was also particularly
interested in engineering

00:07:43.874 --> 00:07:44.629
marvels.
 

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:49.069
He built, or he began to build,
a highway from the Adriatic,

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:51.610
across the Apennines,
to the Tiber,

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.233
and then most famously a canal
cut through the Isthmus of

00:07:56.233 --> 00:07:57.060
Corinth.
 

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.665
That was, in large part,
achieved, and one can still see

00:08:01.665 --> 00:08:06.019
that canal, if one visits
Corinth in Greece today.

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:08.040
So he had vast ambitions.
 

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:13.228
But many of these ambitions
were cut short by his

00:08:13.228 --> 00:08:16.040
assassination in 44 B.C.
 

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.697
He was not able to achieve
architecturally all that he had

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:17.930
hoped.
 

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:23.934
One building that he was able
to complete, or almost complete,

00:08:23.934 --> 00:08:26.100
was a forum in Rome.
 

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.990
The Forum Iulium,
I-u-l-i-u-m,

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:32.980
which is after his family name
Iulius.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:37.046
The Forum Iulium,
or as we usually call it the

00:08:37.046 --> 00:08:42.557
Forum of Julius Caesar in Rome
was a building that he was able

00:08:42.557 --> 00:08:51.134
to begin in the year 52 B.C.,
and then it was inaugurated in

00:08:51.134 --> 00:08:54.360
46 B.C.,
which is a couple of years

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.750
before his assassination.
 

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.235
It wasn't quite finished at the
time of its inauguration and it

00:08:59.235 --> 00:09:02.852
was left to Caesar's follower,
Augustus, first emperor of

00:09:02.852 --> 00:09:06.990
Rome, to actually complete some
of the details of the forum.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.980
But for all intents and
purposes it was done by 46.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:17.500
I show you a Google Earth
aerial view of the Roman Forum,

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.259
as you see it here--we've
looked at this before--

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:21.785
the Roman Forum,
the Colosseum,

00:09:21.785 --> 00:09:23.668
just for you to get your
bearings,

00:09:23.668 --> 00:09:26.548
the Circus Maximus,
the Palatine Hill,

00:09:26.548 --> 00:09:29.815
the Capitoline Hill,
the Victor Emmanuel Monument

00:09:29.815 --> 00:09:32.162
here,
Mussolini's Via dei Fori

00:09:32.162 --> 00:09:35.434
Imperiali here,
the so-called Imperial Fora,

00:09:35.434 --> 00:09:38.735
of which Augustus' forum,
which we're also going to talk

00:09:38.735 --> 00:09:39.788
about today is a part.
 

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:44.500
The Forum of Caesar is very
close to the Roman Forum.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.595
It's located just to the left
here, and above,

00:09:47.595 --> 00:09:50.210
the wedding cake of Victor
Emmanuel.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.327
You see it here,
and you can barely make out the

00:09:53.327 --> 00:09:57.173
three columns that are still
preserved from the temple that

00:09:57.173 --> 00:09:59.428
was located inside this forum.
 

00:09:59.428 --> 00:10:04.500
So you can see it was adjacent
to, and in fact connected to,

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.678
the Roman forum that lay over
here.

00:10:07.678 --> 00:10:11.320
So a forum, and in that forum a
temple,

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.827
a temple to Venus,
Venus Genetrix,

00:10:16.827 --> 00:10:20.851
G-e-n-e-t-r-i-x,
Venus Genetrix,

00:10:20.851 --> 00:10:23.808
who was the divine ancestress
of the Julian family.

00:10:23.808 --> 00:10:27.807
The Julian family traced its
ancestry back to Venus via

00:10:27.807 --> 00:10:29.658
Aeneas, through Aeneas.
 

00:10:29.658 --> 00:10:34.024
So this was the very special
patron goddess of not only

00:10:34.024 --> 00:10:37.418
Caesar himself but of the Julian
family.

00:10:37.418 --> 00:10:40.623
This is a plan of the Forum of
Julius Caesar,

00:10:40.623 --> 00:10:44.918
as it would have looked when
the building was inaugurated in

00:10:44.918 --> 00:10:45.720
46 B.C.
 

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.995
And I think you can see here
that it has two major

00:10:50.995 --> 00:10:57.239
prototypes, models that were
being looked back at when this

00:10:57.239 --> 00:11:00.899
was designed,
beginning in 52.

00:11:00.899 --> 00:11:04.942
You can see that it is based
heavily on earlier Roman forum

00:11:04.942 --> 00:11:09.052
-- Samnite/Roman forum design --
as we saw it in the city of

00:11:09.052 --> 00:11:12.110
Pompeii;
think of the Forum of Pompeii.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.403
But it also was based in part
on a building that we have not

00:11:15.403 --> 00:11:17.750
looked at and which no longer
survives,

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:22.200
but we have information about,
and that is that Caesareum,

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.412
or Caesareum of Julius Caesar,
that he and Cleopatra put up in

00:11:26.412 --> 00:11:27.308
Alexandria.
 

00:11:27.308 --> 00:11:31.052
And we know enough about that
building to know it too was an

00:11:31.052 --> 00:11:34.413
open rectangular space with
colonnades around it and a

00:11:34.413 --> 00:11:36.000
temple as part of it.
 

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.159
So this whole idea of temple in
a rectangular complex.

00:11:39.159 --> 00:11:40.870
We see it in Alexandria.
 

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:44.928
Contemporaneously we see it
earlier in Pompeii at the Forum

00:11:44.928 --> 00:11:45.840
of Pompeii.
 

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.864
So a great open rectangular
space, open to the sky,

00:11:49.864 --> 00:11:52.519
with colonnades on either side.
 

00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:56.326
You can see on this side there
are some additional chambers,

00:11:56.326 --> 00:11:58.971
and based on what those look
like in plan,

00:11:58.971 --> 00:12:01.809
I am sure you can tell me what
they are.

00:12:01.809 --> 00:12:03.048
Does anyone know?
 

00:12:03.048 --> 00:12:07.190
Think back to what we saw in
Pompeii that looked similar to

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.690
this.
 

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.149
What are these here?
 

00:12:09.149 --> 00:12:09.417
What?
 

00:12:09.417 --> 00:12:11.658
Student:
&gt;

00:12:11.658 --> 00:12:15.303
Prof: Storage did you
say, or-- Student:

00:12:15.303 --> 00:12:16.418
 Storage.
 

00:12:16.418 --> 00:12:17.134
Prof: Storage.
 

00:12:17.134 --> 00:12:19.418
Not exactly storage;
shops, tabernae.

00:12:19.418 --> 00:12:22.582
Remember the tabernae
that we saw fronting the houses

00:12:22.582 --> 00:12:23.278
in Pompeii.
 

00:12:23.278 --> 00:12:25.970
These are a series of shops,
or tabernae,

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:30.070
opening off the left colonnade
of the forum,

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.860
and then on one of the short
sides,

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.769
pushed up against the back
wall--in fact,

00:12:35.769 --> 00:12:38.293
in this case,
almost projecting out of the

00:12:38.293 --> 00:12:43.110
forum to a certain extent--
the Temple of Venus Genetrix.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.297
We can see it in plan,
and it dominates the space in

00:12:46.297 --> 00:12:49.610
front of it, just as the
Capitolium did at Pompeii.

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:54.879
We can see the general plan
conforms to early Roman temple

00:12:54.879 --> 00:12:57.890
architecture,
as we've described it,

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:02.000
with its use of the Etruscan
plan and the Greek elevation.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.975
We can see that there is--well
I'll show you this in a moment,

00:13:05.975 --> 00:13:08.649
but take my word--it has a high
podium;

00:13:08.649 --> 00:13:12.131
it has a deep porch;
it has freestanding columns in

00:13:12.131 --> 00:13:12.850
that porch.
 

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.288
It has a façade
orientation,

00:13:15.288 --> 00:13:19.903
although one idiosyncrasy of
this particular temple is that

00:13:19.903 --> 00:13:23.777
the staircase is located,
not just on the front,

00:13:23.777 --> 00:13:27.397
but on the two sides,
but only at the level of the

00:13:27.397 --> 00:13:27.940
podium.
 

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.200
The staircase does not encircle
the building,

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.168
as it would have in a Greek
temple,

00:13:32.168 --> 00:13:36.580
but it goes beyond the front to
the sides of the podium,

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:41.009
to allow access to it that way
as well.

00:13:41.009 --> 00:13:44.232
A single entrance,
because this is the Temple of

00:13:44.232 --> 00:13:46.840
Venus and not the Capitoline
Triad,

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.916
and then columns,
freestanding columns on either

00:13:49.916 --> 00:13:53.490
side,
but a flat back wall very much

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.928
in the Etruscan manner.
 

00:13:55.928 --> 00:13:59.475
So a temple that is very much
in keeping with the other kind

00:13:59.475 --> 00:14:02.600
of temple architecture that we
have seen thus far.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.352
What's significant though again
is that the choice of goddess to

00:14:07.352 --> 00:14:10.090
honor here,
the fact that it is Venus

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.186
Genetrix,
a personal goddess,

00:14:12.186 --> 00:14:14.971
from the point of view of
Julius Caesar:

00:14:14.971 --> 00:14:18.899
someone who was associated
closely with his family,

00:14:18.899 --> 00:14:22.783
with the genesis of his family,
and not with the Roman State as

00:14:22.783 --> 00:14:23.408
a whole.
 

00:14:23.408 --> 00:14:24.970
And that's a very important
distinction,

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:28.101
the difference between putting
up a temple to the Capitoline

00:14:28.101 --> 00:14:30.485
Triad,
a very state-oriented thing to

00:14:30.485 --> 00:14:34.168
do, and putting up a temple to
your own personal goddess.

00:14:34.168 --> 00:14:37.765
It signals a certain change
vis-à-vis the way these

00:14:37.765 --> 00:14:40.288
individuals thought about
themselves,

00:14:40.288 --> 00:14:43.630
and may again have had
something to do with the way

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:47.700
Caesar was perceived in Rome,
and to his eventual demise.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.668
In fact, I should also add that
Caesar,

00:14:49.668 --> 00:14:53.139
because of his relationship
with Cleopatra,

00:14:53.139 --> 00:14:58.071
ended up putting up a statue of
Cleopatra as the Egyptian

00:14:58.071 --> 00:15:01.096
goddess Isis,
in this temple as well,

00:15:01.096 --> 00:15:03.840
standing right next to Venus
Genetrix.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.910
Which was a pretty arrogant and
probably a pretty stupid thing

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:13.981
to do in Republican Rome where
Cleopatra was considered a very

00:15:13.981 --> 00:15:18.065
interesting public figure,
because she did come with him

00:15:18.065 --> 00:15:23.121
to visit Rome at one point,
but was also maligned by many

00:15:23.121 --> 00:15:28.389
among the aristocracy as an
enemy of Rome.

00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:32.006
I'm showing you here a view of
the Forum of Caesar,

00:15:32.006 --> 00:15:35.479
as it looks today,
and you can see the columns on

00:15:35.479 --> 00:15:38.590
the left-hand side,
from the colonnade.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.100
Some of those still stand.
 

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.438
You can see the staircase or
the foundations of the staircase

00:15:44.438 --> 00:15:46.826
and the podium,
tall podium again,

00:15:46.826 --> 00:15:49.428
of the Temple of Venus
Genetrix.

00:15:49.428 --> 00:15:52.059
But you can see that only a
very small number,

00:15:52.059 --> 00:15:54.750
three in fact,
of the columns are preserved.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.830
So it is in actually quite
ruinous state.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:00.129
And what you're looking at here
is actually not even,

00:16:00.129 --> 00:16:03.190
for the most part,
the Julian building,

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.514
because we know that this
building was seriously damaged

00:16:06.514 --> 00:16:09.649
in a fire,
later, and that it was restored

00:16:09.649 --> 00:16:13.368
by the emperor Domitian,
in the late first century A.D.,

00:16:13.368 --> 00:16:16.586
and then by the emperor Trajan,
into the early second century

00:16:16.586 --> 00:16:16.820
A.D.
 

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:21.070
And so what stands today is
primarily a later structure.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:24.533
But we do believe it was based
very closely on the original

00:16:24.533 --> 00:16:27.339
Julian building,
and in that regard is a very

00:16:27.339 --> 00:16:30.379
good reflection of what it would
have looked like.

00:16:30.379 --> 00:16:34.216
This coin over here shows the
temple as it was in the time of

00:16:34.216 --> 00:16:35.240
Julius Caesar.
 

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.860
We see the altar in the front,
the altar;

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.732
because the sacrifice always
takes place in the front of a

00:16:41.732 --> 00:16:42.490
Roman temple.
 

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.210
The temple itself,
with its columns that are

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.119
parted on this coin,
only to show the statue of

00:16:48.119 --> 00:16:50.840
Venus Genetrix inside:
the cult statue.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.090
The colonnades on either side.
 

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:55.090
And then if you look closely at
the pediment,

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.120
you can see that there's
sculpture in there,

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.974
and we have literary
descriptions of what that

00:16:59.974 --> 00:17:03.160
sculpture depicted,
and we know it was a scene of

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.559
Venus rising from the sea:
so Venus Genetrix rising from

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:07.240
the sea.
 

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.288
The closest thing probably to
it is something like,

00:17:10.288 --> 00:17:13.663
for those of you who know
it--Botticelli's Primavera

00:17:13.663 --> 00:17:16.974
 in Florence is probably
sort of the idea here for

00:17:16.974 --> 00:17:21.633
emerging from the waters,
and her depiction in this

00:17:21.633 --> 00:17:24.640
particular pediment above.
 

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.582
And we know that there were
also scenes of cupids carrying

00:17:28.582 --> 00:17:31.278
the arms and armor,
probably of Mars.

00:17:31.278 --> 00:17:34.406
This is me with a former
graduate student of mine and

00:17:34.406 --> 00:17:36.663
pointing out--
he wrote a dissertation on the

00:17:36.663 --> 00:17:39.231
Forum of Caesar,
which was afterwards published

00:17:39.231 --> 00:17:39.890
as a book.
 

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:44.535
But he's pointing out to me
here some of the architectural

00:17:44.535 --> 00:17:48.773
detail that still survives,
that one can see when one

00:17:48.773 --> 00:17:51.788
wanders through that forum
today.

00:17:51.788 --> 00:17:55.358
And you can see the very deep
drill work here,

00:17:55.358 --> 00:17:57.913
deep drill work that is
actually not characteristic of

00:17:57.913 --> 00:18:01.103
the time of Julius Caesar,
but rather of the time of

00:18:01.103 --> 00:18:02.608
Domitian and Trajan.
 

00:18:02.608 --> 00:18:08.084
So probably this decoration
belongs to the later renovation

00:18:08.084 --> 00:18:11.009
of this particular structure.
 

00:18:11.009 --> 00:18:14.417
This gives you perhaps the best
idea of what the temple would

00:18:14.417 --> 00:18:17.769
have looked like in the forum:
a restored view of the Temple

00:18:17.769 --> 00:18:20.778
of Venus Genetrix in the Forum
of Julius Caesar,

00:18:20.778 --> 00:18:23.569
with its inscription telling us
that Caesar,

00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:26.890
a dictator of Rome, put it up;
"fecit,"

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.009
as you can see here.
 

00:18:28.009 --> 00:18:30.240
You can see the tall podium.
 

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.077
You can see the façade
orientation, although again

00:18:34.077 --> 00:18:37.779
there was a staircase on three
sides of that podium.

00:18:37.779 --> 00:18:41.650
You can see the birth of Venus
in the pediment above.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:44.548
You can see the columns over
here of the side,

00:18:44.548 --> 00:18:47.834
the colonnade of one--of the
left side of the forum,

00:18:47.834 --> 00:18:50.539
which would have had statues on
bases.

00:18:50.539 --> 00:18:52.460
The shops behind.
 

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:57.173
And most importantly what this
restored view shows you is the

00:18:57.173 --> 00:19:01.964
relationship between the Temple
of Venus Genetrix and Caesar's

00:19:01.964 --> 00:19:04.230
Forum,
and the Capitolium,

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.808
on the top of the Capitoline
Hill.

00:19:06.808 --> 00:19:09.410
Because when you take away the
Victor Emmanuel Monument,

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:13.950
which is there now and which we
saw in the earlier image,

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.448
you can see that the building
that was up on top of the hill

00:19:17.448 --> 00:19:20.769
at this particular time was of
course the Capitolium,

00:19:20.769 --> 00:19:22.588
the Temple of Jupiter OMC.
 

00:19:22.588 --> 00:19:26.336
And I mentioned to you at the
time we talked about the Temple

00:19:26.336 --> 00:19:28.942
of Jupiter OMC,
although the Campidoglio,

00:19:28.942 --> 00:19:32.731
as redesigned by Michelangelo,
with the Senatorial Palace in

00:19:32.731 --> 00:19:35.507
the back,
which is where the Temple of

00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:38.308
Jupiter OMC was,
faces modern Rome.

00:19:38.308 --> 00:19:40.749
The ancient temple faced
ancient Rome,

00:19:40.749 --> 00:19:44.045
faced the Roman Forum,
and so you see it facing the

00:19:44.045 --> 00:19:46.548
Roman Forum in this restored
view.

00:19:46.548 --> 00:19:48.670
So I don't think it was
coincidental.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.867
The Romans were very careful,
as we've learned,

00:19:50.867 --> 00:19:53.448
about how they sited their
buildings, and they liked to

00:19:53.448 --> 00:19:55.788
make references from one
building to another.

00:19:55.788 --> 00:19:58.781
I don't think it is any
coincidence that Caesar chose

00:19:58.781 --> 00:20:02.063
this site for his Temple of
Venus so that anyone who gazed

00:20:02.063 --> 00:20:05.432
at it would also see,
out of the corner of their eye,

00:20:05.432 --> 00:20:07.670
the Temple of the Capitoline
Triad,

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:11.644
on the Capitoline Hill,
and that would only enhance

00:20:11.644 --> 00:20:15.858
Caesar's stature in the eyes of
his contemporaries.

00:20:15.858 --> 00:20:21.848
You see now portraits of Mark
Antony,

00:20:21.848 --> 00:20:25.611
on the right-hand of the
screen, a black basalt portrait

00:20:25.611 --> 00:20:27.597
of Antony,
now in England,

00:20:27.597 --> 00:20:30.598
and a portrait of Rome's first
emperor,

00:20:30.598 --> 00:20:34.818
Octavian Augustus,
on the left-hand of the screen,

00:20:34.818 --> 00:20:39.762
a fantastic bronze image of him
that was part of an equestrian

00:20:39.762 --> 00:20:43.328
statue found in the North Sea
near Greece.

00:20:43.328 --> 00:20:48.280
With regard to Antony and
Octavian, after Caesar's

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:53.838
assassination in 44 B.C.,
it was Mark Antony who rose to

00:20:53.838 --> 00:20:54.848
power.
 

00:20:54.848 --> 00:21:01.368
Octavian was only 19 at the
time--so your age--and he was

00:21:01.368 --> 00:21:04.630
the grandnephew of Caesar.
 

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:06.843
So he had a familial
relationship,

00:21:06.843 --> 00:21:10.801
although a fairly distant one,
to Caesar: the grandnephew of

00:21:10.801 --> 00:21:11.538
Caesar.
 

00:21:11.538 --> 00:21:17.011
And this 19-year-old upstart
tried to overthrow Mark Antony,

00:21:17.011 --> 00:21:19.608
and he was not successful.
 

00:21:19.608 --> 00:21:22.558
In the wise "If you can't
beat them,

00:21:22.558 --> 00:21:25.461
join them"
way of thinking about life and

00:21:25.461 --> 00:21:28.202
the world,
Octavian joined,

00:21:28.202 --> 00:21:32.009
with Antony,
with Mark Antony,

00:21:32.009 --> 00:21:35.375
and a man by the name of
Lepidus, to form what we know of

00:21:35.375 --> 00:21:39.838
as the Second Triumvirate,
and that happened in the year

00:21:39.838 --> 00:21:40.588
43 B.C.
 

00:21:40.588 --> 00:21:45.160
Once they had formed the Second
Triumvirate together,

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.660
Octavian and Antony took all of
their military forces--

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.190
and each of them had a
considerable amount--

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.907
and they combined them,
with the objective of going

00:21:54.907 --> 00:21:58.924
after Cassius and Brutus:
Cassius and Brutus who you'll

00:21:58.924 --> 00:22:01.380
remember had murdered Caesar.
 

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.380
And they were successful at so
doing.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:09.917
They beat and murdered Cassius
and Brutus at the Battle of

00:22:09.917 --> 00:22:12.930
Philippi, in the year 42 B.C.
 

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:17.574
A very important battle,
the Battle of Philippi in 42

00:22:17.574 --> 00:22:18.108
B.C.
 

00:22:18.108 --> 00:22:21.630
Mark Antony,
who not only rose to power

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:27.095
after Caesar's assassination,
but rose in the life and times

00:22:27.095 --> 00:22:28.670
of Cleopatra.
 

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.743
They had entered into--well
there's some rumors that this

00:22:31.743 --> 00:22:34.048
happened, or began much earlier
in time.

00:22:34.048 --> 00:22:36.769
But at any rate,
Mark Antony takes up with

00:22:36.769 --> 00:22:40.749
Cleopatra and he joins her in
Egypt and he spends a good deal

00:22:40.749 --> 00:22:45.259
of his time in the eastern part
of the Empire with his paramour.

00:22:45.259 --> 00:22:49.470
Octavian very smartly realized
Antony is distracted.

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:54.549
"This is a perfect time
for me to try once again to gain

00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:57.259
the supreme power that I want.
 

00:22:57.259 --> 00:23:00.936
I don't want to be part of a
threesome, I want to rule Rome

00:23:00.936 --> 00:23:02.650
completely, myself."
 

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:06.799
And he defeats Antony and
Cleopatra at one of the most

00:23:06.799 --> 00:23:10.895
famous battles of all time,
the Battle of Actium,

00:23:10.895 --> 00:23:15.884
a naval battle which took place
off the northwestern coast of

00:23:15.884 --> 00:23:19.750
Greece,
in 31 B.C.

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:24.923
After that very famous battle,
Antony and Cleopatra commit

00:23:24.923 --> 00:23:30.189
suicide and Octavian becomes the
sole emperor of this newly

00:23:30.189 --> 00:23:33.913
emerging super power,
and he is appointed as

00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:37.759
Augustus, which meant that he
had a special kind of majesty,

00:23:37.759 --> 00:23:42.038
in the year 27 B.C.
 

00:23:42.038 --> 00:23:47.537
We have additional information
about Augustus from Suetonius'

00:23:47.537 --> 00:23:52.097
biography of him--
he wrote one of him obviously

00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:56.270
as well--
and from Augustus' own account

00:23:56.270 --> 00:24:00.578
of his life and of his
accomplishments.

00:24:00.578 --> 00:24:04.156
I mentioned that Octavian--and
that's called the Res Gestae

00:24:04.156 --> 00:24:07.854
Divi Augusti--
I mentioned that Octavian took

00:24:07.854 --> 00:24:10.798
the title of Augustus in 27
B.C.,

00:24:10.798 --> 00:24:14.230
and he was emperor of Rome for
a very long time,

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:20.269
from that year 27 until his
death in AD 1.4.,

00:24:20.269 --> 00:24:24.065
at the age of 76,
which was a very ripe old age

00:24:24.065 --> 00:24:26.642
to live to,
at a time when most

00:24:26.642 --> 00:24:30.608
people--women were dying in
childbirth at 10 to 20,

00:24:30.608 --> 00:24:33.660
and men were dying,
for the most part,

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:34.890
in their thirties.
 

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.964
So 76 was a very old age
indeed, in ancient times,

00:24:37.964 --> 00:24:41.795
and it meant that Augustus was
emperor of Rome for a very long

00:24:41.795 --> 00:24:43.490
period, as you can see.
 

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:47.180
Now at his death,
Augustus deposited three

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.750
documents,
besides his will,

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:52.548
with the Vestal Virgins in
Rome,

00:24:52.548 --> 00:24:55.920
and these included instructions
for his funeral;

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.890
a kind of state of the union
address;

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:02.404
what was the situation in Rome
and in the Empire,

00:25:02.404 --> 00:25:06.358
at the time of his death,
or right before his death?

00:25:06.358 --> 00:25:09.518
And then most importantly for
us, a résumé

00:25:09.518 --> 00:25:11.425
of his acts,
a résumé

00:25:11.425 --> 00:25:13.900
of all of his accomplishments
during his lifetime,

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:18.531
which were meant to be carved
on two bronze plaques that were

00:25:18.531 --> 00:25:21.930
to be set up in front of his
tomb in Rome.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:27.160
These are the famous Res
Gestae Divi Augusti,

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:31.085
and that means the list of
things accomplished of the

00:25:31.085 --> 00:25:33.365
divine Augustus,
because Augustus,

00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:35.696
like Caesar before him,
was made a god,

00:25:35.696 --> 00:25:38.670
was transformed into a god at
his death.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:42.099
And this lists all of his
accomplishments at home and

00:25:42.099 --> 00:25:43.982
abroad--
the battles that he won,

00:25:43.982 --> 00:25:47.378
the cities that he formed--
but most important for us,

00:25:47.378 --> 00:25:51.088
it lists dozens and dozens of
building projects.

00:25:51.088 --> 00:25:54.432
For example,
it lists eighty-two temples

00:25:54.432 --> 00:25:59.490
that he either restored or built
in Rome, in Rome itself.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:04.281
So it gives you some sense of
the magnitude of this man's

00:26:04.281 --> 00:26:09.587
building objectives and is very
important to us as a compendium

00:26:09.587 --> 00:26:11.298
of what he does.
 

00:26:11.298 --> 00:26:12.890
Some of these buildings still
survive.

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:14.088
Some of them don't.
 

00:26:14.088 --> 00:26:16.818
But this is a very informative
list indeed,

00:26:16.818 --> 00:26:20.176
and it shows us that to
Augustus, as to Caesar before

00:26:20.176 --> 00:26:22.528
him,
the building of buildings was

00:26:22.528 --> 00:26:25.605
extremely important:
the making of buildings not

00:26:25.605 --> 00:26:29.598
only to remake Rome as a great
city of the ancient world,

00:26:29.598 --> 00:26:32.940
but also to leave something for
posterity,

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:36.058
and, of course,
both of them were successful in

00:26:36.058 --> 00:26:37.890
both of those objectives.
 

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:42.400
Very important for us today are
also the words of Suetonius.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:47.608
Suetonius tells us that
Augustus bragged that he--

00:26:47.608 --> 00:26:50.828
and I quote--"found Rome a
city of brick,

00:26:50.828 --> 00:26:54.470
and left Rome a city of
marble."

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:57.549
A city of brick,
meaning that brick tile that we

00:26:57.549 --> 00:27:00.443
saw in Pompeii,
he found a Rome that was built

00:27:00.443 --> 00:27:03.930
out of that same kind of brick
tile that we saw at Pompeii,

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:08.394
but he wanted to transform,
he left the city of Rome a city

00:27:08.394 --> 00:27:09.318
of marble.
 

00:27:09.318 --> 00:27:14.111
And that's exactly the major
thrust of today's lecture:

00:27:14.111 --> 00:27:18.724
Augustus builds Rome as a
marble city in the model of

00:27:18.724 --> 00:27:22.798
ancient Greece,
in the model of Athens,

00:27:22.798 --> 00:27:26.000
in the Greek part of the world.
 

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.700
It's a rhetorical exaggeration,
but we're going to see,

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.088
from the two Augustan buildings
that I show you today,

00:27:31.088 --> 00:27:34.813
that it wasn't far off the
mark, that he really did create

00:27:34.813 --> 00:27:37.319
a city of marble,
on the Tiber,

00:27:37.319 --> 00:27:42.029
and he left for posterity that
Greek marble city,

00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:48.095
a Hellenized city that builds
on the Hellenization of Roman

00:27:48.095 --> 00:27:53.009
architecture that we've already
talked about.

00:27:53.009 --> 00:27:58.523
What made Augustus' boast
possible was the fact for the

00:27:58.523 --> 00:28:04.958
first time in its history a high
quality marble was available to

00:28:04.958 --> 00:28:09.535
Rome, in close proximity;
that is, marble from Italy

00:28:09.535 --> 00:28:12.019
itself, as opposed to imported
marbles.

00:28:12.019 --> 00:28:15.529
We've seen up to this point
that the Romans wanted to build

00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:19.221
marble buildings;
that they created faux marble

00:28:19.221 --> 00:28:23.256
walls, the First Style,
at Pompeii for example,

00:28:23.256 --> 00:28:25.009
and also in Rome.
 

00:28:25.009 --> 00:28:29.569
That they created temples with
columns and superstructures that

00:28:29.569 --> 00:28:32.592
were made out of tufa,
or travertine,

00:28:32.592 --> 00:28:36.140
and then they stuccoed those
over white,

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.199
to make them look like marble,
even though they were not

00:28:39.199 --> 00:28:39.700
marble.
 

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:43.942
But that they just didn't have
access to marble readily enough

00:28:43.942 --> 00:28:46.375
to transform,
to actually make these

00:28:46.375 --> 00:28:48.808
buildings out of marble itself.
 

00:28:48.808 --> 00:28:51.650
There was some flirtation with
it.

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:56.009
They did import a certain
amount of Greek marble to use,

00:28:56.009 --> 00:28:58.559
for some buildings,
but it wasn't available at a

00:28:58.559 --> 00:29:01.435
low enough cost to allow the
kind of full-scale marble

00:29:01.435 --> 00:29:03.390
building that they wanted to do.
 

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:09.308
What happens in the end of the
reign of Caesar and into--

00:29:09.308 --> 00:29:13.145
or the dictatorship of Caesar
and into the emperorship of

00:29:13.145 --> 00:29:16.640
Augustus is that all of a sudden
a high quality,

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:20.160
relatively inexpensive marble
becomes available.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.588
Because what happens is the
Romans begin to exploit,

00:29:23.588 --> 00:29:26.858
in the late Caesarian period
and into the age of Augustus,

00:29:26.858 --> 00:29:31.586
the marble quarries at Luna,
on the northwest coast of

00:29:31.586 --> 00:29:32.298
Italy.
 

00:29:32.298 --> 00:29:37.511
This is the same town as modern
Carrara, the same quarries that

00:29:37.511 --> 00:29:42.221
were used centuries later by
none other than Michelangelo

00:29:42.221 --> 00:29:43.230
himself.
 

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:45.905
Carrara marble,
you all know Carrara marble,

00:29:45.905 --> 00:29:48.583
called Luna,
the site called Luna in ancient

00:29:48.583 --> 00:29:49.579
Roman times.
 

00:29:49.579 --> 00:29:51.259
So Luna or Carrara marble.
 

00:29:51.259 --> 00:29:54.698
I show you a view here of the
marble quarries,

00:29:54.698 --> 00:29:58.212
or one of the marble quarries,
at Luna/Carrara,

00:29:58.212 --> 00:30:00.430
what it looks like today.
 

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:04.567
This is a re-enactment of
bringing the marble blocks down

00:30:04.567 --> 00:30:07.818
from the mountain for use in
construction.

00:30:07.818 --> 00:30:11.752
They basically do it the same
way today as they probably did

00:30:11.752 --> 00:30:13.618
it in ancient Roman times.
 

00:30:13.618 --> 00:30:18.009
And it was fairly easy to get
this.

00:30:18.009 --> 00:30:20.980
Since it was on the coast,
it was fairly easy to load this

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.116
marble into boats,
bring it down to Ostia,

00:30:23.116 --> 00:30:24.890
and then up the Tiber to Rome.
 

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.890
And that began to be done,
with great success,

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:30.288
especially in the age of
Augustus.

00:30:30.288 --> 00:30:32.779
Going to Carrara today is a
pleasure.

00:30:32.779 --> 00:30:34.588
It's an interesting place to
visit,

00:30:34.588 --> 00:30:38.836
especially if you go there at
the time of the marble

00:30:38.836 --> 00:30:43.750
exhibition that they have and
the competition that they have

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:48.663
where people make whatever out
of Carrara marble and compete

00:30:48.663 --> 00:30:50.078
for prizes.
 

00:30:50.078 --> 00:30:55.407
And I show you a view taken
during one of these contests

00:30:55.407 --> 00:30:57.828
here now on the screen.
 

00:30:57.828 --> 00:31:01.157
And there are some amazing,
amazing works of art,

00:31:01.157 --> 00:31:04.000
we might call them,
that come out of these

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.180
competitions.
 

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.519
Here's one of my favorites.
 

00:31:06.519 --> 00:31:14.221
You see over here the Luna
marble version of an Italian

00:31:14.221 --> 00:31:16.220
Cinquecento.
 

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:19.005
These Cinquecentos,
which were miniscule,

00:31:19.005 --> 00:31:23.323
are not--not many of them exist
today, although you do see some

00:31:23.323 --> 00:31:25.828
antique versions here and there.
 

00:31:25.828 --> 00:31:28.511
But I had one of these once,
and you can see a picture of me

00:31:28.511 --> 00:31:31.209
in fact here,
in front of American Express,

00:31:31.209 --> 00:31:34.865
not far from the Spanish Steps,
the Piazza di Spagna,

00:31:34.865 --> 00:31:36.279
with my Cinquecento.
 

00:31:36.279 --> 00:31:37.539
It was a long time ago.
 

00:31:37.539 --> 00:31:39.220
But you can see how small it is.
 

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:44.759
I'm actually standing on the
front passenger side and popping

00:31:44.759 --> 00:31:47.160
up through the sun roof.
 

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.892
But my size there--and I'm
about 5'7--compared to the car,

00:31:50.892 --> 00:31:54.690
gives you some sense of how
small these cars were today.

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:57.685
So the Italians have been very
good about this sort of thing

00:31:57.685 --> 00:31:59.059
for some time,
and continue,

00:31:59.059 --> 00:32:00.200
as you well know,
to drive,

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.858
for the most part,
small cars through the city.

00:32:03.858 --> 00:32:08.555
And another one of my favorite
entries into the competition are

00:32:08.555 --> 00:32:12.492
these Luna marble decapitated
heads of Juan and Evita

00:32:12.492 --> 00:32:16.203
Perón that were put
forward in one of these

00:32:16.203 --> 00:32:18.778
competitions some years ago.
 

00:32:18.778 --> 00:32:23.240
With regard to transforming
Rome into a marble city,

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:27.880
now that Carrara marble was
available at a fairly low cost,

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.848
compared to the importation of
Greek marbles,

00:32:30.848 --> 00:32:34.170
Augustus begins to build his
marble city.

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:38.914
And I'm going to show you two
major commissions of Augustus

00:32:38.914 --> 00:32:39.568
today.
 

00:32:39.568 --> 00:32:42.960
The first of these is the Forum
of Augustus in Rome,

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.838
a forum--or the Forum Augustum
in Rome--

00:32:46.838 --> 00:32:52.273
that was very much in Augustus'
mind from the beginning of his

00:32:52.273 --> 00:32:53.700
rise to power.
 

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:58.102
In fact, it's Suetonius who
tells us that the reason that

00:32:58.102 --> 00:33:02.740
Augustus built a forum in Rome
was because even though there

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.650
were already two forums in
Rome--

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:08.858
that includes the Roman Forum
and the Forum of Julius Caesar--

00:33:08.858 --> 00:33:11.940
even though those two existed
and were both being used,

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:15.534
that the population--Suetonius
tells us the population was

00:33:15.534 --> 00:33:19.369
growing by leaps and bounds,
as were the need to try

00:33:19.369 --> 00:33:23.738
judicial cases,
and that the spaces in the

00:33:23.738 --> 00:33:28.646
forums--of the Roman Forum,
and in the Forum of Julius

00:33:28.646 --> 00:33:32.373
Caesar--did not allow for the
needs of the populace or for the

00:33:32.373 --> 00:33:36.096
needs of these judicial cases,
and that they needed to build

00:33:36.096 --> 00:33:36.950
another forum.
 

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:39.748
Well, that's a good story,
but the likelihood is it had

00:33:39.748 --> 00:33:41.769
pretty much nothing to do with
that--

00:33:41.769 --> 00:33:43.088
it may have had something to do
with that,

00:33:43.088 --> 00:33:46.307
but not a lot to do with
that--because Augustus had

00:33:46.307 --> 00:33:47.529
ulterior motives.
 

00:33:47.529 --> 00:33:50.441
Augustus -- it was at the
Battle of Philippi,

00:33:50.441 --> 00:33:52.029
that battle of 42 B.C.
 

00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:57.122
when Mark Antony and Octavian
joined forces to defeat the

00:33:57.122 --> 00:33:59.759
assassins of Julius Caesar.
 

00:33:59.759 --> 00:34:03.940
It was right before that battle
that Augustus vowed that if he

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:06.035
won,
if he were successful,

00:34:06.035 --> 00:34:09.780
that he would build a temple to
Mars the Avenger,

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:14.320
Mars Ultor, U-l-t-o-r,
Mars Ultor, Mars the Avenger,

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.893
in gratitude for helping him
avenge the death of Julius

00:34:18.893 --> 00:34:21.420
Caesar,
the murder of Julius Caesar,

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:23.579
the assassination of Julius
Caesar.

00:34:23.579 --> 00:34:26.947
And so when he was successful,
he said, "I will build

00:34:26.947 --> 00:34:28.130
that temple."
 

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:30.500
And that temple needed an
environment,

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.806
and as we've seen,
Romans often built temples

00:34:33.806 --> 00:34:37.195
inside complexes,
whether it was sanctuaries or

00:34:37.195 --> 00:34:40.224
forums,
and so he had a good excuse to

00:34:40.224 --> 00:34:45.943
build a major forum in Rome,
as a domicile for the Temple of

00:34:45.943 --> 00:34:47.210
Mars Ultor.
 

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.320
He didn't get around to it for
awhile--

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:53.012
again, the Battle of Philippi,
42--but he had a lot of other

00:34:53.012 --> 00:34:55.806
things to contend with,
namely Mark Antony and

00:34:55.806 --> 00:34:56.389
Cleopatra.
 

00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:58.835
It wasn't until after the
Battle of Actium,

00:34:58.835 --> 00:35:02.331
when he got rid of the two of
them, that he had time to build

00:35:02.331 --> 00:35:04.079
this Temple to Mars Ultor.
 

00:35:04.079 --> 00:35:07.570
And we see it beginning to go
up in 28 B.C.--

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:10.309
so considerably later than the
original battle--

00:35:10.309 --> 00:35:13.429
28 B.C., and it was dedicated
in Rome,

00:35:13.429 --> 00:35:19.369
on a very important date,
the date of 2 B.C.

00:35:19.369 --> 00:35:23.429
So begun in 28 B.C.
 

00:35:23.429 --> 00:35:26.213
and dedicated in 2 B.C.,
and that's the date that I've

00:35:26.213 --> 00:35:30.157
given you on the Monument List,
the dedication of the Temple of

00:35:30.157 --> 00:35:33.429
Mars Ultor and the Forum of
Augustus in 2 B.C.

00:35:33.429 --> 00:35:35.119
We see its plan here.
 

00:35:35.119 --> 00:35:39.014
We will see momentarily that it
was built in very close

00:35:39.014 --> 00:35:42.001
approximation ;
in fact, right next to the

00:35:42.001 --> 00:35:43.630
Forum of Julius Caesar.
 

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:44.719
Why?
 

00:35:44.719 --> 00:35:47.500
Because, of course,
Augustus wanted to associate

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.400
himself with his divine adoptive
father Caesar.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.219
So he puts his own forum right
next to Caesar's.

00:35:53.219 --> 00:35:55.210
We see the Forum of Augustus
here.

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:59.074
We can see that it follows in
the main, the plan of the Forum

00:35:59.074 --> 00:36:00.300
of Julius Caesar.
 

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.949
It is a rectangular space,
open to the sky,

00:36:03.949 --> 00:36:09.719
with colonnades on either side,
with a temple in the center,

00:36:09.719 --> 00:36:13.172
pushed up against the back
wall, and dominating the space

00:36:13.172 --> 00:36:14.219
in front of it.
 

00:36:14.219 --> 00:36:17.969
The only change here is the
addition of these hemicycles,

00:36:17.969 --> 00:36:20.994
one on either side,
looking very much like the

00:36:20.994 --> 00:36:24.824
hemicycles that we looked at
from the Sanctuary of Fortuna

00:36:24.824 --> 00:36:26.869
Primigenia,
at Palestrina:

00:36:26.869 --> 00:36:29.983
these embracing arms that
served to accentuate

00:36:29.983 --> 00:36:34.000
architecturally and visually the
temple in the center,

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.909
and that also served as a
place--there are niches on

00:36:36.909 --> 00:36:40.219
either side where they could put
statuary and the like,

00:36:40.219 --> 00:36:43.630
seen through the columns,
as you can see here.

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:46.867
The Temple of Mars Ultor
itself, again very similar to

00:36:46.867 --> 00:36:48.809
temples,
early Roman temples that we've

00:36:48.809 --> 00:36:51.666
been talking about,
using the Etruscan plan:

00:36:51.666 --> 00:36:55.286
façade orientation,
single staircase,

00:36:55.286 --> 00:36:59.110
deep porch, freestanding
columns in that porch,

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.619
freestanding columns on either
side,

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:04.960
but yet, like an Etruscan
temple, a flat back wall.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.231
As you can see here,
some columns inside,

00:37:08.231 --> 00:37:12.974
decorating the cella of the
temple, and then a single niche

00:37:12.974 --> 00:37:15.510
for the cult statue inside.
 

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:19.264
And note here also the
base--I'll say something about

00:37:19.264 --> 00:37:22.369
the statue that stood on that
base later.

00:37:22.369 --> 00:37:26.882
Here's a Google Earth view of
this part of Rome,

00:37:26.882 --> 00:37:30.050
showing the connection between.
 

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:33.250
You can see here the Forum of
Julius Caesar as it looks today.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.360
This is the entrance.
 

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.739
We're moving back toward the
Capitoline Hill.

00:37:36.739 --> 00:37:39.289
These are those three columns
that I showed you before,

00:37:39.289 --> 00:37:41.684
are still preserved,
as well as the columns of the

00:37:41.684 --> 00:37:43.639
colonnade,
on the left side,

00:37:43.639 --> 00:37:45.889
that entered into the shops.
 

00:37:45.889 --> 00:37:52.000
Here's the modern Via dei Fori
Imperiali, built by Mussolini.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.483
What Mussolini did was slice
the Roman Forum and Julian Forum

00:37:55.483 --> 00:37:58.445
from the so-called Imperial
Fora, to which they were

00:37:58.445 --> 00:38:01.585
originally attached;
and any of you who've been in

00:38:01.585 --> 00:38:05.260
Rome recently know that this
entire area is being excavated.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.699
The plan is--the street is
still there now,

00:38:07.699 --> 00:38:09.827
but the plan is
eventually--we'll see whether

00:38:09.827 --> 00:38:13.909
this really happens,
because it would be a traffic

00:38:13.909 --> 00:38:16.679
nightmare--
but the plan is to take that

00:38:16.679 --> 00:38:20.143
Mussolini street down eventually
and reunite all of these forums

00:38:20.143 --> 00:38:22.619
in some great archaeological
park someday.

00:38:22.619 --> 00:38:24.519
It would be exciting if that
were to happen.

00:38:24.519 --> 00:38:25.829
So the modern street.
 

00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:29.864
But initially the Forum of
Caesar would have stood exactly

00:38:29.864 --> 00:38:32.130
next to the Forum of Augustus.
 

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:35.193
We see that here,
and if you look carefully you

00:38:35.193 --> 00:38:38.324
can see the remains of the
Temple of Mars Ultor,

00:38:38.324 --> 00:38:41.590
as well as a precinct wall that
is preserved.

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:46.353
It was a 115-foot precinct
wall, protecting the forum from

00:38:46.353 --> 00:38:50.199
just the area we were talking
about before--

00:38:50.199 --> 00:38:53.614
that question about housing for
the well-to-do and the less

00:38:53.614 --> 00:38:58.170
well-to-do in ancient Rome--
protecting the forum from the

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:00.422
so-called Subura,
S-u-b-u-r-a,

00:39:00.422 --> 00:39:02.539
which was that area of Rome in
which all of those rickety,

00:39:02.539 --> 00:39:05.557
wooden tenement houses were
located and which were

00:39:05.557 --> 00:39:09.411
constantly going up in fires,
to protect the temple--because

00:39:09.411 --> 00:39:12.822
marble can burn--
to protect the Temple of Mars

00:39:12.822 --> 00:39:17.072
Ultor from all of that stuff
that was back there in the

00:39:17.072 --> 00:39:17.860
Subura.
 

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:20.199
Here's another view from Google
Earth,

00:39:20.199 --> 00:39:23.585
taken from the other side,
showing the remains of the

00:39:23.585 --> 00:39:27.188
Temple of Mars Ultor,
pushed up against the back

00:39:27.188 --> 00:39:30.010
wall, and then that precinct
wall,

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:31.760
that is very well-preserved,
snaking its way around,

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:36.030
dividing the forum proper,
the sacred space,

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:38.809
from the residential area
called the Subura that was

00:39:38.809 --> 00:39:39.300
behind.
 

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:44.940
Here's a view of the precinct
wall as it looks from the

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.969
outside of the forum today.
 

00:39:47.969 --> 00:39:50.927
There are some additions that
were made in later times,

00:39:50.927 --> 00:39:54.161
Medieval-looking windows and
the like, but for the most part

00:39:54.161 --> 00:39:55.750
it's preserved as it was.
 

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:58.289
You can see we're dealing with
ashlar blocks,

00:39:58.289 --> 00:40:01.349
made out of peperino
stone, p-e-p-e-r-i-n-o.

00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:03.280
We've talked about
peperino before.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.960
It's a form of tufa,
a stone that was used here with

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.920
ashlar blocks,
for the encircling precinct

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:10.570
wall.
 

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:14.286
You can see the coloration of
those peperino blocks,

00:40:14.286 --> 00:40:16.210
grayish/brownish color here.
 

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:20.768
And you can see the difference
between that and the temple,

00:40:20.768 --> 00:40:22.860
the remains of the temple,
the columns,

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:25.445
the steps of the temple,
as well as some other

00:40:25.445 --> 00:40:29.657
decoration,
and also some of the walls were

00:40:29.657 --> 00:40:35.920
made out of Luna or Carrara
marble: Luna or Carrara marble

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.010
for this temple.
 

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.030
This is a view of the Temple of
Mars Ultor as it looks today.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.684
It's in ruinous state,
but enough is preserved for us

00:40:42.684 --> 00:40:45.800
to get a very good sense of what
it originally looked like.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.639
You can see that the podium is
tall.

00:40:47.639 --> 00:40:50.039
You can see that it's made out
of tufa.

00:40:50.039 --> 00:40:55.224
You can see that the steps are
sheathed in Carrara marble,

00:40:55.224 --> 00:41:00.230
brought from those quarries
that we discussed before.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:03.865
You can see that the columns
were also made out of solid

00:41:03.865 --> 00:41:04.989
Carrara marble.
 

00:41:04.989 --> 00:41:06.039
We see that here.
 

00:41:06.039 --> 00:41:08.807
We see a wall in Carrara
marble, and we see the

00:41:08.807 --> 00:41:12.239
distinction between that and the
peperino walls.

00:41:12.239 --> 00:41:13.949
You can also see,
in this very good view,

00:41:13.949 --> 00:41:19.090
one of the hemicycles on the
left-hand side,

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:22.110
and you can see those niches
that I mentioned before,

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:26.445
that would have held statuary
that you could see through the

00:41:26.445 --> 00:41:27.179
columns.
 

00:41:27.179 --> 00:41:30.570
This is a restored view in the
Ward-Perkins textbook,

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:35.706
which shows you what the temple
would have looked like in

00:41:35.706 --> 00:41:39.393
antiquity,
when it was in its final form,

00:41:39.393 --> 00:41:42.885
and you can see everything
we've described:

00:41:42.885 --> 00:41:45.396
the tall podium,
single staircase,

00:41:45.396 --> 00:41:46.739
façade orientation.
 

00:41:46.739 --> 00:41:49.744
You can see also that there was
sculpture in the pediment,

00:41:49.744 --> 00:41:51.590
and we know something about
that.

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:54.110
You can see the columns on
either side,

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:56.039
and you can see in the second
story--

00:41:56.039 --> 00:42:00.000
you can barely make them out
but take my word,

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.512
those are, instead of columns
they are figures of women that

00:42:02.512 --> 00:42:04.130
we're going to say something
about,

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:06.730
and you can see those again on
both sides.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:10.447
So this gives you a sense of
what the temple would've looked

00:42:10.447 --> 00:42:11.768
like in its heyday.
 

00:42:11.768 --> 00:42:16.164
The favored capital column
type, and capital of the Romans,

00:42:16.164 --> 00:42:19.119
the Corinthian,
is what is used here.

00:42:19.119 --> 00:42:23.949
You can see a preserved
capital, and how beautifully

00:42:23.949 --> 00:42:27.454
rendered they were:
very high quality,

00:42:27.454 --> 00:42:32.000
capitals done out of Luna or
Carrara marble.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.018
We can see the characteristic
triple row of acanthus leaves,

00:42:34.018 --> 00:42:36.099
the spiral volutes growing out
of those,

00:42:36.099 --> 00:42:40.157
the central flower that we see
always in the Corinthian order

00:42:40.157 --> 00:42:44.213
for the columns that were used
for the temple and for most of

00:42:44.213 --> 00:42:47.460
the side columns on the first
story as well.

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:51.666
But in some cases those columns
were replaced with others that

00:42:51.666 --> 00:42:55.251
have instead of the spiral
volutes growing out of the

00:42:55.251 --> 00:42:58.295
acanthus leaves,
pegasi, winged horses,

00:42:58.295 --> 00:43:02.139
and I show you a detail of one
of those pegasi here.

00:43:02.139 --> 00:43:06.690
A capital with an animal,
replacing the spirals,

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:11.050
is called a zoomorphic capital:
zoo, z-o-o;

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:14.418
zoomorphic,
z-o-o-m-o-r-p-h-i-c,

00:43:14.418 --> 00:43:16.699
zoomorphic capital.
 

00:43:16.699 --> 00:43:21.105
And it's interesting to note
that we see similar zoomorphic

00:43:21.105 --> 00:43:25.360
capitals in Greece a bit earlier
than this structure,

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:28.501
at a gateway that I'm going to
show you at a place called

00:43:28.501 --> 00:43:30.719
Eleusis--
we'll return to this when we

00:43:30.719 --> 00:43:33.349
discuss Roman Greece later in
this semester--

00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:35.264
and these have,
instead of pegasi,

00:43:35.264 --> 00:43:38.929
these have bull protomes,
the tops of bulls emanating out

00:43:38.929 --> 00:43:40.510
of the acanthus leaves.
 

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:42.380
But I show it to you to make
one point,

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:44.947
and that is that it seems very
likely that there was some

00:43:44.947 --> 00:43:46.690
interesting architectural
exchange--

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:52.195
ideas, architects and so
on--going on between Athens and

00:43:52.195 --> 00:43:56.000
Rome in the late Republican
period,

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.469
in the time of Julius Caesar
and into the age of Augustus,

00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:01.750
and it's an issue that we'll
return to in the future.

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:05.759
We're going to see that
Augustus not only builds his

00:44:05.759 --> 00:44:10.239
marble city in order to make it
look more like Greece,

00:44:10.239 --> 00:44:13.414
more like Athens,
and to connect his new Golden

00:44:13.414 --> 00:44:16.659
Age with the Golden Age of
Periclean Athens,

00:44:16.659 --> 00:44:20.719
but we see very specific Greek
models being used.

00:44:20.719 --> 00:44:23.697
For example,
one of these is a frieze from

00:44:23.697 --> 00:44:25.440
the Forum of Augustus.
 

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:29.844
The other is a frieze from one
of the three temples on the

00:44:29.844 --> 00:44:32.612
Acropolis,
in Athens, of the fifth century

00:44:32.612 --> 00:44:35.172
B.C.,
the so-called Erechtheion,

00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:37.889
or Erectheum,
in the Latinized version,

00:44:37.889 --> 00:44:41.181
and one of these is from one
and one of these is from the

00:44:41.181 --> 00:44:41.710
other.
 

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:44.070
And I just wondered quickly if
any of you want to guess which

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:46.469
is the Roman one and which is
the Greek one that it copies?

00:44:46.469 --> 00:44:50.534
You can see this alternation of
the lotus and palmette leaves

00:44:50.534 --> 00:44:51.010
here.
 

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:52.920
Any quick thoughts?
 

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:58.119
How many of you think this is
the Greek one?

00:44:58.119 --> 00:45:01.369
How many of you think this is
the Greek one?

00:45:01.369 --> 00:45:03.574
This is the Roman one;
this is the Roman one at the

00:45:03.574 --> 00:45:05.059
top, this is the Greek one down
here.

00:45:05.059 --> 00:45:07.114
The Greek one down here,
more deeply undercut,

00:45:07.114 --> 00:45:08.849
which is I think what throws
people.

00:45:08.849 --> 00:45:11.690
The Roman one,
from the Forum of Augustus up

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:12.219
above.
 

00:45:12.219 --> 00:45:15.262
But the important point for us
again, that they are looking

00:45:15.262 --> 00:45:17.572
back at Greek buildings of the
fifth century,

00:45:17.572 --> 00:45:19.619
and they are copying what they
see.

00:45:19.619 --> 00:45:23.079
We see here a model of the
Forum of Augustus,

00:45:23.079 --> 00:45:26.719
with the Temple of Mars Ultor
inside that forum,

00:45:26.719 --> 00:45:32.219
with the embracing exedrae or
hemicycles on either side.

00:45:32.219 --> 00:45:36.018
You can see that the exterior
of the structure was quite

00:45:36.018 --> 00:45:38.972
plain,
just in the way that a Domus

00:45:38.972 --> 00:45:43.677
Italica outside was plain,
and it was only when you got

00:45:43.677 --> 00:45:47.865
inside that you got a real sense
of the glory of the

00:45:47.865 --> 00:45:49.179
architecture.
 

00:45:49.179 --> 00:45:51.030
So I think you can see well
here.

00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:54.534
And most interesting for us,
I mentioned that these columns

00:45:54.534 --> 00:45:57.963
on the temple were Corinthian;
the columns on the first story

00:45:57.963 --> 00:45:59.309
over here were Corinthian.
 

00:45:59.309 --> 00:46:02.557
But in the second story,
on the left and right sides of

00:46:02.557 --> 00:46:05.717
the forum,
the columns are replaced by

00:46:05.717 --> 00:46:08.614
figures of women,
by figures of maidens,

00:46:08.614 --> 00:46:11.010
and I show you two of them have
survived--

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:12.300
two of them are well-preserved.
 

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.039
I show them to you here.
 

00:46:14.039 --> 00:46:17.320
These figures of maidens that
replace the columns,

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:20.920
that support the capitals,
on top of their heads,

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:26.173
and they flank this shield in
the center with the depiction of

00:46:26.173 --> 00:46:27.380
a male head.
 

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:32.813
This is the god Jupiter,
a certain guise of the god

00:46:32.813 --> 00:46:34.521
Jupiter,
Jupiter Ammon,

00:46:34.521 --> 00:46:38.061
as you can see him here,
and we have information that

00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:43.338
tells us that Alexander the
Great used to place shields in

00:46:43.338 --> 00:46:46.697
the Parthenon in Athens,
and elsewhere,

00:46:46.697 --> 00:46:49.873
after great military victories,
and it is possible that that

00:46:49.873 --> 00:46:51.920
sort of thing is being referred
to here,

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:54.679
because we know Augustus,
like Pompey before him,

00:46:54.679 --> 00:46:59.070
had a thing for Alexander and
liked to associate himself with

00:46:59.070 --> 00:46:59.949
Alexander.
 

00:46:59.949 --> 00:47:04.369
But most important for us is
the fact that these maidens have

00:47:04.369 --> 00:47:07.170
clear precedents in the Greek
world.

00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:10.699
The famous Porch of the Maidens
on the Athenian Acropolis,

00:47:10.699 --> 00:47:14.159
fifth century B.C.,
the Erechtheion again--

00:47:14.159 --> 00:47:19.210
E-r-e-c-h-t-h-e-i-o-n,
in the Greek version--

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:23.570
the Erectheion of Athens,
fifth century B.C.

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:24.989
Same set of maidens.
 

00:47:24.989 --> 00:47:28.418
We know that these had fallen
into disrepair in the age of

00:47:28.418 --> 00:47:29.079
Augustus.
 

00:47:29.079 --> 00:47:30.880
Augustus visited Athens three
times.

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.719
He did not like seeing these in
disrepair,

00:47:33.719 --> 00:47:37.297
and in fact he had his own
architects replace one of them

00:47:37.297 --> 00:47:40.771
with a Roman copy,
and while they were doing that,

00:47:40.771 --> 00:47:43.730
they made plaster casts of
these maidens,

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:46.518
they brought those plaster
casts back to Rome,

00:47:46.518 --> 00:47:53.606
and then in reduced scale they
duplicated them for the Forum of

00:47:53.606 --> 00:47:55.780
Augustus in Rome.
 

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:59.807
So appropriations from Greece;
appropriations in part because

00:47:59.807 --> 00:48:03.079
Augustus liked them,
but also I don't think there's

00:48:03.079 --> 00:48:06.780
any question that he was trying
to draw a relationship between

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:09.260
himself,
his new Golden Age,

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:12.949
and the Golden Age of Periclean
Athens.

00:48:12.949 --> 00:48:15.670
We also have evidence for what
the pediment,

00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:19.467
the sculpture in the pediment
looked like, and I want to turn

00:48:19.467 --> 00:48:20.480
to that now.
 

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:25.030
This is a relief that dates to
a slightly later period that

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:29.344
purports to represent the
pediment of the Temple of Mars

00:48:29.344 --> 00:48:30.130
Ultor.
 

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:33.536
And I show it to you here,
and we can tell from this

00:48:33.536 --> 00:48:37.208
exactly what the sculptural
display was all about in the

00:48:37.208 --> 00:48:39.079
pediment of this temple.
 

00:48:39.079 --> 00:48:41.431
We see here in the center,
not surprisingly,

00:48:41.431 --> 00:48:44.561
Mars Ultor himself;
Mars Ultor depicted with a bare

00:48:44.561 --> 00:48:45.010
chest.
 

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:47.554
Next to him,
to his right,

00:48:47.554 --> 00:48:51.829
to our left,
we see a figure of a woman.

00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:54.280
This is Venus,
and Venus, as you can see,

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:56.550
has something on her left
shoulder.

00:48:56.550 --> 00:48:57.639
It is a Cupid.
 

00:48:57.639 --> 00:49:03.860
So Venus with Cupid,
Venus the consort of Mars.

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:07.460
And then over here a
personification that we believe

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:10.213
depicts Fortuna:
Fortuna, the goddess of

00:49:10.213 --> 00:49:14.380
Fortune, who brought fortune to
Augustus in his battle.

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:18.018
And then over here,
a seated figure of Roma,

00:49:18.018 --> 00:49:20.219
with her arms and armor.
 

00:49:20.219 --> 00:49:23.097
Keep this figure in your mind,
because I'm going to show you

00:49:23.097 --> 00:49:24.659
another seated Roma very soon.
 

00:49:24.659 --> 00:49:28.547
And then over here,
a reclining figure of the Tiber

00:49:28.547 --> 00:49:31.889
River, the river on which Rome
was built.

00:49:31.889 --> 00:49:34.853
Over here, a seated figure we
believe is Romulus,

00:49:34.853 --> 00:49:37.570
the founder of Rome,
on the Palatine Hill.

00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:41.869
And over here a reclining
personification of the Palatine.

00:49:41.869 --> 00:49:44.599
So, most important,
that the building honored,

00:49:44.599 --> 00:49:47.329
of course, Mars Ultor,
and that Mars Ultor was

00:49:47.329 --> 00:49:49.090
depicted in the pediment.
 

00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:52.570
There was also a cult statue
inside the Temple of Mars,

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:55.768
and we believe we know what
that looked like as well,

00:49:55.768 --> 00:49:59.418
because we believe we have a
copy of it in a relief from

00:49:59.418 --> 00:50:03.333
Algiers that is still preserved,
that depicts Mars,

00:50:03.333 --> 00:50:06.789
in the center,
this Mars Ultor again,

00:50:06.789 --> 00:50:09.557
this time the warlike Mars
Ultor, because you can see he's

00:50:09.557 --> 00:50:11.550
wearing his breastplate and his
helmet.

00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:14.085
His consort,
Venus, is once again by his

00:50:14.085 --> 00:50:14.539
side.
 

00:50:14.539 --> 00:50:17.119
Venus is leaning on a pedestal.
 

00:50:17.119 --> 00:50:18.750
She's very seductive.
 

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:22.532
Her drapery is falling off her
shoulder, as you can see,

00:50:22.532 --> 00:50:24.389
as she looks toward Mars.
 

00:50:24.389 --> 00:50:27.936
And then Cupid down here,
offering her a sword in a

00:50:27.936 --> 00:50:30.420
sheath, probably Mars' own
sword.

00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:33.679
And then over here a figure
that's very controversial,

00:50:33.679 --> 00:50:36.730
a youthful looking figure with
a bare chest,

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:39.280
and you can see a full cap of
hair,

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:44.034
and we think that he is
actually the divinized Julius

00:50:44.034 --> 00:50:46.480
Caesar,
very botoxed compared to

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:50.369
what--he's rejuvenated compared
to what he looked like in that

00:50:50.369 --> 00:50:53.367
green diabase portrait that I
showed you before:

00:50:53.367 --> 00:50:55.869
a very youthful,
divine Caesar,

00:50:55.869 --> 00:51:00.735
which shows you what happens to
people in Roman times when they

00:51:00.735 --> 00:51:02.150
were divinized.
 

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:05.728
They were able to shed a fair
number of years and were

00:51:05.728 --> 00:51:09.173
depicted in much younger
versions in their divinized

00:51:09.173 --> 00:51:09.849
state.
 

00:51:09.849 --> 00:51:11.768
So this probably a reflection.
 

00:51:11.768 --> 00:51:13.820
As you can see,
the figures stand on bases,

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:16.858
and figures that stand on bases
in Roman relief sculpture are

00:51:16.858 --> 00:51:20.085
usually meant to be statues,
and we believe that this is

00:51:20.085 --> 00:51:23.885
again a rendition of what that
triple set of statues would have

00:51:23.885 --> 00:51:25.909
looked like inside the temple.
 

00:51:25.909 --> 00:51:29.583
To return to the plan quickly,
just to make the point that the

00:51:29.583 --> 00:51:32.338
sculptural program--
we're concerned here primarily

00:51:32.338 --> 00:51:35.333
with architecture--
but the sculptural program was

00:51:35.333 --> 00:51:38.244
very complicated,
but very interesting,

00:51:38.244 --> 00:51:42.164
and the figures were very
carefully aligned with one

00:51:42.164 --> 00:51:45.010
another to get the message
across.

00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:46.826
So as you looked at the temple,
you would have seen Mars Ultor

00:51:46.826 --> 00:51:47.780
in the center of the pediment.
 

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:50.360
If you were allowed to walk
into the temple,

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:51.840
which usually only the priests
could do,

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:55.389
you would see the cult statue
with Mars Ultor in the center

00:51:55.389 --> 00:51:55.880
there.
 

00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:59.362
There was an equestrian statue
that was put up,

00:51:59.362 --> 00:52:03.072
of Augustus in 2 B.C.,
when he was given the title

00:52:03.072 --> 00:52:07.010
Pater Patriae,
the father of his country.

00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:09.990
And then all along the
colonnades there would've been

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:14.463
statuary,
including an image of Aeneas on

00:52:14.463 --> 00:52:17.382
this side,
Romulus on this side,

00:52:17.382 --> 00:52:20.010
and the so-called summi
viri,

00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:22.538
the great men of Rome,
both Augustus' colleagues and

00:52:22.538 --> 00:52:25.300
also his rivals,
in their portraits on either

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:27.900
side: a kind of giant picture
gallery,

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:37.010
a giant portrait gallery of
Rome, of the great men of Rome,

00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:39.550
of the greatest men of Rome,
namely Augustus himself,

00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:43.280
and of his ancestry,
both divine and mythological,

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.530
via Aeneas and also Venus.
 

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:51.735
The second marble building that
I want to show you today is the

00:52:51.735 --> 00:52:56.811
famous Altar of Augustan Peace,
the Ara Pacis Augustae,

00:52:56.811 --> 00:53:00.001
which is one of,
if not my most favorite

00:53:00.001 --> 00:53:03.239
building and monument in Rome,
and one that I've had a

00:53:03.239 --> 00:53:05.889
personal obsession with my
entire scholarly life.

00:53:05.889 --> 00:53:09.295
I've written a lot on this
monument and have a lot of

00:53:09.295 --> 00:53:13.028
thoughts, which have changed
significantly over the years,

00:53:13.028 --> 00:53:15.650
about this very important
structure.

00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:18.628
We know about it--Augustus
tells us about the Altar of

00:53:18.628 --> 00:53:21.440
Augustan Peace himself in his
Res Gestae.

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:25.047
He tells us on his return--and
I'm quoting Augustus here,

00:53:25.047 --> 00:53:28.590
from the RG--on his
return to Rome from Spain and

00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:30.889
Gaul;
he had gone to Spain and Gaul,

00:53:30.889 --> 00:53:34.213
which were the western part of
the Empire, in order to make

00:53:34.213 --> 00:53:35.820
some diplomatic treaties.
 

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:38.039
"On my return to Rome from
Spain and Gaul,

00:53:38.039 --> 00:53:43.340
after successfully restoring
law and order to the provinces,

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:47.030
the Senate decided"
(and this happened in 13 B.C.)

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:50.670
"to consecrate the Ara
Pacis Augustae,

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:53.389
on the Campus Martius"
(the so-called Field of Mars,

00:53:53.389 --> 00:53:55.650
an area of Rome) "in honor
of my return,

00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:59.501
at which officials,
priests and Vestal Virgins

00:53:59.501 --> 00:54:03.010
should offer an annual
sacrifice."

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:06.690
We believe that the monument
being referred to here is the

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:11.114
one that you see now before you,
The Ara Pacis Augustae,

00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:15.070
made entirely of Luna or
Carrara marble,

00:54:15.070 --> 00:54:19.929
solid Luna or Carrara marble,
and even more of a marble

00:54:19.929 --> 00:54:22.715
building,
in a sense, than the temple and

00:54:22.715 --> 00:54:24.750
forum that we've looked at thus
far.

00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:27.860
It is a marble building that we
believe that we know.

00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:29.789
We know its dates quite
specifically.

00:54:29.789 --> 00:54:34.356
We know that it was consecrated
on the 4^(th) of July--an easy

00:54:34.356 --> 00:54:37.726
date to remember,
for all of us--the 4^(th) of

00:54:37.726 --> 00:54:39.150
July in 13 B.C.
 

00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:42.826
was when it was consecrated,
and it was completed and

00:54:42.826 --> 00:54:46.219
dedicated on the 30^(th) of
January in 9 B.C.;

00:54:46.219 --> 00:54:50.554
the 30^(th) of January just
happened to be the birthday of

00:54:50.554 --> 00:54:52.380
Augustus' wife,
Livia.

00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:53.739
No coincidence there.
 

00:54:53.739 --> 00:54:56.260
She was obviously lobbying for
that.

00:54:56.260 --> 00:55:00.579
So on her birthday,
30^(th) of January in 9 B.C.,

00:55:00.579 --> 00:55:03.280
this structure is dedicated.
 

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:09.173
We know that it--there's a lot
of controversy as to exactly

00:55:09.173 --> 00:55:13.849
what event is referred to on
this monument,

00:55:13.849 --> 00:55:17.367
because we'll see that there is
a procession that refers to some

00:55:17.367 --> 00:55:18.429
historical event.
 

00:55:18.429 --> 00:55:22.018
We will also see that the
monument is covered with all

00:55:22.018 --> 00:55:26.257
kinds of sculptural decoration,
including flowering acanthus

00:55:26.257 --> 00:55:28.277
plants,
including mythological and

00:55:28.277 --> 00:55:31.190
legendary scenes,
including historical scenes.

00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:35.016
And trying to decipher the web
of all these and their

00:55:35.016 --> 00:55:38.550
relationship to one another is
fairly complex.

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:41.409
What's important to us as we
look at this is--

00:55:41.409 --> 00:55:44.570
and I want to show you here,
from Ward-Perkins,

00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:48.360
a plan and an axonometric view,
which will give us a very good

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:50.909
sense of what this altar was all
about.

00:55:50.909 --> 00:55:55.476
We can see that the altar
proper was located in the center

00:55:55.476 --> 00:55:57.000
of the structure.
 

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.094
It's a kind of u-shaped altar,
which goes back to Greek

00:56:00.094 --> 00:56:00.840
precedents.
 

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:04.530
The most famous u-shaped altar
of the Hellenistic period,

00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:09.369
some of you may know it,
the Altar of Zeus at Pergamon,

00:56:09.369 --> 00:56:10.800
the great Altar of Zeus at
Pergamon,

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.119
which you see in the uppermost
part,

00:56:12.119 --> 00:56:15.099
now in Berlin.
 

00:56:15.099 --> 00:56:17.248
But these u-shaped altars were
used in Greece,

00:56:17.248 --> 00:56:19.351
and you can see that same
u-shaped form here,

00:56:19.351 --> 00:56:20.449
used for the altar.
 

00:56:20.449 --> 00:56:22.625
The altar proper,
where the sacrifice was

00:56:22.625 --> 00:56:24.943
actually made,
is located inside this

00:56:24.943 --> 00:56:27.289
precinct, which is open to the
sky,

00:56:27.289 --> 00:56:31.601
and most importantly has double
doors: a doorway on the eastern

00:56:31.601 --> 00:56:35.496
side of the monument and a
doorway on the western side of

00:56:35.496 --> 00:56:36.679
the monument.
 

00:56:36.679 --> 00:56:39.952
Even though there are two
doors, you note that there is

00:56:39.952 --> 00:56:42.739
only a single staircase on the
western side.

00:56:42.739 --> 00:56:45.784
So the Romans,
despite the fact that they've

00:56:45.784 --> 00:56:50.246
given it a dual focus by putting
two doors, they still give it a

00:56:50.246 --> 00:56:53.010
single focus by a single
staircase.

00:56:53.010 --> 00:56:55.563
So facadism of Roman
architecture reigned supreme,

00:56:55.563 --> 00:56:56.710
as you can see here.
 

00:56:56.710 --> 00:57:00.476
The fact that there were double
doorways -- very significant,

00:57:00.476 --> 00:57:03.489
and we've tried to sort out why
that might be.

00:57:03.489 --> 00:57:06.318
There are two possible
precedents or two possible

00:57:06.318 --> 00:57:08.559
references that are being made
here.

00:57:08.559 --> 00:57:13.400
One, to a Greek altar,
a Greek fifth-century B.C.

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:16.061
altar, which shouldn't surprise
us since we've seen that

00:57:16.061 --> 00:57:18.579
Augustus is looking back at the
fifth century B.C.

00:57:18.579 --> 00:57:21.103
in Greece and mining it for
architectural ideas and

00:57:21.103 --> 00:57:21.860
associations.
 

00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:29.065
We see here what is a restored
view of the Altar of the Twelve

00:57:29.065 --> 00:57:31.302
Gods,
or the Altar of Pity,

00:57:31.302 --> 00:57:34.010
that was located in the Greek
marketplace,

00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:36.480
in Athens, the Athenian Agora,
the marketplace in Athens,

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.018
fifth century B.C.
 

00:57:38.018 --> 00:57:41.518
You can see that it consisted
of an altar in the center,

00:57:41.518 --> 00:57:44.219
with a precinct wall,
with double doorways,

00:57:44.219 --> 00:57:49.018
one on either side here,
and with relief sculpture.

00:57:49.018 --> 00:57:51.737
So it looks like that might
well be an important model,

00:57:51.737 --> 00:57:54.809
again not surprisingly since it
dates to the fifth century.

00:57:54.809 --> 00:57:57.315
But also important,
and I show you an image of it

00:57:57.315 --> 00:58:01.188
on a Roman coin here,
is the so-called Shrine of

00:58:01.188 --> 00:58:05.436
Janus--the two-headed god,
J-a-n-u-s, the Shrine of Janus,

00:58:05.436 --> 00:58:07.510
which we know is located in the
Roman Forum.

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:13.293
And tradition had it that when
the doors--because it had double

00:58:13.293 --> 00:58:14.974
doors;
well it had two sides because

00:58:14.974 --> 00:58:15.780
he was a two-headed god.
 

00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:17.340
So two sides,
both with doors,

00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:20.893
both with double doors,
and that when those double

00:58:20.893 --> 00:58:25.673
doors were closed,
it signaled that peace reigned

00:58:25.673 --> 00:58:28.070
throughout the Empire.
 

00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:31.422
And we know in the Res
Gestae, Augustus tells us

00:58:31.422 --> 00:58:34.340
that he closed the doors of the
Shrine of Janus,

00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:37.010
he brags, three times during
his reign.

00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:39.833
So it is very likely that the
double doors on the Shrine of

00:58:39.833 --> 00:58:42.106
Janus are referred to,
not surprisingly,

00:58:42.106 --> 00:58:44.530
in an altar that was put up to
peace,

00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:48.166
to the peace that Augustus
brought to Rome through his

00:58:48.166 --> 00:58:52.079
various military victories and
also through his diplomatic

00:58:52.079 --> 00:58:54.590
conquests,
his diplomatic treaties like

00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:56.809
the one that he signed in Spain
and Gaul.

00:58:56.809 --> 00:58:59.309
I want to take you quickly
through the monument--

00:58:59.309 --> 00:59:02.626
and keep in mind always that
it's made out of Luna or Carrara

00:59:02.626 --> 00:59:04.789
marble--
to show you some of the--this

00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:08.190
is not a course in sculpture,
so I'm not going to go into the

00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:11.094
sculpture in any detail,
but I want you to be aware of

00:59:11.094 --> 00:59:13.621
it because some of the motifs
are important in our

00:59:13.621 --> 00:59:15.579
understanding also of
architecture.

00:59:15.579 --> 00:59:19.010
We see here two views of the
altar.

00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:22.777
You see these winged lion
griffins that are very popular

00:59:22.777 --> 00:59:26.150
motifs in the Augustan period,
as well as the spiraling

00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:28.739
acanthus plant that was also
popular in Augustan times.

00:59:28.739 --> 00:59:33.539
A figural frieze that
represents the Vestal Virgins

00:59:33.539 --> 00:59:39.010
that were referred to as those
to which offerings are--

00:59:39.010 --> 00:59:41.429
the sacrifice is taking place
in part in honor of them.

00:59:41.429 --> 00:59:46.349
But we see here a sacrifice
itself where the animal victims

00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:49.489
are being brought in for
slaughter.

00:59:49.489 --> 00:59:53.170
We also see if we look
at--we're now inside the

00:59:53.170 --> 00:59:56.768
monument, we've looked at the
altar proper.

00:59:56.768 --> 01:00:00.724
If we look at the precinct
wall, the inside of the precinct

01:00:00.724 --> 01:00:02.219
wall,
we see that is very

01:00:02.219 --> 01:00:04.949
well-preserved,
and we see it is zoned,

01:00:04.949 --> 01:00:08.855
essentially two zones,
with slats, all done in Carrara

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:11.672
marble,
slats down below that look like

01:00:11.672 --> 01:00:15.599
either a wooden wall or perhaps
a fence of some sort.

01:00:15.599 --> 01:00:18.099
Then above, also depicted in
Carrara marble,

01:00:18.099 --> 01:00:21.907
these great garlanded swags
that you see hanging from

01:00:21.907 --> 01:00:24.387
pilasters,
but also from the skulls of

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:27.951
bulls--I'll show you a detail in
a moment where you'll see those

01:00:27.951 --> 01:00:30.574
skulls better--
the skulls of the bulls that

01:00:30.574 --> 01:00:32.639
have been sacrificed on this
altar.

01:00:32.639 --> 01:00:37.619
And then above the swags you
can see these libation dishes.

01:00:37.619 --> 01:00:40.228
And what has been
speculated--and I think it's

01:00:40.228 --> 01:00:43.650
ingenious on the part of the
scholars who first came up with

01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:46.706
this--
that what they think is being

01:00:46.706 --> 01:00:51.489
represented here is actually a
copy or a rendition of the

01:00:51.489 --> 01:00:53.804
wooden,
the temporary wooden altar that

01:00:53.804 --> 01:00:55.090
would've stood on this site.
 

01:00:55.090 --> 01:00:58.268
Because remember they're
consecrating it already in 13

01:00:58.268 --> 01:01:00.902
B.C.,
but the structure itself isn't

01:01:00.902 --> 01:01:03.340
built until 9,
and they have to keep offering

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:04.329
this annual sacrifice.
 

01:01:04.329 --> 01:01:07.010
So they have to offer it
somewhere.

01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:09.130
So the suggestion is they made
a makeshift wooden altar,

01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:12.139
that looked like this,
with actual wooden slats,

01:01:12.139 --> 01:01:14.980
wooden poles,
real garlands and so on,

01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:19.510
and that what they've done on
the altar is to create a

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:24.043
rendition of that on the
interior precinct wall of the

01:01:24.043 --> 01:01:25.239
Ara Pacis.
 

01:01:25.239 --> 01:01:26.829
A detail of these garlands.
 

01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:29.543
Here you can see the bull
skulls or bucrania

01:01:29.543 --> 01:01:31.614
extremely well,
and I thought you'd be

01:01:31.614 --> 01:01:34.074
interested to see,
and perhaps not surprised,

01:01:34.074 --> 01:01:37.007
that we can see very close
renditions of this also in

01:01:37.007 --> 01:01:38.360
painting of the time.
 

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:42.179
This painting on the left comes
from the House of Livia in Rome.

01:01:42.179 --> 01:01:44.364
We didn't look at it;
we looked at the Villa of Livia

01:01:44.364 --> 01:01:46.409
at Primaporta,
and we looked at Augustus'

01:01:46.409 --> 01:01:49.552
house, but when we did that I
told you Livia had her own house

01:01:49.552 --> 01:01:51.460
across the street from
Augustus',

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:52.909
and this painting is from that.
 

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:56.681
It's clearly a Second Style
wall, residual First Style:

01:01:56.681 --> 01:01:59.400
done in paint;
projecting columns;

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.951
garlands hanging from those
columns, garlands interlaced

01:02:02.951 --> 01:02:05.340
with ribbons,
just as you see here.

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:08.704
And when this was painted,
which it was in antiquity,

01:02:08.704 --> 01:02:12.521
it would've looked very similar
to what you see on the other

01:02:12.521 --> 01:02:14.010
side of the screen.
 

01:02:14.010 --> 01:02:16.416
So interesting
inter-relationships between

01:02:16.416 --> 01:02:18.764
decoration in sculpture and
architecture,

01:02:18.764 --> 01:02:20.409
and decoration in paint.
 

01:02:20.409 --> 01:02:23.420
The axonometric view again
shows you--

01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:26.018
here's that inner precinct that
we've just described--

01:02:26.018 --> 01:02:28.840
that the outside had a series
of panels,

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:32.621
square panels,
four of them on the short sides

01:02:32.621 --> 01:02:35.010
and then--
or on the front sides,

01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:37.771
where the doors are,
flanking the doors -- and then

01:02:37.771 --> 01:02:40.469
on the other sides,
the north and south, a frieze.

01:02:40.469 --> 01:02:43.018
And I show you a detail of that
frieze;

01:02:43.018 --> 01:02:46.440
a frieze, the subject matter of
which is somewhat controversial.

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.239
I'm not going to go into that
here today.

01:02:48.239 --> 01:02:50.768
Suffice it to say though that
Augustus,

01:02:50.768 --> 01:02:54.570
senators, magistrates,
members of the priesthood,

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:57.981
members of the imperial family,
all take part in these

01:02:57.981 --> 01:03:01.460
processions that are located on
the north and south.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:05.480
Those processions rest on these
acanthus plants down below,

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.826
which when you think of it has
absolutely nothing to do with

01:03:08.826 --> 01:03:12.369
reality,
because how could a procession

01:03:12.369 --> 01:03:17.820
of human figures be supported by
acanthus plants below?

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:21.617
Impossible, and yet it is--some
of that fantasy thinking that we

01:03:21.617 --> 01:03:23.849
saw in Third Style Roman
painting,

01:03:23.849 --> 01:03:28.030
and I show you--I remind you of
a detail of Garden Room Q over

01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:29.786
here,
where we saw some of that

01:03:29.786 --> 01:03:33.449
fanciful Third Style painting,
seems to come into play here.

01:03:33.449 --> 01:03:37.090
In fact, the delicate acanthus
leaves, absolutely beautifully

01:03:37.090 --> 01:03:38.789
rendered in the Ara Pacis.
 

01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:43.818
You see the same sort of thing
in the black background of the

01:03:43.818 --> 01:03:45.159
Garden Room Q.
 

01:03:45.159 --> 01:03:48.547
So again, interesting
correspondences between painting

01:03:48.547 --> 01:03:50.530
and architectural decoration.
 

01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:54.090
The frieze on the south side
has a portrait of Augustus

01:03:54.090 --> 01:03:54.750
himself.
 

01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:58.630
You can see him here veiled,
taking part in this procession,

01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:01.327
as well as members of the
imperial family,

01:04:01.327 --> 01:04:02.840
including children.
 

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:07.130
Here's a little boy in a toga,
and here's a little boy who's

01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:11.130
very controversial in some kind
of a foreign costume.

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:14.099
And I mentioned that I've
written a lot on this,

01:04:14.099 --> 01:04:19.114
and in my most recent article
on this subject I talked in

01:04:19.114 --> 01:04:24.398
particular about these children
in foreign dress as possibly

01:04:24.398 --> 01:04:29.771
children who were what we call
"pledges of empire,"

01:04:29.771 --> 01:04:33.286
or hostage guests,
that belonged--that were

01:04:33.286 --> 01:04:36.157
children of very important
rulers of other parts of the

01:04:36.157 --> 01:04:39.400
world who were brought to Rome
to live with the emperor in his

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:40.724
house,
in the palace,

01:04:40.724 --> 01:04:42.436
to be trained,
with the objective of

01:04:42.436 --> 01:04:45.422
eventually sending them back to
their native lands to serve as

01:04:45.422 --> 01:04:46.010
rulers.
 

01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:49.529
It was Augustus' way of
creating a kind of hegemonic

01:04:49.529 --> 01:04:53.420
empire that he controlled,
by getting all of these people

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:56.824
on his side and then placing
those friends of Rome into

01:04:56.824 --> 01:04:59.409
important positions around the
world,

01:04:59.409 --> 01:05:02.119
and I think that's referred to
in these scenes.

01:05:02.119 --> 01:05:05.300
Again, I'm not going go in any
detail into the mythological

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.985
scenes,
but they are scenes like Roma,

01:05:07.985 --> 01:05:10.619
seated on a pile of arms and
armor,

01:05:10.619 --> 01:05:14.976
just as we saw her in the
pediment of the Temple of Mars

01:05:14.976 --> 01:05:15.610
Ultor.
 

01:05:15.610 --> 01:05:20.570
And here a scene that seems to
have shown Mars overseeing

01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:25.000
Romulus and Remus being suckled
by the she-wolf.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.414
So references to Rome's
historic and also legendary and

01:05:28.414 --> 01:05:31.260
mythological past clearly in
this monument.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:35.800
Perhaps most interesting to all
of us from the point of view of

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:39.902
architecture is the original
location of this monument in

01:05:39.902 --> 01:05:43.541
relationship to Augustus' tomb,
and also what has been

01:05:43.541 --> 01:05:46.545
happening there in recent years,
under the direction of the

01:05:46.545 --> 01:05:48.840
famous American architect
Richard Meier.

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:51.230
I show you a view from Google
Earth,

01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:53.753
an aerial view,
showing the Mausoleum of

01:05:53.753 --> 01:05:56.114
Augustus,
this large round tomb that we

01:05:56.114 --> 01:05:59.610
will look at on Thursday,
showing a piazza around it,

01:05:59.610 --> 01:06:01.777
and showing,
from the air,

01:06:01.777 --> 01:06:06.762
the Richard Meier Museum that
has been built to enclose the

01:06:06.762 --> 01:06:07.880
Ara Pacis.
 

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.710
This was not--right near the
Tiber River--this was not the

01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:13.739
original location of the Ara
Pacis, which was up over here.

01:06:13.739 --> 01:06:19.018
It ended up beneath a palace in
the Renaissance period,

01:06:19.018 --> 01:06:23.474
and at that time some pieces of
it were taken apart and made

01:06:23.474 --> 01:06:29.019
their way to museums in Rome,
but also to museums as far away

01:06:29.019 --> 01:06:30.030
as Paris.
 

01:06:30.030 --> 01:06:33.077
And it is actually to Mussolini
that we can be grateful for

01:06:33.077 --> 01:06:36.231
bringing all of those pieces
back together and reconstructing

01:06:36.231 --> 01:06:38.322
the Ara Pacis--
couldn't reconstruct it,

01:06:38.322 --> 01:06:40.190
because that palace is still
there now--

01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:42.590
but reconstructing it right on
the Tiber River,

01:06:42.590 --> 01:06:46.730
next to the Mausoleum of
Augustus, and then having this

01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:50.945
whole piazza redesigned as the
piazza honoring Augustus:

01:06:50.945 --> 01:06:55.010
the Piazza Augusto Imperatore
honoring Augustus,

01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:56.467
but also honoring Mussolini,
because there's a major

01:06:56.467 --> 01:06:58.923
inscription to Mussolini,
as well as buildings very much

01:06:58.923 --> 01:07:00.690
in the so-called Fascist style.
 

01:07:00.690 --> 01:07:03.820
We see the Meier building again
here.

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:07.791
And I show you the
travertine--because Meier was

01:07:07.791 --> 01:07:11.681
careful to use at least some
travertine in this

01:07:11.681 --> 01:07:16.103
structure--the travertine base;
although this was not his,

01:07:16.103 --> 01:07:19.088
this actually belongs to an
original precinct that was

01:07:19.088 --> 01:07:21.119
located before,
that was done by Mussolini's

01:07:21.119 --> 01:07:23.179
architect,
with the entire text of the

01:07:23.179 --> 01:07:24.340
Res Gestae.
 

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:28.532
Fortunately Meier kept that and
kept that wall as part of his

01:07:28.532 --> 01:07:29.579
own building.
 

01:07:29.579 --> 01:07:32.458
Here you see one of the Fascist
structures in the area,

01:07:32.458 --> 01:07:34.909
built by Mussolini,
and then the famous Alfredo

01:07:34.909 --> 01:07:35.710
Ristorante.
 

01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:37.820
I'm not actually recommending
it, but it's well known;

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.489
there are better restaurants to
eat in Rome,

01:07:39.489 --> 01:07:43.530
but because it has a certain
historical caché,

01:07:43.530 --> 01:07:46.018
at any rate I just mention to
you that it's there.

01:07:46.018 --> 01:07:48.918
This is the interesting
inscription that makes reference

01:07:48.918 --> 01:07:49.710
to Mussolini.
 

01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:51.449
And note the flying victory
figure,

01:07:51.449 --> 01:07:54.360
which we'll see decorates often
Roman arches,

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:56.789
carrying this bundle of twigs
and rods that the Romans,

01:07:56.789 --> 01:08:01.050
the Roman bodyguards of the
emperor used to carry,

01:08:01.050 --> 01:08:02.409
these so-called fasces.
 

01:08:02.409 --> 01:08:05.471
If you ever wondered where the
word Fascism comes from,

01:08:05.471 --> 01:08:07.739
it comes from the Roman
fasces.

01:08:07.739 --> 01:08:10.751
Mussolini's name,
you can see part of it here,

01:08:10.751 --> 01:08:15.400
M-U-S-S-O-L;
part of it scratched out after

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:19.979
his death and discredit in the
'30s.

01:08:19.979 --> 01:08:22.563
And then ultimately,
what's been interesting to me

01:08:22.563 --> 01:08:25.831
is I've watched this inscription
and photographed it year after

01:08:25.831 --> 01:08:27.359
year, whenever I'm there.
 

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:29.350
I've noticed recently that he's
having--

01:08:29.350 --> 01:08:32.390
there's something of a revival
-- and he is,

01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:34.750
Mussolini is having something
of a revival in Italy,

01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:37.408
and there's a good deal of
interest in him,

01:08:37.408 --> 01:08:41.182
and they have filled his name
-- when they redid the museum

01:08:41.182 --> 01:08:44.899
they also re-filled in his name,
as you can see here.

01:08:44.899 --> 01:08:47.867
I just wanted to make a point
about the siting of the Ara

01:08:47.867 --> 01:08:50.939
Pacis and its relationship to
the Mausoleum of Augustus.

01:08:50.939 --> 01:08:54.317
Remember, it's no longer--its
original location--now it's over

01:08:54.317 --> 01:08:57.029
here, right next to the
Mausoleum on the Tiber.

01:08:57.029 --> 01:08:58.578
That was not its original
location.

01:08:58.578 --> 01:09:02.310
It was located over here,
along the ancient Via Flaminia,

01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:06.310
the street that Augustus took
when he returned from Spain and

01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:06.908
Gaul.
 

01:09:06.908 --> 01:09:10.976
It was put up right here,
and it had in front of it an

01:09:10.976 --> 01:09:13.970
obelisk that was brought from
Egypt,

01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:18.260
and that obelisk was part of a
sundial that was orchestrated

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:22.405
carefully enough so that the
shadow from the sundial would

01:09:22.405 --> 01:09:25.970
fall exactly on the center of
the Ara Pacis,

01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:27.960
on Augustus' birthday.
 

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:30.118
That's how carefully
orchestrated it was,

01:09:30.118 --> 01:09:34.130
and the fact that there is an
Egyptian obelisk,

01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:37.061
and there's mention in the
inscription on that obelisk of

01:09:37.061 --> 01:09:39.210
the victory over Cleopatra and
Antony,

01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:42.030
at the Battle of Actium,
and that the Ara Pacis

01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:45.587
commemorates his diplomatic
treaties in the western part of

01:09:45.587 --> 01:09:47.828
the Empire,
in France and Spain,

01:09:47.828 --> 01:09:51.481
seems to me to be a reference
to the fact that Augustus was

01:09:51.481 --> 01:09:54.189
victorious in all parts of the
Roman Empire:

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:57.970
the western as well as the
eastern part of the Empire,

01:09:57.970 --> 01:09:59.140
referenced here.
 

01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:02.750
And then close proximity to the
Mausoleum of Augustus.

01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:06.229
Because we've already talked
about the fact that in the minds

01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:08.725
of the Romans,
victory in battle and victory

01:10:08.725 --> 01:10:11.220
over death were essentially
synonymous;

01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:12.390
both of them referred to here.
 

01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:15.439
I'm not implying that this was
planned as a complex.

01:10:15.439 --> 01:10:18.474
The Mausoleum,
as we'll see on Thursday,

01:10:18.474 --> 01:10:20.029
dates to 28 to 23.
 

01:10:20.029 --> 01:10:22.260
It was built much earlier than
the Altar of 13 to 9.

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:26.384
But I think when they decided
to add the Ara Pacis to this

01:10:26.384 --> 01:10:28.470
complex,
there was a great deal of

01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:31.880
thought that was given to siting
it in relationship to the tomb,

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:34.710
and to thinking about the whole
as a complex,

01:10:34.710 --> 01:10:36.828
at least at that particular
juncture.

01:10:36.828 --> 01:10:38.680
And I show you two more
restored views,

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.868
where you can see the obelisk
and the way in which it cast--

01:10:41.868 --> 01:10:47.038
it served as a sundial--cast a
shadow toward the Ara Pacis.

01:10:47.038 --> 01:10:50.083
And then, even though this is a
little bit out of focus,

01:10:50.083 --> 01:10:53.238
the relationship of the very
large tomb to the obelisk and

01:10:53.238 --> 01:10:55.010
ultimately to the Ara Pacis.
 

01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:57.698
So an area that was not planned
as a complex but grew into one.

01:10:57.698 --> 01:11:01.905
An image of Mussolini,
a wonderful photograph of

01:11:01.905 --> 01:11:05.713
Mussolini,
visiting the Ara Pacis after it

01:11:05.713 --> 01:11:10.918
was restored and dedicated and
placed in a complex designed by

01:11:10.918 --> 01:11:12.368
his architect.
 

01:11:12.368 --> 01:11:16.144
And then an image down here of
Richard Meier,

01:11:16.144 --> 01:11:20.777
celebrating the cleaning and
placement of the Ara Pacis

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:24.380
inside the new museum designed
by him.

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:27.136
And in just a few minutes I'd
like to run through a series of

01:11:27.136 --> 01:11:27.550
slides.
 

01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:31.500
Because I think a particularly
interesting issue for all of us,

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:34.770
and one that I hope that we
will debate in the online forum,

01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:38.279
is the fact that the building
by Richard Meier,

01:11:38.279 --> 01:11:40.670
this museum,
which has been praised and

01:11:40.670 --> 01:11:44.243
maligned both,
this museum is the first modern

01:11:44.243 --> 01:11:49.090
building that has been put up in
the central core of Rome,

01:11:49.090 --> 01:11:52.944
since the time of Mussolini,
since Mussolini redesigned the

01:11:52.944 --> 01:11:56.801
Piazza Augusto Imperatore and
added some other buildings to

01:11:56.801 --> 01:11:58.529
the landscape of Rome.
 

01:11:58.529 --> 01:12:01.472
There are other--there are
buildings by major architects,

01:12:01.472 --> 01:12:02.840
including Meier himself.
 

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:06.962
Meier built a Jubilee Church a
few years--a number of years

01:12:06.962 --> 01:12:10.587
ago, and Renzo Piano,
and other architects have been

01:12:10.587 --> 01:12:12.010
working in Rome.
 

01:12:12.010 --> 01:12:14.896
But they are not--their
buildings are located on the

01:12:14.896 --> 01:12:18.407
outskirts, the sort of suburbs
of the city, and not in the city

01:12:18.407 --> 01:12:19.029
itself.
 

01:12:19.029 --> 01:12:20.948
This is the only new building
that has been added to the city.

01:12:20.948 --> 01:12:23.958
And you can see,
from this particular view,

01:12:23.958 --> 01:12:28.185
why some people think of it as
a kind of white elephant that

01:12:28.185 --> 01:12:31.408
really doesn't fit the tenor of
the city.

01:12:31.408 --> 01:12:34.439
And, in fact,
when it first opened in 2006--

01:12:34.439 --> 01:12:39.043
and I was there not long after,
and taking some photographs of

01:12:39.043 --> 01:12:43.194
some pictures of the building
that were outside that had

01:12:43.194 --> 01:12:45.469
been--
that graffiti had been added

01:12:45.469 --> 01:12:48.399
to, and they call it the Meier
"criminale."

01:12:48.399 --> 01:12:50.420
And over here,
this is my favorite,

01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:53.878
it says: "meglio gli
architetti di secoli fa,"

01:12:53.878 --> 01:12:57.528
meaning those architects of the
past were a lot better than

01:12:57.528 --> 01:13:00.029
Meier,
is the message here.

01:13:00.029 --> 01:13:03.131
So there are many people who do
not like this building,

01:13:03.131 --> 01:13:06.578
and I think a case can be made
with regard to the outside.

01:13:06.578 --> 01:13:10.380
There is a nod to ancient Rome
with the travertine wall that is

01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:12.279
outside and continues inside.
 

01:13:12.279 --> 01:13:16.130
But it's typical Meier white
glass,

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:19.010
and a lot of people--I don't
mind that sort of thing,

01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:21.177
but a lot of people feel that
it doesn't really suit the

01:13:21.177 --> 01:13:23.779
environment with the two Baroque
churches right across the way,

01:13:23.779 --> 01:13:27.060
and so on and so forth.
 

01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:28.390
So I think a case can be made
for the exterior.

01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:30.130
But when you enter into the
museum,

01:13:30.130 --> 01:13:32.819
and pay your fee,
and then go into the door,

01:13:32.819 --> 01:13:36.050
and into the Ara Pacis itself,
I have to say--

01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:40.930
and past the plaster casts of
Augustus and his family,

01:13:40.930 --> 01:13:44.520
that you can see lined up
against the travertine wall--

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.760
when you confront the building
itself,

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:49.547
in its new interior,
I have to say I'm very

01:13:49.547 --> 01:13:52.470
impressed and very moved by this
interior.

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:55.163
You've got the sort of egg
crate ceiling and these

01:13:55.163 --> 01:13:58.243
wonderful louvered windows that
allow you to see not only

01:13:58.243 --> 01:14:00.720
Mussolini's Fascist buildings
next door,

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:03.100
but also the Mausoleum of
Augustus,

01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:06.328
that it really--and the light
is superb,

01:14:06.328 --> 01:14:09.488
and it really does give you a
chance to see this altar in a

01:14:09.488 --> 01:14:11.560
way that it hasn't been seen
before.

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:14.159
And especially at night,
I enjoy seeing it at night,

01:14:14.159 --> 01:14:16.710
because as you go by it they
have it lighted up.

01:14:16.710 --> 01:14:19.420
As you drive by--one of the
greatest things to do in Rome,

01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:22.416
by the way, is late at night,
when all the traffic has died

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:24.711
down,
either by car or Vespa or

01:14:24.711 --> 01:14:26.969
whatever,
just get around the city,

01:14:26.969 --> 01:14:29.368
go from one part of the city to
another,

01:14:29.368 --> 01:14:31.520
which you can zip around late
at night.

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:34.792
And driving along Lungotevere,
the street along the Tiber

01:14:34.792 --> 01:14:37.318
River,
and seeing the altar,

01:14:37.318 --> 01:14:43.408
the Ara Pacis Augustae lighted
up inside the new Meier Museum,

01:14:43.408 --> 01:14:46.970
like a jewel in a jewel box,
I can't help but think Augustus

01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:50.650
is smiling somewhere to think
that everything he did to try to

01:14:50.650 --> 01:14:53.850
preserve his memory for
posterity has been done,

01:14:53.850 --> 01:14:57.926
and has been helped to a great
extent by the great American

01:14:57.926 --> 01:15:00.199
architect,
Richard Meier.

01:15:00.199 --> 01:15:01.079
Thank you.

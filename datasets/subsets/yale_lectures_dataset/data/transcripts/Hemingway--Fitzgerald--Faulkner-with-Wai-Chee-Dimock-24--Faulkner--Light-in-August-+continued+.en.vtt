00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:11.833
WAI CHEE DIMOCK: Just
getting started.

00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:15.500
And just want to remind you,
refresh your memory about what

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.100
we were talking about
before the break.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.733
So we were talking about
first, the concept of

00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:28.100
strangers and kindness of
strangers that Lena would be a

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.900
recipient of.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.567
And then we were talking about
neighbors and what could come

00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:41.600
to us from neighbors and
not always good things.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.233
And Hightower is a recipient of
the not always good things

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:48.267
coming from our neighbors.

00:00:48.267 --> 00:00:53.733
But Hightower, as we also know,
is very emphatic that in

00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:58.433
spite of what happens to him,
in spite of the beatings and

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:02.733
so on, that he's actually
surrounded by two people.

00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:14.667
So it really takes a tremendous
act of willpower to

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:16.567
be able to say that.

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:18.767
And so this is the quote
from Hightower.

00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:20.267
"They are good people.

00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:25.167
All that any man can hope for
is to be permitted to live

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:28.067
quietly around his fellows."

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:32.633
So it is a proposition, a
statement that really is sort

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:36.833
of thrown in our face and in
the face of all the things

00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:39.433
that have happened to him.

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:44.967
So today what I'd like to do is
to use race as a test case

00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:46.700
for Hightower's proposition.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.800
We all know that Joe Christmas
is someone whose racial

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.567
identity is ambiguous, I would
say, from beginning to end.

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:58.233
We don't really know for sure
what his parentage --

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:05.367
we have good guesses, but
we don't know for sure.

00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:08.933
And we certainly don't know the
genetic makeup of someone

00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:10.000
like Joe Christmas.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.100
So in that context, I think it's
especially relevant to

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.400
talk about some of
the contemporary

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.867
discussion of race.

00:02:19.867 --> 00:02:23.400
And this is not even so new.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.100
It came out in 2003.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.733
It was a special issue of
Scientific American, whether

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:30.833
race exists,

00:02:30.833 --> 00:02:35.367
and it makes a strong argument
that race is misleading in the

00:02:35.367 --> 00:02:38.600
sense that when you look at the
physical characteristics,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.133
the facial features of people,
and we assume that race has a

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:47.133
very solid existence,
that is real.

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:49.767
But actually the facial
characteristics or the

00:02:49.767 --> 00:02:54.567
physical attributes do not
always correspond to our

00:02:54.567 --> 00:02:55.733
genetic makeup.

00:02:55.733 --> 00:03:00.900
So how people look actually is
not a great way to tell us who

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.600
they are biologically.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.267
And so the scientific argument
in the special issue or that

00:03:07.267 --> 00:03:12.400
essay is about the importance of
thinking outside of the box

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.667
of noticeable or observable
visible characteristics, to

00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:20.533
thinking about what would
come into play

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:22.100
in a medical situation.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.767
This is Scientific American
after all.

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:28.533
So this was back in 2003.

00:03:28.533 --> 00:03:32.333
And even earlier than that,
on the front cover of Time

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:36.533
Magazine, is the new
face of America.

00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:42.133
And it's really about America
becoming a mixed-race nation.

00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:46.367
And if that is the case, I look
at everyone, yeah, quite

00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:50.500
often I can't really tell what
background, ethnic background

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.733
people are from.

00:03:51.733 --> 00:03:53.267
And that is the case.

00:03:53.267 --> 00:03:56.200
This is a computer-generated
image.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.567
And we don't really know.

00:03:57.567 --> 00:04:01.833
She's made up of the traits
of many races, and so

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:02.633
it's hard to tell.

00:04:02.633 --> 00:04:06.767
But she's a very typical
American face.

00:04:06.767 --> 00:04:10.800
And around the same time, a
book came out by F. James

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.367
Davis called Who is Black?

00:04:12.367 --> 00:04:14.900
Actually this was quite an
important book when it came

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.933
out in 1992, to such an extent
that in its 10th anniversary,

00:04:19.933 --> 00:04:24.167
PBS actually did a special
program titled Who is Black?

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:26.200
and featured that book.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.000
And his argument is very, very
pertinent to Faulkner's novel.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.167
We don't actually know who
is black in this novel.

00:04:35.167 --> 00:04:37.900
So it is a question that
is not answered.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.967
And it's perhaps not meant to be
answerable, even at the end

00:04:41.967 --> 00:04:43.333
of the novel.

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:48.300
And this is an image
that actually Tai

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.967
used for her section.

00:04:49.967 --> 00:04:52.233
And it was a great section.

00:04:52.233 --> 00:04:54.900
I'm very happy to be there.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.467
So I just borrowed
it from her.

00:04:57.467 --> 00:05:04.200
And this is an Ebony Magazine
quiz, 1952.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.267
But even back in 1952, people
were realizing that if you

00:05:10.267 --> 00:05:11.900
look at people, you
don't really know

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.967
what race they are.

00:05:13.967 --> 00:05:16.200
And so I think that most people
would actually get a

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.333
few wrong answers
for that quiz.

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:24.200
So I think that all this is just
to set the stage for the

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.867
very complicated and maybe not
meant to be resolved landscape

00:05:30.867 --> 00:05:35.967
that Faulkner has set up for us
in Light in August. And so

00:05:35.967 --> 00:05:38.800
what I'd like to talk about
today is the word nigger.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.700
And of course, that's the word
that would have to be used.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.667
Because just as in the '50s,
the word negro was the

00:05:46.667 --> 00:05:49.600
standard term.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.633
In the '20s and '30s, "nigger"
would have been

00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:54.867
the standard term.

00:05:54.867 --> 00:05:57.300
So it was not originally
a racial slur.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.800
The use of the word "nigger,"
even though it wasn't

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.967
necessarily a racial slur,
it nonetheless

00:06:03.967 --> 00:06:06.800
was a charged epithet.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:13.433
It always has carried excessive
semantic burden.

00:06:13.433 --> 00:06:18.867
And because it carries excessive
semantic burden, it

00:06:18.867 --> 00:06:22.100
also opens itself up
to multiple uses.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.033
So today we'll look at the way
that word is being used by

00:06:26.033 --> 00:06:28.633
different people in different
contexts and

00:06:28.633 --> 00:06:30.367
for different purposes.

00:06:30.367 --> 00:06:34.500
So we'll go down the list. We'll
be talking about all

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.900
this, and also spoken
by other people.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:43.633
And also when the word is spoken
by the person himself.

00:06:43.633 --> 00:06:49.700
So I just noticed this
microphone has a way of

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.200
diminishing itself.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.500
So these are the people that
we'll be looking at who use

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.600
the word nigger.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.867
First is Joe Brown, and then
the dietitian a couple of

00:07:01.867 --> 00:07:05.333
times, and then Hightower, and
then Bobbie the waitress, and

00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:06.100
then Joanna Burden.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.567
And then Joe Christmas himself,
he uses the word

00:07:08.567 --> 00:07:10.467
nigger for himself.

00:07:10.467 --> 00:07:15.667
But first, let's look at the way
Joe Brown uses that word.

00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:17.233
At this point, Joe
Brown is being

00:07:17.233 --> 00:07:18.733
questioned by the sheriff.

00:07:18.733 --> 00:07:23.367
So we know that Joanna's body
has been discovered.

00:07:23.367 --> 00:07:26.200
Her house has burned down.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:31.933
And the sheriff is questioning
Joe Brown.

00:07:31.933 --> 00:07:37.433
And there's $1,000 that is
up for anyone who can

00:07:37.433 --> 00:07:38.800
help solve the case.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.933
So Joe Brown has sort of high
hopes that he'll be the one to

00:07:41.933 --> 00:07:42.900
get the $1,000.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.333
But as the sheriff questions
him, more and more comes out,

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:50.667
it seems less and less likely
that the $1,000 will be in his

00:07:50.667 --> 00:07:51.233
own pocket.

00:07:51.233 --> 00:07:52.667
So he's getting desperate.

00:07:52.667 --> 00:07:55.967
And that is when that
word comes up.

00:07:55.967 --> 00:07:59.733
"Because they said it was like
he had been saving what he

00:07:59.733 --> 00:08:03.367
told them next for just
such a time as this.

00:08:03.367 --> 00:08:07.067
Like he had knowed that
if come to a pinch"--

00:08:07.067 --> 00:08:09.467
this is Brian telling
Hightower--

00:08:09.467 --> 00:08:13.967
"like he had knowed that if it
come to a pinch, this would

00:08:13.967 --> 00:08:18.733
save him, even if it was almost
worse for a white man

00:08:18.733 --> 00:08:23.100
to admit what he would have to
admit than to be accused of

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.833
the murder itself.

00:08:24.833 --> 00:08:26.967
'That's right,' he says.

00:08:26.967 --> 00:08:27.667
'Go on.

00:08:27.667 --> 00:08:28.200
Accuse me.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.967
Accuse the white man that's
trying to help you

00:08:30.967 --> 00:08:31.700
with what he knows.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.967
Accuse the white man and
let the nigger go free.

00:08:34.967 --> 00:08:38.533
Accuse the white and
let nigger run.'"

00:08:38.533 --> 00:08:42.700
So this is the classic
race card that we

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.967
recognize so well.

00:08:44.967 --> 00:08:48.967
And unfortunately, it still
has some currency.

00:08:48.967 --> 00:08:53.400
So he's playing the race card,
because he's really desperate.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.967
What is really interesting is
how subtle this portrait, even

00:08:57.967 --> 00:09:01.600
of someone like Joe Brown
who has so little

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.000
saving grace to him.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.767
This is really someone who
is supremely unlikable.

00:09:07.767 --> 00:09:13.200
But even for someone who is
supremely unlikable, Faulkner,

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.500
nonetheless, portrays him as
someone who's not incapable of

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.167
feeling ashamed.

00:09:19.167 --> 00:09:24.333
So it is shameful, even for
someone like Joe Brown to use

00:09:24.333 --> 00:09:29.667
the race card, that when there's
nothing else he can

00:09:29.667 --> 00:09:31.833
do, he would do that.

00:09:31.833 --> 00:09:37.633
So he's not such a racist or
such a whatever that he's

00:09:37.633 --> 00:09:39.867
blind to what he's doing.

00:09:39.867 --> 00:09:43.267
And so I would say that even
though this is Joe Brown doing

00:09:43.267 --> 00:09:47.400
one of the despicable things
that he's capable of doing, in

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.367
the very act of doing that, he
recognizes completely that he

00:09:51.367 --> 00:09:54.267
is being despicable.

00:09:54.267 --> 00:09:57.500
So this is one kind of
self-contained usage of

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:02.000
shameful, and shameful even to
the person who is doing it.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.400
And the next couple
of usages all

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.833
revolving around the dietitian.

00:10:10.833 --> 00:10:17.700
And we know that Joe Christmas
is behind the curtains and

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.033
watching this whole scene
unfolding between the

00:10:22.033 --> 00:10:27.033
dietitian and her beau and
eating toothpicks and having

00:10:27.033 --> 00:10:29.333
no idea what's going on outside
of the dietitian

00:10:29.333 --> 00:10:31.367
thinking that he knows
everything.

00:10:31.367 --> 00:10:34.100
So she drags him out.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:38.467
And this is what Joe sees
when she drags him out.

00:10:38.467 --> 00:10:42.733
"A face no longer smooth
pink-and-white surrounded now

00:10:42.733 --> 00:10:47.033
by wild and disheveled hair
whose smooth band once made

00:10:47.033 --> 00:10:49.933
him think of candy. 'You little
rat!' the thin, furious

00:10:49.933 --> 00:10:52.100
voice hissed, 'You little rat!

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.967
Spying on me!

00:10:52.967 --> 00:10:55.733
You little nigger bastard!'"

00:10:55.733 --> 00:10:58.700
So she's never called
him that before.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:03.700
So it's at this moment of
extreme vulnerability on the

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.000
part of the dietitian
that that word would

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.633
come rushing up.

00:11:08.633 --> 00:11:14.433
So it has some relation to the
Joe Brown usage in the sense

00:11:14.433 --> 00:11:22.300
that this is a word that comes
out when your back is against

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.333
the wall, basically.

00:11:25.333 --> 00:11:28.967
This is the thing that
you fling at people.

00:11:28.967 --> 00:11:31.133
But the dietitian
actually is more

00:11:31.133 --> 00:11:34.433
resourceful than Joe Brown.

00:11:34.433 --> 00:11:37.667
She actually is able
to use that word

00:11:37.667 --> 00:11:39.600
in some other contexts.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.000
So this is the next installment
of the word nigger

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.633
coming out of the mouth
of the dietitian.

00:11:47.633 --> 00:11:53.433
And she has something else
to offer Joe Christmas.

00:11:53.433 --> 00:11:58.200
Her hand is outstretched, and
upon it lay a silver dollar.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:03.300
"Her voice went on urgent,
tense, fast. 'A whole dollar.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:03.767
See?

00:12:03.767 --> 00:12:05.100
How much you could buy.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.533
Some to eat every
day for a week.

00:12:07.533 --> 00:12:11.600
And next month maybe I'll give
another one.' He seemed to see

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.833
ranked tubes of toothpaste like
corded wood, endless and

00:12:15.833 --> 00:12:19.567
terrifying; his whole being
coiled in a rich and

00:12:19.567 --> 00:12:21.800
passionate revulsion.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.700
'I don't want no
more,' he said.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.833
'I don't ever want no
more,' he said.

00:12:25.833 --> 00:12:28.200
He didn't need to look
up to know what her

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.200
face looked like now.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.067
'Tell!' she said. 'Tell, then!

00:12:32.067 --> 00:12:33.367
You little nigger bastard!

00:12:33.367 --> 00:12:35.000
You nigger bastard!'"

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.933
So this is the evolution of the
dietitian, that she's not

00:12:39.933 --> 00:12:42.233
so vulnerable now.

00:12:42.233 --> 00:12:45.567
That she's actually on the
verge of going on the

00:12:45.567 --> 00:12:47.933
offensive, but not quite.

00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:50.667
Because she just wants
to make peace really.

00:12:50.667 --> 00:12:55.533
She has wanted to cut a deal
with Joe Christmas, basically.

00:12:55.533 --> 00:12:59.233
And so what she doesn't
understand is that he doesn't

00:12:59.233 --> 00:13:02.400
understand the concept
of bribery.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.433
Joe Christmas is really
interesting in that way.

00:13:05.433 --> 00:13:08.733
He doesn't always understand
kindness.

00:13:08.733 --> 00:13:12.567
And he even doesn't understand
the next thing down I think,

00:13:12.567 --> 00:13:14.967
which is bribery.

00:13:14.967 --> 00:13:18.967
So for him, the silver dollar
just means endless tubes of

00:13:18.967 --> 00:13:20.233
toothpaste.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.633
That can't be more
repugnant to him.

00:13:26.633 --> 00:13:31.233
But he knows enough to know
that rejecting that silver

00:13:31.233 --> 00:13:37.900
dollar would actually be an
automatic guarantee of the

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.900
appearance of that word
from the dietitian.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.533
So a pattern is beginning
to develop.

00:13:44.533 --> 00:13:48.667
First, complete vulnerability on
the part of the dietitian.

00:13:48.667 --> 00:13:54.033
Then not complete vulnerability,
but her scheme

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:57.500
is being foiled unwittingly
by Joe Christmas.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.000
And that word comes out again.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.067
So it's sort of a handy, part
involuntary, but part

00:14:04.067 --> 00:14:08.200
reflexive and part handy,
almost instrumental,

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.767
usage of that term.

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:14.600
And we'll move on now
to a completely

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.933
instrumentalized usage.

00:14:16.933 --> 00:14:19.700
So with the dietitian
it begins with a

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.633
non-instrumentalized
involuntary usage.

00:14:23.633 --> 00:14:27.567
By the third time she uses that
word, it is completely

00:14:27.567 --> 00:14:30.700
instrumentalized and completely
calculated.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.133
And that's when the dietitian
goes to the matron of the

00:14:34.133 --> 00:14:38.867
orphanage and uses that word,
"nigger," one more time.

00:14:38.867 --> 00:14:41.600
"'How did you know about this?'
The dietitian did not

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.233
look away. 'I didn't.

00:14:43.233 --> 00:14:45.067
I had no idea at all.

00:14:45.067 --> 00:14:47.767
Of course I knew it didn't mean
anything when the other

00:14:47.767 --> 00:14:51.300
children called him nigger.'
'Nigger?' the matron said.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.367
'The other children?' 'They
had been calling

00:14:53.367 --> 00:14:55.333
him nigger for years.

00:14:55.333 --> 00:14:58.533
Sometimes I think the children
have a way of knowing things

00:14:58.533 --> 00:15:03.133
that grown people of your
and my age don't see.'"

00:15:03.133 --> 00:15:07.300
Down to that little detail,
'people of your and my age.'

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.233
They actually are not
the same age.

00:15:09.233 --> 00:15:12.433
So when you have somebody
using that kind of

00:15:12.433 --> 00:15:17.267
construction, you just know
that they're highly

00:15:17.267 --> 00:15:21.133
manipulative and know exactly
what they're doing.

00:15:21.133 --> 00:15:28.500
So that little giveaway detail
at the end is basically just

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.967
the icing on the cake of this
racialization, this very

00:15:31.967 --> 00:15:36.700
deliberate racialization of Joe
Christmas in order to get

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.033
him sent away from
the orphanage.

00:15:39.033 --> 00:15:45.367
So the dietitian, I would say,
is probably right up there, in

00:15:45.367 --> 00:15:50.000
my mind, along with Joe Brown
in terms of unlikeability.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.133
But she is better, I think,
at what she's doing.

00:15:55.133 --> 00:16:03.033
So she succeeds in pinning that
epithet on Joe Christmas.

00:16:03.033 --> 00:16:07.700
And so this is really the first
thing that we should say

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:12.167
about that epithet is that it is
something that someone else

00:16:12.167 --> 00:16:13.433
pins on you.

00:16:13.433 --> 00:16:17.400
It doesn't really rule
from inside you.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.633
It is not a genetic attribute
about you.

00:16:20.633 --> 00:16:21.867
It's an attribution.

00:16:21.867 --> 00:16:25.600
It's not an internal genetic
congenital attribute.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:30.233
It is an attribution that
is foisted upon you.

00:16:30.233 --> 00:16:35.400
And that is what the dietitian
is doing right there.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:41.567
So that is the usage of the word
"nigger" on one side of

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:44.533
the spectrum, Joe Brown
and the dietitian.

00:16:44.533 --> 00:16:48.667
And now we'll move on to the
other end of the spectrum

00:16:48.667 --> 00:16:51.867
where there's sheer agony
to use that word.

00:16:51.867 --> 00:16:54.867
By the time the dietitian uses
the word the last time, she's

00:16:54.867 --> 00:16:57.467
actually very good at
what she's doing.

00:16:57.467 --> 00:16:58.967
It doesn't really touch
her anymore.

00:16:58.967 --> 00:17:02.233
She's completely distanced
herself and therefore able to

00:17:02.233 --> 00:17:03.633
manipulate that word.

00:17:03.633 --> 00:17:07.933
But here is, on the other side
of the spectrum, someone who

00:17:07.933 --> 00:17:10.800
simply cannot have that distance
from that word.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.933
And so it's an agonized usage.

00:17:12.933 --> 00:17:17.167
And this comes up in the context
of a conversation

00:17:17.167 --> 00:17:22.333
between Hightower and Byron.

00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:26.133
And Byron is telling him about
this new development--

00:17:26.133 --> 00:17:30.167
about burning down the house,
Joanna's body and so on--

00:17:30.167 --> 00:17:31.600
but also about Christmas.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.900
"'About Christmas.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.067
About yesterday and Christmas.

00:17:35.067 --> 00:17:37.267
Christmas is part nigger.

00:17:37.267 --> 00:17:41.967
About him and Brown and
yesterday.' 'Part negro,'

00:17:41.967 --> 00:17:43.700
Hightower says.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:47.733
His voice sounds light, trivial,
like a thistle bloom

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:52.133
falling into silence without a
sound, without any weight.

00:17:52.133 --> 00:17:54.500
He does not move.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.900
For a moment longer,
he does not move.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.867
Then there seems to come over
his whole body as if its parts

00:18:01.867 --> 00:18:05.667
were mobile like face features,
that shrinking and

00:18:05.667 --> 00:18:10.833
denial, and Byron sees that the
still, flaccid, big face

00:18:10.833 --> 00:18:14.200
is suddenly slick with sweat.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.200
But his voice is
light and calm.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.933
'What about Christmas and Brown
and yesterday?' he says.

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:28.600
So it is that utter disparity
between the bodily gesture,

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.467
the facial expression, the
bodily expression on

00:18:33.467 --> 00:18:41.533
Hightower, and the still
controlled, lightness of tone.

00:18:41.533 --> 00:18:45.833
That is what gives
Hightower away.

00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:52.300
That not only is the possibility
of Joe Christmas

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:56.467
being black, not only is it
the most terrifying of

00:18:56.467 --> 00:18:59.733
possibilities, but it's so
terrifying that he can't

00:18:59.733 --> 00:19:03.900
really afford to acknowledge
its gravity.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.533
So it's not just that it's just
terrible, but he can't

00:19:07.533 --> 00:19:08.833
even admit to it.

00:19:08.833 --> 00:19:13.667
It's that double combination
that suggests just how grave

00:19:13.667 --> 00:19:16.633
the situation is.

00:19:16.633 --> 00:19:19.100
Because Hightower knows exactly

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:19.933
what's going to happen.

00:19:19.933 --> 00:19:24.933
Once the question of race
comes into play, there's

00:19:24.933 --> 00:19:27.600
probably just one outcome.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.633
He knows it from his own
personal history from what has

00:19:31.633 --> 00:19:34.533
happened to him and to his
cook, and that was really

00:19:34.533 --> 00:19:35.967
nothing compared with this.

00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:40.500
So it's just a terrible
scenario, the endpoint of

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:44.100
which he can already see, and
that's why he's behaving in

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.167
this particular way.

00:19:46.167 --> 00:19:49.833
But there's also a point, kind
of a division, the lightness

00:19:49.833 --> 00:19:52.833
of tone and kind of the
involuntary shrinking and

00:19:52.833 --> 00:19:59.567
sweating and just kind
of devastation

00:19:59.567 --> 00:20:02.700
that's coming over Hightower.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.667
It points to the doubleness
of Hightower.

00:20:04.667 --> 00:20:07.767
And I think it's worth
talking about.

00:20:07.767 --> 00:20:09.467
This is a slight digression.

00:20:09.467 --> 00:20:13.767
But Faulkner's really very
emphatic about the two faces

00:20:13.767 --> 00:20:15.200
of Hightower.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.733
I think sometimes we tend to see
him too much as a victim,

00:20:18.733 --> 00:20:22.033
and certainly what's happened to
him invites us to think of

00:20:22.033 --> 00:20:24.800
him as just a victim of his
neighbor's violence.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.167
But Faulkner is empathic
from beginning to

00:20:27.167 --> 00:20:29.000
end that he is two-faced.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.967
"His face is at once gaunt at
flabby; it is as though there

00:20:32.967 --> 00:20:37.967
were two faces, one imposed upon
the other, looking out

00:20:37.967 --> 00:20:41.667
from beneath the pale, bald
skull surrounded by a fringe

00:20:41.667 --> 00:20:45.700
of gray hair, from behind the
twin motionless glare of his

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.500
spectacles."

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:50.533
Down to the twin glares of his
spectacle, to an earlier

00:20:50.533 --> 00:20:52.367
moment where everybody's coming
out of the church and

00:20:52.367 --> 00:20:54.800
the reporters were taking a
picture of him, and they took

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.167
picture of him from the side.

00:20:56.167 --> 00:20:57.933
He looks like Satan.

00:20:57.933 --> 00:21:02.133
Down to this moment when this
lightness of tone is belied by

00:21:02.133 --> 00:21:05.700
the involuntary shrinking
of his body.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.300
Hightower seems to be the
meeting place for two

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.400
contradictory impulses.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:15.133
And so we can also say that
metaphorically, he's also the

00:21:15.133 --> 00:21:19.767
meeting place for the goodness
of strangers and the brutality

00:21:19.767 --> 00:21:20.900
of the neighbors.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.800
He really is a kind of
unresolved meeting place for

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.067
those two cross-currents.

00:21:28.133 --> 00:21:32.267
But right now, right there
he's trying his best to

00:21:32.267 --> 00:21:35.400
trivialize that event in saying
that it really is

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.433
nothing at all.

00:21:36.433 --> 00:21:37.800
It is of no consequence.

00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:44.167
Coming now to Bobbie the
waitress, we'll look at one

00:21:44.167 --> 00:21:49.400
instance, another instance of
someone trying to trivialize

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:55.033
that fact, the possibility
that Joe could be black.

00:21:55.033 --> 00:21:58.967
So this is the two of
them lying in bed.

00:21:58.967 --> 00:22:01.800
And he makes this confession.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:05.900
"'I got some nigger blood in
me.' Then she lay perfectly

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.600
still, with a different
stillness.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.267
But he did not seem
to notice it.

00:22:11.267 --> 00:22:13.867
He lay peacefully too,
his hand slow up

00:22:13.867 --> 00:22:16.233
and down her flank.

00:22:16.233 --> 00:22:19.567
'You're what?' she said. 'I
think I got some nigger blood

00:22:19.567 --> 00:22:23.800
in me.' His eyes were closed,
his hand slow and unceasing.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.767
'I don't know.

00:22:24.767 --> 00:22:27.500
I believe I have.'
She did not move.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.767
She said at once, 'You're
lying.' 'All right.' he said,

00:22:30.767 --> 00:22:33.067
not moving, his hand
not ceasing.

00:22:33.067 --> 00:22:38.067
'I don't believe it.' her voice
said in the darkness."

00:22:38.067 --> 00:22:44.200
So I think that Faulkner is
going out of his way to make

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.800
this a very peaceful scenario.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:52.567
So this is the equivalent of
that lightness of tone that

00:22:52.567 --> 00:22:56.333
Hightower is using when he is
facing the possibility that

00:22:56.333 --> 00:22:57.733
Joe Christmas is black.

00:22:57.733 --> 00:23:00.867
And here, Joe Christmas is
making that confession

00:23:00.867 --> 00:23:03.733
himself, but really
he doesn't know.

00:23:03.733 --> 00:23:07.667
But all the emphasis here is on
how peaceful the scene is.

00:23:07.667 --> 00:23:08.800
He's just stroking her.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.967
He doesn't stop when he
makes that confession.

00:23:11.967 --> 00:23:16.167
So it's as if nothing
is happening.

00:23:16.167 --> 00:23:18.400
It wants to create the illusion

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.867
that nothing is happening.

00:23:19.867 --> 00:23:22.733
But actually, everything
is happening.

00:23:22.733 --> 00:23:27.300
So the waitress Bobbie's
reaction goes along with the

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:31.733
pretense that this is really
nothing at all.

00:23:31.733 --> 00:23:33.067
She's not going to
believe in it.

00:23:33.067 --> 00:23:35.600
There's nothing to it.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:40.633
But we also know that that takes
a lot of willpower, that

00:23:40.633 --> 00:23:42.733
that assertion, 'I don't
believe it' or

00:23:42.733 --> 00:23:43.467
there's nothing to it.

00:23:43.467 --> 00:23:45.133
You're just imagining it.

00:23:45.133 --> 00:23:48.133
All those statements actually
take a lot of

00:23:48.133 --> 00:23:50.167
willpower to say.

00:23:50.167 --> 00:23:56.500
And how superficial that the
assertion is becomes clear

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.600
when something else happens.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.333
And then Bobbie uses the word
nigger one more time.

00:24:03.333 --> 00:24:07.033
This time in a completely
different tone of voice.

00:24:07.033 --> 00:24:12.567
This is much later when Joe
has killed everything.

00:24:12.567 --> 00:24:16.533
He has killed his foster
father in the kitchen

00:24:16.533 --> 00:24:17.433
accidentally.

00:24:17.433 --> 00:24:20.633
And now he's going to see
Bobbie one more time.

00:24:20.633 --> 00:24:23.367
And now they know that they have
to leave, that they're in

00:24:23.367 --> 00:24:24.767
big trouble.

00:24:24.767 --> 00:24:28.900
So this is a moment of duress,
the equivalent of the

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.900
dietitian's duress,
the equivalent

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.767
of Joe Brown's duress.

00:24:33.767 --> 00:24:37.933
And this is what Bobbie
says under duress.

00:24:37.933 --> 00:24:41.033
"It was very much like it had
been in the school house,

00:24:41.033 --> 00:24:43.933
someone holding her as she
struggled and shrieked, her

00:24:43.933 --> 00:24:48.233
hair wild with the jerking and
tossing of her head, her face,

00:24:48.233 --> 00:24:52.633
even her mouth, in contrast with
the hair, as still as a

00:24:52.633 --> 00:24:55.300
bad mouth in a dead face.

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.833
'Bastard Son of a bitch!

00:24:56.833 --> 00:24:59.200
Getting me into a jam, that
always treated you

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.300
like a white man.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:04.767
A white man!' Perhaps Joe did
not hear her at all, nor the

00:25:04.767 --> 00:25:05.867
screaming waitress.

00:25:05.867 --> 00:25:08.200
'He told me himself
he was a nigger!

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.533
The son of a bitch!

00:25:09.533 --> 00:25:13.600
Me F-word for nothing a nigger
son of a bitch that would get

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:18.633
me in a jam with clodhopper
police.'"

00:25:18.633 --> 00:25:23.067
So this not by design.

00:25:23.067 --> 00:25:25.933
It is involuntary usage.

00:25:25.933 --> 00:25:31.000
But it is telling that that's
the word that always, or at

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.733
least every single one,
everything single character in

00:25:34.733 --> 00:25:36.500
Light in August would
reach for.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:40.533
That is the word that would come
involuntarily into our

00:25:40.533 --> 00:25:44.333
mouths when we are
under duress.

00:25:44.333 --> 00:25:49.633
It also says that no matter what
good intentions we have

00:25:49.633 --> 00:25:53.700
or how much willpower we hope
to bring to bear on a

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:58.833
racialized situation, that that
willpower is always going

00:25:58.833 --> 00:26:05.333
to be unequal to the terrible
weight, cementing weight that

00:26:05.333 --> 00:26:06.833
comes with that word.

00:26:06.833 --> 00:26:13.500
That every individual effort to
lighten or trivialize that

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:17.333
epithet, every attempt to make
light of it is going to fail.

00:26:17.333 --> 00:26:21.000
This is probably another
possible meaning for Light in

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.533
August that this is an attempt
of various people to make

00:26:24.533 --> 00:26:29.900
light of the phenomenon of
race and not succeeding.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:36.700
So Bobbie is, in that sense,
not even an especially

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:41.033
interesting character on her
own, other than as a kind of a

00:26:41.033 --> 00:26:45.267
dramatizing, concentrated
version of the sort of

00:26:45.267 --> 00:26:50.267
involuntary reactions and
involuntary usage of that word

00:26:50.267 --> 00:26:53.867
when we ourselves are
under duress.

00:26:53.867 --> 00:26:56.167
And all this really quite
marginal thing that

00:26:56.167 --> 00:26:58.033
Hightower--

00:26:58.033 --> 00:27:00.500
isn't all that marginal--

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:06.400
but his reaction, in many ways,
is an entry point to his

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.400
psychology.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:12.367
But there's one person for
whom the word "nigger" is

00:27:12.367 --> 00:27:17.767
front and center, and in many
ways she is more extreme to be

00:27:17.767 --> 00:27:19.567
a generalized case.

00:27:19.567 --> 00:27:27.400
So Faulkner uses Joanna Burden
as a fairly atypical case of

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:32.867
thinking, very emotional
response to the word "nigger."

00:27:32.867 --> 00:27:36.833
That it's, in many ways, on the
far end of the spectrum,

00:27:36.833 --> 00:27:40.167
that nonetheless reflects on
the medium, on the mean of

00:27:40.167 --> 00:27:41.267
that spectrum.

00:27:41.267 --> 00:27:45.500
But she has this very extreme
notion of what the word

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:50.733
"nigger" means, which is that
it is an eternal curse, and

00:27:50.733 --> 00:27:55.833
the context of which is the
death of her grandfather and

00:27:55.833 --> 00:27:59.833
her half-brother Calvin.

00:27:59.833 --> 00:28:04.100
So her grandfather and her
half-brother Calvin were

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.633
killed by a white person.

00:28:06.633 --> 00:28:08.733
They were killed by Satoris.

00:28:08.733 --> 00:28:10.133
So let's not forget
that they were not

00:28:10.133 --> 00:28:11.400
killed by a black person.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.500
They were killed by
a white person.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:18.700
But this is the account that
Joanna would give of the

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:22.200
reason why the two of
them are killed.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.700
This is what the father
says to her.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.833
"'Your grandfather and brother
are lying there, murdered not

00:28:30.833 --> 00:28:35.533
by one white man, but by the
curse which God put on a whole

00:28:35.533 --> 00:28:40.200
race before your grandfather or
your brother or me or you

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.133
were ever thought of.

00:28:42.133 --> 00:28:46.267
A race doomed and cursed to be
forever and ever a part of the

00:28:46.267 --> 00:28:49.500
white race's doom and
curse for its sins.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.467
Remember that.

00:28:50.467 --> 00:28:51.433
His doom and his curse.

00:28:51.433 --> 00:28:53.333
Forever and ever.

00:28:53.333 --> 00:28:53.767
Mine.

00:28:53.767 --> 00:28:54.733
Your mother's.

00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:57.333
Yours, even though
you are a child.

00:28:57.333 --> 00:29:01.267
The curse of every white child
that was born and that ever

00:29:01.267 --> 00:29:02.267
will be born.

00:29:02.267 --> 00:29:03.900
None can escape it."

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:09.000
This is about as thoroughgoing
a curse as could be.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
It's basically comprehensive,
cover all the bases.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.633
It covers every single member of
the white race, and it goes

00:29:16.633 --> 00:29:18.200
on for an eternity.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.333
That curse will never go away.

00:29:20.333 --> 00:29:25.067
So why is it that when two white
people are killed by

00:29:25.067 --> 00:29:27.900
another white person that that
is the case of the curse of

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.833
the black race?

00:29:29.833 --> 00:29:32.400
That is a really interesting
bit of logic.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.500
But Joanna's father is
firmly convinced

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.567
that that is the case.

00:29:37.567 --> 00:29:43.100
That if there had not been
blacks in this world--

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.433
which actually probably
would have been true--

00:29:45.433 --> 00:29:49.067
if there had not been blacks in
this world, the grandfather

00:29:49.067 --> 00:29:51.800
and Calvin would not have
been killed by Satoris.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.200
So even though it seems like a
strange kind of logic, once

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.767
you spell it out in that way,
actually it is a strange, but

00:29:58.767 --> 00:30:01.900
nonetheless truthful
statement.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:06.467
And this is how Joanna's
interpretation of that

00:30:06.467 --> 00:30:13.700
statement, her elaboration on
that image of race as an

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:17.733
eternal curse on the blacks,
obviously, but also on the

00:30:17.733 --> 00:30:19.233
whites as well.

00:30:19.233 --> 00:30:23.933
And given what her father
says, this is

00:30:23.933 --> 00:30:26.033
what she herself thinks.

00:30:26.033 --> 00:30:29.933
"But after that I seemed to see
them--" blacks-- "for the

00:30:29.933 --> 00:30:34.533
first time not as people, but as
a thing, a shadow in which

00:30:34.533 --> 00:30:39.367
I live, we lived, all white
people, all other people.

00:30:39.367 --> 00:30:42.800
I thought of all the children
coming forever and ever in the

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.533
world, white, with a black
shadow already falling upon

00:30:46.533 --> 00:30:48.767
them before they drew breath.

00:30:48.767 --> 00:30:50.967
And I seemed to see the
black shadow in

00:30:50.967 --> 00:30:53.033
the shape of a cross.

00:30:53.033 --> 00:30:56.967
And it seemed like the white
babies were struggling, even

00:30:56.967 --> 00:31:00.467
before they drew breath to
escape from the shadow, that

00:31:00.467 --> 00:31:04.633
was not only upon them but
beneath them too, flung out

00:31:04.633 --> 00:31:08.167
like their arms were flung
out, as if they were

00:31:08.167 --> 00:31:09.467
nailed to the cross.

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:13.467
I saw all the little babies
that would ever be in the

00:31:13.467 --> 00:31:17.567
world, the ones not yet even
born-- a long line of them

00:31:17.567 --> 00:31:21.500
with their arms spread,
on the black cross."

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:27.267
So this is a modern
interpretation of an entire

00:31:27.267 --> 00:31:29.267
race being crucified.

00:31:29.267 --> 00:31:34.233
And it turns out that according
to Joanna and her

00:31:34.233 --> 00:31:41.767
father that the dynamics of race
and the legacy of slavery

00:31:41.767 --> 00:31:51.733
is such that whites will be
crucified upon the black cross

00:31:51.733 --> 00:31:54.800
for as long as they live, for
as long as they are human

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.067
beings on earth.

00:31:56.067 --> 00:31:58.567
So it's an extravagant claim.

00:32:01.633 --> 00:32:07.667
And it's predicated on the
notion, and in some sense,

00:32:07.667 --> 00:32:12.300
it's a summary of all that we've
seen so far, which is

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:17.600
that the racial epithet is in
fact an epithet that all of us

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:22.667
reach for involuntarily when
we are under duress.

00:32:22.667 --> 00:32:27.000
So it's almost a kind of
psychological necessity for us

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.433
to call someone black.

00:32:30.433 --> 00:32:34.233
That all of us as human beings,
because all of us are

00:32:34.233 --> 00:32:38.900
under duress so much of the
time, there's just no way to

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:42.567
avoid being under duress
some of the time.

00:32:42.567 --> 00:32:44.600
Because there's such good
chances for all of us to be

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.000
under duress, there also good
chances for all of us to call

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.967
someone black.

00:32:49.967 --> 00:32:58.900
We just need to make that kind
of attribution on someone.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:05.467
And it's because of that basic
human psychological need that

00:33:05.467 --> 00:33:08.567
the relations between the
races-- so-called races, even

00:33:08.567 --> 00:33:10.567
though the membership of
each one is always

00:33:10.567 --> 00:33:12.067
going to be in flux--

00:33:12.067 --> 00:33:17.200
but the relation between the
supposed races, that relation

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.467
is always going to be fraught,
always going to

00:33:20.467 --> 00:33:22.867
be a terrible relation.

00:33:22.867 --> 00:33:26.500
And that's why, according to
Joanna, it's not just the

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:30.500
black shadow falling on white
babies, but she actually goes

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.400
so far as to say that
that shadow is

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.500
underneath them as well.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.033
This is an incredibly detailed,
all-encompassing

00:33:37.033 --> 00:33:39.467
black shadow that basically
envelops everyone.

00:33:39.467 --> 00:33:41.267
So it's on top of you.

00:33:41.267 --> 00:33:42.200
It's underneath you.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:46.100
You arms are flung out, and it
follows the shape of your

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.233
arms. Basically, it completely
envelops every inch of you.

00:33:50.233 --> 00:33:52.600
There's no escape from
that black curse.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.267
So this is really an
incredible claim.

00:33:56.267 --> 00:34:01.200
And I think that it's helpful,
in order to contextualize that

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.467
claim, to think about the
Burden genealogy.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.700
I'm sure Faulkner would object
to this kind of schematic

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:19.467
summary, but this is what we
have. The Burden geneaology

00:34:19.467 --> 00:34:23.000
starts up with someone called
Nathaniel Burrington.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.967
It's changed to Burden by
Calvin Burden who has a

00:34:27.967 --> 00:34:32.367
Huguenot Protestant
wife and friends.

00:34:32.367 --> 00:34:36.667
And then Nathaniel Burden joined
his father with two

00:34:36.667 --> 00:34:42.933
wives, the Mexican wife Juana or
Joanna, and a wife from New

00:34:42.933 --> 00:34:44.967
Hampshire who's Joanna's
extra mother.

00:34:44.967 --> 00:34:50.533
And then Calvin Burden, his
son, first son killed by

00:34:50.533 --> 00:34:52.000
Satoris along with
the grandfather

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
and then Joanna Burden.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.500
So this is the Burden
genealogy.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:01.700
And we'll see that two names
are being repeated twice.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:05.100
So the name Nathaniel
appears twice.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:08.700
And the name Calvin
appears twice.

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.533
Definitely Faulkner loves
to play with names.

00:35:11.533 --> 00:35:17.333
So this is another instance of
the nontrivial play with

00:35:17.333 --> 00:35:17.933
names,

00:35:17.933 --> 00:35:22.900
because we all know who Calvin
is, and he has everything to

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:26.667
say about original sin
and predestination.

00:35:26.667 --> 00:35:29.800
John Calvin right there, looking
like someone who would

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.167
make that kind of statement
about original sin.

00:35:33.167 --> 00:35:37.767
And this is his treatise,
Calvin, Institutes of the

00:35:37.767 --> 00:35:39.433
Christian Religion.

00:35:39.433 --> 00:35:44.033
And this is what he says
about original sin.

00:35:44.033 --> 00:35:48.867
"Original sin, therefore,
seems to be a hereditary

00:35:48.867 --> 00:35:54.233
depravity and corruption of our
nature, diffused into all

00:35:54.233 --> 00:35:59.300
parts of the soul, which first
makes us liable to God's

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.467
wrath."

00:36:00.467 --> 00:36:07.067
So it doesn't really actually
take the reprehensible action

00:36:07.067 --> 00:36:14.800
of anyone for us to be liable to
God's wrath, that actually

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.533
we inherit that.

00:36:16.533 --> 00:36:19.467
The important thing is that
it is hereditary.

00:36:19.467 --> 00:36:24.333
It is passed on from one
generation to another without

00:36:24.333 --> 00:36:29.800
the volition of the person upon
which it is visited and

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:34.500
without even necessarily any
reprehensible action on whom

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.433
that original sin is visited.

00:36:36.433 --> 00:36:39.900
It simply is something that is
passed on automatically from

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.500
one generation to another.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:46.533
So this a longstanding tradition
of thinking about an

00:36:46.533 --> 00:36:52.000
evil that we can't escape, that
we're just involuntarily

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.900
signed up on to this legacy of
evil and punishment and curse.

00:37:00.467 --> 00:37:04.067
I would say this is Joanna's
genealogy.

00:37:04.067 --> 00:37:08.400
And this is also partly
Faulkner's genealogy as well.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.633
I wouldn't say that he's a
Calvinist, but he's certainly

00:37:10.633 --> 00:37:14.900
very, very interested in this
kind of thinking, a curse that

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:19.000
is transmitted across time,
across generations.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.033
But there's another
party to this

00:37:23.033 --> 00:37:26.433
genealogy, Nathaniel Hawthorne.

00:37:26.433 --> 00:37:29.233
We already have seen how
important Hawthorne is.

00:37:29.233 --> 00:37:32.933
And it turns out he really is
a figure of longstanding

00:37:32.933 --> 00:37:35.100
relevance to Faulkner.

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.200
So the Hawthorne-Faulkner
connection.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:41.767
We know that in The Scarlet
Letter there's the Reverend

00:37:41.767 --> 00:37:46.000
Dimsdale who commits adultery
with Hester Prynne.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.400
In As I Lay Dying, there's the
Reverend Whitfield who commits

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.867
adultery with Addie.

00:37:51.867 --> 00:37:55.533
So Whitfield, Dimsdale, and
Whitfield actually making a

00:37:55.533 --> 00:37:59.367
speech that sounds almost like
Dimsdale's speech at the end

00:37:59.367 --> 00:38:00.867
of The Scarlet Letter.

00:38:00.867 --> 00:38:05.067
And then in Light in August,
the name Nathaniel is

00:38:05.067 --> 00:38:06.667
resurrected one more time.

00:38:06.667 --> 00:38:11.933
It's almost as if Faulkner's
just paying kind of this late

00:38:11.933 --> 00:38:14.167
tribute to an author who's
been very, very

00:38:14.167 --> 00:38:17.100
important to him.

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:28.433
And so given the fact that the
Hawthorne connection is

00:38:28.433 --> 00:38:34.533
actually a connection by way of
The Scarlet Letter, which

00:38:34.533 --> 00:38:40.633
is, in some sense, a novel not
just about sin, some kind of

00:38:40.633 --> 00:38:47.167
sin, past sin that Dimsdale
certainly can't shake off and

00:38:47.167 --> 00:38:51.267
maybe Hester can't shake off
either, a sin that will stick

00:38:51.267 --> 00:38:54.633
to you and follow you
wherever you go.

00:38:54.633 --> 00:38:57.533
It's not only just about that,
but it's also about sexual

00:38:57.533 --> 00:39:01.733
depravity or sexual license to
some extent, even though that

00:39:01.733 --> 00:39:06.467
is not represented at all in
The Scarlet Letter and not

00:39:06.467 --> 00:39:08.267
really represented
in any details.

00:39:08.267 --> 00:39:12.367
In both those novels, in both
The Scarlet Letter and As I

00:39:12.367 --> 00:39:16.433
Lay Dying, the sexual license
is only gestured at.

00:39:16.433 --> 00:39:20.933
We know the outcome of that
elicit sexuality in the sense

00:39:20.933 --> 00:39:24.467
that we see Hester's
illegitimate daughter Pearl in

00:39:24.467 --> 00:39:29.067
The Scarlet Letter, and we see
Addie's illegitimate son

00:39:29.067 --> 00:39:32.700
Jewel, and there's also a
connection between Pearl and

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:33.967
Jewel as well.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:41.467
We see Addie's illegitimate son
Jewel in As I Lay Dying.

00:39:41.467 --> 00:39:44.967
But in both those novels the
sexual license is not really

00:39:44.967 --> 00:39:45.433
represented.

00:39:45.433 --> 00:39:47.167
It's not part of the novel.

00:39:47.167 --> 00:39:53.167
In Light in August, actually we
do see that sexual license

00:39:53.167 --> 00:39:55.233
front and center.

00:39:55.233 --> 00:39:58.567
And what makes this even more
complicated is that it's

00:39:58.567 --> 00:40:02.267
mapped onto the platform
of race.

00:40:02.267 --> 00:40:09.533
So it is the weird combination
of belief in Calvinist

00:40:09.533 --> 00:40:16.767
original sin coupled with sexual
wildness on the part of

00:40:16.767 --> 00:40:18.400
Joanna Burden.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:22.333
And that is when the word
"negro" comes up.

00:40:22.333 --> 00:40:26.967
This is yet another of the
licentious context for the use

00:40:26.967 --> 00:40:29.167
of the word "negro."

00:40:29.167 --> 00:40:34.033
"Now and then she appointed
trysts beneath certain shrubs

00:40:34.033 --> 00:40:38.500
about the grounds, where he
would find her naked or with

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:41.900
her clothing half torn to
ribbons upon her in the wild

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:46.733
throes of nymphomania, her
body gleaming in the slow

00:40:46.733 --> 00:40:51.000
shifting from one to another
of such formally erotic

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.067
attitudes and gestures as a
Beardsley of the time of

00:40:55.067 --> 00:40:57.667
Petronius might have drawn.

00:40:57.667 --> 00:41:01.233
She would be wild then, in the
close, breathing halfdark

00:41:01.233 --> 00:41:04.267
without walls, with her wild
hair, each strand of which

00:41:04.267 --> 00:41:08.067
would seem to come alive like
octopus tentacles, and her

00:41:08.067 --> 00:41:10.667
wild hands and her breathing,
'Negro!

00:41:10.667 --> 00:41:11.267
Negro!

00:41:11.267 --> 00:41:12.467
Negro!'"

00:41:12.467 --> 00:41:15.833
So it might seem
incomprehensible that someone

00:41:15.833 --> 00:41:19.700
like Joanna Burden spends all
her time trying to help blacks

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:24.533
in the south, who is the on the
board of dozen charities

00:41:24.533 --> 00:41:27.600
and black schools--

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:31.833
basically has dedicated her
entire life to racial uplift--

00:41:31.833 --> 00:41:33.767
should be doing this.

00:41:33.767 --> 00:41:38.000
But I think that it actually
is, I think that as far as

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.433
Faulkner is concerned, this
incredible sexual license

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:47.000
actually goes hand in hand with
a belief in Calvinist

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.367
predestination.

00:41:48.367 --> 00:41:51.933
If you really believe that you
are going to be stuck with

00:41:51.933 --> 00:41:55.667
original sin, that that is going
to be upon you, that

00:41:55.667 --> 00:41:58.567
black shadow is going to be upon
you no matter what you

00:41:58.567 --> 00:42:01.600
do, then it doesn't really
matter what you do.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:05.700
It is a weird kind of
granting of license.

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:10.700
That if you're going to be evil
anyway, no matter what

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:13.167
you do, then you might as well
actually be evil in your

00:42:13.167 --> 00:42:14.567
conduct as well.

00:42:14.567 --> 00:42:15.733
There's something
of that logic.

00:42:15.733 --> 00:42:19.400
But I don't even think that
it's as logical as that.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.967
For Faulkner, it's just the
two sides of Joanna.

00:42:23.967 --> 00:42:30.667
And maybe just as Hightower has
two faces, Joanna clearly

00:42:30.667 --> 00:42:35.700
has two faces, and the whole
tradition, Calvinist

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:39.167
tradition, also has two faces.

00:42:39.167 --> 00:42:43.600
And that is really Faulkner's
contribution to thinking about

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:47.033
this particular kind
of theology.

00:42:47.033 --> 00:42:51.267
But we also notice is that
Faulkner tends to stick in all

00:42:51.267 --> 00:42:56.400
kinds of weird details into this
otherwise just kind of

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.667
full-dressed description
of sexual license

00:42:59.667 --> 00:43:00.633
on the part of Joanna.

00:43:00.633 --> 00:43:06.833
He also has weird kind of
references to two other

00:43:06.833 --> 00:43:07.600
traditions.

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.500
One is Beardsley and the
other is Petronius.

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.900
So this is Beardsley,
the famous

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:18.367
illustrator, Aubrey Beardsley.

00:43:18.367 --> 00:43:22.300
This is Salome, showing human
beings in this kind of very

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.500
erotic and wild gestures.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:30.700
This is another illustration
for Oscar Wilde's Salome.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:37.867
And as for Petronius, this is
actually not quite a novel.

00:43:37.867 --> 00:43:40.967
This is sort of a beginning
of a novel --

00:43:45.967 --> 00:43:49.033
Petronius, the writer
of Satyricon.

00:43:49.033 --> 00:43:55.367
The reason that it's related to
the Faulkner novels often,

00:43:55.367 --> 00:44:00.200
especially Light in August, is
that this early novel is about

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:04.300
two foreigners with
Greek-sounding names,

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:08.933
Encolpius and Giton
in Southern Italy.

00:44:08.933 --> 00:44:13.633
So this is the first instance
of northerners going south.

00:44:13.633 --> 00:44:15.700
Not quite Yankees
going south to

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:19.833
Mississippi, but similar
dynamics.

00:44:19.833 --> 00:44:24.600
And Joanna and her father and
the whole family knows that

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:27.267
they're hated as Yankees
and carpetbaggers as

00:44:27.267 --> 00:44:28.733
we've seen last time.

00:44:28.733 --> 00:44:33.267
So the whole dynamics of people
from one region going

00:44:33.267 --> 00:44:36.100
south and being hated
by the locals.

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:39.800
But in this case, there's this
additional complication.

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:44.300
That this is a very cold
northerner going to the hot

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:50.267
south, and in some instances,
being heated up by that

00:44:50.267 --> 00:44:52.333
tropical environment.

00:44:52.333 --> 00:44:55.967
But basically staying
cold and hot.

00:44:55.967 --> 00:45:02.300
So this is the pendulum swing of
Joanna from that incredible

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.167
sexual license to
the other side.

00:45:05.167 --> 00:45:09.967
And she also, interestingly
enough, she also uses the word

00:45:09.967 --> 00:45:13.633
"negro" in that context when she
swings to the other side.

00:45:13.633 --> 00:45:17.767
"She was sitting quite still on
the bed, her hands on her

00:45:17.767 --> 00:45:22.233
lap, her still New England face
(it was still the face of

00:45:22.233 --> 00:45:28.233
a spinster, prominently boned,
long, a little thin, almost

00:45:28.233 --> 00:45:33.433
manlike; in contrast to it her
plump body was more richly and

00:45:33.433 --> 00:45:37.267
softly animal than
ever) lowered.

00:45:37.267 --> 00:45:40.067
She said in a tone
musing, detached,

00:45:40.067 --> 00:45:43.233
impersonal, 'A full measure.

00:45:43.233 --> 00:45:45.900
Even to a bastard negro child.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:50.567
I would like to see father's
and Calvin's faces.'"

00:45:50.567 --> 00:45:53.667
The syntax I think is very
interesting, that what is in

00:45:53.667 --> 00:45:57.133
the parentheses, the still face
of the spinster and then

00:45:57.133 --> 00:46:02.233
the animal body, are kind of a
perfect summary of the two

00:46:02.233 --> 00:46:03.500
sides of Joanna.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.267
Even for Faulkner, it's
very ungainly syntax

00:46:09.267 --> 00:46:11.467
or deliberate syntax.

00:46:11.467 --> 00:46:17.233
And then that last part of that,
the bastard negro child.

00:46:17.233 --> 00:46:20.367
And is not accidental that
this is the moment where

00:46:20.367 --> 00:46:22.667
suddenly she's invoking
Calvin.

00:46:22.667 --> 00:46:26.067
I would like to see father
Nathaniel's face

00:46:26.067 --> 00:46:26.833
and Calvin's face.

00:46:26.833 --> 00:46:29.967
This is almost as if this is
the new twentieth century

00:46:29.967 --> 00:46:33.467
edition to The Scarlet Letter
and the new twentieth century

00:46:33.467 --> 00:46:36.167
edition to the longstanding
theology of Calvin.

00:46:36.167 --> 00:46:41.600
That this is what happens when
you inherit from those two

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:47.533
traditions is that you
both do good by

00:46:47.533 --> 00:46:49.967
supposedly helping blacks.

00:46:49.967 --> 00:46:56.833
But then you also engage in
this uncontrollable sexual

00:46:56.833 --> 00:46:59.133
orgy with them.

00:46:59.133 --> 00:47:08.033
And the bastard negro child is
this kind of also involuntary

00:47:08.033 --> 00:47:12.333
outcome of the union
of those two sides.

00:47:12.333 --> 00:47:17.000
And so it's sort of easy to see
why Joanna is not going to

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.367
be an easy person for Joe
Christmas to deal with.

00:47:21.367 --> 00:47:26.967
Anyone would have a hard time
trying to negotiate, trying to

00:47:26.967 --> 00:47:29.633
deal with someone like that.

00:47:29.633 --> 00:47:38.167
And Joe Christmas' response
is like this.

00:47:38.167 --> 00:47:41.033
At this point, Joanna wants
him to go to school.

00:47:41.033 --> 00:47:45.467
Wants him to study law with a
black lawyer and wants to turn

00:47:45.467 --> 00:47:49.567
over all her funds, all the
money that she has.

00:47:49.567 --> 00:47:52.100
And it's not insignificant.

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.833
She wants to turn over
all the money to him,

00:47:54.833 --> 00:47:57.100
and this is his response.

00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:00.100
"'To school.' his mouth said.
'A nigger school.

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:01.767
Me.' 'Yes.

00:48:01.767 --> 00:48:03.167
Then you can go to Memphis.

00:48:03.167 --> 00:48:05.367
You can read law in
Peebles' office.

00:48:05.367 --> 00:48:08.800
He will teach you law.' 'And
then learn law in the office

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.233
of a nigger lawyer,'
his mouth said.

00:48:12.233 --> 00:48:12.600
'Yes.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.700
Then I will turn over
all the business to

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:15.533
you, all the money.

00:48:15.533 --> 00:48:16.367
All of it.

00:48:16.367 --> 00:48:19.200
So that when you need money
for yourself, you could...

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:22.867
you would know how; lawyers know
how to do it so they...

00:48:22.867 --> 00:48:25.567
You would be helping them out
of darkness and none could

00:48:25.567 --> 00:48:28.867
accuse or blame you even if they
found out.' 'But a nigger

00:48:28.867 --> 00:48:33.867
college, a nigger lawyer,' his
voice said, quiet, not even

00:48:33.867 --> 00:48:36.633
argumentative; just promptive.

00:48:36.633 --> 00:48:39.833
They were not looking at one
another; she had not looked up

00:48:39.833 --> 00:48:41.300
since he entered.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:42.967
'Tell them,' she said.

00:48:42.967 --> 00:48:46.767
'Tell niggers that I'm
a nigger too?'"

00:48:46.767 --> 00:48:50.867
Especially this is a moment when
Joanna is both completely

00:48:50.867 --> 00:48:59.400
tone deaf, but also just an
incredibly sad person.

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:02.800
That this is the best
she can do for him.

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.200
She's too embarrassed.

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:06.600
She's trying to bribe
him as well.

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.533
She's trying to say I'm
going to turn over all

00:49:08.533 --> 00:49:09.300
the money to you.

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.933
And it really doesn't matter
if you study law.

00:49:11.933 --> 00:49:17.300
You know how to use the money
for your pleasure, really.

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:21.667
She can't really bring herself
to say that word.

00:49:21.667 --> 00:49:24.100
She wants to do the
most for him.

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.900
And she will not admit to it.

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:29.167
She would not name what she's
turning over to him.

00:49:29.167 --> 00:49:32.533
So all the ellipses of those
unfinished sentences.

00:49:32.533 --> 00:49:37.600
She's both tone deaf, but also
actually at the maximum point

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:42.433
of goodwill and love maybe even
towards him, wanting to

00:49:42.433 --> 00:49:44.967
do the most for him.

00:49:44.967 --> 00:49:52.167
And his way of responding is by
being totally ironic about

00:49:52.167 --> 00:49:57.867
the word "nigger" and obviously
about her as well.

00:49:57.867 --> 00:50:03.667
So I think that we can say when
the word "nigger" is used

00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:06.667
in that context, it's
also a moment of

00:50:06.667 --> 00:50:08.233
psychological duress.

00:50:08.233 --> 00:50:11.500
That maybe he just even can't
bear to acknowledge the fact

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:14.233
that she wants to do
so much for him.

00:50:14.233 --> 00:50:16.633
I think that that would be
one way to read that.

00:50:16.633 --> 00:50:20.633
That this is actually not a
moment when there's no love

00:50:20.633 --> 00:50:25.500
felt or that that
romance is over.

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:26.533
It's not that.

00:50:26.533 --> 00:50:28.367
But that maybe it's too much.

00:50:28.367 --> 00:50:32.367
And that the way that he's
responding to that is by being

00:50:32.367 --> 00:50:38.433
totally cynical, satirical and
ironic about the whole thing.

00:50:38.433 --> 00:50:42.500
So this scene is really open
to any number of readings.

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:46.333
All we know that it is
definitely not an innocent

00:50:46.333 --> 00:50:47.933
word when it's used
by oneself.

00:50:47.933 --> 00:50:53.767
That it is as charged and as
painful to use as when it is

00:50:53.767 --> 00:50:55.567
attributed to oneself
by other people.

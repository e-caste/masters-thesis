00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.040
PROFESSOR: OK, so as you know,
we've moved in our discussion

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.990
to the question of what sort
of social structures are

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.070
either legitimate or
contributory to the well being

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.730
of humans, given our nature.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.550
And we ended last lecture by
having a game theoretic

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.670
representation of what I
called the cooperation

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.620
dividend, which you'll recall
involves the case of two

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.870
individuals who, fearful that
the other will attack their

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.260
resources, expend a certain
amount of energy walling off

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
their goods.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.780
Where if they were somehow to
find themselves in a situation

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.270
where they could cooperate and
trust themselves to cooperate,

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.840
their energy could be devoted,
instead of to the protection

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.810
of their goods, to
the production of

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.390
other sorts of goods.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.540
Those required, as Hobbes says,
"for commodious living"

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.600
and for things like
navigation.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.680
Goods that would allow both
of them to be better off.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.760
And in the last two lectures we
looked at the writings of

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.520
Thomas Hobbes in the context of
his work, Leviathan which

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.460
explored both why it is that
the cooperation dividend is

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.100
expected to be to the advantage
of all and also why

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.380
it is that in order to hold
cooperation in place, certain

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.930
sorts of external enforcement
mechanisms--

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.010
in Hobbes's mind, a Leviathan,
a monarch or leader who has

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.720
absolute power--

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.160
is required to hold this sort
of cooperation in place.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.480
What we're going to turn to
in the lectures today and

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.670
Thursday is a contemporary
version of this question,

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.820
which asks us to think about--

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.480
if we are considering not merely
the cooperation or lack

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.020
of cooperation between two
people, but rather the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.320
distribution of goods and
responsibilities across a

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.610
larger community--

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.950
how it is that such a society
should be structured if we

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.660
take as our basic picture
something similar to Hobbes.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.050
Namely the idea that cooperation
is beneficial to

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.950
all in a way that competition
isn't, but that stably

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.950
promoting cooperation requires
certain sorts of

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.350
incentivizing.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.790
And so what we'll look in
particular today is discussion

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.170
by the 20th-century philosopher
John Rawls who

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.300
lived from 1921 to 2002 and
who taught at Harvard

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.210
throughout his career.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.280
We encountered Rawls writings
already in a very early paper,

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.180
the 1955 paper on punishment
that we looked at where he

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.370
introduced the idea of a
two-level justification of

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.450
punishment.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.120
And what we'll be looking at in
today's lecture is Rawls'

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.030
discussion in his enormously
influential 1971 book, A

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.630
Theory of Justice.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.870
So Rawls' Theory of Justice,
which in many ways brought

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.250
back into contemporary
philosophical discussion

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.250
consideration of a set of
questions which we traced all

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.190
the way back to Plato's
Republic --

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.710
why is it in people's self
interest to participate in a

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.330
societal structure --

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.820
and brought it back
in a way that

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.110
entered the public discourse.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.010
A Theory of Justice is the kind
of book that you'll see

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.750
cited in legal cases.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.460
You'll see it discussed not
merely in academic journals,

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.500
but also in intellectually
grounded conversations about

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.090
the legitimacy of the society.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.410
And A Theory of Justice begins
with these famous words.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.020
Rawls says, after saying what
he hopes to do in the book,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.230
that "Justice is the first
virtue of social institutions

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:57.140
as truth is of systems of
thought." He says, "Just as a

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.650
theory, however elegant and
economical, must be rejected

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.710
or revised if it's untrue, so,
too laws and institutions, no

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:14.050
matter how efficient or well
arranged, must be reformed or

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.510
abolished if they are unjust."

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:24.040
This is an articulation of what
Rawls sees as the central

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.710
commitment of a certain outlook
of the legitimacy of

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.880
government.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.190
A Western picture-- and perhaps
more general picture--

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.820
according to which, a social
structure, an arrangement of

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.650
fundamental institutions by
which lives are governed, is

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:53.430
legitimate if and only if the
institutions which it supports

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.590
are just.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.850
So just as a theory which is
extraordinarily elegant but

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.480
false should be rejected on the
grounds that it's untrue,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.160
so too, says Rawls, should a
societal structure which is

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.070
elegant but unjust
be rejected.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:25.390
He goes on to identify what he
sees as some fundamental

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.850
commitments of this
sort of picture.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:35.480
He writes, for example, that
"each person possesses an

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:41.000
inviolability founded on justice
that even the welfare

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.200
of society as a whole
cannot override.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.880
For this reason, justice
denies that the loss of

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:57.800
freedom for some is made right
by a greater good shared by

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.320
others."

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.280
Now we thought about
this question--

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.050
the question of the trade-off of
goods across individuals--

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.780
in the context of our discussion
of consequentialism

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:18.550
on the one hand and other moral
theories, deontology and

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.770
virtue theory on the other.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.270
What Rawls gives voice to--

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.250
both here and in sections 5 and
26 of Theory of Justice,

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.930
which I had you read --

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:36.700
is another reason related to the
reason that we read about

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.170
in Bernard Williams, this
idea of dignity.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:46.120
Another reason for rejecting as
a fundamental way of making

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:51.700
sense of human responsibility,
consequentialism as its

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.200
grounding basis.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.370
But what might not have been
apparent to you when we were

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:04.440
reading things like The Trolley
Problem, was the

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.740
connection of the outlook--

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.010
this idea that "each person
possesses an inviolability

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.130
founded on justice that even the
welfare society as a whole

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.919
cannot override," --

00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:24.080
and one of the foundational
documents of this nation.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:30.530
So among the truths that Thomas
Jefferson thought we

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:37.950
hold "to be self evident," is
that "all men are created

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:42.690
equal and that they are endowed
by their creator with

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:46.100
certain inalienable rights.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.680
And that among these," --

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.500
these rights such that even the
utility of society as a

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.090
whole is not sufficient
to override them--

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:02.230
"are life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness."

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:06.980
Moreover, you'll see in this
founding document--

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.550
this is of course the
Declaration of Independence--

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:16.590
that there is voice given to
exactly the contract-carrying

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:23.080
picture that we first recognize
in its inchoate form

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.280
in Glaucon's discussion of the
role of justice in Plato's

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:33.110
Republic and much more clearly
in the work of Hobbes.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.110
So listen to what comes next.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:43.020
"That to secure these rights,
governments are instituted

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:50.320
among men deriving their just
powers from the consent of the

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.490
governed." The idea that
entering into a social

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.900
contract with one another --

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:04.340
whereby as a way securing the
rights to life, liberty and

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:09.570
the pursuit of happiness, we
subject ourselves to a rule of

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.490
law, which we thereby take
to be legitimate --

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:18.180
is central, both to the social
contract tradition as

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.265
articulated in Hobbes and his
successors, Locke and Rousseau

00:10:22.265 --> 00:10:29.240
and Kant, and to this document,
which all of us have

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.260
presumably encountered
previously.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:39.270
Moreover, continues this
document, "whenever any form

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:44.800
of government becomes
destructive of these ends, it

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.840
is the right of the people to
alter or to abolish it and to

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.860
institute a new government."
What kind of new government?

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.990
What's Jefferson's answer?

00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:00.160
A new government, where "laying
its foundation on such

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.430
principles and organizing its
powers in such form as to them

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:10.060
shall seem most likely to
affect their safety and

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.640
happiness."

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:18.025
So the idea that we set out to
create a government that gains

00:11:18.025 --> 00:11:23.040
its legitimacy through our
recognition that thereby our

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:30.560
self-interest is advanced is a
central notion to the American

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.110
political tradition.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:38.800
So how does it manifest itself
in the particular text that

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.580
we're thinking about today?

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:48.090
How does John Rawls, in this
book from the 1970s, attempt

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:53.410
to give contemporary voice to
this set of concerns that 200

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.790
years prior to him were given
voice to by Thomas Jefferson

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:02.830
and 150 years prior to
that were given voice

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.920
to by Thomas Hobbes?

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.020
So Rawls begins by saying
what it is that he

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.920
takes society to be.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:17.060
Society, that which we're trying
to identify a set of

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.940
characteristics for, is "a more
or less self-sufficient

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:25.930
association of persons, who in
their relations to one another

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:31.470
recognize certain rules of
conduct as binding" and who,

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:36.480
"for the most part, act in
accordance with them." You'll

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.140
recall that at the end of the
Prisoners' Dilemma lecture

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:46.160
last week and also in our
readings for last Thursday, we

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.010
looked at mechanisms other
than the ones that Hobbes

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:56.350
identified for enforcing
social contract.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.540
Hobbes thought the most
effective way was the

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:04.280
imposition of a sovereign, whose
threat of penalty and

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.980
punishment would hold people
to behave in certain ways.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:15.920
But it turns out that in
addition to that, the taking

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:21.070
on implicitly through conscience
or habit of certain

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:27.760
kinds of norms of interaction
ends up playing as great if

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.400
not larger a role in allowing

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.980
societies to function smoothly.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.690
And in next Tuesday's readings
we'll look at some social

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:39.420
psychological work
that directly

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.580
addresses that question.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.570
So Rawls has told us what it is
that he thinks a society is

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:45.840
for the purposes
of discussion.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.790
It's "a more or less
self-sufficient association of

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.270
persons, who in their relations
to one another

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.680
recognize" something--

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.840
that is "certain rules of
conduct-- as binding" and,

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.060
"for the most part" -- not
always, I know some of you

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.000
talk on your cell phone
while you drive --

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.585
"act in accordance with them."
These rules "specify a system

00:14:09.585 --> 00:14:11.730
of cooperation that's designed"
to do what?

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.970
It's designed to do the thing
that Thomas Jefferson was

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:16.760
talking about in the
Constitution.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.920
It's designed to do the thing
that Thomas Hobbes was talking

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.210
about in Leviathan.

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.570
It's designed to do the thing
that Glaucon was talking about

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.660
in his challenge to Socrates.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:33.580
They specify "a system of
cooperation that is designed

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:38.450
to advance the good of those
taking part of it." The

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:44.340
legitimacy of government on this
picture derives from the

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:49.220
fact that it is to the advantage
of those who

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.430
participate in it.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.280
However--

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.850
and this is the perplexing
feature that makes political

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:03.950
philosophy a discipline of great
intellectual interest--

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:08.990
"although a society is a
cooperative venture for mutual

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:16.380
advantage," it is, says Rawls,
undeniably typically "marked

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.500
by conflict as well
as identity of

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.320
interests." Why is this?

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:27.610
It's because while there is
an identity of interests--

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:31.030
because social cooperation makes
possible a better life

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:35.540
for all than any would have if
each were to live solely by

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.990
his own efforts.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:41.600
That is, we get dividends as
the result of not having to

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.490
expend our energy on protecting
ourselves from the

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.120
threat of others' harm.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.140
Each of us-- as we know from
the last two lectures--

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:54.850
is better off when we can
count on others to be

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.350
cooperative.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:02.270
It is nonetheless the case that
there is a conflict of

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:09.820
interest in any society since
"persons are not indifferent

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:14.210
as to how the greater benefits
of their collaboration are

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.370
distributed."

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:25.670
Roughly speaking, each prefers
a larger to a lesser share.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:32.330
If there are cooperation
dividends, that is good and

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.920
produces a reason
for cooperation.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.910
But when there are cooperation
dividends, each of us--

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.770
reasonably enough--

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:48.569
wants as many of the dividends
as we can get.

00:16:48.569 --> 00:16:53.670
And the consequence of that is
that although "society is a

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:57.150
cooperative venture for mutual
advantage," it's typically

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:02.079
"marked by conflict as well
as identity of interests."

00:17:02.079 --> 00:17:08.140
So this gives rise to the
next level question.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:13.580
When we read Hobbes we read only
the very beginning of his

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.760
discussion of the social
contract, just a bit from the

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.800
end of book one and the very
beginning of book two.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.180
Rawls is now turning to a
question beyond that.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:33.300
Namely, what set of principles
ought we to adopt, given the

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.010
fact of conflict?

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:40.690
So we're taking it as a given
that we want cooperation, we

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.686
want some sort of societal
structure.

00:17:43.686 --> 00:17:47.070
As a result we're going to end
up with more stuff than we

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:50.410
would have had if we hadn't
been cooperating.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:56.110
How should that stuff, how
should those goods--

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:59.180
some tangible, some
intangible--

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.720
be distributed?

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:06.860
So Rawls points out that a set
of principles is required for

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:10.130
choosing among the various
social arrangements, which

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:14.910
determine this distribution
of advantages.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:20.010
These principles "provide a way
of assigning rights and

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:24.240
duties in the basic institutions
of society."

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.610
Things like what the legal
system looks like.

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.750
Things like what the economic
system looks like.

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.850
Things like what the fundamental
rights and

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:37.310
responsibilities of citizens
look like.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:43.580
And what they do it to define an
appropriate distribution of

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.570
benefits and burdens of
social cooperation.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:51.250
Because, as we've already noted,
social cooperation

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:56.010
brings with it undeniable
benefits but it also brings

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.850
with it several kinds
of burdens.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:01.960
Your freedom is restricted
in certain ways in

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.460
a cooperative system.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.476
And it may well be the case that
the benefits that accrue

00:19:06.476 --> 00:19:11.960
to the social system
go to someone else.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:17.350
So we're now at a point where
I will give voice to what

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:22.540
Rawls calls the main idea of
the theory of justice.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.600
And then I'm going to explain to
you how that fits with his

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.940
notion of the veil
of ignorance.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.460
And then just as your attention
is beginning to

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.010
flag, we're going to
do some clickers.

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:39.590
So hold up, a little more
fact and then some fun.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:43.130
So the main idea of The Theory
of Justice is, as I've pointed

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:46.680
out to you already, something
that is part of the social

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.720
contract tradition.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.645
Rawls explicitly says in the
first footnote of the text

00:19:50.645 --> 00:19:54.290
that we read for today that he's
working primarily from

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:58.450
the social contact picture as
articulated in Locke, Rousseau

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:02.150
and Kant, but that he
is harkening back

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:03.320
to Hobbes in it.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.110
And this, as you know, is the
following idea, that each of

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:11.360
us recognizes that there's a
certain advantage to living in

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:15.020
a society where we're not
constantly under threat, that

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.390
each recognizes that non-threat
can be achieved--

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.830
this idea that you're not
constantly at risk in this

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:23.140
cold war of all against all.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.520
But non-threat can be achieved
only under general

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.790
cooperation.

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:32.020
And that general cooperation
can be achieved only under

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:37.580
some sort of implicit or
explicit enforcement system.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:42.850
So Rawls, with that social
contract framework in mind,

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:53.040
goes on to ask, what would it
take to get a clear picture of

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:58.240
what that enforcement system
ought to look like if, as we

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.950
recall, it's meant to be
something, which is for the

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.080
good of each of its
participants?

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.570
And here is what he says.

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:12.880
He says, "The principles of
justice," of the basic

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:20.240
structure of society, "are those
that free and rational

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:26.440
person concerned to further
their self-interest would

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:32.380
accept in an original position
of equality as defining the

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:36.420
fundamental terms of
their association"

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.640
That is there are four
fundamental ideas that

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.960
underlie this picture.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.680
The rules that govern your
society, the rules that govern

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:54.210
a legitimate society, into which
you ought to contract,

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:59.880
are rules that you would accept
if you were free,

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:08.580
rational, self-interested and in
a position of equality with

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:14.095
respect to all of the other
free, rational and

00:22:14.095 --> 00:22:19.580
self-interested individuals who
are also contracting into

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.520
this society.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.940
How can we possibly get there?

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:30.440
How can we possibly determine
what free, rational,

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:35.110
self-interested and equal
individuals would agree to,

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:36.160
given that--

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.690
as a matter of fact--

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:39.460
we're not all equal?

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.110
Some of us were born into
families of wealth and some of

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:44.460
us were born into families
of poverty.

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.900
Some of us were born with
certain sets of natural

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.880
talents; others were born
with other sets.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.160
Some of us were born with
certain sorts of conceptions--

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.070
or some of us were raised
to have certain sorts of

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.710
conceptions--

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:56.700
of the good life.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.730
Others of us were raised
to have others.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:07.060
Rawls' idea is this: the
principles that articulate the

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:12.480
legitimate structure of society
are those to which you

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:20.140
would agree if you did not know
which person you were

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.930
going to be.

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:27.190
So he asks you to imagine that
you sit behind what's he

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:33.270
called a "veil of ignorance,"
where no one knows his place

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:38.240
in society, his class position,
his social status,

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.270
his fortune in the distribution
of natural assets

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:45.470
and abilities, his intelligence,
his strength or

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:49.040
his conception of the good.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:55.090
From this position, where you
don't know which person you

00:23:55.090 --> 00:24:00.670
are going to be, you get
the fourth of our four

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:02.190
requirements.

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:04.730
You get equality.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:09.970
Because nothing in particular
about your self-interest will

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:12.360
play a role.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:18.460
And having put yourself in this
imaginary position, where

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:23.910
ignorance brings with it a
certain kind of ability to

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:29.430
think clearly about the
question, each party then

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:35.440
freely determines on the basis
rational self-interest. So

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.740
that gives us freedom,
rationality and self-interest.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:45.320
The framework that they
think would be best.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:51.780
So the idea is this: a bunch of
people who don't know what

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:57.200
role they will play in society
sit behind the veil of

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:02.000
ignorance and think, how would
I want society to be

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.650
structured if I didn't know
whether I was going to end up

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:16.200
as a shepherd or a capitalist or
a doctor or a construction

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:23.820
worker or a police officer or
someone who has difficulties

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.730
with the authority of police
officers or somebody who's

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.240
differently abled or
perhaps even as a

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.226
Yale football player?

00:25:34.226 --> 00:25:39.170
And from behind this veil of
ignorance, recognizing that

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:46.390
any one of these identities
could end up being the one

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:52.830
that they would have, these
individuals come up with a

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:59.400
framework for how it is that
society would be structured.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:05.280
So recognizing that they might
be extraordinarily wealthy,

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.240
they may take into consideration
what it would

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.790
take for society to allow
individuals to flourish under

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.930
those conditions.

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:17.080
But they might recognize at the
same time that they might

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:21.532
end up as one of the
construction workers.

00:26:21.532 --> 00:26:23.810
Perhaps they would end
up as a doctor.

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:27.850
Perhaps the set of abilities
that they had would differ

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:32.760
from those of the majority
of the society and so on.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:39.200
So what you have in the
articulation of the veil of

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:44.490
ignorance as a way of thinking
about this question, is Rawls'

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:50.760
version of a theme that we have
seen over and over and

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.600
over again in this course.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:59.750
Hobbes says to you: When you
think about political

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:04.060
structures, think about
yourself as not being

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.830
different from everyone else.

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:10.130
Be willing, he says, "to lay
down your rights to the extent

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:12.470
that others are willing
to do this the same.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:17.370
Content yourself with as much
liberty against others as

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:21.140
others have against you."

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:26.140
Mill says, "Actions are right in
proportion as they tend to

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.800
promote happiness, wrong as
they tend to produce the

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.380
reverse of happiness.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:36.210
Not the agent's own happiness,
but the happiness of all

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:41.230
concerned." And Kant, again
giving voice to this idea: --

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:45.500
When you think from the moral
perspective do not think of

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.180
yourself as special. --

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:52.610
writes, "Act only in accordance
with that maxim

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:56.810
through which you can at the
same time will that it will

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:59.930
become a universal law."

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:05.680
So if you will take out your
clickers, we'll do three quick

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.250
exercises where we look
to see whether

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:13.240
Rawls's strategy works.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.030
So let me explain to
you how this goes.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:23.490
In this case, you are deciding
whether to enroll in one of

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:26.910
three sections of a course.

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:30.650
So the lectures of the course
will be identical

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:32.860
in all three cases.

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:39.860
But in option number one the
course has four excellent

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:42.590
sections, sections that
earn a 9/10 on

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:43.480
average student ratings.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:48.320
So four of the sections are
excellent and one of the

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.140
sections is terrible.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.550
And you don't know which
section you're

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:52.230
going to end up in.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.560
So in the first option you have
the choice of going to

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.280
the class and then you're going
to be randomly assigned

00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.630
to one of sections.

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:03.930
Four of them are excellent;
one of them is terrible.

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:08.325
The second option is that you
can take the course and four

00:29:08.325 --> 00:29:10.650
of the sections are
very good--

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:14.355
they gave a score of
7/10 on average--

00:29:14.355 --> 00:29:15.980
and one of the sections
in terrible.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.200
And you don't know which section
you're going to be in.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:22.360
So if you take that, you have
a 4/5 chance of being in a

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:26.050
very good section, but you have
a 1/5 chance of being in

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:27.075
a terrible one.

00:29:27.075 --> 00:29:31.480
And in the third version of
the course, four of the

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.935
sections are very good.

00:29:32.935 --> 00:29:34.280
They get a 7/10.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.670
And one of the sections
is so-so.

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:41.280
So the question is, which
course do you take?

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.940
Do you sign up for the course
that has four excellent and

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.510
one terrible section?

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:50.660
Remember you don't know which
section you'll be in.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.860
Do you sign up for the course
that has four very good and

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.190
one terrible section?

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:59.960
Or do you sign up for the course
that has four very good

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.770
and one so-so section?

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:05.770
So is everybody clear on the
structure of the question?

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.620
And I'll start the voting.

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:08.220
OK.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.900
All right, so let's go.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.150
Let's see.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.850
All right so, 60% percent
of you are with-- wow!

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:20.290
Where are my outliers?

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:20.610
Dudes!

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:21.970
Everybody understood!

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:22.470
Amazing!

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:23.290
We have never--

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.560
for those visitors who are
here-- we have never in this

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.420
class had 0% percent
of people choose my

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:29.990
obviously irrational choice.

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:33.330
So I'm glad to see that showing
off for non-Bulldog

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:35.280
days, people are doing
a good job.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.120
So roughly 60% of you
are risk-takers.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.750
You're willing to take the 1/5
chance of being in the

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:42.250
terrible class.

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:48.700
But 40% of you are risk-averse
in this context.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.120
Let's try it again.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:53.770
Exact same question,
different scenario.

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:58.490
So here's the scenario: you are
entering a housing lottery

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:02.850
and you can enter lottery one,
lottery two or lottery three.

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:07.020
Housing lottery one, there are
four excellent and one

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.940
terrible room.

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:12.650
Housing lottery two, there are
four very good and one

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:14.270
terrible room.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:18.380
And housing lottery three, there
are four very good and

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.350
one so-so room.

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:24.330
Again, you don't know where
you will end up.

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:27.830
Question, do you enter housing
lottery one, housing lottery

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:30.960
two or housing lottery three?

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.650
And let's set the timer.

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:39.720
Six, five, four, three,
two, one.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.880
And let's see what we get.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.380
So, ha!

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.990
You guys don't care about class
but you're very risk

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:50.260
averse on housing.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:57.140
So when it comes to your
well-being in terms of the

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:02.965
infrastructure in which you
live, 68% of you are willing

00:32:02.965 --> 00:32:07.270
to forgo the possibility of
an excellent room for the

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:13.780
certainty that you won't end up
in a room that is terrible.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:16.530
So let's try it one more time.

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:19.350
Now you're going
to a hospital.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:21.380
And here's the configuration.

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.950
Hospital one: four excellent,
one terrible doctor.

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:27.950
Hospital two, four very good,
one terrible doctor.

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:31.560
Hospital three, four very
good, one so-so doctor.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.350
You're asking the ambulance
to take you to the ER.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:38.700
You don't know which doctor
is on duty but you do know

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.620
Hospital one has four excellent,
one terrible.

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:44.110
Hospital two has four very
good, one terrible.

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:47.190
Hospital three has four
very good, one so-so.

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:53.910
And let's see how the numbers
come out on this.

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:57.540
So, four, three, two, one.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.320
And let's see where you
placed yourselves.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:04.880
So when it comes to high-stakes
medical decisions,

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:12.345
you are even more risk averse
than you were with housing.

00:33:12.345 --> 00:33:18.320
How much more important than any
of these local decisions

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:25.430
is the global decision, what
sort of societal framework do

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:31.600
you want around you if you don't
know what role you will

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.240
play in it?

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:39.670
So Rawls's question, which
society do you choose, is

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:44.060
meant to be a version of those
three questions, which I just

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.360
posed to you.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:51.810
Which medical system do you
choose if you don't know what

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:54.590
kind of individual you're
going to be?

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:59.560
And the answer was, you chose
one that topped out at very

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:03.980
good but bottomed
out at so-so.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:07.270
What housing system
so you choose?

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:10.370
What education system
do you choose?

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:15.790
Those were special cases of the
question Rawls is asking.

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:18.520
What society do you choose from

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.400
behind the veil of ignorance?

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:26.159
And Rawls is very clear that
the society that you choose

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:30.340
has two basic commitments.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:37.050
The first is that when we are
contracting into a social

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:43.610
framework that will govern all
aspects of our lives, the very

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:50.320
first condition is that within
that framework each person is

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:55.810
to have an "equal right to the
most extensive total system of

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:59.370
equal basic liberties that is
compatible with a similar

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:03.770
system of liberty for all." That
is, that each of us is to

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:08.990
have equal rights to vote,
rights to hold public office,

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:12.950
freedom of speech, freedom
of assembly, liberty of

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:17.200
conscience, freedom of thought,
freedom of person,

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:21.660
right to hold property and
freedom to be treated equally

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.920
with respect to the
rule of law.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.840
These, says Rawls, are
non-negotiable and they're

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:33.280
non-negotiable in the sense that
if we offered you, from

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:38.510
behind the veil of ignorance,
the possibility of trading off

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:43.310
some of these goods for the sake
of utility, if you did

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:47.310
not know which individual you
were going to be in that

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:52.590
society you would not
make that trade.

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:57.410
This is the way in which Rawls
attempts to derive those

00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:01.000
inviolable principles, which we
saw at the beginning of The

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:08.920
Declaration of Independence,
from the idea that these are

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:13.630
lines in the sand that would
be drawn in any social

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:18.850
framework to which free,
rational, self-interested,

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:22.146
equal parties would sign on.

00:36:22.146 --> 00:36:27.400
So that's Rawls's first answer
to the question, which society

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.690
do you choose?

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:33.140
You choose one that has a
non-negotiable baseline right

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:38.870
at the level of so-so or better,
with respect to these

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:40.940
fundamental liberties.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:46.540
These are things that don't get
traded off for anything.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.670
In addition--

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:50.760
and somewhat more
controversially--

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:57.590
says Rawls, you would, behind
the veil of ignorance,

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:03.740
subscribe to a societal
structure where the

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:10.000
distribution of social and
economic inequalities followed

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.060
a certain set of constraints.

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:18.550
The first is, to the extent
that social and economic

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:24.660
inequalities arise in that
society, they need to be

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:29.660
attached to positions and
offices that are open to all

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:34.610
under conditions of fair
equality of opportunity.

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:40.130
If attending an outstanding
educational institution will

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:44.560
increase the likelihood that you
can go on to have a job,

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:49.990
whereby you gain fulfillment
and earn a disproportionate

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:55.590
share of society's resources,
then it needs to be the case,

00:37:55.590 --> 00:38:00.550
says Rawls, that those
positions, those

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:08.360
opportunities, are open to all
regardless of contingencies of

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.140
circumstance that are irrelevant
to the possibility

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.270
of their making use of them.

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:18.990
In particular, your family's
financial resources shouldn't

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:26.320
play a role in your ability to
access these opportunities.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.680
So fair equality of opportunity
is the first

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:36.360
condition that Rawls thinks
needs to hold in order for

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:41.660
social and economic inequalities
to be acceptable

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:47.220
to you from behind the veil of
ignorance when you do not know

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.880
who you will be.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:56.310
In addition, and even more
controversially, Rawls thinks

00:38:56.310 --> 00:39:01.440
that behind the veil of
ignorance it would be agreed

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:09.690
by the parties that social and
economic inequalities would be

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:14.240
accepted as legitimate only
to the extent that those

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:18.940
inequalities are to the
advantage of all.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.940
And, in particular, to the
advantage of those who are

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:25.270
least well off.

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:30.940
So Rawls does not deny that a
rising tide lifts all boats,

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:35.290
that there may well be cases
where allowing discrepancies

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:41.050
in income or resources or
educational opportunities or

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:43.740
the quality of health
care would--

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.520
as a matter of fact--

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.890
lead everybody to
be better off.

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:53.440
Perhaps the fact that there are
research hospitals is of

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.690
great value, even to those who
don't have direct access to

00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:59.150
those hospitals.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:03.570
Nonetheless, it is because,
and only because, those

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:08.330
inequalities benefit the least
well off that Rawls thinks

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:13.880
they would be agreed to behind
the veil of ignorance.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:18.660
Moreover, Rawls thinks that
these principles, which I've

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:19.460
articulated--

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:22.370
the first principle, the equal
liberty principle, and the

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:25.190
second principle, which tells us
the conditions under which

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:27.070
inequality is legitimate--

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:31.130
are what he calls "lexically
ordered" so that no

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:34.690
utilitarian trade-offs
are permitted.

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:42.690
In particular, there is no
trading freedom for utility.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:49.330
If it would be advantageous to
society as a whole to engage

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:54.230
in a certain sort of racial
profiling, for example, to

00:40:54.230 --> 00:41:00.230
reduce crime but in so doing
the liberties of a certain

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:06.680
group would be impinged upon,
that utility consideration is

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:10.360
not sufficient, says Rawls

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:14.630
More over, as I've pointed
out, on Rawls's picture,

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:18.950
inequality is permitted only
when the advantage goes to the

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:21.000
least well off.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.415
So in the last three, four
minutes of class, I want to do

00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:26.030
two more polls with you.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:30.840
So if your clickers are
available, I want to see what

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.320
your thoughts are on this.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.760
And if your thoughts diverge
from Rawls, I'm going to give

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:40.240
you four places to identify
the locus of disagreement.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.170
So let's start with this.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:44.470
You're trying to choose
among societies.

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:50.975
Society one has an average
income of $100,000 and 85% of

00:41:50.975 --> 00:41:54.810
its citizens have the right to
vote and have freedom of

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:57.730
conscience and religion
and the like.

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:02.540
That is, this is a society in
which 15% of people lack basic

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:05.800
civil rights but the average
income is $100,000.

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:09.870
Society number two has an
average income of $70,000 and

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:13.320
15% of the people lack
basic rights.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:17.980
Society number three has an
average income of $70,000 but

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:22.170
100% of the people have basic
freedoms. You're behind the

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:23.250
veil of ignorance.

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:28.080
You do not know whether you
will be among the 15% in

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.030
society one or two.

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:35.170
As a matter of free, equal,
self-interested rationality,

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:37.880
which society do you choose?

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.190
One, two, or three.

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:42.360
And let's see how these
numbers come out.

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:51.520
It looks like the lexical
priority of the first

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:55.400
principle over the second is one
over which there isn't a

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.810
great deal of controversy.

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:01.580
Let's try the difference
principle.

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:02.910
Three societies.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:05.340
You don't know who
you will be.

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:07.640
Society one: average
income of $100,000.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.440
Lowest income: $10,000.

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:13.330
Society number two: average
income $70,000,

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:15.610
lowest income, $10,000.

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:18.940
Society number three: average
income is $70,000, lowest

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:20.240
income, $20,000.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.750
You do not know who
you will be.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:25.740
Which society do you choose?

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:28.465
And let's see how the
numbers come out on

00:43:28.465 --> 00:43:29.715
the difference principle.

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:37.250
OK.

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:39.960
So, still, huh.

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.690
Not as much difference
as I had expected.

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:47.610
Interesting to see, that most
of you-- even here--

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:50.160
are egalitarian.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:57.520
Averse to an increase in the
average if is at the cost to

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.650
the least advantage.

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:04.690
So for those of you who are in
the 27% here and for those of

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:07.960
you more generally who aren't
accepting the Rawlsian

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:12.060
framework, I want to point out
four different places where

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:16.090
you might be stepping
away from him.

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:19.640
The first is that you may
disagree with him about what

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.310
sorts of principles
would be chosen

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:23.210
behind the veil of ignorance.

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:25.710
You might think that
maximin reasoning--

00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:28.630
remember in section 26 he
says, behind the veil of

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:30.480
ignorance, people would
be risk-averse.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.520
They would distribute goods in
such a way that they benefited

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:35.810
the least well off.

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:38.610
So you might deny that behind
the veil of ignorance the

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:40.970
principles that Rawls
says would be

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:42.990
chosen would be chosen.

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:46.710
You might deny that it's the
choice that one make behind

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:49.520
the veil of ignorance that
represents what free, equal,

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.640
rational and self-interested
persons would accept as

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.410
fundamental terms of
their association.

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:57.040
That is, you might think the
veil of ignorance is not an

00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.250
effective device of
representation for answering

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:03.940
the question which Rawls
sets out to answer.

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:08.630
Or you might think that
what free, rational,

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:11.660
self-interested equal persons
would accept as fundamental

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:16.000
terms of association is what
the veil of ignorance gives

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:23.280
you, but that doesn't determine
what's just.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.760
Or you might think--

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:29.830
and we'll consider this answer
in our lecture on Thursday--

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:34.260
that it's not the case that
the first virtue of social

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.730
institutions is justice.

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:40.340
But rather that there are
other values even more

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:44.910
fundamental that lie at the
center of political

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:46.210
legitimacy.

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:47.830
And we'll turn to
that question in

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:50.870
our lecture on Thursday.

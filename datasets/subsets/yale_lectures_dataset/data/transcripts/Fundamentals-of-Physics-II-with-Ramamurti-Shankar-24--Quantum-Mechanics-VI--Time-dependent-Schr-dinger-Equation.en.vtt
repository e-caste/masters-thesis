00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.314
Prof: All right,
today's topic is the theory of

00:00:07.314 --> 00:00:09.770
nearly everything,
okay?

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.430
You wanted to know the theory
of everything?

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.940
You're almost there,
because I'm finally ready to

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.202
reveal to you the laws of
quantum dynamics that tells you

00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:24.210
how things change with time.
 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.700
So that's the analog of F =
ma.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.940
That's called the
Schrˆdinger equation,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.110
and just about anything you see
in this room,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.735
or on this planet,
anything you can see or use is

00:00:37.735 --> 00:00:41.964
really described by this
equation I'm going to write down

00:00:41.964 --> 00:00:42.720
today.
 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.338
It contains Newton's laws as
part of it, because if you can

00:00:47.338 --> 00:00:51.400
do the quantum theory,
you can always find hidden in

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.630
it the classical theory.
 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.054
That's like saying if I can do
Einstein's relativistic

00:00:57.054 --> 00:01:00.414
kinematics at low velocities,
I will regain Newtonian

00:01:00.414 --> 00:01:01.320
mechanics.
 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.120
So everything is contained in
this one.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.613
There are some things left,
of course, that we won't do,

00:01:09.613 --> 00:01:11.819
but this goes a long way.
 

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:14.754
So I'll talk about it probably
next time near the end,

00:01:14.754 --> 00:01:16.860
depending on how much time
there is.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.534
But without further ado,
I will now tell you what the

00:01:21.534 --> 00:01:25.310
laws of motion are in quantum
mechanics.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.030
So let's go back one more time
to remember what we have done.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.882
The analogous statement is,
in classical mechanics for a

00:01:36.882 --> 00:01:40.060
particle moving in one
dimension,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.068
all I need to know about it
right now is the position and

00:01:45.068 --> 00:01:46.410
the momentum.
 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.180
That's it.
 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.459
That's the maximal information.
 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.670
You can say,
"What about other things?

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.920
What about angular momentum?
 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.120
What about kinetic energy?
 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.470
What about potential energy?
 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.069
What about total energy?"
 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.970
They're all functions of x
and p.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.131
For example,
in 3 dimensions, x will

00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:05.063
be replaced by r, p
will be replaced by some

00:02:05.063 --> 00:02:06.867
vector
p, and there's a

00:02:06.867 --> 00:02:08.750
variable called angular
momentum,

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.222
but you know that once you
know r

00:02:11.222 --> 00:02:14.300
and p
by taking the cross product.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.490
That's it.
 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.002
And you can say,
"What happens when I

00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:23.460
measure any variable for a
classical particle in this

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.860
state, x,p?"
 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.325
Well, if you know the location,
it's guaranteed to be x

00:02:29.325 --> 00:02:31.575
100 percent,
momentum is p,

00:02:31.575 --> 00:02:32.550
100 percent.
 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.555
Any other function of x
and p,

00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:37.026
like r X
p, is guaranteed to have

00:02:37.026 --> 00:02:38.240
that particular value.
 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.258
So everything is completely
known.

00:02:40.258 --> 00:02:42.590
That's the situation at one
time.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.193
Then you want to say,
"What can you say about

00:02:46.193 --> 00:02:47.150
the future?
 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.240
What's the rate of change of
these things?"

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.352
And the answer to that is,
d^(2)x/dt^(2) times

00:02:54.352 --> 00:02:58.816
m is the force,
and in most problems you can

00:02:58.816 --> 00:03:02.468
write the force as a derivative
of some potential.

00:03:02.468 --> 00:03:05.942
So if you knew the potential,
1/2kx^(2) or whatever it

00:03:05.942 --> 00:03:06.974
is,
or mgx,

00:03:06.974 --> 00:03:09.568
you can take the derivative on
the right hand side,

00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:13.561
and the left hand side tells
you the rate of change of

00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:14.389
x.
 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:19.492
I want you to note one thing -
we know an equation that tells

00:03:19.492 --> 00:03:22.810
you something about the
acceleration.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.038
Once the forces are known,
there's a unique acceleration.

00:03:28.038 --> 00:03:31.914
So you are free to give the
particle any position you like,

00:03:31.914 --> 00:03:34.120
and any velocity,
dx/dt.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.759
That's essentially the momentum.
 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:38.060
You can pick them at random.
 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.580
But you cannot pick the
acceleration at random,

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.430
because the acceleration is not
for you to decide.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.953
The acceleration is determined
by Newton's laws to equal the

00:03:47.953 --> 00:03:51.020
essentially the force divided by
mass.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.885
That comes from the fact
mathematically that this is a

00:03:53.885 --> 00:03:56.967
second order equation in time,
namely involving the second

00:03:56.967 --> 00:03:57.780
derivative.
 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.128
And that, from a mathematical
point of view,

00:04:01.128 --> 00:04:04.055
if the second derivative is
determined by external

00:04:04.055 --> 00:04:06.990
considerations,
initial conditions are given by

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.568
initial x and the first
derivative.

00:04:09.568 --> 00:04:12.860
All higher derivatives are
slaved to the applied force.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.120
You don't assign them as you
wish.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.540
You find out what they are from
the equations of motion.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.800
That's really all of classical
mechanics.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.896
Now you want to do quantum
mechanics, and we have seen many

00:04:26.896 --> 00:04:29.675
times the story in quantum
mechanics is a little more

00:04:29.675 --> 00:04:30.528
complicated.
 

00:04:30.528 --> 00:04:34.279
You ask a simple question and
you get a very long answer.

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:36.617
The simple question is,
how do you describe the

00:04:36.617 --> 00:04:39.110
particle in quantum mechanics in
one dimension?

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.355
And you say,
"I want to assign to it a

00:04:41.355 --> 00:04:43.279
function
Y(x)."

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:48.634
Y(x) is any
reasonable function which can be

00:04:48.634 --> 00:04:52.769
squared and integrated over the
real line.

00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:55.500
Anything you write down is a
possible state.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.403
That's like saying,
any x and any p

00:04:58.403 --> 00:04:59.250
are allowed.
 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.629
Likewise, Y(x) is
nothing special.

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:04.872
It can be whatever you like as
long as you can square it and

00:05:04.872 --> 00:05:07.949
integrate it to get a finite
answer over all of space.

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.009
That's the only condition.
 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.252
And if your all of space goes
to infinity, then Y

00:05:13.252 --> 00:05:15.139
should vanish a and- infinity.
 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:16.920
That's the only requirement.
 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.360
Then you say,
"That tells me everything.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.028
Why don't you tell me what the
particle is doing?"

00:05:23.028 --> 00:05:24.966
And you can say,
"What do you want to

00:05:24.966 --> 00:05:25.579
know?"
 

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:27.829
Well, I want to know where it
is.

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:29.730
That's when you don't get a
straight answer.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.387
You are told,
"Well, it can be here,

00:05:31.387 --> 00:05:33.170
it can be there,
it can be anywhere else.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.785
And the probability density
that it's at point x is

00:05:37.785 --> 00:05:42.319
proportional to the absolute
square of Y."

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:44.446
That means you take the
Y and you square it,

00:05:44.446 --> 00:05:46.190
so it will have nothing
negative in it.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.687
Everything will be real and
positive, and Y itself

00:05:49.687 --> 00:05:50.750
may be complex.
 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.675
But this Y^(2),
I told you over and over,

00:05:53.675 --> 00:05:55.980
is defined to be
Y*Y.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.649
That's real and positive.
 

00:05:59.649 --> 00:06:01.451
Then you can say,
"What if I measure

00:06:01.451 --> 00:06:03.300
momentum, what answer will I
get?"

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.740
That's even longer.
 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.771
First you are supposed to
expand--I'm not going to do the

00:06:07.771 --> 00:06:11.348
whole thing too many times--
you're supposed to write this

00:06:11.348 --> 00:06:15.812
Y as some coefficient
times these very special

00:06:15.812 --> 00:06:16.930
functions.
 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.355
In a world of size L,
you have to write the given

00:06:20.355 --> 00:06:24.935
Y in this fashion,
and the coefficients are

00:06:24.935 --> 00:06:31.790
determined by the integral of
the complex conjugate of this

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:38.410
function times the function you
gave me, Y(x).

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.850
Now I gave some extra notes,
I think.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.610
Did people get that?
 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.819
Called the "Quantum
Cookbook?"

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:46.300
That's just the recipe,
you know.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.029
Quantum mechanics is a big fat
recipe and that's all we can do.

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:53.459
I tell you, you do this,
you get these answers.

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:57.120
That's my whole goal,
to simply give you the recipe.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.697
So the recipe says--what's
interesting about quantum

00:07:00.697 --> 00:07:03.807
mechanics,
what makes it hard to teach,

00:07:03.807 --> 00:07:08.677
is that there are some physical
principles which are summarized

00:07:08.677 --> 00:07:12.019
by these rules,
which are like axioms.

00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:15.346
Then there are some purely
mathematical results which are

00:07:15.346 --> 00:07:16.120
not axioms.
 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.149
They are consequences of pure
mathematics.

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:22.077
You have to keep in mind,
what is a purely mathematical

00:07:22.077 --> 00:07:23.956
result,
therefore is deduced from the

00:07:23.956 --> 00:07:26.478
laws of mathematics,
and what is a physical result,

00:07:26.478 --> 00:07:28.089
that's deduced from experiment.
 

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:31.951
The fact that Y
describes everything is a

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.430
physical result.
 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:39.122
Now it tells you to write
Y as the sum of these

00:07:39.122 --> 00:07:42.771
functions,
and then the probability to

00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:47.690
obtain any momentum p is
A_p^(2),

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.639
where A_p is
defined by this.

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:52.961
The mathematics comes in in the
following way - first question

00:07:52.961 --> 00:07:56.173
is, who told you that I can
write every function Y in

00:07:56.173 --> 00:07:57.100
this fashion?
 

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.529
That's called the Fourier's
theorem,

00:07:58.529 --> 00:08:01.850
that guarantees you that in a
circle of size L,

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.495
every periodic function,
meaning that returns to its

00:08:04.495 --> 00:08:06.932
starting value,
may be expanded in terms of

00:08:06.932 --> 00:08:07.879
these functions.
 

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:09.930
That's the mathematical result.
 

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.497
The same mathematical result
also tells you how to find the

00:08:13.497 --> 00:08:14.420
coefficients.
 

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:19.170
The postulates of quantum
mechanics tell you two things.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.704
A_p^(2) is the
probability that you will get

00:08:23.704 --> 00:08:27.028
the value p when you
measure momentum,

00:08:27.028 --> 00:08:27.709
okay?
 

00:08:27.709 --> 00:08:30.639
That's a postulate,
because you could have written

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:33.690
this function 200 years before
quantum mechanics.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.522
It will still be true,
but this function did not have

00:08:37.522 --> 00:08:41.649
a meaning at that time as states
of definite momentum.

00:08:41.649 --> 00:08:43.889
How do I know it's a state of
definite momentum?

00:08:43.889 --> 00:08:47.129
If every term vanished except
one term,

00:08:47.129 --> 00:08:50.255
that's all you have,
then one coefficient will be

00:08:50.255 --> 00:08:53.010
A something = 1,
everything is 0,

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.856
that means the probability for
getting momentum has a non 0

00:08:56.856 --> 00:08:58.980
value only for that momentum.
 

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:04.720
All other momenta are missing
in that situation.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.785
Another postulate of quantum
mechanics is that once you

00:09:07.785 --> 00:09:10.740
measure momentum and you get one
of these values,

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.178
the state will go from being a
sum over many such functions,

00:09:15.178 --> 00:09:20.208
and collapse to the one term
and the sum that corresponds to

00:09:20.208 --> 00:09:22.000
the answer you got.
 

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.109
Then here is another
mathematical result - p is not

00:09:25.109 --> 00:09:27.970
every arbitrary real number you
can imagine.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.730
We make the requirement,
if you go around on a circle,

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.509
the function should come back
to the starting value,

00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:35.801
therefore p is
restricted to be

00:09:35.801 --> 00:09:38.649
2p‚Ñè
/L times some

00:09:38.649 --> 00:09:39.950
integer n.
 

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.405
That's a mathematical
requirement, because if you

00:09:42.405 --> 00:09:45.169
think Y ^(2) is the
probability, Y should

00:09:45.169 --> 00:09:46.860
come back to where you start.
 

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.346
It cannot get two different
values of Y when you go

00:09:49.346 --> 00:09:50.220
around the circle.
 

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:55.519
That quantizes momentum to
these values.

00:09:55.519 --> 00:10:00.173
The last thing I did was to
say, if you measure energy,

00:10:00.173 --> 00:10:02.500
what answer will you get?
 

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.288
That's even longer.
 

00:10:05.288 --> 00:10:09.000
There you're supposed to solve
the following equations,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.977
(((h^(2)/2m)d^(2)
Y_E

00:10:13.977 --> 00:10:20.498
/dx^(2)) V(x))
Y_E(x) =

00:10:20.498 --> 00:10:24.408
EY_E(x).
 

00:10:24.408 --> 00:10:26.471
In other words,
for energy the answer's more

00:10:26.471 --> 00:10:29.110
complicated, because before,
I can tell you anything.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:32.038
I want you to solve this
equation.

00:10:32.038 --> 00:10:35.557
This equation says,
if in classical mechanics the

00:10:35.557 --> 00:10:40.101
particle was in some potential
V(x) and the particle had

00:10:40.101 --> 00:10:43.131
some mass m,
you have to solve this

00:10:43.131 --> 00:10:46.139
equation, then it's a purely
mathematical problem,

00:10:46.139 --> 00:10:49.268
and you try to find all
solutions that behave well at

00:10:49.268 --> 00:10:51.356
infinity,
that don't blow up at infinity,

00:10:51.356 --> 00:10:52.460
that vanish at infinity.
 

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.879
That quantizes E to certain
special values.

00:10:56.879 --> 00:11:00.653
And there are corresponding
functions, Y_E

00:11:00.653 --> 00:11:02.278
for each allowed value.
 

00:11:02.278 --> 00:11:05.378
Then you are done,
because then you make a similar

00:11:05.378 --> 00:11:08.919
expansion, you write the unknown
Y and namely some

00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:11.639
arbitrary Y that's given
to you.

00:11:11.639 --> 00:11:13.369
You write it as a
Œ£A_E

00:11:13.369 --> 00:11:15.809
Y
_E(x),

00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:18.759
where A_E is
found by a similar rule.

00:11:18.759 --> 00:11:21.892
Just replace p by
E and replace this

00:11:21.892 --> 00:11:23.808
function by these functions.
 

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:27.139
Then if you square
A_E you will

00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:30.399
get the probability you will get
the energy.

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:33.918
So what makes the energy
problem more complicated is that

00:11:33.918 --> 00:11:37.690
whereas for momentum we know
once and for all these functions

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:41.398
describe a state of definite
momentum where you can get only

00:11:41.398 --> 00:11:44.178
one answer,
states of definite energy

00:11:44.178 --> 00:11:47.610
depend on what potential is
acting on the particle.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.899
If it's a free particle,
V is 0.

00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:53.861
If it's a particle that in
Newtonian mechanics is a

00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:57.033
harmonic oscillator,
V(x) would be

00:11:57.033 --> 00:11:59.490
ÔøΩkx^(2) and so on.
 

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:02.967
So you should know the
classical potential and you've

00:12:02.967 --> 00:12:06.647
got it in for every possible
potential you have to solve

00:12:06.647 --> 00:12:07.250
this.
 

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.373
But that's what most people in
physics departments are doing

00:12:10.373 --> 00:12:11.379
most of the time.
 

00:12:11.379 --> 00:12:16.493
They're solving this equation
to find states of definite

00:12:16.493 --> 00:12:17.330
energy.
 

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.937
So today, I'm going to tell you
why states of definite energy

00:12:20.937 --> 00:12:22.080
are so important.
 

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.350
What's the big deal?
 

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.110
Why is state of momentum not so
important?

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.548
Why is the state of definite
position not so interesting?

00:12:28.548 --> 00:12:31.350
What is privileged about the
states of definite momentum?

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:35.629
And now you will see the role
of energy.

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:41.181
So I'm going to write down for
you the equation that's analog

00:12:41.181 --> 00:12:42.940
of F = ma.
 

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.759
So what are we trying to do?
 

00:12:44.759 --> 00:12:51.590
Y(x) is like
x and p.

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.798
You don't have a time label
here.

00:12:53.798 --> 00:12:57.316
These are like saying at some
time a particle has a position

00:12:57.316 --> 00:12:58.330
and a momentum.
 

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.807
In quantum theory or some time,
it has a wave function

00:13:00.807 --> 00:13:01.788
Y(x).
 

00:13:01.788 --> 00:13:04.123
But the real question in
classical mechanics is,

00:13:04.123 --> 00:13:06.903
how does x vary with
time and how does p vary with

00:13:06.903 --> 00:13:07.350
time.
 

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:10.960
The answer is,
according to F = ma.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.339
And here the question is,
how does Y vary with

00:13:13.339 --> 00:13:13.658
time?
 

00:13:13.658 --> 00:13:17.648
First thing you've got to do is
to realize that Y itself

00:13:17.648 --> 00:13:19.899
can be a function of time,
right?

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:22.984
That's the only time you've got
to ask, "What does it do

00:13:22.984 --> 00:13:23.908
with time?"
 

00:13:23.908 --> 00:13:27.149
So at t = 0 it may look
like this.

00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:29.149
A little later,
it may look like that.

00:13:29.149 --> 00:13:34.009
So it's flopping and moving,
just like say a string.

00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:36.745
It's changing with time and you
want to know how it changes with

00:13:36.745 --> 00:13:37.048
time.
 

00:13:37.048 --> 00:13:39.980
So this is the great
Schrˆdinger equation.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:44.292
It says i‚Ñèd
Y(x,t)/dt (it's

00:13:44.292 --> 00:13:46.998
partial,
because this depends on

00:13:46.998 --> 00:13:52.008
x and t so this is
the t derivative) = the

00:13:52.008 --> 00:13:57.860
following,
[-‚Ñè^(2) /2m

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:06.200
d^(2)Y/dx^(2) V(x)
Y(x,t)].

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.960
That's the equation.
 

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.610
x comma t.
 

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.730
So write this down,
because if you know this

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:21.504
equation, you'll be surprised
how many things you can

00:14:21.504 --> 00:14:22.519
calculate.
 

00:14:22.519 --> 00:14:25.363
From this follows the spectrum
of the atoms,

00:14:25.363 --> 00:14:28.735
from this follows what makes a
material a conductor,

00:14:28.735 --> 00:14:31.250
a semiconductor,
a superconductor.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:36.842
Everything follows from this
famous Schrˆdinger

00:14:36.842 --> 00:14:38.048
equation.
 

00:14:38.048 --> 00:14:41.039
This is an equation in which
you must notice that we're

00:14:41.039 --> 00:14:43.918
dealing for the first time with
functions of time.

00:14:43.918 --> 00:14:45.980
Somebody asked me long back,
"Where is time?"

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:49.009
Well, here is how Y
varies with time.

00:14:49.009 --> 00:14:53.227
So suppose someone says,
"Here is initial

00:14:53.227 --> 00:14:55.759
Y(x) and 0.
 

00:14:55.759 --> 00:14:59.153
Tell me what is Y a
little later,

00:14:59.153 --> 00:15:01.590
1 millisecond later."
 

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.479
Well, it's the rate of change
of Y with time multiplied

00:15:04.479 --> 00:15:05.379
by 1 millisecond.
 

00:15:05.379 --> 00:15:08.164
The rate of change of Y
at the initial time is obtained

00:15:08.164 --> 00:15:10.676
by taking that derivative of
Y and adding to it V

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:12.440
times Y,
you get something.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.899
That's how much Y
changes.

00:15:14.899 --> 00:15:17.320
Multiply by Dt,
that's the change in Y.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.360
That'll give you Y at a
later time.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.840
This is the first order
equation in time.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.620
What that means mathematically
is, the initial Y

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.070
determines the future
completely.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:33.024
This is different from position
where you need x and

00:15:33.024 --> 00:15:35.480
dx/dt are the initial
time.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.460
The equation will only tell you
what d^(2)x/dt^(2)^( )is.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.827
But in quantum mechanics,
dY /dt

00:15:41.827 --> 00:15:43.970
itself is determined,
so you don't get to choose

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:44.379
that.
 

00:15:44.379 --> 00:15:46.678
You just get to choose the
initial Y.

00:15:46.678 --> 00:15:50.913
That means an initial wave
function completely determines

00:15:50.913 --> 00:15:53.940
the future according to this
equation.

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.080
So don't worry about this
equation.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.054
I don't expect you all to see
it and immediately know what to

00:15:59.054 --> 00:16:02.700
do, but I want you to know that
there is an equation.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.750
That is known now.
 

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.575
That's the analog of F =
ma. If you solve this

00:16:06.575 --> 00:16:09.833
equation, you can predict the
future to the extent allowed by

00:16:09.833 --> 00:16:11.028
quantum mechanics.
 

00:16:11.028 --> 00:16:13.462
Given the present,
and the present means

00:16:13.462 --> 00:16:15.960
Y(x,0) is
given,

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.340
then you go to the math
department and say,

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.994
"This is my
Y(x,0).

00:16:18.994 --> 00:16:21.174
Please tell me by some trick
what is Y(x) and

00:16:21.174 --> 00:16:21.889
t."
 

00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:26.072
It turns out there is a trick
by which you can predict

00:16:26.072 --> 00:16:30.649
Y(x) and t.
Note also that this number

00:16:30.649 --> 00:16:35.070
i is present in the very
equations of motion.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:37.956
So this is not like the
i we used in electrical

00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:40.788
circuits where we really meant
sines and cosines,

00:16:40.788 --> 00:16:42.446
but we took
e^(t)^(q)or

00:16:42.446 --> 00:16:44.240
e^(i)^(w)
^(t),

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.272
always hoping in the end to
take the real part of the answer

00:16:47.272 --> 00:16:50.047
because the functions of
classical mechanics are always

00:16:50.047 --> 00:16:50.509
real.
 

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:53.143
But in quantum theory,
Y is intrinsically

00:16:53.143 --> 00:16:56.562
complex and it cannot get more
complex than that by putting an

00:16:56.562 --> 00:16:58.860
i in the equations of
motion,

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.250
but that's just the way it is.
 

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:05.519
You need the i to write
the equations.

00:17:05.519 --> 00:17:10.423
Therefore our goal then is to
learn different ways in which we

00:17:10.423 --> 00:17:11.788
can solve this.
 

00:17:11.788 --> 00:17:13.951
Now remember,
everybody noticed,

00:17:13.951 --> 00:17:17.650
this looks kind of familiar
here, this combination.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.009
It's up there somewhere.
 

00:17:19.009 --> 00:17:20.490
It looks a lot like this.
 

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.160
You see that?
 

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.269
But it's not quite that.
 

00:17:24.269 --> 00:17:26.990
That is working on a function
only of x;

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:31.028
this is working on a function
of x and t.

00:17:31.028 --> 00:17:33.334
And there are partial
derivatives here and there are

00:17:33.334 --> 00:17:34.509
total derivatives there.
 

00:17:34.509 --> 00:17:36.019
They are very privileged
functions.

00:17:36.019 --> 00:17:38.200
They describe states of
definite energy.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.567
This is an arbitrary function,
just evolving with time,

00:17:41.567 --> 00:17:43.750
so you should not mix the two
up.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:48.680
This Y is a generic
Y changing with time.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.000
So let's ask,
how can I calculate the future,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.509
given the present?
 

00:17:53.509 --> 00:17:55.980
How do I solve this equation?
 

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.140
So here is what you do.
 

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.328
I'm going to do it at two
levels.

00:18:00.328 --> 00:18:03.930
One is to tell you a little bit
about how you get there,

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.490
and for those of you who say,
"Look,

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.458
spare me the details,
I just want to know the

00:18:07.458 --> 00:18:09.292
answer,"
I will draw a box around the

00:18:09.292 --> 00:18:11.451
answer,
and you are free to start from

00:18:11.451 --> 00:18:11.828
there.
 

00:18:11.828 --> 00:18:15.772
But I want to give everyone a
chance to look under the hood

00:18:15.772 --> 00:18:17.608
and see what's happening.
 

00:18:17.608 --> 00:18:21.759
So given an equation like this,
which is pretty old stuff in

00:18:21.759 --> 00:18:24.923
mathematical physics from after
Newton's time,

00:18:24.923 --> 00:18:28.088
people always ask the following
question.

00:18:28.088 --> 00:18:30.874
They say, "Look,
I don't know if I can solve it

00:18:30.874 --> 00:18:33.440
for every imaginable initial
condition."

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.065
It's like saying,
even the case of the

00:18:35.065 --> 00:18:36.773
oscillator,
you may not be able to solve

00:18:36.773 --> 00:18:40.308
every initial condition,
you say, "Let me find a

00:18:40.308 --> 00:18:44.808
special case where
Y(x, t),

00:18:44.808 --> 00:18:47.529
which depends on x and
on t,

00:18:47.529 --> 00:18:54.642
has the following simple form -
it's a function of t alone times

00:18:54.642 --> 00:18:58.819
a function of x
alone."

00:18:58.819 --> 00:18:59.630
Okay?
 

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:04.030
I want you to know that no one
tells you that every solution to

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.088
the equation has this form.
 

00:19:06.088 --> 00:19:08.779
You guys have a question about
this?

00:19:08.779 --> 00:19:10.410
Over there.
 

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.019
Okay, good.
 

00:19:12.019 --> 00:19:15.259
All right, so this is an
assumption.

00:19:15.259 --> 00:19:19.105
You want to see if maybe there
are answers like this to the

00:19:19.105 --> 00:19:19.769
problem.
 

00:19:19.769 --> 00:19:22.953
The only way to do that is to
take their assumed form,

00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:26.438
put it into the equation and
see if you can find a solution

00:19:26.438 --> 00:19:27.460
of this form.
 

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.940
Not every solution looks like
this.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:33.575
For example,
you could write

00:19:33.575 --> 00:19:37.009
e^((x-t)2).
 

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:39.288
That's the function of x
and t.

00:19:39.288 --> 00:19:42.058
But it's not a function of
x times the function of

00:19:42.058 --> 00:19:42.950
t, you see that?
 

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.588
x and t are mixed
up together.

00:19:45.588 --> 00:19:48.454
You cannot rip it out at the
two parts, so it's not the most

00:19:48.454 --> 00:19:51.259
general thing that can happen;
it's a particular one.

00:19:51.259 --> 00:19:54.608
Right now, you are eager to get
any solution.

00:19:54.608 --> 00:19:56.259
You want to say,
"Can I do anything?

00:19:56.259 --> 00:19:59.299
Can I calculate even in the
simplest case what the future

00:19:59.299 --> 00:20:00.930
is, given the present?"
 

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:04.200
You're asking,
"Can this happen?"

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:09.819
So I'm going to show you now
that the equation does admit

00:20:09.819 --> 00:20:12.328
solutions of this type.
 

00:20:12.328 --> 00:20:16.650
So are you guys with me now on
what I'm trying to do?

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:22.390
I'm trying to see if this
equation admits solutions of

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:23.690
this form.
 

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:27.410
So let's take that and put it
here.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:31.769
Now here's where you've got to
do the math, okay?

00:20:31.769 --> 00:20:33.917
Take this Y and put it
here and start taking

00:20:33.917 --> 00:20:34.519
derivatives.
 

00:20:34.519 --> 00:20:37.088
Let's do the left hand side
first.

00:20:37.088 --> 00:20:40.440
Left hand side,
I have i‚Ñè.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.920
Then I bring the d by dt to act
on this product.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:50.099
d by dt partial means only time
has to be differentiated;

00:20:50.099 --> 00:20:51.980
x is to be held constant.
 

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.038
That's the partial derivative.
 

00:20:53.038 --> 00:20:54.680
That's the meaning of the
partial derivative.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.501
It's like an ordinary
derivative where the only

00:20:57.501 --> 00:21:00.568
variable you'd ever
differentiate is the one in the

00:21:00.568 --> 00:21:01.490
derivative.
 

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.278
So the entire
Y(x) doesn't do

00:21:04.278 --> 00:21:05.009
anything.
 

00:21:05.009 --> 00:21:06.348
It's like a constant.
 

00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:08.298
So you just put that
Y(x) there.

00:21:08.298 --> 00:21:10.640
Then the derivative,
d by dt,

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.720
comes here, and I claim it
becomes the ordinary derivative.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.730
That's the left hand side.
 

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:22.519
You understand that,
why that is true?

00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:24.816
Because on a function only of
time there's no difference

00:21:24.816 --> 00:21:27.029
between partial derivative and
ordinary derivative.

00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:28.848
It's got only one variable.
 

00:21:28.848 --> 00:21:31.609
The other potential variable
this d by dt,

00:21:31.609 --> 00:21:34.910
doesn't care about so it's just
standing there.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:36.990
That's the left hand side.
 

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:41.634
Now look at the right hand
side, all of this stuff,

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:47.022
and imagine putting for this
function Y this product

00:21:47.022 --> 00:21:47.858
form.
 

00:21:47.858 --> 00:21:50.491
Is it clear to you,
in the right hand side the

00:21:50.491 --> 00:21:52.538
situation's exactly the
opposite?

00:21:52.538 --> 00:21:54.762
You've got all these d by
dx's partials,

00:21:54.762 --> 00:21:57.470
they're only interested in this
function because it's got

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:58.630
x dependence.
 

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.990
F(t) doesn't do anything.
 

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:05.692
All the derivatives,
they go right through F,

00:22:05.692 --> 00:22:08.380
so you can write it as
F(t).

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.944
Now you have to take the
derivative with respect to

00:22:12.944 --> 00:22:13.950
Y.
 

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:17.933
That looks like
d^(2)Y

00:22:17.933 --> 00:22:24.490
/dx^(2)
V(x)Y(x).

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:27.273
If you follow this,
you're almost there,

00:22:27.273 --> 00:22:30.130
but take your time to
understand this.

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.778
The reason you write it as a
product of two functions is the

00:22:32.778 --> 00:22:35.067
left hand side is only
interested in differentiating

00:22:35.067 --> 00:22:37.593
the function F,
where it becomes the total

00:22:37.593 --> 00:22:38.200
derivative.
 

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.775
The right hand side is only
taking derivatives with respect

00:22:40.775 --> 00:22:43.039
to x so it acts on this
part of the function,

00:22:43.039 --> 00:22:44.240
it depends on x.
 

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.518
And all partial derivatives
become total derivatives because

00:22:48.518 --> 00:22:52.578
if you've got only one variable,
there's no need to write

00:22:52.578 --> 00:22:54.318
partial derivatives.
 

00:22:54.318 --> 00:22:59.507
This combination I'm going to
write to save some time as

00:22:59.507 --> 00:23:01.298
HY.
 

00:23:01.298 --> 00:23:05.118
Let's just say between you and
me it's a shorthand.

00:23:05.118 --> 00:23:11.088
HY is a shorthand
for this entire mess here.

00:23:11.088 --> 00:23:12.913
Don't ask me why it looks like
H times Y,

00:23:12.913 --> 00:23:13.859
where are the derivatives?
 

00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:16.640
It is a shorthand, okay.
 

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.895
I don't feel like writing the
combination over and over,

00:23:20.895 --> 00:23:23.450
I can call it HY.
 

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:26.088
So what equation do I have now?
 

00:23:26.088 --> 00:23:31.041
I have i‚Ñè
Y(x)dF/dt =

00:23:31.041 --> 00:23:36.317
F(t)HY,
where all I want you to notice,

00:23:36.317 --> 00:23:41.269
HY depends only
on x.

00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:42.619
It has no dependence on time.
 

00:23:42.619 --> 00:23:43.950
Do you see that?
 

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:52.970
There's nothing here that
depends on time.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.140
Okay, now this is a trick which
if you learned,

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.489
you'll be quite pleased,
because you'll find that as you

00:23:57.489 --> 00:23:59.970
do more and more stuff,
at least in physics or

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:04.160
economics or statistics,
the trick is a very old trick.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.885
The problem is quantum
mechanics, but the mathematics

00:24:06.885 --> 00:24:07.619
is very old.
 

00:24:07.619 --> 00:24:09.400
So what do you do next?
 

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.140
You divide both sides by
YF.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:25.009
So I say divide by
F(t)Y(x).

00:24:25.009 --> 00:24:26.900
What do you think will happen
if I divide by F(t),

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:27.608
Y(x)?
 

00:24:27.608 --> 00:24:29.924
On the left hand side,
I say divide by

00:24:29.924 --> 00:24:32.680
YF and the right
hand side,

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.141
I say divide by
YF,

00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:38.680
can you see that the Y
cancels here,

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.338
and you have a 1/F.
 

00:24:40.338 --> 00:24:43.670
F cancels here and you
have a 1/Y.

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:48.454
The equation then says
i‚Ñè(1/

00:24:48.454 --> 00:24:53.240
F(t))dF/dt =
1/Y(x)H

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:59.584
Y. I've
written this very slowly because

00:24:59.584 --> 00:25:02.846
I don't know,
you'll find this in many

00:25:02.846 --> 00:25:05.146
advanced books,
but you may not find it in our

00:25:05.146 --> 00:25:05.670
textbook.
 

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:08.308
So if you don't follow
something, you should tell me.

00:25:08.308 --> 00:25:12.650
There's plenty of time to do
this, so I'm in no rush at all.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:15.680
These are purely mathematical
manipulations.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:20.230
We have not done anything
involving physics.

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:23.859
You all follow this?
 

00:25:23.859 --> 00:25:25.079
Yes?
 

00:25:25.079 --> 00:25:26.250
Okay.
 

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:27.650
Now you have to ask yourself
the following.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:29.240
I love this argument.
 

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.896
Even if you don't follow this,
I'm just going to get it off my

00:25:31.896 --> 00:25:33.449
chest,
it is so clever,

00:25:33.449 --> 00:25:37.867
and here is the clever part -
this is supposedly a function of

00:25:37.867 --> 00:25:39.750
time,
you agree?

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:42.869
All for a function of time.
 

00:25:42.869 --> 00:25:45.700
This is a function of x.
 

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.868
This guy doesn't know what time
it is;

00:25:47.868 --> 00:25:49.430
this guy doesn't know what
x is.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:52.819
And yet they're supposed to be
equal.

00:25:52.819 --> 00:25:56.450
What can they be equal to?
 

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:59.171
They cannot be equal to a
function of time,

00:25:59.171 --> 00:26:01.893
because then,
as you vary time--suppose you

00:26:01.893 --> 00:26:04.680
think it's a function of time,
suppose.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.058
It's not so.
 

00:26:06.058 --> 00:26:08.680
Then as time varies,
this part is okay.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.936
It can vary with time to match
that, but this cannot vary with

00:26:11.936 --> 00:26:14.339
time at all, because there is no
time here.

00:26:14.339 --> 00:26:16.920
So this cannot depend on time.
 

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.202
And it cannot depend on
x, because if it was a

00:26:19.202 --> 00:26:21.180
function of x that it was
equal to,

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.056
as you vary x,
this can change with x

00:26:23.056 --> 00:26:23.920
to keep up with that.
 

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.859
This has no x dependence.
 

00:26:25.859 --> 00:26:27.509
It cannot vary with x.
 

00:26:27.509 --> 00:26:31.781
So this thing that they are
both equal to is not a function

00:26:31.781 --> 00:26:34.950
of time and it's not a function
of space.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.650
It's a constant.
 

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:38.220
That's all it can be.
 

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:43.497
So the constant is going to
very cleverly be given the

00:26:43.497 --> 00:26:45.288
symbol E.
 

00:26:45.288 --> 00:26:47.578
We're going to call the
constant E.

00:26:47.578 --> 00:26:50.583
It turns out E is
connected to the energy of the

00:26:50.583 --> 00:26:51.140
problem.
 

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:55.066
So now I have two equations,
this = E and that =

00:26:55.066 --> 00:26:58.118
E and I'm going to write
it down.

00:26:58.118 --> 00:27:06.134
So one of them says i
‚Ñè (1/F) dF/dt =

00:27:06.134 --> 00:27:07.470
E.
 

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:09.769
So let me bring the F
here.

00:27:09.769 --> 00:27:14.079
Other one says H
Y = E

00:27:14.079 --> 00:27:20.773
Y. These two
equations, if you solve them,

00:27:20.773 --> 00:27:26.558
will give you the solution you
are looking for.

00:27:26.558 --> 00:27:28.810
In other words,
going back here,

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:31.253
yes,
this equation does admit

00:27:31.253 --> 00:27:34.423
solutions of this form,
of the product form,

00:27:34.423 --> 00:27:37.711
provided the function F
you put in the product that

00:27:37.711 --> 00:27:40.019
depends on time obeys this
equation,

00:27:40.019 --> 00:27:43.343
and the function Y that
depends only on x obeys

00:27:43.343 --> 00:27:44.230
this equation.
 

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:46.646
Remember, HY is
the shorthand for this long

00:27:46.646 --> 00:27:47.640
bunch of derivatives.
 

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.681
We'll come to that in a moment,
but let's solve this equation

00:27:51.681 --> 00:27:52.220
first.
 

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:54.099
Now can you guys do this in
your head?

00:27:54.099 --> 00:28:03.308
i‚ÑèdF/dt = EF.
 

00:28:03.308 --> 00:28:06.537
So it's saying F is a
function of time whose time

00:28:06.537 --> 00:28:08.650
derivative is the function
itself.

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:12.059
Everybody knows what such a
function is.

00:28:12.059 --> 00:28:14.509
It's an exponential.
 

00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:16.784
And the answer is,
I'm going to write it down and

00:28:16.784 --> 00:28:20.428
you can check,
F(t) is F(0)

00:28:20.428 --> 00:28:26.750
e^(‚àíiEt/√¢¬Ñ¬è).
If you want now,

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.240
take the derivative and check.
 

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.650
F(0) is some constant.
 

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:34.844
I call it F(0) because
if t = 0,

00:28:34.844 --> 00:28:38.180
this goes away and F(t)
= F(0).

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:39.920
But take the time derivative
and see.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.650
When you take a time derivative
of this,

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:45.108
you get the same thing times
‚àíiE/√¢¬Ñ¬è,

00:28:45.108 --> 00:28:47.529
and when you multiply by 
i‚Ñè,

00:28:47.529 --> 00:28:50.359
everything cancels except
EF.

00:28:50.359 --> 00:28:52.700
So this is a very easy solution.
 

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.950
So let's stop and understand.
 

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:58.505
It says that if you are looking
for solutions that are products

00:28:58.505 --> 00:29:00.568
of F(t) times
f(x),

00:29:00.568 --> 00:29:05.400
F(t) necessarily is this
exponential function,

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.700
which is the only function you
can have.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.170
But now once you pick that
E, you can pick E

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:13.423
to be whatever you like,
but then you must also solve

00:29:13.423 --> 00:29:14.940
this equation at the same time.
 

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.808
But what is this equation.
 

00:29:16.808 --> 00:29:21.006
This says
-‚Ñè^(2)/2md^(2)

00:29:21.006 --> 00:29:25.801
Y/dx^(2)
VY =

00:29:25.801 --> 00:29:30.462
EY,
and you guys know who that is,

00:29:30.462 --> 00:29:31.019
right?
 

00:29:31.019 --> 00:29:32.890
What is it?
 

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:39.295
What can you say about the
function that satisfies that

00:29:39.295 --> 00:29:40.599
equation?
 

00:29:40.599 --> 00:29:43.029
Have you seen it before?
 

00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:44.150
Yes?
 

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:45.118
What is it?
 

00:29:45.118 --> 00:29:46.690
Student: 
Schrˆdinger equation.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.538
Prof: It's the state of
definite energy.

00:29:48.538 --> 00:29:51.948
Remember, we said functions of
definite energy obey that

00:29:51.948 --> 00:29:52.630
equation.
 

00:29:52.630 --> 00:30:02.420
So that Y is really just
Y_E.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.460
So now I'll put these two
pieces together,

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:09.088
and this is where those of you
who drifted off can come back,

00:30:09.088 --> 00:30:12.557
because what I'm telling you is
that the Schrˆdinger

00:30:12.557 --> 00:30:15.778
equation in fact admits a
certain solution which is a

00:30:15.778 --> 00:30:19.368
product of a function of time
and a function of space.

00:30:19.368 --> 00:30:22.430
And what we found by fiddling
around with it is that F(t)

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:24.348
and Y are very
special,

00:30:24.348 --> 00:30:28.380
and F(t) must look like
e^(‚àíiEt/

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:32.450
‚Ñè),
and Y is just our

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:37.025
friend, Y
_E(x), which

00:30:37.025 --> 00:30:42.210
are functions associated with a
definite energy.

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:43.108
Yes?
 

00:30:43.108 --> 00:30:46.077
Student:  Is it possible
that there are other solutions,

00:30:46.077 --> 00:30:48.901
x/Y(x,
t) that don't satisfy the

00:30:48.901 --> 00:30:49.618
conditions?
 

00:30:49.618 --> 00:30:51.953
Prof: Okay,
the question is,

00:30:51.953 --> 00:30:55.936
are there other solutions for
which this factorized form is

00:30:55.936 --> 00:30:56.828
not true?
 

00:30:56.828 --> 00:31:00.705
Yes, and I will put you out of
your suspense very soon by

00:31:00.705 --> 00:31:02.160
talking about that.
 

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:06.230
But I want everyone to
understand that you can at least

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:09.849
solve one case of
Schrˆdinger's equation.

00:31:09.849 --> 00:31:10.710
So what does this mean?
 

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:13.210
I want you guys to think about
it.

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:18.140
This says if you start Y
in some arbitrary configuration,

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:21.009
that's my initial state,
let it evolve with time,

00:31:21.009 --> 00:31:25.567
it obeys this rather crazy,
complicated Schrˆdinger

00:31:25.567 --> 00:31:26.480
equation.
 

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:31.282
But if I start it at t =
0, in a state which is a state

00:31:31.282 --> 00:31:34.905
of definite energy,
namely a state obeying that

00:31:34.905 --> 00:31:35.930
equation.
 

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.548
Then its future is very simple.
 

00:31:38.548 --> 00:31:43.362
All you do is attach this phase
factor, e^(‚àíiEt/

00:31:43.362 --> 00:31:44.910
‚Ñè).
 

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:47.622
Therefore it's not a generic
solution, because you may not in

00:31:47.622 --> 00:31:50.558
general start with a state which
is a state of definite energy.

00:31:50.558 --> 00:31:53.130
You'll start with some random
Y(x) and it's made

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:55.114
up of many,
many Y_E's

00:31:55.114 --> 00:31:57.490
that come in the expansion of
that Y,

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:59.160
so it's not going to always
work.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.510
But if you picked it so that
there's only one such term in

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:05.273
the sum over E,
namely one such function,

00:32:05.273 --> 00:32:07.450
then the future is given by
this.

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:10.119
For example,
if you have a particle in a

00:32:10.119 --> 00:32:12.861
box,
you remember the wave function

00:32:12.861 --> 00:32:17.535
Y_n looks like
square root of 2/Lsine(n

00:32:17.535 --> 00:32:21.605
px/L). An
arbitrary Y doesn't look

00:32:21.605 --> 00:32:23.338
like any of these.
 

00:32:23.338 --> 00:32:27.281
These guys, remember,
are nice functions that do many

00:32:27.281 --> 00:32:28.420
oscillations.
 

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:32.858
But if you chose it initially
to be exactly the sine function,

00:32:32.858 --> 00:32:35.077
for example,
Y_1,

00:32:35.077 --> 00:32:39.810
then I claim as time evolves,
the future state is just this

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:44.529
initial sine function times this
simple exponential.

00:32:44.529 --> 00:32:52.930
This behavior is very special
and it called normal modes.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:56.058
It's a very common idea in
mathematical physics.

00:32:56.058 --> 00:32:59.434
It's the following - it's very
familiar even before you did

00:32:59.434 --> 00:33:00.598
quantum mechanics.
 

00:33:00.598 --> 00:33:06.202
Take a string tied at both ends
and you pluck the string and you

00:33:06.202 --> 00:33:07.358
release it.
 

00:33:07.358 --> 00:33:10.329
Most probably if you pluck it
at one point,

00:33:10.329 --> 00:33:14.150
you'll probably pull it in the
middle and let it go.

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:17.348
That's the initial
Y(x,t),

00:33:17.348 --> 00:33:19.400
this time for a string.
 

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.240
Pull it in the middle,
let it go.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.556
There's an equation that
determines the evolutions of

00:33:24.556 --> 00:33:25.450
that string.
 

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:27.368
I remind you what that equation
is.

00:33:27.368 --> 00:33:31.901
It's d^(2)Y
/dx^(2)=(1/veloc

00:33:31.901 --> 00:33:36.328
ity^(2))d^(2)Y
/dt^(2).

00:33:36.328 --> 00:33:38.710
That's the wave equation for a
string.

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:41.276
It's somewhat different from
this problem,

00:33:41.276 --> 00:33:44.155
because it's a second
derivative in time that's

00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:44.970
involved.
 

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:48.163
Nonetheless,
here is an amazing property of

00:33:48.163 --> 00:33:51.509
this equation,
derived by similar methods.

00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:53.846
If you pull a string like this
and let it go,

00:33:53.846 --> 00:33:55.920
it will go crazy when you
release it.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.068
I don't even know what it will
do.

00:33:57.068 --> 00:34:00.435
It will do all kinds of things,
stuff will go back and forth,

00:34:00.435 --> 00:34:01.390
back and forth.
 

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:06.412
But if you can deform the
string at t = 0 to look

00:34:06.412 --> 00:34:10.875
exactly like this,
sine(px/L)

00:34:10.875 --> 00:34:14.469
times a number A,
that's not easy to do.

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:17.282
Do you understand that to
produce the initial profile,

00:34:17.282 --> 00:34:19.989
one hand is not enough,
two hands are not enough?

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:22.893
You've got to get infinite
number of your friends,

00:34:22.893 --> 00:34:24.789
who are infinitesimally small.
 

00:34:24.789 --> 00:34:28.360
You line them up along the
string until each one--tell the

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.179
person here to pull it exactly
this height.

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:33.199
Person here has to pull it
exactly that height.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:35.530
You all lift your hands up,
then I follow you.

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:37.239
You follow this perfect sine.
 

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:40.639
Then you let go.
 

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:46.590
What do you think will happen
then?

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:50.759
What do you think will be the
subsequent evolution of the

00:34:50.759 --> 00:34:51.429
string?
 

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:52.030
Do you have any guess?
 

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:52.510
Yes?
 

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:54.559
Student: 
&gt;

00:34:54.559 --> 00:35:01.222
Prof: It will go up and
down, and the future of that

00:35:01.222 --> 00:35:07.309
string will look like
cosine(pxvt/L).

00:35:07.309 --> 00:35:08.150
Look at it.
 

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:10.355
This is a time dependence,
that t = 0,

00:35:10.355 --> 00:35:12.210
this goes away,
this initial state.

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:14.789
But look what happens at a
later time.

00:35:14.789 --> 00:35:20.050
Every point x rises and
falls with the same period.

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:22.579
It goes up and down all
together.

00:35:22.579 --> 00:35:25.139
That means a little later it
will look like that,

00:35:25.139 --> 00:35:26.360
a little later it will look
like that,

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.300
then it will look like this,
then it will look like this,

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.309
then it will look like that,
then it will go back and forth.

00:35:30.309 --> 00:35:32.900
But at every instant,
this guy, this guy,

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:36.268
this guy are all rescaled by
the same amount from the

00:35:36.268 --> 00:35:37.500
starting value.
 

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.929
That's called a normal mode.
 

00:35:39.929 --> 00:35:42.262
Now your question was,
are there other solutions to

00:35:42.262 --> 00:35:42.869
the string?
 

00:35:42.869 --> 00:35:43.969
Of course.
 

00:35:43.969 --> 00:35:46.280
Typically, if you don't think
about it and pluck the string,

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.570
your initial state will be a
sum of these normal modes,

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:51.989
and that will evolve in a
complicated way.

00:35:51.989 --> 00:35:54.650
But if you engineered it to
begin exactly this way,

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:58.583
or in any one of those other
functions where you put an extra

00:35:58.583 --> 00:36:01.043
n here,
they all have the remarkable

00:36:01.043 --> 00:36:03.750
property that they rise and fall
in step.

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:07.650
What we have found here is in
the quantum problem,

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:11.289
if you start the system in that
particular configuration,

00:36:11.289 --> 00:36:15.315
then its future has got a
single time dependence common to

00:36:15.315 --> 00:36:15.670
it.
 

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:20.760
That's the meaning of the
factorized solution.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.860
So we know one simple example.
 

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.889
Take a particle in a box.
 

00:36:24.889 --> 00:36:28.525
If it's in the lowest energy
state or ground state the wave

00:36:28.525 --> 00:36:30.219
function looks like that.
 

00:36:30.219 --> 00:36:35.052
Then the future of that will be
Y_1/x

00:36:35.052 --> 00:36:38.677
and t will be the
Y_1x

00:36:38.677 --> 00:36:41.820
times
e^(-iE1t/‚Ñè),

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:45.460
where E_1 =
‚Ñè^(2)

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:48.940
p^(2)
1^(2)/2mL^(2).

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:53.159
 That's the energy
associated with that function.

00:36:53.159 --> 00:36:57.739
That's how it will oscillate.
 

00:36:57.739 --> 00:37:01.481
Now you guys follow what I said
now, with an analogy with the

00:37:01.481 --> 00:37:03.539
string and the quantum problem?
 

00:37:03.539 --> 00:37:05.190
They're slightly different
equations.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:06.860
One is second order,
one is first order.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.940
One has cosines in it,
one has exponentials in it.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:13.722
But the common property is,
this is also a function of time

00:37:13.722 --> 00:37:15.679
times the function of space.
 

00:37:15.679 --> 00:37:26.260
Here, this is a function of
time and a function of space.

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:30.612
Okay, so I'm going to spend
some time analyzing this

00:37:30.612 --> 00:37:32.489
particular function.
 

00:37:32.489 --> 00:37:37.945
Y(x) and t =
e^(‚àíiEt/√¢¬Ñ¬è)^(

00:37:37.945 --> 00:37:41.130
)Y
_E(x).

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:45.525
And I'm going to do an abuse in
rotation and give the subscript

00:37:45.525 --> 00:37:47.510
E to this guy also.
 

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:50.094
What I mean to tell you by that
is, this Y,

00:37:50.094 --> 00:37:52.731
which solves Schrˆdinger
equation--by the way,

00:37:52.731 --> 00:37:54.420
I invite you to go check it.
 

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.583
Take the Y,
put it into Schrˆdinger

00:37:56.583 --> 00:37:58.369
equation and you will find it
works.

00:37:58.369 --> 00:38:01.599
In the notes I've given you,
I merely tell you that this is

00:38:01.599 --> 00:38:04.050
a solution to Schrˆdinger's
equation.

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:06.329
I don't go through this
argument of assuming it's a

00:38:06.329 --> 00:38:07.469
product form and so on.
 

00:38:07.469 --> 00:38:08.268
That's optional.
 

00:38:08.268 --> 00:38:10.280
I don't care if you remember
that or not,

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.030
but this solves
Schrˆdinger equation,

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:16.458
and I call it
Y_E because the

00:38:16.458 --> 00:38:22.362
function of the right hand side
are identified with states of

00:38:22.362 --> 00:38:24.329
definite energy.
 

00:38:24.329 --> 00:38:31.313
Okay, what will happen if you
measure various quantities in

00:38:31.313 --> 00:38:32.880
this state?
 

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.684
For example,
what's the position going to

00:38:34.684 --> 00:38:34.909
be?
 

00:38:34.909 --> 00:38:37.400
What's the probability for
definite position?

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.510
What's the probability for
definite momentum?

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:41.849
What's the probability for
definite anything?

00:38:41.849 --> 00:38:43.320
How will they vary with time?
 

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:47.030
I will show you,
nothing depends on time.

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:49.704
You can say,
"How can nothing depend on

00:38:49.704 --> 00:38:50.139
time?
 

00:38:50.139 --> 00:38:52.900
I see time in the function
here."

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.099
But it will go away.
 

00:38:55.099 --> 00:38:59.780
Let us ask, what is the
probability that the particle is

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:03.949
at x at time t for a
solution like this?

00:39:03.949 --> 00:39:08.030
You know, the answer is
Y *(x,t)

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:13.603
Y(x,t), and
what do you get when you do

00:39:13.603 --> 00:39:14.500
that?
 

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:18.048
You will get Y_E
*(x

00:39:18.048 --> 00:39:21.519
)Y
_E(x). Then you

00:39:21.519 --> 00:39:25.610
will get the absolute value of
this guy squared,

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:27.849
e^(iEt)^( )times
e^(-iEt),

00:39:27.849 --> 00:39:34.710
and that's just 1.
 

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:38.541
I hope all of you know that
this e^(i)^( )absolute

00:39:38.541 --> 00:39:39.980
value squared is 1.
 

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.349
So it does not depend on time.
 

00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:45.867
Even though Y depends on
time, Y *Y has no

00:39:45.867 --> 00:39:46.889
time dependence.
 

00:39:46.889 --> 00:39:50.512
That means the probability for
finding that particle will not

00:39:50.512 --> 00:39:51.659
change with time.
 

00:39:51.659 --> 00:39:57.050
That means if you start the
particle in the ground state,

00:39:57.050 --> 00:40:00.641
Y, and let's say
Y^(2) in fact looks

00:40:00.641 --> 00:40:04.925
pretty much the same,
it's a real function,

00:40:04.925 --> 00:40:10.219
this probability does not
change with time.

00:40:10.219 --> 00:40:13.545
That means you can make a
measurement any time you want

00:40:13.545 --> 00:40:16.195
for position,
and the odds don't change with

00:40:16.195 --> 00:40:16.750
time.
 

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:17.949
It's very interesting.
 

00:40:17.949 --> 00:40:20.289
It depends on time and it
doesn't depend on time.

00:40:20.289 --> 00:40:22.980
It's a lot like
e^(ipx/‚Ñè).

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:26.130
It seems to depend on x
but the density does not depend

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:28.610
on x because the
exponential goes away.

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:30.469
Similarly, it does depend on
time.

00:40:30.469 --> 00:40:32.985
Without the time dependence,
it won't satisfy

00:40:32.985 --> 00:40:36.018
Schrˆdinger equation,
but the minute you take the

00:40:36.018 --> 00:40:38.018
absolute value,
this goes away.

00:40:38.018 --> 00:40:41.443
That means for this particle,
I can draw a little graph that

00:40:41.443 --> 00:40:43.938
looks like this,
and that is the probability

00:40:43.938 --> 00:40:46.260
cloud you find in all the
textbooks.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:47.510
Have you seen the probability
cloud?

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:51.150
They've got a little atom
that's a little fuzzy stuff all

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:51.929
around it.
 

00:40:51.929 --> 00:40:54.588
They are the states of the
hydrogen atom or some other

00:40:54.588 --> 00:40:54.940
atom.
 

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.909
How do you think you get that?
 

00:40:56.909 --> 00:40:59.887
You solve a similar equation,
except it will be in 3

00:40:59.887 --> 00:41:02.050
dimensions instead of 1
dimension,

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:08.532
and for V(x), you write
-Ze^(2)/r, if you want

00:41:08.532 --> 00:41:12.380
r as x^(2) y^(2)
z^(2).

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:15.599
Ze is the nuclear charge,
and -e is the electron

00:41:15.599 --> 00:41:16.099
charge.
 

00:41:16.099 --> 00:41:20.918
You put that in and you solve
the equation and you will find a

00:41:20.918 --> 00:41:24.789
whole bunch of solutions that
behave like this.

00:41:24.789 --> 00:41:27.061
They are called stationary
states, because in that

00:41:27.061 --> 00:41:29.710
stationary state--
see, if a hydrogen atom starts

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:32.275
out in this state,
which is a state of definite

00:41:32.275 --> 00:41:33.704
energy,
as time goes by,

00:41:33.704 --> 00:41:35.840
nothing happens to it
essentially.

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.538
Something trivial happens;
it picks up the phase factor,

00:41:38.538 --> 00:41:41.976
but the probability for finding
the electron never changes with

00:41:41.976 --> 00:41:42.420
time.
 

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:45.161
So if you like,
you can draw a little cloud

00:41:45.161 --> 00:41:46.987
whose thickness,
if you like,

00:41:46.987 --> 00:41:50.969
measures the probability for
finding it at that location.

00:41:50.969 --> 00:41:52.070
So that will have all kinds of
shape.

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:54.654
It looks like dumbbells,
pointing to the north pole,

00:41:54.654 --> 00:41:57.340
south pole, maybe uniformly
spherical distribution.

00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:01.932
They're all the probability of
finding the electron in that

00:42:01.932 --> 00:42:05.179
state, and it doesn't change
with time.

00:42:05.179 --> 00:42:08.056
So a hydrogen atom,
when you leave it alone,

00:42:08.056 --> 00:42:10.800
will be in one of these allowed
states.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.039
You don't need the hydrogen
atom;

00:42:12.039 --> 00:42:14.889
this particle in a box is a
good enough quantum system.

00:42:14.889 --> 00:42:16.659
If you start it like that,
it will stay like that;

00:42:16.659 --> 00:42:19.474
if you start it like that,
it will stay like that,

00:42:19.474 --> 00:42:20.969
times that phase factor.
 

00:42:20.969 --> 00:42:25.356
So stationary states are
important, because that's where

00:42:25.356 --> 00:42:27.510
things have settled down.
 

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:31.231
Okay, now you should also
realize that that's not a

00:42:31.231 --> 00:42:32.719
typical situation.
 

00:42:32.719 --> 00:42:37.025
Suppose you have in 1
dimension, there's a particle on

00:42:37.025 --> 00:42:41.168
a hill, and at t = 0,
it's given by some wave

00:42:41.168 --> 00:42:43.929
function that looks like this.
 

00:42:43.929 --> 00:42:47.032
So it's got some average
position, and if you expand it

00:42:47.032 --> 00:42:50.425
in terms of exponentials of
p, it's got some range of

00:42:50.425 --> 00:42:51.460
momenta in it.
 

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:54.559
What will happen to this as a
function of time?

00:42:54.559 --> 00:42:56.940
Can you make a guess?
 

00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:01.070
Let's say it's right now got an
average momentum to the left.

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:04.730
What do you think will happen
to it?

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:05.369
Pardon me?
 

00:43:05.369 --> 00:43:06.280
Student:  It will move
to the left.

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.139
Prof: It will move to
the left.

00:43:07.139 --> 00:43:10.588
Except for the fuzziness,
you can apply your classical

00:43:10.588 --> 00:43:11.369
intuition.
 

00:43:11.369 --> 00:43:13.369
It's got some position,
maybe not precise.

00:43:13.369 --> 00:43:15.369
It's got some momentum,
maybe not precise,

00:43:15.369 --> 00:43:17.565
but when you leave something on
top of a hill,

00:43:17.565 --> 00:43:19.420
it's going to slide down the
hill.

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:21.898
The average x is going
to go this way,

00:43:21.898 --> 00:43:24.210
and the average momentum will
increase.

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:27.282
So that's a situation where the
average of the physical

00:43:27.282 --> 00:43:28.989
quantities change with time.
 

00:43:28.989 --> 00:43:31.862
That's because this state is
not a function

00:43:31.862 --> 00:43:34.119
Y_E(x).
 

00:43:34.119 --> 00:43:35.380
It's some random function you
picked.

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:38.713
Random functions you picked in
some potential will in fact

00:43:38.713 --> 00:43:42.280
evolve with time in such a way
that measurable quantities will

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.510
change with time.
 

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:45.836
The odds for x or the
odds for p,

00:43:45.836 --> 00:43:48.213
odds for everything else,
will change with time,

00:43:48.213 --> 00:43:48.670
okay?
 

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:50.880
So stationary states are very
privileged,

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.860
because if you start them that
way,

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.021
they stay that way,
and that's why when you look at

00:43:55.021 --> 00:43:58.050
atoms,
they typically stay that way.

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:00.998
But once in a while,
an atom will jump from one

00:44:00.998 --> 00:44:05.036
stationary state to another one,
and you can say that looks like

00:44:05.036 --> 00:44:06.320
a contradiction.
 

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.244
If it's stationary,
what's it doing jumping from

00:44:08.244 --> 00:44:08.900
here to there?
 

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:14.340
You know the answer to that?
 

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.760
Why does an atom ever change
then?

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.929
If it's in a state of definite
E, it should be that way

00:44:18.929 --> 00:44:19.449
forever.
 

00:44:19.449 --> 00:44:22.369
Why do they go up and down?
 

00:44:22.369 --> 00:44:23.340
Want to guess?
 

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:26.670
Student: 
&gt;

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:27.179
Prof: That's correct.
 

00:44:27.179 --> 00:44:28.860
So she said by absorbing
photons.

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:33.023
And what I really mean by that
is, this problem V(x)

00:44:33.023 --> 00:44:37.260
involves only the coulomb force
between the electron and the

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:38.050
proton.
 

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:40.654
If that's all you have,
an electron in the field of a

00:44:40.654 --> 00:44:42.657
proton, it will pick one of
these levels,

00:44:42.657 --> 00:44:44.159
it can stay there forever.
 

00:44:44.159 --> 00:44:46.487
When you shine light,
you're applying an

00:44:46.487 --> 00:44:47.920
electromagnetic field.
 

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:51.358
The electric field and magnetic
field apply extra forces in the

00:44:51.358 --> 00:44:54.518
charge and V(x) should
change to something else.

00:44:54.518 --> 00:44:57.106
So that this function is no
longer a state of definite

00:44:57.106 --> 00:44:59.695
energy for the new problem,
because you've changed the

00:44:59.695 --> 00:45:00.769
rules of the game.
 

00:45:00.769 --> 00:45:03.710
You modified the potential.
 

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:06.916
Then of course it will move
around and it will change from

00:45:06.916 --> 00:45:08.210
one state to another.
 

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:11.780
But an isolated atom will
remain that way forever.

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:15.329
But it turns out even that's
not exactly correct.

00:45:15.329 --> 00:45:19.492
You can take an isolated atom,
in the first excited state of

00:45:19.492 --> 00:45:23.585
hydrogen, you come back a short
time later, you'll find the

00:45:23.585 --> 00:45:25.349
fellow has come down.
 

00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:27.112
And you say,
"Look, I didn't turn on

00:45:27.112 --> 00:45:28.039
any electric field.
 

00:45:28.039 --> 00:45:30.210
E = 0, B = 0.
 

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:32.809
What made the atom come
down?"

00:45:32.809 --> 00:45:37.090
Do you know what the answer to
that is?

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:37.800
Any rumors?
 

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.510
Yes?
 

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:40.280
Student:  Photon
emission?

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.289
Prof: Its photon is
emitted,

00:45:42.289 --> 00:45:45.318
but you need an extra thing,
extra electrical magnetic field

00:45:45.318 --> 00:45:47.679
to act on it before it will emit
the photon.

00:45:47.679 --> 00:45:48.489
But where is the field?
 

00:45:48.489 --> 00:45:49.969
I've turned everything off.
 

00:45:49.969 --> 00:45:53.800
E and B are both
0.

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:59.237
So it turns out that the state
E = B = 0 is like

00:45:59.237 --> 00:46:03.871
a state say in a harmonic
oscillator potential x =

00:46:03.871 --> 00:46:06.304
p = 0,
sitting at the bottom of the

00:46:06.304 --> 00:46:06.539
well.
 

00:46:06.539 --> 00:46:08.768
We know that's not allowed in
quantum mechanics.

00:46:08.768 --> 00:46:11.960
You cannot have definite
x and definite p.

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:16.681
It turns out in quantum theory,
E and B are like

00:46:16.681 --> 00:46:18.539
x and p.
 

00:46:18.539 --> 00:46:21.036
That means the state of
definite E is not a state

00:46:21.036 --> 00:46:22.079
of definite B.
 

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:24.222
A state of definite B is
not a state of definite

00:46:24.222 --> 00:46:24.659
E.
 

00:46:24.659 --> 00:46:26.882
It looks that way in the
macroscopic world,

00:46:26.882 --> 00:46:29.900
because the fluctuations in
E and B are very

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:30.429
small.
 

00:46:30.429 --> 00:46:33.469
Therefore, just like in the
lowest energy state,

00:46:33.469 --> 00:46:36.873
an oscillator has got some
probability to be jiggling back

00:46:36.873 --> 00:46:39.559
and forth in x and also
in p.

00:46:39.559 --> 00:46:42.500
The vacuum, which we think has
no E and no B,

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:45.135
has small fluctuations,
because E and B

00:46:45.135 --> 00:46:48.280
both vanishing is like x
and p both vanishing.

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:49.199
Not allowed.
 

00:46:49.199 --> 00:46:51.780
So you've got to have a little
spread in both E and both

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:52.239
B.
 

00:46:52.239 --> 00:46:54.860
They're called quantum
fluctuations of the vacuum.

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:57.480
So that's a theory of nothing.
 

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.161
The vacuum you think is the
most uninteresting thing,

00:47:00.161 --> 00:47:02.327
and yet it is not completely
uninteresting,

00:47:02.327 --> 00:47:04.389
because it's got these
fluctuations.

00:47:04.389 --> 00:47:08.047
It's those fluctuations that
tickle the atom and make it come

00:47:08.047 --> 00:47:10.610
from an excited state to a
ground state.

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:14.742
Okay, so unless you tamper with
the atom in some fashion,

00:47:14.742 --> 00:47:17.619
it will remain in a stationary
state.

00:47:17.619 --> 00:47:19.730
Those states are states of
definite energy.

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:22.385
They are found by solving the
Schrˆdinger equation

00:47:22.385 --> 00:47:23.420
without time in it.
 

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:25.527
H Y = E
Y is called the time

00:47:25.527 --> 00:47:27.099
independent Schrˆdinger
equation,

00:47:27.099 --> 00:47:30.530
and that's what most of us do
most of the time.

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:32.829
The problem can be more
complicated.

00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:35.090
It can involve two particles,
can involve ten particles.

00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:38.190
It may not involve this force,
may involve another force,

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:41.630
but everybody is spending most
of his time or her time solving

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:45.409
the Schrˆdinger equation to
find states of definite energy,

00:47:45.409 --> 00:47:47.780
because that's where things
will end up.

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:52.407
All right, I've only shown you
that the probability to find

00:47:52.407 --> 00:47:56.159
different positions doesn't
change with time.

00:47:56.159 --> 00:47:58.947
I will show you the probability
to find different anything

00:47:58.947 --> 00:48:00.268
doesn't change with time.
 

00:48:00.268 --> 00:48:03.163
Nothing will change with time,
not just x probability,

00:48:03.163 --> 00:48:04.610
so I'll do one more example.
 

00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:09.224
Let's ask, what's the
probability to find a momentum

00:48:09.224 --> 00:48:10.219
p?
 

00:48:10.219 --> 00:48:12.190
What are we supposed to do?
 

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:16.480
We're supposed to take
e^(ipx)^(/

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:22.860
‚Ñè )times the
function at some time t

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:25.610
and do that integral.
 

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:28.603
I'm sorry, you should take that
and do that integral,

00:48:28.603 --> 00:48:31.309
and then you take the absolute
value of that.

00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:33.409
And that's done at every time.
 

00:48:33.409 --> 00:48:37.664
You take the absolute value and
that's the probability to get

00:48:37.664 --> 00:48:39.579
momentum p,
right?

00:48:39.579 --> 00:48:41.510
The recipe was,
if you want the probability,

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:43.755
take the given function,
multiply to the conjugate of

00:48:43.755 --> 00:48:45.960
Y_p and
do the integral,

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:51.590
dL and dx.
 

00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:54.382
Y(x,t) in general
has got complicated time

00:48:54.382 --> 00:48:56.159
dependence, but not our
Y.

00:48:56.159 --> 00:48:57.480
Remember our Y?
 

00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:03.992
Our Y looks like
Y(x) times e^(

00:49:03.992 --> 00:49:07.489
‚àíiEt/√¢¬Ñ¬è).
 

00:49:07.489 --> 00:49:10.918
But when you take the absolute
value, this has nothing to do

00:49:10.918 --> 00:49:11.849
with x.
 

00:49:11.849 --> 00:49:14.626
You can pull it outside the
integral--or let me put it

00:49:14.626 --> 00:49:15.360
another way.
 

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.739
Let's do the integral and see
what you get.

00:49:17.739 --> 00:49:21.172
You will find
A_p looks like

00:49:21.172 --> 00:49:23.748
A_p
(0)e^(‚àíiEt/

00:49:23.748 --> 00:49:25.309
‚Ñè).
 

00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:26.768
Do you see that?
 

00:49:26.768 --> 00:49:30.045
If the only thing that happens
to Y is that you get an

00:49:30.045 --> 00:49:33.208
extra factor at later times,
only thing that happens to the

00:49:33.208 --> 00:49:36.389
A_p is it gets
the extra factor at later times.

00:49:36.389 --> 00:49:42.101
But the probability to find
momentum p is the

00:49:42.101 --> 00:49:48.260
absolute value square of that,
and in the absolute value

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:51.619
process, this guy is gone.
 

00:49:51.619 --> 00:49:54.159
You follow that?
 

00:49:54.159 --> 00:49:57.570
Since the wave function changes
by a simple phase factor,

00:49:57.570 --> 00:50:01.342
the coefficient to have a
definite momentum also changes

00:50:01.342 --> 00:50:05.320
by the same phase factor.This is
called a phase factor,

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:08.103
exponential of modulus 1,
but when you take the absolute

00:50:08.103 --> 00:50:12.429
value,
the guy doesn't do anything.

00:50:12.429 --> 00:50:14.500
Now you can replace p by
some other variable.

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:15.190
It doesn't matter.
 

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:17.518
The story is always the same.
 

00:50:17.518 --> 00:50:22.460
So a state of definite energy
seems to evolve in time,

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:24.429
because e^(ipx)^(/
‚Ñè),

00:50:24.429 --> 00:50:26.920
but none of the probabilities
change with time.

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.389
It's absolutely stationary.
 

00:50:28.389 --> 00:50:30.539
Just put anything you measure.
 

00:50:30.539 --> 00:50:33.440
That's why those states are
very important.

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:40.922
Okay, now I want to caution you
that not every solution looks

00:50:40.922 --> 00:50:42.420
like this.
 

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:43.280
That's the question you raised.
 

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.489
I'm going to answer that
question now.

00:50:45.489 --> 00:50:48.561
Let's imagine that I find two
solutions to the

00:50:48.561 --> 00:50:51.360
Schrˆdinger equation of
this form.

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:54.335
Solution Y_1
looks like

00:50:54.335 --> 00:50:59.773
Y_1(x,t),
looks like e^(ipx)^(/

00:50:59.773 --> 00:51:04.264
‚Ñè
)Y_1,

00:51:04.264 --> 00:51:07.489
Y_E1(x).
 

00:51:07.489 --> 00:51:10.630
That's one solution for energy
E_1.

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:16.172
Then there's another solution,
Y_2 (x)

00:51:16.172 --> 00:51:21.170
looks like e^(ipx)
^(/‚Ñè) Y

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:23.079
_E2(x).
 

00:51:23.079 --> 00:51:25.657
This function has all the
properties I mentioned,

00:51:25.657 --> 00:51:27.429
namely nothing depends on time.
 

00:51:27.429 --> 00:51:29.840
That has the same property.
 

00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:33.327
But because the
Schrˆdinger equation is a

00:51:33.327 --> 00:51:36.369
linear equation,
it's also true that this

00:51:36.369 --> 00:51:38.853
Y, which is
Y_1

00:51:38.853 --> 00:51:43.440
Y_2,
add this one to this one,

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.800
is also a solution.
 

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.869
I think I have done it many,
many times.

00:51:47.869 --> 00:51:50.128
If you take a linear equation,
Y_1 obeys the

00:51:50.128 --> 00:51:52.324
Schrˆdinger equation,
Y_2 obeys the

00:51:52.324 --> 00:51:53.320
Schrˆdinger equation.
 

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.666
Add the left hand side to the
left hand side and right hand

00:51:55.666 --> 00:51:57.722
side to the right hand side,
you will find that if

00:51:57.722 --> 00:52:00.090
Y_1 obeys it
and Y_2 does,

00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:02.284
Y_1
Y_2 also obeys

00:52:02.284 --> 00:52:02.500
it.
 

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:04.690
Not only that,
it can be even more general.

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:07.889
You can multiply this by any
number,

00:52:07.889 --> 00:52:10.860
Y_1(x,t),
any constant,

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:12.351
A_2
Y_2

00:52:12.351 --> 00:52:13.628
(x,t),
but A_1 and

00:52:13.628 --> 00:52:14.670
A_2 don't
depend on time.

00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:16.519
Also, obeys Schrˆdinger
equation.

00:52:16.519 --> 00:52:17.969
Can you see that?
 

00:52:17.969 --> 00:52:21.179
That's superposition of
solutions.

00:52:21.179 --> 00:52:22.960
It's a property of linear
equations.

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:26.347
Nowhere does Y^(2)
appear in the Schrˆdinger

00:52:26.347 --> 00:52:29.059
equation, therefore you can add
solutions.

00:52:29.059 --> 00:52:32.719
But take a solution of this
form.

00:52:32.719 --> 00:52:34.766
Even though
Y_1 is a

00:52:34.766 --> 00:52:37.210
product of some F and a
Y,

00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:38.690
and Y_2 is a
product of some

00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:40.340
F_2 and
Y_2,

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:45.360
the sum is not a product of
some F and some Y.

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.800
You cannot write it as a
product, you understand?

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:49.536
That's a product,
and that's a product,

00:52:49.536 --> 00:52:52.280
but their sum is not a product,
because you cannot pull out a

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.518
common function of time from the
two of them.

00:52:54.518 --> 00:52:57.659
They have different time
dependence.

00:52:57.659 --> 00:53:01.420
But that is also a solution.
 

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:06.327
In fact, now you can ask
yourself, what is the most

00:53:06.327 --> 00:53:10.940
general solution I can build in
this problem?

00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:14.967
Well, I think you can imagine
that I can now write

00:53:14.967 --> 00:53:20.063
Y(x) and t
as A_EY

00:53:20.063 --> 00:53:23.867
_E(x,t),
sum over all the allowed

00:53:23.867 --> 00:53:24.480
Es.
 

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:28.309
That also satisfies
Schrˆdinger equation.

00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:29.219
Do you agree?
 

00:53:29.219 --> 00:53:31.829
Every term in it satisfies
Schrˆdinger equation.

00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:34.010
You add them all up,
multiply by any constant

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:35.992
A_E,
that also satisfies

00:53:35.992 --> 00:53:37.480
Schrˆdinger equation.
 

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:41.159
So now I'm suddenly
manufacturing more complicated

00:53:41.159 --> 00:53:42.059
solutions.
 

00:53:42.059 --> 00:53:45.210
The original modest goal was to
find a product form,

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:47.827
but once you got the product
form, you find if you add them

00:53:47.827 --> 00:53:49.625
together,
you get a solution that's no

00:53:49.625 --> 00:53:52.179
longer a product of x and
a product of t,

00:53:52.179 --> 00:53:53.730
function of x and a
function of t,

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:55.679
because this guy has one time
dependence;

00:53:55.679 --> 00:53:58.230
another term is a different
time dependence.

00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:00.280
You cannot pull them all out.
 

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:03.137
So we are now manufacturing
solutions that don't look like

00:54:03.137 --> 00:54:03.989
their products.
 

00:54:03.989 --> 00:54:07.239
This is the amazing thing about
solving the linear equation.

00:54:07.239 --> 00:54:10.476
You seem to have very modest
goals when you start with a

00:54:10.476 --> 00:54:12.125
product form,
but in the end,

00:54:12.125 --> 00:54:16.070
you find that you can make up a
linear combination of products.

00:54:16.070 --> 00:54:21.434
Then the only question is,
will it cover every possible

00:54:21.434 --> 00:54:23.820
situation you give me?
 

00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:26.195
In other words,
suppose you come to me with an

00:54:26.195 --> 00:54:27.570
arbitrary initial state.
 

00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:29.322
I don't know anything about it,
and you say,

00:54:29.322 --> 00:54:30.670
"What is its future?"
 

00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:32.268
Can I handle that problem?
 

00:54:32.268 --> 00:54:35.090
And the answer is,
I can, and I'll tell you why

00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:36.010
that is true.
 

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:41.719
Y(x) and t looks
like A_E.

00:54:41.719 --> 00:54:45.945
I'm going to write this more
explicitly as

00:54:45.945 --> 00:54:52.130
Y_E(x)e^(-
ipx/‚Ñè).

00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:56.739
Look at this function now at
t = 0.

00:54:56.739 --> 00:55:01.807
At t = 0,
I get Y(x) and 0

00:55:01.807 --> 00:55:08.420
to be Œ£A_E
Y_E(x).

00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:12.661
In other words,
I can only handle those

00:55:12.661 --> 00:55:17.909
problems whose initial state
looks like this.

00:55:17.909 --> 00:55:23.581
But my question is,
should I feel limited in any

00:55:23.581 --> 00:55:26.599
way by the restriction?
 

00:55:26.599 --> 00:55:27.760
Do you follow what I'm saying?
 

00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:30.090
Maybe I'll say it one more time.
 

00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:34.023
This is the most general
solution I'm able to manufacture

00:55:34.023 --> 00:55:37.335
that looks like this,
A_E

00:55:37.335 --> 00:55:42.130
Y_E(x)e^(-
ipx/‚Ñè).

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:44.858
It's a sum over solution to the
product form with variable,

00:55:44.858 --> 00:55:46.739
each one with a different
coefficient.

00:55:46.739 --> 00:55:49.820
That's also a solution to
Schrˆdinger equation.

00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:53.077
If I take that solution and
say, "What does it do at

00:55:53.077 --> 00:55:54.300
t = 0?"
 

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:56.610
I find it does the following.
 

00:55:56.610 --> 00:56:04.059
At t = 0,
it looks like this.

00:56:04.059 --> 00:56:09.590
So only for initial functions
of this form I have the future.

00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:14.329
But the only is not a big only,
because every function you can

00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:19.070
give me at t = 0 can
always be written in this form.

00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:22.202
It's a mathematical result that
says that just like sines and

00:56:22.202 --> 00:56:25.490
cosines and certain exponentials
are a complete set of functions

00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:27.110
for expanding any function.
 

00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:30.289
The mathematical theory tells
you that the solutions of H

00:56:30.289 --> 00:56:33.487
Y = E Y,
if you assemble all of them,

00:56:33.487 --> 00:56:36.980
can be used to build up an
arbitrary initial function.

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:42.503
That means any initial function
you give me, I can write this

00:56:42.503 --> 00:56:47.659
way, and the future of that
initial state is this guy.

00:56:47.659 --> 00:56:48.329
Yes?
 

00:56:48.329 --> 00:56:52.980
Student: 
&gt;

00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:53.650
Prof: Yes.
 

00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:56.579
Lots of mathematical
restrictions,

00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:58.000
single valued.
 

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.800
Physicists usually don't worry
about those restrictions till of

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:03.579
course they get in trouble.
 

00:57:03.579 --> 00:57:07.230
Then we go crawling back to the
math guys to help us out.

00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:10.512
So just about anything you can
write down, by the way physics

00:57:10.512 --> 00:57:13.630
works, things tend to be
continuous and differentiable.

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:15.639
That's the way natural things
are.

00:57:15.639 --> 00:57:19.280
So for any function we can
think of it is true.

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.766
You go the mathematicians,
they will give you a function

00:57:21.766 --> 00:57:24.025
that is nowhere continuous,
nowhere differentiable,

00:57:24.025 --> 00:57:25.789
nowhere defined,
nowhere something.

00:57:25.789 --> 00:57:28.579
That's what makes them really
happy.

00:57:28.579 --> 00:57:31.929
But they are all functions the
way they've defined it,

00:57:31.929 --> 00:57:33.489
but they don't happen in real
life,

00:57:33.489 --> 00:57:36.144
because whatever happens here
influences what happens on

00:57:36.144 --> 00:57:38.733
either side of it,
so things don't change in a

00:57:38.733 --> 00:57:39.840
discontinuous way.
 

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:41.300
Unless you apply an infinite
force,

00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:43.059
an infinite potential,
infinite something,

00:57:43.059 --> 00:57:45.610
everything has got what's
called C infinity,

00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:47.989
can differentiate any number of
times.

00:57:47.989 --> 00:57:49.449
So we don't worry about the
restriction.

00:57:49.449 --> 00:57:54.094
So in the world of physicists'
functions, you can write any

00:57:54.094 --> 00:57:57.860
initial function in terms of
these functions.

00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:01.242
So let me tell you then the
process for solving the

00:58:01.242 --> 00:58:04.559
Schrˆdinger equation under
any conditions.

00:58:04.559 --> 00:58:05.530
Are you with me?
 

00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:08.269
You come and give me
Y(x, 0),

00:58:08.269 --> 00:58:10.880
and you say,
"As a function of time,

00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:13.360
where is it going to end
up?"

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:14.219
That's your question.
 

00:58:14.219 --> 00:58:15.610
That's all you can ask.
 

00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:17.500
Initial state, final state.
 

00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:23.119
This is given, this is needed.
 

00:58:23.119 --> 00:58:26.079
So I'll give you a 3 step
solution.

00:58:26.079 --> 00:58:36.168
Step 1, find A_E=
Y_E

00:58:36.168 --> 00:58:45.070
*(x)
Y(x,0).

00:58:45.070 --> 00:58:54.164
Step 2, Y(x) and
t = this A_E

00:58:54.164 --> 00:59:00.530
that you got times
e^(-ipx/

00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:08.260
‚Ñè)Y
_E(x).

00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:11.648
So what I'm telling you is,
the fate of a function Y

00:59:11.648 --> 00:59:15.268
with the wiggles and jiggles is
very complicated to explain.

00:59:15.268 --> 00:59:17.704
Some wiggle goes into some
other wiggle that goes into some

00:59:17.704 --> 00:59:19.300
other wiggle as a function of
time,

00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:22.760
but there is a basic simplicity
underlying that evolution.

00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:24.630
The simplicity is the following.
 

00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:29.268
If at t = 0 you expand
your Y as such a sum,

00:59:29.268 --> 00:59:31.800
where the coefficients are
given by the standard rule,

00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:35.719
then as time goes away from
t = 0,

00:59:35.719 --> 00:59:39.545
all you need to do is to
multiply each coefficient by the

00:59:39.545 --> 00:59:43.030
particular term involving that
particular energy.

00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:49.199
And that gives you the Y
at later times.

00:59:49.199 --> 00:59:54.327
A state of definite energy in
this jargon will be the one in

00:59:54.327 --> 00:59:58.498
which every term is absent
except 1, maybe E =

00:59:58.498 --> 01:00:00.409
E_1.
 

01:00:00.409 --> 01:00:02.869
That is the kind we study.
 

01:00:02.869 --> 01:00:06.284
That state has got only 1 term
in the sum and its time

01:00:06.284 --> 01:00:10.021
evolution is simply given by
this and all probabilities are

01:00:10.021 --> 01:00:10.860
constant.
 

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:14.083
But if you mix them up with
different coefficients,

01:00:14.083 --> 01:00:16.920
you can then handle any initial
condition.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:21.786
So we have now solved really
for the future of any quantum

01:00:21.786 --> 01:00:23.579
mechanical problem.
 

01:00:23.579 --> 01:00:28.969
So I'm going to give you from
now to the end of class concrete

01:00:28.969 --> 01:00:30.650
examples of this.
 

01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:35.139
But I don't mind again
answering your questions,

01:00:35.139 --> 01:00:40.869
because it's very hard for me
to put myself in your place.

01:00:40.869 --> 01:00:44.621
So I'm trying to remember when
I did not know quantum

01:00:44.621 --> 01:00:48.228
mechanics, sitting in some
sandbox and some kid was

01:00:48.228 --> 01:00:50.320
throwing sand in my face.
 

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.300
So I don't know.
 

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:55.159
I've lost my innocence and I
don't know how it looks to you.

01:00:55.159 --> 01:00:56.110
Yes.
 

01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:58.079
Student:  For each of
these problems,

01:00:58.079 --> 01:01:00.873
you have to solve that equation
you gave us before to find the

01:01:00.873 --> 01:01:02.340
form of the
Y_E,

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:02.889
right?
 

01:01:02.889 --> 01:01:05.429
Prof: Right.
 

01:01:05.429 --> 01:01:10.219
So let's do the following
problem.

01:01:10.219 --> 01:01:16.909
Let us take a world in which
everything is inside the box of

01:01:16.909 --> 01:01:18.949
length L.
 

01:01:18.949 --> 01:01:24.130
And someone has manufactured
for you a certain state.

01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:26.530
Let me come to that case in a
minute.

01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:29.858
Let me take a simple case then
I'll build up the situation you

01:01:29.858 --> 01:01:30.239
want.
 

01:01:30.239 --> 01:01:35.735
Let's first take a simple case
where at t = 0

01:01:35.735 --> 01:01:40.047
Y(x,0) = the
square root of

01:01:40.047 --> 01:01:45.219
2/Lsine(n
px/L).

01:01:45.219 --> 01:01:51.250
That is just a function with n
oscillations.

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:54.059
You agree, that's a state of
definite energy.

01:01:54.059 --> 01:01:59.068
The energy of that state,
E_n,

01:01:59.068 --> 01:02:03.641
is ‚Ñè^(2)
p^(2)n^(2)/

01:02:03.641 --> 01:02:05.710
2mL^(2).
 

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:08.239
We did that last time.
 

01:02:08.239 --> 01:02:09.699
And the reason,
why were we so interested in

01:02:09.699 --> 01:02:10.309
these functions?
 

01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:12.429
Now I can tell you why.
 

01:02:12.429 --> 01:02:15.460
If this is my initial state,
let me take a particular

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:17.760
n,
then the state at any future

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:21.476
time, Y(x,t),
is very simple here,

01:02:21.476 --> 01:02:24.972
the square root of
2/Lsine(n

01:02:24.972 --> 01:02:29.496
px/L), times
e^(-ipx/

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:33.994
‚Ñè),
where energy is

01:02:33.994 --> 01:02:39.063
n^(2)p
^(2)

01:02:39.063 --> 01:02:45.769
‚Ñè^(2)
/2mL^(2).

01:02:45.769 --> 01:02:46.559
That's it.
 

01:02:46.559 --> 01:02:50.739
That is the function of time.
 

01:02:50.739 --> 01:02:53.637
All I've done to that initial
state is multiply by

01:02:53.637 --> 01:02:56.418
e^(-iEt),
but E is not some random

01:02:56.418 --> 01:02:57.070
number.
 

01:02:57.070 --> 01:03:00.539
E is labeled by n
and E_nis whatever you

01:03:00.539 --> 01:03:01.199
have here.
 

01:03:01.199 --> 01:03:05.010
That's the time dependence of
that state.

01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:09.896
It's very clear that if you
took the absolute value of this

01:03:09.896 --> 01:03:14.699
Y, this guy has absolute
value = 1 at all times.

01:03:14.699 --> 01:03:16.929
It's like saying cos t
depends on time,

01:03:16.929 --> 01:03:20.789
sine t depends on time,
but cos^(2) sine^(2),

01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:23.025
cos^(2 )t sine^(2)
t seems to depend on

01:03:23.025 --> 01:03:25.280
time,
but it doesn't.

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:28.228
So this seems to depend on time
and it does, but when you take

01:03:28.228 --> 01:03:29.920
the absolute value,
it goes away.

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.489
That's the simplest problem.
 

01:03:31.489 --> 01:03:34.875
I gave you an initial state,
the future is very simple,

01:03:34.875 --> 01:03:36.130
attach the factor.
 

01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:39.250
Now let's give you a slightly
more complicated state.

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:44.811
The more complicated state will
be--I'm going to hide that for

01:03:44.811 --> 01:03:45.360
now.
 

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:53.154
Let us take a
Y(x,0) that looks

01:03:53.154 --> 01:04:01.302
like 3 times square root of
2/Lsine(2

01:04:01.302 --> 01:04:08.920
px/L) 4 times
sine...

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:14.889
This is my initial state.
 

01:04:14.889 --> 01:04:16.300
What does it look like?
 

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:19.420
It's a sum of 2 energy states.
 

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:22.690
This guy is what I would call
Y_2 in my

01:04:22.690 --> 01:04:24.889
notation, the second highest
state.

01:04:24.889 --> 01:04:27.670
This guy is
Y_3.

01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:34.411
Everybody is properly
normalized, and these are the

01:04:34.411 --> 01:04:36.030
As.
 

01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:40.103
So this state,
if you measure its energy,

01:04:40.103 --> 01:04:42.139
what will you get?
 

01:04:42.139 --> 01:04:48.030
Anybody tell me what answers I
can get if I measure energy now?

01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:52.260
You want to guess what are the
possible energies I could get?

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:54.199
Yes.
 

01:04:54.199 --> 01:04:57.400
Any of you, either of you.
 

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.650
Can you tell?
 

01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:05.059
No?
 

01:05:05.059 --> 01:05:05.800
Yes?
 

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:10.614
Student:  You can get
h^(2)p^(2) times

01:05:10.614 --> 01:05:13.190
4/2mL^(2),
or times 9.

01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:16.697
Prof: So her answer was,
you can get in my convention

01:05:16.697 --> 01:05:20.260
E_2or
E_3,

01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:22.789
just put n = to 2 0r 3
That's all you have,

01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:26.047
your function written as a sum
over Y_E is

01:05:26.047 --> 01:05:26.889
only 2 terms.
 

01:05:26.889 --> 01:05:29.449
That means they are the only 2
energies you can get.

01:05:29.449 --> 01:05:31.590
So it's not a state of definite
energy.

01:05:31.590 --> 01:05:34.190
You can get either this answer
or this answer.

01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:36.197
But now you can sort of see,
it's more likely to get this

01:05:36.197 --> 01:05:38.019
guy,
because it has a 4 in front of

01:05:38.019 --> 01:05:40.010
it, and less likely to get this
guy,

01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:44.039
and impossible to get anything
else.

01:05:44.039 --> 01:05:52.309
So the probability for getting
n = 2 is proportional to

01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:56.952
3^(2),
and the probability for getting

01:05:56.952 --> 01:06:01.260
n = 3 is proportional to
4^(2).

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:04.000
If you want the absolute
probabilities,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.909
then you can write it as 3^(2)
divided by 3^(2) 4^(2),

01:06:07.909 --> 01:06:15.255
which is 4^(2),
or you can write it as 3^(2)

01:06:15.255 --> 01:06:18.159
4^(2) is 5^(2).
 

01:06:18.159 --> 01:06:21.349
See, if you square these
probabilities,

01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:23.449
you get 25,3^(2) 4^(2).
 

01:06:23.449 --> 01:06:26.614
If you want to get 1,
I think you can see without too

01:06:26.614 --> 01:06:29.766
much trouble,
if you rescale the whole thing

01:06:29.766 --> 01:06:33.146
by 1 fifth,
now you'll find the total

01:06:33.146 --> 01:06:35.780
probabilities add up to 1.
 

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:38.840
That's the way to normalize the
function, that's the easy way.

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:41.646
The hard way is to square all
of this and integrate it and

01:06:41.646 --> 01:06:44.059
then set it = to 1 and see what
you have to do.

01:06:44.059 --> 01:06:46.280
In the end, all you will have
to do is divide by 5.

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:48.329
I'm just giving you a shortcut.
 

01:06:48.329 --> 01:06:51.422
When you expand the Y in
terms of normalized functions,

01:06:51.422 --> 01:06:53.960
then the coefficient squared
should add up to 1.

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:56.063
If they don't,
you just divide them by

01:06:56.063 --> 01:06:57.199
whatever it takes.
 

01:06:57.199 --> 01:07:01.342
So this has got a chance 3 is
to 5 of being this or that

01:07:01.342 --> 01:07:02.018
energy.
 

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:05.436
But as a function of time,
you will find here things vary

01:07:05.436 --> 01:07:06.170
with time.
 

01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:07.610
This is not going to be time
independent.

01:07:07.610 --> 01:07:09.550
I want to show you that.
 

01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:16.322
So Y(x,t) now is
going to be (3/5‚àö(2/L

01:07:16.322 --> 01:07:21.289
))sine(2
px/L) times

01:07:21.289 --> 01:07:24.449
e^(‚àíi(E2)).
 

01:07:24.449 --> 01:07:26.382
I don't want to write the full
formula for E_n

01:07:26.382 --> 01:07:27.039
every time.
 

01:07:27.039 --> 01:07:30.309
I'm just going to call it
E_2,

01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:42.677
(4/5‚àö(2/L))sine
(3px/L) times

01:07:42.677 --> 01:07:50.099
e^(‚àíi(E3)t/√¢¬Ñ¬è.
 

01:07:50.099 --> 01:07:55.661
)Now you notice that if I
found the probability to be at

01:07:55.661 --> 01:07:59.340
sum x,
p(x,t), I have to take the

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:02.639
absolute square of all of this.
 

01:08:02.639 --> 01:08:06.309
And all I want you to notice is
that the absolute square of all

01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:09.268
of this, you cannot drop these
exponentials now.

01:08:09.268 --> 01:08:11.489
If you've got two of them,
you cannot drop them,

01:08:11.489 --> 01:08:13.570
because when you take
Y_1

01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:15.650
Y_2 absolute
squared,

01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:17.538
Y_1
Y_2,

01:08:17.538 --> 01:08:20.086
you multiply it by
Y_1 conjugate

01:08:20.086 --> 01:08:23.479
Y_2 conjugate,
let's do that.

01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:29.060
So you want to multiply the
whole thing by its conjugate.

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:33.750
So first you take the absolute
square of this.

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:39.426
You will get
(9/25)(2/L)sin^(2)(2

01:08:39.426 --> 01:08:42.630
px/L).
 

01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:45.380
And the absolute value of this
is just 1.

01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:46.130
You see that?
 

01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:49.288
That is Y_1*
Y_1.

01:08:49.288 --> 01:08:50.831
Then you must take
Y_2*

01:08:50.831 --> 01:08:51.739
Y_2.
 

01:08:51.739 --> 01:09:00.073
That will be 16/25‚àö(2/L)--
I'm sorry, no square

01:09:00.073 --> 01:09:04.800
root--2/Lsin^(2)(3px/L)
times 1,

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.460
because the absolute value of
this guy with itself is 1.

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:11.090
But that's not the end.
 

01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:15.033
You've got 2 more terms which
look like Y_1

01:09:15.033 --> 01:09:18.546
^(*)Y_2
Y_2*

01:09:18.546 --> 01:09:20.340
Y_1.
 

01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:23.307
I'm not going to work out all
the details, but let me just

01:09:23.307 --> 01:09:25.340
show you that time dependence
exists.

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:26.751
So if you take 
Y_1^(*)

01:09:26.751 --> 01:09:32.645
Y_2,
you will get (3/5‚àö(2/L

01:09:32.645 --> 01:09:40.912
))sine(2
px/L) times e^(

01:09:40.912 --> 01:09:47.560
iE2t/‚Ñè)^( )times--
sorry.

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:53.768
3/5 times
(4/5‚àö(2/L))sine

01:09:53.768 --> 01:10:02.662
(3px/L) times
e^((i(E2)‚àíi(E3)t)

01:10:02.662 --> 01:10:08.198
/‚Ñè) 1 more term.
 

01:10:08.198 --> 01:10:10.380
I don't care about any of these
things.

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:14.282
I'm asking you to see,
do things depend on time or

01:10:14.282 --> 01:10:14.760
not?
 

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:17.387
This has no time dependence
because the absolute value of

01:10:17.387 --> 01:10:18.140
that vanished.
 

01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:20.315
This has no time dependence,
the absolute value of this

01:10:20.315 --> 01:10:20.760
vanished.
 

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:23.506
But the cross terms,
when you multiply the conjugate

01:10:23.506 --> 01:10:25.822
of this by this,
or the conjugate of this by

01:10:25.822 --> 01:10:27.329
that, they don't cancel.
 

01:10:27.329 --> 01:10:29.069
That's all I want you to know.
 

01:10:29.069 --> 01:10:31.729
So I'll get a term like this
this complex conjugate.

01:10:31.729 --> 01:10:33.578
I don't want to write that in
detail.

01:10:33.578 --> 01:10:36.329
If you combine this function
with the conjugate,

01:10:36.329 --> 01:10:39.550
you'll find this the conjugate
will give me a cosine.

01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:54.340
So I should probably write it
on another part of the board.

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:57.304
So maybe I don't even want to
write it because it's in the

01:10:57.304 --> 01:10:57.720
notes.
 

01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:00.828
I want you to notice the
following - look at the first

01:11:00.828 --> 01:11:03.000
term, no time dependence,
second term,

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.350
no time dependence.
 

01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:08.242
The cross term has an e to the
something and I claim the other

01:11:08.242 --> 01:11:11.050
cross term will have e to the -
something.

01:11:11.050 --> 01:11:13.532
e to the i something or
e to the -i something is

01:11:13.532 --> 01:11:14.590
the cosine of something.
 

01:11:14.590 --> 01:11:16.140
That's all I want you to know.
 

01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:21.070
So there is somewhere in the
time dependence P(x,t)

01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:25.569
that's got a lot of stuff which
is t independent,

01:11:25.569 --> 01:11:28.238
something that looks like a
whole bunch of numbers,

01:11:28.238 --> 01:11:34.800
times cosine(E_2 -
E_3)t /‚Ñè.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:38.050
That's all I want you to notice.
 

01:11:38.050 --> 01:11:41.130
That means the probability
density will be oscillating.

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:45.277
The particle will not be fixed;
it will be bouncing back and

01:11:45.277 --> 01:11:46.979
forth between the walls.
 

01:11:46.979 --> 01:11:50.628
And the rate at which it
bounces is given by the

01:11:50.628 --> 01:11:55.287
difference in energy between the
two states you formed in the

01:11:55.287 --> 01:11:56.529
combination.
 

01:11:56.529 --> 01:11:59.229
So this is how a particle in
general--

01:11:59.229 --> 01:12:01.130
if you want,
not the most general one,

01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:04.805
but it's a reasonably general
case where you added some

01:12:04.805 --> 01:12:06.670
mixture of that--
let me see.

01:12:06.670 --> 01:12:08.260
You added 2 to 3.
 

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:13.500
You added that state that state.
 

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:19.027
You added 4 times fifth of that
times 3 fifths of that as the

01:12:19.027 --> 01:12:20.869
initial condition.
 

01:12:20.869 --> 01:12:21.300
Okay?
 

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:24.235
4 fifths of this one guy with 2
wiggles and 3 fifths with 3

01:12:24.235 --> 01:12:26.109
wiggles and you let it go in
time,

01:12:26.109 --> 01:12:29.420
you will find then if you add
these time dependences,

01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:31.149
there'll be a part that varies
with time.

01:12:31.149 --> 01:12:33.260
So the density will not be
constant now.

01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:37.539
It will be sloshing back and
forth in the box.

01:12:37.539 --> 01:12:39.328
That's a more typical situation.
 

01:12:39.328 --> 01:12:41.305
So not every state,
initial state,

01:12:41.305 --> 01:12:44.060
is a function of a state of
definite energy.

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:45.069
It's an admixture.
 

01:12:45.069 --> 01:12:48.203
I've taken the simplest case
where the admixture has only 2

01:12:48.203 --> 01:12:48.960
parts in it.
 

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:51.407
You can imagine taking a
function made of 3 parts and 4

01:12:51.407 --> 01:12:53.944
parts and 10 parts and when you
square them and all that,

01:12:53.944 --> 01:12:55.350
you'll get 100 cross terms.
 

01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:58.760
They'll all be oscillating at
different rates.

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:04.399
But the frequencies will always
be given by the difference in

01:13:04.399 --> 01:13:09.570
frequencies, differences in
energies that went into your

01:13:09.570 --> 01:13:10.698
mixture.
 

01:13:10.698 --> 01:13:12.550
The last problem which I'm not
going to do now,

01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:14.679
I'll do next time,
but I'll tell you what it is I

01:13:14.679 --> 01:13:16.319
want to do,
which is really this

01:13:16.319 --> 01:13:19.698
mathematically more involved,
but the idea is the same.

01:13:19.698 --> 01:13:22.380
Here I gave you the initial
state on a plate.

01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:24.631
I just said,
here it is, 3 fifths times 1

01:13:24.631 --> 01:13:27.953
function of definite energy,
4 fifths times another function

01:13:27.953 --> 01:13:29.250
of definite energy.
 

01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:32.166
The problem you really want to
be able to solve right now is

01:13:32.166 --> 01:13:34.784
when somebody gives you an
arbitrary initial state and

01:13:34.784 --> 01:13:37.060
says,
"What happens to it?"

01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:42.322
So I'm going to consider next
time a function that looks

01:13:42.322 --> 01:13:47.488
something like this - x
times 1 - x is my

01:13:47.488 --> 01:13:49.689
function at time 0.
 

01:13:49.689 --> 01:13:52.619
That's a nice function,
because it vanishes at 0,

01:13:52.619 --> 01:13:53.779
it vanishes at 1.
 

01:13:53.779 --> 01:13:56.600
It's a box of length L =
1.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:00.800
It's an allowed initial state.
 

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.800
Then I can ask,
what does this do.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:06.180
So you should think about how
do I predict its future,

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:07.328
what's involved?
 

01:14:07.328 --> 01:14:09.670
So you will see that in the
notes.

01:14:09.670 --> 01:14:13.144
So what I'm going to do next
time is to finish this problem

01:14:13.144 --> 01:14:15.779
and give you the final set of
postulates,

01:14:15.779 --> 01:14:18.800
so that you can see what the
rules of quantum mechanics are.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:24.000

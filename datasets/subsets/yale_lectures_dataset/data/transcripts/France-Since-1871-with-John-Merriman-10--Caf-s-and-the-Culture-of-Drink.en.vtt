00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.388
Professor John Merriman:
So, the subject is drink

00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:08.020
and in particular drinking too
much.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.884
And I want to make a very
obvious point that drink and

00:00:11.884 --> 00:00:14.510
drinking, for better or for
worse,

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.756
often for the latter,
is closely tied to the economy,

00:00:19.756 --> 00:00:22.380
political life,
culture,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.730
and social life,
sociability,

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.598
of France, and that this has
always been the case as a wine

00:00:29.598 --> 00:00:33.040
producing country and a country
that,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.694
in the course--over the
centuries produced lots of other

00:00:36.694 --> 00:00:41.900
alcohol as well.
So, let's get going on that.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.710
Here I've drawn on the work of
an old friend of mine,

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.008
Susannah Barrows,
who studied aspects of this,

00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:51.720
and lots of other people as
well;

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.167
and in addition some probably a
firsthand experience,

00:00:56.167 --> 00:01:01.129
not about drinking too much,
of course, but about living in

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.392
France.
In 1934 the President of

00:01:04.392 --> 00:01:10.200
France, a quite forgettable
character called Albert Lebrun,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.229
said that wine "does not only
confer health and vigor to those

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.699
people who are drinking it,
it has soothing properties that

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:23.389
both ensure the rational
equilibrium of the organism and

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:26.610
create a predisposition to
harmony among men;

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.408
in addition it can be,
in difficult times,

00:01:29.408 --> 00:01:33.640
it can pour confidence and hope
into our hesitating hearts."

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.750
One of course thinks of
Pétain increasing the rum

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.418
ration at Verdun in 1916 and the
regular rounds of doing shots

00:01:44.418 --> 00:01:47.950
before you went over the
trenches,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.340
the hesitating hearts soon dead
hearts.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.263
There has been in France,
a very long time from about the

00:01:57.263 --> 00:02:03.081
1880s really into the early
'90s, 1990s, a denial of the

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:06.902
problem of drinking.
This is not only France,

00:02:06.902 --> 00:02:09.520
Poland, of course,
which has even a higher rate of

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.620
alcoholism--I spend a lot of
time in Poland these days,

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.210
and it's really kind of
amazing--and in Russia as well.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.369
But, because of the identity of
France and its national identity

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.967
with products of quality,
with fine wines,

00:02:26.967 --> 00:02:30.262
with fine Bordeaux,
with fine Burgundy,

00:02:30.262 --> 00:02:35.117
this denial became rather
easier and the people who drank

00:02:35.117 --> 00:02:40.840
too much were not drinking fine
Burgundies and fine Bordeaux,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.844
nor are they today.
In 1875 Barrows discovered that

00:02:45.844 --> 00:02:50.026
the Grand Dictionnairen du XIXe
Siècle informed its

00:02:50.026 --> 00:02:52.979
readers that,
in quote, "in our country

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:57.179
although drunkenness is not
unknown, it is far from having a

00:02:57.179 --> 00:03:01.379
character as repellent and as
nefarious as in England and as

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.211
in America."
Now, one of the reasons why a

00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:07.733
dictionary consulted by so many
zillions of people over the ages

00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:10.976
could throw out such a line is
because there's been a close

00:03:10.976 --> 00:03:13.939
identification with people
drinking too much in,

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:18.658
particularly the lower classes,
in Britain, with drinking hard

00:03:18.658 --> 00:03:23.221
liquor, gin--that is in Hogarth
and the prints--and not just

00:03:23.221 --> 00:03:27.341
getting wasted on beer.
And the United States,

00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:32.788
as Louis-Philippe himself found
out, the drink of choice was

00:03:32.788 --> 00:03:37.220
bourbon and various whiskies,
as in Scotland.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.181
So, wine seemed to be okay.
And in England where the

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:48.671
Temperance Movement closely tied
to organized religion was

00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:53.784
terribly important,
and in the Scandinavian states,

00:03:53.784 --> 00:03:59.385
and in Germany the Temperance
Movement was but a small dike

00:03:59.385 --> 00:04:05.520
put up against the waves,
the hurricane like waves of

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.995
drink.
Now, wine has always been

00:04:09.995 --> 00:04:16.879
produced in France for centuries
and centuries.

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:20.173
There is a wine called Cornas,
c-o-r-n-a-s,

00:04:20.173 --> 00:04:23.779
that's produced down here in
Ardèche,

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:26.292
quite near the Rhône,
that's a very dark

00:04:26.292 --> 00:04:28.750
costaud,
en français,

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.399
a very hearty red wine that has
to be sat down for a long time,

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:38.050
that one of the Roman poets
discussed in some Roman century,

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.879
B.C.
century.

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:45.233
In that particular region
people had to produce wine,

00:04:45.233 --> 00:04:48.324
most of it was bad wine,
in order to trade the wine for

00:04:48.324 --> 00:04:51.199
something to eat because the
region, that particular region,

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.839
called the Vivarais--it doesn't
matter--couldn't produce very

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:55.600
much at all because of the rocky
soil,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.548
and so they would trade their
rather bad wine for lentils,

00:04:59.548 --> 00:05:02.180
for example,
produced around Le Puy,

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.730
higher up--it doesn't matter,
the details don't matter.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.160
So, wine had always been
produced.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.012
But wine was fairly expensive
and so people,

00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:16.850
as we'll see in awhile,
began to drink other things.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.770
Bordeaux wines were well known
in England, and thus in Britain

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.046
they refer to red wine as a
claret and the reason that

00:05:26.046 --> 00:05:31.290
Burgundy wines were not well
known in Britain is fairly easy,

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.442
just look at a map.
Bordeaux, dangerous trips

00:05:34.442 --> 00:05:37.684
across--around France,
around Brittany,

00:05:37.684 --> 00:05:41.779
would end up wines arriving in
British ports;

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:45.522
whereas, for example,
in Belgium when people drink

00:05:45.522 --> 00:05:50.027
great wines or very good wines
they tend to drink Burgundies

00:05:50.027 --> 00:05:53.769
because of the way the lay of
the land works.

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:57.445
But what's interesting about,
and what fits right into what

00:05:57.445 --> 00:06:00.506
we're talking about,
is where people drank,

00:06:00.506 --> 00:06:03.839
because obviously the role of
the café

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:06.870
is so fundamental in French
economic,

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.009
political, social,
and cultural life.

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:12.980
There's just--any aspect you
think of modern France,

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.066
particularly in the Third
Republic, is closely tied to

00:06:16.066 --> 00:06:18.925
that institution.
Impressionist painting,

00:06:18.925 --> 00:06:20.560
for example,
the role of

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.040
café-concert where
you could go and be entertained

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:31.180
as you drank,
is important in Impressionism;

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.826
or paintings of the coast,
of the Normand coast by

00:06:34.826 --> 00:06:37.579
Morisseau and lots of other
people.

00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:42.348
Drink is totally prevalent,
and Degas and all of the other

00:06:42.348 --> 00:06:46.949
ones, there was just the
preoccupation with absinthe,

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:53.389
for example--more about that in
awhile--which has just been made

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:56.319
legal again,
within the last couple of years.

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:00.566
Cafés are where deals
did used to get done and where

00:07:00.566 --> 00:07:04.730
deals still get done;
or, if you're living in a large

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.730
city, in a world of apartments,
people will tend,

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.684
the first time they'll invite
you will be to a café,

00:07:12.684 --> 00:07:16.827
often not to their own home.
But just as restaurants--which

00:07:16.827 --> 00:07:20.742
I'll talk about at the end,
if there's time--cafés

00:07:20.742 --> 00:07:23.702
themselves are relatively,
in French history,

00:07:23.702 --> 00:07:26.123
a recent phenomenon.
Even the word café,

00:07:26.123 --> 00:07:27.970
a café,
what is café?

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:32.932
Well, café
is coffee, and it is with the

00:07:32.932 --> 00:07:39.189
arrival of coffees from the new
world that becomes the real

00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:41.979
rage,
the real hit of the eighteenth

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:45.617
century and the emergence in
Britain of the coffeehouse where

00:07:45.617 --> 00:07:48.772
politics is done.
We use, and I use today,

00:07:48.772 --> 00:07:52.980
café to be a generic
place where one drinks,

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.611
but in fact in the period that
we're considering,

00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:57.750
at the end of the nineteenth
century,

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.186
people were clever enough to
realize that--and aware of their

00:08:01.186 --> 00:08:04.566
surroundings enough--to know
that the cafés are where

00:08:04.566 --> 00:08:08.044
the wealthy people went,
on the big boulevards of Paris

00:08:08.044 --> 00:08:10.980
or on the Rue de la
République in Lyon,

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:15.320
or in the fancy neighborhoods
of almost every large city,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.739
and ordinary people went to
drink in places where they did

00:08:19.739 --> 00:08:24.389
not often serve café
because it was so expensive,

00:08:24.389 --> 00:08:26.671
and if they did it was a fairly
rare thing because café

00:08:26.671 --> 00:08:29.479
was expensive;
drink, as we'll see in awhile,

00:08:29.479 --> 00:08:33.031
cost absolutely nothing.
And even the names--I just

00:08:33.031 --> 00:08:34.743
picked a few,
six or seven,

00:08:34.743 --> 00:08:37.179
and nobody's responsible for
this,

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:40.585
except maybe the French people
would like to think about

00:08:40.585 --> 00:08:43.990
this--just kind of describe
where people go to drink.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.733
It varies from region to region
often, but let me just go

00:08:46.733 --> 00:08:48.502
through this briefly.
A café,

00:08:48.502 --> 00:08:51.209
well I've already said that,
and how they change because the

00:08:51.209 --> 00:08:53.549
days of the flipper
machine are all gone,

00:08:53.549 --> 00:08:55.835
the pinball machine and all
that, it just changes,

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:58.073
and my God, now there's
Starbucks--I have nothing

00:08:58.073 --> 00:09:01.042
against Starbucks,
do I?--I don't know--but have

00:09:01.042 --> 00:09:04.391
arrived in Paris now,
and that's as much of a shock

00:09:04.391 --> 00:09:07.487
and,
dare I say, blow as the arrival

00:09:07.487 --> 00:09:10.370
of McDonalds all those years
ago.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.992
But, anyway,
a cabaret, when you think of

00:09:11.992 --> 00:09:14.263
cabaret you think of the
cabaret, and you think of people

00:09:14.263 --> 00:09:16.495
dancing,
and you think of Berlin in the

00:09:16.495 --> 00:09:19.839
1920s or something like that.
But a cabaret was a place where

00:09:19.839 --> 00:09:22.779
ordinary people went to drink,
that's what a cabaret is.

00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:26.889
An estaminet is simply a word
for the same thing,

00:09:26.889 --> 00:09:31.769
but in the north of France an
estaminet you wouldn't go to

00:09:31.769 --> 00:09:34.359
Agen,
you wouldn't go to Marseille,

00:09:34.359 --> 00:09:36.429
and ask for the local
estaminet.

00:09:36.429 --> 00:09:39.685
A guinguette is
sort of a rural place that you

00:09:39.685 --> 00:09:42.499
would drink, and again I'm
thinking of Impressionist

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:45.644
paintings that you might have
seen with the role of people

00:09:45.644 --> 00:09:49.569
going out there on Sunday,
both males, unattached males

00:09:49.569 --> 00:09:53.809
looking for unattached females
and families going out,

00:09:53.809 --> 00:09:57.267
along the Marne,
which in the 1920s and '30s,

00:09:57.267 --> 00:10:00.882
outside of Paris,
was a real hot place to go--a

00:10:00.882 --> 00:10:03.789
guinguette was very
rural.

00:10:03.789 --> 00:10:05.809
A bouchon,
the word in French

00:10:05.809 --> 00:10:08.855
bouchon means a cork;
it also means a traffic jam,

00:10:08.855 --> 00:10:11.345
as a cork in a bottle is a
traffic jam, nobody can get

00:10:11.345 --> 00:10:13.600
through because it's
bouchonné,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.513
or a wine can be
bouchonné,

00:10:15.513 --> 00:10:16.561
too.
But, anyway,

00:10:16.561 --> 00:10:19.227
a bouchon is a rural
drinking place,

00:10:19.227 --> 00:10:22.146
and when I think of
bouchon I think of a

00:10:22.146 --> 00:10:25.890
place where you go with your
friends and maybe play a little

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.211
boule,
along side of that,

00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:35.799
and it's sort of identity with
leisure but seeking the outside

00:10:35.799 --> 00:10:42.222
of the city,
to find some greenery on a

00:10:42.222 --> 00:10:44.958
Sunday.
And you think of Lyon,

00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.360
for example,
of the all the Lyonnais at the

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.620
end of the nineteenth century
going across the Rhône

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.422
River to a working-class
faubourg called La

00:10:53.422 --> 00:10:56.637
Guillotière,
and then going further out in

00:10:56.637 --> 00:11:00.093
these places like Brotot--it
doesn't matter--but where it's

00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:03.311
just full of places to drink.
Or chambrays,

00:11:03.311 --> 00:11:08.660
a chambray is a form of a place
of male sociability;

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:14.225
women did not go there usually.
It was sort of a club where you

00:11:14.225 --> 00:11:17.919
drank essentially tax free booze
on the sly,

00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:19.763
and it's more,
it's identified particularly

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:21.299
with a department called the
Var,

00:11:21.299 --> 00:11:24.057
v-a-r, which is-- you don't
have to remember,

00:11:24.057 --> 00:11:27.064
obviously, that--but which is
where Toulon is and

00:11:27.064 --> 00:11:30.078
Saint-Tropez.
And they were important because

00:11:30.078 --> 00:11:32.970
in the Second Republic,
that is 1848 to 1851,

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.008
this is one of the places where
politics sort of came to very

00:11:36.008 --> 00:11:40.071
ordinary people.
So, but what you have is an

00:11:40.071 --> 00:11:46.139
expansion of these places that's
simply phenomenal.

00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:52.218
And it's hard to say--I guess
it's more accurate to say that

00:11:52.218 --> 00:11:58.090
the expansion in the production
of wine helps generate the

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:06.356
expansion of places to drink,
along with the expansion of the

00:12:06.356 --> 00:12:11.559
population itself.
Between 1840 and 1875 the

00:12:11.559 --> 00:12:15.644
amount of wine produced in
France doubled--now,

00:12:15.644 --> 00:12:20.972
this is the same time as the
population is stagnating--and in

00:12:20.972 --> 00:12:25.767
part this is because there are
better roads and there's

00:12:25.767 --> 00:12:31.450
railways to carry wine that's
produced to far off places.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.440
But regions that hadn't
traditionally produced much

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.472
wine, for example,
Corbières and

00:12:38.472 --> 00:12:40.503
Roussillon,
way down here,

00:12:40.503 --> 00:12:43.957
that is north of Perpignan,
around Perpignan and then north

00:12:43.957 --> 00:12:47.019
of Perpignan,
begin producing lots of wine;

00:12:47.019 --> 00:12:49.859
and Languedoc,
that is this region down here

00:12:49.859 --> 00:12:53.887
becomes a massive producer of
wine, that is around Montpellier

00:12:53.887 --> 00:12:58.370
and all that.
So, more and more people are

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:02.690
dependent upon wine for getting
by.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.086
And, as a matter of fact,
there are lots of people who

00:13:05.086 --> 00:13:07.799
worked, who worked the fields
during the various harvests,

00:13:07.799 --> 00:13:10.678
are paid in wine as part of
their salary,

00:13:10.678 --> 00:13:14.779
as opposed--and have to take
those kinds of conditions.

00:13:14.779 --> 00:13:17.411
And then of course you can't
carry a lot of wine with you,

00:13:17.411 --> 00:13:20.320
so you end up getting--drinking
a lot of it wherever you can.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.625
And then of course what comes
along, and this is part of these

00:13:24.625 --> 00:13:29.072
blows against the rural economy
in the Third Republic that helps

00:13:29.072 --> 00:13:33.519
also explain why the rural
population begins to depopulate,

00:13:33.519 --> 00:13:36.928
why rural France begins to
depopulate--remember two-thirds

00:13:36.928 --> 00:13:39.140
of the
départements have

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.967
smaller populations in 1939 than
they did in 1871--is along comes

00:13:42.967 --> 00:13:46.777
the phylloxera disease here,
the phylloxera disease,

00:13:46.777 --> 00:13:51.179
which starts in the late 1870s.
And it comes after another

00:13:51.179 --> 00:13:55.707
disease, it doesn't matter the
name, the pébrine

00:13:55.707 --> 00:13:58.750
which attacks the silkworm
production.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.951
So, it just devastates,
it devastates particularly this

00:14:01.951 --> 00:14:04.734
part of France.
But there isn't any place that

00:14:04.734 --> 00:14:07.870
produced wine that isn't
affected by the phylloxera.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:10.495
And Louis Pasteur,
a name of whom you've

00:14:10.495 --> 00:14:13.389
certainly--you've heard of Louis
Pasteur,

00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:16.965
he does a lot of his work
trying to study the origins of

00:14:16.965 --> 00:14:21.190
this wine blight as well as the
origins of the silkworm blight,

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.904
that are these little--begin as
little taches,

00:14:23.904 --> 00:14:25.940
they're little spots on the
silkworm;

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:30.554
and phylloxera is basically a
disease that attacks the sap,

00:14:30.554 --> 00:14:34.850
that attacks the kind of roots
of--in the vineyards.

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:40.263
And ironically what resolves
the problem is they started

00:14:40.263 --> 00:14:45.479
planting American roots,
plants, that are resistant to

00:14:45.479 --> 00:14:48.899
the phylloxera.
And somebody told me recently

00:14:48.899 --> 00:14:51.410
that California wine is now
facing phylloxera.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:55.908
I'd heard that.
I don't know much about

00:14:55.908 --> 00:14:59.696
California wine.
But what this does is it just

00:14:59.696 --> 00:15:03.289
absolutely devastates wine
production in France.

00:15:03.289 --> 00:15:07.181
And one of the results is that
when the wine crops begin to

00:15:07.181 --> 00:15:10.699
bounce back, in the 1890s,
that many places that produced

00:15:10.699 --> 00:15:13.431
wine simply stopped producing
wine because it's not

00:15:13.431 --> 00:15:15.840
rentable,
you can't make any money on it.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.039
I'll give you a couple of
examples.

00:15:17.039 --> 00:15:20.344
Brittany, it's hard to imagine
wine being produced in Brittany,

00:15:20.344 --> 00:15:23.009
outside of a very ordinary wine
called Muscadet,

00:15:23.009 --> 00:15:25.230
a white wine,
right on the edge,

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.809
and some just god-awful reds
also.

00:15:27.809 --> 00:15:30.877
But basically that all stops,
the production of wine up in

00:15:30.877 --> 00:15:33.029
the north stops,
wherever is possible,

00:15:33.029 --> 00:15:37.138
with the big exception
obviously of Champagne,

00:15:37.138 --> 00:15:42.708
here, and in other places the
production of wine is really cut

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:45.310
back.
But this is a big blow to the

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:48.564
rural economy and lots of people
abandon their fields,

00:15:48.564 --> 00:15:51.019
or they're converted to other
things.

00:15:51.019 --> 00:15:55.952
But wine bounces back and takes
its place again as one of the

00:15:55.952 --> 00:15:59.570
real dynamic forces in modern
French life.

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:03.075
But what's incredible is that
the number of cafés

00:16:03.075 --> 00:16:05.370
continues to expand
exponentially.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:08.364
And this suggests--an obvious
point is that people drank more

00:16:08.364 --> 00:16:10.659
than just wine--more about that
in a minute.

00:16:10.659 --> 00:16:13.514
Let's give you some
suggestions, some ideas,

00:16:13.514 --> 00:16:17.258
some figures.
1790, Paris only had 4,000

00:16:17.258 --> 00:16:23.072
cabarets, 4,000 cabarets in a
town then of about 600,000

00:16:23.072 --> 00:16:29.412
people, more or less.
In 1830 places that had

00:16:29.412 --> 00:16:38.669
licenses to serve alcohol in
France, 282,000 in France.

00:16:38.669 --> 00:16:42.623
Now, let me add one thing
though, having a license to sell

00:16:42.623 --> 00:16:46.577
alcohol, one of the things that
really basically no longer

00:16:46.577 --> 00:16:50.878
exists anymore but existed until
the 1960s was places where you

00:16:50.878 --> 00:16:55.039
did other things but you could
also buy a drink--well,

00:16:55.039 --> 00:16:57.445
I mean I still--I've been in
grocery stores that still are

00:16:57.445 --> 00:16:59.007
cafés,
or cafés that are

00:16:59.007 --> 00:17:00.779
converted into grocery stores as
well.

00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:04.970
But let me give you a ghoulish
example.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.500
I'll talk later about
Oradour-sur-Glane,

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.549
about the massacre there on the
10th of June,

00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:14.533
1944, by the SS and where they
simply kill everybody in the

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:16.661
village.
And when you go to this sacred

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:18.823
site to see what they left
standing, which was

00:17:18.823 --> 00:17:21.753
everything--you'll notice there
are all these places that were

00:17:21.753 --> 00:17:24.539
barbershops that were also
part-time drinking places.

00:17:24.539 --> 00:17:26.806
I had a barber,
my barber in Paris--I don't go

00:17:26.806 --> 00:17:29.526
to the barber that much,
but he was kind of a buddy and

00:17:29.526 --> 00:17:31.390
he was on the Ile on Saint
Louis,

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:35.047
and you had to get to him early
because if you got there late

00:17:35.047 --> 00:17:37.486
he'd already had five,
six, or seven,

00:17:37.486 --> 00:17:40.904
or maybe ten beers,
and you kind of look even more

00:17:40.904 --> 00:17:43.859
damaged than I do.
I tried to outfox him once.

00:17:43.859 --> 00:17:47.637
I made a rendezvous for 8:30 in
the morning, because he starts

00:17:47.637 --> 00:17:51.476
at nine, and I got there and he
was already-- he'd been at that

00:17:51.476 --> 00:17:54.654
bar quite a long a time,
a bar that we called the Annex,

00:17:54.654 --> 00:17:56.890
because that was sort of the
annex of his shop.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:58.370
But, anyway,
when you see this horribly

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:00.279
ghoulish place,
because of what happened there,

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:02.780
and they left everything the
way it is, you see these

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.803
part-time half grocery stores,
half drinking places,

00:18:05.803 --> 00:18:08.630
half barbershops,
half drinking places.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.765
A bougnat,
I can remember in the Marais,

00:18:11.765 --> 00:18:14.220
the center part of the Right
Bank,

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:17.012
I can remember right down the
street from a place that we

00:18:17.012 --> 00:18:20.074
lived for a long time,
and not even that far from our

00:18:20.074 --> 00:18:23.057
apartment, the last
bougnat of the quarter

00:18:23.057 --> 00:18:26.916
and you bought coal there,
coal, and you bought drink

00:18:26.916 --> 00:18:29.353
there.
So, these places that are

00:18:29.353 --> 00:18:32.970
licensed to sell drink cover all
sorts of things,

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:37.415
they're not just your basic
café with the red sign or

00:18:37.415 --> 00:18:39.995
whatever,
the big flashing neon sign or

00:18:39.995 --> 00:18:41.890
the small ones you can barely
read;

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:46.839
but the number is incredible.
Okay, 1865, this does not count

00:18:46.839 --> 00:18:48.659
places in Paris,
this is in France,

00:18:48.659 --> 00:18:50.799
a country that's the size of
Montana,

00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:53.460
a little bigger,
slightly more populated of

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.681
course.
1830 there are 282,000 in

00:18:56.681 --> 00:19:01.210
France;
1865 351,000;

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:09.066
1900 435,000;
and then they count Paris the

00:19:09.066 --> 00:19:12.960
first time the next year,
464,000;

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:18.300
1937 half a million places to
drink;

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:25.477
and in 1953 a mere 439,000.
Now, this represents for every

00:19:25.477 --> 00:19:31.539
man, woman and child one bar for
every ninety-seven inhabitants,

00:19:31.539 --> 00:19:34.192
one place, a bar,
a generic bar for every

00:19:34.192 --> 00:19:37.109
ninety-seven inhabitants,
counting babies,

00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:41.361
counting old ladies who could
put them down too--maybe more

00:19:41.361 --> 00:19:46.200
about that in a minute--compared
to one for every 225 for Italy;

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:52.477
one for every 273 for Germany;
and one for every 425 for

00:19:52.477 --> 00:19:54.592
England.
Now, also just an aside,

00:19:54.592 --> 00:19:57.376
I got to concentrate on going
ahead or I'll just--every time

00:19:57.376 --> 00:19:59.730
I'll go off on an aside,
but if you go to Alsace,

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:01.845
you don't find cafés in
the French sense,

00:20:01.845 --> 00:20:04.140
they're really some of more
like wistubs,

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.827
they're sort of drinking places
and they look like German

00:20:06.827 --> 00:20:09.036
drinking places,
they're more influenced by the

00:20:09.036 --> 00:20:12.836
culture there.
So, this is a huge number of

00:20:12.836 --> 00:20:15.819
places to drink.
But it's also regionally

00:20:15.819 --> 00:20:17.469
specific.
Oh, here's another good word

00:20:17.469 --> 00:20:19.726
for you, for those people,
in French, and I'm not trying

00:20:19.726 --> 00:20:22.160
to exclude the others at all,
but it's just kind of fun to

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.957
talk about.
This is more of--well it's a

00:20:24.957 --> 00:20:28.929
Parisian but--I'll go to my
zinc to have a

00:20:28.929 --> 00:20:33.054
drink--zinc means zinc,
like the metal,

00:20:33.054 --> 00:20:38.726
and because in a poor cabaret
or a poor bar it's not copper or

00:20:38.726 --> 00:20:42.111
something like,
ladi-da like that--those were

00:20:42.111 --> 00:20:45.476
things like the Café
American and the sort of sense

00:20:45.476 --> 00:20:48.959
of luxury being associated in
the 1890s with the British and

00:20:48.959 --> 00:20:52.218
American world.
Mon zinc is my sort of

00:20:52.218 --> 00:20:56.160
grungy bar where I have my place
at the bar, which is,

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.914
depending on how long you've
been there, will be near where

00:20:58.914 --> 00:21:01.417
the patronne,
where the woman working the

00:21:01.417 --> 00:21:03.942
cash register is.
We used to go to a place for

00:21:03.942 --> 00:21:07.435
ages, in fact that's where I was
married, I was married here in,

00:21:07.435 --> 00:21:09.319
what's that place,
Dwight Hall.

00:21:09.319 --> 00:21:11.668
And then we went--we had the
reception here and then we went

00:21:11.668 --> 00:21:13.938
to France and the café
that we'd been going to--I'd

00:21:13.938 --> 00:21:16.167
been going to for a very long
time closed the café

00:21:16.167 --> 00:21:17.759
and had a little reception for
us,

00:21:17.759 --> 00:21:19.920
right across from the National
Archives.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.730
And I'd been in there so long
that I moved up the ladder.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:27.173
So, when I went in there my
place was right next to the--no,

00:21:27.173 --> 00:21:29.741
I'm not saying I was drinking a
lot of stuff,

00:21:29.741 --> 00:21:31.960
I was just there for
conversation.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.319
You know me well enough already
to know that was the case.

00:21:34.319 --> 00:21:38.758
But there's this sort of
hierarchy there that has to do

00:21:38.758 --> 00:21:42.950
with your association with that
particular place.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:47.011
And that was a very typical
place in that the couple were

00:21:47.011 --> 00:21:50.130
from Auvergne,
that is in central France,

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:52.260
born in misery,
la misère,

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.592
thirteen children--I mentioned
them before once--and twelve in

00:21:55.592 --> 00:21:57.826
the other case,
and they had got the money

00:21:57.826 --> 00:22:00.358
together because they had a
neighbor who had no children

00:22:00.358 --> 00:22:02.752
that loaned them the money to
get on the--kind of the

00:22:02.752 --> 00:22:04.640
equivalent of the Web in those
days,

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.746
and to buy a café
from another person from

00:22:07.746 --> 00:22:11.759
Auvergne, and then they worked
there every day from five in the

00:22:11.759 --> 00:22:15.310
morning until nine at night.
Now they're gone and it's sort

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.227
of a chic and ridiculous place.
But these places,

00:22:18.227 --> 00:22:21.609
these zincs were ones
that you had.

00:22:21.609 --> 00:22:24.149
And you never went to the one
across the street,

00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:26.128
never, never.
I would go to another place in

00:22:26.128 --> 00:22:28.153
the Marais and I used to
start--I started going there

00:22:28.153 --> 00:22:29.750
because Jean Jaurès went
there,

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.942
and because Trotsky had been
there, and it was called La

00:22:32.942 --> 00:22:36.059
Tartine, and it's still there,
and that's a very different one

00:22:36.059 --> 00:22:38.049
because all the--now it's also
become very chic,

00:22:38.049 --> 00:22:39.931
very bougie,
very ridiculous,

00:22:39.931 --> 00:22:43.049
and with the Bush dollar
unaffordable for almost anyone.

00:22:43.049 --> 00:22:46.000
Anyway, so, but it's regionally
specific.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.243
In the Nord,
which you already know about,

00:22:48.243 --> 00:22:51.090
there was one bar for every
forty-six inhabitants.

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:54.539
That's amazing.
And you compare that to

00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:58.670
Elboeuf, which is a town in
Normandy, one for every sixty.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.272
Béziers,
way down in the south of

00:23:01.272 --> 00:23:04.008
France, which had a lower
alcoholism rate,

00:23:04.008 --> 00:23:07.612
by the way, Béziers,
there was one for every 120

00:23:07.612 --> 00:23:10.243
people.
So, it tends to be very

00:23:10.243 --> 00:23:12.774
specific.
But again this is babies too,

00:23:12.774 --> 00:23:16.364
and of course everybody has
heard those horror stories about

00:23:16.364 --> 00:23:19.003
young mothers in the 1950s,
and the 1930s,

00:23:19.003 --> 00:23:21.444
and the 1890s,
their baby is crying all the

00:23:21.444 --> 00:23:22.803
time;
well, you get a little

00:23:22.803 --> 00:23:24.914
baguette, a little piece of
bread, and dip it in some

00:23:24.914 --> 00:23:27.351
brandy,
and stuff that bread in the

00:23:27.351 --> 00:23:30.361
baby's mouth,
and there's a smiling happy

00:23:30.361 --> 00:23:34.279
baby and they get some sleep.
Is that disastrous, or what?

00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:36.323
It's absolutely terrible,
and they have to have these

00:23:36.323 --> 00:23:40.002
huge campaigns against all this.
But basically babies didn't

00:23:40.002 --> 00:23:43.589
drink.
Older people did for sure.

00:23:43.589 --> 00:23:46.938
There's this woman that used to
come into--even the terms of

00:23:46.938 --> 00:23:49.771
what they would drink.
You'd go down in the morning--I

00:23:49.771 --> 00:23:52.620
have my coffee before I go to
work at the Archives and really

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.516
a coffee,
nothing else--and there'd be

00:23:54.516 --> 00:23:56.412
this rather elderly lady in
there, une

00:23:56.412 --> 00:23:58.154
mémère,
comme on dit en

00:23:58.154 --> 00:24:00.211
français,
and she would be tossing down a

00:24:00.211 --> 00:24:02.531
petite blancette,
which is a little glass of

00:24:02.531 --> 00:24:04.568
white wine, and she would call
the drink her

00:24:04.568 --> 00:24:07.151
gloria--now,
that's mocking the church,

00:24:07.151 --> 00:24:09.820
because a gloria,
what you sing and what other

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.369
people were singing in the Mass
I guess,

00:24:12.369 --> 00:24:15.006
gloria in excelsis dei
or whatever they sang,

00:24:15.006 --> 00:24:18.249
and she would have her gloria,
right there at her zinc,

00:24:18.249 --> 00:24:21.069
and she'd knock a couple of
those babies down and go off

00:24:21.069 --> 00:24:24.308
with her little shopping bag,
maybe lurching and trying to

00:24:24.308 --> 00:24:27.676
avoid the sixty-eight bus as it
roars by, and she was out of

00:24:27.676 --> 00:24:28.190
there.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.931
Again, I said,
I'm making fun of this a little

00:24:34.931 --> 00:24:37.046
bit but it's sad because you'd
see all these people just

00:24:37.046 --> 00:24:38.684
blotto.
There was a guy at our bar

00:24:38.684 --> 00:24:40.832
called Jean, and he was kind of
a marginal guy,

00:24:40.832 --> 00:24:43.180
and he disappeared.
And, so, people in the bar--I

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.321
wasn't there then,
I was down working at another

00:24:45.321 --> 00:24:47.690
place--but people went out and
tried to find him,

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:51.750
because he was on the Spree,
as you say--that's a term that

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:54.567
comes from Berlin,
I guess when soldiers would get

00:24:54.567 --> 00:24:57.128
all drunked up during the
occupation and they'd go on the

00:24:57.128 --> 00:24:59.455
Spree,
which was the river and get

00:24:59.455 --> 00:25:02.720
all--and drink way too much of
these spirits.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.940
So, how much did people drink?
It's scary;

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:12.888
it's just scary.
If the consumption of wine per

00:25:12.888 --> 00:25:15.966
person, per baby,
per old lady,

00:25:15.966 --> 00:25:22.225
per you, per everybody--I hope
not per you--was in 1790 was 61

00:25:22.225 --> 00:25:28.423
liters per year.
By 1850 it was 75 liters per

00:25:28.423 --> 00:25:32.912
year.
By 1895 it was 113 liters per

00:25:32.912 --> 00:25:38.556
year, but that's only wine.
Now, also remember people drank

00:25:38.556 --> 00:25:40.762
at work.
We have a former neighbor who

00:25:40.762 --> 00:25:42.890
was an alcoholic who stopped
drinking;

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.849
he's also moved away.
He was a wonderful guy.

00:25:45.849 --> 00:25:48.338
He worked at EDF,
which is a big gas factory,

00:25:48.338 --> 00:25:51.618
electrical factory in Lyon,
and he would drink six or seven

00:25:51.618 --> 00:25:54.266
liters a day,
a day, because it was so hot

00:25:54.266 --> 00:25:57.091
where he worked.
And you see the difference

00:25:57.091 --> 00:26:01.318
between American construction
industry and French construction

00:26:01.318 --> 00:26:03.680
industry.
As you know--sometimes you go,

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.434
and they're standing--they're
out directing traffic and

00:26:06.434 --> 00:26:09.392
they've got a bottle in their
hand as they're directing you

00:26:09.392 --> 00:26:11.400
along there.
It was part,

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.914
unfortunately,
of the culture of daily

00:26:14.914 --> 00:26:18.039
existence.
Now, that's just wine.

00:26:18.039 --> 00:26:19.957
Then you have to add these
other things,

00:26:19.957 --> 00:26:21.972
and the other things,
the numbers are just

00:26:21.972 --> 00:26:25.120
phenomenal.
If you add distilled liquor,

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:30.027
per capita consumption of pure
alcohol, in other words all

00:26:30.027 --> 00:26:35.153
distilled and fortified liquors,
fifty-proof and above,

00:26:35.153 --> 00:26:40.339
it was, the average was 1.2
liters a year--that's again

00:26:40.339 --> 00:26:45.622
counting every old person and
every baby--and in 1880 it

00:26:45.622 --> 00:26:53.470
doubled to 2.24,
and by 1890 it was 4.35 liters.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:56.080
So, that's plus all the wine on
the average.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:00.089
And what about beer?
Now, beer was not drunk in

00:27:00.089 --> 00:27:04.412
France until quite late.
Again, then here we go back to

00:27:04.412 --> 00:27:07.827
myth, but the myth is that it
came back with soldiers of

00:27:07.827 --> 00:27:11.180
Napoleon's armies returning from
the German states,

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.411
just as the myth that the
consumption of vodka,

00:27:13.411 --> 00:27:16.369
which is very--now there's a
big problem because they sell,

00:27:16.369 --> 00:27:19.710
these companies sell this
pernicious vodka stuff mixed

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.483
with fruit juice,
and the lycée

00:27:22.483 --> 00:27:26.547
students get wasted with it.
But the taste for--pas les

00:27:26.547 --> 00:27:30.853
miens, mais quand meme--but
the taste for vodka supposedly

00:27:30.853 --> 00:27:34.947
came to Montmartre with the
first Russian restaurant opened

00:27:34.947 --> 00:27:37.630
up by occupying soldiers in
1815.

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.459
But the big problem
among--well, among other

00:27:40.459 --> 00:27:43.684
problems--but one of the big
problems is absinthe,

00:27:43.684 --> 00:27:46.700
absinthe.
And that's worth retaining.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.940
Absinthe is made from wormwood.
It used--it was made illegal.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.668
It's physiologically addictive,
it is addictive--well,

00:27:53.668 --> 00:27:55.109
drinking's addictive,
too;

00:27:55.109 --> 00:27:58.582
but, this is physiologically
addictive, it's bad stuff,

00:27:58.582 --> 00:28:01.670
and they banned it in 1915
because of the war.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:04.907
And I had some absinthe--we
have friends in Besançon

00:28:04.907 --> 00:28:08.079
who don't drink very much,
but they had some absinthe and

00:28:08.079 --> 00:28:11.460
of course I was willing to take
a shot at that and drink that.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.214
And then it became legal again,
and now you can produce it,

00:28:15.214 --> 00:28:18.322
and you can drink it,
and it's more of a southern

00:28:18.322 --> 00:28:20.019
drink.
It's rather like--no,

00:28:20.019 --> 00:28:22.869
it's sort of like pastis,
it tastes sort of like pastis.

00:28:22.869 --> 00:28:26.352
Pastis is pastis,
it's sort of licorice tasting

00:28:26.352 --> 00:28:30.517
and you mix water with it,
hopefully lots of water and a

00:28:30.517 --> 00:28:33.397
little pastis,
and people in the south,

00:28:33.397 --> 00:28:35.801
in Corsica, and Marseille,
and Balazuc,

00:28:35.801 --> 00:28:38.242
and Ardeche,
if they're playing boule

00:28:38.242 --> 00:28:40.649
on Sunday or something like
that, and stuff that'll

00:28:40.649 --> 00:28:43.839
tourner la tête,
a couple of pastis.

00:28:43.839 --> 00:28:47.600
And it's not very good for you,
it actually damages your brain

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.682
cells in rather major ways--you
might have noticed,

00:28:50.682 --> 00:28:53.463
I don't know.
But, anyway--no,

00:28:53.463 --> 00:28:57.690
I don't drink very much pastis
at all.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:03.484
But absinthe became one of the
focuses of even some of the

00:29:03.484 --> 00:29:08.160
Impressionist paintings of
café life.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.930
I think it's Degas who
has The Absinthe

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:14.105
Drinker where you see a
woman sitting next to a man,

00:29:14.105 --> 00:29:16.529
and you don't know their
relationship.

00:29:16.529 --> 00:29:18.434
They're anonymous in the
café, you've kind of

00:29:18.434 --> 00:29:20.226
figured it out.
And in this painting,

00:29:20.226 --> 00:29:22.595
which I should have brought in
but I forgot,

00:29:22.595 --> 00:29:25.680
Degas brings you into it by not
having any table leg,

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.799
and so you wonder,
"where's the table leg?"

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:30.230
And then you reach the glass
and you see the glass.

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:31.869
And it's simply called
Absinthe.

00:29:31.869 --> 00:29:35.595
And it's always on the cover of
Emile Zola's,

00:29:35.595 --> 00:29:38.558
which I'll come to now,
Emile Zola's

00:29:38.558 --> 00:29:43.130
L'Assommoir,
inevitably in the translation.

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:45.806
Zola realized,
among others,

00:29:45.806 --> 00:29:50.960
that France seemed to be
drinking itself to death,

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.293
and this came at a time when
there was fear about the French

00:29:54.293 --> 00:29:56.440
population, which I've already
said,

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.875
that the French population is
not reproducing itself,

00:29:59.875 --> 00:30:03.405
and so they're afraid of that.
L'Assommoir,

00:30:03.405 --> 00:30:07.057
briefly, is the story about the
decline, the fall,

00:30:07.057 --> 00:30:11.380
l'assommoir--really you
can't even translate it,

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.279
it's never translated,
and l'assommoir would

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:17.758
mean- well assommé
would be just completely get

00:30:17.758 --> 00:30:20.134
wiped out,
but also if you went to a

00:30:20.134 --> 00:30:22.826
place, a bar,
every day instead of coming to

00:30:22.826 --> 00:30:26.312
class,
the place that you went that

00:30:26.312 --> 00:30:31.529
caused your ruin would be the
place of your fall,

00:30:31.529 --> 00:30:34.566
sort of, so it's got--but,
anyway, it's just translated

00:30:34.566 --> 00:30:37.603
it's the dive--that was a bad
translation once somebody

00:30:37.603 --> 00:30:40.359
did--or just the bar,
l'assommoir where things

00:30:40.359 --> 00:30:43.615
are going wrong.
And it's the story about a

00:30:43.615 --> 00:30:48.549
woman called Gervaise and her
"family," in quotes,

00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:53.286
and is part of this long series
of novels, and they all

00:30:53.286 --> 00:30:56.619
basically drink themselves to
death,

00:30:56.619 --> 00:31:00.461
and when she dies on a bed of
straw at the end of the

00:31:00.461 --> 00:31:04.303
novel--one of the amazing
scenes--and the doctors are

00:31:04.303 --> 00:31:07.997
looking at her partner who's
this completely raving

00:31:07.997 --> 00:31:10.578
alcoholic,
it touched many,

00:31:10.578 --> 00:31:13.900
many people,
and the upper classes were

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:17.963
saying well there they go again,
they're drinking because

00:31:17.963 --> 00:31:20.347
they're the drunken commoner,
while they were putting away

00:31:20.347 --> 00:31:22.818
their apéro;
an apéro,

00:31:22.818 --> 00:31:25.608
by the way, is a drink,
or two, or three that people

00:31:25.608 --> 00:31:30.273
would have before dinner.
And, so, Zola published this in

00:31:30.273 --> 00:31:31.867
1877.
And what it was,

00:31:31.867 --> 00:31:34.212
according to Barrows,
and other people,

00:31:34.212 --> 00:31:36.865
it was a call,
a cry of alarm for parliament

00:31:36.865 --> 00:31:40.665
to do something about that.
He was a man of the Left,

00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:44.315
he defended Dreyfus,
against the church and against

00:31:44.315 --> 00:31:47.089
the Army and all that,
as you know.

00:31:47.089 --> 00:31:51.569
But it was a non-political,
it was an apolitical statement.

00:31:51.569 --> 00:31:54.093
He just wants somebody to do
something about the fact that

00:31:54.093 --> 00:31:56.440
the French seem to be drinking
themselves to death,

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.053
and if you didn't believe that
all you had to do was to go up

00:31:59.053 --> 00:32:00.369
to Montmartre,
or as today,

00:32:00.369 --> 00:32:03.258
and see all the people--and a
lot of them are sort of sad

00:32:03.258 --> 00:32:05.890
sacks who've had terrible things
happen to them,

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:09.390
but the problem is just simply,
absolutely amazing.

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:11.724
Now, this book,
L'Assommoir,

00:32:11.724 --> 00:32:15.157
there was thirty-eight
printings of the book in one

00:32:15.157 --> 00:32:19.140
year, after, that year of its
publication, again 1877.

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:26.140
And by 1882 over 100,000 copies
had been sold.

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:31.633
Let me give you an example that
Barrows also found interesting,

00:32:31.633 --> 00:32:37.304
of the influence of the book,
even in the way that the first

00:32:37.304 --> 00:32:41.106
psychologists or the first
sociologists,

00:32:41.106 --> 00:32:46.369
the first anthropologists
described crowd behavior.

00:32:46.369 --> 00:32:49.816
There was a guy called Gustav
Le Bon, l-e b-o-n,

00:32:49.816 --> 00:32:52.970
who wrote a book called The
Crowd,

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:56.938
and because France was the
France of revolution and

00:32:56.938 --> 00:33:00.509
strikes, Decazville and these
other places,

00:33:00.509 --> 00:33:04.769
these other scenes that you
know about from Germinal.

00:33:04.769 --> 00:33:08.115
He was interested in the way
that crowds behaved,

00:33:08.115 --> 00:33:12.367
and he described them in ways
that reflected three of the kind

00:33:12.367 --> 00:33:16.410
of cultural/intellectual
preoccupations of the period,

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:19.410
of the Third Republic before
World War I.

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:23.771
First, he describes crowds as
flighty, that they'll go from

00:33:23.771 --> 00:33:28.132
one place to another-- think of
the women in the castration

00:33:28.132 --> 00:33:32.643
scene in Decazville--and that
was reflective of the fact that

00:33:32.643 --> 00:33:36.930
women were supposed to be
flighty and not rational,

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:40.136
and what does that fear reflect?
The fears reflect a feminism of

00:33:40.136 --> 00:33:43.612
people like Michelle Perot and
of women putting forward claims

00:33:43.612 --> 00:33:46.690
for the right to vote and for
other things as well.

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:50.606
Secondly, crowds were supposed
to be able to be manipulated by

00:33:50.606 --> 00:33:53.559
people on a big white horse,
like Boulanger;

00:33:53.559 --> 00:33:56.588
that crowds didn't have minds
of their own,

00:33:56.588 --> 00:34:00.986
but the rationality would sort
of be sucked out of them by the

00:34:00.986 --> 00:34:03.210
moment.
And what does this reflect?

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:07.160
It reflects the first interest
in hypnosis.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:12.203
Charcot, whom you've read about
in Chip Sowerwine's book,

00:34:12.203 --> 00:34:16.527
Charcot, c-h-a-r-c-o-t,
whom Freud went to visit,

00:34:16.527 --> 00:34:20.489
to pay homage to,
when he went to Paris.

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:25.684
And third, crowds were supposed
to lurch like drunks,

00:34:25.684 --> 00:34:29.679
and the image of the drunken
commoner,

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:33.021
this sort of upper class view
that the Commune was the work of

00:34:33.021 --> 00:34:36.362
the people who had nothing to
eat but found plenty to drink in

00:34:36.362 --> 00:34:39.026
Paris,
in the caves of other

00:34:39.026 --> 00:34:43.183
people's fancy apartments,
that the drunken commoner was

00:34:43.183 --> 00:34:47.340
capable of inflicting the same
kind of harm on the upper

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:52.500
classes as had been the case,
or in many cases the imagined

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:58.150
case, in previous revolutions.
And, so, the impact of drink

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:03.601
itself can be seen in the
origins of crowd psychology,

00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:08.949
of a very primitive nature,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:35:08.949 --> 00:35:10.597
And in the novel,
which you've not read,

00:35:10.597 --> 00:35:13.090
they read it in the other--the
first half of this course,

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:17.317
but he puts--focuses the novel
on a street called--which I will

00:35:17.317 --> 00:35:23.229
write on the board,
it's still there--the Rue de la

00:35:23.229 --> 00:35:31.610
Goutte d'Or, and he picks this,
the golden kind of taste,

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:35.171
he picks this because it was on
the edge of Paris,

00:35:35.171 --> 00:35:37.860
it's near the Station of the
North,

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:40.475
the Gare du Nord,
and they had produced wine

00:35:40.475 --> 00:35:43.699
there, at one time,
a "fine" wine that was--"fine,"

00:35:43.699 --> 00:35:47.940
in quotes--that was offered to
the king once a year.

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.901
But it was a street that was
very identified with very

00:35:51.901 --> 00:35:55.115
ordinary people,
with workers in the big new

00:35:55.115 --> 00:35:58.329
industries but also these old
artisans.

00:35:58.329 --> 00:36:01.364
And Gervaise starts her own
laundry, and then everything

00:36:01.364 --> 00:36:04.619
just goes wrong that could
possibly go wrong in her life,

00:36:04.619 --> 00:36:07.992
and they all get wasted
together, and basically they all

00:36:07.992 --> 00:36:09.468
die.
But this was,

00:36:09.468 --> 00:36:14.158
this image of this street,
was something that fascinated

00:36:14.158 --> 00:36:17.048
upper class readers.
And, in fact,

00:36:17.048 --> 00:36:20.977
it's only about fifteen years
ago that during one of the

00:36:20.977 --> 00:36:25.119
elections that Jacques Chirac
went to that same street,

00:36:25.119 --> 00:36:28.140
which is now identified with
immigrant populations and still

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:31.570
has this same sort of lightening
rod effect on the upper classes,

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:33.539
and said something like,
"God, it really smells here."

00:36:33.539 --> 00:36:37.694
And just, it was almost like
when Sarkozy referred to the

00:36:37.694 --> 00:36:40.959
racaille,
the people in the suburbs as

00:36:40.959 --> 00:36:44.020
scum, two years ago.
And so these are still sort

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.059
of-- these images are very,
very powerful.

00:36:46.059 --> 00:36:51.924
And Zola knew what he was
doing, and this was the effect

00:36:51.924 --> 00:36:55.790
that he wanted to make.
And what these people

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:59.050
drank--you can follow it if you
read L'Assommoir;

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.361
it's a great paper topic--they
drank almost everything they

00:37:01.361 --> 00:37:04.087
could.
But in addition to absinthe,

00:37:04.087 --> 00:37:08.300
the regional production of
fortified eau de vie,

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:13.229
both liqueurs which are sweet,
and eau de vie which is fairly

00:37:13.229 --> 00:37:17.670
sweet, which is extremely,
powerful, it's like a brandy.

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:21.768
If you look at a map of
alcoholism in France today,

00:37:21.768 --> 00:37:24.309
very--the same thing,
really,

00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:26.075
since the middle of the
nineteenth century,

00:37:26.075 --> 00:37:28.429
since you first have statistics
really from the 1870s.

00:37:28.429 --> 00:37:32.809
The big regions of alcoholism
are not in wine producing areas.

00:37:32.809 --> 00:37:35.432
Now, here again you can
say--the wine producers say

00:37:35.432 --> 00:37:37.320
"yeah, we have that healthy
drink,

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.505
baby, don't get us confused
with these heavy drinkers in

00:37:40.505 --> 00:37:43.217
those other places";
which is complete nonsense,

00:37:43.217 --> 00:37:45.789
as you know.
But, basically the big alcohol

00:37:45.789 --> 00:37:48.607
rate is there,
it's in Paris and its immediate

00:37:48.607 --> 00:37:51.474
surroundings,
it's in the north which is in

00:37:51.474 --> 00:37:55.330
the Pas-de-Calais because of all
the economic disadvantage in

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:59.187
those regions--these are not
wine producing areas at all--and

00:37:59.187 --> 00:38:03.018
in Brittany,
above all in Finistère,

00:38:03.018 --> 00:38:07.400
which is the most western
department in France.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.650
And they're not drinking wine
there.

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:12.494
What are they drinking?
They're drinking brandy,

00:38:12.494 --> 00:38:14.530
apple brandy,
in that case.

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:18.441
Calvados is the name of a
département in

00:38:18.441 --> 00:38:21.171
France, Calvados,
the capital is Caen,

00:38:21.171 --> 00:38:24.070
c-a-e-n there;
Bayeux, the Bayeux tapestry;

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:26.082
and Deauville,
a god-awful place,

00:38:26.082 --> 00:38:30.215
and all this stuff there.
But Calvados became named after

00:38:30.215 --> 00:38:34.614
that département,
and it is basically apple

00:38:34.614 --> 00:38:37.484
brandy.
There's old Calvados which is

00:38:37.484 --> 00:38:40.287
extremely good and very,
very expensive,

00:38:40.287 --> 00:38:44.239
but there's just your kind of
rot-gut Calvados also.

00:38:44.239 --> 00:38:47.456
But it's not just that,
at that particular fruit,

00:38:47.456 --> 00:38:51.610
there's almost--if you think of
Alsace there you have this pear

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.678
drink called poire,
which means pear in French,

00:38:55.678 --> 00:38:59.110
and it's eau de vie that's made
out of pear;

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:01.630
and you also have eau de vie
that's made out of raspberries.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:03.820
There's eau de vie that's made
out of strawberries,

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.880
there's eau de vie that's made
out of prunes,

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:09.014
there's eau de vie that's made
out of almost any kind of fruit

00:39:09.014 --> 00:39:11.900
you can imagine,
out of kiwi, out of anything.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:16.839
And everybody in France still
has the right to produce I guess

00:39:16.839 --> 00:39:20.563
it's about half a bathtub full a
year, of that,

00:39:20.563 --> 00:39:23.954
untaxed, at no expense.
And, of course,

00:39:23.954 --> 00:39:27.730
now in more refined times is
that true or not?

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:32.038
Who knows, but the idea--more
about this in a minute--that

00:39:32.038 --> 00:39:36.649
those kinds of alcohols are what
you would drink after dinner,

00:39:36.649 --> 00:39:39.766
as digestives.
But that's not what they were

00:39:39.766 --> 00:39:43.097
doing at the time of Zola,
and that's not what they were

00:39:43.097 --> 00:39:46.201
doing in the 1930s,
and the 1940s in Lille,

00:39:46.201 --> 00:39:50.668
and that's not what they're
doing in the 1960s and 1970s in

00:39:50.668 --> 00:39:55.318
all sorts of places.
You go to--Sunday morning,

00:39:55.318 --> 00:40:01.850
while women were in church the
men were out getting totaled,

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:06.243
knocking down this stuff.
And not all the women went to

00:40:06.243 --> 00:40:07.736
church.
But all of this,

00:40:07.736 --> 00:40:11.005
it tells you two things,
that they're drinking,

00:40:11.005 --> 00:40:14.029
well, obviously way,
way, way too much,

00:40:14.029 --> 00:40:18.739
but an unbelievable amount of
alcohol, which cuts back on life

00:40:18.739 --> 00:40:21.210
expectancy,
to be sure;

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:24.327
but, also that these,
all of these,

00:40:24.327 --> 00:40:29.737
these alcohols become part of
regional identities in France,

00:40:29.737 --> 00:40:33.679
that--Champagne is the classic
example.

00:40:33.679 --> 00:40:37.380
Champagne is still obviously
the fanciest drink.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:41.612
It's ordered for big occasions
and champagne is extremely

00:40:41.612 --> 00:40:44.085
expensive.
There are other equivalents

00:40:44.085 --> 00:40:47.679
that are less expensive that are
produced in places like Die,

00:40:47.679 --> 00:40:50.565
the Clarette de Die,
or there's--they're all over

00:40:50.565 --> 00:40:53.467
the places--produced in Alsace.
But champagne,

00:40:53.467 --> 00:40:57.136
Champagne is basically this
region here, and that becomes

00:40:57.136 --> 00:41:00.150
not only part of the identity of
Champagne,

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:03.026
which is a region,
but with French national

00:41:03.026 --> 00:41:06.506
identity.
And there's a book on how that

00:41:06.506 --> 00:41:12.051
happened, how Champagne becomes
to become seen as a drink that

00:41:12.051 --> 00:41:15.960
you really celebrate,
for big birthdays.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.838
We have a friend who just hit
eighty and we left him--before

00:41:18.838 --> 00:41:21.570
we went we left him a bottle of
really good champagne,

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:23.550
because that's something they
couldn't possibly afford;

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:28.829
and the symbolism is really
there.

00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:32.107
But Bordeaux,
Bordeaux wines profit

00:41:32.107 --> 00:41:37.119
enormously from--I think it's
1855 (or is it 1857?

00:41:37.119 --> 00:41:39.559
I don't remember),
where they classify them

00:41:39.559 --> 00:41:43.488
according to the great wines.
And of course now a bottle of

00:41:43.488 --> 00:41:48.039
Chateau Petrus or something like
that, which is the most famous

00:41:48.039 --> 00:41:50.619
Bordeaux,
along with Chateau Yquem,

00:41:50.619 --> 00:41:53.000
would go up to a thousand
dollars.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.710
It's just incredible,
those big kind of a Bordeaux.

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:01.454
We took as a present to
somebody a Bordeaux that's now

00:42:01.454 --> 00:42:04.820
$500.00 for the bottle because
we bought it about 15 years ago,

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.190
and these prices they hold
their own.

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:10.348
But for all the corruption,
for all of the trafficking too

00:42:10.348 --> 00:42:13.840
that has gone on in Bordeaux--
Burgundy, it's the same thing;

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:16.451
how closely the production of
burgundy wines like

00:42:16.451 --> 00:42:18.900
Vosne-Romanée,
and Gevrey Chamertin,

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:24.116
and really the great ones that
I could never possibly afford to

00:42:24.116 --> 00:42:26.556
taste even,
like Richebourg,

00:42:26.556 --> 00:42:31.016
how those are identified with
the region is still very

00:42:31.016 --> 00:42:33.371
important.
And another drink came along

00:42:33.371 --> 00:42:36.029
too, that's identified with the
region, that some of you may

00:42:36.029 --> 00:42:38.407
know about,
and I hope if you're under 21

00:42:38.407 --> 00:42:41.180
you've never drunk,
and that is called a kir,

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:44.423
k-i-r.
You look at the k,

00:42:44.423 --> 00:42:46.555
and you think,
"well, that's an Alsatian or

00:42:46.555 --> 00:42:49.296
Breton name," because there
aren't words in French that

00:42:49.296 --> 00:42:51.909
begin with k.
But actually Kir was,

00:42:51.909 --> 00:42:56.522
he was the mayor of Dijon,
I guess, in about the 1940s and

00:42:56.522 --> 00:42:58.809
'50s,
and he came up with the idea of

00:42:58.809 --> 00:43:01.984
putting--somebody else had had
the idea but he drank a lot of

00:43:01.984 --> 00:43:05.210
these things--of putting this
sort of black currant into white

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:07.577
wine.
And, so, then the kir becomes

00:43:07.577 --> 00:43:10.809
part of the sort of regional
identity of Burgundy.

00:43:10.809 --> 00:43:13.988
I remember, I was about your
age, seeing this great big

00:43:13.988 --> 00:43:17.579
posters saying--of some sort of
imagined Burgundian person,

00:43:17.579 --> 00:43:21.840
proud of being a Burgundian,
and he's tossing down a kir.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:26.666
But all this fits together to
create almost the impossibility

00:43:26.666 --> 00:43:31.010
of doing anything about the big
problem of drinking.

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:32.999
And when Pierre
Mendès-France,

00:43:32.999 --> 00:43:35.542
whom we'll meet later,
when he tries to run for

00:43:35.542 --> 00:43:38.858
president--he was the greatest
politician who never held--was

00:43:38.858 --> 00:43:41.289
never president of France and a
great,

00:43:41.289 --> 00:43:47.681
great man--he tried to start a
"drink milk" campaign in 1954

00:43:47.681 --> 00:43:50.849
and he was toast,
or French toast,

00:43:50.849 --> 00:43:53.693
if you will,
because they absolutely--they

00:43:53.693 --> 00:43:56.728
just destroyed him,
the wine lobby just destroyed

00:43:56.728 --> 00:44:00.086
him, they just went after him.
And you could still--I remember

00:44:00.086 --> 00:44:03.579
when these drunken guys would
park their big trucks on hills,

00:44:03.579 --> 00:44:06.326
and not put the brake on,
and they'd go--and they'd come

00:44:06.326 --> 00:44:09.422
back after about ten drinks and
these things would crash out of

00:44:09.422 --> 00:44:11.369
control and kill a bunch of
people.

00:44:11.369 --> 00:44:15.007
Again, even ten years ago they
started this campaign against

00:44:15.007 --> 00:44:18.150
drinking too much.
I must say now the last five or

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:21.971
six years they really have made
it harder because they have not

00:44:21.971 --> 00:44:25.074
gone the Swedish way,
but they have--it used to be

00:44:25.074 --> 00:44:28.264
you could have an aperitif,
you could have three glasses

00:44:28.264 --> 00:44:30.825
of--a big ballon,
a ballon is a big glass

00:44:30.825 --> 00:44:32.550
of wine, and maybe a little
calva afterward,

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:36.252
and the guy said,
"blow into this"-- what do you

00:44:36.252 --> 00:44:39.010
call those, those
ballons,

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:40.434
and he says,
"well see you,

00:44:40.434 --> 00:44:42.550
allez-y,
pas de problème."

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:44.980
And that's not the case
anymore, and that's really hurt

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.147
rural restaurants.
We had a guy in our village who

00:44:47.147 --> 00:44:49.561
had a restaurant in the summer,
and he had this little teeny

00:44:49.561 --> 00:44:51.344
waiter,
this guy who was a tiny,

00:44:51.344 --> 00:44:53.863
tiny little guy,
and at the end of his job he

00:44:53.863 --> 00:44:56.984
had one beer,
and he went out on the road and

00:44:56.984 --> 00:44:57.786
bam;
you go there,

00:44:57.786 --> 00:44:59.812
you turn the corner and there's
all these guys in big orange

00:44:59.812 --> 00:45:00.937
jackets,
and all these lights,

00:45:00.937 --> 00:45:02.718
and say, "soufflez,
monsieur," blow into the

00:45:02.718 --> 00:45:04.774
little balloon.
And he had to pay a fine he

00:45:04.774 --> 00:45:07.393
couldn't have afforded,
and he wasn't drunk at all,

00:45:07.393 --> 00:45:09.854
but he was a very,
very thin guy and it was that

00:45:09.854 --> 00:45:11.816
kind of count.
I went to a--why am I telling

00:45:11.816 --> 00:45:13.050
these stories?;
but, they're interesting.

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:16.190
I went to a place,
people we know produce pretty

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:20.599
good wine, so I went there with
this guy who's a friend of mine,

00:45:20.599 --> 00:45:25.548
and he makes me look like a
dwarf, the guy's probably about

00:45:25.548 --> 00:45:28.369
oh, 280,290 pounds,
a very big guy.

00:45:28.369 --> 00:45:31.643
And he brought his friend from
work, ironically in a halfway

00:45:31.643 --> 00:45:34.679
house for alcoholics,
and this guy made my friend

00:45:34.679 --> 00:45:38.199
look like a skatback,
look like this tiny little guy,

00:45:38.199 --> 00:45:39.990
and this guy's at least about,
I'm serious,

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:42.761
about 350 pounds.
And it was our village so I'm

00:45:42.761 --> 00:45:45.601
not driving anywhere,
I'm going to go home,

00:45:45.601 --> 00:45:52.702
go back to reading my book.
And so this guy he hits the

00:45:52.702 --> 00:45:55.481
road.
He lives about an hour and a

00:45:55.481 --> 00:45:57.898
half away.
And he got controlled twice,

00:45:57.898 --> 00:45:59.082
twice.
They said, "blow into the

00:45:59.082 --> 00:46:00.860
balloon;
no problem, see you."

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.128
That's because the guy weighs
about, literally,

00:46:03.128 --> 00:46:05.199
about 380 pounds,
and it's out of there.

00:46:05.199 --> 00:46:10.473
But, they've done a very good
thing in trying to control

00:46:10.473 --> 00:46:12.464
drink.
And the problem is that--see,

00:46:12.464 --> 00:46:14.785
it used to be when you started
out as--we're leaving the

00:46:14.785 --> 00:46:16.215
subject,
we're not leaving the

00:46:16.215 --> 00:46:18.882
subject--it used to be when,
and when our kids were growing

00:46:18.882 --> 00:46:20.630
up in France it was the same
thing,

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:22.590
even when they were two or
three years old,

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:24.269
if you know them you can ask
them,

00:46:24.269 --> 00:46:27.385
but you'd put a--you'd go to
someone's house and you'd put a

00:46:27.385 --> 00:46:29.935
little symbolic drop,
and they would never drink it

00:46:29.935 --> 00:46:31.639
but it was a sense of
participation.

00:46:31.639 --> 00:46:34.135
And then when they got to be 12
or 13 they'd put a little bit of

00:46:34.135 --> 00:46:35.997
champagne there,
if they wanted to drink it they

00:46:35.997 --> 00:46:38.219
could drink it.
But they grew up with it.

00:46:38.219 --> 00:46:42.856
And it wasn't like in high
school, when we first discovered

00:46:42.856 --> 00:46:47.653
that stuff, and then you're just
chugging it down and you see

00:46:47.653 --> 00:46:52.289
people staggering around and
vomiting their lungs out.

00:46:52.289 --> 00:46:56.080
And part of it I really truly
think is that because it was so

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.994
part of the culture,
for both good and for bad,

00:46:58.994 --> 00:47:01.633
and I emphasize the bad,
but it was a sense of

00:47:01.633 --> 00:47:04.469
participation.
And that's what came to this

00:47:04.469 --> 00:47:08.281
sort of elaboration of meals and
occasions for sociability,

00:47:08.281 --> 00:47:11.369
that's where it becomes part of
the culture.

00:47:11.369 --> 00:47:16.670
The whole idea of a meal where
you--how are we doing here?

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:21.201
we've got to roll--a meal where
we have to--where you start out

00:47:21.201 --> 00:47:23.760
with a little something to
drink,

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.067
and then you have white wine
with a fish course,

00:47:26.067 --> 00:47:28.130
or with oysters,
or something like that,

00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:30.351
and you have a certain kind of
red wine with duck,

00:47:30.351 --> 00:47:32.301
or whatever,
and then a little red wine with

00:47:32.301 --> 00:47:34.050
cheese,
but you can also have white

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:36.413
wine with goat cheese,
and maybe a little eau de vie

00:47:36.413 --> 00:47:38.980
at the end of it.
This is something that's recent.

00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:41.340
Most people could never afford
to eat like that.

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:44.139
They did choucroute,
they ate whatever they could;

00:47:44.139 --> 00:47:46.070
they couldn't afford to have
wine.

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:48.481
But this is something that
comes out of the evolution of a

00:47:48.481 --> 00:47:50.682
restaurant culture.
The first restaurants were

00:47:50.682 --> 00:47:53.761
created--a really good book by
Rebecca Spang about the origins

00:47:53.761 --> 00:47:56.840
of the restaurant--were created
in the eighteenth century,

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.963
basically;
because remember the chefs

00:47:58.963 --> 00:48:01.058
worked for the nobles,
and you'd have bouillon,

00:48:01.058 --> 00:48:03.699
which was supposed to make you
better if you were sick,

00:48:03.699 --> 00:48:05.050
so you'd go to a place to have
bouillon.

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:08.272
And then the chefs are all out
of work--this is a short version

00:48:08.272 --> 00:48:11.340
of a long subject--and they
start setting up restaurants.

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:15.952
But it's really only in the
late nineteenth century that the

00:48:15.952 --> 00:48:18.581
elaboration of meals,
and Michelin,

00:48:18.581 --> 00:48:21.398
and grading meals,
and grading what is a good

00:48:21.398 --> 00:48:24.639
restaurant--that's first 1900,
the Michelin;

00:48:24.639 --> 00:48:27.528
they're not grading yet,
they're simply saying to people

00:48:27.528 --> 00:48:29.630
on the road--and Michelin makes
tires,

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:33.197
so they're the first ones that
say you have to have signs on

00:48:33.197 --> 00:48:36.040
roads saying how far it is to
get to Vierzon,

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:39.551
or wherever.
And, so, this is part of this

00:48:39.551 --> 00:48:44.550
elaboration, that keeps food and
drink in people's assessment of

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:49.550
the French and the French of
their assessment of themselves.

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:52.390
And regional identity has,
to an extent it's

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:55.759
disappearing-- more about that
in a tirade sometime,

00:48:55.759 --> 00:48:58.599
but not now,
because we're out of time.

00:48:58.599 --> 00:49:01.489
But one can even argue that
whether Michelin with its

00:49:01.489 --> 00:49:03.600
regional guides,
and with the guides to

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.493
restaurants,
and Gault Millau,

00:49:05.493 --> 00:49:09.035
and the other guides have not
kept alive in some useful way a

00:49:09.035 --> 00:49:12.282
sense of what--that one is from
one region as opposed to

00:49:12.282 --> 00:49:14.275
another,
and where you eat certain

00:49:14.275 --> 00:49:16.920
things in one region that you
don't find specialties in

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.760
another,
and where we all started,

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.829
that you drink some kinds of
wine in some regions and not in

00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:24.219
others,
but above all that you not

00:49:24.219 --> 00:49:26.624
drink too much.
I'll pick up that theme again

00:49:26.624 --> 00:49:28.269
when we get to the Belle
Époque,

00:49:28.269 --> 00:49:30.000
because I won't be able to
resist it.

00:00:01.910 --> 00:05:38.220
Prof: &lt;&lt;Video
clip&gt;&gt;

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.149
Well I think you got the
message.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:01.302
I was actually going to show
you--this is the end of the

00:06:01.302 --> 00:06:01.819
course.
 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:04.918
Let me show you-- the beginning
of the course a little video,

00:06:04.918 --> 00:06:06.829
but it was not in the right
format.

00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:12.430
It shows our favorite dung
beetles copulating.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.639
It's very graphic and it looks
just like humans,

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.850
the same rhythm and everything,
same motions.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.242
The message of the course was,
this is what this course has

00:06:24.242 --> 00:06:27.870
been about: start with insects
doing their thing and you end up

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.661
with humans doing their thing,
and in between nothing really

00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:33.889
has changed.
 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:38.449
The desire to engage in sex has
not changed, the quest for

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:40.850
status which determines sex.
 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.190
We've had this over and over
again in the course and I hope

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.305
you realize by now that we've
discussed so much from the

00:06:49.305 --> 00:06:53.122
Princeton project and other
projects how much social

00:06:53.122 --> 00:06:56.940
acceptance is an important part
of fertility.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.095
That people determine their own
fertility a lot because of what

00:07:01.095 --> 00:07:03.910
is the acceptable norm in the
community.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.509
Aside from the direct status of
having a lot of sons,

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:11.168
a big family gives you big
status, because of protection

00:07:11.168 --> 00:07:15.658
and political power from the
large family and economic

00:07:15.658 --> 00:07:16.759
security.
 

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:19.870
But it's all tied in with
status.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.343
I think I mentioned to you
that, for instance in

00:07:23.343 --> 00:07:26.040
Bangladesh,
they looked at fertility as a

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.591
function of religiosity and one
factor that had some effect was

00:07:29.591 --> 00:07:32.170
the religiosity of the
particular family,

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.404
but the much bigger effect was
the religiosity of the

00:07:34.404 --> 00:07:34.920
community.
 

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.129
It's all community acceptance.
 

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:41.459
It's all status and we
just--that comes directly from

00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:42.959
the chimpanzees.
 

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:46.846
Of course you're aware that a
vast percentage of human

00:07:46.846 --> 00:07:50.733
consumption, and the richer you
get the greater it is,

00:07:50.733 --> 00:07:52.639
is status consumption.
 

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:57.932
The only difference between a
Mercedes and a Ford is basically

00:07:57.932 --> 00:08:00.709
status and that kind of thing.
 

00:08:00.709 --> 00:08:04.785
You've also seen that between
groups, the hostility between

00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:08.860
groups has not--basically not
changed since chimpanzees.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.757
The maltreatment of females,
the battering of females among

00:08:12.757 --> 00:08:16.117
chimpanzees, the battering of
females among humans,

00:08:16.117 --> 00:08:18.470
it's all stayed about the same.
 

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:23.841
I could have shown you that
video, you would have gotten the

00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:27.629
message that--
and also why this is a biology

00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:30.490
course,
or at least part of the reason,

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:34.392
is because the fundaments of
almost everything that we've

00:08:34.392 --> 00:08:38.851
talked about are the same set of
behavioral propensities that are

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:43.590
apparently wired into us in some
way since our chimpanzee days.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:48.860
This last--this video that you
did see,

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.202
the main point is that the
situation we are in now with

00:08:52.202 --> 00:08:56.102
respect to population is totally
unprecedented in the history of

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:59.442
humanity,
there's just never been

00:08:59.442 --> 00:09:01.379
anything like it.
 

00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:04.570
You also know something about
the future--

00:09:33.408 --> 00:09:35.884
Student:  Professor
Wyman, what year was that video

00:09:35.884 --> 00:09:36.190
made?
 

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:36.950
Prof: What?
 

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.570
Student:  What year was
that video made?

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.779
Prof: That video was
made in--

00:09:40.779 --> 00:09:44.840
I wrote that down--I think 1990
and the projections--

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:50.308
the actual numbers are pretty
good for their projection.

00:09:50.308 --> 00:09:54.429
This is not a new video and
I'll show you the projection.

00:10:27.428 --> 00:10:32.070
What's usually--these are the
projections that the UN has put

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.700
up for the future of population.
 

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:39.508
I think I showed you--early in
the course when I was discussing

00:10:39.508 --> 00:10:43.912
quantitative methods,
the US Census Bureau projection

00:10:43.912 --> 00:10:47.110
and that more or less mimics
this one.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.730
The UN shows you that there's a
range,

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.168
they do not know what's going
to happen,

00:10:53.168 --> 00:10:56.590
and so they give you a range of
possibilities for the future and

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.980
they do not call them
predictions at all,

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.600
they are simply projections.
 

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.086
Meaning that if X,
Y, Z, P or Q happens then this

00:11:04.086 --> 00:11:08.371
will be the course of population
but they don't say which of

00:11:08.371 --> 00:11:14.288
these things is going to happen,
if any of them.

00:11:14.288 --> 00:11:19.120
What would you consider in
terms of say fertility?

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.418
What would you consider the
most conservative projection?

00:11:22.418 --> 00:11:23.750
We know what's happened in the
past,

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.158
we know what the status is
today, how should we make our

00:11:27.158 --> 00:11:28.460
future projection,
 

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.590
fertility staying the same,
fertility going up,

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:36.080
fertility going down?
 

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.929
Student:  Going down.
 

00:11:37.929 --> 00:11:39.418
Prof: Thinks down, okay.
 

00:11:39.418 --> 00:11:41.330
The UN, that's one of the
projections.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.389
To my mind, the most
conservative projection is that

00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:47.990
whatever we're at today that's
where we continue to be at.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:49.687
In the sense,
that's what I think

00:11:49.687 --> 00:11:52.552
conservative means that you
preserve what's been in the

00:11:52.552 --> 00:11:53.029
past.
 

00:11:53.029 --> 00:11:58.054
Well that's this projection
that the fertility that the

00:11:58.054 --> 00:12:02.149
world is at today continues just
as it is.

00:12:02.149 --> 00:12:06.751
The projection that's carried
out to 2050, and assuming that

00:12:06.751 --> 00:12:10.575
stays where it is,
it will be--the population will

00:12:10.575 --> 00:12:11.980
be 12 billion.
 

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.928
We're now about 6.7 billion.
 

00:12:14.928 --> 00:12:20.815
The population will be not
quite double what we are now,

00:12:20.815 --> 00:12:23.490
and rising ever faster.
 

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:29.330
That's the status quo
assumption.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.912
The other assumptions are
optimistic that things

00:12:31.912 --> 00:12:34.000
will--that fertility will come
down.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.663
They're not unreasonable
assumptions and the reason why

00:12:36.663 --> 00:12:39.426
some of you chose fertility
coming down because fertility

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:40.658
has been coming down.
 

00:12:40.658 --> 00:12:46.173
It's not a crazy presumption,
but how much is going to come

00:12:46.173 --> 00:12:46.840
down?
 

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.600
The UN gives you three
possibilities.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.361
This projection,
which they call the high

00:12:54.361 --> 00:12:59.628
projection, assumes that
fertility will come down another

00:12:59.628 --> 00:13:01.509
half of a child.
 

00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:06.472
Right now this was based on the
average fertility between 2000

00:13:06.472 --> 00:13:09.672
and 2005,
it was about 2.8 children,

00:13:09.672 --> 00:13:12.619
2.85 children,
and they're presuming in this

00:13:12.619 --> 00:13:16.158
projection that it'll come down
another half a child for every--

00:13:16.158 --> 00:13:20.418
the average for everyone on
earth to 2.35,

00:13:20.418 --> 00:13:23.690
still above replacement level
fertility.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.524
With that degree of optimism,
fertility comes down another

00:13:26.524 --> 00:13:28.787
half a child,
population keeps increasing,

00:13:28.787 --> 00:13:32.195
not as fast as this,
and by 2050 we get to roughly

00:13:32.195 --> 00:13:36.940
11 billion and it's pretty much
going up in a straight line.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:41.125
Now you can get a little bit
more optimistic and say,

00:13:41.125 --> 00:13:45.152
well it's going to come down a
whole child's worth,

00:13:45.152 --> 00:13:47.889
and that's this scenario here.
 

00:13:47.889 --> 00:13:51.865
Now we're at 1.85,
the whole world has come down

00:13:51.865 --> 00:13:55.033
to a quarter--
replacement level fertility,

00:13:55.033 --> 00:13:57.955
as you know,
is 2.1 children,

00:13:57.955 --> 00:14:05.009
so 1.85 is a quarter child
below replacement fertility.

00:14:05.009 --> 00:14:08.206
You can decide for yourself how
much optimism is involved in

00:14:08.206 --> 00:14:10.048
assuming that's going to happen.
 

00:14:10.048 --> 00:14:15.014
If that's the case,
then population is like nine

00:14:15.014 --> 00:14:18.605
billion in 2050,
and continuing up,

00:14:18.605 --> 00:14:24.100
but clearly beginning to level
off at that time.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:31.009
Now they get really optimistic
and they do this line.

00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:36.105
And that's-- drops a child and
a half in this short amount of

00:14:36.105 --> 00:14:39.418
time and goes down to 1.35
children,

00:14:39.418 --> 00:14:44.052
way below replacement
fertility, and that's for the

00:14:44.052 --> 00:14:45.350
whole world.
 

00:14:45.350 --> 00:15:15.009
The assumptions are--these are
the UNs own statement of its

00:15:15.009 --> 00:15:22.168
assumptions.
 

00:15:22.168 --> 00:15:25.576
The constant fertility one,
fertility remains constant at

00:15:25.576 --> 00:15:28.070
an average of more or less 2.8
or 2.85.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.820
The high fertility assumption:
they're calling a reduction

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.320
from the fertility to 2.35
children.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.389
Medium: 1.85. 1.35.
 

00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:39.928
And then they have a really
miraculous assumption,

00:15:39.928 --> 00:15:41.610
the instant replacement
assumption,

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.570
which they don't bother to
graph, which is each country,

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.061
immediately,
like tomorrow,

00:15:46.061 --> 00:15:49.101
comes down to just the
birthrate that will replace its

00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:53.139
population,
no more and no less.

00:15:53.139 --> 00:15:57.820
What should we notice about
these things?

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.058
Obviously they're pretty
arbitrary assumptions.

00:16:01.058 --> 00:16:04.500
No one knows what's going to
happen in the future.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:08.927
No one claims to know what's
going to happen in the future

00:16:08.927 --> 00:16:13.197
and it's a sign that we
don't--we just don't know enough

00:16:13.197 --> 00:16:14.830
about this issue.
 

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:18.548
I mean I've told you a lot
of--the basic stuff that's

00:16:18.548 --> 00:16:19.120
known.
 

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.320
We do not know enough to really
predict.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.916
We asked, at the beginning of
the course, the middle and the

00:16:24.916 --> 00:16:26.984
end of the course,
why has fertility been coming

00:16:26.984 --> 00:16:27.379
down?
 

00:16:27.379 --> 00:16:28.980
What are the determinants of
fertility?

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.149
You've gotten a whole lot of
answers.

00:16:31.149 --> 00:16:35.259
If we knew the answer for sure
we would be able to predict,

00:16:35.259 --> 00:16:38.450
but the future is not terribly
predictable.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.840
These are projections not
predictions.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.480
We've got a huge range there
from about eight billion to

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.062
about 12 billion,
that's an uncertainty,

00:16:48.062 --> 00:16:51.440
and in the not terribly distant
future, of 50%.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:58.500
That's a very large degree of
uncertainty.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.524
Only the most optimistic
assumption, this last one,

00:17:02.524 --> 00:17:06.468
only the most optimistic
projection has population

00:17:06.468 --> 00:17:08.318
decreasing by 2050.
 

00:17:08.318 --> 00:17:13.425
All the other assumptions show
it continuing to increase right

00:17:13.425 --> 00:17:18.364
through 2050 with no statement
about what might or might not

00:17:18.364 --> 00:17:20.288
happen beyond that.
 

00:17:20.288 --> 00:17:23.753
In the medium variant,
this is the one that they call

00:17:23.753 --> 00:17:26.929
the medium variant,
and because they use that word,

00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:29.298
'medium' the press sort of
takes this as,

00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:31.230
well, the most likely or
something.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:35.538
The UN does not say anything
about the likelihood of any of

00:17:35.538 --> 00:17:38.509
these estimates,
but take your choice.

00:17:38.509 --> 00:17:43.465
In this rise that we're now
increasing at,

00:17:43.465 --> 00:17:49.632
from 1970-up to 2007 ,
the average rise was about 78

00:17:49.632 --> 00:17:51.930
million a year.
 

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:55.934
In this scenario by 2050
it's--the population is still

00:17:55.934 --> 00:18:00.064
increasing by 30 million a year,
so that's their medium variant

00:18:00.064 --> 00:18:02.440
as far out as they're willing to
even project,

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.464
not predict,
but even to project,

00:18:05.464 --> 00:18:10.568
population is still increasing
by 30 million a year.

00:18:10.568 --> 00:18:14.098
I keep saying these are
optimistic, remember none of

00:18:14.098 --> 00:18:17.558
these assume that fertility
starts rising again.

00:18:17.558 --> 00:18:21.130
We have indeed had a fall in
fertility.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:24.230
And there are certainly reasons
to believe that if the world--

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:28.334
we've had a fall in fertility
and we've also had really rather

00:18:28.334 --> 00:18:32.174
great progress in the world,
say since the end of World War

00:18:32.174 --> 00:18:32.410
II.
 

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:34.611
I mean people are staying
alive, they're getting more

00:18:34.611 --> 00:18:37.031
educated,
all parts of the world China,

00:18:37.031 --> 00:18:39.037
India,
Indonesia, are just

00:18:39.037 --> 00:18:42.380
unbelievably richer than they
used to be,

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.670
although still very poor and
pockets of real poverty exist.

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:50.646
I mean most of the world has
just improved tremendously,

00:18:50.646 --> 00:18:54.987
both in the rich countries in
the West, Japan and in the poor

00:18:54.987 --> 00:18:56.000
countries.
 

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.440
If you had to choose a date
that you would like to be alive,

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.358
but you couldn't choose who you
would be or where you would be,

00:19:04.358 --> 00:19:07.940
the only reasonable date to
choose is now.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:12.518
Because the average human being
on earth was worse,

00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:16.640
worse, worse going back as far
as you want.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.519
Now, if you could choose to be
a rich person,

00:19:18.519 --> 00:19:19.759
that's maybe another story.
 

00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:22.673
But if you just would be
randomly set down anywhere,

00:19:22.673 --> 00:19:24.328
you would choose to be now.
 

00:19:24.328 --> 00:19:27.661
So things have been getting
better, there's no question

00:19:27.661 --> 00:19:28.338
about it.
 

00:19:28.338 --> 00:19:33.333
If things continue to get
better--it's very reasonable to

00:19:33.333 --> 00:19:38.547
presume that one of these,
maybe not this curve but one of

00:19:38.547 --> 00:19:42.529
these more optimistic curves
might take place.

00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:46.573
There are a lot of reasons why
things may not continue to get

00:19:46.573 --> 00:19:47.180
better.
 

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:52.400
In the paper that --segments of
a paper that I wrote,

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.009
I list a number of them.
 

00:19:55.009 --> 00:19:57.660
One that I listed there was an
economic collapse,

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.814
and I was talking about the
fairly small economic collapse

00:20:01.814 --> 00:20:06.259
in Asia in 1997 which had just
happened at about that time.

00:20:06.259 --> 00:20:09.278
I did not envision,
as did no one,

00:20:09.278 --> 00:20:14.493
we have really now a global
kind of mega-crash and will we

00:20:14.493 --> 00:20:17.240
recover or not,
who knows.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.939
If economic progress is one of
the things that's required or

00:20:20.939 --> 00:20:24.261
economic increase is one of
things that's required for

00:20:24.261 --> 00:20:28.003
population to keep coming down,
then the global economy - who

00:20:28.003 --> 00:20:29.539
knows what's going to happen.
 

00:20:29.539 --> 00:20:32.578
It may very well turn around.
 

00:20:32.578 --> 00:20:37.078
Religious fundamentalism is
another thing that we know.

00:20:37.078 --> 00:20:40.019
It's not a particular religion
Christianity,

00:20:40.019 --> 00:20:44.219
or Islam, or Judaism that
matters, but it is the

00:20:44.219 --> 00:20:46.974
religiosity,
the degree to which people are

00:20:46.974 --> 00:20:49.430
religious in whatever their
religious tradition is.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:52.788
That latter makes a difference.
 

00:20:52.788 --> 00:20:57.513
Religious fundamentalism is
basically increasing all across

00:20:57.513 --> 00:21:01.750
the world, including the United
States, of course.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.807
I read an article that,
Notre Dame is one of the great

00:21:04.807 --> 00:21:07.808
Catholic Universities in America
and the priests,

00:21:07.808 --> 00:21:11.065
a number of the priests--of the
order that founded Notre Dame

00:21:11.065 --> 00:21:14.619
and still run it,
didn't want--President Obama

00:21:14.619 --> 00:21:19.913
was invited to be the speaker at
graduation this year and the

00:21:19.913 --> 00:21:25.118
priests didn't want him to be
because he's pro-abortion.

00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:31.306
The conservatism in--at one end
of the spectrum of all religions

00:21:31.306 --> 00:21:33.858
is there and increasing.
 

00:21:33.858 --> 00:21:37.290
You see the Taliban is at one
end of the Islamic spectrum,

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:41.085
they are powerful--increasingly
powerful not only in Afghanistan

00:21:41.085 --> 00:21:42.529
but now in Pakistan.
 

00:21:42.529 --> 00:21:44.279
I don't know if you've been
reading the newspapers,

00:21:44.279 --> 00:21:50.750
but they have now taken a
provincial big city or capital,

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:54.910
it was only like 13--30 miles
or something from Islamabad,

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:59.000
the capital of Pakistan so
they're increasing.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.558
The population of Orthodox Jews
in Israel,

00:22:01.558 --> 00:22:03.940
because they reproduce so much
faster than everyone else,

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:09.096
is very close to overtaking the
population of more moderate

00:22:09.096 --> 00:22:09.720
Jews.
 

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:14.143
The Palestinians and the
Orthodox Jews in Israel are

00:22:14.143 --> 00:22:19.259
having a battle to see who can
increase their fertility fast

00:22:19.259 --> 00:22:23.250
enough to sort of out-reproduce
the other.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.989
Another factor is the decline
in support for international

00:22:26.989 --> 00:22:28.170
family programs.
 

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:31.819
As you're undoubtedly aware,
the population explosion which

00:22:31.819 --> 00:22:35.220
was a very hot issue for the
press and for all kinds of

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.996
activist organizations in the
1960s and 1970s has just fallen

00:22:38.996 --> 00:22:40.130
off the map.
 

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.586
Our own school of Environmental
Studies here,

00:22:42.586 --> 00:22:43.200
Forestry.
 

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.563
does not have a single person
that pays any attention to human

00:22:46.563 --> 00:22:47.279
population.
 

00:22:47.279 --> 00:22:51.489
Courses like this are taught
basically nowhere else,

00:22:51.489 --> 00:22:53.798
very few places elsewhere.
 

00:22:53.798 --> 00:22:57.987
Environmental organizations
won't go near the population

00:22:57.987 --> 00:23:02.326
issue and so government is not
under any pressure from the

00:23:02.326 --> 00:23:06.818
citizens are reducing their
support of family planning.

00:23:06.818 --> 00:23:10.038
This has already happened in
large degree,

00:23:10.038 --> 00:23:12.950
as well as a lot of other good
programs,

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:18.583
and with the economic problems
of all governments now it's

00:23:18.583 --> 00:23:21.450
going to fall even further.
 

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.327
Student:  Don't economic
problems exacerbate social

00:23:24.327 --> 00:23:27.660
problems that governments would
want to control their fertility?

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.450
Prof: Very good
statement,

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:32.472
so do economic problems
exacerbate social problems so

00:23:32.472 --> 00:23:35.730
that people will want to more
control their fertility?

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.666
Student:  Or the
government has a much more

00:23:37.666 --> 00:23:39.210
vested interest to control
fertility.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.344
Prof: What you say is
reasonable, but the opposite of

00:23:41.344 --> 00:23:43.190
everything that we've sort of
said in the course.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:46.575
When things are getting better,
that when people come from

00:23:46.575 --> 00:23:49.093
being--
except for land availability

00:23:49.093 --> 00:23:53.058
that--when infant mortality goes
down people reduce their

00:23:53.058 --> 00:23:53.980
birthrate.
 

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.848
When education is available
people reduce their birthrate.

00:23:56.848 --> 00:23:59.960
When countries get richer
people reduce their birthrate.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:00.499
So, No.
 

00:24:00.499 --> 00:24:04.733
it's exactly the opposite
of--you should definitely take

00:24:04.733 --> 00:24:09.046
that away from this course -
that good things happen when

00:24:09.046 --> 00:24:12.048
things are already getting
better.

00:24:12.048 --> 00:24:16.558
The reduction in fertility goes
along with, I didn't say caused,

00:24:16.558 --> 00:24:20.137
but goes along with an
improvement in every kind of

00:24:20.137 --> 00:24:22.500
condition that you can count.
 

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:29.240
When the economy goes--in the
1997 Asian crisis,

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.982
a lot of women working in the
cities and were working at

00:24:31.982 --> 00:24:33.779
factories at sewing and so
forth,

00:24:33.779 --> 00:24:35.118
not having children.
 

00:24:35.118 --> 00:24:37.404
They lost their jobs,
they went back to the villages

00:24:37.404 --> 00:24:38.569
and guess what they did?
 

00:24:38.569 --> 00:24:40.858
They started having children.
 

00:24:40.858 --> 00:24:46.029
It's improvement in a situation
that gets fertility down.

00:24:46.029 --> 00:24:47.390
Student:  To go along
with that question,

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:50.605
maybe because it's more of a
short-term economic decline it's

00:24:50.605 --> 00:24:53.606
more of a shock and more of a
depression that might cause

00:24:53.606 --> 00:24:57.400
people to temporarily reduce--
Prof: Okay excellent,

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.259
her question was,
because this is a short term,

00:25:01.259 --> 00:25:04.440
more of an economic shock than
a depression,

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.140
maybe people will temporarily
reduce their fertility.

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:12.740
That's a wonderful observation.
 

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:17.358
Economists really don't know
how to answer that.

00:25:17.358 --> 00:25:19.400
When I started teaching this
course I taught--

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:24.047
co-taught it with a professor
of Economics and he was teaching

00:25:24.047 --> 00:25:26.789
sort of the economic
determinism,

00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:28.308
This is really what he believed.
 

00:25:28.308 --> 00:25:30.780
He thought that,
as countries come up

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:33.663
economically,
fertility will come down more

00:25:33.663 --> 00:25:35.450
or less automatically.
 

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.373
He was of the mind that
development is the best

00:25:38.373 --> 00:25:39.390
contraceptive.
 

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:42.025
I've shown you--since then the
data has shown,

00:25:42.025 --> 00:25:44.953
I think clearly shown,
that's not the case but that

00:25:44.953 --> 00:25:46.358
was his belief then.
 

00:25:46.358 --> 00:25:50.967
Then comes this 1997 economic
collapse in Asia and I go up to

00:25:50.967 --> 00:25:53.750
this professor,
who I was not teaching with

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.780
anymore,
and I say--I say to him 'gee

00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.369
here's this economic collapse in
Asia,

00:26:00.369 --> 00:26:04.318
what do you think will happen?'
 

00:26:04.318 --> 00:26:06.452
He said to me,
'I think fertility will go

00:26:06.452 --> 00:26:09.385
down, which is what you're
saying because conditions are

00:26:09.385 --> 00:26:11.680
getting worse,' and what you're
saying.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.749
I was shocked and I said,
'but, and I won't tell you his

00:26:14.749 --> 00:26:17.986
name, but that's exactly the
opposite of what you taught in

00:26:17.986 --> 00:26:18.880
the course.'
 

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.365
What he said to me was,
'I think the theory is flexible

00:26:22.365 --> 00:26:26.112
enough to accommodate both
results,' which means the theory

00:26:26.112 --> 00:26:27.920
didn't predict anything.
 

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.238
If you can predict this and
then the opposite it doesn't

00:26:30.238 --> 00:26:31.038
predict anything.
 

00:26:31.038 --> 00:26:32.680
So we don't know that answer to
this.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.723
I mean, first of all,
we don't know if this is a

00:26:34.723 --> 00:26:36.029
temporary economic collapse.
 

00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:40.779
I mean we hope it is,
but no guarantees.

00:26:40.779 --> 00:26:44.310
The data to figure out the
difference between what's short

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.161
term, which is undefined,
and what's long term,

00:26:47.161 --> 00:26:49.950
which is undefined,
very difficult to do;

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:51.910
you may be right you may be
wrong.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:56.440
I think we just can't be
certain about that.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:01.585
Of course, the other factor
which could cause things to go

00:27:01.585 --> 00:27:06.368
to hell in a hand basket is
environmental collapse.

00:27:06.368 --> 00:27:09.784
As the environment gets bad,
if things start getting used

00:27:09.784 --> 00:27:12.734
up,
if people really start starving

00:27:12.734 --> 00:27:15.469
or lose--
not having water or whatever

00:27:15.469 --> 00:27:19.233
the environment will do first,
and we'll talk maybe a little

00:27:19.233 --> 00:27:21.160
bit about what might happen
first.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.631
Then, again,
things could go backwards very,

00:27:24.631 --> 00:27:25.598
very fast.
 

00:27:25.598 --> 00:27:30.528
None of this is--are
predictions that I'm saying.

00:27:30.528 --> 00:27:32.940
I'm just saying that here's all
this optimism,

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.588
all of these except the
top--the constant one,

00:27:36.588 --> 00:27:39.518
all of those are optimistic
presumptions that may take

00:27:39.518 --> 00:27:39.960
place.
 

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.351
But there's just as many
reasons to think that,

00:27:42.351 --> 00:27:45.470
no, things will turn around and
fertility will go back up.

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:51.680
We just don't know the future.
 

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.951
We CAN say that,
by almost any kind of

00:27:54.951 --> 00:27:59.912
reasonable assumption,
for the next 40 years at least,

00:27:59.912 --> 00:28:06.018
we're in for a very significant
increase in population that is

00:28:06.018 --> 00:28:07.920
going to happen.
 

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.589
How does one--trying to make
this lecture at least somewhat

00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:13.108
about the environment.
 

00:28:13.108 --> 00:28:17.136
How does one relate this
population increase to

00:28:17.136 --> 00:28:22.039
environmental destruction to
decay of the environment?

00:28:22.039 --> 00:28:24.440
This is not an easy question.
 

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:29.992
There's so many variables
between human population and

00:28:29.992 --> 00:28:36.070
environmental destruction that
it's hard to pick out what's

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:39.318
just due to the population.
 

00:28:39.318 --> 00:28:43.000
The simplest statement that you
can make is that the total human

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.104
environmental footprint,
footprint is an idea come up by

00:28:47.104 --> 00:28:49.710
I guess some en-- I don't know.
 

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:52.364
Is there a name attached to who
came up with the use of the word

00:28:52.364 --> 00:28:52.868
footprint?
 

00:28:52.868 --> 00:28:56.471
Anyway, the idea of the total
environmental impact of an

00:28:56.471 --> 00:28:58.666
individual,
a city, a country,

00:28:58.666 --> 00:29:00.368
an industry,
whatever,

00:29:00.368 --> 00:29:04.348
the environmental footprint is
what's said.

00:29:04.348 --> 00:29:07.563
In the simplest way of thinking
about it, the environmental

00:29:07.563 --> 00:29:10.500
footprint is proportionate to
the number of people.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.733
Each of the people on earth
have an average footprint,

00:29:13.733 --> 00:29:16.420
the more people,
the bigger the footprint.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:20.223
And that holds at any level,
any assumptions you want to put

00:29:20.223 --> 00:29:20.740
on it.
 

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:24.152
More people,
bigger footprint,

00:29:24.152 --> 00:29:27.328
so that's fairly obvious.
 

00:29:27.328 --> 00:29:29.920
It doesn't tell you an awful
lot and so,

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.616
many years ago,
a guy named John Holdren

00:29:33.616 --> 00:29:38.737
proposed a sort of expansion of
that idea and he is now

00:29:38.737 --> 00:29:41.182
Obama's--
the Director of the Office of

00:29:41.182 --> 00:29:43.686
Science and Technology,
just recently appointed by

00:29:43.686 --> 00:29:44.640
President Obama.
 

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.268
So, at least now,
you have someone in power who

00:29:48.268 --> 00:29:50.318
thinks about population.
 

00:29:50.318 --> 00:29:55.509
What he came up with was this
equation,

00:29:55.509 --> 00:29:57.480
the impact, the environmental
impact,

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.131
he breaks it down and he says
you don't have to worry only

00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:02.548
about population but how rich is
that population,

00:30:02.548 --> 00:30:05.088
there's a difference between
rich people and poor people.

00:30:05.088 --> 00:30:09.858
What about the technology
involved?

00:30:09.858 --> 00:30:13.734
Affluence is that we clearly
know that rich people consume a

00:30:13.734 --> 00:30:17.096
lot more than poor people,
between the poorest groups on

00:30:17.096 --> 00:30:20.011
earth and the richest there's a
factor of something like 40

00:30:20.011 --> 00:30:23.027
depending on how poor you want
to go and how rich you want to

00:30:23.027 --> 00:30:23.430
go.
 

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:27.289
That number can be almost
anything, but 40 is a reasonable

00:30:27.289 --> 00:30:30.540
number to keep in mind,
so affluence is certainly

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:31.490
important.
 

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:34.118
The amount of money your
population has.

00:30:34.118 --> 00:30:38.307
And technology,
so nowadays if we want to knock

00:30:38.307 --> 00:30:42.769
down a forest we use bulldozers
and chainsaws,

00:30:42.769 --> 00:30:46.618
chainsaws that will cut down a
40 foot tree with one swipe.

00:30:46.618 --> 00:30:49.718
Clearly that technology allows
you to have a much greater

00:30:49.718 --> 00:30:52.759
impact than if you're going out
there with a little hand

00:30:52.759 --> 00:30:56.005
hatchet,
or maybe even a stone ax to try

00:30:56.005 --> 00:30:57.960
to chop down your tree.
 

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:03.028
The amount of technology that
one has clearly makes a

00:31:03.028 --> 00:31:08.778
tremendous difference on how
much destruction you can do.

00:31:08.778 --> 00:31:13.358
What you should notice is that
like all--so this is symbolized

00:31:13.358 --> 00:31:16.662
by IPAT, the impact is
population, affluence,

00:31:16.662 --> 00:31:19.588
technology all multiplied
together.

00:31:19.588 --> 00:31:22.568
You should keep in mind that
this is a tautology.

00:31:22.568 --> 00:31:24.318
Tautology means something which
is always true,

00:31:24.318 --> 00:31:27.278
the equation is always true,
and you just see that from--

00:31:27.278 --> 00:31:31.317
you define population just
people, affluence is the income

00:31:31.317 --> 00:31:33.816
per person,
the number of dollars that

00:31:33.816 --> 00:31:36.665
person has,
and technology is defined in

00:31:36.665 --> 00:31:40.108
this nice way of the impact per
dollar spent.

00:31:40.108 --> 00:31:43.529
That's the--how you're defining
these terms,

00:31:43.529 --> 00:31:47.114
how you're measuring these
terms, and you'll just notice

00:31:47.114 --> 00:31:51.348
that if you cross multiply the
persons and persons cancel out,

00:31:51.348 --> 00:31:53.338
the dollars and dollars cancel
out,

00:31:53.338 --> 00:31:57.207
so your equation ends up that
the impact is equal to the

00:31:57.207 --> 00:31:57.838
impact.
 

00:31:57.838 --> 00:32:01.938
That's the sign of a true
equation, true of hitting

00:32:01.938 --> 00:32:05.710
all--it's a tautology,
it's always the case.

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:07.801
I should show you that,
for instance,

00:32:07.801 --> 00:32:10.998
this is a standard thing out of
Science magazine,

00:32:10.998 --> 00:32:13.440
one of their stories about
population.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.801
What are they doing:
impact, here's the first thing,

00:32:16.801 --> 00:32:18.778
they list impact per dollar.
 

00:32:18.778 --> 00:32:20.724
In this case,
the impact they're interested

00:32:20.724 --> 00:32:21.420
in is carbon.
 

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:23.710
So, they're talking about the
carbon budget,

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:28.214
they even use the word budget
for that and it's for each US

00:32:28.214 --> 00:32:30.388
dollar.--
This is a global figure they're

00:32:30.388 --> 00:32:32.615
going to give,
you but they're calculating it

00:32:32.615 --> 00:32:33.390
in US dollars.
 

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:38.079
For each dollar spent on
something in the world how much

00:32:38.079 --> 00:32:39.529
carbon is used?
 

00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:44.525
So that's kilograms of carbon
per dollar and it's about now

00:32:44.525 --> 00:32:49.520
about a quarter and it's changed
somewhat over time but not

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.380
enormously,
so it's gotten better.

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:56.712
This is--the lower the number
the better that for each dollar

00:32:56.712 --> 00:33:00.903
of stuff that you buy there's
basically less carbon used to

00:33:00.903 --> 00:33:01.769
make it.
 

00:33:01.769 --> 00:33:07.817
This kind of way of thinking
about environmental impacts is

00:33:07.817 --> 00:33:14.490
now actually rather standard and
you really can't avoid this kind

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:16.160
of thinking.
 

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.221
One of the real important
things about this,

00:33:19.221 --> 00:33:22.140
that people make mistakes on
all the time,

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.490
is that the factors multiply.
 

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:28.291
That you don't add the
population plus the affluence,

00:33:28.291 --> 00:33:31.288
plus the technology,
you multiply them.

00:33:31.288 --> 00:33:34.259
One of the--there's a very
important book,

00:33:34.259 --> 00:33:36.767
I think it's called
Something New Under The

00:33:36.767 --> 00:33:39.701
Sun,
and the guy who wrote it,

00:33:39.701 --> 00:33:44.808
Yale tried to hire him as our
environmental historian.

00:33:44.808 --> 00:33:49.192
He was adding these factors and
making all kinds of totally

00:33:49.192 --> 00:33:51.546
wrong conclusions,
saying that,

00:33:51.546 --> 00:33:54.998
well the rate of growth of
affluence is so much and the

00:33:54.998 --> 00:33:57.808
rate of growth of population is
so much,

00:33:57.808 --> 00:33:59.440
so this one is more important
than that one;

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.130
just saying utter nonsense
because he didn't realize the

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:06.788
importance of the fact that--
anything per capita is

00:34:06.788 --> 00:34:10.521
multiplied by the total
population to get your global

00:34:10.521 --> 00:34:11.239
impact.
 

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:13.989
The global impact is something,
you're interested in the total

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:15.422
impact,
the total amount of carbon

00:34:15.422 --> 00:34:17.072
dioxide,
you're not interested so much

00:34:17.072 --> 00:34:19.748
in how much carbon dioxide I put
into the air but how much the

00:34:19.748 --> 00:34:22.355
six,
seven billion of us put into

00:34:22.355 --> 00:34:23.079
the air.
 

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.750
Now the equation looks simple
and it's always true,

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:35.253
and yet it's not as
straightforward as one would

00:34:35.253 --> 00:34:38.112
like,
because people take something

00:34:38.112 --> 00:34:41.230
beyond the tautological fact of
it being true.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:44.532
What this--as I've described
it, what this makes you think

00:34:44.532 --> 00:34:46.686
is,
well, an increase in population

00:34:46.686 --> 00:34:49.298
is always bad,
it always increases the impact,

00:34:49.298 --> 00:34:51.518
an increase of affluence is
always bad,

00:34:51.518 --> 00:34:54.956
it always increases the impact,
and improvement in technology

00:34:54.956 --> 00:34:57.690
is always bad,
it increases the impact.

00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:00.768
That's not true.
 

00:35:00.768 --> 00:35:03.945
As people get richer,
as affluence goes up,

00:35:03.945 --> 00:35:08.481
they tend to spend a somewhat
larger fraction of their income

00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:10.599
on environmental issues.
 

00:35:10.599 --> 00:35:13.500
That once you have a nice house
and a nice car,

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.543
and nice school,
and nice clothing you may

00:35:15.543 --> 00:35:17.389
actually want to breathe nice
air,

00:35:17.389 --> 00:35:20.710
and look at something green and
have a park to go walk into.

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:25.380
So rich people do indeed spend
more than poor people on

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:29.876
environmental issues,
so affluence can work both ways

00:35:29.876 --> 00:35:33.510
and that's very important to
remember.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:36.659
However you have to step back a
little bit and say,

00:35:36.659 --> 00:35:42.101
well in the world what fraction
of our increasing affluence have

00:35:42.101 --> 00:35:45.469
we actually spent on the
environment?

00:35:45.469 --> 00:35:48.559
We have spent a very small
fraction of it,

00:35:48.559 --> 00:35:52.054
so in fact, the overwhelming,
dominant effect of our

00:35:52.054 --> 00:35:55.891
affluence has indeed been to
have a greater impact on the

00:35:55.891 --> 00:35:59.730
environment and we've
ameliorated that a little bit.

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:02.219
I mean very noticeable,
the rivers in America,

00:36:02.219 --> 00:36:04.840
we are a rich place,
rivers are really--

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.300
a lot of rivers have been
cleaned up,

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:10.623
a lot of smog has been cleaned
up, so we have made progress in

00:36:10.623 --> 00:36:12.610
certain very visible ways.
 

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:15.824
We've exported a fair amount of
our environmental concerns to

00:36:15.824 --> 00:36:18.826
other parts of the world by
having them manufacture stuff

00:36:18.826 --> 00:36:22.061
and bringing it in here,
and knocking down their forests

00:36:22.061 --> 00:36:25.503
to bring in wood and so forth,
and the Chinese and the

00:36:25.503 --> 00:36:29.059
Japanese have done just the same
kind of thing.

00:36:29.059 --> 00:36:34.219
Similarly, with technology,
it doesn't always work one way.

00:36:34.219 --> 00:36:38.739
Yes, technology allows you to
blow off a mountain top to get

00:36:38.739 --> 00:36:39.659
some coal.
 

00:36:39.659 --> 00:36:43.297
You've seen these horrific
pictures of West Virginia and so

00:36:43.297 --> 00:36:46.494
forth where a more or less
beautiful mountain that's

00:36:46.494 --> 00:36:50.047
covered in trees is just gone,
and all that mountain top

00:36:50.047 --> 00:36:53.362
becomes slag and pollutes rivers
and acidifies rivers and does

00:36:53.362 --> 00:36:56.059
horrible things,
and you have this ugly,

00:36:56.059 --> 00:37:00.449
scarred-up land,
so technology does that.

00:37:00.449 --> 00:37:02.219
But also improvement of
technology.

00:37:02.219 --> 00:37:03.980
Begins with the mining of
copper;

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:08.768
when you replace copper wires
with fiber optics,

00:37:08.768 --> 00:37:12.168
they're made of glass and glass
is made from sand and the

00:37:12.168 --> 00:37:15.688
harvesting of sand doesn't do an
awful lot of environmental

00:37:15.688 --> 00:37:16.659
destruction.
 

00:37:16.659 --> 00:37:23.228
So, that's an improvement in
the environment and there's a

00:37:23.228 --> 00:37:26.570
number of examples of that.
 

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:30.833
Again you have to ask--cars
are--our current push now to

00:37:30.833 --> 00:37:33.159
make cars that use less gas.
 

00:37:33.159 --> 00:37:37.822
So the good that it does use,
it gets you how many--to drive

00:37:37.822 --> 00:37:41.300
a mile you use less gas,
not enormously less,

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.039
but somewhat less.
 

00:37:43.039 --> 00:37:46.565
Technology can help you,
and again the standard question

00:37:46.565 --> 00:37:48.429
is,
has our improvement in

00:37:48.429 --> 00:37:51.356
technology over the last 20,
30,40, 50 years,

00:37:51.356 --> 00:37:53.909
whatever time window you want
to deal with,

00:37:53.909 --> 00:37:57.840
has this allowed us to do more
environmental destruction of the

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.768
earth or have we used enough--
a big enough fraction of it to

00:38:01.768 --> 00:38:03.349
improve the environment.
 

00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:08.045
Our efficiency of use of the
environment, that the things

00:38:08.045 --> 00:38:12.739
have gotten better and the
answer is: there's no question

00:38:12.739 --> 00:38:14.920
about what's happened.
 

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.625
You see in this,
again this is more

00:38:16.625 --> 00:38:20.014
CO_2 stuff,
that here is the sources of

00:38:20.014 --> 00:38:23.170
CO_2 addition into the
air,

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:26.853
which is a very good index of
what's happening in the total

00:38:26.853 --> 00:38:27.489
economy.
 

00:38:27.489 --> 00:38:33.918
What you see is the land use,
so land adds into the

00:38:33.918 --> 00:38:41.117
CO_2 by--where
deforestation and using wood for

00:38:41.117 --> 00:38:44.460
timber and everything.
 

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:48.291
The amount--the land use,
the changes in land use has not

00:38:48.291 --> 00:38:49.730
enormously changed.
 

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:53.730
The width of that line is more
or less the same over time,

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:57.480
so the change in land use is
putting about the same amount of

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.480
carbon into the air as before.
 

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:02.905
There's a little bit of other
emissions which we don't have to

00:39:02.905 --> 00:39:06.052
worry about, but fossil fuel
combustion has just gone up,

00:39:06.052 --> 00:39:07.119
up, up, and up.
 

00:39:07.119 --> 00:39:10.159
Whatever the balance of our
affluence and our technology,

00:39:10.159 --> 00:39:13.994
whatever the balance,
well we can see that is the

00:39:13.994 --> 00:39:19.108
balance of our use between using
it to ameliorate the environment

00:39:19.108 --> 00:39:23.262
versus messing up the
environment and we'll come back

00:39:23.262 --> 00:39:26.460
to this slide if we have a
chance.

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:38.164
The--in terms of the
efficiency, that first factor,

00:39:38.164 --> 00:39:43.181
not the first factor,
the dollars per carbon use that

00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:44.340
is here.
 

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:49.000
Actually the carbon use per
dollar is quite interesting;

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.869
it has been coming down.
 

00:39:50.869 --> 00:39:55.324
From 1970 it was about a third
of a kilogram of carbon per

00:39:55.324 --> 00:40:00.090
dollar and that's come down to
now something like a quarter of

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:03.869
a kilogram per dollar spent,
and that's just carbon,

00:40:03.869 --> 00:40:07.001
so you multiply that by almost
four if you want to measure in

00:40:07.001 --> 00:40:09.976
CO_2 because carbon is
about one quarter of each

00:40:09.976 --> 00:40:11.489
CO_2 molecule.
 

00:40:11.489 --> 00:40:18.534
It's basically--we know for
each dollar spent we put out two

00:40:18.534 --> 00:40:20.844
pounds,
a kilogram of carbon,

00:40:20.844 --> 00:40:23.871
so every time you go and buy
something just give them a $1

00:40:23.871 --> 00:40:26.900
and say that's two pounds of
carbon I'm putting into--

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:29.400
of carbon dioxide I'm putting
into the atmosphere.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:34.900
It's a not crazy way of
thinking about things.

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:37.990
What is worrying people now is
that this has been a pretty good

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:39.998
decline,
but actually this is now

00:40:39.998 --> 00:40:43.400
turning out to be more
significant than people thought.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:47.831
The rate of decline here,
that's decline in efficiency of

00:40:47.831 --> 00:40:50.920
use of carbon,
was about 1.3% a year.

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:54.699
It's no longer declining and
this seems to have continued.

00:40:54.699 --> 00:41:00.059
It's now going up by 0.3%,
3/10ths of a percent a year,

00:41:00.059 --> 00:41:03.960
so it looks like the--that
we've picked the easy apples,

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:08.541
the low hanging fruit as they
say, in improving our carbon

00:41:08.541 --> 00:41:12.639
efficiency and now we may be
getting worse again.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:22.860
All of that is about how to
think--

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:27.380
now one of the ways of putting
in a quantitative view of the

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:32.210
relationship between population
and the environmental impact.

00:41:36.909 --> 00:41:39.092
There are many,
many other considerations with

00:41:39.092 --> 00:41:41.469
the relationship between
population and impact.

00:41:41.469 --> 00:41:47.085
One is the expansion of humans
into almost every habitat on

00:41:47.085 --> 00:41:47.860
earth.
 

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:53.105
There's almost no limit to this
so I'll show you some

00:41:53.105 --> 00:41:57.039
limiting--some extreme cases of
this.

00:41:57.039 --> 00:41:58.360
What's going on?
 

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.449
It's something that Malthus
talked about.

00:42:00.449 --> 00:42:03.918
Remember we described what
Malthus said,

00:42:03.918 --> 00:42:08.900
he's living in England just
about 1800 and the population

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:10.590
was increasing.
 

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:12.679
What did they do?
 

00:42:12.679 --> 00:42:14.896
There was farmland,
the best farmland was already

00:42:14.896 --> 00:42:17.702
farmed,
but as there were more farmers,

00:42:17.702 --> 00:42:21.480
the farmers had to move onto
more marginal land,

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.789
less good land.
 

00:42:23.789 --> 00:42:27.592
What he was thinking was that
if there's a law of diminishing

00:42:27.592 --> 00:42:30.199
returns,
that you have farmers on good

00:42:30.199 --> 00:42:32.000
land,
they're producing so much per

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.340
farmer and it's fairly good.
 

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:36.059
England was not a very poor
place.

00:42:36.059 --> 00:42:39.469
As population increases they
have to move onto drier land,

00:42:39.469 --> 00:42:42.318
swampier land,
hillier land,

00:42:42.318 --> 00:42:46.967
and the production per farmer,
for these new farmers,

00:42:46.967 --> 00:42:49.250
is less than those that had the
best land.

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:52.931
While the total production
grows, and remember Malthus

00:42:52.931 --> 00:42:55.989
showed a linear rise in total
production,

00:42:55.989 --> 00:43:00.101
that with new people total
production grows but population

00:43:00.101 --> 00:43:01.760
is growing like this.
 

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:05.786
Since each new person produces
less than an old person,

00:43:05.786 --> 00:43:09.740
he has to farm on worse land
than the earlier farmers,

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.650
the average productivity goes
down.

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:15.699
That is a thing that has
happened all through history.

00:43:15.699 --> 00:43:18.969
Of course humans when they have
a choice of land,

00:43:18.969 --> 00:43:22.507
when they're not crowded,
when nobody else is standing

00:43:22.507 --> 00:43:24.909
around they choose the best
land,

00:43:24.909 --> 00:43:30.630
the easiest to get along with,
to survive in.

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:38.500
Then what happens is people
move out into less good land.

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:43.612
The pictures I'm going to show
you are from Niger which is in

00:43:43.612 --> 00:43:45.822
Sahel,
just south of the Sahara

00:43:45.822 --> 00:43:49.130
Desert, it actually sticks up
into the Sahara Desert,

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:55.650
and this is a province of Niger
called Azawakh.

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:58.443
It's a huge province because
there's not many people there,

00:43:58.443 --> 00:44:00.900
it's a big thing right on the
edge of the Sahara.

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:04.429
The population is 50,000 people.
 

00:44:04.429 --> 00:44:10.389
In the dry season they have two
wells in the whole--

00:44:10.389 --> 00:44:12.690
for that whole huge territory,
for that whole--

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:16.295
for all those 50,000 people
there are only two wells and

00:44:16.295 --> 00:44:18.590
only one of them works
regularly.

00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:22.320
During the rainy season and
this is what it looks like in

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.320
that country.
 

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:27.360
They have, you can see,
there's no water,

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:30.577
nothing growing in the ground,
some of the trees that can

00:44:30.577 --> 00:44:32.793
survive,
grass doesn't survive this,

00:44:32.793 --> 00:44:35.489
it's too small and it loses
water, it's gone.

00:44:35.489 --> 00:44:40.809
Trees can store water basically
and survive fairly long periods

00:44:40.809 --> 00:44:45.699
of drought, so you get some
what's called scrub forest.

00:44:45.699 --> 00:44:48.489
In the wet season they're very
joyous,

00:44:48.489 --> 00:44:53.469
they have lots of water,
they drink lots of water,

00:44:53.469 --> 00:44:57.456
but this is the amount of water
that they have and the people

00:44:57.456 --> 00:44:59.650
use it for all their functions.
 

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:01.418
The animals,
I don't know if you can see an

00:45:01.418 --> 00:45:05.155
animal back here,
the animals use it to drink and

00:45:05.155 --> 00:45:10.670
relieve themselves and here's
girls washing in this water.

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:14.489
This is in the good time of the
year;

00:45:14.489 --> 00:45:19.110
this is the water that they
have to survive on.

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:21.550
The dry season is nine months
long.

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:25.663
You have some rain,
not a lot, but some rain for

00:45:25.663 --> 00:45:29.163
three months,
then the dry season is nine

00:45:29.163 --> 00:45:34.590
months long, and then this is
the labor value of children.

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:38.876
These young girls must travel
35 miles to one of the two wells

00:45:38.876 --> 00:45:42.039
that are available and that's
the average,

00:45:42.039 --> 00:45:44.900
depending on where they live,
that they have to walk--

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:48.969
no mechanized transport,
they walk 35 miles and they can

00:45:48.969 --> 00:45:53.335
carry back only enough water so
their families can drink one

00:45:53.335 --> 00:45:54.518
glass a day.
 

00:45:54.518 --> 00:45:57.643
Remember we used to be told,
it's now shown not to be not

00:45:57.643 --> 00:46:00.208
really scientific,
drink eight glasses of water

00:46:00.208 --> 00:46:04.925
every day;
they're living on one-eighth of

00:46:04.925 --> 00:46:07.719
that amount of water.
 

00:46:07.719 --> 00:46:10.882
You have to ask yourselves,
why do people live in such a

00:46:10.882 --> 00:46:12.090
God forsaken place?
 

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:16.697
This life is so hard and so
miserable, and what is the

00:46:16.697 --> 00:46:17.480
answer?
 

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:20.809
The better places have somebody
on them already.

00:46:20.809 --> 00:46:25.259
The story, if you can do the
sort of anthropological history,

00:46:25.259 --> 00:46:29.782
is virtually always that this
tribe at one point lived in some

00:46:29.782 --> 00:46:31.340
much nicer place.
 

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.626
Some tribe got more populous,
got stronger in one way or

00:46:34.626 --> 00:46:38.331
another was more vicious,
and they got pushed out of what

00:46:38.331 --> 00:46:43.360
was their original,
aboriginal fairly decent land

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:46.510
onto more marginal land.
 

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:50.954
While they may have been living
now for hundreds of years,

00:46:50.954 --> 00:46:55.164
in a sense, it's not their own
choice to live on such a

00:46:55.164 --> 00:46:57.659
miserable part of the world.
 

00:46:57.659 --> 00:47:01.143
When you read I think in
the--The War Before

00:47:01.143 --> 00:47:03.976
Civilization,
I gave you some readings in

00:47:03.976 --> 00:47:06.219
this book which calculated all
the violence,

00:47:06.219 --> 00:47:10.637
it describes some people that
had been pushed out into these

00:47:10.637 --> 00:47:13.409
marginal lands by stronger
people,

00:47:13.409 --> 00:47:15.900
so it gives you a number of
examples of that.

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:20.045
Of course the big example,
the big modern example is in

00:47:20.045 --> 00:47:22.853
America,
that the European settlers

00:47:22.853 --> 00:47:27.260
pushed the American Indians,
the Native Americans into

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:28.630
horrible lands.
 

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:32.132
The stories of pushing the
Cherokees from nice farmland and

00:47:32.132 --> 00:47:35.635
nice productive land in say
North Carolina and putting them

00:47:35.635 --> 00:47:37.929
into Oklahoma which was half
dry,

00:47:37.929 --> 00:47:42.976
or the Apaches and various
Indians pushed them off into the

00:47:42.976 --> 00:47:43.760
desert.
 

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:46.947
You go see how miserably a lot
of the American Indians now live

00:47:46.947 --> 00:47:49.159
in the Navajo reservations and
so forth,

00:47:49.159 --> 00:47:51.880
and say, my God,
why do they want to live there?

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.329
They don't.
 

00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:58.996
They didn't want to live there,
they weren't given a choice,

00:47:58.996 --> 00:48:01.590
and they were pushed out.
 

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:05.161
We're talking about dryness
which is one of the things that

00:48:05.161 --> 00:48:08.733
people just absolutely can't
exist without water so this is

00:48:08.733 --> 00:48:10.889
really the border of existence.
 

00:48:10.889 --> 00:48:14.416
But, where it's very wet--you
remember you read in Bangladesh

00:48:14.416 --> 00:48:17.766
that people living on the mud
flats and the monsoon season

00:48:17.766 --> 00:48:20.036
comes in,
the water rises or a flood

00:48:20.036 --> 00:48:22.039
comes, and they're just washed
out.

00:48:22.039 --> 00:48:26.143
Those people didn't choose to
live there, there's no land

00:48:26.143 --> 00:48:29.222
anywhere else,
and so they do whatever they

00:48:29.222 --> 00:48:29.809
can.
 

00:48:29.809 --> 00:48:32.590
The Eskimos that live up on the
polar ice cap,

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:34.880
there are some Eskimos that are
constantly--

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:42.231
apparently constantly on the
ice cap and don't have a base on

00:48:42.231 --> 00:48:43.090
land.
 

00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:47.067
When we think of people living
in these very marginal

00:48:47.067 --> 00:48:50.202
circumstances,
one attributes them then to

00:48:50.202 --> 00:48:52.860
these famines;
people who live in this region

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:54.099
have famines every so often.
 

00:48:54.099 --> 00:48:56.331
There's great drought,
as you know,

00:48:56.331 --> 00:48:57.119
right now.
 

00:48:57.119 --> 00:48:59.739
Parts of Africa have terrible
drought.

00:48:59.739 --> 00:49:03.905
California has a terrible
drought, the Colorado River

00:49:03.905 --> 00:49:05.989
Basin is having drought.
 

00:49:05.989 --> 00:49:10.179
So, when this happens,
it's always when--

00:49:10.179 --> 00:49:13.137
the people get into great
trouble and they can easily

00:49:13.137 --> 00:49:16.039
starve to death and some
advanced countries may,

00:49:16.039 --> 00:49:18.831
or may not, send them food,
and sending them food has its

00:49:18.831 --> 00:49:19.579
own problems.
 

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:26.443
It's always attributed to
environmental variability,

00:49:26.443 --> 00:49:28.110
to climatic troubles.
 

00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:31.949
No one ever asks the question,
why have these people been

00:49:31.949 --> 00:49:35.380
pushed into this incredibly
inhospitable region?

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:38.599
I mean part of the ecology of
that region is you're going to

00:49:38.599 --> 00:49:42.038
have droughts every so often and
sometimes they're going to last

00:49:42.038 --> 00:49:43.840
for years and be very severe.
 

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.289
In California,
the drought in California has

00:49:46.289 --> 00:49:47.599
now lasted for years.
 

00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:57.606
Everything in the environment,
the relationship between the

00:49:57.606 --> 00:49:59.010
population and environments is
circular.

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:03.753
That people affect the
environment and the environment

00:50:03.753 --> 00:50:08.320
comes and bites them back,
it comes back to them.

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:13.327
Water is one of the key things
and probably what will give out

00:50:13.327 --> 00:50:17.760
first when we really reach the
environmental limit,

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:21.139
it will almost certainly be
fresh water.

00:50:21.139 --> 00:50:24.822
There is a lot of information
that you can get on this very

00:50:24.822 --> 00:50:26.920
easily, it's not secret at all.
 

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:30.947
There are two sources of water
that humans can use,

00:50:30.947 --> 00:50:32.800
which is fresh water.
 

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:36.764
You can desalinate salt water
but the energy costs are

00:50:36.764 --> 00:50:40.054
enormous so it's not--
unless you're an Arab and

00:50:40.054 --> 00:50:43.103
sitting on an oil well you
really can't do it in any

00:50:43.103 --> 00:50:44.179
reasonable way.
 

00:50:44.179 --> 00:50:47.800
There's renewable water,
which is rain water.

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:49.349
When it rains,
that is renewable.

00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:52.219
There's this cycle of it goes
up into the atmosphere and comes

00:50:52.219 --> 00:50:53.159
back down as rain.
 

00:50:53.159 --> 00:50:56.775
So you have renewable water
coming eventually into rivers

00:50:56.775 --> 00:50:59.809
and in one way or another you
tap the rivers.

00:50:59.809 --> 00:51:03.331
Then there's mined water,
when you mine it just like you

00:51:03.331 --> 00:51:06.659
mine coal, you dig down and you
suck up the water.

00:51:09.719 --> 00:51:14.322
The greatest productivity of a
lot of the farm regions of the

00:51:14.322 --> 00:51:16.699
world comes from mined water.
 

00:51:16.699 --> 00:51:21.458
So--the Midwest of the U.S.,
especially as you get further

00:51:21.458 --> 00:51:26.385
west in it, does not have enough
rainfall, so they use mined

00:51:26.385 --> 00:51:27.219
water.
 

00:51:27.219 --> 00:51:30.764
You probably have heard that
the reason they can use mined

00:51:30.764 --> 00:51:34.434
water is that underlying on our
Midwest is what's called the

00:51:34.434 --> 00:51:35.739
Ogallala aquifer.
 

00:51:35.739 --> 00:51:39.016
Ogallala is the name of one of
the Indian groups that used to

00:51:39.016 --> 00:51:40.929
live there, the Ogallala
aquifer.

00:51:40.929 --> 00:51:47.184
The farmers all over the west
there just sink down a tube and

00:51:47.184 --> 00:51:49.268
suck up the water.
 

00:51:49.268 --> 00:51:54.135
Well you have to think
of--being a scientist you always

00:51:54.135 --> 00:51:58.291
want to know how why,
where, all this kind of stuff,

00:51:58.291 --> 00:52:01.480
and since a kid you read about
Artesian wells,

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.250
and wells to underground water.
 

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:06.498
Then, eventually,
you ask yourself,

00:52:06.498 --> 00:52:09.460
how does water get into rock?
 

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:12.829
The reason is it drips in there.
 

00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:17.038
The Ogallala aquifer actually
filled from the melt-off of the

00:52:17.038 --> 00:52:18.090
last ice age.
 

00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:21.545
Apparently the peak of the last
ice age was about 18,000 years

00:52:21.545 --> 00:52:25.000
ago and then it took about 8,000
years to melt until something

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.155
like 10,000 years ago,
those are very approximate

00:52:28.155 --> 00:52:28.719
numbers.
 

00:52:28.719 --> 00:52:32.735
For 8,000 years ice was
melting, the ground was soggy,

00:52:32.735 --> 00:52:34.480
and drip, drip,
drip.

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:37.818
Rock is never totally solid,
there's always somewhere,

00:52:37.818 --> 00:52:41.722
some little crack and the water
slowly drips through the cracks

00:52:41.722 --> 00:52:42.920
and goes in it.
 

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:48.110
Any kind of--When the rocks get
folded, there's caverns in there

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:53.219
and any kind of space eventually
water will find its way in.

00:52:53.219 --> 00:52:56.320
If you ever paid attention to
the roof on your house,

00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.480
you know that water gets in,
no matter what you do.

00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:04.030
It's the filling of these
aquifers.

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:06.610
I don't know--I can't remember
when that ice age started,

00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:09.268
but something that took 8,000
years to fill,

00:53:09.268 --> 00:53:12.217
but that depended on a glacier
which was there for the previous

00:53:12.217 --> 00:53:12.929
10,000 years.
 

00:53:12.929 --> 00:53:16.891
So, we're talking about a
resource that is one of the

00:53:16.891 --> 00:53:21.233
shorter term resources and it's
something like it fills in

00:53:21.233 --> 00:53:22.530
20,000 years.
 

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:30.650
Now we're sucking it up in
decades and it's very much going

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:32.190
way down.
 

00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:34.061
There were some slides,
and the reason I was a little

00:53:34.061 --> 00:53:35.449
late,
I could not find the slides

00:53:35.449 --> 00:53:37.213
this morning,
I had them yesterday and I

00:53:37.213 --> 00:53:40.822
don't know where they went,
so I didn't put them on but

00:53:40.822 --> 00:53:44.780
they showed some interesting
kinds of things.

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:48.346
That when you're sitting on top
of this aquifer you've got the

00:53:48.346 --> 00:53:51.152
rock and the water,
water is incompressible so it

00:53:51.152 --> 00:53:52.440
holds up the rock.
 

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:55.090
You suck out the water there's
now a space there,

00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:57.630
and what happens,
the rock starts crumbling and

00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:58.570
falling down.
 

00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:02.059
What happens is the land
actually falls.

00:54:02.059 --> 00:54:05.139
In the pictures that I could
not find,

00:54:05.139 --> 00:54:10.230
show first from Houston,
Texas a farm there and it's--

00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:12.967
shows you a pump,
it's just a concrete platform

00:54:12.967 --> 00:54:16.327
with a pump,
and you know where the land was

00:54:16.327 --> 00:54:20.150
and then the land is several
feet beneath that.

00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:23.949
The land is just shrunken,
has collapsed.

00:54:23.949 --> 00:54:27.059
And the second picture I want
to show is in Galveston,

00:54:27.059 --> 00:54:31.320
Texas not so far from Houston,
now the land has fallen,

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:35.032
again all due to irrigation,
but they're near the sea so the

00:54:35.032 --> 00:54:38.179
salt water has come in and now
what used to be good

00:54:38.179 --> 00:54:42.019
agricultural land is now flooded
with the Gulf of Mexico.

00:54:42.019 --> 00:54:44.389
Are you from that region?
 

00:54:44.389 --> 00:54:47.139
She was shaking her head,
as maybe she knows.

00:54:47.139 --> 00:54:53.137
The most impressive picture
comes from the San Joaquin

00:54:53.137 --> 00:54:55.739
Valley of California.
 

00:54:55.739 --> 00:54:58.342
Now, you know probably--That's
where all our fruits and

00:54:58.342 --> 00:55:00.463
vegetables come from,
that's a huge source of

00:55:00.463 --> 00:55:01.670
American food supply.
 

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:04.490
Probably almost all of you
today have already today eaten

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:06.860
something that was farmed in the
San Joaquin.

00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:09.880
Anybody from that part?
 

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:13.929
Nobody from--we don't have
enough farmers at Yale.

00:55:13.929 --> 00:55:17.713
Well this is a picture of a
pole that they put in to measure

00:55:17.713 --> 00:55:19.190
the drop of the land.
 

00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:22.099
What you see is this very large
pole and a man,

00:55:22.099 --> 00:55:24.059
the man is sort of down here.
 

00:55:24.059 --> 00:55:28.070
What the pole is,
is the top of the pole is where

00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:32.030
the land was in--
I can't remember like 1957 or

00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:37.264
something like that and the land
has dropped 30 feet in that time

00:55:37.264 --> 00:55:41.679
and the man is now 5.5 foot man
or a six foot man,

00:55:41.679 --> 00:55:44.750
is a small fraction of this
pole.

00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:47.590
It's really a shocking kind of
photo, and of course the

00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:50.643
agricultural activity in the
valleys of California has only

00:55:50.643 --> 00:55:51.960
increased since then.
 

00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:57.829
The amount of water pumped has
increased and the land keeps

00:55:57.829 --> 00:56:03.496
falling at a very noticeable
rate, so it's a very graphic

00:56:03.496 --> 00:56:04.510
thing.
 

00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:07.829
Now, from when you suck out the
water,

00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:11.737
it takes quite a while for the
rock to sort of collapse and

00:56:11.737 --> 00:56:15.780
fall down because it's got some
structural strength to it.

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:18.929
If you can see how the much the
land has fallen,

00:56:18.929 --> 00:56:22.382
you can just imagine how much
the water table itself has

00:56:22.382 --> 00:56:25.405
fallen,
many times more than the actual

00:56:25.405 --> 00:56:26.719
land has fallen.
 

00:56:26.719 --> 00:56:30.570
In some places you can measure
this fairly readily.

00:56:30.570 --> 00:56:34.648
In parts of Texas and Arizona
water tables have dropped

00:56:34.648 --> 00:56:39.057
hundreds of feet,
even in northwest of Chicago

00:56:39.057 --> 00:56:44.960
there's been a 200 to 300 foot
drop in the water table,

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.289
just sucking it out.
 

00:56:46.289 --> 00:56:49.965
Three quarters of Texas'
irrigated area water tables are

00:56:49.965 --> 00:56:53.039
falling and this is true all
over the world.

00:56:53.039 --> 00:56:55.764
I mean the United States is
very technological so we do a

00:56:55.764 --> 00:56:58.650
lot of drilling,
but the north China plain,

00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:01.737
which is,
again, where the wheat in China

00:57:01.737 --> 00:57:06.000
is grown,
drops 40 inches every year.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.976
Tamil Nadu in India,
southern India,

00:57:08.976 --> 00:57:14.333
another very productive part of
the world, 100 inches a year the

00:57:14.333 --> 00:57:16.800
water tables are falling.
 

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:21.273
There's a study that just came
out--in February,

00:57:21.273 --> 00:57:26.983
which measures the groundwater
levels that are coming--of the

00:57:26.983 --> 00:57:30.599
water coming out of the
Himalayas.

00:57:30.599 --> 00:57:32.994
So, the Himalayas,
as you know,

00:57:32.994 --> 00:57:37.704
sit right in the center of Asia
and the Yellow River and the

00:57:37.704 --> 00:57:40.739
Yangtze River sort of feed
China,

00:57:40.739 --> 00:57:45.268
and you have the Helmand River
feeds Afghanistan,

00:57:45.268 --> 00:57:50.197
the Indus River feeds Pakistan
and the Ganges River feeds north

00:57:50.197 --> 00:57:54.650
India and you've got the Ganges
goes into Bangladesh,

00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:57.809
the Brahmaputra,
the Meghna all feed the

00:57:57.809 --> 00:58:00.744
Bangladesh area,
then you have the Mekong,

00:58:00.744 --> 00:58:03.545
and the Salween,
and the Irrawaddy,

00:58:03.545 --> 00:58:08.123
which do Vietnam and Thailand,
and Cambodia,

00:58:08.123 --> 00:58:14.829
and Burma, so all of these come
out of the Himalaya mountains.

00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:15.949
What's happening?
 

00:58:15.949 --> 00:58:21.804
The groundwater in these
regions is going down 2 to 4

00:58:21.804 --> 00:58:28.447
meters a year so that's 6 to
12,13 feet every year the water

00:58:28.447 --> 00:58:30.699
table goes down.
 

00:58:30.699 --> 00:58:34.179
Venice is sinking for similar
reasons;

00:58:34.179 --> 00:58:36.510
it's much smaller,
only 9 inches in the whole

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:37.039
century.
 

00:58:37.039 --> 00:58:40.190
Bangkok is sinking 13
centimeters a year.

00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:44.179
Mexico City--I hope I have
those slides here.

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:54.273
Mexico City is sinking in a
drastic way there's very--since

00:58:54.273 --> 00:58:58.820
it's so prominent there's very
good data from Mexico City.

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:02.320
Mexico City put in a subway,
a wonderful subway,

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:06.639
if--I had a young lady with me
when I was in the subway;

00:59:06.639 --> 00:59:10.795
aside from getting squeezed you
get groped in the Mexico City

00:59:10.795 --> 00:59:11.420
subway.
 

00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:15.750
They laid it flat,
but now with the ground--

00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:18.556
the sucking out of the water
the ground is sinking and it

00:59:18.556 --> 00:59:22.356
doesn't sink evenly,
so now the subway is like this

00:59:22.356 --> 00:59:27.123
and some of it that was
underground is now above ground

00:59:27.123 --> 00:59:32.329
because the ground has just
sunken away from the subway.

00:59:32.329 --> 00:59:38.380
The sewers and the water supply
have exactly the same problem.

00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:43.356
Water--in Mexico City,
the city itself has sunk 30

00:59:43.356 --> 00:59:48.639
feet from when the subway was
originally put down.

00:59:48.639 --> 00:59:54.219
Water pipe that was laying flat
on the ground in 1934 is now 26

00:59:54.219 --> 00:59:59.530
feet over everyone's head and
some suburbs are sinking about

00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:01.690
two feet every year.
 

01:00:01.690 --> 01:00:07.681
Student:  How come all
this stuff doesn't also just

01:00:07.681 --> 01:00:09.679
sink down evenly?
 

01:00:09.679 --> 01:00:11.800
Prof: Because it's
all--it's uneven and I don't

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.119
really know the answer to that.
 

01:00:13.119 --> 01:00:15.277
The question is why doesn't
everything sort of just sink

01:00:15.277 --> 01:00:15.630
evenly?
 

01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:18.775
It just doesn't happen,
so a flat subway ends up like

01:00:18.775 --> 01:00:19.199
this.
 

01:00:19.199 --> 01:00:20.597
Student:  Like the pole
in California,

01:00:20.597 --> 01:00:21.900
why doesn't it just sink to the
ground?

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:24.570
What is it attached too?
 

01:00:24.570 --> 01:00:26.889
Prof: I don't know how
they arranged that pole,

01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:29.429
you would think everything
would sink, yes I don't know.

01:00:29.429 --> 01:00:34.429
They may--I don't know,
just don't know the answer.

01:00:34.429 --> 01:00:38.440
In Mexico City the water
supply, as more water is pumped,

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.099
of course the city--the rate of
pumping is faster,

01:00:41.099 --> 01:00:45.327
the city sinks faster and
there's--the pipes eventually

01:00:45.327 --> 01:00:50.260
get twisted and they rupture so
there's now 40,000 repaired--

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:53.880
ruptures that they repair each
year and many more that they--

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:57.643
they're not even reported and
they don't get around to

01:00:57.643 --> 01:00:58.849
repairing them.
 

01:00:58.849 --> 01:01:03.659
Apparently one-third of the
water in the system leaks out,

01:01:03.659 --> 01:01:07.699
and a lot of the city lies
below the sewer lines now,

01:01:07.699 --> 01:01:10.250
so the sewage doesn't leave the
city any more,

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:13.608
it collects in pools,
and they have now had to

01:01:13.608 --> 01:01:17.340
construct vast pumping stations
to pump it out--

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:21.880
the sewage back out from these
pools.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:27.057
They have--they're building a
whole new, much deeper sewage

01:01:27.057 --> 01:01:31.969
system, they're building 124
miles of 80 foot sewers.

01:01:31.969 --> 01:01:33.469
That's enough of that.
 

01:01:33.469 --> 01:01:37.519
I think you get the message
here.

01:01:37.519 --> 01:01:41.820
Let me have a few more minutes.
 

01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:43.949
I put in your reading and just
something that you may think,

01:01:43.949 --> 01:01:47.309
well, why did he put that in,
is how much is being paid for

01:01:47.309 --> 01:01:49.570
caviar and fish and things like
that.

01:01:49.570 --> 01:01:53.166
Its part of a longer piece that
I'm not going to have time talk

01:01:53.166 --> 01:01:55.885
about,
but there's a lot of fish in

01:01:55.885 --> 01:01:58.246
the sea,
but there's a lot of people

01:01:58.246 --> 01:02:01.329
that want to eat fish,
so fishing is one of those

01:02:01.329 --> 01:02:05.210
industries that's really just
cleaning out the sea of fish.

01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:08.106
When there were small boats,
things were okay,

01:02:08.106 --> 01:02:09.909
the fish could regenerate.
 

01:02:09.909 --> 01:02:12.786
But now Korea,
and East Germany,

01:02:12.786 --> 01:02:16.974
and Japan have these huge,
huge ships that have

01:02:16.974 --> 01:02:21.456
miles--their nets are miles and
miles long and they just suck

01:02:21.456 --> 01:02:25.789
everything out of the sea so the
fish are disappearing.

01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:30.590
You'd think that economically
that as the fish disappear,

01:02:30.590 --> 01:02:33.599
and even when they can't
reproduce themselves,

01:02:33.599 --> 01:02:40.389
it would get the--uneconomical
to catch the fish anymore.

01:02:40.389 --> 01:02:44.070
In actual fact what happens is
that,

01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:47.295
in the fishing,
there's presumably good fish

01:02:47.295 --> 01:02:50.529
that people like to eat,
and what happens is,

01:02:50.529 --> 01:02:54.340
as those get fished out you go
down to the next level of fish.

01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:56.706
If you've been going to
restaurants a while you see

01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:59.309
this, every couple of years
there's some new fish on the

01:02:59.309 --> 01:03:00.920
menu that I've never heard of.
 

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:03.639
Have you had that experience?
 

01:03:03.639 --> 01:03:06.438
That's because the fish that
you ate two or three years are

01:03:06.438 --> 01:03:09.235
now gone because they've been
fished out, so the quality of

01:03:09.235 --> 01:03:10.780
the fish goes down and down.
 

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:15.349
If people have money,
they still want to buy the

01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:20.795
better quality fish and it turns
out they will pay almost

01:03:20.795 --> 01:03:24.880
anything for this better quality
fish.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.670
What happens is then,
instead of the economics

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:30.271
working for you,
that as it gets more expensive

01:03:30.271 --> 01:03:32.447
to catch fish,
you let off on the fish,

01:03:32.447 --> 01:03:36.677
the price of the fish goes up,
so that it's still worthwhile

01:03:36.677 --> 01:03:38.369
to catch those fish.
 

01:03:38.369 --> 01:03:40.840
What happens then that
the--because of that economics,

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:45.092
the pressure to catch these
fish to extinction keeps up

01:03:45.092 --> 01:03:49.739
there and some of the outrageous
prices that I gave you,

01:03:49.739 --> 01:03:56.190
that's the point of that kind
of stuff.

01:03:56.190 --> 01:04:00.494
What you should realize is that
environmental destruction is

01:04:00.494 --> 01:04:04.510
essentially--most of it--a lot
of it is irreversible.

01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:05.711
Loss of species is
irreversible,

01:04:05.711 --> 01:04:07.730
I mean if you want to wait
hundred million years,

01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:11.186
yes species will differentiate
and you'll get new species but

01:04:11.186 --> 01:04:13.030
that's basically irreversible.
 

01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:17.766
Things like fishing out various
species in the sea so that they

01:04:17.766 --> 01:04:21.510
don't recover is an irreversible
kind of thing.

01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:24.639
Loss of habitat is generally
irreversible.

01:04:24.639 --> 01:04:28.210
I think I described to you
northeast of Brazil where,

01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:31.617
or all of Brazil,
all of any jungle region where

01:04:31.617 --> 01:04:35.606
the whole ecosystem is kept
going by the amount of fungi

01:04:35.606 --> 01:04:38.869
that recycle the nutrients in
the jungle.

01:04:38.869 --> 01:04:41.369
When you cut down the trees the
sun beats down,

01:04:41.369 --> 01:04:44.222
kills the fungi,
you no longer have this mat of

01:04:44.222 --> 01:04:46.838
fungi,
so now something falls into it,

01:04:46.838 --> 01:04:50.130
it doesn't get decomposed,
the nutrients don't go back

01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:50.980
into the trees.
 

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:54.498
The whole land dries out and
becomes what they call laterite

01:04:54.498 --> 01:04:58.077
which is hard soil,
hard like rock soil,

01:04:58.077 --> 01:05:02.159
and it's not clear that that
ever,

01:05:02.159 --> 01:05:04.920
ever can recover.
 

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.730
Fish stocks.
 

01:05:06.730 --> 01:05:10.728
The cod stocks declined like
20,30 years ago and they really

01:05:10.728 --> 01:05:14.014
have not come back,
even though they've really cut

01:05:14.014 --> 01:05:16.409
down the fishing and banned it
mostly,

01:05:16.409 --> 01:05:18.840
they're not coming back.
 

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:23.909
There's apparently too small of
a population for the

01:05:23.909 --> 01:05:27.389
reproduction system to work
well.

01:05:27.389 --> 01:05:30.554
Because this is irreversible,
because--this is a very

01:05:30.554 --> 01:05:33.414
important point,
because environmental damage is

01:05:33.414 --> 01:05:35.909
irreversible as population
increases.

01:05:35.909 --> 01:05:38.768
As the world economy increases,
the pressure on the environment

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:39.829
gets worse and worse.
 

01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:43.740
You can imagine a nice scenario
where eventually population

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:47.449
comes down and maybe some of the
pressure is let off.

01:05:47.449 --> 01:05:50.039
But, what you'll have to worry
about is that peak because the

01:05:50.039 --> 01:05:52.239
things that are going to
disappear irreversibly,

01:05:52.239 --> 01:05:53.777
your species,
your habitat,

01:05:53.777 --> 01:05:56.440
your so forth depend not on the
level now,

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:59.059
but on the maximum demand.
 

01:05:59.059 --> 01:06:02.322
That once the maximum--When and
if the maximum demand comes off

01:06:02.322 --> 01:06:02.849
it's ok.
 

01:06:02.849 --> 01:06:10.161
What we have to worry about is
this peak size of population and

01:06:10.161 --> 01:06:14.289
other demands on the
environment.

01:06:14.289 --> 01:06:17.480
it's this peak size that
becomes important.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:21.744
We've seen the great range of
variability in the UN

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:22.940
projections.
 

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:25.670
We could reach a peak at a
billion more people,

01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:26.885
or two billion,
or three, or four,

01:06:26.885 --> 01:06:28.306
or five,
or six, or seven,

01:06:28.306 --> 01:06:31.891
or 12, or who knows how many
more billions and which of those

01:06:31.891 --> 01:06:35.000
curves happens is not going to
be a random event.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.820
It depends on what humans do
right now.

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:43.139
Because of momentum,
the people that are born now

01:06:43.139 --> 01:06:48.539
are going to have children and
they're a cumulative factor in

01:06:48.539 --> 01:06:50.340
the environment.
 

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:52.320
So whatever the birth rate now
is,

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.659
whatever the population growth
rate is now,

01:06:54.659 --> 01:06:57.483
if that eventually stops
there's still momentum for

01:06:57.483 --> 01:06:59.010
another 100 or 150 years.
 

01:06:59.010 --> 01:07:02.139
I showed you the data from
various countries showing that,

01:07:02.139 --> 01:07:04.539
even after they reach
replacement level fertility,

01:07:04.539 --> 01:07:09.429
their population grows for
another 100 years or so forth.

01:07:09.429 --> 01:07:12.855
Again, what we do now
determines the maximum

01:07:12.855 --> 01:07:16.360
environmental destruction that's
going on.

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:19.250
I think one of the most
important points is that

01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:21.710
environmental solutions are
difficult.

01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:25.079
It is not an easy job to fix
the environment.

01:07:25.079 --> 01:07:27.543
Like global warming,
there's huge arguments whether

01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:30.599
we should try to prevent or
should we just try to adapt it,

01:07:30.599 --> 01:07:33.659
and I think half your courses
in the Forestry School are,

01:07:33.659 --> 01:07:33.829
'No.
 

01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:36.329
It's better to let it happen
and it's going to be cheaper to

01:07:36.329 --> 01:07:37.219
adapt to it."
 

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:39.465
And the other half of the
courses are saying "It's a

01:07:39.465 --> 01:07:41.148
horrible thing,
we've got to try to prevent

01:07:41.148 --> 01:07:41.670
it."
 

01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:44.510
Mostly, like using solar power,
wind power--

01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:49.375
the costs--nuclear power even,
the costs are so very high that

01:07:49.375 --> 01:07:53.682
with current technology the
alternatives are really not

01:07:53.682 --> 01:07:54.719
feasible.
 

01:07:54.719 --> 01:07:56.811
What's happening is,
China is building a new coal

01:07:56.811 --> 01:07:57.639
plant every week.
 

01:07:57.639 --> 01:08:00.769
They would love to reduce their
pollution.

01:08:00.769 --> 01:08:02.349
They've done whatever they can.
 

01:08:02.349 --> 01:08:05.135
But their population is still
growing, they have that huge

01:08:05.135 --> 01:08:07.090
poor population,
they need the energy.

01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:09.909
They have no choice now but to
build power plants.

01:08:09.909 --> 01:08:11.159
What do you tell the Chinese to
do?

01:08:11.159 --> 01:08:15.155
No, you people should keep
being poor, don't build the coal

01:08:15.155 --> 01:08:16.189
power plants.
 

01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:18.685
Well we don't say that and
they're not going to do it

01:08:18.685 --> 01:08:21.467
anyway, because their people
demand some decent standard of

01:08:21.467 --> 01:08:23.100
living, which requires energy.
 

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:29.109
So the CO_2 in the
air goes crazy.

01:08:29.109 --> 01:08:33.685
There are no easy fixes for the
environment from that kind of

01:08:33.685 --> 01:08:34.220
side.
 

01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:37.810
It's a really very hard job.
 

01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:41.914
The only success that one could
really claim in the last say 50

01:08:41.914 --> 01:08:45.755
years for what you might call
the environmental movement is

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:49.319
the population,
is on the population front.

01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:51.417
You've seen,
I've shown you many,

01:08:51.417 --> 01:08:54.170
many times that around the
third world,

01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:57.649
up until 1950,1960,
the birthrate was six,

01:08:57.649 --> 01:09:02.420
seven, eight people--children
per woman and now it's dropped

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:06.010
to below half that,
in fact to about 2.8.

01:09:06.010 --> 01:09:08.680
So it's something like less
than half of that;

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:13.600
enormous progress in that area.
 

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.001
I've shown you again in many
different ways that people want

01:09:17.001 --> 01:09:20.632
fewer children in every country,
every developing country of the

01:09:20.632 --> 01:09:21.210
world.
 

01:09:21.210 --> 01:09:24.323
You ask, how many they want
and--you find out how many they

01:09:24.323 --> 01:09:24.698
have.
 

01:09:24.698 --> 01:09:27.701
In every country the number
that they're having is above

01:09:27.701 --> 01:09:29.720
what they want and massive
effects.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:31.895
There's usually--like Bolivia
which is not one of your most

01:09:31.895 --> 01:09:34.451
advanced countries,
and universally around the

01:09:34.451 --> 01:09:37.242
world 70%,
80% of the women want to not

01:09:37.242 --> 01:09:38.310
have children.
 

01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:43.400
70% just totally don't want it;
another 10%--well not in the

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:44.859
next two years.
 

01:09:44.859 --> 01:09:49.328
The technology we have,
condoms are not wonderful,

01:09:49.328 --> 01:09:51.328
birth control pills are not
wonderful,

01:09:51.328 --> 01:09:54.951
and they're not wonderful,
but they're good enough to do

01:09:54.951 --> 01:09:55.609
the job.
 

01:09:55.609 --> 01:10:01.188
Population is the rare issue
where a lot has been done and a

01:10:01.188 --> 01:10:02.890
lot can be done.
 

01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:05.050
We don't have to win the hearts
and minds of the people;

01:10:05.050 --> 01:10:08.130
they're already telling us they
want fewer children than they're

01:10:08.130 --> 01:10:08.569
having.
 

01:10:08.569 --> 01:10:10.238
We don't need new technology.
 

01:10:10.238 --> 01:10:13.417
It's dirt cheap compared to
the--compared to getting rid of

01:10:13.417 --> 01:10:15.720
carbon in the atmosphere or
reducing it.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:18.671
It's dirt cheap,
I mean a cycle of pills on the

01:10:18.671 --> 01:10:21.559
world market is $0.80,
a diaphragm is a $1.25,

01:10:21.559 --> 01:10:23.868
I mean we're talking dirt
cheap.

01:10:23.868 --> 01:10:27.104
The medical knowledge to
provide these things is almost

01:10:27.104 --> 01:10:30.520
at the barefoot doctor level so
you don't need very highly

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:34.154
trained personnel,
and as I mentioned to you,

01:10:34.154 --> 01:10:39.269
labor and even educated labor
in the developing countries is

01:10:39.269 --> 01:10:40.050
cheap.
 

01:10:43.078 --> 01:10:45.911
Of all the possible things one
can do to improve the

01:10:45.911 --> 01:10:50.177
environmental situation,
it looks to me like encouraging

01:10:50.177 --> 01:10:55.270
the continued decline of
fertility is the easiest thing.

01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:58.090
You don't have to spend a lot
of money,

01:10:58.090 --> 01:11:00.460
most of the people in the world
will be 'Yeah,

01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:03.872
rah, rah, I want that,' and
we've seen from Ryerson's

01:11:03.872 --> 01:11:06.760
lecture here that with a very
little bit--

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:11.078
I mean he puts on one soap
opera which runs for two,

01:11:11.078 --> 01:11:14.322
three times a week for like a
year which is significant but

01:11:14.322 --> 01:11:16.670
very small intervention and very
cheap,

01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:19.457
and the number of people going
to family planning clinics

01:11:19.457 --> 01:11:21.198
doubles and triples and it
just--

01:11:21.198 --> 01:11:24.307
an incredible amount of
progress with a very small

01:11:24.307 --> 01:11:26.319
input,
so this is a very,

01:11:26.319 --> 01:11:27.840
very doable thing.
 

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.470
We have a long way to go.
 

01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:31.440
The fertility,
as I've said,

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:35.164
has come down from six,
seven, and eight to 2.6 as a

01:11:35.164 --> 01:11:40.130
global average but 2.6 is still
a 30% increase every generation.

01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:44.666
Population growth,
I've just showed you is about a

01:11:44.666 --> 01:11:48.000
billion people every 13 years
now.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.109
It's still very high.
 

01:11:49.109 --> 01:11:53.779
Bringing it down further is
probably the only feasible,

01:11:53.779 --> 01:11:58.448
reasonably realistic thing that
one can do to massive--

01:11:58.448 --> 01:12:01.603
I mean the environment is going
to hell at such a massive rate

01:12:01.603 --> 01:12:04.034
--
we need some massive change and

01:12:04.034 --> 01:12:08.126
I don't think anything else
comes close to what you can do

01:12:08.126 --> 01:12:09.488
with population.
 

01:12:09.488 --> 01:12:12.626
I challenge the
environmentalists all the time,

01:12:12.626 --> 01:12:16.988
and I say, look every 13 years
there's another billion people.

01:12:16.988 --> 01:12:20.452
Add up all the
environmental--all that

01:12:20.452 --> 01:12:23.181
conservation,
that environmentalists have

01:12:23.181 --> 01:12:25.010
ever done,
all the restoration,

01:12:25.010 --> 01:12:28.979
add that up and compare that to
a footprint of a billion people

01:12:28.979 --> 01:12:29.939
in 13 years.
 

01:12:29.939 --> 01:12:34.350
It's not in the same--you're
just not in the same ballpark

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:37.680
and yet that message doesn't get
through.

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:40.550
There's a wonderful quote,
and this is (maybe the--

01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:44.920
cameras don't even want it),
that Peter Beard,

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:48.194
who's one of the most famous
conservation writers in Africa

01:12:48.194 --> 01:12:51.751
and he's very outspoken and does
not use polite language all the

01:12:51.751 --> 01:12:52.260
time.
 

01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:55.438
This is a quote from him,
"I broke my ass to do

01:12:55.438 --> 01:12:56.630
these conscientious books."
 

01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:59.479
He did all kinds of books on
the environment in Africa.

01:12:59.479 --> 01:13:02.319
"But the public's not
getting it at all.

01:13:02.319 --> 01:13:06.002
You show them photographs of
30,000 carcasses with the ivory

01:13:06.002 --> 01:13:09.000
tusks still in place,"
that's elephants--

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.061
30,000 ivory elephants,
"And the tusks are still

01:13:12.061 --> 01:13:15.417
in place and they try to tell
you that we should prosecute

01:13:15.417 --> 01:13:18.010
poachers"
as if that was the issue.

01:13:18.010 --> 01:13:21.144
"Doesn't anyone realize
that people are hungry and using

01:13:21.144 --> 01:13:22.448
these animals for food?
 

01:13:22.448 --> 01:13:24.500
People still think its wild
Africa.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:27.975
Doesn't anyone realize that
this is all about population

01:13:27.975 --> 01:13:28.670
pressure?
 

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:31.551
What the"--and he uses the
'F' word, "What the 'F's'

01:13:31.551 --> 01:13:34.010
going on out there in the
CONservation word?"

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:37.073
He capitalizes "con"
as for con job,

01:13:37.073 --> 01:13:40.408
"Nothing but lies,
fundraising lies."

01:13:40.408 --> 01:13:43.020
I think we are--I mean he
overstates things,

01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:45.693
and as you know,
that's one of my pedagogical

01:13:45.693 --> 01:13:48.670
tools is to engage somewhat in
overstatement.

01:13:48.670 --> 01:13:53.310
You remember it though.
 

01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:56.298
The whole environmental
movement has got its head in the

01:13:56.298 --> 01:13:59.613
sand about the one thing that
could really probably make a big

01:13:59.613 --> 01:14:00.430
difference.
 

01:14:00.430 --> 01:14:04.710
Just to conclude,
the earth is in a big race.

01:14:04.710 --> 01:14:08.141
I've shown you population is
increasing, environmental

01:14:08.141 --> 01:14:11.770
problems are increasing,
but fertility is coming down.

01:14:11.770 --> 01:14:16.020
Depending on how these two
countervailing forces work,

01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:19.238
in the future we will either
come to a smooth landing,

01:14:19.238 --> 01:14:21.826
a soft landing,
that fertility will come down

01:14:21.826 --> 01:14:24.940
fast enough that takes the
pressure off the increasing

01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:27.579
environmental issues,
or it won't,

01:14:27.579 --> 01:14:31.560
or population won't come down
fast enough.

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.899
Then we're off into who knows
what.

01:14:34.899 --> 01:14:37.560
That's I think what to take
away from this course,

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:41.460
the tremendous race between the
increase of population,

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:45.408
a billion people every 13
years, the decline in fertility,

01:14:45.408 --> 01:14:49.646
a decline since 1960 in about
40,50 years declined to more

01:14:49.646 --> 01:14:50.538
than half.
 

01:14:50.538 --> 01:14:55.212
How is that race going to be
won and what are we--which side

01:14:55.212 --> 01:14:59.807
is going to win that race and
what can we politically--what

01:14:59.807 --> 01:15:01.630
can we do about it?
 

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:03.600
Have a good summer and have a
good test.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:07.899
&gt;

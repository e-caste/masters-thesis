00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.883
Professor David Blight:
We're going to elect,

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:17.580
that is re-elect,
Lincoln in a moment,

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.734
the election of 1864 being one
of the, without a question,

00:00:22.734 --> 00:00:25.990
crucial turning points in the
war,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.160
in a war that was so political.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.071
But spare the poets.
I want to begin by placing you

00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:39.260
somewhere.
The ending of the Civil War,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.130
of course, was for thousands
upon thousands,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.755
really millions of Americans,
a confrontation with death on a

00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:52.740
scale they'd never known,
never experienced,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.710
and frankly never have again.
There's a marvelous new book on

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.736
this, two new books on this,
one in particular by Drew

00:00:59.736 --> 00:01:01.724
Faust,
whom you've read already,

00:01:01.724 --> 00:01:04.438
a book called The Republic
of Suffering,

00:01:04.438 --> 00:01:07.801
which I recommend to
you--it just came out a couple

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:11.282
of months ago--which is all
about the death culture that the

00:01:11.282 --> 00:01:12.580
Civil War bred.

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:18.650
Our greatest death poet was
Whitman.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.190
This is risky.
I'm going to actually recite a

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.848
little piece,
little bits,

00:01:23.848 --> 00:01:26.502
of what could be Whitman's
greatest poem,

00:01:26.502 --> 00:01:29.120
at least it in my view.
But what do I know?

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.390
I'm not a literary scholar.

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:37.363
But there are ways in Whitman's
"When Lilacs Last in the

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:41.023
Dooryard Bloom'd" that he is
actually anticipating what's

00:01:41.023 --> 00:01:44.979
going to happen,
with time, to the problem of

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.657
how Americans will remember this
ghastly bloodletting they've

00:01:50.657 --> 00:01:53.360
just experienced.
It's, of course,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.118
the poem about Lincoln's death.
Whitman really had a thing

00:01:57.118 --> 00:01:59.750
about Lincoln,
as you may know.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.340
He wrote possibly the only poem
that ever rhymed in his

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.230
magnificent collection,
"O Captain!

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.310
My Captain," in relation to
Lincoln's death.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.420
But "Lilacs" is a masterpiece.

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:23.803
It's the poem he wrote to try
to imagine the funeral train of

00:02:23.803 --> 00:02:28.122
Abraham Lincoln,
the train that took some twenty

00:02:28.122 --> 00:02:29.858
days;
three coffins,

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:32.568
because two got damaged.
It stopped in,

00:02:32.568 --> 00:02:35.757
I forget now,
sixteen, seventeen different

00:02:35.757 --> 00:02:40.346
cities on this incredible tour
all over New England and then

00:02:40.346 --> 00:02:44.546
all across the North and the
Midwest and finally to his

00:02:44.546 --> 00:02:47.580
burial in Springfield,
Illinois.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.410
And what Whitman really wrote
here was a kind of a

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.530
calming--it's written in a mood
of a kind a calming,

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.471
depoliticized,
contemplation on what Whitman

00:02:57.471 --> 00:03:01.596
called "the fathomless,
sure-enwinding arms of

00:03:01.596 --> 00:03:06.415
cool-enfolding death."
But it's very much directly

00:03:06.415 --> 00:03:12.470
about Lincoln's death.
And Whitman imagines a songbird;

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.250
calls it a warbling.

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:22.191
And he says he hears this
warbling singing a solitary

00:03:22.191 --> 00:03:26.120
song, his words,
"of the bleeding throat,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.373
Death's outlet song of life,
(for well dear brother)"--he's

00:03:30.373 --> 00:03:34.699
speaking to the bird now--"(for
well dear brother I know,

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:39.763
If thou wast not granted to
sing thou wouldst surely die.)"

00:03:39.763 --> 00:03:44.389
And he's trying to use the
bird--go read this poem,

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.721
read it three,
four, and five times--he's

00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:49.460
trying to use the warbling,
the song sparrow,

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.090
as a metaphor for all of
America.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.690
"How shall I warble?"
Here he gives voice to the bird.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.139
He even writes lyrics for the
bird.

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:07.440
"How shall I warble myself for
the dead one that I loved?"

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.514
It's like an offering.
Whitman picks a sprig of lilac,

00:04:11.514 --> 00:04:15.900
he says, and places Abraham
Lincoln's funeral train in the

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.669
setting of what he calls "ever
returning spring across the vast

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.389
landscape of America,
from east to the prairie."

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.089
It was April,
like now, a little later;

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:33.519
lilacs were in bloom by late in
the month.

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:36.949
And then comes this magnificent
verse.

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.460
"Over the breast of spring,
the land, amidst cities,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.870
Amid lanes and through old
woods,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.026
where lately the violets peep'd
from the ground,

00:04:46.026 --> 00:04:49.586
spotting the grey debris,
Amid the grass in the fields

00:04:49.586 --> 00:04:53.524
each side of the lanes,
passing the endless grass,

00:04:53.524 --> 00:04:57.855
Passing the yellow-spear'd
wheat, every grain from its

00:04:57.855 --> 00:05:01.370
shroud in the dark brown fields
uprisen,

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.872
Passing the apple-tree blows of
white and pink in the orchards,

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:09.939
Carrying a corpse to where it
shall rest in the grave,

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:13.329
Night and day journeys a
coffin."

00:05:13.329 --> 00:05:18.680
And then he says the bird must
sing its "carol of death."

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.201
And the poet tries to give
words to the music,

00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:24.939
yet one senses that even
Whitman,

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:29.591
with all his powers,
could not match the little

00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:34.343
warbling's power,
to deliver what he calls "that

00:05:34.343 --> 00:05:41.197
powerful psalm in the night."
This is a poem of grief for the

00:05:41.197 --> 00:05:44.679
whole country.
He's trying to capture the

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:46.869
meaning of death,
all that death,

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:49.949
caused in the Civil War,
if it's possible.

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.660
But he gives the job to a tiny
little bird.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.185
Whitman himself,
he says, is left with

00:05:57.185 --> 00:06:00.528
"visions," his words,
"of battle-corpses" and "the

00:06:00.528 --> 00:06:04.759
debris of all the slain soldiers
of the war," in his head.

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:10.405
The funeral train passes by all
the images the poet can muster

00:06:10.405 --> 00:06:16.144
and then he's just left to say,
his words: "The living remained

00:06:16.144 --> 00:06:17.810
and suffered."

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:32.014
Now I'll return to Whitman.
It's one way to get a handle,

00:06:32.014 --> 00:06:36.949
if it is a handle,
on what Americans were coping

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:40.889
with in 1865,
the level and scale of

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.690
sacrifice that they had
experienced.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.009
And of course Lincoln's
assassination came two,

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:54.550
three days after Robert E.
Lee's surrender at Appomattox.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.291
More on that in a minute.
But back up with me,

00:06:58.291 --> 00:07:01.509
back up with me into that last
year of the war.

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:08.009
It was still possible for the
South to win its version of a

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:12.939
victory as late as I'd say
August of 1864;

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:16.988
I suppose you could even say
September, but after the fall of

00:07:16.988 --> 00:07:19.796
Atlanta it wasn't likely.
But now quickly,

00:07:19.796 --> 00:07:23.251
that election of '64 was one of
the most important in our

00:07:23.251 --> 00:07:25.257
history.
We don't pay a lot of attention

00:07:25.257 --> 00:07:27.911
to it because we kind of speed
by it or around it and we almost

00:07:27.911 --> 00:07:30.010
ignore it sometimes--oh it's
another election,

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.190
let's get on with the Civil War.

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:37.552
Across the North there was
tremendous war weariness that

00:07:37.552 --> 00:07:40.069
summer.
I mentioned already,

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:45.769
65 -- 66,0000 casualties in
Grant's Army alone in Virginia

00:07:45.769 --> 00:07:50.672
in two and a half months.
There was great bitterness

00:07:50.672 --> 00:07:55.136
against the draft that summer.
Now, in the end only about six,

00:07:55.136 --> 00:07:58.354
seven percent of all Union
soldiers will actually be

00:07:58.354 --> 00:08:01.635
draftees, but there was
tremendous resentment against

00:08:01.635 --> 00:08:04.956
it.
In the North there were the

00:08:04.956 --> 00:08:08.104
Peace Democrats;
or sometimes that's what they

00:08:08.104 --> 00:08:10.028
were called.
Sometimes they were called

00:08:10.028 --> 00:08:11.740
Copperheads, named for the
snake.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:16.023
Copperheads usually though were
those people who somehow were

00:08:16.023 --> 00:08:20.306
deemed truly disloyal to the
Union and actually were engaging

00:08:20.306 --> 00:08:24.589
in machinations and conspiracies
to overthrow the Union.

00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:27.529
That's always been an open
question.

00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:31.501
There was an effort within the
Republican Party as early as May

00:08:31.501 --> 00:08:35.730
and June of '64 to dump Lincoln
in place of either Salmon Chase,

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:40.434
a member of Lincoln's cabinet,
his Attorney General--and read

00:08:40.434 --> 00:08:44.982
Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team
of Rivals if you want to

00:08:44.982 --> 00:08:49.530
know just how much Chase was
scheming to dump Lincoln,

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.010
as his own Attorney General.

00:08:54.309 --> 00:08:57.307
Chase may have had the most
beautiful daughter in

00:08:57.307 --> 00:09:00.179
Washington, Kate Chase,
but he had no style.

00:09:00.179 --> 00:09:03.510
And then there was an effort to
dump Lincoln in favor of the

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.106
candidate John C.
Fremont, the same Fremont who

00:09:06.106 --> 00:09:08.646
had run in 1856 as the
Republican presidential

00:09:08.646 --> 00:09:11.901
candidate.
And Lincoln was himself all but

00:09:11.901 --> 00:09:15.086
convinced, by July and early
August of '64,

00:09:15.086 --> 00:09:18.500
that he probably wouldn't win
re-election;

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:24.842
what to do in the meantime?
The Democratic Party nominated

00:09:24.842 --> 00:09:27.199
George B.
McClellan, the former general,

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:30.159
commanding General of the Army
of the Potomac.

00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:34.463
That Democratic Party in the
midst of the Civil War was a

00:09:34.463 --> 00:09:37.383
confusing lot,
and one might even say a

00:09:37.383 --> 00:09:40.630
confused lot.
Some of them truly wanted to

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:44.582
sue for a negotiated peace,
but they would always say they

00:09:44.582 --> 00:09:48.880
wanted a negotiated peace of the
South that would still restore

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.850
the Union.
And, of course,

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:54.016
that was never acceptable to
Jefferson Davis and the

00:09:54.016 --> 00:09:57.347
Confederate government.
Many of them were quite

00:09:57.347 --> 00:10:01.605
explicitly for a negotiated
peace that would not result in

00:10:01.605 --> 00:10:03.916
emancipation.
They wanted to turn

00:10:03.916 --> 00:10:07.132
emancipation around.
They wanted a Union without

00:10:07.132 --> 00:10:10.133
emancipation;
that is exactly what McClellan

00:10:10.133 --> 00:10:12.738
wanted.
There was a deeply white

00:10:12.738 --> 00:10:17.762
supremacist strain in much of
the northern Democratic Party

00:10:17.762 --> 00:10:23.220
and they put up a formidable
challenge to wartime president,

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:27.294
in the midst of Civil War.
They painted Lincoln and the

00:10:27.294 --> 00:10:30.228
Republicans as what they
constantly called

00:10:30.228 --> 00:10:32.889
miscegenationist;
they used the term all the time.

00:10:32.889 --> 00:10:35.797
The Republicans were going to
make whites and blacks marry

00:10:35.797 --> 00:10:38.773
each other.
They called Abraham Lincoln,

00:10:38.773 --> 00:10:42.159
in this campaign,
"Abe the widow maker."

00:10:42.159 --> 00:10:45.886
They were already waving the
bloody shirt that would become

00:10:45.886 --> 00:10:49.997
so ubiquitous in the wake of the
war, blaming Lincoln for all the

00:10:49.997 --> 00:10:52.858
death.
They also referred to him as

00:10:52.858 --> 00:10:56.779
"Abe the nigger lover."
And the Democratic papers

00:10:56.779 --> 00:11:00.576
produced cartoons,
famous cartoons--I wish I had

00:11:00.576 --> 00:11:06.070
an example of one today--of what
they called miscegenation balls;

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:10.984
these were dances and balls
where whites and blacks all came

00:11:10.984 --> 00:11:15.149
together, kissed,
made love and mixed the races.

00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:21.109
What Lincoln desperately needed
was battlefield success to alter

00:11:21.109 --> 00:11:26.620
Northern war morale;
and of course they got that.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:31.030
They got it with the fall of
Mobile Harbor in the first and

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.679
second week of August--Admiral
David Farragut,

00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:38.146
in the largest naval engagement
of the war, took Mobile,

00:11:38.146 --> 00:11:40.289
the last major southern
seaport,

00:11:40.289 --> 00:11:46.626
to come into Union hands--and
then especially with the fall of

00:11:46.626 --> 00:11:50.990
Atlanta, on the 3^(rd) of
September '64.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:55.092
And then in the month of
September further victories by

00:11:55.092 --> 00:11:59.120
Philip Sheridan's cavalry in the
Shenandoah Valley,

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.295
driving Confederate armies
basically out of the Shenandoah

00:12:03.295 --> 00:12:07.911
Valley, made it now possible to
say that the war was on a course

00:12:07.911 --> 00:12:11.808
of Union victory,
that the Confederacy was in a

00:12:11.808 --> 00:12:17.353
state of near collapse.
And when the election came the

00:12:17.353 --> 00:12:21.752
votes were there.
Lincoln won fifty-five percent

00:12:21.752 --> 00:12:25.190
of the total popular vote.
Forty-five percent of the

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.428
electorate in the northern
states did not vote for Lincoln

00:12:28.428 --> 00:12:30.927
and in effect,
therefore, were not voting for

00:12:30.927 --> 00:12:33.206
emancipation.
Keep that in mind when we start

00:12:33.206 --> 00:12:34.300
discussing Reconstruction.

00:12:38.129 --> 00:12:42.491
Eighteen of the Free states
made it possible for soldiers to

00:12:42.491 --> 00:12:45.497
vote at the front;
only two did not,

00:12:45.497 --> 00:12:49.629
and even those let soldiers
vote by absentee.

00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:53.721
It is the first time in world
history, so far as we know,

00:12:53.721 --> 00:12:57.520
that a republic in the
midst--there weren't that many

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.549
republics to speak of,
of course--but the first time

00:13:01.549 --> 00:13:05.807
in the course of a civil war
that a republic held a general

00:13:05.807 --> 00:13:09.295
election and pulled it off.
Most importantly,

00:13:09.295 --> 00:13:13.530
Lincoln won an extraordinary
seventy-eight percent of the

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:16.399
soldier vote,
of all those hundreds of

00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:20.410
thousands in the Army and Navy,
and they voted in droves.

00:13:23.659 --> 00:13:27.461
It was, that election,
a referendum on the war,

00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:31.676
and it was a referendum on its
purpose, and it was a

00:13:31.676 --> 00:13:35.230
referendum, therefore,
on emancipation.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:39.769
One of the most extraordinary
events that happened in that

00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:44.309
election season was in the third
week of August of '64,

00:13:44.309 --> 00:13:48.455
Lincoln invited--this time
invited--Frederick Douglass to

00:13:48.455 --> 00:13:52.363
come to the White House.
They had met the year before in

00:13:52.363 --> 00:13:55.242
August, in '63,
but that was at Douglass's own

00:13:55.242 --> 00:13:57.909
prodding.
In '63 Douglass had gone to the

00:13:57.909 --> 00:14:01.033
White House to complain about
unequal pay and brutal

00:14:01.033 --> 00:14:04.710
discriminations against black
troops in the Union armies,

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.880
and he got an audience,
at least for awhile,

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.899
with Lincoln--the first time
they met,

00:14:08.899 --> 00:14:12.259
the beginnings of a remarkable
relationship.

00:14:12.259 --> 00:14:16.126
But in '64 Lincoln invites
Douglass--and Douglass didn't

00:14:16.126 --> 00:14:19.149
know what he was going to be
asked to do.

00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:22.189
And they sat down for about
forty-five minutes,

00:14:22.189 --> 00:14:26.353
eye to eye, and Abraham Lincoln
asked Frederick Douglass to lead

00:14:26.353 --> 00:14:30.120
a campaign to funnel as many
slaves out of the upper south

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.159
into some kind of security in
the North,

00:14:33.159 --> 00:14:36.575
before election day in
November, because he feared he

00:14:36.575 --> 00:14:40.121
would not be re-elected and he
wanted as many slaves as

00:14:40.121 --> 00:14:43.996
possible to be secure within
Union lines and somehow legally

00:14:43.996 --> 00:14:48.375
free under the proclamation,
before McClellan won the

00:14:48.375 --> 00:14:50.642
election.
Now frankly,

00:14:50.642 --> 00:14:55.388
Douglass was stunned.
Here was Abe Lincoln asking him

00:14:55.388 --> 00:14:57.330
to be John Brown,
sort of.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:02.570
He could hardly believe it,
and he left there with a whole

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.879
new kind of conception of
Lincoln,

00:15:05.879 --> 00:15:09.110
frankly--not entirely new,
he was already working on that.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.625
But he went back home to
Rochester, New York and he

00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:15.720
organized about fifteen or
sixteen agents,

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.880
by letter and telegram,
in late August and the first

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.360
week of September,
all over the North.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.745
He didn't have a clue how he
was really going to do this,

00:15:23.745 --> 00:15:25.960
or how much the army was really
going to help him,

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.176
but he started calling all his
old friends in the abolition

00:15:28.176 --> 00:15:30.240
movement, and a lot of the
people who'd been recruiting

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.099
black troops,
and said, "Help me,

00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:34.900
we're gonna funnel slaves out
of the South.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:39.709
I don't know how but help me."
And then came the fall of

00:15:39.709 --> 00:15:44.616
Atlanta, a couple of Sheridan's
victories in the Shenandoah,

00:15:44.616 --> 00:15:47.860
and the whole scheme was called
off.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:53.326
But it's a measure of Lincoln's
own sense of reality,

00:15:53.326 --> 00:15:58.427
that he was about to lose.
All right, the war ended,

00:15:58.427 --> 00:16:03.519
of course, in great part with
the surrender at Appomattox,

00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:07.820
and then with the surrender of
Joseph Johnston to Sherman in a

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.500
farmhouse in central North
Carolina,

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:16.535
about ten days later--what is
it, April 21,

00:16:16.535 --> 00:16:21.350
I believe?
Let me discuss that briefly.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:25.568
It's an extremely important
moment and event,

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:31.128
and the terms of that surrender
are extremely important for

00:16:31.128 --> 00:16:35.005
what's to come.
In a war that had become so

00:16:35.005 --> 00:16:39.648
political, so much about morale,
so much about public opinion,

00:16:39.648 --> 00:16:44.140
so much about the will of two
peoples to see it through.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.181
The surrender terms were
actually almost utterly

00:16:50.181 --> 00:16:51.000
apolitical.

00:16:54.659 --> 00:16:56.620
I had a couple of photos up
here.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.300
I don't know if you can see
this very well.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:09.596
This is one of many photographs
that Mathew Brady and his troop

00:17:09.596 --> 00:17:14.029
of photographers took of
Richmond,

00:17:14.029 --> 00:17:19.014
after it fell April 5,1865,
as so many journalists now

00:17:19.014 --> 00:17:24.468
started saying the United States
was finally an old country

00:17:24.468 --> 00:17:26.820
because it had ruins.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:35.108
Isn't that great?
You need some ruins to have a

00:17:35.108 --> 00:17:39.358
history.
Well, Richmond fell 5^(th) of

00:17:39.358 --> 00:17:43.880
April of '65,
and Lee's army did escape.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.220
He was experiencing tremendous
desertion.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:51.229
He escaped westward.
The goal he had,

00:17:51.229 --> 00:17:54.069
so far as we know,
was to reach the Blue Ridge

00:17:54.069 --> 00:17:57.730
Mountains and maybe even get
south into North Carolina,

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.421
maybe hook up with Johnston's
army that was retreating in

00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:02.440
front of Sherman up into North
Carolina,

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.779
maybe somehow connect the two
remaining Confederate armies,

00:18:06.779 --> 00:18:11.210
and carry on the war,
if they could.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:15.970
Lee really didn't ever,
ever want to give up.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:20.369
But he had to.
He was cut off.

00:18:20.369 --> 00:18:26.901
There was an emerging lethal
mixture now, of no supplies,

00:18:26.901 --> 00:18:33.317
desertion, and the almost
unfathomable oversupply of the

00:18:33.317 --> 00:18:37.907
Union forces.
He was grossly outnumbered and

00:18:37.907 --> 00:18:43.034
finally he had to send a note,
after this last little battle

00:18:43.034 --> 00:18:46.945
they actually fought,
on the 11^(th) of April,

00:18:46.945 --> 00:18:50.767
where eighteen men were killed.
And there's a little cemetery

00:18:50.767 --> 00:18:53.684
at Appomattox today where you
can see the gravestones of those

00:18:53.684 --> 00:18:55.773
eighteen men.
It's one of the most moving

00:18:55.773 --> 00:18:57.440
little cemeteries I've ever
seen.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.880
They're the last to die in a
totally futile battle.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:11.096
The terms of the surrender were
essentially this--and,

00:19:11.096 --> 00:19:16.880
by the way, they were Lincoln's
direct orders.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.995
That's a parole slip.
It's a photocopy of exactly

00:19:20.995 --> 00:19:24.469
what they looked like.
The Union Army took printing

00:19:24.469 --> 00:19:27.746
presses out to Appomattox
Courthouse, which was this

00:19:27.746 --> 00:19:30.875
little town,
and they set it up in a tavern

00:19:30.875 --> 00:19:35.206
and they pumped out these parole
slips, about 25 to 30,000 of

00:19:35.206 --> 00:19:39.701
them in forty-eight hours.
The Confederate soldiers were

00:19:39.701 --> 00:19:44.067
given these paroles.
They were allowed to keep their

00:19:44.067 --> 00:19:48.049
side arms, they had to surrender
their rifles,

00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:53.123
they were allowed to keep
horses if they had them,

00:19:53.123 --> 00:19:57.990
and in essence they were simply
told go home.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:05.130
Nobody, except technically Lee
himself, was taken into custody.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:09.661
But Lee's custody was simply
the right to ride his horse back

00:20:09.661 --> 00:20:13.897
to Richmond, if he chose,
or wherever he wanted to go,

00:20:13.897 --> 00:20:18.370
and he was technically put
under house arrest--not allowed

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:22.451
to leave his house for some
period of time--but never

00:20:22.451 --> 00:20:27.024
charged with anything.
Jefferson Davis will--more on

00:20:27.024 --> 00:20:29.072
that later.
Alexander H.

00:20:29.072 --> 00:20:33.975
Stephens, the vice-president,
will technically be charged,

00:20:33.975 --> 00:20:39.588
although never tried.
Davis will be charged but never

00:20:39.588 --> 00:20:43.680
tried.
No one, except the commandant

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.332
of Andersonville Prison,
one Captain Wirz,

00:20:48.332 --> 00:20:54.460
a Swiss born immigrant who
commanded Andersonville,

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:59.358
the worst of the South's
prisons, he was the only person

00:20:59.358 --> 00:21:04.434
accused of treason and war
crimes and executed as a result

00:21:04.434 --> 00:21:07.243
of this war.
Now Lee and Grant,

00:21:07.243 --> 00:21:11.930
of course, met--and Ken Burns
milks this for all it's worth,

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:16.125
so I'm going to let you feel it
from him--they met at the McLean

00:21:16.125 --> 00:21:18.400
House at Appomattox.
Go there someday.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.240
It still looks almost exactly
as it looked in 1865.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.940
Grant and Lee barely remembered
one another.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.887
They knew each other now--and
altogether extraordinarily

00:21:29.887 --> 00:21:32.299
well--from fighting each other
for so long.

00:21:32.299 --> 00:21:38.540
They sat down in the parlor of
this house and Grant gave Lee

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.571
the terms.
Lee dressed up in his finest

00:21:41.571 --> 00:21:43.289
golden sash.
He wore a sword.

00:21:43.289 --> 00:21:46.135
He fully expected this to be a
traditional eighteenth or

00:21:46.135 --> 00:21:50.063
nineteenth century surrender.
He was going to give his sword

00:21:50.063 --> 00:21:53.316
and all that nonsense,
but Grant just said,

00:21:53.316 --> 00:21:56.259
"I don't want your sword,
go home."

00:21:56.259 --> 00:22:02.271
Now it's also true that when
they finally cut Lee's army off,

00:22:02.271 --> 00:22:06.279
and Lee had to send that note
and say,

00:22:06.279 --> 00:22:10.898
"Please meet me to consider
surrender terms," the news just

00:22:10.898 --> 00:22:15.993
zoomed around the Union army and
Union soldiers just stated going

00:22:15.993 --> 00:22:17.539
crazy,
celebrating,

00:22:17.539 --> 00:22:21.287
screaming, shooting off guns,
riding on their horses all over

00:22:21.287 --> 00:22:23.056
the place,
"The war's over,

00:22:23.056 --> 00:22:24.848
the war's over,
the war's over,

00:22:24.848 --> 00:22:27.059
God damn rebels have
surrendered."

00:22:27.059 --> 00:22:30.364
And Grant put out an order all
through his army that there

00:22:30.364 --> 00:22:31.930
would be no celebrations.

00:22:35.099 --> 00:22:39.953
It was Grant already
understanding that the surrender

00:22:39.953 --> 00:22:45.053
had to be political too,
and that there would be

00:22:45.053 --> 00:22:52.026
tremendous untold bitterness to
deal with in the wake of this

00:22:52.026 --> 00:22:53.961
war.
Grant, as a general,

00:22:53.961 --> 00:22:56.259
had no idea what politically
would come.

00:22:56.259 --> 00:23:01.589
He wasn't involved yet in
reconstruction plans at all.

00:23:01.589 --> 00:23:05.876
But it also was a kind of
statement, of course,

00:23:05.876 --> 00:23:09.037
of honor among soldiers.
To the South,

00:23:09.037 --> 00:23:11.592
you can rest assured,
the day they heard about

00:23:11.592 --> 00:23:14.941
Appomattox was the way it was
for most Northerners about the

00:23:14.941 --> 00:23:17.609
day they heard of Lincoln's
assassination.

00:23:17.609 --> 00:23:21.339
It is all over diaries,
all over literature.

00:23:21.339 --> 00:23:26.272
It sometimes is just called
"the surrender," "the day we

00:23:26.272 --> 00:23:28.757
heard."
There's so many statements of

00:23:28.757 --> 00:23:32.170
it, throughout Southern letters
and diaries, as I've said.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:34.878
I'll just read a couple,
just briefly,

00:23:34.878 --> 00:23:39.197
and then one from a Northerner,
to show you what this moment

00:23:39.197 --> 00:23:43.149
means on both sides and how
difficult reconstruction is

00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:46.590
going to be-- just look at their
diaries.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:50.095
Remember Kate Stone?
I read from her diary before,

00:23:50.095 --> 00:23:53.891
a Louisiana planter woman who
fled over to Texas and lost most

00:23:53.891 --> 00:23:57.460
of her slaves.
She writes into her diary.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:03.559
"April 28, '65:
All are fearfully depressed,"

00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:07.696
she reports.
"I cannot bear to hear them

00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:10.490
talk of defeat."
She still hoped that

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:14.438
Confederate armies might rally
and fight, as she puts it,

00:24:14.438 --> 00:24:18.380
"to be free or die."
Easy for her to say.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:23.156
On May 15 she opened a journal
entry with this definition,

00:24:23.156 --> 00:24:28.054
that I may have read before,
where the first words are

00:24:28.054 --> 00:24:32.442
"conquered, submission,
subjugation," she says,

00:24:32.442 --> 00:24:37.437
"are the words in my heart."
And then when she hears that

00:24:37.437 --> 00:24:41.074
John Wilkes Booth has shot
Lincoln, she rejoiced in

00:24:41.074 --> 00:24:44.660
Lincoln's death and honored,
at least in her diary,

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.805
John Wilkes Booth for,
quote, "ridding the world of a

00:24:47.805 --> 00:24:50.809
tyrant.
We are glad he is not alive to

00:24:50.809 --> 00:24:55.450
rejoice in our humiliation and
insult us with his jokes."

00:24:55.450 --> 00:25:00.161
There are thousands of those
expressions in Southern letters

00:25:00.161 --> 00:25:03.445
and diaries.
That spring and summer an

00:25:03.445 --> 00:25:06.649
estimated 8 to 10,000
ex-Confederates,

00:25:06.649 --> 00:25:11.500
many of them former officers,
would flee the country.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:18.014
They ended up going to Brazil,
England, other parts of Europe,

00:25:18.014 --> 00:25:23.067
Mexico, Canada,
and a few even went as far away

00:25:23.067 --> 00:25:27.140
as Japan, for fear--I mean,
Jubal Early,

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:33.720
that conniving old rat--more on
him later--he ran to Mexico.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.995
He was certain they were all
going to be executed,

00:25:36.995 --> 00:25:41.140
at least the officer corps of
Lee's army--none of them were.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:45.509
And let me read you a diary
entry from a Northern woman,

00:25:45.509 --> 00:25:48.827
a great diarist.
Her diary's hardly known,

00:25:48.827 --> 00:25:52.829
but man, her diary is almost
equal to Mary Chestnut.

00:25:52.829 --> 00:25:56.343
I first encountered it in a
manuscript at the American

00:25:56.343 --> 00:25:58.730
Antiquarian Society in
Worchester.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.500
Her name was Caroline Barrett
White.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:05.046
She kept a diary for years,
decades, and her war-years

00:26:05.046 --> 00:26:11.019
diary is extraordinary.
This is her April 10,1865 entry.

00:26:11.019 --> 00:26:13.544
"Hurrah, hurrah,
sound the loud timbale over

00:26:13.544 --> 00:26:16.422
Egypt's dark sea.
Early this morning our ears

00:26:16.422 --> 00:26:20.339
were greeted with the sound of
bells ringing a joyous peal.

00:26:20.339 --> 00:26:24.295
General Lee had surrendered
with his whole army to General

00:26:24.295 --> 00:26:26.094
Grant!"
She's got exclamation marks all

00:26:26.094 --> 00:26:30.130
over the place.
"Surely this is the Lord's

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:35.539
doing, and it is marvelous in
our eyes."

00:26:35.539 --> 00:26:39.031
And she goes on and on and on,
all kinds of biblical cadences

00:26:39.031 --> 00:26:42.058
to talk about the sense of
jubilation she sees in the

00:26:42.058 --> 00:26:44.269
streets of her Massachusetts
town.

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:48.020
And then five days later,
April 15, comes this entry,

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:51.049
and it's the longest entry in
her diary,

00:26:51.049 --> 00:26:53.945
several pages,
and all around the outside of

00:26:53.945 --> 00:26:56.369
the pages she blackened the
edges.

00:26:56.369 --> 00:27:01.339
She writes, "The darkest day I
ever remember.

00:27:01.339 --> 00:27:05.669
This morning the sun rose upon
a nation jubilant with victory,

00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:09.359
but it sets upon one plunged
into deepest sorrow."

00:27:09.359 --> 00:27:13.597
Her longest of all diary
entries she talked about the

00:27:13.597 --> 00:27:16.938
shocking intelligence of
Lincoln's murder,

00:27:16.938 --> 00:27:20.849
and then says,
"Where will treason ever end?

00:27:20.849 --> 00:27:25.745
The rapidity with which events
crowd upon one another now is

00:27:25.745 --> 00:27:30.230
perfectly bewildering."
Indeed it was.

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:37.769
Now, as was so often the case
in this war though,

00:27:37.769 --> 00:27:42.793
Abraham Lincoln left one of the
best descriptions of what the

00:27:42.793 --> 00:27:46.003
war had been about.
In the greatest speech ever

00:27:46.003 --> 00:27:48.759
delivered by an American
president--I would venture that;

00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:50.930
we could get up a debate on
that I'm sure.

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:54.640
But what are you going to put
up against the Second Inaugural

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.597
for an economy of language and a
music of words and an honesty of

00:27:58.597 --> 00:28:00.769
meaning?
Read the Second Inaugural;

00:28:00.769 --> 00:28:02.450
it only takes about three
minutes.

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:09.920
He's been re-elected.
This is March '65.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.260
The war is almost over;
not there yet.

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:17.299
What does he say in that speech?
What had it been about?

00:28:17.299 --> 00:28:20.110
How does he explain all the
death?

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:25.667
He doesn't find that easy.
But in the second paragraph,

00:28:25.667 --> 00:28:29.769
and the third paragraph,
came a few phrases that we've

00:28:29.769 --> 00:28:34.103
been trying to answer through
interpretation in our 65 to

00:28:34.103 --> 00:28:38.747
70,000 books on the Civil War,
more than one a day that we've

00:28:38.747 --> 00:28:43.096
written ever since.
He's thinking back to his First

00:28:43.096 --> 00:28:47.089
Inaugural and he says,
"Both parties deprecated war,

00:28:47.089 --> 00:28:52.649
but one of them would make war
rather than let the nation

00:28:52.649 --> 00:28:58.308
survive, and the other would
accept war rather than let it

00:28:58.308 --> 00:29:01.710
perish."
That's his interpretation;

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.448
of course, he's going to get
vast disagreement on that from

00:29:04.448 --> 00:29:08.390
Southerners.
And then the famous phrase,

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:12.323
"And the war came."
There are more titles of books

00:29:12.323 --> 00:29:15.429
on the Civil War taken from this
speech than anything else ever

00:29:15.429 --> 00:29:16.432
done.
When in doubt,

00:29:16.432 --> 00:29:18.887
people just go to Lincoln's
Second Inaugural and find some

00:29:18.887 --> 00:29:20.811
little phrase,
if they can find three words

00:29:20.811 --> 00:29:23.236
somebody else hasn't used
before, and it becomes the title

00:29:23.236 --> 00:29:26.302
of their book.
Kenneth Stamp used And the

00:29:26.302 --> 00:29:29.130
War Came,
a book on secession.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:32.024
Jim McPherson has a new book of
essays out, it's called

00:29:32.024 --> 00:29:35.240
Mighty Scourge of War;
it comes out of here.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.947
Stephen Oates' biography of
Abraham Lincoln,

00:29:37.947 --> 00:29:41.910
Malice Toward None.
I mean, it's just endless.

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:46.437
But then in that next
paragraph, "One-eighth of the

00:29:46.437 --> 00:29:50.059
whole population were colored
slaves."

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:53.875
Three weeks ago when Barack
Obama used the word "slave,"

00:29:53.875 --> 00:29:58.219
"slavery," or "slaves,"
seven times in that remarkable

00:29:58.219 --> 00:30:03.524
speech, it's remarkable because
it's been altogether rare that

00:30:03.524 --> 00:30:08.568
presidents or presidential
candidates have ever mouthed the

00:30:08.568 --> 00:30:12.830
word "slave" in American
political rhetoric.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:18.027
But Lincoln did.
"One-eighth of the whole

00:30:18.027 --> 00:30:21.908
population were colored slaves,
not distributed generally over

00:30:21.908 --> 00:30:25.090
the Union, but localized in the
southern part."

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:28.950
No kidding.
And here it is.

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:35.260
"These slaves constituted a
peculiar and powerful interest."

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:39.490
Whoa.
"All knew," says Lincoln,

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:45.539
"that this interest was somehow
the cause of the war."

00:30:45.539 --> 00:30:51.359
Somehow; that's the greatest
somehow in American letters.

00:30:51.359 --> 00:30:56.326
We've been trying to explain
the somehow ever since,

00:30:56.326 --> 00:30:59.930
and we never can quite pin it
down.

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:03.334
And before that paragraph's
over you'd been treated to some

00:31:03.334 --> 00:31:05.859
of the most beautiful rhetoric
ever written,

00:31:05.859 --> 00:31:08.089
at least by an American
president.

00:31:08.089 --> 00:31:11.794
He says that everybody wished
for a result less fundamental

00:31:11.794 --> 00:31:15.497
and astounding.
We don't want all this

00:31:15.497 --> 00:31:19.779
revolution, but that's what we
got.

00:31:19.779 --> 00:31:25.509
And then comes that line,
"for every drop of blood shed

00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:30.390
by the lash, it shall be paid by
the sword."

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:34.086
You can't hear it or read it
and not know what the war had

00:31:34.086 --> 00:31:34.930
been about.

00:31:39.799 --> 00:31:44.798
Now, we're going to deal in the
next several lectures about the

00:31:44.798 --> 00:31:49.474
extended question of results of
this war, the consequences,

00:31:49.474 --> 00:31:53.435
short and long-term.
And there are many things we

00:31:53.435 --> 00:31:56.329
can put on that list,
to say the least.

00:31:56.329 --> 00:31:58.536
And let me just give you a
short list to begin with,

00:31:58.536 --> 00:32:00.700
and we're going to come back to
so much of this.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:08.519
A quick list.
Just keep it handy.

00:32:08.519 --> 00:32:12.192
And some of them are actually
signaled in that Second

00:32:12.192 --> 00:32:16.743
Inaugural.
I mean, one is that secession

00:32:16.743 --> 00:32:21.921
was killed, almost forever.
Now and then you hear about the

00:32:21.921 --> 00:32:25.019
Upper Peninsula of Michigan
wanting to secede or something;

00:32:25.019 --> 00:32:29.317
Texas once in awhile gets back
on its heels and says "don't

00:32:29.317 --> 00:32:33.170
mess with Texas" and says
they're going to secede,

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:35.930
and some parts of the country
say "go ahead."

00:32:40.569 --> 00:32:43.867
There's a fundamental change in
the nature of American

00:32:43.867 --> 00:32:46.792
nationalism and the
centralization of government

00:32:46.792 --> 00:32:48.970
that will come out of this war.

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:59.026
Eleven of the first twelve
amendments to the U.S.

00:32:59.026 --> 00:33:03.270
Constitution had been written
to limit national power.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:07.111
This is just fundamental.
It's one of Lincoln's less

00:33:07.111 --> 00:33:09.509
fundamental and astounding
results.

00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:13.063
Six of the next seven
constitutional amendments will

00:33:13.063 --> 00:33:15.849
be directly to increase federal
power;

00:33:15.849 --> 00:33:20.359
more on that as we do
Reconstruction.

00:33:20.359 --> 00:33:24.046
Power itself will shift from
south to north,

00:33:24.046 --> 00:33:28.589
at least for awhile,
in American political culture.

00:33:28.589 --> 00:33:34.441
Nativism will be put on the
run, at least for awhile,

00:33:34.441 --> 00:33:38.313
quite awhile.
The old Nativist Party and all

00:33:38.313 --> 00:33:42.463
that nativism of antebellum
America, what are you going to

00:33:42.463 --> 00:33:46.539
do with all that xenophobic
nativism in the wake of a war

00:33:46.539 --> 00:33:50.980
where one of every four Union
soldiers was foreign born?

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:53.371
And now they're U.S.
citizens claiming pensions on

00:33:53.371 --> 00:33:54.981
the U.S.
Government for saving the

00:33:54.981 --> 00:33:57.039
Union;
thank you very much.

00:33:57.039 --> 00:34:01.510
What Nativist party is going to
get any traction with Union

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:04.640
veterans in the 1870s?
None.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.379
The Labor Movement and the
Women's Rights Movements,

00:34:09.379 --> 00:34:13.747
on the other hand,
are going to be crippled--not

00:34:13.747 --> 00:34:17.299
ruined,
but crippled--by the Civil War,

00:34:17.299 --> 00:34:21.870
by the authoritarianism of war,
all its centralization.

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:28.705
And emancipation,
of course, ushered into

00:34:28.705 --> 00:34:32.659
national life all sorts of new
challenges,

00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:38.321
new ideas, new meanings,
and this most difficult

00:34:38.321 --> 00:34:43.139
American idea of all,
racial equality.

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:45.190
God, what are you going to do
with that now?

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:49.040
It's been taken out of
its--it's been unshucked from

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.550
its shell, by war.

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:58.368
Oh, there'll be a thousand
meanings, and we'll come back to

00:34:58.368 --> 00:35:03.262
six or seven of them.
Now, I want to introduce

00:35:03.262 --> 00:35:09.793
Reconstruction plans here in
just one moment,

00:35:09.793 --> 00:35:15.880
but at this particular moment
in time,

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.824
of all the possible meanings
people had taken from this

00:35:18.824 --> 00:35:22.258
war--and of course they're very
different meanings if you're one

00:35:22.258 --> 00:35:25.530
of those white Georgians who had
to face Sherman's Army,

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:30.059
of if you're Kate Stone out in
Texas, or if you're a widow of

00:35:30.059 --> 00:35:34.590
your husband and four of your
sons who've died in the war.

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:39.424
I mean, there are many,
many, many different individual

00:35:39.424 --> 00:35:41.936
stories.
But think back to what Lincoln

00:35:41.936 --> 00:35:45.115
had just said in the Second
Inaugural about what the war had

00:35:45.115 --> 00:35:48.815
been about,
and this chastening that it had

00:35:48.815 --> 00:35:53.128
brought the country.
One of the most remarkable

00:35:53.128 --> 00:35:58.301
documents left from this massive
documentation of this war,

00:35:58.301 --> 00:36:01.780
and of emancipation,
is this letter.

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:06.114
Perhaps you've seen it before,
it's getting reprinted now and

00:36:06.114 --> 00:36:09.256
then.
It's a letter written by a

00:36:09.256 --> 00:36:13.820
former slave whose name was
Jordan Anderson.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.530
How many of you've read Jordan
Anderson's letter before?

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:20.141
Good, the grad students have,
better have,

00:36:20.141 --> 00:36:22.915
yes.
Well, this is in the summer of

00:36:22.915 --> 00:36:27.059
'65.
What had the war meant?

00:36:27.059 --> 00:36:31.640
Jordan Anderson had been a
slave in Tennessee.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:35.050
He's living in Ohio now.
The war's over.

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:40.824
He gets a letter from his old
master, whose name was Colonel

00:36:40.824 --> 00:36:42.389
P.H.
Anderson.

00:36:42.389 --> 00:36:44.170
And Jordan's living in Dayton,
Ohio.

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:47.179
And he writes back,
to Colonel Anderson.

00:36:47.179 --> 00:36:48.880
He says, "Thank you very much
for your letter."

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:55.330
Anderson wants him to come back.
"Dear Sir, I got your letter,

00:36:55.330 --> 00:37:00.300
and was glad to find you had
not forgotten old Jordan,

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:04.043
and that you wanted me to come
back and live with you again,

00:37:04.043 --> 00:37:07.469
promising to do better for me
than anybody else can.

00:37:07.469 --> 00:37:11.380
I have often felt uneasy about
you.

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:15.212
I thought the Yankees would've
hung you long before this for

00:37:15.212 --> 00:37:17.940
harboring Rebs they found at
your house.

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:21.017
I suppose they never heard
about you going to Colonel

00:37:21.017 --> 00:37:24.212
Martin's to kill the Union
soldier that was left by his

00:37:24.212 --> 00:37:27.830
company in their stable.
Although you shot at me twice

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:31.075
before I left you,
I did not want to hear of your

00:37:31.075 --> 00:37:34.320
being hurt, and am glad you are
still living.

00:37:40.559 --> 00:37:43.997
It would do me good to go back
to the dear old home again,

00:37:43.997 --> 00:37:47.556
see Miss Mary and Miss Martha
and Allan and Esther and Green

00:37:47.556 --> 00:37:50.069
and Lee.
Give my love to them all,

00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:53.721
and tell them I hope we will
meet in a better world,

00:37:53.721 --> 00:37:56.942
if not in this.
I would've gone back to see you

00:37:56.942 --> 00:38:00.059
all when I was working in the
Nashville Hospital,

00:38:00.059 --> 00:38:04.898
but one of the neighbors told
me Henry intended to shoot me,

00:38:04.898 --> 00:38:08.724
if he ever got a chance.
I want to know particularly

00:38:08.724 --> 00:38:11.800
what the good chance is you
proposed to give me.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.817
I'm doing tolerably well here.
I get $25.00 a month with

00:38:15.817 --> 00:38:18.849
victuals and clothing,
have a comfortable home for

00:38:18.849 --> 00:38:22.814
Mandy"--that's his wife.
"The folks here call her Mrs.

00:38:22.814 --> 00:38:26.769
Anderson, and the children,
Millie Jane and Grundy,

00:38:26.769 --> 00:38:31.917
go to school and are learning.
The teacher says Grundy has a

00:38:31.917 --> 00:38:35.676
head to be a preacher.
They go to Sunday school,

00:38:35.676 --> 00:38:38.610
and Mandy and me attend church
regularly.

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:42.622
We are kindly treated.
Sometimes we overhear others

00:38:42.622 --> 00:38:46.920
saying, 'Them colored people
were slaves down in Tennessee.'

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.475
The children feel hurt when
they hear such remarks,

00:38:50.475 --> 00:38:54.813
but I will tell them it was no
disgrace in Tennessee to belong

00:38:54.813 --> 00:38:58.961
to Colonel Anderson.
Many darkies would have been

00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:03.059
proud, as I used to was,
to call you 'Master.'

00:39:03.059 --> 00:39:07.613
Now, if you will write and say
what wages you will give me,

00:39:07.613 --> 00:39:12.009
I will be better able to decide
whether it would be to my

00:39:12.009 --> 00:39:15.777
advantage to move back again.
As to my freedom,

00:39:15.777 --> 00:39:19.658
which you say I can have,
there's nothing to be gained on

00:39:19.658 --> 00:39:23.676
that score as I got my Free
Papers in 1864 from the Provost

00:39:23.676 --> 00:39:27.280
Marshal General of the
Department of Nashville.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:31.041
Mandy says she would be afraid
to go back without some proof

00:39:31.041 --> 00:39:34.420
that you are sincerely disposed
to treat us justly,

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:41.160
and we have concluded to test
your sincerity by asking you to

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:46.440
send us our wages for the time
we served you.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:50.891
This will make us forget,
and forgive old scores,

00:39:50.891 --> 00:39:54.600
and rely on your justice,
and friendship,

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:58.641
in the future.
I served you faithfully for

00:39:58.641 --> 00:40:02.329
thirty-two years,
and Mandy twenty years.

00:40:02.329 --> 00:40:08.077
At $25.00 a month for me,
and $2.00 a week for Mandy,

00:40:08.077 --> 00:40:12.719
our earnings would amount to
$11,680.00.

00:40:12.719 --> 00:40:17.467
Add to this the interest for
the time our wages has been kept

00:40:17.467 --> 00:40:21.899
back, and deduct what you paid
for our clothing and three

00:40:21.899 --> 00:40:26.409
doctors' visits for me and
pulling a tooth for Mandy,

00:40:26.409 --> 00:40:31.530
and the balance will show what
we are in justice entitled to.

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:34.796
Please send the money,
by Adam's Express,

00:40:34.796 --> 00:40:36.920
care of V.
Winters Esquire,

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:40.860
Dayton, Ohio."
He goes on another paragraph,

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:45.205
and then there's a P.S.
"Say howdy to George Carter,

00:40:45.205 --> 00:40:50.061
and thank him for taking the
pistol from you when you were

00:40:50.061 --> 00:40:53.190
shooting at me."
What did freedom mean?

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:57.251
What had the war meant?
Wages, with interest,

00:40:57.251 --> 00:41:04.627
according to Jordan Anderson.
Well, we'll see whether the

00:41:04.627 --> 00:41:10.380
United States would help out old
Jordan.

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:14.881
All right, now Reconstruction
is, of course,

00:41:14.881 --> 00:41:20.534
that ten or eleven year period
of American history that

00:41:20.534 --> 00:41:24.664
sometimes,
too often--I don't know how it

00:41:24.664 --> 00:41:29.283
was taught to you-- but
sometimes, too often we skirt

00:41:29.283 --> 00:41:31.407
through.
It's complicated,

00:41:31.407 --> 00:41:35.389
not as much glory to go around
as there is during the war.

00:41:35.389 --> 00:41:38.894
It's fraught with some
skullduggery and corruption on

00:41:38.894 --> 00:41:42.130
an unprecedented scale,
on all kinds of sides.

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:47.672
It's a time of enormous
imagination and experimentation,

00:41:47.672 --> 00:41:52.433
in politics and law.
It's also the time in American

00:41:52.433 --> 00:41:57.181
history when we have by far our
largest level of domestic

00:41:57.181 --> 00:42:02.267
terrorism and violence--a good
deal more on that in the weeks

00:42:02.267 --> 00:42:05.533
to come.
But Reconstruction policy,

00:42:05.533 --> 00:42:08.280
of course, began during the
war.

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:12.340
The debates over Reconstruction
policy began during the war.

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:44.849
Well sorry, I had Herman
Melville's poem here but what

00:42:44.849 --> 00:42:47.889
did I do with Herman Melville?
Forgive me.

00:42:47.889 --> 00:42:49.740
"Check that," as the old sports
announcer used to say.

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:56.565
The policies on Reconstruction
took two paths,

00:42:56.565 --> 00:43:00.199
and those paths begin as early
as late 1863,

00:43:00.199 --> 00:43:05.257
and they are especially being
debated in the federal

00:43:05.257 --> 00:43:10.216
government in 1864,
and they are ripe by the end of

00:43:10.216 --> 00:43:14.277
the war in 1865.
Lincoln's basic approach to

00:43:14.277 --> 00:43:17.741
Reconstruction,
when and if they could end the

00:43:17.741 --> 00:43:20.457
war,
win the war and stop it,

00:43:20.457 --> 00:43:24.630
was to make Reconstruction as
fast as possible,

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:28.531
as lenient as
possible--remember these three

00:43:28.531 --> 00:43:30.990
things,
you're going to hear it

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:34.090
again--as fast as possible,
as lenient as possible,

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:39.429
and as much as possible under
presidential authority,

00:43:39.429 --> 00:43:43.000
not Congress.
He's going to fashion this

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.530
so-called Ten Percent Plan,
which I'll explain next time,

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:51.907
but it in essence meant that he
wanted ten percent of the white

00:43:51.907 --> 00:43:55.861
voting population of a former
Confederate state to take a

00:43:55.861 --> 00:44:00.012
loyalty oath to the Union,
to redraw a new constitution,

00:44:00.012 --> 00:44:02.744
denounce secession,
accept emancipation,

00:44:02.744 --> 00:44:06.878
and they would be readmitted to
the Union under presidential

00:44:06.878 --> 00:44:09.616
authority.
And he wanted to do as much of

00:44:09.616 --> 00:44:12.819
it as possible during the war
because when the war ends he

00:44:12.819 --> 00:44:15.180
could lose his presidential war
powers.

00:44:18.469 --> 00:44:20.291
In Congress,
in his own party,

00:44:20.291 --> 00:44:24.121
led by Thaddeus Stevens in the
House and Charles Sumner in the

00:44:24.121 --> 00:44:28.015
Senate--and you'll learn a good
deal more about that in the two

00:44:28.015 --> 00:44:31.155
weeks to come--there's a very
different approach to

00:44:31.155 --> 00:44:35.451
Reconstruction.
The Congressional Radicals,

00:44:35.451 --> 00:44:39.359
as they become known,
Republicans all,

00:44:39.359 --> 00:44:44.112
want a Reconstruction that is
longer, harsher,

00:44:44.112 --> 00:44:48.019
and under Congressional
control.

00:44:48.019 --> 00:44:53.214
Now Lincoln won't be around,
of course, to engage in this

00:44:53.214 --> 00:44:57.969
battle after the war is over,
but he was there during the

00:44:57.969 --> 00:45:01.451
war, and they had quite a tussle
over imagining how

00:45:01.451 --> 00:45:03.610
Reconstruction would happen.

00:45:06.989 --> 00:45:10.160
Now if you want to get a sense
of Lincoln's approach to

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.508
Reconstruction,
now you can read the last

00:45:12.508 --> 00:45:15.561
paragraph of the Second
Inaugural about malice toward

00:45:15.561 --> 00:45:18.967
none and charity for all and
binding up the nation's wound,

00:45:18.967 --> 00:45:22.072
and so forth.
But there's also the statement

00:45:22.072 --> 00:45:25.756
he made in his last cabinet
meeting, the last meeting he had

00:45:25.756 --> 00:45:28.045
of his cabinet,
before he went to Ford's

00:45:28.045 --> 00:45:31.567
Theater, literally that night.
He said to his cabinet,

00:45:31.567 --> 00:45:35.513
and I'm quoting:
"I hope that there will be no

00:45:35.513 --> 00:45:39.372
persecutions,
no bloody work after the war is

00:45:39.372 --> 00:45:42.521
over.
No one need expect me to take

00:45:42.521 --> 00:45:47.063
any part in hanging or killing
these men, even the worst of

00:45:47.063 --> 00:45:49.397
them.
Frighten them out of the

00:45:49.397 --> 00:45:52.384
country, open the gates,
let down the bars,

00:45:52.384 --> 00:45:55.300
scare them off,
but enough lives have been

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:58.230
sacrificed."
That's one approach,

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:03.649
but that is not the approach of
the leaders of the Congressional

00:46:03.649 --> 00:46:06.861
Republicans,
some of whom would've wished

00:46:06.861 --> 00:46:10.429
for there to be some treason
trials and executions,

00:46:10.429 --> 00:46:14.984
but short of that they want a
Reconstruction that's going to

00:46:14.984 --> 00:46:19.765
reshape the American polity,
rewrite the U.S.

00:46:19.765 --> 00:46:26.389
Constitution,
and remake Southern society.

00:46:26.389 --> 00:46:29.659
Anyone I ever run into who says
"Reconstruction's too

00:46:29.659 --> 00:46:31.860
complicated and not
interesting,"

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:35.469
I don't understand it,
because how can you have that

00:46:35.469 --> 00:46:39.150
kind of thing happening and it
not be interesting?

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:46.210
But I found Melville, sorry.
Let me leave you with this.

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:51.402
Spare the poets.
Melville wrote this little

00:46:51.402 --> 00:46:54.100
poem, after Lincoln was
murdered.

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:55.250
Listen to what he says.

00:47:00.099 --> 00:47:03.938
"Good Friday was the day Of the
prodigy and crime,

00:47:03.938 --> 00:47:06.679
When they killed him in his
pity,

00:47:06.679 --> 00:47:12.174
When they killed him in his
prime Of clemency and calm--When

00:47:12.174 --> 00:47:17.390
with yearning he was filled To
redeem the evil-willed,

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:23.275
And, though conqueror, be kind;
But they killed him in his

00:47:23.275 --> 00:47:26.435
kindness, In their madness and
their blindness,

00:47:26.435 --> 00:47:28.840
And they killed him from
behind.

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:33.929
There is sobbing of the strong,
And a pall upon the land;

00:47:33.929 --> 00:47:38.659
But the People in their weeping
Bare an iron hand;

00:47:38.659 --> 00:47:43.289
Beware the People weeping When
they bare the iron hand.

00:47:43.289 --> 00:47:46.840
He lieth in his blood--the
father in his face;

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:50.887
They have killed him,
the Forgiver--The Avenger now

00:47:50.887 --> 00:47:54.449
takes his place,
The Avenger wisely stern,

00:47:54.449 --> 00:47:58.334
Who in righteousness shall do
What the heavens call him to,

00:47:58.334 --> 00:48:02.047
And the parricides remand;
For they killed him in his

00:48:02.047 --> 00:48:05.297
kindness, In their madness and
their blindness,

00:48:05.297 --> 00:48:10.745
And his blood is on their hand.
There is sobbing of the strong,

00:48:10.745 --> 00:48:16.010
And a pall upon the land;
But the People in their weeping

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:20.476
Bare the iron hand;
Beware the People weeping When

00:48:20.476 --> 00:48:24.498
they bare an iron hand."
The whole history of

00:48:24.498 --> 00:48:30.037
Reconstruction has always been a
debate really over how iron the

00:48:30.037 --> 00:48:35.000
hand should've been.
Thank you, see you next week.

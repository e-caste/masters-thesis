00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.716
Professor John Rogers:
We've looked at Milton's

00:00:04.716 --> 00:00:06.783
earliest poem,
or what Milton wants us to

00:00:06.783 --> 00:00:09.677
think of as his earliest poem,
from a couple of different

00:00:09.677 --> 00:00:13.337
perspectives.
So you remember our examination

00:00:13.337 --> 00:00:18.259
on Monday of the Nativity Ode,
which I took to be an early

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.800
poetic achievement in Milton's
career,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.479
and which Milton himself took
to be an early poetic

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:27.739
achievement in his career;
but we also looked at the

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.032
Nativity Ode as a poem or
a kind of statement about the

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:35.270
very nature of an early poetic
achievement,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.947
and about Milton's sense of the
nature of a poetic career in

00:00:40.947 --> 00:00:44.093
general.
And I think this can be said:

00:00:44.093 --> 00:00:48.160
this is true of a number of
Milton's earliest lyrics.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.034
The early poems are not merely
brilliant literary exercises in

00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:56.630
and of themselves,
although of course they are

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.366
that.
The early lyrics are also

00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:02.592
instances, moments,
in Milton's life-long

00:01:02.592 --> 00:01:05.900
meditation on what it is to be a
poet.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.377
And I think it's fair to say
that Milton's

00:01:08.377 --> 00:01:12.123
reconceptualization of the role
of the poet permanently altered

00:01:12.123 --> 00:01:14.480
the way in which later
generations,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.200
especially later generations of
writers and poets,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.452
would imagine the work of
poetry and imagine the power of

00:01:22.452 --> 00:01:25.687
the poet.
In this respect Milton's

00:01:25.687 --> 00:01:31.023
contribution to the Western
literary imagination is really

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:35.892
unparalleled.Milton
represented himself as a poet

00:01:35.892 --> 00:01:41.416
more often and with more care
and attention than any English

00:01:41.416 --> 00:01:45.777
poet before him.
And in fact it often strikes us

00:01:45.777 --> 00:01:49.979
that Milton's poetry seems so
absolutely new and so original

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.970
because he's really the first
poet who,

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.046
in a number of ways,
in a number of different

00:01:56.046 --> 00:01:59.541
registers, seems often to be
doing little more than

00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:02.744
describing himself,
justifying himself,

00:02:02.744 --> 00:02:07.211
or accounting for himself.
And it's this procedure of

00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:12.122
self-accounting that I want to
focus on today as we look at

00:02:12.122 --> 00:02:17.202
Milton's amazing sense of his
vocation as a poet and Milton's

00:02:17.202 --> 00:02:22.283
sense of poetry-writing as an
example of what he calls in one

00:02:22.283 --> 00:02:27.617
context an example of "credible
employment."Now Milton never

00:02:27.617 --> 00:02:33.222
writes a formal autobiography.
But Milton's body of poetry and

00:02:33.222 --> 00:02:37.604
his substantial body of prose,
most of it polemical prose --

00:02:37.604 --> 00:02:41.169
this stuff is littered with what
are clearly,

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:44.377
recognizably,
and explicitly autobiographical

00:02:44.377 --> 00:02:47.622
passages;
and the degree to which you

00:02:47.622 --> 00:02:52.960
find yourself having some sort
of affinity with this poet,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.195
with Milton,
will probably correspond to the

00:02:56.195 --> 00:03:00.408
degree to which you find
yourself enjoying or having some

00:03:00.408 --> 00:03:03.719
kind of tolerance for Milton's
propensity for

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:07.180
self-representation and
self-accounting.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.971
I think one of the most
striking experiences of reading

00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:12.969
Milton's prose works -- and
they're typically polemical,

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:17.788
political tracts in nature --
is the recognition of this

00:03:17.788 --> 00:03:21.379
writer's willingness to insert
himself,

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.848
to insinuate his own private
meditations and

00:03:24.848 --> 00:03:28.559
self-reflections,
into the otherwise public and

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:32.189
often political concerns of the
treatise.

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:37.067
So Milton will continually be
saying in his prose tracts,

00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:38.750
"Oh!
I just had an idea.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.865
Dear reader,
before I go on,

00:03:40.865 --> 00:03:44.470
perhaps I should say something
about myself.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.060
I need to explain something to
you about where I'm coming from.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.750
You wonder who I am to tell you
this?

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.494
Let me give you an account of
myself and let me establish the

00:03:54.494 --> 00:03:57.988
reasons why you need to go on
listening to me and why you

00:03:57.988 --> 00:04:01.358
should believe my position on
this or that political or

00:04:01.358 --> 00:04:04.602
ecclesiastical topic."It's
this drive to constant

00:04:04.602 --> 00:04:08.159
self-definition that becomes the
characteristic feature of

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.030
Milton's work for later
generations.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.704
The Romantic poets like Blake
and Wordsworth and Shelley and

00:04:14.704 --> 00:04:18.564
Keats in the nineteenth century
are continually looking back to

00:04:18.564 --> 00:04:22.147
just those moments in Milton,
Milton's method of

00:04:22.147 --> 00:04:26.219
self-justification and
surprising self-assertion,

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:30.292
because it was precisely in
Milton's exercises in

00:04:30.292 --> 00:04:35.213
autobiographical writing that a
crucial element of literary

00:04:35.213 --> 00:04:39.880
practice gets established:
and that's the element of the

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.649
poet's meditation on the meaning
of his vocation as a poet.

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:53.419
Milton is magnificently free of
the pressures of modesty and

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.474
reticence.
And that freedom,

00:04:56.474 --> 00:05:01.330
the liberation from that
burden, also becomes an enormous

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.100
part of his appeal for later
generations of writers.

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:17.956
It's just a fact that Milton is
shockingly unembarrassed about

00:05:17.956 --> 00:05:22.379
making public all of his highest
literary ambitions.

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:24.846
There's every indication that
Milton believed,

00:05:24.846 --> 00:05:27.971
as I had mentioned before,
at an unconscionably early age,

00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:32.992
that poetry was his vocation.
And he's continually willing to

00:05:32.992 --> 00:05:38.588
make that belief a public
one.By "vocation" I'm not

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:43.092
merely thinking of a job,
although certainly the modern

00:05:43.092 --> 00:05:46.242
sense of vocation as a form of
employment is certainly one

00:05:46.242 --> 00:05:49.226
that's available to Milton and
certainly present in his

00:05:49.226 --> 00:05:53.117
thinking about the vocation;
but I also mean vocation

00:05:53.117 --> 00:05:56.319
in its earlier,
more etymologically pure sense,

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:00.187
the literal sense of the word:
vocation as a calling,

00:06:00.187 --> 00:06:04.488
from the Latin vocare.
One's vocation is that to which

00:06:04.488 --> 00:06:09.100
one has been called -- called
presumably by God -- to perform.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.680
So you have two rather
competing senses of the word

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.688
"vocation" here,
vocation as employment and

00:06:15.688 --> 00:06:19.084
vocation as a calling,
and they're constantly for

00:06:19.084 --> 00:06:22.387
Milton bleeding into one
another, these two senses of the

00:06:22.387 --> 00:06:24.433
word,
and often struggling with one

00:06:24.433 --> 00:06:26.550
another or competing with one
another.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.029
Milton was always wrestling
with the problem of vocation in

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:33.134
all of its meanings,
and the problem of what a

00:06:33.134 --> 00:06:37.631
calling actually is and how one
actually knows one has a calling

00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:41.556
is a problem that pulsates
somewhere beneath most of the

00:06:41.556 --> 00:06:45.696
lines of poetry that Milton
writes.The most stunning of

00:06:45.696 --> 00:06:50.050
all of the anticipatory career
narratives that I had mentioned

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.261
in the last class appears in the
passage of The Reason of

00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:58.329
Church Government that you
read for today,

00:06:58.329 --> 00:07:04.292
so I'm going to ask you to turn
to your Hughes editions and look

00:07:04.292 --> 00:07:08.930
at the top of the left-hand
column of page 668.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.975
This is where Milton describes
the outpouring of enthusiasm

00:07:12.975 --> 00:07:16.811
that he received for his poetry
from a number of learned

00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:20.160
Italians during his recent
travels to Italy.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.840
This is the top of the
left-hand column on 668.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.459
Milton: 
…I began thus far

00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:30.309
to assent both to them and
divers of my friends here at

00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:32.731
home,
and not less to an inward

00:07:32.731 --> 00:07:37.173
prompting which now grew daily
upon me, [and think about this

00:07:37.173 --> 00:07:40.653
inward prompting:
is it the self's own prompting

00:07:40.653 --> 00:07:44.430
or is this a prompting
experienced internally,

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.092
a prompting of God,
a vocation?]

00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:52.245
that by labor and intent study
(which I take to be my portion

00:07:52.245 --> 00:07:57.569
in this life) joined with the
strong propensity of nature,

00:07:57.569 --> 00:08:00.626
[I agreed with all of these
voices that]

00:08:00.626 --> 00:08:05.250
I might perhaps leave something
so written to aftertimes,

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.600
as they should not willingly
let it die.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.801
Now it's clear here that Milton
is imagining this future work,

00:08:11.801 --> 00:08:14.740
the work that "aftertimes will
not willingly let die,"

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.029
as the fulfillment of a
professional career.

00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:23.069
We certainly don't here have an
image of a poet whose poetry is

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:28.027
being written effortlessly or
easily as the young Milton seems

00:08:28.027 --> 00:08:32.659
convinced that Shakespeare's
poetry had been written.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:36.642
In "L'Allegro" and in
"Il Penseroso," which you'll be

00:08:36.642 --> 00:08:39.679
reading soon--or especially in
"L'Allegro,"

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:42.877
 Milton is able to say
that Shakespeare simply "warble

00:08:42.877 --> 00:08:45.200
his…
Wood-notes wild."

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.412
He was able to produce all
those magnificent plays simply

00:08:49.412 --> 00:08:54.000
by instinct: a kind of natural
urge produced and generated all

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.529
of that poetry.
But Milton portrays himself as

00:08:57.529 --> 00:09:00.750
a laborer here,
a poet who by labor and intense

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.669
study actually has to work to
produce the great poem.

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:07.867
Milton's divine vocation,
his calling,

00:09:07.867 --> 00:09:12.793
seems in this light to be
something like a vocation in the

00:09:12.793 --> 00:09:16.509
modern sense:
it's a job that exacts work or

00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:21.089
labor.Now look at page 671
again on the top of the

00:09:21.089 --> 00:09:25.764
left-hand column.
Here Milton is elaborating on

00:09:25.764 --> 00:09:30.360
the details of his anticipation
of his undying fame.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.253
This is a polemical tract about
a new way in which the Anglican

00:09:35.253 --> 00:09:38.409
church government should be
organized.

00:09:38.409 --> 00:09:43.370
What in the hell is all of this
doing here?

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:48.762
Milton's reporting to the
English people how he imagines

00:09:48.762 --> 00:09:53.574
his future literary fame.
It's extraordinarily and

00:09:53.574 --> 00:09:57.937
wonderfully inappropriate.
Milton's not making just any

00:09:57.937 --> 00:10:01.518
idle suggestion that he will
write a poem that future

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:05.649
generations will find themselves
incapable of forgetting.

00:10:05.649 --> 00:10:07.990
This is the left-hand column on
671:

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.761
Neither do I think it
shame to covenant with any

00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:14.893
knowing reader,
that for some few years yet I

00:10:14.893 --> 00:10:19.092
may go on trust with him toward
the payment of what I am now

00:10:19.092 --> 00:10:21.770
indebted,
as being a work not to be

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.250
raised from the heat of youth,
or the vapors of wine,

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:29.040
like that which flows at waste
from the pen of some vulgar

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.900
amorist, or the trencher of fury
of a riming

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.204
parasite…
Out of nowhere you get this

00:10:35.204 --> 00:10:38.760
sense of anger on Milton's part
and this kind of contempt that

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.674
he feels and he will feel for
the rest of his life:

00:10:41.674 --> 00:10:44.240
his contempt of his poetic
competitors,

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.852
his contemporary poets -- all
of whom are vulgarians in this

00:10:49.852 --> 00:10:52.876
characterization.
…nor to be

00:10:52.876 --> 00:10:55.732
obtained by the invocation of
Dame Memory and her Siren

00:10:55.732 --> 00:10:58.364
daughters,
[these are all forms of poetic

00:10:58.364 --> 00:11:01.993
inspiration that Milton is
declaring he is rejecting here

00:11:01.993 --> 00:11:04.983
-- Milton's work,
the great work will emerge

00:11:04.983 --> 00:11:07.720
instead from]
…devout prayer to that

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.042
eternal spirit who can enrich
with all utterance and

00:11:11.042 --> 00:11:14.468
knowledge,
and sends out his seraphim with

00:11:14.468 --> 00:11:19.365
the hallowed fire of his altar,
to touch and purify the lips of

00:11:19.365 --> 00:11:23.759
whom he pleases.
It's an amazing passage.

00:11:23.759 --> 00:11:26.915
You have at the end of this
sentence that same -- and you'll

00:11:26.915 --> 00:11:30.177
remember this -- that same image
of prophetic preparation with

00:11:30.177 --> 00:11:32.529
which Milton had begun the
Nativity Ode,

00:11:32.529 --> 00:11:36.365
but you'll remember that line,
"from out his secret Altar

00:11:36.365 --> 00:11:40.240
touched with hallow'd fire."
Like the old Hebrew prophet

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.487
Isaiah, Milton will be inspired
to write his great work when the

00:11:44.487 --> 00:11:49.454
iniquity of his lips is purged,
when the eternal spirit touches

00:11:49.454 --> 00:11:54.200
with hallowed fire the lips
of whom he pleases.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.274
Milton is going to be a great
poet because it has pleased God

00:11:57.274 --> 00:12:00.284
to have chosen him,
because God has called Milton

00:12:00.284 --> 00:12:03.952
to serve as a human conduit for
the conveyance of divine

00:12:03.952 --> 00:12:06.003
knowledge;
and so according to this

00:12:06.003 --> 00:12:08.814
concluding image here of this
sentence, Milton's imagining

00:12:08.814 --> 00:12:11.625
himself more or less in the
traditional image of the great

00:12:11.625 --> 00:12:15.123
biblical prophets,
the passive vehicle through

00:12:15.123 --> 00:12:20.200
which the Deity transmits His
awe-inspiring message.But

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:25.714
this pious subservience that you
have ending this passage -- and

00:12:25.714 --> 00:12:31.054
certainly it's consonant with
that image from the Nativity Ode

00:12:31.054 --> 00:12:34.545
-- nonetheless,
I think it's safe to say that

00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:37.784
it comes as quite a shock when
you consider the sentence as a

00:12:37.784 --> 00:12:40.118
whole.
Milton had begun the sentence

00:12:40.118 --> 00:12:42.859
not with calm,
prophetic certainty about his

00:12:42.859 --> 00:12:45.692
divine vocation.
He began it with a far more

00:12:45.692 --> 00:12:48.877
secular set of images,
a set of images that comes from

00:12:48.877 --> 00:12:52.330
the world of business.
It's a set of images that

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:57.168
couldn't be more foreign or more
alien to the prophetic mode of

00:12:57.168 --> 00:13:01.679
the Old Testament prophets.
Milton begins by saying that he

00:13:01.679 --> 00:13:05.669
was going to write a great work
because he's "indebted,"

00:13:05.669 --> 00:13:09.517
because he owes the
English people something after

00:13:09.517 --> 00:13:13.158
all of their patient waiting:
" do I think it shame to

00:13:13.158 --> 00:13:15.700
covenant with any knowing
reader,

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.208
that for some few years yet I
may go on trust with him toward

00:13:20.208 --> 00:13:23.289
the payment of what I am now
indebted."

00:13:23.289 --> 00:13:27.040
And according to this image of
the vocation of the poet,

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.450
Milton isn't claiming divine
inspiration at all.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:35.070
He's making a deal.Milton
makes a covenant with the

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.547
reader.
It's as if he's signing a

00:13:37.547 --> 00:13:40.690
contract because he's asking for
credit here.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:45.302
"Please let me borrow…"
-- what on earth would the

00:13:45.302 --> 00:13:49.960
readers of this polemical tract
care about Milton's literary

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.941
future?
He's no one to them except a

00:13:52.941 --> 00:13:56.541
political polemicist,
but nonetheless this is a

00:13:56.541 --> 00:14:01.080
remarkable logic -- "Please give
me a little more time,

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:05.727
patient readers,
as I prepare to write the great

00:14:05.727 --> 00:14:09.244
English epic."
And like any shrewd borrower,

00:14:09.244 --> 00:14:13.446
Milton promises that the credit
extended will prove an excellent

00:14:13.446 --> 00:14:16.602
investment.
Milton will leave something "so

00:14:16.602 --> 00:14:20.186
written to aftertimes,
as they should not willingly

00:14:20.186 --> 00:14:23.913
let it die."So think about
this sentence with its

00:14:23.913 --> 00:14:28.429
combination of commercial
rhetoric and prophetic language,

00:14:28.429 --> 00:14:32.210
making explicit the competing
models really for the production

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:35.120
of the great poem.
So the first model is that the

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.513
poem will be the result of the
poet's labor,

00:14:37.513 --> 00:14:41.045
his hard work,
the expense of which will be

00:14:41.045 --> 00:14:45.446
assumed by the reader's credit.
That's the secular,

00:14:45.446 --> 00:14:48.607
the economic image.
And the second model is that

00:14:48.607 --> 00:14:52.293
the poem will be the consequence
of the poet's humble prayers to

00:14:52.293 --> 00:14:56.095
the eternal spirit,
a spirit who doesn't inspire

00:14:56.095 --> 00:15:01.215
the poet who works the hardest
but simply the poet whom it

00:15:01.215 --> 00:15:05.863
pleases the spirit to inspire.
And so in the sentence that

00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:09.478
we've just looked at at some
length now we have embodied in

00:15:09.478 --> 00:15:13.406
the form of a shifting argument
-- a really slippery argument --

00:15:13.406 --> 00:15:16.024
the two senses of the word
vocation:

00:15:16.024 --> 00:15:19.639
vocation as a job and vocation
as a divine calling.

00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:22.573
And I'd go so far to say that
most of the really,

00:15:22.573 --> 00:15:25.996
truly memorable moments in
Milton's poetry and prose have

00:15:25.996 --> 00:15:29.480
been generated by some version
of just this conflict.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.440
Milton's poetry is always
emerging from the gap between

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.326
the competing meanings of a
particularly important and

00:15:37.326 --> 00:15:41.653
weighty concept like that of
vocation.Now to some extent

00:15:41.653 --> 00:15:45.686
we shouldn't find ourselves
surprised that we see at the

00:15:45.686 --> 00:15:49.353
heart of Milton's statement
anticipating his future

00:15:49.353 --> 00:15:53.166
greatness something of a
contradiction concerning the

00:15:53.166 --> 00:15:58.112
idea of a vocation.
It's just this uncertain status

00:15:58.112 --> 00:16:02.680
of a whole raft of ideas
associated with vocation that

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:07.939
really fissured and fractured
the spiritual lives of countless

00:16:07.939 --> 00:16:12.925
seventeenth-century puritans.
Milton is inheriting here an

00:16:12.925 --> 00:16:16.889
enormously rich tradition of
thought on this subject.

00:16:16.889 --> 00:16:19.834
According to the
sixteenth-century Protestant

00:16:19.834 --> 00:16:22.980
theologian Jean Calvin -- a
Swiss theologian,

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:28.805
or actually French but he lives
in Geneva -- God chooses us,

00:16:28.805 --> 00:16:33.149
God elects us for salvation and
damnation.

00:16:33.149 --> 00:16:35.096
We ourselves,
of course, have no choice

00:16:35.096 --> 00:16:38.790
whatsoever in the matter.
And this belief that's called

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:42.695
Calvinist predestination is
really at the heart of

00:16:42.695 --> 00:16:46.440
mainstream English Puritanism at
this point.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.615
Our salvation is entirely in
God's hands.But it seemed to

00:16:50.615 --> 00:16:54.722
a lot of followers of Calvin
that it was a matter -- and you

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:58.549
can imagine why -- it was a
matter of some urgency and a

00:16:58.549 --> 00:17:02.516
matter of some importance to
know whether one had actually

00:17:02.516 --> 00:17:05.440
been elected by God for
salvation.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.072
We need some proof of our
salvation simply to get up in

00:17:09.072 --> 00:17:12.428
the morning actually,
when you think about it,

00:17:12.428 --> 00:17:16.646
and the only proof for so many
of Milton's contemporaries

00:17:16.646 --> 00:17:21.317
seemed to lay in the degree of
visible success that they seemed

00:17:21.317 --> 00:17:24.044
to have enjoyed.
And so then,

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:27.954
much as now,
one of the most obvious signs

00:17:27.954 --> 00:17:31.769
of success was,
of course, financial.

00:17:31.769 --> 00:17:36.532
The means by which we could
discern whether God had called

00:17:36.532 --> 00:17:41.628
on us to join the elect was by
discerning the profitability of

00:17:41.628 --> 00:17:46.140
our vocation -- vocation
in the secular sense of

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:51.070
employment -- and so you can
probably see something like the

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:56.083
strangely perverse logic that
could begin to attach itself to

00:17:56.083 --> 00:18:00.594
the puritan belief in God's
predestination of all human

00:18:00.594 --> 00:18:05.357
beings either to salvation or
damnation.It's generally

00:18:05.357 --> 00:18:11.539
understood that this is not at
all what Calvin had intended,

00:18:11.539 --> 00:18:13.896
but it's what happened
nonetheless: one felt that one

00:18:13.896 --> 00:18:16.904
had to prove to others,
and maybe more importantly to

00:18:16.904 --> 00:18:19.618
prove to oneself,
that one has already been

00:18:19.618 --> 00:18:22.729
predestined by God.
For salvation one has to be

00:18:22.729 --> 00:18:26.296
successful, and the only way to
assure one's success is to

00:18:26.296 --> 00:18:28.620
labor,
of course: to work hard,

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.729
to achieve through effort that
success which one secretly

00:18:32.729 --> 00:18:36.470
feared should already have been
achieved by means of

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:40.432
predestination.There's an
irrational inversion of cause

00:18:40.432 --> 00:18:44.347
and effect here,
and it's a magnificent paradox:

00:18:44.347 --> 00:18:47.509
God chooses us based on no work
of our own,

00:18:47.509 --> 00:18:50.675
but we find ourselves working
as hard as we possibly can in

00:18:50.675 --> 00:18:53.349
order to demonstrate to
ourselves that we have,

00:18:53.349 --> 00:18:57.769
in fact, already been
chosen.According to the

00:18:57.769 --> 00:19:03.570
German sociologist Max Weber --
the founder of the discipline of

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:09.187
sociology who pioneers the study
of the sociological impact of

00:19:09.187 --> 00:19:13.975
Protestant theology at the
beginning of the twentieth

00:19:13.975 --> 00:19:19.776
century -- it is precisely this
backwards and cruel logic that's

00:19:19.776 --> 00:19:25.670
responsible for what he -- and
it's an enormous claim,

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:29.351
essentially insupportable,
but it's this backwards,

00:19:29.351 --> 00:19:33.548
crazily inverted logic that's
responsible for the economic

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:37.303
progress of the northern
Europeans -- for what Weber

00:19:37.303 --> 00:19:41.500
calls the emergence of the
"Protestant work ethic."

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:47.182
So historians can and in fact
have many times taken issue with

00:19:47.182 --> 00:19:50.630
a lot of Weber's historical
claims.

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:53.699
But he's invaluable,
as the critic John Guillory has

00:19:53.699 --> 00:19:57.491
argued, for our purposes in the
understanding of Milton and of a

00:19:57.491 --> 00:20:00.922
lot of the cultural business of
the seventeenth century in

00:20:00.922 --> 00:20:04.774
general.The assumption among
a lot of reformation Protestants

00:20:04.774 --> 00:20:08.326
in Milton's day was that what
God commands above all else is

00:20:08.326 --> 00:20:10.533
our labor,
our investment,

00:20:10.533 --> 00:20:14.411
and God expects after our labor
and investment that we have

00:20:14.411 --> 00:20:18.557
something to show for it at the
end -- it makes sense - that we

00:20:18.557 --> 00:20:23.443
have in some way profited.
And so it's here at this

00:20:23.443 --> 00:20:30.829
intensely awkward point at which
Protestantism and capitalism,

00:20:30.829 --> 00:20:35.891
two seemingly disparate spheres
of activity and thought and

00:20:35.891 --> 00:20:40.690
being -- at this strange point
at which these two things

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:45.402
converge -- it's at this
intersection that we find John

00:20:45.402 --> 00:20:50.900
Milton.To understand the
concerns of Milton's poetry,

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:54.740
it is important to
understand this massive

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:59.380
conjunction of economic and
spiritual thought that's really

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.740
at the heart of English
Protestantism.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:03.869
But that's just a part of the
story.

00:21:03.869 --> 00:21:08.107
There's also a more specific,
a more local,

00:21:08.107 --> 00:21:13.657
reason for which our John
Milton was susceptible to this

00:21:13.657 --> 00:21:19.610
profit-and-loss rhetoric of
Calvinist puritan theology.

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:24.370
Milton was the son of a banker.
(Technically,

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.566
banks didn't exist at this
point in the seventeenth

00:21:26.566 --> 00:21:29.231
century.
It's not until the Dutch invent

00:21:29.231 --> 00:21:33.382
banks late in the seventeenth
century.) Milton is the son of

00:21:33.382 --> 00:21:36.829
what is the equivalent of a
modern-day banker.

00:21:36.829 --> 00:21:39.812
He's what would have been
called in the seventeenth

00:21:39.812 --> 00:21:42.019
century a scrivener or a
goldsmith.

00:21:42.019 --> 00:21:45.972
A goldsmith was an early money
lender, and it was a perfectly

00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:49.726
respectable profession as far as
bourgeois professions go,

00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:50.978
and John Milton,
Sr.

00:21:50.978 --> 00:21:55.316
has a pretty good living.
But in practice it's actually

00:21:55.316 --> 00:21:59.750
much more analogous to what a
modern-day pawnbroker does:

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:03.867
you would leave with John
Milton, Sr., the goldsmith,

00:22:03.867 --> 00:22:08.618
a portion of gold and on the
basis of that collateral -- this

00:22:08.618 --> 00:22:12.339
is all the business of
collateral loans,

00:22:12.339 --> 00:22:15.249
pawnbroking -- on the basis of
that collateral,

00:22:15.249 --> 00:22:16.198
John Milton,
Sr.

00:22:16.198 --> 00:22:19.741
would lend you a sum of money
for which you would pay him

00:22:19.741 --> 00:22:22.037
interest.
At the end of the loan upon

00:22:22.037 --> 00:22:24.881
your payment of the principal
and of sufficient additional

00:22:24.881 --> 00:22:26.351
interest,
John Milton,

00:22:26.351 --> 00:22:29.762
Sr., the goldsmith,
would return to you the gold

00:22:29.762 --> 00:22:32.666
that you had entrusted to
him.Now Mr.

00:22:32.666 --> 00:22:37.094
Milton took some risks when he
separated himself from his cash

00:22:37.094 --> 00:22:41.015
and lent money to his clients,
or lent more money to his

00:22:41.015 --> 00:22:43.930
clients than the collateral,
the gold, was actually worth.

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:47.509
And the motive for that risk,
of course, the motive for that

00:22:47.509 --> 00:22:50.299
investment, was the expectation
of a profit.

00:22:50.299 --> 00:22:55.486
It's just this economic pattern
of risky investment and the

00:22:55.486 --> 00:23:00.135
expectation of a profit that
forms something like the

00:23:00.135 --> 00:23:05.768
thematic paradigm of profit and
loss that really is at the heart

00:23:05.768 --> 00:23:11.670
of Milton's representation of
his future literary greatness,

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:14.609
his conception of himself as a
poet.

00:23:14.609 --> 00:23:19.561
Milton seems to have inherited
from his father a language of

00:23:19.561 --> 00:23:24.847
commerce, a language that he was
able so easily and effortlessly

00:23:24.847 --> 00:23:29.882
to transpose from his father's
vocation as a goldsmith to his

00:23:29.882 --> 00:23:34.917
own anticipated vocation as a
poet.Milton owes his father

00:23:34.917 --> 00:23:38.610
this whole lexical world of
lending,

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:43.173
of borrowing and of profit.
But also Milton owes his father

00:23:43.173 --> 00:23:45.649
more than that,
more than merely a set of

00:23:45.649 --> 00:23:48.915
metaphors and images drawn from
the world of his father's money

00:23:48.915 --> 00:23:51.940
lending.
To understand exactly what it

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.797
is that John Milton,
Jr.

00:23:53.797 --> 00:23:57.349
owes John Milton,
Sr., we have to look at the

00:23:57.349 --> 00:24:01.950
Latin poem that Milton writes to
his father in 1637.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:07.176
So let's look at that now.
This is page 82 in the Hughes

00:24:07.176 --> 00:24:11.849
edition and the poem is "To My
Father (Ad Patrem)."

00:24:11.849 --> 00:24:15.469
Milton expresses his debt of
gratitude for his father's

00:24:15.469 --> 00:24:18.743
support.
Milton graduated with an MA

00:24:18.743 --> 00:24:22.890
from Cambridge University in
July of 1632.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:26.601
He had studied hard obviously
and had supposedly been

00:24:26.601 --> 00:24:31.168
preparing himself for his future
career, and that would have been

00:24:31.168 --> 00:24:34.779
the career of a clergyman.
Milton's younger brother,

00:24:34.779 --> 00:24:37.307
Christopher,
was already entering law school

00:24:37.307 --> 00:24:39.070
at this time,
and it was clear,

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:41.539
I guess, to everybody that John
Milton, Jr.

00:24:41.539 --> 00:24:44.420
was not suited to a profession
in the law.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.460
(Although I'm actually not sure
why that's the case.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:51.920
Court records show that our
poet was exceedingly litigious.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.116
He brought suit against dozens
and dozens of people throughout

00:24:55.116 --> 00:24:58.223
his entire life,
attempting to address a wide

00:24:58.223 --> 00:25:03.092
range of grievances through the
use of the legal system.)But

00:25:03.092 --> 00:25:07.652
the vocation to which Milton
Junior seemed to have been most

00:25:07.652 --> 00:25:09.657
suited,
to everyone around him,

00:25:09.657 --> 00:25:11.801
was a life in the ministry.
His reading,

00:25:11.801 --> 00:25:14.848
his learning,
his talents as an orator -- all

00:25:14.848 --> 00:25:18.380
of these assets pointed to one
potential career,

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:22.158
and in fact nearly everyone in
the MA class in which Milton

00:25:22.158 --> 00:25:25.089
graduated turned to a career in
the church.

00:25:25.089 --> 00:25:30.647
This is what a master's degree
could do for you in the early

00:25:30.647 --> 00:25:33.366
seventeenth century.
Now we know,

00:25:33.366 --> 00:25:36.114
or at least we have a
retrospective inkling from our

00:25:36.114 --> 00:25:39.024
reading of poems like the
Nativity Ode and other

00:25:39.024 --> 00:25:41.904
early poems,
that Milton on some level was

00:25:41.904 --> 00:25:45.698
imagining his vocation to be
that of a poet -- but

00:25:45.698 --> 00:25:47.351
then,
just as now,

00:25:47.351 --> 00:25:51.890
one could obviously not be a
poet by profession.

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:55.970
You can't make a living writing
poetry.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:59.689
No one's ever made a living
writing poetry who hasn't been

00:25:59.689 --> 00:26:03.277
patronized or given a lot of
money by someone who's much

00:26:03.277 --> 00:26:10.103
richer than he or she is.
Maybe Rod McKuen in the

00:26:10.103 --> 00:26:18.470
‘60s made money writing
poetry..

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:22.467
With that exception,
I think very few people have

00:26:22.467 --> 00:26:27.547
actually, certainly in Milton's
day, profited from the selling

00:26:27.547 --> 00:26:31.030
of their poems.
Milton's father would obviously

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:34.646
have found unsuitable the idea
that seven years of expensive

00:26:34.646 --> 00:26:38.570
university education that he had
invested in his son would result

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:41.390
in nothing more than a career --
in what?

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:45.900
In poetry?!
Maybe some of you all too

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.537
easily can imagine the arguments
that might have taken place

00:26:49.537 --> 00:26:53.112
within the Milton household:
"Why don't you become a lawyer

00:26:53.112 --> 00:26:55.160
like your brother,
Christopher?

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:59.527
Why can't you get a job like
everybody else?"I'm going to

00:26:59.527 --> 00:27:03.458
ask you to imagine the domestic
situation in the Milton

00:27:03.458 --> 00:27:07.428
household in 1632.
Milton has just returned home

00:27:07.428 --> 00:27:11.349
after seven years at the
university, a university

00:27:11.349 --> 00:27:16.413
education so generously financed
by his father who was actually

00:27:16.413 --> 00:27:19.130
now 70 years old,
and John Milton, Jr.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:23.758
was just turning twenty-four.
Twenty-four is the canonical

00:27:23.758 --> 00:27:26.925
age at which young men were
received for admission into the

00:27:26.925 --> 00:27:28.916
priesthood.
It's like joining the army at

00:27:28.916 --> 00:27:30.215
eighteen;
at twenty-four,

00:27:30.215 --> 00:27:33.309
that's what you do if you have
an MA from Cambridge.

00:27:33.309 --> 00:27:35.769
You enter the Anglican
priesthood.

00:27:35.769 --> 00:27:40.007
And a twenty-four-year-old
Milton, after seven years of

00:27:40.007 --> 00:27:42.990
education, simply decides not to
go.

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:47.973
Instead of joining the
ministry, Milton instead returns

00:27:47.973 --> 00:27:53.140
home and he stays at home
without any means of supporting

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:57.400
himself for six years.
So with the financial support

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.800
of his father Milton stays at
home and reads.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:04.412
He studies.
And it's in these years after

00:28:04.412 --> 00:28:08.182
his graduation from college that
Milton embarks upon what is

00:28:08.182 --> 00:28:12.079
essentially a systematic study
of all available knowledge.

00:28:12.079 --> 00:28:15.158
He commands a mastery of just
about the entire canon of

00:28:15.158 --> 00:28:17.609
Western literary and historical
learning.

00:28:17.609 --> 00:28:21.769
He prepares himself for what
his father is still imagining

00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:25.637
will be the priesthood but for
what Milton is probably

00:28:25.637 --> 00:28:29.505
imagining will be his future
career as a great English

00:28:29.505 --> 00:28:33.738
poet.It's little wonder that
one of the subjects of his

00:28:33.738 --> 00:28:38.044
meditations during this period
is the problem of vocation --

00:28:38.044 --> 00:28:42.569
the twin problem of what it is
one is actually doing on the one

00:28:42.569 --> 00:28:46.209
hand,
and what it is on the other

00:28:46.209 --> 00:28:50.029
hand that the father has called
one to do.

00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:54.748
In Milton's poem to his father,
to his earthly father -- and it

00:28:54.748 --> 00:28:59.391
becomes a confusion throughout
Milton with respect to which of

00:28:59.391 --> 00:29:02.386
Milton's fathers,
the heavenly or the earthly,

00:29:02.386 --> 00:29:05.430
is calling him to do what -- in
Milton's poem to his father,

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:09.924
you have the poet's attempt to
justify himself before the man

00:29:09.924 --> 00:29:13.819
who seems to be asking him to
define his vocation.

00:29:13.819 --> 00:29:18.082
So we have to assume that the
occasion for this poem is some

00:29:18.082 --> 00:29:22.345
kind of question posed by John
Milton, Sr., a question like,

00:29:22.345 --> 00:29:25.380
"To what end am I supporting
you, Son?

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:29.428
And if it's a poet that you
want to be, to what extent can

00:29:29.428 --> 00:29:32.695
the writing of poetry be
considered respectable

00:29:32.695 --> 00:29:36.459
work?"Look at pages
eighty-two and eighty-three in

00:29:36.459 --> 00:29:39.615
the Hughes.
Milton's expressing a

00:29:39.615 --> 00:29:42.670
dutiful degree of filial piety
and gratitude,

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.099
and this may seem familiar,
too.

00:29:45.099 --> 00:29:48.720
"I could never repay you," he
writes:

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.205
…you have an
account of my means,

00:29:51.205 --> 00:29:53.857
and whatever [and now we're on
page eighty-three]

00:29:53.857 --> 00:29:56.839
wealth I possess I have
reckoned up on this paper,

00:29:56.839 --> 00:30:00.938
for I have nothing except what
golden Clio has given and what

00:30:00.938 --> 00:30:05.106
has been the fruit of the dreams
in a remote cavern and of the

00:30:05.106 --> 00:30:08.727
laurel groves of the sacred wood
and of the shadows of

00:30:08.727 --> 00:30:12.886
Parnassus.
"I have nothing to show for all

00:30:12.886 --> 00:30:17.343
of your investment but my
learning, all of that which

00:30:17.343 --> 00:30:22.400
golden Clio has promised me --
Clio the muse of history.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.631
I have also my aspirations,
my dreams of becoming a great

00:30:26.631 --> 00:30:31.240
poet because I dwell among these
highly literary -- the sacred

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.490
wood in the shady groves on
Parnassus."

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:38.089
Now Milton explains that he has
nothing now, of course,

00:30:38.089 --> 00:30:41.490
to show for his father's
investment, but he will.

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:46.056
Look at the last stanza.
This is at the top of page

00:30:46.056 --> 00:30:51.675
eighty-six in the Hughes.
Milton turns to address his

00:30:51.675 --> 00:30:54.785
own poetry.
This is how he concludes this

00:30:54.785 --> 00:30:57.276
poem, "Ad Patrem":
And you,

00:30:57.276 --> 00:31:01.869
my juvenile verses and
amusements, if only you dare

00:31:01.869 --> 00:31:07.106
hope for immortality and a life
and a glimpse of the light

00:31:07.106 --> 00:31:10.690
beyond your master's funeral
pyre,

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:14.874
and if dark oblivion does not
sweep you down into the throngs

00:31:14.874 --> 00:31:18.640
of Hades, perhaps you will
preserve this eulogy and the

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:22.894
name of the father whom my song
honors as an example to remote

00:31:22.894 --> 00:31:25.500
ages.
Milton's essentially making a

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.319
covenant.
This is a contract with his

00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:32.030
father in this passage.
He's engaging his father in to

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:35.094
a contractual situation just as
he will engage the entire

00:31:35.094 --> 00:31:38.594
English people (as we've already
seen) in The Reason of Church

00:31:38.594 --> 00:31:40.930
Government.
If his father continues to

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:43.755
support him -- this is the
magnificent logic here -- if the

00:31:43.755 --> 00:31:47.570
father continues to support him,
he will repay his father with

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:50.626
his own future fame,
a name that his fellow

00:31:50.626 --> 00:31:53.609
Englishmen will not willingly
let die.

00:31:53.609 --> 00:31:57.829
Milton's fame will preserve his
father's name;

00:31:57.829 --> 00:32:01.809
and of course,
it has throughout the ages.

00:32:01.809 --> 00:32:04.579
Needless to say,
the satisfaction of John

00:32:04.579 --> 00:32:07.240
Milton, Sr.
will have to be postponed to

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.531
the great hereafter.
He will not be able to reap the

00:32:10.531 --> 00:32:14.538
profit of his investment in his
son's study until not only after

00:32:14.538 --> 00:32:16.898
his own death,
but of course after his son's

00:32:16.898 --> 00:32:19.990
death as well.
That's Milton's logic here.

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:23.279
But then who would understand
better than John Milton,

00:32:23.279 --> 00:32:25.997
Sr.
the importance or the value of

00:32:25.997 --> 00:32:30.171
a long-term investment
strategy?There's a tone of

00:32:30.171 --> 00:32:34.506
self-assuredness and a
confidence and certainty in this

00:32:34.506 --> 00:32:36.495
poem that,
I have to say,

00:32:36.495 --> 00:32:39.411
isn't always matched in the
other works that Milton's

00:32:39.411 --> 00:32:43.200
writing in this same period.
In most of the other writings

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.373
that you have looked at for
today, the weird Calvinist logic

00:32:47.373 --> 00:32:51.121
surrounding the idea of divine
predestination makes it

00:32:51.121 --> 00:32:55.435
impossible for Milton to be that
comfortable or that confident

00:32:55.435 --> 00:32:58.829
about the idea of a true poetic
vocation.

00:32:58.829 --> 00:33:02.881
How can Milton know that he was
really and truly called by God

00:33:02.881 --> 00:33:06.668
to be a great poet until he
writes something -- it's not a

00:33:06.668 --> 00:33:10.520
bad question -- until he has
something actually to show for

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.018
his talent?
And how can Milton have

00:33:13.018 --> 00:33:16.468
anything to show for his talent
until he has -- this is the

00:33:16.468 --> 00:33:20.215
logic -- until he has patiently
waited for God to inspire him to

00:33:20.215 --> 00:33:22.254
write?
He can't know until he's been

00:33:22.254 --> 00:33:24.450
inspired to write,
and he can't of course start

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:27.458
writing until he's been inspired
-- it's a peculiar but familiar

00:33:27.458 --> 00:33:31.210
double bind.
It's a puzzle that proved

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:37.210
infinitely anxiety-producing for
the young Milton,

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:41.072
and it's really the productive
engine that keeps this extremely

00:33:41.072 --> 00:33:44.935
anxious poet going in the early
years.It's just this double

00:33:44.935 --> 00:33:48.299
bind of vocation that's the
subject of Sonnet VII,

00:33:48.299 --> 00:33:51.573
"How Soon Hath Time."
That's the sonnet in which

00:33:51.573 --> 00:33:55.210
Milton laments the fact that he
has turned twenty-three years

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:58.907
old and has yet produced nothing
that would indicate a shining

00:33:58.907 --> 00:34:01.259
poetic future.
In that poem,

00:34:01.259 --> 00:34:05.293
as in the other things that you
read for today,

00:34:05.293 --> 00:34:09.502
Milton is attempting to
understand the problem of

00:34:09.502 --> 00:34:14.150
vocation through the specific
lens of scripture,

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:15.519
and that's what we're going to
look at now.

00:34:15.519 --> 00:34:19.757
Nearly every conceptual problem
available and that was puzzled

00:34:19.757 --> 00:34:23.787
over in the seventeenth century
could be processed and then

00:34:23.787 --> 00:34:27.816
understood in some way in terms
of a related problem in the

00:34:27.816 --> 00:34:29.594
Bible.
Every conflict and

00:34:29.594 --> 00:34:32.481
contradiction within an
individual or within the society

00:34:32.481 --> 00:34:35.840
at large could be interpreted by
means of a related conflict,

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:39.219
or a related contradiction,
culled somewhere from the

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:42.652
writings of scripture.
For puritans such as Milton

00:34:42.652 --> 00:34:46.536
there were some especially
important moments in scripture

00:34:46.536 --> 00:34:50.420
that could be used to tackle the
problem of vocation.

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.822
There were particular moments
in the Bible that seemed best

00:34:52.822 --> 00:34:54.718
suited to answer this question,
the question,

00:34:54.718 --> 00:34:56.993
"What is it that I'm supposed
to do and what does it mean

00:34:56.993 --> 00:35:00.052
actually to do anything?
What does it mean to do

00:35:00.052 --> 00:35:05.002
anything in a world in which God
seems to be so entirely in

00:35:05.002 --> 00:35:09.440
control of all of our doings and
of our actions?"

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.540
Those passages of the Bible
that seem to have been

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:15.933
particularly useful for this
dilemma were two parables from

00:35:15.933 --> 00:35:19.145
the New Testament,
and those are represented in

00:35:19.145 --> 00:35:23.272
the packet: the parable of the
talents and the parable of the

00:35:23.272 --> 00:35:27.073
workers in the vineyard.
You will soon be seeing

00:35:27.073 --> 00:35:32.398
innumerable ways in which these
parables continue to creep up in

00:35:32.398 --> 00:35:35.951
Milton's verse.
The language -- we could also

00:35:35.951 --> 00:35:40.223
think of it as the ideology --
of these parables is constantly

00:35:40.223 --> 00:35:44.215
surfacing in Milton and provides
something like a divinely

00:35:44.215 --> 00:35:48.067
authorized focal point for what
I had mentioned earlier:

00:35:48.067 --> 00:35:52.480
this strange intersection of
spirituality and economics.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:56.069
I know it's a little difficult
to read, but I included

00:35:56.069 --> 00:36:00.065
nonetheless in the packet the
Geneva Bible (that's the great

00:36:00.065 --> 00:36:03.994
sixteenth-century Calvinist
Bible) -- that version of these

00:36:03.994 --> 00:36:08.125
two parables written before the
King James because it provides

00:36:08.125 --> 00:36:12.765
all of those glosses,
those marginal annotations on

00:36:12.765 --> 00:36:18.117
the side, those incredibly
mean-spirited and dark Calvinist

00:36:18.117 --> 00:36:22.874
interpretations of the Bible.
I'm convinced that those

00:36:22.874 --> 00:36:27.234
glosses, those annotations,
drove Milton absolutely mad and

00:36:27.234 --> 00:36:31.369
so much of his own rewriting of
the Bible essentially in

00:36:31.369 --> 00:36:35.053
Paradise Lost is a
response to a lot of the

00:36:35.053 --> 00:36:39.865
annotations of the Bible that he
grew up reading.So the first

00:36:39.865 --> 00:36:44.601
parable that we have to look at
is the one that without question

00:36:44.601 --> 00:36:48.210
instilled the most anxiety in
Milton,

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:51.480
and that's the parable of the
talents from Matthew 25.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.889
So this is the parable of the
talents.

00:36:52.889 --> 00:36:58.294
A master distributes his wealth
to his servants and the wealth

00:36:58.294 --> 00:37:01.750
is distributed in the form of a
coin,

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:05.623
and the name of the coin is
translated in English with the

00:37:05.623 --> 00:37:08.853
word talent.
It's precisely the word here

00:37:08.853 --> 00:37:12.654
for this coin that gives us our
modern word, our modern word

00:37:12.654 --> 00:37:15.468
talent,
which means "a skill," of

00:37:15.468 --> 00:37:18.110
course or "a predisposition."
Now think about it.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:23.379
That our word talent has
its origin in this parable

00:37:23.379 --> 00:37:28.834
should give you a sense of the
extraordinary cultural weight

00:37:28.834 --> 00:37:32.809
that this parable has
assumed.Okay.

00:37:32.809 --> 00:37:34.950
To one servant the master gave
five talents.

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:37.495
You remember this story.
To one servant the master gave

00:37:37.495 --> 00:37:39.457
five talents,
to another he gave two,

00:37:39.457 --> 00:37:41.909
and to a third servant he gave
one talent.

00:37:41.909 --> 00:37:45.346
When the master returns from
his journey, he learns that the

00:37:45.346 --> 00:37:48.550
first two servants had wisely
and piously invested their

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:50.912
talents,
and they had doubled their

00:37:50.912 --> 00:37:53.495
money.
They had profited and the

00:37:53.495 --> 00:37:56.965
master praises them.
But the servant who had been

00:37:56.965 --> 00:38:00.375
given only one talent hid the
talent in the earth so as --

00:38:00.375 --> 00:38:03.966
perfectly understandably -- so
as not to risk the only talent

00:38:03.966 --> 00:38:06.179
[laughs]
that he had been given.

00:38:06.179 --> 00:38:09.773
I think the genius of this
parable hinges on the fact that

00:38:09.773 --> 00:38:13.681
the servant who was only given
one talent seems to be acting so

00:38:13.681 --> 00:38:17.338
perfectly reasonably -- with a
laudable form of caution and

00:38:17.338 --> 00:38:19.750
hesitation,
you could actually say.

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:21.829
And so he explains to the
master:

00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:26.278
I knew thou was't an hard
man which reapest where thou

00:38:26.278 --> 00:38:30.199
sowedst not and gatherest where
thou strawest not.

00:38:30.199 --> 00:38:36.451
I was therefore afraid and I
went and hid thy talent in the

00:38:36.451 --> 00:38:39.816
earth.
Because the servant had not

00:38:39.816 --> 00:38:44.079
been willing to spend the only
talent that he had been given,

00:38:44.079 --> 00:38:47.794
the master instructs him to
give his one and only talent to

00:38:47.794 --> 00:38:50.801
the man who now has ten.
And the master concludes with

00:38:50.801 --> 00:38:53.300
an imperative that is surely one
of the most terrifying

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:57.188
utterances in the entire Bible:
Cast therefore that

00:38:57.188 --> 00:39:01.000
unprofitable servant into utter
darkness.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.739
There shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.

00:39:05.739 --> 00:39:09.912
The conclusion of this parable
seems so violent perhaps because

00:39:09.912 --> 00:39:13.949
the lesson to be learned from
the parable is so uncertain.

00:39:13.949 --> 00:39:17.805
Milton seems to have been drawn
to the parable as a way of

00:39:17.805 --> 00:39:21.998
understanding the expectations
placed upon him by his master --

00:39:21.998 --> 00:39:24.960
actually his two masters,
or his two fathers.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.253
There is first the earthly
father, John Milton,

00:39:28.253 --> 00:39:32.620
Sr., who had given Milton the
talent of an expensive education

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:37.059
and then six years of additional
heavily subsidized study;

00:39:37.059 --> 00:39:40.601
and there is also the Heavenly
Father, who had given Milton his

00:39:40.601 --> 00:39:44.028
rhetorical gifts and expected
him to use them in some way for

00:39:44.028 --> 00:39:47.513
God's benefit -- presumably to
use them in some way beneficial

00:39:47.513 --> 00:39:51.111
to the church (the most obvious
way being naturally the vocation

00:39:51.111 --> 00:39:54.699
of the ministry).
And the parable is a horrifying

00:39:54.699 --> 00:39:58.601
one because it places such an
unspeakable pressure on the

00:39:58.601 --> 00:40:01.110
interpreter to produce
something,

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:03.940
to show something for himself
at the end of the day.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.329
And for Milton,
whose temperament up to this

00:40:06.329 --> 00:40:08.829
point inclined him obviously to
hesitation,

00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:12.330
to postponement,
and to merely the anticipation

00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:16.364
of profit, the pressure applied
by this parable of the

00:40:16.364 --> 00:40:20.398
unprofitable servant may very
well have seemed utterly

00:40:20.398 --> 00:40:24.280
unbearable.But there was
another parable,

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:27.793
another of Jesus' parables that
also treated the problem of

00:40:27.793 --> 00:40:30.498
vocation.
And like the parable of the

00:40:30.498 --> 00:40:34.954
talents, it provided what seemed
to be a model for a kind of

00:40:34.954 --> 00:40:38.112
pattern of action,
or actually the trajectory of a

00:40:38.112 --> 00:40:41.360
career: and this is the parable
of the workers in the vineyard.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:46.891
Here a householder looks for
laborers that he will pay a

00:40:46.891 --> 00:40:50.288
penny a day.
The laborers who began to work

00:40:50.288 --> 00:40:53.734
at dawn earn a penny,
the laborers hired in the third

00:40:53.734 --> 00:40:57.380
hour earn a penny and the
laborers who stood idle in the

00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:01.224
marketplace until the eleventh
hour -- who were asked to do

00:41:01.224 --> 00:41:05.267
nothing until the last possible
moment -- they also received a

00:41:05.267 --> 00:41:08.780
penny for their pains at the end
of the day,

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:12.004
"their pains such as they
were."Now when asked by the

00:41:12.004 --> 00:41:15.516
hardest workers why "each of the
laborers received every man a

00:41:15.516 --> 00:41:17.788
penny,"
the householder replies,

00:41:17.788 --> 00:41:20.929
"Take that which is thine own
and go thy way.

00:41:20.929 --> 00:41:25.110
I will give unto this last as
much as to thee."

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:27.962
So in this parable,
which has suggested to

00:41:27.962 --> 00:41:32.066
generations of readers something
like socialism or a form of

00:41:32.066 --> 00:41:34.632
communism,
the amount of labor actually

00:41:34.632 --> 00:41:37.532
expended is immaterial,
so that the latecomer to the

00:41:37.532 --> 00:41:40.945
job is rewarded the same as the
worker who was there from the

00:41:40.945 --> 00:41:44.130
very beginning and working from
the very beginning.

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:48.584
As a model of economic activity
or as a kind of vocation guide,

00:41:48.584 --> 00:41:52.824
this parable couldn't be more
opposed -- or to some wouldn't

00:41:52.824 --> 00:41:56.704
seem more opposed -- to the
parable of the unprofitable

00:41:56.704 --> 00:41:59.293
servant.
The men who stood around and

00:41:59.293 --> 00:42:02.515
did nothing until they were
called to act earned precisely

00:42:02.515 --> 00:42:05.964
the same amount as those who had
been laboring in the vineyard

00:42:05.964 --> 00:42:09.512
all day.
They're not punished for their

00:42:09.512 --> 00:42:13.175
unprofitable expectation.
They're not punished for just

00:42:13.175 --> 00:42:14.739
waiting around to be called to
work.

00:42:14.739 --> 00:42:16.921
They're not bidden to be cast
out in to utter darkness where

00:42:16.921 --> 00:42:18.400
there's weeping and gnashing of
teeth.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.879
They're rewarded for
their waiting.This parable

00:42:21.879 --> 00:42:24.809
may seem, I think,
to be a little more compatible

00:42:24.809 --> 00:42:27.983
with Milton's general
temperament in the years of his

00:42:27.983 --> 00:42:31.306
studious retirement.
As a young man consumed with

00:42:31.306 --> 00:42:35.029
anxiety about his failure yet to
do anything, whether to gain

00:42:35.029 --> 00:42:38.875
employment as a clergyman or to
produce somehow some great work

00:42:38.875 --> 00:42:42.225
of literature -- Milton's
continually seeking assurance

00:42:42.225 --> 00:42:45.947
that the latecomer (and this is
how he's thinking of himself)

00:42:45.947 --> 00:42:49.410
will be rewarded,
that the latecomer will be

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:53.255
actually able to produce
something when he is called to

00:42:53.255 --> 00:42:57.489
produce something.
For Milton these two parables

00:42:57.489 --> 00:43:02.400
were locked in a powerful
dialectical relation to one

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:06.140
another.
The "parable of the talents"

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.420
rewards hard work and
investment;

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:12.700
and it's satisfying because it
does that,

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:16.679
but it also instills an anxiety
about non-productivity.

00:43:16.679 --> 00:43:20.906
The "parable of the vineyard"
assures us that God rewards us

00:43:20.906 --> 00:43:24.130
regardless of our hard work and
investment,

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:29.809
but only if we're called,
only if God chooses us.

00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:33.617
And so you can see the strange
dialectic developing here:

00:43:33.617 --> 00:43:37.016
the anxiety aroused by one
parable necessitates the

00:43:37.016 --> 00:43:40.280
consolation that's offered by
the other one,

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:44.798
but the consoling parable soon
arouses its own anxieties,

00:43:44.798 --> 00:43:48.751
which only can be quieted by
recourse to the other

00:43:48.751 --> 00:43:52.313
parable.The result,
needless to say,

00:43:52.313 --> 00:43:55.521
is mind-spinning.
We're all familiar with at

00:43:55.521 --> 00:43:59.204
least a version of this.
All of us just as human beings,

00:43:59.204 --> 00:44:03.207
all of us want to be rewarded.
We want to be loved for our

00:44:03.207 --> 00:44:06.809
hard work, and we're all working
really hard here.

00:44:06.809 --> 00:44:09.564
But of course,
we also want to be loved -- we

00:44:09.564 --> 00:44:12.444
want to be rewarded
unconditionally without any

00:44:12.444 --> 00:44:16.264
contingencies whatsoever.
On some level that's just the

00:44:16.264 --> 00:44:20.083
human condition.
And Milton uses the language of

00:44:20.083 --> 00:44:25.198
these two parables to get at
this problem that has resonances

00:44:25.198 --> 00:44:29.291
in every conceivable
sphere.Now shortly after

00:44:29.291 --> 00:44:33.809
Milton composed the sonnet "How
Soon Hath Time,"

00:44:33.809 --> 00:44:38.303
 he wrote a letter to a
friend in which he enclosed this

00:44:38.303 --> 00:44:41.471
poem, the sonnet.
This is in the packet after the

00:44:41.471 --> 00:44:43.580
parables.
We don't know the intended

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:46.699
recipient of this letter,
and we actually have no idea

00:44:46.699 --> 00:44:49.230
whether Milton actually sent the
letter;

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:52.744
but a couple of drafts of this
letter actually exist in

00:44:52.744 --> 00:44:55.673
Milton's own hand,
and the letter is clearly a

00:44:55.673 --> 00:44:59.970
document that Milton had devoted
some energy and some time to.

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:02.539
We need to look at it.
The unnamed friend sounds

00:45:02.539 --> 00:45:05.610
quite a bit actually like
Milton's disapproving father.

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:08.696
The friend has obviously chided
Milton for not doing anything

00:45:08.696 --> 00:45:11.061
with his life.
Milton has shown so much

00:45:11.061 --> 00:45:13.089
promise.
He possessed so many obvious

00:45:13.089 --> 00:45:16.195
talents that could be poured
into the profession for which he

00:45:16.195 --> 00:45:19.146
was so clearly suited -- the
profession of the ministry --

00:45:19.146 --> 00:45:22.253
but Milton was remaining at his
father's house in what seemed

00:45:22.253 --> 00:45:24.116
like a perpetual state of
humiliating

00:45:24.116 --> 00:45:27.438
self-infantilization.
He seems to have been doing

00:45:27.438 --> 00:45:30.583
nothing but reading,
acquiring more knowledge and

00:45:30.583 --> 00:45:34.579
really essentially just learning
for the sake of learning.

00:45:34.579 --> 00:45:38.650
And so Milton responds to what
he takes to be this objection.

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:41.916
He responds in the second
paragraph of the letter in the

00:45:41.916 --> 00:45:45.302
left-hand column of the packet
to this criticism that he's

00:45:45.302 --> 00:45:47.964
doing so little.
Milton acknowledges that the

00:45:47.964 --> 00:45:51.019
course he's chosen for himself
may not be a natural one:

00:45:51.019 --> 00:45:55.327
Nature herself pushes a
young man to begin a family and

00:45:55.327 --> 00:45:58.630
to seek credible employment
[Milton writes].

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:02.793
The natural desire for fame
seated in the breast of every

00:46:02.793 --> 00:46:07.253
true scholar usually pushes him
to make haste by the readiest

00:46:07.253 --> 00:46:11.639
way of publishing and divulging
conceived merits.

00:46:11.639 --> 00:46:14.559
But it's just this making haste
toward publication -- writing

00:46:14.559 --> 00:46:17.820
something really great right now
-- that Milton's resisting here.

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:21.482
He claims to be studying and
learning rather than producing

00:46:21.482 --> 00:46:24.106
right now;
and there's a problem with just

00:46:24.106 --> 00:46:27.236
studying and learning,
and it's a problem that Milton

00:46:27.236 --> 00:46:29.916
can't avoid.
It's possible that in merely

00:46:29.916 --> 00:46:33.469
reading and in merely amassing
more and more knowledge,

00:46:33.469 --> 00:46:37.587
Milton's doing little more than
the unprofitable servant in

00:46:37.587 --> 00:46:40.375
Matthew 25.
It's possible that he's hiding

00:46:40.375 --> 00:46:43.920
his talent or burying his
conceived merits deep within the

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.810
earth,
and it's this frightening

00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:52.590
possibility that Milton forces
himself to engage head on -- the

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:57.251
implications of this
parable.Look in the packet

00:46:57.251 --> 00:47:03.590
at this letter near the top of
the right-hand side of the page.

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:06.958
Milton claims that his love of
learning might seem to

00:47:06.958 --> 00:47:09.550
contradict the parable of the
talents.

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:12.025
The master had commanded his
servants, of course,

00:47:12.025 --> 00:47:14.811
to do something -- to show a
profit in a due and timely

00:47:14.811 --> 00:47:16.837
fashion,
but Milton wants his friend

00:47:16.837 --> 00:47:19.600
here to know that there's,
of course, nothing to worry

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.837
about.
This is how Milton's mind is

00:47:21.837 --> 00:47:24.910
working overtime here.
This is the argument:

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:29.282
Milton's pursuing his learning.
He's postponing his publication

00:47:29.282 --> 00:47:32.780
because it's his job really to
consider the master's great

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:34.989
commandment all the more
closely.

00:47:34.989 --> 00:47:38.089
The point of the parable,
Milton explains -- this is an

00:47:38.089 --> 00:47:41.474
unbelievable misreading of the
biblical test -- the point of

00:47:41.474 --> 00:47:44.860
the parable is not that the
servant should have invested his

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:48.098
one talent just anywhere.
The servant's problem was that

00:47:48.098 --> 00:47:51.021
he didn't take enough time.
He didn't carefully consider

00:47:51.021 --> 00:47:54.313
the command, because a careful
consideration of the master's

00:47:54.313 --> 00:47:57.991
command, and I'm quoting here:
…does not press

00:47:57.991 --> 00:48:01.683
forward as soon as may be to
undergo but keeps off with the

00:48:01.683 --> 00:48:05.820
sacred reverence and religious
advisement how best to undergo,

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:10.809
not taking thought of being
late so as to give advantage to

00:48:10.809 --> 00:48:13.510
be more fit.
Unbelievable.

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:15.769
You look at a passage like that
in complete astonishment.

00:48:15.769 --> 00:48:19.160
Milton has invoked,
of course to his own detriment

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:22.222
-- what was he thinking?
-- the parable of the

00:48:22.222 --> 00:48:25.230
unprofitable servant,
the parable of the talents.

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:28.023
But he invokes it to show that
if one really reads it carefully

00:48:28.023 --> 00:48:30.636
enough, one can see that the
lesson to be drawn has nothing

00:48:30.636 --> 00:48:33.294
whatsoever to do with the due
and timely investment of one's

00:48:33.294 --> 00:48:35.601
talent.
What this parable really

00:48:35.601 --> 00:48:40.191
teaches us is that we do best to
wait, we do best to consider the

00:48:40.191 --> 00:48:42.782
command,
to consider all of the possible

00:48:42.782 --> 00:48:45.291
investment strategies.
Maybe we want to go into the

00:48:45.291 --> 00:48:47.090
ministry, maybe we want to go
into poetry.

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:50.313
Perhaps we want to write like
Shakespeare, maybe we want to be

00:48:50.313 --> 00:48:53.219
a writer like the great Old
Testament prophet Isaiah.

00:48:53.219 --> 00:48:55.920
But the last thing we should be
burdened with,

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.619
Milton's suggesting here,
is the fear of being

00:48:58.619 --> 00:49:02.159
late.Now I don't have to
tell you that Milton has done a

00:49:02.159 --> 00:49:05.219
powerful violence to this
parable in Matthew.

00:49:05.219 --> 00:49:09.090
Now God only knows what this
parable actually means.

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:11.570
It's perfectly inscrutable as
far as I'm concerned.

00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:15.738
But I think I can say with
absolute certainty that one of

00:49:15.738 --> 00:49:19.980
its possible significances
cannot be that the unprofitable

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:24.000
servant should have waited to
make his investment.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.961
Now think of it:
if Milton had been the servant,

00:49:25.961 --> 00:49:28.299
he wouldn't even have made it
to the stage of burying the

00:49:28.299 --> 00:49:30.867
stupid coin in the earth.
He would be consumed with the

00:49:30.867 --> 00:49:33.723
consideration of whether to bury
it here or whether to bury it

00:49:33.723 --> 00:49:35.969
there -- or should he bury it
two feet under,

00:49:35.969 --> 00:49:49.370
or maybe he should bury it six
feet under?Okay.

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:53.602
I'm going to stop there.
There's a lot more to say about

00:49:53.602 --> 00:49:57.092
the parable of the talents and
the parable of the laborers in

00:49:57.092 --> 00:49:59.127
the vineyard,
but we have run out of

00:49:59.127 --> 00:50:00.127
time.

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.640
Professor Langdon
Hammer: Today I'm going to

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.905
try to talk a little bit more
about Elizabeth Bishop,

00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:14.580
and I'm also going to try to
give some big perspectives on

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.829
the poets we've been reading and
also some ways of thinking about

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:22.290
how they fit together.
 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.998
Let's look at Bishop's poem,
"Over 2,000 Illustrations and a

00:00:27.998 --> 00:00:33.551
Complete Concordance,"
the poem placed second in her

00:00:33.551 --> 00:00:39.344
second book called A Cold
Spring, published in

00:00:39.344 --> 00:00:46.030
1955--the latest poems that
we'll discuss in this course.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.866
On Wednesday I talked about
Bishop's poetics of geography or

00:00:52.866 --> 00:01:00.872
travel as a horizontal poetics,
as opposed to the ascendant and

00:01:00.872 --> 00:01:08.157
sublime impulses in many of the
poets that we have been

00:01:08.157 --> 00:01:11.260
examining this term.
 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:18.204
This poetics is ultimately a
poetry of shifting perspectives

00:01:18.204 --> 00:01:21.030
and local perceptions.
 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.288
The question that it
immediately poses is,

00:01:26.288 --> 00:01:33.471
well: how do we put these
perceptions and these points of

00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:37.332
view together?
The, I think,

00:01:37.332 --> 00:01:43.661
exciting but also difficult
textures of Bishop's great

00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:48.540
landscape poems,
"Florida," "Cape Breton," "At

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.680
the Fishhouses," "A Cold
Spring," and others,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.849
all pose this very clearly to
us, this problem.

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:04.670
You might see the grains of
sand that the sandpiper searches

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.110
through in that little poem
"Sandpiper" as,

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.340
again, exemplary of this
problem in Bishop--that is,

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.250
how do we hold onto,
organize,

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.784
and find coherence in a world
of discrete and shifting

00:02:26.784 --> 00:02:31.186
phenomena?
This is really the master

00:02:31.186 --> 00:02:37.443
problem that Bishop addresses
very self-consciously in this

00:02:37.443 --> 00:02:44.240
poem, "Over 2,000 Illustrations
and a Complete Concordance."

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.665
Like "The Map," it's a poem
that is in part about a

00:02:49.665 --> 00:02:53.366
representation.
She, by implication,

00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:58.656
begins the poem by referring to
a book, presumably the one

00:02:58.656 --> 00:03:03.205
mentioned in the title,
"Over 2,000 Illustrations and a

00:03:03.205 --> 00:03:04.790
Complete Concordance."
 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.189
What kind of book is that?
 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.598
She doesn't specify,
but as the poem unfolds there's

00:03:09.598 --> 00:03:13.341
reason to believe it's a Bible,
I think--perhaps a family

00:03:13.341 --> 00:03:14.949
Bible.
She says:

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:16.940
Thus should have been our
travels:

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.222
serious, engravable.
Our travels,

00:03:22.222 --> 00:03:27.179
our experience in the world,
our experience of geography,

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:31.428
and our experience as geography
should have been,

00:03:31.428 --> 00:03:33.730
ought to be,
serious.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.949
It ought to add up to something.
 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:39.870
I ought to be engravable,
something that might be bound

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.129
in book form.
The image of a book with

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:51.392
illustrations in a complete
concordance holds up an idea

00:03:51.392 --> 00:03:57.454
that word and image,
perhaps word and flesh or

00:03:57.454 --> 00:04:04.472
representation and experience,
might be bound together in a

00:04:04.472 --> 00:04:10.368
coherent unity,
might be shown to exist in

00:04:10.368 --> 00:04:17.089
concordance or in some kind of
correspondence.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:21.202
Against this ideal or this
model of things,

00:04:21.202 --> 00:04:26.000
where illustration and text are
bound together,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.822
Bishop poses her own wayward
experience--her travels--which

00:04:32.822 --> 00:04:38.863
this poem will list,
record, and give us fragments

00:04:38.863 --> 00:04:42.486
of.
What the poem reveals to us is

00:04:42.486 --> 00:04:48.360
a world of discrete fragments,
parts that gain meaning,

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.558
if at all, through their mere
adjacency or through the

00:04:53.558 --> 00:04:58.756
perceiver who holds them
together--holds them together

00:04:58.756 --> 00:05:04.150
through the quality of her
attention and the sensibility

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.305
behind it,
a form of attention for Bishop

00:05:08.305 --> 00:05:13.477
that is always pushing towards
revelation and seeking meaning

00:05:13.477 --> 00:05:18.389
or something beyond surface
detail but never quite arrives

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.819
there and never,
in that sense,

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:27.139
arrives at a place of repose or
rest or home.

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:32.542
Let me read the second
paragraph which brilliantly

00:05:32.542 --> 00:05:38.826
represents the world brought
into being by this poetics of

00:05:38.826 --> 00:05:42.452
geography.
Entering the Narrows at

00:05:42.452 --> 00:05:43.170
St.
Johns

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.490
the touching bleat of goats
reached to the ship.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.209
We glimpsed them,
reddish, leaping up the cliffs

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:53.500
among the fog-soaked weeds and
butter-and-eggs.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.447
And at St.
Peter's the wind blew and the

00:05:57.447 --> 00:06:01.173
sun shone madly.
Rapidly, purposefully,

00:06:01.173 --> 00:06:04.029
the Collegians marched in
lines,

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:08.069
crisscrossing the great square
with black, like ants.

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:12.148
The poem is composed almost of
the fragments of a travel diary

00:06:12.148 --> 00:06:15.743
or bits of a letter,
and if you read Bishop's

00:06:15.743 --> 00:06:20.962
letters you will indeed find
observations like this on every

00:06:20.962 --> 00:06:23.750
page.
In Mexico the dead man lay

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.560
in a blue arcade;
the dead volcanoes

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.970
glistened like Easter lilies.
 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.889
The jukebox went on playing
"Ay, Jalisco!"

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:36.710
And at Volubilis there were
beautiful poppies

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:44.190
splitting the mosaics;
the fat old guide made eyes.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.623
In Dingle Harbor…
And we jerk from one place to

00:06:48.623 --> 00:06:55.730
another, with each sentence one
country, one spot on the map.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.230
In Dingle Harbor a golden
length of evening

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.639
the rotting hulks held up their
dripping plush.

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:05.620
The Englishwoman poured tea,
informing us

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.439
that the duchess was going to
have a baby.

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:12.761
[This is one of Bishop's
provocative juxtapositions in

00:07:12.761 --> 00:07:15.889
the poem.]
And in the brothels of Marrakesh

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:17.649
the little pockmarked
prostitutes

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:19.680
balanced their tea-trays on
their heads

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.480
and did their belly-dances;
flung themselves

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.760
naked and giggling against our
knees,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.560
asking for cigarettes.
 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.953
It was somewhere near there
I saw what frightened me most

00:07:31.953 --> 00:07:35.263
of all [implying,
of course, that all of these

00:07:35.263 --> 00:07:38.507
scenes had frightened her]:
A holy grave,

00:07:38.507 --> 00:07:42.553
not looking particularly holy,
one of a group under a

00:07:42.553 --> 00:07:47.146
keyhole-arched stone baldaquin
open to every wind from the

00:07:47.146 --> 00:07:50.093
pink desert.
An open, gritty,

00:07:50.093 --> 00:07:53.250
marble trough,
carved solid

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:59.629
with exhortation, yellowed
as scattered cattle-teeth;

00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:02.709
half-filled with dust,
not even the dust

00:08:02.709 --> 00:08:06.790
of the poor prophet paynim who
once lay there.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:12.424
[Just dust.]
In a smart burnoose Khadour

00:08:12.424 --> 00:08:18.730
[presumably their guide]
looked on amused.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:26.555
Looking at this series,
this way Bishop's life seems to

00:08:26.555 --> 00:08:34.381
add up, she continues reflecting
on the poem and on its

00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:39.497
structure.
Everything only connected

00:08:39.497 --> 00:08:41.490
by "and" and "and."
 

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.813
Open the book.
And we're back to the book now,

00:08:45.813 --> 00:08:50.673
that ideal form of
representation in which text and

00:08:50.673 --> 00:08:53.936
image are bound.
(The gilt rubs off the

00:08:53.936 --> 00:08:55.715
edges
of the pages and pollinates the

00:08:55.715 --> 00:08:58.831
fingertips.)
Bishop wants us--as in "The

00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:03.909
Map," too--she wants the book as
something that can be held and

00:09:03.909 --> 00:09:08.262
touched.
She's a marvelously tactile

00:09:08.262 --> 00:09:10.719
poet.
Along with the unity of

00:09:10.719 --> 00:09:15.200
experience that it promises to
give us is a sense of intimacy,

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.889
too, with an object.
 

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:19.810
Open the heavy book [she
says to us].

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:24.870
Why couldn't we have seen
this old Nativity while we were

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:28.154
at it?
-- the dark ajar,

00:09:28.154 --> 00:09:34.083
the rocks breaking with light,
an undisturbed,

00:09:34.083 --> 00:09:38.389
unbreathing flame,
colorless, sparkless,

00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:44.178
freely fed on straw,
and, lulled within,

00:09:44.178 --> 00:09:49.551
a family with pets,
-- and looked and looked our

00:09:49.551 --> 00:09:51.250
infant sight away.
 

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:56.940
 
 

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.498
The Nativity is the scene of
the Incarnation,

00:10:01.498 --> 00:10:05.850
that moment when the Word is
made flesh;

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:11.785
Christmas morning,
that moment when the divine

00:10:11.785 --> 00:10:19.039
takes human form and so becomes
present in the world.

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:22.686
This is specifically here,
as Bishop imagines it,

00:10:22.686 --> 00:10:24.509
a scene of revelation.
 

00:10:24.509 --> 00:10:29.278
That wonderful phrase,
"the dark ajar"--as if the

00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:33.649
shadow were a door and you could
enter it;

00:10:33.649 --> 00:10:42.637
"the rocks breaking with
light"--that which is solid

00:10:42.637 --> 00:10:48.559
opening.
What emerges is a flame,

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:51.679
a sign of spirit.
 

00:10:51.679 --> 00:10:57.580
But notice how in this light,
the sacred is secularized.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:02.865
What Bishop finds there is not
the holy family but "a family

00:11:02.865 --> 00:11:07.130
with pets."
There is nostalgia here,

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:11.909
in this poem,
poignant and powerful;

00:11:11.909 --> 00:11:17.296
that is, a nostalgia not so
much for the holy as for the

00:11:17.296 --> 00:11:22.779
family once constituted by their
relation to the holy,

00:11:22.779 --> 00:11:29.344
the family with pets but also
the family that gathered around

00:11:29.344 --> 00:11:35.143
the book to look at them – a
family gathered through

00:11:35.143 --> 00:11:40.144
religious practice,
who might then have "looked and

00:11:40.144 --> 00:11:42.629
looked our infant sight away."
 

00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:49.139
In that, looking expresses a
kind of primal longing for

00:11:49.139 --> 00:11:55.649
community and for human
connection--a longing expressed

00:11:55.649 --> 00:11:59.503
through looking,
importantly for Bishop,

00:11:59.503 --> 00:12:02.830
which is really what the poet
is doing in "The Map,"

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:07.928
I think, in the way that she
invites us into her act of

00:12:07.928 --> 00:12:10.100
looking in that poem.
 

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:15.870
Here Bishop's nostalgia is sad
but also resigned.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:21.508
This Nativity is a scene that
can be remembered and looked at

00:12:21.508 --> 00:12:28.010
from afar but not entered into,
as the belief system that it

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:35.296
comes out of and refers to can
be looked at from afar but not

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:39.464
entered into.
Bishop, as several people

00:12:39.464 --> 00:12:44.268
remarked in section this week,
calls us back in lots of

00:12:44.268 --> 00:12:46.669
different ways to Frost.
 

00:12:46.669 --> 00:12:53.466
Frost is perhaps an unusual
place to begin a course on

00:12:53.466 --> 00:12:58.340
modern poetry because--remember
him?

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:04.128
– he really is generally an
exception to the metropolitan

00:13:04.128 --> 00:13:08.220
scene and inspiration of modern
poetry.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:12.685
Modern poetry is a poetry of
the city, of the metropolis,

00:13:12.685 --> 00:13:16.362
of the world city,
and of the place where the

00:13:16.362 --> 00:13:19.005
world's peoples,
goods, languages,

00:13:19.005 --> 00:13:22.850
traditions and cultures are all
"accessible,"

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:30.559
to use Marianne Moore's word
from her poem "New York."

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:33.089
Pound, Eliot,
Crane, Moore,

00:13:33.089 --> 00:13:38.341
Hughes, and even Williams and
Stevens in their somewhat

00:13:38.341 --> 00:13:41.746
different ways,
are all poets of the

00:13:41.746 --> 00:13:45.928
metropolis.
The sense of ambivalence about

00:13:45.928 --> 00:13:50.984
modernity in these poets is an
ambivalence in many ways about

00:13:50.984 --> 00:13:55.871
the city and what it promises
and also what it in many ways

00:13:55.871 --> 00:13:57.809
threatens us with.
 

00:13:57.809 --> 00:14:02.299
Their sense of experience,
their visions of modernity and

00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:07.669
of modern forms of community are
all located and expressed there.

00:14:07.669 --> 00:14:14.230
Frost aggressively defines his
work against that context.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.423
In doing this,
he links his writing to

00:14:17.423 --> 00:14:22.256
nineteenth-century American
writing and art and links his

00:14:22.256 --> 00:14:28.229
writing to rural culture,
which dominates the nineteenth

00:14:28.229 --> 00:14:32.773
century.
There is an anti-modern strain

00:14:32.773 --> 00:14:39.080
in Frost just as there is in
Yeats and, more complexly,

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:42.000
in Pound and in Eliot.
 

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.098
What's modern about Frost is
what has changed in the rural

00:14:46.098 --> 00:14:50.365
cultures that he writes about;
that is, the collapse of

00:14:50.365 --> 00:14:54.378
farming economies and
communities and the decay of

00:14:54.378 --> 00:14:56.998
nineteenth-century
Protestantism,

00:14:56.998 --> 00:15:00.519
the white church on the village
green.

00:15:00.519 --> 00:15:07.882
You feel that loss in the
terrific aloneness of Frost's

00:15:07.882 --> 00:15:12.092
people.
The great poem "Directive" is

00:15:12.092 --> 00:15:14.870
about all of these things.
 

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:22.409
Frost's poetry struggles to
incorporate the secular truths

00:15:22.409 --> 00:15:29.023
of modern science and to make
poetry, like science,

00:15:29.023 --> 00:15:32.860
a disenchanted knowledge.
 

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:38.282
In this way,
Frost has a lot in common with

00:15:38.282 --> 00:15:43.059
Auden, and Frost,
again like Auden,

00:15:43.059 --> 00:15:47.947
is fundamentally concerned with
poetry as a form of knowledge,

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:50.029
a way to know the world.
 

00:15:50.029 --> 00:15:54.137
At the same time,
poetry preserves for Frost

00:15:54.137 --> 00:15:57.480
certain archaic,
primitive powers of

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:02.829
enchantment: powers associated
with primitive motives and

00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:08.274
childhood experience that make
it a crucial alternative to

00:16:08.274 --> 00:16:12.000
science and scientific knowing.
 

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.306
Think of the magic trick at the
end of "Directive" when Frost

00:16:17.306 --> 00:16:22.790
takes us to the ruined house of
nineteenth-century culture--the

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:27.655
ruined farmhouse of "Home
Burial" maybe--and steals from

00:16:27.655 --> 00:16:32.254
the abandoned children's
playhouse "a broken drinking

00:16:32.254 --> 00:16:37.738
goblet like the Grail" and uses
it to invite us to drink from a

00:16:37.738 --> 00:16:42.779
primal source "too lofty and
original to rage,"

00:16:42.779 --> 00:16:47.664
that spring,
and in drinking to "be whole

00:16:47.664 --> 00:16:50.840
again beyond confusion."
 

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.202
What are we drinking there then
at the end of Frost's poem,

00:16:55.202 --> 00:16:59.490
this poem published at the end
of the Second World War?

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:05.478
We're drinking a kind of
elemental power that seems to

00:17:05.478 --> 00:17:10.450
fuse language and longing and
imagination.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.588
This is, in Frost,
a conscious rewriting,

00:17:14.588 --> 00:17:20.486
I think, partially even a
send-up as well as a competition

00:17:20.486 --> 00:17:26.073
with Eliot in The Waste
Land and the Grail myths

00:17:26.073 --> 00:17:30.936
that are one of the central
motifs of that poem:

00:17:30.936 --> 00:17:37.247
one of the central motifs that
embody for Eliot a sense of the

00:17:37.247 --> 00:17:40.687
holy,
which is present,

00:17:40.687 --> 00:17:46.127
however, for Eliot only through
literary allusion,

00:17:46.127 --> 00:17:51.233
something fascinating but
unavailable as actual

00:17:51.233 --> 00:17:55.608
experience;
something available only,

00:17:55.608 --> 00:17:58.309
in a sense, as quotation.
 

00:17:58.309 --> 00:18:01.575
Poetry in Frost,
as in Eliot,

00:18:01.575 --> 00:18:06.240
does the work religion no
longer does.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:12.479
But notice how in Frost,
in "Directive," the belief that

00:18:12.479 --> 00:18:17.471
poetry asks from us is a belief
in a fiction,

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:22.741
in make-believe.
And in this Frost is strangely

00:18:22.741 --> 00:18:28.945
and wonderfully and surprisingly
perhaps fully the contemporary

00:18:28.945 --> 00:18:34.648
of Wallace Stevens and Hart
Crane whose work proceeds from

00:18:34.648 --> 00:18:37.250
that same assumption.
 

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:45.120
Stevens's wartime poem "Asides
on the Oboe" begins:

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.660
The prologues are over.
 

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.460
It is a question, now,
Of final belief.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:56.170
So, say that final belief
Must be in a fiction.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:01.672
It is time to choose.
This is the theme of Stevens's

00:19:01.672 --> 00:19:06.500
wartime masterpiece "Notes
Towards a Supreme Fiction."

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.980
And notice the contradictory
impulses in Stevens's title.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:16.323
When poetry takes the place of
religion for Stevens it presents

00:19:16.323 --> 00:19:21.235
itself as a supreme fiction,
a total representation of the

00:19:21.235 --> 00:19:23.390
world and experience.
 

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:28.891
But we only have partial,
provisional access to that

00:19:28.891 --> 00:19:33.322
fiction.
What Stevens gives us is merely

00:19:33.322 --> 00:19:38.405
notes – notes,
something that Elizabeth Bishop

00:19:38.405 --> 00:19:41.650
might present us with,
too.

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.911
In this sense,
in Stevens the shift from

00:19:44.911 --> 00:19:49.509
religion to poetry is also a
shift from totalization,

00:19:49.509 --> 00:19:55.774
from system to contingency and
incompletion,

00:19:55.774 --> 00:20:00.289
to parts rather than a whole.
 

00:20:00.289 --> 00:20:04.104
For Stevens,
the disappearance of the

00:20:04.104 --> 00:20:08.660
Christian God as the center of
emotional,

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:14.134
spiritual, cultural life is
essentially, however,

00:20:14.134 --> 00:20:17.099
a cause for celebration.
 

00:20:17.099 --> 00:20:26.653
In Eliot it's a cause for
mourning--mourning and anxiety,

00:20:26.653 --> 00:20:31.765
distress.
In Yeats it's a cause of

00:20:31.765 --> 00:20:38.842
fascination and horror;
in Crane, for the making of new

00:20:38.842 --> 00:20:41.569
myths, new metaphors.
 

00:20:41.569 --> 00:20:48.049
Hughes's secular poems are
Christ-haunted.

00:20:48.049 --> 00:20:54.492
Christ and all of the
iconography associated with him

00:20:54.492 --> 00:21:01.555
is a source of hope and also
irony for black culture and a

00:21:01.555 --> 00:21:05.519
reproach to the white world.
 

00:21:05.519 --> 00:21:10.868
How do people,
how does culture find bearing

00:21:10.868 --> 00:21:15.470
in a world without divine
sanction?

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:19.573
This is played out as an
ethical question,

00:21:19.573 --> 00:21:25.177
a question about how to live
and act rightly in Moore and

00:21:25.177 --> 00:21:27.680
then later in Bishop.
 

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:32.982
In general, it is a less urgent
question, a less central one in

00:21:32.982 --> 00:21:36.660
the later poets than in the
earlier ones.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:41.207
"Things fall apart;
the centre cannot hold," Yeats

00:21:41.207 --> 00:21:43.950
says in "The Second Coming."
 

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:49.201
Bishop is fundamentally at home
in this condition,

00:21:49.201 --> 00:21:55.309
which is a condition of
centerlessness or homelessness.

00:21:55.309 --> 00:22:04.015
She liked the phrase "the
world's an orphan's home" in

00:22:04.015 --> 00:22:10.358
Moore.
Bishop is at home then with a

00:22:10.358 --> 00:22:15.559
certain kind of homelessness.
 

00:22:15.559 --> 00:22:22.779
Travel is her metaphor for the
mobility of consciousness in a

00:22:22.779 --> 00:22:26.630
world without a stable center.
 

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:32.884
Her poetry is written from the
disturbingly and disorientingly

00:22:32.884 --> 00:22:38.934
decentered point of view that we
find already in those early

00:22:38.934 --> 00:22:42.609
poems of hers,
a point of view that takes for

00:22:42.609 --> 00:22:46.147
granted the absence of central
authority that religion once

00:22:46.147 --> 00:22:48.801
provided.
Remember in "Over 2,000

00:22:48.801 --> 00:22:53.730
Illustrations and a Complete
Concordance" that holy grave?

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:57.539
It's not even particularly
holy, she says.

00:22:57.539 --> 00:23:04.370
The place of the sacred in
Bishop has been vacated.

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:07.420
Might poetry fill it?
 

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:12.339
This isn't a question Bishop
asks or is concerned with.

00:23:12.339 --> 00:23:16.181
But it is, as I've been
suggesting, an urgent one in

00:23:16.181 --> 00:23:19.420
many ways for the poets who
preceded her.

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:24.014
The poetry of the period 1920
through 1940,

00:23:24.014 --> 00:23:30.578
say--really the great phase of
modern poetry-- this period is

00:23:30.578 --> 00:23:35.918
structured,
I think, by two big questions:

00:23:35.918 --> 00:23:41.960
how should poetry be written
and what can it do,

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.789
what can it accomplish in the
world?

00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:50.679
In the first lecture I talked
about these different impulses

00:23:50.679 --> 00:23:54.326
which are at once opposing but
also, I think,

00:23:54.326 --> 00:23:56.730
related and interlocking.
 

00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:01.940
I called one of them formal and
inward-turning,

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.983
an aesthetic;
the other rather outward

00:24:05.983 --> 00:24:10.672
turning, concerned with the
moral, the political,

00:24:10.672 --> 00:24:15.168
and the social.
The first one tends to limit

00:24:15.168 --> 00:24:21.233
the definition of poetry to say
what is particular to this art,

00:24:21.233 --> 00:24:24.950
to isolate what is essential to
it.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:28.815
The other works to extend
poetry's scope,

00:24:28.815 --> 00:24:33.840
to give it an expanded role in
culture, in the world,

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.869
and in our lives.
 

00:24:35.869 --> 00:24:41.123
You see different versions of
both of these impulses in the

00:24:41.123 --> 00:24:43.750
career trajectories of H.D.
 

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:50.434
and William Carlos Williams,
who begin as masters of a

00:24:50.434 --> 00:24:57.875
certain kind of short poem and
go on to create epic poems of

00:24:57.875 --> 00:25:05.190
cultural sweep – H.D.'s being
called Trilogy,

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:08.579
Williams's Paterson.
 

00:25:08.579 --> 00:25:15.249
But the poet who more than any
embodies these two impulses in

00:25:15.249 --> 00:25:19.140
the shape of his career is
Pound,

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:23.008
of course: as I said,
the author of the shortest and

00:25:23.008 --> 00:25:25.740
the longest poem in modern
poetry,

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:31.492
the exponent of Imagism,
and the author of The

00:25:31.492 --> 00:25:35.063
Cantos.
Imagism seems to want to get

00:25:35.063 --> 00:25:38.011
outside of history,
to explore the "sudden

00:25:38.011 --> 00:25:41.750
liberation… from space limits
and time limits,"

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:47.930
Pound says, in a kind of
autonomous aesthetic experience.

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:51.419
The Cantos,
however, are a poem,

00:25:51.419 --> 00:25:55.000
as Pound called it,
"including history":

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.970
a poem of the greatest possible
range and scope and ambition.

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:08.904
In Imagism, there's an attempt
to establish the primary poetic

00:26:08.904 --> 00:26:15.799
unit, to cut away what is
inessential, to find what is

00:26:15.799 --> 00:26:19.130
true.
This is a kind of formal

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:24.440
program that expresses a drive
towards truth telling that we

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:30.289
find in somewhat different terms
in Frost and Auden and Moore.

00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:37.834
Think of Frost's sense of fact
versus, in "Mowing," the "easy

00:26:37.834 --> 00:26:42.109
gold at the hand of fay or elf."
 

00:26:42.109 --> 00:26:48.517
Or think of Yeats's stylistic
transformation as expressed in

00:26:48.517 --> 00:26:55.359
that short poem "A Coat" or "The
Fisherman," poems from 1915.

00:26:55.359 --> 00:27:01.884
Think about Moore's and Auden's
severe revisions of their work,

00:27:01.884 --> 00:27:08.198
in each case involving cutting
out poems or cutting away many

00:27:08.198 --> 00:27:13.460
lines in order to arrive at what
Moore called,

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:18.407
in "Poetry," that poem
subjected to severe revision,

00:27:18.407 --> 00:27:23.178
"the genuine."
These are all creative acts of,

00:27:23.178 --> 00:27:28.264
I think you could say,
self-limitation and they're

00:27:28.264 --> 00:27:34.285
linked to the general recurrent
theme in these poets – in

00:27:34.285 --> 00:27:38.230
these poets in particular:
Auden,

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:45.339
Moore, Frost – to the general
theme of restraint or reticence.

00:27:45.339 --> 00:27:48.859
"The deepest feeling always
shows itself in silence;

00:27:48.859 --> 00:27:52.509
/ not in silence,
but restraint."

00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:58.243
Remember Auden's stone god
"that never was more reticent,

00:27:58.243 --> 00:28:02.849
/ always afraid to say more
than he meant."

00:28:02.849 --> 00:28:07.732
This impulse that I'm
describing in modern poetry is

00:28:07.732 --> 00:28:12.710
also related to formal
experiments with restraint.

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:19.799
You see this worked into
Moore's syllabics.

00:28:19.799 --> 00:28:24.556
Modern poetry in many ways
seeks to restrain the singing

00:28:24.556 --> 00:28:29.313
voice and the lyric voice of
romantic poetry as received

00:28:29.313 --> 00:28:32.599
through nineteenth-century
poetry.

00:28:32.599 --> 00:28:37.573
Frost's vernacular,
his will to get the "sound of

00:28:37.573 --> 00:28:42.339
sense" into his poems functions
in this way.

00:28:42.339 --> 00:28:46.369
So does Hughes's vernacular,
his black speech.

00:28:46.369 --> 00:28:52.890
Think about Eliot's syntactic
and logical discontinuities and

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:57.128
disjunctions,
the way they interrupt and

00:28:57.128 --> 00:29:02.494
fragment lyric utterance,
or think about Pound's

00:29:02.494 --> 00:29:07.730
incorporation of blocks of
prose, as he did in The

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:11.112
Cantos.
There is in all of these

00:29:11.112 --> 00:29:16.044
examples a tendency to define
what is modern in modern poetry

00:29:16.044 --> 00:29:20.400
by the incorporation of
traditionally non-poetic forms

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:25.594
of speech and language use and,
moreover and importantly,

00:29:25.594 --> 00:29:30.509
non-traditional methods of
organizing poetic language.

00:29:30.509 --> 00:29:34.389
At the same time,
this impulse can be seen as a

00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:38.690
way not of limiting or
curtailing poetry's scope,

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:41.327
but rather the opposite:
expanding it,

00:29:41.327 --> 00:29:44.819
expanding it to include even,
as Moore puts it,

00:29:44.819 --> 00:29:48.963
"school-books and business
documents," making poetry

00:29:48.963 --> 00:29:53.512
available for people and
cultures and experience that had

00:29:53.512 --> 00:29:57.250
not previously been represented
in poetry.

00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:03.281
Other modern poetry is
experimental in a very different

00:30:03.281 --> 00:30:09.872
way, indeed in its revival and
recovery and incorporation of

00:30:09.872 --> 00:30:13.000
historical poetic forms.
 

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.886
You could understand Hart
Crane's reclaiming of

00:30:18.886 --> 00:30:24.260
Elizabethan and
nineteenth-century forms of

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:30.913
ornamental rhetoric and
versification as exactly this

00:30:30.913 --> 00:30:36.799
kind of reclaiming of archaic
materials.

00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:43.361
There's something similar going
on in Pound, in Pound's recovery

00:30:43.361 --> 00:30:49.193
of Provençal and Anglo-Saxon
verse forms, his revival of

00:30:49.193 --> 00:30:54.408
these forms.
Pound and Crane are both heroic

00:30:54.408 --> 00:30:56.896
poets.
They answer that question –

00:30:56.896 --> 00:30:58.060
what can poetry do?
 

00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.890
what can it effect in culture?
 

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:05.630
– by saying simply
"everything."

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:09.743
That's really the extraordinary
presumption of their long poems

00:31:09.743 --> 00:31:13.259
– The Bridge and
The Cantos.

00:31:13.259 --> 00:31:19.486
They are very different poets,
however, and to some extent

00:31:19.486 --> 00:31:23.200
exposed – no,
opposed figures,

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:32.374
although indeed their claim for
poetry made them both exposed

00:31:32.374 --> 00:31:38.950
figures in poignant and
complicated ways.

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:41.346
When I talk about their
difference, I'm thinking of

00:31:41.346 --> 00:31:44.141
Pound's suspicion of rhetoric,
his suspicion of

00:31:44.141 --> 00:31:47.533
representation,
and his will or drive to get

00:31:47.533 --> 00:31:51.950
beyond these things versus
Crane's faith in rhetoric,

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:55.554
faith in rhetoric and
imagination, and their power to

00:31:55.554 --> 00:31:57.079
transform the world.
 

00:31:57.079 --> 00:32:00.720
In a sense, you couldn't have
two more different poets.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:05.939
But both of these poets take
poetry as a kind of metaphor,

00:32:05.939 --> 00:32:10.518
as not only a metaphor but as
the salient instance,

00:32:10.518 --> 00:32:14.090
of the creative impulse in
history.

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:15.660
What makes history happen?
 

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:21.640
What makes action in history?
 

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:27.601
And they place poetry at the
center of all that is most

00:32:27.601 --> 00:32:30.140
important that we do.
 

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:36.235
They both propose that poetry
can fulfill the central

00:32:36.235 --> 00:32:41.509
mediating functions that
religion once did.

00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:45.475
Pound and Crane become
cautionary figures for later

00:32:45.475 --> 00:32:49.460
poets.
To some extent Yeats does, too;

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:53.962
that is, figures who seem to
show the limits of poetry

00:32:53.962 --> 00:32:57.700
precisely in their efforts to
expand them.

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:03.508
This is one way we can
understand Bishop's poem,

00:33:03.508 --> 00:33:08.700
"Visits to St.
Elizabeth's" on page 133.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:15.368
This is a poem that describes
Bishop's periodic visits to Ezra

00:33:15.368 --> 00:33:20.068
Pound in St.
Elizabeths Hospital where Pound

00:33:20.068 --> 00:33:23.895
was institutionalized,
incarcerated,

00:33:23.895 --> 00:33:31.109
after his return to the United
States on charges of treason.

00:33:31.109 --> 00:33:35.929
Bishop was living in Washington
as the Poetry Consultant to the

00:33:35.929 --> 00:33:40.594
Librarian of Congress and it
befell her almost as an official

00:33:40.594 --> 00:33:43.800
duty to visit Pound,
hear him talk,

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:49.164
and bring people to Pound,
and it became the occasion for

00:33:49.164 --> 00:33:54.720
this poem built on the form of
"This is the House that Jack

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:59.559
Built."
This is the poetry that Jack

00:33:59.559 --> 00:34:01.175
made.
This is the house of

00:34:01.175 --> 00:34:02.380
Bedlam.
This is the man

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.340
that lies in the house of
Bedlam.

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.369
This is the time
of the tragic man

00:34:07.369 --> 00:34:10.280
that lies in the house of
Bedlam.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:14.062
And she continues adding,
each time adding and,

00:34:14.062 --> 00:34:18.092
of course, in Bishop's
distinctive manner not only

00:34:18.092 --> 00:34:22.780
repeating but revising the terms
that she's given us;

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:27.909
again, a poetics of constant
readjustment.

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:34.525
As the poem builds,
characters are included,

00:34:34.525 --> 00:34:42.986
not only Pound but Pound
represented as the man but also

00:34:42.986 --> 00:34:47.757
a soldier,
a boy, and a Jew,

00:34:47.757 --> 00:34:54.223
figures that are versions of
Pound perhaps,

00:34:54.223 --> 00:35:00.690
reaching a climax in the final
stanza:

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:03.590
This is the soldier home
from the war.

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:07.260
[Perhaps that's Pound in some
sense.]

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:10.679
These are the years and the
walls and the door

00:35:10.679 --> 00:35:13.530
that shut on a boy that pats
the floor

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:15.870
to see if the world is round or
flat.

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:23.679
[Again, Bishop touching a map.]
This is a Jew in a newspaper hat

00:35:23.679 --> 00:35:27.599
that dances carefully down the
ward,

00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:30.660
walking the plank of a coffin
board

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.780
with the crazy sailor
that shows his watch

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.559
that tells the time
of the wretched man

00:35:34.559 --> 00:35:38.220
who lies in the house of
Bedlam.

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:41.030
It's a great poem.
 

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:45.769
I spoke of Auden's and Bishop's
perspectivism.

00:35:45.769 --> 00:35:50.423
Here, Bishop gives us multiple
perspectives on Pound and by

00:35:50.423 --> 00:35:55.157
extension on the social and
political ambitions of modernist

00:35:55.157 --> 00:35:58.809
poetry.
Pound is "tragic," "talkative,"

00:35:58.809 --> 00:36:03.811
"honored," "old," "brave,"
"cranky," "cruel," and finally

00:36:03.811 --> 00:36:09.440
simply "wretched" – a word
that comes from "The Seafarer."

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:17.178
Arguably, one strain of modern
poetry ends here in 1950 in the

00:36:17.178 --> 00:36:19.969
madhouse, in Bedlam.
 

00:36:19.969 --> 00:36:25.971
Importantly though,
it is not that Bishop stands

00:36:25.971 --> 00:36:31.590
apart form, in a position to
judge, Pound.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:38.161
Instead, she is interestingly,
I think, implicated in the

00:36:38.161 --> 00:36:41.850
scene.
She must have enjoyed,

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:47.477
and by her choice of title
calls attention to,

00:36:47.477 --> 00:36:54.854
the irony that Pound is in a
madhouse that has the same name

00:36:54.854 --> 00:36:59.733
as Bishop.
In Bishop's great war poem

00:36:59.733 --> 00:37:06.433
"Roosters," there is a sense
that to oppose conflict out in

00:37:06.433 --> 00:37:12.440
the world one must encounter
conflict in oneself.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:19.593
Here, too, I think in multiple
ways Bishop implicates herself

00:37:19.593 --> 00:37:24.840
in the objects of her critique
and satire.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.380
The child's verse form,
it's important.

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:32.884
Bishop identifies with,
I think it's fair to say –

00:37:32.884 --> 00:37:36.593
she's certainly interested in
– children,

00:37:36.593 --> 00:37:38.889
throughout her poetry.
 

00:37:38.889 --> 00:37:43.311
This interest points,
I think, to Bishop's sense of

00:37:43.311 --> 00:37:48.950
herself as a minor poet;
that is, a mapmaker,

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:54.632
not a historian;
a poet who refuses to write the

00:37:54.632 --> 00:37:59.675
major, culturally central,
aggressively ambitious poetry

00:37:59.675 --> 00:38:06.936
to which modernism and,
above all, the poetry of Pound

00:38:06.936 --> 00:38:10.891
aspired.
Auden's perspectivism in

00:38:10.891 --> 00:38:17.120
"Musée des Beaux Arts" seems to
position the poet and poetry

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:20.803
similarly.
So does that famous statement

00:38:20.803 --> 00:38:24.344
in the Yeats elegy,
"For poetry makes nothing

00:38:24.344 --> 00:38:26.260
happen."
These poems,

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:30.125
"Musée des Beaux Arts" and "In
Memory of W.B.

00:38:30.125 --> 00:38:34.763
Yeats," read like rebukes to
modern poetry's promethean

00:38:34.763 --> 00:38:40.981
ambitions – its verticality,
if you like – and rebukes,

00:38:40.981 --> 00:38:46.829
too, to Auden's own political
poetry of the 1930s,

00:38:46.829 --> 00:38:51.679
exemplified by a poem like
"Spain 1937."

00:38:51.679 --> 00:38:55.105
But, as I stressed,
Auden doesn't put a full stop

00:38:55.105 --> 00:38:58.103
on that sentence,
"For poetry makes nothing

00:38:58.103 --> 00:39:01.800
happen."
Rather, he punctuates it with a

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:05.099
colon and continues,
"it survives."

00:39:05.099 --> 00:39:08.949
There is perhaps a double
implication here.

00:39:08.949 --> 00:39:14.562
Either poetry does not have an
effect on the world but still

00:39:14.562 --> 00:39:19.889
survives, despite its lack of
making something happen,

00:39:19.889 --> 00:39:25.679
or it survives because it makes
nothing happen.

00:39:25.679 --> 00:39:32.112
It is not a cause and it
doesn't take up causes

00:39:32.112 --> 00:39:36.052
effectively.
What it does rather,

00:39:36.052 --> 00:39:40.611
as Auden represents it here,
is create a space:

00:39:40.611 --> 00:39:44.528
a space of happening,
a landscape,

00:39:44.528 --> 00:39:51.068
and a model of the world,
seen in the same time as a

00:39:51.068 --> 00:39:56.849
valley and a river,
the river that flows through it.

00:39:56.849 --> 00:40:01.999
There's terrific power of
affirmation in this claim about

00:40:01.999 --> 00:40:06.690
poetry's survival at the moment
of Yeats's death,

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:12.651
at the moment of the onset of
the Second World War when "all

00:40:12.651 --> 00:40:15.380
the dogs of Europe bark."
 

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:20.287
Ultimately, in Auden,
poetry survives as "a way of

00:40:20.287 --> 00:40:25.995
happening," as he calls it,
that is, a "way" in a sense of

00:40:25.995 --> 00:40:30.692
both a method and a path;
and implicitly,

00:40:30.692 --> 00:40:36.429
as I suggested talking about
this poem earlier;

00:40:36.429 --> 00:40:44.499
it survives as a kind of open
space, a place to come into to

00:40:44.499 --> 00:40:48.739
collect and gather in for us.
 

00:40:48.739 --> 00:40:54.059
And it is figured,
I think, finally and implicitly

00:40:54.059 --> 00:41:00.791
as a mouth, the human mouth –
open to speak old words and new

00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:05.898
words, too.
Poetry survives in my mouth and

00:41:05.898 --> 00:41:10.610
also in yours,
which seems like a good last

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:14.650
sentence to end this course
with.

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:25.000
So, thank you very much.

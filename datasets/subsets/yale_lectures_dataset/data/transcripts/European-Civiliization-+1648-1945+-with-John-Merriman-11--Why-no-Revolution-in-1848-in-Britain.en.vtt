00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:04.753
Prof: Today,
what I want to do is talk about

00:00:04.753 --> 00:00:06.170
the revolutions of 1848.
 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.570
Read the chapter.
 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.370
It's not very long.
 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.684
I want to talk principally
about why there was no

00:00:13.684 --> 00:00:18.285
revolution in Britain in 1848,
since there were revolutions in

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:22.378
France,
in the Hapsburg domains of the

00:00:22.378 --> 00:00:26.777
Austrian empire,
what would become in 1867

00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:29.450
Austria-Hungary,
in Prussia,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:36.071
in the Rhineland,
and in Northern and Central

00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:39.640
Italy,
but not in Britain.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.140
I want to talk about that.
 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.098
But before I do that,
let's just think about

00:00:44.098 --> 00:00:47.470
revolution in general and how
revolutions work.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.530
I'll mention this again when we
get to the Russian revolution.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.458
If you think about what you
know about the French Revolution

00:00:54.458 --> 00:00:56.593
in this context,
hopefully it will make some

00:00:56.593 --> 00:00:57.090
sense.
 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.049
In the 1960s many social
scientists, not all,

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.656
believed that revolutions came
when pressure builds up and

00:01:08.656 --> 00:01:11.890
you've got intellectuals bailing
out,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.780
leaving the regime.
 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.088
Then you've got all this
tension building up and then

00:01:16.088 --> 00:01:17.909
boom, you've got your basic
revolution.

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.610
But revolutions don't work like
that.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.688
If you think about revolutions
you know anything about,

00:01:21.688 --> 00:01:25.150
the Iranian revolution in 1979
would be a good example,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.593
or the revolutions we're going
to talk about today a little

00:01:28.593 --> 00:01:30.489
bit,
that you're reading about in

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:32.900
1848,
or the French Revolution.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.849
What happens is that in the
case of 1848,

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:40.140
or in the case of the other
ones that I've mentioned,

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.702
is that there is a seizure of
power by a group who have come

00:01:46.702 --> 00:01:53.486
together because they oppose the
policies of the government in

00:01:53.486 --> 00:01:54.599
power.
 

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:59.156
But it's at that point that
you've got an increase in social

00:01:59.156 --> 00:02:01.010
and political tension.
 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.040
It's at that point that tension
really increases and all sorts

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.340
of interesting things begin to
happen.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.650
In the case of 1917 in St.
 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.050
Petersburg, in February the
bread lines are very long.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.389
There are not a lot of troops
around.

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:19.068
They're at the front.
 

00:02:19.068 --> 00:02:20.990
There are not a lot of police
around.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.473
Suddenly, the czarist regime is
just sort of swept away,

00:02:26.473 --> 00:02:27.669
like that.
 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:30.610
It's at that point that things
heat up.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.348
In 1917 things weren't any
tenser than they were in 1916,

00:02:34.348 --> 00:02:37.598
and there are a lot of things
happening vis-Ã -vis the

00:02:37.598 --> 00:02:39.470
war that helped people mobilize.
 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.942
Try to imagine a post-czarist
world or a reformed czarist

00:02:45.942 --> 00:02:47.330
autocracy.
 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:54.210
In the case of 1848 you've got
demonstrations in Paris.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.949
In February--it rains all the
time in Paris in February.

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:58.280
It's gray.
 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.520
People want electoral reform.
 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.360
Troops open up and shoot a
bunch of people.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.889
The same thing happens in
Berlin not long after that.

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.650
At that point you've got the
regime that's swept away.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.098
What's interesting about the
revolutionary process is that

00:03:14.098 --> 00:03:17.848
after you've got this kind of
basic, provisional government.

00:03:17.848 --> 00:03:24.264
In the case of all--what the
constitutional monarchy in 1789

00:03:24.264 --> 00:03:28.376
and 1790 becomes,
and in the case of Kerensky's

00:03:28.376 --> 00:03:33.329
provisional government in 1917,
and in the case of this kind of

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.053
moderate republic in France,
or in Germany,

00:03:37.053 --> 00:03:39.758
or in Austria,
you've still got the monarchy,

00:03:39.758 --> 00:03:42.847
but you have all these
contenders for power who are

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:45.954
saying at that point,
"We want to take advantage

00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:48.782
of the situation so that we will
have a republic,"

00:03:48.782 --> 00:03:50.598
or,
in the case of France,

00:03:50.598 --> 00:03:52.502
"that women will have more
rights,"

00:03:52.502 --> 00:03:54.750
or "that workers will have
more rights."

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.964
In the case of the German
states, people who want a

00:03:58.964 --> 00:04:03.598
unified Germany put forth their
claims at that point.

00:04:03.598 --> 00:04:06.181
In the case of France,
people want the monarchy,

00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:08.381
the Bourbons,
that is the legitimists who

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:09.919
were chased out in 1830.
 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:10.569
They want them back.
 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:11.990
They put in their claims.
 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.306
You've got your basic moderate
republicans that are saying,

00:04:15.306 --> 00:04:17.709
"We want a moderate
republic."

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.016
In the case of Austria you've
got all these Viennese students

00:04:22.016 --> 00:04:23.379
who want reforms.
 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:25.129
They want a progressive regime.
 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:27.848
It's at that point that this
sort of social tension and

00:04:27.848 --> 00:04:29.360
political tension increases.
 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.889
What the revolutionary process
does,

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.050
and what's important about
1848,

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.470
is that it brings,
for the first time,

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.690
lots more people into the
political process.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.185
In the case of France,
my friend Maurice Agulhon has

00:04:43.185 --> 00:04:46.613
called the "apprenticeship
of the republic,"

00:04:46.613 --> 00:04:51.940
that is 1848 to December 2,
1851 and really 1852.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.730
Because now you've got
universal manhood suffrage.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.899
All men can vote.
 

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:59.310
Lots of women want to vote, too.
 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.324
It's not a dominant course,
but it's still important in

00:05:03.324 --> 00:05:03.920
Paris.
 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.850
So, you have a politicization
of ordinary people.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.600
You have this in the German
states.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.221
You have it in the Italian
states as well,

00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:14.589
and you have it in
Austria-Hungary.

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:17.507
In the case of Austria-Hungary,
you've got Hungarians putting

00:05:17.507 --> 00:05:20.509
forth special claims within the
Hapsburg domains,

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:25.262
and the national question
surfaces in central Europe and

00:05:25.262 --> 00:05:27.680
in Italy,
where people can imagine a

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.218
unified Italy,
which would mean you have to

00:05:30.218 --> 00:05:32.449
get rid of the Austrians,
basically.

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.050
You can read about what happens
subsequently.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.730
You have these people putting
forth their claims.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.079
You have this remarkable
politicization.

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:43.788
In the case of Paris,
the barricades go up,

00:05:43.788 --> 00:05:45.660
which happened in February.
 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.850
Then the June Days follow,
which is basically a sort of

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:55.154
class war in which lots of
people get killed and put in

00:05:55.154 --> 00:06:00.459
prison--massive unrest for three
days in June 1848.

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:03.562
That's a much more violent
confrontation and telling

00:06:03.562 --> 00:06:07.213
confrontation than the initial
revolutionary seizure of power

00:06:07.213 --> 00:06:11.350
by groups who don't necessarily
agree on what's going to happen.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.310
In the case of France,
which is the best documented,

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.026
you've got all these newspapers
that begin publishing because

00:06:18.026 --> 00:06:20.379
now suddenly you can publish
things.

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:23.870
You've got all these political
clubs, just as in 1848.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.560
You've got neo-Jacobin clubs.
 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.360
You've got clubs of women.
 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.899
You've got the club of the two
sexes, as it's called.

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:36.329
This becomes a way of
politicizing ordinary people.

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:41.834
When men go to the polls in
1848 in April for the first time

00:06:41.834 --> 00:06:45.940
and they elect a relatively
conservative,

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.740
indeed monarchist leading
national assembly,

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:55.339
they do so with considerable
knowledge about what they want.

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:56.389
They want schoolteachers.
 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:59.310
They want credit available.
 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.879
They want the right to vote.
 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:04.141
This politicization,
or the apprenticeship of a

00:07:04.141 --> 00:07:09.069
republic that would finally be
permanent starting in the 1870s,

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:12.649
is one of the most important
aspects of the Revolution.

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:14.040
The same thing is in the
Russian Revolution,

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.269
which I'll come back and talk
about.

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:16.519
You've got Mensheviks.
 

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:17.230
You've got Bolsheviks.
 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.089
You've got socialist
revolutionaries.

00:07:19.089 --> 00:07:21.889
These are three big radical
groups.

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:24.449
You've got constitutional
democrats.

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:25.720
You've got monarchists.
 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.230
You've got people who want the
czar to have all the power that

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.016
he had before,
and to lop off the heads of

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:32.310
those people who are against him
and that kind of thing.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.089
In the case of the Russian
Revolution,

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:38.670
how you get from the February
revolution to October,

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.639
when the Bolsheviks seize
power,

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:43.209
is really very fascinating.
 

00:07:43.209 --> 00:07:45.240
That's just a way of thinking
about revolution.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.940
You can think about other
revolutions that you know.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:54.875
The point is that the
revolution as a process brings

00:07:54.875 --> 00:08:00.579
into play the aspirations of a
lot more people.

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:04.639
The French case,
which is fascinating,

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:07.360
is what begins as this kind of
urban,

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.665
middle-class revolution of
people fought by artisans,

00:08:10.665 --> 00:08:13.209
as usual,
who want the right to vote,

00:08:13.209 --> 00:08:18.865
ends up in December 1851,
after Napoleon's nephew Louis

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:22.666
Napoleon Bonaparte,
who had become the good old

00:08:22.666 --> 00:08:25.396
Napoleon III,
not so good old--he destroys

00:08:25.396 --> 00:08:27.850
the republic,
where he completes a process of

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.750
repression that he'd already,
as president of France,

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.441
elected on the 10^(th) of
December 1848,

00:08:33.441 --> 00:08:34.269
initiated.
 

00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:37.980
But that very ordinary people,
peasants for the most part,

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.009
but also rural artisans,
particularly in the south and

00:08:41.009 --> 00:08:44.695
not necessarily speaking French,
at all rise up to try to defend

00:08:44.695 --> 00:08:48.039
the republic or what they
call la Belle,

00:08:48.039 --> 00:08:51.360
the beautiful one,
against the rape,

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.043
as they called it,
by the repressive apparatus

00:08:56.043 --> 00:08:58.038
centered in Paris.
 

00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:02.927
This urban revolution ends up
with over 100,000 people taking

00:09:02.927 --> 00:09:04.965
arms,
and the largest national

00:09:04.965 --> 00:09:08.256
insurrection in France in the
nineteenth century trying to

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:11.605
defend the republic against its
abolition by Louis Napoleon

00:09:11.605 --> 00:09:14.890
Bonaparte,
who would not be able to stand

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:18.669
for a second term as president
of the republic.

00:09:18.669 --> 00:09:21.100
That's really fascinating.
 

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.094
A long time ago I used to read
all these interrogations of

00:09:24.094 --> 00:09:26.970
people,
including the great, great,

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.710
great uncle of one of our
neighbors in ArdÃ¨che.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.705
It's being translated from
Occitan, which is the language

00:09:31.705 --> 00:09:34.701
of that part of the south,
into French by some translator

00:09:34.701 --> 00:09:36.360
as he's being interrogated.
 

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.168
"When did you join the
secret society?"

00:09:38.168 --> 00:09:41.538
"Who did you initiate into
the secret society?"

00:09:41.538 --> 00:09:45.672
to defend the republic,
the democratic and social

00:09:45.672 --> 00:09:50.750
republic that's going to provide
more things to more people,

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:51.095
etc.
 

00:09:51.095 --> 00:09:51.870
etc.
 

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.500
Fascinating,
the politicization of this.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:10:02.996
Now, in the case of Germany and
of Italy, it's a different kind

00:10:02.996 --> 00:10:05.190
of revolution.
 

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.519
It still had its kind of
liberal and democratic

00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:11.138
component,
but you had this scene,

00:10:11.138 --> 00:10:13.610
for example,
in Frankfurt in the Frankfurt

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.513
parliament,
which was basically a lot of

00:10:16.513 --> 00:10:21.101
professors and lawyers debating
long into the night in St.

00:10:21.101 --> 00:10:22.470
Paul's church.
 

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:26.519
They imagine the unification of
Germany,

00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:30.077
what they called then the
"springtime of the

00:10:30.077 --> 00:10:32.821
peoples,"
that the German states,

00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:35.490
which Prussia,
Saxony, Bavaria,

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:39.200
and Wurtemburg were the most
important of these states.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.085
All these other little states,
too, are going to be unified

00:10:43.085 --> 00:10:44.759
along liberal auspices.
 

00:10:44.759 --> 00:10:46.720
They were just dreaming.
 

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:52.106
In the end they were kind of
dismissed as a servant who was

00:10:52.106 --> 00:10:57.029
not wanting to be kept on at the
big house anymore.

00:10:57.029 --> 00:10:58.779
They're sort of dismissed.
 

00:10:58.779 --> 00:11:01.110
But they debate far into the
night.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.958
The significance of all of this
is when you read the

00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.528
chapter--please do--on the
Second Republic,

00:11:06.528 --> 00:11:11.128
and you see what happens in the
case of the German states is

00:11:11.128 --> 00:11:14.090
that when Germany would be
unified,

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:19.832
and that unification is
proclaimed in January 1871 in

00:11:19.832 --> 00:11:22.942
Versailles,
in the Chateau of Versailles

00:11:22.942 --> 00:11:26.452
after the Franco-Prussian War,
it would not be a liberal

00:11:26.452 --> 00:11:27.350
unification.
 

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:32.239
It would not be a Germany
united by lawyers and professors

00:11:32.239 --> 00:11:36.614
meeting in a Frankfurt church
with what would become

00:11:36.614 --> 00:11:41.511
eventually the German flag,
the colors of it hanging all

00:11:41.511 --> 00:11:43.049
around the rafters.
 

00:11:43.049 --> 00:11:45.980
It would be unified,
as Bismarck accurately put it,

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:51.110
"by blood and iron,"
in the context of the Prussian

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.529
aristocracy, the nobles,
the Junkers,

00:11:54.529 --> 00:11:58.179
a term you already know,
J-U-N-K-E-R-S,

00:11:58.179 --> 00:12:02.429
or Prussian nobles,
and that basically unified

00:12:02.429 --> 00:12:06.360
Germany would be,
as some wag once put it,

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.460
"an army with a state
trailing behind it."

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:14.908
Germany would not be a republic;
it would be an empire.

00:12:14.908 --> 00:12:17.600
Because one of the things that
happens with empires is that

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.919
emperors can do whatever they
damn well please,

00:12:19.919 --> 00:12:22.842
just as czars can,
and you might have had an

00:12:22.842 --> 00:12:27.291
assembly called the Reichstag,
in which socialists became the

00:12:27.291 --> 00:12:32.580
leaders or the most dominant
numerically by 1914,

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:37.080
but power rests in the hands of
a thoroughly irresponsible,

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.309
intellectually lazy,
sort of madcap ridiculous guy

00:12:41.309 --> 00:12:45.250
who happens to be the Kaiser,
William II.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:48.936
Over the long run,
the costs to Europe of that

00:12:48.936 --> 00:12:51.700
fact would be,
in retrospect,

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.379
given what happens in the
twentieth century,

00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:55.080
which is the one that follows
the nineteenth,

00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:00.043
would be one thing that
historians would go back and say

00:13:00.043 --> 00:13:03.745
very obvious things,
sort of clichÃ©s like,

00:13:03.745 --> 00:13:06.812
"Well,
in 1848 history in Germany

00:13:06.812 --> 00:13:11.440
reached its turning point and
failed to turn."

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:16.760
That German unification would
not come because of professors,

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.460
and liberals,
and merchants in Hamburg,

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:23.085
and this sort of thing,
and that the German middle

00:13:23.085 --> 00:13:24.820
classes would,
in a way,

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.386
abdicate their political
responsibility and not having

00:13:27.386 --> 00:13:31.549
much political power,
and the state would be run by a

00:13:31.549 --> 00:13:36.361
bunch of Junkers,
military officers with dueling

00:13:36.361 --> 00:13:41.614
scars and veterans of the
fraternities of the Prussian

00:13:41.614 --> 00:13:43.200
universities.
 

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:50.442
Prussia wasn't just Pomerania
and Brandenburg and the marshes

00:13:50.442 --> 00:13:53.460
of northeastern Europe.
 

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.490
Prussia also controlled the
Rhineland.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:00.854
But the kind of magnates of
industrializing Prussia were not

00:14:00.854 --> 00:14:04.480
going to be the ones who were
running the show.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.649
In the case of Italy,
you can read about that, too,

00:14:07.649 --> 00:14:10.460
is that there were a lot of
people running around saying,

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.580
"Long live united
Italy," and all of this

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.865
business,
but that was to be very hard,

00:14:13.865 --> 00:14:14.000
too.
 

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.038
In order to unify Italy under
any auspices,

00:14:17.038 --> 00:14:20.293
and most people wanted under
liberal auspices,

00:14:20.293 --> 00:14:22.610
you have to get rid of whom?
 

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:23.649
You have to get rid of the
Austrians.

00:14:23.649 --> 00:14:27.787
The Austrians control almost
all of northern Italy and much

00:14:27.787 --> 00:14:29.500
of central Italy,
too.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:34.990
There are lots of impediments
to Italian unification,

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:38.860
not the least of which was the
fact that the vast majority of

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.440
people in Italy did not speak
Italian.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:47.720
That itself was not a major
impediment, but I guess it was,

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.370
too.
 

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:51.224
Only about four or five percent
of the people in Italy spoke

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:53.158
what now is considered to be
Italian,

00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:56.712
which I guess is--I don't speak
Italian--essentially the

00:14:56.712 --> 00:15:00.500
language of Tuscany,
the area around Florence.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.480
They spoke all sorts of other
dialects.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.870
The Tuscan language was
virtually unknown in the south

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.019
of Italy or in Sicily,
and was identified with

00:15:09.019 --> 00:15:12.928
money-grubbing tax collectors
coming down from the north.

00:15:12.928 --> 00:15:18.059
After the tide of the
springtime of the people or,

00:15:18.059 --> 00:15:21.509
as somebody once called it,
"the great illusion"

00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:23.870
of 1848,
after that tide had passed,

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:28.991
what you had is still lots of
fervent hopes and dreams that

00:15:28.991 --> 00:15:33.850
Italy was going to be unified
along liberal auspices.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:37.070
That is what happens,
even though it's a monarchy,

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:41.048
and unification comes because
of basically the expansion of

00:15:41.048 --> 00:15:45.496
the state of Piedmont Sardinia,
which was that most influenced

00:15:45.496 --> 00:15:49.871
by the French wave in the times
of the French Revolution and of

00:15:49.871 --> 00:15:53.163
Napoleon,
and also the wealthiest part of

00:15:53.163 --> 00:15:53.700
Italy.
 

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:58.100
In the case of
Austria-Hungary--this is a long

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.610
story,
and you can read about it--but

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.927
the springtime of the peoples
meant the dreams first of number

00:16:03.927 --> 00:16:06.557
of nationalities,
and I'll talk about nationalism

00:16:06.557 --> 00:16:09.386
in a week or two,
who suddenly think that now

00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:12.528
they, too,
will have their time.

00:16:12.528 --> 00:16:15.604
A bunch of Czech nationalists
were sitting in a room rather

00:16:15.604 --> 00:16:16.240
like this.
 

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.121
Somebody looked up and said,
"Geez, if this ceiling

00:16:19.121 --> 00:16:22.529
collapsed, that's the end of the
Czech national movement."

00:16:22.529 --> 00:16:24.000
There was something to that.
 

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.897
The springtime of the peoples
would not bring an independent

00:16:28.897 --> 00:16:30.058
Czech state.
 

00:16:30.058 --> 00:16:32.748
It wouldn't bring
Czechoslovakia,

00:16:32.748 --> 00:16:37.115
which only lasts until 1993,
despite what John McCain

00:16:37.115 --> 00:16:38.038
thinks.
 

00:16:38.038 --> 00:16:45.370
It doesn't come until 1918,
after World War I.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:48.419
But in the Austrian-Hungarian
empire everybody says,

00:16:48.419 --> 00:16:51.590
"What if we have an
independent Galicia?"

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:56.038
"What if Poland is
independent and the parts of

00:16:56.038 --> 00:17:01.100
Russia and Austria and Poland
will be independent?"

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.269
But these are pipe dreams.
 

00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:07.433
National awareness and great
power politics will mean that

00:17:07.433 --> 00:17:10.430
this isn't going to happen until
later.

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:14.625
Poland becomes independent in
1918, for reasons that you

00:17:14.625 --> 00:17:15.769
already know.
 

00:17:15.769 --> 00:17:20.079
The chill of reaction,
revolution, reaction,

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:23.690
repression is what really
happens.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:27.539
That's the theme running
through the whole thing,

00:17:27.539 --> 00:17:31.230
besides the big hopes of the
spring of 1848.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:38.019
The Austrian imperial system,
and I'll come back and talk

00:17:38.019 --> 00:17:39.980
about Austria-Hungary quite a
bit,

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.779
run in German in the polyglot
Austrian-Hungarian empire,

00:17:43.779 --> 00:17:46.548
where there at least fifteen
major languages,

00:17:46.548 --> 00:17:51.460
will be the story of
Austria-Hungary in the 1850s.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:56.288
Of course, the Hungarians get
separate status,

00:17:56.288 --> 00:18:00.578
equal status in principle,
as of 1867.

00:18:00.578 --> 00:18:05.518
One of the interesting things
about the Austrian-Hungarian

00:18:05.518 --> 00:18:10.977
period is that it's in 1848 that
Franz Joseph becomes emperor of

00:18:10.977 --> 00:18:12.710
Austria-Hungary.
 

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:17.200
He is in power until 1916.
 

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:23.808
He is around even longer than
Queen Victoria.

00:18:23.808 --> 00:18:28.343
The world changes in such
dramatic ways between 1848 and

00:18:28.343 --> 00:18:28.920
1916.
 

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.834
When I was younger than you,
I was in Vienna for the first

00:18:32.834 --> 00:18:36.817
time and I was sitting in a
coffee shop, as one does there,

00:18:36.817 --> 00:18:38.259
in a cafÃ©.
 

00:18:38.259 --> 00:18:40.970
This very old man started
talking to me.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.791
He had actually seen,
when he was young,

00:18:43.791 --> 00:18:45.529
had seen Franz Joseph.
 

00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:47.998
That was the most amazing thing
for me to actually meet somebody

00:18:47.998 --> 00:18:49.212
who had seen,
when he was a boy,

00:18:49.212 --> 00:18:49.880
Franz Joseph.
 

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.390
That's just extraordinary
continuity.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:54.220
Anyway, Austria-Hungary is
another story and it's an

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.220
interesting one.
 

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.298
That we're going to come back
to, but I can't do that now.

00:18:57.298 --> 00:19:01.720
We've got to go back to the
question of England.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:06.595
Another of the legacies of this
is that after this tide of

00:19:06.595 --> 00:19:10.957
reaction what it does is it
sends waves of political

00:19:10.957 --> 00:19:13.778
refugees to places like this.
 

00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:15.548
Not New Haven so much,
but yeah, there were some

00:19:15.548 --> 00:19:17.806
Italians who ended up in New
Haven who were Italian political

00:19:17.806 --> 00:19:18.858
refugees in that period.
 

00:19:18.858 --> 00:19:23.545
But lots of Germans who were
thrown of the German states and

00:19:23.545 --> 00:19:26.588
had better not come back;
they end up where?

00:19:26.588 --> 00:19:28.910
They end up in Philadelphia or
in New York.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.481
Lots of Irish,
who I'm going to talk about in

00:19:31.481 --> 00:19:33.936
a minute, end up in obvious
places--Boston,

00:19:33.936 --> 00:19:37.269
New York, those two above all,
but also Philadelphia.

00:19:37.269 --> 00:19:40.980
The glacial wave of repression
sends these people,

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.858
a lot of them,
to the United States.

00:19:43.858 --> 00:19:46.068
That itself is an interesting
story.

00:19:46.068 --> 00:19:49.203
Although the revolutions of
1848 failed--and you should read

00:19:49.203 --> 00:19:51.736
about that, please do;
I love this stuff,

00:19:51.736 --> 00:19:55.296
talking about this--the
political legacies that they

00:19:55.296 --> 00:19:57.529
left are extremely important.
 

00:19:57.529 --> 00:20:03.633
These demands for political
rights would be something that

00:20:03.633 --> 00:20:07.058
would last for a very long time.
 

00:20:07.058 --> 00:20:09.912
Again,
to repeat and to end this

00:20:09.912 --> 00:20:13.621
little part of what we're
doing--oh my goodness--that

00:20:13.621 --> 00:20:17.758
German unification would come
under very different auspices

00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:21.109
than that of the revolutionaries
of 1848,

00:20:21.109 --> 00:20:22.000
what they wanted.
 

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.160
The King of Prussia rejects
this crown offered from the

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:32.319
gutter, as he called it,
to unify Germany under liberal

00:20:32.319 --> 00:20:34.710
monarchical auspices.
 

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.440
That ain't gonna happen and it
doesn't.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.000
Okay.
 

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.519
There's revolution in all these
places in 1848.

00:20:41.519 --> 00:20:43.410
The big wave.
 

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:47.160
Why not in Britain?
 

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.328
Why not?
 

00:20:48.328 --> 00:20:51.420
You probably already know some
of the answers.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:55.940
There are really two major
contexts in all of this.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:01.526
First is that the Reform Act of
1832 puts down the drawbridge

00:21:01.526 --> 00:21:04.319
and opens it to more voters.
 

00:21:04.319 --> 00:21:06.440
More people can vote now.
 

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:14.170
Again, voting was based on
property qualification.

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:19.971
Feargus O'Connor,
who is an Irish Chartist whom

00:21:19.971 --> 00:21:25.713
I'll talk about in a minute,
he didn't even have the right

00:21:25.713 --> 00:21:29.417
to--he is not disbarred,
but he's thrown out of

00:21:29.417 --> 00:21:33.262
parliament because he doesn't
make enough money in order to

00:21:33.262 --> 00:21:35.650
actually qualify to vote
himself.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:41.163
You could vote if you paid X
number of pounds and shillings

00:21:41.163 --> 00:21:42.210
in taxes.
 

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:47.123
What happens is 1832 opens up
the drawbridge and more people

00:21:47.123 --> 00:21:48.038
can vote.
 

00:21:48.038 --> 00:21:51.824
The political arena expands a
little bit and the same thing

00:21:51.824 --> 00:21:54.500
happens in France in 1830,
as you know.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.258
In France the revolution of
1830 doubled the number of

00:21:57.258 --> 00:21:58.558
people that could vote.
 

00:21:58.558 --> 00:22:01.720
But it still leaves people on
the outside looking in.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.693
In 1867 they would pass a
second reform bill that lets

00:22:05.693 --> 00:22:06.970
more people in.
 

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.951
In 1884 they pass another one
that lets almost everybody in

00:22:10.951 --> 00:22:14.180
except for, I think,
domestic servants and maybe

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.759
rural proletarians.
 

00:22:15.759 --> 00:22:17.118
I can't remember exactly.
 

00:22:17.118 --> 00:22:20.078
The political arena is
expanding.

00:22:20.078 --> 00:22:24.680
The point of this is it's
expanding through reform.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:28.130
Britain reforms.
 

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:33.132
The self-image,
the self-identity of the

00:22:33.132 --> 00:22:37.380
freeborn Englishman,
tracing more or less,

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:41.529
at least in the imaginary,
antecedents back to June 15,

00:22:41.529 --> 00:22:45.400
1215 at Runnymede near London.
 

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:50.807
The idea that the freeborn
Englishman has rights and that

00:22:50.807 --> 00:22:55.539
we British citizens,
our identity is we reform.

00:22:55.539 --> 00:22:58.529
We don't rebel.
 

00:22:58.529 --> 00:23:02.112
Clearly, as I will demonstrate
in a minute drawing on the work

00:23:02.112 --> 00:23:04.519
of John Belcher and other
people, too,

00:23:04.519 --> 00:23:09.833
what happens in 1848 is when
there might have been a

00:23:09.833 --> 00:23:15.063
revolutionary moment in Britain,
"France has sneezed and

00:23:15.063 --> 00:23:18.458
Europe is catching a cold,"
as they like to say over and

00:23:18.458 --> 00:23:19.250
over again.
 

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:22.828
It doesn't come to Britain.
 

00:23:22.828 --> 00:23:28.344
British national identity,
like all national identities,

00:23:28.344 --> 00:23:34.058
have to be systematically
reinvented and reconstructed.

00:23:34.058 --> 00:23:38.849
This happens in 1848 and
subsequent years as well,

00:23:38.849 --> 00:23:42.368
the sense that we are
respectable.

00:23:42.368 --> 00:23:44.513
I've written
"respectability"

00:23:44.513 --> 00:23:45.529
up on the board.
 

00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:53.079
Respectability means reform and
not revolution.

00:23:53.079 --> 00:23:57.958
The aristocracy of labor,
who were craftsmen and artisans

00:23:57.958 --> 00:24:02.759
who could be seen walking
through Hyde Park with their

00:24:02.759 --> 00:24:07.199
ladies on their arms wearing
suits, of all things,

00:24:07.199 --> 00:24:12.313
on Sundays,
the bourgeois respectability

00:24:12.313 --> 00:24:16.779
had a political aspect of it,
too.

00:24:16.779 --> 00:24:23.190
In 1848 Britain does not rebel.
 

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:25.308
More about this in a minute.
 

00:24:25.308 --> 00:24:30.528
The other context is Chartism,
which you should read about.

00:24:30.528 --> 00:24:35.751
Chartist campaigns were
campaigns to get ordinary people

00:24:35.751 --> 00:24:42.019
to sign an enormous charter with
millions and millions of names.

00:24:42.019 --> 00:24:45.108
There's two big waves in the
1830s and 1840s.

00:24:45.108 --> 00:24:47.650
What they do is they sign and
they say,

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:51.920
"We the humble poor,
we ordinary people,

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.519
we entreat you,
big time lords,

00:24:55.519 --> 00:24:59.607
property owners of great
distinction who are representing

00:24:59.607 --> 00:25:03.002
property and parliament,
we entreat you to give us

00:25:03.002 --> 00:25:04.368
political rights."
 

00:25:04.368 --> 00:25:08.848
They bring these huge petitions
in on wagons signed by zillions

00:25:08.848 --> 00:25:13.183
of people, many of whom can only
mark an X instead of writing

00:25:13.183 --> 00:25:14.338
their names.
 

00:25:14.338 --> 00:25:18.588
They bring them to parliament
in the rain, as always.

00:25:18.588 --> 00:25:20.500
Parliament says,
"Gee, thanks a lot.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.509
We don't want to see that."
 

00:25:22.509 --> 00:25:24.420
Then they say,
"Oh, we'll do it again.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.960
O great lords,
give us political rights."

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.450
They sign.
 

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:30.988
They don't pick up their
blunderbusses,

00:25:30.988 --> 00:25:31.788
they sign.
 

00:25:31.788 --> 00:25:34.924
In 1830 the French middle class
was more than happy to turn

00:25:34.924 --> 00:25:37.952
their artisans loose on the
street to fight their battles

00:25:37.952 --> 00:25:39.789
for them for political reform.
 

00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:42.592
In Delacroix's famous painting,
Liberty Leads the

00:25:42.592 --> 00:25:45.798
People,
the bourgeois with his top hat,

00:25:45.798 --> 00:25:51.660
in this romantic picture
romanticized view of revolution,

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:55.642
does not have any place there,
because the bourgeoisie does

00:25:55.642 --> 00:25:58.015
not fight,
unless you consider master

00:25:58.015 --> 00:25:59.710
artisans petty bourgeois.
 

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:01.940
But in England that's never
going to happen.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:05.608
The Chartist campaign remains
respectable.

00:26:05.608 --> 00:26:10.582
It is class-based to the extent
that most people who signed the

00:26:10.582 --> 00:26:13.868
chartist petitions are ordinary
people.

00:26:13.868 --> 00:26:17.430
But really they saw themselves
as moral reformers.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:20.403
They see themselves as trying
to do--and it cuts across class

00:26:20.403 --> 00:26:20.798
lines.
 

00:26:20.798 --> 00:26:24.413
They're trying to get the
government to do the right

00:26:24.413 --> 00:26:26.538
thing, to pass more reforms.
 

00:26:26.538 --> 00:26:29.886
The Reform Act of 1832 was
passed by a conservative

00:26:29.886 --> 00:26:33.836
government because they knew
that inevitably it was going to

00:26:33.836 --> 00:26:35.309
have to be passed.
 

00:26:35.309 --> 00:26:36.490
Who knows?
 

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:39.621
It would create more lords in
order to--and you'd have these

00:26:39.621 --> 00:26:42.538
not real lords who are there so
the bill gets passed.

00:26:42.538 --> 00:26:44.730
It's passed by a conservative
government.

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.465
Then everybody says,
"We British,

00:26:46.465 --> 00:26:47.029
we reform.
 

00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:48.779
We've opened up the drawbridge.
 

00:26:48.779 --> 00:26:50.140
More people can vote."
 

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:53.102
There was a component of
Chartists who were called

00:26:53.102 --> 00:26:55.460
"physical force"
Chartists.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:27:00.848
They're not so sure that reform
without revolution is possible.

00:27:00.848 --> 00:27:05.269
They are a minority within the
Chartist movement.

00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:09.778
They are a very small minority,
the physical force Chartists.

00:27:09.778 --> 00:27:14.944
What you've got in 1848 is
you've got two things that are

00:27:14.944 --> 00:27:15.960
going on.
 

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.450
First of all,
you don't have a revolution.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:22.152
There's this big date in April,
I think it's April 10^(th),

00:27:22.152 --> 00:27:25.598
where there's going to be this
huge march in London.

00:27:25.598 --> 00:27:30.865
What the government does is it
deputizes 25,000 men of

00:27:30.865 --> 00:27:31.960
property.
 

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.890
They become sheriffs.
 

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:35.000
They become--I don't know what
you call them,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:35.960
sheriffs, I guess.
 

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.544
Louis Napoleon Bonaparte,
who had not yet returned to

00:27:39.544 --> 00:27:43.541
France, he was one of those who
was actually deputized as a

00:27:43.541 --> 00:27:44.368
sheriff.
 

00:27:44.368 --> 00:27:46.650
The business people in the
City,

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:49.690
which is what the financial
capital that overlooks the

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:52.098
British Empire was increasingly
called,

00:27:52.098 --> 00:27:55.430
they come with their hunting
rifles to work.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:59.269
They get those file cabinets
ready to barricade the door.

00:27:59.269 --> 00:28:06.159
And with their rifles they're
going to blow apart anybody who

00:28:06.159 --> 00:28:12.588
rises up and would try to bring
revolution to Britain.

00:28:12.588 --> 00:28:15.220
There are 25,000 of these
people.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:18.430
The number of marchers was far,
far smaller to that.

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:20.940
It's a very peaceful march.
 

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:25.640
There is no revolution in
Britain in 1848.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.490
But if there had been a
revolution, where would it come

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:29.990
from?
 

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:34.848
From where would the
revolutionary ranks have come?

00:28:34.848 --> 00:28:36.808
That is the interesting
question.

00:28:36.808 --> 00:28:38.933
That's by far the most
interesting question in all of

00:28:38.933 --> 00:28:39.220
this.
 

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:44.904
Because of what I said before,
1848 helps the British

00:28:44.904 --> 00:28:50.920
re-invent or reconfigure,
reconstruct their identity.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:55.855
There has to be an unwanted
Other there who's frightening

00:28:55.855 --> 00:29:01.232
them, who makes them convinced
even more that they're doing it

00:29:01.232 --> 00:29:02.819
the right way.
 

00:29:02.819 --> 00:29:06.064
I alluded before,
when we talked about British

00:29:06.064 --> 00:29:08.210
identity in the eighteenth
century,

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:12.698
I said what the British weren't
in the seventeenth century

00:29:12.698 --> 00:29:16.318
helped determine who they
thought they were.

00:29:16.318 --> 00:29:19.960
What they weren't were
absolutists.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.759
They reformed.
 

00:29:21.759 --> 00:29:26.519
What they weren't was Catholic.
 

00:29:26.519 --> 00:29:29.298
The biggest riots in the
eighteenth century were the

00:29:29.298 --> 00:29:31.858
Gordon riots,
which were anti-Catholic riots.

00:29:31.858 --> 00:29:35.380
They are not the French,
not at all.

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:40.730
France has a centralized state
and France is full of Catholics.

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:45.577
Many of the Protestants who had
left France after the revocation

00:29:45.577 --> 00:29:48.579
of the Edict of Nantes in 1685
come,

00:29:48.579 --> 00:29:55.279
not just to the Netherlands,
but come to Britain as well.

00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:59.471
So, this may have already
tipped you off on who is the

00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:02.130
unwanted,
dangerous Other in the

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:04.930
British--particularly
upper-class,

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:08.470
but not just
upper-class--imaginary.

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:13.118
They are the Irish.
 

00:30:13.118 --> 00:30:18.269
What happens in 1848 and the
subsequent years is that British

00:30:18.269 --> 00:30:23.334
nationalism is redefined again
or re-infused with a sense of

00:30:23.334 --> 00:30:28.313
"what we are not,"
and we are not Catholic and we

00:30:28.313 --> 00:30:30.028
are not Irish.
 

00:30:30.028 --> 00:30:36.138
If there was going to be a
revolution in April or any other

00:30:36.138 --> 00:30:39.910
month in 1848,
the components would be,

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:44.267
from the point of view of the
upper classes and from the

00:30:44.267 --> 00:30:48.567
police,
the Irish and groups of

00:30:48.567 --> 00:30:57.263
physical force Chartists or
revolutionaries who might join

00:30:57.263 --> 00:30:58.788
forces.
 

00:30:58.788 --> 00:31:03.384
Chartists looked to the Irish
to get them to sign the big

00:31:03.384 --> 00:31:04.369
petitions.
 

00:31:04.369 --> 00:31:06.460
They see them as allies.
 

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:12.248
Remember, because of the Irish
potato famine in the 1840s that

00:31:12.248 --> 00:31:16.798
tens of thousands of Irishmen,
hundreds of thousands of

00:31:16.798 --> 00:31:19.400
Irishmen--I have it in the book
somewhere,

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.786
but the number of people who
leave Ireland in the 1840s is in

00:31:22.786 --> 00:31:26.268
the millions,
along with all those who just

00:31:26.268 --> 00:31:28.579
simply die in the fields.
 

00:31:28.579 --> 00:31:29.630
They go to where?
 

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:33.943
They go to the United States
and they go to England,

00:31:33.943 --> 00:31:36.058
particularly Liverpool.
 

00:31:36.058 --> 00:31:39.759
That's why the Liverpool--this
has nothing to do with anything,

00:31:39.759 --> 00:31:43.455
Ã§a na rien Ã 
voir avec--soccer team is

00:31:43.455 --> 00:31:47.025
very much perceived as a
Catholic team in the way that in

00:31:47.025 --> 00:31:50.338
Glasgow that the Celtics are the
Catholic team,

00:31:50.338 --> 00:31:53.980
because so many Irish
immigrants went to Glasgow and

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:54.980
to Scotland.
 

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:58.660
The Rangers are the Protestant
team, very anti-Catholic.

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.250
That's why these people were
brawling in 1900.

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:04.060
They played before 100,000
people in 1900--one hundred

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.660
thousand people at a soccer game
in about 1900.

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.769
They hate each other's guts and
they still do.

00:32:08.769 --> 00:32:11.940
All of these Irish are going to
London, also.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:15.058
They live in the Irish
neighborhoods.

00:32:15.058 --> 00:32:18.240
From the point of view of the
ruling classes,

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.880
and from the point of view of
British nationalism,

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.509
and from the point of view of
the police,

00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:27.160
the possibility was there that
the Irish confederation,

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:31.609
who are extremely militant--one
of the important Irish leaders,

00:32:31.609 --> 00:32:37.009
Daniel O'Connell,
who is in the book,

00:32:37.009 --> 00:32:39.180
he dies in 1847.
 

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:42.690
But you've got these people who
are far more militant.

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:47.875
Many of them believe that the
only way Ireland is ever going

00:32:47.875 --> 00:32:52.269
to be independent is by rising
up and rebelling.

00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:53.230
That's what happens, isn't it?
 

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:55.660
That's what eventually happens.
 

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:57.630
They were right about that.
 

00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:00.819
What if they start rebelling in
1848?

00:33:00.819 --> 00:33:04.950
What if you had, for example,
your basic Peterloo massacre,

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.751
as they called it,
playing on the word

00:33:07.751 --> 00:33:12.105
"Waterloo,"
where the British troops shoot

00:33:12.105 --> 00:33:16.289
down well-dressed demonstrators
in Manchester.

00:33:16.289 --> 00:33:17.858
What is it, 1817?
 

00:33:17.858 --> 00:33:20.819
Either 1816 or 1817,
I don't remember.

00:33:20.819 --> 00:33:24.874
What if people who said,
"We're never going to get

00:33:24.874 --> 00:33:29.000
anywhere if we don't do what our
French colleagues have done,

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.680
and that is take arms against
these people."

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:36.614
So, there is a potential for an
alliance between militants in

00:33:36.614 --> 00:33:41.220
the physical force Chartist
movement, other radicals,

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:44.730
and members of the Irish
confederation.

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:48.053
Because it never happens,
there are a few marches and a

00:33:48.053 --> 00:33:51.332
few skirmishes,
but basically the only news is

00:33:51.332 --> 00:33:54.439
no news,
does not mean that this

00:33:54.439 --> 00:33:59.986
wouldn't have a big effect on
the reinvention of British

00:33:59.986 --> 00:34:03.650
nationalism,
British self-identity.

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:06.858
What do I mean by that?
 

00:34:06.858 --> 00:34:09.844
Here, one of the interesting
things is that John Belcher told

00:34:09.844 --> 00:34:13.088
me a long time ago,
on a train in Germany coming

00:34:13.088 --> 00:34:15.929
back from a conference in
Wurzburg,

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:20.929
that there were more boxes of
documents in the public record

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:26.097
office about the surveillance of
ships coming into the port of

00:34:26.097 --> 00:34:28.896
Liverpool,
than there were any other

00:34:28.896 --> 00:34:31.460
documents about any other aspect
of 1848.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:32.650
Why?
 

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:34.250
What are they doing?
 

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:38.090
Where is the potential
insurgency or infusion of

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:40.869
militants for Irish coming from?
 

00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:43.449
It's coming from the United
States.

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:45.590
One of the interesting things
about this,

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:49.068
and you can see also in the
time of the troubles in the

00:34:49.068 --> 00:34:51.579
1970s--I was in Ireland,
ironically,

00:34:51.579 --> 00:34:54.670
when it all started up again in
1969.

00:34:54.670 --> 00:35:00.213
At the time they were really
worried about the IRA,

00:35:00.213 --> 00:35:04.869
and there was a lot to worry
about then.

00:35:04.869 --> 00:35:09.563
The IRA was getting all sorts
of money from Irish pubs in New

00:35:09.563 --> 00:35:12.302
York and Boston,
just tons of money,

00:35:12.302 --> 00:35:15.590
big bucks all the time to buy
weapons.

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:18.766
In 1848, one of the interesting
things that Belcher and other

00:35:18.766 --> 00:35:21.889
people have discovered is that
the real Irish militants,

00:35:21.889 --> 00:35:26.239
the most committed,
were Irish immigrants,

00:35:26.239 --> 00:35:30.467
immigrants to and immigrants
from Ireland living in Boston

00:35:30.467 --> 00:35:31.579
and New York.
 

00:35:31.579 --> 00:35:34.965
What they had done is taken the
notion of "American

00:35:34.965 --> 00:35:37.550
liberty"
and said, "All right.

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:40.110
Our role will be that of the
French Revolution,

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:43.228
to carry liberty in principle
across the borders and free

00:35:43.228 --> 00:35:45.009
Europe from nobles,
from priests,

00:35:45.009 --> 00:35:45.900
etc., etc.
 

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:50.217
What we will do,
as first generation Irish

00:35:50.217 --> 00:35:52.936
living in New York,
and Philadelphia,

00:35:52.936 --> 00:35:55.489
and Boston,
and maybe Connecticut, too,

00:35:55.489 --> 00:36:03.389
is we will raise money and we
will make Irish independence.

00:36:03.389 --> 00:36:07.730
We will achieve this with
violence, with guns."

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:14.590
Every ship that came into any
port that was coming from the

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:21.215
United States was thoroughly
searched for weapons and for

00:36:21.215 --> 00:36:22.400
money.
 

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:28.460
These Irish immigrants to the
United States were the most

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:33.331
militant, arguably,
within the Irish political

00:36:33.331 --> 00:36:36.579
movement for independence.
 

00:36:36.579 --> 00:36:39.159
For one thing,
they had more means.

00:36:39.159 --> 00:36:42.168
Some of them had come from
Ireland to the United States

00:36:42.168 --> 00:36:44.619
maybe going through England and
maybe not.

00:36:44.619 --> 00:36:46.420
They had jobs,
and the people in Ireland

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.900
themselves were just starving.
 

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.469
They were dying in the fields.
 

00:36:49.469 --> 00:36:53.818
They were ending up in London
living with other Irishmen,

00:36:53.818 --> 00:36:57.701
which is not surprising,
maintaining these kinds of

00:36:57.701 --> 00:37:01.039
patterns by county,
Cork, and all this.

00:37:01.039 --> 00:37:06.471
The Catholic Church was
terribly, terribly important in

00:37:06.471 --> 00:37:07.880
their lives.
 

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:11.110
It was terribly important as a
means of charity and all this.

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:15.208
But what it meant for the upper
classes is that the unwanted

00:37:15.208 --> 00:37:19.375
Other, Catholic--remember in
1798 they tried to ally with the

00:37:19.375 --> 00:37:20.139
French.
 

00:37:20.139 --> 00:37:22.170
What happens in World War I?
 

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:25.275
Roger Casement,
who is an Irish militant who is

00:37:25.275 --> 00:37:28.802
absolutely against the
exploitation of workers in Peru,

00:37:28.802 --> 00:37:31.070
and in Africa,
and in everywhere else,

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:35.777
Roger Casement ends up being
sent off with a little boat off

00:37:35.777 --> 00:37:38.969
of a submarine off the coast of
Carey.

00:37:38.969 --> 00:37:41.449
He tries to stop the Easter
Insurrection.

00:37:41.449 --> 00:37:44.721
Of course, he's arrested within
about twenty-five minutes and

00:37:44.721 --> 00:37:45.429
hung later.
 

00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:49.922
What he tried to do was
organize, in prisoner of war

00:37:49.922 --> 00:37:53.885
camps in Germany,
Irish militants to fight the

00:37:53.885 --> 00:37:56.969
good fight and to free Ireland.
 

00:37:56.969 --> 00:38:00.737
This is looking later,
but there was always this

00:38:00.737 --> 00:38:04.231
potential fear among the British
upper classes that they--these

00:38:04.231 --> 00:38:07.329
Catholics who are no longer just
across the channel.

00:38:07.329 --> 00:38:11.538
They're not over in Ireland
across a very choppy,

00:38:11.538 --> 00:38:13.380
gray, freezing sea.
 

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:17.010
They are living in Liverpool in
huge numbers.

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:20.869
They are living in London in
even bigger numbers.

00:38:20.869 --> 00:38:21.780
They are there.
 

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.059
They are dangerous.
 

00:38:23.059 --> 00:38:27.579
If they ally with these
dissatisfied workers from the

00:38:27.579 --> 00:38:32.099
Chartist movement,
all hell is going to break out.

00:38:32.099 --> 00:38:36.440
During the next time,
and I don't have much time at

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:41.389
all--and I didn't even use this,
but you see the point.

00:38:41.389 --> 00:38:44.469
This potential alliance never
occurs,

00:38:44.469 --> 00:38:49.364
but one of the interesting
things about the re-invention or

00:38:49.364 --> 00:38:52.909
the reconstruction of British
identity,

00:38:52.909 --> 00:38:56.784
self-identity--and it's one
shared not just by nobles and

00:38:56.784 --> 00:38:59.760
big time gentry but by ordinary
workers,

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.632
"Tory workers,"
we tended to call them

00:39:01.632 --> 00:39:04.273
dismissively,
those of us who couldn't stand

00:39:04.273 --> 00:39:07.817
Margaret Thatcher and always
were amazed to go through

00:39:07.817 --> 00:39:11.893
working-class parts of Britain
and see these miserable council

00:39:11.893 --> 00:39:15.702
houses with these big pictures
of Margaret Thatcher or the

00:39:15.702 --> 00:39:17.039
royal family.
 

00:39:17.039 --> 00:39:19.099
Anyway, it's just amazing.
 

00:39:19.099 --> 00:39:22.010
But these Tory workers,
and not just Tory workers,

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:24.210
they see themselves as
respectable.

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:29.119
They see themselves as British
and they increasingly see this

00:39:29.119 --> 00:39:32.719
unwanted enemy within,
Catholic enemy within,

00:39:32.719 --> 00:39:34.110
as the Irish.
 

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:39.599
The newspapers are full of
cartoons and caricatures of the

00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:44.029
Irish, who are portrayed
invariably as drunken,

00:39:44.029 --> 00:39:46.630
as stupid, and as lazy.
 

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:52.601
"Paddy" becomes,
for the caricaturists in

00:39:52.601 --> 00:39:58.393
British newspapers in 1848 and
subsequent years--Paddy is

00:39:58.393 --> 00:40:04.597
portrayed as the unwanted Other
who is a threat to and has no

00:40:04.597 --> 00:40:09.481
place being in,
except to do menial jobs or as

00:40:09.481 --> 00:40:14.541
a factory operative if they
maintained respectability and

00:40:14.541 --> 00:40:18.789
don't try trod out their
Irishness too much.

00:40:18.789 --> 00:40:21.463
So, if anyone wants to know why
these issues become so

00:40:21.463 --> 00:40:24.590
extraordinarily bitter at almost
any time you can think of,

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:31.059
Ulster in the 1970s and 1980s
or even into the 1990s,

00:40:31.059 --> 00:40:37.199
or Ireland in 1916,
1848 plays a major role in that.

00:40:37.199 --> 00:40:41.291
Now, this is not to say that
all people who saw themselves as

00:40:41.291 --> 00:40:44.840
British were necessarily nasty,
aggressive people.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.500
But it does simply remind us,
and here again I counsel Linda

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.018
Colley's book called
Britain,

00:40:50.018 --> 00:40:55.119
as a very eloquent summary of
all of this,

00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:57.639
that part of the construction
of any kind of identity,

00:40:57.639 --> 00:40:59.929
and I'll talk more about this
when I talk about Eastern and

00:40:59.929 --> 00:41:02.389
Central Europe,
is what you're not,

00:41:02.389 --> 00:41:06.407
and what you're not for the
British in 1848--afraid of

00:41:06.407 --> 00:41:10.045
catching this cold coming from
the continent was,

00:41:10.045 --> 00:41:12.829
again,
you are not French.

00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:14.329
You are not Catholic.
 

00:41:14.329 --> 00:41:17.610
This, if anything,
was going to further sour the

00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:21.170
relations between Irish and
British authorities,

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:24.469
particularly given the fact
that the British Protestants

00:41:24.469 --> 00:41:26.150
owned the land in Ireland.
 

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:29.090
I was in New York the other
day,

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:32.237
and I heard a talk and I saw
some pictures of these marvelous

00:41:32.237 --> 00:41:34.858
things called "mass
slabs," or "mass

00:41:34.858 --> 00:41:37.219
rocks," that were in rural
Ireland,

00:41:37.219 --> 00:41:41.230
where priests in the sixteenth,
seventeenth,

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:47.699
and eighteenth centuries said
mass in secret using these slab

00:41:47.699 --> 00:41:50.454
rocks,
rocks that they happened to

00:41:50.454 --> 00:41:51.579
find, as altars.
 

00:41:51.579 --> 00:41:56.059
Practicing your religion was
illegal, and the Protestants

00:41:56.059 --> 00:42:00.699
have the law on their side and
they own the land anyway.

00:42:00.699 --> 00:42:05.360
So, in 1848 there was no
revolution in Britain.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.119
You know clearly why this is
not the case.

00:42:08.119 --> 00:42:11.539
It's almost surprising to think
that they could have imagined

00:42:11.539 --> 00:42:14.730
the lines between the Irish
confederation and other Irish

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:17.010
groups and physical force
Chartists.

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:25.099
But 1848 has another role to
play in British identity.

00:42:25.099 --> 00:42:26.610
I've tried to convey that to
you today.

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:27.400
Have a wonderful weekend.
 

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.130
See you on Monday.
 

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:28.199
Bye.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.986
Prof: Okay.
 

00:00:02.986 --> 00:00:06.547
Well, last time we looked at
the early Tudors reestablishing

00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:10.303
the authority of the monarchy,
and now we turn towards what

00:00:10.303 --> 00:00:13.651
was to prove one of the biggest
problems for most of the

00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:16.511
sixteenth century:
the question of the authority

00:00:16.511 --> 00:00:19.980
of the church and of the nature
of English religion.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.740
Let's start by taking you to a
couple of places.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.960
A few miles north of the city
of Cambridge in the Fenlands--

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.840
the flatlands stretching up
to--towards--

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.890
the sea, here lies the small
city of Ely,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.610
which has one of the greatest
of English cathedrals in it.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.694
Ely Cathedral dates back to the
twelfth century and when you go

00:00:44.694 --> 00:00:49.040
there the main nave of the
cathedral is of magnificent

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.250
Norman architecture,
but rather gloomy.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.179
But at the bottom of the nave
there's a little door which

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.010
leads through to the Lady
Chapel.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.758
And if you go through there you
get struck almost immediately by

00:01:02.758 --> 00:01:04.188
a dazzling light.
 

00:01:04.188 --> 00:01:07.165
You find yourself in a
beautiful chapel,

00:01:07.165 --> 00:01:10.829
late medieval chapel,
with vast windows glazed in

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.569
clear glass with the light
streaming through.

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:18.188
On a sunny day it's quite an
astonishing contrast.

00:01:18.188 --> 00:01:22.292
And it's only when your eyes
get used to the light that you

00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:26.748
notice that in the stone tracery
of the windows there are niches

00:01:26.748 --> 00:01:28.799
where once statues stood.
 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.736
Some of them are still there
with the heads broken off or

00:01:31.736 --> 00:01:33.519
half the statute is still there.
 

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:37.882
And here and there in the white
glass of the windows you see a

00:01:37.882 --> 00:01:42.388
little bit of stained glass that
they found and replaced in what

00:01:42.388 --> 00:01:46.180
were once windows full of
stained-glass pictures.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.000
So that's Ely Cathedral.
 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.089
And if you go a couple of
hundred miles north to North

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:54.062
Yorkshire there's a little
church there called Saint

00:01:54.062 --> 00:01:55.170
Agatha's Easby.
 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.724
It lies by the river,
not far from the town of

00:01:57.724 --> 00:02:00.450
Richmond, which I was talking
about last week.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.009
And at Easby there's a tiny
twelfth-century church,

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.218
Saint Agatha's.
 

00:02:05.218 --> 00:02:11.401
The windows are very small and
when you go in it's exceedingly

00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:12.008
dim.
 

00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:15.873
But again when your eyes adjust
to the light you notice on the

00:02:15.873 --> 00:02:19.929
walls faded wall paintings which
were probably put there sometime

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:22.210
early in the thirteenth century.
 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.598
There's Adam and Eve.
 

00:02:23.598 --> 00:02:27.336
There's the nativity,
a very nice nativity scene with

00:02:27.336 --> 00:02:30.687
a very sweet donkey,
and so the story continues

00:02:30.687 --> 00:02:33.169
'round the walls to the
crucifixion,

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:36.229
the resurrection.
 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:42.532
And in the spaces left by the
main paintings there are little

00:02:42.532 --> 00:02:47.364
portrayals of medieval peasants
at work sowing,

00:02:47.364 --> 00:02:49.990
plowing and so forth.
 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.305
And outside by the river are
the ruins of Easby Abbey,

00:02:54.305 --> 00:02:58.539
which was quite near the Church
of Saint Agatha's.

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:59.430
Okay.
 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.378
Well, we can use those two
places to symbolize the way that

00:03:03.378 --> 00:03:06.852
the Protestant Reformation has
been presented in the

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:09.780
historiography of early modern
England.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.925
To some people it was,
as it were, a flood of light:

00:03:15.925 --> 00:03:19.782
purifying, bracing,
invigorating,

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:21.590
liberating.
 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.348
On the other hand,
other historians have greater

00:03:25.348 --> 00:03:29.669
sympathy for the religious
culture represented by those

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:34.068
faded wall paintings in the
church at Easby or the empty

00:03:34.068 --> 00:03:38.150
niches in the windows at Ely
Cathedral or the ruined

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.470
monastery by the river,
Easby Abbey.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.936
They have a greater sense of
what was lost,

00:03:45.936 --> 00:03:50.888
of the destruction of a great
deal of beauty in the course of

00:03:50.888 --> 00:03:53.530
the zeal of the reformation.
 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.978
Well, prior to the 1980s one
could say in general that it was

00:03:56.978 --> 00:04:00.598
the first approach which tended
to be the dominant tradition.

00:04:00.598 --> 00:04:04.210
The reformation was generally
seen as being positive.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.961
As Christopher Marsh puts it,
it "had purpose,

00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:11.788
direction and also a certain
inevitability."

00:04:11.788 --> 00:04:15.500
Nowadays the dominant trend is
rather in the other direction.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.132
It tends to stress the
destruction of the older

00:04:19.132 --> 00:04:22.204
religious tradition,
a destruction which,

00:04:22.204 --> 00:04:25.898
to quote Marsh again,
was "regrettable,

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:29.269
undesired and
undesirable."

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:32.538
So as a result we now have a
much more two-dimensional

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:34.759
historiography of the
reformation.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.639
And that's a good thing.
 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.666
History should involve critical
examination rather than mere

00:04:41.666 --> 00:04:44.819
celebration or
self-congratulation.

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.769
But if we have a more
two-dimensional picture,

00:04:47.769 --> 00:04:51.538
one which includes not only the
reformers and the victors but

00:04:51.538 --> 00:04:54.430
also those who resisted and
those who lost,

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.120
it's still not exactly even
handed,

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.519
and historians inevitably have
their preferences.

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:04.504
They tend to lean one way or
the other, and this whole story

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:08.899
is one which still engages a
good deal of passion.

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:12.559
Well, today I want to start
approaching all of that by

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:16.564
considering the nature of the
old religion and the state of

00:05:16.564 --> 00:05:19.810
the pre-reformation church:
its strengths,

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.274
its weaknesses,
and those who were already

00:05:24.274 --> 00:05:28.740
there criticizing some of its
features.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.281
And that will help us to begin
consideration of how it was

00:05:34.281 --> 00:05:39.629
possible in only a few years to
bring this great edifice

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:41.379
crashing down.
 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:44.458
At the beginning of the
sixteenth century,

00:05:44.458 --> 00:05:48.812
the church was of course the
greatest corporate institution

00:05:48.812 --> 00:05:50.240
in the kingdom.
 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.920
It was the English branch of a
great international institution

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.762
which gave Western Europe its
identity, collectively,

00:06:00.762 --> 00:06:03.370
as Catholic Christendom.
 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.180
The church in England--of
course, there wasn't a Church of

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.666
England yet--
the church in England was

00:06:08.666 --> 00:06:12.721
organized into two provinces
with archbishops at Canterbury

00:06:12.721 --> 00:06:15.170
and York,
and then there were twenty-one

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.329
diocese each of them headed by a
bishop,

00:06:17.329 --> 00:06:22.226
and beneath that archdeaconries
and deaneries and so on down to

00:06:22.226 --> 00:06:26.331
somewhat more than 9,000
parishes at most local level

00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:28.860
each with its parish church.
 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.946
And in addition scattered
around the landscape but

00:06:31.946 --> 00:06:35.661
particularly concentrated in
parts of the north and the west

00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:38.560
were the great monasteries and
nunneries,

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.459
some 750 of them in all.
 

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:48.341
The clergy who staffed this
institution were a distinct

00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:51.360
estate of the realm as you
already know.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.610
Attempts have been made to
estimate their numbers.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.170
It's been estimated about
60,000 in all,

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.476
which would mean that the
clergy comprised about four

00:07:01.476 --> 00:07:04.528
percent of the entire national
population or,

00:07:04.528 --> 00:07:08.276
since most of them were men,
something like eight percent of

00:07:08.276 --> 00:07:13.500
the entire male population;
a very large presence.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.232
Members of the clergy enjoyed a
privileged position before the

00:07:17.232 --> 00:07:17.600
law.
 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.915
They were dealt with in the
church courts in the first

00:07:19.915 --> 00:07:22.197
instance,
though they could sometimes be

00:07:22.197 --> 00:07:25.069
handed over to the secular
authorities if they had

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:28.201
committed crimes,
and they were supported by a

00:07:28.201 --> 00:07:31.189
variety of fees and dues paid to
them and,

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:34.718
in particular tithes,
by which people gave a tenth of

00:07:34.718 --> 00:07:38.790
their income or produce for the
maintenance of the church.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.132
And then of course there were
the great endowments given to

00:07:42.132 --> 00:07:44.610
the church by pious members of
the laity.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.889
So it was a great institution,
a wealthy institution,

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:51.399
the owner of a great deal of
land and property,

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:55.725
but also a collection of more
than 9,000 small Christian

00:07:55.725 --> 00:08:00.286
communities periodically united
in their parish churches in

00:08:00.286 --> 00:08:03.271
worship,
in the practice of their

00:08:03.271 --> 00:08:04.088
religion.
 

00:08:04.088 --> 00:08:08.634
And in considering the old
religion and its nature we

00:08:08.634 --> 00:08:13.966
should perhaps start there with
the fundamentals of the nature

00:08:13.966 --> 00:08:17.550
and characteristics of the old
faith.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:22.670
Well, the central doctrines can
be covered briefly.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.670
They were as follows:
Christ's sacrifice on the cross

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:31.670
had made salvation available to
sinful humankind through grace;

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.990
divine favor.
 

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:37.024
Access to grace,
the means of salvation,

00:08:37.024 --> 00:08:41.072
was made available through the
church and through its

00:08:41.072 --> 00:08:42.240
sacraments.
 

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.173
Membership of the church was
gained through the sacrament of

00:08:45.173 --> 00:08:47.659
baptism,
usually in infancy of course,

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:51.405
and it was demonstrated by
continued participation in the

00:08:51.405 --> 00:08:54.342
sacraments,
especially the mass when

00:08:54.342 --> 00:08:59.418
elements of bread and wine were
consecrated and transformed into

00:08:59.418 --> 00:09:03.446
the body and blood of Christ
through the miracle of

00:09:03.446 --> 00:09:05.379
transubstantiation.
 

00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:08.408
The Christian life involved
obedience to the Ten

00:09:08.408 --> 00:09:11.437
Commandments,
avoidance of the seven deadly

00:09:11.437 --> 00:09:13.528
sins,
participation in the

00:09:13.528 --> 00:09:17.389
sacraments, the doing of good
works and prayer.

00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:23.565
Given that all mankind was
sinful, believers were enjoined

00:09:23.565 --> 00:09:28.227
to repent of their sins,
to confess them,

00:09:28.227 --> 00:09:34.528
to perform penance for them and
in return they were granted

00:09:34.528 --> 00:09:37.570
absolution by the priest.
 

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:41.673
The church as a whole was
conceived of as a community of

00:09:41.673 --> 00:09:44.562
saints,
and so it was possible to pray

00:09:44.562 --> 00:09:48.807
for the souls of others,
in addition to which the saints

00:09:48.807 --> 00:09:53.581
already in heaven were believed
to intercede with God on behalf

00:09:53.581 --> 00:09:58.529
of living believers,
so petitionary prayers could be

00:09:58.529 --> 00:10:00.629
addressed to saints.
 

00:10:00.629 --> 00:10:05.791
And finally the expiation of
sins committed in life could

00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:11.597
continue after death when souls
lingered in purgatory until they

00:10:11.597 --> 00:10:15.928
were purged of sin and made fit
for heaven.

00:10:15.928 --> 00:10:20.929
The living could ease the
passage of the dead through

00:10:20.929 --> 00:10:23.720
purgatory by their prayers.
 

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.424
Only those who failed to
achieve salvation by their

00:10:27.424 --> 00:10:32.094
rejection of the means of grace
would probably ultimately suffer

00:10:32.094 --> 00:10:34.169
eternal torment in hell.
 

00:10:34.169 --> 00:10:35.350
Okay.
 

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:38.029
Those are the basic beliefs.
 

00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:42.011
In its transmission of these
central beliefs and in its

00:10:42.011 --> 00:10:46.067
practices of worship the
pre-reformation church fostered

00:10:46.067 --> 00:10:49.903
what's been described as a
ritually and visually rich

00:10:49.903 --> 00:10:51.009
religion.
 

00:10:51.009 --> 00:10:53.841
In a society in which the vast
majority of people were

00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:55.988
illiterate,
the decorations of the

00:10:55.988 --> 00:10:59.548
church--the paintings on the
wall like those in Easby,

00:10:59.548 --> 00:11:04.538
the images, the carved images
around the walls or the altars,

00:11:04.538 --> 00:11:07.158
the stained-glass windows with
their pictures--

00:11:07.158 --> 00:11:10.615
all of these were to a large
extent the books of the

00:11:10.615 --> 00:11:11.428
unlearned.
 

00:11:11.428 --> 00:11:16.578
And often they conveyed the
essence of central Bible

00:11:16.578 --> 00:11:19.451
stories,
like the progression from the

00:11:19.451 --> 00:11:22.851
Garden of Eden through to the
crucifixion and so forth at

00:11:22.851 --> 00:11:25.413
Easby,
and they conveyed sometimes the

00:11:25.413 --> 00:11:29.070
central doctrines of the faith
in visual representations.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.471
An outstanding example of this
is the fifteenth-century

00:11:32.471 --> 00:11:36.062
stained-glass window which
survives still in a church near

00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:38.519
Exeter in the West Country
called--

00:11:38.519 --> 00:11:40.840
at a place called
Doddingscombeleigh.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.389
They have interesting place
names in the West Country.

00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:47.764
I haven't written it on the
board because the word's too

00:11:47.764 --> 00:11:51.629
long, but you'll find it on your
handout, Doddingscombeleigh.

00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:57.139
In the great window there they
have portrayals of--in seven

00:11:57.139 --> 00:12:01.129
panels--of each of the seven
sacraments.

00:12:01.129 --> 00:12:05.120
Each of those panels is also
linked by a red line in the

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.460
glass to the wounds of Christ on
the cross,

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:12.379
and the message is quite clear:
Christ's sacrifice,

00:12:12.379 --> 00:12:16.418
the flow of grace along the red
lines through the sacraments,

00:12:16.418 --> 00:12:24.210
which the window represents the
congregation participating in.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:28.918
Or again most churches had an
elaborately carved 'rood screen'

00:12:28.918 --> 00:12:32.470
which stood at the entrance to
the chancel,

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.399
where the altar was,
with wooden statues above it--

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:42.720
again a crucifix and various
central saints all there for

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:48.250
observation and veneration by
the congregation.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:51.739
Well, numerous other images and
pictures would adorn the side

00:12:51.739 --> 00:12:55.876
chapels of the churches,
there would be altars dedicated

00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:58.860
to particular saints and so
forth,

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:03.318
and indeed this devotion to the
saints was a particularly marked

00:13:03.318 --> 00:13:06.928
characteristic of late medieval
popular religion.

00:13:06.928 --> 00:13:11.744
Images and shrines and relics
of the saints were much

00:13:11.744 --> 00:13:14.428
venerated and much visited.
 

00:13:14.428 --> 00:13:18.048
There were some very great
centers of pilgrimage.

00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:21.284
In Canterbury Cathedral was the
shrine of Saint Thomas �

00:13:21.284 --> 00:13:23.668
Becket, a twelfth-century
English saint.

00:13:23.668 --> 00:13:27.908
At Walsingham was a shrine
dedicated to the Virgin.

00:13:27.908 --> 00:13:30.538
At Durham was the shrine of
Saint Cuthbert,

00:13:30.538 --> 00:13:33.356
the great Saxon saint of the
north of England,

00:13:33.356 --> 00:13:34.860
and so one could go.
 

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.710
These were the great shrines.
 

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:40.860
But there were also many lesser
localized places which were

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.440
visited by pilgrims from the
area 'round about,

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.645
and they would make donations
to beautify the images at the

00:13:48.645 --> 00:13:52.490
altars of the saints and to
maintain their shrines.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.749
For example,
down near Exeter again there

00:13:55.749 --> 00:14:00.720
was a local saint called Saint
Sidwell, S-i-d-w-e-double l.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.610
She was a Celtic martyr from
the early days of the church in

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:06.440
Britain.
 

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:11.355
And records survive of the
gifts that people made to Saint

00:14:11.355 --> 00:14:13.080
Sidwell in Exeter.
 

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:18.418
One person gave her wedding
ring to Saint Sidwell.

00:14:18.418 --> 00:14:22.639
Girdles were given to adorn the
statue.

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:26.291
Rosary beads of fine quality
were given to be hung about the

00:14:26.291 --> 00:14:26.908
statute.
 

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:30.370
There was money given for
renewing the gilding on Saint

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.590
Sidwell's statue.
 

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:37.548
One person even gave money to
buy her a new pair of velvet

00:14:37.548 --> 00:14:38.700
slippers.
 

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:43.456
And in return people of course
made petitionary prayers to the

00:14:43.456 --> 00:14:44.080
saint.
 

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.287
You could borrow the girdles to
lay across a woman in

00:14:48.287 --> 00:14:52.090
childbirth, which was thought to
protect her.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:56.125
Well, obviously this was a
system which could offer a great

00:14:56.125 --> 00:14:59.255
deal of comfort,
but at the same time it could

00:14:59.255 --> 00:15:01.899
be open to the risk of
corruption.

00:15:01.899 --> 00:15:06.215
It could obscure people's focus
upon the central doctrines of

00:15:06.215 --> 00:15:10.097
the faith and substitute
devotion to particular saints'

00:15:10.097 --> 00:15:13.446
cults,
and at times expectations of an

00:15:13.446 --> 00:15:18.145
almost mechanical manipulation
of the powers of particular

00:15:18.145 --> 00:15:22.928
saints in response to acts of
veneration and donations.

00:15:22.928 --> 00:15:25.658
Erasmus of Rotterdam,
the great humanist scholar of

00:15:25.658 --> 00:15:28.826
the early sixteenth century who
taught at the University of

00:15:28.826 --> 00:15:32.970
Cambridge for a while,
was deeply critical of all this.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.250
He wanted a simpler,
more Bible-centered faith,

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:40.741
and he joked in one of his
essays about how there were

00:15:40.741 --> 00:15:45.551
enough pieces of the true cross,
or alleged pieces of the true

00:15:45.551 --> 00:15:47.779
cross,
in churches in Europe that if

00:15:47.779 --> 00:15:50.980
you got them all together you
could build Noah's ark.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:55.066
So Erasmus was prepared to
scoff at all of this,

00:15:55.066 --> 00:15:56.980
and he wasn't alone.
 

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:01.265
There was undoubtedly an
accretion of superstitious

00:16:01.265 --> 00:16:06.067
practices around these forms of
devotion which scrupulous

00:16:06.067 --> 00:16:10.440
churchmen like Erasmus found
very hard to take.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.349
And some of the saints who were
venerated were of rather dubious

00:16:13.349 --> 00:16:13.950
provenance.
 

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:18.876
All over the country there were
holy wells and holy trees where

00:16:18.876 --> 00:16:23.486
people would hang gifts and
offerings and make requests for

00:16:23.486 --> 00:16:24.678
assistance.
 

00:16:24.678 --> 00:16:29.282
Many of these were of very
dubious origins and probably had

00:16:29.282 --> 00:16:33.725
originated as Celtic water
spirits and tree spirits which

00:16:33.725 --> 00:16:38.248
had been gradually incorporated
into the local practice of

00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:41.740
Christianity in the early Middle
Ages.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.278
And then of course there was
the whole business of the

00:16:44.278 --> 00:16:44.710
relics.
 

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.017
The Abbey of Bury St.
 

00:16:46.017 --> 00:16:49.379
Edmunds, which lies about
halfway between Cambridge and

00:16:49.379 --> 00:16:51.558
Norwich, had quite a collection.
 

00:16:51.558 --> 00:16:55.918
They had the clippings from
Saint Edmund's nails.

00:16:55.918 --> 00:17:00.432
They had the coals with which
Saint Lawrence had been toasted

00:17:00.432 --> 00:17:01.259
to death.
 

00:17:01.259 --> 00:17:05.210
They had Sir Thomas--Saint
Thomas--of Canterbury's penknife

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.548
and one of his boots,
all of which were objects of

00:17:08.548 --> 00:17:09.568
veneration.
 

00:17:09.568 --> 00:17:14.132
Well, a lot of this was clearly
very far from being impeccably

00:17:14.132 --> 00:17:15.028
Christian.
 

00:17:15.028 --> 00:17:19.002
It was the product of the
medieval church's toleration of

00:17:19.002 --> 00:17:21.700
what people refer to as
syncretism,

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.608
the blending together of
different religious traditions,

00:17:25.608 --> 00:17:30.920
the Christianizing of some
older traditions like those holy

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.400
wells and sacred trees and so
forth.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.094
And at times it could
undoubtedly be hard to draw the

00:17:39.094 --> 00:17:44.509
line between where Christian
devotion to the saints ended and

00:17:44.509 --> 00:17:47.579
superstitious practices began.
 

00:17:47.579 --> 00:17:48.240
Okay.
 

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.082
Well, the old historiography
tended to lay a lot of emphasis

00:17:52.082 --> 00:17:56.403
on that kind of thing,
stressing the corruption and

00:17:56.403 --> 00:18:02.269
degeneracy of the old church and
the compromised nature of its

00:18:02.269 --> 00:18:03.808
spirituality.
 

00:18:03.808 --> 00:18:06.739
But more recently in the work
of historians like

00:18:06.739 --> 00:18:10.480
J.J. Scarisbrick and Eamon
Duffy and Christopher Haigh,

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.450
all of whom are on our reading
lists,

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:18.405
there's been a tendency to
point out instead the soundness

00:18:18.405 --> 00:18:23.275
of some of the core elements of
worship and to argue that

00:18:23.275 --> 00:18:28.057
whatever its faults the
pre-reformation religious system

00:18:28.057 --> 00:18:32.838
was in fact hugely successful
and hugely popular.

00:18:32.838 --> 00:18:37.852
Far from being a sort of rotten
tree ready to fall before the

00:18:37.852 --> 00:18:42.640
first blast of reforming wind,
Christopher Haigh argues that

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.298
late medieval Catholic
Christianity,

00:18:45.298 --> 00:18:48.941
to quote him,
"was not only secure in

00:18:48.941 --> 00:18:54.358
early Tudor England but also
luxuriant and energetic."

00:18:54.358 --> 00:18:58.343
And the strongest arguments in
favor of such views derives from

00:18:58.343 --> 00:19:02.005
the evidence of "energetic
commitment to conventional

00:19:02.005 --> 00:19:04.640
devotions"
at the lowest level,

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.210
at the level of the parish.
 

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:10.814
There are three major sources
of such evidence which people

00:19:10.814 --> 00:19:11.558
draw upon.
 

00:19:11.558 --> 00:19:14.940
First of all,
there are people's wills.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:20.474
Most of them from the early
sixteenth century leave some

00:19:20.474 --> 00:19:22.690
bequest to religion.
 

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:25.349
The request--the bequest--of
money for services,

00:19:25.349 --> 00:19:28.180
for the beautification of
churches and so forth.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.625
One of the most spectacular
examples is a man I've mentioned

00:19:31.625 --> 00:19:34.877
before,
the extremely wealthy Robert

00:19:34.877 --> 00:19:40.309
Jannys of the city of Norwich
who left when he died in the

00:19:40.309 --> 00:19:46.410
1520s the greater part of his
fortune for religious purposes.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.875
He left 1,400 pounds in all,
which I was trying to translate

00:19:49.875 --> 00:19:51.048
into modern money.
 

00:19:51.048 --> 00:19:55.615
It's difficult to do that but
five or six million dollars

00:19:55.615 --> 00:20:00.509
perhaps, left to religious
purposes, in modern equivalent.

00:20:00.509 --> 00:20:03.949
And there was a particular
focus in such pious bequests

00:20:03.949 --> 00:20:07.578
upon the endowing of prayers and
masses for dead souls.

00:20:07.578 --> 00:20:11.911
Robert Jannys for example of
his 1,400 pounds laid down that

00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:16.095
800 of it was to be spent on
paying priests to say prayers

00:20:16.095 --> 00:20:19.838
for his soul and for all other
Christian souls.

00:20:19.838 --> 00:20:24.750
And in addition he provided 400
pounds for masses which should

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:29.098
be said for the same--dedicated
to the same purpose.

00:20:29.098 --> 00:20:33.053
So pious bequests is one form
of evidence of this enthusiasm

00:20:33.053 --> 00:20:34.259
and involvement.
 

00:20:34.259 --> 00:20:36.608
Secondly, there are
churchwardens' accounts,

00:20:36.608 --> 00:20:39.390
the account books of parish
churches which sometimes

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:42.173
survive,
and they reveal the substantial

00:20:42.173 --> 00:20:45.763
sums of money which people
raised and spent on their

00:20:45.763 --> 00:20:48.241
churches,
on the fabric of the church and

00:20:48.241 --> 00:20:50.902
its rebuilding,
and beautification,

00:20:50.902 --> 00:20:53.180
and on its furnishings.
 

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:57.681
They spent far more on such
purposes than they ever paid in

00:20:57.681 --> 00:21:02.259
taxes or than they paid to their
manorial lords in rents.

00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:06.318
Thirdly, there's the evidence
of the activity of religious

00:21:06.318 --> 00:21:06.960
guilds.
 

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.741
All over the country there were
numerous fraternities or guilds

00:21:11.741 --> 00:21:16.446
formed for religious purposes
where people would band together

00:21:16.446 --> 00:21:21.307
to maintain an altar and to pray
for the souls of members of the

00:21:21.307 --> 00:21:24.714
guild,
both the living and those who

00:21:24.714 --> 00:21:25.960
had passed on.
 

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.342
They also often had charitable
functions, poor relief,

00:21:29.342 --> 00:21:31.130
and educational functions.
 

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.086
And there were very,
very many of these voluntary

00:21:34.086 --> 00:21:36.920
fraternities and guilds which
people joined.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.202
In the city of London alone
there were eighty-one religious

00:21:40.202 --> 00:21:43.430
fraternities operating in the
early years of the sixteenth

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:44.108
century.
 

00:21:44.108 --> 00:21:49.003
In Norwich in 1500 there were
twenty-one and even much smaller

00:21:49.003 --> 00:21:51.009
places could have them.
 

00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:52.900
The tiny parish of Morebath in
Devon,

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:57.010
which is to the north of
Exeter, was a place where they

00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:00.845
had several guilds which would--
which were run by different

00:22:00.845 --> 00:22:02.230
groups within the population.
 

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.848
There was a women's guild;
there was a young people's

00:22:04.848 --> 00:22:05.269
guild.
 

00:22:05.269 --> 00:22:09.134
The peasants of the area
dedicated some of their sheep to

00:22:09.134 --> 00:22:13.159
the maintenance of their guilds,
and the members took turns to

00:22:13.159 --> 00:22:16.599
look after those sheep and the
profits went for the maintenance

00:22:16.599 --> 00:22:18.210
of the guilds' activities.
 

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.980
Well, clearly there's a lot of
evidence of such activity,

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.471
and such investment in
traditional religion was clearly

00:22:26.471 --> 00:22:30.299
prodigious and participation was
widespread.

00:22:30.299 --> 00:22:34.690
You can't gainsay that;
the evidence is clear.

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:39.181
It supports such views as that
of the historian Richard Rex who

00:22:39.181 --> 00:22:43.527
argues that "it's possible
that the ideal of a Christian

00:22:43.527 --> 00:22:46.714
community united in belief and
worship,"

00:22:46.714 --> 00:22:50.118
an ideal which was to be
pursued so zealously by

00:22:50.118 --> 00:22:55.848
Protestants and Catholics alike,
"was never so closely

00:22:55.848 --> 00:23:00.518
approximated"
to as in the late medieval

00:23:00.518 --> 00:23:01.578
parish.
 

00:23:01.578 --> 00:23:04.828
It's certainly possible to read
the evidence that way.

00:23:04.828 --> 00:23:06.721
And at present,
as I've said,

00:23:06.721 --> 00:23:10.170
that's the dominant trend in
the historiography,

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:14.548
but at the same time one has to
recognize that it's not without

00:23:14.548 --> 00:23:15.890
some ambiguities.
 

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:20.681
One can't be sure quite how
well attended parish churches

00:23:20.681 --> 00:23:22.048
actually were.
 

00:23:22.048 --> 00:23:26.857
One can't be quite sure just
how extensive participation in

00:23:26.857 --> 00:23:31.000
parish guilds was--
in some places it seems to have

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.105
been quite widespread though
some guilds were somewhat

00:23:35.105 --> 00:23:36.808
socially exclusive.
 

00:23:36.808 --> 00:23:41.630
And above all it's been said
that a vast amount of the money

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:46.694
which was invested in the late
medieval church was invested for

00:23:46.694 --> 00:23:51.189
the specific purpose of easing
the passage of one's soul

00:23:51.189 --> 00:23:53.150
through purgatory.
 

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.646
That was fundamental to a great
deal of it, as in the case of

00:23:56.646 --> 00:23:57.578
Robert Jannys.
 

00:23:57.578 --> 00:24:03.291
And arguably that preoccupation
with easing the passage of souls

00:24:03.291 --> 00:24:08.732
through purgatory was motivated
more by fear than by anything

00:24:08.732 --> 00:24:09.548
else.
 

00:24:09.548 --> 00:24:14.503
In a sense, purgatory could
have been a somewhat oppressive

00:24:14.503 --> 00:24:17.771
doctrine,
raising anxiety particularly

00:24:17.771 --> 00:24:22.097
amongst those who couldn't
afford to pay for masses for

00:24:22.097 --> 00:24:23.298
their souls.
 

00:24:23.298 --> 00:24:26.522
In other words,
the fact of heavy investment in

00:24:26.522 --> 00:24:30.798
traditional religion cannot be
denied, but its meaning is open

00:24:30.798 --> 00:24:32.338
to interpretation.
 

00:24:32.338 --> 00:24:37.631
Like so much historical
evidence you can read it more

00:24:37.631 --> 00:24:39.259
ways than one.
 

00:24:39.259 --> 00:24:44.023
Well, you can say the same sort
of thing about the evidence

00:24:44.023 --> 00:24:48.461
relating to relationships
between members of the clergy

00:24:48.461 --> 00:24:49.940
and the laity.
 

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.365
Certainly, there was sometimes
quite acute conflict,

00:24:53.365 --> 00:24:56.118
especially over such matters as
tithes.

00:24:56.118 --> 00:24:59.496
People sometimes resented the
payment of tithes and resisted

00:24:59.496 --> 00:25:01.781
it,
or similarly other dues which

00:25:01.781 --> 00:25:06.096
might be demanded by the clergy,
mortuary payments when people

00:25:06.096 --> 00:25:07.430
died and so forth.
 

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:11.306
And then there was the
perennial problem of instances

00:25:11.306 --> 00:25:14.788
of clerical misbehavior,
especially the sexual

00:25:14.788 --> 00:25:18.535
misconduct of a clergy was--
which was--theoretically

00:25:18.535 --> 00:25:19.250
celibate.
 

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:23.556
That was the butt of a great
deal of ribald comment

00:25:23.556 --> 00:25:26.828
throughout the late medieval
period.

00:25:26.828 --> 00:25:30.440
Sometimes the jurisdiction of
the church courts,

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:34.674
which had jurisdiction over
such matters as marriage and the

00:25:34.674 --> 00:25:38.837
probate of wills and other
things which were of a spiritual

00:25:38.837 --> 00:25:41.515
nature,
this was sometimes resented

00:25:41.515 --> 00:25:45.897
particularly by their rivals,
the common lawyers in the

00:25:45.897 --> 00:25:47.368
secular courts.
 

00:25:47.368 --> 00:25:52.712
Or again the pomp and the pride
of some of the great clergy

00:25:52.712 --> 00:25:58.150
could occasion a certain amount
of cynicism and contempt.

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:01.830
An outstanding example of a
great clergyman who attracted

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:05.710
that kind of opprobrium was
Henry VIII's chief minister,

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:08.856
Thomas Wolsey,
Cardinal Wolsey,

00:26:08.856 --> 00:26:14.942
who to all intents and purposes
ran the government on Henry

00:26:14.942 --> 00:26:19.140
VIII's behalf between 1514 and
1529.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.430
Wolsey was proud;
he was arrogant;

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:26.059
he was extremely able but he
was arrogant;

00:26:26.059 --> 00:26:27.500
he held multiple livings.
 

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.700
He was Archbishop of York;
he was Bishop of Durham;

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.916
he held other church livings,
places he never visited,

00:26:32.916 --> 00:26:34.858
and drew the income from them.
 

00:26:34.858 --> 00:26:38.462
He engaged in a great deal of
conspicuous consumption,

00:26:38.462 --> 00:26:42.066
building his own palaces most
of which were eventually

00:26:42.066 --> 00:26:43.970
confiscated by the king.
 

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:48.308
He had a mistress and children
and so on and so forth.

00:26:48.308 --> 00:26:55.209
It's been argued that if few
people envisaged an alternative

00:26:55.209 --> 00:27:01.759
religion before 1520 there was
nonetheless a good deal of

00:27:01.759 --> 00:27:08.307
anticlericalism which could be
drawn upon when action was

00:27:08.307 --> 00:27:13.220
eventually taken against the
church.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:17.855
That view in--clearly has some
strength, and yet again one has

00:27:17.855 --> 00:27:21.200
to consider whether it might be
overdrawn.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.996
It's true that the parish
clergy were often not very well

00:27:24.996 --> 00:27:28.175
educated,
that some of them had moral

00:27:28.175 --> 00:27:31.277
failings,
that some of them came into

00:27:31.277 --> 00:27:33.970
conflict with their
parishioners.

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:36.917
But on the other hand the
crucial issue was whether they

00:27:36.917 --> 00:27:39.973
were adequate to perform the
religious services which were

00:27:39.973 --> 00:27:41.098
expected of them.
 

00:27:41.098 --> 00:27:45.108
Their principal duties were not
as educators;

00:27:45.108 --> 00:27:47.430
their principal duties were as
priests.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.118
Their principal duties were
sacerdotal.

00:27:49.118 --> 00:27:53.916
They had to perform the
rituals, the sacraments,

00:27:53.916 --> 00:27:55.038
the mass.
 

00:27:55.038 --> 00:27:59.554
If they had their faults,
they also had the sacred power

00:27:59.554 --> 00:28:04.480
by virtue of their ordination to
perform those sacraments.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.460
They had the power to
consecrate the elements in the

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:07.868
mass.
 

00:28:07.868 --> 00:28:11.309
They had the power to
administer the last rites to the

00:28:11.309 --> 00:28:11.828
dying.
 

00:28:11.828 --> 00:28:17.298
They had the power to absolve
sin and that above all set them

00:28:17.298 --> 00:28:22.766
apart, and it could make them
objects of reverence or even of

00:28:22.766 --> 00:28:23.858
anxiety.
 

00:28:23.858 --> 00:28:28.933
In a sense then human
weaknesses could be cloaked by

00:28:28.933 --> 00:28:31.720
the majesty of the office.
 

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.182
As for the higher clergy,
by the early sixteenth century

00:28:35.182 --> 00:28:38.142
men like Thomas Wolsey were
really spectacularly

00:28:38.142 --> 00:28:39.150
exceptional.
 

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:43.690
Most bishops on the whole were
quite an impressive group.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:46.784
If a lot of them were primarily
administrators in their

00:28:46.784 --> 00:28:49.596
functions,
and servants of the state very

00:28:49.596 --> 00:28:54.340
often as well as of the church,
they were often conscientious

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.240
enough in running their
dioceses.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:01.805
So given the powers and the
privileges of the clerical

00:29:01.805 --> 00:29:06.972
estate it was inevitable that
abuses could provoke resentment

00:29:06.972 --> 00:29:11.624
and indeed conflict and there
were occasional notorious

00:29:11.624 --> 00:29:15.759
scandals which appear
particularly significant in

00:29:15.759 --> 00:29:17.308
hindsight.
 

00:29:17.308 --> 00:29:21.069
Nevertheless,
if such incidents reveal

00:29:21.069 --> 00:29:27.269
tensions they don't necessarily
reveal a fundamental hostility

00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:30.318
to the established church.
 

00:29:30.318 --> 00:29:36.381
But there was real criticism
which went beyond mere

00:29:36.381 --> 00:29:43.048
occasional resentment and it
came from three sources.

00:29:43.048 --> 00:29:47.259
First of all,
there was criticism that came

00:29:47.259 --> 00:29:51.470
from reformers within the church
itself.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.700
John Colet, whose name is on
your handout,

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:59.200
the Dean of Saint Paul's
Cathedral in London,

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.221
was a man who was deeply
troubled by the failings of the

00:30:03.221 --> 00:30:03.880
church.
 

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.200
He--in a famous sermon which he
preached to Convocation,

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.088
which was the gathering of the
leading clergy,

00:30:09.088 --> 00:30:11.259
the parliament of the church if
you like--

00:30:11.259 --> 00:30:16.733
in a sermon to Convocation in
1511 he castigated the pride and

00:30:16.733 --> 00:30:21.940
the worldliness which was to be
found among some clergy.

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:25.891
And Colet could be said to be
representative of the long

00:30:25.891 --> 00:30:29.338
reformist tradition within the
church itself,

00:30:29.338 --> 00:30:33.585
whereby strict moralists
demanded from time to time that

00:30:33.585 --> 00:30:37.753
the clergy should live up to the
standards of their own

00:30:37.753 --> 00:30:42.077
profession in a manner which
would deserve the privileges

00:30:42.077 --> 00:30:43.930
that they enjoyed.
 

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:45.170
And Colet wasn't alone.
 

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:50.220
His close friend,
the pious layman Thomas More,

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:53.575
a learned and devout man,
sympathized greatly with

00:30:53.575 --> 00:30:57.752
Colet's desire for the reform of
clerical standards and so did

00:30:57.752 --> 00:31:00.150
others among the senior clergy.
 

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:03.088
Bishop John Fisher of
Rochester, which is down in

00:31:03.088 --> 00:31:04.826
Kent,
or Bishop Tunstall,

00:31:04.826 --> 00:31:07.292
first of London,
then of Durham,

00:31:07.292 --> 00:31:12.083
were other bishops who had
reforming agendas of this kind

00:31:12.083 --> 00:31:13.880
within the church.
 

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.880
Well, most of these were elite
critics.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.330
They, one could say,
enjoyed the luxury of knowing

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:24.625
better,
but they weren't willing to

00:31:24.625 --> 00:31:30.015
challenge the ultimate authority
of the church itself nor were

00:31:30.015 --> 00:31:35.050
they really willing to damage
the practice of piety of the

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:36.730
common people.
 

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:40.336
They were very anxious not to
break the unity of Christendom

00:31:40.336 --> 00:31:43.150
though they wanted the church to
reform itself,

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:45.288
and all of them died Catholics.
 

00:31:45.288 --> 00:31:49.319
Indeed, Thomas More and John
Fisher both died as martyrs for

00:31:49.319 --> 00:31:52.327
the old faith,
executed in the early years of

00:31:52.327 --> 00:31:54.650
the reformation by Henry VIII.
 

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:58.554
They died in defense of the
papal authority over the English

00:31:58.554 --> 00:31:59.150
church.
 

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:03.788
So there were some critics
within the church.

00:32:03.788 --> 00:32:07.673
At the other end of the scale
there were a set of very

00:32:07.673 --> 00:32:11.923
trenchant plebeian critics of
both church authority and the

00:32:11.923 --> 00:32:15.880
conventional nature of late
medieval Catholicism,

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:20.920
and these were the heretics
known in England as the

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.028
Lollards.
 

00:32:22.028 --> 00:32:26.786
Lollards were the followers of
a fourteenth-century Oxford

00:32:26.786 --> 00:32:31.375
theologian, John Wycliffe,
who had been very critical of

00:32:31.375 --> 00:32:33.630
the church of his time.
 

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:39.279
Wycliffe had died in 1384 but
his ideas survived him.

00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:44.468
The Lollards were an
underground heretical sect and

00:32:44.468 --> 00:32:50.279
they had survived for over a
century despite intermittent

00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:51.940
persecution.
 

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:56.539
They were deeply hostile to the
privileges enjoyed by the

00:32:56.539 --> 00:32:57.279
church.
 

00:32:57.279 --> 00:33:01.115
Many of them saw both the pope
and the church hierarchy as

00:33:01.115 --> 00:33:05.019
being a kind of collective
representation of Antichrist.

00:33:05.019 --> 00:33:08.622
They were deeply hostile to
veneration of the saints,

00:33:08.622 --> 00:33:12.778
the reverence shown to saints
and to relics of the saints.

00:33:12.778 --> 00:33:18.450
They regarded it as fraudulent
and idolatrous.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:22.355
They were skeptical of the
doctrine of transubstantiation

00:33:22.355 --> 00:33:25.238
in the mass which--
they tended to see the

00:33:25.238 --> 00:33:28.588
communion service more as a
service of remembrance.

00:33:28.588 --> 00:33:32.230
They regarded the doctrine of
purgatory as a false doctrine

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:35.368
which had been late introduced
into the church,

00:33:35.368 --> 00:33:39.413
and they saw the saying of
masses for souls as simply a

00:33:39.413 --> 00:33:43.306
mercenary racket to put money
into the pockets of the

00:33:43.306 --> 00:33:44.430
priesthood.
 

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:49.279
And above all they relied upon
the authority of the Bible.

00:33:49.279 --> 00:33:54.083
From the 1380s onwards,
Lollards had translated the New

00:33:54.083 --> 00:33:58.976
Testament into English and
copies of their New Testament

00:33:58.976 --> 00:34:03.512
translation were secretly
circulated amongst Lollard

00:34:03.512 --> 00:34:04.670
groups.
 

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.009
Some of them are extremely
beautiful.

00:34:06.009 --> 00:34:11.190
One tends to imagine these as
being rather primitive products

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:14.791
produced in secret,
but some of them survive and

00:34:14.791 --> 00:34:17.829
they could be in fact very
beautifully produced,

00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:21.320
even illuminated.
 

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:24.454
So these were the Lollards,
and all of these features of

00:34:24.454 --> 00:34:27.588
their beliefs and attitudes tend
to make them sound like

00:34:27.588 --> 00:34:31.940
proto-Protestants,
and so in a sense they were.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:35.521
Wycliffe undoubtedly influenced
the great Bohemian reformer of

00:34:35.521 --> 00:34:38.518
the fifteenth century,
Jan Hus of Prague,

00:34:38.518 --> 00:34:43.275
and Jan Hus' teachings deeply
influenced Martin Luther so

00:34:43.275 --> 00:34:47.099
there is a connection which can
be traced.

00:34:47.099 --> 00:34:51.581
Both Catholics and Protestants
were later to see the Lollards

00:34:51.581 --> 00:34:55.539
as being forerunners of the
reformation in England.

00:34:55.539 --> 00:35:02.210
That's a view you find already
current by the 1540s and 1550s.

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:08.434
But more recently their role
has been somewhat questioned,

00:35:08.434 --> 00:35:14.550
or at least their potential for
bringing about change.

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:18.936
The point usually made is that
certainly the Lollards were

00:35:18.936 --> 00:35:22.170
present but they were not very
numerous.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:23.920
Well, that's true.
 

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.014
Nevertheless,
there were some areas of

00:35:26.014 --> 00:35:26.920
concentration.
 

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:30.588
There were quite a few of them
in London, hiding out in the

00:35:30.588 --> 00:35:31.789
crowd as it were.
 

00:35:31.789 --> 00:35:34.644
There were some areas of the
country where their influence

00:35:34.644 --> 00:35:36.650
had spread and remained deeply
rooted.

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:41.992
The Chiltern Hills just to the
northwest of London was one area

00:35:41.992 --> 00:35:45.010
where they were well
established.

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:49.155
There were outposts of Lollardy
scattered through the small

00:35:49.155 --> 00:35:50.800
towns of East Anglia.
 

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.902
We know about all of this
because occasionally bishops

00:35:53.902 --> 00:35:57.710
would conduct a kind of purge of
Lollards within their diocese;

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:59.440
they would seek them out.
 

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:04.268
In 1521, one bishop conducted
such a purge in the county of

00:36:04.268 --> 00:36:07.177
Buckinghamshire,
which is over here,

00:36:07.177 --> 00:36:10.389
and he brought in over 400
Lollard suspects--

00:36:10.389 --> 00:36:14.068
so within a single county there
were a fair number of these

00:36:14.068 --> 00:36:14.639
people.
 

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:17.599
They were nevertheless
contained.

00:36:17.599 --> 00:36:19.940
The church courts were vigilant.
 

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.940
There were these occasional
purges.

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:24.827
Occasionally,
a Lollard was burned though

00:36:24.827 --> 00:36:29.016
most of them when they were
found tended to recant and then

00:36:29.016 --> 00:36:33.061
quietly go back when they
weren't being observed to their

00:36:33.061 --> 00:36:34.650
private beliefs.
 

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:38.606
Occasionally,
though, examples were made and

00:36:38.606 --> 00:36:40.539
people were burned.
 

00:36:40.539 --> 00:36:44.648
Over the nation as a whole they
were a tiny minority but they

00:36:44.648 --> 00:36:48.550
were there and in some areas
they were quite a significant

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:51.391
presence,
especially amongst the literate

00:36:51.391 --> 00:36:54.789
laity of London and parts of the
southeast of England,

00:36:54.789 --> 00:36:57.429
with scatterings of
sympathizers elsewhere.

00:36:57.429 --> 00:37:02.007
There were even some members of
the clergy who secretly

00:37:02.007 --> 00:37:04.719
sympathized with the Lollards.
 

00:37:04.719 --> 00:37:08.449
So they were able to retain a
presence,

00:37:08.449 --> 00:37:11.911
they were able to retain a
certain coherence through their

00:37:11.911 --> 00:37:15.556
underground contacts,
and I think it's a mistake to

00:37:15.556 --> 00:37:17.289
dismiss them entirely.
 

00:37:17.289 --> 00:37:21.253
One could compare them perhaps
to the dissidents of Eastern

00:37:21.253 --> 00:37:25.625
Europe in the 1970s and 1980s,
who were hard put to survive

00:37:25.625 --> 00:37:29.478
and were in no position to
overthrow the established

00:37:29.478 --> 00:37:32.403
system,
but were nonetheless a

00:37:32.403 --> 00:37:35.260
corrosive presence within it.
 

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:39.900
And when the structures of
power were eventually to be

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:45.155
shaken the Lollards similarly
were ready to come out into the

00:37:45.155 --> 00:37:49.710
open when they had the
opportunity and many did.

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:53.590
Well, between the critics
within the church,

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:56.010
the reforming members of the
higher clergy,

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:59.570
and the Lollards at the other
end of the scale,

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:06.295
there were small numbers of
people who can be legitimately

00:38:06.295 --> 00:38:10.190
described as early Protestants.
 

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:14.090
Most of them didn't actually
owe much to the Lollard

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:15.010
tradition.
 

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:16.909
They were mostly highly
educated;

00:38:16.909 --> 00:38:20.913
in fact, they were mostly
members of England's two

00:38:20.913 --> 00:38:23.690
universities,
Oxford and Cambridge,

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:26.469
but in particularly Cambridge.
 

00:38:26.469 --> 00:38:32.179
They were mostly men of
evangelical orientation,

00:38:32.179 --> 00:38:37.621
very pious, and when they
learned of Martin Luther's

00:38:37.621 --> 00:38:43.382
doctrinal protests made in
Germany in 1517 they took an

00:38:43.382 --> 00:38:44.768
interest.
 

00:38:44.768 --> 00:38:48.534
Luther's books were actually
available in the early years

00:38:48.534 --> 00:38:50.820
after his first protest of 1517.
 

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:54.250
They weren't actually banned
until the early 1520s,

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:58.769
so people could get hold of
copies from Germany and they

00:38:58.769 --> 00:39:02.880
were able to read them to see
what was going on.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:07.260
Some of them became persuaded
of Luther's arguments.

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.820
The Cambridge men,
who included Thomas Cranmer,

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:14.692
later to be the Archbishop of
Canterbury under the reformed

00:39:14.692 --> 00:39:17.750
church,
met secretly at a tavern known

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:22.768
as the White Horse Tavern which
was in the red light district of

00:39:22.768 --> 00:39:25.949
the town near the river--
it still stands;

00:39:25.949 --> 00:39:28.469
it's now the Cambridgeshire
Folk Museum--

00:39:28.469 --> 00:39:32.909
and the meetings amongst them
were known as Little Germany

00:39:32.909 --> 00:39:37.349
because they were discussing
books which had been smuggled

00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:41.789
from the centers of the early
reformation in Germany.

00:39:41.789 --> 00:39:45.047
They also discussed the works
of the early Swiss reformers

00:39:45.047 --> 00:39:46.820
which were available to them.
 

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:50.621
Well, the position of these
early Protestants was often

00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:51.960
rather ambiguous.
 

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:56.829
Not all of them had made a full
transition to doctrinal heresy.

00:39:56.829 --> 00:40:01.875
One who was much venerated
later was a man named Thomas

00:40:01.875 --> 00:40:07.108
Bilney, who was actually
captured and burned at the stake

00:40:07.108 --> 00:40:08.230
in 1531.
 

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:12.829
It seems unlikely that Bilney
was ever a full-blown Lutheran.

00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:17.175
Nonetheless,
he was a passionate evangelical

00:40:17.175 --> 00:40:23.949
who detested some aspects of the
practice of worship at the time.

00:40:23.949 --> 00:40:26.599
He saw it as a cluttered form
of devotion.

00:40:26.599 --> 00:40:31.400
He wanted a much more
biblically based religion and he

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.300
preached openly these beliefs.
 

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.777
In his own words,
he "went up to

00:40:37.777 --> 00:40:41.641
Jerusalem"
for those beliefs and was

00:40:41.641 --> 00:40:45.989
eventually burned in the city of
Norwich.

00:40:45.989 --> 00:40:48.110
Bilney was a sort--of
Protestant one could say;

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:50.010
he was halfway there.
 

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:52.670
Or another example is William
Tyndale.

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:55.847
Tyndale was the first
translator, other than the

00:40:55.847 --> 00:40:58.597
Lollards,
of the New Testament into

00:40:58.597 --> 00:41:03.251
English, the translator of the
first published version of the

00:41:03.251 --> 00:41:05.190
English New Testament.
 

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:09.282
He had long had the idea that
it was desirable to translate

00:41:09.282 --> 00:41:13.402
the scriptures into English,
but he originally brought that

00:41:13.402 --> 00:41:18.650
project to Cuthbert Tunstall,
the reforming Bishop of London.

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:23.362
He was willing to do it within
the boundaries of the existing

00:41:23.362 --> 00:41:24.070
church.
 

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:27.210
Tunstall, however,
would not back him.

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:31.318
Tunstall, like many churchmen,
associated the scriptures in

00:41:31.318 --> 00:41:33.019
English with Lollardy.
 

00:41:33.019 --> 00:41:35.079
He thought it was too dangerous.
 

00:41:35.079 --> 00:41:38.831
So Tyndale had to look for
support elsewhere and when

00:41:38.831 --> 00:41:42.871
rejected he found patronage from
a London merchant called

00:41:42.871 --> 00:41:44.460
Humphrey Monmouth.
 

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:49.659
Humphrey Monmouth is known to
have been a Lollard sympathizer.

00:41:49.659 --> 00:41:54.110
He sent Tyndale abroad where
Tyndale eventually became a

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:59.130
Lutheran and in 1526 produced
his New Testament in Germany,

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:03.731
had it printed there,
and copies were subsequently

00:42:03.731 --> 00:42:08.706
smuggled into England through
the cloth trade with the

00:42:08.706 --> 00:42:10.210
Netherlands.
 

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:11.952
The fact that these early
Protestants were mostly based in

00:42:11.952 --> 00:42:13.481
Cambridge and parts of East
Anglia and London is no

00:42:13.481 --> 00:42:13.880
accident.
 

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:18.932
These are the areas most easily
reached by the trade routes from

00:42:18.932 --> 00:42:21.340
the Netherlands and Germany.
 

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:24.670
Well, as William Tyndale's
story indicates,

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:29.025
people like him had a rather
separate origin from the

00:42:29.025 --> 00:42:32.090
Lollards,
but not infrequently they

00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:34.730
eventually linked up with them.
 

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:38.844
The older Lollard networks were
sometimes activated to smuggle

00:42:38.844 --> 00:42:43.094
New Testaments into England and
Lutheran books into England once

00:42:43.094 --> 00:42:46.570
they were banned,
and by the 1520s the two

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:50.219
movements had to a large extent
overlapped.

00:42:50.219 --> 00:42:54.503
To some extent they were
merging together and becoming

00:42:54.503 --> 00:42:56.929
one, a critical underground.
 

00:42:56.929 --> 00:43:03.693
So one can say that England had
a religious underground by the

00:43:03.693 --> 00:43:04.579
1520s.
 

00:43:04.579 --> 00:43:09.096
It did not in itself mount a
significant challenge to the

00:43:09.096 --> 00:43:11.920
hegemony of traditional
religion.

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.960
In all probability,
it would never have

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:19.282
spontaneously gained the
strength to mount a victorious

00:43:19.282 --> 00:43:23.844
challenge to the religious
status quo of the kind that was

00:43:23.844 --> 00:43:28.487
mounted by Protestants in some
of the cities of Germany and

00:43:28.487 --> 00:43:32.170
Switzerland and Flanders and so
forth.

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:34.697
But to say that,
that they might never have

00:43:34.697 --> 00:43:38.369
gained the spontaneous strength
to mount such a challenge,

00:43:38.369 --> 00:43:44.702
is speculation because of
course what actually happened is

00:43:44.702 --> 00:43:50.590
that this tiny minority of
dissidents actually won.

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:55.340
And what made it possible was a
contingent circumstance,

00:43:55.340 --> 00:44:00.648
a contingent circumstance of
the kind that so often makes

00:44:00.648 --> 00:44:06.619
history take turns which are
otherwise utterly unpredictable.

00:44:06.619 --> 00:44:09.139
And that circumstance is
probably known to you.

00:44:09.139 --> 00:44:14.097
In 1527, King Henry VIII,
a man whose hostility to Martin

00:44:14.097 --> 00:44:19.585
Luther and the early Protestants
was such that he had written a

00:44:19.585 --> 00:44:24.806
book against them and had been
awarded the title Defender of

00:44:24.806 --> 00:44:31.507
the Faith from the pope in 1521,
this man decided that he needed

00:44:31.507 --> 00:44:34.860
to have his marriage dissolved.
 

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:37.010
He was thirty-five.
 

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:40.219
His wife, Katherine,
was forty-ish.

00:44:40.219 --> 00:44:45.713
They had one daughter but they
had no son and the Tudor

00:44:45.713 --> 00:44:48.460
succession was in danger.
 

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:50.980
Henry needed his marriage
dissolved;

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:53.659
he needed it desperately.
 

00:44:53.659 --> 00:44:57.909
All the achievements of his
father and his own early reign

00:44:57.909 --> 00:45:01.936
in establishing the Tudor
dynasty were at risk of being

00:45:01.936 --> 00:45:05.070
lost without a male heir to the
crown.

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:06.599
He needed a new wife.
 

00:45:06.599 --> 00:45:11.934
He needed to remarry,
hopefully to beget such a son

00:45:11.934 --> 00:45:13.750
to succeed him.
 

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:19.559
The pope, Clement VII,
would have loved to cooperate.

00:45:19.559 --> 00:45:22.909
Popes usually cooperated with
kings over such difficult

00:45:22.909 --> 00:45:23.530
matters.
 

00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:27.635
But he couldn't oblige for
political reasons since the pope

00:45:27.635 --> 00:45:31.599
was in the immediate power of
the Emperor of Germany,

00:45:31.599 --> 00:45:37.559
Charles V, who happened to be
Queen Katherine's nephew.

00:45:37.559 --> 00:45:42.717
So these were the contingent
circumstances and it was those

00:45:42.717 --> 00:45:48.500
contingent circumstances which
were to make all the difference.

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:51.199
And how that happened we'll
look at next week.

00:45:51.199 --> 00:45:56.000

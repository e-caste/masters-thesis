00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.867
Professor Robert
Shiller: I believe that we

00:00:05.867 --> 00:00:09.460
still have on,
for Friday, Stephen Schwarzman.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.827
He said he would do it.
I always worry about people who

00:00:13.827 --> 00:00:18.901
have such important businesses
because some big deal may become

00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:23.036
in crisis or something;
people like that have trouble

00:00:23.036 --> 00:00:25.390
sometimes adhering to a
schedule.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.440
As far as I know we're getting
him, so I hope that you will all

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.920
be able to come this Friday,
here, at the usual time.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.190
If there's any problem with his
appearing I will email you.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.365
As you know,
Stephen Schwarzman is a

00:00:43.365 --> 00:00:48.808
graduate of Yale College and
he's one of the great stories of

00:00:48.808 --> 00:00:53.201
our century.
He created just about the

00:00:53.201 --> 00:01:00.731
biggest private equity firm from
scratch in 1985 and I guess they

00:01:00.731 --> 00:01:06.849
just went public and they have a
huge market cap.

00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:10.464
They're comparable to one of
the biggest old line investment

00:01:10.464 --> 00:01:13.476
banks in New York.
He just--he and Peter

00:01:13.476 --> 00:01:17.813
Peterson--just created it so I
think it will be very

00:01:17.813 --> 00:01:22.791
interesting to hear him.
Again, you'll have a chance to

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:25.920
question him about what he's
done.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.906
I put on the reading list
The New Yorker article

00:01:30.906 --> 00:01:34.182
that's out right now.
Well actually,

00:01:34.182 --> 00:01:39.122
I guess it came out a couple of
weeks ago, but it's up on our

00:01:39.122 --> 00:01:42.408
syllabus.
I think I might want to take it

00:01:42.408 --> 00:01:46.552
down before he comes.
I'm going to turn--I'm going to

00:01:46.552 --> 00:01:51.739
reflect on this because he may
not be pleased with the article.

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:57.530
It's a very hard-hitting
critical article.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.702
He had to be a tough
businessman to arrive where he

00:02:01.702 --> 00:02:04.610
is.
The New Yorker article

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.506
talks about the price of his
condo--or co-op--in New York,

00:02:09.506 --> 00:02:13.801
which set some record,
and so they tell things like

00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:17.048
that.
I was just yesterday in London

00:02:17.048 --> 00:02:21.030
and people like to gossip about
things like that.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.565
The limo driver was driving me
to the airport and was pointing

00:02:24.565 --> 00:02:27.470
out the scenes in London.
He said, you know that building?

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.950
Some Arab Sheikh just paid one
hundred million pounds for that

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.064
apartment--that penthouse
apartment--in that building and

00:02:36.064 --> 00:02:40.545
the same Sheikh is ordering a
Airbus for his--one of these big

00:02:40.545 --> 00:02:44.585
Airbus airplanes--for his
personal plane and he's having

00:02:44.585 --> 00:02:48.630
it plated with gold leaf.
Did you hear this story?

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.818
Does anyone--is this true?
This limo driver told me this

00:02:51.818 --> 00:02:54.565
yesterday;
he said it's going to cost him

00:02:54.565 --> 00:02:59.030
five hundred million pounds or
something like that to do this.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.251
These are gossip.
The real substance is what the

00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:07.599
man does--or woman does--for the
world.

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.020
So, I gleaned here a list of
some of the charities

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.719
that--Stephen Schwarzman is a
major philanthropist.

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:20.107
He set up something called The
Blackstone Foundation from the

00:03:20.107 --> 00:03:25.405
Blackstone Group and he's a
major donor or collaborator with

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:29.125
the Frick Collection,
The Whitney Museum,

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.301
Phoenix House,
The Red Cross,

00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:34.020
The Inner City Scholarship
Fund,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.349
New York City Outward Bound,
and the Asia Society.

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.721
I think that's the real thing
we should talk about,

00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:46.658
not the size of his penthouse.
So, I might try to find a more

00:03:46.658 --> 00:03:50.849
even-handed account and put that
up on the website.

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.314
Incidentally,
there's sort of a resemblance

00:03:55.314 --> 00:04:00.629
between him and David Swensen in
the–well,

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.737
first of all,
they're both phenomenally

00:04:02.737 --> 00:04:05.622
successful, but they both are
emphasizing alternative

00:04:05.622 --> 00:04:09.623
investments.
They're not straight-laced

00:04:09.623 --> 00:04:12.806
old-fashioned;
they're willing to take

00:04:12.806 --> 00:04:17.168
experiments.
I think he should be very

00:04:17.168 --> 00:04:22.170
interesting;
that's Friday at 9.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.362
I want to talk about the stock
market today and I thought I

00:04:28.362 --> 00:04:34.553
would keep it more or less basic
because I think--I want to

00:04:34.553 --> 00:04:39.446
emphasize basic concepts.
A lot I'm going to talk about

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:43.410
is Modigliani-Miller but I'm not
going to get too deep into it,

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.129
maybe in your review sections
you can get more technical.

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.941
I'm going to just talk about it
in the very intuitive,

00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:58.290
direct terms.
What are stocks?

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.383
I think the idea of a stock
must have been invented

00:05:01.383 --> 00:05:03.920
independently at many times in
history.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.420
The word "shares" is the
fundamental word.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.322
Suppose you are starting a
business with somebody--it could

00:05:14.322 --> 00:05:17.533
be at any time in
history--Babylonia or

00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:20.829
something--this must have
happened.

00:05:20.829 --> 00:05:25.672
A group of people starts a
business and they say,

00:05:25.672 --> 00:05:30.240
let's divide up the proceeds.
That's very direct, isn't it?

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.779
If we're all working together
we divide up the proceeds.

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:36.639
That means we're allocating
shares.

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.435
Now, I don't know how far back
it goes but it must be that in

00:05:40.435 --> 00:05:42.839
ancient times some people would
say,

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:45.547
all right you're going to be
doing more work or you're

00:05:45.547 --> 00:05:47.540
contributing more to this
enterprise,

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.879
we'll give you a bigger share
of the profits.

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:54.417
That's so basic,
it must have happened a million

00:05:54.417 --> 00:05:59.629
times and that's the basic idea
of the stock market.

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:05.547
All it is is that we've got it
much more high-flown and much

00:06:05.547 --> 00:06:11.465
more legalized than--the basic
idea is that you have to have

00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:16.881
shares in something--a
business--and the idea goes back

00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:22.342
clearly to ancient Rome.
Let's consider a business as

00:06:22.342 --> 00:06:26.107
sort of a person who is owned,
like a slave,

00:06:26.107 --> 00:06:30.656
who is owned by other people.
In law, the word "person"

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:33.310
doesn't mean what you think it
means.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.341
There's--in law,
a "natural person" is you and

00:06:38.341 --> 00:06:40.925
me;
people, real flesh and blood

00:06:40.925 --> 00:06:43.819
individuals are called natural
persons.

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:48.024
But when we say "person," it
also--that's more general--it

00:06:48.024 --> 00:06:52.046
also includes corporation.
The word "corporation" comes

00:06:52.046 --> 00:06:54.562
from the Latin,
corpus, meaning body,

00:06:54.562 --> 00:06:58.570
so it's an embodiment.
We create an entity that,

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.819
in the eyes of the law,
is like an individual.

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:06.499
It may be owned by other
individuals but it has its own

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:10.110
rights and responsibilities as
if it were a person.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.463
In ancient Rome,
corporations were called

00:07:13.463 --> 00:07:18.825
publicani--that's Latin;
the publicani were

00:07:18.825 --> 00:07:24.284
companies like we have today.
According to the research of

00:07:24.284 --> 00:07:28.888
Ulrike Malmendier at Stanford,
she thinks that the stock

00:07:28.888 --> 00:07:33.744
market in ancient Rome was done
on the street--on the Roman

00:07:33.744 --> 00:07:37.009
Forum--and she can tell you
where.

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:39.718
When you go to Rome,
you can walk and see what's

00:07:39.718 --> 00:07:43.912
left of their stock market.
It never flourished really

00:07:43.912 --> 00:07:48.848
until relatively modern times.
The idea, of course,

00:07:48.848 --> 00:07:53.671
is that we have a legal
entity--a corporation--that

00:07:53.671 --> 00:07:59.457
issues shares that are either
given to people or purchased by

00:07:59.457 --> 00:08:05.629
people and the idea is that
shares represent contributions.

00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:09.413
You give shares to someone who
is contributing to the

00:08:09.413 --> 00:08:12.530
enterprise.
You can--when you set up a

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:17.371
corporation there are different
kinds of relationships that

00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:20.709
people might have with a
corporation.

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:24.129
One of them is as a shareholder
and the shareholder gets a

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:27.009
share--is entitled to a
share--of the profits.

00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:31.217
There are also employees who
get wages and that's very

00:08:31.217 --> 00:08:34.840
different.
They have a labor contract that

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.769
specifies how much they will
get.

00:08:37.769 --> 00:08:42.940
Then you have debtors and other
people with other relationships.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.605
The fundamental one is the
shareholder because the

00:08:45.605 --> 00:08:47.510
shareholder owns the
corporation.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:01.751
As it's evolved in modern
times, the corporation has a

00:09:01.751 --> 00:09:05.761
charter or bylaws.
When you create a corporation

00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:08.939
you write up a contract,
which specifies the rules of

00:09:08.939 --> 00:09:11.425
the corporation;
it's like a constitution for

00:09:11.425 --> 00:09:14.611
the corporation.
Also, the law of the state in

00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:19.211
which the corporation is
chartered also puts restrictions

00:09:19.211 --> 00:09:23.876
on what can be in the bylaws.
Notably, it's typically

00:09:23.876 --> 00:09:29.187
required that it's one share,
one vote and that there's a--it

00:09:29.187 --> 00:09:34.233
would be also required that
there be an annual meeting--at

00:09:34.233 --> 00:09:38.669
least once a year,
a shareholder meeting--and then

00:09:38.669 --> 00:09:42.230
the shareholders can vote on
relevant issues.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.700
One of the most important
issues then is to elect a board

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.767
of directors.
The state law probably requires

00:09:48.767 --> 00:09:51.940
that a corporation have a board
of directors,

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.248
but it's also something that
can be defined at the time that

00:09:55.248 --> 00:09:57.659
you create the corporation in
the bylaws.

00:09:57.659 --> 00:10:02.830
It's not something you can do
just whatever you want.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:09.605
State law has requirements for
the board of directors and--I'm

00:10:09.605 --> 00:10:14.159
just going to talk in very basic
terms.

00:10:14.159 --> 00:10:17.769
The usual structure is one
shareholder, one vote.

00:10:17.769 --> 00:10:22.521
At the annual meeting,
the shareholders can come and

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:28.389
elect a board and the board then
is in charge of the company.

00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:33.075
The board hires the president
or chief executive officer and

00:10:33.075 --> 00:10:37.045
other top officers of the
company and they serve as

00:10:37.045 --> 00:10:41.235
employees of the board.
The theory is that the

00:10:41.235 --> 00:10:46.721
shareholders are in control
because they elect the board and

00:10:46.721 --> 00:10:51.650
the board hires the president
and it's democratic.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.892
I'm going to come back to it;
it doesn't always work out as

00:10:54.892 --> 00:10:57.505
perfectly as you want.
Now there's

00:10:57.505 --> 00:11:02.432
basically–there are
important distinctions between

00:11:02.432 --> 00:11:07.113
two kinds of corporations.
There's for-profit and

00:11:07.113 --> 00:11:09.685
non-profit.
I've been describing a

00:11:09.685 --> 00:11:13.080
for-profit corporation,
which is the usual variety.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:18.363
Non-profit corporations will
also have a board of directors

00:11:18.363 --> 00:11:22.190
but they will not have any
shareholders.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.501
There's a fundamental
difference in the charter and

00:11:24.501 --> 00:11:26.350
the way the government reacts to
them.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:32.437
The non-profit organization or
corporation is set up to advance

00:11:32.437 --> 00:11:36.659
some cause and it is not owned
by anyone.

00:11:36.659 --> 00:11:39.284
The share price,
you could say,

00:11:39.284 --> 00:11:42.863
is identically zero.
Actually, you can't say what

00:11:42.863 --> 00:11:46.583
the share price is because there
are zero shares and they have a

00:11:46.583 --> 00:11:49.875
zero price,
so the value of the price per

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:54.039
share is zero over zero and you
can't define it.

00:11:54.039 --> 00:11:57.090
Yale University is a non-profit
corporation;

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.972
the price of a share in Yale
University is undefined--it's

00:12:00.972 --> 00:12:04.617
zero over zero.
It has a board that runs it,

00:12:04.617 --> 00:12:08.970
but the board is not liable to
shareholder vote.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.660
Well actually,
we have some voting among

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.445
alumni I guess,
but it's not a for-profit

00:12:16.445 --> 00:12:20.350
corporation.
I'm going to be talking about

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:24.210
for-profit.
Now, the critical thing to

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:30.504
understand about a corporation
is that in order to value a

00:12:30.504 --> 00:12:36.355
share in a corporation you
absolutely have to know the

00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:42.683
number of shares outstanding.
If I own one thousand shares in

00:12:42.683 --> 00:12:47.567
a company, what does that mean?
It doesn't mean anything until

00:12:47.567 --> 00:12:52.023
you know how many shares are
outstanding because if I own one

00:12:52.023 --> 00:12:56.479
thousand shares and then you
look it up and find out how many

00:12:56.479 --> 00:13:01.010
shares are outstanding--there
are one thousand--you say,

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:04.166
hey I own the whole company.
It's mine if I own one thousand

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:06.360
shares and there are one
thousand outstanding.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.846
What if you own one thousand
shares and there are ten million

00:13:09.846 --> 00:13:13.825
outstanding?
Well, then that means that you

00:13:13.825 --> 00:13:17.940
own one ten-thousandth of the
company.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.511
Did I divide right?
That's a very important lesson

00:13:22.511 --> 00:13:26.183
to keep in mind.
People don't usually know how

00:13:26.183 --> 00:13:30.009
many shares are outstanding in
the company that they invest in.

00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:33.141
That's because,
in a sense, they're trusting to

00:13:33.141 --> 00:13:35.299
analysts.
Ultimately, analysts are

00:13:35.299 --> 00:13:38.688
supposed to keep track of this.
When they look at the price of

00:13:38.688 --> 00:13:41.251
a company, how do we know
whether the price at which

00:13:41.251 --> 00:13:44.435
you're buying is reasonable?
They must be looking at some

00:13:44.435 --> 00:13:47.570
measure of the value of the
company and dividing by the

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:51.169
number of shares and then that
gives them some idea of what the

00:13:51.169 --> 00:13:54.017
share is worth.
But it's absolutely

00:13:54.017 --> 00:13:59.347
essential--so the shares only
mean something as a relation to

00:13:59.347 --> 00:14:04.127
their total number of shares.
Companies routinely do what are

00:14:04.127 --> 00:14:08.830
called "splits."
They may do a two-for-one split;

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:13.776
that means, if you held one
thousand shares you get a letter

00:14:13.776 --> 00:14:18.639
saying, congratulations you now
own two thousand shares.

00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:22.986
Don't be too jubilant because
when they do a split they do it

00:14:22.986 --> 00:14:27.389
to every single shareholder.
So, you now have two thousand

00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:32.078
shares, but now there are twenty
million shares outstanding in

00:14:32.078 --> 00:14:35.230
the company so the ratio is
unchanged.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.129
You might ask,
well why do they do splits?

00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:40.687
Well, it's just to keep the
numbers--there's actually not a

00:14:40.687 --> 00:14:44.341
very good reason to do splits.
There's no reason not to do

00:14:44.341 --> 00:14:47.600
splits either because it's just
changing the units of

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.694
measurement.
But typically,

00:14:49.694 --> 00:14:53.568
in the United States,
they do splits to keep the

00:14:53.568 --> 00:14:58.019
price of a share somewhere in
the $20 to $40 range;

00:14:58.019 --> 00:15:01.610
there's interesting literature
on why they do that.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.436
Maybe it's a tradition,
maybe it's to keep the value

00:15:05.436 --> 00:15:10.087
kind of in a familiar range or a
small--they don't want them to

00:15:10.087 --> 00:15:14.589
get too expensive because people
can't--small investors can't

00:15:14.589 --> 00:15:18.029
afford them anymore.
Who knows, but the point is

00:15:18.029 --> 00:15:20.179
it's different in different
countries.

00:15:20.179 --> 00:15:26.620
So the total number of shares
is almost--the tendency to do

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:31.789
splits is a cultural thing;
it's of no real significance.

00:15:31.789 --> 00:15:34.597
Warren Buffett doesn't do
splits with his Berkshire

00:15:34.597 --> 00:15:37.854
Hathaway and there are other
companies that--I guess Google

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:40.100
doesn't do splits,
isn't that right?

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.200
Is that right or are you saying
no?

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.950
Actually, I don't remember,
but they haven't done one yet.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.830
What is the price per share,
do you know?

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:58.371
This is getting a little
high--$550 a share is kind of

00:15:58.371 --> 00:16:06.913
high because most people will
buy--this is part of our

00:16:06.913 --> 00:16:10.631
tradition.
Most people will buy shares in

00:16:10.631 --> 00:16:13.309
what's called "round blocks,"
that's a hundred shares.

00:16:13.309 --> 00:16:20.809
So, if it's $550,
that makes $55,000 for a one

00:16:20.809 --> 00:16:25.183
round lot.
I can't multiply while I'm

00:16:25.183 --> 00:16:26.370
standing up.

00:16:33.429 --> 00:16:35.532
Most companies do splits
because that might close

00:16:35.532 --> 00:16:37.766
the--you might have been
thinking about investing in

00:16:37.766 --> 00:16:40.000
Google but you could still--you
could just say,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.984
I want to buy ten shares or
five shares and the broker will

00:16:42.984 --> 00:16:45.248
do it for you,
but they might charge a higher

00:16:45.248 --> 00:16:52.070
commission.
That's the lesson.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:57.114
There's a term--I should write
some of my terms down--a very

00:16:57.114 --> 00:17:01.389
important term in finance and
that's "dilution."

00:17:01.389 --> 00:17:06.887
If the company increases the
number of shares through a split

00:17:06.887 --> 00:17:12.660
that is not dilution because it
doesn't really mean anything.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.827
When you do a split,
you're changing the number of

00:17:15.827 --> 00:17:19.188
shares for everybody,
so it can have no effect on the

00:17:19.188 --> 00:17:22.309
ratio for anybody;
it's just purely appearance.

00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:26.383
Dilution occurs when the
company changes the number of

00:17:26.383 --> 00:17:30.609
shares asymmetrically--not
changing it for everybody.

00:17:30.609 --> 00:17:36.231
The typical example of dilution
is: the board of directors has

00:17:36.231 --> 00:17:42.130
hired a CEO for the company and
they want to motivate the CEO.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:48.029
They can pay the CEO a salary
or they can give shares to the

00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:53.329
CEO--that's quite standard
because they feel that that

00:17:53.329 --> 00:17:58.475
makes the CEO a shareholder.
It's like another form of

00:17:58.475 --> 00:18:01.900
compensation and that
compensation might have

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.945
different attractiveness,
so they give the person a

00:18:05.945 --> 00:18:08.930
package--both a salary and some
shares.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.287
You see, if they give the--if
they merely give shares to the

00:18:13.287 --> 00:18:16.019
CEO without increasing your
shares,

00:18:16.019 --> 00:18:19.712
then you are being diluted
because it's raising the total

00:18:19.712 --> 00:18:21.690
and it's reducing the ratio.

00:18:26.509 --> 00:18:30.551
Now, if a company sells shares,
it issues new shares--it can do

00:18:30.551 --> 00:18:33.883
that at any time.
When you start a company you

00:18:33.883 --> 00:18:38.592
might have had--maybe when Peter
Peterson and Stephen Schwarzman

00:18:38.592 --> 00:18:42.703
founded The Blackstone Group
they gave each of them five

00:18:42.703 --> 00:18:47.263
hundred shares--I'm just making
that up--but obviously there's

00:18:47.263 --> 00:18:51.299
going to be more shareholders as
time comes in.

00:18:51.299 --> 00:18:54.890
One thing that people can do to
get in is to buy shares.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:19:01.352
If the company issues new
shares by selling them to the

00:19:01.352 --> 00:19:05.900
public, it's not obviously
dilution.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:10.232
Of course it's lowering your
share of the company,

00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:15.714
but offsetting this is that the
company is taking in money from

00:19:15.714 --> 00:19:21.549
the person who bought the shares
and so it doesn't dilute you.

00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:25.599
Well, you could say it dilutes
it but it doesn't lower the

00:19:25.599 --> 00:19:28.369
price of your investment,
in general.

00:19:28.369 --> 00:19:30.970
It could, depending on a lot of
factors.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:37.732
Dilution occurs--the term
specifically refers to changes

00:19:37.732 --> 00:19:43.143
in a number of shares that
affect, adversely,

00:19:43.143 --> 00:19:51.034
existing shareholders.
Another common term is a "stock

00:19:51.034 --> 00:19:53.372
dividend."
Well first of all,

00:19:53.372 --> 00:19:54.530
I should talk about dividends.

00:19:59.089 --> 00:20:04.061
The stock market--I was going
to talk about stock dividends,

00:20:04.061 --> 00:20:07.599
but I better talk about
dividends first.

00:20:07.599 --> 00:20:12.756
In for-profit companies,
people are investing in the

00:20:12.756 --> 00:20:18.369
company for profit.
How do they get the profit?

00:20:18.369 --> 00:20:23.301
Well, the company--the board of
directors--decides if and when

00:20:23.301 --> 00:20:27.747
to pay dividends to the
shareholders and then the law of

00:20:27.747 --> 00:20:32.759
the state would say that they
must treat them all equally.

00:20:32.759 --> 00:20:35.635
They made some money and now
they want to take it out and

00:20:35.635 --> 00:20:37.933
spend it.
They have to do it equally to

00:20:37.933 --> 00:20:41.410
all shareholders;
that's called paying a dividend.

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:45.613
They can do it on rare
occasions, or they can do it

00:20:45.613 --> 00:20:50.490
whenever they feel like it,
or they can do it regularly;

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:54.649
it's often done quarterly.
When I set up a company--Case

00:20:54.649 --> 00:20:58.356
Shiller Weiss,
Inc.--typical of young start up

00:20:58.356 --> 00:21:01.569
companies, we didn't pay a
dividend.

00:21:01.569 --> 00:21:06.475
We gave shares to almost all of
our employees as part of their

00:21:06.475 --> 00:21:11.140
compensation and we hoped that
would motivate them and make

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:15.563
them feel a part of the company
but we never paid them a

00:21:15.563 --> 00:21:18.095
dividend.
I remember one time I was

00:21:18.095 --> 00:21:21.381
talking to our CEO and he said,
you know maybe we should pay at

00:21:21.381 --> 00:21:24.508
least one dividend because our
employees are forgetting that

00:21:24.508 --> 00:21:28.656
they own these shares.
So, we paid one dividend and I

00:21:28.656 --> 00:21:32.551
don't know how much excitement
it generated,

00:21:32.551 --> 00:21:36.717
but that's the--
Student: Does this mean

00:21:36.717 --> 00:21:41.970
that share price will drop by $2
after a $2 dividend?

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.053
Immediately after the payout
dividend, the share--the price

00:21:45.053 --> 00:21:47.019
of the share should go down,
right?

00:21:47.019 --> 00:21:49.314
Professor Robert
Shiller: Yes,

00:21:49.314 --> 00:21:52.948
he's asking after a firm pays a
dividend that should lower

00:21:52.948 --> 00:21:56.645
the--you were asking whether it
should lower the price of a

00:21:56.645 --> 00:21:59.059
share.
Yes, you are absolutely right.

00:21:59.059 --> 00:22:04.181
If the company pays out money,
the value of the company should

00:22:04.181 --> 00:22:08.380
have just gone down by the
amount they paid out,

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.119
but the number of shares hasn't
changed.

00:22:11.119 --> 00:22:15.132
That means that the price of
each share should decline by the

00:22:15.132 --> 00:22:18.809
amount they paid out divided by
the number of shares.

00:22:18.809 --> 00:22:22.960
There's a term for that--they
call it going ex-dividend.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:29.381
So the company--it used to be
you could look on--you can still

00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:32.487
see this.
Some of these are still listed

00:22:32.487 --> 00:22:34.890
on The New York Stock Exchange
page;

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:37.891
on the day that a stock goes
ex-dividend, they'll have a

00:22:37.891 --> 00:22:41.383
little "x" by its price.
The reason they put that there

00:22:41.383 --> 00:22:43.940
is so that people don't get
alarmed.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:47.963
A lot of people watch the price
of their share everyday--some

00:22:47.963 --> 00:22:51.651
people get neurotic about
it--and then suddenly it drops

00:22:51.651 --> 00:22:55.210
by $2 a share and they say,
oh my God I'm worried.

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.549
They call up their broker and
say, what's wrong?

00:22:57.549 --> 00:23:01.268
Then the broker has to explain,
no didn't you see the "x"

00:23:01.268 --> 00:23:03.119
there?
It just went ex-dividend,

00:23:03.119 --> 00:23:06.107
so it doesn't mean anything.
The "ex-dividend date" is not

00:23:06.107 --> 00:23:08.619
the date that you actually
received the dividend,

00:23:08.619 --> 00:23:14.290
but it's called the ex-dividend
date, which the company decides

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:19.687
on that date anyone who was a
stockholder of record gets the

00:23:19.687 --> 00:23:25.440
dividend and the guy after that,
you don't get that dividend.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.039
That's an important--this
really does happen,

00:23:30.039 --> 00:23:35.579
stocks really do drop in price
on ex-dividend date.

00:23:35.579 --> 00:23:38.619
Now incidentally,
that's an interesting question

00:23:38.619 --> 00:23:41.400
that you bring up,
because--should I pay any

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.440
attention to dividend dates as
an investor?

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:49.972
The answer is generally not
because if you buy the stock

00:23:49.972 --> 00:23:55.048
before it goes ex-dividend,
you get--you have to pay a

00:23:55.048 --> 00:23:58.369
higher price,
but you get the dividend.

00:23:58.369 --> 00:24:01.998
If you wait until the next day,
you pay a lower price but you

00:24:01.998 --> 00:24:05.341
don't get the dividend.
Unless there are some tax

00:24:05.341 --> 00:24:09.369
effects, which might matter--and
taxes always complicate

00:24:09.369 --> 00:24:12.300
things--but disregarding tax
effects,

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:19.131
it doesn't matter which you do.
In fact, there's a rule,

00:24:19.131 --> 00:24:22.022
FINRA, which licenses
stockbrokers,

00:24:22.022 --> 00:24:26.359
tells their people,
you must not sell dividends;

00:24:26.359 --> 00:24:30.421
they're referring to a bad
practice that some unscrupulous

00:24:30.421 --> 00:24:33.793
stockbrokers occasionally do.
They'll tell someone,

00:24:33.793 --> 00:24:36.618
hurry up and buy this stock
because it's going to go

00:24:36.618 --> 00:24:40.163
ex-dividend.
If you buy it today--if you

00:24:40.163 --> 00:24:43.579
wait, you won't get the
dividend.

00:24:43.579 --> 00:24:46.274
That's misleading because it
really doesn't matter when you

00:24:46.274 --> 00:24:48.133
buy the stock,
so you're not supposed to,

00:24:48.133 --> 00:24:49.619
as a broker,
sell dividends.

00:24:49.619 --> 00:24:52.720
That doesn't mean dividends
don't matter.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:58.329
Ultimately, they're a reason
why you own a stock.

00:24:58.329 --> 00:25:03.813
This gets back--People are
accustomed to getting dividend

00:25:03.813 --> 00:25:07.553
checks in the mail.
If you own stock--we don't get

00:25:07.553 --> 00:25:10.640
them in the mail anymore because
you own it through some

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.390
brokerage account and you get it
on a website.

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.410
You used to get checks in the
mail;

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:18.810
now you go on a website and
you'll see that your dividends

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:22.640
are credited to your account,
but money is growing in your

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.470
account as companies pay out
dividends.

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:30.493
I was going to talk about a
stock dividend and I started to

00:25:30.493 --> 00:25:33.635
do that.
Sometimes companies will

00:25:33.635 --> 00:25:38.281
announce that they are paying
not a cash dividend,

00:25:38.281 --> 00:25:41.980
but they're paying a stock
dividend.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.497
They'll say,
we are pleased to announce that

00:25:45.497 --> 00:25:50.160
we are paying a dividend in new
shares issued today by the

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:54.742
company equal to 5% of your
existing shares--so it's a 5%

00:25:54.742 --> 00:26:00.410
dividend--congratulations.
Is that a good thing?

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:03.380
How excited should you be to
get the letter saying your

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.580
company has paid you a stock
dividend?

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:10.329
Any ideas on that?
Well, you should be absolutely

00:26:10.329 --> 00:26:14.509
unexcited because it doesn't
mean anything;

00:26:14.509 --> 00:26:18.535
if they were giving you extra
shares and just you alone,

00:26:18.535 --> 00:26:21.609
that would be great--that would
be good.

00:26:21.609 --> 00:26:26.346
The whole essence of a stock
dividend is that they're paying

00:26:26.346 --> 00:26:30.279
it to every shareholder in the
same proportion,

00:26:30.279 --> 00:26:33.571
so every one hundred shares
becomes one hundred and five

00:26:33.571 --> 00:26:36.317
shares;
so you know that that has no

00:26:36.317 --> 00:26:39.702
meaning to me.
All that matters is the ratio:

00:26:39.702 --> 00:26:43.518
how many shares I own divided
by the number of shares

00:26:43.518 --> 00:26:46.340
outstanding.
If they both go up by the same

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.724
proportion, then numerator and
denominator go up by the same

00:26:49.724 --> 00:26:52.925
amount, so there's no change.
Then you might ask,

00:26:52.925 --> 00:26:57.092
why in the world do companies
issue stock dividends anyway,

00:26:57.092 --> 00:27:00.922
what's the point?
Are they trying to confuse or

00:27:00.922 --> 00:27:04.438
fool somebody?
Well, there are different views

00:27:04.438 --> 00:27:06.070
on that.
One of them is yes,

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:08.420
they are trying to confuse and
fool somebody.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:12.048
If they don't have money to pay
the dividend they can always do

00:27:12.048 --> 00:27:14.080
a stock dividend.
On the other hand,

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.279
some people say,
well that would backfire.

00:27:16.279 --> 00:27:19.361
If they're going to pay stock
dividends and try to fool us,

00:27:19.361 --> 00:27:21.989
what's going to happen?
The price of a share is going

00:27:21.989 --> 00:27:24.142
to fall on that day.
When you pay out stock

00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:27.339
dividends you would think that
now there are more shares,

00:27:27.339 --> 00:27:30.026
everyone divides by the larger
number of shares,

00:27:30.026 --> 00:27:32.369
and the value of the company
goes down;

00:27:32.369 --> 00:27:34.289
it's not going to work to pay a
stock dividend.

00:27:34.289 --> 00:27:37.659
So, the more enlightened view
is, corporations only pay a

00:27:37.659 --> 00:27:41.210
stock dividend when they have
some good news to announce.

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:44.087
Typically, they'll write a
letter saying,

00:27:44.087 --> 00:27:46.750
congratulations we have great
news!

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:50.410
We have some new breakthrough
and in celebration of this we're

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.049
going to pay everyone a 5% stock
dividend.

00:27:53.049 --> 00:27:57.450
Now, they are hoping that the
price doesn't fall because

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:00.490
they're announcing it with news
and,

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:02.866
in a sense, issuing the stock
dividend is just a way to make

00:28:02.866 --> 00:28:03.430
it dramatic.

00:28:11.009 --> 00:28:12.853
Now incidentally,
in a for-profit

00:28:12.853 --> 00:28:15.331
corporation--this is how to
understand this,

00:28:15.331 --> 00:28:18.039
this is a concept that is
enshrined in law.

00:28:18.039 --> 00:28:22.768
In a for-profit corporation,
the purpose of the entity is

00:28:22.768 --> 00:28:26.230
defined as profit for the
shareholders.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:30.500
Now, in some countries and in
some jurisdictions the law might

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:34.321
not be entirely clear on that;
they might say there are other

00:28:34.321 --> 00:28:36.885
stakeholders.
But, in the purest form--and

00:28:36.885 --> 00:28:40.928
this is the form that we have in
the United States--the company

00:28:40.928 --> 00:28:44.790
exists for the shareholders.
They're the ones--there are

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:48.063
other people who have contracts
with the company,

00:28:48.063 --> 00:28:51.062
like the employees,
but the employees are not

00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:54.491
shareholders;
they are receiving salary or

00:28:54.491 --> 00:28:57.397
something else.
The important thing for the

00:28:57.397 --> 00:29:00.509
corporation is to live up to any
promises it made.

00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:02.430
It has to live up to its
promises.

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:06.519
The purpose of the corporation
is the shareholders.

00:29:06.519 --> 00:29:11.609
This is a capitalist idea that
might sometimes sound wrong.

00:29:11.609 --> 00:29:13.858
You might say,
why should a company exist for

00:29:13.858 --> 00:29:17.074
the shareholders?
Well, the concept here is that

00:29:17.074 --> 00:29:20.719
it's a good business model.
People do need money and they

00:29:20.719 --> 00:29:24.003
go into business to make money;
so let's make it clear,

00:29:24.003 --> 00:29:26.740
that's what the company is
going to do.

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:30.089
It has to behave in an
honorable way for everyone;

00:29:30.089 --> 00:29:31.579
it has to live up to its
contract.

00:29:31.579 --> 00:29:34.230
But the company generally
doesn't give to charity;

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:38.200
it doesn't contribute to
political campaigns;

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.416
it shouldn't be,
ideally, doing any of those

00:29:40.416 --> 00:29:42.682
things.
It should be trying to get

00:29:42.682 --> 00:29:46.417
money back to the shareholders.
If you ever serve on a board of

00:29:46.417 --> 00:29:49.109
directors--this is the thing
that I want you to remember

00:29:49.109 --> 00:29:51.900
because many of you will serve
on boards of directors.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:58.041
When you sign on to a job on
the board, you are signing on to

00:29:58.041 --> 00:30:04.388
a solemn responsibility and that
responsibility is to treat all

00:30:04.388 --> 00:30:10.529
shareholders equally and fairly
and make money for them.

00:30:10.529 --> 00:30:14.588
Then you're not supposed to
ever do anything that's not

00:30:14.588 --> 00:30:17.519
honest or not living up to
contracts,

00:30:17.519 --> 00:30:21.819
but your purpose is only one
purpose: it's the shareholder.

00:30:21.819 --> 00:30:27.160
When you serve on a board,
you are in a fiduciary role;

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.081
you are there to protect
shareholders and that's the

00:30:31.081 --> 00:30:33.922
concept.
It's for-profit and the theory

00:30:33.922 --> 00:30:37.928
that we have in capitalist
countries is that this is a good

00:30:37.928 --> 00:30:40.045
model.
There are non-profits,

00:30:40.045 --> 00:30:43.988
fine, but we--a lot of the
stuff that has to be done for an

00:30:43.988 --> 00:30:47.456
economy is only going to get
done through for-profit

00:30:47.456 --> 00:30:50.895
corporations.
So let's make it clear--let's

00:30:50.895 --> 00:30:55.708
make it unambiguous--people who
are on boards or are managers of

00:30:55.708 --> 00:30:59.163
these companies,
they can give their personal

00:30:59.163 --> 00:31:03.385
money to charities but they
themselves are obligated to make

00:31:03.385 --> 00:31:06.059
money.
It's not a vice.

00:31:06.059 --> 00:31:09.845
This is the concept that is in
the law and the reason we have

00:31:09.845 --> 00:31:13.504
it in the law is that it works
to produce prosperity and to

00:31:13.504 --> 00:31:16.422
produce the things we need,
like clothes,

00:31:16.422 --> 00:31:18.940
medical service,
homes, whatever.

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:22.740
So that's why we do it and
there's no shame in pursuing

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.259
profits and getting it out to
your shareholders.

00:31:26.259 --> 00:31:30.515
Now ultimately,
the purpose of investing in a

00:31:30.515 --> 00:31:36.082
share is to get the dividends;
that's the whole named purpose

00:31:36.082 --> 00:31:41.018
of the corporation.
I might add though that there

00:31:41.018 --> 00:31:47.369
are other ways that--I may have
said that too narrowly.

00:31:47.369 --> 00:31:50.110
Traditionally,
you buy stocks to get

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:52.440
dividends;
that's the reason.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:57.430
I want to be careful about
qualifying that.

00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:00.660
First of all,
a lot of people don't seem to

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:04.813
even grasp that basic point that
you buy stocks for the

00:32:04.813 --> 00:32:07.993
dividends.
A lot of people think,

00:32:07.993 --> 00:32:11.319
I will buy stocks.
But why do people buy stocks?

00:32:11.319 --> 00:32:14.267
They'll buy stocks because they
think price is going to go up

00:32:14.267 --> 00:32:16.956
and make them a lot of money.
They can sell it at an

00:32:16.956 --> 00:32:19.810
advantage.
That's what most people think,

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.079
right?
Do I buy stocks for dividends?

00:32:22.079 --> 00:32:24.714
Some people don't even know
what a dividend is,

00:32:24.714 --> 00:32:28.150
they just think of stock as
something whose price goes up.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:31.638
It doesn't make sense to think
that the price of anything would

00:32:31.638 --> 00:32:33.720
go up if that's all there is to
it.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.447
Why would people pay any price
for stocks if there weren't some

00:32:37.447 --> 00:32:40.851
way to get money out?
The ultimate thing is the

00:32:40.851 --> 00:32:42.624
dividend;
the dividends,

00:32:42.624 --> 00:32:46.549
even though a lot of people
forget the dividends and don't

00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:50.682
realize how important they are,
they are actually the driving

00:32:50.682 --> 00:32:53.671
force.
I wanted to just show you a

00:32:53.671 --> 00:32:58.133
plot that you already saw in
your--if you looked on the

00:32:58.133 --> 00:33:04.134
spreadsheet that I had up.
This is the stock market for

00:33:04.134 --> 00:33:07.753
the United States;
it's the Standard &amp;

00:33:07.753 --> 00:33:10.931
Poor Composite.
In 1957, they reformulated it

00:33:10.931 --> 00:33:14.839
and they called it the Standard
&amp; Poor 500,

00:33:14.839 --> 00:33:20.776
but I'm using their long
theories, back to 1871,

00:33:20.776 --> 00:33:25.890
so I can't call it the 500;
I'm calling it the Composite.

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:34.382
What this is is the price of a
portfolio of shares in U.S.

00:33:34.382 --> 00:33:38.895
companies.
It's kind of like the average

00:33:38.895 --> 00:33:44.346
price of a share adjusted for
splits because you don't want

00:33:44.346 --> 00:33:49.140
the--obviously when they do a
two-for-one split,

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.238
the price falls in half and
that's meaningless,

00:33:51.238 --> 00:33:52.880
so you want to correct for
splits.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:57.680
S&amp;P corrects for splits and
follows the price of a share.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:01.141
Now unfortunately,
the same companies are not

00:34:01.141 --> 00:34:05.860
around--the companies that we
had in 1871, hardly any of them

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:09.710
even exist anymore.
What they do is they're pricing

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:13.659
a portfolio up here and they
keep substituting in new ones.

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:16.804
There's an index committee that
keeps bringing in new shares

00:34:16.804 --> 00:34:18.829
when new companies become
important;

00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:22.579
they try to get the 500
representative of the most

00:34:22.579 --> 00:34:25.409
companies in the world--in the
U.S.

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:29.639
You can see that's what the
price has done.

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:34.310
There are also the earnings per
share.

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:37.785
What are earnings per share?
Earnings are something that

00:34:37.785 --> 00:34:42.081
accountants have generated and
they've been doing it all the

00:34:42.081 --> 00:34:45.429
way back to 1871--it's a
venerable concept;

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:48.994
it's how much money the company
made this year,

00:34:48.994 --> 00:34:53.925
if it's annual earnings.
The price of a share is the

00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:59.001
price of the ownership of that
earnings' stream,

00:34:59.001 --> 00:35:02.163
forever.
If I buy a share I'm in with

00:35:02.163 --> 00:35:06.038
everyone else who owns the
company and I have a claim on

00:35:06.038 --> 00:35:10.050
the earnings' stream,
but the earnings' stream is a

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:13.346
year-by-year thing.
It just tells you how well they

00:35:13.346 --> 00:35:16.952
did in that given year.
You can see that the stock

00:35:16.952 --> 00:35:22.244
market has been more volatile
than the earnings and the price

00:35:22.244 --> 00:35:27.800
of a share is many times higher
than the earnings per share.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:31.962
So, typically the ratio of
price-to-earnings has been about

00:35:31.962 --> 00:35:34.469
fifteen.
That means that people will pay

00:35:34.469 --> 00:35:37.010
up front for about fifteen
years' earnings.

00:35:44.489 --> 00:35:48.940
Earnings and dividends are
different;

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:53.050
earnings is the money that the
company made in a given year.

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:58.064
How do they know what they made?
That's a complicated thing that

00:35:58.064 --> 00:36:02.134
accountants figure out and
accountants find it difficult to

00:36:02.134 --> 00:36:04.659
define the earnings of a
company,

00:36:04.659 --> 00:36:07.610
but they do something and they
come up with a number.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:10.557
It may surprise the company
directors how much we made or

00:36:10.557 --> 00:36:13.190
how little we made according to
the accountants.

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:17.760
The dividend is something much
more concrete.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.503
This is what they actually send
out--this is cash sent out to

00:36:21.503 --> 00:36:23.959
shareholders.
"Earnings" is kind of a

00:36:23.959 --> 00:36:27.527
theoretical concept that
accountants work on and it can

00:36:27.527 --> 00:36:31.030
go up and down depending on
adjustments they make.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:35.236
They might decide that we have
some investment over there that

00:36:35.236 --> 00:36:39.029
we just lost money on and we
should take a write off for

00:36:39.029 --> 00:36:41.153
that.
The management might say,

00:36:41.153 --> 00:36:44.639
well what do you mean we didn't
lose any money this year?

00:36:44.639 --> 00:36:46.250
But the accountants thought we
did.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:50.585
So that's earnings.
Dividends is very concrete,

00:36:50.585 --> 00:36:55.225
it's what they send out.
Here is the price-earnings

00:36:55.225 --> 00:37:00.044
ratio for the U.S.
stock market from 1881 to the

00:37:00.044 --> 00:37:05.776
present--this is also on that
spreadsheet that you have on the

00:37:05.776 --> 00:37:09.348
website.
You can see that I'm saying

00:37:09.348 --> 00:37:13.862
about fifteen--fifteen times
earnings is typical,

00:37:13.862 --> 00:37:18.940
but we're in a high
price-to-earnings scenario now.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:22.649
It goes up and down depending
on the outlook for earnings and

00:37:22.649 --> 00:37:25.568
maybe other factors.
The red line is long-term

00:37:25.568 --> 00:37:28.187
interest rates,
but I won't talk more about

00:37:28.187 --> 00:37:30.848
that right now.
The earnings is a measure of

00:37:30.848 --> 00:37:34.146
the value of the company and
typically they've been valued at

00:37:34.146 --> 00:37:36.400
something like fifteen times
earnings.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.947
When the price-earnings ratio
gets high like it did in 1929

00:37:39.947 --> 00:37:41.856
people get antsy.
They thought,

00:37:41.856 --> 00:37:44.840
oh my God, the price earnings
ratio is thirty-five.

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.907
Again, this is price divided by
ten-year earnings,

00:37:47.907 --> 00:37:50.530
not one-year earnings.
This is what I do.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:53.347
We had an extraordinarily high
price-to-earnings ratio

00:37:53.347 --> 00:37:56.644
representing a lot of optimism
in the '20s for the stock market

00:37:56.644 --> 00:37:59.887
and then it corrected and went
abruptly downward--that was The

00:37:59.887 --> 00:38:02.271
Great Depression.
We had a similar,

00:38:02.271 --> 00:38:06.370
even higher price-to-earnings
ratio of about forty-six at the

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:09.239
peak in 2000 and it corrected
way down.

00:38:09.239 --> 00:38:13.104
The price reflects--really,
when you buy a share of a

00:38:13.104 --> 00:38:16.993
company you own it forever.
You will be--you are entitled

00:38:16.993 --> 00:38:20.758
to receiving the dividends that
are paid out of earnings for the

00:38:20.758 --> 00:38:24.164
rest of your life and you can
give it to your children and

00:38:24.164 --> 00:38:27.870
maybe in two hundred years from
now it'll be worth a lot;

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:31.598
probably not, but it might be.
It probably won't even in exist

00:38:31.598 --> 00:38:35.038
in fifty years but it will be
bought by some other company and

00:38:35.038 --> 00:38:38.140
it will still have value and
will still be going up.

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:44.227
That's the price-earnings ratio.
The earnings,

00:38:44.227 --> 00:38:47.573
you understand,
are kind of a theoretical

00:38:47.573 --> 00:38:52.090
concept but dividend is the
money that we send out.

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:55.010
How does the company decide on
dividends?

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:59.167
That's again up to the board to
decide or they can set up a

00:38:59.167 --> 00:39:02.250
committee on the board that
would decide,

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:05.833
but ultimately,
that's a major decision to send

00:39:05.833 --> 00:39:09.722
out dividends.
Typically, young companies do

00:39:09.722 --> 00:39:13.382
not send out dividends.
If you set up a company,

00:39:13.382 --> 00:39:16.755
you don't want to pay a
dividend for a while because you

00:39:16.755 --> 00:39:20.067
need the money and you're
reinvesting it in the company

00:39:20.067 --> 00:39:23.412
and people will understand.
They don't expect to get their

00:39:23.412 --> 00:39:25.210
money out of an investment right
away.

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:29.409
As a company matures,
then they typically feel that

00:39:29.409 --> 00:39:33.812
it's time to pay a dividend.
The S&amp;P 500 is 500

00:39:33.812 --> 00:39:38.434
companies, who are major
companies, so these tend to be

00:39:38.434 --> 00:39:43.398
mature companies and they tend
to be in the dividend-paying

00:39:43.398 --> 00:39:50.276
stage.
The question then is--the

00:39:50.276 --> 00:40:03.099
payout ratio is dividends over
earnings, I say Div/E.

00:40:03.099 --> 00:40:05.650
I have the payout ratio for the
United States;

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:11.550
that's the payout ratio going
back to 1871.

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:16.916
There are some spikes up like,
for example,

00:40:16.916 --> 00:40:23.050
in--what year--that was 1921
maybe--this year,

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:28.781
this is 1932 or 1933--the
companies were paying out 160%

00:40:28.781 --> 00:40:33.244
of their earnings as dividends.
You might say,

00:40:33.244 --> 00:40:37.039
well what's going on here?
It was The Depression.

00:40:37.039 --> 00:40:42.137
What was actually happening
was, The Depression was killing

00:40:42.137 --> 00:40:45.504
these companies;
they weren't making any money,

00:40:45.504 --> 00:40:48.775
but they didn't want to cut
their dividends because they

00:40:48.775 --> 00:40:52.760
were afraid that if they cut the
dividend people would be upset.

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.459
They're trying--maybe they did
cut it but they didn't cut it

00:40:55.459 --> 00:40:58.113
too much, so that means that
they were paying out more than

00:40:58.113 --> 00:41:00.406
they were earning.
That's what typically happens

00:41:00.406 --> 00:41:02.199
in these spikes;
it was a crisis.

00:41:02.199 --> 00:41:05.940
Now, there's also a trend
downward.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:09.766
They used to pay out typically
like 80% of their earnings but

00:41:09.766 --> 00:41:13.210
it's been gradually going
downward and now it's down to

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:15.921
like 40%.
That's a cultural thing,

00:41:15.921 --> 00:41:18.625
I would say;
it's that companies now are

00:41:18.625 --> 00:41:22.884
wanting to keep the money.
It may have to do with the fact

00:41:22.884 --> 00:41:27.949
that people today don't seem to
be as focused on dividends and

00:41:27.949 --> 00:41:33.098
so that means that companies are
more able to reinvest earnings

00:41:33.098 --> 00:41:37.019
and not pay.
This is the dividend-price

00:41:37.019 --> 00:41:41.608
ratio back to 1871.
Back in the late nineteenth

00:41:41.608 --> 00:41:46.630
century the dividend price ratio
was typically 5%.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:50.139
I think it was clearer in those
days.

00:41:50.139 --> 00:41:53.080
In terms of just general
investing culture--and we're

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.416
behavioral in our attitude--it
was clearer that you bought a

00:41:56.416 --> 00:41:59.555
stock to get a dividend.
Stocks were kind of different

00:41:59.555 --> 00:42:01.790
in those days.
They were more like railroads

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:04.110
or steel companies and it was
just understood.

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:07.658
If someone were recommending
you a stock, you'd first say,

00:42:07.658 --> 00:42:10.234
what is its dividend?
And if someone said,

00:42:10.234 --> 00:42:12.865
it's 4%, you'd say,
well that's kind of meager,

00:42:12.865 --> 00:42:15.039
I want a better dividend than
that.

00:42:15.039 --> 00:42:19.719
Now, people don't seem to be
focused on them.

00:42:19.719 --> 00:42:25.692
In another sense,
they're more willing to entrust

00:42:25.692 --> 00:42:33.281
the money back to the board of
directors to decide on when and

00:42:33.281 --> 00:42:38.563
whether to pay dividends.
Now the other thing is,

00:42:38.563 --> 00:42:42.711
there are other ways to get
money out of a company without

00:42:42.711 --> 00:42:46.860
paying a dividend and one of
them is stock repurchase.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.647
There's also liquidation.
Let me mention liquidation or

00:42:56.647 --> 00:42:57.730
sale of company.

00:43:02.559 --> 00:43:06.598
I'll talk about this--the
company doesn't ever have to pay

00:43:06.598 --> 00:43:09.033
a dividend.
All it can do is keep piling in

00:43:09.033 --> 00:43:11.866
the money and accumulating it
and then someone will buy the

00:43:11.866 --> 00:43:14.796
whole company and then all of
the shareholders will be bought

00:43:14.796 --> 00:43:18.687
out at a termination date.
That's one way that a--but

00:43:18.687 --> 00:43:24.357
often, when companies are bought
out, they don't give them cash

00:43:24.357 --> 00:43:28.929
they give them shares in the
acquiring company.

00:43:28.929 --> 00:43:32.291
So, then you would be relying
on getting dividends from the

00:43:32.291 --> 00:43:35.858
acquiring company.
I don't emphasize this cash

00:43:35.858 --> 00:43:40.230
sale of a company,
but it does happen sometimes.

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:46.292
The other thing that a company
can do to get money out is share

00:43:46.292 --> 00:43:51.670
repurchase--a stock repurchase
or a share repurchase.

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:56.025
It's perfectly--this sometimes
surprises people when they first

00:43:56.025 --> 00:43:58.702
think about it.
You, as an individual,

00:43:58.702 --> 00:44:02.206
can call up your broker and
say, I want to buy Google

00:44:02.206 --> 00:44:05.573
shares.
But Larry Paige at Google can

00:44:05.573 --> 00:44:11.425
call up a broker--he better get
the board's permission--somebody

00:44:11.425 --> 00:44:16.812
at Google can call up a broker
and make the same statement:

00:44:16.812 --> 00:44:21.111
we want to buy Google shares.
You might say,

00:44:21.111 --> 00:44:25.940
well how can Google buy Google?
"Why not?"

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.561
is the answer.
Why shouldn't Google buy Google

00:44:28.561 --> 00:44:30.669
shares?
Then you might--well let me ask

00:44:30.669 --> 00:44:34.012
you this, what would happen if
Google decided to buy up all of

00:44:34.012 --> 00:44:37.130
its shares?
Could that happen?

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:47.919
I'm the CEO of Google and I
call the broker and I say,

00:44:47.919 --> 00:44:51.389
how many shares are
outstanding?

00:44:51.389 --> 00:44:53.213
Like 100,000,000 or
some–no,

00:44:53.213 --> 00:44:56.196
it wouldn't be 100,000,000--we
know the price is $500 a

00:44:56.196 --> 00:44:59.070
share--well, I could figure it
out more or less.

00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:04.469
The answer is,
you--let me put it this way.

00:45:04.469 --> 00:45:06.659
Let me see if this will help
you understand.

00:45:06.659 --> 00:45:11.455
Suppose Larry Paige calls up
and says, I'd like to buy all of

00:45:11.455 --> 00:45:14.492
the Google shares,
and the broker says,

00:45:14.492 --> 00:45:19.238
alright I'll get them for you.
Then he comes back and says,

00:45:19.238 --> 00:45:23.512
I managed to get all but one
hundred shares and there's this

00:45:23.512 --> 00:45:27.641
one guy--this Yale student--who
owns one hundred shares of

00:45:27.641 --> 00:45:32.059
Google stock and I'm having
trouble getting him to sell.

00:45:32.059 --> 00:45:35.197
So, the broker calls you up and
says, Google wants to buy all of

00:45:35.197 --> 00:45:36.940
its shares--I'm being silly
here.

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:41.690
What do you say to the broker
then?

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:45.785
So, the broker calls you up and
says, you're the last guy,

00:45:45.785 --> 00:45:49.809
you have the last one hundred
shares in Google and Google

00:45:49.809 --> 00:45:53.690
wants to buy them and we'll give
you $500 a share.

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:59.190
So what do you say?
You say no.

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:02.413
Actually, I have a better
thing, you say,

00:46:02.413 --> 00:46:07.168
call Larry Paige and tell him
he's fired because I realize I

00:46:07.168 --> 00:46:10.837
own the company.
If I own the last one hundred

00:46:10.837 --> 00:46:14.099
shares, it's all mine;
I don't have to take any--I can

00:46:14.099 --> 00:46:16.910
do whatever I want.
The last shareholder--so a

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:20.768
company can't buy all of its
shares but it can buy some of

00:46:20.768 --> 00:46:24.559
its shares and that's another
way to get money out of the

00:46:24.559 --> 00:46:28.557
company.
It's a little different if they

00:46:28.557 --> 00:46:34.390
buy--suppose you own a hundred
shares and they declare a 5%

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:37.809
cash dividend,
then you get $5.

00:46:37.809 --> 00:46:43.110
But what if the company buys
back 5% of its shares?

00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:49.236
What happens then?
Well, the company is still

00:46:49.236 --> 00:46:54.719
paying out money in the same
amount total,

00:46:54.719 --> 00:47:00.469
but it's coming out in a
different form;

00:47:00.469 --> 00:47:04.340
it's coming as a share
repurchase.

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:08.360
It's changing the number of
shares outstanding,

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:13.429
so the value of the company
declines by the same amount;

00:47:13.429 --> 00:47:16.840
it has to, as if they had just
paid a dividend.

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.340
If they're sending out money,
the value of the company has to

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:20.840
go down by whatever they sent
out.

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:24.142
With share repurchase,
the number of shares goes down,

00:47:24.142 --> 00:47:27.693
and if they don't do share
repurchase the number of shares

00:47:27.693 --> 00:47:30.246
doesn't go down.
So in a sense,

00:47:30.246 --> 00:47:35.471
it's all the same to me as a
shareholder whether they pay

00:47:35.471 --> 00:47:39.110
dividends or they repurchase
shares.

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:41.340
I don't know how clear that all
was;

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:45.690
let me just write this down.
This idea has a name.

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:50.977
Two authors,
both who won the Nobel Prize in

00:47:50.977 --> 00:47:58.110
finance, Franco--and I know I
was his advisee in my PhD,

00:47:58.110 --> 00:48:00.580
so I learned how to pronounce
his

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:05.213
name–Modigliani--because
in Italian you don't pronounce

00:48:05.213 --> 00:48:09.302
the "g,"
although I tend to say

00:48:09.302 --> 00:48:16.920
Modigliani just to be
understood--and Merton Miller.

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:23.282
Modigliani is one of the
authors of your textbook along

00:48:23.282 --> 00:48:27.108
with Fabozzi.
Modigliani and Miller wrote a

00:48:27.108 --> 00:48:30.798
famous article arguing
that--what I just said--I just

00:48:30.798 --> 00:48:33.849
tried to say it in very
intuitive terms.

00:48:33.849 --> 00:48:45.650
They said, dividend policy is
irrelevant.

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:51.335
Although, they do put it in a
qualifier that it could matter

00:48:51.335 --> 00:48:54.706
for tax reasons.
In fact, you have to put that

00:48:54.706 --> 00:48:58.204
qualifier on just about anything
you say in finance because the

00:48:58.204 --> 00:49:01.759
tax system is infinitely complex
and every country has different

00:49:01.759 --> 00:49:04.329
taxes,
different states have different

00:49:04.329 --> 00:49:06.859
taxes.
There's nothing you can say

00:49:06.859 --> 00:49:09.800
boldly in finance if you allow
taxes.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.969
Well, let's just disregard
taxes.

00:49:11.969 --> 00:49:17.809
When Modigliani--this sounds
like a very strong proposition

00:49:17.809 --> 00:49:24.000
about dividend irrelevance.
What they're saying is that of

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:30.541
course lots of things that a
board of directors decides to do

00:49:30.541 --> 00:49:34.505
are not irrelevant;
it's highly relevant to the

00:49:34.505 --> 00:49:37.490
future of the company.
But real things matter,

00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:41.940
like if the company decides to
build that new plant in Akron.

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:45.322
That matters for the company
because if the plant works out

00:49:45.322 --> 00:49:48.179
to be a success,
then the company will do well.

00:49:48.179 --> 00:49:51.591
They're spending money on
concrete, and bricks,

00:49:51.591 --> 00:49:54.706
and machinery,
and they could be doing that

00:49:54.706 --> 00:49:59.230
wisely or unwisely and that's
beyond finance to evaluate.

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:03.646
What Modigliani and Miller
said, if it's pure dividend

00:50:03.646 --> 00:50:06.980
policy, then it is totally
irrelevant;

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:09.963
it means nothing,
so companies can do whatever

00:50:09.963 --> 00:50:13.926
they please--I don't care.
You, as a stockholder--I don't

00:50:13.926 --> 00:50:17.017
care what they do.
The reason Modigliani and

00:50:17.017 --> 00:50:20.812
Miller said that is that they
were thinking that if the

00:50:20.812 --> 00:50:25.100
dividend policy is going to be
changed without changing any of

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:29.423
the activities of the firm,
keeping it a purely financial

00:50:29.423 --> 00:50:33.715
change, then it must be that
they're switching from dividends

00:50:33.715 --> 00:50:37.719
to stock repurchase or stock
repurchase to dividends.

00:50:37.719 --> 00:50:42.250
You see, you can keep the
operations the same whether or

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:46.125
not you pay a dividend,
if choosing not to pay a

00:50:46.125 --> 00:50:50.590
dividend means substituting
stock repurchase for dividend.

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:54.890
So I'm going to build that
plant in Akron,

00:50:54.890 --> 00:51:01.080
whether I pay a dividend or
not, because if I need to cut my

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:07.374
dividend in order to get the
money to build the plant I would

00:51:07.374 --> 00:51:11.780
also be cutting my stock
repurchase.

00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:14.497
One way or the other it
doesn't--it all comes out to the

00:51:14.497 --> 00:51:16.538
same thing.
Let me put it in the simplest

00:51:16.538 --> 00:51:18.339
way.
I think the simplest way to

00:51:18.339 --> 00:51:21.632
understand Modigliani-Miller
proposition is the following:

00:51:21.632 --> 00:51:24.765
imagine that we,
as a board, decided to pay a

00:51:24.765 --> 00:51:28.526
dividend of $5 a share.
Let's talk in the old days

00:51:28.526 --> 00:51:31.239
about sending checks out,
alright?

00:51:31.239 --> 00:51:35.311
We're going to send a letter to
all our shareholders and say,

00:51:35.311 --> 00:51:39.248
we have decided to pay a $5
dividend and so you're about to

00:51:39.248 --> 00:51:42.706
approve this at the meeting.
We approve a letter--the

00:51:42.706 --> 00:51:45.494
letter's going to say,
we're making money here's your

00:51:45.494 --> 00:51:47.458
dividend check.
Then someone says,

00:51:47.458 --> 00:51:49.289
hey why don't we just change
it?

00:51:49.289 --> 00:51:53.243
Why don't we say the same $5
check is included but,

00:51:53.243 --> 00:51:56.960
in the letter,
let's say something different?

00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:03.005
Let's say this is a repurchase
of some of your shares at market

00:52:03.005 --> 00:52:08.659
price, sending the same check,
so what's the difference?

00:52:08.659 --> 00:52:12.260
Well, I'll ask you,
what difference does it make?

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:15.217
Suppose you get a letter from
your company saying,

00:52:15.217 --> 00:52:18.719
congratulations here's a $5
dividend and here's a check for

00:52:18.719 --> 00:52:22.175
$5 if you owned one share.
Or the company says,

00:52:22.175 --> 00:52:26.370
congratulations we're
repurchasing 2% of your shares

00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:31.059
and here's a check for $5 to pay
you for those shares.

00:52:31.059 --> 00:52:33.680
And by the way,
we're doing that with all

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.865
shares.
Well, if you think about it,

00:52:35.865 --> 00:52:38.030
it doesn't make any difference
to me.

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:41.284
It doesn't matter what that
letter says--I can crumple it up

00:52:41.284 --> 00:52:44.920
and throw it in the wastebasket.
I don't--I want the $5 check.

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:49.635
If they're paying me by sending
money and calling it a dividend

00:52:49.635 --> 00:52:54.349
it's the same as if they say
they're repurchasing my shares.

00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:57.219
Because it's--repurchasing my
shares, if they do it for

00:52:57.219 --> 00:52:59.079
everybody, doesn't mean
anything.

00:52:59.079 --> 00:53:02.546
I'm getting--we're all
lowering--all of our shares are

00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:07.472
going down by the same amount.
So, that's the basic insight in

00:53:07.472 --> 00:53:11.766
Modigliani and Miller,
that share repurchase and

00:53:11.766 --> 00:53:15.329
dividend are really
interchangeable;

00:53:15.329 --> 00:53:17.269
it's just all a conceptual
difference.

00:53:17.269 --> 00:53:20.659
This kind of took people by
surprise.

00:53:20.659 --> 00:53:23.014
It's kind of--it should be
obvious, I'm making it so

00:53:23.014 --> 00:53:24.867
simple.
I could write some mathematics

00:53:24.867 --> 00:53:27.360
to try and--but I think it's so
simple and obvious.

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:30.877
You just have to keep
remembering that all that

00:53:30.877 --> 00:53:35.619
matters for a company--for you
as a--your interest in a company

00:53:35.619 --> 00:53:40.590
depends on your shares divided
by the total number of shares.

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:43.584
In a stock repurchase,
if they repurchase everybody's

00:53:43.584 --> 00:53:47.039
shares--the same proportion--it
doesn't affect that ratio.

00:53:47.039 --> 00:53:51.209
So, you don't care what the
letter says--whether it says

00:53:51.209 --> 00:53:56.847
dividend or stock repurchase.
Why would a company want to do

00:53:56.847 --> 00:54:00.085
one or the other?
Well, Modigliani and Miller are

00:54:00.085 --> 00:54:02.809
leaving the room;
they say it doesn't matter.

00:54:02.809 --> 00:54:06.269
If you ask them why a dividend
payout policy has

00:54:06.269 --> 00:54:10.759
changed--there's a famous Miller
quote--he calls it a "neutral

00:54:10.759 --> 00:54:11.790
mutation,"

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.465
as a reference to evolutionary
biology, that sometimes

00:54:22.465 --> 00:54:25.929
mutations are neither
advantageous nor deleterious.

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:31.079
The genome starts piling on
mutations that mean nothing;

00:54:31.079 --> 00:54:34.736
that's how they date the
branches of the genome,

00:54:34.736 --> 00:54:38.469
by looking at the number of
neutral mutations.

00:54:38.469 --> 00:54:41.785
He said all this--this thing
that I have up here--well the

00:54:41.785 --> 00:54:44.344
previous slide,
showing the dividend earnings

00:54:44.344 --> 00:54:48.282
ratio--it's just cultural;
it means nothing because,

00:54:48.282 --> 00:54:51.702
to some extent,
what's not shown in that

00:54:51.702 --> 00:54:54.860
diagram was the stock
repurchase.

00:54:54.860 --> 00:55:01.534
I want then finally to talk
about Modigliani-Miller and

00:55:01.534 --> 00:55:03.950
debt.
Now, I didn't talk too much

00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:05.952
about debt yet.
Before I talk,

00:55:05.952 --> 00:55:10.282
I just want to say one more
thing about Modigliani-Miller

00:55:10.282 --> 00:55:13.530
and dividend--irrelevance of
dividends.

00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:19.030
There is a possible correction
to be made due to taxes.

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:24.395
When Modigliani and Miller
wrote, there was a differential

00:55:24.395 --> 00:55:28.820
tax rate between dividends and
capital gains.

00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:33.749
It was--Modigliani and Miller
said back then--this was thirty

00:55:33.749 --> 00:55:38.268
or forty years ago--that
companies should really not pay

00:55:38.268 --> 00:55:43.526
dividends because dividends were
then taxed at a higher rate than

00:55:43.526 --> 00:55:48.599
capital gains.
You don't want to give your

00:55:48.599 --> 00:55:53.107
shareholders taxes.
You should, in your fiduciary

00:55:53.107 --> 00:55:56.702
duties as a board member,
be trying to help them lower

00:55:56.702 --> 00:55:59.754
their taxes.
It doesn't say that in the

00:55:59.754 --> 00:56:03.510
state law but that would be
inferred as a duty.

00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:07.375
So, you would avoid paying
dividends and,

00:56:07.375 --> 00:56:12.690
therefore, switch to share
repurchase as your method.

00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:16.276
It took decades for
Modigliani-Miller to kind of

00:56:16.276 --> 00:56:18.136
sink in.
As you can see,

00:56:18.136 --> 00:56:21.279
part of the reason why the
dividend-earnings

00:56:21.279 --> 00:56:24.349
ratio--especially in more recent
years,

00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:28.948
since 1990--has been declining
is that corporations were trying

00:56:28.948 --> 00:56:33.473
to somewhat ease the tax burden
on their shareholders by doing

00:56:33.473 --> 00:56:39.342
repurchase instead of dividend.
However, that all changed in

00:56:39.342 --> 00:56:46.590
2003 with the Jobs and Growth
Tax Reconciliation Act of 2003,

00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:51.123
which cut the rate of taxation
of dividends to 15%--the same

00:56:51.123 --> 00:56:53.889
rate that capital gains are
taxed.

00:56:53.889 --> 00:56:56.810
There is now no
preference--well it could

00:56:56.810 --> 00:57:00.680
be--there are lots of
complexities in the tax law but,

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:04.769
basically, dividend policy
really is irrelevant now.

00:57:04.769 --> 00:57:08.600
If there's no tax advantage to
one over the other it is

00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:13.365
completely neutral.
The other thing that I want to

00:57:13.365 --> 00:57:19.590
say about Modigliani and Miller
is about corporate debt.

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:37.488
I talked about a company as
having only shares outstanding,

00:57:37.488 --> 00:57:40.180
but they also have debt
outstanding.

00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:45.724
So, a company can borrow money.
If a company borrows a lot of

00:57:45.724 --> 00:57:53.822
money it's called "leveraged."
Leverage is measured by the

00:57:53.822 --> 00:57:59.550
debt-equity ratio.
Now, D here stands for debt;

00:57:59.550 --> 00:58:05.599
a minute ago I was using Div to
stand for dividends.

00:58:05.599 --> 00:58:10.977
They both start with the letter
D but they're very different

00:58:10.977 --> 00:58:13.978
concepts.
The debt of a company is the

00:58:13.978 --> 00:58:18.189
amount of money it owes either
to banks, or to bond holders,

00:58:18.189 --> 00:58:21.830
or to note holders,
or commercial paper holders;

00:58:21.830 --> 00:58:25.897
these are fixed incomes.
In other words,

00:58:25.897 --> 00:58:27.500
they are not shares in the
company.

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:35.643
When a company becomes
leveraged, it then becomes

00:58:35.643 --> 00:58:40.556
riskier.
The company becomes riskier

00:58:40.556 --> 00:58:47.823
because the earnings they have
available after paying interest

00:58:47.823 --> 00:58:52.620
on the debt,
or repayment of principle of

00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:58.320
the debt, is what they have
available for dividends.

00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:05.168
If debt becomes high relative
to their revenue stream then the

00:59:05.168 --> 00:59:09.210
company is in a riskier
situation.

00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:18.091
There's another
Modigliani-Miller theorem about

00:59:18.091 --> 00:59:27.360
debt, which is about debt
irrelevance as well.

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:30.636
That sounds funny,
but in a sense,

00:59:30.636 --> 00:59:36.989
that is--we have to define the
sense in which it's irrelevant.

00:59:36.989 --> 00:59:42.239
It certainly isn't irrelevant
to the price of a share.

00:59:42.239 --> 00:59:47.899
The more money a company
borrows the more risky the share

00:59:47.899 --> 00:59:52.357
becomes.
It's just like if you buy a

00:59:52.357 --> 01:00:00.019
house and you buy - a lot of
people are very leveraged now.

01:00:00.019 --> 01:00:05.030
They might put only 10% down on
a house, so you buy a house for

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:07.940
$300,000 and you put $30,000
down;

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:13.361
that's an investment of $30,000
but it's highly risky because

01:00:13.361 --> 01:00:18.059
you are very leveraged when you
only put 10% down.

01:00:18.059 --> 01:00:21.715
Suppose the home price falls by
only 10%--in fact,

01:00:21.715 --> 01:00:24.550
that's what's been happening
lately.

01:00:24.550 --> 01:00:29.248
Your $30,000 down payment is
completely wiped out because you

01:00:29.248 --> 01:00:32.104
were leveraged.
You bought the house for

01:00:32.104 --> 01:00:35.192
$300,000;
you sell it for $270,000 that's

01:00:35.192 --> 01:00:38.990
exactly what you owe,
so you have nothing left.

01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:45.624
So, leverage brings risk.
Boards of directors have long

01:00:45.624 --> 01:00:51.718
agonized over how much to borrow
and different companies seem to

01:00:51.718 --> 01:00:56.182
have different cultures.
For example,

01:00:56.182 --> 01:01:05.905
Microsoft has avoided borrowing
any money and they don't believe

01:01:05.905 --> 01:01:11.769
in debt, so they are not
leveraged.

01:01:11.769 --> 01:01:17.039
But other companies get heavily
indebted and then they can go

01:01:17.039 --> 01:01:21.335
through big problems.
It's a very common item of

01:01:21.335 --> 01:01:25.973
discussion at board meetings
about how much should our

01:01:25.973 --> 01:01:29.387
company borrow,
so they seek advice from

01:01:29.387 --> 01:01:34.589
financial experts.
They call in Modigliani and

01:01:34.589 --> 01:01:39.670
Miller and ask,
how much should we borrow?

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:43.471
What do finance theorists say?
In the extreme case,

01:01:43.471 --> 01:01:48.873
where we disregard taxes and we
have to disregard some other

01:01:48.873 --> 01:01:52.170
problems, we get the same
answer.

01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:55.277
Modigliani and Miller said,
we don't care what you do,

01:01:55.277 --> 01:01:57.739
do whatever you want--it
doesn't matter.

01:01:57.739 --> 01:02:04.059
This is what I want you to
think about on the problem set.

01:02:04.059 --> 01:02:08.605
Or, maybe speaking about the
answer to the questions on the

01:02:08.605 --> 01:02:12.760
Problem Set #4 will help you to
think this through.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:17.770
The simplest way to see
Modigliani-Miller debt

01:02:17.770 --> 01:02:24.451
irrelevance is the following:
a company--if you wanted to buy

01:02:24.451 --> 01:02:28.966
a company,
you could buy only the shares,

01:02:28.966 --> 01:02:32.028
or equity.
Incidentally,

01:02:32.028 --> 01:02:38.268
did I ever--equity equals
shares or stock,

01:02:38.268 --> 01:02:44.659
so when I talk about
debt-equity ratio,

01:02:44.659 --> 01:02:46.966
I'm talking about the ratio of
the value of the company's debt

01:02:46.966 --> 01:02:48.290
to the value of all of its
stock.

01:02:56.719 --> 01:02:59.478
If you wanted to buy a company
up and own it yourself

01:02:59.478 --> 01:03:02.713
completely, you could conceive
of buying all the shares in the

01:03:02.713 --> 01:03:04.825
company.
There are ten million shares

01:03:04.825 --> 01:03:07.460
outstanding--I'm going to buy
ten million shares.

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:09.937
But in a sense,
I don't really own the whole

01:03:09.937 --> 01:03:12.530
company yet because the company
owes money.

01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:15.177
What if I wanted to buy the
whole kit and caboodle--the

01:03:15.177 --> 01:03:17.935
whole operation?
I should be buying all the

01:03:17.935 --> 01:03:20.820
equity and all the debt as well,
right?

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:24.460
If the company issued--if I
really want to own it and I have

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:28.099
no--I really wanted to be the
tycoon and this is my baby,

01:03:28.099 --> 01:03:30.949
nobody else can get in my
backyard;

01:03:30.949 --> 01:03:34.906
I can do whatever I want--you'd
have to buy all the equity and

01:03:34.906 --> 01:03:37.886
all the debt.
Otherwise, if you don't buy all

01:03:37.886 --> 01:03:41.446
the debt, you still have a
problem because those debtors

01:03:41.446 --> 01:03:45.200
can go after you because they
are--they're not shareholders

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.890
but they have rights and they
could come in and say,

01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:51.461
we don't like what you're doing;
we're going to sue you because

01:03:51.461 --> 01:03:53.962
we think that you're doing
something contrary to our

01:03:53.962 --> 01:03:56.691
interest as debtors.
If you really want to buy the

01:03:56.691 --> 01:03:59.840
company, you buy up all its
equity--all of its shares--and

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:03.204
all of its debt.
The basic insight about

01:04:03.204 --> 01:04:07.834
Modigliani and Miller debt
irrelevance is that,

01:04:07.834 --> 01:04:13.269
in the absence of taxes or any
other special thing,

01:04:13.269 --> 01:04:17.748
the real value of the company
is going to be unaffected by

01:04:17.748 --> 01:04:22.698
whether they finance by debt or
by equity because the real value

01:04:22.698 --> 01:04:27.491
of a company is determined by
the cash flow that they generate

01:04:27.491 --> 01:04:32.530
by the business they're doing.
So, they are selling widgets or

01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:36.594
whatever and making money--the
value of the company is the

01:04:36.594 --> 01:04:41.274
present value of that cash flow.
If you want to buy the company

01:04:41.274 --> 01:04:45.059
you have to buy up all the debt
and all the equity.

01:04:45.059 --> 01:04:48.538
From the standpoint of a buyer
of the whole company,

01:04:48.538 --> 01:04:51.880
what do I care how the
ownership of the company is

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.539
divided up between debt and
equity?

01:04:54.539 --> 01:04:58.550
I have to buy them all anyway,
so I don't care whether

01:04:58.550 --> 01:05:02.939
three-fourths of my money goes
to debt or one-fourth of the

01:05:02.939 --> 01:05:06.121
money goes to debt.
I just want to know the bottom

01:05:06.121 --> 01:05:08.143
line;
how much do I have to pay for

01:05:08.143 --> 01:05:12.072
the whole company?
The debt irrelevance theory

01:05:12.072 --> 01:05:18.174
says that it matters for the
price of a share what a company

01:05:18.174 --> 01:05:24.277
issues--how much debt it takes
on--but it doesn't matter for

01:05:24.277 --> 01:05:29.879
the value of the company.
There's almost an arithmetic

01:05:29.879 --> 01:05:33.539
relationship theory that they
put forth.

01:05:33.539 --> 01:05:37.384
I'm not going to go through
their numbers but the value of

01:05:37.384 --> 01:05:40.554
the company, as a whole,
is really determined by

01:05:40.554 --> 01:05:47.323
something outside of finance.
Again, we have to qualify the

01:05:47.323 --> 01:05:51.710
debt irrelevance for taxes.

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:08.270
So, companies might be
concerned with the fact that

01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:18.542
debt is tax-deductible for
corporations on their corporate

01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:25.389
profits tax but dividends are
not.

01:06:25.389 --> 01:06:30.060
According to Modigliani and
Miller, if you add taxes to

01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:33.260
their debt irrelevance
proposition,

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:37.492
it means that companies will
want to borrow a lot and the

01:06:37.492 --> 01:06:41.196
real advice they would be giving
to Bill Gates is:

01:06:41.196 --> 01:06:45.980
what's the matter with you?
Why aren't you borrowing money?

01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:52.110
It's tax deductible,
whereas dividends are not.

01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:58.270
That would mean that companies
should try to push their

01:06:58.270 --> 01:07:05.230
debt-equity ratio up as high as
possible given that theory.

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:07.494
On the other hand,
if they do so,

01:07:07.494 --> 01:07:09.900
they may be courting
bankruptcy.

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:14.314
If the company gets too
leveraged then there's too high

01:07:14.314 --> 01:07:19.383
a probability that the company
will fail and there are costs to

01:07:19.383 --> 01:07:24.220
bankruptcy.
The other qualification is

01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:28.658
bankruptcy costs.
A company, according to

01:07:28.658 --> 01:07:32.368
Modigliani and Miller,
has to weigh their tax

01:07:32.368 --> 01:07:37.004
considerations against their
bankruptcy costs and get an

01:07:37.004 --> 01:07:40.630
optimum debt-equity ratio out of
that.

01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:43.956
It is an insight that
Modigliani and Miller are

01:07:43.956 --> 01:07:48.512
offering the corporations that I
think they often don't see that

01:07:48.512 --> 01:07:52.273
the real issue in the
dividend--both the dividend and

01:07:52.273 --> 01:07:56.539
the debt policies--are really
taxes and nothing else.

01:07:56.539 --> 01:08:03.829
The last thing,
I just wanted to say--I wanted

01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:12.416
to mention the theory of
dividend payout given by John

01:08:12.416 --> 01:08:16.032
Lintner;
it's called the Lintner Model

01:08:16.032 --> 01:08:16.840
of Dividends.

01:08:21.239 --> 01:08:25.408
I'm saying that,
unless tax considerations

01:08:25.408 --> 01:08:31.609
intervene, dividend policy is
really irrelevant for a firm.

01:08:31.609 --> 01:08:36.678
Maybe Merton Miller is
right--these things are "neutral

01:08:36.678 --> 01:08:42.310
mutations" and changes in
dividend policy are meaningless.

01:08:42.310 --> 01:08:46.001
But how do they actually do it?
How do boards and their

01:08:46.001 --> 01:08:49.510
committees decide how much to
pay out in dividends?

01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:54.086
John Lintner was a professor at
the Harvard Business School,

01:08:54.086 --> 01:08:57.340
who, decades ago,
did a survey of people who

01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:01.450
decide on dividends and asked
them, what goes on in your mind

01:09:01.450 --> 01:09:05.560
and what do you think about when
you decide on dividends?

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:10.242
He had a long discussion;
they said millions of different

01:09:10.242 --> 01:09:13.864
things--it's very hard.
People who decide on dividends

01:09:13.864 --> 01:09:18.584
are facing a complicated issue.
One thing that Merton Miller

01:09:18.584 --> 01:09:22.180
(sic) distilled from it was that
people on boards,

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:26.065
who decide on dividend payout,
are very focused on the price

01:09:26.065 --> 01:09:29.819
of a share and they're worried
about investor reaction.

01:09:29.819 --> 01:09:33.220
Boards always want to keep
their price of a share up

01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:37.086
because if it starts to decline,
the company could become a

01:09:37.086 --> 01:09:40.528
takeover target;
it's viewed as a failure etc.,

01:09:40.528 --> 01:09:43.456
etc.
They talked a lot to him about

01:09:43.456 --> 01:09:47.423
investor psychology.
In a sense, I'm terminating

01:09:47.423 --> 01:09:51.188
this lecture with another
triumph for behavioral

01:09:51.188 --> 01:09:54.107
economics.
When we think about the theory

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:57.674
of dividend or debt we end up
with irrelevance--it doesn't

01:09:57.674 --> 01:10:00.990
mean anything--but the
companies' boards talk about it

01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:04.369
incessantly and it seems to
matter a lot to them.

01:10:04.369 --> 01:10:07.622
If you ask them why it matters,
they say, well it's pretty

01:10:07.622 --> 01:10:11.216
obvious--it's all their investor
psychology that we have to deal

01:10:11.216 --> 01:10:13.400
with.
They say things like this:

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.483
if we pay a dividend,
then they're going to start

01:10:16.483 --> 01:10:19.015
expecting that.
And if we don't pay a dividend

01:10:19.015 --> 01:10:21.170
once, then they're going to say,
what's wrong?

01:10:21.170 --> 01:10:23.488
As long as we never start
paying a dividend,

01:10:23.488 --> 01:10:26.939
then we're just a young company
and nobody asks any questions.

01:10:26.939 --> 01:10:30.931
Then we start paying a dividend
and then if we ever have to cut

01:10:30.931 --> 01:10:33.928
it, we're in big trouble.
The newspaper reporters will

01:10:33.928 --> 01:10:35.949
start calling,
why did you cut the dividend?

01:10:35.949 --> 01:10:38.846
You said, you didn't call us up
when we weren't paying any

01:10:38.846 --> 01:10:41.691
dividend and now we're still
paying more than we used to,

01:10:41.691 --> 01:10:44.577
why all this alarm?
They said--one of the lessons

01:10:44.577 --> 01:10:47.480
they were told is,
never cut a dividend unless you

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:50.619
do it as a--you could do a one
time only dividend.

01:10:50.619 --> 01:10:53.640
Say, we're just doing this once
and don't expect it again.

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:56.600
But if you start paying regular
dividends, then you better keep

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.418
doing them or people are going
to conclude that something is

01:10:59.418 --> 01:11:02.569
really wrong.
They told him that if earnings

01:11:02.569 --> 01:11:07.171
go up--we try to keep a target
payout ratio--but if earnings

01:11:07.171 --> 01:11:10.129
suddenly shoot up,
we're not going to increase our

01:11:10.129 --> 01:11:12.428
dividends right away because
that would set too high an

01:11:12.428 --> 01:11:14.600
expectation and we don't want to
have to cut it.

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:17.843
So if earnings go up a lot,
we'll raise our dividends,

01:11:17.843 --> 01:11:23.227
but only part of the way up.
The model that–I better

01:11:23.227 --> 01:11:30.201
get it right--the Lintner Model
says that there's a target

01:11:30.201 --> 01:11:37.542
payout ratio--that's the Greek
letter tau (τ) and that's

01:11:37.542 --> 01:11:43.671
the target payout ratio.
That ratio may have been higher

01:11:43.671 --> 01:11:47.330
in the nineteenth century;
it's gradually trending down,

01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:50.050
but it's a slow-moving thing.
So they want to payout

01:11:50.050 --> 01:11:53.317
something like 40% of their
earnings as dividends and plow

01:11:53.317 --> 01:11:56.239
the rest back into investing
inside the company.

01:11:56.239 --> 01:12:01.493
Then there's another parameter,
rho (ρ),

01:12:01.493 --> 01:12:08.060
which is the adjustment--rho is
between zero and one.

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:14.409
It's how fast they adjust to
the target.

01:12:14.409 --> 01:12:23.685
So the Lintner Model then says,
the change in dividends,

01:12:23.685 --> 01:12:30.936
Div_t - Div_T-1
= ρ

01:12:30.936 --> 01:12:39.199
(E_t - Div _T
– 1).

01:12:39.199 --> 01:12:44.837
That means that if your rho is
from a positive number like

01:12:44.837 --> 01:12:50.375
half--so if earnings is above
dividends you increase your

01:12:50.375 --> 01:12:54.273
dividends,
but only by half as much as

01:12:54.273 --> 01:12:59.020
would bring it up to the target,
if rho is a half.

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:05.940
That means there's a gradual
adjustment of dividends to

01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:08.997
earnings.
For example,

01:13:08.997 --> 01:13:16.959
if this is tau and this is
earnings--if your earnings were,

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:19.652
say,
flat and suddenly increased

01:13:19.652 --> 01:13:23.310
like that, they wouldn't believe
this increase at first,

01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:25.933
so the board would decide to
adjust only, say,

01:13:25.933 --> 01:13:28.930
half way up.
Now I'm plotting dividends.

01:13:28.930 --> 01:13:33.073
The dividends were down here at
half the earnings and then you

01:13:33.073 --> 01:13:37.149
would gradually adjust them up
to half the earnings again.

01:13:37.149 --> 01:13:40.550
That's because they don't want
to ever be caught cutting their

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:43.302
dividends.
Also, if the earnings drop,

01:13:43.302 --> 01:13:47.928
they don't want to suddenly do
a crash cut in their dividends

01:13:47.928 --> 01:13:50.416
either,
so they're always sluggishly

01:13:50.416 --> 01:13:52.930
adjusting toward the target
payout rate.

01:13:52.930 --> 01:13:57.946
Lintner showed that this simple
model--the Lintner

01:13:57.946 --> 01:14:03.680
Model--explains the behavior of
companies pretty well.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:12.354
Next session is Friday with
Stephen Schwarzman and I'll see

01:14:12.354 --> 01:14:13.354
you then.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.941
Professor Mark Saltzman:
So, this week we're going

00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:18.360
to talk about drug delivery,
this is Chapter 14.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.579
This is an example of what I
call in the textbook

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.654
Biomolecular Engineering.
This is one of my favorite

00:00:25.654 --> 00:00:30.618
weeks of the course because this
is my research specialty,

00:00:30.618 --> 00:00:34.558
is drug delivery.
What I want to do today,

00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:39.687
Thursday, and then we'll
continue in section is today I'm

00:00:39.687 --> 00:00:43.260
going to sort of set up the
problem,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.936
talk about some definitions to
think about, if one is building

00:00:45.936 --> 00:00:48.951
drug delivery systems,
think about some basic concepts

00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:51.953
in drug delivery.
We're going to do that by

00:00:51.953 --> 00:00:56.501
thinking about sort of common
modes of drug administration and

00:00:56.501 --> 00:01:01.049
why some of them work with some
drugs and not with others,

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:03.399
sort of lay the foundations
today.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.938
Then, on Thursday we'll talk
about what's new in drug

00:01:06.938 --> 00:01:10.750
delivery and what things you can
expect in the future,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.338
things that are still being
built and then you'll get to

00:01:14.338 --> 00:01:17.796
make some drug delivery systems
in section on Thursday

00:01:17.796 --> 00:01:20.992
afternoon.
This is really a logical

00:01:20.992 --> 00:01:25.801
extension of what we started
talking about last week when we

00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:30.040
moved from talking about the
immune system and how it

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.441
operates to administration
intentionally of vaccines to

00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:39.739
alter the immune system or to
change your body's response.

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:42.671
In some senses,
you could think about delivery

00:01:42.671 --> 00:01:46.580
of a vaccine like delivery of a
drug or introducing something

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.555
not naturally in the body--into
the body in order to have some

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:54.861
kind of biological effect.
It's the same thing as delivery

00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:57.770
of a drug.
And we also thought about

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.776
delivery in a variety of ways:
we thought about injection of

00:02:02.776 --> 00:02:06.000
vaccines like the smallpox
vaccine,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.591
we thought about oral
administration of vaccine,

00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:14.500
in the case of the oral polio
vaccine.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.771
So, I just wanted to show you
this picture to remind you that

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:22.259
you already know something about
drug delivery.

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:24.960
What we're going to talk about
is an extension of what we

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.739
started talking about last week.
Now, in the case of a

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.762
vaccine, you'll remember,
that the intent was to

00:02:32.762 --> 00:02:37.051
administer either proteins,
usually proteins or whole

00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:41.320
viruses, or we talked at the end
of the class on Thursday about

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.175
administering DNA with the
intention that you're going to

00:02:45.175 --> 00:02:49.306
bring some new molecules into a
special class of cells called

00:02:49.306 --> 00:02:53.361
antigen presenting cells.
That those antigen presenting

00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:57.191
cells are going to be changed as
a result of their experience

00:02:57.191 --> 00:03:01.150
with this vaccine such that they
present new molecules on their

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.756
surface,
that's the change that comes

00:03:03.756 --> 00:03:06.217
about.
Then, that change in this cell

00:03:06.217 --> 00:03:09.310
is going to stimulate changes in
other cells.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.930
If humoral immune response or
antibody mediated immune

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.872
response is generated,
then the change in antigen

00:03:15.872 --> 00:03:18.276
presenting cells is going to
influence B-cells to

00:03:18.276 --> 00:03:22.000
differentiate and proliferate,
etc.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.266
This is an example of a
very particular example of what

00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:27.800
happens when you administer a
drug as well.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.253
Chemicals are introduced into
the body, the intent is usually

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:36.112
to make some kind of a
biochemical change in cells or

00:03:36.112 --> 00:03:40.417
maybe many cells in your body
such that they're function is

00:03:40.417 --> 00:03:43.979
altered in some way that's
helpful to you.

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:47.090
We didn't really talk about it
last week, but in some cases

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.449
immunization really is like drug
delivery.

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:52.076
Particularly,
in the case of what's called

00:03:52.076 --> 00:03:55.343
passive immunization,
where instead of introducing a

00:03:55.343 --> 00:03:58.738
pathogen or a piece of a
pathogen to an individual you

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:02.389
actually make antibodies outside
of the individual.

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.395
So, manufacture them in some
ways, and we talked about ways

00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:07.780
of manufacturing antibodies a
few weeks ago.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.872
Then introduce those antibodies
themselves into the person to

00:04:11.872 --> 00:04:15.214
provide protection against
whatever pathogen those

00:04:15.214 --> 00:04:20.365
antibodies are directed against.
If any of you have traveled

00:04:20.365 --> 00:04:24.800
to areas of the world where
Hepatitis A is common,

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.454
in parts of Asia for example,
you might have gotten a shot of

00:04:29.454 --> 00:04:33.644
gamma globulin which is really
just antibodies that are

00:04:33.644 --> 00:04:36.980
enriched for anti-Hepatitis A
activity.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.600
Now, the difference between
that and a vaccine is that that

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.221
dose of antibodies only lasts
for a certain length of time,

00:04:44.221 --> 00:04:47.443
about 30 to 60 days.
So, you have to get the shot 30

00:04:47.443 --> 00:04:50.778
to 60 days before you're going
to be in the area where you're

00:04:50.778 --> 00:04:52.910
exposed.
The same way we're going to

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.459
think a lot about the timing of
drugs, how long do their effects

00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:58.564
last,
what determines how long they

00:04:58.564 --> 00:05:02.102
last, and what does it mean if
you still need the drug when its

00:05:02.102 --> 00:05:04.444
effect is gone,
how does taking subsequent

00:05:04.444 --> 00:05:07.580
quantities of the drug effect
its concentration in your body,

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.329
for example.
I'm going to start with

00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:15.885
some definitions and I realize
that you can read this on your

00:05:15.885 --> 00:05:18.109
own.
Hopefully you already have read

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:21.437
some of this in the chapter,
but just to make sure that we

00:05:21.437 --> 00:05:24.167
have the vocabulary right,
and some of these are words

00:05:24.167 --> 00:05:25.589
that you're familiar with like
drug.

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:29.310
A drug is any molecule which
can be introduced into the body,

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.410
which alters body function on a
molecular level.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.600
You're used to thinking about
drugs you might take for a

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.420
headache like aspirin or
Ibuprofen.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.808
Or if you asthma,
for example,

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:46.339
you might take drugs that
affect your bronchioles or the

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:51.116
pathways--the airways in your
lung by dilating them so it's

00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:55.966
easier to get air in and out.
These are molecules which are

00:05:55.966 --> 00:06:00.119
introduced into the body;
they make some kind of change

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:02.920
in the body on a molecular
level.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.501
Pharmacology is the science
of dealing with these

00:06:05.501 --> 00:06:08.579
interactions of molecules that
are introduced into the body.

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:12.847
They're usually molecules that
are generated from outside the

00:06:12.847 --> 00:06:15.550
body, maybe synthesized in some
way.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.362
They might be molecules that
are not ordinarily found in our

00:06:19.362 --> 00:06:22.269
bodies, but are known to have
some effects.

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:25.364
They might be derivatives of
molecules that are naturally

00:06:25.364 --> 00:06:27.274
found in our bodies.
For example,

00:06:27.274 --> 00:06:30.282
Parkinson's disease is treated
by a derivative of the

00:06:30.282 --> 00:06:33.758
neurotransmitter Dopamine.
You're introducing something

00:06:33.758 --> 00:06:37.419
that looks very much like a
natural molecule back into the

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:40.861
body to have an effect.
Toxicology is that branch

00:06:40.861 --> 00:06:44.403
of pharmacology that thinks
exclusively about toxic effects

00:06:44.403 --> 00:06:47.305
of the drug.
One of the main challenges with

00:06:47.305 --> 00:06:50.828
developing drugs and drug
delivery systems is that drugs

00:06:50.828 --> 00:06:54.650
have unwanted effects.
They have the effect that you

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.785
desire at the tissue or within
the cells that they were

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:02.153
designed to affect,
but they can also effects in

00:07:02.153 --> 00:07:05.759
other parts of the body and
those effects are side-effects.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:11.391
Those effects are toxicities or
unwanted changes in the body as

00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:15.596
a result of the drug.
We're going to talk about

00:07:15.596 --> 00:07:19.247
two important different but
related concepts called

00:07:19.247 --> 00:07:22.240
pharmacodynamics and
pharmacokinetics.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.698
Pharmacodynamics is the effect
of a drug on a body and it's

00:07:25.698 --> 00:07:28.560
usually on the body or on cells
from the body.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.529
It's usually defined by a
dose-response curve.

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:34.621
Dose response means I give a
certain amount of the drug and I

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.544
see what effect it has.
I give more,

00:07:36.544 --> 00:07:39.505
I see what effect that has,
I give more I see what effect

00:07:39.505 --> 00:07:41.832
that has.
You can imagine that's a very

00:07:41.832 --> 00:07:45.158
important thing to define for
any drug because you want to

00:07:45.158 --> 00:07:48.659
deliver the minimum dose that's
needed to produce the desired

00:07:48.659 --> 00:07:50.760
effect.
You don't want to introduce any

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.447
more than necessary.
So, understanding the

00:07:53.447 --> 00:07:56.854
relationship between dose
delivered and biological

00:07:56.854 --> 00:08:01.275
response is very important.
Often that's done first on

00:08:01.275 --> 00:08:04.060
cells in culture,
for example.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.501
You want to understand how a
chemotherapy agent,

00:08:07.501 --> 00:08:11.894
a potential agent for treating
tumors will affect tumors in a

00:08:11.894 --> 00:08:14.656
person.
The first thing you do is you

00:08:14.656 --> 00:08:18.704
might have cultured tumor cells
and you expose those cells to

00:08:18.704 --> 00:08:22.954
different concentrations of the
drug and you see at what dose do

00:08:22.954 --> 00:08:27.069
I begin to see cell death or
killing of the tumor cells.

00:08:27.069 --> 00:08:29.740
That's one kind of dose
response relationship.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.378
Now, you could understand,
probably, that that might be

00:08:33.378 --> 00:08:37.690
very different if you administer
that same dose into a person.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.734
We're going to talk about why
dose responses in people are

00:08:41.734 --> 00:08:44.997
different than dose responses in
cell cultures,

00:08:44.997 --> 00:08:49.183
or in more artificial systems.
The pharmacodynamic effect

00:08:49.183 --> 00:08:51.725
of a drug, or the study of
pharmacodynamics,

00:08:51.725 --> 00:08:54.149
is 'what does the drug do to
the body?

00:08:54.149 --> 00:08:57.748
' Usually that's defined at
specific doses,

00:08:57.748 --> 00:09:01.405
what does it do.
Pharmacokinetics has to do with

00:09:01.405 --> 00:09:05.776
how your body handles the drug.
The body has exquisite

00:09:05.776 --> 00:09:09.850
mechanisms for getting rid of
molecules.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.906
Molecules that are produced
naturally in your body only have

00:09:13.906 --> 00:09:17.126
a certain lifetime.
Likewise, antibodies that

00:09:17.126 --> 00:09:21.604
we--molecules that we introduced
from outside the body also have

00:09:21.604 --> 00:09:24.269
a lifetime,
and that depends on the

00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:28.480
mechanism that your body uses to
get rid of the compound.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.150
Well, that manner in which the
body handles a drug,

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:37.944
how the body changes the drug,
how it excretes the drug is

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:41.953
called pharmacokinetics and that
has to do with what the body

00:09:41.953 --> 00:09:44.971
does to the drug,
not what the drug does to the

00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:48.170
body.
That's the easiest way to think

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.992
about it.
One pharmacokinetic concept

00:09:50.992 --> 00:09:54.490
that's very important is the
concept of bioavailability.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:58.544
If I have a dose of the drug,
let's say 100 milligrams of a

00:09:58.544 --> 00:10:01.690
drug, and I administer it to an
individual,

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:07.384
then how much of that drug
actually gets into the body

00:10:07.384 --> 00:10:11.856
where it can be useful?
Bioavailability is going to

00:10:11.856 --> 00:10:14.370
depend on how we administer the
drug.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.391
If we administer it orally
versus inject it intravenously,

00:10:18.391 --> 00:10:22.554
versus some of the other routes
of administration we'll talk

00:10:22.554 --> 00:10:27.055
about in a few minutes.
The main effect of changing the

00:10:27.055 --> 00:10:31.912
route of administration is to
change the bioavailability or

00:10:31.912 --> 00:10:36.769
how much of the drug actually
reaches the active sites.

00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:40.700
A related concept is
biotransformation.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.974
Biotransformation refers to all
the mechanisms that your body

00:10:45.974 --> 00:10:50.370
could use to convert a drug into
something else.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.339
Often, that conversion of a
drug into something else is an

00:10:54.339 --> 00:10:58.029
important part of how your body
gets rid of a drug.

00:10:58.029 --> 00:11:03.259
Many biotransformation
reactions happen in the liver.

00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:07.576
The liver is a very active site
of metabolism and chemical

00:11:07.576 --> 00:11:10.842
reaction.
Many drugs that we take are

00:11:10.842 --> 00:11:14.717
converted into other compounds
in the liver,

00:11:14.717 --> 00:11:18.811
by cells in the liver.
Often, this conversion into

00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:22.970
another compound is the first
step in your body getting rid of

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.269
it;
sometimes it's the only step.

00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:28.666
Sometimes your liver is able to
convert a molecule into

00:11:28.666 --> 00:11:31.120
something that's completely
inactive.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.840
For example,
if you take alcohol,

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.495
which is a drug,
it's converted in the liver

00:11:37.495 --> 00:11:42.679
into other molecules which don't
have the biological effect of

00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:45.943
alcohol.
It's done by enzymes in liver

00:11:45.943 --> 00:11:50.090
cells, including the enzyme
alcohol dehydrogenase.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:54.510
Sometimes--we won't talk so
much about this but I want you

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:58.894
to at least realize it,
is that sometimes we deliver

00:11:58.894 --> 00:12:03.870
molecules that are inactive but
don't have any response.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.026
Your body doesn't have any
response to them,

00:12:06.026 --> 00:12:08.734
but we deliver them knowing
that your liver is going to

00:12:08.734 --> 00:12:10.690
convert them into something
active,

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:14.264
that they're going to be
biotransformed by some chemical

00:12:14.264 --> 00:12:16.539
reaction into an active
compound.

00:12:16.539 --> 00:12:22.490
So, it's another aspect of
biotransformation.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:26.799
I want to spend the next 15
or 20 minutes or so talking

00:12:26.799 --> 00:12:29.399
about how drugs are
administered.

00:12:29.399 --> 00:12:33.504
In particular,
that question should be why are

00:12:33.504 --> 00:12:36.970
they administered in different
ways?

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.618
Why is Ibuprofen taken orally,
for example,

00:12:40.618 --> 00:12:45.134
but some antibiotics or
chemotherapy drugs have to be

00:12:45.134 --> 00:12:48.870
injected directly into the
bloodstream.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.738
Why is that do you think?
Why are some drugs administered

00:12:51.738 --> 00:12:52.730
in different ways?

00:12:58.019 --> 00:12:59.847
It could be that you're
targeting different parts of the

00:12:59.847 --> 00:13:01.940
body and so you want to deliver
them at their site of action,

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.210
that might be one reason to do
it.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:09.144
There what are you changing?
You're changing the potential

00:13:09.144 --> 00:13:12.679
for side-effects really,
or the potential for toxicity

00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:16.166
of the drug.
If you can deliver more at the

00:13:16.166 --> 00:13:20.972
site of action then less of it
goes to the rest of the body

00:13:20.972 --> 00:13:24.370
where it might cause unwanted
effects,

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.150
so that's a very good reason to
target it.

00:13:32.919 --> 00:13:35.786
Student:
[inaudible]Professor Mark

00:13:35.786 --> 00:13:39.215
Saltzman: Sometimes there
are biological barriers to drugs

00:13:39.215 --> 00:13:41.519
entering different parts of the
body.

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:46.086
We're going to start by talking
about the body as sort of a

00:13:46.086 --> 00:13:50.081
single unit or compartment.
When I introduce drugs into

00:13:50.081 --> 00:13:54.139
them those drugs are available
everywhere, but that's not true.

00:13:54.139 --> 00:13:58.214
There are some parts of the
body that are protected from

00:13:58.214 --> 00:14:01.177
entry of drugs,
and the brain is the most

00:14:01.177 --> 00:14:05.399
famous of those parts of the
body that are protected.

00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:09.033
It makes sense that the brain
is protected,

00:14:09.033 --> 00:14:14.052
because the function of the
brain depends on the balance of

00:14:14.052 --> 00:14:17.340
chemical concentrations within
it,

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.616
the concentrations of ions and
neurotransmitters,

00:14:20.616 --> 00:14:24.643
and any molecules that could
potentially interfere with ions

00:14:24.643 --> 00:14:28.505
or neurotransmitters.
Our brain chemistry has to be

00:14:28.505 --> 00:14:32.889
very tightly regulated in order
for us to stay awake and pay

00:14:32.889 --> 00:14:36.679
attention and do the things that
we normally do.

00:14:36.679 --> 00:14:39.596
In contrast,
the chemistry in our blood is

00:14:39.596 --> 00:14:44.424
changing throughout the day.
After you eat chemistry changes

00:14:44.424 --> 00:14:49.169
because molecules are absorbed
from the intestine,

00:14:49.169 --> 00:14:51.850
and as those molecules get
processed by the body

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.960
concentration in the blood
changes.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.311
If your brain chemistry was
changing in that same way,

00:14:57.311 --> 00:15:00.915
then you'd be slipping in and
out of consciousness and you

00:15:00.915 --> 00:15:04.330
notice that you do a little bit
right after lunch.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.026
It's a little bit harder to pay
attention than before lunch

00:15:07.026 --> 00:15:08.700
because the chemistry is
changing,

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:13.505
but that change in chemistry is
muted by the blood brain barrier

00:15:13.505 --> 00:15:18.540
or the fact that molecules can't
get very easily into the brain.

00:15:22.019 --> 00:15:27.169
Why else might drugs be
administered in different ways?

00:15:27.169 --> 00:15:31.621
Think about insulin,
what do you know about insulin

00:15:31.621 --> 00:15:32.690
as a drug?

00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:47.135
 Student:
[inaudible]Professor Mark

00:15:47.135 --> 00:15:49.288
Saltzman: Speed of action is
an important thing and we're

00:15:49.288 --> 00:15:51.477
going to talk in a few minutes
about some drugs where onset of

00:15:51.477 --> 00:15:54.376
action is very important.
It needs to act very quickly

00:15:54.376 --> 00:15:58.076
and the way that you administer
it has as big effect on how

00:15:58.076 --> 00:16:00.820
rapidly concentrations in the
body rise.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:05.614
So, some things you need to act
very rapidly,

00:16:05.614 --> 00:16:11.279
you'll pick the mode of
administration to do that.

00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:17.615
There's another issue with
insulin which we'll come too,

00:16:17.615 --> 00:16:22.322
keep that one in mind.
This is a table that's in

00:16:22.322 --> 00:16:25.941
the book and I want to go
through it relatively quickly

00:16:25.941 --> 00:16:30.028
because I think you can read it
and it's pretty understandable

00:16:30.028 --> 00:16:32.964
on its own.
I want to use these specific

00:16:32.964 --> 00:16:36.959
examples of different routes of
administration to think about

00:16:36.959 --> 00:16:40.933
the answer to this question,'
why are drugs administered in

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:43.326
different ways?
' More importantly,

00:16:43.326 --> 00:16:47.743
to think about the biology or
the physiology of your body that

00:16:47.743 --> 00:16:51.509
leads to these alternate forms
of administration.

00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:54.628
One mode is intravenous
injection and we're going to

00:16:54.628 --> 00:16:57.350
talk --there are different kinds
of injection.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.980
You can put a needle into
different parts of the body.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:05.054
You can put it into a muscle,
you can put it under the skin,

00:17:05.054 --> 00:17:09.129
you can put it actually into
the spinal fluid that surrounds

00:17:09.129 --> 00:17:12.497
your spinal cord.
Intravenous injection refers

00:17:12.497 --> 00:17:15.785
specifically to a needle that's
placed within the

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:19.557
bloodstream--within a vein,
and so drugs are introduced

00:17:19.557 --> 00:17:23.786
directly into the bloodstream.
The advantages of that should

00:17:23.786 --> 00:17:26.660
be obvious.
That's what was related to

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.795
Caitlin's comment,
that drug is immediately

00:17:29.795 --> 00:17:33.266
introduced into the blood,
and so it's immediately

00:17:33.266 --> 00:17:36.446
distributed throughout your body
and available for action

00:17:36.446 --> 00:17:40.883
wherever it's needed.
So, onset of action is very

00:17:40.883 --> 00:17:42.997
rapid.
In addition,

00:17:42.997 --> 00:17:48.891
its bioavailability is 100%.
We've introduced the drug into

00:17:48.891 --> 00:17:53.230
the blood directly,
into your circulatory flow,

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:58.265
so all of the molecules that
are administered to the patient

00:17:58.265 --> 00:18:02.998
are available for action.
Now, usually we think about

00:18:02.998 --> 00:18:07.855
bioavailability as the fraction
of the drug that ends up in the

00:18:07.855 --> 00:18:11.545
blood and you might say,
'well but that might not be

00:18:11.545 --> 00:18:14.746
where the drug acts'.
The drug might act in the brain

00:18:14.746 --> 00:18:18.516
or it might act in the kidney,
or it might act in your muscles

00:18:18.516 --> 00:18:21.916
and being in the blood is not
the same as being in those

00:18:21.916 --> 00:18:25.529
tissues,
and you're right.

00:18:25.529 --> 00:18:29.130
It's hard to measure those
concentrations in individual

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.796
tissues and so we define
bioavailability as the fraction

00:18:32.796 --> 00:18:35.730
of a drug dose that gets into
the blood.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.938
Now, why wouldn't we do
intravenous administration for

00:18:38.938 --> 00:18:41.637
everything?
Because if it is fast,

00:18:41.637 --> 00:18:47.183
usually you don't want to wait
for--you want the drug to act as

00:18:47.183 --> 00:18:52.461
rapidly as possible and you'd
like all the drug molecules to

00:18:52.461 --> 00:18:55.449
be bioavailable,
you would like all of them to

00:18:55.449 --> 00:18:56.788
be useful.
So, why don't we use

00:18:56.788 --> 00:18:58.670
intravenous administration all
the time?

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:06.251
Well, it probably is obvious
that not--that it's not so easy

00:19:06.251 --> 00:19:08.270
to do.
That in general,

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:11.675
safe intravenous administration
requires trained medical

00:19:11.675 --> 00:19:13.886
personnel.
So, usually you're in a

00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:17.370
doctor's office or a hospital,
you don't do it yourself at

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:20.050
home.
There is a risk because you're

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:24.140
introducing drugs at high
concentration into the blood.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.376
There's much more risk of
overdose or toxicity because the

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:31.869
concentration's going to change
very rapidly.

00:19:31.869 --> 00:19:39.418
Even though you might know what
the average response to a drug

00:19:39.418 --> 00:19:44.740
is, average among a population
of people,

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:50.576
we're all different in ways
that are important to how drugs

00:19:50.576 --> 00:19:52.183
act.
You know this,

00:19:52.183 --> 00:19:55.623
if you take Ibuprofen,
you read the dosage on the

00:19:55.623 --> 00:19:59.708
label, it will say something
like 'if you're over 12 years

00:19:59.708 --> 00:20:04.008
old you take one dose and if
you're under 12 you take another

00:20:04.008 --> 00:20:06.851
dose.'
So, size of the person or age

00:20:06.851 --> 00:20:10.872
of the person is an important
determinant of how much dose you

00:20:10.872 --> 00:20:13.312
take.
Gender is often an important

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:17.136
determinant, your overall state
of health is an important

00:20:17.136 --> 00:20:21.369
determinant, and you can't know
those things for everybody.

00:20:21.369 --> 00:20:24.682
You could go on and on in this
list and so you--one individual

00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:27.940
might be more sensitive to doses
of the drug than another.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:32.204
If you're introducing all the
drug at one time intravenously

00:20:32.204 --> 00:20:35.890
the potential for an unwanted
response is higher.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:38.808
It's a risk of infection
because you're introducing

00:20:38.808 --> 00:20:41.781
something directly into the
bloodstream if it's not done

00:20:41.781 --> 00:20:43.890
properly, and it's not
comfortable.

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:48.609
Most people don't want to have
an intravenous injection.

00:20:48.609 --> 00:20:52.352
So, you might not do it in
cases where even if it would

00:20:52.352 --> 00:20:55.540
benefit you, and so those are
disadvantages.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.280
It's a very safe and effective,
and useful mode of

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.769
administration for some kinds of
compounds.

00:21:06.769 --> 00:21:08.508
For example,
for antibiotics,

00:21:08.508 --> 00:21:12.046
if you happen to have what's
called sepsis or an infection

00:21:12.046 --> 00:21:14.529
that's spread into your
bloodstream,

00:21:14.529 --> 00:21:18.531
one of the only ways to combat
those infections effectively is

00:21:18.531 --> 00:21:22.269
to introduce antibiotics
directly into the bloodstream.

00:21:22.269 --> 00:21:26.343
Intravenous infusion is a
similar mode,

00:21:26.343 --> 00:21:30.319
but now instead of a onetime
injection,

00:21:30.319 --> 00:21:34.378
with an intravenous injection
you have a syringe full of drug,

00:21:34.378 --> 00:21:36.839
a needle in the circulatory
system,

00:21:36.839 --> 00:21:40.495
and you introduce the drug all
at once, in infusion you slowly

00:21:40.495 --> 00:21:44.031
pump the drug in and you might
be pumping it in continuously

00:21:44.031 --> 00:21:49.240
over a long period time,
maybe over hours or over days.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:55.375
Sometimes this is done--you've
seen on TV shows a bag of a

00:21:55.375 --> 00:22:00.972
solution hanging up on a pole
and a tube going into a

00:22:00.972 --> 00:22:05.938
patient's arm.
So, this is an infusion where

00:22:05.938 --> 00:22:11.995
the infusion is driven by the
gravity flow of fluid through

00:22:11.995 --> 00:22:16.589
the tube into the patient's
blood vessel,

00:22:16.589 --> 00:22:19.039
that's one example of an
infusion.

00:22:19.039 --> 00:22:23.363
Other examples are there
might be pump involved at some

00:22:23.363 --> 00:22:26.396
point.
You have a pump in between the

00:22:26.396 --> 00:22:30.619
bag of fluid and the needle that
goes into the arm.

00:22:30.619 --> 00:22:34.818
In this way,
you can control the flow much

00:22:34.818 --> 00:22:36.560
more carefully.

00:22:39.759 --> 00:22:43.486
One example of where that's
done in the hospital is the

00:22:43.486 --> 00:22:46.660
molecule Heparin,
which is an anticoagulant.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:51.475
It's needed for certain
patients who are at risk of

00:22:51.475 --> 00:22:54.750
having blood clots,
for example.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:59.624
This might be--they might be at
risk for blood clots for a

00:22:59.624 --> 00:23:03.385
variety of reasons,
but you introduce the molecule

00:23:03.385 --> 00:23:07.250
Heparin which reduces the
likelihood that clots will form,

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:10.339
only you need to have a
continuous level of Heparin.

00:23:10.339 --> 00:23:15.718
You need to have that Heparin
concentration continuously at

00:23:15.718 --> 00:23:20.632
some level, and so you
continuously infuse it directly

00:23:20.632 --> 00:23:26.002
into the circulatory system.
Now, this is a very effective

00:23:26.002 --> 00:23:31.137
method for administering drugs
because you're slowly adding the

00:23:31.137 --> 00:23:36.356
drug and you're watching to see
what concentration is maintained

00:23:36.356 --> 00:23:40.407
in the person,
and you're adjusting the rate

00:23:40.407 --> 00:23:45.704
by tuning the pump until you get
exactly the concentration that

00:23:45.704 --> 00:23:49.070
you want.
You can leave it there and as

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:52.459
long as the patient stays
roughly the same,

00:23:52.459 --> 00:23:57.059
then their concentration will
remain roughly the same.

00:23:57.059 --> 00:24:00.985
So, you can expose them to a
drug over a long period of time

00:24:00.985 --> 00:24:04.645
and have a biological effect
that's constant over a long

00:24:04.645 --> 00:24:08.093
period of time.
That's very useful in certain

00:24:08.093 --> 00:24:11.180
situations like this one I've
mentioned.

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.927
Again, it's 100%
bioavailable and you have

00:24:13.927 --> 00:24:16.369
continuous control over plasma
levels.

00:24:16.369 --> 00:24:18.661
For example,
what if you knew that the

00:24:18.661 --> 00:24:22.500
patient was more at risk of
developing blood clots at night?

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.542
Well, then you'd put a
programmable pump on it,

00:24:25.542 --> 00:24:29.114
and you'd program the pump so
that the rate of infusion

00:24:29.114 --> 00:24:32.884
increased during the night and
then went down again in the

00:24:32.884 --> 00:24:35.877
morning.
In that way you could increase

00:24:35.877 --> 00:24:39.599
the concentration of drug at
night and then decrease it

00:24:39.599 --> 00:24:42.263
during the day.
So, you'd only be using the

00:24:42.263 --> 00:24:45.267
amount of drug that was needed
for a biological effect and

00:24:45.267 --> 00:24:48.113
you'd be adjusting that
biological effect for the needs

00:24:48.113 --> 00:24:50.960
of the patient in a very sort of
interactive way.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.738
You can imagine,
now, extending that very simple

00:24:54.738 --> 00:24:59.160
approach with a needle in the
bloodstream and a pump,

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:03.847
and a reservoir of fluid to
deliver any pattern of drug that

00:25:03.847 --> 00:25:09.456
was needed for that individual.
Why isn't that done all the

00:25:09.456 --> 00:25:11.790
time?
Well, for the same reasons the

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.296
intravenous infusion aren't done
all the time,

00:25:14.296 --> 00:25:16.747
plus some, because this is even
more complex,

00:25:16.747 --> 00:25:19.046
right?
So it requires continuous

00:25:19.046 --> 00:25:23.296
monitoring and so there have to
be people there in case there is

00:25:23.296 --> 00:25:27.073
some unexpected event in order
to turn off the pump or to

00:25:27.073 --> 00:25:29.873
adjust the flow.
So, that really requires

00:25:29.873 --> 00:25:33.671
hospitalization in most cases.
Now, we're going to get to the

00:25:33.671 --> 00:25:37.694
point next time where we talk
about some examples of infusion

00:25:37.694 --> 00:25:41.784
using pumps that can be worn by
individuals that can leave the

00:25:41.784 --> 00:25:45.538
hospital with these pumps either
implanted within them or

00:25:45.538 --> 00:25:48.670
strapped to their belt,
for example.

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:55.470
In general, that's done only in
unusual situations.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:58.199
Subcutaneous injection and
intramuscular injection are

00:25:58.199 --> 00:26:01.263
similar to intravenous injection
in that it's an injection from a

00:26:01.263 --> 00:26:03.335
needle.
It's a onetime introduce the

00:26:03.335 --> 00:26:05.875
drug all at once,
but you're putting the needle

00:26:05.875 --> 00:26:08.573
in a different place.
Instead of intentionally

00:26:08.573 --> 00:26:12.065
putting the needle into a vein
so that you introduce drug into

00:26:12.065 --> 00:26:16.402
the blood,
you put it either in a muscle,

00:26:16.402 --> 00:26:22.509
like a muscle mass of your arm,
or your back side.

00:26:22.509 --> 00:26:24.000
Have you ever had an injection
there?

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.789
They don't do this so commonly
anymore, I'm not sure why.

00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:31.468
I can imagine why but--into a
muscle mass and then the

00:26:31.468 --> 00:26:36.412
molecules are absorbed from that
muscle into the blood or

00:26:36.412 --> 00:26:40.886
subcutaneously--is subcutaneous,
cutaneous is skin,

00:26:40.886 --> 00:26:43.983
sub is under,
this is an injection under the

00:26:43.983 --> 00:26:46.209
skin.
So, you could pull up on your

00:26:46.209 --> 00:26:48.882
skin a little flap,
you can sort of pull it away

00:26:48.882 --> 00:26:52.181
from the muscle and you'd insert
the needle under there and

00:26:52.181 --> 00:26:55.537
introduce a little reservoir of
drug solution underneath the

00:26:55.537 --> 00:26:59.137
skin.
Now, this is how diabetics

00:26:59.137 --> 00:27:03.319
administer insulin to
themselves, usually.

00:27:03.319 --> 00:27:09.352
They put a needle into the
muscle and they inject a volume

00:27:09.352 --> 00:27:15.490
of an insulin-containing
solution into the muscle space.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:20.278
I say on this sheet here that
bioavailability in that case is

00:27:20.278 --> 00:27:23.470
usually high,
why is it--who do you think

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:27.860
bioavailability is high for
these particular modes?

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:34.539
Why is it high for
intramuscular injection?

00:27:34.539 --> 00:27:39.282
It might be 80% or 90%,
so it's not 100% but it's

00:27:39.282 --> 00:27:41.950
pretty high, why is that?

00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:51.304
How does the drug get into the
blood from there if I inject it

00:27:51.304 --> 00:27:52.340
into muscle?

00:28:00.289 --> 00:28:03.112
Justin?Student:
[inaudible]Professor Mark

00:28:03.112 --> 00:28:05.156
Saltzman: Yeah,
so your muscle is being

00:28:05.156 --> 00:28:07.987
perfused by blood all the time.
It gets blood flow,

00:28:07.987 --> 00:28:10.657
there's arteries going in,
capillary networks,

00:28:10.657 --> 00:28:14.038
and veins that are collecting
blood so there's a very rich

00:28:14.038 --> 00:28:17.501
blood supply in muscle.
So, you inject it into the

00:28:17.501 --> 00:28:21.311
muscle tissue and the drug just
sort of percolates in or

00:28:21.311 --> 00:28:25.329
diffuses into the blood vessels
that are already there.

00:28:25.329 --> 00:28:28.679
Now, the effects tend to last
longer than an intravenous

00:28:28.679 --> 00:28:32.454
administration because it takes
some time for the drugs to move

00:28:32.454 --> 00:28:35.559
from this reservoir where you've
injected them,

00:28:35.559 --> 00:28:38.631
this little depot in the
muscle, it takes some time for

00:28:38.631 --> 00:28:41.019
the drugs to move into your
bloodstream.

00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:46.109
So, you get a prolonged effect
because of that;

00:28:46.109 --> 00:28:48.529
not all the drug is available
at once.

00:28:48.529 --> 00:28:51.978
You also don't get all the
drug in because some of it is

00:28:51.978 --> 00:28:54.901
metabolized locally or it
doesn't go into the blood

00:28:54.901 --> 00:28:58.000
vessels at all and so it doesn't
get distributed.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.849
So, bioavailabilities not 100%
but it's often pretty high.

00:29:01.849 --> 00:29:07.589
It's not as hazardous because
you're not actually introducing

00:29:07.589 --> 00:29:12.503
a needle into a vein.
It can be done by individuals

00:29:12.503 --> 00:29:16.059
at home and so diabetics can do
this;

00:29:16.059 --> 00:29:18.860
they can do it several times a
day.

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:25.520
It's still uncomfortable,
most people don't want to do it

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.180
and you wouldn't do it if there
was an alternative.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:31.340
Why is there no alternative for
insulin?

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:37.968
Why do diabetics do it this way?
Why do they inject insulin in

00:29:37.968 --> 00:29:40.243
this way?
I think most of you can

00:29:40.243 --> 00:29:43.397
understand that they would
prefer not to,

00:29:43.397 --> 00:29:47.387
what would they prefer to do?
If you were a diabetic patient

00:29:47.387 --> 00:29:49.930
and you needed insulin what
would you prefer to do?

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:51.772
Kate?Student:
Orally.Professor Mark

00:29:51.772 --> 00:29:53.579
Saltzman: You'd prefer to
take a pill, right?

00:29:53.579 --> 00:29:58.296
You prefer to take a pill and
that's the next one on the list,

00:29:58.296 --> 00:30:01.733
is oral administration.
You prefer to take a pill but

00:30:01.733 --> 00:30:04.480
you can't with insulin because
insulin is a protein.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:11.020
Insulin is a protein that is
digested in the intestinal

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.446
tract.
That's one of the functions of

00:30:14.446 --> 00:30:19.194
our gut, is to digest foods that
we eat, foods that contain

00:30:19.194 --> 00:30:23.480
proteins for example.
So, your intestinal system is

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:28.440
very efficient at breaking down
proteins into their constituent

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.491
amino acids,
and it does that so that you

00:30:31.491 --> 00:30:35.128
can extract amino acids from
food and use them for other

00:30:35.128 --> 00:30:38.225
things.
If a protein is a drug,

00:30:38.225 --> 00:30:43.278
you need it to enter the
bloodstream without being broken

00:30:43.278 --> 00:30:45.155
down.
When it's broken down it

00:30:45.155 --> 00:30:46.890
doesn't have the effect any
longer.

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:52.431
So, insulin can't be delivered
orally, primarily because it's

00:30:52.431 --> 00:30:57.789
digested within the stomach and
small intestine before it's

00:30:57.789 --> 00:31:02.099
absorbed.
Another problem with developing

00:31:02.099 --> 00:31:08.016
a pill or oral forms of insulin
is that large molecules like

00:31:08.016 --> 00:31:10.561
insulin,
which is a protein,

00:31:10.561 --> 00:31:14.886
has a molecule weight of about
5,000 are not absorbed very

00:31:14.886 --> 00:31:17.769
easily through the intestinal
wall.

00:31:17.769 --> 00:31:21.502
We talked about this several
weeks ago, your intestinal wall

00:31:21.502 --> 00:31:25.044
is a--it's a tube that the
surface of the tube is made up

00:31:25.044 --> 00:31:28.333
of a continuous sheet or
monolayer of cells and these

00:31:28.333 --> 00:31:31.180
cells are connected by tight
junctions.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:34.049
Remember that picture I showed
you several weeks ago?

00:31:34.049 --> 00:31:37.970
Because of that for a molecule
to enter it has to be able to go

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:42.150
through that monolayer of cells.
Even if insulin wasn't broken

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:45.440
down to its constituent
molecules it couldn't be

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.220
absorbed very easily because
it's a large molecule.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:54.034
Only molecules that are small
and relatively lipid soluble can

00:31:54.034 --> 00:31:58.454
go through monolayers of cells
like the epithelium of the

00:31:58.454 --> 00:32:03.214
intestine.
There's two reasons why insulin

00:32:03.214 --> 00:32:08.990
is not very bioavailable when
it's given orally.

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:12.203
That's one way of saying
insulin doesn't end up in the

00:32:12.203 --> 00:32:15.113
blood, insulin is not
bioavailable when delivered

00:32:15.113 --> 00:32:17.753
orally.
Some drugs are aspirin,

00:32:17.753 --> 00:32:20.677
acetaminophen,
Ibuprofen, things that you

00:32:20.677 --> 00:32:25.282
might take routinely for muscle
aches or headaches are available

00:32:25.282 --> 00:32:28.316
orally.
They're small molecules,

00:32:28.316 --> 00:32:32.808
they aren't digested
appreciably or only a fraction

00:32:32.808 --> 00:32:38.109
of them are digested so that if
you take ten milligrams,

00:32:38.109 --> 00:32:44.760
maybe five milligrams of them
are not broken down in the gut

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.705
and can be absorbed.
One of the problems with oral

00:32:48.705 --> 00:32:51.940
administration is that drugs are
degraded before they're absorbed

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:54.500
into the body.
Now, we could tolerate that

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:57.019
with aspirin,
and why do you think that's

00:32:57.019 --> 00:33:00.924
acceptable with aspirin to have
some fraction of it broken down

00:33:00.924 --> 00:33:04.830
in the body--broken down in the
gut before it's absorbed?

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:06.010
Why is that acceptable?

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:17.183
How much does aspirin cost?
Student:

00:33:17.183 --> 00:33:19.248
[inaudible]Professor Mark
Saltzman: Not very much,

00:33:19.248 --> 00:33:21.279
you don't think about it when
you go buy a couple of tablets

00:33:21.279 --> 00:33:23.493
of aspirin,
you go buy a bottle of aspirin

00:33:23.493 --> 00:33:26.876
or Ibuprofen because it costs
something but it doesn't cost so

00:33:26.876 --> 00:33:29.412
much.
So, if you had to pay two times

00:33:29.412 --> 00:33:33.394
as much because you lost half of
it, because it was degraded

00:33:33.394 --> 00:33:36.500
before it got absorbed,
that might be okay.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:40.212
You're more likely to use it
because it's a pill and not an

00:33:40.212 --> 00:33:44.309
injection and you're willing to
pay more for that convenience.

00:33:44.309 --> 00:33:47.498
Often, drugs that are orally
administered,

00:33:47.498 --> 00:33:52.243
they're not 100% bioavailable,
only a fraction of it gets into

00:33:52.243 --> 00:33:55.320
your blood,
but they're molecules that can

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:59.331
be produced cheaply enough that
you can still take a dose that's

00:33:59.331 --> 00:34:03.424
larger than what you would need,
knowing that half of it is not

00:34:03.424 --> 00:34:08.050
going to enter your body.
Does that make sense?

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:13.384
The other thing about
aspirin is that it's not--I'll

00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:18.467
use aspirin as an example,
realizing that nobody uses

00:34:18.467 --> 00:34:24.021
aspirin for headaches anymore,
but it's a good example because

00:34:24.021 --> 00:34:27.300
it's a molecule that's very
safe.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:32.031
A safe drug is one in which the
concentration at which it causes

00:34:32.031 --> 00:34:36.462
toxic effects is much higher
than the concentration at which

00:34:36.462 --> 00:34:41.909
it causes good effects,
or the effect that you want.

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:45.830
We know in aspirin that if you
get your concentration up to a

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:48.639
certain level your headache will
go away.

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:51.897
You'd have to get a much higher
level in your blood before you

00:34:51.897 --> 00:34:54.460
began to see side effects or
unwanted effects.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:59.890
In aspirin those side effects
are that your ears start to ring

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:05.409
because it starts to effect
the--your mechanisms of hearing,

00:35:05.409 --> 00:35:08.238
the cells within your cochlear
start to be affected by

00:35:08.238 --> 00:35:10.800
concentrations of the drug at a
certain level.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.610
You have to take a lot in
order to get up there.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:20.696
This difference between an
effective dose and a toxic dose

00:35:20.696 --> 00:35:25.462
is very important for drugs.
Drugs that have a big

00:35:25.462 --> 00:35:30.151
difference between the safe dose
and the effective dose are ones

00:35:30.151 --> 00:35:34.840
that you can give to patients
and trust them to take safely.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:38.112
You could imagine if the toxic
dose was very close to the

00:35:38.112 --> 00:35:41.677
effective dose that might not be
a drug that you would want to

00:35:41.677 --> 00:35:45.067
have patients administering
themselves because what if they

00:35:45.067 --> 00:35:47.579
accidentally take one too many
pills,

00:35:47.579 --> 00:35:52.045
or they take them too close
together, they could produce

00:35:52.045 --> 00:35:56.146
toxic side effects.
Aspirin is an example where you

00:35:56.146 --> 00:35:59.780
have a big window between
effective and toxic.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:04.389
Chemotherapy drugs are drugs
where there's a very narrow

00:36:04.389 --> 00:36:09.251
window between effective and
toxic and so those are usually

00:36:09.251 --> 00:36:13.610
given with the help and guidance
of a physician.

00:36:17.909 --> 00:36:22.313
There's a similar mode of
administration called sublingual

00:36:22.313 --> 00:36:24.700
or buckle.
Here, the drug is not

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:29.045
swallowed, it's taken in the
mouth but it's--but you hold the

00:36:29.045 --> 00:36:33.461
pill or the capsule underneath
your tongue and you allow it to

00:36:33.461 --> 00:36:37.258
dissolve there.
So, the drug enters your body

00:36:37.258 --> 00:36:41.873
because it's absorbed through
the membranes in your mouth,

00:36:41.873 --> 00:36:45.760
particularly the membranes
under your tongue.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.098
This is a common mode of
administration for

00:36:48.098 --> 00:36:50.924
nitroglycerin.
If you have grandparents or

00:36:50.924 --> 00:36:55.222
friends who are older that have
certain kind of heart disease

00:36:55.222 --> 00:36:59.215
where they get chest pain,
they might carry with them

00:36:59.215 --> 00:37:02.901
tablets of nitroglycerin.
If they begin to experience

00:37:02.901 --> 00:37:06.836
pain they'll put one of these
tablets underneath their tongue

00:37:06.836 --> 00:37:10.782
and they'll let it dissolve.
There's a number of reasons

00:37:10.782 --> 00:37:14.204
for doing this.
The most important one is that

00:37:14.204 --> 00:37:18.748
when you're taking a drug
orally, you're taking advantage

00:37:18.748 --> 00:37:23.292
of the mechanisms that your body
has for getting food and

00:37:23.292 --> 00:37:26.581
nutrients,
and you're using those

00:37:26.581 --> 00:37:31.176
mechanisms to get a drug.
When molecules are absorbed

00:37:31.176 --> 00:37:35.391
through your intestine,
they go through the intestinal

00:37:35.391 --> 00:37:40.559
wall, they enter the bloodstream
that surrounds the intestine.

00:37:40.559 --> 00:37:45.496
Then, the way that your anatomy
is set up all of the blood flow

00:37:45.496 --> 00:37:49.875
from your intestine goes
directly to your liver and from

00:37:49.875 --> 00:37:55.369
your liver it goes back into the
vena cava and then to the heart.

00:37:55.369 --> 00:37:58.938
Now, why would you design a
system like that,

00:37:58.938 --> 00:38:03.562
where all the blood from your
intestine goes right to your

00:38:03.562 --> 00:38:06.008
liver first?
Justin?Student:

00:38:06.008 --> 00:38:08.613
[inaudible]Professor Mark
Saltzman: Purifying and

00:38:08.613 --> 00:38:11.130
processing of the stuff that
comes from the intestine,

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:14.203
stuff like food,
nutrients that are extracted

00:38:14.203 --> 00:38:17.067
from food, sugars,
fats, proteins that are

00:38:17.067 --> 00:38:20.280
extracted from food that go to
your liver.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.171
Why do they go to your liver?
Because your liver is a very

00:38:23.171 --> 00:38:27.178
important metabolic organ and it
is important for processing

00:38:27.178 --> 00:38:29.420
proteins and fats,
and sugars.

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.429
So, by sending all those
molecules that are absorbed from

00:38:32.429 --> 00:38:34.309
the intestine to the liver
first,

00:38:34.309 --> 00:38:38.587
you get a jump start on
processing of these molecules

00:38:38.587 --> 00:38:42.289
into the substrates that you
need for life.

00:38:42.289 --> 00:38:47.234
That's a really good set up for
nutrition, but I also mentioned,

00:38:47.234 --> 00:38:51.786
remember that biotransformation
or breakdown of drugs often

00:38:51.786 --> 00:38:55.578
occurs in the liver.
So, if drugs are absorbed the

00:38:55.578 --> 00:38:58.869
same way that food is they go
right to the liver,

00:38:58.869 --> 00:39:01.683
and--I'm pointing here because
that's where my liver is,

00:39:01.683 --> 00:39:04.702
they go right to the liver and
your liver starts to break it

00:39:04.702 --> 00:39:08.130
down right away before it even
gets to your bloodstream really,

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:11.010
before it circulates to the
rest of your body.

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:14.449
I lose a fraction of drug
because it's degraded within the

00:39:14.449 --> 00:39:18.190
gut, I lose a fraction because
it can't absorb very rapidly,

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:21.882
and I lose another fraction
because the liver breaks it down

00:39:21.882 --> 00:39:25.575
before it ever gets back to my
heart and then your heart can

00:39:25.575 --> 00:39:28.685
circulate it.
Well, it turns out that the

00:39:28.685 --> 00:39:32.512
blood supply to the membranes in
your mouth don't go to the

00:39:32.512 --> 00:39:35.918
liver, it's unusual.
They go directly into the

00:39:35.918 --> 00:39:38.940
superior vena cava and into your
heart.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:43.171
So, drug molecules that are
absorbed in your mouth bypass

00:39:43.171 --> 00:39:47.704
the liver and they go directly
to your--the rest of your body

00:39:47.704 --> 00:39:50.139
first.
Then of course they're going to

00:39:50.139 --> 00:39:53.010
end up in the liver as things
get circulated around.

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:57.232
They avoid going to the liver
the first time and that's

00:39:57.232 --> 00:40:01.690
called, here on this graph,
avoiding first-pass metabolism

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:04.939
in the liver.
This metabolism that occurs on

00:40:04.939 --> 00:40:08.714
the first shot right from the
intestine is called first-pass

00:40:08.714 --> 00:40:11.730
metabolism.
Nitroglycerin would be very

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:14.400
readily broken down in the
liver.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.685
So this way it goes directly to
the heart without ever having to

00:40:18.685 --> 00:40:23.039
pass through the liver and it
can quickly treat heart disease.

00:40:23.039 --> 00:40:25.710
Now, why don't you do that
with all sorts of things?

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:28.818
Well, it only works for certain
kinds of compounds,

00:40:28.818 --> 00:40:32.611
compounds that can be absorbed
through those membranes in your

00:40:32.611 --> 00:40:35.409
mouth so they have to very lipid
soluble.

00:40:35.409 --> 00:40:38.416
They also have to be very
potent because one difference

00:40:38.416 --> 00:40:41.478
between your mouth and the
intestine is that the surface

00:40:41.478 --> 00:40:43.650
area in your mouth is fairly
small.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.627
Only a limited number of drugs
can absorb through,

00:40:50.627 --> 00:40:53.829
whereas--why is your intestine
so long?

00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:56.968
You know that your
intestinal--you took it out and

00:40:56.968 --> 00:41:00.428
stretched it out it would be a
tube, a continuous tube,

00:41:00.428 --> 00:41:03.901
that's about 30 feet long.
Why is your intestine that

00:41:03.901 --> 00:41:06.050
long, packed into this small
space?

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:10.415
So that it can have a big
surface area to absorb lots of

00:41:10.415 --> 00:41:13.503
stuff;
big surface area--lots of

00:41:13.503 --> 00:41:18.510
absorption, small surface
area--little absorption.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:22.744
It has to be a very potent drug
in order to be absorbed at a

00:41:22.744 --> 00:41:26.619
sufficient concentration through
this limited space.

00:41:26.619 --> 00:41:29.279
I think those are the main
concepts that I wanted to

00:41:29.279 --> 00:41:31.841
introduce by thinking about
these different methods of

00:41:31.841 --> 00:41:34.386
administration.
There's more of them listed

00:41:34.386 --> 00:41:37.940
here, some of them have to do
with what Caitlin mentioned.

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:41.497
If you want a drug that works
in the eye, for example,

00:41:41.497 --> 00:41:45.551
a drug to treat glaucoma,
why take a drug orally and

00:41:45.551 --> 00:41:50.464
expose your whole body to the
drug when you could just put

00:41:50.464 --> 00:41:54.730
drops in your eye directly?
And that's how many glaucoma

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:58.160
drugs are delivered?
You might have eye drops that

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.678
you just put into the space
underneath your eye,

00:42:01.678 --> 00:42:04.522
for example,
and that's a more targeted

00:42:04.522 --> 00:42:06.809
delivery.
Targeted because you are

00:42:06.809 --> 00:42:09.289
putting the drug at the site
where it's needed.

00:42:09.289 --> 00:42:11.510
I'm sure you have examples of
that;

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:15.041
topical ointments like
antibacterial cream you might

00:42:15.041 --> 00:42:19.334
put on something if you have a
cut and you want to keep it from

00:42:19.334 --> 00:42:22.439
being infected.
You don't take antibiotics by

00:42:22.439 --> 00:42:25.832
mouth and have them all over
your body, you put a little

00:42:25.832 --> 00:42:29.348
topical treatment on the site
because you're targeting the

00:42:29.348 --> 00:42:31.570
drug to the site that you need.

00:42:35.659 --> 00:42:40.277
On the next slide there's
some other more uncommon modes

00:42:40.277 --> 00:42:43.250
of administration,
rectal, transdermal,

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:46.602
vaginal.
We won't talk very much about

00:42:46.602 --> 00:42:51.426
those, and next week we'll talk
about special kinds of drug

00:42:51.426 --> 00:42:55.751
delivery systems that are useful
for certain kinds of

00:42:55.751 --> 00:43:00.159
administration like what are
called controlled release

00:43:00.159 --> 00:43:04.159
implants,
we'll talk about next time.

00:43:04.159 --> 00:43:07.274
I want--I've given you a lot of
words and I've tried to

00:43:07.274 --> 00:43:10.734
introduce a lot of concepts by
thinking about things that you

00:43:10.734 --> 00:43:13.338
know about.
I want to try to put this in

00:43:13.338 --> 00:43:17.002
some framework that allows you
to think about quantitatively

00:43:17.002 --> 00:43:19.610
what it means--what these
factors mean.

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:23.445
We're going to introduce drugs
into a patient and what we would

00:43:23.445 --> 00:43:27.280
like to know is how rapidly do
those drugs become available,

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.570
what fraction of the drugs
become available,

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:34.090
and how long does the one dose
we give last?

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:37.039
As I mentioned,
that's complicated,

00:43:37.039 --> 00:43:41.289
complicated because our anatomy
is complicated,

00:43:41.289 --> 00:43:44.403
and complicated because we're
all different individuals and

00:43:44.403 --> 00:43:46.389
our anatomy and physiology
differs.

00:43:46.389 --> 00:43:50.217
So, it's a hard thing to,
do to describe how even one

00:43:50.217 --> 00:43:54.339
particular kind of drug acts in
a population of people is

00:43:54.339 --> 00:43:56.788
difficult.
We have to start somewhere

00:43:56.788 --> 00:43:59.010
so we're going to start with a
simplification.

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:03.301
That simplification is that
these complex

00:44:03.301 --> 00:44:08.450
things--people--can be
represented by very simple

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:11.938
constructs.
The simple construct that I

00:44:11.938 --> 00:44:16.111
show here is that instead of a
person we're going to consider

00:44:16.111 --> 00:44:19.520
the person to be a well stirred
vat of liquid,

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:24.923
water for example.
Now, how can you get away with

00:44:24.923 --> 00:44:27.339
that?
Well, one to say you can get

00:44:27.339 --> 00:44:30.024
away with it is that we are
mostly water,

00:44:30.024 --> 00:44:33.985
our bodies are 90% water and so
if you wanted to describe us

00:44:33.985 --> 00:44:37.610
sort of in the simplest possible
way we're water,

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:40.696
that's largely what we are.
We're structured water with a

00:44:40.696 --> 00:44:44.619
particular kind of shape and
form, but we're largely water.

00:44:44.619 --> 00:44:47.958
We could describe where
drugs go in the body by just

00:44:47.958 --> 00:44:50.630
thinking about how they dissolve
in water.

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:53.715
All you'd need to know is,
'What's the volume of the

00:44:53.715 --> 00:44:55.503
water?'
So, if I give a dose what

00:44:55.503 --> 00:44:57.940
concentration do you get,
I give ten milligrams.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:01.752
If your volume is five liters,
what's the concentration you

00:45:01.752 --> 00:45:04.130
achieve inside?
What did I say?

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:07.511
Ten milligrams?
I forgot what number I said

00:45:07.511 --> 00:45:10.882
now, ten milligrams divided by
five liters, two milligrams per

00:45:10.882 --> 00:45:14.154
liter.
That's the concentration and

00:45:14.154 --> 00:45:17.920
that's the simplest way to
define it.

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.280
Now, how can I get away with
saying that we're well-stirred?

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.710
I indicate that in this simple
drawing by having a--this is a

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:26.340
propeller that's stirring the
vat of liquid,

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.000
how can I get away with saying
we're well-stirred?

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.969
Well, in some senses we are,
that's what our circulatory

00:45:32.969 --> 00:45:37.300
system does, and I'm going to
talk about that in the weeks to

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:39.681
come,
but our heart is a very

00:45:39.681 --> 00:45:43.595
effective--our heart and our
blood vessels are a very

00:45:43.595 --> 00:45:47.132
effective system for
distributing molecules very

00:45:47.132 --> 00:45:51.498
rapidly throughout a large
volume and so we are stirred--we

00:45:51.498 --> 00:45:54.659
are well-stirred in certain
senses.

00:45:54.659 --> 00:45:57.206
Now, you could object to
this simple model for lots of

00:45:57.206 --> 00:45:59.752
different reasons but we're
going to start with it because

00:45:59.752 --> 00:46:01.449
it's a very simple place to
start.

00:46:01.449 --> 00:46:05.349
We're going to say then when we
administer a drug we're

00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:09.538
introducing a drug into this
well stirred vat of water that

00:46:09.538 --> 00:46:13.034
has a particular volume.
We're going to administer some

00:46:13.034 --> 00:46:15.590
dose and we're going to produce
some concentration.

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:20.420
Now, what happens afterwards?
Does that concentration stay

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:23.879
the same forever?
No, it doesn't because we--our

00:46:23.879 --> 00:46:26.699
body has mechanisms for getting
rid of drugs.

00:46:26.699 --> 00:46:31.625
We're going to describe that in
our simple model by having an

00:46:31.625 --> 00:46:36.304
arrow pointing out that tells
you how--that tells you that

00:46:36.304 --> 00:46:40.820
drugs are eliminated when
they're within your body.

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:45.267
We're going to make this a
very simple process also and say

00:46:45.267 --> 00:46:48.638
that drugs are eliminated in
proportion to their

00:46:48.638 --> 00:46:49.930
concentration.

00:46:53.139 --> 00:46:56.983
The more drug you have the
faster it gets eliminated,

00:46:56.983 --> 00:47:01.196
and as you have less and less
drug it gets eliminated more

00:47:01.196 --> 00:47:06.164
slowly.
Now, this--the simplest way to

00:47:06.164 --> 00:47:14.889
describe this is to say that the
rate of disappearance of a drug

00:47:14.889 --> 00:47:22.230
is equal to some constant times
the concentration.

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:25.348
The rate of disappearance of a
drug is equal to some constant

00:47:25.348 --> 00:47:29.525
times the concentration.
This constant is called a rate

00:47:29.525 --> 00:47:34.330
constant and this is the
concentration that would be

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:40.429
within the body.
This is a first-order equation.

00:47:40.429 --> 00:47:44.442
Means that the rate at which
the drug is eliminated is

00:47:44.442 --> 00:47:49.137
proportional to concentration to
the first-power or linear with

00:47:49.137 --> 00:47:52.649
concentration.
As drug concentration goes

00:47:52.649 --> 00:47:56.948
down, since k is a
constant for any particular

00:47:56.948 --> 00:47:58.809
drug.
It's one number,

00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:03.456
as the concentration drops from
two milligrams per liter to one

00:48:03.456 --> 00:48:06.912
milligram per liter,
the rate that your body

00:48:06.912 --> 00:48:10.000
eliminates it goes down by half
as well.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.992
I like to think about this
as you could think about

00:48:13.992 --> 00:48:16.949
concentration as money in your
wallet,

00:48:16.949 --> 00:48:20.531
and the rate at which I spend
money anyway is proportional to

00:48:20.531 --> 00:48:22.800
the amount that I have in my
wallet;

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:26.429
when I have more I spend more,
when I have less I spend less,

00:48:26.429 --> 00:48:28.909
and the last dollar goes really
slowly.

00:48:28.909 --> 00:48:32.305
The same thing here,
when you have a lot of

00:48:32.305 --> 00:48:36.832
concentration your body gets rid
of it fast, but the last

00:48:36.832 --> 00:48:41.763
molecules go out very slowly.
If we take this simple model

00:48:41.763 --> 00:48:45.078
and then apply it,
and we introduce a dose

00:48:45.078 --> 00:48:48.777
directly into the body,
now this well-stirred vat,

00:48:48.777 --> 00:48:52.281
and we say that it has some
volume and we say that drug is

00:48:52.281 --> 00:48:55.170
eliminated with some rate
constant k,

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:57.400
we could derive a simple
equation.

00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.905
This is derived in the book,
in the box at the back of the

00:49:00.905 --> 00:49:04.656
chapter, that would tell us how
concentration varies with time

00:49:04.656 --> 00:49:08.976
and that equation is shown here.
The concentration is equal to

00:49:08.976 --> 00:49:13.553
the dose that I introduced which
is M_0 divided

00:49:13.553 --> 00:49:17.099
by the volume of the body,
times e^(-kt),

00:49:17.099 --> 00:49:20.937
where k is this rate
constant for disappearance of

00:49:20.937 --> 00:49:22.708
the drug;
C = (M_0/V)*

00:49:22.708 --> 00:49:23.886
e^(-kt).
Now, if you don't

00:49:23.886 --> 00:49:25.882
understand when you look at the
book where this equation comes

00:49:25.882 --> 00:49:27.570
from,
that's not important.

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:32.385
Some of you will and some of
you won't, but you could trust

00:49:32.385 --> 00:49:37.201
me that this is the equation
that results from those simple

00:49:37.201 --> 00:49:42.038
assumptions that I talked about.
C is the concentration

00:49:42.038 --> 00:49:45.417
that's available in your
bloodstream or in this vat of

00:49:45.417 --> 00:49:47.840
fluid, that's available for
action.

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:51.063
M_0 is the
amount that's introduced,

00:49:51.063 --> 00:49:53.853
and remember I introduced it in
a special way,

00:49:53.853 --> 00:49:56.210
I injected it right into the
body.

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:59.895
I injected it all into the
body, the whole dose at time

00:49:59.895 --> 00:50:02.808
t equals 0.
I introduced it all into the

00:50:02.808 --> 00:50:05.630
body at once so it was all
available to circulate.

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:09.389
That assumes the
bioavailability is 100% and that

00:50:09.389 --> 00:50:13.150
I've introduced it all at one
particular time.

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:16.300
What is this really a
representation of?

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:20.449
It's a representation of
intravenous injection where I

00:50:20.449 --> 00:50:24.519
have syringe and I inject all of
the drug at once.

00:50:24.519 --> 00:50:27.590
In that case,
what this equation tells you is

00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:31.044
that the concentration
immediately after you inject the

00:50:31.044 --> 00:50:34.776
drug is the highest,
and after that it continually

00:50:34.776 --> 00:50:38.742
goes down.
It goes down in an exponential

00:50:38.742 --> 00:50:44.486
fashion with a time course that
depends on this constant

00:50:44.486 --> 00:50:48.239
k.
Does that make sense?

00:50:48.239 --> 00:50:51.398
If I have intravenous
administration of a drug that's

00:50:51.398 --> 00:50:54.983
eliminated by a first-order
process, as soon as I administer

00:50:54.983 --> 00:50:59.789
it, the concentration is a peak.
After that it goes down and the

00:50:59.789 --> 00:51:04.436
rate at which it goes down
depends on this rate constant

00:51:04.436 --> 00:51:07.049
k.
What I also show you here is

00:51:07.049 --> 00:51:10.420
that if I plugged into this
equation I asked the question,

00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:13.707
'When does the concentration go
down by a factor of two,

00:51:13.707 --> 00:51:17.923
when does it go down by 50%?'
I would look on this graph here

00:51:17.923 --> 00:51:21.429
and say 50% of the drug is gone
by this time.

00:51:21.429 --> 00:51:25.395
I could calculate that time at
which the drug concentration

00:51:25.395 --> 00:51:29.429
goes down by half and that's
equal to the ln(2/k),

00:51:29.429 --> 00:51:35.295
this rate constant here,
so when this number is smaller

00:51:35.295 --> 00:51:39.788
the half life is longer.
Molecules with a high

00:51:39.788 --> 00:51:43.757
k are eliminated rapidly;
molecules with a low k

00:51:43.757 --> 00:51:46.854
are eliminated slowly.
That half-life is a good

00:51:46.854 --> 00:51:50.949
measure of how long the drug
activity lasts in your body;

00:51:50.949 --> 00:51:55.817
it's a good way of thinking
about how long I'd have to wait

00:51:55.817 --> 00:51:59.510
before I needed another dose,
for example.

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:02.352
What this graph shows you here
is just plotted on a semi-log

00:52:02.352 --> 00:52:04.641
plot.
The difference between these

00:52:04.641 --> 00:52:07.847
curbs, if I had drugs with
different half-life,

00:52:07.847 --> 00:52:11.960
a drug with a half-life of 600
minutes last a long time;

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:14.895
concentration doesn't drop
until a long time,

00:52:14.895 --> 00:52:16.630
it has many,
many hours.

00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:21.422
If it has a half-life of 60
minutes, concentration drops to

00:52:21.422 --> 00:52:25.139
10% of its initial level after a
few hours.

00:52:25.139 --> 00:52:28.645
If I have a drug with the
half-life of six minutes

00:52:28.645 --> 00:52:32.865
concentration drops to 10% of
its initial level after only a

00:52:32.865 --> 00:52:35.601
few minutes.
So, we're going to take this

00:52:35.601 --> 00:52:39.012
model and extend it next time
and talk about more complicated

00:52:39.012 --> 00:52:42.594
modes of administration and talk
about sort of new forms of drug

00:52:42.594 --> 00:52:46.007
delivery,
forms that you can expect to

00:52:46.007 --> 00:52:47.807
see in the next few years.

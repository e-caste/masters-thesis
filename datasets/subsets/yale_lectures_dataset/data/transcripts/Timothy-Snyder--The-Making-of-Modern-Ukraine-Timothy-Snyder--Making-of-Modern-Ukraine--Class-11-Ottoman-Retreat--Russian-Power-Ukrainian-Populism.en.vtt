00:00:00.413 --> 00:00:03.163
(dramatic music)

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.160
- Okay, everyone,
greetings, happy Tuesday.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.983
Thursday is the exam.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.010
There's not, you know,
what is there to say?

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.363
Think about what you would
ask on the essay question.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.300
Also, think about the year
1699 and what it means to you.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.540
It's a very easy year to remember, 1699.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.550
Lots of things happen in 1699.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.157
We're gonna cover some of them today.

00:00:44.157 --> 00:00:47.340
The thing that we're trying to do today

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.130
is difficult for a couple of reasons.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.050
The first is that the 18th
century is just tricky.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.610
I don't know how often you guys

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.700
think about the 18th
century, but the 18th century

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.370
is somewhere before we
get into the comfortable,

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.160
modern categories of mass politics.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.100
But it's also somewhere
after we're in the things

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.800
we think we understand, like
Middle Ages and Renaissance

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.180
and reformation.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.790
The 18th century is very tricky,

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.370
but it's also fascinating to historians

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.170
who I admire very much, the late Tony Judt

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.510
and my colleague here, Paul Yushkovich.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.610
Both, you know, have always insisted to me

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.890
that the 18th century is the best century.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.180
And I'm working on that.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.310
I'm working to try to make
the 18th century good,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.773
and hopefully I can make it accessible.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.000
The other reason that
this is tricky is that

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.800
if we're gonna understand
what happened to Ukrainians

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.310
in the 18th century, even
more than other times,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.290
we're gonna have to
keep geography straight.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.910
And this is why I've handed out,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.740
in addition to the the term sheets,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.170
I've handed out the two maps

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.300
because the thing that
we have to understand

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.830
in the 18th century is how Russian power

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.030
ends up dominating the
zone from the Baltic Sea

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.640
to the Black Sea, which is new.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.950
Up until now that zone
between the Baltic Sea

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.860
and the Black Sea has had
all kinds of powers in it,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.320
but it hasn't been the Russian Empire.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.560
In the 18th century, beginning from 1699,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.920
or beginning from 1700,
we see a turn of events,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.130
which leads to Russia, the Russian Empire

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.290
dominating that zone.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.750
By the end of the 18th century, you know,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.240
if you're not gonna pay attention
for the next 54 minutes,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.320
this is where it's gonna go.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.300
By the end of the 18th century,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.710
the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.180
is gonna be outta the picture.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.710
The Ukrainian Cossack states

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.240
are gonna have lost all their autonomy

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.310
and basically be working for Russia.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.320
And the Crimean Khanate,

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.460
which we're gonna be talking about today,

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.620
is going to cease to exist.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.180
So three major entities,

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.820
which have been around for
centuries in one form or another,

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.070
are going to be dominated or dismissed

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.190
by the end of the 18th century.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.480
If this were a class
about the Russian Empire,

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.700
you know, this would be
about the spread of Russia,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.170
and of course we'll be talking about that.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.700
But from our point of view,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.920
what we need to have in focus is

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.320
the kind of simultaneous weakening

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.990
and disappearance of these three entities.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.110
Because as these three entities disappear,

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.720
they don't do so gracefully.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.240
They do so in conflict with one another.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.920
And that's one of the reasons, of course,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.880
why they do disappear, is the
conflict with one another.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.650
The other reason, which you can just have

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.400
in the back of your mind
is that it is Russia,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.660
the Russian Empire,

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.320
which breaks out into the
European age of discovery, right?

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.450
Not the Crimeans, not the Poles,

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.550
not the Ukrainians, but it's Russia

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.740
which breaks out into the
European age of discovery,

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.940
which becomes an empire

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.710
in the fully global sense of the word,

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.660
in having access to the Pacific Ocean

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.770
and having access to the
Atlantic by way of the Baltic.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.450
In a sense, that's the big picture,

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.940
that Russia becomes this
kind of modern empire,

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.830
which is exactly how Peter and Catherine

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:56.820
were thinking about it.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.380
But in our picture, what's happening

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.590
is that these other three
entities are diminishing,

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.700
they're fighting one another,

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.890
and by the end of the 18th century,

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.690
they are essentially gone.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.750
Now, this geography is a mess.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.610
It's a mess, it's a mess, it's a mess

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.520
because we have to have in mind the zone

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.518
from the Baltic Sea to the
Black Sea the entire time.

00:04:19.518 --> 00:04:22.230
And we have to have in
mind inside Ukraine,

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.820
and this is where things really get hard,

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.870
we have to have in mind
the Black Sea, the Azov Sea

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.250
and then when we're
thinking about Ukraine,

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.450
you might have noticed in your reading

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.890
that there's constantly this mention

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.720
of right bank and left bank.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.410
Okay, now I'm now gonna blow your mind.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.410
The only way to understand
right bank and left bank

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.483
is that you have to think like a river.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.360
Yeah, exactly.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.050
You have to think like, this is serious.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.220
You have to think like a river.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.350
You have to know which
way does the river flow?

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.390
It flows from north to south.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.330
And so what is the left bank, right?

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.510
The left bank is the Eastern bank,

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.780
and the right bank is the Western bank.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.950
And so it's not, you know,

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.210
when you say right bank, left bank,

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.330
it's not right and left on
the map, it's the opposite

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.880
because right bank and left
bank are the banks of the river.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.710
And it's from the point
of view of the river.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.740
And if you can, you know,

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.450
I don't have time to do all the zen work

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.283
that's necessary here,

00:05:19.283 --> 00:05:24.060
but if you can think from the
point of view of the river,

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.340
you're also doing something very important

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.020
in terms of understanding the people.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.390
Because there's a reason
why right bank, left bank

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.090
seemed like a sensible
way to describe reality,

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.460
which is that so much of
what we're talking about

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.070
in terms of economics
and power had to do with

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.840
who was controlling the river,

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.880
who was making use of the river, right?

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.130
The river is so important to Ukraine,

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.260
the Dnipro is so important to Ukraine,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.630
that right bank, left bank
seemed like a sensible way

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.510
to describe the country for
hundreds and hundreds of years.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.340
And of course, that is still true.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.250
This is where the fighting
is going on right now, right?

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.620
This is the Ukrainian
army is trying to get to

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.950
the Dnieper River in
Kherson Oblast right now.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.540
Okay so all of these terms,

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.690
I'm afraid we sort of
have to keep in mind.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.110
So let me begin with what I promise to do

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.380
at the beginning of the class in which

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.330
I'm now gonna try to pay off that promise,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.610
which is to make sense of the Muslim world

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.070
and the Turkic world in Ukraine.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.710
Because as Serhii Plokhy reminds us

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.530
in the reading, the unification of Ukraine

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.910
is primarily a north to
south type enterprise.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.840
And we've gotten to where
the northern boundary

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.690
is going to be, when we get to 1569

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.950
and the Union of Lublin

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.820
and the Polish crown taking a great deal

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.160
of what had been Lithuania
away from Lithuania

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.690
and putting it under the Polish crown,

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:43.800
then we're getting to something like

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.420
the northern boundary of Ukraine.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.730
We're getting to a difference
between modern Belarus

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.870
and modern Ukraine.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.130
But the south,

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.140
we still have a lot of
work to do in the South.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.570
And it's complicated
work because it involves

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.410
seeing the Crimean Khanate,
seeing the Ottoman Empire,

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.140
and then watching how they get pushed out.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.580
And they're gonna get pushed out,

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.840
again jumping ahead a little bit,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.220
they're gonna get pushed
out by Ukrainian Cossacks

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.490
working for the Russian
imperial army, right?

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.690
So the pushing out of the Tatars, right?

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.480
The beginning of a process
of de-Turkification

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.330
and de-Islamization of
the Crimean Peninsula

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.170
is gonna be work that's done by Cossacks

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.660
when they are already
dominated and ruled by

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.560
and taking orders from
the Russian Empire, right?

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.050
So, but to make sense of all this now,

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.430
to do the South, to bring the South in,

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.900
I wanna start with the Crimean Khanate.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.510
Okay, so the southern
border of today's Ukraine,

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.090
which is the northern
coast of the Black Sea,

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.460
is a very special zone
from our point of view,

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.910
because this is the zone
where we do have sources,

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:52.760
basically the entire
time, like as much as,

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.230
so long as there's been like
a classical, ancient history,

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.320
we have sources for this little zone.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.900
It's different with Kyiv,
it's different from the north.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.580
There when we talk about Christianization,

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.920
we're also talking about the
beginning of written sources.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.330
Before Christianization,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.860
the written sources are very sparse,

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.140
they're Muslim visitors,
they're Jewish visitors,

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.690
but there aren't that
many written sources.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.270
On the coast of the Black
Sea, this is totally different

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.380
because the Greeks have
been there for 2,500 years

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.393
and they've left a written trace.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.590
The Greeks have been
there since 5,000 BCE.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.920
And they're there the entire time, right?

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.740
They're still there, although
not in great numbers.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.020
They're there the entire time.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.550
We can't go through
all of ancient history,

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:38.970
But they're there through Alexander,

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.903
they're there through Rome,
they're there through Byzantium.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:49.320
When Constantinople is sacked
for the first time in 1204

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.910
by Western Crusaders.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.230
So one thing one has to remember

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:54.330
when we're doing non-Western
European history,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:55.980
is that there were a lot of crusades,

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.360
and the crusades went in directions

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.590
that you might not have expected.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.510
So it turns out that if you're on the way

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.830
to liberate the Holy land,

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.470
it's a nice pit stop
to sack Constantinople,

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.230
which is what happened in 1204, right?

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.360
That isn't necessarily
something, or you know,

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.700
the crusades that we did
earlier with the crusaders

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.700
trying to kill slash convert
the pagan Balts, right?

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:17.970
Those are crusades.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.560
The history of the crusades
also involves Europeans

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.430
trying to convert Europeans,

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.900
or in the case of Constantinople,

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.820
just stealing a lot of nice things,

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.120
which you can now visit if
you go to Italy or France,

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.120
because Napoleon then stole
some of the good stuff again,

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.650
a second time later on.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.780
Okay, so the point is that

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.900
the Greeks are there the whole time.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.570
There's a classical
world which is durable,

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.773
linguistically, the entire
time on the South coast.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.360
So that's one part of Crimea

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.400
and that's what makes it special

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.443
And I want you to just mark that.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.960
So because it's gonna
be important later on.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.550
It's gonna be important
later on when we talk about

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.500
how Russia legitimates its claim.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:09.500
So the Crimean Hinterland
though is generally not touched

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.750
by Greek settlement.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.920
The Crimean Hinterland is
also not touched by Rus.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.940
So this is very important.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.520
We spend a whole lot of time
trying to understand Rus,

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.370
you understand how Rus
is a kind of synthesis of

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.170
Vikings coming from the north,

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.990
Byzantium coming from
the south, all of this.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.550
But Rus does not control
territorially Crimea.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.800
Rus does not control territorially,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.930
what's now Southern Ukraine either.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.480
So just note, you know,
this whole thing about

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.610
who does Rus belong to in this war

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.140
has this kind of strange feature

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.940
that the war is actually taking place

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.250
with the exception of a
little bit around Kharkiv,

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.580
it's generally taking
place where Rus was not,

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.830
as neither side is very keen to mention.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.020
Rus did not get this far south.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.510
It certainly did not get to Crimea.

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.870
So Rus did not get to
the Crimean Peninsula,

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.860
but the Mongols did, okay?

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.670
So in our world, in our class,
in East European history,

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.440
the Mongols are basically coming in

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.720
and they're breaking things up, right?

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.190
But from the Mongol point of view,

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.030
that's not what they're doing.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.500
They're establishing trade routes,

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.880
they're establishing states,

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.850
and the Mongols don't care if
you're Rus or you're not Rus,

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.460
I mean they're indifference
to what other people are

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.650
is quite extraordinary.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:28.380
What they're doing is
establishing big states.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.290
The big state in the region
was called the Golden Hoard,

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.820
which is a kind of unforgettable name.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.600
And then the history of
post Mongol statehood

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.490
is the Golden Hoard breaking
up into smaller units.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:46.490
One of those units is Moscow,
as we've discussed, right?

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.860
The Moscow state is a post Mongol state,

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.890
a post Mongol vassal state.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.250
Another one of these states
is called the Crimean Khanate.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.920
So Khanate, K-H-A-N-A-T-E.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.500
It's called a Khanate because
the ruler is called Khan,

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.880
K-H-A-N.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.520
So, Muscovite is a post Mongol state

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.890
as we've seen in the sense that

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:10.140
there were princes of Rus there

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.290
who were able to maintain
power by collecting the tribute

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.500
for their Mongol overlords.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.330
And then eventually after
a couple of centuries,

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.870
they break free, and then
they break out spectacularly

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.810
against other European
cities and then southward

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.520
against Muslims,

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.440
and then eastward all
the way to the Pacific

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.750
in a kind of spectacular
moment of expansion,

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:31.800
which is not really our subject,

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.270
but which is very
important for our subject

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.400
because it explains how the Russian Empire

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.370
is gonna be able to dominate
by the 18th century.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:41.580
The Crimean Khanate is a successor
state in a different way.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.670
The Crimean Khanate is ruled by princes

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:46.350
who are direct successors,

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.050
direct descendants of Genghis Khan,

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.720
the Princely class and
the Crimean Peninsula

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.840
and the Crimean Khanate
are direct successors,

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.670
by blood, at least so they
claim, of Genghis Khan

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.050
and they are ruling the people.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.660
The people who were there
before are Turkic speakers

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.670
mainly, I don't think
I put this on the list,

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.820
mainly from a group
that we call the Cuman.

00:13:10.344 --> 00:13:13.410
And the people who come into
being as the Crimean Tatars,

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:15.900
who were still known as the Crimean Tatars

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.230
are a synthesis of the
local Turkic speakers

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:24.120
plus the Mongolian ruling
classes who come in later.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:29.120
Okay so the Crimean Khanate
has a political system,

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.030
which is interestingly not so different

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:35.190
from Poland, Lithuania.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:39.870
They have an assembly of nobles,

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.267
which is called the (indistinct).

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.780
The Assembly of Nobles
theoretically elects the Khan,

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.820
just like the Polish Lithuanian parliament

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:51.210
theoretically elects the
king, although in both cases,

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.100
strangely, it's the same family

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.950
that gets elected again and
again for a couple of centuries,

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:59.640
which is nice if you can work it out.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.770
We know that the Khan who is the ruler

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:05.250
had a second in command who
was called the (indistinct).

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.130
We know that state functions
were held by nobles

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.773
from various post Mongol families.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.070
We know that women played a public role

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:18.810
until about the 1560s when
they disappear more or less

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.880
from the sources.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.680
And then we also know,

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.540
and this is where things
get very interesting,

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.470
that the Crimean Tatars
and the Crimean Khanate

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:32.580
had a centuries long
encounter with Lithuania,

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:37.560
which, if you look at your
map, will begin to make sense.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.990
If you remember in the 14th centuries

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:42.840
on one of your maps, on
the one from Magoshi,

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.750
you can see the dates he
gives for the Lithuanians

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.170
moving south into what's now
Belarus, what's now Ukraine.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:52.140
The Lithuanians move relentlessly south

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.750
as a result of the pressure
of Teutonic Knights, right?

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.240
Remember, they move relentlessly south,

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.523
they gather in the lens
of Rus, to coin a phrase.

00:15:00.523 --> 00:15:04.830
And they also, so if you
gather in the lens of Rus,

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.530
you are going to push up
against the Crimean Tatars.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.960
So the Lithuanians and the Crimean Tatars

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.080
are fighting regular
wars against each other

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.170
for decades and decades and decades.

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:18.240
And the Lithuanians, as one does,

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.280
are also constantly
trying to take advantage

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.670
of the various power struggles
and succession crises

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.800
inside the Crimean Khanate,

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.130
which means that the Lithuanians
are actually recruiting

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.890
dissenters, the people who
lose in these power struggles.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.450
There are also prisoners of war.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:37.230
They're recruiting Crimean
Tatars into their own state.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:39.330
So up until now, we've
talked about Lithuania

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.580
as being, oh, it's not
just a little Baltic state,

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.440
look it also controls Belarus,

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.820
look, it also controls Ukraine,

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.530
look, most of the population is Orthodox.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.720
Oh, and hey, the Lithuanian Grand Duke

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.370
married the Polish King, who was a girl.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.730
And so Lithuania becomes
a much bigger, bigger,

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.080
much bigger historical entity

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.460
than we're used to thinking about.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.380
But I now wanna add one more dimension.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.510
The Lithuanians had a
very meaningful encounter

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:02.430
with the Crimean Tatars,

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.230
which meant that among other things,

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:05.940
inside the Grand Duchy of Lithuania,

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.410
there were lots of Muslims.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.650
For centuries, for centuries,

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.572
there were mosques in (indistinct),

00:16:12.572 --> 00:16:15.240
there were mosques in
basically every meaningful town

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.250
in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.400
We've come across the city of Ostroh,

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.860
which one of the students
kindly asked about,

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.530
which is the place where the
first full Slavonic Bible

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:26.880
was printed.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.070
When the first full
Slavonic Bible was printed,

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.440
there was a mosque in Ostroh.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.650
The famous romantic poet, Adam Mickiewicz,

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:36.600
was born in a town called Novogrudok,

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.970
or in Belorussian, Navahrudak.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:42.030
That town also had a mosque

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.010
because of the Crimean Tatars, right?

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.770
Every town that mattered in
the Grand Dutch of Lithuania

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:50.190
had a mosque because
of the Crimean Tatars.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:54.870
So the point here is that for centuries,

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.720
there's an encounter between
Lithuania and the Tatars

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.190
because they are at war

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:00.420
and because they have a common border.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.550
And when Lithuania and
Poland come together,

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:04.890
then Poland Lithuania, we
can think about it like that,

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:08.850
from 1386 onward, Poland
Lithuania also has durable contact

00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:09.990
with the Crimean Tatars.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.120
And this is a very important part

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.070
of Polish Lithuanian identity.

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:17.430
If you go to the Royal Museum in Warsaw,

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.740
which I recommend, and you walk into it,

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.920
you'll wonder why like
you were in the first room

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.320
and suddenly there are all
these scimitars with gems

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.790
and things like this, and you think, wow,

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.740
this must be like war booty that the Poles

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:29.610
took from their enemies.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:32.880
But it's not, it's the
swords they used themselves

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.970
because they synthesized what they learned

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:38.550
from their long encounter
with the Crimean Tatars.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:43.550
Okay, so the Crimean Tatars
are an important state

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.540
for several hundred years.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:50.340
The tragedy of the Crimean
Khanate is that they fall under

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:55.230
Ottoman dependency at about the same time

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:59.310
that the Ottoman Empire
itself begins to weaken.

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:00.750
That's it in a word.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.420
So somewhere around 1650,

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:08.420
the Crimean Khanate yields to the Ottomans

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.070
in terms of setting its own policy.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.110
There had been a kind
of interaction of equals

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.390
for a couple of hundred
years where the Ottomans

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:19.260
basically farmed out their
northern foreign policy

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.640
to the Crimean Khanate

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.810
and the Crimean Khanate, you know,

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.880
decided what was going
to happen with Moscow,

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.380
with the Poles, with the Lithuanians.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.450
Around 1650, it looks like the Ottomans

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:28.650
are basically taking control.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.830
And the problem with this is
that it's around this time

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.470
that the Ottoman Empire becomes weak.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:38.910
Okay, so let me briefly now
try to do the Ottoman Empire.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.720
From our point of view, what's
crucial for the Ottomans

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.440
is the Ottoman Empire as a European power.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.710
Of course, the Ottoman Empire
also controls Northern Africa.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.570
It also controls Arab lands.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:55.200
It also controls the
Near East into Persia.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.080
But the Ottoman Empire,
from our point of view

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.390
in this very brief synthesis,

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.190
we have to think of it as a European power

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:06.240
which is pulling back from
Europe in the 17th century, okay?

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.380
That's the crucial thing.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.540
The Ottoman Empire is gaining control

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.740
over the Crimean Khanate,

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.620
but losing control of everything else.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.650
So you can justify thinking
of the Ottoman Empire

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:16.980
as a European power.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.140
The Ottomans, so the Osman family,

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.330
that's why they're called the
Ottomans, the Osman family,

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.680
O-S-M-O-N, they gain control
of Anatolia, today's Turkey,

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.810
for the same reason that the Lithuanians

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.270
gain control of territory
north of the Black Sea.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.370
The Osman family gains
control of territory

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.010
south of the Black Sea,
because the Mongols fragment

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.600
and pull back, right?

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.540
So whereas the Lithuanians
rush in north of the Black Sea,

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.570
the Ottomans rush in
south of the Black Sea,

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:46.470
and they conquer Anatolia.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:49.410
The next thing they do is
they conquer the Balkans.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:51.720
So the Ottomans are a European power,

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.280
basically from the beginning.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.600
They conquer other things as well,

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.870
but they're a European
power from the start.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.300
From our point of view, again,
there's much else to say,

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.883
but from our point of
view, the crucial struggle,

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.160
and I'm afraid this is where the geography

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.690
has to add one more dimension.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.910
The crucial struggle
is between the Ottomans

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:10.083
and the Hapsburgs.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:13.410
The Hapsburgs, who we're
gonna hear a lot about

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.330
after the exam a week from now,

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.500
the Hapsburgs are the family
that rules from Vienna,

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:24.500
which also has a big age of
exploration, age of discovery,

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.030
world empire, which
we're gonna talk about.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:31.140
The Ottomans are a very
important land empire,

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:35.220
which has been boxed up in
the Eastern Mediterranean

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.750
by superior navys,

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:39.450
and never breaks out into
the wider world, right?

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:42.240
So the Ottomans are in
this category of powers

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.380
that don't make it into this,
if you want, globalization,

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.640
this age of discovery.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.830
They're very powerful, they
control an awful lot of land.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:52.440
But unlike the Russian
Empire, unlike, and of course,

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.510
unlike the Portuguese,
the Spanish and so on,

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:56.460
they don't break outta the Mediterranean.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.110
They're stuck in the Mediterranean.

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:01.051
So from the point of view of Istanbul,

00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:05.670
the natural vector of
expansion is northward.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:09.300
And the story of the
16th and 17th centuries

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:14.300
is a couple of attempts
to besiege and control

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:17.430
the Hapsburg capital, which is Vienna.

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:18.263
In my other class,

00:21:18.263 --> 00:21:19.890
I spent a lot of time talking about this.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:22.170
Here we can only do it very briefly,

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:25.860
but the crucial point is
that a couple of times

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:30.180
the Ottomans try and fail to take Vienna.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.990
They try and fail in 1526.

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:38.990
In 1526, they gain control
of a lot of territory.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.610
They gain control of the land

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:46.230
which is on the west side
of the Black Sea, Moldavia,

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.780
Wallachia, the west side of the Black Sea.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.210
They gain control of most of Hungary,

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.460
but they don't take Vienna.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.950
They're gonna sit in
Hungary for 150 years,

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:58.263
but they don't get to Vienna.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:03.589
They try again in 1683.

00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:07.860
And this is a crucial turning
point for a lot of people.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.530
1683 is the famous moment

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:13.800
when the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.843
lifts the Ottoman siege of Vienna.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.140
In sort of conventional
histories of Europe

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.230
and how Europe is built, this
is a hugely important moment

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.720
because it's
counter-reformation, Catholicism,

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.540
Vienna and Warsaw together

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.000
defeating this Islamic army around Vienna.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.550
So huge amounts of Baroque
painting and symbolism

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:37.293
and recollection along
those lines of this event.

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:43.320
From our point of view, this
has some different resonances.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:48.120
So the king of Poland,
who liberates Vienna,

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.710
who raises the Ottoman siege of Vienna,

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.090
who's called Sobieski,

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.100
I probably forgot to
put his name on there.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.458
By the way, there are two
sides on the term sheet today,

00:22:56.458 --> 00:22:58.658
because that's the kind
of day we're having.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.490
Jan Sobieski is the king of Poland.

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:05.460
When he liberates, as
Ukrainians will tell you,

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.490
so you should visit this
if you're in Vienna,

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:10.080
which I know you all now will be,

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.360
if you're in Vienna, the little mountain

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.820
from which the Polish
Lithuanian army comes down

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.350
is called the Kahlenberg.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.050
And you can walk up it, it's a nice hike.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:20.460
You can take the bus up and walk down,

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.800
if you're not that energetic,
there's ice cream at the top.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.960
Lovely views, strongly recommend.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.135
Oh, and on the way down
there are these places called

00:23:27.135 --> 00:23:28.650
(indistinct), which have fresh wine

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:30.300
and like very simple
food, and it's lovely.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.680
So you should definitely all do this.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.630
But as any Ukrainian will tell you,

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:36.240
when the Polish Lithuanian
army comes crashing down

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.870
that mountain, they have 5,000
Ukrainian Cossacks with them,

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:41.204
okay?

00:23:41.204 --> 00:23:42.540
5,000 Ukrainian Cossacks.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.233
And then this brings us to
the more interesting thing.

00:23:46.276 --> 00:23:50.880
There was a problem, there
were many interesting problems

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.733
between the Austrian command
and the Polish command.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:58.470
And one of the problems
was that the Austrians

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.740
could not tell the
difference between the Poles

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.093
and the Crimean Tatars.

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:07.260
They literally could
not tell the difference.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:11.490
And so, because in dress and
attire and also in tactics,

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:12.720
they were very similar.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:17.550
And the Crimean Tatars, of
course, oh, I didn't say this,

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:20.580
but the Crimean Tatars were there in 1683

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.500
on the Ottoman side, right?

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.670
On the Ottoman side.

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:28.020
So these Poles, Pol
Lithuanians and Crimean Tatars,

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:30.120
who've been fighting on their
own border for a long time,

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.040
are now fighting in
somebody else's border.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.070
Like if you imagine Crimean
Tatars, 10,000 of them

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:38.880
in and around Vienna,
fighting the Polish army

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.380
coming down from the mountain, right?

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.560
And the Viennese cannot tell the Poles,

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.230
cannot tell the Lithuanians
from the Crimean Tatars, right?

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.530
Because of the hairstyles,
because of the scimitars, right?

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.410
Because of the calvary, they
cannot tell the difference.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:55.110
And so the decision that
was made was that the Poles

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:58.380
are going to put a bit of
straw in their helmets.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.940
You know, the way modern
armies will have a color

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.160
on their sleeves or whatever.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.170
Like the Ukrainians
and the Russians today,

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:05.850
the Poles will put a bit
of straw in their helmets,

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:08.760
so that the Austrians
could tell who they were.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.350
So it's an anecdote, it's funny,

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:12.690
but it reveals something
which is deeply true,

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:16.350
which is that this long,
centuries long encounter

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:17.607
between the Lithuanians and the Tatars,

00:25:17.607 --> 00:25:19.950
and then the Poles and
Lithuanians and the Tatars,

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:23.130
mark them just as it
marks the Cossacks, right?

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.190
The Viennese, of course
couldn't tell the Cossacks

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:27.240
from the Tatars, right?

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.320
That goes without saying,

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.370
because the interaction between

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:30.540
the Cossacks and the Tatars

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.210
has been even more
intimate for even longer,

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:35.370
because the Cossacks are
precisely the people

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:38.670
who found that free spot
between Polish Lithuanian power

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:41.460
and the Crimean Tatars
and lived in that spot,

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.070
lived in it geographically,
lived in it culturally.

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:49.070
Okay, so the 1683 victory
is most important for us

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.070
because it leads to 1699.

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:56.100
If we're off in central European history,

00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:00.030
1683 is the moment when the
Austrians turn the tables

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.320
on the Ottomans.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.540
And not only do they defend
themselves in Vienna,

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.820
but between 1683 and 1699,

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:08.460
they fight their way
southward through the Balkans,

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.710
and they establish
themselves as a land power

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.870
in the Balkans, which is
the beginning of the story,

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:14.940
which will eventually lead
to the First World War,

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.440
different class.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.970
But for our point of view,

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:22.770
when the Ottomans have to
sign a peace tree in 1699,

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:24.420
which by the way is the
first time they have to sign

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.130
a peace treaty as a defeated power,

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:28.770
when they have to sign
a peace treaty in 1699,

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:30.690
that changes the balance of power

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.060
in our part of the world, right?

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:35.220
The Ottomans have been defeated,

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:39.120
their armies have been
defeated in Southern Europe.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.380
The treaty which is signed

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:44.040
is the Treaty of Karlowitz in
1699, the Treaty of Karlowitz,

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.750
that's the time when the
Ottomans sign a treaty

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.010
as a defeated power.

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:51.210
Hugely important turning
point in the balance of power,

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:54.842
because as I said, the Crimean Tatars

00:26:54.842 --> 00:26:57.030
they're now basically
hitched to the Ottomans.

00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:58.860
They're hitched to the
Ottomans at a moment

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.821
when the Ottomans then lose
this big important war.

00:27:01.821 --> 00:27:06.330
And Ottoman power has been
driven southward, okay?

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:07.860
Now that changes everything.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.080
That changes everything for the Russians

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.970
as we're gonna see in a moment.

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.730
Okay, now, before I get to the Russians,

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:17.043
we've gotta briefly talk about Cossacks,

00:27:19.929 --> 00:27:21.540
the Ukrainian Cossack state.

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.480
So the Ukrainian Cossack state

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.010
gets blurred out of Polish history,

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:28.020
gets blurred out of Russian history.

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:32.490
We have 1648, which everyone
is keen to treat as a violent,

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.170
you know, moment of violent rebellion,

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.250
which of course it was,

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:36.630
but that's not the only thing that it was,

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.150
it was also the construction
of a new political order

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:42.900
in which the governing
elite has been driven away

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.480
or physically eliminated
or discredited, right?

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.100
So it's also something like a revolution

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:51.360
in which a new class emerges
to control territory,

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:56.040
which are the Cossacks
and the Cossack officers.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.160
Now, these Cossacks and
Cossack officers, however,

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.400
are not in the position after 1648

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.380
to rule territory themselves.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.530
They are constantly forced
to align with the Russians

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.680
as in 1648, sometimes
still with the Poles,

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.780
sometimes with the Ottomans,

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.850
which is why this lecture
is called "The Triangle".

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:17.280
There is something like
Ukrainian statehood,

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.340
it's called the Hetmanate,
after the Hetman.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:24.240
But the Hetmanate is
constantly bending and turning

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.850
and being turned against itself, right?

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:30.510
So you have right bank Hetmans,
you have left bank Hetmans,

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:32.880
you have Hetmans who
are trying to rule both

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.010
the right wing and the left wing.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.740
You have a Hetman called Doroshenko,

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.290
who I hope I put on the
list, tell me if I didn't.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:45.290
But Doroshenko in 1669 becomes
a vessel of the Ottomans

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.890
in order to try to unite the right bank

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:54.570
and the left bank where the
right bank is controlled by

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:57.240
the Russians, the left bank
is controlled by the Poles.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.360
So if you're a Hetman, your great project

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.460
is to bring these things together

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.380
and then ideally to
shove everybody else out.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.963
But that they're not able to do.

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:12.480
So, okay, this is another date and treaty.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.310
So I'm gonna tell you right off,

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.320
if you're paying attention,
you're right here with me,

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.200
these dates and these treaties
are gonna be on the exam,

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.033
all right?

00:29:20.033 --> 00:29:21.180
They're gonna be on the exam,

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.470
know the dates of the treaties.

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:26.070
So the Treaty of Andrusova, 1667,

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:28.830
that is when the Poles and the Russians,

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:30.930
lots of inspired note taking now.

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:34.350
That's when the Poles and
the Russians divide Ukraine,

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:37.800
left bank and right bank,
1667 Treaty of Andrusova.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.920
Which means that now you have Hetmans,

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.530
you have leaders of the
Cossacks on both sides, right?

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:44.910
And of course, if you're on one side,

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:47.490
your greatest aspiration is
to be also on the other side.

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:48.955
And then your next aspiration

00:29:48.955 --> 00:29:52.020
is then to get clear of
whoever was sponsoring you,

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.210
whether that's the Russians
or the Poles or the Ottomans.

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:55.260
That's the triangle.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.370
You wanna bring it all together.

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:58.440
And then you wanna drive
out whoever sponsored you.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.600
They don't manage to do
this, but that's the pattern.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.540
So 1672, Doroshenko helps the Ottomans

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:09.803
to defeat the Poles in Podolia, okay?

00:30:09.803 --> 00:30:14.763
Podolia is this region
in South Western Ukraine.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:17.610
And then after that happens,

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:20.490
so the Ottomans then control
Podolia, which I'm gonna,

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:24.030
you guys write down Podolia,
please, just like it sounds.

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:28.740
They control Podolia and
then at the end of the 1670s,

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.570
the Ottomans make peace with Poland.

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:34.290
In 1681, you're gonna see
how this fits together,

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:38.700
in 1681, the Ottomans make
peace with the Russians, okay?

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.407
So now the Ottomans are
at peace with the Poles

00:30:40.407 --> 00:30:43.770
and the Russians, it's
1681, what do they then do?

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:46.770
They make their big move
northwards to Vienna

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:48.360
and fail, right?

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.800
So important.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:54.390
Their move is to go to
Vienna and they fail.

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:56.670
Okay and so then everything turns around.

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.310
After 1683, the Ottomans are driven south.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:01.050
The Crimeans have been defeated.

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:02.310
The Crimean Khan, by the way,

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:06.990
takes personal responsibility
for the defeat and retires.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:11.990
And in 1699, the Poles take Podolia back.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.660
The Poles take Podolia back.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:16.560
And the reason why,

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.660
there are many reasons why
we're concerned about this,

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:23.040
but one of the reasons why
we're so interested in Podolia

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:27.120
is because of the way that
Brooklyn looks like now,

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:32.057
so have you heard of the Hasidism, right?

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:36.903
So it's a version of Jewish orthodoxy.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.140
It's present on Yale's campus.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.933
You don't have to look
too hard to find it.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.980
So, okay, I gotta stop
myself, that was a tangent.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:50.580
See, in the 18th century, you
have no time for tangents.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.200
That's what the 18th century is like.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.530
So no tangents, but Hasidism,

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:59.160
which is a version of Orthodox Judaism,

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.880
which is still let's say thriving.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.100
It's one of the reasons
why Yiddish still exists

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:09.660
as a language is created in Podolia

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.730
after the Poles come back.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:12.563
And the reason why,

00:32:12.563 --> 00:32:14.280
I'll tell you what Hasidism
is in a moment very briefly,

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.620
but the reason why it arises

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:19.560
is that it's in this
territory which has shifted

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:23.280
from Muslim Ottoman
control back and forth to

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.690
Polish Christian control.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:26.970
And this whole Polish system of coming in

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:28.650
with the aristocracy and the serfdom,

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:30.150
and then going back out
with the aristocracy

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:30.983
and the serfdom,

00:32:30.983 --> 00:32:33.120
then coming back in with the
aristocracy and the serfdom,

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.970
is very disruptive for the
Ukrainians who rebel against it.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:40.200
And in this whole boiling
atmosphere in Podolia

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.810
is what gives rise to Hasidism.

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:46.733
Where Hasidism is created by
someone who's called the Besht.

00:32:47.763 --> 00:32:51.420
Besht means the Ba'al Shem Tov,
the Master of the Good Word.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:56.420
Very briefly, the idea of
Hasidism is to give to Judaism

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:03.480
a kind of a more earthly
and more corporeal component

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:07.530
where joy and direct
contact with the mystic

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:08.760
are more important.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.510
It's also a movement which has
to do with the printing press

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:15.270
and access to the book by
people who are not necessarily

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:16.260
completely literate.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:19.230
Which let's admit, like not
everybody is completely,

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:20.657
you know, there's a funny moment, right?

00:33:20.657 --> 00:33:23.820
'Cause the printing press
runs ahead of literacy

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.860
by several hundred years, right?

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.934
Kind of like the internet
now, you know, like

00:33:27.934 --> 00:33:30.630
the technology is way
out ahead of what people,

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:31.620
it's a good analogy actually.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:32.790
Because what people did with books

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:34.530
when they're first published,
they did things like,

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:36.720
oh look, I know that letter.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.220
Maybe it stands for something.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.920
And that's kabbala.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.200
That's one way of
reading the Bible, right?

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.410
Is you don't, like, you take
various combinations of letters

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:48.510
and you say, okay there's a hidden meaning

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:50.010
in this biblical verse, right?

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:51.600
That's a way of interpreting the Bible,

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.010
a much more accessible way,

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:55.410
which is associated
with Hasidism precisely.

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:57.450
So it also has to do with printing press

00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:00.330
at a time of limited literacy.

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:03.780
So the reason why I
mention this is because

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:07.410
it's the next step in the
history of Jews in Ukraine,

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:08.243
Hasidism.

00:34:08.243 --> 00:34:11.730
And Hasidism is also a
version of Orthodox Judaism,

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:14.310
which is going to break out
of Podolia and into Ukraine

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:18.810
and into Poland and
eventually into North America.

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:21.090
Okay, so no time for tangents.

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:23.190
There was time for a
parenthesis on the Hassids.

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:24.660
Now I'm closing that parenthesis

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:27.210
and we're getting back
to where we need to be,

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:29.640
which is Russia.

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:31.170
Okay, so now let's think about all this

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:34.380
from the point of view of Russia.

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:36.524
What the Russians are able to do,

00:34:36.524 --> 00:34:41.524
what the new Russian empire,
as it's called from 1721.

00:34:42.175 --> 00:34:45.540
And by the way, Russian
Empire is a conscious

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.550
rebranding exercise, right?

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:50.040
It's called Russia because of Russ,

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.660
not the other way around, right?

00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:53.400
I mean, I realize you're history students,

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.680
so you know that like
chronology is very important.

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:59.790
So Russia is called Russia
because it's named after Russ.

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:02.280
Russ was not called Russ because
it was named after Russia.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.330
And once you get that straight,

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:05.970
a lot of other things fall into place.

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:10.560
Okay, so in the 18th century,
Russia makes its move

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.260
back into Europe with tremendous success

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:16.743
under two great rulers,
Peter and Catherine.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.920
So how does this happen?

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.985
The Ottomans are down, right?

00:35:21.985 --> 00:35:25.380
They're defeated and they're in the south.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:30.180
Between 1683 and 1699,
they're being driven southward

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:34.920
and Russia takes advantage
of this by going north,

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.080
going to the Baltic again.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.080
We saw how Ivan the Terrible

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.670
foundered on the shores of the Baltic,

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:44.280
he starts the Livonian wars,

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.950
which he basically
loses the Livonian wars,

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.470
bring the Poles and
Lithuanians closer together,

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:51.840
Union of Lublin, all of that.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.300
And then there's terror
inside the Muscovite state.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.960
This time, the move to
the Baltic succeeds.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.050
The great northern war
that begins in 1700,

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:04.200
which is only one year after
1699, by no coincidence,

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.330
the Great Northern War
which begins in 1700,

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:09.180
it turns out to be a Russian victory.

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:12.360
But this great northern war
turns out to be Russian victory,

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.543
partly because the Cossacks
are fighting there,

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.600
but they're fighting with
the Ukrainian Cossacks,

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.950
but they're fighting there

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:22.290
in conditions which are
highly unfavorable, right?

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.870
So the Cossacks have been
fighting for hundreds of years

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.520
with and against the Polls,

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.230
with and against the Lithuanians,

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.060
with and against the Tatars, right?

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.500
That's with the Tatars too.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.690
The Khmelnytsky Uprising
was with the Tatars

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:35.850
against the Poles, it's a triangle.

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:39.360
You have to lie with pretty much everybody

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.560
in different circumstances.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.393
So, but anyway,

00:36:41.393 --> 00:36:44.220
that is their home turf down there, right?

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.830
With the Tatars, with the
Poles, with the Lithuanians.

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:50.130
When they are brought
up to fight in Sweden,

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:52.860
in northern Europe, they're
facing a modern army

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:56.220
with modern weapons, they're
taking huge casualties,

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:57.690
they're far away from home

00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:01.590
and they're taking orders from
Russian imperial officers,

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:04.140
all of which leads to a
great deal of discontent.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.690
Meanwhile, while they're up north,

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.693
Poland threatens to invade Ukraine.

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:15.650
And the Hetman, who is the
Hetman of the left bank,

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:18.210
the Hetman of the Russian part of Ukraine,

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.240
who is a man called Ivan Mazepa,

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.940
realizes that we're now
in a moment of crisis.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:28.023
And so Mazepa makes a decision,
which is quite fateful.

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:32.040
Mazepa makes the decision in 1708

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.040
to switch over to the Swedish side, okay?

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.810
So there are operas about this,

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:38.460
there's lots of Russian
literature about this.

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:41.370
And it's like, it's the great betrayal by,

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:42.930
it rings down the century,

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:44.220
literally rings down the centuries,

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.170
because Russian bells
were supposed to ring out

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:47.763
because of Mazepa's betrayal.

00:37:50.266 --> 00:37:53.010
Mazepa had been a kind of
counselor to Peter, okay?

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:55.410
Mazepa is older than Peter,

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:58.350
Mazepa had this fantastic
European education.

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.600
He'd been the counselor
to the King of Poland.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.760
He'd been educated at the Kyiv Academy.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.160
Then he was educated by Jesuits in Poland,

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.260
then he was the counselor to
the King of Poland, right?

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:12.180
And so he then became a
kind of counselor to Peter

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.013
in his turn.

00:38:13.013 --> 00:38:14.280
And Peter trusted him.

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:18.630
So in 1708, when Mazepa switches sides,

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.430
which he believes he
has no choice but to do,

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:22.260
to try to preserve his homeland,

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:25.050
Peter sees this understandably
as a huge betrayal.

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:26.910
And it's remembered as
a tremendous betrayal,

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:30.000
as a moment where the Ukrainians
betrayed the Russians.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.110
So Mazepa switches sides to the Swedes,

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:37.140
right before they lose,
right before they lose.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:42.140
In 1709 at the Battle of Poltava,
Russia defeats the Swedes,

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:46.830
reaches the Baltic and
becomes a North European power

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.500
that is then gonna be followed 1721,

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.050
founding of the Russian Empire,

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.051
the creation of Petersburg,

00:38:54.051 --> 00:38:59.051
new European capital, window
on Europe, all of that.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.233
Mazepa dies in 1709.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:05.880
So this is a turning
point for the Cossacks.

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.860
I mean, Cossack power
probably wasn't gonna persist

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:10.110
much longer anyway, but
it's a turning point.

00:39:11.719 --> 00:39:14.100
Mazepa dies that same year, 1709.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:19.100
1719, the Cossacks are
banned from selling grain,

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:22.710
not a detail.

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:24.510
They're banned from
selling grain on their own.

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:26.520
They can only sell grain
through Russian ports.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.250
And since we know that part
of the deep history of Ukraine

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:31.530
is that Ukraine has the most fertile soil

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:32.820
in this part of the world,

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:37.140
that ban is a big part of
their dependency on Russia.

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:40.200
1722, the Russians create something called

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.300
the Little Russian Collegium,

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:45.090
which is going to co-rule
or eventually rule

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:46.080
the Cossack lands.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.840
Little Russia, Malorussia

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.110
is then a Russian term for
which I'll talk more about later

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:54.453
for referring to Ukraine.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.603
So after these turning points, right?

00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:01.320
After 1699, Battle of Karlowitz, sorry,

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.220
the Treaty of Karlowitz,

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:05.700
and after 1709, the Battle of Poltava,

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:09.150
the Ottomans are down
and the Swedes are down,

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:11.370
and the Russians have
basically a free hand

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:12.300
with the Cossacks

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:15.780
and they're using the
Cossacks to fight the Swedes.

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.520
And then they're using the Cossacks

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:21.570
to fight the Crimean Khanate
and to fight the Ottomans.

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:22.740
That's the way it goes.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:27.450
So you can see the Cossack
power is being spent northward

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:29.643
and being spent southward.

00:40:30.516 --> 00:40:33.150
In the 18th century in
a series of battles,

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:36.930
the Russians managed
to drive Crimean power

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:39.480
out of what is now southern Ukraine.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:43.590
And then eventually they manage
to conquer Crimea itself.

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:47.250
This happens in a couple
of wars, 1735 to 1739,

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:49.290
then 1768 to 1774.

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:56.770
Crimea becomes a
protectorate that year, 1774.

00:40:56.770 --> 00:41:00.300
1783, its annexed by the Russian Empire.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.180
Now, while this is happening,

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:06.240
while the Cossacks are
being played out, right?

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.540
Cossack power is being spent
in these wars southward,

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.130
it's not that it's new that the Cossacks

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:12.480
are fighting the Crimean Tatars,

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.650
they've been doing that forever.

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:16.470
What's new is that they're
doing it under Russian command.

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:19.230
And when that job is done,

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:22.470
all that remains of their
autonomy is taken away, right?

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:25.260
So you're seeing this
triangle kind of crushes in

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.093
on everyone at the same time.

00:41:28.158 --> 00:41:30.690
The Crimean Khanate is
being defeated by Ottomans,

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:34.350
but in that defeat, sorry,
it's being defeated by Cossacks.

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:35.700
And, but in that defeat,

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:38.370
the Cossacks are also being
defeated by Russia, right?

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:43.200
The institutions of the
Cossacks are going to disappear

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.990
at basically the same
time that the institutions

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:48.600
of the Crimean Khanate
are going to disappear.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.490
And then they are swept up.

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:52.890
And here's where things get
intellectually very interesting.

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:57.890
They are then swept up by
Catherine's idea of a new Russia.

00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:04.773
Okay, so this is fascinating
because what Catherine does,

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:10.820
educated woman, German, by the
way, her real name is Sophie.

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:14.250
And there's nothing Russian about her

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:16.620
except the husbands who had to be murdered

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:19.113
so she could rule, that's it.

00:42:20.207 --> 00:42:25.207
So Catherine has this idea,
which is very elegant.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.920
It's also a classically colonial idea

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.580
that these lands that
have just been conquered,

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.860
there wasn't anybody there, right?

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.603
These are virgin territories.

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:41.740
So the place is renamed
what's now Southern Ukraine

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:47.010
where the Cossacks had had
power and the Crimean Peninsula

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:49.080
where the Crimean Khanate had had power,

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.930
these places are renamed New Russia, okay?

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:55.560
Now that word new is magical, right?

00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:00.240
Like with New England or New
South Wales or New Caledonia,

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.090
that word new is magical
because it suggests

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:06.030
this is our new Russia.

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:07.500
It's powerful, right?

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.670
It's powerful.

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:13.670
More than 200, you know, 200
years later, 300 years later,

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:16.680
people are gonna be still
drawn by this notion

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.390
of New Russia.

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:19.380
But when you say something is new,

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:20.280
you're not saying it's yours,

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:22.920
you're saying that we
want it to be ours, right?

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.450
That's the whole point.

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:27.000
So Novorossiya does not mean
something which is Russian,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.480
it means something that
we're gonna make Russia,

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.150
we're gonna pretend that
nothing else is there.

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:34.530
And how do you do that?

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:37.590
Well, you send multiple,
and the Russians did this,

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:40.470
they sent four expeditions of the

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:43.800
Russian Imperial Academy
of Sciences to Crimea

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.830
to name everything, find all the species,

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:48.330
map everything, right?

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:50.520
Because science is one of the tools

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.920
by which you gather imperial knowledge.

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.470
And then the naming, I mean, this is,

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:57.090
one has to admit this is quite brilliant

00:43:57.090 --> 00:44:00.060
on Catherine's part,
they rename everything.

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:03.450
So all the Turkic names, the Muslim names,

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:07.080
the Crimean Tatar names are replaced.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.603
And what are they replaced with?

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:14.490
Greek names or names that sound Greek,

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:16.290
like Kherson, okay?

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:17.220
Like Kherson,

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:19.320
that city that's being
fought over right now.

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:22.020
Kherson, completely invented name, right?

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.210
Or it comes from the
Greek city of Kherson,

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:25.923
which is in Crimea.

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:30.960
Mariupol, sounds Greek sorta, right?

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.400
That's the whole idea.

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.110
They took the old names

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:35.550
and then they replaced
'em with Greek names.

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:37.170
And when they founded new places,

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:39.038
those two examples I gave are new places,

00:44:39.038 --> 00:44:40.080
Kherson and Mariupol,

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.450
they gave them Greek or
Greek-ish, Greek sounding,

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:44.010
Greco whatever names.

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:46.740
And the point of this is to say

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:50.730
Russia is connected with
the classical world, right?

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:53.067
And in that we're European, right?

00:44:53.067 --> 00:44:54.813
We're in the enlightenment.

00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:58.770
Connecting Russia with
the classical world,

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:01.320
going back all the way 2000 years,

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.460
means that you obliterative

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.410
everything that happens in between.

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:07.811
So the Crimeans don't matter,
the Ukrainians don't matter,

00:45:07.811 --> 00:45:11.910
it's Russia here alone with
its historical destiny,

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:14.190
which goes all the way back to Greece.

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:18.180
And so it's new Russia, but it's justified

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:21.510
by this connection to the classical world.

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:24.633
Okay, that brings us
to where we need to be.

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.750
The Crimean Tatars themselves

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:30.330
are going to be physically displaced.

00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:33.300
About a third of them,
roughly 300,000 of them

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:34.530
are going to immigrate

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:36.180
while Russia takes
control of the peninsula,

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:37.800
most (indistinct) Ottoman Empire.

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:40.260
During the Crimean War of the 1850s,

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:44.160
another 140,000 Crimean
Tatars are going to leave.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.480
Jumping ahead a bit,

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.580
the remainder of the
Crimean Tatar population

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.100
is going to be deported
every man, woman and child

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.830
in 1944 under Soviet rule,

00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:55.500
so that the entire peninsula is deprived

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.083
of its indigenous population.

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:02.940
The Ukrainians, and this
is the very last thing,

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:06.990
when this is all over, when the
Cossacks have been disbanded,

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:08.940
when the territories have been integrated

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:12.750
into new Russia districts,
as soon as that happens,

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:14.880
in the spirit of romanticism,

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:19.830
the Ukrainians from a new
university in today's Kharkiv,

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:22.290
what was called Kharkov
in Russian back then,

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:24.870
from a new university,
which is founded in 1805,

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:26.670
the first move is going to be

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:30.630
classical traditional
European style romanticism,

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:33.360
where they start looking
back to the Cossack past

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.780
and start writing about
Cossack state continuities.

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:40.080
And in the 19th century,
they will move into a mode

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:42.690
where they turn their own
past into something like

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:46.860
a usable national story, which
we're gonna talk more about

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:49.590
in the weeks to come.

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:51.900
For the Crimean Tatars,
for various reasons,

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.420
this wasn't possible.

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:55.890
The Crimean Tatars aren't gonna be able

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:56.760
to make a move like this.

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.890
They're going to be largely dispersed

00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:00.180
and they're gonna be treated as alien

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:03.570
and their domination is
gonna be much more complete.

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:04.710
I'm gonna talk more about that

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:05.543
when we get to the 20th century,

00:47:05.543 --> 00:47:07.860
'cause it's really interesting in itself

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:08.850
and it's very important

00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:10.890
for the way that the war is being fought.

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:12.690
Just one closing thought.

00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:16.590
People find it easier to think
that Crimea is really Russia

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:19.650
than Ukraine is really Russia, right?

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:20.850
Today.

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:21.900
And why is that?

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:25.410
I mean, it's because the
history of Crimea has been,

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:26.610
although the history of Ukraine

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:29.400
has been pretty successfully obliterated,

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.450
the history of Crimea

00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:32.760
has been very successfully obliterated.

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.970
And so the idea that
Ukraine is always Russia,

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:38.460
maybe like, you know,
you might ask a question,

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:40.290
but Crimea is always Russia?

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:43.560
People are more likely
to believe that, right?

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.170
And so part of the work that
we have to do in history

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:47.580
is to fill in the gaps

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.070
and get things where they were in the past

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:53.460
and make these always claims,
whatever they might be,

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:54.780
seem unbelievable.

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:58.020
And in that way, prepare
ourselves for the exam.

00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:58.853
Good luck.

00:47:58.853 --> 00:48:03.770
1699, 1699 is definitely gonna
be on this exam, 100%, 1699.

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:07.890
Okay, thank you everybody,
thanks for listening.

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:09.570
The 18th century is tough work

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:11.543
and I appreciate that you're here with me.

00:48:15.099 --> 00:48:17.516
(soft music)

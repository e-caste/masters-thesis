00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.140
Prof: Good morning.
 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.236
Today's lecture is entitled
"The Prince and the Palace:

00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:10.500
Human Made Divine on the
Palatine Hill."

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.030
And I want to begin essentially
where we left off,

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.680
and that is with the emperor
Vespasian,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.730
the founder of the Flavian
dynasty,

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.370
and the political shrewdness
that Vespasian demonstrated,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.110
when he made the decisions that
he did --

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.330
when he made the decision
especially to use architecture

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.940
to further his political agenda.
 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.006
And you'll recall that the way
in which he did that was that

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:42.643
he--
and I'm going to show you the

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:47.090
site plan once again on the
Esquiline and Palatine Hills;

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.110
the site plan that shows us how
he did this.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.157
How he did this was he
recognized that he didn't want

00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:57.358
to associate himself with Nero,
but it was to his advantage to

00:00:57.358 --> 00:01:01.259
associate himself instead with
the emperor Claudius.

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:07.349
And he did that by finishing
the platform,

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:13.468
and indeed the temple itself
that we looked at last time,

00:01:13.468 --> 00:01:16.610
and that is the Temple of the
Divine Claudius,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.138
the Claudianum,
that had been begun by

00:01:19.138 --> 00:01:20.780
Agrippina the Younger.
 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.950
He completed that as a nod to
Claudius;

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.480
and again, a very smart
political move on his part.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.718
He also, as you'll recall,
razed the Domus Aurea of Nero

00:01:29.718 --> 00:01:32.769
to the ground,
covered up what was left of it

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:35.049
otherwise,
and then he filled in the

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.055
artificial lake,
and he used the property that

00:01:38.055 --> 00:01:41.553
the artificial lake was on,
to build the Colosseum,

00:01:41.553 --> 00:01:45.110
which itself was a shrewd gift
to the Roman people,

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.525
to gain their favor,
and he did succeed in that

00:01:49.525 --> 00:01:50.390
regard.
 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.769
Equally important,
perhaps even more important,

00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:59.290
is the decision that Vespasian
made in the year 79 A.D.,

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.795
and that decision--and we see a
portrait once again of

00:02:01.795 --> 00:02:03.768
Vespasian,
on the right-hand side of the

00:02:03.768 --> 00:02:06.494
screen,
now in Copenhagen--the decision

00:02:06.494 --> 00:02:09.840
he made in 79 was to appoint his
elder son,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.110
Titus, as co-regent.
 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.813
And we see a portrait of Titus
on the left-hand side of the

00:02:16.813 --> 00:02:18.729
screen, in military costume.
 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:24.000
It's a portrait that was found
in Herculaneum,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.044
so that we know it needs to
date prior to 79:

00:02:27.044 --> 00:02:30.090
so very likely sometime in the
seventies,

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.568
that particular statue was put
up.

00:02:32.568 --> 00:02:37.220
Now the reason it was smart
politically to appoint Titus as

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.470
his co-regent was that Titus was
extremely capable.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.807
He was also extremely popular
in Rome, with the people,

00:02:45.807 --> 00:02:49.424
with the Senate,
and what it did was to ensure

00:02:49.424 --> 00:02:53.038
the succession:
to ensure the succession.

00:02:53.038 --> 00:02:57.990
And so when Vespasian died of
natural causes in 79 A.D.,

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.348
Titus was prepared to take
over, and indeed he did,

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:05.750
and he took over without any
contest whatsoever,

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.438
which was a great
accomplishment.

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:12.522
Titus, however--oh,
and Titus, by the way,

00:03:12.522 --> 00:03:16.008
was young when he became
emperor;

00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:18.187
he was in his early thirties,
about thirty-two,

00:03:18.187 --> 00:03:20.270
full of energy,
and he needed it for what lay

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.878
ahead, because he was unlucky.
 

00:03:21.878 --> 00:03:26.501
And his reign was affected by
three major events,

00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:30.929
the first of which you know
intimately already,

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:35.840
and that is the eruption of
Vesuvius in 79 A.D.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.910
Titus' reign was 79 to 81.
 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.334
So in 79 A.D.,
Vesuvius erupts and Titus has

00:03:42.334 --> 00:03:46.395
to deal with the consequences of
that, covered over,

00:03:46.395 --> 00:03:49.979
as you well know,
almost all of Campania.

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:54.259
In the year 80 he suffered,
or Rome suffered,

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:59.123
a very serious plague,
which Titus also had to deal

00:03:59.123 --> 00:04:00.000
with.
 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.846
He had to marshal all of his
energy and all his ingenuity to

00:04:03.846 --> 00:04:06.650
deal with a very serious plague
in Rome,

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.490
and that plague was followed by
a fire,

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.770
also an exceedingly serious
fire.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.804
So Titus had his hands full,
and perhaps it's not

00:04:15.804 --> 00:04:18.805
surprising,
given all the stress of those

00:04:18.805 --> 00:04:22.379
years that he too died of
natural causes in 81,

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:24.269
at a very young age.
 

00:04:24.269 --> 00:04:28.040
But despite what he went
through during 79 to 81,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.165
Titus' claim to fame was
something that happened much

00:04:32.165 --> 00:04:34.911
earlier,
and I've mentioned it before,

00:04:34.911 --> 00:04:38.399
and that is something that
happened already in the year

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.656
A.D.
 

00:04:38.656 --> 00:04:39.110
70.
 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.190
And it was in the year A.D.
 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.966
70 that Vespasian sent his
elder son to Jerusalem,

00:04:44.966 --> 00:04:49.050
to Judea, to get involved in a
major military war.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.870
And it was Titus,
as you'll recall,

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.598
who was victorious in the
Jewish Wars, and that took place

00:04:56.598 --> 00:04:57.759
in 70 A.D.
 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:01.327
And it was extremely important,
not only in itself,

00:05:01.327 --> 00:05:04.968
from Rome's standpoint,
but also because it provided

00:05:04.968 --> 00:05:07.680
legitimacy to the Flavian
dynasty.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.726
I mentioned that when a Roman
dynasty came to power in a civil

00:05:13.726 --> 00:05:15.545
war--
which was the case,

00:05:15.545 --> 00:05:19.339
both for Augustus,
after the civil war that Rome

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:22.939
was plunged into after Caesar's
death,

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:27.507
and was the case again for
Vespasian after the chaos of the

00:05:27.507 --> 00:05:30.634
year 68/69--
they needed a foreign victory

00:05:30.634 --> 00:05:32.028
to gain legitimacy.
 

00:05:32.028 --> 00:05:35.843
So for the Flavian dynasty,
the war over Jerusalem gave

00:05:35.843 --> 00:05:40.218
them that legitimacy,
and was therefore extremely

00:05:40.218 --> 00:05:45.778
important in terms of the art
and ideology of the Flavian

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:46.870
dynasty.
 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:53.214
I want to turn to an arch that
was put up in honor of that very

00:05:53.214 --> 00:05:57.512
victory over Jerusalem,
sometime after A.D.

00:05:57.512 --> 00:05:58.230
81.
 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.040
It was the so-called Arch of
Titus,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.360
one of the most famous Roman
monuments of all,

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.850
and it was put up,
although it bears Titus' name,

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:12.050
it was put up not by him,
but by his brother Domitian,

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.853
his younger brother Domitian,
who succeeded him after Titus'

00:06:13.853 --> 00:06:16.298
death,
which is why we date it to

00:06:16.298 --> 00:06:17.882
sometime after A.D.
 

00:06:17.882 --> 00:06:18.300
81.
 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.218
I want to show you first its
location, because that itself is

00:06:21.218 --> 00:06:21.899
significant.
 

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:26.509
We are looking at the Google
Earth view of the Roman Forum.

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:28.740
You see the Roman Forum here.
 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.610
You see the Colosseum up at the
top center.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.680
You see the Capitoline Hill or
Campidoglio here;

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.446
the Victor Emmanuel Monument
here--I've pointed these out

00:06:39.446 --> 00:06:43.550
many times before--the Via dei
Fori Imperiali of Mussolini;

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.490
the Imperial Fora to the left;
again the Roman Forum here;

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.774
and the Palatine Hill,
which we're going to be

00:06:50.774 --> 00:06:52.600
concentrating on today.
 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.317
But you'll remember that Nero's
hope was to link the Palatine

00:06:56.317 --> 00:07:00.045
Hill with the Esquiline Hill,
which is right up to the left

00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:03.074
of the Colosseum,
and to do that via a spur

00:07:03.074 --> 00:07:06.920
hill--a spur hill that's located
just right here,

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.480
a bit above my finger--a spur
hill called the Velia,

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.490
V-e-l-i-a, that was to link the
two.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.589
And you'll remember Nero's
plans for his Domus Transitoria,

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:20.377
this palace that was to serve
as a point of transit between

00:07:20.377 --> 00:07:23.548
those two hills,
and you'll recall also the

00:07:23.548 --> 00:07:27.778
remains of some of the rooms
from the Domus Transitoria.

00:07:27.778 --> 00:07:32.050
So this was again land that had
been built up by Nero.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.040
So it's not surprising to see
the Flavians--

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.182
once again Titus following
suit, and then his younger

00:07:38.182 --> 00:07:40.300
brother Domitian following
suit--

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.353
to use land that had earlier
been used by Nero for new

00:07:44.353 --> 00:07:48.404
Flavian monuments,
in this case an arch put up to

00:07:48.404 --> 00:07:52.480
the victory that Titus
celebrated over Jerusalem.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.750
And if you look very carefully,
again just a bit,

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.550
a few inches above where my
finger is,

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:01.209
you will see the Arch of Titus
standing on that spur hill,

00:08:01.209 --> 00:08:05.190
on the Velia,
between the Palatine and the

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.939
Esquiline Hills.
 

00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:10.976
The Arch of Titus,
again which dates to after A.D.

00:08:10.976 --> 00:08:14.519
81, was placed right next to
the Sacred Way,

00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:16.250
or the Via Sacra.
 

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.572
It doesn't span the street,
but it's placed right next to

00:08:19.572 --> 00:08:20.805
it,
adjacent to it,

00:08:20.805 --> 00:08:24.074
and I think you can see that
very well in these two views

00:08:24.074 --> 00:08:26.040
here,
which also show that quite a

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.100
bit of ancient road actually
survives,

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.839
or a piece of ancient road
actually survives,

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:32.620
in the Roman Forum.
 

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.419
It's on the slope that you see
here, and you can see the way in

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:40.037
which it goes right by the Arch
of Titus that you see to its

00:08:40.037 --> 00:08:40.649
right.
 

00:08:40.649 --> 00:08:44.077
This is a view up the hill,
up the Sacred Way,

00:08:44.077 --> 00:08:46.438
toward the Velia,
and here down,

00:08:46.438 --> 00:08:50.095
from the Arch of Titus,
down into the rest of the

00:08:50.095 --> 00:08:51.009
Forum.
 

00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:54.756
And again you can see the
polygonal masonry of the ancient

00:08:54.756 --> 00:08:56.269
road still preserved.
 

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:58.184
The ancient way,
the Via Sacra,

00:08:58.184 --> 00:09:01.504
was the road that the
triumphant general took when he

00:09:01.504 --> 00:09:04.889
returned to Rome,
after a great military victory;

00:09:04.889 --> 00:09:08.551
so this is exactly the road
that Titus himself would've

00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:12.620
taken when he came back from
Judea and walked in triumph,

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.750
or rode in triumph,
in his chariot,

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.269
along the Sacred Way and up to
the Capitoline Hill.

00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:23.466
Because the triumphant general,
who was garbed with the

00:09:23.466 --> 00:09:26.640
attributes of Jupiter,
in this procession,

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.298
made his way up to the
Capitoline Hill,

00:09:29.298 --> 00:09:31.528
would get off his chariot up
there,

00:09:31.528 --> 00:09:34.095
right at the altar,
in front of the Temple of

00:09:34.095 --> 00:09:37.830
Jupiter OMC,
and make a sacrifice to Jupiter.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.480
So you have to imagine Titus
doing this;

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.448
along with Vespasian,
because you'll remember I

00:09:42.448 --> 00:09:44.889
mentioned to you that they
celebrated a joint triumph,

00:09:44.889 --> 00:09:48.543
that Titus was willing to share
his triumph with his father

00:09:48.543 --> 00:09:49.298
Vespasian.
 

00:09:49.298 --> 00:09:52.676
So they both would've come in,
in triumph, into Rome,

00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:54.428
after this great victory.
 

00:09:54.428 --> 00:09:57.408
Once again you can see the arch
in the view on the right.

00:09:57.408 --> 00:10:01.149
Another view of the arch here,
which shows it on the Velia;

00:10:01.149 --> 00:10:03.868
and here you can get a very
good sense of the way in which

00:10:03.868 --> 00:10:06.538
that spur hill unites the
Palatine and the Esquiline,

00:10:06.538 --> 00:10:10.769
as well as the proximity of the
Arch of Titus to the Colosseum.

00:10:10.769 --> 00:10:14.517
We are seeing that the Flavians
are building up a certain area

00:10:14.517 --> 00:10:18.080
of Rome, with their monuments,
and this is no exception.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.620
The view that we see here,
from the Forum,

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.477
of one side of the Arch of
Titus, shows a modern

00:10:24.477 --> 00:10:27.582
inscription,
but we'll see that there is an

00:10:27.582 --> 00:10:30.019
ancient inscription on the other
side.

00:10:30.019 --> 00:10:33.389
And we're also going to see
that although the arch looks

00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:37.063
very well preserved,
it was actually quite heavily

00:10:37.063 --> 00:10:41.750
restored by an architect by the
name of Giuseppe Valadier,

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.481
and that happened in the
nineteenth century that

00:10:44.481 --> 00:10:46.639
Valadier--
V-a-l-a-d-i-e-r;

00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:49.918
Giuseppe Valadier--restored the
Arch of Titus.

00:10:49.918 --> 00:10:54.470
And the part of the arch that
is ancient is essentially the

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:58.157
central section,
right here--mostly on the other

00:10:58.157 --> 00:11:01.383
side actually;
on this side just the spandrels

00:11:01.383 --> 00:11:04.484
and the inner panels here,
and on the other side we'll

00:11:04.484 --> 00:11:07.820
see--well I'll show you when we
get to the other side.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.736
So this side important to know
that the inscription is a modern

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:11.019
one.
 

00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:14.586
Here's the other side of the
arch, where you can see again

00:11:14.586 --> 00:11:17.716
the central section is ancient,
with the spandrels,

00:11:17.716 --> 00:11:21.816
these triangular areas here;
the columns on this side are

00:11:21.816 --> 00:11:23.928
ancient;
the keystone is ancient;

00:11:23.928 --> 00:11:27.889
the frieze up above the
keystone is ancient;

00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:29.960
the inscription is ancient on
this side.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.351
But all the rest was restored
by Valadier, as I said in the

00:11:33.351 --> 00:11:34.580
nineteenth century.
 

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.750
And Valadier did something very
interesting,

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:40.960
and archaeologically very
forward thinking,

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.205
in that since the center of the
arch was made out of Greek

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:47.943
marble,
pentelic marble--p-e-n-t-

00:11:47.943 --> 00:11:52.649
e-l-i-c--pentelic marble from
Mount Pentelikon in Greece--

00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:56.113
which in itself is interesting
because we saw that the Flavians

00:11:56.113 --> 00:11:58.850
were using imported marbles in
their buildings;

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:02.009
I've mentioned that already
before.

00:12:02.009 --> 00:12:04.600
So we see a continuation of
that trend here,

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.889
use of pentelic marble for the
arch.

00:12:06.889 --> 00:12:09.620
But when Valadier did the
restorations,

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.035
or the reconstruction,
he used travertine for the

00:12:13.035 --> 00:12:16.326
modern parts of the arch,
so that when you--it probably

00:12:16.326 --> 00:12:18.158
isn't so evident to you from
this view,

00:12:18.158 --> 00:12:21.565
but when you stand in front of
the arch you can see the

00:12:21.565 --> 00:12:24.952
difference in the materials,
and he wanted to point out to

00:12:24.952 --> 00:12:27.916
the spectator that there was a
difference between the ancient

00:12:27.916 --> 00:12:30.929
part of the monument and the
modern part of the monument,

00:12:30.929 --> 00:12:33.940
as restored by him.
 

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.150
This view on the left,
there are quite a number of

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.557
preserved paintings and
engravings that show the arch

00:12:40.557 --> 00:12:43.178
before the Valadier
reconstruction,

00:12:43.178 --> 00:12:44.940
and you see one of those over
there.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.566
And you can see we're looking
at the same side of the arch

00:12:47.566 --> 00:12:48.580
here as we are here.
 

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.567
So once again you can see the
ancient -- what survived of the

00:12:52.567 --> 00:12:54.759
ancient arch:
the central part;

00:12:54.759 --> 00:12:58.269
the two columns on bases;
the keystone;

00:12:58.269 --> 00:13:01.740
the spandrels;
the frieze;

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.830
and then the inscription.
 

00:13:13.399 --> 00:13:16.000
So, and we see that here.
 

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.086
And this is another one of
those Roman monuments that was

00:13:19.086 --> 00:13:22.009
essentially preserved because of
re-use over time,

00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:24.610
or at least the part of it that
still exists.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.428
And this was turned into,
as so many other monuments,

00:13:27.428 --> 00:13:30.519
was turned into a fortress at
one point,

00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:34.250
a fortress that was owned by
the Frangipani family in Italy.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:37.879
So that's the ancient part;
the rest restored by Valadier.

00:13:37.879 --> 00:13:41.155
And you have to also
reconstruct in your mind's eye

00:13:41.155 --> 00:13:45.089
that this arch would've served
as a kind of statue base for a

00:13:45.089 --> 00:13:48.466
representation,
or for a sculptural group,

00:13:48.466 --> 00:13:51.160
in bronze,
that would've represented

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.668
Titus, and perhaps Vespasian
also,

00:13:53.668 --> 00:13:57.950
together, seated in a chariot,
being led by four horses,

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:02.711
a great quadriga group that was
customarily placed on the top of

00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:03.769
such arches.
 

00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:05.866
Below that the inscription
plaque, below that,

00:14:05.866 --> 00:14:08.524
as I've already described,
a frieze--I'm going to show you

00:14:08.524 --> 00:14:09.830
that frieze in a moment.
 

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.839
Then the spandrels,
and then in the center here,

00:14:12.839 --> 00:14:15.336
two great panels,
one on either--figural

00:14:15.336 --> 00:14:18.090
panels--one on either side of
the arch.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:19.769
You see the inscription here.
 

00:14:19.769 --> 00:14:22.902
It's interesting because it
tells us that it was the Senate

00:14:22.902 --> 00:14:26.145
and People of Rome,
the SPQR, the Senate and People

00:14:26.145 --> 00:14:29.772
of Rome,
who put this up to the Divine

00:14:29.772 --> 00:14:31.740
Titus,
Divo Tito,

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.933
as you can see here,
and--the Divine Titus,

00:14:34.933 --> 00:14:37.754
who was the son--
there's an F for filius

00:14:37.754 --> 00:14:41.269
right over here--
the son of the Divine Vespasian.

00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:44.535
So the divinity of both of
these men, both of whom were

00:14:44.535 --> 00:14:47.379
made gods at their death,
is alluded to here.

00:14:47.379 --> 00:14:51.549
So the Senate and People of
Rome put this up to the Divine

00:14:51.549 --> 00:14:54.548
Titus, the son of the Divine
Vespasian.

00:14:54.548 --> 00:14:58.245
And you can see all of these
little holes that are located in

00:14:58.245 --> 00:14:59.600
some of the letters.
 

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.589
The reason for those is that
those were where bronze letters

00:15:03.589 --> 00:15:05.278
were actually attached.
 

00:15:05.278 --> 00:15:08.950
So these letters were inscribed
and then bronze letters were

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:12.558
attached to them so that the
inscription would gleam in the

00:15:12.558 --> 00:15:15.875
sunshine,
and so that you could see it

00:15:15.875 --> 00:15:18.320
from considerable distance.
 

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.090
Down below the inscription
plaque we see the frieze,

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:25.595
which purports to represent
this great procession or parade

00:15:25.595 --> 00:15:29.788
that took place when Titus
returned from Jerusalem,

00:15:29.788 --> 00:15:33.620
and had his triumphal
procession along the Sacred Way,

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.629
and up to the Capitoline Hill
and the Temple of Jupiter.

00:15:37.629 --> 00:15:41.923
And you can see that the artist
has made the figures fairly

00:15:41.923 --> 00:15:44.514
small,
but at the same time has made

00:15:44.514 --> 00:15:46.840
each one distinct from the
other,

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:51.029
so that this is more readable
from the ground.

00:15:51.029 --> 00:15:54.009
And then below that,
the decoration of the keystone.

00:15:54.009 --> 00:15:56.428
And then in either spandrel,
or triangular area at either

00:15:56.428 --> 00:15:58.634
side of the keystones,
we see victories,

00:15:58.634 --> 00:16:00.950
flying female figures of
victory,

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:03.009
that are of course making
reference,

00:16:03.009 --> 00:16:06.517
in a general way,
to this great victory that

00:16:06.517 --> 00:16:08.720
Titus had over Jerusalem.
 

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.809
Important from the
architectural standpoint are the

00:16:11.809 --> 00:16:14.158
columns and especially the
capitals.

00:16:14.158 --> 00:16:19.000
I show you a detail of one of
the preserved--

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.128
there are two again--but one of
the two preserved capitals from

00:16:22.128 --> 00:16:25.859
this side of the arch,
the side that faces the

00:16:25.859 --> 00:16:27.038
Colosseum.
 

00:16:27.038 --> 00:16:29.193
And you see it here,
and it's a distinctive capital

00:16:29.193 --> 00:16:30.528
that we have not seen before.
 

00:16:30.528 --> 00:16:35.345
It's a capital that actually
combines the Corinthian and the

00:16:35.345 --> 00:16:37.803
Ionic,
because you can see the

00:16:37.803 --> 00:16:40.950
Corinthian acanthus leaves
growing up here:

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:43.427
flowers,
as we see, in the usual

00:16:43.427 --> 00:16:47.250
Corinthian order,
and then prominent volutes of

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.509
the Ionic order up above.
 

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:52.548
We refer to this as the
composite capital;

00:16:52.548 --> 00:16:56.129
the composite capital,
combining Corinthian and Ionic.

00:16:56.129 --> 00:16:59.327
We see it quite infrequently in
Roman architecture,

00:16:59.327 --> 00:17:01.308
but we do see it on occasion.
 

00:17:01.308 --> 00:17:06.038
So it's good for you to know
about.

00:17:06.038 --> 00:17:07.919
In the center of the bay I
mentioned that there were two

00:17:07.919 --> 00:17:11.384
great figural panels,
and these figural panels make

00:17:11.384 --> 00:17:15.490
reference to Titus' victory over
Jerusalem,

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.229
to this important event,
from the point of view of the

00:17:18.229 --> 00:17:20.190
Flavians,
that gave their dynasty

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:20.890
legitimacy.
 

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.730
And we see one of those here.
 

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.619
We actually see an image of
Titus in his chariot,

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:28.269
and he's riding alone,
without his father.

00:17:28.269 --> 00:17:31.884
He's riding alone in his
chariot, with the exception of a

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:34.210
female figure who accompanies
him.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:37.420
And you can see that female
figure is winged,

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.880
and she is a personification of
victory--

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.868
so she is heralding the victory
that he has had in Jerusalem--

00:17:43.868 --> 00:17:46.659
and, in fact,
she holds a laurel wreath above

00:17:46.659 --> 00:17:48.169
his head,
crowning him,

00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:49.608
because of that victory.
 

00:17:49.608 --> 00:17:52.190
The chariot is led by four
horses,

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:54.519
who are whizzing by,
as you can see here,

00:17:54.519 --> 00:17:56.651
and they are led,
at the front,

00:17:56.651 --> 00:17:59.990
by a woman in a helmet and
military costume,

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:03.373
who might well be Roma,
the personification of Rome

00:18:03.373 --> 00:18:04.049
herself.
 

00:18:04.049 --> 00:18:05.308
And what is she doing?
 

00:18:05.308 --> 00:18:10.506
She's welcoming Titus back to
Rome, after his great victory

00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:12.028
over Jerusalem.
 

00:18:12.028 --> 00:18:15.400
Over here, two other figures,
two other male figures,

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.910
both headless today,
but one of them in a toga,

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.516
and the other figure with a
bare chest and a mantle wrapped

00:18:22.516 --> 00:18:24.630
over the lower part of his body.
 

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.568
Because we have the same
figures in other reliefs,

00:18:27.568 --> 00:18:30.450
we know, despite the fact that
they are headless,

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.450
that these are personifications
of the Senate.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.470
The dressed person,
the person in toga,

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:38.548
is the Senate,
the Genius--g-e-n-i-u-s,

00:18:38.548 --> 00:18:40.470
like genius--the Genius
Senatus,

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:41.788
or the Spirit of the Senate.
 

00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:45.686
And this, the Genius Populi
Romani, which was the

00:18:45.686 --> 00:18:48.308
representative of the Roman
People.

00:18:48.308 --> 00:18:51.864
So keep in mind again,
it was the Senate and People of

00:18:51.864 --> 00:18:55.619
Rome that put up the arch to
Titus, the son of the divine

00:18:55.619 --> 00:18:58.182
Vespasian;
and we see themselves,

00:18:58.182 --> 00:19:02.170
or their personifications,
represented in this scene.

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:03.769
More interesting from our
standpoint,

00:19:03.769 --> 00:19:06.548
vis-à-vis architecture,
is the other scene,

00:19:06.548 --> 00:19:08.910
on the other side of the
central bay,

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:13.126
where we see the Roman
soldiers, or a group of Roman

00:19:13.126 --> 00:19:16.240
soldiers,
bringing back spoils or booty,

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.050
trophies,
from Jerusalem,

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:22.108
things that they have stolen
from the temple in Jerusalem.

00:19:22.108 --> 00:19:26.016
And you can see the famous
seven-branched candelabrum that

00:19:26.016 --> 00:19:27.730
they are carrying here.
 

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:32.179
The weight is so great that
their shoulders bend under that

00:19:32.179 --> 00:19:32.868
weight.
 

00:19:32.868 --> 00:19:36.433
And we also see them with a
table over here that has a

00:19:36.433 --> 00:19:40.670
number of sacrificial implements
and so on, that were taken also

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.890
from the Temple in Jerusalem.
 

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.390
So they carry these along in
this parade,

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:49.519
for the people to see,
for those in Rome to see,

00:19:49.519 --> 00:19:53.223
to get a real palpable sense of
what it meant to have this

00:19:53.223 --> 00:19:55.143
victory,
and of the spoils that are

00:19:55.143 --> 00:19:56.068
being brought back.
 

00:19:56.068 --> 00:19:58.387
And you can see that--this is
represented very

00:19:58.387 --> 00:20:01.516
illusionistically--
and you can see that they seem

00:20:01.516 --> 00:20:05.880
to be walking through an arch,
that is also represented here:

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.278
a very interesting scene
indeed.

00:20:08.278 --> 00:20:11.470
And you'll recall what they did
with those spoils.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.915
They took those spoils and they
put them in the Templum Pacis

00:20:14.915 --> 00:20:18.107
that we talked about last time,
or the Forum Pacis that we

00:20:18.107 --> 00:20:21.451
talked about last time,
that served essentially as a

00:20:21.451 --> 00:20:26.368
kind of museum where the people
of Rome could see these images.

00:20:26.368 --> 00:20:29.920
So once again the Flavians
always showing an affinity for,

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.038
and an interest in,
the people of the city --

00:20:33.038 --> 00:20:35.349
the people of the city that
they were trying,

00:20:35.349 --> 00:20:37.009
of course, to court favor from.
 

00:20:37.009 --> 00:20:40.338
So we're seeing Domitian,
who again was the commissioner

00:20:40.338 --> 00:20:43.873
of this monument,
continuing on in the same vein

00:20:43.873 --> 00:20:48.279
as Vespasian and Titus,
honoring this victory that gave

00:20:48.279 --> 00:20:51.150
legitimacy to the Flavian
dynasty,

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:55.404
but also always acknowledging
and thinking of the impact that

00:20:55.404 --> 00:20:59.519
it's going to have on the Senate
and the People of Rome.

00:20:59.519 --> 00:21:03.068
The central bay,
if you stand right below it and

00:21:03.068 --> 00:21:06.185
look up,
you will see the vault of the

00:21:06.185 --> 00:21:09.799
interior of the arch,
and you can see that it has a

00:21:09.799 --> 00:21:12.633
coffered ceiling,
as we've seen so often in Roman

00:21:12.633 --> 00:21:14.618
monuments;
quite well preserved,

00:21:14.618 --> 00:21:18.220
with the coffers and then the
rosettes in the center.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.897
And if I show you another
detail of that,

00:21:20.897 --> 00:21:24.915
you'll get an even better sense
of it, and also of how ornate

00:21:24.915 --> 00:21:26.390
the decoration is.
 

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:29.088
We've talked about the fact
that the Flavians had a

00:21:29.088 --> 00:21:31.518
particular interest in very
ornate decoration,

00:21:31.518 --> 00:21:33.568
and you can see that as well
here.

00:21:33.568 --> 00:21:37.500
In fact, the drill has been
used so extensively that it

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.633
almost dematerializes the vault,
I think, in a very interesting

00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:44.275
way,
creating a kind of overall

00:21:44.275 --> 00:21:46.779
tapestry of dark and light.
 

00:21:46.779 --> 00:21:50.450
And then in the center a panel
that is surrounded by a garland,

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.680
and in the center of that panel
a depiction--

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.858
you can probably barely see it
from where you sit--

00:21:55.858 --> 00:22:00.556
but a depiction of Titus being
carried to heaven on the back of

00:22:00.556 --> 00:22:01.390
an eagle.
 

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:04.980
In this case Titus is not in
military dress but in a toga.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.593
He's on the back of an eagle,
with outstretched wings,

00:22:07.593 --> 00:22:10.009
and that eagle is taking him up
to the heavens.

00:22:10.009 --> 00:22:12.494
What this is,
is a representation of

00:22:12.494 --> 00:22:15.180
apotheosis--
a-p-o-t-h-e-o-s-

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.560
i-s--apotheosis,
or divinization:

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:22.037
the divinization--
because the Romans believed

00:22:22.037 --> 00:22:23.900
that they could make humans into
gods,

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:28.384
after their death--the making
of Titus into a god after his

00:22:28.384 --> 00:22:30.614
death,
and the depiction of--the

00:22:30.614 --> 00:22:34.111
material depiction of him
actually being carried to heaven

00:22:34.111 --> 00:22:37.058
on the back of an eagle,
a very powerful image.

00:22:37.058 --> 00:22:42.285
And the fact that it is in the
archivolt of this vault here has

00:22:42.285 --> 00:22:47.258
led scholars to suggest that it
is possible that the Arch of

00:22:47.258 --> 00:22:50.630
Titus in Rome served as Titus'
tomb.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.165
And that seems to be
corroborated by the fact that

00:22:54.165 --> 00:22:58.490
behind the attic,
or inside the attic of the

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:02.218
arch, is a staircase,
as well as a chamber,

00:23:02.218 --> 00:23:05.586
and I show both of them to you
here: a spiral staircase and a

00:23:05.586 --> 00:23:08.397
chamber,
a chamber that might well have

00:23:08.397 --> 00:23:11.818
served as a burial chamber for
an urn of Titus.

00:23:11.818 --> 00:23:14.711
The urn was never found--was
not found in the excavation of

00:23:14.711 --> 00:23:17.647
this monument,
so we can't prove this,

00:23:17.647 --> 00:23:23.189
but I think it's very possible
that this arch served as a tomb

00:23:23.189 --> 00:23:25.460
for the emperor Titus.
 

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:30.068
Titus was succeeded,
as I've already mentioned,

00:23:30.068 --> 00:23:32.976
by his younger brother
Domitian, whom you see in two

00:23:32.976 --> 00:23:35.368
portraits here:
a portrait from Munich,

00:23:35.368 --> 00:23:37.358
on the left,
in military garb,

00:23:37.358 --> 00:23:40.308
and then a bust-length portrait
in Rome,

00:23:40.308 --> 00:23:42.950
on the right-hand side of the
screen.

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:46.460
Domitian was born in A.D. 51.
 

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.970
So he was only your age,
about nineteen,

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.660
when Titus went off to the
Jewish Wars.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:57.507
There was never any question
that Domitian would succeed his

00:23:57.507 --> 00:23:58.160
brother.
 

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.230
Vespasian was in this for the
long haul.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:03.008
He created a dynasty and
expected both of his sons,

00:24:03.008 --> 00:24:04.452
first Titus,
his older son,

00:24:04.452 --> 00:24:07.509
and then his younger son,
Domitian, to succeed him.

00:24:07.509 --> 00:24:11.009
So Domitian's eventual rise to
power was never in question.

00:24:11.009 --> 00:24:14.058
And yet Domitian was jealous of
his brother,

00:24:14.058 --> 00:24:16.680
who was very popular in Rome,
as I've already mentioned,

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.777
and who had this great military
victory on which the Flavians

00:24:20.777 --> 00:24:22.690
based their claim to rule.
 

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.180
And Domitian was very jealous
of his brother.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:29.634
He felt out of the loop,
and so when he succeeded

00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:31.761
Titus--
quicker than he thought,

00:24:31.761 --> 00:24:33.970
because Titus died way before
his time,

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:35.890
in his thirties,
as you know--when Domitian

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:38.712
succeeded Titus,
he came to power as a very

00:24:38.712 --> 00:24:41.960
embittered man,
and he never got over that

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:42.868
bitterness.
 

00:24:42.868 --> 00:24:46.113
And, in fact,
what we see Domitian doing is

00:24:46.113 --> 00:24:50.204
really reverting to the
megalomaniacal way of thinking

00:24:50.204 --> 00:24:53.140
of people like Caligula and
Nero,

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:58.240
exercising his imperial
prerogatives to the fullest and,

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:04.609
in fact, even insisting that he
be addressed as "lord and

00:25:04.609 --> 00:25:08.368
god," dominus et
deus;

00:25:08.368 --> 00:25:10.775
which I've put on your Monument
List for you,

00:25:10.775 --> 00:25:13.288
dominus et deus,
that's lord and god.

00:25:13.288 --> 00:25:15.798
And he, not surprisingly,
given his bent,

00:25:15.798 --> 00:25:19.901
he not surprisingly moved away
from the public architecture

00:25:19.901 --> 00:25:22.730
that Vespasian and Titus had
favored--

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.994
for Vespasian,
of course, buildings like the

00:25:24.994 --> 00:25:27.096
Colosseum,
for Titus, the Baths of

00:25:27.096 --> 00:25:30.667
Titus--the public architecture
that had been favored by his

00:25:30.667 --> 00:25:32.269
father and his brother.
 

00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:36.011
He moved back to being
interested in building palatial

00:25:36.011 --> 00:25:39.190
architecture,
essentially to his own glory.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:42.439
And we're going to see that the
major monument that he

00:25:42.439 --> 00:25:46.180
commissioned was the Imperial
Palace on the Palatine Hill,

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.538
that had been begun by Tiberius
and Caligula;

00:25:49.538 --> 00:25:53.838
he completed that palace in the
nineties A.D.

00:25:53.838 --> 00:25:56.406
Before we get to that,
which will be our main focus

00:25:56.406 --> 00:25:58.132
today,
I would like--because it's

00:25:58.132 --> 00:25:59.930
extensive and there's a lot to
see--

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:05.324
I would like to say a few words
about another commission of

00:26:05.324 --> 00:26:08.067
Domitian,
because he wasn't without the

00:26:08.067 --> 00:26:10.818
desire to at least build some
public buildings,

00:26:10.818 --> 00:26:13.348
and I'd like to begin with one
of those here.

00:26:13.348 --> 00:26:18.507
This is a model of the
so-called Stadium of Domitian,

00:26:18.507 --> 00:26:23.366
a stadium or a race course,
that was put up during

00:26:23.366 --> 00:26:27.502
Domitian's reign;
we date it usually to the

00:26:27.502 --> 00:26:30.788
latter part of his reign,
92 to 96 A.D.

00:26:30.788 --> 00:26:33.519
And you see that model again
here.

00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:38.409
And you can tell a lot about
this building from both the

00:26:38.409 --> 00:26:41.945
scanty remains,
but also from other evidence

00:26:41.945 --> 00:26:45.611
that allows us to be able to
reconstruct it relatively

00:26:45.611 --> 00:26:46.579
accurately.
 

00:26:46.579 --> 00:26:47.828
You see it here.
 

00:26:47.828 --> 00:26:51.390
These stadia were hairpin in
shape--

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:53.759
as you can see,
a straight end on one side,

00:26:53.759 --> 00:26:56.970
a curved end on the other--but
long,

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:01.630
elongated, a kind of elongated
oval with one straight side,

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.318
as you can see.
 

00:27:03.318 --> 00:27:05.978
It was put up in very similar
fashion to theaters and to

00:27:05.978 --> 00:27:09.317
amphitheaters,
in that they built a concrete

00:27:09.317 --> 00:27:13.920
hill and lined that concrete
hill with stone seats,

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.078
and then buttressed it with a
wall,

00:27:16.078 --> 00:27:18.778
as you can see here,
that was decorated,

00:27:18.778 --> 00:27:20.348
just like the Theater of
Marcellus,

00:27:20.348 --> 00:27:23.653
or like the Colosseum,
with in this case two tiers of

00:27:23.653 --> 00:27:25.712
arches,
two sets of arcades,

00:27:25.712 --> 00:27:29.698
with columns in between them,
those columns again having no

00:27:29.698 --> 00:27:34.208
structural purpose whatsoever,
just used as decoration for the

00:27:34.208 --> 00:27:35.029
monument.
 

00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:37.797
And then the exits and
entrances, again done very

00:27:37.797 --> 00:27:40.622
similarly to amphitheater or
theater architecture,

00:27:40.622 --> 00:27:42.640
as we've discussed it thus far.
 

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.461
So the main difference is it's
not quite as tall as

00:27:45.461 --> 00:27:46.930
amphitheaters,
for example,

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:49.301
or theaters,
and just two tiers of columns,

00:27:49.301 --> 00:27:50.769
as you can see here.
 

00:27:50.769 --> 00:27:56.083
And the main difference in plan
is that it's a hairpin shape,

00:27:56.083 --> 00:28:00.598
again with one straight side
and one curved side.

00:28:00.598 --> 00:28:03.455
Only a small--one can see
today, and this is essentially

00:28:03.455 --> 00:28:06.210
underground or what survives of
it is underground,

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:09.359
although there's one section
that can still be seen,

00:28:09.359 --> 00:28:12.009
as I'll show you in a moment.
 

00:28:12.009 --> 00:28:15.313
But what's absolutely
miraculous is the fact that the

00:28:15.313 --> 00:28:18.425
actual hairpin shape of the
Stadium of Domitian is

00:28:18.425 --> 00:28:20.544
preserved,
in its entirety,

00:28:20.544 --> 00:28:24.328
in the shape of one of Rome's
most famous piazzas,

00:28:24.328 --> 00:28:27.230
and my favorite,
by far, the Piazza Navona,

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.828
which you see from the air
here, in a Google Earth image.

00:28:30.828 --> 00:28:36.353
And you can see again the exact
shape: the straight side and the

00:28:36.353 --> 00:28:41.349
curved side, of Domitian's
Stadium, still preserved in the

00:28:41.349 --> 00:28:43.630
Piazza Navona in Rome.
 

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:45.720
It's a wonderful piazza.
 

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.663
For those of you who've been
there, I'm sure you have enjoyed

00:28:49.663 --> 00:28:51.108
spending time there.
 

00:28:51.108 --> 00:28:54.273
For those of you haven't,
it really is a mecca within

00:28:54.273 --> 00:28:54.700
Rome.
 

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.107
And you can see not only is it
a pleasant place to walk but

00:28:58.107 --> 00:29:00.400
also a place to see great
buildings,

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.801
for example,
Francesco Borromini's

00:29:02.801 --> 00:29:06.433
Sant'Agnese in Agone,
and Bernini's Four Rivers,

00:29:06.433 --> 00:29:10.362
famous Four Rivers Fountain,
in the center of the piazza,

00:29:10.362 --> 00:29:12.240
in dialogue with one another.
 

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.380
And as we look at this from the
air,

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.608
and we look at the curved end
of the Piazza Navona,

00:29:18.608 --> 00:29:22.255
you can see there's one street
that you can take out of that

00:29:22.255 --> 00:29:24.430
curved end,
one small street.

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:27.066
If you take a left,
and then a left again,

00:29:27.066 --> 00:29:30.538
you will see the remains of the
Stadium of Domitian;

00:29:30.538 --> 00:29:32.318
I'm going to show those to you
in a moment.

00:29:32.318 --> 00:29:35.009
And if you stay in the center
of the piazza,

00:29:35.009 --> 00:29:37.855
near the Four Rivers Fountain,
and you go sort of diagonally

00:29:37.855 --> 00:29:41.077
across from that,
you will end up at one of the

00:29:41.077 --> 00:29:43.880
four best ice cream places in
Rome;

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.470
you can get some of the best
gelato in Rome.

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:48.932
You can get good gelato almost
anywhere in Rome,

00:29:48.932 --> 00:29:50.557
and in Italy,
but the very best,

00:29:50.557 --> 00:29:53.728
this is one of those four;
I'll say something more about

00:29:53.728 --> 00:29:54.720
that in a moment.
 

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:58.801
Here are the remains of the
Stadium of Domitian that can

00:29:58.801 --> 00:29:59.990
still be seen.
 

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:03.440
Very few tourists notice this,
but it's well worth looking at,

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.868
because you can see the
brick-faced cement construction

00:30:06.868 --> 00:30:09.913
that served for the--
that was how the substructures

00:30:09.913 --> 00:30:12.743
of this building were built--
and I think you can even see

00:30:12.743 --> 00:30:15.198
that from a distance here--
made out of concrete,

00:30:15.198 --> 00:30:18.084
faced with brick --
but the arcades and the

00:30:18.084 --> 00:30:20.798
columns, that I showed you
before,

00:30:20.798 --> 00:30:24.490
out of travertine,
ashlar masonry travertine,

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:28.773
which was one of the last
buildings actually in Rome to be

00:30:28.773 --> 00:30:31.480
made of travertine ashlar
masonry.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:35.655
Just to show you also that
again--just as when we were in

00:30:35.655 --> 00:30:38.490
Capri I showed you the Bar
Tiberio,

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:41.606
and its reference to
Tiberius--it's amazing what

00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:44.990
those who put up restaurants and
bars and so on,

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:48.142
around Rome,
it's amazing--it demonstrates

00:30:48.142 --> 00:30:51.910
the strong sense of history that
Italians have.

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:56.439
Because just the fact that they
recognize that these are remains

00:30:56.439 --> 00:30:59.638
from the Stadium of Domitian--
everyone thinks of this

00:30:59.638 --> 00:31:02.694
structure as the Piazza Navona--
but the fact that they are well

00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:05.598
aware of the fact that it was
Domitian's Stadium,

00:31:05.598 --> 00:31:07.038
so that the wine bar across the
street--

00:31:07.038 --> 00:31:09.096
and this is one that was just
opened the last couple of

00:31:09.096 --> 00:31:11.544
years--
the wine bar across the street

00:31:11.544 --> 00:31:14.420
is called the Domiziano:
the Domiziano,

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.702
after Domitian,
because it's right across the

00:31:17.702 --> 00:31:20.538
street from the Stadium of
Domitian.

00:31:20.538 --> 00:31:23.517
With regard to ice cream--I
take my gelato seriously,

00:31:23.517 --> 00:31:27.240
and I'm sure all of you who've
been to Italy feel the same way.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.661
It's not like American ice
cream--not that American ice

00:31:30.661 --> 00:31:33.828
cream isn't good--but it's
absolutely fantastic.

00:31:33.828 --> 00:31:37.279
And so I will make some
recommendations this semester.

00:31:37.279 --> 00:31:40.140
And this is the first one that
I'm going to make,

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.535
because it's one of my
favorites, and everyone agrees

00:31:42.535 --> 00:31:44.930
this is one of the best ice
cream parlors in Rome.

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:46.009
It's called Tre Scalini.
 

00:31:46.009 --> 00:31:49.410
It's also a restaurant,
a restaurant you can pass on.

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:52.490
Like so many restaurants in the
center of famous piazzas,

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:55.279
it's not the best,
but--and you don't have to sit

00:31:55.279 --> 00:31:57.056
outside,
although they will try to

00:31:57.056 --> 00:31:59.556
beckon you to sit outside,
because it costs more to eat

00:31:59.556 --> 00:32:02.140
the ice cream outside than it
does if you just walk into--

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:05.190
walk through the door--there
are actually two doors,

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:06.278
one on that side,
one on this side--

00:32:06.278 --> 00:32:09.000
go right up to the counter,
take a look at what's there,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.920
and make your order.
 

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:15.771
And my recommendation for this
particular gelateria is the

00:32:15.771 --> 00:32:18.328
tartufi;
they are very famous.

00:32:18.328 --> 00:32:21.313
This is the best tartufo
in Rome, without question,

00:32:21.313 --> 00:32:22.568
if you like chocolate.
 

00:32:22.568 --> 00:32:25.788
It's a chocolate bomb
essentially, as you can see in

00:32:25.788 --> 00:32:27.048
these images here.
 

00:32:27.048 --> 00:32:31.064
It is one big,
well fairly large,

00:32:31.064 --> 00:32:35.782
very rich chocolate,
with big, the biggest chocolate

00:32:35.782 --> 00:32:38.563
chips you ever saw on it,
and then they put a dollop--I

00:32:38.563 --> 00:32:41.598
don't even like whipped cream,
but when it's panna on

00:32:41.598 --> 00:32:44.618
top of the tartufo,
I go the whole way.

00:32:44.618 --> 00:32:47.558
So you have the panna on
top of the tartufo.

00:32:47.558 --> 00:32:50.198
And if you sit outside and are
willing to pay extra,

00:32:50.198 --> 00:32:52.009
they'll throw a pirouette on
top;

00:32:52.009 --> 00:32:54.240
if not, you have to forego the
pirouette.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.737
But I really highly--whether
you like chocolate or you don't

00:32:56.737 --> 00:32:59.763
like chocolate--
I've gone with people who are

00:32:59.763 --> 00:33:03.930
not the kind of chocoholic I am,
who like this anyway.

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:07.253
So it's really a treat,
and at least once when you're

00:33:07.253 --> 00:33:11.410
in Rome you have to indulge in a
tartufo at Tre Scalini.

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:15.661
I want to move from Domitian's
Stadium to the building that

00:33:15.661 --> 00:33:18.519
we're going to concentrate on
today,

00:33:18.519 --> 00:33:21.910
because again it is so
extensive, and that is

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:25.068
Domitian's Palace on the
Palatine Hill.

00:33:25.068 --> 00:33:28.170
We usually refer to it as
Domitian's Palace on the

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:30.891
Palatine Hill,
or the Imperial Palace on the

00:33:30.891 --> 00:33:32.028
Palatine Hill.
 

00:33:32.028 --> 00:33:36.739
But the nomenclature is
complex, because in antiquity it

00:33:36.739 --> 00:33:42.535
was referred to as the Domus,
the Domus Augustana--like the

00:33:42.535 --> 00:33:45.034
Domus Aurea,
the Golden House of Nero--the

00:33:45.034 --> 00:33:46.269
Domus Augustana:
Augustus' House,

00:33:46.269 --> 00:33:47.460
essentially.
 

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.765
Because by this point the word
Augustus had become

00:33:50.765 --> 00:33:54.015
synonymous with emperor;
so every emperor was the

00:33:54.015 --> 00:33:54.730
Augustus.
 

00:33:54.730 --> 00:34:00.380
So this is the Domus Augustana,
which again continues

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:02.009
construction.
 

00:34:02.009 --> 00:34:05.039
We talked about the fact that
Tiberius had begun a palace on

00:34:05.039 --> 00:34:07.403
the Palatine Hill,
on the slope of the Palatine

00:34:07.403 --> 00:34:09.510
Hill that Caligula had added to
that.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:12.007
His successors:
Claudius was not that

00:34:12.007 --> 00:34:14.434
interested in palatial
architecture,

00:34:14.434 --> 00:34:18.083
as you'll remember;
Nero had other plans for the

00:34:18.083 --> 00:34:21.309
Domus Transitoria,
and for the Domus Aurea.

00:34:21.309 --> 00:34:24.599
So it was left to the Flavians,
specifically to Domitian,

00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:28.679
to complete the Imperial
Palace, which he does,

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:32.400
and then it is dedicated,
as you can see from the

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.027
monument list,
in A.D.

00:34:34.027 --> 00:34:34.570
92.
 

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:39.505
We also know the architect of
the Domus Augustana,

00:34:39.505 --> 00:34:45.750
and that was a man by the name
of Rabirius, R-a-b-i-r-i-u-s;

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:48.913
a very important Roman
architect by the name of

00:34:48.913 --> 00:34:49.670
Rabirius.
 

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.768
To get back to the nomenclature
for a moment.

00:34:51.768 --> 00:34:55.710
So the actual name of the
palace was the Domus Augustana.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:35:00.010
But here's where it gets
complicated.

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:03.275
There's also a public wing of
the house and a private wing of

00:35:03.275 --> 00:35:03.929
the house.
 

00:35:03.929 --> 00:35:07.414
The public wing--and you can
see it in this Google Earth

00:35:07.414 --> 00:35:10.521
image from the air--
the public wing is on one

00:35:10.521 --> 00:35:12.920
story--and we see that over
here--

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:16.485
and that was referred to in
ancient times as the Flavian

00:35:16.485 --> 00:35:18.541
House,
the Domus Flavia,

00:35:18.541 --> 00:35:20.099
the Domus Flavia.
 

00:35:20.099 --> 00:35:25.583
The private wing was on two
stories, or part of it was on

00:35:25.583 --> 00:35:29.010
two stories--you can see it
here;

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:32.237
it's even larger,
more extensive--and that was

00:35:32.237 --> 00:35:36.039
called, in ancient times,
also the Domus Augustana.

00:35:36.039 --> 00:35:37.927
So this word,
the Domus Augustana,

00:35:37.927 --> 00:35:41.188
referred both to the private
wing, as opposed to the Domus

00:35:41.188 --> 00:35:43.820
Flavia, but also to the palace
as a whole.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.097
So I just wanted you to be
aware of that,

00:35:46.097 --> 00:35:49.342
because as you do your reading
in the textbooks and so on,

00:35:49.342 --> 00:35:52.018
you might find that a little
bit confusing.

00:35:52.018 --> 00:35:54.362
But we can simplify it
completely and just call it the

00:35:54.362 --> 00:35:56.085
Palace of Domitian on the
Palatine Hill,

00:35:56.085 --> 00:35:57.590
which is what I suggest we do.
 

00:35:57.590 --> 00:36:02.237
So once again we can see quite
good , in this view from the

00:36:02.237 --> 00:36:06.887
air, the way in which this
Domitianic structure was planned

00:36:06.887 --> 00:36:08.010
and built.
 

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:10.855
We see over here,
for example--and I'm going to

00:36:10.855 --> 00:36:13.516
show you these in plan,
and also the remains

00:36:13.516 --> 00:36:17.289
shortly--we can see on the upper
left what is a basilica;

00:36:17.289 --> 00:36:21.771
next to that an audience hall;
a great fountain court over

00:36:21.771 --> 00:36:23.931
here;
a triclinium or dining

00:36:23.931 --> 00:36:27.320
room over here;
and then fountains on other

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:32.565
side that belong to the Domus
Flavia or the public section of

00:36:32.565 --> 00:36:33.789
the palace.
 

00:36:33.789 --> 00:36:36.010
And then over here the private
area,

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:37.867
as I said larger,
on two stories,

00:36:37.867 --> 00:36:40.635
right here,
with a court in the center and

00:36:40.635 --> 00:36:43.699
a whole host of small rooms
surrounding that,

00:36:43.699 --> 00:36:46.139
living quarters and so on,
for Domitian and others;

00:36:46.139 --> 00:36:49.199
a peristyle court;
another peristyle court;

00:36:49.199 --> 00:36:53.539
and then a great sunken stadium
over here on the right.

00:36:53.539 --> 00:36:57.891
This was a far cry from
Romulus' huts,

00:36:57.891 --> 00:37:01.329
as you see them;
Romulus' village,

00:37:01.329 --> 00:37:05.831
of the eighth century B.C.,
that I remind you of over here,

00:37:05.831 --> 00:37:09.789
and show you what has happened
in the interlude.

00:37:09.789 --> 00:37:11.900
But what's extremely important
I think,

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:15.130
given Domitian's view of
himself as lord and god,

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:19.413
as dominus et deus,
it's interesting to see what he

00:37:19.413 --> 00:37:20.090
builds.
 

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:22.916
And he certainly felt that he
was very much in the tradition

00:37:22.916 --> 00:37:25.304
of Romulus;
he wants to associate himself

00:37:25.304 --> 00:37:27.313
with Romulus,
and also, of course,

00:37:27.313 --> 00:37:29.567
with Augustus,
who lived, as you know,

00:37:29.567 --> 00:37:31.150
on the Palatine Hill.
 

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:35.143
But at the same time he wants
to inject his living space with

00:37:35.143 --> 00:37:37.940
the kind of grandeur that had
not been--

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:42.000
that was certainly true under
Nero in his Domus Aurea,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.380
but that had not been true for
any of the other earlier Roman

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.000
emperors.
 

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.117
So the Domus Aurea,
the impact of the Domus Aurea

00:37:48.117 --> 00:37:50.719
once again, is something we
should think about as we look at

00:37:50.719 --> 00:37:51.909
this incredible palace.
 

00:37:51.909 --> 00:37:55.529
This is a plan from the
Ward-Perkins textbook that

00:37:55.529 --> 00:37:59.813
perhaps shows you better than
the view from the air exactly

00:37:59.813 --> 00:38:02.619
what this structure was all
about.

00:38:02.619 --> 00:38:08.181
We see the public wing on the
left-hand side,

00:38:08.181 --> 00:38:15.010
the Domus Flavia of the palace
on the Palatine Hill.

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:17.903
And it includes,
as you can see in the upper

00:38:17.903 --> 00:38:21.202
left corner, a basilica:
a basilica, a room with a

00:38:21.202 --> 00:38:24.097
central space,
divided by two side aisles by

00:38:24.097 --> 00:38:25.039
columns.
 

00:38:25.039 --> 00:38:29.471
And that was a basilica that
Domitian himself sat in and

00:38:29.471 --> 00:38:31.969
tried cases in,
as the judge.

00:38:31.969 --> 00:38:34.516
Then, next to that,
an audience hall,

00:38:34.516 --> 00:38:36.570
or an aula,
a-u-l-a;

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:39.264
that was the place where
Domitian met with visiting

00:38:39.264 --> 00:38:40.018
dignitaries.
 

00:38:40.018 --> 00:38:46.010
Then on axis with the--up in
the upper right,

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:47.291
a lararium,
which was a place where they

00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:50.300
kept household gods and so on--
then on axis with the audience

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.980
hall,
the peristyle, the peristyle.

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:55.585
And if you look at that in
plan, it's got columns,

00:38:55.585 --> 00:38:57.179
of course, as peristyles do.
 

00:38:57.179 --> 00:38:59.199
But look at what's in the
center of it.

00:38:59.199 --> 00:39:02.503
It actually is a fountain,
and it is a fountain that is

00:39:02.503 --> 00:39:03.789
octagonal in shape.
 

00:39:03.789 --> 00:39:07.809
So the impact of Nero's Domus
Aurea immediately clear,

00:39:07.809 --> 00:39:11.663
the impact of that remarkable
octagonal room on the

00:39:11.663 --> 00:39:15.824
architecture of Domitian and on
the architect Rabirius:

00:39:15.824 --> 00:39:18.059
so an octagonal fountain.
 

00:39:18.059 --> 00:39:21.010
And then on axis with the
aula or audience hall,

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:23.507
the peristyle,
is the triclinium or

00:39:23.507 --> 00:39:26.797
dining room of the house:
a very large dining room with

00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:29.903
panoramic windows through which
one could see a very

00:39:29.903 --> 00:39:32.949
interestingly elliptically
shaped fountain,

00:39:32.949 --> 00:39:35.018
one on either side.
 

00:39:35.018 --> 00:39:38.349
Now as you look at that plan of
the Domus Flavia,

00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:41.534
and especially at the basilica,
the audience hall and the

00:39:41.534 --> 00:39:44.237
triclinium,
there is one feature that all

00:39:44.237 --> 00:39:47.929
three of those have in common,
that I haven't yet mentioned,

00:39:47.929 --> 00:39:48.980
which is what?
 

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:54.900
All three of them have what?
 

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:04.829
No one?
 

00:40:04.829 --> 00:40:06.519
Student:  A half circle.
 

00:40:06.519 --> 00:40:08.429
Prof: A half circle;
okay, exactly,

00:40:08.429 --> 00:40:12.699
an apse, an apse on one end,
and all of those apses face in

00:40:12.699 --> 00:40:14.320
the same direction.
 

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.159
The basilica has an apse;
the audience hall has an apse;

00:40:17.159 --> 00:40:18.559
the triclinium has an
apse.

00:40:18.559 --> 00:40:20.260
Those were Domitian's apses.
 

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:23.570
That's where Domitian sat,
dominus et deus;

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.030
he wanted to be honored and,
in fact,

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:28.635
worshipped, as lord and god,
and he needed a space to do it

00:40:28.635 --> 00:40:30.552
in,
and he wanted to sit on a

00:40:30.552 --> 00:40:33.019
throne, underneath the dome of
heaven,

00:40:33.019 --> 00:40:34.030
in a sense.
 

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:35.699
So the dome of heaven was a
vault,

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:38.996
made out of concrete and
decorated in some way in

00:40:38.996 --> 00:40:40.994
antiquity,
probably with mosaic,

00:40:40.994 --> 00:40:43.204
or whatever,
to give it the sense of a dome

00:40:43.204 --> 00:40:43.889
of heaven.
 

00:40:43.889 --> 00:40:47.329
He wanted to sit in that space
in every one of those rooms.

00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:48.809
So whether he was trying a law
case,

00:40:48.809 --> 00:40:52.632
welcoming visiting dignitaries,
or eating in his

00:40:52.632 --> 00:40:56.427
triclinium,
he wanted to sit beneath at

00:40:56.427 --> 00:40:58.670
least a semi-dome of heaven.
 

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:02.210
And that's indeed what he did,
as he was again worshipped as

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:03.710
dominus et deus.
 

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:06.000
So this is a very important,
I think,

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.320
phenomenon in this particular
monument,

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:12.139
and one that is well worth
thinking about,

00:41:12.139 --> 00:41:16.693
in terms of the way in which
architecture is used by given

00:41:16.693 --> 00:41:19.570
individuals to define
themselves,

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:22.639
to define their lives,
and to define their era.

00:41:22.639 --> 00:41:25.018
Over here again the private
wing;

00:41:25.018 --> 00:41:28.132
I'm going to hold on that for a
moment and we'll come back to

00:41:28.132 --> 00:41:28.909
that shortly.
 

00:41:28.909 --> 00:41:32.891
This is a detail of the
basilica, where we see the plan

00:41:32.891 --> 00:41:36.358
of the basilica,
and also a cross-section of the

00:41:36.358 --> 00:41:37.760
same structure.
 

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.496
And you can see it is
completely in keeping with other

00:41:41.496 --> 00:41:45.164
basilican architecture we've
looked at, both in civic

00:41:45.164 --> 00:41:47.139
locations and elsewhere.
 

00:41:47.139 --> 00:41:49.708
A central nave with an apse on
one end--again,

00:41:49.708 --> 00:41:51.820
imagine Domitian sitting over
here;

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:56.960
the central nave divided from
the side aisles by columns,

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:01.550
fairly simple but very
interesting structure in the

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:05.039
context of this particular
palace.

00:42:05.039 --> 00:42:08.530
Over here an outstanding
restored view that probably

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:12.570
gives you a better sense than
almost anything I can show you

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:16.130
of the Domus Flavia or the
public space of Domitian's

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:17.018
Palace.
 

00:42:17.018 --> 00:42:20.179
Here's, of course,
the basilica over here,

00:42:20.179 --> 00:42:22.836
and you can see that this room,
like all of the rooms in this

00:42:22.836 --> 00:42:24.983
palace,
were done in marble,

00:42:24.983 --> 00:42:28.389
and that marble was of various
colors,

00:42:28.389 --> 00:42:30.655
as you can see here,
and it was marble that was

00:42:30.655 --> 00:42:32.329
brought from all over the world.
 

00:42:32.329 --> 00:42:34.420
We've talked about the fact
that the Flavians did this.

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:36.909
We've talked about this as the
case for the Templum Pacis,

00:42:36.909 --> 00:42:40.554
for example,
bringing marble from Egypt and

00:42:40.554 --> 00:42:45.590
Asia Minor and Greece and
elsewhere in the Roman world,

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:49.869
bringing it all here and using
it, using that variegated marble

00:42:49.869 --> 00:42:51.927
to make--
to ornament,

00:42:51.927 --> 00:42:55.389
obviously, this palace in Rome.
 

00:42:55.389 --> 00:42:59.440
Over here the aula or
the great audience hall;

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:03.458
the Aula Regia we call it,
over here, also with the marble

00:43:03.458 --> 00:43:06.280
on the floor,
as well as on the walls.

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.289
You can see that this
particular room--

00:43:08.289 --> 00:43:10.119
and it was apparent in plan as
well--

00:43:10.119 --> 00:43:15.215
has scalloping around the
perimeter of the room:

00:43:15.215 --> 00:43:18.980
a series of niches,
as you can see,

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:22.907
with statuary in them,
surrounded by columns,

00:43:22.907 --> 00:43:26.030
two tiers with other windows up
above,

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:29.010
as you can see.
 

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:31.614
And here you get a sense of
that space in which Domitian

00:43:31.614 --> 00:43:33.510
would have sat:
the apse of the room,

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:36.090
the curvature of the wall,
made, of course,

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:38.469
out of concrete--as this entire
structure was--

00:43:38.469 --> 00:43:40.780
made out of concrete,
with a semi-dome.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:44.831
And you have to again imagine
Domitian sitting beneath that,

00:43:44.831 --> 00:43:48.539
or inside that apse and beneath
that semi-dome here.

00:43:48.539 --> 00:43:50.739
The peristyle court,
open to the sky;

00:43:50.739 --> 00:43:53.543
columns all around,
covered colonnade,

00:43:53.543 --> 00:43:56.496
two stories,
and then in the center this

00:43:56.496 --> 00:43:58.239
octagonal fountain.
 

00:43:58.239 --> 00:44:01.150
Leave it to Domitian,
leave it to Rabirius,

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:04.614
to transform Nero's octagonal
room into a fountain,

00:44:04.614 --> 00:44:06.969
in the context of this palace.
 

00:44:06.969 --> 00:44:09.969
And then on axis again,
with the Aula Regia,

00:44:09.969 --> 00:44:13.530
and with the peristyle,
is the triclinium.

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:16.262
And this restored view again
gives you a very good sense of

00:44:16.262 --> 00:44:18.900
that apse in which Domitian
would have sat enthroned,

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.949
with the semi-dome above his
head, two tiers;

00:44:21.949 --> 00:44:25.708
again, the walls decorated with
variegated marbles brought from

00:44:25.708 --> 00:44:27.829
all different parts of the
world;

00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:29.280
as well as with columns.
 

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.570
And then picture windows,
through which you would see

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:35.291
these very interesting
elliptical fountains,

00:44:35.291 --> 00:44:37.697
as you dined,
one on either side of the

00:44:37.697 --> 00:44:38.710
structure.
 

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:42.177
There's a lot of controversy as
to how the rooms that were

00:44:42.177 --> 00:44:46.010
roofed, were roofed -- whether
they had barrel vaults or not.

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:48.264
You can see this particular
restored view shows one flat

00:44:48.264 --> 00:44:49.699
roof and one barrel vaulted
roof.

00:44:49.699 --> 00:44:53.782
We're not absolutely sure about
that, and again scholars

00:44:53.782 --> 00:44:57.050
continue to argue which was the
case here.

00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:00.389
I mentioned statuary in the
Aula Regia,

00:45:00.389 --> 00:45:04.221
and we have some evidence for
what that statuary might have

00:45:04.221 --> 00:45:06.309
been like,
and the way in which it was

00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:07.130
used by Domitian.
 

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:08.349
I show you two examples.
 

00:45:08.349 --> 00:45:11.550
These are two statues,
one representing Hercules,

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:13.284
on the left,
and the other,

00:45:13.284 --> 00:45:15.820
on the right,
representing Apollo.

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:20.139
And these are truly colossal in
scale,

00:45:20.139 --> 00:45:23.590
and they are made of beautiful
materials,

00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:26.856
again imported materials -- in
this case a kind of maroon

00:45:26.856 --> 00:45:29.829
colored stone,
and in this case a greenish

00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:30.929
colored stone.
 

00:45:30.929 --> 00:45:33.869
Again, they're very large in
scale, colossal in scale,

00:45:33.869 --> 00:45:37.143
and you can see the exaggerated
musculature of both of these

00:45:37.143 --> 00:45:37.809
figures.
 

00:45:37.809 --> 00:45:41.059
And I think they are very
telling in terms of--

00:45:41.059 --> 00:45:44.987
as we think about Domitian
sitting in rooms like the Aula

00:45:44.987 --> 00:45:46.864
Regia,
greeting visitors,

00:45:46.864 --> 00:45:49.699
and when you think about what
this man,

00:45:49.699 --> 00:45:52.940
who wanted to be worshipped as
lord and god thought of himself,

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:55.818
and you see the kind of
statuary that he surrounded

00:45:55.818 --> 00:45:58.168
himself with--
this is a very different man

00:45:58.168 --> 00:46:01.393
than his predecessor Claudius--
the kind of imagery that he

00:46:01.393 --> 00:46:02.869
associated himself with.
 

00:46:02.869 --> 00:46:08.179
It's a way of pumping himself
up, I think, by having himself

00:46:08.179 --> 00:46:13.219
surrounded by these very
athletic figures of Hercules and

00:46:13.219 --> 00:46:14.929
also of Apollo.
 

00:46:14.929 --> 00:46:18.070
What do you think this is,
just from looking at it?

00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:21.074
The remains--you can see the
remains are not as extensive as

00:46:21.074 --> 00:46:23.670
one wishes they were,
but enough is there to allow a

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:25.300
reconstruction of the whole.
 

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:27.719
What are we looking at here?
 

00:46:27.719 --> 00:46:29.119
Student:  The octagonal
fountain..

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:31.150
Prof: The octagonal
fountain, the octagonal fountain

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:32.130
of the peristyle court.
 

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:32.726
Excellent.
 

00:46:32.726 --> 00:46:35.836
See it's really--most people,
who wander around these

00:46:35.836 --> 00:46:39.126
remains, would not be able to
figure out for the life of

00:46:39.126 --> 00:46:40.920
themselves what this was.
 

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:44.518
But you'll be glad when you go
up on the Palatine Hill to know,

00:46:44.518 --> 00:46:47.275
as you stand here,
that this was once an octagonal

00:46:47.275 --> 00:46:49.976
fountain,
with a spectacular water

00:46:49.976 --> 00:46:51.750
display undoubtedly.
 

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:55.835
This is the triclinium,
or what survives--sad--what

00:46:55.835 --> 00:46:58.920
survives of Domitian's
triclinium.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.882
This is his apse;
this is the very apse in which

00:47:01.882 --> 00:47:04.940
Domitian would have sat
enthroned, as he ate with

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:08.192
special invited guests,
as he held a state dinner in

00:47:08.192 --> 00:47:08.829
Rome.
 

00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:11.032
And you can see,
if you look very carefully,

00:47:11.032 --> 00:47:13.338
again the construction is
brick-faced concrete

00:47:13.338 --> 00:47:14.210
construction.
 

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:17.719
We talked about the fact that
after the fire of 64,

00:47:17.719 --> 00:47:23.559
a decision was made to begin to
use brick as a facing,

00:47:23.559 --> 00:47:26.420
because brick was more
fireproof than stone.

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:30.083
And we see that borne out;
the entire Imperial Palace on

00:47:30.083 --> 00:47:33.367
the Palatine Hill was made of
brick-faced concrete

00:47:33.367 --> 00:47:34.440
construction.
 

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:37.628
But if you look very carefully,
you will see some stucco and

00:47:37.628 --> 00:47:39.900
you will also see some marble
revetment.

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:42.835
So, in this case,
that brick was covered over

00:47:42.835 --> 00:47:46.637
with marble, to give it a much
more luxurious look for the

00:47:46.637 --> 00:47:48.440
dominus et deus.
 

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:52.532
Also interesting here--actually
there's a tarp on top of

00:47:52.532 --> 00:47:56.036
preserved mosaic,
and I'll show you that mosaic

00:47:56.036 --> 00:47:58.628
in a moment--
but what's interesting here is

00:47:58.628 --> 00:48:01.759
that the pavement rests on
something that should remind you

00:48:01.759 --> 00:48:04.349
of something we saw earlier in
the semester,

00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:06.019
which is what?
 

00:48:06.019 --> 00:48:07.139
You're nodding, so.
 

00:48:07.139 --> 00:48:07.577
Student:  The
hypocaust..

00:48:07.577 --> 00:48:08.000
Prof: The hypocaust.
 

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.282
It's a hypocaust system;
just as we saw in the Stabian

00:48:11.282 --> 00:48:14.385
Baths in Pompeii,
they have raised the pavement

00:48:14.385 --> 00:48:18.918
up on these piles of brick,
and then in between them would

00:48:18.918 --> 00:48:24.059
have placed terracotta pipes and
also braziers with hot,

00:48:24.059 --> 00:48:27.184
hot coals, and so on and so
forth, to heat the floor of the

00:48:27.184 --> 00:48:29.724
triclinium,
so that Domitian could not only

00:48:29.724 --> 00:48:32.800
sit in his apse,
but could have his feet warm

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:33.820
while he ate.
 

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:37.960
This gives you again I think a
really good window into the kind

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:41.579
of man we are dealing with here,
and what he was trying to

00:48:41.579 --> 00:48:43.780
achieve, once again through
architecture,

00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:45.690
through architecture.
 

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:50.010
This is another view of the
apse in which Domitian sat,

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:52.768
and here we do see--without the
tarp we can see that the mosaic

00:48:52.768 --> 00:48:54.369
is actually pretty well
preserved.

00:48:54.369 --> 00:49:00.010
And it is the colors that we so
often find in Roman mosaics ,

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:02.163
especially in major public
buildings and in private

00:49:02.163 --> 00:49:03.800
palaces: this combination of
green,

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:06.032
maroon and white,
as you see here,

00:49:06.032 --> 00:49:09.619
with a variety of very
attractive geometric shapes.

00:49:09.619 --> 00:49:12.070
Again, you can see the concrete
construction,

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:15.043
faced with brick,
and you can see the remains of

00:49:15.043 --> 00:49:18.521
some of the marble revetment
that would have covered the

00:49:18.521 --> 00:49:21.875
walls and made this all that
much more ostentatious in

00:49:21.875 --> 00:49:23.519
ancient Roman times.
 

00:49:23.519 --> 00:49:25.500
This fountain is a marvel.
 

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:26.510
I love this fountain.
 

00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:30.612
This is the fountain that you
see, or one of the two that you

00:49:30.612 --> 00:49:34.989
would see, through the panoramic
windows of the triclinium

00:49:34.989 --> 00:49:36.699
in Domitian's Palace.
 

00:49:36.699 --> 00:49:42.882
And this is where I think the
genius of Rabirius shows

00:49:42.882 --> 00:49:44.744
through;
and Rabirius shows,

00:49:44.744 --> 00:49:46.789
in a sense, himself to be the
Frank Gehry of his day --

00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:51.239
somebody who really enjoyed
undulating forms,

00:49:51.239 --> 00:49:55.277
and the way in which concavity
and convexity can be played off

00:49:55.277 --> 00:49:58.219
against one another,
to great result.

00:49:58.219 --> 00:50:00.000
It's an elliptical fountain.
 

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.360
It's fairly small in scale.
 

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.170
It's elliptical,
as you can see here,

00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:09.380
and the convexity of that
ellipse played off--

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.079
and you see it repeated again
here--

00:50:11.079 --> 00:50:14.579
played off against these
interesting undulating walls;

00:50:14.579 --> 00:50:17.862
all of this created again out
of concrete and faced with

00:50:17.862 --> 00:50:18.340
brick.
 

00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:22.456
So you imagine the bricks have
to be very carefully molded to

00:50:22.456 --> 00:50:26.369
fit where they need to fit into
this incredible scheme.

00:50:26.369 --> 00:50:28.295
And, of course,
in antiquity this would have

00:50:28.295 --> 00:50:30.398
been stuccoed over,
and probably had some marble

00:50:30.398 --> 00:50:32.369
revetment on it,
and so on and so forth.

00:50:32.369 --> 00:50:34.869
But the shape is absolutely
marvelous,

00:50:34.869 --> 00:50:38.135
and I think we are definitely
in the presence of a great

00:50:38.135 --> 00:50:42.052
architectural genius,
in the person of Rabirius,

00:50:42.052 --> 00:50:44.929
who was working for Domitian.
 

00:50:44.929 --> 00:50:48.617
The private wing of the palace,
equally spectacular in its own

00:50:48.617 --> 00:50:48.980
way.
 

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:53.764
I mentioned to you already that
it's larger in the space that it

00:50:53.764 --> 00:50:56.119
covers than the Domus Flavia.
 

00:50:56.119 --> 00:50:59.007
And part of it is on two
stories, the part that you see

00:50:59.007 --> 00:50:59.650
over here.
 

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:04.382
There's a fountain court in the
center, and then two stories of

00:51:04.382 --> 00:51:07.829
rooms around that;
another peristyle back here;

00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:11.130
and then a stadium,
once again a hairpin shape,

00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:15.364
with a curved side and a flat
side, just like his stadium in

00:51:15.364 --> 00:51:16.010
Rome.
 

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:19.114
But he already had a stadium,
a public stadium,

00:51:19.114 --> 00:51:22.422
where one could watch
racehorses and races and the

00:51:22.422 --> 00:51:23.030
like.
 

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:24.260
He used this instead.
 

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.563
And it's actually
sunken--because remember this

00:51:26.563 --> 00:51:29.568
part is two stories--this is
sunken, a sunken stadium next to

00:51:29.568 --> 00:51:29.920
it.
 

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:33.980
It was used as a place for
pleasurable walks,

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:37.380
as a kind of outdoor garden
where Domitian,

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:42.768
and again special visitors,
could spend some time,

00:51:42.768 --> 00:51:45.010
a pleasant place to walk within
the city.

00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:51.400
We see here another axonometric
view from Ward-Perkins,

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.530
where we can also get a very
good sense,

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:57.378
not only of the Domus Flavia,
as we've already described it:

00:51:57.378 --> 00:52:00.380
the basilica and the
aula on one end;

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:02.460
the octagonal fountain in the
center;

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:06.737
and then over here the dining
hall with the two elliptical

00:52:06.737 --> 00:52:09.139
fountains, one on either side.
 

00:52:09.139 --> 00:52:14.211
Here we see again the private
area with the sunken stadium

00:52:14.211 --> 00:52:16.976
over here;
with the peristyle court with a

00:52:16.976 --> 00:52:20.360
fountain in the center;
two stories around that;

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:24.032
and then over here another
couple of other peristyle

00:52:24.032 --> 00:52:24.679
courts.
 

00:52:24.679 --> 00:52:26.960
There are actually three
peristyle courts in total here.

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:29.072
But what's interesting,
I think, when you look at this

00:52:29.072 --> 00:52:32.014
axonometric view,
I think it's interesting to see

00:52:32.014 --> 00:52:34.306
that--
or a kind of cutaway view--to

00:52:34.306 --> 00:52:38.108
see that from the outside a lot
of these spaces didn't look as

00:52:38.108 --> 00:52:40.789
interesting as they did from the
inside.

00:52:40.789 --> 00:52:44.221
We are definitely moving--we've
seen that be the case for

00:52:44.221 --> 00:52:47.039
awhile, vis-à-vis Roman
architecture.

00:52:47.039 --> 00:52:49.612
Think back to some of the early
residences in Pompeii where they

00:52:49.612 --> 00:52:51.449
were very plain and severe on
the outside,

00:52:51.449 --> 00:52:54.125
but when you went inside and
saw the atrium and the

00:52:54.125 --> 00:52:56.746
impluvium and the
compluvium and the

00:52:56.746 --> 00:52:58.699
garden,
it was something else again;

00:52:58.699 --> 00:53:00.210
this whole element of surprise.
 

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:02.369
And that's true even here,
I think,

00:53:02.369 --> 00:53:05.481
in this palace,
where the structures are less

00:53:05.481 --> 00:53:09.512
interesting from the outside and
more interesting from the

00:53:09.512 --> 00:53:11.070
interiors of them.
 

00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:14.795
Here's a Google Earth image
again of just the private part

00:53:14.795 --> 00:53:18.849
of the palace where we see this
interesting peristyle court;

00:53:18.849 --> 00:53:21.010
the other two peristyle courts
behind it;

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:24.059
these rooms placed on two
stories;

00:53:24.059 --> 00:53:26.730
and then once again the sunken
stadium.

00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:30.010
The sunken stadium is actually
quite well preserved.

00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:31.902
As you can see here,
it's one of the better

00:53:31.902 --> 00:53:33.570
preserved parts of the villa
today.

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:36.106
You can get a very good sense,
not only of its shape but also

00:53:36.106 --> 00:53:39.110
of its scale;
it's enormous, a huge stadium.

00:53:39.110 --> 00:53:43.010
And again you have to imagine
Domitian wandering around here.

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:46.289
And you can see the curved end
on one side,

00:53:46.289 --> 00:53:48.730
but most importantly the
concrete construction,

00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:52.634
faced with brick,
and including columns and other

00:53:52.634 --> 00:53:54.179
marble revetment.
 

00:53:54.179 --> 00:53:58.630
This is a view of that first
court, the one that has rooms on

00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:00.409
two stories around it.
 

00:54:00.409 --> 00:54:05.123
Once again, Rabirius has had a
great deal of fun with his

00:54:05.123 --> 00:54:06.050
fountain.
 

00:54:06.050 --> 00:54:08.813
He seems to have taken
particular pleasure in designing

00:54:08.813 --> 00:54:11.882
fountains and in letting his
imagination run free with regard

00:54:11.882 --> 00:54:13.059
to fountain design.
 

00:54:13.059 --> 00:54:18.829
You see here again he's playing
off convex against concave.

00:54:18.829 --> 00:54:21.768
He's done all of this out of
concrete;

00:54:21.768 --> 00:54:26.010
these shapes are done in
concrete, faced with brick,

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:28.851
and again the bricks have to be
molded very specially to fit the

00:54:28.851 --> 00:54:31.889
space within that,
that they need to accommodate

00:54:31.889 --> 00:54:32.969
themselves to.
 

00:54:32.969 --> 00:54:36.150
And if any of you know anything
about those female warriors

00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:38.563
called the Amazons,
they carry shields called

00:54:38.563 --> 00:54:41.632
peltas, p-e-l-t-a;
these should remind you--don't

00:54:41.632 --> 00:54:43.059
they look like peltae?
 

00:54:43.059 --> 00:54:45.498
They look very much
like--that's probably

00:54:45.498 --> 00:54:47.875
coincidental,
I'm not implying here that

00:54:47.875 --> 00:54:51.045
there's any particular
iconography to this particular

00:54:51.045 --> 00:54:51.960
fountain.
 

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:52.869
But who knows?
 

00:54:52.869 --> 00:54:55.990
But they do look very much like
shields that are carried by

00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.960
Amazonian women.
 

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:59.773
But at any rate,
this playing off of convex

00:54:59.773 --> 00:55:02.795
against concave;
Rabirius is clearly enjoying

00:55:02.795 --> 00:55:04.610
himself with this monument.
 

00:55:04.610 --> 00:55:08.010
Then the rooms on two stories.
 

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:10.130
And you see,
just as we saw quite some time

00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:13.010
ago in the second phase of the
Villa of the Mysteries,

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:16.119
where they were beginning to
open up the exterior and create

00:55:16.119 --> 00:55:19.440
bay windows and more windows and
make it less severe than it had

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.550
been in the original Domus
Italica,

00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:24.440
we see that sort of thing here:
many more windows used,

00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:25.760
the wall being opened up.
 

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:30.414
They've gotten so sophisticated
in their use of concrete that

00:55:30.414 --> 00:55:33.750
they are able to open the walls
up more,

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:36.518
with these rectangular windows
of different shapes--

00:55:36.518 --> 00:55:38.829
as you can see,
some large, some smaller,

00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:40.188
some on the ground,
some higher,

00:55:40.188 --> 00:55:43.384
sort of like windows--
and then above additional

00:55:43.384 --> 00:55:46.730
openings that are arcuated on
the top.

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:51.550
So clearly he's again enjoying
opening up this wall and

00:55:51.550 --> 00:55:56.639
creating interesting views,
from one part of the structure

00:55:56.639 --> 00:55:57.980
to another.
 

00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:01.449
Two more images of that
wonderful fountain,

00:56:01.449 --> 00:56:04.829
where I think you can see even
better the way in which this has

00:56:04.829 --> 00:56:07.469
all been done out of concrete,
faced with brick.

00:56:07.469 --> 00:56:10.744
And you have to imagine,
of course, the spectacular

00:56:10.744 --> 00:56:13.494
water display,
the actually water jets that

00:56:13.494 --> 00:56:14.869
would've come up.
 

00:56:14.869 --> 00:56:18.692
The Bellagio it may not have
been, but it probably was

00:56:18.692 --> 00:56:21.304
something--
sort of the ancient version of

00:56:21.304 --> 00:56:25.230
the Bellagio in Las Vegas,
the fountains at the Bellagio.

00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:29.460
Here you see a restored view of
this fountain court,

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:33.139
where you get a sense that once
you add a bunch of statuary and

00:56:33.139 --> 00:56:35.291
water jets--
which you don't see actually

00:56:35.291 --> 00:56:37.396
working here--
and paint the walls,

00:56:37.396 --> 00:56:41.518
the whole thing would've been
even more spectacular still;

00:56:41.518 --> 00:56:44.271
and I think that gives you some
general sense of the original

00:56:44.271 --> 00:56:45.510
appearance of the palace.
 

00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:50.510
Around the court,
the fountain court,

00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:52.920
and the private wing that we've
just looked at,

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:56.213
there were a series of rooms,
and if you look at some of

00:56:56.213 --> 00:57:00.547
those rooms in detail,
I think you'll be amazed by

00:57:00.547 --> 00:57:02.865
what you see;
some fantastically shaped

00:57:02.865 --> 00:57:04.389
rooms: some of them cruciform,
cross-shaped;

00:57:04.389 --> 00:57:07.773
some of them going way back to
the frigidaria with

00:57:07.773 --> 00:57:10.190
circular rooms with radiating
alcoves.

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:14.409
And not surprisingly,
again given what Severus and

00:57:14.409 --> 00:57:18.889
Celer were able to achieve at
Nero's Domus Aurea,

00:57:18.889 --> 00:57:22.684
given the fact that the octagon
is clearly also in the mind of

00:57:22.684 --> 00:57:26.815
Rabirius in this building,
we see him creating small

00:57:26.815 --> 00:57:30.880
octagonal rooms,
and exploring and experimenting

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.039
with those octagonal rooms.
 

00:57:33.039 --> 00:57:35.818
And you see a couple of them in
plan, on the side,

00:57:35.818 --> 00:57:38.369
on one of the sides of this
fountain court.

00:57:38.369 --> 00:57:41.481
I show you here a view from,
or several views from the

00:57:41.481 --> 00:57:46.826
Ward-Perkins textbook,
where we see a cross-section,

00:57:46.826 --> 00:57:49.864
a plan,
and also an axonometric view of

00:57:49.864 --> 00:57:53.358
one of these octagonal rooms
that we believe was designed by

00:57:53.358 --> 00:57:55.489
Rabirius for the Palatine
Palace.

00:57:55.489 --> 00:58:00.733
And I compare it down here to
the octagonal room of Nero's

00:58:00.733 --> 00:58:06.163
Domus Aurea, which was clearly
the model for Rabirius' foray

00:58:06.163 --> 00:58:08.739
into designing octagons.
 

00:58:08.739 --> 00:58:12.293
It's a much smaller room than
Nero's octagonal room,

00:58:12.293 --> 00:58:15.639
but he takes the whole concept
a step further.

00:58:15.639 --> 00:58:18.199
It's an octagon;
yes, it's eight sided,

00:58:18.199 --> 00:58:19.769
just like the Domus Aurea.
 

00:58:19.769 --> 00:58:21.760
It has radiating alcoves.
 

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:26.938
Some of them are rectangular,
some of them are circular,

00:58:26.938 --> 00:58:29.010
as you can see here.
 

00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:30.786
And if you look at the
axonometric view,

00:58:30.786 --> 00:58:33.610
you will see two interesting
things that are a step forward.

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:37.858
One of them is the fact that
although in the Domus Aurea the

00:58:37.858 --> 00:58:41.442
eight-sided room--
although the room was

00:58:41.442 --> 00:58:46.849
eight-sided, the dome was itself
essentially curved;

00:58:46.849 --> 00:58:48.590
it's a traditional dome.
 

00:58:48.590 --> 00:58:52.815
What we see happening here
though is they take the eight

00:58:52.815 --> 00:58:57.039
sides and continue that
segmented feel into the dome.

00:58:57.039 --> 00:59:01.411
So we have an eight-sided
segmented dome in this octagonal

00:59:01.411 --> 00:59:05.632
room in the Palatine Palace,
which is different than the

00:59:05.632 --> 00:59:06.860
Domus Aurea.
 

00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:08.800
And the other thing,
and perhaps even more

00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:10.864
significant,
is the fact that if we look at

00:59:10.864 --> 00:59:13.443
the individual niches,
we will see that they are

00:59:13.443 --> 00:59:16.842
envelopes of space,
in the same way that Nero's

00:59:16.842 --> 00:59:19.840
Domus Aurea was,
and that they have--and just

00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:24.829
like Nero's Domus Aurea,
they have niches within niches.

00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:27.914
But what Rabirius has done here
is something really quite

00:59:27.914 --> 00:59:31.442
extraordinary and very different
from anything we've seen earlier

00:59:31.442 --> 00:59:35.423
in Roman architecture,
and that is he's placed some of

00:59:35.423 --> 00:59:39.768
these additional niches or
windows or doorways off axis

00:59:39.768 --> 00:59:41.780
with the niche itself.
 

00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:44.824
Now we have seen that the
Romans cared above all about

00:59:44.824 --> 00:59:47.702
axiality and symmetry,
and yet we see here--and this

00:59:47.702 --> 00:59:50.489
is why I call him the Frank
Gehry of Roman architects--

00:59:50.489 --> 00:59:55.880
he is willing to try something
entirely different.

00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:00.440
He is clearly enamored of
circles and rectangles and domes

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:03.387
and the like,
but he is also willing to

01:00:03.387 --> 01:00:07.190
dispense with the usual axiality
of Roman architecture,

01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:12.289
and explore placing things off
axis in a quite inventive way.

01:00:12.289 --> 01:00:16.929
And I can show you that even
better by looking quickly at the

01:00:16.929 --> 01:00:20.409
two views of one of these
octagonal rooms,

01:00:20.409 --> 01:00:25.030
from the private wing of the
Palatine Palace,

01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:27.277
where you can see not only--and
I hope you can see it from where

01:00:27.277 --> 01:00:28.753
you are--
you can see not only the

01:00:28.753 --> 01:00:30.650
segments--can you see the
segmented dome?

01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:32.070
I think quite clearly here.
 

01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:34.340
You can see these envelopes of
space.

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:37.612
You can see these openings;
this whole idea of creating

01:00:37.612 --> 01:00:40.869
vistas from one building to
another but--

01:00:40.869 --> 01:00:42.768
and you can see the way in
which these vary,

01:00:42.768 --> 01:00:45.239
that some are doorways,
some are windows--

01:00:45.239 --> 01:00:48.614
but I think you can also see
the way in which he is beginning

01:00:48.614 --> 01:00:51.458
to place--
here's a window that is placed

01:00:51.458 --> 01:00:54.059
completely off axis with the
niche.

01:00:54.059 --> 01:00:56.409
This is even more apparent in
this other view,

01:00:56.409 --> 01:00:59.369
where you can see one of these
radiating niches,

01:00:59.369 --> 01:01:02.579
and in that radiating niche
there's an opening that starts

01:01:02.579 --> 01:01:04.766
at the floor,
and then there's another

01:01:04.766 --> 01:01:09.010
opening, to the left of it,
that's higher up.

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:11.882
And again you get this sense of
asymmetry, rather than symmetry,

01:01:11.882 --> 01:01:12.340
in this.
 

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:14.480
And this is again very
experimental,

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.931
very different;
it really is different than

01:01:16.931 --> 01:01:20.065
almost anything I can show you,
not only before but even after

01:01:20.065 --> 01:01:23.818
this great work of architecture,
and it gives us some insight

01:01:23.818 --> 01:01:29.081
into the creativity of Rabirius,
and the way in which Domitian

01:01:29.081 --> 01:01:31.268
was allowing him to be.
 

01:01:31.268 --> 01:01:32.880
Because I think this goes above
and beyond.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:35.280
Clearly Domitian is imaging
himself;

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:38.407
I think especially in the
public realm of this building,

01:01:38.407 --> 01:01:41.704
he's very concerned with how
he's presenting himself to his

01:01:41.704 --> 01:01:42.329
public.
 

01:01:42.329 --> 01:01:45.744
Over here I have the sense that
he has really let Rabirius be

01:01:45.744 --> 01:01:48.007
Rabirius;
that he's let Rabirius do what

01:01:48.007 --> 01:01:51.231
he wanted to do to create an
interesting and architecturally

01:01:51.231 --> 01:01:54.835
exciting space,
in which he could live and

01:01:54.835 --> 01:02:00.264
could enjoy some of the
interesting architectural motifs

01:02:00.264 --> 01:02:05.989
that Rabirius instills in this
extraordinary structure.

01:02:05.989 --> 01:02:10.610
Now Domitian was succeeded by
John Kerry;

01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:12.983
no, well sort of,
in the sense that he was

01:02:12.983 --> 01:02:16.398
succeeded by a man by the name
of Nerva, who looks very much

01:02:16.398 --> 01:02:18.539
like John Kerry,
don't you think?

01:02:18.539 --> 01:02:22.119
That's a coin of Nerva on the
left-hand side of the screen.

01:02:22.119 --> 01:02:25.864
Domitian, by the way--I think I
may have forgotten to mention,

01:02:25.864 --> 01:02:28.320
but he ended up just the way
Nero did.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.400
He was--well in his case he was
actually assassinated;

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.132
Nero was forced to commit
suicide but Domitian was

01:02:34.132 --> 01:02:34.969
assassinated.
 

01:02:34.969 --> 01:02:38.610
He was issued a damnatio
memoriae at his death.

01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:42.949
And he was succeeded by Nerva,
Nerva who was appointed by the

01:02:42.949 --> 01:02:43.599
Senate.
 

01:02:43.599 --> 01:02:47.090
The Senate had had it with
despots, and they decided the

01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:49.820
time had come to choose one of
their own.

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:52.947
And they selected Nerva,
who was an elderly and very

01:02:52.947 --> 01:02:55.400
highly respected member of the
Senate.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.329
And this was the first time the
Senate did this--

01:02:57.329 --> 01:03:00.219
since Augustus founded the
Empire in his reign,

01:03:00.219 --> 01:03:04.884
the first emperor of Rome--this
is the first time that an

01:03:04.884 --> 01:03:08.050
emperor was appointed by the
Senate.

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:11.181
And Nerva was a highly
respected and pretty

01:03:11.181 --> 01:03:14.686
level-headed guy,
and he was able to bring peace

01:03:14.686 --> 01:03:17.518
and prosperity back to the
Empire.

01:03:17.518 --> 01:03:21.010
He did not last very long
however.

01:03:21.010 --> 01:03:24.485
He had a very brief reign,
and therefore very little time

01:03:24.485 --> 01:03:26.719
to have an impact on
architecture.

01:03:26.719 --> 01:03:30.081
But again you see him
represented on a coin on the

01:03:30.081 --> 01:03:32.210
left-hand side of the screen.
 

01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:34.090
I'd like to show you one
building though;

01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:39.418
I'd like to end today with one
building that was actually begun

01:03:39.418 --> 01:03:43.030
by Domitian and then completed
by Nerva.

01:03:43.030 --> 01:03:45.601
It began as the so-called Forum
Transitorium,

01:03:45.601 --> 01:03:48.233
under Domitian,
and became the Forum of Nerva,

01:03:48.233 --> 01:03:49.170
under Nerva.
 

01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:52.898
In order to do this I need to
take you to the general plan of

01:03:52.898 --> 01:03:54.639
the Imperial Fora in Rome.
 

01:03:54.639 --> 01:03:56.110
We've looked at this before.
 

01:03:56.110 --> 01:03:59.559
You'll remember the location of
the Roman Forum here,

01:03:59.559 --> 01:04:03.275
and obviously down below:
the Forum of Julius Caesar that

01:04:03.275 --> 01:04:06.365
we've already studied;
the Forum of Augustus built

01:04:06.365 --> 01:04:08.744
right next to that,
that we've also looked at in

01:04:08.744 --> 01:04:10.871
detail;
and then the Forum Pacis,

01:04:10.871 --> 01:04:13.210
or the Templum Pacis of
Vespasian,

01:04:13.210 --> 01:04:17.010
which we have looked at more
recently,

01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:20.019
and which you'll recall was
built in such a way so that it

01:04:20.019 --> 01:04:23.293
faced the Forum of Augustus and
the Forum of Julius Caesar next

01:04:23.293 --> 01:04:23.768
door.
 

01:04:23.768 --> 01:04:28.442
I mentioned to you I think
already that there was a very

01:04:28.442 --> 01:04:32.349
large piece of property over
here that was--

01:04:32.349 --> 01:04:34.809
on which stood essentially one
of Rome's Seven Hills,

01:04:34.809 --> 01:04:37.969
the Quirinal
Hill--Q-u-i-r-i-n-a-l;

01:04:37.969 --> 01:04:41.219
the Quirinal Hill of Rome
occupied this area.

01:04:41.219 --> 01:04:44.110
But it was an area that was
being eyed by Domitian.

01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:46.349
You can see from his palace
that he had big plans,

01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:48.559
and once the palace was coming
to fruition,

01:04:48.559 --> 01:04:52.289
he was thinking again about
public architecture and the fact

01:04:52.289 --> 01:04:55.958
that he would really like to
build a forum to rival that of

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:58.632
his father,
a forum that was bigger than

01:04:58.632 --> 01:04:59.940
that of his father's.
 

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:03.864
And he'd like to put it over
here, facing his father's forum,

01:05:03.864 --> 01:05:07.920
across the Forum of Augustus
and the Forum of Julius Caesar.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:12.201
He dreamed those big dreams but
he was never able to realize

01:05:12.201 --> 01:05:12.710
them.
 

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:18.048
What he did instead was to take
this area that was located

01:05:18.048 --> 01:05:23.295
between the Forum of Vespasian
and the Forum of Augustus,

01:05:23.295 --> 01:05:29.494
the Forum of Julius Caesar;
this area that I mentioned to

01:05:29.494 --> 01:05:35.059
you was called the
Argiletum--A-r-g-i-l-e-t-u-m;

01:05:35.059 --> 01:05:36.880
I think I've got it there,
the Argiletum.

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:42.197
That area was a street that
connected the Roman Forum with

01:05:42.197 --> 01:05:45.650
an area of Rome called the
Subura--

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:49.391
S-u-b-u-r-a--the Subura,
which was a residential area

01:05:49.391 --> 01:05:53.347
that I mentioned had in it
mostly these wooden apartment

01:05:53.347 --> 01:05:56.090
houses;
large numbers of people lived

01:05:56.090 --> 01:05:57.099
in the Subura.
 

01:05:57.099 --> 01:05:59.376
So there was this street,
the Argiletum,

01:05:59.376 --> 01:06:02.239
that attached the two,
or connected the two to one

01:06:02.239 --> 01:06:02.940
another.
 

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:05.822
And Domitian decided to use
that as a forum,

01:06:05.822 --> 01:06:09.242
to himself, that would be
placed next to that of his

01:06:09.242 --> 01:06:09.980
father.
 

01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:13.628
And he placed in that forum a
temple of his patron goddess

01:06:13.628 --> 01:06:16.807
Minerva;
his patron goddess was Minerva,

01:06:16.807 --> 01:06:21.230
and he built a temple to honor
her, in this location.

01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:26.012
Because this forum was like a
street and was so narrow,

01:06:26.012 --> 01:06:30.440
that had an effect on what
could be built there;

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:32.239
so that you can see,
for example,

01:06:32.239 --> 01:06:34.876
in plan,
that while the Forums of Julius

01:06:34.876 --> 01:06:38.036
Caesar and Augustus,
and the Forum Pacis,

01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:41.543
all had colonnades,
covered colonnades in fact,

01:06:41.543 --> 01:06:44.929
there was no space to build a
covered colonnade here.

01:06:44.929 --> 01:06:49.259
So what they had to do was
place the columns very close to

01:06:49.259 --> 01:06:53.739
the wall and not put any ceiling
on top of those columns.

01:06:53.739 --> 01:06:55.829
You can see the same here.
 

01:06:55.829 --> 01:07:02.018
This is a plan of the original
Forum of Domitian,

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:04.380
or what was called the Forum
Transitorium,

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:08.394
because it served as a point of
transit between the Subura and

01:07:08.394 --> 01:07:09.579
the Roman Forum.
 

01:07:09.579 --> 01:07:12.871
The Temple of Minerva over
here, consistent with temple

01:07:12.871 --> 01:07:16.039
architecture as we've seen it
thus far this semester:

01:07:16.039 --> 01:07:18.539
a temple with a frontal
orientation,

01:07:18.539 --> 01:07:21.110
single staircase,
façade orientation,

01:07:21.110 --> 01:07:23.469
freestanding columns in the
porch, and so on.

01:07:23.469 --> 01:07:25.420
The entranceway over here.
 

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.159
The Forum Pacis would be here.
 

01:07:27.159 --> 01:07:30.309
The Forum of Caesar and
Augustus at the top.

01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:33.820
And then you can see these
bases for the columns,

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:36.739
very close to the wall -- not
attached to it,

01:07:36.739 --> 01:07:39.630
but very close to the wall on
either side,

01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:41.480
because there's no space for
colonnades.

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:45.420
Here's a Google Earth image
showing the Imperial Fora,

01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:48.164
as it looks today,
part of the later Forum of

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:50.404
Trajan,
the Forum of Augustus,

01:07:50.404 --> 01:07:54.514
and what is preserved of the
so-called Forum Transitorium

01:07:54.514 --> 01:07:55.469
over here.
 

01:07:55.469 --> 01:07:58.806
This is a model of what the
Forum Transitorium would have

01:07:58.806 --> 01:08:01.070
looked like in ancient Roman
times,

01:08:01.070 --> 01:08:04.409
in the time of Domitian,
with the Temple of Minerva,

01:08:04.409 --> 01:08:07.010
with these columns on either
side.

01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:09.141
And you can see from this model
the difference that that makes,

01:08:09.141 --> 01:08:10.793
when you don't have enough
space to build covered

01:08:10.793 --> 01:08:11.309
colonnades.
 

01:08:11.309 --> 01:08:14.679
You've got columns that look
like they are projecting out of

01:08:14.679 --> 01:08:17.880
the wall, with projecting
entablatures on top of them.

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:21.029
We have not seen this before in
built architecture.

01:08:21.029 --> 01:08:22.840
This is a very important
development.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.524
We have seen it in painting but
we haven't seen it in built

01:08:25.524 --> 01:08:26.220
architecture.
 

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:28.788
Here's a detail of the Forum
Transitorium,

01:08:28.788 --> 01:08:32.319
with these columns placed
almost flush with the wall--

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:34.469
although not quite,
they project a little bit in

01:08:34.469 --> 01:08:36.235
front of the wall--
with the projecting

01:08:36.235 --> 01:08:36.828
entablatures.
 

01:08:36.828 --> 01:08:41.828
The walls made out of tufa
blocks, as you can see here.

01:08:41.828 --> 01:08:44.859
The rest with marble,
and a panel at the top;

01:08:44.859 --> 01:08:47.555
and we think there would've
been lots of such panels

01:08:47.555 --> 01:08:49.829
representing the goddess Minerva
herself.

01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:51.060
So we see that here.
 

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.483
We have not seen it in built
architecture before,

01:08:53.483 --> 01:08:55.198
but we have seen it in
painting.

01:08:55.198 --> 01:08:58.408
This is a detail of Cubiculum
16, in the Villa of the

01:08:58.408 --> 01:09:01.055
Mysteries,
and you can see one such set of

01:09:01.055 --> 01:09:03.380
columns that project out of the
wall,

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:06.479
with the projecting
entablatures up above.

01:09:06.479 --> 01:09:10.585
So it's something again that we
think may have been done in

01:09:10.585 --> 01:09:13.770
temporary wooden architecture,
for example.

01:09:13.770 --> 01:09:17.125
But keep in mind how early that
painting is--you all know the

01:09:17.125 --> 01:09:20.090
date of it, because you've
studied it for the exam;

01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:21.198
it's mid B.C.
 

01:09:21.198 --> 01:09:26.010
So it's way before even the
Augustan period,

01:09:26.010 --> 01:09:28.042
and yet we see that there,
and now we finally see it in

01:09:28.042 --> 01:09:30.597
built architecture,
and it's going to have a real

01:09:30.597 --> 01:09:33.996
history in Roman architecture in
a very different way than

01:09:33.996 --> 01:09:35.010
concrete does.
 

01:09:35.010 --> 01:09:38.244
This whole idea of decorating a
wall by placing a series of

01:09:38.244 --> 01:09:41.090
columns that project in and out
along that wall,

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:44.069
giving it a kind of--using the
traditional language of

01:09:44.069 --> 01:09:46.479
architecture,
columns, to create a kind of

01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:48.802
undulating wall,
or what we're going to call

01:09:48.802 --> 01:09:50.908
later in the semester a
"baroque"

01:09:50.908 --> 01:09:51.310
wall.
 

01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:54.792
Two details of one of the
surviving capitals,

01:09:54.792 --> 01:09:59.226
with the frieze up above,
a frieze that represents scenes

01:09:59.226 --> 01:10:02.194
of women weaving;
I'm not going to get into the

01:10:02.194 --> 01:10:03.770
meaning of all of that here
today.

01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:06.916
But you can see the way in
which the columns project

01:10:06.916 --> 01:10:09.939
somewhat out of the wall:
Corinthian capitals,

01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:13.609
projecting entablature,
very highly decorated,

01:10:13.609 --> 01:10:17.479
just like all of Flavian
architectural ornament,

01:10:17.479 --> 01:10:20.409
as you can see here,
very deeply drilled,

01:10:20.409 --> 01:10:23.038
and so on and so forth.
 

01:10:23.038 --> 01:10:26.010
But this whole idea of
decorating a wall in this way,

01:10:26.010 --> 01:10:28.184
and instilling movement in that
wall by this undulating

01:10:28.184 --> 01:10:30.795
in-and-out scheme,
is going to again have a very

01:10:30.795 --> 01:10:33.229
important future in Roman
architecture.

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:36.185
This is an interesting view
because it shows us just what

01:10:36.185 --> 01:10:38.827
we've looked at,
some of those remaining columns

01:10:38.827 --> 01:10:40.939
from the so-called Forum
Transitorium,

01:10:40.939 --> 01:10:44.855
which was renamed the Forum of
Nero after Domitian's death and

01:10:44.855 --> 01:10:46.590
damnatio memoriae.
 

01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:48.229
Nero just took it over and
said, "Okay,

01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:51.300
it's my forum now"
and renamed it to himself,

01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:53.920
but didn't add anything
architecturally to it.

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.109
We see it here.
 

01:10:55.109 --> 01:10:58.132
And this is one of those great
views in which you can see the

01:10:58.132 --> 01:11:01.460
difference between modern ground
level and ancient ground level.

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:03.480
In order to see the lower part
of the forum,

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.253
you've got to go right up to
the edge of the street and look

01:11:06.253 --> 01:11:06.960
down on it.
 

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:10.854
And this also an interesting
engraving by the famous artist

01:11:10.854 --> 01:11:14.550
Piranesi, a Piranesi print of
the eighteenth century.

01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:17.180
He did a lot of wonderful
prints.

01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:18.689
And if there's any interest in
this class,

01:11:18.689 --> 01:11:22.029
by the way, we have plenty of
these at Yale,

01:11:22.029 --> 01:11:23.939
and I know one of the teaching
fellows,

01:11:23.939 --> 01:11:27.091
if not more than one,
would be more than happy to

01:11:27.091 --> 01:11:31.032
find the time to take those of
you who might be interested in

01:11:31.032 --> 01:11:33.658
looking at Piranesi prints of
Rome,

01:11:33.658 --> 01:11:35.658
over to the British Art Center
and so on,

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:38.590
or elsewhere,
to take a look at these.

01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:42.649
But what's interesting about
this one is it shows where the

01:11:42.649 --> 01:11:46.359
ground level was at the time
that this was engraved by

01:11:46.359 --> 01:11:48.685
Piranesi;
that is, in the eighteenth

01:11:48.685 --> 01:11:51.189
century, it was pretty much
where it is here.

01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:54.692
It was much higher than it is
now, and then when they

01:11:54.692 --> 01:11:56.747
excavated it,
in modern times,

01:11:56.747 --> 01:12:00.289
they got us down to ancient
ground level and to the bottoms

01:12:00.289 --> 01:12:01.390
of the columns.
 

01:12:01.390 --> 01:12:03.488
I want to end up with this one
last image,

01:12:03.488 --> 01:12:08.069
because--very different,
very different--

01:12:08.069 --> 01:12:12.765
but it allows us to continue on
with a point that I made when we

01:12:12.765 --> 01:12:16.270
discussed the Colosseum,
and which has already turned up

01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:19.722
in the online forum,
and that is the use of Roman

01:12:19.722 --> 01:12:25.109
buildings as quarries for later
architects and later patrons,

01:12:25.109 --> 01:12:28.463
namely princes and popes,
and the way in which buildings

01:12:28.463 --> 01:12:31.939
like the Colosseum were pirated
for later architecture.

01:12:31.939 --> 01:12:34.680
In the case of the Forum
Transitorium,

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:37.738
or the Forum of Nerva,
we know that the Temple of

01:12:37.738 --> 01:12:40.003
Minerva,
that the material out of which

01:12:40.003 --> 01:12:42.057
it's made--
the reason that it does not

01:12:42.057 --> 01:12:45.015
exist at all today,
the Temple of Minerva,

01:12:45.015 --> 01:12:49.797
is that it was taken apart and
reused by Pope Paul V for a

01:12:49.797 --> 01:12:55.420
fountain that he wanted to build
on the Janiculum Hill in Rome,

01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:58.390
the so-called Acqua Paola,
which you see here.

01:12:58.390 --> 01:13:02.739
The Acqua Paola,
the temple was torn down in

01:13:02.739 --> 01:13:04.895
1606--
it still stood in 1606,

01:13:04.895 --> 01:13:08.175
it was torn down then--
and it was placed in this

01:13:08.175 --> 01:13:10.404
fountain,
or used for the construction of

01:13:10.404 --> 01:13:12.997
this fountain,
that was dedicated in 1612,

01:13:12.997 --> 01:13:16.109
and built by the architect
Giovanni Fontana.

01:13:16.109 --> 01:13:18.238
And you see it here.
 

01:13:18.238 --> 01:13:23.064
And it's not easy to determine
exactly which parts are from the

01:13:23.064 --> 01:13:24.310
temple itself.
 

01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:27.342
But much of the building stone
that you see here,

01:13:27.342 --> 01:13:30.376
reused in this fountain,
comes from the Temple of

01:13:30.376 --> 01:13:31.640
Minerva in Rome.
 

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:36.438
So it shows you again the way
in which these buildings were

01:13:36.438 --> 01:13:38.010
used as quarries.
 

01:13:38.010 --> 01:13:39.750
But the way in which Roman
buildings live on -- they either

01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:41.130
live on as themselves,
or they live on as other

01:13:41.130 --> 01:13:41.550
buildings.
 

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:44.850
And I think that's a nice
thought and a nice note on which

01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:45.720
to end today.
 

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:46.399
Thank you.

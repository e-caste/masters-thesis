00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.973
Prof: Now,
let us begin today with just

00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:11.602
some general issues that I think
are very pertinent to the

00:00:11.602 --> 00:00:14.960
reading of the Quixote.
 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:23.029
How significant is it that
the Quixote is written in

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.090
prose, not in verse?
 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.721
The prose, it is because it is
the prose of the world,

00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:33.740
of everyday life.
 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.980
Every day life is prosaic,
and this is the life that is

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.320
being depicted in the
Quixote.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.740
It is devoid of the order and
the rhythm of poetry.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.337
Hence the novel,
from now on,

00:00:49.337 --> 00:00:54.990
will be written in prose,
with exceptions.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.060
Remember my allusion in the
last lecture to the Divine

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.130
Comedy and the order of
the Divine Comedy,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.712
and that central line in the
very middle of the whole comedy

00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:16.631
alluding to Dante and the highly
structured nature of that poem

00:01:16.631 --> 00:01:21.430
down to the tercets and to every
line,

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.480
with its rhyme, with its meter.
 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.140
The same, of course,
is true of the Aeneid,

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.300
with its exquisite form and
shape.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.544
In the Quixote what is
represented is,

00:01:41.544 --> 00:01:43.860
I repeat, the prosaic.
 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.522
The prosaic is that which is
common and ordinary and not apt

00:01:49.522 --> 00:01:54.095
to be expressed in verse,
although there are,

00:01:54.095 --> 00:02:00.049
as you have seen,
in some episodes, bits of verse.

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:07.120
Now, another general issue
after the Marcela episode--

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.596
remember, when Don Quixote
interferes and doesn't allow

00:02:12.596 --> 00:02:16.449
anyone to chase her into the
woods--

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:23.800
we have to ponder if Don
Quixote is a hero.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.782
If he is, how does he differ
from Ulysses,

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:31.820
from Aeneis,
from the Cid,

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:39.235
from Roland and other heroes of
the preceding western literary

00:02:39.235 --> 00:02:41.180
tradition?
 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.979
Is he mostly a moral hero?
 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:52.008
This is something that we
should ponder as we continue to

00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:53.840
read the novel.
 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.855
And the last general issue that
I'd like to bring up is,

00:02:58.855 --> 00:03:01.409
again, the issue of irony.
 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:07.012
José Ortega y Gasset,
who was a very important

00:03:07.012 --> 00:03:10.169
Spanish philosopher of the
twentieth century,

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:15.568
the most important Spanish
philosopher of the twentieth

00:03:15.568 --> 00:03:20.058
century--
He's known in the English

00:03:20.058 --> 00:03:28.466
speaking world mostly for a book
called The Rebellion of the

00:03:28.466 --> 00:03:37.389
Masses,
and also for...

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.001
he has a very important book on
the Quixote,

00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:42.300
Meditations on the
Quixote,

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.410
and yet another that is even
better,

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.419
known than that called The
Dehumanization of Art,

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.960
which is about the avant-garde,
the art of the avant-garde--

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:02.228
He said: "Irony is instead
of saying what we think,

00:04:02.228 --> 00:04:07.038
we feign to think what we say.
 

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:12.657
Irony constitutes an unfolding
splitting up into two such as in

00:04:12.657 --> 00:04:16.100
the prologue of the
Quixote,

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.322
when the narrator splits into
two by creating the friend who

00:04:21.322 --> 00:04:23.269
comes to advise him.
 

00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:28.521
In irony there is this
splitting because there is a

00:04:28.521 --> 00:04:34.613
need of another who knows and
who understands the double

00:04:34.613 --> 00:04:37.029
entendre."
 

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:41.800
Irony can become sarcastic but
not in Cervantes.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.992
Cervantes's irony,
as you have all ready noticed,

00:04:45.992 --> 00:04:50.536
I'm sure, is mild and humorous
rather than cutting or

00:04:50.536 --> 00:04:51.759
sarcastic.
 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:59.988
The dialogue on which the book
depends so much is essentially

00:04:59.988 --> 00:05:03.824
ironic,
because we can see the errors

00:05:03.824 --> 00:05:08.329
of both protagonists as they
speak with each other,

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:10.899
errors that they point out to
each other.

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:13.939
In the case of Don Quixote,
as you will notice,

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:17.762
once and again he points out
the errors that Sancho makes in

00:05:17.762 --> 00:05:21.913
speaking,
but Sancho will also catch Don

00:05:21.913 --> 00:05:25.850
Quixote in a few mistakes
himself.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:33.004
Now, we move to one of my
favorite parts in the book which

00:05:33.004 --> 00:05:38.149
are the scenes in Juan
Palomeque's inn.

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:41.930
You have to remember the names
of these characters.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.420
His name is Juan Palomeque.
 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.779
I'm sure you did not quite
retain this name.

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:55.928
He is the innkeeper,
the most important innkeeper in

00:05:55.928 --> 00:06:00.629
the first part of the
Quixote.

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:04.225
Among the most famous and
important episodes in Don

00:06:04.225 --> 00:06:06.600
Quixote are those at his
inn.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.894
I have already spoken about the
importance of inns in the plot

00:06:10.894 --> 00:06:15.120
of the Quixote when
commenting upon the first inn,

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.470
in which Don Quixote was
knighted, if you remember.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.310
Karl Ludvig Seilig,
retired now,

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.250
Professor at Columbia
University, wrote:

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.514
"Formally,
structurally,

00:06:27.514 --> 00:06:31.394
thematically the inn is an
important focal point,

00:06:31.394 --> 00:06:35.600
a place of configurations and
conflations."

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.470
Inns in the Quixote or
in Cervantes are derived from

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.759
the picaresque tradition where
they figure very prominently,

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:50.035
in books like Lazarillo de
Tormes and Guzmán

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:52.911
de Alfarache,
that I have mentioned here

00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:53.750
several times.
 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:07:01.160
In those books,
the inns play a similar role.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.269
In fact, as we remarked,
the first innkeeper was a

00:07:06.269 --> 00:07:12.213
retired pícaro and he
tells with relish his life of

00:07:12.213 --> 00:07:17.836
picaresque adventures,
where he visited or stayed at

00:07:17.836 --> 00:07:23.259
the most notorious picaresque
emporia throughout Spain.

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:29.778
I also spoke of how inns
provide a kind of archaeology of

00:07:29.778 --> 00:07:32.680
society,
using that metaphor,

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.810
because characters from
different social classes and

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.079
professions meet in them.
 

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:43.999
The one run by Juan Palomeque
is, by far, the most important

00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:49.002
building in Part I of the
Quixote, even more important

00:07:49.002 --> 00:07:51.420
than Don Quixote's house.
 

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:56.170
In par two, there will be other
buildings, as you will discover.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:01.009
 
 

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:05.033
I, again, emphasize that it's
good to remember the names of

00:08:05.033 --> 00:08:08.295
these secondary characters,
like Juan Palomeque,

00:08:08.295 --> 00:08:11.350
who play significant roles in
the novel.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.829
They sometimes,
as I have all ready mentioned,

00:08:13.829 --> 00:08:17.170
have interesting names,
in some cases the names are

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.910
interesting because they're so
common,

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.990
as Pedro Alonso--remember?--the
neighbor who picks him up,

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:28.829
or Pero Pérez,
the priest,

00:08:28.829 --> 00:08:30.180
and so forth.
 

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.279
In the case of Juan Palomeque,
his last name has something to

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:37.648
do with pigeons;
'paloma' is a pigeon in

00:08:37.648 --> 00:08:38.678
Spanish.
 

00:08:38.678 --> 00:08:43.163
The '-eque' ending
doesn't sound very good,

00:08:43.163 --> 00:08:48.652
like '-ote' in Quixote,
Palomeque, so it's a last name

00:08:48.652 --> 00:08:50.940
that is mostly funny.
 

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:57.490
Now, if the road--as we have
come here,

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.450
as we have arrived at the inn
coming on the road--

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.769
was for the most part a sunny,
bright,

00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:07.230
realm, and this will change in
the episodes after the inn.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.720
The inn is in a kind of a
chiaroscuro--

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.519
I'm sure you've heard this
word, but I guess I'm determined

00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:19.190
to teach a lot of very pedantic
words that you can use in

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.833
further life,
even if you become a lawyer or

00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:23.820
something,
 

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:29.370
 
 

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.340
'chiaroscuro' in Italian
means 'bright dark';

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:37.023
it's a combination of darkness
and brightness,

00:09:37.023 --> 00:09:42.019
and it's normally associated
with Baroque art.

00:09:42.019 --> 00:09:47.470
And I will be speaking about
the Baroque in later lectures

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:52.250
because the cliché
is that the first part of

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.649
the Quixote is mostly
Renaissance,

00:09:56.649 --> 00:09:58.529
and the second part is Baroque.
 

00:09:58.529 --> 00:10:00.241
This is one of those
clichés,

00:10:00.241 --> 00:10:02.149
so I'll be talking about the
Baroque.

00:10:02.149 --> 00:10:05.918
But, so it is a dark place.
 

00:10:05.918 --> 00:10:11.450
In Juan Palomeque's inn,
people eat,

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:16.234
fight, have erotic encounters,
and live in very close

00:10:16.234 --> 00:10:19.046
proximity,
very close proximity,

00:10:19.046 --> 00:10:22.855
as you have noticed,
making for a great deal of

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:25.778
friction,
real and metaphoric,

00:10:25.778 --> 00:10:30.038
in this case,
as the characters rub against

00:10:30.038 --> 00:10:35.720
each other in the very confined
quarters of this inn.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:42.730
Now, at the inns the humor is
very theatrical,

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:47.899
they are like a stage--and,
in fact,

00:10:47.899 --> 00:10:52.067
in later episodes the inn will
become really a stage with

00:10:52.067 --> 00:10:56.279
characters coming in and out,
like actors on a

00:10:56.279 --> 00:11:02.230
stage--Theatrical in the sense
of slapstick comedy;

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:06.318
slapstick comedy,
because it's a comedy in which

00:11:06.318 --> 00:11:11.539
characters hit each other with
that stick that has a slap and

00:11:11.539 --> 00:11:15.629
makes it sound like it's a very
hard blow,

00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:18.379
you hit somebody--pow!--and it
sounds.

00:11:18.379 --> 00:11:20.879
It comes from the commedia
dell' arte.

00:11:20.879 --> 00:11:29.283
Commedia dell'arte was a
kind of Italian theater of the

00:11:29.283 --> 00:11:36.308
fifteenth century in which there
was no dialogue;

00:11:36.308 --> 00:11:39.601
the characters just slapped
each other, and kicked each

00:11:39.601 --> 00:11:41.980
other, and so forth,
and went around.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:48.080
The word in Spanish for
slapstick is very funny;

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.049
it's called
matapecados--I bet even

00:11:52.049 --> 00:11:57.956
the native speakers didn't know
that word--Matapecados,

00:11:57.956 --> 00:11:59.409
sin killer.
 

00:11:59.409 --> 00:12:04.210
 
 

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:08.254
It's a stick with which you hit
somebody else and--So,

00:12:08.254 --> 00:12:10.850
it's a slapstick kind of
comedy.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:16.892
This comedy involves physical
violence, mistaken identities

00:12:16.892 --> 00:12:19.080
and rowdy behavior.
 

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.966
In episodes such as these,
Cervantes displays his talent

00:12:23.966 --> 00:12:27.456
for comedy,
which he put to good use

00:12:27.456 --> 00:12:31.855
writing his very successful
entremeses or

00:12:31.855 --> 00:12:34.741
interludes--
Remember, the

00:12:34.741 --> 00:12:41.013
entremés is the
one-act funny play that is

00:12:41.013 --> 00:12:46.600
usually staged between acts of a
larger play--

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:53.830
Humor culminates in these
episodes,

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:58.986
when Don Quixote's imaginings
suddenly appear to mesh with

00:12:58.986 --> 00:13:04.960
what is happening in the tawdry
world in which he finds himself.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.850
He takes the innkeeper for a
nobleman in his castle,

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:13.080
as he did with the first inn,
and Maritornes as a damsel in

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.466
love with him,
when she is really an ugly

00:13:16.466 --> 00:13:20.100
prostitute on her way to meet
the carrier,

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.379
who happens to be lodging
there, too.

00:13:24.379 --> 00:13:33.610
The point seems to be that even
the rather concrete reality,

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:39.629
tangible reality of the inn can
be transformed by the characters

00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:43.073
needs,
desires, and imaginings,

00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:49.427
because this inn is as far as
possible from a castle and the

00:13:49.427 --> 00:13:55.672
characters as far as possible
from those in the romances of

00:13:55.672 --> 00:13:57.178
chivalry.
 

00:13:57.178 --> 00:14:02.510
Don Quixote's erotic desires
have been aroused by the

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.870
innkeeper's daughter.
 

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:09.823
Remember, the innkeeper has a
young daughter whom we imagine

00:14:09.823 --> 00:14:14.360
as a mere teenager and is
described in the text as,

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.700
quote: "a very comely
young maiden."

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:24.642
This episode is the most
explicit erotic display by Don

00:14:24.642 --> 00:14:33.288
Quixote in the entire book,
erotic in a sense of explicit

00:14:33.288 --> 00:14:39.908
sexuality,
is the most explicit in the

00:14:39.908 --> 00:14:41.970
whole book.
 

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.842
But more than anything the
episodes at the inn are an

00:14:45.842 --> 00:14:50.279
instance of the social,
being subverted by erotic

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:54.779
desire, that of the carrier and
Maritornes,

00:14:54.779 --> 00:14:57.759
as well as Don Quixote's.
 

00:14:57.759 --> 00:15:01.899
The ensuing violence involves
even the law,

00:15:01.899 --> 00:15:06.649
as the representative of the
Holy Brotherhood intervenes,

00:15:06.649 --> 00:15:09.994
and remember,
brings Don Quixote with a

00:15:09.994 --> 00:15:13.690
candleholder in the darkness of
the inn.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:17.330
What does this show?
 

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.393
Well, that the sublimated
eros of literary

00:15:20.393 --> 00:15:24.809
tradition has its counterpart,
perhaps it's real driving force

00:15:24.809 --> 00:15:29.355
on these unleashed erotic forces
that propel the characters to

00:15:29.355 --> 00:15:30.250
violence.
 

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:35.389
Cervantes is not moralizing
here, and he hardly ever does.

00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:39.000
All he seems to be doing is
showing the real,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.428
as it were, subconscious of
literature,

00:15:41.428 --> 00:15:44.822
the counterpart,
let's say, of the romances of

00:15:44.822 --> 00:15:48.298
chivalry and the pastoral,
what lurks underneath the

00:15:48.298 --> 00:15:50.308
romances of chivalry and the
pastoral.

00:15:50.308 --> 00:15:55.292
This is the reason for the
darkness, it represents all of

00:15:55.292 --> 00:15:59.029
these forces as opposed to the
pastoral.

00:15:59.029 --> 00:16:02.048
Pastoral literature always
occurs in daylight,

00:16:02.048 --> 00:16:09.028
and the eclogues--eclogues are
long poems on a pastoral theme,

00:16:09.028 --> 00:16:15.234
the most famous were by
Virgil--The time of an eclogue

00:16:15.234 --> 00:16:20.629
is the time span of a day,
so here it is the complete

00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:25.458
opposite;
the darkness revealing the real

00:16:25.458 --> 00:16:32.269
forces underneath those pastoral
poems, and so forth,

00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:36.460
and the romances of chivalry.
 

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:42.350
Now, let me go over the cast of
characters in Juan Palomeque's

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:42.928
inn.
 

00:16:42.928 --> 00:16:46.600
As you, I'm sure,
have noticed already,

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.279
Cervantes relishes in the
presentation of characters drawn

00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:56.532
from the lower strata of society
and tries to give a rounded view

00:16:56.532 --> 00:16:58.424
of them,
meaning that,

00:16:58.424 --> 00:17:03.059
along with their coarseness,
they often display kindness and

00:17:03.059 --> 00:17:04.910
human understanding.
 

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:09.090
These characters,
again, are drawn from the

00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:14.766
picaresque, but also drawn from
the extensive juridical or

00:17:14.766 --> 00:17:18.450
judicial documents of the
period.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:23.498
Spain generated a very
extensive judicial system in the

00:17:23.498 --> 00:17:28.826
sixteenth century with hundreds
and thousands of documents

00:17:28.826 --> 00:17:33.406
stored in archives about the
comings and goings of

00:17:33.406 --> 00:17:37.288
characters,
such as the ones we see here.

00:17:37.288 --> 00:17:43.210
But Cervantes,
as I always emphasize,

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:47.155
tries to give a rounded view of
these characters drawn from the

00:17:47.155 --> 00:17:50.529
lowest classes and also from the
criminal classes,

00:17:50.529 --> 00:17:55.630
rounded view showing that they
can be kind, also.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:59.742
And they are not stereotypes,
they are individuated or

00:17:59.742 --> 00:18:04.400
individualized by their moral
and their physical features.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.912
The best case is
Maritornes--Maritornes,

00:18:07.912 --> 00:18:12.145
the character about who I am
going to speak now,

00:18:12.145 --> 00:18:16.650
whom I hope whose name I hope
you will retain.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:24.150
I have mentioned her a couple
of times, and I want you to

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:31.382
remember her name from now
on--They all have individual

00:18:31.382 --> 00:18:36.740
features, physical as well as
moral.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.478
The first character is the
innkeeper Juan Palomeque,

00:18:40.478 --> 00:18:44.656
el Zurdo, the left-handed,
lefty--I'll speak about that in

00:18:44.656 --> 00:18:45.608
a minute.
 

00:18:45.608 --> 00:18:49.170
Remember, I told you to look
for details.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.019
This is a significant detail,
as you will see a little later.

00:18:52.019 --> 00:18:58.686
Look for details--his wife and
the daughter,

00:18:58.686 --> 00:19:04.269
that's the family running the
inn.

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:08.269
Number two, Maritornes.
 

00:19:08.269 --> 00:19:13.535
She is an Asturian wench,
meaning, who in spite of her

00:19:13.535 --> 00:19:18.798
profession is kind towards Don
Quixote and Sancho--

00:19:18.798 --> 00:19:22.336
Remember, that she gives him a
drink at the end when he's

00:19:22.336 --> 00:19:23.788
leaving and so forth.
 

00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:28.180
He's very kind of her--Notice
that she is from Asturias.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:33.492
There are maps of Spain on the
website and I have been urging

00:19:33.492 --> 00:19:38.009
you to use them so that you can
situate yourself.

00:19:38.009 --> 00:19:43.155
We have now met the Basque or
Biscainer, as Jarvis calls him,

00:19:43.155 --> 00:19:46.930
who's from the Basque
countries, remember?

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:51.986
I spoke about the Basques;
we met the Yanguesans,

00:19:51.986 --> 00:19:58.852
who were really from Galicia,
northwestern Spain,

00:19:58.852 --> 00:20:04.858
and here we have someone from
Asturias.

00:20:04.858 --> 00:20:10.246
The Galicians are of Celtic
origin, they're something like

00:20:10.246 --> 00:20:11.380
the Irish.
 

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:18.590
They play bagpipes like the
Irish--I hate bagpipes--but the

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:23.690
Galicians are known for their
bagpipes.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:29.962
I will speak more about the
Galicians as we go on--But

00:20:29.962 --> 00:20:35.644
Maritornes is from Asturias,
a northern province,

00:20:35.644 --> 00:20:38.250
a region of Spain.
 

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:44.700
They are very proud,
the Asturians,

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.578
because the Reconquest,
the war against the Moors,

00:20:48.578 --> 00:20:53.308
began in Asturias,
so they take great pride in

00:20:53.308 --> 00:20:55.759
that,
that it began right away,

00:20:55.759 --> 00:20:57.818
after the Moors occupied Spain.
 

00:20:57.818 --> 00:21:02.324
So the fact that she's Asturian
might be a joke on the part of

00:21:02.324 --> 00:21:06.682
Cervantes, they are very proud,
and here we have an Asturian

00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:07.788
prostitute.
 

00:21:07.788 --> 00:21:14.848
And Cervantes was obviously a
proud Castilian,

00:21:14.848 --> 00:21:24.440
and he has enough Castilians
who are not exactly beings,

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:29.630
being one to be proud of,
but he has a view,

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.053
a particular view,
of the people from various

00:21:32.053 --> 00:21:33.098
regions of Spain.
 

00:21:33.098 --> 00:21:38.900
So Maritornes is a wench from
Asturias.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.433
She takes pride in being
reliable in her professional

00:21:42.433 --> 00:21:43.930
dealings as a whore.
 

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.482
She keeps her dates,
in this case,

00:21:46.482 --> 00:21:48.650
with catastrophic results.
 

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:52.115
Though Maritornes is no
princess as Don Quixote

00:21:52.115 --> 00:21:56.109
imagines, she is responsible
within her profession and

00:21:56.109 --> 00:21:57.088
generous.
 

00:21:57.088 --> 00:22:00.130
Cervantes is not a moral
relativist,

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:05.373
but he has an understanding of
human frailty and the tumbles of

00:22:05.373 --> 00:22:08.342
individual fate--
If you read with care,

00:22:08.342 --> 00:22:11.561
you will have learned that
Maritornes is a prostitute

00:22:11.561 --> 00:22:14.657
because of a series of
misfortunes have brought her

00:22:14.657 --> 00:22:17.634
down,
not because she's inherently

00:22:17.634 --> 00:22:20.319
inclined to sin--
and as I have said,

00:22:20.319 --> 00:22:24.208
and I emphasized she is ethical
within the expectations of her

00:22:24.208 --> 00:22:25.608
trade she delivers.
 

00:22:25.608 --> 00:22:30.518
Cervantes also liked to show
how morality can be a code

00:22:30.518 --> 00:22:33.700
coherent within a given
context--

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.618
You will see this better in
Part II,

00:22:35.618 --> 00:22:38.779
when there is a gang of
outlaws, and within that gang,

00:22:38.779 --> 00:22:45.858
within its rules there are sets
of ethical behavior--

00:22:45.858 --> 00:22:49.277
In his own case,
as you have read the essay by

00:22:49.277 --> 00:22:52.240
Durán in the
Casebook,

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:57.175
which you should have by now,
you will know that the women in

00:22:57.175 --> 00:23:01.536
Cervantes's family because of
financial pressures were

00:23:01.536 --> 00:23:06.390
involved in questionable
activities at certain points--

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.999
and I do hope that you read
that very fine and succinct

00:23:09.999 --> 00:23:14.009
essay by Durán from which
I quoted a little bit in the

00:23:14.009 --> 00:23:18.020
last class emphasizing the fact
that Cervantes was an insider

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.028
and outsider at the same time in
Spain.

00:23:21.028 --> 00:23:25.612
Now, I'm going down the list of
characters at the inn:

00:23:25.612 --> 00:23:28.872
the carrier,
a muleteer, who happens to be

00:23:28.872 --> 00:23:31.282
an acquaintance,
or even a relative,

00:23:31.282 --> 00:23:37.431
of Cide Hamete Benengeli,
the alleged author of this

00:23:37.431 --> 00:23:38.630
story.
 

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:42.848
It's another instance of
Cervantes's self reflexivity.

00:23:42.848 --> 00:23:46.190
Here we have a character who is
related to the real author.

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:51.413
Now, it is true that
Moriscos--fellows of Moorish

00:23:51.413 --> 00:23:55.111
origins--
tended to be carriers like

00:23:55.111 --> 00:23:59.452
this, but Cervantes is making,
again, another hilarious

00:23:59.452 --> 00:24:02.506
connection between the fictional
and the real worlds of his

00:24:02.506 --> 00:24:02.980
novel.
 

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:07.150
Now, going down the list of
these characters--

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:09.220
and I'm doing this as this had
been a play,

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.455
because, as I said,
the inn is very much like a

00:24:12.455 --> 00:24:15.467
stage--
there is an officer from the

00:24:15.467 --> 00:24:18.608
ancient Holy Brotherhood of
Toledo,

00:24:18.608 --> 00:24:21.531
who represents the law,
and he's the one who hits Don

00:24:21.531 --> 00:24:23.950
Quixote on the head with a
candleholder,

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:29.522
and I explained in the last
class what the Holy Brotherhood

00:24:29.522 --> 00:24:31.630
is,
or was at the time,

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:37.356
and it plays an important role,
because it is the police force

00:24:37.356 --> 00:24:41.548
that is pursuing Don Quixote and
Sancho.

00:24:41.548 --> 00:24:44.392
Now, finally,
there are Pedro Martínez

00:24:44.392 --> 00:24:48.503
and Tenorio Hernández,
who are among the rowdies who

00:24:48.503 --> 00:24:52.523
participate in Sancho's blanket
tossing at the end of this

00:24:52.523 --> 00:24:53.298
episode.
 

00:24:53.298 --> 00:24:57.431
You remember when they go out
and toss Sancho on a blanket,

00:24:57.431 --> 00:25:01.207
a practice that was mostly
reserved for animals during

00:25:01.207 --> 00:25:02.490
carnival time.
 

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:06.558
They would do it to poor dogs,
to blanket toss them like that.

00:25:06.558 --> 00:25:10.170
A point to consider is that
these are rowdies,

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:13.460
but not inherently evil
characters--again,

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.430
in spite of their social
station.

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:19.310
Notice, again,
the very common name Pedro

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:22.579
Martínez,
who happens not to be the

00:25:22.579 --> 00:25:26.230
current pitcher for the
Philadelphia Phillies,

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:32.230
formerly with the Boston Red
Socks and the New York Mets,

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:36.029
he is the Dominican pitcher
who's now making a comeback with

00:25:36.029 --> 00:25:39.830
the Philadelphia Phillies and
who happened to be named Pedro

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.118
Martínez.
 

00:25:41.118 --> 00:25:44.421
Being named Pedro
Martínez is like being

00:25:44.421 --> 00:25:49.378
called Peter Smith in English,
so it's not unlikely that this

00:25:49.378 --> 00:25:53.875
coincidence would happen,
but whenever I get to this

00:25:53.875 --> 00:25:58.460
episode I mention this and
wonder how many baseball fans

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.843
there are in the crowd,
because I am,

00:26:01.843 --> 00:26:05.753
as you probably know,
a baseball fan and also a

00:26:05.753 --> 00:26:09.028
writer, I write on baseball,
and so forth.

00:26:09.028 --> 00:26:11.319
In any case,
this Pedro Martínez is

00:26:11.319 --> 00:26:13.500
the not the pitcher for the
Phillies.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:20.210
He is a rowdy who participates
in this blanket tossing of poor

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:21.200
Sancho.
 

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:27.037
Now, these characters,
like Don Quixote himself,

00:26:27.037 --> 00:26:32.130
tend to have physical defects
or scars.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:36.588
The source here,
if there has to be a specific

00:26:36.588 --> 00:26:41.203
source is La Celestina--
Remember, the work that I have

00:26:41.203 --> 00:26:45.179
mentioned several times,
in which the protagonist is an

00:26:45.179 --> 00:26:52.066
old whore and goâ€“between,
who has an ugly scar on her

00:26:52.066 --> 00:26:52.910
face.
 

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:58.545
The faces of these characters
are scarred by time,

00:26:58.545 --> 00:27:01.880
by temperament,
by profession,

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:06.019
by crimes, by illness,
by class.

00:27:06.019 --> 00:27:11.920
In this, Cervantes is also very
much like Velázquez;

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.769
he finds beauty in the ugly,
and this is very much a part of

00:27:16.769 --> 00:27:20.880
the modernity of Cervantes and
Velázquez.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.826
He finds beauty in the ugly,
the deformed,

00:27:25.826 --> 00:27:30.598
even the monstrous;
and some of Velázquez's

00:27:30.598 --> 00:27:34.480
characters and Cervantes's
characters are monsters.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.997
These characters have features
that make them apt to be

00:27:38.997 --> 00:27:42.008
displayed, to be seen,
to be admired,

00:27:42.008 --> 00:27:45.019
like Velázquez's
midgets.

00:27:45.019 --> 00:27:52.834
And so, I have asked Elena to
provide us with some examples of

00:27:52.834 --> 00:27:56.548
Velázquez's midgets.
 

00:27:56.548 --> 00:27:58.858
I am not going to remember
their names.

00:27:58.858 --> 00:28:02.068
Is that clear enough,
or should I lower the curtains?

00:28:02.068 --> 00:28:06.996
As you can see,
Velázquez has painted

00:28:06.996 --> 00:28:12.288
this midget with a book,
so that you can see the

00:28:12.288 --> 00:28:15.411
relative size,
as I mentioned in the last

00:28:15.411 --> 00:28:15.838
class.
 

00:28:15.838 --> 00:28:20.450
He's very tiny,
indeed, and that physical

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:27.019
feature is that which makes him
a specific individual,

00:28:27.019 --> 00:28:30.660
and it is that deformity that
makes him interesting,

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:36.670
esthetically interesting.
 

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:38.338
These are others.
 

00:28:38.338 --> 00:28:39.938
Some of them have,
as the one in Las

00:28:39.938 --> 00:28:43.840
Meninas,
and will it see in a minute,

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:50.968
a kind of an air of idiocy on
their faces as if they were also

00:28:50.968 --> 00:28:52.369
retarded.
 

00:28:52.369 --> 00:28:54.430
Next.
 

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:56.910
This one, I think,
is the most famous one and do

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:58.809
you remember the name of this
one?

00:28:58.809 --> 00:29:00.650
I had the name.
 

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:04.698
Yes, I think this one is El
Niño de Vallecas or

00:29:04.698 --> 00:29:07.058
Sebastián de
Morra.

00:29:07.058 --> 00:29:08.700
Student:  Morra.
 

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.838
El de Vallecas viene despues.
 

00:29:10.838 --> 00:29:15.383
Prof: Yes,
these are characters in the

00:29:15.383 --> 00:29:16.210
court.
 

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:20.539
They were used for
entertainment and for amusement.

00:29:20.539 --> 00:29:23.108
Next.
 

00:29:23.108 --> 00:29:26.743
Yes, this one has,
you can see,

00:29:26.743 --> 00:29:30.500
an air of idiocy in his face.
 

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.420
Next.
 

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:36.305
All right, and then we get to
Las Meninas,

00:29:36.305 --> 00:29:40.920
back to Las Meninas,
with that flat round face,

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.942
and that gesture,
and that face of sort of

00:29:43.942 --> 00:29:46.510
idiocy,
I wonder if even Down's

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:49.140
Syndrome or something like that.
 

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:56.007
Such characters can and were
turned into spectacles for

00:29:56.007 --> 00:30:00.901
amusement as is done,
by the way, with Don Quixote in

00:30:00.901 --> 00:30:04.048
several episodes because of
their peculiar features.

00:30:04.048 --> 00:30:07.950
It is their defects that make
them esthetically valuable and

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.618
different,
but Velázquez was a

00:30:10.618 --> 00:30:14.376
master at showing individuals
features and suggesting a

00:30:14.376 --> 00:30:18.970
relationship between these and
the personality of his subjects.

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:23.961
He did this even in the
portraits of kings--I think I

00:30:23.961 --> 00:30:29.434
mentioned in the last class,
some of these Hapsburgs had a

00:30:29.434 --> 00:30:35.152
large jaw;
because of inbreeding in these

00:30:35.152 --> 00:30:42.001
lines such features were
emphasized genetically,

00:30:42.001 --> 00:30:46.519
and so he did not stop at...
 

00:30:46.519 --> 00:30:49.960
and he would paint the kings
like that.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:53.102
It is the same as Cervantes's
penchant to characterize based

00:30:53.102 --> 00:30:55.019
on peculiarities of body and
mind.

00:30:55.019 --> 00:30:59.634
Don Quixote is thin and
cerebral, Sancho is fat and

00:30:59.634 --> 00:31:00.650
physical.
 

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:03.493
Each, however,
is mental or cerebral or

00:31:03.493 --> 00:31:05.890
physical, in a particular way.
 

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:08.778
But while focusing on these
ugly characters,

00:31:08.778 --> 00:31:13.407
let us not forget Marcela's
perfect beauty and that of other

00:31:13.407 --> 00:31:17.410
young women and men about to
appear in the novel.

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:21.736
These follows models of beauty
derived from Renaissance art,

00:31:21.736 --> 00:31:25.108
which in turn derived from
classical models.

00:31:25.108 --> 00:31:28.618
Think of Botticelli's Venus,
and The Primavera,

00:31:28.618 --> 00:31:33.298
variety is the norm in the
Quixote with frequent

00:31:33.298 --> 00:31:38.150
contrast between extreme
ugliness and stunning beauty.

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:41.654
You will find this in
characters such as Dorotea,

00:31:41.654 --> 00:31:46.108
that are about to appear in
this central part of the novel.

00:31:46.108 --> 00:31:50.644
At the inn, the first character
with a physical defect is Juan

00:31:50.644 --> 00:31:53.618
Palomeque himself,
who is left-handed.

00:31:53.618 --> 00:31:58.390
Until very recently,
left-handedness was considered

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:04.305
a defect, and in school children
were forced to use their right

00:32:04.305 --> 00:32:05.259
hands.
 

00:32:05.259 --> 00:32:09.602
My Basque maternal grandfather
was left-handed,

00:32:09.602 --> 00:32:13.000
and he was forced,
physically forced,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.400
to use his right hand in
school;

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.960
otherwise he would be beaten.
 

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.402
And when he went home to do his
homework he would do it

00:32:21.402 --> 00:32:24.907
left-handed, which is more
comfortable, and as a result,

00:32:24.907 --> 00:32:27.140
he could write with both hands.
 

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:28.960
But I'm trying to emphasize
that because now,

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:33.166
of course, we are very far from
thinking that left-handedness is

00:32:33.166 --> 00:32:38.700
a physical defect--
How many left-handers here?

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.960
You are a real minority.
 

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:50.318
It's okay--But,
of course, now it's common.

00:32:50.318 --> 00:32:53.752
I have relatives who are
left-handed and so forth,

00:32:53.752 --> 00:32:57.468
but the most remarkable
character in terms of physical

00:32:57.468 --> 00:32:59.220
traits is Maritornes.
 

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:03.429
Her name, by the way,
could suggest an inversion of

00:33:03.429 --> 00:33:07.217
virginity, or the opposite of
virginity, Mari,

00:33:07.217 --> 00:33:11.088
Maria, Virgin Mary,
-tornes, turns around.

00:33:11.088 --> 00:33:16.049
Maritornes would be the reverse
of a virgin.

00:33:16.049 --> 00:33:18.778
She's, in fact, a whore.
 

00:33:18.778 --> 00:33:21.500
Let me read the descriptions of
Maritornes.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.730
First, on page one-eleven of
your book:

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.920
"There was also a servant
in the inn,

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.858
an Asturian wench,
broad-faced,

00:33:28.858 --> 00:33:31.230
flat-headed,
and saddle-nosed,

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:35.460
with one eye squinting,
and the other not much better.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:39.048
It is true, the gracefulness of
her body [I changed that word

00:33:39.048 --> 00:33:41.801
from the translation]
made amends for her other

00:33:41.801 --> 00:33:42.519
defects.
 

00:33:42.519 --> 00:33:46.730
She was not seven hands high
from her feet to her head;

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:49.269
and her shoulders,
which burdened her a little too

00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:52.224
much, made her look down to the
ground more than she cared

00:33:52.224 --> 00:33:52.900
to."
 

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.740
Remember, again,
the midget in Las Meninas,

00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:00.402
that we just saw;
the face is broad,

00:34:00.402 --> 00:34:04.476
flat, the nose deformed,
her being stooped or

00:34:04.476 --> 00:34:07.200
hunchbacked suggests her being
inclined,

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.539
literally, to the ground,
to the base,

00:34:09.539 --> 00:34:12.780
to that which is low,
not to the heights.

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:18.030
Her defective eyes had a touch
of grotesqueness,

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:24.545
but also signals limitations in
perception that are at the core

00:34:24.545 --> 00:34:28.960
of what happens at the inn in
the dark,

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.420
when they can't see each other
very well.

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:35.960
These are only her physical
attributes.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:41.619
Later, when Don Quixote seizes
Maritornes we get the rest of

00:34:41.619 --> 00:34:46.458
the picture on pages 114-115:
"Thus she encountered Don

00:34:46.458 --> 00:34:49.309
Quixote's arms,
[she being Maritornes],

00:34:49.309 --> 00:34:52.768
who caught fast hold of her by
the wrist,

00:34:52.768 --> 00:34:56.690
and pulling her towards him,
she not daring to speak a word,

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:59.449
made her sit down on the bed by
him.

00:34:59.449 --> 00:35:02.295
Presently he felt to feeling
her smock, which,

00:35:02.295 --> 00:35:05.458
though it was of canvas,
seemed to him to be of the

00:35:05.458 --> 00:35:07.230
finest and softest lawn.
 

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:10.190
She had on her wrist a string
of glass beads;

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:13.590
but to his fancy they were
precious oriental pearls.

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:16.746
Her hairs, not unlike those of
a horse's mane,

00:35:16.746 --> 00:35:20.322
he took for threads of the
brightest gold of Arabia,

00:35:20.322 --> 00:35:23.969
whose splendour obscures that
of the sun itself.

00:35:23.969 --> 00:35:27.402
And though her breath,
doubtless, smelled of last

00:35:27.402 --> 00:35:30.905
night's salt fish,
he fancied himself sucking from

00:35:30.905 --> 00:35:33.980
her lips a delicious and
aromatic odor.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:37.864
In short, he painted her in his
imagination in the very form and

00:35:37.864 --> 00:35:40.639
manner he had read described in
his books,

00:35:40.639 --> 00:35:43.030
of some princes,
who comes, adorned in the

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:45.079
manner here mentioned,
to visit the

00:35:45.079 --> 00:35:47.690
dangerously-wounded knight with
whom she is in love.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.559
And so great was the poor
gentleman's infatuation,

00:35:50.559 --> 00:35:53.369
that neither the touch,
nor the breath,

00:35:53.369 --> 00:35:56.139
nor other things the good wench
had about her,

00:35:56.139 --> 00:36:00.699
could undeceive him,
though enough to make anyone

00:36:00.699 --> 00:36:03.360
but a carrier vomit."
 

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:08.018
Now, we move here to a kind of
phenomenology of ugliness,

00:36:08.018 --> 00:36:10.789
how does it feel,
how does one perceive ugliness,

00:36:10.789 --> 00:36:15.405
of the repulsive,
as Maritornes more contingent

00:36:15.405 --> 00:36:19.920
and secondary characteristics
are itemized.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.746
The reader is given this chance
features depending on what she

00:36:24.746 --> 00:36:28.940
wore and how she smelled on that
particular night,

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:32.969
and what here breath was like,
owing to her last meal.

00:36:32.969 --> 00:36:38.121
The phrase: "the other
things good wench had about

00:36:38.121 --> 00:36:42.891
her" is a polite
circumlocution a periphrastic

00:36:42.891 --> 00:36:48.518
way of sparing the reader of
further probably more revolting

00:36:48.518 --> 00:36:49.760
traits.
 

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:55.559
That's what that phrase stands
for there.

00:36:55.559 --> 00:36:58.782
The aesthetics of the ugly and
repulsive is very much

00:36:58.782 --> 00:37:02.842
contingent on temporality,
on the passing time that wears

00:37:02.842 --> 00:37:07.369
down bodies and endows them with
undesirable though temporary

00:37:07.369 --> 00:37:08.349
qualities.
 

00:37:08.349 --> 00:37:11.369
Deformities are contingent
individuating,

00:37:11.369 --> 00:37:14.266
particularizing,
in contrast to perfect models

00:37:14.266 --> 00:37:16.474
that are timeless--
Contingency,

00:37:16.474 --> 00:37:20.887
by the way, since I'm using the
word a lot: that may or may not

00:37:20.887 --> 00:37:23.518
happen,
possible, happening by chance,

00:37:23.518 --> 00:37:25.831
accidental,
fortuitous, conditional,

00:37:25.831 --> 00:37:28.289
these are definitions of
contingency--

00:37:28.289 --> 00:37:33.248
This is the aesthetic
counterpart of the statement by

00:37:33.248 --> 00:37:35.826
Don Quixote,
when he's mauled by the

00:37:35.826 --> 00:37:37.570
windmills that he took for
giants.

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:39.730
Everything is subject to change.
 

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:44.579
It is the realm mischievous
enchanters that alter things,

00:37:44.579 --> 00:37:47.880
like walling up his library and
turning this damsel,

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.730
this beautiful princess that he
thinks he's holding,

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:54.010
into this repulsive whore.
 

00:37:54.010 --> 00:38:01.420
Don Quixote mistakes to apply
the model of beauty,

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.389
the Renaissance blonde model of
beauty,

00:38:03.389 --> 00:38:08.179
which is blonde and beautiful
young woman,

00:38:08.179 --> 00:38:10.480
to the grotesque Maritornes.
 

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.077
His mistake reveals,
however, that what he passes

00:38:14.077 --> 00:38:16.849
off as sublime love is really
lust.

00:38:16.849 --> 00:38:20.893
The episode lays bare
appropriately in the middle of

00:38:20.893 --> 00:38:25.809
the night, and in total darkness
Don Quixote's subconscious.

00:38:25.809 --> 00:38:29.099
We should not miss the point
that as a prostitute,

00:38:29.099 --> 00:38:33.000
an embodiment of lust,
Maritornes is the opposite of

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.130
what one would normally consider
sexually desirable.

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:43.010
We are here at the lowest point
of love, at its basest.

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:47.030
So the episodes at Juan
Palomeque's inn,

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:50.672
fraught with erotic violence
and culminating with Don Quixote

00:38:50.672 --> 00:38:53.889
and Sancho's violent bowel
movements and vomiting,

00:38:53.889 --> 00:38:57.699
are like a phantasmagoria in
which the basic,

00:38:57.699 --> 00:39:02.467
the most basic drives behind
the protagonists' actions are

00:39:02.467 --> 00:39:04.139
staged as it were.
 

00:39:04.139 --> 00:39:08.429
They are reduced to their
oral-- these characters,

00:39:08.429 --> 00:39:10.719
these protagonists--are reduced
to their oral,

00:39:10.719 --> 00:39:15.463
anal and even genital stages,
if we're going to use Freudian

00:39:15.463 --> 00:39:19.873
terminology;
they are reduced to that basic

00:39:19.873 --> 00:39:20.639
level.
 

00:39:20.639 --> 00:39:24.204
Don Quixote's desire for the
innkeeper's daughter shows his

00:39:24.204 --> 00:39:26.911
physical desires,
which are surely behind his

00:39:26.911 --> 00:39:28.940
transforming Aldonza Lorenzo.
 

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:33.076
Aldonza Lorenzo,
remember, is the young woman

00:39:33.076 --> 00:39:38.530
near Don Quixote's village that
he turns into Dulcinea,

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:45.789
so we see what is behind that
turning Aldonza into the sublime

00:39:45.789 --> 00:39:47.099
Dulcinea.
 

00:39:47.099 --> 00:39:49.579
Aldonza is not ugly,
as we will see.

00:39:49.579 --> 00:39:52.750
She is a brawny, but attractive.
 

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:57.451
Don Quixote's lust for her is
typical of an upper class older

00:39:57.451 --> 00:40:00.349
gentleman for a lower class
woman,

00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:06.603
whom he considers sexier and
more sexual than women of his

00:40:06.603 --> 00:40:08.250
social class.
 

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:12.157
Spanish literature is full of
situations in which a lustful

00:40:12.157 --> 00:40:15.190
aristocrat tries to ravage a
peasant woman;

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:17.150
all of European literature is
full of this.

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:21.208
Don Juan, of the famous Don
Juan tradition is such a case,

00:40:21.208 --> 00:40:25.266
but there are others that I
will mention during the course

00:40:25.266 --> 00:40:26.690
of the semester.
 

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:31.364
Don Quixote's and Sancho's
bodily evacuations provoked by

00:40:31.364 --> 00:40:36.373
Fierabras's balsam dramatized
the violent forces behind their

00:40:36.373 --> 00:40:38.460
basic drives to live.
 

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:44.262
Remember that Don Quixote
claims to have the recipe or the

00:40:44.262 --> 00:40:49.338
prescription for this balsam,
that he learned in the romances

00:40:49.338 --> 00:40:52.920
of chivalry that if you drink it
will make you whole again,

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:56.460
even if you have been sliced or
cut in two.

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:59.353
You drink the balsam and,
boom!, you're made whole again,

00:40:59.353 --> 00:41:00.130
you're cured.
 

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:02.860
And he asks for the
ingredients, and he makes it,

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:11.003
and they drink it and,
of course, the results are

00:41:11.003 --> 00:41:15.152
horrendous,
because both Don Quixote and

00:41:15.152 --> 00:41:18.380
Sancho have violent bowel
movements and vomiting,

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:19.739
and all of that.
 

00:41:19.739 --> 00:41:24.010
This is particularly so with
Sancho,

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:26.478
who, by the way,
will defecate again soon out of

00:41:26.478 --> 00:41:29.273
fear--
if you have gotten to that nice

00:41:29.273 --> 00:41:31.800
episode with the fulling-hammer.
 

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:35.875
But note that the balsam is
supposed to restore their bodies

00:41:35.875 --> 00:41:38.570
to make their physiques whole
again,

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:42.099
erasing the ravages of violence
and,

00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:44.699
more broadly, of time.
 

00:41:44.699 --> 00:41:48.570
The balsam would erase those
ugly physical features or scars

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:50.079
that identified them.
 

00:41:50.079 --> 00:41:53.460
Here, the balsam stands for
something that would erase those

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:56.210
marks on their bodies,
the marks that I have been

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:57.300
speaking about.
 

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:01.260
Excreting is a mock form of
purification,

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:07.199
a rejection of the material
world that they have ingested.

00:42:07.199 --> 00:42:11.300
Ironically, Don Quixote does
get better;

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:15.730
perhaps, medically speaking,
he needed to be cleansed out,

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:22.164
and so taking this which turns
out to be a violent laxative

00:42:22.164 --> 00:42:28.570
makes him feel better,
but Sancho almost dies,

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:34.409
because he vomits and has
diarrhea,

00:42:34.409 --> 00:42:37.349
and everything that you saw
there.

00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:43.090
I will return to this unsavory
topic soon.

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:48.779
Now, the flimsy construction of
Juan Palomeque's inn leads us to

00:42:48.779 --> 00:42:53.293
a topic that I have mentioned
several times before:

00:42:53.293 --> 00:42:56.630
improvisation,
evident in Velázquez's

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:57.786
gesture--
He's improvising,

00:42:57.786 --> 00:43:01.532
he's going to paint--
and discussed at length in the

00:43:01.532 --> 00:43:04.010
prologue to Don Quixote.
 

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:08.916
Juan Palomeque's inn is the
most important building in Part

00:43:08.916 --> 00:43:15.175
I and is an internal emblem,
I think, of the book's careless

00:43:15.175 --> 00:43:21.152
genesis and structure,
or its deliberately careless

00:43:21.152 --> 00:43:23.750
genesis and structure.
 

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:27.840
I'm equating here the inn and
its construction with the

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.250
composition of the book Don
Quixote.

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:36.047
The inn is the one shelter the
protagonists do find repeatedly

00:43:36.047 --> 00:43:38.585
in Part I,
but they enjoy no protection or

00:43:38.585 --> 00:43:41.597
peace within its walls,
because it is so dilapidated

00:43:41.597 --> 00:43:44.599
that it barely keeps them out of
the elements.

00:43:44.599 --> 00:43:49.514
It is not a meaningful and
fulfilling end to the road,

00:43:49.514 --> 00:43:51.369
but a way station.
 

00:43:51.369 --> 00:43:55.391
That is, is not a home to
return to, and it's meaningful,

00:43:55.391 --> 00:43:58.478
and it shelters them,
and gives them solace,

00:43:58.478 --> 00:43:59.699
and so forth.
 

00:43:59.699 --> 00:44:03.512
It is just a way station,
its parts are in a sorry state

00:44:03.512 --> 00:44:07.739
of disrepair and do not match
harmoniously with each other.

00:44:07.739 --> 00:44:13.780
The camaranchón
is the word in the Spanish in

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:15.134
the original.
 

00:44:15.134 --> 00:44:20.427
It's camaranchón,
in the original,

00:44:20.427 --> 00:44:24.860
or attic, where Don Quixote's
bed is set up:

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:30.527
"gave evident tokens of
having formerly served many

00:44:30.527 --> 00:44:33.619
years as a hayloft."
 

00:44:33.619 --> 00:44:37.099
Sebastián de
Covarrubias,

00:44:37.099 --> 00:44:40.070
whom you must remember from my
earlier lectures--

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:43.972
remember the lexicographer who
wrote the first dictionary of

00:44:43.972 --> 00:44:47.677
the Spanish language and
published it in 1610-- says that

00:44:47.677 --> 00:44:50.590
'camaranchón' is
derived,

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:53.360
obviously from the Latin
'camera,' chamber,

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:58.050
and it's a disparaging term for
the highest spot in a house,

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:01.896
an attic or loft,
where old junk heterogeneous by

00:45:01.896 --> 00:45:04.139
its very nature is stored.
 

00:45:04.139 --> 00:45:08.195
This the reason the stars can
be seen through the gaps on his

00:45:08.195 --> 00:45:11.454
flimsy roof,
which is why it is called in

00:45:11.454 --> 00:45:14.101
the Spanish an
"estrellado

00:45:14.101 --> 00:45:17.150
establo"
or starlit loft,

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:20.909
that is, if you think of the
inn like this,

00:45:20.909 --> 00:45:24.590
the camaranchón
would be here.

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:28.210
So, from the inside,
you could see the roof,

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:33.650
which has holes,
and it's starry because you can

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:37.635
see through the roof,
the holes in the roof,

00:45:37.635 --> 00:45:40.050
you can see it's a very
primitive drawing,

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:43.949
but you can see through its
roof, you can see the stars.

00:45:43.949 --> 00:45:47.625
This suggests that the inn was
originally a small house to

00:45:47.625 --> 00:45:50.268
which additions were made
haphazardly,

00:45:50.268 --> 00:45:53.356
incorporating the stable and
it's hayloft to its living

00:45:53.356 --> 00:45:55.929
quarters to accommodate more
paying guests.

00:45:55.929 --> 00:46:01.036
Also, a roof so full of holes
that the stars are visible from

00:46:01.036 --> 00:46:06.570
within comically suggests that
the inn has cosmic connections,

00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:10.420
as did Greek,
Roman and Aztec temples,

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:14.222
as well as the Renaissance
counterparts by the alignment to

00:46:14.222 --> 00:46:15.469
celestial bodies.
 

00:46:15.469 --> 00:46:18.579
In other words,
in Classical architecture,

00:46:18.579 --> 00:46:23.648
in Aztec architecture,
the temples were aligned to the

00:46:23.648 --> 00:46:26.851
stars,
to the constellations,

00:46:26.851 --> 00:46:32.920
so that the building would be
part of this cosmic world.

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.130
Do you understand what I'm
trying to say?

00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:36.599
The buildings were aligned in
such a way.

00:46:36.599 --> 00:46:41.128
Also, such a star spangled
ceiling would be nature's

00:46:41.128 --> 00:46:46.099
counterpart to the elaborate
ones of certain palaces,

00:46:46.099 --> 00:46:53.300
in which zodiac signs were
often depicted in the roof.

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:57.648
Which is the closest example we
have to that today,

00:46:57.648 --> 00:47:02.778
those of us who live in the
northeast, that we see it all of

00:47:02.778 --> 00:47:03.909
the time?
 

00:47:03.909 --> 00:47:05.659
Student: Grand Central.
 

00:47:05.659 --> 00:47:07.360
Prof: Grand Central
Station!

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.500
The next time you go to Grand
Central Station,

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.994
look up--not too long,
or they might take your

00:47:11.994 --> 00:47:13.581
wallet--
but look up,

00:47:13.581 --> 00:47:18.393
and you will see that the roof
has drawn on it all of the

00:47:18.393 --> 00:47:19.940
constellations.
 

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:25.380
It is as if there were no roof,
as if you could see actually

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:31.099
the stars, and that is a device
used in Renaissance palaces.

00:47:31.099 --> 00:47:35.639
And so, it is an ironic
allusion to it,

00:47:35.639 --> 00:47:42.329
that the roof of this very
humble building is starlit.

00:47:42.329 --> 00:47:46.420
Against the background of the
inns ramshackle improvised

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:49.239
architecture,
such illusions are hilarious,

00:47:49.239 --> 00:47:52.164
and highlight that it is no
architectural jewel built

00:47:52.164 --> 00:47:54.920
following a careful plan and
classical models.

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:57.920
It would seem as if during its
construction,

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.199
which was gradual and ruled by
chance,

00:48:00.199 --> 00:48:04.018
everything in it has been
transformed by contingency--

00:48:04.018 --> 00:48:06.849
there is contingency again--and
the passage of time.

00:48:06.849 --> 00:48:08.849
"Many years"
it says in the quote that I

00:48:08.849 --> 00:48:09.300
read you.
 

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:12.594
The provisional nature of its
furnishings is evident in Don

00:48:12.594 --> 00:48:14.496
Quixote's bed,
which, quote:

00:48:14.496 --> 00:48:18.679
"consisted of four not
very smooth boards upon two not

00:48:18.679 --> 00:48:20.554
very equal trestles".
 

00:48:20.554 --> 00:48:21.420
Unquote.
 

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:23.233
Predictably,
during the free for all

00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:25.719
provoked by Maritornes nocturnal
appointment,

00:48:25.719 --> 00:48:29.268
the mule driver climbs on it
and makes it collapse,

00:48:29.268 --> 00:48:32.358
quote: "the bed which was
a little feeble and its

00:48:32.358 --> 00:48:35.621
foundations not of the strongest
being unable to bear the

00:48:35.621 --> 00:48:39.001
additional weight of the carrier
came down with them to the

00:48:39.001 --> 00:48:40.110
ground."
 

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:41.469
You remember that scene,
I'm sure.

00:48:41.469 --> 00:48:45.893
The improvised patchwork
architecture of Palomeque's inn

00:48:45.893 --> 00:48:50.960
reflects that of the structure
of the Quixote Part I,

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:54.904
with its interpolated stories
of which you're going to read

00:48:54.904 --> 00:48:56.059
some very soon.
 

00:48:56.059 --> 00:49:01.670
And also Cervantes's notorious
errors, and even Don Quixote's

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:07.282
practice of letting Rocinante's
whim dictate the direction of

00:49:07.282 --> 00:49:08.780
his journey.
 

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:14.280
Now, the Quixote is the
only classic that about which

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:18.849
there is a whole bibliography
about its errors.

00:49:18.849 --> 00:49:21.552
All classics have--you know,
they say that Homer fell asleep

00:49:21.552 --> 00:49:22.719
here,
and something happened,

00:49:22.719 --> 00:49:24.110
and the Odyssey is not
perfect,

00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:27.574
and this and that,
but the errors in the 1605

00:49:27.574 --> 00:49:31.119
Quixote are a notorious
part of it,

00:49:31.119 --> 00:49:36.510
and a lot has been written
about them,

00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:38.889
because improvisation can lead
to errors,

00:49:38.889 --> 00:49:42.880
and there are quite a few in
Part I.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.800
Let me list some of them.
 

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:49.376
There are errors that the
characters make that cannot be

00:49:49.376 --> 00:49:52.369
attributed to Cervantes but to
their haste,

00:49:52.369 --> 00:49:53.510
that is, the haste of the
characters,

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:57.001
their carelessness,
but all of that is within the

00:49:57.001 --> 00:49:57.730
fiction.
 

00:49:57.730 --> 00:50:01.018
These are the errors that later
on you will find,

00:50:01.018 --> 00:50:04.581
Dorotea makes them while
playing Princess Micomicona,

00:50:04.581 --> 00:50:08.356
Don Quixote makes a few;
in chapter IV he says that

00:50:08.356 --> 00:50:11.858
seven times nine is
seventy-three--this could be a

00:50:11.858 --> 00:50:12.429
typo.
 

00:50:12.429 --> 00:50:16.186
Later he says that the biblical
Samson removed the doors of the

00:50:16.186 --> 00:50:19.820
temple, when it was the gates of
the city of Gaza that Samson

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:20.730
ripped off.
 

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:24.182
And there are other kinds of
errors that can be blamed on

00:50:24.182 --> 00:50:25.909
Cervantes and his editors.
 

00:50:25.909 --> 00:50:29.893
For instance,
the mistaken chapter titles and

00:50:29.893 --> 00:50:30.800
numbers.
 

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:34.554
The title of chapter X
reads--not in your translation,

00:50:34.554 --> 00:50:38.309
where it was fixed,
but in the original--it reads:

00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:41.630
"Concerning what further
befell Don Quixote with the

00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:45.248
gallant Basque and the danger in
which he found himself with a

00:50:45.248 --> 00:50:47.679
band of Galicians from
Yanguas."

00:50:47.679 --> 00:50:51.079
But the episode with the Basque
is over,

00:50:51.079 --> 00:50:54.567
and the fracas with the
Yanguesans doesn't come until

00:50:54.567 --> 00:50:58.818
five chapters later,
after the Grisóstomo and

00:50:58.818 --> 00:51:00.480
Marcela interlude.
 

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:06.599
Chapter XLIV appears in roman
numerals as chapter XXXV,

00:51:06.599 --> 00:51:07.960
and so on.
 

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:13.780
But the grandest mistake was
the theft of Sancho's donkey,

00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:19.083
which you have not reached yet;
but in chapter XXV the reader

00:51:19.083 --> 00:51:22.416
finds out that Sancho's donkey
is not just missing,

00:51:22.416 --> 00:51:24.150
but that it was stolen!
 

00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:27.822
After twelve chapters,
we started worrying about the

00:51:27.822 --> 00:51:31.639
lost of recovered donkey,
here reappears gradually.

00:51:31.639 --> 00:51:36.869
His trappings are mentioned,
until in chapter XLVI he is

00:51:36.869 --> 00:51:40.483
there, again,
miraculously in the inn's

00:51:40.483 --> 00:51:41.530
stable!
 

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:46.780
This is all in the first Juan
de la Cuesta 1605 edition--Juan

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:51.420
de la Cuesta was the publisher
of the 1605 edition.

00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:54.248
Actually, the very first
printing was late 1604,

00:51:54.248 --> 00:51:57.257
but it was given the 1605,
if you want to be really

00:51:57.257 --> 00:51:58.039
pedantic.
 

00:51:58.039 --> 00:52:02.733
But it's the 1605 date that is
given--This is all in the first

00:52:02.733 --> 00:52:07.119
Juan de la Cuesta edition,
the princeps edition.

00:52:07.119 --> 00:52:11.480
But in the second 1605
printing, it's also well--

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:15.909
a new printing had to be
made--also by Juan de la Cuesta,

00:52:15.909 --> 00:52:18.822
the theft of the donkey appears
in chapter XXIII and it's

00:52:18.822 --> 00:52:22.202
recovered in chapter XXX,
and Cervantes has added a

00:52:22.202 --> 00:52:25.739
series of paragraphs to justify
all of this--

00:52:25.739 --> 00:52:28.130
these are hilarious paragraphs.
 

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:33.380
The writing in these added
passages reads very much like

00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:37.257
Cervantes's prose to me,
though not to other scholars,

00:52:37.257 --> 00:52:39.360
who think that this is somebody
else writing,

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:42.583
so editors have incorporated
them into the final version of

00:52:42.583 --> 00:52:43.250
the model.
 

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:47.106
A critic, named Lathrop,
thinks that the additions were

00:52:47.106 --> 00:52:50.693
by the editor,
and believes that all of these

00:52:50.693 --> 00:52:54.809
mistakes were put it the
Quixote on purpose by

00:52:54.809 --> 00:52:55.840
Cervantes.
 

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:58.567
Once you have something like
this, there are critics who can

00:52:58.567 --> 00:53:02.869
claim anything,
that it was not a case of

00:53:02.869 --> 00:53:09.809
careless improvisation but a
plan to simulate it.

00:53:09.809 --> 00:53:12.579
The issue is mute for me.
 

00:53:12.579 --> 00:53:14.536
In either case,
willed or not,

00:53:14.536 --> 00:53:18.152
the mistakes reveal a hasty,
shoddy composition,

00:53:18.152 --> 00:53:21.199
and imperfection and lack of
finish,

00:53:21.199 --> 00:53:24.240
as it were, and fits with the
topic of improvisation

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:27.764
introduced in the prologue,
when the narrator,

00:53:27.764 --> 00:53:32.005
or Cervantes,
claims that he doesn't know how

00:53:32.005 --> 00:53:37.402
to write the prologue and
presents himself as someone who

00:53:37.402 --> 00:53:41.739
is not in total control of his
creation.

00:53:41.739 --> 00:53:48.500
Now, back to Juan Palomeque's
inn.

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:54.215
I hope you have understood my
equating the improvisation and

00:53:54.215 --> 00:53:59.639
the ramshackle character of the
inn, and that of the 1605

00:53:59.639 --> 00:54:01.480
Quixote.
 

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:05.690
Now, Sancho's blanket
tossing--I must mention the last

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:09.550
event at the inn,
because Sancho never forgives

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:12.369
Don Quixote for not defending
him,

00:54:12.369 --> 00:54:17.367
and the failure of his master
to act is something that casts

00:54:17.367 --> 00:54:21.518
doubts in his mind about Don
Quixote's courage.

00:54:21.518 --> 00:54:24.954
Don Quixote justifies it
because he claims that he's not

00:54:24.954 --> 00:54:27.889
supposed to enter into battle
against commoners,

00:54:27.889 --> 00:54:29.699
and that Rocinante froze.
 

00:54:29.699 --> 00:54:32.989
The importance of this episode
is that Cervantes is building up

00:54:32.989 --> 00:54:35.590
the relationship between his two
protagonists,

00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:39.369
which will deepen in the next
episodes,

00:54:39.369 --> 00:54:42.784
first when Sancho helps to cure
Don Quixote when he's wounded by

00:54:42.784 --> 00:54:44.900
the shepherds defending their
sheep,

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:48.298
and later when Don Quixote,
angry at Sancho for laughing at

00:54:48.298 --> 00:54:49.931
him,
strikes his squire--You

00:54:49.931 --> 00:54:52.639
remember when Don Quixote hits
him over the head--

00:54:52.639 --> 00:54:56.759
This deepening relationship is
one of the great virtues of the

00:54:56.759 --> 00:54:57.300
novel.
 

00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:01.487
Cervantes displays a profound
and caring knowledge of human

00:55:01.487 --> 00:55:04.449
nature and of the
transformations of human

00:55:04.449 --> 00:55:07.422
relationships;
it's something to learn from

00:55:07.422 --> 00:55:08.018
the book.
 

00:55:08.018 --> 00:55:12.034
This is new for a fiction,
that their relationship

00:55:12.034 --> 00:55:16.048
transcends the social
differences between them and

00:55:16.048 --> 00:55:21.293
becomes profound and complicated
because of these spats that they

00:55:21.293 --> 00:55:23.260
occasionally have.
 

00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:26.159
The following episodes follow
the same pattern.

00:55:26.159 --> 00:55:30.525
Don Quixote and Sancho mistake
what they see with catastrophic

00:55:30.525 --> 00:55:31.599
consequences.
 

00:55:31.599 --> 00:55:34.456
It's the same pattern
established in the episode of

00:55:34.456 --> 00:55:35.369
the windmills.
 

00:55:35.369 --> 00:55:39.900
The first is the battle with
the herds of sheep--that I hope

00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:44.280
you found as hilarious as I
always do when I reread it.

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:47.090
Don Quixote is,
again, fooled by a real world

00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:51.050
that seems to conspire to look
like what he has in his head.

00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:54.001
In this case,
the sheep reflect what you must

00:55:54.001 --> 00:55:58.159
have read in Elliott about the
importance of sheep farming,

00:55:58.159 --> 00:56:00.518
and of the wool industry in
Castile--

00:56:00.518 --> 00:56:04.166
It's still very important,
and I have been suddenly in a

00:56:04.166 --> 00:56:07.550
Castilian town and a whole sea
of sheep come by,

00:56:07.550 --> 00:56:10.599
they are being herded to the
north or to the south,

00:56:10.599 --> 00:56:13.369
as the case may be.
 

00:56:13.369 --> 00:56:17.164
Wool was a very important
product of Castile,

00:56:17.164 --> 00:56:20.268
as you have read in the
Elliott, and,

00:56:20.268 --> 00:56:25.010
of course, this sheep at the
distance could look like an

00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:25.960
army.
 

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:32.521
So Cervantes is reflecting here
not only the reality of everyday

00:56:32.521 --> 00:56:38.039
life, but also the broader,
socioeconomic realities of

00:56:38.039 --> 00:56:40.539
Spain of the period.
 

00:56:40.539 --> 00:56:44.945
Don Quixote translates
everything that reminds him of

00:56:44.945 --> 00:56:49.690
the world or romances of
chivalry into their language.

00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:52.934
His arguments with Sancho and
others about the nature of the

00:56:52.934 --> 00:56:55.630
real are one of the sources of
humor in the novel,

00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:56.400
of course.
 

00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:59.907
Here, Cervantes displays his
own gift for linguistic

00:56:59.907 --> 00:57:01.489
invention and parody.
 

00:57:01.489 --> 00:57:05.018
The names of the knights
involved are hilarious,

00:57:05.018 --> 00:57:08.396
as is his description of the
imaginary battle,

00:57:08.396 --> 00:57:10.500
has a mock epic quality.
 

00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:13.690
Don Quixote,
hurt by stones whose names,

00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:16.539
almonds, they're called at one
point,

00:57:16.539 --> 00:57:20.429
understate their ability to
hurt, lose its teeth,

00:57:20.429 --> 00:57:23.889
as he had before lost part of
an ear.

00:57:23.889 --> 00:57:26.619
These are the scars of time on
his body that I have mentioned

00:57:26.619 --> 00:57:27.030
before.
 

00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:30.268
His body has diminished as the
work progresses,

00:57:30.268 --> 00:57:33.519
contributing to his sorry
appearance and leading to the

00:57:33.519 --> 00:57:36.469
name that Sancho gives him in
the next episode.

00:57:36.469 --> 00:57:41.101
Notice that Don Quixote kills
several sheep and that he has,

00:57:41.101 --> 00:57:43.768
again, been involved in a
fight.

00:57:43.768 --> 00:57:47.440
Hence, he has committed crimes
that come under the jurisdiction

00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:50.726
of the Holy Brotherhood,
so besides the disputes about

00:57:50.726 --> 00:57:54.277
the real and the parody of the
romances of chivalry it must be

00:57:54.277 --> 00:57:57.420
noted that Don Quixote and
Sancho are criminals who are

00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:59.050
fugitives from justice.
 

00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:06.032
Now, I want you to--I'm sure
you did--that Don Quixote and

00:58:06.032 --> 00:58:10.320
Sancho vomit on each other,
here.

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:18.690
And I want to ponder about this
little episode.

00:58:18.690 --> 00:58:22.056
We already saw the purging
involved in the character's

00:58:22.056 --> 00:58:24.978
evacuations, but here,
I believe, that there is

00:58:24.978 --> 00:58:26.440
another suggestion.
 

00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:30.398
I was going to read you that
passage, but the time is short,

00:58:30.398 --> 00:58:32.480
but I'm sure you remember it.
 

00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:39.152
Vomiting here and in the inn
suggest the existence of a

00:58:39.152 --> 00:58:45.210
concretely repulsive language of
pure meanings.

00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:49.447
The mouth, amidst concrete,
it's a language whose effect is

00:58:49.447 --> 00:58:53.465
repulsion, mutual repulsion,
but that is never a form of

00:58:53.465 --> 00:58:54.780
communication.
 

00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:58.338
One vomit elicits--that it is
nevertheless,

00:58:58.338 --> 00:59:03.000
a form of communication--one
vomit elicits the other.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.389
It is in this sense a pure
language, an ironic fusion of

00:59:06.389 --> 00:59:07.559
words and things.
 

00:59:07.559 --> 00:59:10.965
If you think that words merely
reflect reality,

00:59:10.965 --> 00:59:14.077
vomit is reality itself
expressed as words,

00:59:14.077 --> 00:59:16.670
this is what I'm trying to say.
 

00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:22.617
Vomit contains objects,
not signs, and produces bodily

00:59:22.617 --> 00:59:27.043
effects as when,
in the case in the next

00:59:27.043 --> 00:59:32.030
episode, when Don Quixote smells
Sancho's feces,

00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:39.780
another expression on the part
of Sancho,

00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:42.460
and he asks him to move away.
 

00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:46.204
This consideration of language
dovetails with all of the

00:59:46.204 --> 00:59:50.427
meditations about language and
literature that are in the book,

00:59:50.427 --> 00:59:52.539
and it is very appropriate.
 

00:59:52.539 --> 00:59:55.400
I think that it should occur in
an episode,

00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:59.144
where there is such a marvelous
display of literary language in

00:59:59.144 --> 01:00:02.768
the description of these battles
and all of these knights.

01:00:02.768 --> 01:00:06.791
So we have that literary
language, and then,

01:00:06.791 --> 01:00:11.844
this concrete language of
vomit, when they express each

01:00:11.844 --> 01:00:14.090
other in such a way.
 

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:20.161
I think that I'm going to leave
the next two episodes for the

01:00:20.161 --> 01:00:24.478
next class,
the one about the dead body,

01:00:24.478 --> 01:00:29.653
because there is very
significant moment there when

01:00:29.653 --> 01:00:36.280
Sancho names Don Quixote The
Knight of the Sorrowful Figure,

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.739
and also the one of the
fulling-hammers,

01:00:38.739 --> 01:00:42.932
to which I have just alluded
because of this hilarious moment

01:00:42.932 --> 01:00:45.518
when Sancho defecates out of
fear,

01:00:45.518 --> 01:00:52.820
and so we shall move on with
next series of episodes,

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:55.570
too, which take us to the core
of Part I.

01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:58.813
The core of Part I,
which are the episodes that

01:00:58.813 --> 01:01:01.210
take place in the Sierra Morena.
 

01:01:01.210 --> 01:01:07.000

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.220
Prof: Okay, good morning.
 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.560
One prefatory point before we
get into today's lecture.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.186
That's occasioned by having you
read MacIntyre,

00:00:14.186 --> 00:00:18.050
but I ought really to have
mentioned it before.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.870
MacIntyre's book,
After Virtue,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.782
is in part a conversation with
major figures in the tradition

00:00:25.782 --> 00:00:30.105
who you have not read,
or at least not in this course,

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:34.749
Aquinas,
Nietzsche, Hegel and many

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:36.000
others.
 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.710
And of course this came up with
John Rawls,

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.481
and indeed Robert Nozick,
both of whom depended on

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:49.227
arguments from Immanuel Kant
that we haven't studied in this

00:00:49.227 --> 00:00:50.980
course either.
 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.367
And so one question that arises
is, well, to what extent are you

00:00:56.367 --> 00:01:01.156
responsible for understanding
the people on whom they are

00:01:01.156 --> 00:01:02.439
commenting?
 

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:06.546
And of course you're entering
into an ongoing conversation

00:01:06.546 --> 00:01:10.799
among these thinkers that's been
going on for centuries,

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.560
and to some degree you just
have to jump in somewhere.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.221
Nonetheless,
for the purposes of our course

00:01:18.221 --> 00:01:21.644
here you're certainly not
responsible for understanding

00:01:21.644 --> 00:01:25.248
Kant's ethics,
and indeed I could give several

00:01:25.248 --> 00:01:29.967
lectures on why it is the case
that Kant would not have agreed

00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:33.757
either with Rawls's
interpretation of his own work

00:01:33.757 --> 00:01:36.620
or with the Rawlsian enterprise.
 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.081
But we're not really interested
in Kant in this course,

00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:45.420
but in Rawls,
in that instance.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.682
So to the extent he depends
upon a faulty reading of Kant's

00:01:50.682 --> 00:01:55.220
Groundwork of the Metaphysics
of Morals,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.434
that's not a question with
which we're engaged in this

00:01:58.434 --> 00:01:58.980
course.
 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.120
It's not that we're taking a
position about it;

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.718
we're just agnostic.
 

00:02:03.718 --> 00:02:09.280
Likewise, with the various
thinkers that MacIntyre engages,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.508
you're not expected to know
Saint Benedict,

00:02:14.508 --> 00:02:17.699
or Nietzsche,
or Aquinas, or anybody else,

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:20.812
or indeed Aristotle,
about whom I'll have quite a

00:02:20.812 --> 00:02:24.732
bit to say today,
except insofar as they are

00:02:24.732 --> 00:02:28.970
building blocks for MacIntyre's
argument.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.340
So MacIntyre's work,
in some ways,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.030
is a commentary on the history
of ideas,

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.110
but really it's first and
foremost an argument,

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.030
and we're interested in it as
an argument,

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.590
and that's how we're going to
evaluate it.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.060
So, of course,
it's an invitation to you,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.604
later on, to go into some of
these thinkers in-depth with

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:55.214
whom he is engaged and see
whether ultimately you agree or

00:02:55.214 --> 00:02:59.139
disagree with the way in which
he engages those thinkers,

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.150
but that's not our agenda here.
 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.063
Our agenda here is to think of
Alasdair MacIntyre as somebody

00:03:06.063 --> 00:03:09.000
who's making an argument in his
own right,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.218
and that's how we're going to
engage with his work.

00:03:13.218 --> 00:03:20.479
He is a political theorist who
currently teaches at Notre Dame.

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:25.098
Interestingly,
they say that the hand that

00:03:25.098 --> 00:03:31.068
rocks the cradle controls the
person forever after.

00:03:31.068 --> 00:03:34.257
He started out,
I think he was raised in a

00:03:34.257 --> 00:03:37.979
Catholic--
he had a Catholic upbringing,

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:42.610
but early on in his career,
he must be well into his 80s

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.556
now, early on in his career he
wrote a book called Marxism

00:03:46.556 --> 00:03:50.586
and Christianity,
and he was clearly wrestling

00:03:50.586 --> 00:03:54.340
with who wins out of Marx and
Christianity.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.818
And in that book he concluded
the Marxism won.

00:03:58.818 --> 00:04:04.000
And in his early incarnations
he was a fairly conventional

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.526
Marxist,
but then gradually he came full

00:04:07.526 --> 00:04:11.520
circle and ended up rejecting
not only Marxism,

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.318
but the larger Enlightenment
project of which Marxism,

00:04:15.318 --> 00:04:18.480
as you all know,
is only one part.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.494
And he ended up affirming a
kind of traditional mix of

00:04:23.494 --> 00:04:28.980
Aristotelianism and the Catholic
tradition that informs his

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.374
argument both in After
Virtue and then a subsequent

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:37.973
book,
which I'm not having you read,

00:04:37.973 --> 00:04:43.149
called Whose Justice?
Which Rationality?

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:47.233
So he is somebody who,
in an important sense,

00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:49.370
has come full circle.
 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.002
And I think that's an important
piece of background to know in

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:57.420
understanding his work After
Virtue.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.521
He's written many other books
too but this is the book for

00:05:01.521 --> 00:05:03.680
which he will be remembered.
 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.834
You might think it odd that a
book with a title like that

00:05:06.834 --> 00:05:09.824
could have become a bestseller,
but it really was a

00:05:09.824 --> 00:05:12.600
philosophical bestseller when it
was published,

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.624
I believe, in 1984,
and the edition you have

00:05:17.624 --> 00:05:24.165
includes an afterword where he
responds to critics of the

00:05:24.165 --> 00:05:26.269
original book.
 

00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:33.471
So who is Alasdair MacIntyre,
and how does he relate to the

00:05:33.471 --> 00:05:39.805
historical anti-Enlightenment
thinkers we've already

00:05:39.805 --> 00:05:44.649
discussed, namely Burke and
Devlin?

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:51.036
Well, he is very much in the
spirit of the tradition in which

00:05:51.036 --> 00:05:54.694
they both wrote,
although, as you could probably

00:05:54.694 --> 00:05:56.750
guess from his historical
trajectory,

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.262
one thing that differentiates
him is that at least for much of

00:06:00.262 --> 00:06:03.603
his life he thought of himself
as somebody on the political

00:06:03.603 --> 00:06:06.293
left,
whereas they were people on the

00:06:06.293 --> 00:06:09.502
political right,
and we'll come back to the

00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:11.639
significance of that later.
 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:16.862
He is part of a general
undertow or reaction against the

00:06:16.862 --> 00:06:20.850
Rawlsian enterprise in political
theory.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.002
Other thinkers,
which you're not reading but

00:06:25.002 --> 00:06:30.990
with whom he would naturally
have some elective affinities,

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.230
are the philosopher Richard
Rorty who died recently,

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.043
who wrote a fabulously good
book called Philosophy and

00:06:39.043 --> 00:06:44.012
the Mirror of Nature,
which was a critique of the

00:06:44.012 --> 00:06:48.209
Enlightenment project in
philosophy.

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:52.879
Rorty's argument was basically
that the Enlightenment quest

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:55.860
with certainty was a fool's
errand.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.800
That there is no such thing as
certainty to be had,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.500
we've discussed this quite
extensively,

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.574
of course, in connection with
the early versus late

00:07:06.574 --> 00:07:09.367
Enlightenment,
which is not a distinction

00:07:09.367 --> 00:07:10.449
Richard Rorty made.
 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:14.019
But in any event,
he made the argument that the

00:07:14.019 --> 00:07:18.055
Enlightenment quest for
certainty was a fool's errand

00:07:18.055 --> 00:07:22.557
begun basically by Descartes and
taken to its apotheosis in

00:07:22.557 --> 00:07:26.050
Kant's Critique of Pure
Reason,

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:31.291
and that philosophers from
Descartes to Kant got engaged in

00:07:31.291 --> 00:07:36.264
this hopeless endeavor of
justifying philosophy from the

00:07:36.264 --> 00:07:39.879
ground up from indubitable
premises.

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:45.244
And when they failed to do that
they thought that some important

00:07:45.244 --> 00:07:48.480
philosophical failure had
occurred,

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.230
whereas Rorty's point was they
should never have been engaged

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.420
in that enterprise to begin
with.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:58.673
And he connects importantly to
the modern pragmatist tradition

00:07:58.673 --> 00:08:01.778
of Dewey,
and Peirce, and James,

00:08:01.778 --> 00:08:06.829
and to the postmodernist
thinkers like Lyotard,

00:08:06.829 --> 00:08:12.235
to some extent Michel Foucault,
and others that we don't have

00:08:12.235 --> 00:08:14.939
time to read in this course.
 

00:08:14.939 --> 00:08:18.961
So Rorty is an anti-modernist,
but he's a postmodernist

00:08:18.961 --> 00:08:22.240
anti-modernist if you want lots
of jargon.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.800
He thinks we should get beyond
the Enlightenment project.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.810
He has also written some about
politics,

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:34.298
and indeed he has a political
analog of his philosophical

00:08:34.298 --> 00:08:37.380
argument,
which the bumper sticker

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:42.860
version of it is that thinking
we have to justify our political

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.899
institutions from the ground up
is also a mug's game,

00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:51.754
and indeed a dangerous mug's
game, because when we fail to do

00:08:51.754 --> 00:08:55.547
that we start to think that
there's something wrong with our

00:08:55.547 --> 00:08:59.274
political institutions that
they're illegitimate because we

00:08:59.274 --> 00:09:03.066
couldn't justify them from the
ground up successfully by the

00:09:03.066 --> 00:09:05.830
terms of the Enlightenment
project.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.450
Therefore, they're not
justifiable.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:12.293
And this, Rorty thinks,
puts us at a competitive

00:09:12.293 --> 00:09:13.519
disadvantage.
 

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:15.720
Though he was writing during
the Cold War,

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:20.629
so with our antagonists behind
the iron curtain,

00:09:20.629 --> 00:09:25.321
but I think he would make the
same argument were he alive

00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:29.928
today about fundamentalist
antagonists who we would,

00:09:29.928 --> 00:09:33.333
by Rorty's way of thinking,
be putting ourselves at a

00:09:33.333 --> 00:09:37.065
competitive disadvantage with by
holding ourselves and our

00:09:37.065 --> 00:09:40.470
institutions to a standard which
cannot be met,

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.445
and then when we fail to meet
it losing confidence in our

00:09:44.445 --> 00:09:45.509
institutions.
 

00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:50.058
So we could have read Richard
Rorty in this course,

00:09:50.058 --> 00:09:52.152
but the truth is,
and this is a dogmatic

00:09:52.152 --> 00:09:55.208
statement and maybe some of you
will second-guess me on it

00:09:55.208 --> 00:09:57.986
later,
the truth is Rorty is a much

00:09:57.986 --> 00:10:02.048
better philosopher than he is a
political theorist.

00:10:02.048 --> 00:10:06.083
And so I've chosen to have you
read MacIntyre who I think is a

00:10:06.083 --> 00:10:09.590
better political theorist than
he is a philosopher.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.620
There are others.
 

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:15.008
Perhaps one of the most famous
is Michael Walzer who wrote a

00:10:15.008 --> 00:10:17.759
book called Spheres of
Justice,

00:10:17.759 --> 00:10:23.831
who also rejects the idea
that the values guiding politics

00:10:23.831 --> 00:10:29.504
can be justified in a logical
sense from indubitable first

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:35.774
premises and generate guides for
action in politics that must be

00:10:35.774 --> 00:10:41.250
compelling to any right-thinking
rational person.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.750
All of these thinkers,
Rorty, Walzer,

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:49.517
MacIntyre sometimes get grouped
under this idea of

00:10:49.517 --> 00:10:51.559
communitarianism.
 

00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:53.308
Communitarianism.
 

00:10:53.308 --> 00:10:59.374
And communitarianism is linked
to the anti-Enlightenment

00:10:59.374 --> 00:11:04.666
endeavor in that it is the
ahistorical version of

00:11:04.666 --> 00:11:06.210
tradition.
 

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:12.740
That is instead of with Burke
and Devlin appealing to

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:17.889
tradition as the basis for our
values,

00:11:17.889 --> 00:11:23.559
communitarians appeal to the
community-accepted values as the

00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:26.678
basis for what should guide us.
 

00:11:26.678 --> 00:11:30.880
Now obviously the two things
are connected and we'll see

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.235
they're deeply connected in
MacIntyre's historical account

00:11:35.235 --> 00:11:38.980
because communities are shaped
by traditions.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.480
But at the end of the day
what's going to be important for

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.904
us is that the individual is
subservient to the community

00:11:47.904 --> 00:11:52.801
rather than the community being
the creature or the creation of

00:11:52.801 --> 00:11:54.460
the individual.
 

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.230
So the community comes first.
 

00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:00.273
The individual is born into the
community rather than the

00:12:00.273 --> 00:12:03.740
community being the product of
some contract,

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.741
or creation,
or construction of the

00:12:06.741 --> 00:12:07.889
individual.
 

00:12:07.889 --> 00:12:13.668
So that's what all of these
thinkers share in common.

00:12:13.668 --> 00:12:18.583
Now, one of the things that
makes MacIntyre's book a little

00:12:18.583 --> 00:12:23.581
bit difficult to read is it's a
work in the history of ideas

00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:26.038
that's written backwards.
 

00:12:26.038 --> 00:12:30.590
That is he starts with the
present and works back to the

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:31.500
ancients.
 

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:37.230
It's a very interesting thing
to do.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:44.080
In fact, I once taught the
political science 114 course,

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.121
the intro to the history of
ideas, and partly inspired by

00:12:48.121 --> 00:12:51.009
MacIntyre's effort I did it
backwards.

00:12:51.009 --> 00:12:53.000
I went from Rawls to Plato.
 

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.649
And there are interesting
pedagogical challenges there,

00:12:59.649 --> 00:13:03.025
and I'm not sure whether it's
worth doing just for its own

00:13:03.025 --> 00:13:05.019
sake,
but MacIntyre does it for a

00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:07.688
reason;
not just to be cute which I

00:13:07.688 --> 00:13:10.730
think maybe what I was trying to
do.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:16.282
MacIntyre does it for a reason
and his reason is that he thinks

00:13:16.282 --> 00:13:21.386
that at sometime around the
beginning of the Enlightenment

00:13:21.386 --> 00:13:26.940
the Western intellectual project
went badly off the rails.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:33.019
And in some way his argument is
an analog of the argument I made

00:13:33.019 --> 00:13:36.590
to you about Locke and
workmanship.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.523
Because, after all,
think about what I said about

00:13:39.523 --> 00:13:40.990
Locke and workmanship.
 

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.980
I said there was basically a
coherent story.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:47.720
God created the world.
 

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:52.070
He has workmanship knowledge
and rights over it.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:55.653
He creates humans with the
capacity to act in a god-like

00:13:55.653 --> 00:13:57.644
fashion,
miniature gods,

00:13:57.644 --> 00:14:01.470
although they're constrained by
God's will,

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:06.850
and it all fits together as a
kind of coherent whole.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:11.308
Once you buy into the premises
it all fits together,

00:14:11.308 --> 00:14:16.827
but then what happens in the
history of the workmanship model

00:14:16.827 --> 00:14:20.139
is people start to secularize
it,

00:14:20.139 --> 00:14:24.421
and so start taking on bits and
pieces of the original

00:14:24.421 --> 00:14:29.106
workmanship idea without the
unifying assumptions that gave

00:14:29.106 --> 00:14:31.450
that model its coherence.
 

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.960
And we saw the various
difficulties everybody ran into

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.013
in doing that,
Marx, and Nozick,

00:14:37.013 --> 00:14:39.000
and Rawls and many others.
 

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.928
So MacIntyre does something
analogous in his book.

00:14:45.928 --> 00:14:52.423
What he wants to say is that
the task of coming up with

00:14:52.423 --> 00:14:59.157
compelling moral values to guide
politics made sense in a

00:14:59.157 --> 00:15:04.928
framework of assumptions that we
inherited,

00:15:04.928 --> 00:15:10.908
but we inherited in a kind of
degraded way.

00:15:10.908 --> 00:15:16.177
That the unifying assumptions
that used to give political

00:15:16.177 --> 00:15:22.197
morality its coherence have been
jettisoned as a byproduct of the

00:15:22.197 --> 00:15:27.745
Enlightenment project and for
that reason we need to go back

00:15:27.745 --> 00:15:33.389
in time and see where the
project went off the rails,

00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:38.952
see what it was that happened
that caused modern thinkers to

00:15:38.952 --> 00:15:44.230
get involved in this fool's
errand of justifying morality

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.399
from the ground up.
 

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:52.071
Justifying morality from the
ground up cannot be done because

00:15:52.071 --> 00:15:56.892
of the expectations about
justification that we have

00:15:56.892 --> 00:16:00.725
developed,
but MacIntyre's claim is you

00:16:00.725 --> 00:16:05.817
can't see that unless you go
backwards in time to understand

00:16:05.817 --> 00:16:09.960
how and where the project went
off the rails.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:15.244
So that's the big enterprise of
his book, and we'll mostly get

00:16:15.244 --> 00:16:18.710
into that big enterprise on
Wednesday.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:23.960
But I want to focus at the
start on the beginning of his

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:29.782
book, and the beginning of his
book deals with the symptoms of

00:16:29.782 --> 00:16:31.308
our problem.
 

00:16:31.308 --> 00:16:36.333
Perhaps the most important
symptom of our problem you've

00:16:36.333 --> 00:16:41.541
already confronted in this
course when we talked about the

00:16:41.541 --> 00:16:46.929
transition from classical to
neoclassical utilitarianism and

00:16:46.929 --> 00:16:51.538
the rise of emotivism,
Charles Stevenson and all that.

00:16:51.538 --> 00:16:52.778
Does anyone remember?
 

00:16:52.778 --> 00:16:56.317
Maybe you've already forgotten
all of this it was so long ago

00:16:56.317 --> 00:16:56.730
now.
 

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:01.150
Remember Stevenson said--this
is the guy who didn't get tenure

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.992
in the Yale Philosophy
Department because he seemed to

00:17:04.992 --> 00:17:09.414
have this extreme relativistic
and subjectivist view of ethics

00:17:09.414 --> 00:17:13.618
where moral choices were just
differences in taste,

00:17:13.618 --> 00:17:17.910
differences in flavors of ice
cream.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:22.900
You say the welfare state is
good.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.808
I say the welfare state is bad.
 

00:17:24.808 --> 00:17:32.680
It's just like saying chocolate
ice cream is good or strawberry

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.220
ice cream is good.
 

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:40.242
The differences about morality
are just merely subjective

00:17:40.242 --> 00:17:41.500
differences.
 

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:46.901
So we go from this certainty,
subjective certainty in the

00:17:46.901 --> 00:17:52.207
early Enlightenment as making
politics like mathematical

00:17:52.207 --> 00:17:58.090
geometric proofs for Hobbes and
Locke to the mere subjectivism

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:03.299
of the mature Enlightenment
which produces this kind of

00:18:03.299 --> 00:18:08.509
relativist morality where
everything is just subjective

00:18:08.509 --> 00:18:14.490
opinion that morality is nothing
more than emotion,

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:19.579
and there's no particular
reason even to think we have the

00:18:19.579 --> 00:18:21.009
same emotions.
 

00:18:21.009 --> 00:18:24.549
Remember that,
as I think I said to you at the

00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:29.532
time,
Stephenson was criticizing

00:18:29.532 --> 00:18:33.259
David Hume,
who's another important

00:18:33.259 --> 00:18:37.169
utilitarian thinker who we
didn't have time to read in this

00:18:37.169 --> 00:18:41.077
course either but you should all
read at some point in your

00:18:41.077 --> 00:18:41.818
lives.
 

00:18:41.818 --> 00:18:44.269
And Hume had said,
"Well yes,

00:18:44.269 --> 00:18:49.082
you can't get any important
statements about what ought to

00:18:49.082 --> 00:18:53.808
be the case from empirical
statements about the world.

00:18:53.808 --> 00:18:56.227
There's no way to get from is
to ought,"

00:18:56.227 --> 00:18:58.480
as Hume said,
"But, you know what?

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.890
Most people are pretty much
alike.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:04.130
Most people are pretty much the
same."

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:08.531
So we can, to use the jargon of
utilitarianism,

00:19:08.531 --> 00:19:13.987
we can make pretty confident
interpersonal judgments about

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:15.038
people.
 

00:19:15.038 --> 00:19:19.423
People are pretty similar,
and so what's good for one

00:19:19.423 --> 00:19:23.048
person is likely to be good for
another,

00:19:23.048 --> 00:19:27.130
and that's why Hume has this
rather cryptic one-liner that

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:30.827
scholars have debated,
to the effect that "if all

00:19:30.827 --> 00:19:34.213
factual questions were resolved
no moral questions would

00:19:34.213 --> 00:19:35.200
remain."
 

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.782
It's this notion,
well, people are pretty much

00:19:38.782 --> 00:19:43.323
the same and so even though
morality is rooted in people's

00:19:43.323 --> 00:19:47.066
emotional reactions to
situations it's not a big

00:19:47.066 --> 00:19:51.525
problem to having a morality
that can form the basis of a

00:19:51.525 --> 00:19:52.798
society.
 

00:19:52.798 --> 00:19:56.509
Stephenson said,
"How do you know?

00:19:56.509 --> 00:19:58.140
How do you know?
 

00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.298
How do you, David Hume, know?
 

00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:04.020
Maybe Adolph Eichmann has one
set of emotional reactions to

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:09.150
the prospect of shipping people
off the concentration camps,

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:13.285
and you and I have a different
set of emotional reactions to

00:20:13.285 --> 00:20:16.509
shipping people off to
concentration camps,

00:20:16.509 --> 00:20:20.391
and if you're saying there are
no principles by which we can

00:20:20.391 --> 00:20:22.759
adjudicate among those
reactions,

00:20:22.759 --> 00:20:26.673
those emotional reactions,
you're throwing us into a sea

00:20:26.673 --> 00:20:28.240
of relativism."
 

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:33.651
And so when you get to
emotivism, you're getting to

00:20:33.651 --> 00:20:39.711
this world in which we are
completely without instruments

00:20:39.711 --> 00:20:45.339
for making moral judgments when
people disagree.

00:20:45.339 --> 00:20:48.868
That is the emotivist culture.
 

00:20:48.868 --> 00:20:56.640
It is a culture of tastes and
not of interpersonal judgments.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:01.884
And one of the things MacIntyre
wants to say is that all of this

00:21:01.884 --> 00:21:05.880
becomes inevitable in the
seventeenth century.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.029
It's just a question of time.
 

00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:10.440
It's just a question of time.
 

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:15.185
Once you look at what was
really going on in the beginning

00:21:15.185 --> 00:21:20.349
of the Enlightenment you're
going to wind up with emotivism.

00:21:20.349 --> 00:21:23.259
Just a question of time.
 

00:21:23.259 --> 00:21:27.420
And the politics that comes out
of it is pretty ugly.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:32.852
The politics that comes out of
it basically leaves you without

00:21:32.852 --> 00:21:38.285
standards of moral judgment and
indeed without questioning the

00:21:38.285 --> 00:21:40.690
raw assertion of power.
 

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:44.365
So it's not only that in
philosophy we wind up with

00:21:44.365 --> 00:21:49.069
emotivism, but in politics we're
ultimately going to wind up with

00:21:49.069 --> 00:21:50.098
Nietzsche.
 

00:21:50.098 --> 00:21:55.865
We're going to wind up with
kind of nihilist assertion of

00:21:55.865 --> 00:22:01.940
the inevitability of the triumph
of the will, the triumph of

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:02.970
power.
 

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:07.634
So again, Nietzsche is somebody
else I wish we had time to talk

00:22:07.634 --> 00:22:12.125
about in this course,
but you'll have to read him for

00:22:12.125 --> 00:22:15.940
our purposes through the eyes of
MacIntyre.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:21.342
So it all goes back around the
late sixteenth and early

00:22:21.342 --> 00:22:26.944
seventeenth century and then
we're just rolling down this

00:22:26.944 --> 00:22:32.847
hill into the abyss of modern
subjectivism in philosophy and

00:22:32.847 --> 00:22:35.450
nihilistic politics.
 

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:40.578
Pretty depressing story you
might think.

00:22:40.578 --> 00:22:44.771
So that's one symptom,
that we live in this what

00:22:44.771 --> 00:22:49.589
MacIntyre wants to describe as
an emotivist culture.

00:22:49.589 --> 00:22:53.390
 
 

00:22:53.390 --> 00:23:00.863
Another symptom of it,
which you might not find as

00:23:00.863 --> 00:23:06.660
dispiriting as what I've just
said,

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:11.048
is what we--this isn't
MacIntyre's terminology,

00:23:11.048 --> 00:23:15.280
but I think it makes the
point--is a world in which

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.990
instrumentalism has triumphed.
 

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:25.200
A world in which there has been
a total separation between means

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.460
and ends.
 

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:32.805
One symptom of this,
again, not one he mentions in

00:23:32.805 --> 00:23:38.064
his book,
but I think captures neatly

00:23:38.064 --> 00:23:45.609
what he's talking about is the
proliferation of business

00:23:45.609 --> 00:23:47.118
schools.
 

00:23:47.118 --> 00:23:51.219
A hundred years ago there was
no such thing as a business

00:23:51.219 --> 00:23:53.048
school in a university.
 

00:23:53.048 --> 00:23:57.214
Nobody had ever thought of the
idea of even having a business

00:23:57.214 --> 00:23:57.839
school.
 

00:23:57.839 --> 00:24:00.900
 
 

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:06.185
And what's, I think,
notable about business schools

00:24:06.185 --> 00:24:13.058
is that they're teaching skills
that are unrelated to purposes.

00:24:13.058 --> 00:24:21.127
So business schools,
after all, are trying to teach

00:24:21.127 --> 00:24:27.098
people how to become good
managers.

00:24:27.098 --> 00:24:30.858
Whether you're going to manage
the Coca Cola Corporation,

00:24:30.858 --> 00:24:35.558
or whether you're going to
mange Goldman Sachs,

00:24:35.558 --> 00:24:39.700
or whether you're going to
manage a university.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:44.980
The assumption is there are
certain kinds of skills that

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:49.298
managers have,
that it's important to know.

00:24:49.298 --> 00:24:53.896
But business schools will not
teach you whether it's a good

00:24:53.896 --> 00:24:57.226
idea to manage Coca Cola,
or Goldman Sachs,

00:24:57.226 --> 00:24:59.048
or Yale University.
 

00:24:59.048 --> 00:25:03.828
That is not what business
schools are about.

00:25:03.828 --> 00:25:06.377
So business schools,
if you like,

00:25:06.377 --> 00:25:10.598
are predicated on the divorcing
of means from ends.

00:25:10.598 --> 00:25:19.344
They're teaching certain kinds
of instrumental skills that you

00:25:19.344 --> 00:25:27.801
can find helpful regardless of
what the enterprise is you're

00:25:27.801 --> 00:25:31.960
going to end up managing.
 

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:36.048
 
 

00:25:36.048 --> 00:25:41.500
Being a good manager is being
somebody who is inherently an

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.568
instrumental person.
 

00:25:43.568 --> 00:25:48.349
And of course that leaves
unanswered the question,

00:25:48.349 --> 00:25:53.715
"Well, but shouldn't we
attend to what it is we are

00:25:53.715 --> 00:25:55.568
managing?"
 

00:25:55.568 --> 00:25:59.132
After all, that was a question
that came up in our very first

00:25:59.132 --> 00:26:02.396
lecture in this course when we
talked about the Eichmann

00:26:02.396 --> 00:26:05.170
problem;
that he didn't care.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:06.730
He wanted to do well.
 

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:08.220
He wanted to impress his
superiors.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.900
He wanted to get an A.
 

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:13.675
He was happy shipping Jews
around the Third Reich to

00:26:13.675 --> 00:26:16.858
concentration camps as well as
he could,

00:26:16.858 --> 00:26:21.088
but he would have been equally
happy shipping munitions parts,

00:26:21.088 --> 00:26:25.608
or for that matter office
supplies.

00:26:25.608 --> 00:26:28.910
It wasn't important as far as
he was concerned.

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:32.509
He wanted to be a good manager.
 

00:26:32.509 --> 00:26:35.843
So this is a very
twentieth-century kind of

00:26:35.843 --> 00:26:38.858
preoccupation that we put the
goal,

00:26:38.858 --> 00:26:45.160
the purpose,
the ultimate endeavor aside,

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.250
and we say, "What are the
characteristics of being an

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:49.660
effective manager?"
 

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:58.296
To use the philosophical jargon
it is an erratically

00:26:58.296 --> 00:27:02.528
anti-teleological view.
 

00:27:02.528 --> 00:27:06.040
Teleology, teleological,
have I told you what

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.311
teleological--what does
teleological mean,

00:27:09.311 --> 00:27:10.348
somebody?
 

00:27:10.348 --> 00:27:11.868
Student:
&gt;

00:27:11.868 --> 00:27:13.742
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Right, telos comes from the

00:27:13.742 --> 00:27:14.890
Greek word telos or purpose.
 

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:18.098
Goal-directed, right?
 

00:27:18.098 --> 00:27:27.468
MacIntyre thinks that the
rejection of teleology is a huge

00:27:27.468 --> 00:27:37.000
problematic enduring mistake,
and I'm going to come back to

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.108
why in a few minutes.
 

00:27:41.108 --> 00:27:45.579
But first I want to return to
the first symptom I mentioned of

00:27:45.579 --> 00:27:46.460
our times.
 

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:50.409
There are these two symptoms,
the rise of subjectivism and

00:27:50.409 --> 00:27:54.567
emotivism and the nihilistic
kinds of politics it brings with

00:27:54.567 --> 00:27:58.250
it on the one hand,
and secondly this rejection of

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:02.914
teleology on the other hand,
and I'll say a little bit more

00:28:02.914 --> 00:28:04.680
about each of them.
 

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:10.752
"Neither of them is what
is seems,"

00:28:10.752 --> 00:28:13.098
says MacIntyre.
 

00:28:13.098 --> 00:28:18.452
Who knows what the TV program
that used to be on CNN for a

00:28:18.452 --> 00:28:22.210
long time called
Crossfire was?

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:25.720
Anybody, anyone ever see
Crossfire on CNN?

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.680
Yeah? Tell us how it works.
 

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.839
Take the microphone and tell us
how it works.

00:28:30.839 --> 00:28:32.250
How did it work?
 

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:32.833
Student:
&gt;

00:28:32.833 --> 00:28:33.400
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Anyone?

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.352
You might be too young.
 

00:28:35.352 --> 00:28:36.880
It's kind of sad.
 

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.107
Yeah, some of you might not be
quite too young.

00:28:39.107 --> 00:28:39.980
How did it work?
 

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.788
Student: I think it was like a
point-counterpoint exchange.

00:28:41.788 --> 00:28:43.348
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Yeah, so how did it work?

00:28:43.348 --> 00:28:46.567
Student: So I'm not sure going
into it whether you knew which

00:28:46.567 --> 00:28:49.836
side you--you definitely had to
have known which side you were

00:28:49.836 --> 00:28:50.910
debating, or no?
 

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:52.200
Do they just kind of give it to
you,

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.568
and then you either debate for
or against a certain thing,

00:28:55.568 --> 00:28:58.425
and then there was a judge at
the end who decided who the

00:28:58.425 --> 00:28:59.088
winner was?
 

00:28:59.088 --> 00:29:02.026
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Basically, except for your last

00:29:02.026 --> 00:29:02.470
point.
 

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:03.778
There was no winner.
 

00:29:03.778 --> 00:29:05.348
I'll come back to that.
 

00:29:05.348 --> 00:29:07.118
But basically you've got it
right.

00:29:07.118 --> 00:29:11.874
The idea was they have a
left-wing host and a right-wing

00:29:11.874 --> 00:29:12.480
host.
 

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:16.521
So they would have Robert Novak
as the right-wing host and

00:29:16.521 --> 00:29:19.391
Michael Kinsley,
say somebody like that,

00:29:19.391 --> 00:29:24.720
as the left-wing host,
and there would be some topic

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.069
du jour,
whether it was partial birth

00:29:28.069 --> 00:29:30.915
abortion,
or whatever it was,

00:29:30.915 --> 00:29:33.058
affirmative action.
 

00:29:33.058 --> 00:29:39.404
And what would happen was they
would then usually have two

00:29:39.404 --> 00:29:45.192
guests, and the guests were
chosen also to be sort of

00:29:45.192 --> 00:29:48.308
ideologically different.
 

00:29:48.308 --> 00:29:55.557
And the Novak type person would
fire questions at the left-wing

00:29:55.557 --> 00:29:57.887
guest,
and the Kinsley like person

00:29:57.887 --> 00:30:00.634
would fire questions to the
right-wing guest and they would

00:30:00.634 --> 00:30:04.727
argue back and forth,
and it would get more and more

00:30:04.727 --> 00:30:07.150
voluble and impassioned.
 

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:15.049
And then at two minutes to
eight the commercial would come

00:30:15.049 --> 00:30:18.099
on and it would end.
 

00:30:18.099 --> 00:30:19.720
Why do I bring this up?
 

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:24.760
I bring this up because of
MacIntyre's observation right at

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.976
the beginning of the book where
he says there's a certain odd

00:30:29.976 --> 00:30:34.670
feature to moral argument in
this emotivist world.

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:36.785
There's a strange feature.
 

00:30:36.785 --> 00:30:40.690
On the one hand it's
subjectivist in all the ways

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:42.480
we've talked about.
 

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:47.509
Everybody's views are equal to
everybody else's.

00:30:47.509 --> 00:30:52.578
There's no authoritative figure.
 

00:30:52.578 --> 00:30:55.740
There's no authoritative figure
to settle our disagreements,

00:30:55.740 --> 00:31:01.532
at least not an earthly one,
and everybody is what they are

00:31:01.532 --> 00:31:05.028
and who they are and that's
that.

00:31:05.028 --> 00:31:06.603
On the other hand,
MacIntyre says,

00:31:06.603 --> 00:31:08.750
"If you look at things
like abortion,

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:11.798
or affirmative action,
or nuclear weapons,

00:31:11.798 --> 00:31:18.991
people argue about these
questions as though there were a

00:31:18.991 --> 00:31:21.690
right answer."
 

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:23.670
They give reasons for their
views.

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:26.460
They try to show the other side
as being hypocritical.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:29.303
They want to say,
"My premises are more

00:31:29.303 --> 00:31:31.750
plausible than your
premises."

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:35.858
They argue with each other as
though there were an answer to

00:31:35.858 --> 00:31:38.645
this question,
should we outlaw abortion,

00:31:38.645 --> 00:31:41.920
or should we outlaw partial
birth abortion.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:45.381
The arguments they get into
suggest that everybody's

00:31:45.381 --> 00:31:48.640
assuming there is an answer to
that question,

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.670
 
 

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:54.950
but actually nobody expects the
question to be resolved.

00:31:54.950 --> 00:32:01.286
And that's why I mentioned the
Crossfire because what

00:32:01.286 --> 00:32:07.298
could never have happened on
that TV show is sort of,

00:32:07.298 --> 00:32:14.078
at 7:46, Michael Kinsley
turning to Novak and saying,

00:32:14.078 --> 00:32:18.318
"Hmm, you know,
I never thought of that.

00:32:18.318 --> 00:32:22.509
Actually maybe you're
right."

00:32:22.509 --> 00:32:25.888
If they did that,
first of all the sponsors would

00:32:25.888 --> 00:32:27.650
pull their commercials.
 

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:29.528
Kinsley would be fired.
 

00:32:29.528 --> 00:32:35.459
That's not what it's about,
but then it's bizarre,

00:32:35.459 --> 00:32:36.788
isn't it?
 

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:42.859
Because if everybody agrees
that we're all subjectivists and

00:32:42.859 --> 00:32:48.519
that all our views are equally
tenable or untenable,

00:32:48.519 --> 00:32:53.037
which they seem to,
then why is everybody going

00:32:53.037 --> 00:32:57.259
through the motions of arguing
like this?

00:32:57.259 --> 00:33:00.066
Why is everybody saying,
"You don't make any sense,

00:33:00.066 --> 00:33:02.463
and this is misuse of evidence,
and you're blah,

00:33:02.463 --> 00:33:03.230
blah, blah.
 

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:06.068
And look, my argument's much
stronger, and blah."

00:33:06.068 --> 00:33:12.440
Why would anybody bother if we
really believed the subjectivism

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.140
which we seem to take for
granted?

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:19.960
 
 

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:24.890
That, for MacIntyre,
is the real symptom of what's

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:28.009
wrong with our circumstances.
 

00:33:28.009 --> 00:33:32.778
The fact that we engage in
interminable moral arguments

00:33:32.778 --> 00:33:38.430
that we do not expect to be able
to resolve is the symptom of the

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:43.641
malady of our time in his view
because it suggests a kind of

00:33:43.641 --> 00:33:48.410
thirst and a set of expectations
from the past,

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:52.488
he wants to say,
that we need to be able to

00:33:52.488 --> 00:33:53.460
recover.
 

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:59.064
Because the fact that we carry
on arguing suggests we don't

00:33:59.064 --> 00:34:02.930
want to accept this emotivist
culture.

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.568
We're not comfortable with it.
 

00:34:04.568 --> 00:34:09.557
It's not emotionally,
morally, psychologically,

00:34:09.557 --> 00:34:13.137
philosophically,
satisfying to us,

00:34:13.137 --> 00:34:15.739
not even acceptable.
 

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:23.094
But so he thinks one of the
things we need to be able to do

00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:29.650
is account for this puzzle,
this puzzle that we engage in

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:35.438
moral argument using the forms
of persuasive reasoning that we

00:34:35.438 --> 00:34:38.949
don't actually expect to
resolve,

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:45.610
so that moral argument has this
quality of Crossfire.

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:54.342
So that's the one thing that we
need to get some kind of grip on

00:34:54.342 --> 00:35:01.965
if we're going to understand
what's wrong with emotivist

00:35:01.965 --> 00:35:03.630
culture.
 

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:09.150
The second is this problem with
teleology.

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:15.563
They turn out to be related,
but here's the problem with

00:35:15.563 --> 00:35:18.130
rejecting teleology.
 

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:26.702
If I walked in here one morning
and got up on this stage and I

00:35:26.702 --> 00:35:32.907
said to you,
"Well, this morning I got

00:35:32.907 --> 00:35:35.355
up,
got dressed,

00:35:35.355 --> 00:35:40.210
went for a run,
came back home,

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:42.329
took a shower,
got dressed again,

00:35:42.329 --> 00:35:44.780
started walking down to the
office.

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:48.045
I crossed down to Orange
Street, and then I crossed

00:35:48.045 --> 00:35:50.590
Cannon Street,
and I got down to Whitney

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:51.309
Avenue.
 

00:35:51.309 --> 00:35:55.065
At some point pretty soon you'd
say, "What is the point of

00:35:55.065 --> 00:35:55.489
this?
 

00:35:55.489 --> 00:35:58.579
Why is he telling us this?"
 

00:35:58.579 --> 00:36:05.840
 
 

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.469
Human beings always want to
know the purpose.

00:36:09.469 --> 00:36:11.619
What is the point?
 

00:36:11.619 --> 00:36:20.219
So we will never be satisfied
with any activity that is

00:36:20.219 --> 00:36:26.429
pointless, that doesn't have a
point.

00:36:26.429 --> 00:36:32.338
And the Enlightenment endeavor
of trying to be agnostic about

00:36:32.338 --> 00:36:37.755
purposes and scientific about
means is never going to be

00:36:37.755 --> 00:36:41.400
satisfying to us for that
reason.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:44.750
People want to know the point.
 

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:50.349
They want to believe their
existences have a point,

00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:55.726
and if they don't they become
disaffected, bored,

00:36:55.726 --> 00:36:59.309
agitated, unhappy,
or worse.

00:36:59.309 --> 00:37:07.650
 
 

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:12.760
MacIntyre actually has a
brilliant little essay called

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:18.452
Epistemological Crises and
Dramatic Narratives

00:37:18.452 --> 00:37:23.949
where he points out that if a
young child asks you why the

00:37:23.949 --> 00:37:27.949
earth doesn't fall down,
you tell them,

00:37:27.949 --> 00:37:31.559
say, a story that it's being
held up by a giant,

00:37:31.559 --> 00:37:34.570
giant's holding the earth in
his hands,

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:37.590
that's why it doesn't fall down.
 

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:42.023
That's adequate for a while,
and then they ask for another

00:37:42.023 --> 00:37:45.369
story when they stop believing
in giants.

00:37:45.369 --> 00:37:48.547
But his claim is,
it's something about the

00:37:48.547 --> 00:37:53.275
structure of human psychology
that even explanations rooted in

00:37:53.275 --> 00:37:57.230
physics ultimately take the form
of narratives.

00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:02.141
People want to be able to tell
a story that we fit into,

00:38:02.141 --> 00:38:08.170
that has some point or purpose;
that our basic understanding of

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:13.737
the world is as teleological
purposive creatures who tell

00:38:13.737 --> 00:38:18.409
narratives to give point to
their existence.

00:38:18.409 --> 00:38:25.481
And we're going to become
uncomfortable if we don't have a

00:38:25.481 --> 00:38:31.559
way of understanding politics
that has a point.

00:38:31.559 --> 00:38:37.679
So that is the symptom of our
plight,

00:38:37.679 --> 00:38:41.090
that we live in this emotivist
world that we can't accept,

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:44.333
and we have this bizarre
love-hate relationship with it

00:38:44.333 --> 00:38:47.697
when you look at the kinds of
moral arguments we actually

00:38:47.697 --> 00:38:48.539
engage in.
 

00:38:48.539 --> 00:38:53.318
And secondly we live in this
world in which we have tried to

00:38:53.318 --> 00:38:57.855
cope with the deep pluralism
Rawls writes about by taking

00:38:57.855 --> 00:39:02.844
goals off the table,
purposes off the table and

00:39:02.844 --> 00:39:06.949
seeing can we just be
instrumental.

00:39:06.949 --> 00:39:09.974
So if you want another
political theorist we don't have

00:39:09.974 --> 00:39:13.226
time to read,
but who has a good one liner to

00:39:13.226 --> 00:39:16.800
capture what MacIntyre thinks is
the problem,

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:20.842
it's Rousseau's line in the
first paragraph of The Social

00:39:20.842 --> 00:39:25.266
Contract where he says,
he's going to come up with a

00:39:25.266 --> 00:39:30.172
design of institutions for
society "taking men as they

00:39:30.172 --> 00:39:33.469
are and laws as they might
be."

00:39:33.469 --> 00:39:37.750
Taking men as they are and laws
as they might be,

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:42.730
and the reason MacIntyre would
think that problematic is,

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:47.079
taking men as they are,
men and women we might say

00:39:47.079 --> 00:39:49.490
today,
as they are,

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:57.148
ignores important questions
about how they have come to be

00:39:57.148 --> 00:40:04.938
as they are and what the role of
morality is in shaping and

00:40:04.938 --> 00:40:08.699
reshaping human nature.
 

00:40:08.699 --> 00:40:14.210
So the title of the book is
After Virtue,

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:23.030
and virtue, what modern
philosophers call virtue ethics,

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:26.085
come out of a different
tradition than anything we've

00:40:26.085 --> 00:40:28.320
considered thus far in this
course,

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.840
namely the Aristotelian
tradition.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:35.389
Aristotle was the person who
talked about the virtues,

00:40:35.389 --> 00:40:41.869
and what MacIntyre wants to say
is,

00:40:41.869 --> 00:40:47.224
"We are at some important
level that we don't fully

00:40:47.224 --> 00:40:53.434
appreciate or understand,
products or the inheritors of a

00:40:53.434 --> 00:40:58.719
kind of degraded Aristotelian
tradition."

00:40:58.719 --> 00:41:02.643
We have taken over concepts and
categories for thinking about

00:41:02.643 --> 00:41:05.389
ethics from the Aristotelian
tradition,

00:41:05.389 --> 00:41:09.820
but in a way that has become
degraded,

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:17.755
in a way that abandons the most
important assumptions behind the

00:41:17.755 --> 00:41:24.809
Aristotelian tradition that make
it all hang together.

00:41:24.809 --> 00:41:30.702
And the two key notions,
the two analytical devices that

00:41:30.702 --> 00:41:36.811
make this argument work are what
he calls a practice and a

00:41:36.811 --> 00:41:37.989
virtue.
 

00:41:37.989 --> 00:41:42.487
Practice comes first,
and I'll say a little bit about

00:41:42.487 --> 00:41:45.280
that,
and then I'll say a little bit

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.682
about virtues,
and then we'll go into his

00:41:48.682 --> 00:41:52.018
argument in more detail on
Wednesday.

00:41:52.018 --> 00:41:55.726
A practice he says here,
"Any coherent and complex

00:41:55.726 --> 00:41:59.432
form of socially established
cooperative human activity

00:41:59.432 --> 00:42:02.728
through which goods internal to
that activity are

00:42:02.728 --> 00:42:04.170
realized."
 

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:07.469
Not an engaging sentence.
 

00:42:07.469 --> 00:42:13.268
Let me try and give it content
for you, so first of all the

00:42:13.268 --> 00:42:15.369
idea of a practice.
 

00:42:15.369 --> 00:42:20.480
This is the intuition.
 

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:26.606
When you walk into a class at
Yale for the first time,

00:42:26.606 --> 00:42:32.619
say, as a freshman,
think about what you don't do.

00:42:32.619 --> 00:42:36.934
You don't say to yourself,
"How should this class be

00:42:36.934 --> 00:42:37.860
run?"
 

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:42.041
You don't immediately interrupt
other people and say,

00:42:42.041 --> 00:42:45.820
"Let's all decide how to
run this class.

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.969
Shall we vote on it?
 

00:42:48.969 --> 00:42:50.809
Shall we talk about it?"
 

00:42:50.809 --> 00:42:53.360
That's not what you do, right?
 

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:57.780
When you walk into your first
Yale class as a freshman you sit

00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:01.547
down, you look around,
you say, "What's going on

00:43:01.547 --> 00:43:02.199
here?
 

00:43:02.199 --> 00:43:03.119
What are the norms?
 

00:43:03.119 --> 00:43:07.099
What's expected of me?
 

00:43:07.099 --> 00:43:09.710
What am I supposed to do?"
 

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:12.940
That's what you say to yourself.
 

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:17.440
So right there MacIntyre wants
to say the social contract

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:21.768
metaphor is really bad,
it's the misleading of the

00:43:21.768 --> 00:43:27.369
human experience because people
don't create tabula rasa.

00:43:27.369 --> 00:43:32.101
Rather people are born into
practices that they inherit from

00:43:32.101 --> 00:43:35.389
the past and reproduce into the
future.

00:43:35.389 --> 00:43:40.570
A practice, it's complicated.
 

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:42.469
It's already socially
established.

00:43:42.469 --> 00:43:45.170
It's ongoing when you discover
it.

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:48.246
People have been teaching
courses at Yale for centuries

00:43:48.246 --> 00:43:51.496
and there have been freshmen who
have walked into them and

00:43:51.496 --> 00:43:54.139
saying,
"What do I do now?

00:43:54.139 --> 00:43:56.610
What's expected of me?"
 

00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:00.460
So the point is that the
practice precedes the

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:03.969
participants,
not the other way around.

00:44:03.969 --> 00:44:10.713
So that's the first idea,
a coherent and complex--it's

00:44:10.713 --> 00:44:16.440
coherent in that it has some
goal, purpose.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:20.130
 
 

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:22.702
Enlightenment,
let's say, is the purpose in

00:44:22.702 --> 00:44:25.766
this course, not in the sense of
the Enlightenment,

00:44:25.766 --> 00:44:27.300
but enlightening you.
 

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:31.643
Socially established,
it's cooperative that

00:44:31.643 --> 00:44:37.023
everybody, he wants to say
practices are not coercive

00:44:37.023 --> 00:44:42.610
(we'll come back to that later),
it's cooperative.

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:47.306
Human activity through which
goods internal to that activity

00:44:47.306 --> 00:44:48.500
are realized.
 

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.949
So that's an important term,
internal.

00:44:51.949 --> 00:44:55.420
 
 

00:44:55.420 --> 00:45:03.369
And here he has in mind let's
suppose you're playing chess.

00:45:03.369 --> 00:45:07.347
You're playing chess with me
and I have to go and answer the

00:45:07.347 --> 00:45:09.639
phone in the middle of the game.
 

00:45:09.639 --> 00:45:15.141
And while I'm not in the room
you take one of my pawns off the

00:45:15.141 --> 00:45:18.119
board, I come back and you win.
 

00:45:18.119 --> 00:45:21.730
That's not playing by the rules.
 

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:24.840
That's not an internal
realization of a good.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:28.280
That's what we would call in
his terminology,

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.079
"External."
 

00:45:30.079 --> 00:45:35.333
So the idea of a practice is
there are rules constituting the

00:45:35.333 --> 00:45:38.659
practice by which you have to
excel.

00:45:38.659 --> 00:45:41.329
 
 

00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:43.719
So you have to learn the rules.
 

00:45:43.719 --> 00:45:46.110
Cheating doesn't count.
 

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:49.489
So that's the notion of a
practice.

00:45:49.489 --> 00:45:54.369
I'll go into it in more detail.
 

00:45:54.369 --> 00:45:58.610
Virtues are what give practices
their point.

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:03.349
Virtues have to do with the
goals imminent in practices.

00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:06.500
He says a virtue is "an
acquired human quality,

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:11.119
the possession and exercise of
which tends to enable us to

00:46:11.119 --> 00:46:15.818
achieve those goods which are
internal to practices and the

00:46:15.818 --> 00:46:20.275
lack of which effectively
prevents us from achieving any

00:46:20.275 --> 00:46:22.139
such goods."
 

00:46:22.139 --> 00:46:29.969
So, I'll leave you with this
thought and we'll pick up from

00:46:29.969 --> 00:46:32.400
it on Wednesday.
 

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:37.029
"What human beings want is
to excel internally in

00:46:37.029 --> 00:46:40.000
practices,"
says MacIntyre.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.858
You've all heard the phrase
"he's a pitchers'

00:46:43.858 --> 00:46:45.119
pitcher."
 

00:46:45.119 --> 00:46:49.445
When we say "he's a
pitchers' pitcher"

00:46:49.445 --> 00:46:54.876
what we have in mind is the
notion that he's so skilled that

00:46:54.876 --> 00:47:00.400
only a true pro can appreciate
how skilled he really is.

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:06.409
So if I write books and I also
build sheds,

00:47:06.409 --> 00:47:09.567
if I show my books to people
who know how to build sheds and

00:47:09.567 --> 00:47:10.998
they say,
"Oh yeah,

00:47:10.998 --> 00:47:13.989
a really good book,"
and I show my carpentry to a

00:47:13.989 --> 00:47:16.360
bunch of nerdy academics and
they say,

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.992
"Oh, that's really
good," that's not going to

00:47:19.992 --> 00:47:24.230
be satisfying to me because I
want to be a pitchers' pitcher.

00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:28.099
I want people who know about
books to be impressed with my

00:47:28.099 --> 00:47:31.764
books, and I want people who
know about carpentry to be

00:47:31.764 --> 00:47:33.530
impressed by my sheds.
 

00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:38.934
That's the notion of internal
goods that every practice has

00:47:38.934 --> 00:47:44.619
goods by reference to which you
excel within that practice.

00:47:44.619 --> 00:47:47.489
You don't want to win at chess
by stealing the pawn when the

00:47:47.489 --> 00:47:48.610
person's not looking.
 

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:53.603
You want to beat them in terms
of the norms and rules of

00:47:53.603 --> 00:47:55.510
playing good chess.
 

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:59.139
So the notion is you walk into
the classroom,

00:47:59.139 --> 00:48:03.347
you want to get an A,
but not by downloading a paper

00:48:03.347 --> 00:48:05.079
off the internet.
 

00:48:05.079 --> 00:48:09.222
You want to get the A by
reference to the norms and

00:48:09.222 --> 00:48:13.530
practices governing what goes on
in the classroom.

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:18.039
So that's the basic idea of
virtues being internal to

00:48:18.039 --> 00:48:21.510
practices and giving them their
point.

00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:25.210
And MacIntyre wants to say that
these two terms,

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:29.746
these practices and virtues
capture a lot more that is

00:48:29.746 --> 00:48:35.056
relevant about human psychology
than the assumptions that drove

00:48:35.056 --> 00:48:36.940
the Enlightenment.
 

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:38.690
And we'll start with that on
Wednesday.

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:44.000

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.442
Prof: Okay,
so I'm going to begin with

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:07.872
something I did last time,
because it was not completed,

00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:09.670
then we'll take it from there.
 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.817
And we had a lot more questions
last time, which is good,

00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:15.290
very helpful,
so I know what may be bothering

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.740
you.
 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.800
So don't hesitate to stop me.
 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.940
The new thing we did last time
was,

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.390
if I give you some wave
function, ψ(x),

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.110
and I ask you what happens if I
measured energy,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.130
the recipe is the same as in
momentum.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.870
You've got to find functions
called

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.763
ψ_E(x),
which are supposed to be states

00:00:43.763 --> 00:00:46.077
in which,
if the electron was there,

00:00:46.077 --> 00:00:48.140
it'll have a definite energy.
 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.550
Now, not worrying for a moment
on how you get them,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.268
the recipe for what happens
when you measure energy is that

00:00:57.268 --> 00:01:00.408
if you're given some arbitrary
function ψ,

00:01:00.408 --> 00:01:02.600
that's a state the particle is
in.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.102
And you're asking,
"What happens if I measure

00:01:04.102 --> 00:01:04.379
energy?
 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.709
What will I get?"
 

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:10.623
The instruction is to write
that function as a sum over

00:01:10.623 --> 00:01:14.899
these functions,
each associated with a definite

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:15.900
energy.
 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.272
And once you have done that,
the probability that you will

00:01:20.272 --> 00:01:24.875
get a certain energy E =
the absolute value squared of

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:27.330
that particular coefficient.
 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.322
Not different from
ψ_p ,

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:29.970
same rule.
 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.150
And the rule for
A_E is also the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.410
same, or similar.
 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.200
A_E is the
integral of complex conjugate of

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.349
this function associated with
definite energy,

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:44.310
times the function you're
thinking about,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.209
integrated over space.
 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:50.830
It's the same rule.
 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.617
So it can happen,
the problem can take many

00:01:53.617 --> 00:01:54.150
forms.
 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.470
Sometimes one can give you a
function ψ(x).

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.659
Then you take all these
functions, do all these

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.126
integrals, find all the
coefficients and you square

00:02:05.126 --> 00:02:05.750
them.
 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.158
Other times the coefficients
may be given to you;

00:02:08.158 --> 00:02:10.467
you're just asked,
"What's the odd for this

00:02:10.467 --> 00:02:11.938
energy or that energy?"
 

00:02:11.938 --> 00:02:14.650
But now the question is,
what are these functions,

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.310
ψ_E(x).
 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.360
Whereas functions of definite
momentum are given once and for

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.346
all by this formula,
e^(ipx/ℏ),

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:31.258
I wish I could give you a
function of definite energy and

00:02:31.258 --> 00:02:33.080
say,
"These are functions of

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.758
definite energy.
 

00:02:33.758 --> 00:02:35.866
Maybe instead of p,
there'll be some E on

00:02:35.866 --> 00:02:36.490
the top."
 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.370
No, it's not like that.
 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.459
You've got to do a lot more
work, because the reason is that

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.825
the functions of definite energy
depend on what the energy is in

00:02:46.825 --> 00:02:48.490
classical mechanics.
 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.288
And in classical mechanics,
the energy depends on the

00:02:52.288 --> 00:02:55.139
momentum and on the potential
energy.

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.470
That means on the position.
 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.370
Every problem has a different
formula for E.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.207
If it's a harmonic oscillator,
this will be

00:03:05.207 --> 00:03:06.830
½kx^(2).
 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.116
If it's a particle moving up
and down in gravity,

00:03:10.116 --> 00:03:11.830
it could be mgy.
 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.377
If it's two particles connected
by a spring, it will be

00:03:14.377 --> 00:03:15.180
something else.
 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.750
So in each problem,
our electron in Hydrogen atom,

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.240
is the coulomb force,
coulomb potential,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.244
e_1e
_2/r^(2)

00:03:24.244 --> 00:03:25.158
times some 4Π's.
 

00:03:25.158 --> 00:03:27.331
So in each problem,
there's a different V

00:03:27.331 --> 00:03:29.366
and for each V,
you've got to find the

00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:31.169
E--I mean,
you've got to find the

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:31.909
functions.
 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.530
And what is the rule?
 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.930
The rule is the following.
 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.840
You have to solve the following
equation,

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.229
called the Schrödinger
equation,

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:55.532
d^(2)ψ/dx^(2) 
V(x)ψ(x) = E

00:03:55.532 --> 00:03:58.571
times--
you just have to solve this

00:03:58.571 --> 00:03:58.889
equation.
 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.639
So let's not worry about how
you solve it.

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.901
That's a problem in
mathematics, but the point is

00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:06.820
that,
given a potential V,

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.467
you come to this equation,
and you go to the math

00:04:09.467 --> 00:04:12.335
department and say,
"Give me all the solutions

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:13.780
of this equation."
 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.408
And they'll give you all the
solutions of the equation.

00:04:15.408 --> 00:04:17.848
They will find,
in fact, only for certain

00:04:17.848 --> 00:04:21.386
special values of E that
the equation has acceptable

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:22.240
solutions.
 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.884
And for each one,
they'll give you the solution

00:04:24.884 --> 00:04:27.990
and you start with that solution
and do all of this.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.689
You follow that?
 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:33.519
That's the program.
 

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:37.714
So I did a very simple example
last time, which was two

00:04:37.714 --> 00:04:38.569
examples.
 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.728
First I said,
take the problem with no

00:04:41.728 --> 00:04:46.339
potential, no force,
particle is free of all forces.

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:51.067
Then the equation is very
simple, -ℏ^(2)/2m

00:04:51.067 --> 00:04:54.124
d^(2)ψ--
I'm sorry,

00:04:54.124 --> 00:04:57.360
d^(2)ψ/dx^(2).
 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.079
There is no Vψ.
 

00:04:59.079 --> 00:05:04.069
That is just Eψ.
 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:09.343
So let's rearrange this to the
following form:

00:05:09.343 --> 00:05:15.439
d^(2)ψ/dx^(2)  
k^(2)ψ = 0,

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:26.278
where k^(2) is just
2mE/ℏ^(2).

00:05:26.278 --> 00:05:29.298
You know if you multiply by
2m/ℏ^(2),

00:05:29.298 --> 00:05:31.110
you'll get this equation.
 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.678
Since this combination appears
all the time,

00:05:33.678 --> 00:05:36.129
I want to give it a name,
k^(2).

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:39.475
But you must understand,
what's the relation of k

00:05:39.475 --> 00:05:42.759
to anything else you know will
be clear in a minute.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.100
So what's the solution to this
one?

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.209
You can write them in terms of
sines and cosines,

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:51.838
but I want to write them in
terms of exponentials and the

00:05:51.838 --> 00:05:54.560
solution was--there are two
solutions.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.692
One is e^(ikx),
where k is defined that

00:05:58.692 --> 00:05:59.170
way.
 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.269
Other is e^(-ikx).
 

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:04.579
You can check.
 

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:08.321
If you took this function and
take two derivatives of either

00:06:08.321 --> 00:06:11.245
this term of that term,
both will give you

00:06:11.245 --> 00:06:14.579
−k^(2) times the
function itself.

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:17.252
Every time you take a
derivative, you bring down an

00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:18.750
ik or a -ik.
 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.240
If you do it twice,
it's −k^(2).

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.699
And A and B are
arbitrary right now.

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:28.040
There is no restriction coming
from that equation.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.829
And what is k?
 

00:06:29.829 --> 00:06:33.057
You know that functions of
definite momentum look like

00:06:33.057 --> 00:06:36.041
e^(ipx/ℏ),
and I have something that says

00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:37.199
e^(ikx).
 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:42.081
It's very clear that p
is just ℏk,

00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:45.069
or k is p/ℏ.
 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:48.468
So if you like,
this equation I got,

00:06:48.468 --> 00:06:52.062
we can write as
ℏ^(2)k^(2) is

00:06:52.062 --> 00:06:53.519
2mE.
 

00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:56.420
That means p^(2) is
2mE.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:02.560
That means E =
p^(2)/2m.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.540
So let's understand what that
means.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:04.970
Yes.
 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.910
Student: Just jumping
back for a second.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.956
At the bottom of the top board,
you wrote the E for

00:07:10.956 --> 00:07:12.519
classical mechanics.
 

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:16.500
Did the equation to the right
of that come from that?

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.490
Prof: In a way, it does.
 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:18.930
That's correct.
 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.310
I will tell you how it does.
 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.259
But right now,
I'm just giving you a recipe.

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:28.863
If in classical mechanics,
you know what the kinetic and

00:07:28.863 --> 00:07:31.420
potential energy of the particle
are.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.079
Kinetic is always
p^(2)/2m.

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:35.949
Potential is V(x) where
V depends on the context.

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:39.276
Then in the quantum theory,
the functions of definite

00:07:39.276 --> 00:07:42.985
energy obey an equation which
looks a lot like that in many

00:07:42.985 --> 00:07:44.009
ways, right?
 

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:48.036
So I've given you some clues or
some more discretion in my notes

00:07:48.036 --> 00:07:51.809
on what is the universal recipe
for guessing the equation in

00:07:51.809 --> 00:07:52.959
every context.
 

00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:55.579
I'll talk about it a little bit.
 

00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:59.238
But right now,
you can take the view that this

00:07:59.238 --> 00:08:04.117
guy just tells me that if you
want states of definite energy,

00:08:04.117 --> 00:08:06.069
solve that equation.
 

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:08.379
Look, so what is this saying?
 

00:08:08.379 --> 00:08:09.060
Think about this.
 

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.836
It's saying,
if you want a state of definite

00:08:10.836 --> 00:08:13.514
energy,
it is really made up of states

00:08:13.514 --> 00:08:17.637
of definite momentum,
and the momenta that appear

00:08:17.637 --> 00:08:19.759
here are not arbitrary.
 

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:21.920
They are simply the momenta
that you will have,

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.259
even in classical mechanics,
for that definite energy,

00:08:25.259 --> 00:08:27.528
because if E is
p^(2)/2m,

00:08:27.528 --> 00:08:30.490
p would be
ï¿½√2mE.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.668
That's exactly what we have.
 

00:08:32.668 --> 00:08:38.041
If k = here,…
this says k =

00:08:38.041 --> 00:08:43.985
√2mE/â„ ,
and â„ k is just

00:08:43.985 --> 00:08:46.500
√2mE.
 

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.538
So that looks like classical
mechanics, right?

00:08:48.538 --> 00:08:50.572
Even before you took the
course, if I said there's a

00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:51.408
particle on a ring.
 

00:08:51.408 --> 00:08:54.570
Its energy is E,
what is its momentum?

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.220
You will say since energy is
p^(2)/2m,

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.464
p must be
ï¿½√2mE and they

00:09:00.464 --> 00:09:03.129
mean going one way,
and going the other way.

00:09:03.129 --> 00:09:05.678
These are the only two options.
 

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:08.350
That part is very much like
classical mechanics.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.695
The k is related to
E exactly the way it

00:09:11.695 --> 00:09:12.389
would be.
 

00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:18.057
What is novel here is that this
state, simultaneously can yield

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:24.000
either the clockwise momentum or
the counterclockwise momentum.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.399
That's the sense in which it's
a different thing,

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.250
you understand?
 

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.130
A classical particle of energy
E will have one of these

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.178
two momenta,
but on any given day,

00:09:32.178 --> 00:09:35.277
on any given trial,
it will have only one of these

00:09:35.277 --> 00:09:35.570
two.
 

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:36.870
It cannot have both the signs.
 

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.080
Either it's going like this or
going like that.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.710
In quantum theory,
it's in the state of limbo.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:45.357
Not this alone,
not that alone,

00:09:45.357 --> 00:09:46.210
both.
 

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.840
The probability of going
clockwise is proportional to

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.527
A^(2),
and the probability of going

00:09:51.527 --> 00:09:54.879
counterclockwise is proportional
to B^(2).

00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:56.591
If you want,
you can put the square root of

00:09:56.591 --> 00:09:58.537
L's and so on,
but they're all common to

00:09:58.537 --> 00:10:00.481
everything,
so the relative probability is

00:10:00.481 --> 00:10:03.080
just in the ratio of
A^(2) is to B^(2).

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.009
It's an admixture.
 

00:10:06.009 --> 00:10:09.355
And there is no restriction on
how much of A and how

00:10:09.355 --> 00:10:12.298
much of B you should put
into your answer.

00:10:12.298 --> 00:10:16.049
You can pick the extreme case
where only A is non-zero.

00:10:16.049 --> 00:10:17.120
That's fine.
 

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.645
That's a particle who has a
definite energy and a definite

00:10:21.645 --> 00:10:22.519
momentum.
 

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:25.261
You can pick this one,
a definite energy in the

00:10:25.261 --> 00:10:27.229
opposite momentum,
but in general,

00:10:27.229 --> 00:10:28.720
both can be non-zero.
 

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.371
It's a state of definite energy
whose momentum is known in

00:10:32.371 --> 00:10:35.703
magnitude but not in sign,
because both allowed signs

00:10:35.703 --> 00:10:36.730
appear here.
 

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.019
The other result from quantum
mechanics,

00:10:39.019 --> 00:10:42.428
which is surprising,
is whereas a particle in a ring

00:10:42.428 --> 00:10:45.267
can have any momentum,
in quantum theory,

00:10:45.267 --> 00:10:48.250
the demand that when you go
around the ring,

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.678
if you add an L to the
x,

00:10:50.678 --> 00:10:52.740
you should come back to the
same function,

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:59.096
makes the requirement that
kL is some multiple of

00:10:59.096 --> 00:11:04.528
2Π.That means k =
2Πn/L,

00:11:04.528 --> 00:11:10.418
or p is
2Πâ„ /L times

00:11:10.418 --> 00:11:12.168
n.
 

00:11:12.168 --> 00:11:14.429
The allowed values of k
or p are restricted in

00:11:14.429 --> 00:11:16.460
this way,
and the allowed values of

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.072
energy then,
which is p^(2)/2m,

00:11:20.072 --> 00:11:25.318
are restricted to be
4Π^(2)â„ ^(2) over

00:11:25.318 --> 00:11:31.440
2m L^(2) times an
integer n^(2).

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.440
And this is a problem where
energy is quantized.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.825
It's really quantized because
momentum is quantized and the

00:11:39.825 --> 00:11:44.210
energy in this simple example is
simply p^(2)/2m.

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.535
That means if you shine light
on the system,

00:11:46.535 --> 00:11:49.133
it will absorb light only at
certain frequencies,

00:11:49.133 --> 00:11:52.110
and it will emit light only at
certain frequencies.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.928
And what are those frequencies?
 

00:11:53.928 --> 00:11:57.110
Well, all of this there's a
bunch of numbers.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:58.590
ℏ, m, L they're not
changing.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:06.278
n can be 0 or - 1,
or - 2 etc.

00:12:06.278 --> 00:12:09.407
For every n you put in,
you'll get this basic number

00:12:09.407 --> 00:12:11.778
times 0 squared or 1 squared or
2 squared.

00:12:11.778 --> 00:12:16.000
So you will find that will be
the state E_0,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.548
which is n=0.
 

00:12:17.548 --> 00:12:22.119
Then above that,
the energy of that will be

00:12:22.119 --> 00:12:27.450
2Π^(2)â„ ^(2) over
mL squared.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:32.399
Then there'll be n=1,
and there'll be n=-1.

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:35.529
Both will have the same energy,
because energy depends only on

00:12:35.529 --> 00:12:36.298
n^(2).
 

00:12:36.298 --> 00:12:39.710
The energy of that will be--I'm
sorry.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.038
I made a mistake.
 

00:12:41.038 --> 00:12:46.636
E_0 is simply
0, because that corresponds to

00:12:46.636 --> 00:12:47.850
n=0.
 

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.960
E_1 will be
what I wrote here,

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.845
with n=1,
which will be

00:12:54.845 --> 00:13:03.100
2Π^(2)â„ ^(2) over
mL squared.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.197
So what I'm saying is,
at a given energy,

00:13:06.197 --> 00:13:09.916
you can have a state of right
moving clockwise or

00:13:09.916 --> 00:13:14.408
anticlockwise momentum,
or a crazy mixture of the two.

00:13:14.408 --> 00:13:15.976
But normally,
if you wish,

00:13:15.976 --> 00:13:19.298
you may select from these
mixtures, two special cases,

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:23.058
one which is all A and
one which is all B.

00:13:23.058 --> 00:13:25.770
We like those because now we
can visualize them as states

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:28.482
having a definite momentum
clockwise, a definite momentum

00:13:28.482 --> 00:13:29.500
counterclockwise.
 

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:34.436
That's what one really means by
drawing two lines at that

00:13:34.436 --> 00:13:35.230
energy.
 

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.307
So if you absorb a photon,
you've got to give an energy

00:13:38.307 --> 00:13:41.840
equal to the difference of these
two numbers, which is that.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.840
And that will be the
â„ ω of your

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.440
photon.
 

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.106
And if you emit a photon and
come from there down here,

00:13:48.106 --> 00:13:50.379
that photon frequency will be
given by that.

00:13:50.379 --> 00:13:52.740
So this is how a quantum system
is usually probed.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.990
We cannot actually look in and
see anything.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.207
We deal with it by shining
light and we see what light it

00:13:58.207 --> 00:13:59.990
absorbs, what light it emits.
 

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:04.240
The frequency of light is a
clue as to energy level

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.788
differences, you understand?
 

00:14:06.788 --> 00:14:08.990
Not to the energy themselves,
but to the energy level

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:10.808
difference that turns into
photon energy.

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:14.269
But you can put together the
levels by putting together all

00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:16.534
the differences,
so you measure all the

00:14:16.534 --> 00:14:17.490
differences.
 

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.850
So one famous line is the
hydrogen 21 centimeter line.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.373
Hydrogen atom has two levels
which are close,

00:14:23.373 --> 00:14:26.070
and the wavelength of that is
21 centimeters.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.078
There's a standard fingerprint
of hydrogen anywhere in the

00:14:29.078 --> 00:14:29.658
universe.
 

00:14:29.658 --> 00:14:33.504
Sometimes, if the wavelength is
not 21 but 22,

00:14:33.504 --> 00:14:36.409
you can say,
"Why is it 22?

00:14:36.409 --> 00:14:38.120
The wavelength is longer.
 

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:38.919
Maybe it's not hydrogen.
 

00:14:38.919 --> 00:14:40.980
Maybe it's somebody else."
 

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.408
But the answer is that it is
hydrogen, but that galaxy is

00:14:44.408 --> 00:14:47.408
moving away from you,
so that its light is Doppler

00:14:47.408 --> 00:14:48.940
shifted into the red.
 

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.960
If something was coming towards
you, it would be blue shifted.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.399
So you can tell,
if you believe that hydrogen

00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:57.668
atoms all over the universe are
the same hydrogen atoms,

00:14:57.668 --> 00:15:00.789
and the frequency shift is only
due to the motion of the galaxy,

00:15:00.789 --> 00:15:01.960
you find two things.
 

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:07.000
First, what is it made of and
secondly, what's the speed of

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.129
the galaxy?
 

00:15:08.129 --> 00:15:11.144
So the red shift is what one
uses to find the whole story

00:15:11.144 --> 00:15:12.059
about galaxies.
 

00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:12.710
Yes?
 

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:17.485
Student: In the context
of a photon, or an atom being

00:15:17.485 --> 00:15:22.100
___________ by a photon,
what does the L correspond to?

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.000
Prof: What is L
for an atom, right?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.600
That's your question.
 

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.590
Now, this is a fake atom.
 

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.184
This fake atom is an electron
moving on a ring,

00:15:32.184 --> 00:15:32.750
correct?
 

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.610
That L is actually the
size of that ring.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:38.570
You can go to a lab and you can
make a ring of certain micron,

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.558
then the mass of the electron
is known.

00:15:40.558 --> 00:15:42.158
That L would be the
length of the ring.

00:15:42.158 --> 00:15:45.936
For an atom,
what you have to do is that you

00:15:45.936 --> 00:15:48.922
must solve it,
solve this equation,

00:15:48.922 --> 00:15:51.470
where V(x) = what?
 

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.960
In three dimensions,
it will be the charge of the

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.182
nucleus,
which is Z times e,

00:15:57.182 --> 00:15:59.895
charge of the electron,
and it's attractive

00:15:59.895 --> 00:16:02.590
4Πε
_0r,

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:05.570
which is the separation between
them.

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:07.543
So you'll have to solve a
similar equation,

00:16:07.543 --> 00:16:10.269
but that equation will have
d/dx and d/dy and

00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:11.820
d/dz and so on,
right?

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.269
It's in three dimensions.
 

00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:17.750
But this V(r) will
determine the allowed functions

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.190
in that problem.
 

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.335
That won't be an L,
but a certain size will emerge

00:16:22.335 --> 00:16:23.740
even from that problem.
 

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.038
That size will be the size of
the orbit.

00:16:26.038 --> 00:16:28.830
For example,
if you look at the function,

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:32.729
the lowest energy state will
look like e to the

00:16:32.729 --> 00:16:36.038
-r/a_0 times
some number,

00:16:36.038 --> 00:16:38.149
where a_0 is
called the Bohr radius.

00:16:38.149 --> 00:16:41.658
That will be roughly 10^(-8)
centimeters.

00:16:41.658 --> 00:16:44.307
That a_0 will
be a length--you can say where

00:16:44.307 --> 00:16:46.470
is the length and the height of
an atom, right?

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:47.759
It's no box.
 

00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:53.980
The length is the length made
out of eℏm.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.529
You can make a length out of
those things.

00:16:55.529 --> 00:16:57.850
That's what will come out.
 

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.104
So if you want,
you can take any textbook that

00:17:00.104 --> 00:17:02.710
gives you the formula for
hydrogen's Bohr radius,

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:04.740
that's supposedly the radius of
the orbit,

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.817
and you will find its length
a_0 made out of

00:17:07.817 --> 00:17:10.657
the parameters in the problem,
which is the charge of the

00:17:10.657 --> 00:17:13.635
nucleus,
the charge of the electron,

00:17:13.635 --> 00:17:16.078
the mass of the electron.
 

00:17:16.078 --> 00:17:18.163
Okay, so this is,
if you want,

00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:20.964
a simple atom that we have
manufactured,

00:17:20.964 --> 00:17:24.269
because we can see quantization
of energy.

00:17:24.269 --> 00:17:26.190
Yes?
 

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.930
Student: When you go to
the potential of 0,

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:32.940
is it possible to measure both
momentum and position,

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:36.538
in that if you measure the
energy and a position,

00:17:36.538 --> 00:17:40.759
don't you know something about
the momentum?

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:43.919
Prof: But you cannot
measure energy and position at

00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:47.333
the same time either,
because energy--what you can

00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:51.500
really measure at the same time
is energy and momentum.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:55.029
If you can measure p,
you can measure p^(2),

00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:57.880
or p^(3) or any function
of p.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.368
Because knowing a state of well
defined momentum,

00:18:00.368 --> 00:18:04.423
in this problem,
doesn't do anything to the

00:18:04.423 --> 00:18:06.444
energy,
because once you know that

00:18:06.444 --> 00:18:09.470
momentum is p,
p^(2)/2m is the energy.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:12.009
So it turns out,
this is a fortunate case where

00:18:12.009 --> 00:18:14.184
the two variables,
energy and momentum,

00:18:14.184 --> 00:18:16.979
are simply related to each
other in the fact that one is

00:18:16.979 --> 00:18:18.960
essentially the square of the
other.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.330
But if you have two variables,
one involving x and

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.867
p,
at the same time,

00:18:22.867 --> 00:18:26.134
then you cannot measure them
simultaneously with either

00:18:26.134 --> 00:18:27.890
x or with p.
 

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:28.650
Yes?
 

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:32.269
Student: What is
a_0 again?

00:18:32.269 --> 00:18:34.130
Prof:
a_0.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:34.700
Gee, I don't know.
 

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.180
The Bohr radius.
 

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.258
I think it's ℏ squared
over me squared,

00:18:39.258 --> 00:18:40.828
but you have to check.
 

00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:45.251
I don't guarantee that answer,
but I think it's something like

00:18:45.251 --> 00:18:45.759
that.
 

00:18:45.759 --> 00:18:51.720
You can see if it's got at
least units of length.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.910
I'm too lazy to try that.
 

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.910
I think it's something like
this.

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.838
Anyway, suppose it is something
like this.

00:18:58.838 --> 00:19:01.853
My main point is,
it is a length made out of

00:19:01.853 --> 00:19:05.076
Planck's constant,
the mass of the electron and

00:19:05.076 --> 00:19:06.759
the electric charge.
 

00:19:06.759 --> 00:19:10.602
Together they make a length,
and that's the length that

00:19:10.602 --> 00:19:12.950
controls the size of the orbit.
 

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:16.180
All right, so this was the
simpler problem.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:20.365
Now I want to take a more
complicated problem of what I

00:19:20.365 --> 00:19:22.460
call a particle in a box.
 

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.730
So that is a potential.
 

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:27.892
See, normally,
if you make a hole in the

00:19:27.892 --> 00:19:30.531
ground,
it may take this shape,

00:19:30.531 --> 00:19:33.950
and this is the location and
this is the height,

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:37.548
but the height is just the
potential energy directly,

00:19:37.548 --> 00:19:39.980
because it's mg times the
height.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.828
So imagine a particle somewhere
here.

00:19:42.828 --> 00:19:46.559
In classical mechanics--by the
way, the rule for doing quantum

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:48.577
mechanics is,
in classical theory,

00:19:48.577 --> 00:19:51.819
what's the potential
experienced by the particle?

00:19:51.819 --> 00:19:52.970
That's what you ask.
 

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:55.717
And it is that potential that
enters this crazy

00:19:55.717 --> 00:19:57.390
Schrödinger equation.
 

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.836
So you need to know classical
mechanics before you can do

00:19:59.836 --> 00:20:00.710
quantum mechanics.
 

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.211
You should know what potential
the particle experiences in

00:20:03.211 --> 00:20:05.450
classical theory,
and stick that into this

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:08.680
equation to find the allowed
energies in quantum theory.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.996
So if it's a vibrating system,
there is some omega for

00:20:11.996 --> 00:20:12.808
vibrations.
 

00:20:12.808 --> 00:20:14.646
That ω
is √k/m,

00:20:14.646 --> 00:20:16.930
and you can get k from
that one.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:19.845
Or if it's a system like an
atom, where there's an electric

00:20:19.845 --> 00:20:22.258
charge between them,
electric force between them,

00:20:22.258 --> 00:20:24.420
you should know the electric
potential.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.426
So you should know the
potential in classical

00:20:26.426 --> 00:20:29.118
mechanics, and then you do the
quantum theory from there.

00:20:29.118 --> 00:20:32.099
So imagine a particle in this
potential in classical theory,

00:20:32.099 --> 00:20:34.473
and you ask yourself,
what does it do in quantum

00:20:34.473 --> 00:20:35.029
theory?
 

00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:39.880
Well, classical theory says,
let's plot the energy of the

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.440
particle, right?
 

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.013
It's some number that's not
supposed to change as the

00:20:46.013 --> 00:20:47.509
particle moves.
 

00:20:47.509 --> 00:20:51.003
That means here,
if the energy is kinetic

00:20:51.003 --> 00:20:55.808
potential, here the potential is
0, it's all kinetic.

00:20:55.808 --> 00:21:00.150
But as you start going near the
edge, there are two parts here.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:04.509
That's the potential and that's
the kinetic.

00:21:04.509 --> 00:21:09.128
And right here,
all the energy is potential,

00:21:09.128 --> 00:21:12.028
and E = potential.
 

00:21:12.028 --> 00:21:15.098
There is no K. What does
that mean?

00:21:15.098 --> 00:21:19.348
That means the particle comes
here, slows down,

00:21:19.348 --> 00:21:22.490
comes to a rest,
then goes back.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:26.584
It can never be found here if
it had this energy,

00:21:26.584 --> 00:21:29.568
because it's got more--let's
see.

00:21:29.568 --> 00:21:32.788
It's got more potential energy
than total energy.

00:21:32.788 --> 00:21:34.430
That means it's got negative
kinetic energy.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:36.068
That's not possible.
 

00:21:36.068 --> 00:21:39.327
So every classical particle
will execute bounded

00:21:39.327 --> 00:21:43.071
oscillations at any energy,
between what are called the

00:21:43.071 --> 00:21:44.390
turning points.
 

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:48.673
The left turning point and the
right turning point is as far as

00:21:48.673 --> 00:21:50.608
you can go at that energy.
 

00:21:50.608 --> 00:21:52.778
If you've got more energy,
of course you can go further

00:21:52.778 --> 00:21:54.605
out,
and if you've got even more

00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:57.583
energy,
you can just roll up to the top

00:21:57.583 --> 00:21:59.490
of the hill and escape.
 

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:01.480
That's classical mechanics.
 

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.011
Now we want to ask ourselves,
in quantum mechanics,

00:22:05.011 --> 00:22:06.990
what does the particle do?
 

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:10.788
That's our goal.
 

00:22:10.788 --> 00:22:14.076
So I'm going to take a
following simpler problem,

00:22:14.076 --> 00:22:16.608
because it's mathematically
easier.

00:22:16.608 --> 00:22:20.618
I'm going to take a potential
that looks like this.

00:22:20.618 --> 00:22:26.318
It is V_0 to
the right of L.

00:22:26.318 --> 00:22:29.737
It's V_0 to
the left of the origin,

00:22:29.737 --> 00:22:31.009
and it is 0 here.
 

00:22:31.009 --> 00:22:34.440
It's got very sharp walls,
because that makes it easy to

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.750
solve the equation.
 

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.640
In real life,
potentials are rounded off.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:43.568
My fake potential has got sharp
corners.

00:22:43.568 --> 00:22:46.673
I want to take a particle of
some energy and ask,

00:22:46.673 --> 00:22:49.779
what are the allowed energies
in this problem?

00:22:49.779 --> 00:22:51.920
What do the corresponding
functions look like?

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.740
That's what we're asking.
 

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:58.996
So the rule is to go back to
that equation,

00:22:58.996 --> 00:23:03.880
which now takes the following
form: d^(2)ψ/dx^(2).

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.940
I'm going to stop writing the
subscript e.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.813
From now on,
you should understand,

00:23:07.813 --> 00:23:10.900
I'm trying to find states of
definite energy E.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:21.558
2m times E - V ψ
= 0.

00:23:21.558 --> 00:23:25.635
I've just rearranged the
Schrödinger equation,

00:23:25.635 --> 00:23:30.609
so that it looks like second
derivative all kinds of stuff.

00:23:30.609 --> 00:23:33.910
So how do we solve this problem?
 

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:37.244
Well, V varies with
position, so there are three

00:23:37.244 --> 00:23:38.788
regions in the problem.
 

00:23:38.788 --> 00:23:42.319
There's region I inside the
well.

00:23:42.319 --> 00:23:45.150
Inside this well, V is 0.
 

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:49.740
Outside this well in region II,
it = V_0,

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.029
some constant.
 

00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:54.143
Likewise in region III to the
right of the well,

00:23:54.143 --> 00:23:56.328
it's also V_0.
 

00:23:56.328 --> 00:24:02.500
So we've got to solve this
equation in 3 different regions,

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.160
middle, left and right.
 

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.460
First let's solve it in the
middle because it's very easy.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.049
What is the middle defined as?
 

00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:18.519
Middle, region I, V = 0.
 

00:24:18.519 --> 00:24:27.904
So the equation is
d^(2)ψ/dx^(2) 2mE/â„ ^(2)

00:24:27.904 --> 00:24:29.970
is 0.
 

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:36.864
So let me write it as
d^(2)ψ/dx^(2) k^(2)ψ

00:24:36.864 --> 00:24:38.190
= 0.
 

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:43.450
Just like before.
 

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:51.782
This k is the same as
before, k =

00:24:51.782 --> 00:24:58.529
√2mE/â„ ,
in region I.

00:24:58.529 --> 00:25:00.220
So what's the answer to that
one?

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:05.040
Again, it's exponentials,
but I'm purposely going to

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:10.336
write it in region 1 as follows:
as Acoskx 

00:25:10.336 --> 00:25:12.700
Bsinkx.
 

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.210
I hope you all know that this
has exponentials,

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.308
our old friends the
trigonometric functions,

00:25:18.308 --> 00:25:21.230
are also the solution to this
equation,

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:25.518
because the second derivative
of cosine is roughly - the

00:25:25.518 --> 00:25:26.220
cosine.
 

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.144
The second derivative of sine
will also give you

00:25:28.144 --> 00:25:29.660
−k^(2) times the
sine.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.164
So rather than using
exponentials,

00:25:32.164 --> 00:25:35.961
I'm going to use sine and
cosine, because I have an

00:25:35.961 --> 00:25:37.480
ultimate motive.
 

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.594
You realize that exponentials
and sines and cosines are all

00:25:41.594 --> 00:25:44.288
connected by Euler's great
formula,

00:25:44.288 --> 00:25:46.679
so if I want,
I can take e^(ikx) and

00:25:46.679 --> 00:25:48.500
write it as cos i sine.
 

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.061
e^(-ikx),
write that as cos - i

00:25:51.061 --> 00:25:51.470
sine.
 

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.670
Combine the cosines,
and call the coefficient

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:54.220
A.
 

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.438
Combine the coefficients for
sine and call it B,

00:25:56.438 --> 00:25:57.259
and get this form.
 

00:25:57.259 --> 00:25:59.118
There are two alternative ways.
 

00:25:59.118 --> 00:26:02.740
You just write this,
you will see why I picked that.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.319
That's the answer in region I.
 

00:26:04.319 --> 00:26:05.920
We're all set.
 

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.680
Right now, A is
arbitrary, B is arbitrary

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.630
and k is arbitrary.
 

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.420
There is no restriction at all
on any of them.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.740
Do you understand that?
 

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.357
Because if you take this
function, it satisfies that

00:26:18.357 --> 00:26:19.920
equation absolutely.
 

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:27.794
So the free parameters are
A, B and k,

00:26:27.794 --> 00:26:30.509
are all arbitrary.
 

00:26:30.509 --> 00:26:32.980
That means it can have any
k.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:37.150
But the energy is
ℏ^(2)k^(2)/2m,

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:40.068
so it can have any energy.
 

00:26:40.068 --> 00:26:42.599
But we're not done yet,
because we only looked at

00:26:42.599 --> 00:26:43.180
region I.
 

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.291
Have to look at region II and
region III, and then you will

00:26:46.291 --> 00:26:47.578
find out what happens.
 

00:26:47.578 --> 00:26:51.750
So let's go to region II So in
region II,

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.779
the equation obeyed by the
ψ,

00:26:54.779 --> 00:27:08.163
is ψ (let me call it region
II) over dx squared =

00:27:08.163 --> 00:27:21.318
-2m/â„ ^(2) times
V_0 - E ψ.

00:27:21.318 --> 00:27:24.430
I just put it on the other side
now.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:25.710
Now this is all a constant.
 

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:28.487
That's why we picked the
potential, which is piecewise

00:27:28.487 --> 00:27:30.269
constant, so it's some constant.
 

00:27:30.269 --> 00:27:32.573
You're asking yourself,
what ψ has the property

00:27:32.573 --> 00:27:35.429
that when I take 2 derivatives,
it looks like this number times

00:27:35.429 --> 00:27:35.890
ψ?
 

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:42.960
So let me call this whole
combination kappa squared.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:48.652
Then the answer is ψ
of 2 = C times

00:27:48.652 --> 00:27:55.990
e^(κx) D
times e^(-κx).

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.470
Why?
 

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:59.896
Because two derivatives of this
guy will give me kappa squared

00:27:59.896 --> 00:28:02.298
times itself;
likewise here.

00:28:02.298 --> 00:28:14.707
And kappa has been cooked up so
that kappa squared is what I

00:28:14.707 --> 00:28:16.180
want.
 

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:23.176
Yes, now so κ
= 2m/â„ ^(2) times

00:28:23.176 --> 00:28:29.220
V_0 - E under
root.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:33.547
So these are now real
exponentials and not imaginary

00:28:33.547 --> 00:28:34.818
exponentials.
 

00:28:34.818 --> 00:28:38.042
The reason that used to be
sines and cosines,

00:28:38.042 --> 00:28:41.705
or imaginary exponentials,
is that inside the well,

00:28:41.705 --> 00:28:44.490
E - V is a positive
number.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:47.420
Outside the well,
I'm assuming that E - V

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.259
is a negative number.
 

00:28:49.259 --> 00:28:52.420
In other words,
I'm going to consider the well

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:55.019
to be, in the end,
infinitely deep.

00:28:55.019 --> 00:28:58.575
And the energy of the particle,
whatever it is,

00:28:58.575 --> 00:29:00.430
is some finite number.
 

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:02.730
I want to send the walls to
infinity.

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:04.858
That's called particle in a box.
 

00:29:04.858 --> 00:29:07.381
So I'm taking
V_0 finite but

00:29:07.381 --> 00:29:08.470
very, very large.
 

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:10.846
Then it's very clear that
V_0 - E is a

00:29:10.846 --> 00:29:11.640
positive number.
 

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.269
This kappa is what I have here.
 

00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:16.788
Now look at these two functions.
 

00:29:16.788 --> 00:29:21.228
This function grows
exponentially as you go to the

00:29:21.228 --> 00:29:23.130
right, to infinity.
 

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:26.596
That means the wave function
describes a particle that would

00:29:26.596 --> 00:29:29.710
rather be at infinity than
anywhere near this well.

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:32.200
So it's not the problem we're
describing where the particle we

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.670
expect is somewhere near the
well.

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:36.007
Furthermore,
the square of ψ

00:29:36.007 --> 00:29:39.240
can never be normalized to 1,
because an exponentially

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.872
growing function,
the area under that is

00:29:40.872 --> 00:29:41.809
exponentially large.
 

00:29:41.809 --> 00:29:44.130
There's no way to fix that.
 

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:47.518
So on physical grounds,
we drop the solution,

00:29:47.518 --> 00:29:51.828
because we don't have to pick
C to be non-zero.

00:29:51.828 --> 00:29:53.969
We have the freedom,
and the physical condition

00:29:53.969 --> 00:29:56.618
tells you, no one wants a
function growing at infinity.

00:29:56.618 --> 00:29:58.380
We want functions falling at
infinity.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:01.838
This is the only function that
falls at infinity.

00:30:01.838 --> 00:30:04.769
And how does it fall at
infinity, how does it fall off?

00:30:04.769 --> 00:30:10.602
It looks like e to the
-√2m/â„ ^(2) times

00:30:10.602 --> 00:30:13.130
V_0(x).
 

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:17.858
I'm ignoring e compared to this
very large V_0.

00:30:17.858 --> 00:30:20.730
I'm taking V_0
much, much bigger than any

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:21.940
energy I'm looking at.
 

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:25.218
So it's falling exponentially,
and the number on top is like

00:30:25.218 --> 00:30:27.328
square root of
V_0.

00:30:27.328 --> 00:30:29.530
So what do you think happens if
V_0 becomes

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:30.240
very, very large?
 

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:34.488
Well, if you plot the function
that's exponentially falling,

00:30:34.488 --> 00:30:36.000
it falls like that.
 

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.703
But as you increase
V_0,

00:30:39.703 --> 00:30:42.759
it falls more and more quickly.
 

00:30:42.759 --> 00:30:46.108
You follow that?
 

00:30:46.108 --> 00:30:48.336
And eventually,
even V_0 goes

00:30:48.336 --> 00:30:50.154
to infinity;
it just doesn't have a life

00:30:50.154 --> 00:30:50.529
outside.
 

00:30:50.529 --> 00:30:53.108
It just vanishes immediately.
 

00:30:53.108 --> 00:30:55.740
Whatever you start with goes to
0 immediately.

00:30:55.740 --> 00:31:03.236
That basically means
ψ_II(x) is

00:31:03.236 --> 00:31:10.878
just 0 in region III,
if V_0 goes to

00:31:10.878 --> 00:31:12.789
infinity.
 

00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:25.278
 
 

00:31:25.278 --> 00:31:28.308
So let me emphasize what we are
doing here.

00:31:28.308 --> 00:31:32.901
We have a particle in some kind
of well, which is very,

00:31:32.901 --> 00:31:37.577
very tall, not yet infinite,
and you give it some energy

00:31:37.577 --> 00:31:40.298
E that cannot change.
 

00:31:40.298 --> 00:31:43.397
In this region,
in classical mechanics,

00:31:43.397 --> 00:31:46.577
that would be the entire
kinetic energy,

00:31:46.577 --> 00:31:49.349
because potential energy is 0.
 

00:31:49.349 --> 00:31:52.029
What about here?
 

00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:54.838
This is the total energy
available to you.

00:31:54.838 --> 00:31:57.583
Potential energy is all of
that, so kinetic energy has to

00:31:57.583 --> 00:31:58.710
be minus some number.
 

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:01.500
That can never be.
 

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:07.259
That means that particle will
never be found in the region

00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:09.279
outside this well.
 

00:32:09.279 --> 00:32:10.680
Do you understand?
 

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:14.525
As long as the energy is less
than it takes to go to the top

00:32:14.525 --> 00:32:18.306
of the barrier and climb out,
a classical particle--imagine

00:32:18.306 --> 00:32:19.608
rounding it off.
 

00:32:19.608 --> 00:32:21.068
You can come rolling with any
energy.

00:32:21.068 --> 00:32:24.173
If you don't have enough energy
to go over the top,

00:32:24.173 --> 00:32:26.470
you cannot be found in this
region.

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:30.258
But in quantum theory,
as long as the well is not

00:32:30.258 --> 00:32:33.968
infinitely large,
there's an exponentially small

00:32:33.968 --> 00:32:36.098
decaying wave function.
 

00:32:36.098 --> 00:32:39.635
So a classical particle will
turn around at the classical

00:32:39.635 --> 00:32:40.710
turning points.
 

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:44.501
A quantum particle will go
slightly outside the forbidden

00:32:44.501 --> 00:32:48.430
region, into the forbidden
region in both directions of the

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:49.038
well.
 

00:32:49.038 --> 00:32:51.890
That is a purely quantum
phenomenon.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:55.019
It is forbidden,
meaning it's discouraged from

00:32:55.019 --> 00:32:58.430
going there, but it's not
absolutely forbidden.

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:01.019
That's called going over
the--well,

00:33:01.019 --> 00:33:02.960
it's going into the classical
forbidden region,

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.640
but as the barrier gets higher
and higher,

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.874
the excursion into the
forbidden region becomes less

00:33:07.874 --> 00:33:10.817
and less,
because the function falls very

00:33:10.817 --> 00:33:11.519
rapidly.
 

00:33:11.519 --> 00:33:13.839
And I'm considering,
for simplicity,

00:33:13.839 --> 00:33:17.751
a barrier which is infinitely
tall, in which case it doesn't

00:33:17.751 --> 00:33:20.670
go there at all,
even in quantum theory.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:24.833
Therefore, by a similar
argument, ψ

00:33:24.833 --> 00:33:28.450
is 0 here and ψ
is 0 here,

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:31.888
and in region I,
I've shown you,

00:33:31.888 --> 00:33:37.769
ψ = Acoskx
Bsinkx,

00:33:37.769 --> 00:33:42.826
where the energy is related to
k by

00:33:42.826 --> 00:33:45.910
ℏ^(2)k^(2)/2m.
 

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:49.297
So first when we did only
region I, you get the impression

00:33:49.297 --> 00:33:52.744
that A and B and
k can be whatever you

00:33:52.744 --> 00:33:53.279
like.
 

00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:55.868
But now we have an extra
restriction.

00:33:55.868 --> 00:34:01.180
The restriction is that if you
draw the function in this well,

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.520
it can do whatever it wants,
but it must vanish at the two

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.123
ends,
because it's 0 here and it's 0

00:34:07.123 --> 00:34:07.548
here.
 

00:34:07.548 --> 00:34:11.925
Just by continuity of ψ,
every ψ that's allowed must

00:34:11.925 --> 00:34:13.780
vanish at the two ends.
 

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:17.648
That's a new restriction,
because the function that I

00:34:17.648 --> 00:34:21.518
have here in general will not
vanish at the two ends,

00:34:21.518 --> 00:34:24.719
but I'm going to demand that it
vanish.

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:27.358
That will tell me something
about the allowed values of

00:34:27.358 --> 00:34:29.019
A, B and k.
 

00:34:29.019 --> 00:34:30.510
You will see what it is.
 

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:34.688
First I demand that ψ
should vanish on the left end

00:34:34.688 --> 00:34:38.480
of the wall, which is the wall
at x = 0.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.429
This is the wall at x =
L.

00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:43.389
ψ of 0 should be 0.
 

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:45.570
I take the function I have.
 

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:47.556
When this is 0,
x is 0,

00:34:47.556 --> 00:34:48.860
that guy is gone.
 

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:54.659
I get A times cosine 0
which is just A.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:56.429
But that has to vanish.
 

00:34:56.429 --> 00:34:58.829
That means the coefficient
A has to vanish.

00:34:58.829 --> 00:35:01.429
It is not allowed.
 

00:35:01.429 --> 00:35:04.197
So even though it looked like,
before we went to the other

00:35:04.197 --> 00:35:06.820
regions, you can have any
A and any B.

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.449
If you're only in the middle
region, that's correct.

00:35:08.449 --> 00:35:12.115
But if you want to connect your
answer in the middle region to a

00:35:12.115 --> 00:35:15.057
0 on either side,
then the coefficient has to be

00:35:15.057 --> 00:35:18.023
such that the ψ
you have in the middle vanishes

00:35:18.023 --> 00:35:19.150
at the left end.
 

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:21.230
So A is gone.
 

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:24.818
So I'm now left with only the
following thing:

00:35:24.818 --> 00:35:28.090
ψ(x) =
Bsinkx.

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:32.621
We did not have to kill
B because that x =

00:35:32.621 --> 00:35:35.590
0 sine vanished,
so it is allowed.

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:40.679
But now I demand furthermore it
should vanish at x = L.

00:35:40.679 --> 00:35:44.090
Well, at x = L,
what do I find?

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:50.070
I want 0 to =
BsinkL.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.349
That should be 0.
 

00:35:52.349 --> 00:35:55.277
Now one simple way to get there
is to kill B, say

00:35:55.277 --> 00:35:57.550
B = 0, but then you've got
no solution.

00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:59.150
You killed A and you
killed B.

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:02.295
It's certainly true that ψ
= 0 is the solution to this

00:36:02.295 --> 00:36:04.780
equation, but it doesn't
describe anything.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:09.224
So you don't want to kill
B, so you want to blame

00:36:09.224 --> 00:36:11.728
the 0 on the sine,
and the sine,

00:36:11.728 --> 00:36:14.960
as you know,
vanishes for any multiple of

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:15.849
Π.
 

00:36:15.849 --> 00:36:19.239
You can have 0 times Π,
2Π, 3Π,

00:36:19.239 --> 00:36:20.630
4Π, -6Π.
 

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:23.780
They all give you 0 for sine.
 

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:28.719
Therefore k is quantized to be
one of these numbers.

00:36:28.719 --> 00:36:32.760
Therefore k has got only values
nΠ/L.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.199
I'm going to call it
k_n.

00:36:35.199 --> 00:36:38.809
And the energy,
which is really

00:36:38.809 --> 00:36:43.139
ℏ^(2)k^(2)/2m L
squared--

00:36:43.139 --> 00:36:52.931
sorry, k^(2)/2m, becomes
now â„ ^(2)Π^(2)/2m

00:36:52.931 --> 00:37:03.949
L^(2) times n^(2).
And ψ looks like B--

00:37:03.949 --> 00:37:13.143
ψ's of n looks like
Bsin(nΠx/L).

00:37:13.143 --> 00:37:16.260
You guys see that?
 

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.619
These are the allowed function.
 

00:37:18.619 --> 00:37:21.050
The sine function is very nice.
 

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:24.554
It vanishes on the left end,
because when x is 0,

00:37:24.554 --> 00:37:25.320
it's gone.
 

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.106
When x=L,
the argument of the sine is a

00:37:28.106 --> 00:37:30.090
multiple of Π,
it vanishes.

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:33.550
So it looks like this when
n = 1.

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:37.018
It looks like that when
n=2, and so on.

00:37:37.018 --> 00:37:41.429
So it's got more and more
wiggles in the region in

00:37:41.429 --> 00:37:47.010
between, but they are designed
so that they vanish precisely at

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:48.268
the edges.
 

00:37:48.268 --> 00:37:51.809
So it's like it's exactly the
case of a violin string that's

00:37:51.809 --> 00:37:54.461
clamped to two ends,
which has to vanish at the two

00:37:54.461 --> 00:37:56.184
ends,
because you don't let it move

00:37:56.184 --> 00:37:56.530
there.
 

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.849
In between, it can do this and
it can do that.

00:37:58.849 --> 00:38:04.219
It can have more and more
wiggles.

00:38:04.219 --> 00:38:07.543
So what you find is,
of the three things that we

00:38:07.543 --> 00:38:10.373
thought were arbitrary,
A is gone,

00:38:10.373 --> 00:38:12.780
and k is not arbitrary.
 

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:17.625
k is again quantized to
be nΠ/L,

00:38:17.625 --> 00:38:22.773
so that the function does
n half oscillations

00:38:22.773 --> 00:38:26.610
between one end and the other
end.

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:28.775
And therefore there's a
corresponding quantization of

00:38:28.775 --> 00:38:29.150
energy.
 

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.960
Yes?
 

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:30.960
Student: What does that
tell you?

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.489
If you square
ψ_n,

00:38:32.489 --> 00:38:35.253
does that give the probability
of finding it in each one,

00:38:35.253 --> 00:38:36.340
the energy levels?
 

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:36.760
Prof: No.
 

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.309
Let's talk about that now.
 

00:38:38.309 --> 00:38:40.980
So let's write down the
function.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:43.659
The ψ sub energy that we
were looking for,

00:38:43.659 --> 00:38:46.994
we have finally found out,
so let's have a picture in our

00:38:46.994 --> 00:38:47.530
mind.
 

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:48.510
Here is the well.
 

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:50.900
It's going all the way to
infinity.

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:56.724
There is the state n=1,
and the function looks like

00:38:56.724 --> 00:38:57.440
this.
 

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:02.110
Then there is the state--let me
draw it right there,

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:06.050
it looks like that,
n=2 and so on.

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:12.403
In the ψ_n (let
me label the energy by n)

00:39:12.403 --> 00:39:18.550
equals some constant B
times sin(nΠx/L).

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:22.510
That means if you want a
particle in the well to have a

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:25.664
definite energy,
the wave function must look

00:39:25.664 --> 00:39:28.380
like one of these sine
functions.

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:30.922
It must look like this or it
must look like that,

00:39:30.922 --> 00:39:32.300
or the higher harmonics.
 

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:36.168
They are the only allowed
functions for states of definite

00:39:36.168 --> 00:39:36.780
energy.
 

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:40.039
Now before I answer any further
questions,

00:39:40.039 --> 00:39:45.619
the allowed values of n
here you might think are 0,

00:39:45.619 --> 00:39:50.070
or - 1, or - 2 etc.,
but I claim they're just 1,

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:51.550
2,3 and so on.
 

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:55.679
You should think about why.
 

00:39:55.679 --> 00:40:01.320
What's wrong with n=0?
 

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:07.510
Is that a possible value?
 

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:09.851
Can anybody tells me what
happens to this function

00:40:09.851 --> 00:40:10.329
if--yes?
 

00:40:10.329 --> 00:40:11.869
Student: It identically
vanishes

00:40:11.869 --> 00:40:15.077
Prof: If n=0,
the function identically

00:40:15.077 --> 00:40:16.210
vanishes, right?
 

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:19.019
Because sine of 0 times
Πx/L is identical.

00:40:19.019 --> 00:40:19.909
That's not what you want.
 

00:40:19.909 --> 00:40:21.710
You want a nontrivial solution.
 

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:24.719
So we drop this guy.
 

00:40:24.719 --> 00:40:28.500
But how about n=-1?
 

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:35.719
Why don't I keep that?
 

00:40:35.719 --> 00:40:37.010
Yes?
 

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:38.710
Oh, I thought I imagined a hand
going up.

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:39.500
Yes?
 

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:42.829
Student: It's the same
thing as -B sine of the

00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:43.789
positive value.
 

00:40:43.789 --> 00:40:45.429
Prof: That's correct.
 

00:40:45.429 --> 00:40:50.389
If you put n=-1,
the function ψ

00:40:50.389 --> 00:40:55.469
of -1 is B
sin(-Πx/L),

00:40:55.469 --> 00:41:01.800
but that = -1 times B
sin(Πx/L).

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.920
This guy is just
ψ_1.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:09.902
So it's just a multiple of the
ψ_1 function,

00:41:09.902 --> 00:41:14.010
because -1 times the state is
the same state.

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:17.188
You don't get a new function;
you just get a multiple of the

00:41:17.188 --> 00:41:18.947
old function,
and in quantum mechanics,

00:41:18.947 --> 00:41:20.059
they're all the same.
 

00:41:20.059 --> 00:41:20.920
But be very careful.
 

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:25.728
When I did a particle on a
ring, I did e^(ipx/ℏ),

00:41:25.728 --> 00:41:29.947
where I said p =
2Πâ„ /L times any

00:41:29.947 --> 00:41:31.719
integer n.
 

00:41:31.719 --> 00:41:38.929
There I let n = 0, - 1, - 2 etc.
 

00:41:38.929 --> 00:41:41.550
Why did I allow that?
 

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:43.913
First of all,
in that case,

00:41:43.913 --> 00:41:46.639
e to the i times 0 is not 0.
 

00:41:46.639 --> 00:41:49.429
It's in fact constant.
 

00:41:49.429 --> 00:41:53.014
So for a particle going in a
ring, the 0 momentum state is

00:41:53.014 --> 00:41:54.210
actually allowed.
 

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:58.677
And 1 and -1 are not the same,
because e^(ipx) and

00:41:58.677 --> 00:42:01.150
e^(-ipx),
forget the ℏ,

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:04.659
they are not proportional to
each other.

00:42:04.659 --> 00:42:05.960
You understand that?
 

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.650
You can never write
e^(ipx) as a multiple of

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:10.980
e^(-ipx).
 

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:12.360
You see that?
 

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:16.615
If there were such a multiple,
let me call the multiple as

00:42:16.615 --> 00:42:20.425
N, then N is
really e^(2ipx) by

00:42:20.425 --> 00:42:22.739
bringing it the other side.
 

00:42:22.739 --> 00:42:25.989
That's certainly not a constant.
 

00:42:25.989 --> 00:42:29.315
So e^(ipx) can never be
converted to e^(-ipx) by

00:42:29.315 --> 00:42:31.931
multiplying by any number,
so it's an independent

00:42:31.931 --> 00:42:32.639
solution.
 

00:42:32.639 --> 00:42:36.440
On the other hand,
sinx and sin(-x)

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:40.639
are related to each other by a
single factor of -1.

00:42:40.639 --> 00:42:44.751
So that's the reason why in
that case of a particle going in

00:42:44.751 --> 00:42:46.706
a ring,
the solutions are labeled by

00:42:46.706 --> 00:42:48.981
all integers,
positive, negative and 0,

00:42:48.981 --> 00:42:53.300
but a particle in a box,
we label only by positive

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:54.360
integers.
 

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:58.045
Negative integers give you the
same function and 0 kills the

00:42:58.045 --> 00:43:00.170
function, so that's not allowed.
 

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:02.949
Okay, so what about B?
 

00:43:02.949 --> 00:43:05.050
What shall I do with B?
 

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:11.909
What equation's going to
determine B?

00:43:11.909 --> 00:43:13.360
Yes, any idea?
 

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.030
Yes?
 

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:15.869
Student: Normalize right?
 

00:43:15.869 --> 00:43:16.369
Prof: Right.
 

00:43:16.369 --> 00:43:18.516
So first of all,
the equation will never tell

00:43:18.516 --> 00:43:19.639
you what B is.
 

00:43:19.639 --> 00:43:21.710
That's what I want you to
understand.

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:25.802
The equation that I've written
here for the energy functions on

00:43:25.802 --> 00:43:27.710
the top,
if size of B is a

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:30.369
solution, you can multiply both
sides by any number,

00:43:30.369 --> 00:43:32.099
like 15.
 

00:43:32.099 --> 00:43:34.760
Then 15 times ψ
will also be a solution.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:38.141
That's a property of a linear
equation that the answer is not

00:43:38.141 --> 00:43:39.550
given in overall scale.
 

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:41.257
Give me one answer;
I rescale it,

00:43:41.257 --> 00:43:42.659
it's still an answer.
 

00:43:42.659 --> 00:43:45.998
So linear equation will never
tell me the overall size of the

00:43:45.998 --> 00:43:46.610
function.
 

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:55.010
That is picked by the extra
convenient restriction that

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:58.900
ψ^(2)dx = 1.
 

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:04.550
That will determine B
and I'm claiming the answer is

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:10.199
the √(2/L) is what
you want B to be.

00:44:10.199 --> 00:44:11.320
The answer is again simple.
 

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:14.945
The average value of sine
squared over 1 half period is 1

00:44:14.945 --> 00:44:15.400
half.
 

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.099
If you square or integrate or
whatever,

00:44:17.099 --> 00:44:19.480
you'll get L/2,
so B^(2) times

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:23.300
L/2 should be 1,
and B should therefore

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:25.599
be the √(2/L).
 

00:44:25.599 --> 00:44:29.083
So let me write down now the
final result of this problem,

00:44:29.083 --> 00:44:31.650
which I think is very,
very instructive.

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:34.954
If you can follow this much,
you've really got 80 percent of

00:44:34.954 --> 00:44:37.420
the quantum mechanics I want to
teach you.

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:40.329
If you're comfortable with this
example,

00:44:40.329 --> 00:44:43.429
because we're trying to find
out, in quantum theory,

00:44:43.429 --> 00:44:48.260
you've got a particle in a box,
which is like a hole in the

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:50.545
floor,
which is so deep that it's

00:44:50.545 --> 00:44:51.550
infinitely deep.
 

00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:53.233
But even if it's not infinite
but very deep,

00:44:53.233 --> 00:44:54.289
the answer's good enough.
 

00:44:54.289 --> 00:44:56.739
You want to know what it will
do.

00:44:56.739 --> 00:45:00.429
In classical mechanics,
what will it do?

00:45:00.429 --> 00:45:04.978
If you're a particle in a box,
what's your lowest energy

00:45:04.978 --> 00:45:05.639
state?
 

00:45:05.639 --> 00:45:06.429
Yes?
 

00:45:06.429 --> 00:45:07.670
Student: Floor of the
box.

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:10.617
Prof: If you're in
prison with infinitely tall

00:45:10.617 --> 00:45:13.510
walls, you just sit on the floor
and mope, right?

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:15.639
That's the lowest energy state.
 

00:45:15.639 --> 00:45:17.670
But that's not allowed in
quantum mechanics,

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:19.510
because you have a definite
x,

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:21.610
which is wherever you're
sitting, a definite p,

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:22.650
you're not moving.
 

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:25.250
Such a state is not allowed.
 

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:29.322
So in quantum mechanics,
a particle cannot simply sit

00:45:29.322 --> 00:45:29.949
still.
 

00:45:29.949 --> 00:45:34.458
Therefore, it will necessarily
have an uncertainty in position,

00:45:34.458 --> 00:45:37.949
and it will try to spread
itself over the box.

00:45:37.949 --> 00:45:42.210
And the typical uncertainty is
of order.

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:43.559
If I say, "Where is this
particle?"

00:45:43.559 --> 00:45:44.570
I don't know anything.
 

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:46.559
It's got to be somewhere in the
box.

00:45:46.559 --> 00:45:48.610
That's the estimate for
Δx.

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:54.250
So Δp has got to
be bigger than â„ /L.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:56.019
Forget all the 2Π's.
 

00:45:56.019 --> 00:45:57.400
So it cannot have 0 momentum.
 

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.449
It's momentum has to be
fluctuating with that range.

00:46:00.449 --> 00:46:03.231
And the kinetic energy,
which is in fact the total

00:46:03.231 --> 00:46:08.577
energy inside the box,
which is p^(2)/2m,

00:46:08.577 --> 00:46:15.650
the size of that is
ℏ^(2)/2m L^(2).

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:18.539
So that is your estimate for
what should be the energy of a

00:46:18.539 --> 00:46:21.429
particle in a box of size
L. So what happens is,

00:46:21.429 --> 00:46:25.170
the box of size L forces
it to have a spread in momentum,

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:28.186
because you've squeezed it to a
position known to within

00:46:28.186 --> 00:46:28.789
L.
 

00:46:28.789 --> 00:46:31.182
The spread in momentum
translates into spread in

00:46:31.182 --> 00:46:33.344
kinetic energy,
and if I take the spread in

00:46:33.344 --> 00:46:36.021
kinetic energy to be a rough
estimate of the lowest kinetic

00:46:36.021 --> 00:46:39.085
energy I could have,
you get a number which except

00:46:39.085 --> 00:46:42.389
for factors of Π
is in fact the right answer.

00:46:42.389 --> 00:46:46.076
So people always estimate
energies of particles by doing

00:46:46.076 --> 00:46:47.349
this calculation.
 

00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:49.092
For example,
take a nucleus,

00:46:49.092 --> 00:46:51.610
which is 10^(-13) centimeters
across.

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:52.920
I put a proton there.
 

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.849
What's the minimum kinetic
energy of that proton?

00:46:55.849 --> 00:46:58.838
You find by the following
method: Δx is

00:46:58.838 --> 00:47:01.768
10^(-13), because it's somewhere
in the nucleus.

00:47:01.768 --> 00:47:03.858
Δp is that,
and you do that,

00:47:03.858 --> 00:47:05.268
you will get some energy.
 

00:47:05.268 --> 00:47:09.398
That will be the typical energy
of a particle inside the

00:47:09.398 --> 00:47:10.150
nucleus.
 

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:13.130
So particles inside the nucleus
cannot sit still.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:15.320
More you cram them,
it's like children.

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:18.349
You put them in a tighter room,
they're jiggling more and more.

00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:20.760
That's called zero point motion.
 

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:23.302
You cannot just nail them in
x without letting them

00:47:23.302 --> 00:47:24.239
spread in p.
 

00:47:24.239 --> 00:47:27.867
That means you cannot get the
lowest energy So lowest energy

00:47:27.867 --> 00:47:31.739
is some number you can estimate
by the uncertainty principle.

00:47:31.739 --> 00:47:36.251
So the next question was,
let's take one of these

00:47:36.251 --> 00:47:40.577
functions, say ψ's of 3,
the square root of

00:47:40.577 --> 00:47:44.150
(2/L)sin(
3Πx/L).

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:49.295
If you plot that guy,
that function will look like

00:47:49.295 --> 00:47:50.030
this.
 

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:51.789
Now what was your question?
 

00:47:51.789 --> 00:47:55.206
If I measure a particle's
position, what's the

00:47:55.206 --> 00:47:56.268
probability?
 

00:47:56.268 --> 00:47:57.730
You've just got to square this
function.

00:47:57.730 --> 00:47:59.429
It will look like this.
 

00:47:59.429 --> 00:48:03.010
That's the probability.
 

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:04.889
If you measure the energy,
what will you get?

00:48:04.889 --> 00:48:11.230
You will get exactly one energy
corresponding to n=3.

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:14.347
It's in a state of definite
energy, but not definite

00:48:14.347 --> 00:48:15.018
position.
 

00:48:15.018 --> 00:48:18.130
Position has got some ups and
downs.

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:25.699
The probability for x looks
like that.

00:48:25.699 --> 00:48:26.750
So everyone with me?
 

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:30.617
This is like knowing the
spectrum of this artificial

00:48:30.617 --> 00:48:31.150
atom.
 

00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:34.210
In a real atom,
the electron is forced to stay

00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:36.733
near the nucleus,
because the 1 over r

00:48:36.733 --> 00:48:39.101
potential,
if you plot it as a function of

00:48:39.101 --> 00:48:41.409
r,
looks like a well.

00:48:41.409 --> 00:48:44.750
And the particle is somewhere
here.

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:50.771
In this problem,
the particle is confined by the

00:48:50.771 --> 00:48:51.539
box.
 

00:48:51.539 --> 00:48:54.503
Whenever you have a confining
thing that keeps the particle in

00:48:54.503 --> 00:48:56.739
a certain region,
the energy gets quantized.

00:48:56.739 --> 00:49:00.396
And we found out in our first
example the quantized energy

00:49:00.396 --> 00:49:02.449
levels of a particle in a box.
 

00:49:02.449 --> 00:49:05.871
And you can probe the particle
by shining light and the energy

00:49:05.871 --> 00:49:07.610
levels are plotted like this.
 

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:10.769
This is n=1,
this is n=2,

00:49:10.769 --> 00:49:12.599
which is n=3.
 

00:49:12.599 --> 00:49:15.610
Zero is here.
 

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:18.110
The zero state is not allowed.
 

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:20.677
You've got to have n=1
and 4 times that will be

00:49:20.677 --> 00:49:23.099
n=2, and 9 times that
will be n=3.

00:49:23.099 --> 00:49:25.219
Energy grows like n^(2).
 

00:49:25.219 --> 00:49:28.262
And then you can come from
there to there emitting a

00:49:28.262 --> 00:49:29.786
photon,
or you can go from there to

00:49:29.786 --> 00:49:32.199
there emitting a photon,
or you can go from here to here

00:49:32.199 --> 00:49:33.179
absorbing a photon.
 

00:49:33.179 --> 00:49:35.349
You can do all kinds of things.
 

00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:38.119
That's how if you want you can
test quantum mechanics.

00:49:38.119 --> 00:49:41.688
Put a known particle inside the
well and shine light and see

00:49:41.688 --> 00:49:43.139
what light it absorbs.
 

00:49:43.139 --> 00:49:43.860
Yes.
 

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:47.175
Student: So the ψ
of 3, is that the ψ

00:49:47.175 --> 00:49:49.449
of the energy function
_________?

00:49:49.449 --> 00:49:50.949
Prof: Yes.
 

00:49:50.949 --> 00:49:51.829
Exactly right.
 

00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:55.260
So what I should really write,
he's absolutely right,

00:49:55.260 --> 00:50:01.135
I should write E =
â„ ^(2)Π^(2)/2m L

00:50:01.135 --> 00:50:04.929
squared 3 squared,
right?

00:50:04.929 --> 00:50:06.400
The third energy level.
 

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:09.653
So I'm short circuiting all of
that and just calling it

00:50:09.653 --> 00:50:10.860
ψ_3.
 

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:13.954
Normally, if you put a label 3,
it's not clear what we're

00:50:13.954 --> 00:50:14.840
talking about.
 

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.940
Maybe it's the position
x=3.

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:18.880
Maybe it's the momentum
p=3.

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.130
But in this lecture,
since we're talking only about

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:22.940
energy,
I thought I will just call it

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.590
ψ_3,
but at least I should call it

00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:26.768
ψ_E3.
 

00:50:26.768 --> 00:50:33.920
Student:
&gt;

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:35.349
Prof: Yeah,
I just did that.

00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:41.018
Student:
&gt;

00:50:41.018 --> 00:50:43.989
Prof: You can take the
complex conjugate,

00:50:43.989 --> 00:50:46.958
but for a real function,
you can just square it,

00:50:46.958 --> 00:50:47.590
right?
 

00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:49.030
You understand?
 

00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:54.260
If ψ is real,
ψ*is the same as ψ.

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:58.367
So ψ*is also
(2/L)sin(3

00:50:58.367 --> 00:51:00.610
Πx/L).
 

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:02.710
So ψ*ψ is just a square.
 

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:05.969
Student: On the first
board, you have

00:51:05.969 --> 00:51:09.909
A_E = _________
ψ*E ψ

00:51:09.909 --> 00:51:10.820
_______.
 

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:14.800
I'm wondering why there's no
_______________.

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:15.320
Prof: No.
 

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.150
I think I know what the problem
is you're having now.

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:20.900
That formula is not relevant
now.

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:25.719
I'll tell you when that formula
will come into play.

00:51:25.719 --> 00:51:29.110
It will come into play in the
following situation.

00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:34.637
I have a particle in a box
whose wave function looks like

00:51:34.637 --> 00:51:35.329
this.
 

00:51:35.329 --> 00:51:40.230
Somebody put it in that state,
okay?

00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:42.862
It's an allowed wave function
because it vanishes at the ends

00:51:42.862 --> 00:51:43.610
like it should.
 

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:46.219
Beyond that,
it does anything it wants.

00:51:46.219 --> 00:51:50.139
That is my ψ(x),
okay?

00:51:50.139 --> 00:51:52.811
If I measure the energy of that
guy, now you tell me,

00:51:52.811 --> 00:51:56.099
if I measure the energy in that
state, what answer will I get?

00:51:56.099 --> 00:52:00.230
Student:
&gt;

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.960
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:01.440
Yes.
 

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:04.780
I'll get one of those quantized
values, do you understand?

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:08.349
A particle in a box under
energy measurement can give only

00:52:08.349 --> 00:52:09.789
one of those numbers.
 

00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:11.655
Now this guy is not one of
those functions,

00:52:11.655 --> 00:52:12.409
you understand.
 

00:52:12.409 --> 00:52:15.010
This is a randomly chosen
function.

00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:16.869
But when I measure energy,
so what will I do?

00:52:16.869 --> 00:52:18.739
Maybe you can guess now.
 

00:52:18.739 --> 00:52:21.409
Student: Write it as a
sum of energy functions

00:52:21.409 --> 00:52:22.239
Prof: That's correct.
 

00:52:22.239 --> 00:52:28.016
You will have to write this guy
as a sum of A--let me call it n

00:52:28.016 --> 00:52:29.599
for energy now.
 

00:52:29.599 --> 00:52:35.070
A √(2/L)
sin(nΠx/L).

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:38.612
I mean, this is just
A_E ψ's of

00:52:38.612 --> 00:52:40.210
E of x.
 

00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:44.309
Except E is labeled by an
integer, so I'm writing it this

00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.750
way.
 

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:47.420
Then I have to find
A_n.

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:51.148
And if I want to find
A_n,

00:52:51.148 --> 00:52:56.119
that = integral of (2/L)
sin(nΠx/L).

00:52:56.119 --> 00:52:57.927
If you want,
you can put a conjugate,

00:52:57.927 --> 00:53:00.239
but it doesn't matter,
because sine is real.

00:53:00.239 --> 00:53:03.960
Multiply it by Mr. Crazy
here, whatever it is,

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:06.110
and do their integral.
 

00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:09.500
It will give you some number
for every n.

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:10.867
A_1,
A_2,

00:53:10.867 --> 00:53:12.280
A_3,
A_4,

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:15.018
and the square of every one of
them will give you the odds that

00:53:15.018 --> 00:53:17.356
you will find this energy or
that energy or some other

00:53:17.356 --> 00:53:18.018
energy.
 

00:53:18.018 --> 00:53:21.498
So what quantum mechanics tells
you is, an energy measurement of

00:53:21.498 --> 00:53:24.260
a particle in a box cannot give
a random answer.

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:26.389
It can only give one of these
answers.

00:53:26.389 --> 00:53:28.940
That's the quantization of
energy.

00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:32.911
It does not mean every particle
in a box is in a state of

00:53:32.911 --> 00:53:34.190
definite energy.
 

00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:37.014
A particle in a box can be any
wave function,

00:53:37.014 --> 00:53:40.608
provided it vanishes at the
ends and doesn't spill out of

00:53:40.608 --> 00:53:42.469
the infinitely tall wall.
 

00:53:42.469 --> 00:53:44.405
So for every one of them,
you can ask the usual

00:53:44.405 --> 00:53:46.510
questions: what happens when I
measure position?

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:47.750
Square the function.
 

00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:49.268
What happens when I measure
momentum?

00:53:49.268 --> 00:53:51.800
Write it in terms of e
to the ipx functions.

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.309
What happens when I measure
energy?

00:53:53.309 --> 00:53:56.809
Write it in terms of these
functions.

00:53:56.809 --> 00:54:03.579
Okay?
 

00:54:03.579 --> 00:54:07.121
All right, so I want to do one
last topic here,

00:54:07.121 --> 00:54:11.280
which is called scattering,
but I don't want to proceed

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:14.670
till you guys have understood
this part.

00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:17.409
This is covered in all the
books and maybe you can read the

00:54:17.409 --> 00:54:18.969
books or you can read my notes.
 

00:54:18.969 --> 00:54:21.039
You can talk to everybody.
 

00:54:21.039 --> 00:54:24.525
But we have solved--from this,
all quantum problems that we

00:54:24.525 --> 00:54:27.409
all do are exactly isomorphic to
this problem.

00:54:27.409 --> 00:54:30.007
It's the same thing we do over
and over again,

00:54:30.007 --> 00:54:33.010
except the equations you solve
are more difficult.

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:33.929
They can be in higher
dimensions.

00:54:33.929 --> 00:54:37.260
They can involve more than one
particle.

00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:40.110
The potential could be
complicated, but the philosophy

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:41.239
is always the same.
 

00:54:41.239 --> 00:54:43.039
There'll be some
Schrödinger equation,

00:54:43.039 --> 00:54:45.969
and you want to find all the
functions that satisfy it,

00:54:45.969 --> 00:54:49.760
find the allowed energies and
the allowed functions.

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:52.070
We will see that states of
definite energy have a very

00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:53.768
privileged role in quantum
mechanics.

00:54:53.768 --> 00:54:57.639
That will be clear in the next
two lectures.

00:54:57.639 --> 00:55:01.940
But right now,
here's what I want to do.

00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:05.099
This is a very small variation
of what we have done,

00:55:05.099 --> 00:55:07.639
so most of the hard work has
been done.

00:55:07.639 --> 00:55:10.320
I'm just going to cash in on
that.

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:15.574
Take the following problem in
classical mechanics:

00:55:15.574 --> 00:55:18.469
here is the level ground.
 

00:55:18.469 --> 00:55:23.980
Then I make a little change in
the landscape so that this has

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:28.940
got certain height and therefore
certain potential,

00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:31.809
V_0. And from
this end,

00:55:31.809 --> 00:55:35.619
I roll a marble and see what
happens.

00:55:35.619 --> 00:55:40.733
The marble is given some energy
E, which because there is

00:55:40.733 --> 00:55:44.550
no potential here,
it's just p^(2)/2m.

00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:48.599
Question is, what will happen?
 

00:55:48.599 --> 00:55:52.313
Can you tell me what will
happen in this problem,

00:55:52.313 --> 00:55:53.630
to this marble?
 

00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:55.885
Student: Don't we have
to use the Schrödinger

00:55:55.885 --> 00:55:56.369
equations?
 

00:55:56.369 --> 00:55:57.039
Prof: No.
 

00:55:57.039 --> 00:55:57.920
Classical mechanics.
 

00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:00.326
Student: Oh,
the marble will only go up as

00:56:00.326 --> 00:56:03.284
far as it has the amount of
energy that that would equal the

00:56:03.284 --> 00:56:05.039
potential energy at that point.
 

00:56:05.039 --> 00:56:05.550
Prof: That's correct.
 

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:09.170
So he said it will go as far as
energy equals potential,

00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:11.869
so let p^(2)/2m have
this value.

00:56:11.869 --> 00:56:12.809
That's my energy.
 

00:56:12.809 --> 00:56:13.889
And it does not change.
 

00:56:13.889 --> 00:56:15.960
That's the law of conservation
of energy.

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:20.083
So here, since energy is
kinetic potential,

00:56:20.083 --> 00:56:21.949
it's all kinetic.
 

00:56:21.949 --> 00:56:26.880
Somewhere here,
that part of it is potential;

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:28.739
the rest of it is kinetic.
 

00:56:28.739 --> 00:56:31.280
Here kinetic vanishes.
 

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:34.018
Here you're not allowed.
 

00:56:34.018 --> 00:56:37.311
So you will go,
you will climb that far and

00:56:37.311 --> 00:56:38.800
you'll come back.
 

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:45.023
But if your initial energy was
that, then you will come here,

00:56:45.023 --> 00:56:46.889
going very fast.
 

00:56:46.889 --> 00:56:50.798
You will slow down,
but you still make it on the

00:56:50.798 --> 00:56:53.960
other side, but with lower
velocity.

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:55.010
That's very simple.
 

00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:56.320
There's only one answer you can
get.

00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:57.469
You throw something.
 

00:56:57.469 --> 00:56:59.902
If it comes back,
it means the barrier is taller

00:56:59.902 --> 00:57:00.989
than what you have.
 

00:57:00.989 --> 00:57:03.579
Suppose you cannot see this
barrier.

00:57:03.579 --> 00:57:05.914
All you have is a marble,
and you want to know how tall

00:57:05.914 --> 00:57:06.650
the barrier is.
 

00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:07.480
Very easy.
 

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.130
Throw the marble at a known
speed.

00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:12.367
If it comes back,
then you haven't reached the

00:57:12.367 --> 00:57:13.880
top of the barrier.
 

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:17.079
Keep on increasing the kinetic
energy till one day it doesn't

00:57:17.079 --> 00:57:17.719
come back.
 

00:57:17.719 --> 00:57:19.699
That's when you're sitting
right here.

00:57:19.699 --> 00:57:23.072
That's one way to tell how tall
this hill is without actually

00:57:23.072 --> 00:57:23.860
going there.
 

00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:27.684
But now what I want to do is do
a quantum mechanical experiment

00:57:27.684 --> 00:57:29.659
in exactly the same situation.
 

00:57:29.659 --> 00:57:38.362
I want to send a particle from
the left and I want to see what

00:57:38.362 --> 00:57:39.789
happens.
 

00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:43.293
So now, to simplify the
problem, I'm going to take the

00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:45.940
potential to again have only 2
values.

00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:49.922
At x = 0,
it jumps to a value

00:57:49.922 --> 00:57:52.539
V_0.
 

00:57:52.539 --> 00:57:55.838
So this problem is just the
Schrödinger equation in the

00:57:55.838 --> 00:57:59.250
left region, Schrödinger
equation in the right region.

00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:03.255
So I'm going to spare you some
of the calculations,

00:58:03.255 --> 00:58:05.420
because it's so familiar.
 

00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:13.240
One will look like Ae^(ikx)
Be^(-ikx),

00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:21.239
where k^(2) is just
2mE/ℏ^(2),

00:58:21.239 --> 00:58:22.840
here.
 

00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:27.344
First, let's take a case where
E is bigger than

00:58:27.344 --> 00:58:29.809
V_0,
okay?

00:58:29.809 --> 00:58:32.449
Then I go to region II.
 

00:58:32.449 --> 00:58:35.148
Region II I've got to solve the
Schrödinger equation with a

00:58:35.148 --> 00:58:36.389
V_0 in it.
 

00:58:36.389 --> 00:58:41.715
Then you will find in region
II, ψ II looks like

00:58:41.715 --> 00:58:46.309
Ce^(ik'x)
De^(−ik'x),

00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:52.201
where k'^(2) will be
2m times E -

00:58:52.201 --> 00:58:57.010
V_0 over
ℏ^(2).

00:58:57.010 --> 00:58:59.219
Because when you have a
potential, you must always

00:58:59.219 --> 00:59:00.617
have--
look at the Schrödinger

00:59:00.617 --> 00:59:04.378
equation here--
2m/ℏ^(2) at E -

00:59:04.378 --> 00:59:05.199
V.
 

00:59:05.199 --> 00:59:06.550
So E is not 0.
 

00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:09.559
The k' now,
so what does this mean?

00:59:09.559 --> 00:59:13.579
You can see very simply,
it's got some momentum here.

00:59:13.579 --> 00:59:16.496
It's got a smaller momentum
here, because k'^(2) is

00:59:16.496 --> 00:59:18.800
going to be smaller than
k^(2), because

00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.949
V_0 is non-zero
here.

00:59:20.949 --> 00:59:24.813
That is just the statement that
when the particle's moving here,

00:59:24.813 --> 00:59:28.371
it's slower than when it's
here, because it has to climb up

00:59:28.371 --> 00:59:29.170
the hill.
 

00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:34.137
So the wave functions in this
region has got an incoming,

00:59:34.137 --> 00:59:38.130
right moving wave of momentum,
ℏk.

00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:41.730
It's got to reflect that wave
of momentum -ℏk.

00:59:41.730 --> 00:59:45.795
And in this region again,
it's got a right moving and a

00:59:45.795 --> 00:59:50.239
left moving, because this
k can be of either sign.

00:59:50.239 --> 00:59:51.384
So you can pick the
coefficients,

00:59:51.384 --> 00:59:53.242
A,
B, C, D arbitrarily,

00:59:53.242 --> 00:59:55.800
but I'm going to choose
D = 0,

00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:59.929
because what I have in mind is
a problem where the particle

00:59:59.929 --> 01:00:02.280
actually came in from the left.
 

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:05.579
If it came in from the left,
I'm prepared for some of it

01:00:05.579 --> 01:00:08.219
coming back reflected,
and some of it getting

01:00:08.219 --> 01:00:09.179
transmitted.
 

01:00:09.179 --> 01:00:11.371
There's nobody coming in from
the right at infinity,

01:00:11.371 --> 01:00:13.349
because I'm not sending
anything from there.

01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:15.170
I'm sending my particle from
the left.

01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:19.202
So I pick a solution in which
D, which is anything,

01:00:19.202 --> 01:00:20.760
I pick that to be 0.
 

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:24.889
So here are my two solutions.
 

01:00:24.889 --> 01:00:28.771
I hope you understand that
k and k' are not

01:00:28.771 --> 01:00:30.018
the same number.
 

01:00:30.018 --> 01:00:32.425
k' is smaller because
the momentum on the right hand

01:00:32.425 --> 01:00:34.664
side is going to be less,
because some of it's eaten up

01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:35.659
by potential energy.
 

01:00:35.659 --> 01:00:38.469
So what people do is they draw
a picture like this.

01:00:38.469 --> 01:00:41.606
They draw a wave that's going
at some speed,

01:00:41.606 --> 01:00:45.110
and it comes in this region and
it slows down.

01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:47.219
That's what the function will
look like.

01:00:47.219 --> 01:00:48.829
The real function's made of
exponentials,

01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:51.141
but the real and imaginary
parts will have rapid

01:00:51.141 --> 01:00:54.239
oscillations on the left and
slow oscillations on the right,

01:00:54.239 --> 01:00:58.110
because k is bigger than
k'.

01:00:58.110 --> 01:00:58.539
Very good.
 

01:00:58.539 --> 01:01:02.804
So now I have the following
condition: at the interface

01:01:02.804 --> 01:01:07.228
where the two regions meet,
the ψ must match from the

01:01:07.228 --> 01:01:09.440
left and from the right.
 

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:12.335
So x = 0,
coming from the left,

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:16.246
I want ψ_1 at 0
should be the same at

01:01:16.246 --> 01:01:18.360
ψ_2 at 0.
 

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:24.650
That will tell me that A B =
C.

01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:30.166
Because if you put x =
0, all the exponentials become

01:01:30.166 --> 01:01:33.719
one, and A B must =
C.

01:01:33.719 --> 01:01:36.695
There's the condition that if
you come from the two sides,

01:01:36.695 --> 01:01:38.420
the wave function has to match.
 

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:41.894
But in the Schrödinger
theory, you make a second

01:01:41.894 --> 01:01:44.969
requirement that the derivatives
also match.

01:01:44.969 --> 01:01:49.690
The two functions coming from
the left and right cannot join

01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:50.650
like this.
 

01:01:50.650 --> 01:01:53.889
They must join with the same
slope.

01:01:53.889 --> 01:01:57.460
The reason the slope must be
the same is that if the slope

01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:01.159
changed abruptly at one point,
the rate of change of slope

01:02:01.159 --> 01:02:03.942
will be infinite there,
because d^(2)ψ/dx^(2)

01:02:03.942 --> 01:02:05.760
is the rate of change of the
slope.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.320
But in the Schrödinger
equation,

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.909
the second derivative ψ,
if it's infinite,

01:02:09.909 --> 01:02:12.360
there is no compensating terms
in the equation,

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.630
because E and V
are all finite.

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:17.257
So that infinity will not be
balanced, so you can never have

01:02:17.257 --> 01:02:17.570
that.
 

01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:19.010
So second derivative must be
finite;

01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:21.000
first derivative must be
continuous.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.987
So I make the requirement that
dψ/dx in region I at

01:02:26.987 --> 01:02:32.090
x = 0 must match
dψ II dx at

01:02:32.090 --> 01:02:33.760
x = 0.
 

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.679
What does that give me?
 

01:02:35.679 --> 01:02:42.929
Well, take the derivative and
equate them at x = 0,

01:02:42.929 --> 01:02:51.070
you'll find ik times A - B
= ik' times C.

01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:55.442
Take the derivative and then
equate the derivatives at

01:02:55.442 --> 01:02:56.679
x = 0.
 

01:02:56.679 --> 01:02:58.445
Derivatives brings down
ik for this,

01:02:58.445 --> 01:02:59.369
-ik for that.
 

01:02:59.369 --> 01:03:02.570
Blah, blah, you put them
together.

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:05.980
So these are the two conditions.
 

01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:10.487
Now what causes mild panic is
that I have three unknowns and

01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:11.710
two equations.
 

01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:13.807
I've got A,
B and C,

01:03:13.807 --> 01:03:15.969
and I've got only two
equations.

01:03:15.969 --> 01:03:22.079
So what do you think is going
on?

01:03:22.079 --> 01:03:29.320
Anybody have an idea?
 

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.659
It's that even in the particle
in a box,

01:03:31.659 --> 01:03:34.483
you'll remember the overall
height of the wave function is

01:03:34.483 --> 01:03:37.059
never determined by the
Schrödinger equation.

01:03:37.059 --> 01:03:38.219
It's whatever you like.
 

01:03:38.219 --> 01:03:43.119
So what people do is they say,
"Let's pick A =

01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:43.980
1."
 

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:46.369
That sets the overall height
arbitrarily.

01:03:46.369 --> 01:03:54.793
Then I get 1 B = C and
ik times 1 - B =

01:03:54.793 --> 01:03:56.650
ik' [C}.
 

01:03:56.650 --> 01:03:59.931
Now of course you can solve
for B and you can solve

01:03:59.931 --> 01:04:00.739
for C.
 

01:04:00.739 --> 01:04:03.518
I'm not going to do that here;
it's very easy.

01:04:03.518 --> 01:04:11.730
You're going to find B = k
− k' over k k'.

01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:19.349
You're going to find C =
2k over k k'.

01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:22.579
That's simple algebra of
simultaneous equations.

01:04:22.579 --> 01:04:27.119
I want you to look at the
answer.

01:04:27.119 --> 01:04:30.809
You remember now what A,
B and C are.

01:04:30.809 --> 01:04:34.900
A comes in,
B goes back and C

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:36.570
goes to the right.
 

01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:41.940
What do you find strange about
the answer?

01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:47.458
It's that if you came in from
the left with an energy bigger

01:04:47.458 --> 01:04:51.760
than the barrier,
there's a certain probability

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:54.659
that you will go backwards.
 

01:04:54.659 --> 01:04:56.525
In classical mechanics,
if your energy is more than the

01:04:56.525 --> 01:04:57.769
barrier, you will never come
back.

01:04:57.769 --> 01:04:58.639
The probability is 0.
 

01:04:58.639 --> 01:05:00.947
In quantum theory,
even though your energy is more

01:05:00.947 --> 01:05:03.876
than the barrier,
there's a certain probability

01:05:03.876 --> 01:05:08.329
you'll get reflected and certain
probability to get transmitted.

01:05:08.329 --> 01:05:10.880
The square of this is like the
odds of going to the right.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.530
The square of this is like the
odds of getting reflected.

01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:17.411
The point is the reflection
probability does not vanish even

01:05:17.411 --> 01:05:20.699
if the energy is bigger than the
barrier height.

01:05:20.699 --> 01:05:23.710
That's because this is quantum
mechanics and you're really

01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:25.768
dealing with waves and not
particles.

01:05:25.768 --> 01:05:28.940
And waves have the property
that when the medium changes,

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:30.469
there is some reflection.
 

01:05:30.469 --> 01:05:33.849
And to the quantum mechanical
wave ψ,

01:05:33.849 --> 01:05:36.539
a barrier looks like a change
in refractive index,

01:05:36.539 --> 01:05:39.809
so it will get reflected and
some will get transmitted.

01:05:39.809 --> 01:05:42.474
But the interesting thing is,
in the quantum problem,

01:05:42.474 --> 01:05:45.550
you can send your billiard ball
to find how tall the mountain

01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:45.909
is.
 

01:05:45.909 --> 01:05:48.231
And even if the energy was more
than the mountain,

01:05:48.231 --> 01:05:49.559
sometimes it'll come back.
 

01:05:49.559 --> 01:05:53.449
So that's not a reliable way to
measure that.

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:57.154
The last example is,
what if your energy is less

01:05:57.154 --> 01:05:58.099
than this?
 

01:05:58.099 --> 01:06:03.480
What if your energy is like
here, lower than the barrier?

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:07.956
If you're lower than the
barrier, you will find that

01:06:07.956 --> 01:06:12.518
k' will equal i
times some κ,

01:06:12.518 --> 01:06:17.576
because it will become
imaginary, and you will have

01:06:17.576 --> 01:06:21.518
then a function that looks like
this.

01:06:21.518 --> 01:06:24.938
The function will oscillate,
then it will die exponentially

01:06:24.938 --> 01:06:25.940
in this region.
 

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:29.409
It's exactly what I did
earlier, like particle in a box.

01:06:29.409 --> 01:06:34.556
In the classically forbidden
region, it goes a little

01:06:34.556 --> 01:06:37.329
distance but not very far.
 

01:06:37.329 --> 01:06:40.190
So it does get reflected if the
energy is less,

01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:44.108
but you can actually find it in
a region where it's not supposed

01:06:44.108 --> 01:06:44.730
to be.
 

01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:47.951
And you can say that's going to
be very embarrassing for the

01:06:47.951 --> 01:06:50.791
particle to be found here,
because its kinetic energy

01:06:50.791 --> 01:06:52.320
should be negative here.
 

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:55.179
So what's the particle say to
you when you catch it there?

01:06:55.179 --> 01:06:57.510
It will say,
"In order to locate me

01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:59.434
here,
you shine some light on me,

01:06:59.434 --> 01:07:02.485
and the energy I got from the
photon made me legitimate in

01:07:02.485 --> 01:07:03.610
that region."
 

01:07:03.610 --> 01:07:05.510
It will come back to positive
energy.

01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:08.487
So the act of measurement will
prevent it from ever being

01:07:08.487 --> 01:07:11.041
caught in that region,
but it's got an amplitude,

01:07:11.041 --> 01:07:13.010
a probability to be caught
there.

01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:16.010
Final thing I want to mention
is, if this barrier,

01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:20.829
instead of going on forever,
terminated there and became 0

01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:23.570
again,
this will leak out here and

01:07:23.570 --> 01:07:27.530
start going out with the same
wavelength as that one.

01:07:27.530 --> 01:07:30.010
That's called barrier
penetration.

01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:32.635
That means if you send a
particle here with an energy not

01:07:32.635 --> 01:07:35.309
enough to overcome the barrier
in classical mechanics,

01:07:35.309 --> 01:07:38.057
in quantum mechanics,
it's got a small chance of

01:07:38.057 --> 01:07:39.929
being found on the other side.
 

01:07:39.929 --> 01:07:42.070
On the other side,
it can go scot free.

01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:44.983
It's not allowed in this
region, because there the

01:07:44.983 --> 01:07:46.710
kinetic energy is negative.
 

01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:51.391
Here kinetic energy is the same
as before, except the height may

01:07:51.391 --> 01:07:52.579
be very small.
 

01:07:52.579 --> 01:07:56.512
So this means no barrier is
completely safe in quantum

01:07:56.512 --> 01:07:57.179
theory.
 

01:07:57.179 --> 01:08:00.659
So I'm going to give you my
final survival tip.

01:08:00.659 --> 01:08:02.938
I've told you so many
situations you can be in where

01:08:02.938 --> 01:08:04.190
this course will help you.
 

01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:05.730
So here's another one.
 

01:08:05.730 --> 01:08:09.293
You are in a prison and it
doesn't have infinite walls,

01:08:09.293 --> 01:08:11.010
but it's got some walls.
 

01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:12.619
What's your strategy?
 

01:08:12.619 --> 01:08:16.358
I say go ram yourself into that
wall as often as you can,

01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:19.494
because there's a small
probability that you can

01:08:19.494 --> 01:08:22.500
suddenly find yourself on the
other side.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:25.578
This is what happens in alpha
decay.

01:08:25.578 --> 01:08:29.105
In alpha decay,
there's helium nuclei sitting

01:08:29.105 --> 01:08:30.630
inside a nucleus.
 

01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:34.168
There's a barrier that keeps it
from coming out of the nucleus,

01:08:34.168 --> 01:08:36.510
but the barrier goes up and
comes down.

01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:38.832
So if you go a certain distance
from the nucleus,

01:08:38.832 --> 01:08:39.800
you're again free.
 

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.970
So the alpha particle does
exactly what I told you.

01:08:41.970 --> 01:08:44.462
It goes rattling back and forth
inside the nucleus and once in a

01:08:44.462 --> 01:08:46.438
while,
it penetrates and comes to the

01:08:46.438 --> 01:08:48.658
other side,
and that's the alpha decay of

01:08:48.658 --> 01:08:49.340
the nucleus.
 

01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:51.238
So this really happens.
 

01:08:51.238 --> 01:08:54.627
It may not happen to you in the
situation I described,

01:08:54.627 --> 01:08:56.800
but the probability is not
zero.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:02.000

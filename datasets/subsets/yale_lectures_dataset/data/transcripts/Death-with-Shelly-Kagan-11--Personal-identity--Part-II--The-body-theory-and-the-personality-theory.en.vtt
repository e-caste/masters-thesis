00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.119
Professor Shelly Kagan:
Last time, we turned to the

00:00:04.119 --> 00:00:06.705
question of what the
metaphysical key to personal

00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:09.647
identity might be.
What makes it be the case that

00:00:09.647 --> 00:00:12.519
one person, some person that
exists in the future,

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.261
is the same person as me.
The first approach to this that

00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:19.922
we considered was the soul
theory of personal identity:

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:23.990
the key to being the same
person is having the same soul.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.941
Same soul, same person.
Different soul,

00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:30.299
different person.
And the difficulty with that

00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:34.133
approach, even if we bracket the
question whether or not there

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.767
are souls,
the difficulty with that

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:41.387
approach was that it seems as
though the soul could constantly

00:00:41.387 --> 00:00:44.190
be changing while the
personality,

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.140
as we might call it,
stays the same.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.698
I have the same beliefs,
memories, desires,

00:00:49.698 --> 00:00:52.580
goals, preferences and so
forth.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.565
But the soul underneath it all
keeps being swapped every five

00:00:56.565 --> 00:00:59.099
minutes.
If the soul theory of personal

00:00:59.099 --> 00:01:01.780
identity were right,
that would not be me.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.651
I would be--Every five minutes
that person would die and we'd

00:01:05.651 --> 00:01:08.297
have a new person,
despite having the same

00:01:08.297 --> 00:01:11.569
personality.
Most of us find that a rather

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:15.507
difficult thing to believe,
that the person could be

00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:19.888
constantly changing in this way,
without having any way at all

00:01:19.888 --> 00:01:22.105
to tell.
And if we're not willing to

00:01:22.105 --> 00:01:25.433
accept that implication,
it seems as though we need to

00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:28.510
reject "the soul theory of
personal identity."

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.059
Now, I use this cumbersome
phrase because,

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:34.978
of course, I'm not here talking
about rejecting the existence of

00:01:34.978 --> 00:01:37.730
souls.
What I'm considering right now

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.204
is the question whether sameness
of soul is the key to being the

00:01:42.204 --> 00:01:44.307
same person.
And this is a--There's a

00:01:44.307 --> 00:01:46.340
logical distinction here that's
worth drawing.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.369
Even if you believe in souls,
you don't have to say that

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.674
having the very same soul is the
key to being the very same

00:01:56.674 --> 00:01:58.548
person.
And trivially,

00:01:58.548 --> 00:02:02.329
of course, if you don't believe
in souls, if you don't believe

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.490
that souls exist,
that you certainly can't appeal

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.650
to the existence of souls,
the continuity of soul,

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.118
the sameness of soul,
as the key to personal

00:02:11.118 --> 00:02:13.053
identity.
But we might then ask,

00:02:13.053 --> 00:02:17.156
"Well what's the alternative?"
Now, the natural alternative is

00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:21.543
to say, "The key to being the
same person is not the sameness

00:02:21.543 --> 00:02:24.550
of the soul,
whether or not it exists,

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.530
but rather having the very same
body."

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.613
And again, although I'm not
going to go on and on about this

00:02:30.613 --> 00:02:33.643
point, it's worth noticing that
even if you do believe that

00:02:33.643 --> 00:02:36.441
souls exist,
nothing stops you from

00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:40.720
accepting the body theory of
personal identity.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.311
Nothing rules out the
possibility that having the very

00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:48.580
same body is the key to being
the very same person over time.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.560
Even if you believe in souls,
you can accept the body theory.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.960
And it certainly looks as
though if you don't believe in

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.176
souls, you have to accept the
body theory of personal

00:02:59.176 --> 00:03:01.149
identity.
Now, as it turns out,

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:03.883
that appearance is deceptive.
There are still other

00:03:03.883 --> 00:03:06.619
alternatives open to the
physicalist, but let's come to

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.980
that other alternative later.
Let's take a few minutes and

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.524
consider the nature of the body
theory, the body theory of

00:03:13.524 --> 00:03:16.100
personal identity.
On this theory,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.098
of course, the secret to being
the same person is having the

00:03:21.098 --> 00:03:23.110
same body.
So when we ask,

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.815
well you remember last lecture
I was talking about how there'd

00:03:26.815 --> 00:03:29.548
be somebody here lecturing to
you, philosophy,

00:03:29.548 --> 00:03:32.110
on Tuesday.
Well, here somebody is.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.540
Is that the same person?
Is the person who's lecturing

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.326
to you now the same person as
the person who was lecturing to

00:03:40.326 --> 00:03:43.848
you before?
According to the body theory,

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:47.761
the answer is--turns on the
question, "Well,

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:53.129
is this the same body as the
lump of flesh and bone that was

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.608
here last week?"
If it is--and by the by it

00:03:57.608 --> 00:04:01.659
is--if it is,
then it's the same person.

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.650
So am I the person who was
lecturing to you last week?

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.039
Yes, I am, because it's the
very same body.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.409
That's what the body theory
says.

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.922
And unlike souls,
where it's all rather

00:04:12.922 --> 00:04:16.955
mysterious how you could tell
whether soul swapping was taking

00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:19.417
place or not,
it's not all that mysterious

00:04:19.417 --> 00:04:22.329
how we check out to see whether
the same body's been around.

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:27.223
Even though you didn't do it,
you could have snuck into my

00:04:27.223 --> 00:04:30.399
house, watched my body go to
sleep,

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:33.385
get up in the morning,
followed the body around over

00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:36.220
the course of the day,
see it go to sleep again.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.860
You could have tracked that
body through space and time and

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.240
said, "Hey look.
It's the very same body."

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.370
In the same way that we are
able to track in principle cars,

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.507
our earlier example,
and talk about yeah,

00:04:49.507 --> 00:04:54.379
it's the same hunk of metal and
wire and rubber and plastic.

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:57.120
This is the same hunk,
same body.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.980
All right, same body,
same person.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.899
That's the body theory of
personal identity.

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:08.242
Now, if we accept the body
theory, then of course if we

00:05:08.242 --> 00:05:11.399
turn to the question,
"Could I survive my death?"

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:13.649
Could I survive the death of my
body?"

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:16.020
at first glance,
it looks as though the answer's

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.290
going to have to be,
"Well, of course not."

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:24.432
Because when my body dies,
then, oh eventually the body

00:05:24.432 --> 00:05:27.414
begins to decay.
It decomposes,

00:05:27.414 --> 00:05:31.419
turns into molecules which get
absorbed into the soil or what

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.905
have you.
This may take years or decades

00:05:34.905 --> 00:05:39.022
or even centuries,
but my body no longer exists

00:05:39.022 --> 00:05:43.684
after death of my body.
And so how could I survive the

00:05:43.684 --> 00:05:47.340
death of my body,
if for me to survive the death

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.751
of my body,
there's got to be somebody

00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:52.750
who's me, and if being me
requires it being the same body,

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.259
my body would have to still be
around, but it's not.

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:58.589
That's what it looks like at
first glance.

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:04.264
But at second glance we see
that there's at least a logical

00:06:04.264 --> 00:06:08.959
possibility of surviving the
death of my body.

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:15.150
All it takes is for my body to
be put back together.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.552
Bodily resurrection.
Now I'm not going to here

00:06:20.552 --> 00:06:24.392
pursue the question of,
"Do we believe bodily

00:06:24.392 --> 00:06:27.709
resurrection occurs or will
occur?"

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:31.186
I'll note that there have been
religious traditions that have

00:06:31.186 --> 00:06:33.620
taught and believed in this
possibility.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.617
In particular,
it's probably worth mentioning

00:06:36.617 --> 00:06:40.431
that early Christians believed
in something like the body

00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:44.655
theory of personal identity and
believed in bodily resurrection

00:06:44.655 --> 00:06:47.379
that would happen on Judgment
Day.

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:51.965
We can certainly understand the
possibility that God would

00:06:51.965 --> 00:06:55.183
perform a miracle,
put the molecules back

00:06:55.183 --> 00:07:00.933
together, turn the body back on.
Same body, same person,

00:07:00.933 --> 00:07:06.220
come Judgment Day.
That's the possibility.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.446
So it's at least worth
emphasizing the fact that even

00:07:09.446 --> 00:07:14.121
if we don't believe in souls,
we could still believe in the

00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:20.100
possibility of surviving one's
death, the death of one's body,

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:25.300
if we're willing to believe in
bodily resurrection.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.740
Well, that's how it looks.
Now let's take a harder look.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:35.483
Talking that way assumes that
when you put the body back

00:07:35.483 --> 00:07:41.957
together, when God puts the body
back together on Judgment Day,

00:07:41.957 --> 00:07:47.470
that that's still my body.
Is that right?

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.019
I'm inclined to think it is
right.

00:07:50.019 --> 00:07:53.399
If God gathers up all the
various molecules that had

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:56.447
composed my body,
reassembles them in the right

00:07:56.447 --> 00:07:58.794
order,
putting this calcium molecule

00:07:58.794 --> 00:08:01.990
next to that hydrogen molecule
and so forth and so on,

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.671
reassembles them in the right
way--obviously if what He makes

00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:08.310
out of my body's molecules is a
Cadillac,

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.135
then that's not my body--but if
He puts them together in the

00:08:11.135 --> 00:08:13.529
right way, that seems like it
should be my body.

00:08:13.529 --> 00:08:17.709
So here's an analogy to give
you a sense of what's going on.

00:08:17.709 --> 00:08:23.131
Suppose I take my watch to the
jeweler because it stopped

00:08:23.131 --> 00:08:25.976
working.
And in order to clean it and

00:08:25.976 --> 00:08:28.993
fix it, repair it,
what the jeweler does is he

00:08:28.993 --> 00:08:32.490
takes it apart.
He takes the rust off of the

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:36.090
gears, if there are still gears
in watches.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.904
Imagine it's an old stop watch.
And he cleans all the pieces

00:08:38.904 --> 00:08:42.236
and buffs them and polishes them
and then reassembles the whole

00:08:42.236 --> 00:08:43.552
thing.
And a week later,

00:08:43.552 --> 00:08:45.560
I come back and ask,
"Where's my watch?"

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.669
And he hands it to me.
Well, all well and good.

00:08:48.669 --> 00:08:52.063
Now imagine some metaphysician
saying, "Wait a minute,

00:08:52.063 --> 00:08:54.000
buster.
Not so quick.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.113
That's not my watch.
Admittedly, it's composed of

00:08:59.113 --> 00:09:03.730
all the very same pieces that
made up my watch.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:09.022
Admittedly, all these pieces
are in the very same order as my

00:09:09.022 --> 00:09:12.549
watch, but still that's not my
watch."

00:09:12.549 --> 00:09:15.751
On the contrary,
it seems to me the right thing

00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:19.580
to say about that example is,
"No, that is my watch."

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.899
My watch was disassembled for a
period of time.

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:28.972
Perhaps we should say my watch
didn't exist during that period

00:09:28.972 --> 00:09:31.100
of time.
But it got put back together.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.840
Now that's my watch.
If that's the right thing to

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.268
say about the watch--and it does
seem to me to be the right thing

00:09:39.268 --> 00:09:42.483
to say about the watch--then God
could presumably do the same

00:09:42.483 --> 00:09:45.828
thing on Judgment Day.
He could take our molecules,

00:09:45.828 --> 00:09:49.625
which had been scattered,
put them back together and say,

00:09:49.625 --> 00:09:52.429
"Ha!
That's your body."

00:09:52.429 --> 00:09:56.583
And if the body theory of
personal identity is right,

00:09:56.583 --> 00:10:00.360
well, that would be me.
So it seems to me.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.703
But there's a different example
that we have to worry about as

00:10:04.703 --> 00:10:08.905
well, which argues against this
proposal that the body could

00:10:08.905 --> 00:10:11.539
decompose and then be
recomposed.

00:10:11.539 --> 00:10:15.100
This is an example that's due
to Peter van Inwagen.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.676
He's a contemporary
metaphysician,

00:10:17.676 --> 00:10:23.485
teaches at Notre Dame.
Suppose that my son builds a

00:10:23.485 --> 00:10:28.573
tower out of wooden blocks.
We have a set of wooden blocks

00:10:28.573 --> 00:10:31.196
at home.
Suppose that he builds some

00:10:31.196 --> 00:10:34.539
elaborate tower.
It's very impressive.

00:10:34.539 --> 00:10:37.202
And he says,
"Please show it to mom when she

00:10:37.202 --> 00:10:39.620
comes home."
And he goes to bed.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.980
And I'm very good.
I'm cleaning up the house after

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:49.370
he goes to bed and oops,
I knock over the tower.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.780
I say, "Oh my god,
he's going to be so angry.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.748
I promised him I'd be careful."
So what I do is I take the

00:10:55.748 --> 00:11:00.040
blocks and I put them back
together, building a tower in

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:04.019
the very same shape and the very
same structure,

00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:09.299
the very same order as the
tower that my son had built.

00:11:09.299 --> 00:11:13.089
And in fact I'm so
careful--perhaps the blocks are

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:17.575
numbered--I'm so careful that
every block is in exactly the

00:11:17.575 --> 00:11:21.830
same position as in the case
where my son built it.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:26.885
All right, I rebuild or I build
this tower and my wife comes

00:11:26.885 --> 00:11:30.570
home and I say,
"Look what our son built.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:35.240
This is the tower that our son
built."

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:40.850
Ah, that doesn't sound right.
That's not the tower that our

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.870
son built.
That's a tower that I built.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:49.173
This is a duplicate tower.
Sure, if my son were to wake up

00:11:49.173 --> 00:11:53.690
and I didn't tell him,
he wouldn't know that it was a

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:57.667
duplicate.
But when you take a wooden

00:11:57.667 --> 00:12:03.909
block tower apart and then put
the pieces back together,

00:12:03.909 --> 00:12:10.063
piece for piece,
duplicate, you don't have the

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:16.080
very same tower that you started
out with.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.883
That's what van Inwagen says
and, I've got to admit,

00:12:19.883 --> 00:12:22.810
sounds right to me.
If I were to point to that

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.165
tower and say,
"Ari built that," I'd be saying

00:12:25.165 --> 00:12:28.234
something false.
"That's the very same tower

00:12:28.234 --> 00:12:33.145
that Ari built."
No, I'd be saying something

00:12:33.145 --> 00:12:36.170
false.
So van Inwagen concludes,

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:41.021
if you have an object and you
take it apart and then put it

00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:45.696
all back together again,
you don't have the very same

00:12:45.696 --> 00:12:48.629
object that you started out
with.

00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:52.984
So even if Judgment Day were to
come, and God were to reassemble

00:12:52.984 --> 00:12:55.679
the molecules and resurrect the
body,

00:12:55.679 --> 00:13:01.440
it's not the very same body
that you started out with.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.584
And if having the very same
body is the key to personal

00:13:06.584 --> 00:13:10.110
identity, it's not the same
person.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:15.529
Come Judgment Day,
we've got a duplicate of me,

00:13:15.529 --> 00:13:19.500
but we don't have me.
That's what van Inwagen would

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.890
say, if that's the way bodily
resurrection would work.

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.377
I don't know,
theology aside,

00:13:28.377 --> 00:13:32.100
I don't know what to say about
the metaphysical questions.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:37.575
When I think about the tower
case, I do find myself inclined

00:13:37.575 --> 00:13:42.401
to say, with van Inwagen,
that's not the tower my son

00:13:42.401 --> 00:13:46.089
built.
But when I think about the

00:13:46.089 --> 00:13:52.669
watch case, I find myself saying
that is the very same watch.

00:13:52.669 --> 00:13:57.660
Now, all I can do is invite you
to think about these two cases

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.259
and ask yourself,
what should we say here?

00:14:01.259 --> 00:14:05.275
Of course, for those people who
think it really is the same

00:14:05.275 --> 00:14:07.199
tower, no problem.
Then we say,

00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:08.907
the watch and the tower,
in both cases,

00:14:08.907 --> 00:14:11.200
it's the very same object when
it's reassembled.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.724
Reassemble the body,
that'll be the very same body

00:14:13.724 --> 00:14:15.651
as well.
For those people who say,

00:14:15.651 --> 00:14:18.134
"Yeah, van Inwagen was right
about the tower,

00:14:18.134 --> 00:14:21.070
and the same thing would be
true about the watch.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:25.056
The reassembled watch isn't the
very same watch," then we have

00:14:25.056 --> 00:14:28.911
to say bodily resurrection would
not be the very same

00:14:28.911 --> 00:14:32.944
body.
So that wouldn't be me waking

00:14:32.944 --> 00:14:37.451
up on Judgment Day.
The alternative is to try to

00:14:37.451 --> 00:14:41.944
find some relevant difference
between the watch case and the

00:14:41.944 --> 00:14:45.392
tower case.
Something that allows us to say

00:14:45.392 --> 00:14:50.309
that "well, when you reassemble
the watch it is the same watch.

00:14:50.309 --> 00:14:54.049
When you reassemble the tower,
it's not the same tower.

00:14:54.049 --> 00:14:57.190
Here's the explanation of why
those two things work

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.639
differently in the reassembly
cases."

00:14:59.639 --> 00:15:01.816
And then of course,
we'd have to further

00:15:01.816 --> 00:15:04.549
investigate whether when you
reassemble a body,

00:15:04.549 --> 00:15:09.002
is it more like the watch case
or is it more like the tower

00:15:09.002 --> 00:15:11.260
case?
I just have to confess,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:15.451
I don't know what the best
thing to say about these cases

00:15:15.451 --> 00:15:17.965
is.
I find myself inclined to think

00:15:17.965 --> 00:15:20.029
reassembled watch,
same watch.

00:15:20.029 --> 00:15:22.820
Reassembled tower,
not same tower.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.370
Maybe there's a difference
there.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.460
I don't have a good theory as
to what the difference is.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.440
Since I don't have a good
theory as to what the difference

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.630
is, I'm not in a good position
to decide whether a reassembled

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.350
body would be the same body or a
different body.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:41.066
I don't know.
So there's metaphysical work to

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:46.405
be done here by anybody who's at
least interested in getting this

00:15:46.405 --> 00:15:49.909
theory of identity worked out
properly.

00:15:49.909 --> 00:15:53.081
Still, at least the possibility
that we could work this out is

00:15:53.081 --> 00:15:56.072
still there.
So I suppose there's still at

00:15:56.072 --> 00:16:00.285
least the possibility that
bodily resurrection would be

00:16:00.285 --> 00:16:05.200
coherent in such a way that it
would still be the same body.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.531
So if we accept the body
theory, could there be life

00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:12.113
after death?
Could there be survival of the

00:16:12.113 --> 00:16:14.645
death of my body?
Seems like, as far as I can

00:16:14.645 --> 00:16:18.414
tell, it's still a possibility,
although there's some puzzles

00:16:18.414 --> 00:16:21.679
here that I don't know how to
see my way through.

00:16:21.679 --> 00:16:26.209
Mind you, that's not to say
that I myself do believe that

00:16:26.209 --> 00:16:30.496
there will be a Judgment Day,
and on that day God will

00:16:30.496 --> 00:16:34.156
reassemble the bodies.
But it at least seems like a

00:16:34.156 --> 00:16:35.380
coherent possibility.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:45.937
Let's refine the body view.
I've been suggesting that the

00:16:45.937 --> 00:16:48.960
key here, the idea of whether
it's the same person or not,

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.473
is whether it's the same body.
But of course as we know in

00:16:52.473 --> 00:16:56.326
thinking about familiar objects,
we don't need to have every

00:16:56.326 --> 00:16:58.992
single piece of an object,
of an entity,

00:16:58.992 --> 00:17:01.250
stay the same to have the same
thing.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:05.704
So I think I previously talked
about the steering wheel in my

00:17:05.704 --> 00:17:08.209
car.
Every time I drive the steering

00:17:08.209 --> 00:17:10.800
wheel in my car,
I rub off some atoms.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.385
But that's okay.
It's still the very same

00:17:12.385 --> 00:17:16.085
physical object.
The steering wheel is--Having

00:17:16.085 --> 00:17:21.804
the same steering wheel is
compatible with changing of a

00:17:21.804 --> 00:17:25.403
few pieces.
The same thing is true for

00:17:25.403 --> 00:17:27.839
bodies, right?
You get sunburned,

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.906
your skin peels,
you've lost some atoms in your

00:17:30.906 --> 00:17:32.780
body.
It doesn't really matter.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.426
It's still the very same body.
So if body is the key to

00:17:36.426 --> 00:17:39.389
personal identity,
we don't have to worry about

00:17:39.389 --> 00:17:43.190
the fact that we're constantly
gaining and losing atoms.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:47.651
Yes, question?
Student: What about

00:17:47.651 --> 00:17:53.460
someone who loses a huge amount
of weight?

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:53.849
Professor Shelly Kagan:
Good.

00:17:53.849 --> 00:17:56.803
The question was,
"What about somebody who loses

00:17:56.803 --> 00:18:00.020
a huge amount of weight?"
They feel different.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.960
People treat them different.
What about that case?

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.990
Well, I think if we're doing
metaphysics, as opposed to

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:11.491
psychology--Psychologically,
we understand why losing weight

00:18:11.491 --> 00:18:16.160
might make a real difference as
to how you feel about yourself.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.591
And we might even say,
loosely, it's as though she's a

00:18:20.591 --> 00:18:24.163
whole new person.
But strictly speaking,

00:18:24.163 --> 00:18:28.759
we don't think it is literally
a whole new person.

00:18:28.759 --> 00:18:32.500
It's not as though we say,
"Poor Linda died when she

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:36.897
entered the spa.
Or a week into the spa when she

00:18:36.897 --> 00:18:41.549
dropped those 50 pounds.
Somebody else who remembers all

00:18:41.549 --> 00:18:44.980
of Linda's childhood,
some imitator came along."

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.200
We don't say "different person."
We say "same person,

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.571
lost a lot of weight."
Now that's not a problem for

00:18:51.571 --> 00:18:53.817
the body view,
because on the body view,

00:18:53.817 --> 00:18:56.119
the question is,
is it the same body?

00:18:56.119 --> 00:18:59.777
And what we want to say is,
of course, look,

00:18:59.777 --> 00:19:04.880
just like it's still your body
even if you break your arm.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.456
Even though--It's still your
body after you've eaten dinner,

00:19:08.456 --> 00:19:11.971
and so now some molecules have
been absorbed into your body

00:19:11.971 --> 00:19:16.691
that weren't there before.
It's still your body after you

00:19:16.691 --> 00:19:21.140
lose some molecules,
even a lot of molecules.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:27.808
There can be changes in your
body that are compatible with it

00:19:27.808 --> 00:19:33.314
still being the same body.
Now, we might worry about

00:19:33.314 --> 00:19:36.824
the--Which changes?
Are all the changes,

00:19:36.824 --> 00:19:40.730
it's certainly not as though
any change will do.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:44.691
I mean, suppose what happens is
Linda goes to bed and what we do

00:19:44.691 --> 00:19:48.715
in the middle of the night is we
take away that body and put some

00:19:48.715 --> 00:19:51.201
new body there.
Well that 100% change,

00:19:51.201 --> 00:19:52.670
that's clearly too much.

00:19:55.839 --> 00:20:00.188
Change of some small
percentage, from eating,

00:20:00.188 --> 00:20:03.599
not a problem.
Change from a somewhat larger

00:20:03.599 --> 00:20:07.446
percentage of losing a fair bit
of weight doesn't seem to be a

00:20:07.446 --> 00:20:11.410
problem.
So which changes in bodies make

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:17.528
for a different body and which
changes in body make for the

00:20:17.528 --> 00:20:19.942
same body?
And in particular,

00:20:19.942 --> 00:20:23.477
how should we run that if we're
thinking about the body as the

00:20:23.477 --> 00:20:26.961
key to personal identity?
I think if we have that

00:20:26.961 --> 00:20:31.896
question in front of our minds,
we're going to want to say not

00:20:31.896 --> 00:20:35.700
all parts of the body are
equally important.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.926
You lose a fair bit of weight,
some fat from your gut,

00:20:38.926 --> 00:20:40.714
not a problem.
Here's one of my favorite

00:20:40.714 --> 00:20:44.395
examples.
In the Star Wars movies,

00:20:44.395 --> 00:20:52.923
Darth Vader whips out his light
saber and slashes off the hand

00:20:52.923 --> 00:20:57.230
of Luke Skywalker.
"Luke, I am your father."

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.400
"No!"
Then the hand goes, right?

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.907
The very next scene--this has
always amazed me--the very next

00:21:03.907 --> 00:21:07.590
scene, Luke's got an artificial
hand that's been attached to his

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:10.280
body and they never even mention
it again.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:16.456
No one says, "Oh, poor Luke.
He died when Darth Vader cut

00:21:16.456 --> 00:21:21.255
off the hand."
It seems pretty clear that not

00:21:21.255 --> 00:21:27.322
all parts of the body matter.
You can lose a hand and still

00:21:27.322 --> 00:21:31.545
survive.
Same body, except now without a

00:21:31.545 --> 00:21:34.703
hand.
Suppose Darth Vader had aimed a

00:21:34.703 --> 00:21:38.380
little higher and cut off Luke's
entire arm.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.839
It would still be Luke.
It would still be Luke's body.

00:21:41.839 --> 00:21:46.457
Suppose, even worse,
Darth Vader slices off both

00:21:46.457 --> 00:21:50.470
arms and both legs.
It would still be Luke.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.874
It would still be Luke's body,
though now without arms and

00:21:52.874 --> 00:21:53.170
legs.

00:21:56.289 --> 00:22:00.480
What part of the body,
if any, is essential?

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.729
Well here's a proposal.
It seems to me we'd say

00:22:04.729 --> 00:22:09.109
something rather different if
what happened was that what got

00:22:09.109 --> 00:22:13.273
destroyed was Luke's brain.
Suppose that Darth Vader uses

00:22:13.273 --> 00:22:17.289
the force--the dark side of the
force of course--Darth Vader

00:22:17.289 --> 00:22:20.420
uses the dark side of the force
to destroy,

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:26.019
to turn into pea soup,
Luke Skywalker's brain.

00:22:26.019 --> 00:22:28.726
Now I think we might want to
say, "Well look,

00:22:28.726 --> 00:22:32.936
no more Luke."
And if what happens is they

00:22:32.936 --> 00:22:39.390
drag out some replacement brain,
it's still not Luke.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:45.119
At least, that's a possible
version of the body view.

00:22:45.119 --> 00:22:48.617
According to this version,
which I take to be the most

00:22:48.617 --> 00:22:51.720
promising, the best version of
the body view,

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.436
the crucial question in
thinking about personal identity

00:22:54.436 --> 00:22:57.104
is whether it's the same
body--but not all parts of the

00:22:57.104 --> 00:23:00.959
body matter equally.
The most important part of the

00:23:00.959 --> 00:23:03.960
body is the brain.
Well, why the brain?

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.674
No surprise there,
because of course the brain is

00:23:07.674 --> 00:23:11.543
the part, we now know,
the brain is the part of the

00:23:11.543 --> 00:23:15.180
body that is the house of your
personality,

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.196
your beliefs,
your desires,

00:23:17.196 --> 00:23:21.540
your fears, your ambitions,
your goals, your memories.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:27.792
That's all housed in the brain.
And so that's the part of the

00:23:27.792 --> 00:23:34.240
brain that's the key part of the
body for the purpose of personal

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.339
identity.
That's what I'm inclined to

00:23:37.339 --> 00:23:40.420
think is the best version of the
body view.

00:23:45.559 --> 00:23:51.680
We find examples of this
thought, that the brain is the

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.887
key, in odd places.
So let me actually share one

00:23:55.887 --> 00:23:58.351
with you.
This was something from the

00:23:58.351 --> 00:24:01.839
Internet that my brother sent to
me some years ago.

00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:06.948
It purports to be from a
transcript from an actual trial

00:24:06.948 --> 00:24:11.500
in which a lawyer's cross
examining the doctor.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.397
And you'll see.
I don't actually know whether

00:24:14.397 --> 00:24:16.479
it's true or not,
whether it's just somebody made

00:24:16.479 --> 00:24:18.680
it up.
But it purports to be true.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.149
Q: Doctor,
before you performed the

00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:24.880
autopsy, did you check for a
pulse?

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.790
A: No.
Q: Did you check for

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.920
blood pressure?
A: No.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.410
Q: Did you check for
breathing?

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:38.757
A: No.
Q: So then it is

00:24:38.757 --> 00:24:43.612
possible that the patient was
alive when you began the

00:24:43.612 --> 00:24:46.970
autopsy?
A: No.

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:51.279
Q: How can you be so
sure, doctor?

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:58.019
A: Because his brain was
sitting on my desk in a jar.

00:24:58.019 --> 00:25:02.591
Q: But could the patient
have still been alive

00:25:02.591 --> 00:25:06.722
nevertheless?
A: It is possible that

00:25:06.722 --> 00:25:12.640
he could have been alive and
practicing law somewhere.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:17.911
The point--The reason that this
is funny, other than of course

00:25:17.911 --> 00:25:21.627
the obvious moral,
which is that lawyers are

00:25:21.627 --> 00:25:25.453
morons, is that of course.
Why is it so clear the lawyer's

00:25:25.453 --> 00:25:27.954
got to be a moron?
Because of course we think,

00:25:27.954 --> 00:25:31.120
look, lose a hand,
the guy could still be alive.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.201
Lose an arm, lose a leg.
Lose the brain,

00:25:35.201 --> 00:25:38.253
he's not alive.
So again this is,

00:25:38.253 --> 00:25:42.734
this is hardly philosophical
proof, but it shows that we're

00:25:42.734 --> 00:25:47.060
drawn to the thought that the
key part of the body is the

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.104
brain.
Now, think about what the

00:25:49.104 --> 00:25:50.730
implication of holding that
view.

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:56.150
Suppose we adopt that version
of the body view.

00:25:56.150 --> 00:26:04.259
If I get a liver transplant,
so here I am and we take out my

00:26:04.259 --> 00:26:09.620
liver and we put Jones' liver
inside.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:14.079
I've gotten a liver transplant.
It's still me.

00:26:14.079 --> 00:26:20.240
Suppose we rip out my heart and
put Jones' heart in here.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:25.359
I've gotten a heart transplant.
It's still me.

00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:31.060
Suppose we rip out my lungs and
put in Jones' lungs.

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:35.990
I've gotten a lung transplant.
It's still me.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:42.279
Suppose we rip out my brain,
put in Jones' brain.

00:26:42.279 --> 00:26:45.730
Have I gotten a brain
transplant?

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:50.269
No.
What's happened is that

00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:55.660
Jones has gotten a
body transplant.

00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:00.200
Or, as we might put it,
a torso transplant.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:04.705
If we accept this version of
the body theory,

00:27:04.705 --> 00:27:10.747
we say the crucial part of the
body for personal identity is

00:27:10.747 --> 00:27:17.253
not sameness of torso.
The crucial part of the body is

00:27:17.253 --> 00:27:21.409
sameness of brain.
Just like "follow the soul" was

00:27:21.409 --> 00:27:24.543
the answer if we believe in the
soul theory of personal

00:27:24.543 --> 00:27:27.850
identity,
if we believe in the brain

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:32.770
version of the body theory of
personal identity,

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:37.770
same person or not?
Follow the brain.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:42.512
Same brain, same person.
Different brain,

00:27:42.512 --> 00:27:46.666
different person.
As I've now been saying several

00:27:46.666 --> 00:27:49.979
times, I think that's the best
version of the body view,

00:27:49.979 --> 00:27:52.869
although not all body theorists
believe that.

00:27:52.869 --> 00:27:56.152
As you know from reading your
Perry, the assigned reading,

00:27:56.152 --> 00:27:59.549
his Dialogue on Personal
Identity and Immortality,

00:27:59.549 --> 00:28:04.314
the heroine of that story,
Gertrude--Gertrude actually

00:28:04.314 --> 00:28:08.539
thinks the key part of the body
is the torso.

00:28:08.539 --> 00:28:12.850
Follow the torso,
follow the person.

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:15.920
That's what she thinks.
I'm inclined to say, no.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.783
In those moods,
when I accept the body theory,

00:28:18.783 --> 00:28:21.710
I'm inclined to think,
no, follow the brain.

00:28:25.579 --> 00:28:29.514
Gertrude would presumably say
you get a brain transplant,

00:28:29.514 --> 00:28:33.589
you got a brain transplant,
because it's the same torso.

00:28:33.589 --> 00:28:36.705
I want to say,
as a fan of the brain theory,

00:28:36.705 --> 00:28:40.472
you get a brain transplant,
what's really happened is

00:28:40.472 --> 00:28:43.950
somebody else has gotten a torso
transplant.

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:47.790
Follow the brain.
How much of the brain?

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:53.684
Do we need all of the brain?
Well, just like we didn't have

00:28:53.684 --> 00:28:58.883
to follow the parts of the body
that aren't essential for

00:28:58.883 --> 00:29:03.847
housing the personality,
we might ask ourselves,

00:29:03.847 --> 00:29:09.829
"Do we need all of the brain to
house the personality?"

00:29:09.829 --> 00:29:14.356
Research suggests that there's
a fair bit of redundancy in the

00:29:14.356 --> 00:29:18.444
brain.
You can lose portions of the

00:29:18.444 --> 00:29:25.682
brain and still have a perfectly
functioning, P-functioning

00:29:25.682 --> 00:29:29.165
person.
Some of you may know that there

00:29:29.165 --> 00:29:33.421
have been experiments in which,
for one reason or the other,

00:29:33.421 --> 00:29:37.099
the two halves of the brain
have been separated.

00:29:37.099 --> 00:29:42.664
And you often end up there
with, well, something closer to

00:29:42.664 --> 00:29:46.960
two persons being housed within
one skull,

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.930
because they can often still
communicate in various ways.

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:53.355
We don't quite get that.
I gather that the best research

00:29:53.355 --> 00:29:56.562
suggests we don't really have
complete redundancy with

00:29:56.562 --> 00:29:59.480
hemispheres.
But suppose that we did.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.261
Let's be science-fictiony.
Suppose that,

00:30:03.261 --> 00:30:08.218
as a kind of backup security,
what evolution has done is

00:30:08.218 --> 00:30:13.536
produced so much redundancy in
the brain that either half of

00:30:13.536 --> 00:30:17.705
the brain would suffice.
All right, so think about our

00:30:17.705 --> 00:30:21.990
brain transplant example.
So there's an accident with

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:29.230
Jones and Smith.
Jones' torso gets destroyed.

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:34.096
His brain is fine.
Smith's brain has gotten

00:30:34.096 --> 00:30:37.350
destroyed.
His torso is fine.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:42.400
We take Jones' brain;
we put it in Smith's torso.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.210
We hook up all the wires,
as it were.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:48.710
The thing wakes up.
Who is that?

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:52.160
Jones' brain, Smith's torso.
Follow the brain.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:57.150
That's Jones that woke up.
Version two.

00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:01.106
Horrible accident.
Jones' torso has been destroyed

00:31:01.106 --> 00:31:05.000
and the left half of his brain
has been destroyed.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.730
But the right half of his brain
is still there.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:13.826
Smith's torso is fine,
but his entire brain has been

00:31:13.826 --> 00:31:17.137
destroyed.
We take the right half of

00:31:17.137 --> 00:31:20.799
Jones' brain,
put it into Smith's torso,

00:31:20.799 --> 00:31:26.340
hook up all the wires the right
way, the thing wakes up.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.809
Who is it?
It's Jones.

00:31:29.809 --> 00:31:33.615
Follow the brain,
and more particularly,

00:31:33.615 --> 00:31:39.274
follow however much of the
brain it takes to have enough of

00:31:39.274 --> 00:31:44.250
the brain there to still give
you the memories,

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:47.390
beliefs, desires,
and so forth and so on.

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:50.455
If it were true--it probably
isn't true, but if it were

00:31:50.455 --> 00:31:53.804
true--that half of the brain was
enough, then half the brain

00:31:53.804 --> 00:31:56.600
would be enough.
That would be Jones that woke

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.069
up.
Question?

00:31:58.069 --> 00:32:03.015
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Shelly Kagan:

00:32:03.015 --> 00:32:04.816
Great.
The question was,

00:32:04.816 --> 00:32:07.745
"On this theory,
what do we say about the case

00:32:07.745 --> 00:32:10.869
where we take the two halves of
Jones' brain,

00:32:10.869 --> 00:32:13.340
split them, put them in two
different torsos.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:17.110
They both wake up.
Would they both be Jones?"

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:21.478
That's a wonderful question.
It's a wonderful case to think

00:32:21.478 --> 00:32:24.410
about and, indeed,
I am going to come back to it.

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:28.609
But I just want to bracket it
for the time being.

00:32:28.609 --> 00:32:33.579
But it's a great question to
keep in mind as you think about

00:32:33.579 --> 00:32:36.779
the plausibility of the body
theory.

00:32:36.779 --> 00:32:41.784
All right, so I'm inclined to
think that the best version of

00:32:41.784 --> 00:32:46.279
the body theory has to do with
following the brain.

00:32:46.279 --> 00:32:48.959
So one thing that a
physicalist, who does not

00:32:48.959 --> 00:32:51.700
believe in souls,
one thing that a physicalist

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.136
could say is,
"What's the key to personal

00:32:54.136 --> 00:32:56.160
identity?
The body.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:01.636
Sameness of body."
And then I'm inclined to think

00:33:01.636 --> 00:33:05.960
the best version of the body
view is the brain view.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.819
So that's something that a
physicalist can say.

00:33:08.819 --> 00:33:11.128
And for that matter,
it's something that a soul,

00:33:11.128 --> 00:33:13.708
somebody who believes in souls,
could say as well:

00:33:13.708 --> 00:33:16.582
even though there are souls,
that may not be the key to

00:33:16.582 --> 00:33:20.705
personal identity.
Maybe sameness of body is the

00:33:20.705 --> 00:33:25.042
key to personal identity.
That's something a physicalist

00:33:25.042 --> 00:33:28.431
or dualist can say.
But, and this is not--to make

00:33:28.431 --> 00:33:31.265
good on a promissory note I
offered earlier,

00:33:31.265 --> 00:33:34.890
it's not the only view
available to physicalists or,

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:40.542
for that matter, dualists.
Even if there are no souls,

00:33:40.542 --> 00:33:45.747
we don't have to say that the
key to personal identity is the

00:33:45.747 --> 00:33:51.757
sameness of the body.
We could instead say the key to

00:33:51.757 --> 00:33:58.599
personal identity is the
sameness of the personality.

00:33:58.599 --> 00:34:03.478
After all, go back to the
Lockean worries about the soul

00:34:03.478 --> 00:34:08.688
theory of personal identity.
It seemed very hard to believe

00:34:08.688 --> 00:34:13.614
that it isn't the same person
when the memories and beliefs

00:34:13.614 --> 00:34:18.370
and desires and goals and
ambitions and fears are all the

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:21.386
same,
even if a soul is constantly

00:34:21.386 --> 00:34:23.587
changing.
It seems as though we wanted to

00:34:23.587 --> 00:34:25.179
say same person.
Why?

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:28.402
Roughly speaking,
because it's the same

00:34:28.402 --> 00:34:31.325
personality.
And with the body view,

00:34:31.325 --> 00:34:35.323
when I started arguing a few
moments ago that the best

00:34:35.323 --> 00:34:38.870
version of the body view was the
brain view,

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:42.452
why did that seem plausible?
Why didn't we say that Luke

00:34:42.452 --> 00:34:46.253
died when he lost his wrist?
Because the brain,

00:34:46.253 --> 00:34:50.596
after all, was the part of the
body that houses the

00:34:50.596 --> 00:34:53.223
personality.
Enough of the brain was good

00:34:53.223 --> 00:34:56.490
enough, I said.
What counts as good enough?

00:34:56.490 --> 00:35:01.000
Enough to keep the personality.
Well, if what we think is

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.850
really important here is the
personality, why don't we just

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:10.449
say the key to personal identity
is the personality?

00:35:10.449 --> 00:35:17.646
Let's just say it's me,
provided that there's somebody

00:35:17.646 --> 00:35:23.349
who's got the same set of
beliefs, desires,

00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:28.510
goals, memories,
ambitions, fears.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:34.909
To coin a word,
the same "personality."

00:35:34.909 --> 00:35:40.691
So the secret to personal
identity on this new proposal

00:35:40.691 --> 00:35:46.580
isn't sameness of body,
it's sameness of personality.

00:35:53.679 --> 00:35:59.241
Now, it's important to bear in
mind that this view is perfectly

00:35:59.241 --> 00:36:02.650
compatible with being a
physicalist.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:07.100
After all, we're not saying
that in order to have

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:12.199
personalities you need to have
something nonphysical.

00:36:12.199 --> 00:36:16.717
As physicalists,
we can still say that the basis

00:36:16.717 --> 00:36:22.676
of personality is that there are
bodies that are functioning in

00:36:22.676 --> 00:36:25.776
certain ways.
But for all that,

00:36:25.776 --> 00:36:30.176
the key to the same person
could have to do with the

00:36:30.176 --> 00:36:34.489
personality rather than the
sameness of bodies.

00:36:34.489 --> 00:36:40.321
Of course, normally the way you
get the same personality is by

00:36:40.321 --> 00:36:43.940
having the same body.
Still, if we ask,

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:47.449
"What's doing the metaphysical
work here?

00:36:47.449 --> 00:36:52.050
What's the key to being the
same person?"

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:56.228
we can say sameness of body
gave us the same personality,

00:36:56.228 --> 00:37:00.183
but it was sameness of
personality that made it be the

00:37:00.183 --> 00:37:01.750
very same person.

00:37:05.519 --> 00:37:09.524
Could there be some way to get
sameness of personality while

00:37:09.524 --> 00:37:12.630
not having sameness of body?
Maybe.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:16.050
Suppose that we had some
disease.

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:19.390
The doctor tells me the
horrible news that I'm going to

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:23.225
have some disease that's going
to eventually turn my brain into

00:37:23.225 --> 00:37:25.019
pea soup.
But luckily,

00:37:25.019 --> 00:37:28.813
just before it does it,
they can take all of my

00:37:28.813 --> 00:37:34.010
personality and put it into an
artificial replacement brain.

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:36.119
So there'll be --just like you
can have artificial hearts,

00:37:36.119 --> 00:37:38.985
artificial livers,
you can have artificial brains,

00:37:38.985 --> 00:37:42.550
which will get imprinted with
the same personality.

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:44.475
Same memory,
same beliefs,

00:37:44.475 --> 00:37:47.480
same desires,
same fears, same goals.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:51.340
We obviously can't do that.
This is a science fiction story.

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:54.614
But at least it allows you to
see how the body and the

00:37:54.614 --> 00:37:58.343
personality could come apart.
And so we could have same

00:37:58.343 --> 00:38:01.679
personality without literally
the same brain.

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:05.275
If personality is the key to
personal identity,

00:38:05.275 --> 00:38:08.462
that would still be me.
Hold off again for a few

00:38:08.462 --> 00:38:10.208
minutes, at least,
on the question,

00:38:10.208 --> 00:38:12.313
"So what should we believe
here, the body,

00:38:12.313 --> 00:38:16.566
the personality view?"
Let's try to refine the

00:38:16.566 --> 00:38:21.323
personality theory.
So again, the point I was just

00:38:21.323 --> 00:38:25.548
emphasizing was even if we
accept the personality theory,

00:38:25.548 --> 00:38:29.170
this doesn't threaten our being
physicalists.

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:31.579
We can still say the reason
that we've got the same

00:38:31.579 --> 00:38:34.581
personality in the normal case,
is there's some physical

00:38:34.581 --> 00:38:37.170
explanation of what houses the
personality.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:41.497
But for all that,
the key to personal identity is

00:38:41.497 --> 00:38:44.623
same personality.
Notice, by the way,

00:38:44.623 --> 00:38:48.790
that somebody who believes in
souls could also accept the

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:51.990
personality theory of personal
identity.

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:56.530
Locke believed in souls.
He just didn't think they were

00:38:56.530 --> 00:39:00.000
the key to personal identity.
So you might think, "Oh no.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.325
The physicalist is wrong when
the physicalist says that

00:39:03.325 --> 00:39:05.911
personality--memory,
belief, consciousness,

00:39:05.911 --> 00:39:08.989
what have you--is housed or
based in the body.

00:39:08.989 --> 00:39:11.790
It's based in an immaterial
soul."

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:16.080
Dualists could say that.
And yet, for all that,

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:21.176
the dualist could consistently
say, "Still, same soul is not

00:39:21.176 --> 00:39:26.719
the key to personal identity.
Same personality is the key to

00:39:26.719 --> 00:39:30.530
personal identity.
If God replaces my soul every

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:34.771
10 minutes, as long as He does
it in such a way as to imprint

00:39:34.771 --> 00:39:37.670
the very same personality on the
soul,

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:40.579
it doesn't matter any more than
it didn't matter whether or not

00:39:40.579 --> 00:39:42.409
some of my body parts were
changing."

00:39:42.409 --> 00:39:46.994
So the personality theory of
personal identity can be

00:39:46.994 --> 00:39:52.460
accepted by physicalists and it
can be accepted by dualists.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:02.439
So, just to keep score,
right now we've got three basic

00:40:02.439 --> 00:40:06.480
theories of personal identity on
the table.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.650
The soul theory,
the key to personal identity is

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:11.725
the same soul.
The body theory,

00:40:11.725 --> 00:40:14.650
the key to personal identity is
the same body.

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:17.392
Where the best version,
I think, is the brain version

00:40:17.392 --> 00:40:20.509
of the body theory.
And the personality theory,

00:40:20.509 --> 00:40:24.303
the key to personal identity is
having the very same

00:40:24.303 --> 00:40:25.420
personality.

00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:33.750
Well again, we've got to be
careful about refining this.

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:37.340
Just like we all agreed,
I suppose, that you can have

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:40.655
the very same body,
even though some of the parts

00:40:40.655 --> 00:40:43.192
come and go,
atoms get added,

00:40:43.192 --> 00:40:48.566
other atoms get knocked off.
We can say, we'd better say,

00:40:48.566 --> 00:40:54.713
that you can have the very same
personality even if some of the

00:40:54.713 --> 00:40:58.579
elements in your personality
change.

00:40:58.579 --> 00:41:03.297
After all, we defined the
personality in terms of it being

00:41:03.297 --> 00:41:08.263
a set of beliefs and memories
and desires and goals and fears

00:41:08.263 --> 00:41:12.119
and so forth.
But those things are constantly

00:41:12.119 --> 00:41:15.370
changing.
I have all sorts of memories

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.710
now that I didn't have when I
was 10.

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:20.560
I have memories of getting
married, for example.

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:25.876
I wasn't married when I was 10.
So does the personality

00:41:25.876 --> 00:41:30.870
theorist have to say,
"Uh-oh, different personality.

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:35.167
That kid no longer exists.
That person died,

00:41:35.167 --> 00:41:38.190
got married and the memories
died."

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:40.495
If we say that,
we have very,

00:41:40.495 --> 00:41:43.385
very short lives.
Because after all,

00:41:43.385 --> 00:41:47.362
right now I've got some
memories that I didn't have two

00:41:47.362 --> 00:41:51.713
hours ago.
I have some memories I didn't

00:41:51.713 --> 00:41:56.583
have 20 minutes ago.
If every time you got a new

00:41:56.583 --> 00:42:02.215
memory you had a new personality
and the personality theory said

00:42:02.215 --> 00:42:07.579
having the very same personality
was the key to survival,

00:42:07.579 --> 00:42:11.179
then none of us survive more
than a few seconds.

00:42:11.179 --> 00:42:16.412
Well, the answer presumably is
going to be that the best

00:42:16.412 --> 00:42:21.834
version of the personality
theory doesn't require item for

00:42:21.834 --> 00:42:25.450
item having the very same
beliefs,

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:32.152
memories, desires, and so forth.
But instead requires enough

00:42:32.152 --> 00:42:37.769
gradual overlap.
Your personality can change and

00:42:37.769 --> 00:42:41.881
evolve over time.
So here I am as a 10 year old

00:42:41.881 --> 00:42:44.011
child.
I've got certain desires,

00:42:44.011 --> 00:42:46.406
certain memories.
As the year goes by,

00:42:46.406 --> 00:42:50.659
I get some new memories.
I lose some of my goals.

00:42:50.659 --> 00:42:54.521
I no longer--When I was 10,
when I grew up I wanted to be a

00:42:54.521 --> 00:42:57.466
trash collector.
That was my first chosen

00:42:57.466 --> 00:43:00.331
profession.
At some point I gave up that

00:43:00.331 --> 00:43:02.355
desire.
I didn't want to be a trash

00:43:02.355 --> 00:43:04.333
collector anymore.
I wanted to be,

00:43:04.333 --> 00:43:07.129
I kid you not,
I wanted to be a logician when

00:43:07.129 --> 00:43:10.661
I was a teenager.
I wanted to study symbolic

00:43:10.661 --> 00:43:12.904
logic.
So at a certain point I gave

00:43:12.904 --> 00:43:15.036
that up.
So my memories,

00:43:15.036 --> 00:43:21.250
my desires were changing,
but they all changed gradually.

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:24.476
I lost some old memories.
I don't remember everything I

00:43:24.476 --> 00:43:26.090
knew or remembered when I was
10.

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:29.289
When I was 10,
I had pretty vivid memories of

00:43:29.289 --> 00:43:32.623
kindergarten.
Now I have very sketchy

00:43:32.623 --> 00:43:37.570
memories of kindergarten.
Still, it wasn't abrupt.

00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:41.231
It was gradual.
There was this slow evolution

00:43:41.231 --> 00:43:44.752
of the personality.
And so when the personality

00:43:44.752 --> 00:43:48.429
theorist says the key to
personal identity is the same

00:43:48.429 --> 00:43:52.006
personality,
they don't' mean literally the

00:43:52.006 --> 00:43:55.219
very same set of beliefs and
desires.

00:43:55.219 --> 00:43:59.277
They mean, rather,
the same slowly evolving

00:43:59.277 --> 00:44:00.630
personality.

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:08.820
Here's an analogy.
Suppose I had a rope that

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:16.849
stretched from that end of the
room all the way across to this

00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:23.090
end of the room.
Very same rope at that end as

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:25.460
this end.
What makes up a rope?

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:28.827
Well as you know,
ropes are basically bundles of

00:44:28.827 --> 00:44:32.983
fibers, very thin fibers that
have been woven together in a

00:44:32.983 --> 00:44:35.941
certain way.
But the interesting thing is

00:44:35.941 --> 00:44:39.369
the fibers themselves aren't
actually all that long.

00:44:39.369 --> 00:44:42.960
They might be a couple of
inches or at most a foot or so.

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:49.121
And so no single fiber
stretches all the way across the

00:44:49.121 --> 00:44:52.518
room.
Or even if some fibers did,

00:44:52.518 --> 00:44:56.194
most of the fibers don't.
Does that force us to say,

00:44:56.194 --> 00:44:58.677
"Ah, so it's not the very same
rope at the end as at the

00:44:58.677 --> 00:44:59.559
beginning"?
No.

00:44:59.559 --> 00:45:01.969
We don't have to say that at
all.

00:45:01.969 --> 00:45:06.268
What we want to say is,
"It's the same rope as long as

00:45:06.268 --> 00:45:10.000
there's this pattern of
overlapping fibers."

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.181
Certain fibers end,
but most of the fibers are

00:45:13.181 --> 00:45:15.870
continuing.
Some new fibers get introduced.

00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:19.101
They continue for a while.
Eventually maybe those fibers

00:45:19.101 --> 00:45:22.430
end, but some new fibers have
been introduced in the meantime.

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:27.775
As long as it's not abrupt.
Imagine I take my scissors and

00:45:27.775 --> 00:45:31.940
cut out a foot in the middle.
Then we'd say there isn't the

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:34.880
right kind of pattern of overlap
and continuity.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.610
Now we really do have two
ropes--one rope here,

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:39.922
one rope there.
But if, in contrast,

00:45:39.922 --> 00:45:43.048
there is the right kind of
pattern of overlap and

00:45:43.048 --> 00:45:46.075
continuity,
same rope, even though,

00:45:46.075 --> 00:45:50.949
even if no single fiber makes
it all the way across.

00:45:50.949 --> 00:45:56.150
Something analogous needs to be
said by the personality

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:59.704
theorist.
Even if I have few or no

00:45:59.704 --> 00:46:05.420
memories identical to the ones
that I had when I was 10,

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:09.843
that's okay.
We can still say it's the same

00:46:09.843 --> 00:46:15.666
personality, the same evolving
personality, so long as there's

00:46:15.666 --> 00:46:19.389
a pattern of overlap and
continuity.

00:46:19.389 --> 00:46:22.780
New memories get added,
some memories get lost.

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:26.119
New goals get added,
some goals get lost.

00:46:26.119 --> 00:46:29.130
New beliefs get added,
some beliefs get lost.

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:33.769
There might be few beliefs,
desires, goals that made it all

00:46:33.769 --> 00:46:36.871
the way through.
But as long as there's the

00:46:36.871 --> 00:46:40.450
right kind of overlap and
continuity, same personality.

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:45.418
All right, so what have we got?
Three views--soul view,

00:46:45.418 --> 00:46:50.865
body view, personality view.
Three rival theories about the

00:46:50.865 --> 00:46:56.409
key to personal identity.
Now, which of these is right?

00:46:56.409 --> 00:46:59.321
Well, I don't myself believe in
souls, it's hardly going to

00:46:59.321 --> 00:47:02.233
surprise you to learn that I
don't think the soul theory of

00:47:02.233 --> 00:47:06.370
personal identity is right.
For me, the choice boils down

00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:11.798
to the choice between the body
theory of personal identity and

00:47:11.798 --> 00:47:15.980
the personality theory of
personal identity.

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:19.199
Of course, in real life,
they go hand in hand.

00:47:19.199 --> 00:47:24.570
In ordinary cases at least,
same body, same personality.

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:27.349
Both theories are going to say
it's the very same person.

00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:29.798
And if you believe in souls,
you are likely to think,

00:47:29.798 --> 00:47:32.096
same soul as well.
In ordinary cases,

00:47:32.096 --> 00:47:35.939
you have the same soul,
same body, same personality,

00:47:35.939 --> 00:47:39.021
same person.
To think about which one of

00:47:39.021 --> 00:47:43.359
these is the key to personal
identity, we need to think about

00:47:43.359 --> 00:47:46.249
cases,
maybe somewhat fantastical,

00:47:46.249 --> 00:47:49.900
science-fictiony,
in which they come apart.

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:56.023
Cases in which bodies and
personalities go their own ways,

00:47:56.023 --> 00:48:00.420
as it were.
So that's what I'm going to do.

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:10.237
I'm going to tell you a story
in which your body ends up one

00:48:10.237 --> 00:48:18.889
place and your personality ends
up someplace else.

00:48:18.889 --> 00:48:24.777
And I'm going to invite you to
think about which of these two

00:48:24.777 --> 00:48:30.248
resulting end products is me.
If you could figure out which

00:48:30.248 --> 00:48:34.936
one's you, that would tell you
whether you think the body

00:48:34.936 --> 00:48:39.792
theory is the right theory or
the personality theory is the

00:48:39.792 --> 00:48:44.722
right theory.
Now, what's going to be our

00:48:44.722 --> 00:48:46.848
guide?
I'm going to,

00:48:46.848 --> 00:48:51.898
rather gruesomely--not in real
life, a science fiction

00:48:51.898 --> 00:48:57.519
story--I'm going to torture one
of the two end products.

00:48:57.519 --> 00:49:03.142
I'm going to ask you,
"Which one do you want to be

00:49:03.142 --> 00:49:06.822
tortured?"
Or to put the point more

00:49:06.822 --> 00:49:11.809
properly, which one do you want
to not be tortured?

00:49:11.809 --> 00:49:16.248
Because I'm going to assume,
I'm going to take it,

00:49:16.248 --> 00:49:21.139
that it's important to you that
you not be tortured.

00:49:21.139 --> 00:49:26.396
So by seeing who you want to
keep safe, this will help you

00:49:26.396 --> 00:49:29.440
see which one you think is you.

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:35.919
Of course, I've got to be sure
that you're thinking about this

00:49:35.919 --> 00:49:38.515
in the right way.
Like some of you are probably

00:49:38.515 --> 00:49:42.016
good, moral individuals and you
don't want anybody to be

00:49:42.016 --> 00:49:43.857
tortured.
I say, "Ah, I'm about to

00:49:43.857 --> 00:49:45.910
torture Linda over there."
You say, "No, no.

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:50.447
Don't torture Linda."
Still, if I were to say to you,

00:49:50.447 --> 00:49:53.100
"I'm about to torture you."
You'd say, "No, no!

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:56.162
Don't torture me!"
and there'd be some extra

00:49:56.162 --> 00:49:58.559
little something when you said
that, right?

00:49:58.559 --> 00:50:04.246
So I want to invite you to keep
that extra little something in

00:50:04.246 --> 00:50:08.621
mind when we tell the stories,
which we won't get to until

00:50:08.621 --> 00:50:10.940
next time, when we tell the
stories next time,

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:12.625
and I say,
"Okay, who do you want to be

00:50:12.625 --> 00:50:14.039
tortured, this person or that
person?"

00:50:14.039 --> 00:50:17.373
The question is,
from that special egoistic

00:50:17.373 --> 00:50:20.547
perspective that we're all
familiar with,

00:50:20.547 --> 00:50:23.960
which is the one you really
care about?

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:28.638
That's going to be our guide to
deciding what's the key to

00:50:28.638 --> 00:50:31.719
personal identity.
But to hear the stories,

00:50:31.719 --> 00:50:34.000
you've got to come back next
lecture.

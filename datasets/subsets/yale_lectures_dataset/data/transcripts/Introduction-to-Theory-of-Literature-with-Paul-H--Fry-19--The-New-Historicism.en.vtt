00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.777
Prof: So today we turn
to a mode of doing literary

00:00:06.777 --> 00:00:10.897
criticism which was
extraordinarily widespread

00:00:10.897 --> 00:00:16.300
beginning in the late seventies
and into the eighties,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.260
called the New Historicism.
 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.548
It was definable in ways that
I'll turn to in a minute and,

00:00:25.548 --> 00:00:31.620
as I say, prevalent to a
remarkable degree everywhere.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.420
It began probably at the
University of California at

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.123
Berkeley under the auspices,
in part, of Stephen Greenblatt,

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:43.290
whose brief essay you've read
for today.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.760
Greenblatt and others founded a
journal,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.445
still one of the most important
and influential journals in the

00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:52.590
field of literary study,
called

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.990
Representations--always
has been and still is an organ

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.780
for New Historicist thought.
 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.721
It's a movement which began
primarily preoccupied with the

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:07.003
Early Modern period,
the so-called

00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:08.938
"Renaissance."
 

00:01:08.938 --> 00:01:12.355
The New Historicism is,
in effect, responsible for the

00:01:12.355 --> 00:01:15.319
replacement of the term
"Renaissance"

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:18.090
with the term "Early
Modern."

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.424
Its influence,
however, quickly did extend to

00:01:21.424 --> 00:01:24.605
other fields,
some fields perhaps more than

00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:25.438
others.
 

00:01:25.438 --> 00:01:27.634
It would be,
I think, probably worth a

00:01:27.634 --> 00:01:30.955
lecture that I'm not going to
give to explain why certain

00:01:30.955 --> 00:01:34.572
fields somehow or another seem
to lend themselves more readily

00:01:34.572 --> 00:01:37.420
to New Historicist approaches
than others.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.950
I think it's fair to say that
in addition to the early modern

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.650
period,
the three fields that have been

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.462
most influenced by the New
Historicism are the eighteenth

00:01:47.462 --> 00:01:50.669
century,
British Romanticism,

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:57.480
and Americanist studies from
the late colonial through the

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.989
republican period.
 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:02.280
That age--the emergence of
print culture,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.640
the emergence of the public
sphere as a medium of influence,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.468
and the distribution of
knowledge in the United States--

00:02:11.468 --> 00:02:15.689
has been very fruitfully
studied from New Historicist

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.068
points of view.
 

00:02:17.068 --> 00:02:21.066
So those are the fields that
are most directly influenced by

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:22.150
this approach.
 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.849
When we discuss Jerome McGann's
essay, you'll see how it

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.960
influences Romantic studies.
 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.527
Now the New Historicism
was--and this probably accounts

00:02:35.527 --> 00:02:40.264
for its remarkable popularity
and influence in the period

00:02:40.264 --> 00:02:45.680
roughly from the late seventies
through the early nineties--

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:53.768
was a response to an increasing
sense of ethical failure in the

00:02:53.768 --> 00:03:01.727
isolation of the text as it was
allegedly practiced in certain

00:03:01.727 --> 00:03:05.378
forms of literary study.
 

00:03:05.378 --> 00:03:09.544
Beginning with the New
Criticism through the period of

00:03:09.544 --> 00:03:13.507
deconstruction,
and the recondite discourse of

00:03:13.507 --> 00:03:16.650
Lacan and others in
psychoanalysis,

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.250
there was a feeling widespread
among scholars,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.598
especially younger scholars,
that somehow or another,

00:03:24.598 --> 00:03:30.610
especially in response to
pressing concerns--

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.830
post-Vietnam,
concerns with globalization,

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:40.669
concerns with the distribution
of power and global capital--

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:46.175
all of these concerns inspired
what one can only call a guilt

00:03:46.175 --> 00:03:50.949
complex in academic literary
scholarship and led to a

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:54.068
"return to history."
 

00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:59.057
It was felt that a kind of
ethical tipping point had been

00:03:59.057 --> 00:04:03.867
arrived at and that the modes of
analysis that had been

00:04:03.867 --> 00:04:08.766
flourishing needed to be
superseded by modes of analysis

00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:13.576
in which history and the
political implications of what

00:04:13.576 --> 00:04:18.120
one was doing became prominent
and central.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.968
I have to say that in debates
of this kind there's always a

00:04:22.968 --> 00:04:27.649
considerable amount of hot air,
perhaps on both sides.

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:32.553
In many ways it's not the case
that the so-called isolated

00:04:32.553 --> 00:04:35.480
approaches really were isolated.
 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.767
Deconstruction in its second
generation wrote perpetually

00:04:39.767 --> 00:04:43.904
about history and undertook to
orient the techniques of

00:04:43.904 --> 00:04:47.810
deconstruction to an
understanding of history,

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.389
just to give one example.
 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.759
The New Historicism,
on the other hand,

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:58.440
evinced a preoccupation with
issues of form and textual

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.470
integrity that certainly
followed from the disciplines,

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.329
the approaches,
that preceded them.

00:05:06.329 --> 00:05:08.740
Also to a large degree--and
this is,

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.694
of course, true of a good many
other approaches that we're

00:05:12.694 --> 00:05:16.401
about to investigate,
approaches based in questions

00:05:16.401 --> 00:05:19.105
of identity also--
to a large degree,

00:05:19.105 --> 00:05:22.822
appropriated the language of
the generation of the

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:26.240
deconstructionists and,
to a certain extent,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.670
certain underlying
structuralist ideas having to do

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.509
with the binary relationship
between self and other,

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:37.959
and binary relationships among
social entities,

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:41.129
as opposed to linguistic
entities;

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:45.086
but still, as I say,
essentially inheriting the

00:05:45.086 --> 00:05:49.129
structure of thought of
preceding approaches.

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:52.923
So, as I say,
it was in a polemical

00:05:52.923 --> 00:05:59.286
atmosphere and at a moment of
widespread self-doubt in the

00:05:59.286 --> 00:06:05.646
academic literary profession
that the New Historicism came

00:06:05.646 --> 00:06:09.821
into its own--
a response, as I say,

00:06:09.821 --> 00:06:14.721
to the isolation of the text by
certain techniques and

00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:16.569
approaches to it.
 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:21.168
Now very quickly:
the method of New Historical

00:06:21.168 --> 00:06:26.190
analysis fell into a pattern,
a very engaging one,

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.218
one that's wonderfully
exemplified by the brief

00:06:30.218 --> 00:06:35.122
introduction of Greenblatt that
I have asked you to read:

00:06:35.122 --> 00:06:39.149
a pattern of beginning with an
anecdote,

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:43.723
often rather far afield,
at least apparently rather far

00:06:43.723 --> 00:06:46.473
afield,
from the literary issues that

00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:50.350
are eventually turned to in the
argument of a given essay.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.882
For example:
a dusty miller was walking down

00:06:52.882 --> 00:06:55.274
the road,
thinking about nothing in

00:06:55.274 --> 00:06:58.670
particular,
when he encountered a bailiff,

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.528
then certain legal issues
arise,

00:07:01.528 --> 00:07:05.547
and somehow or another the next
thing you know we're talking

00:07:05.547 --> 00:07:07.250
about King Lear.
 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:12.300
This rather marvelous,
oblique way into literary

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.779
topics was owing to the
brilliance in handling it of

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:20.245
Greenblatt,
in particular,

00:07:20.245 --> 00:07:22.750
and Louis Montrose and some of
his colleagues.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.524
This technique became a kind of
a hallmark of the New

00:07:27.524 --> 00:07:28.810
Historicism.
 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.387
In the long run,
of course, it was easy enough

00:07:32.387 --> 00:07:33.579
to parody it.
 

00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:38.774
It has been subjected to parody
and, in a certain sense,

00:07:38.774 --> 00:07:44.629
has been modified and chastened
by the prevalence of parody;

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:48.908
but it nevertheless,
I think, shows you something

00:07:48.908 --> 00:07:53.100
about the way New Historicist
thinking works.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.906
The New Historicism is
interested, following

00:07:55.906 --> 00:07:59.625
Foucault--and Foucault is the
primary influence on the New

00:07:59.625 --> 00:08:00.670
Historicism.
 

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:05.387
I won't say as much about this
today as I might feel obliged to

00:08:05.387 --> 00:08:09.800
say if I weren't soon be going
to return to Foucault in the

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.134
context of gender studies,
when we take up Foucault and

00:08:14.134 --> 00:08:18.093
Judith Butler together--
but I will say briefly that

00:08:18.093 --> 00:08:21.925
Foucault's writing,
especially his later writing,

00:08:21.925 --> 00:08:27.357
is about the pervasiveness,
the circulation through social

00:08:27.357 --> 00:08:29.702
orders,
of what he calls

00:08:29.702 --> 00:08:31.310
"power."
 

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.389
Now power is not just--or,
in many cases in Foucault,

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:39.918
not even primarily-- the power
of vested authorities,

00:08:39.918 --> 00:08:45.402
the power of violence,
or the power of tyranny from

00:08:45.402 --> 00:08:46.279
above.
 

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:49.715
Power in Foucault--though it
can be those things and

00:08:49.715 --> 00:08:53.399
frequently is--
is much more pervasively and

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:58.659
also insidiously the way in
which knowledge circulates in a

00:08:58.659 --> 00:09:03.644
culture: that is to say,
the way in which what we think,

00:09:03.644 --> 00:09:07.428
what we think that it is
appropriate to think--

00:09:07.428 --> 00:09:13.809
acceptable thinking--is
distributed by largely unseen

00:09:13.809 --> 00:09:19.700
forces in a social network or a
social system.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.312
Power, in other words,
in Foucault is in a certain

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:25.715
sense knowledge,
or to put it another way,

00:09:25.715 --> 00:09:30.471
it is the explanation of how
certain forms of knowledge come

00:09:30.471 --> 00:09:32.850
to exist--
knowledge, by the way,

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.389
not necessarily of something
that's true.

00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:40.269
Certain forms of knowledge come
to exist in certain places.

00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:45.190
So all of this is central to
the work of Foucault and is

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.678
carried over by the New
Historicists;

00:09:48.678 --> 00:09:51.850
hence the interest for them of
the anecdotes.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:56.481
Start as far afield as you can
imaginably start from what you

00:09:56.481 --> 00:10:01.095
will finally be talking about,
which is probably some textual

00:10:01.095 --> 00:10:05.432
or thematic issue in Shakespeare
or in the Elizabethan masque or

00:10:05.432 --> 00:10:07.360
whatever the case may be.
 

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.408
Start as far afield as you
possibly can from that,

00:10:11.408 --> 00:10:17.942
precisely in order to show the
pervasiveness of a certain kind

00:10:17.942 --> 00:10:23.067
of thinking,
the pervasiveness of a certain

00:10:23.067 --> 00:10:28.230
social constraint or limitation
on freedom.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.038
If you can show how pervasive
it is,

00:10:31.038 --> 00:10:37.350
you reinforce and justify the
Foucauldian idea that power is,

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.904
as I've said,
an insidious and ubiquitous

00:10:41.904 --> 00:10:45.548
mode of circulating knowledge.
 

00:10:45.548 --> 00:10:49.514
All of this is implicit,
sometimes explicit,

00:10:49.514 --> 00:10:53.940
in New Historicist approaches
to what they do.

00:10:57.519 --> 00:11:01.760
So as I said,
Foucault is the crucial

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:07.451
antecedent and of course,
when it's a question of

00:11:07.451 --> 00:11:12.860
Foucault, literature as we want
to conceive of it--

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:17.519
perhaps generically or as a
particular kind of utterance as

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:22.931
opposed to other kinds--
does tend to collapse back into

00:11:22.931 --> 00:11:28.288
the broader or more general
notion of discourse,

00:11:28.288 --> 00:11:34.085
because it's by means of
discourse that power circulates

00:11:34.085 --> 00:11:35.350
knowledge.
 

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:40.355
Once again, despite the fact
that New Historicism wants to

00:11:40.355 --> 00:11:45.114
return us to the real world,
it nevertheless acknowledges

00:11:45.114 --> 00:11:47.730
that that return is language
bound.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:53.950
It is by means of language that
the real world shapes itself.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:57.620
That's why for the New
Historicist--

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.585
and by this means,
I'll turn in a moment to the

00:12:00.585 --> 00:12:04.195
marvelous anecdote with which
Greenblatt begins the brief

00:12:04.195 --> 00:12:06.710
essay that I've asked you to
read--

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:11.482
that's why the New Historicist
lays such intense emphasis on

00:12:11.482 --> 00:12:15.690
the idea that the relationship
between discourse--

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:20.759
call it literature if you like,
you might as well--

00:12:20.759 --> 00:12:23.509
and history is reciprocal.
 

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:29.359
Yes, history conditions what
literature can say in a given

00:12:29.359 --> 00:12:30.178
epoch.
 

00:12:30.178 --> 00:12:35.065
History is an important way of
understanding the valency of

00:12:35.065 --> 00:12:38.940
certain kinds of utterance at
certain times.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.125
In other words,
history is--as it's

00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:44.600
traditionally thought to be by
the Old Historicism,

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.216
and I'll get to that in a
minute--history is a background

00:12:48.216 --> 00:12:50.090
to discourse or literature.
 

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:57.400
But by the same token there is
an agency, that is to say a

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:04.970
capacity, to circulate power in
discourse in turn.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:09.054
Call it "literature":
"I am Richard II,

00:13:09.054 --> 00:13:11.058
know you not that?"
 

00:13:11.058 --> 00:13:15.758
says Queen Elizabeth when at
the time of the threatened Essex

00:13:15.758 --> 00:13:19.830
Uprising she gets wind of the
fact that Shakespeare's

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:23.120
Richard II is being
performed,

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.466
as she believes,
in the public streets and in

00:13:26.466 --> 00:13:27.759
private houses.
 

00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:30.110
In other words,
wherever there is sedition,

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:34.758
wherever there are people who
want to overthrow her and

00:13:34.758 --> 00:13:38.029
replace her with the Earl of
Essex,

00:13:38.029 --> 00:13:42.538
the pretender to the throne,
Richard II is being

00:13:42.538 --> 00:13:43.538
performed.
 

00:13:43.538 --> 00:13:46.793
Well, now this is terrifying to
Queen Elizabeth because she

00:13:46.793 --> 00:13:49.148
knows--
she's a supporter of the

00:13:49.148 --> 00:13:53.077
theater--she knows that
Richard II is about a

00:13:53.077 --> 00:13:57.158
king who has many virtues but a
certain weakness,

00:13:57.158 --> 00:14:00.590
a political weakness and also a
weakness of temperament--

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:04.594
the kind of weakness that makes
him sit upon the ground and tell

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:07.009
sad tales about the death of
kings,

00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:11.783
that kind of weakness,
who is then usurped by

00:14:11.783 --> 00:14:19.605
Bolingbroke who became Henry IV,
introducing a whole new dynasty

00:14:19.605 --> 00:14:25.058
and focus of the royal family in
England.

00:14:25.058 --> 00:14:29.817
Queen Elizabeth says,
"They're staging this play

00:14:29.817 --> 00:14:34.759
because they're trying to
compare me with Richard II in

00:14:34.759 --> 00:14:40.792
preparation for deposing me,
and who knows what else they

00:14:40.792 --> 00:14:43.158
might do to me?"
 

00:14:43.158 --> 00:14:45.210
This is a matter of great
concern.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.772
In other words,
literature--Fredric Jameson

00:14:47.772 --> 00:14:50.701
says "history
hurts"--literature hurts,

00:14:50.701 --> 00:14:51.190
too.
 

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:51.990
&gt;
 

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:56.071
Literature, in other words,
has a discursive agency that

00:14:56.071 --> 00:14:59.855
affects history every bit as
much as history affects

00:14:59.855 --> 00:15:04.528
literature: literature "out
there," and theater--

00:15:04.528 --> 00:15:07.701
especially if it escapes the
confines of the playhouse

00:15:07.701 --> 00:15:10.211
because,
as Greenblatt argues,

00:15:10.211 --> 00:15:15.239
the playhouse has a certain
mediatory effect which defuses

00:15:15.239 --> 00:15:18.149
the possibilities of sedition.
 

00:15:18.149 --> 00:15:22.163
One views literary
representation in the playhouse

00:15:22.163 --> 00:15:26.831
with a certain objectivity,
perhaps, that is absent

00:15:26.831 --> 00:15:32.120
altogether when interested
parties take up the same text

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:38.370
and stage it precisely for the
purpose of fomenting rebellion.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:43.714
Literature, especially when
escaped from its conventional

00:15:43.714 --> 00:15:46.345
confines,
becomes a very,

00:15:46.345 --> 00:15:50.899
very dangerous or
positive influence,

00:15:50.899 --> 00:15:53.918
depending on your point of view
on the course of history.

00:15:53.918 --> 00:16:00.086
So the relationship between
history and discourse is

00:16:00.086 --> 00:16:01.658
reciprocal.
 

00:16:01.658 --> 00:16:06.932
Greenblatt wants to argue with
a tremendous amount of stress

00:16:06.932 --> 00:16:10.418
and, I think,
effectiveness that the New

00:16:10.418 --> 00:16:14.798
Historicism differs from the Old
Historicism.

00:16:14.798 --> 00:16:18.950
This is on page 1443 in the
right-hand column.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.101
John Dover Wilson,
a traditional Shakespeare

00:16:22.101 --> 00:16:26.134
scholar and a very important
one, is the spokesperson in

00:16:26.134 --> 00:16:29.798
Greenblatt's scenario for the
Old Historicism.

00:16:29.798 --> 00:16:35.121
The view I'm about to quote is
that of John Dover Wilson,

00:16:35.121 --> 00:16:40.823
a kind of consensus about the
relationship between literature

00:16:40.823 --> 00:16:44.254
and history:
Modern historical scholarship

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:47.134
[meaning Old Historicism]
has assured Elizabeth

00:16:47.134 --> 00:16:48.700
&gt;
 

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:52.168
that she had [this is the
right-hand column about two

00:16:52.168 --> 00:16:55.370
thirds of the way down]
&gt;

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:59.322
nothing to worry about:
Richard II is not at all

00:16:59.322 --> 00:17:02.690
subversive but rather a hymn to
Tudor order.

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:06.598
The play, far from encouraging
thoughts of rebellion,

00:17:06.598 --> 00:17:09.692
regards the deposition of the
legitimate king as a

00:17:09.692 --> 00:17:13.163
"sacrilegious"
act that drags the country down

00:17:13.163 --> 00:17:15.690
into "the abyss of
chaos";

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:19.618
"that Shakespeare and his
audience regarded Bolingbroke as

00:17:19.618 --> 00:17:21.330
a usurper,"
declares J.

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:24.308
Dover Wilson,
"is incontestable."

00:17:24.308 --> 00:17:29.667
But in 1601 neither Queen
Elizabeth nor the Earl of Essex

00:17:29.667 --> 00:17:33.200
were so sureâ€¦
Greenblatt wins.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.630
It's a wonderful example.
 

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:38.595
It's the genius of Greenblatt
to choose examples that are so

00:17:38.595 --> 00:17:40.880
telling and so incontrovertible.
 

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.338
We know Queen Elizabeth was
scared &gt;

00:17:43.338 --> 00:17:46.327
on this occasion,
which makes it quite simply the

00:17:46.327 --> 00:17:50.248
case that John Dover Wilson was
wrong to suppose that Richard

00:17:50.248 --> 00:17:52.240
II was no threat to her.
 

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:57.724
It's not at all the point that
a broad, ideological view of

00:17:57.724 --> 00:18:03.400
Richard II was any
different from what Wilson said;

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.180
that was perfectly true.
 

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.400
Bolingbroke was
considered a usurper.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.338
It was considered tragic that
Richard II was deposed;

00:18:11.338 --> 00:18:15.482
but that doesn't mean that the
text can't be taken over,

00:18:15.482 --> 00:18:18.118
commandeered and made
subversive.

00:18:18.118 --> 00:18:21.790
Wilson doesn't acknowledge this
because his view of the

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:26.074
relationship between history and
literature is only that history

00:18:26.074 --> 00:18:29.500
influences literature,
not that the influence can be

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.160
reciprocal.
 

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:34.507
You see, that's how it is that
the New Historicism wants to

00:18:34.507 --> 00:18:38.480
define itself over and against
the Old Historicism.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:45.519
If there is a political or
ideological consensus about the

00:18:45.519 --> 00:18:50.046
legitimacy of monarchy,
the divine right of kings,

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:53.085
the legitimacy of succession
under the sanction of the Church

00:18:53.085 --> 00:18:55.009
of England and all the rest of
it--

00:18:55.009 --> 00:18:58.387
all of which is anachronistic
when you're thinking about these

00:18:58.387 --> 00:19:01.267
history plays--
if there is this broad

00:19:01.267 --> 00:19:05.823
consensus, that's it,
that's what the play

00:19:05.823 --> 00:19:08.730
means according to the Old
Historicism,

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:12.625
even though plainly you can
take the plot of the play and

00:19:12.625 --> 00:19:17.522
completely invert those values,
which is what the Essex faction

00:19:17.522 --> 00:19:22.019
does in staging it in those
places where Queen Elizabeth

00:19:22.019 --> 00:19:24.880
suspects that it's being staged.
 

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.798
Okay.
 

00:19:25.798 --> 00:19:29.507
Now another way in which the
Old Historicism and the New

00:19:29.507 --> 00:19:32.801
Historicism differ--
correctly, I think-- according

00:19:32.801 --> 00:19:36.124
to Greenblatt is that in the Old
Historicism there is no

00:19:36.124 --> 00:19:38.674
question--
I'm looking at page 1444,

00:19:38.674 --> 00:19:42.490
the right-hand column about a
third of the way down--

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:52.509
of the role of the historian's
own subjectivity.

00:19:52.509 --> 00:19:55.568
"It is not thought,"
says Greenblatt,

00:19:55.568 --> 00:19:57.683
"to be the product of the
historian's

00:19:57.683 --> 00:20:00.519
interpretationâ€¦"
History is just what is.

00:20:00.519 --> 00:20:03.608
One views it objectively and
that's that.

00:20:03.608 --> 00:20:08.078
Now notice here that we're back
with Gadamer.

00:20:08.078 --> 00:20:12.265
Remember that this was
Gadamer's accusation of

00:20:12.265 --> 00:20:16.622
historicism,
the belief of historicism--what

00:20:16.622 --> 00:20:20.348
Greenblatt calls the Old
Historicism--

00:20:20.348 --> 00:20:26.034
that we can bracket out our own
historical horizon and that we

00:20:26.034 --> 00:20:31.438
can eliminate all of our own
historical prejudices in order

00:20:31.438 --> 00:20:36.750
to understand the past
objectively in and for itself.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:39.000
This is not the case,
said Gadamer,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.730
remember.
 

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:43.855
Gadamer said that
interpretation must necessarily

00:20:43.855 --> 00:20:49.185
involve the merger of horizons,
the horizon of the other and my

00:20:49.185 --> 00:20:52.108
own horizon as an interpreter.
 

00:20:52.108 --> 00:20:56.509
I cannot bracket out my own
subjectivity.

00:20:56.509 --> 00:20:57.690
Okay.
 

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.846
If that's the case,
then Gadamer anticipates

00:21:00.846 --> 00:21:04.371
Greenblatt in saying that the
naïveté

00:21:04.371 --> 00:21:08.409
of the Old Historicism is its
supposition that it has no

00:21:08.409 --> 00:21:12.078
vested interest in what it's
talking about--

00:21:12.078 --> 00:21:15.319
that is to say,
its supposition that it wants

00:21:15.319 --> 00:21:19.076
history to accord in one way or
another with its own

00:21:19.076 --> 00:21:22.410
preconceptions,
but isn't aware of it.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:26.480
The anecdote--again,
wonderfully placed in the

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.675
polemical argument--
that after all,

00:21:29.675 --> 00:21:34.339
John Dover Wilson delivered
himself of these opinions about

00:21:34.339 --> 00:21:39.326
Richard II before a group
of scholars in Germany in 1939

00:21:39.326 --> 00:21:42.170
is,
after all, rather interesting.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:45.900
Hitler is about to be the
Bolingbroke of Germany.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.251
John Dover Wilson wants his
audience to say,

00:21:48.251 --> 00:21:49.730
"Hey, wait a minute.
 

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.859
Stick with vested authority.
 

00:21:51.859 --> 00:21:52.940
&gt;
 

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.460
You have a weak democracy,
but it is a democracy.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.288
Don't let it get away from
you."

00:21:58.288 --> 00:22:02.480
And so he is speaking,
the horse already having

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:07.242
escaped from the barn,
in this reassuring way about

00:22:07.242 --> 00:22:12.653
German politics as a means of
sort of reinforcing his own view

00:22:12.653 --> 00:22:16.380
of the politics of Elizabethan
England.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:20.856
But this, Greenblatt supposes,
is something about which he has

00:22:20.856 --> 00:22:23.278
very little self-consciousness.
 

00:22:23.278 --> 00:22:26.068
That is to say,
his own interest,

00:22:26.068 --> 00:22:30.078
as of course it should be on
this occasion,

00:22:30.078 --> 00:22:33.338
is in the preservation of
vested authority,

00:22:33.338 --> 00:22:38.743
and his own interest then folds
back into his understanding of

00:22:38.743 --> 00:22:44.147
Elizabethan ideology in such a
way that it can conform to that

00:22:44.147 --> 00:22:45.298
interest.
 

00:22:45.298 --> 00:22:49.970
He has, in other words,
as we say today,

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:54.730
a hidden agenda and is very
little aware of it,

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:59.108
unlike the New Historicist who,
following Gadamer in this

00:22:59.108 --> 00:23:02.520
respect,
is fully cognizant of the

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:08.441
subjective investment that leads
to a choice of interest in

00:23:08.441 --> 00:23:11.574
materials,
a way of thinking about those

00:23:11.574 --> 00:23:15.394
materials,
and a means of bringing them to

00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:18.808
life for us today and into
focus.

00:23:18.808 --> 00:23:21.805
In other words,
it's okay for Greenblatt,

00:23:21.805 --> 00:23:25.250
as it was for Gadamer--much to
the horror of E.

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:25.700
D.
 

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.917
Hirsch--to find the
significance of a text,

00:23:28.917 --> 00:23:31.828
as opposed to the meaning of a
text.

00:23:31.828 --> 00:23:36.980
The significance of the text is
that it has certain kinds of

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.990
power invested in it.
 

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:43.314
Those kinds of power are still
of interest to us today,

00:23:43.314 --> 00:23:47.880
still of relevance to what's
going on in our own world.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.784
All of this is taken up openly
as a matter of

00:23:51.784 --> 00:23:57.019
self-consciousness by the New
Historicists in ways that,

00:23:57.019 --> 00:24:00.278
according to Greenblatt and his
colleagues,

00:24:00.278 --> 00:24:06.160
were not available consciously
in the older Historicism.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:10.769
Now the world as the New
Historicism sees it--

00:24:10.769 --> 00:24:16.380
and after I've said this,
I'll turn to McGann--

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:23.210
is essentially a dynamic
interplay of power,

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:25.848
networks of power,
and subversion:

00:24:25.848 --> 00:24:29.746
that is to say,
modes of challenging those

00:24:29.746 --> 00:24:34.280
networks even within the
authoritative texts that

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.210
generate positions of power.
 

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:40.220
The Elizabethan masque,
for example,

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:46.430
which stages the relation of
court to courtier,

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:53.420
to visitor, to hanger-on in
wonderfully orchestrated ways,

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:58.348
is a means--because it's kind
of poly-vocal--

00:24:58.348 --> 00:25:04.047
of containing within its
structure elements of

00:25:04.047 --> 00:25:07.467
subversion,
according to the argument

00:25:07.467 --> 00:25:11.223
that's made about these things:
the same with court ritual

00:25:11.223 --> 00:25:14.625
itself,
the same with the happenstance

00:25:14.625 --> 00:25:19.528
that takes place once a year in
early modern England,

00:25:19.528 --> 00:25:26.010
in which the Lord of Misrule is
so denominated and ordinary

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:31.038
authority is turned on its ear
for one day.

00:25:31.038 --> 00:25:34.577
Queen for a day,
as it were, is something that

00:25:34.577 --> 00:25:37.880
is available to any citizen once
a year.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:42.150
These are all ways of defusing
what they,

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:45.950
in fact, bring into visibility
and consciousness--

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:48.998
mainly the existence,
perhaps the inevitable

00:25:48.998 --> 00:25:52.838
existence,
of subversion with respect to

00:25:52.838 --> 00:25:57.368
structures and circulatory
systems of power.

00:25:57.368 --> 00:26:01.515
It's this relationship between
power and subversion that the

00:26:01.515 --> 00:26:05.137
New Historicism,
especially in taking up issues

00:26:05.137 --> 00:26:10.567
of the Early Modern period,
tends to focus on and to

00:26:10.567 --> 00:26:12.578
specialize in.
 

00:26:12.578 --> 00:26:18.952
Now it's not wholly clear that
Jerome McGann has ever really

00:26:18.952 --> 00:26:23.490
thought of himself as a New
Historicist.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:25.980
He has been so designated by
others,

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.874
but I think there is one rather
important difference in

00:26:29.874 --> 00:26:32.710
emphasis,
at least between what he's

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:37.181
doing and what Greenblatt and
his colleagues do in the Early

00:26:37.181 --> 00:26:38.470
Modern period.
 

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:43.079
McGann doesn't really so much
stress the reciprocity of

00:26:43.079 --> 00:26:45.130
history and discourse.
 

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:49.636
He is interested in the
presence of history,

00:26:49.636 --> 00:26:54.771
the presence of immediate
social and also personal

00:26:54.771 --> 00:26:59.279
circumstances in the history of
a text.

00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:04.071
His primary concern is with--at
least in this essay--textual

00:27:04.071 --> 00:27:05.210
scholarship.
 

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:10.608
He himself is the editor of the
new standard works of Byron.

00:27:10.608 --> 00:27:14.308
He has also done a standard
works of Swinburne,

00:27:14.308 --> 00:27:18.590
and he has been a vocal and
colorful spokesperson of a

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:23.438
certain point of view within the
recondite debates of textual

00:27:23.438 --> 00:27:28.123
scholarship: whether textual
scholarship ought to produce a

00:27:28.123 --> 00:27:32.888
text that's an amalgam of a
variety of available manuscripts

00:27:32.888 --> 00:27:36.807
and printed texts;
whether the text it produces

00:27:36.807 --> 00:27:40.380
ought to be the last and best
thoughts of the author--

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:44.085
that's the position that McGann
seems to be taking in this

00:27:44.085 --> 00:27:45.827
essay--
or whether the text,

00:27:45.827 --> 00:27:49.085
on the contrary,
ought to be the first burst of

00:27:49.085 --> 00:27:51.078
inspiration of the author.
 

00:27:51.078 --> 00:27:53.981
All the people who prefer the
earliest versions of

00:27:53.981 --> 00:27:56.351
Wordsworth's Prelude,
for example,

00:27:56.351 --> 00:27:58.720
would favor that last point of
view.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.435
In other words,
McGann is making a contribution

00:28:02.435 --> 00:28:06.961
here not least to the debates
surrounding editing and the

00:28:06.961 --> 00:28:10.838
production of authoritative
scholarly texts.

00:28:10.838 --> 00:28:15.338
It's in that context that the
remarks he's making about Keats

00:28:15.338 --> 00:28:17.140
have to be understood.
 

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:21.265
I think the primary influence
on McGann is not so much

00:28:21.265 --> 00:28:24.863
Foucault,
then, with the sense of the

00:28:24.863 --> 00:28:30.190
circulation of power back and
forth between history and

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:34.027
literary discourse,
as it is Bakhtin,

00:28:34.027 --> 00:28:38.358
whom he quotes on pages
eighteen and nineteen;

00:28:38.358 --> 00:28:41.220
or whose influence he cites,
I should say rather,

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.971
in a way that,
I think, does pervade what you

00:28:43.971 --> 00:28:47.348
encounter in reading what he
then goes on to say at the

00:28:47.348 --> 00:28:50.788
bottom of page eighteen in the
copy center reader:

00:28:50.788 --> 00:28:54.884
What follows [says McGann]
is a summary and extrapolation

00:28:54.884 --> 00:28:59.344
of certain key ideas set forth
by the so-called Bakhtin School

00:28:59.344 --> 00:29:02.214
of criticism,
a small group of Marxist

00:29:02.214 --> 00:29:05.973
critics from the Soviet Union
who made an early attack upon

00:29:05.973 --> 00:29:09.019
formalist approaches to poetry
[just as he,

00:29:09.019 --> 00:29:12.529
McGann, is, and as the New
Historicists are themselves,

00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:14.509
in their turn, doing].
 

00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:17.711
The Bakhtin School's
socio-historical method

00:29:17.711 --> 00:29:20.538
approaches all language
utterances--

00:29:20.538 --> 00:29:24.674
including poems--as phenomena
marked with their concrete

00:29:24.674 --> 00:29:26.328
origins and history.
 

00:29:26.328 --> 00:29:30.094
That is to say,
phenomena voiced by the

00:29:30.094 --> 00:29:35.740
material circumstances that
produce them or phenomena,

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:39.547
in other words,
in which the voice of the

00:29:39.547 --> 00:29:45.640
Romantic solitary individual is
not really that voice at all,

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:50.731
but is rather the polyglossal
infusion of a variety of

00:29:50.731 --> 00:29:53.558
perspectives,
including ideological

00:29:53.558 --> 00:29:56.559
perspectives,
shaping that particular

00:29:56.559 --> 00:30:00.893
utterance and also,
in the case of the textual

00:30:00.893 --> 00:30:04.401
scholar,
shaping which of a variety of

00:30:04.401 --> 00:30:09.453
manuscripts will be chosen for
publication and for central

00:30:09.453 --> 00:30:15.038
attention in the tradition of
the reception of a given text.

00:30:15.038 --> 00:30:22.224
So all of this McGann takes to
be derived from Bakhtin rather

00:30:22.224 --> 00:30:24.740
than from Foucault.
 

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:28.160
I do think that's a significant
difference between our two

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:28.759
authors.
 

00:30:28.759 --> 00:30:34.325
Now McGann's most important
contribution to the return to

00:30:34.325 --> 00:30:40.188
history of the seventies and
eighties is a short book called

00:30:40.188 --> 00:30:44.688
The Romantic Ideology,
and this book--well,

00:30:44.688 --> 00:30:47.220
what it is is an attack on
Romanticism.

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.923
At least it's an attack on
certain widely understood and

00:30:50.923 --> 00:30:53.348
received ideas about
Romanticism--

00:30:53.348 --> 00:30:55.950
ideas with which,
by the way, I don't agree,

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:57.808
but this course isn't about me.
 

00:30:57.808 --> 00:31:03.160
The Romantic Ideology is
an amalgam of two titles.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:07.355
One of them is the important
early critique of Romanticism by

00:31:07.355 --> 00:31:11.412
the German poet and sometime
Romantic Heinrich Heine called

00:31:11.412 --> 00:31:16.326
Die romantische Schule,
or The Romantic School,

00:31:16.326 --> 00:31:20.220
in which the subjectivity,
even solipsism,

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:26.048
and the isolation from social
concern and from unfolding

00:31:26.048 --> 00:31:32.304
historical processes of the
Romantic poets is emphasized and

00:31:32.304 --> 00:31:34.000
criticized.
 

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.230
In addition to that--that's
where the word

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:38.951
"Romantic"
comes from in the title The

00:31:38.951 --> 00:31:42.005
Romantic Ideology--
the other title that it

00:31:42.005 --> 00:31:45.588
amalgamates is Marx's book
The German Ideology,

00:31:45.588 --> 00:31:49.259
which is about many things
but is in particular about

00:31:49.259 --> 00:31:52.667
Lumpenproletariat
intellectuals who think with

00:31:52.667 --> 00:31:55.304
Hegel--
still following Hegel despite

00:31:55.304 --> 00:31:58.009
believing themselves to be
progressive--

00:31:58.009 --> 00:32:01.057
who think with Hegel that
thought produces material

00:32:01.057 --> 00:32:03.863
circumstances rather than the
other way around:

00:32:03.863 --> 00:32:07.881
in other words people,
in short, who are idealists and

00:32:07.881 --> 00:32:10.845
therefore,
under this indictment,

00:32:10.845 --> 00:32:12.240
also Romantic.
 

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.924
McGann's title,
as I say, cleverly amalgamates

00:32:15.924 --> 00:32:21.328
these two other titles and sets
the agenda for this short book,

00:32:21.328 --> 00:32:25.903
which is an attack not just on
Romanticism but on what he

00:32:25.903 --> 00:32:29.825
believes to be our continued
tendency still to be

00:32:29.825 --> 00:32:32.440
"in"
Romanticism,

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.970
still to be Romantic.
 

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:38.853
There his particular object of
attack is the so-called Yale

00:32:38.853 --> 00:32:43.819
school, which is still under
attack in the essay that you've

00:32:43.819 --> 00:32:45.420
read for today.
 

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:49.577
Paul de Man and Geoffrey
Hartman's well-known essay on

00:32:49.577 --> 00:32:54.208
Keats's "To Autumn"
are singled out for particular

00:32:54.208 --> 00:32:59.981
scorn and dispraise,
all sort of on the grounds that

00:32:59.981 --> 00:33:02.169
yes,
it's all very well to read

00:33:02.169 --> 00:33:04.423
Romanticism,
to come to understand it,

00:33:04.423 --> 00:33:06.369
and even to be fascinated by
it;

00:33:06.369 --> 00:33:08.630
but we can't be Romantic.
 

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:10.558
In other words,
our reading of Romanticism--

00:33:10.558 --> 00:33:14.519
if we are to be social animals,
politically engaged,

00:33:14.519 --> 00:33:21.328
and invested in the world as a
social community--

00:33:21.328 --> 00:33:25.250
must necessarily be an
anti-Romantic critique.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.796
This is, as I say,
still essentially the position

00:33:27.796 --> 00:33:28.910
taken up by McGann.
 

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.146
All right.
 

00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:39.460
So I've explained the ways in
which he differs from Greenblatt

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:43.348
in leaning more toward Bakhtin
than toward Foucault.

00:33:43.348 --> 00:33:47.710
I have explained that McGann is
engaged primarily in talking

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:51.626
about issues of textual
scholarship in this particular

00:33:51.626 --> 00:33:54.554
essay,
that he defends Keats's last

00:33:54.554 --> 00:33:58.131
deliberate choices,
that he believes the so-called

00:33:58.131 --> 00:34:01.517
"indicator"
text of 1820 of "La Belle

00:34:01.517 --> 00:34:04.636
Dame Sans Merci"
is Keats's last deliberate

00:34:04.636 --> 00:34:08.059
choice,
as opposed to the 1848 text

00:34:08.059 --> 00:34:13.655
published by Monckton Milnes in
the edition of Keats's poems

00:34:13.655 --> 00:34:17.070
that he brought out at that
time.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:23.302
Now I think that in the time
remaining to sort of linger over

00:34:23.302 --> 00:34:29.641
McGann, I do want to say a few
things about what he says about

00:34:29.641 --> 00:34:30.679
Keats.
 

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:36.608
I want to emphasize that his
general pronouncements about the

00:34:36.608 --> 00:34:41.802
historicity of texts,
about the permeation of texts

00:34:41.802 --> 00:34:45.989
by the circumstances of their
production,

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:50.179
their conditioning by
ideological factors,

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:51.869
is unimpeachable.
 

00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:56.056
It seems to me that this is a
necessary approach at least to

00:34:56.056 --> 00:34:59.208
have in mind if not,
perhaps, necessarily to

00:34:59.208 --> 00:35:02.710
emphasize in one's own work of
literary scholarship.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:07.217
The idea that a text just falls
from a tree--if anybody ever had

00:35:07.217 --> 00:35:10.510
that idea, by the way
&gt;

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:16.561
--is plainly not a tenable one,
and the opposite idea that a

00:35:16.561 --> 00:35:22.510
text emerges from a complex
matrix of social and historical

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:26.820
circumstances is certainly a
good one.

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:30.570
So if one is to criticize,
again it's not a question of

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.280
criticizing his basic
pronouncements.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:37.320
It seems to me nothing could be
said really against them.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.750
The trouble is that in the case
of McGann--

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:44.641
who is a terrific,
prominent Romantic scholar with

00:35:44.641 --> 00:35:47.677
whom one,
I suppose, hesitates to

00:35:47.677 --> 00:35:52.393
disagree--everything he says
about the text that he isolates

00:35:52.393 --> 00:35:55.750
for attention in this essay is
simply,

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:57.320
consistently, wrong.
 

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:02.719
It's almost as if by compulsion
that he says things that are

00:36:02.719 --> 00:36:07.284
wrong about these texts,
and the reason I asked you in

00:36:07.284 --> 00:36:10.610
my e-mail last night to take a
look at them,

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:15.179
if you get a chance,
is so that these few remarks

00:36:15.179 --> 00:36:19.369
that I make now might have some
substance.

00:36:19.369 --> 00:36:22.190
Take for example "La Belle
Dame Sans Merci."

00:36:25.699 --> 00:36:30.190
In the first place,
who says we only read

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:31.719
the 1848 text?
 

00:36:31.719 --> 00:36:36.719
A scholarly edition--and his
main object of attack is Jack

00:36:36.719 --> 00:36:42.072
Stillinger's scholarly edition
of Keats--gives you basically a

00:36:42.072 --> 00:36:44.090
variorum apparatus.
 

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:47.936
Yeah, maybe it gives you a
particular text in bold print,

00:36:47.936 --> 00:36:51.646
but it gives you the variant
text in smaller print in a

00:36:51.646 --> 00:36:52.539
footnote.
 

00:36:52.539 --> 00:36:55.949
It doesn't withhold the variant
text from you.

00:36:55.949 --> 00:36:59.000
It says, "No,
look, there's this too.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.860
Take your choice."
 

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:04.786
Really the atmosphere of a
variorum scholarly edition is an

00:37:04.786 --> 00:37:09.333
atmosphere of take your choice,
not a kind of tyrannical

00:37:09.333 --> 00:37:15.130
imposition on the public of a
particular version of the text.

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:18.809
Everybody knows the 1820
Indicator text.

00:37:18.809 --> 00:37:20.739
"What can ail thee,
wretched wight?"

00:37:20.739 --> 00:37:23.530
is at least as familiar to me,
as a Romanticist,

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:26.559
as "What can ail thee,
knight at arms?"

00:37:26.559 --> 00:37:29.340
the way in which the 1848 text
begins;

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:33.039
and frankly how many people who
aren't Romanticists know

00:37:33.039 --> 00:37:34.989
anything about either text?
 

00:37:34.989 --> 00:37:37.150
What are we talking about here?
 

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:39.300
&gt;
 

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.900
The Romanticists know what's
going on.

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.114
They're not in any way
hornswoggled by this historical

00:37:45.114 --> 00:37:48.329
conspiracy against the 1820
indicator text,

00:37:48.329 --> 00:37:50.820
and people who aren't
Romanticists don't care.

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:55.409
That's what it comes down to;
but, if it's not enough simply

00:37:55.409 --> 00:37:59.204
to say that, turning to the
question of which text is

00:37:59.204 --> 00:38:02.344
better--well,
it's hard to say which text is

00:38:02.344 --> 00:38:03.219
better.
 

00:38:03.219 --> 00:38:07.007
McGann's argument is that the
1820 version is better because

00:38:07.007 --> 00:38:10.539
it's a poem about a guy and a
girl who sort of meet,

00:38:10.539 --> 00:38:14.000
and the next thing you know
they're having sex and that

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.730
doesn't turn out so well.
 

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:18.090
In other words,
it's about the real world.

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:19.579
These things happen.
 

00:38:19.579 --> 00:38:23.077
It's not a romance,
whereas the "What can ail

00:38:23.077 --> 00:38:25.219
thee, wretched knight?"
 

00:38:25.219 --> 00:38:29.619
in the 1848 version--and all of
its other variants,

00:38:29.619 --> 00:38:31.300
the "kisses four"
and so on--

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:37.510
the 1848 version is a kind of
unselfconscious--

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:42.309
in McGann's view--romance
subscribing to certain medieval

00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:46.699
ideas about women,
simultaneously putting them on

00:38:46.699 --> 00:38:50.355
a pedestal and fearing,
at the same time,

00:38:50.355 --> 00:38:55.016
that they're invested with a
kind of black magic which

00:38:55.016 --> 00:38:59.677
destroys the souls and
dissipates the sap of deserving

00:38:59.677 --> 00:39:03.547
young gentlemen:
all of this is ideologically

00:39:03.547 --> 00:39:06.945
programmed,
according to McGann,

00:39:06.945 --> 00:39:08.760
in the 1848 version.
 

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:09.730
Why?
 

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:12.849
Because Charles Brown behaved
despicably toward women,

00:39:12.849 --> 00:39:16.389
he didn't like Fanny Brawne,
and because Monckton Milnes,

00:39:16.389 --> 00:39:19.369
the actual editor of the 1848
edition,

00:39:19.369 --> 00:39:24.239
loved pornography and was a big
collector of erotica.

00:39:24.239 --> 00:39:31.903
So that's why the 1848 text
with its fear of and denigration

00:39:31.903 --> 00:39:38.920
of women, in contrast to the
1820 text, is inferior.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.670
Well, two things:
first of all,

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:46.989
who's to say the 1848 text
wasn't Keats's last thoughts?

00:39:46.989 --> 00:39:49.740
In other words,
yes, he was already ill when

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.940
the Indicator text was
published in 1820.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:56.360
It is pretty close to the end
of his ability to think clearly

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:59.722
about his own work and to worry
very much about the forms in

00:39:59.722 --> 00:40:03.599
which it was published,
but at the same time we don't

00:40:03.599 --> 00:40:07.530
know when Brown received his
version of the text.

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.931
We can't suppose,
as McGann more than half

00:40:09.931 --> 00:40:13.389
implies, that Brown just sort of
sat down and rewrote it.

00:40:13.389 --> 00:40:14.579
&gt;
 

00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:18.463
Nobody has ever really said
that, and if he didn't rewrite

00:40:18.463 --> 00:40:22.280
it, then Keats must have given
it to him in that form.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:25.510
Who's to say that wasn't his
last and best thoughts?

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:28.284
Who's to say Keats didn't
really want to write a poem of

00:40:28.284 --> 00:40:28.889
this kind?
 

00:40:28.889 --> 00:40:33.806
After all, the title,
taken from a medieval ballad by

00:40:33.806 --> 00:40:37.722
Alain Chartier,
"La Belle Dame Sans

00:40:37.722 --> 00:40:42.610
Merci," bears out the
"What can ail thee,

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:43.929
knight at arms?" version.
 

00:40:43.929 --> 00:40:47.349
It's about a Morgan Le Fay-type.
 

00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:49.686
For better or worse,
whatever we think of that

00:40:49.686 --> 00:40:52.235
ideologically,
it is about,

00:40:52.235 --> 00:40:58.628
if the title is right,
the kind of woman who is evoked

00:40:58.628 --> 00:41:02.650
in the 1848 version,
as opposed to the kind of woman

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:04.739
who is evoked in the 1820
version.

00:41:04.739 --> 00:41:08.090
So the 1848 version is simply
more consistent with the title.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:11.900
That's one point to be made,
but the additional point to be

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:15.250
made is that taking advantage of
the New Historicist

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:18.469
acknowledgement that one's own
subjectivity,

00:41:18.469 --> 00:41:22.961
one's own historical horizon,
is properly in play in thinking

00:41:22.961 --> 00:41:27.456
about these things,
McGann is then able to infuse

00:41:27.456 --> 00:41:32.461
Keats's text and therefore
Keats's intentions with a

00:41:32.461 --> 00:41:35.800
pleasing political correctness.
 

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.119
That is to say,
Keats can't possibly have

00:41:38.119 --> 00:41:40.670
thought in that demeaning way
about women.

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:43.079
By the way, everything-- I like
Keats,

00:41:43.079 --> 00:41:45.840
but everything in his letters
suggests that he did--

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:49.329
but back to McGann:
Keats can't possibly have

00:41:49.329 --> 00:41:52.820
thought in that demeaning way
about women.

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:58.255
Therefore, the 1820 text is the
text that he intended and

00:41:58.255 --> 00:41:59.420
preferred.
 

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:00.900
Okay.
 

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.773
That, of course,
makes Keats more consistent

00:42:03.773 --> 00:42:07.452
with our own standards and our
own view of the relations

00:42:07.452 --> 00:42:09.956
between the sexes,
but does it,

00:42:09.956 --> 00:42:11.974
in other words,
make sense

00:42:11.974 --> 00:42:16.409
vis-à-vis the
Keats whom we know and,

00:42:16.409 --> 00:42:19.809
despite his weaknesses and
shortcomings,

00:42:19.809 --> 00:42:20.420
love?
 

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.510
There is a great deal,
in other words,

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:28.771
to be said over against
McGann's assertions about this

00:42:28.771 --> 00:42:32.847
textual issue,
not necessarily in defense of

00:42:32.847 --> 00:42:37.480
the 1848 text but agnostically
with respect to the two of them,

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.219
saying, "Yeah,
we'd better have both of them.

00:42:40.219 --> 00:42:42.210
We'd better put them
side-by-side.

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:46.599
We'd better read them together;
but if by some fiat the 1820

00:42:46.599 --> 00:42:51.369
were somehow subsequently
preferred to the 1848,

00:42:51.369 --> 00:42:57.130
that would be every bit as much
of an historical misfortune as

00:42:57.130 --> 00:43:00.547
the preference,
insofar as it has actually

00:43:00.547 --> 00:43:05.670
existed,
of the 1848 or the 1820."

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:08.579
I think that's the perspective
one wants to take.

00:43:08.579 --> 00:43:12.190
Now I was going to talk about
"To Autumn."

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:14.695
I'll only say about his reading
of "To Autumn"

00:43:14.695 --> 00:43:17.246
that McGann,
who doesn't seem to like the

00:43:17.246 --> 00:43:19.646
poem very much--
he likes "La Belle Dame

00:43:19.646 --> 00:43:21.592
Sans Merci,"
so he makes it politically

00:43:21.592 --> 00:43:22.090
correct.
 

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:24.963
He doesn't like "To
Autumn" because he thinks

00:43:24.963 --> 00:43:27.838
that "Autumn"
was published in collusion with

00:43:27.838 --> 00:43:31.139
Keats's conservative friends in
the Poems of 1820,

00:43:31.139 --> 00:43:34.476
which bowdlerized everything he
had to say of a progressive

00:43:34.476 --> 00:43:35.570
political nature.
 

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:37.800
He thinks that "To
Autumn" is a big sellout,

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.786
in other words,
and that yes,

00:43:39.786 --> 00:43:43.050
1819 happened to be a year of
good harvest,

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:46.382
and so Keats turns that year of
good harvest into something

00:43:46.382 --> 00:43:48.545
permanent,
into a kind of cloud

00:43:48.545 --> 00:43:52.793
cuckoo-land in which the fruit
falls into your basket and the

00:43:52.793 --> 00:43:56.900
fish jump into your net and
everything is just perfect.

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:59.320
Well, do you think the poem is
really like that?

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.255
You've read the third stanza,
which McGann totally ignores

00:44:02.255 --> 00:44:04.780
apart from "Where are the
songs of Spring?

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:05.869
Ay, where are they?"
 

00:44:05.869 --> 00:44:08.201
In other words,
he gives you the opening but he

00:44:08.201 --> 00:44:11.039
doesn't give you any sense of
the rest of the stanza,

00:44:11.039 --> 00:44:14.226
because for him "To
Autumn" is all about the

00:44:14.226 --> 00:44:15.130
first stanza.
 

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:19.329
For him, Keats seems to
identify with the bees who think

00:44:19.329 --> 00:44:22.876
warm days will never cease,
"for Summer has

00:44:22.876 --> 00:44:25.329
o'er-brimmed their clammy
cells."

00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:26.590
Keats is like a bee.
 

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:28.469
He's all into the sensuous.
 

00:44:28.469 --> 00:44:31.809
Well, again just in terms of
historical evidence,

00:44:31.809 --> 00:44:35.777
this is outmoded by at least
eighteen months if we consult

00:44:35.777 --> 00:44:37.170
Keats's letters.
 

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:39.940
He was like that early in his
career,

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:43.867
but he has had severe
misgivings about a point of view

00:44:43.867 --> 00:44:47.942
which is represented in what he
said in an early letter:

00:44:47.942 --> 00:44:50.686
"Oh,
for a life of sensations rather

00:44:50.686 --> 00:44:53.492
than thoughtsâ€¦"
That's no longer Keats's

00:44:53.492 --> 00:44:56.079
position when writing "To
Autumn."

00:44:56.079 --> 00:44:58.867
Keats's position when writing
"To Autumn"

00:44:58.867 --> 00:45:02.047
is the position of a guy who
has a sore throat just as his

00:45:02.047 --> 00:45:05.871
tubercular brother did,
who is increasingly afraid that

00:45:05.871 --> 00:45:10.246
he's going to die soon and is
trying to confront mortality in

00:45:10.246 --> 00:45:14.114
writing what is in fact--
and I say "in fact"

00:45:14.114 --> 00:45:16.860
advisedly--
the most perfect lyric ever

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:22.202
written in the English language,
and which is most certainly not

00:45:22.202 --> 00:45:27.318
a celebration of sort of
wandering around like an aimless

00:45:27.318 --> 00:45:29.244
bee,
thinking that the autumn is

00:45:29.244 --> 00:45:31.190
perfect but that autumn is
always perfect,

00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:35.061
that warm days will never
cease, and that everything is

00:45:35.061 --> 00:45:37.070
just lovely in the garden.
 

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:41.019
It is not that kind of poem,
and it's really a travesty of

00:45:41.019 --> 00:45:44.971
it to suppose that it is simply
on the grounds that it was

00:45:44.971 --> 00:45:49.407
published in the Poems of
1820 as a kind of sellout to the

00:45:49.407 --> 00:45:54.190
establishment under the advice
of Keats's conservative friends.

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:54.768
All right.
 

00:45:54.768 --> 00:45:58.559
So much then for McGann's
remarks on Keats,

00:45:58.559 --> 00:46:03.101
which I want to say again in no
way impugn or undermine the

00:46:03.101 --> 00:46:07.721
general validity of the claims
that he's making about taking

00:46:07.721 --> 00:46:11.010
historical circumstances into
account.

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:14.407
Precisely, we need to take them
into account and we need to get

00:46:14.407 --> 00:46:15.119
them right.
 

00:46:15.119 --> 00:46:18.333
That's the challenge,
of course, of working with

00:46:18.333 --> 00:46:20.179
historical circumstances.
 

00:46:20.179 --> 00:46:22.610
You have to get it right.
 

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:26.762
With that said,
let me turn quickly to a review

00:46:26.762 --> 00:46:31.550
of Tony from Bakhtin to
the New Historicism.

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:35.083
I may glide over Tony
according to Jameson,

00:46:35.083 --> 00:46:38.690
because we did that at the end
of the last lecture,

00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:41.070
so let me go back to Bakhtin.
 

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:44.632
You can see the way in which in
the structure of Tony the Tow

00:46:44.632 --> 00:46:47.971
Truck the first part of the
poem is absolutely saturated

00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:50.630
with the first person singular:
I do this,

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:54.541
I do that, I like my job,
I am stuck-- I,

00:46:54.541 --> 00:46:55.518
I, I, I.
 

00:46:55.518 --> 00:46:58.487
Then as you read along through
the text you see that the

00:46:58.487 --> 00:47:00.000
"I"
disappears,

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.521
or if it still appears,
it's in the middle of a line

00:47:02.521 --> 00:47:04.550
rather than at the beginning of
a line.

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:06.797
In other words,
the "I,"

00:47:06.797 --> 00:47:09.996
the subjectivity,
the first person singular,

00:47:09.996 --> 00:47:12.610
the sense of having a unique
voice--

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:18.880
this is gradually subsumed by
the sociality of the story as it

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:19.909
unfolds.
 

00:47:19.909 --> 00:47:24.666
I am no longer "I"
defined as a Romantic

00:47:24.666 --> 00:47:25.929
individual.
 

00:47:25.929 --> 00:47:29.489
I am "I,"
rather defined as a friend--

00:47:29.489 --> 00:47:32.574
that is to say,
as a person whose relation with

00:47:32.574 --> 00:47:35.659
otherness is what constitutes
his identity,

00:47:35.659 --> 00:47:38.289
and in that mutuality of
friendship,

00:47:38.289 --> 00:47:41.309
the first person singular
disappears.

00:47:41.309 --> 00:47:43.911
What is spoken in Tony the
Tow Truck, in other

00:47:43.911 --> 00:47:46.376
words,
in the long run is not the

00:47:46.376 --> 00:47:50.748
voice of individual subjectivity
but the voice of social

00:47:50.748 --> 00:47:55.909
togetherness,
the voice of otherness.

00:47:55.909 --> 00:47:58.534
According to Jauss,
the important thing about

00:47:58.534 --> 00:48:02.112
Tony the Tow Truck is
that it is not the same story as

00:48:02.112 --> 00:48:04.260
The Little Engine that Could.
 

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.518
In other words,
in each generation of

00:48:07.518 --> 00:48:11.673
reception, the aesthetic
standards that prevail at a

00:48:11.673 --> 00:48:16.400
given time are reconsidered and
rethought, reshuffled.

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.460
A new aesthetic horizon
emerges, and texts are

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:25.077
constituted in a different way,
much also as the Russian

00:48:25.077 --> 00:48:28.525
formalists have said,
only with the sense in Jauss of

00:48:28.525 --> 00:48:30.239
the historical imperative.
 

00:48:30.239 --> 00:48:34.666
The Little Engine that Could
is all about the inversion

00:48:34.666 --> 00:48:38.369
of power between the little guy
and the big guy,

00:48:38.369 --> 00:48:41.731
so that the little guy helps
the big guy and that is

00:48:41.731 --> 00:48:44.911
unequivocal,
showing, as in Isaiah in

00:48:44.911 --> 00:48:47.989
the Bible,
that the valleys have been

00:48:47.989 --> 00:48:51.849
raised and the mountains have
been made low.

00:48:51.849 --> 00:48:54.300
That's not the way Tony the
Tow Truck works.

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.679
The little guy himself needs
help.

00:48:56.679 --> 00:48:59.599
He needs the help of another
little guy.

00:48:59.599 --> 00:49:04.248
There is a reciprocity not
dialectically between little and

00:49:04.248 --> 00:49:07.510
big,
but a mutual reinforcement of

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:11.273
little-by-little,
and that is the change in

00:49:11.273 --> 00:49:15.981
aesthetic horizon that one can
witness between The Little

00:49:15.981 --> 00:49:20.449
Engine that Could and
Tony the Tow Truck.

00:49:20.449 --> 00:49:23.596
In Benjamin the important
thing, as I think we've said,

00:49:23.596 --> 00:49:26.860
is the idea that the
narrator is the apparatus.

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:30.932
The humanization of a
mechanized world,

00:49:30.932 --> 00:49:37.043
through our identification with
it, is what takes place in

00:49:37.043 --> 00:49:39.829
Tony the Tow Truck.
 

00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:42.119
In other words,
all these cars and trucks,

00:49:42.119 --> 00:49:45.059
all these smiling and frowning
houses,

00:49:45.059 --> 00:49:50.309
of course, have as their common
denominator their non-humanity,

00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:55.085
but the anthropomorphization of
the cars and trucks and of the

00:49:55.085 --> 00:49:58.139
houses constitutes them as the
human.

00:49:58.139 --> 00:50:00.250
They are precisely the human.
 

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:01.969
We see things,
in other words,

00:50:01.969 --> 00:50:04.460
from the point of view of the
apparatus.

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:08.217
Just as the filmgoer sees
things from the point of view of

00:50:08.217 --> 00:50:10.684
the camera,
so we see Tony the Tow Truck

00:50:10.684 --> 00:50:12.980
from the point of view of
the tow truck,

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:14.440
right?
 

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.760
And what happens?
 

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:22.250
Just as the camera eye point of
view leaves that which is seen,

00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:25.420
as Benjamin puts it,
"equipment-free"--

00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:28.894
so, oddly enough,
if we see things from the

00:50:28.894 --> 00:50:33.130
standpoint of equipment,
what we look at is the moral of

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:37.449
the story: in other words,
the humanity of the story.

00:50:37.449 --> 00:50:39.527
What we see,
in other words,

00:50:39.527 --> 00:50:43.530
surrounded by all of this
equipment, is precisely the

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:46.840
equipment-free human aspect of
reality.

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.835
So Tony the Tow Truck
works in a way that is

00:50:49.835 --> 00:50:52.590
consistent with Benjamin's
theory of mechanical

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:53.610
reproduction.
 

00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:58.385
For Adorno, however,
the acquiescence of this very

00:50:58.385 --> 00:51:01.391
figure--
the apparatus of mechanical

00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:06.061
reproduction,
of towing again and again and

00:51:06.061 --> 00:51:09.545
again--
in the inequity of class

00:51:09.545 --> 00:51:15.286
relations,
rejected as always by Neato and

00:51:15.286 --> 00:51:18.981
Speedy,
proves that the apparatus which

00:51:18.981 --> 00:51:23.610
Benjamin's theory takes to be
independent of the machinations

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:28.637
of the culture industry,
that the apparatus in turn can

00:51:28.637 --> 00:51:34.661
be suborned and commandeered by
the culture industry for its own

00:51:34.661 --> 00:51:35.809
purposes.
 

00:51:35.809 --> 00:51:36.289
All right.
 

00:51:36.289 --> 00:51:37.539
I will skip over Jameson.
 

00:51:37.539 --> 00:51:45.786
The Old Historicist reading of
Tony simply reconfirms a

00:51:45.786 --> 00:51:51.059
status quo in which virtue is
clear,

00:51:51.059 --> 00:51:55.389
vice is clear,
both are uncontested,

00:51:55.389 --> 00:51:57.800
and nothing changes--in other
words,

00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:02.179
a status quo which reflects a
stagnant,

00:52:02.179 --> 00:52:06.059
existent, unchanging social
dynamic.

00:52:06.059 --> 00:52:08.880
The New Historicism in a lot of
ways is doing this,

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:12.146
but let me just conclude by
suggesting that if literature

00:52:12.146 --> 00:52:15.588
influences history,
Tony the Tow Truck might

00:52:15.588 --> 00:52:19.840
well explain why today we're
promoting fuel-efficient cars,

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:25.670
why the attack on the gas
guzzler and the SUV or minivan--

00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:31.599
remember the car that says
"I am too busy"--

00:52:31.599 --> 00:52:35.800
is so prevalent in the story,
and why if we read today's

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:40.840
headlines we need to get rid of
the Humvee if GM is to prosper,

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:46.309
and we need to downsize and
streamline the available models.

00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:48.987
The little guys,
Tony and Bumpy,

00:52:48.987 --> 00:52:53.481
reaffirm the need for
fuel-efficient smaller vehicles

00:52:53.481 --> 00:52:58.318
and you can plainly see that
Tony the Tow Truck is

00:52:58.318 --> 00:53:02.639
therefore a discourse that
produces history.

00:53:02.639 --> 00:53:05.123
All of this,
according to the prescription

00:53:05.123 --> 00:53:07.969
of Tony, is
actually happening.

00:53:07.969 --> 00:53:08.579
All right.
 

00:53:08.579 --> 00:53:09.750
Thank you very much.
 

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:14.041
One thing that needs to be said
about Tony the Tow Truck

00:53:14.041 --> 00:53:18.110
is it has no women in it,
and that is the issue that

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:20.699
we'll be taking up on Thursday.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.700
Prof: Think back
to--this is meeting six.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.710
It's about the rise of the
joint stock corporation.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.848
The joint stock corporation is,
without doubt,

00:00:12.848 --> 00:00:19.700
the most important institution
in the world economy today.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.655
Its only rival might be states
or governments,

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:27.610
but it is just a massively
important thing.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.628
The question of how it got here
and why it takes the form it

00:00:33.628 --> 00:00:36.280
does is our topic today.
 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.440
Let's begin with Adam Smith.
 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.765
Would somebody--would one of
you guys go up there and get

00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:53.221
that on slide one slideshow and
I'll rejoin it when we get

00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:54.530
there?
 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.960
Adam Smith, in talking about
the invisible hand,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.629
is also at length to say that
the productive use of the

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:11.930
division of labor kicks in only
when you get big markets,

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.757
only where market scale
justifies an elaborate division

00:01:16.757 --> 00:01:20.870
of labor and a large investment
of capital,

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:28.569
do you get the benefits of
capitalism, really.

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:30.640
In tiny markets where you're
making,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.950
for example,
clothing for others in a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.004
village of a thousand,
the possibility of a

00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:44.930
sophisticated manufacturing
scheme which--

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.580
&gt;
 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:02:08.069
--somebody who knows this stuff
please do this.

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.280
Navigator.
 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.028
Get it into navigator and then
onto slide one and play

00:02:16.028 --> 00:02:19.340
slideshow and we're set.
 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.990
So Smith talks about scale of
markets,

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.251
and the great limitation on
scale of markets until the early

00:02:30.251 --> 00:02:35.770
1800s was the poor quality of
land transportation.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.180
Ocean transportation had by
that time gotten pretty good.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.275
Sailing ships had gotten better
and better in the three or four

00:02:48.275 --> 00:02:54.340
hundred years before 1800,
and steamships had improved

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.370
that.
 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:03.318
But--I'm going to skip some
slides--

00:03:03.318 --> 00:03:09.205
but the great interior of all
the continents still relied on

00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:14.300
transportation systems,
none of which were superior to

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.050
a horse.
 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.881
The cheapest form of
transportation was canal

00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:23.932
shipping where the motor power
was essentially a horse on a

00:03:23.932 --> 00:03:26.720
draw path next to the canal.
 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:37.054
Then beginning in the 1820s and
accelerating decade after decade

00:03:37.054 --> 00:03:43.780
into the 1860s,
the railroad took over.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.694
For the first time ever one
could move freight vastly faster

00:03:48.694 --> 00:03:52.026
than a horse,
and vastly cheaper than any

00:03:52.026 --> 00:03:55.110
previous means of
transportation.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:02.627
The cities grew up initially at
the intersection of ocean

00:04:02.627 --> 00:04:08.400
shipping, coastwise shipping,
and canals.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.943
They grew up because there was
always an economic advantage to

00:04:13.943 --> 00:04:18.851
being at the junction point
between the main systems of

00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:20.579
transportation.
 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.889
Rail took this and raised it by
many powers.

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:33.329
The American Rail Network,
this is a simplified map Rand

00:04:33.329 --> 00:04:40.230
McNally from 1944,
and it's about passenger rail.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.560
The real density of the U.S.
 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.769
rail network is about five
times what this suggests.

00:04:47.769 --> 00:04:53.913
That density created exactly
what Adam Smith contemplated:

00:04:53.913 --> 00:04:59.625
a gigantic market where the
division of labor could be

00:04:59.625 --> 00:05:05.230
refined to a much higher level
than ever before.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.815
One result of that--this is a
contemporary map of greater New

00:05:10.815 --> 00:05:15.750
York, and the coloring is
dollars of earned income per

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.240
square mile.
 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.954
The densest places,
right around in here,

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:28.319
reach past ten billion such
dollars per square mile.

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:34.845
The great cities of the world
are invariably ones today which

00:05:34.845 --> 00:05:38.543
enjoy powerful rail
transportation,

00:05:38.543 --> 00:05:44.089
generally supplemented by water
transportation.

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:48.550
But rail, and New York's
extraordinary advantage as a

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.670
gateway to the interior of the
United States,

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.045
by water first up through the
Hudson and then across the Erie

00:05:56.045 --> 00:06:00.170
Canal to the Great Lakes,
and then beginning with the

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.747
1840s, a fabulous deepwater
harbor for shipments to the rest

00:06:05.747 --> 00:06:11.230
of the world connected by rail
to the entire continent.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.750
The double challenge faced by
railroads,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.778
two things, one they were very
expensive to build,

00:06:19.778 --> 00:06:24.726
so finance capital,
raising large amounts of money

00:06:24.726 --> 00:06:30.670
in order to construct railways,
was one challenge.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.391
In some senses,
an even greater challenge was

00:06:34.391 --> 00:06:36.930
actually running a railroad.
 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.274
It turns out that railroads get
inordinately complicated after

00:06:42.274 --> 00:06:43.589
they get big.
 

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:47.100
When they are one section of
about forty or fifty miles,

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.930
railroads are actually not very
complicated things to run.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.545
But when they get to be
hundreds or even thousands of

00:06:55.545 --> 00:06:59.718
miles, the logistics of
management get extremely

00:06:59.718 --> 00:07:01.139
challenging.
 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:03.560
So you have two challenges;
one is finance,

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.759
the other is operations.
 

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:08.079
Let's start with operations.
 

00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:12.490
In the nineteenth century train
collisions occurred at rates

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.528
varying from about 400 to 1,000
a year in the U.S.,

00:07:16.528 --> 00:07:23.451
and they were often ugly,
and they reflected the

00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:27.278
challenge of management.
 

00:07:27.278 --> 00:07:31.882
This is a simple one section
rail that operated in the 1840s

00:07:31.882 --> 00:07:36.250
and 1850s between Boston and
Worcester, Massachusetts.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.180
Almost all the railroads built
just one track.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.125
The question was:
How do you run trains back and

00:07:44.125 --> 00:07:48.490
forth between these two cities
without collisions?

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.889
The solution,
it's in Chandler,

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:55.449
that these people had was to
instruct the engineers of the

00:07:55.449 --> 00:08:00.970
trains beginning at the two end
cities to proceed to Framingham,

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:05.430
and one turns--and each take a
right turn so to speak--

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:09.889
and sit there until the other
train is in view.

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:13.017
After the other train is in
view and stopped,

00:08:13.017 --> 00:08:15.649
proceed to the end of your
journey.

00:08:15.649 --> 00:08:18.329
Pretty simple management.
 

00:08:18.329 --> 00:08:20.699
And that railroad had only
about fifty employees.

00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:26.120
It was four trips a day,
and a very simple thing.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:31.964
Characteristic of capitalism is
that people are not content with

00:08:31.964 --> 00:08:33.450
small success.
 

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:39.024
Therefore, they try to string
together many short railroads on

00:08:39.024 --> 00:08:43.775
the theory that average cost
will decline as scale of

00:08:43.775 --> 00:08:45.970
operation increases.
 

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:51.803
The New York Central System,
which was the glitziest of all

00:08:51.803 --> 00:08:57.822
the railways at its peak,
it's peak coming roughly from

00:08:57.822 --> 00:09:03.899
the period of World War I to the
end of World War II,

00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:10.277
this railroad was created by
splicing together dozens of

00:09:10.277 --> 00:09:12.480
little railroads.
 

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.812
The Mohawk and Hudson ran
between Schenectady and Albany,

00:09:16.812 --> 00:09:20.759
and it was the kernel from
which this was formed.

00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:27.840
It's one aggregation after
another,

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.948
and the construction of that
marvelous terminal in midtown

00:09:31.948 --> 00:09:35.048
Manhattan which we're all
familiar with,

00:09:35.048 --> 00:09:40.533
and ultimately,
after the thing reaches the end

00:09:40.533 --> 00:09:45.914
of its competitive lifecycle,
and the New York Central

00:09:45.914 --> 00:09:50.025
Railroad was essentially at the
end of its competitive lifecycle

00:09:50.025 --> 00:09:51.070
by the 1950s.
 

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.090
It was there because?
 

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.899
What was hard on railroads?
 

00:09:56.899 --> 00:09:58.509
What was hard on passenger
railroads?

00:09:58.509 --> 00:10:01.529
Long haul passenger railroads?
 

00:10:01.529 --> 00:10:03.580
This is a soft pitch, guys.
 

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.370
Yes.
 

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.039
Student:  Introduced the
highway system.

00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:08.110
Prof: Highway system.
 

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:11.672
And on freight,
what was the big competitor

00:10:11.672 --> 00:10:12.690
over land?
 

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.960
Student:  Interstate
highway.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.090
Prof: Okay,
so the interstate highway

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.865
system with trucking and
ultimately de-regulated trucking

00:10:19.865 --> 00:10:24.556
which was much more efficient,
the competitive position of

00:10:24.556 --> 00:10:28.168
railroads seemed to be terminal.
 

00:10:28.168 --> 00:10:32.767
And the Pennsylvania Railroad
and the New York Central were

00:10:32.767 --> 00:10:37.048
combined in a bankruptcy
proceeding in 1968 to form The

00:10:37.048 --> 00:10:41.082
Penn-Central System,
which soon went bankrupt,

00:10:41.082 --> 00:10:45.847
and it went bankrupt because
the two managements hated each

00:10:45.847 --> 00:10:48.071
other,
and each did as little as

00:10:48.071 --> 00:10:50.090
possible to help the other
succeed.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:54.868
The--this idea of a mortal
lifecycle of the corporation is

00:10:54.868 --> 00:10:57.970
one which comes up again and
again.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:02.067
A week from today we'll do the
Polaroid Corporation which

00:11:02.067 --> 00:11:06.750
begins as a brilliant innovative
firm and ends up playing defense

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:11.376
against other more brilliant,
more innovative firms,

00:11:11.376 --> 00:11:15.750
only a generation and a half
after it began.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:21.437
What really happens with
railroads if you don't know how

00:11:21.437 --> 00:11:24.715
to run them,
and the early railroads nobody

00:11:24.715 --> 00:11:28.097
knew how to run,
was that as the railroad scope

00:11:28.097 --> 00:11:31.820
or scale got larger,
average costs actually went up.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:37.136
The reason they went up was
that you had to build a mammoth

00:11:37.136 --> 00:11:39.980
bureaucracy to run the thing.
 

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:44.889
The Pennsylvania Railroad got
to 50,000 employees fast.

00:11:44.889 --> 00:11:52.711
The challenge of how to
organize that large workforce

00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:55.120
became severe.
 

00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:00.153
The first cut was spatial,
without the kind of

00:12:00.153 --> 00:12:06.528
surveillance and information
technology we have today,

00:12:06.528 --> 00:12:10.817
they had the telegraph fairly
early on and that's all they

00:12:10.817 --> 00:12:11.269
had.
 

00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:17.308
The control over a massive
network--

00:12:17.308 --> 00:12:18.840
this is The New York Central
System--

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:24.004
meant that they cut the system
into sections and created a set

00:12:24.004 --> 00:12:27.558
of authorities within each such
section.

00:12:27.558 --> 00:12:30.308
The ones I've drawn here in red
are merely illustrative.

00:12:30.308 --> 00:12:36.139
Then there was a division of
function.

00:12:36.139 --> 00:12:39.149
There were people who worried
about railroad cars.

00:12:39.149 --> 00:12:42.178
There were people who worried
about track.

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:44.796
There were people who dealt
with passengers,

00:12:44.796 --> 00:12:47.533
others with freight,
finance, cost accounting,

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:49.418
human resources,
and so on.

00:12:49.418 --> 00:12:53.928
So you have all these
functional stripes--

00:12:53.928 --> 00:12:57.658
all this is Chandler,
and I'm just simplifying what

00:12:57.658 --> 00:13:00.908
he says--
these functional stripes,

00:13:00.908 --> 00:13:05.379
and then you've got the
geographic sections,

00:13:05.379 --> 00:13:21.933
and the question becomes,
what do you with the

00:13:21.933 --> 00:13:27.820
intersections?
 

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.730
The fundamental administrative
question was,

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:34.606
do you let the functional
groups boss the geographic

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:37.464
groups around,
or do you let the geographic

00:13:37.464 --> 00:13:39.808
groups boss the functional
groups around?

00:13:39.808 --> 00:13:45.143
What ended up happening was
this pattern,

00:13:45.143 --> 00:13:53.009
which ultimately gives priority
to the geographic groups.

00:13:53.009 --> 00:13:57.908
It creates enormous power at
the top in general management.

00:13:57.908 --> 00:14:04.419
And the top people in American
railroad, who were very well

00:14:04.419 --> 00:14:09.246
compensated, often took on
ownership stakes,

00:14:09.246 --> 00:14:12.389
and were true big shots.
 

00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:16.600
The functional people operated
as staff to them;

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.552
the people who did accounting,
the people who did finance,

00:14:19.552 --> 00:14:21.158
the people who did
construction,

00:14:21.158 --> 00:14:23.490
maintenance,
and rolling stock and so on.

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:29.899
Then there were several tiers
of specific managers,

00:14:29.899 --> 00:14:33.548
superintendents with
responsibility for geographic

00:14:33.548 --> 00:14:36.037
areas,
and they too had functionally

00:14:36.037 --> 00:14:38.740
divided staff--
people to worry about the

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.827
rolling stock,
the track, the construction,

00:14:42.827 --> 00:14:49.148
etc.--and the pivotal decision
makers were always the people

00:14:49.148 --> 00:14:52.038
with a geographic focus.
 

00:14:52.038 --> 00:14:55.601
They were the ones who had to
take all the factors,

00:14:55.601 --> 00:14:59.450
all the functions together,
and make the thing work.

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:04.005
They became the first general
managers of the modern

00:15:04.005 --> 00:15:07.668
description that MBAs are
training for.

00:15:07.668 --> 00:15:14.996
It's essentially the origin of
the managerially operated joint

00:15:14.996 --> 00:15:17.399
stock corporation.
 

00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:23.495
The Europeans used a different
pattern, which gave priority to

00:15:23.495 --> 00:15:26.591
the functions,
and by and large,

00:15:26.591 --> 00:15:30.389
the American system worked
better.

00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:33.047
Now why are European trains so
much better than American trains

00:15:33.047 --> 00:15:33.389
today?
 

00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:35.110
Anybody know?
 

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.649
Let's hear.
 

00:15:36.649 --> 00:15:38.370
Student:  Socialism.
 

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.820
Prof: Socialism!
 

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.480
Okay, yeah socialism is part of
it.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.090
Please elaborate;
let's get from one word to ten.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.808
We got a mic?
 

00:15:48.808 --> 00:15:57.897
Student:  People seem to
be more comfortable in states in

00:15:57.897 --> 00:16:05.254
the Eurozone with diverting
taxpayer money to public

00:16:05.254 --> 00:16:09.330
project,
such as infrastructure.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.028
Prof: Okay,
this is particularly true of

00:16:11.028 --> 00:16:12.100
continental Europe I think.
 

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:19.134
Where the trains have become,
in many, not quite all cases,

00:16:19.134 --> 00:16:22.528
publicly operated systems.
 

00:16:22.528 --> 00:16:26.759
There's another reason,
there's a historical reason.

00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:29.470
Student:  The price of
gasoline.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.330
Prof: Price of gasoline,
that's another point.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:32.889
I hadn't actually connected the
dots.

00:16:32.889 --> 00:16:37.148
Gasoline there is roughly two
or three times what it is here,

00:16:37.148 --> 00:16:41.192
so passenger train for short
and middle sized runs makes a

00:16:41.192 --> 00:16:42.399
lot of sense.
 

00:16:42.399 --> 00:16:44.759
Big historical event, yes?
 

00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:46.695
Student:  They didn't
really have--the interstate

00:16:46.695 --> 00:16:47.610
highway kind of bloomed.
 

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:51.600
Prof: Say again?
 

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.346
Student:  Like they
didn't have like a highway

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:54.590
system or
&gt;

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.620
Prof: Okay,
I think--well some of them did.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.375
I mean the German Autobahn was
pretty impressive,

00:16:59.375 --> 00:17:02.649
even if the Nazis built it,
it was pretty good highway.

00:17:02.649 --> 00:17:06.680
What I'm fishing for here is
World War II.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.048
World War II destroyed the
European rail system,

00:17:10.048 --> 00:17:13.990
and because it was destroyed,
and because of the U.S.

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.721
Marshal Fund,
which paid for an awful lot of

00:17:16.721 --> 00:17:19.582
reconstruction,
they started more or less from

00:17:19.582 --> 00:17:21.868
scratch and made the thing work.
 

00:17:21.868 --> 00:17:27.837
We had this higgledy-piggledy
remnant of a previous period,

00:17:27.837 --> 00:17:33.086
and never really made the
investment by socialism or

00:17:33.086 --> 00:17:34.630
capitalism.
 

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:39.501
The challenge of finance was
equally important,

00:17:39.501 --> 00:17:42.150
perhaps more important.
 

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:47.038
Historically,
projects that involved high

00:17:47.038 --> 00:17:52.048
capital investment were funded
locally.

00:17:52.048 --> 00:17:55.288
People made investments within
small circles,

00:17:55.288 --> 00:18:00.212
within one city,
within the people who lived

00:18:00.212 --> 00:18:03.333
next--
the zone where people living

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:07.108
next to a canal or a segment of
a canal would,

00:18:07.108 --> 00:18:09.440
in effect, buy bonds and
finance the thing.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:15.617
Railroads were catastrophically
expensive, they sucked up vast

00:18:15.617 --> 00:18:20.175
amounts of capital,
and so a device as in this

00:18:20.175 --> 00:18:23.618
bridge, the Eads Bridge in St.
 

00:18:23.618 --> 00:18:26.646
Louis over the Mississippi,
there were hundreds,

00:18:26.646 --> 00:18:30.576
even thousands of terrifically
expensive construction projects

00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:31.798
to be financed.
 

00:18:31.798 --> 00:18:36.980
The mechanism chosen was the
joint stock corporation.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:43.327
The forms of funding were of
two main kinds,

00:18:43.327 --> 00:18:50.118
I'm going to get to some detail
in a minute.

00:18:50.118 --> 00:18:55.506
One were railroad bonds where
people in effect loaned money to

00:18:55.506 --> 00:19:00.009
the railroads and achieved a
predictable income,

00:19:00.009 --> 00:19:04.828
relatively predictable income,
from that investment in debt.

00:19:04.828 --> 00:19:10.339
The other was the joint stock,
where you bought into the

00:19:10.339 --> 00:19:15.450
equity of the company and became
a partial owner.

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:21.887
This is a world railroad grid,
and I'd like you to just in

00:19:21.887 --> 00:19:27.308
passing notice the very uneven
density of it,

00:19:27.308 --> 00:19:32.771
and the fairly strong
correlation between the density

00:19:32.771 --> 00:19:38.130
of the railroad grid and the
wealth of the place.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:42.827
The railroads were both cause
and effect of capitalist

00:19:42.827 --> 00:19:44.068
development.
 

00:19:44.068 --> 00:19:46.405
Where there were railroads,
there was capitalist

00:19:46.405 --> 00:19:49.140
development, where capitalist
development, railroads.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.630
And colonialism had odd effects.
 

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:57.731
Africa's railway system got
developed not so much to create

00:19:57.731 --> 00:20:04.361
internal markets as to get goods
quickly and efficiently out for

00:20:04.361 --> 00:20:08.568
shipment to the metropolitan
power,

00:20:08.568 --> 00:20:12.619
which controlled the
colonization.

00:20:12.619 --> 00:20:19.990
Now a chart, the dreaded chart.
 

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:26.170
And here we have on the
vertical dimension three major

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.618
forms of ownership.
 

00:20:28.618 --> 00:20:31.070
Indeed, these are the three
most important forms of

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.660
ownership.
 

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:35.650
Proprietorship means outright
ownership.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:38.058
You just own it, end of story.
 

00:20:38.058 --> 00:20:44.118
Partnership means what it says,
and interestingly,

00:20:44.118 --> 00:20:46.792
and for reasons you'll probably
figure out by the end of the

00:20:46.792 --> 00:20:48.470
hour if you don't know it
already,

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:53.470
partnerships tend to be used in
a certain kind of company.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:59.086
It's a company where the value
of the firm consists largely in

00:20:59.086 --> 00:21:04.980
the talent of its employees so
that the big consulting firms,

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:10.180
the big investment banks,
the big law firms,

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:14.838
all take the form of
partnerships and they are--

00:21:14.838 --> 00:21:18.679
and that actually changes and
one of the HBS cases you're

00:21:18.679 --> 00:21:23.067
getting is the one where Goldman
Sachs ceases to be a partnership

00:21:23.067 --> 00:21:24.848
and becomes a company.
 

00:21:24.848 --> 00:21:28.740
And of course third,
the joint stock corporation.

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:34.953
Then we look at each of these
with the five considerations

00:21:34.953 --> 00:21:37.680
across the top in mind.
 

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.380
One is, what's the
accountability chain here?

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.058
How do we keep people doing
their job?

00:21:42.058 --> 00:21:45.442
How do we see the difference
between a job well done and a

00:21:45.442 --> 00:21:46.509
job poorly done?
 

00:21:46.509 --> 00:21:53.163
The second is the role of
ownership and the third is

00:21:53.163 --> 00:21:54.730
liability.
 

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.869
Every one of these is a huge
factor in understanding this.

00:21:57.869 --> 00:22:00.970
The fourth is liquidity.
 

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:05.657
If I own something or a part of
something, how easy is it for me

00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:06.700
to sell out?
 

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:12.140
Finally scalability;
to what extent can we start

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:16.028
with something small and grow
something enormous?

00:22:16.028 --> 00:22:19.865
The three forms vary
importantly in each of these

00:22:19.865 --> 00:22:23.301
five dimensions,
and I'm afraid I'm going to

00:22:23.301 --> 00:22:25.380
walk you through them.
 

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.834
The chain of accountability in
a proprietorship is pretty

00:22:29.834 --> 00:22:30.548
simple.
 

00:22:30.548 --> 00:22:33.640
I own it, I run it,
I'm the boss.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:38.134
I hire and fire the employees,
I make the business decisions,

00:22:38.134 --> 00:22:42.029
I don't submit plans to anyone
else, I just do it.

00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:47.240
In a very small enterprise,
that has its advantages.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:53.240
In a partnership things are
more complicated.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:57.765
The trouble with a partnership
is this: Every partner has a

00:22:57.765 --> 00:23:00.730
right to participate in
management,

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:06.672
and I can't admit a new partner
without the consent of the other

00:23:06.672 --> 00:23:07.710
partners.
 

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:14.298
Now the work around for this is
the hybrid form,

00:23:14.298 --> 00:23:16.740
which creates a general partner
who runs it,

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.660
and then a bunch of limited
investment partners who

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.679
participate passively,
and lots and lots of things

00:23:23.679 --> 00:23:25.858
take that hybrid form.
 

00:23:25.858 --> 00:23:28.778
The pure partnership is very
awkward.

00:23:28.778 --> 00:23:31.720
You've got to talk to everybody
all the time;

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.069
it's like being married to a
room full of people at once.

00:23:35.069 --> 00:23:37.150
What a nightmare!
 

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:43.366
The corporation,
the chain of accountability is

00:23:43.366 --> 00:23:48.910
very different,
and it looks like this.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:55.143
You've got investors over here;
you've got capital markets with

00:23:55.143 --> 00:23:59.078
brokerages, stock exchanges,
and such like;

00:23:59.078 --> 00:24:03.462
then you've got a board of
directors, then top management,

00:24:03.462 --> 00:24:07.384
then layers of other
management, and then layer upon

00:24:07.384 --> 00:24:09.769
layer of regular employees.
 

00:24:09.769 --> 00:24:15.278
And the chain of accountability
is the white line.

00:24:15.278 --> 00:24:20.298
I've made this one a little
crooked because it is a little

00:24:20.298 --> 00:24:21.180
crooked.
 

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:26.769
How many of you own a stock in
a specific company?

00:24:26.769 --> 00:24:34.663
Not--can we get a mic down to
this gentleman here with the

00:24:34.663 --> 00:24:38.680
olive colored shirt please?
 

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.420
Is it a publicly traded company?
 

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:41.690
Student:  Yes.
 

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.170
Prof: Name it please.
 

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:45.299
Student:  Sasol.
 

00:24:45.299 --> 00:24:46.400
Prof: Pardon.
 

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.368
Student:  It's called
Sasol;

00:24:47.368 --> 00:24:48.788
it's a South African oil
company.

00:24:48.788 --> 00:24:51.663
Prof: Okay,
and you take an active role in

00:24:51.663 --> 00:24:52.980
running the company?
 

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:53.960
Student:  No.
 

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:58.440
Prof: Do you like
everything the management does?

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.078
Student:  No.
 

00:25:00.078 --> 00:25:02.930
Prof: Why don't you fix
it then?

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:05.035
Student:  Because I
don't own enough shares to make

00:25:05.035 --> 00:25:05.588
a difference.
 

00:25:05.588 --> 00:25:09.246
Prof: Okay,
and if you called up the CEO

00:25:09.246 --> 00:25:11.803
and said,
"I don't like what you're

00:25:11.803 --> 00:25:14.795
doing," how would you
imagine the conversation would

00:25:14.795 --> 00:25:15.170
run?
 

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:16.430
Student:  Very short.
 

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:18.963
Prof: It would be short
and what would his

00:25:18.963 --> 00:25:21.339
suggestion--his not indecent
suggestion be?

00:25:21.339 --> 00:25:24.650
Student:  Pound sand.
 

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:28.019
Prof: Pardon.
 

00:25:28.019 --> 00:25:28.798
Student:  Pound sand.
 

00:25:28.798 --> 00:25:31.490
Prof: Okay,
pound sand or sell the damn

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:31.970
stock.
 

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:34.470
You don't like it, get out.
 

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:41.892
The characteristically weak
control that investors have here

00:25:41.892 --> 00:25:47.680
puts enormous importance on the
exit option.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:52.279
Indeed, the exit option becomes
dominant.

00:25:52.279 --> 00:25:54.547
And in day trading,
for example,

00:25:54.547 --> 00:25:58.568
what people are doing is owning
companies for very short

00:25:58.568 --> 00:26:01.928
periods,
owning tiny slices of companies

00:26:01.928 --> 00:26:07.463
for very short periods,
and exercising no influence or

00:26:07.463 --> 00:26:11.980
accountability but just,
"I don't like it,

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:13.318
I'm gone,"
or,

00:26:13.318 --> 00:26:16.670
"I believe the price is
going to fall,

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:18.470
I'll short the stock and get
out."

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:23.950
What you've created here is a
brilliant device for scooping up

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:29.430
small amounts of investment from
a large amount of people,

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:32.414
a large number of people,
so that with a joint stock

00:26:32.414 --> 00:26:34.640
corporation you can have
thousands,

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.521
tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands of

00:26:36.521 --> 00:26:37.058
investors.
 

00:26:37.058 --> 00:26:40.902
They don't know each other,
they don't talk to each other

00:26:40.902 --> 00:26:44.205
by and large,
only the large institutional

00:26:44.205 --> 00:26:48.538
investors track the company's
behavior with any care,

00:26:48.538 --> 00:26:52.000
the specific fundamentals of
the company,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.990
and the distancing--think about
proprietorship,

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:02.220
where the boss is in the shop;
and partnership,

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.630
where the owners are the
partners who actually do it.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:09.300
We've come a long way from that
with the joint stock

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:13.190
corporation, and it's an
extremely efficient device for

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:15.348
raising money in that way.
 

00:27:15.348 --> 00:27:19.464
The internal operation,
on the other hand,

00:27:19.464 --> 00:27:20.769
is complex.
 

00:27:20.769 --> 00:27:26.210
You've got market mechanisms of
exchange outside the firm,

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:30.509
but inside the firm you've got
to manage people,

00:27:30.509 --> 00:27:35.266
you've got to incent them,
motivate them to do what needs

00:27:35.266 --> 00:27:37.048
doing for the firm.
 

00:27:37.048 --> 00:27:42.713
The board of directors plays a
symbolically central role in all

00:27:42.713 --> 00:27:46.460
this because they pick top
management,

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:50.109
and top management is
accountable to them,

00:27:50.109 --> 00:27:52.269
at least in theory.
 

00:27:52.269 --> 00:27:56.548
If you think about the recent
crisis in American capitalism,

00:27:56.548 --> 00:28:01.788
a lot of it has to do with the
fact that boards have failed,

00:28:01.788 --> 00:28:07.022
sometimes catastrophically,
to exercise any real

00:28:07.022 --> 00:28:10.920
accountability on top
management.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:15.255
The characteristic problem,
which I've mentioned to you a

00:28:15.255 --> 00:28:18.584
couple of times,
about the firm is so-called

00:28:18.584 --> 00:28:22.895
principal agency;
I hire you to do something,

00:28:22.895 --> 00:28:26.180
and you go off and do it or
not.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:30.112
For example,
let's suppose I run something

00:28:30.112 --> 00:28:35.290
as simple as a bar and I hire
you--I'm not there in the

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:39.318
evening and I hire you to run
the bar.

00:28:39.318 --> 00:28:44.325
I give you an hourly wage,
and I let you keep your tips,

00:28:44.325 --> 00:28:49.604
what might occur to you as a
way to maximize your income at

00:28:49.604 --> 00:28:50.970
my expense?
 

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:55.190
Student:  Free drinks.
 

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:56.538
Prof: Free-who said it?
 

00:28:56.538 --> 00:28:58.910
Free drinks or the very deep
pour;

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:04.180
you order a scotch,
I pour you a double.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:08.210
You save the $5 and give me $2
of it.

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:12.520
The characteristic of this
situation is that you

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:18.210
have--what's your advantage over
me in scamming me this way?

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:20.440
Student:  I keep the
tips.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.828
Prof: You keep the tips.
 

00:29:21.828 --> 00:29:23.588
But how do you manage to get
away with it?

00:29:23.588 --> 00:29:26.564
If you called me up and said
I'm going to do this,

00:29:26.564 --> 00:29:27.960
I'd say you're fired.
 

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.160
But you get away with it.
 

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:31.920
Why?
 

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.269
Student:  You're not
there.

00:29:33.269 --> 00:29:34.460
Prof: I'm not there.
 

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.789
You have the eyes and ears on
the scene, and I don't.

00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:39.068
You're the agent.
 

00:29:39.068 --> 00:29:41.900
You have so-called information
asymmetry,

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:45.078
you know a lot more than I do
about what you're doing,

00:29:45.078 --> 00:29:50.101
and so the characteristic
problem for people trying to

00:29:50.101 --> 00:29:54.240
manage inside the box,
inside the firm,

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:59.105
is to keep others for whom--
for whose achievements or

00:29:59.105 --> 00:30:01.358
malfeasance they're
accountable--

00:30:01.358 --> 00:30:03.609
to keep them motivated and
honest.

00:30:03.609 --> 00:30:10.180
The role of ownership;
the sole proprietor runs the

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.288
thing, simple as that.
 

00:30:11.288 --> 00:30:14.155
Partnership,
they are all there except if

00:30:14.155 --> 00:30:17.685
you have the general partner,
but in general,

00:30:17.685 --> 00:30:21.150
say in a law firm they are all
involved,

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:25.356
they will typically create an
executive committee and maybe a

00:30:25.356 --> 00:30:28.488
managing partner,
but pushed to shove in a

00:30:28.488 --> 00:30:32.868
disagreement about the firm,
they are all part of management.

00:30:32.868 --> 00:30:38.058
You make them that because they
are your assets.

00:30:38.058 --> 00:30:41.430
In a good law firm the real
assets are the lawyers.

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:45.657
In the corporation the
ownership role is,

00:30:45.657 --> 00:30:51.048
as we saw a few minutes ago,
strongly attenuated.

00:30:51.048 --> 00:30:57.128
Now in actual fact there are
cases where stockholders rise up

00:30:57.128 --> 00:31:03.411
against management and throw the
board out and with a new board

00:31:03.411 --> 00:31:06.349
throw the management out.
 

00:31:06.349 --> 00:31:08.960
It does happen, it's just rare.
 

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:12.611
And it's rare because the
transaction costs,

00:31:12.611 --> 00:31:16.686
just the time and effort
required to organize the

00:31:16.686 --> 00:31:19.660
shareholders,
is quite extreme.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:25.436
Stocks;
this is a 1998 tabulation of

00:31:25.436 --> 00:31:28.220
the percentage of U.S.
 

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:34.088
households by income strata,
higher in yellow and lowest in

00:31:34.088 --> 00:31:39.150
green, who directly or
indirectly own companies.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:47.640
The gist is just what you would
think it would be.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.960
You have a majority of people
with six figure incomes,

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:55.057
and you've got to inflate a
little bit here from 1998 to

00:31:55.057 --> 00:31:59.096
now,
people with relatively high

00:31:59.096 --> 00:32:05.220
incomes are predominantly owners
of companies.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:10.112
The rate of ownership scales
down with income,

00:32:10.112 --> 00:32:14.352
which makes quite a lot
intuitive sense,

00:32:14.352 --> 00:32:20.440
but most of the stock is held
in very small parcels.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:26.903
And the putting together
of--forget a majority--putting

00:32:26.903 --> 00:32:33.486
together enough to be noticed,
which begins at about 5%,

00:32:33.486 --> 00:32:35.880
is a major task.
 

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:42.968
Liability;
with a proprietorship,

00:32:42.968 --> 00:32:48.788
if you do a harm to someone
else, a tort ,as lawyers say;

00:32:48.788 --> 00:32:55.616
if you sell someone a
contaminated bottle of drinking

00:32:55.616 --> 00:33:00.868
water, they can sue you without
limit.

00:33:00.868 --> 00:33:05.430
If your proprietorship is worth
$100,000,

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:09.250
and you've also got a home
worth $300,000,

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:14.470
and savings worth another
$100,000 to make $500,000,

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:16.670
they can go after all of that.
 

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:23.565
There is no protection against
lawsuits in the proprietorship

00:33:23.565 --> 00:33:24.368
form.
 

00:33:24.368 --> 00:33:27.950
With partnerships things are as
bad or worse.

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:31.098
Let's suppose Tim here and I
are partners,

00:33:31.098 --> 00:33:38.078
and Tim for reasons known only
to himself,

00:33:38.078 --> 00:33:42.433
creates a catastrophic train
wreck on the line between New

00:33:42.433 --> 00:33:46.711
Haven and New York one day and
does it in the name of our

00:33:46.711 --> 00:33:50.442
proprietorship,
maybe we're in the business of

00:33:50.442 --> 00:33:52.058
something for trains.
 

00:33:52.058 --> 00:33:56.792
And I'm on vacation in Europe,
and Tim calls me up and says,

00:33:56.792 --> 00:34:01.286
"We've killed 110 people,
things are really a little

00:34:01.286 --> 00:34:02.568
bleak."
 

00:34:02.568 --> 00:34:05.846
My problem then,
of course I'm sorry for Tim,

00:34:05.846 --> 00:34:09.050
I'm sorry that Tim will suffer
from this;

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:14.023
but I'm even sorrier about me
because the principle of joint

00:34:14.023 --> 00:34:18.744
and several liability applies to
partnerships so that the

00:34:18.744 --> 00:34:23.635
litigant can choose among the
partners and go after all the

00:34:23.635 --> 00:34:25.489
deepest pockets.
 

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:34.032
That is a really major flaw in
the ownership structure design

00:34:34.032 --> 00:34:39.159
from the individual point of
view.

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:43.233
The most striking single thing
about the joint stock

00:34:43.233 --> 00:34:46.989
corporation is that it has
limited liability.

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:55.029
By limited liability we mean if
you own 100 shares and they have

00:34:55.029 --> 00:35:01.014
a value of $7 a piece,
there's $700 worth of capital,

00:35:01.014 --> 00:35:06.324
the most you can lose is that
$700 no matter what the firm

00:35:06.324 --> 00:35:07.070
does.
 

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:11.146
The firm could blow up the
Atlantic coast and your

00:35:11.146 --> 00:35:15.889
liability would be limited to
the $700 which would be,

00:35:15.889 --> 00:35:19.663
in effect, you can lose all of
your investment but you can't do

00:35:19.663 --> 00:35:20.150
worse.
 

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:25.001
Now that's a hell of a deal,
that's an enormously attractive

00:35:25.001 --> 00:35:27.143
deal,
and if you think about the

00:35:27.143 --> 00:35:30.000
purpose of the joint stock
corporation it's easy to

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:30.800
understand.
 

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:35.150
It's easy to understand because
we want people to make

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:40.159
investments over something they
can't control and can't really

00:35:40.159 --> 00:35:42.460
see inside very clearly.
 

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:46.117
Now we will--I'll ask you
before the term is over to have

00:35:46.117 --> 00:35:49.904
a look at a quarterly filing by
a company so you get to see

00:35:49.904 --> 00:35:52.059
about what investors can see.
 

00:35:52.059 --> 00:35:56.442
If you can't control it and
have no very powerful

00:35:56.442 --> 00:36:01.920
surveillance over its behavior
you wouldn't want to invest in

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.849
it unless you were granted
relief from liability,

00:36:06.849 --> 00:36:09.909
and that's exactly the design.
 

00:36:09.909 --> 00:36:14.967
There was 100 years ago a race
to the bottom among the American

00:36:14.967 --> 00:36:19.617
states in how generously they
treat corporations under the

00:36:19.617 --> 00:36:20.268
law.
 

00:36:20.268 --> 00:36:25.869
The reigning champion among
American states for corporate

00:36:25.869 --> 00:36:27.670
law is Delaware.
 

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:31.090
Delaware corporations abound
everywhere,

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:34.463
and in particular,
in places that aren't Delaware

00:36:34.463 --> 00:36:38.373
or even close,
because these provisions are

00:36:38.373 --> 00:36:42.539
tightest from the corporate
point of view.

00:36:42.539 --> 00:36:46.659
Liquidity;
proprietorships are hard to

00:36:46.659 --> 00:36:47.090
sell.
 

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:52.284
In fact, often it's impossible
to really get the value out of

00:36:52.284 --> 00:36:56.179
them when you sell them outside
the family.

00:36:56.179 --> 00:36:59.478
Often, in fact,
with say retailing,

00:36:59.478 --> 00:37:04.329
the value of the firm is
substantially the goodwill

00:37:04.329 --> 00:37:08.210
toward the owner the customers
have.

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:14.653
When the owner sells it to
somebody else the value may go

00:37:14.653 --> 00:37:18.048
to zero,
although I was just--I had a

00:37:18.048 --> 00:37:22.385
boat in the marina on Lake
Champlain for a long time and I

00:37:22.385 --> 00:37:26.949
got tired and more tired of the
management of the marina;

00:37:26.949 --> 00:37:31.409
lazy, grasping,
unreliable, and I was talking

00:37:31.409 --> 00:37:36.679
to somebody on the phone
yesterday and they said,

00:37:36.679 --> 00:37:39.132
"You know there are new
owners up there,"

00:37:39.132 --> 00:37:40.309
and I thought:
Hazzah!

00:37:40.309 --> 00:37:41.889
I may take my boat back.
 

00:37:41.889 --> 00:37:47.170
The proprietorship is a very
delicate creature.

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:49.320
The partnership is worse.
 

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:53.688
Let's suppose that all of us
are the partners of Wiggin &amp;

00:37:53.688 --> 00:37:55.800
Dana law firm in New Haven.
 

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.789
We're all partners,
except Morgan here,

00:37:59.789 --> 00:38:05.670
and Morgan is a brilliant
student just finishing the Yale

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:09.030
school and I'm his advocate.
 

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:13.780
I say Morgan I'm going to make
you a partner.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:17.579
What do I have to do to make
that happen?

00:38:17.579 --> 00:38:20.583
In theory, there are ways to
shortcut this,

00:38:20.583 --> 00:38:24.590
but in theory I have to get the
consent of all of you.

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:31.936
And then suppose I say,
"I'm tired and old and I

00:38:31.936 --> 00:38:33.489
want out.
 

00:38:33.489 --> 00:38:38.344
I'm going to sell Jim Alexander
my partnership,"

00:38:38.344 --> 00:38:43.855
and Jim Alexander is generous
enough to offer me a large sum

00:38:43.855 --> 00:38:47.030
of money for that partnership.
 

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:51.949
Can I just send all of you a
memo about Jim now being a

00:38:51.949 --> 00:38:52.860
partner?
 

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.230
No, you've all got to approve
it.

00:38:55.230 --> 00:39:02.614
The illiquidity of the
partnership as a result is

00:39:02.614 --> 00:39:04.460
notorious.
 

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:07.739
The corporation is designed for
liquidity.

00:39:07.739 --> 00:39:13.456
You don't even ever have to see
the physical stock certificates,

00:39:13.456 --> 00:39:16.360
they are just electronic bits.
 

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:24.018
The time it takes to sell
securities is that.

00:39:24.018 --> 00:39:30.242
And the transaction costs are
extremely low compared to the

00:39:30.242 --> 00:39:31.530
other two.
 

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:36.293
Now scalability,
can we make this thing big or

00:39:36.293 --> 00:39:36.929
not?
 

00:39:36.929 --> 00:39:44.489
The answer here is in data,
these are--can you read this

00:39:44.489 --> 00:39:46.690
from the back?
 

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:53.320
There are about 18 million
proprietorships in the country;

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.059
a million and a third
partnerships,

00:39:56.059 --> 00:40:00.652
five million corporations,
and their average gross revenue

00:40:00.652 --> 00:40:03.150
per year are these numbers.
 

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:08.918
The standard story of a
proprietorship is the dry

00:40:08.918 --> 00:40:16.007
cleaner on the corner who makes
$1,000 a week and feels good

00:40:16.007 --> 00:40:17.570
about it.
 

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:20.650
These are actually gross
revenues not net.

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:26.297
What that means is that the
actual take home may be pretty

00:40:26.297 --> 00:40:27.090
small.
 

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:32.159
The ratios are suggestive of
scalability.

00:40:32.159 --> 00:40:35.409
The joint stock corporation is
made to get big.

00:40:35.409 --> 00:40:41.760
There are several subtypes of
corporation,

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:46.681
but probably the most profound
threshold for corporations is

00:40:46.681 --> 00:40:50.300
the public offering,
the initial public offering.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.746
When you take a firm from
private to public,

00:40:53.746 --> 00:40:56.072
that is when you,
for example,

00:40:56.072 --> 00:40:59.599
an S corporation is a very
private kind;

00:40:59.599 --> 00:41:02.081
you can only have 75
shareholders,

00:41:02.081 --> 00:41:05.764
you get some tax breaks,
but you can't market your

00:41:05.764 --> 00:41:07.869
shares to a wide public.
 

00:41:07.869 --> 00:41:12.030
When you go public--Jim you've
been through that,

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:15.929
going public with a company,
is that right?

00:41:15.929 --> 00:41:17.018
Jim Alexander:  Yes.
 

00:41:17.018 --> 00:41:19.420
Prof: Is there a mic for
Jim?

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.949
What's the process?
 

00:41:21.949 --> 00:41:24.969
This is Spinnaker Exploration.
 

00:41:24.969 --> 00:41:28.315
Jim Alexander:
 You have to interest

00:41:28.315 --> 00:41:32.139
various investment bankers in
your, quote, story,

00:41:32.139 --> 00:41:34.449
unquote, as they call it.
 

00:41:34.449 --> 00:41:38.967
You eventually choose a group
of people that you feel

00:41:38.967 --> 00:41:43.659
comfortable with and who feel
comfortable with you,

00:41:43.659 --> 00:41:46.902
you convert their analysts to
thinking you have good

00:41:46.902 --> 00:41:51.063
prospects,
you draw up a prospectus,

00:41:51.063 --> 00:41:55.695
which is both a selling,
and most importantly,

00:41:55.695 --> 00:41:59.969
a legal document describing--
ostensibly describing to the

00:41:59.969 --> 00:42:05.284
investors the principle risks
and potential returns of the

00:42:05.284 --> 00:42:06.590
investment.
 

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:13.186
You make sure that you have
what's viewed as a good lawyer

00:42:13.186 --> 00:42:17.503
helping you with that,
a lawyer with a good

00:42:17.503 --> 00:42:21.635
reputation, make sure that you
have audited financials by a

00:42:21.635 --> 00:42:25.914
firm of the highest reputation,
and then eventually when the

00:42:25.914 --> 00:42:29.614
timing is right you go around
the country for several weeks

00:42:29.614 --> 00:42:32.996
talking to prospective
institutional investors because

00:42:32.996 --> 00:42:36.887
retail investors at most retail
firms won't buy with the smart

00:42:36.887 --> 00:42:39.141
money,
which is deemed to be

00:42:39.141 --> 00:42:41.659
institutional,
it's not buying.

00:42:41.659 --> 00:42:48.338
Typically you end up with a
group situation where maybe 20%

00:42:48.338 --> 00:42:53.518
to 40% of your company is sold
in the IPO,

00:42:53.518 --> 00:42:57.320
new money coming in which
typically pay down debt,

00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:04.490
and you end up with 200 to 500
shareholders whom you then have

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:08.811
to keep happy,
at least for the first year or

00:43:08.811 --> 00:43:11.210
else bad things happen to you.
 

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:13.639
Prof: Good!
 

00:43:13.639 --> 00:43:16.550
Thanks.
 

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:22.056
The gigantic corporation is the
most productive,

00:43:22.056 --> 00:43:27.445
not the most creative
necessarily, but the most

00:43:27.445 --> 00:43:31.780
productive player in the
economy.

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:37.728
As you can see here,
nearly 90% of all the business

00:43:37.728 --> 00:43:44.748
done in the American economy is
done by corporations so that

00:43:44.748 --> 00:43:47.786
the--
an analysis of American

00:43:47.786 --> 00:43:52.914
capitalism or world capitalism
which neglects the joint stock

00:43:52.914 --> 00:43:57.190
corporation neglects the most
important player.

00:43:57.190 --> 00:44:02.226
We will be focused on those,
ones like the Pennsylvania

00:44:02.226 --> 00:44:05.400
Railroad here,
as we go forward.

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:10.000

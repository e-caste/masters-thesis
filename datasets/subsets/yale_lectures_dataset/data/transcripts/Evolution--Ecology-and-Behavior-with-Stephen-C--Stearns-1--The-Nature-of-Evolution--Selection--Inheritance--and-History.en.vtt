00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.750
Prof: Biological
evolution has two big ideas.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.121
One of them has to do with how
the process occurs,

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:13.530
and that's called
microevolution.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.210
It's evolution going on right
now.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.500
Evolution is going on in your
body right now.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.595
You've got about 10^(13th)
bacteria in each gram of your

00:00:21.595 --> 00:00:24.804
feces, and they have enough
mutations in them to cover the

00:00:24.804 --> 00:00:26.380
entire bacterial genome.
 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.607
Every time you flush the
toilet, you flush an entire new

00:00:29.607 --> 00:00:33.070
set of information on bacterial
genomes down the toilets.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.470
It's going on all the time.
 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.260
Now, the other major theme is
macroevolution.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.136
This process of microevolution
has created a history,

00:00:45.136 --> 00:00:49.450
and the history also constrains
the process.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.540
The process has been going on
for 3.8 billion years.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.203
It has created a history that
had unique events in it,

00:00:57.203 --> 00:01:00.865
and things happened in that
history that now constrain

00:01:00.865 --> 00:01:03.770
further microevolution going on
today.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.650
That's one of the tricky things
about evolution.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.750
It has many different scales.
 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.319
My wife always gets frustrated
with me.

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:11.489
She says, "Well when did
that happen?"

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:13.435
I say, "Oh not too long
ago, only about 20 million

00:01:13.435 --> 00:01:13.938
years."
 

00:01:13.938 --> 00:01:17.518
And, you know,
that's what happens when you

00:01:17.518 --> 00:01:21.950
become an evolutionary
biologist, you zoom in and out

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.909
of deep time a lot.
 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.938
And this process of
microevolution is going to be

00:01:26.938 --> 00:01:28.769
the first thing we examine.
 

00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:29.980
It's the nuts and bolts.
 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.489
It's what's really created the
patterns.

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:35.504
But the patterns of
macroevolution are also very

00:01:35.504 --> 00:01:39.032
important because they record
the history of life on the

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:42.239
planet and they constrain the
current process.

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:46.268
So the evolution part of the
course is set up basically with

00:01:46.268 --> 00:01:48.180
two introductory lectures.
 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.162
Then I'm going to spend six
lectures talking about

00:01:51.162 --> 00:01:53.050
microevolutionary principles.
 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.345
So these are things that you
can always return to if you are

00:01:59.345 --> 00:02:02.120
puzzled about a problem.
 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.837
Then there'll be five lectures
on how organisms are designed

00:02:05.837 --> 00:02:07.540
for reproductive success.
 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.346
This includes cool stuff like
sexual selection,

00:02:10.346 --> 00:02:12.419
mate choice,
that kind of stuff.

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:17.197
I usually manage to give the
sexual selection lecture just

00:02:17.197 --> 00:02:19.460
about on Valentine's Day.
 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.008
Then we'll do macroevolutionary
principles.

00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:26.050
This has to do both with
speciation,

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.304
how new species form,
and with how biologists now

00:02:30.304 --> 00:02:35.446
analyze the tree of life to try
to understand and infer the

00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:38.460
history of life on the planet.
 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.430
Then we'll take a look at that
history,

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.873
looking at key events--and this
includes both fossils and the

00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:48.853
diversity of organisms--
and some abstract organizing

00:02:48.853 --> 00:02:50.538
principles about life.
 

00:02:50.538 --> 00:02:54.717
So all of those are part of how
we can analyze the history of

00:02:54.717 --> 00:02:56.180
life on the planet.
 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.342
And then, just before Spring
Break, we will integrate micro

00:03:00.342 --> 00:03:01.848
and macroevolution.
 

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.550
We'll do it in two different
ways.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.042
We'll do it with co-evolution,
where micro and macro come

00:03:09.042 --> 00:03:11.540
together,
and we'll also do it with

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.508
evolutionary medicine,
where both kinds of thinking

00:03:15.508 --> 00:03:20.230
are necessary really to
understand disease and the

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.930
design of the human body.
 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.810
So where did this idea of
evolution come from?

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.250
Well, there are always ideas.
 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.397
You can go back to Aristotle
and find elements of

00:03:35.397 --> 00:03:37.758
evolutionary thought in
Aristotle.

00:03:37.758 --> 00:03:41.757
But really it's a nineteenth
century idea,

00:03:41.757 --> 00:03:47.412
and in order to see how it
developed let's go back to about

00:03:47.412 --> 00:03:51.872
1790 or 1800;
so at the end of the Century of

00:03:51.872 --> 00:03:53.590
the Enlightenment.
 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.480
At that point,
if you were to ask a

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.498
well-educated person living in a
Western culture how old the

00:04:01.498 --> 00:04:04.092
world is,
they would say,

00:04:04.092 --> 00:04:07.370
"Oh thousands of
years."

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.974
And if you were to ask them,
"Well, where did all these

00:04:10.974 --> 00:04:13.419
species on the planet come
from?"

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:17.163
they would say they were all
created just the way they look

00:04:17.163 --> 00:04:19.230
now and they've never changed.
 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.519
And if you asked them,
"Have there ever been any

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:24.670
species that went extinct?"
 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.584
they would say,
"No, everything that was

00:04:26.584 --> 00:04:28.978
created is still alive and can
be found somewhere on the

00:04:28.978 --> 00:04:29.720
planet."
 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.603
So when Alexander von Humboldt,
who was certainly a creature of

00:04:32.603 --> 00:04:35.819
The Enlightenment,
sets out to explore South

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:41.464
America, he thinks that he might
encounter some of those strange

00:04:41.464 --> 00:04:43.714
fossils,
that the French have been

00:04:43.714 --> 00:04:47.930
turning up in the Paris Basin,
on top of Tepuis in Venezuela.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.430
So he really thought that there
was a lost world.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.560
Of course, Arthur Conan Doyle
later wrote a novel about that.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.745
But these guys actually
thought, "Hey,

00:04:55.745 --> 00:04:58.502
I go to Venezuela or I go to
the Congo, I might meet a

00:04:58.502 --> 00:04:59.699
brontosaurus."
 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.910
That was what they thought at
that time.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.851
They thought that adaptations
were produced by divine

00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:07.990
intervention.
 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.439
They did not think that there
was a natural process that could

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:14.607
produce anything that was so
exquisitely designed as your

00:05:14.607 --> 00:05:15.060
eye.
 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.790
We now know that your eye is in
fact very badly designed,

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.189
but it looked pretty good to
them.

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:24.769
Anybody here know why the eye
is badly designed?

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:25.889
What's wrong with your eye?
 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.569
Student:  The blind spot.
 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:29.870
Prof: It's got a blind
spot and--?

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.149
Student: 
&gt;

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:34.343
Prof: It's got--the
nerves and the blood vessels are

00:05:34.343 --> 00:05:35.290
in front of the retina.
 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.824
The light has to go through the
nerves and the blood vessels,

00:05:38.824 --> 00:05:40.180
to get to the retina.
 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.209
The octopus has a much better
eye.

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:49.288
Okay, now by the time that
Darwin published his book in

00:05:49.288 --> 00:05:52.536
1859, people thought that the
world is very,

00:05:52.536 --> 00:05:54.940
very old;
how old they weren't sure.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.569
We now know about four-a-half
billion,

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:01.040
but at that point,
based on the rate of erosion of

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.370
mountains and on the saltiness
of the ocean,

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.370
assuming that the ocean had
been accumulating salt

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.697
continuously,
and that it hadn't been getting

00:06:09.697 --> 00:06:11.267
buried anywhere,
which it does,

00:06:11.267 --> 00:06:13.860
people thought hundreds of
millions of years.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.593
They weren't yet in the
billions range,

00:06:16.593 --> 00:06:19.470
but they thought hundreds of
millions.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.449
They knew that fossils probably
represent extinct species.

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:23.870
That was Cuvier's contribution.
 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:29.009
He did it for mammal fossils in
the Paris Basin.

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:35.596
Geoffrey Saint-Hilaire had had
a big debate with Cuvier about

00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:39.220
homology, and that was in 1830.
 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.526
By the way, it was one that
many people throughout Europe

00:06:43.526 --> 00:06:46.672
followed very closely--
this was a very,

00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:49.879
very key intellectual topic at
the time--

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:51.329
and it was about homology.
 

00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:56.824
Basically it was about the idea
that Geoffrey Saint-Hillaire had

00:06:56.824 --> 00:07:00.750
had that if my hand has five
fingers then--

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.834
and a bat's wing has five
fingers and the fin of a

00:07:03.834 --> 00:07:07.088
porpoise has five fingers--
that that indicates that we all

00:07:07.088 --> 00:07:09.300
got those five fingers from a
common ancestor,

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.906
and therefore we are related
because we had a common

00:07:11.906 --> 00:07:12.470
ancestor.
 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.129
So you could see that in 1830.
 

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:15.980
That's before Darwin publishes
his book.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.670
Okay?
 

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.632
Then of course we have the idea
that adaptations are produced by

00:07:23.632 --> 00:07:26.680
natural selection;
and we owe that to Darwin.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:32.803
And I will run through the
process he went through between

00:07:32.803 --> 00:07:35.920
1838 and 1859 very briefly.
 

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:42.194
This is one of the most
important ideas about the nature

00:07:42.194 --> 00:07:44.651
of life,
and therefore about the human

00:07:44.651 --> 00:07:47.403
condition,
that's ever been published,

00:07:47.403 --> 00:07:50.815
andI strongly recommend that,
if you have a chance,

00:07:50.815 --> 00:07:52.190
read The Origin of
Species.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.060
Darwin actually was quite a
good writer.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.043
It's Victorian prose,
so it's a little bit like

00:07:56.043 --> 00:07:56.819
reading Dickens.
 

00:07:56.819 --> 00:08:00.519
But it's good stuff,
he has a nice rolling style.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.470
How did he come to it?
 

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:10.810
Well Darwin was a med school
dropout.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.139
Went to Edinburgh,
didn't like med school;

00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:16.759
loved beetles and became
passionate enough as a

00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:21.697
naturalist to become known,
as a 22-year-old young man,

00:08:21.697 --> 00:08:27.620
as a guy who might be a good
fellow to have on an expedition.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.312
And the British Admiralty was
sending Fitzroy around the world

00:08:31.312 --> 00:08:34.399
to do nautical charts and Darwin
got on the ship.

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:38.386
So at an age not very much
greater, or perhaps even a bit

00:08:38.386 --> 00:08:41.519
younger than some of you,
Darwin sets off.

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:43.639
He's 22 years old.
 

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:46.860
He wants to know how species
form.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.750
He has set himself that goal.
 

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.870
So he's ambitious.
 

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.029
He's set a clear goal.
 

00:08:53.029 --> 00:08:57.726
The goal is to solve one of the
most pressing problems that

00:08:57.726 --> 00:09:02.178
biology has at that time:
where do species come from?

00:09:02.178 --> 00:09:10.940
Now the stimulus that he has is
in part from Charles Lyell,

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.240
the geologist,
who had discovered deep time,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.330
and that convinced Darwin that
there would've been enough time.

00:09:20.429 --> 00:09:23.408
He stops in Argentina.
 

00:09:23.408 --> 00:09:26.138
In the banks of a river in
Argentina he can see giant

00:09:26.138 --> 00:09:28.767
fossil armadillos,
and then right on top of that

00:09:28.767 --> 00:09:31.980
same bank he can see the current
armadillos walking around,

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.059
up on top of the bank.
 

00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:35.211
There they are;
the live ones are right above

00:09:35.211 --> 00:09:35.980
the fossil ones.
 

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.466
They look the same but--I mean,
they look similar--but they're

00:09:40.466 --> 00:09:41.570
not the same.
 

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.629
So there's some connection
there.

00:09:44.629 --> 00:09:48.625
He gets on a horse in Chile and
he rides up into the Andes and

00:09:48.625 --> 00:09:52.293
he sees marine fossils lifted
thousands of feet above sea

00:09:52.293 --> 00:09:55.750
level;
clearly some dynamic process is

00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:00.269
going on that had lifted those
marine fossils up.

00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:04.097
He doesn't know about
continental drift

00:10:04.097 --> 00:10:08.230
yet--right?--but there the
fossils are.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.796
In the harbor at Valparaiso he
sees the effects of an

00:10:10.796 --> 00:10:13.559
earthquake that had happened
just before they arrived.

00:10:13.559 --> 00:10:14.509
It was a big one.
 

00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:17.854
It was probably as large as the
earthquake that recently caused

00:10:17.854 --> 00:10:23.563
the big tsunami in Indonesia--
so it was probably an 8.5,8.6

00:10:23.563 --> 00:10:28.928
earthquake--
and it had caused an uplift in

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:32.389
the harbor of maybe 50 feet.
 

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:36.080
So he began to see the world as
dynamic.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.090
Things hadn't always been the
way they are.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.759
Then he goes to the Galapagos,
and please navigate the

00:10:43.759 --> 00:10:47.152
Galapagos website and have a
look at some of these

00:10:47.152 --> 00:10:48.259
differences.
 

00:10:48.259 --> 00:10:51.212
The thing that Darwin noticed
is that the mockingbirds are

00:10:51.212 --> 00:10:53.129
different on the different
islands.

00:10:53.129 --> 00:10:55.796
If you go to the Galapagos what
you'll notice is that if you

00:10:55.796 --> 00:10:58.005
land on Espanola,
the mockingbirds really want

00:10:58.005 --> 00:11:00.306
your water supply,
and they will hop onto your

00:11:00.306 --> 00:11:03.038
head or your knee to try to get
at your water supply.

00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:04.610
But, in fact,
the mockingbirds all look a

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.375
little bit different on the
different islands,

00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:07.750
and that's what Darwin noticed.
 

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.214
He could also see that that the
marine iguanas look a bit

00:11:10.214 --> 00:11:12.370
different, and the land iguanas
look different.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.293
Interestingly,
he didn't notice the

00:11:14.293 --> 00:11:17.746
differences in the finches,
until he got back to England

00:11:17.746 --> 00:11:20.759
and gave his collection to the
British Museum,

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:24.139
and the ornithologists at the
British Museum came in and said,

00:11:24.139 --> 00:11:27.184
"Hey Darwin,
do you realize that the finches

00:11:27.184 --> 00:11:29.658
on these islands are
different?"

00:11:29.658 --> 00:11:33.851
And that was when he began to
really see how many differences

00:11:33.851 --> 00:11:36.183
could accumulate,
how rapidly,

00:11:36.183 --> 00:11:40.860
when you take a migrant from
Central America and put it on an

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.730
isolated archipelago.
 

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:46.759
So he goes back to London.
 

00:11:46.759 --> 00:11:49.450
He's been onboard ship for
about four years.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.740
He has a problem with
seasickness.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.178
He never again sets foot on a
ship.

00:11:54.178 --> 00:11:57.363
He doesn't want to go near the
water after being four years on

00:11:57.363 --> 00:11:57.990
this ship.
 

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.118
He had a few issues with the
captain too, Fitzroy,

00:12:01.118 --> 00:12:05.011
but mainly it was that he had a
very bad upset stomach onboard

00:12:05.011 --> 00:12:05.970
the Beagle.
 

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.220
He reads the Reverend Malthus
on population growth.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.860
Malthus's book had come out in
1798.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:17.230
Malthus said basically that
populations grow exponentially

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.918
but agriculture grows linearly.
 

00:12:20.918 --> 00:12:24.794
Therefore populations will
always outstrip their resource

00:12:24.794 --> 00:12:25.278
base.
 

00:12:25.278 --> 00:12:29.269
This convinced Darwin that all
organisms are in a competitive

00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:32.726
struggle for resources,
and that that must inevitably

00:12:32.726 --> 00:12:33.788
be the case.
 

00:12:33.788 --> 00:12:37.482
He saw very clearly how
powerful reproduction is at

00:12:37.482 --> 00:12:40.658
generating exponential
population growth.

00:12:40.658 --> 00:12:44.019
We will come back to that in
the ecology portion of the

00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:44.580
course.
 

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:50.046
And we now know that organisms
are in competition really

00:12:50.046 --> 00:12:54.418
essentially not just over food
resources,

00:12:54.418 --> 00:12:58.075
they are in competition over
anything that will get their

00:12:58.075 --> 00:13:00.230
genes into the next generation.
 

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.928
So that can be competition for
mates.

00:13:02.928 --> 00:13:05.024
It can be competition for
nesting sites,

00:13:05.024 --> 00:13:08.278
competition for food;
lots of different things.

00:13:08.278 --> 00:13:12.528
But at any rate this primed
Darwin's thinking.

00:13:12.528 --> 00:13:15.220
So he writes down the idea of
natural selection.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:19.519
It comes to him in 1838;
it's in his notebooks in 1838.

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:23.600
Basically, I'll run through
natural selection in a minute.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:28.404
It's a deceptively simple idea
because the mechanism looks so

00:13:28.404 --> 00:13:32.490
simple, but the consequences are
so wide ranging.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.600
Darwin recognized what the
consequences were.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.740
And he didn't publish
immediately.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:38.918
He did other things.
 

00:13:38.918 --> 00:13:42.570
He went off and he worked five
or six years on barnacles.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:47.918
He wrote down lots of ideas
about things unrelated to

00:13:47.918 --> 00:13:51.874
natural selection,
and he wasn't really jogged out

00:13:51.874 --> 00:13:55.115
of this until a letter arrived
in 1858 from Alfred Russel

00:13:55.115 --> 00:13:58.351
Wallace,
a young British naturalist who

00:13:58.351 --> 00:14:01.312
had,
in a fit of malarial fever,

00:14:01.312 --> 00:14:04.620
had the same idea,
in Indonesia.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.918
And Wallace knew that Darwin
had been thinking about these

00:14:07.918 --> 00:14:10.120
things, and he sent Darwin a
letter.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:15.038
And at that point Darwin,
British gentleman as he was,

00:14:15.038 --> 00:14:18.580
had to decide whether he would
do the sort of gracious,

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.620
honorable thing and let Wallace
have the idea,

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:28.320
or do the honest thing,
which, his colleagues knew,

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.610
was that he had already had the
idea.

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.879
And what they decide upon is
that they will do a joint

00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:33.480
publication.
 

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.599
So if you go to the Biological
Journal of the Linnaean Society

00:14:37.599 --> 00:14:40.150
for 1858,
which is in the Yale Library,

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:43.455
you can look up the back to
back papers by Alfred Russel

00:14:43.455 --> 00:14:46.697
Wallace and Charles Darwin in
which the idea of Natural

00:14:46.697 --> 00:14:48.320
Selection is laid out.
 

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:52.639
And then Darwin rushes his book
into print.

00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:57.219
So he has been working on a
book that was probably going to

00:14:57.219 --> 00:15:01.547
be about 1200 pages long,
and instead he publishes an

00:15:01.547 --> 00:15:03.865
abstract of it,
which he calls "The Origin

00:15:03.865 --> 00:15:08.120
of Species",
which is about 350 pages long.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.615
And it sells out on the first
day, sold all 6000 copies on the

00:15:11.615 --> 00:15:14.480
first day, and has remained in
print ever since.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.000
That's The Beagle.
 

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.844
Darwin slept in a hammock in
the captain's cabin,

00:15:24.844 --> 00:15:29.788
at the back of the ship,
which rocked horribly.

00:15:29.788 --> 00:15:33.865
And that's essentially all I
want to do about the development

00:15:33.865 --> 00:15:35.700
of the idea of Evolution.
 

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:40.017
Basically what I did was I
wanted to give you the feeling

00:15:40.017 --> 00:15:44.643
that there was somebody like you
who went out and knew what a

00:15:44.643 --> 00:15:48.159
deep problem was,
and happened to have the luck

00:15:48.159 --> 00:15:51.990
to get into a special situation
where they were stimulated,

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:56.299
and came up with an idea that
changed the world.

00:15:56.299 --> 00:16:00.690
No reason it can't happen again.
 

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:05.575
So now I'm going to give you a
brief overview of microevolution

00:16:05.575 --> 00:16:07.230
and macroevolution.
 

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:11.168
Here's Natural Selection;
here's Darwin's idea.

00:16:11.168 --> 00:16:14.647
If, in a population,
there is variation in

00:16:14.647 --> 00:16:18.379
reproductive success--what does
that mean?

00:16:18.379 --> 00:16:22.279
Would everybody in the room
raise their hand if they're an

00:16:22.279 --> 00:16:23.169
only child?
 

00:16:23.169 --> 00:16:24.500
Look around.
 

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.720
There are about five or six.
 

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.580
How many of you come from
families with two children?

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:30.259
Lots.
 

00:16:30.259 --> 00:16:32.039
How many with three?
 

00:16:32.039 --> 00:16:32.590
Quite a few.
 

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.288
How many with four?
 

00:16:34.288 --> 00:16:36.167
Quite a few,
but not as many as there with

00:16:36.167 --> 00:16:36.899
only children.
 

00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:38.860
Anybody with five?
 

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:39.769
Yes, a couple.
 

00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:41.620
Anybody with six?
 

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.070
No.
 

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:43.994
If we were, by the way,
in the nineteenth century,

00:16:43.994 --> 00:16:46.350
at this point there would still
be lots of hands going up.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.788
What you've just seen is the
amount of variation in

00:16:48.788 --> 00:16:51.908
reproductive success represented
by the families in this room.

00:16:51.908 --> 00:16:54.640
Variation in reproductive
success basically means that

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.629
different families have
different numbers of offspring,

00:16:57.629 --> 00:17:00.820
or different individuals have
different numbers of offspring.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.369
Then there has to be some
variation in a trait.

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:08.809
How many of you are under 5'5?
 

00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:10.559
Raise your hands.
 

00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:13.779
How many between 5'5 and 6 feet?
 

00:17:13.779 --> 00:17:15.400
How many over 6 feet?
 

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.118
Lots of variation in height in
this room.

00:17:17.118 --> 00:17:19.250
So we got lots of variation in
reproductive success;

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.598
lots of variation in height.
 

00:17:22.598 --> 00:17:25.577
There has to be a non-zero
correlation between reproductive

00:17:25.577 --> 00:17:26.808
success and the trait.
 

00:17:26.808 --> 00:17:28.980
On this particular trait
there's been some research.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.890
Turns out that taller men have
more children.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.624
I don't know whether that's
just an NBA effect or what that

00:17:38.624 --> 00:17:41.670
is but it turns out to be true
in many societies.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.832
So there is a non-zero
correlation between the

00:17:43.832 --> 00:17:45.608
reproductive success and the
trait.

00:17:45.608 --> 00:17:48.210
Then there has to be
heritability for the trait.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:53.650
The heritability of height in
humans is about 80%.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:59.405
So all of the conditions for
natural selection on height are

00:17:59.405 --> 00:18:01.650
present in this room.
 

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:06.230
All you have to do is go out
and have kids and it will

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:07.009
happen.
 

00:18:07.009 --> 00:18:10.318
So if you're ever in doubt
about whether evolution is

00:18:10.318 --> 00:18:13.375
operating in a population,
go back to these basic

00:18:13.375 --> 00:18:14.328
conditions.
 

00:18:14.328 --> 00:18:17.396
You can always decide whether
it's likely to be operating or

00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:17.710
not.
 

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:21.712
We can turn natural selection
off by violating any of these

00:18:21.712 --> 00:18:22.680
four points.
 

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.578
If there's no variation in
reproductive success--

00:18:25.578 --> 00:18:28.768
for example,
if there is lifetime monogamy

00:18:28.768 --> 00:18:32.402
and a one-child policy,
there will be zero-variation in

00:18:32.402 --> 00:18:35.210
reproductive success if
everybody just has one child;

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:37.590
of course some people will
still have zero,

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.029
but that's about as close as
you can get.

00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:43.440
If there's no variation in the
trait--if the trait is like five

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.573
fingers;
there are very few people with

00:18:45.573 --> 00:18:49.480
six fingers;
there are some, but very few.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.163
If there's a non-zero
correlation between reproductive

00:18:52.163 --> 00:18:54.912
success and the trait;
if there is a zero correlation

00:18:54.912 --> 00:18:57.160
between reproductive success and
the trait.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.618
We'll go into all the
conditions for that.

00:18:58.618 --> 00:19:00.250
That results in neutral
evolution.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:01.299
Okay?
 

00:19:01.299 --> 00:19:03.058
Then things just drift.
 

00:19:03.058 --> 00:19:05.068
Well have a whole lecture on
that.

00:19:05.068 --> 00:19:08.832
Or if the trait is not
heritable, if there's no genetic

00:19:08.832 --> 00:19:11.618
component to it,
then it won't evolve.

00:19:11.618 --> 00:19:16.700
So Natural Selection-I wonder
why it's doing that?

00:19:21.568 --> 00:19:27.720
Sorry- Natural Selection does
not necessarily happen.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:32.528
It only happens under certain
conditions.

00:19:32.528 --> 00:19:37.027
Essentially in this picture,
this is what I've just told you

00:19:37.027 --> 00:19:39.009
about Natural Selection.
 

00:19:39.009 --> 00:19:41.911
If there's variation in the
trait, represented on the

00:19:41.911 --> 00:19:43.516
X-axis,
and there's variation in

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:46.092
reproductive success,
based on the Y-axis,

00:19:46.092 --> 00:19:49.630
and there is a correlation
between the two,

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.663
represented by the fact that I
can just about draw a straight

00:19:52.663 --> 00:19:55.854
line between these points,
Natural Selection will occur

00:19:55.854 --> 00:19:58.380
and it will push the trait to
the right.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:02.608
If all of these conditions,
except the correlation,

00:20:02.608 --> 00:20:04.730
occur--so you have variation in
the trait,

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:07.299
variation in reproductive
success but no correlation--

00:20:07.299 --> 00:20:08.630
then you get random drift.
 

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:15.460
And these two situations result
in radically different things.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.875
This situation produces
adaptation, it produces all of

00:20:18.875 --> 00:20:22.099
the fantastic biology that
you're familiar with.

00:20:22.099 --> 00:20:24.509
It's produced meiosis;
it's produced your eye;

00:20:24.509 --> 00:20:28.759
it's produced your brain.
 

00:20:28.759 --> 00:20:31.210
It's extremely powerful.
 

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.720
This situation on the right,
the random drift situation,

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.818
is what connects microevolution
to phylogenetics,

00:20:36.818 --> 00:20:41.005
and it's what allows us to use
variation in DNA sequences to

00:20:41.005 --> 00:20:42.140
infer history.
 

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.500
And I'll get to that.
 

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.750
That statement right now is
opaque.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.548
Don't expect that one to be
transparent at this point.

00:20:48.548 --> 00:20:53.249
But two or three lectures from
now I will go into that in

00:20:53.249 --> 00:20:58.452
detail and you will see that we
need to have a process of drift

00:20:58.452 --> 00:21:03.236
in order to generate a kind of
large-scale regularity that

00:21:03.236 --> 00:21:08.019
gives us timing and relationship
in macroevolution.

00:21:08.019 --> 00:21:13.509
So both are driven by variation
in reproductive success.

00:21:13.509 --> 00:21:18.566
The difference is in whether
there's a correlation between

00:21:18.566 --> 00:21:23.711
the variation of the gene or the
trait and the variation in

00:21:23.711 --> 00:21:25.930
reproductive success.
 

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.375
If we have strong selection,
we can get pretty amazing

00:21:29.375 --> 00:21:29.960
things.
 

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.279
I could illustrate adaptation a
lot of different ways.

00:21:34.279 --> 00:21:39.836
I could do it say with the leaf
cutting ants that were the first

00:21:39.836 --> 00:21:42.258
farmers;
they domesticated a fungus 50

00:21:42.258 --> 00:21:45.390
million years ago and have been
cultivating it ever since.

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:47.460
That would be one way I could
do it.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:51.203
I could do it with the
exquisite morphology of the deep

00:21:51.203 --> 00:21:55.086
sea glass sponges and how
efficient they are at filtering

00:21:55.086 --> 00:21:56.960
stuff out of the water.
 

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.019
I could do it with the design
of a shark's body.

00:22:00.019 --> 00:22:01.410
Lots of stuff.
 

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.286
I'll do it with bats,
in part because when I was a

00:22:04.286 --> 00:22:07.278
Yale undergrad I worked on bats
in this building.

00:22:07.278 --> 00:22:11.000
We had a guy that did research
on bats at that time.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.037
Now a lot of bats are
insectivores,

00:22:14.037 --> 00:22:19.220
and they will hunt moths at
night, in complete darkness.

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.130
They do it with sonar.
 

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:27.269
The bat only weighs about say
50 to 100 grams,

00:22:27.269 --> 00:22:32.449
and it is making a sound that
is as loud as a Metallica

00:22:32.449 --> 00:22:38.106
concert when you're standing
right next to the lead guitar's

00:22:38.106 --> 00:22:39.930
speaker system.
 

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:41.338
Okay?
 

00:22:41.338 --> 00:22:43.567
Or it's as loud,
if you like,

00:22:43.567 --> 00:22:46.990
as a Boeing 747 taking off from
a runway.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:48.220
It's this tiny little creature.
 

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.539
It's making an incredibly loud
sound.

00:22:49.539 --> 00:22:52.338
It's 130 decibels.
 

00:22:52.338 --> 00:22:55.950
It does that because the
intensity of sound,

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.111
the amplitude of sound,
decreases with the square of

00:22:58.111 --> 00:23:00.413
distance,
and it needs to detect an echo

00:23:00.413 --> 00:23:02.028
coming back from the moth.
 

00:23:02.028 --> 00:23:04.250
The echo coming back from the
moth--

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:07.890
which by the way it can pick up
at a distance of about 20 feet--

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:13.750
is about a million times less
loud,

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:18.910
and it's only coming in about
one to two milliseconds later.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:24.630
So imagine, there you are,
you've gone "woo"--

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:31.227
except a lot louder than
that--and milliseconds later you

00:23:31.227 --> 00:23:35.737
hear "click",
and you haven't deafened

00:23:35.737 --> 00:23:36.339
yourself.
 

00:23:36.339 --> 00:23:38.568
That's exquisite.
 

00:23:38.568 --> 00:23:42.228
It has all kinds of physiology
in its ear to hear the returning

00:23:42.228 --> 00:23:44.695
echo,
and it can actually discern

00:23:44.695 --> 00:23:49.430
whether or not it's looking at a
kind of a fuzzy moth or a smooth

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:50.170
beetle.
 

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:54.986
The moth has all kinds of
adaptations to try to get away

00:23:54.986 --> 00:23:56.299
from the bat.
 

00:23:56.299 --> 00:23:57.160
It hears the bat.
 

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.380
The bat's cruising around,
the moth hears the bat.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:03.373
The moth goes into a desperate
spiral, diving towards the

00:24:03.373 --> 00:24:06.440
ground--okay--the bat starts to
swoop in.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:11.769
There is a mite that lives in
the ear of moths.

00:24:11.769 --> 00:24:14.970
I think you begin to understand
the problem that this mite has.

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.720
If the moth gets caught,
the mite will be eaten.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.880
The mite's solution?
 

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.769
It only lives in one ear.
 

00:24:22.769 --> 00:24:25.845
If you collect moths and you
look for mites in their ears,

00:24:25.845 --> 00:24:28.759
you will find that they are
always only on one side.

00:24:28.759 --> 00:24:33.220
So the moth always has a clear
ear so it can hear the bat.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.890
There's stuff like this all
through biology.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:40.996
There's another kind of a bat,
called a Noctilio,

00:24:40.996 --> 00:24:42.380
hunts fish.
 

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:47.969
A Noctilio basically detects
ripples in the water surface,

00:24:47.969 --> 00:24:53.656
and then it swoops down and it
gaffs the fish with its hind

00:24:53.656 --> 00:24:54.538
legs.
 

00:24:54.538 --> 00:24:58.521
It can detect a wire 1/10^(th)
of a millimeter in diameter,

00:24:58.521 --> 00:25:01.885
sticking 1/10^(th) of a
millimeter above the water

00:25:01.885 --> 00:25:02.710
surface.
 

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:06.470
When I was taking care of bats,
I'd never seen a Noctilio.

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.758
I thought, "God,
this must be the greatest bat

00:25:08.758 --> 00:25:09.720
in the world."
 

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.015
About four years ago,
on the Amazon,

00:25:13.015 --> 00:25:17.159
my wife and I went out in a
canoe, at sunset,

00:25:17.159 --> 00:25:21.019
on a lake, just off the Amazon
River.

00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:22.660
It was starting to get dark.
 

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.960
All day long the kingfishers
had been fishing on that lake,

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.694
and during the day the lake had
gotten covered with a lot of

00:25:28.694 --> 00:25:31.410
food that the fish wanted,
but they were afraid of the

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:32.068
kingfishers.
 

00:25:32.068 --> 00:25:35.364
As it got darker the
kingfishers couldn't hunt

00:25:35.364 --> 00:25:39.903
anymore and the whole surface of
the lake dimpled with the fish

00:25:39.903 --> 00:25:42.099
coming up to eat the food.
 

00:25:42.099 --> 00:25:44.038
So their timing was exquisite.
 

00:25:44.038 --> 00:25:47.160
They knew exactly how dark it
had to get before they were

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:47.548
safe.
 

00:25:47.548 --> 00:25:49.848
The fish came up and started to
eat the food.

00:25:49.848 --> 00:25:52.826
At that point--it was just
shortly after sunset--the bat

00:25:52.826 --> 00:25:55.368
falcons were still stationed
around the lake.

00:25:55.368 --> 00:25:57.422
You could see,
up on the trees,

00:25:57.422 --> 00:26:01.526
falcons sitting up on the limbs
and making flights off of the

00:26:01.526 --> 00:26:02.210
limbs.
 

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:06.048
About 15 minutes after the fish
started to eat,

00:26:06.048 --> 00:26:08.450
it got dark enough so that the
bat falcons couldn't hunt

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:12.038
anymore,
and at that point Noctilio came

00:26:12.038 --> 00:26:14.060
out,
and the water was covered with

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.240
hundreds of bats that were
catching the fish.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.130
They were catching the fish
within a meter of us.

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:23.393
Now there are a couple of
things about that story that I

00:26:23.393 --> 00:26:25.470
think, uh, I'd like to
underline.

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:30.112
One is that that entire
community is exquisitely

00:26:30.112 --> 00:26:31.098
adapted.
 

00:26:31.098 --> 00:26:34.991
Every element in it knows when
everything is going on and what

00:26:34.991 --> 00:26:37.545
the risks are,
and what the costs and the

00:26:37.545 --> 00:26:38.630
benefits are.
 

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.834
The other thing is that I had
benefited from a liberal

00:26:41.834 --> 00:26:44.397
education,
and when that bat came out,

00:26:44.397 --> 00:26:47.954
and was flying around a meter
away from my canoe in the

00:26:47.954 --> 00:26:50.584
Amazon,
my life was so much richer

00:26:50.584 --> 00:26:54.318
because I had been waiting to
see it for 40 years.

00:26:54.318 --> 00:26:56.650
I had heard about it in a
course at Yale.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:58.538
I knew where it fit in.
 

00:26:58.538 --> 00:27:01.758
I knew what kinds of
adaptations it had,

00:27:01.758 --> 00:27:04.400
and boy was I happy to see it.
 

00:27:09.839 --> 00:27:14.470
So adaptation can be impressive.
 

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:18.497
Drift is something that
actually appeals to the geeks

00:27:18.497 --> 00:27:19.349
among us.
 

00:27:19.349 --> 00:27:22.180
I have a geeky side too, okay?
 

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:27.248
Drift isn't such a
morphologically or artistically

00:27:27.248 --> 00:27:29.108
beautiful thing.
 

00:27:29.108 --> 00:27:32.250
It's a mathematically beautiful
thing.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:36.577
Drift happens whenever there is
no correlation between

00:27:36.577 --> 00:27:40.253
reproductive success and
variation in a trait,

00:27:40.253 --> 00:27:43.440
and it produces patterns like
this.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:49.180
So here we start off with 20
populations,

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:53.858
and we start them all with a
gene frequency of 0.5,

00:27:53.858 --> 00:27:57.700
and we let meiosis--which is
like flipping a fair coin--

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:01.016
and we let variation and
reproductive success take their

00:28:01.016 --> 00:28:02.906
course,
and we just run these

00:28:02.906 --> 00:28:07.702
populations for 20 generations,
and you can see that there's

00:28:07.702 --> 00:28:13.446
just about an equally likely
distribution of end-states out

00:28:13.446 --> 00:28:14.240
here.
 

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:19.296
So we all start off at 0.5,
and it gets noisy as we go

00:28:19.296 --> 00:28:20.058
along.
 

00:28:20.058 --> 00:28:25.098
So this is an image of the
process of drift,

00:28:25.098 --> 00:28:29.920
and if any of these populations
happens to get up to 1,

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.259
or down to 0,
in terms of gene frequency,

00:28:32.259 --> 00:28:34.988
the process will stop,
because those are absorbing

00:28:34.988 --> 00:28:35.490
states.
 

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:38.156
If the frequency becomes 1,
then everybody's got it and

00:28:38.156 --> 00:28:40.990
there can't be any change,
and if the frequency becomes 0,

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:43.338
then nobody's got it and there
can't be any change.

00:28:43.338 --> 00:28:48.328
So that's what's meant by
absorbing state.

00:28:48.328 --> 00:28:52.898
Now to a first approximation,
whole organism traits are the

00:28:52.898 --> 00:28:55.420
products of Natural Selection.
 

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:58.442
Maybe not in the immediate
past, but usually at some point

00:28:58.442 --> 00:29:01.094
in the history of life,
a whole organism trait will

00:29:01.094 --> 00:29:03.108
have been under Natural
Selection.

00:29:03.108 --> 00:29:07.940
So it will have been shaped and
designed by this process.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:11.852
And to a first approximation,
a lot of DNA sequences have

00:29:11.852 --> 00:29:13.460
been shaped by drift.
 

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:20.523
So we see design in the whole
organism and we see noise in the

00:29:20.523 --> 00:29:25.220
genome--to a rough cut;
lots of exceptions.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:28.970
There are DNA sequences that
have clear selective value;

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:31.150
in fact, there's a whole
literature on this now.

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:35.088
If any of you want to write an
essay on signatures of selection

00:29:35.088 --> 00:29:38.097
in the genome,
you can find lots of stuff on

00:29:38.097 --> 00:29:40.858
that now,
on how to recognize that a

00:29:40.858 --> 00:29:44.838
chunk of genome has recently
been under selection.

00:29:44.838 --> 00:29:48.461
There are whole organism traits
that have no apparent selective

00:29:48.461 --> 00:29:52.170
value;
for example, the chin.

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:57.200
The chin actually is the result
of evolution,

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.298
operating on development,
to take a face,

00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:03.210
which is like that of a gorilla
or a chimpanzee,

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:07.000
which bulged out like this and
essentially flattened it out;

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.150
so that we are vertically much
flatter than a chimp or a

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:14.960
gorilla,
and as a result of this being

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.220
pushed back,
something that was there,

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.500
but kind of covered up,
stuck out.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.690
So that's where the chin came
from.

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:25.170
That doesn't mean chins were
selective.

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:29.034
Now it may be that after they
originated, that there could've

00:30:29.034 --> 00:30:32.769
been a little bit of sexual
selection operating on them.

00:30:32.769 --> 00:30:35.990
But certainly the developmental
process that originally produced

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:37.730
them didn't have to be adaptive.
 

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:40.872
It could just be a byproduct of
something that was going on,

00:30:40.872 --> 00:30:42.470
basically from the mouth up.
 

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:52.578
So the themes of microevolution
are selection and drift.

00:30:52.578 --> 00:30:56.192
Natural selection is driven by
variation in reproductive

00:30:56.192 --> 00:30:56.848
success.
 

00:30:56.848 --> 00:31:00.703
The strength of selection is
measured by the correlation of

00:31:00.703 --> 00:31:03.960
variation in a trait with
reproductive success.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.153
When there's no correlation,
there's no systematic change,

00:31:08.153 --> 00:31:10.730
and then things just drift,
okay?

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:16.078
Now macroevolution;
the big scale process,

00:31:16.078 --> 00:31:17.980
the big picture.
 

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:25.058
Well here are sort of the basic
statements about macroevolution.

00:31:25.058 --> 00:31:27.608
If anybody asks you,
"What does this fancy word

00:31:27.608 --> 00:31:30.259
macroevolution
mean?", tell them basically

00:31:30.259 --> 00:31:31.009
this is it.
 

00:31:31.009 --> 00:31:32.950
There's one tree of life.
 

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.808
Everything on the planet had a
common origin.

00:31:35.808 --> 00:31:38.593
Everything is related to
everything else,

00:31:38.593 --> 00:31:42.907
with the possible exception of
the viruses, which are too small

00:31:42.907 --> 00:31:46.920
for us to decide;
their genomes are too small.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.281
The branch points in the tree,
speciation events--that's when

00:31:50.281 --> 00:31:51.740
new species were formed.
 

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:55.048
This history is marked by
striking major events.

00:31:55.048 --> 00:31:56.500
There have been mass
extinctions.

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.930
There have been meteorite
impacts.

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:02.247
There have been major changes
in the organization of the

00:32:02.247 --> 00:32:04.759
information structure of life.
 

00:32:04.759 --> 00:32:08.347
And the biological disciplines
that you may encounter map onto

00:32:08.347 --> 00:32:09.288
this timeline.
 

00:32:09.288 --> 00:32:14.071
So actually different parts of
biology study different parts of

00:32:14.071 --> 00:32:15.230
this process.
 

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:17.359
The tree looks like this.
 

00:32:17.359 --> 00:32:19.140
This is the large-scale tree.
 

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:23.528
So at this scale,
what you see here are the three

00:32:23.528 --> 00:32:27.184
kingdoms of life,
which are the bacteria,

00:32:27.184 --> 00:32:30.019
the archaea,
and the eukaryotes,

00:32:30.019 --> 00:32:34.050
up here;
the root's at about 3.7 billion

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:36.358
years, not million years.
 

00:32:36.358 --> 00:32:39.990
And at one point a purple
bacterium got into the

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:43.160
eukaryotes and became a
mitochondrion,

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:47.586
and at another point a
cyanobacterium got into various

00:32:47.586 --> 00:32:50.510
plant lineages,
three times,

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:53.589
and became a chloroplast.
 

00:32:53.589 --> 00:32:54.818
So that's the large scale.
 

00:32:54.818 --> 00:32:57.977
And you're probably searching
around on that to find out where

00:32:57.977 --> 00:32:59.599
you,
the most important thing in the

00:32:59.599 --> 00:33:01.560
universe are,
and you're way up here,

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:02.619
on a little twig.
 

00:33:02.619 --> 00:33:04.940
Okay?
 

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:08.930
Now if we blow that up and just
look at the multi-cellular

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:11.845
organisms,
multi-cellularity looks like it

00:33:11.845 --> 00:33:15.338
originated around 800 million to
a billion years ago.

00:33:15.338 --> 00:33:19.555
And these are the fungi,
these are the things we call

00:33:19.555 --> 00:33:22.261
the plants,
multi-cellular plants,

00:33:22.261 --> 00:33:26.694
and then off in this direction
we have got a fairly complicated

00:33:26.694 --> 00:33:30.700
series of branches that end up
with us being up here.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:31.358
Okay?
 

00:33:31.358 --> 00:33:35.858
The things that are--this was
done by Tom Pollard,

00:33:35.858 --> 00:33:40.171
at MCDB, about five years ago,
and at that point the things in

00:33:40.171 --> 00:33:44.130
yellow had genomes that had been
completely sequenced.

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:48.210
Now there are hundreds of
completely sequenced genomes.

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:53.371
So for the first two billion
years of life most of the action

00:33:53.371 --> 00:33:56.210
is down in the basal radiation.
 

00:33:56.210 --> 00:34:00.569
So going on with bacteria,
archaea and eukaryote ancestor;

00:34:00.569 --> 00:34:05.640
single-celled things.
 

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:09.766
At that scale--we're just way
up at a small twig on the

00:34:09.766 --> 00:34:13.510
tip--and symbiotic events
brought mitochondria and

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:16.489
chloroplasts into eukaryotic
cells.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:18.914
Already this is telling you
something interesting about

00:34:18.914 --> 00:34:19.409
yourself.
 

00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:21.309
You are a community of genomes.
 

00:34:21.309 --> 00:34:23.280
You are not a unitary genome.
 

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.130
You've got that mitochondria in
you.

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:31.501
The main themes are basically
that the speciation events that

00:34:31.501 --> 00:34:34.407
have occurred,
particularly over the last

00:34:34.407 --> 00:34:38.465
billion years or so,
have created a tree of life

00:34:38.465 --> 00:34:44.539
that describes the relationships
of everything on the planet.

00:34:44.539 --> 00:34:46.733
Systematic biology,
phylogenetics,

00:34:46.733 --> 00:34:50.123
tries to infer the history of
life by studying those

00:34:50.123 --> 00:34:51.320
relationships.
 

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.626
And there's a real deep issue
here of how do we infer the

00:34:54.626 --> 00:34:55.039
tree?
 

00:34:55.039 --> 00:34:57.853
The tree--organisms don't come
with a barcode on their

00:34:57.853 --> 00:35:00.349
foreheads telling us who they
are related to.

00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:03.599
We have to try to figure out
who they're related to,

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:06.179
and when we understand the
relationships,

00:35:06.179 --> 00:35:10.708
then we know the history,
because the relationships

00:35:10.708 --> 00:35:12.610
define the history.
 

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:18.389
So we work with hypotheses
about history,

00:35:18.389 --> 00:35:21.628
and we test these hypotheses
against each other and try to

00:35:21.628 --> 00:35:25.094
come up with the one that's most
consistent with the data that

00:35:25.094 --> 00:35:25.889
we've got.
 

00:35:25.889 --> 00:35:29.974
And they give us a historical
framework within which we can

00:35:29.974 --> 00:35:32.300
then interpret what's happened.
 

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.449
There are major events that
have happened.

00:35:34.449 --> 00:35:38.670
Briefly these are they.
 

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:44.599
Life originates about 3.6 to
3.9 billion years ago.

00:35:44.599 --> 00:35:48.512
And, by the way,
it seems to have originated

00:35:48.512 --> 00:35:50.059
fairly quickly.
 

00:35:50.059 --> 00:35:53.179
Within probably about 100
million years--

00:35:53.179 --> 00:35:54.960
see I'm being an evolutionary
biologist again--

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.530
within just a hundred million
years,

00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:01.527
uh, after water could exist on
the surface of the planet in

00:36:01.527 --> 00:36:04.068
liquid form--
so following the meteorite

00:36:04.068 --> 00:36:06.001
bombardment,
when the surface of the planet

00:36:06.001 --> 00:36:07.809
cools down enough for water to
be liquid--

00:36:07.809 --> 00:36:10.889
life probably originates pretty
quickly.

00:36:10.889 --> 00:36:14.184
And arguably,
within the first hundred

00:36:14.184 --> 00:36:18.369
generations, the first parasites
were around.

00:36:18.369 --> 00:36:20.750
So those things happened pretty
quickly.

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:26.755
Then eukaryotes and meiosis,
which is how a biologist refers

00:36:26.755 --> 00:36:31.030
to organized sex,
happened about 1.5 to 2.5

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:34.347
billion years ago;
multi-cellularity,

00:36:34.347 --> 00:36:37.820
which gives us developmental
biology, about a billion years

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:38.239
ago.
 

00:36:38.239 --> 00:36:43.190
All the major body plans for
animals appear to have,

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:45.460
with the exception perhaps of
the, uh,

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:48.050
jellyfish and a few of their
relatives,

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:52.974
they all seem to have
originated about 550 million

00:36:52.974 --> 00:36:54.179
years ago.
 

00:36:54.179 --> 00:36:59.012
There was a near loss of life
on the planet in the Permian

00:36:59.012 --> 00:37:00.539
mass extinction.
 

00:37:00.539 --> 00:37:03.829
We will study that later in the
course.

00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:06.106
You're welcome to write an
essay on mass extinctions if you

00:37:06.106 --> 00:37:10.077
want to;
you know, big death is kind of

00:37:10.077 --> 00:37:11.268
exciting.
 

00:37:11.268 --> 00:37:15.184
It seems to have occurred
basically by a process of

00:37:15.184 --> 00:37:17.219
poisoning of the oceans.
 

00:37:17.219 --> 00:37:23.625
The flowers radiate about
between 65 and 135 million years

00:37:23.625 --> 00:37:24.300
ago.
 

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:27.512
Language is important because
once language occurs,

00:37:27.512 --> 00:37:31.304
then we have an independent
kind of information transmission

00:37:31.304 --> 00:37:35.329
from generation to generation;
we get cultural transmission.

00:37:35.329 --> 00:37:41.750
That's probably about
60-100,000 years old;

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:46.739
at least with syntax and
complicated information storage.

00:37:46.739 --> 00:37:49.380
Writing is only about 6000
years old.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:52.860
And of course the important
stuff is quite recent.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:57.235
So this is a view of life that
goes from bacteria to dinosaurs

00:37:57.235 --> 00:38:01.739
to rock and roll;
and that all can be studied

00:38:01.739 --> 00:38:05.230
with evolutionary principles.
 

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:07.789
How do the biological
disciplines map onto this?

00:38:07.789 --> 00:38:12.635
Well microbiology and
biochemistry try to study things

00:38:12.635 --> 00:38:15.380
that are common to all life.
 

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:18.625
That means that the same
chemical reactions that go on in

00:38:18.625 --> 00:38:20.768
bacteria go on in the human
liver,

00:38:20.768 --> 00:38:25.519
and that's about one-and-a-half
to four billion years old.

00:38:25.519 --> 00:38:26.768
Okay?
 

00:38:26.768 --> 00:38:31.784
Genetics and cell biology study
stuff that follows the

00:38:31.784 --> 00:38:35.190
evolutionary invention of
meiosis;

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:36.739
to a large degree.
 

00:38:36.739 --> 00:38:40.472
There is bacterial genetics,
but eukaryotic genetics is

00:38:40.472 --> 00:38:44.068
something which is studying
things that are about 1.5

00:38:44.068 --> 00:38:45.590
billion years old.
 

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:48.516
Developmental biology and
general physiology,

00:38:48.516 --> 00:38:51.110
those are multi-cellular
disciplines;

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:54.050
they depend upon the existence
of a multi-cellular organism.

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:58.219
That thing didn't come along
until about a billion years ago.

00:38:58.219 --> 00:39:01.056
Neurobiology,
you need a complex--you need

00:39:01.056 --> 00:39:05.139
cephalization--you need to have
a complex nervous system.

00:39:05.139 --> 00:39:10.260
That studies phenomena that are
probably about 500 to 600

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.090
million years old.
 

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:13.789
Same for behavior.
 

00:39:13.789 --> 00:39:17.000
There are several
anthropologists in the class.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.786
You guys are studying things
that probably originated along

00:39:20.786 --> 00:39:23.853
our branch of the tree,
within the last 15 to 20

00:39:23.853 --> 00:39:25.030
million years.
 

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:30.045
So there is a temporal assembly
of biology, as a discipline,

00:39:30.045 --> 00:39:33.869
as well as there is of life,
on the planet.

00:39:33.869 --> 00:39:36.717
So the key concepts from this
lecture are that there are two

00:39:36.717 --> 00:39:38.360
kinds of explanation in biology.
 

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:41.666
One is the proximate or
mechanical question,

00:39:41.666 --> 00:39:45.742
which is answered by studying
how molecules and larger

00:39:45.742 --> 00:39:47.280
structures work.
 

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.079
Those are basically physical
and chemical explanations.

00:39:51.079 --> 00:39:53.402
And then there are the
evolutionary questions,

00:39:53.402 --> 00:39:55.260
which is why does the thing
exist;

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.730
why did it get designed this
way?

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:59.260
And that could be answered
either through selection or

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.503
through history;
or the best way to do it is to

00:40:02.503 --> 00:40:05.760
use both and combine those
explanations.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.536
The thing that distinguishes
biology from physics and

00:40:08.536 --> 00:40:10.300
chemistry is Natural Selection.
 

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:13.793
This is not a principle that
you can find in a physics

00:40:13.793 --> 00:40:16.300
textbook or in a chemistry
textbook.

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:19.717
This is something that is a
general principle that actually

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:22.369
applies to lots of things
besides biology,

00:40:22.369 --> 00:40:26.099
but it's not contained within
physics and chemistry.

00:40:26.099 --> 00:40:29.960
And there is a pattern in
biology that unites biology with

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.940
geology and astronomy,
and that's history.

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:36.657
So there is an important
element of historical thought in

00:40:36.657 --> 00:40:40.382
evolutionary biology,
as well as the more abstract

00:40:40.382 --> 00:40:44.418
action of natural selection on
designing organisms for

00:40:44.418 --> 00:40:49.369
reproductive success and shaping
changes and gene frequencies.

00:40:49.369 --> 00:40:51.909
Now I want to end the lecture
by telling you something

00:40:51.909 --> 00:40:52.579
astonishing.
 

00:40:52.579 --> 00:40:55.141
I won't always be able to tell
you something astonishing in

00:40:55.141 --> 00:40:55.849
every lecture.
 

00:40:55.849 --> 00:40:58.583
But one of the great privileges
of teaching Introductory

00:40:58.583 --> 00:41:00.726
Biology,
or being in an Intro Bio class,

00:41:00.726 --> 00:41:03.815
is that there are certain big
things that never get discussed

00:41:03.815 --> 00:41:04.280
again.
 

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.329
Okay?
 

00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:06.070
This is one of them.
 

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:13.809
We are continuous with non-life.
 

00:41:13.809 --> 00:41:16.139
Here's how I'm going to
convince you of that.

00:41:16.139 --> 00:41:18.500
Think of your mother.
 

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.699
Now think of her mother.
 

00:41:20.699 --> 00:41:25.639
Now think of your mother's
mother's mother.

00:41:25.639 --> 00:41:28.106
Now I want you to go through a
process like you've done in math

00:41:28.106 --> 00:41:30.769
where you do an inductive proof;
you just go back.

00:41:30.769 --> 00:41:32.530
Just let that process go.
 

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:33.489
Okay?
 

00:41:33.489 --> 00:41:35.300
Back you go in time.
 

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.489
Speed it up now.
 

00:41:36.489 --> 00:41:37.000
Okay?
 

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.150
We're back at ten million.
 

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:39.349
Now we're at a hundred million.
 

00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:41.530
Now we're at a billion years.
 

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:44.309
Now we're at 3.9 billion years.
 

00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:48.179
Every step of the way there has
been a parent.

00:41:48.179 --> 00:41:54.119
3.9 billion years ago something
extremely interesting happens.

00:41:54.119 --> 00:41:57.846
You pass through the origin of
life, and there's no parent

00:41:57.846 --> 00:41:58.500
anymore.
 

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.599
At that point you are connected
to abiotic matter.

00:42:02.599 --> 00:42:08.050
Now this means that not only
does the tree of life connect

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:12.449
you to all the living things on
the planet,

00:42:12.449 --> 00:42:17.389
but the origin of life connects
you to the entire universe.

00:42:17.389 --> 00:42:20.449
That's a deep thought.
 

00:42:20.449 --> 00:42:24.768
Every element in your body,
which is heavier than iron,

00:42:24.768 --> 00:42:29.250
and you need a number of them,
was synthesized in a nova,

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:30.690
uh, supernova.
 

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:35.811
The planet that you're sitting
on is a secondary recycling of

00:42:35.811 --> 00:42:39.550
supernova material,
and your bodies are constructed

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:43.150
of that stuff and they use it in
some of their most important

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.929
processes.
 

00:42:43.929 --> 00:42:49.483
So the vision that evolutionary
biology gives you is not only

00:42:49.483 --> 00:42:54.851
the practical one of how to
think about and analyze how and

00:42:54.851 --> 00:42:58.717
why questions in biology,
it's also a more general

00:42:58.717 --> 00:43:00.440
statement about the human
condition,

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.840
and I hope it's one that you'll
have time to reflect on.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.860
Next time we'll do basic
genetics.

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.695
Professor Charles
Bailyn: We've been talking

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:09.215
about the expansion of the
Universe and in answer--I want

00:00:09.215 --> 00:00:14.301
to follow up on something I said
kind of in answer to a question

00:00:14.301 --> 00:00:18.982
last time, which is that it
turns out that the expansion of

00:00:18.982 --> 00:00:24.310
the Universe alone doesn't
require you to have a Big Bang.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.337
There are other explanations,
or in particular,

00:00:27.337 --> 00:00:31.409
one other class of explanation,
which is compatible with the

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:35.277
observation of the expanding
Universe, but doesn't exactly

00:00:35.277 --> 00:00:38.346
lead to a Big Bang,
in the sense that we think of

00:00:38.346 --> 00:00:40.354
it today.
And so, I want to talk about

00:00:40.354 --> 00:00:43.960
these alternatives.
This is Frontiers and

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.130
Controversies as of 1950.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.260
In 1920, you'll recall,
they were worried about whether

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.660
the spiral nebulae were island
galaxies of their own,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.155
or not.
That was settled by Hubble's

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:04.825
observation.
In the 1950s,

00:01:04.825 --> 00:01:08.659
it had become clear that it
really is true that the Universe

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.124
is expanding.
But there were two categories

00:01:12.124 --> 00:01:17.140
of explanation that were being
put forward to explain that,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.560
and deciding which is which was
the current big topic of the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.820
day.
So, the Universe expands.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.450
And what do we make of this
fact?

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.368
Well, one option is the Big
Bang, what we now call the Big

00:01:36.368 --> 00:01:41.200
Bang, which, as I've mentioned,
implies that in the past,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.583
everything was closer together.
It was denser,

00:01:45.583 --> 00:01:49.741
and that creates other changes.
If things get denser,

00:01:49.741 --> 00:01:51.825
they also get hotter,
you may remember from

00:01:51.825 --> 00:01:54.832
chemistry.
So, this implies in the past

00:01:54.832 --> 00:01:58.629
things were different from how
they are now.

00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:06.658
They were denser,
hotter, and that in the future,

00:02:06.658 --> 00:02:15.268
it'll go the other way.
Things will become sparser and

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:18.099
cooler.
And there may be other changes

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.120
associated with this.
There may be different kinds of

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.625
galaxies in the past from now
and different kinds of galaxies

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:27.430
now, as compared to the future,
and so forth.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.876
But the Universe is a place
whose bulk properties can change

00:02:32.876 --> 00:02:40.340
in time.
So, things change in time.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.226
And the implication is that you
can extrapolate this back to an

00:02:45.226 --> 00:02:48.930
initial singularity--that there
was a moment,

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.354
at some point in the past,
where all currently existing

00:02:53.354 --> 00:02:56.550
space was piled up in a single
point.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.507
The way I talked about this
last time was that the scale

00:03:02.507 --> 00:03:07.490
factor was equal to zero,
and so, there is this

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.039
implication of an initial
singularity.

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:15.266
Now, the initial singularity is
not the kind of thing that can

00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:18.330
be verified scientifically,
because all the physical laws

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.391
break down the same way they do
in the singularity inside a

00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:23.231
black hole,
or in an event horizon,

00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:25.279
or something like that.
But nevertheless,

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:29.795
that's the implication.
That's the extrapolation of

00:03:29.795 --> 00:03:33.035
this set of ideas.
But, at least,

00:03:33.035 --> 00:03:35.765
at the time,
that was not the only set of

00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:38.699
ideas that could explain this
expansion.

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:44.235
There was an alternative,
which was described as the

00:03:44.235 --> 00:03:47.899
"steady state."
I should say that both of these

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:51.303
names were given to these ideas
by people who supported the

00:03:51.303 --> 00:03:55.183
"steady state."
Big Bang was--that phrase was

00:03:55.183 --> 00:04:01.415
used as an insult by the "steady
state" people to make fun of the

00:04:01.415 --> 00:04:05.080
ideas of the Big Bang,
which we now actually know to

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.906
be correct.
And that's why that particular

00:04:07.906 --> 00:04:11.689
phrase is, in a way,
so misleading--that they were

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:16.400
deliberately trying to obscure
and insult some of the ideas in

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.886
the Big Bang.
From time to time,

00:04:18.886 --> 00:04:22.541
astronomical organizations and
popular magazines run contests

00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:26.135
to rename the great theory and
come up with some better name

00:04:26.135 --> 00:04:29.911
that won't give you in your mind
the impression of an explosion

00:04:29.911 --> 00:04:32.470
coming out from some central
point.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.440
And people send in suggestions
and it never gets anywhere.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.979
We're stuck with the Big Bang.
But it is good to remember that

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.746
it was named by its opponents,
who supported the "steady

00:04:42.746 --> 00:04:45.029
state."
So, how would this work?

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:52.097
The central idea here is that
the Universe expands,

00:04:52.097 --> 00:05:01.002
but then, new matter and energy
is created to fill in the voids,

00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:06.464
as the Universe expands.
So, sure, all galaxies are

00:05:06.464 --> 00:05:09.006
moving away from us.
But new galaxies are being

00:05:09.006 --> 00:05:11.199
created where the old galaxies
used to be.

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:17.046
And the consequence of that is
that the past and the future

00:05:17.046 --> 00:05:21.180
both have similar bulk
characteristics.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.357
The density,
the overall density,

00:05:23.357 --> 00:05:26.549
is the same.
And other characteristics are

00:05:26.549 --> 00:05:30.024
the same, because as things move
further away,

00:05:30.024 --> 00:05:34.579
you've simply replaced them
with other things like them.

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:38.711
And so, now,
you have to kind of invent some

00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:42.170
way of creating matter and
energy.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.680
But that's not nearly as bad as
creating a whole Universe,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.350
which is what you have to do in
the case of the Big Bang.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.116
So, in this case,
the past and the future are the

00:05:54.116 --> 00:05:56.312
same.
It also implies that the

00:05:56.312 --> 00:05:59.822
Universe is eternal in contrast
to the Big Bang,

00:05:59.822 --> 00:06:02.660
where there is this initial
moment,

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.728
which one then instantly asks,
well, how did that happen and

00:06:05.728 --> 00:06:08.280
what happened before it?
So, we get around that.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.660
This is an eternal process.
And it's also infinite.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.841
And so, we don't have to start
asking these awkward questions

00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:20.350
about what's outside the
Universe.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.664
And so, people found this,
in some ways,

00:06:22.664 --> 00:06:24.030
much more satisfying.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.530
And so, there were these two
quite different explanations of

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.259
the observed fact that the
Universe was expanding.

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:40.029
Now, the historians of science,
who have studied this

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:44.307
controversy, some of whom make
the claim that which side you

00:06:44.307 --> 00:06:47.711
ended up on in the 1950s,
before there was a lot of

00:06:47.711 --> 00:06:49.689
evidence either way,
this was kind of a

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:52.447
philosophical rather than a
scientific question at the

00:06:52.447 --> 00:06:54.529
time--that which side you ended
up,

00:06:54.529 --> 00:07:01.206
here, depended largely on your
religious beliefs or lack

00:07:01.206 --> 00:07:04.113
thereof.
And they document this--a lot

00:07:04.113 --> 00:07:07.676
of the work on the Big Bang and
a lot of the supporters of the

00:07:07.676 --> 00:07:09.953
Big Bang were,
as I mentioned last time,

00:07:09.953 --> 00:07:12.001
Catholics.
In one important case,

00:07:12.001 --> 00:07:14.130
this guy Lemaitre,
who worked out all the

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.260
equations, was in fact a
Catholic priest,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.389
also a physicist in his spare
time.

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:23.025
And this is a nice kind of
idea, because from that point of

00:07:23.025 --> 00:07:27.899
view--because it gives you this
initial moment of creation,

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:31.884
which is--if you're a religious
person, it's relatively easy to

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:35.290
come up with a reason why that
might have happened.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.012
On the other hand,
a lot of the scientists,

00:07:38.012 --> 00:07:41.383
particularly in Britain,
where the "steady state" was

00:07:41.383 --> 00:07:44.754
largely developed,
were of a kind of atheistic or

00:07:44.754 --> 00:07:47.799
agnostic turn of mind,
and they didn't like this

00:07:47.799 --> 00:07:50.884
initial singularity.
And they liked the idea of an

00:07:50.884 --> 00:07:53.800
eternal infinite Universe,
as actually Einstein did,

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.648
too, because you didn't have to
have a creation event,

00:07:57.648 --> 00:08:01.787
and you didn't have to invoke
the kinds of ideas that come

00:08:01.787 --> 00:08:05.937
along with that.
And there's some dispute over

00:08:05.937 --> 00:08:09.750
how much this really mattered to
people.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:14.076
But what was clear is in the
1950s, this was not a question

00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:18.029
for which there was scientific
evidence either way.

00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:20.019
And so, what the scientific
evidence said was that the

00:08:20.019 --> 00:08:21.893
Universe expanded.
And then, you could follow

00:08:21.893 --> 00:08:23.858
either of these arrows.
Interestingly,

00:08:23.858 --> 00:08:27.109
however, these two hypotheses
make quite different

00:08:27.109 --> 00:08:31.089
predictions, which in the end,
turned out to be testable.

00:08:31.089 --> 00:08:35.608
And, in particular,
what it predicted,

00:08:35.608 --> 00:08:43.180
if the Big Bang makes this very
strong prediction that the past

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:48.310
is fundamentally
different-looking from the

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.452
present.
Now, over the course of a human

00:08:51.452 --> 00:08:54.039
lifetime, this isn't going to
make a lot of difference.

00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:58.123
The galaxies don't get that
much further away from us in

00:08:58.123 --> 00:09:02.463
twenty or thirty years.
But one can actually look into

00:09:02.463 --> 00:09:06.519
the past by looking at things
that are far away.

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:09.070
This is because the speed of
light is finite.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:11.679
When we look at the Sun,
we don't see the Sun as it is

00:09:11.679 --> 00:09:13.756
right now.
We see the Sun as it was eight

00:09:13.756 --> 00:09:16.481
minutes ago, when the light
started to travel toward us,

00:09:16.481 --> 00:09:18.809
because the Sun is eight light
minutes away.

00:09:18.809 --> 00:09:22.625
If we look at Alpha Centauri,
the nearest star other than the

00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:26.249
Sun, if Alpha Centauri blew up
or disappeared or something

00:09:26.249 --> 00:09:28.574
right now,
we wouldn't know about it for

00:09:28.574 --> 00:09:30.899
four years because it's four
light years away.

00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:35.298
Similarly, if we look at a
galaxy that's 10 megaparsecs

00:09:35.298 --> 00:09:40.185
away, a parsec is three light
years, so a megaparsec is three

00:09:40.185 --> 00:09:44.186
million light years.
Some galaxy that's 10

00:09:44.186 --> 00:09:48.670
megaparsecs away,
that's 30 million light years

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.139
away.
So, we're seeing it not as it

00:09:51.139 --> 00:09:53.470
is, but as it was 30 million
years ago.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.270
Now, it turns out that in the
course of cosmic time,

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.962
a few million years here or
there doesn't make any

00:09:58.962 --> 00:10:03.165
difference to anybody.
But once you get into billions,

00:10:03.165 --> 00:10:07.935
now you're talking cosmic time.
And so, if you look at things

00:10:07.935 --> 00:10:11.879
that are billions of light years
away, that turns out to be a

00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:16.019
substantial fraction of the age
of the Universe predicted by the

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:18.196
Big Bang.
We'll get back a little later

00:10:18.196 --> 00:10:20.580
in this lecture to how you
determine what the age of the

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.442
Universe is supposed to be.
But if you go back a

00:10:23.442 --> 00:10:27.115
substantial fraction of the age
of the Universe,

00:10:27.115 --> 00:10:30.710
if you look back over distances
that great,

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.324
then you predict that you ought
to see things that look

00:10:34.324 --> 00:10:37.269
different from the galaxies you
see today,

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:40.222
because the Universe at that
time was denser and hotter,

00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:42.529
and the galaxies were younger
on average,

00:10:42.529 --> 00:10:45.850
and you ought to be able to see
some kind of differences.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:52.252
So, the past is different from
the present, and this is

00:10:52.252 --> 00:10:59.009
observable through this concept
of the "lookback time."

00:10:59.009 --> 00:11:01.923
Just the fact that the further
away something is,

00:11:01.923 --> 00:11:05.019
the longer it's taken the light
to travel to you.

00:11:05.019 --> 00:11:07.389
And so, you're actually seeing
things not as they are right

00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:08.820
now, but as they are in the
past.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.121
And so, you can imagine a great
research project where you sort

00:11:12.121 --> 00:11:14.997
of look at nearby galaxies to
see how things are in the

00:11:14.997 --> 00:11:17.020
current day.
Then, you look at really,

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.268
really distant ones,
some substantial fraction of

00:11:19.268 --> 00:11:21.974
the age of the Universe ago,
and you ask yourself the

00:11:21.974 --> 00:11:25.005
question, "Are those galaxies
the same as the galaxies that

00:11:25.005 --> 00:11:26.356
exist today,
or are they,

00:11:26.356 --> 00:11:27.630
in some sense,
different?"

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:31.106
So that's a testable prediction.
There's also a testable

00:11:31.106 --> 00:11:33.947
prediction on this side,
which is that you ought to

00:11:33.947 --> 00:11:37.412
actually be able to find these
places where the new matter and

00:11:37.412 --> 00:11:40.637
energy is being created,
because that's a constant

00:11:40.637 --> 00:11:42.590
ongoing process.
It has to be,

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.789
because it's got to fill in the
empty spaces left behind by the

00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:52.248
expanding galaxies.
So, the prediction over here is

00:11:52.248 --> 00:11:59.289
that there exist places of
matter and energy creation.

00:11:59.289 --> 00:12:01.690
So, this is potentially
testable.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.466
And in the 1960s,
evidence was actually found

00:12:04.466 --> 00:12:08.062
that kind of decided this
question, which is why we now no

00:12:08.062 --> 00:12:10.650
longer believe in the "steady
state."

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.400
And two things happened;
actually, there were a number

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.619
of things that happened.
But one of them was the

00:12:17.619 --> 00:12:23.679
discovery of what were called
"quasars."

00:12:23.679 --> 00:12:29.876
These are now known to be
accreting supermassive black

00:12:29.876 --> 00:12:34.670
holes, but they didn't know
that, then.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.960
So, this is in the 1960s.

00:12:39.419 --> 00:12:41.887
That's what we think they are
now, but they didn't know it

00:12:41.887 --> 00:12:45.085
then.
All they knew is that they had

00:12:45.085 --> 00:12:50.200
discovered a great source of
huge amounts of energy.

00:12:54.299 --> 00:12:58.106
And you'd think that this would
be a very good thing--some kind

00:12:58.106 --> 00:13:01.483
of unknown energy source would
be just the thing for the

00:13:01.483 --> 00:13:04.440
"steady state" people,
because that's what they needed.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.944
They needed some kind of source
of mass energy creation,

00:13:07.944 --> 00:13:11.129
and indeed, that was claimed
for a little while.

00:13:11.129 --> 00:13:14.956
The main characteristic of
these things is that they have

00:13:14.956 --> 00:13:19.600
very high redshifts,
which implies very large

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:27.060
distances, because velocity is
proportional to distance.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.951
That's the Hubble Law.
Everybody agreed that the

00:13:28.951 --> 00:13:30.974
Hubble Law was right.
So, these things were known to

00:13:30.974 --> 00:13:33.320
be large distances away.
And so, if you're a "steady

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.720
state" person,
you say, well,

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.736
that's great.
If they're so far away,

00:13:36.736 --> 00:13:39.910
they must be incredibly bright,
otherwise we wouldn't be able

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:43.190
to see them, and there's our
energy source that we require.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.480
If you're a Big Bang person,
what you say is,

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.603
now we've finally found a bunch
of things that are really far

00:13:48.603 --> 00:13:50.529
away and we can ask the
question,

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:53.897
"Are things that are that far
away the same as in the local

00:13:53.897 --> 00:13:55.929
Universe, or are they
different?"

00:13:55.929 --> 00:14:02.895
And what it turned out--one of
the very first things that was

00:14:02.895 --> 00:14:09.629
discovered is that there were
many more quasars in the past

00:14:09.629 --> 00:14:13.601
than there are now.
And so, whatever they are,

00:14:13.601 --> 00:14:16.556
supermassive black holes or
whatever hypothesis you have for

00:14:16.556 --> 00:14:17.858
these things,
it turns out,

00:14:17.858 --> 00:14:20.520
they're dying out.
There were more of them in the

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.039
past then there are now.
They were brighter.

00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:30.473
And so, here is an example of a
significant change in the

00:14:30.473 --> 00:14:37.507
composition of the Universe,
which is the thing that's

00:14:37.507 --> 00:14:43.169
predicted by the Big Bang.
And so, although initially,

00:14:43.169 --> 00:14:47.090
it looked like quasars might be
helpful to the "steady state,"

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:49.401
as soon as they started to get
enough of them so you could do

00:14:49.401 --> 00:14:50.750
these kinds of statistical
tests,

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.993
it became the first really
strong evidence that the

00:14:53.993 --> 00:14:57.406
Universe was changing in time.
This was not the only thing

00:14:57.406 --> 00:14:59.090
that was discovered in the
1960s.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:05.138
Another thing is the so-called
cosmic microwave background,

00:15:05.138 --> 00:15:10.039
and we'll talk much more about
that later on.

00:15:10.039 --> 00:15:16.506
Right now, I just want to say
that what this is,

00:15:16.506 --> 00:15:24.486
is it's radiation that was
created--that was generated when

00:15:24.486 --> 00:15:31.090
the Universe was much denser
than it is now,

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:37.867
much hotter than it is now.
In fact, it comes from

00:15:37.867 --> 00:15:40.610
radiation emitted by ionized
hydrogen.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:44.471
So, this is when the whole
Universe was at 10,000 degrees

00:15:44.471 --> 00:15:48.264
or so Kelvin--obviously much
hotter than the Universe is

00:15:48.264 --> 00:15:51.819
right now, and much smoother.
All this hydrogen,

00:15:51.819 --> 00:15:55.871
rather than being locked up in
individual stars or in--and

00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:59.070
stars concentrated in individual
galaxies,

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:01.859
all this hydrogen was very
smoothly distributed around

00:16:01.859 --> 00:16:04.490
space.
And so, this came from a

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:08.910
time--this radiation,
which you can easily detect

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:12.409
with radio telescopes and the
like,

00:16:12.409 --> 00:16:15.451
comes from a time when then
Universe was much denser,

00:16:15.451 --> 00:16:18.200
hotter, and smoother than it is
today--again,

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:23.230
in accordance with the
prediction of the Big Bang.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:26.340
So, this provided very strong
support for the Big Bang.

00:16:30.759 --> 00:16:34.236
And the discoverers of this
have got--there have been Nobel

00:16:34.236 --> 00:16:37.892
prizes given out on a regular
basis for discoveries related to

00:16:37.892 --> 00:16:41.779
the cosmic microwave background.
And as I say, we'll come back.

00:16:41.779 --> 00:16:44.649
I'll talk about that at some
length later on.

00:16:44.649 --> 00:16:49.641
Another thing that was
discovered is that the Universe

00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:53.974
is pretty clearly,
mostly, 3/4 hydrogen and 1/4

00:16:53.974 --> 00:16:57.009
helium.
Just about every cosmic object

00:16:57.009 --> 00:17:00.207
you see, not the Earth,
but the Solar System as a

00:17:00.207 --> 00:17:03.651
whole, has those proportions.
And all stars have these

00:17:03.651 --> 00:17:06.930
proportions and all galaxies
consist of stars that have these

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:08.626
proportions.
And it turns out,

00:17:08.626 --> 00:17:10.740
this could be explained by the
Big Bang.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:17.130
When it was denser,
hotter, and smoother in the

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:23.382
early Universe,
it was hot enough for hydrogen

00:17:23.382 --> 00:17:28.940
fusion--hydrogen fusion into
helium.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.765
But it didn't last very long
because the Universe was

00:17:31.765 --> 00:17:34.531
expanding and cooling,
and you need to have very high

00:17:34.531 --> 00:17:36.819
temperatures in order to have
hydrogen fusion.

00:17:36.819 --> 00:17:39.267
That's why it can only happen
in the center of the Sun,

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:41.849
or in an atomic bomb explosion,
or something like that.

00:17:41.849 --> 00:17:46.366
And so, the Universe,
for about three minutes,

00:17:46.366 --> 00:17:50.180
was hot enough for hydrogen to
fuse.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:53.515
And if you ask yourself,
what fraction of the hydrogen

00:17:53.515 --> 00:17:57.101
fused during the time the
Universe was hot enough for that

00:17:57.101 --> 00:17:59.609
to occur,
the answer turns out to be,

00:17:59.609 --> 00:18:03.302
about a quarter of it--in exact
agreement with the currently

00:18:03.302 --> 00:18:07.119
observed fractions of hydrogen
and helium in the Universe.

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:11.000
So, this is in first three
minutes.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.868
There's a famous popular book
from the 1980s called The

00:18:13.868 --> 00:18:16.132
First Three Minutes,
which discusses this,

00:18:16.132 --> 00:18:20.531
by Steven Weinberg.
In the first three minutes,

00:18:20.531 --> 00:18:27.375
one quarter of hydrogen fuses
into helium, and afterwards,

00:18:27.375 --> 00:18:34.940
no more, because it's too cool
for these reactions to occur.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:39.960
So, that was another piece of
evidence that the Big Bang was

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:44.640
the right explanation and the
"steady state" was not.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.556
Yes, question?
Student: Is it actually

00:18:46.556 --> 00:18:47.831
three minutes or is that just
[Inaudible]

00:18:47.831 --> 00:18:49.170
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Sorry.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.240
Student: It is actually
three minutes?

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.843
Professor Charles
Bailyn: So,

00:18:52.843 --> 00:18:55.134
if you start from time zero,
when everything is put

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:56.944
together,
after three minutes the

00:18:56.944 --> 00:19:00.271
Universe has cooled sufficiently
so that you can't have hydrogen

00:19:00.271 --> 00:19:03.650
fusion, generally.
Then, no more nuclear reactions

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:07.240
occur until much,
much later, when stars formed.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.991
And, we know how fast the
Universe is expanding because we

00:19:11.991 --> 00:19:15.160
can measure the Hubble Constant
now.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.923
And so, you know how long it
takes for the Universe to expand

00:19:18.923 --> 00:19:22.311
to the point where the
temperature drops enough so that

00:19:22.311 --> 00:19:25.259
there's no general hydrogen
fusion anymore.

00:19:25.259 --> 00:19:29.039
And then, you do this little
calculation to how much fuses

00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:30.980
during that time.
Other questions?

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.524
Okay.
More recently,

00:19:36.524 --> 00:19:40.655
with the Hubble Space Telescope
and other big ground-based

00:19:40.655 --> 00:19:44.443
telescopes,
we've discovered that you can

00:19:44.443 --> 00:19:50.278
now see galaxies that are very
far away, that are as they were

00:19:50.278 --> 00:19:55.730
a substantial fraction of the
age of the Universe ago.

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:59.577
And, by now,
it's clear that galaxies evolve

00:19:59.577 --> 00:20:04.319
and that the statistical
demographics of galaxies--how

00:20:04.319 --> 00:20:07.354
many there are,
how massive they are,

00:20:07.354 --> 00:20:10.405
how big they are,
all those kinds of things--that

00:20:10.405 --> 00:20:13.838
those statistics change
dramatically over the course of

00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:17.906
the Universe--over the course of
the amount of lookback time that

00:20:17.906 --> 00:20:24.586
we can currently observe.
So, galaxies evolve very

00:20:24.586 --> 00:20:30.473
significantly.
So, everything points toward

00:20:30.473 --> 00:20:36.546
the Big Bang and away from the
"steady state," much to the

00:20:36.546 --> 00:20:41.660
surprise of a lot of the
scientists who felt,

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.662
possibly correctly,
given what was known in the

00:20:44.662 --> 00:20:48.121
1950s, that the "steady state"
was a much more elegant

00:20:48.121 --> 00:20:51.490
solution.
And so, let's see.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:21:00.289
The fable here is the demise of
the "steady state."

00:21:00.289 --> 00:21:03.346
And the moral,
well, there are various morals

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:06.819
to this, but let me be
provocative and say that,

00:21:06.819 --> 00:21:15.432
sometimes science is
anti-atheistic,

00:21:15.432 --> 00:21:20.600
not anti-religious.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.371
Because it could have come out
the other way,

00:21:27.371 --> 00:21:29.139
right?
It could have turned out that

00:21:29.139 --> 00:21:33.761
this "steady state" was right.
And then, you wouldn't have had

00:21:33.761 --> 00:21:40.163
this moment of creation and you
wouldn't--and Pope John Paul II

00:21:40.163 --> 00:21:46.049
wouldn't have been so
enthusiastic about astrophysics.

00:21:46.049 --> 00:21:48.951
In just the same way,
it might have turned out that

00:21:48.951 --> 00:21:52.549
human beings are fundamentally
different from all other species

00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:54.845
of animals.
And if that had been true,

00:21:54.845 --> 00:21:57.969
the geneticists would have
discovered that instead of what

00:21:57.969 --> 00:22:00.684
they did discover.
And so, there's a feeling,

00:22:00.684 --> 00:22:03.150
particularly in current
political debates,

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.760
that scientists are somehow
intrinsically anti-religious,

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.849
and I think that isn't true.
It isn't one way or another.

00:22:11.849 --> 00:22:14.089
It's just a way of finding
stuff out.

00:22:14.089 --> 00:22:16.813
And sometimes,
as in this particular case,

00:22:16.813 --> 00:22:20.268
you might find out that the
atheists, or whatever the

00:22:20.268 --> 00:22:22.660
atheists had proposed,
is wrong.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:26.414
And that's actually what
happened in this particular

00:22:26.414 --> 00:22:28.744
case.
So, the demise of the "steady

00:22:28.744 --> 00:22:32.687
state" is one of the big things
that happened in the latter half

00:22:32.687 --> 00:22:35.271
of the twentieth century.
And so, now,

00:22:35.271 --> 00:22:39.221
the scientific evidence is
very, very strongly in favor of

00:22:39.221 --> 00:22:41.901
the Big Bang.
I should define what I mean,

00:22:41.901 --> 00:22:44.145
I think, by the Big Bang
Theory, because,

00:22:44.145 --> 00:22:47.119
as I said, this is a phrase
coined by its enemies.

00:22:47.119 --> 00:22:50.061
And it's one of these phrases
like "black hole," which

00:22:50.061 --> 00:22:52.670
actually doesn't have a
technical definition,

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:57.167
and you get into trouble by
people using it in different

00:22:57.167 --> 00:23:01.597
ways.
And so, if what you mean by

00:23:01.597 --> 00:23:05.170
this is that,
in the past,

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:10.599
the Universe was denser and
hotter,

00:23:10.599 --> 00:23:17.005
and smoother--because it's
constantly forming new stars and

00:23:17.005 --> 00:23:20.697
galaxies.
Everything is getting more

00:23:20.697 --> 00:23:25.938
lumpy with time--and that you
can extrapolate this to an

00:23:25.938 --> 00:23:33.085
initial singularity,
then, I think there's extremely

00:23:33.085 --> 00:23:40.279
strong scientific evidence in
favor of this.

00:23:40.279 --> 00:23:46.094
But you have to keep your eye
on this word "extrapolate,"

00:23:46.094 --> 00:23:52.428
because sometimes the Big Bang
is used to describe this moment

00:23:52.428 --> 00:23:56.170
of initial creation,
or whatever you want to call it.

00:23:56.170 --> 00:24:01.764
This initial moment of infinite
density, and somehow everything

00:24:01.764 --> 00:24:06.319
starting to expand.
You can't observe that.

00:24:06.319 --> 00:24:09.942
That's one of these things that
you can't see now,

00:24:09.942 --> 00:24:14.230
or with our current theories at
any point in the future.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.470
And so, that's an extrapolation.
That's not an observation.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:20.220
And that's a fundamentally
different thing.

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:24.112
So, if you use Big Bang to
indicate that particular moment,

00:24:24.112 --> 00:24:27.669
then you can say that the
scientific evidence for that

00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:31.637
actual moment isn't strong,
and indeed, couldn't even exist

00:24:31.637 --> 00:24:35.106
within our current theories,
because all of physics breaks

00:24:35.106 --> 00:24:37.999
down, there.
And so, what I mean when I say

00:24:37.999 --> 00:24:42.089
that there's a lot of scientific
support for the Big Bang is,

00:24:42.089 --> 00:24:45.001
there is support for this idea
that the Universe is changing in

00:24:45.001 --> 00:24:46.177
time.
It was denser,

00:24:46.177 --> 00:24:49.083
hotter, and smoother in the
past, and that if you

00:24:49.083 --> 00:24:51.626
extrapolate this back,
there was an initial

00:24:51.626 --> 00:24:54.170
singularity some number of years
ago.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:57.353
And you can actually figure out
how many years ago that was,

00:24:57.353 --> 00:24:59.349
which is what I'm about to do
next.

00:24:59.349 --> 00:25:04.279
And so, this is now the kind of
currently accepted theory.

00:25:04.279 --> 00:25:07.117
I should say,
there are a few remnant

00:25:07.117 --> 00:25:12.004
holdouts from the "steady state"
type, who annoy the rest of us

00:25:12.004 --> 00:25:15.700
by not giving in.
And there's actually been some

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.829
interesting controversy over the
years about,

00:25:18.829 --> 00:25:22.916
you know, how much telescope
time do you give to people whose

00:25:22.916 --> 00:25:26.866
proposal is to look for the
places where mass is created in

00:25:26.866 --> 00:25:30.780
the "steady state" theory,
if nobody else believes that

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.976
theory anymore.
And, by now,

00:25:32.976 --> 00:25:37.388
the answer is none,
but it took quite a while to

00:25:37.388 --> 00:25:42.690
get to that point.
Okay.

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:45.499
Student: Do people ever
lie about what they're going to

00:25:45.499 --> 00:25:46.523
observe?
Professor Charles

00:25:46.523 --> 00:25:48.299
Bailyn: Do people lie about
what they're going to observe?

00:25:48.299 --> 00:25:51.980
Excellent--the graduate
students are amused.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.130
No.
What happens is this.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.315
You have to present--so,
you have to write these

00:25:56.315 --> 00:25:58.920
proposals, because the
telescopes are over-subscribed.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.922
And you have to come up with a
plausible thing that you're

00:26:01.922 --> 00:26:06.422
going to do.
Now, it then varies how this is

00:26:06.422 --> 00:26:10.804
actually done in operation.
In the space telescope,

00:26:10.804 --> 00:26:12.303
for example,
what you have to do is,

00:26:12.303 --> 00:26:14.529
then, you fill out what's
called a Phase II form,

00:26:14.529 --> 00:26:17.255
which tells exactly where the
space telescope is supposed to

00:26:17.255 --> 00:26:19.417
point and for how long.
And you submit that,

00:26:19.417 --> 00:26:21.180
and they upload it and they do
it.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.945
If you deviated drastically
from the target list you gave

00:26:24.945 --> 00:26:28.778
them when they approved your
proposal, that'll get flagged

00:26:28.778 --> 00:26:31.293
and they won't do it.
On the other hand,

00:26:31.293 --> 00:26:33.516
on ground-based telescopes,
you kind of go to the

00:26:33.516 --> 00:26:35.137
telescope, and still,
in many cases,

00:26:35.137 --> 00:26:37.518
you operate it yourself.
And there's not a lot of

00:26:37.518 --> 00:26:39.250
control over where you point the
thing.

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:43.771
The control then happens later.
One of the key components of a

00:26:43.771 --> 00:26:48.056
proposal for telescope time is
what you did with the data you

00:26:48.056 --> 00:26:52.339
got from the last amount of
telescope time they gave you.

00:26:52.339 --> 00:26:53.921
And, you know,
you have to list all the

00:26:53.921 --> 00:26:55.544
publications,
or if you haven't actually

00:26:55.544 --> 00:26:59.675
gotten to publishing anything,
which is usually the case with

00:26:59.675 --> 00:27:04.019
me recently, you have to show
little graphs or,

00:27:04.019 --> 00:27:06.862
you know, describe the data and
what you're going to do with it

00:27:06.862 --> 00:27:09.111
and so forth.
And one of the things--I sit on

00:27:09.111 --> 00:27:11.779
these committees that make these
kinds of decisions.

00:27:11.779 --> 00:27:15.919
And one of the things you look
for is if they haven't done

00:27:15.919 --> 00:27:19.411
interesting work and,
kind of, done what they claimed

00:27:19.411 --> 00:27:22.820
they would do the last time
round, their proposal goes down

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.309
to the bottom.
You're always looking for ways

00:27:25.309 --> 00:27:27.890
to trash other people's
proposals, because you've got

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:30.670
seven times more--in the case of
the space telescope,

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:33.729
you've got seven times more
proposals than you can grant,

00:27:33.729 --> 00:27:36.569
of which only a small handful
are not worth doing.

00:27:36.569 --> 00:27:39.550
And so, any opportunity you
have to say, you know,

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:42.286
these guys are bozos--you
definitely take that

00:27:42.286 --> 00:27:44.773
opportunity,
because otherwise you have way

00:27:44.773 --> 00:27:46.539
too many good proposals left
over.

00:27:46.539 --> 00:27:51.369
So, there's a kind of internal
control that isn't explicit on

00:27:51.369 --> 00:27:53.917
this sort of thing.
And after a while,

00:27:53.917 --> 00:27:56.680
you know, if people keep
getting up in public and saying,

00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:00.360
you know, quasars are sources
of mass energy creation and

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.304
therefore support the "steady
state"--even if they're a great

00:28:04.304 --> 00:28:07.473
big quasar expert,
you start to get a little bit

00:28:07.473 --> 00:28:11.038
queasy about giving them large
amounts of telescope time that

00:28:11.038 --> 00:28:13.950
might be more profitably used by
someone else.

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:17.981
This, then, gets interpreted by
the remnant "steady state"

00:28:17.981 --> 00:28:21.660
supporters, or whoever the
minority idea might be,

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.392
of a hugely oppressive
scientific bureaucracy,

00:28:24.392 --> 00:28:26.700
you know, not allowing the
maverick,

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.799
wonderful thinker to do their
own thing.

00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:34.799
And that, sometimes,
is true, but not often.

00:28:34.799 --> 00:28:37.699
Most of the time,
it's the sane people not

00:28:37.699 --> 00:28:41.094
allowing the insane people to
use the telescopes,

00:28:41.094 --> 00:28:44.559
and that's actually a much more
common thing.

00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:47.826
And so, while it can be good
propaganda to say,

00:28:47.826 --> 00:28:50.240
yeah, these oppressive,
elitist,

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:56.575
bureaucratic people--mafia who
run the scientific world are not

00:28:56.575 --> 00:29:02.195
allowing my great idea to get
any opportunities to prove

00:29:02.195 --> 00:29:04.386
itself.
Most of the time,

00:29:04.386 --> 00:29:07.019
it turns out,
the establishment is right.

00:29:07.019 --> 00:29:10.573
And so, there is this
interesting question about

00:29:10.573 --> 00:29:13.869
allocation of resources.
It's not just telescope time,

00:29:13.869 --> 00:29:15.289
more importantly,
even, money.

00:29:15.289 --> 00:29:17.490
There's a big debate right now,
for example,

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:20.509
in the theoretical physics
community about string theory.

00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:23.039
String theory is the hot theory
of everything.

00:29:23.039 --> 00:29:26.238
And everybody is supposed to be
a string theorist,

00:29:26.238 --> 00:29:28.849
in theoretical physics,
at the moment,

00:29:28.849 --> 00:29:31.441
except for a few people who
point out that it hasn't

00:29:31.441 --> 00:29:33.779
actually been all that
successful in explaining

00:29:33.779 --> 00:29:35.973
anything.
In fact, it hasn't explained

00:29:35.973 --> 00:29:37.909
anything, ever.
And therefore,

00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:41.920
might one not want to consider
alternative theories?

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.602
And then, the string theorists
say, but, you know,

00:29:44.602 --> 00:29:47.567
this is a really good idea.
We've got to continue to look

00:29:47.567 --> 00:29:49.089
at it.
One day we'll get it right and

00:29:49.089 --> 00:29:51.867
we'll figure out everything.
And so, there has now,

00:29:51.867 --> 00:29:55.936
recently, been some popular
books that claim that string

00:29:55.936 --> 00:29:59.856
theorists are oppressing
everybody else by not letting

00:29:59.856 --> 00:30:02.890
other kinds of good ideas be
funded,

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:07.496
and by not letting smart young
people who are working on other

00:30:07.496 --> 00:30:10.970
things--by not hiring them into
departments,

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:14.354
and so forth.
It's an interesting argument,

00:30:14.354 --> 00:30:18.099
and ongoing,
in the string theory community.

00:30:18.099 --> 00:30:19.937
It's, sort of--as I
said--they've been writing

00:30:19.937 --> 00:30:21.490
popular books on both sides of
this,

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:24.042
so, it's kind of busted out
into--you're going to read about

00:30:24.042 --> 00:30:25.990
this, now, in the New York
Review of Books,

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:29.961
and places like that.
And so, what you do about

00:30:29.961 --> 00:30:35.741
minority ideas--ideas that are
not supported by the current

00:30:35.741 --> 00:30:42.019
paradigm of a given scientific
subject is a very tricky one,

00:30:42.019 --> 00:30:44.834
and a very interesting one,
and one that needs to be

00:30:44.834 --> 00:30:47.548
reevaluated from time to time.
And, in fact,

00:30:47.548 --> 00:30:50.614
cosmology may be approaching
such a moment,

00:30:50.614 --> 00:30:55.140
where a genuinely new idea is
going to have to be required.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.912
We're probably not quite there
yet, but we'll talk about

00:30:58.912 --> 00:31:02.615
alternative cosmological
theories toward the end of the

00:31:02.615 --> 00:31:05.548
course.
Sorry, I didn't mean to go off

00:31:05.548 --> 00:31:09.032
on this, but it's on my mind,
because, as I said,

00:31:09.032 --> 00:31:12.953
I serve on these committees,
so you have to think about

00:31:12.953 --> 00:31:15.424
these things.
Actually, the space telescope

00:31:15.424 --> 00:31:16.910
people did a very interesting
thing.

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:20.303
At one point they decided--I
don't think they ever actually

00:31:20.303 --> 00:31:22.410
followed through on this--that
5%,

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:26.091
or some small amount of the
time--different scientific

00:31:26.091 --> 00:31:28.799
resources sometimes have
this–that,

00:31:28.799 --> 00:31:31.960
like, 5% of the time goes for
risky science.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.776
Science that's really weird,
and probably won't work--but if

00:31:35.776 --> 00:31:39.205
it works, it's incredibly
important because committees

00:31:39.205 --> 00:31:43.142
tend to not to want to do that.
They tend to want to do the

00:31:43.142 --> 00:31:46.920
things that they know are going
to produce some good result.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.206
And so, sometimes,
the people who organize these

00:31:50.206 --> 00:31:54.052
things force the committees to
have a little category of

00:31:54.052 --> 00:31:57.245
special, weird projects.
And then, of course,

00:31:57.245 --> 00:31:58.867
what happens?
Five years later,

00:31:58.867 --> 00:32:00.650
they analyze,
you know, where did all the

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:03.575
good science come from?
And if it didn't come from the

00:32:03.575 --> 00:32:06.163
weird projects,
which is almost certainly the

00:32:06.163 --> 00:32:08.869
case--although not 100%
certainly the case,

00:32:08.869 --> 00:32:11.463
but generally the case--then
they say, look we've wasted 5%

00:32:11.463 --> 00:32:12.850
of our money,
telescope time,

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:14.759
whatever it is.
We're going to close down this

00:32:14.759 --> 00:32:16.848
program.
And then, you kind of have to

00:32:16.848 --> 00:32:19.210
start over again.
So, how weird is weird?

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:25.870
Difficult to say.
All right.

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:28.542
The expansion of the Universe.
We now believe,

00:32:28.542 --> 00:32:33.741
for the reasons I outlined,
that this indicates a kind of

00:32:33.741 --> 00:32:37.392
Big Bang idea,
which means we can extrapolate

00:32:37.392 --> 00:32:41.468
back to the moment that it all
started, and we can calculate

00:32:41.468 --> 00:32:44.663
how long it took.
Let me do a simpler

00:32:44.663 --> 00:32:48.100
calculation, but exactly
analogous.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:52.958
Supposing you're in a car.
You're in a car and you're

00:32:52.958 --> 00:32:57.420
driving at a speed of 50 miles
per hour.

00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:06.300
And you are 100 miles away from
your starting point.

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.200
How long have you been driving?

00:33:17.849 --> 00:33:20.630
So, this, they taught you how
to solve in seventh grade.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:25.802
If you are 100 miles away,
you take time is equal to

00:33:25.802 --> 00:33:30.570
distance over velocity
[t=D/V].

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:34.799
So 100 miles.
You're going 50 miles an hour.

00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:40.100
That means you must have been
going for two hours.

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:45.312
Not such a hard problem.
There's a hidden assumption

00:33:45.312 --> 00:33:47.684
though--sorry?
Student: Speed is

00:33:47.684 --> 00:33:49.254
constant?
Professor Charles

00:33:49.254 --> 00:33:52.838
Bailyn: Speed is constant,
yeah--provided that the speed

00:33:52.838 --> 00:33:53.750
is constant.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:00.410
Okay.
But let's make that assumption.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:03.854
Let's assume that the Universe
is expanding at the same rate

00:34:03.854 --> 00:34:07.680
all the time.
How long has it been going?

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.710
Well, take some galaxy,
any galaxy.

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:12.239
It turns out,
it doesn't matter which galaxy.

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:20.616
And say--so,
galaxy A is at distance

00:34:20.616 --> 00:34:25.951
D.
It's moving at velocity

00:34:25.951 --> 00:34:31.420
V, away from us.
You know, that's the whole idea.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:35.510
So, how long has it been since
it was right on top of us?

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:43.280
Well, so, it's been going for a
time equal to D/V.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.327
By exact analogy with the
distance, velocity,

00:34:46.327 --> 00:34:49.720
time, questions that they ask
you about--you know,

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.559
cars driving to Cleveland,
and stuff.

00:34:52.559 --> 00:34:56.480
So, it's been going for time,
T= D/V.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.855
But now, in the case of
galaxies, there's this

00:34:59.855 --> 00:35:03.980
interesting relationship--that
V = H/D.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:12.230
So, D/V = 1/H.
Okay?

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:14.100
And that can be measured.
That's Hubble's Constant.

00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:23.904
And so, the age of the Universe
is equal to 1 over the Hubble

00:35:23.904 --> 00:35:29.366
Constant, provided that the
expansion has been at a constant

00:35:29.366 --> 00:35:30.200
rate.

00:35:33.719 --> 00:35:37.449
Let me remind you,
H has been measured.

00:35:37.449 --> 00:35:40.710
It's 70 kilometers per second
per megaparsec.

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:42.739
That's kind of an interesting
unit.

00:35:42.739 --> 00:35:45.699
You've got kilometers per
megaparsec.

00:35:45.699 --> 00:35:48.329
Both of those are measures of
distance.

00:35:48.329 --> 00:35:54.114
This is basically velocity over
distance, but velocity contains

00:35:54.114 --> 00:35:58.312
a distance within it.
So, if you were to cancel those

00:35:58.312 --> 00:36:02.219
two distance terms in some way,
you'd have that the units of

00:36:02.219 --> 00:36:05.000
the Hubble Constant are 1 over
seconds.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.680
So, the units of 1 over the
Hubble Constant are seconds.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:12.630
It's a measure of time.
It's reciprocal time.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:15.560
1/H is a measure of time.
What is that time?

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.793
It's the age of the Universe.
What do I mean by the age of

00:36:17.793 --> 00:36:19.805
the Universe?
That's how long it has been

00:36:19.805 --> 00:36:22.557
since all galaxies and all
objects in the Universe,

00:36:22.557 --> 00:36:25.364
all points in the Universe,
were piled on top of one

00:36:25.364 --> 00:36:28.309
another.
Yes?

00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:34.187
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:36:34.187 --> 00:36:39.940
Bailyn: Let's see,
did I write it wrong?

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:42.380
V equals – yeah.
I wrote it wrong.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:46.130
V = HD.
Thank you.

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:47.159
And so, now,
what am I going to do?

00:36:47.159 --> 00:36:49.019
I'm going to divide both sides
by H.

00:36:49.019 --> 00:36:51.428
I'm going to divide both sides
by V, and then it comes

00:36:51.428 --> 00:36:53.550
out right.
Sorry, thank you very much.

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:59.598
Stop me when I do that.
Right, because this is the

00:36:59.598 --> 00:37:00.060
Hubble Law.

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:09.159
Okay.
So, how old is the Universe?

00:37:09.159 --> 00:37:13.429
Well it's 1/70 kilometers per
second per megaparsec.

00:37:13.429 --> 00:37:16.860
That actually is not a very
useful unit of time.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.409
So, let's see if we can do
better.

00:37:19.409 --> 00:37:23.958
H is equal to 70
kilometers per second per

00:37:23.958 --> 00:37:26.573
megaparsec.
Now, we want to cancel the

00:37:26.573 --> 00:37:31.034
kilometers per megaparsec.
So, what we want to multiply

00:37:31.034 --> 00:37:36.760
this by is the number of
megaparsecs in 1 kilometer.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.570
That's a very small number,
right?

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:41.610
It's some tiny fraction,
because a megaparsec is huge.

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:43.672
It's, you know,
three million light-years,

00:37:43.672 --> 00:37:45.635
or something like that,
and a kilometer,

00:37:45.635 --> 00:37:48.989
not so huge.
So, let's calculate this term.

00:37:48.989 --> 00:37:54.320
That's going to be--1 kilometer
is 10^(3) meters.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:59.622
One megaparsec--a mega is
10^(6), so parsec is 3 x 10^(16)

00:37:59.622 --> 00:38:07.323
meters.
And so, this is equal to 1/3

00:38:07.323 --> 00:38:18.353
times--10^(-22)--10^(-19) equals
3 x 10^(-20),

00:38:18.353 --> 00:38:21.739
right?
But it's 70 of those.

00:38:21.739 --> 00:38:27.752
So, H is equal to 7 x
10^(1) x 3 x10^(-20),

00:38:27.752 --> 00:38:34.010
which is equal to 20 x
10^(-19), or 2 x 10^(-18).

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:38.432
In units of 1 over seconds.
So, 1/H,

00:38:38.432 --> 00:38:43.367
we know now,
in seconds, is equal to 1 / (2

00:38:43.367 --> 00:38:52.052
x 10^(-18) seconds).
That's (1/2) x 10^(18) or 5 x

00:38:52.052 --> 00:39:01.341
10^(17) seconds.
One year is equal to 3 x 10^(7)

00:39:01.341 --> 00:39:08.289
seconds.
So, the age of the Universe in

00:39:08.289 --> 00:39:15.139
years is (5 x 10^(17)) / (3 x
10^(7)),

00:39:15.139 --> 00:39:27.210
which is something like 1.7 x
10^(10), or 17 billion years.

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:34.915
So, that's the answer.
The Universe is 17 billion

00:39:34.915 --> 00:39:36.773
years old.
It's not quite the answer

00:39:36.773 --> 00:39:38.500
because of that assumption,
right?

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:42.262
The assumption was that the
Universe is expanding at the

00:39:42.262 --> 00:39:45.614
same rate all the time,
and that's not necessarily

00:39:45.614 --> 00:39:48.304
true.
And the next thing we're going

00:39:48.304 --> 00:39:52.176
to do is ask the question,
"What happens if the expansion

00:39:52.176 --> 00:39:55.150
rate of the Universe changes
with time?"

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:58.248
It probably does.
It almost certainly does,

00:39:58.248 --> 00:40:01.170
because the Universe is filled
with mass.

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:03.552
What does mass do?
Mass exerts--well,

00:40:03.552 --> 00:40:06.840
Newton would have it that mass
exerts gravitational force.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.600
It slows down the expansion of
the Universe.

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.192
So, what do you expect?
You expect the Universe to be

00:40:12.192 --> 00:40:15.826
slowing down gradually.
And this gives rise to a couple

00:40:15.826 --> 00:40:18.972
of possibilities,
and I think I mentioned this

00:40:18.972 --> 00:40:22.471
briefly in passing.
Now, we're going to do a

00:40:22.471 --> 00:40:27.400
more--in more detail.
This is the scale factor of the

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:33.190
Universe, which started at 0.
Here's time.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:36.890
Here's now.
Here's whatever the scale

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:41.579
factor of the Universe is now,
and what has happened.

00:40:41.579 --> 00:40:45.370
Here's what it looks like if
there's no change.

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:54.658
So, this is constant expansion.
And so, it is this amount of

00:40:54.658 --> 00:41:00.360
time that turns out to be 17
billion years.

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.353
But in fact,
it seems likely that the

00:41:03.353 --> 00:41:06.430
Universe is, in fact,
slowing down.

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:09.992
So, what does that look like?
Well, that means that in the

00:41:09.992 --> 00:41:14.316
future it's going to do this.
That means that in the past,

00:41:14.316 --> 00:41:17.596
it was doing this,
because it's presumably been

00:41:17.596 --> 00:41:20.519
slowing down since the very
beginning.

00:41:20.519 --> 00:41:24.277
And that means that the
Universe started later than you

00:41:24.277 --> 00:41:28.104
think, because it started
expanding more quickly than it

00:41:28.104 --> 00:41:29.920
is now,
and then it's been slowing down.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.873
So, in fact,
you might say that what we've

00:41:32.873 --> 00:41:36.835
really shown is that the
Universe has to be less than 17

00:41:36.835 --> 00:41:38.420
billion years old.

00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:46.663
By the way, this calculation is
why it was such bad news when

00:41:46.663 --> 00:41:49.767
Hubble got the answer wrong.
You will recall from the

00:41:49.767 --> 00:41:53.326
problem set, Hubble thought that
the Hubble Constant was 500

00:41:53.326 --> 00:41:55.740
kilometers per second per
megaparsec.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:42:01.300
500 is a bigger number.
It means--it's what?

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.570
Seven times bigger than we
currently believe.

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:07.108
That means that Hubble's
estimate of the age of the

00:42:07.108 --> 00:42:11.071
Universe was a factor of 7
smaller than 17 billion years,

00:42:11.071 --> 00:42:13.690
which is about 2.5 billion
years.

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:17.887
So, the implication of Hubble's
result in the Big Bang context,

00:42:17.887 --> 00:42:21.949
at least, was that the Universe
was 2.5 billion years old.

00:42:21.949 --> 00:42:24.705
That was very bad news,
because the geologists had

00:42:24.705 --> 00:42:27.909
already figured that the Earth
was 4 billion years old.

00:42:27.909 --> 00:42:31.787
And it's not good news to have
a planet that's a factor of two

00:42:31.787 --> 00:42:35.288
older than the Universe.
And so, this was part of the

00:42:35.288 --> 00:42:38.389
initial suspicion of the Big
Bang explanation.

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:42.619
Part of the reason people tried
to develop "steady state" ideas

00:42:42.619 --> 00:42:46.918
was that Hubble's calculation of
the constant gave you an age of

00:42:46.918 --> 00:42:50.261
the Universe that was in
contradiction to existing

00:42:50.261 --> 00:42:52.989
geological ages measured on
Earth.

00:42:52.989 --> 00:42:57.735
By now, we're up to 17 billion
years and that seems to--that's

00:42:57.735 --> 00:43:00.187
fine.
The Earth is only 4.5 billion

00:43:00.187 --> 00:43:03.409
years old, so there's no
conflict there anymore.

00:43:03.409 --> 00:43:06.963
There are some star clusters
that are known to be 12 or 13

00:43:06.963 --> 00:43:10.292
billion years old,
and they caused some trouble

00:43:10.292 --> 00:43:14.830
for some values of the Hubble
Constant until quite recently.

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:21.559
Okay.
But then, this begs a question;

00:43:21.559 --> 00:43:24.090
namely, "What's going to happen
in the future?"

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:28.376
Could it be that the expansion
of the Universe stops,

00:43:28.376 --> 00:43:30.684
turns around,
and comes back,

00:43:30.684 --> 00:43:35.300
leading to a "big crunch,"
another one of these technical

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:39.356
terms?
And how much mass would the

00:43:39.356 --> 00:43:44.579
Universe have to contain for
that to be true?

00:43:44.579 --> 00:43:46.800
So, let me do that calculation
now.

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.059
This is something we know how
to do.

00:43:49.059 --> 00:43:51.829
This is an escape velocity
problem.

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:55.980
You know, you throw a pen up in
the air.

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.309
If you throw it slowly,
it stops, turns around,

00:43:58.309 --> 00:44:00.081
and comes back.
If you throw it fast,

00:44:00.081 --> 00:44:02.523
it goes away.
Or, to put it a different way,

00:44:02.523 --> 00:44:05.639
if you throw a pen up in the
air at some velocity,

00:44:05.639 --> 00:44:09.028
whether it comes back or not
depends on the gravitational

00:44:09.028 --> 00:44:11.510
force of the planet you're
standing on,

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:13.873
which, in turn,
depends on the mass and the

00:44:13.873 --> 00:44:17.175
density of that planet.
So, if you set your Universe

00:44:17.175 --> 00:44:19.679
into motion, it's expanding
outward.

00:44:19.679 --> 00:44:23.191
Depending on the density of the
Universe, it can stop,

00:44:23.191 --> 00:44:24.913
turn around,
and fall back,

00:44:24.913 --> 00:44:29.690
or it can keep going.
So here's the calculation.

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:33.120
Here's us, or any other
observer.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:37.189
It works no matter what you do.
Then there's some galaxy,

00:44:37.189 --> 00:44:41.150
some distance,
D, away from us.

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:45.688
It's moving outwards at a rate
of some velocity,

00:44:45.688 --> 00:44:50.903
V, where V is
related to D by this

00:44:50.903 --> 00:44:54.420
equation--second per megaparsec,
that's right.

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.699
And then, what's trying to pull
it back?

00:44:57.699 --> 00:45:02.037
Well, the mass inside of this
region is trying to hold it

00:45:02.037 --> 00:45:04.253
back.
It's only the mass inside of

00:45:04.253 --> 00:45:07.778
that region because the mass
outside of the--we talked about

00:45:07.778 --> 00:45:13.860
this in the context of planets.
This all cancels out.

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:17.960
And so, what is the escape
velocity?

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:21.986
So, the escape velocity,
you may recall,

00:45:21.986 --> 00:45:28.739
is the square root of what?
2 GM/D.

00:45:28.739 --> 00:45:32.639
That's the escape velocity of
this object.

00:45:32.639 --> 00:45:35.900
Let me make sure I haven't
screwed this up.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.914
No, that's right.
And so, the question is,

00:45:38.914 --> 00:45:42.930
"Is V greater than
V_escape?"

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:50.100
All right.
So, let's evaluate this.

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:55.580
What's M?
M is equal to the

00:45:55.580 --> 00:46:02.738
density times the volume.
Density--we'll call that--give

00:46:02.738 --> 00:46:07.566
it its usual symbol of ρ.
And the volume is 4/3 π

00:46:07.566 --> 00:46:11.873
D^(3).
That's the volume of this

00:46:11.873 --> 00:46:17.241
sphere of material.
And you'll see why I translated

00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:21.883
into density in a minute.
The velocity is equal to

00:46:21.883 --> 00:46:26.573
H times D.
So, the question is:

00:46:26.573 --> 00:46:34.079
is H times D
greater than the square root of

00:46:34.079 --> 00:46:41.190
2 G/D times the mass,
ρ 4/3 πD^(3)?

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:42.949
All right, let's square both
sides.

00:46:42.949 --> 00:46:48.320
I've got to get rid of this
square root sign.

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:53.702
So H^(2)D^(2).
Is H^(2)D^(2)

00:46:53.702 --> 00:46:57.659
greater than 2 G ρ 4/3
π?

00:46:57.659 --> 00:47:00.836
And we've got D^(3) /
D, so that's

00:47:00.836 --> 00:47:01.850
D^(2).

00:47:07.789 --> 00:47:12.060
And here's the key thing:
the Ds cancel.

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:15.445
The distance cancels.
It doesn't matter which galaxy

00:47:15.445 --> 00:47:18.547
you pick.
It doesn't matter how far away

00:47:18.547 --> 00:47:22.004
that galaxy is.
You get the exact same result

00:47:22.004 --> 00:47:25.559
for every portion of the
Universe you examine.

00:47:25.559 --> 00:47:36.800
So, the question becomes,
"Is the density less than

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:45.880
3H^(2) / 8 π G?"
I've just rearranged the terms.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:48.900
This is the ρ.
It's still on the less-than

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.590
side.
I've taken the-- 2 x 4 = 8,

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:53.583
that's this 8.
There's a π,

00:47:53.583 --> 00:47:57.124
that goes down here.
This 3 comes over on top,

00:47:57.124 --> 00:48:01.099
and the H^(2) stays
where it is.

00:48:01.099 --> 00:48:06.699
So, this quantity is defined as
the critical density.

00:48:06.699 --> 00:48:10.248
If the density of the Universe
is less than the critical

00:48:10.248 --> 00:48:12.830
density, the Universe expands
forever.

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:21.440
If the density of the Universe
is greater than the critical

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.410
density, then the Universe
re-collapses.

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:34.428
So, we can calculate this.
This is all constants on this

00:48:34.428 --> 00:48:37.231
right-hand side.
We've measured H,

00:48:37.231 --> 00:48:41.860
so we know what that is.
3 x 2 x 10^(-18),

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:47.523
that's H.
We worked that out,

00:48:47.523 --> 00:48:52.270
squared, over 8 π 7 x
10^(-11).

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:57.150
And now, it's just arithmetic.
And I'll tell you the answer.

00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:58.780
You can work it out for
yourself.

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:02.992
I got 6 x 10^(-27),
and this is in units of

00:49:02.992 --> 00:49:08.440
kilograms per meter cubed.
That's a really small density.

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:11.920
It doesn't take much to hold
the Universe back.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.610
On the other hand,
the Universe is really big.

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:19.560
Obviously, the density of this
room, of the air in this room

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:23.420
is, you know,
30 orders of magnitude bigger.

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:26.491
That's why the Earth isn't
expanding, because we're so

00:49:26.491 --> 00:49:30.025
dense that our little region of
the Universe has turned around

00:49:30.025 --> 00:49:33.649
and re-collapsed long since.
But if you take the Universe,

00:49:33.649 --> 00:49:37.480
as a whole, planets are rare.
Stars are rare.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.742
Galaxies, even, are rare.
And it turns out,

00:49:40.742 --> 00:49:45.164
as we'll discuss next time,
that the Universe is actually

00:49:45.164 --> 00:49:48.599
fairly close in bulk.
If you take a large enough

00:49:48.599 --> 00:49:52.035
region that includes all the
empty space, it turns out that

00:49:52.035 --> 00:49:54.760
the average density of the
Universe is actually

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.899
surprisingly close to this
critical value at which the

00:49:57.899 --> 00:50:01.097
Universe will be balanced
between expanding forever and

00:50:01.097 --> 00:50:04.327
re-collapsing.
And so, we'll talk about how

00:50:04.327 --> 00:50:08.063
you actually measure the average
density of the Universe,

00:50:08.063 --> 00:50:10.999
and thus, determine the fate of
the Universe,

00:50:10.999 --> 00:50:11.999
next time.

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.878
Professor Steven Smith:
Last time, I believe I said I

00:00:05.878 --> 00:00:10.220
wanted to discuss three features
that Tocqueville regarded as

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.904
central to American democracy.
That is not to say they were

00:00:14.904 --> 00:00:19.431
central to the democratic
experience, but they are central

00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:23.562
features of the American
democratic experience and to

00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:28.169
what degree these can be or
could possibly be translated to

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:33.253
other contexts in other emerging
democracies remains very much an

00:00:33.253 --> 00:00:37.334
open question.
But of these three features,

00:00:37.334 --> 00:00:41.602
the first I talked a little bit
about on Monday is the

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:47.476
importance of local government,
the township as it's translated

00:00:47.476 --> 00:00:51.724
in this edition,
what Tocqueville calls the

00:00:51.724 --> 00:00:54.059
"commune,"
the community,

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.680
community spirit,
local government.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.372
In some way,
connected to what he calls

00:01:03.372 --> 00:01:06.620
later in the book "the spirit of
the city,"

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.342
using "the city" here in the
context of the ancient sense of

00:01:10.342 --> 00:01:12.930
polis,
l'esprit de citÃ©,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.463
a kind of polis-like character
in these small New England

00:01:17.463 --> 00:01:22.083
townships, very important,
Tocqueville believes,

00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:28.247
for the sustaining a democratic
country and a democratic

00:01:28.247 --> 00:01:30.786
society.
But the second,

00:01:30.786 --> 00:01:35.142
and probably the aspect of
Tocqueville's account of

00:01:35.142 --> 00:01:40.107
democratic America that has
received the most attention at

00:01:40.107 --> 00:01:44.620
least recently,
is the aspect of what he calls

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.160
throughout the book "civil
association," civic association.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.891
It is what one might think of
as intermediary groups,

00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:58.805
voluntary groups,
civic organizations of all

00:01:58.805 --> 00:02:03.628
kinds that Tocqueville is
immensely impressed with and

00:02:03.628 --> 00:02:08.360
which he turns into one of the
central pillars of the

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.221
democratic experience.
He writes that,

00:02:12.221 --> 00:02:16.597
"in democratic countries," one
of the most famous sentences

00:02:16.597 --> 00:02:19.802
from the book,
"In democratic countries,

00:02:19.802 --> 00:02:24.569
the science of association," he
says, "is the mother science.

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.293
The progress of all the others
depends on the progress of that

00:02:30.293 --> 00:02:33.006
one."
And it is through uniting and

00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:36.481
joining together in common
endeavors, he believes,

00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:41.020
that people develop a taste for
liberty, a taste for freedom.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.332
"In America," if I can just
quote him again,

00:02:43.332 --> 00:02:45.375
"In America,
I encountered all sorts of

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:47.697
associations,
of which, I confess,

00:02:47.697 --> 00:02:51.498
I had no idea and I often
admired the infinite art with

00:02:51.498 --> 00:02:55.580
which the inhabitants of the
United States managed to fix a

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.803
common goal to the efforts of
many men to get them to advance

00:02:59.803 --> 00:03:04.047
it freely."
Struck by the immense variety

00:03:04.047 --> 00:03:10.003
and multiplicity and sheer
number of these various kinds of

00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:14.383
civic association.
It is important to see,

00:03:14.383 --> 00:03:20.086
perhaps, this is one area in
which Tocqueville seems to most

00:03:20.086 --> 00:03:25.258
clearly depart from Rousseau,
at least the Rousseau of the

00:03:25.258 --> 00:03:29.563
Social Contract after
having said last time that his

00:03:29.563 --> 00:03:33.679
account of local democracy,
township democracy owes so much

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:36.300
to Rousseau's account of the
general will.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.674
But remember that Rousseau in
the Social Contract,

00:03:39.674 --> 00:03:43.104
would inveigh against,
warned against what he called

00:03:43.104 --> 00:03:47.004
"partial associations," partial
associations like interest

00:03:47.004 --> 00:03:51.178
groups of various kinds that had
the tendency to frustrate the

00:03:51.178 --> 00:03:54.212
general will,
that stand, as it were,

00:03:54.212 --> 00:03:57.740
between the individual and the
general will.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.663
But Tocqueville,
on the other hand,

00:03:59.663 --> 00:04:02.379
regards these kinds of
voluntary associations,

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.281
associations of all sorts as
precisely the place where we

00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:12.317
learn habits of initiative,
cooperation and responsibility

00:04:12.317 --> 00:04:15.361
with others.
By taking care of our own

00:04:15.361 --> 00:04:18.890
interests or the interests of
our association,

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.970
we learn to take care of the
interests of others.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.170
"Sentiments and ideas renew
themselves," Tocqueville writes.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.970
"The heart is enlarged and the
human mind is developed."

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.767
So you can see from a passage
like that how much weight he

00:04:35.767 --> 00:04:38.100
puts on these civic
associations.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.199
"The heart is enlarged.
The mind is developed."

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.675
It is through these
associations,

00:04:44.675 --> 00:04:47.847
PTAs, churches,
synagogues and other civil

00:04:47.847 --> 00:04:52.488
bodies and associations that
institutions are formed that can

00:04:52.488 --> 00:04:57.440
both resist in its way the power
of centralized authority,

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.694
central government.
But they are also,

00:05:00.694 --> 00:05:05.641
as it were, the locus,
the seedbed where citizens

00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:09.660
learn to become democratic
citizens.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.632
It is very much important for
Tocqueville that these

00:05:13.632 --> 00:05:16.826
associations,
the absence of which he felt

00:05:16.826 --> 00:05:21.529
very acutely in France,
which had already become a

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:26.834
highly centralized society.
It was these intermediary,

00:05:26.834 --> 00:05:32.517
voluntary associations that
stand between the individual and

00:05:32.517 --> 00:05:36.261
central authority,
the authority of the national

00:05:36.261 --> 00:05:39.170
government, which is what makes
them, of course,

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.727
so important for him.
This argument about the

00:05:42.727 --> 00:05:45.190
importance of civic
association--I say it has

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.331
become,
in a way, the most talked about

00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:53.243
passage or part of the book in
recent years--is due in large

00:05:53.243 --> 00:05:57.240
part to the influence of
political scientist,

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.481
Robert Putnam,
a man who teaches at another

00:06:01.481 --> 00:06:06.430
university, a book called
Bowling Alone.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.319
You've probably maybe heard of
that.

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:13.942
Here, Putnam speaks about what
he calls "human capital," what

00:06:13.942 --> 00:06:18.439
Tocqueville, in less social
scientific jargon,

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:23.026
calls "habits of the heart,"
mores, habits of the mind and

00:06:23.026 --> 00:06:25.539
heart.
But Putnam argues that it is

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:28.879
this social capital that is
developed through civic

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:31.350
association and his chief
example,

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.983
as the title of the book and
the article from which it draws

00:06:35.983 --> 00:06:40.382
suggest, is that the bowling
league is a kind of model of

00:06:40.382 --> 00:06:43.071
civic association.
Particularly,

00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:47.211
he is concerned with the
decline of these associations in

00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:51.093
contemporary American life.
Hence the title of the book,

00:06:51.093 --> 00:06:54.116
Bowling Alone.
The fact that Tocqueville

00:06:54.116 --> 00:06:58.166
himself describes these civic
associations as the product of

00:06:58.166 --> 00:07:00.431
art suggests that,
that is to say,

00:07:00.431 --> 00:07:05.883
that they are not natural.
They are not somehow the result

00:07:05.883 --> 00:07:10.600
of some kind of instinctual
behavior on us.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.620
Joining with others in
voluntary associations is a

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.497
learned activity.
It is something that requires a

00:07:18.497 --> 00:07:22.310
certain kind of culture and is a
learned activity.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.207
It is something also,
it is an art,

00:07:24.207 --> 00:07:26.607
it's a skill,
it is a craft that can also be

00:07:26.607 --> 00:07:29.314
lost.
His argument is that more and

00:07:29.314 --> 00:07:31.442
more people are,
so to speak,

00:07:31.442 --> 00:07:35.384
choosing to "bowl alone,"
something that shows an

00:07:35.384 --> 00:07:39.566
alarming tendency towards
isolation and the subsequent

00:07:39.566 --> 00:07:43.670
kind of depletion almost of our
civic capacities.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.907
The question is,
taking Tocqueville to the

00:07:46.907 --> 00:07:51.883
present, have our capacities for
joining with others been eroded

00:07:51.883 --> 00:07:55.990
by the forces of modern politics
and technology?

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.916
Are, in fact,
we becoming more and more a

00:07:58.916 --> 00:08:01.990
nation of solitaries and couch
potatoes?

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.011
These are some of the serious
questions and there is a big

00:08:10.011 --> 00:08:12.629
literature that has grown up
around it.

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:18.744
Some of this literature finds
Putnam's conclusions to be

00:08:18.744 --> 00:08:24.526
overdrawn, that he exaggerates
the influence of these

00:08:24.526 --> 00:08:30.529
associations or the decline of
these associations.

00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:35.940
In fact, our civic state is not
as bad off as he suggests.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.545
But what I want to do,
suggest today,

00:08:37.545 --> 00:08:40.221
and this is where we're going
to show a film and Jude's going

00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:42.576
to help me,
just a couple of clips,

00:08:42.576 --> 00:08:45.803
is that there is a serious
question, I think,

00:08:45.803 --> 00:08:49.170
in my mind,
whether bowling leagues are a

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.639
proper model for a democratic
association.

00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:55.594
Now, one can say,
and using the title "Bowling

00:08:55.594 --> 00:08:58.877
Alone" that Putnam is just
speaking metaphorically,

00:08:58.877 --> 00:09:01.570
that he doesn't mean bowling
leagues.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.549
He's just using it as a
metaphor.

00:09:03.549 --> 00:09:08.209
But let's take him at his word
and let's find out if bowling

00:09:08.209 --> 00:09:11.842
leagues are, in fact,
the ideal transmitter for

00:09:11.842 --> 00:09:16.325
democratic mores and values.
I want to take an example from

00:09:16.325 --> 00:09:20.040
a movie of which I'm very fond
by the Coen brothers called

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.427
The Big Lebowski,
which is a movie about a

00:09:23.427 --> 00:09:26.546
bowling league,
or at least three gentlemen who

00:09:26.546 --> 00:09:30.750
take their bowling and their
bowling league very seriously.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:35.294
The three of them are "The
Dude," who is a stoned hippie,

00:09:35.294 --> 00:09:39.514
"Walter," who's kind of a
whacked out Vietnam vet and

00:09:39.514 --> 00:09:42.935
"Donny," who's a lost waif.
They are very,

00:09:42.935 --> 00:09:45.715
very concerned with getting
into the finals,

00:09:45.715 --> 00:09:50.265
into the bowling tournament.
In their way stands a man named

00:09:50.265 --> 00:09:54.700
Jesus Quintana who happens also
to be a sex offender.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.341
I want to show a couple of
clips from this movie and I

00:09:58.341 --> 00:10:02.258
should warn you that there is
some very bad language being

00:10:02.258 --> 00:10:04.931
used here.
So if you think that is going

00:10:04.931 --> 00:10:07.409
to be offensive to you,
you should leave.

00:10:07.409 --> 00:10:11.080
It won't take more than about
four minutes or so.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.490
We're going to show a couple of
clips about the ethos of

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.260
men bowling.

00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:51.899
Professor Steven Smith:
One more.

00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:55.704
Professor Steven Smith:
Obviously, it goes to show that

00:10:55.704 --> 00:10:59.259
civic association alone is not
enough to create democratic

00:10:59.259 --> 00:11:01.264
citizens.
Again, otherwise,

00:11:01.264 --> 00:11:05.060
"Smokey" and "The Dude" and
"Walter" would be a perfect

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:10.076
example of democratic citizens.
Tocqueville focuses on a third,

00:11:10.076 --> 00:11:15.075
another leg of the stool of
democratic life and that is what

00:11:15.075 --> 00:11:18.210
he calls the "spirit of
religion."

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:23.201
Central, again,
as the third and maybe a very

00:11:23.201 --> 00:11:29.440
important prop of the American
democratic experience.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.092
"On my arrival in the United
States," he observes,

00:11:33.092 --> 00:11:37.639
"It was the religious aspect of
the country that struck my eye

00:11:37.639 --> 00:11:41.289
first."
Very impressed with that.

00:11:41.289 --> 00:11:44.778
Like other European visitors to
the United States,

00:11:44.778 --> 00:11:48.922
both then as well as now,
Tocqueville was deeply struck

00:11:48.922 --> 00:11:53.597
with how democracy and religion
seem to walk hand-in-hand with

00:11:53.597 --> 00:11:56.727
each other,
precisely the opposite of what

00:11:56.727 --> 00:12:00.361
has occurred in Europe where
religion and democracy or

00:12:00.361 --> 00:12:04.269
religion and equality were long
on a collision course.

00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:09.052
What made the American
encounter with democratic life

00:12:09.052 --> 00:12:12.113
unique?
That is one of Tocqueville's

00:12:12.113 --> 00:12:15.255
big questions.
In the first instance,

00:12:15.255 --> 00:12:18.969
you could say,
or as Tocqueville notes that

00:12:18.969 --> 00:12:22.860
America is primarily a puritan
democracy.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:27.362
"I see the whole destiny of
America contained in the first

00:12:27.362 --> 00:12:30.679
puritan who landed on its
shores," he says,

00:12:30.679 --> 00:12:34.549
"like the whole human race in
the first man."

00:12:34.549 --> 00:12:41.247
Our experience was determined
in crucial ways by early

00:12:41.247 --> 00:12:44.936
Puritanism.
America was created by people

00:12:44.936 --> 00:12:49.028
with strong religious beliefs
and habits who brought to the

00:12:49.028 --> 00:12:52.837
New World a suspicion of
government and a strong desire

00:12:52.837 --> 00:12:56.962
for independence.
This has been the foundation of

00:12:56.962 --> 00:13:01.942
the separation of church and
state that has done so much both

00:13:01.942 --> 00:13:05.179
for religious and political
liberty.

00:13:05.179 --> 00:13:09.854
Tocqueville drew from this two
very important consequences,

00:13:09.854 --> 00:13:13.320
I think, about religious life
in America.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.604
The first is that the thesis
propounded by the great

00:13:17.604 --> 00:13:21.803
philosophers of the
Enlightenment of the eighteenth

00:13:21.803 --> 00:13:25.080
century and still advanced in
many,

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.878
you might say,
enlightened quarters today,

00:13:28.878 --> 00:13:34.529
that religion will disappear
with the advance of modernity.

00:13:34.529 --> 00:13:38.759
As modernity advances,
religious life will disappear.

00:13:38.759 --> 00:13:42.654
I suppose in the twentieth
century, Max Weber gave voice

00:13:42.654 --> 00:13:46.973
most prominently to that point
of view that would be a process

00:13:46.973 --> 00:13:50.867
of secularization within
modernity and a sort of gradual

00:13:50.867 --> 00:13:53.769
withering away of religious
belief.

00:13:53.769 --> 00:13:57.737
Tocqueville shows that to be
demonstrably false,

00:13:57.737 --> 00:14:02.548
that religion will not simply
disappear as modernity moves

00:14:02.548 --> 00:14:06.009
forward and that the
Enlightenment and its

00:14:06.009 --> 00:14:10.127
contemporary heirs,
theorists of development and

00:14:10.127 --> 00:14:14.213
modernization and so on have
been all together wrong about

00:14:14.213 --> 00:14:18.371
their confident predictions
about the decline and withering

00:14:18.371 --> 00:14:22.971
away of religious faith.
Secondly, Tocqueville takes it

00:14:22.971 --> 00:14:27.847
to be a terrible mistake to try
to eliminate religion or to

00:14:27.847 --> 00:14:31.803
secularize society all together.
This is, in fact,

00:14:31.803 --> 00:14:35.320
probably a more controversial,
a very controversial claim.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.630
It was his belief,
and again, perhaps here he's

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:43.020
influenced by Rousseau in the
chapter on civil religion at the

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.762
end of the Social
Contract that free societies

00:14:46.762 --> 00:14:51.080
rest on public morality and that
morality cannot be effective

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.622
without religion.
It may be true that individuals

00:14:55.622 --> 00:14:59.425
can derive moral guidance from
reason alone,

00:14:59.425 --> 00:15:03.630
but societies can't.
The danger of attempting to

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:08.535
eliminate religion from public
life is that the need or desire

00:15:08.535 --> 00:15:13.038
to believe will therefore be
transferred to other and far

00:15:13.038 --> 00:15:17.098
more dangerous outlooks.
"Despotism," he says,

00:15:17.098 --> 00:15:20.720
"can do without faith,
but freedom cannot."

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.292
A very arresting sentence.
"Despotism can do without

00:15:25.292 --> 00:15:30.073
faith, but freedom cannot."
"Religion is more necessary in

00:15:30.073 --> 00:15:34.621
a republic and in a democratic
country than any other," he

00:15:34.621 --> 00:15:37.784
says.
But why is religion necessary

00:15:37.784 --> 00:15:40.953
to a republic?
Why does democracy require

00:15:40.953 --> 00:15:43.675
religion?
Here, Tocqueville gives a

00:15:43.675 --> 00:15:47.564
variety of answers.
One persistent theme running

00:15:47.564 --> 00:15:52.623
throughout his book as a whole
is that only religion can resist

00:15:52.623 --> 00:15:57.681
the tendency toward materialism
and a kind of low self-interest

00:15:57.681 --> 00:16:03.230
that he believes is intrinsic to
democratic ages and societies.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:08.669
"The principal business of
religion," he frequently writes,

00:16:08.669 --> 00:16:11.669
"is to purify,
is to regulate,

00:16:11.669 --> 00:16:16.650
is to restrain the kind of
ardent desire for well-being and

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.827
particularly,
material well-being that

00:16:19.827 --> 00:16:24.980
becomes particularly prominent
during ages of equality."

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.713
That's one reason.
But secondly or in addition,

00:16:28.713 --> 00:16:31.903
Tocqueville operates,
I find, with a very

00:16:31.903 --> 00:16:35.127
interesting,
I might even call it a

00:16:35.127 --> 00:16:40.934
metaphysic of faith that regards
religious belief as a necessary

00:16:40.934 --> 00:16:45.838
component for human action.
"When religion is destroyed in

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:50.163
a people," this is Tocqueville.
"When religion is destroyed in

00:16:50.163 --> 00:16:53.840
a people, doubt takes hold of
the higher portion of the

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.110
intellect and half paralyzes all
the others."

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:03.019
When religion is destroyed,
doubt takes over.

00:17:03.019 --> 00:17:07.648
It has a kind of a paralyzing
effect on the will and our

00:17:07.648 --> 00:17:11.846
capacity for action.
This paralysis of the will,

00:17:11.846 --> 00:17:16.538
this inability to act is a
condition that later writers

00:17:16.538 --> 00:17:22.333
would choose to call "nihilism."
Faith is a necessary component

00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:27.472
for our belief that we are free
agents and not simply the

00:17:27.472 --> 00:17:31.509
play-thing of blind forces and
random causes,

00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:35.388
so to speak.
Our beliefs about freedom and

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:39.945
the dignity of the individual
are inseparable for him from

00:17:39.945 --> 00:17:44.103
religious faith and it is
unlikely that these beliefs

00:17:44.103 --> 00:17:48.420
about the dignity of the
individual can survive without

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:52.019
religion.
Just to take a contemporary

00:17:52.019 --> 00:17:56.055
example of that,
think about the debates we have

00:17:56.055 --> 00:18:01.295
had over such things as cloning
and the sense that many people

00:18:01.295 --> 00:18:05.160
have that the dignity of the
individual,

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:11.178
which is often connected with a
kind of religious belief,

00:18:11.178 --> 00:18:15.717
sanctity of life,
the dignity of the individual

00:18:15.717 --> 00:18:20.367
is somehow deeply violated by
these advances of sort of

00:18:20.367 --> 00:18:26.955
scientific technology.
Religion remains a crucial prop

00:18:26.955 --> 00:18:32.250
for our beliefs about human
dignity.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.828
No more powerful challenge to
the Enlightenment's faith in

00:18:36.828 --> 00:18:40.924
science and scientific progress
can be found than in

00:18:40.924 --> 00:18:44.216
Tocqueville.
One final issues remains,

00:18:44.216 --> 00:18:46.931
I would say.
Tocqueville often writes,

00:18:46.931 --> 00:18:50.807
and I would say this is the
dominant tone of his writing on

00:18:50.807 --> 00:18:53.707
religion.
He often writes as if religion

00:18:53.707 --> 00:18:57.342
is only valuable or valuable
primarily for the social

00:18:57.342 --> 00:19:00.762
function it serves.
This is certainly consistent

00:19:00.762 --> 00:19:03.720
with lots of things he says
about religion.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.099
He's only concerned about
religion for its social and

00:19:07.099 --> 00:19:10.934
political consequences rather
than from the deeper truths of

00:19:10.934 --> 00:19:14.304
religious belief.
"I view religion," he says,

00:19:14.304 --> 00:19:18.089
"only from a purely human point
of view," he says.

00:19:18.089 --> 00:19:20.950
He's only looking for its
affect on society.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:24.406
But I would ask,
how accurate is that statement,

00:19:24.406 --> 00:19:27.421
or does it describe or
characterize all of

00:19:27.421 --> 00:19:30.290
Tocqueville's views about
religion?

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:34.316
I think not.
Let me just say why for a

00:19:34.316 --> 00:19:36.567
minute.
I think that sort of

00:19:36.567 --> 00:19:40.040
sociological or functionalist
reading of religion,

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:44.079
that he's interested in it only
for its social affect,

00:19:44.079 --> 00:19:48.211
is only part of Tocqueville's
very complex attitude towards

00:19:48.211 --> 00:19:50.711
this subject.
Maybe you'll have a chance to

00:19:50.711 --> 00:19:53.697
talk about this in your section.
Maybe you'll have an

00:19:53.697 --> 00:19:57.089
opportunity to write about it at
some other time.

00:19:57.089 --> 00:19:59.881
But remember that Tocqueville
was not only a student of

00:19:59.881 --> 00:20:02.197
Rousseau.
As he said in that letter to

00:20:02.197 --> 00:20:04.942
Louis de Kergolay that I
mentioned last time,

00:20:04.942 --> 00:20:08.811
his other two great sources of
inspiration were Montesquieu and

00:20:08.811 --> 00:20:12.930
a seventeenth-century French
philosopher named Blaise Pascal.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:18.042
Pascal was a religious
philosopher, who more than any

00:20:18.042 --> 00:20:24.039
other, emphasized the emptiness
of knowledge without faith.

00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:30.146
Man may be the rational animal,
but reason is somehow unable to

00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:36.055
plumb or reason is unable to
grasp the unfathomable depths of

00:20:36.055 --> 00:20:40.107
the universe.
In one of his most famous

00:20:40.107 --> 00:20:45.146
statements, Pascal said,
"A vapor," a drop of water is

00:20:45.146 --> 00:20:48.379
enough to kill him,
speaking of us,

00:20:48.379 --> 00:20:51.839
humans.
"A drop of water is enough to

00:20:51.839 --> 00:20:53.963
kill us.
Man is a reed,

00:20:53.963 --> 00:20:59.880
a reed, the weakest in nature,
but he is a thinking reed."

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:06.645
We are weak.
We think, but it is our

00:21:06.645 --> 00:21:09.544
weakness.
It is our dependence,

00:21:09.544 --> 00:21:12.619
sense of dependence that struck
Pascal.

00:21:12.619 --> 00:21:15.473
Tocqueville,
you can find this in several

00:21:15.473 --> 00:21:18.539
passages throughout the
Democracy.

00:21:18.539 --> 00:21:21.722
Tocqueville,
I think discovered in Pascal a

00:21:21.722 --> 00:21:24.829
sense of kind of existential
emptiness,

00:21:24.829 --> 00:21:30.039
an incompleteness of life that
cannot be explained in terms of

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:32.913
reason alone.
There is also,

00:21:32.913 --> 00:21:39.403
he felt, something deeply
hubristic about the way in which

00:21:39.403 --> 00:21:45.095
conditions of equality foster
this idea of rational

00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:49.092
self-sufficiency.
Tocqueville's purpose,

00:21:49.092 --> 00:21:51.806
in many ways,
was to limit reason to make

00:21:51.806 --> 00:21:54.860
room for faith,
and this is one of my favorite

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.121
passages.
Let me just read a sentence or

00:21:57.121 --> 00:21:59.744
two.
"The short space of 60 years,"

00:21:59.744 --> 00:22:04.219
he writes, almost as an aside.
"The short space of 60 years

00:22:04.219 --> 00:22:07.700
will never confine the whole
imagination of man.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:12.827
The incomplete joys of this
world will never suffice for his

00:22:12.827 --> 00:22:16.104
heart."
Incomplete joys of this world

00:22:16.104 --> 00:22:19.029
will never suffice for his
heart.

00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:21.975
In other words,
there is something we desire

00:22:21.975 --> 00:22:25.880
beyond the here and now that
only faith and can supply.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:30.534
The soul exhibits a kind of
longing, a desire for eternity

00:22:30.534 --> 00:22:35.596
and a kind of disgust with the
world and the limits of physical

00:22:35.596 --> 00:22:38.426
existence.
"Religion," he goes on,

00:22:38.426 --> 00:22:42.680
"is only a particular form of
hope and it as natural to the

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:46.998
human heart as hope itself.
Only by a kind of aberration of

00:22:46.998 --> 00:22:50.893
the intellect and with the aid
of a sort of moral violence

00:22:50.893 --> 00:22:55.539
exercised on their own nature do
men stray from religious belief.

00:22:55.539 --> 00:23:00.220
An invincible inclination leads
them back to religion.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:05.384
Disbelief is an accident.
Faith alone is the permanent

00:23:05.384 --> 00:23:09.062
state of humanity."
If anyone's interested,

00:23:09.062 --> 00:23:12.839
that's on page 284.
But no one can possibly read

00:23:12.839 --> 00:23:17.936
that section and come away from
Tocqueville by thinking he had

00:23:17.936 --> 00:23:22.815
only a kind of functionalist,
sociological view of religion,

00:23:22.815 --> 00:23:27.080
concerned with its effects on
human behavior and society.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:32.433
Disbelief is an accident.
Faith is the permanent

00:23:32.433 --> 00:23:38.102
condition of humanity and only
through a kind of moral

00:23:38.102 --> 00:23:43.878
violence, through moral violence
can religious faith be

00:23:43.878 --> 00:23:47.874
eliminated.
I think these passages show a

00:23:47.874 --> 00:23:52.443
much deeper, almost metaphysical
dimension to Tocqueville's

00:23:52.443 --> 00:23:55.200
thought.
It shows him to be,

00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:00.673
like Plato in many ways,
of enormous psychological depth

00:24:00.673 --> 00:24:05.010
and subtlety and insight.
But these are the three

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:08.515
features, or three of the
features, I think the three

00:24:08.515 --> 00:24:12.357
central features that remain for
him crucial to democracy:

00:24:12.357 --> 00:24:16.661
local government,
civil association and what he

00:24:16.661 --> 00:24:25.740
calls the spirit of religion.
Yet, obviously, all is not well.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:30.556
All is far from being well.
Too often, way too often we

00:24:30.556 --> 00:24:34.670
read Democracy in America
as it if were simply a

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:38.860
celebration of the democratic
experience in America.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.076
It is not.
Tocqueville,

00:24:41.076 --> 00:24:44.667
among other things,
is deeply worried about the

00:24:44.667 --> 00:24:48.960
potential, I mentioned briefly
about this last time,

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.549
the potential of a democratic
tyranny.

00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:57.960
Why is there a belief or why
would one believe that the

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:03.771
democratic government alone will
eliminate various forms of

00:25:03.771 --> 00:25:08.180
arbitrary rule in tyrannical
government?

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:12.040
In fact, it might create new
forms of tyranny,

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:16.758
democratic tyranny of which
previous societies had been,

00:25:16.758 --> 00:25:21.252
perhaps, unaware.
This is an issue that he treats

00:25:21.252 --> 00:25:24.900
twice in two important parts in
his work;

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:28.289
one in Volume 1,
the other in Volume 2.

00:25:28.289 --> 00:25:32.507
I'm going to talk for a little
bit today about his account of

00:25:32.507 --> 00:25:36.444
tyranny of the majority in
Volume 1 and I'm going to save

00:25:36.444 --> 00:25:40.592
the rest of the discussion for
next week when he talks about

00:25:40.592 --> 00:25:44.599
what he calls "democratic
despotism" in the second part of

00:25:44.599 --> 00:25:48.055
Democracy in America.
In Volume 1,

00:25:48.055 --> 00:25:52.067
he treats what he calls the
"tyranny of the majority"

00:25:52.067 --> 00:25:54.482
largely in terms,
you might say,

00:25:54.482 --> 00:25:57.971
that are derived or inherited
from Aristotle and even the

00:25:57.971 --> 00:26:00.650
authors of The Federalist
Papers.

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:03.646
As you remember in Aristotle's
Politics,

00:26:03.646 --> 00:26:07.490
Aristotle associated democracy
with the rule of the many.

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:10.904
"Rule of the many," for all
kinds of purposes,

00:26:10.904 --> 00:26:15.154
generally means rule of the
poor and rule of the poor for

00:26:15.154 --> 00:26:19.326
their own interest.
The danger with democracy for

00:26:19.326 --> 00:26:24.094
Aristotle was that it still
represented the tyranny of one

00:26:24.094 --> 00:26:28.109
class of society over the
society of a whole,

00:26:28.109 --> 00:26:32.750
the largest class ruling in its
interests over the minority.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:37.623
Democracy for the ancients was
always a form of class struggle

00:26:37.623 --> 00:26:41.699
between the rich and the poor.
That was, in many respects,

00:26:41.699 --> 00:26:45.188
the way in which democracy came
to be viewed even by The

00:26:45.188 --> 00:26:48.677
Federalist's authors who
came up with their own solution

00:26:48.677 --> 00:26:51.940
to the problem of democracy or
what they called "republican

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.581
government."
The problem of republican

00:26:54.581 --> 00:26:57.410
government was this problem of,
you might say,

00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:00.553
majority faction and their
answer to the problem of

00:27:00.553 --> 00:27:03.319
majority faction was in
Madison's term,

00:27:03.319 --> 00:27:07.077
"to enlarge the orbit of
government," to make societies

00:27:07.077 --> 00:27:10.974
and polities much larger in
order not to try to eliminate

00:27:10.974 --> 00:27:13.640
faction,
but to increase them.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.883
By increasing the number of
factions, you decrease the

00:27:17.883 --> 00:27:22.686
possibility that any one of them
will be able to represent or

00:27:22.686 --> 00:27:26.690
exercise a kind of permanent
majority control,

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:29.789
a kind of permanent tyranny of
the majority.

00:27:29.789 --> 00:27:33.377
The greater the number of
factions, the less likelihood

00:27:33.377 --> 00:27:37.296
that any one of them will be
able to exercise despotic power

00:27:37.296 --> 00:27:40.577
over national politics.
This is a question that

00:27:40.577 --> 00:27:44.198
Tocqueville returns to or turns
to in that very important

00:27:44.198 --> 00:27:48.079
chapter from book one called
"The omnipotence of the majority

00:27:48.079 --> 00:27:50.859
in the United States and its
Effects,"

00:27:50.859 --> 00:27:54.887
which is, in many respects,
a response or provides his

00:27:54.887 --> 00:27:59.294
reading and critique of the
classical or traditional theory

00:27:59.294 --> 00:28:01.941
of democratic tyranny.
The U.S.

00:28:01.941 --> 00:28:04.291
constitution,
he talks about,

00:28:04.291 --> 00:28:08.572
has enshrined the majority in
its own Preamble--"We,

00:28:08.572 --> 00:28:12.286
the People."
It has enshrined the majority

00:28:12.286 --> 00:28:16.779
even as it has sought to limit
the powers of the people.

00:28:16.779 --> 00:28:20.473
Although Tocqueville devotes a
great deal of attention in

00:28:20.473 --> 00:28:23.970
Volume 1-- we're not really
reading these sections,

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:28.023
I don't think they're all that
important for our purposes--he

00:28:28.023 --> 00:28:32.145
spends a great deal of attention
simply sort of describing the

00:28:32.145 --> 00:28:34.779
makeup of the federal
constitution,

00:28:34.779 --> 00:28:37.740
the structure of the Houses of
government and so on.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:41.870
One has to say he is far less
impressed than Madison or the

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:47.794
Federalist authors were,
that the problem of majority

00:28:47.794 --> 00:28:52.390
faction has been solved in
America.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:55.732
Again, the Federalist
authors, following Locke and

00:28:55.732 --> 00:28:59.373
Montesquieu, believed all that
was necessary was separation of

00:28:59.373 --> 00:29:02.072
powers,
a system of representation,

00:29:02.072 --> 00:29:06.082
a system of checks and
balances, that this could serve

00:29:06.082 --> 00:29:09.259
as an effective check on
majority rule.

00:29:09.259 --> 00:29:12.509
But Tocqueville was less
certain of that.

00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:16.143
He was less certain that these,
as it were, institutional

00:29:16.143 --> 00:29:19.841
devices alone could check what
he calls the "empire of the

00:29:19.841 --> 00:29:22.620
majority."
The empire of the majority,

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.431
a term that he uses that
clearly has kind of theological

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:29.491
connotations,
denoting a kind of divine

00:29:29.491 --> 00:29:34.096
omnipotence, that the people
have come to be the ultimate or

00:29:34.096 --> 00:29:37.130
final authority.
Rather than regarding,

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:40.865
as it were, the people in
Madisonian terms simply as a

00:29:40.865 --> 00:29:44.460
kind of ongoing shifting
coalition of interests,

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:48.643
Tocqueville regarded the
majority in democratic

00:29:48.643 --> 00:29:52.190
societies, the power of the
majority,

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:58.054
as unlimited and unstoppable.
Legal guarantees of minority

00:29:58.054 --> 00:30:02.293
rights, he thought,
were unlikely to be ineffective

00:30:02.293 --> 00:30:05.940
in the face of mobilized public
opinion.

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:10.743
Why does Tocqueville believe
that, or what led him to express

00:30:10.743 --> 00:30:15.227
such skepticism about even
American democracy's inability

00:30:15.227 --> 00:30:19.069
to check the prospect of
democratic tyranny?

00:30:19.069 --> 00:30:23.040
In part, I think,
Tocqueville's answer was that

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:27.442
majority tyranny was inseparable
from the threats of

00:30:27.442 --> 00:30:31.758
revolutionary violence and
particularly charismatic

00:30:31.758 --> 00:30:36.764
demagogues and military leaders
like Napoleon in France and

00:30:36.764 --> 00:30:40.390
America's counterpart to
Napoleon,

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:44.649
Andrew Jackson.
Napoleon was in France,

00:30:44.649 --> 00:30:50.075
the man capable of mobilizing
the masses into fits of

00:30:50.075 --> 00:30:54.039
patriotic zeal and to carry on
war.

00:30:54.039 --> 00:30:58.048
Jacksonianism,
for him, simply looked like an

00:30:58.048 --> 00:31:03.422
American form of Bonapartism,
a military commander riding to

00:31:03.422 --> 00:31:08.160
political power on the wings of
popular support.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:12.460
More than anything else,
Tocqueville feared militarism

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.759
combined with a kind of
unlimited patriotic fervor.

00:31:16.759 --> 00:31:21.399
It is in these respects you can
begin to see some of the less

00:31:21.399 --> 00:31:25.574
ennobling features of the
democratic experience and the

00:31:25.574 --> 00:31:29.440
more ominous possibilities of
democratic rule.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.115
The power of the majority,
he says, makes itself feared

00:31:33.115 --> 00:31:36.789
especially through the dominance
of the legislature.

00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:39.745
He believed,
we could talk about whether

00:31:39.745 --> 00:31:42.549
this belief is still valid or
true,

00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:47.344
he believed that the most,
again, that democracy tends

00:31:47.344 --> 00:31:52.500
towards a dominance of the
legislatures where the people's

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:56.480
voice makes its will most
clearly known.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.459
By having short elections or
short cycles every two years in

00:32:00.459 --> 00:32:05.020
the House of Representatives,
it was a way of making sure

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:09.047
that the legislatures,
the House, the Houses,

00:32:09.047 --> 00:32:14.079
are very close to public
opinion and public control.

00:32:14.079 --> 00:32:18.817
He sees this as a dangerous
thing, this kind of legislative

00:32:18.817 --> 00:32:23.474
dominance that he sees is one
form in the way in which the

00:32:23.474 --> 00:32:27.150
tyranny of the majority
expresses itself.

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:32.363
But the most important and the
most memorable aspects of

00:32:32.363 --> 00:32:37.008
tyranny of the majority have
less to do with these

00:32:37.008 --> 00:32:40.799
institutional forms,
you might, say.

00:32:40.799 --> 00:32:45.228
It has to do with the way in
which the empire--again,

00:32:45.228 --> 00:32:50.167
I'll use his term-- the empire
of the majority makes itself

00:32:50.167 --> 00:32:54.000
felt in the realm of thought and
opinion,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.910
the influence of the majority
over thought.

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:03.739
In an always startling passage
from the book,

00:33:03.739 --> 00:33:07.829
Tocqueville remarks,
"I know of no other country

00:33:07.829 --> 00:33:11.270
where,
in general, less independence

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:16.056
of mind and genuine freedom of
discussion reign than in

00:33:16.056 --> 00:33:18.654
America."
There's no country where there

00:33:18.654 --> 00:33:21.520
is less independence of mind and
freedom of discussion.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:28.361
He is, I suspect,
overstating the case,

00:33:28.361 --> 00:33:32.497
but his argument here is that
the dangers to freedom of

00:33:32.497 --> 00:33:36.711
thought in a democracy do not
come from the threat of an

00:33:36.711 --> 00:33:41.228
inquisition.
They do not come from something

00:33:41.228 --> 00:33:46.593
like that, but they are
exercised in more subtle forms

00:33:46.593 --> 00:33:50.725
of exclusion and ostracism.
Tocqueville is,

00:33:50.725 --> 00:33:54.375
perhaps, in that passage,
one of the first and most

00:33:54.375 --> 00:33:58.609
perceptive analysts of what
today might be called the power

00:33:58.609 --> 00:34:03.428
of political correctness,
to control and to eliminate

00:34:03.428 --> 00:34:08.880
certain kinds of ideas and
opinions from being thought.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.627
It is the fear of ostracism,
in some sense,

00:34:12.627 --> 00:34:17.446
the fear of being socially
ostracized through which the

00:34:17.446 --> 00:34:23.227
majority exercises its control.
Tocqueville's statement here

00:34:23.227 --> 00:34:27.402
is, of course,
that persecution can take many

00:34:27.402 --> 00:34:33.191
forms under a democratic people,
from the cruelest to the most

00:34:33.191 --> 00:34:36.212
mild.
He gives various examples of

00:34:36.212 --> 00:34:40.209
the crueler forms of the way in
which the majority have

00:34:40.209 --> 00:34:44.201
expressed itself.
In a lengthy footnote to the

00:34:44.201 --> 00:34:47.877
book, for example,
in some of these parts,

00:34:47.877 --> 00:34:52.969
he gives two examples;
one in which during the War of

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:57.909
1812, he says there were some
anti-war journalists in

00:34:57.909 --> 00:35:03.800
Baltimore--maybe you read that
passage--who were taken out.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:10.220
Their newspaper press was burnt
down and I think they were hung,

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:13.436
he says.
This is a way in which mob

00:35:13.436 --> 00:35:17.497
mentality took over.
He also uses the example of the

00:35:17.497 --> 00:35:21.630
way in which black voters in the
state of Pennsylvania,

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:23.957
and he focuses on this
particularly,

00:35:23.957 --> 00:35:27.651
have been disenfranchised.
He mentions Pennsylvania in

00:35:27.651 --> 00:35:31.110
particular because Pennsylvania
is a Quaker state,

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:35.044
that is to say a state where
one would have thought liberal

00:35:35.044 --> 00:35:38.978
opinion towards questions of
racial justice would have been

00:35:38.978 --> 00:35:42.459
most advanced.
Even there, he says,

00:35:42.459 --> 00:35:48.446
the majority constrained
African American voters from,

00:35:48.446 --> 00:35:51.610
free blacks,
from voting.

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:57.541
So these are ways in which,
again, some overt and cruel and

00:35:57.541 --> 00:36:03.574
persecutory, others milder and
through the form of ostracism

00:36:03.574 --> 00:36:08.790
that he wants to say that
democratic sovereignty can

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:13.051
exercise itself.
"Chains and executions are the

00:36:13.051 --> 00:36:16.605
coarse instruments," he writes,
"that tyranny formerly

00:36:16.605 --> 00:36:18.472
employed.
But in our day,

00:36:18.472 --> 00:36:21.519
civilization has perfected
despotism itself,

00:36:21.519 --> 00:36:24.849
which seemed to have nothing
more to learn."

00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:27.099
We have perfected despotism,
he says.

00:36:27.099 --> 00:36:31.489
"Under the absolute government
of one man, despotism struck

00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:34.820
crudely at the body so to reach
the soul,"

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:38.521
no doubt thinking about the
Inquisition and things like this

00:36:38.521 --> 00:36:41.219
in Spain and in parts of
Catholic Europe.

00:36:41.219 --> 00:36:44.801
He writes, "and the soul
escaping from those blows rose

00:36:44.801 --> 00:36:47.250
gloriously above it.
But," he goes,

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:50.930
"in democratic republics,
tyranny does not proceed in

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:54.373
this way.
It leaves the body alone and

00:36:54.373 --> 00:36:59.592
goes directly for the soul."
Well, there's a wealth of

00:36:59.592 --> 00:37:05.468
commentary you might think about
when you read that passage

00:37:05.468 --> 00:37:09.670
that's implied there.
Oh, God.

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:12.920
The time's moving so quickly.
There's so much more.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:19.724
So that, for Tocqueville,
is one of the other sides of

00:37:19.724 --> 00:37:25.232
the democratic experience.
Again, I want to return to a

00:37:25.232 --> 00:37:28.237
piece of that on Wednesday,
next week rather,

00:37:28.237 --> 00:37:30.887
Monday,
because I think you will see in

00:37:30.887 --> 00:37:34.570
Volume 2, Tocqueville has
something of a change of heart.

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:36.400
He doesn't become more
optimistic.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.929
In fact, he becomes far more
pessimistic about this.

00:37:38.929 --> 00:37:44.846
But there's certainly a change
of tone in what Tocqueville has

00:37:44.846 --> 00:37:49.889
to say about the potentiality of
majority tyranny.

00:37:49.889 --> 00:37:52.092
Well, we had so much fun
watching the movie,

00:37:52.092 --> 00:37:55.320
I didn't get a chance--There's
a little more I wanted to say,

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.070
but this seems like a good note
to break on.

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:01.824
I'll try to finish whatever I
can with Tocqueville on Monday

00:38:01.824 --> 00:38:05.642
and Wednesday I'm going to try
to wrap things up and tell you

00:38:05.642 --> 00:38:08.059
what you should be thinking
about.

00:38:08.059 --> 00:38:13.000
So anyway, enjoy yourselves and
I'll see you next week.

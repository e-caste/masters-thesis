00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.465
Professor Langdon
Hammer: Langston Hughes is

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:16.400
our subject today.
 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.420
 
 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.560
Let's start with a poem you
probably know.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.790
It's on page 687.
 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:36.578
It's really the poem for which
Hughes is perhaps most known and

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:40.948
was first known.
He composed it when he was

00:00:40.948 --> 00:00:42.570
eighteen years old.
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.610
It is "The Negro Speaks of
Rivers."

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.585
You can see that it's dedicated
to W.E.B.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:56.340
Dubois.
Dubois was the important leader

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.814
and speaker who was the editor
of the magazine The

00:01:02.814 --> 00:01:07.920
Crisis, which published this
poem.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.580
And The Crisis had a
circulation of 100,000 readers

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.030
at least, if not more,
and is in that way quite a

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.599
debut to have.
And it put Hughes immediately

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:29.786
in a political magazine,
in a race magazine,

00:01:29.786 --> 00:01:32.900
and in some ways in a popular
magazine,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.680
not one of the little magazines
of modernism.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.313
I've known rivers:
I've known rivers ancient as

00:01:44.313 --> 00:01:48.190
the world and older than the
flow of human

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.330
blood in human veins.
 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.500
My soul has grown deep like the
rivers.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.189
I bathed in the Euphrates when
dawns were young.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.219
I built my hut near the Congo
and it lulled me to sleep.

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:13.349
I looked upon the Nile and
raised the pyramids above it.

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.868
I heard the singing of the
Mississippi when Abe Lincoln

00:02:17.868 --> 00:02:20.011
went down to
New Orleans,

00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:25.110
and I've seen its muddy bosom
turned all golden in the sunset.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.530
I've known rivers:
Ancient, dusky rivers.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.430
My soul has grown deep like the
rivers.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.510
Hughes's speaker is a
particularized voice,

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.603
an "I," at the same time that
he is a general one,

00:02:51.603 --> 00:02:59.135
"The Negro."
The Negro speaks of and for a

00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:05.610
people, as a representative
figure.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.591
Like Hart Crane,
Hughes returns to Walt Whitman,

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:19.099
Walt Whitman in his ambition to
speak of and for America.

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.463
At the same time,
unlike Crane,

00:03:22.463 --> 00:03:28.855
Hughes takes on Whitman's
versification – Whitman's ways

00:03:28.855 --> 00:03:32.878
of making a line,
his free verse,

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:39.662
his paratactic style in which
things are listed – as opposed

00:03:39.662 --> 00:03:44.444
to Crane's crumpled and
condensed quatrains,

00:03:44.444 --> 00:03:48.892
stanzas.
Here, the relation between the

00:03:48.892 --> 00:03:54.396
particular and the general,
between the individual and a

00:03:54.396 --> 00:03:58.300
type, is one of the poem's
subjects.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.240
It is a poem about knowledge,
about identity,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.480
and about history,
too.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.759
What the "I" knows is rivers.
 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:15.840
We learn just a few things
about those rivers.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.760
They are ancient as the world.
 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.329
They are primordial.
 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.256
They are even,
it seems, prior to the human in

00:04:24.256 --> 00:04:29.840
this sense, prior to human blood
which conventionally is a way of

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.540
representing race,
of speaking about race.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:41.185
So, the rivers are older it
seems than any race,

00:04:41.185 --> 00:04:49.670
and yet they're also an image
of racial blood and flowing.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.535
Hughes is writing about a
universal from a particular

00:04:55.535 --> 00:05:00.226
point of view.
The flowing of rivers is like

00:05:00.226 --> 00:05:03.610
the flowing of blood in the
poem.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.497
And to know them is to know
what is under or inside

00:05:08.497 --> 00:05:13.579
particular racial experience at
the deepest level.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:17.947
In this sense,
we might paraphrase that title,

00:05:17.947 --> 00:05:23.771
"The Negro Speaks of Human Life
and History, as The Negro Has

00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:27.178
Known It."
It's a poem concerned with

00:05:27.178 --> 00:05:31.354
human life and history,
the very most general terms of

00:05:31.354 --> 00:05:36.240
experience from the particular
perspective of the black speaker

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.180
and from the perspective of
black experience.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.041
As the poem goes on,
the rivers are named and

00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:49.240
localized in history:
the Euphrates,

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.008
origin of civilization and the
site of the Jewish captivity in

00:05:54.008 --> 00:05:57.709
Babylon;
the Congo evoking Africa and

00:05:57.709 --> 00:06:01.720
its people;
the Nile, site of the pyramids,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.261
those archetypal human
monuments, fixed in place and

00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:11.248
pointed to the sky and in that
sense counter-posed to the

00:06:11.248 --> 00:06:15.038
flowing river.
Being The Negro here means

00:06:15.038 --> 00:06:17.379
knowing all of these places.
 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:25.313
The poem begins interestingly
in the perfect present tense:

00:06:25.313 --> 00:06:33.110
"I've known," "I've known";
"My soul has grown."

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.855
This is an interesting tense
that evokes simultaneously the

00:06:37.855 --> 00:06:41.864
past and the present,
suggests a past carried over

00:06:41.864 --> 00:06:43.910
and into the present.
 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:50.470
Then in that third stanza,
the poem shifts into the simple

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:56.569
past: "I bathed," "I built," "I
looked," "I heard."

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:59.646
The Mississippi,
the line about the Mississippi,

00:06:59.646 --> 00:07:03.770
continues this pattern but then
in the middle of the line breaks

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.567
out of it: "I heard the singing
of the Mississippi when Abe

00:07:07.567 --> 00:07:10.120
Lincoln went down to New
Orleans,

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.589
and I've seen its muddy bosom
turn all golden in the sunset."

00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:21.561
There's a way in which the
story of Lincoln and the freeing

00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:27.842
of the slaves that Hughes gets
to at that point seems to break

00:07:27.842 --> 00:07:34.123
out of the particular and then
reach into this perfect present

00:07:34.123 --> 00:07:39.579
tense to evoke some kind of
ongoing experience,

00:07:39.579 --> 00:07:42.779
moving from the past to the
present again.

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:53.699
And then the poem goes back
into that perfect present.

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:58.972
There's a sense of past action
that is ongoing,

00:07:58.972 --> 00:08:02.870
and active, present in the
poem.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.610
The rivers, they're "deep,"
dark, "dusky."

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.991
They also, at this pivotal
moment in the poem,

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:15.713
turn "golden."
The poem projects a view of

00:08:15.713 --> 00:08:20.522
black history in which to be
black means simultaneously to be

00:08:20.522 --> 00:08:24.529
the product of black experience
across history,

00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:29.366
at particular moments –
particular moments,

00:08:29.366 --> 00:08:35.083
particular times – and also
involved in the deepest

00:08:35.083 --> 00:08:39.809
trans-historical meanings of the
human.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:44.805
The journey that the poem
describes links different times

00:08:44.805 --> 00:08:49.889
and places and ultimately white
and black when Lincoln,

00:08:49.889 --> 00:08:55.809
America's white President,
goes down to New Orleans and

00:08:55.809 --> 00:08:58.659
resolves to end slavery.
 

00:08:58.659 --> 00:09:09.559
This is a remarkable poem for a
young man to write.

00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:13.110
Let me hold up this interesting
photo for a second.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:21.388
This is a picture of Hughes
still in the mid-twenties when

00:09:21.388 --> 00:09:28.649
his work was just being read for
the first time.

00:09:28.649 --> 00:09:33.869
It's a remarkable poem,
I think, for a young poet to

00:09:33.869 --> 00:09:37.258
begin with.
You could compare it to other

00:09:37.258 --> 00:09:41.304
early, sort of inaugurating or
initiating poems that we've

00:09:41.304 --> 00:09:45.407
talked about,
such as Crane's "Legend" or

00:09:45.407 --> 00:09:47.605
"The Love Song of J.
 

00:09:47.605 --> 00:09:53.980
Alfred Prufrock" and other
sorts of entries into poetry.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:58.562
We could compare its vision of
the past, too,

00:09:58.562 --> 00:10:03.769
to that which we find in
perhaps Pound or Eliot,

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:09.422
which leads me to this general
question of how do we place

00:10:09.422 --> 00:10:15.173
Langston Hughes in this course
and more generally how do we

00:10:15.173 --> 00:10:21.122
position the black language and
experience in his work in the

00:10:21.122 --> 00:10:24.990
general context of modern
poetry?

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:31.559
Where else in this course does
The Negro speak?

00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:39.575
Have you seen black people or
heard black voices in other

00:10:39.575 --> 00:10:43.322
poems?
Blackness figures in Frost,

00:10:43.322 --> 00:10:47.467
interestingly,
as a kind of charged symbolic

00:10:47.467 --> 00:10:52.480
color but in a very generalized
way that isn't linked

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.147
immediately to race,
although it certainly could be

00:10:57.147 --> 00:10:59.330
seen to in certain contexts.
 

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.779
You could say the same thing,
I think, about Stevens;

00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:06.606
although, you do,
in Stevens, encounter certain

00:11:06.606 --> 00:11:09.311
black figures,
including the word "nigger" in

00:11:09.311 --> 00:11:12.873
one poem.
There's no question,

00:11:12.873 --> 00:11:21.440
though, that in Stevens and in
Frost, the poetry doesn't aspire

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.988
to,
doesn't pretend to,

00:11:23.988 --> 00:11:28.240
represent the experience of
African Americans.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.781
Marianne Moore,
whom we'll read soon,

00:11:32.781 --> 00:11:37.070
has a poem called "Black
Earth."

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.386
When Ezra Pound read it,
he wrote to her and asked,

00:11:40.386 --> 00:11:44.101
since he didn't know – he had
never met her – was she

00:11:44.101 --> 00:11:48.879
Ethiopian?
This is a truly crazy question

00:11:48.879 --> 00:11:51.960
but an interesting one.
 

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:56.768
In this poem Moore speaks about
an elephant and from the point

00:11:56.768 --> 00:12:01.261
of view of an elephant in ways
that might seem to possibly

00:12:01.261 --> 00:12:06.780
speak for black people,
but only on the level of fable

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:10.909
or allegory.
Crane comes closer.

00:12:10.909 --> 00:12:16.045
If you turn back a few pages in
your anthology to the Crane

00:12:16.045 --> 00:12:21.093
section, the first poem in that
selection is called "Black

00:12:21.093 --> 00:12:24.909
Tambourine."
That's on page 607.

00:12:24.909 --> 00:12:29.385
That poem describes,
again, a kind of symbolic,

00:12:29.385 --> 00:12:35.224
generalized type of the black
man as a figure trapped in what

00:12:35.224 --> 00:12:40.867
Crane called a "mid-kingdom" in
popular imagination – the

00:12:40.867 --> 00:12:44.759
mid-kingdom between man and
beast.

00:12:44.759 --> 00:12:50.244
Crane sees the black
entertainer as a kind of figure

00:12:50.244 --> 00:12:54.546
of the artist,
something like his tramps,

00:12:54.546 --> 00:12:58.309
his wanderers,
Charlie Chaplin.

00:12:58.309 --> 00:13:03.337
Crane had initially intended to
include in "The Bridge" a

00:13:03.337 --> 00:13:08.186
section that was to be a
dramatic monologue spoken by a

00:13:08.186 --> 00:13:10.700
Negro porter on a train.
 

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:15.578
That plan fell away,
but there are still traces of

00:13:15.578 --> 00:13:21.850
that intention in his section of
the poem called "The River,"

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:28.595
which tries to evoke aspects of
black experience,

00:13:28.595 --> 00:13:32.389
to integrate jazz,
blues,

00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:38.283
and spirituals into Crane's
poetry and make them part of the

00:13:38.283 --> 00:13:41.679
history that "The Bridge" tells.
 

00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:46.957
Crane might have had as one
model for the inclusion of

00:13:46.957 --> 00:13:51.637
African-American expressive
forms, surprisingly,

00:13:51.637 --> 00:13:54.721
perhaps, Eliot.
When "O O O O that

00:13:54.721 --> 00:13:58.295
Shakespeherian Rag"--when that
breaks into The Waste

00:13:58.295 --> 00:14:02.095
Land,
jazz and a distinctively

00:14:02.095 --> 00:14:07.980
African-American form also enter
Eliot's poem.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:12.902
Eliot was writing,
however, from the point of view

00:14:12.902 --> 00:14:17.423
of white Europe,
and blacks tend not to figure

00:14:17.423 --> 00:14:23.149
in his poetry except perhaps as
figures of otherness,

00:14:23.149 --> 00:14:28.935
those perhaps hooded hoards
that swarm across the plains in

00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:31.330
The Waste Land.
 

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:36.826
The Beinecke includes in its
Ezra Pound Papers an interesting

00:14:36.826 --> 00:14:42.048
selection of poems published
with Eliot's juvenilia not so

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:45.512
long ago;
a selection of poems that

00:14:45.512 --> 00:14:51.149
circulated between Pound and
Eliot and certain other friends,

00:14:51.149 --> 00:14:56.330
which are obscene racist
limericks that Eliot wrote about

00:14:56.330 --> 00:15:00.850
King Bolo and his big,
black, bastard queen.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:04.726
This, too, is part of Eliot's
oeuvre, though not part of the

00:15:04.726 --> 00:15:09.825
public form of it,
and it's important information

00:15:09.825 --> 00:15:17.522
about at least one way in which
black life figured in the high

00:15:17.522 --> 00:15:23.200
modernist imagination of Eliot
and others.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:30.139
Here's that photo I started to
show a moment ago.

00:15:30.139 --> 00:15:35.931
I suppose Hughes is the only
modernist poet who begins as a

00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:41.180
busboy.
This is a photo from 1925,

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:50.886
taken at the Wardman Park Hotel
for a newspaper story about

00:15:50.886 --> 00:15:53.898
Hughes.
Hughes had been,

00:15:53.898 --> 00:15:57.831
it seems, discovered by the
poet Vachel Lindsay,

00:15:57.831 --> 00:16:01.433
at lunch when Hughes,
or so the anecdote goes,

00:16:01.433 --> 00:16:04.288
presented his poems to Lindsay,
and Lindsay,

00:16:04.288 --> 00:16:08.025
taken with them,
went on to read them that night

00:16:08.025 --> 00:16:10.659
at a reading Lindsay was giving.
 

00:16:10.659 --> 00:16:14.904
Of course, this was all
carefully orchestrated by

00:16:14.904 --> 00:16:16.842
Hughes.
If he's a busboy,

00:16:16.842 --> 00:16:19.530
he is also a poet and
wants--he's really,

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:23.091
in a sense, almost in costume
there and posing for the

00:16:23.091 --> 00:16:24.570
newspaper photos.
 

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:30.141
But it's an interesting and
important image of the man

00:16:30.141 --> 00:16:36.658
Hughes was as he began to write
poems like "The Negro Speaks of

00:16:36.658 --> 00:16:41.419
Rivers."
If white poetry turns away from

00:16:41.419 --> 00:16:48.080
African-American people and
their experience in modernism,

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:56.870
Hughes also himself intended to
turn away from white poetry.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:01.288
"The Negro Artist and the
Racial Mountain," that prose

00:17:01.288 --> 00:17:06.206
piece I've asked you to read at
the end of your anthology on

00:17:06.206 --> 00:17:10.710
page 964,
makes this argument very

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:16.109
forcefully.
It begins by Hughes contrasting

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:23.011
his own intention as an artist
with that of one of the most

00:17:23.011 --> 00:17:28.009
promising of the young Negro
poets who,

00:17:28.009 --> 00:17:34.961
as Hughes interprets his
ambition, wants to be like a

00:17:34.961 --> 00:17:42.180
white poet and in that sense
would like to be white.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:47.740
Hughes is writing here about
Countee Cullen,

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:54.852
a rival artist whose work you
can sample on page 727 and

00:17:54.852 --> 00:17:58.990
following in your anthology.
 

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:07.169
Hughes wants to get out of the
curious condition of wanting to

00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:14.409
"write white," so to speak,
by redefining what it would

00:18:14.409 --> 00:18:18.029
mean to sing in poetry.
 

00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:26.670
On page 965 he juxtaposes two
black audiences:

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:37.230
one what he calls "self-styled
'high-class' Negroes,"

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:45.016
that represent bourgeois norms
or the aspiration to them and

00:18:45.016 --> 00:18:51.220
that seek what Hughes calls
"Nordic" culture;

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:57.667
and he contrasts them rather to
another expression of black life

00:18:57.667 --> 00:19:01.250
with which he identifies
himself.

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:03.656
…[These]
are the low-down folks,

00:19:03.656 --> 00:19:07.236
the so-called common element,
and they are the majority [he

00:19:07.236 --> 00:19:09.519
writes]--may the Lord be
praised!

00:19:09.519 --> 00:19:13.241
The people who have their nip
of gin on Saturday nights and

00:19:13.241 --> 00:19:16.769
are not too important to
themselves or the community,

00:19:16.769 --> 00:19:20.712
or too well fed,
or too learned to watch the

00:19:20.712 --> 00:19:22.730
lazy world go round.
 

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.915
They live on Seventh Street in
Washington or State Street in

00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:28.776
Chicago and they do not
particularly care whether they

00:19:28.776 --> 00:19:30.990
are like white folks or anybody
else.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:32.650
Their joy runs, bang!
 

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:36.420
into ecstasy.
Their religion soars to a shout.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.790
Work maybe a little today,
rest a little tomorrow.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:41.590
Play awhile.
Sing awhile.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:45.661
O, let's dance!
These common people are not

00:19:45.661 --> 00:19:48.859
afraid of spirituals as for a
long time their more

00:19:48.859 --> 00:19:52.840
intellectual brethren were,
and jazz is their child.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:57.269
And he continues.
 

00:19:57.269 --> 00:20:03.455
He juxtaposes ecstasy,
shouting, and jazz against what

00:20:03.455 --> 00:20:08.589
he calls here "American
standardizations."

00:20:08.589 --> 00:20:12.379
They furnish a wealth of
colorful distinctive material

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:16.740
for any artist because they
still hold their individuality,

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:23.099
their individuality in the face
of American standardizations.

00:20:23.099 --> 00:20:26.672
And perhaps these common
people will give to the world

00:20:26.672 --> 00:20:30.927
its truly great Negro artist,
the one who is not afraid to be

00:20:30.927 --> 00:20:33.765
himself [and which I,
Langston Hughes,

00:20:33.765 --> 00:20:39.850
aspire to be].
These are important statements.

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:46.309
They show Hughes's ambitions;
they show him positioning

00:20:46.309 --> 00:20:51.212
himself in relation to another
African-American writer,

00:20:51.212 --> 00:20:55.569
other African-American
audiences for culture.

00:20:55.569 --> 00:21:00.857
In making the move that he is
doing here – a move that's

00:21:00.857 --> 00:21:06.329
really deeply influential in
African-American literature and

00:21:06.329 --> 00:21:10.019
poetry,
which as a whole descends from

00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:15.359
Hughes rather than from Countee
Cullen – Hughes is still,

00:21:15.359 --> 00:21:18.128
however, doing something
similar, after all,

00:21:18.128 --> 00:21:22.119
to the other modern poets we've
been reading in this course.

00:21:22.119 --> 00:21:28.950
And I want to suggest some of
the continuities between Hughes

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.910
and these other writers.
 

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:36.718
Like Yeats, for example,
Hughes wanted to be a

00:21:36.718 --> 00:21:41.740
representative figure,
to speak for a people;

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:47.594
and we speak of the Irish
Renaissance just as we speak of

00:21:47.594 --> 00:21:53.030
the Harlem Renaissance,
of which Hughes was a central

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:55.717
figure.
Like Williams,

00:21:55.717 --> 00:22:00.439
like Moore, like Crane,
and like Frost also,

00:22:00.439 --> 00:22:06.480
Hughes was very conscious of
being an American poet,

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:11.380
eschewing European examples,
for the most part,

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:17.240
and seeking to bring into
poetry lives and language that

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:22.779
had not been seen previously as
poetic material.

00:22:22.779 --> 00:22:28.365
At the same time,
like Pound and like Eliot,

00:22:28.365 --> 00:22:34.859
Hughes was interested in a long
historical view,

00:22:34.859 --> 00:22:39.170
and he makes links between
people of different times and

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:42.070
places in what was a global
vision,

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:45.849
for Hughes, of history.
 

00:22:45.849 --> 00:22:51.010
Like Crane, Hughes published
his first book in 1926,

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:53.539
The Weary Blues.
 

00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:57.599
Like Crane, Hughes is--you
could call him a

00:22:57.599 --> 00:23:00.500
second-generation modernist.
 

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:07.592
He's consciously coming after
figures like Eliot and Pound,

00:23:07.592 --> 00:23:12.240
and Yeats and Frost for that
matter.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.198
This book, too,
is published by Knopf,

00:23:16.198 --> 00:23:20.799
Alfred Knopf:
publisher of Wallace Stevens's

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:24.329
first book, Harmonium.
 

00:23:24.329 --> 00:23:27.623
So, Hughes is,
in that way,

00:23:27.623 --> 00:23:34.716
very much part of the same New
York poetry world in which

00:23:34.716 --> 00:23:40.670
Stevens and Crane and others are
appearing.

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:47.437
Like Frost, Hughes wanted to
get vernacular speech into

00:23:47.437 --> 00:23:52.586
poetry, and like Frost,
Hughes for the most part did

00:23:52.586 --> 00:23:56.690
not write for Little Magazines,
but rather popular ones,

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:58.509
as I was suggesting.
 

00:23:58.509 --> 00:24:02.494
In fact, both Frost and Hughes
went on to make a living in

00:24:02.494 --> 00:24:05.849
poetry, and they have a kind of
national fame,

00:24:05.849 --> 00:24:11.827
a general readership that
really none of our other poets

00:24:11.827 --> 00:24:16.576
did.
Like Pound, like Yeats in the

00:24:16.576 --> 00:24:25.333
teens, Hughes is interested in
what he calls "a naked style," a

00:24:25.333 --> 00:24:29.430
kind of ascetic aesthetic.
 

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:36.490
Like the other poets we've been
reading, Hughes is a city poet.

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:40.962
He's a metropolitan poet,
and he styles himself,

00:24:40.962 --> 00:24:45.720
as we've just seen,
against middle-class tastes and

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.289
norms and expectations.
 

00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:52.483
And importantly,
like the other moderns,

00:24:52.483 --> 00:24:57.859
he finds no consolation in
traditional religion,

00:24:57.859 --> 00:25:06.289
even while he sometimes works
with spirituals and often evokes

00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:10.849
Christian motifs in his poetry.
 

00:25:10.849 --> 00:25:12.878
In all these ways,
Hughes is, I think,

00:25:12.878 --> 00:25:15.509
helpful to read at this point
in the semester,

00:25:15.509 --> 00:25:18.976
partly because his affinities
with the other moderns,

00:25:18.976 --> 00:25:21.309
once you start to recognize
them,

00:25:21.309 --> 00:25:24.500
help us to see a kind of whole
picture.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:31.019
But then, just having said
that, we have to start talking

00:25:31.019 --> 00:25:34.279
about Hughes's difference.
 

00:25:34.279 --> 00:25:40.490
If he is an American poet,
he is just as importantly an

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:43.250
African-American poet.
 

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:48.658
If he is an internationalist,
like Pound and Eliot,

00:25:48.658 --> 00:25:54.174
he's interested in the
international struggle of the

00:25:54.174 --> 00:25:57.960
worker and the oppressed races.
 

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:06.089
This is Hughes writing about a
journey to Cuba that he made.

00:26:06.089 --> 00:26:10.946
He traveled,
particularly in the thirties,

00:26:10.946 --> 00:26:16.395
frequently as a kind of
representative of black

00:26:16.395 --> 00:26:22.910
Americans sponsored by left
groups and traveled to,

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:29.130
well, Soviet Russia,
among other places.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:34.807
If Hughes's style is stripped
down and naked,

00:26:34.807 --> 00:26:42.034
it is used to describe a people
who have been stripped of

00:26:42.034 --> 00:26:45.259
dignity and identity.
 

00:26:45.259 --> 00:26:50.484
If he's a city poet,
he's not a poet of the village

00:26:50.484 --> 00:26:54.349
or of London,
but rather of Harlem.

00:26:54.349 --> 00:27:02.794
And if God has withdrawn from
the world of Hughes's poems,

00:27:02.794 --> 00:27:09.461
God has left people not to
Eliotic despair and

00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:18.680
epistemological anxiety,
but rather to rape and murder.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:23.100
You might remember the last
presidential election.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.539
Do you remember that?
 

00:27:25.539 --> 00:27:30.850
John Kerry, always in search of
a theme, which he never quite

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:34.922
found, seized for a little while
on the phrase,

00:27:34.922 --> 00:27:38.020
"Let America be America again."
 

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:42.354
Sounds good.
It's the title of a poem by

00:27:42.354 --> 00:27:49.452
Langston Hughes which Kerry also
made note of when he referred to

00:27:49.452 --> 00:27:53.539
that,
when he quoted Hughes,

00:27:53.539 --> 00:28:00.810
which was resonant,
which sounded good in all sorts

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:04.527
of ways,
and which had the added

00:28:04.527 --> 00:28:09.039
advantage of letting Kerry quote
a black writer.

00:28:09.039 --> 00:28:14.368
But then, if you remember this,
you will also remember that

00:28:14.368 --> 00:28:19.971
pundits quickly pointed out that
this was not a poem nostalgic

00:28:19.971 --> 00:28:25.483
for a golden era of democracy
but rather a protest poem about

00:28:25.483 --> 00:28:29.250
the inequities of American
history,

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:34.676
and it was written by a leftist
who had ties to the Communist

00:28:34.676 --> 00:28:39.099
Party.
Whoops.

00:28:39.099 --> 00:28:43.828
This is Langston Hughes,
and it's a Russian script on

00:28:43.828 --> 00:28:47.920
the left, and there's Hughes in
the middle,

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:54.069
surrounded by a variety of
comrades in Russia in the '30s.

00:28:54.069 --> 00:28:59.950
And alas, this is not what John
Kerry wanted to project.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:06.016
Or here is Hughes with two
Soviet soldiers,

00:29:06.016 --> 00:29:09.049
also from the '30s.
 

00:29:09.049 --> 00:29:14.164
Hughes is much photographed in
many different roles and public

00:29:14.164 --> 00:29:18.859
scenes, and there's a vast
archive of those papers at the

00:29:18.859 --> 00:29:23.890
Beinecke,
from which these images come.

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:29.158
Although Hughes's reputation is
a little bit like Frost's in

00:29:29.158 --> 00:29:34.606
having this general readership
– he's poet you probably read

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:39.964
even in elementary school – he
poses all sorts of political

00:29:39.964 --> 00:29:43.089
problems that Frost does not.
 

00:29:43.089 --> 00:29:47.384
Well, here is Hughes with
somebody else,

00:29:47.384 --> 00:29:52.559
someone more acceptable to be
photographed with:

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:56.302
W.C.
Handy, in some ways the father

00:29:56.302 --> 00:29:59.385
of the blues,
as he's called,

00:29:59.385 --> 00:30:03.680
and a close friend of Hughes's.
 

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:08.740
Let me talk about Hughes and
the blues.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:12.573
Here's an image,
an illustration of Hughes's

00:30:12.573 --> 00:30:17.120
poem "Too Blue" by the
African-American artist Jacob

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.280
Lawrence.
 

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:23.400
 
 

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:28.746
Hughes, from The Weary
Blues forward,

00:30:28.746 --> 00:30:36.579
frequently presents his poems
as forms of music as allied to,

00:30:36.579 --> 00:30:41.013
as identified with,
as perhaps metaphorical

00:30:41.013 --> 00:30:44.920
versions of African-American
forms,

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.232
particularly,
but not only,

00:30:47.232 --> 00:30:50.227
the blues.
Later in his career,

00:30:50.227 --> 00:30:55.430
his readings would sometimes be
accompanied by music.

00:30:55.430 --> 00:31:03.836
In his best blues poems,
Hughes is not trying to write

00:31:03.836 --> 00:31:09.069
words for music,
I don't think,

00:31:09.069 --> 00:31:17.309
but rather is trying to write
poems that allude to and let us

00:31:17.309 --> 00:31:25.275
hear in metaphorical ways the
musical traditions which they

00:31:25.275 --> 00:31:30.523
are drawn on,
and the culture and experience

00:31:30.523 --> 00:31:32.660
from which they come.
 

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:38.146
Hughes at his most powerful
uses musical forms,

00:31:38.146 --> 00:31:44.347
popular musical forms,
for effects of compression and

00:31:44.347 --> 00:31:48.880
to develop really complex
ironies,

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:55.443
often through repetition,
usually built out of the

00:31:55.443 --> 00:32:00.400
three-part structures of the
blues.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:09.910
Let's look at the poem "Song
for a Dark Girl" on page 691.

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:17.180
 
 

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:26.154
Like many of Hughes's poems,
it's a simple poem in its

00:32:26.154 --> 00:32:35.129
structure, and yet that
simplicity conveys real verbal

00:32:35.129 --> 00:32:40.995
complexity.
And the poem in its popular

00:32:40.995 --> 00:32:48.877
mode nevertheless invites a kind
of close reading that's demanded

00:32:48.877 --> 00:32:54.923
by modernist poetry,
which presents itself as

00:32:54.923 --> 00:33:00.950
compressed, imagistic,
difficult, and so on.

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:05.810
Let's look at it.
 

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:11.810
Way Down South in Dixie
(Break the heart of me)

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:18.300
They hung my black young lover
To a cross roads tree.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:24.680
Way Down South in Dixie
(Bruised body high in air)

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:33.580
I asked the white Lord Jesus
What was the use of prayer.

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:39.870
Way Down South in Dixie
(Break the heart of me)

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:46.352
Love is a naked shadow
On a gnarled and naked

00:33:46.352 --> 00:33:52.147
tree.
This is a song for a dark girl,

00:33:52.147 --> 00:33:58.344
suggesting at once words for
her to sing – a dramatic

00:33:58.344 --> 00:34:05.574
monologue – and also "for" in
the sense of a kind of homage or

00:34:05.574 --> 00:34:12.179
tribute to her.
She is "dark."

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:19.902
As in other Hughes poems,
the word here seems to mean

00:34:19.902 --> 00:34:26.139
"black," also "darkened":
abused, grieving,

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:31.026
shadowed.
It's all held there in that

00:34:31.026 --> 00:34:35.159
simple word.
"Way Down South in Dixie" is a

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:38.050
line from the minstrel refrain.
 

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:41.530
It's borrowed here and adapted.
 

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:48.145
"Dixie" is a kind of shorthand
name for a system and history of

00:34:48.145 --> 00:34:55.152
oppression in this poem,
and the very jauntiness and

00:34:55.152 --> 00:35:03.929
pride of a colloquial name like
Dixie is played off of,

00:35:03.929 --> 00:35:09.840
here, the melancholy and grief
of the context.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:14.341
That phrase "way down," that
seems innocuous too,

00:35:14.341 --> 00:35:20.061
but isn't it resonant as it is
repeated and as we feel our way

00:35:20.061 --> 00:35:23.054
into the poem?
It's formulaic,

00:35:23.054 --> 00:35:27.922
but it suggests that we're
going, that this poem happens,

00:35:27.922 --> 00:35:34.289
somewhere deep and dark;
somewhere away, down;

00:35:34.289 --> 00:35:38.851
somewhere in the heart,
in the heart of this system of

00:35:38.851 --> 00:35:43.157
oppression;
but also, as it will turn out,

00:35:43.157 --> 00:35:48.150
in "the heart of me," as the
poem develops it.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:53.452
Here, the mere phrase,
"Way Down South in Dixie" and

00:35:53.452 --> 00:35:58.427
the mention of that name,
calling up the tune,

00:35:58.427 --> 00:36:04.822
summons a kind of a history of
oppression that would occlude

00:36:04.822 --> 00:36:11.326
the kind of story that Hughes
wants to bring forward and tell

00:36:11.326 --> 00:36:15.757
here.
The minstrel phrase is taken up

00:36:15.757 --> 00:36:22.343
by here a speaker who suffers,
who is oppressed by this system

00:36:22.343 --> 00:36:27.202
of oppression,
and she uses it to make her own

00:36:27.202 --> 00:36:31.378
music.
As in other Hughes poems,

00:36:31.378 --> 00:36:38.432
repetition – the use of the
refrain--makes everything that

00:36:38.432 --> 00:36:41.659
happens seem inevitable.
 

00:36:41.659 --> 00:36:49.406
It evokes here repeated
actions, a kind of history of

00:36:49.406 --> 00:36:55.404
repeated acts.
In general, in the case of

00:36:55.404 --> 00:37:01.800
refrains, they function in a
variety of ways.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:07.746
A refrain that comes last in a
verse unit would seem to convey

00:37:07.746 --> 00:37:12.132
the idea that,
well, somehow things always end

00:37:12.132 --> 00:37:15.379
this way.
Here, what we have is an

00:37:15.379 --> 00:37:18.760
instance of what we would call
anaphora;

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:28.469
that is, a refrain used to
initiate a unit of verse.

00:37:28.469 --> 00:37:33.165
And the refrain is the first
line of these stanzas,

00:37:33.165 --> 00:37:38.801
and it seems to suggest that
this kind of story always begins

00:37:38.801 --> 00:37:42.369
the same way,
"Way Down in Dixie."

00:37:42.369 --> 00:37:45.797
This is the way into everything
that's experienced through the

00:37:45.797 --> 00:37:47.539
poem, everything that's said.
 

00:37:47.539 --> 00:37:51.914
The parenthesis that comes
then, repeated in the second

00:37:51.914 --> 00:37:56.531
line of each of these stanzas,
functions in an interesting

00:37:56.531 --> 00:37:58.224
way.
It suggests,

00:37:58.224 --> 00:38:03.273
I think, that what is being
said in them is a kind of aside

00:38:03.273 --> 00:38:07.800
or some kind of interior
reflection or soliloquy,

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:13.199
perhaps a voice that must be
kept inside.

00:38:13.199 --> 00:38:20.017
Does that first phrase,
"Break the heart of me," refer

00:38:20.017 --> 00:38:26.321
to the girl, to her lynched
lover, or to the poet,

00:38:26.321 --> 00:38:29.280
reflecting on both?
 

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:35.295
Probably the answer is all
three, held together in a system

00:38:35.295 --> 00:38:37.369
of identification.
 

00:38:37.369 --> 00:38:41.349
That phrase,
"the heart of me," is resonant.

00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:46.314
It is what holds these three
together, a kind of shared

00:38:46.314 --> 00:38:49.314
heart.
It refers to the "heart,"

00:38:49.314 --> 00:38:53.119
meaning emotion,
feeling, probably pride.

00:38:53.119 --> 00:38:57.199
But the phrase also suggests
simply the center:

00:38:57.199 --> 00:39:01.280
the heart of me,
myself, my identity.

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:07.436
"They," "They hung my black
young lover / to a cross roads

00:39:07.436 --> 00:39:12.104
tree";
"they" is superbly vague,

00:39:12.104 --> 00:39:18.800
impersonal, plural,
formulaic, dehumanized;

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:26.179
evoking a mob,
a generalized body.

00:39:26.179 --> 00:39:29.889
Then there's that phrase,
"a cross roads tree."

00:39:29.889 --> 00:39:32.429
There are a lot of suggestions
in it.

00:39:32.429 --> 00:39:36.076
First of all,
it evokes the tree of the

00:39:36.076 --> 00:39:38.380
cross, Christ's cross.
 

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:42.168
Then the cross is also a figure
for, I think,

00:39:42.168 --> 00:39:47.161
the intersection of white and
black, as it is in the little

00:39:47.161 --> 00:39:50.950
poem called "Cross," on the page
before;

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:53.389
you could consult that.
 

00:39:53.389 --> 00:40:01.095
And then, the crossroads is one
of the central recurrent scenes

00:40:01.095 --> 00:40:05.419
of the blues.
It's where Robert Johnson,

00:40:05.419 --> 00:40:09.487
the bluesman,
was said to have made his pact

00:40:09.487 --> 00:40:14.130
with the devil.
It is the place where choices

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:20.719
are made, where crisis occurs in
a wandering and displaced life.

00:40:20.719 --> 00:40:24.193
That second verse,
"Way Down South in Dixie /

00:40:24.193 --> 00:40:28.613
bruised body high in air / I
asked the white Lord Jesus /

00:40:28.613 --> 00:40:33.744
what was the use of prayer";
now the parenthesis holds in it

00:40:33.744 --> 00:40:38.197
a kind of brutal image,
something horrifying that must

00:40:38.197 --> 00:40:40.130
be set off slightly.
 

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:44.336
The body is bruised,
it shows the marks of beating,

00:40:44.336 --> 00:40:47.449
of suffering,
in advance of murder.

00:40:47.449 --> 00:40:52.869
It's lifted high in air,
not in honor or tribute.

00:40:52.869 --> 00:40:58.824
Rather, to be lifted in this
way is to lose all agency,

00:40:58.824 --> 00:41:03.680
to be made lifeless;
all of this presented as a kind

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:08.149
of syntactic fragment in the
poem, not yet integrated into

00:41:08.149 --> 00:41:10.115
the poem,
so to speak,

00:41:10.115 --> 00:41:14.559
or it may not yet be integrated
into consciousness.

00:41:14.559 --> 00:41:20.019
The final verse--we'll go back
to it and interpret that image.

00:41:20.019 --> 00:41:24.225
Here Jesus is white:
in a sense a pure,

00:41:24.225 --> 00:41:28.757
untouched, redeemed;
but also because he is,

00:41:28.757 --> 00:41:32.677
it seems, a representative of
white culture,

00:41:32.677 --> 00:41:37.510
a kind of mediator the girl
would seek to address.

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:42.944
The girl doesn't pray to him
but rather asks a question,

00:41:42.944 --> 00:41:48.082
a question about the use of
prayer, and Jesus notably

00:41:48.082 --> 00:41:52.595
doesn't answer.
In addition to repetition,

00:41:52.595 --> 00:41:58.574
song-form poems like this are
made out of omission and jumps

00:41:58.574 --> 00:42:04.250
from one stanza to another,
from one line to another.

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:10.710
And one thing omitted here is
any sense of Jesus' reply.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:15.668
Or perhaps the answer comes in
the form of that final verse,

00:42:15.668 --> 00:42:20.374
which repeats the first lines
of the poem – this is the

00:42:20.374 --> 00:42:25.501
truth that it arises from and
returns to – and it gives us a

00:42:25.501 --> 00:42:29.892
memorable image.
The lover has become

00:42:29.892 --> 00:42:35.739
depersonalized and abstract,
merely a shadow.

00:42:35.739 --> 00:42:40.777
He has now, though,
with his abstraction become

00:42:40.777 --> 00:42:46.690
love itself: the girl's love,
perhaps Christ's love.

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:52.880
And "Love is a naked shadow /
on a gnarled and naked tree."

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:58.289
Here the repetition of "naked"
is suggestive.

00:42:58.289 --> 00:43:04.269
It evokes the man's nakedness,
his helplessness and exposure.

00:43:04.269 --> 00:43:10.005
There's also a sense of
revelation, of coming to the

00:43:10.005 --> 00:43:14.029
naked truth.
And this is something very

00:43:14.029 --> 00:43:19.211
different from the nakedness
that Yeats boasts of in his

00:43:19.211 --> 00:43:20.060
poems.
 

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:25.369
 
 

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:33.299
The blues is also about
laughter, and it is laughter

00:43:33.299 --> 00:43:40.140
that, I guess,
I would like to end with while

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:51.201
we have a few moments left,
laughter that comes out of the

00:43:51.201 --> 00:43:58.900
endurance of hardship and
suffering.

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:03.139
This is a young Hughes laughing
and here's a later one.

00:44:03.139 --> 00:44:09.765
And why don't we end with a
later poem, and that's called

00:44:09.765 --> 00:44:16.391
"Life is Fine," on page 699,
twenty years after the poems

00:44:16.391 --> 00:44:19.349
I've been discussing.
 

00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:29.079
It, too, has a song form and a
blues singer speaking to us:

00:44:29.079 --> 00:44:34.944
I went down to the river
[and think of how many rivers

00:44:34.944 --> 00:44:38.360
appear in these poems]
I set down on the bank.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:42.450
I tried to think but couldn't,
So I jumped in and sank.

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:44.660
I came up once and hollered!
 

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.389
I came up twice and cried!
 

00:44:47.389 --> 00:44:49.860
If that water hadn't a-been so
cold

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:52.380
I might've sunk and died.
 

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:54.730
But it was
Cold in that water!

00:44:54.730 --> 00:45:00.821
It was cold!
Suicide is contemplated and

00:45:00.821 --> 00:45:05.465
tried, not quite,
because when the singer gets on

00:45:05.465 --> 00:45:11.849
top of the building he decides,
"But it was / high up there!

00:45:11.849 --> 00:45:17.030
/ It was high!" and he's
not about to jump.

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:18.970
Since I'm still here
living,

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:22.130
I guess I will live on.
 

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:27.469
I could've died for love--
But for livin' I was born.

00:45:27.469 --> 00:45:30.910
[Not for love,
because that would mean dying.]

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:34.360
You may hear me holler,
You may see me cry--

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:38.470
But I'll be dogged, sweet baby,
If you gonna see me die.

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:41.920
Life is fine!
 Fine as wine!

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:47.623
Life is fine!
Well, I think rather than say

00:45:47.623 --> 00:45:51.530
anything else,
I'll stop right on time and

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:54.769
promise to return on Wednesday.
 

00:45:54.769 --> 00:45:58.000
We'll talk about William Carlos
Williams.

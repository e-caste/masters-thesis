00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.120
Prof: This topic today
is really fun.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.190
I love the Acts of Paul and
Thecla.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.320
It is such a bizarre document.
 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.192
I hope you read it before class
as the syllabus instructed you

00:00:16.192 --> 00:00:16.510
to.
 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.574
It's not an easy document to
get into if it's the first time

00:00:19.574 --> 00:00:22.690
you've come across this kind of
non-canonical early Christian

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.470
literature.
 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.659
Sometimes we'll call this stuff
"apocryphal"

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.890
which is just the Greek word
for "hidden."

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.357
This is not part of the
apocrypha that's published in

00:00:33.357 --> 00:00:37.145
your Bible,
your study Bible if you bought

00:00:37.145 --> 00:00:42.006
the Bible that I requested which
was the Oxford Study Bible with

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:43.010
Apocrypha.
 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.623
That apocrypha,
as I explained at the beginning

00:00:46.623 --> 00:00:51.180
of the whole semester is Jewish
literature that was written

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.814
sometime in the Second Temple
period and it's not explicitly

00:00:55.814 --> 00:00:59.350
Christian literature for the
most part.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.789
When people talk about The
Apocrypha that's published in a

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.141
modern Bible,
they're talking about that

00:01:05.141 --> 00:01:08.280
Jewish literature that survived
in Greek mainly.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.712
In fact this is why those books
were rejected by the reformers

00:01:12.712 --> 00:01:15.909
Martin Luther and Calvin,
and Melanchthon.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.906
They tended to not use the
apocrypha in a Protestant Bible

00:01:18.906 --> 00:01:22.269
precisely because they wanted to
go back to the Hebrew Bible like

00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:24.846
the rabbis were using,
and so The Apocrypha,

00:01:24.846 --> 00:01:27.988
although it has continued to be
part of the Roman Catholic

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:29.959
Bible,
and as something having a

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:32.268
secondary status,
has not been part of the

00:01:32.268 --> 00:01:33.190
Protestant Bible.
 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.885
That term "apocrypha"
refers to that very varying

00:01:36.885 --> 00:01:40.516
list because what is actually
even included in that Jewish

00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:44.275
apocrypha varies according to
which publication you may pick

00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:44.849
up.
 

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:48.575
Sometimes people will also use
this word "apocrypha"

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:52.178
for what they call something
like New Testament apocrypha or

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:54.010
early Christian apocrypha.
 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.025
That's kind of a misleading
term because there's nothing

00:01:57.025 --> 00:01:59.110
hidden about this literature at
all.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.305
It's always been there,
it's just not part of the

00:02:01.305 --> 00:02:02.129
Christian canon.
 

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:06.433
Some of it is entirely
orthodox, some of it is rather

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:10.014
heretical,
and some of it is somewhere not

00:02:10.014 --> 00:02:14.461
completely in tune with later
orthodoxy but nevertheless

00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:19.150
reflecting what was definitely
orthodox in its own day.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.000
All this literature is written
in the second century,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.926
our document today,
the Acts of Paul and

00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:26.181
Thecla,
was composed in the second

00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:29.778
century and it was considered
quite good literature by many

00:02:29.778 --> 00:02:31.020
early Christians.
 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.901
It just wasn't part of the New
Testament, mainly because people

00:02:34.901 --> 00:02:38.658
knew it was a bit later of a
document, not so much because of

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:40.348
concerns for orthodoxy.
 

00:02:40.348 --> 00:02:43.960
One of the purposes of my
teaching this course,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.169
one of my purposes of teaching
all of my courses,

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:53.280
is to get students to start
thinking completely differently.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.794
In other words,
you've noticed,

00:02:54.794 --> 00:02:57.503
perhaps,
that one of the things I stress

00:02:57.503 --> 00:03:00.908
in my lectures is how odd the
ancient world is,

00:03:00.908 --> 00:03:04.653
even how odd early Christianity
is from what most of us tend to

00:03:04.653 --> 00:03:05.438
come at it.
 

00:03:05.438 --> 00:03:08.425
This is because I teach New
Testament studies and the

00:03:08.425 --> 00:03:11.639
history of early Christianity
almost like ethnography.

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.574
I try to get you to imagine
yourself coming into a culture

00:03:14.574 --> 00:03:17.560
that's really different from the
culture you grew up in.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.955
This is something I think is
basic to religious studies as a

00:03:21.955 --> 00:03:25.443
discipline,
and religious studies teaches

00:03:25.443 --> 00:03:29.318
you to look at some kind of
group of people,

00:03:29.318 --> 00:03:32.455
or an activity,
or a belief structure that

00:03:32.455 --> 00:03:35.818
seems to you initially
absolutely bizarre.

00:03:35.818 --> 00:03:39.032
And you think,
how could any rational person

00:03:39.032 --> 00:03:39.780
do that?
 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.030
How can any rational person
belief that?

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.702
To keep looking at it seriously
and to look at it with enough

00:03:46.702 --> 00:03:50.907
sympathy that you actually can
see eventually how it is

00:03:50.907 --> 00:03:52.699
perfectly rational.
 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:56.378
This document today is a great
place to illustrate that,

00:03:56.378 --> 00:03:59.229
because whenever I teach this
document to people your age,

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:01.810
eighteen to twenty-two year old
college students,

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.520
if you read this carefully and
you get into this stuff,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.560
it should be bizarre to you.
 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.536
This document depicts young
people who are attracted to a

00:04:11.536 --> 00:04:16.779
version of Christianity that
forbids having sex entirely.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.740
It's completely ascetic.
 

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.101
The Paul in the Acts of Paul
and Thecla says,

00:04:22.101 --> 00:04:24.879
if you have sex you're probably
not going to go to heaven.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:29.271
Basically the gospel mentioned
in this document is continence,

00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:32.439
by which this document means
avoiding sex.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:36.790
And that's going to be bizarre
enough because people in the

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.639
modern world kind of have the
idea,

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.154
well why would somebody join
any movement that forbade sexual

00:04:44.154 --> 00:04:45.660
intimacy entirely?
 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.190
What kind of draw did that have
for people?

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.379
Why did that gospel succeed?
 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:53.449
What may be surprising to you
is it did succeed.

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.620
In the ancient world a lot of
people,

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.240
especially it seems sometimes
even young people,

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.271
were drawn to early
Christianity precisely because

00:05:02.271 --> 00:05:03.670
it was ascetic.
 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.415
It taught this radical
asceticism of watching what you

00:05:07.415 --> 00:05:11.281
eat and especially avoiding sex,
or if not avoiding sex

00:05:11.281 --> 00:05:14.824
entirely, severely limiting
sexual intercourse and sexual

00:05:14.824 --> 00:05:15.709
attraction.
 

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:18.750
\What is it about the ancient
culture,

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.379
what is it about these people
that caused them not only to be

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.009
converted to Christianity but to
be converted especially to a

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.550
form of it that was radically
ascetic?

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.829
In order to see why that kind
of Christianity was--because

00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:35.110
that's the actual kind of
Christianity that was successful

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.550
in the ancient world.
 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.100
If you were listening to most
modern American Christians,

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.617
modern American people
generally, what are the two most

00:05:43.617 --> 00:05:47.071
important teachings about
Christianity in the minds of

00:05:47.071 --> 00:05:48.310
most Americans?
 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.310
The family, the importance of
the family,

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.670
and by that they mean the
heterosexual nuclear family,

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.819
but even the liberal churches
which are willing to recognize

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:02.190
gay relationships,
they still construe that as gay

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.040
marriage or just gay versions of
the nuclear family.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.245
The family is the most
important thing about

00:06:08.245 --> 00:06:10.810
Christianity in the minds of a
lot of Americans.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.620
The second thing is
nationalism, patriotism.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.271
If you took away patriotism and
nationalism, and the family out

00:06:18.271 --> 00:06:21.648
of Christianity,
most people in modern America

00:06:21.648 --> 00:06:24.199
wouldn't recognize it as such.
 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:27.132
What's odd is that,
when you read these ancient

00:06:27.132 --> 00:06:30.894
documents, that's precisely the
two things that Christianity

00:06:30.894 --> 00:06:31.660
attacks.
 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.464
This form of early Christianity
was anti-family,

00:06:35.464 --> 00:06:39.269
for the most part,
and it was anti-patriotic.

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:44.004
The people who say,
but this is traditional

00:06:44.004 --> 00:06:47.339
Christianity,
those people don't know their

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:50.168
history before 1950,
because the church,

00:06:50.168 --> 00:06:55.350
the overall Christian churches
were never pro-family for the

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.600
first 1500 years of its
existence.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.810
The Roman Catholic Church,
up until the Reformation,

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.120
always had as its official
position,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.901
not just popular ideas,
its official position was

00:07:07.901 --> 00:07:10.740
celibacy is superior to
sexuality.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.160
If you have to have sex,
if you can't control yourself

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.966
you're allowed to get married
and have sex within the bounds

00:07:17.966 --> 00:07:19.000
of marriage.
 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.216
But the better thing,
the better virtue would be to

00:07:22.216 --> 00:07:24.920
avoid sex entirely for your
entire life.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.920
The next best thing is to have
sex if you need just to make

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.663
babies,
but then as soon as you have

00:07:30.663 --> 00:07:33.516
your babies,
stop having sex and be ascetic

00:07:33.516 --> 00:07:35.300
the rest of your life.
 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.911
If your spouse dies,
you are permitted to get

00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:40.797
remarried,
most of the time,

00:07:40.797 --> 00:07:43.490
but the higher virtue would be
in remaining unmarried and

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.800
remaining celibate for the rest
of your life.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.225
That was considered the
doctrine in Christianity,

00:07:49.225 --> 00:07:52.793
at least up until the
Reformation, so the sixteenth

00:07:52.793 --> 00:07:53.649
century.
 

00:07:53.649 --> 00:07:55.982
When people talk about
"traditional family

00:07:55.982 --> 00:07:58.720
values" being traditionally
the Christian way,

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.309
they're not talking about
Christianity as it existed from

00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:05.769
the time of Jesus all the way up
until around 1600,

00:08:05.769 --> 00:08:09.980
and even then from 1600 until
1950,

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.184
the ideal form in most
Christianity was not the nuclear

00:08:13.184 --> 00:08:15.319
family but some kind of
household.

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:18.185
In Puritan New England,
people didn't live in little

00:08:18.185 --> 00:08:21.286
nuclear families--
townships, the New Haven

00:08:21.286 --> 00:08:24.500
Colony, the Massachusetts Bay
Colony,

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.105
they were organized into
households that were run by the

00:08:28.105 --> 00:08:31.379
male head of household,
his wife under him,

00:08:31.379 --> 00:08:35.043
children under that,
servants and other free people

00:08:35.043 --> 00:08:38.301
often living in the household
also or connected to the

00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:39.100
household.
 

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.658
If you are, for example,
an adult male,

00:08:41.658 --> 00:08:44.590
twenty-five years old in New
England,

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.820
in Puritan New England,
and you weren't married,

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.408
you weren't really supposed to
live alone or with other men.

00:08:51.408 --> 00:08:54.629
That happens sometimes,
but the town fathers--

00:08:54.629 --> 00:08:58.538
and these colonies were ruled
as communities,

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:02.057
not individual people--the town
fathers would want to put you

00:09:02.057 --> 00:09:05.363
into somebody else's household,
into the household of another

00:09:05.363 --> 00:09:05.590
man.
 

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.120
They certainly wouldn't let
women, adult women live

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.038
separately.
 

00:09:10.038 --> 00:09:12.649
Notice, this is not
individualism in the modern

00:09:12.649 --> 00:09:15.942
sense, and it's not the nuclear
family in the modern sense,

00:09:15.942 --> 00:09:18.269
these are extended family
households.

00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:21.528
That was the New England
Protestant way.

00:09:21.528 --> 00:09:26.344
When did the idea that the best
form of the family was the

00:09:26.344 --> 00:09:30.990
nuclear family come about in
popular culture overall?

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:32.668
The 1950s.
 

00:09:32.668 --> 00:09:36.839
When people talk about that
being the Christian thing

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:41.409
they're forgetting the vast
sweep of Christian history.

00:09:41.409 --> 00:09:43.269
They're just ignoring it.
 

00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:47.270
This document is a good place
to see why that made sense for

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.317
people,
especially in the ancient

00:09:49.317 --> 00:09:51.719
world, and to make it--
since for the Middle Ages and

00:09:51.719 --> 00:09:54.009
all the rest of the time you'll
have to take another course.

00:09:54.009 --> 00:09:57.788
One of the things I want you to
do is enter into this text as if

00:09:57.788 --> 00:10:01.129
you're an ethnographer,
an anthropologist and try to

00:10:01.129 --> 00:10:04.750
see how does this make sense,
how does this gospel that this

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.429
text proclaimed,
how did it make sense to people

00:10:07.429 --> 00:10:09.340
and why was it so wildly
popular,

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.990
because it was wildly popular.
 

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.269
First, you have to know a bit
about the Greco-Roman novel.

00:10:16.269 --> 00:10:18.432
I talked about this early in
the semester when we talked

00:10:18.432 --> 00:10:19.730
about the Acts of the Apostles.
 

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:23.096
Greek novels are very
interesting, there are six of

00:10:23.096 --> 00:10:25.590
them that survive in almost
whole,

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.440
and in fragments of a lot of
others,

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.120
and you can find these in the
English translation.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.678
Help me out teaching fellows,
what's the name of the

00:10:34.678 --> 00:10:37.629
collection of the Greek novels?
 

00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:40.436
It's called something like
Collected Greek Novels,

00:10:40.436 --> 00:10:40.779
yes.
 

00:10:40.779 --> 00:10:44.850
Reardon is the editor:
R-E-A-R-D-O-N.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.413
If you want to dip into these
just get the collected ancient

00:10:48.413 --> 00:10:51.980
novels - edited by Reardon and
read through some of them.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.720
They're very entertaining.
 

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.070
One of the things that the
typical plot is,

00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.058
a woman of high elite status,
these are--

00:11:00.058 --> 00:11:03.048
these usually are people--young
people of elite families--

00:11:03.048 --> 00:11:05.750
they're usually set in
classical Greece although

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.450
they're not written until the
first century,

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.389
second century,
third century of our era,

00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:13.340
but they're often set in a more
classical Greek setting.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.687
They are upper class people:
a young woman who's of an upper

00:11:16.687 --> 00:11:20.148
class family falls in love with
a young man who's also from an

00:11:20.148 --> 00:11:22.884
upper class family,
and in a few of the Greek

00:11:22.884 --> 00:11:26.350
novels they actually get married
and have a little honeymoon,

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.710
a brief honeymoon period,
and then all hell breaks loose

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:29.740
and something happens.
 

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.743
In some cases they don't even
get to consummate their love yet

00:11:32.743 --> 00:11:34.269
because something intervenes.
 

00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:36.990
Usually what happens is a
disaster strikes.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.990
In one--I think I mentioned
this to you,

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.019
by Chariton,
Chaereas and Callirhoe,

00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:47.629
in one the husband gets jealous
thinking that his wife has had

00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:50.503
an affair he--
in a fit of rage--he kicks her,

00:11:50.503 --> 00:11:53.080
she falls over and everybody
thinks she's dead.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.491
So he's grieving and grieving
because of course he's still

00:11:55.491 --> 00:11:56.548
madly in love with her.
 

00:11:56.548 --> 00:11:58.190
They're both madly in love with
each other.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:01.707
But they bury her in the tomb,
the big family tomb that's on

00:12:01.707 --> 00:12:03.200
the shore by the water.
 

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.681
Of course like--and Shakespeare
stole mercilessly from these

00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:07.826
kinds of things--
she wakes up in the tomb after

00:12:07.826 --> 00:12:10.340
they've already sealed the tomb
and she can't get out,

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.570
and she says,
woe is me, they've buried me,

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:15.788
I will never see my loved one.
 

00:12:15.788 --> 00:12:19.775
Pirates, who happened to be
outside, there were always

00:12:19.775 --> 00:12:23.009
pirates in these things,
lots of pirates.

00:12:23.009 --> 00:12:25.942
Pirates happened to be outside,
they hear her crying,

00:12:25.942 --> 00:12:27.690
and they break into the tomb.
 

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.090
They were just going to do a
little tomb robbery,

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.100
they were just attempting a
tomb robbery,

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.196
but they find this living
maiden--not maiden anymore she's

00:12:35.196 --> 00:12:38.149
had sex now so she's a maid,
not a maiden anymore.

00:12:38.149 --> 00:12:40.229
Anyway a beautiful young woman
and they decide,

00:12:40.229 --> 00:12:42.897
well great this--we can get
more for her than from the stuff

00:12:42.897 --> 00:12:43.440
in here.
 

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.860
We'll kidnap her,
sell her as into slavery at

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.259
some other port.
 

00:12:48.259 --> 00:12:49.658
And they do.
 

00:12:49.658 --> 00:12:52.605
So they take her off,
they take her around over to

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:54.529
Asia Minor, modern day Turkey.
 

00:12:54.529 --> 00:12:57.110
And there they sell her to this
wealthy man.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:00.120
He falls in love with her,
so he decides to marry her.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.692
And then something else happens
and they go to the King of

00:13:02.692 --> 00:13:05.220
Persia, and the King of Persia
falls in love with her.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.200
So he steals her away from the
Greek guy.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.798
And then wars break out.
 

00:13:09.798 --> 00:13:12.715
And her husband as soon as he
finds that she's been stolen

00:13:12.715 --> 00:13:15.836
away, he starts traveling all
around the Mediterranean looking

00:13:15.836 --> 00:13:16.450
for her.
 

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:19.518
And he'll get just to
Alexandria in Egypt the day

00:13:19.518 --> 00:13:22.970
after she's been sold off to
slavery someplace else.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.092
These two traipse around the
Mediterranean looking for

00:13:25.092 --> 00:13:27.618
their--because they're madly in
love and they want to consummate

00:13:27.618 --> 00:13:28.379
their marriage.
 

00:13:28.379 --> 00:13:30.950
And of course everybody falls
in love with both of them.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.961
No matter where this young
woman goes every man around

00:13:33.961 --> 00:13:36.860
falls in love with her,
and that causes problems all

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:37.940
over the place.
 

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.508
Of course in the ancient world
everywhere the young man goes

00:13:40.508 --> 00:13:42.379
everybody falls in love with
him,

00:13:42.379 --> 00:13:44.658
both women and men,
because that was quite common.

00:13:44.658 --> 00:13:47.450
And so they both have all this
eroticism.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:50.308
They're describing their beauty
all the time.

00:13:50.308 --> 00:13:52.952
Usually there's someplace in
the novel where they can get

00:13:52.952 --> 00:13:53.330
naked.
 

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.691
Where somehow the plot happens
where she's stripped because

00:13:56.691 --> 00:13:59.982
she's going to be punished,
or he's stripped because he's

00:13:59.982 --> 00:14:03.022
going to be crucified,
or something has happened and

00:14:03.022 --> 00:14:06.586
the story kind of concentrates
on how beautiful their bodies

00:14:06.586 --> 00:14:07.009
are.
 

00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:09.474
In other words,
the novels are about being

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:12.480
faithful to the person you loved
in your youth,

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.446
because they both try not to
have sex with anybody else if

00:14:15.446 --> 00:14:16.798
they can at all do that.
 

00:14:16.798 --> 00:14:19.250
Be faithful to your lover from
your youth.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:23.528
But the erotic drive is just
all the way through the novel.

00:14:23.528 --> 00:14:26.607
The novels are full of
eroticism and the eroticism of

00:14:26.607 --> 00:14:27.200
the eye.
 

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.471
This Acts of Paul and
Thecla is so wonderfully

00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:35.658
like those things because it
also uses eroticism.

00:14:35.658 --> 00:14:39.782
Did you notice how often Thecla
is portrayed as gorgeous and

00:14:39.782 --> 00:14:42.892
even stripped so you,
as the voyeuristic reader,

00:14:42.892 --> 00:14:46.086
can imagine her naked body
before she's thrown into the vat

00:14:46.086 --> 00:14:47.740
of killer man-eating seals.
 

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:48.879
You remember that scene.
 

00:14:48.879 --> 00:14:53.668
The erotic is here in this
text, but the erotic is used to

00:14:53.668 --> 00:14:55.600
the opposite purpose.
 

00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.509
The erotic is used to actually
teach you to avoid sex.

00:15:00.509 --> 00:15:04.328
To really read this text of the
Acts of Paul and Thecla

00:15:04.328 --> 00:15:08.086
it helps if you know the way
these ancient Greek novels often

00:15:08.086 --> 00:15:08.649
work.
 

00:15:08.649 --> 00:15:11.886
Let's look at the text now,
and I'll show you some of these

00:15:11.886 --> 00:15:12.389
things.
 

00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:13.480
Look at paragraph 18.
 

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.712
I don't know if you have the
pages, there are a couple of

00:15:16.712 --> 00:15:19.600
different editions that I've
used in this class.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.293
I don't know which I had for
downloading with you but I'm

00:15:22.293 --> 00:15:24.985
going to not talk about page
numbers most of the time but

00:15:24.985 --> 00:15:27.774
paragraph numbers because the
texts are all divided up into

00:15:27.774 --> 00:15:28.928
paragraph numbers.
 

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:45.668
In paragraph 18,
Thecla has gone off to prison.

00:15:45.668 --> 00:15:49.456
Of course the story goes that
she hears Paul preaching in her

00:15:49.456 --> 00:15:53.306
hometown, and she falls in love
with him just from hearing his

00:15:53.306 --> 00:15:54.190
preaching.
 

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.331
Now the text doesn't really say
she falls in love with

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:57.139
him, right?
 

00:15:57.139 --> 00:16:00.458
But it describes her as being
enamored of Paul,

00:16:00.458 --> 00:16:04.355
at least of his gospel,
and so she goes to visit him in

00:16:04.355 --> 00:16:05.149
prison.
 

00:16:05.149 --> 00:16:07.629
He's been thrown in prison
because wherever Paul goes he

00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:09.658
gets into trouble with the men
of the city.

00:16:09.658 --> 00:16:11.636
And it's always the men of the
city he gets in trough with,

00:16:11.636 --> 00:16:11.908
right?
 

00:16:11.908 --> 00:16:15.509
It's because he's teaching
wives not to have sex with their

00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:16.690
husbands anymore.
 

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:19.158
Well, this gets the guys upset.
 

00:16:19.158 --> 00:16:22.671
He's teaching unmarried women
not to get married and young men

00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:23.879
not to get married.
 

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:26.200
Well, if you don't get married
and you don't have sex,

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.711
you're not going to have
children, you're not going to

00:16:27.711 --> 00:16:29.566
have babies,
and the households will all

00:16:29.566 --> 00:16:30.200
fall apart.
 

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.765
So Paul gets in trouble
precisely because of his

00:16:32.765 --> 00:16:35.115
anti-household,
anti-sex message because the

00:16:35.115 --> 00:16:38.044
men of the city know full well
that if you don't have sex and

00:16:38.044 --> 00:16:40.399
you don't have households,
you're not going to have a city.

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:44.509
Civilization is going to fall
apart, in their view.

00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:47.114
He's arrested,
she goes to visit him in

00:16:47.114 --> 00:16:48.889
prison,
and then it says,

00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:52.091
"To the jailer she gave a
silver mirror,"

00:16:52.091 --> 00:16:55.488
a mirror is in the ancient
world is a typical sign for

00:16:55.488 --> 00:16:57.090
femininity in women.
 

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:00.991
On tombstones you'll often see
a mirror carved when it's a

00:17:00.991 --> 00:17:04.210
girl, a young girl who's buried
at that tomb.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.450
So she gives the jailer her
silver mirror.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.125
She went into Paul and sat at
his feet and heard him proclaim

00:17:09.125 --> 00:17:10.240
the mighty acts of God.
 

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.978
Paul feared nothing but
comported himself with full

00:17:13.978 --> 00:17:16.969
confidence in God,
and her faith was also

00:17:16.969 --> 00:17:19.960
increased as she kissed his
fetters.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.929
Next paragraph down 20:
"He commanded Paul to be

00:17:22.929 --> 00:17:24.700
brought to the judgment seat.
 

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.249
But Thecla rolled herself on
the place where Paul taught as

00:17:28.249 --> 00:17:29.778
he sat in prison."
 

00:17:29.778 --> 00:17:36.650
She's rolling around in the
dust where Paul had sat earlier.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:40.621
Did you ever hear old people
talk about how in very strict

00:17:40.621 --> 00:17:43.130
Roman Catholic schools and
stuff,

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:46.279
guys were not supposed to sit
in the same folding chair that a

00:17:46.279 --> 00:17:48.808
girl had just sat in because it
would be warm,

00:17:48.808 --> 00:17:53.390
and that was considered a
little too erotic?

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.240
Yep.
 

00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:00.390
People were screwed up.
 

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:05.965
"She stood there looking
steadily at Paul,"

00:18:05.965 --> 00:18:09.825
and a little further,
"Thecla sought for Paul as

00:18:09.825 --> 00:18:12.190
a lamb in the wilderness looks
about for shepherd."

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:22.353
In paragraph 22:
The young men and the maidens

00:18:22.353 --> 00:18:24.808
brought wood and straw that
Thecla might be burned,

00:18:24.808 --> 00:18:29.199
and as she was brought in naked
the governor wept and marveled

00:18:29.199 --> 00:18:31.430
at the power that was in her.
 

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.900
I'm not too sure about the
writing here.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.380
Notice how over and over again
in this text there's something

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.766
about kissing or marveling,
or looking, and right at the

00:18:40.766 --> 00:18:44.118
point where you think that the
body should be what's being

00:18:44.118 --> 00:18:47.375
referred to,
the author says something like

00:18:47.375 --> 00:18:50.618
"power"
or "message."

00:18:50.618 --> 00:18:55.111
There's a direction toward the
body all the way through this

00:18:55.111 --> 00:18:57.890
text,
and then a diversion of your

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:02.230
attention as a reader away from
the body to the gospel.

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:06.558
But the body is still there
just hovering right around the

00:19:06.558 --> 00:19:08.230
edge of your vision.
 

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.338
So the text does that over and
over again.

00:19:10.338 --> 00:19:23.308
Look at paragraph 25--well over
and over again--

00:19:23.308 --> 00:19:25.767
I'm not going to go through
anymore examples of that because

00:19:25.767 --> 00:19:27.598
they're just all the way through
the text.

00:19:27.598 --> 00:19:31.070
Sex is the driving force of
this piece of literature even

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.914
though the piece of literature
is going to try to teach you not

00:19:34.914 --> 00:19:37.657
to have sex,
and so there's also desire and

00:19:37.657 --> 00:19:39.288
passion all the way through.
 

00:19:39.288 --> 00:19:42.970
But, as I said,
the main message of the text is

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:44.328
don't have sex.
 

00:19:44.328 --> 00:19:47.680
So look at paragraph 5,
this is where Paul is giving

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.163
his own version of the
beatitudes that you're familiar

00:19:51.163 --> 00:19:53.200
with from Matthew and Luke.
 

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.684
Paul's version is very
different though,

00:19:56.684 --> 00:19:57.400
right?
 

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.289
It says in paragraph 5:
When Paul was entered into the

00:20:00.289 --> 00:20:02.006
house of Onesiphorus,
there was great joy,

00:20:02.006 --> 00:20:03.655
bowing of knees,
breaking of bread,

00:20:03.655 --> 00:20:07.200
and the word of God concerning
continence and the resurrection.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.977
Now the word
"continence"

00:20:08.977 --> 00:20:11.118
there is just referring to
asceticism,

00:20:11.118 --> 00:20:14.259
but in this text it doesn't
mean just controlling your sex

00:20:14.259 --> 00:20:16.296
life,
it means not having sex

00:20:16.296 --> 00:20:16.990
entirely.
 

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:19.031
When this author,
this translation says

00:20:19.031 --> 00:20:21.611
"continence,"
you read that as complete

00:20:21.611 --> 00:20:24.028
sexual asceticism,
so that's the message.

00:20:24.028 --> 00:20:27.265
Notice how continence is linked
to resurrection,

00:20:27.265 --> 00:20:30.568
so the avoidance of sex is
directly linked to the

00:20:30.568 --> 00:20:33.460
resurrection of the body in this
text.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.598
These are the beatitudes:
Blessed are the pure in heart

00:20:36.598 --> 00:20:37.509
for they shall see God.
 

00:20:37.509 --> 00:20:41.594
Blessed are they who have kept
the flesh pure [and don't be

00:20:41.594 --> 00:20:44.761
misled in this text that means
not having sex]

00:20:44.761 --> 00:20:47.720
for they shall become a temple
of God.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.338
Blessed are the continent for
to them God will speak.

00:20:51.338 --> 00:20:54.186
Blessed are they who have
renounced this world for they

00:20:54.186 --> 00:20:55.980
shall be well pleasing unto God.
 

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.759
Blessed are they who have wives
as if they had them not for they

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:00.960
shall inherit God.
 

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.568
Now that's actually almost a
quotation from Paul's letter.

00:21:03.568 --> 00:21:06.172
Paul talks about having,
as if you did not have,

00:21:06.172 --> 00:21:08.829
and this sort of thing,
living your life "as

00:21:08.829 --> 00:21:09.548
if."
 

00:21:09.548 --> 00:21:12.644
"Blessed are they who have
fear of God for they shall

00:21:12.644 --> 00:21:14.220
become angels of God."
 

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.982
Now it might help you to know
there that angels in the ancient

00:21:17.982 --> 00:21:21.191
world are often depicted as
androgynous, as not being

00:21:21.191 --> 00:21:21.868
sexual.
 

00:21:21.868 --> 00:21:26.009
Anybody seen the movie
"Dogma"?

00:21:26.009 --> 00:21:27.028
How many have seen the movie
"Dogma"?

00:21:27.028 --> 00:21:28.640
Raise your hand so I can see
them.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.316
If you haven't seen the movie
"Dogma"

00:21:30.316 --> 00:21:30.788
go rent it.
 

00:21:30.788 --> 00:21:34.740
It's a highly important
theological movie.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.730
It's a very theological movie
actually.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.634
If you've seen it you remember
there's a place where the angel

00:21:40.634 --> 00:21:43.300
who's appearing to the woman
who's going to be the chosen

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.182
one,
the Mary-type figure,

00:21:45.182 --> 00:21:48.777
he appears in her bedroom in
the middle of the night,

00:21:48.777 --> 00:21:49.400
right?
 

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.779
She thinks he's there to rape
her so she takes a baseball bat

00:21:51.779 --> 00:21:53.933
and she's going to try to--
and he's trying to not get

00:21:53.933 --> 00:21:56.598
pummeled with the baseball bat,
so he pulls his pants down to

00:21:56.598 --> 00:21:57.990
show her that he's an angel.
 

00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.798
Why does that work?
 

00:21:58.798 --> 00:22:01.615
Because he doesn't have
genitalia, and so that proves to

00:22:01.615 --> 00:22:04.740
her, or it's supposed to prove
to her, she's just confused.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.858
She doesn't know her angelology
properly.

00:22:08.858 --> 00:22:11.740
If she knew her angelology she
would know that angels,

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.980
at least in one dominant form
of tradition,

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.257
are androgynous,
so they don't have genitalia or

00:22:16.257 --> 00:22:19.019
they're either completely male
or something like that,

00:22:19.019 --> 00:22:21.068
so that's why Paul says in this
beatitude,

00:22:21.068 --> 00:22:23.990
"You will be as the angels
of God."

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:28.769
"Blessed are they who have
kept their baptism secure."

00:22:28.769 --> 00:22:31.772
Again one of the teachings of
early Christianity like this

00:22:31.772 --> 00:22:35.038
was, once you're baptized you're
not allowed to sin anymore.

00:22:35.038 --> 00:22:37.785
Baptism, according to some
teachings in early Christianity,

00:22:37.785 --> 00:22:40.577
would cleanse you of all the
sins you had committed up until

00:22:40.577 --> 00:22:41.950
the time you're baptized.
 

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:44.730
What if you sin after your
baptism?

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:48.148
Well, there might be other ways
to get forgiveness for that,

00:22:48.148 --> 00:22:49.538
but you're in trouble.
 

00:22:49.538 --> 00:22:52.663
This is why a lot of emperors
would not get baptized until

00:22:52.663 --> 00:22:55.346
their deathbed,
because they wanted to make

00:22:55.346 --> 00:22:59.164
sure--emperors have to sin,
they have to kill people,

00:22:59.164 --> 00:23:02.994
they have to fight wars,
so the idea was you just don't

00:23:02.994 --> 00:23:06.564
get baptized until right before
you die and then you can go to

00:23:06.564 --> 00:23:07.150
heaven.
 

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:09.848
That's what this is talking
about, keeping your baptism

00:23:09.848 --> 00:23:10.200
pure.
 

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:19.169
Below that the last blessed,
"Blessed are the bodies of

00:23:19.169 --> 00:23:21.888
the virgins for they shall be
well pleasing to God and shall

00:23:21.888 --> 00:23:24.009
not lose the reward of their
purity."

00:23:24.009 --> 00:23:27.058
Right below that in paragraph
7:

00:23:27.058 --> 00:23:30.112
Thamyris sat at a nearby window
and listened night and day to

00:23:30.112 --> 00:23:33.304
the word of the virgin life,
as it was spoken by Paul,

00:23:33.304 --> 00:23:37.048
moreover she saw many women and
virgins going into Paul,

00:23:37.048 --> 00:23:41.595
she desired to be counted
worthy herself to stand in

00:23:41.595 --> 00:23:43.200
Paul's presence.
 

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.095
Now look right at paragraph 9:
"All the women and young

00:23:48.095 --> 00:23:51.259
people go into him and are
taught by him.

00:23:51.259 --> 00:23:54.308
You must, he says,
fear one single God only and

00:23:54.308 --> 00:23:55.368
live chastely.
 

00:23:55.368 --> 00:23:57.573
And my daughter also,
like a spider at the window

00:23:57.573 --> 00:23:59.409
bound by his words,
is dominated by a new

00:23:59.409 --> 00:24:00.190
desire."
 

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:03.153
This is her mother talking
because her mother is very upset

00:24:03.153 --> 00:24:05.861
that Thecla has done this
because Thecla broke off her

00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:08.977
great engagement to the richest
guy in town in order to follow

00:24:08.977 --> 00:24:09.538
Paul.
 

00:24:09.538 --> 00:24:11.028
So the mother doesn't like
this."...

00:24:11.028 --> 00:24:14.000
dominated by a new desire and a
fearful passion."

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.967
So notice desire and passion
again are still part of the

00:24:16.967 --> 00:24:19.881
narrative, but now they're
redirected to a desire and a

00:24:19.881 --> 00:24:21.769
passion precisely for celibacy.
 

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.849
Also, the bad guys in this are
anti-ascetic.

00:24:29.849 --> 00:24:32.088
Look at paragraph 13.
 

00:24:32.088 --> 00:24:35.029
Paul and the good guys are all
ascetic.

00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:39.075
In paragraph 13,
in fact, right above that this

00:24:39.075 --> 00:24:42.733
is Demos and Hermogenes--
now a bunch of the names in

00:24:42.733 --> 00:24:45.730
this document actually come from
Pauline literature from the New

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:46.348
Testament.
 

00:24:46.348 --> 00:24:49.512
So this writer probably knows
the Pastoral Epistles and some

00:24:49.512 --> 00:24:52.892
of the other writings that make
up the New Testament because the

00:24:52.892 --> 00:24:55.519
writer is taking details out of
Paul's life,

00:24:55.519 --> 00:24:57.029
as you would see it in the New
Testament,

00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:58.440
like these names for example.
 

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.586
Demos is mentioned in the
Pastoral Epistles as someone for

00:25:01.586 --> 00:25:03.509
forsook Paul,
"being in love with the

00:25:03.509 --> 00:25:04.960
present world,"
is what it says,

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.710
so this writer is
talking--using the same name.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:10.723
Demos is a bad guy here who had
been a follower of Paul but he's

00:25:10.723 --> 00:25:11.730
now betraying Paul.
 

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.730
They say, "Who this man is
we do not know.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:17.338
But he deprives young men of
wives,

00:25:17.338 --> 00:25:20.180
maidens of husbands,
saying otherwise there is no

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:23.849
resurrection for you except you
remain chaste and do not defile

00:25:23.849 --> 00:25:26.038
the flesh but keep it
pure."

00:25:26.038 --> 00:25:29.917
They know what Paul's teaching,
this radical asceticism,

00:25:29.917 --> 00:25:32.880
and Paul links this to the
resurrection.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.525
If you're not chaste and pure,
you won't experience the

00:25:35.525 --> 00:25:36.259
resurrection.
 

00:25:36.259 --> 00:25:38.538
Thamyris said to them,
"Come into my house you

00:25:38.538 --> 00:25:39.858
men and rest with me."
 

00:25:39.858 --> 00:25:42.655
And they went off to a
sumptuous banquet with much

00:25:42.655 --> 00:25:45.108
wine, great wealth,
and a splendid table.

00:25:45.108 --> 00:25:49.662
Notice, these guys who betray
Paul are not only teaching that

00:25:49.662 --> 00:25:52.848
people should get married and
have sex,

00:25:52.848 --> 00:25:54.920
but they're also having great
wine,

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.490
they're having a lot of food,
they're doing all the

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:58.569
anti-ascetic stuff.
 

00:25:58.569 --> 00:26:00.288
They're anti-ascetic.
 

00:26:00.288 --> 00:26:02.980
The enemies of Paul,
and the gospel here,

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.233
are the anti-ascetics,
and of course that makes you

00:26:05.233 --> 00:26:07.779
think,
who does this look like that

00:26:07.779 --> 00:26:10.608
we've been reading lately who
says,

00:26:10.608 --> 00:26:13.640
"Drink a little wine for
your stomach's sake"?

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.400
It's the writer of the Pastoral
Epistles.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.670
Remember we saw that?
 

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.957
The writer of I Timothy
admonishes Timothy to drink

00:26:22.957 --> 00:26:25.848
wine, not to be an ascetic and
avoid wine.

00:26:25.848 --> 00:26:29.104
The writer of the Pastoral
Epistles teaches that it's the

00:26:29.104 --> 00:26:31.720
enemies of Paul who
forbid marriage.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.695
So the Pastoral Epistles,
if this author knows the

00:26:34.695 --> 00:26:37.430
Pastoral Epistles,
he's writing against it.

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.547
And if the Pastoral Epistles
knows the Acts of Paul and

00:26:40.547 --> 00:26:42.900
Thecla, they're written
against this.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.680
We don't know that they knew
each other exactly,

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:49.170
although it's entirely possible
that this author knew Paul's

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:49.940
writings.
 

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:54.220
So, basically,
what is the problem of life

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:57.039
according to this author?
 

00:26:57.039 --> 00:26:58.400
Sex and family.
 

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.318
What's the answer to life?
 

00:27:01.318 --> 00:27:03.923
Avoiding sex and family,
and then you experience the

00:27:03.923 --> 00:27:04.690
resurrection.
 

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:09.259
What is the deeper problem then
that this is addressing?

00:27:09.259 --> 00:27:12.250
Here the problem you can see it
in paragraph 17.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:23.058
This is Paul talking to the
proconsul:

00:27:23.058 --> 00:27:25.269
"The living God,
the God of vengeance,

00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:26.906
the jealous God,
the God who has need of

00:27:26.906 --> 00:27:29.335
nothing,
has sent me since he desires

00:27:29.335 --> 00:27:33.615
the salvation of men that I may
draw them away from corruption

00:27:33.615 --> 00:27:36.806
and impurity,
all pleasure and death,

00:27:36.806 --> 00:27:39.670
that they may sin no
more."

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:44.060
Notice corruption,
impurity, pleasure,

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:48.690
death, those are all linked
together.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:54.394
And here's the clue that helps
you see what's going on with the

00:27:54.394 --> 00:27:59.180
allure of asceticism for these
ancient Christians.

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:02.176
In the ancient world…
This is something that's also

00:28:02.176 --> 00:28:04.068
changed radically since the
1970s.

00:28:04.068 --> 00:28:09.520
The 1970s changed dramatically
with regard to family,

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.778
sexuality.
 

00:28:10.778 --> 00:28:13.028
It's the time of the sexual
revolution.

00:28:13.028 --> 00:28:18.240
The time of the people's
attitudes changing completely.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.852
We went back on that in the
1980s with the AIDs scare,

00:28:21.852 --> 00:28:25.805
and then the way right wingers
used AIDS to try to make sex

00:28:25.805 --> 00:28:27.509
fearful to everybody.
 

00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:29.730
But that was sort of
reactionary.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:33.049
The 1980s and a lot of the
1990s was reactionary to the

00:28:33.049 --> 00:28:34.279
sexual revolution.
 

00:28:34.279 --> 00:28:37.537
What happened in the 1970s that
changed the way people thought

00:28:37.537 --> 00:28:39.140
about these sorts of things?
 

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:44.623
Two things that were big pushes
toward changing people's

00:28:44.623 --> 00:28:48.910
attitudes about sexuality and
the family.

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:51.633
The women's movement,
which basically was springing

00:28:51.633 --> 00:28:54.791
off the civil rights movement
and saying that women and men

00:28:54.791 --> 00:28:57.307
are equal,
the radical notion that women

00:28:57.307 --> 00:29:01.380
are people is what feminism is,
so women and men are equal.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:04.630
Now why was that so important
for issues like sex?

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:08.481
Because the way sexuality had
always been construed up to that

00:29:08.481 --> 00:29:10.818
point was that the sex act
itself,

00:29:10.818 --> 00:29:14.596
the heterosexual sex act--and
homosexual sex acts were always

00:29:14.596 --> 00:29:17.618
interpreted in the frame of
heterosexual sex--

00:29:17.618 --> 00:29:21.430
the heterosexual sex act
embodies in its very practices

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:23.829
the hierarchy of man over woman.
 

00:29:23.829 --> 00:29:26.380
The idea is, man is superior.
 

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:27.868
He's supposed to be on top.
 

00:29:27.868 --> 00:29:31.160
So the preferred position is
the missionary position.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.268
And in fact,
in ancient Judaism and

00:29:33.268 --> 00:29:36.058
Christianity it was considered
abominable--

00:29:36.058 --> 00:29:38.598
it was considered sex
"against nature"--

00:29:38.598 --> 00:29:42.569
to have the woman penetrate the
man in any way.

00:29:42.569 --> 00:29:43.900
Why?
 

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.891
Because they considered it only
natural that the man is the

00:29:46.891 --> 00:29:49.109
superior one and he penetrates
the woman.

00:29:49.109 --> 00:29:53.098
It's male to penetrate;
it's feminine to be penetrated.

00:29:53.098 --> 00:29:56.768
And they believed that whether
it was penis/vagina sex,

00:29:56.768 --> 00:30:00.640
or whether it was oral sex,
or whether it was anything.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.440
Any kind of sexual intercourse
in the ancient world,

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.413
and this continued pretty much
all the way until the modern

00:30:05.413 --> 00:30:06.932
world,
the man is superior,

00:30:06.932 --> 00:30:10.130
masculinity is superior,
and femininity is inferior.

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:14.461
And that's embodied in the sex
act itsel: the superiority of

00:30:14.461 --> 00:30:18.500
the penetrator and the
inferiority of the penetrated.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:22.638
That's why the word
"fucked,"

00:30:22.638 --> 00:30:26.183
is a bad thing,
although actually most of think

00:30:26.183 --> 00:30:28.740
actually doing it is not
such a bad thing.

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.561
Why is that in our--in slang
and curse words we still use

00:30:32.561 --> 00:30:35.019
words like "that
sucks"?

00:30:35.019 --> 00:30:38.182
A lot of people don't even know
that it refers to sex,

00:30:38.182 --> 00:30:40.450
but yeah of course it refers to
sex.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:42.548
Something that
"sucks"

00:30:42.548 --> 00:30:45.528
is considered bad,
it's not considered bad to

00:30:45.528 --> 00:30:46.950
be sucked.
 

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:50.973
Something that fucks is not
bad, it's considered bad to be

00:30:50.973 --> 00:30:51.609
fucked.
 

00:30:51.609 --> 00:30:52.910
Why is that?
 

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:56.849
Because our entire history has
penetration is superior;

00:30:56.849 --> 00:30:59.609
it's inferior to be penetrated.
 

00:30:59.609 --> 00:31:01.710
It's embodied in our culture.
 

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:04.442
That started to be
challenged--now see you may find

00:31:04.442 --> 00:31:07.501
this kind of weird that I'm
insisting so literally on the

00:31:07.501 --> 00:31:10.780
interpretation of these words
because that may not be the way

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.528
you use them or hear them.
 

00:31:12.528 --> 00:31:15.878
What I'm saying is that if it's
not the way you use them or hear

00:31:15.878 --> 00:31:18.856
them is because society has
changed radically in the last

00:31:18.856 --> 00:31:20.240
thirty or forty years.
 

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:24.337
No longer is it automatically
considered that women are

00:31:24.337 --> 00:31:27.198
inferior to men,
and therefore the sex act is

00:31:27.198 --> 00:31:29.730
not considered to be one that
necessarily has to be

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:30.440
hierarchal.
 

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.798
The reason that people in the
ancient world,

00:31:32.798 --> 00:31:35.931
if they opposed homosexual sex,
the reason they opposed it is

00:31:35.931 --> 00:31:39.220
they assumed that one man would
have to be penetrated by another

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.073
man,
and that was horrible because

00:31:41.073 --> 00:31:42.410
it disrupted the hierarchy.
 

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.526
Or a woman would have to
penetrate another woman,

00:31:44.526 --> 00:31:46.288
and that also disrupted the
hierarchy.

00:31:46.288 --> 00:31:50.230
It has to be man/woman because
the hierarchy is man/woman,

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:54.308
and every sex act was supposed
to imitate that hierarchy.

00:31:54.308 --> 00:31:56.828
That changed radically
beginning in the 1970s.

00:31:56.828 --> 00:31:59.740
The other big thing that
changed was the Pill.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:03.412
Now of course there had been
contraception for years and

00:32:03.412 --> 00:32:06.150
years before that,
for time immemorial.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:10.309
Human beings have always known
how to avoid getting pregnant to

00:32:10.309 --> 00:32:11.250
some extent.
 

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:17.019
But with the 1970s and the wide
availability of contraceptive

00:32:17.019 --> 00:32:20.064
medicines,
drugs, it was much easier to

00:32:20.064 --> 00:32:24.037
have heterosexual sex and not be
worried about whether you were

00:32:24.037 --> 00:32:25.640
going to get pregnant.
 

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.267
Before that,
and this is also something that

00:32:27.267 --> 00:32:29.272
people your age just have
trouble getting through your

00:32:29.272 --> 00:32:32.708
heads,
before that every time a woman

00:32:32.708 --> 00:32:38.038
had heterosexual sex of any kind
of penetrated way--

00:32:38.038 --> 00:32:40.960
the normal way people were
having sex she was--

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.493
she had to at least be partly
worried that she was going to

00:32:43.493 --> 00:32:44.150
get pregnant.
 

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:47.391
Every time a man and a woman
had sex, pregnancy,

00:32:47.391 --> 00:32:51.046
the danger of pregnancy,
was always there hanging over

00:32:51.046 --> 00:32:52.150
their heads.
 

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:54.063
They could accept it and they
could want it,

00:32:54.063 --> 00:32:56.644
but if they didn't want it,
it was still hanging over their

00:32:56.644 --> 00:32:57.089
heads.
 

00:32:57.089 --> 00:32:59.519
That's not true for us today.
 

00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:03.971
We have enough reliable means
of contraception that we can

00:33:03.971 --> 00:33:08.894
pretty much decide that we want
to have sex just for fun without

00:33:08.894 --> 00:33:11.160
worrying about pregnancy.
 

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.318
These two things,
the women's movement,

00:33:13.318 --> 00:33:16.058
which challenged the basic
hierarchy of the sex act,

00:33:16.058 --> 00:33:19.318
and the availability of
contraception,

00:33:19.318 --> 00:33:23.078
radically changed notions of
sex.

00:33:23.078 --> 00:33:25.656
Before that,
and here's what goes back to

00:33:25.656 --> 00:33:28.821
the ancient world,
I've mentioned this before and

00:33:28.821 --> 00:33:32.145
we've been talking about other
texts already but just to

00:33:32.145 --> 00:33:37.442
review: for the ancient mind,
sex was simply one cog in a

00:33:37.442 --> 00:33:38.299
wheel.
 

00:33:38.299 --> 00:33:40.680
Why did you have sex?
 

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.680
In order to make babies.
 

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.230
Why did you need to make babies?
 

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:46.328
Because so many of them were
dying all the time.

00:33:46.328 --> 00:33:48.634
I think I've told you the
statistic that in the ancient

00:33:48.634 --> 00:33:50.680
world,
for the population of the Roman

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.986
Empire just to remain stable--
not for it to grow,

00:33:52.986 --> 00:33:56.160
just for it to remain stable--
every woman who lived to

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.789
childbearing age,
which was considered about

00:33:58.789 --> 00:34:02.094
fourteen in the ancient world,
had to have an average of five

00:34:02.094 --> 00:34:05.578
childbirths for the population
to remain stable.

00:34:05.578 --> 00:34:08.771
Think of these girls,
every one of you would have to

00:34:08.771 --> 00:34:12.590
have at least five childbirths
on average just to maintain the

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:13.530
population.
 

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:17.382
That just shows how many people
died in childbirth,

00:34:17.382 --> 00:34:21.235
how many women died in
childbirth, how many infants

00:34:21.235 --> 00:34:21.929
died.
 

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:25.922
So in people's minds,
every birth was automatically

00:34:25.922 --> 00:34:28.480
linked in their mind to death.
 

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.510
Because it was a dangerous
thing, people died often in

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.715
childbirth, women died giving
birth, and so many children

00:34:34.715 --> 00:34:35.230
died.
 

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:38.298
They also knew that they had to
keep having babies or the

00:34:38.298 --> 00:34:40.996
population would shrink,
and populations in the ancient

00:34:40.996 --> 00:34:43.880
world did often shrink,
and that was dangerous because

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.750
whole cities could disappear.
 

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:49.963
Whole populations could
disappear if the birthrate

00:34:49.963 --> 00:34:51.768
didn't remain high.
 

00:34:51.768 --> 00:34:54.583
Every birth was
considered--because you had to

00:34:54.583 --> 00:34:56.550
have babies;
why do you need babies?

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:58.030
Because people were always
dying.

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:03.481
The idea was you have sex,
birth, death,

00:35:03.481 --> 00:35:04.599
decay.
 

00:35:04.599 --> 00:35:09.117
Sex, birth, death,
decay, sex, birth,

00:35:09.117 --> 00:35:14.139
death, decay,
that's all what life is.

00:35:14.139 --> 00:35:19.768
Life is a big circle of sex,
birth, death and decay.

00:35:19.768 --> 00:35:25.425
Now comes Christianity which
says, we're going to teach you

00:35:25.425 --> 00:35:27.570
to break that cycle.
 

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:30.469
How do you break the cycle?
 

00:35:30.469 --> 00:35:32.369
Well, it may not be intuitive
to you,

00:35:32.369 --> 00:35:35.112
but this seemed to be intuitive
to a lot of ancient people who

00:35:35.112 --> 00:35:37.809
incorporated this into their
teachings about Christianity.

00:35:37.809 --> 00:35:40.719
The Christians said,
stop it at sex.

00:35:40.719 --> 00:35:43.219
Break the cycle at sex.
 

00:35:43.219 --> 00:35:46.050
And that's why in these
text--it's not intuitive to us,

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:48.847
but it's intuitive to
them--that if you want to stop

00:35:48.847 --> 00:35:50.827
that cycle of sex,
birth, death,

00:35:50.827 --> 00:35:54.652
and decay the easiest place for
human beings to stop it is at

00:35:54.652 --> 00:35:55.099
sex.
 

00:35:55.099 --> 00:35:56.980
Just break the cycle.
 

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.755
Don't have sex,
don't have childbirth,

00:35:59.755 --> 00:36:01.179
don't have death.
 

00:36:01.179 --> 00:36:03.777
And of course they believed
they had an answer for the death

00:36:03.777 --> 00:36:06.123
part because they believed,
with Christianity,

00:36:06.123 --> 00:36:08.572
with Jesus Christ,
you would have resurrection,

00:36:08.572 --> 00:36:11.625
the body would be raised,
so you don't need childbirth

00:36:11.625 --> 00:36:12.199
anymore.
 

00:36:12.199 --> 00:36:15.996
If you're a faithful Christian
you'll live forever anyway,

00:36:15.996 --> 00:36:19.927
so you don't need to replenish
the population by having more

00:36:19.927 --> 00:36:20.659
babies.
 

00:36:20.659 --> 00:36:23.097
All the people who are
Christians, who come into

00:36:23.097 --> 00:36:25.641
Christ, will be resurrected and
will live forever,

00:36:25.641 --> 00:36:28.340
so there's no need for more and
more population.

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:32.230
The reason that these texts,
and this is not the only one,

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:34.489
this is just one place where
it's very clear,

00:36:34.489 --> 00:36:37.972
because whenever Paul talks
about sex he also talks about

00:36:37.972 --> 00:36:38.469
death.
 

00:36:38.469 --> 00:36:42.210
He talks about corruption and
he talks about resurrection.

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:46.894
So this text very clearly pulls
all of these issues into one

00:36:46.894 --> 00:36:47.690
another.
 

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:52.179
The basic sensibility of this
gospel that we moderns don't

00:36:52.179 --> 00:36:53.664
have,
and you have to imagine

00:36:53.664 --> 00:36:57.748
yourself back into their world,
is the radical availability of

00:36:57.748 --> 00:37:03.369
death and the linkage of death
with sex in ancient minds,

00:37:03.369 --> 00:37:07.710
and then also the linkage of
all these other things with

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:10.630
sexuality and death and
corruption.

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:14.298
Christianity said,
stop the cycle at sex and you

00:37:14.298 --> 00:37:17.813
get rid of death,
radical as that may sound to

00:37:17.813 --> 00:37:18.360
us.
 

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:22.039
The problem of course is,
in this text,

00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:25.972
the people who find that
message very compelling are

00:37:25.972 --> 00:37:27.996
young women,
a lot of wives,

00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:31.630
although not all of them,
and even young men.

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:35.478
Also, people who find that
message compelling happen to be

00:37:35.478 --> 00:37:36.289
lionesses.
 

00:37:36.289 --> 00:37:40.364
The female animals also like
this message,

00:37:40.364 --> 00:37:41.159
right?
 

00:37:41.159 --> 00:37:44.608
Who are the ones who gang up on
the bad male animals who are

00:37:44.608 --> 00:37:46.889
trying to attack Thecla in the
arena?

00:37:46.889 --> 00:37:48.059
The female lion.
 

00:37:48.059 --> 00:37:52.389
The text is set up as an
opposition.

00:37:52.389 --> 00:37:55.503
Now notice, I said young men
are also included in the good

00:37:55.503 --> 00:37:56.869
side of this sometimes.
 

00:37:56.869 --> 00:37:59.860
What is the opposition to
Paul's gospel?

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:03.000
It's not men versus women,
right?

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.360
What is the opposition?
 

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:10.376
It's male heads of households
against everybody else who would

00:38:10.376 --> 00:38:13.010
be members of their household.
 

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:17.545
The people who opposed Paul the
most in this text are male heads

00:38:17.545 --> 00:38:20.552
of households,
precisely because they

00:38:20.552 --> 00:38:25.574
recognize that challenging the
centrality of sex and childbirth

00:38:25.574 --> 00:38:29.219
will in itself challenge their
households.

00:38:29.219 --> 00:38:31.521
In their system,
you have to have sex and

00:38:31.521 --> 00:38:34.860
childbirth in order to maintain
the household structure.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.164
They're the ones who are
against Paul,

00:38:37.164 --> 00:38:40.340
so Paul appeals mostly to women
and young people.

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:43.204
I already think--I read part of
that in paragraph 7,

00:38:43.204 --> 00:38:46.690
"The women and the virgins
are going to hear him."

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:52.032
In paragraph 9 it talks about
women and young people going to

00:38:52.032 --> 00:38:56.219
him and are talking to him,
so that's who it.

00:38:56.219 --> 00:39:01.909
Then in 12, I read this passage
in paragraph 12,

00:39:01.909 --> 00:39:05.103
"He deprives young men of
wives and maidens of

00:39:05.103 --> 00:39:07.916
husbands,"
so he's depriving the men who

00:39:07.916 --> 00:39:11.878
want to continue the household
structure and that's why they're

00:39:11.878 --> 00:39:13.219
opposed to him.
 

00:39:13.219 --> 00:39:26.547
Notice paragraph 26 and 27:
this guy sees Thecla in a

00:39:26.547 --> 00:39:36.286
different place,
Alexander sees Thecla,

00:39:36.286 --> 00:39:45.000
and he falls in love with her.
 

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.932
As is typical in these kinds of
texts, there's always a

00:39:47.932 --> 00:39:50.159
beautiful woman,
no man can resist her.

00:39:50.159 --> 00:39:54.619
He says he wants to marry her:
"I did not wish to marry

00:39:54.619 --> 00:39:56.079
Thamyris, I've been cast out of
the city ...

00:39:56.079 --> 00:39:58.835
Taking hold of Alexander [so
here she takes hold of this

00:39:58.835 --> 00:40:00.590
Alexander]
she ripped his cloak,

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:03.331
took off the crown from his
head and made him a laughing

00:40:03.331 --> 00:40:03.730
stock.
 

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:06.510
But he, partly out of love for
her and partly in shame at what

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:08.286
had befallen him,
brought her before the

00:40:08.286 --> 00:40:08.880
governor.
 

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.177
And when she confessed that she
had done these things he

00:40:11.177 --> 00:40:12.429
condemned her to the beasts.
 

00:40:12.429 --> 00:40:15.117
But the women were panic
stricken and cried out before

00:40:15.117 --> 00:40:17.349
the judgment seat,
"An evil judgment!

00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:18.230
A godless judgment!"
 

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:20.766
But Thecla asked the governor
that she might remain pure until

00:40:20.766 --> 00:40:22.179
she was to fight with the beast.
 

00:40:22.179 --> 00:40:24.170
[In other words she says;
just don't make me have sex.

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:26.420
I'll be glad to go into the
arena and fight with the beast,

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:29.789
just don't make me have sex.]
A rich woman named Tryphaena,

00:40:29.789 --> 00:40:30.387
whose wife [correction:
husband]

00:40:30.387 --> 00:40:31.519
had died,
took her under her protection

00:40:31.519 --> 00:40:32.110
and found comfort.
 

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:34.974
When the beasts were led in
procession they bound her to a

00:40:34.974 --> 00:40:36.885
fierce lioness,
and the Queen Tryphaena

00:40:36.885 --> 00:40:37.739
followed her.
 

00:40:37.739 --> 00:40:40.561
And as Thecla sat upon her
back, the lioness licked her

00:40:40.561 --> 00:40:42.860
feet, and all the crowed was
amazed."

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:46.521
You have this situation
where--what's the problem with

00:40:46.521 --> 00:40:47.349
Alexander?
 

00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:48.980
He's shamed.
 

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:51.356
So in this honor/shame system
of the ancient world,

00:40:51.356 --> 00:40:53.971
this is also an important
point: male heads of household

00:40:53.971 --> 00:40:55.539
occupy the position of honor.
 

00:40:55.539 --> 00:40:59.139
By tearing his clothes,
by knocking his crown off,

00:40:59.139 --> 00:41:02.170
she shames him in public,
and this of course totally

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:05.320
disrupts this hierarchy of the
man over the woman,

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.260
and that's part of what's going
on here.

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:10.288
Women who refuse their role as
child bearers,

00:41:10.288 --> 00:41:13.315
as sex objects,
shame the men who put them in

00:41:13.315 --> 00:41:14.280
that role.
 

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:18.400
And so that's what the conflict
is about, shaming men and

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.639
rebelling against the household
structure.

00:41:21.639 --> 00:41:24.579
Then of course there's the
solidarity of women with

00:41:24.579 --> 00:41:25.579
everybody else.
 

00:41:25.579 --> 00:41:28.992
Notice in this,
Paul himself is rather

00:41:28.992 --> 00:41:30.929
ambiguously placed.
 

00:41:30.929 --> 00:41:31.809
He's a man.
 

00:41:31.809 --> 00:41:35.280
What is Paul's role in all of
this?

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:38.916
I think it's interesting that
Paul doesn't come across in this

00:41:38.916 --> 00:41:42.255
text, at least in my reading,
as being a totally positive

00:41:42.255 --> 00:41:43.090
character.
 

00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:44.806
It praises him,
of course, and presents him as

00:41:44.806 --> 00:41:45.380
a man of God.
 

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:47.820
But notice some of the things
that Paul does.

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:50.880
Paul refuses to baptize her.
 

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.909
Remember, she has to baptize
herself.

00:41:53.909 --> 00:41:57.329
This is that wonderful scene
where she's being martyred--

00:41:57.329 --> 00:41:58.489
they're trying to martyr her
again,

00:41:58.489 --> 00:42:02.291
and they strip her naked,
and then they have this big vat

00:42:02.291 --> 00:42:07.820
of killer man-eating seals--
yes that's what it says.

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:11.835
You probably didn't even know
there were man-eating seals,

00:42:11.835 --> 00:42:15.500
but there were in the ancient
Mediterranean world.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:19.101
Instead of waiting to be thrown
into the vat of man eating

00:42:19.101 --> 00:42:20.896
seals,
a lightning bolt comes out of

00:42:20.896 --> 00:42:22.032
the sky,
strikes the water,

00:42:22.032 --> 00:42:24.480
all the man-eating seals die,
so God saves her.

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:27.905
And then, though,
not to let the scene finish

00:42:27.905 --> 00:42:29.268
she--
she's all right,

00:42:29.268 --> 00:42:31.572
there's water,
she's asked Paul to baptize her

00:42:31.572 --> 00:42:35.632
once and he wouldn't do it,
so she throws herself into the

00:42:35.632 --> 00:42:37.940
water and baptizes herself.
 

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:39.139
This is a woman!
 

00:42:39.139 --> 00:42:41.489
You're not supposed to let
women go around baptizing

00:42:41.489 --> 00:42:42.090
themselves!
 

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:44.949
That could just disrupt all
kinds of stuff.

00:42:44.949 --> 00:42:48.362
Paul, at one point,
says he doesn't even know her

00:42:48.362 --> 00:42:49.429
in one place.
 

00:42:49.429 --> 00:42:50.920
He refuses to baptize her.
 

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.920
And Paul gets in trouble.
 

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.760
He runs off and hides in caves
and stuff.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.449
Who's the big hero of this
story?

00:42:57.449 --> 00:42:58.570
It's not Paul.
 

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:02.139
He's one of the heroes
but it's really Thecla.

00:43:02.139 --> 00:43:07.034
It's this woman who totally
refuses to accept her role as a

00:43:07.034 --> 00:43:08.300
baby factory.
 

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:11.570
And that's what women are in
the ancient world,

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:12.780
baby factories.
 

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.768
She totally refuses to accept
that role.

00:43:14.768 --> 00:43:18.039
She baptizes herself when Paul
hesitates to baptize her.

00:43:18.039 --> 00:43:20.355
And then of course at the very
end of the document,

00:43:20.355 --> 00:43:21.420
remember how it ends?
 

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:24.110
She goes to Paul and she says
she wants to be a follower of

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:26.289
his, and he kind of--again he
kind of just says,

00:43:26.289 --> 00:43:27.449
no go leave me alone.
 

00:43:27.449 --> 00:43:30.380
Paul is not all that great with
her.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.139
What does she do?
 

00:43:32.139 --> 00:43:33.829
First she inherits a bunch of
money;

00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:36.380
another rich woman left her a
ton of money,

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:39.420
so she's able to support
herself and her mother.

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.527
I guess she and her mother,
by the end of the thing,

00:43:41.527 --> 00:43:42.518
are now on good terms.
 

00:43:42.518 --> 00:43:45.391
I mean if you survive
lightening and man-eating seals,

00:43:45.391 --> 00:43:48.045
and God saves you,
maybe your mother will like you

00:43:48.045 --> 00:43:50.159
better and let you not get
married.

00:43:50.159 --> 00:43:52.842
She supports herself
financially through an

00:43:52.842 --> 00:43:55.652
inheritance that she gets from
another woman,

00:43:55.652 --> 00:43:57.570
and then what does she do?
 

00:43:57.570 --> 00:44:00.465
She cuts her hair short,
she dresses like a man,

00:44:00.465 --> 00:44:02.559
she actually becomes an
Apostle.

00:44:02.559 --> 00:44:06.284
She goes off to spread the
message of this ascetic,

00:44:06.284 --> 00:44:08.148
sex avoiding,
anti-family,

00:44:08.148 --> 00:44:11.800
anti-household gospel that she
got from Paul.

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:16.730
Thecla becomes her own Apostle
spreading the message.

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:19.659
Notice what kind of gospel
she's going around teaching.

00:44:19.659 --> 00:44:22.137
This is not pro-family,
this is not patriotic,

00:44:22.137 --> 00:44:23.570
this is not nationalism.
 

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:27.760
This is putting all your eggs
in the basket of the kingdom of

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:28.179
God.
 

00:44:28.179 --> 00:44:30.880
That's the only thing worth
living for, is the kingdom of

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.170
God.
 

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:33.320
How do you get into the kingdom
of God?

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:36.063
By avoiding sex and avoiding
the household,

00:44:36.063 --> 00:44:39.070
that's how you get in and
enjoy--and remain.

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:40.469
How do you avoid death?
 

00:44:40.469 --> 00:44:43.960
By being resurrected.
 

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.969
This message is a very erotic
message, in a sense.

00:44:46.969 --> 00:44:49.829
It's not getting sexual
eroticism or sexual desire and

00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:51.610
throwing it all out the window.
 

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:55.896
It's actually using eroticism
and the appeal to beauty,

00:44:55.896 --> 00:45:00.344
and the appeal of sexual
desire, and it's capitalizing on

00:45:00.344 --> 00:45:00.900
it.
 

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:04.849
The author is trying to get
you, as a young person who's

00:45:04.849 --> 00:45:08.282
afraid about death,
to convert to a message of the

00:45:08.282 --> 00:45:12.052
gospel that will liberate you
from the cycle of corruption and

00:45:12.052 --> 00:45:15.204
death,
that you will get into if you

00:45:15.204 --> 00:45:18.697
agree to go along with sex,
birth, death,

00:45:18.697 --> 00:45:23.050
decay, and that's what you do
if you choose the household.

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:25.679
It's a radical document.
 

00:45:25.679 --> 00:45:30.250
Now the question is,
is this a feminist document?

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:32.159
It's a good question.
 

00:45:32.159 --> 00:45:34.940
Its raises Thecla up even above
Paul,

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:38.320
and it gives a message of
liberation to women,

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:42.186
at least from whatever it is
that keeps them down at the

00:45:42.186 --> 00:45:43.826
time,
which is the patriarchal

00:45:43.826 --> 00:45:44.320
household.
 

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.510
It gives them a way out of that.
 

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:49.726
This is one of the reasons that
there are a lot of women in the

00:45:49.726 --> 00:45:52.760
ancient world who became nuns,
who wanted to avoid the

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:56.210
household, and you had women
running away from their husbands

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:57.130
all the time.
 

00:45:57.130 --> 00:45:58.739
Church leaders talk about it.
 

00:45:58.739 --> 00:45:59.860
Why?
 

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.387
Because that was--you had to
get out of the household if you

00:46:02.387 --> 00:46:04.659
wanted to have any kind of
independence or liberty.

00:46:04.659 --> 00:46:07.757
If you wanted to have any kind
of exercise of power you had to

00:46:07.757 --> 00:46:09.889
get out of the male dominated
household.

00:46:09.889 --> 00:46:12.092
So Christianity,
the whole strain of

00:46:12.092 --> 00:46:15.869
Christianity appealed to
precisely those kinds of people,

00:46:15.869 --> 00:46:18.762
and the author is trying to get
you as a young person to make

00:46:18.762 --> 00:46:19.679
that choice also.
 

00:46:19.679 --> 00:46:24.199
Now the big question is do you
think it's feminist?

00:46:24.199 --> 00:46:27.661
Is this feminism or is there
something wrong with thinking

00:46:27.661 --> 00:46:29.059
about it as feminism?
 

00:46:29.059 --> 00:46:32.367
If you're writing a paper this
week maybe you can talk about

00:46:32.367 --> 00:46:32.760
that.
 

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:37.523
Another big question is,
do you think this author is

00:46:37.523 --> 00:46:41.539
actually attacking the Pastoral
Epistles?

00:46:41.539 --> 00:46:45.250
Are the Pastoral Epistles
attacking this author?

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:49.826
They are presenting two
diametrically opposed versions

00:46:49.826 --> 00:46:50.690
of Paul.
 

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:52.550
They both claim Paul as their
author.

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:55.452
They both claim to be
representing Paul's gospel,

00:46:55.452 --> 00:46:56.480
Paul's message.
 

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.728
But one of them is very
pro-household,

00:46:59.728 --> 00:47:03.239
and marriage,
and sex, and childbirth;

00:47:03.239 --> 00:47:06.777
and the other is anti-marriage,
anti-household,

00:47:06.777 --> 00:47:09.239
anti-childbirth,
and anti-sex.

00:47:09.239 --> 00:47:12.539
They both claim Paul as the
author of their gospel.

00:47:12.539 --> 00:47:13.840
Do they know each other?
 

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.349
That's the interesting
historical question.

00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:19.300
Or is it just by accident that
we have these two very radically

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.530
different appropriations of
Paul?

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:24.574
All of those questions I hope
you'll talk about in your

00:47:24.574 --> 00:47:26.659
discussion groups later this
week,

00:47:26.659 --> 00:47:29.976
and if you're writing papers,
push yourself to answer some

00:47:29.976 --> 00:47:31.780
big questions in your papers.
 

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:32.960
Any questions?
 

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.440
Yes.
 

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.844
Student:  Is it possible
or conceivable that a woman

00:47:36.844 --> 00:47:37.840
would have written it?
 

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.916
Prof: Is it possible or
conceivable that a woman would

00:47:39.916 --> 00:47:40.539
have written it?
 

00:47:40.539 --> 00:47:41.989
It's completely possible.
 

00:47:41.989 --> 00:47:44.360
We don't know who the author
was.

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:47.679
Wait, is this the one
that--what's the one that

00:47:47.679 --> 00:47:51.793
Tertullian says up--okay he
knew--we actually know that it

00:47:51.793 --> 00:47:54.320
was written by a priest,
right?

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.239
Student:  Yes.
 

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:56.931
Prof: This one wasn't
written by a woman,

00:47:56.931 --> 00:47:59.018
but for some of the text in the
ancient world they could be

00:47:59.018 --> 00:48:00.585
written by--
Student:  Not everyone

00:48:00.585 --> 00:48:01.280
believes Tertullian.
 

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.539
Prof: What?
 

00:48:02.539 --> 00:48:04.230
Student:  Not everyone
believes Tertullian.

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:05.889
Student: 
&gt;

00:48:05.889 --> 00:48:08.010
Prof: Okay
Tertullian--some people say

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:09.119
Tertullian was wrong.
 

00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:11.735
Tertullian is a church father
who wrote around the year 200 in

00:48:11.735 --> 00:48:12.079
Latin.
 

00:48:12.079 --> 00:48:14.340
He knows the story,
and he condemns it partly

00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:16.960
because he doesn't want Thecla
baptizing herself.

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:21.280
She's too big for her britches
in Tertullian's view.

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:25.634
Tertullian says that they know
who wrote it and it was a man

00:48:25.634 --> 00:48:30.210
but the Teaching Fellow says
that other people dispute that.

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:33.050
Okay, see you next week.

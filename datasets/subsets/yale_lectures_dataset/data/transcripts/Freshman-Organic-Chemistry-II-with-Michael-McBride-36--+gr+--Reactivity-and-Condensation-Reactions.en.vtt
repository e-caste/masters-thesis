J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE:
Since it's going to take a

00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.000
minute for this to start up,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.367
I'll show you a 
demonstration here.

00:00:23.267 --> 00:00:24.500
It's a way to make tea. 

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:39.933
It's a really clever device
called a Soxhlet extractor. 

00:00:48.067 --> 00:00:54.800
And it was invented in order to
extract stuff from like bark or

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.800
leaves or something like that. 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.500
Something that's very insoluble.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.133
So you could imagine to do it
like tea. 

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:05.100
You put it in a filter paper,
pour solvent through it, some 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.300
of it dissolves, it goes on
through, and then you have to 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.200
concentrate the solution. 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.500
But there's another way to do
it, which is to 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.767
use this thing here- 

00:01:16.767 --> 00:01:18.033
How are we doing? 

00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:26.867
Let's see if I can get the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.767
show up here. 

00:01:35.067 --> 00:01:38.100
So the idea is that the problem
with that is that the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.967
stuff isn't very soluble. 

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:44.367
It takes an enormous amount of
solvent to get it out. 

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:48.267
So what was invented by this man
Soxhlet- 

00:01:48.267 --> 00:01:49.833
and I'm having trouble here. 

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:51.067
It says audience. 

00:02:00.767 --> 00:02:03.867
Why is this not on? 

00:02:03.867 --> 00:02:04.167
Oh. 

00:02:04.167 --> 00:02:05.433
Somebody's unplugged it. 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.267
Sorry for the confusion here. 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.933
We're technically challenged
today. 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.667
There we go. 

00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:37.633
OK. 

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:46.033
So what we have here is a flask
down below that's going 

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:48.000
to have the solvent, and not
very much solvent. 

00:02:52.267 --> 00:02:55.433
Let me get it like that. 

00:02:55.433 --> 00:02:58.167
And so we're going to boil the
solvent. 

00:02:58.167 --> 00:03:02.600
It's going to come up through
this arm here, up to a 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.133
condenser, and then drip into
the tea leaves, or whatever it 

00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:12.733
is we want to extract, held in a
little cup inside here. 

00:03:12.733 --> 00:03:16.067
And it's solid down here, so
this is just a cup. 

00:03:16.067 --> 00:03:20.733
But there's this funny snakelike
tube that comes from 

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:25.400
the bottom of this, up, around,
down, and back inside, 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.400
toward the flask. 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.933
So watch what happens when I
pour some liquid in here. 

00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:53.500
So if you just pour water
through a filter, the water 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.133
runs through very rapidly. 

00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:58.700
It doesn't have time to become
saturated. 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.400
So it's inefficient in two ways.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.200
You've got to pour lots of water
through, and it doesn't 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.400
get saturated on the way
through. 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.333
This way, the liquid you
distilled up drips down in 

00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:12.633
there, sits with the stuff,
which is held, remember, in 

00:04:12.633 --> 00:04:16.100
like a filter paper inside here.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.533
And you can see that the
liquid-- 

00:04:19.533 --> 00:04:22.533
see if I can get it so you can
see. 

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:26.800
Did you see that the liquid went
not only of course in 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.200
here, where it's with the tea
leaves, but also through tube 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.867
and up that far? 

00:04:33.867 --> 00:04:34.867
So it's there. 

00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:37.600
You can see the meniscus in the
side arm. 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.133
Now, what's going to happen when
I pour a little more in? 

00:04:41.133 --> 00:04:43.567
Drip, drip, drip, actually, of
course, from a condenser. 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.933
It's getting right up to the top
of that side arm. 

00:04:51.933 --> 00:04:53.167
What's going to happen? 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.600
So it's sitting there and
becoming saturated. 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.833
Then we go a little bit more. 

00:05:06.567 --> 00:05:07.767
What's it doing? 

00:05:11.867 --> 00:05:14.133
It siphons, right? 

00:05:14.133 --> 00:05:17.533
But it sits there with the hot
liquid until 

00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:18.867
it gets to the top. 

00:05:18.867 --> 00:05:20.600
Then it draws all that off. 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.400
And then what happens? 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.500
More liquid boils up and comes
in and dissolves. 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.067
It's the same liquid, of course.

00:05:31.067 --> 00:05:34.100
It's been distilled now. 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.767
So it comes on up, and pretty
soon-- 

00:05:36.767 --> 00:05:39.700
it'll go a little quicker this
time, because there's are drops

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.967
in the side arm. 

00:05:48.267 --> 00:05:50.500
And it drains again. 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.700
So you use just a small amount
of liquid over and over again. 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.567
And there are no moving parts,
right, except the boiling and 

00:05:57.567 --> 00:05:59.067
the liquid. 

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:03.533
So it's really beautiful design
of a clever apparatus, 

00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:04.967
if you want to make tea
efficiently. 

00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:26.533
Now this is starting up. 

00:06:31.533 --> 00:06:36.467
And if I'm lucky, it will have
backed up my most recent work. 

00:07:51.167 --> 00:07:52.367
It's got almost all of it. 

00:07:52.367 --> 00:08:05.933
That's good. 

00:08:05.933 --> 00:08:15.967
See if it will come 
on here.

00:08:15.967 --> 00:08:16.967
Yeah.

00:08:41.067 --> 00:08:41.467
OK. 

00:08:41.467 --> 00:08:44.933
Thanks for bearing with me. 

00:08:44.933 --> 00:08:49.667
So a little more about the
reactivity of acid 

00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:55.333
derivatives, and then on to the
sugar glucose proof, one 

00:08:55.333 --> 00:09:00.233
of the finest logical creations
of 

00:09:00.233 --> 00:09:02.733
the 19th century-- 

00:09:02.733 --> 00:09:04.800
or ever. 

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.433
First, alkylation. 

00:09:09.433 --> 00:09:12.067
We started talking about this
last time, about the fact that 

00:09:12.067 --> 00:09:16.767
an enolate has partial charge,
both on the 

00:09:16.767 --> 00:09:18.500
carbon and the oxygen. 

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.667
So if you want to put an alkyl
group on 

00:09:20.667 --> 00:09:22.733
by an SN2 type reaction-- 

00:09:22.733 --> 00:09:23.400
what's the problem? 

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.533
STUDENT: Are you rehearsing
timings? 

00:09:24.533 --> 00:09:24.933
PROFESSOR: Pardon me? 

00:09:24.933 --> 00:09:26.400
STUDENT: Are you rehearsing
timings? 

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.633
PROFESSOR: Oh, thank you. 

00:09:30.633 --> 00:09:34.167
One more time into the breach
here. 

00:09:34.167 --> 00:09:38.833
John is on the button about
whether I'm 

00:09:38.833 --> 00:09:41.433
rehearsing the timings. 

00:09:41.433 --> 00:09:41.833
OK. 

00:09:41.833 --> 00:09:45.233
So the question is whether you
react with the carbon or the 

00:09:45.233 --> 00:09:49.333
oxygen when you do SN2, when you
react with methyl iodide. 

00:09:49.333 --> 00:09:53.133
Now, you could do a calculation
and see where the 

00:09:53.133 --> 00:09:55.200
HOMO is, right? 

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.000
The HOMO looks like that. 

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.667
It's a pi orbital, obviously,
with one node, in addition to

00:10:02.667 --> 00:10:05.300
the p orbitals that 
it's made of. 

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.133
And that's big on the carbon. 

00:10:07.133 --> 00:10:09.767
So that would favor reaction on
the carbon. 

00:10:09.767 --> 00:10:12.800
And the attack would be from the
top, because it would come 

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.700
in on top of the p-orbital of
the carbon. 

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.467
On the other hand, if you look
at the electrostatic 

00:10:18.467 --> 00:10:21.800
potential, the energy a proton
would have on the surface of 

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.733
this molecule when it's in
contact with it, it's not the 

00:10:25.733 --> 00:10:28.900
most favorable at the position
of the HOMO. 

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.367
It's minus 143 kcal/mole for a
proton that 

00:10:33.367 --> 00:10:34.733
would be there. 

00:10:34.733 --> 00:10:39.267
But a proton here is minus 170
kilocalories per mole. 

00:10:39.267 --> 00:10:44.567
And notice that it not only
favors the oxygen, but it's a 

00:10:44.567 --> 00:10:47.200
sigma attack, rather than a pi
attack. 

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.433
So you could imagine either of
these positions attacking the 

00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:53.100
methyl iodide. 

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.700
Now, in fact it turns out-so
that if it attacked the 

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.533
carbon, it would attack from the
top, as shown up here on 

00:11:00.533 --> 00:11:02.267
the right, out of the plane. 

00:11:02.267 --> 00:11:05.900
If it attacked the oxygen, it
would attack in the plane. 

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.900
And in fact, the major product
is attack on carbon with 

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:10.800
methyl iodide. 

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.867
And it's a negligible amount of
O methylation. 

00:11:14.867 --> 00:11:16.400
But it's not always that way. 

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.367
If you have a different reagent,
a different 

00:11:20.367 --> 00:11:23.600
electrophile to be attacked by
the nucleophile--

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.167
for example, silicon--
displace chloride--

00:11:27.167 --> 00:11:29.200
then it turns out to be just the
other way. 

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.667
It goes on oxygen, 85% yield,
and a negligible 

00:11:32.667 --> 00:11:34.067
amount on the carbon. 

00:11:34.067 --> 00:11:37.533
So this is obviously a finely
balanced thing, and it's not 

00:11:37.533 --> 00:11:40.700
something that you're going to
be able to predict. 

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.667
This is a part of lore, 

00:11:42.667 --> 00:11:46.267
which things go where. 

00:11:46.267 --> 00:11:52.100
Now, if you use a strong anion
base to extract a 

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.667
hydrogen adjacent to the
carbonyl to make the enolate,

00:11:55.667 --> 00:11:57.800
its pKa is 12 units 

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:02.667
higher, so that the equilibrium
lies completely to form the 

00:12:02.667 --> 00:12:04.933
enolate anion. 

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:07.833
But one could imagine two
different enolate anions, where

00:12:07.833 --> 00:12:12.333
a proton's been taken from the
right or from the left. 

00:12:12.333 --> 00:12:15.767
So there's another question
about possible reaction 

00:12:15.767 --> 00:12:18.700
mixtures, when you react this
with methyl iodide. 

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.833
And if it's done with two
equivalents of methyl iodide-- 

00:12:21.833 --> 00:12:26.933
this was done by Professor House
at MIT-- 

00:12:26.933 --> 00:12:34.200
he found that 41% of the product
alkylated on the CH2 

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.900
group, and 9% alkylated on the
group that had a methyl group 

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.533
attached to it already. 

00:12:40.533 --> 00:12:43.033
But these aren't very good
yields. 

00:12:43.033 --> 00:12:47.733
There was also 22% of recovered
starting material. 

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:52.000
So the question is, where did
the proton come from that went 

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.300
on to the recovered starting
material? 

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.600
Now, this was done by adding
methyl iodide 

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.133
to the enolate solution. 

00:13:02.133 --> 00:13:04.700
So there's just a little bit of
methyl iodide there that 

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.867
reacts and makes the ketone, one
of these two 

00:13:08.867 --> 00:13:11.567
ketones down here. 

00:13:11.567 --> 00:13:16.667
But then, additional enolate
could abstract a proton from 

00:13:16.667 --> 00:13:19.867
one of these, and that could
become the new enolate. 

00:13:19.867 --> 00:13:22.867
That could be where the proton
came from to make 

00:13:22.867 --> 00:13:25.133
the starting material. 

00:13:25.133 --> 00:13:29.867
And in fact, 21% of the product
has a second methyl 

00:13:29.867 --> 00:13:34.567
added, and 6% of the product has
three new methyls added to 

00:13:34.567 --> 00:13:35.667
the compound. 

00:13:35.667 --> 00:13:38.733
So it's a real dog's breakfast.
It's not the way 

00:13:38.733 --> 00:13:40.967
you want to do this kind of
thing. 

00:13:40.967 --> 00:13:44.400
It's a very inefficient
reaction. 

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.700
There are other ways to do it,
like for example, use lithium 

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.567
diisopropylamide, another really
strong base. 

00:13:52.567 --> 00:13:55.833
This is done at very low
temperature. 

00:13:55.833 --> 00:14:00.500
And then the people who did this
put in manganese 

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.833
dichloride in a complex with
lithium chloride, again at 

00:14:04.833 --> 00:14:09.267
-78 degrees, and they made a
different enolate anion, the 

00:14:09.267 --> 00:14:13.233
one with manganese as the
counterion. 

00:14:13.233 --> 00:14:20.267
And then they added to this 1.3
equivalence of benzyl 

00:14:20.267 --> 00:14:24.567
bromide and a different solvent,
the 

00:14:24.567 --> 00:14:26.733
n-methylpyrrolidone. 

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:28.600
And did that at room
temperature. 

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.733
Notice this is lore. 

00:14:30.733 --> 00:14:34.933
This is a lot of fine
description of exactly what 

00:14:34.933 --> 00:14:36.700
solvents, what temperatures, and
so on-- 

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.800
how you do it. 

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.033
And under those conditions, they
were able to get 88% of 

00:14:42.033 --> 00:14:45.567
this single product after
distillation. 

00:14:45.567 --> 00:14:45.933
Right? 

00:14:45.933 --> 00:14:48.167
So it's the pure stuff. 

00:14:48.167 --> 00:14:51.167
It's possible to do these
alkylations as a very high 

00:14:51.167 --> 00:14:52.667
yield reaction. 

00:14:52.667 --> 00:14:57.467
Now, this is what's called
an "Org. Syn. Prep."

00:14:57.467 --> 00:15:01.400
When there's a very valuable
technique that people would 

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.800
like to be able to repeat, it's
submitted by the people 

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:11.567
who created it and checked by
people at this at this Organic 

00:15:11.567 --> 00:15:15.167
Syntheses operation, and then
they publish it. 

00:15:15.167 --> 00:15:18.700
And then you can believe that if
you try it, you'll be able 

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.200
to do it here, because it's been
checked. 

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.367
So things that are an "Org. Syn.
Prep." have been very carefully

00:15:24.367 --> 00:15:26.633
done, and all these conditions
are there. 

00:15:26.633 --> 00:15:29.233
But it would be very difficult
ahead of time to figure out 

00:15:29.233 --> 00:15:31.567
exactly all the tricks you need
to do it. 

00:15:31.567 --> 00:15:35.700
But you can look it up in
Organic Syntheses. 

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.067
OK. 

00:15:37.067 --> 00:15:41.733
LDA can also be used with
carboxylic acids. 

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:43.133
So we want to make the enolate.

00:15:43.133 --> 00:15:45.233
We want to extract that red
proton. 

00:15:45.233 --> 00:15:47.700
Can you see any problem involved
when you treat this 

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.533
with a strong base? 

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:52.767
Megan? 

00:15:52.767 --> 00:15:56.433
What's the name of this starting
material? 

00:15:56.433 --> 00:15:58.067
What kind of compound? 

00:15:58.067 --> 00:15:59.467
STUDENT: Carboxylic acid. 

00:15:59.467 --> 00:16:00.267
PROFESSOR: Why do they call it 

00:16:00.267 --> 00:16:02.000
a carboxylic acid? 

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.500
STUDENT: It gives up protons. 

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.867
PROFESSOR: Because it gives up
protons. 

00:16:04.867 --> 00:16:06.333
Is that the proton it gives up?

00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:06.967
STUDENT: No. 

00:16:06.967 --> 00:16:08.100
PROFESSOR: No. 

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.067
It gives that one up. 

00:16:09.067 --> 00:16:11.400
So you don't get the enolate. 

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.333
However, this is a strong enough
base that it's possible 

00:16:15.333 --> 00:16:19.700
to pull off a second proton and
in fact get the enolate, 

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.533
which lacks the [correction:
insert second] negative charge

00:16:21.567 --> 00:16:24.467
that's supposed to be there. 

00:16:24.467 --> 00:16:28.067
And then that can react with an
alkyl bromide at the more 

00:16:28.067 --> 00:16:32.067
nucleophilic, less stable anion
center, and give a good 

00:16:32.067 --> 00:16:35.400
yield of the alkylated acid. 

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.867
It's also even better, of
course, to do dicarbonyls, 

00:16:38.867 --> 00:16:41.200
which are more strongly acidic,
so you don't need 

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.100
these really strong acids
[correction: bases]. 

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.300
So you use ethoxide to do this.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:50.767
It's acidic enough that you
could imagine using hydroxide. 

00:16:50.767 --> 00:16:53.033
But you don't use hydroxide to
do this. 

00:16:53.033 --> 00:16:54.867
You use ethoxide. 

00:16:54.867 --> 00:16:56.133
Can you guess why you use 

00:16:56.133 --> 00:16:57.600
ethoxide rather than hydroxide?

00:17:01.167 --> 00:17:04.333
As always when you begin to get
complicated reactions, and 

00:17:04.333 --> 00:17:07.467
this is not a very complicated
one, there are several ways 

00:17:07.467 --> 00:17:08.867
things can react. 

00:17:08.867 --> 00:17:12.067
And this is not...as in the last
case, where you could pull off

00:17:12.067 --> 00:17:13.967
the wrong proton. 

00:17:13.967 --> 00:17:18.433
In this case, the base can not
only pull off the proton, it 

00:17:18.433 --> 00:17:20.233
can also act as a nucleophile. 

00:17:20.233 --> 00:17:23.000
And what would it do as a
nucleophile? Jack? 

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.500
STUDENT: Attack the ester. 

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.500
PROFESSOR: Hydroxide would
attack the ester, right? 

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.567
OH minus would come on, -OEt
would come off, and 

00:17:32.567 --> 00:17:37.167
you would convert the ester to
an acid, which would react 

00:17:37.167 --> 00:17:39.700
with the strong base, hydroxide,
and that would be 

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.567
the end of the line. 

00:17:40.567 --> 00:17:43.733
Because you don't have this
really super strong base that 

00:17:43.733 --> 00:17:44.967
could pull off two protons. 

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:51.633
But if you use ethoxide and it
attacks here, who cares? 

00:17:51.633 --> 00:17:54.500
One or the other the other
ethoxides is going to come off,

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.533
and you're back where you
started again. 

00:17:56.533 --> 00:17:56.767
Right? 

00:17:56.767 --> 00:17:58.700
So then it's possible to wait
until you 

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.733
pull that proton off. 

00:18:00.733 --> 00:18:01.067
OK. 

00:18:01.067 --> 00:18:04.933
So that compound is a
beta-ketoester. 

00:18:04.933 --> 00:18:06.933
It's got a ketone in the second
carbon 

00:18:06.933 --> 00:18:08.400
from the ester group. 

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:08.667
OK. 

00:18:08.667 --> 00:18:13.200
So you make the anion and react
it with an R with a leaving 

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.700
group, and now you treat it with
hydroxide. 

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:16.967
Right? 

00:18:16.967 --> 00:18:19.567
Because what you were really
after was getting this acid 

00:18:19.567 --> 00:18:23.333
with an R group on it. 

00:18:23.333 --> 00:18:26.867
But you don't use OH minus for
that. 

00:18:26.867 --> 00:18:30.867
Or you could use two esters to
make the thing acidic. 

00:18:30.867 --> 00:18:34.300
Do exactly the same stuff and
get the R on, now with two 

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.733
acid groups. 

00:18:35.733 --> 00:18:39.400
And of course, it would be
possible to do it a second 

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:44.267
time, and put a second R group
on while it's still an ester, 

00:18:44.267 --> 00:18:46.367
before you add the hydroxide. 

00:18:46.367 --> 00:18:46.667
OK. 

00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:51.567
So you can put alkyl groups on
these beta-ketoesters or 

00:18:51.567 --> 00:18:52.700
malonic ester. 

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:57.900
The CH2 with two carboxylate
groups on it is malonic acid. 

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.833
OK. 

00:18:58.833 --> 00:19:00.400
Now, you might want those
compounds. 

00:19:03.067 --> 00:19:07.433
Or we already, in fact, saw
using cyanoacetic ester. 

00:19:07.433 --> 00:19:09.533
You remember when we saw that? 

00:19:09.533 --> 00:19:12.733
We used it where R was this, R
with the leaving group. 

00:19:12.733 --> 00:19:15.233
It was the Mitsunobu procedure
that we went through and 

00:19:15.233 --> 00:19:21.167
showed that that also can
hydrolize the CN group, the 

00:19:21.167 --> 00:19:24.367
nitrile as well, to give a
second carboxylate groups. 

00:19:24.367 --> 00:19:27.133
But mostly, people aren't after
this. 

00:19:27.133 --> 00:19:32.733
What they're after is
protonating those to give the 

00:19:32.733 --> 00:19:38.267
beta-keto acid or the malonic
acid. 

00:19:38.267 --> 00:19:39.567
Why did I draw it that way? 

00:19:39.567 --> 00:19:40.833
Do you remember? 

00:19:44.533 --> 00:19:47.433
STUDENT: Because in that
structure the H is shared. 

00:19:47.433 --> 00:19:47.667
PROFESSOR: Pardon me? 

00:19:47.667 --> 00:19:48.300
I can't hear well. 

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.533
STUDENT: The H is somewhat
shared between the two Os. 

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:51.800
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.233
The H, of course, would be
hydrogen bonded to this 

00:19:54.233 --> 00:19:56.700
oxygen, but it can do more than
that. 

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.200
Remember from when we were
talking about 

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.867
the Mitsunobu reaction? 

00:19:59.867 --> 00:20:04.333
We can do this, which results in
decarboxylation 

00:20:04.333 --> 00:20:06.367
when we heat it. 

00:20:06.367 --> 00:20:09.767
And those are enols, which of
course can isomerize to the 

00:20:09.767 --> 00:20:13.433
related ketone, or on the second
case, into an acid. 

00:20:13.433 --> 00:20:18.100
So the real purpose of using
this beta-ketoester or the 

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.900
malonic ester is to put the R
group on, and 

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.467
then get these compounds. 

00:20:23.467 --> 00:20:26.300
So it's another way of getting
to what was effectively that 

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.700
enolate, except having the
second carbonyl on made it 

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.600
easier to get. 

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.400
You didn't need to use those
really strong basis. 

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:38.100
So you can you can synthesize an
alkylated acid or an 

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:44.800
alkylated ketone, alkylated in
the alpha position, by using 

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:49.100
these dicarbonyl compounds. 

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:53.300
The one on the top is called
acetoacetic ester synthesis. 

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:58.800
Because when this was still an
ester here, this was CH3 

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.833
acetoacetic acid. 

00:21:02.833 --> 00:21:06.633
So it goes by way of that to get
the ketone. 

00:21:06.633 --> 00:21:09.767
Or this one, as we said, was
malonic ester that we started 

00:21:09.767 --> 00:21:11.000
with to get the acid. 

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.800
Notice that these are ways of
adding to 

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.467
the R group two carbons. 

00:21:19.467 --> 00:21:20.867
Either with a ketone-- 

00:21:20.867 --> 00:21:22.533
I mean, it would be another
carbon, of course, if it were 

00:21:22.533 --> 00:21:25.800
a ketone-- or two carbons here
to make an acid. 

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.333
And so when one's thinking about
synthesis, you try to 

00:21:28.333 --> 00:21:30.767
think about how to put more
carbons on. 

00:21:30.767 --> 00:21:34.600
Remember the Arndt-Eistert
procedure, we talked about 

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:39.767
with diazomethane, or cyanide,
displacing chlorine from an R 

00:21:39.767 --> 00:21:43.267
group, or making a Grignard out
of the alkyl halide, and 

00:21:43.267 --> 00:21:44.833
then adding CO2? 

00:21:44.833 --> 00:21:47.467
Those all add one carbon to the
chain. 

00:21:47.467 --> 00:21:51.667
But this thing adds two carbons,
at least, or more, in 

00:21:51.667 --> 00:21:54.267
the case of this, when you have
an R group there. 

00:21:54.267 --> 00:21:59.267
And remember adding a
nucleophile to open an epoxide 

00:21:59.267 --> 00:22:00.967
also adds two carbon. 

00:22:00.967 --> 00:22:04.900
So if you're in the business of
organic synthesis, these 

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.267
things become second nature. 

00:22:06.267 --> 00:22:08.967
I need to add this, aha, I would
use that reagent or that 

00:22:08.967 --> 00:22:11.667
reagent or that reagent. 

00:22:11.667 --> 00:22:12.033
OK. 

00:22:12.033 --> 00:22:15.700
Then one of the most important
reactions is the aldol 

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:16.967
condensation. 

00:22:21.767 --> 00:22:26.133
It was discovered first with
acetaldehyde, which, treated 

00:22:26.133 --> 00:22:31.233
with base, makes the enolate. 

00:22:31.233 --> 00:22:32.733
But it can react with itself. 

00:22:37.467 --> 00:22:41.733
And then when you protonate the
O minus, you get this 

00:22:41.733 --> 00:22:44.367
compound, which, in the case of
acetaldehyde, this 

00:22:44.367 --> 00:22:47.433
particular one with a methyl
group here and a CH2 group 

00:22:47.433 --> 00:22:50.167
here, has the name aldol. 

00:22:50.167 --> 00:22:52.733
So this is called the aldol
reaction. 

00:22:52.733 --> 00:22:54.133
It makes aldol. 

00:22:54.133 --> 00:22:58.600
But you can make it with other
groups here as well, not just 

00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.667
with the methyl group. 

00:22:59.667 --> 00:23:03.233
And so generically they're
called aldols. 

00:23:03.233 --> 00:23:07.200
Obviously the name is aldehyde
and alcohol, aldol. 

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.533
But it can be dehydrated. 

00:23:13.667 --> 00:23:16.533
Lose the OH and an H down here
to give 

00:23:16.533 --> 00:23:19.800
the unsaturated aldehyde. 

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:28.167
Now an aldol is a
beta-hydroxyaldehyde. 

00:23:28.167 --> 00:23:32.133
And this is an alpha,
beta-unsaturated aldehyde. 

00:23:32.133 --> 00:23:35.067
So these are things that when
you're looking at something 

00:23:35.067 --> 00:23:39.100
you want to make, and you see,
aha, it's a beta-hydroxycarbonyl

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:43.567
compound, or it's an alpha,
beta-unsaturated 

00:23:43.567 --> 00:23:48.667
carbonyl compound, you think,
the aldol reaction. 

00:23:48.667 --> 00:23:51.900
If I assigned you a zillion
problems to do that, that 

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.833
would become second nature to
you. 

00:23:53.833 --> 00:23:57.100
If it turns out that that's
important to you, you will do 

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.100
a lot of problems with it, and
it will become 

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.667
second nature to you. 

00:24:00.667 --> 00:24:04.400
Now, I've shown it here
base-catalyzed, but it can be 

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:08.133
acid-catalyzed as well, and I
would expect you to be able to 

00:24:08.133 --> 00:24:09.633
figure out how the mechanism
would 

00:24:09.633 --> 00:24:12.467
work with acid catalysis. 

00:24:12.467 --> 00:24:15.667
Now, the equilibrium for this is
favorable, because this 

00:24:15.667 --> 00:24:18.700
isn't very crowded with H and H
here, and Hs is 

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.367
down here, and H here. 

00:24:21.367 --> 00:24:26.167
But if you start with a ketone
instead of an aldehyde, then 

00:24:26.167 --> 00:24:29.100
the product is more crowded and
less stable. 

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:33.267
So if you start with acetone
instead, and make the anion, 

00:24:33.267 --> 00:24:38.033
and try to do this reaction, and
make the beta-hydroxyketone 

00:24:38.033 --> 00:24:43.333
now, you find that the
equilibrium is unfavorable. 

00:24:43.333 --> 00:24:46.767
So you'd like to figure some
trick, if that's the compound 

00:24:46.767 --> 00:24:49.767
you want, that would allow you
to get over there. 

00:24:49.767 --> 00:24:54.600
One way is not to start with the
ketone, but to start with 

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.733
the enolate, so you're much
higher in energy. 

00:24:57.733 --> 00:25:00.400
So these things we talked about
before, about using 

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:04.667
really strong bases to preform
the anion, those 

00:25:04.667 --> 00:25:05.967
are ways to do this. 

00:25:05.967 --> 00:25:08.633
But if you want to deal just
with hydroxide, 

00:25:08.633 --> 00:25:10.467
there's a way to do it. 

00:25:10.467 --> 00:25:13.367
Now, we already went through the
demonstration of showing 

00:25:13.367 --> 00:25:16.833
how you make tea by pouring hot
water through a 

00:25:16.833 --> 00:25:18.400
tea bag in a funnel. 

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.367
But a much more efficient way is
to 

00:25:20.367 --> 00:25:22.667
use this Soxhlet extractor. 

00:25:22.667 --> 00:25:25.967
So the extractor looks like this
you boil liquid down 

00:25:25.967 --> 00:25:28.967
below, and you condense it up
above, and it drips down into 

00:25:28.967 --> 00:25:32.767
a paper cup that's holding the
tea or whatever it is. 

00:25:32.767 --> 00:25:36.067
And it begins to rise up, and
when it gets up to the top and 

00:25:36.067 --> 00:25:39.967
finally goes over the top, it
drains down, and then the 

00:25:39.967 --> 00:25:42.567
whole cycle starts over again. 

00:25:42.567 --> 00:25:44.867
So that's a much more efficient
way to do-- 

00:25:44.867 --> 00:25:46.667
to extract to make tea. 

00:25:46.667 --> 00:25:51.400
But it's also a way to make
aldol because of what you put 

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.367
in the cup. 

00:25:53.367 --> 00:25:55.500
So the liquid you're going to
use is acetone. 

00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:00.167
The liquid is acetone, 

00:26:00.167 --> 00:26:04.433
so it's distilling up, sitting
there for a while, and then 

00:26:04.433 --> 00:26:07.967
draining back, and distilling up
again. 

00:26:07.967 --> 00:26:15.033
Now, remember that it takes a
catalyst to make the aldol. 

00:26:15.033 --> 00:26:18.267
A base is what we've shown here.

00:26:18.267 --> 00:26:22.733
So suppose you had a base that
was only in the cup. 

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.767
Then the acetone will come and
sit in the cup and reach 

00:26:29.767 --> 00:26:32.100
equilibrium, if it's sitting
there for a while with the 

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.267
base, which has just a little
bit of the aldol in it, 

00:26:35.267 --> 00:26:39.167
because the equilibrium lies to
the left. 

00:26:39.167 --> 00:26:42.867
But then it drains down into the
pot, where there's no 

00:26:42.867 --> 00:26:47.400
base, so it can't go back again.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.867
But the dimer, of course, is
much heavier than 

00:26:49.867 --> 00:26:51.233
the starting material. 

00:26:51.233 --> 00:26:52.633
So it doesn't distill. 

00:26:52.633 --> 00:26:56.433
The acetone goes back up, drips
through again, makes a 

00:26:56.433 --> 00:26:59.133
little bit more, it drains in,
up a little more, a little 

00:26:59.133 --> 00:27:00.367
more, a little more. 

00:27:00.367 --> 00:27:05.633
So all you have to do is put in
that cup up above a base 

00:27:05.633 --> 00:27:09.967
which is not soluble in acetone.

00:27:09.967 --> 00:27:12.067
Barium hydroxide is such a
thing. 

00:27:12.067 --> 00:27:16.833
So that's a really fancy way to
make an aldol when it was 

00:27:16.833 --> 00:27:18.767
unfavorable. 

00:27:18.767 --> 00:27:21.733
Using a Soxhlet extractor. 

00:27:21.733 --> 00:27:22.367
OK. 

00:27:22.367 --> 00:27:26.433
Now it's possible to do a
crossed aldol condensation 

00:27:26.433 --> 00:27:31.700
where the enolate comes from one
carbonyl compound, and the 

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.767
carbonyl that gets attacked
comes from another one. 

00:27:34.767 --> 00:27:37.700
In particular, suppose you start
with what's called 

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.767
acetophenone. 

00:27:38.767 --> 00:27:41.233
It's a methyl-phenyl ketone. 

00:27:41.233 --> 00:27:43.000
Make its anion. 

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.467
And it attacks-- 

00:27:44.467 --> 00:27:48.633
if it were to attack, itself,
with methyl and phenyl, the 

00:27:48.633 --> 00:27:50.733
equilibrium would be very
unfavorable. 

00:27:50.733 --> 00:27:54.800
It would be way too crowded,
right? 

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.167
So this one won't work. 

00:27:56.167 --> 00:27:58.333
That's an unfavorable
equilibrium. 

00:27:58.333 --> 00:28:02.467
But suppose instead you use
benzaldehyde. 

00:28:02.467 --> 00:28:05.267
Now it's not hindered because
it's an aldehyde. 

00:28:05.267 --> 00:28:08.467
So you can make the product with
benzene here, benzene 

00:28:08.467 --> 00:28:12.667
here, and H here by this crossed
two different 

00:28:12.667 --> 00:28:16.433
reagents, this one and this one,
aldol condensation. 

00:28:16.433 --> 00:28:20.067
Now, it's clear that this one is
not going to react with 

00:28:20.067 --> 00:28:22.667
itself, with its own ketone,
because the product will be 

00:28:22.667 --> 00:28:23.833
too hindered. 

00:28:23.833 --> 00:28:27.200
But why won't the enolate of
that react with itself? 

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.633
It would be much less hindered.

00:28:29.633 --> 00:28:30.867
This is a trick question. 

00:28:34.167 --> 00:28:39.400
Why doesn't the enolate of this
carbonyl compound react 

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.200
with the aldehyde? Ellen, 

00:28:54.667 --> 00:28:56.500
what would the enolate of this
be? 

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:57.800
How do you make an enolate? 

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:02.133
STUDENT: Take off the H. 

00:29:02.133 --> 00:29:03.700
PROFESSOR: Where do you take the
H from? 

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:08.333
STUDENT: Umm. 

00:29:08.333 --> 00:29:12.333
PROFESSOR: From the carbon
that's adjacent to the carbonyl.

00:29:12.333 --> 00:29:12.633
Right? 

00:29:12.633 --> 00:29:14.767
So that the pi star or the
carbonyl will 

00:29:14.767 --> 00:29:16.767
stabilize the anion. 

00:29:16.767 --> 00:29:19.300
So what's the story here? 

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.300
STUDENT: Oh, there's
no H there.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.767
PROFESSOR: There isn't any. 

00:29:21.767 --> 00:29:22.833
It's a benzene ring. 

00:29:22.833 --> 00:29:25.433
There's no hydrogen on that
carbon. 

00:29:25.433 --> 00:29:28.033
So this can't form an enolate,
and this 

00:29:28.033 --> 00:29:29.933
can't react with itself. 

00:29:29.933 --> 00:29:34.700
So they cross over without
complication. 

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.533
So that one can't form an
enolate. 

00:29:36.533 --> 00:29:39.100
And you can then lose water to
make the alpha beta 

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.433
unsaturated ketone. 

00:29:41.433 --> 00:29:45.733
Now I'll just go through this,
which I did on the board last 

00:29:45.733 --> 00:29:47.700
year and took a picture of. 

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.467
This is the compound we just
made on the previous slide. 

00:29:51.467 --> 00:29:54.233
It's an alpha, beta-unsaturated
ketone. 

00:29:54.233 --> 00:29:58.133
And it undergoes what's called
conjugate addition. 

00:29:58.133 --> 00:30:02.400
That is, you expect a
nucleophile to react with the 

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.333
carbonyl carbon, the pi star. 

00:30:05.333 --> 00:30:08.833
But if you have a situation like
this, cyanide could react 

00:30:08.833 --> 00:30:12.467
not only there, but also here. 

00:30:12.467 --> 00:30:15.600
And if it reacts here, and then
you put on a 

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:19.467
proton on the O... 

00:30:19.467 --> 00:30:22.833
you'd have the enolate anion
once the cyanide is attacked 

00:30:22.833 --> 00:30:24.900
up at the top left here. 

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.667
So there's the charge here,
charge here, 

00:30:27.667 --> 00:30:30.500
So you could put the proton
either place. 

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.033
The more stable place to put the
proton is down here, so 

00:30:34.033 --> 00:30:37.133
you have a carbon oxygen double
bond, rather than to 

00:30:37.133 --> 00:30:39.733
put it on the oxygen, so you
have an enol. 

00:30:39.733 --> 00:30:42.833
We know that carbonyls are more
stable than enols. 

00:30:42.833 --> 00:30:45.233
So this is the product you get
from that. 

00:30:45.233 --> 00:30:49.400
And I think it's safest to call
it conjugate addition, 

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.733
because you add to a double bond
that cyanide would not 

00:30:52.733 --> 00:30:54.233
normally add to. 

00:30:54.233 --> 00:30:57.400
Remember, alkenes are usually
attacked by electrophiles, not 

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.633
nucleophiles. 

00:30:58.633 --> 00:31:01.567
But this one is special, because
adding here, you 

00:31:01.567 --> 00:31:04.433
generate a stable anion, the
enolate. 

00:31:04.433 --> 00:31:04.733
OK. 

00:31:04.733 --> 00:31:07.400
So that's called conjugate
addition. 

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.867
Or sometimes it's called 1,
4-addition. 

00:31:10.867 --> 00:31:14.000
So here's the one, two, three,
four, position. 

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.933
You add a hydrogen there and
cyanide here, that would be 

00:31:17.933 --> 00:31:20.500
1,4-addition to the thing. 

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.567
The product, of course, would be
an enolate, but the enolate 

00:31:23.567 --> 00:31:24.833
will become a ketone. 

00:31:24.833 --> 00:31:28.867
So that's just the name that's
given this 1, 4-addition. 

00:31:28.867 --> 00:31:31.367
But conjugate, I think, is
better. 

00:31:31.367 --> 00:31:32.100
OK. 

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:36.233
Now, if you react with the
Grignard reagent,

00:31:36.233 --> 00:31:38.233
phenylmagnesium  bromide,

00:31:38.233 --> 00:31:40.100
it does the same 
thing cyanide does. 

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.100
It undergoes conjugate addition,
and you get a 96% 

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.733
yield of this. 

00:31:45.733 --> 00:31:51.367
And if you use copper, it turns
out that that sometimes 

00:31:51.367 --> 00:31:55.667
helps to get conjugate addition,
if you add it. 

00:31:55.667 --> 00:31:58.900
But if you use, instead of
phenylmagnesium bromide, 

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:02.900
phenyllithium, then it doesn't
do the 1, 4-, or the 

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.267
conjugate addition. 

00:32:04.267 --> 00:32:06.833
It adds, as you would naively
have expected, to 

00:32:06.833 --> 00:32:09.000
the carbonyl group. 

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.333
So obviously, there's a lot of
subtlety involved here, and a 

00:32:12.333 --> 00:32:13.400
lot of lore. 

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.467
I would certainly not have
expected you to know-- 

00:32:17.467 --> 00:32:21.067
I would expect you to know that
you can add here, and 

00:32:21.067 --> 00:32:23.433
having thought about it a little
bit, I would expect you 

00:32:23.433 --> 00:32:25.400
to think that you can add here.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.867
But as to which way it goes, and
why a Grignard reagent 

00:32:28.867 --> 00:32:33.100
goes here, and why copper helps
it, while phenyllithium 

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.267
goes here-- 

00:32:34.267 --> 00:32:36.667
that, I wouldn't expect you to
know. 

00:32:36.667 --> 00:32:39.667
That's the lore that comes from
being in 

00:32:39.667 --> 00:32:40.900
the business a while. 

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.600
But when you've been around, you
know what to do. 

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.800
You know to throw copper in, if
this is the kind 

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.667
of product you want. 

00:32:46.667 --> 00:32:47.033
OK. 

00:32:47.033 --> 00:32:50.967
And the same kind of thing
happens with hydride addition. 

00:32:50.967 --> 00:32:54.967
So if you have this
cyclohexenone, and reduce it 

00:32:54.967 --> 00:32:58.167
with lithium aluminum hydride,
the hydride does what you 

00:32:58.167 --> 00:32:59.500
expect it to do. 

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.700
It adds to the carbon of the
carbonyl, and you get this 

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.667
unsaturated alcohol. 

00:33:04.667 --> 00:33:09.033
cyclohexenol, 97% yield. 

00:33:09.033 --> 00:33:12.900
But if you use a different
source of hydride, the BH4 

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:19.867
minus instead of AlH4 minus,
then you get only a 59% yield 

00:33:19.867 --> 00:33:25.433
of this product, and you get
41%, the rest of it is the 

00:33:25.433 --> 00:33:28.133
material that's lost the double
bond. 

00:33:28.133 --> 00:33:31.600
So the double bond has been
reduced, too. 

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:36.900
Now, BH3, remember, adds to
double bonds. 

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.133
But BH4 minus doesn't. 

00:33:39.133 --> 00:33:43.000
And when BH3 three adds, it adds
an H, and also the boron, 

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.867
and that's the way you get an
alcohol, remember, the 

00:33:44.867 --> 00:33:47.200
hydroboration/oxidation. 

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.233
But BH4 minus is different. 

00:33:49.233 --> 00:33:51.700
It doesn't react with double
bonds. 

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:55.700
And if you take this material
and react it with sodium 

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.100
borohydride, it doesn't do that.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.167
So that's not where this came
from. 

00:34:01.167 --> 00:34:03.433
Where it came from was having
the 

00:34:03.433 --> 00:34:05.933
first addition be conjugate. 

00:34:05.933 --> 00:34:09.933
So hydride added to this
position the end of the double 

00:34:09.933 --> 00:34:13.167
bond that's conjugated with the
carbonyl, as in the top 

00:34:13.167 --> 00:34:14.433
left there. 

00:34:14.433 --> 00:34:19.267
That made this enolate, which
then got protonated in this 

00:34:19.267 --> 00:34:24.200
position to give them the ketone
instead of the enol. 

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.467
And now that carbonyl can be
reduced by borohydride, the 

00:34:27.467 --> 00:34:29.433
same way this one could at the
beginning, 

00:34:29.433 --> 00:34:31.633
and now you get the 41% of that.

00:34:31.633 --> 00:34:35.933
So you must initially have
gotten almost equal amounts of 

00:34:35.933 --> 00:34:40.200
reduction of the carbonyl group
directly by 1, 2-addition 

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:45.100
and conjugate addition, 41%
conjugate addition, which then 

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.067
led to that. 

00:34:46.067 --> 00:34:47.767
So again, this is lore. 

00:34:47.767 --> 00:34:51.667
And if we drilled you on that,
you would know something. 

00:34:51.667 --> 00:34:55.067
You would be able to have quick
recall of it. 

00:34:55.067 --> 00:34:57.967
Having seen it, I expect you to
recognize things like that. 

00:34:57.967 --> 00:35:01.567
But I don't expect you to know
all the details. 

00:35:01.567 --> 00:35:05.267
In fact, I think no one knows
all the details. 

00:35:05.267 --> 00:35:08.833
This is all sensitive to what
temperature, exactly what 

00:35:08.833 --> 00:35:10.800
salts you use, what solvent and
so on. 

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.300
So it's a complicated thing. 

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.900
Or adding the copper. 

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:15.867
OK. 

00:35:15.867 --> 00:35:19.067
Now a very interesting reaction
is called the 

00:35:19.067 --> 00:35:21.100
Robinson annulation. 

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.700
Annulation means making a ring.

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:27.133
And this was invented in 1935,
and here's the beginning of 

00:35:27.133 --> 00:35:30.233
the paper where it was invented
by Rapson, a graduate 

00:35:30.233 --> 00:35:34.067
student, and Sir Robert
Robinson, who got the Nobel 

00:35:34.067 --> 00:35:37.800
Prize for synthetic organic
chemistry. 

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.467
So it's experiments on the
synthesis of substances 

00:35:41.467 --> 00:35:43.500
related to sterols. 

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.100
So you remember steroids, these
hormones, are 

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.367
six-membered ring, six-membered
ring, 

00:35:48.367 --> 00:35:51.333
six-membered ring, five-membered
ring, with 

00:35:51.333 --> 00:35:54.233
various lettuce hanging around
it. 

00:35:54.233 --> 00:35:55.933
So there are lots of these
different things. 

00:35:55.933 --> 00:36:01.733
And the 1930s through the 1950s
and '60s was the golden 

00:36:01.733 --> 00:36:03.833
age of steroid chemistry. 

00:36:03.833 --> 00:36:07.733
And remember, that was the basis
on which conformational 

00:36:07.733 --> 00:36:09.200
analysis was invented. 

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:13.800
In 1958, Barton, who was working
in this field, started 

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.767
looking at which side, axial,
equatorial and all that, that 

00:36:16.767 --> 00:36:20.133
was all done in the context of
steroids. 

00:36:20.133 --> 00:36:23.700
But what Robinson says here is,
"The methods for synthesis 

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.200
of 1-5 diketones"-- 

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.933
So here's a ketone. 

00:36:27.933 --> 00:36:30.267
One, two, three, four, five. 

00:36:30.267 --> 00:36:33.333
So a 1-5 diketone. 

00:36:33.333 --> 00:36:35.600
"The methods for synthesis of 1
5-diketones have been 

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.433
explored in this laboratory for
two reasons. 

00:36:38.433 --> 00:36:41.900
One, it was thought that
pinacols such as (I) might 

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:46.033
furnish the characteristic
angle-methyl ketone group (II)

00:36:46.067 --> 00:36:47.167
of estrone." 

00:36:47.167 --> 00:36:51.833
So estrone is a female hormone,
right? 

00:36:51.833 --> 00:36:55.333
And it has that five-membered
ring up in the top-right, 

00:36:55.333 --> 00:37:00.467
has a ketone there, and what's
called an angular methyl group 

00:37:00.467 --> 00:37:01.800
adjacent to it. 

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.533
So how are you going to
synthesize that? 

00:37:04.533 --> 00:37:10.333
So he thought that that could
come from this via a pinacol 

00:37:10.333 --> 00:37:11.167
rearrangement. 

00:37:11.167 --> 00:37:13.533
We talked about the pinacol
rearrangement. 

00:37:13.533 --> 00:37:16.300
Remember, what's going to happen
is you would protonate 

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:20.967
here, lose water, cation,
methide shift. 

00:37:20.967 --> 00:37:22.900
So now you've got the methyl
there from this 

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.233
five-membered ring. 

00:37:24.233 --> 00:37:28.367
So you need that compound if you
want to be able to 

00:37:28.367 --> 00:37:29.167
make it that way. 

00:37:29.167 --> 00:37:31.000
Where do you get a pinacol? 

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.433
You get it from pinacol
reduction. 

00:37:34.433 --> 00:37:37.333
So you would get it from this
forming the bond across there. 

00:37:37.333 --> 00:37:40.133
And we talked about the pinacol
reduction, where you 

00:37:40.133 --> 00:37:44.000
put an electron on here, an
electron on here, the two free 

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:50.133
radicals couple, and then you
have O minus, C-C bond, O minus.

00:37:50.133 --> 00:37:52.967
And they get protonated and give
the pinacol. 

00:37:52.967 --> 00:37:53.300
OK. 

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.033
So that would be the pinacol
reduction. 

00:37:55.033 --> 00:37:58.667
So that was what he was hoping
is a way to try to make this 

00:37:58.667 --> 00:38:01.867
five-membered ring with that
methyl group, which is hard to 

00:38:01.867 --> 00:38:03.133
put in there otherwise, 

00:38:06.567 --> 00:38:10.133
by intramolecular change," which
we would now call 

00:38:10.133 --> 00:38:11.567
rearrangement. 

00:38:11.567 --> 00:38:17.433
And a second reason was "the
diketones themselves, three, 

00:38:17.433 --> 00:38:21.967
might be dehydrated with the
formation of cyclcohexenones." 

00:38:21.967 --> 00:38:23.800
So you could make a six-membered
ring with a 

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.600
double bond carbonyl. 

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:29.467
Now, what do you notice about
that double bond? 

00:38:29.467 --> 00:38:33.267
He says you might be able to go
from here to here, so these 

00:38:33.267 --> 00:38:38.100
double shafted arrows are
thinking backwards. 

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:40.033
It's called retrosynthesis. 

00:38:40.033 --> 00:38:42.200
What could something come from?

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.433
The ultimate arrow will be this
going to this. 

00:38:44.433 --> 00:38:48.067
But when you see this, you think
of this. 

00:38:48.067 --> 00:38:49.300
Why? 

00:38:51.033 --> 00:38:54.433
Why, when you see this
functional group, do you think 

00:38:54.433 --> 00:38:55.667
of this diketone? 

00:38:59.133 --> 00:39:00.967
You look at that functional
group, and what 

00:39:00.967 --> 00:39:02.200
would you call it? 

00:39:06.533 --> 00:39:09.900
Can you give a name to that?
Kate, can you think of any names

00:39:09.933 --> 00:39:12.267
for functional groups there? 

00:39:12.267 --> 00:39:15.333
What's this functional group,
the C=O? 

00:39:15.333 --> 00:39:16.000
STUDENT: Ketone.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:16.900
PROFESSOR: Ketone. 

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.133
And this one? 

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.200
STUDENT: An alkene.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.067
PROFESSOR: An alkene. 

00:39:21.067 --> 00:39:24.633
So you could call it an eneone.

00:39:24.633 --> 00:39:25.367
Right? 

00:39:25.367 --> 00:39:28.433
But then you wouldn't know where
the ene is. 

00:39:28.433 --> 00:39:31.533
So you have to say where the ene
is relative to the ketone 

00:39:31.533 --> 00:39:33.333
to get that functional group to
know that they're 

00:39:33.333 --> 00:39:34.533
conjugated. 

00:39:34.533 --> 00:39:39.133
So if you start with the ketone,
it's the alpha and 

00:39:39.133 --> 00:39:41.367
then the beta position. 

00:39:41.367 --> 00:39:46.867
So it's an alpha beta
unsaturated ketone. 

00:39:46.867 --> 00:39:48.633
And there's another name for
alpha, 

00:39:48.633 --> 00:39:51.567
beta-unsaturated ketones. 

00:39:51.567 --> 00:39:53.933
They're the dehydration product
of aldols. 

00:39:56.833 --> 00:40:01.467
So the aldol reaction, where you
make an anion here, it 

00:40:01.467 --> 00:40:05.100
attacks that carbonyl to make
OH, and then 

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.133
you dehydrate it-- 

00:40:06.133 --> 00:40:07.900
he says dehydrate it here-- 

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.367
lose the OH and an H here to
make the double bond. 

00:40:10.367 --> 00:40:12.200
So that's the reaction we just
talked about. 

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.467
The aldol reaction. 

00:40:16.133 --> 00:40:19.633
So then you need this compound.

00:40:19.633 --> 00:40:21.433
You need that diketone if you're
going to 

00:40:21.433 --> 00:40:22.233
make it that way. 

00:40:22.233 --> 00:40:23.733
And how will you make it? 

00:40:23.733 --> 00:40:28.033
You'll make it by forming the
red bond, attacking this 

00:40:28.033 --> 00:40:30.400
double bond here. 

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.800
What kind of reaction is that? 

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.900
Luke, you got an idea? 

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:40.467
If you made an anion here, that
would 

00:40:40.467 --> 00:40:43.233
be an enolate anion. 

00:40:43.233 --> 00:40:44.767
Pulled an H off there. 

00:40:44.767 --> 00:40:45.600
OK? 

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.200
So you can make the anion here.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:51.367
And then you want to attack a
ketone, so you think of making 

00:40:51.367 --> 00:40:53.933
a bond from here to here. 

00:40:53.933 --> 00:40:56.867
But this is making a bond from
here to here. 

00:40:56.867 --> 00:40:58.200
Did you ever see anything like
that? 

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.433
About eight minutes ago, we
talked 

00:41:04.433 --> 00:41:07.033
about conjugate addition. 

00:41:07.033 --> 00:41:10.733
Addition to the double bond
adjacent to the carbonyl. 

00:41:10.733 --> 00:41:14.767
Because if the anion attacks
here, then you have a minus 

00:41:14.767 --> 00:41:17.533
charge on this carbon adjacent
to the carbonyl. 

00:41:17.533 --> 00:41:18.867
It's an enolate anion. 

00:41:18.867 --> 00:41:21.567
So this is an example of
conjugate addition. 

00:41:21.567 --> 00:41:24.267
So what you would need, then,
this would be conjugate 

00:41:24.267 --> 00:41:26.800
addition to this ketone. 

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.867
And that ketone, before you make
the red bond, is methyl 

00:41:30.867 --> 00:41:33.200
and a C=CH2, 

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.433
vinyl. 

00:41:34.433 --> 00:41:39.467
So that's methyl vinyl ketone,
which is a very important 

00:41:39.467 --> 00:41:45.067
reagent for making these
six-membered ring compounds. 

00:41:45.067 --> 00:41:51.867
So the idea of making this ring
compound by way of methyl 

00:41:51.867 --> 00:41:57.067
vinyl ketone, attacking a
ketone, is called the Robinson 

00:41:57.067 --> 00:41:58.433
annulation procedure. 

00:41:58.433 --> 00:42:01.667
The way of forming a ring. 

00:42:01.667 --> 00:42:08.433
So a base to make the enolate,
and then methyl vinyl ketone. 

00:42:08.433 --> 00:42:11.967
So it takes this into two
six-membered rings adjacent to 

00:42:11.967 --> 00:42:16.800
one another with a carbonyl down
here, which is just like 

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.300
what's in the bottom lefthand
corner of these steroids. 

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.267
Six-membered ring with an oxygen
pointing down that way 

00:42:23.267 --> 00:42:25.167
and another six-membered ring. 

00:42:25.167 --> 00:42:28.900
So the Robinson annulation is
just the ticket for forming 

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.567
this thing, and they often have
a methyl 

00:42:30.567 --> 00:42:32.667
group in that position. 

00:42:32.667 --> 00:42:37.900
So you see, these are the four
carbons that become these four 

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:39.533
carbons in the product. 

00:42:39.533 --> 00:42:44.533
So to do that, you'd need an
enolate at this position doing 

00:42:44.533 --> 00:42:46.733
a conjugate addition to attack
here. 

00:42:46.733 --> 00:42:49.367
So this carbon becomes that
carbon. 

00:42:49.367 --> 00:42:53.467
Then you form an anion here at
that position, 

00:42:53.467 --> 00:42:55.800
an enolate, it is. 

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.567
And beyond the carbonyl, there's
one more methyl group. 

00:42:58.567 --> 00:43:01.100
This one. 

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:05.200
But once you've got that, then
once you've got the methyl 

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:09.967
group here and still a ketone
here, then you can have the 

00:43:09.967 --> 00:43:14.567
anion of that methyl group, the
enolate, attack the 

00:43:14.567 --> 00:43:18.533
carbonyle, an aldol reaction,
dehydrate, and 

00:43:18.533 --> 00:43:19.433
you've got this thing. 

00:43:19.433 --> 00:43:23.500
So that all happens at once when
you use methyl vinyl 

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.767
ketone as the ketone. 

00:43:24.767 --> 00:43:27.433
Except you have to be sure that
you've got the right 

00:43:27.433 --> 00:43:31.033
anion here, that the anion is,
at that position, the enolate 

00:43:31.033 --> 00:43:33.900
that you're starting with, and
not at that position. 

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.467
And we'll address that on
Friday, how you make sure 

00:43:36.467 --> 00:43:39.767
you've got the right enolate. 

00:43:39.767 --> 00:43:43.300
And Woodward-- because on
Friday, we'll be talking about 

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:46.967
Woodward's synthesis of the
steroid cortozone, where he 

00:43:46.967 --> 00:43:48.733
used Robinson's method. 

00:43:48.733 --> 00:43:52.367
We showed this picture before
last semester, and they're not 

00:43:52.367 --> 00:43:54.600
acknowledging one another's
presence here. 

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:58.067
Both of them were quite... 

00:43:58.067 --> 00:44:01.667
Each of them, I'm sure, was
quite confident that he was 

00:44:01.667 --> 00:44:05.367
most important organic chemist
of the 20th century. 

00:44:05.367 --> 00:44:09.233
And what's especially
interesting is here You see 

00:44:09.233 --> 00:44:11.667
the double bond is not drawn,
but this is that 

00:44:11.667 --> 00:44:14.733
cyclohexenone, the product from
the Robinson annulation. 

00:44:17.333 --> 00:44:17.633
OK. 

00:44:17.633 --> 00:44:22.267
Then there's one called the
Claisen condensation, which is 

00:44:22.267 --> 00:44:23.533
now an ester. 

00:44:23.533 --> 00:44:25.300
But all these are the same. 

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:29.067
You make an enolate, and you
react here with itself. 

00:44:29.067 --> 00:44:32.400
So in fact, when I made these
slides, I could use exactly 

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.767
the same slide and just plug in
one group 

00:44:34.767 --> 00:44:36.167
different each time. 

00:44:36.167 --> 00:44:38.000
So as you look at these, you'll
be able to organize 

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.867
them clearly in your mind. 

00:44:39.867 --> 00:44:41.267
So here now is an ester. 

00:44:41.267 --> 00:44:43.767
Why do we use RO minus rather
than hydroxide? 

00:44:47.967 --> 00:44:50.867
Because we don't want to make
the acid. 

00:44:50.867 --> 00:44:53.800
We want to keep the ester. 

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.167
So we have RO minus, we talked
about that 

00:44:56.167 --> 00:44:58.433
before, make the enolate. 

00:44:58.433 --> 00:45:02.033
And now this one comes over and
gets attacked. 

00:45:02.033 --> 00:45:05.533
So it starts the same way an
aldol does, if the starting 

00:45:05.533 --> 00:45:09.467
material were an aldehyde or a
ketone. 

00:45:09.467 --> 00:45:15.233
But it's different because you
have a leaving group on here. 

00:45:15.233 --> 00:45:18.367
So when it comes back in, that
leaving group can leave. So 

00:45:18.367 --> 00:45:20.800
instead of getting an alcohol
from the group that gets 

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.767
attacked, you get a carbonyl
group. 

00:45:24.767 --> 00:45:27.467
So it's a beta-ketoester. 

00:45:27.467 --> 00:45:30.567
Instead of beta-hydroxy ketone,

00:45:30.567 --> 00:45:33.033
beta-hydroxy aldehyde-- 

00:45:33.033 --> 00:45:35.267
that's the aldol reaction-- 

00:45:35.267 --> 00:45:38.333
it's a beta-ketoester, because
you 

00:45:38.333 --> 00:45:39.667
had a leaving group. 

00:45:39.667 --> 00:45:41.700
So it's not an alcohol, right? 

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:46.667
Now again, this equilibrium is
unfavorable, if you have more 

00:45:46.667 --> 00:45:49.333
complicated groups on here. 

00:45:49.333 --> 00:45:54.500
But at first, it looked like the
alkoxide was catalytic. 

00:45:54.500 --> 00:46:01.333
We used it here to make the
enolate, but then we got it 

00:46:01.333 --> 00:46:04.000
back again here, so it looks
like a catalyst that just 

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.233
cycles around and around. 

00:46:05.233 --> 00:46:07.167
You don't need very much of it.

00:46:07.167 --> 00:46:11.300
But this beta-ketoester is quite
acidic. 

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:16.867
So it actually "eats up the
lye," as in saponification that

00:46:16.867 --> 00:46:19.900
we talked about last time. 

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.933
And that's good, because the
equilibrium here might have 

00:46:22.933 --> 00:46:24.200
been unfavorable. 

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:27.333
But once you do this very
exothermic reaction, taking up 

00:46:27.333 --> 00:46:29.300
one of those hydrogens, then the
reaction 

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:30.533
is favorable again. 

00:46:33.267 --> 00:46:38.167
Now here's nature's version of
the Claisen condensation. 

00:46:38.167 --> 00:46:39.933
They use the special ester. 

00:46:39.933 --> 00:46:42.467
Instead of oxygen, it's got
sulfur here. 

00:46:42.467 --> 00:46:43.967
But it does exactly the same
thing. 

00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:45.967
It makes the anion, it attacks,
you 

00:46:45.967 --> 00:46:47.967
get a beta-ketoester. 

00:46:47.967 --> 00:46:49.533
It's a thioester. 

00:46:49.533 --> 00:46:54.900
And coA is coenzyme A, so it's a
special R group that's 

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:57.267
attached to make it an ester. 

00:46:57.267 --> 00:47:00.267
If you're interested, that's the
R group. 

00:47:00.267 --> 00:47:04.200
There's the SH that's going to
be that thing there. 

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:08.567
But that will be for another
day. 

00:47:08.567 --> 00:47:13.133
So how does nature get around
the fact that this equilibrium 

00:47:13.133 --> 00:47:15.267
is unfavorable, that it would
come back? 

00:47:15.267 --> 00:47:17.300
It puts an extra CO2 in. 

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:20.967
So instead of starting with this
being CH3, it starts with 

00:47:20.967 --> 00:47:23.000
an extra CO2 group on it here. 

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.067
So it's a dicarbonyl compound. 

00:47:26.067 --> 00:47:29.000
Easier to form the anion. 

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.933
Now, you might think, if that's
a negative charge, it's 

00:47:30.933 --> 00:47:33.100
going to be hard to form the
anion. 

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:37.133
But in the enzyme where it's
held, this one is not ionized. 

00:47:37.133 --> 00:47:39.967
I'm not sure exactly how it's
tied up, but anyhow, it helps 

00:47:39.967 --> 00:47:43.033
make this one acidic, having the
carbonyl next door. 

00:47:43.033 --> 00:47:44.500
And then you get this product. 

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:48.200
So it's malonyl, not acetyl. 

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:52.433
And then the equilibrium is
driven by losing the CO2. 

00:47:52.433 --> 00:47:56.200
So that's how nature does
Claisen condensations. 

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.567
Why? 

00:47:57.567 --> 00:48:00.833
Because it wants to store
energy, right? 

00:48:00.833 --> 00:48:04.367
So notice it's put this acetyl
group on the 

00:48:04.367 --> 00:48:06.800
original acid, or ester. 

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.667
It's formed this new bond where
it attacked and had a 

00:48:10.667 --> 00:48:12.667
leaving group. 

00:48:12.667 --> 00:48:15.700
So then nature reduces it using
the reducing agent, 

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:18.567
NADH, that we talked about. 

00:48:18.567 --> 00:48:21.367
So it becomes an alcohol. 

00:48:21.367 --> 00:48:23.067
And then it dehydrates. 

00:48:23.067 --> 00:48:25.667
It's a beta hydroxy carbonyl
compound. 

00:48:25.667 --> 00:48:28.000
Just like aldols, it dehydrates.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.667
And then it gets reduced again
to put H2 in here. 

00:48:32.667 --> 00:48:34.067
So we have this product. 

00:48:34.067 --> 00:48:38.600
We started with having just one
methyl group with just two 

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:42.133
carbons here, and now we have
one, two, three, 

00:48:42.133 --> 00:48:43.767
four carbons there. 

00:48:43.767 --> 00:48:45.567
And notice what you can do. 

00:48:45.567 --> 00:48:52.667
You can take this ester and plug
it in up above, and put 

00:48:52.667 --> 00:48:58.700
another two carbons on when you
come around to get this. 

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:01.333
Then you can plug it in, put
another two carbons, another 

00:49:01.333 --> 00:49:02.300
two carbons. 

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:07.733
So you can make a long chain of
reduced carbons ending in 

00:49:07.733 --> 00:49:10.633
an acid, or an ester, to start
with. 

00:49:10.633 --> 00:49:13.267
So these are fatty acids. 

00:49:13.267 --> 00:49:16.167
That's how you store the
energy of fuel to burn, as 

00:49:16.167 --> 00:49:19.767
these successive CH2 groups that
can be oxidized. 

00:49:19.767 --> 00:49:24.067
But the fatty acids that occur
in nature are all even numbers 

00:49:24.067 --> 00:49:26.333
of carbon, not odd numbers. 

00:49:26.333 --> 00:49:29.067
Because it makes them this way,
and always adds two 

00:49:29.067 --> 00:49:30.800
carbons at a time to the chain.

00:49:36.067 --> 00:49:38.867
I'm going to say just two words
now-- 

00:49:38.867 --> 00:49:41.333
more than two, but not many more
than two-- 

00:49:41.333 --> 00:49:43.300
about carbohydrates. 

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.833
So carbohydrate was named early
on. 

00:49:45.833 --> 00:49:47.500
I was going to look it up and
find out. 

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:51.400
It must have been in the early
19th Century. 

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.667
Once they could analyze them and
see they were 

00:49:53.667 --> 00:49:57.233
CH2O taken n times. 

00:49:57.233 --> 00:49:58.433
So carbohydrates. 

00:49:58.433 --> 00:49:59.933
A hydrate of carbon. 

00:49:59.933 --> 00:50:00.733
Right? 

00:50:00.733 --> 00:50:05.067
Now, Couper in 1858 had the idea
of tetravalence. 

00:50:05.067 --> 00:50:08.167
And once you had that, a number
of sugars had been 

00:50:08.167 --> 00:50:11.700
observed, but no one had any
idea what structure was, so it 

00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.733
was hard to talk about them. 

00:50:13.733 --> 00:50:15.733
You could talk about some of
their properties, but not, 

00:50:15.733 --> 00:50:17.600
obviously, about their
structure. 

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:21.267
So if you have carbohydrate,
Couper would put two more 

00:50:21.267 --> 00:50:22.567
bonds on the carbon. 

00:50:22.567 --> 00:50:26.933
So you could make a chain of
these, say, six. 

00:50:26.933 --> 00:50:28.800
But this is unsatisfactory. 

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.867
You've got to do something with
those two 

00:50:31.867 --> 00:50:34.167
bonds on the end. 

00:50:34.167 --> 00:50:36.833
You could make a carbon ring, a
six-membered ring, 

00:50:36.833 --> 00:50:39.400
cyclohexane with OHs all around.

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:42.567
But that's not what you do. 

00:50:42.567 --> 00:50:46.067
What Couper did in his very
first paper, you remember, 

00:50:46.067 --> 00:50:50.100
about structure, he gave a
structure for glucose. 

00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:52.033
and the structure he gave was
this. 

00:50:52.033 --> 00:50:54.100
What did he do with the extra
bonds? 

00:50:57.167 --> 00:51:00.567
How did he modify this chain in
order to get his structure? 

00:51:04.333 --> 00:51:07.233
Well, of course, remember there
are double oxygens where 

00:51:07.233 --> 00:51:08.833
in fact there should be a single
oxygen. 

00:51:08.833 --> 00:51:10.033
That's because of the-- 

00:51:10.033 --> 00:51:11.267
But what else? 

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:19.900
He took water and put H on one
end OH on the other. 

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:21.867
And in fact, you can do that. 

00:51:21.867 --> 00:51:24.367
This is a gem-diol. 

00:51:24.367 --> 00:51:27.900
That's an aldehyde that's been
hydrated. 

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:29.900
That's one way to do it. 

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:34.100
Another way to do it is to
take-- 

00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:38.533
this is what got lost when my
computer crashed. 

00:51:38.533 --> 00:51:43.933
So this one, notice, took the
HOH that was here, took the Hs 

00:51:43.933 --> 00:51:48.100
away, put one H up here, the
other H down there. 

00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:51.833
And this one took the two Hs
away from this one, put one H 

00:51:51.833 --> 00:51:56.500
up there, the other H down
there. 

00:51:56.500 --> 00:52:00.967
So these, then, are sugars, but
who knows 

00:52:00.967 --> 00:52:02.233
which one is which?

00:52:08.133 --> 00:52:11.200
And this is a page from van 't
Hoff's-- 

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:12.467
that was 1858--

00:52:12.467 --> 00:52:15.067
1874, stereochemistry. 

00:52:15.067 --> 00:52:17.667
What makes things optically
active? 

00:52:17.667 --> 00:52:21.400
Van 't Hoff, in his 1874 paper,
says these compounds 

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.300
are optically active:

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:28.133
Glucose, levulose, lactose,
mannitol. 

00:52:28.133 --> 00:52:29.867
Because he's got four different
things on this 

00:52:29.867 --> 00:52:31.467
carbon, the four that are in the
middle 

00:52:31.467 --> 00:52:32.867
of the chain, right? 

00:52:32.867 --> 00:52:37.233
Or mannitol, the one where
you've added H to each end of 

00:52:37.233 --> 00:52:38.500
the aldehyde. 

00:52:40.133 --> 00:52:41.933
Then you still have these
things. 

00:52:41.933 --> 00:52:45.667
Or derivatives of mannitol, or
the diacid where you have an 

00:52:45.667 --> 00:52:47.500
acid at each end of the chain. 

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.667
All these things were optically
active, right? 

00:52:49.667 --> 00:52:50.400
That's part of this. 

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:54.000
So there were a number of sugars
known by that time. 

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.967
But the really fine work began
to be done in the 1880s by 

00:52:59.967 --> 00:53:03.467
Heinrich Kiliani and Emil
Fischer. 

00:53:03.467 --> 00:53:06.733
And that will be a treat for
next time.

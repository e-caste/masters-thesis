00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.506
Prof: We're going to
continue with the lecture on the

00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:08.570
Gospel of John that I talked
about last time.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.038
I want to finish up with some
of the material on John that I

00:00:12.038 --> 00:00:14.390
didn't get to as much as I'd
like to,

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.540
and then we're going to switch
to the letters of John--

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.307
1,2, and 3 John,
so we're going to do both of

00:00:18.307 --> 00:00:18.910
those things.
 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.035
Now, remember,
the rubric under which today's

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:26.439
lecture happens is not just the
Gospel of John and not just the

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.860
letters of John.
 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.169
As I've brought up several
times, the method that I'm

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.114
teaching you right now in this
class is the historical critical

00:00:35.114 --> 00:00:38.932
method as it was developed in
the twentieth century in Europe

00:00:38.932 --> 00:00:40.460
and North America.
 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.053
This means that we're not
reading these texts for just

00:00:44.053 --> 00:00:47.442
what the texts say about
theology or even the early

00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:50.305
church or doctrine,
or ethics or something like

00:00:50.305 --> 00:00:50.580
that.
 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.390
We're trying to read the text
in a way against the very

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.640
intention of the text.
 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.438
We're taking the text as being
something like a window that we

00:00:58.438 --> 00:01:00.929
can look through to try to
construct,

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.869
as best as we can guess at it,
what kind of social context,

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.530
what kind of political context,
what kind of church,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.037
what kind of social groups
produced these texts and found

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:14.110
them to be compelling,
found them to be believable.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.060
There are lots of other ways to
read this.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.167
Obviously the Gospel of John is
very important for Christian

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:19.560
doctrine.
 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.420
It's the most Christological of
the Gospels,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.310
it has the highest form of
Christology,

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.849
that is the Christology--it's
the most divine rather than

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:31.769
simply being human and so it's
very important for doctrine,

00:01:31.769 --> 00:01:33.030
and for theology, and for faith.
 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.152
What I'm doing right now is
just one particular way of

00:01:36.152 --> 00:01:39.141
reading,
which is reading this text as a

00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:41.598
clue,
as a series of clues and traces

00:01:41.598 --> 00:01:45.393
that we might use to reconstruct
what we think was going on in

00:01:45.393 --> 00:01:48.690
the first century with the
growth of Christianity.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.470
I'm trying to show you by this
that there are different kinds

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.879
of Christianity that grew up in
different places,

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:56.230
different geographical
settings, and different times.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.289
So what we call Johannine
Christianity is what we're going

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:00.468
to talk about today.
 

00:02:00.468 --> 00:02:02.817
And we're also--one of the
wonderful things about the John

00:02:02.817 --> 00:02:04.590
literature is that by having the
Gospel,

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.205
which is written at one time,
and then having 1 John which is

00:02:08.205 --> 00:02:11.218
the letter written after that
time we can tell,

00:02:11.218 --> 00:02:15.276
that shows us a development of
this form of Christianity and

00:02:15.276 --> 00:02:18.932
than by having 2 and 3 John,
which we believe were written

00:02:18.932 --> 00:02:22.300
still later than 1 John,
that gives us a third stage.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.718
In fact, what I'm going to be
talking about is three or four

00:02:25.718 --> 00:02:29.022
stages in the development of
Johannine Christianity as one

00:02:29.022 --> 00:02:31.400
branch of early Christian
literature.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.655
In order to do this--I talked
last time about how one of the

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:38.131
things going on in the Gospel of
John is Jesus and the Gospel of

00:02:38.131 --> 00:02:41.497
John seems to start off lots of
conversations and they lead to

00:02:41.497 --> 00:02:44.172
division,
so the causation of division is

00:02:44.172 --> 00:02:47.699
one of the themes of the Gospel
of John and to show that we're

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:50.360
going to walk through a couple
of chapters.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.440
First look at chapter 3,
this is the story of Nicodemus,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.210
so get your Bibles out and
follow along with me,

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.300
because we're going to look at
this in depth and then we're

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.598
going to look at chapter 8 a
bit,

00:03:00.598 --> 00:03:02.020
and then we're going to move
off.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.431
I said division is the issue,
so what we're going to talk

00:03:04.431 --> 00:03:05.810
about is what the division is.
 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.199
One of the ways that this
author does this is he sets up

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:15.150
Jesus in these dialogues that
don't actually work very well.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.909
Jesus is not good on
interpersonal communication in

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.490
the Gospel of John.
 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.060
I'm sorry to have to tell you
that.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.810
We'll talk about why that's the
case.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.935
Jesus talks in riddles,
so the question we're going to

00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:31.650
have is why does Jesus talk in
riddles in the Gospel of John?

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.878
What do we get out of that?
 

00:03:34.878 --> 00:03:39.720
Chapter 3, "There was a
Pharisee named Nicodemus,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.184
a leader of the Jews,
he came to Jesus by night and

00:03:42.184 --> 00:03:44.021
said to him"--
now by night,

00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:47.604
darkness is kind of a thematic
issue in the Gospel of John,

00:03:47.604 --> 00:03:48.160
right?
 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.348
Notice I'm not going to bring
up all these themes this time,

00:03:50.348 --> 00:03:53.335
but keep noticing these themes
that I talked about last time as

00:03:53.335 --> 00:03:55.310
they occur even in this little
passage.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.535
"Rabbi,
we know that you are a teacher

00:03:57.535 --> 00:04:00.568
who has come from God,
and no one else can do these

00:04:00.568 --> 00:04:03.990
signs that you do apart from the
presence of God."

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.658
Jesus answered him,
"Very truly I tell you,

00:04:06.658 --> 00:04:09.841
no one can see the kingdom of
God without being born from

00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:10.750
above."
 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.329
How the hell does that follow
from what Nicodemus just said?

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.122
He's gives Jesus a compliment,
"you're a teacher from

00:04:19.122 --> 00:04:21.180
God, no one else can do these
signs, ...

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.788
apart from the presence of
Godâ€¦,"

00:04:22.788 --> 00:04:23.992
Jesus says,
"No one can see the

00:04:23.992 --> 00:04:25.266
kingdom of"--
what is there,

00:04:25.266 --> 00:04:26.410
is there a thank you?
 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.009
Can Jesus say,
"You're smart"?

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.930
"You just got something
there"?

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.100
No, Jesus starts off changing
the subject.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.240
Jesus changes the subject in
the Gospel of John quite a lot.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.002
"No one can see the
Kingdom of God without being

00:04:43.002 --> 00:04:44.740
born from above."
 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.589
Now you're reading it in
English translation.

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:50.057
My text just said "from
above," does anybody's

00:04:50.057 --> 00:04:52.257
translation have something
different there besides

00:04:52.257 --> 00:04:53.470
"from above"?
 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.970
Student: 
&gt;

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.612
Prof: "Without
being born anew,"

00:04:57.612 --> 00:04:59.129
"again."
 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:01.845
The problem is the Greek
actually can be translated

00:05:01.845 --> 00:05:04.778
either "being born
again" or "being born

00:05:04.778 --> 00:05:07.221
all over again,"
or "being born from

00:05:07.221 --> 00:05:08.199
above."
 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:10.149
The same Greek word means both
things.

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:12.500
Now this is the one place,
basically,

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.338
in the Bible which born-again
kind of language comes out,

00:05:16.338 --> 00:05:18.774
so it's kind of ironic that
there's whole branches of

00:05:18.774 --> 00:05:21.442
American Christianity which base
their entire theology and

00:05:21.442 --> 00:05:24.278
ideology on the idea,
have you been born again?

00:05:24.278 --> 00:05:26.117
Because really it's just from
this passage,

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:28.480
the other Gospels don't talk
about being born again.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.800
It's a rather rare metaphor in
early Christianity.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.629
It comes from this chapter
right here,

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:36.892
and it comes from a Greek word
that could be just as easily

00:05:36.892 --> 00:05:40.098
translated "be born from
above" as "be born

00:05:40.098 --> 00:05:41.000
again."
 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.687
My English
translation--translators have

00:05:42.687 --> 00:05:45.206
decided to translated,
"from above,"

00:05:45.206 --> 00:05:48.767
but notice it's confusing for
the hearer because Nicodemus

00:05:48.767 --> 00:05:51.329
then answers as if he heard it
to be,

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:55.410
"being born again,"
so Nicodemus said to him,

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.660
"How can anyone be born
after having grown old?

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.238
Can one enter a second time
into the mother's womb and be

00:06:02.238 --> 00:06:03.069
born?"
 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:07.567
Jesus said, "Nicodemus I'm
speaking metaphorically and

00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:11.105
spiritually here,
you need to understand that I

00:06:11.105 --> 00:06:15.146
don't mean particularly that
someone has to be actually born

00:06:15.146 --> 00:06:18.160
physically from their mother
again."

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.720
No, Jesus doesn't say any of
that, right?

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.100
That's what Jesus should have
said,

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.605
probably, if Jesus really
wanted to communicate with

00:06:26.605 --> 00:06:28.600
Nicodemus,
but apparently,

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.853
in John, Jesus is not that
interested in communicating very

00:06:32.853 --> 00:06:36.300
directly with Nicodemus because
Jesus says,

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.684
"Truly I tell you,
no one can enter the Kingdom of

00:06:39.684 --> 00:06:42.879
God without being born of water
and spirit."

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:45.910
What the hell does that mean?
 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.416
"What is born of the flesh
is flesh, and what is born of

00:06:49.416 --> 00:06:50.759
the spirit is spirit.
 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:53.786
Do not be astonished that I
said to you, 'You must be born

00:06:53.786 --> 00:06:54.529
from above.'
 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:58.189
The wind blows where it
chooses, and you hear the sound

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:01.983
of it but you do not know where
it comes from or where it

00:07:01.983 --> 00:07:03.000
goes."
 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.990
What does that mean?
 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.458
Does it help you to know the
Greek word translated here

00:07:08.458 --> 00:07:11.411
"spirit"
is also the Greek word which

00:07:11.411 --> 00:07:14.110
can be translated as
"wind."

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.855
Notice that the Gospel of John
is playing with you with puns,

00:07:17.855 --> 00:07:20.540
there's already two puns in
this passage.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.870
One, does the Greek word--is
the Greek word "being born

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.750
again" or is it "born
from above"?

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.766
Well you're not told in the
text, in fact it sounds like it

00:07:29.766 --> 00:07:31.430
may mean a little bit of both.
 

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.478
Is this Greek word,
pneuma,

00:07:33.478 --> 00:07:37.329
is it supposed to represent the
spirit as a theological term or

00:07:37.329 --> 00:07:40.250
is it supposed to represent
breath or wind?

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.550
It seems to be doing double
duty.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.074
Anyway, with all that stuff
about wind blowing where it

00:07:46.074 --> 00:07:48.357
will,
so it is with everyone who is

00:07:48.357 --> 00:07:52.500
born of the spirit Nicodemus
tries one more time said to him,

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.100
"How can these things
be?"

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.286
In other words,
Jesus can you give me an

00:07:56.286 --> 00:07:58.699
explanation of what you're
talking about?

00:07:58.699 --> 00:08:00.310
It's not an unreasonable
request.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.690
Jesus answered,
"Are you a teacher of

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.480
Israel and you do not understand
these things?

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.060
[Well that's helpful.]
Truly I tell you.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.552
we speak of what we know and
testify to what we've seen,

00:08:12.552 --> 00:08:14.319
yet you do not receive our
testimony.

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:16.490
If I had told you about earthly
things and you do not believe,

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.589
how will you believe if I tell
you about heavenly things?

00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:20.716
No one has ascended into heaven
except the one who descended

00:08:20.716 --> 00:08:21.800
from heaven, the Son of Man.
 

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.769
And just as Moses lifted up the
servant in the wilderness,

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:25.560
so the Son of Man must be
lifted up,

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.230
that whoever believes in him
may have eternal life."

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:31.939
Well at this point Nicodemus
just gives up.

00:08:31.939 --> 00:08:33.995
We don't hear about Nicodemus
anymore in the story so

00:08:33.995 --> 00:08:36.089
apparently he's decided,
I can't get a straight answer

00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:36.879
out of this guy.
 

00:08:36.879 --> 00:08:40.533
Notice also how Jesus starts
off in a dialogical stance with

00:08:40.533 --> 00:08:43.320
Nicodemus but never answers his
questions,

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.110
and then Jesus almost gets kind
of,

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.740
well nasty, toward the end.
 

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.754
He kind of just almost insults
Nicodemus rather than just

00:08:50.754 --> 00:08:52.210
explaining what he means.
 

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.916
This is kind of the way Jesus
sometimes talks in the Gospel of

00:08:55.916 --> 00:08:58.590
John, and my question is going
to be, why?

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.730
Is Jesus just lacking in social
skills?

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:21.585
Look in 8:31,
another little interesting

00:09:21.585 --> 00:09:23.240
dialogue.
 

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.791
Jesus has been teaching and now
"Jesus said to the Jews who

00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:28.370
had believed in him."
 

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:32.039
Now notice the scene starts
out--often in the Gospel of John

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:35.711
the Jews are talked about as if
they're something other than

00:09:35.711 --> 00:09:36.519
Jesus is.
 

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:38.298
Of course Jesus is a Jew,
his disciples are Jews,

00:09:38.298 --> 00:09:41.139
they're all Jews in this story
but the term "the

00:09:41.139 --> 00:09:44.033
Jews" gets packed in the
Gospel of John with this

00:09:44.033 --> 00:09:47.035
otherness and this is a
reflection of the sectarianism I

00:09:47.035 --> 00:09:48.620
talked about last time.
 

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.304
Now notice Jesus is now
starting to talk to the Jews

00:09:51.304 --> 00:09:52.779
who believe in him.
 

00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:54.462
These are not the Jews who have
rejected him,

00:09:54.462 --> 00:09:56.759
that's very important to see at
this point in the chapter.

00:09:56.759 --> 00:09:58.490
These are the Jews who now
believe in him.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:01.394
"If you continue in my
word you are truly my disciples

00:10:01.394 --> 00:10:04.097
and you will know the truth and
the truth will make you

00:10:04.097 --> 00:10:04.850
free."
 

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.875
They answered him,
"We are the descendants of

00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:10.778
Abraham and have never been
slaves to anyone.

00:10:10.778 --> 00:10:14.210
What do you mean by saying you
will be made free?"

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.960
Jesus answered them,
"Well I was speaking

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.000
metaphorically.
 

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.136
I meant that,
let's say you're slaves to sin

00:10:21.136 --> 00:10:25.004
and, if you follow me,
then I will make you truly free

00:10:25.004 --> 00:10:27.850
in a spiritual sense,
I mean."

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.289
That's not what Jesus does,
right?

00:10:30.289 --> 00:10:32.818
All right 34:
Jesus answered them,

00:10:32.818 --> 00:10:35.498
"Very truly I tell you,
everyone who commits sin is a

00:10:35.498 --> 00:10:36.250
slave to sin.
 

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.528
The slave does not have a
permanent place in the

00:10:38.528 --> 00:10:39.110
household.
 

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.035
The son has a place there
forever, so if the son makes you

00:10:42.035 --> 00:10:43.678
free, you will be free indeed.
 

00:10:43.678 --> 00:10:45.710
I know that you are descendants
of Abraham,

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:50.048
yet you look for an opportunity
to kill me [Wait a minute,

00:10:50.048 --> 00:10:54.365
Jesus, these are the people who
believe in you.]

00:10:54.365 --> 00:10:58.590
because there's no place in you
for my word.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.110
I declare what I have seen in
the Father's presence.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.932
As for you, you should do what
you have heard from the

00:11:01.932 --> 00:11:02.450
Father."
 

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.889
They answered him,
Well Abraham's our father,

00:11:04.889 --> 00:11:05.610
we're Jews.
 

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.551
Jesus said to them,
"If you are Abraham's

00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:09.580
children you would be doing what
Abraham did.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.905
But now you are trying to kill
me and a man who has told you

00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:14.389
the truth that I heard from God,
that's not what Abraham did.

00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:16.428
You are indeed doing what your
father said."

00:11:16.428 --> 00:11:18.653
They said to him,
"We are not bastards,

00:11:18.653 --> 00:11:21.499
we are not illegitimate
children, we have one father God

00:11:21.499 --> 00:11:22.120
Himself.
 

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.169
So they try another tactic,
well if he won't be satisfied

00:11:24.169 --> 00:11:25.561
with Abraham as being the
Father, okay,

00:11:25.561 --> 00:11:26.769
we'll have God as our Father.
 

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.725
Jesus said to them,
"If God were your Father

00:11:28.725 --> 00:11:30.273
you would love me,
for I came from God,

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:31.168
and now I am here.
 

00:11:31.168 --> 00:11:32.840
I did not come of my own,
but he sent me.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.250
Why do you not understand what
I say?

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:35.389
Is it because you cannot accept
my word?

00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:36.690
You are from your father the
devil."

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:40.480
The devil?
 

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.519
These are the people who
believe in him,

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:45.820
and Jesus ends up the whole
thing as I told--

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.351
they finally end up saying,
yeah the Jews in verse 48 the

00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:51.432
Jews are saying,
"Are we not right in

00:11:51.432 --> 00:11:53.408
saying that you are a Samaritan
and have a demon?"

00:11:53.408 --> 00:11:56.865
Now they're both being
antagonistic,

00:11:56.865 --> 00:12:02.789
and finally the chapter ends
way down there as I talked about

00:12:02.789 --> 00:12:06.265
last time verse 56,
"Your ancestor Abraham

00:12:06.265 --> 00:12:08.355
rejoiced that he would see my
day, he saw it and was

00:12:08.355 --> 00:12:08.928
glad."
 

00:12:08.928 --> 00:12:10.595
Then the Jews said to him,
"You are not yet fifty

00:12:10.595 --> 00:12:12.009
years old, and have you seen
Abraham?"

00:12:12.009 --> 00:12:15.230
Jesus said to him,
"Very truly I tell you,

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.538
before Abraham was,
I am."

00:12:17.538 --> 00:12:20.572
There's that strong
Christological claim of Jesus

00:12:20.572 --> 00:12:23.532
being God himself,
and of course they picked up

00:12:23.532 --> 00:12:26.190
stones to throw at him,
but Jesus hid himself and went

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:26.950
out of the temple.
 

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.327
Notice there are these things
going on, Jesus speaks in

00:12:30.327 --> 00:12:32.330
riddles in the Gospel of John.
 

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:37.148
Jesus does not do what a good
Yale instructor is supposed to

00:12:37.148 --> 00:12:40.169
do, which is explain things to
you.

00:12:40.169 --> 00:12:42.070
Jesus talks in riddles.
 

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.379
When they ask questions he
responds in--with non-sequiturs.

00:12:45.379 --> 00:12:49.238
And then when they act like
they want to believe in him he

00:12:49.238 --> 00:12:52.418
pushes them and then starts
picking at them,

00:12:52.418 --> 00:12:55.431
and accusing them of stuff and
eventually the scene ends up

00:12:55.431 --> 00:12:57.298
with everybody is all
frustrated,

00:12:57.298 --> 00:12:59.308
Jesus is accusing them of
trying to kill him,

00:12:59.308 --> 00:13:02.889
and sure enough then they do
start to try to kill him.

00:13:02.889 --> 00:13:07.014
Notice how in the Gospel of
John repeatedly these issues

00:13:07.014 --> 00:13:09.039
come down to Christology.
 

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:11.418
Who is the person of Jesus?
 

00:13:11.418 --> 00:13:15.144
The point at which they pick up
the stones to throw at him is

00:13:15.144 --> 00:13:18.000
when he makes this claim by
quoting Exodus,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.460
the very name of God,
that Jesus himself is God.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.740
Now with all that going on
let's look at how this then

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.649
plays itself out in the first
letter of John.

00:13:34.038 --> 00:13:37.870
Just to back up,
remember how diverse we're

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.325
finding Christianity,
and we're going to start seeing

00:13:41.325 --> 00:13:43.570
that diversity now representing
itself in Christology.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.529
We have seen it already in
geography, right?

00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:49.687
We've seen that,
and according to the Book of

00:13:49.687 --> 00:13:51.755
Acts,
the Gospel spread out in

00:13:51.755 --> 00:13:54.899
concentric circles from
Jerusalem to Judea,

00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:56.519
to Samaria to the ends of the
earth,

00:13:56.519 --> 00:13:59.514
but we also saw how in Acts if
you read it critically between

00:13:59.514 --> 00:14:02.360
the lines you can see it didn't
really spread that way.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.485
There were anonymous Christians
who went off out of Jerusalem

00:14:05.485 --> 00:14:08.298
after a certain period of
persecution and they took the

00:14:08.298 --> 00:14:11.110
message to Cyrene and to
different parts of the east of

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.080
the Mediterranean and these were
anonymous people,

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.340
we don't know them,
they weren't Peter.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.879
Then later Paul and Barnabas
take things around,

00:14:17.879 --> 00:14:20.437
and Phillip goes off to
Samaria, and maybe there's this

00:14:20.437 --> 00:14:23.090
Ethiopian eunuch in the Book of
Acts who's converted,

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.210
and he may take the Gospel back
to Ethiopia.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.211
So the spread of Christianity
historically was much messier

00:14:28.211 --> 00:14:31.317
then it really is portrayed in
any straightforward way in the

00:14:31.317 --> 00:14:32.250
New Testament.
 

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.085
It seemed to have been spread
by just people going to their

00:14:35.085 --> 00:14:38.018
home villages and hometowns and
taking back this message that

00:14:38.018 --> 00:14:39.730
they heard in different places.
 

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:42.855
The way the Gospel spreads,
the way Christianity spreads is

00:14:42.855 --> 00:14:43.610
differently.
 

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.139
We saw, for example,
that in Thomasine Christianity,

00:14:46.139 --> 00:14:48.828
which seems to have been very
popular in Syria and then all

00:14:48.828 --> 00:14:51.523
the way into India,
that's a form of Christianity

00:14:51.523 --> 00:14:55.044
that's slightly different from
the form of Christianity that's

00:14:55.044 --> 00:14:56.950
rising up in Rome at the time.
 

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:00.260
Although church tradition says
that Peter was the one who took

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.028
the Gospel to Rome and founded
the church there,

00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:06.056
well, we have good reasons as
you can tell why we historians

00:15:06.056 --> 00:15:07.029
tend to doubt that.
 

00:15:07.029 --> 00:15:07.389
Why?
 

00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:10.738
Because we attend--we believe
basically that again anonymous

00:15:10.738 --> 00:15:13.972
Christians who are lost to
history probably were the first

00:15:13.972 --> 00:15:16.129
ones who took the Gospel to
Rome,

00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:19.870
and then Peter became connected
--with that tradition.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.418
There's a certain kind of
Christianity that's growing up

00:15:22.418 --> 00:15:24.207
in Rome,
there's another kind of

00:15:24.207 --> 00:15:27.100
Christianity that's growing up
in Syria and India,

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.937
there's another kind of
Christianity that's growing up

00:15:29.937 --> 00:15:32.509
in Antioch and in that part of
western Syria,

00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:34.538
and there's another kind of
Christianity we don't know

00:15:34.538 --> 00:15:36.719
anything about at this point
that's probably growing up in

00:15:36.719 --> 00:15:38.322
Egypt,
we just don't have enough

00:15:38.322 --> 00:15:40.879
sources to know what kind of
Christianity may have been

00:15:40.879 --> 00:15:41.970
growing up in Egypt.
 

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:45.654
There's different geographical
regions experiencing different

00:15:45.654 --> 00:15:48.509
kinds of Christianity,
and those different kinds of

00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:51.009
Christianity are diverse with
respect to the Torah,

00:15:51.009 --> 00:15:52.440
the Jewish law right?
 

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.081
If there's another--if there is
still a form of Christianity

00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:59.663
that's predominantly Jewish
that's located in Jerusalem and

00:15:59.663 --> 00:16:02.379
it's led by James the brother of
Jesus,

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:05.905
who seems to have been famous
for advocating a certain kind of

00:16:05.905 --> 00:16:09.490
law observant Torah obedient
form of discipleship to Jesus,

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.048
then you've got a form of
Jewish Christianity that still

00:16:12.048 --> 00:16:14.989
seems to be keeping the law,
and we've seen that reflected

00:16:14.989 --> 00:16:16.850
possibly in the Gospel of
Matthew,

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:20.307
with its teaching that the law
is still something that people

00:16:20.307 --> 00:16:21.230
ought to obey.
 

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.966
We've seen though that the
Gospel of Mark teaches a

00:16:23.966 --> 00:16:26.597
Christianity that maybe it--
some people say Mark was

00:16:26.597 --> 00:16:28.894
written in Rome,
other people say maybe Mark was

00:16:28.894 --> 00:16:31.514
written in Syria or in Galilee,
but it's some kind of

00:16:31.514 --> 00:16:33.720
Christianity that's now
predominantly Gentile,

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.529
although it still has Jewish
elements,

00:16:35.529 --> 00:16:38.070
but these are people who are
not keeping the law.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.183
They seem to believe that they
don't have to keep the Jewish

00:16:40.183 --> 00:16:40.399
law.
 

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:43.601
Then we've got the form of
Christianity in Luke that we saw

00:16:43.601 --> 00:16:47.424
where the Torah,
the law, represents a certain

00:16:47.424 --> 00:16:52.095
an ethnic tradition of the Jews,
so if you're Jewish you should

00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:54.831
keep the law but if you're a
Gentile you don't need to keep

00:16:54.831 --> 00:16:55.350
the law.
 

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.941
Then we saw from the Gospel of
Thomas and the Gospel of John

00:16:58.941 --> 00:17:01.620
where is the concern about the
law at all?

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:02.808
It's not really there.
 

00:17:02.808 --> 00:17:05.130
You can read all the way
through the Gospel of John,

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.318
sure there are some
controversies about the Sabbath,

00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:08.640
about what you can do on the
Sabbath,

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.246
but disputes about observation
of Jewish law are not really at

00:17:13.246 --> 00:17:17.776
issue in the Gospel of Thomas
and they're not really at issue

00:17:17.776 --> 00:17:19.740
in the Gospel of John.
 

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.430
What is at issue in the Gospel
of John is Christology.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:25.598
What do you believe about Jesus?
 

00:17:25.598 --> 00:17:28.420
Let's look at the different
kinds of Christologies you get

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.390
in early Christianity too before
we move onto the letters.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:36.890
First Mark, the Gospel of Mark,
what is Mark's Christology?

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.529
What is his doctrine of Christ?
 

00:17:38.529 --> 00:17:41.262
Well for one thing,
according to Mark,

00:17:41.262 --> 00:17:45.104
Jesus is the Son of God,
now that doesn't necessarily

00:17:45.104 --> 00:17:48.871
mean yet that Jesus is
completely divine or equal to

00:17:48.871 --> 00:17:49.608
God.
 

00:17:49.608 --> 00:17:53.144
You can be called a Son of God
without necessarily being God

00:17:53.144 --> 00:17:55.660
himself in this period of
Christianity,

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.608
but at least Mark certainly
considers Jesus the Son of God.

00:17:58.608 --> 00:18:01.923
He also, though,
considers Jesus to be the

00:18:01.923 --> 00:18:05.803
Messiah, the Christ,
who has to suffer and Jesus'

00:18:05.803 --> 00:18:10.410
suffering is for the purpose of
ransoming us sinners.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:14.295
Now the Christology that Mark's
working with is Jesus is the

00:18:14.295 --> 00:18:15.961
Messiah,
the Son of God,

00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:19.345
it's mandated that he suffers,
so it's God's will that the

00:18:19.345 --> 00:18:20.160
Messiah suffer.
 

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.611
And that's one of the reasons
he writes his Gospel is to

00:18:22.611 --> 00:18:25.374
convince his readers that Jesus'
suffering and execution wasn't

00:18:25.374 --> 00:18:27.380
an accident and it wasn't a
catastrophe,

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.410
and it wasn't a calamity,
it was God's will,

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:31.130
it needed to happen.
 

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:35.490
So the suffering Son of God is
part of Mark's Christology.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.817
If you get to Luke,
as I've said before,

00:18:38.817 --> 00:18:43.510
this whole idea that Jesus'
death was a ransom is not in

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:44.279
Luke.
 

00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:47.662
In fact, Luke excises that part
of Mark when he's copying that

00:18:47.662 --> 00:18:50.413
part of Mark,
and he leaves out that ransom

00:18:50.413 --> 00:18:54.269
passage from Mark because that
doesn't fit his Christology.

00:18:54.269 --> 00:18:57.189
For the Christology of Luke,
do you remember,

00:18:57.189 --> 00:18:59.842
Luke and Acts,
what is the Christology of

00:18:59.842 --> 00:19:00.440
Luke?
 

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.730
Anybody want to venture a
remembrance?

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:06.338
The martyr prophet exactly.
 

00:19:06.338 --> 00:19:11.098
Jesus is the martyr prophet
who's an example for Stephen,

00:19:11.098 --> 00:19:14.900
or Paul, or all of us who are
followers of Jesus,

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.923
we're all martyr prophets,
we're called to be martyr

00:19:16.923 --> 00:19:19.328
prophets,
that's not a ransom for many.

00:19:19.328 --> 00:19:23.608
Luke doesn't have a doctrine of
the atonement,

00:19:23.608 --> 00:19:28.030
the Christian doctrine that
says, the death of Jesus was to

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:32.757
pay for the sins of humanity or
to redeem human beings from the

00:19:32.757 --> 00:19:36.288
debts of sin,
so that's Luke's.

00:19:36.288 --> 00:19:39.924
The Gospel of Thomas,
there's no death at all in the

00:19:39.924 --> 00:19:41.279
Gospel of Thomas.
 

00:19:41.279 --> 00:19:44.838
The Christology of the Gospel
of Thomas though is that Jesus

00:19:44.838 --> 00:19:48.460
comes across as practically an
already resurrected figure.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.258
He's a knower,
he's a figure of wisdom who's

00:19:51.258 --> 00:19:54.056
come from the Father,
who's come from above,

00:19:54.056 --> 00:19:57.568
and he comes to give his
disciples true knowledge.

00:19:57.568 --> 00:20:02.980
So Jesus as the revealer of
hidden knowledge is the main

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.720
Christology of the Gospel of
Thomas.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.170
Now the Gospel of John,
this is when you get closest to

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.880
what will be seen as orthodox
Christianity.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:20.172
A lot of orthodox Christology
was set at least,

00:20:20.172 --> 00:20:26.500
at one of the main periods,
at the Council of Nicaea.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:35.838
So we call this the Council of
Nicaea in 325 of our era CE,

00:20:35.838 --> 00:20:38.220
there was a council called
together by the Emperor

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.328
Constantine who was tired of all
these Christians squabbling,

00:20:41.328 --> 00:20:45.258
especially about Christology,
and he got bishops and people

00:20:45.258 --> 00:20:48.188
from around the empire,
and he tried to get them to

00:20:48.188 --> 00:20:49.140
come to an agreement.
 

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:53.259
They wrote what has come down
to be called the Nicene Creed.

00:20:53.259 --> 00:20:57.480
And a lot of Christians,
Roman Catholics,

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.588
Episcopalians,
Anglicans, some other churches,

00:21:00.588 --> 00:21:04.779
will actually say the Nicene
Creed in church as part of the

00:21:04.779 --> 00:21:05.720
literature.
 

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.000
Can anybody say it?
 

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.410
We believe in--some of you know
it,

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:15.836
yes, you know the Nicene Creed,
so that Nicene Creed about

00:21:15.836 --> 00:21:17.893
Jesus being very God,
from very God,

00:21:17.893 --> 00:21:19.338
God from God,
light from light,

00:21:19.338 --> 00:21:22.182
begotten not made,
because that was one of the

00:21:22.182 --> 00:21:25.626
Christological--
so was Jesus Son of God because

00:21:25.626 --> 00:21:29.796
he was born from eternity as
divine or did God say at one

00:21:29.796 --> 00:21:34.336
point okay he's a really good
guy I'm going to graduate him to

00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:35.900
divinity status?
 

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.470
That was one Christology.
 

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.913
The Nicene Creed said,
no, Jesus did not become divine

00:21:41.913 --> 00:21:43.410
he always was divine.
 

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:47.500
The orthodox Christology was
set to a great extent by the

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.928
Nicene Creed in 325,
but how do we get from the year

00:21:51.928 --> 00:21:56.115
30 when Jesus is crucified,
the year 70 when the Jerusalem

00:21:56.115 --> 00:21:59.076
temple is destroyed and the
Gospel of Mark may have been

00:21:59.076 --> 00:22:01.698
published,
the 50s when Paul was writing

00:22:01.698 --> 00:22:03.939
his letters,
maybe a year in the 90s when

00:22:03.939 --> 00:22:07.361
the Gospel of John is writing,
from those times all the way to

00:22:07.361 --> 00:22:11.144
year 325 where there's a whole
lot of fighting going on between

00:22:11.144 --> 00:22:14.683
Christians trying to solidify
what the orthodox Christology

00:22:14.683 --> 00:22:15.598
should be?
 

00:22:15.598 --> 00:22:17.618
Of these different sources
we've talked about,

00:22:17.618 --> 00:22:20.875
the one that comes the closest
to the Nicene Creed is this

00:22:20.875 --> 00:22:22.990
Christology of the Gospel of
John,

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:26.450
because according to John,
Jesus is fully God,

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:31.618
co-equal with the Father,
he's I am,

00:22:31.618 --> 00:22:34.192
that is identifying himself
with the figure who appeared to

00:22:34.192 --> 00:22:37.288
Moses in the burning bush,
he's the descending and

00:22:37.288 --> 00:22:41.114
ascending redeemer,
he's also the lamb of God

00:22:41.114 --> 00:22:45.914
sacrificed for the people,
and in his sacrifice he takes

00:22:45.914 --> 00:22:48.200
away the sins of the world.
 

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.089
All those elements that would
end up becoming orthodox

00:22:52.089 --> 00:22:54.586
Christianity,
orthodox Christology,

00:22:54.586 --> 00:22:57.890
those can be found in the
Gospel of John.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:00.519
Now how do we get from there to
1 John?

00:23:00.519 --> 00:23:02.078
Any questions about that?
 

00:23:02.078 --> 00:23:04.517
What I want you to really see
is I want you to be able to

00:23:04.517 --> 00:23:06.430
anchor down,
not just take my word for it

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.618
that well,
Professor Martin knows all

00:23:08.618 --> 00:23:11.488
things about all things,
and he tells me that there are

00:23:11.488 --> 00:23:13.682
these different Christology's
and these different early

00:23:13.682 --> 00:23:15.955
Christian documents and so
that's what I'm going to write

00:23:15.955 --> 00:23:16.809
back on a paper.
 

00:23:16.809 --> 00:23:17.390
I don't want that.
 

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:20.113
What I want you to do is be
able to actually anchor down

00:23:20.113 --> 00:23:22.736
these ideas into these
particular texts that come from

00:23:22.736 --> 00:23:25.460
particular different places in
early Christianity,

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:29.859
so any questions about that?
 

00:23:29.859 --> 00:23:30.618
Yes sir?
 

00:23:30.618 --> 00:23:33.509
Student: 
&gt;

00:23:33.509 --> 00:23:35.704
Prof: The Christology of
Matthew is quite a bit like

00:23:35.704 --> 00:23:35.970
Mark.
 

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.093
Matthew also believes that the
death of Jesus,

00:23:39.093 --> 00:23:42.007
for example,
was as a ransom for people and

00:23:42.007 --> 00:23:42.910
for sins.
 

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.827
Matthew also believes that
Jesus is the Son of God and that

00:23:46.827 --> 00:23:48.180
he is the Messiah.
 

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:54.357
Exactly how divine Jesus is in
the Gospel of Matthew is up for

00:23:54.357 --> 00:23:56.038
grabs,
it's not clear,

00:23:56.038 --> 00:23:58.960
but he still--he definitely
seems to believe that Jesus is

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.190
divine in some sense.
 

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:03.740
Matthew's Christology is not
too much different from Mark's.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.858
The one thing that makes him a
bit different is that he seems

00:24:06.858 --> 00:24:09.665
to also take Jesus to be
something like a new Moses who

00:24:09.665 --> 00:24:11.824
either--
who not is giving a new law but

00:24:11.824 --> 00:24:14.348
is interpreting the Mosaic Law
in the proper way,

00:24:14.348 --> 00:24:17.000
so Jesus as a law giver and
Jesus as a teacher is also

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.900
important for Matthew's
Christology.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:23.420
Any other questions?
 

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:28.304
Okay look at 1 John,
the first letter of John,

00:24:28.304 --> 00:24:33.078
right toward the end of the New
Testament.

00:24:33.078 --> 00:24:37.027
Now, first, there are several
different connections with 1

00:24:37.027 --> 00:24:40.490
John to the Gospel that you can
see immediately.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:42.900
Let's hop through the Gospel
and see these.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.210
First look at the very
beginning,

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:46.608
"We declare to you what
was from the beginning,

00:24:46.608 --> 00:24:49.029
what we have heard,
what we have seen with our

00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:50.619
eyes,
what we have looked at and

00:24:50.619 --> 00:24:52.585
touched with our hands
concerning the word of

00:24:52.585 --> 00:24:53.210
life."
 

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:56.420
That all should sound familiar,
there's the seeing motif,

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.670
the hearing motif,
and even the touching thing

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.080
because,
if you remember,

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.474
it's in the Gospel of John that
you have that famous scene where

00:25:03.474 --> 00:25:07.029
doubting Thomas wants to touch
Jesus' body to make sure about--

00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:08.450
that this is the real Jesus.
 

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:11.584
"This life was revealed,
and we have seen it and

00:25:11.584 --> 00:25:14.519
testified to it [testimony and
testifying and witnessing is

00:25:14.519 --> 00:25:17.656
part of the Gospel of John also]
and declare to you the eternal

00:25:17.656 --> 00:25:20.846
life [eternal life is one of the
themes from the Gospel of John]

00:25:20.846 --> 00:25:23.630
that was with the Father and
was revealed to us.

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.016
[There's Jesus as the
revealer.]

00:25:25.016 --> 00:25:27.743
We declared to you what we have
seen and heard so that you may

00:25:27.743 --> 00:25:29.220
also have fellowship with us.
 

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.801
And truly our fellowship is
with the Father and his Son

00:25:31.801 --> 00:25:32.519
Jesus Christ.
 

00:25:32.519 --> 00:25:35.250
We are writing these things so
that our joy may be complete.

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:38.709
We're in the same world,
the same linguistic,

00:25:38.709 --> 00:25:42.560
the same discursive,
the same theological world as

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.368
the Gospel of John.
 

00:25:44.368 --> 00:25:46.178
Look at 1:5,
"This is the message we

00:25:46.178 --> 00:25:48.529
have heard from him and
proclaimed to you that God is

00:25:48.529 --> 00:25:50.700
light and in him there is no
darkness."

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.009
That wonderful light/darkness
motif.

00:25:53.009 --> 00:25:55.377
Look at verse 7:
If we walk in the light,

00:25:55.377 --> 00:25:58.074
as he himself in the light,
we have fellowship with one

00:25:58.074 --> 00:26:00.970
another and the blood of Jesus
his son cleanses us from all

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:01.420
sin.
 

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:05.528
The blood of Jesus being
significant there too.

00:26:05.528 --> 00:26:09.971
2:29: "If you know that he
is righteous you,

00:26:09.971 --> 00:26:15.153
may be sure that everyone who
does right has been born of

00:26:15.153 --> 00:26:16.450
him."
 

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:22.019
So born of him recalls this
birth stuff we've just seen in

00:26:22.019 --> 00:26:22.900
John 3.
 

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.432
And there are lots of others,
if you just read through the

00:26:25.432 --> 00:26:28.008
first letter of John and you
keep your ear attuned to those

00:26:28.008 --> 00:26:30.630
themes that you've already seen
in the Gospel of John,

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:32.595
you can just underline them and
highlight them all the way

00:26:32.595 --> 00:26:34.568
through the letter of John,
so they're there.

00:26:34.568 --> 00:26:37.980
There are some interesting
problems with this letter also.

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:42.980
Look at 1:8:
If we say we have no sin we

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:47.838
deceive ourselves and the truth
is not in us.

00:26:47.838 --> 00:26:51.019
If we confess our sins,
he who is faithful and just

00:26:51.019 --> 00:26:54.008
will forgive us our sins and
cleanse us from all

00:26:54.008 --> 00:26:55.279
unrighteousness.
 

00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:58.049
If we say that we have not
sinned we make him a liar and

00:26:58.049 --> 00:26:59.259
his word is not in us.
 

00:26:59.259 --> 00:27:02.308
All of us are sinners, yay!
 

00:27:02.308 --> 00:27:05.459
You just have to confess your
sin and Jesus will cure you of

00:27:05.459 --> 00:27:05.779
sin.
 

00:27:05.779 --> 00:27:06.960
We're all sinners.
 

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.278
Anybody who says they're not
sinners has a problem.

00:27:09.278 --> 00:27:13.215
Now look at 3:5,
"You know that he was

00:27:13.215 --> 00:27:18.558
revealed to take away sins and
in him there is no sin,

00:27:18.558 --> 00:27:24.220
no one who abides in him
sins."

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:28.588
I thought we just said we are
sinners.

00:27:28.588 --> 00:27:33.208
"No one who sins has
either seen him or known

00:27:33.208 --> 00:27:34.338
him."
 

00:27:34.338 --> 00:27:42.490
That sounds a little
problematic.

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:45.902
Everyone who commits sin is a
child of the devil,

00:27:45.902 --> 00:27:49.598
for the devil has been sinning
from the beginning.

00:27:49.598 --> 00:27:52.047
The Son of God was revealed to
this person to destroy the works

00:27:52.047 --> 00:27:52.640
of the devil.
 

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.865
Those who have been born of God
do not sin because God's seed

00:27:55.865 --> 00:27:56.779
abides in them.
 

00:27:56.779 --> 00:27:59.009
They cannot sin because they
have been born of God.

00:27:59.009 --> 00:28:01.269
The children of God and the
children of the devil are

00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:02.269
revealed in this way.
 

00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:04.417
All who do not do what is right
are not from God,

00:28:04.417 --> 00:28:07.058
nor are those who do not love
their brothers and sisters.

00:28:07.058 --> 00:28:09.886
Now wait a minute,
the first part he says,

00:28:09.886 --> 00:28:12.990
we all sin and we have to
confess our sins.

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.752
In this part it says,
if you're in him you don't sin,

00:28:15.752 --> 00:28:17.880
and if you do sin you're in the
devil.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:22.030
Look at 5:18,
"We know that those who

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:26.747
are born of God do not sin,
but the one who is born of God

00:28:26.747 --> 00:28:29.990
protects them and the evil one
does not touch them."

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:33.598
Well which is it?
 

00:28:33.598 --> 00:28:40.328
Do Christians in John's church
sin or do they not sin?

00:28:40.328 --> 00:28:45.480
Is there a contradiction here
in the text?

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.598
That's not the only weird place
in this letter,

00:28:47.598 --> 00:28:55.112
look at what he says about love
in 2:5: "Whoever obeys his

00:28:55.112 --> 00:29:01.412
word truly in this person the
love of God has reached

00:29:01.412 --> 00:29:03.230
perfection.
 

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:07.588
By this we may be sure that we
are in him."

00:29:07.588 --> 00:29:13.750
Love is supposed to be there,
2:10,

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:15.554
"Whoever loves a
brother,"

00:29:15.554 --> 00:29:18.544
now your English translation
may say "or sister,"

00:29:18.544 --> 00:29:20.709
but the Greek just says
"brother"

00:29:20.709 --> 00:29:23.492
and maybe it's supposed to
include sisters also but the

00:29:23.492 --> 00:29:26.122
gender of the Greek word is just
"brother"

00:29:26.122 --> 00:29:28.028
at this point in the Greek.
 

00:29:28.028 --> 00:29:31.063
"Whoever loves a brother
lives in the light and in such a

00:29:31.063 --> 00:29:33.400
person there is no cause for
stumbling."

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:37.545
Okay so that talks about loving
one's brother,

00:29:37.545 --> 00:29:39.940
well who is the brother?
 

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:44.548
It seems like the brothers for
this writer are other members of

00:29:44.548 --> 00:29:46.108
the same community.
 

00:29:46.108 --> 00:29:48.786
He's not necessarily talking
about your physical brother,

00:29:48.786 --> 00:29:51.174
your blood brother,
but he's also not talking about

00:29:51.174 --> 00:29:52.368
just any human being.
 

00:29:52.368 --> 00:29:54.098
Notice how this works several
times,

00:29:54.098 --> 00:29:56.959
so look at 2:15,
so we're supposed to love and

00:29:56.959 --> 00:30:00.009
we're supposed to love our
brothers but 2:15,

00:30:00.009 --> 00:30:03.578
"Do not love the world or
the things in the world.

00:30:03.578 --> 00:30:07.236
The love of the Father is not
in those who love the

00:30:07.236 --> 00:30:08.259
world."
 

00:30:08.259 --> 00:30:14.590
So we're not supposed to love
the world, "Love not the

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:18.630
world, do not love the
world."

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.929
Remember the word for world I
said last time was

00:30:20.929 --> 00:30:22.740
cosmos,
the entire universe.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:27.281
Does this sound a little odd if
you think back on what may be

00:30:27.281 --> 00:30:31.220
the most famous verse in the
entire New Testament?

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:36.480
If you go to football games
anybody know what the most

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.160
famous football verse is?
 

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.817
John 3:16, you see it on
posters--do they still--they did

00:30:42.817 --> 00:30:46.605
that years ago do--they don't
still do the posters I guess,

00:30:46.605 --> 00:30:47.259
right?
 

00:30:47.259 --> 00:30:50.529
Just one guy does it all over
the whole NFL?

00:30:50.529 --> 00:30:54.000
John 3:16--yes sir?
 

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.688
Student:  Well I was
going to say during the VCS

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:59.425
National Championship game
before the quarterback wore a

00:30:59.425 --> 00:31:00.970
John 3:16 on his eye block.
 

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:01.858
Prof: Did they win?
 

00:31:01.858 --> 00:31:03.558
Student:  They did win
and he made it the number one

00:31:03.558 --> 00:31:04.380
Google search (inaudible).
 

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.460
Prof: Great!
 

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:10.444
The Florida quarterback wore
John 3:16 on his cheeks,

00:31:10.444 --> 00:31:14.951
these cheeks I suppose,
and that's why they won,

00:31:14.951 --> 00:31:16.390
okay, good.
 

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:19.335
What does John 3:16 say,
let's quote it,

00:31:19.335 --> 00:31:22.130
"For God so loved the
world--

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:23.391
Students:
 "â€¦that he gave

00:31:23.391 --> 00:31:26.670
his only begotten Son--"
Prof: You all are wimpy.

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:29.790
"For God so loved the word
that he gave his only begotten

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:30.967
Son--
," "--for God so

00:31:30.967 --> 00:31:31.690
loved the world."
 

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:36.568
1 John 2:15,
"Do not love the

00:31:36.568 --> 00:31:38.640
world."
 

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.368
Yes sir?
 

00:31:40.368 --> 00:31:43.788
Student: 
&gt;

00:31:43.788 --> 00:31:45.207
Prof: I believe so,
I actually haven't checked,

00:31:45.207 --> 00:31:46.328
does anybody have a Greek New
Testament?

00:31:46.328 --> 00:31:48.929
Michael has a Greek,
Michael's going to look it up

00:31:48.929 --> 00:31:51.740
while I continue,
this is 2:15 and see if

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:56.538
cosmos or some other word
is the word for world though.

00:31:56.538 --> 00:31:57.960
We'll get back to you on that
question.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:02.361
Look at 3:1:
See what love the Father has

00:32:02.361 --> 00:32:05.268
given us that we should be
called children of God,

00:32:05.268 --> 00:32:06.868
and that is what we are.
 

00:32:06.868 --> 00:32:11.723
The reason the world does not
know us is that it did not know

00:32:11.723 --> 00:32:12.210
him.
 

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:14.910
Love is part of that,
look at 3:11:

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:18.085
For this is the message you
have heard from the beginning,

00:32:18.085 --> 00:32:19.980
that we should love one
another.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:26.308
This is loving one another;
it's not talking here so much

00:32:26.308 --> 00:32:27.990
about loving the world.
 

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:30.398
Look at 3:14:
We know that we have passed

00:32:30.398 --> 00:32:32.548
from death to life because we
love one another.

00:32:32.548 --> 00:32:34.720
Whoever does not love abides in
death.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.380
Look at 3:23:
And this is his commandment,

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.818
that we should believe in the
name of his Son Jesus Christ and

00:32:39.818 --> 00:32:41.779
love one another,
just as he has commanded us.

00:32:41.779 --> 00:32:44.355
Look at 4:7:
Beloved let us love one another

00:32:44.355 --> 00:32:46.759
because love is from God,
and everyone who loves is born

00:32:46.759 --> 00:32:47.809
of God and knows God.
 

00:32:47.809 --> 00:32:51.393
Look at 4:11:
Beloved since God loved us so

00:32:51.393 --> 00:32:54.597
much we ought to love [not the
world but]

00:32:54.597 --> 00:32:55.799
one another.
 

00:32:55.799 --> 00:32:57.608
Verse 12:
No one has ever seen God.

00:32:57.608 --> 00:33:00.324
If we love one another,
God loves is in us and his love

00:33:00.324 --> 00:33:01.380
is perfected in us.
 

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:03.269
What about the translation?
 

00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:04.818
Student:  Same verb,
same noun.

00:33:04.818 --> 00:33:09.298
Prof: Same verb,
same noun in John 3:16 and 1

00:33:09.298 --> 00:33:12.900
John 2:15, so is there a
contradiction?

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.615
That's just all I'm asking,
the Gospel of John talks about

00:33:15.615 --> 00:33:18.731
God loving the world,
the cosmos, and 1 John says

00:33:18.731 --> 00:33:22.240
Christians are not supposed to
love the cosmos.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.326
Contradiction,
we don't know,

00:33:24.326 --> 00:33:25.220
maybe not.
 

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:31.907
Look at 4:16:
So we have known and believe

00:33:31.907 --> 00:33:33.890
the love that God has for us.
 

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:38.361
God is love and those who abide
in love abide in God and God

00:33:38.361 --> 00:33:39.650
abides in them.
 

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.123
[Keep reading.]
Love has indeed been perfected

00:33:42.123 --> 00:33:45.144
among us in this that we may
have boldness in the Day of

00:33:45.144 --> 00:33:45.858
Judgment.
 

00:33:45.858 --> 00:33:50.019
Because as he is so are we in
this world.

00:33:50.019 --> 00:33:53.410
There is no fear in love but
perfect love casts out fear.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.554
For fear has to do with
punishment, and whoever fears

00:33:55.554 --> 00:33:57.078
has not reached perfection in
love.

00:33:57.078 --> 00:33:59.068
We love because he first loved
us.

00:33:59.068 --> 00:34:00.857
Those who say,
"I love God,"

00:34:00.857 --> 00:34:03.130
and hate their brothers or
sisters are liars.

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:06.400
And for those who do not love a
brother or sister whom they have

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.840
seen cannot love God whom they
have not seen.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:12.704
The commandment we have from
his is this: those who love God

00:34:12.704 --> 00:34:14.539
must love all of humanity.
 

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:20.989
What?
 

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:26.110
No, I'm lying to you again;
follow along in your Bibles.

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:28.070
See, some of you went to sleep.
 

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:31.090
Look at 21:
The commandment we have from

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.579
him is this, those who love God
must love their brothers.

00:34:33.579 --> 00:34:38.119
There's nothing in 1 John about
loving the world,

00:34:38.119 --> 00:34:43.489
about loving humanity,
about loving all humankind,

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:45.639
all mankind,
there's nothing like that in

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:47.090
the first letter of John.
 

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:50.867
What you do have in the first
letter of John is that God is

00:34:50.867 --> 00:34:53.994
love, but that Christians,
the followers of John,

00:34:53.994 --> 00:34:55.820
must not love the world.
 

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.320
The world doesn't love them,
they don't love the world.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.168
This is again a radically
sectarian kind of stance,

00:35:01.168 --> 00:35:03.333
and in fact,
there's nothing here about

00:35:03.333 --> 00:35:04.530
loving outsiders.
 

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:08.807
According to the first letter
of John, all this love that's

00:35:08.807 --> 00:35:12.864
talked about is basically
centered only on the community

00:35:12.864 --> 00:35:14.119
of believers.
 

00:35:14.119 --> 00:35:17.090
It's an internal love,
it's brotherly love but that

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:19.409
means that the term
"brothers"

00:35:19.409 --> 00:35:22.559
is taken to mean members of
John's own community.

00:35:22.559 --> 00:35:27.016
There's nowhere that Christians
in 1 John are told to love

00:35:27.016 --> 00:35:29.440
people outside the community.
 

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.829
They're told repeatedly to love
people inside the community.

00:35:32.829 --> 00:35:33.659
Yes sir?
 

00:35:33.659 --> 00:35:36.980
Student: 
&gt;

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.606
Prof: Out of
brother--just to the community

00:35:39.606 --> 00:35:40.409
of believers?
 

00:35:40.409 --> 00:35:43.639
Well you just have to analyze
the letter and see how does it

00:35:43.639 --> 00:35:46.652
occur here and just go through
it, it occurs all the way

00:35:46.652 --> 00:35:47.309
through.
 

00:35:47.309 --> 00:35:49.637
For example,
I think you could definitely

00:35:49.637 --> 00:35:53.947
prove it with letters of Paul,
who specifically uses it for

00:35:53.947 --> 00:35:58.980
both Gentiles and Jews but only
within the body of Christ.

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:01.387
Whether that's the case here,
you just have to read the

00:36:01.387 --> 00:36:01.789
letter.
 

00:36:01.789 --> 00:36:05.356
I would argue that it is,
and it's precisely because I

00:36:05.356 --> 00:36:09.056
read the letter as setting up
this dichotomy between the

00:36:09.056 --> 00:36:12.219
outside cosmos and the inside
brotherhood,

00:36:12.219 --> 00:36:15.219
but it's just a matter of
reading the letter.

00:36:15.219 --> 00:36:18.380
The word in itself wouldn't
necessarily supply that.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.500
Any other questions?
 

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.630
Yes sir?
 

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:21.929
Student:  Is that the
same as

00:36:21.929 --> 00:36:22.969
&gt;?
 

00:36:22.969 --> 00:36:24.724
Prof: Yes,
I believe--well sometimes it's

00:36:24.724 --> 00:36:26.329
philia and sometimes
agape.

00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:29.199
Student: 
&gt;

00:36:29.199 --> 00:36:32.496
Prof: Okay,
in the epistles it's almost

00:36:32.496 --> 00:36:34.110
always agape.
 

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:39.340
Any other questions?
 

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.346
In other words,
what I'm reading in 1 John is

00:36:41.346 --> 00:36:43.489
representing again a radical
sectarian group.

00:36:43.489 --> 00:36:46.269
These are people who see
themselves as a community set

00:36:46.269 --> 00:36:47.530
apart from the cosmos.
 

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:50.041
The cosmos is a place of
darkness and a place of the

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:51.570
devil and that sort of thing.
 

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:55.309
In fact--so now what is the
cause of this radical

00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:56.480
sectarianism?
 

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.039
This is the most interesting
problem of the letter.

00:36:59.039 --> 00:37:04.199
Look at 2:18:
Children, it is the last hour.

00:37:04.199 --> 00:37:07.405
As you have heard that the
antichrist is coming,

00:37:07.405 --> 00:37:09.860
so now many antichrists have
come.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:14.110
There are these antichrists,
and notice it says:

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:17.099
They went out from among us but
they did not belong to us.

00:37:17.099 --> 00:37:20.456
For if they had belonged to us
they would have remained in us,

00:37:20.456 --> 00:37:23.759
but by going out they made it
plain that none of them belongs

00:37:23.759 --> 00:37:24.309
to us.
 

00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:28.920
The people he's calling
antichrist are people that used

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:34.213
to members of his own community
and they left the community for

00:37:34.213 --> 00:37:35.579
some reason.
 

00:37:35.579 --> 00:37:39.215
Now look at 2:22,
"Who is the liar but the

00:37:39.215 --> 00:37:43.010
one who denies that Jesus is the
Christ."

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:45.893
He's saying you must believe
that Jesus is the Messiah,

00:37:45.893 --> 00:37:48.190
that's one thing,
is that the only thing?

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:50.400
Not necessarily;
this is the antichrist,

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.469
"The one who denies the
Father and the Son,"

00:37:53.469 --> 00:37:55.306
so some people,
he's saying,

00:37:55.306 --> 00:37:58.994
have left the community because
their Christology is not high

00:37:58.994 --> 00:37:59.610
enough.
 

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:02.135
They're not allowing the true
sonship of Jesus,

00:38:02.135 --> 00:38:04.768
they're not allowing the
Messiahship of Jesus;

00:38:04.768 --> 00:38:07.768
maybe you're saying he's just a
prophet or he's just a human

00:38:07.768 --> 00:38:10.309
being, that's one of the things
that's going on.

00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:14.728
Look at 5:1:
Everyone who believes that

00:38:14.728 --> 00:38:17.280
Jesus is the Christ has been
born of God.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.940
Everyone who loves the parent
loves the child.

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:23.804
That's the main part about
Jesus being the Christ,

00:38:23.804 --> 00:38:27.746
but now look at 4:2,
I'll start at the beginning of

00:38:27.746 --> 00:38:30.326
chapter 4:
Beloved, do not believe every

00:38:30.326 --> 00:38:33.213
spirit but test the spirits to
see whether they are from God,

00:38:33.213 --> 00:38:35.909
for many false prophets have
gone out into the world.

00:38:35.909 --> 00:38:40.329
By this you know the spirit of
God: every spirit that confesses

00:38:40.329 --> 00:38:44.250
that Jesus Christ has come in
the flesh is from God,

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:48.018
and every spirit that does not
confess Jesus is not from God,

00:38:48.018 --> 00:38:51.130
and this is the spirit of the
antichrist.

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:53.911
One of the things that's going
on here--look at also 5:8,

00:38:53.911 --> 00:38:55.650
just briefly,
and we'll move on:

00:39:01.139 --> 00:39:03.882
These are three that testified:
the spirit and the water and

00:39:03.882 --> 00:39:04.440
the blood.
 

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.639
And these three agree.
 

00:39:05.639 --> 00:39:08.202
In other words,
this author is objecting to

00:39:08.202 --> 00:39:11.619
some people who don't admit the
Messiahship of Jesus,

00:39:11.619 --> 00:39:13.710
and that may have been
reflected also in the Gospel.

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:15.635
Remember some of the
reasons--some of the people

00:39:15.635 --> 00:39:18.134
there's a division is because
the writer of the Gospel of John

00:39:18.134 --> 00:39:20.755
believes that some people aren't
willing to confess that Jesus is

00:39:20.755 --> 00:39:22.335
divine,
that Jesus is the Messiah,

00:39:22.335 --> 00:39:23.340
that he's the Son of God.
 

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:25.150
Now we get to a different
situation,

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:28.315
apparently there are other
people who have now come up in

00:39:28.315 --> 00:39:31.253
the community who may be
accepting that Jesus was the

00:39:31.253 --> 00:39:34.420
Christ but they're denying that
he was fully human,

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:35.869
they're denying that he was
flesh and blood,

00:39:35.869 --> 00:39:38.538
and actually we do see
different beginnings of

00:39:38.538 --> 00:39:40.079
different Christologies.
 

00:39:40.079 --> 00:39:42.690
The people--we have a term for
this,

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:47.260
these early Christians who
said--they said that Jesus--

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.166
maybe there was a human Jesus
but that's not really the

00:39:49.166 --> 00:39:52.032
Christ,
the Christ was this spirit that

00:39:52.032 --> 00:39:56.101
maybe looked like he was human--
in fact some of them said,

00:39:56.101 --> 00:39:58.882
well if he walked along a wet
beach he wouldn't leave

00:39:58.882 --> 00:40:01.505
footprints because he didn't
have a physical body,

00:40:01.505 --> 00:40:02.789
he just was spirit.
 

00:40:02.789 --> 00:40:07.875
He just seemed to be a body,
he seemed to be flesh and blood

00:40:07.875 --> 00:40:09.971
and that--
the Greek word for

00:40:09.971 --> 00:40:12.268
"seem"
he just looked like,

00:40:12.268 --> 00:40:15.650
we get this term we call
Docetics.

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:24.639
Dokeo is the Greek word
for "to seem"

00:40:24.639 --> 00:40:28.307
or "to look like,"
so other Christians used this

00:40:28.307 --> 00:40:31.590
term as a label for those
Christians who said,

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:33.489
Jesus wasn't truly flesh and
blood,

00:40:33.489 --> 00:40:35.179
because how can a divine being
be flesh and blood?

00:40:35.179 --> 00:40:36.690
That's a contradiction in terms.
 

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:39.722
You can't have a being that's
both God and flesh and blood

00:40:39.722 --> 00:40:42.650
because flesh and blood rots and
dies, and goes away.

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:45.235
God is eternal,
so God by definition can't be

00:40:45.235 --> 00:40:47.175
flesh and blood,
and so they said,

00:40:47.175 --> 00:40:50.760
if Jesus is divine he must not
have been flesh and blood.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.340
He must have just seemed like
he was flesh and blood.

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:57.402
Other Christians said,
that's wrong and they call

00:40:57.402 --> 00:41:00.619
these people the
"Seemsters,"

00:41:00.619 --> 00:41:01.719
Docetics.
 

00:41:01.719 --> 00:41:05.668
Docetism refers to a
Christology that says Jesus is

00:41:05.668 --> 00:41:07.672
spirit;
the Christ is spirit,

00:41:07.672 --> 00:41:10.010
but not really flesh and blood
human.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:13.606
Notice how this author is
arguing against different kinds

00:41:13.606 --> 00:41:17.590
of ideas and it shows a further
split in early Christianity.

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:20.536
You have some people believing
that Jesus was human but not

00:41:20.536 --> 00:41:22.936
fully divine,
other people believing that he

00:41:22.936 --> 00:41:25.159
was so divine that he wasn't
even human,

00:41:25.159 --> 00:41:28.730
and this author is trying to
hold together these two things.

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:31.489
Now how this happened--so
that's what's going on,

00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:34.974
the Gospel--the first letter of
John shows a community that's

00:41:34.974 --> 00:41:38.170
again divided but now it's
divided by some of the people

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:41.250
within its midst going off
because they thought,

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:43.530
you can't have a flesh and
blood God,

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:45.494
and therefore,
if you're going to have Jesus

00:41:45.494 --> 00:41:47.230
as God he can't be flesh and
blood,

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:50.500
so they've left the community.
 

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.630
Let's look at 2 John,
this is a little--

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.862
I'm going to read all the way
through this one because this is

00:41:55.862 --> 00:41:57.391
going--
we need to sort of figure out

00:41:57.391 --> 00:41:58.010
what's going on.
 

00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:59.030
It's a very short letter.
 

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:02.172
"The elder,"
so he calls himself the elder,

00:42:02.172 --> 00:42:04.469
so he doesn't even give us his
name.

00:42:04.469 --> 00:42:06.480
The elder to the elect lady and
her children,

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.528
whom I love in the truth,
and not only I but also all who

00:42:09.528 --> 00:42:11.976
know the truth,
because of the truth that

00:42:11.976 --> 00:42:14.619
abides in us and will be with us
forever ...

00:42:14.619 --> 00:42:17.300
I was overjoyed to find some of
your children walking in the

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.710
truth just as we have been
commanded by the Father.

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:21.726
He's talking to an elect lady
and her children,

00:42:21.726 --> 00:42:24.005
most of us think this is a
metaphor and he's actually

00:42:24.005 --> 00:42:25.409
addressing this to a church.
 

00:42:25.409 --> 00:42:27.831
The elect lady probably means
the church itself,

00:42:27.831 --> 00:42:30.715
not a particular human person,
but that's just a judgment

00:42:30.715 --> 00:42:31.179
call.
 

00:42:31.179 --> 00:42:34.068
But now, dear lady,
I ask you not as though I were

00:42:34.068 --> 00:42:37.309
writing to you a new commandment
but one we had from the

00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:39.610
beginning, let us love one
another.

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:41.748
There's that love thing,
so we're know we're still in

00:42:41.748 --> 00:42:44.260
the same kind of Christianity
that we were with the others.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.757
This is love,
that we walk according to his

00:42:46.757 --> 00:42:48.731
commandments;
this is the commandment that

00:42:48.731 --> 00:42:50.199
you have heard from the
beginning ...

00:42:50.199 --> 00:42:52.780
Many deceivers have gone out
into the world,

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:56.199
those who do not confess that
Jesus Christ has come in the

00:42:56.199 --> 00:42:56.800
flesh.
 

00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:00.190
[There are those people again.]
Any such person is the deceiver

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:01.340
and the antichrist.
 

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:04.389
Be on your guard so that you do
not lose what we have worked for

00:43:04.389 --> 00:43:05.940
but may receive a full reward.
 

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.876
Everyone who does not abide in
the teaching of Christ but goes

00:43:08.876 --> 00:43:10.320
beyond it does not have God.
 

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.280
Whoever abides in the teaching
has both the Father and the Son.

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.878
Do not receive into the house
or welcome anyone who comes to

00:43:16.878 --> 00:43:19.320
you and does not bring this
teaching,

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:22.094
for to welcome is to
participate in the evil deeds of

00:43:22.094 --> 00:43:22.949
such a person.
 

00:43:22.949 --> 00:43:26.489
The main purpose of this very
short letter is to say,

00:43:26.489 --> 00:43:29.235
to another church that's in the
same kind of community with this

00:43:29.235 --> 00:43:30.942
one,
there are people who have left

00:43:30.942 --> 00:43:33.701
our community and the reason is
they don't believe Jesus was

00:43:33.701 --> 00:43:34.869
fully flesh and blood.
 

00:43:34.869 --> 00:43:37.710
Don't even let them come to
visit you,

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:39.639
these are traveling preachers,
and he says,

00:43:39.639 --> 00:43:41.280
don't receive them,
don't give them money,

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.324
don't give them food,
don't put them up in your guest

00:43:43.324 --> 00:43:45.686
room,
just completely shun them,

00:43:45.686 --> 00:43:49.699
so he's writing to another
church because of this.

00:43:49.699 --> 00:43:52.445
Now look at 3 John:
"The elder to the beloved

00:43:52.445 --> 00:43:55.190
Gaius," now it's the same
person writing,

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:57.090
he says, but now it's to a man
named Gaius,

00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:59.469
not to the elect lady.
 

00:43:59.469 --> 00:44:02.369
I pray that all may go with
you, in good health ...

00:44:02.369 --> 00:44:05.364
Beloved, you do faithfully
whatever you do for the friends,

00:44:05.364 --> 00:44:07.429
even though they are strangers
to you.

00:44:07.429 --> 00:44:09.010
They have testified to your
love before the church.

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:12.610
You will do well to send them
on in a manner worthy of God,

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:15.217
for they began their journey
for the sake of Christ accepting

00:44:15.217 --> 00:44:16.610
no support from non-believers.
 

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:18.559
This is a letter that has been
sent around,

00:44:18.559 --> 00:44:21.159
probably with other traveling
preachers,

00:44:21.159 --> 00:44:24.668
but these traveling preachers
seem to be representatives of

00:44:24.668 --> 00:44:26.829
the elder himself,
the author.

00:44:26.829 --> 00:44:28.923
He's writing to a man named
Gaius and says,

00:44:28.923 --> 00:44:31.168
you're a good guy,
you receive our messengers,

00:44:31.168 --> 00:44:34.309
you receive the people that
we're sending around to preach.

00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:36.204
"I have written something
to the church"

00:44:36.204 --> 00:44:38.204
--
oh he did write a letter to the

00:44:38.204 --> 00:44:40.324
church,
so now you see he wrote another

00:44:40.324 --> 00:44:42.956
letter to the church,
he's writing this letter to an

00:44:42.956 --> 00:44:43.539
individual.
 

00:44:43.539 --> 00:44:47.396
"But Diotrephes,
who likes to put himself first,

00:44:47.396 --> 00:44:50.139
does not acknowledge our
authority.

00:44:50.139 --> 00:44:52.070
So if I come"--in other
words,

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:56.152
Diotrephes seems to be the
leader of a church and has not

00:44:56.152 --> 00:45:00.090
allowed the elder to send his
letter to that church.

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:03.579
He's intercepting letters and
not allowing these things to be

00:45:03.579 --> 00:45:05.150
read aloud in the church.
 

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:07.239
All these letters were supposed
to be read aloud in churches.

00:45:07.239 --> 00:45:10.746
If I come I will call attention
to what he is doing in spreading

00:45:10.746 --> 00:45:12.250
false charges against us.
 

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:14.867
And not content with these
charges, he refuses to welcome

00:45:14.867 --> 00:45:17.483
the friends and even prevents
those who want to do so and

00:45:17.483 --> 00:45:18.980
expels them from the church.
 

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:24.262
Diotrephes is refusing to
welcome the messengers from the

00:45:24.262 --> 00:45:30.112
elder that the elder sent ahead
of himself with the letter that

00:45:30.112 --> 00:45:32.000
makes up 2 John.
 

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.380
You see what's going on here?
 

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:36.699
There's a leader of this
Johannine church,

00:45:36.699 --> 00:45:39.190
probably after the writing of
the Gospel,

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:41.030
probably after the writing of 1
John,

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:44.313
and he writes 2 John as a sort
of introductory letter to a

00:45:44.313 --> 00:45:45.672
church,
and he says,

00:45:45.672 --> 00:45:48.280
I'm sending you some of my
messengers,

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.760
receive them,
listen to the letter,

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.699
give them what they need,
help them out financially,

00:45:52.699 --> 00:45:55.646
put them up in your guest room,
and then send them on their way

00:45:55.646 --> 00:45:58.309
so they can travel around to
other Christian churches.

00:45:58.309 --> 00:46:01.989
Something's gone wrong though,
maybe this is a different--

00:46:01.989 --> 00:46:04.309
maybe 3 John--we don't know,
this is speculation,

00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:08.476
maybe 3 John is another letter
that he had to write to an

00:46:08.476 --> 00:46:12.420
individual in that town because
2 John didn't work.

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:13.768
Why?
 

00:46:13.768 --> 00:46:16.123
It may be that those people
disagreed with him about his

00:46:16.123 --> 00:46:18.838
Christology also,
so they may have received the

00:46:18.838 --> 00:46:22.170
very people that he thought they
shouldn't receive.

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:26.329
And so he writes 3 John to an
individual saying,

00:46:26.329 --> 00:46:29.563
Diotrephes is causing a bunch
of problems not receiving my

00:46:29.563 --> 00:46:33.079
messengers and not allowing my
letters to be read in church.

00:46:33.079 --> 00:46:36.679
You see how this
represents--this is all guess

00:46:36.679 --> 00:46:37.239
work.
 

00:46:37.239 --> 00:46:40.806
We don't know what's going on
but we see several things about

00:46:40.806 --> 00:46:41.579
the letter.
 

00:46:41.579 --> 00:46:43.929
There's a greeting,
there are well wishes,

00:46:43.929 --> 00:46:46.503
there's praise of the
reputation and behavior of the

00:46:46.503 --> 00:46:49.092
recipients,
he attempts to establish a

00:46:49.092 --> 00:46:51.717
relationship,
he talks to this person--he's

00:46:51.717 --> 00:46:54.847
the father's son or a patron
client relationship and there's

00:46:54.847 --> 00:46:56.440
a letter of recommendation.
 

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:58.021
Send them on,
this is what you do in the

00:46:58.021 --> 00:46:59.764
ancient world,
you give a messenger--there's

00:46:59.764 --> 00:47:00.900
no post office you know.
 

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:04.208
You give a letter to someone
who's traveling and that person

00:47:04.208 --> 00:47:06.789
gets to a friend of yours to
where it says,

00:47:06.789 --> 00:47:09.150
and they show the letter,
that letter is read outside--

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:12.492
read aloud to the group,
and then you put that person up

00:47:12.492 --> 00:47:15.244
or those people up,
you host them for a while,

00:47:15.244 --> 00:47:17.420
they talk and you share your
messages,

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.360
and then you send them on--you
give them a little bit of

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.510
financial support to send them
on their way to the rest of the

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.900
travel.
 

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:25.036
That's clearly what is going on
and both of these letters are

00:47:25.036 --> 00:47:27.335
letters of recommendation,
typical letters of

00:47:27.335 --> 00:47:28.329
recommendation.
 

00:47:28.329 --> 00:47:33.994
What makes it interesting is
that 2 John seems to have been a

00:47:33.994 --> 00:47:38.809
letter of recommendation that
didn't work, maybe.

00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:42.666
And then 3 John had to be
written to an individual because

00:47:42.666 --> 00:47:46.320
his letter couldn't get through
to the whole church.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:50.050
What's the cause of this
division?

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:53.722
Clearly the cause of division
in the Gospel of John is that

00:47:53.722 --> 00:47:57.460
some people are not accepting a
high enough Christology,

00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:59.809
they're not accepting that
Jesus is truly divine.

00:47:59.809 --> 00:48:02.958
They might be accepting that
Jesus is human but not that he

00:48:02.958 --> 00:48:03.610
is divine.
 

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:07.530
The situation has shifted
slightly by the time we get to

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:09.902
the 1 John,
the letter, because there it

00:48:09.902 --> 00:48:12.744
seems like yes he's talked about
some people are antichrist

00:48:12.744 --> 00:48:15.539
because they've denied that
Jesus is the Messiah but other

00:48:15.539 --> 00:48:18.331
people are antichrist because
they've denied that Jesus is

00:48:18.331 --> 00:48:18.969
flesh.
 

00:48:18.969 --> 00:48:22.139
He says they have gone out from
among us,

00:48:22.139 --> 00:48:25.521
so the church has been split
again on the issue of

00:48:25.521 --> 00:48:29.318
Christology but now the
Christology is do you accept the

00:48:29.318 --> 00:48:33.025
full fleshness of Jesus,
but then when you get to 2 John

00:48:33.025 --> 00:48:36.710
and 3 John,
the split--is the split now

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:37.920
doctrinal?
 

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.670
Is it Christological?
 

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:42.920
Or is this just a split over
who gets to be the leader?

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:46.039
Who gets to be the recognized
leader of these churches?

00:48:46.039 --> 00:48:48.018
Is it the elder?
 

00:48:48.018 --> 00:48:51.630
Do his letters have to be
accepted and his emissaries get

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:53.760
accepted in different churches?
 

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.730
Or is it this guy Diotrephes?
 

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:58.530
Is he sort of trying to buck
the elder for the leadership?

00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:01.690
Is there a dispute over
Christology?

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:04.686
Do they disagree about
Christology or is it now a

00:49:04.686 --> 00:49:07.059
purely a personnel leadership
issue?

00:49:07.059 --> 00:49:11.641
It's very difficult to see but
you can very quickly see by

00:49:11.641 --> 00:49:15.260
looking at these four different
documents,

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:18.619
the Gospel of John,
1 John, 2 John,

00:49:18.619 --> 00:49:21.878
3 John, four different
documents which may have been

00:49:21.878 --> 00:49:23.867
written in the--
not by the same person,

00:49:23.867 --> 00:49:25.909
we don't think they're all
written by the same person,

00:49:25.909 --> 00:49:28.108
but they're clearly written by
the same school of early

00:49:28.108 --> 00:49:28.719
Christianity.
 

00:49:28.719 --> 00:49:30.949
They share enough the
vocabulary and enough theology.

00:49:30.949 --> 00:49:34.358
You can almost see four
different stages of development

00:49:34.358 --> 00:49:36.570
and you see what we might
expect.

00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:38.974
Remember I said that in growing
up in Texas we always said

00:49:38.974 --> 00:49:41.380
"let's make like a Baptist
church and split."

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:46.402
Early churches also seem to
split a lot, is that what we see

00:49:46.402 --> 00:49:47.000
here?
 

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.021
Four different stages of a
church with different kinds of

00:49:50.021 --> 00:49:52.503
divisions happening and,
therefore different,

00:49:52.503 --> 00:49:54.753
kinds of Christianity
developing due to these

00:49:54.753 --> 00:49:57.070
divisions;
very possible.

00:49:57.070 --> 00:49:59.360
Any questions about that?
 

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:01.250
Questions, comments, outbursts?
 

00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:06.103
Now what I've just given you is
one reading of these texts,

00:50:06.103 --> 00:50:09.199
and I've done a lot of
speculating.

00:50:09.199 --> 00:50:10.492
For example,
you could just say,

00:50:10.492 --> 00:50:12.869
well 2 John may have been
written to one church and 3 John

00:50:12.869 --> 00:50:15.329
is written to a totally
different geographical region,

00:50:15.329 --> 00:50:16.518
that's entirely possible.
 

00:50:16.518 --> 00:50:19.561
I think it's interesting to put
them in this way and read them

00:50:19.561 --> 00:50:21.501
this way,
but that's just one historical

00:50:21.501 --> 00:50:24.409
reconstruction because a lot of
what I'm teaching you is let's--

00:50:24.409 --> 00:50:27.280
how do you imagine history
developing if all you have are

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.947
these texts by which you
construct the history of the

00:50:29.947 --> 00:50:30.820
early church?
 

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:34.067
Next time we're going to shift
gears dramatically because now

00:50:34.067 --> 00:50:37.260
we're not going to be talking
about the historical situation

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:39.914
of the text,
we're going to be talking about

00:50:39.914 --> 00:50:43.382
how do you get through all these
texts to try to figure out the

00:50:43.382 --> 00:50:44.949
historical Jesus himself?
 

00:50:44.949 --> 00:50:47.699
Did Jesus of Nazareth really
exist?

00:50:47.699 --> 00:50:49.820
What did he do?
 

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:50.849
What did he say?
 

00:50:50.849 --> 00:50:52.849
What did he think of himself?
 

00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:55.150
That's what we'll talk about
next time.

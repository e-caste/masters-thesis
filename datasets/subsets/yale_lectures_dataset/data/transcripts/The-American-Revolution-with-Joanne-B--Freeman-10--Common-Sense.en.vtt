00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.558
Prof: Okay.
 

00:00:03.558 --> 00:00:07.890
Today we are going to be
discussing certainly one of the

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.830
biggest bestsellers in early
American history,

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.920
and that's Thomas Paine's
pamphlet Common Sense.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.800
Before I plunge in to Common
Sense,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.272
I am going to answer the
question that was asked from

00:00:21.272 --> 00:00:23.690
this section of the room on
Tuesday,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.880
about how do you vote on
voting--the little brain teaser

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.620
of the Continental Congress.
 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.990
And I found the answer to this
question.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.236
Okay.
 

00:00:30.236 --> 00:00:33.149
So the answer to the question
is: they actually had a pretty

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.567
animated debate in the
Continental Congress on the

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:38.634
whole voting question,
and some people said it should

00:00:38.634 --> 00:00:41.050
be according to population and
some said,

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.027
'Well, you should put property
in with population,' and some

00:00:44.027 --> 00:00:46.720
people said one colony,
one vote.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.090
And with--after apparently
arguing for quite some time,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.750
what they realized was they
actually really didn't have an

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.540
orderly way to figure out
population and property worth,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.038
[laughter]
and so they ultimately just

00:00:58.038 --> 00:01:00.392
decided one colony,
one vote, [laughs]

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:02.829
--like, that's all we can do.
 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.799
And they were really concerned
because they didn't want that to

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:05.340
be a precedent.
 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.634
They were all worried that
they'd be setting a precedent

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:08.260
for all time.
 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.290
So when they wrote it down in
the minutes,

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.110
they said, we're deciding one
colony,

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.572
one vote, but not with the idea
that it will be a precedent for

00:01:14.572 --> 00:01:15.010
all time.
 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.614
Of course, it then becomes a
precedent for Congress under the

00:01:17.614 --> 00:01:18.830
Articles of Confederation.
 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.938
But the answer to the
question--how did they vote?--

00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:23.540
is apparently someone made a
motion--

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.860
'I make a motion that we just
do the one colony,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.605
one vote thing'--and people
just voted on the motion as a

00:01:30.605 --> 00:01:31.140
group.
 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.509
So that is the answer to the
question: How do you vote on

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:33.890
voting?
 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.649
I had not thought about it
before and yet historians have

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.620
addressed it so there you go
so--Okay.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.500
That is the answer to the
question.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.358
On to Common Sense,
which really,

00:01:43.358 --> 00:01:46.290
truly unquestionably was a
bestseller.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.339
It actually sold over 120,000
copies in its first few months

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:54.791
in print,
and a little bit later in the

00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:57.400
lecture I'm going to give you a
sense of how that compares with

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.970
how some other things might have
sold in this time period.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.575
You'll really get a sense of
what kind of a bestseller this

00:02:03.575 --> 00:02:03.950
was.
 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.991
And certainly many scholars
consider it to be the most

00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:09.860
brilliant political pamphlet of
the Revolution,

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.357
not necessarily for the
subtlety of its argument but

00:02:12.357 --> 00:02:14.610
certainly for the way in which
it's argued,

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.590
and I'll talk more about that
in the course of the lecture.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.580
So what we're going to be
looking at is the pamphlet

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.688
itself and what specifically
made it so remarkable.

00:02:23.688 --> 00:02:27.014
And then we're also going to
look some at its author,

00:02:27.014 --> 00:02:29.699
Thomas Paine,
who he was and how he came to

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.128
produce this influential
pamphlet.

00:02:32.128 --> 00:02:35.878
But I actually want to begin
with something that I just--

00:02:35.878 --> 00:02:39.128
in my head when I think about
Thomas Paine I think about this,

00:02:39.128 --> 00:02:41.250
so I feel like I can't start
this lecture without discussing

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.430
it.
 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.663
And that has to do with the
death of Thomas Paine or

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:48.340
actually, to be more accurate,
the body of Thomas Paine.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.657
Okay.
 

00:02:48.657 --> 00:02:52.610
It's one of the sad ironies of
history that this person who--

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.013
all through this lecture I'm
going to be talking about the

00:02:55.013 --> 00:02:57.241
great influence of his pamphlet,
had this great influence

00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:59.760
throughout the Revolution--
and he actually died pretty

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.921
much poor and not very much
liked by Americans of all

00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:05.522
political stripes,
more having to do with his

00:03:05.522 --> 00:03:08.389
politics later in his life than
what he was doing during the

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.169
Revolution,
but he was not a happy camper

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:13.080
in the years of his death.
 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.044
But the most horrifying thing
about Paine's death has to do

00:03:16.044 --> 00:03:17.680
with the question of his body.
 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.058
Okay.
 

00:03:18.058 --> 00:03:21.853
So Paine first asked about
being buried in a Quaker

00:03:21.853 --> 00:03:24.358
cemetery,
and the Quakers weren't very

00:03:24.358 --> 00:03:27.664
excited about that because they
were not really hoping to have

00:03:27.664 --> 00:03:31.188
that cemetery become a tourist
attraction so that didn't work.

00:03:31.188 --> 00:03:35.400
So he basically ended up at
first being buried on his small

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.360
farm in upstate New York.
 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.287
A few years later a newspaper
editor named William Cobbett

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:45.491
decided that what he was going
to do was disinter the body and

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:49.413
take it back to England,
and then in England they would

00:03:49.413 --> 00:03:51.660
set up a memorial to Thomas
Paine.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.979
This was his plan.
 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.060
So he did.
 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.979
He disinterred the body;
he went on a boat;

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.758
he and dead-body Paine went
sailing back to England.

00:03:59.758 --> 00:04:02.760
Got back to England,
raised the issue and apparently

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.175
did not get very much support
for the idea of a memorial of

00:04:06.175 --> 00:04:07.000
some kind.
 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.408
At this point it gets a little
sad.

00:04:10.408 --> 00:04:10.675
Okay.
 

00:04:10.675 --> 00:04:13.605
So not knowing what else to
do--and why at this point he

00:04:13.605 --> 00:04:15.949
didn't think to bury him
someplace else,

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:20.468
I don't know--but apparently he
had the bones put in a trunk and

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:23.050
kept them on his farm for a
while.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.386
Okay.
 

00:04:23.386 --> 00:04:26.750
So, body of Paine sitting on
his farm in England.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.447
Then he died--Mr. Cobbett
died and the trunk and Paine was

00:04:31.447 --> 00:04:35.096
passed on to his son,
and then his son I guess went

00:04:35.096 --> 00:04:37.797
into debt in some way and his
belongings began to get

00:04:37.797 --> 00:04:40.913
auctioned off and the person
doing the auctioning didn't want

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:43.769
to have anything to do with
auctioning off a body.

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:46.476
Like, I've never auctioned off
a body before,

00:04:46.476 --> 00:04:50.105
I don't want anything to do
with this--and basically Paine's

00:04:50.105 --> 00:04:51.519
corpse disappeared.
 

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:54.879
We really do not know where
Thomas Paine is.

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:59.646
Truly, there was a trunk and it
had Paine in it and then it

00:04:59.646 --> 00:05:00.550
vanished.
 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.990
And I went searching today
before I gave this lecture,

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.925
trying to figure out
like--okay, maybe there's been a

00:05:06.925 --> 00:05:09.920
recent development in the search
for Thomas Paine,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.629
the corpse, and no actually.
 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:15.968
Although I did discover that in
2001 there was a society that

00:05:15.968 --> 00:05:19.141
wanted to create some kind of
memorial here in America and

00:05:19.141 --> 00:05:22.314
they decided that they were
going to try to trace the body

00:05:22.314 --> 00:05:24.930
so they set out trying to trace
the body.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.370
What they found was,
all over the world are people

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.411
who claim to have a piece of
Thomas Paine,

00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:29.910
right?
 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.170
Well, his skull might be in
Australia but his leg--that

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.500
might be in England.
 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.317
So the sort of--the horrifying
end to Thomas Paine is his body

00:05:37.317 --> 00:05:39.903
disappeared and perhaps little
pieces of Thomas Paine are

00:05:39.903 --> 00:05:42.490
floating around as little relics
all over the world.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.209
So that's Paine's sort of weird
ending,

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:49.416
certainly not the kind of
ending that you would wish for

00:05:49.416 --> 00:05:52.680
the person who has written the
pamphlet we're going to be

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.079
talking about today.
 

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:57.156
And we are given that--what he
ended up writing was so

00:05:57.156 --> 00:06:00.348
influential and so different
from much of what was being

00:06:00.348 --> 00:06:01.800
written at this time.
 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.406
Now as I said at the outset,
it's not the great subtleties

00:06:06.406 --> 00:06:09.720
of its argument that made it
stand out.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.470
And in fact its popularity was
due to the very things that were

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.072
its greatest strengths:
the fact that it was

00:06:16.072 --> 00:06:18.918
passionate,
the fact that it had a really

00:06:18.918 --> 00:06:21.889
simple style,
that it spoke to the common

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:26.108
man, that it captured and
completely overturned prevailing

00:06:26.108 --> 00:06:30.182
colonial ideas about the
relationship between the mother

00:06:30.182 --> 00:06:33.069
country and the American
colonies.

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:37.151
As someone wrote at the time,
Paine spoke a language which

00:06:37.151 --> 00:06:40.160
the colonists had felt,
but not thought.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.055
One of the remarkable things
about the pamphlet is that it

00:06:44.055 --> 00:06:47.884
was written by a somewhat
bankrupt English corset-maker a

00:06:47.884 --> 00:06:51.711
mere fourteen months after he
had arrived in America from

00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:52.670
England.
 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.410
Basically speaking,
Paine knew relatively little

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.500
about colonial affairs when he
decided to write it.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.410
He wasn't really an established
writer.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.709
He had done writing before.
 

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:05.586
I'll talk a little bit about
this today, but he wasn't this

00:07:05.586 --> 00:07:07.769
sort of well-known and
established writer.

00:07:07.769 --> 00:07:08.790
He wrote some for newspapers.
 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:13.113
And actually the idea for the
pamphlet initially wasn't really

00:07:13.113 --> 00:07:13.540
his.
 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.661
He wrote it at the
encouragement of Dr. Benjamin

00:07:16.661 --> 00:07:17.259
Rush.
 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:19.937
I mentioned that in the first
lecture, and I'm going to come

00:07:19.937 --> 00:07:20.800
back to that too.
 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.720
So Paine is relatively new to
the colonies,

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.404
not really an established
writer, so how is it that he

00:07:27.404 --> 00:07:29.769
ends up writing this pamphlet?
 

00:07:29.769 --> 00:07:34.660
Well, more than anything else
it actually was Paine's

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:40.019
experience of events in the
colonies between 1775 and 1776

00:07:40.019 --> 00:07:43.029
that inspired what he wrote.
 

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:47.281
Now let's look for a moment
at--to see here what Paine is

00:07:47.281 --> 00:07:51.610
experiencing in that year before
he wrote the pamphlet.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.810
What is happening around him.
 

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.334
I'm going to talk about this
really briefly here because I'll

00:07:56.334 --> 00:07:58.480
be talking in more detail about
this on Tuesday,

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.600
but one thing I will mention
here very briefly is,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.240
part of what happens between
1775 and 1776 is the meeting of

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.338
the Second Continental Congress.
 

00:08:07.338 --> 00:08:11.160
And that actually begins
meeting in the spring of 1775.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.800
I'll talk about the details of
the Congress Tuesday.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.930
For now, I'll just talk about
the general mindset.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.839
For one thing,
no colony instructed its

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:24.127
delegates to this Second
Continental Congress to work for

00:08:24.127 --> 00:08:25.430
independence.
 

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.519
That was not the agenda.
 

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:30.500
Delegates were pretty much
still acting under the

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.410
assumption that they were trying
to force Parliament or the King

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:38.011
or someone to acknowledge their
liberties and redress their

00:08:38.011 --> 00:08:41.086
grievances,
and the overall assumption

00:08:41.086 --> 00:08:45.601
still was that balance had been
thrown off within the British

00:08:45.601 --> 00:08:49.139
constitution and it needed to be
rebalanced.

00:08:49.139 --> 00:08:51.634
So they're talking about trying
to figure out a way of balancing

00:08:51.634 --> 00:08:53.231
things,
maybe a new balance,

00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:56.538
but they're not talking about
throwing the entire system

00:08:56.538 --> 00:08:57.080
aside.
 

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.605
Actually, in the minds of many
at the time they probably were

00:09:00.605 --> 00:09:03.423
thinking,
why destroy what had for a very

00:09:03.423 --> 00:09:07.582
long time been one of the most
successful political empires in

00:09:07.582 --> 00:09:08.470
the world.
 

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.831
John Adams noted in his diary
at the opening of the Second

00:09:11.831 --> 00:09:15.309
Continental Congress that at
what he called an "elegant

00:09:15.309 --> 00:09:18.200
supper" at the opening of
the Congress,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.678
many representatives and their
friends toasted,

00:09:20.678 --> 00:09:23.422
quote, "the Union of
Britain and the Colonies on a

00:09:23.422 --> 00:09:25.149
constitutional foundation."
 

00:09:25.149 --> 00:09:25.469
Okay.
 

00:09:25.469 --> 00:09:29.178
So that's what they're hoping
for as this Congress opens.

00:09:29.178 --> 00:09:33.899
As an example of this initial
mindset of the Congress--

00:09:33.899 --> 00:09:37.456
again more about this
Tuesday--moderates attempted one

00:09:37.456 --> 00:09:41.820
last stab at some kind of basic
reconciliation with the Crown,

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.787
and they issued what came to be
known as the Olive Branch

00:09:44.787 --> 00:09:45.370
Petition.
 

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.690
It failed for a number of
reasons--again more next week--

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.712
one of the most basic reasons
being the King refused to read

00:09:52.712 --> 00:09:55.827
the Olive Branch Petition,
which pretty much is the way to

00:09:55.827 --> 00:09:57.769
guarantee the failure of a
petition.

00:09:57.769 --> 00:10:00.418
By doing that,
the King basically gave some

00:10:00.418 --> 00:10:03.889
credence to the views of the
more radical members of the

00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:07.734
Continental Congress,
and radicals got even more

00:10:07.734 --> 00:10:12.076
credence on August 23,
1775, when the King issued a

00:10:12.076 --> 00:10:17.100
proclamation that declared the
colonies to be in rebellion,

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:22.812
and then made plans to send
20,000 British troops to the

00:10:22.812 --> 00:10:26.350
colonies,
including Prussian mercenaries.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:29.452
Okay, a big change in things,
much more detail Tuesday,

00:10:29.452 --> 00:10:32.611
but this is important to the
setting of Common Sense.

00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:34.605
So the King ignores the Olive

00:10:34.605 --> 00:10:35.470
Branch Petition.
 

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:38.264
He's sending troops,
not just any troops but

00:10:38.264 --> 00:10:41.514
literally hired guns,
right?--foreign hired guns to

00:10:41.514 --> 00:10:43.009
go to the colonies.
 

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:46.909
So the colonies have now been
declared in rebellion.

00:10:46.909 --> 00:10:47.840
An army is coming.
 

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.139
At this point the colonists
realize that they need to maybe

00:10:51.139 --> 00:10:54.211
take some form of action and
make some kind of military

00:10:54.211 --> 00:10:57.226
preparation,
not in an aggressive way but

00:10:57.226 --> 00:10:59.418
certainly in a defensive way.
 

00:10:59.418 --> 00:11:03.799
Even as they began to do this
and try to stock up on military

00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:06.940
supplies and engage in militia
training,

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.458
still a lot of colonists
considered it pretty unlikely

00:11:10.458 --> 00:11:12.850
that a string of relatively
weak--

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.572
prosperous as they
were--colonies could hope to

00:11:16.572 --> 00:11:19.903
defeat England,
the most powerful nation on

00:11:19.903 --> 00:11:20.389
earth.
 

00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:24.316
And even if they did
miraculously somehow manage to

00:11:24.316 --> 00:11:26.600
do that,
certainly also most people in

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.000
the colonies would have assumed
that instantly,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.057
foreign powers would have come
zipping over to North America

00:11:32.057 --> 00:11:35.269
and would have swallowed up
these helpless little colonies,

00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:37.825
and so now instead of belonging
to England they would have

00:11:37.825 --> 00:11:39.440
belonged to France or maybe
Spain.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.370
So certainly things weren't
really feeling really optimistic

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:45.104
at this moment in which things
seemed to be dramatically

00:11:45.104 --> 00:11:47.585
shifting,
and this is the setting in

00:11:47.585 --> 00:11:49.990
which Paine wrote Common
Sense.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.976
In his mind,
the time was right for some

00:11:52.976 --> 00:11:57.354
kind of a drastic change for the
better in the American colonies

00:11:57.354 --> 00:11:58.888
and,
as we'll see,

00:11:58.888 --> 00:12:03.082
instead of just tinkering with
the English constitution Paine

00:12:03.082 --> 00:12:07.438
basically turns his back on it,
rejects King George III,

00:12:07.438 --> 00:12:11.500
rejects Parliament,
and ultimately rejects even the

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.889
idea of monarchy.
 

00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:16.798
So instead of centering on the
British constitution,

00:12:16.798 --> 00:12:21.254
Paine based his ideas about
colonial society and government

00:12:21.254 --> 00:12:25.091
on natural rights logic,
arguing that the colonies

00:12:25.091 --> 00:12:28.899
should join in a new government
grounded on equality.

00:12:28.899 --> 00:12:32.000
Now obviously ideas about
natural rights,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.558
natural rights talk,
isn't new.

00:12:34.558 --> 00:12:39.279
Paine's achievement was to take
those kinds of ideas and in a

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:42.190
sense give them to ordinary
people.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.966
Part of what he argues in his
pamphlet is: this isn't some

00:12:45.966 --> 00:12:48.418
great high constitutional
argument.

00:12:48.418 --> 00:12:52.298
This is about you and me and
life in the colonies.

00:12:52.298 --> 00:12:56.221
And, as we'll see,
in method and in audience and

00:12:56.221 --> 00:13:01.227
in argument--for all of these
reasons, Paine's pamphlet had a

00:13:01.227 --> 00:13:02.480
big impact.
 

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.842
So let's look for a moment at
who this man was who wrote this

00:13:06.842 --> 00:13:08.879
early American bestseller.
 

00:13:08.879 --> 00:13:11.460
Well, he was relatively poor.
 

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.538
He was never really well off.
 

00:13:13.538 --> 00:13:15.433
Obviously, he was an
intelligent--strikingly

00:13:15.433 --> 00:13:16.360
intelligent person.
 

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.639
He was someone who loved to
assert his own importance.

00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:21.528
He loved to brag about his
great accomplishments.

00:13:21.528 --> 00:13:24.149
He loved to dominate a
conversation.

00:13:24.149 --> 00:13:26.702
It's possible towards the end
of his life he may have had a

00:13:26.702 --> 00:13:27.538
drinking problem.
 

00:13:27.538 --> 00:13:29.990
I tried to get authoritative
word on this.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.070
Probably I didn't realize it.
 

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.720
When I'm-- I--Although I've
taught this course before,

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.317
before I give every lecture I
actually go over it and kind of

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:39.874
redo it and then I research
things so before I come to class

00:13:39.874 --> 00:13:41.519
I'm actually having these
random--

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:43.370
It's like a big game of Trivial
Pursuit.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.799
Was Thomas Paine really drunk?
 

00:13:45.799 --> 00:13:47.389
Research, research, research.
 

00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:48.230
Okay. Maybe not so much.
 

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:49.450
What happened to the body?
 

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:50.950
Oh. We still don't know.
 

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:51.990
Okay. Okay.
 

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.866
So I have these weird Trivial
Pursuit moments in preparation

00:13:54.866 --> 00:13:55.940
for the course here.
 

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.854
So, maybe drunk,
maybe not, a slight drinking

00:13:57.854 --> 00:13:58.289
problem.
 

00:13:58.289 --> 00:13:59.788
Historians disagree.
 

00:13:59.788 --> 00:14:03.820
Either way, he was born in
England in 1737.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.269
Supposedly the cottage that he
was born in was literally in the

00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:12.538
shadow of a place of execution,
so the dark hand of the State

00:14:12.538 --> 00:14:15.440
was looming over the cottage of
Thomas Paine.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.450
He was born poor.
 

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:20.158
His father was a stay-maker.
 

00:14:20.158 --> 00:14:23.292
Paine did go to grammar school
and he liked learning,

00:14:23.292 --> 00:14:26.785
but at the age of 12 he was
pulled out to be apprenticed to

00:14:26.785 --> 00:14:27.690
his father.
 

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.318
As a young man,
he had a number of different

00:14:30.318 --> 00:14:30.870
trades.
 

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.110
None of them were enormously
successful.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.058
I think for a little while he
might have been a sailor.

00:14:36.058 --> 00:14:37.798
I think he was a minor
officeholder.

00:14:37.798 --> 00:14:40.830
I think he was an excise man in
England for a little while.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:44.783
In his spare time he liked to
go to public lectures in London,

00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:48.220
and that's where he met men
like Benjamin Franklin.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:53.149
And Franklin ultimately proved
important to Paine,

00:14:53.149 --> 00:14:56.605
because Paine ended up doing
what a lot of sort of vaguely

00:14:56.605 --> 00:14:59.879
rootless people in England might
have decided to do.

00:14:59.879 --> 00:15:02.634
He decided to try his luck in
the American colonies where

00:15:02.634 --> 00:15:05.490
there seemed to be some
opportunity for self-promotion,

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:07.519
for sort of making something of
yourself.

00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:10.427
But before setting off,
Paine did an intelligent thing,

00:15:10.427 --> 00:15:12.528
and that is,
he made an appointment with

00:15:12.528 --> 00:15:13.230
Franklin.
 

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.480
And Franklin did an important
thing.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.870
He wrote a letter of
recommendation for Paine.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.188
And a letter of recommendation
in this period was kind of a

00:15:22.188 --> 00:15:24.616
magical thing because,
if you think about it,

00:15:24.616 --> 00:15:27.471
unlike now where there are five
million ways in which we all can

00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:30.182
check on each other,
there really weren't ways in

00:15:30.182 --> 00:15:33.774
which one person knew anything
about a stranger or could verify

00:15:33.774 --> 00:15:36.440
or check on who some complete
stranger was.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.173
There's a reason why the early
nineteenth century is the age of

00:15:39.173 --> 00:15:39.702
the con man.
 

00:15:39.702 --> 00:15:40.100
Right?
 

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.879
It's really easy for someone to
drift into town,

00:15:41.879 --> 00:15:44.100
claim to be somebody,
no one has a way of checking,

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.192
and then the person can drift
out, taking various amounts of

00:15:47.192 --> 00:15:48.870
money and belongings with him.
 

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:52.020
So letters of recommendation
were kind of magical because

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.509
basically they represented one
person vouching their reputation

00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:56.408
for another.
 

00:15:56.408 --> 00:15:59.613
The person who wrote it said,
'I'm writing this letter for

00:15:59.613 --> 00:16:00.399
Mr. Paine.
 

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:02.732
I, Mr. Franklin,
am writing for Mr. Paine and

00:16:02.732 --> 00:16:05.860
I'm introducing him to your
attention and wish that you will

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.519
introduce yourself to him and
show him around Philadelphia'--

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:11.923
seemingly a basic statement,
but Franklin was basically

00:16:11.923 --> 00:16:13.678
saying,
'I'm--Here's my reputation.

00:16:13.678 --> 00:16:16.797
I'm vouching for this guy so
you could--you can get to know

00:16:16.797 --> 00:16:17.120
him.
 

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.960
You can trust him because I'm
recommending him.'

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.778
So it was a smart move on
Paine's part.

00:16:21.778 --> 00:16:24.065
It was a nice thing for
Franklin to do,

00:16:24.065 --> 00:16:27.732
and in the letter that Franklin
wrote he referred Paine to his

00:16:27.732 --> 00:16:30.558
son-in-law, Richard Bache,
in Philadelphia.

00:16:30.558 --> 00:16:35.798
So Paine arrived in America in
late 1774,

00:16:35.798 --> 00:16:38.926
but apparently the whole
overseas passage was pretty

00:16:38.926 --> 00:16:42.666
horrible so he was pretty much
out of commission until January

00:16:42.666 --> 00:16:44.532
1775,
and at that point when he was

00:16:44.532 --> 00:16:46.918
up and about,
Bache offered to introduce him

00:16:46.918 --> 00:16:49.529
into the local literary and
political scene.

00:16:49.529 --> 00:16:52.070
Now what happened next is a
really good case for the

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.110
importance of serendipity and
the importance of bookstores.

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.524
Okay.
 

00:16:55.524 --> 00:17:00.168
So Paine liked to hang out in
this one local bookstore.

00:17:00.168 --> 00:17:02.370
Apparently he went there every
day.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:02.625
Okay.
 

00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:04.676
That's the local literary
scene--[laughs]

00:17:04.676 --> 00:17:07.319
the bookstore--
and he befriended the owner of

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:10.587
the bookstore and the owner
eventually invited Paine to be

00:17:10.587 --> 00:17:13.798
the editor of a new journal that
he wanted to start,

00:17:13.798 --> 00:17:15.950
that he was calling the
Pennsylvania Magazine.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.367
So Paine wrote for the
Pennsylvania Magazine for

00:17:18.367 --> 00:17:20.876
a while and he wrote a
bunch of different kinds of

00:17:20.876 --> 00:17:21.369
things.
 

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:22.470
He wrote fiction.
 

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:23.829
He wrote essays.
 

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:25.420
He wrote social commentary.
 

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.238
As an example,
he wrote a piece on British

00:17:28.238 --> 00:17:32.018
cruelty in the East Indies and
Africa and against native

00:17:32.018 --> 00:17:34.108
Americans,
writing, quote,

00:17:34.108 --> 00:17:38.275
"When I reflect on these I
hesitate not for a moment to

00:17:38.275 --> 00:17:42.441
believe that the Almighty will
finally separate America from

00:17:42.441 --> 00:17:43.358
Britain.
 

00:17:43.358 --> 00:17:46.838
Call it Independence or what
you will, if it is the cause of

00:17:46.838 --> 00:17:49.140
God and humanity it will go
on."

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.040
Now considering--I'm going to
talk a little bit more about the

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.881
fact that people aren't really
talking about independence at

00:17:52.881 --> 00:17:55.348
this point,
so that's a pretty bold

00:17:55.348 --> 00:17:58.259
statement before Common
Sense.

00:17:58.259 --> 00:18:02.509
Now one thing was noticeable
about Paine's writings.

00:18:02.509 --> 00:18:05.471
And that is that when they
seemed to strike at issues of

00:18:05.471 --> 00:18:07.483
American liberty,
even indirectly,

00:18:07.483 --> 00:18:09.470
even seemingly through
metaphor--

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:12.846
as in one essay that talked
about British domination of

00:18:12.846 --> 00:18:16.411
India but everybody assumed
India must really be the North

00:18:16.411 --> 00:18:19.276
American colonies--
whenever he was referencing any

00:18:19.276 --> 00:18:22.098
of that sort of thing,
sales jumped.

00:18:22.098 --> 00:18:24.720
Everyone wanted to read those
essays.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.637
And ultimately it was some of
those essays that brought Paine

00:18:28.637 --> 00:18:30.990
to the attention of Benjamin
Rush.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.634
Rush went to that same
bookstore, the magical

00:18:33.634 --> 00:18:36.038
bookstore, the center of Paine's
life.

00:18:36.038 --> 00:18:39.038
He happened to meet Paine at
that same bookstore--so the

00:18:39.038 --> 00:18:42.038
moral is it's a good thing to
hang out in bookstores.

00:18:42.038 --> 00:18:46.317
And through their conversations
Rush later wrote that at the

00:18:46.317 --> 00:18:50.032
time he observed that,
quote, "Paine had realized

00:18:50.032 --> 00:18:53.164
the independance of the American
colonies upon Great

00:18:53.164 --> 00:18:55.559
Britain"
even at that time and that

00:18:55.559 --> 00:18:59.429
"he considered the measure
as necessary to bring the war to

00:18:59.429 --> 00:19:02.068
a speedy and successful
issue."

00:19:02.068 --> 00:19:03.583
So he meets Paine and one of
the things he notices is well,

00:19:03.583 --> 00:19:05.068
this guy's already kind of
thinking about independence.

00:19:05.068 --> 00:19:09.641
Paine himself later wrote about
his opinion of the colonies upon

00:19:09.641 --> 00:19:12.432
his arrival,
and he said that the thing that

00:19:12.432 --> 00:19:15.509
most struck him was how loyal
the colonists were to Great

00:19:15.509 --> 00:19:18.808
Britain,
and this is, Paine's words here.

00:19:18.808 --> 00:19:21.372
"I found the disposition
of the people such,

00:19:21.372 --> 00:19:24.469
that they might have been led
by a thread and governed by a

00:19:24.469 --> 00:19:24.950
reed.
 

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.160
Their suspicion was quick and
penetrating,

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.598
but their attachment to Britain
was obstinate,

00:19:29.598 --> 00:19:33.078
and it was at that time a kind
of treason to speak against it.

00:19:33.078 --> 00:19:37.299
They disliked the ministry,
but they esteemed the

00:19:37.299 --> 00:19:38.618
nation."
 

00:19:38.618 --> 00:19:39.958
I think that's a really
important point:

00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.776
"They disliked the
ministry but they esteemed the

00:19:41.776 --> 00:19:42.358
nation."
 

00:19:42.358 --> 00:19:45.882
"Their idea of grievance
operated without resentment,

00:19:45.882 --> 00:19:48.910
and their single object was
reconciliation ....

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.368
I viewed the dispute as a kind
of law-suit.

00:19:51.368 --> 00:19:54.782
I supposed the parties would
find a way either to decide or

00:19:54.782 --> 00:19:55.490
settle it.
 

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:58.670
I had no thoughts of
independence or of arms.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.810
The world could not then have
persuaded me that I should be

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.868
either a soldier or an
author."

00:20:03.868 --> 00:20:06.770
Ultimately, it was the battle
of Lexington that changed

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:08.167
Paine's view,
and his life,

00:20:08.167 --> 00:20:10.210
as it changed that of many
others.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.170
As Paine put it,
"when the country,

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.412
into which I had just set my
foot, was set on fire about my

00:20:15.412 --> 00:20:17.769
ears,
it was time to stir."

00:20:17.769 --> 00:20:21.625
And so it's at this point that
Paine begins to tinker with the

00:20:21.625 --> 00:20:23.460
idea of writing a pamphlet.
 

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.750
And apparently he spoke with
Benjamin Rush about it,

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:29.963
and Rush later recalled in a
letter to a friend that he

00:20:29.963 --> 00:20:33.595
offered Paine one overall piece
of advice at the outset of the

00:20:33.595 --> 00:20:34.308
project.
 

00:20:34.308 --> 00:20:36.919
He said to Paine,
"there were two words

00:20:36.919 --> 00:20:40.499
which he should avoid by every
means as necessary to his own

00:20:40.499 --> 00:20:42.622
safety and that of the
public,"

00:20:42.622 --> 00:20:45.413
and the two words were
"independence"

00:20:45.413 --> 00:20:47.720
and "republicanism."
 

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.890
Okay, and if you think about
Common Sense,

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.108
he didn't listen to that
advice at all.

00:20:52.108 --> 00:20:54.892
And as a matter of fact it's
impossible to know what went

00:20:54.892 --> 00:20:56.779
through Paine's mind at that
moment.

00:20:56.779 --> 00:20:58.880
He certainly--He knew the
colonies were,

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.137
as he put it,
on fire, he knew that popular

00:21:01.137 --> 00:21:03.720
sentiment was building even
against the King,

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.769
but knowing his personality
it's entirely possible that if

00:21:06.769 --> 00:21:08.675
Rush said to him,
'Whatever you do,

00:21:08.675 --> 00:21:11.630
don't mention independence,'
that Paine's reaction might have

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:13.318
been well,
that's at the center of it,

00:21:13.318 --> 00:21:13.690
isn't it?
 

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.265
So that's it;
that's going to be what I write

00:21:16.265 --> 00:21:17.805
about, isn't it,
and it's going to be

00:21:17.805 --> 00:21:18.490
independence.
 

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:21.272
And he might have deliberately
done the precise thing he was

00:21:21.272 --> 00:21:23.391
asked not to do,
and focus on the most

00:21:23.391 --> 00:21:26.941
controversial issue that seemed
to be at the very heart of the

00:21:26.941 --> 00:21:30.117
controversy that seemed to be,
certainly to Paine,

00:21:30.117 --> 00:21:33.526
lurking right underneath the
surface of this prevailing

00:21:33.526 --> 00:21:35.230
constitutional argument.
 

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:39.586
So Paine wrote the pamphlet,
he read parts of it to Rush as

00:21:39.586 --> 00:21:43.643
he did, and Common Sense
is published in January

00:21:43.643 --> 00:21:44.318
1776.
 

00:21:44.318 --> 00:21:46.818
And I did state correctly
earlier that he wanted to call

00:21:46.818 --> 00:21:49.364
it Plain Truth and
Benjamin Rush thought Common

00:21:49.364 --> 00:21:52.259
Sense was a better title,
and I agree with Benjamin Rush.

00:21:52.259 --> 00:21:53.980
I like Common Sense
better.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:59.001
The pamphlet--The main argument
of the pamphlet did three

00:21:59.001 --> 00:21:59.808
things.
 

00:21:59.808 --> 00:22:03.224
So number one,
it basically refuted the

00:22:03.224 --> 00:22:06.818
prevailing ideas against
independence.

00:22:06.818 --> 00:22:11.800
It went one step further and
demonstrated the necessity of

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.210
independence and how possible it
was.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:19.038
And it demonstrated the
stupidity and utter uselessness

00:22:19.038 --> 00:22:22.866
not only of the English monarchy
but just of monarchies

00:22:22.866 --> 00:22:23.858
generally.
 

00:22:23.858 --> 00:22:27.747
This is a radical message,
and it was written in a

00:22:27.747 --> 00:22:32.347
radically simple style aimed at
being accessible to a broad

00:22:32.347 --> 00:22:33.380
audience.
 

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:36.696
This was all the more radical
given that American independence

00:22:36.696 --> 00:22:39.959
had not really been seriously
discussed by the great majority

00:22:39.959 --> 00:22:43.166
of colonists with the exception
of some extreme radicals who

00:22:43.166 --> 00:22:46.048
I've been mentioning now and
again in lectures.

00:22:46.048 --> 00:22:50.507
So let's look for just a minute
at how Paine went through the

00:22:50.507 --> 00:22:53.434
three parts of his argument--
and in a sense,

00:22:53.434 --> 00:22:55.019
there's three parts of his
argument,

00:22:55.019 --> 00:22:58.390
and the pamphlet itself has
three sections.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.762
And the first section of the
pamphlet centers on getting

00:23:01.762 --> 00:23:05.012
people past this ongoing
constitutional argument about

00:23:05.012 --> 00:23:08.570
the proper relationship between
the colonies and the mother

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:09.430
country.
 

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.928
And to accomplish this,
Paine did something amazingly

00:23:12.928 --> 00:23:13.400
bold.
 

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.878
He just tossed aside the entire
idea of focusing on the English

00:23:17.878 --> 00:23:22.720
constitution as the context for
determining the fate of America,

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.545
and rather than going on and on
and on with the same

00:23:25.545 --> 00:23:28.906
constitutional debate,
he began his pamphlet with an

00:23:28.906 --> 00:23:32.657
attack not only against King
George but also against the

00:23:32.657 --> 00:23:34.500
entire idea of monarchy.
 

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.509
And he had a couple strategic
reasons for choosing to do this.

00:23:38.509 --> 00:23:42.673
First, the Crown was the last
remaining emotional and

00:23:42.673 --> 00:23:47.638
political link that was really
tying the colonies to the mother

00:23:47.638 --> 00:23:48.598
country.
 

00:23:48.598 --> 00:23:51.803
By this point,
the colonists had lost faith in

00:23:51.803 --> 00:23:54.759
Parliament,
so Paine certainly knew that if

00:23:54.759 --> 00:23:58.680
he could strike at this last
linchpin of colonial sentiment,

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.298
he could advance the cause of
independence.

00:24:02.298 --> 00:24:07.407
Second, if Paine could destroy
the legitimacy not only of King

00:24:07.407 --> 00:24:11.680
George but also of the idea of
monarchy overall,

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.700
then the English constitution's
legitimacy would suffer as well,

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:19.528
once again hopefully opening
the way for independence.

00:24:19.528 --> 00:24:22.288
And then third,
I think equally important,

00:24:22.288 --> 00:24:26.578
rhetorically Paine had a really
good writer's sense of pacing,

00:24:26.578 --> 00:24:29.944
and he knew that if he opened
this pamphlet with this really

00:24:29.944 --> 00:24:33.366
dramatic challenge to all of the
prevailing assumptions about

00:24:33.366 --> 00:24:35.942
government,
and if he turned all of these

00:24:35.942 --> 00:24:39.484
assumptions on their head,
he would pull readers in to his

00:24:39.484 --> 00:24:43.355
pamphlet and in to his argument
immediately and hold them there

00:24:43.355 --> 00:24:46.994
for the center of his argument,
which was the second section of

00:24:46.994 --> 00:24:48.807
the pamphlet,
and that is really the part

00:24:48.807 --> 00:24:50.038
that focuses on independence.
 

00:24:50.038 --> 00:24:54.388
Independence at this point was
a topic that people didn't

00:24:54.388 --> 00:24:55.710
discuss openly.
 

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:57.490
They didn't talk about it in
public.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.361
If discussed at all,
it was discussed privately

00:25:00.361 --> 00:25:03.920
among friends because basically
it amounted to treason.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.974
Paine's dramatic introduction
opened the way for him to

00:25:07.974 --> 00:25:11.278
introduce this really
controversial topic.

00:25:11.278 --> 00:25:15.044
If the English constitution
lacked legitimacy,

00:25:15.044 --> 00:25:16.548
well, what next?
 

00:25:16.548 --> 00:25:19.390
And his answer obviously is:
well, independence,

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:20.778
the obvious solution.
 

00:25:20.778 --> 00:25:23.885
Which then brings us to the
third section of the

00:25:23.885 --> 00:25:26.200
pamphlet--and that is the
future.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:31.068
Paine concludes the pamphlet by
discussing just what Americans

00:25:31.068 --> 00:25:35.460
could institute to replace the
English constitution,

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.097
what kind of government they
might be able to construct to

00:25:38.097 --> 00:25:39.950
replace what they were stripping
away.

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:46.125
Now throughout his work Paine
hammered away at old ideas and

00:25:46.125 --> 00:25:48.430
propounded new ones.
 

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:51.289
He argued that America was
distinct from England,

00:25:51.289 --> 00:25:54.567
that it was multicultural,
that it actually was more the

00:25:54.567 --> 00:25:57.309
child of Europe than the child
of England.

00:25:57.309 --> 00:25:59.539
He promoted American commerce.
 

00:25:59.539 --> 00:26:01.690
He promoted social mobility.
 

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:05.303
He praised the innocence of the
New World as compared with the

00:26:05.303 --> 00:26:07.910
corruption and decadence of the
Old World.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:12.372
He struck at the trappings of
monarchy, things like hereditary

00:26:12.372 --> 00:26:14.640
privilege and court intrigue.
 

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.603
He was an individualist arguing
that society was made of

00:26:18.603 --> 00:26:22.711
individuals who should all be
able to strive for their own

00:26:22.711 --> 00:26:23.358
good.
 

00:26:23.358 --> 00:26:27.604
He wasn't arguing that families
or patron-client relationships

00:26:27.604 --> 00:26:30.038
should define society any
longer.

00:26:30.038 --> 00:26:33.926
He depicted government as a
kind of necessary evil that was

00:26:33.926 --> 00:26:37.009
prone to create bureaucracies
and privilege.

00:26:37.009 --> 00:26:38.702
As he put it,
"Government,

00:26:38.702 --> 00:26:41.410
like dress, is the badge of
lost innocence,"

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:44.400
so it's the price we pay for
being flawed beings.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.089
And he seemed to speak of an
American millennium,

00:26:48.089 --> 00:26:51.548
speaking of America as God's
chosen people.

00:26:51.548 --> 00:26:55.318
Paine argued that America's
success was linked to the

00:26:55.318 --> 00:26:59.326
success of all humankind,
that the American colonists

00:26:59.326 --> 00:27:02.838
could launch a worldwide
democratic revolution.

00:27:02.838 --> 00:27:05.068
And, as he put it--I'll quote
it again,

00:27:05.068 --> 00:27:07.815
but I think maybe it was the
first lecture that I quoted this

00:27:07.815 --> 00:27:10.011
as my sort of random
inspirational sentences from

00:27:10.011 --> 00:27:11.980
random guy from the eighteenth
century.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:14.288
This is where this comes from.
 

00:27:14.288 --> 00:27:17.246
It's the statement about
beginning the world anew:

00:27:17.246 --> 00:27:20.926
"We have every opportunity
and every encouragement before

00:27:20.926 --> 00:27:23.060
us,
to form the noblest purest

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.538
constitution on the face of the
earth.

00:27:25.538 --> 00:27:28.384
We have it in our power to
begin the world over

00:27:28.384 --> 00:27:31.849
again....The birthday of a new
world is at hand."

00:27:31.849 --> 00:27:33.788
That's millennial talk there.
 

00:27:33.788 --> 00:27:38.152
The power of the pamphlet
wasn't just in its argument or

00:27:38.152 --> 00:27:42.597
in specific points of argument,
but rather, it was in the way

00:27:42.597 --> 00:27:45.068
that it reversed prevailing
assumptions.

00:27:45.068 --> 00:27:49.027
Paine forced readers to
consider a whole new way of

00:27:49.027 --> 00:27:53.063
looking at the impending
crisis--and actually at the

00:27:53.063 --> 00:27:55.200
entire imperial system.
 

00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:00.098
He laid bare assumptions that
had led colonists to resist

00:28:00.098 --> 00:28:03.144
independence,
and then by exposing these

00:28:03.144 --> 00:28:05.548
biases and holding them up to
scorn,

00:28:05.548 --> 00:28:09.892
he forced people to think
beyond what they had thought

00:28:09.892 --> 00:28:10.630
before.
 

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:15.073
So basically the old paradigm
had been: liberty can survive

00:28:15.073 --> 00:28:19.746
among brutal and self-interested
men only through a balance of

00:28:19.746 --> 00:28:24.419
institutionalized forces so no
one can monopolize the power of

00:28:24.419 --> 00:28:27.788
the state and rule without
opposition.

00:28:27.788 --> 00:28:29.795
So monarchy,
nobility, and the people have

00:28:29.795 --> 00:28:32.338
an equal right to share in the
struggle for power;

00:28:32.338 --> 00:28:35.058
complexity in government in
this sense is a good thing;

00:28:35.058 --> 00:28:37.318
simplicity allows for
monopolization.

00:28:37.318 --> 00:28:41.096
Well, Paine argues,
complexity is not a virtue in

00:28:41.096 --> 00:28:42.118
government.
 

00:28:42.118 --> 00:28:45.670
It simply makes it impossible
to tell who is at fault.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:49.130
Paine charged that the
complexity of the British

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:53.990
government was designed to serve
the monarchy and the nobility,

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:57.560
that the King did nothing but
wage war and hand out gifts to

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.597
his followers,
and that this entire idea of

00:29:00.597 --> 00:29:03.108
British
constitutional-institutional

00:29:03.108 --> 00:29:04.759
balance was a fraud.
 

00:29:04.759 --> 00:29:08.155
Now the boldness of this
message becomes clearer when you

00:29:08.155 --> 00:29:11.308
compare it with some other
pamphlets of the time,

00:29:11.308 --> 00:29:15.420
many of which were aimed at
exploring difficult questions--

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.367
right?--constitutional issues,
and then coming up with

00:29:18.367 --> 00:29:19.368
recommendations.
 

00:29:19.368 --> 00:29:22.084
Common Sense isn't about
exploring difficult

00:29:22.084 --> 00:29:23.548
constitutional questions.
 

00:29:23.548 --> 00:29:26.153
It aimed to,
quote, "tear the world

00:29:26.153 --> 00:29:27.088
apart."
 

00:29:27.088 --> 00:29:31.365
This pamphlet did not have the
kind of rational tone and

00:29:31.365 --> 00:29:33.517
lawyerly,
precise logic and high

00:29:33.517 --> 00:29:36.449
scholarship that you see
floating through a lot of the

00:29:36.449 --> 00:29:38.328
other pamphlets of this period.
 

00:29:38.328 --> 00:29:42.397
And the tone was part of why
the pamphlet ended up being so

00:29:42.397 --> 00:29:43.240
effective.
 

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.538
Paine didn't use legal
arguments.

00:29:45.538 --> 00:29:48.130
He didn't invoke legal
authorities.

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:51.972
He assumed that his readers
would have some kind of limited

00:29:51.972 --> 00:29:53.630
knowledge of the Bible.
 

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:55.880
He didn't use a lot of Latin,
and if he did use Latin he

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.048
tended to follow it up with an
English translation.

00:29:58.048 --> 00:30:01.791
He used really straightforward
syntax, a really simple

00:30:01.791 --> 00:30:02.710
vocabulary.
 

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:06.240
As he himself explained it:
"As it is my design to

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.380
make those that can scarcely
read understand,

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:12.960
I shall therefore avoid every
literary ornament,

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.690
and put it in language as plain
as the alphabet."

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:18.733
So what he wanted to write he
said was, quote,

00:30:18.733 --> 00:30:21.103
"simple facts,
plain arguments,

00:30:21.103 --> 00:30:22.930
and common sense."
 

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:26.944
Sometimes it was Paine's
irreverence in comparison with

00:30:26.944 --> 00:30:31.778
other pamphlet writers that made
his writing seem so effective.

00:30:31.778 --> 00:30:33.915
So for example,
writing about the origins of

00:30:33.915 --> 00:30:36.400
the English monarchy and William
the Conqueror,

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.034
Paine wrote,
"no man in his senses can

00:30:39.034 --> 00:30:42.609
say that their claim under
William the Conqueror is a very

00:30:42.609 --> 00:30:43.740
honorable one.
 

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:46.730
A French bastard landing with
an armed banditti,

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:49.342
and establishing himself king
of England against the consent

00:30:49.342 --> 00:30:52.480
of the natives,
is in plain terms a very paltry

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.368
rascally original."
 

00:30:54.368 --> 00:30:54.611
Okay.
 

00:30:54.611 --> 00:30:56.160
It's not your typical pamphlet.
 

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.964
Sometimes he used really
straightforward language just

00:30:59.964 --> 00:31:03.101
for shock value,
trying to make his point

00:31:03.101 --> 00:31:05.980
by--trying to upset prevailing
ideas--

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:09.021
by saying something in a
shockingly straightforward and

00:31:09.021 --> 00:31:10.150
irreverent manner.
 

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.777
And that's obviously going to
be really effective if he was

00:31:12.777 --> 00:31:15.451
talking about the King--to use
sort of shockingly irreverent

00:31:15.451 --> 00:31:16.038
language.
 

00:31:16.038 --> 00:31:18.386
So for example,
he really tried hard to

00:31:18.386 --> 00:31:21.468
dehumanize King George III,
writing for example,

00:31:21.468 --> 00:31:24.910
he has "sunk himself
beneath the rank of animals,

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:28.640
and contemptibly crawls through
the world like a worm."

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:28.911
Okay.
 

00:31:28.911 --> 00:31:30.647
[laughs]
That's pretty irreverent

00:31:30.647 --> 00:31:31.298
language.
 

00:31:31.298 --> 00:31:34.118
"Even brutes do not devour
their young."

00:31:34.118 --> 00:31:34.375
Okay.
 

00:31:34.375 --> 00:31:36.637
That would have been really
shocking [laughs]

00:31:36.637 --> 00:31:39.670
to someone to read at the time,
that that's a description of

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:40.390
the King.
 

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:43.828
Or he used sarcasm,
as in this sentence.

00:31:43.828 --> 00:31:46.035
Now I mentioned this
sentence--I don't know--in the

00:31:46.035 --> 00:31:47.578
first--one of the early
lectures.

00:31:47.578 --> 00:31:50.958
I talked about a sentence that
I really liked and I accused

00:31:50.958 --> 00:31:53.930
Benjamin Rush of cutting it out
of the pamphlet,

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:56.171
and I'm here to redeem Benjamin
Rush because when I looked this

00:31:56.171 --> 00:31:58.338
up today to double check on
myself what I discovered was,

00:31:58.338 --> 00:32:01.410
this is actually Benjamin
Rush's favorite sentence and

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:03.380
Benjamin Franklin struck it out.
 

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.568
[laughs]
So it was in the draft but it

00:32:05.568 --> 00:32:08.705
didn't make the final printed
copy of Common Sense,

00:32:08.705 --> 00:32:10.660
and this is the sentence.
 

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:10.939
Okay.
 

00:32:10.939 --> 00:32:13.788
"A greater absurdity
cannot be conceived of,

00:32:13.788 --> 00:32:16.663
than three millions of people
running to their seacoast every

00:32:16.663 --> 00:32:19.640
time a ship arrives from London,
to know what portion of liberty

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.690
they should enjoy."
 

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:22.309
I think that's a good sentence.
 

00:32:22.309 --> 00:32:23.069
I agree with Rush.
 

00:32:23.069 --> 00:32:24.180
I think Franklin had it wrong.
 

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.768
I think that's good sort of
pointed sarcasm,

00:32:26.768 --> 00:32:30.140
so I'm sorry it didn't make the
final printed version.

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.318
Rush is right.
 

00:32:31.318 --> 00:32:33.862
So sarcasm--effecti
ve--irreverence,

00:32:33.862 --> 00:32:35.970
shock value--all effective.
 

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.588
Even just emotion,
even Paine's emotion,

00:32:38.588 --> 00:32:41.190
was effective because it was so
strong,

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.624
because he was so passionate,
and because he was so

00:32:43.624 --> 00:32:46.608
straightforward,
as in a sentence like this.

00:32:46.608 --> 00:32:51.082
"Every thing that is right
or reasonable pleads for

00:32:51.082 --> 00:32:52.140
separation.
 

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:55.776
The blood of the slain,
the weeping voice of nature

00:32:55.776 --> 00:32:59.193
cries, 'TIS TIME TO PART.'"
Okay, dramatic,

00:32:59.193 --> 00:33:01.740
passionate, emotional language.
 

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.890
So all of this stuff that I'm
describing here,

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:06.230
all of this rhetoric,
all of this logic,

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:09.220
all of the sort of rationale
behind this pamphlet--

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:13.019
this is popular culture but
it's not low culture.

00:33:13.019 --> 00:33:16.714
It may not have had really
refined language but it had

00:33:16.714 --> 00:33:18.038
correct language.
 

00:33:18.038 --> 00:33:22.416
As Thomas Jefferson put it,
"No writer has exceeded

00:33:22.416 --> 00:33:25.759
Paine in ease and familiarity of
style,

00:33:25.759 --> 00:33:29.858
in perspicuity of expression,
happiness of elucidation,

00:33:29.858 --> 00:33:32.078
and in simple and unassuming
language."

00:33:32.078 --> 00:33:32.400
Okay.
 

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.093
By writing that,
Jefferson achieved none of

00:33:35.093 --> 00:33:36.118
those things.
 

00:33:36.118 --> 00:33:37.576
[laughs]
That's like a really good

00:33:37.576 --> 00:33:40.224
example of how different Paine
sounded, [laughs]--perspicuity

00:33:40.224 --> 00:33:42.299
of expression and happiness of
elucidation.

00:33:42.299 --> 00:33:44.328
Okay, not in Common Sense.
 

00:33:44.328 --> 00:33:47.078
Jefferson does not sound
like Thomas Paine.

00:33:47.078 --> 00:33:50.095
Given all of this,
the widespread popularity of

00:33:50.095 --> 00:33:54.094
the pamphlet isn't surprising,
and the first printing sold out

00:33:54.094 --> 00:33:55.338
in a few weeks.
 

00:33:55.338 --> 00:33:58.337
There were many re-printings,
first in Pennsylvania,

00:33:58.337 --> 00:34:01.630
then in other colonies,
and even ultimately in Europe.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:04.890
And all in all,
a majority of the population of

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:08.786
the colonies either read
Common Sense or received

00:34:08.786 --> 00:34:13.039
some kind of distilled version
of it at their local tavern or

00:34:13.039 --> 00:34:16.541
in conversation,
as presented by other people

00:34:16.541 --> 00:34:17.679
who had read it.
 

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:21.409
By March of 1776,
there had been 125,000 copies

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:26.356
sold and by colonial standards
that's a mind-blowing number of

00:34:26.356 --> 00:34:29.137
copies,
and here's a way to sort of put

00:34:29.137 --> 00:34:30.130
that in context.
 

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:33.139
At this period,
even later, even in the 1790s,

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:36.079
in a city like New York or
Pennsylvania,

00:34:36.079 --> 00:34:40.050
a newspaper that would have
been considered to have a big

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:42.938
circulation number--
like wow, that's a really big

00:34:42.938 --> 00:34:46.152
newspaper--
would have had a circulation of

00:34:46.152 --> 00:34:46.668
1,000.
 

00:34:46.668 --> 00:34:47.268
Okay.
 

00:34:47.268 --> 00:34:50.719
So 125,000 copies is a lot of
copies.

00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:53.130
That's a pretty remarkable
number.

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:56.487
And sales were helped by the
fact that the pamphlet was

00:34:56.487 --> 00:34:59.846
priced really low so that it
could be bought by anyone,

00:34:59.846 --> 00:35:01.650
even the relatively poor.
 

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:04.731
Now of course Paine wasn't shy
about his own accomplishments

00:35:04.731 --> 00:35:07.811
and he later told anybody who
would listen that his pamphlet

00:35:07.811 --> 00:35:10.572
had enjoyed,
quote, "the greatest sale

00:35:10.572 --> 00:35:13.757
that any performance [has]
ever had since the use of

00:35:13.757 --> 00:35:14.820
letters."
 

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:15.682
[laughter]
Okay.

00:35:15.682 --> 00:35:17.179
That's not a modest man.
 

00:35:17.179 --> 00:35:20.789
It is the greatest-selling
thing of all time.

00:35:20.789 --> 00:35:21.150
Okay.
 

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:23.969
Okay, Tom, it's important but
come on.

00:35:23.969 --> 00:35:26.456
[laughter]
Now of course not everybody

00:35:26.456 --> 00:35:29.820
cheered with the publication of
Common Sense.

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:33.297
There were many people who
were enraged at what it dared to

00:35:33.297 --> 00:35:36.719
say about the English monarch,
about the British constitution,

00:35:36.719 --> 00:35:38.010
about independence.
 

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.940
Who was this guy anyway? Right?
 

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:43.570
Who was he to promote
independence?

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:47.621
As Samuel Adams put it with
actually unusual understatement

00:35:47.621 --> 00:35:50.043
for Samuel Adams--
he said the pamphlet,

00:35:50.043 --> 00:35:52.530
quote, "has fretted some
folks here more than a

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:53.309
little."
 

00:35:53.309 --> 00:35:55.500
It upset a lot of people.
 

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.954
More direct criticism was
issued by an English gentleman

00:35:58.954 --> 00:36:01.280
traveling in Virginia in his
diary.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.744
He wrote, "A pamphlet
called Common Sense makes

00:36:04.744 --> 00:36:05.699
a great noise.
 

00:36:05.699 --> 00:36:08.599
One of the vilest things that
ever was published to the world.

00:36:08.599 --> 00:36:13.192
Full of false representations,
lies, calumny,

00:36:13.192 --> 00:36:15.280
and treason."
 

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.840
Now you may be surprised to
hear that John Adams,

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:22.251
ultimately a leading proponent
of independence,

00:36:22.251 --> 00:36:24.699
did not like Common Sense.
 

00:36:24.699 --> 00:36:26.829
John Adams did not like the
pamphlet.

00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:29.170
It wasn't because of the first
two parts.

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:29.639
Right?
 

00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:32.039
He's all for questioning the
British constitution.

00:36:32.039 --> 00:36:33.880
He's all for independence.
 

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.885
That's fine,
but what really got Adams was

00:36:36.885 --> 00:36:39.599
the third section of the
pamphlet,

00:36:39.599 --> 00:36:42.679
the section about what kind of
government might we be able to

00:36:42.679 --> 00:36:45.349
create in the absence of the
British constitution.

00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:48.626
This made Adams crazy,
because to Adams and to many

00:36:48.626 --> 00:36:51.931
others at the time,
good lawmakers were supposed to

00:36:51.931 --> 00:36:55.295
always be practical thinkers and
they were supposed to be

00:36:55.295 --> 00:36:58.179
realistic about what a society
could achieve.

00:36:58.179 --> 00:37:01.168
They were supposed to think
about the realities of a society

00:37:01.168 --> 00:37:03.550
and then what would be
politically possible,

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:05.369
and this is not what he thought
Paine was doing.

00:37:05.369 --> 00:37:08.483
He thought Paine was sort of
blue sky, unrealistic,

00:37:08.483 --> 00:37:10.478
tossings off about
possibilities,

00:37:10.478 --> 00:37:13.780
without thinking really hard
about probabilities.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:17.940
So this is John Adams' summary
of Common Sense.

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:19.405
This is true John Adams.
 

00:37:19.405 --> 00:37:19.719
Okay.
 

00:37:19.719 --> 00:37:22.364
Common Sense,
quote, "a poor,

00:37:22.364 --> 00:37:24.545
ignorant, malicious,
shortsighted,

00:37:24.545 --> 00:37:26.199
crapulous mass."
 

00:37:26.199 --> 00:37:29.387
[laughs]
That's John Adams' opinion of

00:37:29.387 --> 00:37:30.940
Common Sense.
 

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.054
I have to add here for no
reason except that when I was

00:37:34.054 --> 00:37:37.349
writing this I thought of it,
and then this is my excuse to

00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:39.789
mention it in a lecture,
and so I will.

00:37:39.789 --> 00:37:42.940
How many of you here have read
Plato's Republic?

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.480
 Some of you have read
Plato's Republic.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.670
Okay.
 

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:49.692
John Adams really did not like
Plato's Republic either,

00:37:49.692 --> 00:37:51.030
and for the same reasons.
 

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.224
Right?
 

00:37:51.224 --> 00:37:52.400
He thought Plato was
irresponsible.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.909
He hated Plato's Republic.
 

00:37:53.909 --> 00:37:55.949
Jefferson was not a big fan
either.

00:37:55.949 --> 00:37:59.090
He thought that--Actually,
both of them thought that Plato

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:02.233
was sort of vaporing about
political ideals and not really

00:38:02.233 --> 00:38:05.320
thinking about realistic
application to real people.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.797
So to these guys at this time
the real challenge of what

00:38:08.797 --> 00:38:11.960
they're doing is to match ideals
and realities,

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.280
and they didn't think Plato was
doing that at all.

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.791
So this is what Adams first had
to say about Plato's

00:38:16.791 --> 00:38:18.858
Republic:
 "While wading

00:38:18.858 --> 00:38:21.309
through the whimsies,
the puerilities,

00:38:21.309 --> 00:38:24.309
and unintelligible jargon of
this work,

00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:27.548
I laid it down often to ask
myself how it could have been

00:38:27.548 --> 00:38:30.498
that the world should have so
long consented to give

00:38:30.498 --> 00:38:33.159
reputation to such nonsense as
this."

00:38:33.159 --> 00:38:33.750
[laughter] Okay.
 

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.474
He really doesn't like Plato's
Republic, but he also

00:38:36.474 --> 00:38:37.650
just didn't like Plato.
 

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:41.795
So overall he said--he talked
about how he read all of Plato's

00:38:41.795 --> 00:38:45.237
works and he talked about oh,
he had three Latin dictionaries

00:38:45.237 --> 00:38:47.239
and a German one and a French
one just in case,

00:38:47.239 --> 00:38:50.648
and he worked his way through,
and he said he learned only two

00:38:50.648 --> 00:38:52.550
things from all of Plato's work.
 

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:55.217
He learned, number one,
that Benjamin Franklin stole an

00:38:55.217 --> 00:38:58.286
idea from Plato [laughter]--
didn't give him credit,

00:38:58.286 --> 00:39:00.079
[laughs]
and number two,

00:39:00.079 --> 00:39:02.820
he learned that sneezing is a
cure for the hiccups.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:03.994
[laughter]
And he said,

00:39:03.994 --> 00:39:06.730
quote, "Accordingly,
I have cured myself and all my

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:08.260
friends of that provoking
disorder,

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:09.969
for thirty years,
with a pinch of snuff."

00:39:09.969 --> 00:39:10.342
Okay.
 

00:39:10.342 --> 00:39:12.429
That's Plato to John Adams.
 

00:39:12.429 --> 00:39:13.840
[laughs] That's it.
 

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.159
So I just love that.
 

00:39:15.159 --> 00:39:15.679
I love that.
 

00:39:15.679 --> 00:39:16.940
It's John Adams at his best.
 

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:17.268
Okay.
 

00:39:17.268 --> 00:39:20.230
So away from Plato,
back to Common Sense.

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:23.905
 For many people Common
Sense was kind of a

00:39:23.905 --> 00:39:27.422
conversion experience,
and there are people that are

00:39:27.422 --> 00:39:30.300
fence sitters who maybe--
might have had the makings of a

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.452
radical and in reading the
pamphlet or hearing of the

00:39:32.452 --> 00:39:34.797
pamphlet,
they actually were radicalized

00:39:34.797 --> 00:39:35.219
by it.
 

00:39:35.219 --> 00:39:36.920
It was talked of everywhere.
 

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.385
As Rush put it,
"Its effects were sudden

00:39:39.385 --> 00:39:41.570
and extensive upon the American
mind.

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:42.969
It was read by public men."
 

00:39:42.969 --> 00:39:46.059
It was "repeated in Clubs,
spouted in schools,

00:39:46.059 --> 00:39:49.177
and in one instance delivered
from the pulpit instead of a

00:39:49.177 --> 00:39:50.889
sermon,
by a clergyman in

00:39:50.889 --> 00:39:52.130
Connecticut."
 

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:53.570
That's a Connecticut moment.
 

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:56.505
I'm always happy when we have
little Connecticut or Yale

00:39:56.505 --> 00:39:57.039
moments.
 

00:39:57.039 --> 00:39:58.750
It was talked about everywhere.
 

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:01.842
Its rhetoric was so powerful
that for many it inspired them

00:40:01.842 --> 00:40:04.324
to stand back,
examine their situation,

00:40:04.324 --> 00:40:07.409
and really loathe Britain for
the first time--

00:40:07.409 --> 00:40:09.239
like oh, [laughs]
I've never thought of loathing

00:40:09.239 --> 00:40:11.630
Britain before,
but yet now I am.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:14.016
As George Washington wrote,
Common Sense was

00:40:14.016 --> 00:40:17.170
"working a wonderful change
in the minds of many men."

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:20.356
In the end, regardless of
whether one agreed or not with

00:40:20.356 --> 00:40:22.500
his argument,
Paine's pamphlet did one

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.469
fundamentally important thing.
 

00:40:24.469 --> 00:40:27.753
He focused the prevailing
colonial political conversation

00:40:27.753 --> 00:40:28.809
on independence.
 

00:40:28.809 --> 00:40:33.639
He lifted the argument above
constitutional reckoning.

00:40:33.639 --> 00:40:37.114
He inspired others to write
about the topic as well,

00:40:37.114 --> 00:40:40.179
sometimes for independence,
sometimes against,

00:40:40.179 --> 00:40:43.789
but independence became now the
topic to discuss.

00:40:43.789 --> 00:40:47.135
As a reader in Boston put it,
"Independence a year ago

00:40:47.135 --> 00:40:50.309
could not have been publicly
mentioned with impunity.

00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:53.646
Nothing else is now talked of,
and I know not what can be done

00:40:53.646 --> 00:40:55.780
by Great Britain to prevent
it."

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:59.284
Now Paine was all too happy to
remind anyone who would listen

00:40:59.284 --> 00:41:01.679
about the significance of his
pamphlet.

00:41:01.679 --> 00:41:03.929
He considered it his lifetime
achievement.

00:41:03.929 --> 00:41:07.030
He wanted his tombstone to read
"Thomas Paine,

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:08.320
author of Common
Sense."

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.096
Of course,
that was assuming he was going

00:41:10.096 --> 00:41:11.608
to have a tombstone which
[laughter]

00:41:11.608 --> 00:41:12.170
he didn't.
 

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:13.719
[laughs] The poor guy.
 

00:41:13.719 --> 00:41:16.280
I didn't think of that until
this second--oh,

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:16.980
bad irony.
 

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:20.351
He said that regardless of
whatever form he took in the

00:41:20.351 --> 00:41:24.409
afterlife, he would always know
he had written Common Sense.

00:41:24.409 --> 00:41:28.119
Okay, but did Common Sense
cause independence?

00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:28.351
Okay.
 

00:41:28.351 --> 00:41:30.940
Paine clearly would have loved
to tell you that it did.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:34.030
That's the kind of conclusion
you really can't make,

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:37.070
but clearly you can say it was
so powerful,

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:40.030
so widely read,
so controversial that it

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:43.981
shattered much of the
psychological resistance to the

00:41:43.981 --> 00:41:45.880
idea of independence.
 

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:49.628
And also on a more social
level, Common Sense

00:41:49.628 --> 00:41:54.016
invited an entire range of
people into the political

00:41:54.016 --> 00:41:58.563
conversation that in some ways
hadn't really been included

00:41:58.563 --> 00:42:01.257
before,
just by deliberately making

00:42:01.257 --> 00:42:04.820
this pamphlet available to as
broad an audience as possible.

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:09.458
And his message in a sense was
fundamentally democratizing as

00:42:09.458 --> 00:42:10.000
well.
 

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.371
Paine preached that any people
can deliberate and decide how

00:42:14.371 --> 00:42:16.300
they are to be governed.
 

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:18.800
And then they can act on that
choice.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:22.581
Any people are capable of
creating and implementing their

00:42:22.581 --> 00:42:23.730
own government.
 

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:26.143
It's a powerful message,
and regardless of whether

00:42:26.143 --> 00:42:29.199
people agreed or disagreed about
what government they should be

00:42:29.199 --> 00:42:31.728
creating,
the ideas underlying that

00:42:31.728 --> 00:42:35.260
pamphlet in a sense were really
revolutionary,

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:37.159
in a sense, and certainly
radicalizing,

00:42:37.159 --> 00:42:40.719
just at this moment when things
are taking a turn,

00:42:40.719 --> 00:42:43.603
just at this moment when the
King has declared the colonies

00:42:43.603 --> 00:42:45.940
in rebellion,
and very soon we're going to

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:47.480
have Lexington and Concord.
 

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.192
So you can see how we're right
at this moment where things are

00:42:50.192 --> 00:42:51.260
going to take a shift.
 

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.237
Common Sense,
partly timing-wise,

00:42:53.237 --> 00:42:56.228
came out at just the moment
where it was going to strike and

00:42:56.228 --> 00:42:57.699
have the broadest impact.
 

00:42:57.699 --> 00:42:59.539
That is all I have for today.
 

00:42:59.539 --> 00:43:00.650
Have a good weekend.
 

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:05.440
I will see you on Tuesday and
we will move on to independence.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.340
We get independence next week.
 

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.500
It's very exciting.
 

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:14.000

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.768
 Professor Ben
Polak: All right,

00:00:03.768 --> 00:00:06.495
so last time we did something I
think substantially harder than

00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:08.430
anything we've done in the class
so far.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.429
We looked at mixed strategies,
and in particular,

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.700
we looked at mixed-strategy
equilibria.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.202
There was a big idea last time.
The big idea was if a player is

00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:26.392
playing a mixed strategy in
equilibrium, then every pure

00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:31.116
strategy in the mix--that's to
say every pure strategy on which

00:00:31.116 --> 00:00:35.002
they place some positive
weight--must also be a best

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:38.660
response to what the other side
is doing.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.379
Then we used that trick.
We used it in this game here,

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.264
to help us find Nash Equilibria
and the way it allowed us to

00:00:46.264 --> 00:00:49.360
find the Nash Equilibria is we
knew that if,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.149
in this case,
Venus Williams is mixing

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.070
between left and right,
it must be this case that her

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.896
payoff is equal to that of right
and we use that to find Serena's

00:01:00.896 --> 00:01:03.806
mix.
Conversely, since we knew that

00:01:03.806 --> 00:01:07.974
Serena is mixing again between l
and r, we knew she must be

00:01:07.974 --> 00:01:12.790
indifferent between l and r and
we used that to find Venus' mix.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.606
So I want to go back to this
example just for a few moments

00:01:15.606 --> 00:01:18.180
just to make one more point and
then we'll move on,

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.415
but we'll still be talking
about mixed strategies

00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:23.140
throughout today.
So this was the mix that we

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.957
found before we changed the
payoffs, we found that Venus'

00:01:26.957 --> 00:01:34.295
equilibrium mix was .7,
.3 and Serena's equilibrium mix

00:01:34.295 --> 00:01:38.198
was .6, .4.
And a reasonable question at

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:41.383
this point would be,
how do we know that's really an

00:01:41.383 --> 00:01:43.550
equilibrium?
We kind of found it but we

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.160
didn't kind of go back and
check.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.071
So what I want to do now is
actually do that,

00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:48.977
do that missing step.
We rushed it a bit last time

00:01:48.977 --> 00:01:50.629
because we wanted to get through
all the material.

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:56.394
Let's actually check that in
fact P* is a best response to

00:01:56.394 --> 00:02:00.666
Q*.
So what I want to do is I want

00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:08.574
to check that Venus' mix P* is a
best response for Venus against

00:02:08.574 --> 00:02:13.007
Serena's mix Q*.
The way I'm going to do that is

00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:16.904
I'm going to look at payoffs
that Venus gets now she knows -

00:02:16.904 --> 00:02:20.669
or rather now we know
she's playing against Q*.

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:23.009
So let's look at Venus'
payoffs..

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.297
I'm going to figure out her
payoffs for L,

00:02:26.297 --> 00:02:29.985
her payoffs for R,
and also her payoff for what

00:02:29.985 --> 00:02:34.159
she's actually doing P*.
So Venus' payoffs,

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:40.267
if she chooses L against Q*
then she gets--very similar to

00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:44.340
what we had on the board last
week,

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.361
but now I'm going to put in
what Q* is explicitly--she gets

00:02:49.361 --> 00:02:56.039
50 times .6..
[This is Q* and this is 1-Q*.].

00:02:56.039 --> 00:03:07.875
So she gets 50 times .6 and 80
times 1 minus .6 which is .4,80

00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:11.335
times .4.
We can work this out,

00:03:11.335 --> 00:03:14.428
and I worked it out at home,
but if somebody has a

00:03:14.428 --> 00:03:16.890
calculator they can please check
me.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:24.120
I think this comes to .62.
Somebody should just check that.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.961
If Venus chose R--remember R
here means shooting to Serena's

00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:36.199
right, to Serena's forehand--if
she chose R then her payoffs are

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:41.440
90 Q*.
So 90(.6) plus 20(1-Q*) so

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:51.249
20(.4), so 90(.6) plus 20(.4),
and again I worked that out at

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:59.750
home, and fortunately that also
comes out at .62.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:07.135
So what's Venus' payoff for P*?
We've got her payoff for both

00:04:07.135 --> 00:04:12.201
her pure strategies,
so her payoff from actually

00:04:12.201 --> 00:04:16.343
choosing P* is what?
Well, P* is .7,

00:04:16.343 --> 00:04:22.556
so .7 of the time she will
actually be playing L and when

00:04:22.556 --> 00:04:29.340
she plays L,
she'll get a payoff of .62,

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:39.959
and .3 of the time she'll be
playing R, and once again,

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:49.750
she'll be getting a payoff of
.62 and--do I have a calculator?

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.476
Sorry, thank you.
So P* is .7,

00:04:51.476 --> 00:04:55.619
yes, you're absolutely right,
so this is P* and 1-P*,

00:04:55.619 --> 00:05:00.225
So let's make that clearer.
I'll show you what the

00:05:00.225 --> 00:05:03.850
equilibrium is but P* itself is
.7.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.754
So when Venus plays L with
probability of .7,

00:05:06.754 --> 00:05:10.715
then .7 of the time she'll get
the expected payoff of .62 and

00:05:10.715 --> 00:05:14.479
.3 of the time she'll get a
payoff again of .62 and that's

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.780
the kind of math I don't have to
do at home,

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.082
that's going to come out at .62.
Again, assuming my math is

00:05:23.082 --> 00:05:25.148
correct.
So all I've really done here is

00:05:25.148 --> 00:05:26.970
confirm what we did already last
time.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:33.502
We knew--we in fact chose
Serena's mix Q to make Venus

00:05:33.502 --> 00:05:39.267
indifferent between L and R.
And that's exactly what we

00:05:39.267 --> 00:05:43.959
found here, going left it's .62,
going right it gets .62 and

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:47.327
hence P* gets .62.
But I claim we can now see

00:05:47.327 --> 00:05:51.134
something a little bit else.
We can now ask the question,

00:05:51.134 --> 00:05:53.389
is P* in fact the best
response?

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.068
Well, for it not to be a best
response, for this not to be an

00:05:57.068 --> 00:06:00.747
equilibrium, there would have to
be some deviation that Venus

00:06:00.747 --> 00:06:04.120
could make that would make her
strictly better off.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.486
Let me repeat that.
If this were not an

00:06:06.486 --> 00:06:10.991
equilibrium, there would have to
be some deviation for Venus,

00:06:10.991 --> 00:06:14.220
that would make her strictly
better off.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.170
By playing P* she's getting a
return of .62.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:23.300
So one thing she could deviate
to, is playing L all the time.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.821
If she deviates to playing L
all the time,

00:06:26.821 --> 00:06:31.889
her payoff is still .62 so
she's not strictly better off.

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:35.290
That's not a strictly
profitable deviation.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.300
Another thing she could deviate
to, is she could deviate to

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.712
playing R.
If she deviates to playing R,

00:06:42.712 --> 00:06:46.820
her payoff will be .62.
Once again, she's not strictly

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.711
better off: she's the same as
she was before,

00:06:49.711 --> 00:06:52.930
so that's not a strictly
profitable deviation.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.757
So what have I shown so far?
I've shown that P* is as good

00:06:56.757 --> 00:07:00.480
as playing L,
and P* is as good as playing R.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.639
In fact that's how we
constructed it.

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:07.183
So deviating to L is not a
strictly profitable deviation

00:07:07.183 --> 00:07:12.139
and deviating to R is not a
strictly profitable deviation.

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:15.578
But at this point,
somebody might ask and say,

00:07:15.578 --> 00:07:19.858
okay, you've shown me that
there's no way to deviate to a

00:07:19.858 --> 00:07:23.449
pure strategy in a strictly
profitable way,

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:28.670
but how about deviating to
another mixed strategy?

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:43.789
So, so far we've shown--we've
shown just up here--we can see

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:56.602
that Venus has no strictly
profitable pure-strategy

00:07:56.602 --> 00:08:02.412
deviation.
She has no strictly profitable

00:08:02.412 --> 00:08:06.708
pure-strategy deviation because
each of her pure strategies

00:08:06.708 --> 00:08:10.560
yields the same payoff as did
her mixed strategy,

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.483
yields the same as P*.
But how do we know that she

00:08:14.483 --> 00:08:18.920
doesn't have a mixed strategy
that would be strictly better?

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:26.130
How do we know that?
Anybody?

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:29.220
No hands going up;
oh, there was a hand up, good.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.411
Student: Any mix between
left and right will still yield

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:34.909
.62.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:39.208
Good, so any mix that Venus
deviates to, will be a mix

00:08:39.208 --> 00:08:43.707
between L and R,
and any mix between L and R

00:08:43.707 --> 00:08:50.279
will be a mix between .62 and
.62 and hence will yield .62.

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:53.278
So we're going to use again,
this fact we developed last

00:08:53.278 --> 00:08:56.097
week.
The fact we developed last week

00:08:56.097 --> 00:09:00.186
was that any mixed strategy
yields a payoff that is a

00:09:00.186 --> 00:09:04.039
weighted average of the pure
strategy payoffs,

00:09:04.039 --> 00:09:06.570
the payoffs to the pure
strategies in the mix.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.274
Any mixed strategy yields a
payoff that is a weighted

00:09:09.274 --> 00:09:12.290
average of the payoff to the
pure strategies in the mix.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:16.125
That was our key fact last week.
So here if we've shown that

00:09:16.125 --> 00:09:19.947
there's no pure-strategy
deviation that's strictly

00:09:19.947 --> 00:09:23.253
profitable,
then there can't be any mixed

00:09:23.253 --> 00:09:26.840
strategy deviation that's
strictly profitable.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.156
Why?
Because the mixed strategy

00:09:29.156 --> 00:09:33.372
deviations must yield payoffs
that lie among the pure strategy

00:09:33.372 --> 00:09:36.310
deviations.
So this is a great fact for us.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:50.879
What's the lesson here?
The lesson is we only ever have

00:09:50.879 --> 00:10:12.900
to check for strictly profitable
pure-strategy deviations.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:13.960
That's a good job.
Why?

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.316
Because if we had to check for
mixed strategy deviations one by

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:20.123
one, we'd be here all night,
because there's an infinite

00:10:20.123 --> 00:10:22.139
number of possible
mixed-strategy deviations.

00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:23.848
But there aren't so many pure
strategy deviations we have to

00:10:23.848 --> 00:10:25.820
check.
Let's just repeat the idea.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.704
Suppose there isn't any
pure-strategy deviation that's

00:10:29.704 --> 00:10:34.027
profitable, then there can't be
any mixed strategy deviation

00:10:34.027 --> 00:10:37.639
that's profitable,
because the highest expected

00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:41.139
return you could ever get from a
mixed strategy,

00:10:41.139 --> 00:10:44.347
is one of the pure strategies
in the mix, and you've already

00:10:44.347 --> 00:10:46.740
checked that none of those are
profitable.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.705
So this simple idea,
the simple idea we developed

00:10:50.705 --> 00:10:55.000
last time, not only helps us to
find Nash Equilibria,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.470
but also to check for Nash
Equilibria.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.535
Now a lot of people I gathered
from feedback from sections were

00:11:02.535 --> 00:11:06.210
left pretty confused last time.
It's a hard idea.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.262
Actually I looked at the tape
over the weekend,

00:11:09.262 --> 00:11:12.049
I could see where it could be
confusing.

00:11:12.049 --> 00:11:13.957
But it's actually,
I think what's really confusing

00:11:13.957 --> 00:11:16.370
here--it wasn't so much--I think
it wasn't so much that I could

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.549
have been clearer though I'm
sure I could have been.

00:11:18.549 --> 00:11:21.777
It's that this is really a hard
idea, this idea of mixed

00:11:21.777 --> 00:11:23.830
strategies.
So we're going to work on it

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.457
again today, but I think one of
the ideas that gets people

00:11:26.457 --> 00:11:30.712
confused, is the following idea.
They say, look we found Venus'

00:11:30.712 --> 00:11:35.558
equilibrium mix by choosing a P
and a 1-P to make Serena

00:11:35.558 --> 00:11:38.854
indifferent.
We found Serena's equilibrium

00:11:38.854 --> 00:11:42.871
mix by finding a Q and a 1-Q to
make Venus indifferent and a

00:11:42.871 --> 00:11:46.139
natural question you hear people
ask then is,

00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:50.980
why is Venus "trying to make
Serena indifferent?"

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:55.019
Why is Serena "trying to make
Venus indifferent?"

00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:57.330
That's not really the point
here.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:01.409
It isn't that Venus is trying
to make Serena indifferent.

00:12:01.409 --> 00:12:04.529
It's that in equilibrium,
she is going to make Serena

00:12:04.529 --> 00:12:06.804
indifferent.
It isn't her goal in life to

00:12:06.804 --> 00:12:09.928
make Serena indifferent between
l and r, and it isn't Serena's

00:12:09.928 --> 00:12:12.899
goal in life to make Venus
indifferent between L and R,

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:16.981
but in equilibrium it ends up
that they make each other

00:12:16.981 --> 00:12:20.239
indifferent.
The way that we can see that is

00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:24.497
that if Venus puts--we said last
time it's repeated--if Venus

00:12:24.497 --> 00:12:27.588
puts too much weight,
more than .7 on L,

00:12:27.588 --> 00:12:31.289
then Serena just cheats to the
left all the time,

00:12:31.289 --> 00:12:34.759
and that can't possibly be an
equilibrium.

00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:37.928
And if Venus puts too much
weight on R, then Serena cheats

00:12:37.928 --> 00:12:41.320
to the right all the time and
that can't be an equilibrium.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:46.498
So it has to be that what Venus
is doing is going to make Serena

00:12:46.498 --> 00:12:49.539
exactly indifferent and vice
versa.

00:12:49.539 --> 00:12:52.960
Now let's see that idea in some
other applications.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.679
Let's talk about this a bit
before we move on.

00:12:56.679 --> 00:13:01.408
So it turns out that some very
natural applications for

00:13:01.408 --> 00:13:06.050
mixed-strategy equilibria arise
in games, in sport.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:10.657
So let's talk about a few now.
Can anybody suggest some other

00:13:10.657 --> 00:13:14.869
places where we see
randomization or at least mixed

00:13:14.869 --> 00:13:18.659
strategy in equilibria in
sporting events?

00:13:18.659 --> 00:13:22.570
Let me actually grab the mike
myself.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:26.895
Anybody here play football for
example, and we're talking

00:13:26.895 --> 00:13:29.984
American football now,
the gridiron game,

00:13:29.984 --> 00:13:33.149
not the civilized type.
Anyone play?

00:13:33.149 --> 00:13:34.570
Yes, so some of you play
football.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:40.450
So where is the mixing involved
in playing football?

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:42.470
Where in equilibrium would we
expect to see mixed strategies?

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:46.660
There's somebody down there can
we go on and get them.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.340
So shout it out.
Student: Running game

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.673
and passing game.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:13:50.673 --> 00:13:51.850
right, the running game and the
passing game.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:55.624
So a very simple idea whether
to run or whether to pass when

00:13:55.624 --> 00:13:59.206
you have the ball is likely to
end up as a mixed-strategy

00:13:59.206 --> 00:14:02.178
equilibrium.
The defense is also randomizing

00:14:02.178 --> 00:14:05.447
between, for example,
rushing the passer or playing a

00:14:05.447 --> 00:14:07.570
run defense.
Is that right--this is not

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.932
exactly a game I know a lot
about, but I'm hoping I'm

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:12.686
getting close enough here.
It couldn't possibly be a

00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:15.847
pure-strategy equilibrium,
other than very extreme parts

00:14:15.847 --> 00:14:18.046
of the game,
like at the end of the game

00:14:18.046 --> 00:14:20.968
perhaps, but for most of the
game, it's very unlikely to end

00:14:20.968 --> 00:14:22.799
up as a pure-strategy
equilibrium.

00:14:22.799 --> 00:14:25.363
Much more likely that the
offense is mixing between

00:14:25.363 --> 00:14:27.772
passing and running,
and for that matter between

00:14:27.772 --> 00:14:31.151
going to the left,
going to the right and going to

00:14:31.151 --> 00:14:35.437
the center, and the defense is
also mixing between--over its

00:14:35.437 --> 00:14:38.610
types of defense.
So we see that--for those

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.981
people who were watching
yesterday--we see that in

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:46.174
football games.
Where do we see it else in

00:14:46.174 --> 00:14:50.559
sport, some other sports?
I can't have a room full of

00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:52.873
non-sports fans.
How many of you ever watch any

00:14:52.873 --> 00:14:55.735
sports?
Let's raise some hands

00:14:55.735 --> 00:15:00.642
here--some of you do.
So this is baseball playoff

00:15:00.642 --> 00:15:02.561
season.
How many of you have been

00:15:02.561 --> 00:15:04.892
watching the baseball playoffs?
Raise your hands if you've been

00:15:04.892 --> 00:15:06.251
watching the baseball playoffs.
I'll let you off,

00:15:06.251 --> 00:15:07.750
I know you should have been
doing my homework.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.350
How many of you have been
watching the playoffs instead?

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:11.850
How many watched the Yankees
game last night?

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.845
Quite a few of you.
So they haven't been very

00:15:14.845 --> 00:15:16.693
exciting yet but we're hoping
that it's going to get more

00:15:16.693 --> 00:15:18.582
exciting.
So when you're watching

00:15:18.582 --> 00:15:22.669
baseball what kind of things do
you see where you just know that

00:15:22.669 --> 00:15:25.460
there must be mixed strategies
involved?

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.330
There must be randomization
involved.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:28.470
Now I've got a few more hands
out.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.807
Good, so you sir.
Student: Choosing how to

00:15:30.807 --> 00:15:31.792
pitch the ball.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:15:31.792 --> 00:15:33.976
Choosing how to pitch the ball.
Enlarge a little bit more,

00:15:33.976 --> 00:15:35.968
say a bit more.
Student: Fast ball

00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:37.282
versus slider,
versus change up,

00:15:37.282 --> 00:15:39.797
all sorts of different things.
Prof Ben Polak: All

00:15:39.797 --> 00:15:42.159
right, so there's different ways
of throwing the ball,

00:15:42.159 --> 00:15:45.236
and there's going to be
randomization from the pitcher,

00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:48.596
or at least it's going to look
like there's randomization by

00:15:48.596 --> 00:15:51.729
the pitcher over whether to
throw a fast ball or a curve

00:15:51.729 --> 00:15:55.714
ball or whatever.
How is the hitter randomizing

00:15:55.714 --> 00:15:58.129
there?
How is the hitter randomizing?

00:15:58.129 --> 00:15:59.009
Is the hitter randomizing at
all?

00:15:59.009 --> 00:16:02.550
What's the hitter doing while
this is going on?

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:06.240
Anybody?
Yeah.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.802
Student: He's choosing
whether to swing or not to

00:16:07.802 --> 00:16:08.901
swing.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:10.578
Okay, he's choosing whether to
swing or not to swing,

00:16:10.578 --> 00:16:12.352
although presumably he can do
that just after the ball's

00:16:12.352 --> 00:16:14.065
thrown.
So you sometimes hear the

00:16:14.065 --> 00:16:17.248
commentator say that that hitter
was looking for a fast ball,

00:16:17.248 --> 00:16:19.450
is that right?
Or looking for a curve ball.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.980
The hitter is trying to
anticipate the pitch,

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.904
is that right?
This is not a game I played a

00:16:23.904 --> 00:16:25.220
lot of either--I played a little
bit.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.872
You're trying to anticipate
where the ball is going to be

00:16:28.872 --> 00:16:31.093
thrown.
So the type of ball you throw

00:16:31.093 --> 00:16:34.586
in baseball and the way in which
the pitch being anticipated by

00:16:34.586 --> 00:16:37.289
the hitter, is likely to be a
mixed strategy.

00:16:37.289 --> 00:16:40.910
What else is likely to be a
mixed strategy in baseball?

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:46.075
What else?
Anybody here on the Yale

00:16:46.075 --> 00:16:50.558
baseball team?
Okay, I've got one volunteer

00:16:50.558 --> 00:16:51.990
here.
So what else,

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.449
stand up for a second.
Let's have a Yale baseball team

00:16:55.449 --> 00:16:57.960
member, what's your name?
Student: Chris.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:58.700
Professor Ben Polak:
Where do you play?

00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.802
Student: I'm a pitcher.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:16:59.802 --> 00:17:00.159
You're a pitcher,
okay.

00:17:00.159 --> 00:17:02.223
So he's not going to get on
base now, so he's not going to

00:17:02.223 --> 00:17:05.150
answer this.
Suppose you did get on base,

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.089
pitchers don't often get on
base.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:11.829
Let's assume that happens,
what might you randomize?

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:13.483
There you are,
you're standing on base,

00:17:13.483 --> 00:17:15.561
what might you randomize about?
Student: Whether to

00:17:15.561 --> 00:17:16.837
steal second or not.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:17:16.837 --> 00:17:18.463
Right, whether to steal or not,
whether to try and steal or

00:17:18.463 --> 00:17:20.470
not.
Stay up a second.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:24.447
So the decision whether to try
and steal or not is likely to

00:17:24.447 --> 00:17:28.137
end up being random.
If you're the pitcher,

00:17:28.137 --> 00:17:31.849
what can you do in response to
that?

00:17:31.849 --> 00:17:34.093
Student: You can either
choose to try to pick them off

00:17:34.093 --> 00:17:34.941
or not.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:17:34.941 --> 00:17:35.970
What else?
So one thing you can try and

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:36.619
pick him off.
What else?

00:17:36.619 --> 00:17:37.880
Student: You can be
quicker to the plate.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.079
Professor Ben Polak:
Quicker to the plate,

00:17:39.079 --> 00:17:40.105
what else?
Student: You can pitch

00:17:40.105 --> 00:17:41.796
out.
Professor Ben Polak: You

00:17:41.796 --> 00:17:43.109
can pitch out,
what else?

00:17:43.109 --> 00:17:44.260
At least those three things,
right?

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.982
Student: Yeah.
Professor Ben Polak: At

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:47.190
least those three things okay,
thank you.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:50.009
I have an expert here,
I'm glad I had an expert.

00:17:50.009 --> 00:17:53.967
So in this case we can see
there's randomization going on

00:17:53.967 --> 00:17:57.854
from the runner whether he
attempts to steal the base or

00:17:57.854 --> 00:18:00.198
not,
and by the pitcher on whether

00:18:00.198 --> 00:18:03.510
he throws the pitch out or
whether he tries to throw,

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:09.660
to get to the plate faster.
So we see this in sport.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.317
We don't see it well
anticipated by sports

00:18:12.317 --> 00:18:14.799
commentators.
Let me put this down a second.

00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:16.482
So in baseball,
for example,

00:18:16.482 --> 00:18:19.660
you'll sometimes see quite
sophisticated statistical

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.212
analyses of baseball in which
somebody will have looked at

00:18:23.212 --> 00:18:27.013
base stealers across the major
leagues and they'll look at all

00:18:27.013 --> 00:18:30.689
the instances in which a player
was on first base and in the

00:18:30.689 --> 00:18:33.930
position where you think they
might steal,

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.407
and they'll look at what
happened on every attempt to

00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:39.170
steal, whether they were in fact
caught stealing or not,

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.405
and they'll try and measure the
value of these things and

00:18:41.405 --> 00:18:43.601
they'll see, the conclusion
they'll come to is something

00:18:43.601 --> 00:18:46.001
like this.
They'll conclude that whether

00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:49.113
the guy stole or not,
whether the guy attempted to

00:18:49.113 --> 00:18:51.769
steal or not,
sorry, or whether he just sat

00:18:51.769 --> 00:18:54.710
on first base doesn't seem to
make much difference,

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:57.507
they'll say.
They'll say that the payoff for

00:18:57.507 --> 00:19:01.309
even great base stealers are
attempting to steal or not,

00:19:01.309 --> 00:19:04.956
when you take into account the
pick offs versus just staying

00:19:04.956 --> 00:19:08.602
put, turns out the payoff in
terms of the impact on the game

00:19:08.602 --> 00:19:10.990
is roughly equal,
and then they'll draw-- these

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:12.869
analysts will then draw the
following conclusion.

00:19:12.869 --> 00:19:16.172
They'll say,
oh look, speed or the ability

00:19:16.172 --> 00:19:20.360
to steal bases is therefore
overrated in baseball.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.958
How have they made a mistake?
What's the mistake they made

00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:26.688
there?
So the premise was,

00:19:26.688 --> 00:19:29.811
let's give them the premise,
the premise was that when a

00:19:29.811 --> 00:19:33.274
base stealer is attempting to
steal or not the expected return

00:19:33.274 --> 00:19:36.339
in terms of outcome of the game
is roughly equal,

00:19:36.339 --> 00:19:39.960
whether they attempt to steal
or don't attempt to steal.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.346
The conclusion is,
therefore stealing doesn't seem

00:19:43.346 --> 00:19:47.130
such a big deal.
What's the mistake they've made?

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:51.400
Yeah, let me borrow it again,
sorry.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.799
Student: The pitcher has
to react differently in pitching

00:19:54.799 --> 00:19:57.390
when he knows that there's a
fast guy on base.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.791
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, so our pitcher has to

00:19:58.791 --> 00:20:00.717
react differently.
Let's talk to our pitcher

00:20:00.717 --> 00:20:04.209
again, so one thing our pitcher
said was he wants to get to the

00:20:04.209 --> 00:20:06.835
plate faster.
What does that mean getting to

00:20:06.835 --> 00:20:09.339
the plate faster?
–Shout out so people can

00:20:09.339 --> 00:20:10.695
hear you.
Student: It means just

00:20:10.695 --> 00:20:12.486
getting the ball to the catcher
as fast as possible so he has

00:20:12.486 --> 00:20:13.769
the best chance to throw out the
runner.

00:20:13.769 --> 00:20:16.131
Professor Ben Polak:
Right, so you're going to pitch

00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:18.369
from, you're not going to do
that funny windup thing,

00:20:18.369 --> 00:20:20.187
you're not, thank you,
you're going to pitch from the

00:20:20.187 --> 00:20:21.970
stretch, I knew there was a term
there somewhere.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.960
I'm learning American by being
here.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.295
And you're more likely to throw
a fast ball, there's some

00:20:26.295 --> 00:20:28.839
advantage in throwing a fast
ball rather than a curve ball.

00:20:28.839 --> 00:20:31.719
Both actions of which,
both having to move more

00:20:31.719 --> 00:20:35.349
towards fast balls and pitching
to the stretch are actually

00:20:35.349 --> 00:20:37.899
costly for the pitcher.
But we'll get there in a

00:20:37.899 --> 00:20:39.797
second, let's just back up a
second, so that was good,

00:20:39.797 --> 00:20:41.779
that's right.
But let's just back up a second.

00:20:41.779 --> 00:20:44.470
The premise of these
commentators was what?

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:48.536
It was that the return to
stealing, attempting to steal,

00:20:48.536 --> 00:20:51.855
seems to be roughly a wash.
It seems to be that the

00:20:51.855 --> 00:20:55.025
expected return when this great
base runner attempts to steal a

00:20:55.025 --> 00:20:58.144
base is roughly the same as the
return when they don't attempt

00:20:58.144 --> 00:21:00.749
to steal the base.
But I claim we knew that was

00:21:00.749 --> 00:21:03.073
going to the case.
We didn't have to go and look

00:21:03.073 --> 00:21:06.190
at the data.
Why did we know that was going

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:10.047
to be the case?
How did we know that we were

00:21:10.047 --> 00:21:15.621
bound to find a return in that
analysis that finds those things

00:21:15.621 --> 00:21:18.859
roughly equal?
Yeah.

00:21:18.859 --> 00:21:20.920
Student: If he is
randomizing that means that the

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.967
returns will be equal.
If they weren't equal he would

00:21:22.967 --> 00:21:24.460
just do one or the other all the
time.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.660
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, excellent.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.691
Since we're in a mixed strategy
equilibrium, since he's

00:21:30.691 --> 00:21:35.319
randomizing, it must be the case
that the returns are equal.

00:21:35.319 --> 00:21:38.196
That's the big idea here,
that's the thing we learned

00:21:38.196 --> 00:21:39.495
last time.
If the player,

00:21:39.495 --> 00:21:41.946
and these are professional
baseball players doing this,

00:21:41.946 --> 00:21:45.215
they've been very well trained,
a lot of money has been spent

00:21:45.215 --> 00:21:48.383
on getting the tactics right.
There's people sitting there

00:21:48.383 --> 00:21:50.309
who are paid to get the tactics
right.

00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:53.924
If it was the case that the
return to base stealing wasn't

00:21:53.924 --> 00:21:57.665
roughly equal when you attempt
to steal or didn't attempt to

00:21:57.665 --> 00:21:59.492
steal,
then you shouldn't be

00:21:59.492 --> 00:22:02.293
randomizing.
Since you are randomizing it

00:22:02.293 --> 00:22:06.200
must be the case that the
returns are roughly equal.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.742
So that's the first thing to
observe and the second thing to

00:22:08.742 --> 00:22:10.380
observe is what we just pointed
out.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:15.007
In fact, the value of having a
fast base stealer on the team

00:22:15.007 --> 00:22:19.949
doesn't show up in the expected
return on the occasions on which

00:22:19.949 --> 00:22:23.451
he attempts to steal,
or which he does not attempt to

00:22:23.451 --> 00:22:24.930
steal.
It shows up where?

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.236
It shows up in the fact that
the pitching team changes their

00:22:28.236 --> 00:22:31.374
behavior to make it harder for
this guy to steal by going

00:22:31.374 --> 00:22:34.099
faster to the plate,
or throwing more fast balls.

00:22:34.099 --> 00:22:36.049
Where will that show up in the
statistics?

00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:38.363
If you're just a statistician
like me, you just look at the

00:22:38.363 --> 00:22:40.636
data, where will that show up?
I mean suppose I can't keep

00:22:40.636 --> 00:22:42.702
track of every single pitch,
I can't actually observe all

00:22:42.702 --> 00:22:45.101
these fast balls,
where will I see the effect of

00:22:45.101 --> 00:22:48.480
all these extra fast balls in
pitching and from the stretch,

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:53.329
in the data?
Somebody?

00:22:53.329 --> 00:22:57.702
It's going to show up in the
batting average of the guy who's

00:22:57.702 --> 00:23:01.584
hitting behind the base stealer.
The guy hitting behind the base

00:23:01.584 --> 00:23:04.121
stealer is going to have a
higher batting average because

00:23:04.121 --> 00:23:06.930
he's going to get more pitches
which are fast balls to hit,

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:09.349
and more pitches out of the
stretch.

00:23:09.349 --> 00:23:12.380
So if you ignore that effect,
you're going to be in trouble.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.043
But we know,
if we analyze this properly

00:23:14.043 --> 00:23:15.833
using Game Theory,
we know we're in a mixed

00:23:15.833 --> 00:23:17.891
strategy equilibrium.
We know, in fact,

00:23:17.891 --> 00:23:20.339
the pitching team must be
reacting to it.

00:23:20.339 --> 00:23:24.518
We know there must be a cost in
doing that, and the cost turns

00:23:24.518 --> 00:23:27.348
up in the hitter behind.
So when you're watching the

00:23:27.348 --> 00:23:29.755
playoffs in the last-- now I'm
giving you permission to watch a

00:23:29.755 --> 00:23:32.157
bit of TV at night,
after you've done my homework

00:23:32.157 --> 00:23:35.358
assignment, but before anyone
else's homework assignment--you

00:23:35.358 --> 00:23:38.292
can have a look at these
baseball games and have a go at

00:23:38.292 --> 00:23:41.599
being a little bit better than
the commentators who are working

00:23:41.599 --> 00:23:44.333
on them.
So one application for mixed

00:23:44.333 --> 00:23:48.130
strategies is in sports,
but not the only application.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:50.757
Let's just talk about another
application, a slightly more

00:23:50.757 --> 00:23:54.023
scary application.
So after 9/11 there was a lot

00:23:54.023 --> 00:23:58.458
of talk in the U.S.
about the placement of baggage

00:23:58.458 --> 00:24:02.801
checking machines at airports.
Actually there's still quite a

00:24:02.801 --> 00:24:05.855
lot of talk, but there was a lot
of talk then about the placement

00:24:05.855 --> 00:24:08.480
of machines to search the
luggage that goes onboard.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.723
The hand luggage was being
searched anyway,

00:24:10.723 --> 00:24:13.180
but to search luggage going
into the cabins.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.218
It was pointed out at the time,
this has changed since,

00:24:16.218 --> 00:24:19.200
there weren't actually enough
machines in the U.S.,

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.089
on the day after 9/11,
to search every single bag that

00:24:23.089 --> 00:24:26.208
went into the hold.
You'd hear discussions of the

00:24:26.208 --> 00:24:28.883
following type.
You'd hear these experts on

00:24:28.883 --> 00:24:32.757
Nightline or whatever and they'd
say: look there's no point

00:24:32.757 --> 00:24:35.975
trying to do this,
because if we put all our

00:24:35.975 --> 00:24:39.970
baggage searching machines at
Logan Airport in Boston,

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:42.609
for example,
then the terrorists will simply

00:24:42.609 --> 00:24:46.230
move their attack to O'Hare and
if we put them at O'Hare,

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.009
then they'll move their attack
to Logan.

00:24:48.009 --> 00:24:51.481
If we have enough to do both
Logan and O'Hare then they'll

00:24:51.481 --> 00:24:54.039
move their attack to some third
airport.

00:24:54.039 --> 00:24:56.220
So there was a sense of doom in
the air.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.630
It was kind of a depressing
time anyway.

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:02.736
There was a sense of doom in
the air saying that if you put

00:25:02.736 --> 00:25:06.609
your baggage searching machines
somewhere,

00:25:06.609 --> 00:25:09.142
all you do is cause the
attempted terrorists,

00:25:09.142 --> 00:25:11.790
terrorists attempting to blow
up the planes,

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.123
to go elsewhere.
And you hear the same things

00:25:14.123 --> 00:25:16.434
today about searching
individuals as they go on the

00:25:16.434 --> 00:25:17.734
plane.
For example,

00:25:17.734 --> 00:25:21.860
you'll hear a discussion that
says, if we only search men

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.681
traveling alone,
let's say, then you'll quickly

00:25:25.681 --> 00:25:30.283
end up with all the people
carrying bombs being couples or

00:25:30.283 --> 00:25:32.190
women.
Again, there's this sense of

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:33.960
doom, this sense that says it's
hopeless.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.862
Whatever we do we're just going
to force the terrorists to do

00:25:36.862 --> 00:25:39.330
something else but we won't have
gained anything.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:45.420
So once again that's wrong.
What's wrong about that one?

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.100
What should we be doing in that
setting?

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:51.111
Let me come down again.
What should they have done--in

00:25:51.111 --> 00:25:54.860
fact they did do--with those
luggage/baggage searching

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:58.680
machines when they were in short
supply after 9/11?

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.910
What do they do with searching
people as they got on planes?

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:08.406
What do they do?
Well here's what they didn't

00:26:08.406 --> 00:26:11.144
do, they didn't just put them at
certain airports and announce

00:26:11.144 --> 00:26:13.728
they're just at these airports.
That would have been a crazy

00:26:13.728 --> 00:26:15.706
thing to do.
That would have been

00:26:15.706 --> 00:26:19.200
hopeless--not entirely
hopeless--but not wise.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.510
What should they have done?
What did they do?

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:28.880
Anybody want to guess?
Yeah.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.869
Student: In name they
randomized who they were

00:26:30.869 --> 00:26:32.698
checking.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:26:32.698 --> 00:26:35.776
Right, so when they're checking
passengers, they're going to

00:26:35.776 --> 00:26:38.542
randomly check passengers.
When they're checking,

00:26:38.542 --> 00:26:40.933
when they think about the
baggage machines,

00:26:40.933 --> 00:26:44.121
a sensible thing to do is to
put a big metal box at every

00:26:44.121 --> 00:26:46.968
single airport and say:
we're not going to tell you

00:26:46.968 --> 00:26:50.839
which of these boxes actually
have baggage checking machines,

00:26:50.839 --> 00:26:52.369
which effectively is
randomizing.

00:26:52.369 --> 00:26:56.283
From the point of view of the
terrorists, they're not going to

00:26:56.283 --> 00:26:59.170
know where the baggage checks
are going on.

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:01.705
That's worth doing.
It doesn't--It isn't going to

00:27:01.705 --> 00:27:03.741
perfectly eliminate,
well unfortunately it isn't

00:27:03.741 --> 00:27:06.470
probably going to perfectly
eliminate all terrorist attacks,

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:09.880
but it does make it harder for
the terrorists.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:13.521
So randomization there--whether
it's literally randomizing over

00:27:13.521 --> 00:27:16.306
who is checked,
or whether it's "as it were"

00:27:16.306 --> 00:27:20.197
randomizing, by concealing where
in fact you have placed those

00:27:20.197 --> 00:27:23.749
machines--can be very effective.
The hard thing,

00:27:23.749 --> 00:27:27.706
both in sports and in these
military examples,

00:27:27.706 --> 00:27:30.960
is really mimicking
randomization.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.626
It's very hard for us as humans
to do it, and there's a famous

00:27:34.626 --> 00:27:36.730
story about a military
commander,

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:40.840
actually a English military
commander during an insurgent

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:44.730
war in, I think it was Malaysia
after World War II,

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:48.365
where again he had to worry
about randomizing which convoys

00:27:48.365 --> 00:27:49.879
to protect.
And the way in

00:27:49.879 --> 00:27:52.825
which…--He figured out
that randomizing was the right

00:27:52.825 --> 00:27:55.672
thing to do to try and protect
these convoys as well as he

00:27:55.672 --> 00:27:57.670
could with small numbers of
troops.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.355
And the way in which he
randomized was he

00:27:59.355 --> 00:28:02.455
literally randomized.
Every morning he put a bit of

00:28:02.455 --> 00:28:05.745
paper in his hand and he had
somebody, had one of his

00:28:05.745 --> 00:28:08.720
sergeants, pick which hand the
paper was in.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.750
So we do actually see these
random strategies used.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.965
The reason we have to literally
randomize is because it's very

00:28:14.965 --> 00:28:18.339
difficult to do so unless you're
a professional sports player.

00:28:18.339 --> 00:28:21.781
Okay, but it turns out that
mixed strategy equilibria,

00:28:21.781 --> 00:28:23.990
and mixed strategies in
general,

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:27.517
are relevant beyond just these
contexts in which you think of

00:28:27.517 --> 00:28:34.573
people literally randomizing.
I want to look at a different

00:28:34.573 --> 00:28:39.356
context now.
So I want to go back to a game

00:28:39.356 --> 00:28:42.580
we started a few weeks ago.
This isn't the same game.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.714
It's a sequel.
It's a follow up in our

00:28:44.714 --> 00:28:47.980
exciting adventure of our dating
couple in the classroom.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:52.029
Who were our dating couple,
do we still have them here?

00:28:52.029 --> 00:28:54.536
That was the guy,
who is the--yeah,

00:28:54.536 --> 00:28:57.090
there they are.
They're even sitting closer.

00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:01.720
What a success here.
Can we get the camera on them a

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:08.620
second?
Stand up a second, thank you.

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.809
Your name was?
Student: David.

00:29:11.809 --> 00:29:16.200
Professor Ben Polak:
David.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.940
And look at this.
Is this romantic or what?

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.980
David and your name is?
Student: Nina.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.857
Professor Ben Polak:
Nina and David,

00:29:22.857 --> 00:29:25.168
okay.
I think we pretty much figured

00:29:25.168 --> 00:29:28.897
out last time that Nina's Player
I and David's Player II,

00:29:28.897 --> 00:29:31.526
is that right?
As we remember last time,

00:29:31.526 --> 00:29:34.940
I'll pick on you in a second,
you can sit down a second.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.097
So we figured out last time
that they were going to try and

00:29:38.097 --> 00:29:41.200
go on a date and they had
arranged to go to the movies.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.520
They picked out two,
in fact three movies,

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.576
but two that remained viable,
and the problem was being

00:29:46.576 --> 00:29:48.670
typical Economics majors who
are,

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:50.890
are you both Economics majors,
I think we figured that out?

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:52.859
They are, look at that,
so being typical Economics

00:29:52.859 --> 00:29:55.230
majors who are just hopeless at
dating they had forgotten to

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:57.200
tell each other which movie
they're going to.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.977
So that, I don't know if that
worked out well or not,

00:29:59.977 --> 00:30:03.652
but now that life has moved on,
they're going to try it again,

00:30:03.652 --> 00:30:07.160
but this time taking advantage
of fall in New England,

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.227
rather than go to a movie,
they've decided on some new

00:30:10.227 --> 00:30:15.796
activities.
So they might either go apple

00:30:15.796 --> 00:30:25.430
picking or they might go to the
Yale Rep and see a play..

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:31.768
And so apple picking has its
advantages: the fall weather,

00:30:31.768 --> 00:30:37.216
it's local flavor,
it has certain undertones about

00:30:37.216 --> 00:30:43.011
the Garden of Eden or something.
I don't know if you can use the

00:30:43.011 --> 00:30:46.537
term flavor, local or otherwise,
for American apples but never

00:30:46.537 --> 00:30:47.889
mind.
And the Yale Rep,

00:30:47.889 --> 00:30:50.140
Yale Rep is a good thing to do
in New Haven,

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.182
go to a play,
I think it's Richard II is

00:30:52.182 --> 00:30:55.035
showing now, is that it?
Probably not a great "date

00:30:55.035 --> 00:30:57.962
play" but Economists are trying
to show they have culture,

00:30:57.962 --> 00:31:02.050
so there it goes.
And let's assume the payoffs

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:05.733
are like this.
Much as they were before,

00:31:05.733 --> 00:31:10.720
whereby we mean that Nina wants
to meet David but she would,

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:15.087
given the choice she would
rather meet David in the apple

00:31:15.087 --> 00:31:17.251
fields.
And David who's a dark

00:31:17.251 --> 00:31:21.170
personality, likes the sort of
darker side of Shakespeare.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:26.253
And he also wants to meet Nina
but he would rather meet at the

00:31:26.253 --> 00:31:29.439
Yale Rep.
If that's backwards I apologize

00:31:29.439 --> 00:31:32.127
to their preferences.
But once again,

00:31:32.127 --> 00:31:35.719
because they're still
incompetent Economics majors,

00:31:35.719 --> 00:31:40.460
they've again forgotten to tell
each other where they're going.

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:43.575
So let's analyze this game
again, we've figured out this

00:31:43.575 --> 00:31:46.859
was a coordination game last
time or several weeks ago.,

00:31:46.859 --> 00:31:51.309
And we know in this game,
we know what the pure strategy

00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:55.243
Nash Equilibria are,
so no prizes to be able to spot

00:31:55.243 --> 00:31:58.953
them.
One of the Nash Equilibria in

00:31:58.953 --> 00:32:03.269
pure strategies,
let's put this in pure

00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:06.674
strategies,
so one of the pure strategy

00:32:06.674 --> 00:32:10.907
Nash Equilibria is for them both
to go apple picking and meet up

00:32:10.907 --> 00:32:16.650
in Bishop's Orchard or whatever,
and another pure strategy

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:23.160
equilibrium is for them both to
choose the Rep.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.753
We'd figured out that if they
were able to communicate,

00:32:26.753 --> 00:32:30.346
there's really a pretty good
chance of them managing to

00:32:30.346 --> 00:32:34.140
coordinate at one of these
equilibria but we suspect,

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.039
I think, that this is not all
that's going on here.

00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:40.830
It looks quite likely that come
your next Saturday afternoon,

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:43.609
when we send these guys out on
their date,

00:32:43.609 --> 00:32:46.660
they're going to fail to meet,
it's at least plausible.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.059
To test the plausibility of
that, let's ask them,

00:32:49.059 --> 00:32:51.210
have you been,
have you managed to meet on a

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:52.886
date yet?
No, haven't managed to meet on

00:32:52.886 --> 00:32:55.400
a date.
See, so I'm proving the point

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.650
that in fact they haven't
managed to at least coordinate

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:02.962
an equilibrium yet.
So it seems at least plausible

00:33:02.962 --> 00:33:05.220
that they're going to fail to
coordinate.

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:08.529
It's plausible they're going to
fail to coordinate.

00:33:08.529 --> 00:33:11.329
We'd like to sort of capture
that idea, and the way we're

00:33:11.329 --> 00:33:14.230
going to capture that idea
is--let's see if there's another

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:16.666
equilibrium in this game.
Well, there certainly isn't

00:33:16.666 --> 00:33:18.421
another pure strategy
equilibrium in this game is

00:33:18.421 --> 00:33:20.420
there?
We know that..

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.579
So if there's another
equilibrium it better be mixed.

00:33:23.579 --> 00:33:31.734
So let's try and find a mixed
Nash Equilibrium in this game,

00:33:31.734 --> 00:33:38.921
and remember this game is
called Battle of the Sexes,

00:33:38.921 --> 00:33:45.069
it's a famous game.
This is Battle of the Sexes

00:33:45.069 --> 00:33:48.380
revisited.
So how are we going to go about

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:51.700
finding this mixed Nash
Equilibrium in the game?

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:55.599
We'll interpret it later but
let's just work on finding it.

00:33:55.599 --> 00:34:02.447
So, in particular,
I'm going to postulate the idea

00:34:02.447 --> 00:34:10.693
that Nina is going to mix P,
1 - P and David is going to mix

00:34:10.693 --> 00:34:15.148
Q, 1 - Q.
So how do we go about finding

00:34:15.148 --> 00:34:18.150
David's equilibrium mix Q,
1--Q?

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:21.769
What's our trick from last week?
Should be able to cold call at

00:34:21.769 --> 00:34:23.179
this point, but let's not have
to.

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:27.660
How am I going to find Q,
the equilibrium Q?

00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:32.840
Somebody?
Thank you, they can use Venus'

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.306
payoffs, good.
So to find--it isn't Venus'

00:34:36.306 --> 00:34:39.489
payoffs--it's Nina's payoffs.
Fair enough, sorry.

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:49.349
So to find the Nash Equilibrium
Q, to find the mix that David's

00:34:49.349 --> 00:35:02.739
using we use Nina's payoffs.
So let's do that.

00:35:02.739 --> 00:35:09.510
So, in particular,
for Nina, if she goes apple

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:18.387
picking then her payoff is 2
with probability Q if she meets

00:35:18.387 --> 00:35:26.079
David and 0 otherwise.
If she goes to the Rep then her

00:35:26.079 --> 00:35:33.029
payoff is 1 if she meets David,
sorry, need to be careful,

00:35:33.029 --> 00:35:37.394
let's do it again.
If she goes to the Rep her

00:35:37.394 --> 00:35:41.559
payoff is 0 if David goes apple
picking with probability Q,

00:35:41.559 --> 00:35:44.839
and her payoff is 1 if she
meets David at the Rep,

00:35:44.839 --> 00:35:47.450
which happens with probability
1 - Q,

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:52.369
is that correct?
So this is her payoff from

00:35:52.369 --> 00:35:55.369
apple picking and this is her
payoff from seeing Richard II.

00:35:55.369 --> 00:36:00.880
And what do we know if Nina is
indeed mixing,

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:06.140
what do we know about these two
payoffs?

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:09.623
They must be equal.
If Nina is in fact mixing,

00:36:09.623 --> 00:36:12.730
then these two things must be
equal.

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:23.561
And that means:
what we're saying is 2Q equals

00:36:23.561 --> 00:36:33.190
1(1-Q) or Q equals 2/3,
I guess it is.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:43.150
No it's 1/3 sorry.
Is that right?

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:46.705
Q is 1/3.
Okay, so our guess is that if

00:36:46.705 --> 00:36:51.116
there's a mixed strategy
equilibrium it must be the case

00:36:51.116 --> 00:36:55.527
that David is assigning a
probability 1/3 to going apple

00:36:55.527 --> 00:36:59.511
picking,
which means he's assigning

00:36:59.511 --> 00:37:06.074
probability 2/3 to his more
favored activity which is going

00:37:06.074 --> 00:37:14.316
to see Richard II.
What about, I'm going to pull

00:37:14.316 --> 00:37:23.014
these both down,
okay, how do we find Nina's

00:37:23.014 --> 00:37:29.672
mix?
So to find the Nash Equilibrium

00:37:29.672 --> 00:37:35.930
P, to find Nina's mix what do we
do?

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:39.270
What's the trick?
Somebody?

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:44.224
Use David's payoffs.
So David's payoffs,

00:37:44.224 --> 00:37:51.575
if he goes apple picking then
he gets a payoff of 1 if he

00:37:51.575 --> 00:37:59.452
meets Nina there and 0 otherwise
and if he goes to the Rep he

00:37:59.452 --> 00:38:06.409
gets a payoff of 0 if Nina's
gone apple picking,

00:38:06.409 --> 00:38:13.900
and he gets a payoff of 2 if he
meets Nina at the Rep.

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:17.745
Once again, if David is
indifferent it must be that

00:38:17.745 --> 00:38:20.920
these are equal.
So if these are-- if David is

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:24.623
in fact mixing between apple
picking and going to the Rep--it

00:38:24.623 --> 00:38:28.574
must be that these two are equal
and if we set this out carefully

00:38:28.574 --> 00:38:32.594
we'll get,
let's just see,

00:38:32.594 --> 00:38:44.561
we'll get 1(P) equals 2(1-P),
which is P equals 2/3 and 1-P

00:38:44.561 --> 00:38:50.584
equals 1/3.
So here we have Nina assigning

00:38:50.584 --> 00:38:56.018
2/3 to going apple picking,
which in fact is her more

00:38:56.018 --> 00:39:00.719
favored thing and 1/3 to going
to the Rep.

00:39:00.719 --> 00:39:05.332
Okay, so we just used the same
trick as last time,

00:39:05.332 --> 00:39:10.039
let's check that this is in
fact an equilibrium.

00:39:10.039 --> 00:39:15.199
So, in particular,
let's check that it is in fact

00:39:15.199 --> 00:39:19.930
an equilibrium for Nina to
choose 2/3,1/3.

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:28.484
Let's check.
So check that P equals 2/3 is

00:39:28.484 --> 00:39:34.970
in fact the best response for
Nina.

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:41.876
Let's go back to Nina's payoffs.
For Nina, if she chose to go

00:39:41.876 --> 00:39:48.073
apple picking,
her payoff now is 2 times Q but

00:39:48.073 --> 00:39:56.336
Q is equal to 1/3 plus 0(1-Q)
and if she chooses to go to the

00:39:56.336 --> 00:40:03.911
Rep then her payoff is 0 with
probability 1/3 and 1 with

00:40:03.911 --> 00:40:10.778
probability now 2/3.
All I've done is I've taken the

00:40:10.778 --> 00:40:16.160
lines I had before and
substituted in now what we know

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:22.152
must be the correct Q and 1-Q
and this gives her a payoff of

00:40:22.152 --> 00:40:26.808
2/3 in either case.
If she chooses P,

00:40:26.808 --> 00:40:34.637
her payoff to P will be 2/3 of
the time she'll get the payoff

00:40:34.637 --> 00:40:42.596
from apple picking which is 2/3
and 1/3 of the time she'll get

00:40:42.596 --> 00:40:51.730
the payoff from going to the Rep
which is 2/3 for a total of 2/3.

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:55.329
So Nina's payoff from either of
her pure strategies is 2/3.

00:40:55.329 --> 00:40:59.835
Her payoff from our claimed
equilibrium mixed strategy is

00:40:59.835 --> 00:41:04.663
2/3, so neither of her possible
pure strategy deviations were

00:41:04.663 --> 00:41:07.000
profitable.
She didn't lose her anything

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.260
either, but they weren't
profitable, and by the lesson we

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:12.318
started the class with,
that means there cannot be any

00:41:12.318 --> 00:41:15.129
strictly profitable mixed
deviation either,

00:41:15.129 --> 00:41:19.824
so indeed,
for Nina, P is a best response

00:41:19.824 --> 00:41:22.753
to Q.
We can do the same for David

00:41:22.753 --> 00:41:25.690
but let's not bother,
it's symmetric.

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:29.960
So in this game we found
another equilibrium.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:38.043
The other equilibrium,
the new equilibrium is Nina

00:41:38.043 --> 00:41:47.446
mixed 2/3,1/3 and David mixed
1/3,2/3 and we also know the

00:41:47.446 --> 00:41:57.781
payoff from this equilibrium.
The equilibrium from this

00:41:57.781 --> 00:42:04.630
payoff, for both players,
was 2/3.

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:06.519
There are three equilibria in
this game.

00:42:06.519 --> 00:42:09.148
They managed to meet at apple
picking in which case the

00:42:09.148 --> 00:42:11.577
payoffs are 2 and 1.
They managed to meet at the

00:42:11.577 --> 00:42:14.090
Rep, that's the second pure
strategy equilibrium,

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:17.283
in which case the payoffs are 1
and 2, or they mixed,

00:42:17.283 --> 00:42:24.949
both of them mixed in this way,
and their payoffs are 2/3,2/3.

00:42:24.949 --> 00:42:30.849
Why is the payoff so bad in
this mixed strategy equilibrium?

00:42:30.849 --> 00:42:33.840
Does everyone agree,
this is a pretty lousy payoff?

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:37.393
The other equilibrium payoffs
the worst you got was 1 and you

00:42:37.393 --> 00:42:40.038
sometimes got 2,
but now here you are playing a

00:42:40.038 --> 00:42:42.879
different equilibrium and at
this different equilibrium

00:42:42.879 --> 00:42:45.747
you're only getting 2/3.
Why are you only getting--what

00:42:45.747 --> 00:42:47.880
happened?
Why have these payoffs got

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:51.135
pushed down so far?
What's happening to our poor

00:42:51.135 --> 00:42:53.880
hapless couple?
Or not hapless I don't know.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:43:02.025
What's happening to our couple?
Student: Sometimes they

00:43:02.025 --> 00:43:03.454
don't meet.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:43:03.454 --> 00:43:06.297
Yeah, they're failing to meet.
The reason, what's forcing

00:43:06.297 --> 00:43:09.780
these payoffs down is they're
not meeting very often?

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.560
How often are they actually
meeting?

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.889
How often are they meeting?
Let's have a look.

00:43:15.889 --> 00:43:25.829
Let's go back to the previous
board.

00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:31.407
Here it is..So they meet when
they end up in this box or this

00:43:31.407 --> 00:43:34.394
box, is that right?
So what's the probability of

00:43:34.394 --> 00:43:39.138
them ending in those boxes?
Well ending up in this box is

00:43:39.138 --> 00:43:46.684
probability 2/3,1/3 and ending
up in this box is probability

00:43:46.684 --> 00:43:51.688
1/3,2/3, is that right?
You end up meeting apple

00:43:51.688 --> 00:43:55.743
picking, the 2/3 of the time
when Nina goes there times the

00:43:55.743 --> 00:43:58.610
1/3 of the time when David goes
there.

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:02.377
And you end up meeting at the
Rep the 1/3 of the time Nina

00:44:02.377 --> 00:44:06.409
goes there times the 2/3 of the
time that David goes there.

00:44:06.409 --> 00:44:22.434
So this is the total
probability of meeting and it's

00:44:22.434 --> 00:44:31.860
equal to 4/9,
is that right?

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:35.964
So 4/9 of the time they're
meeting, but 5/9 of the

00:44:35.964 --> 00:44:40.404
time--more than half the
time--they're screwing up and

00:44:40.404 --> 00:44:45.460
failing to meet.
This is why I call them a

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:49.902
hapless dating couple.
So this is a very bad

00:44:49.902 --> 00:44:53.518
equilibrium, but it captures
something which is true about

00:44:53.518 --> 00:44:55.788
the game.
What is surely true about this

00:44:55.788 --> 00:44:58.855
game is that if they just played
this game, they wouldn't meet

00:44:58.855 --> 00:45:01.742
all the time.
In fact what we're arguing here

00:45:01.742 --> 00:45:04.630
is they'd meet less than half of
the time.

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:07.114
But certainly this idea that
we're given from the pure

00:45:07.114 --> 00:45:09.223
strategy equilibria,
that they would magically

00:45:09.223 --> 00:45:11.380
always manage to meet seems very
unlikely,

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:14.962
so this does seem to add a
little bit of realism to this

00:45:14.962 --> 00:45:18.712
analysis of the game.
However, it leads to a bit of

00:45:18.712 --> 00:45:22.486
an interpretation problem.
You might ask the question why

00:45:22.486 --> 00:45:24.890
on Earth are they randomizing in
this way.

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:27.520
Why are they doing this?
It's bad for everybody.

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:33.840
Why are they doing this?
This leads us to think about a

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:37.445
second interpretation for what
we think mixed strategy

00:45:37.445 --> 00:45:40.655
equilibria are.
Rather than thinking of them

00:45:40.655 --> 00:45:44.412
literally as randomizing,
it's probably better in this

00:45:44.412 --> 00:45:47.389
case to think about the
following idea.

00:45:47.389 --> 00:45:53.074
We need to think about David's
mixture as being a statement

00:45:53.074 --> 00:45:57.679
about what Nina believes David's
going to do.

00:45:57.679 --> 00:46:01.030
David may not be literally
randomizing.

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:05.009
But his mixture Q,
1--Q, we could think of as

00:46:05.009 --> 00:46:09.260
Nina's belief about what David's
going to do.

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:14.329
Conversely, Nina may not
literally be randomizing.

00:46:14.329 --> 00:46:19.049
But her P, 1 - P,
we could think of as David's

00:46:19.049 --> 00:46:23.139
belief about what Nina's going
to do.

00:46:23.139 --> 00:46:28.542
And what we've done is we've
found the beliefs such that

00:46:28.542 --> 00:46:34.239
these players are exactly
indifferent over what they do.

00:46:34.239 --> 00:46:37.790
We found the beliefs for David
over what Nina's going to do,

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:41.099
such that David doesn't really
quite know what to do.

00:46:41.099 --> 00:46:44.654
And we found the beliefs that
Nina holds about what David's

00:46:44.654 --> 00:46:48.270
going to do such that Nina
doesn't quite know what to do.

00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:54.270
That make sense?
So it's probably better here to

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:58.954
think about this not as people
literally randomizing but these

00:46:58.954 --> 00:47:02.870
mixed strategies being a
statement about what people

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:06.742
believe in equilibrium.
We'll come back and look at

00:47:06.742 --> 00:47:10.380
this game some more later on,
so our couple I'm afraid are

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:14.156
not quite out of the woods yet.
But I want to spend the rest of

00:47:14.156 --> 00:47:17.264
today looking at yet another
interpretation of mixed strategy

00:47:17.264 --> 00:47:20.035
equilibria.
So, so far we have two,

00:47:20.035 --> 00:47:23.769
we have people are literally
randomizing.

00:47:23.769 --> 00:47:27.004
We have thinking of these as
expressions about what people

00:47:27.004 --> 00:47:30.182
believe in equilibrium rather
than what they're literally

00:47:30.182 --> 00:47:38.886
doing.
And now I'm going to give you a

00:47:38.886 --> 00:47:50.249
third interpretation.
So for now we can get rid of

00:47:50.249 --> 00:47:58.597
the Venus and Serena game.
So to motivate this third idea

00:47:58.597 --> 00:48:01.949
I want to think about tax
audits.

00:48:01.949 --> 00:48:04.031
So none of you here have ever,
probably ever,

00:48:04.031 --> 00:48:06.727
had to fill out a tax form,
except for the fact that there

00:48:06.727 --> 00:48:09.139
seems to be a lot of parents in
the room today,

00:48:09.139 --> 00:48:11.559
is it parents weekend,
is that what's going on?

00:48:11.559 --> 00:48:13.110
So where are the parents in the
room?

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:16.059
Wave your arms in the air if
you're a parent here.

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:19.149
So at least these guys at
probably some point in their

00:48:19.149 --> 00:48:21.931
life filled out a tax form.
So come tax day,

00:48:21.931 --> 00:48:25.954
the parents in the room face a
choice, and the choice is are

00:48:25.954 --> 00:48:30.115
they going to honestly fill out
their taxes, or are they going

00:48:30.115 --> 00:48:33.642
to cheat?
I'm not going to ask them what

00:48:33.642 --> 00:48:38.102
they, well maybe I will,
but for now I won't ask them

00:48:38.102 --> 00:48:41.519
what they did.
So they can choose one of two

00:48:41.519 --> 00:48:44.090
things.
They can choose to pay their

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:47.570
taxes honestly--we'll call that
H--or to cheat.

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:54.000
This is the tax payer,
the parent.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.694
And at the same time the audit
office, the auditor,

00:48:57.694 --> 00:49:01.240
has to make a choice,
and the auditor's choice is

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:05.821
whether to audit you or not and
it's not literally true because

00:49:05.821 --> 00:49:10.255
literally the auditor can wait
until your tax return comes in

00:49:10.255 --> 00:49:13.579
and then decide whether to audit
you.

00:49:13.579 --> 00:49:16.990
But for now let's think of
these choices being made

00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:20.127
simultaneously,
and we'll see why that makes it

00:49:20.127 --> 00:49:24.606
more interesting.
So let me put down some payoffs

00:49:24.606 --> 00:49:36.410
here and then I'll explain them.
So 2,0, 4, -10,4, 0 and 0,4.

00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:39.257
So how do we interpret this?
Let's look at the auditor's

00:49:39.257 --> 00:49:42.829
payoffs first of all.
So the auditor is very happy

00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:47.717
not having to audit your parents
and having your parents pay

00:49:47.717 --> 00:49:51.280
taxes, so we'll give that a
payoff of 4.

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.325
It'll turn out,
in this game,

00:49:53.325 --> 00:49:57.417
we've decided in the payoffs,
that the auditor is equally

00:49:57.417 --> 00:50:01.581
happy if she actually audits
your parents in the year that

00:50:01.581 --> 00:50:05.354
they cheated.
We'll say that makes the

00:50:05.354 --> 00:50:10.627
auditor equally happy.
Now the auditor is not so happy

00:50:10.627 --> 00:50:16.410
if she audits your parents when
they're honest because audits

00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:20.882
are costly.
The auditor is really unhappy

00:50:20.882 --> 00:50:26.050
if she fails to audit when the
parents cheated.

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:28.138
Let's look at the--I keep
wanting to call them parents--I

00:50:28.138 --> 00:50:29.927
should stop calling them
parents, let's call them

00:50:29.927 --> 00:50:31.644
taxpayers.
So for the taxpayers,

00:50:31.644 --> 00:50:35.281
what are their payoffs?
Well we'll normalize things,

00:50:35.281 --> 00:50:39.500
so if they're honest we'll give
them a payoff of 0.

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.053
That means they correctly fill
in their tax form and pay what

00:50:42.053 --> 00:50:44.815
they're supposed to pay,
but if they can conceal some of

00:50:44.815 --> 00:50:47.059
their income,
they pretend to have whatever

00:50:47.059 --> 00:50:48.673
it is,
a third child,

00:50:48.673 --> 00:50:52.719
then they might be in trouble
if they're audited.

00:50:52.719 --> 00:50:56.056
If they're audited they're
going to have to pay a big fine,

00:50:56.056 --> 00:50:58.300
maybe even go to jail,
so that's -10.

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:02.194
Of course if they're not
audited they get to keep a chunk

00:51:02.194 --> 00:51:06.232
of money so we'll call that 4.
Everyone understand the basic

00:51:06.232 --> 00:51:08.643
idea of this game?
In reality, we could add more

00:51:08.643 --> 00:51:10.372
complications,
we could think of different

00:51:10.372 --> 00:51:13.085
ways to cheat on your taxes,
but I don't want to give

00:51:13.085 --> 00:51:15.780
tutorials on how to cheat on
your taxes here.

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:19.448
So it's not going to take long
staring at this game to figure

00:51:19.448 --> 00:51:22.689
out that there are no pure
strategy equilibria in this

00:51:22.689 --> 00:51:24.681
game.
Let's just do that,

00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:29.155
so from the taxpayer's point of
view, if they're going to be

00:51:29.155 --> 00:51:32.415
audited,
then they'd rather pay their

00:51:32.415 --> 00:51:36.313
taxes than not,
and if they're not going to be

00:51:36.313 --> 00:51:41.769
audited then according to these
payoffs they'd rather cheat.

00:51:41.769 --> 00:51:45.095
From the auditor's point of
view, if they knew everyone was

00:51:45.095 --> 00:51:48.265
going to pay taxes,
then they wouldn't bother

00:51:48.265 --> 00:51:52.590
auditing and if they knew
everyone was going to cheat,

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:59.233
then they'd of course audit.
So you can quickly see that

00:51:59.233 --> 00:52:02.828
there's no box in which the best
responses coincide,

00:52:02.828 --> 00:52:05.929
there's no pure strategy Nash
Equilibria.

00:52:05.929 --> 00:52:08.754
For those people who are
thinking this is seeming other

00:52:08.754 --> 00:52:11.840
worldly, you will have to pay
taxes in a couple of years,

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:16.829
and trust me your parents are
paying taxes now.

00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:20.139
So what we want to do here is
we're going to solve out and

00:52:20.139 --> 00:52:22.230
find a mixed strategy
equilibrium,

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:25.320
but we're going to give it a
different interpretation to the

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:27.659
equilibria we found so far.
But the basic,

00:52:27.659 --> 00:52:31.846
initial exercise is what?
We're going to find--we're

00:52:31.846 --> 00:52:36.360
going to try and find the
equilibrium here.

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:41.283
So to find the Nash Equilibrium
here we know it's going to be

00:52:41.283 --> 00:52:44.509
mixed.
So to find the probability with

00:52:44.509 --> 00:52:49.151
which taxpayers pay their
taxes--and let me already start

00:52:49.151 --> 00:52:54.207
getting ahead of myself and just
say to find the proportion of

00:52:54.207 --> 00:52:59.429
taxpayers who are going to pay
their taxes--what do we do?

00:52:59.429 --> 00:53:03.732
What must be true of that
equilibrium proportion Q of

00:53:03.732 --> 00:53:08.790
taxpayers who pay their taxes?
How am I going to find that Q?

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:13.299
Shout it out somebody.
Yeah look at the auditor's

00:53:13.299 --> 00:53:19.179
payoffs.
So from the auditor's point of

00:53:19.179 --> 00:53:29.444
view, if the auditor audits,
their payoff is 2Q plus 4(1-Q)

00:53:29.444 --> 00:53:39.710
and if they don't audit their
payoff is 4Q plus 0(1-Q).

00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:44.573
Everyone see how I do this,
this is 2Q plus 4(1-Q) and this

00:53:44.573 --> 00:53:50.183
is 4Q plus 0(1-Q).
And if indeed the auditor is

00:53:50.183 --> 00:53:54.960
mixing, then these must be
equal.

00:53:54.960 --> 00:54:06.053
And if they're equal,
let's just do a little bit of

00:54:06.053 --> 00:54:19.366
algebra here and we'll find that
2Q equals 4(1-Q) so Q equals

00:54:19.366 --> 00:54:26.353
2/3, is that right?
So our claim is to make the

00:54:26.353 --> 00:54:30.610
auditor exactly indifferent
between whether to audit or not,

00:54:30.610 --> 00:54:35.819
it must be the case that 2/3 of
the parents of the kids in the

00:54:35.819 --> 00:54:40.260
room, are going to be paying
their taxes honestly,

00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:43.073
which means 1/3 aren't,
which is kind of worrying,

00:54:43.073 --> 00:54:45.624
but never mind.
Let's have a look at the

00:54:45.624 --> 00:54:50.320
taxpayer.
To find, sorry.

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.550
We found the taxpayer,
we found the proportion of

00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:55.291
taxpayers who are paying their
taxes, now I want to find out

00:54:55.291 --> 00:54:57.010
the probability of being
audited.

00:54:57.010 --> 00:55:01.458
How do I figure out the
equilibrium probability of being

00:55:01.458 --> 00:55:05.313
audited in this model?
How do I work out the

00:55:05.313 --> 00:55:09.140
equilibrium probability of being
audited?

00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:13.560
Shout it out.
So the equilibrium probability

00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:16.514
of being audited are going to
use P and 1-P,

00:55:16.514 --> 00:55:20.087
so P is going to be the
probability of being audited,

00:55:20.087 --> 00:55:23.005
how do I find P?
Yeah, I'm going to look at the

00:55:23.005 --> 00:55:29.334
taxpayer's payoffs.
So from the taxpayer's point of

00:55:29.334 --> 00:55:40.024
view, if the taxpayer pays their
taxes, their payoff is just 0,

00:55:40.024 --> 00:55:49.679
and if they cheat they're
payoff is -10P plus 4(1-P).

00:55:49.679 --> 00:55:53.639
And if indeed the taxpayers are
mixing--or in other words,

00:55:53.639 --> 00:55:57.530
we are saying that not all
taxpayers are cheating and not

00:55:57.530 --> 00:56:01.420
all taxpayers are honestly
paying their taxes--then these

00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:07.131
must be equal.
So if these are equal I'm going

00:56:07.131 --> 00:56:14.518
to get 4P equals 14--no it
didn't-- I'm going to get 4

00:56:14.518 --> 00:56:18.000
equals 14P,
let's try again,

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.540
4 equals 14P,
that was a bit worrying,

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:25.559
4 equals 14P,
which is the same as saying P

00:56:25.559 --> 00:56:29.626
equals 2/7.
If somebody can just check my

00:56:29.626 --> 00:56:34.789
algebra I think that's right.
So my claim is that the

00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:41.634
equilibrium here is for 2/3 of
the taxpayers to pay their taxes

00:56:41.634 --> 00:56:45.057
and for the audits,
the auditor,

00:56:45.057 --> 00:56:49.902
to audit 2/7 of the time.
Now we could go back in here

00:56:49.902 --> 00:56:52.639
and we could check,
I could do what I did before,

00:56:52.639 --> 00:56:56.397
I could plug the Ps and Qs in
here and check that in fact this

00:56:56.397 --> 00:56:59.920
is an equilibrium,
but trust me that I've done

00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:04.576
that, trust me that it's okay.
So here we have an equilibrium,

00:57:04.576 --> 00:57:06.800
let's just write down what it
is.

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:12.259
From the auditor's point of
view it is that they audit 2/7

00:57:12.259 --> 00:57:16.090
of the time, or 2/7 of the
population,

00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:21.511
and from the taxpayers' point
of view, it's that they pay

00:57:21.511 --> 00:57:27.030
their taxes honestly 2/3 of the
time and not otherwise.

00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:31.150
Now without focusing too much
on these exact numbers for a

00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:35.054
second, I want to focus first
for a minute on how do we

00:57:35.054 --> 00:57:38.380
interpret this mixed strategy
equilibrium.

00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:41.862
So from the point of view of
the auditor we're really back

00:57:41.862 --> 00:57:45.589
where we were before with the
base stealer or the person who's

00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:47.849
searching baggage at the
airport.

00:57:47.849 --> 00:57:53.199
We could think of the auditor
literally as randomizing.

00:57:53.199 --> 00:57:54.730
In fact, there's some truth to
that.

00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:59.030
It actually is the case that by
law, that the auditor's

00:57:59.030 --> 00:58:03.409
literally have to randomize.
So this 2/7,5/7 this has the

00:58:03.409 --> 00:58:06.110
same interpretation as we had
before.

00:58:06.110 --> 00:58:11.550
This is really a randomization.
But this 2/3,1/3 has a

00:58:11.550 --> 00:58:15.233
different interpretation and a
potentially exciting

00:58:15.233 --> 00:58:18.688
interpretation.
It isn't that we think that

00:58:18.688 --> 00:58:23.341
your parents get to tax day,
work out what their taxes would

00:58:23.341 --> 00:58:26.443
be and then toss a coin.
They may be doing that,

00:58:26.443 --> 00:58:28.770
I'm looking at the parents and
I don't think that's what

00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:31.005
they're doing.
The interpretation here is that

00:58:31.005 --> 00:58:33.741
the parents, some parents are
paying their taxes and some

00:58:33.741 --> 00:58:35.550
parents aren't paying their
taxes.

00:58:35.550 --> 00:58:38.446
There's a lot of parents out
there, a lot of potential

00:58:38.446 --> 00:58:40.360
taxpayers, and in the
population,

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:43.329
in equilibrium,
if these numbers were true,

00:58:43.329 --> 00:58:47.500
2/3, of parents would be paying
their taxes and 1/3 would be

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:52.174
cheating.
So this is a randomization by a

00:58:52.174 --> 00:58:58.110
player, and this is a mixture in
the population.

00:58:58.110 --> 00:59:01.372
The new interpretation here is,
we could think of the mixed

00:59:01.372 --> 00:59:03.510
strategy not as players
randomizing,

00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:06.433
but as a mix in a large
population of which some people

00:59:06.433 --> 00:59:09.789
are doing one thing and the
other group are doing the other.

00:59:09.789 --> 00:59:14.949
It's a proportion of people
paying taxes.

00:59:14.949 --> 00:59:17.804
So I don't know if this 2/3,1/3
is an accurate number for the

00:59:17.804 --> 00:59:19.777
U.S.
It's probably not very far off

00:59:19.777 --> 00:59:22.403
actually.
For Italy I'm ashamed to say

00:59:22.403 --> 00:59:26.309
the number of people who pay
taxes is more like 40%,

00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:29.749
maybe even lower now,
and there are countries I think

00:59:29.749 --> 00:59:32.800
where it gets as high as 90%.
I think the U.S.

00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:39.000
rate when they end up auditing
is a little higher than this but

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.496
not much.
So again, we're going to think

00:59:42.496 --> 00:59:46.809
of this not as randomization but
as a prediction of the

00:59:46.809 --> 00:59:51.441
proportion of American taxpayers
who are going to pay their

00:59:51.441 --> 00:59:54.565
taxes.
Now, I want to use this example

00:59:54.565 --> 00:59:58.188
in the time we have left,
to actually think about a

00:59:58.188 --> 01:00:06.303
policy experiment.
So let's put this up somewhere

01:00:06.303 --> 01:00:12.307
we can see it.
Let's think about a new tax

01:00:12.307 --> 01:00:14.887
policy.
So suppose that Congress gets

01:00:14.887 --> 01:00:18.258
fed up with all these newspaper
reports about how 2/3 of

01:00:18.258 --> 01:00:22.119
American's don't pay their taxes
or whatever the true proportion

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:23.443
is,
I think it's actually a little

01:00:23.443 --> 01:00:26.799
higher than that but never mind.
They get fed up with all these

01:00:26.799 --> 01:00:29.809
reports and they say,
this isn't fair,

01:00:29.809 --> 01:00:34.770
we should make people pay their
taxes so we're going to change

01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:39.162
the law and instead of
paying--instead of being in jail

01:00:39.162 --> 01:00:43.712
for ten years,
or the equivalent of a fine of

01:00:43.712 --> 01:00:49.301
-10 if you're caught cheating,
we're going to raise the fine

01:00:49.301 --> 01:00:53.469
or the time in jail so that it's
now -20.

01:00:53.469 --> 01:01:01.330
So the policy experiment is
let's raise the fine--to fine

01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:10.032
the cheating--to -20 and the aim
of this policy is try to deter

01:01:10.032 --> 01:01:15.819
cheating, right?
It seems a plausible thing for

01:01:15.819 --> 01:01:23.427
a government to want to do.
Let's redraw the matrix,

01:01:23.427 --> 01:01:31.271
so here's the game - 2,0,
4, -20,4, 0,0,

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:41.530
4 audit, not audit and pay
honestly or cheating.

01:01:41.530 --> 01:01:44.770
So here's our new payoffs and
let's ask the question,

01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:48.467
with this new fine in place,
now we've raised the fine,

01:01:48.467 --> 01:01:52.543
to being caught not paying your
taxes, in the long run once

01:01:52.543 --> 01:01:56.760
things have worked their way
back into equilibrium again,

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:01.095
after a few years,
do we expect American taxpaying

01:02:01.095 --> 01:02:04.280
compliance to go up or to go
down,

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:07.701
or what do we expect?
What do we think is going to

01:02:07.701 --> 01:02:10.729
happen?
So who thinks it's going to go

01:02:10.729 --> 01:02:13.055
up?
Who thinks it's going to go

01:02:13.055 --> 01:02:15.427
down?
Who thinks it's going to say

01:02:15.427 --> 01:02:17.679
the same?
Who's abstaining here?

01:02:17.679 --> 01:02:18.860
I notice the parents are
abstaining.

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.080
u're not really meant to
abstain.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:23.814
You have to vote here.
Well how are we going to figure

01:02:23.814 --> 01:02:25.792
this out?
How are we going to figure out

01:02:25.792 --> 01:02:27.810
what's going to happen to
compliance?

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:39.869
What happens to tax compliance?
Tax compliance,

01:02:39.869 --> 01:02:45.061
remember that was our P--no it
wasn't, sorry,

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:49.227
it was our Q.
The only way we're going to

01:02:49.227 --> 01:02:54.374
figure this out is to work out,
so let's work out the new Q in

01:02:54.374 --> 01:02:56.370
equilibrium.
Let's do this,

01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:59.029
so to find out the new Q in
equilibrium, once again,

01:02:59.029 --> 01:03:01.949
we're going to have to look at
the auditor's payoffs,

01:03:01.949 --> 01:03:08.362
and the auditor's payoffs if
they audit, they're going to get

01:03:08.362 --> 01:03:14.660
2Q plus 4(1-Q),
and if they don't audit they're

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:21.742
going to get 4Q plus 0(1-Q),
and if the auditor is

01:03:21.742 --> 01:03:24.962
indifferent,
if they're mixing,

01:03:24.962 --> 01:03:27.769
it must still be the case that
these are equal.

01:03:27.769 --> 01:03:31.052
And now I want to ask you a
question, where have you seen

01:03:31.052 --> 01:03:33.826
that equation before?
Yeah, it's still there right,

01:03:33.826 --> 01:03:38.165
I didn't delete it.
It's the same equation that

01:03:38.165 --> 01:03:41.909
sits up there.
Is that right?

01:03:41.909 --> 01:03:45.874
From the auditor's point of
view, given the payoffs to the

01:03:45.874 --> 01:03:50.257
auditors nothing has changed,
so the tax compliance rate that

01:03:50.257 --> 01:03:54.065
makes the auditor exactly
indifferent between auditing

01:03:54.065 --> 01:03:57.369
your parents and not auditing
your parents,

01:03:57.369 --> 01:04:03.570
is still exactly the same as it
was before at 2/3.

01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:09.456
In equilibrium,
tax compliance hasn't changed

01:04:09.456 --> 01:04:12.751
at all.
Let me say that again,

01:04:12.751 --> 01:04:17.978
the policy was we're going to
double the fines for being

01:04:17.978 --> 01:04:22.921
caught cheating and in
equilibrium it made absolutely

01:04:22.921 --> 01:04:29.480
no difference whatsoever to the
equilibrium tax compliance rate.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.949
Now why did it make no
difference?

01:04:32.949 --> 01:04:35.465
Well let's have a techie answer
and then a better,

01:04:35.465 --> 01:04:39.337
a more intuitive answer.
The techie answer is this,

01:04:39.337 --> 01:04:44.315
what determines the equilibrium
tax compliance rate,

01:04:44.315 --> 01:04:50.073
what determines the equilibrium
mix for the column player is

01:04:50.073 --> 01:04:55.230
what?
Is the row's payoffs.

01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:58.806
What determines the equilibrium
mix for the column player are

01:04:58.806 --> 01:05:01.309
the row's payoffs--row player's
payoffs.

01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:05.104
We didn't change the row
player's payoffs,

01:05:05.104 --> 01:05:10.194
so we're not going to change
the equilibrium mix for the

01:05:10.194 --> 01:05:13.814
column player.
Say again, we changed one of

01:05:13.814 --> 01:05:17.722
the payoffs for the column
player but the column player's

01:05:17.722 --> 01:05:21.699
equilibrium mix depends on the
row player's payoffs and we

01:05:21.699 --> 01:05:24.909
haven't changed the row player's
payoffs,

01:05:24.909 --> 01:05:28.963
so we won't change the
equilibrium compliance rate,

01:05:28.963 --> 01:05:32.450
the equilibrium mix by the
column player.

01:05:32.450 --> 01:05:37.675
What will have changed here?
What will have changed in the

01:05:37.675 --> 01:05:40.074
new equilibrium?
So we've pretty much

01:05:40.074 --> 01:05:42.664
established that people are
cheating as much as they were

01:05:42.664 --> 01:05:45.320
before in equilibrium.
Rahul, can I get Henry here?

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.050
Student: Probability has
changed.

01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:47.590
Professor Ben Polak: Say
again.

01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:48.949
Student: The probability
of audit would have changed.

01:05:48.949 --> 01:05:50.384
Professor Ben Polak: The
probability of audit will have

01:05:50.384 --> 01:05:52.640
changed.
What's going to change is not

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:55.566
the Q but the P,
the probability with which

01:05:55.566 --> 01:05:59.119
you're audited is going to
change in this model.

01:05:59.119 --> 01:06:02.401
Let's just check it,
to find the new P,

01:06:02.401 --> 01:06:06.460
I need to look at the
taxpayer's payoffs and the

01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:10.962
taxpayer's payoffs are now 0,
–sorry,

01:06:10.962 --> 01:06:17.062
if they pay their taxes
honestly then they get 0,

01:06:17.062 --> 01:06:24.561
and if they cheat they get -20
with probability P and 4 with

01:06:24.561 --> 01:06:27.986
probability 1-P.
If they're mixing,

01:06:27.986 --> 01:06:30.129
if some of them are paying and
some of them are not,

01:06:30.129 --> 01:06:35.664
this must be the same,
and I'm being more careful than

01:06:35.664 --> 01:06:43.331
I was last time I hope,
this gives me 24 P is equal to

01:06:43.331 --> 01:06:50.916
4 or P equals 1/6.
So the audit rate has gone down

01:06:50.916 --> 01:06:54.864
from 2/7 to 1/6.
I'm guessing that probably

01:06:54.864 --> 01:06:58.222
wasn't the goal of the policy
although it isn't necessarily a

01:06:58.222 --> 01:07:00.276
bad thing.
There is some benefit for

01:07:00.276 --> 01:07:02.345
society here,
because audits are costly,

01:07:02.345 --> 01:07:05.210
both to do for the auditor and
they're unpleasant to be

01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:08.348
audited,
so the fact that we've managed

01:07:08.348 --> 01:07:13.000
to lower the audit rate from 2/7
to 1/6 is a good thing,

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:22.820
but we didn't manage to raise
the compliance rate.

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:25.556
So I don't want to take this
model too literally,

01:07:25.556 --> 01:07:28.657
because it's just a toy model,
but nevertheless,

01:07:28.657 --> 01:07:32.639
let's try and draw out some
lessons from this model.

01:07:32.639 --> 01:07:37.364
So here what we did was we
changed the payoff to cheating,

01:07:37.364 --> 01:07:41.149
we made it worse.
But a different kind of change

01:07:41.149 --> 01:07:45.127
is we could have changed,
sorry,- we changed the payoff

01:07:45.127 --> 01:07:48.000
negatively to being caught
cheating.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.622
But a different change we could
have done is we could have left

01:07:51.622 --> 01:07:54.776
the -10 in place and we could
have raised the payoff to

01:07:54.776 --> 01:07:59.348
cheating and not getting caught.
We could have left this 10 in

01:07:59.348 --> 01:08:03.690
place and changed this 4 let's
say to a 6 or an 8.

01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:08.019
We've increased the benefits to
cheating if you're not caught.

01:08:08.019 --> 01:08:13.230
What would that have done in
equilibrium?

01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:16.916
So I claim, once again,
that would have done nothing in

01:08:16.916 --> 01:08:21.149
equilibrium to the probability
of people paying their taxes,

01:08:21.149 --> 01:08:25.149
but that would have done what
to the audit rate?

01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:28.142
The audit rate would have gone
up, the equilibrium audit rate

01:08:28.142 --> 01:08:31.390
would have gone up.
Let's tell that story a second.

01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:33.928
So rich people,
people who are well paid,

01:08:33.928 --> 01:08:37.800
have a little bit more to gain
from cheating on their taxes if

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:41.310
they're not caught,
there's more money at stake.

01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:44.095
So my colleagues who are
finance professors in the

01:08:44.095 --> 01:08:47.789
business school have more money
on their tax returns than I do,

01:08:47.789 --> 01:08:52.170
so in principle,
they gain more if they cheat.

01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:56.909
Does that mean that they cheat
more than me in equilibrium?

01:08:56.909 --> 01:08:58.425
No, it doesn't mean that they
cheat more than me in

01:08:58.425 --> 01:09:01.319
equilibrium.
What does it mean?

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:04.909
It means they get audited more
often.

01:09:04.909 --> 01:09:07.482
In equilibrium,
richer people aren't

01:09:07.482 --> 01:09:11.671
necessarily going to cheat more,
but they are going to get

01:09:11.671 --> 01:09:14.170
audited more,
and that's true.

01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:17.617
The federal audit rates are
designed so they audit the rich

01:09:17.617 --> 01:09:20.738
more than they audit the poor.
Again, it's not because they

01:09:20.738 --> 01:09:23.218
think the rich are inherently
less honest, or the poor are

01:09:23.218 --> 01:09:25.279
inherently more honest,
or anything like that,

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:27.814
it's simply that the gains to
cheating and not getting caught

01:09:27.814 --> 01:09:32.039
are bigger if you're rich,
so you need to audit more to

01:09:32.039 --> 01:09:37.525
push back into equilibrium.
Now, suppose we did in fact

01:09:37.525 --> 01:09:42.312
want to use the policy of
raising fines to push down,

01:09:42.312 --> 01:09:47.560
to push up the compliance rate,
to push down cheating.

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:52.317
How would we change the law?
Suppose we want to raise the

01:09:52.317 --> 01:09:55.192
fines for cheating,
we don't like people cheating

01:09:55.192 --> 01:09:58.447
so we raise the fines,
but we're worried about this

01:09:58.447 --> 01:10:01.145
result that didn't push up
compliance rates,

01:10:01.145 --> 01:10:04.784
how could we change the law or
change the incentives in the

01:10:04.784 --> 01:10:08.550
game so that it actually would
change compliance rates?

01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:14.090
What could we do?
Yeah.

01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:19.350
Student: If we changed
the payoffs of auditing to 4,

01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:22.390
from 2 to 4.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:26.063
Good, if we want to change the
compliance rates we should

01:10:26.063 --> 01:10:28.489
change the payoffs to the
auditor.

01:10:28.489 --> 01:10:32.821
The problem with the way the
auditor is paid here is that the

01:10:32.821 --> 01:10:36.503
auditor is paid more if they
manage to catch people,

01:10:36.503 --> 01:10:39.581
but audits are costly.
The problem with that is when

01:10:39.581 --> 01:10:42.066
you raise the fine on the other
side, all that happens is the

01:10:42.066 --> 01:10:43.930
auditor's audit less often in
equilibrium.

01:10:43.930 --> 01:10:46.488
So if you want to get a higher
compliance rate,

01:10:46.488 --> 01:10:49.269
one thing you could do is
change the payoffs to the

01:10:49.269 --> 01:10:52.050
auditor to make auditing less
costly for them,

01:10:52.050 --> 01:10:56.069
or making catching people nicer
for them, give them a reward,

01:10:56.069 --> 01:11:00.090
or you could simply take it out
of Game Theory altogether.

01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:03.232
You could enforce,
you could have congressional

01:11:03.232 --> 01:11:06.989
law that sets the audit rates
outside of equilibrium,

01:11:06.989 --> 01:11:09.804
and that's been much discussed
in Congress over the last five

01:11:09.804 --> 01:11:11.550
years.
Somebody setting audit rates,

01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:13.300
as it were, exogenously by
Congress.

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:15.199
Why might that not be a great
idea?

01:11:15.199 --> 01:11:17.908
Leaving aside Economic Theory
for a second,

01:11:17.908 --> 01:11:21.326
leaving aside Game Theory,
why might it not be a great

01:11:21.326 --> 01:11:25.001
idea to have Congress set the
audit rates rather than some

01:11:25.001 --> 01:11:27.154
office?
Student: Most members in

01:11:27.154 --> 01:11:29.824
Congress have a lot of money so
they're going to lower the audit

01:11:29.824 --> 01:11:31.520
rates so that they don't get
audited.

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.454
Professor Ben Polak: So
the lady in the front is saying

01:11:33.454 --> 01:11:34.850
that a lot of Congressmen are
rather rich,

01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:36.329
so maybe they have particular
incentives here.

01:11:36.329 --> 01:11:39.205
I don't want to take a
particular political stance

01:11:39.205 --> 01:11:42.726
here, but it could be whatever
side of the political spectrum

01:11:42.726 --> 01:11:45.676
you guys sit on,
it could be that you might not

01:11:45.676 --> 01:11:47.689
trust Congress to get this
right.

01:11:47.689 --> 01:11:50.951
You might think they're going
to be political considerations

01:11:50.951 --> 01:11:54.212
going on in Congress other than
just having an efficient tax

01:11:54.212 --> 01:11:56.846
system.
Okay, so what do I want to draw

01:11:56.846 --> 01:12:00.082
out as lessons here?
The big lessons from this class

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:02.965
are there are three different
ways to think about

01:12:02.965 --> 01:12:06.210
randomization in equilibrium or
out of equilibrium.

01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:08.099
One is it's genuinely
randomization,

01:12:08.099 --> 01:12:10.528
another is it could be
something about peoples

01:12:10.528 --> 01:12:12.920
belief's,
and a third way and a very

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:16.692
important way is it could be
telling us something about the

01:12:16.692 --> 01:12:20.529
proportion of people who are
doing something in society,

01:12:20.529 --> 01:12:26.479
in this case the proportion of
people who are paying tax.

01:12:26.479 --> 01:12:29.605
A second important lesson I
want to draw out here,

01:12:29.605 --> 01:12:33.572
beyond just finding equilibria,
two other things we drew out

01:12:33.572 --> 01:12:37.229
today, one lesson was when
you're checking equilibria,

01:12:37.229 --> 01:12:41.089
checking mixed strategy
equilibria, you only have to

01:12:41.089 --> 01:12:43.890
check for pure strategy
deviations.

01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:47.023
Be careful, you have to check
for all possible pure strategy

01:12:47.023 --> 01:12:50.262
deviations, not just the pure
strategies that were involved in

01:12:50.262 --> 01:12:52.888
the mix.
If the guy has seven strategies

01:12:52.888 --> 01:12:56.415
and is only mixing on two,
you have to remember to check

01:12:56.415 --> 01:12:59.100
the other five.
The third lesson I want to draw

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:01.569
out today is because of the way
equilibria works,

01:13:01.569 --> 01:13:06.717
mixed strategy equilibria work,
if I change the column player's

01:13:06.717 --> 01:13:11.199
payoffs it changes the row
player's equilibrium mix,

01:13:11.199 --> 01:13:14.215
and if I change the row
player's payoffs,

01:13:14.215 --> 01:13:17.909
it changes the column player's
equilibrium mix.

01:13:17.909 --> 01:13:20.939
Next time, we're going to pick
up this idea that mixed

01:13:20.939 --> 01:13:23.912
strategies can be about
proportions of people playing

01:13:23.912 --> 01:13:27.000
things and take it to a totally
different setting,

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.432
namely evolution.
So on Wednesday we'll start

01:13:30.432 --> 01:13:32.098
talking about evolution.

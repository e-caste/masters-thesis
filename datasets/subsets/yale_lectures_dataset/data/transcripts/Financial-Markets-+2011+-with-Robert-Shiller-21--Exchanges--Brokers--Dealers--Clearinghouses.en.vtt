00:00:00.932 --> 00:00:02.740
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: Well,
today I wanted to talk

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.980
about exchanges and
clearinghouses, primarily

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.230
stock exchanges.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.170
So, these are places,
where shares in

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.060
corporations are traded.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.190
And I think, it's good to devote
a whole session to

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.720
them, because exchange is
central to economics.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.130
In fact, I was struck
recently.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.510
I was re-reading the
presidential

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.030
address of my old teacher.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.310
When I was an undergraduate at
University of Michigan, I took

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.334
a course by Professor
Kenneth Boulding.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.700
I suppose, I'm influenced
by him.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.160
When he was elected president
of the American Economic

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.360
Association, he gave a
talk about economics.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.880
And he had an interesting
definition of economics.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.570
What is economics?

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.120
There's a lot of definitions
given for the field, but one

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.370
definition is the theory of the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.210
allocation of scarce resources.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.030
That's, by some definition,
what the essence

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.410
of economics is.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.670
But Boulding said, that doesn't
sound right to him,

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.000
because political science is
about the allocation of scarce

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.340
resources, and so is --

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.430
even the family is an

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.810
instrument of scarce resources.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.900
So, Boulding said in --

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.280
it was his 1969 presidential
address --

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.390
that economics is the
study of exchange.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.880
Obviously, it's prices and
quantities that economics

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.500
emphasizes, and those are
parameters of an exchange.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.760
So let's say, that
equals economics.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.160
I'm reminded of another book.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.180
I'm talking in very general
terms first, and then I'm

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.990
going to focus in on
stock exchanges.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.940
But I'm reminded of another
really important book, which I

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:33.930
read so many years ago, by Karl
Polanyi called The Great

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.180
Transformation.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.890
And that was written in 1944.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.400
What is the great
transformation?

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.860
Well, for Polanyi, it's the
invention of exchange.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.350
He said, what is the most
important invention of man?

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.490
Maybe, it's exchange.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:09.610
According to his history of
humankind, this was a

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.280
relatively recent invention,
Neolithic or

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.020
more recent than that.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:22.110
He argues that in primitive
societies, there is really no

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.980
arm's length exchange.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.160
An arm's length exchange is one,
where you just quote a

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.180
price and a quantity, and you
don't have any other business.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.340
The price and the quantity
sum it up.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.630
It's a business transaction.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.400
But Polanyi argued, that until
just something on the order of

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.150
10,000 years ago, there were
no business transactions.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.150
There was only gift exchange.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.730
There were relationships
people had.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.610
And you would solidify a
relationship by making a gift

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.089
to someone else, and then
that person would later

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:06.060
reciprocate, but there's no
price, there's no exchange.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.250
So, he claims that the
development of our

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.280
civilization is really the
result of the development of

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.950
the idea of exchange, and then,
an amplification of the

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.980
idea as it became more
and more pervasive.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.760
By the way, I've since
learned --

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.830
I thought Polanyi was
very impressive --

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.000
but some anthropologists
question, whether there wasn't

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.510
exchange more than
10,000 years ago.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.290
And they cite evidence.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.790
One kind of evidence that's
found of this is, that certain

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.330
commodities, even in the
Paleolithic times, certain

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.530
commodities are found far from
where they were mined.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.410
Like flint to make stone
tools, or ochre

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.010
to make body paint.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.875
And they figured out where --
you can do a chemical analysis

00:04:56.875 --> 00:04:59.910
and you can figure out
where it was mined.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.240
And then, if you find that it
arrived somewhere 1,000 miles

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.740
away, there must have been
exchange, right?

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.590
The cave --

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.444
no?

00:05:09.444 --> 00:05:11.764
STUDENT: Couldn't they have
just killed someone?

00:05:11.764 --> 00:05:12.640
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: OK.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.390
It could have been, that they
just killed someone, right.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.000
So, I guess nobody knows.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.020
But anyway, some anthropologists
argue that

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.500
there was exchange.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.340
Maybe, it was too pervasive.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.720
Of course, people did kill a lot
of people in those days,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.970
too, anthropologists report.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.300
So, maybe Polanyi had
it exactly right.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.940
But I think, he had it at least
approximately right,

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.470
that exchange has become a
bigger and bigger part of our

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.860
lives, and that's modern
civilization.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:56.670
I'm going to talk mostly about
financial exchange.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.570
That's the subject
of this course.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.670
But I can be a little
bit more general.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.420
I wanted to start by
distinguishing a

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.500
broker and a dealer.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.225
What's the difference?

00:06:14.225 --> 00:06:16.510
It's a fundamental thing.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.760
A broker --

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.880
actually, I've got this
almost as a slogan --

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:31.470
a broker acts on behalf of
others as an agent to earn a

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.650
commission.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:40.970
So, it's for others, trades for
others as an agent for a

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:41.776
commission.

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:43.155
A commission is a fee.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.200
What is a dealer?

00:06:51.200 --> 00:07:00.980
A dealer trades for himself
or herself, acting as a

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:09.700
principal, not an agent, and
profits from a markup.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.910
So, I can give you an
example of each.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:23.060
When you buy or sell a house,
do you get a real estate

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.910
broker or a real
estate dealer?

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.140
That's almost obvious, right?

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.440
Because you heard the
term real estate

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.310
broker so many times.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:37.160
When you buy or sell a house,
you commission a broker, and

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.110
you agree on a contract that
pays the real estate broker a

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.700
certain sum of money --
maybe 6% of the value

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.350
of the house --

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:50.470
if a buyer is found.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.400
And then, the broker doesn't
buy your house, right?

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.550
So, the broker is an agent.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:01.790
And the 6% is the commission
that the broker gets, if he or

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:10.240
she is successful in finding
the other side of the deal.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.500
What's an example of a dealer?

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.280
An antique dealer.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.460
Suppose, you're buying a chest
of drawers for your apartment.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.220
You go to an antique store, and
there's someone there --

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.470
your antique dealer --

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:37.000
who has furniture, that he now
owns, having bought it, and

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.790
makes a profit by selling it
to you at a higher price,

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.300
namely with a markup.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:47.050
He marks up the price that
he paid for the item.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:51.550
But let me just ask you,
why is it that way?

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.750
Why are antiques sold
by dealers and

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.000
real estate by brokers?

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.000
I recently had a discussion with
Guillermo Ordonez, who is

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.470
an assistant professor here, and
we were wondering, maybe

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.110
there are real estate dealers.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.940
Oliver helped us and found,
actually, in Germany, a couple

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.230
of real estate dealers.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:23.330
But only like a couple, and we
couldn't find any in the U.S.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.445
And we had searched around in
many other countries, and

00:09:26.445 --> 00:09:30.590
there was just virtually none,
no real estate dealers.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.990
Anyone have any idea why?

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.300
I'm asking you to think.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.830
It's a little --

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.740
or does anyone come from a
country, where they have real

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.540
estate dealers?

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.700
And that would end
it, if you --

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.230
I bet not, right?

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.930
Well, what about antique
brokers?

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:47.670
Why not that?

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.170
Have you ever heard of
an antique broker?

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.500
Maybe, there are.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.290
But it's an interesting
question.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:59.430
It seems like some markets are
naturally dealer markets, and

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.660
some are broker markets.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:06.480
We thought of one explanation,
why there aren't real estate

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.940
dealers, at least in
the United States.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:15.490
We learned that a dealer has
to pay income tax on the

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:20.150
profits from a deal, and that
is at a higher rate than a

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:25.400
capital gains tax, and so
that closes people out.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.070
You wouldn't want to be a real
estate dealer, because you'd

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:32.820
end up paying a higher tax.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.710
The other thing is, I wonder
if there's something about

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:42.530
information, that someone who
deals in real estate --

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:46.180
it's just too hard to know
what to pay for a house.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.260
It's just so subjective.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.540
You can make big mistakes, if
you're going to buy houses,

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.100
and then resell them at a
markup, because the market is

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:59.140
just so variable, and it
ultimately changes quickly.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.860
Maybe it's too risky.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.490
I don't know.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:02.650
I'm trying to think.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:04.440
But of course, there are
real estate dealers,

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.690
it's just very rare.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.640
So, we're going to talk
about stock markets.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.930
Which do you think stock
markets are?

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:17.640
Are they dealer markets
or broker markets?

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.050
Well, the answer is both.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:25.130
And now it's not as clear, and
I'll come back to this.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:38.030
The New York Stock Exchange, New
York Stock Exchange in New

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:42.570
York is a broker market.

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.911
Or they would say, an
auction market.

00:11:45.911 --> 00:11:49.880
It's a continuous double auction
market, where a broker

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.320
facilitates the trades.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:59.840
The NASDAQ market is
a dealer market.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.180
So, you pay commissions to your
broker at the New York

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.500
Stock Exchange, you pay
a markup to your

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.720
dealer at the NASDAQ.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:24.170
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.130
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: I
thought I will start by

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:32.490
talking about stock exchanges,
and historically --

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:37.680
And I have a lot to say.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.910
I can't cover it all --

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.890
I was going to start with
ancient Rome --

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.870
I think I mentioned
that before.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.020
But the --

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.380
I'm getting there
in my notes --

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:52.420
the ancient Roman stock exchange
is the first stock

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.250
exchange, that, I think,
anyone knows about.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.820
But traders --

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:10.710
I'm relying on the research of
Ulrike Malmendier, who has

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.270
studied the ancient Roman
stock exchanges

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.380
much as can be studied.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.030
There's not that much
evidence about it.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:25.610
But the traders met outdoors
on the Roman Forum at the

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.050
Temple of Castor.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:35.000
That's where you went to
buy and sell shares.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.595
The shares in Latin were
called partes --

00:13:37.595 --> 00:13:40.050
I don't know if I covered
this or not --

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.300
and the companies were
called publicani.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:51.550
The peculiar nature of the
ancient Roman corporations is

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:55.050
that they sold -- their
customers were the government.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.650
And so, they did services for
the government, like provide

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:02.250
horses for the army, or they
would feed the geese on the

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.560
Roman forum, on the
Roman capital.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.210
They always fed the geese there,
because the geese were

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:11.940
hallowed in Ancient Rome,
because they once warned of an

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.170
invasion by cackling.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:17.760
So, there was a publicanus
that was in charge

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.010
of feeding the geese.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:26.395
And also, they would talk
about share prices.

00:14:26.395 --> 00:14:29.350
It's known, that they would go
up and down, even then, but

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.710
there's no data on their
share prices.

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:37.340
It seemed, that there was a long
gap for stock exchanges

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:41.920
after the fall of the Roman
Empire, and the publicani

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.750
disappeared.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:49.800
And there was a wide variety
of financial arrangements,

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.350
some of them resembling
corporations.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:58.320
But the advent of the rebirth
of the stock exchange didn't

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:05.080
occur until 1602 in Amsterdam,
when the --

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.360
I mentioned this before --

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:11.600
when the Dutch East India
Company started trading.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:18.970
And then, Jonathan's
Coffee House --

00:15:22.127 --> 00:15:23.630
I like that story --

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.510
in London.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:31.930
Lots of people would get
together and talk there, and

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:38.675
coffee houses became a big
thing in the late 1600s.

00:15:38.675 --> 00:15:43.250
And somebody started posting
stock prices on the wall at

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.790
Jonathan's Coffee House by --

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.140
what was the date --

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.470
1698.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.220
And so, the London Stock
Exchange grew out of

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.420
Jonathan's Coffee House.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:59.090
And then, moving forward in
time, now we're going to get

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:00.610
lots of countries, but
I'll mention the

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:01.860
New York Stock Exchange.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:14.790
The traders of shares in the
United States met outside, in

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:20.090
1792, under a buttonwood tree.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:21.470
I'll put buttonwood.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:22.630
That's a curious name.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:28.000
I think that's just
a common tree that

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.570
we still have around.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.380
And they signed the agreement
to form the

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.630
New York Stock Exchange.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:42.130
What else?

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:43.900
Next, in my little history.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.609
India.

00:16:46.609 --> 00:16:52.510
By the 1850s, there
were in Mumbai --

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.800
or then called Bombay --

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:00.990
there were traders under
a famous banyan tree.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:03.880
They were all outdoors.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.599
In Bombay.

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:08.270
Banyan trees are
more impressive

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.450
than buttonwood trees.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:20.510
But it was by 1875, the Bombay
Stock Exchange was founded.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:21.760
So, that's the BFC.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.400
So, that's been around
for over 100 years.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.760
But things have happened
more recently.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.340
One thing that's been shaking
things up -- these are very

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.750
venerable old institutions --

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:38.060
what's been shaking things
up is the advent

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.400
of electronic trading.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.830
And these were kind of
old-fashioned, venerable

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:46.480
institutions.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.710
Do you know what happens at the
New York Stock Exchange,

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:51.470
what happened then and
still happens today?

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:55.100
There's a floor called the
trading floor, and the various

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:59.460
brokers meet there, just like
in Jonathan's Coffee House.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.730
They actually physically come
to the floor and they stand

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:07.440
around, and there are posts
for each stock.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.080
And if today you think, you have
a customer who wants to

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.740
buy IBM stock, then you go over
to the IBM crowd, and

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.680
there's a crowd of brokers
there who are trading.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.820
And you just do it, verbally.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:25.170
You talk to them and
you make a trade.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.880
That's really old-fashioned.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.910
There is something more
electronic and more modern

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.340
about the New York Stock
Exchange, but that specialist

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.570
post behavior still persists.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.950
Most of the world is switching
over to electronic trading,

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.170
and so things happen that --

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.890
so, for example, in India they
developed another stock

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:48.850
exchange called the National
Stock Exchange,

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:54.430
and that was in 1992.

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:58.720
And the National Stock Exchange
was all-electronic,

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.385
and so it was the
modern version.

00:19:00.385 --> 00:19:03.650
It's rapidly gaining on the
Bombay Stock Exchange.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:11.190
So, let me go a little
bit more forward.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:14.840
China, because of the communist
government, did not

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.810
have a stock exchange
until 1990.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:22.150
And there were two stock
exchanges founded in

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.710
China in 1990 --

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:29.570
Shanghai, Shenzhen.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.850
And at least the Shanghai Stock
Exchange is owned by the

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:39.496
Chinese government, and that's
why Laura Cha, when she talked

00:19:39.496 --> 00:19:41.090
to us about that --

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:44.000
she was on the China Securities
Regulatory

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.960
Commission, which actually
owned the

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.210
Shanghai Stock Exchange.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.250
Oh, Latin America.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:05.350
Sao Paolo Stock Exchange,
1890.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.940
Mexico has only one stock
exchange, but it

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.550
was founded in 1894.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.180
So, we seem to have like two
different kinds of exchanges.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.210
We have the old exchanges, which
are at least 100 years

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.620
old, and we have the new
electronic exchanges.

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.200
Things have really sped
up with the advent

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.110
of electronic exchanges.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:30.250
So, I mentioned the New York
Stock Exchange, which started

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:36.380
on the street outdoors and is an
old-fashioned exchange that

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.850
has been slow to update.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:42.810
But more recently, we have --

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.660
I mentioned it already --

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:45.910
NASDAQ.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.670
It stands for, originally,
National Association of

00:20:55.670 --> 00:21:01.530
Securities Dealers Automatic
Quotation System, which was

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:05.876
created in the 1970s.

00:21:05.876 --> 00:21:09.840
It's an interesting story
about NASDAQ.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.390
In the '70s, the New York Stock
Exchange with highly

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:14.160
prestigious.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.990
It was the big board,
the place.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:23.340
And a critical element of as
stock exchange is, that, in

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.360
order to get your stocks traded
on the exchange, you

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.590
have to satisfy listing
requirements.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.260
So, the New York Stock Exchange
would examine any

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:36.440
corporation that wanted to be
listed on the exchange, and it

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.260
was the prestigious,
big exchange,

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.400
so it had high standards.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:45.420
So, the company had to have a
history of earnings, it had to

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.560
have the right kind
of management

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.430
structure and board.

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:54.940
A lot of things were checked out
by the exchange, and as a

00:21:54.940 --> 00:22:00.190
result, the way it would work
in the 1970s, a startup

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.190
company could never
get traded on the

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:03.880
New York Stock Exchange.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:08.790
It would be traded, instead,
by brokers off-exchange, or

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:14.380
''over-the-counter.'' So, OTC
means ''over-the-counter,"

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.570
that means not on an exchange.

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:27.580
So, in the 1970s and earlier,
the over-the-counter brokers

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.670
would deal with each other,
informally with telephone

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:32.800
calls, or actually out
on the street.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.490
Meet each other out on the
sidewalk originally, and then

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:36.740
they got telephones.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.645
And they had some record,
which they called ''pink

00:22:41.645 --> 00:22:45.440
sheets,'' because they
were traditionally

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.110
printed on pink paper.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:52.690
These were lists of dealers' buy
and sell quotes on prices

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:55.622
of over-the-counter stocks.

00:22:55.622 --> 00:22:59.110
The National Association of
Securities Dealers, then, was

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:02.600
an organization of these
over-the-counter traders.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:07.410
And in the early '70s,
they set up the first

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.650
computerized system.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:13.640
They decided that everyone's
telephoning everybody --

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:25.030
let's create a system that
really works and that gets us

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.280
the information.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:33.960
And so, that was the NASDAQ
system, the first computer

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:38.230
based system, which has now
increasingly taken over much

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:39.330
of the world.

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.060
I shouldn't imply that the New
York Stock Exchange was

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.760
entirely a laggard on this.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.800
Electronics played a role in
stocks going back very early.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:53.330
The New York Stock Exchange
used telegraph in the 19th

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:55.690
century to convey
prices, and they

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:57.980
invented ticker tape machines.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.460
A ticker tape machine is an
electronic printer that would

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:05.090
print out stock prices.

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:07.630
And in fact, Thomas Edison,
the inventor, his first

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:10.960
invention was actually a
ticker tape machine.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.630
That was in, I think,
the 1870s.

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.890
It printed stock prices.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:18.490
But all it was, was a record of
what had traded recently.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:23.630
It wasn't a system that
helped you trade.

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:27.170
You just reported what had
happened, it was historical.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:32.210
So, I wanted to show you, what
NASDAQ created in the '70s,

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:38.600
and it's an order book, that
would be visible to everyone

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.850
who trades on it.

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:52.060
Prior to discussing that,
I want to tell you about

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:56.990
different kinds of orders.

00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:01.520
If you buy and sell stock, and
you call up a broker and you

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.020
say, I want to buy and sell, the
simplest kind of order is

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:14.380
a ''market order.'' And you
would specify the quantity.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.130
You would say, I
want to buy --

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:17.400
and the name of the company,
of course --

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:21.010
I want to buy 100 shares of
General Motors, or I want to

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.720
sell 100 shares.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.010
But you don't name a price.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.525
You'll find out, whatever
the price was.

00:25:28.525 --> 00:25:33.320
The broker will get you
the best price --

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.980
if he or she is a good broker,
will try to get you the best

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:41.330
price, but it'll still be
unknown to you, because you

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:42.920
didn't specify it.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.000
You might be unhappy
with the price.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.100
The price might be too
high [addition: if

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.350
you want to buy shares].

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.840
And then, the broker will say
to you, well, if you're

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.320
unhappy, you should've
told me.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.810
You could have told me not to
pay more than a certain amount

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:58.080
for a buy, or not to take
less than a certain

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.040
amount for a sell.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:07.370
So, the alternative is a ''limit
order.'' And so, with

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:11.780
a limit order you give both
quantity and price.

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:19.430
So, if it's a buy, I want to buy
so many shares but I don't

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.400
want to pay more than such
and such a price.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.660
Then, the broker will keep
that on his or her

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.340
books, until --

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:33.060
well, whatever the agreement
between you and broker is.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:36.490
It might expire after the day
is over, or you could ask to

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:38.970
have it kept on the book.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:45.640
And when the price becomes
available, which is no higher

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.820
than your specified
price, then the

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.390
order will be executed.

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:51.810
Otherwise, it won't
be executed.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.120
And then, for a sell order, it
would be the same thing.

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.980
You specify both the quantity
and a price, and the order

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.580
will be filled or
partly filled.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.700
They might not be able to get
all of your quantity, but

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.580
they'll fill as much as
they can of it at

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:07.830
that price or lower.

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.600
And there's another kind of
order, called a ''stop

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:24.420
order.'' With a stop order, you
also specify quantity and

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:28.240
price, but it's different.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:36.480
With a limit order, say it's a
buy limit order -- well, let's

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.800
talk about sell.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.810
If it's a sell limit order, you
would sell the quantity at

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:45.270
such and such a price
or higher.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:49.600
With a stop order, you would
sell that quantity at such and

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.090
such a price or lower.

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:52.470
Let's make that clear.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:56.570
A stop order, also called a
''stop loss order,'' is an

00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:02.240
order that you can place with a
broker to indicate, that I'm

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.240
worried that this stock
might really collapse.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.660
I'm holding it, but I want you
to sell it, if the price

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.440
starts falling a lot.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.720
So, suppose the price
is $100 today --

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.480
I could put in a stop loss order
at $80, and then, at

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.720
least I know I can't lose more
than 20% of my investment,

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.090
because the broker will
immediately sell it, when the

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:27.940
price of that stock
falls below $80.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.830
There's also a buy stop order,
and that would be something

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:34.350
that someone would rationally
do, if that person

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:36.110
had shorted a stock.

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:39.380
So, if you had shorted a stock,
and you were worried

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.770
that the price would go up and
ruin you, you can leave with

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:47.160
your broker a buy stop
order to sell it --

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.700
I mean, to buy the stock,
whenever the price exceeds a

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.590
certain amount.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:52.900
And you would do that to prevent
yourself from having

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:56.670
unlimited losses on your
short position.

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:58.510
There's other kinds of orders,
but those are the

00:28:58.510 --> 00:28:59.910
main kinds of orders.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:06.220
Now, I wanted talk specifically
about limit

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.750
orders -- that's the most
important kind.

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:12.310
A lot of advisors say, never
place a market order.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.430
Why should you ever
do a market order?

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:17.180
There's always some price that
you'd be unhappy with.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.140
You might as well say that.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.100
And so, some exchanges don't
even allow market orders.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.420
So, let's talk about
limit orders.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:36.640
And what I wanted to show you
was, what a NASDAQ level II

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.890
customer sees.

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:43.310
NASDAQ is an organization --

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:47.360
now it's a firm traded on its
own stock exchange, it's

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.620
called NASDAQ OMX --

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.330
but if you want to subscribe
to NASDAQ, it's very

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:54.220
expensive, I understand.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:30:00.100
So, you can subscribe at
level I or level II,

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.320
which is more expensive.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.180
I was going to show you an
example of what you would see

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:08.860
on your computer screen, if you
subscribe to NASDAQ level

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.580
II, for a particular stock.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:15.330
So, this is a hypothetical
limit

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:18.530
order book for Microsoft.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:24.160
What it shows --

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:31.960
this is not live, but it would
be live on your screen, and

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.570
these numbers would be changing
before your eyes,

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:38.240
flashing back and forth
before your eyes.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:42.000
And so, I've just frozen
it at a moment in time.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.190
So, what do we have?

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:46.140
We have six columns here.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:50.210
This first column is
the shares that

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:52.110
people want to buy.

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:55.010
So, the first three columns
correspond to those.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:59.050
So, ''bid'' is the price
there, bidding

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:02.200
to buy these shares.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.820
Remember, NASDAQ is
a dealer market.

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:08.120
So, these dealers are making
these bids, or people are

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:12.770
making them through a dealer,
and MPID is the marketplace

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:19.860
ID, where these bids and
offers are being made.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:27.300
So, the first one shown, someone
is offering to buy 100

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:33.670
shares of Microsoft at a price
of $25.23, and that

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:36.730
is listed on ARCX.

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:38.840
ARCX, there's an
interesting --

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.170
I didn't mention
that exchange.

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:41.790
It's now part of the New
York Stock Exchange.

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:46.660
Maybe, I'll come back to that
in a minute, but let me just

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.050
continue to explain
this slide.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:56.000
Now, you note that the bid
prices are arranged in

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.090
declining order.

00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:59.250
They go down as you move down.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:02.030
The computer has sorted
all the orders.

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:03.890
These are all the
unfilled orders.

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:06.990
Someone called their broker and
said, I want to buy 100

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:17.210
shares, and the broker entered
the bid through ARCX, and it's

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:20.430
now on the NASDAQ screen.

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:25.390
Someone else had a much bigger
buy order, wants to buy 9,430

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:30.530
shares, and this came in
directly to NASDAQ, but it's a

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:35.630
penny less, $25.22.

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:37.710
So, you can just see what's
happening, when you go down.

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:38.770
Now, the other side --

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:40.560
is that clear what we're
seeing here?

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.166
The other side of the screen is
the buy [correction: sell]

00:32:42.166 --> 00:32:46.250
orders, and it's exactly the
same, except that here the

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:50.670
numbers go up as you move down
the screen, because the

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:54.490
computer has sorted them
in the reverse order.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:57.930
So, that represents what various
people are willing to

00:32:57.930 --> 00:32:59.530
buy [correction: sell].

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:01.070
So, somebody is willing to
buy [correction: sell]

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:09.370
2,400 shares at $25.24.

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:11.820
Actually, there's two
different customers.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:14.730
This one placed the order first,
so I think that's the

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:17.700
priority, it's by the one who
placed it first. Somebody else

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.280
at the Cincinnati Exchange --

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.560
I guess that's what
that means --

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:26.250
offered to buy 8,200 shares at
the very same price, but it's

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:30.290
listed as a separate
order, and so on.

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:34.400
So, now you're sitting here
looking at the screen now, and

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:40.040
you notice that this ask price
here, it's higher than the bid

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:40.620
price there.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:41.950
So, what does that
mean to you?

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:50.239
It means there's no
trade, right?

00:33:50.239 --> 00:33:57.270
Because someone is offering to
sell at $25.24, and somebody's

00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:00.800
offering to buy at $25.23.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.880
It's no trade, until somebody
changes their price.

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:08.320
That's no surprise, because
these orders would be filled

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.760
very quickly, if there's
a crossing.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:15.199
These two lines don't cross, so
it's like, if you plotted

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:19.699
these curves, they're supply
and demand curves, right?

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:23.480
We could plot the amount
at various prices.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:30.030
Well, you can see, I'd have
curves, a supply and demand

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:32.480
curve, that don't cross.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.159
Normally, they have to cross
somewhere, and then, there's a

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:37.325
market-clearing price.

00:34:37.325 --> 00:34:40.220
These things normally don't
cross, because, if they did

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:42.770
cross, it would immediately
disappear from the screen.

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:46.410
Someone would finish the order
and there'd be a sell.

00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:50.590
But you, sitting at the screen,
now have a pretty good

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:53.300
idea what the price is.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:59.060
A NASDAQ level II is better
than an NASDAQ level I,

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.790
because level I just gives
you the first row.

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:05.180
It's cheaper to subscribe
to that.

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:09.340
What NASDAQ level I gives you,
is the inside spread.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:15.930
It would tell you, that there is
a 100 shares bid at $25.23

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:22.000
and ask at $25.24, and if you
want to hit that order, you

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.780
could take either
side of that.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:28.320
But it doesn't tell you
the whole picture.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:32.330
If you know NASDAQ level II, you
know a lot more about the

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:35.510
market, and if you're going to
play the game of trading, you

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:36.840
want to know this.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.670
So for example, you know that
it might be hard for a price

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:46.190
to fall rapidly below $25.22,
because there's a big buyer

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:49.370
down there, and so it's going
to be hard for the price to

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:50.940
fall below that.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.710
If you saw this screen in real
life, these numbers would be

00:35:56.710 --> 00:36:00.460
just blinking, changing
rapidly before you.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:05.390
And trades that were there
20 seconds ago would

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:09.710
be gone in a flash.

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:14.580
So, you've got to move fast
to execute these trades.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:19.030
On a fully automated system, the
trades would be executed

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:21.200
automatically, and this
is becoming --

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.100
electronic trading is taking
over the world.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:31.110
And the orders can be executed
by computers that make it

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:35.300
instant, so that the number
doesn't even appear on the

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:38.380
screen long enough for
you to see it.

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:41.970
So, one development that's
coming in now is, what's

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:56.270
called ''high frequency
trading,'' HFT, which is

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:59.660
trading that is done
by computers.

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.590
Once you have a system
like this --

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:04.090
when you have to trade through a
floor broker on the New York

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:07.710
Stock Exchange, it has to
proceed at human pace, right?

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:09.790
The way it works is, you make
a telephone call to your

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:13.630
broker, your broker makes
another telephone call to the

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:16.820
representative on the floor of
the New York Stock exchange,

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:20.940
that person walks over to the
crowd, and then discusses it,

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.090
and indicates what --

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:24.890
it's like a poker game.

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:27.050
You don't want to reveal your
hand, but you kind of feel

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:28.950
people out, and then
after a little

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:32.910
discussion you reach a trade.

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:34.940
But when you have something
that you can hit on a

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.140
computer, it just
goes instantly.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:42.100
So, people start programming
trading, and that's been an

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:46.600
important phenomenon, because
you see these moving faster

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.590
than you can --

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:52.110
these prices disappear and
reappear so fast that you

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:57.430
can't quite know, you can't
act fast enough.

00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:04.680
So, we have algorithmic trading,
or program trading.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:15.700
So, that goes back practically
to the 1970s.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.680
Certainly by the '80s, program
trading was becoming a big and

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:24.140
important phenomenon, and it's
becoming increasingly

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.730
important now.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:29.550
High frequency trading now --

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:33.030
brokers will invoke what are
called ''millisecond

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:37.900
strategies.'' You can actually
flash an order on some of the

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.680
exchanges that lasts a
thousandth of a second.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:45.880
You can put a buy order or a
sell order, and retract it in

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.660
a millisecond.

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:49.920
This could be a trading
strategy,

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.270
which you might employ.

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:52.870
You could do that to

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:55.000
discourage people from trading.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.180
If you want to trade only with
the computers, if you think

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:01.180
people are too smart for me,
I don't want to trade with

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:04.250
people, I want to rip off the
computers, then you write a

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:11.730
millisecond trading strategy,
and then you can sort who

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:12.980
trades with you.

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:18.670
Now, the interesting thing about
millisecond trading is

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:23.390
that it's favoring the
electronic exchanges.

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:25.100
As time goes on, people are
getting more and more

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:30.670
sophisticated about high
frequency trading, and so they

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:33.230
want to trade on exchanges that
are fully electronic, so

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:36.050
they can play all
of these games.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.920
And that means that the floor
exchanges are dying out over

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.420
most of the world.

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:45.680
By the way, the New York
Stock Exchange --

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.310
I was going to give you
a history of this --

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:51.200
the New York Stock Exchange
has been slow to adapt to

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.140
these technologies.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.150
Let me just give you a little
history of -- electronic

00:39:55.150 --> 00:40:03.340
trading is an exciting thing for
many people, but, I think,

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:04.970
it started --

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:10.070
or the really interesting
electronic trading started

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:15.570
with the ECNs, electronic
communication networks, that

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:19.290
were allowed by the Securities
and Exchange Commission as

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:21.070
alternatives to stock
exchanges.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:24.790
Stock exchanges are highly
regulated by governments

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:32.290
around the world, but in the
1990s, the Securities and

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:38.000
Exchange Commission allowed more
sophisticated electronic

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.300
trading, at least as
an experiment.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.370
So, they didn't call these
things exchanges,

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:46.060
they called them ECNs.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.920
One of the most important ECNs
was a company called

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.170
Archipelago.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.160
Another one was called Island.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.600
And these were actually just
websites, where you could

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.290
trade, and they were
open to the public.

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:03.610
They had a different culture.

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:05.520
They had more of
a web culture.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.850
The web culture is, we're not
going to charge you to see the

00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:11.940
order book, we'll just put
it out to everybody.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:15.180
The web doesn't charge you
for a lot of things.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:18.290
And so, they became popular
trading sites

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:20.440
for the general public.

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:23.370
They grew up the way the
personal computer grew, so the

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:26.530
New York Stock Exchange, when
they first saw Archipelago,

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:28.670
they said, oh, this is a bunch
of college kids fooling

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:32.470
around, some computer
game, sort of.

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:34.690
And they didn't take
it seriously.

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:37.510
But eventually, the New York
Stock Exchange had to take it

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:41.350
seriously, because Archipelago
was growing so fast. So

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:44.420
eventually, the New York Stock
Exchange merged with

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:45.670
Archipelago.

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:51.460
So, they're now --

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.325
I think most of their trades
go through ARCX.

00:41:54.325 --> 00:41:57.050
I'm not sure if that's right,
but a large fraction of their

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:58.300
trades go through ARCX.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:16.500
So, the New York Stock
Exchange bought

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:21.060
Archipelago in 2005.

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:27.390
And at that time, ARCX was
breathing close on New York

00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:31.390
Stock Exchange for
trading volume.

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:33.870
Things are happening fast in
the stock exchange, because

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:35.650
the technology is changing.

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:38.600
Whereas we had the New York
Stock Exchange in the old

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.680
days, it was this single
prestigious exchange that

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.980
lasted for over 150 years
without any substantive

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:49.310
change, but now electronic
trading is coming in and

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:52.450
everything is being shaken up.

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:55.320
So, the New York Stock
Exchange merged with

00:42:55.320 --> 00:43:01.650
Archipelago in 2005, and then
they did another merger --

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:02.240
let's say this --

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:11.640
New York Stock Exchange, with
Euronext, which is another

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:17.970
exchange in Europe, in 2006.

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:24.070
And right now, they're going
through another merger

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:30.370
process, apparently with
the Deutsche Boerse.

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:35.650
And that's 2011.

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:37.890
It's not finalized yet.

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:42.180
And now NASDAQ is getting in,
NASDAQ is making an offer for

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:45.750
the New York Stock Exchange,
and so is another exchange

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:46.973
called the Intercontinental
Exchange.

00:43:46.973 --> 00:43:47.157
[addition: The description
of these events is as

00:43:47.157 --> 00:43:48.960
of April 13, 2011.]

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.890
But the little guys are buying
up the old-time big

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:55.140
guys, so it's --

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:58.150
Laura Cha was saying in her
lecture, that she was struck,

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:02.460
that we used to think of stock
exchanges as like utilities,

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.550
each country has its own stock
exchange, it's the pride of

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:08.900
each country, but now it's
not happening anymore.

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:12.750
And this reflects a bigger and
broader trend that economies

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:15.240
are becoming more and more
integrated across the world.

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.050
So, the idea that there would
be a stock exchange for each

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:23.350
country is becoming dated.

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:27.350
So, the New York Stock Exchange
may soon be a German

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:33.360
company, but that's what happens
in modern times.

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:50.000
I want to talk about some
problems with high frequency

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.395
trading, as things get
so electronic.

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.760
Let me give you one example.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:05.580
In 1987, this was the early days
of electronic trading,

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:09.260
but still it had advanced
pretty far.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:15.470
On October 19 of 1987, the stock
markets in the United

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:24.630
States fell, according to the
S&amp;P 500, over 20% in one day.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:31.540
The government did a study,
President Regan ordered a

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:37.040
study, and put it in charge
of Nicholas Brady.

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:42.190
And so, the so-called Brady
Commission did a report on why

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:45.180
the stock market -- that was
the biggest single stock

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:48.490
market drop in U.S. history.

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:52.010
And the Brady Commission did a
report on that stock market

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:57.070
drop, and concluded that program
trading, computer

00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:01.320
trading, had played a big
role in the drop.

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:06.110
There had been a development of
programs that were called

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:11.530
''portfolio insurance sell
strategies.'' They called it

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:15.110
portfolio insurance, but it
wasn't really insurance.

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:17.575
It was an automatic
sell strategy.

00:46:17.575 --> 00:46:21.860
It's like a stop loss order, but
a more sophisticated one

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:27.540
that could be executed in
continuous time by a program.

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:33.980
And that led to an instability
in the market that was not

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:37.740
anticipated and shocked
the world.

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:41.510
So, the Brady Commission made
a number of recommendations,

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:47.870
notably the commission
recommended that the exchanges

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:56.530
impose trading halts that would
prevent stocks, the

00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:59.940
whole market, from crashing.

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:03.320
So, the New York Stock Exchange
and other exchanges,

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:07.140
after the Brady Commission
report, instituted what are

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:14.300
called ''circuit breakers.'' And
these are automatic market

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:17.480
halts that stop the market, when
prices are falling, to

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:22.210
help prevent another 1987-type
stock market crash.

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:32.090
But the system is getting
complicated.

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:34.510
Even before this, the
United States

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:36.840
government had created --

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:46.190
had passed a set of rules in
response to complaints about

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:49.400
people not being given
the best price.

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.590
So, here's the problem.

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:52.890
We have multiple exchanges.

00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:01.230
The New York Stock Exchange is
one of many, and if you call a

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:07.660
stockbroker, the stockbroker
has discretion over which

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:11.670
exchange the broker will
use to fill your order.

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:15.100
And so, the broker might
choose an exchange that

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:17.530
doesn't give you
the best price.

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:23.120
The broker can, in effect,
rip you off as a broker.

00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:27.310
In fact, there's a practice
called ''payment for order

00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:39.090
flow.'' So, a stockbroker, who's
receiving orders from

00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:43.800
retail clients, may find that
there is a dealer that's

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:48.840
willing to pay for order flow.

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:52.280
When a customer asks to buy
the stock, don't put it

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.590
through the New York Stock
Exchange, give it to me.

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:57.950
And I'll give you, the broker,
a fee for directing

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:00.360
the order my way.

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:05.050
And that may not serve the
client well, because the

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:07.720
client then might end up
paying a higher price.

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:12.190
So, there were a lot of
complaints about this, and

00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:15.050
it's a difficult problem,
because it's hard to monitor

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:16.680
everything that people do.

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:19.240
And there might be
justifications for payment for

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.610
order flow.

00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:23.390
But there've been efforts
to try to

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:25.520
make it a fairer system.

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:31.640
And in 1975, the U.S. Congress
set up something called the

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:32.890
National Market System.

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:52.910
So, NMS is the National Market
System, and the ITS is the

00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:55.470
Intermarket Trading System.

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:58.510
What the government in the
United States did is, it said

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:03.380
that brokers have to get the
best price, what's called

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:11.170
''best bid, best offer'' for
their clients, and they have a

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:16.340
responsibility for their clients
to take the market

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.785
with the best price.

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:27.880
In conjunction with this, the
exchanges built something

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:32.950
called the ''consolidated
quotation system,'' that

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:39.370
allows brokers to see prices
on various exchanges and

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:44.410
direct the order of the client
to the exchange that's showing

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:47.600
the best price.

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.910
So, that is the system that
was started in the United

00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:55.650
States in 1975, and brokers
still have an obligation to

00:50:55.650 --> 00:50:58.220
get the best price for
their customers

00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:00.780
regardless of exchange.

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:06.330
But the obligation is hard for
the government to monitor, and

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:08.670
it gets complicated.

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:12.530
For example, if you're
confronting this system, and

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:17.420
your broker wants 500 shares,
well, I can't fill them all at

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:20.540
the same price, right?

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:24.520
Well, actually I could here.

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:27.690
If the broker wanted 10,000
shares, they'd be all

00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:30.810
different prices, because I
have all these different

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:34.010
customers asking different
amounts.

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:36.840
So what do you want
us to do, SEC?

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:40.510
And so the SEC recently
clarified this.

00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:42.480
I think, it was in 2006.

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:47.570
Well, we only mean that
you have to get this,

00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:48.390
this one up here --

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:50.880
2,400 for $25.24.

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:52.190
How do you fill the others?

00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:53.800
Well, we can't get into that.

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:57.680
So, it's not a complete
protection for customers, but

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:02.730
there still is this obligation
for brokers to use the

00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:06.660
National Market System to
get the best price.

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:11.010
But the system is complicated
and confusing, because there's

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:12.980
so many computers involved,
there's so many different

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.620
exchanges, and there's
so many rules.

00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:17.795
It's hard for people to
keep up with it all.

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:34.210
On the reading list I had
a report that I --

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:35.260
I found the report.

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:37.930
It was very much in the
news a while back.

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:47.170
This is a report
on May 6, 2010.

00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:49.000
Do you remember what
happened then?

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.020
That was not that long ago.

00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:56.100
The stock market, as of around
2:30 in the afternoon in the

00:52:56.100 --> 00:53:02.320
United States, had fallen 4%,
and then, within a matter of

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:07.235
minutes, it dropped another
6%, and then,

00:53:07.235 --> 00:53:09.210
it rebounded quickly.

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:13.900
Some individual stocks dropped
practically to nothing, and

00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:18.340
you could buy a $30 stock for
$0.30 something like that.

00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.080
And then, they rebounded.

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:21.330
So what happened?

00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:28.860
Why did we have this
very brief crash

00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:30.200
in the stock markets?

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.450
It wasn't like 1987, where
the market went

00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:35.610
down and stayed down.

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:39.030
If you look at closing prices,
nothing much happened.

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:42.240
It was this brief glitch,
which probably cost some

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.040
people huge amounts of money,
because, if you were trading

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:48.130
right at that moment, you'd
have a problem.

00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:50.820
So, I have as an optional
reading on the reading list a

00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:56.940
study, that was made of May
6, 2010 by the SEC and the

00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:59.800
Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, trying to

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:04.390
understand what happened then.

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:09.070
And the study does focus on
high frequency trading.

00:54:09.070 --> 00:54:13.350
There were a lot of computers
trading automatically at that

00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:14.670
moment in time.

00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:18.230
So, what apparently happened
on May 6 is, the market was

00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:22.960
already in a stressed
mode before 2:30 PM.

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:24.820
The VIX index had shot up.

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:27.770
There was some bad news --
the market was down 4% --

00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:30.050
there was some bad news.

00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:32.350
So, that meant that some
traders were wondering,

00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:33.300
what's going on?

00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:37.590
And maybe, they decided to drop
out for a while and just

00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:41.790
be cautious, but the computers
were still trading.

00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:43.690
And then, something happened.

00:54:43.690 --> 00:54:46.330
The computers started trading
back and forth in

00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:47.840
milliseconds.

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:51.180
And I don't know what the
programs were supposed to do

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:52.510
or what they --

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:54.620
maybe nobody knows the
whole picture --

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:58.800
but the volume of trade just
went to an astronomical level,

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:01.800
and it scared people off.

00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:05.810
And so, there were a lot of
trading pauses that were put.

00:55:05.810 --> 00:55:09.160
Exchanges have rules about that,
and individual dealers

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:10.480
will say, I'm dropping out.

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:13.920
I see all this volume, I'm
not in here anymore.

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:17.440
So, it remains that the trading
that was left was

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:23.180
substantially computer trading,
and the market became

00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:24.430
very illiquid.

00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:33.050
So, this study has recommended
fixes for this, but it doesn't

00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:36.570
recommend ending high
frequency trading.

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:39.200
A lot of people would recommend
doing that.

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:42.560
There's a popular anger,
especially since this May 6,

00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:48.180
2010 crisis occurred during
the period of financial

00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.590
crisis, and people
kind of imagine

00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:51.480
that the two are linked.

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.120
I think, they're kind
of independent.

00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:59.290
I think the May 6, 2010
phenomenon was due to some

00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:03.190
kind of anomalies, or
unfamiliarity with high

00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:05.070
frequency trading.

00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:11.750
It's a glitch and not a major
fault, but it lead to a lot of

00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:15.470
anger about high frequency
trading.

00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:17.500
I've talked to some people
at the Chicago Mercantile

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:22.940
Exchange and others, who think
that the public anxiety over

00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:25.930
high frequency trading
is misplaced.

00:56:25.930 --> 00:56:27.330
It's kind of inevitable.

00:56:27.330 --> 00:56:28.820
The future is computers.

00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:31.900
They're replacing
people all over.

00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:33.490
Not in a judgment thing.

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:35.880
You know, someone was saying
at the CME meeting, where I

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:39.780
was, that the basic business
that we're doing is still the

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:43.790
same as it was 100 years ago,
but now we have laptops.

00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:45.470
It's just like, when you
write a term paper.

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:48.310
It's basically the same thing
that somebody would have done

00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:53.200
with a feather pen and a piece
of paper 200 years ago.

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:53.440
Right?

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:55.020
It's basically the same.

00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:57.610
But we live in a computer
age now, and we

00:56:57.610 --> 00:56:59.350
don't want to go back.

00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:05.020
And so, high frequency trading
means that we have to be able

00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:08.270
careful, things can happen
with lightning speed, but

00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:09.520
we'll learn.

00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:14.790
There hasn't been another
May 6, 2010 since.

00:57:14.790 --> 00:57:18.090
It was just an anomaly, because
people were unfamiliar

00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:19.340
with that kind of event.

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:28.800
So, I think it will
be all right.

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.540
One thing that it does,
however, is it's

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.710
changing the geography.

00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:37.050
It used to be, that in the 18th
century, a stockbroker

00:57:37.050 --> 00:57:40.800
had to live in London or Paris
or New York in order to be

00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:43.640
close to the trading, because
they didn't have any way to

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:44.650
make phone calls.

00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:47.370
When they invented the
telephone, people said, fine,

00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:48.930
I don't have to live in
New York anymore.

00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:50.550
I can live in anywhere,
and I can just

00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:52.790
send my call by telephone.

00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:56.470
But now, high frequency trading
is bringing it back,

00:57:56.470 --> 00:58:00.720
that people have to live close
to the exchange because the

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:04.810
trading goes so fast, that your
electronic signal -- if

00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:08.020
you try to set up a high
frequency trading operation in

00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:12.150
St. Louis, and your operating by
wire to New York, the time

00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:16.270
it takes for electricity to get
from St. Louis to New York

00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:19.810
is too big, and you will
be behind on the trade.

00:58:19.810 --> 00:58:23.040
So, you want to get as close as
physically possible to the

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.320
exchange, to the computer.

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:32.370
The regional exchanges, there
used to be exchanges in every

00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:33.960
big U.S. city.

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:37.520
And they were there, because of
social reasons, that people

00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:40.160
in Chicago wanted to talk
to a broker in Chicago.

00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:43.186
They wanted to be able to go to
his office and see him, so

00:58:43.186 --> 00:58:45.560
there were social reasons
for connection.

00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:49.330
But now we're coming up with
a new electronic reason.

00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:53.350
And because of basic theoretical
physics, you can't

00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:55.990
move anything faster than
the speed of light.

00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:57.870
This is going to be with
us now that we

00:58:57.870 --> 00:59:00.815
have microsecond trading.

00:59:12.976 --> 00:59:16.850
I wanted to talk a little bit
now -- and I think maybe this

00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:18.870
would be the last topic --

00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:26.440
about how you think about
trading as a dealer, who is

00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:31.730
confronted with this
kind of book.

00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:36.860
As a dealer, you can put orders
on this book, and enter

00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:39.170
them, and leave them there.

00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:41.380
That's basically what you do.

00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:48.220
So, you see various dealers, and
their names are shown, and

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:52.480
for example, well, I don't know
who these people are.

00:59:52.480 --> 01:00:02.450
But each dealer is going to be
posting a bid and an ask, and

01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:04.870
a quantity for these.

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:09.560
And if you do this, if you're
sitting at your NASDAQ screen,

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:16.070
and you're a dealer, you can
enter your own number on

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:18.660
either the bid or the
ask or both of them.

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:21.155
So, you have your own
bid-ask spread.

01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:27.130
It's the same thing as
an antique dealer.

01:00:27.130 --> 01:00:29.990
An antique dealer
has an idea --

01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:34.420
maybe it's not posted -- of how
much he or she will pay

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:38.520
for a chest of drawers from a
Yale student at the end of the

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:42.990
semester, and how much he will
charge to sell that.

01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:47.900
And the difference between the
ask and the bid is called the

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:51.130
spread, or the bid-ask spread.

01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:53.010
So, I wanted to just think
a little bit about

01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:54.260
the theory of this.

01:00:57.850 --> 01:01:06.850
How do you decide of the bid-ask
spread of what to do?

01:01:06.850 --> 01:01:09.730
And why is it what it is?

01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:13.030
The spreads are obviously very
tight here, because they're

01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:19.770
off only by $0.01 on the inside
spread, but it doesn't

01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:21.260
correspond to one person.

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:23.200
Maybe some of these
are customer

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.960
orders and aren't dealers.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:28.230
But think of placing an order as
a dealer and leaving it on

01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:35.110
the screen, so that anybody
can come and --

01:01:35.110 --> 01:01:42.160
the risk that you face is, that
you will be picked off by

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.690
people with superior
information.

01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:49.570
And let me put it in the context
of an antique dealer.

01:01:49.570 --> 01:01:52.710
One thing, antique dealers
don't like is, when

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:57.150
professional antique dealers
come shopping in their store.

01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:58.030
So, what do they do?

01:01:58.030 --> 01:02:00.570
You know, if you're a good
antique dealer, you go to all

01:02:00.570 --> 01:02:03.360
the antique shows, you try to
disguise yourself, because

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.310
they don't want you,
if you're a dealer.

01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:06.390
What do you do?

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:08.900
You look through all their stuff
and you find anything

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:10.290
that's mispriced.

01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:13.430
You know, there will be some
chest of drawers that you

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:17.045
recognize as an 18th
century --

01:02:17.045 --> 01:02:24.540
by a famous furniture maker.

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:27.800
So, you buy that at
the guy's price.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.450
You pick him off, right?

01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:32.920
So, he doesn't want to be picked
off, because somebody

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.960
will come by, who knows more,
and will pick off all the good

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:39.610
stuff, and buy it, and leave
you with the junk.

01:02:39.610 --> 01:02:41.480
So, how do you prevent that?

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.980
Well, you might think that you
could prevent it by just being

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:47.500
smarter, but you can try it,
try to be as smart as you

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:49.770
want, and read up about all
the antiques, but it's

01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:51.070
impossible.

01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:53.230
You cannot be the smartest
guy out there.

01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:54.390
Impossible.

01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:57.520
There's just too many antiques,
and there's too much

01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.950
inside information.

01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:02.700
So, that means you have to set
your bid-ask spread wide

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:07.350
enough, that you can be picked
off and still make a profit.

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:09.950
You know you're going to get
picked off, and it's the same

01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:11.560
for stocks.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:14.800
If you're going to put a bid-ask
spread up on the

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:19.270
screen for some stock, you're
just a sitting duck, because

01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:22.590
there'll be some news story
that's either good or bad, and

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:26.060
if it's either way, somebody
else is going to hear of it

01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:29.590
first, and when you get a hit
on your order, it's going to

01:03:29.590 --> 01:03:33.100
be deadly, because it'll be
at the wrong time for you.

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:42.340
So, that's the theory, that you
have to make the bid-ask

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:44.590
spread wide enough.

01:03:44.590 --> 01:03:46.660
I wanted to then just give you
a little bit of math --

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.970
I shouldn't end a lecture on
mathematics, but that's what

01:03:48.970 --> 01:03:54.210
I'm doing here this time.

01:03:54.210 --> 01:03:56.030
And I wanted to just
talk about the

01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:58.530
frustrating life as a dealer.

01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:00.800
I was telling you about
frustrations in life as an

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.820
investment banker.

01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:04.730
There are different frustrations
in life as a

01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:08.280
dealer, and I'll tell you what
is the difference is.

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.040
Life as a dealer is very
different than life as an

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.210
employee or something.

01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:15.750
You are a dealer and you have
whatever money you make.

01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:19.040
And the problem is, you can
get ruined, and this

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.260
is a classic --

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:22.930
in other words, you can be
working as a dealer for 20

01:04:22.930 --> 01:04:26.640
years, and you see your
portfolio growing, because

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.790
you're making a lot
of money selling.

01:04:28.790 --> 01:04:31.960
But you know, all it takes is
a few bad moves, and you can

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.460
be wiped out.

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:37.380
You know, 20 years of work,
and you are ruined.

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:39.260
So, I wanted to just think about
that, and this is my

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:40.860
last bit of mathematics.

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:47.560
This is the mathematics of
Gambler's Ruin, and it's also

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:51.060
a mathematics of
Dealer's Ruin.

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:53.540
And so, here's the theory.

01:04:53.540 --> 01:05:01.700
If I start up with S dollars,
S is my initial amount of

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:03.860
money as a dealer.

01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:10.040
And let's say I take a series
of bets, which have a

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.650
probability --

01:05:11.650 --> 01:05:15.510
p is the probability of a win.

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:27.445
What is the probability
of eventual ruin?

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:39.960
Oh, and I make $1 on each win
and I lose $1 on each -- minus

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:41.360
$1 on each loss --

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.690
I'm doing a sequence
of bets --

01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:45.940
on each loss.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:51.415
What is the probability that I
will eventually be ruined?

01:05:58.530 --> 01:06:04.400
That probability, and I'm not
going to derive this, but it's

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.490
simple to derive, actually.

01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:15.940
1 minus p over p, to the
Sth power, if p is

01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:18.710
greater than 1/2.

01:06:31.170 --> 01:06:37.850
So, if my probability of
winning is 1/2, the

01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:40.660
probability of my being ruined
eventually is 1.

01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:48.600
And if my probability of winning
is less than 1/2, my

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:55.170
probability of being ruined
eventually is also 1.

01:06:55.170 --> 01:07:02.470
I have to somehow raise the
probability of winning on each

01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:08.390
particular sale above 1/2, but
even if I do that, if I make

01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:14.380
it, say, 0.6, if I make the
probability 60% on one bet,

01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:23.840
then 1 minus 0.6 is 0.4 over
0.6, then my probability of

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:27.680
eventual ruin, starting
out with $1 is 4/6,

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.160
if I did that right.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:32.590
Goes down with the number of
dollars I start with, but it

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.650
never goes to zero.

01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:38.790
So, the theory of a dealer is
that a dealer has to be

01:07:38.790 --> 01:07:41.140
thinking about being
ripped off.

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:44.390
I've got to set my bid-ask
spread high enough, that the

01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:48.110
probability of winning on each
of these little trades that I

01:07:48.110 --> 01:07:54.900
make is sufficiently above a
1/2, that my eventual ruin

01:07:54.900 --> 01:08:00.450
probability is satisfactorily
low for me.

01:08:00.450 --> 01:08:02.560
But it's never going
to be zero.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:08.769
This is the irony of
being a dealer.

01:08:11.830 --> 01:08:16.240
You don't sleep well at night,
because you never know that it

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.830
won't eventually unwind.

01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:21.660
And it's a competitive business,
because you can't

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:25.180
just set your bid-ask spread
arbitrarily high, because then

01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:27.740
you lose all the business
to other people.

01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:31.510
So, you've got to kind of fix
the bid-ask spread enough,

01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:35.470
that you get business, but you
don't want to fix it too

01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:39.850
narrowly, so that this
probability falls too close to

01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:44.050
1/2, because then you're
courting the risk of disaster,

01:08:44.050 --> 01:08:46.160
and eventually having
all of your life's

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.430
work being wiped out.

01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:52.439
So, that was kind of a quick
description of the --

01:08:52.439 --> 01:08:54.510
I've said, different
personalities go into

01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:56.120
different parts of finance.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:59.880
You have to be kind of a game
player, someone who is not

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:04.200
bothered by the possibility of
eventual ruin, in order to go

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:07.670
into becoming a dealer.

01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:11.439
Very different from other
aspects of financial life.

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:11.770
All right.

01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:15.439
I'll see you soon with --

01:09:15.439 --> 01:09:18.130
we're getting close to the
end of the semester.

01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:19.380
Some wrap-up lectures coming.

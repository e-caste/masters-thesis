00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.531
Prof: Okay we're going
to talk about several different

00:00:03.531 --> 00:00:05.344
things today,
several different texts,

00:00:05.344 --> 00:00:08.039
because we're coming up to the
end of the semester.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:12.744
I often conclude with two
different lectures that talk

00:00:12.744 --> 00:00:16.029
about the rise of
institutionalism and

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.580
institutionalization of the
church,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.280
but I've decided this year to
combine them into one.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.060
That's why your reading list,
your reading for today,

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.070
had some canonical material,
the letters of Ignatius,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.790
you're also asked to read the
Didache,

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.143
another non-canonical early
Christian writing because I want

00:00:35.143 --> 00:00:37.190
to pull different themes
together.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.290
So next time,
the last class of the course,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.779
the last lecture,
I want to then address the

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:47.600
kinds of big questions you might
have been having all semester,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.247
which can be something like,
how did this little bitty group

00:00:52.247 --> 00:00:57.131
of people following this unknown
Jew in Syrian Palestine in the

00:00:57.131 --> 00:01:01.070
first century become this huge
world religion?

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.933
What's the continuity,
if any, because I've been

00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.356
stressing all--
in the whole semester the

00:01:06.356 --> 00:01:09.799
differences between contemporary
notions about Christianity,

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.607
what Christianity is,
what is orthodox Christianity

00:01:12.607 --> 00:01:15.927
for people in our day and age,
what people assume Christianity

00:01:15.927 --> 00:01:16.590
is all about.
 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.385
I've been talking about how
that's very different from the

00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:22.280
canonical Christianity that we
see in the New Testament,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.662
and it's even more different
from some of the non-canonical

00:01:24.662 --> 00:01:27.209
Christianity that we've seen in
things like the Acts of Paul

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.989
and Thecla.
 

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:31.299
Next time I will talk about the
bigger issue of the growth of

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.772
Christianity from this fledgling
little movement and a few house

00:01:34.772 --> 00:01:37.806
churches scattered around in
Greek cities in the Eastern

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:38.910
Mediterranean.
 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.503
I'll also talk next time a
little about what is post-modern

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:45.879
interpretation of scripture.
 

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:48.432
I did talk a bit about the
theological interpretation of

00:01:48.432 --> 00:01:50.893
scripture and how that's
different from the historical

00:01:50.893 --> 00:01:53.492
critical interpretation of
scripture that you're learning

00:01:53.492 --> 00:01:54.560
in this semester.
 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.566
If you really want to get into
theological interpretation of

00:01:57.566 --> 00:02:00.370
scripture in an academic
environment you need to do that

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.328
through something like the
Divinity School or in a seminary

00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:05.650
because that's,
of course, where they're

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.650
supposed to be teaching people
how to interpret this text for

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.000
contemporary Christians.
 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.528
That's not what we're going to
talk about in this course most

00:02:12.528 --> 00:02:13.120
of the time.
 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.050
I have hinted at that,
but there's also a way of

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.980
approaching scripture that might
be considered not the canonical

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.786
traditional way of theological
interpretation and also not the

00:02:23.786 --> 00:02:27.030
modernist way of modern
historical criticism,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.054
and that's what we might call
post-modern approaches to the

00:02:31.054 --> 00:02:32.854
text,
and even to the text as

00:02:32.854 --> 00:02:33.830
scripture itself.
 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.025
Next time I'll address some of
those bigger issues about the

00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:40.275
New Testament that I've kind of
put on the side for the whole

00:02:40.275 --> 00:02:40.979
semester.
 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:44.428
Today we're taking a first step
toward that because I'm going to

00:02:44.428 --> 00:02:47.220
look at some canonical material
in this lecture,

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.973
but I'm also going to look at
the letters of Ignatius and the

00:02:50.973 --> 00:02:54.538
Didache to show you how
the church started becoming

00:02:54.538 --> 00:02:58.292
institutionalized in ways that
look more familiar to us after

00:02:58.292 --> 00:03:01.419
the period of the New Testament
composition.

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:07.500
How do you create and maintain
unity in a social movement?

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.722
That's what early Christian
leaders had to face pretty

00:03:10.722 --> 00:03:11.330
quickly.
 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.405
We've already seen that in
Paul's letters,

00:03:13.405 --> 00:03:13.810
right?
 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.370
In 1 Corinthians shows a church
that is at odds with itself.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.318
People disagreeing about what
the basic nature of the Gospel

00:03:20.318 --> 00:03:22.641
is,
and Paul writes 1 Corinthians

00:03:22.641 --> 00:03:24.393
in order,
the whole theme of 1

00:03:24.393 --> 00:03:26.872
Corinthians is,
you are the united body of

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:28.960
Christ now start acting like it.
 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.151
And so Paul's trying to get a
fractured church to see so it's

00:03:32.151 --> 00:03:32.628
united.
 

00:03:32.628 --> 00:03:35.532
There are different ways you
can see this being done in early

00:03:35.532 --> 00:03:36.258
Christianity.
 

00:03:36.258 --> 00:03:39.590
Paul, of course,
didn't have church structures

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.699
to appeal to.
 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.830
Paul couldn't say something
like, if you have a question go

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:44.750
to your bishop.
 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.907
He also couldn't say,
look at the New Testament,

00:03:46.907 --> 00:03:48.699
he was writing it at the
time.

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.240
There wasn't anything like that
to look at.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.419
Paul exercised his own
charismatic authority.

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.494
By that, we mean that in the
sort of Weberian sociological

00:03:56.494 --> 00:03:59.729
sense of an authority that
doesn't derive from an office,

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:03.218
from any kind of official
office that Paul had,

00:04:03.218 --> 00:04:05.438
but it derives from simply his
force of character.

00:04:05.438 --> 00:04:10.269
When someone has a leadership
position that derives more from

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.494
their personality,
their force of character,

00:04:13.494 --> 00:04:17.115
their ideas than it does from
an official office then that's

00:04:17.115 --> 00:04:20.430
charismatic authority as opposed
to an official kind of

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.209
institutional authority.
 

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:23.819
That's what Paul had to deal
with.

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:25.891
That's what all the earliest
leaders of these little house

00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:26.910
churches had to deal with.
 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.720
They had to push their own
ideas of what the church meant,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.910
of what the body of Christ
meant, of what was proper

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.637
ethics,
of what proper interpretation

00:04:35.637 --> 00:04:37.329
of scripture,
and they had to do it on the

00:04:37.329 --> 00:04:39.660
strength of their own character
and their force of personality.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.473
That was one way that people
tried to create unity in this

00:04:43.473 --> 00:04:45.279
early fledgling movement.
 

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:47.238
Gradually, of course,
you have other ways of

00:04:47.238 --> 00:04:47.829
developing.
 

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:51.458
Another way of developing unity
that we see around this time is

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:52.980
hierarchical leadership.
 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.910
You have officers,
you have people who are either

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.267
elected or appointed as
officers, and they control unity

00:04:59.267 --> 00:05:01.709
and enforce unity from the top
down.

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:04.511
And you can see this,
therefore, in modern

00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:07.449
Christianity,
modern religious movements.

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.920
The Roman Catholic Church has
bishops, and cardinals,

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.209
and the Pope.
 

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:16.711
And everybody who knows
anything about Roman Catholicism

00:05:16.711 --> 00:05:19.958
knows that what the Pope and the
cardinals say goes,

00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.550
or it's supposed too.
 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.706
American Roman Catholics and a
lot of northern western European

00:05:25.706 --> 00:05:29.595
Catholics sometimes don't go
along with The Vatican on many

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:32.324
things,
but the structure of the Roman

00:05:32.324 --> 00:05:36.303
Catholic Church is intended to
help maintain unity by the means

00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:39.639
of an official hierarchical
leadership structure.

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.004
You also have different
Protestant ways to do this which

00:05:43.004 --> 00:05:45.329
are constitutional kinds of
systems.

00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:49.355
When say, the Presbyterians,
have debates about whether to

00:05:49.355 --> 00:05:52.971
ordain homosexuals,
whether to allow gay marriages,

00:05:52.971 --> 00:05:56.045
the ordination of women,
which was the debate that

00:05:56.045 --> 00:05:59.274
really rocked the Presbyterian
church and many other churches

00:05:59.274 --> 00:06:01.901
back in the 1970s,
most of them got over that by

00:06:01.901 --> 00:06:03.740
now;
now the thing that's rocking

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.819
them is sexuality.
 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:08.064
When they had disagreements
they would go to the general

00:06:08.064 --> 00:06:10.127
convention,
which occurs every year,

00:06:10.127 --> 00:06:13.327
and you have people elected out
of different local churches and

00:06:13.327 --> 00:06:14.769
parishes,
and presbyteries,

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:16.629
they call them the Presbyterian
Church,

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:19.367
and those people who are
themselves basically elected

00:06:19.367 --> 00:06:22.367
from their local churches and
their local presbyteries are

00:06:22.367 --> 00:06:24.790
representatives to the general
convention.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.170
It looks very much like
American politics.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.930
It's not much of an accident.
 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.870
The American Constitution to
some extent,

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.029
is based on what was a more
Presbyterian Protestant kind of

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:38.569
church polity,
of having different houses of

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:40.389
representatives and this sort of
thing.

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:43.339
So American denominations,
Protestant denominations,

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:45.490
which were growing up at the
same time,

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.259
as different Protestant
movements were growing up,

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:51.321
and at the same time as
American constitutionalism was

00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:53.940
growing up,
all influenced each other.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.336
That's another way to maintain
unity that Protestant churches

00:06:57.336 --> 00:06:58.129
tend to use.
 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:01.273
Then you have other churches in
America that are very free

00:07:01.273 --> 00:07:01.879
churches.
 

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:04.653
I grew up in a denomination
that didn't even call itself a

00:07:04.653 --> 00:07:07.136
denomination because it
considered itself simply the

00:07:07.136 --> 00:07:09.043
Church,
called the Church of Christ,

00:07:09.043 --> 00:07:11.930
and the Churches of Christ
don't have any national offices,

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.014
no place you can go anywhere in
the world like there are for

00:07:15.014 --> 00:07:17.942
most other denominations that
have a national office with

00:07:17.942 --> 00:07:20.923
officers and set rules and
decide on hymn books and decide

00:07:20.923 --> 00:07:22.649
on Sunday school materials.
 

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:24.850
There's nothing like that
anywhere in the world.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.949
These churches are all
completely autonomous and

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:29.730
individual to themselves.
 

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.351
They appoint their own
officers, they decide what is

00:07:33.351 --> 00:07:35.980
doctrine and what is not
doctrine,

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.940
they hire and fire their own
ministers,

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.533
and not even the ministers of
these churches are the highest

00:07:40.533 --> 00:07:41.149
authorities.
 

00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:43.528
They basically preach and
teach, but they're not the ones

00:07:43.528 --> 00:07:45.732
who actually run the churches,
so each individual

00:07:45.732 --> 00:07:48.274
church--there are lots of
churches like that in the United

00:07:48.274 --> 00:07:48.720
States.
 

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.966
There are a lot of Baptist
churches that aren't even part

00:07:50.966 --> 00:07:52.449
of the Southern Baptist
Convention.

00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:55.091
There are lots of free churches
and some of them would even have

00:07:55.091 --> 00:07:56.810
"free"
as part of their name.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.339
Of course in America this is
not at all unusual.

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:02.242
Anybody can rent out a
storefront and start their own

00:08:02.242 --> 00:08:04.420
church, and many people have
done so.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.105
These kinds of churches,
it's remarkable that the

00:08:07.105 --> 00:08:10.004
denomination I grew up in,
although there's no

00:08:10.004 --> 00:08:13.360
meta-congregational organization
that runs this,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.360
it's amazing how much alike
they are.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.593
When I was a kid I would travel
to Alabama, or to Maryland,

00:08:21.593 --> 00:08:22.250
or to St.
 

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:25.680
Louis, Missouri,
and you would go to a Church of

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.721
Christ,
as long as it said it on its

00:08:27.721 --> 00:08:29.709
sign and it was one of the same
kinds we went to,

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:31.040
and the services would be the
same,

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.870
They sing the same songs,
they have the same doctrine.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.018
It's almost like somebody wrote
it all out and said,

00:08:36.018 --> 00:08:37.830
this is what you'll do on
Sunday morning.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.350
The amazing thing was nobody
had written it all out.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:44.328
It was just done by the sheer
nature of these churches of

00:08:44.328 --> 00:08:48.095
being very close knit and sort
of ruling each other by

00:08:48.095 --> 00:08:51.932
threatening to dis-fellowship
you if you didn't do like

00:08:51.932 --> 00:08:53.710
everybody else did.
 

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.710
There was a great amount of
cohesiveness.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.118
In fact, I remember being
astounded when I was twenty

00:08:58.118 --> 00:09:00.616
years old,
and I was in a rock band at my

00:09:00.616 --> 00:09:03.346
college,
and we did a two-month tour for

00:09:03.346 --> 00:09:06.389
the USO playing on military
bases all over--

00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:08.582
in Japan, Taiwan,
Okinawa, Hawaii,

00:09:08.582 --> 00:09:10.548
the South Pacific,
different places,

00:09:10.548 --> 00:09:11.120
the Philippines.
 

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.047
And we would actually--because
the college I went to was a

00:09:14.047 --> 00:09:16.923
Church of Christ College we
would often visit a Church of

00:09:16.923 --> 00:09:19.389
Christ in Tokyo or wherever we
were in Asia.

00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:20.330
It was amazing.
 

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.331
You would go in,
and although everything was in

00:09:22.331 --> 00:09:24.639
Japanese, it was exactly like it
was back in Texas.

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:27.830
There was no organization
forcing this.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:32.336
It was just the cohesiveness of
the socialization of these

00:09:32.336 --> 00:09:33.840
different groups.
 

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.279
What we're going to see today
is the move in early

00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:41.988
Christianity,
the very beginnings of the move

00:09:41.988 --> 00:09:44.554
from this freewheeling,
charismatic,

00:09:44.554 --> 00:09:47.472
structureless kind of
organization structure and

00:09:47.472 --> 00:09:51.197
authority practice that we see
in Paul's letters and in other

00:09:51.197 --> 00:09:53.620
documents we've looked at so
far,

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.157
and we're going to see a move
towards more

00:09:55.157 --> 00:09:56.019
institutionalization.
 

00:09:56.019 --> 00:09:58.480
It's not going to be the
Catholic Church yet,

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.359
it's not going to be what
becomes Christianity in the

00:10:01.359 --> 00:10:04.216
fourth and fifth centuries,
when it does become much more

00:10:04.216 --> 00:10:04.960
highly organized.
 

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.090
But we're going to start seeing
that move.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.751
We see the move a little bit
already in the letter of Jude,

00:10:10.751 --> 00:10:13.720
so open your Bibles and look
with me at Jude.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:20.428
Jude claims to be the brother
of James,

00:10:20.428 --> 00:10:23.826
and scholars think most of the
time what he's trying to do is

00:10:23.826 --> 00:10:26.090
claim that he's the brother of
James,

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.908
who was the head of the
Jerusalem Church,

00:10:27.908 --> 00:10:29.490
that is, James the brother of
Jesus.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:34.047
Jude, by that figuring,
would also make himself the

00:10:34.047 --> 00:10:35.779
brother of Jesus.
 

00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:42.100
Mark 6:3 or Matthew 13:55 links
these guys together.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.759
What most scholars think is
that this pseudonymous,

00:10:44.759 --> 00:10:48.243
you won't be surprised now to
know that we don't think the

00:10:48.243 --> 00:10:51.849
brother of Jesus or the brother
of James actually wrote this

00:10:51.849 --> 00:10:52.399
text.
 

00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:56.594
What we know of Judas,
who would have been and of

00:10:56.594 --> 00:11:00.440
course as I think I've explained
already,

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.200
"Jude"
is simply the Anglicization of

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.477
the Greek name Judas,
which is simply a Greek version

00:11:06.477 --> 00:11:09.525
of the Hebrew name Judah,
so they all refer basically to

00:11:09.525 --> 00:11:10.250
the same name.
 

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.660
Jude, or Judas,
or Judah was--if he was a

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.840
brother of Jesus as the Gospels
seem to imply,

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.000
then he was an illiterate
fisherman,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.778
and we don't think someone with
his background,

00:11:22.778 --> 00:11:25.537
with his lack of education
would have been able to write

00:11:25.537 --> 00:11:26.240
this letter.
 

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.871
So that's the reason we
basically assign it to

00:11:28.871 --> 00:11:29.750
pseudonymity.
 

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.058
He's dealing with some
divisions;

00:11:33.058 --> 00:11:34.952
I'm not going to go through the
letter very much because I want

00:11:34.952 --> 00:11:36.450
to move ahead to some of these
other documents.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:40.049
There are signs,
like I talked about with 1 and

00:11:40.049 --> 00:11:43.729
2 Peter last time,
that this is a post-apostolic

00:11:43.729 --> 00:11:44.590
letter.
 

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:49.033
One of those is verse 3:
Beloved while eagerly preparing

00:11:49.033 --> 00:11:52.149
to write you about the salvation
we share,

00:11:52.149 --> 00:11:55.264
I find it necessary to write
and to appeal to you to contend

00:11:55.264 --> 00:11:58.538
for the faith that was once for
all entrusted to the saints.

00:11:58.538 --> 00:12:02.432
This faith is this thing that
was delivered to the saints at

00:12:02.432 --> 00:12:03.158
one time.
 

00:12:03.158 --> 00:12:08.019
He also talks in verse 17 about
the Apostles,

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:10.414
But you, beloved,
must remember the predictions

00:12:10.414 --> 00:12:12.288
of the apostles of our Lord
Jesus;

00:12:12.288 --> 00:12:14.442
for they said to you,
"In the last time there

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:16.990
will be scoffers indulging their
own ungodly lust."

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.283
So he sees himself living in
the last times,

00:12:19.283 --> 00:12:22.379
but he didn't see the apostles
living in the last times.

00:12:22.379 --> 00:12:25.245
Even though Peter,
and James, and John saw

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:28.178
themselves as living in the last
times,

00:12:28.178 --> 00:12:31.289
he's living far enough after
them so that he could put them

00:12:31.289 --> 00:12:33.990
in a prior time,
a sort of apostolic stage of

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.653
the church,
and now he's writing in the

00:12:36.653 --> 00:12:37.490
last times.
 

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.798
So this is a post-apostolic
letter.

00:12:39.798 --> 00:12:43.533
But it's also pre-canonical,
as I said last time talking

00:12:43.533 --> 00:12:44.620
about 2 Peter.
 

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.799
Remember I talked about how 2
Peter uses this letter of Jude

00:12:47.799 --> 00:12:51.087
as a model for his own letter,
and he quotes stuff out of out,

00:12:51.087 --> 00:12:52.490
takes stuff out of it.
 

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.840
One of the things,
though, 2 Peter did was,

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.350
he took out the stuff that he
found in Jude that was not

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.908
canonical,
that he didn't believe was part

00:13:00.908 --> 00:13:01.970
of the real Bible.
 

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.990
But Jude has it in there.
 

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.734
In verse 9, "But when the
archangel Michael contended with

00:13:07.734 --> 00:13:10.875
the devil and disputed about the
body of Moses,"

00:13:10.875 --> 00:13:13.169
and he goes on says what
happened.

00:13:13.169 --> 00:13:14.169
Well, why does this happen?
 

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:15.470
Is this in your Bible?
 

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.278
Nope, it's not in your Bible.
 

00:13:17.278 --> 00:13:20.206
Michael never disputed about
what to do with the body of

00:13:20.206 --> 00:13:22.759
Moses after Moses died according
to our Bible.

00:13:22.759 --> 00:13:26.589
It is in a Jewish document we
call the Assumption of

00:13:26.589 --> 00:13:27.440
Moses.
 

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.548
He's citing a Jewish document
that's not in the Bible that we

00:13:31.548 --> 00:13:35.317
use, and it may be that that's
why the 2 Peter took that

00:13:35.317 --> 00:13:36.548
reference out.
 

00:13:36.548 --> 00:13:38.726
He didn't want the
Assumption of Moses being

00:13:38.726 --> 00:13:39.639
cited in this text.
 

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:45.669
He also, as I said last time,
he cites some Enoch material in

00:13:45.669 --> 00:13:47.580
verses 14 and 15.
 

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.562
It was also about these that
Enoch in the seventh generation

00:13:50.562 --> 00:13:53.017
from Adam prophesied saying,
"See the Lord is coming

00:13:53.017 --> 00:13:54.379
with ten thousands of his Holy
ones."

00:13:54.379 --> 00:13:57.448
What we have now,
literature, under the name of

00:13:57.448 --> 00:13:59.594
Enoch,
which was written probably

00:13:59.594 --> 00:14:02.149
written over a period of a few
centuries,

00:14:02.149 --> 00:14:05.240
was an accumulation of several
different documents,

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.841
but it started being written in
the third century BCE and then

00:14:08.841 --> 00:14:11.500
was added onto in the centuries
after that.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.647
So he cites materials from the
Assumption of Moses and

00:14:14.647 --> 00:14:16.534
Enoch,
which demonstrates that he's

00:14:16.534 --> 00:14:19.414
still living in a time when
what's considered scripture by

00:14:19.414 --> 00:14:22.600
these early followers of Jesus
is still in a state of flux,

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.509
so he's not writing in a time
where the Canon,

00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:27.980
even the Jewish Canon,
the Hebrew Bible Canon,

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.389
has been set yet.
 

00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:34.610
He's also writing in a time
when some of the Eucharistic

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:38.370
practices may also be not like
they were later.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.738
Look at verse 12,
"These are blemishes on

00:14:41.738 --> 00:14:46.529
your love feast [your agapes]
whilst they feast without fear,

00:14:46.529 --> 00:14:48.717
feeding themselves,"
and he goes on and condemns the

00:14:48.717 --> 00:14:49.070
people.
 

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:53.480
These agapes probably refer to
the taking of the Communion,

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.311
The Lord's Supper,
but in the context of a bigger

00:14:56.311 --> 00:14:59.259
meal as we've seen was the case
also in Corinth.

00:14:59.259 --> 00:15:02.014
In 1 Corinthians 11,
Paul talks about them coming

00:15:02.014 --> 00:15:05.640
together and having the meal,
and as part of that meal they

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.100
would have the wine and the
bread of the Lord's Supper.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:13.177
So Jude represents an in
between time in early

00:15:13.177 --> 00:15:16.620
Christianity that's
post-apostolic,

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.870
so it's not of the apostolic
period as Paul's letters are,

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:23.775
Paul's authentic letters,
but it's also not quite to the

00:15:23.775 --> 00:15:28.179
firm ecclesiastical institutions
that now for the rest of today

00:15:28.179 --> 00:15:31.590
and next time I'll talk about
become formed.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:34.864
You don't have here,
at this point yet,

00:15:34.864 --> 00:15:37.793
bishops, set creeds,
set liturgies,

00:15:37.793 --> 00:15:39.690
and set scripture.
 

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:43.009
All of those things will later
be used to settle disputes.

00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:44.058
What did I say?
 

00:15:44.058 --> 00:15:50.120
Bishops, creeds,
liturgy, and scripture.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.139
Those are four things that come
to be used as,

00:15:53.139 --> 00:15:56.220
you might call them,
technologies of unity,

00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:00.231
technologies of control in
bringing unity out of this wild

00:16:00.231 --> 00:16:04.524
diversity of early Christianity
that we've been making a theme

00:16:04.524 --> 00:16:07.129
of this course all along the
way.

00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:10.311
Then the next thing we want to
talk about is the letters of

00:16:10.311 --> 00:16:12.448
Ignatius,
because he then represents

00:16:12.448 --> 00:16:16.793
another stage in this process,
and especially the use of the

00:16:16.793 --> 00:16:19.320
office of the bishop itself.
 

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.509
First, you notice how much
Ignatius makes himself out to be

00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:26.298
this great martyr.
 

00:16:26.298 --> 00:16:30.875
Part of his authority derives
simply from the fact that he's

00:16:30.875 --> 00:16:34.830
been arrested and he's being
taken from Antioch,

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.615
where he was bishop,
to Rome to stand trial and then

00:16:38.615 --> 00:16:39.730
to be killed.
 

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.405
Along the way,
he writes these letters when

00:16:42.405 --> 00:16:46.077
he's going through Asia Minor,
to different cities in Asia

00:16:46.077 --> 00:16:49.269
Minor, sort of like the author
of Revelation had done.

00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:53.769
Notice what he does:
he plays on the idea that he's

00:16:53.769 --> 00:16:58.990
going to die and he makes so
much out of it that it becomes

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:00.970
pretty much gross.
 

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.951
Look, for example,
at the Letter to the

00:17:03.951 --> 00:17:07.369
Romans if you can find it in
your packet.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:15.961
I need to have a Bible song for
Ignatius' letters so we'll know

00:17:15.961 --> 00:17:17.430
where to find them.
 

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:21.960
It's toward the last one.
 

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.009
The Letter to the Romans
from Ignatius.

00:17:24.009 --> 00:17:29.199
Look at chapter 4:
For my part I am writing to all

00:17:29.199 --> 00:17:33.477
the churches and assuring them
that I am truly in earnest about

00:17:33.477 --> 00:17:36.825
dying for God,
if only you yourselves put no

00:17:36.825 --> 00:17:38.348
obstacles in my way.
 

00:17:38.348 --> 00:17:40.844
So he's telling the Romans,
when I'm getting tried and put

00:17:40.844 --> 00:17:42.993
before the beast,
don't you try to intervene and

00:17:42.993 --> 00:17:44.839
save me,
don't try to save me,

00:17:44.839 --> 00:17:45.720
he's saying.
 

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.338
I must implore you to do me no
such untimely kindness.

00:17:49.338 --> 00:17:53.355
Pray, leave me to be a meal for
the beasts, for it is they who

00:17:53.355 --> 00:17:55.200
can provide my way to God.
 

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.842
I am his wheat,
ground fine by the lions'

00:17:57.842 --> 00:18:00.750
teeth, to be made purest bread
for Christ.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.073
Better still,
incite the creatures to become

00:18:03.073 --> 00:18:06.423
a sepulcher for me.[He wants the
lions' bodies to be his tomb.]

00:18:06.423 --> 00:18:09.828
Let them not leave the smallest
scrap of my flesh so that I need

00:18:09.828 --> 00:18:12.640
not be a burden to anyone after
I fall asleep.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.259
[I'll just sleep here in the
dark don't worry about me.]

00:18:15.259 --> 00:18:18.259
When there is no trace of my
body left for the world to see,

00:18:18.259 --> 00:18:21.308
then I shall truly be Jesus
Christ's disciple.

00:18:21.308 --> 00:18:23.488
So intercede with him,
that is with God,

00:18:23.488 --> 00:18:26.170
for me that by their
instrumentality [that is the

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:29.131
instruments of the lions]
I may be made a sacrifice to

00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:29.690
God.
 

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:33.333
However, I am not issuing
orders to you as though I were a

00:18:33.333 --> 00:18:36.209
Peter or a Paul [a little bit of
modesty here]

00:18:36.209 --> 00:18:37.680
they were apostles.
 

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.710
I am just a condemned criminal.
 

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.319
They were free men.
 

00:18:41.319 --> 00:18:43.058
I am still a slave.
 

00:18:43.058 --> 00:18:46.160
Though if I suffer Jesus Christ
will give me liberty and in him

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.910
I shall rise again as a free
man.

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.636
For the present,
these chains are schooling me

00:18:50.636 --> 00:18:52.818
to have done with earthly
desires.

00:18:52.818 --> 00:18:56.943
Look at the next chapter,
chapter 5 and about halfway

00:18:56.943 --> 00:18:57.500
down.
 

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.970
I don't have page numbers here.
 

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:04.298
"How I look forward,"
this becomes almost morbid.

00:19:04.298 --> 00:19:08.392
Modern people reading Ignatius'
letters, and he looks like he's

00:19:08.392 --> 00:19:10.900
morbid in his craving for
martyrdom.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.700
That's how odd it looks to us
modern people.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.942
How I look forward to the real
lions that have been got ready

00:19:17.942 --> 00:19:18.578
for me!
 

00:19:18.578 --> 00:19:21.078
All I pray is that I might find
them swift.

00:19:21.078 --> 00:19:23.048
I am going to make overtures to
them,

00:19:23.048 --> 00:19:25.058
so that unlike some other
wretches,

00:19:25.058 --> 00:19:27.220
whom they have been too
spiritless to touch,

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.160
they may devour me with all
speed.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.578
And if they are still reluctant
I shall use force to them.

00:19:31.578 --> 00:19:35.154
[He's going to pull the lion's
teeth right toward his chest.]

00:19:35.154 --> 00:19:38.730
You must forgive me but I do
know what is best for myself.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.229
This is the first stage of my
discipleship,

00:19:41.229 --> 00:19:43.251
and no power,
visible or invisible,

00:19:43.251 --> 00:19:45.930
must grudge me my coming to
Jesus Christ.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.480
Fire, crosses,
beast fighting,

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.452
hacking,
and quartering,

00:19:50.452 --> 00:19:53.328
splintering of bone and
mangling of limb,

00:19:53.328 --> 00:19:55.990
even the pulverizing of my
entire body,

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:59.029
let every horrid and diabolical
torment come upon me,

00:19:59.029 --> 00:20:02.338
provided only that I can win my
way to Jesus Christ.

00:20:02.338 --> 00:20:04.960
This is martyrology stuff,
folks.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.205
This is the beginning of the
entire cult of the martyrs in

00:20:08.205 --> 00:20:11.566
Christianity that becomes so
important in early Christianity

00:20:11.566 --> 00:20:13.558
and then for hundreds of years.
 

00:20:13.558 --> 00:20:18.223
Now Paul had also talked about
chains, his chains being

00:20:18.223 --> 00:20:20.470
something that was good.
 

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.578
He gloried in his chains and
being in prison.

00:20:23.578 --> 00:20:27.778
Ignatius takes this from Paul
and just runs with it even more.

00:20:27.778 --> 00:20:29.608
In Ephesians,
the eleventh chapter of

00:20:29.608 --> 00:20:31.827
Ephesians,
the letter not of Paul to the

00:20:31.827 --> 00:20:34.470
Ephesians but the letter of
Ignatius to the Ephesians,

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:37.160
he talks about his chains as
pearls.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.372
In the first chapter of this
letter of Ignatius to the

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:43.098
Romans, he talks about the
chains of Jesus.

00:20:43.098 --> 00:20:47.450
Then also, I mentioned that he
sees himself,

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:51.509
in his martyrdom,
as getting closer to Jesus,

00:20:51.509 --> 00:20:54.662
and in this he's becoming
himself--he calls himself in the

00:20:54.662 --> 00:20:57.815
first part of this and the
second chapter of the letter to

00:20:57.815 --> 00:21:00.599
the Romans,
the logos theou.

00:21:00.599 --> 00:21:02.269
What do we know that means?
 

00:21:02.269 --> 00:21:04.260
We've seen this logos
stuff before,

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:04.650
right?
 

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:14.534
Transliterated,
remember what logos

00:21:14.534 --> 00:21:15.390
means?
 

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:17.970
The "word,"
correct, theou,

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:18.868
anybody know?
 

00:21:18.868 --> 00:21:23.271
"Of God":
Ignatius himself is the

00:21:23.271 --> 00:21:24.528
word of God.
 

00:21:24.528 --> 00:21:27.740
This is what the Gospel of John
called Jesus;

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.578
Jesus was the Word of God.
 

00:21:29.578 --> 00:21:32.078
Ignatius can even claim,
for himself,

00:21:32.078 --> 00:21:35.480
the status that he,
especially to his martyrdom is

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.869
the Word of God.
 

00:21:36.869 --> 00:21:38.490
Where does he get all this?
 

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:42.192
Well this is this developing
martryology kind of ideology in

00:21:42.192 --> 00:21:43.009
literature.
 

00:21:43.009 --> 00:21:45.810
The idea was,
in most of early Christianity,

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:49.329
if you're good Christian
people, when you die you won't

00:21:49.329 --> 00:21:51.220
immediately go to heaven.
 

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.650
It's not like popular thinking
about Christian doctrine.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:57.486
True Christian doctrine doesn't
say that you immediately go to

00:21:57.486 --> 00:21:57.811
heaven.
 

00:21:57.811 --> 00:21:58.509
necessarily.
 

00:21:58.509 --> 00:22:00.679
It says that you may be sleep
or do something,

00:22:00.679 --> 00:22:03.380
but you have to wait for the
resurrection of the body.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.156
That's why you confess things
like in the Nicene Creed,

00:22:06.156 --> 00:22:09.345
if you confess the resurrection
of the body or the resurrection

00:22:09.345 --> 00:22:10.220
of the flesh.
 

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.665
That's because,
according to Christian

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:14.538
doctrine,
that's the true afterlife

00:22:14.538 --> 00:22:16.623
experience,
not just the immortal soul

00:22:16.623 --> 00:22:19.038
living forever,
but the resurrection of your

00:22:19.038 --> 00:22:20.558
body, it's a newly made body.
 

00:22:20.558 --> 00:22:22.470
But what happens before the
resurrection?

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.240
Because we all know that comes
at the end of time.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.008
Well, most Christians believed
you slept somewhere,

00:22:27.008 --> 00:22:28.724
or maybe your soul,
your spirit,

00:22:28.724 --> 00:22:30.940
would go to some kind halfway
house.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:35.285
This develops into the notion
of purgatory or some kind of

00:22:35.285 --> 00:22:38.269
Hades-type place,
a place where you would either

00:22:38.269 --> 00:22:40.410
sleep or your soul will go
someplace else,

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:41.720
and you'd wait for the
resurrection.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.531
Well, according to developing
Christian ideas,

00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:47.720
martyrs didn't have to wait for
the resurrection.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.491
Once they were martyred,
as a reward for their

00:22:50.491 --> 00:22:54.003
martyrdom, their spirit goes
straight to heaven to be with

00:22:54.003 --> 00:22:55.358
Jesus immediately.
 

00:22:55.358 --> 00:23:00.388
You bypass some bad waiting
room type experience if you're

00:23:00.388 --> 00:23:01.358
martyred.
 

00:23:01.358 --> 00:23:05.275
This became even so important
that people who were condemned

00:23:05.275 --> 00:23:08.660
to be martyred but then weren't
actually killed,

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.653
for whatever reason,
sometimes people would be

00:23:10.653 --> 00:23:12.872
condemned,
and maybe the beasts weren't

00:23:12.872 --> 00:23:13.868
hungry that day.
 

00:23:13.868 --> 00:23:17.211
After being thrown to the beast
they might be turned loose

00:23:17.211 --> 00:23:18.662
later,
or they might be imprisoned for

00:23:18.662 --> 00:23:20.284
awhile,
or they might have a different

00:23:20.284 --> 00:23:22.767
governor who comes along and
decides to pardon people or

00:23:22.767 --> 00:23:23.490
release them.
 

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:26.997
What do you do with people who
are condemned to martyrdom but

00:23:26.997 --> 00:23:28.400
not actually martyred?
 

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.553
Well, they were very close to
martyrdom so that makes them

00:23:31.553 --> 00:23:32.660
very close to God.
 

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.248
Remember, if martyrs,
right after they die go to

00:23:35.248 --> 00:23:38.634
heaven to be with Christ,
they're right there in heaven,

00:23:38.634 --> 00:23:42.142
and therefore you can kind of
pray to martyrs to intercede

00:23:42.142 --> 00:23:45.279
with God or Christ for you
because they're in heaven

00:23:45.279 --> 00:23:46.078
already.
 

00:23:46.078 --> 00:23:49.518
This idea that martyrs could be
intercessors for living

00:23:49.518 --> 00:23:50.920
Christians develops.
 

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.971
This even carries over to where
if you are condemned to

00:23:53.971 --> 00:23:56.515
martyrdom but you don't actually
get martyred,

00:23:56.515 --> 00:23:58.890
you become what they call a
confessor.

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:03.361
This is because people can
confess to you,

00:24:03.361 --> 00:24:08.269
they can confide in you,
they can help you.

00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:11.133
So even people who are not
actually martyred that have been

00:24:11.133 --> 00:24:13.700
condemned to death at some point
for their faith,

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.165
they attained a certain kind of
closeness to God through that

00:24:17.165 --> 00:24:19.365
activity,
and they gained therefore a

00:24:19.365 --> 00:24:20.868
certain kind of authority.
 

00:24:20.868 --> 00:24:24.288
Now this was not an official
ecclesiastical authority.

00:24:24.288 --> 00:24:29.101
No institution of the church
granted these confessors their

00:24:29.101 --> 00:24:31.153
authority,
but they developed this

00:24:31.153 --> 00:24:33.608
authority because people
respected them and trusted them.

00:24:33.608 --> 00:24:39.375
Confessors became somewhat of
like charismatic authority

00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:42.519
figures in the early church.
 

00:24:42.519 --> 00:24:45.150
Now this caused problems in a
few places.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.420
Because what if you have a
bunch of people going out to see

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:51.690
some monk who's now a confessor
because he was condemned to

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:55.388
martyrdom but then still lived,
and they're asking his opinions

00:24:55.388 --> 00:24:58.170
about,
should I eat meat on Friday?

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:00.819
What days of the week should I
pray on?

00:25:00.819 --> 00:25:02.880
Is it okay to do this?
 

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:03.920
Is it okay to do that?
 

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.785
What if the confessor gives a
different answer from the

00:25:07.785 --> 00:25:08.430
bishop?
 

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:11.108
Well some people might think
the confessor,

00:25:11.108 --> 00:25:14.873
who is closer to God after all,
has more authority even than

00:25:14.873 --> 00:25:15.828
the bishop.
 

00:25:15.828 --> 00:25:17.950
Well, bishops don't like this
of course,

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.858
they consider themselves the
authority in that location,

00:25:20.858 --> 00:25:24.920
and so you get sometimes
problems of who's the greater

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.838
authority?
 

00:25:25.838 --> 00:25:28.079
The confessor,
the martyr type figure,

00:25:28.079 --> 00:25:31.348
or the ecclesiastical official
figure of the bishop?

00:25:31.348 --> 00:25:33.848
Notice what Ignatius does with
this, though.

00:25:33.848 --> 00:25:36.917
He spends a lot of time in his
letters claiming the authority

00:25:36.917 --> 00:25:39.680
of a martyr because he's on his
way to being killed.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.817
He says, don't save me,
I want to be killed as a

00:25:42.817 --> 00:25:43.420
martyr.
 

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:47.265
But Ignatius also is one of the
earliest people we have in

00:25:47.265 --> 00:25:51.176
Christianity who claims great
authority also for himself as

00:25:51.176 --> 00:25:51.920
bishop.
 

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.512
Now he wouldn't necessarily
have authority as a bishop over

00:25:55.512 --> 00:25:58.858
anywhere except the region he
was actually a bishop.

00:25:58.858 --> 00:26:00.009
He wasn't the bishop of the
world;

00:26:00.009 --> 00:26:03.304
he was the bishop of Antioch,
the town in the east where Paul

00:26:03.304 --> 00:26:05.828
and Barnabas spent a good bit of
their time.

00:26:05.828 --> 00:26:08.703
His actual official
ecclesiastical authority as

00:26:08.703 --> 00:26:11.578
bishop was only in Antioch and
its environs.

00:26:11.578 --> 00:26:15.230
He's playing up his martyrology
kind of authority so that he can

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:18.823
exercise a bit of authority even
over these other churches that

00:26:18.823 --> 00:26:20.038
he's writing too.
 

00:26:20.038 --> 00:26:22.858
That gives him a little bit of
a reach of authority.

00:26:22.858 --> 00:26:25.630
Notice what he does then with
all this bishop stuff,

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:29.115
and here we see the beginnings
of the development of the

00:26:29.115 --> 00:26:32.410
Catholic Church structure at
this very early time.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:35.828
This is early because we think
that Ignatius is writing these

00:26:35.828 --> 00:26:37.538
letters around the year 110.
 

00:26:37.538 --> 00:26:41.875
If you have this developing
episcopacy, that's just the

00:26:41.875 --> 00:26:46.934
Greek sort of sounding word for
bishop or bishopric or something

00:26:46.934 --> 00:26:48.058
like that.
 

00:26:48.058 --> 00:26:51.594
If you have this developing
office of the bishops--then

00:26:51.594 --> 00:26:55.390
that's happening at a fairly
early time in Christianity.

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:59.586
Look therefore at the Letter
to the Trallians,

00:26:59.586 --> 00:27:03.784
and its right before the
Letter to the Romans,

00:27:03.784 --> 00:27:05.480
chapters 2 and 3.
 

00:27:08.608 --> 00:27:12.742
Your obedience to your bishop,
as though he were Jesus Christ

00:27:12.742 --> 00:27:15.291
[wow talk about raising the
bishop up]

00:27:15.291 --> 00:27:19.219
shows me plainly enough that
yours is no worldly manner of

00:27:19.219 --> 00:27:22.318
life but that of Jesus Christ
himself,

00:27:22.318 --> 00:27:24.646
who gave his life for us that
faith in his death might save

00:27:24.646 --> 00:27:25.328
you from death.
 

00:27:25.328 --> 00:27:28.074
At the same time however,
it is essential that you should

00:27:28.074 --> 00:27:31.210
never act independently of the
bishop as evidently you do not.

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:34.308
You must also be no less
submissive to your clergy.

00:27:34.308 --> 00:27:35.858
The Greek word here is
literally

00:27:35.858 --> 00:27:37.108
"presbyters."
 

00:27:37.108 --> 00:27:39.298
Remember we've already seen
this word come up,

00:27:39.298 --> 00:27:42.068
which means "elders"
more literally in Greek.

00:27:42.068 --> 00:27:46.035
Now it's starting to be used
for particular kinds of clergy

00:27:46.035 --> 00:27:47.130
in the church.
 

00:27:47.130 --> 00:28:02.878
So we see here the bishop,
presbyters, which will come to

00:28:02.878 --> 00:28:07.660
be priests, ...
 

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.929
and mind them as apostles of
Jesus Christ,

00:28:09.929 --> 00:28:13.138
our hope in whom we shall one
day be found if our lives are

00:28:13.138 --> 00:28:14.079
lived in him.
 

00:28:14.079 --> 00:28:15.778
The deacons, too ...
 

00:28:15.778 --> 00:28:18.160
So now we have this other
office.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.210
We've seen these before, right?
 

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:25.588
We saw presbyters and deacons,
and bishops in a certain sense,

00:28:25.588 --> 00:28:29.863
in the Pastoral Epistles,
but they weren't carefully

00:28:29.863 --> 00:28:34.220
formed into a three-tiered
institution of offices.

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.980
Now we're getting it in
Ignatius.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.828
What will become later basic
church structure,

00:28:40.828 --> 00:28:43.108
that lasts up until the
Reformation,

00:28:43.108 --> 00:28:46.702
will be bishops on top,
appointed to a particular

00:28:46.702 --> 00:28:48.960
location,
so the bishop will be over a

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.000
city and all the churches over
this city.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.219
Then under that will be
priests, who have certain

00:28:54.219 --> 00:28:56.077
duties,
for example administering the

00:28:56.077 --> 00:28:57.726
Eucharist in the mass,
and baptizing,

00:28:57.726 --> 00:29:00.583
and under that will be deacons
who have other kinds of duties

00:29:00.583 --> 00:29:03.182
in church,
and they're in that 1,2,

00:29:03.182 --> 00:29:04.230
3 hierarchy.
 

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:06.157
The deacons,
too, who serve the mysteries of

00:29:06.157 --> 00:29:08.536
Jesus Christ must be men
universally approved in every

00:29:08.536 --> 00:29:09.935
way,
since they are not mere

00:29:09.935 --> 00:29:12.607
dispensers of meat and drink,
but servants of the church of

00:29:12.607 --> 00:29:15.082
God, and therefore under
obligation to guard themselves

00:29:15.082 --> 00:29:17.601
against any slur or imputation
as strictly as they would

00:29:17.601 --> 00:29:18.930
against the fire itself.
 

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:22.588
Equally, [this is paragraph 3]
it is for the rest of you to

00:29:22.588 --> 00:29:25.868
hold deacons in as great respect
as Jesus Christ,

00:29:25.868 --> 00:29:28.923
just as you should look upon
the bishop as a type of the

00:29:28.923 --> 00:29:31.654
Father,
and the clergy as the apostolic

00:29:31.654 --> 00:29:33.618
circle forming his counsel.
 

00:29:33.618 --> 00:29:38.046
Notice what we've got then,
you've got a Trinity,

00:29:38.046 --> 00:29:43.025
almost, of offices that are
matched by something like a

00:29:43.025 --> 00:29:45.700
trinity of these figures.
 

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:50.089
The bishop, is the Father,
the deacons are Jesus Christ,

00:29:50.089 --> 00:29:54.640
and the presbyters--he calls
them an apostolic council.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:58.042
What he's doing is he's
actually setting up these

00:29:58.042 --> 00:30:02.509
offices of the early church to
look kind of like a law court.

00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:07.730
Where you have a judge and you
would have other officials.

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:13.029
So he's imitating Roman
official legal and political

00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:19.472
government structures by having
regional bishops presiding over

00:30:19.472 --> 00:30:25.605
a plurality of priests who then
are also over a plurality of

00:30:25.605 --> 00:30:27.058
deacons.
 

00:30:27.058 --> 00:30:30.772
What makes it really odd is
that he equates Jesus,

00:30:30.772 --> 00:30:34.182
the Father, and Apostles with
deacons, bishop,

00:30:34.182 --> 00:30:35.318
and clergy.
 

00:30:35.318 --> 00:30:41.608
He's giving these men in these
offices a great deal of power.

00:30:41.608 --> 00:30:45.544
In fact, it's giving them way
more power and authority than

00:30:45.544 --> 00:30:49.750
most of us historians think they
actually had at this point.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:53.406
We know from other historical
documents that bishops didn't

00:30:53.406 --> 00:30:55.930
have that much power until much
later.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:58.548
Presbyters didn't have that
much until way later.

00:30:58.548 --> 00:31:03.063
So Ignatius is trying to pump
up what is actually a fairly new

00:31:03.063 --> 00:31:06.910
structure of authority and
institutional structure in

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:07.650
these.
 

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:11.816
He says all the time things
like, don't do anything without

00:31:11.816 --> 00:31:12.750
the bishop.
 

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.445
He talks about,
in the Letter to the

00:31:14.445 --> 00:31:15.846
Magnesians,
paragraph 6,

00:31:15.846 --> 00:31:18.287
he talks about "the
bishop's authority is the

00:31:18.287 --> 00:31:20.130
authority of God the
Father."

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:23.209
He says in Magnesians
paragraph 7, "

00:31:23.209 --> 00:31:27.140
the bishop is to be regarded it
as the Lord Himself."

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.140
What is he doing here?
 

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.190
He's writing these to these
different churches,

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:34.808
and even in fact scriptural
interpretation--

00:31:34.808 --> 00:31:38.230
the main thing about modern
Protestantism is the idea that

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:41.348
every Christian is responsible
only to the reading of

00:31:41.348 --> 00:31:43.328
scripture,
scripture only.

00:31:43.328 --> 00:31:45.518
Your responsibility is to find
the will of God through

00:31:45.518 --> 00:31:47.500
scripture, though the revelation
of scripture.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.000
Ignatius totally disagrees with
that.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.343
He says there should be no
individual interpretation of

00:31:53.343 --> 00:31:55.509
scripture apart from your
bishop.

00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:56.390
Why?
 

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.848
Ignatius knows what we've all
learned ourselves,

00:31:58.848 --> 00:32:00.828
that you make a text mean
anything you want,

00:32:00.828 --> 00:32:02.788
and as we see from
Protestantism,

00:32:02.788 --> 00:32:06.093
fracturing up into a million
different denominations in

00:32:06.093 --> 00:32:08.476
churches,
all claiming to be following

00:32:08.476 --> 00:32:10.962
the Bible,
you can make the Bible say

00:32:10.962 --> 00:32:14.318
whatever you want it to say,
and everybody does.

00:32:14.318 --> 00:32:16.827
So Ignatius also,
he says, you can't even

00:32:16.827 --> 00:32:18.960
interpret scripture on your own.
 

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.900
You have to do that in an
agreement the bishop.

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.910
What have we seen here going on?
 

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:27.593
We see Christianity,
this fledgling movement,

00:32:27.593 --> 00:32:31.068
starting to imitate the
structures of the Roman Empire.

00:32:31.068 --> 00:32:34.221
It's no longer a bunch of
simply house churches that are

00:32:34.221 --> 00:32:37.659
loosely federated by the fact
that they send letters back and

00:32:37.659 --> 00:32:39.852
forth,
and have emissaries between

00:32:39.852 --> 00:32:40.200
them.
 

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.852
It's no longer an authority
structure where Paul simply has

00:32:42.852 --> 00:32:45.643
to exert his authority as much
as he can through his own force

00:32:45.643 --> 00:32:47.608
of will and his charismatic
authority,

00:32:47.608 --> 00:32:50.050
and claim authority as an
apostle, although he doesn't

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:50.650
have paper.
 

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:54.719
Nobody ever gave Paul a diploma
that said, "Paul is now an

00:32:54.719 --> 00:32:55.769
Apostle."
 

00:32:55.769 --> 00:32:58.788
He couldn't refer to his
Princeton Seminary,

00:32:58.788 --> 00:33:02.578
theological seminary diploma to
prove his authority.

00:33:02.578 --> 00:33:05.376
He just had to depend on this
claim that he had that he had

00:33:05.376 --> 00:33:07.885
seen the risen Jesus,
that he had had this revelation

00:33:07.885 --> 00:33:08.608
experience.
 

00:33:08.608 --> 00:33:11.688
We're moving from that kind of
charismatic exercise of

00:33:11.688 --> 00:33:14.940
authority to what is now much
more institutional kinds of

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.088
hierarchy structure of
authority.

00:33:17.088 --> 00:33:21.109
Medieval Christianity would
itself, therefore,

00:33:21.109 --> 00:33:25.400
imitate the structures of
monarchy and empire.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.730
Who elects the Pope?
 

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:31.630
We'll see later that,
in this period,

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:36.142
bishops seem to actually have
been elected by the people,

00:33:36.142 --> 00:33:38.640
at least by the presbyters.
 

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.640
In bishops weren't often
elected.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.780
Bishops in the modern Roman
Catholic Church are not elected

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.838
by the people,
they're appointed by the

00:33:45.838 --> 00:33:46.490
Vatican.
 

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:47.700
Who elects the Pope?
 

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:48.608
Well the cardinals.
 

00:33:48.608 --> 00:33:52.109
So if the Pope is elected,
but by only a limited number of

00:33:52.109 --> 00:33:55.980
men, old men who themselves were
appointed by previous Popes.

00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:00.074
This is not a democratic system
that the Roman Catholic Church

00:34:00.074 --> 00:34:01.349
is structured on.
 

00:34:01.349 --> 00:34:02.588
What is it structured on?
 

00:34:02.588 --> 00:34:07.538
It's structured on monarchical
and imperial ideas of politics.

00:34:07.538 --> 00:34:09.309
The-- in the ancient world,
in the Middle Ages,

00:34:09.309 --> 00:34:12.617
so you have an emperor and you
have a pope and they come to

00:34:12.617 --> 00:34:15.239
hold their power in remarkably
similar ways.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:18.219
They each have a court,
the emperor or the king has a

00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:21.541
court of officials with knights
and that sort of thing that

00:34:21.541 --> 00:34:23.719
advise him and carry out his
will.

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:27.179
The Pope has a house with
cardinals and bishops.

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:31.699
The Reformation comes along and
things change.

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:34.041
The Reformers,
of course, sort of claim that

00:34:34.041 --> 00:34:37.255
what they were doing was simply
getting back to the biblical

00:34:37.255 --> 00:34:37.800
model.
 

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.929
That's not really right.
 

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:41.833
What they were doing was
reflecting what was a rising

00:34:41.833 --> 00:34:45.181
bourgeoisie form that was at
least a bit more like Republican

00:34:45.181 --> 00:34:47.360
or Democratic political
structures.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.521
Protestant churches have their
different kinds of ways of

00:34:50.521 --> 00:34:53.259
structuring themselves,
which are not free from

00:34:53.259 --> 00:34:56.690
political influence either,
they just represent the early

00:34:56.690 --> 00:35:00.413
modern political structures that
arose as the bourgeoisie in

00:35:00.413 --> 00:35:04.262
Europe developed more and more
power and took more powers onto

00:35:04.262 --> 00:35:05.018
itself.
 

00:35:05.018 --> 00:35:07.949
The growth of a mercantile
middle class,

00:35:07.949 --> 00:35:11.250
and the decline of the
aristocracy in Europe,

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:15.559
led to more Democratic
tendencies, first in towns,

00:35:15.559 --> 00:35:17.469
and then in countries overall.
 

00:35:17.469 --> 00:35:19.730
It led to Republicanism.
 

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:23.748
The Dutch were the first to
completely get rid of kings and

00:35:23.748 --> 00:35:25.480
have a modern republic.
 

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:29.760
And then of course the United
States becomes the most famous

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.590
of modern republics in the
beginning.

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:36.119
In place of having the king or
the emperor in control,

00:35:36.119 --> 00:35:39.449
you're supposed to have
constitutional controls.

00:35:39.449 --> 00:35:42.695
Things that bodies of people
come together to make laws and

00:35:42.695 --> 00:35:44.654
constitutions,
and then you use that

00:35:44.654 --> 00:35:47.340
constitutional control to bring
about unity.

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:49.762
Now of course,
as we've seen in our own modern

00:35:49.762 --> 00:35:52.103
politics,
you can't always depend upon

00:35:52.103 --> 00:35:55.429
the constitutions to protect you
from certain rulers,

00:35:55.429 --> 00:35:59.349
but that's the ideal reflecting
a modern movement.

00:35:59.349 --> 00:36:03.001
That's one of the ways that you
see how Christianity both comes

00:36:03.001 --> 00:36:05.998
out in the ancient world,
changes in the medieval period

00:36:05.998 --> 00:36:08.289
and then changes again in the
early modern period.

00:36:08.289 --> 00:36:11.032
It's reflecting the changes
that are going on also in

00:36:11.032 --> 00:36:13.724
politics in society,
which we of course shouldn't be

00:36:13.724 --> 00:36:14.780
surprised about.
 

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:19.139
The other thing that we can see
developing too is,

00:36:19.139 --> 00:36:20.429
and we see this more from the
Didache,

00:36:20.429 --> 00:36:22.090
the other document I asked you
to read today,

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:26.440
the shift toward trying to
control things like liturgy.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:31.927
The Didache is simply a
Greek work meaning "the

00:36:31.927 --> 00:36:36.186
teaching,"
because this document purports

00:36:36.186 --> 00:36:40.539
to be the teaching of the twelve
apostles.

00:36:40.539 --> 00:36:42.760
Now it wasn't actually written
by the twelve apostles.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.929
It was written much later.
 

00:36:43.929 --> 00:36:46.061
It may have been written around
the same time as the letters of

00:36:46.061 --> 00:36:46.440
Ignatius.
 

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:49.248
Most people place it around the
turn of the first century,

00:36:49.248 --> 00:36:51.809
so around the year 100 or a
little bit after that.

00:36:51.809 --> 00:36:53.672
It's called,
The Teaching of the Twelve

00:36:53.672 --> 00:36:56.309
Apostles,
and it's the first time we get

00:36:56.309 --> 00:36:59.684
in Christian literature
something like a manual on how

00:36:59.684 --> 00:37:00.449
to do it.
 

00:37:00.449 --> 00:37:02.219
Here's how you're supposed to
do worship service,

00:37:02.219 --> 00:37:04.449
here's how you're supposed to
do a baptism,

00:37:04.449 --> 00:37:06.050
here's how you're supposed to
do the Eucharist to the mass.

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:08.119
Here's what authority
structures you have.

00:37:08.119 --> 00:37:13.166
It was discovered in 1873,
so really it's a very modern

00:37:13.166 --> 00:37:17.840
discovery, didn't exist from the
ancient period.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.615
As far as we know,
it was discovered in a

00:37:20.615 --> 00:37:23.739
monastery in Istanbul,
Constantinople that is,

00:37:23.739 --> 00:37:24.920
now Istanbul.
 

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:30.806
The importance of the discovery
of this document is hard to

00:37:30.806 --> 00:37:35.070
overestimate because it's just a
great,

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:38.958
great document for seeing how
early Christians actually

00:37:38.958 --> 00:37:40.829
practiced their liturgy.
 

00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:44.670
It's very dependent upon the
Gospel of Matthew and the letter

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.719
of James in the New Testament.
 

00:37:46.719 --> 00:37:50.114
It shows a lot of things like
that, it's also dependent upon

00:37:50.114 --> 00:37:53.510
certain Greek philosophical and
Hellenistic Jewish ideas.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:55.309
Now let's just look at some of
the things it says.

00:37:55.309 --> 00:38:01.550
Look on chapter 7 of the
Didache.

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:06.186
We get hints about how early
Christians did baptisms from

00:38:06.186 --> 00:38:07.760
different places.
 

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.280
We think most of the time that
baptism,

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.050
in the earliest period,
was not sprinkling the water or

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:14.000
dipping a little water on
somebody,

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.909
but putting people all the way
under the water.

00:38:15.909 --> 00:38:19.570
We also get hints maybe that
they had people do it at night,

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:21.679
and they had people do it
naked.

00:38:21.679 --> 00:38:24.052
So you took off your clothes,
you went down into the water,

00:38:24.052 --> 00:38:25.280
you were baptized,
you came up,

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.530
and they put a white robe or
something else on you.

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:30.324
We have a few hints about this,
but this is the earliest

00:38:30.324 --> 00:38:33.219
docuemnt we have with anything
like these instructions.

00:38:33.219 --> 00:38:36.429
It says now about baptism:
"This is how to baptize.

00:38:36.429 --> 00:38:38.789
Give public instruction on all
these points,

00:38:38.789 --> 00:38:41.260
and then baptize in running
water...."

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.780
Notice, it actually says
"living water"

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:45.612
in the Greek,
but what it means is,

00:38:45.612 --> 00:38:48.119
try to baptize in a river or
something that has actual

00:38:48.119 --> 00:38:50.059
running water and not in still
water,

00:38:50.059 --> 00:38:50.768
if you can....
 

00:38:50.768 --> 00:38:52.579
in the name of the Father,
and of the Son,

00:38:52.579 --> 00:38:53.550
and the Holy Spirit.
 

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:56.523
[so you have Trinitarian
formula as part of the baptism]

00:38:56.523 --> 00:38:59.659
If you do not have running
water, baptize in some other.

00:38:59.659 --> 00:39:02.335
If you cannot in cold,
then in warm [so they had to be

00:39:02.335 --> 00:39:03.650
baptized in cold water].
 

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:07.175
Before the baptism moreover,
the one who baptizes and the

00:39:07.175 --> 00:39:10.746
one being baptized must fast,
[so you have fasting ahead of

00:39:10.746 --> 00:39:12.409
time]
and any others who can,

00:39:12.409 --> 00:39:14.666
and you must tell the one being
baptized to fast for one or two

00:39:14.666 --> 00:39:15.139
beforehand.
 

00:39:15.139 --> 00:39:18.230
Then he goes into fasting,
here's how you're supposed to

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.679
fast:
 

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:31.920
Your fast must not be identical
with those of the hypocrites.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.297
They fast on Mondays and
Thursdays but he should fast on

00:39:34.297 --> 00:39:35.380
Wednesdays and Fridays.
 

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.739
Who are the hypocrites?
 

00:39:36.739 --> 00:39:37.989
Probably Jews.
 

00:39:37.989 --> 00:39:40.820
He's probably trying to say,
I don't want you Christians to

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:43.748
fast in the same fast days of
the weeks that Jews are fasting

00:39:43.748 --> 00:39:45.672
on,
so he gives them other days to

00:39:45.672 --> 00:39:45.980
fast.
 

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.043
Notice what he says:
he gives the Lord's Prayer,

00:39:48.043 --> 00:39:49.889
which is familiar to most
modern people.

00:39:49.889 --> 00:39:52.360
Our Father in heaven,
hallowed by your name.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.411
Your kingdom come,
you will be done on Earth as it

00:39:54.411 --> 00:39:55.039
is in heaven.
 

00:39:55.039 --> 00:39:56.909
Give us today our bread for the
tomorrow.

00:39:56.909 --> 00:39:58.800
Forgive us our debts as we
forgive our debtors.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.110
Do not lead us into temptation
but save us from the evil one,

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:02.920
for yours is the power and the
glory forever.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.208
That sounds a lot like the
Lord's Prayer that you yourself

00:40:06.208 --> 00:40:09.150
may often say in church if you
ever go to church.

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:11.956
If you notice carefully,
this prayer is actually

00:40:11.956 --> 00:40:15.420
more like what most
modern Christians pray in church

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:19.003
than is either the version of
the Lord's Prayer in Matthew or

00:40:19.003 --> 00:40:19.659
Luke.
 

00:40:19.659 --> 00:40:22.880
In other words,
he's closer to what we actually

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:26.659
pray today than either the
prayer version in Matthew or

00:40:26.659 --> 00:40:28.280
Luke,
which is a very interesting

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.498
fact in itself,
that our prayer comes more from

00:40:30.498 --> 00:40:32.146
a tradition,
it's closer to the

00:40:32.146 --> 00:40:34.210
Didache,
than it is to the Bible.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:37.909
Notice that he gives them
instructions on the Eucharist.

00:40:37.909 --> 00:40:40.391
One of the interesting things
is if you go to a church

00:40:40.391 --> 00:40:43.201
nowadays, usually what they do
is, they bless the bread first

00:40:43.201 --> 00:40:44.559
and then the cup of wine.
 

00:40:44.559 --> 00:40:46.030
He actually has it the other
way around.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:48.570
He says, you give the cup first
and then the bread.

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:51.690
You have, first,
prayers of thanksgiving,

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:56.061
and it's this word thanksgiving
that we actually get the term

00:40:56.061 --> 00:40:59.704
"Eucharist,"
and that just comes from the

00:40:59.704 --> 00:41:02.619
Greek word
"thanksgiving."

00:41:02.619 --> 00:41:05.909
If you go to different
Christian denominations,

00:41:05.909 --> 00:41:08.199
they'll call this differently.
 

00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:09.980
Some places call it the Lord's
Supper,

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:12.460
some people call it just the
Communion,

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:15.440
and if you--some churches,
especially Episcopal churches,

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.110
will call it the Eucharist.
 

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:18.972
Catholic Churches,
they usually call it the Mass,

00:41:18.972 --> 00:41:21.028
but they're all referring
basically to the same thing,

00:41:21.028 --> 00:41:22.659
the sharing of the bread and
the wine.

00:41:22.659 --> 00:41:24.630
He gives instructions on that.
 

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:28.536
Notice it says the Eucharist is
to be restricted to only

00:41:28.536 --> 00:41:30.099
baptized Christians.
 

00:41:30.099 --> 00:41:32.998
You don't give the bread and
win to people who are not

00:41:32.998 --> 00:41:33.599
baptized.
 

00:41:33.599 --> 00:41:36.983
Then he gives some prescribed
prayers in chapter 10,

00:41:36.983 --> 00:41:38.510
and it's interesting.
 

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:41.311
Now we're not in a time where
people are just allowed to pray

00:41:41.311 --> 00:41:43.693
any old way they want too,
he actually gives written

00:41:43.693 --> 00:41:45.469
prayers that he wants them to
use.

00:41:45.469 --> 00:41:47.963
Again, don't exaggerate this
guy's control,

00:41:47.963 --> 00:41:49.449
whoever's writing this.
 

00:41:49.449 --> 00:41:52.456
We don't believe that this
document was actually

00:41:52.456 --> 00:41:55.909
controlling behavior of all
Christians of this time.

00:41:55.909 --> 00:41:59.757
He's trying to bring about some
unity and conformity in a time

00:41:59.757 --> 00:42:03.416
when, we historians assume,
there was a still a huge amount

00:42:03.416 --> 00:42:04.489
of diversity.
 

00:42:04.489 --> 00:42:08.175
By publishing this document and
telling people even how to pray

00:42:08.175 --> 00:42:11.030
he's trying to bring about this
kind of unity.

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:13.166
In chapter 14,
it's interesting because he's

00:42:13.166 --> 00:42:16.146
give the different events that
would take place on the Lord's

00:42:16.146 --> 00:42:17.340
Day, that is Sunday.
 

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:18.525
For example,
you're supposed to have

00:42:18.525 --> 00:42:20.192
confession,
you confess your sins,

00:42:20.192 --> 00:42:23.389
you're supposed to reconcile
with anybody that you're not in

00:42:23.389 --> 00:42:25.496
agreement with,
and then you have the

00:42:25.496 --> 00:42:27.960
Eucharist, which he talks about
as a sacrifice.

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.731
Paul had never talked about
sort of The Lord's Supper as

00:42:31.731 --> 00:42:34.199
being something alike a
sacrifice.

00:42:34.199 --> 00:42:38.485
In later Christianity it will
be considered something like a

00:42:38.485 --> 00:42:41.083
sacrifice,
and so that's why you can only

00:42:41.083 --> 00:42:44.335
have a priest do it because it
actually changes the elements

00:42:44.335 --> 00:42:46.539
and something real is going on
there.

00:42:46.539 --> 00:42:49.695
The Eucharist has by this time
started becoming considered

00:42:49.695 --> 00:42:52.963
something like a sacrifice for
Christians who don't have any

00:42:52.963 --> 00:42:56.047
other form of sacrifice,
because Christians don't go

00:42:56.047 --> 00:42:58.400
around sacrificing lambs or
anything else.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:02.048
Then you have different
leaders, he has in chapter 11

00:43:02.048 --> 00:43:05.137
roles for apostles,
and he also has roles for

00:43:05.137 --> 00:43:06.050
prophets.
 

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.891
Notice what he said in chapter
11, and I think is really

00:43:07.891 --> 00:43:08.360
interesting.
 

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:12.806
This is a time when there seems
to be regular sorts of officers,

00:43:12.806 --> 00:43:16.760
but then there are these
non-sort of regular officers.

00:43:30.909 --> 00:43:33.663
Now about the apostles and
prophets, act in line with the

00:43:33.663 --> 00:43:34.500
gospel precept.
 

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.369
Welcome every apostle on
arriving as if he were the Lord.

00:43:37.369 --> 00:43:40.389
But he must not stay beyond one
day;

00:43:40.389 --> 00:43:42.539
in case of necessity,
however, the next day too.

00:43:42.539 --> 00:43:44.480
If he stays three days he is a
false prophet.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.726
On departing,
an apostle must not accept

00:43:46.726 --> 00:43:50.007
anything, save sufficient food
to carry him until his next

00:43:50.007 --> 00:43:50.699
lodging.
 

00:43:50.699 --> 00:43:53.079
If he asks for money he is a
false prophet.

00:43:53.079 --> 00:43:55.750
So he's kind of mixing these
words--apostle and prophet.

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:57.711
Remember "apostle"
just means "one who is

00:43:57.711 --> 00:43:58.639
sent out"
in Greek.

00:43:58.639 --> 00:44:01.264
What he's talking about are
roving prophets who go around to

00:44:01.264 --> 00:44:02.199
different churches.
 

00:44:02.199 --> 00:44:03.599
And it's really interesting.
 

00:44:03.599 --> 00:44:06.280
He says, let him stay with you
two or three days.

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:09.030
If he's going to stay longer
than that he's going to have to

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:10.429
start working for his bread.
 

00:44:10.429 --> 00:44:13.989
And if you have a prophet who
says, I'm getting a message,

00:44:13.989 --> 00:44:17.297
I'm getting a message,
oh yeah you're supposed to give

00:44:17.297 --> 00:44:18.860
me $5, Jesus says so.
 

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:23.050
Then you know he's a false
prophet and you kick him out.

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:25.409
It's a nice way to figure out
which are genuine prophets and

00:44:25.409 --> 00:44:26.489
which are false prophets.
 

00:44:26.489 --> 00:44:29.681
If this were followed in most
modern Christianity,

00:44:29.681 --> 00:44:32.940
it would have a lot of false
prophets not on TV.

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:36.815
Unfortunately it doesn't work
in modern Christianity,

00:44:36.815 --> 00:44:40.989
so we have a lot of false
prophets on TV asking for a lot

00:44:40.989 --> 00:44:41.960
of money.
 

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:47.447
There's also in chapter 12,
this is not just true for

00:44:47.447 --> 00:44:48.610
prophets.
 

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:51.090
He talks about how to treat
other travelers.

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:53.824
The churches are becoming
something almost like hotels,

00:44:53.824 --> 00:44:56.152
which makes sense,
because in the ancient world

00:44:56.152 --> 00:44:58.230
there aren't really very many
hotels.

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:01.177
You couldn't just check in at
the Motel 6 or the Holiday Inn,

00:45:01.177 --> 00:45:02.699
when you're traveling around.
 

00:45:02.699 --> 00:45:03.900
You have to stay with friends.
 

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.679
There are a few taverns,
yes, some brothels,

00:45:06.679 --> 00:45:08.489
but they're not very safe.
 

00:45:08.489 --> 00:45:11.398
In fact they're very unsafe,
and they're not respectable

00:45:11.398 --> 00:45:13.250
places for a good person to
stay.

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:15.219
They're houses of ill repute.
 

00:45:15.219 --> 00:45:17.889
And so what do you do if you're
good respectable Christian and

00:45:17.889 --> 00:45:20.385
you want all your other fellow
Christians to know that you

00:45:20.385 --> 00:45:22.838
haven't been sleeping around
when you're on your business

00:45:22.838 --> 00:45:23.320
trip?
 

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.516
Well, you have to either stay
with friends or,

00:45:25.516 --> 00:45:27.909
now increasingly,
you can stay with the church.

00:45:27.909 --> 00:45:30.030
But, he says,
if you have these travelers who

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:32.969
come in and they want to stay
more than two or three days,

00:45:32.969 --> 00:45:34.969
then they have to get a job,
and they have to start

00:45:34.969 --> 00:45:35.929
supporting themselves.
 

00:45:35.929 --> 00:45:39.465
You see him developing this
church as a networked

00:45:39.465 --> 00:45:40.570
organization.
 

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:43.279
Again, we have more and more
organization coming into play

00:45:43.279 --> 00:45:46.500
here,
that has defined offices and

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:50.760
some others that aren't so well
defined,

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.679
like these traveling prophets
which he's trying to regularize.

00:45:53.679 --> 00:45:57.793
He's trying to give rules for
an institution of the prophet,

00:45:57.793 --> 00:46:01.976
because that itself is not an
institutional kind of office in

00:46:01.976 --> 00:46:03.579
early Christianity.
 

00:46:03.579 --> 00:46:08.030
So, with Ignatius and with the
Didache,

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:12.309
we have moved a long way from
this tiny little band of

00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:16.507
followers of a Jewish
apocalyptic prophet named Jesus

00:46:16.507 --> 00:46:17.800
of Nazareth.
 

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:22.447
In fact, we've even moved a
good ways away from the informal

00:46:22.447 --> 00:46:26.860
charismatic kind of house
churches planted by the apostle

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:27.570
Paul.
 

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:30.190
We're now seeing the
institution.

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:35.289
We've not yet arrived at what
will become Christianity.

00:46:35.289 --> 00:46:39.079
That is, with all the trappings
of late antiquity,

00:46:39.079 --> 00:46:43.159
full church structures,
creeds, doctrines,

00:46:43.159 --> 00:46:44.762
social networks,
monasticism,

00:46:44.762 --> 00:46:48.199
this will be a big thing that
starts developing especially in

00:46:48.199 --> 00:46:50.307
the third,
fourth, and fifth centuries,

00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:52.715
the rise of monasticism as
another form of Christianity

00:46:52.715 --> 00:46:55.434
that provides a very important
structure for it that will last

00:46:55.434 --> 00:46:57.440
all the way through the medieval
period.

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.849
We don't have that yet.
 

00:46:58.849 --> 00:47:02.000
We don't have a Canon yet.
 

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.751
We don't have a Canon even of
the Old Testament,

00:47:03.751 --> 00:47:05.130
much less of the New Testament
yet.

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:07.992
We see developing in the
letters of Ignatius and in the

00:47:07.992 --> 00:47:11.224
Didache the beginnings of
this later development and to

00:47:11.224 --> 00:47:13.768
what will become a more mature
Christianity.

00:47:13.768 --> 00:47:17.869
The move from that late antique
Christianity though,

00:47:17.869 --> 00:47:20.514
say, to the Christianity of the
fourth century when we get the

00:47:20.514 --> 00:47:22.313
major creeds,
like the Nicene Creed,

00:47:22.313 --> 00:47:25.121
and the Creed of Chalcedon,
to modern Christianity,

00:47:25.121 --> 00:47:28.293
and it being what we call a
"world religion,"

00:47:28.293 --> 00:47:30.349
is itself centuries away
though.

00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:34.460
I'll talk about that next time.
 

00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:38.001
What we've done this whole
semester is barely scratch the

00:47:38.001 --> 00:47:41.480
surface of what would be the
history of Christianity.

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:44.980
The main point of the
scratching has been to get you

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:47.103
to see that,
at the very beginning,

00:47:47.103 --> 00:47:49.940
the first one hundred years of
this Christian movement--

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:51.440
because that's basically all
we've covered,

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:54.043
and not all that either,
but the basic first one hundred

00:47:54.043 --> 00:47:56.302
years--
this was not anything like the

00:47:56.302 --> 00:47:57.768
religion it came to be.
 

00:47:57.768 --> 00:48:00.545
It was diverse,
it was widely different across

00:48:00.545 --> 00:48:03.076
geographic areas,
it had lots of different

00:48:03.076 --> 00:48:03.940
doctrines.
 

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:08.309
There wasn't anything called
orthodoxy yet and heresy yet.

00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:09.590
That all develops later.
 

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:11.349
This is the very beginnings of
it.

00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:14.590
Any questions,
comments, or outbursts?

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:17.969
Okay I'll see you next time.
 

00:48:17.969 --> 00:48:21.867
We will also hand out the final
paper instructions next time in

00:48:21.867 --> 00:48:22.369
class.

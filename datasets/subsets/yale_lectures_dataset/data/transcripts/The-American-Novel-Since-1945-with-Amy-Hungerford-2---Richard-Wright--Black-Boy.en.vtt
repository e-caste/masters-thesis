00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.245
Professor Amy
Hungerford: I just want to

00:00:05.245 --> 00:00:08.740
recap what I talked about last
time very briefly.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.269
I made the point in the first
lecture that American literature

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.204
in the middle of the twentieth
century is particularly

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:20.990
preoccupied with the
relationship between the writer

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.048
and the reader,
between imagination and lived

00:00:25.048 --> 00:00:30.216
experience, between fiction and
truth, between the reader and

00:00:30.216 --> 00:00:34.602
the text,
that these are very vexed and

00:00:34.602 --> 00:00:38.880
contested interfaces at this
period.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:46.237
I also made the argument that
at this moment literary art is

00:00:46.237 --> 00:00:53.845
struggling with what to do with
the legacy of modernism in the

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:58.419
early century,
but there's another strain from

00:00:58.419 --> 00:01:01.574
the early century that
matters--and matters

00:01:01.574 --> 00:01:05.707
particularly to Richard
Wright--and that is the American

00:01:05.707 --> 00:01:09.989
strain of naturalism:
writers like Theodore Dreiser.

00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:14.700
Wright is writing very much in
the vein of those writers.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.495
So even though he's very
closely connected to the legacy

00:01:19.495 --> 00:01:24.391
of avant-garde modernism,
he's also connected to a social

00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:27.590
realist strain,
the naturalist strain.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.137
Those are two slightly
different things which I won't

00:01:31.137 --> 00:01:34.980
go in to right now.
He's connected to both those

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.510
strains as well as the modernist
strain.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.393
So what I want to do today
is look closely first at the

00:01:43.393 --> 00:01:48.445
selections from Black Boy
that I asked you to read and

00:01:48.445 --> 00:01:53.329
to look at those as a text and
to ask ourselves what we can

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.950
learn about what kind of story
it is.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.120
And I said about that problem:
Is it autobiography?

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.439
Is it fiction?
What's it trying to do?

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.939
What kind of reader does it
want?

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.080
I suggested that there was a
critical response to those

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.840
issues that was somewhat
negative,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.375
and I want to sort of remind
you of that just by reading you

00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:19.694
a little bit from W.
E.

00:02:19.694 --> 00:02:21.492
B.
Du Bois's review of Black

00:02:21.492 --> 00:02:25.635
Boy when it came out.
I think this sums up nicely

00:02:25.635 --> 00:02:28.970
what I was trying to communicate
last time.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.735
He says, "This book tells a
harsh and forbidding story and

00:02:33.735 --> 00:02:38.919
makes one wonder just exactly
what its relation to truth is.

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:43.051
The title, 'A Record of
Childhood and Youth' "--that was

00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:47.032
the subtitle--"makes one first
think that the story is

00:02:47.032 --> 00:02:50.563
autobiographical.
It probably is at least in

00:02:50.563 --> 00:02:54.771
part, but mainly it is probably
intended to be fiction or

00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:57.710
fictionalized biography.
At any rate,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.956
the reader must regard it as
creative writing rather than

00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:05.343
simply a record of life."
So that's W.

00:03:05.343 --> 00:03:05.659
E.
B.

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.555
Du Bois, and I'm going to take
his advice and now begin to read

00:03:10.555 --> 00:03:14.030
this book with you as creative
writing.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.689
So let's see what it says to us
when we look at it that way.

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:21.108
I'm going to read passages
quite a bit today,

00:03:21.108 --> 00:03:25.847
since some of you may not have
been able to get the RIS packet

00:03:25.847 --> 00:03:28.800
in time, it being shopping
period.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.400
So I'm going to read passages,
and I hope you'll jump around

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.340
with me if you have the text in
your hand.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.510
In general, you should always
bring the book to class.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.225
This is on page 267.
This is from that second half

00:03:42.225 --> 00:03:46.400
of the book that was not
published originally,

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.481
but I want to point to it first
of all in raising the question:

00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:57.484
What did we lose in
understanding this as a literary

00:03:57.484 --> 00:04:01.800
object when the second half of
the book.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.260
You can come in and sit down if
you want;

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.527
there's some space down here.
What did we lose in our

00:04:10.527 --> 00:04:14.922
understanding of it as a
literary object when the second

00:04:14.922 --> 00:04:19.720
half was not published?
There are some seats here

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.854
too.On 267,
this is in one of these

00:04:23.854 --> 00:04:30.600
parenthetical passages where the
narrator is commenting on what

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.040
he's just given account of in
his experience.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.759
"Slowly I began to forge in the
depths of my mind"--this is the

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:43.120
very top of the page--"a
mechanism that repressed all the

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.000
dreams and desires that the
Chicago streets,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.930
the newspapers,
the movies were evoking in me.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.759
I was going through a second
childhood.

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:59.180
A new sense of the limit of the
possible was being born in me."

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.959
What Wright gives us here is an
account of the two parts of this

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:11.878
story that says this is an
account of not one childhood,

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:15.800
but two.
So one thing that readers lost,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.620
when they lost the second half
of this book,

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.166
is the sense that maturing,
the process of maturing,

00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:28.980
was more than just the process
of leaving the South.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.357
That has a typical
Bildungsroman structure,

00:05:33.357 --> 00:05:39.818
the structure of a story about
a boy who goes out from his home

00:05:39.818 --> 00:05:45.029
and sort of becomes a man
through his travels.

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:48.557
If you just have the first
half, you think that that

00:05:48.557 --> 00:05:52.708
development is accomplished when
Richard decides to leave the

00:05:52.708 --> 00:05:57.035
South.
But what he tells us very early

00:05:57.035 --> 00:06:03.132
in part two is that no,
it takes two childhoods for a

00:06:03.132 --> 00:06:09.138
black man to make that journey.
So what is that journey,

00:06:09.138 --> 00:06:12.599
then, that required two
childhoods to accomplish,

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:17.069
a childhood in the South and
then a childhood in the North?

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:24.899
So now I want to turn to the
beginning of the book on page 7.

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:28.451
I'm also going to do some
summarizing of these scenes for

00:06:28.451 --> 00:06:31.550
people who haven't read.
Make yourselves as comfortable

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.130
as you can.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.461
As I mentioned last time,
in the first scene of this book

00:06:39.461 --> 00:06:43.783
the child Richard burns down his
family's house playing with

00:06:43.783 --> 00:06:48.451
matches underneath the curtains.
He goes and hides under the

00:06:48.451 --> 00:06:52.589
house, afraid of the beating his
mother will give him,

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:56.259
and indeed when his mother
finally finds him he is beaten

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:59.862
unconscious, and he is feverish
and sick for a long time

00:06:59.862 --> 00:07:02.621
afterward.
And what I want to read to you

00:07:02.621 --> 00:07:04.340
is this passage on page 7:

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.769
I was lost in a fog of
fear.

00:07:11.769 --> 00:07:15.755
A doctor was called--I was
afterwards told--and he ordered

00:07:15.755 --> 00:07:18.622
that I be kept abed,
that I be kept quiet,

00:07:18.622 --> 00:07:21.350
that my very life depended upon
it.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.810
My body seemed on fire and I
could not sleep.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:28.899
Packs of ice were put on my
forehead to keep down the fever.

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:31.995
Whenever I tried to sleep I
would see huge,

00:07:31.995 --> 00:07:35.532
wobbly, white bags,
like the full udders of cows,

00:07:35.532 --> 00:07:38.480
suspended from the ceiling
above me.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.378
Later, as I grew worse,
I could see the bags in the

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:44.798
daytime with my eyes open and I
was gripped by the fear that

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:47.986
they were going to fall and
drench me with some horrible

00:07:47.986 --> 00:07:50.341
liquid.
Day and night I begged my

00:07:50.341 --> 00:07:53.991
mother and father to take the
bags away, pointing to them,

00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:57.449
shaking with terror because no
one saw them but me.

00:07:57.449 --> 00:08:00.783
Exhaustion would make me drift
toward sleep and then I would

00:08:00.783 --> 00:08:02.930
scream until I was wide awake
again.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.917
I was afraid to sleep.
Time finally bore me away from

00:08:06.917 --> 00:08:09.399
the dangerous bags and I got
well.

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:13.916
But for a long time I was
chastened whenever I remembered

00:08:13.916 --> 00:08:18.110
that my mother had come close to
killing me.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.623
Why start with this scene?
I said last time that part of

00:08:21.623 --> 00:08:23.790
the art of autobiography is
choosing.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.520
What do you choose out of your
life?

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.600
Where do you begin?
Where do you end?

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.982
What do you put next to what?
Why does Wright choose this

00:08:32.982 --> 00:08:34.882
scene?
It's very dramatic,

00:08:34.882 --> 00:08:39.379
so it has that going for it.
It's a hook.

00:08:39.379 --> 00:08:45.124
I would suggest that this
little passage I just read to

00:08:45.124 --> 00:08:48.210
you tells us,
in part, why.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:54.876
It's a moment when a child
realizes that the person who

00:08:54.876 --> 00:09:01.279
gave him life can revoke it.
His mother, who gave him life,

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:04.340
can take that life away from
him.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:08.332
It's a profound sense of
jeopardy--physical,

00:09:08.332 --> 00:09:13.066
mortal jeopardy--and I want to
point to those "huge,

00:09:13.066 --> 00:09:18.080
wobbly, white bags,
like the full udders of cows."

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:23.558
One of the wonderful things
you can see in the Beinecke's

00:09:23.558 --> 00:09:29.220
Richard Wright Archives is the
draft copies of Black Boy.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:34.330
Wright revised this image
in those drafts.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:40.118
It was at one time white faces,
not white bags:

00:09:40.118 --> 00:09:44.777
white faces.
This to me is a fascinating

00:09:44.777 --> 00:09:47.220
revision.
First of all,

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:52.599
it suggests of course that he
was giving language to

00:09:52.599 --> 00:09:56.276
something,
making a specific image out of

00:09:56.276 --> 00:10:00.659
something, that didn't quite
have that specific content in

00:10:00.659 --> 00:10:06.663
his experience as a child.
But that revision is also away

00:10:06.663 --> 00:10:14.840
from a sense that this jeopardy
is represented by a racial face,

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:21.205
the symbolic face of black
oppression, the white face that

00:10:21.205 --> 00:10:28.129
is always cruelly set against
the black boy of this account.

00:10:28.129 --> 00:10:33.724
He revises it away from that to
the more generalized,

00:10:33.724 --> 00:10:38.134
fundamental,
but also very personal figure

00:10:38.134 --> 00:10:43.059
of the mother and the maternal.
So the white bags,

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:47.647
this is an image of the breast.
We have this fear of the

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:53.122
horrible white liquid,
as if milk were going to drown

00:10:53.122 --> 00:10:56.717
him.
So the threat embodied by the

00:10:56.717 --> 00:11:02.925
mother who will beat her own son
unconscious is embodied in that

00:11:02.925 --> 00:11:08.740
fevered vision of the bags like
the full udders of cows.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.183
So this novel,
this autobiography,

00:11:12.183 --> 00:11:17.608
begins with the sense that this
boy is in danger from

00:11:17.608 --> 00:11:22.929
practically the moment he comes
into the world,

00:11:22.929 --> 00:11:26.629
the moment he comes into
consciousness.

00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:29.962
Then I want to note the
transition that happens at the

00:11:29.962 --> 00:11:32.360
very bottom of this page after
he says,

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.759
"I was chastened whenever I
remembered that my mother had

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:37.796
come close to killing me."
Then we move into something

00:11:37.796 --> 00:11:42.121
that I call a catalog.
There are three of these in the

00:11:42.121 --> 00:11:45.565
first half.
It's a list of sensations or

00:11:45.565 --> 00:11:50.656
perceptions that don't have a
particular narrative structure,

00:11:50.656 --> 00:11:54.435
exactly.
They are just a sort of

00:11:54.435 --> 00:11:59.873
compilation of experience:
Each event spoke with a

00:11:59.873 --> 00:12:02.458
cryptic tone,
and the moments of living

00:12:02.458 --> 00:12:05.179
slowly revealed their coded
meanings.

00:12:05.179 --> 00:12:08.691
There was the wonder I felt
when I saw a brace of

00:12:08.691 --> 00:12:11.910
mountainlike,
spotted, black-and-white horses

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:16.519
clopping down a dusty road
through clouds of powdered clay.

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:20.611
There was the delight I caught
in seeing long straight rows of

00:12:20.611 --> 00:12:24.167
red and green vegetables
stretching away in the sun to

00:12:24.167 --> 00:12:27.097
the bright horizon.
There was the faint,

00:12:27.097 --> 00:12:31.190
cool kiss of sensuality when
dew came to my cheeks and shins

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:34.798
as I ran down the wet green
garden paths in the early

00:12:34.798 --> 00:12:37.632
morning.
There was the vague sense of

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:40.737
the infinite as I looked down
upon the yellow,

00:12:40.737 --> 00:12:44.188
dreaming waters of the
Mississippi from the verdant

00:12:44.188 --> 00:12:47.019
bluffs of Natchez.
I'm going to stop there.

00:12:47.019 --> 00:12:49.621
There's a lot you can say about
these catalogs,

00:12:49.621 --> 00:12:53.015
and when I used to teach the
whole of this text over a course

00:12:53.015 --> 00:12:55.376
of two days,
I would spend a lot of

00:12:55.376 --> 00:12:58.951
time--and, if you want to,
it's worth and it repays the

00:12:58.951 --> 00:13:01.931
time that you could
spend--rereading these and

00:13:01.931 --> 00:13:05.440
thinking about the exact
language: for instance,

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.230
here at the very top of page 8,
when he talks about the

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:12.389
"dreaming waters" of the
Mississippi River.

00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:16.920
What you have there is a moment
when the perception of the child

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:21.380
becomes the perception of the
world imbued with imagination.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:26.649
So the river is not dreaming;
it's Richard who is dreaming.

00:13:26.649 --> 00:13:30.944
So this is in part a catalog
that represents the awakening of

00:13:30.944 --> 00:13:34.953
sensuality, the awakening of the
body to its environment,

00:13:34.953 --> 00:13:38.690
to his environment.
But also, there is this sense

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.430
of imagination,
and you get that in the

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:45.105
dreaming waters;
you get that in the sense of

00:13:45.105 --> 00:13:50.046
travel or the image of the road
that you can see in the green

00:13:50.046 --> 00:13:55.069
and red vegetables stretching
away in their rows to the bright

00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:59.443
horizon.
There is that sense of space,

00:13:59.443 --> 00:14:04.570
of expansiveness,
the possibility of travel.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.755
Why put this next to,
right after,

00:14:08.755 --> 00:14:14.342
that very dramatic scene?
Why is this the moment to enter

00:14:14.342 --> 00:14:19.463
into that meditation?
Well, I think it's because it's

00:14:19.463 --> 00:14:25.037
embodying an oscillation--that
will come back in this

00:14:25.037 --> 00:14:30.719
text--between radical jeopardy
and deprivation and the

00:14:30.719 --> 00:14:37.720
compensation of sensuality,
emotion and imagination.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:43.158
These two oscillate back and
forth so the moment of

00:14:43.158 --> 00:14:48.379
deprivation is often then
balanced by a moment of

00:14:48.379 --> 00:14:52.233
imagination.
And so what I'm going to do is

00:14:52.233 --> 00:14:56.249
just now run through the next
two or three scenes and talk

00:14:56.249 --> 00:14:59.350
about why they're set next to
each other.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:03.925
So the next one we have,
just on page 9--these come

00:15:03.925 --> 00:15:08.958
quite rapidly here--is the day
his mother tells him that

00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:14.540
they're going to Memphis on a
boat called the Kate Adams.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:19.497
He says: 
My eagerness thereafter

00:15:19.497 --> 00:15:23.632
made the days seem endless.
Each night I went to bed hoping

00:15:23.632 --> 00:15:26.630
that the next morning would be
the day of departure.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.980
"How big is the boat?"
I asked my mother.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.200
"As big as a mountain," she
said.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.780
"Has it got a whistle?"
"Yes."

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.870
"Does the whistle blow?"
"Yes."

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.546
"When?"
"When the captain wants it to

00:15:38.546 --> 00:15:40.445
blow."
"Why do they call it the Kate

00:15:40.445 --> 00:15:42.110
Adams?"
"Because that's the boat's

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.820
name."
"What color is the boat?"

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.584
"White."
"How long will we be on the

00:15:46.584 --> 00:15:48.400
boat?"
"All day and all night."

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.270
"Will we sleep on the boat?"
"Yes.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:53.240
When we get sleepy we'll sleep.
Now hush."

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:57.128
For days I had dreamed about a
huge, white boat floating on a

00:15:57.128 --> 00:16:00.235
vast body of water,
but when my mother took me down

00:16:00.235 --> 00:16:03.049
to the levee on the day of
leaving, I saw a tiny,

00:16:03.049 --> 00:16:07.534
dirty boat that was not at all
like the boat I had

00:16:07.534 --> 00:16:12.744
imagined.
If in the catalog imagination

00:16:12.744 --> 00:16:19.549
is awakened, this is what it can
then do for Richard.

00:16:19.549 --> 00:16:24.109
It can endow his daily
experience with a kind of

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:27.647
romance.
But of course this is a poor,

00:16:27.647 --> 00:16:32.870
black child growing up in the
South, and his expectations,

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:37.473
what his mind can imagine,
is always going to be greater

00:16:37.473 --> 00:16:43.765
than what the world can deliver.
So if the landscape invites him

00:16:43.765 --> 00:16:49.546
to grow as an imaginative
person, the social world he

00:16:49.546 --> 00:16:53.611
lives in,
this episode signals to us

00:16:53.611 --> 00:16:59.179
immediately, will never live up
to that imagination.

00:16:59.179 --> 00:17:04.748
There is a sense of
powerlessness that arises from

00:17:04.748 --> 00:17:11.052
the repeated oscillation that
you start to see even set up in

00:17:11.052 --> 00:17:15.150
these first three little
vignettes,

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:19.616
and the problem of
powerlessness is first located

00:17:19.616 --> 00:17:23.059
not centrally in that social
world.

00:17:23.059 --> 00:17:25.822
I don't think we're meant to
understand that the young

00:17:25.822 --> 00:17:28.950
Richard, when he discovers that
the Kate Adams is a dirty,

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:33.501
little boat and not this
romantic vision of a ship he had

00:17:33.501 --> 00:17:37.890
hoped for, that the young
Richard thinks to himself,

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:42.137
"This is because I am a poor,
black boy growing up in the

00:17:42.137 --> 00:17:46.491
South."
It's simply an experience of

00:17:46.491 --> 00:17:50.603
disappointment.
The sense of powerlessness,

00:17:50.603 --> 00:17:53.200
the most profound sense of
powerlessness,

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.162
suggested already by the first
episode where his mother almost

00:17:57.162 --> 00:17:59.630
takes back the life she gave
him,

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:04.019
is rooted in the family.
And we get such a dramatic

00:18:04.019 --> 00:18:07.526
vision of that in the next
episode that follows,

00:18:07.526 --> 00:18:12.034
the episode of the kitten.
So for those of you who haven't

00:18:12.034 --> 00:18:16.270
read, Richard's father works
nights and sleeps during the

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:20.147
day,
and during the day the children

00:18:20.147 --> 00:18:25.789
therefore have to be very quiet.
There is a cat outside the

00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:30.109
apartment building that starts
to meow and the boys are

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:33.723
interested in it.
The father yells at them,

00:18:33.723 --> 00:18:37.510
says, "Make that cat shut up,"
and they can't.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.470
He says, "Make it shut up.
I don't care.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:45.990
Kill it if you have to.
Kill that cat."

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:50.349
Richard at this point already
hates his father.

00:18:50.349 --> 00:18:54.648
His father will abandon the
family quite soon after this

00:18:54.648 --> 00:18:56.948
episode.
For Richard,

00:18:56.948 --> 00:19:02.894
he is mostly this kind of
presence: a cavailing,

00:19:02.894 --> 00:19:08.162
angry, abusive presence.
His resentment over his

00:19:08.162 --> 00:19:12.511
powerlessness within the family
seethes in this moment,

00:19:12.511 --> 00:19:16.700
and he thinks of a way to get
back at his father.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:22.650
"I'll take his words literally;
I will kill the cat," he

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.400
thinks, and so he does.
He hangs the cat.

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:38.818
Richard's mother finds out when
his brother tells on him,

00:19:38.818 --> 00:19:43.980
and the father cannot punish
him.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:49.351
He has taken the father's words
literally when they were not

00:19:49.351 --> 00:19:53.220
meant literally,
but in doing so--in relying on

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.789
his father's words,
in a sense, to protect him,

00:19:56.789 --> 00:20:01.694
even as he subverts them--he
escapes the punishment that

00:20:01.694 --> 00:20:06.420
would otherwise so naturally and
habitually follow.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:13.582
So Richard's first exertion
of agency in this book is

00:20:13.582 --> 00:20:20.114
through the agency of words,
in this case in asserting an

00:20:20.114 --> 00:20:25.311
interpretation of the words at
odds with their intended

00:20:25.311 --> 00:20:28.489
meaning.
It's as if Richard takes those

00:20:28.489 --> 00:20:32.656
words, and he makes them his
own, takes them from his father

00:20:32.656 --> 00:20:36.329
and gains a different kind of
strength from them,

00:20:36.329 --> 00:20:39.920
a strength he can then use to
get back at his father.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:45.348
This is the first instance in
which Richard will do what he

00:20:45.348 --> 00:20:50.589
later describes Mencken doing,
using words as weapons.

00:20:50.589 --> 00:20:55.284
His discovery of Mencken using
words as weapons in a political

00:20:55.284 --> 00:20:59.748
sense is a very powerful moment
for him in his intellectual

00:20:59.748 --> 00:21:02.980
development.
In this case it's a much more

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:07.208
visceral kind of development.
It's the understanding that he

00:21:07.208 --> 00:21:09.869
can make things happen in the
world;

00:21:09.869 --> 00:21:15.475
he can defend himself against
his father's punishment through

00:21:15.475 --> 00:21:20.873
the use of words.
But I want to note that his

00:21:20.873 --> 00:21:25.569
mother takes a different
approach.

00:21:25.569 --> 00:21:31.742
If his father resigns himself
to Richard's subterfuge,

00:21:31.742 --> 00:21:37.100
his mother does not,
and this is on page 12.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.805
He says: 
I had had my first

00:21:38.805 --> 00:21:41.296
triumph over my father.
I had made him believe that I

00:21:41.296 --> 00:21:44.305
had taken his words literally.
He could not punish me now

00:21:44.305 --> 00:21:47.666
without risking his authority.
I was happy because I had at

00:21:47.666 --> 00:21:51.079
last found a way to throw my
criticism of him into his face.

00:21:51.079 --> 00:21:53.827
I had made him feel that if he
whipped me for killing the

00:21:53.827 --> 00:21:56.379
kitten I would never give
serious weight to his words

00:21:56.379 --> 00:21:58.744
again.
I had made him know that I felt

00:21:58.744 --> 00:22:02.190
he was cruel and I had done it
without his punishing me.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.826
But my mother,
being more imaginative,

00:22:04.826 --> 00:22:09.316
retaliated with an assault upon
my sensibilities that crushed me

00:22:09.316 --> 00:22:13.450
with the moral horror involved
in taking a life.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:19.200
And I want to just flip over to
13, about the same place on the

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.765
page.
She's confronted him with

00:22:21.765 --> 00:22:26.210
having knowingly taken the
father's words the wrong way:

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:29.280
"You stop that lying.
You knew what he meant."

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.240
"I didn't," I bawled.
She shoved a tiny spade into my

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.688
hands.
"Go out there,

00:22:34.688 --> 00:22:37.059
dig a hole, and bury that
kitten."

00:22:37.059 --> 00:22:39.545
I stumbled out in to the black
night sobbing,

00:22:39.545 --> 00:22:43.327
my legs wobbly from fear.
Though I knew that I had killed

00:22:43.327 --> 00:22:47.477
the kitten, my mother's words
had made it live again in my

00:22:47.477 --> 00:22:49.591
mind.
What would that kitten do to me

00:22:49.591 --> 00:22:52.099
when I touched it?
Would it claw at my eyes?

00:22:52.099 --> 00:22:55.343
As I groped toward the dead
kitten, my mother lingered

00:22:55.343 --> 00:22:59.014
behind me unseen in the dark,
her disembodied voice egging me

00:22:59.014 --> 00:23:02.804
on.
The mother has her own way of

00:23:02.804 --> 00:23:08.069
using words for power,
and she does it by making the

00:23:08.069 --> 00:23:12.200
kitten live again in his
imagination.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.789
It's as if she is writing
fiction there in that scene.

00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:20.851
She is representing this kitten
that he's killed so that it

00:23:20.851 --> 00:23:24.022
comes back to haunt him.
So, once again,

00:23:24.022 --> 00:23:26.250
there is that immediate
oscillation.

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:33.240
The moment Richard gains some
power from the use of words,

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:39.985
his mother takes it back by
exerting that power herself,

00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:44.400
taking that power away from
him.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:50.238
There is a kind of drum
beat of thematic material as

00:23:50.238 --> 00:23:55.532
these scenes pile up.
The drum beat is all about

00:23:55.532 --> 00:23:59.149
language.
Yes, this is a book about the

00:23:59.149 --> 00:24:03.839
privations of growing up in the
South poor and black,

00:24:03.839 --> 00:24:07.604
but it is very much,
very consciously,

00:24:07.604 --> 00:24:14.319
a book about the development of
someone who attends to language.

00:24:14.319 --> 00:24:17.269
So in these early scenes it's
all about power.

00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:22.087
But it's actually not even
quite so easy or so simple as

00:24:22.087 --> 00:24:27.430
these early scenes that I've
just discussed might make out.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:31.241
Language has powers that are
entirely unpredictable,

00:24:31.241 --> 00:24:35.427
that can't be harnessed in
precisely that deliberate way:

00:24:35.427 --> 00:24:39.612
by making a decision to take
someone's words in the wrong

00:24:39.612 --> 00:24:43.300
way,
or by telling a story to make a

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:49.496
moral point, as the mother does.
So think about the scene

00:24:49.496 --> 00:24:55.190
where Richard gets drinks in the
saloon as a child.

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:59.497
Patrons pay him and give him
drinks to go up and repeat their

00:24:59.497 --> 00:25:02.009
words to other people in the
bar.

00:25:02.009 --> 00:25:05.274
Usually this happens between
men and women,

00:25:05.274 --> 00:25:09.860
so a man will give Richard a
drink and pay him a few pennies

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:14.524
to go to a woman in the bar and
repeat certain things that he

00:25:14.524 --> 00:25:18.609
has trained Richard to say.
In doing this,

00:25:18.609 --> 00:25:23.796
the patrons titter;
everybody sort of has fun with

00:25:23.796 --> 00:25:26.657
this.
Richard has no idea what he is

00:25:26.657 --> 00:25:29.337
saying.
He's simply repeating the

00:25:29.337 --> 00:25:32.910
sounds of the words that are
given to him.

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:38.137
Through this process he becomes
addicted to alcohol at a very

00:25:38.137 --> 00:25:43.017
young age, but at the same time
he learns something about

00:25:43.017 --> 00:25:47.670
language.
It has mysterious powers.

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:52.854
It has capacities to make
things happen in the world that

00:25:52.854 --> 00:25:57.710
he doesn't know how to control.
When he finally emerges from

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:01.181
this time of being a young
drunkard--his mother sort of

00:26:01.181 --> 00:26:05.038
locks him up in the house and
makes sure he can't get out and

00:26:05.038 --> 00:26:08.059
then takes him to work with her
and so on,

00:26:08.059 --> 00:26:12.937
so that he loses that taste for
alcohol--in the text what you

00:26:12.937 --> 00:26:17.571
have right next to that is the
beginning of his insatiable

00:26:17.571 --> 00:26:20.980
questions.
He starts to just torture his

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:25.990
mother with a thousand questions
about everything in the world.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:32.906
The addiction to alcohol is in
a sense replaced by an addiction

00:26:32.906 --> 00:26:36.743
to knowledge.
The experience of having

00:26:36.743 --> 00:26:41.701
language speak through him and
do things that he doesn't

00:26:41.701 --> 00:26:46.930
understand makes him want to
acquire again that agency that

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:52.519
he experienced when he took his
father's words literally.

00:26:52.519 --> 00:26:57.736
This theme comes back in
the scene where his grandmother

00:26:57.736 --> 00:27:01.309
is washing him.
Do you remember this scene?

00:27:01.309 --> 00:27:05.652
His grandmother is washing him
and his brother in the tub,

00:27:05.652 --> 00:27:09.157
and she's washing his butt,
and he says to her,

00:27:09.157 --> 00:27:12.510
"When you're finished,
kiss back there."

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:15.920
And whew!
She's flying off the roof with

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.922
anger, chasing him around the
house trying to whip him with a

00:27:19.922 --> 00:27:22.522
wet towel,
so on and so forth:

00:27:22.522 --> 00:27:28.359
a very dramatic scene again of
powerlessness within the family,

00:27:28.359 --> 00:27:33.140
of being the victim of violence
within the family.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:37.288
But in this case it's a
response produced in the

00:27:37.288 --> 00:27:42.319
negative register similar to the
responses produced in the

00:27:42.319 --> 00:27:44.270
saloon.
He says something,

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:47.319
and he doesn't really know
where those words come from.

00:27:47.319 --> 00:27:51.888
He doesn't really know what
made his granny so angry about

00:27:51.888 --> 00:27:55.456
those words.
He doesn't understand the words

00:27:55.456 --> 00:27:57.430
that he's used,
but boy!

00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:03.595
Did they produce a response!
So there is this sense in

00:28:03.595 --> 00:28:08.338
which the story of a developing
writer is the story of someone

00:28:08.338 --> 00:28:12.615
learning--even before they learn
how to control language

00:28:12.615 --> 00:28:16.269
fully--that language has these
capacities.

00:28:16.269 --> 00:28:21.197
Well, there is another element,
though, to the kind of language

00:28:21.197 --> 00:28:25.806
that Richard is describing
learning, and that is the racial

00:28:25.806 --> 00:28:28.788
element.
He is learning a racialized

00:28:28.788 --> 00:28:32.846
language.
And here I want to look at

00:28:32.846 --> 00:28:38.696
page--let's see--page 79,
actually first on 47,

00:28:38.696 --> 00:28:42.870
just in passing quickly.
You know what?

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:44.240
I'm looking at my watch.
We don't have time.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:51.806
We'll go straight to 79.
On page 79 we get an account of

00:28:51.806 --> 00:28:58.943
a conversation between Richard
and his friends and it's

00:28:58.943 --> 00:29:04.230
annotated with interpretative
asides.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:06.130
So I'm going to start in the
middle of this:

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:14.670
The crowd laughs long and
loud.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:16.363
[This is in the middle of the
page.]

00:29:16.363 --> 00:29:19.266
"Man, them white folks oughta
catch you and send you to a zoo

00:29:19.266 --> 00:29:23.268
and keep you for the next war!"
Throwing the subject in to a

00:29:23.268 --> 00:29:25.544
wider field.
"Then when that fighting

00:29:25.544 --> 00:29:28.605
starts, they oughta feed you on
buttermilk and black-eyed peas

00:29:28.605 --> 00:29:31.579
and let you break wind!"
The subject is accepted and

00:29:31.579 --> 00:29:33.763
extended.
"You'd win the war with a new

00:29:33.763 --> 00:29:36.349
kind of poison gas!"
A shouted climax.

00:29:36.349 --> 00:29:39.660
There is high laughter that
simmers down slowly.

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:42.500
"Maybe poison gas is something
good to have."

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.252
The subject of white folks is
associationally swept into the

00:29:46.252 --> 00:29:48.898
orbit of talk.
"Yeah, if they have a race riot

00:29:48.898 --> 00:29:52.260
round here, I'm gonna kill all
the white folks with my poison."

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.279
Bitter pride.
Gleeful laughter.

00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:57.761
Then silence,
each waiting for the other to

00:29:57.761 --> 00:30:00.814
contribute something.
"Them white folks sure scared

00:30:00.814 --> 00:30:03.112
of us, though."
Sober statement of an old

00:30:03.112 --> 00:30:07.281
problem.
What we see here is a doubled

00:30:07.281 --> 00:30:09.904
voice.
This is a moment when the

00:30:09.904 --> 00:30:14.039
narrative voice begins to split
in a very conscious way.

00:30:14.039 --> 00:30:17.878
So what you have is the account
of Richard and his friends

00:30:17.878 --> 00:30:21.683
talking in the past,
and you have the present

00:30:21.683 --> 00:30:27.590
narrator's parsing of how this
language relates to topics that

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:33.497
impinge upon their very context,
the racial realities of the

00:30:33.497 --> 00:30:36.239
South.
So what you see here is a

00:30:36.239 --> 00:30:40.000
narrator who has learned to do
that parsing.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.892
Some of these terms that he
uses are literary--climax,

00:30:43.892 --> 00:30:48.299
the creation of suspense--so
he's tracking this as if it were

00:30:48.299 --> 00:30:53.070
the development of a narrative.
But he's also suggesting how

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:57.550
humor is used to broach topics
that are impossible to talk

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:02.598
about in more direct ways,
or that feel dangerous to these

00:31:02.598 --> 00:31:08.045
boys to approach in more direct
ways.So there is a kind of

00:31:08.045 --> 00:31:13.492
grammar of race that this boy is
learning while he experiences

00:31:13.492 --> 00:31:17.690
language in all these other more
visceral,

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:21.472
family-oriented ways.
There is this social context of

00:31:21.472 --> 00:31:24.589
race relations whose grammar he
is also learning,

00:31:24.589 --> 00:31:29.110
and I would just remind you of
the passage where he starts to

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:33.480
ask his mother about whether his
granny is white or not.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.188
There's a long conversation,
and she gets very frustrated

00:31:36.188 --> 00:31:38.339
with him.
She doesn't really want to

00:31:38.339 --> 00:31:42.761
answer that question.
She is a woman who looks very

00:31:42.761 --> 00:31:48.443
white but is categorized as
black in that system of the

00:31:48.443 --> 00:31:51.982
South.
And so Richard is learning a

00:31:51.982 --> 00:31:57.258
grammar of race even while he
tries to work out how to use

00:31:57.258 --> 00:32:01.609
language as a source of power in
his family.

00:32:01.609 --> 00:32:05.514
The split voice,
the development of what you

00:32:05.514 --> 00:32:09.834
could say is that racial double
consciousness that W.

00:32:09.834 --> 00:32:10.167
E.
B.

00:32:10.167 --> 00:32:14.155
Du Bois talks about,
that double consciousness of

00:32:14.155 --> 00:32:18.226
the racial reality,
is manifested in that split in

00:32:18.226 --> 00:32:23.041
the narrative.
In "The Horror and the Glory,"

00:32:23.041 --> 00:32:27.648
the second half of the book as
originally written,

00:32:27.648 --> 00:32:31.410
that voice becomes the
parenthetical.

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:33.950
It takes another development
altogether.

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:42.180
So if you look in certain
passages--Let's see.

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:59.930
On 272 and 273--actually,
I'm going to start on 271.

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:02.985
This is where Richard is
talking about the waitresses,

00:33:02.985 --> 00:33:06.098
the white waitresses he works
with in the restaurant in

00:33:06.098 --> 00:33:08.194
Chicago.
This is what he says about them

00:33:08.194 --> 00:33:10.369
about three quarters of the way
down the page:

00:33:10.369 --> 00:33:13.553
During my lunch hour,
which I spent on a bench in a

00:33:13.553 --> 00:33:16.679
nearby park, the waitresses
would come and sit beside me

00:33:16.679 --> 00:33:18.844
talking at random,
laughing, joking,

00:33:18.844 --> 00:33:21.417
smoking cigarettes.
I learned about their tawdry

00:33:21.417 --> 00:33:23.771
dreams, their simple hopes,
their home lives,

00:33:23.771 --> 00:33:26.820
their fear of feeling anything
deeply, their sex problems,

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.996
their husbands.
They were an eager,

00:33:28.996 --> 00:33:31.035
restless, talkative,
ignorant bunch,

00:33:31.035 --> 00:33:33.890
but casually kind and
impersonal for all that.

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:37.543
They knew nothing of hate and
fear, and strove instinctively

00:33:37.543 --> 00:33:41.675
to avoid all passion.
That commentary that you get

00:33:41.675 --> 00:33:46.597
right in the scene--not in the
parenthetical--it's as if the

00:33:46.597 --> 00:33:52.019
voice of Richard remembering the
early parts of his childhood,

00:33:52.019 --> 00:33:55.238
the voice that can parse a
conversation,

00:33:55.238 --> 00:34:00.190
is then part of what gets
remembered as part of the scene.

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:04.300
When Richard is with those
waitresses, he's reflecting on

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.089
these things as he experiences
them.

00:34:07.089 --> 00:34:09.732
But there is a second kind
of development,

00:34:09.732 --> 00:34:12.844
and this gets to that second
childhood he invokes that

00:34:12.844 --> 00:34:15.369
happens to him when he goes to
Chicago.

00:34:15.369 --> 00:34:20.987
There is a social analysis that
he begins to be able to advance

00:34:20.987 --> 00:34:25.789
partly due to his reading in
Marxism, in sociology.

00:34:25.789 --> 00:34:29.481
Wright was very interested in
the sociology of the 1930s and

00:34:29.481 --> 00:34:32.170
'40s.
He read a lot in that vein.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:35.948
He was very interested in
economics, and he wanted to

00:34:35.948 --> 00:34:40.090
understand how the social
structures of capitalism and the

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:44.014
economic structures of
capitalism impinged upon the way

00:34:44.014 --> 00:34:48.153
personalities were formed.
And that's why he's interested

00:34:48.153 --> 00:34:50.389
in the emotions of these
waitresses.

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:55.364
And in fact the question of
emotion bears directly on his

00:34:55.364 --> 00:35:00.753
sense of what books are for.
There is a remarkable moment on

00:35:00.753 --> 00:35:05.849
page 280 where he talks about
his aspiration as a writer.

00:35:05.849 --> 00:35:09.949
And this is remarkable for how
different it is from someone

00:35:09.949 --> 00:35:14.260
like Nabokov or John Barth or
many of our other writers on the

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.219
syllabus:
If I could fasten the

00:35:17.219 --> 00:35:21.522
mind of the reader upon words so
firmly that he would forget

00:35:21.522 --> 00:35:24.949
words and be conscious only of
his response,

00:35:24.949 --> 00:35:28.599
I felt that I would be in sight
of knowing how to write

00:35:28.599 --> 00:35:31.437
narrative.
I strove to master words,

00:35:31.437 --> 00:35:35.329
to make them disappear,
to make them important by

00:35:35.329 --> 00:35:38.764
making them new,
to make them melt into a rising

00:35:38.764 --> 00:35:42.309
spiral of emotional stimuli,
each greater than the other,

00:35:42.309 --> 00:35:45.522
each feeding and reinforcing
the other, and all ending in an

00:35:45.522 --> 00:35:48.735
emotional climax that would
drench the reader with the sense

00:35:48.735 --> 00:35:51.800
of a new world.
That was the single aim of my

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.780
living.
That's remarkable for a writer

00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:01.179
to say, "I want to write so that
my words disappear."

00:36:01.179 --> 00:36:05.710
He doesn't want us to see the
art of his sentences.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:09.988
He wants us to feel,
and it is in fact feeling,

00:36:09.988 --> 00:36:15.290
that he credits to novels,
that allows him to imagine that

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:19.289
he himself could have a
different life.

00:36:19.289 --> 00:36:23.054
And he talks about this if you
look at the published ending on

00:36:23.054 --> 00:36:28.127
413 that we find in the notes,
when this second half wasn't

00:36:28.127 --> 00:36:32.885
there, when he asks,
"How dare I consider my

00:36:32.885 --> 00:36:39.744
feelings superior to the gross
environment that sought to claim

00:36:39.744 --> 00:36:44.135
me?"
He states the problem of living

00:36:44.135 --> 00:36:50.705
in the South as a problem of
feeling, that he needed to claim

00:36:50.705 --> 00:36:55.139
and consider his own feelings.
He says: 

00:36:55.139 --> 00:36:59.155
It had only been through
books, at best no more than

00:36:59.155 --> 00:37:03.791
vicarious cultural transfusions,
that I had managed to keep

00:37:03.791 --> 00:37:07.239
myself alive in a negatively
vital way.

00:37:07.239 --> 00:37:09.960
My belief in books had risen
more out of a sense of

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:13.225
desperation than from my abiding
conviction of their ultimate

00:37:13.225 --> 00:37:15.337
value.
[And I'm just going to skip

00:37:15.337 --> 00:37:15.860
down.]
.

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:20.418
It had been my accidental
reading of fiction and literary

00:37:20.418 --> 00:37:24.976
criticism that had invoked in me
vague glimpses of life's

00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:28.929
possibilities.
Reading for him is a way of

00:37:28.929 --> 00:37:32.485
accessing feeling,
and that's the kind of reading

00:37:32.485 --> 00:37:36.189
that he wants from us,
from the people who read his

00:37:36.189 --> 00:37:36.930
book.

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:47.301
The kind of feeling that he
wants us to have is sort of

00:37:47.301 --> 00:37:53.077
stated in that alternate ending,
but "The Horror and the Glory"

00:37:53.077 --> 00:37:57.122
shows how that kind of feeling
enters in to a much larger

00:37:57.122 --> 00:38:00.192
cultural analysis.
That piece of it,

00:38:00.192 --> 00:38:04.300
which is gone when the second
half disappears,

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:09.505
that piece of it is what he
tries to communicate in a very

00:38:09.505 --> 00:38:13.024
condensed way.
And I want now to show you some

00:38:13.024 --> 00:38:15.039
of those letters that I
mentioned.

00:38:15.039 --> 00:38:19.550
(Andrew, can you get the screen
and the lights?

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:30.077
I am switching gears pretty
quickly here 'cause we don't

00:38:30.077 --> 00:38:40.030
have a lot of time.) As I
explained last time,

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:45.524
it was the Book of the Month
Club that caused him to make

00:38:45.524 --> 00:38:50.316
this change in his account.
And what I have in front of you

00:38:50.316 --> 00:38:54.082
right now is the second page of
the first letter that Dorothy

00:38:54.082 --> 00:38:58.644
Canfield Fisher wrote to Wright,
where she first raises the

00:38:58.644 --> 00:39:03.920
problem that she sees in the
ending as he has revised it.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:08.127
Now the shame here is that
she's talking about a version of

00:39:08.127 --> 00:39:12.190
the ending you see in that note
on 413 in our edition.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:15.208
She is talking about an early
draft of that ending,

00:39:15.208 --> 00:39:18.929
and it's not in the Beinecke.
I don't know where it is.

00:39:18.929 --> 00:39:22.192
I don't know where the drafts
that accompanied these

00:39:22.192 --> 00:39:25.091
correspondences are.
Now it's just possible that

00:39:25.091 --> 00:39:28.185
they're in that big archive
somewhere, and I just haven't

00:39:28.185 --> 00:39:30.832
found them yet.
So if any of you want to be an

00:39:30.832 --> 00:39:32.870
archive sleuth and find them,
great.

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:36.710
I looked and I can't find them.
Sometimes when correspondence

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:39.814
is saved you run into these
kinds of problems,

00:39:39.814 --> 00:39:44.159
so we have to guess a little
bit at what she was looking at.

00:39:44.159 --> 00:39:50.010
What I want to point out to
you is this part of her letter,

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:53.784
the third paragraph here,
where she says,

00:39:53.784 --> 00:39:57.984
"My idea is this."
In the first part of the

00:39:57.984 --> 00:40:02.853
letter, she has made some
sentence-level suggestions for

00:40:02.853 --> 00:40:07.426
the end of the book,
and now she embarks very

00:40:07.426 --> 00:40:13.239
tentatively on her major
suggestion: "My idea is this.

00:40:13.239 --> 00:40:17.221
You ask a question all of your
many readers have asked

00:40:17.221 --> 00:40:21.880
themselves about you with an
eagerness full of anxious hope.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.880
What was it that always made me
feel that way?

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:28.929
What was it that made me
conscious of possibilities?

00:40:28.929 --> 00:40:31.460
From where had I caught a sense
of freedom?"

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.617
And if you've read the ending
in the notes,

00:40:33.617 --> 00:40:36.750
you'll remember those passages
where he asks that question.

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:40.760
And his answer in that
published version is,

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:44.081
"From books."
But this is what she is

00:40:44.081 --> 00:40:46.611
thinking:
We too ask ourselves that

00:40:46.611 --> 00:40:48.793
question, "we" meaning those
Americans who,

00:40:48.793 --> 00:40:51.860
following the example of their
parents and grandparents,

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:55.158
have done what they could to
lighten this dark stain of

00:40:55.158 --> 00:40:57.480
racial discrimination in our
nation.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.575
What we have hoped,
faintly hoped,

00:40:59.575 --> 00:41:03.068
was that those efforts of men
of good will have somewhat

00:41:03.068 --> 00:41:05.735
availed,
a little, enough so that those

00:41:05.735 --> 00:41:09.735
suffering from racial injustice
might catch a passing glimpse of

00:41:09.735 --> 00:41:13.545
the fact that they are rooted in
those American principles so

00:41:13.545 --> 00:41:16.402
mocked and degraded by the
practices of racial

00:41:16.402 --> 00:41:19.826
discrimination.
In what else could they be

00:41:19.826 --> 00:41:22.888
rooted?
That they exist is a proof that

00:41:22.888 --> 00:41:27.214
American ideals are not the
tawdry pretenses they are so

00:41:27.214 --> 00:41:30.640
often accused of being.
[And then I'm going to skip

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.889
down to the bottom of the next
paragraph.].

00:41:32.889 --> 00:41:36.901
To keep that conception in
regard to decent race relations

00:41:36.901 --> 00:41:41.124
alive and growing has been the
aspiration of generation after

00:41:41.124 --> 00:41:44.079
generation in many an American
family,

00:41:44.079 --> 00:41:46.679
judging by my own and by those
I know.

00:41:46.679 --> 00:41:50.604
To receive in the closing pages
of your book one word of

00:41:50.604 --> 00:41:55.066
recognition for this aspiration,
if it were possible for you to

00:41:55.066 --> 00:41:59.139
give such recognition honestly,
would hearten all who believe

00:41:59.139 --> 00:42:02.829
in American ideals.
This is quite striking.

00:42:02.829 --> 00:42:06.353
Imagine that you are Richard
Wright, and you've grown up with

00:42:06.353 --> 00:42:08.820
the life that he describes in
this book.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:13.171
Now you've read some of it.
And you're being asked to

00:42:13.171 --> 00:42:17.816
suggest in the closing pages of
the autobiography--which is

00:42:17.816 --> 00:42:21.500
closing where you did not want
it to close,

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:25.027
in the middle of your book,
not at the end of your

00:42:25.027 --> 00:42:29.130
book--you're being asked to
essentially thank the good,

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:35.158
liberal white people who have
been working on behalf of the

00:42:35.158 --> 00:42:41.404
end of racial discrimination.
Well, Wright finds this an

00:42:41.404 --> 00:42:45.739
extremely difficult request to
respond to.

00:42:45.739 --> 00:42:52.550
And you can track it here in
his response.

00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:02.699
I'm going to read from here so
I can actually see it.

00:43:02.699 --> 00:43:04.150
"Your more general"-- He says,
"Okay.

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:06.199
I'll respond to those
sentence-level things."

00:43:06.199 --> 00:43:09.539
Your more general
suggestion was much harder to

00:43:09.539 --> 00:43:12.168
deal with.
I fully understand the value of

00:43:12.168 --> 00:43:14.325
what you are driving at,
but frankly,

00:43:14.325 --> 00:43:17.922
the narrative as it now stands
simply will not support a more

00:43:17.922 --> 00:43:22.038
general or hopeful conclusion.
The Negro who flees the South

00:43:22.038 --> 00:43:24.701
is really a refugee.
He is so pinched and

00:43:24.701 --> 00:43:28.187
straightened in his environment
that his leaving is more an

00:43:28.187 --> 00:43:31.766
avoidance than an embrace.
For me, it has been my reading

00:43:31.766 --> 00:43:35.315
of fiction--far removed from
political considerations--that

00:43:35.315 --> 00:43:39.171
evoked in me a sense of personal
freedom or the possibilities of

00:43:39.171 --> 00:43:42.234
escaping the South.
I added a paragraph to the body

00:43:42.234 --> 00:43:44.550
of the epilogue expanding this
notion.

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:49.329
And I take that to be the
paragraph where he talks about

00:43:49.329 --> 00:43:53.239
what fiction has done for him
specifically.

00:43:53.239 --> 00:43:55.860
Canfield Fisher is not
satisfied with this.

00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:00.340
She comes back at the problem.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.750
This is at the bottom of the
letter:

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:18.218
I gather that you cannot
bring yourself to use even once

00:44:18.218 --> 00:44:22.445
the word "American" in speaking
of "the tinge of warmth which

00:44:22.445 --> 00:44:27.510
came from an unseen light,"
such a beautiful,

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:32.304
sensitive phrase.
Some of the novels and stories

00:44:32.304 --> 00:44:33.991
you read were,
it is probable,

00:44:33.991 --> 00:44:36.260
laid in your own country of
America.

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:39.529
Hence, some of the characters
in books through whom you had

00:44:39.529 --> 00:44:43.079
glimpsed life's possibilities
were fellow Americans of yours.

00:44:43.079 --> 00:44:47.485
These unseen lights which shone
through them upon your faith

00:44:47.485 --> 00:44:52.039
were reflections of American
efforts to live up to an idea.

00:44:52.039 --> 00:44:55.058
Those characters could have
been no other than products of

00:44:55.058 --> 00:44:57.972
American tradition.
However dimly that light came

00:44:57.972 --> 00:45:00.707
through to you,
suffering so acutely from the

00:45:00.707 --> 00:45:04.250
rough denial of the very
existence of American ideals,

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:08.803
part of it must have come
through American delineation of

00:45:08.803 --> 00:45:13.770
American characters.
Now keep in mind this is 1944.

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:20.314
This is the summer of 1944.
America is just joining the war

00:45:20.314 --> 00:45:24.849
effort in Europe.
This is a fight against fascism.

00:45:24.849 --> 00:45:28.233
That's the way that it was
presented to the American

00:45:28.233 --> 00:45:30.820
public: a fight against Nazi
Germany.

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:34.643
And in later letters in this
series between her and Richard,

00:45:34.643 --> 00:45:38.401
and also in the review (the
little sort of summary that she

00:45:38.401 --> 00:45:42.030
wrote up for the Book of the
Month Club newsletter),

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:45.787
she invokes the Nazis
specifically as a comparison to

00:45:45.787 --> 00:45:49.978
the kind of oppression that
Richard was trying to escape in

00:45:49.978 --> 00:45:52.764
the South.
So this is caught up in a

00:45:52.764 --> 00:45:56.740
moment of patriotism where
American freedom is being held

00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:00.888
up very much as the ideal,
that thing that we fight for

00:46:00.888 --> 00:46:06.967
when we go to Europe to fight.
And so to have Richard present

00:46:06.967 --> 00:46:14.502
this picture of America that
doesn't ring the changes of that

00:46:14.502 --> 00:46:20.530
patriotism comes to be a problem
in her mind.

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:24.339
Now when Black Boy was
published there was a war bond

00:46:24.339 --> 00:46:27.309
advertisement on the back cover
of the book.

00:46:27.309 --> 00:46:31.100
It really was just,
even as a physical object,

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:35.059
all bound up with the politics
of its moment.

00:46:35.059 --> 00:46:38.825
Richard's response to
this--we just have two seconds,

00:46:38.825 --> 00:46:44.083
and I want to show it to you.
I love these pieces because you

00:46:44.083 --> 00:46:48.280
can just see him struggling on
the page.

00:46:55.230 --> 00:47:01.010
(Sorry.) This is his first
attempt at writing back to her.

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:04.140
See all the scribbles?
This was hard for him.

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:07.271
There are two other drafts.
If you go and look at them,

00:47:07.271 --> 00:47:10.867
it's quite interesting.
He's trying extremely hard to

00:47:10.867 --> 00:47:14.379
make an answer,
and what he ends up doing is

00:47:14.379 --> 00:47:18.869
bringing that knowledge that he
built up in Chicago,

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:22.263
the knowledge that he gets from
reading economics and sociology

00:47:22.263 --> 00:47:24.679
and Marxism.
He gives an analysis of

00:47:24.679 --> 00:47:28.996
industrial capitalism.
That's the kind of framework he

00:47:28.996 --> 00:47:33.898
uses to try to get her to
understand what it would mean to

00:47:33.898 --> 00:47:39.529
be a Negro in the South,
how isolated he was culturally,

00:47:39.529 --> 00:47:45.721
how impossible it is to see
something like an ideal America

00:47:45.721 --> 00:47:51.380
of freedom and justice from that
subject position.

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:55.811
In the end,
the compromise is that he notes

00:47:55.811 --> 00:48:01.400
several writers including
Dreiser and Sherwood Anderson.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:06.337
And I just want to have you
compare the catalog of writers

00:48:06.337 --> 00:48:09.721
on 413 that he mentions.
They are Dreiser,

00:48:09.721 --> 00:48:11.185
Edgar Lee Masters,
H.L.

00:48:11.185 --> 00:48:13.914
Mencken, Anderson,
and Lewis: all American

00:48:13.914 --> 00:48:16.918
writers.
Compare that with the catalog

00:48:16.918 --> 00:48:21.562
that he gives of his reading on
249, and you'll see what's being

00:48:21.562 --> 00:48:22.300
elided.

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:33.413
This is the top of 249.
So certainly we have Sinclair

00:48:33.413 --> 00:48:36.929
Lewis, Sherwood Anderson,
but then we have Dostoevsky,

00:48:36.929 --> 00:48:38.599
George Moore,
Gustave Flaubert,

00:48:38.599 --> 00:48:40.435
Maupassant, Tolstoy,
Frank Harris,

00:48:40.435 --> 00:48:42.250
Mark Twain,
Thomas Hardy,

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:44.438
Arnold Bennett,
Stephen Crane,

00:48:44.438 --> 00:48:46.550
Zola, Norris,
Gorky, Bergson,

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:48.420
Ibsen,
Balzac.

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:52.741
You get the point.
This is a very cosmopolitan

00:48:52.741 --> 00:48:55.891
reading list.
What Canfield Fisher asks him

00:48:55.891 --> 00:48:58.769
to present is a totally
nationalistic one.

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:03.116
My point in sum,
what I want you to take away

00:49:03.116 --> 00:49:08.368
from this, is to see how an
account of a life is struggling

00:49:08.368 --> 00:49:13.440
against forces outside of
itself--publishing forces,

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:18.598
the forces of politics,
of war, of an editor--how a

00:49:18.598 --> 00:49:24.686
writer is struggling to make his
account faithful to his own

00:49:24.686 --> 00:49:28.738
artistic vision,
his own social vision,

00:49:28.738 --> 00:49:33.168
against those forces,
and how those forces have an

00:49:33.168 --> 00:49:36.963
impact--try as he might,
have an impact--on what the

00:49:36.963 --> 00:49:39.270
text looks like when we hold it
in our hands.

00:49:42.289 --> 00:49:45.813
Black Boy or American
Hunger is a dramatic

00:49:45.813 --> 00:49:49.529
example, and--thanks to the
Beinecke and to the scholarship

00:49:49.529 --> 00:49:53.246
that's been done on it by the
editor who brought this whole

00:49:53.246 --> 00:49:56.449
text out in the 1990s,
Arnold Rampersad--thanks to

00:49:56.449 --> 00:49:58.380
that work we get to see it up
close;

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:02.199
we get to see what that
back-and-forth looks like.

00:50:02.199 --> 00:50:06.143
We'll have another version of
this when we think about

00:50:06.143 --> 00:50:10.533
Lolita, which in your
edition has an essay at the end

00:50:10.533 --> 00:50:14.030
called "On a Novel Entitled
Lolita."

00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:17.554
That's only there because
someone tried to censor that

00:50:17.554 --> 00:50:20.092
book.
It's another example of how the

00:50:20.092 --> 00:50:24.170
world comes to impinge on and
change our reading experience.

00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:28.695
It's something that we will
come back to and explore more in

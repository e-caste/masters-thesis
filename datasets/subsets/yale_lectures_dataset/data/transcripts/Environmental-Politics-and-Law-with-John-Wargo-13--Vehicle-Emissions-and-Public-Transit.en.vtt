00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.176
Prof: So I wanted to
continue talking about air

00:00:04.176 --> 00:00:05.790
quality today and air quality
law.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.010
And also to make some comments
about Whitman v.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.905
American Trucker in
response to a couple of

00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:14.400
questions.
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.855
So with respect to
Whitman,

00:00:17.855 --> 00:00:23.510
EPA in 1997 had proposed new PM
and ozone standards.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.222
And both the Northeastern
states and California supported

00:00:27.222 --> 00:00:28.350
these measures.
 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.558
And members of Congress from
the Midwestern states did not

00:00:31.558 --> 00:00:32.290
support it.
 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.240
This is quite common with air
quality standards.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.736
It was unprecedented in EPA's
history for a single change in a

00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:43.937
national ambient air quality
standard to have twenty-eight

00:00:43.937 --> 00:00:46.370
days of hearings in Congress.
 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.767
And finally,
this was brought to court and

00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:53.910
made its way to the Court of
Appeals in the D.C.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.530
Circuit.
 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.330
And the Circuit found that the
standards were unconstitutional.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.683
It was eventually elevated up
to the Supreme Court,

00:01:01.683 --> 00:01:05.239
and I read you the conclusion
of the Supreme Court.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.138
But they also raised a separate
question about the consideration

00:01:10.138 --> 00:01:14.337
of costs and whether or not
costs should be part of the

00:01:14.337 --> 00:01:15.349
calculus.
 

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:19.792
In "Section 109(b)(1)
instructs the EPA to set primary

00:01:19.792 --> 00:01:23.860
ambient air quality standards,
the attainment and maintenance

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.632
of which are requisite to
protect public health with an

00:01:26.632 --> 00:01:28.430
adequate margin of safety."
 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.909
That seems rather clear.
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.495
However, they went on,
saying that "the

00:01:32.495 --> 00:01:35.983
respondents argue that many more
factors than air pollution

00:01:35.983 --> 00:01:38.510
affect public health...In
particular,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.114
the economic costs of
implementing a very stringent

00:01:41.114 --> 00:01:44.241
standard might produce health
losses sufficient to offset the

00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:46.690
health gains achieved in
cleaning the air,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.247
for example,
by closing down whole

00:01:48.247 --> 00:01:50.655
industries and thereby
impoverishing the workers and

00:01:50.655 --> 00:01:53.110
consumers dependent upon those
industries."

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.732
So this is unquestionably true,
and the Congress was

00:01:55.732 --> 00:01:57.840
unquestionably aware of it at
the time.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.962
In considering the role of
economics in decision-making and

00:02:01.962 --> 00:02:05.870
how that might be balanced
against estimates of risk and

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.780
the benefits from tougher air
quality regulations,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.668
the court continued
"Congress had commissioned

00:02:12.668 --> 00:02:15.902
in the Air Quality Act of 1967 a
detailed estimate of the

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:19.080
economic impact of air quality
standards on the nation's

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.882
industries,
communities,

00:02:20.882 --> 00:02:24.819
and other contributing sources
of pollution...The 1970 Congress

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.060
not only anticipated the
compliance costs that could

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.968
injure the public health,
but provided for that precise

00:02:31.968 --> 00:02:33.038
exigency."
 

00:02:33.038 --> 00:02:36.275
And Section 110 of the Clean
Air Act permitted the

00:02:36.275 --> 00:02:39.510
administrator to waive the
compliance deadline for

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.473
stationary sources if sufficient
control measures were simply

00:02:43.473 --> 00:02:46.907
unavailable and "the
continued operation of such

00:02:46.907 --> 00:02:50.407
sources was found to be
essential to the public health

00:02:50.407 --> 00:02:52.190
or welfare."
 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.562
And Section 202 prescribed that
emissions standards for

00:02:55.562 --> 00:02:59.247
automobiles could take effect
only "after such a period

00:02:59.247 --> 00:03:02.433
that the administrator finds
necessary to permit the

00:03:02.433 --> 00:03:06.370
development and application of
the requisite technology,

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.521
giving appropriate
consideration to the cost of

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.300
compliance within such
period."

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.107
So EPA could decide that it's
time for a new air quality

00:03:13.107 --> 00:03:15.646
standard,
but they could find that the

00:03:15.646 --> 00:03:19.914
economic effects were so intense
that they could delay that and

00:03:19.914 --> 00:03:23.081
offer the industry the
opportunity to retool or

00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:27.348
reorganize in order to develop
the necessary technology,

00:03:27.348 --> 00:03:31.896
say a new emission control
system in order to meet that new

00:03:31.896 --> 00:03:32.758
standard.
 

00:03:32.758 --> 00:03:37.751
So despite this consideration
of cost, the court found that

00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:43.258
the engine driving nearly all of
Title I is Section 109(b)(1).

00:03:43.258 --> 00:03:46.503
And I commend you to read this,
you can call it up on EPA's

00:03:46.503 --> 00:03:48.712
website,
that these standards have to be

00:03:48.712 --> 00:03:51.641
set to protect public health
with this margin of safety to

00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:54.110
account for uncertainty in the
risk estimate.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.381
So when in interpreting the
statutory text,

00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:58.110
Congress does not,
one might say,

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.949
hide elephants in mouse holes.
 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:02.158
So they overturned the
appellate ruling.

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:06.414
I want to take you back to
where I left you on Tuesday and

00:04:06.414 --> 00:04:10.597
talk a little bit more about
asthma and the prevalence of

00:04:10.597 --> 00:04:15.151
asthma and the finding by Mark
Cullen and Eileen Storey at the

00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:19.482
University of Connecticut that
between three and twenty-two

00:04:19.482 --> 00:04:23.961
percent of kids in Connecticut
schools have been diagnosed by

00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:25.528
physicians.
 

00:04:25.528 --> 00:04:28.370
And by the way,
one of the gold standards for

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.052
recognizing an illness in a
population would be looking at

00:04:32.052 --> 00:04:35.670
whether or not it had been
diagnosed by a physician.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.906
And in schools,
it's interesting that if your

00:04:37.906 --> 00:04:40.857
child is on any medication,
then you have to register those

00:04:40.857 --> 00:04:42.790
medications with the school
nurse.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.019
So the school nurse has to keep
very tight control.

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:49.449
In fact, they maintain the meds
in the nurses' offices so that

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.663
this is a really interesting and
important and high quality

00:04:53.663 --> 00:04:55.769
method of record keeping.
 

00:04:55.769 --> 00:04:59.702
So Mark and I and several
others wondered together about

00:04:59.702 --> 00:05:03.923
what the causes of the rise in
asthma might have been during

00:05:03.923 --> 00:05:05.639
the 1980s and 1990s.
 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.281
And we started thinking about
what had changed,

00:05:08.281 --> 00:05:11.555
whether or not kids might be
exposed to different kinds of

00:05:11.555 --> 00:05:12.360
chemicals.
 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.230
And I left you also with this
lung section.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.877
And I wanted to come back to
this, because I didn't explain

00:05:18.877 --> 00:05:20.430
it very carefully the other day.
 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.687
So on the left is basically rat
lung tissue exposed to low

00:05:23.687 --> 00:05:25.689
concentrations of diesel
exhaust.

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:29.733
And what you see is the
coagulation between cells of the

00:05:29.733 --> 00:05:33.189
particulate matter,
the carbon in those that are

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:35.910
exposed at higher
concentrations.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.879
Now what this suggests is that
you might think about scenarios

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:42.940
that would lead to higher levels
of exposure.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.790
So what might those be?
 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.449
Well, we're talking about black
carbon in this case.

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.310
So when are people more exposed
to combustion byproducts?

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.310
So one of the things you should
always think about in terms of

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.310
those that are more exposed
would be occupational settings.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.427
So how about,
for example,

00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:02.189
miners?
 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:05.322
So in coal mines,
the coal dust is also carbon

00:06:05.322 --> 00:06:05.810
dust.
 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.579
But also, they use diesel
generators to provide

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:14.581
electricity to basically give
energy to the jackhammers and to

00:06:14.581 --> 00:06:18.269
the lighting that they have in
the mines.

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:22.113
So the combination of
unventilated diesel generator

00:06:22.113 --> 00:06:26.420
fumes on top of the coal dust
leads to high exposures.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.949
And what about truck drivers?
 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:30.355
It was interesting,
after the study that I'm going

00:06:30.355 --> 00:06:32.269
to review with you in a few
moments,

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:35.839
I received a phone call from
someone who had seen it,

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:39.290
and they wondered whether or
not they should get involved.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.747
This was the American
Federation of Labor,

00:06:42.747 --> 00:06:43.930
the AFL-CIO.
 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.468
They were concerned that they
were an organization or truck

00:06:47.468 --> 00:06:51.007
drivers that really might be one
of the more highly exposed

00:06:51.007 --> 00:06:51.680
groups.
 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.394
Highly exposed because they sit
inside their trucks all day

00:06:54.394 --> 00:06:57.288
long,
and especially in urban areas

00:06:57.288 --> 00:07:00.588
where traffic comes to a
standstill,

00:07:00.588 --> 00:07:03.680
you could expect that the
exposures would be highest.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.617
So occupational settings are
clearly one area where people

00:07:07.617 --> 00:07:09.829
might be more heavily exposed.
 

00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:14.130
A couple other human lung
tissue samples that I wanted to

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.740
show you with respect to black
carbon, actually,

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:18.740
only one.
 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.329
So bringing you back to the map
and the concept of the way that

00:07:22.329 --> 00:07:25.685
we understand the air pollution
problem is really driven by

00:07:25.685 --> 00:07:27.250
these dots on this map.
 

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.427
Could be in any state in the
nation and you'd see a similar

00:07:30.427 --> 00:07:33.660
kind of map with the monitoring
stations scattered about.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.334
And in some instances,
they have a concentration where

00:07:37.334 --> 00:07:41.216
they think that the ambient
concentrations are highest so

00:07:41.216 --> 00:07:45.377
that you can see them down along
the southeastern part of the

00:07:45.377 --> 00:07:46.209
coast.
 

00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:48.610
And this is the area that is
out of compliance.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.370
It's a "nonattainment
zone" for both particulate

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.290
matter and ozone.
 

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.916
And also, up in the Hartford
area so that you see a

00:07:55.916 --> 00:07:57.730
collection of monitors.
 

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.978
But also, they are trying to
figure out the variability in

00:08:01.978 --> 00:08:05.644
distribution of pollution,
so they put monitors also in

00:08:05.644 --> 00:08:08.439
parts of the state that are less
densely populated.

00:08:08.439 --> 00:08:12.882
So thinking about this,
a group of us decided that we

00:08:12.882 --> 00:08:18.096
really wanted to understand what
the air was like in the kids'

00:08:18.096 --> 00:08:18.778
day.
 

00:08:18.778 --> 00:08:22.420
So rather than relying on the
reports from these different

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.632
monitoring stations,
what if we took monitors and we

00:08:25.632 --> 00:08:28.947
put them on children and then we
followed them through their

00:08:28.947 --> 00:08:31.906
daily routine,
from the time they left home to

00:08:31.906 --> 00:08:35.548
the time that they came back to
their house after school?

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:40.428
So a group of us,
including David Brown from the

00:08:40.428 --> 00:08:45.620
Centers for Disease Control and
Nancy Alderman,

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.620
who runs a group called
Environment and Human Health,

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.671
Mark Cullen,
Susan Addis,

00:08:48.671 --> 00:08:50.950
the former Commissioner of
Health in Connecticut,

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.094
and Bob LaCamera,
who is a professor of

00:08:53.094 --> 00:08:54.110
pediatrics here.
 

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.346
This was the group that took
this study on,

00:08:57.346 --> 00:09:01.587
along with some technical
analysts at UConn that run the

00:09:01.587 --> 00:09:03.129
EPA testing lab.
 

00:09:03.129 --> 00:09:06.763
So all of the air quality
measurements that are taken in

00:09:06.763 --> 00:09:10.331
the state go through their
laboratory to make sure that

00:09:10.331 --> 00:09:12.379
they're carefully analyzed.
 

00:09:12.379 --> 00:09:16.480
And I also left you with this
chart so that you could keep in

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.582
mind the idea that you've got a
temporal variation in ambient

00:09:20.582 --> 00:09:24.410
outdoor air quality that appears
to be driven and perhaps

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.524
predictable,
not just by month of the year,

00:09:27.524 --> 00:09:29.278
but also by hour of the day.
 

00:09:29.278 --> 00:09:32.070
So what were these monitors
like?

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.570
Here's an example.
 

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:37.416
A gas canister,
a little metal globe that was

00:09:37.416 --> 00:09:42.399
pulling in air at a preset rate,
it had a vacuum in it.

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:45.461
So that we were looking for
about fifty-five different

00:09:45.461 --> 00:09:48.811
volatile organic compounds that
we knew were part of diesel

00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:49.620
emissions.
 

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.533
And by the way,
we weren't really sure whether

00:09:52.533 --> 00:09:56.481
or not the exposure was highest
during the travel to school or

00:09:56.481 --> 00:10:00.365
whether or not their exposure
and their risk would be highest

00:10:00.365 --> 00:10:01.918
within the school.
 

00:10:01.918 --> 00:10:05.182
So we used a variety of
different pieces of equipment

00:10:05.182 --> 00:10:08.886
that could monitor chemicals
that might be more concentrated

00:10:08.886 --> 00:10:11.899
either in traffic or in indoor
environments.

00:10:11.899 --> 00:10:14.445
In indoor environments,
what kinds of chemicals might

00:10:14.445 --> 00:10:15.668
you be concerned about?
 

00:10:15.668 --> 00:10:18.274
Well, it could be,
say, the chemicals in a

00:10:18.274 --> 00:10:21.325
photography laboratory or a
chemistry laboratory,

00:10:21.325 --> 00:10:23.740
such as benzene or other
solvents.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.211
Or it might be other kinds of
cleaning products,

00:10:27.211 --> 00:10:29.278
or it could be pesticides.
 

00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:34.344
So that we tried to figure this
out in a way that would point us

00:10:34.344 --> 00:10:37.558
to the most risky sources of
exposure.

00:10:37.558 --> 00:10:41.373
And with respect to particulate
matter, these carbon particles,

00:10:41.373 --> 00:10:43.710
this was the chart that we
produced.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:48.460
By the way, part of the story
is that this is my daughter when

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.029
she was about twelve years old.
 

00:10:51.029 --> 00:10:54.129
So she was the first guinea pig.
 

00:10:54.129 --> 00:10:58.523
She agreed to carry this BOC
canister, but also she has a

00:10:58.523 --> 00:11:02.210
formaldehyde pump sitting here
on her jacket.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.298
And she's got a particle meter
here to strapped to her belt.

00:11:05.298 --> 00:11:08.649
And she carried an IV cart that
had a carbon monitor,

00:11:08.649 --> 00:11:12.129
an ethylometer that's about the
size of a microwave.

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:15.308
So she walked around with this
thing by her side all day long.

00:11:15.308 --> 00:11:20.240
And as a rather amusing
anecdote on the side,

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.903
when she first stepped on a
bus, all the kids in the back of

00:11:23.903 --> 00:11:27.629
the bus screamed because of our
post-eleven sensitivity about

00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:31.046
what people might look like all
strapped up in technical

00:11:31.046 --> 00:11:32.038
equipment.
 

00:11:32.038 --> 00:11:34.168
The bus driver threw her off
the bus.

00:11:34.168 --> 00:11:36.708
And that's when I realized that
I should have called the

00:11:36.708 --> 00:11:39.110
superintendent and warned them
what we were doing.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:45.168
So here's the outcome of our
initial tests.

00:11:45.168 --> 00:11:49.301
We found that there was a burst
of exposure early in the day to

00:11:49.301 --> 00:11:53.298
PM 10, and also a burst of
exposure at the end of the day.

00:11:53.298 --> 00:11:56.217
But there were also increases
that we saw during the middle of

00:11:56.217 --> 00:11:58.178
the day that really were not
explained.

00:11:58.178 --> 00:12:01.456
And it took us a little while
to figure it out,

00:12:01.456 --> 00:12:05.519
but the kind of particles that
we were measuring varied by

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:07.230
where the child was.
 

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:11.239
So if they're waiting for the
bus or they're on the school

00:12:11.239 --> 00:12:15.320
bus, one could presume that
these were carbon particles.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.168
But if they're just in the gym
moving around,

00:12:18.168 --> 00:12:20.240
these could be dust particles.
 

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.298
So if I had a chalkboard up
here and I could take an eraser

00:12:23.298 --> 00:12:25.250
and just pat it against the
board,

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:28.419
you'd see a cloud of PM 10,
particulate matter ten,

00:12:28.419 --> 00:12:29.798
move up into the air.
 

00:12:29.798 --> 00:12:33.616
The same thing with a gymnasium
where you have say fifty kids

00:12:33.616 --> 00:12:37.178
running around playing
basketball or some other sport.

00:12:37.178 --> 00:12:39.460
You get particles moving into
the air.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.245
So we needed to discern the
carbon particles from other

00:12:42.245 --> 00:12:43.330
kinds of particles.
 

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:48.820
So 600,000 school buses exist
in the United States,

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.650
and we also faced the problem
of trying to figure out whether

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.292
or not exposure during those
high periods early in the day

00:12:56.292 --> 00:12:59.868
and late in the day were the
result of going to school in

00:12:59.868 --> 00:13:03.764
traffic from the buses or were
the particles coming from other

00:13:03.764 --> 00:13:04.850
vehicles?
 

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.600
So I'll tell you a bit more
about that in just a moment.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.961
So here's a very quick summary
of this study that was picked up

00:13:11.961 --> 00:13:14.914
by Good Morning,
America when it was

00:13:14.914 --> 00:13:15.830
released.
 

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:19.535
GMA Host:
But now we turn back to this

00:13:19.535 --> 00:13:20.210
story.
 

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:23.830
Important news for every parent
of children who ride school

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:24.330
buses.
 

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:25.886
Later today,
a new study from Yale

00:13:25.886 --> 00:13:28.940
University will be released,
saying the amount of diesel

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.298
fumes emitted by most school
buses reaches levels that are

00:13:32.298 --> 00:13:35.418
substantially higher than the
government standard.

00:13:35.418 --> 00:13:37.940
And those fumes are going
directly into the air your

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:38.879
children breathe.
 

00:13:38.879 --> 00:13:42.389
Our consumer correspondent Greg
Hunter has an exclusive look at

00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:43.070
the study.
 

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.928
Greg Hunter [on video]:
 Twenty-four million

00:13:46.928 --> 00:13:51.788
children in America ride to and
from school every day on a fleet

00:13:51.788 --> 00:13:54.490
of nearly 600,000 school buses.
 

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.058
Most are powered by diesel fuel.
 

00:13:57.058 --> 00:14:02.976
And each of those children,
on average, spends an estimated

00:14:02.976 --> 00:14:08.179
180 hours every year on board
one of those buses.

00:14:08.179 --> 00:14:12.590
Here's the bad news.
 

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:15.482
According to a new Yale
University study by Professor

00:14:15.482 --> 00:14:18.488
John Wargo, some kids are
getting high levels of diesel

00:14:18.488 --> 00:14:20.379
exhaust from their school bus.
 

00:14:20.379 --> 00:14:24.613
Using ultra-sensitive monitors,
which he placed directly on

00:14:24.613 --> 00:14:27.845
school children,
Wargo took readings of the air

00:14:27.845 --> 00:14:31.168
quality around the children
every minute throughout the

00:14:31.168 --> 00:14:32.460
entire school day.
 

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.711
So you found out exactly what
they were breathing in,

00:14:35.711 --> 00:14:36.899
minute to minute?
 

00:14:36.899 --> 00:14:38.683
John Wargo [on video]:
 Yeah, we mapped it out.

00:14:38.683 --> 00:14:40.298
Actually, every ten seconds we
took a reading.

00:14:40.298 --> 00:14:42.585
Greg Hunter [on video]:
 Wargo's readings showed

00:14:42.585 --> 00:14:45.125
spikes in the measurement of
diesel exhaust at certain points

00:14:45.125 --> 00:14:45.759
of the day.
 

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:49.130
His results differ from those
of the EPA because the EPA

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:52.501
measures air quality at fixed
locations and averages the

00:14:52.501 --> 00:14:54.769
results over a three-year
period.

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:58.499
How much higher than the
government's acceptable level

00:14:58.499 --> 00:15:00.538
were you finding routinely?
 

00:15:00.538 --> 00:15:02.519
John Wargo [on video]:
 Well,

00:15:02.519 --> 00:15:05.090
for short periods of time,
we were finding levels that

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.000
were five to 10 times higher
than the government standard.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.720
Greg Hunter [on video]:
 That's a big spike.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.460
John Wargo [on video]:
 It was a surprise to me.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.972
Greg Hunter [on video]:
 There's no telling exactly

00:15:13.972 --> 00:15:16.486
what exposure to this kind of
diesel exhaust could do to a

00:15:16.486 --> 00:15:18.817
child's health,
but children with asthma,

00:15:18.817 --> 00:15:21.250
like thirteen-year-old Erin
Paternoster,

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.009
say they feel it every time
they get on the bus.

00:15:24.009 --> 00:15:26.900
Did you ever have a time when
you got on the bus feeling great

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.558
and got off the bus feeling
sick?

00:15:28.558 --> 00:15:30.892
Erin Paternoster [on video]:
 Yeah, many times,

00:15:30.892 --> 00:15:33.576
I go on the bus and then I come
off of it and I feel tightness

00:15:33.576 --> 00:15:36.303
in my chest or I can feel like
I'm starting to wheeze or I feel

00:15:36.303 --> 00:15:37.580
like I need my inhaler.
 

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.273
Greg Hunter [on video]:
 Her father,

00:15:39.273 --> 00:15:40.080
John, is outraged.
 

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.032
John Paternoster [on video]:
 I'm not sure you're going

00:15:43.032 --> 00:15:44.918
to find a parent who's going to
say,

00:15:44.918 --> 00:15:46.418
you know, we're--we're doing
something right now that's

00:15:46.418 --> 00:15:48.801
harmful to our children,
let's wait five more years

00:15:48.801 --> 00:15:50.809
before we do anything about it.
 

00:15:50.809 --> 00:15:52.370
Parents won't stand for that.
 

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.182
Greg Hunter [on video]:
 But that's exactly what

00:15:54.182 --> 00:15:54.820
the EPA is doing.
 

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.331
In 2006, they're going to
implement new,

00:15:57.331 --> 00:15:59.909
cleaner standards for all
diesel engines,

00:15:59.909 --> 00:16:01.649
including school buses.
 

00:16:01.649 --> 00:16:04.730
The reason they're implementing
cleaner standards,

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:07.321
in part, they say,
because diesel exhaust is

00:16:07.321 --> 00:16:10.981
likely to cause lung cancer,
and they say the regulations

00:16:10.981 --> 00:16:14.695
will prevent more than 8,000
premature deaths and more than

00:16:14.695 --> 00:16:16.360
300,000 asthma attacks.
 

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.522
Wargo used two devices,
one measured gases like benzene

00:16:20.522 --> 00:16:24.375
and the other measured
ultra-fine particles such as

00:16:24.375 --> 00:16:25.070
soot.
 

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:28.994
Wargo had 15 school children
carry these devices throughout

00:16:28.994 --> 00:16:30.278
their school day.
 

00:16:30.278 --> 00:16:32.831
John Wargo [on video]:
 What we found was in the

00:16:32.831 --> 00:16:35.711
morning, when they got on the
bus, they were exposed to a high

00:16:35.711 --> 00:16:37.129
intensity of particulates.
 

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:40.960
They tended to diminish during
the school day.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.331
And then at the end of the day,
there was another burst to

00:16:43.331 --> 00:16:44.038
their exposure.
 

00:16:44.038 --> 00:16:46.807
Greg Hunter [on video]:
 Wargo also found the level

00:16:46.807 --> 00:16:49.673
of diesel exhaust aboard the
buses was especially high under

00:16:49.673 --> 00:16:52.169
certain conditions,
such as when the buses were

00:16:52.169 --> 00:16:54.289
parked end to end in front of
the school,

00:16:54.289 --> 00:16:56.110
with the engines idling.
 

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:59.320
I can smell the exhaust on the
bus.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.830
John Wargo [on video]:
 Yes, absolutely.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.389
Greg Hunter [on video]:
 So it comes right out--

00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:05.159
The school bus industry says
there's an earlier study

00:17:05.159 --> 00:17:08.355
conducted in a Virginia school
district last March that shows

00:17:08.355 --> 00:17:11.337
breathing the air on Fairfax
County Public Schools' buses

00:17:11.337 --> 00:17:12.828
poses no health risks.
 

00:17:12.828 --> 00:17:14.861
GMA Interviewee:
 Obviously,

00:17:14.861 --> 00:17:17.669
one thing is caution the
parents of the country,

00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:19.759
don't be alarmed at this point.
 

00:17:19.759 --> 00:17:22.934
Let's wait and make sure we
understand everything before we

00:17:22.934 --> 00:17:26.221
make decisions that affect the
health of our children and our

00:17:26.221 --> 00:17:27.588
own health ourselves.
 

00:17:27.588 --> 00:17:28.660
Greg Hunter [on video]:
 Another industry group,

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.528
the Diesel Technology Forum,
argues that the diesel engines

00:17:31.528 --> 00:17:34.397
now being produced are much
cleaner than the diesel engines

00:17:34.397 --> 00:17:36.512
of the past,
and that with proper

00:17:36.512 --> 00:17:40.269
maintenance, diesel school buses
pose no threat to riders.

00:17:40.269 --> 00:17:45.450
The costly process of upgrading
a large bus fleet still poses a

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:49.210
challenge to cash-strapped
public schools,

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:52.838
and even with the cash,
it will still take time.

00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:55.704
Diane Sawyer [on video]:
 Our consumer correspondent

00:17:55.704 --> 00:17:57.038
Greg Hunter joins us now.
 

00:17:57.038 --> 00:17:58.448
So you're a parent,
you see this,

00:17:58.448 --> 00:17:59.900
you want to do something,
what?

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.848
Greg Hunter [on video]:
 One of the best things Dr.

00:18:01.848 --> 00:18:04.142
Wargo says that schools can do,
and they do it in California

00:18:04.142 --> 00:18:06.511
and they do it in states like
Connecticut, is having a no-idle

00:18:06.511 --> 00:18:06.940
policy.
 

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.151
The school bus pulls up,
they cut the engine off and

00:18:09.151 --> 00:18:11.710
that way they're not kicking out
all that diesel exhaust.

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:14.513
Another thing they can do is
stagger the times for the buses

00:18:14.513 --> 00:18:16.290
to come in,
so instead of all of them

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:17.577
pulling up,
the kids getting on,

00:18:17.577 --> 00:18:20.069
and all of them pulling off,
they stagger the times they

00:18:20.069 --> 00:18:22.720
come in and that will help
alleviate the problem.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.663
He says it's going to be kind
of expensive retrofitting some

00:18:25.663 --> 00:18:27.162
of these buses,
five to $6,000,

00:18:27.162 --> 00:18:28.558
it's going to take time.
 

00:18:28.558 --> 00:18:29.849
Diane Sawyer [on video]:
 What's more important?

00:18:29.849 --> 00:18:33.589
Prof: Okay.
 

00:18:33.589 --> 00:18:34.798
A couple of asides.
 

00:18:34.798 --> 00:18:36.835
When we were both standing on
the school bus,

00:18:36.835 --> 00:18:39.240
there was a film crew there
with about six people.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.490
The fumes were-- it was a day
actually like this,

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:44.660
with a high level of humidity.
 

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.180
All of us got sick.
 

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.838
All of us got sick within a
matter of about five minutes.

00:18:48.838 --> 00:18:51.326
And it was curious,
because the consumer

00:18:51.326 --> 00:18:52.983
correspondent,
Greg Hunter,

00:18:52.983 --> 00:18:56.938
he didn't believe that we were
really picking up chemicals that

00:18:56.938 --> 00:18:58.150
were dangers.
 

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:02.009
But after he and the entire
crew felt nauseous and we all

00:19:02.009 --> 00:19:06.076
got headaches because we had
lined the buses up one in front

00:19:06.076 --> 00:19:09.250
of another,
and we the emissions were

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:13.230
basically just building up as
the time went by.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:17.660
He was clearly convinced that
this was a more serious problem.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.880
So I want to take you back to
the averaging issue,

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.181
and remember that there's
twenty-four-hour averaging

00:19:23.181 --> 00:19:26.548
requirement over three years
that's in play with this

00:19:26.548 --> 00:19:27.390
standard.
 

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:31.603
And that was represented by the
graph that I showed you

00:19:31.603 --> 00:19:32.538
yesterday.
 

00:19:32.538 --> 00:19:35.960
If you took the data that we
produced for just one child,

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.482
as an example,
and you average it over one

00:19:39.482 --> 00:19:44.046
hour or over eight hours,
you see that all of the levels

00:19:44.046 --> 00:19:45.338
would be reduced.
 

00:19:45.338 --> 00:19:49.593
So your image of what the
levels were would be down in

00:19:49.593 --> 00:19:52.963
this low range,
missing experiences of much

00:19:52.963 --> 00:19:54.650
higher pollution.
 

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.938
So again, the averaging issue
played out in the way that we

00:19:57.938 --> 00:20:00.828
had to think about different
kinds of strategies.

00:20:00.828 --> 00:20:04.747
The other issue that I wanted
to bring to your attention that

00:20:04.747 --> 00:20:07.618
surprised me was that the amount
of time,

00:20:07.618 --> 00:20:09.737
the amount of exposure,
was far higher than I could

00:20:09.737 --> 00:20:10.328
have imaged.
 

00:20:10.328 --> 00:20:14.338
So this diagram just shows you
that the millions of hours per

00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:17.680
year spent on buses by kids in
different states.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.828
And I want to point to just a
couple of states here.

00:20:19.828 --> 00:20:24.257
New York has the highest amount
of time spent by child hours on

00:20:24.257 --> 00:20:27.665
a bus,
predominately because of the

00:20:27.665 --> 00:20:33.594
rural parts of New York and the
relatively high population in

00:20:33.594 --> 00:20:34.779
New York.
 

00:20:34.779 --> 00:20:36.298
But compare that to California.
 

00:20:36.298 --> 00:20:40.741
California has a little bit
less than half of the hours or

00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:43.470
the total exposure than New
York.

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.380
Now why might that be?
 

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.160
Anybody have an idea?
 

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.420
Sorry?
 

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:57.338
Student: **
Prof: Okay,

00:20:57.338 --> 00:20:59.858
well remember the population of
California is 40 million people,

00:20:59.858 --> 00:21:01.858
so it's a much larger
population than New York.

00:21:01.858 --> 00:21:06.034
And I think that the answer is
likely to be the way that

00:21:06.034 --> 00:21:10.208
residential population and
communities in California are

00:21:10.208 --> 00:21:15.368
more closely clustered together
than they are in New York state.

00:21:15.368 --> 00:21:20.940
So also, what we found that in
places like Idaho,

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:25.285
Wyoming, and Alaska that it's
very common for kids to spend

00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:27.068
two,
three, hours a day on buses,

00:21:27.068 --> 00:21:28.690
as opposed to here in
Connecticut,

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.630
maybe an hour at most,
forty-five minutes to an hour.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:34.419
So the pattern of land use
really was driving the pattern

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:37.058
of exposure that varied quite a
bit state by state.

00:21:37.058 --> 00:21:41.349
And one other aspect of this
that was important was that kids

00:21:41.349 --> 00:21:45.045
that have disabilities,
and they might be disabled for

00:21:45.045 --> 00:21:47.308
a whole array of different
reasons,

00:21:47.308 --> 00:21:50.847
but kids that are disabled are
often bussed to regional

00:21:50.847 --> 00:21:53.298
districts,
regional school systems,

00:21:53.298 --> 00:21:55.828
that have very specialized
expertise.

00:21:55.828 --> 00:21:58.798
So on average,
kids with disabilities that are

00:21:58.798 --> 00:22:02.358
moved around to benefit from the
specialized expertise,

00:22:02.358 --> 00:22:05.460
they experience a higher level
of exposure.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.778
Some kids spend three or four
hours per day going back and

00:22:08.778 --> 00:22:10.990
forth between these control
centers.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:14.603
And I mentioned earlier in the
term that I got a call from a

00:22:14.603 --> 00:22:18.031
woman in Alaska who wondered
about her child who was only

00:22:18.031 --> 00:22:21.829
three years old who she put just
behind the driver's seat.

00:22:21.829 --> 00:22:23.259
She was the driver of the bus.
 

00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:26.682
The child was asthmatic,
and she was having trouble

00:22:26.682 --> 00:22:29.558
controlling the asthma with
medications.

00:22:29.558 --> 00:22:32.384
And she wondered whether or not
the school bus might be a

00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:32.890
problem.
 

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:34.894
So I asked her,
"Well, how long is your

00:22:34.894 --> 00:22:35.640
daily routine?
 

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.650
How long does your child spend
on the bus?"

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:39.130
And it was eight and a half
hours per day.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:43.199
So that thinking about these
high-end exposures and which

00:22:43.199 --> 00:22:47.558
groups in the population might
be susceptible is an important

00:22:47.558 --> 00:22:48.940
aspect of this.
 

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:53.277
So just one other thing that
was interesting in terms of

00:22:53.277 --> 00:22:54.460
study design.
 

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.593
And again, in terms of sampling
strategy, first of all,

00:22:57.593 --> 00:23:00.960
we were monitoring individual
kids and individual buses.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.739
And I just want to reinforce
again the importance of thinking

00:23:04.739 --> 00:23:08.060
about sampling strategy,
and remember the little

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:12.501
200-mile radius from the Nevada
test site when the Atomic Energy

00:23:12.501 --> 00:23:16.450
Commission set up their sampling
design in that way,

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:18.657
and how everybody was fooled
into thinking that those

00:23:18.657 --> 00:23:20.400
particles wouldn't go beyond
that area.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:25.711
There's another defect in
scientific thinking that led to

00:23:25.711 --> 00:23:26.848
confusion.
 

00:23:26.848 --> 00:23:29.673
In this case,
we really didn't understand

00:23:29.673 --> 00:23:33.837
whether or not the level of
pollution that we were measuring

00:23:33.837 --> 00:23:38.731
was coming from inside the bus,
from other traffic,

00:23:38.731 --> 00:23:41.578
or from other sources.
 

00:23:41.578 --> 00:23:45.391
And recall the other day I said
within Connecticut we burn three

00:23:45.391 --> 00:23:48.656
times as much diesel fuel
indoors to heat our buildings

00:23:48.656 --> 00:23:51.380
compared to what's emitted from
vehicles.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:55.505
So it was very important to us
to get a sense of what was

00:23:55.505 --> 00:23:57.788
actually coming out of a bus.
 

00:23:57.788 --> 00:24:01.132
So we set up a separate
experimental bus route in a very

00:24:01.132 --> 00:24:04.230
rural part of Connecticut that
was far away from any

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:07.816
residential unit or any other
source of carbon that we could

00:24:07.816 --> 00:24:10.976
think of other than carbon
that's kind of moving long

00:24:10.976 --> 00:24:13.650
distance and existing at low
levels.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:17.519
So we would look at our meters
and see that the levels were

00:24:17.519 --> 00:24:20.453
close to zero,
and this was reflected also in

00:24:20.453 --> 00:24:22.990
the state's monitoring
facilities.

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:25.490
And then we turned the buses on.
 

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:29.031
And we saw an immediate jump in
the particulate count and also

00:24:29.031 --> 00:24:32.400
in the BOC emissions within the
buses after we did that.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.828
We also saw a couple of
interesting patterns.

00:24:35.828 --> 00:24:37.480
And my daughter,
for example,

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.779
was on a school bus.
 

00:24:38.779 --> 00:24:43.009
She was picked up near my house
and she was taken to school.

00:24:43.009 --> 00:24:45.973
And there's this increase in
concentration,

00:24:45.973 --> 00:24:47.880
which is kind of curious.
 

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.347
And then as she got to a school
where she got off the bus for

00:24:51.347 --> 00:24:54.007
about ten minutes or five
minutes until she was

00:24:54.007 --> 00:24:55.798
transferred to another bus.
 

00:24:55.798 --> 00:24:59.385
She walked about fifty yards
away from the bus and then got

00:24:59.385 --> 00:25:02.663
back on the next bus and it
picked her up and took her

00:25:02.663 --> 00:25:04.210
eventually to school.
 

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:08.522
So this was a pretty good
demonstration that the air

00:25:08.522 --> 00:25:12.920
quality within the bus itself
was a serious source of

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.019
exposure.
 

00:25:14.019 --> 00:25:18.137
We also found kind of curiously
if we looked at kind of the

00:25:18.137 --> 00:25:22.611
horizontal movement and we also
looked at the behavioral pattern

00:25:22.611 --> 00:25:26.872
that we could figure out that
elevation change across a route

00:25:26.872 --> 00:25:30.634
made a difference in the
particle level within the bus

00:25:30.634 --> 00:25:31.630
cabin.
 

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:33.500
So as a bus went uphill,
it's under load,

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:38.373
it produces more pollution,
emissions are quite a bit

00:25:38.373 --> 00:25:43.808
higher both for BOCs as well as
for the small particles.

00:25:43.808 --> 00:25:47.252
In fact, I was coming to work
the other day in traffic,

00:25:47.252 --> 00:25:51.016
and there was a truck next to
me and the truck was using his

00:25:51.016 --> 00:25:52.420
engine as a brake.
 

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.523
So we would accelerate in
traffic, and I was right behind

00:25:55.523 --> 00:25:57.250
this bus,
accelerate in traffic,

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.470
I could see the dark black
smoke coming out,

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.740
meaning the engine is under
load and it's not operating very

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:02.278
efficiently.
 

00:26:02.278 --> 00:26:05.587
And then the traffic in front
of the truck would slow down and

00:26:05.587 --> 00:26:08.028
he would use his engine to brake
the truck.

00:26:08.028 --> 00:26:10.460
It was under load again,
and then you see the black

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:11.528
smoke come up again.
 

00:26:11.528 --> 00:26:14.578
So remember that a cruising
speed at about sixty-five,

00:26:14.578 --> 00:26:17.471
seventy miles an hour is the
most efficient level of

00:26:17.471 --> 00:26:20.250
combustion for most diesel
trucks and vehicles.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:22.641
And by the way,
I don't think I mentioned this

00:26:22.641 --> 00:26:24.767
the other day,
there are about 90 million

00:26:24.767 --> 00:26:27.848
diesel trucks and vehicles in
the United States today.

00:26:27.848 --> 00:26:31.328
So this problem is much bigger
than just the 600,000 school

00:26:31.328 --> 00:26:33.848
buses that I'm looking at in
this study.

00:26:33.848 --> 00:26:37.826
We also found that if we
compared the level of exposure

00:26:37.826 --> 00:26:41.729
to the kids on the bus inside
the cabin to the federal

00:26:41.729 --> 00:26:44.175
standard,
that they were experiencing

00:26:44.175 --> 00:26:46.170
levels that were quite a bit
higher,

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:50.775
sometimes twenty to twenty-five
times higher for short periods

00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:51.529
of time.
 

00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:54.259
And then we found this kind of
a curious thing,

00:26:54.259 --> 00:26:57.936
that an idling vehicle collects
more pollution inside the cabin

00:26:57.936 --> 00:26:59.480
than a moving vehicle.
 

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.218
So there's a ventilation
process that occurs when a

00:27:02.218 --> 00:27:05.732
vehicle moves,
unless the vehicle is moving in

00:27:05.732 --> 00:27:10.566
a train of buses that are coming
into a school or leaving a

00:27:10.566 --> 00:27:11.400
school.
 

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.519
By the way, most vehicles have
no filtration system.

00:27:14.519 --> 00:27:18.919
Most trucks and buses have no
filtration system for the air in

00:27:18.919 --> 00:27:20.288
the indoor cabin.
 

00:27:20.288 --> 00:27:22.368
And by the way,
if you get to the point where

00:27:22.368 --> 00:27:24.900
you want to buy a new car,
I would really encourage you to

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.695
think carefully about the
relative quality of air

00:27:26.695 --> 00:27:27.220
filtration.
 

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.963
There are some vehicles now,
the Japanese vehicles started

00:27:29.963 --> 00:27:31.890
to put filtration equipment in
first,

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:35.468
but it makes a significant
difference to the quality of the

00:27:35.468 --> 00:27:36.269
indoor air.
 

00:27:36.269 --> 00:27:39.394
You can test that in a kind of
an interesting way with respect

00:27:39.394 --> 00:27:40.880
to particulates and carbon.
 

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.131
You can just take your finger,
don't clean your dashboard for

00:27:44.131 --> 00:27:47.099
six months for example,
and then just take your finger

00:27:47.099 --> 00:27:50.169
and wipe it across and you'll
pick up a variety of particles

00:27:50.169 --> 00:27:53.080
that will come in because the
interior cabin is so poorly

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:53.808
filtered.
 

00:27:53.808 --> 00:27:58.017
So this idling issue prompted
us to think well one no brainer

00:27:58.017 --> 00:28:02.294
as a policy response would be to
try to get the bus drivers to

00:28:02.294 --> 00:28:05.798
shut their engines off while
they were idling.

00:28:05.798 --> 00:28:08.890
This was a much harder problem
to crack with respect to trucks.

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:12.700
Because trucks today are
commonly on,

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:17.172
their ignition is switched on
twenty-four hours a day because

00:28:17.172 --> 00:28:21.718
the engine itself is providing
electricity through a generator

00:28:21.718 --> 00:28:23.880
to refrigerate the cargo.
 

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.130
But it's also providing
electricity for the main cabin.

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:30.835
And for some long-distance
haulers, especially independent

00:28:30.835 --> 00:28:34.019
operators, they basically live
in their trucks.

00:28:34.019 --> 00:28:37.359
They will pull over to the side
of a McDonald's and sleep for

00:28:37.359 --> 00:28:38.529
six or eight hours.
 

00:28:38.529 --> 00:28:40.048
Or they'll pull into a trucks
stop,

00:28:40.048 --> 00:28:42.997
and most truck stops are not
equipped with these electronic

00:28:42.997 --> 00:28:46.047
outlets so that they could plug
their truck in and turn their

00:28:46.047 --> 00:28:46.808
engine off.
 

00:28:46.808 --> 00:28:51.019
So they're burning fuel almost
twenty-four hours and idling.

00:28:51.019 --> 00:28:56.395
And the level of emissions are
higher in the engine while it's

00:28:56.395 --> 00:28:57.190
idling.
 

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:00.415
But also, I think that the
truck drivers' exposure is

00:29:00.415 --> 00:29:02.338
really quite a serious issue.
 

00:29:02.338 --> 00:29:06.300
So we also found that the
filtration equipment in these

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.970
buses that were built in year
2000 was so poor,

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:13.316
it virtually was large enough,
the little spaces in the air

00:29:13.316 --> 00:29:16.894
filter were large enough so that
you could stick a pencil point

00:29:16.894 --> 00:29:17.759
through it.
 

00:29:17.759 --> 00:29:21.921
So clearly, it wasn't going to
give any protection at all for

00:29:21.921 --> 00:29:25.390
low-diameter particular matter,
PM 10 or PM 2.5.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:28.578
So there are a variety of
factors here that you can read

00:29:28.578 --> 00:29:31.190
that influence the degree of
concentration.

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:33.507
Whether or not the windows or
open or whether or not they're

00:29:33.507 --> 00:29:34.548
closed,
the engine type,

00:29:34.548 --> 00:29:35.970
the age of the engine in the
bus,

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:41.940
so that older buses are more
polluting than newer buses are.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.442
And one curious thing about
this was whenever I do a study,

00:29:45.442 --> 00:29:48.160
I always assume that I'm going
to get sued.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.309
And I was assuming that the
large diesel manufacturing

00:29:51.309 --> 00:29:54.519
companies were going to give me
a pretty rough ride.

00:29:54.519 --> 00:29:57.318
And I was really quite
surprised, because they wanted

00:29:57.318 --> 00:29:58.450
to promote my work.
 

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:02.200
They were really interested in
having this become very common

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:02.950
knowledge.
 

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.670
And why might that be?
 

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:07.539
Student: Sell new
engines.

00:30:07.539 --> 00:30:08.558
Prof: Sorry?
 

00:30:08.558 --> 00:30:09.558
Student: Sell new
engines.

00:30:09.558 --> 00:30:10.920
Prof: Sell new engines,
that's exactly the answer.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:14.476
They were interested in selling
new engines that would emit

00:30:14.476 --> 00:30:17.848
lower levels of the particles
that we were measuring.

00:30:17.848 --> 00:30:22.357
And put that idea together with
the fact that most trucks have

00:30:22.357 --> 00:30:26.644
an active lifespan of three to
four million miles and often

00:30:26.644 --> 00:30:30.118
thirty to sometimes even
thirty-five years.

00:30:30.118 --> 00:30:33.186
So they were anxious that the
standards be lowered so that

00:30:33.186 --> 00:30:34.910
they could sell more vehicles.
 

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:39.220
So there are a variety of
lessons here.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:42.724
We were also measuring
emissions when the vehicles were

00:30:42.724 --> 00:30:46.359
using a sulfur content in the
fuel that was 500 parts per

00:30:46.359 --> 00:30:47.140
million.
 

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.280
And remember I told you the
other day that now the ultra-low

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.368
sulfur fuels are available and
in use as a requirement,

00:30:53.368 --> 00:30:57.598
completely phased in in the
nation as well as particle traps

00:30:57.598 --> 00:31:01.470
that will take out some of the
compounds of concern.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.762
Now as you're thinking about
this as a policy problem and

00:31:04.762 --> 00:31:08.410
you're thinking about it with
respect to the Clean Air Act,

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.740
you should also think about
different parts of the country

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:15.538
that are either within or out of
compliance with air standards.

00:31:15.538 --> 00:31:20.184
So these exposures that are
being experienced by kids or the

00:31:20.184 --> 00:31:24.516
drivers, they're coming on top
of background air quality

00:31:24.516 --> 00:31:25.538
problems.
 

00:31:25.538 --> 00:31:27.801
In other words,
if you look here in

00:31:27.801 --> 00:31:30.538
Connecticut,
you see that we are,

00:31:30.538 --> 00:31:33.578
the southern part of
Connecticut,

00:31:33.578 --> 00:31:36.477
we are in an orange,
where we're exceeding the

00:31:36.477 --> 00:31:38.279
eight-hour ozone standard.
 

00:31:38.279 --> 00:31:41.894
And we were also,
when we were doing the study,

00:31:41.894 --> 00:31:45.980
exceeding the particulate
matter standard as well.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:50.316
So that on a day like this,
you get many of the particles

00:31:50.316 --> 00:31:52.640
being rained out of the air.
 

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.144
But on a still,
humid day in the middle of the

00:31:55.144 --> 00:31:58.205
summer, you're going to get a
very high level background

00:31:58.205 --> 00:32:00.598
ambient-- it's called ambient
exposure.

00:32:00.598 --> 00:32:05.130
So that these within-the-bus
exposures or,

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:08.848
you can imagine other kinds of
pollutants in your daily life,

00:32:08.848 --> 00:32:11.778
are coming on top of this
background level of exposure.

00:32:11.778 --> 00:32:16.673
I was also quite surprised to
find that diesel particles are

00:32:16.673 --> 00:32:20.240
measurable in any building in
the nation.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:24.032
There's an ambient background
of diesel particles even in this

00:32:24.032 --> 00:32:27.328
room as we were able to discern
just the other day.

00:32:27.328 --> 00:32:30.416
But I can't smell diesel
exhaust in the room today,

00:32:30.416 --> 00:32:33.690
but if you had the latest and
most sensitive detection

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:35.788
equipment, you could smell it.
 

00:32:35.788 --> 00:32:38.338
So we're all experiencing this
background level of exposure.

00:32:38.338 --> 00:32:41.790
So one way of thinking about it
is how many hours on the bus is

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:44.519
going to lead to what kind of a
total exposure?

00:32:44.519 --> 00:32:49.702
And so if the blue here is
representative of the background

00:32:49.702 --> 00:32:53.557
level of exposure,
maybe seventeen,

00:32:53.557 --> 00:32:59.490
eighteen micrograms per cubic
meter of PM 2.5,

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:02.755
then these other bus exposures
in the colored segments are

00:33:02.755 --> 00:33:04.130
coming on top of that.
 

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:06.480
So if you look way over on the
right,

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.098
for a child that's on a bus for
three hours,

00:33:09.098 --> 00:33:13.445
they would be experiencing the
level of pollution that would be

00:33:13.445 --> 00:33:16.038
twice what the federal standard
is.

00:33:16.038 --> 00:33:19.580
So as you're thinking about how
to create a health-protective

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.886
standard,
you need to think about these

00:33:21.886 --> 00:33:25.026
ambient average background
levels that are being picked up

00:33:25.026 --> 00:33:27.778
and measured by the fixed
monitoring equipment.

00:33:27.778 --> 00:33:30.915
But also think about just how
daily behavior leads people to

00:33:30.915 --> 00:33:32.828
be exposed in very different
ways.

00:33:32.828 --> 00:33:37.806
Now, also, it's curious that
the European Union is moving

00:33:37.806 --> 00:33:42.604
much more rapidly to promote
diesel vehicles and diesel

00:33:42.604 --> 00:33:44.965
engines,
predominately to reduce

00:33:44.965 --> 00:33:46.328
CO_2 emissions.
 

00:33:46.328 --> 00:33:50.419
So that diesel now represents
about twenty percent of the

00:33:50.419 --> 00:33:54.102
Europeans' passenger fleet,
whereas in the United States,

00:33:54.102 --> 00:33:56.108
it represents less than three
percent.

00:33:56.108 --> 00:33:59.313
So that it presents a real
dilemma to think through do we

00:33:59.313 --> 00:34:02.915
want to reduce CO_2 or
do we want to be more concerned

00:34:02.915 --> 00:34:06.519
about lowering the level of
exposure to these particulates?

00:34:06.519 --> 00:34:12.730
So these kinds of questions can
lead to policy recommendations.

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:15.800
And for any kind of a problem,
I want to encourage you to

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.652
think about first of all,
what's the right target for

00:34:18.652 --> 00:34:19.639
your proposal?
 

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:22.315
Is it the federal government,
state government,

00:34:22.315 --> 00:34:23.480
local governments?
 

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.797
Would it be voluntary standards
that you might encourage to the

00:34:27.797 --> 00:34:31.070
corporations that manufacture
these products?

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:36.177
Or what could you recommend to
an individual to reduce their

00:34:36.177 --> 00:34:37.650
exposure today?
 

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:39.804
Kind of curiously,
in response to that last

00:34:39.804 --> 00:34:42.338
question,
many parents responded to this

00:34:42.338 --> 00:34:45.726
study that got much more
publicity than it deserved in

00:34:45.726 --> 00:34:48.030
terms of the investment in
money.

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:53.659
This study cost about probably
30 to $35,000 to do.

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:57.253
But people all over the country
stopped driving their kids to

00:34:57.253 --> 00:34:59.050
school, which was a problem.
 

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:03.067
So I had to come up with some
press releases that demonstrated

00:35:03.067 --> 00:35:07.018
that congestion at some schools
was increasing because people

00:35:07.018 --> 00:35:09.849
were not putting their kids on
the bus.

00:35:09.849 --> 00:35:14.360
And it was also increasing the
risk of injury from accidents at

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.380
the schools.
 

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:19.690
So that driving your kids to
school is not the right answer.

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:23.307
You get many more vehicles
arriving at the school,

00:35:23.307 --> 00:35:27.516
creating pollution that would
be higher than what would be

00:35:27.516 --> 00:35:29.289
coming from the bus.
 

00:35:29.289 --> 00:35:32.916
So recommendations to the
federal government,

00:35:32.916 --> 00:35:37.039
retrofit diesel buses to ensure
lower emissions.

00:35:37.039 --> 00:35:38.518
Put particle traps on them.
 

00:35:38.518 --> 00:35:41.880
And as the film segment showed,
that's expensive.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.570
That costs about $6,000 per
vehicle to do.

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:46.550
And it's an important issue.
 

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:49.974
And some of the states and the
federal government have really

00:35:49.974 --> 00:35:51.860
stepped up in response to this.
 

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:53.989
So who's going to pay for this?
 

00:35:53.989 --> 00:35:57.280
Well, it's interesting that so
far,

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.233
I've been keeping track of what
the state expenditures have been

00:36:00.233 --> 00:36:02.577
and what the federal
government's expenditures have

00:36:02.577 --> 00:36:03.000
been.
 

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.376
And right now,
we're close to a half a billion

00:36:06.376 --> 00:36:10.202
dollars that's been spent on
school bus retrofits or

00:36:10.202 --> 00:36:14.284
substituting the lower emitting,
newer engines for the older

00:36:14.284 --> 00:36:14.719
engines.
 

00:36:14.719 --> 00:36:18.400
So that requiring the buses to
use ultra-low sulfur fuel at the

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:22.199
time the study came out was a
really important recommendation.

00:36:22.199 --> 00:36:26.206
Five hundred parts per million
of sulfur as opposed to fifteen

00:36:26.206 --> 00:36:29.030
parts per million of sulfur
produces a much,

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:31.920
much higher level of
particulate matter.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.373
So testing tailpipe emissions,
it's kind of interesting that

00:36:35.373 --> 00:36:38.768
we have to have our cars tested
for tailpipe emissions,

00:36:38.768 --> 00:36:41.219
but trucks and buses generally
do not.

00:36:41.219 --> 00:36:44.130
So that they are exempt.
 

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:48.856
In fact, they can be pulled
over on the highway and they can

00:36:48.856 --> 00:36:52.942
be asked by a Department of
Environmental Protection

00:36:52.942 --> 00:36:57.750
employee working for the state
to turn their engine on,

00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:00.697
and they will hold what's
called a Ringelmann Chart up

00:37:00.697 --> 00:37:03.869
against it that gives them
different levels of opacity.

00:37:03.869 --> 00:37:06.931
And they'll hold that up
against the sky and visually try

00:37:06.931 --> 00:37:10.047
to compare the darkness of the
emissions to their chart to

00:37:10.047 --> 00:37:13.110
figure out whether or not they
think that the truck is in

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:14.039
compliance.
 

00:37:14.039 --> 00:37:16.579
Well, this is not the right way
to go.

00:37:16.579 --> 00:37:20.489
There should be a much more
intense and precise estimate

00:37:20.489 --> 00:37:24.682
that we have the technology
available to conduct those kinds

00:37:24.682 --> 00:37:26.460
of emissions testing.
 

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:30.630
So the other thing to think
here that is important on this

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:33.409
list is that the federal
standards,

00:37:33.409 --> 00:37:36.309
the fifteen micrograms per
cubic meter,

00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:41.434
that is assuming a safe level,
what the safe threshold would

00:37:41.434 --> 00:37:44.909
be with respect to outdoor
pollution,

00:37:44.909 --> 00:37:48.043
not with respect to
within-vehicle pollution or

00:37:48.043 --> 00:37:51.449
other indoor sources being added
on top of that.

00:37:51.449 --> 00:37:54.463
So my belief is that these
federal standards are not health

00:37:54.463 --> 00:37:57.112
protective because they
basically are looking at the

00:37:57.112 --> 00:38:00.282
problem as one source at a time
or just measuring what's going

00:38:00.282 --> 00:38:03.244
on in the outdoor environment
and forgetting that we spend

00:38:03.244 --> 00:38:05.842
ninety percent of our time
either indoors or within

00:38:05.842 --> 00:38:06.829
vehicles.
 

00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:10.949
So we also clearly need to
expand the monitoring network.

00:38:10.949 --> 00:38:14.340
And the idea that we're getting
our image of the intensity of

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:17.447
this kind of a problem by just
relying on fixed monitors

00:38:17.447 --> 00:38:20.070
outdoors,
it really makes little sense.

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:22.831
So putting monitors on
individuals and then following

00:38:22.831 --> 00:38:25.903
through their daily life,
that's going to give you a much

00:38:25.903 --> 00:38:28.971
more accurate representation of
really what your exposure and

00:38:28.971 --> 00:38:29.840
risk might be.
 

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.510
So this is a very expensive
alternative.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:35.010
But it's likely to be the wave
of the future.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:38.746
So a second target for this
study has been state

00:38:38.746 --> 00:38:39.860
governments.
 

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:43.110
So what could state governments
do that the federal government

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:43.909
could not do?
 

00:38:43.909 --> 00:38:47.630
Well, they could prohibit
school bus idling by statute.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:50.219
And in fact,
when this study came out,

00:38:50.219 --> 00:38:53.789
we proposed a law in
Connecticut that would demand a

00:38:53.789 --> 00:38:56.590
maximum of three minutes for
idling.

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.715
And since we did that,
there are twenty-six other

00:38:59.715 --> 00:39:02.449
states that have adopted this
same idea.

00:39:02.449 --> 00:39:04.518
Save fuel as well as reduce
pollution.

00:39:04.518 --> 00:39:07.449
So it's kind of a double-win
situation.

00:39:07.449 --> 00:39:13.670
Also, requiring more buses to
drive shorter distances is

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:17.630
another way of reducing
exposure.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:22.771
So when most school districts,
like we're seeing today with

00:39:22.771 --> 00:39:27.559
respect to declining state
grants and federal grants to

00:39:27.559 --> 00:39:30.639
school districts,
what are they doing?

00:39:30.639 --> 00:39:34.378
They're using fewer buses and
they're putting the kids on the

00:39:34.378 --> 00:39:36.559
buses for longer periods of
time.

00:39:36.559 --> 00:39:38.713
So the routes are actually
going in the wrong direction,

00:39:38.713 --> 00:39:39.889
leading to higher exposures.
 

00:39:39.889 --> 00:39:42.777
And finally,
local governments are really

00:39:42.777 --> 00:39:46.099
responsible for enforcing these
idling bans.

00:39:46.099 --> 00:39:50.431
And we found in a couple of
follow-up studies that there's

00:39:50.431 --> 00:39:54.385
about a fifty-five to
seventy-five percent compliance

00:39:54.385 --> 00:39:57.309
rate for no idling,
particularly at schools.

00:39:57.309 --> 00:40:00.027
When we did the study,
all the buses would pull up and

00:40:00.027 --> 00:40:03.153
they'd idle while the kids got
on the buses or they would idle

00:40:03.153 --> 00:40:05.820
as the kids got off the buses to
go into school.

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.849
But now, it's quite interesting.
 

00:40:07.849 --> 00:40:11.405
The monitors here turned out
not to be people that worked for

00:40:11.405 --> 00:40:13.007
the government,
but instead,

00:40:13.007 --> 00:40:14.429
the school teachers.
 

00:40:14.429 --> 00:40:17.960
Because the school teachers
have long been angry,

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.454
I hadn't understood this,
but they were angry at the way

00:40:20.454 --> 00:40:23.130
that the emissions were making
their way into the school.

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:27.032
And we found that many school
systems had their ventilation

00:40:27.032 --> 00:40:31.068
systems set up so that they were
pulling the air from the bus

00:40:31.068 --> 00:40:33.289
loading area into the school.
 

00:40:33.289 --> 00:40:37.050
And I had one superintendent
tell me that she always knew

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:40.690
when the buses were arriving,
even though she was 250 yards

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:43.465
away from where they were
arriving on the other side of

00:40:43.465 --> 00:40:46.393
the complex because the air
ventilation system was picking

00:40:46.393 --> 00:40:49.579
it up and redistributing it
throughout the entire school.

00:40:49.579 --> 00:40:53.327
So just kind of thinking about
building design as well is

00:40:53.327 --> 00:40:54.130
important.
 

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:58.059
Also, in my own town,
in response to this,

00:40:58.059 --> 00:40:59.550
because we did some of the
testing in the town,

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:02.369
when the town built a new
school two years ago,

00:41:02.369 --> 00:41:04.860
it decided to create a staging
area,

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:07.710
a separate parking facility
where buses could go.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:10.510
And instead of all the buses
training in at the same time or

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:13.375
all leaving at the same time,
they could stagger it,

00:41:13.375 --> 00:41:16.309
so that when one bus is
following another bus,

00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:19.862
it's simply going to be picking
up the exhaust and distributing

00:41:19.862 --> 00:41:20.150
it.
 

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:24.318
So I wanted to give you just a
sense of a couple of kind of air

00:41:24.318 --> 00:41:27.679
quality problems that you may
not have heard of.

00:41:27.679 --> 00:41:29.030
This one was new to me.
 

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:34.248
There was a CNN reporter whose
beat is the Pentagon who called

00:41:34.248 --> 00:41:39.210
me the other day and he said,
"Can you help me out?

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:43.039
Can you help me understand what
the threat is to people in the

00:41:43.039 --> 00:41:45.489
military from open-pit
burning?"

00:41:45.489 --> 00:41:49.536
Open-pit burning of garbage
right now is prohibited in the

00:41:49.536 --> 00:41:52.590
United States,
although many people do it in

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:53.940
their backyard.
 

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:57.405
And open-pit burning is the
primary source of emission of

00:41:57.405 --> 00:41:59.139
dioxins to the atmosphere.
 

00:41:59.139 --> 00:42:03.094
So people on the right-hand
side of this in a barrel will

00:42:03.094 --> 00:42:05.202
stuff their garbage,
their waste,

00:42:05.202 --> 00:42:07.375
into it and just burn it
instead of having to pay for a

00:42:07.375 --> 00:42:08.139
trash collector.
 

00:42:08.139 --> 00:42:11.217
So you might save a hundred
dollars per month if you did

00:42:11.217 --> 00:42:11.610
this.
 

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:16.456
So that what's coming out is a
product of very low-temperature

00:42:16.456 --> 00:42:21.144
combustion which is perfect for
the formation of dioxins and

00:42:21.144 --> 00:42:22.018
furans.
 

00:42:22.018 --> 00:42:24.757
And dioxins,
some of the congeners are known

00:42:24.757 --> 00:42:28.514
to be the most carcinogenic
substances that we are now aware

00:42:28.514 --> 00:42:28.960
of.
 

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:33.018
So that also you could think
about how pollution would kind

00:42:33.018 --> 00:42:37.291
of gather on the surface nearby,
could gather on foods or

00:42:37.291 --> 00:42:40.347
vegetable gardens,
but also kids playing in a

00:42:40.347 --> 00:42:40.880
sandbox.
 

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:44.530
So this is kind of a surprising
source of our exposure to

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:47.400
dioxins that are persistent,
bioaccumulative,

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.768
and carcinogenic.
 

00:42:48.768 --> 00:42:53.516
There is a lawsuit that is
being considered by a group of

00:42:53.516 --> 00:42:58.518
those in the air force that were
responsible for maintaining

00:42:58.518 --> 00:43:00.300
these trash pits.
 

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.610
They were responsible to throw
the garbage in.

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:04.619
And you can imagine what their
exposure would be.

00:43:04.619 --> 00:43:07.679
And what is the primary
component now of most of our

00:43:07.679 --> 00:43:08.159
waste?
 

00:43:08.159 --> 00:43:11.873
Well, it's turning out to be,
in terms of spatial volume

00:43:11.873 --> 00:43:14.641
rather than weight,
it's turning out to be

00:43:14.641 --> 00:43:15.518
plastics.
 

00:43:15.518 --> 00:43:18.344
So plastics when they're
burned, particularly polyvinyl

00:43:18.344 --> 00:43:21.170
chloride, is pretty well
recognized to emit dioxins.

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:24.583
We have another phenomena going
on in response to higher fossil

00:43:24.583 --> 00:43:27.336
fuel prices,
especially in the northern

00:43:27.336 --> 00:43:30.750
latitudes in the country,
and these are would boilers.

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:34.902
People are buying wood boilers
and basically not using their

00:43:34.902 --> 00:43:38.844
furnaces, their natural gas
furnaces or their diesel fuel

00:43:38.844 --> 00:43:39.760
furnaces.
 

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:45.380
So that these burn at a fairly
low temperature and they also

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:51.567
emit a variety of pollutants,
including most of the particles

00:43:51.567 --> 00:43:55.210
in diameters that are quite
small,

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:57.969
just like tobacco smoke or like
diesel emissions.

00:43:57.969 --> 00:44:02.634
And here's just one example of
the effect of one household

00:44:02.634 --> 00:44:04.679
having one wood burner.
 

00:44:04.679 --> 00:44:08.364
And you can see this is
spreading over an area that is

00:44:08.364 --> 00:44:12.188
now at this point in the
photograph, it's about almost a

00:44:12.188 --> 00:44:13.650
half a mile wide.
 

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:16.989
And the concentration of
particulates in this area,

00:44:16.989 --> 00:44:19.597
because I've worked on wood
smoke, if you can see wood smoke

00:44:19.597 --> 00:44:22.302
at this level,
the particulate concentrations

00:44:22.302 --> 00:44:25.951
are likely to be in the many
multiples above that fifteen

00:44:25.951 --> 00:44:27.710
microgram federal limit.
 

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:32.492
So that this is a phenomenon
that is increasing in prevalence

00:44:32.492 --> 00:44:36.320
and leading to really quite
extreme exposures.

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.818
I know this firsthand because I
have a neighbor that installed

00:44:38.818 --> 00:44:39.760
one of these boilers.
 

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.094
And he lives in a valley and I
live on the hill above the

00:44:43.094 --> 00:44:43.630
valley.
 

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:47.039
So every morning when the air
is still because the sun hasn't

00:44:47.039 --> 00:44:50.425
energized the atmosphere,
it builds up in the valley,

00:44:50.425 --> 00:44:52.820
just like you can see in this
case.

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:57.061
It takes the sun to heat the
atmosphere, and basically until

00:44:57.061 --> 00:45:00.010
about nine or ten o'clock,
it elevates.

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:03.202
But our house is filled with
wood smoke from his house,

00:45:03.202 --> 00:45:04.150
as an example.
 

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:08.257
And the compounds in wood smoke
are just as dangerous as the

00:45:08.257 --> 00:45:09.860
compounds in tobacco.
 

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:13.300
You know, one other kind of
idea that a student picked up on

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:16.860
after this lecture a few years
ago was the idea of mapping out

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:20.010
healthy routes for exercise in
urban environments.

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:23.246
I mean, could you think about
what the healthiest route would

00:45:23.246 --> 00:45:26.000
be through New Haven to ride
your bike or to run?

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.190
I mean, you certainly wouldn't
want to run,

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:31.139
say, in New York City within
Central Park,

00:45:31.139 --> 00:45:33.523
where you would have much
higher air quality than you

00:45:33.523 --> 00:45:35.449
would if you ran,
say along the Hudson River

00:45:35.449 --> 00:45:35.800
Parkway.
 

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.268
So could you map out the
healthiest running route?

00:45:39.268 --> 00:45:42.777
And the student did,
putting our particle meters on

00:45:42.777 --> 00:45:43.619
a bicycle.
 

00:45:43.619 --> 00:45:47.465
And one other thing that I'd
like you to think about that

00:45:47.465 --> 00:45:51.585
we're not going to have much
time to consider is the kinds of

00:45:51.585 --> 00:45:56.050
consumer behaviors that can lead
to rather intense exposures.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:59.358
Whether or not it's the plug-in
fragrances, the car air

00:45:59.358 --> 00:46:03.097
fresheners, and when I saw this,
I mean, everybody knows about

00:46:03.097 --> 00:46:03.710
these.
 

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:06.670
But the concept that you're
sitting in traffic and you're

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:09.630
really bothered by diesel
exhaust so you put up a car air

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:12.590
freshener that's emitting
volatile organic compounds that

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:15.920
you may think are more pleasing
than the diesel exhaust,

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:20.050
but they are largely untested,
they're completely unregulated.

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:23.344
Also, the idea of aromatherapy,
not knowing what those

00:46:23.344 --> 00:46:24.340
compounds are.
 

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:28.449
Fragrances, when we talk about
plastics next week,

00:46:28.449 --> 00:46:32.161
we'll find that there are
plasticizers that are hormonally

00:46:32.161 --> 00:46:35.547
active in humans and many
species of mammals that are

00:46:35.547 --> 00:46:39.389
components of some of the most
heavily-used fragrances.

00:46:39.389 --> 00:46:41.429
And also, laundry detergents.
 

00:46:41.429 --> 00:46:44.152
And many people are
experiencing reactions to these

00:46:44.152 --> 00:46:44.860
fragrances.
 

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:47.561
And we're getting them in
mixtures that really are not

00:46:47.561 --> 00:46:48.480
well understood.
 

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:52.626
So I'll leave you with that,
thinking that as you walk

00:46:52.626 --> 00:46:56.313
through your daily life,
think about ways you could

00:46:56.313 --> 00:47:00.130
modify your behavior in a way
that would reduce your exposure.

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:02.260
Thank you very much.
 

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:09.000

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.705
Prof: I learned over the
weekend of the death of Claude

00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:10.440
Lévi-Strauss;
I don't know if you read it in

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.940
the paper or if you know who
Claude Lévi-Strauss was.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.903
Claude Lévi-Strauss,
who was a hundred and one years

00:00:17.903 --> 00:00:20.678
old when he died,
was a great French

00:00:20.678 --> 00:00:24.521
anthropologist,
the founder of the School of

00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:28.700
Structuralism,
though he would never admit to

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.938
that,
as truly remarkable

00:00:30.938 --> 00:00:34.990
intellectual figure of the
twentieth century,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.243
who traveled through the
jungles of Brazil and wrote a

00:00:40.243 --> 00:00:45.200
number of very important
anthropological books,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.717
and one, a memoir,
called Tristes

00:00:47.717 --> 00:00:51.514
Tropiques,
fifty-four, fifty-five,

00:00:51.514 --> 00:00:56.440
which is truly a beautiful,
beautiful book.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:04.319
And I was very moved reading
the obituary in that he said,

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.873
at one point,
that he had learned to pursue

00:01:08.873 --> 00:01:13.972
the truth doggedly,
and also had the idea of

00:01:13.972 --> 00:01:17.930
reviving something from the
past,

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.920
while reading Don
Quixote as a child,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.777
in a children's edition,
obviously translated into

00:01:25.777 --> 00:01:26.670
French.
 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.278
So I thought that I would
mention that beginning the

00:01:33.278 --> 00:01:40.923
class, and also as an homage to
a really great figure of our

00:01:40.923 --> 00:01:41.959
day.
 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:48.394
I have been insisting in my
last few lectures on how

00:01:48.394 --> 00:01:55.209
Cervantes rewrites episodes from
Part I in Part II,

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:59.937
and I want to begin today with
some general statements of this

00:01:59.937 --> 00:02:04.432
theme and a few other general
statements as we approach the

00:02:04.432 --> 00:02:06.060
end of the novel.
 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.370
First, I want to make clear
that not all episodes in Part II

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.699
are modeled after others in Part
I.

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:18.426
There is no antecedent,
really, for the cave of

00:02:18.426 --> 00:02:22.560
Montesinos adventure,
which is the highlight of Part

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.639
II, and perhaps of the whole
book;

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:28.546
nor is there really an
antecedent for the

00:02:28.546 --> 00:02:32.703
Clavileño flight,
so there are a number of

00:02:32.703 --> 00:02:38.279
important episodes in Part II
that are not modeled on episodes

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:39.650
from Part I.
 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.848
You will get to see,
as I announced,

00:02:42.848 --> 00:02:48.513
episodes in Part II that repeat
or rewrite episodes within Part

00:02:48.513 --> 00:02:52.258
II itself, which is very
interesting.

00:02:52.258 --> 00:02:59.056
Second, I want to emphasize
that the rewritings are

00:02:59.056 --> 00:03:04.628
expansions of those episodes in
Part I;

00:03:04.628 --> 00:03:07.461
they are like blowups,
one could say,

00:03:07.461 --> 00:03:10.796
of episodes in Part I;
they tend to have more

00:03:10.796 --> 00:03:14.611
characters, and the actions are
outrageous in comparison to

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.060
their predecessors.
 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.794
For instance,
there is something of the fight

00:03:19.794 --> 00:03:24.889
with the Basque in Don Quixote's
encounter with Sansón

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.389
Carrasco disguised as the Knight
of the Mirrors,

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.699
but the second episode is
richer.

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.983
In the first,
they are both mounted,

00:03:34.983 --> 00:03:36.940
armed, and Don Quixote wins.
 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.949
The same occurs in the second,
but now his opponent is playing

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:43.840
the role of a knight.
 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.753
His outfit reflects Don
Quixote, literally and

00:03:48.753 --> 00:03:53.030
metaphorically,
and the whole set up is

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.360
carefully prepared to resemble a
contest between two knights,

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:07.169
though none of this is present
in the earlier episode.

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:12.236
This expansion or enlargement
is consonant with the

00:04:12.236 --> 00:04:16.899
increasingly Baroque aesthetics
of Part II,

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:22.660
and each instance of a
rewriting is like one more proof

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.454
of it,
one more proof of this Baroque

00:04:26.454 --> 00:04:27.589
aesthetics.
 

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:32.687
Cervantes has not remained the
same in the ten years that have

00:04:32.687 --> 00:04:38.894
elapsed between Parts I and II,
and the old Cervantes is his

00:04:38.894 --> 00:04:43.509
own measure of development,
as it were.

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.910
I don't know if I make myself
clear;

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.754
that is, the Cervantes of Part
I is the measure for his new

00:04:50.754 --> 00:04:52.279
sense of development.
 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:57.189
In the episodes that I will be
discussing today and in

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:01.091
subsequent lectures,
this process of expansion is

00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:03.932
itself expanded,
reaching the limits of

00:05:03.932 --> 00:05:06.689
representation,
which is, again,

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:10.110
also a characteristic of the
Baroque.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.985
I also want to insist on
something that I have only

00:05:15.985 --> 00:05:22.237
hinted at in previous lectures,
and that you may have noticed

00:05:22.237 --> 00:05:26.363
on your own: the increasing
presence of Virgil and his

00:05:26.363 --> 00:05:31.110
Aeneid as we move towards
the end of the second part of

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.980
the Quixote.
 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.624
I will be more specific about
this when we get to meet

00:05:39.624 --> 00:05:42.869
Altisidora,
whom you may have already met

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:45.129
if you have read far enough into
the book,

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:47.970
who is a parody or model after
Dido.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.980
But I just want to mention it,
because the Virgilian

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.779
background may suggest something
important about how Cervantes

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:00.319
conceived Don Quixote in his
second part.

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:05.853
Aeneas is known for his
prudence, for his sense of duty

00:06:05.853 --> 00:06:11.160
from the very beginning,
when he carries Anchises on his

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.110
back as they leave a burning
Troy,

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.129
and when he repeatedly fends
off temptations,

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:24.930
Dido being the most memorable,
so that he can fulfill his

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.485
destiny,
which will be nothing less than

00:06:28.485 --> 00:06:30.199
the founding of Rome.
 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:36.432
Aeneas has the greatest excuse
for leaving a woman in the whole

00:06:36.432 --> 00:06:41.560
of Western literature:
I've got to go found Rome!

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:52.360
Don Quixote cannot aspire to
such a grand design,

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.940
but Cervantes has given him a
different,

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:01.598
no less serious one,
and one that is consonant with

00:07:01.598 --> 00:07:07.750
the age in which he lives,
which is no longer the heroic

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:14.237
age of Virgil's characters,
and that design is to conquer

00:07:14.237 --> 00:07:15.360
himself.
 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.490
This is going to be Don
Quixote's task.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.841
The evolution of the mad Don
Quixote towards sanity and self

00:07:24.841 --> 00:07:29.651
knowledge is the modern
equivalent of Aeneas' prudence

00:07:29.651 --> 00:07:33.279
and task of founding the great
city.

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:38.507
This, it seems to me,
is the overall suggestion in

00:07:38.507 --> 00:07:44.589
these repeated allusions direct
and indirect to Virgil.

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:48.759
Before, of course,
I spoke of Homer,

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:52.300
Ovid and Dante,
and about how Cervantes' field

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.786
of allusions and sources had
moved up from the romances of

00:07:56.786 --> 00:08:00.800
chivalry to the core of the
western tradition,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.101
without abandoning,
of course, the romances of

00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:04.910
chivalry.
 

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:10.379
I also want to emphasize,
and I've already mentioned it,

00:08:10.379 --> 00:08:15.879
that in these episodes that are
rewritings and in these major

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:21.290
episodes in Part II there is a
strong presence of death,

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.660
one way or another.
 

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:27.925
Sometimes, as in the pageant in
the forest, it is the very

00:08:27.925 --> 00:08:32.451
figure of death as an
allegorical figure of death,

00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:35.500
that you, I'm sure,
remember.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.988
This is very much,
again, and I will be

00:08:39.988 --> 00:08:45.067
emphasizing it today in one of
the episodes,

00:08:45.067 --> 00:08:49.320
very much a part of the
Baroque.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:56.335
Before I move on to some of the
truly outrageous episodes that I

00:08:56.335 --> 00:09:00.855
want to discuss today,
let me say something about

00:09:00.855 --> 00:09:04.859
Sancho's letter to his wife and
about the exchange of letters

00:09:04.859 --> 00:09:08.129
that takes place in this section
of the novel.

00:09:08.129 --> 00:09:14.190
Cervantes, who anticipated so
many things in the novel--

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.788
I think I've mentioned before
that García

00:09:15.788 --> 00:09:17.995
Márquez,
the great Columbian writer said

00:09:17.995 --> 00:09:20.932
that everything that novelist
could possibly want to do is

00:09:20.932 --> 00:09:24.380
already in Cervantes--
but Cervantes in these

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:30.080
exchanges of letters is
anticipating epistolary fiction,

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:36.515
the letters to Teresa,
between Teresa and the countess

00:09:36.515 --> 00:09:42.826
and so forth,
there are antecedents in

00:09:42.826 --> 00:09:50.418
Spanish for epistolary fiction,
but here Cervantes,

00:09:50.418 --> 00:09:53.428
in a modern,
already modern novel,

00:09:53.428 --> 00:09:56.710
is anticipating that kind of
fiction.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:02.388
The epistolary novel is one
which the whole novel consists

00:10:02.388 --> 00:10:07.470
of an exchange of letters
between the characters.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.739
As a genre, it became very
popular in the eighteenth

00:10:11.739 --> 00:10:14.541
century,
as I'm sure you know,

00:10:14.541 --> 00:10:19.200
in the works of authors such as
Samuel Richardson,

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.120
with his immensely successful
novels Pamela,

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.918
1740, and Clarissa, 1749.
 

00:10:25.918 --> 00:10:30.085
In France there was the
Lettres persanes by

00:10:30.085 --> 00:10:33.063
Montesquieu,
followed by Julie ou la

00:10:33.063 --> 00:10:35.360
nouvelle
Héloïse,

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.860
by Jean Jacques Rousseau,
and Laclos,

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.529
a novel that I'm sure you have
read,

00:10:42.529 --> 00:10:45.769
if not seen the movie,
Le Liaisons Dangereuses.

00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:49.138
In Germany, Goethe,
The Sorrows of Young

00:10:49.138 --> 00:10:51.705
Werther, and
Hölderlin's

00:10:51.705 --> 00:10:53.308
Hyperion.
 

00:10:53.308 --> 00:10:56.471
So, I mean, what Cervantes is
anticipating here was a very

00:10:56.471 --> 00:10:58.470
popular genre in the next
century.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:05.388
This exchange of letters in
the Quixote also reflects

00:11:05.388 --> 00:11:12.307
a society in which writing has
become a crucial component of

00:11:12.307 --> 00:11:17.780
life,
and communications--of life and

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:24.304
communications,
writing from printed documents

00:11:24.304 --> 00:11:27.360
rival oral exchanges.
 

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.897
If you have been reading your
Elliott you will have learned

00:11:31.897 --> 00:11:35.808
that this is a society obsessed
with documents,

00:11:35.808 --> 00:11:40.524
mostly legal documents,
which is a class to which some

00:11:40.524 --> 00:11:42.658
of the letters belong.
 

00:11:42.658 --> 00:11:49.110
Letter writing is part of the
generation of the production of

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:53.625
legal documents,
so this is a reflection of

00:11:53.625 --> 00:11:55.129
that, too.
 

00:11:55.129 --> 00:12:00.480
It is also, here in the novel,
it is also writing within

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.821
writing,
and the epistles are documents

00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:08.312
not processed into the fiction,
but presented raw,

00:12:08.312 --> 00:12:12.870
as it were, meaning,
it doesn't say Sancho wrote to

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:16.048
Teresa saying this,
and that, and the other;

00:12:16.048 --> 00:12:19.340
no, the document,
presumably as was dictated by

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.201
Sancho--of course,
he doesn't know how to

00:12:22.201 --> 00:12:24.490
write--appears in the novel.
 

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:31.158
Modern fiction will expand on
this device.

00:12:31.158 --> 00:12:33.960
I'm thinking here of Joyce,
of Dos Passos,

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.480
of Cortázar,
and other writers,

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:42.139
whose books contain documents,
such as these letters,

00:12:42.139 --> 00:12:46.330
unabsorbed into the prose of
the fiction.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:53.931
Now, Sancho's letter,
if we want to also look for the

00:12:53.931 --> 00:12:59.587
antecedent in Part I,
is an echo of the one Don

00:12:59.587 --> 00:13:03.370
Quixote wrote to Dulcinea and
that Sancho,

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.129
of course, forgot to take with
him and then memorized,

00:13:06.129 --> 00:13:11.739
and we have all of those funny
episodes in which he tries to

00:13:11.739 --> 00:13:12.879
retell it.
 

00:13:12.879 --> 00:13:18.476
As in the first instance;
that is, as in that episode,

00:13:18.476 --> 00:13:22.908
or those episodes,
the humorous--what is humorous

00:13:22.908 --> 00:13:24.845
here--
is that both Sancho and his

00:13:24.845 --> 00:13:26.929
wife, presumably,
are illiterate,

00:13:26.929 --> 00:13:31.517
so this is an exchange of
letters between characters who

00:13:31.517 --> 00:13:34.519
don't know how to read and
write.

00:13:34.519 --> 00:13:38.981
The whole issue of the
production of the letter and the

00:13:38.981 --> 00:13:44.519
duchess overseeing it and all of
that is part of the humor here,

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:49.360
as the production of the
letter, for Dulcinea was also

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.649
part of the humor in that
episode.

00:13:52.649 --> 00:13:58.182
So now, we do move to these
outrageous episodes that I want

00:13:58.182 --> 00:14:01.969
to discuss today,
and I'm sure when I mention

00:14:01.969 --> 00:14:05.658
what they are you will see why I
use that adjective.

00:14:05.658 --> 00:14:11.528
The first is the episode
involving the afflicted matron,

00:14:11.528 --> 00:14:17.822
known as Countess Trifaldi and
Trifaldín of the White

00:14:17.822 --> 00:14:20.168
Beard, her squire.
 

00:14:20.168 --> 00:14:24.801
This is one of the wildest
inventions of the duke's

00:14:24.801 --> 00:14:29.708
steward, and one of the
strangest in the whole Quixote

00:14:29.708 --> 00:14:33.600
with no possible antecedent in
Part I.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:39.442
That steward is described as
follows in page 705 of your

00:14:39.442 --> 00:14:42.100
translation, by Jarvis.
 

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.220
It says, "The duke had a
steward,

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.210
of a very pleasant and
facetious wit,

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:51.719
who represented Merlin,
and contrived the whole

00:14:51.719 --> 00:14:56.070
apparatus of the late adventure,
composed the verses,

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.759
and made the page act Dulcinea.
 

00:14:58.759 --> 00:15:01.750
And now, with the duke and
duchess's leave,

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:05.455
he prepared another scene,
one of the pleasantest and

00:15:05.455 --> 00:15:08.162
strangest contrivance
imaginable."

00:15:08.162 --> 00:15:09.158
Unquote.
 

00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:15.748
The steward is another internal
author, like Sansón

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:19.100
Carrasco, and Master Peter.
 

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:23.163
In fact, Sansón Carrasco
is one who scripts adventures

00:15:23.163 --> 00:15:25.923
for Don Quixote,
does something that Master

00:15:25.923 --> 00:15:28.591
Peter doesn't do,
but Master Peter is one of the

00:15:28.591 --> 00:15:30.690
authors within the
Quixote.

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:33.350
So the steward not only
organizes the whole pageant,

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:38.190
but also writes the verses as
the quote says,

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:41.340
and plays the role of Merlin,
and then of Trifaldín.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.658
He is as versatile as
Ginés de Pasamonte,

00:15:44.658 --> 00:15:45.789
and even more.
 

00:15:45.789 --> 00:15:49.000
He's a poet.
 

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.144
Now, internal authors,
like him and Sansón

00:15:53.144 --> 00:15:56.390
Carrasco,
in the second part get to put

00:15:56.390 --> 00:16:00.644
into action their creations,
as I have mentioned before,

00:16:00.644 --> 00:16:04.474
and as you have seen,
the results are not exactly

00:16:04.474 --> 00:16:07.575
what they planned,
but they do get to put them

00:16:07.575 --> 00:16:08.298
into action.
 

00:16:08.298 --> 00:16:15.399
The staging of his arrival as
Trifaldín is theatrical

00:16:15.399 --> 00:16:18.889
and Baroque in the extreme.
 

00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:23.123
Again, the intention is to
astonish both with the

00:16:23.123 --> 00:16:27.443
elaborateness of the props,
and with their fearful

00:16:27.443 --> 00:16:30.620
appearance and sounds or noises.
 

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:37.519
So they astonish with the act
of creation.

00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:45.232
I mean, the creator of these
Baroque pranks is boasting of

00:16:45.232 --> 00:16:51.187
his own ability,
and also astonish because of

00:16:51.187 --> 00:16:56.058
the very nature,
size and noise.

00:16:56.058 --> 00:17:03.980
If we go to page 708,709,
I will read the arrival of this

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.162
character:
"And, while they were thus

00:17:08.162 --> 00:17:10.401
in suspense,
they perceived two men enter

00:17:10.401 --> 00:17:12.365
the garden,
clad in mourning robes,

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:15.384
so long and extended,
that they trailed upon the

00:17:15.384 --> 00:17:15.880
ground.
 

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:20.759
They came beating two great
drums, covered also with black.

00:17:20.759 --> 00:17:25.862
By their side came the fife,
black and frightful like the

00:17:25.862 --> 00:17:26.500
rest.
 

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:32.500
These three were followed by a
personage of gigantic stature,

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:37.884
not clad, but mantled about,
with a robe of the blackest

00:17:37.884 --> 00:17:41.644
dye,
the train thereof was of

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:43.950
monstrous length.
 

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:48.278
This robe was girt about with a
broad black belt,

00:17:48.278 --> 00:17:53.146
at which there hung an
immeasurable scimitar in a black

00:17:53.146 --> 00:17:54.318
scabbard.
 

00:17:54.318 --> 00:17:58.185
His face was covered with a
transparent black veil,

00:17:58.185 --> 00:18:02.362
through which appeared a
prodigious long beard as white

00:18:02.362 --> 00:18:03.288
as snow.
 

00:18:03.288 --> 00:18:08.108
He marched to the sound of
drums, with much gravity and

00:18:08.108 --> 00:18:09.180
composure.
 

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:13.608
In short, his huge bulk,
his stateliness,

00:18:13.608 --> 00:18:15.784
his blackness,
and his attendants,

00:18:15.784 --> 00:18:18.608
might very well surprise,
as they did,

00:18:18.608 --> 00:18:22.528
all who beheld him,
and were not in the secret.

00:18:22.528 --> 00:18:25.231
Thus he came,
with the state and appearance

00:18:25.231 --> 00:18:27.999
aforesaid, and kneeled down
before the duke,

00:18:27.999 --> 00:18:30.960
who, with the rest,
received him standing.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.756
But the duke would in nowise
suffer him to speak,

00:18:34.756 --> 00:18:36.180
till he rose up.
 

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:40.468
The monstrous spectre did so,
and, as soon as he was upon his

00:18:40.468 --> 00:18:42.522
feet,
he lifted up his veil,

00:18:42.522 --> 00:18:44.950
and exposed to view the
horridest,

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:48.126
the longest,
whitest and best furnished

00:18:48.126 --> 00:18:51.090
beard,
that human eyes until then had

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.548
ever beheld;
and straight he sent forth is

00:18:54.548 --> 00:18:59.029
broad and ample breast,
a voice grave and sonorous;

00:18:59.029 --> 00:19:02.269
and, fixing his eyes on the
duke, he said..."

00:19:02.269 --> 00:19:06.991
Of course, notice the
preponderance of black,

00:19:06.991 --> 00:19:11.286
and notice that,
as in the pageant in the

00:19:11.286 --> 00:19:15.578
forest, there are many
superlatives.

00:19:15.578 --> 00:19:18.580
Everything is the largest,
the whitest,

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.291
the most horrible,
and the intention is to cause

00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:25.608
admiration and fear on the
spectators.

00:19:25.608 --> 00:19:30.880
Sancho dives into the duchess's
skirts the moment he sees this

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.574
apparition,
as he does whenever he's

00:19:33.574 --> 00:19:36.788
afraid, when he's at the duke
and duchess's house,

00:19:36.788 --> 00:19:40.269
he fainted in her arms in the
pageant in the forest.

00:19:40.269 --> 00:19:46.700
And notice also the figure of
the monster;

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.269
I have spoken about the figure
of the monster before,

00:19:49.269 --> 00:19:55.538
which is not only made up of
the most outrageous features,

00:19:55.538 --> 00:19:59.996
but of contrasting one,
like the black dress and the

00:19:59.996 --> 00:20:01.220
white beard.
 

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.558
The monster is a Baroque figure.
 

00:20:04.558 --> 00:20:08.558
It does not have to be ugly,
just composed of clashing

00:20:08.558 --> 00:20:09.390
features.
 

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:13.328
In Calderón de la Barca,
the playwright that I have

00:20:13.328 --> 00:20:23.712
mentioned several times,
there are beautiful monsters,

00:20:23.712 --> 00:20:35.890
namely beautiful women dressed
as men.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:39.117
So don't confuse this figure of
the monster with the romantic

00:20:39.117 --> 00:20:42.117
Frankenstein,
who is ugly,

00:20:42.117 --> 00:20:50.848
repulsive and sort of a death
warmed over type,

00:20:50.848 --> 00:20:53.150
but this is not the case with
these Baroque monsters.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:58.876
The important thing in the
monster is the clash of

00:20:58.876 --> 00:21:01.750
opposites;
the clashes between the two

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.420
genders, in the case of the
calderonian figures;

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:10.107
we saw that clash in the figure
of the Dulcinea of the pageant

00:21:10.107 --> 00:21:11.598
in the forest.
 

00:21:11.598 --> 00:21:15.903
Such figures are the opposite
of Renaissance harmony,

00:21:15.903 --> 00:21:19.048
but they are,
however, announced in the

00:21:19.048 --> 00:21:21.778
figure of Dorotea,
in Part I.

00:21:21.778 --> 00:21:27.555
And, as in the cave of
Montesinos, and the pageant in

00:21:27.555 --> 00:21:31.325
the forest,
we have a procession,

00:21:31.325 --> 00:21:35.866
a parade of freaks,
and the sound of drums,

00:21:35.866 --> 00:21:40.220
which mark the pace of the
whole ensemble.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:45.828
In these theatrical shows the
characters don't walk,

00:21:45.828 --> 00:21:47.259
they march.
 

00:21:47.259 --> 00:21:51.785
Remember, in the cave of
Montesinos how all of these

00:21:51.785 --> 00:21:56.308
eerie kind of women are marching
in a procession.

00:21:56.308 --> 00:22:00.172
And, of course,
in the pageant in the forest we

00:22:00.172 --> 00:22:04.622
have a huge procession,
parade, so there is no natural

00:22:04.622 --> 00:22:09.491
motion such as walking;
it is marching to the beat of

00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:14.250
the drums and the sounds of the
various instruments.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:19.186
Now, the most remarkable thing
here, of course,

00:22:19.186 --> 00:22:24.017
is the punishment,
within all of this fiction,

00:22:24.017 --> 00:22:29.170
that the dueñas
have suffered.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:33.644
The predicament of the
dueñas is again a

00:22:33.644 --> 00:22:37.950
question of cross-dressing or of
cross-gendering.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:44.037
Their mock affliction seems to
be an excess of testosterone

00:22:44.037 --> 00:22:48.759
that provokes a wild growth of
facial hair.

00:22:48.759 --> 00:22:52.539
Remember that they suddenly,
within this

00:22:52.539 --> 00:22:56.029
fiction--boom!--have these
beards.

00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:59.266
It is described in minute
detail how the hairs are

00:22:59.266 --> 00:23:02.038
supposed to come out of the
pores and...

00:23:02.038 --> 00:23:09.970
this is wild,
Cervantes at his wildest.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:14.148
This is a hilarious condition,
and part of the mockery of

00:23:14.148 --> 00:23:17.210
ladies-in-waiting of the whole
episode.

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:22.825
Sancho's diatribe against them
perhaps reflects an attitude of

00:23:22.825 --> 00:23:23.930
the times.
 

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:28.582
Dueña Rodríguez,
from whom we will hear more

00:23:28.582 --> 00:23:31.440
later, mounts a spirited
defense.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.721
I'm using both
"duenna"

00:23:34.721 --> 00:23:38.414
and "due&amp;nti
lde;a,"

00:23:38.414 --> 00:23:40.568
the Spanish is...
 

00:23:40.568 --> 00:23:45.507
What is used in your
translation is the English

00:23:45.507 --> 00:23:48.618
version "duenna."
 

00:23:48.618 --> 00:23:56.480
Good old Sebastián de
Covarrubias, remember him?

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.069
The great lexicographer who
published in 1611 the Tesoro

00:24:00.069 --> 00:24:03.536
de la lengua castellana and
that I warned you I would

00:24:03.536 --> 00:24:07.374
mention several times during the
semester says the following in

00:24:07.374 --> 00:24:10.284
my own translation defining the
"due&amp;nti

00:24:10.284 --> 00:24:11.769
lde;a."
 

00:24:11.769 --> 00:24:15.259
I'm going through all of this
because I know that this is a

00:24:15.259 --> 00:24:18.990
very strange figure for someone
in the twenty-first century.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:23.653
It says: "In the old
Castilian languages [says good

00:24:23.653 --> 00:24:28.150
old Sebastián]
it meant an old widowed lady.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:32.982
Now, it generally means those
who serve wearing long nunish

00:24:32.982 --> 00:24:36.400
gowns to distinguish them from
virgins.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.463
And in the palaces
â€˜honored

00:24:38.463 --> 00:24:42.141
dueñas' are
principle ladies who are widowed

00:24:42.141 --> 00:24:45.365
and the queens and princesses
keep them near."

00:24:45.365 --> 00:24:46.269
Unquote.
 

00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:49.978
Meanwhile, Webster defines
lady-in-waiting as:

00:24:49.978 --> 00:24:54.757
"A lady of rank who is a
member of the royal household

00:24:54.757 --> 00:24:58.960
and in attendance of a queen or
princess."

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.137
I suppose--this is me now--I
suppose there is a sexual

00:25:03.137 --> 00:25:07.316
connotation to this category of
women because they are

00:25:07.316 --> 00:25:10.470
unattached or presumably
available,

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:13.160
but not young,
unmarried and virginal.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.846
Why so many widows?
 

00:25:14.846 --> 00:25:19.556
I mean, the death--people died
at a younger age in the

00:25:19.556 --> 00:25:23.108
sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries,

00:25:23.108 --> 00:25:28.519
and since men normally live a
shorter life than women,

00:25:28.519 --> 00:25:33.298
even today, there are bound to
be a lot of widows around,

00:25:33.298 --> 00:25:36.299
and, what do you do with these
widows?

00:25:36.299 --> 00:25:40.368
Where do they go in society?
 

00:25:40.368 --> 00:25:44.118
I guess some might go to the
nunnery,

00:25:44.118 --> 00:25:46.233
"Go get thee to the
nunnery,"

00:25:46.233 --> 00:25:50.615
remember Shakespeare,
but others are there in the

00:25:50.615 --> 00:25:53.940
palaces;
they are of rank.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.029
They are a bit like the
segundones,

00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:59.088
the female counterpart of the
segundones,

00:25:59.088 --> 00:26:05.618
but they cannot quite go out
and start a career out at sea,

00:26:05.618 --> 00:26:11.712
or the church,
so they are involved in

00:26:11.712 --> 00:26:19.288
providing or facilitating sexual
encounters;

00:26:19.288 --> 00:26:22.853
they're go-betweens,
they tend to be go-betweens,

00:26:22.853 --> 00:26:26.640
as happens in the story
concocted by the steward.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:35.259
I think that this is the
reason, this sexual sideline of

00:26:35.259 --> 00:26:37.608
these widows.
 

00:26:37.608 --> 00:26:41.058
There are all kinds of jokes
about widows and sexuality,

00:26:41.058 --> 00:26:43.250
and all of that,
and throughout all traditions,

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:50.529
and this is why they are given
in jest a strong masculine

00:26:50.529 --> 00:26:53.786
trait,
a beard, the opposite of the

00:26:53.786 --> 00:26:58.905
role they're supposed to play,
which is very feminine,

00:26:58.905 --> 00:27:00.930
in a sexual way.
 

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:05.970
So the last thing you would
expect them to have is a beard.

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:09.130
 
 

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:12.464
But also, you remember,
from my explanation of

00:27:12.464 --> 00:27:15.875
Dulcinea's hair that,
you know, it meant also a

00:27:15.875 --> 00:27:18.098
certain kind of sexuality.
 

00:27:18.098 --> 00:27:22.618
So, hair, in the case of the
enchanted Dulcinea,

00:27:22.618 --> 00:27:27.568
meant--remember the wench that
had the mole on her face,

00:27:27.568 --> 00:27:30.105
with some hair,
that Don Quixote said she must

00:27:30.105 --> 00:27:32.528
have another one on her thigh
with hair,

00:27:32.528 --> 00:27:35.380
etcetera--it means sexual
proclivity,

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.548
being sexually hot.
 

00:27:38.548 --> 00:27:42.330
These women are to be seen as
sexually active,

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:44.598
but only in a sexual way.
 

00:27:44.598 --> 00:27:48.125
That is, they are not to be
loved and idealized,

00:27:48.125 --> 00:27:52.473
they're only to be seen as
sexual, and this is why the joke

00:27:52.473 --> 00:27:54.650
of having them grow hair.
 

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:57.759
 
 

00:27:57.759 --> 00:28:00.071
Now, the story about the
Countess Trifaldi,

00:28:00.071 --> 00:28:01.887
whom we
encountered--;remember--in

00:28:01.887 --> 00:28:03.098
Spitzer's article.
 

00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:06.970
Remember, the long discussion
by Spitzer about the Tri-faldi,

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:09.358
"tres faldas"
and all of that,

00:28:09.358 --> 00:28:16.660
and how these names are made by
Cervantes.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:21.380
The story about Countess
Trifaldi is very much like that

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.470
of Princess Micomicona in Part
I,

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:28.910
if you remember
that--Dorotea--except that it is

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:30.798
madly exaggerated.
 

00:28:30.798 --> 00:28:38.230
There is a fantastic geography,
outrageously made up names;

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:42.060
it is a meta-meta fiction,
concocted by the characters of

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:46.595
the main fiction,
but here, in contrast to Part

00:28:46.595 --> 00:28:51.180
I, the process is much more
premediated,

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.963
complicated,
and is played out as in a

00:28:54.963 --> 00:28:57.720
theater,
not out on the road.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:01.674
If you remember,
the priest and Dorotea make up

00:29:01.674 --> 00:29:06.662
the story of Micomicona on the
go, and that's why she makes

00:29:06.662 --> 00:29:07.778
mistakes.
 

00:29:07.778 --> 00:29:12.546
Remember, the steward has taken
his time to compose this one,

00:29:12.546 --> 00:29:16.440
it's a whole story very well
wrote, as it were.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:24.759
Maguncia and Archipiela are the
deceased parents.

00:29:24.759 --> 00:29:42.941
Maguncia--they are funny names;
I mean, the first is the German

00:29:42.941 --> 00:29:47.238
town of Mainz,
which sounds very strange to

00:29:47.238 --> 00:29:50.511
the Spanish ear:
Maguncia, Mainz,

00:29:50.511 --> 00:29:53.612
in Germany;
and the second refers to

00:29:53.612 --> 00:29:56.779
"archipelago"
a series of islands.

00:29:56.779 --> 00:30:03.888
These names are geographic in
origin, because the story is

00:30:03.888 --> 00:30:08.130
something of a geographic fable.
 

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:12.903
Candaya is another,
like el reino Micomicón,

00:30:12.903 --> 00:30:15.098
is a made up kingdom.
 

00:30:15.098 --> 00:30:24.260
But, of all of these names,
the funniest is

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:33.858
"Antonomasia,"
the young woman,

00:30:33.858 --> 00:30:39.269
because it is the name that
takes the name of names.

00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:43.690
It's a rhetorical figure,
it names,

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:47.936
Antonomasia,
it is a rhetorical figure to

00:30:47.936 --> 00:30:53.460
name that which is the
quintessence of something,

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:57.614
the "Hercules,"
for a strong man is an

00:30:57.614 --> 00:31:00.987
antonomasia,
The "Hitler,"

00:31:00.987 --> 00:31:04.650
for an evil man,
is an antonomasia:

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:09.828
"From the Greek,
to call by another name the use

00:31:09.828 --> 00:31:14.296
of an epithet of title,
instead of the proper name of a

00:31:14.296 --> 00:31:16.414
person as when [I'm quoting
Webster]

00:31:16.414 --> 00:31:19.259
when his honor is used for a
judge or when,

00:31:19.259 --> 00:31:21.798
instead of Aristotle,
we say 'The Philosopher';

00:31:21.798 --> 00:31:25.375
the use of a proper name,
instead of a common noun as

00:31:25.375 --> 00:31:28.884
when an imminent orator is
called Demosthenes."

00:31:28.884 --> 00:31:29.710
Unquote.
 

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:35.657
It is something like saying par
excellence, the quintessence of

00:31:35.657 --> 00:31:36.808
something.
 

00:31:36.808 --> 00:31:40.759
So why is she called
Antonomasia?

00:31:40.759 --> 00:31:45.731
She is given the name of a
linguistic or rhetorical term

00:31:45.731 --> 00:31:50.974
because she is made up of words:
she's a fiction within the

00:31:50.974 --> 00:31:56.820
fiction made up by the steward,
so she's not to have the name

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:00.348
of a real person,
because she's made up of words.

00:32:00.348 --> 00:32:03.180
This is what this name is
underlining.

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:08.229
Also, she's so named because
she and her story are

00:32:08.229 --> 00:32:12.660
quintessential,
archetypal, common place.

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:27.790
Joaquín Casalduero,
whom I have mentioned before

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:36.664
several times--
Casalduero was a very prominent

00:32:36.664 --> 00:32:40.210
hispanist in the forties and the
fifties;

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:43.509
he was impressed with German
criticism,

00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:47.479
so he named all of his books
"Sentido y forma

00:32:47.479 --> 00:32:50.761
de,"
'sense and meaning of,' Don

00:32:50.761 --> 00:32:53.008
Quixote,
Celestina,

00:32:53.008 --> 00:32:55.963
Novelas Ejemplares,
Sinn und Form it's derived from

00:32:55.963 --> 00:32:57.988
German criticism,
but in spite of that,

00:32:57.988 --> 00:32:59.490
he was a very good critic.
 

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:04.765
And I'm quoting from his book
called Sentido y forma del

00:33:04.765 --> 00:33:07.038
Quixote, of course.
 

00:33:07.038 --> 00:33:11.338
And he says:
"Don Quixote in his purity

00:33:11.338 --> 00:33:16.178
launches forth to disenchant,
to save the lovers and the

00:33:16.178 --> 00:33:19.644
dueñas to make
them recover their original

00:33:19.644 --> 00:33:20.150
form.
 

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:23.275
He fights for the whole of
humanity, which is why the story

00:33:23.275 --> 00:33:25.269
is filled with a sense of the
real.

00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:29.243
Without alluding to anyone in
particular because all are

00:33:29.243 --> 00:33:30.038
involved.
 

00:33:30.038 --> 00:33:32.700
The name of the seduced young
woman is Antonomasia.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:36.048
What he means is that
Antonomasia's name suggests that

00:33:36.048 --> 00:33:39.335
Don Quixote fights for all
seduced and punished young

00:33:39.335 --> 00:33:40.410
ladies."
 

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:46.980
And this is the sense of her
name, the prototypical one.

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:52.450
But, also, since the issue here
is,

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:54.404
one more time,
of marriage,

00:33:54.404 --> 00:33:57.894
unequal marriage,
freedom, social status,

00:33:57.894 --> 00:34:00.835
I think Cervantes,
with this name,

00:34:00.835 --> 00:34:03.670
is perhaps poking fun at
himself,

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:07.210
for repeating the same story
under various guises throughout

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:08.469
the Quixote.
 

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:10.170
He's saying,
well, this one is Antonomasia,

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:13.199
is the prototypical of all of
the stories: Dorotea,

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:15.347
Marcela, and so forth,
that I have been telling and

00:34:15.347 --> 00:34:17.958
I'm telling again,
so I'm making fun of myself by

00:34:17.958 --> 00:34:20.989
giving her this very,
very funny name.

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:25.932
He may also be casting a
resigned and ironic glance at

00:34:25.932 --> 00:34:29.664
human nature for always
repeating itself:

00:34:29.664 --> 00:34:34.793
young women will always be
seduced by charming young men

00:34:34.793 --> 00:34:37.500
and trouble will ensue.
 

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:41.434
This is what a name like
Antonomasia suggests,

00:34:41.434 --> 00:34:41.960
too.
 

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:46.438
The rhetorical name also
reveals that his proxy,

00:34:46.438 --> 00:34:49.487
his stand-in author,
the steward,

00:34:49.487 --> 00:34:51.489
is a learned man.
 

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:55.179
It is, as if we called,
a literary character--

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:58.367
I've been thinking of what
other rhetorical name could we

00:34:58.367 --> 00:35:03.646
give a literary character,
anaphora, for instance,

00:35:03.646 --> 00:35:11.534
anaphora is the figure of
speech by which an orator

00:35:11.534 --> 00:35:17.369
repeats over and again
something,

00:35:17.369 --> 00:35:20.949
as in the case of the
assistant, of Master Peter's

00:35:20.949 --> 00:35:22.686
assistant,
when he says,

00:35:22.686 --> 00:35:25.106
"Look, look,
look," or when the

00:35:25.106 --> 00:35:27.829
preacher says,
"Repent you sinners,"

00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:30.070
and says it over and over
again;

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:31.630
that is anaphora.
 

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:36.438
I don't know if you agree,
you can come up perhaps with

00:35:36.438 --> 00:35:38.219
even a better one.
 

00:35:38.219 --> 00:35:40.635
Synesthesia,
you could call a literary

00:35:40.635 --> 00:35:41.420
character.
 

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:44.400
These are also very good names
if you have a pet to name.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.148
If you have a parrot that
repeats the same thing over and

00:35:48.148 --> 00:35:50.559
over, you could call her
anaphora.

00:35:50.559 --> 00:35:53.510
In any case, just a thought.
 

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:57.072
But it's very funny to have a
character called anaphora,

00:35:57.072 --> 00:36:01.320
is supposed to be very funny;
it's a sophisticated joke.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:06.005
I mean, not everybody knows
what Antonomasia means,

00:36:06.005 --> 00:36:10.130
but it is supposed to be funny,
and it is.

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:20.451
Now, if in Part I we learned to
look for the story behind the

00:36:20.451 --> 00:36:25.635
story,
in Part II we learned how a

00:36:25.635 --> 00:36:30.965
story is made,
and the way that this steward

00:36:30.965 --> 00:36:33.574
appears,
and the way that the story is

00:36:33.574 --> 00:36:35.550
told,
and is presented,

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:39.815
and represented,
is a way of showing the inner

00:36:39.815 --> 00:36:43.793
workings of the story,
so this is one way that we can

00:36:43.793 --> 00:36:45.659
also contrast between the two
parts.

00:36:45.659 --> 00:36:48.896
In Part I, we're looking for
the story behind the story of

00:36:48.896 --> 00:36:50.090
what Cardenio said.
 

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:54.152
Here, we are shown the stage
props, the machinery,

00:36:54.152 --> 00:36:59.130
the stage machinery through
which the story is being made.

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:01.079
Part of it is the name of this
character.

00:37:01.079 --> 00:37:07.210
Now, so to sum up the story
made up by the steward,

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:11.389
Maguncia and Archipiela are the
parents of Princess Antonomasia,

00:37:11.389 --> 00:37:15.554
impregnated by Don Clavijo,
a Don Juan type with the

00:37:15.554 --> 00:37:18.659
connivance of Dueña
Trifaldi.

00:37:18.659 --> 00:37:30.840
Notice that Clavijo is a
phallic name.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:42.889
A "clavija"
is a peg, in a string

00:37:42.889 --> 00:37:46.619
instrument.
 

00:37:46.619 --> 00:37:54.313
Now, they have a little
mechanism with a screw type

00:37:54.313 --> 00:37:56.360
thing,
but the old

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.579
"clavijas,"
the old pegs,

00:37:58.579 --> 00:38:04.570
were simply stuck in by
pressure into the wood,

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:10.500
and hence, the name Clavijo is
a very phallic name;

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:15.119
another joke on the part of
Cervantes.

00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:20.469
Now, Dueña Trifaldi is a
Celestina type.

00:38:20.469 --> 00:38:21.750
Remember?
 

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:26.681
Celestina, the go-between,
1499, who arranges for their

00:38:26.681 --> 00:38:30.576
encounters,
but she falls in love herself

00:38:30.576 --> 00:38:34.496
with a young man,
which gives the story an

00:38:34.496 --> 00:38:38.610
original twist,
a kind of sophisticated twist,

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:42.949
this older woman has fallen in
love with Clavijo,

00:38:42.949 --> 00:38:45.530
who is a very charming guy,
who plays the guitar,

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:46.920
and all of that.
 

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:52.898
It is as if she vicariously had
the affair with Clavijo through

00:38:52.898 --> 00:38:56.570
Antonomasia;
so there is a clever

00:38:56.570 --> 00:39:01.559
sophistication involved in the
story here.

00:39:01.559 --> 00:39:05.139
The steward is a very clever
author.

00:39:05.139 --> 00:39:09.847
Now, Don Clavijo does marry
Antonomasia, as he had promised,

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:14.155
but the queen dies of grief
because of the disparity in

00:39:14.155 --> 00:39:16.550
social class between them.
 

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:19.775
He is merely a knight;
he has the "don"

00:39:19.775 --> 00:39:22.329
so he's a knight,
but she's a princess,

00:39:22.329 --> 00:39:26.070
Antonomasia is the princess,
so Malambruno,

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:30.559
a giant and the queen's first
cousin,

00:39:30.559 --> 00:39:32.460
who is the Pandafilando of this
story,

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:51.219
Malambruno, turns them into the
ornament atop a sarcophagus.

00:39:51.219 --> 00:39:58.500
Now, if Pandafilando--remember,
was the pan-philanderer,

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.190
the one who had many affairs
with women,

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:06.567
pan philanderer,
Malambruno is a bad man:

00:40:06.567 --> 00:40:10.599
from "mal,"
evil,

00:40:10.599 --> 00:40:15.300
or bad, and "hombre,"
man,

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:23.409
or "hombruno," manly.
 

00:40:23.409 --> 00:40:26.769
He's a bad man, Malambruno.
 

00:40:26.769 --> 00:40:28.639
It's also a comical name.
 

00:40:28.639 --> 00:40:37.233
In any case,
this is the gist of the story,

00:40:37.233 --> 00:40:42.157
page 719:
"...upon the queen's

00:40:42.157 --> 00:40:46.125
sepulchre appeared,
mounted on a wooden horse,

00:40:46.125 --> 00:40:49.945
the giant,
Malambruno, her cousin-german,

00:40:49.945 --> 00:40:55.039
who besides being cruel,
is an enchanter also.

00:40:55.039 --> 00:40:57.739
This giant, in revenge for his
cousin's death,

00:40:57.739 --> 00:41:01.250
and in chastisement of the
boldness of Don Clavijo,

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:05.153
and the folly of Antonomasia,
left them both enchanted by his

00:41:05.153 --> 00:41:07.420
art,
upon the very sepulchre;

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:13.581
her converted into a monkey of
brass, and him into a fearful

00:41:13.581 --> 00:41:18.851
crocodile, of an unknown metal;
and between them lies a plate

00:41:18.851 --> 00:41:21.827
of metal likewise,
with letters engraved upon it

00:41:21.827 --> 00:41:24.809
in the Syriac language,
which being rendered into

00:41:24.809 --> 00:41:26.875
Candayan,
and now into Castilian,

00:41:26.875 --> 00:41:30.112
contains this sentence:
'These two presumptuous lovers

00:41:30.112 --> 00:41:32.679
shall not recover their pristine
form,

00:41:32.679 --> 00:41:36.916
till the valorous Manchegan
shall enter into single combat

00:41:36.916 --> 00:41:39.862
with me;
for the destinies reserve this

00:41:39.862 --> 00:41:43.751
unheard-of adventure for his
great valour alone."

00:41:43.751 --> 00:41:44.559
Unquote.
 

00:41:44.559 --> 00:41:49.929
Notice the Baroque suffusing of
love with death.

00:41:49.929 --> 00:41:55.195
The lover's likeness will lie
upon the tomb of the dead

00:41:55.195 --> 00:41:58.119
mother, don't overlook that.
 

00:41:58.119 --> 00:42:05.090
The steward author of the story
is learned as well as clever,

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:08.768
as we found in the pageant of
the forest,

00:42:08.768 --> 00:42:14.750
with all of the Dante allusion,
and in his name of Antonomasia.

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:18.483
Here, he has contrived a truly
Baroque image in the

00:42:18.483 --> 00:42:19.530
sarcophagus.
 

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:24.768
I have given you a handout.
 

00:42:24.768 --> 00:42:29.134
On the one hand,
I could not resist having a

00:42:29.134 --> 00:42:34.309
Doré drawing of the
dueñas,

00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:38.849
as they are supposed to appear
in this episode,

00:42:38.849 --> 00:42:43.018
but on the other I have a
series of sarcophagi,

00:42:43.018 --> 00:42:52.460
because American tombs tend to
be very simple.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:57.086
There is a headstone,
and then the tomb is just the

00:42:57.086 --> 00:43:00.789
grass covering the body or the
casket;

00:43:00.789 --> 00:43:02.699
there's something very
beautiful about it.

00:43:02.699 --> 00:43:07.219
Dust will become dust,
and so forth,

00:43:07.219 --> 00:43:09.929
and so on, but in the European
tradition,

00:43:09.929 --> 00:43:15.389
in the continental tradition,
tombs tend to be much more

00:43:15.389 --> 00:43:20.664
elaborate,
ornate and made of stone or

00:43:20.664 --> 00:43:22.880
hard surfaces.
 

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:26.423
They are like little buildings;
there is a whole architecture

00:43:26.423 --> 00:43:26.949
of tombs.
 

00:43:26.949 --> 00:43:29.768
So, what is a sarcophagus?
 

00:43:29.768 --> 00:43:34.525
Remember the etymology I gave
you when discussing the cave of

00:43:34.525 --> 00:43:37.824
Montesinos episode,
"sarcos"

00:43:37.824 --> 00:43:39.731
in Greek,
"flesh,"

00:43:39.731 --> 00:43:43.125
and "phagein,"
"to eat,"

00:43:43.125 --> 00:43:46.789
so the sarcophagus eats the
flesh of the dead body.

00:43:46.789 --> 00:43:50.835
Sarcophagi were common among
the ancient Greeks and Romans,

00:43:50.835 --> 00:43:52.300
you have some here.
 

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:56.952
It was a limestone coffin or
tomb often inscribed and

00:43:56.952 --> 00:43:59.190
elaborately ornamented.
 

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:03.751
The point of the sarcophagus in
this story is the display and

00:44:03.751 --> 00:44:07.402
the ornamentation,
which are the Baroque elements

00:44:07.402 --> 00:44:10.139
as in the figure of the monster.
 

00:44:10.139 --> 00:44:14.039
Remember that in Montesinos
cave the ornament on

00:44:14.039 --> 00:44:17.940
Durandarte's sarcophagus was his
own cadaver.

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:24.347
The statute is made of flesh;
it was an inversion with nature

00:44:24.347 --> 00:44:26.449
playing the role of art.
 

00:44:26.449 --> 00:44:31.389
Here, we have a much more
elaborate kind of ornamentation.

00:44:31.389 --> 00:44:35.469
How do we interpret the figures
of the monkey and the crocodile

00:44:35.469 --> 00:44:35.929
here?
 

00:44:35.929 --> 00:44:42.795
There are monkeys in Cervantes,
as we saw, with Micomicona,

00:44:42.795 --> 00:44:49.070
and also the monkey that Master
Peter had with him.

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:53.820
As I said when mentioning those
episodes, they allude to

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:58.570
mimesis, to representation,
because they like to imitate

00:44:58.570 --> 00:44:59.518
humans.
 

00:44:59.518 --> 00:45:06.000
Here the ensemble could allude
to lust,

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.730
the croc eats the monkey,
as it were,

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:16.809
but both animals are,
the monkey and the crocodile,

00:45:16.809 --> 00:45:21.380
are supposed to be demonic and
symbols of dissimulation,

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.469
of fakery.
 

00:45:22.469 --> 00:45:25.610
This is why they grace the tomb
of these lovers.

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:29.994
Now, the story of Antonomasia
and Don Clavijo is one of

00:45:29.994 --> 00:45:32.349
consummation and pregnancy.
 

00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:37.552
I think that the pregnancy is
part of the Baroque grotesquerie

00:45:37.552 --> 00:45:40.536
of the episode,
as is the interested

00:45:40.536 --> 00:45:44.289
intervention of the
dueña.

00:45:44.289 --> 00:45:47.471
What I mean by that is that
there is something grotesque

00:45:47.471 --> 00:45:51.471
about the go between,
the older woman falling in love

00:45:51.471 --> 00:45:55.423
with the young man,
and that the same kind of

00:45:55.423 --> 00:45:59.268
grotesqueness is involved in the
pregnancy.

00:45:59.268 --> 00:46:03.090
These contrasts,
you will find in the poetry,

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:04.701
for instance,
of Altisidora,

00:46:04.701 --> 00:46:06.909
when she appears and sings a
song,

00:46:06.909 --> 00:46:10.989
there will be sublime lines
followed by very vulgar ones.

00:46:10.989 --> 00:46:15.407
And this is,
I think, the effect here of the

00:46:15.407 --> 00:46:16.639
pregnancy.
 

00:46:16.639 --> 00:46:20.505
Pregnancy would be unthinkable
in the stories of Part I

00:46:20.505 --> 00:46:24.007
involving Dorotea,
Marcela, Lucinda or Zoraida,

00:46:24.007 --> 00:46:27.650
although consummation did take
place with Dorotea.

00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:34.532
But pregnancy literalizes lust,
removing idealizations about

00:46:34.532 --> 00:46:35.349
love.
 

00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:40.887
It underscores loves functional
biological drive to

00:46:40.887 --> 00:46:42.550
reproduction.
 

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:48.340
Pregnancy is not very sublime.
 

00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:52.659
It's not part of the courtly
love tradition.

00:46:52.659 --> 00:46:59.728
It is unthinkable to imagine
Beatrice, Dante's beloved,

00:46:59.728 --> 00:47:04.309
pregnant, or any of these
ladies.

00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:07.110
So there will be another
pregnancy later,

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:10.119
involving Dueña
Rodriguez's daughter,

00:47:10.119 --> 00:47:12.710
and we will discuss that
episode.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:18.458
At this stage in the
Quixote we are well beyond

00:47:18.458 --> 00:47:24.208
the idealized love of
Grisóstomo and Marcela or

00:47:24.208 --> 00:47:27.679
of Don Quixote and Dulcinea.
 

00:47:27.679 --> 00:47:33.170
Dulcinea has been enchanted
like a country wench.

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:41.110
So now we come to the end of
this adventure,

00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:47.027
the end of this very well
wrought story that the steward

00:47:47.027 --> 00:47:50.762
has composed,
and whose inner workings we are

00:47:50.762 --> 00:47:52.190
observing as we read.
 

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:55.929
We move now to the episode of
Clavileño.

00:47:55.929 --> 00:48:00.601
Clavileño has become
such an engrained name in the

00:48:00.601 --> 00:48:05.773
Spanish tradition that there was
a very famous literary journal

00:48:05.773 --> 00:48:10.780
in the thirties in Spain called
Clavileño.

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:15.677
Now, this story brings to a
close the story of the bearded

00:48:15.677 --> 00:48:20.574
dueñas and the
disenchantment of Antonomasia

00:48:20.574 --> 00:48:21.949
and Clavijo.
 

00:48:21.949 --> 00:48:27.563
Now, first the chapter begins
with a mock tirade of self

00:48:27.563 --> 00:48:33.788
praise on the part of Cervantes
about his narrative techniques

00:48:33.788 --> 00:48:38.300
and characters,
page 720,721:

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:42.041
"In reality and truth,
all who delight in such

00:48:42.041 --> 00:48:45.373
histories as this,
ought to be thankful to its

00:48:45.373 --> 00:48:48.643
original author,
Cid Hamet, for his curious

00:48:48.643 --> 00:48:53.659
exactness in recording the
minutest circumstances thereof,

00:48:53.659 --> 00:48:57.179
without omitting anything how
trifling soever,

00:48:57.179 --> 00:48:59.639
but bringing everything
distinctly to light.

00:48:59.639 --> 00:49:03.253
He paints thoughts,
discovers imaginations,

00:49:03.253 --> 00:49:06.351
answers the silent,
clears up doubts,

00:49:06.351 --> 00:49:09.190
resolves arguments;
and, lastly,

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:13.349
manifests the least atoms of
the most inquisitive desire.

00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:15.610
O most celebrated author!
 

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:17.710
O happy Don Quixote!
 

00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:19.610
O famous Dulcinea!
 

00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:21.789
O facetious Sancho Panza!
 

00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:24.965
Live each jointly and severally
infinite ages,

00:49:24.965 --> 00:49:29.130
for the general pleasure and
pastime of the living."

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:31.659
Now, this is very funny.
 

00:49:31.659 --> 00:49:37.512
Cervantes is praising himself,
and he is praising himself by

00:49:37.512 --> 00:49:41.376
anatomizing,
as it were, the props of his

00:49:41.376 --> 00:49:47.139
own fiction or his own--
the make up of his own art.

00:49:47.139 --> 00:49:51.224
What Cervantes is doing is
dismissing Aristotelian

00:49:51.224 --> 00:49:55.559
injunctions concerning the
writing of history in this

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:56.559
passage.
 

00:49:56.559 --> 00:50:01.302
According to the Philosopher,
to use an antonomasia to refer

00:50:01.302 --> 00:50:04.518
to Aristotle,
history should not concern

00:50:04.518 --> 00:50:07.983
itself with minutia,
but only with that which is

00:50:07.983 --> 00:50:10.360
relevant to the grand
narratives,

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.929
which concern itself with major
historical figures,

00:50:13.929 --> 00:50:17.670
not with characters of the ilk
Cervantes is dealing with,

00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:20.989
nor should history dwell on
their thoughts,

00:50:20.989 --> 00:50:24.864
except when expressed in highly
rhetorical speeches that are

00:50:24.864 --> 00:50:28.409
presumed to express and display
their personalities.

00:50:28.409 --> 00:50:32.356
Now, this is so against our
modern conceptions of history

00:50:32.356 --> 00:50:37.222
that--
and Cervantes is already aware

00:50:37.222 --> 00:50:40.449
of it--
because we do want details

00:50:40.449 --> 00:50:43.436
about characters,
important and non-important

00:50:43.436 --> 00:50:46.597
characters in history,
because we feel that in the

00:50:46.597 --> 00:50:50.295
details you may find the truth,
not in this Renaissance

00:50:50.295 --> 00:50:51.719
conception of history.
 

00:50:51.719 --> 00:50:58.009
What I have just given you is
the core of the Renaissance

00:50:58.009 --> 00:51:02.719
poetics of history,
but in this mock history that

00:51:02.719 --> 00:51:06.581
Cervantes is writing it is
precisely the particular

00:51:06.581 --> 00:51:09.309
details,
as well as the thoughts and

00:51:09.309 --> 00:51:12.710
imaginings of the characters
that are of interest.

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:16.813
The remotest element of this
Renaissance poetics of history

00:51:16.813 --> 00:51:20.431
is the question of the speeches,
because, of course,

00:51:20.431 --> 00:51:23.199
there were no recording devices
at the time,

00:51:23.199 --> 00:51:28.380
so when you hear a king deliver
an oration it is all made up by

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:33.728
the historian whose art involved
the creation of such speeches on

00:51:33.728 --> 00:51:37.489
the part of these historical
characters,

00:51:37.489 --> 00:51:39.239
that would reveal their
personality.

00:51:39.239 --> 00:51:44.349
It was a way of delving into
their psychology.

00:51:44.349 --> 00:51:48.451
Now, I know this is completely
against our notions of how to

00:51:48.451 --> 00:51:51.371
write history,
but this is why Cervantes is

00:51:51.371 --> 00:51:53.039
underlining it here.
 

00:51:53.039 --> 00:51:56.172
He is interested in the
details, and he is interested in

00:51:56.172 --> 00:51:59.644
the imaginings and the thoughts
of characters who are not that

00:51:59.644 --> 00:52:03.005
important,
but are the characters who will

00:52:03.005 --> 00:52:06.079
people the novel that he is
creating.

00:52:06.079 --> 00:52:08.742
So, in other words,
this tirade shows that

00:52:08.742 --> 00:52:12.835
Cervantes is increasingly aware
that he's creating a new kind of

00:52:12.835 --> 00:52:15.847
writing,
which is derived from both

00:52:15.847 --> 00:52:18.594
history and genres,
old and knew,

00:52:18.594 --> 00:52:22.271
such as the epic,
the picaresque and the romances

00:52:22.271 --> 00:52:23.420
of chivalry.
 

00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:26.735
The tirade, by the way,
are to be presumed to be

00:52:26.735 --> 00:52:29.980
uttered by the second author or
translator,

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:32.530
who frequently comments on Cide
Hamete's work,

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:39.710
a historian--remember--who's a
Moor given to prevarications.

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:42.139
So we have all of these folds
and layers of irony still

00:52:42.139 --> 00:52:42.590
present.
 

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:47.423
But this is important,
because of what I said before,

00:52:47.423 --> 00:52:52.630
as stories in Part II
displaying how they are made up.

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:57.268
So we move to Clavileño:
first the name of the horse.

00:52:57.268 --> 00:53:02.655
It is derived from
"clavo,"

00:53:02.655 --> 00:53:10.047
which means a "nail,"
but there is also an echo of

00:53:10.047 --> 00:53:17.690
"clavija,"
the word that I used before,

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:20.010
that I mentioned before in
reference to Don Clavijo,

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:22.500
because the clavija
itself is derived from

00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:25.262
clavo,
meaning something that is

00:53:25.262 --> 00:53:28.820
stuck, and this alludes to the
steering peg,

00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:34.400
or what is being a pilot would
call the yoke,

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:40.434
to steer this horse,
and

00:53:40.434 --> 00:53:54.079
"leño,"
which means wood,

00:53:54.079 --> 00:53:56.119
which is what the horse is made
of,

00:53:56.119 --> 00:53:58.454
but
"leño"

00:53:58.454 --> 00:54:00.719
or
"leña"

00:54:00.719 --> 00:54:04.469
is a kind of wood used for
firewood, for burning.

00:54:04.469 --> 00:54:12.242
The more noble wood used by
carpenters to make furniture or

00:54:12.242 --> 00:54:18.539
cabinets is called
"madera."

00:54:18.539 --> 00:54:22.849
Of course, Cervantes--it's too
unwieldy a word,

00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:26.594
and also Cervantes is
underlining that this wood of

00:54:26.594 --> 00:54:31.090
which Clavileño is made
is not of the noblest wood.

00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:35.161
There is something demeaning to
"leño,"

00:54:35.161 --> 00:54:38.789
Clavileño used to name
Clavileño.

00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:44.152
I kept thinking what would be a
good translation into English or

00:54:44.152 --> 00:54:47.971
a rendering,
I thought that the horse could

00:54:47.971 --> 00:54:51.489
be called Firewood,
or he could be called--or I

00:54:51.489 --> 00:54:53.809
think that the best would be
Woody.

00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:57.742
I think, if we were to really
translate everything in the

00:54:57.742 --> 00:55:00.833
book, Clavileño would be
called Woody,

00:55:00.833 --> 00:55:02.730
as in Woody Woodpecker.
 

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:10.360
But Jarvis wisely sticks to
Clavileño;

00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:14.110
he doesn't translate that,
but that's what the sense of it

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:14.440
is.
 

00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:18.233
Now, the adventure of
Clavileño is derived from

00:55:18.233 --> 00:55:21.670
several similar ones in romances
of chivalry,

00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:26.489
so the parody of romances of
chivalry is carried out now not

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:29.920
so much by Don Quixote and his
actions,

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:32.849
but by the duke's servants,
particularly the steward.

00:55:32.849 --> 00:55:35.449
He's not only learned and
clever, as I have been

00:55:35.449 --> 00:55:37.565
emphasizing,
but he's also a reader of

00:55:37.565 --> 00:55:39.572
romances of chivalry,
and, of course,

00:55:39.572 --> 00:55:41.989
of the first of the
Quixote as well.

00:55:41.989 --> 00:55:46.230
The motif of the flying horse
has a long tradition,

00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:48.469
including Pegasus in Greek
mythology,

00:55:48.469 --> 00:55:53.262
but the figure traveled long in
time in space after the Indian

00:55:53.262 --> 00:55:56.802
and Persian versions,
he appears in the Arabic story

00:55:56.802 --> 00:56:00.219
The Ebony Horse in The
Thousand and One Nights.

00:56:00.219 --> 00:56:06.139
From there, it was disseminated
to France and Spain.

00:56:06.139 --> 00:56:09.938
I won't give you the names of
the titles of some of these

00:56:09.938 --> 00:56:13.806
romances in which appears,
but it is a figure that appears

00:56:13.806 --> 00:56:15.300
fairly frequently.
 

00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:18.875
So, obviously,
this reveals the steward's

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:22.630
knowledge of these romances of
chivalry.

00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:27.594
Now, what is one of the
interesting features of the

00:56:27.594 --> 00:56:32.954
flight is the all encompassing
view from above that the

00:56:32.954 --> 00:56:36.300
characters have,
presumably have,

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:38.980
which is typical of the
Baroque,

00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:42.590
the Baroque effort at all
inclusiveness,

00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:46.599
which is now available with the
knowledge that the earth is

00:56:46.599 --> 00:56:49.018
round and complete within
itself.

00:56:49.018 --> 00:56:53.646
The episode has a great deal to
do with contemporary discoveries

00:56:53.646 --> 00:56:57.099
about the infinite dimensions of
the cosmos,

00:56:57.099 --> 00:57:01.389
about which I've spoken before,
and the inability of Ptolemaic

00:57:01.389 --> 00:57:05.469
and Aristotelian cosmologist to
represent such a cosmos.

00:57:05.469 --> 00:57:11.409
Don Quixote and Sancho believe
to be going through the spheres,

00:57:11.409 --> 00:57:13.559
as described in the whole
cosmology,

00:57:13.559 --> 00:57:16.318
and this, of course,
they encourage this by having

00:57:16.318 --> 00:57:19.018
this fire next to their beards
or their faces;

00:57:19.018 --> 00:57:21.929
so they figure they're going
through the sphere of fire,

00:57:21.929 --> 00:57:27.342
and Sancho claims that he took
a stroll among the

00:57:27.342 --> 00:57:34.110
constellations as they're
described in this old cosmology.

00:57:34.110 --> 00:57:38.994
A corollary of the new
discoveries is that the world is

00:57:38.994 --> 00:57:41.710
one and the same everywhere.
 

00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:48.349
Sancho had introduced the topic
a few pages before,

00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:53.521
when, upon hearing the story of
Antonomasia and Clavijo in

00:57:53.521 --> 00:57:56.148
Candaya,
he says--page 718:

00:57:56.148 --> 00:57:57.144
"What!
 

00:57:57.144 --> 00:58:01.670
Are there court-alguazils,
poets, and roundelays in

00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:03.119
Candaya too?
 

00:58:03.119 --> 00:58:04.998
if so, I swear I think the
world is the same

00:58:04.998 --> 00:58:05.829
everywhere."
 

00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:12.677
Sancho thinks that the world is
the same everywhere,

00:58:12.677 --> 00:58:18.989
and this I what the view from
above suggests.

00:58:18.989 --> 00:58:22.932
Clavileño's flight in
the Quixote is the

00:58:22.932 --> 00:58:26.356
co-relative opposite,
of course, of the cave of

00:58:26.356 --> 00:58:29.110
Montesinos descent down,
up, no?.

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:32.099
Appropriately giving his
increasing importance,

00:58:32.099 --> 00:58:36.000
it is now Sancho who tells the
story like the one Don Quixote

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.469
told after emerging from the
cave.

00:58:38.469 --> 00:58:44.119
He speaks of a celestial flight
drawn from similar flights of

00:58:44.119 --> 00:58:48.170
the spirit that are available in
Cicero,

00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:51.480
Somnium Scipionis,
in Boethius,

00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:53.880
The Consolation of
Philosophy, and even

00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:55.909
in Fray Luis de León's
Still Night,

00:58:55.909 --> 00:58:56.880
Noche Serena.
 

00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:59.507
Fray Luis de León is
another great poet of the

00:58:59.507 --> 00:59:02.135
sixteenth century that is
somewhere in the background

00:59:02.135 --> 00:59:02.590
here.
 

00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:12.474
As in other episodes,
in this second part Don Quixote

00:59:12.474 --> 00:59:23.498
shows real courage before what
appears to be actual danger,

00:59:23.498 --> 00:59:29.052
so does Sancho;
but they have played,

00:59:29.052 --> 00:59:33.960
again, the role of objects of
the other's amusement.

00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:37.215
So the Clavileño episode
is another prank,

00:59:37.215 --> 00:59:39.590
another
"burla."

00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:42.030
It's a word that I keep using,
"burla,"

00:59:42.030 --> 00:59:46.432
prank,
at the expense of Don Quixote

00:59:46.432 --> 00:59:54.440
and Sancho conceived and
executed by the duke's minions,

00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.059
particularly, the steward.
 

00:59:56.059 --> 00:59:59.389
All of these pranks are a
critique of mimesis,

00:59:59.389 --> 01:00:02.639
in that they are literary or
theatrical acts of

01:00:02.639 --> 01:00:06.809
representation which are
presented as pitiable attempts,

01:00:06.809 --> 01:00:09.829
ultimately given up in favor of
humor.

01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:12.942
These are attempts,
literary representation of

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:15.710
mimesis, and the wound up being
funny.

01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:18.744
These, I think,
encapsulate Cervantes' own

01:00:18.744 --> 01:00:21.039
effort in the Quixote.
 

01:00:21.039 --> 01:00:26.666
They are dramatizations of his
plight, an answer to the problem

01:00:26.666 --> 01:00:31.931
trying to represent reality,
coming up with a funny version

01:00:31.931 --> 01:00:32.840
of it.
 

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:36.420
But there is something else,
too;

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:39.943
perhaps even more important in
these pranks and in the

01:00:39.943 --> 01:00:42.469
Clavileño one,
in particular.

01:00:42.469 --> 01:00:46.199
While it is true that Don
Quixote and Sancho are made fun

01:00:46.199 --> 01:00:49.996
of and that they endure hardship
and danger when the whole

01:00:49.996 --> 01:00:54.480
contraption blows up,
it is they who show courage and

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:57.561
determination,
and it is they who do fly in

01:00:57.561 --> 01:01:01.398
their imaginations,
while the pranksters remain

01:01:01.398 --> 01:01:04.103
earth bound,
some, like the duke and

01:01:04.103 --> 01:01:07.664
duchess, astonished and even
frightened by the machinery that

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:09.090
they had constructed.
 

01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:12.021
I think this sums up,
it seems to me,

01:01:12.021 --> 01:01:15.768
Cervantes' attitude towards the
protagonist.

01:01:15.768 --> 01:01:18.594
He may very well be ridiculous
in his efforts,

01:01:18.594 --> 01:01:22.360
but his efforts have a certain
nobleness that others lack.

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:27.972
Just as he emerges unscathed
from the explosion and fall,

01:01:27.972 --> 01:01:31.679
his dignity also remains
untouched.

01:01:31.679 --> 01:01:38.014
In brief, Clavileño does
afford Don Quixote a flight at

01:01:38.014 --> 01:01:40.820
once heroic and inspired.
 

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:46.516
As in the episode of the lions,
I repeat, he has demonstrated

01:01:46.516 --> 01:01:51.739
his courage, even if the context
is not a heroic one.

01:01:51.739 --> 01:01:57.000

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:03.383
Prof: This is
Introduction to New Testament

00:00:03.383 --> 00:00:04.350
History and Literature.
 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.710
My name is Dale Martin.
 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.040
I've been teaching here at Yale
for ten years now.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.012
I also was a grad student here
in the '80s, in the Religious

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:13.070
Studies Department.
 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.465
I then left,
taught one year at Rhodes

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:18.491
College in Memphis,
Tennessee, and then I taught

00:00:18.491 --> 00:00:22.210
eleven years at Duke and got in
love with their basketball team.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.130
But then I came to Yale in 1999.
 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.290
This is a course that
introduces you to the New

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.453
Testament literature,
but also the history of other

00:00:31.453 --> 00:00:34.584
material from the very first one
hundred years or so of early

00:00:34.584 --> 00:00:35.420
Christianity.
 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.249
The first question you need to
ask yourself is why do you want,

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:42.400
or why are you thinking about
taking this course?

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.830
Why do you want to study the
New Testament?

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.710
What is the New Testament and
why should you study it?

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.220
The first obvious answer that a
lot of people would give is,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.493
"Because I'm a
Christian,"

00:00:53.493 --> 00:00:55.530
or "I believe the New
Testament's scripture and,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.395
therefore, I'm here to learn
more about this document that is

00:00:58.395 --> 00:01:00.210
scripture for me in my
church."

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.762
The problem with that answer is
before you say something is

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:06.039
scripture,
you have to say why is it

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:08.170
scripture,
for whom is it scripture,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.590
and what does that mean?
 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.046
And, in Christianity,
when you call the Bible

00:01:12.046 --> 00:01:15.341
scripture, what that means is
that you're going to listen to

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:16.849
it for the Word of God.
 

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:19.462
You're expecting somehow the
Holy Spirit or God to

00:01:19.462 --> 00:01:22.552
communicate to you and to your
church and to your community

00:01:22.552 --> 00:01:23.938
through this document.
 

00:01:23.938 --> 00:01:27.385
But the text of the Bible isn't
scripture in itself,

00:01:27.385 --> 00:01:31.101
it's only scripture to a
community of people who take it

00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:32.250
as scripture.
 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.297
The text itself,
any text, is not itself holy

00:01:35.297 --> 00:01:35.989
writing.
 

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:37.920
That's what scripture means to
us.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.098
It actually just means
"written stuff,"

00:01:40.098 --> 00:01:40.870
from the Latin.
 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.379
But we take it to mean holy
writing, sacred writing.

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:45.379
But the writing itself is not
holy.

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:47.780
It's only holy to people who
take it as holy.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.360
Now the problem is we're at
Yale College.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.250
This is not a holy place.
 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.921
I know they might have told you
that when you came,

00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:57.379
but you've learned differently,
haven't you?

00:01:57.379 --> 00:01:59.500
This is also not a church.
 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.049
So what does it mean to read
the New Testament as scripture

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.819
is not something we're going to
really pursue in this class,

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.239
because this is not a religious
community.

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:09.593
So one of the things that--if
you're here to learn about the

00:02:09.593 --> 00:02:11.188
New Testament because it's
scripture,

00:02:11.188 --> 00:02:14.479
the class may disappoint you,
from that point of view.

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.441
Somebody else might say,
"Oh I'm here because this

00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:20.786
is a foundational document for
Western civilization and I want

00:02:20.786 --> 00:02:23.199
to know something about the
Bible."

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:25.592
There are probably some more
seats over here or some of you,

00:02:25.592 --> 00:02:27.214
if you need to,
can sit on the steps over

00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:27.620
there.
 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.900
If you need to make your way
around--can they get behind you?

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.264
But what does that mean also,
if you say that the Bible is a

00:02:35.264 --> 00:02:38.060
foundational document for
Western civilization?

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.591
Does that mean you can't really
get along in Western

00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:43.419
civilization unless you know
something about the Bible?

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.300
And think about that.
 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.045
Isn't a knowledge of lots of
other things much more important

00:02:49.045 --> 00:02:52.854
for how you get along in Western
civilization than knowing the

00:02:52.854 --> 00:02:53.979
New Testament?
 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:55.574
For example,
it's much more important to

00:02:55.574 --> 00:02:56.310
know about cars.
 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.736
It'd be actually much more
valuable for you to know how to

00:02:58.736 --> 00:03:01.250
fix your car than it is to know
about the New Testament--

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.270
right?--if you're getting along
in Western civilization;

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.423
or how to use computers,
or sexual technique,

00:03:06.423 --> 00:03:08.860
or how to speak other
languages.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.919
There are all kinds of things
that it might be very useful for

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.680
you to know as an inhabitant of
Western civilization;

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.736
and the New Testament,
you might find out,

00:03:16.736 --> 00:03:19.900
would rank kind of down on the
list of those kinds of things.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.979
Besides that--okay,
let's take a quiz first.

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:24.680
Get out a piece of paper.
 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.550
This is your first exam.
 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.378
This'll determine your grade
for the rest of the semester.

00:03:30.378 --> 00:03:33.740
Tell me if this is in the New
Testament, is in the Bible,

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.240
or is not in the Bible.
 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.720
All right?
 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.000
It's just a yes and no question.
 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.389
All you need is ten places to
write yes or no.

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.710
You can even abbreviate and put
Y or N.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.169
First, which of these things
are in the Bible?

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:50.780
The Immaculate Conception?
 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.800
Now you may not know anything
about the Bible.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.922
If you don't know,
just kind of guess,

00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:56.068
just make a guess.
 

00:03:56.068 --> 00:03:58.060
I'm not actually going to grade
these.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.408
Is the Immaculate Conception
something that's in the Bible?

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:04.924
(2) This quotation:
"Love bears all things,

00:04:04.924 --> 00:04:07.691
believes all things,
hopes all things,

00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:09.860
endures all things."
 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.068
Is that quotation in the Bible?
 

00:04:12.068 --> 00:04:14.814
"Love bears all things,
believes all things,

00:04:14.814 --> 00:04:17.389
hopes all things,
endures all things."

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:23.357
(3) At Jesus' birth three wise
men or three kings visited the

00:04:23.357 --> 00:04:24.649
Baby Jesus.
 

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:27.759
Is that in the Bible?
 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:31.173
(4) This quotation:
"From each according to

00:04:31.173 --> 00:04:34.879
his ability, to each according
to his need."

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:38.589
"From each according to
his ability, to each according

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:39.870
to his need."
 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.589
(5) The Doctrine of the Trinity;
is it in the Bible?

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:48.959
(6) This quotation:
"You are Peter,

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:52.000
and upon this rock I will build
my church."

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.680
(7) Peter founded the church in
Rome.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.750
In the Bible, not in the Bible?
 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:00.759
Peter founded the church in
Rome.

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:01.560
Make a guess.
 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.663
(8) After his death,
Jesus appeared to his disciples

00:05:05.663 --> 00:05:06.870
in Jerusalem.
 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.449
Is that in the Bible?
 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:13.110
After his death Jesus appeared
to his disciples in Jerusalem.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.250
No talking with your neighbor.
 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.019
&gt;
 

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:21.752
(9) After his death,
Jesus appeared to his disciples

00:05:21.752 --> 00:05:22.959
in Galilee.
 

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:26.774
After his death,
Jesus appeared to his disciples

00:05:26.774 --> 00:05:27.829
in Galilee.
 

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:33.098
Tenth and Last:
Peter was martyred by being

00:05:33.098 --> 00:05:36.110
crucified upside down.
 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.800
Oh hard one.
 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.699
Okay, let's go back.
 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.240
Number One: Is the Immaculate
Conception in the Bible?

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.579
How many people think so, yes?
 

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:48.620
How many people say no,
it's not in the Bible?

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.389
Somebody tell me what the
Immaculate Conception is.

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.220
Anybody know?
 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.589
Yes?
 

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:55.709
Student:  Mary's
conception.

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:57.120
Prof: Mary's conception.
 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.069
It doesn't refer to the
miraculous conception of Jesus.

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:01.350
That's what often people think.
 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.954
See, one of the things about
this course is you'll learn a

00:06:02.954 --> 00:06:04.250
lot about the Bible and early
Christianity,

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.610
but the most important thing is
you learn cocktail party

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:07.470
conversation tips.
 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.050
&gt;
 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.485
So think about--you really want
to impress that girl you're

00:06:11.485 --> 00:06:11.778
with.
 

00:06:11.778 --> 00:06:14.305
"Hey, did you know that a
lot of people think that the

00:06:14.305 --> 00:06:16.829
Immaculate Conception refers to
the conception of Jesus?

00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:18.889
It doesn't!"
 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:22.208
It refers to the conception of
Mary as being without Original

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:22.540
Sin.
 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.370
Immaculate means "without
stain."

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.110
So it refers to the conception
of Mary, by her mother,

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.202
Anna, without--according to
tradition--without Original Sin

00:06:32.202 --> 00:06:35.216
being transferred to Mary;
and that's because,

00:06:35.216 --> 00:06:37.670
according to Roman Catholic
tradition, then she could

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.360
transmit the birth of Jesus
without Original Sin also.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.480
Now that's not actually in the
Bible.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.379
It's part of Roman Catholic
doctrine.

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:45.810
It's something that Protestants
don't accept.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.639
But a lot of people think it's
one in the Bible,

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:51.473
or a lot of people confuse it
with the Miraculous Conception

00:06:51.473 --> 00:06:53.053
of Jesus,
which is in the Bible,

00:06:53.053 --> 00:06:55.290
in the Gospel of Luke and the
Gospel of Matthew.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.911
Second: "Love bears all
things, believes all things,

00:06:57.911 --> 00:07:00.019
hopes all things,
endures all things."

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:01.480
How many people say it's in the
Bible?

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.009
Can anybody tell me where?
 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:05.230
Come on, there's got to be some
fundies in here.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.459
Student:  1 Corinthians
13.

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:07.740
Prof: 1 Corinthians 13.
 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.860
Good Sunday School education.
 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.569
(3) Three wise men or kings
visited the Baby Jesus.

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:14.939
In the Bible?
 

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:16.990
Not in the Bible?
 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.250
How many people say it's not in
the Bible?

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.660
You say it's not in the Bible.
 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.430
Why?
 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.182
Student:  I guessed.
 

00:07:21.182 --> 00:07:21.629
I have no idea.
 

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:22.689
Prof: You have no idea.
 

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:24.800
It's not in the Bible.
 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.233
It's true that wise men or
kings did visit Jesus in the

00:07:28.233 --> 00:07:31.160
Gospel of Matthew,
but it's only tradition that

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.259
says that it's three of them.
 

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:36.795
Why was the tradition developed
that there were three kings that

00:07:36.795 --> 00:07:38.480
visited the manger of Jesus?
 

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.759
Yes?
 

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:40.639
Student:  The gifts.
 

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:42.552
Prof: The gifts;
there are three gifts:

00:07:42.552 --> 00:07:43.870
gold, frankincense and myrrh.
 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.531
And so tradition just said,
"Well if there are three

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:46.750
gifts, there must be three
kings."

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.949
So that's why we have that.
 

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:48.620
But it's not in the Bible.
 

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.742
This quotation:
"From each according to

00:07:50.742 --> 00:07:53.259
his ability, to each according
to his need."

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:54.610
In the Bible? Raise your hand.
 

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:55.918
Not in the Bible?
 

00:07:55.918 --> 00:07:57.149
Raise you hand.
 

00:07:57.149 --> 00:07:58.310
Ah, couldn't trick you.
 

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.319
Does anybody know where it is
from?

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:00.430
Yes?
 

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.430
Student:  The Communist
Manifesto.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.420
Prof: Yes, Marx.
 

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.680
&gt;
 

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.660
It's from Marx.
 

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.482
But a lot of people hear that
and they think that's from the

00:08:06.482 --> 00:08:06.730
Bible.
 

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.079
The Doctrine of the Trinity.
 

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:09.980
In the Bible?
 

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.670
Not in the Bible?
 

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.521
Okay, why are all you people
saying the Doctrine of the

00:08:14.521 --> 00:08:15.550
Trinity is not in the Bible?
 

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.439
That's usually a real good one.
 

00:08:17.439 --> 00:08:19.473
Somebody explain why the
Doctrine of the Trinity is not

00:08:19.473 --> 00:08:20.040
in the Bible.
 

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.100
You're right,
it's not in the Bible.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.718
Student: I thought it
was thought up by the church to

00:08:23.718 --> 00:08:25.850
explain the paradox of the Son
and the Father.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:26.509
Prof: Exactly.
 

00:08:26.509 --> 00:08:29.391
The Doctrine of the Trinity is
a doctrine that developed

00:08:29.391 --> 00:08:32.221
post-New Testament times to
explain why Christians were

00:08:32.221 --> 00:08:35.210
worshipping Jesus and the Holy
Spirit also as divine.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.400
So the Doctrine of the Trinity
developed in the later

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.960
centuries, after the New
Testament.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.638
Now some people will say at
least the Doctrine of the

00:08:41.638 --> 00:08:44.625
Trinity is hinted at in the
Bible and that the later church

00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:47.509
was correct to read the New
Testament to support it.

00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:49.155
And that may well be right
theologically,

00:08:49.155 --> 00:08:51.048
but read historically it's not
in the Bible.

00:08:51.048 --> 00:08:53.808
"You are Peter and upon
this rock I will build my

00:08:53.808 --> 00:08:54.590
church."
 

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.220
How many people say it's in the
Bible?

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.620
How many people say it's not in
the Bible?

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.009
It's in the Bible.
 

00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:03.428
It's in Matthew 16.
 

00:09:03.428 --> 00:09:06.259
(7) Peter founded the church in
Rome.

00:09:06.259 --> 00:09:07.110
Is it in the Bible?
 

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.860
You all aren't sure.
 

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:09.918
Is it not in the Bible?
 

00:09:09.918 --> 00:09:11.668
Ah, more people say it's not in
the Bible.

00:09:11.668 --> 00:09:12.909
You're right,
it's not in the Bible.

00:09:12.909 --> 00:09:14.320
It's part of tradition.
 

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.068
It's a very strong part of
Christian tradition but it's not

00:09:17.068 --> 00:09:17.778
in the Bible.
 

00:09:17.778 --> 00:09:19.947
After his death,
Jesus appeared to his disciples

00:09:19.947 --> 00:09:20.639
in Jerusalem.
 

00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:21.549
In the Bible?
 

00:09:21.549 --> 00:09:22.740
Raise your hand.
 

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.500
A few people.
 

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.668
Not in the Bible?
 

00:09:24.668 --> 00:09:27.009
You're wrong,
it is in the Bible.

00:09:27.009 --> 00:09:29.879
It's in the Gospel of Luke and
Acts.

00:09:29.879 --> 00:09:31.979
After his death,
Jesus appeared to his disciples

00:09:31.979 --> 00:09:32.559
in Galilee.
 

00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:33.220
Is that in the Bible?
 

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.039
Yes, some of you say yes.
 

00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:35.840
Not in the Bible?
 

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.309
Anybody who's brave enough to
say it's not in the Bible?

00:09:37.309 --> 00:09:38.710
It is in the Bible.
 

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.879
It's in the Gospel of Matthew.
 

00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:42.769
But now notice,
the Gospel of Matthew,

00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:45.476
as we'll talk about later,
has Jesus appear to his

00:09:45.476 --> 00:09:48.107
disciples only in Galilee,
not in Judea,

00:09:48.107 --> 00:09:52.460
and the Gospel of Luke and Acts
have Jesus appear to his

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.100
disciples only in Judea but not
in Galilee.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.322
Ah, that's an interesting
problem we will have to get to

00:09:59.322 --> 00:10:00.259
at some point.
 

00:10:00.259 --> 00:10:02.899
Tenth and last:
Peter was martyred by being

00:10:02.899 --> 00:10:04.408
crucified upside down.
 

00:10:04.408 --> 00:10:06.629
In the Bible or not in the
Bible?

00:10:06.629 --> 00:10:07.320
In the Bible?
 

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.960
Not in the Bible?
 

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.471
The not-in-the-Bibles have it;
it's not in the Bible,

00:10:11.471 --> 00:10:13.778
but it's a very important part
of Christian tradition.

00:10:13.778 --> 00:10:16.777
Now I did the little
quiz--these are all things that

00:10:16.777 --> 00:10:19.070
a lot of people out there would
say,

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.009
"Oh yeah,
that's in the Bible,

00:10:20.009 --> 00:10:21.388
or it sounds like something
that should be in the

00:10:21.388 --> 00:10:21.789
Bible."
 

00:10:21.789 --> 00:10:22.620
Right?
 

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.756
Most of them aren't,
or about half of them,

00:10:24.756 --> 00:10:27.809
I think, are not in the Bible,
and yet they're very important

00:10:27.809 --> 00:10:30.048
for the history of Western
Civilization.

00:10:30.048 --> 00:10:31.570
They're important for people's
conceptions.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.418
They're important for the
history of art.

00:10:33.418 --> 00:10:37.077
How many paintings are there of
Peter crucified upside down,

00:10:37.077 --> 00:10:39.000
or depictions in Western Art?
 

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.827
So it's very important for
someone to know that there is an

00:10:41.827 --> 00:10:44.899
important tradition about Peter
being crucified upside down,

00:10:44.899 --> 00:10:46.730
but it's not a part of the New
Testament.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:51.461
It illustrates again this idea
that how much of this ancient

00:10:51.461 --> 00:10:54.668
text is it important for you to
know,

00:10:54.668 --> 00:10:56.980
on its own terms,
in its historical context in

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.610
the first century,
or how is it important for you

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.553
to know in the way it's been
interpreted for the last 2000

00:11:02.553 --> 00:11:03.019
years?
 

00:11:03.019 --> 00:11:06.043
And what I am telling you is
kind of contrary to the way I'm

00:11:06.043 --> 00:11:07.528
going to teach this course.
 

00:11:07.528 --> 00:11:09.594
I'm actually advertising
against myself,

00:11:09.594 --> 00:11:11.870
and there'll be fewer of you
here next time,

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:12.399
right?
 

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:14.000
Contrary to the way I'll teach
this course,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.520
which is more on the history of
the first century of these

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.908
documents and what they meant in
the first century,

00:11:18.908 --> 00:11:22.100
sometimes the most important
thing about the Bible is its

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.808
impact on the later history.
 

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:26.389
And that's something that we'll
talk about from time to time in

00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:28.062
the class,
but it's something you'd get

00:11:28.062 --> 00:11:29.374
more out of,
for example,

00:11:29.374 --> 00:11:31.730
if you studied an art history
class,

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.249
or if you studied a literature
class that talked about some of

00:11:35.249 --> 00:11:37.500
these issues in later European
times.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.490
I could illustrate with a lot
more other things.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.432
For example,
if I said, "What do most

00:11:41.432 --> 00:11:43.898
people believe about what
happens to you after you're

00:11:43.898 --> 00:11:44.610
dead?"
 

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:46.340
And you'd get lots of different
answers.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.928
"You're dead like Rover,
you're dead all over."

00:11:47.928 --> 00:11:49.639
Some people say,
"You go to heaven."

00:11:49.639 --> 00:11:51.379
Some people--there's all kinds
of different things.

00:11:51.379 --> 00:11:54.460
If I said, "What do you
think most Christian religious

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.222
people believe about what
happens to you after you're

00:11:57.222 --> 00:11:58.019
dead?"
 

00:11:58.019 --> 00:11:59.903
In other words,
"Where is Aunt Martha at

00:11:59.903 --> 00:12:00.759
the funeral?"
 

00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:02.940
"Well she's up with the
arms of Jesus.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.370
She's safe in heaven.
 

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.500
Her soul is there."
 

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.481
Most people would say that
Christians or religious people

00:12:08.481 --> 00:12:10.720
believe in the immortality of
the soul,

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.610
and that is part of a good bit
of Christian doctrine.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.572
That again is not something
that's in the Bible,

00:12:16.572 --> 00:12:20.038
really, so--and it's not even
the best interpretation of

00:12:20.038 --> 00:12:22.120
official Christian orthodoxy.
 

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.998
According to official Christian
orthodoxy, the form of your

00:12:25.998 --> 00:12:29.610
afterlife existence is the
resurrection of the body.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.922
That's what the New Testament
talks about, either the

00:12:31.922 --> 00:12:34.590
resurrection of the flesh or the
resurrection of the body.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:37.624
That's contrary to what most
people kind of assume is what

00:12:37.624 --> 00:12:38.529
people believe.
 

00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:41.173
The point about this--and where
do they get the idea of the

00:12:41.173 --> 00:12:42.360
immortality of the soul?
 

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.639
Much more from Plato.
 

00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:46.629
So again it raises the issue,
if you want to know most about

00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:49.519
the most influential aspects for
Western civilization,

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:53.496
would it be better for you to
take an entire semester on Plato

00:12:53.496 --> 00:12:55.909
than it would on the New
Testament?

00:12:55.909 --> 00:12:58.788
I'm saying it might, actually.
 

00:12:58.788 --> 00:13:01.249
The ironic fact is,
because the New Testament is

00:13:01.249 --> 00:13:03.288
considered more important by
people,

00:13:03.288 --> 00:13:05.785
there are a whole lot more
people who take my New Testament

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:08.239
classes than go over to the
Classics Department and take a

00:13:08.239 --> 00:13:09.100
course in Plato.
 

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.301
I'm not sure that's the way it
should be, but that's the way it

00:13:12.301 --> 00:13:12.558
is.
 

00:13:12.558 --> 00:13:15.633
What this does is it brings up
this issue of why are you here,

00:13:15.633 --> 00:13:17.899
what do you hope to get out of
this course?

00:13:17.899 --> 00:13:21.267
And I want you to understand
the method that we'll pursue in

00:13:21.267 --> 00:13:22.009
the course.
 

00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:26.736
My point is to get you to see
that when we study this text in

00:13:26.736 --> 00:13:28.965
this class,
we're not going to be studying

00:13:28.965 --> 00:13:31.990
it necessarily as scripture,
as the Word of God.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.019
We're not going to be studying
it necessarily for how important

00:13:35.019 --> 00:13:37.317
it was for Medieval and Early
Modern Literature,

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:38.100
for example.
 

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.038
We're going to look at what it
meant in the first century.

00:13:41.038 --> 00:13:44.090
In fact, what I'm going to try
to do is get you to come at the

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.740
New Testament from the outside.
 

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.720
I've been teaching this stuff
for twenty years,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.662
and I tend to find two basic
kinds of students who shop my

00:13:51.662 --> 00:13:55.259
classes for the New Testament
Introduction course.

00:13:55.259 --> 00:13:58.312
One of them are the kinds of
students who grew up in a

00:13:58.312 --> 00:13:59.580
religious household.
 

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:00.480
They went to church.
 

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.350
They maybe even have taken a
lot of Sunday School,

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.034
and so they feel like they know
these texts from at least a

00:14:05.034 --> 00:14:07.350
Sunday School or a church kind
of point of view.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.370
In some ways they kind of feel
like,

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:10.759
"Okay, I know what the New
Testament is,

00:14:10.759 --> 00:14:13.450
and I already know sort of what
I think about it."

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:16.802
There are other people who come
to these classes who grew up in

00:14:16.802 --> 00:14:19.399
a non-religious context;
they know nothing about this.

00:14:19.399 --> 00:14:21.320
They've never read the Bible,
and they come in and they

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.328
think,
"Well I'm taking it

00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:23.649
because I don't know anything
about it."

00:14:23.649 --> 00:14:26.333
But, oddly enough,
because they've been raised in

00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:29.913
our society, they still actually
come at this text with some kind

00:14:29.913 --> 00:14:31.759
of pre-knowledge of the text.
 

00:14:31.759 --> 00:14:34.350
They have a conception of what
the Bible is.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.538
They have a conception of
what-- who Jesus is,

00:14:36.538 --> 00:14:37.220
who Paul is.
 

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:41.259
And so they're coming at the
text already with some kind of

00:14:41.259 --> 00:14:44.604
familiarity with the topic,
at least in a popular

00:14:44.604 --> 00:14:45.649
conception.
 

00:14:45.649 --> 00:14:49.673
Now the reason that is true is
because we live in a

00:14:49.673 --> 00:14:53.860
post-Christian culture,
and both aspects of that term

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.308
are important.
 

00:14:55.308 --> 00:14:58.462
It's post-Christian in the
sense that it's hard to live in

00:14:58.462 --> 00:15:01.948
America without having some kind
of exposure to Christianity and

00:15:01.948 --> 00:15:04.658
without seeing its influence on
our society,

00:15:04.658 --> 00:15:07.149
on our politics,
on our culture and our art,

00:15:07.149 --> 00:15:07.918
and that sort of thing.
 

00:15:07.918 --> 00:15:10.149
But it's also post-Christian
because you can no longer

00:15:10.149 --> 00:15:11.379
assume,
in this culture,

00:15:11.379 --> 00:15:16.015
especially in a multivalent,
poly-ethnic situation like

00:15:16.015 --> 00:15:22.250
Yale, that everybody here is
going to be Christian.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.828
So we're in this kind of
situation where we have the

00:15:25.828 --> 00:15:29.830
hangovers of Christianity still
occupying the culture,

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:33.149
without necessarily knowing a
lot about it.

00:15:33.149 --> 00:15:36.163
So I'm going to ask you to come
at the New Testament,

00:15:36.163 --> 00:15:37.730
though, from the outside.
 

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.529
If you feel like you know
something about it,

00:15:39.529 --> 00:15:42.535
put those aside for the moment,
because when we do the class

00:15:42.535 --> 00:15:45.594
we'll be trying to get you to
see this document as if for the

00:15:45.594 --> 00:15:47.567
first time,
to see early Christianity

00:15:47.567 --> 00:15:49.279
completely as if for the first
time.

00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:52.360
So let's do a little practice
run through this.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.711
Come with me now,
open up your New Testament as

00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:57.740
you're just going to look at it,
and we're going to go through a

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.428
rushed little survey,
through the New Testament.

00:15:59.428 --> 00:16:02.650
How would it strike you if you
knew nothing about it,

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.995
if you had never heard of it
before, if you open up the

00:16:05.995 --> 00:16:08.658
covers of this book for the
first time?

00:16:08.658 --> 00:16:11.320
At the very beginning is the
Gospel of Matthew,

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.756
and it starts like this:
"The book of the

00:16:13.756 --> 00:16:16.302
origin" (or the
genesis is the Greek

00:16:16.302 --> 00:16:19.500
word) "of Jesus Christ,
son of David, son of Abraham.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.850
Abraham had a son named Isaac.
 

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.639
Isaac had a son named Jacob.
 

00:16:23.639 --> 00:16:25.730
Jacob had Judah and his
brothers.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.710
Judah had Perez and Zerah from
Tamar."

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:29.889
And you know how this goes,
right?

00:16:29.889 --> 00:16:31.759
This is the begats,
the famous begats,

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:33.529
that start the Gospel of
Matthew.

00:16:33.529 --> 00:16:34.844
So-and-so begat,
so-and-so begat,

00:16:34.844 --> 00:16:37.389
so-and so, and it goes on like
this for sentences and sentences

00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:38.129
and sentences.
 

00:16:38.129 --> 00:16:40.298
And, as a modern person,
you're going,

00:16:40.298 --> 00:16:41.529
"What is this?
 

00:16:41.529 --> 00:16:43.440
What's going on with this?"
 

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.168
And then you get to the birth
narratives in Matthew,

00:16:46.168 --> 00:16:47.879
the stories of the Baby Jesus.
 

00:16:47.879 --> 00:16:50.940
If you lived during the time of
Matthew himself,

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.750
all of this stuff would seem
fairly familiar to you,

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:57.110
the idea that kings would come
from far off and see a star,

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.548
and that meant that the birth
of someone great had been born.

00:16:59.548 --> 00:17:01.591
This is actually part of
propaganda culture of the

00:17:01.591 --> 00:17:02.259
Ancient World.
 

00:17:02.259 --> 00:17:04.440
If you were an ancient person
and you picked up the Gospel of

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.510
Matthew and you heard these
stories about these kings from

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.519
the East,
following a star and arriving

00:17:08.519 --> 00:17:11.113
and finding this baby,
that would sound--you know,

00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:13.220
okay, this is going to be
somebody great.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.269
This is telling you that this
is himself a king or somebody

00:17:16.269 --> 00:17:16.690
great.
 

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:20.160
So it would sound familiar to
you in the ancient world.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.660
Then you'd go on and read the
rest of the Gospel of Matthew.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.147
It's a story of a man who
travels around,

00:17:25.147 --> 00:17:28.010
giving speeches,
sometimes talking to people or

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:28.818
teaching.
 

00:17:28.818 --> 00:17:32.970
He's exorcising demons,
performs a few miracles,

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.558
he heals people.
 

00:17:34.558 --> 00:17:38.211
And, again, to us in the modern
world, if you didn't already

00:17:38.211 --> 00:17:41.432
have some exposure to religious
narratives like this,

00:17:41.432 --> 00:17:42.980
that would sound odd.
 

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.261
In the ancient world,
actually, it would've sounded

00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:47.663
familiar,
because there are other stories

00:17:47.663 --> 00:17:51.432
of other kinds of teachers who'd
healed and exorcised demons and

00:17:51.432 --> 00:17:52.750
performed miracles.
 

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.356
That was not an uncommon way to
talk about someone who was

00:17:55.356 --> 00:17:56.410
supposed to be great.
 

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:59.490
But then you get to the next
book in the New Testament,

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:00.690
the Gospel of Mark.
 

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.028
Well, it's kind of the same
story.

00:18:03.028 --> 00:18:04.265
It's shorter,
there's less,

00:18:04.265 --> 00:18:05.880
fewer teachings in it but
it's--

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.048
so why do you have the second
chapter of this book retell the

00:18:09.048 --> 00:18:11.849
same story that the first
chapter of the book told?

00:18:11.849 --> 00:18:13.798
The Gospel of Luke, same thing.
 

00:18:13.798 --> 00:18:16.708
You get to the Gospel of
John--John's kind of different,

00:18:16.708 --> 00:18:19.298
it sounds different,
there's a different style.

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:21.730
But again it's the same story
of this same guy.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.394
Why do you have four different
chapters of this book,

00:18:24.394 --> 00:18:25.880
all telling the same story?
 

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.950
That's odd in itself,
from our point of view;

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.200
or it should look odd to us.
 

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.470
Then you get to The Acts of the
Apostles.

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:35.019
Now we're back on more familiar
ground.

00:18:35.019 --> 00:18:37.038
It starts off like the Gospel
of Luke,

00:18:37.038 --> 00:18:39.742
because it's written by the
same guy who wrote the Gospel of

00:18:39.742 --> 00:18:41.690
Luke,
and in fact it starts off with

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.220
a paragraph that kind of
encapsulates the way--

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.798
how the Gospel of Luke ended.
 

00:18:45.798 --> 00:18:49.338
You know, like TV shows,
"Last time on ER."

00:18:49.338 --> 00:18:52.640
And this is the way The Acts of
Apostles begins.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.368
"Last time in Luke it
ended this way.

00:18:54.368 --> 00:18:56.190
Now we're going to take up our
heroes at their next

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.700
point."
 

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:01.058
Then it starts sounding like a
Greco-Roman novel.

00:19:01.058 --> 00:19:03.160
And I have to tell you
something about novels in the

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:03.818
ancient world.
 

00:19:03.818 --> 00:19:05.578
There were Greek and Latin
novels.

00:19:05.578 --> 00:19:08.494
Greek novels usually were about
a man and a woman,

00:19:08.494 --> 00:19:10.816
young, rich,
who see each other and fall

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:13.910
madly in love and passionately
want one another.

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.233
And they might get married,
or they might not get married,

00:19:16.233 --> 00:19:18.108
but they don't get to
consummate their love.

00:19:18.108 --> 00:19:21.271
Instead, one of them gets
kidnapped or has to go off to

00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:24.773
war or captured by pirates,
and she's taken off by pirates

00:19:24.773 --> 00:19:27.057
and sold into slavery,
and she goes all the way around

00:19:27.057 --> 00:19:28.827
the Mediterranean,
and the young man follows her

00:19:28.827 --> 00:19:31.055
around the Mediterranean in
chapter after chapter after

00:19:31.055 --> 00:19:31.509
chapter.
 

00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:34.930
They always almost connect and
almost get to have sex,

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:36.642
and then no,
they're--she's bought by

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:39.019
somebody else and taken into
another slave job,

00:19:39.019 --> 00:19:40.690
or he's captured by pirates.
 

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:43.508
So the whole novel is them
chasing each other around the

00:19:43.508 --> 00:19:46.923
Mediterranean,
with shipwrecks and battles and

00:19:46.923 --> 00:19:51.009
miracles and gods intervening,
and all kinds of stuff.

00:19:51.009 --> 00:19:53.700
And that's what The Acts of the
Apostles kind of looks like.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.680
It's looks like an ancient
Greek novel, except it lacks the

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.700
one thing every good Greek novel
had, sex.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.970
The Acts of the Apostles
doesn't have sex.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.569
You might be disappointed
there, but you also have other

00:20:06.569 --> 00:20:08.318
things that the novels don't
have,

00:20:08.318 --> 00:20:10.826
such as the Holy Spirit being
the main actor for the whole

00:20:10.826 --> 00:20:11.180
thing.
 

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.683
But, notice,
that would look kind of

00:20:12.683 --> 00:20:14.358
familiar to you in the Ancient
World.

00:20:14.358 --> 00:20:16.770
It definitely looks odd to you
in the modern world,

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:19.520
if you don't read it as the
Bible, and if you just read it

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.390
as literature.
 

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.595
And we also realize that The
Acts of the Apostles is

00:20:23.595 --> 00:20:24.348
mistitled.
 

00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:26.108
It's not the acts of all the
apostles,

00:20:26.108 --> 00:20:29.112
it's the acts basically of
Paul, and Paul's not considered

00:20:29.112 --> 00:20:32.220
an apostle by the guy who wrote
the Acts of the Apostles.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.226
This is another little clue
here we'll from learn this

00:20:35.226 --> 00:20:35.848
semester.
 

00:20:35.848 --> 00:20:39.098
The titles of most of the books
in the New Testament were not

00:20:39.098 --> 00:20:42.189
put there by their authors;
they were put there by later

00:20:42.189 --> 00:20:43.220
Christian scribes.
 

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.578
This will be very important.
 

00:20:44.578 --> 00:20:47.400
Then you get to The Letters of
Paul.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:51.085
And is it strange that most of
the New Testament are actually

00:20:51.085 --> 00:20:51.700
letters?
 

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.529
They're not like modern letters.
 

00:20:53.529 --> 00:20:56.390
They're quite a bit like
ancient letters.

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.758
They're usually addressed to
groups of people,

00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:01.705
and they deal with sort of
philosophical sounding issues,

00:21:01.705 --> 00:21:03.970
and they give advice on group
problems.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:06.963
Then you get to The Epistle to
the Hebrews, or,

00:21:06.963 --> 00:21:10.544
in what a better translation
would be, The Letter to the

00:21:10.544 --> 00:21:11.130
Jews.
 

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:14.041
What's odd about it is that as
you read this Epistle to the

00:21:14.041 --> 00:21:15.750
Hebrews, you realize two things.
 

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:19.680
Number one, it's not a letter,
it's actually a sermon.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.440
In fact, it doesn't even claim
to be a letter;

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.118
it looks just like a sermon.
 

00:21:23.118 --> 00:21:26.920
And, you realize this is not
really addressed to Jews,

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.709
it seems to be addressed to
Gentile Christians to convince

00:21:30.709 --> 00:21:34.632
them that Jesus provides for
them a liturgy that is superior

00:21:34.632 --> 00:21:35.630
to Judaism.
 

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:38.750
It's actually neither a letter,
nor is it addressed to Jews.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.303
This leads to an insight,
though, by this time,

00:21:41.303 --> 00:21:43.690
when you're surveying your New
Testament.

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:48.130
These letters seem to be meant
to be read out loud.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:51.130
So what--we'll ask this over
and over again in this

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.467
semester--
what would it mean to read this

00:21:53.467 --> 00:21:56.842
letter out loud in a community,
not alone in your dorm room,

00:21:56.842 --> 00:21:59.089
or just by yourself,
in the library?

00:21:59.089 --> 00:22:01.190
Then you get to 1 Peter.
 

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.090
It's written not to one place,
but it's a circular letter,

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:05.720
meant to be circulated around.
 

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.241
Then you get to 2 and 3 John,
two letters that are written to

00:22:09.241 --> 00:22:12.059
"the elected lady and her
children."

00:22:12.059 --> 00:22:13.618
What does that mean?
 

00:22:13.618 --> 00:22:16.854
Then finally you get to the
Revelation of John,

00:22:16.854 --> 00:22:18.048
The Apocalypse.
 

00:22:18.048 --> 00:22:20.367
The word "revelation"
is just the Latinized,

00:22:20.367 --> 00:22:22.730
English version of the Greek
word apocalypse.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:26.319
And apocalypse just means
opening up, revelation.

00:22:26.319 --> 00:22:29.038
This document is really bizarre.
 

00:22:29.038 --> 00:22:31.997
It's not like anything you've
confronted so far in the New

00:22:31.997 --> 00:22:32.618
Testament.
 

00:22:32.618 --> 00:22:35.980
It starts off with a narrative
about a vision.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:39.613
This guy named John says,
"I was on the Island of

00:22:39.613 --> 00:22:40.230
Patmos.
 

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:41.960
I was in--the Lord's Day.
 

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.650
I started having this vision
and this angel appeared to me

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:44.538
and this all happened."
 

00:22:44.538 --> 00:22:47.949
Then it has several letters,
seven different letters,

00:22:47.949 --> 00:22:51.030
very short letters,
addressed to seven different

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:52.538
Christian churches.
 

00:22:52.538 --> 00:22:58.651
And then it goes into this wild
videogame, MTV-style narrative

00:22:58.651 --> 00:23:02.759
of a heavenly journey of this
guy John.

00:23:02.759 --> 00:23:03.690
He goes up into the heavens.
 

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.440
He sees the throne room of God.
 

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.817
He sees weird kinds of beasts
and animals that had

00:23:07.817 --> 00:23:10.488
like--they're bodies of lambs,
but they've got horns and

00:23:10.488 --> 00:23:12.430
they're bleeding all over the
place.

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.500
It's a story of catastrophes.
 

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.626
It's a story of a cosmic battle
between forces of good and

00:23:17.626 --> 00:23:18.558
forces of evil.
 

00:23:18.558 --> 00:23:21.190
It's like several installments
of Star Wars.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:25.386
And finally it ends up with the
establishment of a new world and

00:23:25.386 --> 00:23:26.720
a new City of God.
 

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.488
Now that's a long way--that's
the end of the New

00:23:29.488 --> 00:23:32.904
Testament--that's a long way
from the little Baby Jesus and

00:23:32.904 --> 00:23:35.318
the Three Kings in Matthew,
isn't it?

00:23:35.318 --> 00:23:38.890
But the New Testament includes
all that kind of diverse

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:41.631
literature;
27 different books,

00:23:41.631 --> 00:23:46.680
written anywhere from the year
50 to the year 150.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.049
So a hundred-year period of
time that these books were

00:23:50.049 --> 00:23:51.450
probably written in.
 

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:54.936
They have different points of
view, different situations,

00:23:54.936 --> 00:23:57.490
different theologies,
different genres.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:00.410
They use confusing in-house
language.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:03.040
I'll point out that in-house
language throughout the

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.240
semester, and we'll talk about
how it should be interpreted.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.298
And these texts almost defy
interpretation by a modern

00:24:10.298 --> 00:24:15.201
person, unless you have guidance
from a historian and expert like

00:24:15.201 --> 00:24:16.348
moi.
 

00:24:16.348 --> 00:24:19.598
Let's do this little trick
again.

00:24:19.598 --> 00:24:21.058
Instead of looking at the
documents from the outside,

00:24:21.058 --> 00:24:23.920
let's look at what would an
early Christian church look like

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.859
if you were just to stumble upon
them?

00:24:25.859 --> 00:24:27.470
A little imagination.
 

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:30.318
Let's pretend that you're a
seamstress.

00:24:30.318 --> 00:24:34.422
You work in a clothing shop in
the City of Corinth,

00:24:34.422 --> 00:24:36.720
in Greece, in the year 56.
 

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:41.779
A guy next door to you,
named Fred, works in a leather

00:24:41.779 --> 00:24:43.690
factory next door.
 

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:47.457
He has just joined a new club
and he's going to tell you all

00:24:47.457 --> 00:24:48.160
about it.
 

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.400
First, they don't meet in the
daytime;

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.635
they meet either early before
light, at dawn,

00:24:55.635 --> 00:24:58.140
or after dark,
at night.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:02.211
There's only enough of them to
fill a decent sized dining room,

00:25:02.211 --> 00:25:05.890
but they call themselves the
"town meeting."

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:08.660
You're not sure what they do at
these meetings.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.608
They don't appear to worship
any god or goddess that you can

00:25:11.608 --> 00:25:11.910
see.
 

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.451
They use the term
"god"

00:25:14.451 --> 00:25:19.140
sometimes, but this god doesn't
have a name, and that's very

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.650
bizarre to you.
 

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:24.479
Remember, you're pretending
you're a Greek person living in

00:25:24.479 --> 00:25:26.130
the year 56 in Corinth.
 

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:28.590
In fact, these people don't
look like they believe in gods

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.058
at all, they look like atheists.
 

00:25:30.058 --> 00:25:33.887
They have a very high respect
for a criminal Jew,

00:25:33.887 --> 00:25:38.595
who led some kind of guerilla
war and was executed long ago,

00:25:38.595 --> 00:25:40.430
somewhere in Syria.
 

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:45.338
Fred says, though,
that this Jew is still alive

00:25:45.338 --> 00:25:46.618
somewhere.
 

00:25:46.618 --> 00:25:49.086
In fact, Fred says that the Jew
"bought"

00:25:49.086 --> 00:25:52.210
him, though you didn't know
that Fred was even ever a slave.

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:54.000
In fact, you're pretty sure
that Steve wasn't a slave.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.380
So what does it mean that this
guy bought him?

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.480
At these town meetings they eat
meals--

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.089
which is not unusual since most
clubs in your society eat

00:26:01.089 --> 00:26:02.945
meals--
but they call the meals

00:26:02.945 --> 00:26:06.567
"the boss's dinner,"
or sometimes "the thank

00:26:06.567 --> 00:26:07.380
you."
 

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:11.215
Some people say they eat human
flesh at these dinners,

00:26:11.215 --> 00:26:15.631
but you doubt that because for
some reason they seem to be all

00:26:15.631 --> 00:26:16.788
vegetarians.
 

00:26:16.788 --> 00:26:19.406
You kind of doubt whether
vegetarians would eat human

00:26:19.406 --> 00:26:19.808
flesh.
 

00:26:19.808 --> 00:26:24.230
Fred says that to initiate new
members into their club,

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:26.730
they "dip them,"
naked,

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:28.778
and then they "get
healthy."

00:26:28.778 --> 00:26:32.082
Once you're in the club they
call you "comrade,"

00:26:32.082 --> 00:26:34.690
and you have sex with anyone
and everyone,

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:36.633
because it doesn't matter
anymore whether you're a man or

00:26:36.633 --> 00:26:38.567
a woman;
in fact, they kind of figure

00:26:38.567 --> 00:26:39.930
you're neither or both.
 

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:42.769
That's this new group.
 

00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:46.015
Now I constructed that little
picture out of actual data from

00:26:46.015 --> 00:26:48.611
the New Testament,
and what we have from writings

00:26:48.611 --> 00:26:50.180
about ancient Christians.
 

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.406
This was the way at least a
good many number of ancient

00:26:53.406 --> 00:26:55.558
people saw early Christian
groups.

00:26:55.558 --> 00:26:58.348
Every one of the little details
there I gave--

00:26:58.348 --> 00:27:00.417
I won't unpack them all for you
now because it would just be

00:27:00.417 --> 00:27:01.680
boring and we need to move
along--

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.527
but every one of those details
comes from some interpretation

00:27:04.527 --> 00:27:06.900
of a particular Greek term that
Christians used.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.605
For example,
I said this meal they have,

00:27:08.605 --> 00:27:10.529
it's called "the boss's
dinner."

00:27:10.529 --> 00:27:12.528
We call it the Lord's Supper.
 

00:27:12.528 --> 00:27:14.422
But "the Lord"
doesn't mean "God"

00:27:14.422 --> 00:27:15.660
necessarily,
it means your boss.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.021
So the Lord's Supper,
put back into normal Greek

00:27:18.021 --> 00:27:20.484
language, would be something
like "the boss's

00:27:20.484 --> 00:27:21.338
dinner."
 

00:27:21.338 --> 00:27:22.183
Or, as I said,
they call it,

00:27:22.183 --> 00:27:23.058
"the thank you."
 

00:27:23.058 --> 00:27:26.617
Episcopalians call the
Communion, when they take it on

00:27:26.617 --> 00:27:28.213
Sunday,
"the Eucharist,"

00:27:28.213 --> 00:27:30.420
which is just from the Greek
word meaning "thanks."

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.700
So all of these different
things-- the part about it,

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:33.910
it doesn't matter whether
you're a man and woman,

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:35.920
Christians went around saying
things like,

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.109
"In Christ there is no
male and female."

00:27:38.109 --> 00:27:41.480
What, no male and female?
 

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:45.064
And some outsiders did
interpret that as meaning that

00:27:45.064 --> 00:27:49.200
these Christians seem to kind of
have sex with each other.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.199
They call each other
"brother"

00:27:50.199 --> 00:27:51.531
and "sister"
and yet they're always talking

00:27:51.531 --> 00:27:52.250
about love all the time.
 

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:54.450
They have meetings at night,
in the dark.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:58.275
Yeah, so there were all these
rumors about early Christian

00:27:58.275 --> 00:27:59.548
groups like this.
 

00:27:59.548 --> 00:28:02.013
So a lot of these things--I
said they call you

00:28:02.013 --> 00:28:03.220
"comrade."
 

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.009
Well Christians called each
other "brother"

00:28:05.009 --> 00:28:05.868
and "sister."
 

00:28:05.868 --> 00:28:08.638
But that wouldn't have been
sort of a normal,

00:28:08.638 --> 00:28:12.480
everyday way to talk about a
stranger in the ancient world.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.396
It would sound somewhat odd,
like in our thinking it would

00:28:15.396 --> 00:28:17.393
be somewhat odd,
or Communist or something,

00:28:17.393 --> 00:28:18.890
to call somebody
"comrade."

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.169
So the language that different
early Christians used about each

00:28:21.169 --> 00:28:22.710
other,
and for themselves,

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:25.450
was sometimes very common Greek
language,

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.482
but sometimes it would've also
sounded strange and kind of

00:28:28.482 --> 00:28:29.920
in-house to other people.
 

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.385
In other words,
the Bible presents us with a

00:28:33.385 --> 00:28:37.298
very strange world,
if we approach it without our

00:28:37.298 --> 00:28:41.092
normal preconceptions,
if we approach it fresh and

00:28:41.092 --> 00:28:42.440
from the outside.
 

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.519
This is an ancient collection
of documents.

00:28:45.519 --> 00:28:49.118
It wasn't all put together
right when they were written.

00:28:49.118 --> 00:28:52.742
Next time I'm going to actually
talk about how did these 27

00:28:52.742 --> 00:28:56.305
different diverse documents come
to be included in the New

00:28:56.305 --> 00:28:57.180
Testament?
 

00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:00.063
That's the whole history of the
canon, and I'll talk about that

00:29:00.063 --> 00:29:01.038
in my next lecture.
 

00:29:01.038 --> 00:29:05.778
In fact, a good bit of the
history of early Christianity,

00:29:05.778 --> 00:29:09.607
and the New Testament itself,
was to take what was a diverse

00:29:09.607 --> 00:29:13.406
group of different people,
all somehow being loyal to this

00:29:13.406 --> 00:29:14.828
guy they called Jesus.
 

00:29:14.828 --> 00:29:17.518
But they weren't all the same,
and they were in different

00:29:17.518 --> 00:29:20.108
geographical situations,
they had different beliefs.

00:29:20.108 --> 00:29:23.992
And early Christianity was an
attempt to pull all these things

00:29:23.992 --> 00:29:26.352
into one unified movement,
in some way,

00:29:26.352 --> 00:29:28.700
to get some kind of uniformity
of belief and practice.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:33.277
So this course is actually
going to run counter to that

00:29:33.277 --> 00:29:37.769
historical tendency to make
unity out of diversity.

00:29:37.769 --> 00:29:39.940
What we're going to do is we're
going to take the New Testament,

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.526
and we're going to take the
different writings,

00:29:41.526 --> 00:29:42.868
and we're going to take them
apart.

00:29:42.868 --> 00:29:47.079
And one of the major themes of
the course will be the diversity

00:29:47.079 --> 00:29:50.131
of Early Christianity;
in fact, the diversity of Early

00:29:50.131 --> 00:29:52.195
Christianities,
is one of the ways I put it on

00:29:52.195 --> 00:29:52.930
the syllabus.
 

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:55.740
We will look at all the
different ways Jesus was thought

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.910
of to be either divine or human
or some combination of both.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:01.693
We'll look at different ways
that early Christians dealt with

00:30:01.693 --> 00:30:04.480
the fact that this movement
seemed to come out of Judaism.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.650
Well, does that mean we're Jews?
 

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:07.578
If not, what does it mean we
are?

00:30:07.578 --> 00:30:09.778
We'll look at all the different
diversities.

00:30:09.778 --> 00:30:12.586
How they treated women,
different ways that women could

00:30:12.586 --> 00:30:14.250
take a place in this movement.
 

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:16.999
Or different ways that they
treated slaves and other

00:30:16.999 --> 00:30:18.670
servants in their households.
 

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:20.920
How did they react to the
politics?

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.220
How did they react to the
powerful Roman Empire?

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.318
We'll take all these different
topics,

00:30:25.318 --> 00:30:27.821
at different points in the
course, and we'll talk about the

00:30:27.821 --> 00:30:29.979
diverse ways that early
Christians reacted to these

00:30:29.979 --> 00:30:32.278
social and cultural issues,
and we'll read the New

00:30:32.278 --> 00:30:33.450
Testament in light of that.
 

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:36.954
So what's going on is taking
what is a unity,

00:30:36.954 --> 00:30:41.894
and pulling apart that unity to
see the diversity of this early

00:30:41.894 --> 00:30:45.318
Christian movement and these
documents.

00:30:45.318 --> 00:30:48.515
Now I'm going to pause for a
minute and let you ask

00:30:48.515 --> 00:30:51.327
questions, or make comments,
or throw things,

00:30:51.327 --> 00:30:52.349
or whatever.
 

00:30:52.349 --> 00:30:55.309
Don't be shy.
 

00:30:55.309 --> 00:30:56.828
Yes?
 

00:30:56.828 --> 00:30:59.352
Student:  Are you going
to talk at all about sort of how

00:30:59.352 --> 00:31:01.751
the decisions were made to what
documents to include or what

00:31:01.751 --> 00:31:02.769
documents to exclude?
 

00:31:02.769 --> 00:31:03.980
Prof: Yes.
 

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.355
He asked if I was going to talk
about how decisions were made

00:31:06.355 --> 00:31:08.613
about what to include in the New
Testament and what not to

00:31:08.613 --> 00:31:09.920
include in the New Testament.
 

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.655
And I'll talk about that
actually the next lecture,

00:31:11.655 --> 00:31:13.220
when I talk about the history
of the canon.

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:16.003
Why were some books--there were
a lot more early Christian

00:31:16.003 --> 00:31:17.910
pieces of literature that we
know of.

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:19.589
Some we're discovering all the
time.

00:31:19.589 --> 00:31:20.578
The Gospel of Judas.
 

00:31:20.578 --> 00:31:23.059
You may have read in the
newspapers and magazines that a

00:31:23.059 --> 00:31:25.180
new Gospel of Judas has just
been published,

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.797
that some people at Yale
actually knew twenty years ago

00:31:27.797 --> 00:31:30.269
existed because it was shown to
some people here.

00:31:30.269 --> 00:31:31.818
But most people didn't know
about it.

00:31:31.818 --> 00:31:34.000
And it's just been published in
an English translation.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.960
Why did the Gospel of Judas not
make it into the canon?

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.240
We'll talk about those issues
next time.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.160
Yes sir?
 

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.576
Student:  Are we going
to go over the different

00:31:42.576 --> 00:31:43.259
translations?
 

00:31:43.259 --> 00:31:45.887
Prof: Are we going to go
over the different translations,

00:31:45.887 --> 00:31:46.890
and which one is best?
 

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.960
We will raise the issue of
translation periodically.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.693
For example,
when I talk about the syllabus

00:31:51.693 --> 00:31:53.594
in just a moment,
I'm going to talk about what

00:31:53.594 --> 00:31:56.217
Bible you should bring to class,
and I recommend--I did

00:31:56.217 --> 00:31:59.990
recommend one particular study
bible to the bookstore to buy,

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:03.108
but I'm sort of hoping that not
everybody will bring that same

00:32:03.108 --> 00:32:04.950
translation of the New
Testament,

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:08.002
because sometimes I'll say,
"Well this translation

00:32:08.002 --> 00:32:09.528
says this in the English.
 

00:32:09.528 --> 00:32:11.858
Does anyone have a different
translation?"

00:32:11.858 --> 00:32:14.049
And at particular points,
when there is something

00:32:14.049 --> 00:32:16.150
important about the different
translations,

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:19.029
I'll bring that up,
and I'll explain every once in

00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.558
awhile.
 

00:32:19.558 --> 00:32:21.630
That won't be sort of a major
lecture in its own right.

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.359
It's something that will come
up over and over again.

00:32:23.359 --> 00:32:25.200
How does translation happen?
 

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.970
How do debates about
translation get resolved?

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:30.180
Yes?
 

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.223
Student:  Are you going
to talk about the Old Testament

00:32:33.223 --> 00:32:35.970
at all, either sort of how
&gt;.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:37.640
Prof: Am I going to talk
about the Old Testament at all?

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.368
I will when it's relevant.
 

00:32:39.368 --> 00:32:41.710
So, for example,
next time I will also talk a

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:44.048
bit about the canon of the Old
Testament,

00:32:44.048 --> 00:32:46.554
and how there are different
decisions about that from the

00:32:46.554 --> 00:32:47.269
New Testament.
 

00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:50.156
I'll talk about why the Jewish
Bible is different from the

00:32:50.156 --> 00:32:52.689
Roman Catholic Bible,
even with regard to what they

00:32:52.689 --> 00:32:54.259
consider the Old Testament.
 

00:32:54.259 --> 00:32:57.910
When we talk about
apocalypticism,

00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:59.910
and the Gospel of Mark and
Judaism,

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:03.740
I'm actually going to--you have
to read at least the last half

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.160
of the Book of Daniel,
from the Old Testament.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.395
And the reason is because
Daniel is an older apocalyptic,

00:33:10.395 --> 00:33:13.863
prophetic text that was heavily
influenced on early Christian

00:33:13.863 --> 00:33:14.730
literature.
 

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:18.657
And I will give a lecture in
about two more times on the

00:33:18.657 --> 00:33:22.230
history of Judaism in this
Second Temple Period;

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:25.564
that is, what did Judaism look
like at the time of Jesus and

00:33:25.564 --> 00:33:25.960
Paul?
 

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.685
And that will necessitate
referring to the Hebrew Bible

00:33:28.685 --> 00:33:29.039
some.
 

00:33:29.039 --> 00:33:30.288
So I will every once in awhile.
 

00:33:30.288 --> 00:33:32.828
But I'm not going to--I will,
for example,

00:33:32.828 --> 00:33:36.286
talk about why did the Gospel
of Matthew take this particular

00:33:36.286 --> 00:33:39.108
Hebrew Bible text to be a
prophecy about Jesus?

00:33:39.108 --> 00:33:41.954
And we'll look back maybe and
see how that difficult text

00:33:41.954 --> 00:33:44.088
would've looked in its original
context.

00:33:44.088 --> 00:33:47.923
But-- so when it's relevant,
I will refer back to the Hebrew

00:33:47.923 --> 00:33:49.808
Bible or the Old Testament.
 

00:33:49.808 --> 00:33:52.950
And for those of you who are
not aware, what Christians call

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:56.250
the Old Testament is simply what
Jews call the Hebrew Bible.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:58.009
It basically refers to the same
document.

00:33:58.009 --> 00:34:00.904
We just use different terms,
because for the Jews,

00:34:00.904 --> 00:34:04.095
of course, Hebrew scripture is
not old, in the sense of

00:34:04.095 --> 00:34:05.099
passé.
 

00:34:05.099 --> 00:34:11.500
Any other questions?
 

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.179
Yes.
 

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:15.556
Student:  Will we be
talking somewhat about the

00:34:15.556 --> 00:34:18.250
legacy of the Bible on later
literature or in the context?

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:20.456
Prof: Will we be talking
about the legacies of the Bible

00:34:20.456 --> 00:34:21.239
in later literature?
 

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:22.530
Not as much as I should.
 

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:24.518
And that's why at the very
beginning of this lecture--

00:34:24.518 --> 00:34:26.219
you may have come in a little
bit late--

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:29.302
I said this course will
concentrate on the meaning of

00:34:29.302 --> 00:34:32.150
these texts in their early
historical context.

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:34.574
Every once in a while we'll
bring up an issue of well,

00:34:34.574 --> 00:34:36.909
how has this been interpreted
over the centuries?

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:39.938
The one time we will get this
very strongly is the one time

00:34:39.938 --> 00:34:42.289
where you go with your
discussion section--

00:34:42.289 --> 00:34:43.670
I'll talk about the discussion
sections in a moment.

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:46.668
You're expected to all go to
the Yale Art Gallery and go

00:34:46.668 --> 00:34:50.005
through the Art Gallery,
with your discussion leader,

00:34:50.005 --> 00:34:53.606
and then you'll do a lot of
looking at how are biblical

00:34:53.606 --> 00:34:56.539
themes and issues portrayed in
later art.

00:34:56.539 --> 00:34:59.230
And that may bring up chances
to talk about literature also.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:01.659
If you want to bring up those
kinds of issues,

00:35:01.659 --> 00:35:02.469
feel free to.
 

00:35:02.469 --> 00:35:05.226
But I'm going to concentrate,
in this course,

00:35:05.226 --> 00:35:08.860
on the meaning of these texts
in their earliest context.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.719
Anybody else?
 

00:35:10.719 --> 00:35:12.139
Questions?
 

00:35:12.139 --> 00:35:14.030
Okay, look at your syllabus.
 

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:17.380
If you don't have a
syllabus--are there any extras

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.268
back there?
 

00:35:18.268 --> 00:35:21.251
Okay, well you can find the
syllabus--if you want to--there

00:35:21.251 --> 00:35:23.768
are some more right here,
if anybody needs one.

00:35:23.768 --> 00:35:27.460
If you, or a friend of yours,
wants to see this syllabus

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.077
after the class,
and you don't have one,

00:35:30.077 --> 00:35:32.360
it's on the Classes v2 server.
 

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.454
So you can go online and get
the syllabus,

00:35:34.454 --> 00:35:36.039
and download it and print it.
 

00:35:36.039 --> 00:35:39.429
One of the things I want to
emphasize, that I've not

00:35:39.429 --> 00:35:42.353
emphasized already,
is attendance here in the

00:35:42.353 --> 00:35:44.679
lectures is very much required.
 

00:35:44.679 --> 00:35:47.039
You will be expected to come to
the lectures.

00:35:47.039 --> 00:35:48.994
Just because this is a large
lecture course doesn't mean you

00:35:48.994 --> 00:35:49.789
can skip the lectures.
 

00:35:49.789 --> 00:35:51.900
Even if you're doing the
readings from the textbook,

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.010
you'll get stuff from my
lectures that you won't get

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:54.590
elsewhere.
 

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:57.530
So you are required to come to
the lectures.

00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:00.059
The section leaders,
once they get to know you,

00:36:00.059 --> 00:36:02.682
they'll actually be looking to
see whether the people in their

00:36:02.682 --> 00:36:04.489
section are missing a bunch of
lectures;

00:36:04.489 --> 00:36:05.889
and I've asked them to take
notes.

00:36:05.889 --> 00:36:08.637
If you're missing a lot of
lectures, it could affect your

00:36:08.637 --> 00:36:09.030
grade.
 

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:12.090
So please come to the lectures.
 

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:14.632
There are only three
assignments: two six-page

00:36:14.632 --> 00:36:16.780
papers, that I'll explain how to
do.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.413
One is a exegesis paper,
and we'll spend a whole section

00:36:19.413 --> 00:36:22.333
discussion talking about what we
mean by exegesis and teaching

00:36:22.333 --> 00:36:23.340
you how to do it.
 

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.226
Another paper will be a
thematic paper on some aspect of

00:36:26.226 --> 00:36:29.375
conflict among early Christians,
such as Judaism and the Law,

00:36:29.375 --> 00:36:30.739
or women, or politics.
 

00:36:30.739 --> 00:36:32.099
And then the final.
 

00:36:32.099 --> 00:36:34.800
There will never be a sit-down
final in class.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.846
Your final exam will be
basically one or two questions

00:36:37.846 --> 00:36:40.030
that I'll give to you ahead of
time.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:42.550
You take it home and you write
basically an 8-page,

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:44.500
double-spaced paper on the
question,

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.079
not doing research--we don't
want you to run outside and do

00:36:47.079 --> 00:36:47.570
research.
 

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:49.409
Using the material you've
learned in class,

00:36:49.409 --> 00:36:53.262
you'll be expected to answer
some big questions for an 8-page

00:36:53.262 --> 00:36:57.050
final paper that you'll turn in
at a date to be assigned.

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:59.360
Procedures for evaluation are
important.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.768
To make an A paper in my class,
to make an A on a paper,

00:37:02.768 --> 00:37:06.025
not only does the paper have to
have the right answers and

00:37:06.025 --> 00:37:09.570
fulfill the assignment,
it has to be written elegantly

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:10.739
and excellently.
 

00:37:10.739 --> 00:37:15.590
Every Yale student has access
to free writing tutors.

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:18.349
I don't know if you realize how
rare that is,

00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:19.289
in a college.
 

00:37:19.289 --> 00:37:21.425
It certainly wasn't available
to me or most people of my

00:37:21.425 --> 00:37:21.929
generation.
 

00:37:21.929 --> 00:37:24.329
But I know you have access to
writing tutors.

00:37:24.329 --> 00:37:27.202
You can make an A in this class
by writing your paper as far

00:37:27.202 --> 00:37:30.074
enough ahead of time that you
can take it to a writing tutor

00:37:30.074 --> 00:37:33.190
and get the writing tutor to
help you get the style better,

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:34.780
and then turn that version in.
 

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:37.670
That'll be much more likely to
give you an A.

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:40.443
If you write a paper that says
all the right things,

00:37:40.443 --> 00:37:43.489
does all the right things,
and yet it's not well written,

00:37:43.489 --> 00:37:44.360
it gets a B.
 

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.039
If it's a C,
that means it's even worse

00:37:47.039 --> 00:37:50.990
written, and Ds and Fs mean you
didn't really fulfill the

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:52.050
assignment.
 

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:55.349
The texts that I've ordered
from the bookstore--

00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:58.614
unfortunately I ordered them
late, but the Labyrinth

00:37:58.614 --> 00:38:01.880
Bookstore will have the textbook
by Bart Ehrman,

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.210
that you can also go online and
just order it yourself.

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:06.690
The information is here on the
syllabus.

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:09.407
I've ordered the Oxford
Annotated Version of the New

00:38:09.407 --> 00:38:11.539
Revised Standard Version of the
Bible.

00:38:11.539 --> 00:38:13.501
But, like I say,
you're welcome to bring other

00:38:13.501 --> 00:38:15.159
translations,
other versions.

00:38:15.159 --> 00:38:17.931
When we use the term version,
of a Bible, that just means a

00:38:17.931 --> 00:38:20.320
different translation of the
Bible into English.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.514
So if you want to use a Revised
Standard Version,

00:38:22.514 --> 00:38:24.847
that is other than the New
Revised Standard Version,

00:38:24.847 --> 00:38:25.579
that's fine.
 

00:38:25.579 --> 00:38:27.059
The New International Bible.
 

00:38:27.059 --> 00:38:30.242
There are several other Bible
translations that are

00:38:30.242 --> 00:38:31.070
acceptable.
 

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:34.458
I don't want you to use the old
translations,

00:38:34.458 --> 00:38:39.389
such as the King James Version,
or the Catholic Douay Version.

00:38:39.389 --> 00:38:41.708
Those have too many
inaccuracies because they're

00:38:41.708 --> 00:38:42.449
just too old.
 

00:38:42.449 --> 00:38:45.581
I also would rather you not use
the sort of paraphrases,

00:38:45.581 --> 00:38:46.949
like the Living Bible.
 

00:38:46.949 --> 00:38:49.356
But if you want to use other
translations,

00:38:49.356 --> 00:38:50.179
that's fine.
 

00:38:50.179 --> 00:38:52.222
In fact, sometimes that'll help
us because we'll compare

00:38:52.222 --> 00:38:52.780
translations.
 

00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.440
Don't worry about discussion
sections yet.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.115
I'm not sure whether we'll use
the Classes server to have you

00:39:03.115 --> 00:39:04.989
sign up for discussion sections
online,

00:39:04.989 --> 00:39:07.528
or whether we will do it the
old-fashioned way and have you

00:39:07.528 --> 00:39:09.849
sign up on forms that we'll give
you here in class.

00:39:09.849 --> 00:39:11.699
But we will organize you into
discussion sections.

00:39:11.699 --> 00:39:14.099
There'll be a variety of times
you can choose.

00:39:14.099 --> 00:39:16.001
So there'll be options about
when your discussion section

00:39:16.001 --> 00:39:16.409
will meet.
 

00:39:16.409 --> 00:39:18.577
We'll try to make sure
everybody's schedule is

00:39:18.577 --> 00:39:20.594
accommodated,
and you'll either meet on

00:39:20.594 --> 00:39:23.025
Thursdays or Fridays,
in discussion sections,

00:39:23.025 --> 00:39:25.987
and we'll organize those
sections closer to the end of

00:39:25.987 --> 00:39:28.753
the shopping period,
when we have a better idea who

00:39:28.753 --> 00:39:29.559
will be in here.
 

00:39:29.559 --> 00:39:32.150
As I said, the rest of the
organization of the class I

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:33.909
think is pretty well
self-evident.

00:39:33.909 --> 00:39:37.070
The class is organized first to
teach you the methods of the

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:39.909
historical critical approach to
the New Testament,

00:39:39.909 --> 00:39:41.987
and help you learn how to do
those through exegesis and

00:39:41.987 --> 00:39:42.719
historical study.
 

00:39:42.719 --> 00:39:44.230
And then the second half of the
class,

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:47.429
we turn our attentions to more
of these issues of disagreement

00:39:47.429 --> 00:39:49.530
and debate within early
Christianity,

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:52.619
around issues such as Judaism
and the Law,

00:39:52.619 --> 00:39:55.177
women's positions,
politics, and the

00:39:55.177 --> 00:39:57.369
interpretation of scripture.
 

00:39:57.369 --> 00:39:59.969
So that's basically the
semester.

00:39:59.969 --> 00:40:01.619
Any other questions?
 

00:40:01.619 --> 00:40:02.940
Comments?
 

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.500
Outbursts?
 

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.079
Last chance.
 

00:40:06.079 --> 00:40:08.358
All right, if you decide to
take the course,

00:40:08.358 --> 00:40:11.170
I will see you same place,
same time, on Wednesday.

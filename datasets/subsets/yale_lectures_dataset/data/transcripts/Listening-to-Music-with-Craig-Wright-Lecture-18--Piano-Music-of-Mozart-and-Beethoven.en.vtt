00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.059
Prof: Okay.
 

00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:06.982
So this morning what we're
going to be dealing with is the

00:00:06.982 --> 00:00:10.080
question of the development of
the piano,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.973
really from the time of Mozart
through Beethoven through Chopin

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:19.550
and through Liszt up to the
modern grand piano that you see

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.970
in front of us and we'll end
with a guest performer.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.670
Dan Schlossberg will be coming
in about 11 o'clock and we'll be

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.640
talking with Dan at that point.
 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.249
We start with Mozart because he
was the first composer to switch

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:37.250
from the harpsichord over to the
piano.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.854
The harpsichord was the primary
instrument, of course,

00:00:40.854 --> 00:00:43.574
of the Baroque period,
as we said before,

00:00:43.574 --> 00:00:44.730
1600 to 1750.
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.521
Now our first slide that we see
on the screen this morning is a

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:51.702
Dutch harpsichord--comes in the
Low Countries--of the

00:00:51.702 --> 00:00:53.170
seventeenth century.
 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.036
It's actually in our own
collection of historical musical

00:00:57.036 --> 00:00:59.660
instruments at 17 Hillhouse
Avenue,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.145
and many of the slides that
we'll--we will be seeing today

00:01:03.145 --> 00:01:05.530
come from that particular
collection.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.069
So if you ever happen to be
sick and going over to DUH,

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:12.039
right next to DUH on this side
of the railroad tracks or the

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.403
canal there is this splendid
collection of keyboard

00:01:15.403 --> 00:01:16.480
instruments.
 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.417
You got a chance I believe in
section last time to deal with

00:01:22.417 --> 00:01:25.572
the harpsichord,
and perhaps even play the

00:01:25.572 --> 00:01:27.078
harpsichord,
and you remember that it

00:01:27.078 --> 00:01:31.000
produces this kind of tinkling,
jangling effect. Right?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.662
So if you ever hear a tingling,
jangling keyboard instrument on

00:01:34.662 --> 00:01:37.970
a test, what are you going to
say about musical style?

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.470
What period does it come from?
 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.340
Daniel.
 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.069
Student: Baroque.
 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:43.123
Prof: Baroque.
 

00:01:43.123 --> 00:01:44.530
Okay, so that's a good key.
 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.180
It's one of the fingerprints
for Baroque music.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.473
But young Mozart here about
1770-1780, he came to prefer the

00:01:53.473 --> 00:01:58.229
piano because what was the one
limitation or a central

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.280
limitation of the harpsichord?
 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.084
What was the problem,
in essence, with the

00:02:03.084 --> 00:02:03.700
harpsichord?
 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.739
Nice and loud.
 

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:07.260
Kristin, is it?
 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.270
I can hardly see back there.
 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.409
Kristin, nice and loud.
 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:10.069
Student: No dynamics.
 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.169
Prof: No dynamics.
 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:11.399
Okay.
 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:13.139
Basically, you get one dynamic
level.

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:16.442
Yeah, you can throw some levers
and maybe bring some more

00:02:16.442 --> 00:02:20.039
strings in but it's cumbersome
and you can't shade a scale;

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.810
you can't reach for a climax.
 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.908
It's not only dynamics.
 

00:02:22.908 --> 00:02:25.889
It's shading that's also very
important there.

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:29.104
So people began to switch over
to this thing called the

00:02:29.104 --> 00:02:29.878
pianoforte.
 

00:02:29.878 --> 00:02:33.179
Originally, it was all one
word, pianoforte,

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:37.937
the loud-soft or the soft-loud,
pianoforte, so that there could

00:02:37.937 --> 00:02:40.008
be gradations of sound.
 

00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:44.675
And this was an instrument
invented in Florence around

00:02:44.675 --> 00:02:45.378
1700..
 

00:02:45.378 --> 00:02:47.970
Actually, we know the name of
the person who did it,

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.190
Bartolomeo Cristofori.
 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.650
I didn't put that up on the
board but that's what happened

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.775
in Florence around 1700,
and it took about fifty years

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:59.622
or so for this to catch on,
this invention to catch on and

00:02:59.622 --> 00:03:02.460
gradually replace the
harpsichord,

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.935
but notice that when we have
our first pianos that they look

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:08.348
virtually identical to the
harpsichord.

00:03:08.348 --> 00:03:10.430
Here is a harpsichord from our
collection.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.526
Here is a piano of the sort
that Mozart would have played

00:03:15.526 --> 00:03:16.710
about 1770.
 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.845
So it's not that much bigger.
 

00:03:17.845 --> 00:03:18.120
Right?
 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.567
Go back and forth quickly,
if you would,

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:21.068
Jacob.
 

00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:24.768
There is the harpsichord and
there's the piano,

00:03:24.768 --> 00:03:27.421
and, as said,
Mozart was the first

00:03:27.421 --> 00:03:32.004
significant composer to switch
from the harpsichord to the

00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:32.970
piano.
 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.661
Mozart, of course,
came from the city of Salzburg,

00:03:36.661 --> 00:03:40.654
Austria, and he was an
employee, a sort of disgruntled

00:03:40.654 --> 00:03:43.970
employee, of the Archbishop of
Salzburg.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.830
He referred to the archbishop
as the "Archbooby."

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.460
And Mozart is thought to be a
composer who worked at the

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.280
piano.
 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.811
And indeed so was Joseph Haydn,
Mozart's contemporary and dear,

00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:00.060
dear friend.
 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.688
It's Mozart that first called
Haydn "Papa Haydn."

00:04:03.688 --> 00:04:06.250
So let's go on to two slides
here.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.530
We've got a couple to skim and
then here is Haydn.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.634
He's composing,
thinking things through at a

00:04:11.634 --> 00:04:12.430
keyboard.
 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.800
And here is Mozart working at a
keyboard.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.569
But Mozart actually didn't
compose at a keyboard.

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:25.699
What--why is he then seated at
a keyboard?

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.319
To show that he's a musician.
 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:30.889
You need an icon to associate
it with.

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.607
When Mozart composed--do you
know where he did most of his

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:34.180
composing?
 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.889
Some of it at a billiard table,
but most of it in bed.

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.850
His sister tells us that and
his wife tells us that.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.000
He would get up in the morning.
 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.384
He would just stay in bed and
he had this kind of desk with

00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:47.440
ink trays and sand and stuff to
blot the paper,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.983
and he would work in bed from
about seven until ten in the

00:04:49.983 --> 00:04:50.430
morning.
 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.889
He didn't need a piano.
 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.350
He heard it all in his head.
 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.644
In any event,
in 1781 Mozart has had it with

00:04:56.644 --> 00:04:58.779
the "Archbooby"
of Salzburg.

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:03.083
He breaks free of him and
establishes himself as a

00:05:03.083 --> 00:05:06.860
freelance musician in the city
of Vienna.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.223
This was kind of a risky
gambit--to be a freelance

00:05:10.223 --> 00:05:10.980
musician.
 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.250
We have two freelance musicians
in our midst today,

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.959
Santana and Jacob.
 

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:20.740
How is it, Santana,
being a freelance musician?

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.730
Student: Busy.
 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:22.461
Prof: Busy.
 

00:05:22.461 --> 00:05:23.439
What do you have to do?
 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:25.942
Student: Run around to--
Prof: Run around to

00:05:25.942 --> 00:05:28.872
different gigs,
right, trying to patch together

00:05:28.872 --> 00:05:32.516
a living as best you can until
you work your way up to a more

00:05:32.516 --> 00:05:33.670
secure position.
 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.449
Same thing, I'm sure,
with Jacob.

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.329
Well, what did Mozart do when
he got to Vienna then?

00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:40.269
How was he going to patch
together a living?

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:42.639
He did it through two ways.
 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:50.636
One, he was going to give piano
lessons to the aristocracy and

00:05:50.636 --> 00:05:56.404
two, he was going to play the
piano in public

00:05:56.404 --> 00:06:00.730
concerts--teacher,
performer.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.184
And as a result of this,
he perfected or contributed

00:06:04.184 --> 00:06:08.180
greatly to two important genres
in the history of music,

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.399
those genres being the piano
sonata--

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:13.689
we've talked about the sonata,
usually three movements.

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:15.860
Those he wrote mostly for his
pupils.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.339
And then the piano
concerto--Mozart wrote

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:20.879
twenty-three original piano
concertos--

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:24.209
the piano concerto,
which he wrote principally for

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:27.810
himself as a kind of showpiece
for public concerts.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.488
And you will be watching in
section beginning this evening,

00:06:31.488 --> 00:06:35.040
a wonderful video of the
performance of the great D Minor

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.879
Piano Concerto of Mozart.
 

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:44.007
Mozart's piano concertos are
much more difficult than his

00:06:44.007 --> 00:06:45.279
sonatas.
 

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:50.019
He intended these piano
concertos for he himself--no,

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:51.660
for him himself?
 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.357
I guess so, for him,
yeah--to play,

00:06:54.357 --> 00:06:57.132
and he did so,
interestingly enough,

00:06:57.132 --> 00:07:02.290
at this public hall that was
located in the casino in Vienna.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.119
Here's a picture of that
casino, which today is actually

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:08.310
the--it's this building to the
right there, the tallest one.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.129
It's a big building and it had
a big public space in it and

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:12.490
that's where he performed.
 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.355
It still exists.
 

00:07:13.355 --> 00:07:14.870
That building still exists.
 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.338
It's the Ambassador Hotel in
downtown--in the Neuer Market

00:07:19.338 --> 00:07:21.220
Platz there in Vienna.
 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.278
Why did Mozart play in a casino?
 

00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:28.944
I was driving down the highway
the other day and I saw a sign

00:07:28.944 --> 00:07:31.509
up there: Usher at Mohegan Sun.
 

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:35.540
My wife thought this might be a
Poe play, you know.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.649
But who is Usher?
 

00:07:37.649 --> 00:07:40.480
A rap artist?
 

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.290
Do--he is a musician. Right?
 

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:44.399
No?
 

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:45.480
Who's Usher?
 

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.629
Come on, guys.
 

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:47.850
Student: An R&amp;B
singer.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:48.877
Prof: Okay.
 

00:07:48.877 --> 00:07:50.819
Frederick, nice and loud,
please.

00:07:50.819 --> 00:07:51.949
Student: An R&amp;B
singer.

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:54.899
Prof: An R&amp;B singer,
but he's playing the casinos

00:07:54.899 --> 00:07:56.550
because that's where the money
is.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:57.000
Okay?
 

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.870
That's where the money is.
 

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.560
That's where the crowd is;
that's where the money is.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.228
And Mozart was doing this back
in the eighteenth century as

00:08:02.228 --> 00:08:02.550
well.
 

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:06.543
The other venue that he
played--I think I've got a slide

00:08:06.543 --> 00:08:09.014
of this;
Jacob, let's take a look at

00:08:09.014 --> 00:08:12.310
this--is the local Court
Theater, the Burgtheater.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.250
It wasn't that big.
 

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.569
It was about the size of our
own Sprague Hall here,

00:08:16.569 --> 00:08:20.154
Morse Recital Hall inside of
Sprague Hall--seated about

00:08:20.154 --> 00:08:23.209
eighteen--excuse me,
eight hundred people.

00:08:23.209 --> 00:08:27.649
And for this Mozart would have
to hire the orchestra,

00:08:27.649 --> 00:08:29.769
he would have to compose the
music,

00:08:29.769 --> 00:08:31.259
he would have to print the
tickets,

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:33.202
he would have to sell the
tickets out of his own

00:08:33.202 --> 00:08:36.284
apartment,
and he would have to transport

00:08:36.284 --> 00:08:41.376
his own piano over to this hall
to provide the instrument for

00:08:41.376 --> 00:08:42.649
him to play.
 

00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:44.190
Let's take a look at this piano
of Mozart.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.230
So here is a piano of Mozart.
 

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.399
It's a very small instrument,
as you can see.

00:08:49.399 --> 00:08:53.259
Its compass is only five
octaves, F to F.

00:08:53.259 --> 00:08:58.700
So it--and it has only one
string per key.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.283
If you go up to the modern
grand and actually look at it,

00:09:01.283 --> 00:09:02.528
you'll--you hit middle C.
 

00:09:02.528 --> 00:09:05.193
There are actually three
strings up there that get struck

00:09:05.193 --> 00:09:07.288
by that hammer,
but in Mozart's piano there'd

00:09:07.288 --> 00:09:08.048
only be one.
 

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:11.149
It's much smaller in a number
of different ways.

00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:17.070
Now let's take a listen to it.
 

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:21.200
Let's listen to a performance
on Mozart's piano.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.952
And I emphasize here:
this is not a replica of a

00:09:24.952 --> 00:09:27.350
piano that--of Mozart's day.
 

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.730
This is Mozart's own piano.
 

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.583
After he died it went to his
widow who gave it to the eldest

00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:38.676
son and ultimately it came in--
back into Salzburg and is today

00:09:38.676 --> 00:09:42.370
in the Wohnungshaus there in
Salzburg.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.342
So this is the real piano and
we're going to hear a

00:09:45.342 --> 00:09:48.080
performance of the famous Sonata
in C Major.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.649
So let's listen to a little bit
of Mozart's own piano.

00:09:50.649 --> 00:10:35.919
&gt;
 

00:10:35.919 --> 00:10:38.668
Let's stop it there.
 

00:10:38.668 --> 00:10:43.519
Notice that Mozart's piano--
&gt;

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:45.250
In that piece he was in the
dominant there at the end of the

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:45.602
first theme.
 

00:10:45.602 --> 00:10:46.220
&gt;
 

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.129
&gt;
 

00:10:47.129 --> 00:10:48.654
Now it was
&gt;

00:10:48.654 --> 00:10:50.129
&gt;.
 

00:10:50.129 --> 00:10:53.049
That's the pitch at which
Mozart's piano is tuned and

00:10:53.049 --> 00:10:56.418
probably pretty close to what it
was tuned in his own day.

00:10:56.418 --> 00:11:00.225
So he was writing it in the key
of G, which is here,

00:11:00.225 --> 00:11:02.389
&gt;
 

00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:05.234
but it's--they--it sounding for
our ears &lt;&lt;plays

00:11:05.234 --> 00:11:06.038
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:11:06.038 --> 00:11:06.380
there.
 

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.052
Is that higher or lower,
Mozart's--the tuning of

00:11:09.052 --> 00:11:10.360
Mozart's instrument?
 

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:10.850
&gt;
 

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.759
Here's what he wrote it for;
here's what it is sounding.

00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:14.850
&gt;
 

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:15.604
Higher or lower?
 

00:11:15.604 --> 00:11:16.500
What do you think?
 

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.164
How many say higher?
 

00:11:17.164 --> 00:11:17.928
Raise your right hand.
 

00:11:17.928 --> 00:11:19.037
How many say lower?
 

00:11:19.037 --> 00:11:20.320
Raise your left hand.
 

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.909
Interesting.
 

00:11:21.909 --> 00:11:24.350
It's actually lower, yeah.
 

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.528
It's down a half a step and
that was typical.

00:11:27.528 --> 00:11:29.330
I think we talked about that
before.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.243
The tuning kind of floated
around up until really the

00:11:32.243 --> 00:11:35.268
twentieth century when it
got--sort of got fixed that A

00:11:35.268 --> 00:11:37.509
should be 440 vibrations per
second.

00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:38.899
So that's Mozart's own piano.
 

00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:40.549
What did you think about the
sound of it?

00:11:40.549 --> 00:11:42.460
Any adjectives there?
 

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.952
Somebody tell me something
about the sound of Mozart's

00:11:45.952 --> 00:11:46.480
piano.
 

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.625
Play the beginning again
if--are you still there on that

00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:49.970
one?
 

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:50.330
Okay.
 

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.379
Give me two adjectives about
this sound.

00:11:53.379 --> 00:12:05.860
&gt;
 

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.639
Someone give me--shout out an
adjective.

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:09.350
Student: Shallow.
 

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:10.679
Prof: Sarah.
 

00:12:10.679 --> 00:12:11.450
Student: Shallow.
 

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:12.418
Prof: Shallow.
 

00:12:12.418 --> 00:12:12.649
Okay.
 

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:14.360
It doesn't have a lot of
resonance.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.110
It does not--It's not a big,
rich sound.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.817
So the sound dissipates very
quickly because there are not a

00:12:21.817 --> 00:12:25.250
lot of resonators around that
instrument.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:26.389
So we'll take shallow.
 

00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:28.110
Give me another adjective.
 

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:29.350
Roger.
 

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.778
Student: Punchy.
 

00:12:29.778 --> 00:12:30.854
Prof: Pungent.
 

00:12:30.854 --> 00:12:32.850
Okay, kind of sharp--pungent
you said?

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:34.048
Student: Punchy.
 

00:12:34.048 --> 00:12:35.231
Prof: Punchy.
 

00:12:35.231 --> 00:12:37.418
Oh, I like that even better,
punchy.

00:12:37.418 --> 00:12:40.743
Yes, and I put the word up
there "staccato"

00:12:40.743 --> 00:12:42.980
as opposed to
"legato."

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:47.094
Mozart's piano does not lend
itself to legato lines,

00:12:47.094 --> 00:12:50.080
these lines that are tied
together.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.090
Think of your ligament. Right.
 

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:57.467
It's all etymologically related
to the word "ligare,"

00:12:57.467 --> 00:12:58.509
I suppose.
 

00:12:58.509 --> 00:13:02.048
So, legato: smooth, connected.
 

00:13:02.048 --> 00:13:05.129
But that's not the sound that
we get in Mozart's piano.

00:13:05.129 --> 00:13:07.450
We get this staccato,
as Roger says,

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:12.451
punchy sound so--and it's
because the hammers are actually

00:13:12.451 --> 00:13:15.649
made of leather,
kind of hard leather,

00:13:15.649 --> 00:13:16.960
rather than felt.
 

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.605
In the nineteenth century they
put felt on these hammers and it

00:13:20.605 --> 00:13:22.429
kind of smooths it out a bit.
 

00:13:22.429 --> 00:13:23.690
It makes it less punchy.
 

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.466
So those are a couple
characteristics of Mozart's

00:13:26.466 --> 00:13:26.928
piano.
 

00:13:26.928 --> 00:13:30.450
It tends to encourage fast,
staccato playing.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:35.168
All right. In 1791 Mozart dies.
 

00:13:35.168 --> 00:13:39.562
Beethoven had been originally
sent to Vienna to study with

00:13:39.562 --> 00:13:43.110
Mozart, but then there were
family problems.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:47.063
His mother died back in Bonn so
he had to go back and look after

00:13:47.063 --> 00:13:47.879
the family.
 

00:13:47.879 --> 00:13:50.558
Beethoven, like Mozart,
was a pianist,

00:13:50.558 --> 00:13:53.394
but unfortunately for
Beethoven, his teacher was his

00:13:53.394 --> 00:13:55.493
father,
a somewhat unscrupulous

00:13:55.493 --> 00:13:59.587
individual who tried to pass off
the rather short Beethoven as

00:13:59.587 --> 00:14:02.809
being two years younger than he
actually was.

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:04.259
Why would he want to do that?
 

00:14:04.259 --> 00:14:08.111
Well, oftentimes you get
kids--the cut-off in

00:14:08.111 --> 00:14:13.538
twelve-and-under soccer or USTA
tennis you are supposed to--

00:14:13.538 --> 00:14:16.076
you can't be sixteen before
that particular date and people

00:14:16.076 --> 00:14:18.220
will try to sneak over on the
other side of it.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:22.389
Well, because in terms of the
music of Beethoven here,

00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:25.350
the father wanted the son to be
the next Wunderkind,

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:27.830
right, the next child prodigy,
the next Mozart.

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:28.075
Why?
 

00:14:28.075 --> 00:14:30.899
Because money was to be made in
that fashion.

00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:33.558
The Mozart family had certainly
made enough of it that way.

00:14:33.558 --> 00:14:36.845
But eventually Beethoven broke
free of this tyrannical

00:14:36.845 --> 00:14:40.192
environment in Bonn and
established himself permanently

00:14:40.192 --> 00:14:41.058
in Vienna.
 

00:14:41.058 --> 00:14:41.749
Think about it.
 

00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:44.460
Bonn is at the very west end of
the German-speaking lands;

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.308
Vienna is off toward the east
end of the German-speaking land.

00:14:48.308 --> 00:14:50.831
So he went all the way to the
other side of it but Vienna,

00:14:50.831 --> 00:14:53.220
of course, was the musical
capital of the world at that

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.149
particular point.
 

00:14:54.149 --> 00:14:57.145
So here is what
Beethoven--young Beethoven

00:14:57.145 --> 00:15:01.750
looked like when he arrived in
Vienna permanently about 1797.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:02.610
Oh, forget it.
 

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.690
We'll--I forgot that slide but
it doesn't matter.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:07.190
Let's look at Beethoven here.
 

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:08.928
Here is young Beethoven.
 

00:15:08.928 --> 00:15:14.272
And here is middle-aged
Beethoven when he is writing

00:15:14.272 --> 00:15:20.243
things such as the Eighth
Symphony that we heard at the JE

00:15:20.243 --> 00:15:21.500
concert.
 

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:25.373
So we have Beethoven young,
Beethoven middle-aged and

00:15:25.373 --> 00:15:26.639
Beethoven dead.
 

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:27.038
Okay?
 

00:15:27.038 --> 00:15:29.509
That's Beethoven's death mask.
 

00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:33.057
The only reason I mentioned
this is that it was drawn by

00:15:33.057 --> 00:15:37.054
Joseph Dannhauser who also was
the artist who painted the cover

00:15:37.054 --> 00:15:38.408
of your textbook.
 

00:15:38.408 --> 00:15:42.529
We'll come back to that just a
little bit later.

00:15:42.529 --> 00:15:45.687
So when
Beethoven--let's--that's too

00:15:45.687 --> 00:15:46.678
ghoulish.
 

00:15:46.678 --> 00:15:49.639
Let's go back to Beethoven
looking a little better there.

00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:51.548
I like that better. Don't you?
 

00:15:51.548 --> 00:15:55.798
So with that vision of
Beethoven on the screen,

00:15:55.798 --> 00:15:59.495
let's make the point that when
he arrived in Vienna he

00:15:59.495 --> 00:16:03.538
astonished the aristocracy by
the power of his playing--

00:16:03.538 --> 00:16:06.879
the aggressive nature of it,
the physicality of it,

00:16:06.879 --> 00:16:08.200
the virtuosity of it.
 

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.721
It was much more technical than
anything that Mozart had ever

00:16:13.721 --> 00:16:17.548
created on the piano,
in part because gradually in

00:16:17.548 --> 00:16:20.726
this period the piano itself was
getting bigger and more

00:16:20.726 --> 00:16:21.418
powerful.
 

00:16:21.418 --> 00:16:26.178
So here is--let's move on now
over dead Beethoven's body here,

00:16:26.178 --> 00:16:29.501
and over to this piano,
which again comes from our own

00:16:29.501 --> 00:16:31.759
collection of musical
instruments.

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:36.803
It's a Konige piano of about--I
think we know exactly--1799 and

00:16:36.803 --> 00:16:41.849
it was made in Vienna two doors
down the street from where that

00:16:41.849 --> 00:16:43.070
casino was.
 

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:48.139
That's where the Konige shop
was in Vienna.

00:16:48.139 --> 00:16:51.844
So this is the kind of
instrument that Beethoven would

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:55.059
have played when he first
arrived in Vienna.

00:16:55.059 --> 00:16:56.788
It's a little bit bigger.
 

00:16:56.788 --> 00:16:59.090
It's got a few more keys added
to it.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:08.291
Then in 1817 Beethoven--well,
let me--let's move to the next

00:17:08.291 --> 00:17:09.538
slide.
 

00:17:09.538 --> 00:17:11.509
I want to show this to you just
for a moment.

00:17:11.509 --> 00:17:14.981
This--does this look like
something from the early

00:17:14.981 --> 00:17:18.029
nineteenth century,
picture of Beethoven?

00:17:18.029 --> 00:17:18.950
Actually not.
 

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:23.420
It was created in the 1920s,
not 1820s but 1920s.

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.984
It's a fanciful representation
of Beethoven and his musical

00:17:26.984 --> 00:17:29.259
study there with papers all
around.

00:17:29.259 --> 00:17:30.990
You see the ear trumpets on
either side;

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.140
he is growing deaf.
 

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.964
You see his bowl of coffee or
porridge or whatever on the

00:17:34.964 --> 00:17:35.519
keyboard.
 

00:17:35.519 --> 00:17:38.160
I'm interested here
particularly in the piano,

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.740
because what do we have back
there coming out of the piano?

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.854
A lot of broken strings,
okay, and that's important

00:17:45.854 --> 00:17:50.710
because when he played he would
frequently break strings.

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:54.900
Here, let's move on to the next
slide.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.446
It's also something of a
fanciful representation of

00:17:57.446 --> 00:18:00.198
Beethoven's room with the idea
of the moonlight and the

00:18:00.198 --> 00:18:02.440
"Moonlight Sonata"
behind it,

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:09.055
but it contains as a piano an
illustration of a Broadwood

00:18:09.055 --> 00:18:10.000
piano.
 

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.763
In 1817, the maker,
Broadwood, gave Beethoven a

00:18:15.763 --> 00:18:18.019
free instrument.
 

00:18:18.019 --> 00:18:21.130
Why would somebody do that?
 

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:22.640
Aren't these pianos expensive?
 

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.299
Let's go on to--I think I have
a shot of another one.

00:18:26.299 --> 00:18:27.980
This is not fanciful.
 

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.819
This is Beethoven's actual
instrument.

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:33.368
It is preserved today.
 

00:18:33.368 --> 00:18:35.886
It was purchased after
Beethoven's death by Franz

00:18:35.886 --> 00:18:37.538
Liszt,
the famous pianist,

00:18:37.538 --> 00:18:41.200
and taken to--ultimately to
Budapest and you can go into--

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.665
I did this two summers ago--you
can go into the National Museum

00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:47.549
there in Budapest,
and it's actually in Pest,

00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:49.920
and see this particular
instrument.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.269
So it still survives.
 

00:18:51.269 --> 00:18:54.152
And as you can see,
it's getting bigger and more

00:18:54.152 --> 00:18:57.710
powerful, but why would this
maker--English maker Broadwood

00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:59.980
give Beethoven a free
instrument?

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:00.849
These are expensive.
 

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:04.160
What?
 

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.328
Nice and loud.
 

00:19:05.328 --> 00:19:08.079
Student: Probably
&gt;

00:19:08.079 --> 00:19:09.450
Prof: Probably what?
 

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:10.740
Student:
&gt;

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.736
Prof: Publicity,
yeah, a celebrity endorsement.

00:19:14.736 --> 00:19:15.338
Right?
 

00:19:15.338 --> 00:19:18.190
Why does Tiger Woods drive a
Buick?

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.440
Do you think he really wants to
drive a Buick?

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.363
Okay, but
&gt;

00:19:21.363 --> 00:19:24.900
nonetheless in TV commercials
he's seen driving a Buick--a

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.064
celebrity endorsement,
and we'll be talking a little

00:19:28.064 --> 00:19:29.430
more about that.
 

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:33.249
So this is Beethoven's
Broadwood here,

00:19:33.249 --> 00:19:36.140
1817 still existing today.
 

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.470
Let's listen to a little bit of
it.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:38.868
We can make recordings.
 

00:19:38.868 --> 00:19:41.269
Specialists are allowed to make
recordings on it.

00:19:41.269 --> 00:19:44.574
So here is Beethoven
instrument, just a little bit

00:19:44.574 --> 00:19:47.609
out of a piece of this period by
Beethoven.

00:19:47.609 --> 00:20:35.380
&gt;
 

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:35.682
Okay.
 

00:20:35.682 --> 00:20:37.380
Maybe we'll pause it there.
 

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.828
So do you like that sound?
 

00:20:38.828 --> 00:20:41.089
Would you like to have that
piano in your house?

00:20:41.089 --> 00:20:43.390
Maybe; maybe not.
 

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:44.618
A lot of you are shaking your
heads.

00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:47.656
It sounds slightly out of tune
to me, and I think maybe the

00:20:47.656 --> 00:20:50.589
reason is that often with
Beethoven's piano there are two

00:20:50.589 --> 00:20:51.690
strings per note.
 

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.710
It's really hard to get two
strings exactly in tune.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:57.108
One string is what it is.
 

00:20:57.108 --> 00:21:00.180
Three strings you get the kind
of homogenization of sound.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.538
Two strings it's a bit more
difficult.

00:21:02.538 --> 00:21:04.154
I think it's the same thing
with singers,

00:21:04.154 --> 00:21:04.680
oddly, too.
 

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.948
When you're singing with two
people, it's a little more

00:21:07.948 --> 00:21:09.339
difficult to tune up.
 

00:21:09.339 --> 00:21:11.480
One or three it's not an issue.
 

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.148
So it does have this slightly
out-of-tune sound to it,

00:21:14.148 --> 00:21:16.415
but nonetheless,
that is Beethoven's Broadwood

00:21:16.415 --> 00:21:16.920
piano.
 

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.910
What did Beethoven write for
the piano?

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:25.980
Well, thirty-two piano sonatas
and five piano concertos,

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.568
the most famous of which,
and I put this on your--

00:21:29.568 --> 00:21:32.006
remember I gave you the
"Essential Beethoven"

00:21:32.006 --> 00:21:33.358
sheet a couple of weeks ago.
 

00:21:33.358 --> 00:21:36.184
The most important of these
piano concertos is the so-called

00:21:36.184 --> 00:21:37.670
"Emperor Concerto."
 

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:39.839
So we have the "Emperor
Quartet"

00:21:39.839 --> 00:21:42.009
by Haydn, the "Emperor
Concerto"

00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:42.910
by Beethoven.
 

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:46.817
So Beethoven wrote five piano
concertos, thirty-two piano

00:21:46.817 --> 00:21:51.144
sonatas, and these piano sonatas
were not so much like Mozart's

00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:52.538
teaching pieces.
 

00:21:52.538 --> 00:21:57.660
These were virtuosic pieces for
Beethoven himself to play.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.740
How well did he play them?
 

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.711
Well, you would think that he
would play them absolutely

00:22:02.711 --> 00:22:04.981
superbly but
that--contemporaries commented

00:22:04.981 --> 00:22:07.088
that his playing was kind of
messy.

00:22:07.088 --> 00:22:11.890
Here's what one of them said:
"His playing is not clean.

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:15.390
He has much fire,
but he pounds a bit too much.

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:19.394
He overcomes diabolical
difficulties but he does not do

00:22:19.394 --> 00:22:20.730
so neatly."
 

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:25.253
Maybe--possibly--why might
Beethoven have trouble as a

00:22:25.253 --> 00:22:28.670
performer here in the- in early
1800s?

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.809
What was Beethoven's issue?
 

00:22:31.809 --> 00:22:34.250
Caroline.
 

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:34.970
Student: He was going
deaf.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:38.038
Prof: He was going deaf
so if he pounded a bit too much

00:22:38.038 --> 00:22:41.615
perhaps it's understandable,
but here is the kind of sound

00:22:41.615 --> 00:22:43.194
perhaps--
oh, lordy.

00:22:43.194 --> 00:22:48.509
Here's the kind of sound that
the commenter might have had in

00:22:48.509 --> 00:22:50.990
mind, Beethoven pounding.
 

00:22:50.990 --> 00:23:27.170
&gt;
 

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:30.828
And I'm exaggerating a little
bit to get across that idea.

00:23:30.828 --> 00:23:34.118
Two points I guess:
one, what the piano could do

00:23:34.118 --> 00:23:36.776
for you,
with these extreme dynamics,

00:23:36.776 --> 00:23:39.290
and two,
perhaps Beethoven because of

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:42.578
his growing deafness was
pounding a bit too much.

00:23:42.578 --> 00:23:47.048
After Beethoven,
pianos only continued to get

00:23:47.048 --> 00:23:49.788
larger and more powerful.
 

00:23:49.788 --> 00:23:53.509
Let's take a look at some of
these later instruments.

00:23:53.509 --> 00:23:56.519
We're moving on now to a Graf
piano.

00:23:56.519 --> 00:23:59.710
Graf was another maker who gave
Beethoven an instrument.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:04.496
This comes--my own shot from
the collection of historical

00:24:04.496 --> 00:24:07.828
musical instruments in Vienna
itself.

00:24:07.828 --> 00:24:13.170
As time goes on here,
what we find is that in order--

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:20.180
as this instrument gets bigger
and we want a bigger soundboard,

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.792
that thing underneath--that's
the main resonator.

00:24:23.792 --> 00:24:24.318
Okay?
 

00:24:24.318 --> 00:24:27.557
We need a bigger soundboard
and, as this thing gets bigger

00:24:27.557 --> 00:24:30.795
and we want to put more tension
on these strings to really

00:24:30.795 --> 00:24:32.509
pound,
so we don't break them or they

00:24:32.509 --> 00:24:35.096
don't come loose,
we need some kind of iron

00:24:35.096 --> 00:24:35.779
support.
 

00:24:35.779 --> 00:24:38.981
So first they started putting
pieces of iron and then

00:24:38.981 --> 00:24:41.786
ultimately an entire frame,
a bed of iron,

00:24:41.786 --> 00:24:45.478
cast iron, underneath that
thing for that soundboard to

00:24:45.478 --> 00:24:46.230
rest in.
 

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:50.431
Then we need the--at the other
end we need a pin block and that

00:24:50.431 --> 00:24:54.498
pin block has to be very secure
because that's where the pins

00:24:54.498 --> 00:24:57.480
that anchor the strings are
going to be.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.871
Most of the problems--if you
think you've got a deal on a

00:25:00.871 --> 00:25:03.051
piano sometime,
check your pin block,

00:25:03.051 --> 00:25:04.930
because you probably don't.
 

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.913
It probably has cracks in it
and then you go to tighten that

00:25:07.913 --> 00:25:09.719
thing,
get your instrument tuned,

00:25:09.719 --> 00:25:12.780
the next day it's back out of
tune because that pin block is

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:13.558
not holding.
 

00:25:13.558 --> 00:25:16.480
So you have to have a very
secure pin block.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.330
You have to have a big
resonator and in order for that

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:22.558
to be helpful on--you need the
cast iron frame underneath.

00:25:22.558 --> 00:25:27.913
All of these things allow for a
bigger, more powerful instrument

00:25:27.913 --> 00:25:29.868
to be put into place.
 

00:25:29.868 --> 00:25:33.096
So this is a Graf,
as I say, from the collection

00:25:33.096 --> 00:25:33.920
in Vienna.
 

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.960
The range of the instrument is
getting bigger;

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.318
the sound of the instrument is
getting bigger.

00:25:39.318 --> 00:25:42.130
Let's go on to the next slide
here.

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:44.940
Here is young Franz Schubert
about your age,

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:48.204
young Franz Schubert writing
the kinds of pieces that we used

00:25:48.204 --> 00:25:50.220
in the review section for
example,

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.690
and here is the piano that he
was playing,

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:58.269
also a Graf instrument in the
Schubert Museum there in Vienna.

00:25:58.269 --> 00:26:02.125
The Graf instrument was also
given not only to Schubert and

00:26:02.125 --> 00:26:04.720
to Beethoven but also to Franz
Liszt.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.690
Let's take a look at this,
another Graf.

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:11.819
Let's move on to this.
 

00:26:11.819 --> 00:26:14.490
This, of course, is what?
 

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:15.960
Where have you seen this before?
 

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.160
Cover of the textbook.
 

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.369
What is this?
 

00:26:19.369 --> 00:26:21.568
This is a marketing tool.
 

00:26:21.568 --> 00:26:26.470
Did these people that included
Georges Sand,

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:31.625
Alexander Dumas père,
Victor Hugo,

00:26:31.625 --> 00:26:36.444
Rossini, Paganini--did they
ever come together and pose for

00:26:36.444 --> 00:26:37.108
this?
 

00:26:37.108 --> 00:26:37.259
No.
 

00:26:37.259 --> 00:26:39.368
They were in completely
different cities.

00:26:39.368 --> 00:26:42.948
This is a marketing--I was
looking at a Brooks Brothers

00:26:42.948 --> 00:26:45.930
thing that seemed to be shot in
Princeton,

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.079
but if you look carefully it
had all of these brown leaves on

00:26:49.079 --> 00:26:52.074
the thing and the people had
been patched in there and the

00:26:52.074 --> 00:26:54.700
trees around the thing they were
all in bloom.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.269
This is a hodgepodge.
 

00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:59.803
Well, this is a hodgepodge too,
but it's kind of an interesting

00:26:59.803 --> 00:27:03.278
one because it tells us a little
bit about what the nineteenth

00:27:03.278 --> 00:27:05.160
century thought of Beethoven.
 

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.130
Let's go to this last slide
here.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:09.282
So here's Franz Liszt,
the famous Franz Liszt,

00:27:09.282 --> 00:27:10.240
playing the piano.
 

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.868
He has the historian Marie
d'Agoult;

00:27:12.868 --> 00:27:16.958
his paramour at his knees there
in a typical nineteenth-century

00:27:16.958 --> 00:27:19.200
supplicatory position for women.
 

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.578
And up at the top,
who do we have?

00:27:21.578 --> 00:27:25.402
The bust of Beethoven at an
Olympian height looking down

00:27:25.402 --> 00:27:28.460
over the proceedings,
blessing Liszt and most

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.308
importantly, blessing the Graf
piano.

00:27:31.308 --> 00:27:35.818
Well, Liszt did play a Graf
piano.

00:27:35.818 --> 00:27:39.279
Let's listen to--and we're
going to have a slide here of

00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:40.160
Franz Liszt.
 

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.608
Let's go on to the next slide.
 

00:27:41.608 --> 00:27:42.071
Oh, no.
 

00:27:42.071 --> 00:27:45.703
Well, there's one other
composer I should mention that's

00:27:45.703 --> 00:27:47.288
a wonderful composer.
 

00:27:47.288 --> 00:27:50.256
I don't have time to do
anything really with him in this

00:27:50.256 --> 00:27:53.170
course, but he's one of my
favorite, Fredric Chopin.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:56.660
Here's Chopin playing a Pleyel
piano.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:00.070
And we have over with our
collection a Pleyel right--not

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:03.670
his piano but right from the
period that he was playing.

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:06.278
And let's go on now.
 

00:28:06.278 --> 00:28:10.920
It should be the portrait of--I
got them out of order.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.429
All right.
 

00:28:11.429 --> 00:28:14.589
Let's go on to the portrait of
Liszt here, portrait of Liszt.

00:28:14.589 --> 00:28:16.048
Here is Franz Liszt.
 

00:28:16.048 --> 00:28:23.101
And let's go back one now and
here is an Erard piano that

00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:24.990
Liszt played.
 

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:27.159
He actually--it's actually in
the collection of Buckingham

00:28:27.159 --> 00:28:29.753
Palace,
but when Liszt went there and

00:28:29.753 --> 00:28:33.865
played for the queen--
for Queen Victoria he played on

00:28:33.865 --> 00:28:36.450
this particular Erard
instrument.

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:40.710
So it looks very much like a
modern instrument.

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.630
Let's hear just a little bit of
Liszt's music.

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:48.380
You have it as CD four,
track one.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.444
It's a "Transcendental
Etude," a sort of hugely

00:28:51.444 --> 00:28:53.798
difficult technical study by
Franz Liszt.

00:28:53.798 --> 00:28:55.960
Let's listen to just a bit of
Liszt playing.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:49.000
&gt;
 

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.380
Okay. We'll stop it there.
 

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:52.509
So this is called a study.
 

00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:55.410
There's some irony here.
 

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:59.163
It's called a study in
order--you play this piece and

00:29:59.163 --> 00:30:00.390
you get better.
 

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:01.328
Okay?
 

00:30:01.328 --> 00:30:04.720
Now how good would you have to
be to begin with to play this

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.180
piece?
 

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:06.828
Holy schmoly.
 

00:30:06.828 --> 00:30:09.578
This is really difficult
technically.

00:30:09.578 --> 00:30:12.078
Dan, have you ever played a
Liszt transcendental etude?

00:30:12.078 --> 00:30:12.471
Oh, he has.
 

00:30:12.471 --> 00:30:14.647
Well, we should have gotten him
to play a Liszt transcendental

00:30:14.647 --> 00:30:14.970
etude.
 

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:16.480
It's kind of the top of the
line.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:20.060
My guess is that in Liszt's day
there probably were six or seven

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:23.073
people in all of Europe that
could actually play these

00:30:23.073 --> 00:30:26.483
studies that were designed to
get you to be a more proficient

00:30:26.483 --> 00:30:27.278
pianist.
 

00:30:27.278 --> 00:30:30.663
We were kind of out of the game
before the game even began in an

00:30:30.663 --> 00:30:31.200
odd way.
 

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.670
So this is Liszt's Erard piano.
 

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:39.661
I want to show just a couple
more slides and then we'll

00:30:39.661 --> 00:30:40.880
introduce our guest.
 

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.410
And we've seen the portrait of
Liszt.

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:47.673
I was struck when--at the Liszt
Museum in Budapest that when you

00:30:47.673 --> 00:30:51.666
walk in there and you see that
Liszt played in his home--and

00:30:51.666 --> 00:30:52.750
there it is.
 

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:56.180
It's a big instrument with two
pedals down there.

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:59.211
It's a Chickering instrument
and you know where that

00:30:59.211 --> 00:31:00.519
instrument was made?
 

00:31:00.519 --> 00:31:02.240
In Boston.
 

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:06.017
So Boston was a major--and New
York also here in the

00:31:06.017 --> 00:31:09.348
1860s-1870s a major
manufacturing center ,

00:31:09.348 --> 00:31:14.282
and they shipped one all the
way to Budapest for Liszt to

00:31:14.282 --> 00:31:14.900
play.
 

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.650
And a fine, fine piano indeed.
 

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:20.838
A couple more and then we're
going to stop.

00:31:20.838 --> 00:31:24.578
And of course when Liszt died
they were particularly--

00:31:24.578 --> 00:31:27.988
not so much interested in doing
a death mask of his face but one

00:31:27.988 --> 00:31:30.181
of his hand,
because he was thought to have

00:31:30.181 --> 00:31:33.037
a very unusual sort of webbing
between his fingers that allowed

00:31:33.037 --> 00:31:35.568
him to stretch in ways that
other pianists couldn't.

00:31:35.568 --> 00:31:38.640
A few more and then,
as I say, we'll stop.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.970
This is an interesting piano.
 

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:44.970
Liszt's son-in-law was Richard
Wagner.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:47.058
You can read about--all about
this in the textbook.

00:31:47.058 --> 00:31:51.405
Liszt's son-in-law was Richard
Wagner and Wagner composed at

00:31:51.405 --> 00:31:52.288
the piano.
 

00:31:52.288 --> 00:31:55.092
Mozart generally didn't,
but Wagner did,

00:31:55.092 --> 00:31:59.548
and this is the instrument that
was involved at the end portion

00:31:59.548 --> 00:32:03.068
of the composing of his opera
Tristan.

00:32:03.068 --> 00:32:05.442
And we heard parts of
Tristan.

00:32:05.442 --> 00:32:05.970
Right?
 

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:10.001
We heard the Liebestod
out of Tristan so it may

00:32:10.001 --> 00:32:13.564
have been on this very
instrument that Wagner composed

00:32:13.564 --> 00:32:15.109
part of that music.
 

00:32:15.109 --> 00:32:17.849
Where is this instrument today?
 

00:32:17.849 --> 00:32:20.380
Right down the street.
 

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.828
It's in that same collection of
historical musical instruments.

00:32:23.828 --> 00:32:27.056
This is what we call the Wagner
piano over there on Hillhouse

00:32:27.056 --> 00:32:27.538
Avenue.
 

00:32:27.538 --> 00:32:30.190
So pop in someday to 17
Hillhouse Avenue.

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:32.824
Go up to the second floor and
you can see all these historic

00:32:32.824 --> 00:32:33.450
instruments.
 

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:36.818
It's the greatest collection of
keyboard instruments in the

00:32:36.818 --> 00:32:40.071
entire Western hemisphere,
right here, and it's virtually

00:32:40.071 --> 00:32:40.769
unknown.
 

00:32:40.769 --> 00:32:42.210
So that's Wagner's piano.
 

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:45.090
What's of interest is see how
those lines are going straight

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:45.970
out to the back.
 

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:50.623
They're simply braces helping
the soundboard there,

00:32:50.623 --> 00:32:56.299
and the strings are running at
right angles to the line of the

00:32:56.299 --> 00:32:57.509
keyboard.
 

00:32:57.509 --> 00:33:01.460
But things didn't stay that
way, interestingly enough,

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.269
because as time went on,
there was a German

00:33:04.269 --> 00:33:06.309
manufacturer--
this is actually a

00:33:06.309 --> 00:33:09.058
Bechstein--there was another
German manufacturer,

00:33:09.058 --> 00:33:13.102
however, with the name of
Steinweg who immigrated to the

00:33:13.102 --> 00:33:16.410
United States and set up in New
York City,

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:19.500
and of course that Steinweg
became what?

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.260
Steinway.
 

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:24.240
Steinway piano manufacturers of
New York City.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:28.220
And they instituted a couple of
changes.

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:31.351
But most importantly they
instituted this idea of

00:33:31.351 --> 00:33:35.461
cross-stringing where instead of
having the bass strings run out

00:33:35.461 --> 00:33:39.308
in a straight line they took
them and run them up over.

00:33:39.308 --> 00:33:41.607
And next time you're at a grand
piano--maybe come up afterwards

00:33:41.607 --> 00:33:42.980
today--to look at the bass
strings.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.818
They run up over the other
strings.

00:33:44.818 --> 00:33:49.078
What this gives is a much more
homogenous kind of sound.

00:33:49.078 --> 00:33:51.838
It's a much more homophonic
instrument.

00:33:51.838 --> 00:33:54.465
Ironically, the Wagner piano,
when you play it,

00:33:54.465 --> 00:33:55.380
is very clear.
 

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:58.799
You don't get this kind of wash
of sounds, because the strings

00:33:58.799 --> 00:34:01.660
are, as you can see,
a little bit more separated.

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:05.989
And here--this may be our last
slide--is what we end up with at

00:34:05.989 --> 00:34:10.110
the piano, a sort of gilded
Steinway from the gilded age.

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:12.389
This is actually up in the
Clark Museum in Williamstown,

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:16.239
Massachusetts,
but it is a Steinway piano,

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:19.175
and you can see on it three
pedals and this is my last

00:34:19.175 --> 00:34:19.619
point.
 

00:34:19.619 --> 00:34:23.003
Initially, all the panels up
into the Steinway there you saw

00:34:23.003 --> 00:34:26.099
just two pedals underneath,
and these are the two we're

00:34:26.099 --> 00:34:27.820
going to talk about today.
 

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:31.090
The right-most pedal is called
the sustaining pedal.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:32.179
&gt;
 

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:37.820
Play that and the sound goes
away because there are dampers.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.079
There are pieces of felt up on
top of the string,

00:34:39.079 --> 00:34:39.840
&gt;
 

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.300
but I can lift all those pieces
of felt, those dampers,

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.396
just by pushing that pedal
down, and then I get

00:34:44.396 --> 00:34:45.809
&gt;
 

00:34:45.809 --> 00:34:48.670
so the dampers are now up.
 

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:52.010
So we call this the sustaining
pedal or the damper pedal,

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:53.800
sustaining pedal more often.
 

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.179
&gt;
 

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:56.599
And the other one is the one
all the way to the left.

00:34:56.599 --> 00:34:59.010
You can--what's happening here?
 

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:00.849
A.J., look at the keyboard here
if you will.

00:35:00.849 --> 00:35:02.460
What's happening?
 

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.050
Can you see what's happening to
the keyboard as I push that left

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:05.380
pedal?
 

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.710
Chris, Daniel.
 

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.840
Student:
&gt;

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.918
Prof: Yeah,
it's wiggling.

00:35:07.918 --> 00:35:08.659
It's going this way.
 

00:35:08.659 --> 00:35:10.619
What's happening is these
groups--units of three strings

00:35:10.619 --> 00:35:12.543
are all sliding so that when you
hit the- &lt;&lt;plays

00:35:12.543 --> 00:35:13.150
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.318
that way you're--now instead of
hitting three strings

00:35:15.318 --> 00:35:16.530
&gt;
 

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:17.900
you're hitting only two strings.
 

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:22.068
It makes the sound softer by
shifting the whole keyboard and

00:35:22.068 --> 00:35:26.166
hammer mechanism so only two
strings are engaged instead of

00:35:26.166 --> 00:35:29.840
three and that makes the sound a
lot more quiet.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.110
All right.
 

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:38.000
That does it for the specifics
of today.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.150
Let's introduce our guest.
 

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:41.920
So Dan, come on up, please.
 

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:45.800
Daniel Schlossberg Jr.,
Yale College.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.039
What college?
 

00:35:47.039 --> 00:35:48.269
Is it Pierson, Daniel?
 

00:35:48.269 --> 00:35:49.590
Yeah, he's in Pierson.
 

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.309
How many of you know Daniel?
 

00:35:51.309 --> 00:35:51.829
Daniel Schlossberg:
Branford.

00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:52.893
Prof: Branford.
 

00:35:52.893 --> 00:35:53.378
Oh, sorry.
 

00:35:53.378 --> 00:35:53.960
I'm sorry.
 

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.646
That's right.
 

00:35:54.646 --> 00:35:56.230
I guess that was in Branford.
 

00:35:56.230 --> 00:36:01.699
I heard a recital of him in
Branford.

00:36:01.699 --> 00:36:04.710
So Dan is a junior now.
 

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:05.840
He's a music major.
 

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.190
I--right? You're a music major.
 

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:10.373
Any double majors or anything
like that?

00:36:10.373 --> 00:36:11.101
You just--no.
 

00:36:11.101 --> 00:36:11.550
Okay.
 

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:16.195
Sometimes, you know--Kensho's
out there doing microbiology and

00:36:16.195 --> 00:36:18.708
music, but Dan is also a
composer.

00:36:18.708 --> 00:36:19.469
Right?
 

00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:22.639
Dan does a lot of composing so
he's really into music in a

00:36:22.639 --> 00:36:24.920
serious--do you do any
conducting, Dan?

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.900
Daniel Schlossberg:
A little bit.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.449
Prof: A little bit of
conducting,

00:36:27.449 --> 00:36:30.748
and maybe at the end of the
semester it'd be fun when we get

00:36:30.748 --> 00:36:33.192
to modern music to have--
do a piece by Dan,

00:36:33.192 --> 00:36:36.146
bring in a piece by Dan and we
could have him come back as

00:36:36.146 --> 00:36:37.079
guest composer.
 

00:36:37.079 --> 00:36:39.989
So how long have you been
playing piano?

00:36:39.989 --> 00:36:42.782
Daniel Schlossberg:
First grade

00:36:42.782 --> 00:36:44.820
&gt;
 

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:45.539
Prof: All right. Okay.
 

00:36:45.539 --> 00:36:47.092
First grade,
six, seven, something like

00:36:47.092 --> 00:36:47.380
that.
 

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.909
Are your parents musical?
 

00:36:49.909 --> 00:36:50.679
Daniel Schlossberg:
Not at all.

00:36:50.679 --> 00:36:51.980
Prof: Not at all.
 

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:52.751
Daniel Schlossberg:
No.

00:36:52.751 --> 00:36:54.400
I mean, they play guitar and
piano &gt;

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.750
Prof: Well,
that's kind of musical.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:59.460
Right, but they're--so they're
not professional musicians.

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:04.440
And any relatives in music at
all?

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.668
Daniel Schlossberg:
No.

00:37:05.668 --> 00:37:06.219
Not really.
 

00:37:06.219 --> 00:37:07.449
Prof: Not really.
 

00:37:07.449 --> 00:37:11.820
So--and I hate to embarrass
people, but this is something

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.239
that fascinates me--your ear.
 

00:37:14.239 --> 00:37:16.398
I--it's--I always think
you--it's--you got to have a

00:37:16.398 --> 00:37:18.389
really good ear to be able to do
what you do.

00:37:18.389 --> 00:37:20.820
How good is your ear?
 

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:22.797
Daniel Schlossberg:
Well, in terms of what?

00:37:22.797 --> 00:37:24.170
Perfect pitch or absolute
pitch?

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:26.579
Prof: Presumably you
don't have absolute pitch.

00:37:26.579 --> 00:37:28.077
Daniel Schlossberg:
No.

00:37:28.077 --> 00:37:31.329
I don't have absolute pitch but
I'm pretty close and sometimes I

00:37:31.329 --> 00:37:33.568
can identify notes--
Prof: Okay.

00:37:33.568 --> 00:37:36.731
So if we played something for
you and told you what the first

00:37:36.731 --> 00:37:39.210
note is, you would get the notes
thereafter.

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:40.764
Daniel Schlossberg:
Actually,

00:37:40.764 --> 00:37:43.163
I think if you just played a
note I could also identify

00:37:43.163 --> 00:37:44.630
it--on the piano,
definitely.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:45.672
Prof: Oh,
really.

00:37:45.672 --> 00:37:46.489
How interesting.
 

00:37:46.489 --> 00:37:49.335
So you do have absolute pitch
for--and I think this is

00:37:49.335 --> 00:37:52.289
true--that some brains are wired
for absolute pitch with

00:37:52.289 --> 00:37:53.739
particular instruments.
 

00:37:53.739 --> 00:37:56.016
I get pretty close on the
trumpet because when I was in

00:37:56.016 --> 00:37:58.293
the fourth grade I had to play
in a band kind of thing,

00:37:58.293 --> 00:37:59.179
play the trumpet.
 

00:37:59.179 --> 00:38:03.141
So if at a young age you get
locked into some instruments,

00:38:03.141 --> 00:38:06.340
those particular pitches can
stick with you.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:07.179
That's interesting.
 

00:38:07.179 --> 00:38:10.190
So almost absolute pitch here.
 

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.329
So that's one thing I wanted to
ask you about.

00:38:12.329 --> 00:38:15.050
Because if you have a sense of
pitch and if you hear--

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:19.159
if you know that in playing a
piece if I go out there--

00:38:19.159 --> 00:38:22.369
what happens when somebody
plays a piece of music?

00:38:22.369 --> 00:38:24.969
Lots of things are going on.
 

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:27.833
Why do I, Craig,
have memory lapses,

00:38:27.833 --> 00:38:31.679
when Dan probably doesn't have
memory lapses?

00:38:31.679 --> 00:38:33.489
Because he probably has a
better ear,

00:38:33.489 --> 00:38:35.409
he can remember this more,
he can stream it out there,

00:38:35.409 --> 00:38:37.750
and he knows--he hears that
inside of his head

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:39.050
&gt;
 

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:41.215
and he knows,
"oh, that's probably an A

00:38:41.215 --> 00:38:43.983
and if I want that sound I know
to go to that particular

00:38:43.983 --> 00:38:44.739
spot."
 

00:38:44.739 --> 00:38:50.192
I'm not sure what the sound is
in my head and I sure don't know

00:38:50.192 --> 00:38:51.951
quickly,
instantaneously,

00:38:51.951 --> 00:38:54.375
where that thing is,
and this stuff is going by

00:38:54.375 --> 00:38:57.458
blazingly fast so your mind's
got to be wired for it to begin

00:38:57.458 --> 00:38:57.869
with.
 

00:38:57.869 --> 00:39:01.659
I think it--it's a huge benefit
to have a really good ear even

00:39:01.659 --> 00:39:03.090
if you are a pianist.
 

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:06.092
Another question:
Do you ever get nervous when

00:39:06.092 --> 00:39:07.159
you play, Dan?
 

00:39:07.159 --> 00:39:08.159
Daniel Schlossberg:
Yes.

00:39:08.159 --> 00:39:08.659
All the time.
 

00:39:08.659 --> 00:39:10.528
Prof: All the time.
 

00:39:10.528 --> 00:39:13.909
Well, think about that,
nerves and performers.

00:39:13.909 --> 00:39:17.079
Jacob, do you ever get nervous
when you play?

00:39:17.079 --> 00:39:19.510
Student: Absolutely.
 

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.590
Prof: Do you take drugs,
Jacob, &gt;

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:22.860
&gt;
 

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:26.510
recreationally,
pharmacologically?

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:27.510
&gt;
 

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:31.070
Actually, musicians--has
anybody ever heard of this?

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:35.219
Musicians do take drugs for
this, beta-blockers to kind of

00:39:35.219 --> 00:39:37.529
relax them,
to lower their heart rate,

00:39:37.529 --> 00:39:39.505
French horn players--
I have a friend who is a

00:39:39.505 --> 00:39:40.760
professional French horn
player--

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:44.719
just to kind of get you to
settle a little bit,

00:39:44.719 --> 00:39:46.619
because if you play these
instruments,

00:39:46.619 --> 00:39:49.242
and it's just a question of a
fraction of an inch and you're

00:39:49.242 --> 00:39:51.121
like this,
my God, a string player,

00:39:51.121 --> 00:39:54.106
it's a catastrophe,
and then things start going

00:39:54.106 --> 00:39:54.789
downhill.
 

00:39:54.789 --> 00:39:56.050
&gt;
 

00:39:56.050 --> 00:40:01.856
So these are the kinds of mind
games I think that performers

00:40:01.856 --> 00:40:03.530
have to engage.
 

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:06.407
So do you take lessons here,
Dan, at the School of Music?

00:40:06.407 --> 00:40:08.360
Are you studying with anybody
there?

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.929
Dan Schlossberg:
With Wei-Yi Yang.

00:40:09.929 --> 00:40:11.492
Prof: Okay.
 

00:40:11.492 --> 00:40:16.097
He is one of the artist
teachers over at the School of

00:40:16.097 --> 00:40:16.880
Music.
 

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.411
Do you get any time to
practice?

00:40:18.411 --> 00:40:19.550
This is a busy place.
 

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:20.449
Dan Schlossberg: Hardly.
 

00:40:20.449 --> 00:40:22.610
Prof: Hardly--no time to
practice.

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:26.766
That's the great dilemma for
Yale--really good performers at

00:40:26.766 --> 00:40:27.260
Yale.
 

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.110
There's just no time to
practice.

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:32.777
What do you want to do-- what
do you think you want to do with

00:40:32.777 --> 00:40:33.739
this music business?
 

00:40:33.739 --> 00:40:36.552
Dan Schlossberg:
I would love to play,

00:40:36.552 --> 00:40:39.429
compose, conduct if possible,
everything--

00:40:39.429 --> 00:40:40.280
Prof: Mm-hm.
 

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.659
So how are you going to connect
the dots?

00:40:42.659 --> 00:40:45.449
How are you going to get from
Dan here, point A,

00:40:45.449 --> 00:40:47.409
to Dan here ten years from now?
 

00:40:47.409 --> 00:40:50.219
How do you plan to do that?
 

00:40:50.219 --> 00:40:51.730
Dan Schlossberg:
I don't know.

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:53.615
Grad school--
Prof: Probably grad

00:40:53.615 --> 00:40:53.960
school.
 

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:57.161
Yeah, you got to--for better or
for worse you got to get the

00:40:57.161 --> 00:40:59.929
diploma, the certificate that
says I can do this.

00:40:59.929 --> 00:41:02.891
Well, if you don't--it may or
may not make you any better

00:41:02.891 --> 00:41:04.159
&gt;
 

00:41:04.159 --> 00:41:07.717
but you sort of have to get it
to get the--it may make you

00:41:07.717 --> 00:41:08.090
worse.
 

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:09.090
I don't know.
 

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:11.360
You sort of have to get it to
get the gig.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:11.952
Okay.
 

00:41:11.952 --> 00:41:18.364
So let's talk about--let's talk
a little bit about this

00:41:18.364 --> 00:41:22.518
Beethoven sonata we've got here.
 

00:41:22.518 --> 00:41:27.090
It's an interesting piece,
because it's so short,

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:28.885
in a way--
Dan Schlossberg:

00:41:28.885 --> 00:41:29.880
Ten minutes,
the whole piece.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.179
Prof: Uh-huh. Okay.
 

00:41:31.179 --> 00:41:35.980
So ten minutes and it--when you
went to the-- How many of you

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:38.539
went to the JE makeup concert?
 

00:41:38.539 --> 00:41:39.489
Okay.
 

00:41:39.489 --> 00:41:43.507
Remember that Eighth Symphony
and how quickly that went

00:41:43.507 --> 00:41:45.739
through sonata-allegro form?
 

00:41:45.739 --> 00:41:49.018
There was a period with
Beethoven about 1810 or so when

00:41:49.018 --> 00:41:52.721
he started writing very small
things again after the Fifth and

00:41:52.721 --> 00:41:56.181
Sixth symphonies and then he
sort of pulled back and wrote

00:41:56.181 --> 00:41:59.643
kind of almost neo-classical
things and then at the end of

00:41:59.643 --> 00:42:03.650
his life really expanded out
into the realm of the cosmos.

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:05.489
So this is a kind of pulling
back here.

00:42:05.489 --> 00:42:08.940
What's hard in this piece, Dan?
 

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:12.706
What--
Dan Schlossberg:

00:42:12.706 --> 00:42:16.349
It's so condensed that you
really have to invest everything

00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:17.289
in each note.
 

00:42:17.289 --> 00:42:20.532
With some Beethoven,
it's so long that you have to

00:42:20.532 --> 00:42:24.505
think a lot more in terms of a
broader scale but in this case

00:42:24.505 --> 00:42:28.012
there's a prelude and the
musical idea is so condensed

00:42:28.012 --> 00:42:31.586
that you really have to focus
hard and make appropriate

00:42:31.586 --> 00:42:33.639
contrasts quickly,
etc.

00:42:33.639 --> 00:42:34.898
Prof: Okay.
 

00:42:34.898 --> 00:42:37.554
Technically,
is this the most difficult

00:42:37.554 --> 00:42:41.190
piece that you have ever played
from the sheer--

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:42.059
Dan Schlossberg:
&gt;

00:42:42.059 --> 00:42:42.726
Prof: Okay.
 

00:42:42.726 --> 00:42:43.579
&gt;
 

00:42:43.579 --> 00:42:45.530
Yeah, well, we have another one.
 

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:49.869
In other words,
this is not a dazzler.

00:42:49.869 --> 00:42:52.422
We've saved a bit of a dazzler
for the end of this 'cause I did

00:42:52.422 --> 00:42:54.440
want to show you how well this
young man plays.

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:58.179
So let's just listen to the
Beethoven then.

00:42:58.179 --> 00:43:01.389
Do you want to do--I beg your
pardon.

00:43:01.389 --> 00:43:02.119
Dan Schlossberg:
&gt;

00:43:02.119 --> 00:43:02.978
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:43:02.978 --> 00:43:03.789
Let's not do it.
 

00:43:03.789 --> 00:43:05.349
We're going to let the cat out
of the bag here.

00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:06.860
He's not going to repeat the
exposition--

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:08.757
Dan Schlossberg:
And also in this case the

00:43:08.757 --> 00:43:10.416
development is--
Prof: Right.

00:43:10.416 --> 00:43:12.996
Actually, if you look at the
score Beethoven wanted the

00:43:12.996 --> 00:43:15.099
development and the recap also
repeated,

00:43:15.099 --> 00:43:17.893
but I think in order to get the
next more technically demanding

00:43:17.893 --> 00:43:20.577
piece in we're just going--
Dan is kind enough to do it

00:43:20.577 --> 00:43:21.699
just without repeats.
 

00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:24.219
I don't mean to upstage you
here, but I'm just going to--we

00:43:24.219 --> 00:43:25.869
have to sort of teach as we do
this.

00:43:25.869 --> 00:43:28.503
It can't just be a concert so
I'm just going to discreetly

00:43:28.503 --> 00:43:30.030
point where we are in the form.
 

00:43:30.030 --> 00:46:59.960
&gt;
 

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:06.980
&gt;
 

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:09.380
Okay, a wonderful piece.
 

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.768
Again Beethoven's sort of
pulling in just a bit there,

00:47:11.768 --> 00:47:13.119
and a wonderful performance.
 

00:47:13.119 --> 00:47:16.862
I think we have time now for
the second piece,

00:47:16.862 --> 00:47:19.940
which is by the composer
Scarlatti.

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:24.536
In the Baroque period,
Handel, Bach,

00:47:24.536 --> 00:47:30.710
Scarlatti were all composing in
the same period,

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:33.469
all born in 1685.
 

00:47:33.469 --> 00:47:37.230
This piece is a sonata by
Scarlatti.

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:38.449
It's in one movement.
 

00:47:38.449 --> 00:47:40.630
It goes by rather quickly.
 

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:43.606
Shall we take--maybe we should
skip repeats here too,

00:47:43.606 --> 00:47:44.579
if that's okay.
 

00:47:44.579 --> 00:47:47.150
So it has a binary form.
 

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:51.009
We have an A section and then a
B section and then both of those

00:47:51.009 --> 00:47:53.460
binaries are going to come back
again.

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:55.679
I'll sort of--no,
I won't do that.

00:47:55.679 --> 00:47:58.965
It's just in the way,
but the A section has lots of

00:47:58.965 --> 00:48:03.106
this kind of Spanish quick sound
and the B section you'll hear a

00:48:03.106 --> 00:48:06.130
rising sequence coming up out of
the bass.

00:48:06.130 --> 00:49:41.409
&gt;
 

00:49:41.409 --> 00:49:42.329
Bravo.
 

00:49:42.329 --> 00:49:48.030
&gt;
 

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:49.590
Great. Thank you very much.
 

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:51.039
Wonderful. Thank you.
 

00:49:51.039 --> 00:49:52.510
Okay. That's it for today.
 

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:55.099
See you in section starting
tonight.

00:49:55.099 --> 00:49:55.900
&gt;
 

00:49:55.900 --> 00:50:01.000

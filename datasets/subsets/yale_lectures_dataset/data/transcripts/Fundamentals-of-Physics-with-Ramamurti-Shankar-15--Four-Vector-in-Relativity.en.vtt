00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.493
This is the last and final
chapter of this subject,

00:00:05.493 --> 00:00:08.751
and I think it's,
again--we're starting by

00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:13.440
backing off a little bit towards
the end of last class.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.237
I think that there are maybe
parts of it were maybe difficult

00:00:16.237 --> 00:00:18.730
for you to follow.
Let me remind you of what we

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.222
were trying to do.
We had learned that space-time

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:26.275
is described by four
coordinates, so that if you're

00:00:26.275 --> 00:00:29.600
following some particle or some
event,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.765
you label it with four numbers
c, t, x,

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:36.690
y and z,
which I want you to let me

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.630
combine into the single vector
r.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.271
They are written as
x_0,

00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:46.094
x_1,
x_2,

00:00:46.094 --> 00:00:49.362
x_3.
Now, I'm of two minds about

00:00:49.362 --> 00:00:51.090
x_2 and
x_3;

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.090
sometimes I carry them around,
sometimes I don't.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.050
x_1 is just
our familiar x;

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.185
x_2 is
y and

00:00:57.185 --> 00:00:58.320
x_3 is
z.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.085
It's possible to arrange all
the motion to take place in the

00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:03.375
x direction,
in which case y and

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:06.540
z don't change when you
go from one frame to the other,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.420
so I don't usually bother with
that.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.332
But sometimes I put it back
because if you have only two

00:01:11.332 --> 00:01:14.510
components, x_0
and x_1,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.147
you might say,
"Hey, the world is two

00:01:16.147 --> 00:01:17.946
dimensional."
So, I want to keep reminding

00:01:17.946 --> 00:01:19.900
you now we think of it terms of
four dimensions.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.191
So, at least for that reason
sometimes they carry all the

00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:26.189
three components of position,
sometimes only one.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.634
But I'm sure you guys can
figure out from the context

00:01:29.634 --> 00:01:33.084
which is which.
So, going back to the simpler

00:01:33.084 --> 00:01:37.412
situation of only x and
time, the point of those

00:01:37.412 --> 00:01:41.660
coordinates is that if you went
to a moving frame,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.130
x_1 prime will
be x_1 -

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.140
βx_0,
divided by the square root.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.413
And x_0 prime
will be x_0 -

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:56.160
β times
x_1,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.491
divided by that square root,
where β is

00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:02.853
v/c.
Sometimes it's useful to

00:02:02.853 --> 00:02:06.838
introduce γ,
which is [reciprocal of square

00:02:06.838 --> 00:02:09.150
root of ]
1 - u^(2)/c^(2).

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.017
Also to prevent all confusion,
u will be the velocity

00:02:13.017 --> 00:02:17.043
of your frame relative to mine.
v will stand for the

00:02:17.043 --> 00:02:20.699
velocity of some particle that
we are both studying.

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:23.621
So, let's reserve the symbol
v for motion of actual

00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:25.620
particles, which is why we are
there.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.770
We are all observers but we're
observing something.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.328
That something has a velocity
that I'll call v and you

00:02:31.328 --> 00:02:33.937
will call w,
and u is the speed

00:02:33.937 --> 00:02:36.310
relative to your frame and my
frame.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.360
All right, so this is the
notion of space-time because

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.044
space and time are getting mixed
up when you go to a new frame of

00:02:43.044 --> 00:02:45.655
reference.
But even in this world where

00:02:45.655 --> 00:02:48.621
nothing is sacred,
the following combination is

00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:51.587
very important,
which we denote as X dot

00:02:51.587 --> 00:02:54.658
X.
There's a new dot product now

00:02:54.658 --> 00:02:58.183
in space-time.
The new dot product will be the

00:02:58.183 --> 00:03:02.137
square of the time-like part
minus the square of the

00:03:02.137 --> 00:03:06.097
space-like part.
If you wanted to bring in all

00:03:06.097 --> 00:03:10.729
the components of space-time,
then you can modify it to

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:14.590
x_0^(2) - r dot
r.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.080
r dot r will be
x^(2) + y^(2) + z^(2).

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.495
So, you can use either notation.
Whenever possible I just keep

00:03:21.495 --> 00:03:23.900
two, but you've got to remember,
this is why it's a

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.205
four-dimensional dot product.
And this is the same for all

00:03:27.205 --> 00:03:28.689
people.
So, I can calculate it,

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:30.776
you can calculate it,
our x_0 and

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:32.310
x_1 will
differ,

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.889
but it's the property of the
Lorentz transformation,

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.872
that if I square this guy and
subtract it from the square of

00:03:37.872 --> 00:03:39.879
this guy,
on the right-hand side some

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.830
magical things will happen and
I'll get the same combination

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.387
without the primes.
That's like the length of the

00:03:45.387 --> 00:03:46.815
vector.
And that's called the

00:03:46.815 --> 00:03:52.007
space-time interval.
Let's call that s^(2),

00:03:52.007 --> 00:03:57.453
the space-time interval.
If it took two events separated

00:03:57.453 --> 00:04:01.039
in space by Δx and
separated in time by Δt,

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:04.167
then we like to use the symbol
Δs^(2) for the

00:04:04.167 --> 00:04:07.376
space-time interval.
That's the same thing applied

00:04:07.376 --> 00:04:11.410
to the differences rather than
to the coordinates themselves.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.746
And this is invariant.
Invariant is a term

00:04:14.746 --> 00:04:18.295
mathematicians use for saying
same for all people,

00:04:18.295 --> 00:04:21.410
or unaffected by Lorentz
transformation.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.276
It's the analogue of how far
you are from the origin in the

00:04:25.276 --> 00:04:27.610
old days, when I took two
frames,

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.942
one which is the standard
xy, the other is the

00:04:29.942 --> 00:04:32.459
rotated xy.
If you go to the rotated frame,

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:34.810
the components x and
y change,

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.956
but how far you are from the
origin, or what's the length of

00:04:37.956 --> 00:04:40.089
the vector is the same for all
people.

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:43.235
More generally,
the dot product of two vectors

00:04:43.235 --> 00:04:46.871
is invariant under rotations,
and this is the new dot

00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:49.287
product.
I use the symbol dot product,

00:04:49.287 --> 00:04:52.062
but I don't draw arrows,
because if I don't draw any

00:04:52.062 --> 00:04:55.490
arrows and use capital letters,
it means it's a four-vector.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.534
That's the X vector.
Then I said,

00:04:58.534 --> 00:05:03.570
"Let's try to reason by analogy
and try to invent a momentum

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.082
vector."
How did we invent the momentum

00:05:06.082 --> 00:05:09.710
vector in the old days?
We said, let the particle move

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.871
a distance Δr,
vector Δr,

00:05:12.871 --> 00:05:16.664
in a time Δt,
and a divide by Δt,

00:05:16.664 --> 00:05:20.090
and take some limit.
But I know this is a vector

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.829
because Δr is a
difference in two vectors.

00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:25.271
Where the particle is now,
and where it is later,

00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:28.374
the difference of two vectors
is also a tiny vector going from

00:05:28.374 --> 00:05:30.668
here to there.
Dividing by a scalar,

00:05:30.668 --> 00:05:34.015
by a scalar I mean something
that is not affected by

00:05:34.015 --> 00:05:37.822
rotations, means taking a vector
and multiplying it by some

00:05:37.822 --> 00:05:39.869
number.
Therefore, that's also a

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:42.965
vector, so this ratio is also a
vector, and the limit of the

00:05:42.965 --> 00:05:46.666
ratio is also a vector.
I'm sorry, I forgot the mass

00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:50.170
here, and we call it the
momentum vector.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.411
So, you can manufacture vectors
starting with a position vector

00:05:54.411 --> 00:05:58.242
by taking derivatives with
respect to something like time

00:05:58.242 --> 00:06:00.910
that is the same for all
observers,

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.616
where observers,
I meant in the old days,

00:06:03.616 --> 00:06:06.730
people with an axis rotated
anyway you like.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.827
I wanted the same thing now in
this present problem,

00:06:10.827 --> 00:06:15.006
but I now want to define
obviously a four-dimensional

00:06:15.006 --> 00:06:17.916
vector.
So, to do the four-dimensional

00:06:17.916 --> 00:06:21.699
vector, my plan is to define
something called momentum,

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.187
which is now going to be the
change in this fourth position

00:06:25.187 --> 00:06:27.731
divided by something.
The question is,

00:06:27.731 --> 00:06:33.670
"What do I divide it by?"
I cannot divide by Δt.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.199
In the old days Δt was
a sacred number,

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:38.417
same for all people.
Now Δt is like

00:06:38.417 --> 00:06:40.889
Δx or Δy,
it's one of the components,

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.261
and you don't divide the change
in the vector components by the

00:06:44.261 --> 00:06:47.089
change in one of the components
to get a velocity.

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:49.825
You've got to divide by
something that's going to play

00:06:49.825 --> 00:06:52.302
the role of time,
and have the same value for all

00:06:52.302 --> 00:06:54.680
people.
Well, we sort of know what that

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.382
quantity is.
Obviously, if a particle is

00:06:57.382 --> 00:07:00.690
moving from here to here in
space-time, this is

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.149
x_0 = ct and
this is x_1.

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:09.019
It moves the distance
Δx_1 in a time

00:07:09.019 --> 00:07:13.400
Δt, and we know that for
this piece of its motion the

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.669
following quantity,
Δs, which is [root of]

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:25.250
cΔt^(2) - Δx^(2),
is the same for all people.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.600
So, I should really be dividing
by this.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.065
Let me write it slightly
differently as cΔt times

00:07:37.065 --> 00:07:42.530
the square root of 1 minus
Δx over Δt^(2)

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:47.635
times 1/c^(2).
So, we are asked to divide by

00:07:47.635 --> 00:07:51.558
this crazy thing.
Well, let me write this crazy

00:07:51.558 --> 00:07:55.234
thing as c times
something I want to call

00:07:55.234 --> 00:08:00.292
dτ,
is dt times the square

00:08:00.292 --> 00:08:07.260
root of 1 minus Δx over
Δt^(2) times

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.910
1/c^(2).
Then I said,

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:14.779
"We can give a meaning to this
thing."

00:08:14.779 --> 00:08:18.229
In fact, let's take the
derivative with respect to

00:08:18.229 --> 00:08:21.480
τ not s.
They differ only by this factor

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.980
c, which is a constant so
it doesn't matter.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.174
τ has units of time,
and you can ask,

00:08:26.174 --> 00:08:27.870
"What does that time stand
for?"

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.237
It's not the time according to
me, but I argued that it's the

00:08:31.237 --> 00:08:34.590
time according to the particle.
Why?

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:38.330
Because you can evaluate this
quantity in any frame you like.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.320
So, go to the frame moving with
the particle.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.331
If you're moving with the
particle, and if you're here now

00:08:44.331 --> 00:08:46.498
and there later,
later is certainly later,

00:08:46.498 --> 00:08:48.769
but here remains here for the
particle.

00:08:48.769 --> 00:08:50.879
It doesn't move in its own
frame.

00:08:50.879 --> 00:08:54.543
So, Δx will vanish,
therefore Δs simply

00:08:54.543 --> 00:08:58.478
reduces to c times the
time elapsed according to the

00:08:58.478 --> 00:09:01.355
particle.
So, dτ is the time

00:09:01.355 --> 00:09:04.580
elapsed according to the
particle itself.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.687
According to the particle.
That's what we're going to

00:09:12.687 --> 00:09:15.017
divide by.
So, it's a very clever way to

00:09:15.017 --> 00:09:18.510
circumvent the question of what
should I take the derivative

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.118
respect to,
my time and your time all are

00:09:21.118 --> 00:09:24.373
variable, we don't agree on it.
But let's ask how much time

00:09:24.373 --> 00:09:26.769
elapsed according to the one
thing we are studying,

00:09:26.769 --> 00:09:29.739
and let's divide by that time.
That answer will be the same

00:09:29.739 --> 00:09:32.766
because you and I may not agree
on how long it took to go from

00:09:32.766 --> 00:09:34.974
here to there,
but we can all ask how long did

00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:37.220
the particle say it took to go
from here to there.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.828
We're talking about the same
thing, and we'll get the same

00:09:39.828 --> 00:09:42.157
answer.
To get the particle time you've

00:09:42.157 --> 00:09:45.992
got to take the time according
to you and me and multiply it by

00:09:45.992 --> 00:09:47.674
this factor.
This factor,

00:09:47.674 --> 00:09:50.820
by the way, is nothing but
usual time dilatation.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:57.856
Because the particle says it
took time dτ because the

00:09:57.856 --> 00:10:01.437
clock has slowed exactly this
amount, I will say it took

00:10:01.437 --> 00:10:04.839
longer by this amount.
So, let's rewrite this in a way

00:10:04.839 --> 00:10:06.990
that's going to be more helpful
to us.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:11.819
Take the ratio and write
dt over dτ is 1

00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:16.559
over the square root of 1 minus
v^(2)/c^(2).

00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:18.649
I'm going to use that in a
minute.

00:10:18.649 --> 00:10:22.199
That just says the time
according to me and the time

00:10:22.199 --> 00:10:26.304
according to the particle are
related by the time dilatation

00:10:26.304 --> 00:10:30.549
factor that's controlled by the
velocity of the particle.

00:10:30.549 --> 00:10:33.830
Now, we are ready to define the
four-momentum p.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:38.846
The four-momentum p is
going to be m times

00:10:38.846 --> 00:10:44.409
dx_0/dτ times
mdx_1/dτ.

00:10:44.409 --> 00:10:46.510
I'm not going to bother with
the other components.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:47.450
You can always put them back.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:54.840
But x_0 you
remember was ct.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.695
So, this really becomes
mdt divided by

00:10:59.695 --> 00:11:04.550
dτ, mdx divided
dτ.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:11.409
This is guaranteed to be a
four-vector.

00:11:11.409 --> 00:11:14.762
That means, if you know the
components of this in one frame

00:11:14.762 --> 00:11:17.074
of reference,
and you call one of them as

00:11:17.074 --> 00:11:20.862
p_0,
and you call this one as

00:11:20.862 --> 00:11:24.907
p_1.
Then, in a frame that's moving

00:11:24.907 --> 00:11:27.690
relative to your x speed
u, our

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.485
p_0 prime will
be p_0 minus

00:11:31.485 --> 00:11:34.268
β times
p_1 over the

00:11:34.268 --> 00:11:36.999
square root,
and p_1 prime

00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:39.496
will be p_1
minus β times

00:11:39.496 --> 00:11:41.789
p_0 over the
square root.

00:11:41.789 --> 00:11:44.010
It will transform just the
components of x.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.675
Yes?
Student:

00:11:45.675 --> 00:11:49.440
For p_0,
where does the c go?

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.476
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Where did the

00:11:51.476 --> 00:11:52.666
c go?
No, it did not go,

00:11:52.666 --> 00:11:54.251
you're quite right.
The c,

00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:58.220
x_0 the
ct, you're quite right.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.800
It is c times dt.
You need that;

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.930
then, this is correct.
So, we've got a four-vector,

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.029
but we don't know what it
means.

00:12:08.029 --> 00:12:11.250
Because we don't know what
dτ means.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.953
Of course it's the time
according to the particle,

00:12:13.953 --> 00:12:16.049
but I don't care about the
particle.

00:12:16.049 --> 00:12:18.402
I'm studying this particle,
I've got my own clock,

00:12:18.402 --> 00:12:21.090
I've got my own meter sticks,
I want to think in terms of

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.270
time according to me.
Period.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:26.723
Well, we can do that.
We can do that by going to

00:12:26.723 --> 00:12:29.641
anything where you take a
derivative such as

00:12:29.641 --> 00:12:32.897
dx_1/dτ and
you can write is as

00:12:32.897 --> 00:12:36.289
dx_1/dt times
dt/dτ.

00:12:36.289 --> 00:12:39.037
dx_1dt is
something we understand,

00:12:39.037 --> 00:12:41.730
it's just the velocity
according to you and me.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:45.753
If you use that rule here,
you will find the momentum has

00:12:45.753 --> 00:12:48.700
got components m times
c,

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:53.569
dt/dτ is dt/dt,
which is 1, times dt

00:12:53.569 --> 00:12:56.850
divided by dτ,
which is this factor here.

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:04.448
And the second thing will be
mv divided by the same

00:13:04.448 --> 00:13:06.123
thing.
In other words,

00:13:06.123 --> 00:13:09.363
you can trade τ
derivatives for t

00:13:09.363 --> 00:13:12.602
derivatives everywhere,
provided you attach this

00:13:12.602 --> 00:13:14.417
factor.
That's the ratio of the

00:13:14.417 --> 00:13:16.520
τ derivative to the
t derivative.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.324
So, now I have a four-vector.
I still don't know what it

00:13:20.324 --> 00:13:23.284
means, but at least it is
written in terms of things with

00:13:23.284 --> 00:13:25.610
a direct operational
significance for me.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.857
I see a particle moving,
it's got a velocity,

00:13:28.857 --> 00:13:31.440
put that in and I get this
thing.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:35.119
Apparently, the relativity
theory says this should play the

00:13:35.119 --> 00:13:38.164
role of momentum,
but a four dimensional momentum

00:13:38.164 --> 00:13:40.957
in your new world.
If you want to bring the other

00:13:40.957 --> 00:13:43.800
components, we'll put an arrow,
you can keep it or leave it;

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.350
it doesn't matter.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.920
Now, notice once again
that--Okay, I'll continue some

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.733
more.
I've already done this last

00:13:55.733 --> 00:13:58.837
time, but let me remind you.
We looked at this guy and said,

00:13:58.837 --> 00:14:02.164
"Look, at smaller velocities,
when v/c is very small,

00:14:02.164 --> 00:14:05.470
the denominator is just 1.
Numerator is mv.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.409
And then I said,
"Uh-huh, that's the momentum."

00:14:07.409 --> 00:14:10.223
So, it must be that with all
these factors,

00:14:10.223 --> 00:14:13.840
this is the momentum in the new
relativistic theory.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.449
In the new relativistic theory
momentum is not just mass times

00:14:17.449 --> 00:14:19.717
velocity.
Mass times velocity divided by

00:14:19.717 --> 00:14:21.372
all this stuff.
The theory says,

00:14:21.372 --> 00:14:26.019
"Use that as your momentum."
That's good.

00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:27.919
Then, we say,
"Okay, that's my momentum,

00:14:27.919 --> 00:14:31.312
who is this?"
I expanded this out for small

00:14:31.312 --> 00:14:34.052
velocity.
If you put velocity equal to 0,

00:14:34.052 --> 00:14:36.548
you get mc.
That looks like just the mass

00:14:36.548 --> 00:14:38.639
and we don't know what that
corresponds to.

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:41.470
It's the mass,
nothing kinematical.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:45.314
But if you expand the square
root a little further out to one

00:14:45.314 --> 00:14:48.070
more term, we found that the 0
component,

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.919
p_0,
looks like mc times 1

00:14:51.919 --> 00:14:56.320
plus v^(2) over
2c^(2) plus dot dot dot.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:01.410
That becomes mc +
1/2mv^(2) times 1 over

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:05.320
c plus dot dot dot.
And now I finally have

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.092
something I understand,
because ½ mv^(2) is

00:15:08.092 --> 00:15:11.610
familiar kinetic energy.
But I don't like this annoying

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:14.962
c here.
If I multiply both sides by

00:15:14.962 --> 00:15:20.166
c, I learn that c
times p_0 is

00:15:20.166 --> 00:15:23.549
mc^(2) plus ½
mv^(2),

00:15:23.549 --> 00:15:27.300
plus more stuff that's more and
more powers of v over

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.820
c.
But this I argue.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.565
If that's the kinetic energy,
everything is an energy

00:15:32.565 --> 00:15:35.100
formula, so the whole thing
stands for energy.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:43.030
So, I learned that the first
component, of P is energy

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:46.715
divided by c.
So, I come back here and I

00:15:46.715 --> 00:15:48.680
write this as E/c.

00:15:55.399 --> 00:15:58.494
So, for all of you,
or for many of you who found

00:15:58.494 --> 00:16:01.392
some of this mathematics
difficult to follow,

00:16:01.392 --> 00:16:03.928
it depends.
For me it was love at first

00:16:03.928 --> 00:16:05.646
sight.
This is really when I said,

00:16:05.646 --> 00:16:08.925
"I want to go into business."
For some reason this worked for

00:16:08.925 --> 00:16:10.279
me.
But it doesn't matter.

00:16:10.279 --> 00:16:13.100
What you have to know is what
I'm going to tell you now.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.149
Operationally,
I'm not going to hold you

00:16:15.149 --> 00:16:17.830
responsible for this part of the
material at all.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:21.411
For me, it's part of explaining
how logically starting with the

00:16:21.411 --> 00:16:24.183
very first axiom--first two
axioms you can deduce

00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:26.308
everything.
But now, I want to tell you

00:16:26.308 --> 00:16:28.639
operationally what you guys are
supposed to know.

00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:31.509
You are supposed to learn the
following two things.

00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:34.509
In the old days,
we had time and we had space;

00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:37.149
they have been united into a
single quantity;

00:16:37.149 --> 00:16:40.074
(ct,r),
which we write as

00:16:40.074 --> 00:16:45.169
x_0,
x_1 etcetera.

00:16:45.169 --> 00:16:47.558
In other words,
the three components of a

00:16:47.558 --> 00:16:50.903
vector joined with one quantity
that looked like a scalar

00:16:50.903 --> 00:16:53.710
together to form a
four-dimensional object.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:57.706
Now, we are learning that there
is another four-dimensional

00:16:57.706 --> 00:17:01.703
object, one of which is just the
momentum, and the other is

00:17:01.703 --> 00:17:06.033
energy divided by c.
And we want to call that as

00:17:06.033 --> 00:17:10.339
p_0,
p_1 etcetera.

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:12.961
Again, the familiar momentum,
which is a vector,

00:17:12.961 --> 00:17:16.379
joined with another quantity,
which the best way to think

00:17:16.379 --> 00:17:19.132
about it is kinetic energy,
plus rest energy,

00:17:19.132 --> 00:17:22.180
plus other corrections.
But it's a scalar;

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.065
it doesn't depend on
orientation of axis in the old

00:17:25.065 --> 00:17:26.542
days.
But now under Lorentz

00:17:26.542 --> 00:17:28.738
transformation,
namely, when you go from one

00:17:28.738 --> 00:17:31.176
frame to another,
E and p will all

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:33.962
mix with each other just like
x and t will mix

00:17:33.962 --> 00:17:36.450
with each other,
but this is the new four-vector.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.690
It's called the energy-momentum
four-vector.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:42.160
Just like that's called the
space-time four-vector.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.720
This is the energy-momentum
four-vector.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.407
So, all over relativity you
will find three objects,

00:17:47.407 --> 00:17:50.306
which used to be part of a
vector, will combine with the

00:17:50.306 --> 00:17:52.519
fourth one, which used to be a
scalar;

00:17:52.519 --> 00:17:57.410
together, they'll form a new
four-dimensional vector.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.259
So, we should know the
following.

00:17:59.259 --> 00:18:03.180
When we are studying particle
dynamics, we have to know in

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.620
more detail--in fact,
let me dedicate a whole board

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:11.566
to that, it's very important.
The new definition is that it's

00:18:11.566 --> 00:18:14.760
E over c and
p.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.780
Yes?
Student:

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:20.046
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:18:20.046 --> 00:18:23.137
Shankar: Well,
it looks like mc^(2)

00:18:23.137 --> 00:18:26.160
plus ½ mv^(2) plus other
stuff,

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.280
right?
So, I recognize ½

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.645
mv^(2) as an energy;
then, the other powers

00:18:31.645 --> 00:18:34.177
v^(4)/c^(4),
they're all corrections

00:18:34.177 --> 00:18:36.950
obviously to the energy at
higher velocity.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:40.510
Just like momentum,
even in relativistic theory was

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.906
not mv.
It started out like mv,

00:18:42.906 --> 00:18:44.959
but when you expand the
denominators and powers to

00:18:44.959 --> 00:18:46.970
v/c you get more and more
corrections.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:50.919
I identify this as an energy
because if I go to very low

00:18:50.919 --> 00:18:53.720
velocities, it reduces the rest
mass,

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.999
which is never going to change,
plus a ½ mv^(2),

00:18:55.999 --> 00:18:57.740
which played the role of
kinetic energy.

00:19:01.319 --> 00:19:04.171
That's why it has units of
energy, and one term in it looks

00:19:04.171 --> 00:19:05.743
like energy.
So, the whole thing,

00:19:05.743 --> 00:19:08.260
the theory is telling you,
it's all just the energy of the

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.072
particle.
In the old days when velocities

00:19:11.072 --> 00:19:14.459
were very small,
we saw only that two terms are

00:19:14.459 --> 00:19:17.920
written: ½ mv^(2) and
mc^(2).

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.155
mc^(2) we didn't bother
with because it doesn't change

00:19:21.155 --> 00:19:23.285
in any collision.
You add the mc^(2)

00:19:23.285 --> 00:19:25.982
before, each particle has got
its own mc^(2) before and

00:19:25.982 --> 00:19:27.750
after;
they simply cancel.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.659
So, the ½ mv squares
before and after that would

00:19:30.659 --> 00:19:33.039
equal, and we use that to solve
collisions.

00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:37.206
Now we will be told you should
use the conservation of this

00:19:37.206 --> 00:19:41.660
energy and the conservation of
this momentum in a collision.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.731
Okay, so the first thing is
this is E and this is

00:19:44.731 --> 00:19:47.579
p, and if anyone says,
"What is E?"

00:19:47.579 --> 00:19:52.740
It is mc^(2) divided by
1 minus v^(2)/c^(2),

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:56.687
and p in one dimension
is mv divided by 1 minus

00:19:56.687 --> 00:19:58.530
v^(2)/c^(2).

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.055
This you must know.
So, momentum and relativity

00:20:06.055 --> 00:20:08.769
looks a bit like the old
momentum but it's got this

00:20:08.769 --> 00:20:11.789
ubiquitous factor.
And energy looks really weird;

00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:14.509
doesn't look like anything on
Earth, but if you expand this in

00:20:14.509 --> 00:20:16.738
powers of v,
you will see the terms we wrote

00:20:16.738 --> 00:20:18.713
down.
Rest energy plus everything

00:20:18.713 --> 00:20:21.977
else you can call energy of
motion, and the first term of

00:20:21.977 --> 00:20:25.299
the energy of motion is the
familiar ½ mv^(2).

00:20:25.299 --> 00:20:28.046
In other words,
this is how the world always

00:20:28.046 --> 00:20:30.726
was.
It was revealed to us in the

00:20:30.726 --> 00:20:35.156
old days when we only looked at
low energy particles as

00:20:35.156 --> 00:20:38.109
mc^(2) + ½
mv^(2).

00:20:38.109 --> 00:20:41.396
And we couldn't see the dot dot
dot terms because v/c was

00:20:41.396 --> 00:20:44.578
so small, the fourth power and
sixth power and eighth power of

00:20:44.578 --> 00:20:47.029
v/c were too small for us
to detect.

00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:51.359
Likewise, the momentum of a
particle was never mv;

00:20:51.359 --> 00:20:53.279
it was mv divided by all
this.

00:20:53.279 --> 00:20:55.303
But for small values the
v/c looked like that,

00:20:55.303 --> 00:20:57.016
and they thought,
"Hey, that's what is really

00:20:57.016 --> 00:20:59.041
happening."
So, we were looking at an

00:20:59.041 --> 00:21:02.098
approximation to these
quantities in the old days when

00:21:02.098 --> 00:21:05.334
velocities were small,
and as velocities go up,

00:21:05.334 --> 00:21:09.746
those quantities aren't useful,
this is what the theory says

00:21:09.746 --> 00:21:13.410
should play the role of the new
four-momentum.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:16.913
So, the significance of this
being the forward momentum,

00:21:16.913 --> 00:21:20.990
first of all is what is written
in the top right corner there;

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:24.098
namely, if you know the energy
and momentum in one frame,

00:21:24.098 --> 00:21:27.151
you can find the energy and
momentum in another frame of

00:21:27.151 --> 00:21:29.856
reference moving relative to me.
For that purpose,

00:21:29.856 --> 00:21:31.892
you should take the energy and
divide by c,

00:21:31.892 --> 00:21:33.680
you should call it
p_0,

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.630
the momentum can be left as it
is, and this will behave like

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.720
x_0,
that will behave like

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.049
x_1,
under Lorentz transformation.

00:21:41.049 --> 00:21:44.624
But there are other
consequences of the fact that

00:21:44.624 --> 00:21:49.065
P is a four-vector.
The first consequence it this:

00:21:49.065 --> 00:21:54.011
you remember the dot product of
a vector with itself is the same

00:21:54.011 --> 00:21:57.820
for all observers.
So, what's the dot product of

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.050
P with itself?
Well, before I do that,

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:04.923
let me remind you in general,
in relativity you will have

00:22:04.923 --> 00:22:07.827
four-vectors:
(A) you'll have one part that

00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:11.023
looks like time,
and one part that looks like an

00:22:11.023 --> 00:22:13.423
ordinary vector.
And (B), is another

00:22:13.423 --> 00:22:17.982
four-vector, it's got a part
that looks time and another part

00:22:17.982 --> 00:22:20.869
that looks like an ordinary
vector.

00:22:20.869 --> 00:22:24.380
It's a union up of former
vector with a former scalar.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:28.241
And they will transform under
Lorentz transformation just like

00:22:28.241 --> 00:22:30.519
x_0 and
t.

00:22:30.519 --> 00:22:33.361
But the following quantity
A dot B,

00:22:33.361 --> 00:22:36.438
which is A_0
B_0 minus the

00:22:36.438 --> 00:22:39.280
usual dot product of the spatial
components,

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.867
is invariant.
That means all people will

00:22:42.867 --> 00:22:44.480
agree on this quantity.

00:22:49.329 --> 00:22:52.838
And a special case is A
dot A,

00:22:52.838 --> 00:22:56.265
which equals
A_0^(2) minus

00:22:56.265 --> 00:23:01.103
the length of the vector part,
which for our purpose will be

00:23:01.103 --> 00:23:05.230
just A_0^(2) -
A_1^(2).

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.900
This is all reasoning by
analogy.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:12.468
Yes?
Student:

00:23:12.468 --> 00:23:14.906
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:23:14.906 --> 00:23:17.815
Shankar: No.
Quaternion are a slightly

00:23:17.815 --> 00:23:21.007
different object.
You can form with these four

00:23:21.007 --> 00:23:24.770
numbers something that you may
call a quaternion.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.550
Right.
They were invented before

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.807
relativity by Hamilton,
and they are of great

00:23:30.807 --> 00:23:34.152
mathematical beauty.
They're a generalization of

00:23:34.152 --> 00:23:37.474
numbers.
You know, we generalize real

00:23:37.474 --> 00:23:41.704
numbers to complex numbers;
then, we went from complex

00:23:41.704 --> 00:23:43.830
numbers to things called
quaternions.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.817
They are also numbers;
you can multiply them by each

00:23:46.817 --> 00:23:50.212
other, but the product AB
differs from the product

00:23:50.212 --> 00:23:53.179
BA.
They're called hyper-complex

00:23:53.179 --> 00:23:57.850
numbers where the order in which
you multiply them matters.

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:01.471
Okay.
So, now let's ask what is the

00:24:01.471 --> 00:24:06.691
invariant length square of the
momentum four-vector with

00:24:06.691 --> 00:24:10.065
itself.
That means, you've got to do

00:24:10.065 --> 00:24:13.009
p_0^(2) -
p^(2).

00:24:13.009 --> 00:24:17.616
That means you are trying to
take m_0--I'm

00:24:17.616 --> 00:24:21.826
sorry, you're going to take
mc over this factor

00:24:21.826 --> 00:24:25.256
square,
minus mv over this

00:24:25.256 --> 00:24:29.045
factor square.
Well, let's try to do this in

00:24:29.045 --> 00:24:31.486
our head, guys.
m^(2) is going to come

00:24:31.486 --> 00:24:32.930
out of the whole thing,
you agree?

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:36.287
On the top, I have got 1 over 1
minus v^(2) over

00:24:36.287 --> 00:24:38.615
c^(2),
yet I have minus v^(2)

00:24:38.615 --> 00:24:40.779
over 1 minus v^(2) over
c^(2),

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:44.040
so they will all cancel giving
you mc^(2).

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:49.988
Uh, m^(2)c^(2).
[Note: Here,

00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:51.132
the Professor has started
dropping the subscript on

00:24:51.132 --> 00:24:53.322
m_0,].
So, the four-vector of any

00:24:53.322 --> 00:24:56.952
particle has a length that does
not at all depend on how fast

00:24:56.952 --> 00:24:58.790
it's moving.
It depends only on this.

00:25:03.779 --> 00:25:06.714
When you take a velocity vector
for a particle,

00:25:06.714 --> 00:25:10.067
it doesn't have a fixed length.
The particle can be moving

00:25:10.067 --> 00:25:12.673
slow, it can be moving fast.
So v_x^(2) +

00:25:12.673 --> 00:25:15.587
v_y^(2) could be
whatever you like depending on

00:25:15.587 --> 00:25:18.328
how it's moving.
But this relativistic length

00:25:18.328 --> 00:25:22.029
square of a four-vector is
independent of velocity because

00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:25.925
the velocity here when combined
with this number just cancels

00:25:25.925 --> 00:25:28.680
out.
Well, that's just the way it is.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.891
Now, if you're not good in
algebra, there's a shortcut for

00:25:32.891 --> 00:25:34.985
finding this.
Let me tell you what the

00:25:34.985 --> 00:25:37.368
shortcut is, and we love the
shortcuts because they're very

00:25:37.368 --> 00:25:39.702
helpful.
And the moral of the story is

00:25:39.702 --> 00:25:41.910
also illustrated by the
shortcut.

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:43.849
I want to find P dot
P.

00:25:43.849 --> 00:25:46.920
It's an invariant because it's
like a dot product,

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.213
so anybody can calculate it.
How about somebody riding with

00:25:51.213 --> 00:25:54.156
the particle?
If you're riding with the

00:25:54.156 --> 00:25:57.788
particle your 0 component is
m_0c,

00:25:57.788 --> 00:26:00.840
is mc,
there is no velocity for you,

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.877
and you have no momentum.
As the particle has no momentum

00:26:04.877 --> 00:26:08.112
as seen by the particle so the
components of the vector

00:26:08.112 --> 00:26:11.627
P become mc and 0.
What's the length square of

00:26:11.627 --> 00:26:13.701
this vector?
Well, it's the square of this

00:26:13.701 --> 00:26:15.913
guy and case closed;
there's nothing here to

00:26:15.913 --> 00:26:18.896
subtract from here.
That's a quick way to verify

00:26:18.896 --> 00:26:22.217
that this length of vector with
itself is in fact

00:26:22.217 --> 00:26:24.447
m^(2)c^(2).
In other words,

00:26:24.447 --> 00:26:27.141
the trick is ride with the
particle and calculate the

00:26:27.141 --> 00:26:29.390
vector.
Then, the vector has only one

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:32.596
component, namely mc.
It doesn't have a spatial part

00:26:32.596 --> 00:26:34.809
because it's not moving
according to itself.

00:26:34.809 --> 00:26:38.619
That's where P dot
P is m^(2)c^(2).

00:26:38.619 --> 00:26:41.743
So, people write it also as
follows: remember

00:26:41.743 --> 00:26:45.009
p_0 was
E over c,

00:26:45.009 --> 00:26:50.410
 this is just P^(2)
is m^(2)c^(2).

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:54.522
This is one way to write it
explicitly, but here is how

00:26:54.522 --> 00:26:57.416
people write it:
multiply both sides by

00:26:57.416 --> 00:27:00.919
c^(2) and write
E^(2) is equal to

00:27:00.919 --> 00:27:04.270
c^(2)p^(2) -
m^(2)c^(4);

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:07.440
that deserves a box.
That's how we remember it.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:11.049
I have just rearranged this
equation.

00:27:11.049 --> 00:27:13.539
P dot P is
m^(2)c^(2).

00:27:13.539 --> 00:27:16.162
By definition P dot
P is the time-like

00:27:16.162 --> 00:27:18.940
component square minus the
spatial component square.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.170
We agree the time-like part is
E/c;

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:22.859
the spatial part is just the
momentum.

00:27:22.859 --> 00:27:25.259
So, I've just rearranged it to
get this.

00:27:25.259 --> 00:27:29.116
And it says the energy of the
particle depends on its

00:27:29.116 --> 00:27:33.418
momentum, if it comes complete
to rest, you kill this term,

00:27:33.418 --> 00:27:36.460
that's E = mc^(2);
that's the rest energy of a

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:36.790
particle.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:46.000
Now, I am almost finished with
the kinematics except for one

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.553
thing.
There are strange particles in

00:27:48.553 --> 00:27:53.670
the world called photons.
A photon has no rest mass;

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:56.624
therefore, if you naively went
by any of these formulas,

00:27:56.624 --> 00:27:58.720
if you killed the mass of the
photon,

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.849
you might think energy and
momentum vanish because m

00:28:01.849 --> 00:28:03.792
is going to 0,
but we all know enough

00:28:03.792 --> 00:28:06.490
mathematics to know that if it's
0 on the top,

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:09.150
you could beat it if there's a
0 in the bottom.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:12.140
That will occur only for v =
c.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:15.925
So, particles moving at the
speed of light do have energy

00:28:15.925 --> 00:28:18.900
and momentum,
but they don't come from a mass

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:22.028
divided by something,
or mass times velocity divided

00:28:22.028 --> 00:28:24.083
by something.
They simply have energy and

00:28:24.083 --> 00:28:26.901
momentum that obeys this
equation without an m on

00:28:26.901 --> 00:28:29.508
the right-hand side.
For a photon,

00:28:29.508 --> 00:28:36.101
E^(2) equal to (c
times p)^(2) is what a

00:28:36.101 --> 00:28:39.716
photon obeys.
So, photons can have energy,

00:28:39.716 --> 00:28:43.295
and photons can have momentum,
but their energy will be

00:28:43.295 --> 00:28:47.405
c times their momentum so
that if you find the invariant

00:28:47.405 --> 00:28:50.720
square of the photon momentum
you will get 0.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.299
So, photons are particles whose
momentum square is 0.

00:28:54.299 --> 00:28:57.756
But the square is the
four-dimensional square with the

00:28:57.756 --> 00:29:00.300
time square minus the spatial
square.

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:12.364
So, let me summarize once more
for people who may not want to

00:29:12.364 --> 00:29:16.073
follow every detail.
The practical part of what you

00:29:16.073 --> 00:29:19.359
must understand from what I've
been teaching you is that when

00:29:19.359 --> 00:29:21.549
you study a single material
particle,

00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:24.105
which has a mass,
so that it can be brought to

00:29:24.105 --> 00:29:26.150
rest and made to sit on the
table,

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.990
we associate with that at
four-vector.

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:32.230
The first part of that is the
energy over c;

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.657
the second part of that is
called the momentum,

00:29:34.657 --> 00:29:37.930
and the explicit formula for
these are m_0,

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:43.500
or mc divided by this
and mv divided by this.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:48.653
And one can explicitly verify
that P dot P is

00:29:48.653 --> 00:29:52.619
m^(2)c^(2).
This is a summary of all that

00:29:52.619 --> 00:29:54.648
I've said.
If you don't know anything at

00:29:54.648 --> 00:29:55.310
all, know this.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:02.417
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:30:02.417 --> 00:30:06.150
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes.

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:10.261
A capital P without any
arrows on it is supposed to be a

00:30:10.261 --> 00:30:12.875
four-vector,
and the dot product of it is

00:30:12.875 --> 00:30:16.486
defined as the square of the
first component minus the square

00:30:16.486 --> 00:30:19.319
of the second one.
That is correct.

00:30:19.319 --> 00:30:22.558
And for photons,
we always like to use the

00:30:22.558 --> 00:30:26.903
symbol K for the momentum
of a photon rather than

00:30:26.903 --> 00:30:29.880
P.
Luckily, people agreed more or

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.740
less by convention,
photon momentum is called

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:35.090
K,
and it's called Q by

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:37.299
some people, but we call it
K.

00:30:37.299 --> 00:30:40.733
And the energy of the photon is
when we call ,

00:30:40.733 --> 00:30:44.480
the momentum of the photon is
going to be called k.

00:30:50.349 --> 00:30:55.809
And the condition is  =
kc.

00:30:55.809 --> 00:30:59.880
And there's' the condition
K dot K = 0.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.405
K^(2) if you like,
shorthand for K dot

00:31:03.405 --> 00:31:06.859
K, is 0 for photons.
A photon is a particle whose

00:31:06.859 --> 00:31:08.619
square of the four-momentum is
0.

00:31:08.619 --> 00:31:12.238
Material particles that can
come to rest have a square of

00:31:12.238 --> 00:31:15.470
the fourth momentum,
which is m^(2)c^(2).

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:18.549
This is something you have to
know.

00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:21.147
Another thing you have to know
is that when I write them in

00:31:21.147 --> 00:31:23.815
this notation as four-vectors,
you should know the following:

00:31:23.815 --> 00:31:25.916
if you know the components,
p_0 and

00:31:25.916 --> 00:31:27.440
p_1 in one
frame,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.952
and you move relative to
S with speed u,

00:31:29.952 --> 00:31:32.844
p_0 prime and
p_1 prime will

00:31:32.844 --> 00:31:34.597
be related to
p_0 and

00:31:34.597 --> 00:31:37.299
p_1 by the
Lorentz transformation.

00:31:37.299 --> 00:31:40.155
Just like x_0
prime and x_1

00:31:40.155 --> 00:31:42.248
prime are related to
x_1 and

00:31:42.248 --> 00:31:44.390
x by that formula on the
top left.

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:49.509
I'm going to do a lot of
problems for you so you get used

00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:52.710
to doing relativistic
kinematics.

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:56.340
Last thing I want to tell you
is why do we take this

00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:00.133
definition of momentum.
Okay, you agree with the theory

00:32:00.133 --> 00:32:03.705
naturally gave out something
that it said deserves to be

00:32:03.705 --> 00:32:07.049
called momentum.
But what's so nice about this?

00:32:07.049 --> 00:32:10.990
Why is it important that the
momentum-energy form a vector?

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:14.989
I'm going to give you a reason
for it, and try to follow the

00:32:14.989 --> 00:32:17.267
reason.
The whole advantage of energy

00:32:17.267 --> 00:32:20.717
and momentum--What is the big
deal about energy and momentum,

00:32:20.717 --> 00:32:23.170
let me ask you that.
Yes?

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:23.790
Student:
[inaudible]

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:25.150
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: They are conserved.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.192
They were not useful unless the
special utility came from the

00:32:28.192 --> 00:32:31.413
fact they're conserved.
So, you can put a restriction

00:32:31.413 --> 00:32:34.375
on possible collisions.
You add the momentum before,

00:32:34.375 --> 00:32:36.250
it's got to agree with momentum
after.

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:38.469
You add the energy before,
it's got to agree with the

00:32:38.469 --> 00:32:40.660
energy after.
Of course, in relativity,

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:44.133
energy and momentum have been
assembled into four-vector,

00:32:44.133 --> 00:32:48.039
so conservation of momentum
will mean really four equations.

00:32:48.039 --> 00:32:50.128
The zero part will be the
energy before,

00:32:50.128 --> 00:32:52.913
will be the energy after,
and the three special parts

00:32:52.913 --> 00:32:55.269
will be x component and
momentum.

00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:57.869
Before will be x
component after and so on.

00:32:57.869 --> 00:33:01.300
That's all very good,
but you've got to make sure

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:05.303
that if a momentum is conserved
for me, forward momentum,

00:33:05.303 --> 00:33:08.019
it must also be conserved for
you.

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:11.445
There's no use having a
quantity that's conserved for me

00:33:11.445 --> 00:33:14.196
and not conserved for you.
So, by the time you bring up

00:33:14.196 --> 00:33:15.813
something and say,
"We're going to use it as a

00:33:15.813 --> 00:33:18.311
conserved quantity,"
you've got to make sure the

00:33:18.311 --> 00:33:21.470
conservational law is not
limited to one observer.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:23.750
And that's what I want to show
you.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:27.297
I want to argue without writing
any questions that if energy and

00:33:27.297 --> 00:33:30.466
momentum are conserved for me,
they are going to be conserved

00:33:30.466 --> 00:33:32.060
for you, because they are
vectors.

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:35.340
Let's understand why.
Suppose you've got a collision;

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.706
a lot of particles come in;
one particle brings

00:33:37.706 --> 00:33:39.234
momentum-energy
P_1,

00:33:39.234 --> 00:33:41.950
other one brings in energy and
momentum P_2.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:46.588
And at the end of the collision
maybe they become particle 3 and

00:33:46.588 --> 00:33:50.150
particle 4 and particle 5.
In relativistic theories,

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:53.150
if two particles come in,
you can have 36 particles

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:56.171
coming out.
In fact, that's why they built

00:33:56.171 --> 00:33:58.390
accelerators.
If two went in and two came

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:01.105
out, it's a waste of time.
You can smash any two things

00:34:01.105 --> 00:34:03.539
and with that energy you can
produce matter.

00:34:03.539 --> 00:34:05.589
So, it's not a mistake I've
made.

00:34:05.589 --> 00:34:07.940
I do mean that sometimes two
can go into three,

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.368
or four or five.
Let's take an example where

00:34:10.368 --> 00:34:12.300
this is true.
Each P is a

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:17.138
four-component object like this.
Suppose I say incoming equals

00:34:17.138 --> 00:34:19.883
outgoing.
Now, if you see the whole

00:34:19.883 --> 00:34:24.140
collision from your frame of
reference, then I maintain that

00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:27.099
the numbers you get,
P_1 prime and

00:34:27.099 --> 00:34:28.918
P_2 prime,
will also equal

00:34:28.918 --> 00:34:31.603
P_3 prime plus
P_4 prime plus

00:34:31.603 --> 00:34:33.815
P_5 prime.
That's guaranteed,

00:34:33.815 --> 00:34:36.781
and I want to tell you why.
Suppose these were ordinary

00:34:36.781 --> 00:34:39.895
vectors, and let me make life
simple by saying that

00:34:39.895 --> 00:34:42.510
P_1 +
P_2 became

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.130
P_3.

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:51.217
What that means is one vector,
P_1,

00:34:51.217 --> 00:34:52.959
another vector,
P_2,

00:34:52.959 --> 00:34:55.329
added up to one vector,
P_3.

00:34:55.329 --> 00:34:58.429
Except these are not ordinary
arrows, these are arrows in four

00:34:58.429 --> 00:35:01.388
dimensions.
The fact that two arrows add up

00:35:01.388 --> 00:35:04.355
to a third one,
are equal to a third one,

00:35:04.355 --> 00:35:07.803
means they form a triangle.
Now, if they can form a

00:35:07.803 --> 00:35:10.250
triangle for me,
and you can stand on your head

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:12.750
and do what you like,
it will still be true.

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:15.868
Even though it looks like this,
it is still true that this guy

00:35:15.868 --> 00:35:17.760
plus this guy is equal to that
guy.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:21.070
If two vectors add up to a
third one;

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:24.809
namely, if a sum of two vectors
is equal to another vector;

00:35:24.809 --> 00:35:27.566
namely, the left-hand side
vector is equal to the

00:35:27.566 --> 00:35:30.552
right-hand side vector,
going to a rotated frame will

00:35:30.552 --> 00:35:34.113
continue to say that the rotated
vector is equal to the rotated

00:35:34.113 --> 00:35:36.986
vector.
That's because equal vectors

00:35:36.986 --> 00:35:40.100
upon rotation will remain equal
vectors.

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:43.762
That's the whole point.
The total incoming momentum

00:35:43.762 --> 00:35:47.327
four-vector, call it P
incoming, and this is the

00:35:47.327 --> 00:35:50.760
outgoing momentum,
call it the P outgoing.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:54.833
If P incoming is equal
to P outgoing for me,

00:35:54.833 --> 00:35:58.763
so two vectors that equal in
space-time, for the rotated

00:35:58.763 --> 00:36:02.650
observer they will be equal.
Do you understand why?

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:05.598
Because my total incoming
vector will undergo Lorentz

00:36:05.598 --> 00:36:08.320
transformation to become your
incoming vector.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.148
My outgoing vector will undergo
Lorentz transformation to find

00:36:11.148 --> 00:36:13.542
your outgoing.
But if the input of the Lorentz

00:36:13.542 --> 00:36:16.420
transformation is the same,
the output will also be the

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:19.830
same because you will be putting
the very same numbers to get out

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:23.171
the output numbers.
That's why it's very important

00:36:23.171 --> 00:36:27.500
that this momentum that we have
be used, because it has a chance

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.180
that if it's conserved in one
frame,

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:32.352
it's conserved in all frames.
If you went and said,

00:36:32.352 --> 00:36:34.219
"You know what?
I don't like your formulas.

00:36:34.219 --> 00:36:37.308
I'm really wedded to this
formula for momentum," what you

00:36:37.308 --> 00:36:40.397
will find is that even if it's
conserved in your frame of

00:36:40.397 --> 00:36:42.508
reference,
in a different frame of

00:36:42.508 --> 00:36:45.244
reference, that combination,
sum over mv,

00:36:45.244 --> 00:36:49.039
will not be conserved.
Okay, that's the final property

00:36:49.039 --> 00:36:51.679
of four-vectors you've got to
use.

00:36:51.679 --> 00:36:54.497
Again, if you don't follow the
details, you must know that in

00:36:54.497 --> 00:36:57.267
collisions that we are going to
study we will add up all the

00:36:57.267 --> 00:36:59.380
[energy-momentum]
four-vectors coming in,

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.830
we'll equal them to all the
four-vectors going out.

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:05.499
That's it.
So, now I'm going to do sample

00:37:05.499 --> 00:37:08.519
problems to give you a feeling
for that.

00:37:08.519 --> 00:37:11.444
So, as usual,
they will start out with the

00:37:11.444 --> 00:37:15.440
simplest one and then try to
make it more complicated.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:20.003
So, the first problem is this.
I'm standing here,

00:37:20.003 --> 00:37:24.912
I've got some mass m,
and a photon is coming towards

00:37:24.912 --> 00:37:30.373
me with some momentum P.
And this hits me on the face

00:37:30.373 --> 00:37:34.180
and I absorb the photon.
It's completely possible for

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.700
the atoms forming the body to
absorb a photon.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:40.348
They absorb it;
so in the end there is no

00:37:40.348 --> 00:37:42.305
photon.
There is me,

00:37:42.305 --> 00:37:46.659
but possibly with a new mass,
m prime.

00:37:46.659 --> 00:37:51.954
In relativistic collision,
there is nothing called

00:37:51.954 --> 00:37:55.726
inelastic collisions.
Remember the old days when one

00:37:55.726 --> 00:37:58.469
thing came and stuck to another
thing, and they moved together?

00:37:58.469 --> 00:38:01.450
Momentum is conserved,
but energy is not.

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:04.587
There is no such thing.
Energy will always be conserved

00:38:04.587 --> 00:38:07.062
in relativistic theories.
In other words,

00:38:07.062 --> 00:38:10.833
even though this will become a
single unit, you might say,

00:38:10.833 --> 00:38:14.161
"What happened to the energy?
Previously, I had a moving

00:38:14.161 --> 00:38:15.840
photon, I got nothing moving
here."

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.550
Well, first of all,
I will be moving;

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:21.291
secondly, I will have more mass.
The best thing is to consider

00:38:21.291 --> 00:38:24.349
two particles coming in opposite
directions.

00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:25.960
They collide and form a new
mass.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.918
In relativity,
there is no momentum in the

00:38:28.918 --> 00:38:31.949
final particle,
it is not moving at all.

00:38:31.949 --> 00:38:35.199
But it will be more massive
than before, and that extra mass

00:38:35.199 --> 00:38:38.337
times c^(2) will be the
extra energy brought by the

00:38:38.337 --> 00:38:41.766
particles that are formed.
So anyway, the question here

00:38:41.766 --> 00:38:44.974
is, "What is m prime?"
That's what we have to figure

00:38:44.974 --> 00:38:47.614
out.
So, the equation we will use

00:38:47.614 --> 00:38:51.150
is, I will call my momentum as
P.

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:53.306
I will call
P_1 as the

00:38:53.306 --> 00:38:55.745
initial one, and
P_2 as the

00:38:55.745 --> 00:38:58.488
final one.
Let's write down all the

00:38:58.488 --> 00:39:02.889
equations we can;
the only equation in town is

00:39:02.889 --> 00:39:07.300
K + P_1 =
P_2.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:11.840
Everybody is a four-vector,
so don't be fooled.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.868
It's four equations.
But in this problem--;luckily,

00:39:14.868 --> 00:39:18.240
since there is no motion
perpendicular to the x

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.039
axis, we can have this x
momentum;

00:39:21.039 --> 00:39:22.329
there's no need for y
and z.

00:39:22.329 --> 00:39:25.511
Because the photon comes this
way, and I can start moving this

00:39:25.511 --> 00:39:28.380
way, but all the action is in
the x direction.

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.651
So, here it will be actually
two-dimensional vectors and not

00:39:31.651 --> 00:39:34.034
four.
There's nothing vertically

00:39:34.034 --> 00:39:36.720
before or after,
it will be 0 = 0.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.157
So, what are those equations?
Before you do that,

00:39:39.157 --> 00:39:41.809
let's write down the momentum
of the photon first.

00:39:41.809 --> 00:39:46.591
Momentum of the photon has got
some energy [should have said

00:39:46.591 --> 00:39:49.590
p_0]
/c,

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:53.287
and it's got some momentum
k, where  = kc,

00:39:53.287 --> 00:39:57.349
you've got to remember that.
P_1 has got an

00:39:57.349 --> 00:40:01.301
energy which is mc,
and no spatial momentum because

00:40:01.301 --> 00:40:02.550
I'm not moving.

00:40:06.219 --> 00:40:09.204
At the end of the day
P_2,

00:40:09.204 --> 00:40:12.190
I am moving,
but I also have a new mass,

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:15.597
and I have a new velocity,
which we don't know,

00:40:15.597 --> 00:40:19.672
and I have m prime
v divided by the square

00:40:19.672 --> 00:40:23.079
root of 1 minus
v^(2)/c^(2).

00:40:23.079 --> 00:40:30.219
Now,all of you should be able
to write this part down.

00:40:30.219 --> 00:40:31.995
If you're not,
you should take a minute,

00:40:31.995 --> 00:40:33.907
you should think about it,
you can stop me,

00:40:33.907 --> 00:40:36.415
you can question me.
But if you cannot do this,

00:40:36.415 --> 00:40:38.320
you cannot do any of the
problems.

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.160
You've got to think,
"Would I have done this?

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:44.294
Does it make sense to me?"
The bookkeeping is all in the

00:40:44.294 --> 00:40:46.213
top.
When you've got a material

00:40:46.213 --> 00:40:48.280
particle, it's first term,
0 component,

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.543
will be m times c
divided by the square root of

00:40:51.543 --> 00:40:54.422
all those things.
But if the particle is at rest,

00:40:54.422 --> 00:40:57.340
you only have mc.
There is no momentum.

00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:00.615
The final object,
me--After I got hit by the

00:41:00.615 --> 00:41:04.119
photon, I am recoiling;
so, I will have a velocity.

00:41:04.119 --> 00:41:06.602
I don't know what it is,
but my energy in terms of that,

00:41:06.602 --> 00:41:08.543
the first term,
p_0 will be

00:41:08.543 --> 00:41:09.546
this;
this will be

00:41:09.546 --> 00:41:12.562
P_1.
Now, the Law of Conservation of

00:41:12.562 --> 00:41:15.353
Energy and Momentum,
namely K_1 +

00:41:15.353 --> 00:41:18.639
P_1 = K_2 +
P_2,

00:41:18.639 --> 00:41:22.870
will really be saying all the
energy parts of the 0 components

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:26.606
will add up before and after,
and the first components will

00:41:26.606 --> 00:41:29.125
add before and after.
In other words,

00:41:29.125 --> 00:41:34.300
/c plus mc,
will be equal to m prime

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:40.418
c over this.
Then, k plus 0 will be

00:41:40.418 --> 00:41:47.639
equal to m prime v
divided by this.

00:41:47.639 --> 00:41:51.329
This is not any different from
the old days.

00:41:51.329 --> 00:41:53.883
You had Law of Conservation of
Momentum, you had Law of

00:41:53.883 --> 00:41:56.058
Conservation of Energy,
except energy is not ½

00:41:56.058 --> 00:41:58.630
mv^(2);
energy is this crazy thing.

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:02.793
Plus, even if a particle is not
moving, don't forget to give it

00:42:02.793 --> 00:42:05.410
mc as the energy;
that's the new part.

00:42:08.889 --> 00:42:11.929
So, what is the question I
asked you?

00:42:11.929 --> 00:42:13.590
I said, "What is m
prime."

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:17.784
So, your job is to take these
two simultaneous equations,

00:42:17.784 --> 00:42:21.830
this one and this one,
and solve for m prime.

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:32.761
So, what should I do?
Can you think of a strategy

00:42:32.761 --> 00:42:35.949
that will give me m
prime?

00:42:35.949 --> 00:42:39.386
Student:
[inaudible]

00:42:39.386 --> 00:42:46.920
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Into this one here?

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.848
Yes, you still have to solve
for m prime,

00:42:49.848 --> 00:42:52.590
and you also don't know the
velocity here.

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:54.142
Remember, you have to solve for
the velocity,

00:42:54.142 --> 00:42:55.800
and you have to solve for the
m prime.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.639
If you say what are the
unknowns and what are the

00:42:57.639 --> 00:43:01.083
knowns, let's be very clear.
The photon has a known momentum

00:43:01.083 --> 00:43:03.969
and known energy--that's given
to you.

00:43:03.969 --> 00:43:07.659
Initial me has a mass m,
that's given to you.

00:43:07.659 --> 00:43:10.236
Your job is to find the unknown
mass m prime,

00:43:10.236 --> 00:43:13.387
and the unknown velocity.
Two equations for two unknowns,

00:43:13.387 --> 00:43:16.847
but they're not simple linear
equations where you can add and

00:43:16.847 --> 00:43:19.154
subtract.
The simple linear equations are

00:43:19.154 --> 00:43:21.653
multiply this by three,
multiply that by four and

00:43:21.653 --> 00:43:23.840
subtract, and you'll get what
you want.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:27.497
But it's more complicated.
The trick that you really want

00:43:27.497 --> 00:43:32.302
to use is the fact that for any
particle, if you took the square

00:43:32.302 --> 00:43:35.780
of the 0 component,
subtract from it the square of

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:38.719
the spatial component,
the answer will be m

00:43:38.719 --> 00:43:41.521
prime square c^(2).
So, I'm saying:

00:43:41.521 --> 00:43:45.557
this square minus this square
will be m prime times

00:43:45.557 --> 00:43:48.599
c^(2),
and that you get by taking the

00:43:48.599 --> 00:43:51.210
square of this minus the square
of this.

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:54.225
You can juggle that,
but I'm not going to do it that

00:43:54.225 --> 00:43:57.596
way, I'm going to show you a
much more efficient and rapid

00:43:57.596 --> 00:44:01.516
way to do this.
So, let's do it the more

00:44:01.516 --> 00:44:06.758
efficient way,
so let me come down here so you

00:44:06.758 --> 00:44:10.460
can see.
Here is a shortcut.

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.153
The shortcut is to work
entirely with four-vectors and

00:44:13.153 --> 00:44:16.352
four-dimensional dot products,
and don't get down to the ugly

00:44:16.352 --> 00:44:18.239
business of writing each
component.

00:44:18.239 --> 00:44:22.209
We know that
P_2 is

00:44:22.209 --> 00:44:27.200
P_1 plus
K, right?

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:30.519
And who are we after?
We're after m prime;

00:44:30.519 --> 00:44:32.888
then we remember that
P_2^(2),

00:44:32.888 --> 00:44:36.132
namely P_2 dot
P_2 is equal to

00:44:36.132 --> 00:44:38.140
m prime square
c^(2).

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:41.749
Yes?
So, the question you are asked

00:44:41.749 --> 00:44:46.220
is--No one asked you how fast I
am moving after I got hit by the

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:48.447
photon;
you're only asking me what is

00:44:48.447 --> 00:44:51.035
my new rest mass.
See, I've swallowed a photon,

00:44:51.035 --> 00:44:53.150
so I weigh more;
it's really that.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:54.890
How much more do I weigh is the
question;

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:57.039
namely;
what is my rest mass.

00:44:57.039 --> 00:44:59.034
Namely, I swallowed it,
and I recoiled,

00:44:59.034 --> 00:45:01.395
and if you travel with me and
find me at rest,

00:45:01.395 --> 00:45:03.809
what mass m prime will
you measure?

00:45:03.809 --> 00:45:07.929
So, no one's asking me my
velocity of recoil v.

00:45:07.929 --> 00:45:09.800
So, you shouldn't bother to
calculate that.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.929
You could if you wanted to,
but no one is asking you that.

00:45:12.929 --> 00:45:15.510
So, go directly for
P_2^(2).

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:19.903
So, the quantity we're looking
for is m prime square

00:45:19.903 --> 00:45:22.361
c^(2).
That's got to be

00:45:22.361 --> 00:45:26.490
P_1 + K,
the whole thing square.

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:31.087
Well, do the old algebra.
That's equal to

00:45:31.087 --> 00:45:35.403
P_1^(2) + K^(2)
plus twice P_1

00:45:35.403 --> 00:45:36.500
dot K.

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:49.330
Okay, now let's see if I can do
what we do next.

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:50.780
Would you like to guess?
Yes?

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:54.181
No?
Do we know any of these

00:45:54.181 --> 00:45:58.203
quantities?
Do we know anything about the

00:45:58.203 --> 00:46:02.849
three terms I've written here?
Yes?

00:46:02.849 --> 00:46:05.032
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:46:05.032 --> 00:46:07.170
Shankar: K^(2) = 0
because of what?

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:08.599
Student:
[inaudible]

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:11.293
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: For a photon I

00:46:11.293 --> 00:46:14.371
told--For any particle the
square root of its momentum is

00:46:14.371 --> 00:46:17.670
really the square root of its
mass times c^(2).

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:19.490
For photons,
I told you long back,

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:24.106
K dot K is 0.
You don't have to worry about

00:46:24.106 --> 00:46:26.130
that.
How about the square of the

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:31.166
momentum of me?
Well, that was my rest mass

00:46:31.166 --> 00:46:36.619
before, times c^(2) plus
0.

00:46:36.619 --> 00:46:39.370
Now, P_1 dot
K you've got to be

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:41.444
careful.
That dot product means--let me

00:46:41.444 --> 00:46:43.947
write down the vector of
P_1 and

00:46:43.947 --> 00:46:46.620
K for you.
P_1 was

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.794
mc and 0,
and K was

00:46:48.794 --> 00:46:51.852
/c,
and the spatial momentum,

00:46:51.852 --> 00:46:54.910
where  was equal to
kc.

00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:57.280
Remember that?
For a photon,

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.400
once you pick the energy,
you have no choice with the

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.601
momentum.
The magnitude of the momentum

00:47:02.601 --> 00:47:05.409
has to be the magnitude of
energy divided by c.

00:47:05.409 --> 00:47:07.092
So, let's take
P_1 dot

00:47:07.092 --> 00:47:08.170
K;
let's try to do

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:09.550
P_1 dot
K.

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:14.760
Remember the dot product of two
vectors is time times time.

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:19.124
mc times  over
c minus space dot space,

00:47:19.124 --> 00:47:20.040
that was 0.

00:47:26.559 --> 00:47:29.997
So, I cancel that,
and I find it's really

00:47:29.997 --> 00:47:31.200
m.

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:40.940
And that's equal to m
prime c^(2).

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:44.658
Yes?
Student:

00:47:44.658 --> 00:47:48.030
Can you just remind me what the
 stands for again?

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:49.798
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yeah,

00:47:49.798 --> 00:47:52.274
the photon, remember the
four-vector's first component is

00:47:52.274 --> 00:47:54.725
energy over c.
Second component is the

00:47:54.725 --> 00:47:57.239
momentum.
It's traditional to call the

00:47:57.239 --> 00:48:00.409
energy of the photon by the
symbol Ω.

00:48:00.409 --> 00:48:03.094
And it's traditional to call
the momentum of the photon,

00:48:03.094 --> 00:48:05.290
the usual momentum,
by the symbol K.

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.331
And that's very helpful;
otherwise, you're going to have

00:48:08.331 --> 00:48:09.929
P_1 and
P_2 and

00:48:09.929 --> 00:48:11.960
P_1 sub-0 and
K_1 sub-0,

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.833
too many indices.
So, what we're trying to do is

00:48:14.833 --> 00:48:17.359
whenever we write a K
whose components are 

00:48:17.359 --> 00:48:19.456
and little k,
we know we're talking about a

00:48:19.456 --> 00:48:21.277
photon.
And whenever I write a

00:48:21.277 --> 00:48:24.190
P, I know I'm talking
about the electron.

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:27.510
So,  is just the
energy of the photon.

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:32.521
So now, if I cancel all the
c squares,

00:48:32.521 --> 00:48:38.672
then I get m prime
square plus m^(2) plus

00:48:38.672 --> 00:48:43.365
2m/c^(2).
Now, you can take the square

00:48:43.365 --> 00:48:45.280
root, if you like,
and that's the answer.

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:56.752
So, my mass would have gone up.
You might think,

00:48:56.752 --> 00:48:58.460
"How much would the mass have
gone up?"

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:01.142
First of all,
this guy swallowed a photon of

00:49:01.142 --> 00:49:03.825
energy ,
so maybe that energy over

00:49:03.825 --> 00:49:06.570
c^(2) will be the change
in mass.

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:10.207
That is not correct,
and you've got to think about

00:49:10.207 --> 00:49:13.840
why that is not the answer.
Why is that wrong?

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:17.160
Why doesn't the photon energy
turn into my extra mass?

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.648
Yes?
Student:

00:49:18.648 --> 00:49:19.876
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:49:19.876 --> 00:49:22.794
Shankar: In other words,
when I absorb the photon,

00:49:22.794 --> 00:49:26.464
I also have to recoil to
conserve the momentum of the

00:49:26.464 --> 00:49:28.090
photon.
Consequently,

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:32.056
my final energy will equal old
energy plus photon energy,

00:49:32.056 --> 00:49:35.881
but that does not mean all of
it is rest energy because

00:49:35.881 --> 00:49:39.554
there's some energy of motion.
So, you've got to make sure

00:49:39.554 --> 00:49:42.163
that in the end you calculate it
so that the total energy is

00:49:42.163 --> 00:49:44.329
balanced, but it's not contained
in rest mass.

00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:46.823
Because you produce the [extra]
rest mass, and you also move

00:49:46.823 --> 00:49:48.371
the rest mass.
And for all of that you've got

00:49:48.371 --> 00:49:49.650
only the energy of the photon to
work with.

00:49:55.140 --> 00:50:01.911
Okay, so this is one problem.
I was going to do one or two

00:50:01.911 --> 00:50:03.900
more, but I want to make sure
you guys are following;

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:06.706
I just don't know.
See, if I ask you what you

00:50:06.706 --> 00:50:08.778
would do next,
if you have some idea,

00:50:08.778 --> 00:50:11.195
then we can proceed,
but if you don't know,

00:50:11.195 --> 00:50:15.032
maybe we should slow down.
And you've got to talk about

00:50:15.032 --> 00:50:18.110
which part of it you find more
difficult.

00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:22.224
So, let me say a few things.
And the first time you hear

00:50:22.224 --> 00:50:24.687
something that you find
difficult, you've got to put

00:50:24.687 --> 00:50:25.750
your hand up,
okay?

00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:28.030
Otherwise, you're not going to
make progress.

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:32.220
The first thing I say is this:
particles of mass have an

00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:36.943
energy and momentum that depend
on their velocity and rest mass

00:50:36.943 --> 00:50:41.388
as given by the first equation.
And the energy and momentum are

00:50:41.388 --> 00:50:44.830
assembled into a four-vector,
the first component of which is

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:48.100
E/c, the second component
is just the momentum.

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:51.972
That much you should know.
Secondly, if you took the dot

00:50:51.972 --> 00:50:56.320
product of that vector with
itself, and the dot product is

00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:00.137
defined to be Lorentz invariant,
so that it is the same for all

00:51:00.137 --> 00:51:01.513
people, that's
p_0^(2) -

00:51:01.513 --> 00:51:03.431
p_1^(2),
you'll always get

00:51:03.431 --> 00:51:06.599
m^(2)c^(2) for any
particle of mass independent of

00:51:06.599 --> 00:51:09.299
its state of motion.
And the simplest way to

00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:13.132
remember that is to evaluate the
dot product in the frame moving

00:51:13.132 --> 00:51:15.017
with the particle.
In that frame,

00:51:15.017 --> 00:51:16.491
it only has a
p_0,

00:51:16.491 --> 00:51:18.442
which is mc,
and doesn't have a spatial

00:51:18.442 --> 00:51:21.079
momentum;
so that's got to be the answer.

00:51:21.079 --> 00:51:23.164
Second thing,
when you deal with photons,

00:51:23.164 --> 00:51:25.854
they're a little tricky.
Photons have energy,

00:51:25.854 --> 00:51:29.190
photons have momentum,
but energy is not mass times

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:31.860
some velocity square over 2
etcetera.

00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:35.159
They have no mass,
but they have energy and they

00:51:35.159 --> 00:51:38.318
have momentum,
and the condition of the photon

00:51:38.318 --> 00:51:42.179
is that the energy must be
momentum times c.

00:51:42.179 --> 00:51:45.320
That will make sure that
K dot K is 0.

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:48.742
Because for a particle of mass
m, I showed you the

00:51:48.742 --> 00:51:52.104
relation, E^(2) =
(c times P)^(2) +

00:51:52.104 --> 00:51:54.159
m^(2) c^(4).
For a photon,

00:51:54.159 --> 00:51:57.610
there is no m.
That means E = pc.

00:51:57.610 --> 00:52:01.779
So, photon energy and photon
momentum have relative

00:52:01.779 --> 00:52:03.679
magnitude.
Yes?

00:52:03.679 --> 00:52:06.630
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:09.219
Shankar: That's what I'm
telling you.

00:52:09.219 --> 00:52:11.312
For a photon,
it's not defined as mv

00:52:11.312 --> 00:52:13.776
over something.
It is not defined that way

00:52:13.776 --> 00:52:17.321
because you don't even get off
first base because m

00:52:17.321 --> 00:52:20.679
vanishes, and v = 0,
you're in real trouble.

00:52:20.679 --> 00:52:22.753
So, you've got to realize that
for a photon there's an

00:52:22.753 --> 00:52:24.239
exception of how you think about
it.

00:52:24.239 --> 00:52:26.361
You don't think of it as an
object of some mass that moves

00:52:26.361 --> 00:52:27.850
and has some energy and some
momentum.

00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:31.166
It always moves at one speed.
You might say,

00:52:31.166 --> 00:52:33.612
if it always moves at one
speed, it must have only one

00:52:33.612 --> 00:52:35.720
unique momentum.
That's not true either.

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:38.192
So, they are a little tricky.
For photons,

00:52:38.192 --> 00:52:41.826
you have to accept the fact
that photons have energy and

00:52:41.826 --> 00:52:44.800
photons have momentum,
with E = pc.

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.191
And apart form that,
there is no restriction,

00:52:47.191 --> 00:52:50.181
you can give a photon any
energy you like as long as the

00:52:50.181 --> 00:52:53.659
momentum you give it is such
that E^(2) = c^(2)p^(2).

00:52:53.659 --> 00:52:56.710
And you cannot go to the frame
in which the photon is at rest;

00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:59.039
there is no such thing,
it has no rest mass.

00:52:59.039 --> 00:53:02.164
But particles with no rest mass
can have energy,

00:53:02.164 --> 00:53:05.602
and can have momentum.
When enough photons hit you,

00:53:05.602 --> 00:53:08.630
you can feel the force,
that's called radiation

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:10.737
pressure.
So, they carry momentum,

00:53:10.737 --> 00:53:13.263
they carry energy,
but the formula for momentum

00:53:13.263 --> 00:53:15.570
energy is not written in terms
of mass.

00:53:15.570 --> 00:53:17.950
So, that's the second thing
I've said.

00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:20.278
Yes?
Student:

00:53:20.278 --> 00:53:23.243
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:53:23.243 --> 00:53:27.150
Shankar: For the photon?
Yes.

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:30.705
k_0 =
k_1 for the

00:53:30.705 --> 00:53:32.424
photon.
And if I wrote

00:53:32.424 --> 00:53:34.931
k_0 as
/c,

00:53:34.931 --> 00:53:39.909
then it means  = kc.
That's the second statement.

00:53:39.909 --> 00:53:41.930
That's not obvious from
anything I've taught you.

00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:44.015
So, that's some new stuff.
Because suddenly,

00:53:44.015 --> 00:53:47.087
I've got an object with no mass
and the whole derivation for

00:53:47.087 --> 00:53:50.420
momentum started with m
times some velocity and so on,

00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:53.675
so that fails for photons.
But they exist and they carry

00:53:53.675 --> 00:53:57.404
energy, they carry momentum.
You should think of them as

00:53:57.404 --> 00:54:02.010
particles that obey E^(2) =
(cp)^(2) + m^(2)c^(4),

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:05.470
with m = 0,
so they obey E = pc.

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:09.089
That's a second statement.
Third statement is,

00:54:09.089 --> 00:54:12.750
in a collision you add up all
the Ps and the Ks

00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:15.763
for everybody on the left,
and that equals the sum of all

00:54:15.763 --> 00:54:17.670
the Ps and the Ks
on the right.

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:22.381
And you do that so you've got
to make sure you can do that

00:54:22.381 --> 00:54:23.703
part.
For particles,

00:54:23.703 --> 00:54:26.253
I will tell you this particle
has this rest mass,

00:54:26.253 --> 00:54:29.239
it's going at this velocity.
And you should be able to build

00:54:29.239 --> 00:54:31.286
up its energy and momentum.
For photons,

00:54:31.286 --> 00:54:35.193
I won't tell you this is the
velocity, velocity is always

00:54:35.193 --> 00:54:36.440
c.
For photons,

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.489
I'll have to tell you this is
the  of the photon;

00:54:38.489 --> 00:54:39.980
this is the k of the
photon.

00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:42.461
So, you form a little a
vector with /c

00:54:42.461 --> 00:54:44.780
as the first component,
and k as the second one.

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:47.977
Then it's very easy.
Add all the first column,

00:54:47.977 --> 00:54:49.293
second column,
third column,

00:54:49.293 --> 00:54:51.193
fourth column,
and those four things are

00:54:51.193 --> 00:54:54.130
separately conserved.
That's it.

00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:58.066
That's the trick to collisions,
balancing energy and momentum

00:54:58.066 --> 00:55:01.346
in one mega equation,
which is four-momentum before

00:55:01.346 --> 00:55:05.134
equals four-momentum after.
And the beauty is any observer

00:55:05.134 --> 00:55:08.409
can look at this collision from
any frame of reference;

00:55:08.409 --> 00:55:11.048
different people will disagree
on what's the energy and what's

00:55:11.048 --> 00:55:13.207
the momentum of the particle.
For example,

00:55:13.207 --> 00:55:16.407
in this example I gave you,
I said I am at rest,

00:55:16.407 --> 00:55:19.539
and I got hit by a photon,
then I'm moving.

00:55:19.539 --> 00:55:22.375
Well, that's the point of view
of some observers for whom I was

00:55:22.375 --> 00:55:24.665
at rest initially.
You can see the whole thing

00:55:24.665 --> 00:55:26.217
from a rocket.
In that case,

00:55:26.217 --> 00:55:29.729
my initial momentum will have a
spatial part because on the

00:55:29.729 --> 00:55:31.909
rocket, I'll be moving
backwards.

00:55:31.909 --> 00:55:34.214
This photon will also have a
new  and a new

00:55:34.214 --> 00:55:36.829
k, which you can find
from Lorentz transformation;

00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:39.124
this final object will be
moving at some speed,

00:55:39.124 --> 00:55:40.920
so everything will look
different.

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:43.946
Nonetheless,
the momentum and energy will

00:55:43.946 --> 00:55:47.200
balance on the two sides for you
as well.

00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:51.708
Yes?
Student:

00:55:51.708 --> 00:55:59.318
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:55:59.318 --> 00:56:04.855
Shankar: No.
You've got to be very careful

00:56:04.855 --> 00:56:07.416
about what you mean by mass.
Some people think of mass as

00:56:07.416 --> 00:56:10.679
m divided by square root
of 1 minus v square root.

00:56:10.679 --> 00:56:12.730
I never want to take that point
of view.

00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:16.167
The only mass is the rest mass,
and nobody will disagree on

00:56:16.167 --> 00:56:18.420
what the rest mass of a particle
is.

00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:21.478
Do you understand that?
I may think the particle is at

00:56:21.478 --> 00:56:24.400
rest, you may think it's moving,
that's just fine.

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.670
But if we both ask the
following question,

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:30.269
"What is its mass in a frame in
which the particle is at rest?"

00:56:30.269 --> 00:56:32.940
the answer to that question is
a unique answer.

00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:34.851
To find that,
you go sit with the particle

00:56:34.851 --> 00:56:37.043
and you find its mass.
So, the rest mass,

00:56:37.043 --> 00:56:39.430
in this case m and
m prime,

00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:42.660
are the same for all people.
You can see the whole collision

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:44.398
on the rocket,
the m prime is the

00:56:44.398 --> 00:56:46.624
m prime.
E and p are

00:56:46.624 --> 00:56:49.645
transforming as Lorentz
variables, but m is the

00:56:49.645 --> 00:56:53.137
length squared of a four-vector;
therefore, it's the same for

00:56:53.137 --> 00:56:59.416
all people.
Now I want to do a second very

00:56:59.416 --> 00:57:06.180
interesting problem,
which is this.

00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:12.842
The year is 1953 or '54.
You are trying to build a

00:57:12.842 --> 00:57:16.364
collider in Berkeley.
It's going to have a proton

00:57:16.364 --> 00:57:16.940
target.

00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:23.400
By the way, I'm going to show
you one more trick that's very

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:26.199
useful.
Put c = 1 everywhere.

00:57:26.199 --> 00:57:29.349
You can always put c = 1
by choice of units.

00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:32.014
For example,
if your unit of length instead

00:57:32.014 --> 00:57:35.250
of being a meter stick was 3
times 10^(8) meters,

00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:38.955
and that was your new unit of
length, let's call it a light

00:57:38.955 --> 00:57:41.284
second.
For you, the velocity of light

00:57:41.284 --> 00:57:44.034
is 1 because it goes 1 light
second in 1 second,

00:57:44.034 --> 00:57:46.139
the distance over time will be
1.

00:57:46.139 --> 00:57:48.828
Even if that's not your unit,
I say forget about c,

00:57:48.828 --> 00:57:52.005
do the math without c;
in the end you can always put

00:57:52.005 --> 00:57:54.486
back the c.
We'll always know in the end

00:57:54.486 --> 00:57:57.929
how to put back the c.
Maybe I have an example here.

00:57:57.929 --> 00:58:01.575
Yeah, in this problem,
if I've forgotten c

00:58:01.575 --> 00:58:05.220
everywhere, I get an answer that
looks like this:

00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:09.550
m prime square is
m^(2) + 2m.

00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:13.408
I already know that if that's
the mass square and that's the

00:58:13.408 --> 00:58:15.617
mass squared.
Well, that's the mass,

00:58:15.617 --> 00:58:18.238
and that's an energy,
so I know that should be a

00:58:18.238 --> 00:58:20.333
c^(2) here.
You can always fudge the

00:58:20.333 --> 00:58:22.718
c^(2); at the end of the
day, there's no reason to carry

00:58:22.718 --> 00:58:25.270
it from the beginning.
Just from dimensional analysis,

00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:27.783
when you're looking for energy
and you see a mass,

00:58:27.783 --> 00:58:30.434
put a c^(2) there.
When you're looking for a mass

00:58:30.434 --> 00:58:32.257
and you see an energy and it
should be a mass,

00:58:32.257 --> 00:58:34.690
divide by c^(2).
So, that's what I'm going to do.

00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:39.133
So, here is a proton at rest.
Here is a proton that I've

00:58:39.133 --> 00:58:43.123
created from my Bevatron,
which is going to come and

00:58:43.123 --> 00:58:46.606
smash into this.
And the job of this reaction is

00:58:46.606 --> 00:58:49.246
the following:
where this notation is very

00:58:49.246 --> 00:58:52.466
unfortunate [p + p],
this is not a momentum,

00:58:52.466 --> 00:58:56.655
this stands for proton.
Proton plus proton should form

00:58:56.655 --> 00:59:01.425
two protons and a new proton and
anti-proton created from the

00:59:01.425 --> 00:59:03.559
vacuum.
Created from nowhere.

00:59:03.559 --> 00:59:06.170
This is what happens in a
collider.

00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:10.222
Particles and anti-particles
are created in pairs using the

00:59:10.222 --> 00:59:14.471
incoming energy.
So, it's the opposite of the

00:59:14.471 --> 00:59:16.863
atomic bomb.
In an atomic bomb,

00:59:16.863 --> 00:59:19.150
mass is destroyed and energy is
created.

00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:23.179
In an accelerator,
energy is converted into mass.

00:59:23.179 --> 00:59:26.584
Which is why two particles can
go in, and four particles,

00:59:26.584 --> 00:59:29.808
or ten, or 14,000 can come out.
We want to look at the

00:59:29.808 --> 00:59:33.019
experiment where people were
trying to make anti-protons.

00:59:33.019 --> 00:59:37.272
The theory says the anti-proton
mass is the same as the proton

00:59:37.272 --> 00:59:39.461
mass.
It's a very general symmetry of

00:59:39.461 --> 00:59:41.717
the theory.
But you want to make it,

00:59:41.717 --> 00:59:45.046
and the question is,
"What is the minimum energy of

00:59:45.046 --> 00:59:49.240
this incoming proton that will
make this reaction possible?"

00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:50.860
And this guy starts out at rest.

00:59:56.239 --> 01:00:00.926
So, what energy or what
momentum should the incoming

01:00:00.926 --> 01:00:03.389
projectile have?
Yes?

01:00:03.389 --> 01:00:08.045
Student:
[inaudible]

01:00:08.045 --> 01:00:16.639
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Let's see.

01:00:16.639 --> 01:00:20.400
So, here are four protons,
and in the cheapest collision

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.929
what will they be doing in the
end?

01:00:22.929 --> 01:00:24.540
Student:
[inaudible]

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:28.070
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Sitting in a clump.

01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:30.110
And what will be the energy of
that clump?

01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:31.835
Student:
[inaudible]

01:00:31.835 --> 01:00:35.420
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Do you agree that's

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:37.510
4m?
Student: Yes.

01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:38.985
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Okay,

01:00:38.985 --> 01:00:41.124
this guy brings energy into the
collision, being the static

01:00:41.124 --> 01:00:43.069
target.
So, you would conclude the

01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:45.199
energy of this should be
3m.

01:00:45.199 --> 01:00:49.765
By that we'll mean
mc^(2) divided by 1 minus

01:00:49.765 --> 01:00:55.700
v^(2) over c^(2)
should be 3 times mc^(2).

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:58.958
That's the energy.
Because that 3m plus

01:00:58.958 --> 01:01:01.510
this m will make
4m.

01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:04.850
Yes?
Student:

01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:10.396
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

01:01:10.396 --> 01:01:15.319
Shankar: No.
The mass of these particles is

01:01:15.319 --> 01:01:18.755
always m.
I'm saying the energy of this

01:01:18.755 --> 01:01:22.340
guy is 3m.
Yes?

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:24.518
If this is 3m and that
guys brings an m just by

01:01:24.518 --> 01:01:26.591
sitting there,
and we need 4m to make

01:01:26.591 --> 01:01:29.010
four particles,
and we want the cheapest deal,

01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:33.250
so nobody is doing anything.
But this wrong.

01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:37.430
This is an underestimate for
what you need.

01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:41.025
You need more.
You've got to think about why

01:01:41.025 --> 01:01:43.190
do we need more energy than
this?

01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:47.670
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:51.330
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No.

01:01:51.330 --> 01:01:53.594
Let's say they don't annihilate;
they form and they just--they

01:01:53.594 --> 01:01:55.960
don't annihilate that fast,
so they can be produced.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:58.820
Anti-protons can be produced.
That's not the reason why.

01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:01.909
I want you to visualize the
question we're asking.

01:02:01.909 --> 01:02:04.431
Obviously, if we send a
super-duper proton beam,

01:02:04.431 --> 01:02:07.597
it can knock the hell out of
this proton and produce however

01:02:07.597 --> 01:02:10.321
many particles you want.
We want the minimum energy,

01:02:10.321 --> 01:02:12.765
and the picture we have is
what's the minimum energy of

01:02:12.765 --> 01:02:15.152
four particles?
Well, it's four particles at

01:02:15.152 --> 01:02:16.663
rest.
That's the one for which we

01:02:16.663 --> 01:02:18.707
computed the energy,
but there's something wrong

01:02:18.707 --> 01:02:20.750
with our argument.
Yes?

01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:21.782
Student:
[inaudible]

01:02:21.782 --> 01:02:23.450
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes.

01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:26.353
Let me repeat what he said.
The Law of Conservation of

01:02:26.353 --> 01:02:29.333
Momentum will not allow you to
take a situation where the

01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:32.308
proton comes in with momentum.
This guy is doing nothing,

01:02:32.308 --> 01:02:34.277
and you cannot have four
particles at rest,

01:02:34.277 --> 01:02:37.875
because their momentum is 0.
Therefore, the four guys who

01:02:37.875 --> 01:02:42.012
are produced must be drifting
forward with some minimum

01:02:42.012 --> 01:02:46.610
momentum, so that that momentum
equals incoming momentum.

01:02:46.610 --> 01:02:49.483
That means, you've got to pay
the price to make them,

01:02:49.483 --> 01:02:52.855
you've got to pay the price to
move them at a minimum momentum

01:02:52.855 --> 01:02:54.900
to balance the incoming
momentum.

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:58.901
So, that should tell you that
the real energy of the incoming

01:02:58.901 --> 01:03:02.436
particle has got to be more than
just whatever I said,

01:03:02.436 --> 01:03:04.503
3m.
So, we've got to find out the

01:03:04.503 --> 01:03:07.351
real momentum.
So, the trick is again going to

01:03:07.351 --> 01:03:10.393
be the same.
So, this is the initial state,

01:03:10.393 --> 01:03:14.023
this is the final state,
but this final state has got

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:19.170
some motion.
It cannot be at rest.

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:24.640
So, what's the initial momentum?
Initial momentum for this guy

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:28.917
is some energy E;
for this guy is some mass

01:03:28.917 --> 01:03:31.413
m.
And the momentum of this is

01:03:31.413 --> 01:03:35.335
some number P.
And the momentum of this guy is

01:03:35.335 --> 01:03:36.460
0;
that's the initial momentum.

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:43.340
And that's got to be equal to
the final momentum.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.207
Very good.
Final momentum you can write

01:03:52.207 --> 01:03:54.729
down in detail by taking these
four masses, giving them some

01:03:54.729 --> 01:03:56.910
velocities, but I'm not going to
do any of that.

01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:58.739
Yes?
Student:

01:03:58.739 --> 01:04:00.608
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

01:04:00.608 --> 01:04:03.667
Shankar: This m,
this particle has an energy

01:04:03.667 --> 01:04:07.690
m.
It's really mc.

01:04:07.690 --> 01:04:12.179
Sorry, it's E/c,
mc and 0.

01:04:12.179 --> 01:04:16.960
This guy has got E/c and
some momentum P.

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:20.674
I've forgotten the c.
Remember, we agreed that we're

01:04:20.674 --> 01:04:22.570
not going to worry about
c in this problem?

01:04:22.570 --> 01:04:23.340
So, this is just m.

01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:29.707
So, this is the initial
momentum, that's going to be the

01:04:29.707 --> 01:04:32.556
final momentum.
That also means initial

01:04:32.556 --> 01:04:36.440
momentum square is final
momentum squared.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.789
If two vectors are equal,
the squares are equal.

01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:43.449
Now, the final momentum
squared, I say we can evaluate

01:04:43.449 --> 01:04:48.021
not in the lab frame,
but in another frame called the

01:04:48.021 --> 01:04:51.947
center of mass frame.
And here is a center of mass

01:04:51.947 --> 01:04:54.086
frame.
Suppose you start moving to the

01:04:54.086 --> 01:04:56.950
right at some speed,
what do you think will happen?

01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:59.739
Imagine in your head.
You move to the right,

01:04:59.739 --> 01:05:02.930
this proton will start moving
to the left, this proton

01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:05.340
will appear slower.
Is that clear to you?

01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:09.360
Pick up your speed until
they're coming in exactly

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:13.562
opposite momenta.
That's a frame of reference you

01:05:13.562 --> 01:05:15.477
can imagine.
In that frame,

01:05:15.477 --> 01:05:17.670
the collision looks rather
different.

01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:19.694
In that frame,
this guy and this guy are

01:05:19.694 --> 01:05:22.134
approaching each other with
opposite velocities,

01:05:22.134 --> 01:05:24.470
and therefore equal and
opposite momenta;

01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:27.145
the total momentum is 0.
In that frame,

01:05:27.145 --> 01:05:31.406
these two guys are allowed to
go into four sitting ducks,

01:05:31.406 --> 01:05:34.070
because the total momentum is
0.

01:05:37.909 --> 01:05:40.932
So, that is the frame of
reference called the center of

01:05:40.932 --> 01:05:43.900
mass frame in which incoming
momentum adds up to 0,

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:46.849
so the final particles are
allowed to be at rest if they

01:05:46.849 --> 01:05:49.210
want to, and the minimum energy
collision,

01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:52.635
they will be produced at rest,
because that's the least

01:05:52.635 --> 01:05:55.104
expensive way.
So, I found a frame in which

01:05:55.104 --> 01:05:57.289
this is possible.
That's not the lab frame,

01:05:57.289 --> 01:05:59.840
that's the fame in which they
are moving in opposite

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.774
directions.
But what's the total momentum

01:06:02.774 --> 01:06:06.918
in this frame?
Total momentum in this frame,

01:06:06.918 --> 01:06:09.804
P total,
is 4m,

01:06:09.804 --> 01:06:10.320
0.

01:06:16.429 --> 01:06:20.636
Now, no one says the total
momentum in that frame has to be

01:06:20.636 --> 01:06:25.349
the total momentum in my frame,
but--sorry, say P final.

01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:28.512
No one says that P final
should be my P final,

01:06:28.512 --> 01:06:31.514
but the square of that P
final is the square of my

01:06:31.514 --> 01:06:34.623
P final because the
square of any vector is the same

01:06:34.623 --> 01:06:38.097
for all observers.
So, what is P final

01:06:38.097 --> 01:06:40.659
square?
You guys should know by now.

01:06:40.659 --> 01:06:45.103
This dot product of this vector
with itself is the square of

01:06:45.103 --> 01:06:48.289
this number minus 0.
There is nothing here.

01:06:48.289 --> 01:06:54.208
Therefore, I argue here,
that P initial square is

01:06:54.208 --> 01:06:59.771
equal to P final square.
That I calculate in the center

01:06:59.771 --> 01:07:02.520
of mass frame,
and I get 16m^(2).

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.921
Yes?
Student:

01:07:04.921 --> 01:07:07.014
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

01:07:07.014 --> 01:07:10.041
Shankar: Right.
Why is the square of the

01:07:10.041 --> 01:07:13.510
four-momentum the same in two
frames of reference?

01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:18.840
Anybody answer that?
Why is the momentum not equal,

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:23.510
but the square is equal?
Why is that?

01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:26.721
Because it's a dot product of a
vector with itself,

01:07:26.721 --> 01:07:30.511
and the whole idea of defining
these squares is so that they

01:07:30.511 --> 01:07:34.472
are the same for all observers.
The whole idea of defining

01:07:34.472 --> 01:07:38.159
four-vectors is that when you
take the length square of a

01:07:38.159 --> 01:07:40.860
four-vector defined in this
crazy way,

01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:42.751
0 component squared minus the
first component squared,

01:07:42.751 --> 01:07:45.090
that's the same for all people,
right?

01:07:45.090 --> 01:07:48.898
That's the beauty.
That's why, if you really look

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:52.271
at the total momentum vector in
the lab frame,

01:07:52.271 --> 01:07:55.755
it looks like this.
And that's got to be the final

01:07:55.755 --> 01:07:59.993
total momentum too.
These numbers are not--they are

01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:02.488
both non-0.
So, no one says the total

01:08:02.488 --> 01:08:05.853
momentum vector is the same.
In the center of mass frame it

01:08:05.853 --> 01:08:08.529
looks like this,
but the square of the vector

01:08:08.529 --> 01:08:11.630
must be the square of the vector
for all people.

01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:15.010
Now, let me finish this and
maybe we'll have a discussion.

01:08:15.010 --> 01:08:17.425
So, P initial square is
16m^(2),

01:08:17.425 --> 01:08:22.701
so this is the top most line.
Find the square of this vector,

01:08:22.701 --> 01:08:29.110
is (E + m)^(2) -
P^(2) = 16m^(2).

01:08:36.199 --> 01:08:37.960
Now, so, let's see where to
write this;

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:38.280
maybe I'll write it here.

01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:51.235
That means E^(2) + m^(2)
+ 2Em - p^(2) =

01:08:51.235 --> 01:08:53.450
16m^(2).

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:06.170
But you must know that E^(2)
- p^(2) is an m^(2).

01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:10.441
I'm saying E^(2) = p^(2) +
m^(2), if you banish all

01:09:10.441 --> 01:09:14.005
factors of c^(2).
So, this E^(2) - p^(2)

01:09:14.005 --> 01:09:17.282
is an m^(2);
there is already an

01:09:17.282 --> 01:09:22.062
m^(2) here,
so I get 2m^(2) +

01:09:22.062 --> 01:09:28.503
2Em = 16m^(2).
You cancel the 2 and make it

01:09:28.503 --> 01:09:32.976
14m^(2),
and you divide by 2m,

01:09:32.976 --> 01:09:38.248
you find E = 7m.
By the way, this is posted on

01:09:38.248 --> 01:09:41.706
the web, on the internets.
So, you guys can read it

01:09:41.706 --> 01:09:44.695
whenever you like.
So, don't worry about this last

01:09:44.695 --> 01:09:47.464
detail;
I've given you every possible

01:09:47.464 --> 01:09:49.927
detail here.
If you didn't get every factor,

01:09:49.927 --> 01:09:52.175
it doesn't matter.
What I want you to understand

01:09:52.175 --> 01:09:54.944
is, I've also given you the
whole argument on how you go to

01:09:54.944 --> 01:09:57.974
this frame and that frame.
The point is you can answer

01:09:57.974 --> 01:10:01.142
E = 7m,
now we realize it's time to put

01:10:01.142 --> 01:10:04.367
back the velocity of light,
and everybody knows,

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:08.002
even man and woman on the
street, that this should be

01:10:08.002 --> 01:10:10.691
really 7mc^(2).
If we carried factors of

01:10:10.691 --> 01:10:12.810
c throughout the
calculation, it would have been

01:10:12.810 --> 01:10:14.599
very messy,
but here is where c^(2)

01:10:14.599 --> 01:10:17.106
would have to turn up.
So, if you're looking for an

01:10:17.106 --> 01:10:20.329
energy and you get a mass,
you put back the c^(2).

01:10:20.329 --> 01:10:23.052
So, what we are told is,
the incoming proton,

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:25.032
as it moves,
its energy goes from

01:10:25.032 --> 01:10:27.939
mc^(2) to bigger and
bigger numbers,

01:10:27.939 --> 01:10:30.196
because the denominator of 1
over v^(2) over

01:10:30.196 --> 01:10:33.167
c^(2) is vanishing.
Wait until the energy is 7

01:10:33.167 --> 01:10:36.583
times the rest energy,
and when it's 7 times the rest

01:10:36.583 --> 01:10:39.267
energy,
that's when it's ready to hit

01:10:39.267 --> 01:10:43.321
the static proton and produce
proton/anti-proton pairs from

01:10:43.321 --> 01:10:45.886
nowhere.
So, some of the 7m^(2)

01:10:45.886 --> 01:10:49.602
is going to give a momentum to
the fragment of the collision,

01:10:49.602 --> 01:10:52.989
and some is to create them.
And the way we found out the

01:10:52.989 --> 01:10:55.939
minimum energy is we did
energy-momentum calculation.

01:10:55.939 --> 01:10:58.640
But the minimum energy
configuration is easily imagined

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:01.340
in the center of mass frame,
that's the whole point.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.310
Not in the lab frame,
the center of mass frame.

01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:05.894
That's why accelerators,
nowadays, are taking one

01:11:05.894 --> 01:11:09.126
particle that can move faster
and faster and hitting a target

01:11:09.126 --> 01:11:11.711
they produce intersecting
storage rings where the

01:11:11.711 --> 01:11:14.350
particles are going in opposite
directions.

01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:16.930
And every time they meet in the
racetrack, they're allowed to

01:11:16.930 --> 01:11:19.210
collide.
What's the beauty of that?

01:11:19.210 --> 01:11:22.189
The beauty of that is,
since they come with opposite

01:11:22.189 --> 01:11:25.520
momenta, the final fragments
don't have to move at all.

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.609
So, you can make more and more
mass.

01:11:27.609 --> 01:11:30.188
So, don't put your energy all
into one beam and a static

01:11:30.188 --> 01:11:32.356
target;
put them into two oppositely

01:11:32.356 --> 01:11:35.464
moving beams.
Then, all the energy is

01:11:35.464 --> 01:11:40.119
available for producing mass.
All right, so I'll stop now.

01:11:40.119 --> 01:11:42.881
I think this is a difficult
chapter, so you have to go and

01:11:42.881 --> 01:11:45.837
read, and you have to talk to
each other and try to do as many

01:11:45.837 --> 01:11:47.237
problems as you can.

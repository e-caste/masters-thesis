WAI CHEE DIMOCK: So just want
to go back very

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:07.667
briefly to the title
of As I Lay Dying.

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:12.300
As you guys know, the title
is taken from The

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.167
Odyssey, Book XI.

00:00:14.167 --> 00:00:25.067
And Odysseus has gone to the
underworld, and he's talking

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:29.300
to Agamemnon, who's telling him
about the circumstances of

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.200
his death and his murder by
his wife, Clytemnestra.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.367
So, "As I lay dying, the woman
with the dog's eye would not

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:41.100
close my eyes as I descended
into Hades."

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.267
So this is the original
inspiring moment in many ways

00:00:48.267 --> 00:00:53.367
for Faulkner, and today I'd
like to talk a little more

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:58.500
about the whole of modernism
and the epic tradition.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.733
And obviously, we've read enough
of As I Lay Dying to

00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:05.300
know that this is in many
ways an epic journey.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.267
It is a journey, very heroic or
mock-heroic journey to bury

00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:15.167
Addie, so it has all the
trappings of the epic.

00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:18.833
It's an epic journey
on a small scale.

00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:26.000
And it's also taking advantage
of two epic conventions.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.367
We've seen just now that we hear
the voice of the dead,

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:35.200
and that's a very important epic
convention both in Homer

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.733
and in Dante.

00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:41.033
And as we'll see, it is also a
very important convention in

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:43.433
As I Lay Dying as well, that
Faulkner is making very

00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:45.800
liberal use of.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.367
The other interesting epic
convention that I think is

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:52.733
being invoked in As I Lay
Dying is the uncertain

00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:56.533
boundaries between the human
and the non-human.

00:01:56.533 --> 00:02:00.533
And we have already actually
seen a little bit of that, so

00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:03.333
I just wanted to refresh your
memory with something that we

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.500
discussed last time in
terms of there are

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.900
two kinds of speech.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.367
Last week, we talked about the
social dialect on one hand,

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:13.900
and then on the other hand
the words with secrets.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.633
And this is one instance
of words with

00:02:16.633 --> 00:02:20.100
secrets coming from Vardaman.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.033
So this is Vardaman talking
about something in the barn

00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:29.167
after he has beaten Peabody's
horses and broken the stick.

00:02:29.167 --> 00:02:33.567
"It is as though the dark were
resolving him out of his

00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:38.400
integrity into an unrelated
scattering of components--

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.600
snuffings and stamping, smells
of cooling flesh and ammoniac

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.033
hair, an illusion of a
coordinated whole of splotched

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:53.200
hide and strong bones within
which, drenched and secret and

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.500
familiar, an is different
from my is."

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.533
Most likely, Vardaman is talking
about the horse, but

00:03:04.533 --> 00:03:08.367
as we can see, especially as
we get closer to the end of

00:03:08.367 --> 00:03:13.033
that passage, this being that
is "drenched and secret and

00:03:13.033 --> 00:03:18.167
familiar, an is different from
my is," Vardaman seems to be

00:03:18.167 --> 00:03:21.400
talking really more about his
brother, Jewel, than about

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.233
Jewel's horse.

00:03:23.233 --> 00:03:27.700
And it's really hard to say when
the human ends and when

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.167
the animal begins in that
particular passage.

00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:36.767
So this is something that we
see both in a small moment

00:03:36.767 --> 00:03:40.733
like this in As I Lay Dying but
also in a very dramatized

00:03:40.733 --> 00:03:45.133
moment when Vardaman says, "My
mother is a fish," where

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:48.467
obviously a strong analogy is
being established between

00:03:48.467 --> 00:03:50.033
human and non-human.

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:53.567
We'll come back to that
statement on Thursday, but

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:58.433
today I'd like just to go back
a little bit and give you a

00:03:58.433 --> 00:04:02.400
sense of this very long epic
tradition behind As I Lay

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.233
Dying by going back to
Homer and Dante.

00:04:06.233 --> 00:04:10.300
And in Homer, I want to talk
about two instances: the

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:18.033
cyclops, obviously, we don't
know if he's fully human; and

00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:20.367
an even more famous
episode is Circe

00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:22.400
turning humans into animals.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.500
And then Dante following through
with that convention

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.433
in the Inferno when humans are
turned into animals as

00:04:29.433 --> 00:04:30.367
punishment.

00:04:30.367 --> 00:04:35.300
So first of all, Homer in
Book IX of The Odyssey.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.033
Odysseus and his men are trapped
inside a cage by the

00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:43.233
cyclops, and the way that they
try to escape is by blinding

00:04:43.233 --> 00:04:45.500
the cyclops, Polyphemus.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.900
And so this is a moment that
is reproduced by just about

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.833
all the painters who paint that
scene, that episode in

00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:55.933
The Odyssey, is the blinding
of the eye.

00:04:55.933 --> 00:04:59.133
And we know that the cyclops
only has one eyes, so it's

00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:00.400
relatively easy.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.633
You only have to do it once.

00:05:02.633 --> 00:05:07.667
So here's Odysseus blinding
the eye of the cyclops.

00:05:07.667 --> 00:05:11.200
And we can see that the
cyclops seems bigger.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.033
The main difference seems to be
in size and also the amount

00:05:14.033 --> 00:05:16.000
of hair on him.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.533
But otherwise, he has
a human form.

00:05:19.533 --> 00:05:21.600
But we also know that he's
different, if only because he

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.667
has one eye in the center
of his forehead.

00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:30.967
So he's not quite human, but
he's close enough, and that is

00:05:30.967 --> 00:05:36.300
a condition that is especially
fascinating to epic authors.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.233
Just give you a couple more
images of the cyclops.

00:05:39.233 --> 00:05:42.733
Basically, it's the
same kind of idea.

00:05:42.733 --> 00:05:46.367
He's much larger, has a lot more
hair, but otherwise has a

00:05:46.367 --> 00:05:49.933
recognizable human form.

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:55.033
All the men trying to use that
spike to blind the cyclops.

00:05:55.033 --> 00:05:57.733
And here is one more image.

00:05:57.733 --> 00:06:01.567
So pretty much, there seems to
be a consensus in thinking

00:06:01.567 --> 00:06:05.067
about the cyclops that he really
basically is like us.

00:06:05.067 --> 00:06:08.267
But what is also interesting is
that after his eye has been

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:14.600
blinded, the cyclops wants to
make sure that when his sheep

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.833
leave the cage that there
wouldn't be humans hiding or

00:06:18.833 --> 00:06:19.700
going along with them.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.633
So he's counting all his sheep
as they go out, as they leave

00:06:24.633 --> 00:06:27.667
his cave, even though he
can't really see them.

00:06:27.667 --> 00:06:31.767
And he's surprised that his
favorite sheep is the last to

00:06:31.767 --> 00:06:34.433
go, and he's the last to
go because Odysseus

00:06:34.433 --> 00:06:35.267
is clinging to him.

00:06:35.267 --> 00:06:37.833
But this is what cyclops
says to his sheep.

00:06:37.833 --> 00:06:41.767
"Sweet cousin ram, why
lag behind the rest

00:06:41.767 --> 00:06:43.600
in the night cave?

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.200
You never linger so but graze
before them all, and go afar

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.333
to crop sweet grass, and take
your stately way leading along

00:06:52.333 --> 00:06:56.033
the streams, until at evening
you come to be the first one

00:06:56.033 --> 00:06:57.667
in the fold.

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:00.067
Why, now, so far behind?

00:07:00.067 --> 00:07:04.467
Can you be grieving over
your Master's eye?"

00:07:04.467 --> 00:07:13.167
So not only is there a sense of
kinship between the cyclops

00:07:13.167 --> 00:07:19.100
and his sheep, but this is one
of the earliest moments of

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:24.433
cross-species identification
that the cyclops obviously is

00:07:24.433 --> 00:07:29.167
mourning the loss of his eye,
and he's imagining, he's

00:07:29.167 --> 00:07:36.367
projecting that grief onto his
sheep and recreating kinship

00:07:36.367 --> 00:07:37.200
on a different level.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.067
Not just on a physical level
there's a connection between

00:07:40.067 --> 00:07:43.267
humans and animals, but also
on the psychic level, on an

00:07:43.267 --> 00:07:46.533
emotional level, there is
that kind of kinship.

00:07:46.533 --> 00:07:49.933
So The Odyssey, I would say, is
one of the earliest moments

00:07:49.933 --> 00:07:53.933
of a really interesting
cross-species imagination, at

00:07:53.933 --> 00:07:56.267
least in this one moment.

00:07:56.267 --> 00:08:00.067
So the better known moment--
and actually I would argue

00:08:00.067 --> 00:08:02.600
it's less subtle than this--
is the transformation of

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.300
humans by Circe.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.533
And here's Odysseus going after
her because she has

00:08:07.533 --> 00:08:11.233
transformed one of his
men into this animal.

00:08:11.233 --> 00:08:13.900
So we see many instances
of this.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:21.100
And this is an amazing image,
this vessel with all the

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.333
animals in Circe's house.

00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:25.967
And I think that we recognize
that actually there's a strong

00:08:25.967 --> 00:08:28.000
Egyptian influence.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.733
These images look very Egyptian,
and there is in fact

00:08:30.733 --> 00:08:34.367
constant traffic between ancient
Greece and Egypt.

00:08:34.367 --> 00:08:38.833
So it's part of the impetus for
thinking about humans and

00:08:38.833 --> 00:08:42.767
non-humans as coming
from Egypt as well.

00:08:42.767 --> 00:08:45.467
And just to complete our
discussion of the epic

00:08:45.467 --> 00:08:47.967
tradition, Dante's doing
the same thing.

00:08:47.967 --> 00:08:49.800
And I just wanted to
alert you that the

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.400
snake is very important.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.667
The connection between the human
and the non-human in the

00:08:55.667 --> 00:09:02.533
Inferno is that Dante's basic
punitive philosophy is that

00:09:02.533 --> 00:09:07.233
humans get punished by being
changed into something that

00:09:07.233 --> 00:09:09.200
resembles the crime.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.833
So thieves, because they're
sneaky and they snake their

00:09:12.833 --> 00:09:17.267
way into other people's
dwellings and take what

00:09:17.267 --> 00:09:20.833
belongs to them, that thieves
are turned into

00:09:20.833 --> 00:09:23.000
snakes in the Inferno.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.933
So lots of snakes
in the Inferno.

00:09:25.933 --> 00:09:28.600
And one more dramatic
presentation.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.700
All of these are by William
Blake, so we have a really

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.133
interesting conjunction of a
nineteenth-century author

00:09:36.133 --> 00:09:39.067
going back to Dante and
reproducing these very

00:09:39.067 --> 00:09:42.233
emblematic moments.

00:09:42.233 --> 00:09:44.700
So we have on record a
nineteenth-century author,

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.900
William Blake, being inspired
by the epic tradition.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:54.000
And I think that Faulkner is a
twentieth-century instance of

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.233
a similar kind of inspiration.

00:09:56.233 --> 00:10:03.667
But as with Faulkner, he adds
another layer of complexity to

00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:05.100
the epic tradition.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.767
And I would say that this is
actually one of the most

00:10:07.767 --> 00:10:13.200
important innovations in As I
Lay Dying, in many ways more

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.600
interesting than the epic
journey itself, is that humans

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:21.467
are rarely identified with
just one kind of animal.

00:10:21.467 --> 00:10:24.267
More often, they are
pulled between

00:10:24.267 --> 00:10:27.567
two ends of a spectrum.

00:10:27.567 --> 00:10:30.967
They are sometimes identified
with one and sometimes

00:10:30.967 --> 00:10:32.067
identified with the other.

00:10:32.067 --> 00:10:34.600
And sometimes it's a
mixture of the two.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.100
So the two characters that I
would like to talk about in

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:45.667
that context is first of all
Tull and then Jewel.

00:10:45.667 --> 00:10:49.267
Tull is a minor character, but
in many ways he's a really

00:10:49.267 --> 00:10:55.900
good example to concentrate on
to try to get a sense of the

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.233
basic narrative strategies
in Faulkner.

00:10:59.233 --> 00:11:03.867
So I would just like to stop
here for a moment and talk

00:11:03.867 --> 00:11:09.300
about possible paper topics when
you think of the upcoming

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.833
long paper is to focus
on minor characters.

00:11:13.833 --> 00:11:19.967
It is counterintuitive to use
minor characters as the main

00:11:19.967 --> 00:11:23.433
subject of your papers, but
actually I promise you,

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:25.900
especially in the case of
Faulkner, you can get

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:31.500
wonderful papers by focusing on
someone like Tull or even

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:36.500
someone like Cora, a very
unobvious entry point.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.833
But because they are unobvious
entry points, you can actually

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:42.267
end up writing really
interesting and surprising and

00:11:42.267 --> 00:11:44.067
compelling papers.

00:11:44.067 --> 00:11:47.133
So I'll try to give you a
demonstration today of what

00:11:47.133 --> 00:11:51.000
could be done by focusing on a
minor character like Tull and

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.167
then obviously moving on to a
more central character, Jewel.

00:11:55.167 --> 00:11:59.900
So I would like to argue that
Tull is basically identified

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.400
with two opposing
kinds of animal.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.767
One is the mule, the
indispensable animal among

00:12:08.767 --> 00:12:13.833
poor whites, the mule rather
than the horse, and then a

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:17.100
creature that also makes
a routine appearance in

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.800
Faulkner, the buzzard.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:24.733
So first of all, the mule
and Tull as mule-like.

00:12:24.733 --> 00:12:29.000
"When I looked back at my mule,
it was like he was one

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.900
of these spy-glasses, and I
could look at him standing

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:38.000
there and see all the broad land
and my house sweated out

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.367
of it like it was the more the
sweat, the broader the land.

00:12:43.367 --> 00:12:46.800
The more the sweat, the
tighter the house.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.600
Because it would take a tight
house for Cora, to hold Cora

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.333
like a jar of milk
in the spring.

00:12:54.333 --> 00:12:56.300
You've got to have a
tight jar, or you

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.900
need a power spring.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.200
So if you have a big spring,
why then, you have the

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.733
incentive to have tight,
well-made jars.

00:13:04.733 --> 00:13:08.000
Because it is your milk,
sour or not.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.200
Because you would rather have
milk that will sour than to

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.033
have milk that won't, because
you are a man."

00:13:16.033 --> 00:13:20.467
I have no idea what he's
talking about.

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:22.167
This is really--

00:13:22.167 --> 00:13:24.833
I think maybe it's just the
sound of it that Faulkner

00:13:24.833 --> 00:13:29.567
wants us to get the flavor of
thoughts that might have been

00:13:29.567 --> 00:13:31.533
coursing through Tull's head.

00:13:31.533 --> 00:13:35.933
It's just a wonderful moment
talking about manhood among

00:13:35.933 --> 00:13:42.033
poor whites, people who don't
have a lot to prove their

00:13:42.033 --> 00:13:48.200
manhood with, no flask, no cars,
no iPhones, nothing.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:54.233
So very poor equipment with
which to prove your manhood.

00:13:54.233 --> 00:14:01.733
And the only thing that Tull
can use is just his mule.

00:14:01.733 --> 00:14:04.067
And so he's looking
at his mule.

00:14:04.067 --> 00:14:08.967
And by looking at his mule,
somehow his thoughts meander

00:14:08.967 --> 00:14:13.400
to the most important person in
his life, his wife, Cora.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.733
And that is his claim to Cora.

00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:24.867
So I won't be able to tell you
the exact logic behind this

00:14:24.867 --> 00:14:29.100
little bit of reasoning, which
is really more emotional

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.233
reasoning than cerebral
reasoning.

00:14:32.233 --> 00:14:36.000
But it seems that Tull is saying
that his claim to Cora,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.233
the way that he can keep her,
keep her in a tight house,

00:14:40.233 --> 00:14:44.700
both in the physical house but
also in a tight place in his

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:50.533
heart and in her heart, is by
being a very good laborer, by

00:14:50.533 --> 00:14:57.567
sweating and cultivating the
land and making sure that the

00:14:57.567 --> 00:15:02.100
more the sweat, the
tighter the house.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:08.400
So this is the logic, that this
is the nature of manhood

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:13.433
among poor whites is that it is
by the sweat of your brow

00:15:13.433 --> 00:15:16.600
that you can win the
woman's heart.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.133
It's nothing fancy, nothing

00:15:19.133 --> 00:15:21.600
complicated, very simple logic.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.100
But of course, it doesn't
come out in a

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.967
simple way in Faulkner.

00:15:26.967 --> 00:15:33.833
And that really is the defining
nature of existence

00:15:33.833 --> 00:15:38.267
of very poor, rural people is
that basically you only have

00:15:38.267 --> 00:15:41.533
one thing to prove yourself.

00:15:41.533 --> 00:15:44.967
And we can see that why on this
one thing Anse is such an

00:15:44.967 --> 00:15:48.133
inadequate specimen
of masculinity.

00:15:48.133 --> 00:15:50.933
He's just not a very
good workman.

00:15:50.933 --> 00:15:54.867
So Tull is by contrast someone
who is fully adequate, fully

00:15:54.867 --> 00:15:59.433
competent, fully impressive
specimen of manhood in that

00:15:59.433 --> 00:16:01.933
particular environment.

00:16:01.933 --> 00:16:03.167
And he's very proud.

00:16:03.167 --> 00:16:04.833
This is a very joyful moment.

00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:08.200
This is one of the great
scenes about marriage.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.500
And on Thursday, we'll talk
about a contrasting scene of a

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:16.067
very bad marriage, contrasting
with this very happy scene of

00:16:16.067 --> 00:16:19.100
a married couple in Faulkner.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:26.233
But as with Faulkner, mules
don't stay happy forever, or

00:16:26.233 --> 00:16:30.733
humans that are like mules
don't stay happy forever.

00:16:30.733 --> 00:16:36.200
So we are turning to a different
meaning of the mules

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:43.100
when the journey takes both an
epic but also a tragic turn

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.633
when they try to cross the river
when the bridge is gone.

00:16:47.633 --> 00:16:52.933
And the mules are supposed to
pull the cart across the

00:16:52.933 --> 00:16:55.733
river, which they know they
cannot do, so they're just

00:16:55.733 --> 00:16:59.767
looking at this impending
disaster.

00:16:59.767 --> 00:17:04.300
And once again, the mules as
emblematic of people who know

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.167
that something terrible is
going to happen but with

00:17:07.167 --> 00:17:11.167
absolutely no power to stop
that from happening.

00:17:11.167 --> 00:17:14.700
"The mules stand, their
forequarters already sloped a

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.433
little, their rumps high.

00:17:17.433 --> 00:17:22.167
They too are breathing now with
a deep groaning sound.

00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:26.433
Looking back once, their gaze
sweeps across us, within their

00:17:26.433 --> 00:17:32.033
eyes a wild, sad, profound,
and despairing quality, as

00:17:32.033 --> 00:17:35.667
though they had already seen in
the thick water the shape

00:17:35.667 --> 00:17:39.600
of the disaster which they could
not speak and we could

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.100
not see."

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:45.833
So I think the epic convention
is-- in fact, the entire

00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:50.200
ancient Greek tradition is
invoked in two ways, both in

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:55.933
the mules as in many ways
emblematic of humans but also

00:17:55.933 --> 00:17:58.633
in the function of
a tragic chorus.

00:17:58.633 --> 00:18:01.233
We know that this is a
structural feature in Greek

00:18:01.233 --> 00:18:06.067
tragedy, a chorus looking on
knowing that a catastrophe is

00:18:06.067 --> 00:18:09.200
about to hit but with absolutely
no ability to

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.467
prevent its coming.

00:18:10.467 --> 00:18:13.033
So that's what the mules
are doing here.

00:18:13.033 --> 00:18:15.667
That's the function, that's the
epic function within As I

00:18:15.667 --> 00:18:21.400
Lay Dying, very much associated
with a resigned but

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:27.933
resilient attitude that we've
seen in Tull, but in this

00:18:27.933 --> 00:18:33.067
case, the resignation and the
personal bravery, that those

00:18:33.067 --> 00:18:38.000
two qualities aren't really
adequate to stopping the

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.200
arrival of a catastrophe.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:47.433
So in the next moment, we see
what happens to the mules.

00:18:47.433 --> 00:18:53.433
And this is in many ways simply
a logical conclusion of

00:18:53.433 --> 00:18:56.567
what they have already
been aware of.

00:18:56.567 --> 00:19:01.300
This is a completely
unsurprising ending to this

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:06.467
sequence begun by the mules
as the tragic chorus.

00:19:06.467 --> 00:19:10.933
"Between two hills, I see
the mules once more.

00:19:10.933 --> 00:19:14.867
They roll up out of the water
in succession, turning

00:19:14.867 --> 00:19:20.300
completely over, their legs
stiffly extended, as when they

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:24.367
had lost contact with
the earth."

00:19:24.367 --> 00:19:31.600
So this is in many ways a
backward gesture to that

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:38.467
earlier happy moment when the
mules are fully contented and

00:19:38.467 --> 00:19:43.500
fully capable of doing what they
can do within their own

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.167
environment.

00:19:45.167 --> 00:19:48.867
Mules are creatures
with feet of clay.

00:19:48.867 --> 00:19:53.267
That's what's clear in this
kind of sequence is that

00:19:53.267 --> 00:19:57.233
because they are creatures with
feet of clay, they can

00:19:57.233 --> 00:20:01.500
only survive when they
are on solid earth.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.767
And when they're on solid earth,
they are very good in

00:20:04.767 --> 00:20:09.300
making that earth productive
and reproductive.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.000
So this is really what Tull
is talking about.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.167
He's a very productive farmer.

00:20:14.167 --> 00:20:20.000
He's also reproductively
happy with Cora.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.400
That is the nature but also
the limits of a mule-like

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.000
existence is that there's
certain lines that mules

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.033
cannot cross.

00:20:31.033 --> 00:20:34.267
They cannot transcend
their own condition.

00:20:34.267 --> 00:20:40.867
As creatures with feet of clay,
they can only be OK--

00:20:40.867 --> 00:20:44.267
and it really is no more than
that-- they can be OK only

00:20:44.267 --> 00:20:46.067
within one setting.

00:20:46.067 --> 00:20:52.767
And in this other moment, when
they left the customary

00:20:52.767 --> 00:20:56.433
setting and they are stuck
trying to negotiate with a

00:20:56.433 --> 00:21:00.667
swollen river, we know that the
mules will not survive in

00:21:00.667 --> 00:21:02.500
that kind of transformed
setting.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:06.233
So in many ways, a perfect
analogy for the poor whites,

00:21:06.233 --> 00:21:10.567
that they can do relatively
well when they're left to

00:21:10.567 --> 00:21:13.100
their own devices, when they're
allowed simply to

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.333
stick to their environment.

00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:17.133
But once they're taken out of
their environment, then we

00:21:17.133 --> 00:21:20.200
know that terrible things are
going to happen to them.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.800
So in this particular
sequence, Tull being

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:29.067
associated with the mules, he's
basically defenseless.

00:21:29.067 --> 00:21:33.433
He wants just to be allowed
to live life

00:21:33.433 --> 00:21:35.800
according to his own fashion.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.267
That really is the basic
requirement of the mules is to

00:21:39.267 --> 00:21:44.200
be let alone and to be allowed
just to survive as

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.367
they know how to do.

00:21:46.367 --> 00:21:52.333
That is a very innocuous and
in many ways a very sad

00:21:52.333 --> 00:21:55.500
portrait of the poor whites
but basically innocuous.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:00.900
But Faulkner really also has a
somewhat different image of

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:04.600
what the poor white community
might amount to.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.800
And so he's not just going to
give us an image of poor

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.067
whites as defenseless but
basically non-aggressive.

00:22:12.067 --> 00:22:15.233
Mules are completely
non-aggressive.

00:22:15.233 --> 00:22:20.033
Faulkner does think that there
actually is an element of

00:22:20.033 --> 00:22:23.733
aggression in a very close-knit
community,

00:22:23.733 --> 00:22:26.500
especially a close-knit
community such as the poor

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.600
white community.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:32.367
And we see that in the next
image of the poor whites

00:22:32.367 --> 00:22:35.367
coming not surprisingly
from Jewel.

00:22:35.367 --> 00:22:39.167
This is how Jewel thinks
about his neighbors.

00:22:39.167 --> 00:22:43.667
"And now them others, sitting
there, like buzzards.

00:22:43.667 --> 00:22:48.600
Waiting, fanning themselves,
every bastard in the country

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.167
coming in to stare at her."

00:22:52.167 --> 00:22:57.267
We've talked about hatred as a
very important emotion, as a

00:22:57.267 --> 00:23:00.767
kind of emotional bond
within the family.

00:23:00.767 --> 00:23:04.700
And we now see that hatred
is also a very important

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:10.867
emotional bond within a small,
isolated community.

00:23:10.867 --> 00:23:14.667
Not only does Jewel hate someone
like Tull, because

00:23:14.667 --> 00:23:17.133
they're always sitting there
watching your every move, not

00:23:17.133 --> 00:23:22.833
only does Jewel hate Tull, but
he also imagines that there is

00:23:22.833 --> 00:23:26.533
an element of aggression,
something that is not quite

00:23:26.533 --> 00:23:29.200
benign coming from
the neighbors.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:34.500
And that is really why he's so
suspicious of them and so

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.100
ill-disposed towards
them on his part.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:42.067
And the buzzards actually will
appear over and over again.

00:23:42.067 --> 00:23:46.767
We've already seen them in The
Sound and the Fury, the

00:23:46.767 --> 00:23:51.433
buzzards collecting around the
body of the dog, Nancy, in the

00:23:51.433 --> 00:23:56.600
ditch and buzzards that Benjy
imagines would go and undress

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.733
his dead grandmother.

00:23:57.733 --> 00:24:01.100
So buzzards have already
appeared in Faulkner.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.433
But in As I Lay Dying, buzzards
as a physical

00:24:04.433 --> 00:24:07.000
presence will be quite
important.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.600
And also as a metaphoric
presence to talk about what

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.233
your neighbors might really
be like in their hearts--

00:24:15.233 --> 00:24:18.500
not in their outward behavior,
but in their hearts, they

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.600
might be just like buzzards.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:25.567
And here's an image of buzzards
to explain why Jewel

00:24:25.567 --> 00:24:29.367
might think that the neighbors
are like them.

00:24:29.367 --> 00:24:34.467
So Tull, as I said, is obviously
not the main

00:24:34.467 --> 00:24:37.233
protagonist in As I Lay Dying.

00:24:37.233 --> 00:24:43.833
But he is an important clue to
what Faulkner is trying to do.

00:24:43.833 --> 00:24:47.333
Because the way Faulkner
portrays Jewel, a very

00:24:47.333 --> 00:24:52.733
important character, is almost
exactly analogous to the way

00:24:52.733 --> 00:24:59.100
he portrays Tull, except that
what in Tull is dispersed and

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.500
sequenced--

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:05.367
Tull is sometimes identified
with the mule and sometimes

00:25:05.367 --> 00:25:06.833
identified with the buzzard.

00:25:06.833 --> 00:25:10.233
We don't actually see him
being simultaneously

00:25:10.233 --> 00:25:12.600
identified with both.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:18.700
What is sequenced and spaced out
in Tull would quite often

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:23.733
be collapsed together
as one in Faulkner's

00:25:23.733 --> 00:25:25.033
portrayal of Jewel.

00:25:25.033 --> 00:25:31.033
So in this moment, we actually
see Jewel being likened to two

00:25:31.033 --> 00:25:34.867
animals, not just one, not
just his horse, which is

00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:39.233
obviously the main creature that
he's affiliated with, not

00:25:39.233 --> 00:25:42.200
just the horse, but
something else.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.367
"'Come here, sir,' Jewel says.

00:25:44.367 --> 00:25:45.867
He moves.

00:25:45.867 --> 00:25:49.733
Moving that quick, his coat,
bunching, tongue swirling like

00:25:49.733 --> 00:25:51.267
so many flames.

00:25:51.267 --> 00:25:55.533
With tossing mane and tall and
rolling eye, the horse makes

00:25:55.533 --> 00:26:00.700
another short curvetting rush
and stops again, feet bunched,

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.100
watching Jewel.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:07.000
Jewel walks steadily toward him,
his hands at his sides.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.333
Save for Jewel's legs, they are
like figures carved for a

00:26:11.333 --> 00:26:14.567
tableau savage in the sun.

00:26:14.567 --> 00:26:17.733
"When Jewel can almost touch
him, the horse stands on its

00:26:17.733 --> 00:26:21.167
hind legs and slashes
maze of hooves as by

00:26:21.167 --> 00:26:22.567
an illusion of wings.

00:26:22.567 --> 00:26:26.233
Among them, beneath the upreared
chest, he moves with

00:26:26.233 --> 00:26:29.700
the flashing limberness
of a snake.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:33.100
For an instant, before the jerk
comes into his arms, he

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:37.667
sees his whole body, earth-free,
horizontal,

00:26:37.667 --> 00:26:42.567
whipping snake-limber, until he
finds the horse's nostrils

00:26:42.567 --> 00:26:45.567
and touches earth again."

00:26:45.567 --> 00:26:48.500
So many things to say
about this moment.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:49.400
The first--

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.233
and we've referenced back to
the mules and the fact that

00:26:52.233 --> 00:26:53.967
they are creatures of clay--

00:26:53.967 --> 00:26:57.767
is that Faulkner is basically
making a very deep, metaphoric

00:26:57.767 --> 00:27:00.700
distinction between two
kinds of animals.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.833
There are animals like the
mules, who can't swim and can

00:27:03.833 --> 00:27:08.533
only survive when they are on
solid earth, and then there

00:27:08.533 --> 00:27:12.467
are other creatures, the horse
being the main example, who

00:27:12.467 --> 00:27:17.333
actually can leave the earth
for a nontrivial length of

00:27:17.333 --> 00:27:20.300
time and be able to survive
when they're not

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.767
touching the earth.

00:27:21.767 --> 00:27:26.333
So right here, we know that
Jewel is a very different kind

00:27:26.333 --> 00:27:28.300
of person from Tull.

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:32.800
Yes, he is in a poor
white community.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.400
His parents appear to
be poor whites.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.900
But for some reason, there is
something else about Jewel

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:41.200
that makes him different.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.900
He's more horse-like
than mule-like.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:49.267
So this is a backward reference
to another important

00:27:49.267 --> 00:27:50.967
animal in As I Lay Dying.

00:27:50.967 --> 00:27:56.133
But within the compass of this
particular passage, what is

00:27:56.133 --> 00:28:01.967
really interesting is the
simultaneous co-presence of

00:28:01.967 --> 00:28:04.433
the horse and the snake.

00:28:04.433 --> 00:28:08.767
And for most of us, the two of
them actually really are not

00:28:08.767 --> 00:28:10.067
that alike.

00:28:10.067 --> 00:28:14.700
It's hard to think of any kind
of kinship, really, between

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.300
the horse and the snake.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.900
They look different, and they
have very different

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:24.000
connotations in our common
understanding

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.667
of those two animals.

00:28:25.667 --> 00:28:32.633
So let's try to see what it is
that enables Faulkner to bring

00:28:32.633 --> 00:28:34.067
those two animals together.

00:28:34.067 --> 00:28:37.200
Well, we know that the horse is
a winged horse, so this is

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.133
going back to the
epic tradition.

00:28:39.133 --> 00:28:40.200
It's an illusion of wings.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:45.000
This is not just a horse that
is an earthly creature, but

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.800
seemingly one of the winged
horses of Greek mythology.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.900
And certainly the horse is
acting like a mythic horse, in

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:59.233
that the motion is almost
beyond just the physical

00:28:59.233 --> 00:29:02.133
capability of any earthly
creature.

00:29:02.133 --> 00:29:08.567
So it is the body in motion,
but not being registered as

00:29:08.567 --> 00:29:14.967
body at all, but simply as
bodily parts coming into view,

00:29:14.967 --> 00:29:18.267
when suddenly you are seeing
that bodily part, but not

00:29:18.267 --> 00:29:20.233
really the entire horse.

00:29:20.233 --> 00:29:23.400
And that actually was the way
that Vardaman was thinking of

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.133
the horse as well.

00:29:25.133 --> 00:29:29.467
We'll go back to that moment.

00:29:29.467 --> 00:29:34.700
In Vardaman's representation of
the horse in the barn, "It

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:38.700
was as though the dark were
resolving him out of his

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:44.333
integrity into an unrelated
scattering of components--

00:29:44.333 --> 00:29:48.033
snuffings and stampings, smells
of cooling flesh and

00:29:48.033 --> 00:29:50.400
ammoniac hair," and so on.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.433
So Vardaman has exactly the
same kind of scattered

00:29:54.433 --> 00:29:56.067
representation.

00:29:56.067 --> 00:29:59.000
The horse is moving so fast that
we're not actually seeing

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.333
the horse as a single,
integrated being, but simply

00:30:04.333 --> 00:30:07.367
as different bodily
parts coming into

00:30:07.367 --> 00:30:09.267
view through the motion.

00:30:09.267 --> 00:30:12.567
So really it's less about the
body, less about the horse's

00:30:12.567 --> 00:30:15.533
body, than about a
very fast, almost

00:30:15.533 --> 00:30:18.033
transcendent kind of motion.

00:30:18.033 --> 00:30:24.000
And that is really how Jewel's
horse is represented to us.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.267
We don't see him as a horse.

00:30:25.267 --> 00:30:30.000
We simply see him as something
that is in constant motion.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.533
But more than that, it is the
very ambiguous relation

00:30:35.533 --> 00:30:39.467
between Jewel and the horse.

00:30:39.467 --> 00:30:42.133
Obviously, Jewel loves
his horse.

00:30:42.133 --> 00:30:46.733
He's done a lot of work
to get the horse.

00:30:46.733 --> 00:30:49.800
It is very much his horse.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:55.400
But it is not exactly an
affectionate relation.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:00.933
It is a battle between two
creatures very important to

00:31:00.933 --> 00:31:02.267
each other.

00:31:02.267 --> 00:31:06.700
The horse probably is the most
important creature to Jewel,

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.933
but there's no affection
there.

00:31:08.933 --> 00:31:10.733
So what is the feeling?

00:31:10.733 --> 00:31:15.833
What is the emotional bond
between these two things if it

00:31:15.833 --> 00:31:21.400
is not common affection, which
is the most ordinary and

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:25.367
easily recognizable and
recognized human bond?

00:31:25.367 --> 00:31:26.567
It's not there.

00:31:26.567 --> 00:31:30.067
What is this other emotion
that is there?

00:31:30.067 --> 00:31:33.800
And it seems that what Faulkner
is suggesting is that

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:39.600
instead of the common human
affection, it is a snake-like

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:45.300
quality that is binding
Jewel to his horse.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:50.033
We don't know what emotions
snakes have. They're not

00:31:50.033 --> 00:31:53.600
credited with having emotions,
other than sneakiness, which

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.733
isn't really an emotion.

00:31:55.733 --> 00:32:02.200
So we don't actually know what
kind of emotional bonds can

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.200
come from snakes, aggression
or maybe some degree of

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:09.667
hatred, but that is
a general thing.

00:32:09.667 --> 00:32:12.867
It's not a benign feeling,
that's for sure.

00:32:12.867 --> 00:32:17.300
So right now, let's just say
that we don't completely

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:22.733
understand what is going on
here or why the snake is a

00:32:22.733 --> 00:32:26.000
very important supplement
to the relation between

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.733
Jewel and the horse.

00:32:27.733 --> 00:32:31.133
We're back, once again, to what
we've been talking about

00:32:31.133 --> 00:32:33.667
earlier, which is the
narrative as a

00:32:33.667 --> 00:32:36.533
secret-bearing narrative.

00:32:36.533 --> 00:32:38.600
This is not social dialect.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.133
This is words with secrets.

00:32:40.133 --> 00:32:42.667
That's what we're seeing
right here.

00:32:42.667 --> 00:32:47.933
And just to highlight how
unusual this description of

00:32:47.933 --> 00:32:51.600
Jewel and the horse is, I just
want to go back very briefly

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:56.167
to a contrasting moment in
Hemingway, when once again we

00:32:56.167 --> 00:32:58.733
see a human paired with an
animal that is very important

00:32:58.733 --> 00:33:00.933
to him in In Our Time.

00:33:00.933 --> 00:33:03.867
This is the matador
killing the bull.

00:33:03.867 --> 00:33:07.600
"When he started to kill it, it
was all in the same rush.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.533
The bull looking at him straight
in front, hating.

00:33:11.533 --> 00:33:17.000
The bull charged and Villalta
charged and just for a moment

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.500
they became one.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:23.067
Villalta became one with the
bull and then it was over."

00:33:23.067 --> 00:33:28.100
In this passage in Hemingway,
actually, the emotion of

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.800
hatred is quite important
as well.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:37.367
So in an odd way, just like
Faulkner, Hemingway is also

00:33:37.367 --> 00:33:41.467
interested in hatred as a
powerful emotional bond.

00:33:41.467 --> 00:33:44.067
And that really is
what enables the

00:33:44.067 --> 00:33:45.667
bullfight to go on.

00:33:45.667 --> 00:33:53.500
But it is hatred so clear and
so transparent and so

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:59.433
ritualistic and so ceremonious
that it is also transformed by

00:33:59.433 --> 00:34:02.533
that ritual into a kind
of love, really.

00:34:02.533 --> 00:34:06.933
So in Hemingway, it is
very, very clear.

00:34:06.933 --> 00:34:09.700
It's the clarity of the
sentiment that is in the

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:10.267
foreground.

00:34:10.267 --> 00:34:11.900
There's really nothing
more to say.

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:15.000
The bull and the matador
have become one.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.167
Hemingway keeps repeating
that.

00:34:17.167 --> 00:34:21.800
Everything is completely clear,
and there is no secret

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.900
whatsoever.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:29.333
By contrast, this is a secretive
narrative that

00:34:29.333 --> 00:34:31.867
flaunts its secret
in our face.

00:34:31.867 --> 00:34:34.067
We don't really understand
what's going on.

00:34:34.067 --> 00:34:37.433
And that is the purpose of
this kind of narration --

00:34:37.433 --> 00:34:41.200
so just to refresh your
memory, we're drawing

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.100
inspiration from
Frank Kermode's

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:47.267
classic, Genesis of Secrecy.

00:34:47.267 --> 00:34:54.733
And the moment when Faulkner is
highlighting, dramatizing

00:34:54.733 --> 00:35:01.000
the existence of a secret is
by way of Jewel's horse.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.200
And this time it is a fully
dramatized moment, in the

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.833
sense that not only is the horse
there and not only is

00:35:08.833 --> 00:35:11.133
Jewel there, but everyone
else is there.

00:35:11.133 --> 00:35:13.567
So there's the entire
tragic chorus--

00:35:13.567 --> 00:35:16.533
or maybe in this case not
completely tragic either--

00:35:16.533 --> 00:35:19.367
but the entire chorus
is there witnessing

00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:20.967
this dramatic exchange.

00:35:20.967 --> 00:35:24.500
And it is no longer an exchange
between Jewel and the

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.667
horse, but someone else.

00:35:26.667 --> 00:35:29.700
"'Jewel,' ma said,
looking at him.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:30.933
'I'll give--

00:35:30.933 --> 00:35:32.100
I'll give--

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.600
give.' Then she began to cry.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.067
She cried hard, not hiding her
face, standing there in her

00:35:40.067 --> 00:35:44.333
faded wrapper, looking at him
and him on the horse looking

00:35:44.333 --> 00:35:49.400
down at her, his face growing
cold and a little sick-looking

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.967
until he looked away quick, and
Cash came and touched her.

00:35:53.967 --> 00:35:56.467
'You go on to the house,'
Cash said.

00:35:56.467 --> 00:35:58.733
'This here ground is
too wet for you.

00:35:58.733 --> 00:36:00.533
You go on, now.'

00:36:00.533 --> 00:36:04.400
"That night, I found ma sitting
beside the bed where

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.267
he was sleeping in the dark.

00:36:06.267 --> 00:36:11.100
She cried hard, maybe because
she had to cry so quiet, maybe

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.733
because she felt the same way
about tears as she did about

00:36:14.733 --> 00:36:20.433
deceit, hating herself for doing
it, hating him because

00:36:20.433 --> 00:36:22.000
she had to.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.267
And then I knew that I knew.

00:36:24.267 --> 00:36:30.433
I knew that as plain as on the
day I knew about Dewey Dell."

00:36:30.433 --> 00:36:36.367
So this is the moment when
the secret is exposed.

00:36:36.367 --> 00:36:43.033
And it is exposed of course
without Faulkner ever coming

00:36:43.033 --> 00:36:50.233
close to the very simple
nature of that secret.

00:36:50.233 --> 00:36:53.933
It is completely by
way of this detour

00:36:53.933 --> 00:36:56.200
around Jewel's horse.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:01.100
The way we know that there is
a secret is that Addie's

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:05.667
response to the horse is nothing
like what would have

00:37:05.667 --> 00:37:08.267
been a normal response
to a horse.

00:37:08.267 --> 00:37:11.567
Her son disappears night
after night.

00:37:11.567 --> 00:37:13.733
People don't know
where he goes.

00:37:13.733 --> 00:37:17.433
And then all of a sudden, he
comes back with this horse, an

00:37:17.433 --> 00:37:19.900
unheard of possession
among poor whites.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.700
Mules would be the standard
animals to

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:22.767
have for poor whites.

00:37:22.767 --> 00:37:27.100
A horse is not at all the thing
to have or that anyone

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:31.467
could have. So this is
a possession that is

00:37:31.467 --> 00:37:34.000
inappropriate for poor whites.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.033
And Vardaman's response is
what would've been an

00:37:38.033 --> 00:37:40.967
ordinary, completely
understandable response is,

00:37:40.967 --> 00:37:42.200
let me ride the horse.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:46.967
So Vardaman is reacting
as anyone would react.

00:37:46.967 --> 00:37:54.633
Addie's response is by crying,
which I guess could still have

00:37:54.633 --> 00:38:03.533
been normal, except that the
response then from Jewel is

00:38:03.533 --> 00:38:06.467
that his face is growing cold.

00:38:06.467 --> 00:38:11.700
And then he's looking at her,
and the more he looks at her,

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:15.433
the more sick-looking
he becomes.

00:38:15.433 --> 00:38:20.800
So that is not in the
script at all.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:29.633
If the horse had been anything
but a good event, if the horse

00:38:29.633 --> 00:38:33.600
had simply been a joyous
acquisition, none of this

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.400
would have happened.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:40.633
So what is it that transforms
a joyous acquisition into

00:38:40.633 --> 00:38:45.200
something that people can either
cry about or be very

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:50.167
uneasy about or something that
requires some degree of

00:38:50.167 --> 00:38:53.500
comforting, which is what
Cash seems to be doing?

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.967
Here is this proud mother.

00:38:55.967 --> 00:38:58.000
And Addie ought to be
a proud mother.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000
And instead, Cash is talking
to her as if something

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.867
terrible had happened to her.
"Go on back to the house.

00:39:05.867 --> 00:39:07.033
Go on, now.

00:39:07.033 --> 00:39:11.833
The ground is too wet for you."
The solicitude coming

00:39:11.833 --> 00:39:15.467
from Cash is also
inexplicable.

00:39:15.467 --> 00:39:18.533
So we can say that from
every single person--

00:39:18.533 --> 00:39:22.433
the overreaction of Addie, the
crying, the sick-looking

00:39:22.433 --> 00:39:26.700
expression on Jewel's face,
the over-solicitude coming

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.033
from Cash--

00:39:28.033 --> 00:39:31.267
all of those things are things
that should not be in the

00:39:31.267 --> 00:39:33.800
script but surprisingly
are in the script.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.900
And then we know that there
really is something that could

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:41.267
be named, that could be
identified and named.

00:39:41.267 --> 00:39:47.800
And even though Darl is not
going to name it for us, he

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:54.067
comes as close as he can
to saying that word.

00:39:54.067 --> 00:40:00.800
So the way he tells us is that,
"I knew that as plain on

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:07.100
that day as I knew about Dewey
Dell." So right here, we see a

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:10.767
backward reproduction in
terms of Faulkner's

00:40:10.767 --> 00:40:12.233
characterization.

00:40:12.233 --> 00:40:15.900
We know about Dewey Dell's
pregnancy out of wedlock

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:22.000
first, and this is the thing
that Darl knows about, this

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.267
transparent secret.

00:40:24.267 --> 00:40:29.867
It is Dewey Dell's
out-of-wedlock pregnancy that

00:40:29.867 --> 00:40:32.600
is being reproduced
in her mother.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:36.633
This is the interesting backward
reproduction, like

00:40:36.633 --> 00:40:39.467
mother, like daughter.

00:40:39.467 --> 00:40:42.867
And in this case, we know about
the daughter's condition

00:40:42.867 --> 00:40:46.667
first. And it's because Darl has
exactly the same reaction

00:40:46.667 --> 00:40:50.500
now and exactly the same degree
of knowledge now that

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:54.667
we know that in fact what Dewey
Dell is doing now has

00:40:54.667 --> 00:40:58.333
been done once before in the
family by her mother.

00:40:58.333 --> 00:41:02.633
So a lot of things are hanging
together, the fact that Jewel

00:41:02.633 --> 00:41:07.133
has a very different height,
that can't be explained.

00:41:07.133 --> 00:41:11.067
The fact that Jewel can acquire
a horse when nobody

00:41:11.067 --> 00:41:13.667
else in a poor white community,
that can't be

00:41:13.667 --> 00:41:14.533
explained as well.

00:41:14.533 --> 00:41:19.400
A lot of things are falling into
place with a suspicion

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.833
that's just sneaking up on us.

00:41:22.833 --> 00:41:26.733
And I think that this is really
why the snake is so

00:41:26.733 --> 00:41:31.133
important to Faulkner is
that a discovery is

00:41:31.133 --> 00:41:32.733
sneaking up on us.

00:41:32.733 --> 00:41:36.300
It is sneaking up on
everyone else.

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:42.100
This is a snake that is not
like the snake in Dante, a

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:46.300
snake that takes the possession
of someone else--

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:50.100
although there's an element of
this as well-- but a snake

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:54.633
that insinuates itself into our
consciousness and imparts

00:41:54.633 --> 00:42:00.200
to us a degree of knowledge or a
kind of knowledge that maybe

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.533
we would prefer not to have.
So this is really the very

00:42:03.533 --> 00:42:06.433
early snake, the snake that is
the bearer of knowledge coming

00:42:06.433 --> 00:42:10.933
to Adam and Eve that is
being invoked here.

00:42:10.933 --> 00:42:14.800
And just to clinch the case,
just to make everything very,

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:22.500
very clear, Faulkner now resorts
to another convention,

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:26.167
bringing Addie back to
life so that she

00:42:26.167 --> 00:42:28.100
actually gets to say something.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:34.333
And there is no other
explanation other than the

00:42:34.333 --> 00:42:40.333
poetic license afforded by the
epic form that would allow for

00:42:40.333 --> 00:42:44.933
a completely non-realistic
representation of the voice of

00:42:44.933 --> 00:42:48.667
a dead person in an otherwise
realistic novel.

00:42:48.667 --> 00:42:51.800
But that is the poetic license
that Faulkner is taking.

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.867
So in a very, very strange
moment, basically at the very

00:42:54.867 --> 00:42:58.200
heart of As I Lay Dying, we
see the voice of Addie

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.633
addressing us and talking
about a past

00:43:00.633 --> 00:43:03.567
moment in her life.

00:43:03.567 --> 00:43:06.767
"I would think of sin as I would
think of the clothes we

00:43:06.767 --> 00:43:11.433
both wore in the world's face,
of the circumspection

00:43:11.433 --> 00:43:17.433
necessary, because he was he and
I was I. The sin the more

00:43:17.433 --> 00:43:21.433
utter and terrible since he was
the instrument ordained by

00:43:21.433 --> 00:43:24.767
God who created the
sin to sanctify

00:43:24.767 --> 00:43:28.500
that sin he had created.

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:31.333
While I waited for him in the
woods, waiting for him because

00:43:31.333 --> 00:43:34.600
he saw me before he saw me,
I would think of him

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.300
as dressed in sin.

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:39.400
He the more beautiful, since
the garment which he had

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.967
exchanged for sin
was sanctified."

00:43:42.967 --> 00:43:51.467
It's a confession, I guess, as
close to a confession as we

00:43:51.467 --> 00:43:55.333
can get about the paternity
of Jewel.

00:43:55.333 --> 00:44:00.067
But that confession about the
paternity of Jewel is

00:44:00.067 --> 00:44:06.667
characteristically couched in
terms of a strange kind of

00:44:06.667 --> 00:44:13.033
satisfaction that Addie gets
from this particular kind of

00:44:13.033 --> 00:44:18.800
affair, which is that the
garment that her partner in

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:24.467
sin has exchanged for that sin
is actually all the more

00:44:24.467 --> 00:44:28.667
beautiful because it is
sanctified by God.

00:44:28.667 --> 00:44:32.700
So that tells us who
the father is.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:36.800
And Faulkner is being
tongue-in-cheek here.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.867
The father, we figure out,
is probably Whitfield.

00:44:39.867 --> 00:44:42.400
He's the only likely
candidate.

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.033
There's really no one else in
that small community who could

00:44:45.033 --> 00:44:46.000
be the father.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.800
So there could only be one.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:52.300
But it turns out that Faulkner
actually has taken his name

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:57.533
from a historic figure, a very
influential preacher,

00:44:57.533 --> 00:44:58.633
eighteenth-century preacher.

00:44:58.633 --> 00:45:02.200
Benjamin Franklin said that
when he would go to hear

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:05.033
Whitfield, he would make sure
that he would have very little

00:45:05.033 --> 00:45:07.633
money on his person, because
he just knew that he would

00:45:07.633 --> 00:45:12.400
empty out his pockets when
Whitfield goes around and asks

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.067
for donations.

00:45:13.067 --> 00:45:15.667
And sure enough, even though
he takes very little money

00:45:15.667 --> 00:45:18.267
with him, he always walks away
with empty pockets after

00:45:18.267 --> 00:45:18.867
Whitfield is done.

00:45:18.867 --> 00:45:23.100
So that's a very powerful, one
of the most famous preachers

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:24.833
of the 18th century.

00:45:24.833 --> 00:45:29.800
And Faulkner has recreated
this preacher, but with a

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.767
twist, in As I Lay Dying.

00:45:31.767 --> 00:45:33.667
This is his Whitfield.

00:45:33.667 --> 00:45:39.033
"It was His hand that bore me
safely above the flood, that

00:45:39.033 --> 00:45:42.133
fended me from the dangers
of the waters.

00:45:42.133 --> 00:45:46.367
My horse was frightened, and my
own heart failed me as the

00:45:46.367 --> 00:45:51.067
logs and the uprooted trees bore
down upon my littleness.

00:45:51.067 --> 00:45:53.100
But not my soul.

00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:56.033
I knew then that forgiveness
was mine.

00:45:56.033 --> 00:46:01.767
The flood, the danger, behind,
and as I rode on across the

00:46:01.767 --> 00:46:03.867
firm earth--"

00:46:03.867 --> 00:46:10.200
So the Bundrens aren't able to
cross the swollen river.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:14.100
The mules drown in the river.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:19.567
One person is able to cross the
river, because his horse

00:46:19.567 --> 00:46:23.200
is able to cross the river.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:30.500
So this is the genealogy of the
horse, both as a horse but

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:33.267
obviously also a
snake as well.

00:46:33.267 --> 00:46:40.100
The full spectrum of meanings
of the creature snake are

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:42.600
revealed to us in pieces.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:46.600
And that's really the nature
of the narrative, that we

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:49.567
don't actually get the whole
creature all at once.

00:46:49.567 --> 00:46:54.433
We see different bodily parts
come into view with the motion

00:46:54.433 --> 00:46:56.533
of this creature.

00:46:56.533 --> 00:47:04.000
And with this established,
finally established kinship

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.000
between Jewel's horse and
Whitfield's horse, in this

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.667
case, a very well-behaved horse,
not at all like the

00:47:12.667 --> 00:47:17.300
wild horse of Jewel, which also
explains why Whitfield is

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:22.033
a minister, whereas Jewel
is nothing like that.

00:47:22.033 --> 00:47:25.433
So it's the wildness in the
offspring that actually

00:47:25.433 --> 00:47:32.167
backward reproduces the mostly
law-abiding but not completely

00:47:32.167 --> 00:47:36.533
law-abiding identity
of the father.

00:47:36.533 --> 00:47:41.567
And just to add to that, here is
Darl observing everything.

00:47:41.567 --> 00:47:46.400
And this is the clearest
indication that the animal for

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.500
Whitfield is also the horse.

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:52.600
"On the horse he rode up to
Armstid's and came back on the

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:52.867
horse."

00:47:52.867 --> 00:47:56.533
It's almost too heavy-handed to
emphasize this detail over

00:47:56.533 --> 00:47:59.000
and over again, and it would
have been completely uncalled

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.167
for, except for the fact that
we really need to have a

00:48:04.167 --> 00:48:08.133
narrative genealogy for Jewel.

00:48:08.133 --> 00:48:11.967
And it is a narrative genealogy
that is told

00:48:11.967 --> 00:48:17.333
actually not only through a
human story, not only through

00:48:17.333 --> 00:48:23.367
the monologue of Addie in this
epic convention of the dead

00:48:23.367 --> 00:48:28.600
speaking, but is also told a
parallel epic convention of a
764
00:48:28,600 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
human story threaded through
a non-human creature.

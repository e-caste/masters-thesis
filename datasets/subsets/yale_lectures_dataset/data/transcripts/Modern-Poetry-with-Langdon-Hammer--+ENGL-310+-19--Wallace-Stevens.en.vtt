00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.626
Professor Langdon
Hammer: On Wednesday,

00:00:06.626 --> 00:00:13.085
I would like you to come having
read one of Stevens's longer

00:00:13.085 --> 00:00:16.243
poems.
It's not too long but it's a

00:00:16.243 --> 00:00:19.485
little longer:
"The Auroras of Autumn," which

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:21.180
is a wonderful poem.
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.823
It's not exactly timely at this
moment but please come having

00:00:29.823 --> 00:00:32.560
thought about it.
 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.953
As you read it,
think about images that you

00:00:38.953 --> 00:00:45.194
find in the poem of stars,
of the theater,

00:00:45.194 --> 00:00:54.640
of mother and father;
the poem is full of both.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.519
A friend asked me the other
day, "Are there any happy

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.439
poets?"
Well, of course no,

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.807
there really aren't,
or at least not any that are

00:01:08.807 --> 00:01:12.150
any good.
No, that's not true.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.440
In fact, as I think about the
syllabus, Williams is a happy

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.184
poet.
He calls himself the "happy

00:01:21.184 --> 00:01:25.522
genius" of his household in that
little poem, "Danse Russe,"

00:01:25.522 --> 00:01:29.860
where he's talking about running
around the house naked.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.223
Marianne Moore,
I think, in many ways is a

00:01:33.223 --> 00:01:37.543
happy poet.
But no poet is so happy as

00:01:37.543 --> 00:01:44.394
Wallace Stevens.
And Stevens is happy in the

00:01:44.394 --> 00:01:49.819
sense that he is a comic poet.
 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.962
And that doesn't mean that
you're going to laugh a lot

00:01:52.962 --> 00:01:56.580
while you read Wallace Stevens,
though you might sometimes.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.316
And he can be silly,
though that's perhaps not his

00:02:01.316 --> 00:02:06.115
strongest vein.
Stevens is a comic poet in the

00:02:06.115 --> 00:02:12.532
sense, in the generic sense of a
poet in whom and for whom and

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:16.950
with whom the world always comes
right.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.120
The world is right and good.
 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.342
It is a regenerative,
exhilarating,

00:02:24.342 --> 00:02:30.800
endlessly consoling and
meaningful place to dwell.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.430
And Stevens is,
you know, really as I read him

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.604
every year, I like him more and
more, and he becomes more and

00:02:41.604 --> 00:02:45.673
more important.
Stevens gives us,

00:02:45.673 --> 00:02:52.760
really, a comprehensive view of
the world and one in which

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.349
poetry and imagination have
central roles to play.

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.454
Imagination:
that's an important word in

00:03:02.454 --> 00:03:06.421
Stevens.
It's a word he takes right out

00:03:06.421 --> 00:03:12.342
of British romanticism and the
long tradition of romantic

00:03:12.342 --> 00:03:15.840
poetry.
And Stevens is,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.183
though in complex ways,
like Hart Crane,

00:03:22.183 --> 00:03:28.039
a defiantly romantic modern
poet.

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:31.091
Stevens's poetry,
like Moore's,

00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:36.991
like Crane's – to some extent
like Frost's – is always,

00:03:36.991 --> 00:03:39.840
in a sense, meta-poetry.
 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.574
That is, well,
he shares with these poets,

00:03:43.574 --> 00:03:47.310
as with certain others on our
syllabus,

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.833
the sense that poetry has to
always involve an investigation

00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:56.110
into its own rules:
how it works,

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.126
what it does,
what it's capable of,

00:04:00.126 --> 00:04:06.950
what its potential uses are;
and that all these are in a

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:13.876
sense open and available to
re-definition at a fundamental

00:04:13.876 --> 00:04:17.797
level.
He says--There's a sort of

00:04:17.797 --> 00:04:23.779
wonderful set of adages or
epigrams or statements at the

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:29.870
back of your book which come
from Stevens's "Adagia."

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.839
One of those statements is "all
poetry is experimental poetry."

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:42.474
And there's a sense in any
Stevens poem that Stevens is

00:04:42.474 --> 00:04:48.740
experimenting and is going in
some new direction,

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.764
not just at the beginning of
the poem but throughout the

00:04:51.764 --> 00:04:54.240
poem.
That's how it proceeds.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:01.361
You could compare this idea to
Williams's interest in newness

00:05:01.361 --> 00:05:08.840
and a sense of life as "always
subversive of life preceding."

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.730
It's a related idea for Stevens.
 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.630
In his poem,
"Of Modern Poetry," which is a

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.698
little essay on the subject of
what is modern poetry,

00:05:25.698 --> 00:05:30.483
Stevens says,
"It has / to construct a new

00:05:30.483 --> 00:05:33.686
stage."
And it not only has to

00:05:33.686 --> 00:05:37.750
construct that new stage,
it has to "be on it," too.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.741
And there's a way in which
Stevens's poems are both

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:46.851
creating a new space in which to
speak, and they're speaking from

00:05:46.851 --> 00:05:50.748
there.
These two things are going on

00:05:50.748 --> 00:05:54.747
at once.
Stevens also says in that set

00:05:54.747 --> 00:06:00.613
of "Adagia" – and there are
wonderful, provocative ones

00:06:00.613 --> 00:06:04.596
throughout,
"A poem is a pheasant," for one

00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:07.682
– he also says,
"Poetry is a means of

00:06:07.682 --> 00:06:11.019
redemption."
That's on page 972.

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:13.450
"Poetry is a means of
redemption."

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.600
He meant it, he meant it.
 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.060
For Stevens,
poetry stands in the place that

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.600
religion once did.
 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.898
Other poets that we've read
this semester look to poetry to

00:06:31.898 --> 00:06:37.220
serve different functions of
religion, I think.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:44.783
Eliot is concerned with ritual
and community and ways in which

00:06:44.783 --> 00:06:50.860
poetry might establish these,
constitute these.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:56.066
Moore is the most,
well, with Eliot,

00:06:56.066 --> 00:07:03.114
the most serious Christian;
is concerned with poetry as a

00:07:03.114 --> 00:07:08.301
model for ethical action,
as a kind of guide for conduct

00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:13.268
in the world.
And poetry models for her what

00:07:13.268 --> 00:07:20.529
she calls "love" or "hope" or
striving or "doing hard things."

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:25.187
For Stevens,
poetry takes over another

00:07:25.187 --> 00:07:29.720
dimension of religious
experience.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.426
Poetry takes over
Christianity's traditional

00:07:33.426 --> 00:07:37.909
concern with redemption,
and with redemption – with

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:46.500
questions about the afterlife,
paradise – the transcendental.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.904
How can culture imagine the
transcendental in a

00:07:50.904 --> 00:07:53.490
non-transcendental world?
 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:58.188
How can it imagine the
metaphysical in a

00:07:58.188 --> 00:08:01.199
non-metaphysical world?
 

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:06.879
How can we have Heaven if we
don't have God?

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:11.800
These are all questions in
Stevens's poetry.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:18.489
He answers them in ways that
put him on Hart Crane's side of

00:08:18.489 --> 00:08:21.209
the debate with Eliot.
 

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:25.230
In The Waste Land,
the decay of sacred authority;

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.420
this is a crisis of community,
of meaning;

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.500
language has lost its meaning.
 

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.940
 
 

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.998
For Crane, this condition,
rather than a crisis,

00:08:38.998 --> 00:08:42.971
is an opportunity,
an opportunity for poetry to

00:08:42.971 --> 00:08:45.129
"lend a myth to God."
 

00:08:45.129 --> 00:08:49.821
Eliot is disturbed to see God
as something constructed,

00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:54.251
something linguistic,
something we might lend a myth

00:08:54.251 --> 00:08:55.672
to;
only lend it,

00:08:55.672 --> 00:08:59.049
in the sense that we're going
to have to get it back.

00:08:59.049 --> 00:09:04.311
For Crane, for Stevens,
God always was a myth,

00:09:04.311 --> 00:09:10.976
a metaphor, and metaphors can
and need to be exchanged and

00:09:10.976 --> 00:09:13.899
renewed all the time.
 

00:09:13.899 --> 00:09:18.850
In this, Crane and Stevens are
very close together.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.519
 
 

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:27.393
Let's look at an early poem of
Wallace Stevens's,

00:09:27.393 --> 00:09:33.180
an early grand poem called
"Sunday Morning," the first one

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.430
in your Stevens's selection.
 

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.010
It's on page 237.
 

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:44.120
 
 

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:52.841
"Sunday Morning" was published
in Poetry magazine in

00:09:52.841 --> 00:09:58.327
1915, which is to say,
it's contemporary with

00:09:58.327 --> 00:10:03.789
Prufrock, roughly contemporary
with Marianne Moore's "A Grave";

00:10:03.789 --> 00:10:09.233
both poems that appeared in
Poetry,

00:10:09.233 --> 00:10:16.090
too.
Let's read this first stanza.

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:19.830
Complacencies of the
peignoir, and late

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.419
Coffee and oranges in a sunny
chair,

00:10:22.419 --> 00:10:25.289
And the green freedom of a
cockatoo

00:10:25.289 --> 00:10:31.480
Upon a rug [all these things]
mingle to dissipate

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.009
The holy hush of ancient
sacrifice.

00:10:36.009 --> 00:10:41.759
She dreams a little,
and she feels the dark

00:10:41.759 --> 00:10:46.297
Encroachment of that old
catastrophe, ["that old

00:10:46.297 --> 00:10:49.870
catastrophe" being the
crucifixion]

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.809
As a calm darkens among
water-lights.

00:10:52.809 --> 00:11:01.509
[Or if it's not the
crucifixion, it's the Fall.]

00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:07.179
The pungent oranges and bright,
green wings

00:11:07.179 --> 00:11:10.029
Seem things in some procession
of the dead,

00:11:10.029 --> 00:11:14.629
Winding across wide water,
without sound.

00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:20.039
The day is like wide water,
without sound,

00:11:20.039 --> 00:11:23.000
Stilled for the passing of her
dreaming feet

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.860
Over the seas,
to silent Palestine,

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:31.490
Dominion of the blood and
sepulchre.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:39.327
This is a poem about not going
to church, about doing something

00:11:39.327 --> 00:11:42.740
else with Sunday morning.
 

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:50.683
It announces or it takes for
granted really a great change in

00:11:50.683 --> 00:11:57.435
culture, a change in the
cultural order where Sunday

00:11:57.435 --> 00:12:04.392
morning is no longer spent,
or need not necessarily always

00:12:04.392 --> 00:12:06.389
be spent, at church.
 

00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:09.424
Stevens is writing about,
in some ways,

00:12:09.424 --> 00:12:11.899
the end of the Christian Era.
 

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:19.249
Of course, it's gone on but in
a different form from what it

00:12:19.249 --> 00:12:24.736
had been.
You could think about how

00:12:24.736 --> 00:12:34.779
little this poem is like a poem
on a similar theme in Yeats,

00:12:34.779 --> 00:12:39.279
such as "The Second Coming,"
where the end of Christianity is

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:43.855
an apocalyptic event and there's
some "rough beast" "slouching

00:12:43.855 --> 00:12:45.580
towards Bethlehem."
 

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:52.119
Instead, in Stevens the power
of the past, the Christian Era,

00:12:52.119 --> 00:12:55.279
simply dissipates – poof!
 

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:59.495
– dissolves in the
circumstances that he's

00:12:59.495 --> 00:13:07.490
describing.
What is a peignoir?

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:11.160
I think Stevens likes the
French word.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.500
This is a dressing gown.
 

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:20.528
We have a female figure here
presented to us in a space of

00:13:20.528 --> 00:13:28.201
domestic bourgeois luxury,
with comfort and complacency

00:13:28.201 --> 00:13:36.110
even, with coffee and oranges,
and a cockatoo.

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:42.215
Whether that cockatoo is
actually a bird or a design in

00:13:42.215 --> 00:13:51.061
the rug, critics have disagreed;
you can make that bird what you

00:13:51.061 --> 00:13:55.614
like.
This female presence that we're

00:13:55.614 --> 00:14:02.553
introduced to is a figure for
the poet, an unnamed "she" that

00:14:02.553 --> 00:14:05.559
the poem will be about.
 

00:14:05.559 --> 00:14:12.822
She, embodying poetic
sensibility, poetic thinking and

00:14:12.822 --> 00:14:18.989
poetic impulses,
seems to place poetry in this

00:14:18.989 --> 00:14:25.662
space of domestic comfort,
seems to identify poetry with

00:14:25.662 --> 00:14:29.109
the feminine,
with a female perspective,

00:14:29.109 --> 00:14:34.101
and with consumption,
with fine imported goods,

00:14:34.101 --> 00:14:38.580
as you will find elsewhere in
Stevens.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:46.529
She identifies a life of ease
with the imagination.

00:14:46.529 --> 00:14:51.514
Stevens's poetry,
like Yeats's in certain ways,

00:14:51.514 --> 00:14:57.222
though on very different terms,
or even like Eliot's,

00:14:57.222 --> 00:15:02.909
presents us with a number of
very powerful female figures

00:15:02.909 --> 00:15:08.190
with whom the poet identifies
his own creativity.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:11.600
This is an important one.
 

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:19.014
And there's an aspect of
Stevens that's gendered as

00:15:19.014 --> 00:15:22.870
feminine, you could say.
 

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:29.109
It's that aspect of Stevens
that identifies with poetry as a

00:15:29.109 --> 00:15:34.080
space apart from the masculine
world of work.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:39.937
Contrast this with Frost who
identifies poetry with

00:15:39.937 --> 00:15:45.442
subjective freedom,
a space apart from objective

00:15:45.442 --> 00:15:51.299
necessity, what Frost is always
responding to.

00:15:51.299 --> 00:15:57.317
Stevens maintains a complex
attitude, however,

00:15:57.317 --> 00:16:05.340
towards this identification of
poetry with aspects of culture

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:09.620
that are gendered as female.
 

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:14.898
There's a macho strain in
Stevens too, often a hyperbolic

00:16:14.898 --> 00:16:20.364
and somewhat comic one in which
Stevens is identifying with

00:16:20.364 --> 00:16:25.294
giants, big men.
And I'll talk more about that

00:16:25.294 --> 00:16:27.710
two lectures from now.
 

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:31.662
In this poem,
I think, well,

00:16:31.662 --> 00:16:39.858
possibly warding off the
anxiety of identifying poetry so

00:16:39.858 --> 00:16:45.860
clearly and strongly with the
female,

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:53.075
Stevens includes in stanza
seven, on pages 239 to 240,

00:16:53.075 --> 00:16:59.610
a kind of parodic celebration
of masculinity:

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.879
Supple and turbulent,
a ring of men

00:17:01.879 --> 00:17:04.049
Shall chant in orgy on a summer
morn

00:17:04.049 --> 00:17:06.099
Their boisterous devotion to
the sun,

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:08.259
Not as a god,
but as a god might be,

00:17:08.259 --> 00:17:10.720
Naked among them,
like a savage source.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:15.338
And so on.
This is another vein of

00:17:15.338 --> 00:17:21.057
Stevens's imagination and it's
here in this poem in,

00:17:21.057 --> 00:17:25.430
again, almost hyperbolic comic
form.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:33.991
If Stevens is anxious about
identifying poetry with the

00:17:33.991 --> 00:17:39.539
feminine, I think that's
because,

00:17:39.539 --> 00:17:44.804
in a sense, as Stevens sets
things up here at this early

00:17:44.804 --> 00:17:49.869
point in his career,
all poets are women poets on

00:17:49.869 --> 00:17:54.852
Sunday morning.
Poetry can only be written on

00:17:54.852 --> 00:18:00.187
Sunday morning or on the weekend
or after hours,

00:18:00.187 --> 00:18:03.480
at the end of the workday.
 

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:09.491
These are the spaces in which
in his life poetry exists,

00:18:09.491 --> 00:18:15.940
but more generally these are
the sort of cultural spaces,

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:22.670
the times, that Stevens
identifies poetry with.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:28.313
Here in this poem,
Stevens is brooding on the

00:18:28.313 --> 00:18:33.700
bourgeois image of the earthly
paradise;

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:39.013
that is, what it's like to have
a nice home and some free time

00:18:39.013 --> 00:18:42.492
in it.
It's a poem that Stevens wrote

00:18:42.492 --> 00:18:46.572
in his twenties,
in the earliest phase of his

00:18:46.572 --> 00:18:50.906
career.
Like Eliot, like Frost,

00:18:50.906 --> 00:18:54.609
Stevens went to Harvard.
 

00:18:54.609 --> 00:19:01.069
All these modern poets went to
Harvard.

00:19:01.069 --> 00:19:07.400
He was from early on divided in
his ambitions between poetry and

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.420
the law, a securely masculine
pursuit.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:17.538
Stevens tried journalism
briefly in New York and a legal

00:19:17.538 --> 00:19:23.991
practice before eventually he
entered the Hartford Accident

00:19:23.991 --> 00:19:28.329
and Indemnity Company in our
state,

00:19:28.329 --> 00:19:34.902
where he remained for the rest
of his life, becoming a national

00:19:34.902 --> 00:19:41.367
authority on surety bonds and
leading an extraordinary divided

00:19:41.367 --> 00:19:47.622
life: a life in which poetry was
identified with leisure and

00:19:47.622 --> 00:19:52.877
repose.
There's a kind of sybaritic

00:19:52.877 --> 00:19:57.760
quality to Stevens's
imagination.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:01.704
He luxuriates.
In another one of those

00:20:01.704 --> 00:20:05.950
"Adagia" he says,
"A poem is a café."

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:09.220
And so it is, in Stevens's case.
 

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:13.388
Poetry represents a kind of
release from objective

00:20:13.388 --> 00:20:18.067
disciplines, including the
nineteenth-century Protestant

00:20:18.067 --> 00:20:21.809
injunctions to refuse private
pleasures,

00:20:21.809 --> 00:20:28.045
to save for a future life,
perhaps a life beyond life,

00:20:28.045 --> 00:20:33.178
an afterlife.
This is the "Puritanism" that

00:20:33.178 --> 00:20:39.799
Crane objects to early in his
career and fights against.

00:20:39.799 --> 00:20:45.196
And Stevens,
too, is here in a more cautious

00:20:45.196 --> 00:20:48.710
way struggling against it.
 

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:53.411
On page 238,
in the second stanza of this

00:20:53.411 --> 00:20:58.701
poem, he says,
"Why should she give her bounty

00:20:58.701 --> 00:21:06.145
to the dead?"
Why should she give her spirit,

00:21:06.145 --> 00:21:15.279
her imaginative investments,
her hopes to the dead?

00:21:15.279 --> 00:21:23.985
Here, suggesting both the dead
Jesus and also a future life

00:21:23.985 --> 00:21:31.640
beyond life that Christianity
would look towards.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:39.482
Stevens is imagining earth
itself as where bounty is given

00:21:39.482 --> 00:21:44.160
and where it should be bestowed.
 

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.509
It's where we are.
 

00:21:47.509 --> 00:21:52.109
And he'll go on and describe it
in this stanza:

00:21:52.109 --> 00:21:54.730
What is divinity if it
can come

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.259
Only in silent shadows and in
dreams?

00:21:57.259 --> 00:22:00.829
Shall she not find in comforts
of the sun,

00:22:00.829 --> 00:22:03.205
In pungent fruit and bright,
green wings,

00:22:03.205 --> 00:22:05.556
or else
In any balm or beauty of the

00:22:05.556 --> 00:22:08.372
earth,
Things to be cherished like the

00:22:08.372 --> 00:22:09.819
thought of heaven?
 

00:22:09.819 --> 00:22:13.721
[No, divinity can't be off
somewhere else.

00:22:13.721 --> 00:22:18.193
It can't be beyond life.]
Divinity must live within

00:22:18.193 --> 00:22:21.619
herself: [And what form does it
take there?]

00:22:21.619 --> 00:22:26.009
Passions of rain,
or moods in falling snow;

00:22:26.009 --> 00:22:28.670
Grievings in loneliness,
or unsubdued

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.599
Elations when the forest blooms;
gusty

00:22:31.599 --> 00:22:34.309
Emotions on wet roads on autumn
nights;

00:22:34.309 --> 00:22:38.309
All pleasures and all pains,
remembering

00:22:38.309 --> 00:22:41.960
The bough of summer and the
winter branch.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:46.309
These are the measures destined
for her soul.

00:22:46.309 --> 00:22:53.912
Here, divinity must live within
the person in her subjectivity,

00:22:53.912 --> 00:23:01.269
a subjectivity that's modeled
on and represented as a version

00:23:01.269 --> 00:23:06.910
of the sensual encounter with
the seasons,

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:12.641
which are themselves revolving
and balanced and cyclical:

00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:17.349
"the bough of summer and the
winter branch."

00:23:17.349 --> 00:23:26.032
To say that paradise must be
here on earth is also to say

00:23:26.032 --> 00:23:32.079
that it must include death and
dying,

00:23:32.079 --> 00:23:35.973
a world of change,
a world that's always,

00:23:35.973 --> 00:23:39.769
in a sense, passing out of
existence.

00:23:39.769 --> 00:23:52.130
And Stevens says in stanza
five:

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:57.035
… "But in contentment
[she says, he says with her]

00:23:57.035 --> 00:24:01.241
I still feel
The need of some imperishable

00:24:01.241 --> 00:24:04.920
bliss."
Death is the mother of beauty;

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.116
hence from her,
Alone, shall come fulfillment

00:24:08.116 --> 00:24:11.390
to our dreams
And our desires.

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:18.855
Yes.
Paradise, if it is to exist on

00:24:18.855 --> 00:24:23.680
earth, must include death in it.
 

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:29.442
And as the poem moves towards
its close, that's what Stevens

00:24:29.442 --> 00:24:34.471
imagines for us.
It's also, well,

00:24:34.471 --> 00:24:46.329
it's a scene that he leaves us
with in the eighth stanza.

00:24:46.329 --> 00:24:52.568
It's a scene of a world of
plenty, a beautiful world but

00:24:52.568 --> 00:24:56.764
also a world which,
for these reasons,

00:24:56.764 --> 00:24:59.600
includes death in it.
 

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.630
Let's look at that.
 

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:10.632
It returns to the opening lines
of the poem, and then the camera

00:25:10.632 --> 00:25:17.300
pans out to give a view of the
landscape and the world around

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.265
us:
She hears,

00:25:19.265 --> 00:25:23.385
upon that water without sound,
A voice that cries,

00:25:23.385 --> 00:25:27.583
"The tomb in Palestine
Is not the porch of spirits

00:25:27.583 --> 00:25:30.116
lingering.
It is the grave of Jesus,

00:25:30.116 --> 00:25:35.190
where he lay."
The tomb is empty.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:42.359
Jesus is not a presence for us.
 

00:25:42.359 --> 00:25:49.120
And now Stevens moves for the
first time in the poem out of

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:54.481
that third person,
"she," to speak in the first

00:25:54.481 --> 00:25:59.564
person plural.
We live in an old chaos

00:25:59.564 --> 00:26:05.519
of the sun,
Or old dependency of day and

00:26:05.519 --> 00:26:09.125
night,
Or island solitude,

00:26:09.125 --> 00:26:11.549
unsponsored,
free,

00:26:11.549 --> 00:26:16.430
Of that wide water,
inescapable.

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:22.925
"We live in an old chaos of the
sun": we live in a world that is

00:26:22.925 --> 00:26:27.965
material.
It exists as a set of rocks,

00:26:27.965 --> 00:26:35.636
blasted across the universe,
that the sun structures and

00:26:35.636 --> 00:26:40.348
radiates.
Even as Stevens makes this

00:26:40.348 --> 00:26:46.659
declaration, characteristic of
him is the resistance to

00:26:46.659 --> 00:26:50.750
residing in any one formulation.
 

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:55.261
So, he'll say one thing and
then he'll say another,

00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:59.142
"or," and notice this pattern
here where he,

00:26:59.142 --> 00:27:02.029
in fact, gives us two "or"s.
 

00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:06.210
"Old dependency of day and
night": That's another way of

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:09.250
imaging our world where day and
night,

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:13.167
these essential contraries,
these essential natural forms,

00:27:13.167 --> 00:27:17.040
are dependent on each other,
are constituting each other

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.940
continuously.
We are dependent on them;

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.700
they are dependent on each
other.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:30.740
We exist "or" – perhaps –
in "island solitude."

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:35.061
Here the world,
the globe, this natural space,

00:27:35.061 --> 00:27:38.710
this earthly paradise,
is an island,

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:44.344
and a solitary one,
one without God out there,

00:27:44.344 --> 00:27:51.733
in a condition Stevens will
call "unsponsored" and therefore

00:27:51.733 --> 00:27:54.912
free.
"Of that wide water,

00:27:54.912 --> 00:28:01.071
inescapable," where that wide
water that was first introduced

00:28:01.071 --> 00:28:05.279
to us in the first stanza of the
poem,

00:28:05.279 --> 00:28:08.814
becomes a kind of image for a
silence in the world,

00:28:08.814 --> 00:28:11.360
which is the silence of a lack
of,

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:15.500
I think, divine language.
 

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.874
From these generalizations,
Stevens then moves to these

00:28:19.874 --> 00:28:23.289
particulars:
Deer walk upon our

00:28:23.289 --> 00:28:27.141
mountains, and the quail
Whistle about us their

00:28:27.141 --> 00:28:30.275
spontaneous cries;
Sweet berries ripen in the

00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:33.594
wilderness;
And, in the isolation of the

00:28:33.594 --> 00:28:36.990
sky,
At evening, casual flocks of

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:41.765
pigeons make
Ambiguous undulations as they

00:28:41.765 --> 00:28:46.021
sink,
Downward to darkness,

00:28:46.021 --> 00:28:52.047
on extended wings.
Stevens's approach,

00:28:52.047 --> 00:28:57.722
finally, is not to generalize
about the world but to describe

00:28:57.722 --> 00:29:00.898
it;
to not tell us how things

00:29:00.898 --> 00:29:06.740
should be or might be or were,
but rather how they are;

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.690
how they are now and at this
moment.

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:13.180
Stevens evokes the world in a
state of fullness,

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:16.081
of ripeness.
Those berries are ripening,

00:29:16.081 --> 00:29:18.839
there're deer walking on the
mountains.

00:29:18.839 --> 00:29:25.025
That present tense that he's
using evokes action that is

00:29:25.025 --> 00:29:27.500
ongoing, is present.
 

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:34.078
And yet all these essential
satisfactions that he evokes are

00:29:34.078 --> 00:29:36.420
colored by evening.
 

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:42.558
Pleasure here is shadowed by
death, not unhappily,

00:29:42.558 --> 00:29:49.700
but it is the color of the
environment, of the evening.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:55.508
The birds, they make a downward
movement, and yet their wings

00:29:55.508 --> 00:29:59.846
are extended.
Their undulations are ambiguous

00:29:59.846 --> 00:30:03.943
in that sense,
much as the "dependency of day

00:30:03.943 --> 00:30:07.109
and night" is itself ambiguous.
 

00:30:07.109 --> 00:30:12.388
You could contrast those birds
with Hart Crane's ascending

00:30:12.388 --> 00:30:16.370
seagull at the beginning of "The
Bridge."

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:19.210
This is a different image.
 

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:24.234
Stevens is here trying to image
for us a non-transcendental,

00:30:24.234 --> 00:30:26.789
secular vision of the world.
 

00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:38.430
Let's look ahead to another
poem, "The Poems of Our Climate"

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:50.070
on page 252, another poem
exploring the idea of paradise.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:54.019
 
 

00:30:54.019 --> 00:31:01.628
Stevens means here in that
title, "The Poems of Our

00:31:01.628 --> 00:31:06.193
Climate," America,
our culture,

00:31:06.193 --> 00:31:11.519
our environment,
our situation.

00:31:11.519 --> 00:31:15.776
It's a poem that you might read
alongside a poem like "England"

00:31:15.776 --> 00:31:17.150
by Marianne Moore.
 

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:24.529
He also means the poems of our
time or our moment.

00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:31.097
And our time or our moment for
Stevens is defined as a climate,

00:31:31.097 --> 00:31:36.817
as a kind of environment rather
than some other kind of

00:31:36.817 --> 00:31:44.019
overarching way of understanding
or defining the present moment.

00:31:44.019 --> 00:31:50.607
It's not, as the poem unfolds,
a question about nature so much

00:31:50.607 --> 00:31:52.660
as about culture.
 

00:31:52.660 --> 00:32:01.519
Stevens will here explore one
of his recurrent impulses;

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:05.934
that is, to renew poetry by
simplifying terms,

00:32:05.934 --> 00:32:10.544
by getting down to some
essentials, some primary

00:32:10.544 --> 00:32:14.982
elements.
If Stevens is a sensualist,

00:32:14.982 --> 00:32:18.380
he's also a kind of ascetic.
 

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:23.994
He can be both and even finds,
I suppose, a kind of sensual

00:32:23.994 --> 00:32:28.349
asceticism, and this poem
exemplifies that.

00:32:28.349 --> 00:32:31.000
Clear water in a
brilliant bowl,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.540
Pink and white carnations.
 

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:37.330
The light
In the room more like a snowy

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:39.380
air,
Reflecting snow.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:45.153
A newly-fallen snow
At the end of winter when

00:32:45.153 --> 00:32:47.299
afternoons return.
 

00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:51.230
[We still don't have a main
verb yet.]

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:54.770
Pink and white carnations--one
desires

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:57.100
So much more than that.
 

00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:01.130
The day itself
Is simplified: a bowl of white,

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:05.089
Cold, a cold porcelain,
low and round,

00:33:05.089 --> 00:33:09.329
With nothing more than the
carnations there.

00:33:09.329 --> 00:33:16.403
This is Stevens exploring
another version of secularity,

00:33:16.403 --> 00:33:21.398
of the secular,
giving us a poetry it seems,

00:33:21.398 --> 00:33:25.411
as he starts,
not of ideas but of things,

00:33:25.411 --> 00:33:28.320
as Williams might approve.
 

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.740
It is a world of white.
 

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:38.804
You can understand the impulse
here as a version of the

00:33:38.804 --> 00:33:46.653
reduction to nakedness or the
reduction to primary terms that

00:33:46.653 --> 00:33:50.839
Imagism seeks to accomplish.
 

00:33:50.839 --> 00:33:55.470
And these are,
in a sense, precisely images

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:59.329
that Stevens is presenting to
us,

00:33:59.329 --> 00:34:03.554
almost as a kind of still-life
there: that clear water in a

00:34:03.554 --> 00:34:07.269
brilliant bowl and the pink and
white carnations,

00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:13.167
where that word "carnation" –
from the Latin,

00:34:13.167 --> 00:34:20.730
meaning flesh – evokes the
colors of the body and of blood

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:26.320
and of flesh,
and yet those qualities are

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:32.763
here held in a kind of
suspension that contains them

00:34:32.763 --> 00:34:38.826
and treats them coolly and
arranges them and it's

00:34:38.826 --> 00:34:42.489
unsatisfying to Stevens.
 

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:48.380
The moment he has created this
still life, he starts to want to

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:51.769
get rid of it.
He says:

00:34:51.769 --> 00:34:55.456
Say even that this
complete simplicity [that I've

00:34:55.456 --> 00:34:59.074
just produced here]
Stripped one [in fact,

00:34:59.074 --> 00:35:01.557
of the heat,
of the flesh]

00:35:01.557 --> 00:35:05.990
of all one's torments,
concealed

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:11.418
The evilly compounded, vital I
And made if fresh in a world of

00:35:11.418 --> 00:35:13.367
white,
A world of clear water,

00:35:13.367 --> 00:35:17.543
brilliant-edged,
Still one would want more,

00:35:17.543 --> 00:35:22.195
one would need more,
More than a world of white and

00:35:22.195 --> 00:35:24.718
snowy scents.
And again, this is

00:35:24.718 --> 00:35:27.429
characteristic of Stevens and
his imagination.

00:35:27.429 --> 00:35:30.900
If he said one thing,
he will now try something else.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:36.539
He will now turn his strategy
in another direction.

00:35:36.539 --> 00:35:44.179
He continues here affirming
powers of mind:

00:35:44.179 --> 00:35:47.559
There would still remain
the never-resting mind,

00:35:47.559 --> 00:35:51.579
So that one would want to
escape, come back

00:35:51.579 --> 00:35:55.380
To what had been so long
composed.

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.570
The imperfect is our paradise.
 

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:04.170
Note that, in this bitterness,
delight,

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:07.849
Since the imperfect is so hot
in us,

00:36:07.849 --> 00:36:14.840
Lies in flawed words and
stubborn sounds.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:19.150
The "never-resting mind" always
wants more.

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:23.462
Even as it wants to get down to
primary terms,

00:36:23.462 --> 00:36:26.050
it then wants more again.
 

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:31.339
Paradise is "the imperfect,"
"the imperfect" meaning,

00:36:31.339 --> 00:36:35.509
again, Stevens is always
playing on Latin,

00:36:35.509 --> 00:36:39.517
I think;
the imperfect is the

00:36:39.517 --> 00:36:45.650
incompleted, the not finished,
the ongoing.

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:51.896
And, too, there are tinges in
that word "imperfect" of

00:36:51.896 --> 00:36:58.613
corruption, of fallenness,
of flaws, as Stevens will go on

00:36:58.613 --> 00:37:02.510
to say.
The imperfect is something

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:06.909
that's not cold but "hot," as
people are hot,

00:37:06.909 --> 00:37:11.872
hot with desire.
It's the heat of desire that

00:37:11.872 --> 00:37:15.045
shows itself,
as Stevens says,

00:37:15.045 --> 00:37:19.530
in "flawed words and stubborn
sounds."

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:25.086
Stevens affirms the
"never-resting mind" but above

00:37:25.086 --> 00:37:31.436
all he affirms a kind of
continuing impulse and demand to

00:37:31.436 --> 00:37:35.256
speak,
to find "flawed words and

00:37:35.256 --> 00:37:37.190
stubborn sounds."
 

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:40.807
Over the course of the poem,
Stevens moves from a still

00:37:40.807 --> 00:37:45.070
world to a world in action,
and he moves from a world

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:50.639
that's visual to a world that is
verbal, that's linguistic.

00:37:50.639 --> 00:37:56.018
Here and elsewhere in Stevens,
language is the privileged

00:37:56.018 --> 00:37:59.860
medium of human desire and
aspiration.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:05.250
It's what gives us "delight,"
his word here;

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:10.999
it gives us pleasure,
and in this sense it remains

00:38:10.999 --> 00:38:17.453
– language does – on the
side of leisure and of play

00:38:17.453 --> 00:38:22.030
rather than of discipline and
work.

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:27.028
And yet, also note the
implications of those

00:38:27.028 --> 00:38:31.631
adjectives.
"Flawed": "flawed" implies

00:38:31.631 --> 00:38:36.030
craft, some kind of making,
I think.

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:40.137
And "stubborn":
"stubborn" suggests

00:38:40.137 --> 00:38:43.400
perseverance,
discipline;

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:49.492
perhaps surprisingly,
a kind of continuing will to,

00:38:49.492 --> 00:38:54.610
well, not to rest and to go on
speaking.

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:59.594
These values that emerge in
this poem are,

00:38:59.594 --> 00:39:03.119
well, recurrent in Stevens.
 

00:39:03.119 --> 00:39:08.849
You'll find him exploring them,
celebrating them elsewhere.

00:39:08.849 --> 00:39:16.966
Let's go forward to the poem
called "The Man on the Dump," on

00:39:16.966 --> 00:39:26.681
page 254, for another poem,
again, exploring and affirming

00:39:26.681 --> 00:39:32.860
certain capacities of language.
 

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:40.901
This is Stevens at play in the
landscape of The Waste

00:39:40.901 --> 00:39:44.409
Land, if you like.
 

00:39:44.409 --> 00:39:51.648
Stevens in a letter explains
that on his way to work – he

00:39:51.648 --> 00:39:58.013
walked to work from West
Hartford to downtown – he

00:39:58.013 --> 00:40:03.119
would observe,
during the Depression,

00:40:03.119 --> 00:40:10.660
a man on the dump and composed
this poem prompted by him.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.440
Day creeps down.
 

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:16.409
The moon is creeping up.
 

00:40:16.409 --> 00:40:19.440
The sun is a corbeil of flowers
the moon

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:24.480
Blanche [of course she's
Blanche, it's the white moon]

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.790
Places there, a bouquet.
 

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:33.289
Ho-ho… The dump is full
Of images [just like The

00:40:33.289 --> 00:40:34.750
Waste Land].
 

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:39.730
Days pass like papers from a
press.

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:41.780
The bouquets come here in the
papers.

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.853
So the sun,
And so the moon,

00:40:43.853 --> 00:40:45.960
both come, and the janitor's
poems

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:49.528
Of every day,
the wrapper on the can of

00:40:49.528 --> 00:40:52.357
pears,
The cat in the paper-bag,

00:40:52.357 --> 00:40:55.169
the corset, the box
From Estonia:

00:40:55.169 --> 00:40:58.000
the tiger chest,
for tea.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.191
If Stevens celebrates desire,
celebrates consumption and

00:41:03.191 --> 00:41:06.401
sensual pleasure,
as he does, well,

00:41:06.401 --> 00:41:10.460
that makes a certain amount of
garbage.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:16.090
That makes a certain amount of
waste.

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:24.234
If you are constantly seeking
new ways of phrasing and

00:41:24.234 --> 00:41:29.876
understanding the world,
you're going to have to be

00:41:29.876 --> 00:41:33.929
getting rid of the ones you just
had, the ones that you were just

00:41:33.929 --> 00:41:37.027
using.
And the dump is an image of

00:41:37.027 --> 00:41:42.269
this, which Stevens confronts
here with a certain kind of

00:41:42.269 --> 00:41:46.295
irritation, playful but not so
far, I think,

00:41:46.295 --> 00:41:50.356
from despair.
The dump is a place of old

00:41:50.356 --> 00:41:55.016
poetry, and, of course,
Stevens's own poetry doesn't

00:41:55.016 --> 00:41:57.210
want to end up there.
 

00:41:57.210 --> 00:42:02.443
Or maybe it does,
since Stevens is able to find

00:42:02.443 --> 00:42:08.360
in the dump a certain kind of
regenerative power:

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.964
The freshness of night
[any poet knows]

00:42:11.964 --> 00:42:14.340
has been fresh a long time.
 

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.778
The freshness of morning,
the blowing of day,

00:42:17.778 --> 00:42:20.439
one says
That it puffs as Cornelius

00:42:20.439 --> 00:42:24.844
Nepos reads, it puffs
More than, less than or it

00:42:24.844 --> 00:42:31.884
puffs like this or that.
Maybe it's just all air,

00:42:31.884 --> 00:42:37.199
these poems.
Stevens is talking about the

00:42:37.199 --> 00:42:39.570
problem of cliché.
 

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:45.709
He's talking about,
well, the way in which any

00:42:45.709 --> 00:42:50.075
formulation dies,
becomes frozen,

00:42:50.075 --> 00:42:55.670
becomes a bouquet you must
throw out.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:43:01.553
This is a condition in The
Waste Land that Eliot

00:43:01.553 --> 00:43:04.059
profoundly mistrusts.
 

00:43:04.059 --> 00:43:12.065
Stevens, on the other hand,
sees in it a potential for a

00:43:12.065 --> 00:43:20.070
vision of the self that is
consoling and is powerful.

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:25.607
Stevens generates,
as the poem goes on,

00:43:25.607 --> 00:43:32.019
an image of the poet as a man
on the dump,

00:43:32.019 --> 00:43:37.972
one who "beats an old tin can"
and makes stubborn sounds,

00:43:37.972 --> 00:43:45.940
which are, if you like,
sounds of his own stubbornness.

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:49.369
Stevens is willing,
as Eliot is not,

00:43:49.369 --> 00:43:55.250
to make belief be a personal
thing, to be something that each

00:43:55.250 --> 00:44:00.835
of us constructs out of our own
will and our own powers of

00:44:00.835 --> 00:44:04.239
speech.
As the poem develops,

00:44:04.239 --> 00:44:10.120
Stevens goes through a kind of
a gesture of throwing things

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:13.443
out;
a kind of reduction to primary

00:44:13.443 --> 00:44:18.931
terms that is like "The Poems of
Our Climate," as around line 21

00:44:18.931 --> 00:44:22.121
or so he says:
Now in the time of spring

00:44:22.121 --> 00:44:24.297
(azaleas, trilliums,
Myrtle, viburnums,

00:44:24.297 --> 00:44:27.230
daffodils, blue phlox) [you
know all the names],

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:30.597
Between that disgust and this
[and I think there is disgust in

00:44:30.597 --> 00:44:32.630
the poem],
between the things

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:35.119
That are on the dump (azaleas
and so on)

00:44:35.119 --> 00:44:38.420
And those that will be (azaleas
and so on),

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:41.800
One feels the purifying change.
 

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:46.510
One rejects
The trash.

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:54.651
And as one rejects the trash,
as one gets down to some kind

00:44:54.651 --> 00:44:59.435
of primary whiteness,
some kind of fresh seeing of

00:44:59.435 --> 00:45:02.769
the world, we then start to see
the moon in perhaps different

00:45:02.769 --> 00:45:07.256
terms,
not merely as "Blanche," some

00:45:07.256 --> 00:45:15.092
old lady from poems from the
past, but perhaps in some new

00:45:15.092 --> 00:45:18.210
terms.
Stevens says:

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:19.930
That's the moment when
the moon creeps up

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:22.100
To the bubbling of bassoons.
 

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:24.090
That's the time
One looks at the

00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:28.409
elephant-colorings of tires
[even this ugliness is

00:45:28.409 --> 00:45:32.739
interesting].
Everything is shed;

00:45:32.739 --> 00:45:36.079
the moon comes up then as the
moon

00:45:36.079 --> 00:45:39.440
(All its images are in the
dump) [you have to see it

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.889
freshly]
and you see

00:45:40.889 --> 00:45:42.659
[because you're seeing freshly
now]

00:45:42.659 --> 00:45:46.820
As a man (not like an image of
a man),

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:50.960
You see the moon rise in the
empty sky.

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:56.519
One sits and beats an old tin
can, lard pail.

00:45:56.519 --> 00:46:00.289
One beats and beats for that
which one believes.

00:46:00.289 --> 00:46:04.060
That's what one wants to get
near.

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:08.070
Could it after all
Be merely oneself…

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:11.869
That you want to get near,
that you need to get near?

00:46:11.869 --> 00:46:17.223
Stevens is willing to say yes,
whereas Eliot is,

00:46:17.223 --> 00:46:21.780
as I say, frightened of this
prospect.

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:26.760
… as superior as the ear
To a crow's voice?

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:29.920
Did the nightingale torture the
ear,

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.450
Pack the heart and scratch the
mind?

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:35.910
And does the ear
Solace itself in peevish birds?

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:40.119
Is it peace,
Is it a philosopher's

00:46:40.119 --> 00:46:43.880
honeymoon, one finds
On the dump?

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:46.500
Is it to sit among the
mattresses of the dead,

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:50.233
Bottles, pots,
shoes and grass and murmur

00:46:50.233 --> 00:46:55.068
aptest eve:
Is it to hear the blatter of

00:46:55.068 --> 00:46:58.600
grackles and say
Invisible priest;

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:02.894
is it to eject, to pull
The day to pieces and cry

00:47:02.894 --> 00:47:04.309
stanza my stone?
 

00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:08.770
Where was it one first heard of
the truth?

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:15.332
The the.
It's a wonderful poem that's on

00:47:15.332 --> 00:47:19.219
the verge of nonsense,
that's on the verge of a kind

00:47:19.219 --> 00:47:23.772
of personal language that,
as I say, is an apocalyptic

00:47:23.772 --> 00:47:28.979
thing in The Waste Land
but is here a source of energy

00:47:28.979 --> 00:47:31.929
and power and play for Stevens.
 

00:47:31.929 --> 00:47:36.809
Stevens is not afraid of
nonsense, he's not afraid of

00:47:36.809 --> 00:47:39.530
idiosyncrasy of expression.
 

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:45.280
He is willing to play with
words.

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:53.422
Linguistic play puts Stevens in
touch with a kind of primal

00:47:53.422 --> 00:47:58.238
poetic resource.
Stevens understands truth as

00:47:58.238 --> 00:48:04.641
something that is linguistic;
it's something constructed in

00:48:04.641 --> 00:48:07.640
and through language.
 

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:11.829
It is therefore perishable.
 

00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:17.490
It is also for the same reason
renewable.

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:20.710
Look at that last line.
 

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:23.470
"Where was it one first heard
of the truth?

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:28.530
The the."
"The the," if you prefer.

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:37.349
That last sentence fragment,
"The the," what is that?

00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:40.894
Is that an answer or a
clarification to the question,

00:48:40.894 --> 00:48:44.030
"Where was it one first heard
of the truth?"

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:46.317
In other words,
where did this idea of truth

00:48:46.317 --> 00:48:47.700
come from to begin with?
 

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:48.790
Where did you get that idea?
 

00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:49.989
Why do you want it?
 

00:48:49.989 --> 00:48:53.386
You want it because it is
something that you have heard

00:48:53.386 --> 00:48:56.275
about;
it is something that has been

00:48:56.275 --> 00:48:59.631
spoken of.
It has come to us as language

00:48:59.631 --> 00:49:06.199
has framed it.
"The the": the definite article.

00:49:06.199 --> 00:49:10.820
It's the definite article that
makes the truth the truth.

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:13.650
Otherwise, it would be merely
only what?

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:19.191
A truth.
That is, to indicate and

00:49:19.191 --> 00:49:26.434
declare truth in its
singularity, to give it this

00:49:26.434 --> 00:49:32.320
status – that is a linguistic
act.

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:37.206
The truth is the function,
as Stevens understands it,

00:49:37.206 --> 00:49:42.280
of a certain linguistic
capacity: in this case a verbal

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:47.543
formula which takes priority
ultimately over any specific

00:49:47.543 --> 00:49:51.019
content or doctrine,
any truth.

00:49:51.019 --> 00:49:56.269
In that sense,
the truth lies in "The the."

00:49:56.269 --> 00:50:01.316
"The the" is here
representative of the human

00:50:01.316 --> 00:50:05.789
capacity for declaration,
for statement,

00:50:05.789 --> 00:50:11.179
a specifically verbal and
linguistic power.

00:50:11.179 --> 00:50:17.345
The truth that it represents is
not in any sense a final term,

00:50:17.345 --> 00:50:20.984
a last word,
a doctrine, a particular

00:50:20.984 --> 00:50:23.409
content of any kind.
 

00:50:23.409 --> 00:50:28.571
Instead, it points to a way of
thinking, a medium of thought,

00:50:28.571 --> 00:50:33.824
a medium of thought and desire,
a process which is a process of

00:50:33.824 --> 00:50:38.810
naming or, as Stevens would also
call it in "Of Modern Poetry",

00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:41.190
an "act of finding."
 

00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:45.310
This is what language does in
Stevens.

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:49.050
It creates the world;
it finds the world;

00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:56.061
it constructs the world through
such elementary terms as the

00:50:56.061 --> 00:50:58.320
definite article.
 

00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:04.852
Well, we'll hear more about the
implications of this perspective

00:51:04.852 --> 00:51:09.000
on experience next time and
following.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.384
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: All right,

00:00:03.384 --> 00:00:04.950
so let's begin Part II of
Rotations.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.116
I thought I should summarize
for you the main points,

00:00:08.116 --> 00:00:11.891
because you learned a whole lot
of stuff, but you don't have to

00:00:11.891 --> 00:00:15.669
carry all that in your head.
What I'm going to write down is

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.970
the essential subject you should
know.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.844
So, we were going to do
rotation of rigid bodies,

00:00:24.844 --> 00:00:28.320
which are forced to lie on the
xy plane.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.892
They have some shape.
And here are the main ideas we

00:00:33.892 --> 00:00:36.542
should know.
You first pick a point around

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:40.434
which you want to rotate the
body by driving a little skewer

00:00:40.434 --> 00:00:43.150
through that.
That's the point of rotation.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.280
Then, here are the things we
learned.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.257
First of all,
the body has a mass M,

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:52.190
which is a simple thing.
You put it on the weighing

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.115
machine, that's the mass.
Then, it has a moment of

00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:58.251
inertia, which,
if the body were made of a

00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:02.301
discreet set of points,
would be the mass of each

00:01:02.301 --> 00:01:07.166
point, m_i
times the square of its distance

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:11.276
from the point of rotation.
For a continuous distribution

00:01:11.276 --> 00:01:14.042
of matter like this one,
the sum is replaced by an

00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:14.720
integral.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.034
For example,
for a rod it was

00:01:21.034 --> 00:01:27.708
ML^(2)/12 around one of
the ends, around the center of

00:01:27.708 --> 00:01:31.290
mass.
And for a disk,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.089
it was MR^(2)/2.
So, every body has a moment of

00:01:37.089 --> 00:01:39.950
inertia.
Here is the important caveat,

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.879
with respect to a particular
point.

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:45.830
There is nothing called "the
moment of inertia," because

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.620
depending on the point,
these distances will vary.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.797
Okay.
Then, if you want the rigid

00:01:51.797 --> 00:01:54.791
body to start doing interesting
things, you wanted it to move

00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:56.951
around,
it will have an angle of

00:01:56.951 --> 00:02:00.204
velocity ω,
which is rate at--which goes

00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:03.623
round and round.
It's the usual frequency times

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:07.480
2π because 2π
radians are full circle.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.070
Then, it has an angular
momentum, which is the analog of

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.725
the mass, times analog of the
velocity, as is universally

00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:16.880
noted by the symbol L.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.009
Then, if you want to change
this angular momentum,

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.643
it's like asking,
"How do you change the ordinary

00:02:25.643 --> 00:02:28.500
momentum of a particle?"
You apply a force.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.669
So, now we apply what's called
a torque.

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:35.370
And the torque is the reason
the angular momentum changes.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.448
That's--The analog of force is
the reason the usual momentum

00:02:39.448 --> 00:02:41.513
changes.
I remind you,

00:02:41.513 --> 00:02:45.843
P = mv,
so it is really mdv/dt =

00:02:45.843 --> 00:02:48.473
ma.
So, you can also write

00:02:48.473 --> 00:02:51.835
analogously here,
τ = Iα because if you

00:02:51.835 --> 00:02:54.410
take the d/dt of this
guy,

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.156
that's a constant,
and α is a rate of

00:02:58.156 --> 00:03:01.952
change of ω.
The last thing I have to tell

00:03:01.952 --> 00:03:05.729
you is what is the torque of the
total torque on a body.

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:08.949
Well, if there is a force,
for example,

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:13.610
acting in that direction,
let me just take one force,

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.363
and it's separated by distance
r, or vector r

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:21.181
from the point of rotation.
Define that angle θ as

00:03:21.181 --> 00:03:24.483
the angle between this point of
separation distance,

00:03:24.483 --> 00:03:27.720
and separation r,
and the applied force.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.870
Then, the torque is F
times r times sin

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.550
θ.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.924
If you took F to be
perpendicular to this separation

00:03:38.924 --> 00:03:42.164
vector, then sin θ = 1.
If you took F to be

00:03:42.164 --> 00:03:45.506
parallel to the separation
vector, torque vanishes because

00:03:45.506 --> 00:03:48.906
it's no use applying a force in
the line joining you to the

00:03:48.906 --> 00:03:50.927
center,
because you don't produce

00:03:50.927 --> 00:03:53.396
rotations then.
The sin θ tells you how

00:03:53.396 --> 00:03:56.020
much of the force is good at
producing rotations.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.523
If you got many forces and many
torques, you got to add all the

00:04:00.523 --> 00:04:03.216
torques.
There's one thing to be careful

00:04:03.216 --> 00:04:04.389
about.
For example,

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.791
you can have a body where one
force is trying to do that,

00:04:07.791 --> 00:04:10.526
and here maybe a second force
acting that way,

00:04:10.526 --> 00:04:14.441
trying to do the opposite.
So, we keep track of the torque

00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:17.980
by saying either it's clockwise
or counter-clockwise.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.000
Each force you can tell
intuitively by looking at it.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.660
This guy's making it go
counter-clockwise.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.317
This is rotating clockwise.
Counter-clockwise will be taken

00:04:27.317 --> 00:04:29.571
positive;
clockwise will be taken

00:04:29.571 --> 00:04:32.983
negative.
Similarly, angular acceleration

00:04:32.983 --> 00:04:36.633
will be positive if it's
counter-clockwise,

00:04:36.633 --> 00:04:40.115
increasing.
So, this is a summary of

00:04:40.115 --> 00:04:43.890
everything we did yesterday,
on Monday.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.094
You guys follow that?
So, there's the analogy to F

00:04:47.094 --> 00:04:49.072
= ma.
Everything has a rotational

00:04:49.072 --> 00:04:52.064
counterpart, but life is more
difficult because in the case

00:04:52.064 --> 00:04:54.385
of F = ma,
m was simply given to

00:04:54.385 --> 00:04:57.092
you.
Here, the moment of inertia has

00:04:57.092 --> 00:05:01.216
to be calculated from scratch,
given the mass distribution

00:05:01.216 --> 00:05:04.819
that forms the body.
Similarly, you may have been

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.730
simply given the forces in F
= ma.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.409
But here, even after I give you
the forces, you got to do some

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.138
work, calculating the torque.
But every force you got to find

00:05:15.138 --> 00:05:18.496
how far it is from the point of
rotation, watch the angle

00:05:18.496 --> 00:05:22.333
between the force and the vector
separating where the force is to

00:05:22.333 --> 00:05:25.930
where the rotation is taking
place and calculating the sin

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.680
θ.
Okay, that's all we did.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.032
And what I did towards the end
of the class was to calculate

00:05:34.032 --> 00:05:36.759
the moment of inertia for a
couple of objects.

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:39.690
I showed you for a disk,
it's MR^(2)/2.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.730
For a rod, I did two
calculations:

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.246
one was around this end,
and the moment of inertia

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:50.839
around the end was
ML^(2)/3,

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:54.873
and the moment of inertia
around the center was

00:05:54.873 --> 00:05:58.977
ML^(2)/12.
And at the end of the lecture I

00:05:58.977 --> 00:06:01.649
said, "Notice the following
fact.

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:05.255
The moment of inertia through
the end and the moment of

00:06:05.255 --> 00:06:08.928
inertia through the center of
mass are related in a very

00:06:08.928 --> 00:06:11.938
simple way,
which is the moment of inertia

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:15.686
with respect to the new point,
the moment of inertia with

00:06:15.686 --> 00:06:20.038
respect to the center,
plus the mass of the entire rod

00:06:20.038 --> 00:06:24.271
times the square of the
distance, (L/2)^(2)

00:06:24.271 --> 00:06:29.110
separating the axis going
through the center of mass,

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.420
and the new axis.

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:36.970
And that's called the Parallel
Axis Theorem.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.029
And I'm going to show you in
general why it is true.

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:44.608
The Parallel Axis Theorem says,
"If you know the moment of

00:06:44.608 --> 00:06:47.579
inertia through the center of
mass,

00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:50.744
you are done," because then the
moment of inertia through any

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:53.856
other point does not require you
to go back and do the whole

00:06:53.856 --> 00:06:56.736
integral one more time.
I'll tell you the answer once

00:06:56.736 --> 00:06:58.404
and for all.
The answer is:

00:06:58.404 --> 00:07:01.881
take the moment of inertia at
the center of mass,

00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:06.011
add to it, in general the mass
of the whole body times the

00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:10.430
square of the distance between
the center of mass and your new

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.929
axis.
For example,

00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:14.080
you want to rotate it around
this point.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.769
That's the distance d;
add that Md^(2).

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:22.560
So, I said I don't want to just
give you a result;

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.560
I want to tell you where
everything comes from.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.319
So, I will now prove this.
So, let's start with that proof.

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:35.579
So, this is the proof of the
Parallel Axis Theorem.

00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:39.052
Before I do the Parallel Axis
Theorem, I'm going to use one

00:07:39.052 --> 00:07:41.531
result in vectors,
so you might as well be

00:07:41.531 --> 00:07:43.816
reminded of that,
because I use it freely,

00:07:43.816 --> 00:07:46.379
and I don't want you to get
caught in that.

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:51.313
If A is a vector,
then the length of A^(2)

00:07:51.313 --> 00:07:55.170
is found by taking A dot
A.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:59.020
A.A is the length of
A times the cosine of the

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.500
angle between A and
A.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.003
Well, the angle between
A and A is zero,

00:08:04.003 --> 00:08:06.665
and cosine is just 1;
therefore, the way to find the

00:08:06.665 --> 00:08:09.712
length of a vector is to take
the dot product of the vector

00:08:09.712 --> 00:08:12.441
with itself.
Another way to say this is,

00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:16.468
the dot product of A and
B, you remember is

00:08:16.468 --> 00:08:19.488
AxBx + AyBy,
so A with itself is

00:08:19.488 --> 00:08:23.029
Ax^(2) + Ay^(2) which is
the length squared of A.

00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:27.437
The result I want to use today
is, if you take vector A

00:08:27.437 --> 00:08:31.747
and add to it vector B,
and you want to find the length

00:08:31.747 --> 00:08:35.227
squared of A + B,
well, you take the dot product

00:08:35.227 --> 00:08:36.710
of that with itself,

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.574
and when you do the dot product
you can open out the brackets as

00:08:42.574 --> 00:08:45.899
if it is an ordinary product.
So, you can do this in your

00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:50.058
head, you'll get the length of
A^(2) from doing the

00:08:50.058 --> 00:08:52.490
A.A,
length of B^(2) from

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.377
doing the B.B;
then, you'll get an A.B +

00:08:55.377 --> 00:08:57.549
B.A, and these are both
equal;

00:08:57.549 --> 00:09:01.010
then, you will get twice
A.B.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:01.870
That's the result I want to use.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:12.898
So, here is the calculation.
Let's take some arbitrary

00:09:12.898 --> 00:09:15.281
object.
And you want to find the

00:09:15.281 --> 00:09:17.960
center, the moment of inertia
around that point.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:28.769
This is the center of mass.
This is a part of the body that

00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:33.228
I'm calling i.
Actually, you should integrate

00:09:33.228 --> 00:09:35.350
over it, but let's do it as a
sum.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.975
Mentally, divide this body into
a hundred thousand million tiny

00:09:38.975 --> 00:09:41.883
little squares,
which when tiled together form

00:09:41.883 --> 00:09:45.774
this object because it's easier
for me to work with a sum than

00:09:45.774 --> 00:09:49.591
with an integral.
So, this fellow has some mass

00:09:49.591 --> 00:09:52.949
m_i.
It has a location,

00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:57.157
which is r_i
and I'm going to call it

00:09:57.157 --> 00:10:01.375
r_i prime,
because the prime means it's

00:10:01.375 --> 00:10:04.129
the distance measured from this
new axis.

00:10:04.129 --> 00:10:08.475
I'm going to reserve the symbol
r_i for the

00:10:08.475 --> 00:10:11.200
separation from the center of
mass.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.769
Because the center of mass is a
privileged point,

00:10:13.769 --> 00:10:16.659
all distance measured from it
won't carry off prime.

00:10:16.659 --> 00:10:19.300
If you pick an arbitrary point,
I want to put a prime for that

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.845
one.
Then, d is the vector

00:10:21.845 --> 00:10:26.662
that tells you how to go from
your chosen axis to the center

00:10:26.662 --> 00:10:27.560
of mass.

00:10:31.899 --> 00:10:35.240
So, what is the moment of
inertia I'm trying to calculate

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.727
with respect to this point?
It's the sum over i,

00:10:38.727 --> 00:10:42.696
the mass of the little fellow
here, m_i times

00:10:42.696 --> 00:10:45.169
r_i prime
squared.

00:10:45.169 --> 00:10:49.298
But r_i prime
squared, you can see,

00:10:49.298 --> 00:10:53.102
is the length of
r_i + d

00:10:53.102 --> 00:10:54.637
dot,
product with

00:10:54.637 --> 00:10:59.224
r_i + d,
using the result I established

00:10:59.224 --> 00:11:02.405
above.
Okay, now, let's start opening

00:11:02.405 --> 00:11:06.850
out the brackets and look at the
terms you will get.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.228
First, you'll take dot product
of this guy or this guy,

00:11:09.228 --> 00:11:10.769
because
r_i^(2),

00:11:10.769 --> 00:11:13.506
that's going to be
m_ir

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:16.789
_i^(2),
sum over I.

00:11:16.789 --> 00:11:20.508
I think you guys can recognize
that as the moment of inertia

00:11:20.508 --> 00:11:22.840
with respect to the center of
mass.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.417
That's what you would do to
find the moment of inertia with

00:11:25.417 --> 00:11:28.152
respect to the center of mass.
You'll take the square of that

00:11:28.152 --> 00:11:30.465
distance.
So, the first time I get is

00:11:30.465 --> 00:11:33.940
just the I with respect
to center of mass.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:38.722
Now, I purposely want to skip
the middle term and go the last

00:11:38.722 --> 00:11:40.157
term.
In the last term,

00:11:40.157 --> 00:11:43.048
there is no sum over i
because d is a fixed

00:11:43.048 --> 00:11:45.887
vector, it doesn't have anything
to do with the particle

00:11:45.887 --> 00:11:48.008
i.
I get d.d,

00:11:48.008 --> 00:11:52.779
which is just d^(2)
times sum over all the masses,

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:57.758
which is just the total mass,
and that's part of the theorem

00:11:57.758 --> 00:12:00.879
because I got the two parts I
like.

00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:05.399
I = I_CM +
Md^(2).

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:11.090
The trouble is I got what I
want, but I got more stuff.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:15.850
I got to hope that the stuff I
don't want will go away.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.964
Okay, it's like putting a
washing machine or something,

00:12:18.964 --> 00:12:22.135
and when you're done you find
three or four parts on the

00:12:22.135 --> 00:12:24.022
ground.
You don't know why they're

00:12:24.022 --> 00:12:25.283
there.
In that case,

00:12:25.283 --> 00:12:27.909
there's no solution to that
problem.

00:12:27.909 --> 00:12:30.080
But in this problem,
there's a very nice solution.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.720
There's stuff I don't want that
is going to vanish.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.900
It's going to vanish.
And let's see why it vanishes.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.384
Let's take the cross terms.
The cross terms are like the

00:12:42.384 --> 00:12:44.720
2A.B terms.
So, here is the 2.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.940
One of the vectors A is
the vector d.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.241
And it's going to be taking the
dot product with

00:12:52.241 --> 00:12:55.402
m_ir
_i summed over

00:12:55.402 --> 00:12:59.617
i because there's going
to be a d.r_i

00:12:59.617 --> 00:13:02.145
twice.
But d is not dependent

00:13:02.145 --> 00:13:04.852
on the summation index.
It's common to all the terms in

00:13:04.852 --> 00:13:08.552
the sum and you pull it out.
Now, you can think about what

00:13:08.552 --> 00:13:11.488
this is.
This is every mass multiplied

00:13:11.488 --> 00:13:14.228
by its position.
So, take this guy,

00:13:14.228 --> 00:13:17.085
sum over i,
m_ir

00:13:17.085 --> 00:13:20.757
_i,
divide it by the total mass,

00:13:20.757 --> 00:13:23.940
and multiply it by the total
mass.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:24.330
But what is this?

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:34.663
Yep, that's the center of mass,
but that's a center of mass in

00:13:34.663 --> 00:13:39.280
a coordinate system with the
center of mass as the origin.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.897
So, you will get zero.
If I use this as the origin,

00:13:42.897 --> 00:13:44.774
take m_ir
_i,

00:13:44.774 --> 00:13:47.576
that's the center of mass.
It will have some coordinates

00:13:47.576 --> 00:13:48.879
from that origin.
But these

00:13:48.879 --> 00:13:51.842
r_i's are all
measured from the center of mass

00:13:51.842 --> 00:13:54.114
itself.
To compute the center of mass

00:13:54.114 --> 00:13:57.392
with the center of mass as your
origin of coordinates,

00:13:57.392 --> 00:13:59.943
then it's a zero.
One way to say that is if

00:13:59.943 --> 00:14:03.094
you're sitting at the center of
mass, then all the masses are

00:14:03.094 --> 00:14:06.193
surrounding the center of mass
in such a way that the way of

00:14:06.193 --> 00:14:09.029
some of the positions will be
the center of mass,

00:14:09.029 --> 00:14:12.866
but which will be then zero,
if that's your origin of

00:14:12.866 --> 00:14:15.674
coordinates.
That's the reason this will

00:14:15.674 --> 00:14:17.960
vanish.
This is a very useful result.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.100
The center of mass coordinates,
in a coordinate system with the

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.759
center of mass as the origin,
will therefore be zero,

00:14:25.759 --> 00:14:28.110
and that's why this sum
vanishes;

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.500
then, I get the result I
mentioned to you.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:35.240
I is I center of
mass + Md^(2).

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.493
And the rod was a special case
of this where I put d =

00:14:45.493 --> 00:14:48.650
L/2 to do that example.
But it's generally true.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:53.162
Okay.
One place where you might find

00:14:53.162 --> 00:14:55.710
the result useful is the
following.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:59.822
Let's think about the moment of
inertia of a coin,

00:14:59.822 --> 00:15:02.899
or a disk.
If I run the moment of inertia

00:15:02.899 --> 00:15:06.350
through the center,
I truly have to calculate it.

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:08.549
You divide it into concentric
rings.

00:15:08.549 --> 00:15:11.783
The answer for each ring is
simple, you do an integral,

00:15:11.783 --> 00:15:14.888
you get MR^(2)/2.
But suppose I say I want the

00:15:14.888 --> 00:15:16.990
moment of inertia through that
point.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:21.756
Do you know what I mean?
Stick the pin through that and

00:15:21.756 --> 00:15:23.659
rotate it.
With some wobbly motion,

00:15:23.659 --> 00:15:25.639
it will perform with that at
the center.

00:15:25.639 --> 00:15:28.836
The moment of inertia through
that point, if you just went

00:15:28.836 --> 00:15:31.079
back to basics,
is very hard to calculate

00:15:31.079 --> 00:15:34.780
because you can try your little
trick with concentric circles,

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.000
that'll be nice.
That'll be nice.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.496
Then, you'll run to the edge,
and after that,

00:15:39.496 --> 00:15:41.879
the circles are not really full
circles.

00:15:41.879 --> 00:15:45.452
And depending on how far you
go, you take different fractions

00:15:45.452 --> 00:15:48.429
of a circle, it's not easy to do
that summation.

00:15:48.429 --> 00:15:51.685
Luckily, the moment of inertia
was through the center,

00:15:51.685 --> 00:15:54.880
the whole object is divided
into concentric rings;

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.266
then, you can do the sum easily.
But here is where this theorem

00:15:59.266 --> 00:16:02.981
comes into play.
You don't have to do any more

00:16:02.981 --> 00:16:06.863
work through this point.
It is MR^(2)/2,

00:16:06.863 --> 00:16:11.379
that's the answer through the
center plus Md^(2),

00:16:11.379 --> 00:16:15.930
where d is simply the
distance from the center of mass

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:19.330
to where you set your axis.
Okay?

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:24.033
All right, so that's one
demonstration of the Parallel

00:16:24.033 --> 00:16:27.671
Axis Theorem,
of the proof of the Parallel

00:16:27.671 --> 00:16:30.812
Axis Theorem.
Now I'm going to show you a

00:16:30.812 --> 00:16:33.592
similar result,
because that's going to be also

00:16:33.592 --> 00:16:35.950
useful in the study of rigid
bodies.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.814
It has the very same flavor,
so I want to do that

00:16:38.814 --> 00:16:40.917
side-by-side.
And that's the following

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:42.662
question.
Suppose you have,

00:16:42.662 --> 00:16:45.733
in two dimensions,
a whole bunch of masses:

00:16:45.733 --> 00:16:50.340
m_1 with the
location r_1,

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.357
m_2 with a
location r_2,

00:16:52.357 --> 00:16:54.872
and they're all moving around.
You know that given all the

00:16:54.872 --> 00:16:57.073
masses that it's something,
some right here,

00:16:57.073 --> 00:16:59.070
that's the center of mass,
R.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.829
As the bodies move,
this is not a fixed situation.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:10.427
The whole--It could be a bunch
of planets traveling as seen by

00:17:10.427 --> 00:17:12.901
another galaxy.
The whole Solar System is

00:17:12.901 --> 00:17:15.488
drifting.
As the whole thing is drifting,

00:17:15.488 --> 00:17:18.583
the center of mass,
which is the weighted average

00:17:18.583 --> 00:17:21.549
of the location,
will also drift with that.

00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:26.244
Now, I want to write a formula
for the kinetic energy of this

00:17:26.244 --> 00:17:29.295
complex, which is ½,
sum over i,

00:17:29.295 --> 00:17:32.660
m_i
v_i^(2).

00:17:37.259 --> 00:17:40.227
But now, I want to look at the
velocity of this object,

00:17:40.227 --> 00:17:42.369
of every object
v_i;

00:17:42.369 --> 00:17:45.836
I want to see it as the
velocity of the center of mass,

00:17:45.836 --> 00:17:49.109
plus the velocity relative to
the center of mass,

00:17:49.109 --> 00:17:51.784
which I will denote maybe with
the symbol r for

00:17:51.784 --> 00:17:52.340
relative.

00:17:55.770 --> 00:18:00.190
Do you see that?
Every little speck is moving.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:04.029
But let's ride in a frame
moving with the center of mass.

00:18:04.029 --> 00:18:05.830
Wherever it goes,
we go with that.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.030
We latch onto it.
As seen by us,

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:12.564
the body will have a velocity
v_i relative to

00:18:12.564 --> 00:18:14.129
us,
but from the point of view of

00:18:14.129 --> 00:18:15.749
the ground, we should add to
that velocity,

00:18:15.749 --> 00:18:17.988
the velocity of the center of
mass to get the velocity with

00:18:17.988 --> 00:18:21.279
respect to the ground,
or some fixed coordinate system.

00:18:21.279 --> 00:18:26.224
So let's do that same trick
with the expansion,

00:18:26.224 --> 00:18:30.455
½ m_i.
Now, I think it will let me do

00:18:30.455 --> 00:18:32.801
this a little faster,
because we've done the thing

00:18:32.801 --> 00:18:35.644
similar to it before.
Now, I'm squaring velocities

00:18:35.644 --> 00:18:39.192
and not squaring positions.
So, one term will be this

00:18:39.192 --> 00:18:42.749
capital V,
I remind you is the velocity of

00:18:42.749 --> 00:18:45.860
the center of mass.
I just don't want to show it

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:48.558
subscript every time,
but capital V is center

00:18:48.558 --> 00:18:50.537
of mass.
So, when I squared this

00:18:50.537 --> 00:18:53.940
v_i^(2),
I'll get a V^(2) term;

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:59.152
then, I'll get a
v_i relative

00:18:59.152 --> 00:19:03.232
squared term.
Then, I'll get a cross-term

00:19:03.232 --> 00:19:07.136
twice V,
v_i relative,

00:19:07.136 --> 00:19:10.000
summed over all the particles.

00:19:14.289 --> 00:19:17.309
So, let's expand the three
terms.

00:19:17.309 --> 00:19:20.188
In the first term,
there's a velocity of center of

00:19:20.188 --> 00:19:21.980
mass;
it has nothing to do with index

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.920
I, so you can pull it out
of the sum, and what will I get?

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.529
I'll add up all the masses,
I'll get the total mass.

00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:31.509
So, I'll get the result,
½ MV^(2).

00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:36.009
That is the kinetic energy of
the center of mass.

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:37.432
In other words,
the center of mass,

00:19:37.432 --> 00:19:39.732
if it's treated as a point
containing the entire mass of

00:19:39.732 --> 00:19:41.780
the object,
moving to the velocity

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.590
V, that's the kinetic
energy of the center of mass.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:55.260
Then, let me take this term.
This is sum m_iv

00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:00.210
_i relative
squared.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:03.996
What is that?
You guys should think about

00:20:03.996 --> 00:20:05.730
what does this quantity stand
for?

00:20:11.119 --> 00:20:13.450
Can you tell me what it stands
for?

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:16.579
Yeah.
Student: The kinetic

00:20:16.579 --> 00:20:19.500
energy of the objects relative
to the center of mass?

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.793
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yeah,

00:20:20.793 --> 00:20:22.346
by that it means,
if you're really traveling with

00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:24.879
the center of mass,
and you made a measurement on

00:20:24.879 --> 00:20:28.335
how fast every body's moving,
this is the energy you will

00:20:28.335 --> 00:20:31.949
attribute to these particles.
It's not that kinetic energy as

00:20:31.949 --> 00:20:34.276
seen by somebody on the ground
who is static,

00:20:34.276 --> 00:20:36.920
but by somebody riding with the
center of mass.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:42.160
So, this is the kinetic energy
relative to center of mass.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.710
We can give it some name.
It's whatever it is.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:47.844
But once again,
the cross terms are going to

00:20:47.844 --> 00:20:49.769
vanish.
That's what I want to show you.

00:20:49.769 --> 00:20:52.440
Let's look at a cross term,
the 2 cancels the half;

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.678
then, I get this capital
V which can be pulled out

00:20:56.678 --> 00:20:59.252
of the summation,
m_iv

00:20:59.252 --> 00:21:03.869
_i relative,
summed over all the particles.

00:21:03.869 --> 00:21:07.506
m_iv
_i relative is the

00:21:07.506 --> 00:21:12.182
momentum of particle i as
seen by this co-moving observer

00:21:12.182 --> 00:21:15.299
who is moving with the center of
mass.

00:21:15.299 --> 00:21:19.530
So, this term is really sum
over i of the individual

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:23.134
momenta of the particles.
But if you go back to your

00:21:23.134 --> 00:21:27.032
notes, you'll find that sum of
the momenta of all the particles

00:21:27.032 --> 00:21:29.610
is the momentum of the center of
mass.

00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:37.767
But it is the momentum of the
center of mass as measured by a

00:21:37.767 --> 00:21:40.210
person co-moving with the center
of mass.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:43.130
So, what will that person get?
They'll get zero.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:47.779
That's the same trick as before.
For that reason this vanishes.

00:21:47.779 --> 00:21:50.309
So, don't say to me,
"How can he say the center of

00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:52.995
mass momentum is zero?"
We know the center of mass is

00:21:52.995 --> 00:21:55.132
moving.
But that is from the vantage of

00:21:55.132 --> 00:21:57.999
this person here.
But if you go and ride with the

00:21:57.999 --> 00:22:00.623
center of mass,
this is how you would compute

00:22:00.623 --> 00:22:02.890
the momentum of the center of
mass,

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:06.050
by looking at the momenta of
the fragments as seen by you;

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.528
they better add up to zero.
What it means is,

00:22:08.528 --> 00:22:11.237
if there're two masses moving
at different velocities,

00:22:11.237 --> 00:22:13.973
there're only two of them.
If you go to the center of

00:22:13.973 --> 00:22:16.866
mass, and ride with the center
of mass, whatever momentum one

00:22:16.866 --> 00:22:19.470
guy has, the other will have the
opposite momentum.

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:23.756
So, the momentum of a system
will appear to be zero as seen

00:22:23.756 --> 00:22:26.898
by the center of mass.
Okay, therefore,

00:22:26.898 --> 00:22:29.927
here is the result.
The kinetic energy of a

00:22:29.927 --> 00:22:33.019
collection of masses is the
kinetic energy that you can

00:22:33.019 --> 00:22:35.539
associate with the center of
mass motion,

00:22:35.539 --> 00:22:38.390
less kinetic energy relative to
center of mass.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:42.580
Let's just call it K
relative, but it's understood as

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.576
relative to center of mass.
This result is true no matter

00:22:46.576 --> 00:22:50.450
what I'm talking about.
Collection of loosely moving,

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:54.107
loosely connected particles.
But now, apply it to the case

00:22:54.107 --> 00:22:56.070
where these particles form a
rigid body.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.073
Think about it now.
It's not a swarm of bees,

00:23:02.073 --> 00:23:05.397
they're all connected by rigid
rods, so they form a rigid

00:23:05.397 --> 00:23:07.395
complex.
In that case,

00:23:07.395 --> 00:23:12.881
what motion is allowed,
if you ride with the center of

00:23:12.881 --> 00:23:15.170
mass?
Think about it.

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.710
What motion can you have?
Yes?

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.188
Student: Rotational.
Professor Ramamurti

00:23:20.188 --> 00:23:22.120
Shankar: It's rotational,
but you can be more specific.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.748
Rotation about which point?
Student: [inaudible]

00:23:24.748 --> 00:23:27.006
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: And was that a good

00:23:27.006 --> 00:23:28.720
guess, or was there a reason for
that?

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:34.211
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:23:34.211 --> 00:23:39.589
Shankar: Yeah,
let me repeat what he said.

00:23:39.589 --> 00:23:44.127
If you are riding with the
rigid body and you are sitting

00:23:44.127 --> 00:23:47.450
wherever the center of mass is
sitting,

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:51.847
then the only motion allowed
for you is the rotation around

00:23:51.847 --> 00:23:55.405
the center of mass.
Because if it is not around the

00:23:55.405 --> 00:23:58.323
center of mass,
then the center of mass will be

00:23:58.323 --> 00:24:01.049
moving relative to the axis of
rotation.

00:24:01.049 --> 00:24:03.544
But that's not allowed,
because according to you the

00:24:03.544 --> 00:24:06.824
center of mass is not moving;
therefore, any rotation that

00:24:06.824 --> 00:24:10.606
takes place must be around an
axis passing through the center

00:24:10.606 --> 00:24:12.255
of mass.
In that case,

00:24:12.255 --> 00:24:14.900
we know what the kinetic energy
is.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:20.232
It's ½ MV^(2) + ½
I_CM^(2) or

00:24:20.232 --> 00:24:25.170
whatever the angular velocity is
at that moment.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:30.319
So, this is the statement that
the kinetic energy is the sum of

00:24:30.319 --> 00:24:33.309
two terms, the translational
part,

00:24:33.309 --> 00:24:38.290
and the rotational part,
provided you separate it as the

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:43.180
kinetic energy of translation of
the center of mass,

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.600
and rotation relative to center
of mass.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:52.071
It's a very useful result,
because so far what we did is

00:24:52.071 --> 00:24:56.124
in the early part of the course,
we took bodies which just

00:24:56.124 --> 00:24:59.140
translate.
They are point particles;

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.670
they have a mass;
they have a velocity.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:02.309
We got used to ½ MV^(2)
as the answer.

00:25:02.309 --> 00:25:05.507
Last lecture,
we took a rigid body which has

00:25:05.507 --> 00:25:09.151
a size and a shape,
we nailed one part of it so it

00:25:09.151 --> 00:25:12.272
couldn't move,
so all it could do was rotate

00:25:12.272 --> 00:25:14.976
around a point,
and we learned that energy of

00:25:14.976 --> 00:25:18.480
rotation written somewhere there
is ½ Iω^(2).

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.843
But in reality,
a body can translate and

00:25:21.843 --> 00:25:24.530
rotate.
Throw anything you want in the

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:27.269
air, it will spin or move and
also rotate.

00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:31.716
Then the kinetic energy of that
complicated motion remarkably is

00:25:31.716 --> 00:25:34.706
the sum of two terms.
One, you ignore all the

00:25:34.706 --> 00:25:36.708
wobbling.
Just zero in on the center of

00:25:36.708 --> 00:25:38.201
mass.
Treat it like a point,

00:25:38.201 --> 00:25:40.440
and associate an energy with
its motion.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.619
Then, think of the rotation
around the center of mass,

00:25:43.619 --> 00:25:46.440
which is all that is allowed to
that [co-moving]

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.615
observer, and add that energy.
Maybe for the more

00:25:49.615 --> 00:25:53.272
mathematically-minded people,
what is interesting is if you

00:25:53.272 --> 00:25:56.731
take A + B whole squared,
there's an A^(2) term,

00:25:56.731 --> 00:25:58.630
and a B^(2) term,
and they told you,

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.060
long back, not to forget the
2AB term,

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.735
the cross term.
The fact is,

00:26:02.735 --> 00:26:06.414
the cross term always vanishes
both in that derivation and in

00:26:06.414 --> 00:26:09.121
this derivation.
It has to do with the fact that

00:26:09.121 --> 00:26:11.757
the point that I'm talking about
is not any old point,

00:26:11.757 --> 00:26:13.531
but the center of mass.
So long ago,

00:26:13.531 --> 00:26:15.175
when you learned about the
center of mass,

00:26:15.175 --> 00:26:17.180
you say, "Why did people think
of this notion?"

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:20.450
You can see repeatedly,
it's a very powerful notion.

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:23.168
But if you want to study a
rigid body, if you want to pick

00:26:23.168 --> 00:26:26.077
any one point that you want to
focus on, it's got to be center

00:26:26.077 --> 00:26:27.359
of mass.
Yes?

00:26:27.359 --> 00:26:30.381
Student: [inaudible]
is ignoring the effects of

00:26:30.381 --> 00:26:33.289
gravity of a body [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:36.490
Shankar: No.
This is kinematical statement.

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:39.570
That doesn't require that the
particles are not subject to

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:42.247
gravitational force.
They can be subject to any

00:26:42.247 --> 00:26:44.478
force, external forces,
internal forces,

00:26:44.478 --> 00:26:47.263
whatever you like.
All I've done is at a given

00:26:47.263 --> 00:26:50.137
instant, take a snapshot,
take the kinetic energy,

00:26:50.137 --> 00:26:52.190
and write it in a different
way.

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:55.550
Take the kinetic energy as seen
by a static observer,

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:59.364
and rewrite it as seen by an
observer moving with the center

00:26:59.364 --> 00:27:02.075
of mass.
So, I'm going to apply this to

00:27:02.075 --> 00:27:05.430
a simple problem so you can get
a feeling for this.

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:13.819
The simple problem is going to
be a disk.

00:27:13.819 --> 00:27:18.809
You can think of the problem as
either a disk or as a cylinder.

00:27:18.809 --> 00:27:22.090
A cylinder is just a disk with
a certain thickness.

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:25.329
So, a disk is like a coin.
The cylinder is a stack of

00:27:25.329 --> 00:27:27.495
coins.
But the moment of inertia for a

00:27:27.495 --> 00:27:30.759
disk or a cylinder is the same.
Do you guys understand that?

00:27:30.759 --> 00:27:33.779
If I took one coin,
it has got MR^(2)/2.

00:27:33.779 --> 00:27:36.424
Then, we put a second coin on
top of it and rotate them

00:27:36.424 --> 00:27:39.260
through the same axis,
then it's MR^(2)/2 for

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.779
this guy plus MR^(2)/2
for that guy.

00:27:41.779 --> 00:27:44.089
It then is equal to the total
MR^(2).

00:27:44.089 --> 00:27:48.202
For a cylinder or a disk,
the moment of inertia is just

00:27:48.202 --> 00:27:51.630
MR^(2)/2 through the
center of mass.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.769
Okay, just remember that.
Now, let's take this disk,

00:27:59.769 --> 00:28:03.859
which is sitting now and give
it some energy of motion.

00:28:03.859 --> 00:28:07.720
Think of it as a tire in a car,
one of the four tires.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.984
They're spinning.
So, there are different things

00:28:10.984 --> 00:28:14.411
you could imagine.
Lift the car off the ground in

00:28:14.411 --> 00:28:17.970
a service station,
and you let the tires spin;

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:23.801
that is rotational energy.
For that, the answer is ½

00:28:23.801 --> 00:28:27.606
Iω^(2).
That's what we've been doing

00:28:27.606 --> 00:28:30.080
all of last time.
But let's do something else.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.740
Let the tire hit the ground.

00:28:35.539 --> 00:28:38.519
And the car is going at say
50-miles-an-hour;

00:28:38.519 --> 00:28:41.136
then you slam the brakes,
so you prevent the tire from

00:28:41.136 --> 00:28:43.408
turning.
If you prevent the tire from

00:28:43.408 --> 00:28:47.157
turning, you lock the brakes,
the tire can still move with a

00:28:47.157 --> 00:28:50.829
certain velocity v,
which is just the translational

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:54.426
motion of the center of mass.
So, this is a car which is

00:28:54.426 --> 00:28:58.782
skidding, this is a tire which
is either spinning or its wheels

00:28:58.782 --> 00:29:02.699
are lifted off the ground.
They are the two simple kinds

00:29:02.699 --> 00:29:05.905
of motion you can imagine.
One is simple translation,

00:29:05.905 --> 00:29:07.920
there's no rotation to worry
about.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.637
The energy's ½ mv^(2).
Other than simple rotation,

00:29:11.637 --> 00:29:13.660
which we learned,
no translation,

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:17.328
the kinetic energy of all the
little guys are moving in the

00:29:17.328 --> 00:29:20.299
tangential direction is ½
Iω^(2).

00:29:20.299 --> 00:29:22.940
All right, in a real car both
things are happening.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:26.580
In the real car,
the tire is rolling along the

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:31.920
ground and also rotating around
the center and also translating.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.000
It's got both motions.

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:39.464
Now, the two motions,
namely the linear velocity of

00:29:39.464 --> 00:29:43.045
the center and the angular
velocity around the center in

00:29:43.045 --> 00:29:46.299
general don't have to be
connected in any way.

00:29:46.299 --> 00:29:50.829
Suppose you start your car on a
slippery road.

00:29:50.829 --> 00:29:53.869
The tire's spinning,
the car's not moving.

00:29:53.869 --> 00:29:57.930
So, that's ω equal to
not zero, but v = 0.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:00.995
Or when the car is moving along
and you slam the brake,

00:30:00.995 --> 00:30:03.890
then you kill the ω but
not the v.

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:06.026
I'm just trying to tell you,
in general, there are two

00:30:06.026 --> 00:30:08.375
velocities.
The linear motion of the center

00:30:08.375 --> 00:30:11.789
and the angular motion around
the center are independent.

00:30:11.789 --> 00:30:15.192
But one is a skidding car,
and one is a car that's

00:30:15.192 --> 00:30:18.044
spinning its wheels.
But I want to talk about the

00:30:18.044 --> 00:30:21.282
car the way we like it.
In a car that's moving the way

00:30:21.282 --> 00:30:24.926
we like it, there's a
correlation between the angular

00:30:24.926 --> 00:30:27.450
velocity and the linear
velocity.

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:29.850
And that is called "rolling
without slipping."

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.843
That's the term people use.
And when it's rolling without

00:30:37.843 --> 00:30:40.130
slipping, I think you have an
intuitive feeling.

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:43.506
If this car is to roll without
slipping on the ground,

00:30:43.506 --> 00:30:47.519
can you see that by the time it
finishes one full revolution,

00:30:47.519 --> 00:30:52.208
when it's come over here,
the center will have moved the

00:30:52.208 --> 00:30:56.130
distance equal to circumstance
of that tire.

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:58.009
So, every part of the tire
touches the ground;

00:30:58.009 --> 00:31:02.300
then, that comes down and that
comes down, and when it goes all

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.691
the way to this end,
it has also finished one full

00:31:05.691 --> 00:31:07.443
revolution.
For example,

00:31:07.443 --> 00:31:10.773
if every part of that circle
was colored with some chalk,

00:31:10.773 --> 00:31:13.450
then when it finished the full
revolution,

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:16.442
every part of the circle would
have touched the road and made

00:31:16.442 --> 00:31:18.561
an impression.
And the length of that thing

00:31:18.561 --> 00:31:20.589
should be the circumference of
the circle.

00:31:20.589 --> 00:31:23.809
That's when it rolls without
slipping.

00:31:23.809 --> 00:31:26.010
So, what does it mean to roll
without slipping?

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:28.180
What's the velocity?
But let's calculate the

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.069
velocity when you roll without
slipping.

00:31:30.069 --> 00:31:33.762
When you roll without slipping,
the velocity of the center of

00:31:33.762 --> 00:31:36.470
mass, which is always denoted by
V,

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:40.436
is equal to 2πR divided
by the time to make one full

00:31:40.436 --> 00:31:41.310
revolution.

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:49.284
But what is 2π/T?
Well, let me write it another

00:31:49.284 --> 00:31:51.401
way.
It is 2π times the

00:31:51.401 --> 00:31:54.909
frequency of revolution,
because 1/T is the

00:31:54.909 --> 00:31:58.258
frequency.
And 2πf is the angular

00:31:58.258 --> 00:32:01.080
frequency and radiance per
second.

00:32:05.779 --> 00:32:09.848
So, here is the connection
between linear velocity and

00:32:09.848 --> 00:32:13.072
angular velocity,
if you're rolling without

00:32:13.072 --> 00:32:15.190
slipping.
V = ωR.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.097
All right?
So, in general,

00:32:23.097 --> 00:32:26.376
V and ω are
independent, but rolling without

00:32:26.376 --> 00:32:28.920
slipping refers to a particular
situation.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:33.943
Now, in that case,
let's find the kinetic energy

00:32:33.943 --> 00:32:39.930
of an automobile tire that's
rolling without slipping.

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:45.285
So, what do I want to get?
The kinetic energy is ½

00:32:45.285 --> 00:32:50.500
MV^(2) + ½
Iω^(2);

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.783
that's always true.
I is always I

00:32:53.783 --> 00:32:59.883
relative to the center of mass.
But now I'm going to use the

00:32:59.883 --> 00:33:05.320
fact that it is ½ MV^(2)
+ (1/2)

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:12.359
(MR^(2)/2)ω^(2).
Not done anything different.

00:33:12.359 --> 00:33:19.003
But now, we must remember that
ωR is the velocity of

00:33:19.003 --> 00:33:22.268
the car.
So, if I do that,

00:33:22.268 --> 00:33:29.061
I find going back to this car
right here, K = ½

00:33:29.061 --> 00:33:33.589
MV^(2) + ¼
MV^(2).

00:33:33.589 --> 00:33:44.380
So, you can write it as ½
times 3M/2V^(2).

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:48.446
So, the kinetic energy of a
rotating tire is not just ½

00:33:48.446 --> 00:33:50.945
MV^(2).
If it's rolling without

00:33:50.945 --> 00:33:54.321
slipping, it's incumbent on the
tire to have some rotational

00:33:54.321 --> 00:33:57.640
energy that's correlated with
its translational energy.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:01.069
So, the total energy will be
this.

00:34:01.069 --> 00:34:03.660
But I'm going to write this in
a different way.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:10.353
Let's replace V by
ωR, so I can write it as

00:34:10.353 --> 00:34:17.400
½ times (M + M/2)
times R^(2)ω^(2).

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:26.592
And that means it's equal to ½
MR^(2) + ½

00:34:26.592 --> 00:34:32.216
MR^(2)ω^(2).
This is a lot of re-writing,

00:34:32.216 --> 00:34:35.529
so if you don't follow all the
details now, you can go back and

00:34:35.529 --> 00:34:40.760
check the intermediate steps.
But what do you notice about

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.133
this formula?
I want you to think about what

00:34:45.133 --> 00:34:48.800
the formula suggests to you.
Suggest anything?

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.510
The stuff in the brackets?
Yes?

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:57.230
Yeah?
What do you see in the brackets?

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:03.480
Student: ½ MR^(2) =
I.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:04.070
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: That is I.

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:05.679
You can be more specific than
just saying I.

00:35:05.679 --> 00:35:06.480
Student: I =
center of mass.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.679
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: That's correct.

00:35:07.679 --> 00:35:10.605
So, this term is a moment of
inertia with respect to the

00:35:10.605 --> 00:35:16.650
center of mass.
And this looks like--what now?

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:18.179
Yes, somebody in the last row.
Yes?

00:35:18.179 --> 00:35:20.761
Student: Moment of
inertia [inaudible]

00:35:20.761 --> 00:35:23.635
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: A hollow ring,

00:35:23.635 --> 00:35:26.100
but I'm having something else
in mind.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.127
Yes?
Student: The moment of

00:35:28.127 --> 00:35:30.159
inertia [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:35:30.159 --> 00:35:33.320
Shankar: Right.
Let me repeat what he said.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.503
If you will ask me,
"What's the moment of inertia

00:35:36.503 --> 00:35:39.290
of the tire with respect to this
point?"

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:43.122
What will you do?
You'll do the Parallel Axis

00:35:43.122 --> 00:35:44.702
Theorem;
it will give you

00:35:44.702 --> 00:35:48.860
MR^(2)/2 for the moment
of inertia through the center,

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.230
and an extra Md^(2)
which now becomes MR^(2).

00:35:55.969 --> 00:36:02.330
So, this is really ½ I-- what
shall we call it?

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:04.110
Road or something.
It's up to you.

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:05.750
You can call it whatever you
like.

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:07.566
There's a moment of inertia
with respect to this point of

00:36:07.566 --> 00:36:08.280
contact on the road.

00:36:12.619 --> 00:36:15.910
Now, you have to think about
this result.

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:21.114
It's a very interesting result.
It is telling you the entire

00:36:21.114 --> 00:36:27.686
energy of this tire is as though
it is rotating around this point

00:36:27.686 --> 00:36:32.382
with angular velocity ω.
Forget translation,

00:36:32.382 --> 00:36:35.110
it's a just a pure rotation
around this point.

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:38.717
Now, when it's rotating around
the point, it means that point

00:36:38.717 --> 00:36:42.304
cannot be moving.
And I will now convince you

00:36:42.304 --> 00:36:47.089
that that is actually true.
If you look at your car tire,

00:36:47.089 --> 00:36:51.199
how fast are the different
parts of the tire moving?

00:36:51.199 --> 00:36:55.599
The car as a whole is moving at
a speed V.

00:36:55.599 --> 00:36:58.176
On top of this,
the tire is spinning,

00:36:58.176 --> 00:37:01.539
so if you take a point here to
that V,

00:37:01.539 --> 00:37:04.674
you got to add an extra
tangential velocity,

00:37:04.674 --> 00:37:09.228
which is V + ωR.
That just happens to be

00:37:09.228 --> 00:37:12.150
2V.
If you come to the bottom part

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:15.175
of it, as seen by the car,
it's moving backwards at this

00:37:15.175 --> 00:37:18.378
velocity minus V.
Add to that the speed of the

00:37:18.378 --> 00:37:20.246
car, you get 0.
In other words,

00:37:20.246 --> 00:37:23.084
the top of the tire is moving
along with the car,

00:37:23.084 --> 00:37:25.449
with the same velocity as the
center.

00:37:25.449 --> 00:37:28.253
The bottom of the tire is
moving opposite to the car with

00:37:28.253 --> 00:37:31.408
the same velocity as the center,
so its real velocity is seen by

00:37:31.408 --> 00:37:34.629
the ground as zero.
So, this is a very surprising

00:37:34.629 --> 00:37:37.679
result.
A car going past you at 200 mph.

00:37:37.679 --> 00:37:41.608
There is a part of the car that
has zero velocity relative to

00:37:41.608 --> 00:37:44.478
the ground.
It's not obvious that a zooming

00:37:44.478 --> 00:37:47.670
car has one part of it that's
not moving at all.

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:51.321
It's not the same part,
otherwise the car is really not

00:37:51.321 --> 00:37:53.560
moving.
But at every instant,

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:57.598
the part of the tire that
touches the ground has zero

00:37:57.598 --> 00:38:00.474
velocity.
I hope you understand why it's

00:38:00.474 --> 00:38:04.235
a cancellation of the central
motion, of the overall motion

00:38:04.235 --> 00:38:07.546
with the rotational motion.
You can see the rotational

00:38:07.546 --> 00:38:10.070
motion on the top adds to the
speed of the car.

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:12.942
Rotational motion on the bottom
subtracts from the speed of the

00:38:12.942 --> 00:38:14.453
car.
And if you write V =

00:38:14.453 --> 00:38:17.510
ωR, the two precisely
cancel here and double there.

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:21.814
So, if the bottom point is at
rest, then the only thing the

00:38:21.814 --> 00:38:25.079
car can do is to rotate around
that point.

00:38:25.079 --> 00:38:29.097
And that's the reason why the
energy comes out to be purely

00:38:29.097 --> 00:38:31.730
rotational energy around the
center.

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:35.008
So, this is a simple problem
that illustrates all the things

00:38:35.008 --> 00:38:37.843
you have learned today:
how to use the Parallel Axis

00:38:37.843 --> 00:38:39.666
Theorem,
how to do the energy

00:38:39.666 --> 00:38:42.789
calculation, how to interpret
the energy calculation.

00:38:42.789 --> 00:38:46.740
This is useful for the
following example.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:51.465
Suppose I have a little slope.
I release an object from the

00:38:51.465 --> 00:38:53.009
top.
And I ask you,

00:38:53.009 --> 00:38:56.340
"How fast is it moving when it
comes here?"

00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:00.396
If it's a point mass and the
height is h,

00:39:00.396 --> 00:39:03.590
we know from very elementary
ideas,

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:06.879
if it's a point mass,
so don't quote me on this--If

00:39:06.879 --> 00:39:10.038
it's a point mass,
I'll say mgh has become

00:39:10.038 --> 00:39:14.159
½ mv^(2).
Kinetic potential has become

00:39:14.159 --> 00:39:18.117
kinetic.
But if it is a cylinder rolling

00:39:18.117 --> 00:39:21.591
without slipping,
and it comes here,

00:39:21.591 --> 00:39:27.548
the center of mass cannot move
at this speed because it's got

00:39:27.548 --> 00:39:31.766
to be a lower speed,
so that the rotational energy

00:39:31.766 --> 00:39:34.820
plus translation energy will add
up to mgh.

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:37.028
So, this must be equal to the
total kinetic energy,

00:39:37.028 --> 00:39:38.530
and I've solved it for you
guys.

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:41.115
You remember that.
You have to write

00:39:41.115 --> 00:39:44.967
3/2mV^(2).
This will go back to whatever

00:39:44.967 --> 00:39:47.909
was done here.
Here.

00:39:47.909 --> 00:39:51.417
So, you can see that if you
cancel the mass,

00:39:51.417 --> 00:39:55.984
you're going to get V^(2)
≠ 2gh, as you normally

00:39:55.984 --> 00:39:58.005
would.
You're going to get

00:39:58.005 --> 00:40:03.728
V^(2) = 4/3 gh.
So, it'll be moving somewhat

00:40:03.728 --> 00:40:08.896
slower than a point particle.
See, if it rolls without

00:40:08.896 --> 00:40:11.451
slipping, then you will be
traveling slower at the foot of

00:40:11.451 --> 00:40:11.990
the ramp.

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:19.110
So, what did I do?
I used the Law of Conservation

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:21.050
of Energy.
That's all I did.

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:23.981
But in finding the kinetic
energy at the bottom,

00:40:23.981 --> 00:40:27.099
I was careful to not just take
½ MV^(2).

00:40:27.099 --> 00:40:30.539
This is the energy of a point
particle, but take the kinetic,

00:40:30.539 --> 00:40:33.864
the energy of translation and
rotation, which I've done for

00:40:33.864 --> 00:40:35.789
you here.
That's the kinetic energy.

00:40:35.789 --> 00:40:37.757
The translation,
that's the kinetic energy of

00:40:37.757 --> 00:40:40.045
rotation.
By the way, don't make the

00:40:40.045 --> 00:40:44.050
mistake of thinking it is
3/4V^(2) for everything.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.030
It is 3/4V^(2) for a
cylinder.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:50.291
If it's a sphere or something,
you got to add a different

00:40:50.291 --> 00:40:52.617
thing.
But every time you will have to

00:40:52.617 --> 00:40:55.664
find a moment of inertia,
you do rotation and add to the

00:40:55.664 --> 00:40:58.600
energy of the rotation,
the energy of translation.

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:03.271
You follow that?
For each body,

00:41:03.271 --> 00:41:05.239
you'll have a different moment
of inertia.

00:41:05.239 --> 00:41:07.174
So, you've got to use,
in the place of ½

00:41:07.174 --> 00:41:09.108
mV^(2),
let me just tell you for a

00:41:09.108 --> 00:41:11.227
sphere.
If this was a sphere,

00:41:11.227 --> 00:41:15.460
not a disk, they all look the
same, but if it's a sphere,

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:19.770
this ½ mV^(2),
I think it's 2/5 MR^(2).

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:23.284
It's a different number.
But then, it's all

00:41:23.284 --> 00:41:25.818
MR^(2) times some number,
so you can take the

00:41:25.818 --> 00:41:28.699
R^(2) out of this and
turn it into V^(2).

00:41:28.699 --> 00:41:30.800
So, you will find instead of
just the mass,

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:33.599
you'll get some multiple of the
mass entering here in the

00:41:33.599 --> 00:41:36.245
kinetic energy.
And to the extent that's bigger

00:41:36.245 --> 00:41:38.652
than the mass,
the velocity will be that much

00:41:38.652 --> 00:41:41.142
slower.
So, there're all kinds of

00:41:41.142 --> 00:41:44.570
variants you can have.
Here's the variation of this

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:46.984
theme.
You remember that when you want

00:41:46.984 --> 00:41:50.151
to do the loop-d-loop,
if you release a block from

00:41:50.151 --> 00:41:53.075
here at the top,
I've shown you many times,

00:41:53.075 --> 00:41:56.532
the velocity squared has to be
bigger than or equal to

00:41:56.532 --> 00:41:58.869
Rg.
That's to make sure that it

00:41:58.869 --> 00:42:00.909
doesn't just fall down to the
track.

00:42:00.909 --> 00:42:04.414
That's the critical time at
which the track is exerting zero

00:42:04.414 --> 00:42:06.228
force.
If you went faster than that,

00:42:06.228 --> 00:42:08.489
it'll push you down and
everything will be fine.

00:42:08.489 --> 00:42:10.500
If you go slower than that,
you will fall down.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:14.106
Okay.
But now, suppose it's not a

00:42:14.106 --> 00:42:19.312
point mass, but an object like a
coin or a disk rolling without

00:42:19.312 --> 00:42:22.311
slipping.
It is still true V^(2)

00:42:22.311 --> 00:42:24.989
at least has to be equal to
Rg,

00:42:24.989 --> 00:42:28.166
but to find the V^(2)
here, you will use the Law of

00:42:28.166 --> 00:42:31.309
Conservation of Energy.
That's all just fine.

00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:34.346
The potential energy here will
be mg times 2R,

00:42:34.346 --> 00:42:37.022
the potential energy here is
mg times R

00:42:37.022 --> 00:42:40.110
[correction: should have written
h not R].

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:43.639
Just don't make the mistake of
saying the kinetic energy is ½

00:42:43.639 --> 00:42:46.070
mv^(2) and put V^(2) =
Rg.

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:48.928
That would be wrong.
This m here may become

00:42:48.928 --> 00:42:51.960
3/4 or 9/7 or whatever it is for
that body.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.401
So, it's the same idea,
but you can add more and more

00:42:55.401 --> 00:42:59.769
ideas and put them together and
make a more interesting problem.

00:42:59.769 --> 00:43:03.803
But if I were to summarize in
one sentence what I have told

00:43:03.803 --> 00:43:07.547
you all of this time is that,
when rigid bodies move,

00:43:07.547 --> 00:43:10.929
they have a translational and
rotational energy.

00:43:10.929 --> 00:43:13.522
In general, they're independent
numbers, but when you have

00:43:13.522 --> 00:43:16.325
rolling without slipping,
the angular velocity and the

00:43:16.325 --> 00:43:18.969
linear velocity are connected in
this fashion.

00:43:18.969 --> 00:43:22.811
So, it's not surprising that
the total energy has got a

00:43:22.811 --> 00:43:26.207
contribution from both,
which you can write either in

00:43:26.207 --> 00:43:29.219
terms of the angular velocity or
the linear velocity.

00:43:29.219 --> 00:43:31.046
In other words,
if I know how fast the wheel is

00:43:31.046 --> 00:43:33.190
spinning, I can tell you how
fast the car is moving.

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:36.045
If I tell you how fast the car
is moving, I know the rate at

00:43:36.045 --> 00:43:38.949
which the wheels are spinning,
provided it's not skidding.

00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:40.770
If it's skidding,
these bets are off.

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:49.650
All right, so now we continue
with this saga of rotations.

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:53.969
And let me remind you where we
stand.

00:43:53.969 --> 00:43:57.444
When I did F = ma after
telling you a little bit about

00:43:57.444 --> 00:43:59.934
how mass is measured,
and everybody knew how

00:43:59.934 --> 00:44:02.539
acceleration is measured,
what did we do?

00:44:02.539 --> 00:44:05.506
We first took a bunch of
problems where some forces are

00:44:05.506 --> 00:44:07.903
acting on a body.
Maybe something's pulling,

00:44:07.903 --> 00:44:10.557
something's pushing,
then we learned how to find the

00:44:10.557 --> 00:44:14.324
acceleration.
Then, I took other cases where

00:44:14.324 --> 00:44:20.289
there are many bodies exerting a
mutual force on each other.

00:44:20.289 --> 00:44:23.177
Then, if there are no external
forces, we saw the total

00:44:23.177 --> 00:44:25.210
momentum of the system is
concerned.

00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:29.428
We're going to do analogous
things with our newfound

00:44:29.428 --> 00:44:34.454
equation of τ = Iα.
You want to get used to this

00:44:34.454 --> 00:44:37.034
more.
That's all I'm going to do from

00:44:37.034 --> 00:44:38.964
now on.
I already told you the

00:44:38.964 --> 00:44:42.538
beginning, the new thing you
learned was τ = Iα,

00:44:42.538 --> 00:44:44.390
and we're going to use it.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:51.410
So, let's take various
situations where we can do this.

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:54.712
Let me take a simple example.
You can make up your own

00:44:54.712 --> 00:44:57.010
problem, doesn't matter,
but get practice.

00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:00.806
One possibility is:
here is a disk like a

00:45:00.806 --> 00:45:04.340
merry-go-round.
It's sitting still.

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:06.667
It's got a mass,
it's got a radius,

00:45:06.667 --> 00:45:10.631
and I want to apply a torque.
So, one way to apply the torque

00:45:10.631 --> 00:45:13.395
is the way kids do.
You know, you grab this end and

00:45:13.395 --> 00:45:15.815
you run with it on the side;
as you run with it,

00:45:15.815 --> 00:45:18.252
it picks up speed,
but what you're trying to do is

00:45:18.252 --> 00:45:20.590
apply a tangential force as long
as you can.

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:23.368
And the force times the
distance will turn into a

00:45:23.368 --> 00:45:25.239
torque.
And that'll produce angular

00:45:25.239 --> 00:45:27.539
acceleration.
Another way to do that if

00:45:27.539 --> 00:45:30.929
you're really high-tech is to
buy yourself a rocket;

00:45:30.929 --> 00:45:33.469
it's got some flames coming
here.

00:45:33.469 --> 00:45:36.781
Then, if you just put one
rocket, the danger--What do you

00:45:36.781 --> 00:45:39.620
think the danger is,
if you just put one of these

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:40.330
rockets?

00:45:44.039 --> 00:45:45.780
You know what the problem may
be?

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:47.480
It'll certainly exert a torque.
Yes?

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.730
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:49.469
Shankar: Yeah,
because,

00:45:49.469 --> 00:45:51.423
look, there will be
translational motion left to

00:45:51.423 --> 00:45:52.920
itself, because that is the
force.

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.280
And F = ma has not gone
away just because we're in

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.159
chapter 11;
that's still true.

00:45:58.159 --> 00:46:01.024
So, what'll happen is,
this pivot point is trying to

00:46:01.024 --> 00:46:02.989
hold the merry-go-round in
place.

00:46:02.989 --> 00:46:05.572
They're putting a lot of force
on it, because it'll try to

00:46:05.572 --> 00:46:07.316
move.
It has to counter the force at

00:46:07.316 --> 00:46:09.737
every instant.
As long as the merry-go-round

00:46:09.737 --> 00:46:11.738
doesn't fly off,
what'll happen is,

00:46:11.738 --> 00:46:14.269
that the rocket's emitting gas
this way,

00:46:14.269 --> 00:46:16.806
and applying a force that way,
the pivot will apply an

00:46:16.806 --> 00:46:18.821
opposite force.
And as the rocket goes there,

00:46:18.821 --> 00:46:21.059
it'll apply an opposite force
in the other direction.

00:46:21.059 --> 00:46:23.880
But to spare this pivot this
unwanted agony,

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:26.570
what you do is you get a second
rocket,

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:31.318
similar thrust,
put it diametrically opposite,

00:46:31.318 --> 00:46:35.750
and have its flames going out
like this.

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:38.483
So, when you buy a rocket,
they will tell you,

00:46:38.483 --> 00:46:41.400
"This rocket has a thrust of so
many Newtons."

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:46.880
That's the force it will exert
by emitting the gas.

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.880
So, if it got a certain thrust,
F here.

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:52.360
You got another rocket the same
thrust, F here.

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.442
The radius is r,
the torque you're applying is

00:46:55.442 --> 00:46:58.880
an F times r times
sine of 90, which is 1.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.579
And another F times
r from the other guy,

00:47:01.579 --> 00:47:04.990
and the two torques are added.
That'll be the torque.

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:08.083
Then, the rest is very easy.
What's the angular acceleration

00:47:08.083 --> 00:47:10.962
of this guy?
It is 2Fr divided by the

00:47:10.962 --> 00:47:13.833
moment of inertia,
which in this case is

00:47:13.833 --> 00:47:16.409
MR^(2)/2,
if it's a disk.

00:47:16.409 --> 00:47:20.429
What if I put some passengers
on this?

00:47:20.429 --> 00:47:24.780
Suppose I put one lone
passenger here on some mass;

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:28.760
let me call it little m.
Then what happens?

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:34.429
Would you like to guess?
Yep.

00:47:34.429 --> 00:47:35.829
Student: Yeah,
if you add the moment of

00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:36.979
inertia at a distant point
[inaudible]

00:47:36.979 --> 00:47:38.409
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Right,

00:47:38.409 --> 00:47:42.340
so what you'll add to the
denominator?

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:44.840
Student: Would that be
mR^(2)?

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:45.719
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes.

00:47:45.719 --> 00:47:47.209
Student: It's not
something that I [inaudible]

00:47:47.209 --> 00:47:48.526
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: That's also

00:47:48.526 --> 00:47:50.850
correct.
So, my picture is wrong.

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:54.919
Sorry for this one.
This r should be capital

00:47:54.919 --> 00:47:57.182
R.
And let's use for this mass

00:47:57.182 --> 00:48:00.440
here, small r;
then, there's small r^(2).

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:04.097
Capital R is the symbol
I want to use for--oh,

00:48:04.097 --> 00:48:06.010
my God!
This is a nightmare!

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:08.280
I have to change it in so many
places.

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:12.820
I guess once I started down
this road, I have to do that.

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:15.306
Okay, so look,
it's very natural that big

00:48:15.306 --> 00:48:18.663
R is the disk radius,
and small r is some

00:48:18.663 --> 00:48:21.516
point inside.
But I was not planning to put

00:48:21.516 --> 00:48:25.110
this guy in the platform,
so I just used a random symbol.

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:28.715
Does everybody understand now?
For the moment of computation,

00:48:28.715 --> 00:48:31.453
it's the radius of the disk.
For the moment of inertia of

00:48:31.453 --> 00:48:33.889
the little person we put on this
little r^(2).

00:48:33.889 --> 00:48:38.100
Okay, so that's the simplest
example of using τ =

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:41.277
Iα.
Once the rockets start burning,

00:48:41.277 --> 00:48:44.806
you got this α.
I can ask you things like,

00:48:44.806 --> 00:48:48.200
"How many degrees has it
rotated after 19 seconds?"

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.865
And you should know what to do.
θ = θ_0 +

00:48:52.865 --> 00:48:56.650
ω_0t + ½
αt^(2).

00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:58.400
θ_0 you can
choose to be zero.

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.380
Initial angular velocity was
zero.

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:03.699
Just ½ αt^(2).
But α is this.

00:49:03.699 --> 00:49:06.238
You put the number of seconds
they gave you,

00:49:06.238 --> 00:49:09.250
that'll tell you how many
degrees it has rotated.

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:11.776
By that time you can say,
"How many revolutions has it

00:49:11.776 --> 00:49:15.720
made?
Then, what will you do?"

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:18.380
Yes?
Any idea?

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:20.388
Yep?
Student: Divide

00:49:20.388 --> 00:49:21.159
[inaudible]
by 2π.

00:49:21.159 --> 00:49:22.395
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Divide by

00:49:22.395 --> 00:49:23.940
2π because 2π is
one full revolution.

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:26.880
These are things you must know.
Okay, then, if I say,

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.239
what's the angle of velocity
after 36 seconds?

00:49:30.239 --> 00:49:32.310
Well, there's α times
36.

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:36.100
These are simple problems.
So now, I'm going to do a

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:38.679
slightly more complicated
problems.

00:49:38.679 --> 00:49:41.980
Here is the first complication
you can have.

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:48.099
There is a pulley,
and there is a mass.

00:49:48.099 --> 00:49:50.989
I better get everything right
here.

00:49:50.989 --> 00:49:55.285
This is--Let's call it little
m, let's call the radius

00:49:55.285 --> 00:50:01.409
R, and mass big M.
And I just let go of the mass.

00:50:01.409 --> 00:50:03.141
And the question is,
"What's the acceleration of

00:50:03.141 --> 00:50:03.620
this mass?"

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:11.425
So, there's a combination of
rotational problems and

00:50:11.425 --> 00:50:13.275
translation.
The mass is translating,

00:50:13.275 --> 00:50:16.236
the pulley is rotating.
And the point is,

00:50:16.236 --> 00:50:20.050
what's the acceleration of this
mass?

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:24.431
So, we know from the old days
that if you want to find what's

00:50:24.431 --> 00:50:27.610
happening with the mass,
you should draw free-body

00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:30.480
diagram with a downward force
mg, and some tension

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:31.710
T on the rope.

00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:38.226
Then, you must also draw a
free-body diagram for the

00:50:38.226 --> 00:50:41.629
pulley.
When you look at the free-body

00:50:41.629 --> 00:50:45.793
diagram for the pulley,
our tension T,

00:50:45.793 --> 00:50:49.561
is acting down here.
Have I drawn all the forces on

00:50:49.561 --> 00:50:50.929
this?
Yep?

00:50:50.929 --> 00:50:54.280
Student: [inaudible]
pulley in place?

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:54.929
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Right.

00:50:54.929 --> 00:50:58.730
So, this pivot point is going
to apply some force.

00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:02.683
Basically, what it has to do is
to overcome the weight of this

00:51:02.683 --> 00:51:05.469
mass, and overcome this tension
T.

00:51:05.469 --> 00:51:07.770
But I'm not going to bother to
write that.

00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:10.369
I'll tell you why.
So, this is an incomplete

00:51:10.369 --> 00:51:12.502
picture.
There is something else here

00:51:12.502 --> 00:51:16.025
but I won't pay any attention to
it because I'm going to use

00:51:16.025 --> 00:51:18.289
τ = Iα,
and I'm going to take the

00:51:18.289 --> 00:51:21.244
torque through the center.
And this is something that'll

00:51:21.244 --> 00:51:24.477
come over and over again.
If you take a torque through a

00:51:24.477 --> 00:51:26.936
certain point,
the forces acting through that

00:51:26.936 --> 00:51:28.973
point,
they don't get to contribute

00:51:28.973 --> 00:51:31.767
because in the formula for
torque, Fr sin θ,

00:51:31.767 --> 00:51:34.013
r vanishes,
and the forces don't do

00:51:34.013 --> 00:51:36.088
anything.
That's why I don't pay any

00:51:36.088 --> 00:51:38.000
attention to what the pivot is
doing.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.855
This T is trying to
rotate it this way,

00:51:40.855 --> 00:51:44.409
and I know that T times
R is the torque,

00:51:44.409 --> 00:51:49.909
and that's going to be
MR^(2)/2 times α.

00:51:49.909 --> 00:51:54.150
But α is the angular
acceleration of this guy.

00:51:54.150 --> 00:52:01.180
For the mass,
it is mg - T = ma.

00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:10.840
So, let's go and cancel one
power of R here.

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:14.878
But we seem to have two
unknowns in this problem:

00:52:14.878 --> 00:52:18.863
the tension T -- sorry,
three unknowns -- the

00:52:18.863 --> 00:52:21.818
acceleration a,
and the tangential angular

00:52:21.818 --> 00:52:24.679
acceleration α,
of the pulley.

00:52:24.679 --> 00:52:28.263
But here is where you do the
trick you did even with the two

00:52:28.263 --> 00:52:29.964
masses.
They're not independent

00:52:29.964 --> 00:52:32.073
accelerations,
because if this point has an

00:52:32.073 --> 00:52:35.518
angular acceleration α,
you can see that point has a

00:52:35.518 --> 00:52:38.809
tangential acceleration of
R times α.

00:52:38.809 --> 00:52:42.091
That has to be the acceleration
of this mass also,

00:52:42.091 --> 00:52:46.309
because the rope is being given
out at a certain rate and that's

00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:48.726
the same.
So, the mass can go one inch

00:52:48.726 --> 00:52:52.040
only if the pulley turns by a
corresponding amount to release

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.504
one more inch.
So, the tangential velocity of

00:52:54.504 --> 00:52:56.739
the point here is the velocity
of the mass.

00:52:56.739 --> 00:52:59.117
The acceleration of that
contact point is the

00:52:59.117 --> 00:53:03.317
acceleration of this.
Therefore, you have to use the

00:53:03.317 --> 00:53:07.211
fact that a = Rα;
a is really what I

00:53:07.211 --> 00:53:09.820
called a-tangential in
the first lecture.

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:13.115
So, if you do that,
you can see that this R

00:53:13.115 --> 00:53:15.469
times α is just
a.

00:53:15.469 --> 00:53:18.440
This combination becomes
a.

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:23.403
Now, I'm ready to add these two
equations, -T and

00:53:23.403 --> 00:53:27.554
+T cancel,
giving me mg = a times

00:53:27.554 --> 00:53:29.450
(m + M/2).

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:40.198
So, we can get the acceleration.
So, the acceleration is

00:53:40.198 --> 00:53:43.880
gm divided by m +
M/2.

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:53.753
So, does it make sense?
When you get a calculation like

00:53:53.753 --> 00:53:55.360
this, you can test it in many
ways.

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:58.373
First, if the pulley is
massless, capital M

00:53:58.373 --> 00:54:01.099
vanishes;
forget it downstairs.

00:54:01.099 --> 00:54:03.220
Cancel little m with
little m and you get a

00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:04.970
= g;
that's the correct answer.

00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:06.120
It's just falling down freely.

00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:16.489
Now, I'm going to subject it to
another stringent test.

00:54:16.489 --> 00:54:22.463
Suppose I ask you--Suppose it's
got a distance h through

00:54:22.463 --> 00:54:25.959
which it can fall.
How fast is the block moving

00:54:25.959 --> 00:54:30.489
when it hits the ground?
Just before it hits the ground,

00:54:30.489 --> 00:54:34.517
what's the velocity?
So, you have to think about

00:54:34.517 --> 00:54:37.059
what ideas you'd invoke to do
that.

00:54:37.059 --> 00:54:43.030
Is the acceleration constant,
first of all?

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:47.698
Yes?
Gentleman in the back said

00:54:47.698 --> 00:54:50.081
"yes."
Anybody know if it's constant

00:54:50.081 --> 00:54:52.342
or variable?
How many people think it's

00:54:52.342 --> 00:54:55.840
constant?
Okay.

00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:58.460
See, I don't know what you guys
are thinking.

00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:01.398
So, I'm always worried whether
your silence means that you have

00:55:01.398 --> 00:55:03.862
no idea what I'm saying,
or it's so obvious you don't

00:55:03.862 --> 00:55:06.059
want to tell me.
Now, that's going to happen in

00:55:06.059 --> 00:55:08.446
a class with 100 people.
It's very unfortunate,

00:55:08.446 --> 00:55:12.117
it'd be a lot nicer if I had 10
people and I can stop and ask

00:55:12.117 --> 00:55:14.007
each one of you.
But I ask you,

00:55:14.007 --> 00:55:16.553
if you don't follow something,
you got to tell me,

00:55:16.553 --> 00:55:18.579
because otherwise I just don't
know.

00:55:18.579 --> 00:55:22.722
So, if a is constant,
and a lot of you seem to agree

00:55:22.722 --> 00:55:26.151
a is constant,
then you go back to lecture

00:55:26.151 --> 00:55:28.369
number 0.
What did we find?

00:55:28.369 --> 00:55:31.283
v^(2) is
v_0^(2),

00:55:31.283 --> 00:55:35.216
which is 0, plus 2a
times the distance traveled,

00:55:35.216 --> 00:55:38.130
which in our case would be
h.

00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:43.970
So, let's put that in.
2a is this number here.

00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:50.665
m + M/2 times h.
So, I'm going to write it in a

00:55:50.665 --> 00:55:55.629
very suggestive language as
[2/(m

00:55:55.629 --> 00:56:00.119
+M/2)] times
mgh.

00:56:00.119 --> 00:56:04.402
Anyway, that's the square of
the velocity when the block hits

00:56:04.402 --> 00:56:07.085
the ground.
So, what do you think I'm

00:56:07.085 --> 00:56:10.380
trying to test now?
What's my goal?

00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:12.510
Any idea where I'm going with
this?

00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:16.952
Yeah?
Student: Because it's

00:56:16.952 --> 00:56:20.575
moving slower when it hits the
ground, and it has less kinetic

00:56:20.575 --> 00:56:24.197
energy, that means that energy
is stored in rotational kinetic

00:56:24.197 --> 00:56:25.269
energy.
Professor Ramamurti

00:56:25.269 --> 00:56:27.432
Shankar: That is correct.
But if I wanted to test this,

00:56:27.432 --> 00:56:29.970
if I wanted to subject this
answer to a test,

00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:32.449
what test do you think I can
apply here?

00:56:32.449 --> 00:56:36.600
This has to meet a certain
requirement.

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:38.412
Yep?
Student: You want to

00:56:38.412 --> 00:56:40.341
show that energy is conserved.
Professor Ramamurti

00:56:40.341 --> 00:56:42.270
Shankar: I want to show that
the energy is conserved.

00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:44.599
There is no friction;
nothing in this problem.

00:56:44.599 --> 00:56:46.937
So, if you wanted to say energy
is conserved,

00:56:46.937 --> 00:56:50.631
we know what we want.
We want mgh has to be

00:56:50.631 --> 00:56:54.250
the kinetic energy of all these
objects.

00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:56.860
Right?
So, I go to my answer;

00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:59.860
here is mgh.
Let's send all the other stuff

00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:03.623
to the left-hand side.
If I do that,

00:57:03.623 --> 00:57:16.090
I get (m/2)v^(2) + ½
(M/2) v^(2) = mgh.

00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:19.620
All I've done guys is to
transfer this fellow to the

00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:23.630
other side.
Well, mgh is wonderful!

00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:25.120
That's my initial potential
energy;

00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.400
there is no kinetic energy;
nobody was moving.

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.050
This is clearly the kinetic
energy of the mass.

00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:33.588
And the last thing is,
this is the kinetic energy of

00:57:33.588 --> 00:57:36.110
the pulley.
I think by now you recognize

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:38.539
this is the kinetic energy of
the pulley.

00:57:38.539 --> 00:57:41.942
If you're not convinced,
I can replace this v by

00:57:41.942 --> 00:57:45.030
ωR, and bring the
R^(2) in here,

00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:48.054
and write this last term as ½
[1/4]

00:57:48.054 --> 00:57:52.373
MR^(2)ω^(2),
which is the kinetic energy of

00:57:52.373 --> 00:57:54.895
the pulley.
So, you got to understand the

00:57:54.895 --> 00:57:57.345
linear velocity of the mass and
the angular velocity of the

00:57:57.345 --> 00:57:59.673
pulley are connected.
And the connection factor's

00:57:59.673 --> 00:58:01.964
always R.
R is the number that

00:58:01.964 --> 00:58:04.079
connects linear to angular
quantities.

00:58:04.079 --> 00:58:07.120
So indeed, this answer
satisfies the Law of

00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:10.489
Conservation of Energy.
That's a very good test.

00:58:10.489 --> 00:58:15.599
Now, you can have variations of
this problem.

00:58:15.599 --> 00:58:17.260
I don't want to do too many
variations.

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:19.278
In fact, I'm just going to draw
it in the corner of the board,

00:58:19.278 --> 00:58:20.469
and I don't feel like pursuing
it,

00:58:20.469 --> 00:58:24.138
because there is a limit to how
many things can be done in the

00:58:24.138 --> 00:58:26.279
class.
So, here is a pulley,

00:58:26.279 --> 00:58:30.193
and here is a mass.
And you guys can work out the

00:58:30.193 --> 00:58:33.170
accelerations of the mass down
here.

00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:36.789
It's the same story that I did
here, okay?

00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:39.570
You got to draw the free-body
diagram of the mass;

00:58:39.570 --> 00:58:42.245
you're going to draw the
free-body diagram of the pulley,

00:58:42.245 --> 00:58:44.586
and you're going to say,
"The net force on this is

00:58:44.586 --> 00:58:46.649
bringing it down.
The net torque on this is

00:58:46.649 --> 00:58:48.312
turning it."
And you'll realize that the

00:58:48.312 --> 00:58:50.331
a of this and the
α of this are not

00:58:50.331 --> 00:58:52.514
independent,
but that the a of the

00:58:52.514 --> 00:58:55.531
block is related to the
α of the pulley by this

00:58:55.531 --> 00:58:57.180
factor;
then, you'll be home.

00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:59.380
Things will just work out.

00:59:02.409 --> 00:59:04.110
And it will of course depend on
this angle θ.

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:11.327
Suppose you did the
calculation, and you wanted to

00:59:11.327 --> 00:59:15.030
subject that to a test.
What can you do?

00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:22.940
Yeah?
Student: Well,

00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:25.273
you can still raise the
[inaudible]

00:59:25.273 --> 00:59:28.429
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: There is no

00:59:28.429 --> 00:59:31.107
friction,
so what he's saying is you can

00:59:31.107 --> 00:59:33.340
use the Law of Conservation of
Energy.

00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:35.197
For example,
if there's dropped a certain

00:59:35.197 --> 00:59:37.519
height h,
from that height to the ground,

00:59:37.519 --> 00:59:40.328
your answer should satisfy the
condition that mgh was

00:59:40.328 --> 00:59:43.185
equal to the kinetic energy of
the mass and the pulley at the

00:59:43.185 --> 00:59:45.860
end of the day,
and your answer will satisfy it.

00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:49.519
Another thing you can do is if
this angle θ goes to 90

00:59:49.519 --> 00:59:52.566
degrees, look what happens.
If θ goes to 90,

00:59:52.566 --> 00:59:55.234
forget about the block,
it is just falling freely,

00:59:55.234 --> 00:59:57.139
and that's the previous
problem.

00:59:57.139 --> 01:00:00.047
You can check if the answer you
get agrees with the previous

01:00:00.047 --> 01:00:02.763
problem.
So, I'm just teaching you that

01:00:02.763 --> 01:00:06.469
it's good to have constant
checks on the problem.

01:00:06.469 --> 01:00:08.789
One way to check the
calculation is to go back and do

01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:10.101
it again.
Most of the time,

01:00:10.101 --> 01:00:12.905
if you screw it up the first
time, you'll probably screw up

01:00:12.905 --> 01:00:15.708
the second time because one of
the basic rules of nature is

01:00:15.708 --> 01:00:18.269
that if you repeat a certain
experiment under the same

01:00:18.269 --> 01:00:20.909
conditions,
you'll get the same answer.

01:00:20.909 --> 01:00:23.049
That's why when I proofread
anything, I write,

01:00:23.049 --> 01:00:26.090
I don't find any mistakes.
But my readers are gleefully

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:29.878
pointing out this and that typo,
because we cannot detect those

01:00:29.878 --> 01:00:31.561
errors.
That's true even for a

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:34.113
scientific calculation.
Because for some reason you

01:00:34.113 --> 01:00:37.136
forgot something the first time,
you'll keep making the same

01:00:37.136 --> 01:00:39.272
mistake.
That is known in the business

01:00:39.272 --> 01:00:42.714
as "chasing after π."
In all the calculations we do,

01:00:42.714 --> 01:00:45.980
we look at the right answer,
and we look at our answer,

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:48.519
and we take the ratio it's
always 3.14;

01:00:48.519 --> 01:00:50.929
so, we know somewhere we lost
the π.

01:00:50.929 --> 01:00:53.905
It's called "chasing after
π," and "chasing after

01:00:53.905 --> 01:00:57.252
factors of 2," is roughly how I
spend 80 percent of my time when

01:00:57.252 --> 01:01:00.138
I'm debugging something.
So, how do you beat those

01:01:00.138 --> 01:01:02.320
things is by all these extreme
limits.

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.909
That's another thing I want to
tell you with this.

01:01:05.909 --> 01:01:08.445
All of us are partial to
working these things with

01:01:08.445 --> 01:01:11.471
symbols and not with numbers.
I think it's a big issue in

01:01:11.471 --> 01:01:14.352
Introductory Physics.
There's a resistance to working

01:01:14.352 --> 01:01:16.723
with symbols.
People want to know what's the

01:01:16.723 --> 01:01:18.610
mass M.
What's the number R?

01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:21.125
Let me put that in.
If you put numbers in too

01:01:21.125 --> 01:01:23.840
early, you cannot test your
answer for anything.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.539
In the end you just got a
number.

01:01:25.539 --> 01:01:27.889
You cannot take the limit of
one particular number.

01:01:27.889 --> 01:01:30.813
But if you got a function that
depends on all the parameters,

01:01:30.813 --> 01:01:32.908
you can vary them and in some
extreme limit,

01:01:32.908 --> 01:01:34.760
you would know what the answer
is.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.680
That's why you should be ready,
even in the exam;

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.960
that's not a secret.
I will tell you right now,

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.809
most of the problems I give,
you will work with symbols.

01:01:42.809 --> 01:01:46.790
Now, I don't know why it's
harder working with symbols.

01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:49.488
For me, it's just the opposite.
Once I put numbers in,

01:01:49.488 --> 01:01:51.350
I don't know what the number
stands for.

01:01:51.350 --> 01:01:53.012
What is it?
But if I call it M,

01:01:53.012 --> 01:01:54.421
if I call it R,
if I call it G,

01:01:54.421 --> 01:01:57.133
I know what it stands for.
So, you guys have to get used

01:01:57.133 --> 01:02:01.070
to, even in a homework problem
where numbers were given to you.

01:02:01.070 --> 01:02:04.630
A block of mass 46 kg,
collides with some elephant.

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:08.070
First, call them all 1,2, 3.
Give them masses,

01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:10.270
solve the equation,
then put the numbers in.

01:02:10.270 --> 01:02:13.720
That's what I would recommend.
Anyway, I think you can see

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:16.769
here the advantage of working
with symbols.

01:02:16.769 --> 01:02:21.767
Okay, so what I have done now,
I took examples of τ =

01:02:21.767 --> 01:02:23.941
Iα.
In all the problems I did,

01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:26.110
something had a torque and it
was spinning.

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:29.322
The torque either came from the
rockets, or it came from the

01:02:29.322 --> 01:02:32.099
pull of this mass,
or from the pull of this mass.

01:02:32.099 --> 01:02:37.184
Now, I'm going to take a subset
of problems, in nature,

01:02:37.184 --> 01:02:40.762
where the torque,
the total torque on a

01:02:40.762 --> 01:02:46.719
collection of bodies is zero.
So, I'm going to take a system.

01:02:46.719 --> 01:02:49.669
There are many torques,
but the external torque,

01:02:49.669 --> 01:02:52.995
due to forces outside the
things forming the system is

01:02:52.995 --> 01:02:55.370
zero;
then, you remember when the

01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:59.126
external forces vanished,
then the momentum of the system

01:02:59.126 --> 01:03:00.917
was the same.
P_1 +

01:03:00.917 --> 01:03:02.473
P_2 =
P_1 prime,

01:03:02.473 --> 01:03:05.044
+ P_2 prime.
So, here you will find

01:03:05.044 --> 01:03:07.163
L_1 +
L_2,

01:03:07.163 --> 01:03:10.107
or L_3,
any number of them will be

01:03:10.107 --> 01:03:11.765
conserved.
In other words,

01:03:11.765 --> 01:03:14.764
in the absence of external
torques, the angular momentum of

01:03:14.764 --> 01:03:17.144
the system is conserved.
That means it has the same

01:03:17.144 --> 01:03:17.410
value.

01:03:21.559 --> 01:03:30.660
Angular momentum is conserved
if τ-external is zero.

01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:37.245
That's like saying linear
momentum is conserved if the

01:03:37.245 --> 01:03:40.789
external force is zero.
So, let's take some examples of

01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:42.639
this.
Here's one example.

01:03:42.639 --> 01:03:47.090
There is a disk on a spindle
that's spinning around.

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:50.196
The disk has some moment of
inertia I_1,

01:03:50.196 --> 01:03:53.469
spinning at some angle of
velocity ω_1.

01:03:53.469 --> 01:04:00.032
On top of this is a second
disk, just one millimeter away,

01:04:00.032 --> 01:04:03.700
and it's at rest.
And it's got some moment of

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:06.991
inertia I_2,
but it's got the same center as

01:04:06.991 --> 01:04:09.513
this guy.
And then, this one falls on

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:12.550
that one, and the question is
what happens?

01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:16.300
So, I think we all know what
happens.

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:20.117
We all know the two will now
stick together and rotate as a

01:04:20.117 --> 01:04:23.079
single unit with a common
angular velocity.

01:04:23.079 --> 01:04:26.973
So, the Law of Conservation of
Angular Momentum will say,

01:04:26.973 --> 01:04:30.310
I_1ω
_1 for the first

01:04:30.310 --> 01:04:34.203
guy plus 0 for the second guy is
now = I_1 +

01:04:34.203 --> 01:04:37.610
I_2 times my final
ω.

01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:41.980
So, it's a trivial thing to
solve for ω.

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:46.110
This should remind you of the
following problem in

01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:49.373
translational motion.
There is a body sitting at

01:04:49.373 --> 01:04:52.070
rest, m_1,
or m_2.

01:04:52.070 --> 01:04:54.369
There's a body
m_1 coming at a

01:04:54.369 --> 01:04:57.737
speed v_1.
They stick together and travel

01:04:57.737 --> 01:04:59.380
as a unit.
What happens?

01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:02.014
Then, we say the initial
momentum is the momentum of

01:05:02.014 --> 01:05:03.873
m_1 +
m_2,

01:05:03.873 --> 01:05:08.224
traveling at some final speed.
It's identical to that with the

01:05:08.224 --> 01:05:12.410
usual dictionary for translating
quantities here.

01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:17.743
Okay.
Now, let's take a slightly more

01:05:17.743 --> 01:05:21.910
interesting problem.
The merry-go-round is spinning.

01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:25.924
I'm seeing it from the top.
It's got some angle of velocity

01:05:25.924 --> 01:05:28.762
I_1.
I mean, angle of momentum,

01:05:28.762 --> 01:05:30.611
I_1ω
_1,

01:05:30.611 --> 01:05:33.409
because of moment of inertia
and angular velocity.

01:05:33.409 --> 01:05:36.926
This is the top view,
and I dropped a piece of

01:05:36.926 --> 01:05:39.710
chewing gum on it.
What happened?

01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:42.368
It's very simple.
The chewing gum and the thing

01:05:42.368 --> 01:05:45.662
will start rotating together.
The new moment of inertia you

01:05:45.662 --> 01:05:48.409
should use here,
would be just MR^(2).

01:05:48.409 --> 01:05:50.648
I think people seem to know
that if you stick a point of

01:05:50.648 --> 01:05:52.155
mass on a disk,
the extra contribution

01:05:52.155 --> 01:05:53.580
MR^(2),
it'll slow down.

01:05:57.190 --> 01:06:00.090
Remember, these are problems in
which there are no external

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:02.218
torques.
One disk, this disk is speeding

01:06:02.218 --> 01:06:03.899
up that disk,
slowing--I'm sorry,

01:06:03.899 --> 01:06:06.520
this is speeding that up,
and that is slowing this,

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:08.500
but together they cannot change
the total;

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:11.805
that's the whole point.
What if this putty,

01:06:11.805 --> 01:06:14.772
or chewing gum,
was not just dropped,

01:06:14.772 --> 01:06:18.727
but shot from the site like
this, with some speed

01:06:18.727 --> 01:06:22.650
v_0?
It's got some mass m.

01:06:22.650 --> 01:06:24.720
This guy is radius R,
big M.

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:30.137
Now what happens?
This is something that may not

01:06:30.137 --> 01:06:32.794
be obvious to you.
A putty that's traveling and

01:06:32.794 --> 01:06:35.280
then comes and lands and sticks
to it.

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:39.429
What's the difference now?
Yep?

01:06:39.429 --> 01:06:41.878
Student: The distance
and [inaudible]

01:06:41.878 --> 01:06:44.440
apply a force to stop the
motion of a body.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.300
So, that's the torque.
Professor Ramamurti

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:48.130
Shankar: Very good.
Excellent.

01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:50.948
So, let me repeat what he said.
This moving chewing gum has to

01:06:50.948 --> 01:06:53.280
be brought to rest [in the frame
of the disk].

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.265
It'll be brought to rest by the
disk that'll push it backwards,

01:06:56.265 --> 01:06:59.010
and the chewing gum will push
it forward, so it'll apply a

01:06:59.010 --> 01:07:00.739
torque.
That means it'll change the

01:07:00.739 --> 01:07:03.104
angular momentum.
But instead of going through

01:07:03.104 --> 01:07:06.289
that route of finding the
torque, if I only knew the angle

01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:09.224
of momentum of this putty,
then that will add it to the

01:07:09.224 --> 01:07:11.276
angle of momentum of the disk.
Then, I say,

01:07:11.276 --> 01:07:14.159
that's the total angular
momentum that should not change.

01:07:14.159 --> 01:07:16.803
So, the question is,
"What's the angular momentum of

01:07:16.803 --> 01:07:19.965
a mass that's not really moving
in a circle, but that's moving

01:07:19.965 --> 01:07:22.557
in a straight line?"
And the answer is:

01:07:22.557 --> 01:07:25.999
pretend that it's part of a
circle right there,

01:07:25.999 --> 01:07:29.332
moving at this velocity.
What will be its angular

01:07:29.332 --> 01:07:30.723
momentum?
In other words,

01:07:30.723 --> 01:07:33.760
if you are the moving putty,
and you look to your left,

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:36.826
the disk is spinning,
and you are going at a certain

01:07:36.826 --> 01:07:40.372
speed, at that instant you are
not distinguishable from another

01:07:40.372 --> 01:07:42.889
body that's actually orbiting
the center.

01:07:42.889 --> 01:07:47.092
But what will be the relation
of your velocity to your angular

01:07:47.092 --> 01:07:49.196
velocity?
Where your tangential velocity

01:07:49.196 --> 01:07:51.575
is v_0,
your angular velocity will be

01:07:51.575 --> 01:07:53.550
v_0 divided by
R.

01:07:53.550 --> 01:07:55.598
At that instant,
that'll be your angular

01:07:55.598 --> 01:07:58.120
velocity because somebody will
be looking at you,

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.590
you'll be there now,
you'll be there later.

01:08:00.590 --> 01:08:03.739
Your θ will change.
And the angular velocity will

01:08:03.739 --> 01:08:08.229
be v_0/R.
Your angular momentum will be

01:08:08.229 --> 01:08:13.859
mR^(2) times ω,
which you can write as

01:08:13.859 --> 01:08:18.840
mR^(2) times
v_0/R,

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:21.739
which becomes
mv_0R,

01:08:21.739 --> 01:08:26.330
which I would like to write as
p times R,

01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:30.208
where p is the usual momentum.
So, when a body comes with a

01:08:30.208 --> 01:08:33.884
tangential momentum p,
and it plants itself on the

01:08:33.884 --> 01:08:35.922
disk,
it actually is an angular

01:08:35.922 --> 01:08:37.980
momentum p times
R.

01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:41.668
This is not very surprising.
Just like R times

01:08:41.668 --> 01:08:44.161
F gives the force,
R times p gives

01:08:44.161 --> 01:08:46.933
the angular momentum.
So, the surprising thing for

01:08:46.933 --> 01:08:50.498
you guys is, things don't have
to be going around in a circle

01:08:50.498 --> 01:08:53.768
to have an angular momentum.
They can be going in a straight

01:08:53.768 --> 01:08:56.440
line, but at every instant,
I can find the angular momentum

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:58.637
by asking,
"What's the moment of inertia,

01:08:58.637 --> 01:09:00.927
namely MR^(2),
and what's the angular

01:09:00.927 --> 01:09:03.642
velocity?"
The angular velocity is easiest

01:09:03.642 --> 01:09:06.840
to find when this guy is right
next to the disk.

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:10.072
You know from what we did
earlier, angular velocity is

01:09:10.072 --> 01:09:12.390
linear velocity divided by
R.

01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:15.916
Okay, the last problem that I
want to do, which I'm not going

01:09:15.916 --> 01:09:18.795
to do quantitatively,
but qualitatively is a very,

01:09:18.795 --> 01:09:22.661
very interesting problem.
Go to a single particle in

01:09:22.661 --> 01:09:26.899
translational motion,
whose momentum is mv.

01:09:26.899 --> 01:09:30.568
And we know if there are no
forces, the momentum cannot

01:09:30.568 --> 01:09:33.840
change.
So, mv is a constant.

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:39.149
Now, that translates into
v is a constant.

01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:42.420
Because m is a constant,
there's nothing you can do.

01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:46.533
Now come the interesting
possibilities that are available

01:09:46.533 --> 01:09:51.587
to you when you do rotations.
That's the famous Icecapade

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:55.091
example, okay?
So, let me do the Icecapade

01:09:55.091 --> 01:09:57.840
thing.
So, here is ice,

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.780
here is some dancer.

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:08.113
All right.
This person is spinning around

01:10:08.113 --> 01:10:11.859
with some velocity ω
with her hands out.

01:10:11.859 --> 01:10:15.790
To emphasize the whole thing,
let's imagine this ice dancer

01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:19.855
has no mass, except for the two
dumbbells on the two hands or

01:10:19.855 --> 01:10:21.550
the two masses,
okay?

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:25.520
And the person is rotating with
some angular velocity ω.

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:29.770
That means the angular momentum
is I times ω.

01:10:29.770 --> 01:10:34.334
And that cannot change.
But then, suppose the ice

01:10:34.334 --> 01:10:38.744
dancer decides to do the
following, which is to drop the

01:10:38.744 --> 01:10:43.636
arms right to the side so that
for all purposes the mass is at

01:10:43.636 --> 01:10:46.836
the center now.
You really reduce the moment of

01:10:46.836 --> 01:10:49.520
inertia.
So, what'll happen?

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:53.279
So, I will signify that angular
velocity;

01:10:53.279 --> 01:10:55.739
she got her hair is kind of
standing out.

01:10:55.739 --> 01:11:02.324
It's a rapidly spinning
ballerina, and that's because

01:11:02.324 --> 01:11:07.709
what is changing is I.
If bodies could change their

01:11:07.709 --> 01:11:10.805
mass, it'll be very interesting.
If a body can reduce its mass

01:11:10.805 --> 01:11:12.560
in half, it can double the
velocity.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.939
But bodies have no way of
getting rid of their mass.

01:11:14.939 --> 01:11:18.178
If bodies can change their
moment of inertia just by

01:11:18.178 --> 01:11:21.659
redistributing the mass.
And that's why all these ice

01:11:21.659 --> 01:11:23.946
dancers, you know,
they spin around,

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:26.560
then they bring their hands
together.

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:28.541
Then, they speed up and slow
down, and they speed up,

01:11:28.541 --> 01:11:31.389
then they slow down.
What is interesting is the

01:11:31.389 --> 01:11:34.296
following.
If you go back and find the

01:11:34.296 --> 01:11:37.189
kinetic energy,
you'll find the kinetic

01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:40.920
energy's not the same because
kinetic energy is ½

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:44.909
Iω^(2) to begin with.
It is ½ I_1,ω

01:11:44.909 --> 01:11:47.162
_1^(2).
At the end of the day,

01:11:47.162 --> 01:11:50.149
it's ½ I_2,
ω_2^(2),

01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:54.190
but ω_2 can
be written as I_1

01:11:54.190 --> 01:11:57.409
/I_2ω
_1^(2).

01:11:57.409 --> 01:12:01.125
And you can easily compare the
two numbers in the geometry I've

01:12:01.125 --> 01:12:04.240
given you to show the final
kinetic energy's actually

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:08.772
higher.
When you start spinning faster,

01:12:08.772 --> 01:12:13.770
in fact, the bigger the kinetic
energy.

01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:17.446
Because if your ω
doubles because your moment of

01:12:17.446 --> 01:12:21.390
inertia went down by a factor of
half, that keeps Iω

01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:23.851
constant.
But you're supposed to square

01:12:23.851 --> 01:12:25.552
the ω,
so in the product

01:12:25.552 --> 01:12:28.349
Iω^(2),
when you reduce one by half and

01:12:28.349 --> 01:12:30.800
double the other,
you gain a factor of 2.

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.603
So, take the simple case where
I_2 is half of

01:12:33.603 --> 01:12:35.579
I_1 and you
will see it.

01:12:35.579 --> 01:12:42.816
Okay, so you can ask,
"Where does that energy come

01:12:42.816 --> 01:12:46.463
from?
How does this ice skater pick

01:12:46.463 --> 01:12:51.420
up speed, pick up angular
momentum or kinetic energy?"

01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:53.633
The angular momentum doesn't
change, but the rotational

01:12:53.633 --> 01:12:56.619
energy changes.
Yep?

01:12:56.619 --> 01:13:01.880
Student: I got like sort
of potential angular energy.

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.198
Is that sort of [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

01:13:04.198 --> 01:13:06.659
Shankar: You can do this
without invoking any new

01:13:06.659 --> 01:13:08.409
concepts, using this old
concept.

01:13:08.409 --> 01:13:10.925
You just go back and say,
"Look, I know only one rule in

01:13:10.925 --> 01:13:12.746
this game."
If the energy went up,

01:13:12.746 --> 01:13:14.010
then what?
Yes.

01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:16.236
Student: The system
itself is performing work on

01:13:16.236 --> 01:13:17.680
different elements of the
system.

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:20.521
So that work is increasing but
[inaudible]

01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:24.056
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: But who is doing

01:13:24.056 --> 01:13:26.635
work?
Student: The skater is

01:13:26.635 --> 01:13:30.750
doing work by bringing together
the dumbbell she's carrying.

01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:31.912
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yeah,

01:13:31.912 --> 01:13:32.899
and why does that take any
work?

01:13:32.899 --> 01:13:35.916
Because if gravity is pulling
you down, you're moving

01:13:35.916 --> 01:13:38.873
perpendicular to gravity,
so why are you--you got an

01:13:38.873 --> 01:13:41.579
answer in the last row?
Yes?

01:13:41.579 --> 01:13:45.770
Student: Doing work
against gravity.

01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:46.875
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No,

01:13:46.875 --> 01:13:48.214
but see, you're not doing work
against gravity,

01:13:48.214 --> 01:13:49.990
because you're not changing the
height of those barbells.

01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:52.260
You're just pulling it in.
Yes?

01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:54.671
Student: When you pull,
you have a difference in

01:13:54.671 --> 01:13:56.967
potential energy.
You have less potential energy

01:13:56.967 --> 01:13:58.774
when you're holding it up.
Professor Ramamurti

01:13:58.774 --> 01:13:59.440
Shankar: No,
no, but oh.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.390
Oh, I see.
I am sorry.

01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:02.820
I know why you guys are giving
those answers.

01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:05.574
It's not your fault.
Take the case where you don't

01:14:05.574 --> 01:14:07.330
change the height of the
dumbbells;

01:14:07.330 --> 01:14:10.869
go from there to here.
Not changing the height.

01:14:10.869 --> 01:14:12.360
So, the mgh is not the
answer.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:18.966
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

01:14:18.966 --> 01:14:27.800
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes.

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:31.350
Student: Energy comes
from the muscles.

01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:32.891
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: It comes from the

01:14:32.891 --> 01:14:34.729
muscles, but the question is why
do you have to do any work?

01:14:34.729 --> 01:14:38.095
And I think since I'm running
out of time, I will repeat that

01:14:38.095 --> 01:14:41.461
answer, which I believe is close
enough to what I was looking

01:14:41.461 --> 01:14:43.196
for.
When the dumbbells are

01:14:43.196 --> 01:14:45.359
spinning, they're going in a
circle.

01:14:45.359 --> 01:14:48.139
And we know that they have an
acceleration v^(2)/R,

01:14:48.139 --> 01:14:50.869
and we know somebody's got to
provide mv^(2)/R,

01:14:50.869 --> 01:14:52.909
and the person is providing
that force.

01:14:52.909 --> 01:14:56.323
But as long as she's providing
the force, but not moving,

01:14:56.323 --> 01:14:59.229
you can move tangentially.
But the force and velocity are

01:14:59.229 --> 01:15:01.029
perpendicular,
so you're not doing any work.

01:15:01.029 --> 01:15:04.814
But the minute you pull in,
you're applying a force and a

01:15:04.814 --> 01:15:07.449
displacement which are both
parallel.

01:15:07.449 --> 01:15:10.841
Then F times d is
no longer 0, you will find that

01:15:10.841 --> 01:15:12.810
these things are going to fly
off,

01:15:12.810 --> 01:15:14.637
as he said, and you're trying
to not only hold on to them,

01:15:14.637 --> 01:15:16.472
but trying to bring them in.
During that time,

01:15:16.472 --> 01:15:18.319
it'll be just like lifting
weights.

01:15:18.319 --> 01:15:20.761
If you want to lift weights,
and you go to a planet where

01:15:20.761 --> 01:15:22.962
there is no gravity,
tell somebody to spin you,

01:15:22.962 --> 01:15:25.494
then when you pull the stuff
in, it'll be like lifting

01:15:25.494 --> 01:15:27.199
weights,
okay?

01:15:27.199 --> 01:15:30.281
That's what the person's doing,
and that's where the energy's

01:15:30.281 --> 01:15:31.281
coming from.

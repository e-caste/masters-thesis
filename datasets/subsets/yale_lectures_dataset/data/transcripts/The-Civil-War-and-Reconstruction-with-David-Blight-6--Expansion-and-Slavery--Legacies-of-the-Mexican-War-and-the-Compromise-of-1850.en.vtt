00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.501
Professor David Blight:
If you haven't noticed,

00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:19.740
at the back of my edition of
Douglass's narrative,

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.360
which is the one I'm hoping you
are using--.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:38.253
Come on down, in, quickly.
Anyway, if you haven't noticed,

00:00:38.253 --> 00:00:44.531
at the back of this edition of
Douglass's narrative there are

00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:49.240
not only a variety of ancillary
documents,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.880
Douglass's greatest speech is
also included.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.067
A word on that.
It's Douglass's 4^(th) of July

00:00:58.067 --> 00:01:00.962
Speech.
If you've never read it,

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:04.471
you should read it.
It is the rhetorical

00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:07.046
masterpiece of American
abolitionism,

00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:11.340
one of the greatest works of
oratory in American history.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.561
It was Frederick Douglass as
Beethoven on steroids,

00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:17.250
but with language.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.580
It's like a symphony in three
movements;

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.610
I say that in a little
head-note introduction to it.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.452
He gave that speech in 1852.
I may refer to it at the end of

00:01:34.452 --> 00:01:37.810
this lecture,
depending on the time.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.736
It is all about the crisis that
has gripped the country in the

00:01:41.736 --> 00:01:45.638
wake of the Compromise of 1850,
in the midst of this expansion

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:48.720
of slavery into the West,
and the way it has begun to

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.209
tear apart America's political
culture.

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:55.181
And on the 4^(th) of July,
amidst his friends in

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:59.490
Rochester, New York,
he's invited to give the 4^(th)

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.079
of July oration.
He says "thank you very much."

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.069
The invitation was from the
Ladies Anti-Slavery Society of

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.780
Rochester, New York,
many of whom were his friends.

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.807
He gave the address in the
house of his friends,

00:02:17.807 --> 00:02:21.370
Corinthian Hall in Rochester,
600 people in the audience;

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.569
double, more than double your
numbers.

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.995
Read that speech because it's
as if Douglass,

00:02:29.995 --> 00:02:35.326
after that first opening,
gentle introduction where he

00:02:35.326 --> 00:02:41.361
sets his audience at ease about
the greatness of the Founding

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:44.826
Fathers,
the genius of the Declaration

00:02:44.826 --> 00:02:48.585
of Independence--he calls it the
ring-bolt of American

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:51.655
independence,
the ring-bolt of American

00:02:51.655 --> 00:02:54.045
identity.
He just makes them feel good

00:02:54.045 --> 00:02:55.200
about the founders.

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.373
And then it's as if he has a
staff bolting the doors around

00:03:02.373 --> 00:03:05.910
the hall, and then he's got a
staff riveting people into their

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.256
seats,
puts metaphorical seatbelts on

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:13.130
them and says,
"you won't move until I rain

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.650
Hell down on you for the next
twenty minutes."

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.580
Which is what he did.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.462
And he says,
in effect--he says more than in

00:03:26.462 --> 00:03:30.340
effect, he says it
directly--"why have you invited

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.060
me to speak to you on your
Fourth of July?"

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.697
And he just rains the pronouns
on them: you,

00:03:35.697 --> 00:03:36.877
you, you, you,
your, your, your,

00:03:36.877 --> 00:03:38.319
your.
"The Fourth of July is yours

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.824
and not mine;
you may rejoice,

00:03:39.824 --> 00:03:42.090
I must mourn," and on and on he
goes.

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.719
And then there's the moment,
one of the most brilliant

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:53.270
rhetorical moments in American
letters,

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.909
in my view, certainly in
abolitionist writing,

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.520
where he doesn't even announce
his text to his well rooted

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.300
Biblical audience,

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.027
and he says,
after raining down on them this

00:04:10.027 --> 00:04:12.360
long passage about--"the Fourth
of July is yours,

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.063
you may rejoice,
I must mourn,

00:04:14.063 --> 00:04:17.586
to drag a man in fetters into
the grand illuminated temple of

00:04:17.586 --> 00:04:21.110
liberty and call upon him to
join you in joyous anthems,

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.000
is inhuman mockery," he says.
And then he just floats,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.600
without announcing his text,
into the 137^(th) Psalm.

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.634
And he simply reads:
"By the rivers of Babylon there

00:04:37.634 --> 00:04:41.285
we sat down.
Yea, we wept when we remembered

00:04:41.285 --> 00:04:44.087
Zion.
We hanged our harps upon the

00:04:44.087 --> 00:04:48.906
willows in the midst thereof,
for there they that carried us

00:04:48.906 --> 00:04:52.009
away captive required of us a
song,

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.341
and they who wasted us required
of us mirth, saying 'sing us one

00:04:55.341 --> 00:04:59.449
of the songs of Zion.'
How can we sing the Lord's song

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.310
in a strange land?
If I forget thee O Jerusalem,

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.478
let my right hand forget her
cunning, if I do not remember

00:05:07.478 --> 00:05:11.500
thee, let my tongue cleave to
the roof of my mouth."

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.050
What has Douglass just done to
his friendly audience?

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.949
He's used one of the most
famous passages in the Bible.

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.939
His audience would've known
that passage.

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:25.019
People wouldn't today,
in most circles.

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:30.920
"By the rivers of Babylon,
there we sat down."

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.165
We were the captives from Egypt
and he said, you made us sing

00:05:36.165 --> 00:05:39.784
for you.
And in effect he is saying to

00:05:39.784 --> 00:05:44.610
them, "I'll sing for you but you
may not like it."

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.094
That was Douglass's--and he did
it hundreds of times

00:05:50.094 --> 00:05:56.546
elsewhere--it was Douglass's
most brilliant expression of--or

00:05:56.546 --> 00:06:02.354
critique of--this American
hypocrisy about freedom in a

00:06:02.354 --> 00:06:06.695
land of slavery.
A lot of people were worried

00:06:06.695 --> 00:06:08.530
about this contradiction.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.042
It was Douglass as well in the
midst of the Mexican War--which

00:06:17.042 --> 00:06:19.470
is what we're about today--in
1847,

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.491
in the midst of that
expansionist war,

00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:26.329
where at least modest numbers
of northerners,

00:06:26.329 --> 00:06:28.915
certainly abolitionists,
opposed it because they saw it

00:06:28.915 --> 00:06:30.829
as a war for the expansion of
slavery.

00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:35.408
It was Douglass who said
America is a nation of

00:06:35.408 --> 00:06:39.489
inconsistencies,
completely made up of its

00:06:39.489 --> 00:06:41.480
inconsistencies.

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:47.156
But you know,
the young Abraham Lincoln had

00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:50.050
always been worried about this
very same question.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.276
He comes at it from a different
perspective, he comes at it from

00:06:54.276 --> 00:06:56.490
different experiences,
largely.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.750
He's never going to be an
abolitionist.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.722
But his very first public
address, The Young Men's Lyceum

00:07:03.722 --> 00:07:06.986
speech of 1838,
the first public address that a

00:07:06.986 --> 00:07:11.261
young Abraham Lincoln ever gave,
in the middle of it is this

00:07:11.261 --> 00:07:14.831
quite remarkable passage where
it's as though he's almost

00:07:14.831 --> 00:07:18.656
predicting--we don't want to
give him too much credit for his

00:07:18.656 --> 00:07:22.545
predictions--but it's almost as
if he's predicting this crisis

00:07:22.545 --> 00:07:26.433
that we're now about to try to
understand for the next several

00:07:26.433 --> 00:07:29.603
weeks.
"At what point," said Lincoln

00:07:29.603 --> 00:07:33.649
in this speech way back,
in 1838, "At what point shall

00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:38.077
we expect the approach of danger
and by what means shall we

00:07:38.077 --> 00:07:39.910
fortify against it?

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:47.686
Shall we expect"--we here is
this American nation--"Shall we

00:07:47.686 --> 00:07:52.204
expect some trans-Atlantic
military giant to step over the

00:07:52.204 --> 00:07:57.500
ocean and crush us at a blow?"
He answers, "Never.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.379
All the armies of Europe,
Asia and Africa combined,

00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:04.250
with all the treasure of the
earth,

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:10.012
could not by force take a drink
from the Ohio River or make a

00:08:10.012 --> 00:08:13.470
track on the Blue Ridge
Mountains,

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.950
in a trial of 1000 years.

00:08:19.009 --> 00:08:25.133
If destruction is to be our lot
we must ourselves be its author

00:08:25.133 --> 00:08:29.273
and its finisher.
As a nation of free men we must

00:08:29.273 --> 00:08:32.340
live through all time or die by
suicide."

00:08:38.009 --> 00:08:44.633
He doesn't say what that
problem in the midst would be,

00:08:44.633 --> 00:08:49.540
directly, but he's already
implied it.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:57.009
What is civil war?
A kind of collective suicide.

00:08:57.009 --> 00:08:59.173
Now, briefly,
and I'm going to put the

00:08:59.173 --> 00:09:02.741
Underground Railroad story off
until after we do the aftermath

00:09:02.741 --> 00:09:05.490
and the collapse of the
Compromise of 1850.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.620
Oh, I just predicted it would
collapse, sorry about that.

00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:16.532
But this anti-slavery impulse
that does take hold in the

00:09:16.532 --> 00:09:20.110
American North went through
various stages.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:23.481
That first stage is the 1830s
into the 1840s,

00:09:23.481 --> 00:09:27.848
which is largely a time of
great expansion in abolitionist

00:09:27.848 --> 00:09:29.917
organizations,
in societies,

00:09:29.917 --> 00:09:33.125
in newspapers.
It tends to be a decade,

00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:36.265
decade and a half,
driven largely by a kind of

00:09:36.265 --> 00:09:39.615
Garrisonian--and I outlined the
various tenets of

00:09:39.615 --> 00:09:43.943
Garrisonianism--but it tended to
be a kind of Garrisonian moral

00:09:43.943 --> 00:09:47.135
suasion.
This was an era in which most

00:09:47.135 --> 00:09:50.759
abolitionists were largely
devoted to this idea of

00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:55.049
reforming or changing the heart
of the American people.

00:09:55.049 --> 00:09:59.971
This was driven very much by
the kind of evangelical second

00:09:59.971 --> 00:10:04.722
great awakening impulse of
changing the conscience of the

00:10:04.722 --> 00:10:08.525
American people;
indeed, just changing the

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:11.809
conscience of the slaveholder
himself.

00:10:11.809 --> 00:10:15.863
A second stage of American
anti-slavery impulse-there's no

00:10:15.863 --> 00:10:19.632
single moment when it
begins--but that second stage is

00:10:19.632 --> 00:10:23.815
essentially a political stage.
It begins largely with the

00:10:23.815 --> 00:10:26.803
birth of the Liberty Party,
as it was called,

00:10:26.803 --> 00:10:29.148
in 1837,
the first attempt at an

00:10:29.148 --> 00:10:33.248
anti-slavery political party,
founded by some pretty serious

00:10:33.248 --> 00:10:36.762
abolitionists.
These people were the real

00:10:36.762 --> 00:10:39.280
thing.
They're going to run James G.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.257
Birney for President a couple
of times, and they got miniscule

00:10:43.257 --> 00:10:45.669
numbers of almost countable
votes.

00:10:45.669 --> 00:10:48.429
James G.
Birney who had been born in

00:10:48.429 --> 00:10:53.079
Alabama, a former slaveholder
who moves north and becomes an

00:10:53.079 --> 00:10:59.009
abolitionist.
His symbol was quite remarkable.

00:10:59.009 --> 00:11:03.052
That Liberty Party will morph,
in the 1840s,

00:11:03.052 --> 00:11:07.000
after its record of very little
success,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.089
into--especially in the midst
of this Mexican War--what became

00:11:10.089 --> 00:11:13.440
known as the Free Soil Party,
by 1848.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.990
And we'll pick up the Free
Soilers here in a few minutes.

00:11:19.049 --> 00:11:21.408
The Free Soil Party--as it was
founded in 1848,

00:11:21.408 --> 00:11:23.870
directly in response to this
expansionist war,

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:27.222
with Mexico--was a party
largely devoted,

00:11:27.222 --> 00:11:30.994
by its very title,
to keeping the West free of

00:11:30.994 --> 00:11:34.436
slavery;
a political impulse to try to

00:11:34.436 --> 00:11:38.720
keep America's future free of
slave labor systems.

00:11:43.049 --> 00:11:46.057
But what's really going on here
is a shift out of the moral

00:11:46.057 --> 00:11:49.065
suasionist impulses of early
abolitionists to a learning of

00:11:49.065 --> 00:11:50.310
the art of politics;

00:11:54.009 --> 00:11:57.008
of engaging a larger political
culture with the nation's

00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:59.689
greatest issues.
And it is of course when

00:11:59.689 --> 00:12:03.939
abolitionism--or an anti-slavery
impulse is what I want to it

00:12:03.939 --> 00:12:06.462
call here,
because these are not

00:12:06.462 --> 00:12:10.889
necessarily rabid abolitionists
that become Free Soilers,

00:12:10.889 --> 00:12:14.940
nor who become the Republicans
after 1854.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.259
But it is a fear of slavery--a
fear of its power,

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:23.039
a fear of its denigration of
free labor,

00:12:23.039 --> 00:12:27.746
a fear of the way slavery as a
system could control America's

00:12:27.746 --> 00:12:31.765
future--that becomes,
especially in the wake of the

00:12:31.765 --> 00:12:36.349
Mexican War, front and center
the greatest political issue in

00:12:36.349 --> 00:12:38.853
America.
Now how did we get a Mexican

00:12:38.853 --> 00:12:41.264
War?
Now I don't know if you know

00:12:41.264 --> 00:12:45.116
much about the war with Mexico.
We speed right over it in a lot

00:12:45.116 --> 00:12:50.857
of American history classes.
But after the annexation--time

00:12:50.857 --> 00:12:53.790
for some maps,
yes.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:08.334
I think that's visible, mostly.
Well after the annexation of

00:13:08.334 --> 00:13:14.365
Cuba in-- Texas in 1836--the
South was always trying to annex

00:13:14.365 --> 00:13:16.150
Cuba,
four times before the Civil

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:17.529
War, I can't get that out of my
head.

00:13:17.529 --> 00:13:22.444
But after the annexation of
Texas, by the United States,

00:13:22.444 --> 00:13:27.269
and Texas became a state--so
said the United States,

00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:32.231
after 1836--Texas was to be
that great Western territory,

00:13:32.231 --> 00:13:35.704
seemingly limitless.
Its western border had never

00:13:35.704 --> 00:13:37.736
been determined.
For that matter,

00:13:37.736 --> 00:13:41.679
a southern border with Mexico
had never been negotiated.

00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:45.023
The United States just took
Texas and said,

00:13:45.023 --> 00:13:47.585
"well;
we'll figure out its boundaries

00:13:47.585 --> 00:13:48.809
later.
Oh, by the way,

00:13:48.809 --> 00:13:50.390
Mexico--we'll let them know."

00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:58.182
Mexico never accepted the Rio
Grande as a border between the

00:13:58.182 --> 00:14:01.963
United States and Mexico--never.
They assumed if there was a

00:14:01.963 --> 00:14:05.725
border with this first
independent Republic of Texas,

00:14:05.725 --> 00:14:09.850
and now State of Texas,
it was to be the Nueces River.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:15.748
Can you see the Nueces River?
Not very visible but it's up

00:14:15.748 --> 00:14:20.220
here.
Oh, my hand's not too steady.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:25.367
Anyway, the Rio Grande was
never accepted as the border by

00:14:25.367 --> 00:14:29.692
Mexico;
but that's never stopped wars

00:14:29.692 --> 00:14:34.899
of conquest before,
and why would it then?

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:39.340
Now, just to give you a bigger
sense of this story.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:44.333
We've already talked a lot
about how the westward expansion

00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:49.241
of a slave society and the
westward expansion of the South

00:14:49.241 --> 00:14:55.009
was just booming from the 1820s
through the '30s into the '40s.

00:14:55.009 --> 00:14:57.244
And there was a deep and
abiding assumption in

00:14:57.244 --> 00:14:59.379
America--and we call it Manifest
Destiny.

00:14:59.379 --> 00:15:02.760
At the time not everybody was
walking around mouthing the

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.068
phrase Manifest Destiny.
People didn't meet in bars and

00:15:06.068 --> 00:15:08.734
taverns and say,
"What do you think of Manifest

00:15:08.734 --> 00:15:11.942
Destiny?"
But they spoke a language of

00:15:11.942 --> 00:15:15.890
inevitability,
they spoke a kind of racialism

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.748
about what needs to be done,
should be done,

00:15:19.748 --> 00:15:24.992
has been done about Indians.
And the Indian removal policies

00:15:24.992 --> 00:15:28.525
under Jackson of the 1830s did
indeed, of course,

00:15:28.525 --> 00:15:33.300
remove: Indian removal.
I have a whole map of that.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:38.269
I love my maps.
This one's cool.

00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:40.440
But, of course,
it's a brutal story.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.090
The five great tribes,
sometimes called the civilized

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:47.110
tribes of the American
South--the Creeks,

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.090
the Chickasaw,
the Choctaw,

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.679
the Cherokee,
and the Seminole from

00:15:51.679 --> 00:15:55.204
Florida--were,
indeed, between the early 1830s

00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:58.817
and the late-1830s removed,
by and large--not all the

00:15:58.817 --> 00:16:02.570
Seminoles--but removed out west
to what became Oklahoma

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:06.740
Territory or it was originally
called Indian Territory.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.604
But that Indian removal was in
great--was part and parcel of

00:16:11.604 --> 00:16:16.221
opening up this southern
frontier to expansion and to the

00:16:16.221 --> 00:16:21.333
possibilities now of the cotton
boom and the development of the

00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:25.138
greatest,
as we've said now more than

00:16:25.138 --> 00:16:29.419
once, source of wealth in the
United States.

00:16:29.419 --> 00:16:32.789
Now, the presidential election
of 1844.

00:16:32.789 --> 00:16:36.031
James K.
Polk, the Democrat,

00:16:36.031 --> 00:16:41.795
a kind of hard money successor
to Andrew Jackson,

00:16:41.795 --> 00:16:48.398
avid expansionist and a
slave-owning cotton planter from

00:16:48.398 --> 00:16:52.460
Tennessee,
got elected President.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.539
They called him Young Hickory
instead of Old Hickory.

00:16:56.539 --> 00:16:59.314
He ran against Henry Clay,
who ran for President,

00:16:59.314 --> 00:17:01.626
three, four,
five times, depending on how

00:17:01.626 --> 00:17:06.184
many times you count them,
in the antebellum years,

00:17:06.184 --> 00:17:10.074
as will Daniel Webster.
But Henry Clay,

00:17:10.074 --> 00:17:14.474
essentially the intellectual or
ideological founder of the Whig

00:17:14.474 --> 00:17:18.195
Party, ran as the Whig.
Clay, too, ran on an

00:17:18.195 --> 00:17:23.917
expansionist platform of a kind,
but the Whigs tended to argue

00:17:23.917 --> 00:17:28.630
for expansionism by negotiation.
We were going to negotiate

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.490
treaties of expansion,
we were going to negotiate our

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.944
way into the southwest,
we were going to negotiate the

00:17:34.944 --> 00:17:38.241
British out of the northwest.
Polk said:

00:17:38.241 --> 00:17:43.579
"negotiation--bullshit," is what
he said.

00:17:43.579 --> 00:17:47.549
"Elect me and I will give you
Mexico, elect me and I will give

00:17:47.549 --> 00:17:50.190
you Oregon."
And he did.

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.743
It was a close election.
Polk won by only about 36,000

00:17:53.743 --> 00:17:57.220
votes, out of about 2.8 million
cast.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:01.595
He barely won New York state,
a Democratic stronghold,

00:18:01.595 --> 00:18:05.309
in part because of immigration
to New York,

00:18:05.309 --> 00:18:08.291
and he carried,
therefore, New York's 36

00:18:08.291 --> 00:18:13.553
electoral votes and was elected.
The Liberty Party of James G.

00:18:13.553 --> 00:18:18.420
Birney got 16,000 votes in
1844, most of them in about

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.910
three counties in upstate New
York.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:26.940
They didn't cause a lot of
ruckus, but they existed.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:31.283
Now, just before Tyler,
John Tyler, left office as a

00:18:31.283 --> 00:18:36.819
lame duck he pushed through the
annexation of Texas as a state.

00:18:36.819 --> 00:18:40.575
Not as a negotiated treaty,
which would've required,

00:18:40.575 --> 00:18:44.109
as I hope you know,
a two-thirds vote of the U.S.

00:18:44.109 --> 00:18:47.616
Senate.
He just did it,

00:18:47.616 --> 00:18:53.456
and Texas was annexed.
Now, Congress eventually did

00:18:53.456 --> 00:18:56.382
vote approval of this,
in a frankly sectionalized

00:18:56.382 --> 00:18:59.369
vote, which was a harbinger of
things to come.

00:18:59.369 --> 00:19:01.501
But James K.
Polk, this expansionist

00:19:01.501 --> 00:19:04.302
president, expansionist
slaveholding president,

00:19:04.302 --> 00:19:07.022
now,
became the sixth of the first

00:19:07.022 --> 00:19:10.640
ten American presidents who was
a slaveholder.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.990
This is significant.
If you'll actually look

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:17.199
back--there's a great book on
this that demonstrates--there's

00:19:17.199 --> 00:19:19.980
lots of writing on this that
demonstrates it--but Don

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.868
Fehrenbacher's book called
Slaveholding Republic

00:19:22.868 --> 00:19:25.863
shows us that before the
American Civil War two-thirds of

00:19:25.863 --> 00:19:28.537
all American presidents were
slaveholders or deeply

00:19:28.537 --> 00:19:32.430
sympathetic with slaveholding,
as in the case of James

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:37.211
Buchanan by the late 1850s.
Two-thirds of all members of

00:19:37.211 --> 00:19:39.730
the U.S.
Supreme Court were

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:42.786
slaveholders.
And, so far as we know,

00:19:42.786 --> 00:19:45.274
James K.
Polk was the only president in

00:19:45.274 --> 00:19:49.269
American history to actually buy
and sell slaves from the Oval

00:19:49.269 --> 00:19:53.348
Office of the White House.
He kept on retainer a broker

00:19:53.348 --> 00:19:56.712
with whom he communicated
regularly, buying and

00:19:56.712 --> 00:20:00.680
selling--speculating in slaves.
It was kind of his hobby.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:07.454
You know, some presidents
engaged in the Hot Stove League

00:20:07.454 --> 00:20:10.579
in the winter,
and do some baseball on paper.

00:20:10.579 --> 00:20:12.440
Polk was selling and buying
some people.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:16.450
Polk was aggressive toward
Mexico.

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:19.380
He ordered American troops to
march south to the Rio Grande

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.755
River, in Texas.
There are already occupation

00:20:23.755 --> 00:20:27.602
troops in Texas.
He ordered them to move south

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:30.607
to the Rio Grande and just,
in effect, see what the

00:20:30.607 --> 00:20:34.162
Mexicans would do.
And he sends Zachary Taylor,

00:20:34.162 --> 00:20:36.946
the American general,
to Matamoras,

00:20:36.946 --> 00:20:40.140
on the Mexico border,
in early 1846.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.904
There was a negotiation
initially set up between the

00:20:42.904 --> 00:20:46.319
American and Mexican military
commanders which was conducted,

00:20:46.319 --> 00:20:49.872
by the way, in French because
the Americans did not speak

00:20:49.872 --> 00:20:52.980
Spanish and the Mexicans did not
speak English,

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.613
but they found enough people on
either side of it to understand

00:20:55.613 --> 00:20:56.590
at least some French.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.660
Mexico had never acknowledged
the Rio Grande.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:10.011
It said their border was the
Nueces, north about 150,200

00:21:10.011 --> 00:21:11.797
miles.
There was a kind of a

00:21:11.797 --> 00:21:14.388
three-week standoff between
troops along the Rio Grande

00:21:14.388 --> 00:21:16.781
River,
and then on the 24^(th) of

00:21:16.781 --> 00:21:21.158
April, 1846, a Mexican cavalry
contingent ambushed American

00:21:21.158 --> 00:21:24.630
troops on the north side of the
Rio Grande,

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:28.619
killed eleven American troops,
captured sixty-three.

00:21:28.619 --> 00:21:34.667
Two days later,
Zachary Taylor sent a dispatch

00:21:34.667 --> 00:21:38.700
over land to Washington,
DC.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:43.877
It took two weeks to get
there--hot news!--and it simply

00:21:43.877 --> 00:21:47.548
announced, quote,
"Hostilities have been

00:21:47.548 --> 00:21:52.725
commenced with Mexico,"
and it briefly told the story

00:21:52.725 --> 00:21:58.450
of the Mexicans attacking on the
north side of the Rio Grande.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:02.311
Polk received the news and he
immediately went to Congress and

00:22:02.311 --> 00:22:05.262
asked for a declaration of war.
He announced,

00:22:05.262 --> 00:22:09.112
quote, "Mexico had passed the
boundary of the United States

00:22:09.112 --> 00:22:12.762
and had invaded our territory
and shed American blood on

00:22:12.762 --> 00:22:19.869
American soil,"
unquote. Blood and soil.

00:22:19.869 --> 00:22:24.019
On May 13,1846,
the House of Representatives

00:22:24.019 --> 00:22:27.880
voted a declaration of war,
174 to 14.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.330
The U.S.
Senate voted 40 to 2,

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:35.400
with a lot of abstentions from
Northerners, to declare war on

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.319
Mexico.
And off we went.

00:22:38.319 --> 00:22:42.690
The first major expansionist
war in American history.

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:45.470
War fever broke out all over
the country.

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:49.981
The romance of going abroad,
an exotic place like Mexico,

00:22:49.981 --> 00:22:54.009
full of strange people speaking
weird languages,

00:22:54.009 --> 00:22:57.305
and they're Catholics and you
never know what you're going to

00:22:57.305 --> 00:23:00.749
find there.
There are all kinds of strange

00:23:00.749 --> 00:23:02.972
practices.
Herman Melville,

00:23:02.972 --> 00:23:07.402
the young writer--hadn't yet
published Moby Dick but

00:23:07.402 --> 00:23:11.680
he was working on it--from his
upstate New York home,

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.563
he said in his town,
"The people here," he said,

00:23:14.563 --> 00:23:16.650
"are all in a state of
delirium.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.230
A military ardor pervades all
ranks.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:26.576
Nothing is talked about but the
Halls of Montezuma," meaning

00:23:26.576 --> 00:23:29.818
Mexico City.
This was going to be an

00:23:29.818 --> 00:23:32.619
adventurous war,
it was going to be quick.

00:23:32.619 --> 00:23:36.910
It was going to be a war of
destiny.

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:41.489
An Illinois newspaper justified
the war on the basis that

00:23:41.489 --> 00:23:45.086
Mexicans were,
I quote, "reptiles in the path

00:23:45.086 --> 00:23:49.212
of progressive democracy."
Now, you know in Vietnam we

00:23:49.212 --> 00:23:52.866
called some people "gooks" and
we've had "Horrible Huns" and

00:23:52.866 --> 00:23:55.839
we've had all kinds of names for
our enemies.

00:23:55.839 --> 00:24:00.136
But they would get more direct
than that--reptiles in the--I'm

00:24:00.136 --> 00:24:01.578
sorry.
[laughter]

00:24:01.578 --> 00:24:05.710
Reptiles in the path of
progressive democracy.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:06.820
Yes, well.

00:24:10.009 --> 00:24:12.775
People rewrote the lyrics to
the song Yankee Doodle to

00:24:12.775 --> 00:24:14.820
fit the Mexican War.
It went like this.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.874
I promise you only one verse.
[sings]

00:24:17.874 --> 00:24:22.042
"They attacked our men upon our
land, and crossed our river,

00:24:22.042 --> 00:24:25.656
too, sir.
Now show them all with sword in

00:24:25.656 --> 00:24:28.870
hand what Yankee boys can do,
sir."

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:33.853
I'm sorry, I have a cold.
[applause]

00:24:33.853 --> 00:24:37.199
Actually, you should do that
with an Irish brogue,

00:24:37.199 --> 00:24:40.819
because that's the way it
would've been done then,

00:24:40.819 --> 00:24:45.085
making fun of the Irish while
you make fun of the Mexicans,

00:24:45.085 --> 00:24:48.910
while you recruit the Irish to
go fight in Mexico.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.890
[laughter]
Many abolitionists had very

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:56.160
serious things to say about this
war, lots of them.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.589
I already mentioned Douglass.
There are many, many others.

00:24:59.589 --> 00:25:05.109
The abolitionist James Russell
Lowell considered the war--his

00:25:05.109 --> 00:25:10.170
words--"a national crime
committed in behoof of slavery,

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:13.636
our common sin."
And most poignantly of all,

00:25:13.636 --> 00:25:16.950
and a title for this lecture,
was Ralph Waldo Emerson.

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:21.104
As usual Emerson wrote this
into his private journals,

00:25:21.104 --> 00:25:25.623
from his study in Concord.
He wasn't out thumping too many

00:25:25.623 --> 00:25:29.220
public platforms on this one,
at least not yet.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.576
Emerson wrote into his journals
in early 1847:

00:25:32.576 --> 00:25:35.710
"The United States will conquer
Mexico,"

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:40.737
he said, "but it will be as
though a man swallows arsenic,

00:25:40.737 --> 00:25:47.790
which brings him down in turn.
Mexico will poison us."

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:54.734
It did.
By the end of 1846,

00:25:54.734 --> 00:25:58.735
the U.S.
had established dominion over

00:25:58.735 --> 00:26:05.440
the southern half of California,
which Mexico also claimed.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:10.566
In 1847, the United States
forces, in the face of pretty

00:26:10.566 --> 00:26:14.679
ferocious resistance,
invading largely through Vera

00:26:14.679 --> 00:26:17.940
Cruz on the Gulf Coast but also
from the North,

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:23.664
conquered Mexico City--the
Halls of Montezuma--hence the

00:26:23.664 --> 00:26:26.370
line in the Marine hymn.

00:26:30.009 --> 00:26:33.861
The United States lost 13,000
Americans in the war with Mexico

00:26:33.861 --> 00:26:36.450
in about a year and a half of
fighting.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:41.779
By far, the vast majority died
of disease and not in battle.

00:26:41.779 --> 00:26:48.423
An estimated 50,000 Americans
died at the sword and the cannon

00:26:48.423 --> 00:26:51.914
of American troops.
And by the end,

00:26:51.914 --> 00:26:56.009
the United States negotiated a
treaty with Mexico.

00:26:56.009 --> 00:26:58.949
We conquered them and we
dictated the terms,

00:26:58.949 --> 00:27:03.119
and the terms had everything to
do with American geography.

00:27:03.119 --> 00:27:06.979
The Mexican Cession,
as it became known--the land

00:27:06.979 --> 00:27:11.080
the United States gained from
Mexico--is, of course,

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:15.127
the whole southwest.
In the Treaty of Guadalupe

00:27:15.127 --> 00:27:18.628
Hidalgo of 1848,
the United States obtained,

00:27:18.628 --> 00:27:22.700
what is today all of the
western part of Texas,

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:26.354
New Mexico, Arizona,
Southern Calif--well all of

00:27:26.354 --> 00:27:29.310
California--Utah,
parts of Colorado,

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:33.400
Nevada--the great southwest.

00:27:37.049 --> 00:27:40.819
That same year,
1848, was a terribly important

00:27:40.819 --> 00:27:43.835
year of turning points,
in the world,

00:27:43.835 --> 00:27:47.690
especially in Europe.
There are those arguing now

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:50.753
that in some ways,
1848 should be as important a

00:27:50.753 --> 00:27:54.730
turning point year in American
history as it is in Europe,

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:57.297
because of the great
democratic/republican

00:27:57.297 --> 00:27:58.800
revolutions in Europe.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:02.588
There are debates now in some
history departments whether the

00:28:02.588 --> 00:28:04.387
U.S.
survey courses should be

00:28:04.387 --> 00:28:07.653
divided in thirds now,
since American history is into

00:28:07.653 --> 00:28:10.623
the 21^(st) century now.
It's just getting too long in

00:28:10.623 --> 00:28:12.599
this country,
it's got too much history now.

00:28:12.599 --> 00:28:18.068
And instead of dividing our
survey courses at 1877 or 1865,

00:28:18.068 --> 00:28:21.720
it should be '48.
Who cares?

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:26.493
But, as these nationalistic
revolutions against monarchy

00:28:26.493 --> 00:28:30.660
were breaking out all over
Europe--in Hungary,

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:34.016
Austria, Italy,
Germany, France--some will

00:28:34.016 --> 00:28:40.329
succeed and establish republics,
some will not--republican

00:28:40.329 --> 00:28:48.659
America was seizing territory
and launching an empire on its

00:28:48.659 --> 00:28:52.465
own continent.
Oh, by the way,

00:28:52.465 --> 00:28:56.869
for ceding us all of that
territory of the great

00:28:56.869 --> 00:29:01.460
southwest, Mexico was paid 15
million dollars.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:04.295
Sitting in the U.S.
House of Representatives at

00:29:04.295 --> 00:29:06.637
that very time,
during the Mexican War,

00:29:06.637 --> 00:29:08.856
in his only two-year term in
the U.S.

00:29:08.856 --> 00:29:12.430
Congress, there was a young
congressman from Illinois named

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.530
Abraham Lincoln.
He voted against the Mexican

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:19.111
War;
every chance he got he opposed

00:29:19.111 --> 00:29:24.049
it.
He called it Polk's War.

00:29:24.049 --> 00:29:27.166
And then he said Polk's
justification--these were the

00:29:27.166 --> 00:29:30.042
days of direct political
language--he said Polk's

00:29:30.042 --> 00:29:36.328
justification for the war was,
quote, "a half insane mumbling

00:29:36.328 --> 00:29:42.160
of a fever dream."
Tell 'em Abe.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:47.750
He didn't mince any words.
Fever dream.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:49.829
All right, but what did the
Mexican War unleash?

00:29:49.829 --> 00:29:51.990
What are the legacies of the
Mexican War?

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:57.985
Why was there such a fuss?
In the outline it says "why all

00:29:57.985 --> 00:30:00.722
the fuss"?
Slavery in the western

00:30:00.722 --> 00:30:05.009
territories.
Who cared?

00:30:05.009 --> 00:30:07.896
Daniel Webster,
who'll play a big role in this

00:30:07.896 --> 00:30:11.809
compromise of 1850 debate--the
great Whig of Massachusetts,

00:30:11.809 --> 00:30:15.021
probably the most powerful and
important northern,

00:30:15.021 --> 00:30:18.297
certainly New England
politician--kept warning that

00:30:18.297 --> 00:30:21.049
this really wasn't all that
important.

00:30:21.049 --> 00:30:25.120
He said the problem of slavery
in the west is like,

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.924
is, quote, is a big fuss over,
quote, "an imaginary negro in

00:30:29.924 --> 00:30:33.417
an impossible place."
And the idea there was,

00:30:33.417 --> 00:30:36.460
"oh, that southwest,
it's all desert isn't it?"

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:41.133
What's the problem?
It's not Louisiana in New

00:30:41.133 --> 00:30:45.800
Mexico, it's not Alabama in
Arizona.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:52.089
Cotton won't boom there.
He called it a mere abstraction.

00:30:52.089 --> 00:30:56.056
But if it were a mere
abstraction, why did so many

00:30:56.056 --> 00:30:59.368
people care?
Let's examine this just for a

00:30:59.368 --> 00:31:01.140
moment.
Why the fuss?

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:04.894
First, Northerners.
And I know I'm generalizing

00:31:04.894 --> 00:31:08.871
here, there's no thing,
there's no such thing as "The

00:31:08.871 --> 00:31:12.203
North" and "The South."
At this point I hope you've

00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:14.809
grasped that.
There are complexities within.

00:31:14.809 --> 00:31:17.440
But to northerners,
one, they cared about this

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.830
because there was the belief
that slavery could indeed take

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:26.569
root in the southwest.
Why wouldn't it be a perfect

00:31:26.569 --> 00:31:33.049
environment for mining of silver
and gold?

00:31:33.049 --> 00:31:34.713
And, lo and behold,
right after the Treaty of

00:31:34.713 --> 00:31:37.170
Guadalupe Hidalgo and the end of
the Mexican War what happened?

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:41.939
Gold was discovered in
California and it just

00:31:41.939 --> 00:31:47.468
capitalized, it just--and they
had all bets off now,

00:31:47.468 --> 00:31:52.779
on just how important this
question might be.

00:31:52.779 --> 00:31:55.956
And why wouldn't slavery work
for the building of the

00:31:55.956 --> 00:31:59.559
railroads, why wouldn't slavery
work for building canals?

00:31:59.559 --> 00:32:03.798
And for that matter,
nobody wanted to compete for

00:32:03.798 --> 00:32:09.008
the slave labor system because
it denigrated or degraded the

00:32:09.008 --> 00:32:12.980
idea of free labor.
Secondly, there were a lot of

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:16.929
northerners, particularly in
politics, who wanted a non--who

00:32:16.929 --> 00:32:20.410
favored here a non-extension
approach to slavery,

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:24.482
whatever they thought of black
people and the future of their

00:32:24.482 --> 00:32:28.079
rights and the idea of any kind
of racial equality.

00:32:28.079 --> 00:32:31.230
They favored non-extension on
constitutional grounds.

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:35.147
The idea was that those who
would not attack slavery where

00:32:35.147 --> 00:32:38.653
it already existed--because
slaves were property and

00:32:38.653 --> 00:32:42.089
protected by the Fifth
Amendment--they nevertheless

00:32:42.089 --> 00:32:45.319
believed they could use the
Constitution,

00:32:45.319 --> 00:32:50.799
under Congress's sole authority
to admit new states to the

00:32:50.799 --> 00:32:55.029
union, to stop this system from
expanding.

00:32:55.029 --> 00:33:01.455
To stop America's future from
becoming defined by slave labor,

00:33:01.455 --> 00:33:06.089
rather than free labor for the
little man.

00:33:06.089 --> 00:33:10.943
Non-extension of slavery,
therefore, became a kind of

00:33:10.943 --> 00:33:15.983
idea whereby you could cordon
off slavery and blunt its

00:33:15.983 --> 00:33:18.495
future.
Three, for northerners:

00:33:18.495 --> 00:33:21.726
bills in Congress for the
territorial organization,

00:33:21.726 --> 00:33:25.023
which already existed now,
as soon as the Mexican

00:33:25.023 --> 00:33:28.776
War--before the Mexican War was
even over--there were bills

00:33:28.776 --> 00:33:32.853
before Congress to establish the
territories now of Utah and New

00:33:32.853 --> 00:33:35.641
Mexico.
Now, in large swaths of land,

00:33:35.641 --> 00:33:39.110
mind you, that could become
more than two states.

00:33:43.009 --> 00:33:46.186
And there were northerners who
found these bills simply

00:33:46.186 --> 00:33:49.523
personally obnoxious,
and they were being asked,

00:33:49.523 --> 00:33:54.329
they said, to be complicitous
now in the expansion of slavery.

00:33:54.329 --> 00:33:58.193
There were now enough northern
politicians who said,

00:33:58.193 --> 00:34:02.739
"Look, I can't stop anything
that's going on in Alabama and I

00:34:02.739 --> 00:34:06.239
won't try,
but don't ask me to vote to

00:34:06.239 --> 00:34:11.300
create a new territory that will
become a slave state."

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:14.513
And already in the language of
the Free Soil Party,

00:34:14.513 --> 00:34:17.920
and eventually in that
Republican Party that will come

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.932
out of it,
is this idea that what

00:34:20.932 --> 00:34:26.694
northerners had to work to do,
they said, was to make slavery

00:34:26.694 --> 00:34:29.960
sectional but freedom national.

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:38.102
Slave labor--sectional,
regional, bound to a place--but

00:34:38.102 --> 00:34:42.912
free labor national,
eternal and the definition of a

00:34:42.912 --> 00:34:45.615
future.
There was also racism as a

00:34:45.615 --> 00:34:48.265
motive in this.
There were lots of northerners

00:34:48.265 --> 00:34:51.300
who saw the West as the hope of
the northern immigrant,

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:55.459
the hope of the young farmer in
Ohio who's got three sons,

00:34:55.459 --> 00:34:59.023
and they want to go West,
and they don't want black

00:34:59.023 --> 00:35:01.679
people around.
They want a Kansas or a

00:35:01.679 --> 00:35:05.227
Nebraska, eventually,
that's free for small white

00:35:05.227 --> 00:35:06.040
farmers.

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:11.819
And that's rooted,
of course, in what we're going

00:35:11.819 --> 00:35:13.780
to come back to again and again
in the next three,

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:17.424
four lectures,
is this idea of a kind of free

00:35:17.424 --> 00:35:20.489
labor ideology,
a cluster of ideas.

00:35:20.489 --> 00:35:25.130
No single idea but a cluster of
impulses, assumptions,

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:29.246
ideas--one of which was
defensive representative

00:35:29.246 --> 00:35:33.061
government,
another of which was a devotion

00:35:33.061 --> 00:35:37.500
to individual liberty for small
people, small farmers,

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.614
lone mechanics,
coupled with now a fear of

00:35:40.614 --> 00:35:43.442
concentrated power.
And what could be a more

00:35:43.442 --> 00:35:46.679
concentrated form of power than
an oligarchy of slaveholders who

00:35:46.679 --> 00:35:48.940
can lo and behold control the
presidency,

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:53.005
the Supreme Court and enough of
Congress, especially the Senate,

00:35:53.005 --> 00:35:56.489
if they can keep getting more
states into the Union,

00:35:56.489 --> 00:35:59.070
than the South,
as a concentrated power?

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:07.148
Free labor ideology was also
rooted in this kind of now

00:36:07.148 --> 00:36:11.670
old-fashioned American fear of
conspiracy against individual

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:16.122
liberty.
Free labor ideology was really

00:36:16.122 --> 00:36:22.127
a fanfare for the common man,
a defense of the white

00:36:22.127 --> 00:36:26.720
Anglo-Saxon Protestant small
farmer.

00:36:30.289 --> 00:36:32.848
And, of course,
finally there were some real

00:36:32.848 --> 00:36:35.764
abolitionists around,
who opposed the expansion of

00:36:35.764 --> 00:36:39.320
slavery on moral grounds.
And sometimes that person who

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:43.170
believes in free labor ideology
and may not want to many black

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:45.820
folks around,
also takes a kind of moral

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.850
position against slavery,
all at the same time.

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:55.019
And his name was Abraham
Lincoln.

00:36:55.019 --> 00:37:00.386
Now in the South,
why did the South care about

00:37:00.386 --> 00:37:04.696
slavery in the West?
In part, because an assumption

00:37:04.696 --> 00:37:07.001
had set in among southern
leadership, now,

00:37:07.001 --> 00:37:08.070
for a long time,

00:37:12.039 --> 00:37:15.539
that it was not only the
destiny of the American people

00:37:15.539 --> 00:37:18.455
to expand west,
it was not only the destiny of

00:37:18.455 --> 00:37:21.890
the slave society to expand
west--and remember they're

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:25.973
manufacturing decade by decade a
more intensive justification of

00:37:25.973 --> 00:37:28.889
the system--but it was the
necessity,

00:37:28.889 --> 00:37:31.700
they're going to argue,
that it expand or it would die.

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:37.707
To check the expansion of
slavery would be to strangle the

00:37:37.707 --> 00:37:40.405
southern economy and way of
life, is what so many southern

00:37:40.405 --> 00:37:43.875
politicians are now arguing.
Slaves in existing states,

00:37:43.875 --> 00:37:47.560
also they came to realize,
were becoming a burden,

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.914
possibly a danger.
As the slave population in a

00:37:50.914 --> 00:37:54.399
Georgia or an Alabama or a
Mississippi continues to grow

00:37:54.399 --> 00:37:58.423
and grow and grow and grow,
but nowhere to expand to,

00:37:58.423 --> 00:38:03.010
that slave population may
become indeed a powder keg.

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:06.921
One of the things that southern
statesmen feared the most--and I

00:38:06.921 --> 00:38:10.253
cannot stress enough,
because it's going to be right

00:38:10.253 --> 00:38:13.806
there at the heart of their
secession debates in 1860--is

00:38:13.806 --> 00:38:17.486
they feared what they kept
calling now this--it's more than

00:38:17.486 --> 00:38:21.039
a theory to them--this theory of
a shrinking south.

00:38:21.039 --> 00:38:23.361
If they couldn't expand this
system beyond its limits and

00:38:23.361 --> 00:38:25.019
beyond its borders--get into
Arkansas,

00:38:25.019 --> 00:38:28.467
get out into Oklahoma,
Texas, West Texas,

00:38:28.467 --> 00:38:32.260
further west,
Caribbean--that the south would

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.880
begin to shrink as an economic
entity,

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.065
as a political culture,
as a force in the national

00:38:39.065 --> 00:38:41.632
government.
And if you cordoned off

00:38:41.632 --> 00:38:46.126
slavery, what's going to happen
to the price of slaves around

00:38:46.126 --> 00:38:48.682
its borders?
Well, they might begin to go

00:38:48.682 --> 00:38:50.780
down.
What happens if the price of

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:53.721
slaves starts going down in
Kentucky, Virginia,

00:38:53.721 --> 00:38:56.544
Maryland, around the edges?
Well, people start selling them

00:38:56.544 --> 00:38:57.439
off.
Where are they going to sell

00:38:57.439 --> 00:39:00.159
them?
Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi.

00:39:00.159 --> 00:39:04.440
And you would have the
beginnings now of an economy

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.410
turning in on itself.

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:12.149
Southerners,
many southerners,

00:39:12.149 --> 00:39:16.010
came to believe slavery had to
expand or it could die.

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.643
They also wanted political
parity in the United States

00:39:18.643 --> 00:39:21.703
Congress.
Every new state meant two new

00:39:21.703 --> 00:39:26.334
senators.
And the number of states--free

00:39:26.334 --> 00:39:31.102
states to slave states,
folks--in 1850,

00:39:31.102 --> 00:39:34.930
was 15 to 15.
They wanted to sustain that

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.528
parity.
And California out there--it's

00:39:37.528 --> 00:39:41.713
going to have a sudden statehood
in 1850 because of gold being

00:39:41.713 --> 00:39:45.829
discovered--is going to be the
problem and the test case.

00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:51.070
Then there was this question of
constitutional power.

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:54.835
The question of checks and
balances--the states' rights

00:39:54.835 --> 00:39:56.440
question if you want.

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:04.707
Did anybody have the right to
prohibit anybody from taking

00:40:04.707 --> 00:40:07.542
their property anywhere?
To John C.

00:40:07.542 --> 00:40:11.764
Calhoun, at the end of the day,
all these other arguments here

00:40:11.764 --> 00:40:14.803
were important,
but the only argument at the

00:40:14.803 --> 00:40:18.837
end of the day that mattered--I
mean he could drive it home with

00:40:18.837 --> 00:40:22.551
a brilliance unlike anybody
else's--"You have no right--you

00:40:22.551 --> 00:40:26.394
northerners have no right to
stop me from taking my wagon and

00:40:26.394 --> 00:40:29.340
my horse and my slave anywhere I
wish."

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.270
And he would just recite the
Fifth Amendment.

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:42.805
Let me put it yet one more way.
There is a certain element of

00:40:42.805 --> 00:40:44.847
honor at stake here,
in the South,

00:40:44.847 --> 00:40:45.900
about slavery.

00:40:49.039 --> 00:40:52.308
Their moral stance comes from
this belief, this position--and

00:40:52.308 --> 00:40:54.269
think about this in your own
time.

00:40:54.269 --> 00:40:57.881
The idea set in among
northerners that the legal

00:40:57.881 --> 00:41:02.646
status of slavery in the western
territories stood as a measure

00:41:02.646 --> 00:41:05.489
of its moral standing
everywhere.

00:41:05.489 --> 00:41:08.489
Let me repeat that,
the legal standing of slavery

00:41:08.489 --> 00:41:12.050
in the western territories stood
as a measure of its moral

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:16.030
standing everywhere.
If you tell me slavery is wrong

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:20.190
enough that you will not have it
in America's future,

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:24.429
then you're telling me it's
wrong where I have it;

00:41:24.429 --> 00:41:28.693
and I don't accept that,
and I won't live in the same

00:41:28.693 --> 00:41:33.286
political culture with you,
if I have to--if I don't have

00:41:33.286 --> 00:41:35.090
to--on that basis.

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:42.540
So why all the fuss?
Think today,

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:47.398
think today about some of our
greatest, salient,

00:41:47.398 --> 00:41:52.980
polarizing issues--at the risk
of bringing them up.

00:41:57.070 --> 00:42:00.399
If I were a gay American,
and I believed in my right to

00:42:00.399 --> 00:42:04.345
be married, I would believe that
the legal status of gay marriage

00:42:04.345 --> 00:42:07.119
in a Kansas where they have a
referendum,

00:42:07.119 --> 00:42:09.600
is a measure of its moral
status everywhere.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.840
And extrapolate from there,
to other issues.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:21.829
If you outlaw who I am,
what I do, what I stand for in

00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:25.820
one state, what are you saying
about it in another?

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:34.146
Oh, we shouldn't talk about the
present in history courses,

00:42:34.146 --> 00:42:34.650
I'm sorry.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:41.344
The fuss is because this is
really a debate about America's

00:42:41.344 --> 00:42:42.696
future.
What kind of future would it

00:42:42.696 --> 00:42:44.817
have?
Well, there were four plans put

00:42:44.817 --> 00:42:48.202
in place and these four plans
are going to come together

00:42:48.202 --> 00:42:51.280
around this debate over the
Compromise of 1850.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:56.512
The first plan--these are all
on your outline if you could see

00:42:56.512 --> 00:42:59.600
it earlier--you want that back
up?

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:11.412
The first we call the Wilmot
Proviso, for good reason--it's

00:43:11.412 --> 00:43:15.539
named for David Wilmot,
a young Democratic Party

00:43:15.539 --> 00:43:19.390
Representative in the House of
Representatives,

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:24.413
who in 1846 got up in the midst
of the Mexican War--this is a

00:43:24.413 --> 00:43:28.599
Democrat now and not a Whig or a
Free Soiler.

00:43:28.599 --> 00:43:32.258
He's from Pennsylvania,
and he didn't particularly care

00:43:32.258 --> 00:43:36.459
about black folks but he got up
in the debates over the Mexican

00:43:36.459 --> 00:43:40.524
War about provisions for the
troops and all those debates and

00:43:40.524 --> 00:43:44.076
he said "okay,
we're going to war with Mexico,

00:43:44.076 --> 00:43:48.116
but in any new territory we
gain from Mexico slavery shall

00:43:48.116 --> 00:43:50.340
never exist."
It's as simple as that,

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:54.380
that's the Wilmot Proviso.
It's a great trivia question.

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.550
If you ever have to play trivia
in a bar ask what's the Wilmot

00:43:57.550 --> 00:44:00.090
Proviso?
Nobody knows.

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:03.889
But it was the rallying cry of
the Free Soil Movement.

00:44:03.889 --> 00:44:08.525
Okay, we're going to war,
we're going to get millions of

00:44:08.525 --> 00:44:12.740
acres of territory but slavery
will never exist.

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:17.932
This was the Free Soil formula.
The language was borrowed from

00:44:17.932 --> 00:44:21.761
the Northwest Ordinance.
All but one northern state

00:44:21.761 --> 00:44:26.624
legislature endorsed it.
All southern legislatures

00:44:26.624 --> 00:44:31.300
condemned it.
Gee, a little harbinger of

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:35.010
things to come there,
perhaps.

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:38.041
It first passed the House of
Representatives on the first try

00:44:38.041 --> 00:44:40.869
83 to 64, reflecting that the
House had far more northern

00:44:40.869 --> 00:44:43.800
representatives because the
north has more population.

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:48.955
But it did not pass the Senate
where the Slave states still

00:44:48.955 --> 00:44:52.926
have parity.
There was a good deal of racist

00:44:52.926 --> 00:44:59.141
support for this.
Wilmot himself said--well I'll

00:44:59.141 --> 00:45:02.718
quote him.
And here again this free labor

00:45:02.718 --> 00:45:04.910
ideology, it's a mixture of
ideas.

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:07.942
This is Wilmot in the debates.
"I have no squeamish

00:45:07.942 --> 00:45:11.916
sensitiveness upon the subject
of slavery nor no morbid

00:45:11.916 --> 00:45:16.181
sympathy for the slave.
I plead the cause and rights of

00:45:16.181 --> 00:45:19.695
white freemen.
I would preserve to free white

00:45:19.695 --> 00:45:22.863
labor a fair country,
a rich inheritance,

00:45:22.863 --> 00:45:27.219
where the sons of toil of my
own race and color can live

00:45:27.219 --> 00:45:31.654
without the disgrace which
association with Negro slavery

00:45:31.654 --> 00:45:37.570
brings upon free labor."
It doesn't get more direct than

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:40.454
that.
Keep the west free of

00:45:40.454 --> 00:45:47.099
slavery--and black people--was
really David Wilmot's position.

00:45:47.099 --> 00:45:51.173
The second possible plan is
what was known formally,

00:45:51.173 --> 00:45:55.658
legally, as state sovereignty.
This is the states' rights

00:45:55.658 --> 00:45:58.933
position.
This is the South's position,

00:45:58.933 --> 00:46:03.912
at least on this question--the
individual's constitutional

00:46:03.912 --> 00:46:09.415
right of ownership in slaves as
property and transport of slaves

00:46:09.415 --> 00:46:12.396
as property.
State sovereignty,

00:46:12.396 --> 00:46:16.551
states' rights was indeed
deeply at the root of the

00:46:16.551 --> 00:46:19.710
South's growing position here
that,

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:24.653
ultimately, no Federal
Legislature, President--no

00:46:24.653 --> 00:46:30.420
Federal authorit--existed to
stop slavery's expansion.

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:34.993
The third position,
a very American position,

00:46:34.993 --> 00:46:38.840
a natural outcome of the first
two.

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:41.958
The first two mix like oil and
water, you need a compromise

00:46:41.958 --> 00:46:44.269
position--and that's popular
sovereignty.

00:46:44.269 --> 00:46:47.606
Popular sovereignty was not a
new idea in the midst of the

00:46:47.606 --> 00:46:50.699
Mexican War and its aftermath.
It'd been around for awhile.

00:46:50.699 --> 00:46:54.670
It was the simple idea that
there would be no Act of

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:58.192
Congress on this.
Take Congress out of the story

00:46:58.192 --> 00:47:02.550
and simply let the people in the
Western Territory have a vote.

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:06.190
Let them have a referendum.
Let there be popular democracy.

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:09.397
If the people who settle Utah
want to vote to have slave labor

00:47:09.397 --> 00:47:12.590
then they vote for it;
if they don't, they don't.

00:47:12.590 --> 00:47:14.820
Democracy, what could be better?

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:20.733
This had the wonderful kind of
charm of ambiguity,

00:47:20.733 --> 00:47:23.511
as David Potter once
beautifully put it--a charm of

00:47:23.511 --> 00:47:26.153
ambiguity.
There's kind of a place there

00:47:26.153 --> 00:47:28.596
for everybody,
as long as you trust the

00:47:28.596 --> 00:47:30.010
democratic process.

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:36.880
But if you're going to have
that referendum the problem of

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.390
course always was,
when do you hold the vote?

00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:45.178
Do you hold the vote early in
the territorial process or do

00:47:45.178 --> 00:47:48.019
you hold the vote late in the
territorial process?

00:47:48.019 --> 00:47:51.610
Do you establish a rule,
there's got to be a certain

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:55.059
amount of population before you
hold that vote.

00:47:55.059 --> 00:47:58.412
Southerners wanted that vote
held late in the process because

00:47:58.412 --> 00:48:01.150
it would give their system
longer to get there.

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:05.216
It would take awhile.
If you're going to take fifty

00:48:05.216 --> 00:48:07.297
slaves out to Kansas and
Nebraska, or further west,

00:48:07.297 --> 00:48:09.742
it'd take awhile;
for that lone farmer in his

00:48:09.742 --> 00:48:12.310
Conestoga wagon,
he can get there quicker.

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.324
And fourth, they went back to
the old Missouri

00:48:19.324 --> 00:48:22.369
Compromise--it's the principle
of geographical

00:48:22.369 --> 00:48:25.955
division--here--it's the old
principle of geographical

00:48:25.955 --> 00:48:26.970
division.

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:34.235
The Missouri Compromise of
1820--you all learned this

00:48:34.235 --> 00:48:39.191
somewhere in school--established
the 36º30' parallel from

00:48:39.191 --> 00:48:43.010
the Mississippi River to the
Pacific Ocean,

00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:48.206
and it said in 1820--a very
important Act of Congress in

00:48:48.206 --> 00:48:52.805
1820 in this story,
now to be so twisted and abused

00:48:52.805 --> 00:48:56.349
and debated in the 1850s as a
sacred act.

00:48:56.349 --> 00:49:02.329
It said slavery would never
exist north of that line.

00:49:02.329 --> 00:49:06.958
The problem was that half of
California was already north of

00:49:06.958 --> 00:49:09.099
that line.
Now a lot of people said,

00:49:09.099 --> 00:49:12.072
"all right, the way we're going
to head this problem off now is

00:49:12.072 --> 00:49:14.710
just to keep drawing careful
geographic lines across the

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:16.879
continent,
free soil above,

00:49:16.879 --> 00:49:22.280
slave labor below;
we'll just keep drawing that

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:25.549
line."
All right, I'm going to have to

00:49:25.549 --> 00:49:29.489
leave you hanging here about the
compromise itself.

00:49:29.489 --> 00:49:32.849
That's fine because we can do
the compromise--its

00:49:32.849 --> 00:49:36.980
collapse--aand lead right into
the Kansas Nebraska--hold on,

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:38.940
I got a minute,
I think.

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:42.380
The Election of 1848 was
crucial.

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:45.202
Democrats ran Lewis Cass of
Michigan--a thoroughly

00:49:45.202 --> 00:49:48.255
forgettable politician,
I'm sure you've never heard of

00:49:48.255 --> 00:49:50.733
him--but he was a great
proponent of popular

00:49:50.733 --> 00:49:53.069
sovereignty.
They ran on a popular

00:49:53.069 --> 00:49:56.892
sovereignty platform.
The problem with slavery in the

00:49:56.892 --> 00:50:01.977
West now, this whole Mexican War
problem, we'll solve it--popular

00:50:01.977 --> 00:50:04.044
democracy.
The Whigs ran Zachary Taylor,

00:50:04.044 --> 00:50:05.969
the war hero of the Mexican
War, old rough and ready;

00:50:05.969 --> 00:50:08.370
the problem was he was a
Louisiana slaveholder.

00:50:13.039 --> 00:50:18.409
And out of this furor over the
expansion of slavery in the West

00:50:18.409 --> 00:50:21.440
came two new political
offshoots.

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:26.010
One was called the Conscience
Whigs.

00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:29.910
They were created first in
Massachusetts and they gave us

00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:32.070
Charles Sumner,
among others;

00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:34.950
a group of abolitionist Whigs
who broke with the Whig party

00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:38.206
now and would never go back,
a harbinger of the ultimate

00:50:38.206 --> 00:50:41.739
death, within the next four
years, of the Whig Party.

00:50:41.739 --> 00:50:46.039
And the other was the Free Soil
party.

00:50:46.039 --> 00:50:49.796
Born in the Convention in
Buffalo, New York in 1848,

00:50:49.796 --> 00:50:54.510
it ran Martin Van Buren--an odd
choice--for President in 1848;

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:55.650
a former President.

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:02.076
They stood for one thing:
stopping, at all costs,

00:51:02.076 --> 00:51:05.039
the expansion of slavery into
America's west.

00:51:05.039 --> 00:51:11.614
The Free Soilers took ten
percent of the electoral vote in

00:51:11.614 --> 00:51:17.034
the 1848 election when Zachary
Taylor, war hero,

00:51:17.034 --> 00:51:20.982
was elected.
And then gold was discovered in

00:51:20.982 --> 00:51:24.170
California and overnight,
it seemed like--it was

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:28.580
overnight--California was going
to be ready for statehood and,

00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:31.595
oh God, what to do with it?
Because if it comes in as a

00:51:31.595 --> 00:51:34.478
Free state or a Slave state it's
going to upset the balance in

00:51:34.478 --> 00:51:37.114
the Senate;
and it's that huge territory

00:51:37.114 --> 00:51:40.422
out there.
And suddenly there was a need,

00:51:40.422 --> 00:51:44.559
a desperate need--threats
coming from the South.

00:51:44.559 --> 00:51:46.925
John C.
Calhoun is calling a Southern

00:51:46.925 --> 00:51:49.624
Convention.
Threats from some northerners

00:51:49.624 --> 00:51:52.615
who are saying "no,
under all costs we will stop

00:51:52.615 --> 00:51:55.980
the expansion of slavery."
There's a need to find yet new

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:56.740
middle ground.

00:52:00.039 --> 00:52:03.171
And on a night in January,
1850 Henry Clay got together

00:52:03.171 --> 00:52:06.708
and sloshed down a hell of a lot
of brandy with Daniel Webster

00:52:06.708 --> 00:52:11.781
and they cut a deal.
It became the Compromise of

00:52:11.781 --> 00:52:14.849
1850.
I'll leave you hanging there.

00:52:14.849 --> 00:52:20.505
Clay and Webster are drunk but
they're fashioning the Great

00:52:20.505 --> 00:52:25.769
Compromise, or they hope,
that would save the Union.

00:52:25.769 --> 00:52:29.890
Clay, at the end of that month,
would go before the U.S.

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:34.159
Senate and announce the five
provisions of his compromise,

00:52:34.159 --> 00:52:38.879
and in so doing he stood up and
he held a piece of the coffin of

00:52:38.879 --> 00:52:42.924
George Washington--now I don't
know if it really was or

00:52:42.924 --> 00:52:46.670
not--but it was a piece of the
True Cross,

00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:49.623
a little piece of wood.
"This is from George

00:52:49.623 --> 00:52:53.784
Washington's coffin," he said.
We must circle the wagons,

00:52:53.784 --> 00:52:58.195
we must save the Union,
we must swallow this and do

00:52:58.195 --> 00:53:00.941
that."
And there were groans and there

00:53:00.941 --> 00:53:06.179
were cheers.
People wept, shouted.

00:53:06.179 --> 00:53:10.734
And people were really worried
that the Union was going to

00:53:10.734 --> 00:53:14.250
unravel and fall apart--and it
almost did.

00:53:14.250 --> 00:53:15.250
See you.

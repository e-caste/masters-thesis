00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.000
Prof: All right.
 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.320
I'm going to talk about
imperialism today.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.140
This complements the chapter in
the book.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.434
The main topic is the New
Imperialism, and the lecture is

00:00:21.434 --> 00:00:26.710
very much about the culture of
imperialism.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.051
Part of the age of mass
politics in Europe in the 1880s

00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:39.861
and 1890s, before World War I,
involved massive support for

00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:42.680
the New Imperialism.
 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.290
What was new about the New
Imperialism?

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:54.030
What period do we talk about as
having had the New Imperialism?

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.638
It's really from the mid-1880s,
just say the 1880s,

00:00:58.638 --> 00:00:59.560
to 1914.
 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.026
It's at that point,
as you can see from the maps in

00:01:03.026 --> 00:01:06.075
the book and you can see from
the discussion,

00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:09.819
that the European powers really
conquer the world.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:12.750
There's no other way to put it.
 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.536
There's a frenetic,
wild chase even to the South

00:01:16.536 --> 00:01:18.390
Pole as part of that.
 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.733
The African continent,
of which there were huge blanks

00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:28.680
in the maps of Africa,
by 1914 virtually the entire

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.440
continent was not only charted
but had been conquered.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.620
Europeans really control the
globe.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.144
The Americans,
in a smaller way,

00:01:44.144 --> 00:01:48.010
are part of the New
Imperialism.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:54.330
Let me just start out by posing
the question,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.810
and I sent all this stuff
around to you,

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.527
so I don't have to scribble on
the board and you don't have to

00:01:58.527 --> 00:02:01.200
try to figure out what it is
that's written on the board,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.959
because it's hard to see from
here.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:09.972
If you were going to point out
or to claim that there was a

00:02:09.972 --> 00:02:15.050
central reason for the New
Imperialism,

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.360
why even Bismarck,
who described colonies as an

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.319
albatross around the neck of
Germany while he gets into the

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.103
kind of feeding frenzy himself,
it's been put rather cleverly

00:02:28.103 --> 00:02:31.568
by a guy called Baumgar a long
time ago,

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:37.970
that it comes down to God,
gold, and glory.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.923
There were those who
interpreted the mad quest for

00:02:42.923 --> 00:02:47.270
colonies as being the missionary
impulse.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.632
A sort of subset of this would
be the French idea that there

00:02:52.632 --> 00:02:58.266
was a civilizing mission going
on and trying to give indigenous

00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:01.628
peoples access to French
culture.

00:03:01.628 --> 00:03:06.659
Basically it argues that Dutch
Calvinist ministers,

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.620
and Lutheran ministers,
and Catholic priests,

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.744
and other denominations
encouraged states and their own

00:03:16.744 --> 00:03:24.923
church people to bring to their
religion indigenous peoples all

00:03:24.923 --> 00:03:27.430
over the place.
 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.669
Well, we can dispense with that
one.

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.938
That was part of it, of course.
 

00:03:31.938 --> 00:03:35.079
You can't distinguish any of
these three and say that any of

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.250
them are nul.
 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.759
But that is a rather small part
of the quest for yet more

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:48.941
colonies in the New Imperialism,
and indeed for all of the

00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:52.711
well-meant,
however condescending in many

00:03:52.711 --> 00:03:56.930
cases,
quest for religious conversion.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.316
Most of the Lutheran ministers
and Dutch Calvinist ministers in

00:04:01.316 --> 00:04:04.699
Southeast Asia,
and Catholic priests all over

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:08.628
the place such as Vietnam--my
friend Charles Keith just

00:04:08.628 --> 00:04:12.194
finished a dissertation on
Catholic Vietnam in the

00:04:12.194 --> 00:04:16.706
1920s--most of those priests in
areas such as Africa were there

00:04:16.706 --> 00:04:21.509
to tend to the religious needs
of the European communities.

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.449
It was particularly true of,
for example,

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:28.641
Lutheran ministers in German
Southwest Africa and in other

00:04:28.641 --> 00:04:29.449
places.
 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:36.545
The drive to convert peoples to
organized European religions was

00:04:36.545 --> 00:04:40.372
probably greatest,
and the Vietnam case is a very

00:04:40.372 --> 00:04:42.442
good one,
and the role of the Catholic

00:04:42.442 --> 00:04:45.726
Church is extremely interesting
in Vietnam and the origins of

00:04:45.726 --> 00:04:47.149
Vietnamese nationalism.
 

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:49.740
But that is another story.
 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.279
The second one was gold.
 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:55.141
Gee, I put a "d"
for the "o"

00:04:55.141 --> 00:04:57.819
in gold, but it's spelled
G-O-L-D usually.

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:02.889
I said in what you're reading
that if you get Karl Marx,

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.470
if he ever sat together with
Hobson,

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.639
a very major economic thinker
whom I describe in there,

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.728
if they were having dinner,
there would be a lot that was

00:05:12.728 --> 00:05:14.370
uncomfortable about the dinner.
 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.819
But they would really agree.
 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.170
They would say that the New
Imperialism, of which obviously

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.220
Hobson was a great critic,
emerged out of the quest for

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.170
riches, for resources.
 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.860
Part of Marxism and part of
Leninism,

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.771
an important part was that
imperialism is sort of the final

00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:34.879
stage of the development of
capitalism,

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:37.790
and that states need new
markets.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.209
They need new resources.
 

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:47.238
Therefore, they set out to,
at a time of economic

00:05:47.238 --> 00:05:52.829
crisis--nothing like now,
but there is a depression that

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:57.987
lasts from 1874 to the
mid-1890s--they set out to find

00:05:57.987 --> 00:05:59.350
new riches.
 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.610
The people going up the Niger
River, for example,

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.247
where I've been in Mali,
they expected to find gold

00:06:09.247 --> 00:06:13.747
around the next bend,
or more peanut oil,

00:06:13.747 --> 00:06:17.064
or diamonds,
because of the diamonds in

00:06:17.064 --> 00:06:19.726
South Africa,
which was the equivalent of the

00:06:19.726 --> 00:06:20.860
gold rush in the U.S.
 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.939
in about 1848 in California.
 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:26.730
Hobson was no Marxist at all.
 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.295
And he was a critic of the
brutality of the New

00:06:29.295 --> 00:06:32.029
Imperialism, which I'll talk
about in a minute.

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:34.470
But he said,
"If you want to find out

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.545
where this all began,
you look at high finance in the

00:06:37.545 --> 00:06:40.759
City," the City being the
City in London,

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:43.529
Westminster,
where the high rollers,

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:45.810
and the bankers,
and the big capitalists are.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:51.319
There are the origins of the
New Imperialism.

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:56.230
Now, there were critics of the
New Imperialism.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.759
Most of them,
but not all,

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:58.860
were in Britain.
 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:04.735
Many of them opposed the New
Imperialism because of the

00:07:04.735 --> 00:07:11.699
brutality exerted on indigenous
peoples by the imperial power.

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:16.819
There was a real wave of
opposition, for example,

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:22.860
to imperialism that swept
through Britain and London in

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:28.120
1900 in what they called the
Khaki Election,

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:35.035
khaki because it was the color
of the uniforms of many of the

00:07:35.035 --> 00:07:39.069
British soldiers in hot
climates.

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:46.810
Some of the opposition in the
liberal party were opposed,

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:52.339
ran on a campaign of
anti-imperialism.

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:53.639
They were just wiped away.
 

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:57.190
They were just absolutely swept
away in the elections of 1900.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.646
Ordinary people in Britain
thrilling to the accounts of

00:08:01.646 --> 00:08:05.360
colonial exploits voted
overwhelmingly for the

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.560
conservatives who just blow the
liberals out of the water,

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.899
and the labor party exists in
1900,

00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:17.829
but is not yet a major force.
 

00:08:17.829 --> 00:08:24.069
Imperialism carries the day.
 

00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:27.617
The big parades in London of
returning soldiers from the Boer

00:08:27.617 --> 00:08:30.160
War in South Africa and from
other wars,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.638
from all the wars,
they are greeted as conquering

00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:36.320
heroes nowhere more
frenetically,

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.720
enthusiastically,
exuberantly than the City,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.129
because there is a link between
big finance,

00:08:42.129 --> 00:08:47.110
big capital and imperialism.
 

00:08:51.298 --> 00:08:53.976
Besides that,
we have a category we call

00:08:53.976 --> 00:08:55.418
social imperialism.
 

00:08:55.418 --> 00:09:01.471
The imperialist power saw
imperialism as part of the

00:09:01.471 --> 00:09:05.269
overall strategy of conquests.
 

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:08.155
They said, "Look,
if you've got economic problems

00:09:08.155 --> 00:09:11.909
at home and you've got a lot of
unemployed workers--also in

00:09:11.909 --> 00:09:15.923
France--if you've got a lot of
unemployed workers who happen to

00:09:15.923 --> 00:09:18.058
be socialists,
or in Italy,

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:20.750
that you could kind of export
your problems,

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.980
because you can point people in
the direction and say,

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.490
‘Hey,
times are tough here.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:28.326
But if you go to Algeria,
we'll rip off some Arab land

00:09:28.326 --> 00:09:30.860
for you and you'll be just
fine.'

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:36.580
Or ‘You can go make it
rich in Vietnam.'

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:40.215
Or ‘You can go to Kenya
or to Ghana,' (or what would

00:09:40.215 --> 00:09:41.808
become Kenya or Ghana).
 

00:09:41.808 --> 00:09:46.019
‘You can export your
social problems.'"

00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:48.889
This is sort of what New
Imperialism meant.

00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:53.570
A classic case would be the
insurrection of 1851.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.288
This is backing up before the
New Imperialism.

00:09:55.288 --> 00:09:59.328
What do they do with the people
who are arrested after the

00:09:59.328 --> 00:10:00.960
insurrection of 1851?
 

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.428
A lot of them are sent to
Algeria.

00:10:03.428 --> 00:10:06.409
You export your "social
and political problems."

00:10:06.409 --> 00:10:09.711
The irony there,
amazing delicious irony,

00:10:09.711 --> 00:10:11.464
is their great,
great, great,

00:10:11.464 --> 00:10:13.513
great,
great grandchildren end up

00:10:13.513 --> 00:10:16.360
being right-wing supporters of
the National Front,

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.937
and before that of various
right-wing groups that believe

00:10:20.937 --> 00:10:25.842
in French Algeria and who try to
keep the French from leaving

00:10:25.842 --> 00:10:29.979
Algeria in the early 1960s,
after the Algerian war of

00:10:29.979 --> 00:10:30.830
independence.
 

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:38.291
So, social imperialism is seen
by sort of the economic canon,

00:10:38.291 --> 00:10:41.880
that is,
the way of thinking about the

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.870
political economy of these
countries,

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.230
as a way of keeping things calm
at home.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.759
They say, "Give people
opportunities.

00:10:48.759 --> 00:10:50.090
Send them to these foreign
places."

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:55.730
Geez, in the case of France I
remember reading these gripping,

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.664
just pathetic stories of these
people who just can't make it in

00:10:58.664 --> 00:11:01.080
the area in which we live in the
south of France.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.360
They pack up all their stuff
and they walk.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.629
They walk or they get little
push carts,

00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:08.558
try to get to Avignon,
try to get to Marseilles,

00:11:08.558 --> 00:11:11.734
try to get a boat to get to
Morocco, or Tunisia,

00:11:11.734 --> 00:11:14.090
or Algeria,
to try to make a living there.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:18.261
This, too, is part of social
imperialism and is part of the

00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:21.929
idea that somehow social
imperialism is economically

00:11:21.929 --> 00:11:23.009
determined.
 

00:11:23.009 --> 00:11:24.899
That it's the final stage of
capitalism.

00:11:24.899 --> 00:11:27.110
Is that the biggest reason?
 

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:28.690
No.
 

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.288
But it's damn important.
 

00:11:30.288 --> 00:11:35.298
The biggest reason has to do
with the entangling alliances

00:11:35.298 --> 00:11:37.759
and great power rivalries.
 

00:11:37.759 --> 00:11:43.139
It's represented best by
Fashoda,

00:11:43.139 --> 00:11:47.163
at the end of the 1890s,
where a British force stumbles

00:11:47.163 --> 00:11:50.101
into a French force in the
middle of Sudan and they say

00:11:50.101 --> 00:11:53.524
nasty things to each other,
finally toast each other with

00:11:53.524 --> 00:11:57.111
what drinks they had brought
along and their countries almost

00:11:57.111 --> 00:11:59.827
go to war,
because the flag would be

00:11:59.827 --> 00:12:04.256
tarnished by losing out to the
craven reptiles that you just

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:06.509
stumbled into in the Sudan.
 

00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:13.331
The New Imperialism is one of
the fundamental causes of World

00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:15.149
War I, period.
 

00:12:15.149 --> 00:12:17.559
That is the biggest reason.
 

00:12:17.559 --> 00:12:22.259
Now, don't get rid of the gold
interpretation completely,

00:12:22.259 --> 00:12:26.913
because obviously as Britain
and Germany become huge economic

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:29.190
rivals,
big economic rivals,

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:34.677
as the Germans are not only
nipping at the heels of the

00:12:34.677 --> 00:12:37.133
city,
British industrial production

00:12:37.133 --> 00:12:40.352
and British naval production,
but passing them in things like

00:12:40.352 --> 00:12:44.389
chemistry,
and production of steel,

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:47.100
and the production of big
battleships.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.019
All this stuff runs together.
 

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:54.799
Your victory is your craven
reptile opponent's loss.

00:12:54.799 --> 00:12:56.769
That's the way they viewed it.
 

00:12:56.769 --> 00:12:59.249
Most people,
I'll talk about this on

00:12:59.249 --> 00:13:00.100
Wednesday.
 

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.750
It's fun to talk about,
sad but also fun.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.964
Most people in the 1890s
thought that the next war would

00:13:05.964 --> 00:13:07.658
involve France and Britain.
 

00:13:07.658 --> 00:13:11.149
They'll be fighting again and
their rivals here and there.

00:13:11.149 --> 00:13:13.476
Or they thought that maybe the
British and the Russians would

00:13:13.476 --> 00:13:15.881
fight because they're rivals in
what was called the "Great

00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:19.009
Game" for north of India,
and Afghanistan,

00:13:19.009 --> 00:13:23.690
and all of that.
 

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:30.831
Basically, glory and the great
power rivalries is the biggest

00:13:30.831 --> 00:13:36.424
reason that Germany gets into
the imperial game,

00:13:36.424 --> 00:13:38.330
for example.
 

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.996
Bismarck--;it's the famous
Bismarck story--a really awful

00:13:41.996 --> 00:13:42.389
man.
 

00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:47.254
But when there's an imperial
lobby comes racing along and

00:13:47.254 --> 00:13:51.740
says,
"Look, Herr Chancellor,

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.528
we really need to have the
troops go and protect our

00:13:53.528 --> 00:13:54.158
merchants."
 

00:13:54.158 --> 00:13:56.445
People like the sort of
freelance guy,

00:13:56.445 --> 00:13:57.308
Karl Peters.
 

00:13:57.308 --> 00:14:00.660
He said at one point,
he slams down a map of Europe

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.548
on the table and he says,
"That's my map of Africa.

00:14:04.548 --> 00:14:06.933
Here we are and we're
surrounded by Russia and

00:14:06.933 --> 00:14:07.730
France."
 

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:12.798
But toward the end of his
career was completely different.

00:14:12.798 --> 00:14:18.350
He's backing up German
merchants with expeditionary

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.350
forces.
 

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.230
Plant the flag and then you'd
better defend it.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:30.100
The big issue there is rivalry
with France and with Russia.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.575
Bismarck says, "Geez,
if we can get the French

00:14:33.575 --> 00:14:35.629
interested in all these colonies
in Africa,

00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:39.529
then they won't be dreaming of
re-conquering Alsace and much of

00:14:39.529 --> 00:14:40.600
Lorraine."
 

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.832
At the end he says,
"Well, we'd better be out

00:14:42.832 --> 00:14:43.700
there, too."
 

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.240
And they're all out there.
 

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.259
As some wag once puts it,
Italy gets into the game, too,

00:14:49.259 --> 00:14:53.793
with Libya and Ethiopia,
with "a huge appetite and

00:14:53.793 --> 00:14:56.340
bad teeth,"
as someone once put it.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.740
Of course, they get defeated in
the battle in 1896.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:04.495
Then they will pay them back
with poison gas and cascades of

00:15:04.495 --> 00:15:07.988
bombs in the 1930s,
and just destroy everybody and

00:15:07.988 --> 00:15:09.649
kill them all,
if they can,

00:15:09.649 --> 00:15:13.168
to pay them back for their
defeat in 1896.

00:15:13.168 --> 00:15:18.440
I am eventually going to talk
about the culture of imperialism

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.500
and give you the example,
which I find telling,

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.600
of Robert Baden-Powell and the
origins of the Boy Scouts.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.601
You didn't associate the Boy
Scouts with imperialism,

00:15:28.601 --> 00:15:30.158
but you will in a minute.
 

00:15:30.158 --> 00:15:33.259
First, let me just say that
this is not some sort of

00:15:33.259 --> 00:15:35.875
‘70s radical guy
saying--there he goes

00:15:35.875 --> 00:15:39.583
again--;"it's really nasty
to be slaughtering hundreds of

00:15:39.583 --> 00:15:41.529
thousands of people."
 

00:15:41.529 --> 00:15:43.330
But it is nasty,
and that's what they did.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.940
That cannot be forgotten.
 

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:50.349
It doesn't just start with the
famous case of the Germans in

00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:51.769
Southwest Africa.
 

00:15:51.769 --> 00:15:53.139
More about that in a minute.
 

00:15:53.139 --> 00:15:56.828
Bugeaud, the name is quite
forgettable but who's a general

00:15:56.828 --> 00:15:57.798
from Limoges.
 

00:15:57.798 --> 00:16:02.548
The French conqueror Algiers
anyway in 1830 is a political

00:16:02.548 --> 00:16:03.548
diversion.
 

00:16:03.548 --> 00:16:07.740
Gradually they expand their
control over Algeria.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.350
Algeria becomes a colony.
 

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:15.118
It becomes an integral point of
view--from the point of view of

00:16:15.118 --> 00:16:17.417
the French,
in a different way than

00:16:17.417 --> 00:16:19.620
Tunisia, and Vietnam,
or Morocco,

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:23.518
and other places of France,
even though it's not part of

00:16:23.518 --> 00:16:24.500
metropolitan France.
 

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:30.875
Bugeaud and his successors kill
about 850,000 people during the

00:16:30.875 --> 00:16:34.269
campaign, very unequal battles.
 

00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:38.268
Bugeaud comes up with the idea
of simply putting men,

00:16:38.268 --> 00:16:40.831
women,
and children into these huge

00:16:40.831 --> 00:16:43.908
caves and caverns,
and then simply throwing bombs

00:16:43.908 --> 00:16:45.299
in and so they all die.
 

00:16:45.299 --> 00:16:46.889
He did that over and over again.
 

00:16:46.889 --> 00:16:49.113
It's easy to say,
"Well, the demons of the

00:16:49.113 --> 00:16:51.240
twentieth century,
they come in the twentieth

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.690
century, don't they?"
 

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.308
But, as I suggested before in
terms of the Commune,

00:16:55.308 --> 00:16:58.100
this stuff is out there in the
nineteenth century as well,

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.429
and so racist ideology is out
there in the nineteenth century.

00:17:01.429 --> 00:17:03.120
There's no doubt about it.
 

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.394
It wasn't that way in every
place, but the French experience

00:17:07.394 --> 00:17:08.990
was pretty terrible.
 

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:17.701
In the very well-documented
case of what happened in what

00:17:17.701 --> 00:17:21.550
now is Congo and Zaire,
which were sort of the private

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:25.643
colony of the king of Belgium,
the atrocities there are

00:17:25.643 --> 00:17:26.519
well-known.
 

00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:30.200
One could go on all day talking
about these atrocities.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.839
The most well-known,
certainly,

00:17:32.839 --> 00:17:37.616
and most well-documented, and,
in a way because of what comes

00:17:37.616 --> 00:17:42.834
later in the twentieth century,
is that of the conquest and

00:17:42.834 --> 00:17:44.769
indeed genocide.
 

00:17:44.769 --> 00:17:47.320
Here I'm borrowing an
appropriate term,

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.173
I think,
in this case-that's not a term

00:17:50.173 --> 00:17:53.413
you throw around very
loosely--of my friend and

00:17:53.413 --> 00:17:55.160
colleague,
Ben Kiernan,

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.259
whom some of you know,
in his big book on genocide,

00:17:58.259 --> 00:18:00.858
which Yale Press published
recently.

00:18:00.858 --> 00:18:07.519
They begin conquering Southwest
Africa in 1885.

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:12.670
So, Bismarck still has a few
years to go.

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:16.700
In their way,
as they would see it,

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:20.140
among other people were the
Herero,

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:24.433
H-E-R-E-R-O,
a Bantu group of about 75,000

00:18:24.433 --> 00:18:30.144
cattle herders who were in the
center of what would become the

00:18:30.144 --> 00:18:32.858
German colonial territory.
 

00:18:32.858 --> 00:18:36.519
Again, European powers are
putting things like borders

00:18:36.519 --> 00:18:40.092
there, boundaries,
and that has nothing to do with

00:18:40.092 --> 00:18:42.429
the way that,
particularly nomadic

00:18:42.429 --> 00:18:45.440
people--they don't have any
sense of borders.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.755
Mali, where I've been because
my daughter was just studying in

00:18:49.755 --> 00:18:53.009
Touareg in northern Mali,
north of Timbuktu.

00:18:53.009 --> 00:18:57.618
The Touareg are a people who
had no sense of borders.

00:18:57.618 --> 00:18:59.808
There were Touareg across other
borders, too.

00:18:59.808 --> 00:19:03.611
Borders are something that were
artificially constructed by

00:19:03.611 --> 00:19:05.838
these powers to say,
"Here.

00:19:05.838 --> 00:19:09.019
Our empire goes there and yours
doesn't start until there."

00:19:09.019 --> 00:19:14.182
And, so, as these people rise
up to defend their own

00:19:14.182 --> 00:19:18.940
territory, they are
systematically massacred.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:33.150
They basically first decide to
crush the uprising at all costs.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:37.618
There is in 1904 an
extermination order.

00:19:37.618 --> 00:19:42.068
That's literally the German
translation from the German.

00:19:42.068 --> 00:19:45.010
The proclamation of the local
military commander is that,

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:47.480
"The Herero people must
leave this land.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.960
If they don't I will force them
to do so by using the great

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.818
gun," that is artillery.
 

00:19:52.818 --> 00:19:54.698
"Within the German
border,"

00:19:54.698 --> 00:19:58.208
that is defined as now German,
"every male Herero armed

00:19:58.208 --> 00:20:00.430
or unarmed,
with or without cattle,

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:02.160
will be shot to death.
 

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.190
I shall no longer receive women
or children,"

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:09.655
that is spare them,
"but will drive them back

00:20:09.655 --> 00:20:11.588
to their people or have them
shot.

00:20:11.588 --> 00:20:15.519
These are my words to the
Herero people."

00:20:15.519 --> 00:20:19.230
Now, I couldn't make this up.
 

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:21.640
It's easy to say how terrible
this is, but it is terrible.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:26.825
It was part of the enterprise
and has remained part of the

00:20:26.825 --> 00:20:29.098
imperialist enterprise.
 

00:20:29.098 --> 00:20:32.616
It wasn't the goal of every
imperialist to exterminate the

00:20:32.616 --> 00:20:35.887
people who were there,
but if they got in the way in a

00:20:35.887 --> 00:20:37.368
very equal fighting.
 

00:20:37.368 --> 00:20:40.507
In India there were various
cases of soldiers complaining it

00:20:40.507 --> 00:20:43.750
was too easy shooting down the
rebels because it was just like

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:44.390
hunting.
 

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.440
It was a very British,
upper-class analogy.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.358
It was just like hunting.
 

00:20:48.358 --> 00:20:53.777
Basically what they do if they
don't shoot them they chase them

00:20:53.777 --> 00:20:58.758
out into the desert and then
they cement over the wells in

00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:01.028
the oases so they die.
 

00:21:01.028 --> 00:21:05.390
Basically they exterminate
about two-thirds of the people.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.530
There's a very excellent book
on this written by a former

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:12.064
graduate student here many moons
ago called Isabel Hull that was

00:21:12.064 --> 00:21:14.140
published four or five years
ago.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.153
The origins of this,
and again there are people now

00:21:18.153 --> 00:21:22.410
writing and saying,
"Well, it wasn't that bad.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:27.113
They brought trains to India,
ended the huge disparities in

00:21:27.113 --> 00:21:28.328
prices."
 

00:21:28.328 --> 00:21:31.608
Certainly lots of good things
did come.

00:21:31.608 --> 00:21:35.288
But looming in the background
were these massacres.

00:21:35.288 --> 00:21:37.380
The edition that I'm working on
now,

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.769
that I'm just finishing of the
book that you're kindly reading,

00:21:40.769 --> 00:21:45.700
there's a whole recent spate of
interesting literature on the

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:49.808
end of the British empire in
Kenya in the 1950s.

00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:53.990
History of the Hanged is
one.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.984
There's another one by a woman
called Caroline Elkins at

00:21:56.984 --> 00:21:57.529
Harvard.
 

00:21:57.529 --> 00:21:59.140
The title escapes me at the
moment,

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.528
but these are just fantastic,
just gripping,

00:22:01.528 --> 00:22:07.609
just chilling accounts of
essentially the mass murder,

00:22:07.609 --> 00:22:10.559
incarceration,
and murder,

00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:13.473
and shooting,
under the guise of "trying

00:22:13.473 --> 00:22:16.442
to escape"
and all of this of hundreds of

00:22:16.442 --> 00:22:17.960
thousands of people.
 

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.904
This was hidden from the
British public,

00:22:19.904 --> 00:22:21.900
just systematically by the
government.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.829
It's a long story and it's one
that we have to wrestle with.

00:22:25.829 --> 00:22:29.773
Having said that,
I want now to talk about the

00:22:29.773 --> 00:22:35.249
culture of imperialism--this is
sort of shifting gears rather

00:22:35.249 --> 00:22:40.815
rapidly--and talk about Robert
Baden-Powell and the origins of

00:22:40.815 --> 00:22:42.640
the Boy Scouts.
 

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.630
Again, because I was once asked
to leave the Boy Scouts in

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:47.654
Portland,
Oregon because I was of no use

00:22:47.654 --> 00:22:49.470
and never accumulated a single
badge,

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.200
this is not the origins of this
lecture.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.220
There's lots of stuff written
on Baden-Powell.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.670
He's an easy person to mock.
 

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:58.395
He's an easy person,
I suppose, to have some sort of

00:22:58.395 --> 00:23:00.747
respect for, too,
in a way, depending on your

00:23:00.747 --> 00:23:01.710
point of view.
 

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.039
I'm not dissing the Boy Scouts.
 

00:23:03.039 --> 00:23:04.170
Once I had people running up.
 

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.390
There was a woman who came up
who was a Girl Scout.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:07.990
She says, "Oh,
this is so cruel what you're

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.809
saying about scouting.
 

00:23:08.809 --> 00:23:09.930
It's not like that."
 

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.420
I know it's not like that now.
 

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.925
But having had some relative
who had the very strange idea of

00:23:14.925 --> 00:23:18.198
giving me, of all people,
Boys' Life as a birthday

00:23:18.198 --> 00:23:18.900
present.
 

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:23.046
I remember reading that and all
this kind of over-the-top

00:23:23.046 --> 00:23:27.044
Americana publications,
I suppose I'm reacting a little

00:23:27.044 --> 00:23:28.970
bit against that,
too.

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:32.390
But there is a point to all of
this, so the rest of this is

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.750
about Baden-Powell and the Boy
Scouts.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:40.338
Robert Baden-Powell was a
soldier.

00:23:40.338 --> 00:23:45.931
He came up with the idea of
scouting as a way of preparing

00:23:45.931 --> 00:23:51.130
British youth for imperialism
and for the next war.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:55.279
The origins of the Scouts,
in terms of its timing,

00:23:55.279 --> 00:23:58.150
that is the first decade of the
twentieth century,

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:01.720
has to be seen in terms of
these international conflicts,

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:06.118
these international great power
rivalries with which we began.

00:24:06.118 --> 00:24:09.019
It comes at the time of the
Moroccan Affair,

00:24:09.019 --> 00:24:12.941
the first Moroccan Affair and
the second Moroccan Affair in

00:24:12.941 --> 00:24:15.731
1905,1911,
when it seems like the French

00:24:15.731 --> 00:24:19.820
and the Germans will go to war
against each other and they will

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.130
bring in the other great powers.
 

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.028
More about that.
 

00:24:24.028 --> 00:24:26.318
Robert Baden-Powell was a
professional soldier.

00:24:26.318 --> 00:24:32.288
When he went back to England he
thought that British youth were

00:24:32.288 --> 00:24:35.259
cigarette-smoking,
heavy-drinking,

00:24:35.259 --> 00:24:41.482
flabby weaklings,
whether they were upper classes

00:24:41.482 --> 00:24:44.368
and, even worse,
his few lower classes,

00:24:44.368 --> 00:24:47.710
because they were underfed and
therefore smaller.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.358
He hated the Oxbridge common
rooms;

00:24:50.358 --> 00:24:53.630
he said, "With its town
life, buses, hot and cold water

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.068
laid on, everything is done for
you."

00:24:56.068 --> 00:24:58.851
The British working classes,
like the upper classes,

00:24:58.851 --> 00:25:00.160
tended to drink a lot.
 

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.517
He was sure that there'd be a
war fought in the lifetime of

00:25:04.517 --> 00:25:07.823
these same people,
and he came to the idea of

00:25:07.823 --> 00:25:08.798
scouting.
 

00:25:08.798 --> 00:25:12.970
Now, America has a role in all
of this.

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:17.098
This country has always
believed in the frontier.

00:25:17.098 --> 00:25:20.253
Those of you who had Glenda's
course in American history and

00:25:20.253 --> 00:25:22.446
other people know about the
Turner Thesis,

00:25:22.446 --> 00:25:24.798
about always you can expand to
the west.

00:25:24.798 --> 00:25:28.279
You can diffuse your social
tensions in the east by giving

00:25:28.279 --> 00:25:32.005
people access to land further on
and get rid of the Indians in

00:25:32.005 --> 00:25:33.410
the way, etc.,
etc.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:38.666
Now, we have friends in France
who still read The Last of

00:25:38.666 --> 00:25:40.358
the Mohicans.
 

00:25:40.358 --> 00:25:44.519
There's just a fascination with
the American frontier.

00:25:44.519 --> 00:25:50.730
This is extremely important in
the end of the nineteenth

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:52.990
century in Europe.
 

00:25:52.990 --> 00:26:01.830
Baden-Powell borrows the
uniform of the Boy Scouts from

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:10.509
the frontier uniform as he
imagined it in America--the

00:26:10.509 --> 00:26:14.329
cowboy hat,
the flannel shirt,

00:26:14.329 --> 00:26:19.390
their neckerchief,
the short pants.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.554
He said, "The shape of a
face gives a good guide to a

00:26:22.554 --> 00:26:25.220
man's character,"
this sort of firm face.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.348
He loved that.
 

00:26:26.348 --> 00:26:28.618
Square jaw, compared to
working-class

00:26:28.618 --> 00:26:31.393
"loafers"
and "shirkers,"

00:26:31.393 --> 00:26:32.779
as he called them.
 

00:26:32.779 --> 00:26:35.640
It's this cult of masculinity.
 

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.470
This comes at a time,
one must say,

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:43.195
when you've got very aggressive
movement for female suffrage by

00:26:43.195 --> 00:26:47.387
the suffragettes who want the
rights of women to vote in

00:26:47.387 --> 00:26:50.178
Britain,
one of whom throws herself in

00:26:50.178 --> 00:26:52.348
front of a horse at a horse
race,

00:26:52.348 --> 00:26:55.108
and sacrifices her life to make
a point.

00:26:55.108 --> 00:26:59.190
It comes at a time as the
famous Oscar Wilde trial.

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.068
Oscar Wilde, of course, was gay.
 

00:27:02.068 --> 00:27:08.417
There was a sense that the
virility of English manhood was

00:27:08.417 --> 00:27:14.990
being tested by women--
Baden-Powell did not like women,

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:19.527
he referred to women as
"silly women,"

00:27:19.527 --> 00:27:23.390
"silly girls"--and by
gays,

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:27.630
whom he saw as effeminate and
therefore not really British,

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:28.828
and wouldn't be there.
 

00:27:28.828 --> 00:27:32.710
What good could they do in the
next war?

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:35.582
Also it's a time where in
Germany particularly,

00:27:35.582 --> 00:27:38.328
but not only in Germany,
men were dueling.

00:27:38.328 --> 00:27:40.558
There's sort of that test of
masculinity.

00:27:40.558 --> 00:27:43.173
If you're lucky you'll end up
with a dueling scar and not

00:27:43.173 --> 00:27:44.200
actually get killed.
 

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.450
Most of them don't get killed.
 

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:46.900
But they're dueling all over
the place.

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.920
They're dueling in the woods
outside of Paris.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.000
They're dueling almost
everywhere in Germany.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.098
They're dueling still in
Britain.

00:27:53.098 --> 00:27:55.419
That sort of reaffirmation,
according to Bob Nye and lots

00:27:55.419 --> 00:27:57.240
of other people,
and all sorts of people have

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.068
written on this.
 

00:27:58.068 --> 00:27:59.349
Ute Frevert,
, my colleague,

00:27:59.349 --> 00:28:01.200
is now gone from Yale,
unfortunately.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.970
This is part of the
reaffirmation of virility.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.230
The tendency is to say,
looking back,

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:08.751
"Well,
they're taking it out on

00:28:08.751 --> 00:28:11.176
animals,
blowing the hell out of them

00:28:11.176 --> 00:28:14.259
and indigenous people,
etc., etc."

00:28:14.259 --> 00:28:17.588
So, scouting for boys takes off.
 

00:28:17.588 --> 00:28:21.361
It spreads from Britain to
Australia to Canada to New

00:28:21.361 --> 00:28:25.058
Zealand to India to Chile to
Argentina to Brazil.

00:28:25.058 --> 00:28:29.068
In 1910 it starts in the United
States.

00:28:29.068 --> 00:28:33.247
In 1910, Baden-Powell resigns
from the command of a division

00:28:33.247 --> 00:28:37.779
of the Territorial Army to spend
the rest of his life involved in

00:28:37.779 --> 00:28:38.700
scouting.
 

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.173
Again, what I'm saying is that
involves this sort of grafting

00:28:42.173 --> 00:28:44.490
on this idea of the American
frontier.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.048
You're going to create your new
frontier.

00:28:46.048 --> 00:28:49.118
Your new frontier is going to
be in Africa.

00:28:49.118 --> 00:28:52.630
Your new frontier is going to
be in Afghanistan.

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:58.202
You create your frontiers,
and then you hold the frontiers

00:28:58.202 --> 00:29:03.288
and you train these boys,
these young men to hold the

00:29:03.288 --> 00:29:05.440
colonial frontier.
 

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.829
He finds sponsorship in the
Daily Telegraph,

00:29:08.829 --> 00:29:11.608
which was a big conservative
newspaper.

00:29:11.608 --> 00:29:13.690
All of the big newspapers are
conservative.

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:17.730
The 60,000 scouts--I think I
sent this around--by 1909

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.400
there's 60,000 scouts in
Britain.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.920
In 1910 there are 107,000.
 

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:28.569
In 1913,152,000,
and in 1917,194,000.

00:29:28.569 --> 00:29:32.528
Why was there such a short gap?
 

00:29:32.528 --> 00:29:36.349
Not that much of a leap between
1913 and 1917?

00:29:36.349 --> 00:29:37.920
Because they're dead.
 

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.410
They get killed in the war.
 

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:41.769
They're going off to fight.
 

00:29:41.769 --> 00:29:44.868
Scouting is finished rather
early.

00:29:44.868 --> 00:29:47.434
You've got these big rallies,
enormous in London,

00:29:47.434 --> 00:29:49.838
and scouts coming from all over
the empire.

00:29:49.838 --> 00:29:54.507
Girl Scouts are created in
1914, but Baden-Powell didn't

00:29:54.507 --> 00:29:56.460
care much about that.
 

00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:00.663
Now, there had been groups of
frontier-inspired youth

00:30:00.663 --> 00:30:05.108
organizations that existed in
Scotland, particularly.

00:30:05.108 --> 00:30:09.045
They're called things like The
Sons of Daniel Boone,

00:30:09.045 --> 00:30:13.134
The Woodcraft Indians,
The Boys' Brigade in Glasgow in

00:30:13.134 --> 00:30:13.829
1883.
 

00:30:13.829 --> 00:30:15.828
Some were church sponsored.
 

00:30:15.828 --> 00:30:19.387
Again, this is the sort of
moralization of the working

00:30:19.387 --> 00:30:20.059
classes.
 

00:30:20.059 --> 00:30:22.180
You get them into groups.
 

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.446
They won't smoke cigarettes,
which is a good thing not to

00:30:24.446 --> 00:30:24.650
do.
 

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:25.670
They won't drink.
 

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:27.858
They won't hang out with the
wrong people.

00:30:27.858 --> 00:30:32.752
They will go to work and become
cogs in Britain's industrial

00:30:32.752 --> 00:30:33.500
empire.
 

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:38.566
They, too, can look at maps of
Africa being increasingly

00:30:38.566 --> 00:30:43.078
painted red, which was the color
of the empire.

00:30:43.078 --> 00:30:48.558
So, nature remains a part of
this.

00:30:48.558 --> 00:30:52.184
Again, to repeat,
the cult of the American

00:30:52.184 --> 00:30:55.809
frontiersmen,
let me say a little bit more

00:30:55.809 --> 00:30:58.640
about that, is part of this.
 

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.190
The idea of the frontiersmen,
the buckskin man.

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:08.713
Rudyard Kipling is not my kind
of poet, but anyway,

00:31:08.713 --> 00:31:12.759
he expresses often this idea.
 

00:31:12.759 --> 00:31:15.890
There's something hidden;
go and find it--what's happened?

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:18.599
I must have pushed something.
 

00:31:18.599 --> 00:31:20.990
I pushed something.
 

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:22.058
It doesn't matter.
 

00:31:22.058 --> 00:31:25.298
I'm not easily alarmed--Go and
find it.

00:31:25.298 --> 00:31:29.065
Go and look behind the ranges,
something behind the ranges is

00:31:29.065 --> 00:31:30.759
lost and waiting for you.
 

00:31:30.759 --> 00:31:32.170
Go!
 

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:37.020
Baden-Powell described the
frontiersman whose manhood is

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.019
strong and rich,
of a pure life.

00:31:40.019 --> 00:31:45.209
Now, his own predilection is
that for him a life would not

00:31:45.209 --> 00:31:49.579
involve "silly women,"
as he put it.

00:31:49.579 --> 00:31:55.769
The other idea,
and this is not at all,

00:31:55.769 --> 00:31:58.980
I'm not saying anything about
his sexuality,

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.519
but the reality of the
situation is that he preferred

00:32:02.519 --> 00:32:05.380
the company of young men to
anyone else.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.818
This is involved in the way he
lived his life.

00:32:07.818 --> 00:32:14.300
The idea is that the free man
must earn independence with his

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:14.950
gun.
 

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:18.761
This is, again,
part of this old American

00:32:18.761 --> 00:32:22.861
western idea,
but you apply it to indigenous

00:32:22.861 --> 00:32:23.910
people.
 

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:27.608
Now, you have aggressive models
coming from the American West.

00:32:27.608 --> 00:32:32.368
William "Wild Bill"
Cody, from my wife's state of

00:32:32.368 --> 00:32:35.980
Nebraska, had killed thousands
of buffalo.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.670
He had dueled.
 

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:43.380
The duels that they do with the
German dueling fraternities,

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.890
you've got the equivalent in
Dodge City, and all of this,

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:48.988
where you're dueling,
and the classic kind of Clint

00:32:48.988 --> 00:32:50.358
Eastwood western.
 

00:32:50.358 --> 00:32:53.198
He'd killed thousands of
buffalo, dueled,

00:32:53.198 --> 00:32:56.250
and he's a killer and scalper
of Indians.

00:32:56.250 --> 00:33:00.839
He was his own publicist and he
had enormous influence in

00:33:00.839 --> 00:33:01.660
Britain.
 

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:05.423
At the Battle of Little Big
Horn in 1876,

00:33:05.423 --> 00:33:08.809
he kills Indian Chief Yellow
Hand.

00:33:08.809 --> 00:33:11.730
In 1887 he crosses the Atlantic.
 

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:14.798
He goes to London,
Paris, and Berlin.

00:33:14.798 --> 00:33:19.250
Queen Victoria came out of her
extended period of decades of

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:23.853
mourning for her dear husband,
Albert, to attend the Wild Bill

00:33:23.853 --> 00:33:24.910
Cody Show.
 

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:26.400
She wants to go.
 

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.440
And she's there with all the
others.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.578
She hadn't been to an event
like that in twenty-six years.

00:33:32.578 --> 00:33:38.715
The irony is that Wild Bill
Cody runs these fake combats

00:33:38.715 --> 00:33:44.852
between the Indians and the
cowboys in the equivalent of

00:33:44.852 --> 00:33:47.529
stadiums in Britain.
 

00:33:47.529 --> 00:33:50.420
One of the ironies of this
about art and reality merging is

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.310
that some of the people he
brought across the Atlantic were

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:56.251
Indians who'd actually fought in
a battle against him in the

00:33:56.251 --> 00:33:59.243
Dakotas,
and he hires them as extras and

00:33:59.243 --> 00:34:01.849
he takes them to Paris,
to London,

00:34:01.849 --> 00:34:03.089
and to Berlin.
 

00:34:03.089 --> 00:34:06.970
They are a big, huge success.
 

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:09.739
It's the Wild West program.
 

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:13.242
At the same time in Canada,
those of you who are Canadian

00:34:13.242 --> 00:34:16.619
know about the Mounted Police
and all that business.

00:34:16.619 --> 00:34:18.849
The Mounted Police become a
powerful,

00:34:18.849 --> 00:34:21.820
though somewhat tamer,
more acceptable,

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.699
more vanilla equivalent of
that,

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:29.010
of keeping order in Saskatoon
and all of these places like

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:29.539
that.
 

00:34:29.539 --> 00:34:30.699
I've actually been to Saskatoon.
 

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:32.820
It's a pretty nice place.
 

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:38.195
The idea of these mountain
men--now the mountain men get

00:34:38.195 --> 00:34:39.268
uniforms.
 

00:34:39.268 --> 00:34:43.356
The mountain men are no longer
sort of taking pot shots at

00:34:43.356 --> 00:34:47.371
people in Kentucky on the
frontier or scalping Indians in

00:34:47.371 --> 00:34:48.518
the Dakotas.
 

00:34:48.518 --> 00:34:51.070
They're wearing sort of
freelance scalpers.

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:53.447
They're wearing the uniform of
these countries and they're

00:34:53.447 --> 00:34:54.449
big-time imperialists.
 

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:56.239
That's really the point.
 

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:59.224
Here's a verse,
I can't remember where I got

00:34:59.224 --> 00:34:59.710
that.
 

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:04.500
Our mission is to plant the
right of British freedom here.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:08.820
Restrain the lawless savages
and protect the pioneer.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:09.639
(It rhymes.)
 

00:35:09.639 --> 00:35:13.532
And ‘tis a proud and
daring trust to hold these vast

00:35:13.532 --> 00:35:16.059
domains, But with 300 mountain
man

00:35:16.059 --> 00:35:19.324
You've got to kind of make it
rhyme a little bit--mountain

00:35:19.324 --> 00:35:22.190
man, pronounce it as if you were
a mountain man.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.030
But anyway, and that's a little
harder to do if you have an

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:27.039
Oxbridge accent,
which I clearly don't.

00:35:27.039 --> 00:35:30.114
Also, this is part of the
whole-- I don't have time to do

00:35:30.114 --> 00:35:30.610
it now.
 

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:32.860
I spent a fair amount of time
in Australia,

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.541
but it's also part of the idea
of being Australian,

00:35:35.541 --> 00:35:35.969
too.
 

00:35:35.969 --> 00:35:38.230
Anyway, that's another thing.
 

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:41.016
Kipling's Lost Legion is
really just awful,

00:35:41.016 --> 00:35:43.423
but here we go:
There is a legion that was

00:35:43.423 --> 00:35:45.809
never listed
That carries no colors or crest

00:35:45.809 --> 00:35:47.449
But split in a thousand
detachments

00:35:47.449 --> 00:35:49.130
Is breaking the road to the
rest

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:50.851
(I'm supposed to be more
respectful when I do this,

00:35:50.851 --> 00:35:52.154
but anyway…)
Our fathers,

00:35:52.154 --> 00:35:55.181
they left us their blessing
They taught us and groomed us

00:35:55.181 --> 00:35:57.572
and crammed
But we're shaking the clubs and

00:35:57.572 --> 00:35:59.972
the messes
To go and find out and be

00:35:59.972 --> 00:36:03.980
damned, dear boys
To go and shot and be damned,

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:04.989
dear boys.
 

00:36:04.989 --> 00:36:09.954
Virility, adventure,
loyalty--loyalty to boys,

00:36:09.954 --> 00:36:14.039
loyalty to young men,
and brotherhood,

00:36:14.039 --> 00:36:17.460
and so it starts like that.
 

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.760
Can I barely go on?
 

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.920
Out from the woods of the Great
Northwest

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:24.351
Under the austral sky
From the south and the north,

00:36:24.351 --> 00:36:27.019
they'll come forth
At the sound of the mother's

00:36:27.019 --> 00:36:28.972
cry
And each at his post where the

00:36:28.972 --> 00:36:31.539
danger is most
Will stand as a sentry then

00:36:31.539 --> 00:36:34.000
Britishers all to stand or to
fall

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.900
The Empire's frontiersmen.
 

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:41.215
Now, Baden-Powell is his own
best publicist,

00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:45.530
even better than Wild Bill Cody
had been.

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:48.539
He helps plant newspaper
articles about him.

00:36:48.539 --> 00:36:50.039
Here's one from 1900.
 

00:36:50.039 --> 00:36:52.298
"It has been suggested
that Major-General

00:36:52.298 --> 00:36:55.413
Baden-Powell's unrivaled skill
as a cavalry scout forms a quite

00:36:55.413 --> 00:36:58.074
remarkable inheritance of
heredity that he's descended

00:36:58.074 --> 00:37:00.650
from Pocahontas,
the American Indian

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:03.789
princess,"
which he was clearly not.

00:37:03.789 --> 00:37:06.230
But how does he become so
popular?

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:10.679
How do these God-awful poems
that I've just read,

00:37:10.679 --> 00:37:13.369
how do they become popular?
 

00:37:13.369 --> 00:37:17.454
They become popular because
they become the stuff of boys

00:37:17.454 --> 00:37:20.590
literature of the culture of
imperialism.

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:22.693
They were the British
equivalents of Boys'

00:37:22.693 --> 00:37:23.219
Life.
 

00:37:23.219 --> 00:37:25.170
I'm not knocking Boys'
Life.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.079
I don't know if that existed.
 

00:37:27.079 --> 00:37:30.742
I strongly preferred Sports
Illustrated and the sporting

00:37:30.742 --> 00:37:31.630
news to that.
 

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:34.650
They become the stuff that
people are reading as they're

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:37.780
looking at these maps of Africa
gradually becoming painted

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:38.440
British.
 

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.329
Now, how did he become well
known?

00:37:41.329 --> 00:37:42.980
Well, because he's an
imperialist.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:44.268
He's fighting.
 

00:37:44.268 --> 00:37:46.985
In 1896 he fought in the
Matabele War,

00:37:46.985 --> 00:37:50.291
which I sent around,
not the war but the name,

00:37:50.291 --> 00:37:54.329
a skirmish against about 1,000
indigenous fighters.

00:37:54.329 --> 00:37:59.733
It's at that point where he
starts coming up with his own

00:37:59.733 --> 00:38:05.619
freelance uniform that would
become that of the Boy Scouts.

00:38:05.619 --> 00:38:10.626
In military units people that
were scouts, again the idea of

00:38:10.626 --> 00:38:11.559
tracking.
 

00:38:11.559 --> 00:38:14.324
You're tracking,
you're seeing where the Indians

00:38:14.324 --> 00:38:15.030
have been.
 

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:17.289
The Indians can see where
you've been now.

00:38:17.289 --> 00:38:18.659
You learn how they do it.
 

00:38:18.659 --> 00:38:21.510
How the blades of grass turn
and all of that.

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:22.989
I couldn't scout anything.
 

00:38:22.989 --> 00:38:25.489
You see how they do it.
 

00:38:25.489 --> 00:38:28.327
They become known as scouts,
which is sort of an

00:38:28.327 --> 00:38:30.019
Americanization of a term.
 

00:38:30.019 --> 00:38:33.460
This is what he likes to do.
 

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:37.369
Teddy Roosevelt,
there's a good example of that.

00:38:37.369 --> 00:38:40.762
Talk about that kind of
narcissism of the colonial

00:38:40.762 --> 00:38:44.429
imagination and the imperial
imagination, "Rough,

00:38:44.429 --> 00:38:46.300
rough, we're the stuff.
 

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.059
We want to fight and we can't
get enough."

00:38:48.059 --> 00:38:49.130
Whoopie!
 

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:54.596
That's the song of the Rough
Riders from the Cuban-American

00:38:54.596 --> 00:38:59.684
War of Teddy Roosevelt,
so it's part of the hysteria of

00:38:59.684 --> 00:39:02.230
the U.S. Spanish War.
 

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:04.760
But again, it's the frontier
spirit.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:08.940
Baden-Powell helps create his
own myth, which I've said.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:12.550
He drew pictures of the people
that he had allegedly shot.

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:16.550
These pictures end up being in
the tabloid newspapers.

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:19.882
Again, the role of the tabloids
in spreading all this stuff is

00:39:19.882 --> 00:39:21.030
terribly important.
 

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:23.751
I said before there's
twenty-one daily newspapers in

00:39:23.751 --> 00:39:24.820
Paris at the time.
 

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.009
I don't remember how many there
are in Britain,

00:39:27.009 --> 00:39:28.768
but there are an awful lot of
them.

00:39:28.768 --> 00:39:32.021
He sketched a last stand of
eight people,

00:39:32.021 --> 00:39:36.574
supposedly until they get
rescued, against the indigenous

00:39:36.574 --> 00:39:37.469
people.
 

00:39:37.469 --> 00:39:41.469
He claimed that the Zulus,
against whom the British War,

00:39:41.469 --> 00:39:46.027
the Zulus called him,
this sounds unlikely,

00:39:46.027 --> 00:39:48.606
"the man,
he who likes to lie down to

00:39:48.606 --> 00:39:49.268
shoot."
 

00:39:49.268 --> 00:39:52.780
The Ashanti called him,
in awe, this was his term for

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.550
himself, "he of the big
hat."

00:39:55.550 --> 00:40:02.282
And that in this war in 1896,
they called him "the

00:40:02.282 --> 00:40:07.518
wolf," in awe again,
his opponents.

00:40:07.518 --> 00:40:10.835
"The beast that does not
sleep but sneaks around at

00:40:10.835 --> 00:40:11.679
night."
 

00:40:11.679 --> 00:40:15.639
So, he became "the wolf
who never sleeps."

00:40:15.639 --> 00:40:19.639
There's a slight problem with
this invention of a term to

00:40:19.639 --> 00:40:23.780
describe himself as "the
wolf who sneaks around,"

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.710
is there aren't any wolves in
Africa.

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:28.469
There are not any wolves at all.
 

00:40:28.469 --> 00:40:30.798
He made it up and made it up
rather badly,

00:40:30.798 --> 00:40:33.639
having taken it out of some
book somewhere else.

00:40:33.639 --> 00:40:36.501
But that doesn't stop the
tabloids from referring to him

00:40:36.501 --> 00:40:38.739
as "the wolf who never
sleeps."

00:40:38.739 --> 00:40:44.920
The Boers understand that in
the Boer War,

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.849
that is the Dutch Afrikaner
opposition opponents,

00:40:47.849 --> 00:40:49.523
who by the way--the British
created the term

00:40:49.523 --> 00:40:50.809
"concentration camp."
 

00:40:50.809 --> 00:40:52.929
Again, I'm not looking back
from history.

00:40:52.929 --> 00:40:58.630
They're separating children and
women from the men,

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:05.472
and trying to avoid that they
receive provisioning out in the

00:41:05.472 --> 00:41:06.500
bush.
 

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.153
They create the term
"concentration camp"

00:41:09.153 --> 00:41:10.110
in the Boer War.
 

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:13.170
The Boers actually lived there
and had for a long time,

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:15.550
though they're not an
indigenous people.

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:17.400
They know there aren't any
wolves there.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.800
So, they start mocking
Baden-Powell.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:23.914
But "he of the big
hat" did not slow down at

00:41:23.914 --> 00:41:24.380
all.
 

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:29.521
So, in 1899,
he has the good luck to be at

00:41:29.521 --> 00:41:36.043
the siege of Mafeking,
where they are surrounded by a

00:41:36.043 --> 00:41:41.940
force, but not a terribly
aggressive force.

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:47.248
Again, he draws pictures of
people on duty and all of that,

00:41:47.248 --> 00:41:48.440
night duty.
 

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:53.780
And the town had resisted 217
days stationed on the railway

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:58.110
line that runs between the Cape
and Rhodesia.

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:05.300
This was a big takeoff for his
reputation.

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:10.679
Just the name Baden-Powell,
the initials B.P.

00:42:10.679 --> 00:42:13.039
become identified with British
imperialism.

00:42:13.039 --> 00:42:16.610
B.P, "He loves the night
and after his return from the

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:19.231
hollows of the veldt,
where he has kept so many

00:42:19.231 --> 00:42:21.744
anxious vigils,
he lies awake hour after hour

00:42:21.744 --> 00:42:25.333
upon his camp mattress in the
veranda tracing out in his mind

00:42:25.333 --> 00:42:28.862
the various means and agencies
by which he can forestall the

00:42:28.862 --> 00:42:31.789
Boer move,
which unknown to them he has

00:42:31.789 --> 00:42:33.760
personally already watched.
 

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:38.309
He is the wolf who never
sleeps."

00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:41.784
Now, B.P., those initials also
become British Pluck,

00:42:41.784 --> 00:42:44.510
the idea that the British are
mudders.

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:49.097
This is kind of the image that
would come out of the very

00:42:49.097 --> 00:42:54.177
heroic Battle of Britain under
the bombs of German Luftwaffe in

00:42:54.177 --> 00:42:55.570
World War II.
 

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:58.724
British Pluck,
also B.P., British Peerage,

00:42:58.724 --> 00:43:01.184
British Peers,
the upper classes,

00:43:01.184 --> 00:43:03.340
the title British Peers.
 

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:09.800
He becomes identified with all
of this, the wolf who never

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:10.820
sleeps.
 

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:16.588
His advice to his own garrison
is to "sit tight and shoot

00:43:16.588 --> 00:43:17.630
straight.
 

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:20.090
All is well here,"
he writes.

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:22.623
They were able to get messages
out to the newspapers who are

00:43:22.623 --> 00:43:23.309
covering this.
 

00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:27.516
Now, again, the British
newspapers covered another siege

00:43:27.516 --> 00:43:30.958
which ends rather badly,
which is at Khartoum,

00:43:30.958 --> 00:43:34.400
with the death of Charles
Chinese Gordon.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:39.219
He was called Chinese Gordon
because he slaughtered the

00:43:39.219 --> 00:43:42.699
Chinese, and he gets his at
Khartoum.

00:43:42.699 --> 00:43:45.882
Of course, school children,
there's an enormous,

00:43:45.882 --> 00:43:49.809
enormous outpouring of tears
over the death of this man.

00:43:49.809 --> 00:43:52.331
The newspapers,
because of these modern

00:43:52.331 --> 00:43:56.313
techniques, they can follow all
of this stuff pretty much how

00:43:56.313 --> 00:43:58.570
the siege is going,
etc., etc.

00:43:58.570 --> 00:43:59.193
So, B.P.
 

00:43:59.193 --> 00:44:02.626
the prince of good fellows,
prince of scouts,

00:44:02.626 --> 00:44:03.719
here we go.
 

00:44:03.719 --> 00:44:04.920
They emphasize his youth.
 

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.639
He's forty-three but he's
youthful.

00:44:06.639 --> 00:44:08.030
He's cheerful.
 

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.628
He's always whistling and
telling stories,

00:44:10.628 --> 00:44:12.719
even when things are going bad.
 

00:44:12.719 --> 00:44:15.260
He loves pranks,
childish pranks.

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:17.309
This is from some of the
newspapers.

00:44:17.309 --> 00:44:19.802
"Life was a game,
but you have to play it

00:44:19.802 --> 00:44:20.800
honorably."
 

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.242
It was a game that silly women,
as he called them,

00:44:23.242 --> 00:44:24.090
could not play.
 

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:28.326
He becomes known again as
sports, mass sports is starting

00:44:28.326 --> 00:44:29.840
just at this time.
 

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:33.030
The Olympics are starting just
at this time.

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:40.150
Again, there's a reassertion of
virility in these Olympics.

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:44.030
He's called "the gallant
goalkeeper,"

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:47.489
"the goaltender of
Mafeking."

00:44:47.489 --> 00:44:53.092
So, a sports analogy becomes
part again of this imperial

00:44:53.092 --> 00:44:54.010
thrust.
 

00:44:54.010 --> 00:45:01.715
They print patriotic letters to
him, which can be signed and can

00:45:01.715 --> 00:45:02.940
be sent.
 

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:03.880
You can send a postcard.
 

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.309
You could send a postcard home.
 

00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:07.567
Your parents have left after
parents' weekend,

00:45:07.567 --> 00:45:08.320
if they came.
 

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.849
You can send them the following
postcard:

00:45:09.849 --> 00:45:13.362
Dear Parents, Dear Mom and Dad,
We have shouted "Rule

00:45:13.362 --> 00:45:14.170
Britannia!"
 

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:16.610
We have sung God Save the
Queen.

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:20.000
We have toasted gallant Baden a
half a score.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.648
We have sent our best respects
to Plucky Mafeking and we have

00:45:23.648 --> 00:45:25.960
hoisted flags and bunting in
galore.

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:29.393
With a wild and frenzied
madness born of joy the empire

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:32.889
cheers, while we Britishers
rejoice through the land.

00:45:32.889 --> 00:45:36.300
In this hour of jubilation I am
sending you a line with the wish

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.360
that I could warmly shake your
hand.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:39.920
Yours exultantly.
 

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:44.070
Then you sign your own name to
it.

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:46.556
So, scouting,
as someone said,

00:45:46.556 --> 00:45:51.648
I can't remember whom,
was an attempt to make these

00:45:51.648 --> 00:45:56.494
"values"
of Mafeking permanent and to

00:45:56.494 --> 00:46:02.813
trace them on the map of these
countries of these peoples all

00:46:02.813 --> 00:46:04.920
over the world.
 

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.701
A 1909 newspaper said:
It may be that he is not a

00:46:08.701 --> 00:46:11.376
great soldier of the sort which
Napoleon, or the Maltese,

00:46:11.376 --> 00:46:12.809
or the Kitcheners are made.
 

00:46:12.809 --> 00:46:16.648
He is the frontiersman,
the born leader of irregulars,

00:46:16.648 --> 00:46:19.980
a maverick, and the empire has
need of such.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:22.708
Furthermore,
he has the knack of seizing the

00:46:22.708 --> 00:46:26.010
imagination of boys and a deep
sympathy with them.

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:29.682
He is doing his day's work for
the empire by training a number

00:46:29.682 --> 00:46:33.416
of manly little fellows to keep
their wits about them and their

00:46:33.416 --> 00:46:34.440
eyes skinned.
 

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:39.838
We shall profit another day in
a much greater affair than

00:46:39.838 --> 00:46:40.900
Mafeking.
 

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:44.090
That, of course,
is preparing for the war

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:47.496
against those other peoples who
might contest British

00:46:47.496 --> 00:46:49.829
domination,
not the indigenous peoples,

00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:53.380
but the other powers in Africa.
 

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:57.559
So, be prepared,
B.P., the same thing,

00:46:57.559 --> 00:46:59.820
the same initials.
 

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:01.960
Anybody here a scout?
 

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.349
I had to memorize that stuff.
 

00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:06.030
I didn't get a single badge,
but a scout.

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:06.969
Be prepared.
 

00:47:06.969 --> 00:47:08.070
You're supposed to do that.
 

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:09.320
The jamborees.
 

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.090
He creates these jamborees.
 

00:47:13.199 --> 00:47:15.358
Also, at the same time,
and I don't have time to talk

00:47:15.358 --> 00:47:17.010
about this,
but this is the same time when

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:20.860
Arthur Conan Doyle,
the idea of sleuthing,

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:24.380
but it was sort of an urban
sleuthing for evildoers in

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:24.980
London.
 

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:28.829
It kind of merges with all of
that.

00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:31.659
Of boys who risked their life,
he says,

00:47:31.659 --> 00:47:33.699
"I said to one of these
boys on one occasion when he

00:47:33.699 --> 00:47:35.010
came through a rather heavy
fire,

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:37.525
‘You will get hit one of
these days riding about like

00:47:37.525 --> 00:47:38.869
that when shells are flying.'
 

00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:41.795
And he replied,
‘Sir, I pedal so quickly,

00:47:41.795 --> 00:47:43.449
they'll never catch me.'
 

00:47:43.449 --> 00:47:48.119
Those boys don't seem to mind
the bullets one bit."

00:47:48.119 --> 00:47:53.373
Of course, millions of them
would catch bullets that

00:47:53.373 --> 00:47:55.949
ultimately they minded.
 

00:47:55.949 --> 00:47:58.409
"I will do my best to God
and the king.

00:47:58.409 --> 00:47:59.750
I will do my best to help
others.

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:00.679
Whatever it costs me.
 

00:48:00.679 --> 00:48:02.949
I know the scout law and I will
obey it."

00:48:02.949 --> 00:48:05.079
Again, I am not knocking doing
good things for people.

00:48:05.079 --> 00:48:06.250
Please do understand.
 

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:10.289
But I'm just trying to place
the origins of whatever you

00:48:10.289 --> 00:48:14.331
think of the Boy Scouts in the
context of the culture of

00:48:14.331 --> 00:48:17.434
imperialism,
because that's where it belongs

00:48:17.434 --> 00:48:19.170
and that's where it started.
 

00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:24.472
In 1912 in August a boat
capsized off the coast of Devon,

00:48:24.472 --> 00:48:25.420
I think.
 

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:28.489
Nine boys from eleven to
fourteen drown.

00:48:28.489 --> 00:48:30.018
They were scouts.
 

00:48:30.018 --> 00:48:35.119
There was an enormous,
enormous national funeral

00:48:35.119 --> 00:48:41.304
service in London in which
millions of people saw at least

00:48:41.304 --> 00:48:43.039
parts of it.
 

00:48:43.039 --> 00:48:44.829
This helped.
 

00:48:44.829 --> 00:48:47.579
Their deaths,
and many more deaths would

00:48:47.579 --> 00:48:52.021
follow, helped tie together the
idea of scouting with service to

00:48:52.021 --> 00:48:53.079
the nation.
 

00:48:53.079 --> 00:48:56.079
A magazine called The
Captain--again,

00:48:56.079 --> 00:49:00.610
this is part of the culture of
imperialism and of aggressive

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:04.911
nationalism--had a troop of
mobile scouts on bikes fitted

00:49:04.911 --> 00:49:08.673
with a rifle bucket and a clip
to carry a carbine,

00:49:08.673 --> 00:49:09.750
a rifle.
 

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:12.340
So, it shifts.
 

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:17.340
The image of all of this shifts
from Africa,

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:20.619
where much of the fighting was
already over,

00:49:20.619 --> 00:49:24.659
and indigenous people destroyed
or pacified,

00:49:24.659 --> 00:49:30.289
to the European enemies against
whom the next war would be

00:49:30.289 --> 00:49:31.179
fought.
 

00:49:31.179 --> 00:49:35.284
There's a famous cartoon in the
British magazine Punch

00:49:35.284 --> 00:49:38.635
which showed a Boy Scout
complete in uniform being

00:49:38.635 --> 00:49:40.757
prepared, taking
Mrs. Britannia,

00:49:40.757 --> 00:49:43.630
that is the image of Victoria
who was dead,

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:47.530
but the female image of the
empire, by the arm.

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:49.690
It says, "Fear not,
grandma.

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:52.340
No danger can befall you.
 

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:54.916
I, after all,
remember I am with you

00:49:54.916 --> 00:49:55.800
now."
 

00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:00.903
Boy Scouts played an enormous
role in 1914 and in the

00:50:00.903 --> 00:50:02.768
subsequent years.
 

00:50:02.768 --> 00:50:05.280
"Goodbye,
I'm off to war."

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:10.092
There was a caricature in the
newspaper as Boy Scouts joined

00:50:10.092 --> 00:50:14.907
up along with lots of other
people who weren't scouts in the

00:50:14.907 --> 00:50:15.559
war.
 

00:50:15.559 --> 00:50:18.666
As you well know,
they don't come back,

00:50:18.666 --> 00:50:21.530
or a lot of them don't come
back.

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:25.365
It's part of the mood of
nationalism and of imperialism,

00:50:25.365 --> 00:50:27.110
of the New Imperialism.
 

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:30.132
Those two things are tied
together and the expectation,

00:50:30.132 --> 00:50:33.041
indeed in many cases,
as in the case of Baden-Powell,

00:50:33.041 --> 00:50:34.329
joyous expectation.
 

00:50:34.329 --> 00:50:38.458
You could test your virility in
a more meaningful combat than

00:50:38.458 --> 00:50:41.280
simply slaughtering indigenous
people,

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:46.429
or picking off Boers with
greater numerical superiority.

00:50:46.429 --> 00:50:50.246
By the way,
Robert Baden-Powell died in

00:50:50.246 --> 00:50:53.978
Kenya, in 1941,
from which he had just sent his

00:50:53.978 --> 00:50:56.670
last patriotic message to the
Boy Scouts,

00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:59.809
in what was a very different
war.

00:50:59.809 --> 00:51:01.159
Thank you.
 

00:51:01.159 --> 00:51:02.959
I'll see you on Wednesday.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.024
Professor Langdon
Hammer: W.H.

00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:20.770
Auden, Wystan Hugh Auden.
 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:28.454
There really is no more
dramatic contrast in this

00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:35.978
course, I think,
than to go from late Stevens to

00:00:35.978 --> 00:00:43.013
early Auden.
Stevens is born twenty years

00:00:43.013 --> 00:00:49.044
before Auden.
Auden goes on writing to his

00:00:49.044 --> 00:00:55.141
death in 1973,
so his career is somewhat later

00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:58.422
than Stevens.
But again, we're doing

00:00:58.422 --> 00:01:03.269
something a little complicated;
we're moving from Stevens's

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.574
poems of the late 1940s,
early 1950s,

00:01:07.574 --> 00:01:12.000
now to Auden and his early
career,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.099
including poems written in the
very late 1920s,

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:21.755
in the 1930s,
and we'll get up to the start

00:01:21.755 --> 00:01:26.299
of World War Two by the end of
class.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.706
So, in one sense,
we're going back in time,

00:01:29.706 --> 00:01:34.330
back in literary history,
and back in cultural history,

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.047
moving from the 1950s,
from this post-war moment,

00:01:39.047 --> 00:01:43.470
in which Stevens is writing his
late poems,

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.560
to an earlier phase.
 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.488
At the same time we are also,
however, moving forward,

00:01:51.488 --> 00:01:54.650
in a sense, in literary
history;

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.575
moving forward to a poetry that
is distinctly and variously a

00:02:01.575 --> 00:02:05.730
poetry that comes after
modernism,

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.377
and to that extent that we
could think of as

00:02:09.377 --> 00:02:16.470
post-modernist.
Well, what do we mean by that?

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:24.715
What do I mean?
With Stevens in mind,

00:02:24.715 --> 00:02:29.010
there are no giants in Auden.
 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.430
Everything is life-size.
 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.539
Poems don't take the place of
mountains.

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:40.952
Rather, they,
you could say,

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:44.706
take place among them,
and mountains figure

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:49.889
interestingly in Auden's poetry
in a number of places.

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:57.199
In Auden, there is no new
knowledge of reality to be had.

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:04.427
In fact, there's only old
wisdom that nobody wants to

00:03:04.427 --> 00:03:08.502
face.
Modernism turns on a kind of

00:03:08.502 --> 00:03:14.185
axis, you could say;
modernism as wasteland or as

00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:21.017
bridge, a state of cultural
decay and crisis or of promise

00:03:21.017 --> 00:03:27.129
and celebration – Pound and
Eliot on one side,

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.819
maybe Crane and Stevens on the
other.

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.620
Well, Auden is beyond these
debates.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.770
They don't matter much to him.
 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:44.278
He is, in a sense,
beyond the nostalgia of the one

00:03:44.278 --> 00:03:51.185
side, and he's also quite
self-consciously beyond the

00:03:51.185 --> 00:03:56.100
romantic exultation of the
other.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.530
Auden is a British poet.
 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.688
He writes out of a distinctly
British tradition,

00:04:07.688 --> 00:04:12.847
a tradition in which,
well, tradition itself is,

00:04:12.847 --> 00:04:16.579
in a sense, taken for granted.
 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.107
It's something that's there,
accessible, part of the poet's

00:04:22.107 --> 00:04:27.920
repertoire that needn't be
either struggled for or against.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.134
Industrial capitalism – Hart
Crane is all excited about this

00:04:34.134 --> 00:04:40.109
stuff.
It's an old thing in the north

00:04:40.109 --> 00:04:50.427
of England, and Auden's early
poems take place in a landscape

00:04:50.427 --> 00:04:57.649
of now fading and century-old
industry.

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:01.804
Early Auden,
later Auden:

00:05:01.804 --> 00:05:11.671
these are caricatures that are
important to the history of

00:05:11.671 --> 00:05:15.480
Auden's reception.
 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:23.269
There's been a tendency to see
his career as coming in two

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:30.649
halves, divided by his
immigration to the United States

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:37.620
at the very end of 1938:
a British Auden and then an

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.172
American Auden.
Both Audens,

00:05:42.172 --> 00:05:48.060
you could say,
have distinct caricatures.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.726
Early Auden.
Early Auden:

00:05:52.726 --> 00:05:58.780
a poet born in the city of
York, the son of a doctor,

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:05.066
interested in natural science
and in scientific ways of

00:06:05.066 --> 00:06:09.930
knowing;
a poet for whom science was not

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.658
an enemy but rather a kind of
tool, a point of view or

00:06:15.658 --> 00:06:21.772
perspective,
expressed importantly for early

00:06:21.772 --> 00:06:28.823
Auden in the work of Freud;
the work of Freud but also the

00:06:28.823 --> 00:06:32.570
work of Marx.
The early Auden is not an

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:38.118
orthodox Marxist and certainly
not a Communist Party member,

00:06:38.118 --> 00:06:41.410
but Marxism is important to
him.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.079
It's part of a worldview.
 

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:49.976
It's worked into his sense of
the world as seen where social

00:06:49.976 --> 00:06:55.672
classes compete and struggle
with each other and where the

00:06:55.672 --> 00:07:00.470
important choices to be made are
moral ones,

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:07.790
moral ones that enter into our
political choices.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:17.241
It's also the case in Auden's
early poetry that he tends to

00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:27.670
conceive of the world in a kind
of "us and them" construction.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:34.934
There's a sense in the early
poems of extreme privacy in the

00:07:34.934 --> 00:07:39.255
privacy of address,
the way in which the poet

00:07:39.255 --> 00:07:42.171
speaks to us,
the way in which he conceives

00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:43.629
his point of view.
 

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:50.666
These early poems conceive a
kind of, you could say,

00:07:50.666 --> 00:07:57.290
coterie audience who are
Auden's intellectual,

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:06.541
leftist, largely gay friends at
Oxford, where he's writing his

00:08:06.541 --> 00:08:12.631
earliest poems.
Homosexuality is an important

00:08:12.631 --> 00:08:20.017
context for this early Auden and
his ways of imagining himself

00:08:20.017 --> 00:08:22.560
and talking to us.
 

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:31.200
Auden comes with a kind of
embattled, necessarily secretive

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:39.990
and self-protective investment
in intimate relationships.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:44.429
They're something that has to
be fought for.

00:08:44.429 --> 00:08:53.044
They are prized and they are
something that must be protected

00:08:53.044 --> 00:09:01.660
from the intrusions of other
hostile or disapproving eyes.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:06.149
 
 

00:09:06.149 --> 00:09:11.630
Yes, let's look at an early
poem here.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:21.360
This is in your RIS packet.
 

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.950
 
 

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:31.250
"From the Very First Coming
Down," it's called.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:37.419
I'll show you some photos first
before getting to the poem.

00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:42.768
This is one I like of the
Oxford Auden,

00:09:42.768 --> 00:09:48.821
a sensitive boy,
with the interesting legend

00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:57.830
that he has applied to himself
here, probably in retrospect.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.759
"The cerebral life would pay,"
he says.

00:10:01.759 --> 00:10:07.149
He was going to make it work to
be an intellectual.

00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:16.019
This is another one:
Auden, the rakish young Auden;

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:23.647
this one also with a kind of
legend on top in Auden's hand

00:10:23.647 --> 00:10:29.000
where he calls himself "utopian
youth,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.786
grown old Italian," as,
in fact, this was a certain

00:10:34.786 --> 00:10:42.076
kind of trajectory he would live
starting as a utopian youth and

00:10:42.076 --> 00:10:49.830
then later learning how to relax
and have a good time in Italy.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:57.385
Let's see.
I'm afraid I've got my slides

00:10:57.385 --> 00:11:00.559
somewhat backward.
 

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:05.780
This is Auden's Poems,
his first book.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.799
I believe it's 1930.
 

00:11:07.799 --> 00:11:13.718
They're written while he's a
student at Oxford and it

00:11:13.718 --> 00:11:20.319
includes poems that are – this
one that I'll discuss in a

00:11:20.319 --> 00:11:26.692
moment but it's worth seeing
them on the page – they're

00:11:26.692 --> 00:11:35.001
laid out without titles again,
somewhat as Williams's early

00:11:35.001 --> 00:11:38.159
poems are presented.
 

00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:43.594
They are set here almost sort
of secretively,

00:11:43.594 --> 00:11:47.917
I'd like to say,
without that public

00:11:47.917 --> 00:11:54.624
introduction of a title and,
well, as I'm suggesting,

00:11:54.624 --> 00:12:01.166
some degree of self-protection
and reticence are important

00:12:01.166 --> 00:12:07.250
qualities and in fact themes of
this early poetry.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:13.010
Let's take a look at this poem
that I've got up on the screen

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:19.059
right now, which is called "From
the Very First Coming Down."

00:12:19.059 --> 00:12:27.039
That's the first line of the
poem and it's generally known

00:12:27.039 --> 00:12:29.694
that way.
From the very first

00:12:29.694 --> 00:12:33.233
coming down
Into a new valley with a frown

00:12:33.233 --> 00:12:37.940
[already we're listening to a
poet who rhymes]

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.970
Because of the sun and a lost
way,

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:47.480
You certainly remain [there's a
"you" here, there's an "I."

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.063
The poem is a kind of letter
and, in fact,

00:12:51.063 --> 00:12:53.860
a kind of love letter]:
to-day

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:59.677
I, crouching behind a sheep-pen
[and this is that Northern

00:12:59.677 --> 00:13:06.920
landscape that
Auden comes from], heard

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.465
Travel across a sudden bird,
Cry out against the storm,

00:13:11.465 --> 00:13:14.769
and found
The year's arc a completed round

00:13:14.769 --> 00:13:18.750
And love's worn circuit
re-begun,

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.490
Endless with no dissenting turn.
 

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:27.230
Shall see, shall pass,
as we have seen

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.020
The swallow on the tile,
Spring's green

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:34.129
Preliminary shiver, passed
A solitary truck, the last

00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:38.050
Of shunting in the Autumn [and
so on].

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.532
…
Your letter comes,

00:13:41.532 --> 00:13:47.262
speaking as you,
Speaking of much but not to

00:13:47.262 --> 00:13:51.489
come.
The letter comes in a sense

00:13:51.489 --> 00:13:56.138
from an intimate,
a friend, perhaps a lover,

00:13:56.138 --> 00:14:01.760
saying much and yet we're given
no content to it.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.559
It's veiled in that sense.
 

00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:10.350
It's speaking of much but much
that is "not to come," it seems;

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:15.840
its very content and promises,
it seems, are withheld.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.990
Then there's this further
stanza.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:25.360
Nor speech is close nor
fingers numb,

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:31.043
If love not seldom has received
An unjust answer,

00:14:31.043 --> 00:14:36.306
was deceived.
This early Auden has this

00:14:36.306 --> 00:14:42.321
highly compressed syntax that
requires you to kind of put the

00:14:42.321 --> 00:14:48.136
sentences together and fill in
parts that seem to have been

00:14:48.136 --> 00:14:53.350
occluded in the poet's
compressing of language;

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:57.650
again, an almost veiled form of
speech.

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:01.883
Auden says:
I, decent with the

00:15:01.883 --> 00:15:06.522
seasons, move
Different or with a different

00:15:06.522 --> 00:15:11.049
love [there's a sense that the
love that

00:15:11.049 --> 00:15:16.519
animates him is a different
love, it sets him apart],

00:15:16.519 --> 00:15:22.070
Nor [he doesn't]
question overmuch the nod,

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:25.560
The stone smile of this country
god

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:32.749
That never was more reticent,
Always afraid to say more than

00:15:32.749 --> 00:15:37.894
it meant.
There's an intimacy that the

00:15:37.894 --> 00:15:43.891
poem establishes here with the
"you" and with us as readers

00:15:43.891 --> 00:15:49.959
that suggests a kind of implied,
shared knowledge that the poem

00:15:49.959 --> 00:15:54.694
nonetheless does not openly
declare and doesn't specify but

00:15:54.694 --> 00:15:57.470
rather remains reticent about .
 

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:04.654
And we're invited into that
reticence, as well as the poet's

00:16:04.654 --> 00:16:11.960
scruple, expressed here as the
wisdom of that country god,

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.705
which--it's hard to know
exactly how we're supposed to

00:16:15.705 --> 00:16:18.956
interpret that,
whether that's an actual figure

00:16:18.956 --> 00:16:22.559
or a kind of stone in the
landscape that the poet is

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:25.740
animating in this way:
but in any case,

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:30.906
seeing that figure,
that country god as emblematic

00:16:30.906 --> 00:16:37.549
of a reticence that scruples not
"to say more than it meant."

00:16:37.549 --> 00:16:43.475
In other words,
well, you could compare this to

00:16:43.475 --> 00:16:50.560
Marianne Moore's investment in
"restraint," very closely

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.940
related in its moral valences.
 

00:16:54.940 --> 00:17:01.567
The idea here is one that's
crucial in Auden throughout his

00:17:01.567 --> 00:17:06.710
career: that is,
the poet wishes to master his

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.910
intentions as a speaker.
 

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:15.514
He does not wish to say more
than he means,

00:17:15.514 --> 00:17:23.121
and he means to say what he
means and to insist on meaning

00:17:23.121 --> 00:17:28.759
what he says.
This is a long way from--it's

00:17:28.759 --> 00:17:35.730
very different from Wallace
Stevens's lavish forms of play,

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:43.103
his interest in inexactness or
poems that might "resist the

00:17:43.103 --> 00:17:47.680
intelligence almost
successfully."

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:55.079
Auden wants very much to say
what he means and he wants us to

00:17:55.079 --> 00:17:58.039
be able to grasp that.
 

00:17:58.039 --> 00:18:05.360
Auden conceives of poetry,
and of language generally,

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:14.369
as a sphere of moral action in
which truth is always at stake,

00:18:14.369 --> 00:18:21.616
where the poet's specific
office is to control and use

00:18:21.616 --> 00:18:28.589
language in a kind of
responsible and honest way.

00:18:28.589 --> 00:18:32.079
This is a poet who wants to be
honest.

00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:35.680
Poets have not always wished
this.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:40.217
You can think about Hart Crane
saying, "sleep,

00:18:40.217 --> 00:18:44.554
death, desire,
hasten, while they are true":

00:18:44.554 --> 00:18:50.655
in other words,
Crane's willing investment in

00:18:50.655 --> 00:18:59.460
what he recognizes as illusion
or a kind of temporary truth.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:05.327
Auden is, rather,
morally bound to,

00:19:05.327 --> 00:19:10.849
responsible for,
what he says.

00:19:10.849 --> 00:19:17.612
He's concerned in this sense
with the limits of poetry,

00:19:17.612 --> 00:19:21.619
with saying only what's meant.
 

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:27.294
Again, a connection should be
drawn to Marianne Moore who

00:19:27.294 --> 00:19:31.549
shares something with Auden in
this way.

00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:35.140
You remember her long poem
"Poetry": "I,

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:38.731
too, dislike it:
there must be something

00:19:38.731 --> 00:19:42.230
important beyond all this
fiddle,"

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:47.129
and yet after "reading it…
with a perfect contempt for it,

00:19:47.129 --> 00:19:51.529
one discovers nonetheless a
place for the genuine,"

00:19:51.529 --> 00:19:54.150
she says, or something very
close to that.

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:57.729
Well, that's the beginning,
in Moore's case,

00:19:57.729 --> 00:20:02.641
of a very long and extravagant
poem which over the course of

00:20:02.641 --> 00:20:06.761
her career,
as she returned to it and

00:20:06.761 --> 00:20:13.766
sought to tell the truth in her
poem and to insist on what was

00:20:13.766 --> 00:20:17.963
genuine,
she eventually cut to only

00:20:17.963 --> 00:20:22.097
those lines.
Moore was, as a poet,

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:29.592
a rigorous self-reviser who
cuts out pieces of her poems and

00:20:29.592 --> 00:20:36.580
who cuts out individual poems
from her body of work.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:42.536
So was Auden.
Auden, importantly,

00:20:42.536 --> 00:20:49.340
revised his own poems,
sometimes on multiple

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:57.727
occasions, always as he
collected them and returned to

00:20:57.727 --> 00:21:02.000
them in later volumes.
 

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.974
There are a couple important
examples of this,

00:21:08.974 --> 00:21:15.329
including the poem "Spain" on
page 791,

00:21:15.329 --> 00:21:24.173
a poem that Auden wrote in
response to the anti-Fascist

00:21:24.173 --> 00:21:30.070
struggle in the Spanish Civil
War,

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.220
which he participated in.
 

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:44.601
And it is a poem that complexly
and yet nonetheless strongly

00:21:44.601 --> 00:21:56.982
comes to affirm the priority of
making political commitments

00:21:56.982 --> 00:22:05.062
over and above,
it appears, individual,

00:22:05.062 --> 00:22:16.450
moral discriminations and other
forms of individual commitment.

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:22.629
And there are ideas expressed
in this poem that became an

00:22:22.629 --> 00:22:29.359
anthem in one of Auden's most
famous poems of the thirties.

00:22:29.359 --> 00:22:34.971
Well, let me give you just a
few lines from it,

00:22:34.971 --> 00:22:36.680
on page 793.
 

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:44.230
 
 

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:50.022
Stirring us to march,
Auden says, "To-morrow,

00:22:50.022 --> 00:22:56.737
perhaps the future… /
To-morrow the rediscovery of

00:22:56.737 --> 00:23:00.950
romantic love…" and so on.
 

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:06.646
But: To-day [on line 93]
the deliberate increase in the

00:23:06.646 --> 00:23:08.958
chances of death,
[even]

00:23:08.958 --> 00:23:13.960
The conscious acceptance of
guilt in the necessary murder;

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.950
To-day the expending of powers
On the flat ephemeral pamphlet

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:22.646
and the boring meeting.
He's calling us to do the work

00:23:22.646 --> 00:23:28.980
of revolution and postpone as a
goal the rediscovery of romantic

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.500
love and other utopian projects.
 

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:37.715
Auden would come to find the
morality of this poem

00:23:37.715 --> 00:23:44.102
objectionable and to repudiate
the notion that we should ever

00:23:44.102 --> 00:23:48.680
accept guilt in "the necessary
murder,"

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.879
that rather,
any murder would be necessary

00:23:51.879 --> 00:23:54.220
in order to advance a cause.
 

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.746
And expressing his own
self-censure,

00:23:56.746 --> 00:23:59.200
he cut the poem out of his
work.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.633
If you buy Auden's Collected
Poems, edited by his

00:24:03.633 --> 00:24:08.309
executor, Edward Mendelson,
you will find that this poem is

00:24:08.309 --> 00:24:14.539
not in there.
There are other examples of

00:24:14.539 --> 00:24:18.859
dramatic self-revision.
 

00:24:18.859 --> 00:24:24.663
Let me just point to one more
that is famous in the poem

00:24:24.663 --> 00:24:30.572
"September 1,1939," again,
one of Auden's most celebrated

00:24:30.572 --> 00:24:33.210
and circulated poems.
 

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:40.098
He has in the next-to-last
stanza these assertions,

00:24:40.098 --> 00:24:45.884
on page 803,
"All I have…" This is a poem

00:24:45.884 --> 00:24:53.599
occasioned by the beginning of
the Second World War.

00:24:53.599 --> 00:24:59.004
It positions the poet in a dive
in Manhattan,

00:24:59.004 --> 00:25:01.829
drinking with others.
 

00:25:01.829 --> 00:25:08.630
He's reflecting on the European
catastrophe now underway.

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:10.360
He says: All I have is a
voice

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.520
To undo the folded lie,
The romantic lie in the brain

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.380
Of the sensual man-in-the-street
And the lie of Authority

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:23.488
Whose buildings grope the sky:
There is no such thing as the

00:25:23.488 --> 00:25:26.090
State
And no one exists alone;

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:30.099
Hunger allows no choice
To the citizen or the police;

00:25:30.099 --> 00:25:33.380
We must love one another or
die.

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:41.545
As your note below registers,
"Auden later attempted to

00:25:41.545 --> 00:25:47.377
revise this line,"
which struck him as--in fact,

00:25:47.377 --> 00:25:52.412
he called it "incurably
dishonest," and he revised it

00:25:52.412 --> 00:25:57.349
first with what seemed to him a
more truthful claim:

00:25:57.349 --> 00:26:03.255
"We must love one another and
die" because we're going to have

00:26:03.255 --> 00:26:05.869
to die, in any case.
 

00:26:05.869 --> 00:26:14.409
And eventually he gave up on it
altogether and cut the entire

00:26:14.409 --> 00:26:18.593
stanza.
These are examples of Auden

00:26:18.593 --> 00:26:24.721
applying a kind of stringent
moral self-examination to the

00:26:24.721 --> 00:26:29.426
language that he uses,
and it's a crucial part not

00:26:29.426 --> 00:26:33.309
only of the history of his work
– in other words,

00:26:33.309 --> 00:26:34.432
what he did with it – but
what, of course,

00:26:34.432 --> 00:26:38.261
he was doing in it;
which was attempting to speak

00:26:38.261 --> 00:26:44.710
in a truthful way that he could
take responsibility for,

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:51.267
and yet which led him
repeatedly to forms of rhetoric

00:26:51.267 --> 00:26:56.690
that he would mistrust and later
abandon.

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:02.873
All of this is consistent with
the ways in which Auden

00:27:02.873 --> 00:27:07.190
reconceived the modern poet's
role.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:13.009
Auden writes against vatic,
romantic inspiration.

00:27:13.009 --> 00:27:18.033
He sees the modern poet as a
kind of rationalist,

00:27:18.033 --> 00:27:23.475
a rationalist especially
skilled in the techniques of

00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:31.211
poetry and of language use,
as expressed specifically in

00:27:31.211 --> 00:27:38.109
technical mastery of verse form
and genre.

00:27:38.109 --> 00:27:46.179
Auden reclaims,
following Pound,

00:27:46.179 --> 00:27:54.769
Anglo-Saxon alliterative meter.
 

00:27:54.769 --> 00:28:03.149
He writes in popular ballad
forms, all kinds of song forms,

00:28:03.149 --> 00:28:08.349
and many kinds of rhyme and
meter.

00:28:08.349 --> 00:28:11.374
He takes over,
you could say,

00:28:11.374 --> 00:28:17.529
song forms from the British
music hall, which is something

00:28:17.529 --> 00:28:21.879
like vaudeville.
He produces intricate,

00:28:21.879 --> 00:28:27.950
stanzaic patterns that we might
find in metaphysical poetry.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:30.986
He produces ornate,
syllabic poems,

00:28:30.986 --> 00:28:34.380
not unlike Marianne Moore
sometimes.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:43.973
He influentially revives the
Provençal forms of the sestina

00:28:43.973 --> 00:28:51.289
and the canzone and other
troubadour forms.

00:28:51.289 --> 00:28:57.869
If your poetry writing teachers
have made you write sestinas,

00:28:57.869 --> 00:29:04.119
you have Auden to thank for
this, as well as much else.

00:29:04.119 --> 00:29:10.882
There is, in these various acts
of appropriation and reclaiming

00:29:10.882 --> 00:29:15.789
of verse forms,
a kind of – no nostalgia.

00:29:15.789 --> 00:29:19.905
Rather, there's a sense that
all these forms are simply

00:29:19.905 --> 00:29:23.114
available.
They should be part of a poet's

00:29:23.114 --> 00:29:26.785
toolkit.
And this is also part of what

00:29:26.785 --> 00:29:33.106
is, well, Auden's presentation
of himself as a kind of expert,

00:29:33.106 --> 00:29:38.910
as a poet with expertise:
with expertise in language.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:42.388
And all of this is part of,
in his early poetry,

00:29:42.388 --> 00:29:46.460
what you would have to call his
precocious adultness,

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:52.542
his knowingness which is,
again, connected to his will to

00:29:52.542 --> 00:29:57.429
tell the truth,
to tell the truth unclouded by

00:29:57.429 --> 00:30:00.736
sentiment.
The early Auden,

00:30:00.736 --> 00:30:07.212
the Auden that we see in those
photographs, he's remarkably

00:30:07.212 --> 00:30:09.780
cool, in all senses.
 

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.970
This is a cool poet.
 

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:19.713
James Merrill,
a poet who was a friend of

00:30:19.713 --> 00:30:27.299
Auden's and influenced by him in
many ways,

00:30:27.299 --> 00:30:32.866
once remarked that all of
Auden's poems were written on

00:30:32.866 --> 00:30:36.680
paper on which the tears had
dried.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:40.880
And that's an evocative idea.
 

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:45.371
It's important first of all
that yes, those tears have

00:30:45.371 --> 00:30:48.655
dried.
But it's also important that

00:30:48.655 --> 00:30:50.329
there were tears.
 

00:30:50.329 --> 00:30:54.987
And both of these are
properties of the poems and they

00:30:54.987 --> 00:30:58.589
make Auden a special kind of
love poet.

00:30:58.589 --> 00:31:07.579
Let's look at the early poem,
"This Lunar Beauty," which is

00:31:07.579 --> 00:31:09.750
on page 787.
 

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:19.450
 
 

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:22.710
This lunar beauty
Has no history

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:27.970
Is complete and early;
If beauty later

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:31.930
Bear any feature
It had a lover

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:38.312
And is another.
This like a dream [this love

00:31:38.312 --> 00:31:43.470
that I experienced and write of
and out of]

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:49.970
Keeps other time [it's lunar]
And daytime is

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:53.760
The loss of this;
For time is inches

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.190
And the heart's changes
Where ghost has haunted

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:01.720
Lost and wanted.
But this was never

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.630
A ghost's endeavour
Nor, finished this,

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:07.150
Was ghost at ease;
And till it pass

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:09.420
Love shall not near
The sweetness here

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:14.750
Nor sorrow take
His endless look.

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:20.409
Contrast this poem to a closely
related poem,

00:32:20.409 --> 00:32:27.740
Hart Crane's "Voyages," a poem
of extravagant rhetoric.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:32.214
Here, Auden is not writing
iambic pentameter,

00:32:32.214 --> 00:32:36.180
he's writing--what is the meter
here?

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:40.890
Dimeter: there are two beats
per line.

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:45.123
You can't have a line that's
much shorter and have it be a

00:32:45.123 --> 00:32:47.944
line or a meter.
It's really,

00:32:47.944 --> 00:32:54.380
in a sense, the smallest
measure meter can sustain.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:59.324
There is in the poem a kind of
formal reticence,

00:32:59.324 --> 00:33:04.899
and what is proclaimed as
endless here is not love but

00:33:04.899 --> 00:33:07.950
sorrow, or sorrow's look.
 

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:14.530
And sorrow is personified there
in the position of the poet,

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:20.553
looking at the beloved,
already in a sense looking back

00:33:20.553 --> 00:33:23.900
at him – a lunar beauty.
 

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:33.197
Let's turn a few pages forward
to page 790 and read another of

00:33:33.197 --> 00:33:38.990
Auden's love poems,
closely related.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:41.430
Lay your sleeping head,
my love,

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:47.540
Human on my faithless arm;
Time and fevers burn away

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:51.965
Individual beauty from
Thoughtful children,

00:33:51.965 --> 00:33:56.120
and the grave
Proves the child ephemeral:

00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:03.830
But in my arms till break of day
Let the living creature lie,

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:13.920
Mortal, guilty, but to me
The entirely beautiful. …

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:19.638
Certainty, fidelity
On the stroke of midnight pass

00:34:19.638 --> 00:34:23.860
[they always do,
they are bound to]

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:28.610
Like vibrations of a bell,
And fashionable madmen raise

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:32.740
Their pedantic boring cry:
Every farthing of the cost,

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:35.414
All the dreaded cards foretell,
Shall be paid,

00:34:35.414 --> 00:34:40.820
but from this night
Not a whisper, not a thought,

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:46.239
Not a kiss nor look be lost.
 

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:49.920
[You're going to have to pay
for it.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:54.816
But here it is,
and it is now and to be

00:34:54.816 --> 00:35:00.340
celebrated.]
Beauty, midnight, vision dies:

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:05.170
Let the winds of dawn that blow
Softly round your dreaming head

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:09.632
Such a day of sweetness show
Eye and knocking heart may

00:35:09.632 --> 00:35:13.890
bless,
Find the mortal world enough;

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:19.650
Noons of dryness see you fed
By the involuntary powers,

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:26.853
Nights of insult let you pass
Watched by every human

00:35:26.853 --> 00:35:32.718
love.
Here again, love is seen in the

00:35:32.718 --> 00:35:39.199
secularizing light of certain
future betrayal and loss.

00:35:39.199 --> 00:35:46.059
To be living here is to be
mortal and guilty.

00:35:46.059 --> 00:35:53.424
To love is to be sure that you
will be faithless,

00:35:53.424 --> 00:36:01.586
that is, to love fully;
and so to know love and beauty

00:36:01.586 --> 00:36:10.528
entirely and in their entirety
is to know them in the knowledge

00:36:10.528 --> 00:36:17.739
of time, to know precisely that
love's passing.

00:36:17.739 --> 00:36:23.710
Time here is not so much a kind
of emblem of human inconstancy,

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:29.295
but rather of something like
natural law, to which everyone

00:36:29.295 --> 00:36:33.572
is subject.
This is the theme of the very

00:36:33.572 --> 00:36:39.530
great poem, written in popular
ballad form, with this title in

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:45.880
Auden's Collected Poems:
"As I Walked Out One Evening,"

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.930
on page 793.
 

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:52.949
 
 

00:36:52.949 --> 00:36:55.560
As I walked out one
evening,

00:36:55,560 --&gt; 00:37:60,000
Walking down Bristol Street,
The crowds upon the pavement

00:37:60,000 --&gt; 00:37:02,350
Were fields of harvest wheat.
 

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:06.650
And down by the brimming river
I heard a lover sing

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:12.540
Under an arch of the railway
[and here is his song]:

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.230
"Love has no ending.
 

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:18.660
"I'll love you,
dear, I'll love you

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:22.161
Till China and Africa meet
And the river jumps over the

00:37:22.161 --> 00:37:24.449
mountain
And the salmon sing in the

00:37:24.449 --> 00:37:27.680
street.
"I'll love you till the ocean

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:32.090
Is folded and hung up to dry
And the seven stars go squawking

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:34.510
Like geese about the sky.
 

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:36.680
"The years shall run like
rabbits

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.150
For in my arms I hold
The Flower of the Ages

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:42.390
And the first love of the
world."

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:45.769
 
 

00:37:45.769 --> 00:37:48.662
[Have you ever said that?
 

00:37:48.662 --> 00:37:56.960
Has someone said that to you?]
But all the clocks in the city

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:02.600
Began to whirr and chime [and
they say]:

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:07.670
"O let not Time deceive you,
You cannot conquer Time.

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:10.390
"In the buroughs of the
Nightmare

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:16.360
Where Justice naked is,
Time watches from the shadow

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.740
And coughs when you would kiss.
 

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:24.070
"In headaches and in worry
Vaguely life leaks away,

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:30.450
And Time will have his fancy
To-morrow or to-day.

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:34.140
"Into many a green valley
Drifts the appalling snow;

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:39.470
Time breaks the threaded dances
And the diver's brilliant bow.

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:45.460
"O plunge your hands in water
Plunge them in up to the wrist;

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:50.730
Stare, stare in the basin
And wonder what you've missed.

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:53.260
"The glacier knocks in the
cupboard,

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:57.453
The desert sighs in the bed,
And the crack in the tea-cup

00:38:57.453 --> 00:39:01.139
opens
A lane to the land of the dead.

00:39:01.139 --> 00:39:03.800
"Where the beggars raffle the
banknotes

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.519
And the Giant is enchanting to
Jack,

00:39:06.519 --> 00:39:09.050
And the Lily-white Boy is a
Roarer

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:12.930
And Jill goes down on her back.
 

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:18.450
"O look, look in the mirror,
O look in your distress;

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:25.760
Life remains a blessing
Although you cannot bless.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:32.219
"O stand, stand at the window
As the tears scald and start;

00:39:32.219 --> 00:39:34.510
You shall love your crooked
neighbour

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:38.119
With your crooked heart."
 

00:39:38.119 --> 00:39:42.120
It was late,
late in the evening,

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:46.717
The lovers they were gone;
The clocks had ceased their

00:39:46.717 --> 00:39:51.710
chiming,
And the deep river ran on.

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:54.780
This is a ballad.
 

00:39:54.780 --> 00:40:03.398
Auden's choice of it suggests
that the song form is conveying

00:40:03.398 --> 00:40:10.150
popular common wisdom,
something we all know.

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:18.000
It's expressing truth as a kind
of commonplace that is shared,

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.960
like the tune itself.
 

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.110
Truth is not an elite knowledge.
 

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:29.510
It's something that's out there
in the street,

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:33.949
and it touches all of us in
common.

00:40:33.949 --> 00:40:39.110
There are here in the poem two
distinct voices in quotation

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:43.648
marks: first the lover's and
then the voice of time,

00:40:43.648 --> 00:40:48.625
of the clocks.
The lover, when he speaks,

00:40:48.625 --> 00:40:56.676
well, the poem seems to say or
seems to acknowledge he's lying,

00:40:56.676 --> 00:41:02.000
even if he doesn't know it or
mean to.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.867
And yet the poem still allows
him his truth,

00:41:06.867 --> 00:41:10.463
his say.
What it does really is it

00:41:10.463 --> 00:41:14.997
frames his truth with this
other, larger truth,

00:41:14.997 --> 00:41:19.630
which is time's truth uttered
by the clocks.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:24.170
And the clocks speak from the
point of view of disenchantment.

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:27.610
The lover cannot wash his hands.
 

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:33.960
The poem gives us a kind of
image of primary sinfulness;

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.469
again, how different from
Stevens!

00:41:36.469 --> 00:41:45.983
Ordinary life here is haunted
by, disrupted by elemental

00:41:45.983 --> 00:41:50.034
forces;
"the glacier knocks in the

00:41:50.034 --> 00:41:54.509
cupboard."
The domestic includes tragic

00:41:54.509 --> 00:41:57.440
and uncanny dimensions.
 

00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:02.769
They return like repressed
parts of the psyche in the poem.

00:42:02.769 --> 00:42:09.775
And still there is a kind of
consolation in view in that

00:42:09.775 --> 00:42:17.036
ambiguous promise or command
that you and I will love each

00:42:17.036 --> 00:42:24.880
other;
our "crooked" hearts will meet.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:29.916
There's a sense in which people
are bound to each other

00:42:29.916 --> 00:42:35.512
precisely by the circumstances
that the poem describes and by

00:42:35.512 --> 00:42:38.869
the crookedness of their hearts.
 

00:42:38.869 --> 00:42:43.749
At the end then the lovers and
the clocks are all gone,

00:42:43.749 --> 00:42:46.460
both, and the river runs on.
 

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:49.760
There's that last stanza.
 

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:55.780
Poetry in Auden speaks on
behalf of necessity,

00:42:55.780 --> 00:43:01.800
necessity that frames what we
do and think;

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:07.362
necessity that determines the
circumstances within which we

00:43:07.362 --> 00:43:09.760
make our moral choices.
 

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:13.949
In this way Auden,
like Bishop whom we'll read

00:43:13.949 --> 00:43:19.815
next week, is a poet constantly
drawing our attention to matters

00:43:19.815 --> 00:43:23.539
of perspective:
how things are seen,

00:43:23.539 --> 00:43:29.643
how things are framed,
what the context of any given

00:43:29.643 --> 00:43:34.670
point of view or utterance or
action is.

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:40.139
What is true and what is right
from one point of view may not

00:43:40.139 --> 00:43:44.518
be from another.
And this is part of the

00:43:44.518 --> 00:43:51.425
principle by which Auden comes
to, in fact, revise and make

00:43:51.425 --> 00:43:58.332
decisions about his own work
that involve censoring his own

00:43:58.332 --> 00:44:02.569
language.
The great poem about this

00:44:02.569 --> 00:44:07.193
theme, that is,
the way in which our knowledge

00:44:07.193 --> 00:44:13.153
and action is determined and
bounded by the perspectives in

00:44:13.153 --> 00:44:16.840
which it is viewed,
in which it takes place;

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:22.285
the great poem on this theme is
"Musée des Beaux Arts" and is

00:44:22.285 --> 00:44:27.730
also a poem that we'll have to
wait to talk about until Monday

00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:32.639
when we will talk about it in
connection with the almost

00:44:32.639 --> 00:44:38.000
contemporaneous poem,
"In Memory of W.B.
